This is particularly true in the current global \nfinancial crisis, where issues of systemic risk have not only \nnational, but regional and global implications. The contributions \nof  these  institutions  and  markets  to  the  development  and \nworsening of the crisis suggest that they need to be monitored \nand regulated more closely, but there is still disagreement about \nthe degree of regulation that is needed.\nThis policy brief examines hedge funds, private equity funds, \nand innovative financial products, particularly collateralized \ndebt obligations and asset-backed securities, as the latter are at \nthe heart of the freeze up of various financial markets. What is \nthe overall structure of these products? What role did they play \nin the development of the current global financial crisis? What \nchanges are needed in the global financial architecture related to \nthese institutions and products to strengthen financial stability \ngoing forward?\n02 | Unregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation", "2.\nHedge Funds and \nPrivate Equity Funds\nHedge funds and private equity funds have frequently been \nregarded as potential sources of systemic risk, given their lack of \nregulation  and  reporting  requirements,  high  exposure  to \ninternational financial markets, high degree of leverage, and, in \nthe case of hedge funds, the high rate of turnover in their \nportfolios and their reliance on complex investment strategies. \nIn this section, we examine the structure, performance, and role \nin the current global financial crisis of hedge funds. On the \nwhole, we found that they did not play a significant role in \ncausing the crisis, although selling pressure emanating from \nthem  did  serve  to  amplify  downward  pressure  on  financial \nmarkets at a later stage of the crisis.\nA. Hedge Funds\nThere is no widely agreed-upon definition of hedge funds, and, in \nfact, many of these funds do not use \u201chedging\u201d to manage risk. \nThey do, however, share a number of defining characteristics. \nMost importantly, they are investment funds that accept funds \nonly from very large investors (e.g., in the United States [US], \nindividuals with US$5 million or more in investment assets). \nThis allows them to avoid most, if not all regulations that apply \nto investment funds catering to smaller investors. For example, \nhedge funds typically are not required to register with the \nSecurities  and  Exchange  Commission  in  the  US,  although \nUnited Kingdom (UK)-based funds are required to register with \nUnregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation | 03", "the Financial Services Agency in the UK. Hedge funds typically \ninvest in a broad range of investments, including equities, debt, \nand commodities; invest in many international markets; and \nmake both long and short investments. They also generally \nadopt  various  sophisticated  investment  strategies  using \nstructured products. Hedge funds typically have absolute-return \ninvestment targets and fee structures highly geared to those \nreturns,  and,  most  relevantly  for  financial  stability  issues, \nemploy leverage to enhance those returns.\nAvailable data on hedge fund assets show that they rapidly rose \nfrom about US$324 billion in 1999 to US$2.2 trillion in 2007, an \nannual average growth rate of 23%. In 2008, the total number of \nhedge funds fell 9% to about 10,000 (International Financial \nServices London 2009). The level of assets, however, collapsed to \nonly US$1.5 trillion by the end of 2008, reflecting declines in \nboth market value and redemptions. Moreover, the level could \nhave been even lower, as some hedge funds adopted \u201clock-up\u201d \nprovisions  that  temporarily  prevented  redemptions  by  their \ninvestors.\nPerhaps the most counterintuitive finding about hedge funds is \nthat their overall average leverage ratio is not very high, hitting \na near-term high of about 190% in 2007, and falling to about \n120% in 2008 (McGuire and Tsatsaronis 2008). In contrast, \nregulated commercial and investment banking institutions had, \nin some cases, far higher leverage ratios of about 20 times or \nmore. These included Citigroup (19.2 times), Goldman Sachs (28 \ntimes) and Morgan Stanley (33 times) (Wall Street Journal 2008).\n04 | Unregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation", "B. Private Equity Funds\nPrivate  equity  funds  are  similar  to  hedge  funds  in  their \nstructure and regulation. However, they differ substantially \nfrom  hedge  funds  in  terms  of  their  investment  period  and \ninvestment assets. \u201cGenerally, \u201cprivate equity\u201d refers to a wide \nrange of alternative investments, including equity investments \nin unquoted companies; venture investing at early and late \nstages; large-size and mid-size buyout investing; mezzanine debt \nand  mezzanine  equity  investments;  special  situations;  and \nfinally real estate investments. Private equity also includes \nprivately negotiated investments in public companies. A \u201cprivate \nequity fund\u201d refers to a limited partnership in which the general \npartners invest in private equities on behalf of the fund\u2019s limited \npartners. Private equity funds tend to have a fixed life of 10 to \n12 years. The funds are self-liquidating structures; that is, \ngeneral partners invest the raised funds within three to five \nyears of the inception. As investments are divested, the cash \nrealizations are distributed to the limited partners over time.\u201d \n(Erturk, Cheung, and Fong 2001) Private equity funds typically \ntake a direct equity stake in companies that they regard as \nhaving good long-term prospects. Therefore, unlike hedge funds, \ntheir portfolios are quite illiquid and stable from year to year. \nLike hedge funds, private equity funds typically employ leverage \nto enhance returns. The degree of leverage varies with market \nconditions, but, between 2000 and 2005, debt averaged between \n59% and 68% of the total purchase price for leveraged buyouts \n(LBOs) in the US (Trenwith Group 2006).\nFunds managed by private equity funds also rose rapidly over \nthe past decade, going from about US$40 billion in 2000 to \nUnregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation | 05", "US$500 billion in 2007, an annual growth rate of 31%, but \nfalling  to  US$440  billion  in  2008  (International  Financial \nServices London 2008). Again, the \u201cequilibrium\u201d amount is likely \nto be significantly lower, because many investors would have \npreferred to sell, but were locked into forced contributions when \nanticipated returns from earlier years did not materialize. Also, \nin many cases these funds are still sitting on large amounts of \ncash, since the market for LBOs has collapsed.\nUnlike  loans  to  hedge  funds,  the  outstanding  amount  of \nleveraged  loans  issued  in  connection  with  LBOs  increased \nslightly to US$600 billion in 2008 (Standard and Poor\u2019s 2009). \nHowever, this increase largely reflects the long lock-up period for \nprivate equity funds. Nonetheless, the share of \u201ccovenant-lite\u201d \nand second lien loans in total loans began to shrink in mid-2007, \nreflecting tightening credit conditions and reduced appetite for \nrisky loans.\nC. Role of Highly Leveraged Funds in the Financial Crisis\nPrior  to  the  current  global  financial  crisis,  concerns  about \nsystemic risk arising from highly leveraged investors centered \non  two  categories\u2014direct  losses  of  core  institutions  on \ncounterparty exposures to such investors, and indirect losses on \nbanks\u2019 trading positions caused by forced liquidation of hedge \nfunds\u2019 positions. In fact, however, hedge funds were not a major \ncontributing factor to the start of the current crisis. Of greater \nsignificance were the direct losses experienced by internal funds \nof  investment  banks  and  the  warehoused  assets  of  banks. \nIndirect losses attributable to hedge funds started to become an \nimportant issue in 2008, when hedge funds became large-scale \n06 | Unregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation", "forced  sellers  to  meet  redemption  demands  by  investors  in \nresponse to the overall decline in financial markets. Thus, the \ncurrent  crisis  differs  from  that  of  the  Long  Term  Capital \nManagement  (LTCM)  crisis  of  1998,  when  both  direct  and \nindirect losses arising from LTCM\u2019s failure were seen as having \nsystemic risk implications. This suggests that regulation of \nhedge funds and private equity funds is not an urgent issue, \nalthough  issues  of  monitoring  and  regulation  need  to  be \nconsidered carefully.\nD. Reform Proposals\nThere is no consensus yet on whether to regulate hedge funds and \nprivate equity funds, although most recommendations focus on \nstepping  up  monitoring  and  communication  rather  than  on \nincreasing  regulation.  The  Financial  Stability  Forum  (FSF) \nreleased its most recent reports on highly leveraged institutions in \nMay  and  October  of  2007  (Financial  Stability  Forum  2007a, \n2007b). These maintained the stance of not calling for regulation \nof these entities. Instead, the reports called on authorities to \nincrease  their  surveillance  and  monitoring  of  the  risk \nmanagement activities of core institutions, and called on the hedge \nfund industry to review and enhance existing sound practice \nbenchmarks for hedge fund managers in the light of expectations \nfor improvement set out by the official and private sectors.\nThe  Basel  Committee  on  Banking  Supervision  has  taken  a \nsimilar approach, putting most of its emphasis on strengthening \nguidelines for estimating capital at risk in banks\u2019 trading books \nand making enhancements to the Basel II framework (Basel \nCommittee on Banking Supervision 2009a, 2009b). This is also \nUnregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation | 07", "implied  by  the  conclusions  of  the  so-called  de  Larosi\u00e8re \nreport issued in February of this year, which is the most \nrecent  comprehensive  European  statement  of  regulatory \nrecommendations emanating from the current crisis (European \nCommission 2009b). The report states, for example: \u201cIf banks \nengage in proprietary activities for a significant part of their \ntotal  activities,  much  higher  capital  requirements  will  be \nneeded.\u201d (European Commission 2009b: 17)\nThis is consistent with the experience that the activities of the \nregulated banks themselves were the key factor behind the current \ncrisis. However, the European Commission has indicated that it will \npublish  a  \u201ccomprehensive  legislative  instrument  establishing \nregulatory and supervisory standards for hedge funds, private \nequity and other systemically important market players.\u201d (European \nCommission 2009a: 7) The Group of Twenty (G20) communiqu\u00e9 of \nApril 2009 noted its agreement \u201cto extend regulation and oversight \nto all systemically important financial institutions, instruments and \nmarkets. This will include, for the first time, systemically important \nhedge funds.\u201d (Group of Twenty 2009)\nThe FSF also noted that the issuance of draft best practice \nstandards by the UK-based Hedge Fund Working Group, which \ninclude a \u201ccomply or explain\u201d expectation, was a notable step \ntoward improved transparency and discipline, and represented a \nrecognition by the sector of its responsibilities as a significant \nforce in the financial system (Hedge Fund Working Group 2008). \nHowever, the lack of uptake within the hedge fund industry of \nthese  recommended  principles  has  been  disappointing,  and \nleaves open the door to regulation imposed from outside.\n08 | Unregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation", "The approach of regulators to hedge funds is guided by their \ndesire to reduce the procyclicality of the financial system and its \ntendency to boom and bust. In particular, there are concerns \nabout the feedback loops between bubbles or bubble collapses in \nasset prices and their impacts on the real economy. To address \nthese  concerns,  the  FSF,  in  cooperation  with  the  Bank  for \nInternational  Settlements,  Basel  Committee  on  Banking \nSupervision, Committee on the Global Financial System, and \nother  international  bodies,  is  examining  ways  to  mitigate \nprocyclicality. The focus of the study is on capital regulations, \nloan-loss provisioning, interaction of valuation standards and \nleverage,  and  compensation  practices.  One  approach  being \nexplored is the use of \u201cthrough-the-cycle\u201d estimates of asset \nvalues.  In  addition,  the  group  recommends  that  regulators \nclosely  monitor  the  activities  of  large  hedge  funds  with  a \npotential for systemic risk and maintain an ongoing dialogue \nwith those firms.\nThe group also supports the development of a macro-prudential \nframework to monitor and address the buildup of risk in the \nfinancial system. Hedge funds and private equity funds are to be \nincluded in the monitoring process. The approach likely to be \nadopted  is  similar  to  that  of  the  UK\u2019s  Financial  Services \nAuthority,  which  focuses  on  identifying  the  potential  for \nsystemic risk. Another approach being widely considered is to \nmodify the framework for monetary policy to place more weight \non  the  importance  of  asset  price  movements.  Nonetheless, \nfurther  direct  regulatory  requirements  on  hedge  funds  and \nprivate equity funds cannot be ruled out.\nUnregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation | 09", "3.\nInnovative Products\nInnovative financial products have played a key role in the \ndevelopment  of  the  current  financial  crisis,  and  have  also \ncompounded the difficulty of resolving it. This is because the \ndifficulty of valuing such products has, in many cases, caused \nmarkets for them to cease functioning. This has led to great \nuncertainty  regarding  the  financial  position  of  institutions \nholding these products, which has, in turn, frozen the process of \ntrying to separate \u201cgood assets\u201d from \u201cbad assets,\u201d an important \nstep in restoring the normal functioning of credit markets. The \nmain  innovative  financial  products  relevant  to  the  current \nfinancial crisis are derivative products\u2014mainly credit default \nswaps (CDS) and asset-backed securities (ABS). (See glossary of \nterms in the Appendix.)\nA. Derivative Products\nDerivative products, i.e., products whose value is a function of \nthe value of other underlying financial products such as stocks, \nbonds, or loans, are a key category of innovative products. The \noverall  over-the-counter  market  for  derivative  products  has \nexpanded dramatically over the past decade, rising from US$90 \ntrillion in 1998 to nearly US$700 trillion by June of last year (in \nnotional amounts) (Bank for International Settlements 2008b). \nMajor types of derivative instruments include those related to \nforeign  exchange,  interest  rates,  equities,  commodities,  and \ncredit default swaps. Table 1 shows that interest rate contracts \n10 | Unregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation", "are still by far the largest type of derivative, making up about \ntwo-thirds of the total.\nTable 1: Notional Amounts Outstanding of \nOver-the-Counter (OTC) Derivatives\nUS$ billion, end-period  2000  2005  2006  2007  June 2008\nTotal contracts   95,200  297,666  414,845  595,341  683,725\nForeign exchange \n15,666  31,360  40,271  56,238  62,983\ncontracts  \nInterest rate contracts   64,668  211,970  291,582  393,138  458,304\nEquity-linked contracts  1,891  5,793  7,488  8,469  10,177\nCommodity contracts   662  5,434  7,115  8,455  13,229\nCredit default swaps  -  13,908  28,650  57,894  57,325\nUnallocated   12,313  29,199  39,740  71,146  81,708\nNote: - = information not available.\nSource: Bank for International Settlements (2008a).\nAmong derivatives, credit default swaps have been the greatest \nsource of systemic risk. A credit default swap is a financial \ncontract in which the protection buyer (risk shedder) pays a \nfixed periodic fee in return for a contingent payment by the \nprotection  seller  (risk  taker).  The  contingent  payment  is \ntriggered by a credit event of the entity that the contract refers \nto. Credit events, which are specified in CDS contracts, may \ninclude  bankruptcy,  default,  or  restructuring.  On  a  gross \nnotional basis, CDS grew from negligible amounts in 1998 to \nUS$58 trillion by December 2007 (about 10% of the total), \nalthough they fell substantially last year to US$32 trillion (The \nDepository Trust and Clearing Corporation 2009). The gross \nnotional value is the total value of potential payouts specified in \nthe contract. However, the net notional level, defined when a \ncredit event actually takes place, is much lower, at only about \n3%  of  the  gross  notional  value  (The  Depository  Trust  and \nUnregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation | 11", "Clearing Corporation 2009). This is because firms often both buy \nand sell protection on the same company, so the net exposure is \nreduced accordingly. The use of \u201ctrade compression,\u201d which \nreplaces existing trades with a smaller number having the same \npayoff structure, is one factor behind the recent decline in gross \nnotional value.\nThis lower net estimate for risk exposure has held for individual \nmajor bankruptcies as well. For example, in the case of Lehman \nBrothers, the gross notional value was US$72 billion, but the net \npayment  was  only  US$5.2  billion  (Bank  for  International \nSettlements 2008b). This figure is not very large, but the main \nproblem for Lehman Brothers was its exposure to collateralized \ndebt obligations (CDOs), not to CDS. Moreover, CDS markets \nbasically behaved as they were meant to, absorbing these losses \nand not freezing up the way CDO markets did.\nB. Asset-Backed Securities\nThe main source of instability and uncertainty for financial \nmarkets has been the valuation of ABS, especially mortgage-\nbacked securities. Traditional ABS are backed by the credit \nobligations of individuals, such as residential mortgage loans, \nauto  loans,  and  credit  card  balances.  Securities  backed  by \nresidential  mortgage  loans  are  called  residential  mortgage-\nbacked securities. In the case of mortgages bought by the three \ngovernment home mortgage loan agencies (the Federal National \nMortgage Association [FNMA or Fannie Mae], the Federal Home \nLoan Mortgage Corporation [FHLMC or Freddie Mac], and the \nGovernment National Mortgage Association [GNM or Ginnie \nMae]),  they  are  referred  to  as  agency  mortgage-backed \n12 | Unregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation", "securities. CDOs are similar in structure, but typically are \nbacked by investment-grade corporate loans and/or bonds. These \ninclude collateralized loan obligations, which are based on loans, \nand collateralized bond obligations, which are based on bonds. \nThe outstanding levels of these assets originating in the US and \nEurope are summarized in Table 2.\nTable 2: Securitized Assets Outstanding by Region (end-2008)\nUS$ billion   US   Europe\nAsset-backed securities (ABS)  2,658  267\nAgency mortgage-backed securities (MBS)   5,048  -\nNon-agency residential mortgage-backed \n1,275  1,487\nsecurities (RMBS)  \nCommercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS)  626  192\nCollateralized debt obligations (CDO)  -  414\nWhole business securitization (WBS)   -  55\nTotal   9,607  2,415\nNotes: (i) US figures for ABS include CDOs\n  (ii) - = information not available\nSource: European Securitisation Forum (2008).\nThe bulk of securitized assets were originated in the US (about \nUS$9.6 trillion out of a total of US$12 trillion at the end of \n2008).  Agency  MBS,  i.e.,  those  originated  by  Freddie  Mac, \nFannie Mae, and Ginnie Mae, made up just over half of that \ntotal (US$5.0 trillion). Assets originating in Europe totaled \nUS$2.4 trillion, the bulk of which were residential mortgage-\nbacked securities (European Securitisation Forum 2008).\nC. Role of Innovative Products in the Crisis\nAs  described  above,  the  CDS  market  performed  fairly  well \nduring the crisis period. However, there has been criticism that \nbuyers of CDS used short-selling of stocks as a hedge against \nUnregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation | 13", "losses, thereby aggravating market downturns. The main victim \nof CDS during the crisis was the insurer American International \nGroup (AIG), which suffered total losses of US$99 billion in 2008 \nand had to be effectively nationalized by the US government. \nAIG\u2019s  decline  was  triggered  by  losses  on  its  portfolio  of \nmortgage-backed  securities  held  by  its  financial  products \nsubsidiary,  which  resulted  in  a  reduction  of  AIG\u2019s  capital \nreserves. This decline in capital reserves, in turn, led Standard & \nPoor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s Investors Service to downgrade AIG from an \nAAA  to  an  A  rating.  These  downgrades  then  triggered \ncollateralization  requirements  under  AIG\u2019s  CDS  contracts, \nwhich were estimated to total US$450 billion. The amount of \ncollateral that AIG had to produce was about US$100 billion, \nwhich it simply did not have. In other words, AIG\u2019s whole model \nwas based on the company preserving its AAA rating.\nThe main contribution of these products to the worsening of the \ncrisis was that the markets for various kinds of asset-backed \nsecurities products froze up due to the difficulty of valuing such \nproducts. The lack of a functioning market for these assets \ncontributed greatly to market uncertainty about the financial \nposition of many financial institutions, and complicated attempts \nto aid those institutions. This undermined the banks\u2019 originate-\nto-distribute model, which has made it much more difficult for \nthem to increase lending, as it means they have been unable to \nmove existing loans off their balance sheets. For example, mutual \nfunds  stopped  buying  CDOs  after  some  money-market  fund \nvalues dropped below par due to losses incurred on those CDOs.\n14 | Unregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation", "The most spectacular bankruptcy arising from these losses and \nmarket freeze-ups was that of Lehman Brothers in September \n2008. At the time of its collapse, it was estimated to hold about \nUS$54  billion  worth  of  mortgage-backed  securities,  while \nreporting only US$26 billion worth of equity in its last quarterly \nreport  for  the  period  ending  May  2008.  Even  that  equity \nestimate was somewhat overstated. If the company\u2019s mortgage-\nbacked securities had lost half of their value, a not unlikely \nscenario, it would have wiped out the firm\u2019s equity, even without \ntaking other losses into account.\nThe direct impact on financial institutions in Asia of the losses \narising from asset-backed securities was limited due to their \nrelatively small holdings of these assets. US and European bank \nlosses arising from holdings of such assets amounted to about \nUS$910 billion as of June 2009 (Reuters 2009). Including losses \nfrom other financial institutions, the total is likely to have \nreached  about  US$1.1  trillion.  However,  losses  by  Asian \ninstitutions due to such holdings were much smaller, accounting \nfor only about 3% of this total. Nevertheless, the magnitude of \nthe losses has been significant for some institutions, primarily \nJapanese banks. Most of the impacts on Asia have been indirect, \narising either from a liquidity crunch due to a shortage of US \ndollars  in  specific  countries,  or  from  the  deterioration  in \neconomic conditions arising from the sharp decline in export \ndemand  across  the  region.  In  some  cases,  particularly  in \nSingapore and Hong Kong, China, many individuals suffered \nlosses on derivatives-related savings products whose risks were \noften not adequately explained.\nUnregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation | 15", "D. Reform Proposals\nThe magnitude and widespread nature of the current financial \ncrisis  highlights  failures  in  many  areas  of  monitoring  and \nregulation that need to be analyzed and reformed. These include \nregulations  for  origination,  distribution,  and  trading  of \nderivatives  and  asset-backed  securities;  gaps  in  regulatory \ncoverage; the Basel II capital adequacy rules; rules regarding \ngovernment  takeover  of  systemically  important  financial \ninstitutions  that  are  failing;  the  scope  for  international \ncooperation and surveillance; and the role of rating agencies and \nregulators.  Greater  efforts  to  educate  directors,  market \nparticipants, regulators, and credit agencies are also needed.\nRegarding CDS, reforms should have a number of targets. First, \nCDS contracts should be standardized in order to facilitate trade \ncompression, thereby reducing the size of the net exposure. \nSecond, transactions should be moved onto exchanges run by \ncentralized clearing counterparties (CCPs) in order to increase \ntransparency and reduce counterparty risk. This process has \nstarted. The main question is whether there will be one or \nmultiple markets. It looks as though the US and Europe will \nhave at least one market apiece. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is \nalso developing a CCP, and is looking to establish links between \nits CCP and those in other regions. Even if one single global \nmarket is not feasible, for political and other reasons, markets \nought at least to be consistent and standardized. Third, it is \nnecessary to revive securitization markets, because without \nthem, it will be difficult to see a recovery in credit markets. \nFinally, there have been calls to require banks that securitize \n16 | Unregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation", "debt  to  hold  a  certain  share  of  such  products  in  order  to \nmaintain a degree of risk exposure to such assets. This could be \ncounterproductive, however, as part of the problem leading up to \nthe current financial crisis was that banks were too willing to \nhold such products, and, in fact, should have held less, which \nwould have reduced their losses considerably.\nRegarding hedging strategies involving short-selling of stock to \noffset buying of CDS, some have suggested that such short-\nselling should be banned, and this should be examined further. \nSome countries already have partial or blanket bans on short-\nselling of stocks, and these should also be reviewed.\nHeavy  losses  on  ABS  made  the  greatest  contribution  to \ntriggering  and  worsening  the  financial  crisis,  and  hence \ndeserve to be paid the greatest attention in monitoring and \nregulation activities. As the bulk of ABS were originated in the \nUS,  and  the  remainder  came  largely  from  Europe,  the \nimmediate tasks for regulation and monitoring should fall in \nthose two regions, rather than in Asia, where there was very \nlittle origination of ABS. However, the origination industry \nmay well take hold in Asia in the future, and a regulatory \nframework  is  needed.  This  includes  requirements  for \nmonitoring  of  the  quality  of  underlying  assets  used  as \ncollateral  for  securitization,  requirements  for  disclosure  of \ngreater  information  to  help  value  such  assets,  and \nrequirements  for  disclosure  by  systemically  important \ninstitutions of their holdings of securitized products. Perhaps \nmore relevantly for Asia, there needs to be greater disclosure \nabout the risks inherent in such assets, and regulation of their \nUnregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation | 17", "distribution. This is particularly important for derivative-type \nproducts  that  are  sold  to  individual  investors,  such  as  the \nLehman Brothers\u2019 so-called mini-bonds.\nHeavy  use  of  innovations,  such  as  structured  investment \nvehicles to escape regulations and keep assets off bank balance \nsheets,  contributed  to  the  huge  expansion  of  the  \u201cshadow \nbanking system,\u201d which ended up rivaling regulated banking in \nsize  in  the  US.  This  greatly  reduced  transparency  in  the \nfinancial system and the effective reach of regulators. There \nhave been calls to oblige issuers of complex securities to retain \non their books for the life of the instrument a meaningful \naccount of the underlying risk (non-hedged). However, some \nbanks got into trouble precisely because they kept too many of \nsuch assets on their balance sheets.\nMarket participants frequently resorted to regulatory arbitrage \nor  made  use  of  gaps  in  existing  relations.  Perhaps  most \negregious  was  the  lack  of  supervision  of  the  investment \noperations of insurance companies like AIG. US Federal Reserve \nChairman Ben Bernanke noted, \u201c\u2026the AIG situation highlights \nthe need for strong, effective consolidated supervision of all \nsystemically important financial firms\u201d (Bernanke 2009). There \nneeds to be a thorough review of the regulatory architecture to \nensure that systemically important institutions are monitored \nand regulated in a holistic way, that gaps in regulation are \neliminated, and that opportunities for regulatory arbitrage are \nlimited. This includes reviewing the status of offshore financial \ninstitutions. There also needs to be greater monitoring of hedge \nfunds  and  other  lightly-regulated  institutions,  and  perhaps \n18 | Unregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation", "further  regulation  in  the  case  of  systemically  important \ninstitutions.\nThe Basel II rules for bank capital adequacy clearly failed to \nensure that banks had sufficient capital to deal with the current \nfinancial crisis. There needs to be a general review of where \nguidelines for capital fell short, particularly with regard to \nsystemically important institutions. Capital requirements need \nto take into account overall risk exposure, not just look at \nindividual assets in isolation.\nThe international scope of the crisis, including the activities of \nglobal banks and the worldwide distribution of innovative but \nopaque  financial  products,  highlights  the  need  for  greater \noversight and regulation at the global level. Cooperation among \nnational regulators needs to be strengthened, but, beyond that, \nthere are strong arguments in favor of creating an international \nregulatory authority and international \u201ccolleges\u201d of regulators to \noversee systemically important global financial institutions.\nMore  generally,  the  disastrous  performance  of  financial \ninstitutions as a result of shifting to the originate-to-distribute \nmodel  and  their  reliance  on  complex  securitized  products \nsuggests that there was a failure to educate directors, regulators, \naccountants, and rating agencies about the risks involved in both \nthe model and the products used. Therefore, education efforts in \nthis area clearly need to be improved. It may also be desirable to \nset up a global task force to monitor new financial products.\nFinally, the high reliance on risky securitized assets and off-\nbalance-sheet investment vehicles for bank profitability suggests \nUnregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation | 19", "that there was a broad-based misalignment of incentives, not \nonly in terms of compensation of bank executives, but also for \nregulators  and  credit-rating  agencies.  There  was  too  much \nemphasis on short-term profitability and on the use of risk \nmodels. Credit ratings that were derived from those models \nwere, in hindsight, clearly too optimistic. These issues all need \nto  be  reviewed  as  part  of  a  general  revision  of  the  global \nfinancial  architecture.  Accounting  standards;  risk  analysis \nprocedures\u2014especially those related to \u201cvalue-at-risk\u201d models, \ni.e., model-based estimates of total expected financial losses; and \ncredit rating procedures all failed broadly during this episode, \nand need to be reviewed.\n4.\nConclusion\nHedge funds, private equity funds, and innovative financial \nproducts have each raised significant concerns about financial \nstability and the need for increased surveillance and regulation. \nHedge funds have figured prominently in this regard, due to \ntheir light regulation, lack of disclosure, high leverage, and \nrapid turnover of portfolios. There were often concerns about \nboth direct losses of core institutions on counterparty (trading) \nexposures to hedge funds and indirect losses on banks\u2019 trading \npositions caused by forced liquidation of hedge funds\u2019 positions. \nSince private equity funds have very illiquid portfolios, concerns \nabout them focused on banks\u2019 potential direct losses.\n20 | Unregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation", "However, most assessments of the origins of the current global \nfinancial crisis conclude that highly leveraged funds did not play \na significant role. This is no doubt partly because their leverage \nwas lower than often assumed, typically ranging between one \nand two times their equity capital. It was only the forced selling \nof hedge fund assets due to redemptions that aggravated market \ndeclines later on, and this phenomenon was hardly limited to \nhedge funds. Instead, the main sources of instability were found \nin the highly regulated banking sector, where leverage was \nsometimes far higher. Therefore, most assessments focus on the \nneed to increase surveillance of hedge funds and other lightly \nregulated entities, and to maintain dialogues with major hedge \nfunds,  although  there  are  increased  calls  for  regulation  of \nsystemically important hedge funds.\nConcerns  about  innovative  financial  products,  especially \nderivative products such as credit default swaps and asset-\nbacked  securities,  center  on  the  need  for  standards  in  the \norigination, distribution, and trading of such products, as well as \ntheir capital requirements. In the case of CDS, the market has \nfunctioned more or less as expected, and losses associated with \nmajor credit events such as the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers \nhave turned out to be much smaller than implied by gross \nnotional  exposure  levels.  Proposals  for  reform  center  on \nstandardizing  contracts  to  facilitate  trade  compression  and \nthereby minimize net exposure, and on moving over-the-counter \ntransactions onto standardized exchanges in order to increase \ntransparency. Capital requirements related to such contracts \nalso need to be strengthened.\nUnregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation | 21", "The  problems  are  much  greater  with  ABS,  where  markets \nremain frozen due to uncertainties about valuation and the \nimplications  of  market-clearing  prices  for  bank  capital. \nRegulated banks, with their originate-to-distribute model, lie at \nthe center of the production process for derivative products. A \nresolution of the valuation problem of asset-backed securities is \na prerequisite for restoring the capital adequacy of the bank \nsector  and  restarting  the  lending  process.  Monitoring  and \nregulation of the origination, distribution, and trading of such \nproducts needs to be strengthened, and capital requirements \nneed to be increased.\nThe toxic effects of the combination of the originate-to-distribute \nbanking model and the reliance on sophisticated but opaque \nfinancial  instruments  highlighted  widespread  failures  in \nregulatory coverage, the Basel II capital adequacy standards, \ninternational  regulatory  cooperation,  corporate  governance, \nmanagement incentives, risk management practices, accounting \nstandards, and the behavior of regulators and credit rating \nagencies. These issues all need to be addressed as part of the \nshift to an improved global financial architecture. Regulatory \ngaps need to be closed, including those at the international level, \nand the Basel II capital adequacy rules need to be reviewed and \nstrengthened.  The  education  of  all  participants,  including \ndirectors,  management,  regulators,  accountants,  and  credit \nrating agencies, needs to be strengthened as well.\n22 | Unregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation", "References\nBank for International Settlements. 2008a.

The pool of \nassets is typically a group of small and illiquid assets that are \nunable to be sold individually. Pools of underlying assets can \ninclude common payments from credit cards, auto loans, and \nmortgage  loans,  to  esoteric  cash  flows  from  aircraft  leases, \nroyalty payments, and movie revenues.\nCollateralized  bond  obligation:  A  form  of  securitization \nwhere  payments  from  multiple  investment-grade  corporate \nbonds are pooled together and then subdivided into assets with \ndifferent  risk  characteristics  (tranches),  which  are  sold  to \ndifferent investor groups.\nCollateralized debt obligation (CDO): A security backed by a \npool of assets, mainly non-mortgage loans or bonds, but also \nother asset-backed securities. CDOs are made up of tranches \nwith various maturities and risk characteristics, with the equity \ntranches  carrying  the  most  risk,  and  therefore  paying  the \nhighest interest rate to the buyer. CDOs are basically the same \nas traditional ABS in terms of their structure, but differ from \ntraditional ABS with respect to the type of assets underlying the \ncollateral pool, the motivation for issuance, and the relationship \nbetween the borrower and the special purpose vehicle. CDO \nasset  pools  typically  consist  of  loans  (collateralized  loan \nobligations), higher yield bonds (collateralized bond obligations), \nor a mixture of both. The number of loans typically included is \nmuch  lower  than  in  traditional  ABS  (hundreds  versus \nUnregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation | 25", "thousands), and the types of loans and bonds included can be \nmuch more diverse than in traditional ABS.\nCollateralized loan obligation: A form of securitization where \npayments from multiple middle-sized and large business loans \nare pooled together and passed on to different classes of owners \nin various tranches.\nCommercial mortgage-backed security: A security backed \nby one or more pools of mortgage loans secured by commercial \n(non-residential) properties.\nCovenant-lite loan: A loan whose main terms have fewer or no \nmaintenance covenants. A covenant-lite loan does not include \nthe legal clauses which allow a lender to control and track the \nperformance of a company and, if need be, declare a default if \ncertain criteria are breached. With covenant-lite loans, a bank \ncan only act if a borrower attempts to take specific actions, such \nas adding more debt or making an acquisition. More-traditional \nmaintenance covenants allow banks to step in at any point if a \nborrower\u2019s performance drops below a certain benchmark.\nCredit derivative: A contract between two parties which uses a \nderivative to transfer credit risk from one party to another, in \nexchange for a fee.\nCredit default swap (CDS): A bilateral financial contract in \nwhich the protection buyer (risk shedder) pays a fixed periodic \nfee in return for a contingent payment by the protection seller \n(risk taker), which is triggered by a credit event of a specified \nfirm  or  entity.  Credit  events,  which  are  specified  in  CDS \ncontracts, may include bankruptcy, default, or restructuring.\n26 | Unregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation", "Credit default swap spread: This spread signals the market\u2019s \nview on a specified firm or entity\u2019s likeliness to experience a \ncredit event that would trigger a contingent payment. The CDS \nspread is the premium paid by the protection buyer (expressed \nas basis points per annum of the notional amount of the CDS \ncontract). A CDS spread of 500 basis points means that the \nannual  cost  of  protection  with  respect  to  US$1  million  of \nspecified underlying debt is US$50,000.\nGross nominal value or gross notional value: Nominal or \nnotional amounts outstanding are defined as the gross nominal \nor notional value of all deals concluded and not yet settled at the \nreporting date. The notional value to be reported is that of the \nmaximum default protection specified in the contract itself and \nnot  the  par  value  of  financial  instruments  intended  to  be \ndelivered.\nMortgage-backed security: A security backed by a pool of \nmortgage  loans  secured  on  real  property.  Investors  receive \npayments  of  interest  and  principle  derived  from  payments \nreceived on the underlying mortgage loans.\nMacro-prudential framework: A framework for preserving \nfinancial  stability  that  looks  not  just  at  the  soundness  of \nindividual  institutions,  but  also  takes  into  account  the \ninteractions among various financial markets and institutions as \npossible sources of systemic risk. In other words, the risk to \nfinancial stability of the system as a whole may be greater than \nthe sum of the risks to individual institutions.\nUnregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation | 27", "Net notional value: Net notional balances, as opposed to gross \nbalances, cancel out transactions that offset each other. For \ninstance, if an investment bank buys US$100 million in credit-\ndefault swaps to protect against a company default and sells \nUS$50 million of swaps for protection on the same company, the \nnet notional value would be US$50 million. The International \nSwaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) estimates that the \nnet notional value, which is the amount at risk in the CDS \nmarketplace, is only 3% of the gross notional value.\nOriginate-to-distribute model: A business model for banks \nwhereby  banks  make  loans,  but  then  package  them  into \nsecurities in order to sell them, thereby removing them from \ntheir balance sheets. Having a smaller balance sheet enables \nbanks to reduce their capital requirements.\nProcyclicality:  The  tendency  of  financial  regulations  to \nexacerbate the volatility of economic swings. For example, when \nthe economy turns down, banks\u2019 capital declines, which forces \nthem  to  reduce  lending  to  maintain  their  capital  adequacy \nratios. However, this, in turn, puts further downward pressure \non the economy, leading to further declines in banks\u2019 capital.\nResidential mortgage-backed security: A security backed by \na  homogeneous  pool  of  mortgage  loans  secured  on  real \nresidential property.\nSecond lien loan: A form of loan with a security interest in the \nassets  of  a  company  that  is  second  in  ranking  behind  a \ntraditional senior credit facility. The second lien lender will \ntypically  be  required  to  agree  contractually  (through  an \n28 | Unregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation", "intercreditor agreement or other contract) to subordinate its \nclaims on the assets to the first lien secured lenders.\nSpecial purpose vehicle (SPV) or Special purpose entity \n(SPE): \u201cA special purpose vehicle (SPV) or special purpose \nentity (SPE) is a company that is created solely for a particular \nfinancial transaction or series of transactions. It may sometimes \nbe something other than a company, such as a trust. The SPV\u2019s \ndebts may, or may not, be raised with recourse to the \u201creal\u201d \nborrower. SPVs/SPEs are often used to make a transaction tax \nefficient by choosing the most favourable tax residence for the \nvehicle. This is commonly done with eurobonds so that foreign \ninvestors do not have to pay withholding taxes in the borrower\u2019s \ncountry of residence.\u201d (Pietersz 2006\u20132009)\nStructured investment vehicle: A type of SPE that funds the \npurchase of its assets (mainly highly-rated securities) through \nthe issuance of both commercial-paper and medium-term notes. \nStructured  investment  vehicles  are  offshore  entities,  and \ntherefore  escape  the  regulations  that  banks  and  finance \ncompanies are subject to.\nTrade  compression:  A  process  that  involves  terminating \nexisting trades and replacing them with a smaller number of \nnew \u201creplacement trades,\u201d which have the same risk profile and \ncash flows as the initial portfolio, but less capital exposure.\nUnregulated Entities, Products, and Markets: Challenges for Monitoring and Regulation | 29", "Research Policy Brief 30\nAbout this Research Policy Brief\nThe implications for financial stability of lightly regulated and highly \nleveraged financial institutions such as hedge funds and private equity \nfunds, together with innovative financial products such as derivatives \nand asset-backed securities, remain a subject of controversy, especially \nin the current global financial crisis, where issues of systemic risk have \nnot only national, but regional and global implications.
