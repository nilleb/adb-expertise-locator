INTRODUCTION \n\nM. Llorca \n\nSince  the  1980s,  most  Asian  countries  have  pursued  processes  for  economic \nliberalization at the internal and external levels (openness to foreign trade and capital \nflows).  The  implementation  of  such  programs  especially  implies  that  governments \ncarry  out  a  substantial  stabilization  of  their  external  deficits.  The  main  objective  of \nthese measures is for external deficit to become sustainable in the long run in order to \navoid the negative consequences of large external deficits and debt crises. \n\nAs the issue of public debt sustainability has gained in importance in Asia (as reflected \nin  a  book  by  Ferrarini,  Ramayandi,  and  Jha  [2012]  on  this  topic),  external  debt \nsustainability  has  become  important  too,  following  the  1997  financial  Asian  crisis  and \nthe  2008\u20132009  global  financial  and  economic  crisis.  External  debt  sustainability  is  a \nrelevant  topic  in  the  region  for  several  reasons:  (i)  to  maintain  foreign  investor \nconfidence  in  the  economy;  (ii)  to  address  the  adverse  effects1 on  the  external  debt \nposition;  (iii)  to  prevent  a  debt  crisis;  and  (iv)  because  of  the  current  high  level  of \nuncertainty  in  this  period  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China's  (PRC)  \u201csoft  landing\u201d \ngrowth,  which  is  inducing  a  decline  in  some  commodity  prices  and  a  decline  in \ninternational trade flows between Asian countries. \n\nAs  a  result,  we  explore  the  external  debt  sustainability  issue  by  employing  a  panel \napproach on 24 Asian emerging and developing countries over the period 1993\u20132014. \nA  panel  approach  is  appropriate  given  the  strong  economic,  trade,  and  finance  links \namong the economies of the region. The interests of this study are many and varied.  \nFirst, we consider a total panel of 24 emerging and developing Asian countries,2 which \nhas never been used in the literature, and we divide this sample into four sub-panels, \nnamely Southeast Asia, Southwest Asia, Central Asia, and the Pacific (corresponding \nto the country classifications made for instance by the International Monetary Fund or \nthe  World  Bank).  Second,  we  take  into  account  a  recent  period,  1993\u20132014,  which \nincludes the impacts of the 1997 Asian crisis and the 2008\u20132009 global financial crisis \non  external  debt  sustainability  over  the  four  sub-panels.  Third,  to  test  the  external \nsustainability,  we  employ  both  first  and  the  second  generation  panel  unit  root  and \ncointegration tests to take into account cross-sectional dependence among countries. \n\nIn  these  conditions,  we  use  the  present-value  methodology  to  determine  whether  \nthe country satisfies its intertemporal external constraint, namely whether the external \ndebt  is  sustainable  in  the  long  run.  Such  a  methodology  requires  studying  the  \npanel  stationarity  of  external  debt,  the  current  account,  imports,  and  exports,  and  the \ncointegration between these two last variables.  \n\nTo  our  knowledge,  no  paper  has  tackled  the  issue  of  external  debt  sustainability  in \nthese  24  emerging  and  developing  Asian  countries  by  applying  recent  econometric \nmethods for panel data. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1   Such as a sudden currency depreciation, which increases the amount of external debt denominated in \n\nforeign currency, or a rise in external debt interest rates. \n\n2   The  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  Mongolia;  Southeast  Asia  (Indonesia,  Malaysia,  the  Philippines, \nThailand, and Viet Nam); Southwest Asia (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka); \nCentral  Asia  (Armenia,  Azerbaijan,  Georgia,  Kazakhstan,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  Tajikistan);  the \nPacific (Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Tonga). The case of Asian developed \ncountries, such as Japan, Singapore, and the Republic of Korea, is not considered in this study. \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 692 \n \n\nM. Llorca \n\nThe  outline  of  this  article  is  as  follows:  Section  2  presents  a  brief  survey  of  the \nexternal debt sustainability literature. Section 3 outlines the intertemporal approach \nto  the  current  account.  Section  4  provides  a  description  of  the  data  and  reports  the \neconometric  findings.  Section  5  analyzes  the  vulnerabilities,  factors,  and  risks  in  the \nregion by using different external debt indicators, such as the debt service, the share of \nthe short-term external debt, the amount of total reserves, or again the debt currency \ncomposition.  Finally,  we  conclude  this  study  by  establishing  different  prospective \nscenarios on the Asian emerging and developing countries according to the degree of \nthe PRC economic slowdown (a \u201csoft\u201d or \u201chard\u201d landing). \n\n2.  SURVEY OF THE EXTERNAL DEBT  \nSUSTAINABILITY LITERATURE  \n\nThe  basic  issue  concerning  the  sustainability  of  external  deficits  has  gained \nimportance  in  developing  countries  as  well  as  among  political  leaders,  academic \neconomists,  and  researchers  in  international  institutions.  Indeed,  debt  sustainability \nhas become a highly important topic for governments because it requires the adoption \nof responsible policies in order to assure macroeconomic stability.  \n\nAs  a  result,  extensive  theoretical  and  empirical  literature  has  emerged  on  this  \ntopic  since  the  1990s.  In  most  cases,  time-series  methods  have  been  employed  to \nexamine  whether  the  external  deficit  of  a  nation  is  effectively  consistent  with  its \nintertemporal  external  constraint  in  present-value  terms.  Moreover,  most  of  the \nempirical studies have focused on the United States and other industrial countries: the \nUnited  States  (Trehan  and  Walsh  1991;  Husted  1992;  Wickens  and  Uctum  1993; \nAhmed  and  Rogers  1995;  Fisher  1995;  Hakkio  1995;  Leachman  and  Francis  2000; \nTakeushi  2010;  Christopoulos  and  Leon-Ledesma  2010),  the  United  States  and \nCanada  (Otto  1992;  Wu,  Fountas,  and  Chen  1996),  and  the  G7  countries  (Liu  and \nTanner  1996).  The  results  of  these  studies  generally  reveal  that  external  deficits  \nare  not  sustainable  for  several  major  developed  countries.  However,  relatively  few \npapers (Sawada 1994; Coakley and Kulasi 1997; F\u00e8ve and Henin 1998; Pattichis and \nKanaan  2001;  Jha  2003;  Lau  and  Baharumshah  2003;  Sun  2004;  Berthomieu  et  al. \n2004; \u00d6nel and Uctulu 2006; Yilanci and \u00d6zcan 2008; Kim et al. 2009; Boengiu et al. \n2011)  have  applied  similar  econometric  tests  to  assess  the  sustainability  of  external \ndeficits  in  developing  countries.  In  short,  the  findings  established  by  these  studies \nsuggest  that  external  sustainability  conditions  are  hard  to  meet  in  a  number  of \ndeveloping countries. \n\nRecently,  some  papers  have  investigated  the  issue  of  external  sustainability  by \nadopting unit-root and/or cointegration tests for panel data. We can quote the work of \nWu  (2000)  and  Wu,  Chen,  and  Lee  (2001)  studying  current  account  sustainability \namong  industrial  countries.  In  addition,  applying  an  augmented  Dickey-Fuller  panel \ndata  unit-root  test  within  a  seemingly  unrelated  regression,  Holmes  (2006)  finds  that \nexternal debt is sustainable for at least 12 Latin American countries. Ehrhart and Llorca \n(2007)  focus  on  a  panel  of  seven  South  Mediterranean  countries  and  use  first \ngeneration  panel  unit-root  tests  (Im,  Pesaran,  and  Shin  2003;  Maddala  and  Wu  \n1999;  Choi  2001)  and  of  cointegration  tests  (Predoni1999).  Nasir  and  Noman  (2012) \napply  a  two-step  nonlinear  framework  to  investigate  the  stationary  property  of  the  \ndebt-to-external  earnings  ratio  for  36  countries  and  the  current  account-to-gross \nnational  income  ratio  for  55  countries.  Another  method  was  developed  on  a  panel  of \n19 Asian countries from 1981 to 2010 by studying the mean-reverting behavior of the \nexternal  debt  (Lau,  Baharumshah,  and  Soon  2013).  Finally,  Lin  (2014)  examines  \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 692 \n \n\nM. Llorca \n\nthe  sustainability  of  external  debt  for  21  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and \nDevelopment countries by using a quantile regression model. \n\n3.  THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK:  \n\nTHE INTERTEMPORAL APPROACH  \nTO THE CURRENT ACCOUNT \n\nEconometric tests of current account sustainability consist of investigating whether the \ncountry satisfies its intertemporal external constraint. In other words, empirical studies \nabout this issue are based on the intertemporal approach to the current account. \n\nHusted (1992) provides a simple small-economy framework  in which a representative \nhousehold is able to borrow and lend freely in international financial markets at a given \nworld rate of interest.  \n\nThe representative agent faces the following current period budget constraint: \n\nC\n0\n\n=\n\nY\n0\n\n+\n\nB\n0\n\n\u2212\n\nI\n\n0\n\n(\n\u2212 +\n1\n\n)\nr B\u2212\n0\n1\n\n \n\nwhere C0, Y0, B0, and I0 represent current consumption, output, international borrowing, \nand investment; r0 is the one-period world interest rate; and (1+ r0) B-1 is the initial debt \nof the representative agent, corresponding to the country\u2019s external debt.  \n\nEquation (1) must hold for every time period. Iterating (1) forward yields the economy\u2019s \nintertemporal budget constraint (see Husted [1992: 160]): \n\nB\n0\n\n=\n\nTB\u03b4\nt\nt\n\n+\n\n\u03b4\nlim  B\nn\n\u2192\u221e\nn\n\nn\n\n \n\n\u221e\n\n\u2211\n\nt\n\n=\n1\n\nt\n\nt\n\nt\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n=\n\nTB\nt\n\n=\nX M Y C I\n\n\u2212  represents  the  trade  balance  in  period  t,  Xt  equals \n\nwhere \nt\nthe exports, Mt is the imports, and \u03b4t is the discount factor. \nA  necessary  and  sufficient  condition  for  external  sustainability  is  that  as  n \u2192 \u221e ,  \nthe  discounted  value  of  the  external  debt  converges  asymptotically  to  zero.  This \ntransversality condition can be expressed as \n\n \n\nt\n\nlim\n\u2192\u221e\nn\n\nB\u03b4\nn\nn\n\n=  \n0\n\nEquation  (3)  implies  that  a  country  cannot  borrow  (lend)  indefinitely  in  global  capital \nmarkets  to  finance  its  trade  account  deficit  (surplus).  If  this  transversality  condition \nholds,  then  the  amount  of  country  borrows  (lends)  in  international  financial  markets \nequals the present-value of the future trade surplus (deficits). \n\nAfter several manipulations, we finally get a testable equation: \n\n (1) \n\n (2) \n\n(3) \n\n(4) \n\n\u2212\nM X\nt\n\nt\n\n=\n\n\u2212\n1\n\nj\n\u03bb\n\n\u2206\n\nX\n\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\n\n+\n\nt\n\nj\n\n\u2212 \u2206\n\nZ\n\n+\n\nt\n\nj\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n\n  \n\n\u221e\n\n\u2211\n\nj\n\n=\n\n0\n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 692 \n \n\nM. Llorca \n\nGiven the right-hand variables from equation (4) are first-difference stationary, the left-\nhand  side  of  equation  (4)  must  be  stationary  in  order  to  satisfy  the  present-value \nexternal constraint. Thus, Mt and Xt must be examined for stationarity. If Mt and Xt are \nI(1), then they must be cointegrated so that the left-hand side of equation (7), i.e., the \ncurrent account deficit, is stationary. \n\nThus, a test for the sustainability of the external debt can check for the cointegration of \nthese two variables, Mt and Xt, if they are I(1). This cointegration regression takes the \nfollowing form: \n\nXt = a + bMt + ut \n\n(5) \n\nFormally,  if  Mt  and  Xt  are  I(1),  the  null  hypothesis  is  that  Mt  and  Xt  are  cointegrated  \nand  \u03b2  =  1.  If  the  null  hypothesis  is  not  rejected,  then  the  external  debt  is  said  to  \nbe sustainable. \n\n4.  EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION \n\n4.1  Sample and Data \n\nThe sustainability of external debt is assessed in a sample of 24 Asian emerging and \ndeveloping  countries. 3 We  use  annual  data  collected  from  the  World  Bank\u2019s  World \nDevelopment  Indicators.  The  sample  covers  the  period  1993\u20132014  for  the  current \naccount, external debt, imports, and exports variables. The current account balance is \nthe  sum  of  the  net  exports  of  goods,  services,  net  income,  and  net  current  transfers. \nExternal debt is the debt owed to non-residents, repayable in foreign currency, goods, \nor  services.  Our  measure  of  exports  includes  the  exports  of  goods  and  services.  Our \nmeasure of imports only comprises the imports of goods and services since the data on \nnet  transfer  payments  and  net  interest  payments  are  not  available.  All  variables  are \nmeasured in terms of their ratio to nominal GDP.  \n\n4.2  Features of the External Position of Asian Emerging  \n\nand Developing Countries \n\nFirst,  we  notice  that  external  debt  has  fallen  slightly  over  the  last  2  decades  in  the \nglobal  panel  of  24  emerging  and  developing  Asian  countries  (see  Table  1  and \nFigure 1).  However,  we  can  see  different  paths  according  to  the  sub-panel  group:  a \nstrong decrease by more than half of the external debt in Southeast Asia, a decline of \n10 percentage points of GDP in Southwest Asia, and a slight decrease in the Pacific; \nmeanwhile, the external debt-to-GDP ratio shows an increase by 20 percentage points \nin Central Asia.  \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n3   However, data for exports and imports in the cases of Papua New Guinea and Samoa are missing, so \nwe  do  not  include  these  two  countries  in  the  study  of  the  cointegration  relationship,  and  we  cannot \nconstitute the Pacific panel for this step. \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 692 \n \n\nM. Llorca \n\nFigure 1: External Debt Evolution in Emerging and Developing Asian Countries \n(% of GDP) \n\nSource: World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators. \n\n \n\nSpecifically, if we consider the external debt evolution by country (Appendix, Table A.1, \nwe notice that four countries (the PRC, India, Azerbaijan, and Fiji) have a low level of \nexternal  debt  (less  than  20%  of  GDP),  whereas  seven  nations  (Mongolia,  Bhutan, \nArmenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Papua New Guinea, namely \nfour countries from Central Asia) have a high level of external debt (more than 60% of \nGDP).  Thus,  in  the  four  countries  from  Central  Asia,  external  debt  grew  sharply  from \n2000  to  2014,  whereas  all  the  other  countries  in  the  panel  reduced  their  external \nindebtedness over these 2 decades, sometimes at a sustained pace (by more than 20 \npercentage  points  of  GDP  for  the  Philippines,  Bangladesh,  Tajikistan,  Samoa,  and \nSolomon Islands; by more than 30 percentage points of GDP for Indonesia, Thailand, \nand Nepal; and even by more than 70 points of GDP for Viet Nam). \n\nTable 1: External Debt Evolution in Asian Emerging and Developing Countries \n(% of GDP) \n\nPanel \n\nSoutheast Asia \nSouthwest Asia \nCentral Asia \nPacific  \nGlobal panel \n\n1993\u20131999 \n55.5 \n40.2 \n33.7 \n42.5 \n41.0 \n\n2000\u20132007 \n39.8 \n39.8 \n49.3 \n35.4 \n40.3 \n\n2008\u20132014 \n25.3 \n31.7 \n52.4 \n38.7 \n38.3 \n\nAverage \n40.2 \n37.3 \n45.3 \n38.7 \n39.9 \n\nSource: Author\u2019s calculations from the World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators. \n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 692 \n \n\nM.

Similarly,  some  Central  Asian  countries  (Georgia,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and \nArmenia), and Bhutan and Mongolia have a current account deficit higher than 10% of \nGDP  between  2008  and  2014.  Meanwhile,  among  countries  accumulating  current \naccount  surpluses,  we  have  Azerbaijan  (with  a  surplus  of  more  than  20%  of  GDP \nduring  the  last  period),  Malaysia  (with  a  surplus  of  around  10%  of  GDP  on  average \nsince 2000), and the PRC, the Philippines, and Thailand with surpluses higher than 3% \nof GDP during the last period.  \n\nFinally,  according  to  the  global  panel,  exports  and  imports  (Appendix  C)  have \nincreased  gradually  with  a  higher  increase  in  Southeast  Asia  than  in  Southwest  Asia \nand Central Asia (and even a slight decrease for imports in the latter sub-panel). \n\n4.3  Empirical Results \n\nMost  empirical \nthe  observed \ntests  of  external  sustainability  study  whether \ncharacteristics  of  the  external  debt-related  variables  satisfy  the  solvency  condition  in \nequation  (3).  As  in  time  series  studies,  in  the  case  of  panel  data  analysis,  the \neconometric  methodology  employed  to  test  this  solvency  condition  consists  mainly  of \ntwo steps.  \n\nIn the first step, the stationary properties of the  current account, exports, imports and \nstock  of  external  debt  are  studied  using  unit-root  tests  for  panel  data.  External  debt \nsustainability requires that these external variables be integrated of order zero. \n\nIf  imports  and  exports  are  found  to  be  integrated  of  order  one  (non-stationary),  it  is \nimportant to investigate in a second step whether there is a cointegration  relationship \nbetween  imports  and  exports.  Cointegration  among  these  variables  is  a  necessary \ncondition for external sustainability. \n\n4.3.1  Unit Root Results \n\nThe  unit  root  tests  can  be  classified  into  two  groups,  depending  on  whether  they \naccount  for  cross-sectional  dependence  or  not.  The  first  generation  panel  unit  root \ntests  (Im,  Pesaran,  and  Shin  2003;  Maddala  and  Wu  1999;  Choi  2001)  have  been \ncriticized  because  they  assume  cross-sectional  independence.  This  hypothesis  is \nrather  restrictive  and  unrealistic  since  macroeconomic  time  series  exhibit  significant \ncross-sectional  correlation  among  countries  in  a  panel  (Baltagi  2008),  and  co-\nmovements  of  economies  are  often  observed  in  the  majority  of  macroeconomic \napplications  of  unit  root  tests  (Hurlin  and  Mignon  2005).  The  presence  of  cross-\nsectional correlation of errors in panel data applications in economics is likely to be the \nrule  rather  than  the  exception  (Chudik  and  Pesaran  2015).  Moreover,  correlation \nacross  units  in  panels  may  have  significant  consequences  on  the  first  generation  of \ntests  assuming  cross-sectional  independence.  When  applied  to  cross-sectionally \ndependent panels, such panel unit root tests can generate substantial size distortions \n(O\u2019Connell  1998).  As  a  result,  alternative  (second  generation)  panel  unit  root  tests  \n(Bai and Ng 2004; Chang 2002, 2004; Choi 2002; Moon and Perron 2004; Phillips and \nSul  2003;  Pesaran  2007)  have  been  proposed  to  take  into  account  cross-sectional \ndependence. \n\nThe results of the Pesaran test of cross-sectional dependence are shown in Table 3.  \n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 692 \n \n\nM.

Second,  the  CD  test  strongly  rejects  the  null \nhypothesis  of  cross-sectional  independence  in  Southeast  Asia  and  Southwest  Asia, \nsuggesting  the  presence  of  cross-sectional  dependence  in  these  two  sub-panels.  To \nstudy the issue of external sustainability, it is necessary to employ second generation \npanel  unit  root  tests  (Pesaran  2007)  allowing  for  this  cross-country  dependence  in \nSoutheast Asia and Southwest Asia. Finally, we propose to use both first and second \ngeneration unit root tests for the global panel and for Central Asia because the CD test \nreveals  opposite  results  between  the  variables  of  external  debt-current  account  and \nexports-imports. \n\nAs  shown  in  Table  4  (see  also  Appendix,  Tables  5  and  6),  the  panel  unit  root  tests \nindicate  that  for  the  global  panel  and  Central  Asia,  the  current  account  and  external \ndebt  variables  are  stationary  in  level  (or  integrated  of  order  0),  according  to  the  \nfirst  generation  test,  which  is  a  condition  necessary  (but  insufficient)  for  external \nsustainability.  However,  for  the  sub-panels,  Southwest  Asia  and  the  Pacific, 4  the \ncurrent account and external debt variables are stationary in first difference (integrated \nof  order  1).  In  addition,  imports  and  exports  are  integrated  of  the  same  order  in  the \nglobal  panel  and  for  Southeast  Asia,  Southwest  Asia,  and  Central  Asia,  so  we  can \nproceed  to  the  next  step  in  the  study  of  external  sustainability,  namely  the  panel \ncointegration tests. \n\n                                                 \n4   However, we cannot say that external debt is not sustainable in this region because we cannot proceed \nto the cointegration tests between imports and exports due to missing data on these variables for Papua \nNew Guinea and Samoa. \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 692 \n \n\nM.

Westerlund\u2019s  test \n(2007) takes into account the presence of cross-sectional dependence. \n\n\u03c1\n\ntests, all the tests indicate \nExcept for the panel variance test and the group and panel\na rejection of the null hypothesis of no cointegration between export and import ratios \nat  the  1%  significance  level  for  the  two  panels.  However,  Monte  Carlo  simulations \ncarried  out  by  Pedroni  (2004)  show  that  in  short  samples  (T=22,  in  our  case),  panel  \nt-statistics and group t-statistics generally perform best, followed by panel \u03c1 statistics. \nPanel-v  and  group \u03c1  statistics  perform  worst  in  this  specific  case.  According  to  these \nresults,  we  can  conclude  that  the  null  hypothesis  of  no  cointegration  between  export \nand  import  ratios  is  rejected.  The  findings  imply  that  in  a  panel  perspective,  external \ndebt is sustainable in the long run in the global panel and in the sub-panel for Central \nAsia.  Moreover,  using  the  Westerlund  panel  cointegration  tests  (second  generation \npanel unit root tests) for the global panel, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and Southwest \nAsia, all the panel tests reject the null hypothesis, so external debt is sustainable, too, \nin these four panels.  \n\n9 \n \n\n\fGlobal panel \n\nCentral Asia \n\nStatistics \n \n \n\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udf0f\n \n\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udefc\n \n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udf0f\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udefc\n\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udf0f and G\u03b1\nSource: Author. \n\nADBI Working Paper 692 \n \n\nM.

VULNERABILITY FACTORS AND RISKS IN ASIAN \nEMERGING AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES:  \nA PROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS \n\nFollowing this analysis of the external debt in Asian emerging and developing countries \nover the past 2 decades, it is relevant, too, to consider the future path of the external \ndebt.  We  propose  analyzing  the  vulnerabilities,  factors,  and  risks  associated  with  the \nexternal debt of Asian countries. \n\nThus, four external debt criteria must be taken into account to assess the risk of future \nfinancial  turmoil  on  the  external  debt  of  an  Asian  country:  the  debt  currency \ncomposition,  the  share  of  the  short-term  external  debt,  the  debt  service,  and  the \namount of total reserves. \n\nThe  first  external  vulnerability  factor  is  the  debt  currency  composition.  Indeed,  since \nMay  2014  and  the  appreciation  of  the  US  dollar  against  Asian  currencies,  exchange \nrate movements have increased the external debt burden denominated  in US dollars. \nThis is notably the case for Central Asian countries (such as the Kyrgyz Republic and \nTajikistan)  or  even  India,  Indonesia,  Thailand,  and  the  Philippines,  which  have  high \nexposure  to  the  appreciation  of  the  US  dollar  against  their  local  currencies.  On  the \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 692 \n \n\nM. Llorca \n\ncontrary,  countries  indebted  in  a  foreign  currency  that  depreciates  against  their  local \ncurrencies can benefit from a decrease in their external debt burden. This is the case \nfor  Kazakhstan  and  Georgia,  which  are  massively  indebted  in  pounds  sterling  \n(by, respectively, 96% and 70% of their external debt). Indeed, they benefitted from the \ndepreciation  of  the  pound  sterling  since  the  United  Kingdom\u2019s  Brexit  decision  on \n23 June 2016. \n\nThe  share  of  short-term  external  debt  can  constitute  a  second  factor  for  external \nvulnerability  in  times  of  tension  on  external  debt.  However,  all  the  emerging  and \ndeveloping Asian countries have low levels of short-term external debt as a percentage \nof their total external debt, except for Thailand and Malaysia with around 40%\u201350% of \nshort-term external debt and the PRC with more than 70%. \n\nThe  third  criterion  is  the  level  of  debt  service,  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  export \nrevenue.  Indeed,  we  can  notice  that  some  Asian  developing  and  emerging  countries \nare  constrained  by  their  debt  service,  reaching more  than  20%  of  exports  in  2014  for \nPakistan,  Indonesia,  and  Georgia  and  even  more  than  30%  in  Armenia,  Kazakhstan, \nand Tajikistan. On the other hand, countries such as  the PRC, Viet Nam, Azerbaijan, \nBangladesh,  Thailand,  Malaysia,  and  the  Philippines  have  higher  margins  (or  space) \ndue to low debt servicing and their high levels of exports revenue.  \n\nFinally,  the  last  indicator  to  focus  on  is  the  amount  of  total  reserves,  expressed  as  a \npercentage  of  total  external  debt  or  in  months  of  imports.  On  the  one  hand,  some \ncountries are well protected against external adverse events (such as financial crises in \nthe  region).  These  include  the  PRC,  Azerbaijan,  Thailand,  the  Philippines,  Bhutan, \nBangladesh, and India due to their high levels of reserves accumulated since 2000. On \nthe other hand, Central Asian countries, with the exception of Azerbaijan, have a weak \nposition. A notable example is Tajikistan with a very low amount of reserves in months \nof imports.  \n\nAccording to these four external debt criteria (Appendix, Table A.7), we can expect an \nimportant  threat  to  the  future  path  of  the  external  debt  of  Central  Asian  countries \n(except Azerbaijan), notably for Tajikistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and, to a lesser extent, \nGeorgia. In addition, with the decline in the commodity prices over the current period, \nthe Central Asian countries cannot accumulate enough reserves to face a future crisis. \nHowever, the external debt prospects are better in Southeast Asia and Southwest Asia, \nwhere countries have important reserves at their disposal to act as shock absorbers in \nthe case of a crisis. \n\nAs a result, in this time of uncertainty in the world and in the region, we must consider \ntwo alternative scenarios in Asia and their consequences on the external debt position \nof Asian countries.5  \n\nThe first optimistic scenario is based on a PRC \u201csoft landing\u201d (with a growth of around \n6%\u20136.5%) with a stabilization at the current level of the oil Brent price ($ 50 per barrel). \nIn  this  context,  countries  that  are  most  integrated  with  the  PRC,  through  international \ntrade  channels,  will  register  a  decrease  in  their  exports  to  the  PRC  and  so  will  have \nless  export  revenue  to  finance  their  external  debt.  Similarly,  we  can  expect  that  the \nPRC will reduce its foreign direct investment flows to Asian countries, resulting in less \nincome to finance external deficits. In such a situation, Southeast Asian countries, such \nas  Thailand,  will  be  the  most  affected.  However,  because  of  their  levels  of  reserves \naccumulated over the past years, there is no worry about the financing of their external \n\n                                                 \n5   These uncertainties include the PRC\u2019s economic slowdown, movements in commodity prices, volatility \nof  financial  markets  and  exchange  rates,  the  gradual  increase  of  the  Federal  Reserve  rate,  the \nappreciation of the US dollar, and other external events such as the Brexit decision or political risks. \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 692 \n \n\nM. Llorca \n\nposition.  Even  in  the  case  of  a  strong  appreciation  of  the  US  dollar  (induced  by  the \nfuture  increase  of  the  Federal  Reserve  rate,  for  instance),  the  external  debt  burden \ndenominated  in  US  dollars  will  increase.  Moreover,  Asian  countries  that  produce \ncommodities, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and some Central Asian countries, will be \naffected  negatively  by  the  current  commodity  cycle  and  be  unable  to  accumulate \nenough  reserves  for  the  future.  The  situation  for  Central  Asian  countries  (except \nAzerbaijan)  is  even  more  troubling,  particularly  for  Kazakhstan,  because  of  their \nexternal debt situations and their trade and financial integration with the PRC through \nthe  new  \u201cSilk  Road.\u201d  Indeed,  the  PRC  slowdown  could  report  in  the  future  some \nprojects  or  financing  of  this  development  strategy  affecting  Kazakhstan  and  their \nexternal account.  \n\nThe second scenario is based on a \u201chard landing\u201d for the PRC (with a growth rate less \nthan  5%),  resulting  notably  from  the  high  level  of  PRC  domestic  private  debt  and  the \nincrease  of  non-performing  loans  affecting  the  PRC\u2019s  banking  and  shadow  banking \nsector.  In  this  worst-case  scenario,  the  entire  region  will  be  affected  through \ninternational  trade  and  finance  channels.  In  this  period  of  financial  stress,  we  can \nexpect  outflows  of  portfolio  investment  and  foreign  direct  investment  so  that  the \nweakest  countries  in  terms  of  reserves  must  use  their  reserves  to  face  the  external \ncrisis. Moreover, a \u201chard landing\u201d for the PRC would induce a slowdown in the use of \nits  raw  materials,  and  so  commodity  prices  would  decline,  affecting  countries  that \nproduce natural resources more severely.  \n\nAmid  a  financing  \u201ccrunch\u201d,  Asian  countries  can  use  their  accumulated  reserves  \nfrom  the  last  decade  to  face  the  economic  and  financial  shocks.  However,  countries \nwith  insufficient  levels  of  reserves\u2014such  as  the  Central  Asian  countries,  Pakistan, \nSri Lanka,  or  even  Viet  Nam\u2014will  be  affected  by  a  negative  dynamic  to  finance  their \nexternal deficits and debt.  \n\n6.  CONCLUSION  \n\nIn this study, we conducted a formal test of whether the external debt in 24 emerging \nand  developing  Asian  countries  is  sustainable  in  the  long  run.  We  performed  recent \npanel  unit-root  and  cointegration  tests  for  panel  data  for  the  period  1993\u20132014  to \nexamine  whether  the  external  positions  have  been  coherent  with  their  inter-temporal \nexternal constraints. Moreover, we divided our sample into four sub-panels\u2014Southeast \nAsia, Southwest Asia, Central Asia, and the Pacific\u2014to identify specific external trade \nand debt trends.  \n\nWe find that over the last 2 decades, external debt has been sustainable in the region \nand  in  the  sub-panels  considered.  The  economic  implication  of  this  result  is  that \nimports  and  exports  move  together  in  the  long  run.  Moreover,  Southeast  Asian  and \nSouthwest  Asian  countries  benefited  from  their  export  revenues  during  the  2000s  to \naccumulate reserves that can be used in the future to buffer strong external shocks.  \n\nAs  a  result,  by  taking  into  account  four  criteria  of  external  vulnerabilities  (the  debt \ncurrency composition, share of short-term debt, debt service, and amount of reserves), \nthe external debt position in emerging and developing Asian countries is not worrying, \ncontrary  to  the  current  external  positions  of  some  African  (Angola,  Mozambique, \nGhana, Congo) or Latin American countries (Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina). However, it \nis  important  to  be  vigilant  and  monitor  the  external  situation  of  some  Central  Asian \ncountries (Tajikistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Kazakhstan) due to the deterioration of their \nexternal deficits in the recent period of declining oil prices and the appreciation of the \nUS dollar against their local currencies. \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 692 \n \n\nM. Llorca \n\nFinally, with the current changing cycle of commodities prices, it is important for Asian \ncountries that produce commodities to diversify their economic structure and avoid the \nDutch disease prophecy6. Similarly, Asian countries that are closely integrated with the \nPRC  must  diversify  their  international  trade  relationships  with  trading  partners,  such  \nas India. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n6   Such  mechanism  was  used  to  describe  the  economic  situation  of  the  Netherlands  during  the  1960s \nwhen they discovered gas fields in the North Sea. It is defined as the negative effects resulting from an \nincrease in important commodities export in a country. \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 692 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nM.

According to such methodology, we study the panel stationarity of external debt, current \naccount, imports, and exports, then the cointegration between these two last variables. We \nemploy  unit  root  and  cointegration  tests,  the  first  and  second  generation  tests,  to  take  into \naccount cross-sectional dependence. Our findings imply that the external debt in our panel \nof 24 Asian emerging and developing countries is sustainable in the long run. \n \nFinally,  we  analyze  the  vulnerabilities,  factors,  and  risks  in  the  region  due  to  different \nexternal debt criteria (the debt currency composition, share of the short-term external debt, \namount  of  reserves,  and  debt  service).  We  conclude  this  study  by  establishing  different \nprospective  scenarios  on  the  Asian  emerging  and  developing  countries  according  to  the \ndegree  of  economic  slowdown  (i.e.,  a  \u201csoft\u201d  or  \u201chard\u201d  landing) in  the  People's  Republic  of \nChina. \n \nJEL Classification: C33, F32, F34, O53 \n \n", " \n"]}
