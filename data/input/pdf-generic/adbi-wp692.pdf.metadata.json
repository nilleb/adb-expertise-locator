INTRODUCTION \nSince  the  1980s,  most  Asian  countries  have  pursued  processes  for  economic \nliberalization at the internal and external levels (openness to foreign trade and capital \nflows). The implementation of such programs especially implies that governments \ncarry out a substantial stabilization of their external deficits. The main objective of \nthese measures is for external deficit to become sustainable in the long run in order to \navoid the negative consequences of large external deficits and debt crises. \nAs the issue of public debt sustainability has gained in importance in Asia (as reflected \nin  a  book  by  Ferrarini,  Ramayandi,  and  Jha  [2012]  on  this  topic),  external  debt \nsustainability has become important too, following the 1997 financial Asian crisis and \nthe 2008\u20132009 global financial and economic crisis. External debt sustainability is a \nrelevant  topic  in  the  region  for  several  reasons:  (i)  to  maintain  foreign  investor \nconfidence in the economy; (ii) to address the adverse effects1 on the external debt \nposition; (iii) to prevent a debt crisis; and (iv) because of the current high level of \nuncertainty in this period of the People's Republic of China's (PRC) \u201csoft landing\u201d \ngrowth,  which  is  inducing  a  decline  in  some  commodity  prices  and  a  decline  in \ninternational trade flows between Asian countries. \nAs a result, we explore the external debt sustainability issue by employing a panel \napproach on 24 Asian emerging and developing countries over the period 1993\u20132014. \nA panel approach is appropriate given the strong economic, trade, and finance links \namong the economies of the region. The interests of this study are many and varied.  \nFirst, we consider a total panel of 24 emerging and developing Asian countries,2 which \nhas never been used in the literature, and we divide this sample into four sub-panels, \nnamely Southeast Asia, Southwest Asia, Central Asia, and the Pacific (corresponding \nto the country classifications made for instance by the International Monetary Fund or \nthe World Bank). Second, we take into account a recent period, 1993\u20132014, which \nincludes the impacts of the 1997 Asian crisis and the 2008\u20132009 global financial crisis \non external debt sustainability over the four sub-panels. Third, to test the external \nsustainability, we employ both first and the second generation panel unit root and \ncointegration tests to take into account cross-sectional dependence among countries. \nIn  these  conditions,  we  use  the  present-value  methodology  to  determine  whether  \nthe country satisfies its intertemporal external constraint, namely whether the external \ndebt  is  sustainable  in  the  long  run.  Such  a  methodology  requires  studying  the  \npanel stationarity of external debt, the current account, imports, and exports, and the \ncointegration between these two last variables.  \nTo our knowledge,  no paper has tackled the issue of external debt sustainability in \nthese 24 emerging and developing Asian countries by applying recent econometric \nmethods for panel data. \n   \n                                                 \n1  Such as a sudden currency depreciation, which increases the amount of external debt denominated in \nforeign currency, or a rise in external debt interest rates. \n2  The People\u2019s Republic of China and Mongolia; Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, \nThailand, and Viet Nam); Southwest Asia (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka); \nCentral Asia (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan); the \nPacific (Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Tonga). The case of Asian developed \ncountries, such as Japan, Singapore, and the Republic of Korea, is not considered in this study. \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 692  M. Llorca \n \nThe outline of this article is as follows: Section 2 presents a brief survey of the \nexternal debt sustainability literature. Section 3 outlines the intertemporal approach \nto the current account. Section 4 provides a description of the data and reports the \neconometric findings. Section 5 analyzes the vulnerabilities, factors, and risks in the \nregion by using different external debt indicators, such as the debt service, the share of \nthe short-term external debt, the amount of total reserves, or again the debt currency \ncomposition.  Finally,  we  conclude  this  study  by  establishing  different  prospective \nscenarios on the Asian emerging and developing countries according to the degree of \nthe PRC economic slowdown (a \u201csoft\u201d or \u201chard\u201d landing). \n2.  SURVEY OF THE EXTERNAL DEBT  \nSUSTAINABILITY LITERATURE  \nThe  basic  issue  concerning  the  sustainability  of  external  deficits  has  gained \nimportance  in  developing  countries  as  well  as  among  political  leaders,  academic \neconomists, and researchers in international institutions. Indeed, debt sustainability \nhas become a highly important topic for governments because it requires the adoption \nof responsible policies in order to assure macroeconomic stability.  \nAs  a  result,  extensive  theoretical  and  empirical  literature  has  emerged  on  this  \ntopic since the 1990s. In most cases, time-series methods have been employed to \nexamine  whether  the  external  deficit  of  a  nation  is  effectively  consistent  with  its \nintertemporal  external  constraint  in  present-value  terms.  Moreover,  most  of  the \nempirical studies have focused on the United States and other industrial countries: the \nUnited States (Trehan and Walsh 1991; Husted 1992; Wickens and Uctum 1993; \nAhmed and Rogers 1995; Fisher 1995; Hakkio 1995; Leachman and Francis 2000; \nTakeushi  2010;  Christopoulos  and  Leon-Ledesma  2010),  the  United  States  and \nCanada (Otto 1992; Wu, Fountas, and Chen 1996), and the G7 countries (Liu and \nTanner  1996).  The  results  of  these  studies  generally reveal  that  external  deficits  \nare not sustainable for several major developed countries. However, relatively few \npapers (Sawada 1994; Coakley and Kulasi 1997; F\u00e8ve and Henin 1998; Pattichis and \nKanaan 2001; Jha 2003; Lau and Baharumshah 2003; Sun 2004; Berthomieu et al. \n2004; \u00d6nel and Uctulu 2006; Yilanci and \u00d6zcan 2008; Kim et al. 2009; Boengiu et al. \n2011) have applied similar econometric tests to assess the sustainability of external \ndeficits in developing countries. In short, the findings established by these studies \nsuggest  that  external  sustainability  conditions  are  hard  to  meet  in  a  number  of \ndeveloping countries. \nRecently,  some  papers  have  investigated  the  issue  of  external  sustainability  by \nadopting unit-root and/or cointegration tests for panel data. We can quote the work of \nWu (2000) and Wu, Chen, and Lee (2001) studying current account sustainability \namong industrial countries. In addition, applying an augmented Dickey-Fuller panel \ndata unit-root test within a seemingly unrelated regression, Holmes (2006) finds that \nexternal debt is sustainable for at least 12 Latin American countries. Ehrhart and Llorca \n(2007)  focus  on  a  panel  of  seven  South  Mediterranean  countries  and  use  first \ngeneration  panel  unit-root  tests  (Im,  Pesaran,  and  Shin  2003;  Maddala  and  Wu  \n1999; Choi 2001) and of cointegration tests (Predoni1999). Nasir and Noman (2012) \napply a two-step nonlinear framework to investigate the stationary property of the  \ndebt-to-external  earnings  ratio  for  36  countries  and  the  current  account-to-gross \nnational income ratio for 55 countries. Another method was developed on a panel of \n19 Asian countries from 1981 to 2010 by studying the mean-reverting behavior of the \nexternal  debt  (Lau,  Baharumshah,  and  Soon  2013).  Finally,  Lin  (2014)  examines  \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 692  M. Llorca \n \nthe sustainability of external debt for 21 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment countries by using a quantile regression model. \n3.  THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK:  \nTHE INTERTEMPORAL APPROACH  \nTO THE CURRENT ACCOUNT \nEconometric tests of current account sustainability consist of investigating whether the \ncountry satisfies its intertemporal external constraint. In other words, empirical studies \nabout this issue are based on the intertemporal approach to the current account. \nHusted (1992) provides a simple small-economy framework in which a representative \nhousehold is able to borrow and lend freely in international financial markets at a given \nworld rate of interest.  \nThe representative agent faces the following current period budget constraint: \nC =Y +B \u2212I \u2212(1+r )B    (1) \n0 0 0 0 0 \u22121\nwhere C , Y , B  and I  represent current consumption, output, international borrowing, \n0 0 0, 0\nand investment; r  is the one-period world interest rate; and (1+ r ) B is the initial debt \n0 0 -1 \nof the representative agent, corresponding to the country\u2019s external debt. \n \nEquation (1) must hold for every time period. Iterating (1) forward yields the economy\u2019s \nintertemporal budget constraint (see Husted [1992: 160]): \n\u221e\nB =\u2211\u03b4TB +lim \u03b4B    (2) \n0 t t n n\nn\u2192\u221e\nt=1\nwhere TB = X \u2212M =Y \u2212C \u2212I  represents the trade balance in period t, X equals \nt t t t t t t\nthe exports, M is the imports, and \u03b4 is the discount factor. \nt t\nA  necessary  and  sufficient  condition  for  external  sustainability  is  that  as  n\u2192\u221e ,  \nthe  discounted  value  of  the  external  debt  converges  asymptotically  to  zero.  This \ntransversality condition can be expressed as   \nlim\u03b4B =0  (3) \nn n\nn\u2192\u221e\nEquation (3) implies that a country cannot borrow (lend) indefinitely in global capital \nmarkets to finance its trade account deficit (surplus). If this transversality condition \nholds, then the amount of country borrows (lends) in international financial markets \nequals the present-value of the future trade surplus (deficits). \nAfter several manipulations, we finally get a testable equation: \n\u221e\nMt \u2212Xt =\u2211\u03bbj\u22121\uf8ee\uf8f0\u2206Xt+j \u2212\u2206Zt+j\uf8f9\uf8fb   (4) \nj=0\n   \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 692  M. Llorca \n \nGiven the right-hand variables from equation (4) are first-difference stationary, the left-\nhand side of equation (4) must be stationary in order to satisfy the present-value \nexternal constraint. Thus, M and X must be examined for stationarity. If M and X are \nt t t  t\nI(1), then they must be cointegrated so that the left-hand side of equation (7), i.e., the \ncurrent account deficit, is stationary. \nThus, a test for the sustainability of the external debt can check for the cointegration of \nthese two variables, M and X, if they are I(1). This cointegration regression takes the \nt t\nfollowing form: \nX = a + bM + u  (5)\nt t  t  \nFormally, if M and X are I(1), the null hypothesis is that M and X are cointegrated  \nt t t t\nand \u03b2 = 1. If the null hypothesis is not rejected, then the external debt is said to  \nbe sustainable. \n4.  EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION \n4.1  Sample and Data \nThe sustainability of external debt is assessed in a sample of 24 Asian emerging and \ndeveloping countries.3 We use annual data collected from the World Bank\u2019s World \nDevelopment Indicators. The sample covers the period 1993\u20132014 for the current \naccount, external debt, imports, and exports variables. The current account balance is \nthe sum of the net exports of goods, services, net income, and net current transfers. \nExternal debt is the debt owed to non-residents, repayable in foreign currency, goods, \nor services. Our measure of exports includes the exports of goods and services. Our \nmeasure of imports only comprises the imports of goods and services since the data on \nnet transfer payments and net interest payments are not available. All variables are \nmeasured in terms of their ratio to nominal GDP.  \n4.2  Features of the External Position of Asian Emerging  \nand Developing Countries \nFirst, we notice that external debt has fallen slightly over the last 2 decades in the \nglobal  panel  of  24  emerging  and  developing  Asian  countries  (see  Table  1  and \nFigure 1). However, we can see different paths according to the sub-panel group: a \nstrong decrease by more than half of the external debt in Southeast Asia, a decline of \n10 percentage points of GDP in Southwest Asia, and a slight decrease in the Pacific; \nmeanwhile, the external debt-to-GDP ratio shows an increase by 20 percentage points \nin Central Asia.  \n   \n                                                 \n3  However, data for exports and imports in the cases of Papua New Guinea and Samoa are missing, so \nwe do not include these two countries in the study of the cointegration relationship, and we cannot \nconstitute the Pacific panel for this step. \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 692  M. Llorca \n \nFigure 1: External Debt Evolution in Emerging and Developing Asian Countries \n(% of GDP) \n \nSource: World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators. \nSpecifically, if we consider the external debt evolution by country (Appendix, Table A.1, \nwe notice that four countries (the PRC, India, Azerbaijan, and Fiji) have a low level of \nexternal debt (less than 20% of GDP), whereas seven nations (Mongolia, Bhutan, \nArmenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Papua New Guinea, namely \nfour countries from Central Asia) have a high level of external debt (more than 60% of \nGDP). Thus, in the four countries from Central Asia, external debt grew sharply from \n2000 to 2014, whereas all the other countries in the panel reduced their external \nindebtedness over these 2 decades, sometimes at a sustained pace (by more than 20 \npercentage points of GDP for the Philippines, Bangladesh, Tajikistan, Samoa, and \nSolomon Islands; by more than 30 percentage points of GDP for Indonesia, Thailand, \nand Nepal; and even by more than 70 points of GDP for Viet Nam). \nTable 1: External Debt Evolution in Asian Emerging and Developing Countries \n(% of GDP) \nPanel  1993\u20131999  2000\u20132007  2008\u20132014  Average \nSoutheast Asia  55.5  39.8  25.3  40.2 \nSouthwest Asia  40.2  39.8  31.7  37.3 \nCentral Asia  33.7  49.3  52.4  45.3 \nPacific   42.5  35.4  38.7  38.7 \nGlobal panel  41.0  40.3  38.3  39.9 \nSource: Author\u2019s calculations from the World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators. \n   \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 692  M.

Llorca \n \nPacific countries have a very high level of current account deficit during the last period, \nmore than 10% of GDP for Solomon Islands and even more than 20% for Papua New \nGuinea. Similarly, some Central Asian countries (Georgia, the Kyrgyz Republic, and \nArmenia), and Bhutan and Mongolia have a current account deficit higher than 10% of \nGDP  between  2008  and  2014.  Meanwhile,  among  countries  accumulating  current \naccount surpluses, we have Azerbaijan (with a surplus of more than 20% of GDP \nduring the last period), Malaysia (with a surplus of around 10% of GDP on average \nsince 2000), and the PRC, the Philippines, and Thailand with surpluses higher than 3% \nof GDP during the last period.  \nFinally,  according  to  the  global  panel,  exports  and  imports  (Appendix  C)  have \nincreased gradually with a higher increase in Southeast Asia than in Southwest Asia \nand Central Asia (and even a slight decrease for imports in the latter sub-panel). \n4.3  Empirical Results \nMost  empirical  tests  of  external  sustainability  study  whether  the  observed \ncharacteristics of the external debt-related variables satisfy the solvency condition in \nequation  (3).  As  in  time  series  studies,  in  the  case  of  panel  data  analysis,  the \neconometric methodology employed to test this solvency condition consists mainly of \ntwo steps.  \nIn the first step, the stationary properties of the current account, exports, imports and \nstock of external debt are studied using unit-root tests for panel data. External debt \nsustainability requires that these external variables be integrated of order zero. \nIf imports and exports are found to be integrated of order one (non-stationary), it is \nimportant to investigate in a second step whether there is a cointegration relationship \nbetween imports and exports. Cointegration among these variables is a necessary \ncondition for external sustainability. \n4.3.1  Unit Root Results \nThe unit root tests can be classified into two groups, depending on whether they \naccount for cross-sectional dependence or not. The first generation panel unit root \ntests (Im, Pesaran, and Shin 2003; Maddala and Wu 1999; Choi 2001) have been \ncriticized  because  they  assume  cross-sectional  independence.  This  hypothesis  is \nrather restrictive and unrealistic since macroeconomic time series exhibit significant \ncross-sectional  correlation  among  countries  in  a  panel  (Baltagi  2008),  and  co-\nmovements  of  economies  are  often  observed  in  the  majority  of  macroeconomic \napplications  of  unit  root  tests  (Hurlin  and  Mignon  2005).  The  presence  of  cross-\nsectional correlation of errors in panel data applications in economics is likely to be the \nrule  rather  than  the  exception  (Chudik  and  Pesaran  2015).  Moreover,  correlation \nacross units in panels may have significant consequences on the first generation of \ntests  assuming  cross-sectional  independence.  When  applied  to  cross-sectionally \ndependent panels, such panel unit root tests can generate substantial size distortions \n(O\u2019Connell 1998). As a result, alternative (second generation) panel unit root tests  \n(Bai and Ng 2004; Chang 2002, 2004; Choi 2002; Moon and Perron 2004; Phillips and \nSul 2003; Pesaran 2007) have been proposed to take into account cross-sectional \ndependence. \nThe results of the Pesaran test of cross-sectional dependence are shown in Table 3.  \n   \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 692  M.

Second, the CD test strongly rejects the null \nhypothesis of cross-sectional independence in Southeast Asia and Southwest Asia, \nsuggesting the presence of cross-sectional dependence in these two sub-panels. To \nstudy the issue of external sustainability, it is necessary to employ second generation \npanel unit root tests (Pesaran 2007) allowing for this cross-country dependence in \nSoutheast Asia and Southwest Asia. Finally, we propose to use both first and second \ngeneration unit root tests for the global panel and for Central Asia because the CD test \nreveals opposite results between the variables of external debt-current account and \nexports-imports. \nAs shown in Table 4 (see also Appendix, Tables 5 and 6), the panel unit root tests \nindicate that for the global panel and Central Asia, the current account and external \ndebt  variables  are  stationary  in  level  (or  integrated  of  order  0),  according  to  the  \nfirst  generation  test,  which  is  a  condition  necessary  (but  insufficient)  for  external \nsustainability.  However,  for  the  sub-panels,  Southwest  Asia  and  the  Pacific,4 the \ncurrent account and external debt variables are stationary in first difference (integrated \nof order 1). In addition, imports and exports are integrated of the same order in the \nglobal panel and for Southeast Asia, Southwest Asia, and Central Asia, so we can \nproceed to the next step in the study of external sustainability, namely the panel \ncointegration tests. \n                                                 \n4  However, we cannot say that external debt is not sustainable in this region because we cannot proceed \nto the cointegration tests between imports and exports due to missing data on these variables for Papua \nNew Guinea and Samoa. \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 692  M.

According to these \nresults, we can conclude that the null hypothesis of no cointegration between export \nand import ratios is rejected. The findings imply that in a panel perspective, external \ndebt is sustainable in the long run in the global panel and in the sub-panel for Central \nAsia. Moreover, using the Westerlund panel cointegration tests (second generation \npanel unit root tests) for the global panel, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and Southwest \nAsia, all the panel tests reject the null hypothesis, so external debt is sustainable, too, \nin these four panels.  \n9 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 692  M.

VULNERABILITY FACTORS AND RISKS IN ASIAN \nEMERGING AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES:  \nA PROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS \nFollowing this analysis of the external debt in Asian emerging and developing countries \nover the past 2 decades, it is relevant, too, to consider the future path of the external \ndebt. We propose analyzing the vulnerabilities, factors, and risks associated with the \nexternal debt of Asian countries. \nThus, four external debt criteria must be taken into account to assess the risk of future \nfinancial  turmoil  on  the  external  debt  of  an  Asian  country:  the  debt  currency \ncomposition,  the  share  of  the  short-term  external  debt,  the  debt  service,  and  the \namount of total reserves. \nThe first external vulnerability factor is the debt currency composition. Indeed, since \nMay 2014 and the appreciation of the US dollar against Asian currencies, exchange \nrate movements have increased the external debt burden denominated in US dollars. \nThis is notably the case for Central Asian countries (such as the Kyrgyz Republic and \nTajikistan) or even India, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines, which have high \nexposure to the appreciation of the US dollar against their local currencies. On the \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 692  M. Llorca \n \ncontrary, countries indebted in a foreign currency that depreciates against their local \ncurrencies can benefit from a decrease in their external debt burden. This is the case \nfor  Kazakhstan  and  Georgia,  which  are  massively  indebted  in  pounds  sterling  \n(by, respectively, 96% and 70% of their external debt). Indeed, they benefitted from the \ndepreciation  of  the  pound  sterling  since  the  United  Kingdom\u2019s  Brexit  decision  on \n23 June 2016. \nThe  share  of  short-term  external  debt  can  constitute  a  second  factor  for  external \nvulnerability  in  times  of  tension  on  external  debt.  However,  all  the  emerging  and \ndeveloping Asian countries have low levels of short-term external debt as a percentage \nof their total external debt, except for Thailand and Malaysia with around 40%\u201350% of \nshort-term external debt and the PRC with more than 70%. \nThe third criterion is the level of debt service, expressed as a percentage of export \nrevenue. Indeed, we can notice that some Asian developing and emerging countries \nare constrained by their debt service, reaching more than 20% of exports in 2014 for \nPakistan, Indonesia, and Georgia and even more than 30% in Armenia, Kazakhstan, \nand Tajikistan. On the other hand, countries such as the PRC, Viet Nam, Azerbaijan, \nBangladesh, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines have higher margins (or space) \ndue to low debt servicing and their high levels of exports revenue.  \nFinally, the last indicator to focus on is the amount of total reserves, expressed as a \npercentage of total external debt or in months of imports. On the one hand, some \ncountries are well protected against external adverse events (such as financial crises in \nthe region). These include the PRC, Azerbaijan, Thailand, the Philippines, Bhutan, \nBangladesh, and India due to their high levels of reserves accumulated since 2000. On \nthe other hand, Central Asian countries, with the exception of Azerbaijan, have a weak \nposition. A notable example is Tajikistan with a very low amount of reserves in months \nof imports.  \nAccording to these four external debt criteria (Appendix, Table A.7), we can expect an \nimportant threat to the future path of the external debt of Central Asian countries \n(except Azerbaijan), notably for Tajikistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and, to a lesser extent, \nGeorgia. In addition, with the decline in the commodity prices over the current period, \nthe Central Asian countries cannot accumulate enough reserves to face a future crisis. \nHowever, the external debt prospects are better in Southeast Asia and Southwest Asia, \nwhere countries have important reserves at their disposal to act as shock absorbers in \nthe case of a crisis. \nAs a result, in this time of uncertainty in the world and in the region, we must consider \ntwo alternative scenarios in Asia and their consequences on the external debt position \nof Asian countries.5  \nThe first optimistic scenario is based on a PRC \u201csoft landing\u201d (with a growth of around \n6%\u20136.5%) with a stabilization at the current level of the oil Brent price ($ 50 per barrel). \nIn this context, countries that are most integrated with the PRC, through international \ntrade channels, will register a decrease in their exports to the PRC and so will have \nless export revenue to finance their external debt. Similarly, we can expect that the \nPRC will reduce its foreign direct investment flows to Asian countries, resulting in less \nincome to finance external deficits. In such a situation, Southeast Asian countries, such \nas Thailand, will be the most affected. However, because of their levels of reserves \naccumulated over the past years, there is no worry about the financing of their external \n                                                 \n5  These uncertainties include the PRC\u2019s economic slowdown, movements in commodity prices, volatility \nof financial markets and exchange rates, the gradual increase of the Federal Reserve rate, the \nappreciation of the US dollar, and other external events such as the Brexit decision or political risks. \n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 692  M. Llorca \n \nposition. Even in the case of a strong appreciation of the US dollar (induced by the \nfuture increase of the Federal Reserve rate, for instance), the external debt burden \ndenominated  in  US  dollars  will  increase.  Moreover,  Asian  countries  that  produce \ncommodities, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and some Central Asian countries, will be \naffected  negatively  by  the  current  commodity  cycle  and  be  unable  to  accumulate \nenough  reserves  for  the  future.  The  situation  for  Central  Asian  countries  (except \nAzerbaijan)  is  even  more  troubling,  particularly  for  Kazakhstan,  because  of  their \nexternal debt situations and their trade and financial integration with the PRC through \nthe new \u201cSilk Road.\u201d Indeed, the PRC slowdown could report in the future some \nprojects  or  financing  of  this  development  strategy  affecting  Kazakhstan  and  their \nexternal account.  \nThe second scenario is based on a \u201chard landing\u201d for the PRC (with a growth rate less \nthan 5%), resulting notably from the high level of PRC domestic private debt and the \nincrease of non-performing loans affecting the PRC\u2019s banking and shadow banking \nsector.  In  this  worst-case  scenario,  the  entire  region  will  be  affected  through \ninternational trade and finance channels. In this period of financial stress, we can \nexpect  outflows  of  portfolio  investment  and  foreign  direct  investment  so  that  the \nweakest countries in terms of reserves must use their reserves to face the external \ncrisis. Moreover, a \u201chard landing\u201d for the PRC would induce a slowdown in the use of \nits raw materials, and so commodity prices would decline, affecting countries that \nproduce natural resources more severely.  \nAmid  a  financing  \u201ccrunch\u201d,  Asian  countries  can  use  their  accumulated  reserves  \nfrom the last decade to face the economic and financial shocks. However, countries \nwith insufficient levels of reserves\u2014such as the Central Asian countries, Pakistan, \nSri Lanka, or even Viet Nam\u2014will be affected by a negative dynamic to finance their \nexternal deficits and debt.  \n6.  CONCLUSION  \nIn this study, we conducted a formal test of whether the external debt in 24 emerging \nand developing Asian countries is sustainable in the long run. We performed recent \npanel unit-root and cointegration tests for panel data for the period 1993\u20132014 to \nexamine whether the external positions have been coherent with their inter-temporal \nexternal constraints. Moreover, we divided our sample into four sub-panels\u2014Southeast \nAsia, Southwest Asia, Central Asia, and the Pacific\u2014to identify specific external trade \nand debt trends.  \nWe find that over the last 2 decades, external debt has been sustainable in the region \nand  in  the  sub-panels  considered.  The  economic  implication  of  this  result  is  that \nimports and exports move together in the long run. Moreover, Southeast Asian and \nSouthwest Asian countries benefited from their export revenues during the 2000s to \naccumulate reserves that can be used in the future to buffer strong external shocks.  \nAs a result, by taking into account four criteria of external vulnerabilities (the debt \ncurrency composition, share of short-term debt, debt service, and amount of reserves), \nthe external debt position in emerging and developing Asian countries is not worrying, \ncontrary  to  the  current  external  positions  of  some  African  (Angola,  Mozambique, \nGhana, Congo) or Latin American countries (Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina). However, it \nis important to be vigilant and monitor the external situation of some Central Asian \ncountries (Tajikistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Kazakhstan) due to the deterioration of their \nexternal deficits in the recent period of declining oil prices and the appreciation of the \nUS dollar against their local currencies. \n12 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 692  M. Llorca \n \nFinally, with the current changing cycle of commodities prices, it is important for Asian \ncountries that produce commodities to diversify their economic structure and avoid the \nDutch disease prophecy6. Similarly, Asian countries that are closely integrated with the \nPRC must diversify their international trade relationships with trading partners, such  \nas India. \n   \n                                                 \n6  Such mechanism was used to describe the economic situation of the Netherlands during the 1960s \nwhen they discovered gas fields in the North Sea. It is defined as the negative effects resulting from an \nincrease in important commodities export in a country. \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 692  M. Llorca \n \nREFERENCES \nAhmed, S., and J.

We use the present-value methodology to determine whether a country satisfies its intertemporal external constraint, namely whether its external debt is sustainable in the long run. According to such methodology, we study the panel stationarity of external debt, current account, imports, and exports, then the cointegration between these two last variables. We employ unit root and cointegration tests, the first and second generation tests, to take into account cross-sectional dependence. Our findings imply that the external debt in our panel of 24 Asian emerging and developing countries is sustainable in the long run. Finally, we analyze the vulnerabilities, factors, and risks in the region due to different external debt criteria (the debt currency composition, share of the short-term external debt, amount of reserves, and debt service). We conclude by establishing different prospective scenarios on the Asian emerging and developing countries according to the degree of the Chinese economic slowdown (a \u201csoft\u201d or \u201chard\u201d landing).", "Title": "External Debt Sustainability and Vulnerabilities: Evidence from a Panel of 24 Asian Countries and Prospective Analysis"}}
