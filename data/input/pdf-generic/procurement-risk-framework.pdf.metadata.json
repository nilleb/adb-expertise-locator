These replace the former Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) and Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). The procurement policy and the \nprocurement regulations address the procurement activities of project executing \nagencies and implementing agencies on projects financed in whole or in part by a \nloan or grant from ADB, or by ADB-administered funds. ADB designed the 2017 \nprocurement policy to deliver significant benefits and flexibility throughout the \nproject procurement cycle, as well as to improve project delivery through a renewed \nfocus on the concepts of quality, value for money (VFM), and fitness for purpose.\nThis note is part of a series of guidance notes published by ADB in 2018 to \naccompany the 2017 procurement policy and the procurement regulations. \nEach\u00a0note discusses a topical issue for borrowers (including grant recipients), \nbidders, and civil society under the new framework (see list below). The guidance \nnotes cross-reference each other frequently and should be read in conjunction. \nAll\u00a0references to \u201cguidance notes\u201d pertain to these notes.

VFM is part of a holistic procurement structure \nwith three support pillars: efficiency, quality, and flexibility. The two key principles of \ntransparency and fairness weave across all elements of the structure.\nTransparency\nValue for Money\nThe effective, efficient, and economic use of resources,  \nwhich requires an evaluation of relevant costs and benefits along  \nwith an assessment of risks, nonprice attributes, and/or total cost  \nof ownership as appropriate\nEfficiency Quality Flexibility\n\u2022\tDecreased transaction  \u2022\tContract management  \u2022\tOpen competitive \ncosts support bidding\n\u2022\tIncreased skills \u2022\tPrompt resolution of  \u2022\tDecentralization\n\u2022\tIncreased high-level  complaints \u2022\tAccreditation \ntechnology usage \u2022\tImproved developing  for alternative \n\u2022\tImproved  member country  procurement \nprocurement planning procurement process  arrangements\n\u2022\tSupport and  \u2022\tImproved  \u2022\tPrinciples-based \nencouragement  procurement planning decisions\nof e-procurement  \u2022\tGovernance \u2022\tImproved \nsystems \u2022\tContracts with clear  procurement planning\nperformance criteria \u2022\tDelegation\n\u2022\tMinimal number of  \u2022\tBids with weighted  \ncomplaints proposal  \n\u2022\tImproved ADB  criteria \nprocesses \nFairness\nTime\nTime is an important element of VFM. When a project is delivered promptly or when a \nprocess is completed rapidly, greater value is created for all stakeholders. For example, a \nroad project completed early provides economic benefit, security, or other value to the \ncommunity it serves. It increases the return on investment to the executing agency and \naccelerates the project and payment cycle to the successful bidder. Likewise, a project \ndelivered late loses significant value. \nWhen considering VFM in the context of procurement, pay attention to anything \nthat (i)\u00a0shortens the procurement cycle time frame or (ii) accelerates delivery of the \ndevelopment project.", "About This Publication ix\nObjective\nThis guidance note is intended to assist readers by elaborating on and explaining  \nADB\u2019s 2017\u00a0procurement policy and procurement regulations for borrowers \n(including grant\u00a0recipients). \nThis note identifies additional information for the reader to consider when applying ADB\u2019s \nprocurement policy and procurement regulations to their circumstances. \nLiving Document\nThis guidance note is intended to be a living document and will be revised as required.\nBe sure to check the ADB Business Center website for the latest version and updates,  \nhttps://www.adb.org/business/main.\nThe Reader \nIn many circumstances, readers are expected to use this guidance note in a manner unique \nto their needs.

The \npurpose of risk management is to minimize the impacts of possible adverse events \non achievement of the objectives of a project financed in whole or in part by an \nADB loan or grant, or by ADB-administered funds.\n1.2  The procurement risk framework describes how risks are identified, \nassessed, and managed at the country and sector/agency levels and how those risks \nare used as inputs into the identification, assessment, and management of risk at \nthe project level.\n1.3  The framework emphasizes the need to treat and manage risks \nafter identification and highlights that risk management is an ongoing activity. \nAssessments and risk treatments need to be updated on a continuous basis as risks \nchange and new risks are identified.\n1.4  The framework is principles-based and not compliance-based, in line \nwith the ADB Procurement Policy: Goods, Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting \nServices (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for \nADB Borrowers: Goods, Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting Services (2017, as \namended from time to time). This approach supports ADB\u2019s core procurement \nprinciples of economy, efficiency, fairness, transparency, quality, and value for \nmoney (VFM).\n1.5  Risk management and VFM are closely linked. Figure 1 describes how \nVFM depends on quality, cost, and sustainability, with each of these aspects \nincorporating the components listed. Adverse impacts to any of these three aspects \ncan adversely impact VFM:\n(i)  An increase in the cost of a procurement or project directly \nimpacts VFM, if it is not associated with improvements in quality or \nsustainability.\n(ii)  Lower quality adversely impacts VFM, if it is not associated with \ncompensating reductions in cost.", "2 Procurement Risk Framework\nFigure 1: Risk Management\u2019s Contribution to Value for Money\n\u2022 Buildability\n\u2022 Functionality\n\u2022 Maintainability\n\u2022 Operability\nQuality\nValue \nfor money\nRisk\nManagement\nCost Sustainability\n\u2022 Environment\n\u2022 Purchase cost\n\u2022 Safety\n\u2022 Life cyle costs\n\u2022 Probity\n\u2022 Schedule\n\u2022 Economic development\n\u2022 Local procurement\nSource: Asian Development Bank.", " Introduction 3\n(iii) Adverse sustainability outcomes, such as environmental pollution or \npoor project or operational safety, have either direct or downstream \nimpacts on VFM. Even if quality and cost objectives are met, achieving \nthese at the cost of damage to the environment compromises VFM. \n1.6  Risk management is an essential part of the ADB procurement cycle \nbecause it ensures that risks to quality, cost, and sustainability are identified and \nmitigated so that VFM and project objectives are more likely to be achieved. \nFigure\u00a02 shows the ADB procurement cycle. \nFigure 2: The ADB Procurement Cycle\nCountry Partnership \nStrategy\nCountry and Sector/Agency \nProcurement Risk Assessment\nFeedback or Evaluation\nProject Conceptualization\nProject Completion Report\nTransaction Technical Assistance \nContract Close \nLessons Learned Q uality Econom Procurement Risk Categorization\ny\ncy Tra Procurement Planning \nImplementation and n n Procurement Plan\nContract Management e PROCUREMENT sp Project Procurement Risk \nContract Management Plan icffi CYCLE nera Project AAdmssiensissmtraetniot n Manual\nE c\ny\nMVoanlueey for Fairness\nContract Award Bidding\nBidding Documents\nBid Evaluation\nEvaluation Reports\nSource: Asian Development Bank.", "II.\u2003Purpose\n2.1  The purpose of this guidance note is to present ADB\u2019s procurement risk \nframework and explain how it is applied at each stage of the procurement cycle.\n2.2  The procurement risk framework applies to different entity/organizational \nlevels (country, sector/agency, and project) and to each stage of the project life \ncycle\u2014a continuous process that cascades through the project and procurement \ncycles.\n2.3  The borrower (or grant recipient) and ADB are responsible for managing \nrisk at different stages of the procurement cycle, and they need to work together \nto ensure that risks are identified and managed effectively.

These inputs are \nused to assist in the identification of risks at each stage. Risks are then assessed \nin terms of likelihood and consequence. The output of the risk assessment \nprocess is the identification and implementation of measures to mitigate the \nrisks. Implementation of the mitigation measures happens via the measures being \nassigned to the appropriate party to action as required. Progress on the mitigation \nmeasures should be monitored on a continuous basis to ensure that they are \nimplemented and effective. Finally, risk assessments should be updated to reflect \nany changes to risks or any new risks.\nB.   The Procurement Risk Framework Applies \nat\u00a0Different Organizational/Entity Levels\n3.5  The procurement risk framework applies at the country, sector/agency, \nand project levels.

The Procurement Risk Framework Applies \nthroughout the Procurement Cycle\n3.6  The procurement risk framework begins at the time of preparation \nof the country partnership strategy (CPS). At this time, a country and sector/\nagency procurement risk assessment (CSPRA) is developed, identifying risks at \nthe country and sector/agency levels. The CSPRA assesses the legislative and \nregulatory framework governing public procurement, the institutional framework \nand management capacity, procurement operations and market practices, and the \nintegrity and transparency of public procurement systems.\n3.7  At the project conceptualization stage, the procurement risk is \ncategorized as either risk category \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d by ADB, and this categorization is \nused to determine the level of involvement of ADB procurement resources in the \npreparation of the project.\n3.8  The project procurement risk assessment (PPRA) is undertaken during \nthe procurement planning stage and considers the particular risks associated \nwith the project along with more detailed information about the supply market. \nThe Guidance Note on Strategic Procurement Planning discusses the PPRA \nprocess\u00a0further.\n3.9  The contract management plan (CMP) is the risk management tool used \nto ensure that procurement risks applicable at the implementation and contract \nmanagement stage are effectively managed. The Guidance Note on Contract \nManagement discusses the CMP further.\n3.10  The borrower and ADB are responsible for different risk management \nactivities throughout the procurement and need to work together to ensure \nthat risks are identified and managed effectively. While the borrower is directly \nresponsible for such actions, ADB has a fiduciary responsibility to ensure risks are \nidentified and managed within country and sector strategies, and at agency and \nproject levels. Table 2 outlines the responsibilities of ADB and the borrower with \nrespect to risk management.\n3.11  At the procurement planning stage, while the borrower is responsible for \ndirect actions, ADB will provide the borrower with relevant information and inputs \nthat can be used by the borrower in developing the procurement plan. ADB will \ncarry out the PPRA to identify potential risks associated with the project, assess the \nlevel of risks, and propose mitigation measures.

The Procurement Risk Framework Is Continuous \nand\u00a0Cascades through the Procurement Cycle\n3.12  Risk management begins at the CPS stage and cascades through \nthe procurement cycle. The outputs from each stage of the procurement risk \nframework become the inputs for the next stage. Each risk assessment builds on \nthe previous risk framework stage and is supplemented with additional information \nas the focus of the assessment becomes more targeted toward the project.\n3.13  Figure 3 shows that the CSPRA is produced using, among others \n(i)  inputs of previous CSPRAs;\n(ii)  literature review (such as reviews based on the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development\u2019s \u201cMethodology for \nAssessing Procurement Systems,\u201d assessments completed following \nthe Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability framework, and \ninternet search); and\n(iii) review of relevant ADB data (including information such as country \nprocurement data and project procurement-related reviews by ADB\u2019s \nOffice of Anticorruption and Integrity). \n3.14  In turn, the project procurement risk categorization conducted at the \nproject conceptualization stage uses the CSPRA as an input and results in a \nprocurement risk category for the project.\n3.15  In procurement planning, the CSPRA and the procurement risk category \nare inputs into the PPRA, along with an external (including market) analysis and an \ninternal requirements analysis. The outputs are the PPRA, a project procurement \nrisk register, possibly a stakeholder communication plan, and a procurement \nstrategy and plan.", "10 Procurement Risk Framework\n3.16  The PPRA, procurement risk register, stakeholder communication plan, \nand procurement strategy and plan are inputs into the CMP, which is used to \nmanage risk during contract implementation.\n3.17  At each stage of the procurement risk framework, the focus narrows, \nand the risks from the previous stage are filtered for relevance to the current \nassessment. For instance, in developing the PPRA, the focus narrows from country \nand sector to agency and project, and only those risks in the CSPRA that impact the \nproject are considered for inclusion in the PPRA.\nE.   Risks Must Be Managed after Identification\n3.18  An important point emphasized in this guidance note is that simply \nidentifying and assessing risks is not sufficient. To reduce risks to an acceptable \nlevel, mitigating measures must be identified that are effective in reducing the \nrisk, and these measures must be implemented. To ensure that the measures are \nimplemented, progress of implementation of the measures needs to be monitored \nand managed.\n3.19  To enable the monitoring and management of mitigation measures, \nmitigation actions should be documented in a risk assessment document.\n3.20  Risk management is not a one-time exercise. Following the initial \nrisk assessment, risks may change or new risks may become apparent. The \nrisk assessment should be updated in response to changed conditions, or new \ninformation on risks, and at key points in the procurement process to ensure that \nrisks are effectively managed.\n3.21  Figure 5 describes how risks identified in the PPRA and during \nprocurement planning are managed through bidding and contract award to \ncontract implementation.\n3.22  Risks identified in the PPRA are managed through the selection of \nprocurement arrangements, e.g., the procurement method, contract structure, \ncontract terms and performance measures, and other mitigating actions. Mitigating \nmeasures and action owners should be documented in the PPRA and any \nassociated risk register and/or stakeholder communication plan.\n3.23  As the project progresses to the bidding stage, the PPRA and risk \nregister should be reviewed considering any new information coming out of the \nbid responses that impacts on the risks or mitigation measures. For example, \nbid clarifications may include changes to specifications and bidder structure \nnot initially anticipated, which may require additional measures to mitigate \nimplementation risks.\n3.24  Following bid evaluation and contract award, relevant risks in the updated \nPPRA should be included in the CMP, along with mitigation actions and action ", "The Procurement Risk Framework 11\nFigure 5: Risk Management through Planning, Bidding, and Implementation\nProcurement  Bidding  Contract\nPlanning and Award Implementation\nProject  PPRA revised to  Identi\ufb01cation of \nprocurement risk  re\ufb02ect any new  any new risks that \nassessment  or altered risks  arise during \nidenti\ufb01es  or risk mitigations  contract \nand assesses  arising as a result  implementation\nprocurement risks  of bid responses\nRisk \nthrough the bid \nIdenti\ufb01cation process, and \nimplementation\nMitigation \nmeasures \nspeci\ufb01ed\nEconomy\nEfficiency\nFairness\nRisks are managed  CMP takes  Contract  Transparency\nvia the  risks from the  management \nQuality\nprocurement  revised PPRA  includes \nValue \narrangements  that are to be  monitoring and \n(i.e., procurement  managed during  managing risks  for Money\nmethod, contract  contract  in the CMP and \nstructure, contract  implementation,  any other \nRisk\nterms,  and the  issues or risks \nManagement performance  corresponding  that occur during \nmeasures, etc.) mitigation  implementation\nRisk register measures\nStakeholder \ncommunication \nplan\nCMP = contract management plan, PPRA = project procurement risk assessment.\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\nowners. In addition, the CMP should include any other risks (and mitigating \nactions) relevant to contract implementation that were not included in the \nPPRA. The risks and mitigating actions in the CMP then need to be monitored \nby the borrower to ensure they are implemented and effective. This can be done \nby including review of the CMP risk register as a standing item in the contract \nmanagement meetings with the contractor(s). Any changes to risks or any new risks \nidentified should be reflected in the risk register.", "IV.\u2003Risk Assessment and Treatment\n4.1  After risks have been identified, they need to be assessed and treatments \nconsidered.\nA.   Assessing Risks\n4.2  Risk assessment involves the following steps:\n(i)  estimating the likelihood of the risk being realized,\n(ii)  estimating the consequence of the risk being realized,\n(iii) determining the risk rating, and\n(iv) prioritizing risks for treatment. \n4.3  The risk likelihood table in Appendix 1 should be used to estimate the \nlikelihood of the risk being realized, ranging from \u201cRare\u201d to \u201cAlmost Certain.\u201d A risk \nlikelihood score between 1 and 5 should be determined for the risk corresponding \nto the likelihood of the risk occurring.\n4.4  The risk consequence table in Appendix 1 should be used to estimate the \nconsequence of the risk being realized, ranging from \u201cInsignificant\u201d to \u201cSevere.\u201d \nThe risk consequence table categorizes impacts of risks according to how they \nwould negatively affect the achievement of ADB\u2019s core procurement principles of \neconomy, efficiency, fairness, transparency, quality, and value for money.\n4.5  The consequences of the risk being realized should be estimated using \nthe most appropriate categories from this list. If a risk has impacts in more than one \nimpact category, the highest rated impact should be recorded. A risk consequence \nscore between 1 and 5 based on the highest rated impact should be determined for \nthe risk corresponding to the consequence of the risk occurring.\n4.6  The risk rating should then be determined using the risk rating matrix \nin Appendix 1, using the risk likelihood score and the risk consequence score to \ndetermine a risk rating. For example, a risk with risk likelihood score of 4 (\u201cLikely\u201d) \nand a risk consequence score of 3 (\u201cModerate\u201d) has a risk rating of \u201cHigh\u201d \n(Appendix 1).\n4.7  Risks should then be prioritized for treatment. Risks rated \u201cExtreme\u201d and \n\u201cHigh\u201d should be given special attention, but treatments to mitigate \u201cMedium\u201d and \n\u201cLow\u201d risks should also be considered as appropriate.", "Risk Assessment and Treatment 13\nB.   Treating Risks\n4.8  Following assessment of the risks, each risk should be treated in one of the \nfour ways described in Figure 6: \u201cavoid,\u201d \u201creduce,\u201d \u201ctransfer,\u201d or \u201caccept.\u201d\nFigure 6: Risk Treatment Options\nAvoid Avoid the risk by deciding not to proceed with the project or activity. \nReduce the likelihood of the occurrence, e.g., procurement approach, \ncontract terms and conditions, contract management activities, quality \nReduce control manuals, training, etc.\nReduce the consequence of the occurrence, e.g., contingency planning, \nrelocation of an activity or operation, etc.\nTransfer the risk to another party, e.g., contract terms, regarding liability \nTransfer\nand indemnity, insurance, etc.\nAccept the risk without mitigation. This may occur because\nAccept the risk rating is so low as to not warrant mitigation,\nthere is no treatment available, and/or\nthe costs of treatment outweigh the bene\ufb01ts.\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n4.9  In some cases, the only available mitigation measure may be \u201cavoidance.\u201d \nFor example, immature national procurement systems may be mitigated by \nrequiring ADB standard documents to be used for 100% of contracts financed in \nwhole or in part by an ADB loan or grant, or by ADB-administered funds. \n4.10  Risk mitigation measures should balance their effectiveness for reducing \nthe risk against their costs and effort to implement. Risks rated \u201cExtreme\u201d may \nwarrant additional resources and a specific management plan.", "V.\u2003Risk Management in the \nProcurement Cycle\nA.   Country and Sector/Agency Procurement  \nRisk Assessment\n5.1  During development of the CPS, ADB performs a CSPRA. The CSPRA \ngives a broad overview of procurement risks at country and sector/agency level. The \nlevel of the assessment will depend on existing knowledge and on an understanding \nof which sectors/agencies will be involved in projects.\n5.2  The CSPRA is carried out periodically, preferably at the same time as CPS \npreparation. However, if significant changes that could materially impact risk ratings \nhave been identified, it may be updated at any time during the CPS period.\n5.3  The CSPRA gives information for project concept preparation and \nprocurement risk categorization during the project conceptualization stage of \nthe procurement cycle. It also gives critical background information for PPRAs \ndeveloped at the procurement planning stage. Figure 7 describes the process for \nperforming a CSPRA.\n5.4  CSPRAs typically begin with a planning phase involving a desktop review \nof existing country procurement assessments and experience, and the application \nof a tool to assess country procurement risks. This review is used to develop a field \nwork plan and discussions with the government and other stakeholders.\n5.5  The purpose of discussions with the government and other stakeholders is \nto validate the initial country procurement assessment and to assess sector/agency \nrisks for key sectors. Findings are documented in the CSPRA report.\n5.6  Finally, the weaknesses identified in the CSPRA are converted to risks, \nthe risks are assessed, risk treatments are identified, and risks and mitigating \nmeasures are documented in a procurement risk assessment and management \nplan (P-RAMP). The overall country procurement risk is then determined, as is the \noverall sector risk for each key sector.\n5.7  Appendix 2 gives a detailed description of the CSPRA process, \nincluding references to tools and templates in Appendix 3 to Appendix 9 of this \nguidance\u00a0note.", "Risk Management in the Procurement Cycle 15\nFigure 7: The Country and Sector/Agency Procurement Risk \nAssessment\u00a0Process\nConduct  Determine \nPlan the CSPRA\nthe CSPRA Risk Classi\ufb01cation\n1.Perform initial desktop  1.

Project Conceptualization\n5.8  At the project conceptualization stage, an overall project procurement \nrisk category of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d is assigned by ADB. The categorization is used to guide \nproject preparation and due diligence.\n5.9  A categorization of \u201cA\u201d indicates high risk and will result in active \ninvolvement from the ADB procurement team throughout project preparation and \nprocessing.\n5.10  The project procurement risk categorization is a function of (i) the \nprocurement environment in the country and sector (or, where applicable, agency) \nand (ii) project-specific characteristics.\n5.11  The first step is to assess the procurement environment risk based on the \ncountry risk and the sector or agency risk applicable to the project, as determined in ", "16 Procurement Risk Framework\nthe CSPRA. The procurement environment risk matrix in Appendix 10 is then used \nto determine the procurement environment risk rating.\n5.12  The project procurement risk categorization tool in Appendix 10 should \nthen be completed. If the answer to one or more questions in the tool is \u201cYes,\u201d ADB \nshall assess and determine if additional procurement support to the borrower will \nbe required or if, despite the assessment, the borrower has adequate resources and/or \ninstitutional capacity to address procurement issues.\n5.13  If additional procurement support is deemed necessary, the project \nprocurement risk category shall be deemed as category \u201cA.\u201d If not, it shall be \ndeemed category \u201cB.\u201d\nC.   Procurement Planning\n5.14  At procurement planning stage, it will be necessary to assess the \nprocurement and market risks for the project, by developing a PPRA. \n5.15  The CSPRA is one input into the PPRA. The information in CSPRA will \nneed to be reviewed for currency and to determine whether it remains valid for the \nproject. If not, the CSPRA should be updated prior to development of the PPRA.\n5.16  At this stage, more details will be available concerning the project itself, \nthe precise agencies involved, the nature and scope of the requirements and the \ncontracts envisaged. The PPRA will use this information along with the CSPRA to \nassess more accurately the procurement risks for the project including market risks. \nRefer to the Guidance Note on Strategic Procurement Planning for details on project \nprocurement risk assessment.\n5.17  The PPRA and the associated procurement risk register are used to \ndevelop the procurement plan. \nD.   Implementation and Contract Management\n5.18  At the time of contract award, the risks identified in the PPRA and risk \nregister should be reviewed for relevance to the contract implementation stage and \nrelevant risks included in the CMP. In addition, any changes to risks and any newly \nidentified risks, along with associated mitigating actions, should be included in the \nCMP.\n5.19  The CMP and risk register should be updated throughout implementation \nto reflect any changes to risks or any new risks so that risks are managed effectively \nuntil project completion.

It also provides input into \nproject procurement risk categorization during the project conceptualization stage \nof the procurement cycle, and into the development of the project procurement \nrisk assessment (PPRA) at the procurement planning stage. The CSPRA \nincorporates the requirements of the Second Governance and Anticorruption \nAction Plan of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).\nA2.2  The CSPRA process is described in detail below.\nA.   Planning the Assessment\nA2.3  ADB (or consultants selected by ADB) will conduct the CSPRA. To plan \nthe assessment and determine the resources required, an initial desktop review \nis undertaken based on existing procurement assessments, as well as ADB\u2019s \nprocurement experience in the country and across key sectors.\n1.  Literature Review\nA2.4  The purpose of this step in the process is to identify information relating \nto public procurement systems. This can include, but is not limited to\n(i)  CSPRA Reports Carried Out by ADB: ADB may have carried out \nsuch assessments (or other similar assessments under different \nnames). These reports may be available from the ADB website or \nobtained from relevant ADB departments.\n(ii)  Country Procurement Assessment Reports (CPAR): The CPAR was \nthe World Bank\u2019s main instrument to assist its member countries in \nanalyzing their procurement policies, organization, and procedures. \nADB and other development partners regularly participated in the \nCPAR exercise. Publicly available CPARs can be found on the World \nBank website at http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/\ndocsearch/document-type/540617. \n(iii) Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, \nDevelopment Assistance Committee\u2019s Methodology for Assessing \nProcurement Systems (MAPS): Originally created in 2003\u20132004, \nthe MAPS is intended to provide a common tool to assess the quality \nand effectiveness of procurement systems.", "Appendix 2 21\n(iv) Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA): The \nPEFA Program was founded in 2001 as a multi-donor partnership to \nassess the condition of country public expenditure, procurement, \nand financial accountability systems. The PEFA Framework assesses \na country\u2019s public financial management across 31 indicators, one of \nwhich assesses the procurement monitoring, procurement methods, \npublic access to procurement information, and procurement \ncomplaints management. Publicly available PEFA assessments can be \nfound on the PEFA website: www.pefa.org.\n(v)  Internet Search: A variety of bilateral donors and nongovernment \norganizations regularly assess public procurement systems, including \nfrom the perspective of fiduciary risk assessment (i.e., the United \nKingdom\u2019s Department for International Development, Revenue Watch, \netc.). A web search on \u201cprocurement fiduciary assessment [country \nname]\u201d should be performed to identify additional secondary sources \nof information. The web search should also include e-procurement \nassessments by various international financial institutions, case studies, \npresentations and/or research papers relevant to the country. \n2.  ADB\u2019s Procurement Experience\nA2.5  In addition to the existing assessments of procurement systems, ADB\u2019s \nown experience at the country and sector/agency level should be reviewed:\n(i)  Country Procurement Data: The current portfolio of active contracts \nin the country, and priority sectors, is reviewed to identify potential \nrisks. The portfolio is reviewed from the perspective of total number of \ncontracts, contract value, and active contracts, as well as experience \nwith contract variations. Refer to Appendix 3 for data that may be \nneeded for the assessment and potential sources.\n(ii)  Existing CPS, Country Assistance Program Evaluation, and/or \nCPS Final Review: The existing CPS and relevant lessons learned \nshould be reviewed to understand better ADB\u2019s operations at the \ncountry level, and sector and thematic priorities. For CPSs prepared \nafter 2008, procurement risk assessment and management plans \n(P-RAMPs) should be available for the country and several priority \nsectors. The quality, completeness, and timeliness of the P-RAMPs \nshould be assessed. It may be useful to review any sector road maps \nprepared in conjunction with the relevant CPS (or CPS update) if the \ncontemplated procurement is targeted for such sectors.\n(iii) Office of Anticorruption and Integrity (OAI) Project Procurement-\nRelated Reviews (PPRRs): OAI conducts PPRRs on ongoing ADB-\nfinanced, administered, and supported projects, to assess compliance \nwith applicable policies, guidelines, and the financing agreement. The \nfocus is to prevent and detect integrity violations. OAI also conducts \nfollow-up reviews to assess implementation progress of the PPRR \nrecommendations. Project teams should consult OAI to help identify \nand analyze project procurement risks that may lead to integrity ", "22 Appendix 2\nviolations. PPRR reports can be accessed through http://www.adb.org/\nsite/integrity/project-procurement-related-review.\n(iv) Reports by ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department. In some \ncases, there may also be reports prepared by ADB\u2019s Independent \nEvaluation Department on the performance of specific ADB-financed \nprojects in countries that identify procurement-related issues, which \nmay be useful to review as part of the initial assessment. \n(v)  Country Portfolio Review Mission (CPRM) Report: The purpose \nof the annual CPRM is to review the overall performance of the \nportfolio in terms of completing the projects within the approved time \nand budget, as well as their contributions to sector outcomes and \noutputs. The CPRM (i) examines country-specific common project \nimplementation problems and constraints, and works out appropriate \nremedial measures; (ii) reviews projects with the executing agencies \nand proposes solutions for specific problems being encountered; \n(iii) undertakes field visits to selected problem projects to assess \nthe magnitude and effects of identified problems; and (iv) agrees \non a time-bound action plan with quantifiable monitoring targets \nto remedy or improve the performance of the portfolio. The CRPM \nreport and the mission\u2019s back to office report should be reviewed to \nidentify potential procurement risks.\n(vi) Procurement Committee Decisions: Decisions by ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Committee relating to transactions involving executing \nand implementing agencies in ADB\u2019s priority sectors should be \nreviewed. Key messages and/or findings may indicate possible \nweaknesses in country and/or sector procurement practices.\n(vii) e-Procurement Assessments: ADB initiates assessments of \ne-procurement systems to determine their acceptability for use in \nADB-financed projects. The purpose of the assessment is to ensure \ncompliance of the executing agency\u2019s e-procurement system with the \nmultilateral development bank e-procurement guidelines and to ensure \nthat the system complies with ADB\u2019s 2017 procurement regulations.\n(viii) Project Completion Reports: Project completion reports may \ncontain lessons learned and recommendations about procurement of \ncompleted projects. \n3.  Application of the Country Procurement Assessment Tool\nA2.6  The initial country assessment identifies additional information required \nto complete the CSPRA, and determines the resources required to collect the \ninformation and the most appropriate means by which to undertake the field work.\nA2.7  The information gathered from literature review and ADB\u2019s experience \nwill be used to answer basic questions about a country\u2019s public procurement \nenvironment in terms of policies, rules, regulations, and institutions at the \nnational level, allowing ADB to identify primary areas in variance with ADB\u2019s core \nprocurement principles. The initial country assessment will result in a preliminary \nscore for each of the indicators, an average score for each of the four pillars, and a ", "Appendix 2 23\ntotal average score for the country. The scores will indicate the level of maturity in \ncountry procurement systems.\nA2.8  The country procurement assessment tool and scoring guide are given in \nAppendix 4 and assess the legislative and regulatory framework governing public \nprocurement, the institutional framework and management capacity, procurement \noperations and market practices, and the integrity and transparency of public \nprocurement systems. The tool also allows for an assessment of the gaps in \ninformation or where information is dated, and includes some questions pertaining \nto e-procurement and verification or updating that may be required during the \nCSPRA.\nA2.9  Since there is increasing interest among ADB\u2019s developing member \ncountries to use electronic government procurement (e-GP), it is necessary \nto assess the maturity of e-GP systems in a country as part of the country \nprocurement risk assessment. The assessment of e-GP systems should be \nundertaken with reference to the Guidance Note on E-Procurement.\n4.  Market Risk Assessment \nA2.10  For each country and sector/agency assessed, a market assessment \nneeds to be conducted to cover relevant product/service markets and any cross-\ncutting market risks, including on domestic supply opportunities, foreign supply \nopportunities, access to finance and securities, supply chain constraints, application \nof domestic preferences, restrictions on foreign bidders, licensing, registration, etc.\n5.  Terms of Reference\u2014Country and Sector/Agency Procurement \nRisk Assessment\nA2.11  The terms of reference will guide the country and sector/agency \nassessments. At a minimum, the mission would (i) confirm the findings of the \ninitial country procurement assessment, updating information gaps and narrative \ndescription of the country procurement systems, where necessary, including the \nuse of e-GP systems; (ii) assess sector procurement performance; (iii) assess \ncountry and sector/agency procurement risks and identify mitigating measures \n(i.e.,\u00a0prepare the P-RAMP); and (iv) prepare the CSPRA report. Appendix 5 gives \nan\u00a0indicative terms of reference.\n6.  Country Considerations\nA2.12  When planning a CSPRA, consideration should be given to achieving an \nacceptable level of comfort in the most cost-effective manner. Depending on the \nsize of the country, the level of decentralization, the geographic focus of ADB\u2019s \nforward program, and/or the size of ADB\u2019s program in a given sector, a modified \napproach to CSPRA may be warranted. For example:\n(i)  For large developing member countries, particularly when ADB\u2019s \nprogram has a geographic concentration or with a high degree ", "24 Appendix 2\nof decentralized government services (including procurement), \nconsideration should be given to subnational procurement \nassessments.\n(ii)  For smaller programs, with limited loan or grant financing, it may \nbe more appropriate to conduct the sector/agency procurement \nassessment as part of project processing.\n(iii) For larger programs, or with dominant sector agencies, the sector \nassessments may be best conducted at the agency level, rather than \naggregated at the sector level.\n(iv) If ADB loan- and grant-financed operations are focused on a \nsubsector, then it may be more appropriate to conduct the sector/\nagency assessment at the level of that subsector.\n(v)  Fragile or conflict-affected situations require specific consideration, \nnot only with respect to how to assess country, sector, and/or agency \nprocurement risks, but also with how to identify opportunities for \nproviding additional flexibility that may be needed to enable effective \nproject implementation.1  \n7.  Communicating with the Government\nA2.13  Once the planning has been completed, the ADB team should arrange \nfor the assessment with the concerned client government and key sector agencies. \nConsideration should also be given as to the level of involvement of government \ncounterparts and other development partners.\nB.   Conducting the Assessment: Confirm the Country \nProcurement Assessment and Complete the  \nSector/Agency Procurement Assessments\nA2.14  The in-country assessment will involve discussions with relevant \nstakeholders, including the government, development partners, pertinent local \nindustries, and civil society organizations that are active in ADB\u2019s key sectors. The \nin-country assessment will update and verify the information gathered during the \ndesk review and assess sector/agency procurement performance.\nA2.15  Appendix 6 gives the sector/agency questionnaire and scoring guide. \nThe tool should be applied to each of the sectors assessed to determine the \ndegree of variability in procurement capacity across sectors and as compared \nto the expectations embodied in the national procurement systems. The sector \nassessment template includes a questionnaire that should be used when \nconducting interviews and a scoring guide. The sector score should reflect the \naverage score across agencies. The questionnaire should be used by the assessor. \nIt\u00a0is not designed as a self-assessment tool.\n1   For further information, refer to: (i) the Guidance Note on Fragile, Conflict-Affected, and \nEmergency Situations, and (ii) ADB. 2012.

Manila.", "Appendix 2 25\nA2.16  The results are analyzed and form the basis for completing the narrative \nassessment of the country and sector/agency procurement systems. Appendix 7 \ngives an annotated outline for the CSPRA report.\nA2.17  For the country, and for each priority sector assessed, the report \nshould cover the description of the procurement systems (at the country level) \nand procurement practices (at the sector or agency level); the strengths of the \nprocurement systems or practices (generally these would include areas with a score \nof 2 or 3 on average) and any weaknesses identified (generally these areas would \nhave a score of 0 or 1 on average).\nC.   Determining the Risk Classification\nA2.18  The potential weaknesses in country procurement systems and sector/\nagency procurement practices identified in the CSPRA are further examined to \ndetermine the extent to which these weaknesses pose risks to projects financed in \nwhole or in part by an ADB loan or grant, or by ADB-administered funds.\nA2.19  The first step is to identify the potential risks that have emerged from the \nassessments. Appendix 8 gives a list of indicative procurement risks at the country \nand sector/agency level.\nA2.20  Weaknesses identified in the CSPRA may require the gathering of \nadditional information to determine the root cause of the weakness and how it may \nresult in a risk. Table A2 gives an example of how to convert an identified weakness \ninto a potential risk.\nTable A2: Example of How a Procurement Weakness May Convert to a Risk\nWeakness Key sector agencies use direct selection as the default \nprocurement method\nRisk Bidders without adequate qualifications and capacity \nare\u00a0selected\nPotential Impact Lack of transparency, procurement delays, increased prices, \nreduced quality, reduced life span of assets procured, \nreputational risks\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\nA2.21  Once risks have been identified, it is necessary to assess them to \ndetermine whether the risk is likely to occur and, if it were to occur, the likely impact \nit could have on ADB loan and grant operations. Risks must be prioritized according \nto risk rating and treatments identified to mitigate and manage them. Section IV of \nthis guidance note gives more detail on how to assess risks and develop treatment \noptions.", "26 Appendix 2\nA2.22  If an e-procurement system is used in the country (or by specific \nexecuting agencies), the risk assessment should denote if this has helped in the \nmanagement of procurement risks. The current scope and plans to further improve \nthe e-procurement system should be clearly mentioned. The report should \nalso mention risks related to e-procurement use, if any, and how they are to be \nmitigated.\nA2.23  Once the risks have been identified and categorized, and mitigation \nmeasures identified, the P-RAMP is prepared. The risks should be disaggregated \nbetween the country level and the specific sector/agency level, with overall risk \nratings given for both the country and individual sectors assessed. Appendix 9 gives \nthe standard template.\nA2.24  The final step of risk assessment is to determine the overall country \nprocurement risk and the overall procurement risk in each of the core sectors/\nagencies reviewed. The overall risks should be rated as extreme, high, medium, or \nlow and are reflected in the P-RAMP. In considering the overall rating, the assessor \nconsiders the cumulative impact of the risks identified and the likelihood of that \nimpact occurring. This requires professional judgment and should not simply be a \nstraight average of individual risk ratings.", "Appendix 3: Country Procurement \nData\u00a0Sheet\nA3.1  Procurement data may be obtained from relevant government agencies, \ntheir statistics bureau, or published reports. Practices may vary from one country to \nanother. For projects financed in whole or in part by an Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) loan or grant, or by ADB-administered funds, procurement data should be \nobtained from the relevant executing and implementing agencies. Certain data may \nalso be available from ADB\u2019s Loan and Grant Financial Information Services and \nits Procurement Review System. Data should be taken from at least the last 2 or 3 \nyears to ensure meaningful analysis. \nA3.2  Data obtained by the assessor should be prepared using Table A3. \nMore columns may be added, as necessary, subject to the assessor\u2019s professional \njudgement. One table should be produced for each sector or agency assessed. The \ncompleted table(s) will be annexed to the report. Other data or information used \nshould also be attached to the report.
