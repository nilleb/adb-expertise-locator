These replace the former Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) and Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). The procurement policy and the \nprocurement regulations address the procurement activities of project executing \nagencies and implementing agencies on projects financed in whole or in part by a \nloan or grant from ADB, or by ADB-administered funds. ADB designed the 2017 \nprocurement policy to deliver significant benefits and flexibility throughout the \nproject procurement cycle, as well as to improve project delivery through a renewed \nfocus on the concepts of quality, value for money (VFM), and fitness for purpose.\n\nThis note is part of a series of guidance notes published by ADB in 2018 to \naccompany the 2017 procurement policy and the procurement regulations. \nEach\u00a0note discusses a topical issue for borrowers (including grant recipients), \nbidders, and civil society under the new framework (see list below). The guidance \nnotes cross-reference each other frequently and should be read in conjunction. \nAll\u00a0references to \u201cguidance notes\u201d pertain to these notes.

VFM is part of a holistic procurement structure \nwith three support pillars: efficiency, quality, and flexibility. The two key principles of \ntransparency and fairness weave across all elements of the structure.\n\nT r a n sparency\n\nValue for Money\nThe effective, efficient, and economic use of resources,  \nwhich requires an evaluation of relevant costs and benefits along  \nwith an assessment of risks, nonprice attributes, and/or total cost  \nof ownership as appropriate\n\nEfficiency\n\nQuality\n\nFlexibility\n\n\u2022\tDecreased transaction \n\n\u2022\tContract management \n\n\u2022\tOpen competitive \n\ncosts\n\nsupport\n\n\u2022\tIncreased skills\n\u2022\tIncreased high-level \ntechnology usage\n\n\u2022\tImproved \n\nprocurement planning\n\n\u2022\tPrompt resolution of \n\ncomplaints\n\n\u2022\tImproved developing \n\nmember country \nprocurement process \n\n\u2022\tSupport and \n\n\u2022\tImproved \n\nencouragement \nof e-procurement \nsystems\n\nprocurement planning\n\n\u2022\tGovernance\n\u2022\tContracts with clear \nperformance criteria\n\u2022\tMinimal number of \n\ncomplaints\n\n\u2022\tImproved ADB \n\nprocesses \n\nFairnes s\n\nbidding\n\n\u2022\tDecentralization\n\u2022\tAccreditation \nfor alternative \nprocurement \narrangements\n\u2022\tPrinciples-based \n\ndecisions\n\u2022\tImproved \n\nprocurement planning\n\n\u2022\tDelegation\n\u2022\tBids with weighted  \n\nproposal  \ncriteria \n\nTime\n\nTime is an important element of VFM. When a project is delivered promptly or when a \nprocess is completed rapidly, greater value is created for all stakeholders. For example, a \nroad project completed early provides economic benefit, security, or other value to the \ncommunity it serves. It increases the return on investment to the executing agency and \naccelerates the project and payment cycle to the successful bidder. Likewise, a project \ndelivered late loses significant value. \n\nWhen considering VFM in the context of procurement, pay attention to anything \nthat (i)\u00a0shortens the procurement cycle time frame or (ii) accelerates delivery of the \ndevelopment project.\n\n\fAbout This Publication\n\nix\n\nObjective\n\nThis guidance note is intended to assist readers by elaborating on and explaining  \nADB\u2019s 2017\u00a0procurement policy and procurement regulations for borrowers \n(including grant\u00a0recipients). \n\nThis note identifies additional information for the reader to consider when applying ADB\u2019s \nprocurement policy and procurement regulations to their circumstances. \n\nLiving Document\n\nThis guidance note is intended to be a living document and will be revised as required.\n\nBe sure to check the ADB Business Center website for the latest version and updates,  \nhttps://www.adb.org/business/main.\n\nThe Reader \n\nIn many circumstances, readers are expected to use this guidance note in a manner unique \nto their needs. For consistency throughout the suite of guidance notes, the following \nassumption is made about the reader:\n\nThe reader is a professional involved in activities financed in whole or in part by an ADB loan \nor grant, or by ADB-administered funds. \n\nFAQs\n\nFrequently asked questions, clarifications, examples, additional information, links to training, \nand other useful resources will be made available on the ADB website. \n\nBe sure to check the ADB Business Center website for more information,  \nhttps://www.adb.org/business/main.\n\nLegal and Order of Priority\n\nThis guidance note explains and elaborates on the provisions of the Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers: Goods, Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting Services \n(2017, as amended from time to time) applicable to executing (and implementing) agencies \nunder sovereign (including subsovereign) projects financed in whole or in part by an \ninvestment loan from ADB (i.e., excluding ADB results- or policy-based loans),  \nADB-financed grant (excluding ADB-administered technical assistance and staff \nconsultancies), or by ADB-administered funds. \n\nIn the event of any discrepancy between this guidance note and the procurement \nregulations, the latter will prevail. The financing agreement governs the legal relationships \nbetween the borrower and ADB.

The purpose of risk \nmanagement is to minimize impacts on project objectives from adverse events. \nThe guidance note describes how risks are identified, assessed, and managed at \nthe country and sector/agency levels, and how those risks are used as inputs into \nthe identification, assessment, and management of risk at the project level during \nprocurement planning and through contract implementation.\n\nThe procurement risk framework emphasizes the need to treat and manage \nrisks after identification and highlights risk management as an ongoing activity. \nAssessments and risk treatments need to be updated on a continuous basis, as risks \nchange and new risks are identified.\n\nEffectively identifying and mitigating procurement-related risks may\n\nIncrease Efficiency and Reduce Procurement Time\n\nThe procurement risk framework describes how the outputs of risk \nassessments are used as inputs into risk assessment at subsequent stages, \nthereby ensuring continuity in the risk management process and precluding \nthe need to develop each successive assessment from the beginning.\nEffective risk management reduces the probability of project delays.\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nReduce Risk\n\nThe procurement risk framework describes the process for assessing risks \nand treatment options, enabling risks to be mitigated.\n\nDeliver Value for Money\n\n\u2022\t Value for money and risk are intrinsically linked. Effective management \nof risk leads directly to enhanced value for money and ultimately to an \nincreased likelihood of achieving project objectives.\n\n\fI.\u2003Introduction\n\nThis guidance note describes the procurement risk framework of the \n\n1.1 \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) for managing procurement risk throughout the \nprocurement cycle from country partnership strategy to contract closeout. The \npurpose of risk management is to minimize the impacts of possible adverse events \non achievement of the objectives of a project financed in whole or in part by an \nADB loan or grant, or by ADB-administered funds.\n\n1.2 \nThe procurement risk framework describes how risks are identified, \nassessed, and managed at the country and sector/agency levels and how those risks \nare used as inputs into the identification, assessment, and management of risk at \nthe project level.\n\nThe framework emphasizes the need to treat and manage risks \n\n1.3 \nafter identification and highlights that risk management is an ongoing activity. \nAssessments and risk treatments need to be updated on a continuous basis as risks \nchange and new risks are identified.\n\nThe framework is principles-based and not compliance-based, in line \n\n1.4 \nwith the ADB Procurement Policy: Goods, Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting \nServices (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for \nADB Borrowers: Goods, Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting Services (2017, as \namended from time to time). This approach supports ADB\u2019s core procurement \nprinciples of economy, efficiency, fairness, transparency, quality, and value for \nmoney (VFM).\n\nRisk management and VFM are closely linked. Figure 1 describes how \n\n1.5 \nVFM depends on quality, cost, and sustainability, with each of these aspects \nincorporating the components listed. Adverse impacts to any of these three aspects \ncan adversely impact VFM:\n\n(i)  An increase in the cost of a procurement or project directly \n\nimpacts VFM, if it is not associated with improvements in quality or \nsustainability.\n\n(ii)  Lower quality adversely impacts VFM, if it is not associated with \n\ncompensating reductions in cost.\n\n\f2\n\nProcurement Risk Framework\n\nFigure 1: Risk Management\u2019s Contribution to Value for Money\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\nQualityCostSustainabilityRiskManagementValue for money\u2022Buildability\u2022Functionality\u2022Maintainability\u2022Operability\u2022Purchase cost\u2022Life cyle costs\u2022Schedule\u2022Environment\u2022Safety\u2022Probity\u2022Economic development\u2022Local procurement\f Introduction\n\n3\n\n(iii)  Adverse sustainability outcomes, such as environmental pollution or \npoor project or operational safety, have either direct or downstream \nimpacts on VFM. Even if quality and cost objectives are met, achieving \nthese at the cost of damage to the environment compromises VFM. \n\nRisk management is an essential part of the ADB procurement cycle \n\n1.6 \nbecause it ensures that risks to quality, cost, and sustainability are identified and \nmitigated so that VFM and project objectives are more likely to be achieved. \nFigure\u00a02 shows the ADB procurement cycle. \n\nFigure 2: The ADB Procurement Cycle\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\nPROCUREMENTCYCLEFairnessValue forMoneyQualityEfficiencyEconomyTransparencyProject ConceptualizationProcurement Planning Procurement PlanProject Procurement Risk Assessment Project Administration ManualTransaction Technical Assistance Procurement Risk CategorizationBidding DocumentsContract AwardContract Management PlanFeedback or EvaluationImplementation andContract ManagementProject Completion ReportContract Close Lessons LearnedCountry Partnership StrategyCountry and Sector/Agency Procurement Risk AssessmentBid EvaluationEvaluation ReportsBidding\fII.\u2003Purpose\n\n2.1 \nframework and explain how it is applied at each stage of the procurement cycle.\n\nThe purpose of this guidance note is to present ADB\u2019s procurement risk \n\nThe procurement risk framework applies to different entity/organizational \n\n2.2 \nlevels (country, sector/agency, and project) and to each stage of the project life \ncycle\u2014a continuous process that cascades through the project and procurement \ncycles.\n\nThe borrower (or grant recipient) and ADB are responsible for managing \n\n2.3 \nrisk at different stages of the procurement cycle, and they need to work together \nto ensure that risks are identified and managed effectively.

These inputs are \nused to assist in the identification of risks at each stage. Risks are then assessed \nin terms of likelihood and consequence. The output of the risk assessment \nprocess is the identification and implementation of measures to mitigate the \nrisks. Implementation of the mitigation measures happens via the measures being \nassigned to the appropriate party to action as required. Progress on the mitigation \nmeasures should be monitored on a continuous basis to ensure that they are \nimplemented and effective. Finally, risk assessments should be updated to reflect \nany changes to risks or any new risks.\n\nB.  \n\nThe Procurement Risk Framework Applies \nat\u00a0Different Organizational/Entity Levels\n\nThe procurement risk framework applies at the country, sector/agency, \n\n3.5 \nand project levels.

At this time, a country and sector/\nagency procurement risk assessment (CSPRA) is developed, identifying risks at \nthe country and sector/agency levels. The CSPRA assesses the legislative and \nregulatory framework governing public procurement, the institutional framework \nand management capacity, procurement operations and market practices, and the \nintegrity and transparency of public procurement systems.\n\nAt the project conceptualization stage, the procurement risk is \n\n3.7 \ncategorized as either risk category \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d by ADB, and this categorization is \nused to determine the level of involvement of ADB procurement resources in the \npreparation of the project.\n\nThe project procurement risk assessment (PPRA) is undertaken during \n\n3.8 \nthe procurement planning stage and considers the particular risks associated \nwith the project along with more detailed information about the supply market. \nThe Guidance Note on Strategic Procurement Planning discusses the PPRA \nprocess\u00a0further.\n\nThe contract management plan (CMP) is the risk management tool used \n\n3.9 \nto ensure that procurement risks applicable at the implementation and contract \nmanagement stage are effectively managed. The Guidance Note on Contract \nManagement discusses the CMP further.\n\nThe borrower and ADB are responsible for different risk management \n\n3.10 \nactivities throughout the procurement and need to work together to ensure \nthat risks are identified and managed effectively. While the borrower is directly \nresponsible for such actions, ADB has a fiduciary responsibility to ensure risks are \nidentified and managed within country and sector strategies, and at agency and \nproject levels. Table 2 outlines the responsibilities of ADB and the borrower with \nrespect to risk management.\n\n3.11 \nAt the procurement planning stage, while the borrower is responsible for \ndirect actions, ADB will provide the borrower with relevant information and inputs \nthat can be used by the borrower in developing the procurement plan. ADB will \ncarry out the PPRA to identify potential risks associated with the project, assess the \nlevel of risks, and propose mitigation measures. \n\n\fThe Procurement Risk Framework\n\n9\n\nTable 2: Responsibilities for Risk Management in the Procurement Cycle\n\nAllocation of Responsibilities\n\nProcurement Cycle \nStage\n\nRisk Management \nTool\n\nAsian Development \nBank\n\nBorrower\n\nCountry Partnership \nStrategy\n\nCountry and Sector/\nAgency Procurement \nRisk Assessment\n\nProject \nConceptualization\n\nProcurement Risk \nCategorization\n\nResponsible\n\nConsulted\n\nResponsible\n\nConsulted\n\nProcurement \nPlanning\n\nImplementation \nand Contract \nManagement\n\nProject Procurement \nRisk Assessment\n\nContract \nManagement Plan\n\nAccountable\n\nResponsible\n\nConsulted\n\nResponsible\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\nD.  \n\nThe Procurement Risk Framework Is Continuous \nand\u00a0Cascades through the Procurement Cycle\n\nRisk management begins at the CPS stage and cascades through \n\n3.12 \nthe procurement cycle.

Each risk assessment builds on \nthe previous risk framework stage and is supplemented with additional information \nas the focus of the assessment becomes more targeted toward the project.\n\n3.13 \n\nFigure 3 shows that the CSPRA is produced using, among others \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\ninputs of previous CSPRAs;\nliterature review (such as reviews based on the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development\u2019s \u201cMethodology for \nAssessing Procurement Systems,\u201d assessments completed following \nthe Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability framework, and \ninternet search); and\n\n(iii)  review of relevant ADB data (including information such as country \n\nprocurement data and project procurement-related reviews by ADB\u2019s \nOffice of Anticorruption and Integrity). \n\nIn turn, the project procurement risk categorization conducted at the \n\n3.14 \nproject conceptualization stage uses the CSPRA as an input and results in a \nprocurement risk category for the project.\n\n3.15 \nIn procurement planning, the CSPRA and the procurement risk category \nare inputs into the PPRA, along with an external (including market) analysis and an \ninternal requirements analysis. The outputs are the PPRA, a project procurement \nrisk register, possibly a stakeholder communication plan, and a procurement \nstrategy and plan.\n\n\f10\n\nProcurement Risk Framework\n\nThe PPRA, procurement risk register, stakeholder communication plan, \n\n3.16 \nand procurement strategy and plan are inputs into the CMP, which is used to \nmanage risk during contract implementation.\n\nAt each stage of the procurement risk framework, the focus narrows, \n\n3.17 \nand the risks from the previous stage are filtered for relevance to the current \nassessment. For instance, in developing the PPRA, the focus narrows from country \nand sector to agency and project, and only those risks in the CSPRA that impact the \nproject are considered for inclusion in the PPRA.\n\nE.  \n\nRisks Must Be Managed after Identification\n\nAn important point emphasized in this guidance note is that simply \n\n3.18 \nidentifying and assessing risks is not sufficient. To reduce risks to an acceptable \nlevel, mitigating measures must be identified that are effective in reducing the \nrisk, and these measures must be implemented. To ensure that the measures are \nimplemented, progress of implementation of the measures needs to be monitored \nand managed.\n\n3.19 \nmitigation actions should be documented in a risk assessment document.\n\nTo enable the monitoring and management of mitigation measures, \n\n3.20 \nRisk management is not a one-time exercise. Following the initial \nrisk assessment, risks may change or new risks may become apparent. The \nrisk assessment should be updated in response to changed conditions, or new \ninformation on risks, and at key points in the procurement process to ensure that \nrisks are effectively managed.\n\nFigure 5 describes how risks identified in the PPRA and during \n\n3.21 \nprocurement planning are managed through bidding and contract award to \ncontract implementation.\n\nRisks identified in the PPRA are managed through the selection of \n\n3.22 \nprocurement arrangements, e.g., the procurement method, contract structure, \ncontract terms and performance measures, and other mitigating actions. Mitigating \nmeasures and action owners should be documented in the PPRA and any \nassociated risk register and/or stakeholder communication plan.\n\nAs the project progresses to the bidding stage, the PPRA and risk \n\n3.23 \nregister should be reviewed considering any new information coming out of the \nbid responses that impacts on the risks or mitigation measures. For example, \nbid clarifications may include changes to specifications and bidder structure \nnot initially anticipated, which may require additional measures to mitigate \nimplementation risks.\n\n3.24 \nPPRA should be included in the CMP, along with mitigation actions and action \n\nFollowing bid evaluation and contract award, relevant risks in the updated \n\n\fThe Procurement Risk Framework\n\n11\n\nFigure 5: Risk Management through Planning, Bidding, and Implementation\n\nCMP = contract management plan, PPRA = project procurement risk assessment.\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\nowners. In addition, the CMP should include any other risks (and mitigating \nactions) relevant to contract implementation that were not included in the \nPPRA. The risks and mitigating actions in the CMP then need to be monitored \nby the borrower to ensure they are implemented and effective. This can be done \nby including review of the CMP risk register as a standing item in the contract \nmanagement meetings with the contractor(s). Any changes to risks or any new risks \nidentified should be reflected in the risk register.\n\nProcurement PlanningBidding and AwardContractImplementationRisk Identi\ufb01cationRiskManagementEconomyEfficiencyFairnessTransparencyQualityValue for MoneyProject procurement risk assessment identi\ufb01es and assesses procurement risks through the bid process, and implementationMitigation measures speci\ufb01edRisks are managed via the procurement arrangements (i.e., procurement method, contract structure, contract terms, performance measures, etc.)Risk registerStakeholder communication planCMP takes risks from the revised PPRA that are to be managed during contract implementation, and the corresponding mitigation measuresContract management includes monitoring and managing risks in the CMP and any other issues or risks that occur during implementationPPRA revised to re\ufb02ect any new or altered risks or risk mitigations arising as a result of bid responsesIdenti\ufb01cation of any new risks that arise during contract implementation\fIV.\u2003Risk Assessment and Treatment\n\n4.1 \nconsidered.\n\nAfter risks have been identified, they need to be assessed and treatments \n\nA.   Assessing Risks\n\n4.2 \n\nRisk assessment involves the following steps:\n\n(i)  estimating the likelihood of the risk being realized,\n(ii)  estimating the consequence of the risk being realized,\n(iii)  determining the risk rating, and\n(iv)  prioritizing risks for treatment. \n\nThe risk likelihood table in Appendix 1 should be used to estimate the \n\n4.3 \nlikelihood of the risk being realized, ranging from \u201cRare\u201d to \u201cAlmost Certain.\u201d A risk \nlikelihood score between 1 and 5 should be determined for the risk corresponding \nto the likelihood of the risk occurring.\n\nThe risk consequence table in Appendix 1 should be used to estimate the \n\n4.4 \nconsequence of the risk being realized, ranging from \u201cInsignificant\u201d to \u201cSevere.\u201d \nThe risk consequence table categorizes impacts of risks according to how they \nwould negatively affect the achievement of ADB\u2019s core procurement principles of \neconomy, efficiency, fairness, transparency, quality, and value for money.\n\nThe consequences of the risk being realized should be estimated using \n\n4.5 \nthe most appropriate categories from this list. If a risk has impacts in more than one \nimpact category, the highest rated impact should be recorded. A risk consequence \nscore between 1 and 5 based on the highest rated impact should be determined for \nthe risk corresponding to the consequence of the risk occurring.\n\n4.6 \nThe risk rating should then be determined using the risk rating matrix \nin Appendix 1, using the risk likelihood score and the risk consequence score to \ndetermine a risk rating. For example, a risk with risk likelihood score of 4 (\u201cLikely\u201d) \nand a risk consequence score of 3 (\u201cModerate\u201d) has a risk rating of \u201cHigh\u201d \n(Appendix 1).\n\n4.7 \nRisks should then be prioritized for treatment. Risks rated \u201cExtreme\u201d and \n\u201cHigh\u201d should be given special attention, but treatments to mitigate \u201cMedium\u201d and \n\u201cLow\u201d risks should also be considered as appropriate.\n\n\fRisk Assessment and Treatment\n\n13\n\nB.  \n\nTreating Risks\n\n4.8 \nfour ways described in Figure 6: \u201cavoid,\u201d \u201creduce,\u201d \u201ctransfer,\u201d or \u201caccept.\u201d\n\nFollowing assessment of the risks, each risk should be treated in one of the \n\nFigure 6: Risk Treatment Options\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\nIn some cases, the only available mitigation measure may be \u201cavoidance.\u201d \n\n4.9 \nFor example, immature national procurement systems may be mitigated by \nrequiring ADB standard documents to be used for 100% of contracts financed in \nwhole or in part by an ADB loan or grant, or by ADB-administered funds. \n\nRisk mitigation measures should balance their effectiveness for reducing \n\n4.10 \nthe risk against their costs and effort to implement. Risks rated \u201cExtreme\u201d may \nwarrant additional resources and a specific management plan.\n\nAvoidReduceTransferAcceptAvoid the risk by deciding not to proceed with the project or activity. Transfer the risk to another party, e.g., contract terms, regarding liability and indemnity, insurance, etc.Accept the risk without mitigation. This may occur becauseReduce the likelihood of the occurrence, e.g., procurement approach, contract terms and conditions, contract management activities, quality control manuals, training, etc.Reduce the consequence of the occurrence, e.g., contingency planning, relocation of an activity or operation, etc.the risk rating is so low as to not warrant mitigation,there is no treatment available, and/orthe costs of treatment outweigh the bene\ufb01ts.\fV.\u2003Risk Management in the \nProcurement Cycle\n\nA.  \n\nCountry and Sector/Agency Procurement  \nRisk Assessment\n\nDuring development of the CPS, ADB performs a CSPRA. The CSPRA \n\n5.1 \ngives a broad overview of procurement risks at country and sector/agency level. The \nlevel of the assessment will depend on existing knowledge and on an understanding \nof which sectors/agencies will be involved in projects.\n\n5.2 \nThe CSPRA is carried out periodically, preferably at the same time as CPS \npreparation. However, if significant changes that could materially impact risk ratings \nhave been identified, it may be updated at any time during the CPS period.\n\nThe CSPRA gives information for project concept preparation and \n\n5.3 \nprocurement risk categorization during the project conceptualization stage of \nthe procurement cycle. It also gives critical background information for PPRAs \ndeveloped at the procurement planning stage. Figure 7 describes the process for \nperforming a CSPRA.\n\n5.4 \nCSPRAs typically begin with a planning phase involving a desktop review \nof existing country procurement assessments and experience, and the application \nof a tool to assess country procurement risks. This review is used to develop a field \nwork plan and discussions with the government and other stakeholders.\n\n5.5 \nThe purpose of discussions with the government and other stakeholders is \nto validate the initial country procurement assessment and to assess sector/agency \nrisks for key sectors. Findings are documented in the CSPRA report.\n\nFinally, the weaknesses identified in the CSPRA are converted to risks, \n\n5.6 \nthe risks are assessed, risk treatments are identified, and risks and mitigating \nmeasures are documented in a procurement risk assessment and management \nplan (P-RAMP). The overall country procurement risk is then determined, as is the \noverall sector risk for each key sector.\n\nAppendix 2 gives a detailed description of the CSPRA process, \n5.7 \nincluding references to tools and templates in Appendix 3 to Appendix 9 of this \nguidance\u00a0note.\n\n\fRisk Management in the Procurement Cycle\n\n15\n\nFigure 7: The Country and Sector/Agency Procurement Risk \nAssessment\u00a0Process\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, CSPRA = country and sector/agency procurement risk \nassessment, P-RAMP = procurement risk assessment and management plan.\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\nB.  \n\nProject Conceptualization\n\n5.8 \nAt the project conceptualization stage, an overall project procurement \nrisk category of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d is assigned by ADB. The categorization is used to guide \nproject preparation and due diligence.\n\nA categorization of \u201cA\u201d indicates high risk and will result in active \n5.9 \ninvolvement from the ADB procurement team throughout project preparation and \nprocessing.\n\nThe project procurement risk categorization is a function of (i) the \n5.10 \nprocurement environment in the country and sector (or, where applicable, agency) \nand (ii) project-specific characteristics.\n\n5.11 \nThe first step is to assess the procurement environment risk based on the \ncountry risk and the sector or agency risk applicable to the project, as determined in \n\nPlan the CSPRAConduct the CSPRADetermine Risk Classi\ufb01cation1.Perform initial desktop review2.

It also provides input into \nproject procurement risk categorization during the project conceptualization stage \nof the procurement cycle, and into the development of the project procurement \nrisk assessment (PPRA) at the procurement planning stage. The CSPRA \nincorporates the requirements of the Second Governance and Anticorruption \nAction Plan of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).\n\nA2.2 \n\nThe CSPRA process is described in detail below.\n\nA.  \n\nPlanning the Assessment\n\nADB (or consultants selected by ADB) will conduct the CSPRA. To plan \n\nA2.3 \nthe assessment and determine the resources required, an initial desktop review \nis undertaken based on existing procurement assessments, as well as ADB\u2019s \nprocurement experience in the country and across key sectors.\n\n1. \n\nLiterature Review\n\nA2.4 \nto public procurement systems. This can include, but is not limited to\n\nThe purpose of this step in the process is to identify information relating \n\n(i)  CSPRA Reports Carried Out by ADB: ADB may have carried out \nsuch assessments (or other similar assessments under different \nnames). These reports may be available from the ADB website or \nobtained from relevant ADB departments.\n\n(ii)  Country Procurement Assessment Reports (CPAR): The CPAR was \nthe World Bank\u2019s main instrument to assist its member countries in \nanalyzing their procurement policies, organization, and procedures. \nADB and other development partners regularly participated in the \nCPAR exercise. Publicly available CPARs can be found on the World \nBank website at http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/\ndocsearch/document-type/540617. \n\n(iii)  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, \n\nDevelopment Assistance Committee\u2019s Methodology for Assessing \nProcurement Systems (MAPS): Originally created in 2003\u20132004, \nthe MAPS is intended to provide a common tool to assess the quality \nand effectiveness of procurement systems.\n\n\fAppendix 2\n\n21\n\n(iv)  Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA): The \n\nPEFA Program was founded in 2001 as a multi-donor partnership to \nassess the condition of country public expenditure, procurement, \nand financial accountability systems. The PEFA Framework assesses \na country\u2019s public financial management across 31 indicators, one of \nwhich assesses the procurement monitoring, procurement methods, \npublic access to procurement information, and procurement \ncomplaints management. Publicly available PEFA assessments can be \nfound on the PEFA website: www.pefa.org.\n\n(v)  Internet Search: A variety of bilateral donors and nongovernment \n\norganizations regularly assess public procurement systems, including \nfrom the perspective of fiduciary risk assessment (i.e., the United \nKingdom\u2019s Department for International Development, Revenue Watch, \netc.). A web search on \u201cprocurement fiduciary assessment [country \nname]\u201d should be performed to identify additional secondary sources \nof information. The web search should also include e-procurement \nassessments by various international financial institutions, case studies, \npresentations and/or research papers relevant to the country. \n\n2. \n\nADB\u2019s Procurement Experience\n\nA2.5 \nown experience at the country and sector/agency level should be reviewed:\n\nIn addition to the existing assessments of procurement systems, ADB\u2019s \n\n(i)  Country Procurement Data: The current portfolio of active contracts \nin the country, and priority sectors, is reviewed to identify potential \nrisks. The portfolio is reviewed from the perspective of total number of \ncontracts, contract value, and active contracts, as well as experience \nwith contract variations. Refer to Appendix 3 for data that may be \nneeded for the assessment and potential sources.\n\n(ii)  Existing CPS, Country Assistance Program Evaluation, and/or \nCPS Final Review: The existing CPS and relevant lessons learned \nshould be reviewed to understand better ADB\u2019s operations at the \ncountry level, and sector and thematic priorities. For CPSs prepared \nafter 2008, procurement risk assessment and management plans \n(P-RAMPs) should be available for the country and several priority \nsectors. The quality, completeness, and timeliness of the P-RAMPs \nshould be assessed. It may be useful to review any sector road maps \nprepared in conjunction with the relevant CPS (or CPS update) if the \ncontemplated procurement is targeted for such sectors.\n\n(iii)  Office of Anticorruption and Integrity (OAI) Project Procurement-\nRelated Reviews (PPRRs): OAI conducts PPRRs on ongoing ADB-\nfinanced, administered, and supported projects, to assess compliance \nwith applicable policies, guidelines, and the financing agreement. The \nfocus is to prevent and detect integrity violations. OAI also conducts \nfollow-up reviews to assess implementation progress of the PPRR \nrecommendations. Project teams should consult OAI to help identify \nand analyze project procurement risks that may lead to integrity \n\n\f22\n\nAppendix 2\n\nviolations. PPRR reports can be accessed through http://www.adb.org/\nsite/integrity/project-procurement-related-review.\n\n(iv)  Reports by ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department. In some \ncases, there may also be reports prepared by ADB\u2019s Independent \nEvaluation Department on the performance of specific ADB-financed \nprojects in countries that identify procurement-related issues, which \nmay be useful to review as part of the initial assessment. \n\n(v)  Country Portfolio Review Mission (CPRM) Report: The purpose \nof the annual CPRM is to review the overall performance of the \nportfolio in terms of completing the projects within the approved time \nand budget, as well as their contributions to sector outcomes and \noutputs. The CPRM (i) examines country-specific common project \nimplementation problems and constraints, and works out appropriate \nremedial measures; (ii) reviews projects with the executing agencies \nand proposes solutions for specific problems being encountered; \n(iii) undertakes field visits to selected problem projects to assess \nthe magnitude and effects of identified problems; and (iv) agrees \non a time-bound action plan with quantifiable monitoring targets \nto remedy or improve the performance of the portfolio. The CRPM \nreport and the mission\u2019s back to office report should be reviewed to \nidentify potential procurement risks.\n\n(vi)  Procurement Committee Decisions: Decisions by ADB\u2019s \n\nProcurement Committee relating to transactions involving executing \nand implementing agencies in ADB\u2019s priority sectors should be \nreviewed. Key messages and/or findings may indicate possible \nweaknesses in country and/or sector procurement practices.\n(vii) e-Procurement Assessments: ADB initiates assessments of \n\ne-procurement systems to determine their acceptability for use in \nADB-financed projects. The purpose of the assessment is to ensure \ncompliance of the executing agency\u2019s e-procurement system with the \nmultilateral development bank e-procurement guidelines and to ensure \nthat the system complies with ADB\u2019s 2017 procurement regulations.\n\n(viii) Project Completion Reports: Project completion reports may \n\ncontain lessons learned and recommendations about procurement of \ncompleted projects. \n\n3. \n\nApplication of the Country Procurement Assessment Tool\n\nThe initial country assessment identifies additional information required \n\nA2.6 \nto complete the CSPRA, and determines the resources required to collect the \ninformation and the most appropriate means by which to undertake the field work.\n\nThe information gathered from literature review and ADB\u2019s experience \n\nA2.7 \nwill be used to answer basic questions about a country\u2019s public procurement \nenvironment in terms of policies, rules, regulations, and institutions at the \nnational level, allowing ADB to identify primary areas in variance with ADB\u2019s core \nprocurement principles. The initial country assessment will result in a preliminary \nscore for each of the indicators, an average score for each of the four pillars, and a \n\n\fAppendix 2\n\n23\n\ntotal average score for the country. The scores will indicate the level of maturity in \ncountry procurement systems.\n\nThe country procurement assessment tool and scoring guide are given in \n\nA2.8 \nAppendix 4 and assess the legislative and regulatory framework governing public \nprocurement, the institutional framework and management capacity, procurement \noperations and market practices, and the integrity and transparency of public \nprocurement systems. The tool also allows for an assessment of the gaps in \ninformation or where information is dated, and includes some questions pertaining \nto e-procurement and verification or updating that may be required during the \nCSPRA.\n\nA2.9 \nSince there is increasing interest among ADB\u2019s developing member \ncountries to use electronic government procurement (e-GP), it is necessary \nto assess the maturity of e-GP systems in a country as part of the country \nprocurement risk assessment. The assessment of e-GP systems should be \nundertaken with reference to the Guidance Note on E-Procurement.\n\n4. \n\nMarket Risk Assessment \n\nFor each country and sector/agency assessed, a market assessment \n\nA2.10 \nneeds to be conducted to cover relevant product/service markets and any cross-\ncutting market risks, including on domestic supply opportunities, foreign supply \nopportunities, access to finance and securities, supply chain constraints, application \nof domestic preferences, restrictions on foreign bidders, licensing, registration, etc.\n\n5. \n\nTerms of Reference\u2014Country and Sector/Agency Procurement \nRisk Assessment\n\nThe terms of reference will guide the country and sector/agency \n\nA2.11 \nassessments. At a minimum, the mission would (i) confirm the findings of the \ninitial country procurement assessment, updating information gaps and narrative \ndescription of the country procurement systems, where necessary, including the \nuse of e-GP systems; (ii) assess sector procurement performance; (iii) assess \ncountry and sector/agency procurement risks and identify mitigating measures \n(i.e.,\u00a0prepare the P-RAMP); and (iv) prepare the CSPRA report. Appendix 5 gives \nan\u00a0indicative terms of reference.\n\n6. \n\nCountry Considerations\n\nA2.12  When planning a CSPRA, consideration should be given to achieving an \nacceptable level of comfort in the most cost-effective manner. Depending on the \nsize of the country, the level of decentralization, the geographic focus of ADB\u2019s \nforward program, and/or the size of ADB\u2019s program in a given sector, a modified \napproach to CSPRA may be warranted. For example:\n\n(i)  For large developing member countries, particularly when ADB\u2019s \nprogram has a geographic concentration or with a high degree \n\n\f24\n\nAppendix 2\n\nof decentralized government services (including procurement), \nconsideration should be given to subnational procurement \nassessments.\n\n(ii)  For smaller programs, with limited loan or grant financing, it may \nbe more appropriate to conduct the sector/agency procurement \nassessment as part of project processing.\n\n(iii)  For larger programs, or with dominant sector agencies, the sector \n\nassessments may be best conducted at the agency level, rather than \naggregated at the sector level.\n\n(iv)  If ADB loan- and grant-financed operations are focused on a \n\nsubsector, then it may be more appropriate to conduct the sector/\nagency assessment at the level of that subsector.\n\n(v)  Fragile or conflict-affected situations require specific consideration, \nnot only with respect to how to assess country, sector, and/or agency \nprocurement risks, but also with how to identify opportunities for \nproviding additional flexibility that may be needed to enable effective \nproject implementation.1  \n\n7. \n\nCommunicating with the Government\n\nA2.13  Once the planning has been completed, the ADB team should arrange \nfor the assessment with the concerned client government and key sector agencies. \nConsideration should also be given as to the level of involvement of government \ncounterparts and other development partners.\n\nB.  \n\nConducting the Assessment: Confirm the Country \nProcurement Assessment and Complete the  \nSector/Agency Procurement Assessments\n\nThe in-country assessment will involve discussions with relevant \n\nA2.14 \nstakeholders, including the government, development partners, pertinent local \nindustries, and civil society organizations that are active in ADB\u2019s key sectors. The \nin-country assessment will update and verify the information gathered during the \ndesk review and assess sector/agency procurement performance.\n\nA2.15  Appendix 6 gives the sector/agency questionnaire and scoring guide. \nThe tool should be applied to each of the sectors assessed to determine the \ndegree of variability in procurement capacity across sectors and as compared \nto the expectations embodied in the national procurement systems. The sector \nassessment template includes a questionnaire that should be used when \nconducting interviews and a scoring guide. The sector score should reflect the \naverage score across agencies. The questionnaire should be used by the assessor. \nIt\u00a0is not designed as a self-assessment tool.\n\n1 \n\n For further information, refer to: (i) the Guidance Note on Fragile, Conflict-Affected, and \nEmergency Situations, and (ii) ADB. 2012. Working Differently in Fragile and Conflict-Affected \nSituations\u2013A Staff Handbook. Manila.\n\n\fAppendix 2\n\n25\n\nA2.16 \nThe results are analyzed and form the basis for completing the narrative \nassessment of the country and sector/agency procurement systems. Appendix 7 \ngives an annotated outline for the CSPRA report.\n\nFor the country, and for each priority sector assessed, the report \n\nA2.17 \nshould cover the description of the procurement systems (at the country level) \nand procurement practices (at the sector or agency level); the strengths of the \nprocurement systems or practices (generally these would include areas with a score \nof 2 or 3 on average) and any weaknesses identified (generally these areas would \nhave a score of 0 or 1 on average).\n\nC.  \n\nDetermining the Risk Classification\n\nA2.18 \nThe potential weaknesses in country procurement systems and sector/\nagency procurement practices identified in the CSPRA are further examined to \ndetermine the extent to which these weaknesses pose risks to projects financed in \nwhole or in part by an ADB loan or grant, or by ADB-administered funds.\n\nA2.19 \nThe first step is to identify the potential risks that have emerged from the \nassessments. Appendix 8 gives a list of indicative procurement risks at the country \nand sector/agency level.\n\nA2.20  Weaknesses identified in the CSPRA may require the gathering of \nadditional information to determine the root cause of the weakness and how it may \nresult in a risk. Table A2 gives an example of how to convert an identified weakness \ninto a potential risk.\n\nTable A2: Example of How a Procurement Weakness May Convert to a Risk\n\nWeakness\n\nRisk\n\nPotential Impact\n\nKey sector agencies use direct selection as the default \nprocurement method\n\nBidders without adequate qualifications and capacity \nare\u00a0selected\n\nLack of transparency, procurement delays, increased prices, \nreduced quality, reduced life span of assets procured, \nreputational risks\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\nA2.21  Once risks have been identified, it is necessary to assess them to \ndetermine whether the risk is likely to occur and, if it were to occur, the likely impact \nit could have on ADB loan and grant operations. Risks must be prioritized according \nto risk rating and treatments identified to mitigate and manage them. Section IV of \nthis guidance note gives more detail on how to assess risks and develop treatment \noptions.\n\n\f26\n\nAppendix 2\n\nIf an e-procurement system is used in the country (or by specific \n\nA2.22 \nexecuting agencies), the risk assessment should denote if this has helped in the \nmanagement of procurement risks. The current scope and plans to further improve \nthe e-procurement system should be clearly mentioned. The report should \nalso mention risks related to e-procurement use, if any, and how they are to be \nmitigated.\n\nA2.23  Once the risks have been identified and categorized, and mitigation \nmeasures identified, the P-RAMP is prepared. The risks should be disaggregated \nbetween the country level and the specific sector/agency level, with overall risk \nratings given for both the country and individual sectors assessed. Appendix 9 gives \nthe standard template.\n\nA2.24  The final step of risk assessment is to determine the overall country \nprocurement risk and the overall procurement risk in each of the core sectors/\nagencies reviewed. The overall risks should be rated as extreme, high, medium, or \nlow and are reflected in the P-RAMP. In considering the overall rating, the assessor \nconsiders the cumulative impact of the risks identified and the likelihood of that \nimpact occurring. This requires professional judgment and should not simply be a \nstraight average of individual risk ratings.\n\n\fAppendix 3: Country Procurement \nData\u00a0Sheet\n\nProcurement data may be obtained from relevant government agencies, \n\nA3.1 \ntheir statistics bureau, or published reports. Practices may vary from one country to \nanother. For projects financed in whole or in part by an Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) loan or grant, or by ADB-administered funds, procurement data should be \nobtained from the relevant executing and implementing agencies. Certain data may \nalso be available from ADB\u2019s Loan and Grant Financial Information Services and \nits Procurement Review System. Data should be taken from at least the last 2 or 3 \nyears to ensure meaningful analysis. \n\nData obtained by the assessor should be prepared using Table A3. \n\nA3.2 \nMore columns may be added, as necessary, subject to the assessor\u2019s professional \njudgement. One table should be produced for each sector or agency assessed. The \ncompleted table(s) will be annexed to the report. Other data or information used \nshould also be attached to the report. This may include data on contract variations, \nelapsed time to contract award, levels of competition, number of misprocurements, \nnumber of rebid contracts, number of cancelled contracts, number of complaints, \nand the extent of use of e-procurement systems, among others.\n\n\fTable A3: Procurement Data Table\n\nProcurement \n(Selection) \nMethod/Bidding \nProcedure\n\nContract \nAward \nAmount\n\nContract \nWinner Nationality\n\n28\n\nAppendix 3\n\nName of Sector or Agency:\n\nData Obtained for the Period of: \n\nSource of \nFunds\n\nProject \nName\n\nContract \nDescription\n\nNo.\n\nI.

(ii) assess the severity of the risks; and (iii) develop a practical risk \nmanagement plan to address country and sector/agency procurement risks.\n\nA5.3 \n\nScope: The review team will\n\n(i)  Assess strengths and weaknesses in country procurement systems, \nincluding e-procurement systems, from the perspective of the \nlegal and regulatory framework; the institutional framework and \nmanagement capacity; procurement operations and market practices; \nand integrity and transparency of the public procurement systems, \nincluding the maturity of e-procurement systems in the country.\n(ii)  Assess strengths and weaknesses in sector/agency procurement \n\nsystems and practices from the perspective of the legal and regulatory \nframework; the institutional framework and management capacity; \nprocurement operations and market practices; and integrity and \ntransparency of the public procurement systems.\n\n(iii)  Identify and evaluate procurement and market risks at the country \n\nand sector/agency level.\n\n(iv)  Propose prior and post review (sampling) approaches.\n\n\f38\n\nAppendix 5\n\nC. \n\nApproach and Methodology\n\nA5.4 \n\nThe review will include, but is not limited to\n\n(i)  Validate or update the initial country assessment, primarily through \nconsultation with government counterparts, development partners, \nand other relevant stakeholders using the country tool.\n\n(ii)  Assess sector/agency procurement performance, based on interviews \nwith government counterparts, development partners, and relevant \nstakeholders supported by sampling of specific procurement \ntransactions. The sector/agency tool should be completed for each of \nthe key agencies within the sector, and the average score for the sector \nis then computed.\n\n(iii)  Prepare a narrative description of the country and sector/agency \n\nprocurement systems, including identification of strengths and \nweaknesses.\n\n(iv)  Prepare a narrative description of the market and any risks that this \n\npresents to the envisioned procurement.\n\n(v)  Identify and assess procurement risks, based on risk likelihood and risk \n\n(vi)  Propose risk mitigation or management strategies to address identified \n\nconsequence. \n\nrisks.\n\n(vii) Determine overall country, and where applicable, sector/agency \n\nprocurement risk rating.\n\n(viii) Summarize findings in the CSPRA report, including the maturity of \n\ne-procurement systems in the country.\n\n(ix)  [If applicable] Prepare inputs to the CPS, including the procurement \n\nrisk assessment and management plan (P-RAMP). \n\nD. \n\nKey Deliverables\n\n(i)  CSPRA report.\n(ii)  [If applicable] CPS inputs.\n\n\fAppendix 6: Sector/Agency Procurement \nAssessment Tool\n\nA6.1 \nTable A6.2 describes the scoring guide for this tool.\n\nTable A6.1 describes the sector/agency procurement assessment tool. \n\nTable A6.1: Sector/Agency Assessment Tool\n\nIndicators\n\nSector/Agency Questions\n\n1.

Effective risk management \nminimizes impacts on project objectives from adverse events. The guidance note \ndescribes how risks are identified, assessed, and managed at the country and \nsector/agency levels, and how those risks are used as inputs into the identification, \nassessment, and management of risk at the project level during procurement planning \nand through contract implementation. The procurement risk framework emphasizes \nthe need to treat and manage risks after identification and highlights risk management \nas an ongoing activity.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its \ndeveloping member countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their \npeople. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to a large share of the \nworld\u2019s poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic \ngrowth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, \nequity investments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["PROCUREMENT RISK \nFRAMEWORK\nGUIDANCE NOTE ON PROCUREMENT\n", "JUNE 2018\n", "ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n", "   Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0  \n  IGO license (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 IGO) \n", "\u00a9 2018 Asian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City, 1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nTel +63 2 632 4444; Fax +63 2 636 2444\nwww.adb.org\n", "Some rights reserved.
