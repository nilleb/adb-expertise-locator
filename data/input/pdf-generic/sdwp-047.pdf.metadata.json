Moreover, with rapid unplanned growth, urban areas in many cases retain high socioeconomic \nvulnerability, such as urban poverty, informal settlements, lack of municipal services, land tenure \nissues, etc., which are exacerbated by the exposure to climate-related shocks and stresses. This has \ngiven rise to a growing interest in the concept of urban climate change resilience (UCCR), which \nrecognizes the complexity of rapid urbanization and uncertainties associated with climate change.  \n \nMany development agencies are working closely with their member countries and partners and have \ndeveloped UCCR frameworks. These frameworks highlight that while technology and infrastructure \nare integral to enhancing UCCR, engaging with a wide range of issues (institutional, financial, spatial, \nand social) is  equally essential. Meanwhile, development organizations and researchers are starting to \nlook into practical areas of action to enhance UCCR. Looking across a vast body of literature on urban \nresilience and examples of practice reveals seven entry points for action that, in contextually specific \ncombinations, can strengthen UCCR: \n \n(i)  Generating, sharing, and regularly updating data, information, and knowledge on how \nurban growth interacts or will interact with potential impacts of climate change is a first \nstep for enhancing a city's ability to strengthen UCCR. This includes data on climate \nchange variables, information on exposure of people (specially vulnerable households), \nassets  and  livelihoods,  and  information  on  socioeconomic  vulnerability,  covering \nhousehold  income,  gender,  education,  access  to  basic  services,  access  to  financial \nservices, migration flows, and demographic trends. Much of these data can be collected \nand updated as part of regular urban development processes.  \n(ii)  Forward-looking  urban  planning  tools,  such  as  land  use  planning  and  development \nplanning that allow adopting integrated, inclusive, and reflective approaches, provide a \ncomprehensive  and  sustainable  route  to  enhancing  UCCR.  Actions  would  include \nadopting climate risk-sensitive spatial growth policies for the city, limiting development \nin high-risk areas through the use of development control instruments, and reducing \nphysical vulnerability of assets by strict enforcement of building control. Utilizing urban \nplanning as an entry point for enhancing UCCR draws on existing planning processes, \ntechnical capacity, and resources. \n(iii)  Development processes associated with urban infrastructure and services, including \nwater  and  sanitation,  energy,  transport  and  telecommunications,  ecosystems,  built \nenvironment, and health and social services, can strengthen UCCR by instituting new \nprocesses to ensure their organizational systems support resilience and recognize the \ninterconnections among sectors. Combining structural and nonstructural changes builds \nin robustness, redundancy, and flexibility to cope with shocks and stresses. With large \ninvestments in urban infrastructure and services expected over the next several decades \nin Asia, opportunities for enhancing UCCR remain plenty.   \n(iv)  Individuals and institutions within city governments often know the city intimately, and \nbuilding their capacity is critical for bringing UCCR to life. Capacity building is needed to \nbetter understand the exposure and vulnerability of the population and assets to the \npotential impacts of climate change, as well as to strengthen skills in integrated planning, ", "viii  Executive Summary \nprioritizing  actions,  implementation,  operations  and  maintenance,  and \ninterdepartmental coordination, all with the ultimate objective of introducing behavioral \nchange.   \n(v)  Community  development  processes  that  allow  capturing  diverse  perspectives  of \ncommunities,  especially  the  perspectives  of  the  most  vulnerable,  are  essential  for \nenhancing UCCR. Community-level resilience planning can enhance the capacity of \nmarginalized urban communities to understand the drivers of risk and vulnerability and \nto determine local actions for strengthening resilience.   \n(vi)  There  are  huge  needs  for  and  potential  gains  from  involving  the  private  sector  in \nenhancing  UCCR.  While  governments  can  influence  private  investment  decisions \nthrough planning, incentives, regulation, sharing, and partnerships, the private sector can \nimplement  actions  to  ensure  business  continuity  and  protect  supply  chains  from \nclimate-related shocks and stresses. Companies may also invest in resilience building to \nstabilize  existing  markets  and  develop  new  ones.  They  may  also  help  develop \nmultistakeholder partnerships to tackle resilience. \n(vii)  Catalyzing finance is key to the success of UCCR and includes finances available from \ndifferent scales of governance: microfinance and local development funds; taxes, levies, \nand fines at the city level; earmarked and non-earmarked funding from provincial and \nnational governments; and multilateral, bilateral, and philanthropic funding. Catalytic \naction from a range of actors is essential for ensuring that this available finance is \ngainfully deployed to enhance resilience. \nThese seven entry points need to come together in contextually relevant combinations to strengthen \nUCCR instead of being treated as isolated sectors of activity. Certain cities may have made more \nprogress on some entry points than on others, revealing the need for customized solutions based on \nlocal factors. Over time, and with experience, the entry points may be refined and new ones added.  \n \nHowever, some important challenges remain in maximizing the use of these entry points to enhance \nUCCR. These include challenges related to broader urban governance; understanding the political \neconomy context, navigating the power structures, and dealing with drivers or barriers to change; and \nengaging with the complexities of treating cities as systems. Overcoming such challenges requires \nregular feedbacks between urban systems, the need for action at different scales of governance, and \nthe critical bearing of areas outside the political boundaries of the city. This in turn can influence \noutcomes of UCCR initiatives. \n \n ", " \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n \nBy 2050, the percentage of the world\u2019s population living in cities and towns will grow from 50% to 70%, \nwith middle-income countries in Asia accounting for much of this growth. For example, India is \nexpected to add over 400 million urban dwellers while the People\u2019s Republic of China will increase the \nglobal urban population by 290 million residents by 2050.1 Megacities of 10 million inhabitants or more \nnearly tripled from 10 to 28 during 1990\u20132014, with 14 in the People\u2019s Republic of China and India \nalone (footnote 1). Despite this, close to half of the world\u2019s urban dwellers reside in centers with fewer \nthan 500,000 inhabitants. Furthermore, small (500,000\u20131 million are inhabitants) and medium-sized \n(1 million\u20135 million) cities in Asia are growing the fastest (footnote 1).  \n \n \nFigure 1: Contribution to the Increase in Urban Population by Country,  \n2014\u20132050 \n \n \n \nSource: United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division. 2014.

Globally, almost 1 billion people live in informal settlements, and this number is \nexpected to grow by nearly 500 million from 2013 to 2020.4 Informal settlements have few livelihood \nopportunities, scant basic services, fractured law and order, and improper planning; these factors \ncombined amplify the vulnerability of urban areas. \n \nWith the expected growth in urban population and the volume of investments that will flow into urban \ndevelopment in the coming decades, management of climate change risks will be a critical determinant \nof how urban areas will thrive. These factors have given rise to interest in the concept of urban climate \nchange  resilience  (UCCR).  This  discourse  on  resilience,  which  emerged  during  2001-2010,  was \nprimarily considered an approach to respond to specific shocks (primarily earthquakes; then, in the \nwake of 9/11, security-related shocks).5 The end of the decade 2001-2010 saw the launch of a number \nof climate change resilience-building initiatives, including the Climate Investment Funds\u2019 Pilot Program \nfor Climate Resilience (which includes urban components), Strengthening Climate Resilience Initiative  \nfunded by the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, and the Rockefeller \nFoundation\u2019s Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network (ACCCRN). More recently, other major \ninitiatives such as the Rockefeller Foundation\u2019s 100 Resilient Cities and the Urban Climate Change \nResilience Trust Fund (UCCRTF) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have also gone live. As such, \nthe discourse is now paying greater attention to studying pathways for building resilience to climate \nchange-induced shocks and stresses in urban areas. \n \nThis growing interest in resilience has led to the consolidation of a certain amount of knowledge on \nenhancing UCCR. This paper synthesizes existing knowledge on UCCR to identify entry points for \naction in order to help ADB\u2019s developing member countries, ADB project officers and partners, and \nthe wider urban development community gain a general understanding on entry points for enhancing \nUCCR. It is expected that ADB\u2019s UCCRTF and other similar initiatives in the Asian region will benefit \nfrom the entry points discussed in this paper, and, over time, will refine the existing entry points and \nadd new ones based on experiences.  \n \n \nII.  KEY CONCEPTS \n \nThis section provides a brief overview of the theoretical and analytical concepts that frame the idea of \nUCCR. It first describes the terms that are commonly used to denote the ability to engage with climate \nchange-induced shocks and stresses, and then introduces the key principles and qualities of UCCR.  \n \nA.

Some argue that \u201ca resilient city is one that can \nadapt to\u2026 changing conditions and withstand shocks while still providing essential services to its \nresidents.\u201d7 Others attempt to shift the rather conservative implications of this definition to argue for a \nvision of resilience that includes ideas of taking advantage of opportunities and bouncing back better.\u201d8  \nFor example, \u201cUrban resilience is the capacity of cities to function, so that the people living and \nworking in cities\u2014particularly the poor and vulnerable\u2014survive and thrive no matter what stresses or \nshocks they encounter.\u201d9  \n \nThese definitions of urban resilience further branch out into an understanding of UCCR, which adds \nspecificity to the nature of shocks and stresses and includes those that have hydrometeorological \norigins.  UCCR  embraces  climate  change  adaptation,  climate  change  mitigation,  and  disaster  risk \nmanagement,  while  recognizing  the  complexity  of  rapidly  growing  urban  areas  and  uncertainty \nassociated with climate change.10  \n \n\u201cThis approach places greater emphasis on considering cities as dynamic systems capable of evolving \nand adapting to survive and even thrive in the face of volatile shocks and stresses\u201d (footnote 9). \nSystems thinking helps in working across sectoral silos and engaging with multiple and evolving risks \nsimultaneously.11 This is important because climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity \nwith which climate shocks and stresses occur, rendering historical records alone less effective in \npredicting the future. Crucially, the resilience of a city depends on the overall performance and \ncapacity  of  its  systems,  not  solely  on  its  ability  to  manage  disaster  risk,  reduce  greenhouse  gas \nemissions, or adapt to the impacts of climate change. In fact, UCCR describes a city that is resilient on \nthree levels (footnote 8): \n \n(i)  The city\u2019s systems survive climate-related shocks and stresses. \n(ii)  The people and organizations are able to accommodate climate-related shocks and \nstresses into their daily decisions. \n(iii)  The  city\u2019s  institutional  structures  continue  to  support  the  capacity  of  people  and \norganizations to fulfill their aims.  \n \n                                                                 \n6   C.

Key Frameworks for Urban Climate Change Resilience \n \nA number of frameworks set out the pillars of UCCR (Box 1). While these frameworks spring from \ndifferent organizations operating in different contexts, there is a high degree of convergence on the \nfact that UCCR results from engaging with a wide range of issues. Each of the frameworks also \nhighlights that, while technology and infrastructure are integral to enhancing UCCR, engagement with \norganizational, financial, spatial, social, and institutional issues is equally essential. This acknowledges \nthat \u201ccities are complex systems; and, like all systems, a city depends on the smooth functioning of its \nconstituent elements and the larger organization in which it is nested. A city\u2019s resilience is therefore \naffected by the resilience of those smaller and larger systems\u201d (footnote 7).  \n \n \nBox 1: Key Frameworks for Urban Climate Change Resilience \n \nA. City Resilience Framework, Arup \n \nArup\u2019s City Resilience Framework, developed in partnership with the Rockefeller Foundation, presents a view of what a resilient \ncity looks like and represents an outcome-oriented framework, with 12 outcomes across four different categories (health and \nwell-being, economy and society, infrastructure and environment, and leadership and strategy) and seven additional qualities of \nresilience (integrated, inclusive, resourceful, flexible, redundant, robust, and reflective).a The entry point of this framework is the \nstudy of cities, and, while the authors view resilience as a response to climate change and disasters, they feel the concept can be \ndeployed against a wide range of shocks and stresses. Therefore, in this framework, \u201cresilience\u201d implies an enhancement to city \nsystems' capacity to function in the face of multiple hazards.  \n \nB. City Resilience Framework, Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network  \n \nThe framework developed for the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network, pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation, \nhinges on viewing the city as a sum of interconnected parts that share dynamic relationships and argues that urban systems, \nvulnerable groups, and climate change combine to determine the resilience of a city.b This means that anyone designing or \ndeploying actions to build resilience should consider three key questions:  \n \n(i)  How does the city work?  \n(ii)  What are the direct and indirect impacts of climate change?  \n(iii)  Who is least able to respond to climate-related shocks and stresses?   \n \nA key feature of this approach is that this is specifically about engaging with the direct and indirect risks posed by climate change.  \n \nC. Urban Climate Change Resilience Framework, Institute for Social and Environmental Transition \n \nThe Institute for Social and Environmental Transition approach to conceptualizing urban climate change resilience highlights \nsimilar sets of issues by arguing that urban resilience results from the dynamic interaction of three elements:c \n \n(i)  Systems: infrastructure, ecosystems, water and food supply, energy, transport, shelter, and communications  \n(ii)  Agents: individuals, households, and private and public sector organizations  \n(iii)  Institutions: social rules or conventions that structure human behavior and exchanges in social and economic \ninteractions, including rights and entitlements, decision-making processes (particularly in relation to urban \ndevelopment), and access to information and knowledge \n \nAs such, this approach argues \u201cresilience is high where robust and flexible systems can be accessed by high-capacity agents and \nwhere that access is enabled by supportive institutions.\u201d (footnote c)  \n \n \nSource: Authors. \na   Arup. 2014.

Frameworks  carry  different \nprescriptions on how to achieve this, but almost all underline the importance of involving \na wide variety of stakeholders, including the urban poor and marginalized, in decision \nmaking.  \n(ii)  UCCR practitioners need to understand that the city\u2019s resilience is contingent on higher \nscales of governance, such as at provincial or national levels. This implies that they need \nto understand these cross-scalar linkages and then work to leverage their potential for \neffecting change at the city level.   \n(iii)  This way of understanding the city also necessitates an acknowledgment of how its \nresilience is dependent on areas that may lie beyond its administrative boundaries. Cities \nrely  on  dynamic  flows  of  vital  goods  and  services  from  peri-urban  areas  and  the \nhinterlands that must be factored in when developing a comprehensive approach to \nenhancing UCCR.   \nC.  Guiding Principles of Urban Climate Change Resilience \n \nAchieving resilient outcomes demand that a series of principles are integrated into any UCCR-related \nefforts. Based on experiences of cities, these principles include the following (footnote 9): \n \n\uf0b7  Combining hard and soft measures. Capacities, networks, and behavior (of individuals, \ncommunities, and institutions) are as critical as physical systems during disruption. Soft \nmeasures  include  new  regulations,  technology  and  information  systems,  and  social \nnetworks. \n\uf0b7  Engaging diverse perspectives through multistakeholder processes. Given a city\u2019s \nvaried socioeconomic groups and economic interests, engaging across different sectors \n(government, business, civil society, and academia) and different departments within the \ncity government can bring forth transformative changes. \n\uf0b7  Enlisting  different  geographic  and  governance  scales:  beyond  city  boundaries. \nConsidering  the  interconnectedness  of  markets  and  economies,  it  is  important  to \nunderstand  how  systems  (economic,  physical,  ecological,  and  political)  within  and \nbeyond the city affect how it functions. There is also a need to understand how to best \nenlist stakeholders at different scales. \n                                                                 \n12   B. Ramalingam et al. 2008.

The city\u2019s decision makers often find it difficult to look beyond current challenges, \nparticularly  when  change  is  unpredictable.  Planning  processes  should  begin  by \naddressing the current needs (e.g., water supply or urban drainage). Building on existing \nissues and analyzing how climate change might affect or increase existing hazard risk is \none way to bring future scenarios into current decision making. \n\uf0b7  Tapping into local expertise. Engaging local technical experts (e.g., researchers and \nacademics) enables dialogues to be held on a sustained basis. For example, external \nexperts may be paired with local technical institutions to bridge the quality engagement \ntrade-off and build long-term adaptive planning capacity. \n\uf0b7  Building leadership and local action. Efforts to build resilience are most likely to be \naccelerated  and  sustained  through  strong  leadership,  driving  commitment,  and \naccountability with active community engagement to build awareness. \n\uf0b7  Focusing  on  vulnerable  communities:  Whose  resilience?  The  litmus  test  for  a \nmeaningful  urban  resilience  approach  is  its  relevance  to  the  interests  of  poor  or \nvulnerable households. While resilience measures must be provided at multiple levels, it \nis important to constantly ask \u201cresilience for whom?\u201d to establish their practical value \nand to ensure that equity concerns are kept at the heart of the agenda. \nD.  Qualities of Urban Climate Change Resilience \n \nAs resilience has come to inform development programming, attempts have been made to distill key \nqualities of resilience. The key insights from different experiences have been distilled into seven \noverarching resilience qualities within Arup\u2019s City Resilience Framework.13 These qualities are being \nused to guide the World Bank\u2019s urban resilience agenda and the Rockefeller Foundation\u2019s 100 Resilient \nCities initiative, and have been included in the synopsis of UCCR prepared as part of the ADB\u2019s \nUCCRTF (footnote 9). These qualities include the following:  \n \n\uf0b7  Reflective.  People  and  institutions  systematically  learn  from  experience,  with  an \nadaptive  planning  mind-set  that  accepts  unpredictable  outcomes.  They  have \nmechanisms that continuously modify standards based on emerging evidence, rather \nthan  seeking  permanent  solutions  based  on  an  assessment  of  today\u2019s  shocks  and \nstresses. \n\uf0b7  Robust. Robust systems include well-conceived, constructed, and managed physical \nassets so they can withstand the impacts of hazard events without significant damage or \nloss of function. Robust design anticipates potential failures in systems, making provision \nto ensure failure is predictable, safe, and not disproportionate to the cause. Overreliance \non a single asset, cascading failure, and design thresholds that might lead to catastrophic \ncollapse if exceeded are actively avoided. \n\uf0b7  Redundant. Redundancy refers to spare capacity purposely created within systems so \nthey can accommodate disruption, extreme pressures, or surges in demand. It includes \ndiversity, i.e., the presence of multiple ways to achieve a given need or fulfill a particular \n                                                                 \n13   J. da Silva and B. Morera. 2014. City Resilience Framework. London: Arup. ", "  Enhancing Urban Climate Change Resilience: Seven Entry Points for Action  7 \nfunction. Examples include distributed infrastructure networks and resource reserves. \nRedundancies should be intentional, cost-effective, and prioritized at a citywide scale, \nand should not be an externality of inefficient design. \n\uf0b7  Flexible.  Flexibility  implies  systems  can  change,  evolve,  and  adapt  in  response  to \nchanging  circumstances.  This  may  favor  decentralized  and  modular  approaches  to \ninfrastructure  or  ecosystem  management.  Flexibility  can  be  achieved  through  the \nintroduction of new knowledge and technologies, as needed. It also means considering \nand incorporating indigenous or traditional knowledge and practices in new ways. \n\uf0b7  Resourceful. Resourcefulness implies people and institutions are able to rapidly find \ndifferent ways to achieve their goals or meet their needs when climate change shocks or \nstresses arise. This may include investing in capacity to anticipate future conditions, set \npriorities,  and  respond,  for  example,  by  mobilizing  and  coordinating  wider  human, \nfinancial, and physical resources. Resourcefulness is instrumental to a city\u2019s ability to \nrestore  functionality  of  critical  systems,  potentially  under  severely  constrained \nconditions. \n\uf0b7  Inclusive. Inclusion emphasizes the need for broad consultation and engagement of \ncommunities, including the most vulnerable groups. Addressing the shocks or stresses \nfaced by one sector, location, or community in isolation of others is contrary to the \nnotion of resilience. An inclusive approach contributes to a sense of shared ownership or \na joint vision to build city resilience. \n\uf0b7  Integrated. Integration and alignment between city systems promote consistency in \ndecision making and ensures all investments are mutually supportive to a common \noutcome.  Integration  is  evident  within  and  between  resilient  systems,  and  across \ndifferent scales of their operation. Exchange of information between systems enables \nthem  to  function  collectively  and  respond  rapidly  through  shorter  feedback  loops \nthroughout the city.  \n \n \nIII.  ENTRY POINTS FOR ACTION \n \nThis section discusses seven entry points that have emerged from analysis of the UCCR literature and \nwere validated through interviews with key UCCR experts.14 It describes and outlines each entry point, \nthe  benefits,  the  range  of  practical  actions  to  leverage  the  potential  of  this  entry  point  for \noperationalizing pathways to UCCR, and the challenges of using each entry point.  \n \nMuch of what is considered good development practice\u2014such as strong and equitable economic \ngrowth, rights and entitlements, and wide access to basic services\u2014helps build resilience over time. \nThus, the entry points identified are part of good urban development processes and, when approached \nwith a resilient qualities lens, provide ample opportunities to translate the concept of UCCR into \npractice (Figure 2).  \n                                                                 \n14   Most prominently from Kernaghan and da Silva (who argue that action across four areas is necessary to sustain action on \nUCCR that includes knowledge (entry point 1), planning and policy making (2 and 3), engaging stakeholders (4, 5, and 6), \nand enabling finance (7).

However, a comprehensive approach to building UCCR may best begin \nwith collecting the right information and knowledge, and move on to planning and policy processes, \nstrengthening capacity, engaging with a variety of stakeholders, and accessing finance. Nevertheless, \nsome cities may have more opportunity or made more progress on one entry point over another, which \nshows how some actions may be more important than others in different contexts.  \n \nA.  Entry Point 1: Data, Information, and Knowledge on Urban Growth \nand Climate Change  \n \n \nInforming UCCR actions requires data, information, and knowledge on natural and physical exposure \nand social and economic vulnerability of people and assets to climate change-related shocks and \nstresses.  These  data  cuts  across  administrative  boundaries,  sectors,  and  timescales  to  include \ninformation about past events and performance, current trends, and future projections on climate \nchange and urban growth. Taken together, this information is necessary to determine pathways of \nUCCR and can largely  be collected, shared, and updated as part of regular urban development \nprocesses. \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Enhancing Urban Climate Change Resilience: Seven Entry Points for Action  9 \nKey Points\n \nOpportunities and Benefits \n \n\uf0b7  Urban development processes provide opportunities to collect, share, and update large sets of base data, which \nare critical for understanding the exposure and vulnerability of people, their assets, and livelihoods to potential \nimpacts of climate change. \n\uf0b7  Advancements made in mobile technology and its wide usage, especially in the urban areas, provide opportunity \nto crowdsource information, thereby capturing resilience-related perspectives of the urban population and \nmaking it easier to share and update data. \n\uf0b7  Collecting, sharing, and applying exposure and vulnerability-related data provide opportunities to improve \nintradepartmental coordination and better understanding of interlinkages between sectors, which is a key \nrequirement for urban climate change resilience (UCCR). \n \nActions and Modalities \n \n\uf0b7  Collect three main streams of data for enhancing UCCR: \n\u2013  Climate change data: information on climate variables, their trends, and projections \n\u2013  Exposure data: location and nature of physical assets and environmental resources \n\u2013  Social and economic vulnerability data: household income, gender, literacy level, access to basic services, \naccess to inclusive financial services, migration flows, demographic trends, etc. \n\uf0b7  Use these data in undertaking climate risk and vulnerability assessment, which should inform urban planning, \nproject prioritization, and design of individual UCCR-related investments. \n \nChallenges \n \n\uf0b7  Incorrect interpretations of climate projections that are characterized by uncertainty \n\uf0b7  High financial costs in collecting and maintaining exposure and vulnerability data \n\uf0b7  Disconnect between data collection, sharing, and evidence-based decision making\n \n \n1.  Opportunities and Benefits \n \nClimate  change  will  have  potential  impacts  on  the  assets  and  performance  of  a  wide  range  of \ninterdependent  urban  sectors  (water  and  sanitation,  electricity,  housing,  natural  resource \nmanagement, and transportation); delivery of basic urban services; and emergency management-\nrelated functions of a city government. If any component which forms part of the larger system in a \nsector fails, this could have a domino effect. For instance, failure in the power grid due to a tropical \ncyclone can disrupt water supply and transportation. Moreover, such impacts will be felt differently in \nvarious sections of the urban population, with the poor being most at risk because of their preexisting \nsocioeconomic vulnerabilities.  \n \nThus, as a first step, along with information on climate variables (temperature, precipitation, and \nchanging hazard pattern), it is critical to collect information on factors that would contribute to the \nexposure and vulnerability of the population and assets to the potential impacts of climate change. \nSuch  information  would  include  socioeconomic  data,  geographical  characteristics  of  the  area \n(preferably beyond immediate administrative boundaries), land records, characteristics of various \nphysical assets (e.g., size, shape, occupancy, age, and construction type of public buildings), urban \ngrowth pattern, environmental data, and location of vulnerable population.  \n \nLarge portion of UCCR-relevant data can be collected as part of urban development. A large \nportion of the information required for strengthening UCCR is typically collected by city governments, \n \n ", "10  ADB Sustainable Development Working Paper Series No. 47 \nline agencies, private sector, and research organizations for wider urban development purposes, and \nshould be the starting point to strengthen UCCR. Over time, a geographically referenced spatial \ninformation platform can be developed to regularly collect, analyze, share, and update data toward \nincreasing collective understanding among different sectors and population on how the exposure and \nvulnerability of people and assets will interact with current and future climate-related shocks and \nstresses. Such an approach will improve coordination across agencies and facilitate the development \nof system-wide resilience-building measures.  \n \nHuman and intellectual capital present in cities makes data collection and update easier. Apart \nfrom data and information available from public sources, cities are also important agglomerations of \nhuman and intellectual capital, which can be tapped to generate UCCR-related information. For \nexample, data collection can enlist the support of local communities, particularly those with low \nadaptive capacity but good knowledge of their own subjective resilience and experience of past \nclimate-related hazards.15 Involving local communities and institutions also allows for the incorporation \nof the concerns of more vulnerable groups, which top-down planning processes might not capture. In \naddition, it builds information networks that can assist municipal governments in targeting resilience-\nbuilding efforts. By identifying the various ongoing initiatives and organizations working in community-\nbased development, city officials can create an opportunity to mine their accumulated knowledge and \nextend their capacity for data collection and updating information.  \n \nTechnological advancements provide new cost-effective opportunities to collect and update \ndata. Advancements in technology, such as mobile technologies which have high usage in urban areas, \noffer new opportunities to collate local perspectives on climate change resilience in an efficient, \neconomic, and participatory manner (Box 2). For example, communities can be involved by using their \nmobile phone in collecting geo-referenced data on the location and characteristics of assets, such as \npublic and private schools and hospitals. The engagement of communities has the potential of making \nthem cocreators of data, thereby also supporting the regular update of local level information on \nvulnerability and exposure. \n \n \nBox 2: Harnessing Mobile Technologyto Crowdsource Resilience Data, Jakarta, Indonesia\n \nCities are unique for their high mobile phone service penetration and communication infrastructure. Mobile technologies \ncan be used to crowdsource geo-referenced data, in combination with big data streams to support community-based \ndisaster risk reduction initiatives. Because social media data contain geo-located information, crowdsourcing can produce \nstrategies that respond to infrastructure problems that come along with rapid and unplanned development. The United \nNations Global Pulse led a SMART Infrastructure Facility project in Jakarta, and looked at what big data could contribute \nto small, citizen-generated crowdsourced data. The program analyzed information from a combination of citizen-\ngenerated projects and Twitter, building a picture of flooding across the city as the monsoon season unfolded. The data \nare sourced in real time and mapped, and overlaid with \u201cbig data\u201d sources that help show connectivity between different \ninfrastructure and how these components react to flooding. The pilot was specifically geared toward flood risk, but the \nmethodology could be applied to urban waste and sewage management. It could also help decision makers understand the \nunintended social and economic consequences of infrastructure or construction decisions, preventing maladaptation and \nallowing for iterative learning. \n \n \nSource: G.

Actions and Modalities \n \nClimate-related shocks occur in cities in tandem with an array of environmental, economic, and \npolitical stresses. Assessing how cities will deal with concurrent shocks and stresses requires the \nfollowing actions:  \n \nCollect and analyze climate change\u2013related data. To understand how an urban area could be \naffected  by  potential  impacts  of  climate  change,  data  are  needed  on  past  patterns  and  future \nprojections of climate characteristics\u2014temperature, precipitation, intensity and frequency of climate \nhazards,  sea  level  rise,  etc.  Collection  of  such  data  requires  looking  beyond  immediate  urban \nadministrative boundaries, and close collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders with diverse \nperspectives, including government agencies responsible for climate information, research institutions, \nuniversities, and local experts, thereby encouraging an integrated approach. With advancements in \ntechnology, it is becoming easier to collect data on climate variables, e.g., remote sensing imagery from \nsatellites can be used to understand past flooding patterns. However, uncertainties are inherent in \ndownscaling climate data, especially when modeling the changes in the magnitude and intensity of \nextreme weather events. It is important to appreciate that uncertainties exist and to discuss the \nimplications for the results and decision making.16  \n \nAssess exposure of people and assets. In addition to data on climate variables, data on urban \ncharacteristics and growth are required\u2014topography, changes in land use, characteristics of the urban \npopulation, location and characteristics of formal and informal housing, location and characteristics of \npublic assets, infrastructure and economic activities, location of natural ecosystems, and location of \nvulnerable communities. The climate data are laid over the data on urban characteristics and growth to \nanalyze which aspects of the city's urban system are most likely to be negatively affected.  \n \nExposure data can support in making crucial decisions on enhancing UCCR by understanding how \nclimate-related shocks and stresses  will potentially interact  with demographic trends and spatial \ngrowth strategies of the urban area. Since the projections are based on uncertain socioeconomic \nfutures, the timing, magnitude of potential impacts, and the locations of the most affected by climate \nchange cannot be determined with high precision.17 Here, analogue scenarios can be constructed from \npaleorecords to create plausible scenarios. However, these can only demonstrate futures in which \nsocioeconomic variables remain similar to historic trends.18 \n \nMultiple methods can be used to collect data on exposure: crowdsourced geo-referenced data on \nflooding extent can be collated from social media; information on location and characteristics of \nhousing and physical assets built in hazard-prone areas can be gathered from land use maps; and \nstresses within a community can be obtained using participatory techniques such as transect walks19 \n(Box 3). Such methods will enable inclusiveness and reflectiveness in approaching UCCR. \n \n \n                                                                 \n16   ADB. 2016.

Climate data and climate projections in particular are \nstill characterized by uncertainty. UCCR-related planning and investment decisions may at times \nrequire highly downscaled projections, yet high levels of detail in climate projections do not translate to \nhigh levels of confidence in that detail: estimations are based on different socioeconomic futures, so \ncreating projections with a granular level of geographic detail is near impossible.20 Thus, it is important \nto appreciate that uncertainties exist and to understand the implication of using such information. This \nrequires close collaboration between climate science specialists and urban planners and decision \nmakers. Furthermore, detailed downscaled data may not always be necessary, and resilience actions \ncan be built using regional-level climate predictions without compromising the validity of the method.  \n \nHigh levels of investments in collecting and updating exposure and vulnerability data. Another \nchallenge  is  the  high  levels  of  investment  required  in  collecting  and  updating  exposure  and \nvulnerability data. House-to-house surveys can cover small areas only, and the method is both time-\nconsuming and expensive. However, new methods have harnessed geospatial data to simplify and cut \ncosts for exposure and vulnerability mapping. Also, updated land use maps can determine to a \nsignificant degree the types of buildings, key economic activities, and population density in a particular \narea.  For  instance,  urban  residential,  commercial,  and  industrial  zones  will  display  different \ncharacteristics in terms of building structure, occupancy, and value. Thus, the costs of traditional \nmethods of exposure and vulnerability mapping can be offset by using advanced technology and \ncreatively incorporating such data into a larger database.  \n \nUsing results of climate risk and vulnerability assessments in decision making. Translating data on \nclimate risk and vulnerability into policy, planning, and investment-related decision making remains a \nchallenge, particularly for UCCR, an area in which a broad range of information is needed. Helping \ndecision makers visualize what change means across a variety of climate change and urban growth \nscenarios  and  discussing  adoption  of  no-regret  or  low-regret  local  actions  are  a  good  way  of \novercoming this challenge.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                                 \n20   S.

Opportunities and Benefits \n \nUrban planning regimes aim to provide a comprehensive and longer-term approach to development \nand guide the spatial, social, economic, and cultural development of the city.

The long-term outlook of land use planning (e.g., 10\u201320-year time frame of \nland use plans) provides an opportunity to factor in longer-term risk considerations, such as climate \nchange.  This  is  particularly  important  to  protect  critical  infrastructure  and  public  utilities,  which \ntypically have a longer design life (footnote 16). \n \nUrban planning can help reduce or limit exposure and vulnerability. The spatial nature of land use \nplans allows a demonstration of the locational constraints posed by climate change on existing and \nfuture developments of a city, and guides the adoption of climate-sensitive spatial growth policies. For \nexample, the land use planning process can identify environmental resources and sensitive areas (e.g., \nwetlands, sand dunes, and coastal vegetation) and adopt relevant development control measures \n(such as conservation zoning, and buffers), thus helping to maintain the health of ecosystems that \nprovide basic services, strengthen livelihoods, and enhance social capital, all of which in turn reduce \nvulnerability. At the same time, the city development plans can reduce socioeconomic vulnerability by \ntargeting investments in vulnerable communities, thereby enhancing their resilience. For example, city \ndevelopment plans can prioritize hard and soft investments to enable equal access to education, \nhealth, and financial services, and to strengthen capacity and institutions. \n \n2.  Actions and Modalities \n \nThe approaches for embedding UCCR principles and qualities in urban planning processes can be as \nfollows:  \n \nFactor climate change considerations in different stages of land use planning. The different stages \nof the land use planning process\u2014situation analysis, visioning, goal setting, and development scenario \nanalysis\u2014should incorporate scientific and local knowledge of the potential impacts of climate change \nand  guide  the  development  of  climate-resilient  policies  and  investments.  The  situation  analysis \nprocess, which provides an understanding on current land usage and information about likely future \noccupancy and city expansion rates, should undertake analyses on how the potential impacts of \nclimate  change  will  affect  the  development  suitability  of  the  area  (inside  and  outside  the \nadministrative boundaries) and demand for land, housing, infrastructure, transportation, employment, \nrecreation,  waste  management,  etc.  Also,  the  city  visioning  process,  which  allows  developing \nconsensus among a wide range of stakeholders on the strategic priorities of the city, should be within a \ndefined time frame. Further, it should analyze how current and future climate considerations will affect \nthe realization of the city\u2019s vision and the need to develop explicit climate-resilient land use goals, \nwhere  needed.  Such  climate-sensitive  analysis  undertaken  during  the  land  use  plan  formulation \nprocess will guide the development of a package of policy and hard and soft investment measures and \nthereby contribute to resilience qualities (integrated, inclusive, and resourceful) (footnote 16). \n \nUse  development  control  instruments  to  strengthen  resilience  to  climate  change.  A  key \ncomponent of land use planning is zoning, a regulatory tool used for controlling the type of land use \npermitted  (e.g.,  residential  or  commercial).  Zoning  can  be  an  effective  tool  to  regulate  urban \ndevelopment in locations that are at risk from climate-related shocks and stresses. Zoning can restrict \ndevelopment in high-risk and environmentally sensitive areas, and can introduce measures to support \ndevelopment in a risk-sensitive manner. For example, large parts of Mildura, Australia, are at risk of \nflooding. An urban flood zone was created within the land use plan, which permitted development but \n \n ", "16  ADB Sustainable Development Working Paper Series No. 47 \nonly after compliance with certain safeguards to reduce flood risk, such as setback distances and \npermeability requirements on plots.23 \n \nHowever,  successful  implementation  of  zoning  as  a  tool  to  enhance  UCCR  will  depend  on  the \nflexibility in design and implementation (especially with the uncertainties associated with climate \nchange); synergy in enforcement with other development control tools used in surrounding areas, \nthereby promoting integrated approaches; and being reflective through regular updates of zoning \nregulations in order to capture changing nature of exposure and vulnerability.  \n \nReduce physical vulnerability through building controls. When it comes to design and building \ncontrols, regulations for the built environment can act as a way of driving UCCR through reduced \nexposure and vulnerability. This includes stipulating specifications for building sites and could involve \nmandated plinth heights as a way of reducing exposure to floods24 and the use of extra-strong \nfasteners to keep roofs securely fastened during high winds.25 Regulations on building enclosure are the \nthird pillar; these could include cool roofs (to reduce urban heat island effects), enhanced insulation \n(to reduce exposure to extreme temperatures), and installation of a range of devices to fend off shocks \nand stresses, such as power, climate control, veneers, cladding, overs, and braces (footnote 23). These \ndesign controls help ensure buildings can respond to changing conditions, thereby being flexible and \nfactoring redundancy. However, successful implementation of design and building controls requires \nadaptation of design codes to capture locally relevant risks, capacity to design and enforce, and \nincentives to encourage applications. It also requires establishing a culture of compliance.  \n \nAdopt principles of good urban planning: integrated, reflective, and inclusive. There is also a \ngrowing understanding that planning processes to enhance UCCR needs to be integrated, i.e., arrived \nat through collaboration and deliberation between a variety of different stakeholders (footnote 9). \nThis ensures that planners can spot interconnections, trade-offs, and other relationships between \nlevels of risk, functions and/or departments of the city, and priorities of different stakeholders. While \nmany existing urban planning regimes entail such processes of collaboration, these are typically open \nto a limited set of experts and the scope of discussion is narrow. This often leads to a model of \ntechnocratic consultation as opposed to genuine integration.  \n \nClosely linked to this is the importance of inclusion. There is a strong need to institute consultation \nwith different urban stakeholders\u2014elected and appointed officials, government staff, civil society \norganizations (CSOs), the business community, and the vulnerable population\u2014to develop consensus \non how current and future shocks and stresses will impact the city\u2019s vision and strategic development \npriorities, and what types of policies, investments, and practices are required to address the shocks and \nstresses (footnote 16). More specifically, poor and marginalized populations must participate in such \nconsultations as, more often than not, they are highly exposed (e.g., they reside in hazard-prone land in \npoor-quality shelters) and highly vulnerable (e.g., they have low levels of education, savings, and \nhealth) to the impacts of climate change.26  \n                                                                 \n23   ADB. 2015.

Finally, decision-\nmaking processes that inform planning for climate change resilience must be reflective, and decisions \nmade must be revisited at regular intervals, so the course of planning can be corrected if necessary \n(footnote 9). This is to be able to accommodate multiple, evolving risks and rising uncertainty owing to \nclimate change within planning regimes for enhanced UCCR. Reflection is also vital to breathe life into \nthe idea of flexibility enshrined within the concept of resilience, as it is key to cities developing the \nability to adopt alternative strategies in response to changing circumstances or sudden crises.  \n \nThese qualities (integrated, inclusive, and reflective), while not new to urban planning processes, are \nfurther gaining importance because of the benefits they bring to enhancing UCCR.  \n \n3.  Challenges \n \nPaucity of adequate data and information. First, there is a paucity of adequate information on \nexposure and vulnerability of people and assets to potential impact of climate change, and the lack of \ncapacity to use such information for decision-making purposes. Actions discussed in entry point 1 can \nhelp fill this gap. \n \nHigh degree of informality limits the potential of effectiveness of formal planning. Second, there \nis a high degree of urban informality in developing countries: 33% of all urban residents live in informal \nsettlements that do not fall squarely within the purview of planning systems.28 This means that the \nlevers of urbanization and development are usually not with those who are mandated to develop plans, \nsuch as city governments, but rather with private builders, businesses, slum-dweller federations, and \nresidents\u2019 welfare associations, for example. To overcome these challenges, urban planning processes \nshould reconcile the priorities of different groups and develop a shared vision for UCCR, include \nbottom-up approaches to community resilience planning (entry point 5), and engage with the private \nsector (entry point 6). \n \nGaining support of decision makers. Third, gaining the support of decision makers to adopt climate-\nresilient  land  use  policies  and  investments  may  prove  difficult,  because  the  policies  may  place \nadditional economic and regulatory requirements on interest groups such as land developers and \nproperty owners, and, in some instances, reduce the value of their land and assets. Thus, as a first step, \nit will be important to gain the consent of the city leader or other higher authorities in the government \nto factor climate change considerations in urban planning processes. The city leader needs to be \ninformed of all the relevant issues pertaining to factoring in climate change considerations, both for \nand against, so that informed decisions can be made regarding identification and prioritization of \ninvestments, allocation of financial and regulatory resources, and plan implementation. Needless to \nmention, the effectiveness of planning is limited if the plans are not operationalized. \n \n                                                                 \n27   S. O.

Entry Point 3: Development Processes Associated with Urban \nInfrastructure and Services  \n \n \nThis entry point looks at how urban infrastructure and services can strengthen climate change resilience. \nDiscussion here is based on six critical urban sectors identified by the Fifth Assessment Report of the \nIntergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change:  water  and  sanitation,  energy  supply,  transport  and \ntelecommunications, built environment, ecosystems, and health and social services.29 For each, the section \ndemonstrates how it can continue to provide undisrupted services through shocks and stresses, recover, and \ncontribute to the resilience of the city as a whole. \n \n \nKey Points\n \nOpportunities and Benefits \n \n\uf0b7  Good-quality urban infrastructure and services enhance the ability of urban areas to survive and thrive in the face \nof shocks and stresses related to climate change. \n\uf0b7  Utilizing existing processes associated with infrastructure sector development provides a sustainable route to \nurban climate change resilience (UCCR). \n \nActions and Modalities \n \n\uf0b7  Enhance  UCCR  across  vital  urban  sectors  and  services:  water  and  sanitation,  energy,  transport  and \ntelecommunications, ecosystems, built environment, and health and social services. \n\uf0b7  Adopt a systematic and systemic approach to enhance UCCR in urban sectors or systems as opposed to a \npiecemeal approach. \n \nChallenges \n \n\uf0b7  Limited political will to make infrastructure resilient \n\uf0b7  Lack of fiscal decentralization to make policy shifts and investments needed to mainstream resilience in \ndevelopment processes associated with urban infrastructure and services \n \n \n1.  Opportunities and Benefits \n \nInfrastructure, such as water supply and sanitation, transport, and energy, is critical for the social, \nenvironmental, and economic sustainability of urban areas. With the rapid growth of urban areas in \nAsia, large investments in infrastructure and services are expected over the next several decades. Such \ninfrastructure  has  a  long  design  life,  requires  a  long-term  planning  horizon  and  operation  and \nmaintenance commitments, and locks in investments for decades. Moreover, such infrastructure \ncomprises  large  and  diverse  networks  made  up  of  many  different  interdependent  components, \ncrossing diverse geologic conditions, and interruption caused in any part may result in interrupting the \n                                                                 \n29   A., Revi et al. 2014.

Thus, it is important to plan such infrastructure in a robust manner \nto ensure that climate-related shocks and stresses are factored in the planning, design, construction, \nand maintenance processes associated with the infrastructure. \n \nGood-quality and functioning infrastructure can reduce vulnerability. A growing body of evidence \ndemonstrates how regular provision of basic services can reduce socioeconomic vulnerability and thus \nenhance the ability of a system to function in times of shocks and deal with stresses. For example, \nmaking sure water and sanitation systems have redundant capacity\u2014i.e., the collapse of one section of \nthe system does not lead to complete breakdown\u2014or building energy systems using the principle of \nflexibility so neighborhoods have decentralized grids will help urban residents continue to receive life-\nsupporting services during times of upheaval.  \n \nExisting infrastructure sector development processes provide a sustainable route to enhance \nUCCR. Cities are expanding rapidly and face major resource (financial and capacity) constraints. \nThose responsible with managing these cities are overwhelmed when trying to meet the everyday \nneeds of urban residents. Thus, existing infrastructure sector development and urban service provision \nsystems should be leveraged to enhance UCCR as opposed to establishing parallel approaches. This \nwould then also help ensure local efforts to enhance UCCR endure, as these services are ultimately \noverseen and funded by city governments.  \n \n2.  Actions and Modalities \n \nActions can be undertaken across sectors to strengthen resilience to potential impacts of climate \nchange, which in turn will enhance the overall resilience of a city. \n \nWater  and  sanitation.  Climate  change  will  affect  water  supply  and  demand  in  cities.  Rising \ntemperatures  and  erratic  rainfall  will  exacerbate  the  depletion  of  groundwater  sources  through \nincreased use and the degradation of watersheds (32% of the population in Asia and the Pacific is \ngroundwater dependent).30 Rising sea levels and storm surges will potentially increase salt water \nintrusion. Urban heat island effects will contribute to greater evaporation from tanks and reservoirs. \nThe rising intensity of rainfall will overwhelm storm-water management systems and increase turbidity \nand sedimentation, leading to reduced availability of quality water31; and extreme events will damage \ninfrastructure.  \n \nSeveral  actions  can  make  urban  water  and  sanitation  services  more  resilient  to  climate  change. \nCurrently, most water supply systems assume a certain degree of fluctuation in supply, based on \nhistorical data and observed risks, but the high degree of uncertainty induced by climate change \nrenders these calculations less effective.32 To engage with high levels of fluctuation in water quantity \nand quality, water supply systems must have a greater degree of flexibility built in through both water \nmanagement  and  structural  measures  (footnote  29).  Flexible  water  management  will  entail \ndiversifying water sources, reducing demand, and working with water user groups (footnote 31). \nStructural flexibility can result from decentralizing distribution through some engineering techniques, \nincluding the strategic use of valves that can de-network one part of a system from another that may \nbe malfunctioning, and by laying pipes that can be moved and changed to accommodate various \n                                                                 \n30   Wellowner.org.

Climate change is set to affect energy supply and demand in cities. In terms of supply, \nhydroelectric power generation will be less because of the depleting volume of water in rivers, and \nthere will be more erratic supply from thermal power plants which are dependent on large volumes of \nwater for cooling.36 Gradual climatic changes such as sea level rise and extreme weather events could \ndestroy infrastructure\u2014e.g., oil refineries, as a large percentage of the world\u2019s oil refineries are located \nat sea. On the demand side, extreme temperatures will exacerbate urban heat island effects, leading to \nincreased demand for air-conditioning, and shortages in regular water supply will need to be met \nthrough the use of pump sets.  \n \nActions that can be undertaken to make energy systems more climate-resilient fall broadly into the \ncategories of management and technical solutions. Management solutions can help manage demand \nby, for instance, spreading awareness of low-technology solutions to deal with heat waves or through \npricing plans that make electricity use very expensive after certain thresholds are crossed. Technical \nsolutions that can improve supply are aimed mainly at enhancing \u201cintelligence\u201d (e.g., predictive tools to \ndetermine the location, nature, and extent of a potential fault so appropriate action can be taken);37 \nincreasing redundancy (e.g., having the option of drawing on multiple different sources of energy and \nswitching between these should either one fail); 38 or improving the ability of energy systems to couple \nand decouple from networks (central grids can expand access to different sources of energy, but \ndecoupling is important to avoid complete collapse should one part of the grid fail).39   \n \nTransport  and  telecommunications.  Potential  direct  impacts  here  could  include  damage  to \ninfrastructure  from  extreme  weather  events.  Across  the  world,  vital  transportation  systems  are \nconcentrated in cities, most of which are in highly exposed locations. Also, storms and high-speed \nwinds could damage above-ground transmission cables, soil erosion due to rising sea levels could \nexpose major telecommunication cables and trunk routes and telecommunication exchanges, and \nbase stations could overheat because of extreme temperatures, etc.40 Potential indirect effects are the \noverburdening of transport infrastructure owing to climate-induced migration, higher energy costs for \n                                                                 \n33   S.

For example, \nrailway lines could undergo stressing to permit them to function under higher temperatures; spare \nequipment (engines and carriages) could be distributed throughout a network; exposed or sensitive \npoints in the network could be identified; and alternative routes could be designated. At the same time, \na range of management processes could ensure the system can deal with climate impacts, including \nemergency planning and awareness raising on safety procedures and precautionary measures.42 These \nsystems  must  also  have  the  ability  to  recover  swiftly  should  they  fail.  Transport  and \ntelecommunications can enhance urban resilience by allowing urban populations to be evacuated and \nemergency services to operate during disasters. \n \nEcosystems. Changes in temperature and rainfall patterns, evaporation, humidity, soil moisture levels, \nvegetation  growth  rates,  water  tables  and  aquifer  levels,  and  air  quality  will  affect  ecosystems. \nUrbanization processes degrade ecosystems as urban expansion usually takes place in peri-urban \nareas  and  the  hinterlands,  which  play  critical  ecological  roles.  Furthermore,  areas  of  ecological \nimportance within cities are ignored or encroached on as the value of ecosystems and the role they \nplay is not adequately recognized or understood.43 At the same time, there is now enough evidence on \nthe vital provisioning (e.g., supply of fresh water) and regulating (e.g., reducing urban heat island \neffects, and flood control) roles ecosystems play for urban residents.44 \n \nThe resilience of ecosystems can be enhanced through conservation by means of development \ncontrols in areas of ecological importance (as discussed in entry point 2). Apart from locational \ncontrols  on  development,  structural  or  design  aspects  of  the  built  environment  could  enhance \nresilience through the promotion of \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d that is less disruptive to ecological cycles. \nThis type of infrastructure could include the use of a pervious surface to ensure watershed health;45 \ngreen roofs (that enable rainfall infiltration and evapotranspiration, and regulate temperature); green \ncorridors; and urban drainage systems that manage storm water sustainably.46  Strong and healthy \necosystems carry the capacity to reduce vulnerability (by providing quality water and food) and would \nalso help buffer the impact of climate extremes (by absorbing excess runoff, binding soils, and allowing \nrivers to flood safely).  \n \nBuilt environment. Buildings in all contexts will face degradation, but informal settlements that are \npoorly constructed on exposed land are even more susceptible to the impacts of a changing climate.47 \nExtreme climate events can destroy buildings, and the slower-onset impacts of climate change (e.g., \nincreasing salination) can weaken them over time.   \n \n                                                                 \n41   Volpe. 2014.

Most of these actions aim at enhancing robustness and redundancy. Use of \ninformation technology and sensors can enhance flexibility, through automated climate control that \ncan open and close vents and turn the air-conditioning up or down to adjust to temperatures or switch \npower sources based on disruptions.49 \n \nHealth and social services.

The city invested substantial \nfunds in equipping the system in a short span of time, setting up risk registers across the city, providing training to health-\ncare workers, upgrading hospital facilities, developing response plans and protocols, establishing better early warning \nsystems, and creating improved risk communication methods.  \n \n \nSource: T.

Effectively mainstreaming resilience qualities in \nurban infrastructure and services requires additional technical capacity and, often, financial resources \n(which may not produce revenue streams) as well as amendments to sector policies, regulations, cost \nnorms,  and  institutional  mandates.  Fractured  processes  of  decentralization  often  mean  city \ngovernments  are  not  empowered  to  make  changes  in  how  key  urban  sectors  and  services  are \nprioritized,  funded,  implemented,  and  operated,  as  the  provincial  and  national  levels  retain  this \nmandate. Clearly, those spearheading enterprises to enhance UCCR need to operate at multiple levels \nof governance.  \n \nLack of awareness on benefits of strengthening UCCR. The lack of awareness on climate-related \nshocks and stresses and the burden of day-to-day responsibilities deter the effective mainstreaming of \nresilience  within  urban  infrastructure  and  services.  This  shows  that  there  is  a  clear  need  to \ndemonstrate the co-benefits of enhancing UCCR.  \n \nWeak political support. In the case of climate shocks (such as extreme weather events), many city \nadministrations are concerned more with reacting to these shocks than with managing the  potential \nrisks.50 There are political  reasons for  this: city politicians are not motivated to invest time and \nresources in building resilience to avert losses that may occur only after the next election.51 There are \nalso administrative reasons: often, central and/or local governments are mandated to allocate reserves \nfor  responding  to  calamities  (including  climate-related  shocks),  but  preemptive  actions  for \nstrengthening resilience need to be financed from national or sector or city development budgets (with \ncompeting priorities and with limited positive revenue flows).  \n \nD.

Opportunities and Benefits \n \nAchieving and sustaining an agenda for UCCR requires champions to push the agenda, a heightened \nawareness and capacity among various stakeholders, and a commitment to translate awareness into \nindividual and collective actions. In many cases, urban local bodies have limited capacity, hence there \nis a strong need to work with city government officials to enhance knowledge, skills, and technical \nexpertise. Such increased local capacity can deliver a number of benefits in terms of enhancing UCCR. \n \nLocal experts have in-depth understanding of how cities function. The individuals involved in \ndifferent city departments have local knowledge and understand the complex ways in which cities \noperate. They often have a great deal of experience of how their departments and their services have \nhandled issues in the past. They are also likely to understand the changes required to enhance UCCR. \nTherefore,  putting  the  right  knowledge  in  their  hands  through  a  variety  of  capacity-building \ninterventions is likely to yield rich dividends.52  \n \nFocusing  capacity  building  initiatives  on  mid-  and  junior-level  professionals  ensures \nsustainability.  Senior civil servants are frequently transferred out of the city as and when changes in \npolitical leadership occur at the city, provincial, or national levels.53This means that vital institutional \nknowledge is not retained. In contrast, those in junior positions within urban departments tend to \nremain in their posts longer. Moreover, even if policies are formulated at higher levels of governance, it \nis  the  \u201cstreet-level  bureaucrats\u201d  or  middle  and  junior  actors  who  are  charged  with  their \nimplementation.54 Thus, the functionaries working within city departments are key in their day-to-day \n                                                                 \n52   D.

As  such, \nenhancing the knowledge and capacity of these functionaries could ensure a sustainable approach to \nenhancing UCCR. However, considering that application of urban resilience qualities may result in \nincrease in costs and regulatory changes, advocacy should be directed at senior functionaries to ensure \na mandate for UCCR, capacity building, and skills development for staff of municipal corporations.55 \n \n2.  Actions and Modalities  \n \nThe approaches for embedding UCCR principles and qualities in institutional capacities can be as \nfollows:  \n \nStrengthen capacity to understand risks and deploy actions to build resilience. Content should be \nfocused on understanding how the exposure and vulnerability of the city and its constituent systems to \nclimate change is affected by urban growth. Capacity building should also be focused on approaches \nfor designing and deploying inclusive policies with hard and soft actions that will result in enhanced \nUCCR. While it is not the task of city officials to downscale climate models and undertake CRVAs, they \nshould  be  working  in  close  partnership  with  climate  change  and  risk  assessment  specialists  to \nunderstand what the data climate models generate, the potential implications of climate risk, and how \nto use such information for urban development-related decision making. This would require having a \ngood understanding on the potential impacts of climate-related shocks and stresses; gauging the \nassets, skills, local knowledge, and social relations available to reduce their impact; and looking at the \nlevels of risk among different groups of people in order to prioritize action.56  \n \nCapacity building should focus on approaches for carrying out integrated and inclusive planning to \nenhance UCCR (as described in entry point 2). More specifically, it should involve the development of \na shared understanding of the nature and location of institutional responsibility\u2014which includes \ninstitutions at higher levels of administration, and may extend beyond administrative boundaries\u2014for \nenhancing climate change resilience; of how different city systems can contribute to UCCR (see entry \npoint 3); and of the types of financing mechanisms available to a city for implementing resilience-\nbuilding measures (see entry point 7).   \n  \nSelect  appropriate  methods  and  mechanisms  to  strengthen  capacity.  The  methods  and \nmechanisms  used  to  achieve  this  knowledge  transfer  are  equally  important  and  can  encourage \nreflective thinking and integrated approach toward decision making. For example, the shared learning \ndialogue  approach in the ACCCRN initiative entails iterative, structured, multistakeholder dialogues \nto understand how different components of a city (officials, academics, civil society, representatives of \nvulnerable communities, and the private sector) function, and to determine roles, responsibilities, and \nplans of action for enhancing resilience.57 Peer-to-peer learning is also crucial to enhance UCCR.58 This \nis because UCCR is a novel concept, and, while city government functionaries may sometimes struggle \nto see its value when approached by experts or academics, they are far more convinced when their \npeers in other cities explain its importance (footnote 55). Peer-to-peer learning between functionaries \nfrom cities with similar governance contexts, resources, and risk profiles permits a more effective \nexamination  of  common  challenges  and  methods  to  overcome  those  challenges  (footnote  55). \nAlternatively, learning between cities with major differences in terms of levels of resilience can help \n                                                                 \n55   Divya Sharma, interview, 25 August 2015. \n56   Asian Disaster Preparedness Center. 2010.

For \ninstance, under its Climate Change Resilient Development Project, the United States Agency for \nInternational  Development  (USAID)  facilitated  peer-to-peer  learning  between  eight  cities  facing \ncommon climatic and non-climatic stressors. The attending city teams were at different stages of \ndealing with these stressors and brought different approaches and solutions to the table.59 \n \nDifferent cities and even the departments within a city will have varying perspectives on climate change-\nrelated risks and will have different requirements in relation to capacity building. Thus, it is important to \nconduct a rapid needs assessment in advance of any interventions, for example through short semi-\nstructured interviews with a subset of the target cohort. Also, although it is impossible to prescribe a set \nformat for capacity building sessions, generally it is vital to first talk about climate impacts (past, present, \nand future) before going into institutional arrangements and resilience-building measures.  \n \n3.  Challenges  \n \nIncentivizing officials to participate in capacity building initiatives. This relates to incentivizing the \nparticipation of officials who are constantly dealing with pressing issues, which means pausing to learn, \nreflect, and imbibe new information is sometimes a luxury (footnote 49). Moreover, building resilience \ncurrently does not appear in their job descriptions and terms of references. The Energy and Resources \nInstitute and the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research target cities that have faced \ndisasters in the recent past and thus are more receptive to the idea of enhancing resilience, lobby \nsenior civil servants at provincial level to mandate participation, and project these sessions as valuable \nprofessional development opportunities (footnote 55).  \n \nUse of terminologies that are not common in the local language. Another important challenge \nentails the use of language. Terms such as \u201cresilience\u201d are notoriously difficult to translate into local \ndialects, which means grasping novel ideas associated with these becomes much more difficult. The \nInstitute for Social and Environmental Transition in India uses objects and activities to explain certain \npoints. For instance, a rubber band was used to explain the idea of building flexibility into city systems \nand a Swiss Army knife to explain redundancy (footnote 51). Other solutions include the formation of \nsmaller cohorts based on linguistic preferences and the preparation of bespoke training materials well \nin advance. More generally, protocols, mandates, rules, and legislation that provide an imperative for \nfunctionaries  to  participate  in  capacity-building  activities  are  scant,  thus  organizations  arranging \ntraining sessions will have to deploy creative approaches to incentivizing participation.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                 \n59   A.

Engaging and organizing communities from within can add to their capacity to improve \nbasic services that enhance resilience. Services such as water, transportation, education, and energy \nincrease communities\u2019 adaptive capacity to a range of risks, and not just risk from intensive shocks \n(footnote 29). The World Bank\u2019s World Development Report 2004: Making Services Work for Poor People \nalso emphasizes how community engagement can enhance the quality of service provision not only by \nincreasing the pressures of accountability on urban governments to provide services, but also by \npooling local resources to bridge deficits in service provision.62  \n \nCommunity engagement can capture different perceptions of risk and target inclusive measures \nto  strengthen  resilience.  The  community  engagement  process  can  help  local  governments \nunderstand how different populations within a community perceive risk differently and the varying \nroles in shaping risk. Such understanding can help in identifying investments targeting the most \nvulnerable, those that bring wider development gains in the immediate term, and those that at same \ntime are flexible enough to accommodate uncertainties arising from climate change.  \n \nInvolvement of communities is vital for managing residual risks. An added value to engaging with \ncommunities in the context of UCCR pertains to tackling residual risk.63 Residual risk is the risk that \nremains despite structural interventions to mitigate the adverse impact of shocks and stresses.64 The \nincreasing intensity and uncertainty of extreme weather events and their potential impacts in urban \nareas mean that appropriate measures must be put in place to ensure that the communities, especially \nthe most vulnerable, are prepared and can effectively respond when existing mechanisms for risk \nreduction are overwhelmed.65 Measures to manage the residual risk would include enhancing the \ninherent capacity within exposed and vulnerable communities to organize, mobilize, and coordinate in \norder to deal more effectively with exigent situations. This is crucial in resource-scarce governance \nsettings; more often than not, communities are the first responders when existing systems fail. \n \n2.  Actions and Modalities \n \nCommunities can undertake a wide range of actions to enhance UCCR, but all of these require two \nfundamental steps: (i) enhancing understanding of the drivers of climate-related shocks and stresses; \nand  (ii)  determining  and  prioritizing  pathways  of  resilience  through  community-level  planning, \nimplementation, and operations.   \n \nAdopt  participatory  methods to  assess  climate  risks. Typically, facilitation of community-level \naction to strengthen resilience is undertaken by CSOs and community-based organizations. It entails \nthe  use  of participatory  methods  whereby  different  members  of  the  community  are  collectively \nengaged  in  identifying  changing  patterns  of  climate  characteristics  and  factors  contributing  to \nexposure and vulnerability, and through dialogues coming to a conclusion about risk.

Results of such assessments should be communicated clearly to all stakeholders, allowing \nthem to make informed decisions regarding investments at the individual, household, and community \nlevel. Such participatory processes contribute to inclusiveness and are reflective in capturing the \nexperiences of the community.  \n \nUndertake community-based planning. Once shocks and stresses are mapped, communities are \nengaged in discussions to determine a set of local actions based on available opportunities and \nresources, thereby contributing to resourcefulness. These actions can range from hard solutions such \nas  building  protective  infrastructure  (to  reduce  exposure  to  extreme  weather  events)  to  softer \nmeasures such as awareness of the health impacts of particular weather extremes and measures to \ntackle these (to reduce vulnerability); and from strengthening early warning capacities to managing the \nresidual disaster risk. Box 7 details one well-recorded case that took place as part of the ACCCRN \ninitiative.66  \n \n \nBox 7: Microresilience Planning Initiative, Gorakhpur, India \n \nThe microresilience planning initiative in India was run by the Gorakhpur Environmental Action Group (a civil society \norganization) and entailed surveys and shared learning dialogues to determine risks using local knowledge and climate \nmodels. Shared learning dialogues centered on finding solutions to low-intensity, high-frequency flooding, also known as \nwaterlogging.a This was followed up by participatory exercises to determine actions to reduce risk and build resilience. \nThese included community organizations through the formation of residents\u2019 committees and appointing community \nresilience volunteers. These institutions were used to improve basic service provision both by demanding better services \nfrom the city government (e.g., more regular outreach clinics by government doctors to deal with waterborne diseases and \nactivation of a disused water tank in the neighborhood for better water supply) and by pooling community resources (e.g., \nupgrade and maintenance of an elevated communal toilet through local funds). Protective infrastructure was also \ndeveloped through the widening and reinforcement of drains, through the construction of a model elevated house and a \nflood-resilient  school.b  Residents\u2019  committees  were  then  charged  with  maintaining  this  infrastructure.  Finally,  to \nstrengthen sources of income, training was held on flood-resilient agriculture and diversification of income streams. These \nactivities at the local level were linked to city-level institutional structures through a \u201ccity advisory group\u201d composed of \nprominent citizens and experts that mediated communication between the community and the city government.  \n \nMeanwhile, a more subtle and somewhat serendipitous process enabled these communities to dismantle pernicious and \nrisk-inducing political structures. Building awareness, collectivism, and mobilization for the purposes of planning also \npermitted the community to challenge political interests that were undermining their resilience. For instance, residents\u2019 \ncommittees led by volunteers were now better able to demand improved services from the local municipal councilor, who \nwas forced to take action for fear of facing defeat in the upcoming election.c Similarly, improved community organization \nalso facilitated the institutionalization of a community-led solid waste management scheme that shed light on the \ninadequacy of existing arrangements put in place by the councilor, which were also allegedly a source of kickbacks. This \nunderlines how navigating complex governance challenges is key to enhancing urban climate change resilience. \n \nSources:  \na   S. O.

For instance, there is little point in \nwidening drainage networks to absorb excess runoff only for these to get clogged with solid waste that \nhas been disposed of improperly because of lack of awareness or ownership. As such, the participatory \noperation and maintenance of infrastructure can improve the quality of service delivery. This, in the \nlong term, increases adaptive capacity, which is a key component of resilience.67 Improvements in \nlevels of social and political capital are also key to enhancing adaptive capacity, and, as Box 7 shows, \ncommunity-level planning to enhance resilience carries the potential to support both.  \n \n3.  Challenges \n \nCommunity  engagement  is  complex  and  time-consuming.  First,  genuine  engagement  with \ncommunities on resilience is fraught with complexity. Far from being a cohesive entity, a community \ncontains social, political, and economic fault lines.68 Many perspectives need to be reconciled in any \ndecision-making process. This is partly to manage any trade-offs (see next paragraph) but also to \nensure that as wide a range of community members as possible take ownership. Participatory adaptive \nmanagement initiates regular dialogue between multiple groups within a particular geographic context \nprior  to  taking  action,  as  well  as  after  action  has  been  undertaken  to  review  impact  and  make \nchanges.69  \n \nBuilding community resilience entails trade-offs. Second, key to the discussion on complexity is the \ngrowing understanding that building resilience necessarily entails trade-offs: the reduction of risk and \nvulnerability for one group or individual can lead to an increase in the same for another.70 This was also \nseen when one group of vulnerable people in Gorakhpur, India decided that boundary walls around \ntheir houses were one way to reduce flooding risk. This ended in the increased inundation of another, \nless affluent group downstream that could not afford boundary walls.71 One clear strategy to overcome \nsuch a situation is to ensure that any climate-resilient community development program entails \ngenuine participatory spaces where traditionally marginalized groups are given an equal voice. This \npoint is highlighted very clearly in ADB\u2019s guidelines on participation: \u201cAll people are valued equally, \nopportunities for participation are adequately communicated and offered fairly, and barriers that stop \nparticular groups getting involved are challenged.\u201d72  \n \nSuccessful community engagement requires support from higher levels of government. Third, \nvulnerable communities in resource-scarce cities are, more often than not, economically and socially \nmarginalized. This means that mobilizing them is important but can never replace broader enterprises \nof resilience building at higher levels of governance. Thus, it is critical to ensure that any action at \ncommunity level is complemented by activity at the city, provincial, and, where needed, the national \nlevels.73  \n \n                                                                 \n67   A.

Entry Point 6: Tapping the Private Sector in Urban Areas \n \n \nThe private sector is one of the main engines of economic growth and a driver of wealth creation and \nphysical expansion in urban areas in recent decades. As such, there are huge potential gains from involving \nthe private sector in UCCR, both for the profitability of businesses themselves and for the wider resilience of \nthe urban area. Governments can influence investment-related decisions through planning, incentives, \nregulation, and knowledge sharing, but, given the significant resource and capacity constraints, the private \nsector plays a key entry point for enhancing UCCR, especially in terms of engaging the informal economy, \nwhere enforcement and compliance with formal planning and regulations is usually much weaker.  \n \n \nKey Points\n \nOpportunities and Benefits \n \n\uf0b7  Economic impacts of climate change are borne primarily by businesses, directly, indirectly, and via the wider \neconomy, and thus the private partnerships are likely to play a major role in securing finance to build resilience. \n\uf0b7  Incentives to invest in resilience building extend beyond economic benefits to include new market opportunities \nand other co-benefits.  \n \nActions and Modalities \n \n\uf0b7  Strengthen business continuity and protect supply chains. \n\uf0b7  Explore business opportunities by stabilizing existing markets and developing new markets. \n\uf0b7  Strengthen engagement of businesses with multistakeholder partnerships, including public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) \nor corporate social responsibility ventures. \n\uf0b7  Provide incentives to strengthen private sector engagement \n \nChallenges \n \n\uf0b7  Weak governance and poor fiscal decentralization, often resulting in poor regulatory environments for resilience, \nleading to poor private sector compliance with measures such as land use plans and building codes \n\uf0b7  Low knowledge and awareness of climate and disaster risks to businesses, lack of access to data, complicated \nregulatory frameworks, and lack of practical experience in building resilience into business practice \n \n \n                                                                 \n74   B.

Opportunities and Benefits \n \nThe private sector is expected to face a major brunt of the potential impacts of climate change, \nincluding destruction of property and equipment, damage to stocks, loss of revenue due to business \ninterruption, increases in operational cost, and other unexpected expenses due to climate-related \nshocks and stresses. Although the magnitude of these impacts will depend on a range of factors, \nincluding the location of the private sector operations and the nature, size, and ownership of the \nbusiness, typically there are opportunities to strengthen the private sector\u2019s climate change resilience.  \n \nPrivate sector absorbs a large share of climate-related impacts and will play an increasing role in \ninvesting in resilience. Climate-related shocks have a combination of direct, indirect, and wider \nmacroeconomic impacts on businesses. Direct impacts are centered on damage or destruction of \nassets such as physical infrastructure and human resources. While these impacts often receive the \ngreatest attention, economic losses are often exceeded by indirect impacts on flows of goods and \nservices.75 Flooding in Bangladesh\u2019s capital Dhaka, for example, cut production in the garment factories \nthat  underpin  the  country\u2019s  export-led  growth.  Floods  affected  the  factories  directly  but  also \nprevented staff, who often live in the city\u2019s inundated low-lying areas, from accessing their workplace, \ndriving production losses.76 Wider macroeconomic impacts on factors such as overall gross domestic \nproduct, employment, consumption, or inflation will also affect businesses through reduced sales and \nincreased production costs.77 Thus, the private sector needs to invest in resilience-building measures. \nMoreover,  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs)  can  help  bridge  the  gap  of  capacity  and  financial \nconstraints in the public sector, as well as link businesses with the policy support and incentives they \nneed for resilient investment. Such PPPs can also help businesses develop market niches and learn the \nvalue of building resilience into wider operations.  \n \nIncentives  for  the  private  sector  to  invest  in  resilience  extend  beyond  benefits  of  avoiding  \nlosses. Growing awareness of the impacts of climate change has already prompted some larger and \nmultinational corporations to pay increased attention to strengthening climate change resilience.78 \nIncentives for businesses to enhance UCCR extend beyond economic benefits to also encompass \nlegal  compliance  and  social  or  environment  responsibilities.79 Economic  incentives  include  those \nrelated to protecting business losses from potential impacts of climate change through climate-\ninformed  investment  decisions.  Another  set  of  incentives  stems  from  social  and  environmental \nresponsibility, including the duty of care to employees to prevent injury or loss of human life, as well as \nfrom a broader responsibility to mitigate the adverse impacts of extreme events on societal welfare.  \nThere is also a growing acknowledgement that investments in resilience building can yield co-benefits. \nThis \u201cresilience dividend\u201d can include benefits to the businesses undertaking the investments, such as \n                                                                 \n75   A.

Box 8 gives an \nexample of deriving a resilience dividend.  \n \n \nBox 8: Resilience Dividends of Flood Risk Management,Tabasco State, Mexico\n \nA study of flood defense investment in Tabasco found a benefit-cost ratio of 3:1, contributing to avoided damages and \nlosses when floods occurred in 2010 equivalent to $3 billion, or 7% of Tabasco\u2019s gross domestic product (or four times its \npublic works budget in 2014). This figure does not capture the full dividends of the investment at the state, city, and \nhousehold levels. Qualitative evidence suggests that, in reducing background risk in the area, these investments stimulated \ndevelopment dividends that included continued investment by oil companies in the region that were otherwise leaving, \nprivate investment in housing in previously flood-prone areas, and public investment in improved drainage and electricity \nnetworks in areas where floods had previously deterred. Investments also stimulated co-benefits for society and the \nenvironment. The local government has improved parks and street paving in areas once neglected because of regular \nflooding, and tree planting has begun on riverbanks to prevent landslides. \n \nSource:  T.

Actions and Modalities \n \nA wide range of potential actions can be identified for private sector engagement in enhancing UCCR. \nMany sectors can be pinpointed for engagement,80  with three modes distinguished. \n \nStrengthen business continuity. As companies become more engaged in global value chains, there \nare increasing needs to protect physical assets through robust structural measures, and to incorporate \nredundancy in supply chains, which would enable business continuity in the face of external shocks. \nWhile such actions are primarily to safeguard the company\u2019s own interests, it can also support other, \noften smaller, companies in the value chain. Small businesses, formal and informal, may also look to \nlocal chambers of commerce and/or business associations to educate them on climate change risks. \nThey can then jointly identify measures, including providing risk information, incentives, and capacity \nbuilding to better protect small businesses from these (footnote 80). \n \nExplore business opportunity. Provision of urban lifeline utilities such as communications, energy, \ntransport, water, and wastewater systems is often contracted out to private sector firms. Business \nengagement with resilience building may help stabilize existing markets or develop new opportunities, \nsuch as supplying robust urban infrastructure, providing risk information, or developing new hard and \nsoft technologies. Local governments in at-risk locations may enter into mutual aid agreements with \nsuch firms to formalize support that may be needed in the event of a disaster. Outreach to small-scale \nlocal construction-related service providers can be particularly important, as much of the building work \nin informal settlements and urban slums often takes place outside of formal regulatory systems.  \n \nConsider business as a stakeholder. PPPs are likely to become more common, given that many cities \nlack the financial resources to respond to the challenges of enhancing climate change resilience. These \ncould span activities such as delivering service contracts for public sector suppliers as well as full-scale \n                                                                 \n80   A.

International finance also plays a key catalytic role in developing \nUCCR programs and drawing in private sector actors. Local nongovernment organizations and CSOs \ncan support firms to attain some of their corporate social responsibility goals, including through \ncollaboration  with  finance  and  insurance  companies  on  risk  transfer  mechanisms  for  urban \ncommunities. Businesses themselves may also be central in developing collaborative initiatives, as the \nSouthern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce & Industry illustrated through the formation of the Surat \nClimate Change Trust in India, which draws in stakeholders to plan and tackle climate change to \nincrease the resilience of vulnerable sectors and communities to the adverse impacts of urbanization \nand climate change.81 \n \nProvide incentives for engaging the private sector. In addition, city authorities are increasingly \nexploring financial incentives for engaging the private sector in UCCR-related initiatives. These include \nsupportive changes to business, sales, and property taxes; rebates to promote installation of design \nfeatures that incorporate robustness, redundancy, and flexibility, such as flood-proofing or information \ntechnology backup systems; subsidies, grants, and soft loans; and financial aid following a disaster itself \n(footnote 80). There may also be incentives from fulfilling explicit contractual requirements with \npartners,  particularly  in  hazard-prone  locations  with  a  history  of  disaster-related  events.  These \npartners  include  government  bodies  as  part  of PPPs  as  well  as  other  businesses  or  clients,  and \nrequirements may relate to business continuity plans and insurance provisions.  \n \n3.  Challenges \n \nWeak  governance  resulting  in  poor  compliance  to  resilience-building  regulations.  The  key \nchallenges to effective engagement of the private sector in UCCR relate to governance, finance, \nknowledge, data, and business planning. Governance is a crucial determinant of effective resilience \nbuilding and remains a major challenge in many cities, with physical and population growth often \noutpacing government capacity.82 This leads to absence or weak enforcement of a suitable regulatory \nenvironment to incentivize resilience, for example through land use plan or building codes.  \n \nLack of awareness, especially among small and medium-sized businesses. Businesses may not be \nfully aware of the concept of UCCR, nor of how risks may change in a changing climate. This is likely to \nbe more pronounced for small and medium-sized and informal enterprises. Even where awareness \nexists, there may be challenges to investments in resilience, given the pressures for short-term returns, \nthe uncertainties and long return periods associated with climate change, and the need to weigh the \ncosts of building flexibility or redundancy into delivering value to shareholders. The growing emphasis \non resilience dividends is helping challenge this, but this evidence based practice is only just beginning \nto develop (footnotes 79). The inclusion of business stakeholders in enhancing UCCR, particularly \nthrough chambers of commerce or CSOs representing businesses, will be vital to raise awareness, build \nconsensus for action, and understand gaps in data and knowledge.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                 \n81   weADAPT.

Entry Point 7: Catalyzing Finances   \n \n \nOperationalizing the preceding six entry points will inevitably require financial resources. Enhancing the \nability of urban areas to access and absorb streams of funding to implement actions of enhancing resilience \nto climate change is the final entry point that requires close examination. \n \n \nKey Points\n \nOpportunities and Benefits \n \n\uf0b7  Basic financial management infrastructure exists in most cities, and existing funding streams should be taken \nadvantage of to support novel actions to enhance urban climate change resilience (UCCR). \n \nActions and Modalities \n \n\uf0b7  Catalyze action to ensure that finances available from various levels of governance are deployed to enhance \nUCCR. These include the following: \n\u2012  Local: microfinance and local development funds \n\u2012  City: private sector and city-level funds \n\u2012  Provincial and national: earmarked (e.g., funds for urban development) and non-earmarked (e.g., budget \nsupport for city governments) \n\u2012  International: multilateral, bilateral, and philanthropic funding \n \nChallenges \n \n\uf0b7  Poor understanding of costs and benefits of enhancing UCCR \n\uf0b7  Lack of financial absorptive capacity in cities  \n\uf0b7  Challenges with scaling up  \n\uf0b7  Lack of clarity on methodologies for outlining additionality of finance for UCCR \n \n \n1.  Opportunities and Benefits \n \nInfrastructure for financial management exists and can be creatively used to enhance UCCR. In \nmost cities, the basic structures for managing streams of funding for UCCR exist. Cities have the \nfiduciary  infrastructure  to  generate  local  funds,  receive  funds  from  provincial  and  national \ngovernments, program funds (e.g., by allocating them to different departments), and account for \nreceipts and expenditures. These systems may be weak and fractured, but financial management \ninfrastructure (protocols and personnel) to build on is usually present. It may be a case of taking \nadvantage of existing funding opportunities as opposed to the generation of fresh, exclusive streams of \nfunding. Many rapidly urbanizing countries have a large amount of funding (national or provincial) \nearmarked for urban development. For instance, two of India\u2019s nodal urban development programs \n \n ", "36  ADB Sustainable Development Working Paper Series No. 47 \nhave an outlay of $10 billion each. Creatively deploying even a small percentage of these funds could \nlead to substantial gains for UCCR.83 \n \n2.  Actions and Modalities \n \nThe options and instruments for generating finance for UCCR fall broadly into public and private \nsources at the local, city, national, and international scales.  \n \nTap localized sources of finance in support of UCCR. Highly localized sources of finance, including \nbottom-up  financing  mechanisms,  such  as  microcredit,  microinsurance,  and  microsavings,  can \nenhance resilience. Microcredit \u201ccan support entrepreneurial undertakings by those unable to get bank \nloans, help diversify local economies and empower women in particular, which can in turn contribute \nto adaptive capacity in a local context\u201d (footnote 29: 38). Informal or semiformal savings groups also \nplay an important role in reducing risk in urban areas, as they provide quick access to emergency loans, \nespecially  in  informal  settlements  with  transient  populations  whose  access  to  formal  banking \nmechanisms  is  limited.  Microinsurance  can  also  enhance  UCCR.  For  example,  hazard-indexed \nmicroinsurance for small urban businesses can enable local markets to recover faster from climate-\nrelated shocks. Early indications from one such initiative being piloted by CSOs with 5,000 small \nbusinesses in Guwahati, India are positive.84 Of course, challenges exist around regulating microfinance \ninstitutions to prevent exploitative lending, and there is a lack of clarity on how it can be deployed to \nmake collective investments (e.g., to improve drainage). Despite this, there is evidence that \u201clocally \ncontrolled funds managed directly by organizations of low-income urban residents have shown their \nability  to  reduce  risk  and  vulnerability\u201d  (footnote  74:  1),  and  they  contribute  significantly  to \ninclusiveness.   \n \nUtilize local development funds to support resilience-building measures. Countries with a degree \nof political devolution may provide public funding earmarked for local development. This includes \nfunds made available to locally elected political leaders to undertake development activity in their \nconstituencies. In Gorakhpur, India, community activism on urban resilience in one municipal ward has \nled to some of these funds being deployed to enhance resilience (improving drainage to deal with low-\nintensity, high-frequency flooding).85 Community mobilization of the type discussed in entry point 5 \ncan ensure more such funds go into building resilience and thereby contribute to resourcefulness.  \nSometimes these funds are based on performance criteria which could include direct or indirect \ncriteria, leading to enhancing UCCR. For example, in Nepal, local governments can access block grants \nunder the national Minimum Conditions Performance Criteria program. Some of these criteria, such as \n\u201cfollowing building regulations,\u201d can directly contribute to reducing risks from extreme climate events.  \n \nLeveraging city\u2019s own financial resources. Funds for resilience can also come from a city\u2019s own \nfinancial sources. The main sources of municipal revenue include some form of taxes on income, \ncorporate revenues, property, goods, and services; excise; intergovernmental resource transfers; and \ninstitutional grants.86 The revenue is then plowed into a range of expenditure streams, including the \n                                                                 \n83 Government of India, Prime Minister's Office.. 2015.

Therefore, ensuring \nthat resilience principles are effectively mainstreamed into sector plans increases the chance of some \nof these resources enhancing UCCR. City revenues may also be devoted to \u201cbespoke\u201d activities. These \ncould include a range of actions from building infrastructure to reduce exposure to hazards, to \ndeveloping institutional mechanisms to deal with climate change impacts and raising awareness on \ndrivers of risk and pathways of resilience. Cities are taking a growing number of actions to enhance \nUCCR  by  using  their  own  resources.  For  example,  the  Ahmedabad  Municipal  Corporation  has \ndeveloped a plan to enhance resilience against heat waves by investing in early warning infrastructure, \ndesignating  responsibility  for  taking  action  to  officials,  building  the  capacity  of  health  care \nprofessionals, and financing awareness-raising initiatives.87 \n \nTap finances available with the private sector. Finance from the private sector can also play a key \nrole, including through investments in the provision of risk transfer mechanisms or insurance, climate-\nproofing supply chains, and business continuity that ensures urban economies continue to flourish in \nthe face of disturbance. Deutsche Post DHL (the world\u2019s largest courier company) is investing human \nand financial resources in working with airports in cities across Bangladesh, El Salvador, Indonesia, \nLebanon, Nepal, and Turkey to ensure, through training and contingency planning, that they continue \nto function when disasters occur.88  \n \nExplore financing available from higher levels of government. More often than not, provincial and \nnational levels streams of funding are those that are vital for enhancing UCCR. Many countries suffer \nfrom  fractured  processes  of  decentralization,  whereby  political  and  administrative  functions  are \ndevolved but fiscal power is retained at higher levels of governance.89 Revenue transfers from federal \nand state governments to cities could be earmarked for specific development works or take the form of \nnon-earmarked budget support in line with the city\u2019s priorities. Both could be used to enhance UCCR. \nSome of the non-earmarked funds will go into sector plans (of the type discussed in entry point 3); \nmainstreaming resilience qualities into these will ensure that provincial or national streams of finance \nare deployed to enhance UCCR. These streams could also enhance resilience through the imposition \nof \u201cconditionalities\u201d in return for access. It is possible for legislation or protocols to stipulate the release \nof funds to cities only after they have met a set of conditions that enhance resilience. In Brazil, the \nstate of Paran\u00e1 deploys criteria such as improvements in physical and biological quality (fauna and \nflora), quality of water resources, and quality of planning to determine the share of resources certain \nmunicipalities get (footnote 29).  \n \nWhen it comes to earmarked funds of the type that come attached to urban development programs \nfor  enhancing  upgrade  in  information  technology  infrastructure,  transport  systems,  roads,  and \ndrainage, it is a matter of city-level officials using these creatively to also deliver a resilience benefit.  \nFor this, those charged with requesting and programming these funds must understand how resilience \ncan be beneficial (entry point 4). Alternatively, these funds could also be conditional (Box 9). A small \nnumber of developing countries are also starting to develop national funds to provide financing for risk \nreduction, adaptation, and resilience. The Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund ($100 million per \nyear) offers city governments access to finance for specific projects.   \n \n                                                                 \n87   A.

In international sources, multilateral and bilateral \nclimate finance mechanisms are proliferating, and some of these are focusing increasingly on urban \nareas, with some of their financing being employed to enhance resilience. A recent analysis reveals that \n$77 million was given to urban resilience projects from 2010 to 2012 in the form of multilateral \nfinding.90  These  projects  focused  on  resilient  infrastructure,  improving  institutional  capacity  and \nplanning, and ecosystem-based approaches to enhancing resilience. Of course, this is only a tiny \nfraction of the amount needed for UCCR, but it demonstrates that there is potential to expand the \namount  of  finance  flowing  from  these  funds  toward  resilience  projects.  Bilateral  aid  for  urban \nadaptation and resilience totaled $720 million per year during 2010\u20132012, mostly going to cities in \nAsia,91 although there are questions on the degree to which this is different from \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d \ndevelopment funding (footnote 90). Other international sources of climate finance include targeted \nflows from philanthropic ventures and charities such as the Rockefeller Foundation\u2019s ACCCRN and \nthe 100 Resilient Cities initiative.  \n \nFinally, it is only through catalytic action from a diverse array of agents that sources of finance can be \nused  to  enhance  UCCR.  A  pilot  CSO  project  in  Guwahati,  India  provided  hazard-indexed \nmicroinsurance and mobilized community members to demand the allocation of local funds for \nresilience. There is also a need for advocacy and capacity building to ensure public expenditure at the \ncity level supports UCCR. While the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation led the heat action planning \nprocess, it received technical support from a consortium of international and national nongovernment \norganizations. Even in the case of the Deutsche Post DHL initiative, the United Nations Development \nProgramme created an enabling environment. Similarly, there is a need to build adequate capacity at \nthe different levels of governance to ensure that international climate finance can be usefully deployed \nto enhance resilience.  \n \nWhile the exact nature of these catalytic activities will vary, they are all aimed at generating demand for \nthe supply of funds. International actors including multilateral banks can play this catalytic role in \ndeveloping  tools  and  methodologies  to  enhance  financial  absorptive  capacity  and  bringing  key \nstakeholders together to facilitate financial flows.92 \n                                                                 \n90   S.

Challenges  \n \nChallenges are ample and include the following:  \n \nInadequate understanding of financial benefits of investing in resilience. First, even though much \nprogress has been made in terms of understanding the financial benefits of investing in resilience, this \nremains an inexact science at best. Even where such analysis has been done, it has not always been \nsuccessful in mobilizing investment, as just avoiding loss is not seen as adequate motivation for \npoliticians to sanction resources for resilience.93 A growing interest in methodologies to calculate a \n\u201cresilience dividend,\u201d which would permit the analysis of additional benefits (such as cities with \nresilient infrastructure being perceived as attractive investment destinations), seems to offer a way \naround this.   \n \nLack of capacity to absorb and program funds for UCCR. Second, capacity to usefully absorb and \nprogram funds for urban resilience is deficient. This is why a recent review of multilateral urban climate \nfinance underlines an urgent need to build absorptive and technical capacities at the local level. \nStrengthening the capacity of cities to receive climate finance by, for instance, having plans for a \nfeasible set of resilience projects is an \u201carea of untapped potential\u201d for those looking to sustainably \nsupport  UCCR  (footnote  90).  Other  actions  would  include  improving  fiduciary  management \nprocesses in urban governments, so they comply with national and international standards expected of \nfund recipients (Box 10). \n \n \nBox 10: World Bank City Creditworthiness Initiative \n \nThe World Bank\u2019s City Creditworthiness Initiative helps cities improve their financial performance to increase their ability \nto secure and effectively program finances for delivering climate-smart infrastructure and services. Hands-on learning \nprograms teach city leaders the fundamentals of creditworthiness and municipal finance, including issues determined by \nthe enabling environment and options for financing, revenue management and enhancement, expenditure control and \nasset maintenance, capital investment planning, debt management, and scoping out options for financing. This is one \nexample of how the demand or any kind of development finance, including that for enhancing urban climate change \nresilience, can be strengthened.  \n \n \nSource: World Bank. 2015.

Third, while local or bottom-up financing for resilience has been quite \neffective in isolated pockets, there remain challenges around scaling this up for greater impact and \nsustainability. This is primarily because local contextual factors play a major role in defining the \ndynamics of these funds, and there is no homogenous formula that can be applied uniformly to unlock \nlocal sources of climate finance across a large number of cities. The fostering of \u201cfederations\u201d of local \nfinance mechanisms can help overcome this. Urban Poor Fund International capitalizes on local funds \nestablished by its 33 national federations across 464 cities to combine the collective savings of \nresidents with donor (and sometimes state) funds, and sends this money to local stakeholders via \nmember federations (footnote 74). Since its foundation, Urban Poor Fund International has channeled \n$20 million for a range of actions, including some aimed at UCCR. \n                                                                 \n93   Michael Rattinger, interview, 4 September 2015. \n \n ", "40  ADB Sustainable Development Working Paper Series No. 47 \n \nLack of methodological clarity in calculating additionality. Finally, greater scrutiny of financial \nstreams is needed to ensure that funds being made available or deployed for \u201cdevelopment as usual\u201d \nare not packaged as resilience. ADB highlights this issue by noting that, \u201cClearly, development and \naddressing climate change (mitigation and/or adaptation) are not the same. Development projects \nmay, or may not be modified so that they, contribute to mitigation and/or adaptation\u2026 Conceptually it \ncan  be  difficult  to  classify  a  project  as  being  development  or  as  combatting  climate  change.\u201d94 \nOutlining the \u201cadditionality\u201d climate finance brings is easier in the context of mitigation (as abated \nemissions can be measured); amendments or alterations made to projects to accommodate the risk of \nclimate  impacts  are  difficult  to  quantify.  This  is  because  the  changes  needed  for  resilience  are \nextremely context-specific, and because being \u201cadapted\u201d to risks is key anyway to the success of the \ninitiative rather than being an \u201caddition.\u201d  \n \n \nIV.  KNOWLEDGE GAPS \n \nA review of the opportunities, actions, and challenges in each of the seven entry points suggests that \nthey need to come together in contextually relevant combinations to deliver UCCR instead of being \ntreated as isolated sectors of activity. This relates back to the importance of understanding the city as a \ncomplex system (discussed in section II.B). For example, the right data need to be inserted (entry point \n1) into comprehensive urban resilience planning processes (entry point 2) to mainstream resilience \ninto key urban infrastructure systems (entry point 3) through inclusive processes that engage a variety \nof stakeholders (entry points 4, 5, and 6) using appropriate finance (entry point 7) to enhance UCCR. \nCertain cities may have made more progress on some entry points (e.g., they may have adequate data \nor information) more than on others (e.g., the private sector may not be aware of the need for UCCR), \nnecessitating a different emphasis on each of the entry points based on local contextual factors.   \n \nChallenges for each entry point are identified above, but some broader gaps in knowledge on UCCR \ncut across the entry points, including the following:  \n \n(i)  It is impossible to enhance UCCR without engaging with key governance challenges. \nFractured processes of decentralization across low- and middle-income countries in Asia \nand the Pacific mean that city governments usually cannot mandate the shifts in policy \nand planning required to build resilience. Those building UCCR need not only bring \ntechnical  expertise  but  also  act  as  savvy  policy  entrepreneurs  so  they  can  exploit \nwindows of opportunity in policy and planning processes that may accompany changes \nin political leadership at the right moment. Overall, good governance through rights, \nentitlements, and accountability is vital, because it results in improved delivery of basic \nservices, which can tangibly enhance people\u2019s resilience to a range of climate-related \nshocks and stresses.  \n(ii)  Enhancing UCCR also entails navigating tricky issues around politics and power. The \npreceding sections have discussed how the large amount of informality and lack of \nregulation in urban areas mean that extra-governmental actors such as private builders, \nfederations of slum residents, and community-based CSOs need to be part of any \nprocess to enhance UCCR.

Key  to  this  engagement  is  mapping  incentives  for  participation.  For \ninstance, explaining to builders that construction in low-lying areas is a risky investment \ncould be more effective than more altruistic appeals. Understanding the incentives of \nlegislators and city politicians is also crucial: arguments that demonstrate how enhancing \nUCCR can deliver benefits today while also helping the city prepare for an uncertain \nfuture are clearly needed. A techno-managerial approach that is not alive to political \nrealities and the functioning of power is unlikely to result in major gains for UCCR.95 \n(iii)  Finally, engaging with complexity is key to building UCCR. Indeed, the very structure of \nthis paper and the seven entry points further emphasize the need to engage with the city \nas a complex system. Understanding the spatial, temporal, and sector relationships that \nmake a city tick is vital. Those spearheading UCCR initiatives can positively engage with \nthis complexity by garnering the viewpoints of those with a keen understanding of \ndifferent parts of the city system. As such, the literature on UCCR repeatedly highlights \nthe need for platforms where diverse constituencies can jointly deliberate and determine \npathways of resilience. Inclusive and iterative processes of engagement can help make \nprogress on this count.96  \n \nLeveraging the potential of the entry points presented in this paper, while paying attention to the \nissues highlighted in this section, will help ensure that UCCR initiatives can support rapidly growing \nand densifying urban areas to not only function but also flourish in the face of dangers posed by a \nchanging climate.  \n \n \n                                                                 \n95   Saleem Ul Haq, interview, 9 September 2015. \n96   Astrid Wigstrom, interview, 22 September 2015. \n \n ", " \nGLOSSARY OF KEY TERMS \n \nClimate change   A change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g., by using statistical \ntests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties and that persists \nfor an extended period, typically decades or longer.
