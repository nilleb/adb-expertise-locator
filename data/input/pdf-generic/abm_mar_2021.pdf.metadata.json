Bucking the regional trend, the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Viet Nam posted \npositive growth in 2020. \n\nBuoyed by the better economic outlook, financial \nconditions improved. Most regional central banks \nmaintained their accommodative monetary stances to \nsupport the fragile recovery. Improved sentiment lifted \nmost equity markets and regional currencies between \n31\u00a0December and 15 February. Risk premiums were \nbroadly unchanged during the review period. Capital flows \ninto the region\u2019s equities and bond markets also recovered \nin Q4 2020. \n\nDownside risks in 2021 have receded compared to the \nprevious year on the back of the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) vaccine rollouts. However, the uncertain \ntrajectory of the pandemic remains the biggest risk to \nthe global economic recovery. This risk is exacerbated \nby uneven vaccine rollouts across economies. Another \nrisk is a rise in asset prices due to the increased liquidity \ngenerated by central banks in the region. A sudden \ndownturn in equity prices or a reversal in monetary \nstances by central banks in response to inflationary \npressures could destabilize financial markets. One factor \nin this is the passage of the USD1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus \nprogram in the United States, which has raised further \nconcerns of inflation and Federal Reserve tightening. This \ncould cause a pullback of capital from emerging markets.\n\nEmerging East Asia\u2019s local currency \nbond market rose to an aggregate size of \nUSD20.1\u00a0trillion at the end of December.\n\nLocal currency (LCY) bonds outstanding in emerging \nEast\u00a0Asia reached USD20.1 trillion at the end of \nDecember. Overall growth of the region\u2019s bond market \nslowed to 3.1% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) in Q4 2020 \nfrom 4.8%\u00a0q-o-q in the third quarter (Q3) of 2020. On a \nyear-on-year (y-o-y) basis, growth inched up to 18.1% in \nQ4\u00a02020 from 17.4% in Q3 2020. Emerging East Asia\u2019s \nLCY bond market size expanded to the equivalent of \n97.7% of the region\u2019s GDP at the end of Q4 2020 from \n95.9% in Q3 2020.\n\nGovernment bonds accounted for 61.8% of the regional \nLCY bond stock at the end of December. The region\u2019s \ngovernment bond stock reached USD12.4 trillion, \nposting growth of 3.6% q-o-q and 19.5% y-o-y. Corporate \nbonds accounted for the remaining 38.2%. The region\u2019s \ncorporate bond stock amounted to USD7.7 trillion at the \nend of December, growing by 2.2% q-o-q and 16.1% y-o-y.\n\nThe PRC remained the region\u2019s largest bond market, \naccounting for 77.4% of emerging East Asia\u2019s total bond \nstock at the end of December. This was followed by the \nRepublic of Korea (12.1%) and the aggregate among \nmembers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(9.0%).2\n\nLCY bond issuance in emerging East Asia totaled \nUSD2.0 trillion in Q4 2020. Government bond issuance \naccounted for 54.8% of the quarterly total and stood \nat USD1.1 trillion. Government bond issuance declined \n23.5% q-o-q but rose 47.3% y-o-y. Issuance of corporate \nbonds reached USD0.9 trillion, contracting 0.9% q-o-q \nbut expanding 17.3% y-o-y.\n\nThe March issue of the Asia Bond Monitor includes a \nbox discussing differences between the development of \ncorporate bond markets in East Asia and Latin America, \n\n \n1  Emerging East Asia comprises the People\u2019s Republic of China; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; the Philippines; Singapore; Thailand; and Viet Nam.\n2  LCY bond statistics for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations include the markets of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam.\n\n\fand the implications of such differences for financial \nresilience. This issue also contains three special sections: \n(i) environmental, social, and governance (ESG) bonds in \nASEAN+3; (ii) recent developments in social bonds; and \n(iii) key findings of AsianBondsOnline\u2019s 2020 bond market \nliquidity survey.3\n\nBox: A Comparison of the Expansion of \nCorporate Bond Markets in East Asia \nand Latin America\n\nCorporate bond issuance steadily increased in East\u00a0Asian \nand Latin American economies between 2010 and\u00a02019. \nThe ratio of corporate debt issuance to GDP rose from \n119% to 144% in East Asia and from 34% to 42% in \nLatin\u00a0America. In contrast with the common growth trend, \nbonds were issued largely through domestic markets \nand in domestic currency in East Asia, while bonds were \nlargely issued in international markets and in foreign \ncurrency in Latin America. As a result, Latin America is \nmore vulnerable to changes in global market conditions \nand currency fluctuations than East Asia.\n\nSpecial Section: Environmental,  \nSocial, and Governance Bonds  \nin ASEAN+3\n\nESG bonds outstanding in ASEAN+3 markets reached a \nsize of over USD265 billion at the end of December 2020. \nGreen bonds continued to dominate the ESG bond stock, \nhowever, their share of the total has declined due to an \nincrease in issuance of social bonds and sustainability \nbonds. At the end of December, the PRC accounted for \nthe largest share of ESG bonds outstanding in ASEAN+3 \nmarkets, followed by Japan and the Republic of Korea.\n\nSpecial Section: Social Bonds\u2014 \nRecent Developments and Trends\n\nA Primer and Recent Developments  \nin Asia\n\nThe ESG bond market has grown significantly over the \nlast few years in response to growing demand. The green \nbond segment dominates the ESG bond market, with \ngreen bond issuance growing to about USD240\u00a0billion \nand social bond issuance reaching around USD150\u00a0billion \n\nHighlights\u2003vii\n\nin 2020. Issuance in Asia has been dominated by \ngovernment-related agency issuers in high-income \neconomies such as Japan and the Republic of Korea. \nYet, developing Asia\u2019s urgent economic and social \ndevelopment funding needs strengthen the case for a \nrobust social bond market.4 This section also discusses \nthe impediments to market growth and the regulatory \nmeasures needed to further develop the social bond \nmarket in the region.\n\nA Nascent Opportunity for \nESG\u00a0Investing\n\nThe unprecedented growth of social bonds amid \nCOVID-19 points to the potential of social bonds in \nfinancing projects with positive social impacts while also \nproviding new opportunities for institutional investors. \nInvesting in social bonds is beneficial for institutional \ninvestors for several reasons. First, the risk\u2013return profile \nof a social bond is in line with that of a traditional bond \nfrom the same issuer. Second, social bonds provide a \nplatform for engagement with corporate issuers. Third, \nsocial bonds provide investors with a mechanism to signal \ntheir commitment to global social issues and measure \nthe social impact of their investments. Since the market \nshake-up caused by COVID-19 is expected to persist, \ninvesting in social bonds at an early stage will allow \ninstitutional investors to support the development of \nthis innovative instrument and reap the benefits of the \nexpected market expansion.\n\nPromoting Social Bonds for  \nImpact Investments in Asia\n\nThis section explores how the focus of social bonds has \nevolved amid the COVID-19 pandemic and contains \na detailed discussion on key social areas that could \nbe targeted. A two-pronged approach is proposed to \noptimize the use of social bonds in financing economic \nrecovery from COVID-19. The approach involves \n(i)\u00a0targeting urgent short-term needs such as employment \ngeneration, small business support, and healthcare \nprovision; and (ii) funding longer-term programs to \nreduce poverty and strengthen resilience against future \nshocks. Lastly, the section touches on the challenges and \nrecent developments in social impact assessment. \n\n3  ASEAN+3 comprises the 10 members of ASEAN plus the PRC, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.\n4  Developing Asia comprises the 46 developing member economies of the Asian Development Bank.\n\n\fviii\u2003Highlights\n\nSpecial Section: AsianBondsOnline 2020 \nBond Market Liquidity Survey \n\nAsianBondsOnline conducts an annual bond market \nliquidity survey to review the state of liquidity in the \nregion\u2019s LCY bond markets and identify areas of weakness \nfor further development. Overall, liquidity conditions \ndiverged across regional markets in 2020. While most \nsurvey participants from the PRC, Indonesia, Malaysia, \nand Viet Nam noted improved liquidity, those from \nthe Republic of Korea, the Philippines, Singapore, and \nThailand observed decreased liquidity. Respondents from \nHong Kong, China reported stable liquidity conditions. \nSurvey participants also noted that liquidity was greatly \nimpacted by market sentiment, the global COVID-19 \npandemic, and changes in domestic bond yields. \n\nIn nearly all markets, government bond turnover ratios \ndeclined the most during the second quarter of the year \nand steadily fell through Q4 2020. On the other hand, \nmovements in corporate bond turnover ratios were mixed \nin 2020. The survey, which was conducted in Q4 2020, \nfound that bid\u2013ask spreads for government bonds and \ncorporate bonds were largely unchanged from the 2019 \nsurvey results. \n\nSurvey participants ranked hedging mechanisms for \nboth government bonds and corporate bonds as the \nmost important market development priority, implying a \nneed to expand the availability of hedging instruments. \nIn contrast, settlement and custody scored the highest \nfor both bond segments, reflecting relatively efficient \nsettlement processes across the region\u2019s bond markets.\n\n\fGlobal and Regional  \nMarket Developments\n\nBond yields rose amid signs of economic \nrecovery and vaccination. \n\nLong-term government bond yields rose in major \nadvanced economies and most emerging East Asian \nmarkets from 31 December to 15 February on optimism \nover the global economic recovery and vaccine rollouts \nin 2021 (Table A).1 Positive economic sentiment was also \nreflected in the widening of the spread between 2-year \nand 10-year government bond yields.\n\nDuring the review period, 10-year government bond yields \namong major advanced economies rose, supported by \nimproved economic forecasts. In the United States (US), \nthe 10-year government bond yield gained a significant \n30\u00a0basis points (bps), while the 2-year yield marginally fell \nby 1 bp (Figure A). In addition to the positive economic \noutlook, rising yields were supported by expectations of \nadditional fiscal stimulus and ongoing vaccination efforts. \n \n\nTable A: Changes in Global Financial Conditions\n\nRecent economic data reflect the continued recovery of \nthe US economy. The Federal Reserve noted that gross \ndomestic product (GDP) in the US grew at an annualized \nrate of 4.1% in the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2020, following \na 33.4% gain in the previous quarter. Nonfarm payrolls \nrebounded in January, with an addition of 166,000 jobs \nversus a decline of 306,000 in December 2020. In \nFebruary, nonfarm payrolls further improved, with an \nadditional 379,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell \nto 6.2% in February from 6.3% and 6.7% in January and \nDecember, respectively. Retail sales also gained 7.6% \nmonth-on-month in January after declines of 1.0% and \n1.3% in December and November 2020, respectively. The \nFederal Reserve indicated that investor optimism was \nhigh, driven by vaccination efforts and expectations of \nstrong fiscal stimulus. \n\nThe Federal Reserve upgraded its GDP forecast in \nDecember, raising the forecasts for growth in 2021 and \n\n2-Year \nGovernment \nBond (bps)\n\n10-Year \nGovernment \nBond (bps)\n\n5-Year Credit \nDefault Swap \nSpread (bps)\n\nEquity Index \n(%)\n\nFX Rate  \n(%)\n\nMajor Advanced Economies\n\n\u2003United States\n\n\u2003United Kingdom\n\n\u2003Japan\n\n\u2003Germany\n\nEmerging East Asia\n\n\u2003China, People\u2019s Rep. of\n\n\u2003Hong Kong, China\n\n\u2003Indonesia\n\n\u2003Korea, Rep. of\n\n\u2003Malaysia\n\n\u2003Philippines\n\n\u2003Singapore\n\n\u2003Thailand\n\n\u2003Viet Nam\n\n(1)\n\n13 \n\n(0.3)\n\n0.5 \n\n10 \n\n2 \n\n70 \n\n(4)\n\n(0.1)\n\n4 \n\n4 \n\n12 \n\n14 \n\n30 \n\n37 \n\n6 \n\n19 \n\n10 \n\n26 \n\n36 \n\n14 \n\n20 \n\n13 \n\n24 \n\n11 \n\n(27)\n\n\u2013\n\n(2)\n\n(0.03)\n\n0.1 \n\n0.1 \n\n0.6 \n\n1 \n\n\u2013\n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n\u2013\n\n2 \n\n(1)\n\n4.8 \n\n4.6 \n\n8.3 \n\n2.8 \n\n5.2 \n\n10.8 \n\n4.9 \n\n9.5 \n\n(1.2)\n\n(2.5)\n\n3.1 \n\n5.1 \n\n1.0 \n\n\u2013\n\n1.7 \n\n(2.0)\n\n(0.7)\n\n1.1 \n\n0.01 \n\n1.0 \n\n(1.4)\n\n(0.3)\n\n0.2 \n\n(0.1)\n\n0.2 \n\n0.4 \n\n( ) = negative, \u2013 = not available, bps = basis points, FX = foreign exchange.\nNotes:\n1.

As widely expected, the Federal Reserve \nleft monetary policy unchanged during its 26\u201327 January \nmeeting, leaving the federal funds target rate range at \n0.0%\u20130.25%. \n\nThe euro area\u2019s economy continued to contract in \nQ4\u00a02020, as GDP declined 4.9% year-on-year (y-o-y) \nfollowing a decline of 4.2% in the third quarter. Industrial \nproduction also declined 0.1% month-on-month in \nDecember before rising 0.8% month-on-month in January. \nConcerns about rising cases of the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) and the emergence of new strains led the \nEuropean Central Bank (ECB), at its 10 December 2020 \nmeeting, to increase its pandemic emergency monthly \npurchase program by EUR500\u00a0billion to EUR1,850 billion, \nand to extend the program\u2019s end date to March 2022 from \nJune 2021. The ECB subsequently left monetary policy \nunchanged at its monetary policy meeting on 21\u00a0January.\n\nThe ECB noted that the pandemic caused a near-term \ndecline in output, while the central bank remained \ncautiously optimistic over the medium-term amid \nimproving signs for the global economy as well as \nexpanded vaccination programs around the world. In \nDecember, the ECB downgraded its 2021 and 2022 GDP \nforecasts to 3.9% and 4.2%, respectively, from 5.0% and \n3.2% in September. \n\nSimilar to the US, Japan also posted positive GDP growth \nin Q4 2020 at 11.7% y-o-y, albeit this was weaker than the \n\n22.8% y-o-y gain in the third quarter. At its 18 December \nmeeting, the Bank of Japan left the monetary policy \nrate unchanged and extended the duration of its asset \npurchase program (commercial paper and corporate \nbonds) by 6 months until the end of September 2021. \nThe\u00a0Bank of Japan also upgraded its GDP growth forecast \nfor 2021 and 2022 to 3.9% and 1.8%, respectively, from \n3.6% and 1.6% in September.\n\nSimilar to advanced economies, 2-year and 10-year \ngovernment bond yields rose in most emerging East\u00a0Asian \nmarkets during the review period. The largest rise in \nyields came from Indonesia, with its 2-year and 10-year \nyields rising 70 bps and 36 bps, respectively. Indonesia \nwas one of the earliest regional economies to start a \nvaccination program. In Q4 2020, Indonesia posted \na GDP contraction of 2.2% y-o-y, smaller than the \n3.5%\u00a0y-o-y contraction in the previous quarter. On \n18\u00a0February, Bank\u00a0Indonesia lowered its policy rate by \n25 bps to support economic growth and downgraded its \nforecast for 2021 GDP growth to a range of 4.3%\u20135.3% \nfrom 4.8%\u20135.8%. \n\nMalaysia\u2019s 10-year yield gained 20 bps during the review \nperiod. At its 20 January monetary policy meeting, \nBank\u00a0Negara Malaysia said that it expected economic \ngrowth to recover in the second half of 2021 despite \nnear-term weaknesses. Malaysia\u2019s yields were also \naffected by a ratings downgrade by Fitch to BBB+ from \nA\u2013 on 4 December 2020. Hong Kong, China; Singapore; \nthe Republic of Korea; the Philippines; Thailand; and the \nPeople\u2019s\u00a0Republic of China (PRC) all witnessed an increase \nin their respective 10-year government bond yield. The \nonly exception to the regional trend was Viet\u00a0Nam, \nwhich experienced a 27-bps decline in the 10-year \ngovernment bond yield that was driven by strong investor \ndemand. However, inflationary concerns are rising due \nto the unprecedented fiscal stimulus in response to the \npandemic, potentially placing further upward pressure on \nyields. The recent passage of the USD1.9 trillion (8.8% of \nGDP) fiscal stimulus plan in the US has raised concerns \nabout inflation in the US. Those concerns are evident in \nrising US bond yields and may prompt the Federal Reserve \nto tighten policy. Such tightening can potentially trigger \ncapital outflows and financial instability in the region.\n\nIn terms of economic performance, all emerging \nEast\u00a0Asian markets posted contractions in Q4 2020 \nexcept the PRC and Viet Nam.

To further support economic recovery in 2021, \nmost central banks in the region maintained their \naccommodative monetary stances, leaving policy rates \nunchanged during the review period (Table B).\n\nHowever, central banks may begin to tighten monetary \npolicy in response to inflationary pressures. More \nrecently, there are growing concerns about a possible \nspike in inflation fueled by the massive fiscal stimulus and \nmonetary easing seen in 2020.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nOne big positive shock to the global economy was the \nadvent of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines in \nNovember. The pandemic is far from over, but the good \nnews on vaccine developments and rollouts has lifted \nbusiness and consumer confidence. Reflecting the positive \nvaccine developments, the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF), in its latest World\u00a0Economic Outlook Update released \nin January 2021, upgraded its global growth forecast for \n2021 to 5.5% from an October 2020 forecast of 5.2%. The \nIMF also estimated that the world economy contracted \nby 3.5% in 2020. For 2022, the IMF kept its global growth \nforecast at 4.2%. For advanced economies, the IMF is \nprojecting growth of 4.3% in 2021 and 3.1% in 2022, \nfollowing an estimated contraction of 4.9% in 2020. The \n2021 growth forecast for the US was upgraded sharply \n\nin January to 5.1% from 3.1% in October. For emerging \nmarkets and developing economies, growth is projected to \nbe 6.3% in 2021 and 5.0% in 2022, following an estimated \ncontraction of 2.4% in 2020.\n\nAccording to the Asian Development Outlook Supplement \nreleased in December 2020, developing Asia is projected \nto grow 6.8% in 2021 after contracting an estimated \n0.4% in 2020.2 The Asian Development Bank\u2019s projected \n2021 growth figures for the PRC; the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN); the Republic of \nKorea; and Hong\u00a0Kong, China are 7.7%, 5.2%, 3.3%, and \n5.1%, respectively. Relative to the Asian Development \nOutlook released in September 2020, ASEAN\u2019s growth \nforecast was downgraded by 0.3 percentage points from \n5.5%, while the other three forecasts remained the same. \nIn 2020, the PRC grew by an estimated 2.1%; ASEAN; the \nRepublic of Korea; and Hong Kong, China contracted by \n4.4%, 0.9%, and 5.5%, respectively. \n\nTo sum up, both regional and global economic growth \nis expected to rebound strongly in 2021 after the severe \npandemic-induced downturn in 2020. The development \nof safe and effective vaccines was a positive shock to the \nregional and global economies. Despite the advent of \nvaccines, however, the economic outlook for developing \nAsia and the world remains subject to a great deal \nof uncertainty since COVID-19 is likely to persist for \nsome\u00a0time.\n\n2\u2002Developing Asia comprises the 46 developing member economies of the Asian Development Bank.\n\n\fFigure B.1: Equity Indexes in Emerging East Asia\n\nFigure B.2: Changes in Equity Indexes in Emerging East Asia\n\n4\u2003Asia Bond Monitor March 2021\n\n1 Jan-20 = 100\n\n170\n\n150\n\n130\n\n110\n\n90\n\n70\n\n50\nFeb-20\n\nApr-20\n\nJun-20\n\nSep-20\n\nNov-20\n\nFeb-21\n\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of\nHong Kong, China\nIndonesia\n\nKorea, Rep. of.\nMalaysia\nPhilippines\n\nSingapore\nThailand\nViet Nam\n\nNote: Data as of 15 February 2021.\nSource: AsianBondsOnline computations based on Bloomberg LP data.\n\nImprovement in investment sentiment supported regional \nequity markets.

The development of multiple safe and effective \nvaccines is a massive game-changer that can show a \nclear path toward the normalization of the economy \nand society. The unexpectedly rapid development of \nvaccines is nothing short of a miracle and a testament to \nthe ingenuity and hard work of the medical and scientific \ncommunities. The experience of Israel, which leads \nthe world in terms of vaccination rate, gives plenty of \ncause for optimism that vaccines will restore the world \nto pre-COVID-19 normalcy or something close to that. \nInfection rates are coming down sharply, social distancing \nrestrictions are being relaxed, and the economy is \nbeing\u00a0reopened.\n\nNotwithstanding the arrival of safe and effective vaccines, \nthe overarching risk to the global economic outlook and \nfinancial stability remains the trajectory of the COVID-19 \npandemic. There are a number of reasons why vaccine \ndevelopment mitigates the risk from the pandemic but \ndoes not eliminate it altogether. In fact, while this risk \nhas receded, it remains substantial for both emerging \nEast\u00a0Asia and the world.\n\nAbove all, vaccine rollouts have been uneven across \ncountries. Specifically, most of the global supply of safe \nand effective vaccines has been secured by advanced \neconomies. Some advanced economies such as Canada \nhave secured quantities that are several times larger \nthan their respective population. In stark contrast, many \ndeveloping countries face a severe shortage of vaccines. \nSince COVID-19 is an infectious global disease that can \neasily cross borders, it will not be brought fully under \ncontrol until much of the world, including developing \ncountries, has been vaccinated. And as long as the virus \nis not contained across the world, there is a nonnegligible \nrisk of a virulent resurgence like the one that ravaged \nEurope last fall. The slow progress of vaccine rollouts in \ndeveloping countries thus harms the entire world.\n\nThere are negative factors that amplify the risk from \nthe uneven vaccine rollouts and positive factors that \nmitigate the risk. On the negative side, the last few \n\nmonths have seen the emergence of new strains of \nCOVID-19 in Brazil, South Africa, the United Kingdom, \nand elsewhere. There is some evidence indicating \nthat particular variants may be more infectious \nand even more deadly. More importantly, there are \nconcerns that existing vaccines may be less effective \nagainst some variants. These considerations make it \nall the more imperative for vaccines to be distributed \nand administered across the world before we see a \nproliferation of intractable variants.\n\nOn the positive side, the rapid rollout in advanced \neconomies implies there will be more vaccines available \nfor developing countries in the coming months. The \nCOVID-19 Vaccines Global Access facility, which is \ncommonly known as COVAX, has been set up by the \nWorld Health Organization and other bodies to promote \nequitable access to vaccines. The facility has already \nsecured sizable supplies of vaccines for distribution to \ndeveloping countries. Furthermore, some of the vaccines \ndo not have to be stored at extremely cold temperatures, \nwhich reduces the storage and distribution logistics \nchallenges for developing countries.\n\nTo sum up, the advent of safe and effective vaccines \nis a massive positive shock for the global economy \nand financial markets, but the world is not out of the \nCOVID-19 woods yet. Far from it. The Israeli experience \nsuggests that extensive vaccination can normalize the \neconomy and society fairly quickly, even though the \npost-COVID-19 normal will differ in some ways from the \npre-COVID-19 normal\u2014e.g., voluntary social distancing \nand more work-from-home opportunities. Nevertheless, \nthe slow progress of vaccine rollouts in many countries, \nespecially developing countries, means that the threat of a \nvirulent resurgence remains. \n\nBeside risks that are directly related to COVID-19 and \nuneven vaccine rollouts, financial supervisory authorities \nwould do well to monitor asset prices. Some of the \nabundant liquidity unleashed by global and regional \ncentral banks is finding its way into asset markets. In \nthis connection, many stock markets around the world \nhave risen sharply since the market volatility of early \nMarch\u00a02020 (Figure G). While there are definitely major \npositive factors at play\u2014such as vaccine development and \nthe reopening of economies\u2014it is not clear whether the \nmagnitude of the escalation can be mostly, or even largely, \nexplained by those factors. Potentially unsustainable \nasset price inflation fueled by monetary expansion entails \n\n\fthe risk of a subsequent sharp and abrupt correction \nthat could destabilize the financial system. Furthermore, \nthe mix of monetary and fiscal stimulus may generate \ninflationary pressures for goods and services, not just \nassets. Central banks may respond by tightening monetary \npolicy, which could destabilize financial markets. An \nadditional source of potential risk is the passage of the \nUSD1.9 trillion US fiscal stimulus program, which has \ntriggered concerns about inflation, as evidenced by rising \nUS\u00a0bond yields. If the Federal Reserve responds by raising \ninterest rates, the consequent tightening of global liquidity \nmay cause a pullback of capital, which can potentially \ndestabilize the region\u2019s financial markets.\n\n1 Feb  2020 = 100\n160\n\n150\n\n140\n\n130\n\n120\n\n110\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\nGlobal and Regional Market Developments  \u20037\n\nFigure G: Stock Market Indices in Japan, the Republic \nof\u00a0Korea, and the United States\n\nMar\n-20\n\nApr\n-20\n\nMay\n-20\n\nJun\n-20\n\nJul\n-20\n\nAug\n-20\n\nSep\n-20\n\nOct\n-20\n\nNov\n-20\n\nDec\n-20\n\nJan\n-21\n\nFeb\n-21\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average Index\nKorea Composite Stock Price Index\n\nNikkei 300 Index\n\nNote: Data as of 24 February 2021.\nSource: Bloomberg LP.\n\n\fBond Market Developments\nin the Fourth Quarter of 2020\n\nSize and Composition\n\nThe size of emerging East Asia\u2019s local currency \nbond market reached USD20.1 trillion at the \nend of December.\n\nThe outstanding amount of local currency (LCY) bonds \nin emerging East Asia reached USD20.1 trillion at the \nend of December.3 Overall growth eased to 3.1%\u00a0quarter-\non-quarter (q-o-q) in the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2020 \nfrom 4.8% q-o-q in the third (Q3) quarter (Figure 1a). \nThe slowdown in growth stemmed primarily from a \ncontraction in issuance of government bonds in Q4\u00a02020, \nas most governments had already met their financing \nneeds to combat the impacts of the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) with large debt issuances in the previous \nquarters.

Meanwhile, growth in the corporate \nbond segment eased from 3.2% q-o-q in Q3\u00a02020 to \n2.4% q-o-q in Q4 2020, driven largely by a drop in \nissuance amid several high-profile bond defaults during \nthe review period. On an annual basis, growth in the PRC\u2019s \nLCY bond market rose to 20.5% y-o-y in Q4 2020 from \n19.9%\u00a0y-o-y in Q3 2020. \n\nThe Republic of Korea is home to the second-largest \nLCY bond market in emerging East Asia, with an \noutstanding bond stock of USD2.4 trillion at the end of \nDecember. Its share of the region\u2019s aggregate bond stock \nstood at 12.1% at the end of December. Growth in the \nRepublic\u00a0of\u00a0Korea\u2019s total bond stock slipped to 1.2% q-o-q \nin Q4\u00a02020 from 1.9% q-o-q in Q3 2020. The expansion \nin the aggregate LCY bond market was capped by weaker \ngrowth in the government segment, which outpaced the \nstronger growth in the corporate segment. Growth in \noutstanding government bonds dropped to 0.9% q-o-q \nin Q4 2020 from 3.0% q-o-q in Q3 2020, due mainly to a \ncontraction in issuance. Meanwhile, growth in corporate \nbonds outstanding picked up, rising to 1.4% q-o-q in \nQ4\u00a02020 from 1.1% q-o-q in the previous quarter. On a \n\nHong Kong, China\u2019s LCY bond market reached a size of \nUSD308.8 billion at the end of December, with growth \njumping to 4.7% q-o-q in Q4 2020 from 0.9% q-o-q \nin Q3 2020. Hong Kong, China\u2019s bond market was one \nof the three bond markets in the region that posted \nfaster q-o-q growth in Q4 2020 than in the preceding \nquarter. The faster growth stemmed from an accelerated \nexpansion in both the government and corporate bond \nsegments. Growth in the government bond segment \nsoared to 2.3%\u00a0q-o-q in Q4 2020 from 0.1% q-o-q in \nQ3 2020, driven primarily by a 30.1% q-o-q jump in the \noutstanding stock of Hong Kong Special Administrative \nRegion (HKSAR) bonds. The expansion in HKSAR \nbonds was due to an unprecedented rise in issuance of \nHKSAR retail bonds, including HKD15.0 billion worth \nof 3-year inflation-linked bonds and HKD15.0 billion \nworth of 3-year Silver Bonds\u2014a bond targeted at senior \nresidents aged 65 and older. On the other hand, the \nstock of Exchange Fund Bills barely grew, while the stock \nof Exchange Fund Notes continued to contract due to \nlimited issuance. Growth in corporate bonds accelerated \nto 7.1% q-o-q in Q4 2020 from 1.6%\u00a0q-o-q in Q3 2020. \nOn an annual basis, growth in Hong Kong, China\u2019s LCY \nbond market also quickened to 5.7% y-o-y in Q4 2020 \nfrom 1.0% y-o-y in the previous\u00a0quarter. \n\nAt the end of December, the total amount of LCY \nbonds outstanding among member economies of the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \nreached USD1,815.2 billion, up from USD1,755.5\u00a0billion \n(based on current exchange rates) at the end of \nSeptember.4 Overall growth moderated to 3.4% q-o-q \nin Q4 2020 from 4.7%\u00a0q-o-q in Q3 2020. On a y-o-y \nbasis, growth of aggregate ASEAN bonds outstanding \naccelerated to 13.9% in Q4 2020 from 11.4% in Q3 2020. \nThe ASEAN member economies\u2019 share of the region\u2019s \ntotal bond stock was broadly steady at 9.0% between \nQ3 2020 and Q4 2020. The stock of government bonds \namounted to USD1,297.7 billion at the end of December, \naccounting for a 71.5% share of the ASEAN total. \nCorporate bonds outstanding totaled USD517.5 billion \nand accounted for 28.5% of the aggregate ASEAN bond \nmarket. The LCY bond markets of Thailand, Malaysia, and \nSingapore remained the three largest in ASEAN at the \nend of December. \n\n4\u2002LCY bond statistics for ASEAN include the markets of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam.\n\n\f10\u2003Asia Bond Monitor March 2021\n\nThe outstanding amount of LCY bonds in Thailand \namounted to USD464.8 billion at the end of December. \nThailand was the only bond market in the region that \nposted negative q-o-q growth in Q4 2020, due to \ncontractions in both the government and corporate \nbond segments. The 0.3% q-o-q decline in government \nbonds outstanding in Q4 2020 was in contrast to \nthe 5.4% expansion posted in Q3 2020. Similarly, the \n1.8%\u00a0q-o-q drop in corporate bonds in Q4 2020 reversed \nthe 1.1%\u00a0q-o-q growth recorded in the previous quarter. \nA\u00a0high volume of maturities during the quarter brought \nabout much of the decline in the outstanding stock \nof both government and corporate bonds. On a y-o-y \nbasis, Thai\u00a0LCY bond market growth slipped to 5.2% in \nQ4\u00a02020 from 8.3% in Q3 2020. \n\nIn Malaysia, total LCY bonds outstanding reached \nUSD399.1 billion at the end of December. Growth \nmoderated to 1.3% q-o-q in Q4 2020 from 1.9% q-o-q \nin Q3 2020. The slowdown in growth stemmed largely \nfrom weaker growth in the government bond segment, \nwhere expansion eased to 0.5% q-o-q in Q4 2020 \nfrom 2.3%\u00a0q-o-q in the previous quarter. Contractions \nin issuance of treasury and other government bonds, \ncombined with a lack of new issuance and a relatively \nhigher volume of maturities in central bank bills, brought \nabout the slowdown in growth of government bonds \noutstanding. On the other hand, growth in corporate \nbonds rose to 2.2% q-o-q in Q4 2020 from 1.3% q-o-q in \nQ3 2020, buoyed by strong issuance. On an annual basis, \ngrowth in Malaysia\u2019s LCY bond market accelerated to \n8.0% y-o-y in Q4 2020 from 6.1% y-o-y in Q3 2020. \n\nMalaysia remained home to the largest sukuk (Islamic \nbond) market in emerging East Asia, with a total of \nUSD252.8 billion in sukuk outstanding at the end \nof December. Sukuk accounted for 63.3% of the \nMalaysian LCY bond market. At the end of December, \nthe outstanding stock of government sukuk totaled \nUSD101.4\u00a0billion, or 47.8% of Malaysia\u2019s government \nbonds, while outstanding corporate sukuk reached \nUSD151.4 billion, or 80.9% of the Malaysian corporate \nbond market. \n\nSingapore\u2019s LCY bonds outstanding totaled \nUSD380.4\u00a0billion at the end of December. Growth in total \noutstanding bonds rose to 3.9% q-o-q in Q4 2020 from \n2.1% q-o-q in Q3 2020. Singapore was one of the three \nmarkets that recorded faster LCY bond market growth in \nQ4 2020 than in Q3 2020. The faster growth was driven \n\nprimarily by the accelerated expansion of government \nbonds, with growth more than doubling to 5.3% q-o-q \nin Q4\u00a02020 from 2.4% q-o-q in the previous quarter. \nBoth Singapore Government Securities (SGS) bills and \nbonds and Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) bills \ncontributed to the growth. On the other hand, growth \nin corporate bonds outstanding slowed to 1.3% q-o-q in \nQ4 2020 from 1.6% q-o-q in Q3 2020. On a y-o-y basis, \nSingapore\u2019s LCY bond market growth inched up to 11.6% \nin Q4 2020 from 10.2% in Q3 2020. \n\nIn Indonesia, the LCY bond market reached a size of \nUSD321.5 billion at the end of December. Growth of total \nbonds outstanding quickened to 10.0% q-o-q in Q4\u00a02020 \nfrom 9.3% q-o-q in Q3 2020. Indonesia posted the fastest \nq-o-q bond market growth in emerging East\u00a0Asia in Q4 \n2020. The government bond segment drove the faster \ngrowth, as expansion of government bonds outstanding \nquickened to 11.6% q-o-q in Q4 2020 from 10.1% q-o-q \nin the previous quarter. The corporate bond segment \nrecorded a 3.4% q-o-q decline in Q4 2020, reversing the \n2.6% q-o-q rise in Q4 2020. A decline in issuance coupled \nwith increased maturities resulted in a smaller outstanding \nstock of corporate bonds at the end of December. On a \ny-o-y basis, growth in Indonesia\u2019s LCY bond market soared \nto 28.7% in Q4 2020 from 19.8% in Q3 2020. \n\nThe Philippines\u2019 LCY bond market amounted to \nUSD178.4 billion at the end of December. Overall growth \nslowed to 5.3% q-o-q in Q4 2020 from 8.8%\u00a0q-o-q in \nQ3 2020. The slower growth was driven by a slowdown \nin the government bond segment combined with a \ncontraction in the corporate bond segment. Growth in \nthe outstanding stock of government bonds dropped to \n7.0% q-o-q in Q4 2020 from 10.1% q-o-q in Q3\u00a02020, \nprimarily due to a contraction in issuance of treasury \nand government bonds; the government issued a fairly \nlarge amount of Retail Treasury Bonds in Q3\u00a02020, \nwhich met most of its financing requirements to \nsustain the economy amid the pandemic. Due mainly \nto a high volume of maturities and lower issuances, \nthe outstanding stock of corporate bonds contracted \n1.3%\u00a0q-o-q in Q4\u00a02020. On a y-o-y basis, the Philippines\u2019 \nLCY bond market expanded 28.9% in Q4 2020, up from \n21.5% in Q3\u00a02020. \n\nViet Nam\u2019s LCY bond market remained the smallest in \nemerging East Asia with an outstanding bond stock of \nUSD71.0 billion at the end of December. Overall bond \nmarket growth slowed to 8.1% q-o-q in Q4 2020 from \n\n\f11.8% q-o-q in Q3 2020. Growth of government bonds \noutstanding eased to 7.1% q-o-q in Q4 2020 from \n9.1%\u00a0q-o-q in Q3 2020 due to weaker growth in the \nissuance of treasury and other government bonds. The \nexpansion of the corporate bond market also slowed to \n13.6% q-o-q in Q4 2020 from 28.0% q-o-q in Q3\u00a02020 \ndue to a deeper contraction in debt sales following \na government decree that restricted corporate bond \nissuance. On a y-o-y basis, Viet Nam\u2019s bond market \nexpanded 31.7% in Q4 2020, up from 17.2% in the \nprevious quarter. \n\nGovernment bonds continued to dominate emerging \nEast Asia\u2019s LCY bond market in Q4 2020. The region\u2019s \ngovernment bond stock reached USD12.4 trillion in \nnominal terms, representing a 61.8% share of the total \nLCY bond market at the end of December (Table 1). \nExcept for Thailand, all government bond markets in \nthe region posted positive q-o-q growth in Q4 2020. \nNonetheless, growth in the region\u2019s government bond \nstock slowed to 3.6% q-o-q in Q4 2020 from 6.1% q-o-q \nin Q3 2020, amid weaker growth in most of the region\u2019s \ngovernment bond markets. The q-o-q growth rate \nmoderated in six out of the nine markets in the region in \nQ4 2020 versus Q3 2020, as most governments eased \ndebt issuance after aggressively raising funds to combat \nthe impacts of COVID-19 during the previous quarters. \nOn a y-o-y basis, emerging East Asia\u2019s government bond \nstock expanded 19.5% in Q4 2020, up from 17.3% in \nQ3\u00a02020. \n\nThe PRC and the Republic of Korea maintained their \npositions as the two largest government bond markets in \nthe region with a combined share of 88.3% of the region\u2019s \ngovernment bond stock at the end of December. ASEAN \neconomies held 10.4% of the region\u2019s government bond \ntotal. Among ASEAN economies, the largest government \nbond markets were those of Thailand, Indonesia, and \nSingapore. \n\nLCY corporate bonds outstanding in emerging East \u00a0Asia \nstood at USD7.7 trillion at the end of December, \naccounting for a 38.2% share of the region\u2019s total LCY \nbond market. Growth in the region\u2019s aggregate corporate \nbonds outstanding slipped to 2.2% q-o-q in Q4 2020 \nfrom 2.7% q-o-q in Q3 2020. The slower growth was due \nmainly to a growth slowdown in six of the nine markets, \nincluding the region\u2019s two biggest markets, the PRC and \nthe Republic of Korea. Nonetheless, all markets except \nfor Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand saw positive \n\nBond Market Developments in the Fourth Quarter of 2020\u200311\n\nq-o-q growth in corporate bonds outstanding in Q4 2020. \nOn a y-o-y basis, growth in the region\u2019s LCY corporate \nbond stock dipped to 16.1% in Q4 2020 from 17.6% in the \nprior quarter. Meanwhile, a Box on page 13 compares the \nexpansion of the corporate bond markets in East Asia and \nLatin America and its implications on financial resilience.\n\nAt the end of December, the corporate bond markets \nof the PRC and the Republic of Korea accounted for a \ncombined 91.2% share of emerging East Asia\u2019s corporate \nbond stock, while the corporate bond markets of \nASEAN member economies had a 6.8% share of the \nregion\u2019s corporate bond total. Among ASEAN members, \nthe largest corporate bond markets were in Malaysia, \nSingapore, and Thailand. \n\nEmerging East Asia\u2019s total LCY bond market as a share \nof the region\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) expanded \nto 97.7% at the end of December from 95.9% at the end \nof September and 83.5% at the end of December 2019 \n(Table 2). The GDP shares of both government and \ncorporate bonds rose in Q4 2020 from the previous \nquarter. \n\nThe government bonds-to-GDP share climbed to 60.4% \nfrom 59.1% during the review period, while the corporate \nbonds-to-GDP share increased to 37.3% from 36.8%. The \nhigher shares resulted from the still modest economic \ngrowth in the region while LCY bonds outstanding \nincreased as governments continued to raise funds for \nfiscal stimulus and firms issued bonds to finance their \noperations amid the reopening of regional economies. \nTaking advantage of low interest rates also remained a \nfactor for increased debt issuance in the market.\n\nAll emerging East Asian economies saw increases in their \nshare of bonds-to-GDP between Q3 2020 and Q4 2020. \nThe bond markets of the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, \nand Singapore exceeded a 100% share of their respective \neconomy\u2019s GDP at the end of Q4 2020. The PRC nearly \nbreached this level with a share of 99.8%. Meanwhile, \nViet\u00a0Nam had the region\u2019s smallest bonds-to-GDP share \nat the end of December at 26.1%. \n\nBy segment, Singapore had the largest government \nbonds-to-GDP share in the region at the end of \nDecember at 70.2%, while Viet Nam had the smallest \nat 21.6%.

An increase in bond issuances by firms accompanied \nthis growth in corporate debt. In a new study, we show stylized \nfacts on the boom in corporate debt in East Asia and Latin \nAmerica, and discuss some of the main risks associated with \nthis development (Abraham, Cortina, and Schmukler 2021).\n\nAlthough firms in both East Asia and Latin America increased \ntheir bond issuances during the 2010\u20132019 period, there \nare important differences between the two regions. Bond \nfinancing in East Asia was conducted through domestic \nmarkets and in local currency. In turn, bond financing in Latin \nAmerica was conducted through international markets and \nin foreign currency. In the median East Asian economy, 72% \nof the total amount of bonds raised per year\u2014which includes \nboth local and foreign currency issuances\u2014was issued in local \ncurrency from 2010 to 2019. This represented an increase \nof 7 percentage points relative to the annual share of local \ncurrency bond issuance from 2000 to 2007. In contrast, the \nshare of local currency bonds over the total bonds raised per \n\nyear in the median Latin American economy was 33% in the \n2010\u20132019 period. From 2000 to 2007, local currency bond \nissuances captured about 57% of the total capital raised in \nbond markets per year (Figure B1).\n\nFirms borrowing in international markets are typically \nlarger than those borrowing in domestic markets. Thus, the \ngrowth in bond market activity in East Asia comprised the \nparticipation of smaller issuing firms than in Latin America. \nIn fact, the size of the median firm issuing bonds declined \n(increased) in East Asia (Latin America) as the use of \ndomestic (international) markets expanded after the global \nfinancial crisis. In 2016, the median issuer firm in Latin \nAmerica was about 10 times larger than in East Asia.\n\nThe cost of issuing bonds declined after the global financial \ncrisis in both Latin America and East Asia, which is consistent \nwith the notion that an expansion in the supply of bond \nfinancing by investors drove the rise in bond issuance by firms. \nFrom 2010 to 2019, East Asian and Latin American firms \nissued bonds at yields that were about 25% lower than in \nthe 2000\u20132007 period. In East Asia, yields of local currency \nbonds declined more than yields of foreign currency bonds \n(26% vs. 22 %, respectively). In contrast, in Latin America, \n\nFigure B1: Domestic and Foreign Currency Corporate Bond Issuance\n\nEast Asia\n\nLatin America\n\nShare of Bonds Raised (%)\n100\n\nShare of Bonds Raised (%)\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n2005\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n2005\n\n2007\n\n2009\n\n2011\n\n2013\n\n2015\n\n2017\n\n2019\n\n2007\n\n2009\n\n2011\n\n2013\n\n2015\n\n2017\n\n2019\n\nNote: This figure shows, for each region, the share of corporate bond financing raised in local and foreign currency for the median economy each year.\nSource: Refinitiv\u2019s SDC.\n\nDomestic Currency\n\nForeign Currency\n\na \n\n This discussion box was written by Facundo Abraham, Juan J.

As \nfirms issued more bonds, their leverage positions rose and \ntheir financial performance worsened.\n\nIn the context of high debt accumulation, the economic \nand financial crisis triggered by the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic has heightened solvency risks in both \nregions. In East Asia, risks are related to the faster expansion \nin overall debt and to the fact that smaller firms, issuing \nbonds at shorter maturities, were behind the increase in \nbond issuance. In Latin America, firms are more vulnerable \n\nto changes in global market conditions than East Asian firms \nbecause they have relied more on foreign debt issued in \nforeign currency. Moreover, they have experienced larger \ncurrency depreciations than East Asian firms since the \npandemic started. \n\nReference\n\nAbraham, F., J.J. Cortina, and S.L. Schmukler.

Optimism over vaccines and a favorable \neconomic recovery likely encouraged risk-on sentiment \namong foreign investors, leading them to scale up their \nparticipation in the region\u2019s debt market.\n\nIn the PRC, foreign holdings of government bonds \nclimbed to 9.7% at the end of December, the highest \nlevel since data have been available. The growth in \nforeign ownership is a result of the rapid expansion of \nthe LCY bond market accompanied by the continued \nintegration of the PRC into global financial markets, which \nhas made it easier to facilitate foreign fund entry.

In Malaysia, \nforeign ownership of government bonds recovered to \n25.2% at the end of December, up from 23.6% at the end \nof September and nearly reaching its pre-pandemic level \nof 25.3% in December 2019. Steady foreign appetite amid \nimproving sentiment and higher yields lifted the foreign \nholdings share to match that of Indonesia, which once \nhad the region\u2019s highest rate of foreign participation in \nthe government bond market. In the Philippines, foreign \ninvestors\u2019 share of sovereign debt nearly doubled to 2.7% \nthe end of December from 1.5% at the end of September, \nalthough this was still below its level before the COVID-19 \noutbreak. \n\nIn Viet Nam, the share of foreign holdings was barely \nchanged at the end of December from the previous \nquarter at 0.6%. While Viet Nam has been one of the \nmost successful countries in managing the COVID-19 \npandemic and has experienced a solid economic \nrecovery, foreign participation in its local government \nbond market is still far from pre-pandemic levels. One \nreason for the slow return of foreign interest is the small \nsize of Viet Nam\u2019s bond market, which makes it an \nunappealing investment option for offshore investors.\n\nThe foreign ownership share of government bonds fell \nin both Indonesia and Thailand. In Indonesia, the share \ndeclined 1.8 percentage points in Q4 2020 from the \nprevious quarter to 25.2% at the end of December and \nwas down 13.4 percentage points from a year earlier. \nAlthough offshore investors seemed to have regained \nconfidence in the Indonesian market as evidenced by the \npositive fund inflows in Q4 2020, foreign participation \nremained well below the pre-pandemic level of 39.0%. \nA large amount of the government debt issued is being \nabsorbed by local investors including the central bank. \nIn Thailand, subdued foreign fund inflows in Q4 2020 \non the back of low investment returns translated into a \ndecrease in the foreign holdings share to 13.6% at the end \nof December from 14.0% at the end of September.\n\nIn the Republic of Korea, the foreign holdings share \nincreased to 13.3% at the end of September from 13.0% \nat the end of June.

The region received \ntotal net inflows of USD39.5 billion, which was slightly \nreduced by net outflows of USD0.8 billion from the \nRepublic of Korea\u2019s bond market. The amount of foreign \nfunds that entered the region in Q4 2020 showed a \nstrong recovery from what the region experienced in the \nfirst\u00a0quarter of 2020 when investors panicked in the wake \nof the COVID-19 outbreak and sold off USD4.3 billion of \nemerging East Asian government debt. \n\nFigure 3: Foreign Bond Flows in Select Emerging  \nEast Asian Economies\n\nUSD billion\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201315\n\n\u201320\n\nJan\n-20\n\nFeb\n-20\n\nMar\n-20\n\nApr\n-20\n\nMay\n-20\n\nJun\n-20\n\nJul\n-20\n\nAug\n-20\n\nSep\n-20\n\nOct\n-20\n\nNov\n-20\n\nDec\n-20\n\nJan\n-21\n\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of\nMalaysia\n\nIndonesia\nPhilippines\n\nKorea, Rep. of\nThailand\n\nUSD = United States dollar.\nNotes:\n1.

The \nsustained strong inflows were also a result of governments \ncontinuing to issue a considerable amount of debt to \nprovide stimulus to the economy, while returns remained \nrelatively higher in most markets in the region compared \nto advanced economies like the United States (US), \nmaking emerging East Asian assets attractive.\n\nThe PRC registered net inflows of USD31.3 billion in \nQ4\u00a02020, the largest quarterly foreign buying in any \nquarter in 2020. In September, FTSE Russell announced \nit would include the PRC in its World Government Bond \nIndex in October 2021.

In January 2021, \nforeign investors purchased a net USD18.8 billion of PRC \ngovernment debt, the highest monthly inflows since data \nare available, which indicates foreign investors are building \ntheir positions in the PRC\u2019s government bond market \nin the run-up to its inclusion in the FTSE Russell World \nGovernment Bond Index.\n\nMalaysia and Indonesia were the largest recipients of \nforeign funds in the region after the PRC in Q4 2020. \nThe\u00a0inflows were underpinned by attractive yields and \nfurther boosted by low inflation, strong currencies, and \nimproving sentiment over the economic recovery amid \nvaccination program rollouts. \n\nIn Malaysia, foreign investors bought a net USD3.7\u00a0billion \nof LCY government debt in Q4 2020. The impact of \nthe sovereign ratings downgrade by Fitch Ratings in \nDecember was relatively muted, with inflows accelerating \nto USD0.9 billion in December from USD0.6 billion \nin November. The appetite for Malaysian government \nbonds remained sturdy through January, even with a spike \nof COVID-19 cases during the month, with net foreign \nbuying amounting to USD0.9 billion. In Indonesia, inflows \nwere at USD2.9 billion in Q4 2020, reversing net outflows \nof USD0.3 billion in the preceding quarter. In January, net \nforeign fund inflows registered USD1.0 billion. \n\nThe Philippines had net foreign fund inflows of \nUSD1.9\u00a0billion in Q4 2020, reversing the USD0.3 billion \noutflow in Q3 2020 and marking the first quarterly net \ninflows since December 2018. The improvement is \ntraced to the gradual reopening of the economy. While \n\nBond Market Developments in the Fourth Quarter of 2020\u200317\n\nthe Philippines registered inward fund flows of about \nUSD1.0\u00a0billion each in October and November, net inflows \ndwindled in December to only USD36.9\u00a0million. In January \n2021, foreign funds amounting to USD0.2\u00a0billion fled \nthe government bond market amid uncertainty over the \neconomic recovery given the detection of new COVID-19 \nvariants and concerns over the arrival of vaccines.\n\nThailand had the smallest foreign fund inflows among \nthe region\u2019s LCY government bonds markets in Q4 2020. \nInflows amounted to only USD0.6 billion, down by more \nthan half from USD1.5 billion in Q3 2020. Inflows in \nNovember were partly offset by outflows in October \nand December. In January 2021, Thailand registered \nvery modest net inflows of USD3.9 million. Low returns \non Thai government bonds, characterized by the small \nspread against US Treasuries, made them unattractive to \nforeign investors.\n\nIn contrast to other economies in the region, the \nRepublic\u00a0of Korea saw foreign funds retreat from its \ngovernment bond market in Q4 2020, with outflows \namounting to USD0.8 billion. Outflows were seen in \nNovember and December totaling USD1.0 billion, which \noffset the inflows in October. Most of the outflow was \nassociated with the repatriation of funds from matured \nshort-term securities as well as profit-taking toward the \nend of the year. In January 2021, the Republic of Korea\u2019s \ngovernment debt market saw the reentry of foreign fund \ninflows of USD1.0 billion, which may be indicative of the \nreinvestment of proceeds.\n\nLCY Bond Issuance\n\nLCY bond issuance in Emerging East Asia \nreached USD2.0 trillion in Q4 2020. \n\nLCY bond sales in emerging East Asia moderated to \nUSD2.0 trillion in Q4 2020. On a q-o-q basis, bond \nissuance contracted 14.7% q-o-q following a 6.4%\u00a0q-o-q \nexpansion in Q3 2020 (Table 3). Due to a high base \neffect in the previous two quarters, issuance in Q4\u00a02020 \ndeclined across all bond types except for central bank \nissuance, which recorded a slight uptick. Despite \ngrowth slowing down, gross issuance volume for the \nregion was still higher than pre-COVID-19 levels, as the \npandemic led to increased borrowing by governments \nand corporates. This highlights the importance of bond \nfinancing in capital raising for the needs of the public and \nprivate sectors.\n\n\f18\u2003Asia Bond Monitor March 2021\n\nTable 3:

Other \nregional markets that posted lower issuance activities in \nQ4 2020 versus Q3 2020 were Malaysia, Thailand, and \nViet Nam. In contrast, quarterly issuance volumes rose in \nHong Kong China; Indonesia; the Republic of Korea; the \nPhilippines; and Singapore. \n\nOn a y-o-y basis, issuance volume climbed at a slower \npace of 32.0% in Q4 2020 compared with a 39.9% \nexpansion in Q3 2020. Nearly all emerging East Asian \nbond markets recorded positive y-o-y growth in bond \nissuance, with Thailand and Viet Nam as the exceptions. \nBoth markets recorded y-o-y contractions during the \nreview period. Growth on a y-o-y basis quickened in \nHong\u00a0Kong, China; Indonesia; Malaysia; the Philippines; \nand Singapore; while it moderated in the PRC and the \nRepublic of Korea. \n\na 61.1% share in Q3 2020, largely due to the PRC\u2019s \ndecline. Total LCY government bond issuance reached \nUSD1,092.8\u00a0billion, with growth contracting 23.5% q-o-q \nbut rising 47.3% y-o-y. Treasury instruments and other \ngovernment bonds form the bulk of government bonds, \nrepresenting a 67.8% share of the aggregate government \nbond issuance volume during the quarter in review. \nGrowth declined 31.3% q-o-q in Q4 2020 but was up \n81.7% y-o-y, as governments borrowed more in 2020 to \nfund pandemic stimulus programs. As in previous years, \nissuance volume slowed in the last quarter of the year as \na majority of borrowing requirements have already been \nfulfilled earlier. On a y-o-y basis, all regional bond markets \nposted higher issuance growth for Treasury and other \ngovernment bonds in Q4 2020 versus Q3 2020 except \nfor the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and \nThailand.  For Singapore, there was no change in the \nvolume of issuance from the prior year. \n\nGovernment bonds accounted for 54.8% of the aggregate \nissuance volume during the quarter, declining from \n\nOn the other hand, issuance of central bank instruments \ninched up 0.2% q-o-q in Q4 2020, which was down from \n\n\f20\u2003Asia Bond Monitor March 2021\n\nan 8.4% q-o-q uptick in the preceding quarter. Growth \nwas fueled by increased issuance by Bank Indonesia, \nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, and MAS. All other regional \ncentral banks tapered their issuance during the quarter \nversus that of Q3 2020, while Bank Negara Malaysia and \nthe State Bank of Vietnam ceased issuance of central \nbank instruments. \n\nCorporate bond issuance in regional markets contracted \n0.9% q-o-q in Q4 2020, following a 0.6% q-o-q drop \nin Q3 2020. More active issuance from corporates in \nHong\u00a0Kong, China; the Republic of Korea; and Malaysia \nwas observed during Q4 2020 versus Q3 2020. On the \nother hand, corporates from the PRC, Indonesia, the \nPhilippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam issued \nless. On a y-o-y basis, corporate bond issuance grew \n17.3% in Q4 2020, slowing from a 24.2% rise in the \nearlier\u00a0quarter.\n\nThe PRC was still the largest source of LCY bond \nissuance in emerging East Asia, albeit its share of \nthe total fell to 64.9% in Q4 2020 from 70.0% in \nthe prior quarter. Bond issuance volume in the PRC \nreached USD1,293.7\u00a0billion in Q4 2020 on a decline of \n21.0%\u00a0q-o-q after rising 6.9%\u00a0q-o-q in Q3 2020. Both \nthe q-o-q growth for government and corporate bonds \ncontracted during the review period. The decline in \ngovernment bonds was due largely to reduced issuance \nby local governments and policy banks. The quota for \nlocal government bond issuance had been mostly tapped \nby the end of Q3 2020, leading to less issuance for such \nbonds in Q4 2020. In addition, local governments were \nonly given until October by the government to utilize \nthe quota for the issuance of bonds under this program. \nOn the other hand, issuance of Treasury instruments \ninched up 2.4%\u00a0q-o-q during the review period. Issuance \nof corporate bonds fell 4.4%\u00a0q-o-q after a marginal \nincrease of 0.2% q-o-q in Q3\u00a02020, amid cautious \ndemand over corporate default rates and the possibility \nof increased oversight by government. Compared with \nthe same period a year earlier, the PRC\u2019s issuance volume \ngrew 45.5% y-oy in Q4\u00a02020, down from 52.5% y-o-y in \nQ3\u00a02020. \n\nIn the Republic of Korea, issuance activities were actively \nbuoyed by the corporate bond segment. Total LCY \nbond issuance rose to USD210.2 billion in Q4 2020, \nwith growth rebounding 3.2% q-o-q from a decline of \n11.5% q-o-q in the prior quarter. Corporate bonds drove \ngrowth as issuance climbed 17.3% q-o-q, after posting \n\ndeclines in the previous 3 quarters. Growth in corporate \nbond issuance was buoyed by an improving economic \noutlook and corporates locking in low funding costs ahead \nof a projected rise in interest rates in 2021. In contrast, \nissuance of government bonds weakened by 14.3% q-o-q \nin Q4 2020. In terms of volume, however, issuance of \ngovernment bonds remained higher than pre-COVID-19 \nlevels and y-o-y growth in Q4 2020 remained at double-\ndigit levels (23.0%). The government approved four \nsupplementary budgets in 2020, necessitating the need \nfor much higher issuance volume to support COVID-19 \nstimulus measures. On an annual basis, LCY bond \nissuance in the Republic of Korea grew 0.7% y-o-y in \nQ4\u00a02020, down from 12.6% y-o-y in Q3 2020.\n\nLCY bond sales in Hong Kong, China tallied \nUSD145.2\u00a0billion in Q4 2020, with growth tapering to \n0.4% q-o-q from 5.2% q-o-q in Q3 2020.

The largest sources of LCY bond \nissuance among ASEAN members in Q4 2020 were \nSingapore, Thailand, and Indonesia. \n\nTotal LCY bonds sales from Singapore stood at \nUSD163.8\u00a0billion during the quarter, with growth \nslipping to 6.7% q-o-q in Q4 2020 from 7.5% q-o-q \nin Q3\u00a02020.

On a y-o-y basis, \nissuance volume increased 23.3% in Q4 2020 from 18.9% \nin Q3 2020. \n\nIn Thailand, LCY bond issuance summed to \nUSD74.4\u00a0billion, with all bond types posting double-digit \ncontractions in issuance during Q4 2020. Bond issuance \ndeclined 24.4% q-o-q in Q4 2020 after a 20.9% q-o-q \nhike in Q3 2020. The largest decline was seen in the \nissuance of central bank instruments, which slumped \n27.4% q-o-q in Q4 2020 as the central bank boosted \nliquidity. Issuance of Treasury and other government \nbonds fell 19.4% q-o-q, while corporate bonds issuance \ndeclined 14.6% q-o-q. Some corporates held off their \nissuance plans, opting to borrow from banks due to lower \nborrowing costs. On an annual basis, bond issuance fell \n4.8% y-o-y in Q4 2020 following growth of 23.4% y-o-y \nin\u00a0Q3 2020.\n\nLCY bond sales in Indonesia remained active through \nthe fourth quarter, as the government continued to \nissue bonds to support its economy amid the COVID-19 \noutbreak. In past years, Indonesia normally cancels \nTreasury auctions by the middle of November, but its last \nauction for 2020 went into December. Total issuance in \nQ4 2020 tallied USD47.2 billion on growth of 7.6% q-o-q, \ndown from a 44.0% q-o-q hike in Q3 2020. The volumes \nof issuance for Treasury bills and bonds were broadly at \npar with the issuance recorded in Q3 2020. In addition, \nBank Indonesia issued more shari\u2019ah-compliant central \nbank instruments during the quarter, as it implemented \na number of changes to strengthen shari\u2019ah monetary \noperations. In contrast, corporate bond issuance dropped \n42.5% q-o-q in Q4 2020. On a y-o-y basis, bond issuance \nmore than doubled in Q4 2020, with growth accelerating \nto 126.3% from 78.4% in Q3 2020. \n\nIn Malaysia, bond issuance in Q4 2020 stood at \nUSD22.3\u00a0billion, broadly unchanged from its level \nin Q3\u00a02020. Overall, growth was marginally down \n0.3%\u00a0q-o-q in Q4 2020 after declining 4.5% q-o-q in the \npreceding quarter. Similar with the Republic of Korea, \nthe source of growth came from the corporate bond \nsegment. During the quarter, issuance of government \nbonds dropped due to a decline in the issuance of \nTreasury instruments and the absence of issuance from \nBank Negara Malaysia. On an annual basis, bond issuance \ninched up 7.2% y-o-y in Q4 2020 from 6.3% y-o-y in \nQ3\u00a02020. \n\nBond Market Developments in the Fourth Quarter of 2020\u200321\n\nIn the Philippines, total bond sales grew 13.2% q-o-q \nto USD29.1 billion in Q4 2020.

Q-o-q bond issuance growth was driven solely by \ncentral bank bonds, which rose more than 1,000% as the \ncentral bank sterilized foreign capital inflows. Q4 2020 \nbond issuance was still higher compared to pre-pandemic \nlevels due to the need to fund stimulus measures. Bond \nissuance was higher by 268.5% y-o-y, driven mostly by a \n390.9% y-o-y rise in government bonds. \n\nIn Viet Nam, total bond issuance declined 6.8% q-o-q \nin Q4 2020 to USD7.4 billion after rising 34.3% q-o-q \nin the prior quarter. While government bond issuance \ngrew 7.3% q-o-q, overall issuance was dragged down \nby a 31.6%\u00a0q-o-q decline in corporate bond issuance. \nViet\u00a0Nam\u2019s corporate bond issuance continued to be \nweak, as the government tightened corporate bond \nissuance standards in Q4 2020. On an annual basis, \nViet\u00a0Nam\u2019s bond issuance declined 66.5% y-o-y in \nQ4\u00a02020 following a decline of 63.7% y-o-y in Q3 2020.\n\nCross-Border Bond Issuance\n\nEmerging East Asia\u2019s cross-border bond \nissuance reached USD2.9 billion in Q4 2020.\n\nEmerging East Asia\u2019s total intra-regional bond issuance \nreached USD2.9 billion in Q4 2020, a 53.9% q-o-q \nincrease from the USD1.9 billion raised in the previous \nquarter.

However, issuance dropped \nto USD394.8 million in December. From the same period \nin 2019, total intra-regional bond issuance increased \n28.4%. \n\nThe PRC registered the highest aggregate issuance \nvolume of USD2.4 billion in Q4 2020, dominating the \nmarket with a share of 81.7% (Figure 4).

The \nexpansion was due to higher G3 issuance volumes in \nmost of the region\u2019s economies compared with a year \nearlier.

Figures were computed based on 31 December 2020 currency exchange rates \n\nand do not include currency effects.\n\nSource: AsianBondsOnline calculations based on Bloomberg LP data.\n\nIn 2020, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China issued \nthe largest G3 currency bond with a USD2.9\u00a0billion \nperpetual USD-denominated bond issued in September. \nAs the COVID-19 pandemic affected global financial \nmarkets, the March\u2013May period saw the least G3\u00a0currency \nbond issuance in emerging East Asia. Issuances of \nG3\u00a0currency bonds picked up during the second half of \n2020 as global financial market sentiment improved.\n\nGovernment Bond Yield Curves\n\nLocal currency government bond yields rose at \nthe longer-end of the curve for most emerging \nEast Asian economies on the back of improved \ninvestor sentiment over the global economic \nrecovery.\n\nIn Q4 2020, the outlook for the global economy largely \nimproved as economies started easing quarantine \nmeasures and several drug makers released positive \nclinical trial results for their respective COVID-19 \nvaccines. The advent of the clinical trial results also \nallowed several economies to begin vaccination measures.\n\nthat the weaknesses were expected to be transitory \nand the economic growth outlook was much improved, \nleading to an upgrade in economic forecasts.\n\nIn the US, economic growth tapered in Q4 2020, with \nGDP growing at annual rate of 4.1% versus 33.4% in \nQ3 2020. However, other economic data showed \nimprovements with nonfarm payrolls improving in \nJanuary, with additions of 166,000 following a decline \nof 306,000 in December 2020. In February, nonfarm \npayrolls further improved, increasing 379,000. The \nunemployment rate fell to 6.2% in February, from 6.3% \nand 6.7% in January and December, respectively. Retail \nsales also gained 7.6% month-on-month after falling \n1.0%\u00a0month-on-month in\u00a0December.\n\nIn addition, the US Federal Reserve upgraded its economic \nprojection in December from the previous September \nforecast, raising its 2021 GDP growth forecast\u00a0to 4.2% from \n4.0% and its 2022 forecast to 3.2% from 3.0%, The Federal \nReserve also left its monetary policy unchanged during \nboth its 15\u201316 December and 26\u201327\u00a0January meetings.\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB), during its \n10\u00a0December meeting, left its key policy rates unchanged \nbut raised its pandemic emergency monthly purchase \nprogram by EUR500 billion to EUR1,850 billion and \nextended the duration to March 2022 from June 2021. \nThe euro area\u2019s GDP declined 4.9% y-o-y in Q4 2020 \nafter a decline of 4.2% y-o-y in Q3 2020. Unlike the US, \nthe ECB downgraded its GDP forecasts in December \nfrom those in September. The 2021 GDP growth forecast \nwas adjusted to 3.9% in 2021 from 5.0%. The 2022 GDP \nforecast was adjusted to 4.2% from 3.2%. However, the \nECB said that it is somewhat optimistic that the medium-\nterm outlook would improve over the ongoing vaccination \nprograms in the region.\n\nThe Bank of Japan largely left monetary policy unchanged \nduring its 17 December meeting but adjusted the duration \nof its purchase program for commercial paper and \ncorporate bonds by 6 months to the end of September \n2021. Japan also had positive annualized GDP growth in \nQ4 2020 of 11.7% after a 22.8% gain in the third quarter. \nLikewise, the Bank of Japan upgraded the 2021 GDP \nforecast to 3.9% in from 3.6% and the 2022 forecast to \n1.8% from 1.6%. \n\nWhile there was some economic weakness in Q4 2020, \ncentral banks, particularly in advanced economies, noted \n\nThe improving outlook for the global economy also \npushed yields upward in emerging East Asia between \n\n\fBond Market Developments in the Fourth Quarter of 2020\u200327\n\n31\u00a0December and 15 February. For the 2-year maturities, \nyields rose for most economies in emerging East Asia \nwith the exception of the Republic of Korea (Figure 7a). \nThe steepest increase in the 2-year yield was in Indonesia \n(Figure\u00a07b). After consistent declines for most of 2020, \nthe 2-year yields spiked in Indonesia at the start of 2021.\n\nIn the same period, 10-year yields also showed a similar \npattern, but with much steeper increases for most \nemerging East Asian markets. Unlike its 2-year yield, \nthe Republic of Korea\u2019s 10-year yield trended upward \n(Figure\u00a08a). While Indonesia\u2019s 10-year yield rose, the \n\ngain was not as steep compared to the 2-year yield \n(Figure\u00a08b). Viet Nam was the sole exception to the \nrise in 10-year yields, as it trended downward on strong \nmarket\u00a0demand.\n\nThe improved economic outlook also led to a steepening \nof yield curves in emerging East Asia between \n31\u00a0December and 15 February (Figure 9).

Only Viet Nam was the exception, as its yield \ncurve shifted upward at the shorter-end but downward \nat the longer-end. Rising global inflationary concerns due \nto past stimulus measures, however, may place further \npressure on yields.\n\nThe 2-year versus 10-year yield spread widened for nearly \nall markets during the review period except in the PRC, \nwhere it was unchanged, and in Indonesia, Thailand, and \nViet Nam, where it narrowed (Figure 10).\n\nNearly all emerging East Asian economies posted \nnegative y-o-y growth rates in Q4 2020. The two \nexceptions were the PRC, which posted its third straight \nquarter of positive\u00a0GDP growth, and Viet Nam, which \nhad positive quarterly GDP growth rates throughout \n2020. While the remaining markets posted negative \ny-o-y GDP growth rates in Q4 2020, consistent with the \nimproving economic outlook and easing of quarantine \nmeasures, GDP mostly declined at a smaller y-o-y pace \ncompared to the previous quarter. The exceptions were \nthe Republic\u00a0of\u00a0Korea, which posted a 1.4% y-o-y decline \nin Q4 2020 after a 1.1% y-o-y decline in Q3 2020, and \nMalaysia, which posted a 3.4% y-o-y decline following a \n2.6% y-o-y decline in the same period.\n\nInflation rates continued to be subdued in emerging \nEast Asia in 2020 due to the economic downturn, with \n\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of\n\nHong Kong, China\n\nIndonesia\n\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nMalaysia\n\nPhilippines\n\nSingapore\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\nUnited States\n\nEuropean Union\n\nJapan\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nBasis points\n\n15-Feb-21\n\n31-Dec-20\n\nSource: AsianBondsOnline computations based on Bloomberg LP data.\n\nFigure 11a: Headline Inflation Rates\n\nFigure 11b: Headline Inflation Rates\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n%\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20133\n\n1.90\n\n1.55\n\n0.20\n\n\u20130.34\n\n\u20130.97\n\n4.20\n\n0.60\n\n\u20130.20\n\n\u20130.30\n\n\u20130.60\n\n\u20134\nJan-20 Mar-20 May-20\n\nJul-20\n\nSep-20 Nov-20\n\nJan-21\n\n\u20134\nJan-20 Mar-20 May-20\n\nJul-20\n\nSep-20 Nov-20\n\nJan-21\n\nHong Kong, China\nIndonesia\nSingapore\n\nThailand\nViet Nam\n\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of\nJapan\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nMalaysia\nPhilippines\n\nNote: Data as of 31 January 2021.\nSource: Based on data from Bloomberg LP.\n\nNote: Data as of 31 January 2021.\nSource: Based on data from Bloomberg LP.\n\n\f30\u2003Asia Bond Monitor March 2021\n\nFigure 12a: Policy Rates\n\nFigure 12b: Policy Rates\n\n%\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\nFeb-20\n\n%\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\nFeb-20\n\n2.00\n\n1.75\n\n0.50\n\n0.50\n\nApr-20\n\nJun-20\n\nSep-20\n\nNov-20\n\nFeb-21\n\nApr-20\n\nJun-20\n\nSep-20\n\nNov-20\n\nFeb-21\n\nKorea, Rep. of\nMalaysia\n\nPhilippines\nThailand\n\nNote: Data as of 15 February 2021.\nSource: Based on data from Bloomberg LP.\n\n4.00\n\n3.75\n\n2.95\n\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of\nIndonesia\n\nViet Nam\n\nNotes:\n1.

While the 1-year benchmark lending rate \nis the official policy rate of the People\u2019s Bank of China, market players use the \n1-year medium-term lending facility rate as a guide for the monetary policy \ndirection of the People\u2019s Bank of China.\nSource: Based on data from Bloomberg LP.\n\nof Korea. Only the Philippines showed a sharp rise in \ninflation due to supply side issues (Figure\u00a011b).\n\nAfter having eased policy rates in the early part of 2020, \nall emerging East Asian central banks opted to leave \nmonetary policy rates unchanged during the review period \nin order to assess the impact of previous monetary easing \nand given the improved economic outlook (Figures\u00a012a \nand 12b). However, Bank Indonesia on 18\u00a0February, \nreduced its policy rate by 25 basis points to support \neconomic growth, and it downgraded its forecast for 2021 \ndomestic growth to a range of 4.3%\u20135.3% from 4.8%\u2013\n5.8%. Central banks in the region, however, may tighten \nmonetary policy moving forward should inflation rise this \nyear. In addition, the US recently passed a USD1.9 trillion \nstimulus bill, which could lead to a rise in US interest rates \n\nand subsequent tightening by the Federal Reserve. Other \ncentral banks might also follow to maintain parity and to \navoid capital outflows.\n\nCorporate spread fell on improved economic \noutlook.\n\nThe AAA-rated corporate versus government yield \nspread fell in all markets for which data are available \nbetween 31 December and 15 February on the back of \nimproving investor optimism as confidence in the global \neconomy grew (Figure 13a). \n\nFor lower-rated corporate bonds, the spreads were largely \nunchanged in the Republic of Korea and Thailand, but \ndeclined in the PRC and Malaysia (Figure 13b).\n\n\fBond Market Developments in the Fourth Quarter of 2020\u200331\n\nFigure 13a: Credit Spreads\u2014Local Currency Corporates Rated AAA vs. Government Bonds\n\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of\n\nMalaysia\n\n0.0\n\n0\n\n%\n1.2\n\n0.9\n\n0.6\n\n0.3\n\n%\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n%\n11.8\n\n11.6\n\n11.4\n\n11.2\n\n11.0\n\n0\n\n%\n4.7\n\n3.9\n\n3.1\n\n2.3\n\n1.5\n\n0.5\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\n32\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\nTime to maturity (years)\n\nTime to maturity (years)\n\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nThailand\n\n1.5\n\n2.5\n\n3.5\n\n4.5\n\n5.5\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\nTime to maturity (years)\n\nTime to maturity (years)\n\n15-Feb-21\n\n31-Dec-20 \n\nNotes:\n1.

The HKMA noted that the latest \ndata based on indicators from the third quarter of 2020 \nsignaled the need for a higher CCyB of 2.5%. However, \nthe HKMA determined that, considering the high level of \nuncertainty facing the economy, it was more appropriate \nto hold the CCyB steady at 1.0% and continue to monitor \nthe economic situation. A lower CCyB releases additional \nliquidity into the banking system by raising banks\u2019 lending \ncapacity to support the economy. The CCyB is an integral \npart of the Basel III regulatory capital framework designed \nto increase the resilience of the banking sector in periods \nof excess credit growth. \n\nIndonesia\n\nOn 2 December, the National Assembly of the Republic \nof Korea passed the KRW558.0 trillion 2021 budget. \nThe total was KRW2.2 trillion higher than the proposed \nbudget, which included a KRW7.5 trillion increase in \nallocation for policies related to easing the impact of the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and other \nnational priorities, while KRW5.3 trillion was removed \nfrom other programs. The 2021 budget is expected \nto result in a fiscal deficit of KRW75.4 trillion, or the \nequivalent of 3.7% of gross domestic product.\n\nRepublic of Korea Announces 2021 \nEconomic\u00a0Outlook and Policies\n\nOn 21 December, the Government of the Republic of \nKorea announced its economic outlook for 2021 along \nwith its economic policies. The domestic economy \nis projected to grow 3.2% year-on-year on the back \nof improvements in domestic demand and export \nperformance. Inflation is also expected to rise to 1.1% in \n2021 from 0.5% in 2020. Economic policies in 2021 will \nfocus on helping the economy regain growth momentum \nand supporting programs that will promote innovation \nand sustainable development. These include addressing \ncontinued uncertainties arising from the pandemic via \nexpansionary fiscal policies to promote growth, vaccine \ndistribution, and disease prevention. \n\nBank Indonesia Improves Calculation \nMethodology for the Jakarta Interbank \nSpot\u00a0Dollar Rate\n\nGovernment Announces Measures  \nto Strengthen Foreign Exchange Liquidity  \nfor Nonbank Financial Institutions\n\nIn February, Bank Indonesia announced a new regulation \nto improve the accuracy and relevancy of the Jakarta \nInterbank Spot Dollar Rate (JISDOR) and to align with \ninternational standards. The regulation, which will come \ninto effect on 5 April 2021, calls for extending the data \ncollection window for spot transactions used in the \ncalculation of JISDOR and adjusting the publishing time \nof the JISDOR from morning to afternoon. \n\nOn 20 January, the Government of the Republic of Korea \nannounced plans to further improve foreign exchange \n(FX) liquidity management and support mechanisms, \nparticularly for nonbank financial institutions. This was \nthe result of a short-term dollar shortage experienced in \nMarch 2020 amid the sudden impact of the pandemic on \nfinancial markets. Measures include a closer monitoring \nof nonbank financial institutions\u2019 risk management of \n\n\fPolicy and Regulatory Developments\u200333\n\nFX liquidity and derivatives transactions, introduction \nof three new indicators to assess FX liquidity, and \nimprovements in existing regulations.

The new reference rate will eventually replace, \nor be used together with, the current Kuala Lumpur \nInterbank Offered Rate as the committee deliberates \nits continued use. The move is in line with the Financial \nStability Board\u2019s recommendation encouraging financial \nbenchmark reforms around the world to improve the \nintegrity of global reference rates.\n\nBank Negara Malaysia Extends Statutory \nReserve Requirement Rule\n\nOn 20 January, Bank Negara Malaysia extended until \nthe end of 2022 the policy of allowing banks to utilize \nMalaysian Government Securities and Government \nInvestment Issues to meet the 2.0% statutory reserve \nrequirement threshold. The extension aims to promote \nbank liquidity to support their activities during the \npandemic.\n\nPhilippines\n\nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Approves Another \nPHP540 Billion Loan to the Government\n\nOn 28 December, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas \napproved another PHP540 billion loan to the central \ngovernment to augment its pandemic funds. The loan \nwill be settled within 3 months, which can be extended \nfor another 3 months, and bears no interest. This is \nthe third advance to the government from the central \nbank following the loans granted in March and October \n\nOn 17 February, the Financial Institutions Strategic \nTransfer Act was signed into law. The act will allow \nfinancial institutions like banks to offload nonperforming \nassets to asset management companies, thereby \nimproving financial institutions\u2019 liquidity to allow them to \nprovide more credit to businesses. The law will ease the \nnonperforming loan ratios of banks, which have increased \nas a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSingapore\n\nSingapore to Transition from Swap Offer  \nRate and Singapore Interbank Offer Rate  \nto Singapore Overnight Rate Average\n\nIn December, Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) \nempowered the committee in charge of overseeing \nthe economy\u2019s transition from the Swap Offer Rate \nand Singapore Interbank Offer Rate to the Singapore \nOvernight Rate Average. The move came as the \nAssociation of Banks in Singapore, the Singapore Foreign \nExchange Market Committee, and the steering committee \nrecommended last year to discontinue the use of  the \nSingapore Interbank Offer Rate in favor of the Singapore \nOvernight Rate Average.\n\nMonetary Authority of Singapore and Federal \nReserve Extend Bilateral Swap Agreement\n\nIn December, MAS and the United States (US) \nFederal Reserve extended to 30 September 2021 their \nUSD60\u00a0billion bilateral swap agreement. In line with this, \nMAS also extended to 30 September the duration of \nits US dollar facility, which offers up to USD60 billion in \nfunding to banks. The swap agreement aims to enhance \nUS dollar lending to businesses in Singapore to support \ntheir operations during the pandemic. The effort also \nensures financial liquidity and stability.\n\n\f34\u2003Asia Bond Monitor March 2021\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\nBank Indonesia and the Bank of Thailand \nExpand Local Currency Settlement Framework\n\nGovernment of Viet Nam Issues  \nNew Corporate Bond Market Regulation\n\nOn 21 December, Bank Indonesia and the Bank of \nThailand announced the expansion of the rupiah\u2013baht \nsettlement framework as part of continuing efforts to \npromote wider use of local currencies to facilitate trade \nand investment between Indonesia and Thailand. Direct \ninvestment is now included as an underlying transaction \ncovered by the local currency settlement framework. \nRelevant foreign exchange rules and regulations were \nalso relaxed through more flexible documentation \nrequirements. The two central banks appointed additional \ncommercial banks in their respective countries to support \nthe implementation of the expanded rupiah\u2013baht \nsettlement framework. \n\nOn 31 October, the Government of Viet Nam issued \nDecree No. 153/2020/ND-CP, which regulates the \nprivate offering and trading of corporate bonds in the \ndomestic market and the offering of corporate bonds \nin the international market effective 1 January 2021. \nThis replaced Decree No. 81/2020/ND-CP that came \ninto effect on 1 September 2020.

In June \n2020, the ICMA expanded its list of eligible projects and \ntarget communities relevant to social bonds in response \nto the rapid growth of the social bond market amid the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. \n\nDriven by growing investor demand for instruments \nthat deliver ESG value, equity and bond markets have \ninnovated over the past 2 decades to develop a number \nof sustainable finance instruments. The global bond \nmarkets have embraced this movement; ESG-linked \nbond issuance jumped 33% year-on-year (y-o-y) to \nUSD330\u00a0billion in 2019 and another 58% y-o-y to \nUSD522 billion in 2020, while outstanding ESG bonds \npassed the USD1\u00a0trillion threshold in the middle of 2020. \nThe ESG market initially was dominated by green bonds, \nbut social bonds experienced exceptional growth in 2020, \npartly due to the to the strong demand for social bonds \nto finance activities that mitigate the fallout from the \npandemic.\n\nThis development is ushering in a new era of explosive \ngrowth for ESG-labeled bonds in general and social bonds \nin particular.\n\nEconomic and social development needs in developing \nAsia highlight the urgency\u2014as well as the opportunity\u2014\nfor creating a robust social bond market in the region. \nWith the stunning impact of COVID-19 still unfolding, \nthe Asian Development Bank assesses that the pandemic \nhas already taken a heavy toll on the region\u2019s developing \neconomies. In December 2020, the Asian Development \nBank forecast that developing Asia\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct would contract by 0.4% in 2020, the region\u2019s \nweakest economic performance since 1961.11 This is \nexpected to be followed by a 6.8% expansion in 2021, \nwith downside risks\u2014rather than upside potential\u2014\nprevailing.\n\nThe fallout from the pandemic has been \ndisproportionately damaging to vulnerable and \nunderserved people and communities throughout \nthe region, as vital areas such as tourism, the informal \neconomy, and small and medium-sized enterprises \n(SMEs) in particular have been affected. This has \nexacerbated the funding gap needed to attain the \nUnited Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals. \nPrior to the pandemic, the UN warned that developing \neconomies in Asia and the Pacific faced an annual \nfunding gap of USD1.5 trillion compared with what was \nneeded to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. \nRecent developments underscore the opportunity for \nsocial bonds to help close this funding gap by financing \nsocial investments and improving the quality of project \noutcomes through a commitment to measuring and \nreporting impact.\n\nGlobal social bond issuance saw tremendous growth \nin 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic and economic \n\n10\u2002 This section was written by Jason Mortimer (Head of Sustainable Investment\u2014Fixed Income) at Nomura Asset Management and Jane Hughes (Professor) at Simmons University \n(United States).

From 2017 to 2019, annual \nAsian social bond issuance grew from 12% to 38% of the \nglobal total (excluding supranational issuance) before \nfalling back to 23% in 2020 due to exceptionally high \nissuance from Europe, particularly France. However, \nAsia is now consistently the second most active region \nin terms of social bond issuance, as annual issuance \ngrew 22.3 times from 2017 to 2020, compared with \ngrowth of 9.8 times for Europe and 14.3 times for global \nissuance excluding Asia. Nonetheless, the Asian social \nbond market is still less than half the size of the European \nmarket, and the need\u2014and opportunity\u2014for even \nfaster growth is apparent. In the Asia social bond market, \nissuance so far has been dominated by government-\nrelated agency issuers in high-income economies such \nas Japan and the Republic of Korea, where such issuance \nmakes up 41% and 48% of the entire outstanding Asian \nsocial bond market, respectively (Figure 20).\n\nWhile philanthropic and supranational institutions are \nsignificant issuers of social bonds, they also help to \ndevelop the market ecosystem and support prospective \nparticipants to enter the market. Governments, including \nboth policymakers and regulators, also are key to \necosystem development. Together, these groups can \nprovide market education, technical assistance, thought \n\nFigure 20: Share of Asian ICMA-Compliant Social and Green Bond Issuance by Income Level and Economy, 2017\u20132020 \n(cumulative USD-equivalent notional issuance)\n\nCumulative Asian Social Bond Issuance\n\nCumulative Asian Green Bond Issuance\n\nExcluding\nHigh Income\n6%\n\nIND\n2%\n\nPHI\n1%\n\nSIN\n0.06%\n\nPRC\n3%\n\nAUS\n4%\n\nKOR\n49%\n\nJPN\n41%\n\nTHA\n1%\n\nMAL\n1%\n\nPHI\n1%\n\nINO\n2%\n\nIND\n3%\n\nJPN\n13%\n\nPRC\n60%\n\nHigh Income\n94%\n\nExcluding\nHigh Income\n67%\n\nHigh Income\n33%\n\nKOR\n6%\n\nAUS\n6%\n\nHKG\n4%\n\nSIN\n2%\n\nTAP\n2%\n\nNZL\n2%\n\nAUS = Australia; ICMA = International Capital Market Association; IND = India; INO = Indonesia; JPN = Japan; KOR = Republic of Korea; MAL = Malaysia;  \nNZL = New Zealand; PHI = Philippines; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China; SIN = Singapore; TAP = Taipei,China; THA = Thailand; USD = United States dollar. \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations based on Bloomberg data.\n\n\f40\u2003Asia Bond Monitor March 2021\n\nleadership, and an enabling regulatory framework; they \ncan also take an active role in crowding in private capital \nby offering first-loss capital or capital guarantees. \n\nIt seems likely that neither investors\u2019 nor issuers\u2019 \nattraction to social bonds will fade with COVID-19. \nObstacles to market growth, however, include the lack of \na standardized set of metrics to measure impact, which \nleads to concerns about \u201csocial washing\u201d (i.e., overstating \nthe social value of a bond); a need for higher issuance \nvolume and diversity (i.e., more corporate issuers); a lack \nof training among financial advisers; and the lack of a \nsocial bond framework\u2014which can take time, money, and \nmanpower to develop\u2014for many of Asia\u2019s sovereigns and \ncorporates that would like to tap the market. \n\nThere is undoubtedly an urgent and compelling case for \nthe development of a robust social bond market in Asia. \nHarnessing the power of private capital to meet critical \nsocial needs is an opportunity for both issuers and \ninvestors to address these needs in a financial context. \nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic will eventually recede, \none lasting impact may well be its catalytic effect on \nthe development of social bonds worldwide. 2020 was \nthe year when mainstream investors \u201cdiscovered\u201d social \ninvestments; this presents an opportunity for investors \nto expand their commitment to this area and advance \nthe possibilities of what social investing can deliver \nin terms of real-world outcomes over a broad range \nof\u00a0issues.\n\nA Nascent Opportunity  \nfor ESG Investing\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has amplified inequality.12 \nThe crisis may push 71 million more people into extreme \npoverty. Highlighting the importance of social issues, \nthe pandemic has created sizable new investment \nopportunities as social theme becomes increasingly \nimportant for investors. In North America, the social \npillar outperformed the environmental and governance \npillars in the first quarter of 2020. Furthermore, \nAsian and European institutional investors are paying \nmore attention to the social pillar in their investment \nstrategy\u00a0(Figure 21).\n\nFigure 21: Importance of Environmental, Social, and \nGovernance for Institutional Investors\n\n3.4\n\n3.2\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n3.2 3.1\n\n4.0\n\n3.3\n\n4.8\n\n5.0\n\n4.3\n\n4.0\n\nl\n\ne\nc\nn\na\nv\ne\ne\nR\nG\nS\nE\n\n \n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nPrior to crisis\n\nPost crisis\n\nPrior to crisis\n\nPost crisis\n\nNorth America\n\nEurope and Asia\n\nYear of Issuance\n\nEnvironmental\n\nSocial\n\nGovernance\n\nESG = environmental, social, and governance.\nNote: ESG relevance is measured on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being the least \nrelevant and 5 the most relevant.\nSource: Greenwich Associates Coronavirus Flash Study, May 2020. \n\nSocial bond markets grow rapidly since COVID-19 \noutbreak. Social bonds account for approximately 15% \nof the USD1,366 billion in cumulative sustainable fixed-\nincome issuance. Europe is the dominant social bond \nissuer, accounting for 45% of new social bond issuance \nin 2020. However, issuance in Asia and the Pacific and \nNorth America is on the rise with the Asian market \nexperiencing the most rapid growth.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why institutional investors \nare showing greater interest in social bonds. First, \ninvesting in social bonds does not sacrifice returns. The \nrisk-return profile of social bonds is comparable to vanilla \nbonds from the same issuer. \n\nImportantly, social bonds provide a platform for engaged \ndialogue with corporate issuers. Such active ownership \nenables investors to encourage issuers to prioritize long-\nterm sustainability in their business operations. \n\nFurthermore, institutional investors can request issuers \nto report about the social outcomes of the investment \nprojects. This gives investors clearer information about \nthe measurable social impact of their investments while \nreducing the risk of social impact washing.\n\n12\u2002 This section is based on Social Bonds: A Nascent Opportunity for ESG Investing written by Elodie Laugel (Chief Responsible Investment Officer) and Isabelle Vic-Philippe (Head of \n\nEuro Aggregate) of Amundi.\n\n\fSocial Bonds\u2014Recent Developments and Trends\u200341\n\nFigure 22: Changing Composition of Social Bond Target \nProject Allocations, 2017\u20132019 vs. 2020 (share of  \nUSD-equivalent notional issuance, estimated)\n\n%\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nTo sum up, the pronounced impact of COVID-19 on the \npoor has exacerbated inequality. However, one positive \nconsequence has been the accelerated growth of social \nbonds, which can generate positive social outcomes. \nGoing forward, the growth of social bond markets is likely \nto be sustainable because they offer substantial benefits \nfor investors. The prospects for further expansion are \nespecially promising in Asia, where the markets remain \nrelatively small despite rapid recent growth.\n\nPromoting Social Bonds for  \nImpact Investments in Asia\n\nWith the volume of global social bond issuance having \nachieved a new record in 2020, it becomes critically \nimportant to understand how to optimize use of these \nfinancial instruments, specifically in terms of which social \nissues to address and which project types to target to \nmaximize deep and lasting impact.13 It is crucial that Asia \ngets this right so that social bonds are used to \u201cbuild back \nbetter\u201d and not for minimally impactful projects or, worse, \nfor social washing.\n\nAs the prefix \u201cpan\u201d indicates, the COVID-19 pandemic is \nmuch more than a health crisis; indeed, it affects virtually \nall aspects of human development. It has magnified the \npernicious effects of poverty and inequality, and led to \nmuch greater suffering among vulnerable communities as \ncompared to the better-off. Recovery work can thus be \nviewed as double-pronged: (i) meeting urgent short-term \nneeds such as employment generation, support for small \nbusiness, and healthcare provision; and (ii) launching \nlonger-term public works programs to reduce poverty and \ndevelop resilience to future shocks. \n\nAlong with a more than sevenfold y-o-y increase in social \nbond issuance in 2020, there has also been a significant \nchange in the pattern of target areas for social bond use \nof proceeds. Most notably, there was a shift from the pre-\n2020 focus on affordable housing to more pandemic-\nrelated project categories such as education and training \n(especially retraining for unemployed workers), and crisis \nalleviation efforts (a new category in the 2020 Social \nBond Principles that is primarily related to employment \ngeneration).

The pandemic has exposed the \nvast\u00a0weaknesses, inequities, and shortages associated  \nwith healthcare in many developing economies; surely,  \na build-back-better approach must be founded on a \nresilient and equitable healthcare system to prevent \nand\u00a0mitigate future crises.\n\nCOVID-19 has also exposed critical vulnerabilities in global \nfood and water systems by straining supplies, disrupting \nfood chains, and increasing food insecurity for millions of \npeople.

This is a wake-up call alerting the world to \nthe potential for improved water and nutritional systems \nin the developing world to fundamentally improve global \nhealth outcomes for everyone. \n\nProviding support to SMEs is a short-term necessity \nto get both businesses and people back on their feet \nagain after the demand shock of the pandemic and \nlockdown policies. SMEs account for more than 96% \nof all businesses in Asia and the Pacific, and more than \ntwo-thirds of the private sector workforce. Even before \nthe pandemic, SMEs faced a number of critical obstacles, \nmost importantly their lack of access to finance. We \nestimate that 100% of Asian social bond issuance \n(excluding issuers in high-income economies) in 2020 \nwas allocated to SME financing, which is not surprising \ngiven the nature of the shock and economic structure of \nthe region (Figure 23).\n\nWhile it is imperative to raise funds to meet the short- to \nmedium-term needs of people and businesses in the \nwake of the pandemic, it is just as imperative to address \nthe need for greater levels of resilience in advance of the \nnext crisis\u2014and, even better, to prevent the next crisis. \nMuch of developing Asia is considered to be lacking \nin the area of resilience. The UN Economic and Social \nCommission for Asia and the Pacific estimates that \nover 60% of the population of Asia and the Pacific lacks \naccess to social protection, as do 70% of workers in the \nregion\u2019s informal sector. Poverty increases vulnerability to \nshocks in a number of ways, as the pandemic has amply \ndemonstrated.\n\nPerhaps the greatest opportunity for impactful \ninvestment is education, especially girls\u2019 education. This is \nnot only a basic human right, but it is also one of the most \neffective ways to drive sustainable development, improve \nhealth, reduce conflict, and save lives. Even before the \npandemic, girls\u2019 access to education was limited in a \nnumber of Asian economies. The pandemic has made a \ndifficult situation much worse, as girls who were forced \nout of school by the pandemic are much less likely than \nboys to return to their studies. If this trend is not reversed, \nit could have repercussions for many years to come. This, \nin turn, highlights the pressing need for innovative finance \nto advance gender equity, as the pandemic has had a \ndramatically gender-differentiated impact throughout \nAsia and the Pacific. \n\nFigure 23: Social Bond Issuance Allocation to SME \nFinance by Region and Income Level, 2020 (share of \nUSD-equivalent notional, estimated) \n\n100% 100%\n\n%\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n39%\n\n33%\n\n4%\n\n0%\n\nEurope\n\nAsia-\nPaci\ufb01c\n\nSouth\nAsia\n\nLatin\nAmerica\n\nAsia-\nPaci\ufb01c\n\nLatin\nAmerica\n\nEurope\n\nNorth\nAmerica\n\nExcluding High Income\n\nHigh Income\n\n6%\n\n6%\n\n3%\n\nSupra-\nnational\n\nSMEs = small and medium-sized enterprises, USD = United States dollar.\nSources: Authors\u2019 calculations based on review of Bloomberg data, issuer social \nbond frameworks, and reviewer second opinions.\n\nPoverty and inequality underpin many of the \nabovementioned social ills and present unique \nintersectional dimensions. While poverty has declined \nsubstantially in Asia and the Pacific over the past several \ndecades, its rate of reduction has slowed since 2010, \nand the pandemic is certain to reverse a number of \nthose gains. Social ills are deeply and fundamentally \nintersectional; many problems bleed into and are \nconnected to others, so solving these problems demands \nan intersectional approach.\n\nThe knotty and unresolved question of social impact \nmeasurement is central to the theme of building back \nbetter. Social bonds are only as good as the impact \nthey help to achieve, so it is imperative that they and \nall other ESG-linked instruments are assessed by as \nrigorous a method of social impact measurement as is \npracticable. But practicability in this area is a serious \nconstraint and thus it is not surprising that social impact \nmeasurement is by no means a settled issue. There is \nmuch experimentation and innovation going on in the \nfield, much of it useful and instructional, but there is as \nyet no widespread coalescence around a single model of \nsocial impact assessment. \n\nTo promote more standardized impact measurement, \nan ICMA working group has released a draft version of \nrecommendations for social bond issuers. In particular, it \n\n\fSocial Bonds\u2014Recent Developments and Trends\u200343\n\nproposes standardized reporting based on ICMA project \ncategories and subcategories, project allocation share, \ntarget population, project lifetime, and measurements \nbased on the output, outcomes, and/or impact of \nprojects; but it does not propose a definitive list of such \nimpact measurements. \n\nSome discomfort around this is appropriate, as social \nimpact measurement is to some extent an exercise \nin quantifying the unquantifiable. None of this, \nhowever, lessens the importance and value of impact \nmeasurement. \n\nIt will be challenging for policymakers, issuers, and \ninvestors to determine which issue areas should be \naddressed through social bond financing. Without \nstandardized impact measurement methodologies, \nmarket participants\u2019 ability to compare projects is limited; \nand with so many high-priority needs, hard decisions \nwill be necessary. The good news is that social bonds \nhave proven themselves to be valuable instruments \nfor directing private capital to these myriad priorities, \nwhile impact measurement is improving and deepening \nthroughout the industry. From resilience to SME support, \nfrom gender equity to healthcare, social bonds will \nbe an essential tool for financing the work needed for \ndeveloping Asia to build back better.\n\n\f44\u2003Asia Bond Monitor March 2021\n\nAsianBondsOnline 2020  \nBond Market Liquidity Survey\n\nIntroduction\n\nLiquidity is an integral aspect of bond markets. Good \nmarket liquidity is a key advantage for investors, as it \nkeeps funds from being locked up and allows investors to \nquickly liquidate bonds when needed. For issuers, good \nliquidity allows them to issue bonds with longer maturities \nto mitigate prepayment risk. Hence, a key aspect in \nthe development of a well-functioning bond market \nis to ensure both breadth and depth in bond market \ntransactions, as well as doing so at a low transaction cost. \nIf there is a lack of liquidity in bond markets, issuance \nfrom corporates and governments, and readiness to invest \nfrom investors, will be curtailed.\n\nAs part of AsianBondsOnline\u2019s efforts to provide \ninformation on local currency (LCY) bond markets, a \nbond market liquidity survey is conducted on an annual \nbasis. The goal of the survey is to provide a snapshot \nof the state of liquidity in emerging East Asian bond \nmarkets.14 The survey helps identify areas of weakness \nin each of the region\u2019s bond markets that could aid key \nbond market stakeholders, particularly policy makers \nand financial market regulators, to undertake reforms \nand/or address areas for development. For the 2020 \nsurvey, a shortened version compared to past surveys \nwas conducted. The survey was undertaken solely via \nemail as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak \nrestricted us from conducting market visits and face-to-\nface interviews. \n\nAs in past years, the survey was targeted for various bond \nmarket participants such as bond traders from financial \ninstitutions, financial market brokers, research houses, \nfund managers, and bond pricing agencies. The survey \nperiod commenced from late November through the \nmiddle of December 2020, with the aim of capturing the \nimpact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the region\u2019s bond \nmarkets. \n\nThe survey comprises two parts: a quantitative section \nand a qualitive section, each covering LCY government \n\nand corporate bonds. The quantitative section analyzes \nmarket data on bid\u2013ask spreads and transaction sizes, \nwhich are used as measures for assessing the liquidity \nconditions in each of the region\u2019s LCY bond markets. \nThe qualitative section presents the overall perception of \nmarket participants on the degree of development of their \nrespective bond market based on identified structural \nissues.\n\nBoth advanced and emerging economies were roiled \nby the COVID-19 pandemic. Government efforts to \nmitigate the spread of the disease, such as lockdowns \nand quarantines, as well as reduced consumer demand, \nled to a contraction in economic output in 2020. \nFinancial markets were also affected, with some markets \nexperiencing a decline in liquidity and heightened \nbankruptcy risks. This led to central governments and \ncentral banks in the region engaging in measures to help \nsupport the economy and boost liquidity in financial \nmarkets. Central banks also implemented accommodative \nmonetary policy measures.\n\nIn some markets, liquidity and overall trading activity \ndeclined as a result of the negative sentiment and impact \nof COVID-19. An increase in government bonds as \na result of fiscal stimulus measures also helped drain \nliquidity. But in other cases, positive investor sentiment \nfor that particular economy and/or the accommodative \nmeasures of central banks helped boost liquidity.\n\nThe majority of survey participants noted that overall \nbond market liquidity in emerging East Asia increased \nduring 2020. Some 53% of participants said that overall \nbond market liquidity improved versus 2019, while 38% \nsaid that liquidity had worsened (Figure 24). Only 9% said \nthat liquidity remained the same.\n\nHowever, on a per market basis, liquidity conditions were \ndeemed mixed in 2020. Most survey participants from the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Indonesia, Malaysia, \nand Viet Nam observed improved conditions over the \nprevious year. On the other hand, participants from \n\n14\u2002 Emerging East Asia comprises the People\u2019s Republic of China; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; the Philippines; Singapore; Thailand; and Viet Nam.\n\n\fAsianBondsOnline 2020 Bond Market Liquidity Survey\u200345\n\nQuantitative Indicators  \nfor Government Bond Markets\n\nFigure 26 presents the quarterly turnover ratios for \nemerging East Asian markets where data are available. \nA similar pattern in nearly all markets were noted where \nthe quarterly turnover ratio was the highest in the \nfirst quarter (Q1) of 2020 before exhibiting a decline. \nTurnover ratios in the region\u2019s government bond markets \nwere mostly down in the second quarter (Q2) of 2020 \nas markets experienced the full impact of quarantine \nmeasures, affecting both investor sentiment and drying \nup liquidity due to the curtailment of economic activities. \nThe exceptions were the PRC and Singapore, which \nboth saw increases in their respective government bond \nturnover ratios in Q2 2020. The PRC was one of the few \nmarkets that showed an economic recovery in 2020, \nwhich had a positive impact on investor sentiment. Also, \nnotable is that nearly all markets posted steady declines in \ngovernment turnover ratios from Q2 2020 to the fourth \nquarter (Q4) of 2020, except for Indonesia and Malaysia. \nIn Indonesia, declining interest rates and renewed foreign \ninvestor interest helped boost liquidity. In Malaysia, the \n\nFigure 26: Local Currency Government Bond Turnover \nRatios\n\nFigure 24: Liquidity Conditions in 2020 vs. 2019\n\nNo Change\n9% \n\nDecreased\n38%\n\nNote: Figures refer to percentage of survey respondents.\nSource: AsianBondsOnline 2020 Local Currency Bond Market Liquidity Survey.\n\nIncreased\n53%\n\nthe Republic of Korea, the Philippines, Singapore, and \nThailand noted decreased liquidity. Survey respondents \nfrom Hong Kong, China perceived that there was no \nchange in liquidity conditions in 2020 versus 2019. \n\nMarket participants were also asked about various factors \nthat affected liquidity conditions in the bond market in \n2020. The three biggest drivers of liquidity were market \nsentiment, the COVID-19 pandemic, and movements \nin bond yields (Figure 25). It was also observed that \namong various factors, developments relating to the euro \narea had the least impact on emerging East Asia\u2019s bond \nmarkets. Factors relating to Brexit and the euro area\u2019s \neconomy and monetary policy were only mentioned by a \nhandful of participants.\n\nFigure 25: Factors Affecting Bond Market Liquidity  \nin 2020\n\nMarket sentiment\nGlobal COVID-19 pandemic\nChange in domestic bond yields\nDomestic COVID-19 cases\nAsset price movements in global markets\nLocal quarantine measures\nUS monetary policy\nUS economy\nEuro area monetary policy\nBrexit\nEuro area economy\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n28\n\n28\n\n27\n\n20\n\n19\n\n18\n\n17\n\n12\n\nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, US = United States.\nNote: Figures refer to the count of responses for each identified factor.\nSource: AsianBondsOnline 2020 Local Currency Bond Market Liquidity Survey.\n\n%\n1.2\n\n0.9\n\n0.6\n\n0.3\n\n0.0\n\nHKG\n\nINO\n\nKOR\n\nMAL\n\nPRC\n\nSIN\n\nTHA\n\nQ4 2020\n\nQ3 2020\n\nQ2 2020\n\nQ1 2020\n\nQ4 2019\n\nHKG = Hong Kong, China; INO = Indonesia; KOR = Republic of Korea;  \nMAL = Malaysia; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China; Q1 = first quarter,  \nQ2 = second quarter; Q3 = third quarter; Q4 = fourth quarter; SIN = Singapore; \nTHA = Thailand.\nNotes:\n1.

A lower bid\u2013ask spread indicates a more liquid \nmarket. The regional average bid\u2013ask spread for on-the-\nrun government bonds for the 2020 survey stood at \n2.8\u00a0basis points (bps), which was unchanged from the \n2019 survey (Figure 27).\n\nThe lowest government bond bid\u2013ask spreads were \nfound in the PRC and the Republic of Korea with bid\u2013ask \nspreads of less than 1 bp each. The PRC has benefitted \nfrom continued development of its bond market as well \nas strong inflows from foreign investors. The Republic \nof Korea, on the other hand, is considered a safe haven \namong its emerging East Asian peers.\n\nBid\u2013ask spreads narrowed in 2020 in four emerging \nEast Asian markets: the PRC, Indonesia, Thailand, and \nViet Nam. Bid\u2013ask spreads in Viet Nam improved the \nmost, falling to 4.5 bps in the 2020 survey from 5.5 bps \nin 2019, owing to strong domestic demand. The PRC\u2019s \nbid\u2013ask spread also fell from 1.1 bps to 0.6 bps in the same \nperiod. The PRC and Viet Nam were the two markets in \n\nthe region that successfully contained their COVID-19 \noutbreak early on, boosting investor sentiment in their \nrespective markets. In contrast, Malaysia\u2019s bid\u2013ask \nspreads worsened the most, rising to 4.0 bps in 2020 \nfrom 2.7 bps in 2019. The bid\u2013ask spreads for all other \nemerging East Asian markets were marginally changed \nwith either an increase or decrease of 0.3 bps or less. \n\nBid\u2013ask spreads for off-the-run government bonds \ndeclined for the region as a whole, averaging 5.0 bps in the \n2020 survey versus 5.5 bps in the 2019 survey (Figure\u00a028).\n\nFigure 29 presents the average transaction size for \non-the-run government bonds in emerging East Asia. \nChanges in transaction sizes were mixed in the region. \nLarge declines were noted in the PRC; Hong Kong, China; \nand Singapore; and to a lesser extent in the Philippines, \nwhile increases were seen in Malaysia and Indonesia. \nBased on the 2020 survey results, the Republic of Korea \nhad the largest average transaction size at USD9.2 million \nper trade.

Some participants cited limited ways of \nhedging government bond risk. For example, in Viet Nam, \ngovernment bond futures were only launched in 2019, \nwhile in Indonesia, they were first offered in 2017. The \nPhilippines currently lacks a bond futures market.

Five \nout of nine emerging East Asian corporate bond markets \nsaw a widening of bid-ask spreads as the pandemic \noutbreak highlighted bankruptcy concerns amid declines \nin economic output. Singapore had the largest widening \nof its corporate bid\u2013ask spread, which rose to 52.5 bps \nfrom 10.8 bps (Figure 32). The PRC\u2019s bid\u2013ask spread rose \nto 11.3 bps from 4.0 bps.
