The region\u2019s economy is already similar in size to \nthose of Europe and North America, and its influence in \nthe world continues to increase. In many Asian countries, \nthe cycle of poverty has been broken; in others, this \nhistoric aim is within sight. Asia\u2019s extraordinary success has brought \nnew challenges\u2014while rapid economic growth remains a priority, \ncitizens demand that it also be sustainable and more inclusive. And \nAsia is now so important to the world economy that it must also \nplay a larger role in global economic leadership. Regional economic \ncooperation is essential for addressing these challenges.\n  Asia\u2019s economic rise is unprecedented. The region is home to \nover half the world\u2019s population, produces three tenths of global \noutput (in terms of purchasing power), and consistently records the \nworld\u2019s highest economic growth rates. The Asian \u201cmiracle\u201d (World \nBank 1993) did not end with the 1997/98 financial crisis a decade ago; \nfor some countries, it marked the beginning of renewed acceleration. \nThe question is no longer whether Asia will be central to the 21st \ncentury economy, but rather how it will exercise its prominent role \nand how its dependence on the rest of the world has decreased. \n  Regionalism is a relatively new aspect of Asia\u2019s rise.1 Asia\u2019s \neconomies  are  increasingly  connected  through  trade,  financial \ntransactions, direct investment, technology, labor and tourist flows, \nand other economic relationships. This study focuses on 16 Asian \neconomies that are already, in some respects, as closely intertwined \nas Europe\u2019s single market. This \u201cIntegrating Asia\u201d (see definitions \nin the appendix to this chapter) accounts for 87% of the region\u2019s \npopulation and 96% of its output (Table 1.1)\u2014hence, it is often \n1  \u201cRegionalism\u201d and related terms used in this study are defined in the Glossary.\n10", "Why Asian Regionalism?\nreferred to simply as Asia2\u2014and conducts more than half of its trade \nwith itself. It includes some of the world\u2019s wealthiest economies and \nsome of its poorest, large continental powers as well as small city-\nstates, continuously independent countries and former colonies. Its \nstrength derives from the openness, diversity, and dynamism of its \ninterconnected economies. \n  Asian economies are principally connected through markets\u2014\nbut where markets lead, governments are following. Asian leaders \nhave committed to work together more closely and have already \ntaken concrete steps in some areas. The 1997/98 financial crisis, in \nparticular, was an important catalyst for this new regionalism and gave \nrise to a range of new initiatives. These have not sought to replicate \nthe institutions of the European Union (EU), but have rather focused \non finding new and flexible forms of cooperation that reflect the \nregion\u2019s diversity and pragmatism. Nor are Asia\u2019s regional initiatives \nintended to replace global relationships, but rather to complement \nthem. It is not a matter of pulling up the drawbridge, but of building \nbridges that connect Asian economies together as well as to the rest \nof the world. \n  The stakes could not be higher. A dynamic and outward-looking \nAsian regionalism could bring huge benefits not just to Asia, but to \nthe world. It could help sustain the region\u2019s growth, underpin its \nstability, and\u2014with the right policies\u2014reduce inequality. And it could \nhelp marshal a common response to major new challenges that often \narise suddenly and unexpectedly. As this study goes to press, for \ninstance, Asia is grappling with the wrenching economic and financial \nuncertainty sparked by the global credit crunch since August 2007, \nseveral devastating natural disasters, and the pressing need to ensure \naffordable food supplies throughout Asia. A vibrant, integrated Asia \ncould bring the region\u2019s immense intellectual and economic resources \nto bear on these and tomorrow\u2019s challenges. And it could help \npower and stabilize the global economy by boosting productivity, \nraising living standards, and reducing poverty everywhere. A stable, \ncohesive, and productive Asia is thus in everyone\u2019s interest.\n  This study draws on the 42 years of experience of the Asian \n2  East Asian economies dominate the list of Integrating Asia because of their long-\nstanding commitment to outward-oriented development. Their regional links are \ndeeper than those of South, West, or Central Asia. However, this is changing. India \nhas substantially realigned its policies toward integration with global and Asian \nmarkets, and other Asian countries are also following suit.\n11", "Emerging Asian Regionalism\nTable 1.1.

The report examines the \ndrivers of integration, explores options for cooperation, and develops \nrealistic strategies for building a dynamic and open Asian economic \ncommunity. It thus provides insight on the great issues that will help \nto shape Asia\u2019s future.\nHow regionalism can benefit Asia\nRegional cooperation, effectively structured and implemented, is a \npowerful new tool in Asia\u2019s policy arsenal. It can help Asia address \nregional challenges as well as provide stronger foundations for its \nglobal role. An integrated Asia can\n  \u2022  link the competitive strengths of its diverse economies in \norder to boost their productivity and sustain the region\u2019s \nexceptional growth;\n  \u2022  connect  the  region\u2019s  capital  markets  to  enhance  financial \nstability, reduce the cost of capital, and improve opportunities \nfor sharing risks; \n  \u2022  cooperate  in  setting  exchange  rate  and  macroeconomic \npolicies in order to minimize the effects of global and regional \nshocks and to facilitate the resolution of global imbalances; \n  \u2022  pool the region\u2019s foreign exchange reserves to make more \nresources available for investment and development;\n  \u2022  exercise leadership in global decision making to sustain the \nopen global trade and financial systems that have supported a \nhalf century of unparalleled economic development;\n  \u2022  build connected infrastructure and collaborate on inclusive \ndevelopment  to  reduce  inequalities  within  and  across \neconomies and thus to strengthen support for pro-growth \npolicies; and\n  \u2022  create regional mechanisms to manage cross-border health, \nsafety, and environmental issues better. \n  The opportunities are clear, which is why regional integration \ndeserves a high priority in national policy making. Yet the challenge \nof cooperation should not be underestimated; it will require trust, \ninnovation, and compromise\u2014and, most likely, time. Policy makers \nat the highest levels appear committed to pushing the regional \nagenda forward, but considerable leadership and energy are needed \nto achieve results. \n13", "Emerging Asian Regionalism\n  These benefits from cooperation could extend also to developing \nAsian economies that are not yet part of the region\u2019s integrating \ncore. Indeed, in relative terms, newcomers to regional integration \nhave the most to gain from the expanded opportunities for economic \ndevelopment that it provides. Hence, an important aim of this study \nis to make the case for integration to countries that have not yet \nadopted an outward-oriented development strategy and to provide \nguidance on how to build stronger regional connections.\nHow Asian regionalism can benefit the world\nThe  rest  of  the  world  could  benefit,  too.  So  long  as  Asia\u2019s \neconomies  continue  to  integrate  not  just  with  each  other,  but \nalso  with  the  rest  of  the  world,  sustained  Asian  dynamism, \nstrengthened  by  regional  cooperation,  could  bolster  Asia\u2019s \nrole  as  a  new  and  stabilizing  engine  of  global  economic \ngrowth.  There  are  many  reasons  why  Asia  is  likely  to  remain  \noutward-looking\u2014not least because its economy is in large part built \non economies of scale and scope in manufacturing and so requires \nglobal  markets  to  perform  at  its  potential.  Indeed,  because  an \nintegrated Asia will continue to have a powerful stake in the global \neconomy, it would have both an incentive and the leverage to play a \nbigger role in keeping global markets open and vibrant. An integrated \nAsia can\n  \u2022  generate productivity gains, new ideas, and competition that \nboost economic growth and raise incomes across the world;\n  \u2022  contribute to the efficiency and stability of global financial \nmarkets by making Asian capital markets stronger and safer, \nand by maximizing the productive use of Asian savings;\n  \u2022  diversify  sources  of  global  demand,  helping  to  stabilize \nthe world economy and diminish the risks posed by global \nimbalances and downturns in other major economies;\n  \u2022  provide leadership to help sustain open global trade and \nfinancial systems; and \n  \u2022  create regional mechanisms to manage health, safety, and \nenvironmental issues better, and thus contribute to more \neffective global solutions of these problems. \n  While Asian regionalism is primarily motivated by the desire \nto advance welfare in the region, it would not do so by detracting \nfrom development elsewhere. On the contrary, Asian regionalism can \nhelp to sustain global economic progress at a time when other major \nregions are reaching economic maturity.\n14", "Why Asian Regionalism?\n1.1.\t\tThe\teconomics\tof\tregionalism\nThe economics of regionalism have a complex and troubled history. In \nthe 1930s, countries created preferential trade blocs in an attempt to \nshelter their economies from the Great Depression. Several countries \nestablished  discriminatory  currency  blocs  with  strict  exchange \ncontrols against outsiders. Far from helping, these arrangements led to \nthe collapse of international trade and financial flows, accelerating the \ndownward spiral of economic activity. This experience was foremost \nin the mind of the architects of the post-war global economic system \nas they adopted the principle of nondiscrimination as a central pillar \nof the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the forerunner \nof the World Trade Organization (WTO). Many economists and policy \nmakers remain skeptical about regionalism because of its potentially \nnegative impact on the multilateral trade and financial system. \n  The case for regionalism therefore has to be carefully formulated. \nRegionalism must not lead to protectionist blocs\u2014a \u201cfortress Asia\u201d \nis no more desirable than a \u201cfortress Europe\u201d or a \u201cfortress North \nAmerica\u201d would be. But the open, outward-oriented regionalism that \nis emerging in Asia can avoid posing such a threat. Just as the absence \nof barriers to commerce within national economies\u2014that is, among \nthe states and provinces of countries such as the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC), India, Germany,3 and the United States (US)\u2014is generally \nbeneficial, so too is the creation of a market spanning several national \neconomies.4 Much of the evidence assembled in this report suggests \nthat Asia has\u2014and will continue to have\u2014a fundamental stake in \nboth regional and global integration.\n  The case for collective action arises from market failures that \nreduce economic welfare in the absence of official measures. The case \nfor regional cooperation is still more specific: it addresses problems \nthat are inherently regional in scope or, for other reasons, cannot \nbe solved at a global or national level. Rapid regional growth and \nintegration generate new commercial opportunities and demands \nfor governmental cooperation and institutional development. But \n3  The 1834 Zollverein, a customs union of the 18 small states that eventually \nformed Germany, is an early example of the elimination of barriers in territories \nthat later also formed a political union. \n4  The potential value of this approach is recognized in the multilateral trading \nsystem: Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) permits \nthe establishment of free trade areas, provided that they encompass \u201csubstantially \nall the trade between the constituent territories\u201d and do not increase the barriers \nfaced by excluded countries.\n15", "Emerging Asian Regionalism\nbecause  regional  action  could  introduce  new  distortions,  global \ncooperation is often preferable. In practice, though, reaching and \nimplementing  global  agreements  is  difficult,  and  international \nmarket failures that ideally ought to be addressed globally often are \nnot. Regional solutions can be better targeted and are often more \nachievable. Important priorities for regional collective action are as \nfollows:\n  \u2022\t Provide\tpublic\tgoods\tthat\tare\tunlikely\tto\tbe\tproduced\tby\t\nmarkets\tor\tindividual\teconomies. These include measures \nto  head  off  international  epidemics,  respond  to  natural \ndisasters, and develop and disseminate knowledge, including \ntechnological  and  scientific  findings  as  well  as  policy \nexperience in areas such as financial regulation, pensions, and \npoverty reduction. \n\t \u2022\t Manage\tthe\tspillover\teffects\tof\teconomic\tactivity\tand\tpolicy\t\namong\tconnected\teconomies.\tThese inevitably grow with \ndeeper economic integration. The regional contagion observed \nduring the 1997/98 financial crisis is an important example, \nas concerns about liquidity and financial management in one \ncountry led to runs, speculative attacks, and dislocation in \nothers. But routine macroeconomic changes\u2014such as interest \nrate  or  currency  movements\u2014can  also  have  significant \nimpacts. This calls for monitoring regional macroeconomic \nactivity as well as for policy dialogue. Cross-border effects \nmay also be significant in many other policy areas, notably the \nenvironment and migration. \n\t \u2022\t Coordinate\t regional\t policy\t approaches\t to\t projects\t or\t\ndecisions\tthat\taffect\tseveral\teconomies.\tSuch efforts can \nrange from the palpable need to cooperate on investments \nin  trade-oriented  transport,  communications,  and  policy \ninfrastructure  links  to  more  complex  initiatives,  such  as \nharmonizing  regional  approaches  in  international  forums. \nFor instance, the combined efforts of Asian economies could \nsignificantly enhance the prospects for a successful conclusion \nof WTO\u2019s Doha Round, an outcome that would benefit Asia and \nthe world at large. \n\t \u2022\t Liberalize\ttrade\tand\tinvestment beyond\tlevels\tachievable\t\nthrough\t global\t negotiations.  This  can  be  accomplished \nby establishing rules and institutions that enable countries \nto further integrate markets and by helping to harmonize \nstandards, regulations, and processes so that businesses can \noperate more effectively in different economies. \n16", "Why Asian Regionalism?\n\t \u2022\t Add\tvalue\tto\tnational\tpolicy\tmaking. Efforts can include \nsharing best practices and highlighting priorities that may run \ncounter to domestic special interests, such as measures to \nenhance competition and regulatory oversight, reduce poverty \nand inequality, and control environmental externalities.\n  The case for regionalism is neither automatic nor self-evident; \ngoodwill  among  countries  does  not  necessarily  make  for  good \neconomic  policy.  Regional  cooperation  may  be  less  desirable \nthan global cooperation, and it may even be worse than inaction. \nTheoretically, removing some barriers could reduce welfare rather \nthan increase it. Regional cooperation is therefore not a goal to be \npursued for its own sake; it is a means for achieving more fundamental \nobjectives. But, subject to these cautions, concerted regional action \nis a powerful\u2014and, in some cases, essential\u2014tool for promoting \nefficient regional economic development. \n1.2.\tThe\tchallenge\tof\tcooperation\nAsia\u2019s  growing  economic  interdependence  provides  many \nopportunities for cooperation. These are divided into four major \nareas in this study: (1) trade, investment, and the integration of \n\u201creal\u201d economic activity; (2) financial integration; (3) macroeconomic \npolicy links; and (4) shared social and environmental concerns. The \nstudy analyzes the progress of market-based integration in each of \nthese areas. It also explores opportunities for intergovernmental \ncooperation\u2014or, in economic terminology, identifies potential market \nfailures and coordination problems that are best addressed through \nregional collective action. It additionally examines the architecture of \narrangements that might enable such collaborations. The framework \nof this analysis is summarized in Table 1.2.\n  Despite  the  compelling  case  for  cooperation,  marshaling \ngovernments\u2019 efforts across this vast, diverse region is a daunting \nchallenge. The examples of the EU and, to a lesser extent, the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) highlight some of \nthe difficulties involved. But Asia is not Europe or North America; \nits  economy,  history,  and  politics  are  different.  Some  types  of \nintegration\u2014for example, trade\u2014are deeper in Asia today than they \nwere in Europe in the early stages of European regionalism in the \n1950s and 1960s.

Cooperation is therefore likely \nto evolve gradually, with different groups of countries progressing \nat varying speeds, using several frameworks and forums to address \nsubsets of policy interests. Such a multitrack, multispeed approach is \nlikely to offer the most efficient framework for cooperation in Asia.\n  Asia\u2019s approach to regionalism is likely to have other distinct \ncharacteristics as well. The region\u2019s policy-making style is typically \npragmatic and cautious. Cooperation is primarily aimed at making \nmarkets work better and tends to be limited to specific initiatives \nand objectives. Although intergovernmental dialogue at all levels \nhas greatly increased, formal regional institutions remain relatively \nunderdeveloped. These are likely to gain traction only insofar as \nthey promise and, eventually, deliver tangible benefits\u2014not just to \nelite groups, but to the population as a whole. The public appears to \nhave positive expectations of regionalism. A study conducted for this \nreport, based on a region-wide survey of opinion leaders, indicates \nthat Asians generally see regional integration as beneficial, a strategy \nfor enhancing the welfare of participating countries while leaving \nothers no worse off.

But building an Asian economic community \nis a long-term undertaking, and the economic climate cannot be \nexpected to remain consistently favorable. \n  Some risks are known. Global demand and financial stability \nare important to Asia and could be compromised by a deepening \ncredit crisis; a falling dollar; a sudden unwinding of current account \nimbalances; and/or rapidly rising energy, food, and other commodity \nprices. Other shocks, including adverse effects of global warming, \ncould become more severe over time. In Asia as well, after a long \nperiod of economic expansion (in some countries stretching back \nnearly two decades), there are bound to be financial reversals and \neconomic slowdowns due to business cycles whether they originate \nin the region or elsewhere, and to longer term challenges such as \nexcess  savings  and  population  ageing.  New  health  or  security \nthreats could make the flow of people and goods more difficult and \nexpensive. Environmental damage could result in radical changes \nin economic policies. Social instability could generate tensions and \nuncertainty that overwhelm economic progress. Many of these risks \ncan be diminished with adequate foresight and cooperation, and some \nstrategies for doing so are addressed by this study. But not all risks \ncan be known, and the unexpected often has the greatest impact. \n  Unanticipated developments could set Asian regionalism back\u2014\nor  accelerate  it.  The  1997/98  financial  crisis  stimulated  greater \nregional cooperation and a greater commitment to integration. Asian \ngovernments now realize more clearly that they face a wide range of \ncommon challenges\u2014such as financial contagion as well as deadly \ndiseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian \nflu\u2014and have much to gain from addressing them jointly. \n  In some respects, regional cooperation is a form of insurance. \nPotential problem areas can be monitored, for instance, through \nAsia\u2019s  new  mechanisms  for  macroeconomic  policy  surveillance. \nCoordinated policy responses can head off problems or at least \nminimize  their  impact.  Cooperative  mechanisms  can  even  limit \nthe impact of risks that cannot be identified in advance. The dense \nnetwork  of  consultative  arrangements  that  Asia  is  building  can \nprovide an early warning system and rapid response mechanism for \nemerging threats. \n22", "Why Asian Regionalism?\n1.3.\t\tPlan\tof\tthe\tstudy\t\nThis study examines the economic rationale for Asian regionalism, \nwith a focus on trade, financial, macroeconomic, social, and related \nissues such as the environment and population ageing. It assembles \nevidence  on  deepening  ties  among  Asian  economies  and  offers \noptions for regional policy, including the architecture of regional \ncooperation. These are challenging tasks, in part because the ties \nthat  bind  the  region  together  are  complex  and  interdependent. \nRegional cooperation must be viewed as a comprehensive strategy \nfor achieving wide economic and social goals. The time horizon of the \nstudy is 2020, but it will be also necessary to look further ahead to set \nthe context for the region\u2019s policy in the longer term. \n  Chapter 2 provides an overview of Asian regional integration and \nopportunities for regional cooperation. The subsequent four chapters \naddress  the  functional  channels  that  connect  Asian  economies: \ntrade and investment (Chapter 3), financial markets (Chapter 4), \nmacroeconomic policies (Chapter 5), and social and environmental \nissues (Chapter 6). These threads are brought together in an analysis \nof the architecture of regional cooperation (Chapter 7). The concluding \nchapter (Chapter 8) considers the implications of the study for the \nway ahead.\n23", "Emerging Asian Regionalism\nChapter 1:\tappendix\nIntegrating\tAsia:\ta\tdefinition\nHow  far  might  an  Asian  economic  community  extend?  Asia\u2019s \ngeographical boundaries are not generally agreed, and geography \nalone will not determine the locus of regional cooperation. Rather, the \nshape of \u201cIntegrating Asia\u201d will be determined by the economic and \npolitical ties that connect its members and by the commitment that \nits governments make to cooperation. This study does not prejudge \nthose patterns, although Chapter 7 provides an overview of some of \nthe options. Cooperation is likely to remain fluid for some time, with \ndifferent groups of countries using different structures to address \nshared interests. \n  This study focuses on a group of 16 economies that represent \nIntegrating Asia in the sense that they already have substantial regional \neconomic ties. The group includes the 10 members of the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)\u2014Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, \nLao People's Democratic Republic, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, \nPhilippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam\u2014as well as People's \nRepublic of China; Hong Kong, China; India; Japan; the  Republic of \nKorea; and Taipei,China. \n  This group is somewhat arbitrary. Some scholars might argue that \nit should include other West and South Asian economies, even though \ntheir primary economic connections are so far with other regions. A \ncase could also be made for including countries in Central Asia that \nare developing subregional ties but are still only loosely integrated \nwith the region as a whole. Some might also wish to include Australia, \nNew Zealand, and the Pacific, because their economic ties to the \nregion are very strong, even though they lie some distance from the \nAsian landmass. Indeed, all of these countries participate in one or \nmore cooperative arrangements involving Asian economies. \n24"], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20080618154535+08'00'", "Creator": "Adobe InDesign CS2 (4.0)", "Producer": "Adobe PDF Library 7.0", "ModDate": "D:20080618154540+08'00'", "Trapped": "False"}}
