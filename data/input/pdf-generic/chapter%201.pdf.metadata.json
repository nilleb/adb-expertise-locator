The region\u2019s economy is already similar in size to \nthose of Europe and North America, and its influence in \nthe world continues to increase. In many Asian countries, \nthe  cycle  of  poverty  has  been  broken;  in  others,  this \nhistoric aim is within sight. Asia\u2019s extraordinary success has brought \nnew  challenges\u2014while  rapid  economic  growth  remains  a  priority, \ncitizens demand that it also be sustainable and more inclusive. And \nAsia  is  now  so  important  to  the  world  economy  that  it  must  also \nplay a larger role in global economic leadership. Regional economic \ncooperation is essential for addressing these challenges.\n \nAsia\u2019s  economic  rise  is  unprecedented.  The  region  is  home  to \nover  half  the  world\u2019s  population,  produces  three  tenths  of  global \noutput (in terms of purchasing power), and consistently records the \nworld\u2019s highest economic growth rates. The Asian \u201cmiracle\u201d (World \nBank 1993) did not end with the 1997/98 financial crisis a decade ago; \nfor some countries, it marked the beginning of renewed acceleration. \nThe  question  is  no  longer  whether  Asia  will  be  central  to  the  21st \ncentury economy, but rather how it will exercise its prominent role \nand how its dependence on the rest of the world has decreased. \nRegionalism  is  a  relatively  new  aspect  of  Asia\u2019s  rise.1  Asia\u2019s \n \neconomies  are  increasingly  connected  through  trade,  financial \ntransactions, direct investment, technology, labor and tourist flows, \nand  other  economic  relationships.  This  study  focuses  on  16  Asian \neconomies that are already, in some respects, as closely intertwined \nas  Europe\u2019s  single  market.  This  \u201cIntegrating  Asia\u201d  (see  definitions \nin  the  appendix  to  this  chapter)  accounts  for  87%  of  the  region\u2019s \npopulation  and  96%  of  its  output  (Table  1.1)\u2014hence,  it  is  often \n\n1  \u201cRegionalism\u201d and related terms used in this study are defined in the Glossary.\n\n10\n\n\freferred to simply as Asia2\u2014and conducts more than half of its trade \nwith itself. It includes some of the world\u2019s wealthiest economies and \nsome  of  its  poorest,  large  continental  powers  as  well  as  small  city-\nstates, continuously independent countries and former colonies. Its \nstrength  derives  from  the  openness,  diversity,  and  dynamism  of  its \ninterconnected economies. \nAsian  economies  are  principally  connected  through  markets\u2014\n \nbut  where  markets  lead,  governments  are  following.  Asian  leaders \nhave  committed  to  work  together  more  closely  and  have  already \ntaken  concrete  steps  in  some  areas.  The  1997/98  financial  crisis,  in \nparticular, was an important catalyst for this new regionalism and gave \nrise to a range of new initiatives. These have not sought to replicate \nthe institutions of the European Union (EU), but have rather focused \non  finding  new  and  flexible  forms  of  cooperation  that  reflect  the \nregion\u2019s diversity and pragmatism. Nor are Asia\u2019s regional initiatives \nintended  to  replace  global  relationships,  but  rather  to  complement \nthem. It is not a matter of pulling up the drawbridge, but of building \nbridges that connect Asian economies together as well as to the rest \nof the world. \n \nThe stakes could not be higher. A dynamic and outward-looking \nAsian regionalism could bring huge benefits not just to Asia, but to \nthe  world.  It  could  help  sustain  the  region\u2019s  growth,  underpin  its \nstability, and\u2014with the right policies\u2014reduce inequality. And it could \nhelp marshal a common response to major new challenges that often \narise  suddenly  and  unexpectedly.  As  this  study  goes  to  press,  for \ninstance, Asia is grappling with the wrenching economic and financial \nuncertainty sparked by the global credit crunch since August 2007, \nseveral devastating natural disasters, and the pressing need to ensure \naffordable food supplies throughout Asia. A vibrant, integrated Asia \ncould bring the region\u2019s immense intellectual and economic resources \nto  bear  on  these  and  tomorrow\u2019s  challenges.  And  it  could  help \npower  and  stabilize  the  global  economy  by  boosting  productivity, \nraising living standards, and reducing poverty everywhere. A stable, \ncohesive, and productive Asia is thus in everyone\u2019s interest.\n \n\nThis  study  draws  on  the  42  years  of  experience  of  the  Asian \n\n2  East Asian economies dominate the list of Integrating Asia because of their long-\nstanding commitment to outward-oriented development. Their regional links are \ndeeper than those of South, West, or Central Asia. However, this is changing. India \nhas  substantially  realigned its policies toward integration  with global and Asian \nmarkets, and other Asian countries are also following suit.\n\nWhy Asian Regionalism?\n\n11\n\n\fEmerging Asian Regionalism\n\nTable 1.1.

This  knowledge  base  provides  a  unique \nperspective  on  Asia\u2019s  economic  integration  and  the  potential \ncontributions  of  its  emerging  regionalism.  The  report  examines  the \ndrivers of integration, explores options for cooperation, and develops \nrealistic strategies for building a dynamic and open Asian economic \ncommunity. It thus provides insight on the great issues that will help \nto shape Asia\u2019s future.\n\nHow regionalism can benefit Asia\nRegional  cooperation,  effectively  structured  and  implemented,  is  a \npowerful new tool in Asia\u2019s policy arsenal. It can help Asia address \nregional  challenges  as  well  as  provide  stronger  foundations  for  its \nglobal role. An integrated Asia can\n \n\n\u2022  link  the  competitive  strengths  of  its  diverse  economies  in \norder  to  boost  their  productivity  and  sustain  the  region\u2019s \nexceptional growth;\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022  connect  the  region\u2019s  capital  markets  to  enhance  financial \nstability, reduce the cost of capital, and improve opportunities \nfor sharing risks; \n\n\u2022  cooperate  in  setting  exchange  rate  and  macroeconomic \npolicies in order to minimize the effects of global and regional \nshocks and to facilitate the resolution of global imbalances; \n\u2022  pool  the  region\u2019s  foreign  exchange  reserves  to  make  more \n\nresources available for investment and development;\n\n\u2022  exercise  leadership  in  global  decision  making  to  sustain  the \nopen global trade and financial systems that have supported a \nhalf century of unparalleled economic development;\n\n\u2022  build  connected  infrastructure  and  collaborate  on  inclusive \ninequalities  within  and  across \ndevelopment  to  reduce \neconomies  and  thus  to  strengthen  support  for  pro-growth \npolicies; and\n\n\u2022  create  regional  mechanisms  to  manage  cross-border  health, \n\nsafety, and environmental issues better. \n\n \nThe  opportunities  are  clear,  which  is  why  regional  integration \ndeserves a high priority in national policy making. Yet the challenge \nof  cooperation  should  not  be  underestimated;  it  will  require  trust, \ninnovation,  and  compromise\u2014and,  most  likely,  time.  Policy  makers \nat  the  highest  levels  appear  committed  to  pushing  the  regional \nagenda forward, but considerable leadership and energy are needed \nto achieve results. \n\nWhy Asian Regionalism?\n\n13\n\n\fEmerging Asian Regionalism\n\n14\n\n \nThese benefits from cooperation could extend also to developing \nAsian  economies  that  are  not  yet  part  of  the  region\u2019s  integrating \ncore.  Indeed,  in  relative  terms,  newcomers  to  regional  integration \nhave the most to gain from the expanded opportunities for economic \ndevelopment that it provides. Hence, an important aim of this study \nis  to  make  the  case  for  integration  to  countries  that  have  not  yet \nadopted  an  outward-oriented  development  strategy  and  to  provide \nguidance on how to build stronger regional connections.\n\nHow Asian regionalism can benefit the world\nThe  rest  of  the  world  could  benefit,  too.  So  long  as  Asia\u2019s \neconomies  continue  to  integrate  not  just  with  each  other,  but \nalso  with  the  rest  of  the  world,  sustained  Asian  dynamism, \nstrengthened  by  regional  cooperation,  could  bolster  Asia\u2019s \nrole  as  a  new  and  stabilizing  engine  of  global  economic \ngrowth.  There  are  many  reasons  why  Asia  is  likely  to  remain  \noutward-looking\u2014not least because its economy is in large part built \non economies of scale and scope in manufacturing and so requires \nglobal  markets  to  perform  at  its  potential.  Indeed,  because  an \nintegrated Asia will continue to have a powerful stake in the global \neconomy, it would have both an incentive and the leverage to play a \nbigger role in keeping global markets open and vibrant. An integrated \nAsia can\n \n\n\u2022  generate productivity gains, new ideas, and competition that \nboost economic growth and raise incomes across the world;\n\u2022  contribute  to  the  efficiency  and  stability  of  global  financial \nmarkets by making Asian capital markets stronger and safer, \nand by maximizing the productive use of Asian savings;\n\n \n\n\u2022  diversify  sources  of  global  demand,  helping  to  stabilize \nthe  world  economy  and  diminish  the  risks  posed  by  global \nimbalances and downturns in other major economies;\n\n\u2022  provide  leadership  to  help  sustain  open  global  trade  and \n\nfinancial systems; and \n\n\u2022  create  regional  mechanisms  to  manage  health,  safety,  and \nenvironmental  issues  better,  and  thus  contribute  to  more \neffective global solutions of these problems. \n\n  While  Asian  regionalism  is  primarily  motivated  by  the  desire \nto  advance  welfare  in  the  region,  it  would  not  do  so  by  detracting \nfrom development elsewhere. On the contrary, Asian regionalism can \nhelp to sustain global economic progress at a time when other major \nregions are reaching economic maturity.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f1.1.\t\tThe\teconomics\tof\tregionalism\nThe economics of regionalism have a complex and troubled history. In \nthe 1930s, countries created preferential trade blocs in an attempt to \nshelter their economies from the Great Depression. Several countries \nestablished  discriminatory  currency  blocs  with  strict  exchange \ncontrols against outsiders. Far from helping, these arrangements led to \nthe collapse of international trade and financial flows, accelerating the \ndownward spiral of economic activity. This experience was foremost \nin the mind of the architects of the post-war global economic system \nas they adopted the principle of nondiscrimination as a central pillar \nof the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the forerunner \nof the World Trade Organization (WTO). Many economists and policy \nmakers remain skeptical about regionalism because of its potentially \nnegative impact on the multilateral trade and financial system. \n \nThe case for regionalism therefore has to be carefully formulated. \nRegionalism must  not lead  to protectionist  blocs\u2014a \u201cfortress Asia\u201d \nis  no  more  desirable  than  a  \u201cfortress  Europe\u201d  or  a  \u201cfortress  North \nAmerica\u201d would be. But the open, outward-oriented regionalism that \nis emerging in Asia can avoid posing such a threat. Just as the absence \nof barriers to commerce within national economies\u2014that is, among \nthe states and provinces of countries such as the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC), India, Germany,3 and the United States (US)\u2014is generally \nbeneficial, so too is the creation of a market spanning several national \neconomies.4 Much of the evidence assembled in this report suggests \nthat  Asia  has\u2014and  will  continue  to  have\u2014a  fundamental  stake  in \nboth regional and global integration.\n \nThe  case  for  collective  action  arises  from  market  failures  that \nreduce economic welfare in the absence of official measures. The case \nfor regional cooperation is still more specific: it addresses problems \nthat  are  inherently  regional  in  scope  or,  for  other  reasons,  cannot \nbe  solved  at  a  global  or  national  level.  Rapid  regional  growth  and \nintegration  generate  new  commercial  opportunities  and  demands \nfor  governmental  cooperation  and  institutional  development.  But \n\n3    The  1834  Zollverein,  a  customs  union  of  the  18  small  states  that  eventually \nformed Germany, is an early example of the elimination of barriers in territories \nthat later also formed a political union. \n4    The  potential  value  of  this  approach  is  recognized  in  the  multilateral  trading \nsystem: Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) permits \nthe establishment of free trade areas, provided that they encompass \u201csubstantially \nall the trade between the constituent territories\u201d and do not increase the barriers \nfaced by excluded countries.\n\nWhy Asian Regionalism?\n\n15\n\n\fEmerging Asian Regionalism\n\n16\n\nbecause  regional  action  could  introduce  new  distortions,  global \ncooperation  is  often  preferable.  In  practice,  though,  reaching  and \nimplementing  global  agreements  is  difficult,  and  international \nmarket failures that ideally ought to be addressed globally often are \nnot.  Regional  solutions  can  be  better  targeted  and  are  often  more \nachievable. Important priorities for regional collective action are as \nfollows:\n \n\n\u2022\t Provide\t public\t goods\t that\t are\t unlikely\t to\t be\t produced\t by\t\nmarkets\t or\t individual\t economies.  These  include  measures \nto  head  off  international  epidemics,  respond  to  natural \ndisasters, and develop and disseminate knowledge, including \ntechnological  and  scientific  findings  as  well  as  policy \nexperience in areas such as financial regulation, pensions, and \npoverty reduction. \n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\u2022\t Manage\tthe\tspillover\teffects\tof\teconomic\tactivity\tand\tpolicy\t\namong\t connected\t economies.\t These  inevitably  grow  with \ndeeper economic integration. The regional contagion observed \nduring  the  1997/98  financial  crisis  is  an  important  example, \nas concerns about liquidity and financial management in one \ncountry  led  to  runs,  speculative  attacks,  and  dislocation  in \nothers. But routine macroeconomic changes\u2014such as interest \nrate  or  currency  movements\u2014can  also  have  significant \nimpacts.  This  calls  for  monitoring  regional  macroeconomic \nactivity  as  well  as  for  policy  dialogue.  Cross-border  effects \nmay also be significant in many other policy areas, notably the \nenvironment and migration. \n\n\u2022\t Coordinate\t regional\t policy\t approaches\t to\t projects\t or\t\ndecisions\t that\t affect\t several\t economies.\t Such  efforts  can \nrange  from  the  palpable  need  to  cooperate  on  investments \nin  trade-oriented  transport,  communications,  and  policy \ninfrastructure  links  to  more  complex  initiatives,  such  as \nharmonizing  regional  approaches  in  international  forums. \nFor instance, the combined efforts of Asian economies could \nsignificantly enhance the prospects for a successful conclusion \nof WTO\u2019s Doha Round, an outcome that would benefit Asia and \nthe world at large. \n\n\u2022\t Liberalize\t trade\t and\t investment  beyond\t levels\t achievable\t\nthrough\t global\t negotiations.  This  can  be  accomplished \nby  establishing  rules  and  institutions  that  enable  countries \nto  further  integrate  markets  and  by  helping  to  harmonize \nstandards, regulations, and processes so that businesses can \noperate more effectively in different economies. \n\n\f\t\n\n\u2022\t Add\t value\t to\t national\t policy\t making.  Efforts  can  include \nsharing best practices and highlighting priorities that may run \ncounter  to  domestic  special  interests,  such  as  measures  to \nenhance competition and regulatory oversight, reduce poverty \nand inequality, and control environmental externalities.\n\n \nThe  case  for  regionalism  is  neither  automatic  nor  self-evident; \ngoodwill  among  countries  does  not  necessarily  make  for  good \neconomic  policy.  Regional  cooperation  may  be  less  desirable \nthan  global  cooperation,  and  it  may  even  be  worse  than  inaction. \nTheoretically,  removing  some  barriers  could  reduce  welfare  rather \nthan  increase  it.  Regional  cooperation  is  therefore  not  a  goal  to  be \npursued for its own sake; it is a means for achieving more fundamental \nobjectives. But, subject to these cautions, concerted regional action \nis  a  powerful\u2014and,  in  some  cases,  essential\u2014tool  for  promoting \nefficient regional economic development. \n\n1.2.\tThe\tchallenge\tof\tcooperation\ninterdependence  provides  many \nAsia\u2019s  growing  economic \nopportunities  for  cooperation.  These  are  divided  into  four  major \nareas  in  this  study:  (1)  trade,  investment,  and  the  integration  of \n\u201creal\u201d economic activity; (2) financial integration; (3) macroeconomic \npolicy links; and (4) shared social and environmental concerns. The \nstudy  analyzes  the  progress  of  market-based  integration  in  each  of \nthese  areas.  It  also  explores  opportunities  for  intergovernmental \ncooperation\u2014or, in economic terminology, identifies potential market \nfailures and coordination problems that are best addressed through \nregional collective action. It additionally examines the architecture of \narrangements that might enable such collaborations. The framework \nof this analysis is summarized in Table 1.2.\n \nfor  cooperation,  marshaling \nDespite  the  compelling  case \ngovernments\u2019  efforts  across  this  vast,  diverse  region  is  a  daunting \nchallenge.  The  examples  of  the  EU  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  the \nNorth  American  Free  Trade  Agreement  (NAFTA)  highlight  some  of \nthe  difficulties  involved.  But  Asia  is  not  Europe  or  North  America; \nits  economy,  history,  and  politics  are  different.  Some  types  of \nintegration\u2014for example, trade\u2014are deeper in Asia today than they \nwere  in  Europe  in  the  early  stages  of  European  regionalism  in  the \n1950s and 1960s. But other areas\u2014monetary policy, for instance\u2014still \ninvolve largely independent national decisions. While Asia can draw \non other regions\u2019 experience, Asian regionalism is ultimately likely to \n\nWhy Asian Regionalism?\n\n17\n\n\fEmerging Asian Regionalism\n\nTable 1.2.

Asia \ncomprises several powerful countries and centers of economic activity, \nwith many shared economic priorities, but also some diverging ones. \nAt times, these differences are amplified by history and politics. The \nprice of cooperation is the loss of some national sovereignty and the \nnarrowing of policy options for pursuing purely national objectives. \nIt  is  understandably  difficult  for  large,  successful,  and  independent \neconomies to make such compromises, and ultimately to pool some \n\n18\n\n\fWhy Asian Regionalism?\n\nsovereignty within regional institutions. Cooperation is therefore likely \nto  evolve  gradually,  with  different  groups  of  countries  progressing \nat varying speeds, using several frameworks and forums to address \nsubsets of policy interests. Such a multitrack, multispeed approach is \nlikely to offer the most efficient framework for cooperation in Asia.\n \nAsia\u2019s  approach  to  regionalism  is  likely  to  have  other  distinct \ncharacteristics as well. The region\u2019s policy-making style is typically \npragmatic  and  cautious.  Cooperation  is  primarily  aimed  at  making \nmarkets  work  better  and  tends  to  be  limited  to  specific  initiatives \nand  objectives.  Although  intergovernmental  dialogue  at  all  levels \nhas  greatly  increased,  formal  regional  institutions  remain  relatively \nunderdeveloped.  These  are  likely  to  gain  traction  only  insofar  as \nthey  promise  and,  eventually,  deliver  tangible  benefits\u2014not  just  to \nelite groups, but to the population as a whole. The public appears to \nhave positive expectations of regionalism. A study conducted for this \nreport, based on a region-wide survey of opinion leaders, indicates \nthat Asians generally see regional integration as beneficial, a strategy \nfor  enhancing  the  welfare  of  participating  countries  while  leaving \nothers no worse off. The survey is discussed in Box 1.1.\n\nBox 1.1. Perceptions of economic interdependence in Asia\n\nAre  Asian  leaders  positive  about  regional \n\ncooperation?  Yes,  according  to  a  recent \nsurvey  of  600  Asian  opinion \nleaders \nconducted  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank. \nRespondents  believe  that  the  advantages  of \ncloser  economic  relations  within  Asia  outweigh \nthe  costs,  and  they  support  the  creation  of  an \nAsian  economic  community.  Their  approach  is \npragmatic: they favor a step-by-step approach to \nintegration and believe that regionalism provides \nopportunities for \u201cwin-win\u201d outcomes throughout \nthe region (Capannelli 2008).1  \n\n1  The  survey  was  conducted  in  August\u2013September  2007 \nand  collected  responses  from  600  Asian  opinion  leaders \nin business, media, government, and academia. The study \ncovered  12  countries,  with  roughly  equal  representation \nfrom East Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia. \n\nAssessment of current economic \ninterdependence\nAsian  opinion  leaders  see  regional  economic \nrelations as strongest in trade and investment, and \nreasonably significant in money and finance. They \nbelieve that governments are not sufficiently active \nin  developing  regional  mechanisms  for  coping \nwith  health,  environmental,  and  other  cross-\nborder  challenges.  And  they  see  great  potential, \nin  developing \nlittle  progress, \nbut  relatively \ncross-border  infrastructure.  Respondents  from \nSoutheast  Asia  generally  see  economic  relations \nwith  neighbors  as  more  intense  than  those  from \nother subregions do.\n \nRegional  integration  is  viewed  as  benefiting \nAsia  through  faster  economic  growth,  deeper \nintegration  with  the  world  economy,  and  a \n\n19\n\n\fEmerging Asian Regionalism\n\nBox 1.1. continued\n\nstronger  Asian  voice  in  global  economic  forums \n(Figure B1.1).

But building an Asian economic community \nis  a  long-term  undertaking,  and  the  economic  climate  cannot  be \nexpected to remain consistently favorable. \n \nSome  risks  are  known.  Global  demand  and  financial  stability \nare  important  to  Asia  and  could  be  compromised  by  a  deepening \ncredit crisis; a falling dollar; a sudden unwinding of current account \nimbalances; and/or rapidly rising energy, food, and other commodity \nprices.  Other  shocks,  including  adverse  effects  of  global  warming, \ncould  become  more  severe  over  time.  In  Asia  as  well,  after  a  long \nperiod  of  economic  expansion  (in  some  countries  stretching  back \nnearly  two  decades),  there  are  bound  to  be  financial  reversals  and \neconomic slowdowns due to business cycles whether they originate \nin  the  region  or  elsewhere,  and  to  longer  term  challenges  such  as \nexcess  savings  and  population  ageing.  New  health  or  security \nthreats could make the flow of people and goods more difficult and \nexpensive.  Environmental  damage  could  result  in  radical  changes \nin economic policies. Social instability could generate tensions and \nuncertainty that overwhelm economic progress. Many of these risks \ncan be diminished with adequate foresight and cooperation, and some \nstrategies for doing so are addressed by this study. But not all risks \ncan be known, and the unexpected often has the greatest impact. \n \nUnanticipated developments could set Asian regionalism back\u2014\nor  accelerate  it.  The  1997/98  financial  crisis  stimulated  greater \nregional cooperation and a greater commitment to integration. Asian \ngovernments now realize more clearly that they face a wide range of \ncommon  challenges\u2014such  as  financial  contagion  as  well  as  deadly \ndiseases  like  severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  (SARS)  and  avian \nflu\u2014and have much to gain from addressing them jointly. \n \nIn  some  respects,  regional  cooperation  is  a  form  of  insurance. \nPotential  problem  areas  can  be  monitored,  for  instance,  through \nAsia\u2019s  new  mechanisms  for  macroeconomic  policy  surveillance. \nCoordinated  policy  responses  can  head  off  problems  or  at  least \nminimize  their  impact.  Cooperative  mechanisms  can  even  limit \nthe impact of risks that cannot be identified in advance. The dense \nnetwork  of  consultative  arrangements  that  Asia  is  building  can \nprovide an early warning system and rapid response mechanism for \nemerging threats. \n\n\fWhy Asian Regionalism?\n\n1.3.\t\tPlan\tof\tthe\tstudy\t\nThis  study  examines  the  economic  rationale  for  Asian  regionalism, \nwith a focus on trade, financial, macroeconomic, social, and related \nissues such as the environment and population ageing. It assembles \nevidence  on  deepening  ties  among  Asian  economies  and  offers \noptions  for  regional  policy,  including  the  architecture  of  regional \ncooperation.  These  are  challenging  tasks,  in  part  because  the  ties \nthat  bind  the  region  together  are  complex  and  interdependent. \nRegional  cooperation  must  be  viewed  as  a  comprehensive  strategy \nfor achieving wide economic and social goals. The time horizon of the \nstudy is 2020, but it will be also necessary to look further ahead to set \nthe context for the region\u2019s policy in the longer term. \n \nChapter 2 provides an overview of Asian regional integration and \nopportunities for regional cooperation. The subsequent four chapters \naddress  the  functional  channels  that  connect  Asian  economies: \ntrade  and  investment  (Chapter  3),  financial  markets  (Chapter  4), \nmacroeconomic  policies  (Chapter  5),  and  social  and  environmental \nissues (Chapter 6). These threads are brought together in an analysis \nof the architecture of regional cooperation (Chapter 7). The concluding \nchapter (Chapter 8) considers the implications of the study for the \nway ahead.\n\n23\n\n\fEmerging Asian Regionalism\n\nChapter 1:\tappendix\n\nIntegrating\tAsia:\ta\tdefinition\nHow  far  might  an  Asian  economic  community  extend?  Asia\u2019s \ngeographical  boundaries  are  not  generally  agreed,  and  geography \nalone will not determine the locus of regional cooperation. Rather, the \nshape of \u201cIntegrating Asia\u201d will be determined by the economic and \npolitical ties that connect its members and by the commitment that \nits governments make to cooperation. This study does not prejudge \nthose patterns, although Chapter 7 provides an overview of some of \nthe options. Cooperation is likely to remain fluid for some time, with \ndifferent  groups  of  countries  using  different  structures  to  address \nshared interests. \n \nThis  study  focuses  on  a  group  of  16  economies  that  represent \nIntegrating Asia in the sense that they already have substantial regional \neconomic ties. The group includes the 10 members of the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)\u2014Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, \nLao  People's  Democratic  Republic,  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  Myanmar, \nPhilippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam\u2014as well as People's \nRepublic of China; Hong Kong, China; India; Japan; the  Republic of \nKorea; and Taipei,China. \n \nThis group is somewhat arbitrary. Some scholars might argue that \nit should include other West and South Asian economies, even though \ntheir primary economic connections are so far with other regions. A \ncase could also be made for including countries in Central Asia that \nare  developing  subregional  ties  but  are  still  only  loosely  integrated \nwith the region as a whole. Some might also wish to include Australia, \nNew  Zealand,  and  the  Pacific,  because  their  economic  ties  to  the \nregion are very strong, even though they lie some distance from the \nAsian landmass. Indeed, all of these countries participate in one or \nmore cooperative arrangements involving Asian economies. \n\n24\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["Emerging Asian Regionalism\n", "Chapter 1\nWhy Asian regionalism?\n", "The center of gravity of the global economy is shifting to \n", "Asia. The region\u2019s economy is already similar in size to \nthose of Europe and North America, and its influence in \nthe world continues to increase. In many Asian countries, \nthe  cycle  of  poverty  has  been  broken;  in  others,  this \nhistoric aim is within sight. Asia\u2019s extraordinary success has brought \nnew  challenges\u2014while  rapid  economic  growth  remains  a  priority, \ncitizens demand that it also be sustainable and more inclusive. And \nAsia  is  now  so  important  to  the  world  economy  that  it  must  also \nplay a larger role in global economic leadership. Regional economic \ncooperation is essential for addressing these challenges.\n \nAsia\u2019s  economic  rise  is  unprecedented.  The  region  is  home  to \nover  half  the  world\u2019s  population,  produces  three  tenths  of  global \noutput (in terms of purchasing power), and consistently records the \nworld\u2019s highest economic growth rates. The Asian \u201cmiracle\u201d (World \nBank 1993) did not end with the 1997/98 financial crisis a decade ago; \nfor some countries, it marked the beginning of renewed acceleration. \nThe  question  is  no  longer  whether  Asia  will  be  central  to  the  21st \ncentury economy, but rather how it will exercise its prominent role \nand how its dependence on the rest of the world has decreased. \nRegionalism  is  a  relatively  new  aspect  of  Asia\u2019s  rise.1  Asia\u2019s \n \neconomies  are  increasingly  connected  through  trade,  financial \ntransactions, direct investment, technology, labor and tourist flows, \nand  other  economic  relationships.  This  study  focuses  on  16  Asian \neconomies that are already, in some respects, as closely intertwined \nas  Europe\u2019s  single  market.  This  \u201cIntegrating  Asia\u201d  (see  definitions \nin  the  appendix  to  this  chapter)  accounts  for  87%  of  the  region\u2019s \npopulation  and  96%  of  its  output  (Table  1.1)\u2014hence,  it  is  often \n", "1  \u201cRegionalism\u201d and related terms used in this study are defined in the Glossary.\n", "10\n", "referred to simply as Asia2\u2014and conducts more than half of its trade \nwith itself. It includes some of the world\u2019s wealthiest economies and \nsome  of  its  poorest,  large  continental  powers  as  well  as  small  city-\nstates, continuously independent countries and former colonies. Its \nstrength  derives  from  the  openness,  diversity,  and  dynamism  of  its \ninterconnected economies. \nAsian  economies  are  principally  connected  through  markets\u2014\n \nbut  where  markets  lead,  governments  are  following.  Asian  leaders \nhave  committed  to  work  together  more  closely  and  have  already \ntaken  concrete  steps  in  some  areas.  The  1997/98  financial  crisis,  in \nparticular, was an important catalyst for this new regionalism and gave \nrise to a range of new initiatives. These have not sought to replicate \nthe institutions of the European Union (EU), but have rather focused \non  finding  new  and  flexible  forms  of  cooperation  that  reflect  the \nregion\u2019s diversity and pragmatism. Nor are Asia\u2019s regional initiatives \nintended  to  replace  global  relationships,  but  rather  to  complement \nthem. It is not a matter of pulling up the drawbridge, but of building \nbridges that connect Asian economies together as well as to the rest \nof the world. \n \nThe stakes could not be higher. A dynamic and outward-looking \nAsian regionalism could bring huge benefits not just to Asia, but to \nthe  world.  It  could  help  sustain  the  region\u2019s  growth,  underpin  its \nstability, and\u2014with the right policies\u2014reduce inequality. And it could \nhelp marshal a common response to major new challenges that often \narise  suddenly  and  unexpectedly.  As  this  study  goes  to  press,  for \ninstance, Asia is grappling with the wrenching economic and financial \nuncertainty sparked by the global credit crunch since August 2007, \nseveral devastating natural disasters, and the pressing need to ensure \naffordable food supplies throughout Asia. A vibrant, integrated Asia \ncould bring the region\u2019s immense intellectual and economic resources \nto  bear  on  these  and  tomorrow\u2019s  challenges.  And  it  could  help \npower  and  stabilize  the  global  economy  by  boosting  productivity, \nraising living standards, and reducing poverty everywhere. A stable, \ncohesive, and productive Asia is thus in everyone\u2019s interest.\n \n", "This  study  draws  on  the  42  years  of  experience  of  the  Asian \n", "2  East Asian economies dominate the list of Integrating Asia because of their long-\nstanding commitment to outward-oriented development.
