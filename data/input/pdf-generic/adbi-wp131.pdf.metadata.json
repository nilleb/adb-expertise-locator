The results suggest that the aggregate impacts of \nagricultural  damages  caused  by  climate  change  on  the  global  economy  are  moderate. \nHowever,  the  uneven  distribution  of  productivity  losses  across  global  regions  would  bring \nsignificant  structural  adjustments  in  worldwide  agricultural  production  and  trade,  ultimately \nleaving the developing world as a net loser.

However, the expected increase of \ncrop  import  dependence  in  the  coming  decades  would  make  most  Southeast  Asian \neconomies suffer more welfare losses through deteriorated terms of trade. Depending on a \ncountry\u2019s economic structure, the negative effects are expected to be less for Singapore and \nMalaysia, but greater for Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, and Viet Nam. For Southeast Asia \nto cope with the potential agricultural damages arising from the expected changes in climate \nthe  region  must  concentrate  on  reversing  its  current  trend  of  declining  agricultural \nproductivity. \n\n \nJEL Classification: D58, C68, Q54, Q11 \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 131 \n \n\nContents \n\n \n\n \n\nZhai and Zhuang \n\nIntroduction .................................................................................................................. 1 \n\nClimate Change and Agriculture ................................................................................. 2 \n\nThe Model ................................................................................................................... 5 \n\nSimulations and Results .............................................................................................. 6 \n\n4.1 \n4.2 \n4.3 \n\nGlobal Impacts ................................................................................................ 7 \nImpacts on Southeast Asian Countries ......................................................... 10 \nSensitivity to the Assumption About  \nBaseline Agricultural Productivity Growth ...................................................... 13 \n\n5. \n\nConclusions ............................................................................................................... 14 \n\nReferences ............................................................................................................................ 16 \n\n \n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 131 \n \n\n1.  INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nZhai and Zhuang \n\nRecent  scientific  research  has  concluded  that  the  increased  atmospheric  concentration  of \ngreenhouse gases will have significant impacts on the Earth\u2019s climate in the coming decades. \nAssuming  no  emission  control  policies,  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  of  Climate  Change \n(IPCC)  predicted  that  average  global  surface  temperatures  will  increase  by  2.8\u00baC  on \naverage  during  this  century,  with  best-guess  increases  ranging  from  1.8  and  4.0\u00baC  (IPCC \n2007a).  Global  warming  would  alter  natural  climate  and  environmental  systems  in  many \nways,  leading  to  an  increased  frequency  of  extreme  weather  events,  rising  sea  levels,  a \nreversal  of  ocean  currents,  and  changes  in  precipitation  patterns.  These  changes  could \nimpact social-economic activities, with serious implications for the well being of humans long \ninto the future.  \n\nAgriculture is one of the most vulnerable sectors to the anticipated climate change. Despite \nthe technological advances in the second half of 20th century, including the Green Revolution, \nweather and climate are still key factors in determining agricultural productivity in most areas \nof  the  world.  The  predicted  changes  in  temperatures  and  rainfall  patterns,  as  well  as  their \nassociated impacts on water availability, pests, disease, and extreme weather events are all \nlikely  to  affect  substantially  the  potential  of  agricultural  production.  Literature  on  the \neconomics of climate change suggests that although global crop production may be boosted \nslightly by global warming in the short term (before 2030), it will ultimately turn negative over \nthe longer term (Bruinsma 2003; IPCC 2007b). Moreover, the impact of climate change on \nagricultural  production  is  unlikely  to  be  evenly  distributed  across  regions.  Low  latitude  and \ndeveloping  countries  are  expected  to  suffer  more  from  the  agricultural  effects  of  global \nwarming,  reflecting  their  disadvantaged  geographic  location,  greater  agricultural  share  in \ntheir economies, and limited ability to adapt to climate change. In contrast, crop production in \nhigh  latitude  regions  will  generally  benefit  from  climate  change.  In  a  recent  global \ncomprehensive  estimate  for  over  100  countries,  Cline  (2007)  predicted  that  global \nagricultural  productivity  would  fall  by  15.9%  in  the  2080s  if  global  warming  continues \nunabated,  with  developing  countries  experiencing  a  disproportionately  larger  decline  of \n19.7%. \n\nAgriculture plays an important role in Southeast Asia, contributing to more than 10% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) in most regional economies, and providing jobs for over one third of \nthe working population in the region. As is the case in other developing regions of the world, \nnearly three fourths of the poor in Southeast Asia reside in rural areas, and a large majority \nof them are dependent on agriculture. Consequently, agricultural development has important \nimplications  for  the  reduction  of  poverty  in  Southeast  Asia.  Moreover,  the  increased \nexposure of Southeast Asia\u2019s agriculture sector to international trade means that any climate \nchange-related  shocks  in  international  markets  for  agricultural  products  will  be  easily \ntransmitted to the region through trade channels.  \n\nThis  paper  used  a  dynamic  computable  general  equilibrium  (CGE)  model  of  the  global \neconomy to investigate the potential impacts of climate change on agriculture and the world \neconomy,  with  a  special  focus  on  Southeast  Asia.  The  CGE  model  is  an  economy-wide \nmodel  that  elucidates  interactions  among  industries,  consumers  and  governments  across \nthe  global  economy.  The  detailed  region  and  sector  disaggregation  of  the  model  makes  it \npossible  to  capture  the  spillover  effects  of  sector-  or  country-specific  shocks.  Climate \nchanges  impact  an  economy  directly  through  the  effects  on  that  economy\u2019s  agricultural \noutputs and indirectly through changes in the agricultural production of other countries. We \nestablished this distinction by comparing the scenario of agricultural productivity shrinkage in \nSoutheast Asia to the scenario of agricultural productivity shrinkage in the rest of the world. \nThe role of productivity growth in adapting to the climate change was also examined. \n\nSection 2 of this paper  discusses the relationship between climate change and agricultural \nproduction  by  reviewing  the  existing  literature  in  which  various  modeling  approaches  have \n\n 1\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 131 \n \n\n \n\nZhai and Zhuang \n\nbeen  employed  to  estimate  the  impacts  of  climate  change  on  agricultural  productivity.  We \nthen describe the specifications of the CGE model used in this study in Section 3. Section 4 \nassesses  the  impacts  of  climate  change-induced  global  agricultural  productivity  decline  on \nagricultural production, trade and macro-economy. The final section offers conclusions. \n\n2.  CLIMATE CHANGE AND AGRICULTURE \n\nClimate  can  affect  agriculture  in  a  variety  of  ways.  Temperature,  radiation,  rainfall,  soil \nmoisture  and  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  concentration  are  all  important  variables  to  determine \nagricultural  productivity,  and  their  relationships  are  not  simply  linear.  Current  research \nconfirms  that  there  are  thresholds  for  these  climate  variables  above  which  crop  yields \ndecline  (Challinor  et  al.  2005;  Proter  and  Semenov  2005).  For  example,  the  modeling \nstudies  discussed  in  recent  IPCC  reports  indicate  that  moderate  to  medium  increases  in \nmean  temperature  (1\u20133\u00baC),  along  with  associated  CO2  increases  and  rainfall  changes,  are \nexpected  to  benefit  crop  yields  in  temperate  regions.  However,  in  low-latitude  regions, \nmoderate temperature increases (1\u20132\u00baC) are likely to have negative yield impacts for major \ncereals.  Warming  of  more  than  3\u00baC  would  have  negative  impacts  in  all  regions  (IPCC \n2007b). \n\nThe  interaction  of  temperature  increases  and  changing  rainfall  patterns  determines  the \nimpact  of  climate  change  on  soil  moisture.  With  rising  temperatures,  both  evaporation  and \nprecipitation  are  expected  to  increase.  The  resulting  net  effect  on  water  availability  would \ndepend on which force is more dominant. The IPCC reports project that by the middle of the \n21st century, water availability will increase as a result of climate change at high latitudes and \nin some wet tropical areas, and decrease over some dry regions at mid-latitudes and in the \ndry  tropics  (IPCC  2007b).  Some  regions  that  are  already  drought-prone  may  suffer  more \nsevere dry periods.  \n\nIncreases in atmospheric CO2 concentration can have a positive impact on crops yields by \nstimulating  plant  photosynthesis  and  reducing  the  water  loss  via  plant  respiration.  This \ncarbon  fertilization  effect  is  strong  for  so-called  C3  crops,1 such  as  rice,  wheat,  soybeans, \nfine grains,  legumes, and most trees, which have a  lower rate of photosynthetic efficiency. \nFor C4  crops  like  maize, millet,  sorghum, sugarcane, and  many grasses, these effects are \nmuch smaller. Other factors such as a plant\u2019s growth stage, or the application of water and \nnitrogen, can also impact the effect of elevated CO2 on plant yield. Recent research based \non experiments with the free air concentration enrichment method suggests a much smaller \nCO2  fertilization  effect  on  yield  for  C3  crops  and  little  or  no  stimulation  for  C4  crops,  in \ncomparison  with  past  estimates  from  studies  conducted  under  enclosed  test  conditions \n(Long  et  al.  2005,  2006).  Based  on  analysis  of  recent  data,  the  IPCC  reports  suggest  that \nyields may increase by 10\u201325% for C3 crops and by 0\u201310% for C4 crops when CO2 levels \nreach 550ppm (IPCC 2007b). However, as a number of limiting factors were not included in \nthe  modeling  and  experiment  analysis,  considerable  uncertainties  still  surround  the \nestimates of carbon fertilization effect. \n\nBesides temperature and carbon concentration, some other ecological changes brought on \nby global warming will have an impact on agriculture. For example, the patterns of pests and \ndiseases may change  with  climate change, leading to reductions in agricultural production. \nMoreover,  agricultural  productivity  will  be  depressed  by  increased  climate  variability  and \nincreased  intensity  and  frequency  of  extreme  events  such  a  drought  and  floods.  These \nfactors  further  contribute  to  the  difficulties  in  estimating  the  impacts  of  climate  change  on \nagricultural productivity. \n\n                                                 \n1 Crops  are  generally  divided  into  two  groups,  C3  and  C4,  depending  on  their  efficiency  of  use  of  CO2  during \n\nphotosynthesis.  \n\n2 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 131 \n \n\n \n\nZhai and Zhuang \n\nQuantitative estimates of the agricultural impact of climate change have predominantly relied \non  three  approaches:  crop  simulation  models,  agro-ecological  zone  (AEZ)  models,  and \ncross-section  (Ricardian)  models.  Crop  simulation  models  draw  on  controlled  experiments \nwhere crops are grown in field or laboratory settings simulating different climates and levels \nof CO2 in order to estimate yield responses of a specific crop variety to certain climates, and \nother  variables  of  interest.2 These  models  do  not  include  farmer  adaptation  to  changing \nclimate  conditions  in  the  estimates.  Consequently,  their  results  tend  to  overstate  the \ndamages  of  climate  change  to  agricultural  production  (Mendelsohn  and  Dinar  1999).  The \nsecond  approach,  AEZ  analysis,  combines  crop  simulation  models  with  land  management \ndecision analysis, and captures the changes in agro-climatic resources (Darwin et al. 1995; \nFishcher  et  al.  2005).  AEZ  analysis  categorizes  existing  lands  by  agro-ecological  zones, \nwhich differ in the length of growing period and climatic zone. The length of growing period is \ndefined  based  on  temperature,  precipitation,  soil  characteristics,  and  topography.  The \nchanges of the distribution of the crop zones along with climate change are tracked in AEZ \nmodels.  Crop  modeling  and  environmental  matching  procedures  are  used  to  identify  crop-\nspecific environmental limitations under various levels of inputs and management conditions, \nand provide estimates of the maximum agronomically attainable crops yields for a given land \nresources  unit.  However,  as  the  predicted  potential  attainable  yields  from  AEZ  models  are \noften  much  larger  than  current  actual  yields,  the  models  may  overestimate  the  effects  of \nautonomous adaptation. Cline (2007) observed that AEZ studies tend to attribute excessive \nbenefits  to  the warming  of  cold  high-latitude  regions,  thereby  overstating  global  gains  from \nclimate changes.  \n\nThe  Ricardian  cross-sectional  approach  explores  the  relationship  between  agricultural \ncapacity  (measured  by  land  value)  and  climate  variables  (usually  temperature  and \nprecipitation) on the basis of statistical estimates from farm survey or country-level data. This \napproach  automatically  incorporates  efficient  climate  change  adaptations  by  farmers.  The \nmajor criticisms of the Ricardian approach are its ignorance of price changes and that it fails \nto  fully  control  for  the  impact  of  other  variables  that  affect  farm  incomes  (Mendelsohn  and \nDinar 1999; Cline 1996).  \n\nCline  (2007)  used  both  Ricardian  statistical  models  and  crop  models  to  develop  a  set  of \nconsensus  agricultural  impact  estimates  through  the  2080s  for  over  100  countries.  He  first \ndeveloped  geographically  detailed  projections  for  changes  in  temperature  and  precipitation \nthrough  the  2080s  based  on  a  baseline  emission  projection  from  the  IPCC\u2019s  Emission \nScenarios.  Next,  these  climatic  change  projections  were  applied  to  the  agricultural  impact \nmodels  to  assess  the  effects  of  climate  change  on  agricultural  productivity.  The  final \nconsensus  estimates  were  the  weighted  average  of  the  Ricardian estimates  and  the crops \nmodel estimates. Table 1 presents the major results of Cline\u2019s estimates. \n\n                                                 \n2 For more information on crop simulation models, see Adams et al.

Land areas would warm \nmore than oceans, with the average surface temperature increasing by 5.0\u00baC weighting by \nland area and 4.4\u00baC weighting by farming area. By the 2080s, global agricultural productivity \nwould  decline  by  about  3%  with  carbon  fertilization  effect  and  by  about  16%  if  the  carbon \nfertilization effect did not materialize. These losses would be disproportionately concentrated \nin developing countries, which would suffer losses of 9% with carbon fertilization effect and \n21%  without  carbon  fertilization  effect,  in  contrast  to  an  8%  gain  (with  carbon  fertilization \neffect)  and  6%  loss  (without  carbon  fertilization  effect)  in  industrial  countries.  The  detailed \nestimates  by  country  and  region  reported  in  Table  2  indicate  that  South  Asia  and  Africa \nwould be the two regions most harmed by climate change. In Southeast Asia, the damages \nof climate change to agriculture would also be severe, ranking from 15.1% for Viet Nam to \n26.2% for Thailand if carbon fertilization effect did not materialize. \n\n                                                 \n3 Scenario  A2  is  the  second  highest  emission  scenario  among  the  six  scenarios  considered  by  the  Third  and \nFourth  Assessments  Reports  of  the  IPCC.

THE MODEL  \n\nThe model used in this study was a dynamic, CGE model of the global economy. It was built \non  the  LINKAGE  model  developed  at  the  World  Bank  (van  der  Mensbrugghe  2005; \nAnderson,  Martin,  and  van  der  Mensbrugghe  2006),  and  has  its  intellectual  roots  in  the \ngroup of multi-country applied general equilibrium models used over the past two decades to \nanalyze the global trade and environmental issues (Shoven and Whalley 1992; Hertel 1997). \nThis section describes the major features of the model.  \n\nProduction  in  each  economic  sector  was  modeled  using  nested  constant  elasticity  of \nsubstitution (CES) functions and constant returns to scale was assumed. There were three \ntypes  of  production  structures,  depending  on  activities.  Crop  sectors  reflected  the \nsubstitution possibility between extensive and intensive farming. Livestock sectors reflected \nthe substitution possibility between pasture and intensive feeding. All other sectors reflected \nthe standard capital-labor substitution.  \n\nThe  study  assumed  differentiation  of  products  by  regions  of  origin;  i.e.,  the  Armington \nassumption  (Armington  1969).  Top-level  aggregate  Armington  demand  was  allocated \nbetween goods produced domestically and an aggregate import following a CES function. In \nthe  second  level,  the  aggregate  import  was  further  disaggregated  across  the  various  trade \npartners using an additional CES nest. On the export side, it was assumed that firms treat \ndomestic  markets  and  foreign  markets  indifferently.  Thus  the  law  of  one  price  would  hold; \ni.e., the export price was identical to that of domestic supply.  \n\nIncomes  generated  from  production  were  assumed  to  accrue  to  a  single  representative \nhousehold  in  each  region.  Households  maximized  utility  using  An  Implicitly  Direct  Additive \nDemand System (AIDADS) (Rimmer and Powell 1996). AIDADS is a demand system which \nallows the marginal budget shares to vary as a function of total expenditure. Recent work by \nYu et al. (2004) has demonstrated the superiority of AIDADS over other demand systems in \nprojecting  food  demand,  especially  for  long-term  projections  involving  a  wide  range  of \ncountries.  \n\n5 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 131 \n \n\n \n\nZhai and Zhuang \n\nAll  commodity  and  factor  markets  were  assumed  to  clear  through  prices.  There  are  five \nprimary  factors  of  production:  agricultural  land,  skilled  labor,  unskilled  labor,  capital,  and \nnatural  resources.  Agricultural  land  and  the  two  types  of  labor  were  assumed  to  be  fully \nmobile  across  sectors  within  a  region.  Some  adjustment  rigidities  in  capital  markets  were \nintroduced  through  the  vintage  structure  of  capital,  under  which  the  \u201cnew\u201d  capital  was  fully \nmobile  across  a  sector,  while  \u201cold\u201d  capital  in  a  sector  could  be  disinvested  only  when  this \nsector  was  in  decline.  In  the  natural  resource  sectors  of  forestry,  fishing,  and  mining,  a \nsector-specific  factor  was  introduced  into  the  production  function  to  reflect  the  resource \nconstraints. These sector-specific factors were modeled using upward sloping supply curves. \nFor other primary factors, stocks were fixed for any given year. The numeraire of the model \nwas defined as the manufactured export index of the high-income countries, which was held \nfixed.  \n\nThe model was recursive dynamic, beginning with the base year of 2004 and being solved \nannually  through  2080.  Dynamics  of  the  model  were  driven  by  exogenous  population  and \nlabor growth and technological progress, as well as capital accumulation, which was driven \nby savings. Population and labor force projections were based on the United Nations\u2019 (UN) \nmedium variant forecast. As the UN population forecast covers only 2005\u20132050, the growth \nrates of population and labor forces were assumed to decline exponentially at a rate of 2% \nper  year.  The  household  savings  rate  was  set  as  a  function  of  economic  growth  and \ndemographic changes, which were drawn from a global cross-country analysis by Bosworth \nand Chodorow-Reich (2006). Technological progress was assumed to be labor-augmented, \nso the model could reach a steady state in the long run. \n\nThe  model  was  calibrated  to  the  Global  Trade  Analysis  Project  (GTAP)  version  7,  using \ntwenty-one  countries/regions  and  nineteen  sectors.  There  was  a  heavy  emphasis  on \nagriculture  and  food,  which  account  for  ten  of  the  nineteen  sectors.  Six  Southeast  Asian \ncountries are explicitly modeled as individual regions in the model.  \n\n4.  SIMULATIONS AND RESULTS \n\nA  baseline  scenario  from  2004\u20132080  was  constructed  under  the  assumption  that  there \nwould be no climate change impacts on economic activities. The baseline scenario provided \na reference growth trajectory for examining the effects of climate change-induced agricultural \ndamages.  In  the  baseline,  GDP  growth  up  to  2013  was  exogenous,  derived  from  the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund\u2019s  (IMF)  medium  baseline  projection.  For  each  region,  an \neconomy-wide, labor-augmented productivity grew endogenously over the simulation period \nof  2005\u20132013  to  match  the  pre-specified  GDP  growth  path.  After  2013,  the  productivity \ngrowth rate was held fixed at the level of 2013 up to 2040, and then declined by 1% per year \nafterwards. The supply of agricultural land was assumed to be fixed in high-income countries \nand to grow by 0.12% annually in Asia and 0.2% annually in Latin America, Africa and other \nregions.  \n\nThe baseline scenario projected a high rate of world economic growth over the next seven \ndecades, with global GDP growing by an average of 3.1% per year over the period of 2010\u2013\n2050,  and  slowing  down  to  2.5%  per  year  between  2050  and  2080.  The  average  annual \ngrowth of Southeast Asia over 2010-2080 was 1.1 percentage points higher than that of the \nworld average, and its share in global GDP increased from less than 2% in 2004 to 4.1% in \n2080.  Growth  was  accompanied  by  rapid  structural  change  in  developing  countries.  The \nshare of agricultural value added, in volume terms, would decline from nearly 10% in 2004 to \n3.8% in 2080 in Southeast Asia. Even though some Asian countries like India and Viet Nam \nhad  trade  surpluses  in  agricultural  products  in  the  base  year,  they  would  become  net \nimporters  in  the  next  decade  because  of  the  combined  effects  of  economic  growth, \nindustrialization,  and  land  constraints.  However,  Thailand,  the  Philippines  and  Central  Asia \nwere expected to maintain surpluses in agricultural trade over the projection period. \n\n6 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 131 \n \n\n \n\nZhai and Zhuang \n\nIn the counterfactual scenario with agricultural damages, it was assumed that productivity in \nfour  crop  agricultural  sectors  (paddy  rice,  wheat,  other  grains,  and  other  crops)  would  be \nlower than that in the baseline scenario because of the projected changes in climate. Crop \nproductivity  shocks,  which  were  Cline\u2019s  estimates  without  carbon  fertilization  effect  as \nreported in the first column of Table 2, were imposed gradually over 2009\u20132080. The crop \nproductivity  shocks  were  assumed  to  be  uniform  across  sectors.  The  impacts  of  climate \nchange  were  assessed  by  a  comparison  of  the  counterfactual  scenario  with  the  baseline \nscenario.  \n\n4.1  Global Impacts  \n\nTable 3 presents the simulated impacts on global welfare, GDP, and agricultural production, \nwhich  are  reported  as  percentage  deviation  from  the  \u201cno  damage\u201d  baseline.  The  table \nindicates  that  global  real  GDP  would  decline  by  1.4%  by  2080  as  a  result  of  the predicted \nimpacts  of  climate  change  on  agricultural  productivity.  India  would  suffer  the  largest  GDP \nloss of 6.2%, followed by Sub-Sahara Africa, other South Asian countries, and Central Asia. \nAlthough  the  estimated  productivity  losses  from  Cline\u2019s  study  were  modest  for  the  overall \nCentral  Asia  region,  high  agricultural  shares  in  some  of  the  region\u2019s  national  economies \naccount for the relatively large loss of GDP in Central Asia. Southeast Asia would see a drop \nin real GDP of 1.4%, similar to that of the world\u2019s average. New Zealand is the only region in \nthe  model  that  would  experience  a  real  GDP  increase  in  response  to  the  climate  change-\ninduced global agricultural adjustment.  \n\n7 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 131 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nZhai and Zhuang \n\n  \n  \n\n  \nWorld \nAustralia \nNew Zealand \nJapan \nPRC \nKorea \nSoutheast Asia 6* \nIndia \nRest of South Asia \nCentral Asia \nRest of Asia \nCanada \nUS \nEU \nLatin America \nSub-Sahara Africa \nRest of the world \n\n \n\n-1.4 \n-0.3 \n0.2 \n0 \n-1.3 \n-0.2 \n-1.4 \n-6.2 \n-1.9 \n-1.9 \n-0.4 \n-0.2 \n-0.1 \n-0.2 \n-1.7 \n-2.2 \n-1 \n\nTable 3: Impact on Global Welfare and Production, 2080  \n(% change)  \n\nGDP \n \n\nWelfare \n(EV as % of \nGDP) \n\nTerms of \nTrade \n\n \nCrop \n\nSectoral \nAgriculture \n\nOutput \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \nLivestock \n\n \nProcessed \nfood \n\n \n\n \n\nPaddy rice \n\nWheat \n\nOther grains \n\nOther crops \n\n \n\n \n\n-1.3 \n-0.6 \n1.5 \n-0.2 \n-1.1 \n-0.6 \n-1.7 \n-5.2 \n-2.7 \n-1.5 \n-0.7 \n0.2 \n0 \n0 \n-2.1 \n-3.2 \n-1.2 \n\n  \n\n-0.4 \n2.7 \n-0.4 \n-0.2 \n-0.5 \n-0.4 \n-1.8 \n-4.1 \n1.8 \n-0.4 \n0.8 \n0.4 \n0.4 \n-0.8 \n-1.3 \n-0.5 \n\n \n\n-7.4 \n-42.9 \n140.6 \n1.9 \n-0.1 \n-5.1 \n-17.3 \n-24 \n-19.5 \n49.7 \n-18.4 \n22.1 \n5.1 \n21.4 \n-24.3 \n-29.6 \n-10.1 \n\n-9.1 \n-12.8 \n31.4 \n-4.7 \n-0.5 \n-4.8 \n-16.5 \n-11.5 \n-16 \n12.8 \n-20.8 \n0.9 \n21.3 \n12.9 \n-12.2 \n-23.6 \n-5 \n\n-6.8 \n-66.7 \n38.2 \n6.8 \n4.2 \n0.4 \n-36.3 \n-24.7 \n-29 \n66.9 \n-46.9 \n17.7 \n10.5 \n32 \n-40.5 \n-61.6 \n-16.1 \n\n-7.8 \n-42.5 \n12 \n43.7 \n-0.5 \n-10.6 \n-12.6 \n-36.7 \n-24.6 \n5.1 \n-40.5 \n5.1 \n0.9 \n17 \n-23.4 \n-22.2 \n-13.1 \n\n-7.3 \n-40.6 \n156.2 \n3.5 \n-0.2 \n-5.6 \n-17.9 \n-24.1 \n-19.2 \n48.9 \n-14.3 \n34.6 \n6.9 \n20.7 \n-24.3 \n-31.3 \n-7.9 \n\n-5.9 \n7.1 \n-11 \n0.5 \n-1.9 \n-1.4 \n-1.4 \n-19.1 \n-3.1 \n-10.9 \n1 \n-15.3 \n-7 \n-10.1 \n-2.7 \n-0.8 \n-4.7 \n\n-4.6 \n-0.2 \n-3.8 \n2.2 \n-3.6 \n-0.4 \n-4.5 \n-29.1 \n-10.8 \n-0.5 \n-5.2 \n-1.6 \n-0.3 \n3.6 \n-5.2 \n-4.3 \n-2.1 \n\n*Including Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam. \n\nSource: CGE model simulation results. \n\n 8\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 131 \n \n\n \n\n  Zhai and Zhuang \n\nAggregate  welfare  effects,  which  were  measured  by  the  sum  of  equivalent  variation  of  the \nhouseholds  and  real  investment,  generally  followed  the  changes  in  real  GDP.  However, \ninternational price adjustment played a role in determining the distribution of global welfare \nlosses.  After  incorporating  agricultural  damage,  international  prices  of  crop  products  were \nexpected  to  increase  by  16\u201322%  relative  to  the  price  of  manufacturing  exports  of  high-\nincome  countries,  reflecting  the  inelastic  demand  structure  of  agricultural  products  (Figure \n1). The resulting changes in terms of trade would benefit net agricultural exporting countries, \nbut damage net agricultural importing countries. As shown in the second column of Table 3, \nNew  Zealand\u2019s  welfare  gained  as  much  as  1.5%  of  GDP,  much  higher  than  its  GDP \nexpansion,  due  to  its  improved  terms  of  trade.  In  Canada  and  the  European  Union  (EU), \nimprovements  in  terms  of  trade  more  than  offset  the  direct  losses  from  agricultural \nproductivity  reduction,  leading  to  slight  welfare  gains.  Central  Asia  would  benefit  from \nchanges in terms of trade. However, for other regions the deterioration of their terms of trade \nwould  amplify  the  effects  of  agricultural  damage.  Generally,  the  resulting  welfare  losses \nwould be larger than GDP decline.  \n\nFigure 1: Impacts of Climate Change on International Prices and  \nWorld Trade of Agricultural Goods, 2080  \n\nInternational prices*\n\nWorld trade volume\n\ne\nn\n\ni\nl\n\ne\ns\na\nb\n \no\nt\n \ne\nv\ni\nt\na\ne\nr\n \ne\ng\nn\na\nh\nc\n \n%\n\nl\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n-15\n\nPaddy rice\n\nWheat\n\nOther grains\n\nOther crops\n\nLivestock\n\nProcessed food\n\n \n\n*Prices are deflated by price index to manufacturing exports of high income countries. \n\nThe  detailed  world  agricultural  production  simulation  results  suggest  that  global  crop \nproduction would shrink by 7.4% by 2080, which is less than half of Cline\u2019s estimate. This is \npartly  due  to  the  declining  weight  of  developing  countries,  which  would  be  more  adversely \nimpacted by climate change than developed countries, in global agricultural production over \n2004\u20132080.  In  Cline\u2019s  original  estimate,  agricultural  output  values  in  2003  were  used  as \nweights to obtain the estimate for global impact. The reallocation of resources across sectors \nalso partially offset the direct impact of agricultural productivity slowdown, contributing to the \nsmaller magnitude of crops output contraction. In regions where the impacts on agricultural \nproductivity are small or positive, crop production would expand. New Zealand\u2019s crop output \nwould  increase  the  most,  by  141%,  because  of  its  higher  agricultural  productivity  under \nclimate change and relatively small crop share in its economy. Central Asia, the EU, US, and \nJapan,  would  see  crop  production  rise  by  5\u201350%  in  response  to  the  crop  price  hikes.  In \ngeneral, the crop production expansion would come at the expense of the livestock sector, \nwith land and other production resources being diverted toward crops sectors. \n\n 9\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 131 \n \n\n \n\nZhai and Zhuang \n\nCrop  production  in  South  Asia,  Latin  America  and  Sub-Sahara  Africa  would  be  the  most \nadversely affected by climate change. The decline of crop output in Southeast Asia would be \nmore moderate, but still significant at 17.3% by 2080. The negative impact of climate change \non  crop  production  in  East  Asian  countries  would  be  modest,  ranging  from  0.1%  for  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and 5.1% for the Republic of Korea. \n\nAs downstream sectors of crop agriculture, the  production  of livestock  and processed food \nwould  also  decline  with  rising  input  costs.  World  output  of  livestock  and  processed  food \nwould  shrink  by  5.9%  and  4.6%,  respectively.  Again,  cross-region  variation  exists.  The \nproduction of these two sectors would drop significantly in India, but rise in Japan. Australia \nand the EU would also see output expansion of livestock and processed food, respectively, \nreflecting  their  stronger  comparative  advantage  in  these  products  as  a  result  of  climate \nchange.  The  shifting  comparative  advantage  induced  by  climate  change  would  have \nimportant  implications  for  international  patterns  in  agricultural  commodities.  Global  trade  in \ncrop  agriculture  would  increase,  but  trade  in  livestock  and  processed  food  would  shrink \n(Figure 1).  \n\n4.2  Impacts on Southeast Asian Countries \n\nTable  4  reports  the  macroeconomic  effects  of  the  projected  slowdown  in  agricultural \nproductivity on six Southeast Asian countries. It is not surprising that the impact on real GDP \nwas very modest for Singapore, given the small agricultural sector in its economy. However, \nthe  GDP  contractions  in  Thailand,  Viet  Nam,  and  the  Philippines  were  much  more \nsignificant, ranging from 1.7% to 2.4%. The welfare losses were generally larger than GDP \nreductions,  except  for  Viet  Nam,  which  would  experience  a  slight  improvement  in  terms  of \ntrade. Both consumption and investment would decline compared to the baseline scenario. \nThe  incorporation  of  agricultural  productivity  damage  would  hamper  agricultural  exports  of \nSoutheast Asian countries, leading to a reduction of their aggregate exports. Consequently, \naggregate imports would also decline to maintain the current account balance.  \n\nTable 4: Macro-economic Impacts of Climate Change on Southeast Countries, 2080  \n(% change)  \n\n  \nReal GDP \nWelfare (EV as % of GDP) \nTerms of Trade \nConsumption \nInvestment  \nExports \nImports \nFactor prices \n Capital \n\nUnskilled labor \nSkilled labor \nLand \n\nIndonesia \n\nMalaysia  Philippines \n\nSingapore  Thailand \n\nViet Nam \n\n-1.4 \n-1.7 \n-0.5 \n-1.9 \n-0.9 \n-0.9 \n-1.4 \n \n-2 \n-1.5 \n-2.8 \n9.6 \n\n-0.9 \n-1.6 \n-0.7 \n-1.8 \n-2.2 \n-0.7 \n-1.5 \n \n0.3 \n-1.6 \n-1.8 \n4.9 \n\n-1.7 \n-1.9 \n-0.9 \n-2.5 \n-2.4 \n-0.7 \n-1.6 \n \n0.2 \n-2 \n-2.6 \n0.9 \n\n-0.3 \n-0.7 \n-0.2 \n-0.8 \n-0.8 \n0 \n-0.3 \n \n-0.2 \n-1 \n-1.2 \n-8.7 \n\n-2.4 \n-2.7 \n-0.3 \n-3 \n-2.5 \n-2.5 \n-2.7 \n \n-0.9 \n-4 \n-3.3 \n-4.3 \n\n-1.7 \n-1.2 \n0.1 \n-1.9 \n-0.9 \n-1.7 \n-1.5 \n \n-1.5 \n-1.6 \n-2.3 \n3.9 \n\nSource: CGE model simulations. \n\nTo  get  a  sense  of  the  contribution  of  agricultural  production  slowdown  in  other  regions  to \nwelfare  losses  in  Southeast  Asia,  we  ran  two  additional  scenarios  in  which  the  climate \nchange-induced  agricultural  productivity  shocks  were  applied  to  Southeast  Asia  and  other \nregions separately. The welfare effects of these two scenarios are presented in Figure 2. It is \nclear that that domestic productivity reduction would be the major source of welfare losses of \nIndonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Actually, Indonesia, Thailand, and Viet Nam \nwould  benefit  slightly  from  the  agricultural  production  contraction  in  rest  of  the  world. \nHowever, in Malaysia and Singapore the shocks from rest of the world would dominate total \n\n10 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 131 \n \n\n \n\nZhai and Zhuang \n\nwelfare  effects  because  of  their  small  agricultural  sectors  and  their  high  dependence  on \nimports for agricultural supply. \n\nFigure 2: Decomposition of Welfare Impacts, 2080  \n\nP\nD\nG\ne\nn\n\n \n\ni\nl\n\ne\ns\na\nb\n\n \nf\n\n \n\no\n%\n \ns\na\n\n \n)\n\nV\nE\n\n(\n \ne\ng\nn\na\nh\nc\n \ne\nr\na\n\nf\nl\n\ne\nW\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n-0.5\n\n-1.0\n\n-1.5\n\n-2.0\n\n-2.5\n\n-3.0\n\n-3.5\n\nIndonesia\n\nMalaysia\n\nPhilippines\n\nSingapore\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\nGlobal crop productivity reduction\nReduction of crop productivity in Southeast Asia only\n\nReduction of crop productivity in non-Southeast Asian regions\n\n \nThe pattern of changes in production factor gains and losses is specific to each country. In \ngeneral, following negative agricultural productivity shocks, the average return to agricultural \nfactors of production would rise relative to non-agricultural production factors, because of the \ninelastic  demand  of  agricultural  products.  This  is  evident  from  the  smaller  wage  decline \nreceived by unskilled labor than skilled labor, and the rising rate of return to agricultural land \nin  most  Southeast  Asian  countries.  Singapore  and  Thailand  are  two  exceptions  with \ndeclining rates of return to land, mainly due to their high use of intermediate crop inputs in \ntheir crop production.  \n\nThe impact on agricultural and food production and trade is shown for each Southeast Asian \ncountry in Table 5. All countries would see output losses in all crops sectors, except for rice \nproduction  in  Malaysia.  Livestock  output  would  increase  in  Thailand  and  Singapore,  partly \nbecause  declining  land  returns  in  the  crops  sectors  would  lead  to  the  conversion  of  some \narable  lands  to  pastures.  The  production  of  the  processed  food  sector  would  expand  in \nMalaysia and Singapore, reflecting their relatively higher efficiency in the use of crop inputs \nin production.  \n\n11 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 131 \n \n\n \n\nZhai and Zhuang \n\nTable 5: Impacts on Agricultural Production and Trade in Southeast Countries, 2080 \n(% change)  \n\nIndonesia \n\nMalaysia  Philippines \n\nSingapore  Thailand \n\nViet Nam \n\n  \nOutput \nCrop agriculture \n Rice \n Other grain \n Other crops \nLivestock  \nProcessed food \nExports \nCrop agriculture \n Rice \n Other grain \n Other crops \nLivestock  \nProcessed food \nImports \nCrop agriculture \n Rice \n Wheat \n Other grain \n Other crops \nLivestock  \nProcessed food \n\n \n-13.4 \n-15 \n-9.9 \n-13.4 \n-4.4 \n-6.4 \n \n-25.3 \n-17.1 \n-39.9 \n-25.1 \n1.9 \n-7.3 \n \n8.7 \n15 \n-2.7 \n30.8 \n13.6 \n-9.9 \n-13.6 \n\n \n-13.4 \n1.6 \n-52.6 \n-31.1 \n-2.6 \n5.5 \n \n-49.2 \n-51.2 \n-74.6 \n-49.1 \n21.9 \n4.8 \n \n4.7 \n50.6 \n15.6 \n3.3 \n3.2 \n-16.4 \n-14 \n\n \n-22.5 \n-11.9 \n-13 \n-25.6 \n-0.3 \n-4.2 \n \n-56.7 \n-73.2 \n-48.8 \n-56.7 \n57.5 \n-7.4 \n \n24.3 \n34.1 \n17.7 \n42.8 \n34.1 \n-25.2 \n-12.4 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n-47.6 \n\n-47.6 \n105.1 \n12.7 \n \n-49.2 \n\n-49.2 \n117.6 \n13.8 \n \n-0.4 \n1.5 \n2.2 \n7.4 \n-0.6 \n-4.2 \n-1.9 \n\n \n-29.4 \n-36.3 \n-26.5 \n-27.4 \n12.6 \n-0.9 \n \n-59.4 \n-41.5 \n-58.2 \n-60.3 \n82.1 \n-1 \n \n11.9 \n13.9 \n4 \n69 \n12.1 \n-24.3 \n-16.1 \n\n \n-11.1 \n-13.6 \n-0.1 \n-7.4 \n-5 \n-14.2 \n \n10.3 \n46.8 \n-11.2 \n9.8 \n20.6 \n-21.6 \n \n-9.3 \n32.8 \n-15.3 \n-27.6 \n-6.8 \n-12.2 \n-16.7 \n\nSource: CGE model simulations  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAs  a  result  of  the  rising  producer  prices  relative  to  other  regions  in  the  world,  the  crop \nexports  would  shrink  significantly  for  all  Southeast  Asian  countries  except  Viet  Nam.  Viet \nNam would experience export expansion in rice and other crop products due to its stronger \ncomparative  advantage  in crop  production  and  smaller  reduction  in  agricultural  productivity \nrelative to other Southeast Asia countries. Similarly, the imports of crop agricultural products \nwould  rise  for  Southeast  Asian  economies.  As  a  consequence,  the  import  dependence  of \nSoutheast Asia\u2019s crops sector in 2080 would rise from 23.3% of baseline to 25.8% under the \nclimate  change  scenario.  Southeast  Asia\u2019s  grain  self-sufficiency  ratio  in  2080  would \ndecrease by 2.4 percentage points to 84.1% (Figures 3 and 4).  \n\n12 \n\n\f27\n\n25\n\n23\n\n21\n\n19\n\n17\n\n15\n\n92\n\n91\n\n90\n\n89\n\n88\n\n87\n\n86\n\n85\n\n84\n\n83\n\n82\n\nADBI Working Paper 131 \n \n\n \n\nZhai and Zhuang \n\nFigure 3: Import Dependence of Crop Agriculture, 2010\u201380  \n\nCrop imports as % of domestic demand, Southeast Asia\n\nBaseline\n\nScenario with agricultural productivity losses\n\n2010\n\n2020\n\n2030\n\n2040\n\n2050\n\n2060\n\n2070\n\n2080\n\nFigure 4: Grain Self-sufficiency Ratio, 2010\u201380  \n\nGrain output as % of domestic demand, Southeast Asia\n\nBaseline\n\nScenario with agricultural productivity losses\n\n2010\n\n2020\n\n2030\n\n2040\n\n2050\n\n2060\n\n2070\n\n2080\n\n4.3  Sensitivity to the Assumption About Baseline Agricultural \n\nProductivity Growth  \n\nIn the baseline scenario, agricultural productivity was assumed to grow at the same rate as \nthe  manufacturing  and  services  sectors.  However,  in  recent  decades,  there  has  been \nsignificant  slowdown  in  agricultural  technological  progress.  In  the  1960s  and  1970s,  world \ngrain yields rose at an annual rate of 2.7%. This rate has slowed to 1.6% in the past quarter \ncentury.  The  languishing  agricultural  productivity  growth  is  especially  evident  in  Southeast \nAsia. A recent global estimate of agricultural productivity by Ludena et al. (2007) shows that \ntotal  factor  productivity  (TFP)  growth  rates  in  the  crops  sector  in  East  and  Southeast  Asia \nhave lowered from 0.99% in 1970s to -0.67% in 1980s and -0.48% in 1990s. This negative \nproductivity  growth  pattern  is  expected  to  continue  for  the  next  two  decades  as  a  result  of \nlow  levels  of  expenditure  on  research  and  development.  For  example,  Anderson,  Pardey, \n\n13 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 131 \n \n\n \n\nZhai and Zhuang \n\nand Roseboom (1994) report an agricultural research intensity (research expenditures as a \nshare of agricultural GDP) for the Asia and Pacific region outside of the PRC and India in the \nearly 1980s of 0.32. This is about one sixth the research intensity in developed countries and \nonly half that in Sub-Saharan Africa (Hertel et al. 2008). \n\nGiven  the  considerable  downside  uncertainty  to  our  assumed  baseline  agricultural \nproductivity  growth for  Southeast  Asia, we developed  an  alternative  baseline  scenario  with \nslower  productivity  growth  in  Southeast  Asia\u2019s  agricultural  sectors\u2014specifically,  one \npercentage  point  lower  on  annual  average  than  the  original  baseline,  thereupon  repeating \nthe scenario of incorporating agricultural damages. The key simulation results are presented \nin  Table  6.  Since  the  results  for  non-Southeast  Asia  regions  are  little  changed  from  our \noriginal  results,  only  revised  results  on  GDP  and  welfare  of  Southeast  Asian  countries  are \nreported. \n\nTable 6: Impacts of Climate Change under  \nAlternative Assumption about Baseline Agricultural Productivity Growth, 2080  \n(% change relative to alternative baseline) \n\n  \n\nReal GDP \n\nSoutheast Asia \nIndonesia \nMalaysia \n  Philippines \n  Singapore \n  Thailand \n\nViet Nam \n\nSource: CGE model simulations. \n\nWelfare (EV as % of \nGDP) \n-2 \n-2.4 \n-1.8 \n-2.4 \n-0.7 \n-2.8 \n-1.4 \n\n-1.3 \n-1.5 \n-1 \n-1.7 \n-0.3 \n-2 \n-0.9 \n\nBecause  of  the  slower  agricultural  productivity  growth  in  Southeast  Asia,  its  agricultural \nshare  of  GDP  in  2080  was  smaller  under  the  alternative  baseline  in  comparison  with  the \noriginal baseline. This lead to more muted impacts on aggregate output, as shown in the first \ncolumn of Table 6. However, because long-term agricultural import dependence was larger \nas a  result  of slower  agricultural  productivity  improvement  in  the  alternative  baseline,  most \nSoutheast Asian economies were more vulnerable to the rise in world prices of agricultural \nproducts.  Southeast  Asian  economies\u2019  losses  in  terms  of  trade,  and  thusly  welfare,  were \ngenerally  larger.  Therefore,  the  results  from  the  alternative  simulations  suggested  that \nagricultural  technological  progress  would  be  important  for  Southeast  Asia  to  cope  with  the \npotential risks from global climate change.  \n\n5.  CONCLUSIONS  \n\nClimate change is an increasingly significant global challenge and its negative impacts have \nbeen  already  felt  in  some  regions  of  the  world.  This  paper  uses  a  global  CGE  model  to \nassess  the  long  term  economic  effects  of  climate  change.  The  results  suggest  that  the \naggregate  impacts  of  agricultural  damages  caused  by  climate  change  on  the  global \neconomy  are  moderate.  However,  the  impacts  are  not  evenly  distributed  across  the  world. \nDeveloping  countries  would  bear  disproportionately  large  losses  arising  from  climate \nchange.  Some  significant  adjustments  in  global  agricultural  production  and  trade,  and \nconsequently the distribution of income, may be accompanied by the changes of climate.  \n\nSoutheast Asia is an important agricultural producer and consumer and plays a major role in \nthe world market via several agricultural products. With the anticipated decline in agriculture \nshare  of  GDP,  the  aggregate  output  losses  from  climate  change-related  agricultural \nproductivity reduction would be modest for most Southeast Asian countries. However, import \ndependence  on  crop  products  would  rise  for  Southeast  Asia  in  the  coming  decades.  This \nincreasing exposure  to  world  agricultural  markets  would  make  Southeast  Asian economies \n\n14 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 131 \n \n\n \n\nZhai and Zhuang \n\nsuffer  more  welfare  losses  through  the  deterioration  of  terms  of  trade.  This  effect  is \nespecially significant for Malaysia and Singapore.  \n\nIt is important to mention that there are great uncertainties in both the scientific projections \nand technical, social, and economic prospects. Therefore the results presented in this paper \nare  only  illustrative.  Their  purpose  is  to  provide  insights  on  the  direction  and  order  of \nmagnitude  of  the  potential  medium-  and  long-term  impacts,  and  reveal  some  key  potential \ndriving forces in determining these impacts. They do not represent forecasts for the future. \n\nOne  major  uncertainty  is  the  technological  progress  in  agriculture.  Agricultural  productivity \ngrowth  has  been, and  will  remain  to be,  the  most  important  line  of  defense  for  global  food \nsecurity.  However,  in  the  past  two  decades,  productivity  gains  from  the  Green  Revolution \nhave shown signs of being exhausted. If the rising demand of agricultural products, driven by \npopulation  and  income  growth,  runs  a close  race  with  technological  progress  in  the  future, \nthe  impacts  of  agricultural  damage  arising  from  climate  change  could  be  substantial \n(Zilberman et al. 2004; Cline 2007). This is especially pronounced in Southeast Asia, where \nproductivity growth in the crop sector has been negative since 1980. Reversing this trend of \ndeclining  agricultural  productivity  would  be  an  important  component  for  a  Southeast  Asian \nstrategy to cope with the potential risks from the expected changes in climate. \n\n15 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 131 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\nZhai and Zhuang \n\nAdams, R.
