INTRODUCTION \nRecent scientific research has concluded that the increased atmospheric concentration of \ngreenhouse gases will have significant impacts on the Earth\u2019s climate in the coming decades. \nAssuming no emission control policies, the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change \n(IPCC)  predicted  that  average  global  surface  temperatures  will  increase  by  2.8\u00baC  on \naverage during this century, with best-guess increases ranging from 1.8 and 4.0\u00baC (IPCC \n2007a). Global warming would alter natural climate and environmental systems in many \nways, leading to an increased frequency of extreme weather events, rising sea levels, a \nreversal of ocean currents, and changes in precipitation patterns. These changes could \nimpact social-economic activities, with serious implications for the well being of humans long \ninto the future.  \nAgriculture is one of the most vulnerable sectors to the anticipated climate change. Despite \nthe technological advances in the second half of 20th century, including the Green Revolution, \nweather and climate are still key factors in determining agricultural productivity in most areas \nof the world. The predicted changes in temperatures and rainfall patterns, as well as their \nassociated impacts on water availability, pests, disease, and extreme weather events are all \nlikely  to  affect  substantially  the  potential  of  agricultural  production.  Literature  on  the \neconomics of climate change suggests that although global crop production may be boosted \nslightly by global warming in the short term (before 2030), it will ultimately turn negative over \nthe longer term (Bruinsma 2003; IPCC 2007b). Moreover, the impact of climate change on \nagricultural production is unlikely to be evenly distributed across regions. Low latitude and \ndeveloping countries are expected to suffer more from the agricultural effects of global \nwarming, reflecting their disadvantaged geographic location, greater agricultural share in \ntheir economies, and limited ability to adapt to climate change. In contrast, crop production in \nhigh  latitude  regions  will  generally  benefit  from  climate  change.  In  a  recent  global \ncomprehensive  estimate  for  over  100  countries,  Cline  (2007)  predicted  that  global \nagricultural  productivity  would  fall  by  15.9%  in  the  2080s  if  global  warming  continues \nunabated,  with  developing  countries  experiencing  a  disproportionately  larger  decline  of \n19.7%. \nAgriculture plays an important role in Southeast Asia, contributing to more than 10% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) in most regional economies, and providing jobs for over one third of \nthe working population in the region. As is the case in other developing regions of the world, \nnearly three fourths of the poor in Southeast Asia reside in rural areas, and a large majority \nof them are dependent on agriculture. Consequently, agricultural development has important \nimplications  for  the  reduction  of  poverty  in  Southeast  Asia.  Moreover,  the  increased \nexposure of Southeast Asia\u2019s agriculture sector to international trade means that any climate \nchange-related  shocks  in  international  markets  for  agricultural  products  will  be  easily \ntransmitted to the region through trade channels.  \nThis paper used a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the global \neconomy to investigate the potential impacts of climate change on agriculture and the world \neconomy, with a special focus on Southeast Asia. The CGE model is an economy-wide \nmodel that elucidates interactions among industries, consumers and governments across \nthe global economy. The detailed region and sector disaggregation of the model makes it \npossible  to  capture  the  spillover  effects  of  sector-  or  country-specific  shocks.  Climate \nchanges impact an economy directly through the effects on that economy\u2019s agricultural \noutputs and indirectly through changes in the agricultural production of other countries. We \nestablished this distinction by comparing the scenario of agricultural productivity shrinkage in \nSoutheast Asia to the scenario of agricultural productivity shrinkage in the rest of the world. \nThe role of productivity growth in adapting to the climate change was also examined. \nSection 2 of this paper discusses the relationship between climate change and agricultural \nproduction by reviewing the existing literature in which various modeling approaches have \n1 ", "ADBI Working Paper 131    Zhai and Zhuang \n \nbeen employed to estimate the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity. We \nthen describe the specifications of the CGE model used in this study in Section 3. Section 4 \nassesses the impacts of climate change-induced global agricultural productivity decline on \nagricultural production, trade and macro-economy. The final section offers conclusions. \n2.  CLIMATE CHANGE AND AGRICULTURE \nClimate can affect agriculture in a variety of ways. Temperature, radiation, rainfall, soil \nmoisture and carbon dioxide (CO ) concentration are all important variables to determine \n2\nagricultural  productivity,  and  their  relationships  are  not  simply  linear.  Current  research \nconfirms that there are thresholds for these climate variables above which crop yields \ndecline (Challinor et al. 2005; Proter and Semenov 2005). For example, the  modeling \nstudies discussed in recent IPCC reports indicate that moderate to medium increases in \nmean temperature (1\u20133\u00baC), along with associated CO  increases and rainfall changes, are \n2\nexpected to benefit crop yields  in  temperate regions.  However,  in low-latitude regions, \nmoderate temperature increases (1\u20132\u00baC) are likely to have negative yield impacts for major \ncereals. Warming of more than 3\u00baC would have negative impacts in all regions (IPCC \n2007b). \nThe interaction of temperature increases and changing rainfall patterns determines the \nimpact of climate change on soil moisture. With rising temperatures, both evaporation and \nprecipitation are expected to increase. The resulting net effect on water availability would \ndepend on which force is more dominant. The IPCC reports project that by the middle of the \n21st century, water availability will increase as a result of climate change at high latitudes and \nin some wet tropical areas, and decrease over some dry regions at mid-latitudes and in the \ndry tropics (IPCC 2007b). Some regions that are already drought-prone may suffer more \nsevere dry periods.  \nIncreases in atmospheric CO  concentration can have a positive impact on crops yields by \n2\nstimulating plant photosynthesis and reducing the water loss via plant respiration. This \ncarbon fertilization effect is strong for so-called C3 crops,1 such as rice, wheat, soybeans, \nfine grains, legumes, and most trees, which have a lower rate of photosynthetic efficiency. \nFor C4 crops like maize, millet, sorghum, sugarcane, and many grasses, these effects are \nmuch smaller. Other factors such as a plant\u2019s growth stage, or the application of water and \nnitrogen, can also impact the effect of elevated CO  on plant yield. Recent research based \n2\non experiments with the free air concentration enrichment method suggests a much smaller \nCO  fertilization effect on yield for C3 crops and little or no stimulation for C4 crops, in \n2\ncomparison with past estimates from studies conducted under enclosed test conditions \n(Long et al. 2005, 2006). Based on analysis of recent data, the IPCC reports suggest that \nyields may increase by 10\u201325% for C3 crops and by 0\u201310% for C4 crops when CO  levels \n2\nreach 550ppm (IPCC 2007b). However, as a number of limiting factors were not included in \nthe  modeling  and  experiment  analysis,  considerable  uncertainties  still  surround  the \nestimates of carbon fertilization effect. \nBesides temperature and carbon concentration, some other ecological changes brought on \nby global warming will have an impact on agriculture. For example, the patterns of pests and \ndiseases may change with climate change, leading to reductions in agricultural production. \nMoreover, agricultural productivity will be depressed by increased climate variability and \nincreased intensity and frequency of extreme events such a drought and floods. These \nfactors further contribute to the difficulties in estimating the impacts of climate change on \nagricultural productivity. \n                                                 \n1 Crops are generally divided into two groups, C3 and C4, depending on their efficiency of use of CO  during \n2\nphotosynthesis.  \n2 ", "ADBI Working Paper 131    Zhai and Zhuang \n \nQuantitative estimates of the agricultural impact of climate change have predominantly relied \non three approaches: crop simulation models, agro-ecological zone (AEZ) models, and \ncross-section (Ricardian) models. Crop simulation models draw on controlled experiments \nwhere crops are grown in field or laboratory settings simulating different climates and levels \nof CO  in order to estimate yield responses of a specific crop variety to certain climates, and \n2\nother variables of interest.2 These models do not include farmer adaptation to changing \nclimate  conditions  in  the  estimates.  Consequently,  their  results  tend  to  overstate  the \ndamages of climate change to agricultural production (Mendelsohn and Dinar 1999). The \nsecond approach, AEZ analysis, combines crop simulation models with land management \ndecision analysis, and captures the changes in agro-climatic resources (Darwin et al. 1995; \nFishcher et al. 2005). AEZ analysis categorizes existing lands by agro-ecological zones, \nwhich differ in the length of growing period and climatic zone. The length of growing period is \ndefined  based  on  temperature,  precipitation,  soil  characteristics,  and  topography.  The \nchanges of the distribution of the crop zones along with climate change are tracked in AEZ \nmodels. Crop modeling and environmental matching procedures are used to identify crop-\nspecific environmental limitations under various levels of inputs and management conditions, \nand provide estimates of the maximum agronomically attainable crops yields for a given land \nresources unit. However, as the predicted potential attainable yields from AEZ models are \noften much larger than current actual yields, the models may overestimate the effects of \nautonomous adaptation. Cline (2007) observed that AEZ studies tend to attribute excessive \nbenefits to the warming of cold high-latitude regions, thereby overstating global gains from \nclimate changes.  \nThe  Ricardian  cross-sectional  approach  explores  the  relationship  between  agricultural \ncapacity  (measured  by  land  value)  and  climate  variables  (usually  temperature  and \nprecipitation) on the basis of statistical estimates from farm survey or country-level data. This \napproach automatically incorporates efficient climate change adaptations by farmers. The \nmajor criticisms of the Ricardian approach are its ignorance of price changes and that it fails \nto fully control for the impact of other variables that affect farm incomes (Mendelsohn and \nDinar 1999; Cline 1996).  \nCline (2007) used both Ricardian statistical models and crop models to develop a set of \nconsensus agricultural impact estimates through the 2080s for over 100 countries. He first \ndeveloped geographically detailed projections for changes in temperature and precipitation \nthrough the 2080s based on a baseline emission projection from the IPCC\u2019s Emission \nScenarios. Next, these climatic change projections were applied to the agricultural impact \nmodels  to  assess  the  effects  of  climate  change  on  agricultural  productivity.  The  final \nconsensus estimates were the weighted average of the Ricardian estimates and the crops \nmodel estimates. Table 1 presents the major results of Cline\u2019s estimates. \n                                                 \n2 For more information on crop simulation models, see Adams et al.

Land areas would warm \nmore than oceans, with the average surface temperature increasing by 5.0\u00baC weighting by \nland area and 4.4\u00baC weighting by farming area. By the 2080s, global agricultural productivity \nwould decline by about 3% with carbon fertilization effect and by about 16% if the carbon \nfertilization effect did not materialize. These losses would be disproportionately concentrated \nin developing countries, which would suffer losses of 9% with carbon fertilization effect and \n21% without carbon fertilization effect, in contrast to an 8% gain (with carbon fertilization \neffect) and 6% loss (without carbon fertilization effect) in industrial countries. The detailed \nestimates by country and region reported in Table 2 indicate that South Asia and Africa \nwould be the two regions most harmed by climate change.

THE MODEL  \nThe model used in this study was a dynamic, CGE model of the global economy. It was built \non  the  LINKAGE  model  developed  at  the  World  Bank  (van  der  Mensbrugghe  2005; \nAnderson, Martin, and van der Mensbrugghe 2006), and has its intellectual roots in the \ngroup of multi-country applied general equilibrium models used over the past two decades to \nanalyze the global trade and environmental issues (Shoven and Whalley 1992; Hertel 1997). \nThis section describes the major features of the model.  \nProduction  in  each  economic  sector  was  modeled  using  nested  constant  elasticity  of \nsubstitution (CES) functions and constant returns to scale was assumed. There were three \ntypes  of  production  structures,  depending  on  activities.  Crop  sectors  reflected  the \nsubstitution possibility between extensive and intensive farming. Livestock sectors reflected \nthe substitution possibility between pasture and intensive feeding. All other sectors reflected \nthe standard capital-labor substitution.  \nThe study  assumed differentiation of products by regions of origin; i.e., the Armington \nassumption  (Armington  1969).  Top-level  aggregate  Armington  demand  was  allocated \nbetween goods produced domestically and an aggregate import following a CES function. In \nthe second level, the aggregate import was further disaggregated across the various trade \npartners using an additional CES nest. On the export side, it was assumed that firms treat \ndomestic markets and foreign markets indifferently. Thus the law of one price would hold; \ni.e., the export price was identical to that of domestic supply.  \nIncomes generated from production were assumed to accrue to a single representative \nhousehold in each region. Households maximized utility using An Implicitly Direct Additive \nDemand System (AIDADS) (Rimmer and Powell 1996). AIDADS is a demand system which \nallows the marginal budget shares to vary as a function of total expenditure. Recent work by \nYu et al. (2004) has demonstrated the superiority of AIDADS over other demand systems in \nprojecting  food  demand,  especially  for  long-term  projections  involving  a  wide  range  of \ncountries.  \n5 ", "ADBI Working Paper 131    Zhai and Zhuang \n \nAll commodity and factor markets were assumed to clear through prices. There are five \nprimary factors of production: agricultural land, skilled labor, unskilled labor, capital, and \nnatural resources. Agricultural land and the two types of labor were assumed to be fully \nmobile across sectors within a region. Some adjustment rigidities in capital markets were \nintroduced through the vintage structure of capital, under which the \u201cnew\u201d capital was fully \nmobile across a sector, while \u201cold\u201d capital in a sector could be disinvested only when this \nsector was in decline. In the natural resource sectors of forestry, fishing, and mining, a \nsector-specific factor was introduced into the production function to reflect the resource \nconstraints. These sector-specific factors were modeled using upward sloping supply curves. \nFor other primary factors, stocks were fixed for any given year. The numeraire of the model \nwas defined as the manufactured export index of the high-income countries, which was held \nfixed.  \nThe model was recursive dynamic, beginning with the base year of 2004 and being solved \nannually through 2080. Dynamics of the model were driven by exogenous population and \nlabor growth and technological progress, as well as capital accumulation, which was driven \nby savings. Population and labor force projections were based on the United Nations\u2019 (UN) \nmedium variant forecast. As the UN population forecast covers only 2005\u20132050, the growth \nrates of population and labor forces were assumed to decline exponentially at a rate of 2% \nper  year.  The  household  savings  rate  was  set  as  a function of  economic  growth  and \ndemographic changes, which were drawn from a global cross-country analysis by Bosworth \nand Chodorow-Reich (2006). Technological progress was assumed to be labor-augmented, \nso the model could reach a steady state in the long run. \nThe model was calibrated to the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) version 7, using \ntwenty-one  countries/regions  and  nineteen  sectors.  There  was  a  heavy  emphasis  on \nagriculture and food, which account for ten of the nineteen sectors. Six Southeast Asian \ncountries are explicitly modeled as individual regions in the model.  \n4.  SIMULATIONS AND RESULTS \nA baseline scenario from 2004\u20132080 was constructed under the assumption that there \nwould be no climate change impacts on economic activities. The baseline scenario provided \na reference growth trajectory for examining the effects of climate change-induced agricultural \ndamages.  In  the  baseline,  GDP  growth  up  to  2013  was  exogenous,  derived  from  the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund\u2019s  (IMF)  medium  baseline  projection.  For  each  region,  an \neconomy-wide, labor-augmented productivity grew endogenously over the simulation period \nof 2005\u20132013 to match the pre-specified GDP growth path. After 2013, the productivity \ngrowth rate was held fixed at the level of 2013 up to 2040, and then declined by 1% per year \nafterwards. The supply of agricultural land was assumed to be fixed in high-income countries \nand to grow by 0.12% annually in Asia and 0.2% annually in Latin America, Africa and other \nregions.  \nThe baseline scenario projected a high rate of world economic growth over the next seven \ndecades, with global GDP growing by an average of 3.1% per year over the period of 2010\u2013\n2050, and slowing down to 2.5% per year between 2050 and 2080. The average annual \ngrowth of Southeast Asia over 2010-2080 was 1.1 percentage points higher than that of the \nworld average, and its share in global GDP increased from less than 2% in 2004 to 4.1% in \n2080. Growth was accompanied by rapid structural change in developing countries. The \nshare of agricultural value added, in volume terms, would decline from nearly 10% in 2004 to \n3.8% in 2080 in Southeast Asia. Even though some Asian countries like India and Viet Nam \nhad trade surpluses  in agricultural products  in the base year, they would become net \nimporters  in  the  next  decade  because  of  the  combined  effects  of  economic  growth, \nindustrialization, and land constraints. However, Thailand, the Philippines and Central Asia \nwere expected to maintain surpluses in agricultural trade over the projection period. \n6 ", "ADBI Working Paper 131    Zhai and Zhuang \n \nIn the counterfactual scenario with agricultural damages, it was assumed that productivity in \nfour crop agricultural sectors (paddy rice, wheat, other grains, and other crops) would be \nlower than that in the baseline scenario because of the projected changes in climate. Crop \nproductivity  shocks,  which  were  Cline\u2019s  estimates  without  carbon  fertilization  effect  as \nreported in the first column of Table 2, were imposed gradually over 2009\u20132080. The crop \nproductivity shocks were assumed to be uniform across sectors. The impacts of climate \nchange were assessed by a comparison of the counterfactual scenario with the baseline \nscenario.  \n4.1  Global Impacts  \nTable 3 presents the simulated impacts on global welfare, GDP, and agricultural production, \nwhich are reported as percentage deviation from the \u201cno damage\u201d baseline. The table \nindicates that global real GDP would decline by 1.4% by 2080 as a result of the predicted \nimpacts of climate change on agricultural productivity.

However, \ninternational price adjustment played a role in determining the distribution of global welfare \nlosses. After incorporating agricultural damage, international prices of crop products were \nexpected to increase by 16\u201322% relative to the price of manufacturing exports of high-\nincome countries, reflecting the inelastic demand structure of agricultural products (Figure \n1). The resulting changes in terms of trade would benefit net agricultural exporting countries, \nbut damage net agricultural importing countries. As shown in the second column of Table 3, \nNew  Zealand\u2019s  welfare  gained  as  much  as  1.5%  of  GDP,  much  higher  than  its  GDP \nexpansion, due to its improved terms of trade. In Canada and the European Union (EU), \nimprovements  in  terms  of  trade  more  than  offset  the  direct  losses  from  agricultural \nproductivity  reduction,  leading  to  slight  welfare  gains.  Central  Asia  would  benefit  from \nchanges in terms of trade. However, for other regions the deterioration of their terms of trade \nwould amplify the effects of agricultural damage.

This is \npartly due to the declining weight of developing countries, which would be more adversely \nimpacted by climate change than developed countries, in global agricultural production over \n2004\u20132080. In Cline\u2019s original estimate, agricultural output values in 2003 were used as \nweights to obtain the estimate for global impact. The reallocation of resources across sectors \nalso partially offset the direct impact of agricultural productivity slowdown, contributing to the \nsmaller magnitude of crops output contraction. In regions where the impacts on agricultural \nproductivity are small or positive, crop production would expand. New Zealand\u2019s crop output \nwould increase the most, by 141%, because of its higher agricultural productivity under \nclimate change and relatively small crop share in its economy. Central Asia, the EU, US, and \nJapan, would see crop production rise by 5\u201350% in response to the crop price hikes. In \ngeneral, the crop production expansion would come at the expense of the livestock sector, \nwith land and other production resources being diverted toward crops sectors. \n9 ", "ADBI Working Paper 131    Zhai and Zhuang \n \nCrop production in South Asia, Latin America and Sub-Sahara Africa would be the most \nadversely affected by climate change. The decline of crop output in Southeast Asia would be \nmore moderate, but still significant at 17.3% by 2080. The negative impact of climate change \non crop production in East Asian countries would be modest, ranging from 0.1% for the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and 5.1% for the Republic of Korea. \nAs downstream sectors of crop agriculture, the production of livestock and processed food \nwould also decline with rising input costs. World output of livestock and processed food \nwould shrink by 5.9% and 4.6%, respectively. Again, cross-region variation exists. The \nproduction of these two sectors would drop significantly in India, but rise in Japan. Australia \nand the EU would also see output expansion of livestock and processed food, respectively, \nreflecting their stronger comparative advantage in these products as a result of climate \nchange.  The  shifting  comparative  advantage  induced  by  climate  change  would  have \nimportant implications for international patterns in agricultural commodities. Global trade in \ncrop agriculture would increase, but trade in livestock and processed food would shrink \n(Figure 1).  \n4.2  Impacts on Southeast Asian Countries \nTable  4  reports  the  macroeconomic  effects  of  the  projected  slowdown  in  agricultural \nproductivity on six Southeast Asian countries. It is not surprising that the impact on real GDP \nwas very modest for Singapore, given the small agricultural sector in its economy. However, \nthe  GDP  contractions  in  Thailand,  Viet  Nam,  and  the  Philippines  were  much  more \nsignificant, ranging from 1.7% to 2.4%. The welfare losses were generally larger than GDP \nreductions, except for Viet Nam, which would experience a slight improvement in terms of \ntrade. Both consumption and investment would decline compared to the baseline scenario. \nThe incorporation of agricultural productivity damage would hamper agricultural exports of \nSoutheast Asian countries, leading to a reduction of their aggregate exports. Consequently, \naggregate imports would also decline to maintain the current account balance.  \nTable 4: Macro-economic Impacts of Climate Change on Southeast Countries, 2080  \n(% change)  \n   Indonesia  Malaysia  Philippines  Singapore  Thailand  Viet Nam \nReal GDP  -1.4  -0.9  -1.7  -0.3  -2.4  -1.7 \nWelfare (EV as % of GDP)  -1.7  -1.6  -1.9  -0.7  -2.7  -1.2 \nTerms of Trade  -0.5  -0.7  -0.9  -0.2  -0.3  0.1 \nConsumption  -1.9  -1.8  -2.5  -0.8  -3  -1.9 \nInvestment   -0.9  -2.2  -2.4  -0.8  -2.5  -0.9 \nExports  -0.9  -0.7  -0.7  0  -2.5  -1.7 \nImports  -1.4  -1.5  -1.6  -0.3  -2.7  -1.5 \nFactor prices             \n Capital  -2  0.3  0.2  -0.2  -0.9  -1.5 \nUnskilled labor  -1.5  -1.6  -2  -1  -4  -1.6 \nSkilled labor  -2.8  -1.8  -2.6  -1.2  -3.3  -2.3 \nLand  9.6  4.9  0.9  -8.7  -4.3  3.9 \nSource: CGE model simulations. \nTo get a sense of the contribution of agricultural production slowdown in other regions to \nwelfare losses in Southeast Asia, we ran two additional scenarios in which the climate \nchange-induced agricultural productivity shocks were applied to Southeast Asia and other \nregions separately. The welfare effects of these two scenarios are presented in Figure 2. It is \nclear that that domestic productivity reduction would be the major source of welfare losses of \nIndonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam.

This is evident from the smaller wage decline \nreceived by unskilled labor than skilled labor, and the rising rate of return to agricultural land \nin  most  Southeast  Asian  countries.  Singapore  and  Thailand  are  two  exceptions  with \ndeclining rates of return to land, mainly due to their high use of intermediate crop inputs in \ntheir crop production.  \nThe impact on agricultural and food production and trade is shown for each Southeast Asian \ncountry in Table 5. All countries would see output losses in all crops sectors, except for rice \nproduction in Malaysia. Livestock output would increase in Thailand and Singapore, partly \nbecause declining land returns in the crops sectors would lead to the conversion of some \narable lands to pastures. The production of the processed food sector would expand in \nMalaysia and Singapore, reflecting their relatively higher efficiency in the use of crop inputs \nin production.  \n11 ", "ADBI Working Paper 131    Zhai and Zhuang \n \nTable 5: Impacts on Agricultural Production and Trade in Southeast Countries, 2080 \n(% change)  \n   Indonesia  Malaysia  Philippines  Singapore  Thailand  Viet Nam \nOutput             \nCrop agriculture  -13.4  -13.4  -22.5  -47.6  -29.4  -11.1 \n Rice  -15  1.6  -11.9    -36.3  -13.6 \n Other grain  -9.9  -52.6  -13    -26.5  -0.1 \n Other crops  -13.4  -31.1  -25.6  -47.6  -27.4  -7.4 \nLivestock   -4.4  -2.6  -0.3  105.1  12.6  -5 \nProcessed food  -6.4  5.5  -4.2  12.7  -0.9  -14.2 \nExports             \nCrop agriculture  -25.3  -49.2  -56.7  -49.2  -59.4  10.3 \n Rice  -17.1  -51.2  -73.2    -41.5  46.8 \n Other grain  -39.9  -74.6  -48.8    -58.2  -11.2 \n Other crops  -25.1  -49.1  -56.7  -49.2  -60.3  9.8 \nLivestock   1.9  21.9  57.5  117.6  82.1  20.6 \nProcessed food  -7.3  4.8  -7.4  13.8  -1  -21.6 \nImports             \nCrop agriculture  8.7  4.7  24.3  -0.4  11.9  -9.3 \n Rice  15  50.6  34.1  1.5  13.9  32.8 \n Wheat  -2.7  15.6  17.7  2.2  4  -15.3 \n Other grain  30.8  3.3  42.8  7.4  69  -27.6 \n Other crops  13.6  3.2  34.1  -0.6  12.1  -6.8 \nLivestock   -9.9  -16.4  -25.2  -4.2  -24.3  -12.2 \nProcessed food  -13.6  -14  -12.4  -1.9  -16.1  -16.7 \nSource: CGE model simulations              \nAs a result of the rising producer prices relative to other regions in the world, the crop \nexports would shrink significantly for all Southeast Asian countries except Viet Nam.

Similarly, the imports of crop agricultural products \nwould rise for Southeast Asian economies.

However,  in  recent  decades,  there  has  been \nsignificant slowdown in agricultural technological progress. In the 1960s and 1970s, world \ngrain yields rose at an annual rate of 2.7%. This rate has slowed to 1.6% in the past quarter \ncentury. The languishing agricultural productivity growth is especially evident in Southeast \nAsia. A recent global estimate of agricultural productivity by Ludena et al. (2007) shows that \ntotal factor productivity (TFP) growth rates in the crops sector in East and Southeast Asia \nhave lowered from 0.99% in 1970s to -0.67% in 1980s and -0.48% in 1990s. This negative \nproductivity growth pattern is expected to continue for the next two decades as a result of \nlow levels of expenditure on research and development. For example, Anderson, Pardey, \n13 ", "ADBI Working Paper 131    Zhai and Zhuang \n \nand Roseboom (1994) report an agricultural research intensity (research expenditures as a \nshare of agricultural GDP) for the Asia and Pacific region outside of the PRC and India in the \nearly 1980s of 0.32. This is about one sixth the research intensity in developed countries and \nonly half that in Sub-Saharan Africa (Hertel et al. 2008). \nGiven  the  considerable  downside  uncertainty  to  our  assumed  baseline  agricultural \nproductivity growth for Southeast Asia, we developed an alternative baseline scenario with \nslower  productivity  growth  in  Southeast  Asia\u2019s  agricultural  sectors\u2014specifically,  one \npercentage point lower on annual average than the original baseline, thereupon repeating \nthe scenario of incorporating agricultural damages. The key simulation results are presented \nin Table 6. Since the results for non-Southeast Asia regions are little changed from our \noriginal results, only revised results on GDP and welfare of Southeast Asian countries are \nreported. \nTable 6: Impacts of Climate Change under  \nAlternative Assumption about Baseline Agricultural Productivity Growth, 2080  \n(% change relative to alternative baseline) \n   Real GDP  Welfare (EV as % of \nGDP) \nSoutheast Asia  -1.3  -2 \nIndonesia  -1.5  -2.4 \nMalaysia  -1  -1.8 \n  Philippines  -1.7  -2.4 \n  Singapore  -0.3  -0.7 \n  Thailand  -2  -2.8 \nViet Nam  -0.9  -1.4 \nSource: CGE model simulations. \nBecause of the slower agricultural productivity growth in Southeast Asia, its agricultural \nshare of GDP in 2080 was smaller under the alternative baseline in comparison with the \noriginal baseline. This lead to more muted impacts on aggregate output, as shown in the first \ncolumn of Table 6. However, because long-term agricultural import dependence was larger \nas a result of slower agricultural productivity improvement in the alternative baseline, most \nSoutheast Asian economies were more vulnerable to the rise in world prices of agricultural \nproducts. Southeast Asian economies\u2019 losses in terms of trade, and thusly welfare, were \ngenerally  larger.  Therefore,  the  results  from  the  alternative  simulations  suggested  that \nagricultural technological progress would be important for Southeast Asia to cope with the \npotential risks from global climate change.  \n5.  CONCLUSIONS  \nClimate change is an increasingly significant global challenge and its negative impacts have \nbeen already felt in some regions of the world. This paper uses a global CGE model to \nassess the long term economic effects of climate change. The results suggest that the \naggregate  impacts  of  agricultural  damages  caused  by  climate  change  on  the  global \neconomy are moderate. However, the impacts are not evenly distributed across the world. \nDeveloping  countries  would  bear  disproportionately  large  losses  arising  from  climate \nchange.  Some  significant  adjustments  in  global  agricultural  production  and  trade,  and \nconsequently the distribution of income, may be accompanied by the changes of climate.  \nSoutheast Asia is an important agricultural producer and consumer and plays a major role in \nthe world market via several agricultural products. With the anticipated decline in agriculture \nshare  of  GDP,  the  aggregate  output  losses  from  climate  change-related  agricultural \nproductivity reduction would be modest for most Southeast Asian countries. However, import \ndependence on crop products would rise for Southeast Asia in the coming decades. This \nincreasing exposure to world agricultural markets would make Southeast Asian economies \n14 ", "ADBI Working Paper 131    Zhai and Zhuang \n \nsuffer  more  welfare  losses  through  the  deterioration  of  terms  of  trade.  This  effect  is \nespecially significant for Malaysia and Singapore.  \nIt is important to mention that there are great uncertainties in both the scientific projections \nand technical, social, and economic prospects. Therefore the results presented in this paper \nare only illustrative. Their purpose is to provide insights on the direction and order of \nmagnitude of the potential medium- and long-term impacts, and reveal some key potential \ndriving forces in determining these impacts. They do not represent forecasts for the future. \nOne major uncertainty is the technological progress in agriculture. Agricultural productivity \ngrowth has been, and will remain to be, the most important line of defense for global food \nsecurity. However, in the past two decades, productivity gains from the Green Revolution \nhave shown signs of being exhausted. If the rising demand of agricultural products, driven by \npopulation and income growth, runs a close race with technological progress in the future, \nthe  impacts  of  agricultural  damage  arising  from  climate  change  could  be  substantial \n(Zilberman et al. 2004; Cline 2007). This is especially pronounced in Southeast Asia, where \nproductivity growth in the crop sector has been negative since 1980. Reversing this trend of \ndeclining agricultural productivity would be an important component for a Southeast Asian \nstrategy to cope with the potential risks from the expected changes in climate. \n15 ", "ADBI Working Paper 131    Zhai and Zhuang \n \nREFERENCES \nAdams, R.
