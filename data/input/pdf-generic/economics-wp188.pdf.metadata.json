Remittances \nhave become the single most important source of foreign exchange to the \neconomy and a significant source of income for recipient families. Using the \ninstrument variable estimation technique, this study examines the role of \nremittances in increasing household consumption and investment and thereby \ntheir potential for rebalancing economic growth and creating long-term human \nand capital investment. The results indicate that remittances negatively influence \nthe share of food consumption in the total expenditure. However, unlike previous \nstudies, the estimations show that remittances to the Philippines do not have \na significant influence on other key items of consumption or investment such \nas spending on education and health care. A further analysis using logistical \nregression shows that remittances help to lift households out of poverty. \nRemittances thus may help in fighting poverty in the Philippines but not in \nrebalancing growth, especially in the long run.\n\n\f\fI. Introduction\n\nMigrant remittances transferred to families in home countries directly become part \nof household budgets that can be spent on basic needs, serve as extra funds either \nfor increasing consumption of durable and nondurable goods, or used for savings. \nRemittances may also serve as capital for starting businesses. Thus, such overseas \ncash flows raise the standard of living of recipient families. As one of the world\u2019s largest \nrecipients of remittances, the Philippines received roughly 12% of its gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) through this channel in 2008. These flows have become the single most \nimportant source of foreign exchange to the economy (Figure 1) and a significant source \nof income for recipient families. Out of the households that received remittances in \nthird quarter of 2009, 93% spent part of it for food and other household needs, 72% for \neducation, and 63% for medical expenses (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas 2009). While \nremittances shielded the economy during crisis situations in the past, the current global \neconomic crisis has brought a new challenge to the role of remittances. The 1997 crisis \nmainly affected the Asian region while the current one is affecting countries all over the \nworld, including those sending remittances. Weak global demand for goods and services \nand slower economic growth, along with consequent rise in unemployment in host \ncountries, has put the demand for Filipino workers and their remittance transfers at risk. \n\nFigure 1: Sources of Foreign Exchange for the Philippines (as percent of GDP)\n\n15\n\n13\n\n11\n\n9\n\n7\n\n5\n\n3\n\n1\n\n-1\n\n-3\n\n8\n8\n9\n1\n\n9\n8\n9\n1\n\n0\n9\n9\n1\n\n1\n9\n9\n1\n\n2\n9\n9\n1\n\n3\n9\n9\n1\n\n4\n9\n9\n1\n\n5\n9\n9\n1\n\n6\n9\n9\n1\n\n7\n9\n9\n1\n\n8\n9\n9\n1\n\n9\n9\n9\n1\n\n0\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\n0\n0\n2\n\n2\n0\n0\n2\n\n3\n0\n0\n2\n\n4\n0\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\n6\n0\n0\n2\n\n7\n0\n0\n2\n\nPortfolio investments \nForeign direct investments \nNet development flows \nOFW remittance \nGross domestic saving \n\nSource:   Authors\u2019 estimate using data from Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (2009).\n\n\f\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 188\n\nCurrently almost 10% of the Philippine population lives outside the country\u2014as observed \nat any given time in the last decade (estimates by the Commission on Filipinos Overseas, \nvarious years). This has led to an influx of remittances that have helped support domestic \nproduction and consumption, and have pushed foreign exchange reserves to an all-time \nhigh of US$38 billion at the end of 2008. For a country previously saddled by \u201cfiscal \ndeficits, external debts, trade imbalances and few foreign direct investments\u201d (Pernia \n2008, 6), remittances have helped finance domestic and foreign needs without negatively \naffecting the foreign exchange reserves. \n\nThe Asian financial crisis in 1997 weakened remittance inflow from 1998 to 2001 \n(Figure 2). However, the current crisis weakens global demand for goods and services \nand places demand for Filipino labor at risk, leading to lower remittance inflows.  With \nalmost a generation of Filipinos now fully adapted to a remittance-fed economy, \nsuch a scenario does not look positive. In this context, this paper analyzes the role \nof remittances in augmenting household consumption, investments, and therefore in \nrebalancing growth. The paper will also look at the role of remittance in reducing poverty \nincidence.\n\nFigure 2: Total Overseas Migrants and Remittances in the Philippines\n\n18\n\n16\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n140,000\n\n120,000\n\n100,000\n\n80,000\n\n60,000\n\n40,000\n\n20,000\n\n0\n\nAsian\ncrisis\n\n1988\n\n1989\n\n1990\n\n1991\n\n1992\n\n1993\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1997\n\n1998\n\n1999\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\nTotal OFWs deployed\nOFW remittance (US dollar billions)\n\nSource:   Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas website, available:www.bsp.gov.ph, downloaded 10 September 2009.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses the sources \nand pattern of remittances based on migration patterns. Section III presents a review of \nliterature on the effects of remittances on household consumption and investment. This is \nfollowed by Section IV on statistical details and Section V on methodological notes and \nempirical estimations using household data. Conclusions are then summarized in the last \nsection.\n\n\fRemittances and Household Behavior in the Philippines  | \u0018\n\nII. Patterns of Migration and Remittance Flows \n\nToward the end of 2010, the Philippines will have completed a generation of international \nmigration and remittance experience. In the early years of temporary migration, demand \nfor workers was generally for low-skilled and technical workers. In the early 1970s, the \nPhilippines\u2019s labor export strategy benefited mostly the middle- and low-skilled workers \nsent to the oil-rich countries of the Middle East. With the changing global economic \nlandscape, the demand for Filipino labor subsequently followed the growth of individual \nlabor-importing countries. For instance, the growth of tiger economies in Asia led to an \nincrease in the demand for professional workers in the 1990s and also for domestic \nworkers. Similarly, social patterns in the United States (US) and western countries in \ngeneral required a significant number of nurses and caregivers, creating a large demand \nfor them.\n\nIn recent years, however, there has been a substantial decline in the professional \ncategory, especially compared to the condition in 2006. Meanwhile, demand for \nservices workers (of which around 70% are domestic workers and caregivers) remained \nrobust. The surge in production workers, on the other hand, was propelled mainly by \nthe construction boom in the Middle East and some parts of Asia, like Singapore and \nMacau, China.  Construction workers and ordinary laborers comprised around 26% of \ntotal production workers in 2008 as against only 19% in 2000. The global demand for \nFilipino workers is summarized through new hires data from the Philippine Overseas \nEmployment Administration (POEA), presented in Figures 3 and 4. These data suggest \nthat the bulk of the current batch of workers has shifted to lower skilled and lower income \nwork. The significant relative decline in the new hiring of professionals reveals that the \nlower salaried services and construction workers are supporting the sustained level of \nremittance inflows.\n\nThus, it can be deduced that the Philippines has started to be affected by changing global \ndemand as early as 2006. Prior to the global crisis in 2008, demand for Filipino workers \nstarted to move away from professionals to other worker categories, as can be seen \nfrom the increased number of deployed domestic and production workers (Table 1). The \ndecrease in demand for professionals will have an effect in the domestic economy, but it \nis not expected to be as large if domestic workers and production workers are affected \nby the crisis. Most professionals are generally flexible in finding other work opportunities \nand have the potential to become permanent residents, unlike domestic and production \nworkers who have fixed contracts and are susceptible to fluctuations of business of \ntheir employers. Production workers, in contrast, are directly hit by the crisis since they \nare mostly involved in export industries and construction projects in receiving countries. \nThis is validated by the impacts of closing down of factories in Taipei,China; hotels in \nMacau, China; and construction delays in the Middle East. On the other hand, most \ndomestic workers are virtually shielded from the crisis because most of their employers \nhave gotten used to a lifestyle with domestic help. Besides, the pay of these workers is \nrelatively affordable despite the crisis. This was also the lesson of the 1997 crisis when \nthe demand for this group remained the same.\n\n\f\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 188\n\nFigure 3: Deployed New-hire Overseas Workers, 1993\u20132007 (percent)\n\n1993\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1997\n\n1998\n\n1999\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\nService\nProfessional\nClerical\nAdministrative\nand Managerial\n\nSales\nProduction\nAgricultural\n\nSource:   Authors\u2019 estimates from Philippine Overseas Employment Administration data, \n \n\navailable: www.poea.gov.ph, downloaded 10 September 2009.\n\nFigure 4: Destinations of Overseas Workers, 1972\u20132006\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1,200,000\n\n1,000,000\n\n800,000\n\n600,000\n\n400,000\n\n200,000\n\n0\n\n1972\n\n1974\n\n1976\n\n1978\n\n1980\n\n1982\n\n1984\n\n1986\n\n1988\n\n1990\n\n1992\n\n1994\n\n1996\n\n1998\n\n2000\n\n2002\n\n2004\n\n2006\n\nSea-based\nTrust Territories\nAfrica\nAsia\n\nOceania\nAmericas\nEurope\nMiddle East\n\nSource:  Authors\u2019 estimates from Philippine Overseas Employment Administration data, available: www.poea.gov.ph, downloaded \n \n\n10 September 2009.\n\n\fRemittances and Household Behavior in the Philippines  | \u0018\n\nTable 1: Deployed Overseas Workers by Skills and Gender, 2007\n\nSkill Group\n\nFemale\n\nShare (%)\n\nDomestic helpers and related household workers\nProduction and related workers \nCaregivers and caretakers\nService workers\nWaiters, bartenders, and related workers\nPlumbers\nNurses, professional\nLaborers/general helpers\nElectrical workers\nCleaners and related workers\n\nMale\n\n2959\n15277\n1070\n5026\n3677\n9168\n1137\n6145\n6942\n927\n\n44919\n10640\n13329\n5294\n5599\n19\n8041\n1172\n38\n5373\n\nTotal\n\n47878\n25917\n14399\n10320\n9276\n9187\n9178\n7317\n6980\n6300\n\nTotal\n\n160046\n\n146337\n\n306383\n\nSource:   Department of Labor and Employment.\n\n15.6\n8.5\n4.7\n3.4\n3\n3\n3\n2.4\n2.3\n2.1\n\n100\n\nThe major source of remittance remains the US. This is partly because most banks in \nthe Middle East use the clearing system in US banks, making the source traceable to \nthe US. Nonetheless, there is a discernible plateau in remittances from the Americas \n(Figure 5). On a per country basis, remittance inflows reveal the extent of the global \nrecession. Latest data from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas shows that for 2009, there \nare at least five countries expected to exhibit a double-digit remittance decline from 2008, \ni.e., Hong Kong, China (minus 21 percent); Taipei,China (\u201340); US (\u201311); Italy (\u201318); \nand Kuwait (\u201333). These percentage declines, however, are aptly covered by increases \nin other countries, notably those from Europe, such as Germany (50%), Norway (89%), \nThe Netherlands (89%), Sweden (59%), and Greece (56%). Similarly, Saudi Arabia \nremittances are expected to increase by 10%. Nonetheless, there is still cause for \nconcern since the shares of these new countries are still relatively small and they are not \nthe regular markets for Filipino workers. The countries exhibiting declines in remittance \ninflows have been the top labor markets for the Philippines in the last two decades. \nBased on their consistency in the top five labor-importing countries annually from 1993 \nto 2007, the major labor-importing countries are Saudi Arabia; Hong Kong, China; \nSingapore; Qatar; Kuwait; and Taipei,China. A sustained decline in remittance inflows will \nmean an eventual decline in overall remittances.\n\n\f\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 188\n\nFigure 5: Origins of Overseas Filipinos\u2019 Remittances (percent)\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1997\n\n1998\n\n1999\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\nMiddle East\nOceania\nAsia\n\nEurope\nAmericas\n\nSource:   Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas website, available:www.bsp.gov.ph, downloaded 10 September 2009.\n\nThe previous discussion focused on demand for workers based on new hires data.  This \npart looks into the stock of workers. Table 2 shows the percentage of permanent and \ntemporary migrants in 2004 and 2007. It can be seen that the bulk of permanent Filipino \nworkers are in the US and about half of the temporary ones are based in the Middle East.  \nPermanent migrants composed 40% of the total migrants, while temporary migrants \ncontributed about 50%. The rest are considered undocumented. The permanent migrants \nin the US are generally affected by the crisis as some of them lost their jobs. But this \nmay not make them return home. The effect of the crisis has however been reflected in \nthe remittance inflows from the US, which is expected to decline by 11% in 2009. The \ntemporary migrants concentrated in the Middle East are mainly domestic and low-skilled \nproduction workers in the construction sector. This suggests that any significant decline in \nthe deployments will be due to two factors: a recession in the Middle East and a decline \nin demand for domestic workers. Except for the United Arab Emirates, Middle East \neconomies have not gone into recession, sustaining their demand for low-skilled workers.\n\n\fRemittances and Household Behavior in the Philippines  | \u0018\n\nTable 2: Stock Estimates of Overseas Filipino Workers, 2004 and 2007 (percent)\n\nPermanent\n\nTemporary\n\nAs of December 2004\n\nAfrica\nEast Asia\nMiddle East\nEurope\nUS\nOceania\nSea-based\n\nTotal \n\nAfrica\nEast Asia\nMiddle East\nEurope\nUS\nOceania\n\nTotal \n\nAs of December 2007\n\n0.01\n2.88\n0.07\n5.47\n84.38\n7.18\n\u2014\n\n100\n\n0.05\n5.79\n0.11\n7.72\n79.72\n6.61\n\n100\n\n1.54\n29.59\n31.90\n13.28\n17.21\n1.80\n4.68\n\n100\n\n1.69\n18.07\n49.73\n13.44\n8.57\n2.05\n\n100\n\nSource:   Commission on Filipinos Overseas.\n\nBox 1: Government Response to Help Displaced Overseas Workers\n\nGiven the spate of displacements of Filipino workers, the government has established the \nFilipino Expatriate Livelihood Support Fund (FELSF) to provide them with alternative livelihood. \nThe FELSF is handled primarily by the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration and the \nNational Reintegration Center for OFWs (NRCO). \n\nThe NRCO was established in 2007 as an agency of the Department of Labor, and serves as \nthe frontline office to provide social and economic assistance to returning migrant and displaced \nworkers. As a result of the current displacements, especially since December 2009 with the \nflows of returning factory workers from Taipei,China, NRCO was asked to handle the provision \nof reintegration services. These services include job matching for both local and overseas \nmarkets and the FELSF. The former is the most sought-after, which is reflected in the request to \nbe redeployed to another country.\n\nAs of 15 June 2009, the FELSF has served 7,762 displaced workers and provided economic \nloans worth P150 million. Some workers were referred to other overseas job placements. \nMoreover, from January to March 2009, the Comprehensive Livelihood and Emergency \nEmployment Program (CLEEP) and FELSF were included in the strategies for the Philippine \nlabor sector to mitigate the impact of the global economic crisis on Filipino workers. \n\nThe Philippine Overseas Employment Administration has forged agreements with Qatar; Saudi \nArabia; Canada; Australia; Japan; Republic of Korea; and Taipei,China to hire Filipinos to partly \nfill up their labor requirements (Remo 2009).\n\n\f8 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 188\n\nIII. Effects of Remittances on Recipient Households\u2014\nInternational Evidence \n\nTwo contrasting views regarding the effects of labor migration and remittances on the \neconomy of the labor-sending country are presented in this section. The optimistic \nperspective views labor migration and remittances as mechanisms for economic \ndevelopment, while the pessimistic view perceives migration and its accompanying \nremittances as an \u201cillness\u201d that weakens the economy (Cattaneo 2005). \n\nThe benefits that families derive from remittances largely depend on how and where \nthey spend the remittances. Adams (2007) in a review of findings from recent research \nsuggests that households receiving international remittances spend less at the margin \non consumption goods (like food) and more on investment goods (like education and \nhousing). Cattaneo (2005) notes that remittances are typically spent on investments \nin physical assets and in human capital, such as education and health, which can \nstimulate growth. Households receiving international remittances also tend to invest \nmore in entrepreneurial activities. Therefore, remittances may stimulate the economy by \nboosting aggregate demand and output through increased consumption and investment \nexpenditures of recipient households and their multiplier effects. \n\nEducation and health are two factors that augment human capital development, thereby \ncontributing to long-term growth. Ratha et al. (2007) opined that to the extent that \nremittances finance education and health and increase investment, remittances could \nhave a positive effect on economic growth. A study on Pakistan (Mansuri 2007) observes \nthat remittances have a positive and significant effect on child education and health, \nincluding a gender-equalizing effect, as the gains for girls are appreciably greater than \nthose for boys. Moreover, with better access to schooling, children in remittance-recipient \nhouseholds tend to work substantially fewer hours. A study on the Philippines (Yang \n2005) finds that households whose overseas workers experienced favorable exchange-\nrate shocks (during the Asian financial crisis) were able to reduce child labor, increase \neducational spending, improve child schooling, and afford higher ownership of durable \ngoods. \n\nIn Latin America, the effect of remittances on the educational attainment of children is \ngenerally restricted to children with low levels of parental schooling. Acosta, Fajnzylber, \nand Lopez (2007) find that remittances increase educational attainment of children with a \nlow level of parental schooling in a sample of 11 Latin American countries. In El Salvador, \nremittances prolong a child\u2019s education (Edwards and Ureta 2003). In Mexico, Lopez-\nCordova (2004) finds that as the fraction of remittance-receiving households increases, \nchild illiteracy and school attendance among children aged 6\u201314 years old improves. \nAdams (2006) shows that in Guatemala remittance-receiving households spend less on \nconsumption and more on education than households that do not receive remittances. \n\n\fRemittances and Household Behavior in the Philippines  | \u0018\n\nEdwards and Ureta (2003) compare the impacts of remittances and other income on \neducation in El Salvador and conclude that remittances greatly reduce the hazard of \nchildren leaving school. Yang (2004) shows that remittances lead to higher spending on \neducation, more schooling, and less child labor in the Philippines. However, Mckenzie \n(2006) finds that migration lowered educational attainment of children, which he attributes \nto parental absence arising from current migration. \n\nMigration and remittances are also found to positively affect the health status of recipient \nfamilies, e.g., by improving nutrition and access to health care (Yang 2003). De and \nRatha (2005) find that remittances have a significant positive impact on the weight of \nchildren under five in Sri Lanka. In Mexico, Hildebrant and McKenzie (2005) find that \nMexico\u2013US migration improves child health outcomes, i.e., lower infant mortality rates \nand higher birth weights. The study identifies two channels of the effect: one is the health \nimprovements brought about by increases in income and another is that having a migrant \nfamily member is associated with an increase in the level of health knowledge among the \nmothers. Acosta, Fajnzylber, and Lopez (2007) find that remittances improved children\u2019s \nhealth, particularly in low-income households, in Nicaragua and Guatemala. World Bank \n(2006) arrives at similar conclusions.\n\nSeveral studies have found that remittances increase savings and investment in physical \ncapital. Recipient households often consider remittances to be transitory income. \nTherefore, they save a larger proportion of remittance receipts (often in the form of \ninvestment in real estate) than other income. In addition, remittances ease liquidity \nconstraints and serve as insurance for many recipient households, inducing them to \ninvest in business ventures and take entrepreneurial risks. Adams (1991) finds that in \nrural Egypt, remittance-receiving households have a higher propensity to invest than \nthose households that do not receive remittances. Adams (1998 and 2002) shows that \nin rural Pakistan, the propensity to save out of remittance receipts is much higher than \nthat for most other forms of income (including agricultural income and rental income) and \nremittance receipts have a greater positive effect on accumulation of rural assets than \nlabor income. Brown and Walker (1995) conclude that in Tonga, remittance-receiving \nhouseholds have a much higher savings rate than those that do not receive remittances; \nand that in Samoa and Tonga, a significant proportion of remittance receipts is used for \nbusiness and farm investment.  Brown and Leeves (2007) find that in Fiji and Tonga, \nremittance-receiving households are able to restructure their income sources away \nfrom traditional subsistence activities toward more market-oriented business ventures. \nEBRD (2006) presents the results of a business survey conducted in 2005 in Albania, \nBosnia-Herzegovina, Georgia, Moldova, and the former Serbia and Montenegro, which \nshow that a small but important share of remittance inflows to these countries is used \nto finance investment and enterprise creation. Woodruff and Zenteno (2001) estimate \nthat remittances account for about 20% of the capital invested in microenterprises in \nurban Mexico and the figure is higher for female-owned businesses. World Bank (2006) \nestimates that growth of remittance inflows led to a 2% increase in the share of domestic \ninvestment to GDP in Latin American countries from 1991 to 1995, and 2001 to 2005.\n\n\f10 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 188\n\nAlthough remittances accrue directly to households with migrant members, families that \ndo not receive remittances can also benefit indirectly from these transfers, thus promoting \nlocal development through spillovers. First, increased consumption of migrant households \ncan generate multiplier effects. If recipient families increase their household consumption \nof local goods and services, this will benefit other members of the community through an \nincrease in demand, which stimulates local production, thereby promoting job creation \nand local development. Adelman and Taylor (1990) estimate that every dollar Mexico \nreceives from migrants working abroad increases its gross national product by US$2.69\u2013\n3.17. Van Doorn (2003) estimates that remittances sent to Bangladesh have a multiplier \neffect of 3.3 on gross national product, 2.8 on consumption, and 0.4 on investment. \nHowever, the multiplier effect of remittances can be substantially reduced by supply \ninelasticities as shown by Taylor (1999) and Yunez-Naude et al. (1998). Insofar as supply \nis inelastic, increased expenditures of recipient households financed by remittances \npush prices up and adversely affect well-being of nonrecipient households. Second, \nremittances are also found to prop up formation of small-scale enterprises, thereby \npromoting local development. Workers\u2019 remittances ease credit constraints and provide \nworking capital for the recipients to engage in entrepreneurial activities. This results in \njob creation and enhances the development of the remittance-receiving locality. Woodruff \nand Zenteno (2001), utilizing survey data for 12,005 microenterprises owned by 11,823 \nindividuals in 44 urban areas in Mexico, find a large positive impact of remittances on \nmicroenterprise development. \n\nRemittances may also contribute to the creation of new social assets and services and \ncommunity physical infrastructures such as schools, health centers, roads, and other \ncommunity projects. This is where the role of migrant associations comes in. These \nassociations usually pool their resources and send them to their home communities \n(Ghosh 2006). According to Sorensen and Pedersen (2002), they may serve as \nplatforms that bring significant development in the communities, benefiting both migrant \nand nonmigrant families. At the community level, remittances are found to affect the \ndistribution of income. Ravanilla and Robleza (2003) apply decomposition analysis to \ninvestigate the contribution of remittances to total income inequality in the Philippines. \nDakila and Dakila (2006) analyze the effect of remittances to the Philippines through \na computable general equilibrium model and show that the main beneficiaries of \nremittances are the middle class. Tullao et al. (2007) showed that the proportion of \nemployed workers in families receiving remittances in the Philippines is lower than \nthose that did not. They opined that the benefits of migration will be reaped by the more \neducated and families with ability to pay. This will contribute to widening of income \ninequality.\n\nAlthough labor migration and remittances provide households with considerable benefits, \nthere are also substantial economic and social costs associated with it. On the economic \nside, one curious issue is the extent to which family members in remittance-recipient \nhouseholds reduce their work effort\u2014a moral hazard effect on labor supply. Migration \n\n\fRemittances and Household Behavior in the Philippines  | 11\n\nmay generate dependency behavior at the household level (Meins 2007). Overseas \nremittances as pointed out by Bridi (2005) do promote idleness on the part of the \nrecipients. Chami et al. (2005) argue that migration may create a moral hazard problem \nby inducing disincentives to work among migrant household members. There is evidence \nof a decline in labor force participation among remittance recipients\u2014more among \nfemales than males\u2014in El Salvador (Acosta 2006) and in the Philippines (Rodriguez \nand Tiongson 2001; Tullao, Cortez, and See 2007), with the gender effect depending on \nwhether the wife or the husband is the recipient (Cabigen 2006). However, this appears \nto be matched by an increase in entrepreneurial activities, such as microenterprises for \nwomen and self-employment for men (Acosta 2006; Yang 2004; Rozelle, Taylor, and \nDeBraw 1999). \n\nFurther on the negative side, remittances can reduce labor supply by raising reservation \nwages of remittance recipients (Acosta 2006; Azam and Gubert 2006; Bussolo and \nMedvedev 2007; Kim 2007; World Bank 2006). This can push wages up and lead to \nappreciation of the real exchange rate. However, the decline in labor supply resulting from \noutward migration and remittances is often compensated by a rise in labor productivity \ndue to investments financed from remittances (Lucas 1987; Taylor, Rozelle, and deBrauw \n2003).\n\nWhile the economic costs and benefits of labor migration are relatively well known, \nthis does not seem to be true of the psychosocial costs to migrants and their families. \nOne early study (Fasick 1967) finds that the children of migratory agricultural workers \nin the US suffer from severe educational retardation as they have to substitute for the \nwork of their absent parents. Similarly, a Mexican study (McKenzie 2006) points out \nsome unfavorable effects of migration, such as on child care (less breastfeeding and \nuncompleted schedule of vaccines). Another Mexican study (Aguilera-Guzman et al. \n2004) notes that the children of migrants are more susceptible to such problems as drug \nabuse and absenteeism or dropping out of school. A Caribbean study (Crawford-Brown \nand Rattray 2002) finds that children left behind are likely to suffer from such emotional \nand psychological problems as depression, withdrawal, and running-away behavior due to \nthe lack of parental contact and supervision. \n\nRodriguez (2000) writes that migration has unfavorable effects on the sender\u2019s family in \nthe form of broken families, fatherless children, and other problems as a result of parental \nabsence. Furthermore, remittances can also cause family tensions within households \nwith migrants. Women are increasingly migrating as the main economic providers, or \n\u201cbreadwinners\u201d for their households. Paid domestic work is increasingly performed by \nwomen who left their own countries and communities, and often their families. Domestic \nservice drew not only women from poor socioeconomic classes, but also women of \nrelatively high status in their own countries. In the developed world, the combination of \nwomen\u2019s increased participation in the workforce and the failure to develop family-friendly \nlabor policies and childcare options has led to a growing demand for migrant women. \n\n\f1\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 188\n\nIV. A Statistical Profile of Remittances and Households\n\nUtilizing data from the 2000, 2003, and 2006 Family Income and Expenditure Survey \n(FIES), this section analyzes the role of remittances in household consumption, \ninvestments, and poverty reduction. The 3-year data capture changes in the world \neconomy and the corresponding changes in the demand for Filipino workers. First, the \nperiod preceding these 6 years was beset by the Asian financial crisis and reflected the \nchange in demand. Second, monthly remittance levels recovered only beginning 2003 \nafter the monthly highs of 1997. Also, it is unlikely that the monthly levels of remittances \nwill go back to the pre-2006 levels even with flat growth for 2009 (see Figure 6).\n\nFigure 6: Monthly Remittance Flows (\u2018000 US dollars)\n\n1,400,000\n\n1,200,000\n\n1,000,000\n\n800,000\n\n600,000\n\n400,000\n\n200,000\n\n0\n\nJan-89\n\nJan-90\n\nJan-91\n\nJan-92\n\nJan-93\n\nJan-94\n\nJan-95\n\nJan-96\n\nJan-97\n\nJan-98\n\nJan-99\n\nJan-00\n\nJan-01\n\nJan-02\n\nJan-03\n\nJan-04\n\nJan-05\n\nJan-06\n\nSource:    Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas website, available:www.bsp.gov.ph, downloaded 10 September 2009.\n\nAs remittances evidently provide an alternative source of income, it is of interest to find \ntheir impact on households that receive them and those that do not. The FIES datasets \nare used to capture the difference between remittance-receiving households and the \nnonreceiving ones. Among recipients, the average family size is generally larger and the \nnumber of employed members fewer than nonrecipients (Table 3). This perhaps brings \ninto play higher dependency ratio as a factor in generating remittances. Additionally, \nremittance-receiving households have more extended family members than those that \nare not. This validates the observation that migrant families have relatives who assume \nparental or guardian roles in the absence of one or both parents (Box 2). Data for \n2006 shows that the average annual income of a household receiving remittances is \nabout P254,000, exceeding the average income of nonreceiving remittance households \nby 73%. The latter depend significantly more on wages and entrepreneurial income \n(Figure 7). Remittance-receiving households earn more from their investments and have \nhigher savings rate than nonremittance households. However, there are observational \n\n\fRemittances and Household Behavior in the Philippines  | 1\u0018\n\nevidences showing remittance-receiving families as having difficulties managing their \nsavings (Box 2). Moreover, families that receive cash from abroad spend appreciably \nlarger shares of expenditure on education, health, durable goods, transport and \ncommunications, and housing by lowering the share on food expenditure (Figure 8).       \n\nTable 3: Main Characteristics of Households, 2000, 2003, and 2006\n\nNational per Capita \nIncome Decile\n\nFamily Size\n\nHousehold Type\n\n2000\n\nNumber of Employed \nMembers\n\nNational per Capita \nIncome Decile\n\nFamily Size\n\nHousehold Type\n\n2003\n\nNumber of Employed \nMembers\n\nR\n\n6.5 \n6.4 \n6.3 \n5.9 \n5.9 \n5.4 \n5.2 \n5.0 \n4.7 \n3.9 \n\nR\n\n6.8 \n6.3 \n5.8 \n5.5 \n5.3 \n5.1 \n4.9 \n4.8 \n4.4 \n3.7 \n\nR\n\n6.9 \n6.6 \n5.8 \n5.5 \n5.2 \n5.1 \n4.8 \n4.6 \n4.3 \n3.7 \n\nNR\n\n6.7 \n5.9 \n5.5 \n5.2 \n5.1 \n4.9 \n4.8 \n4.6 \n4.4 \n3.9 \n\nNR\n\n6.3 \n5.5 \n5.1 \n4.7 \n4.6 \n4.4 \n4.3 \n4.2 \n3.9 \n3.5 \n\nNR\n\n6.4 \n5.5 \n5.1 \n4.7 \n4.5 \n4.4 \n4.4 \n4.2 \n4.0 \n3.5 \n\nR\n\n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.7 \n1.6 \n1.7 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.4 \n1.4 \n\nR\n\n1.8 \n1.7 \n1.7 \n1.7 \n1.7 \n1.7 \n1.7 \n1.8 \n1.8 \n1.7 \n\nR\n\n1.8 \n1.8 \n1.7 \n1.8 \n1.7 \n1.7 \n1.8 \n1.7 \n1.7 \n1.7 \n\nNR\n\n1.7 \n1.7 \n1.7 \n1.7 \n1.8 \n1.8 \n1.8 \n1.9 \n1.9 \n1.9 \n\nNR\n\n1.7 \n1.7 \n1.8 \n1.8 \n1.8 \n1.8 \n1.9 \n1.9 \n1.9 \n1.9 \n\nNR\n\n1.8 \n1.9 \n1.8 \n1.8 \n1.9 \n1.9 \n1.9 \n1.9 \n2.0 \n1.9 \n\nR\n\n1.2 \n1.3 \n1.3 \n1.3 \n1.4 \n1.4 \n1.4 \n1.4 \n1.4 \n1.3 \n\nR\n\n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.3 \n1.3 \n1.3 \n1.3 \n1.3 \n1.3 \n\nR\n\n1.3 \n1.3 \n1.3 \n1.3 \n1.3 \n1.3 \n1.4 \n1.4 \n1.4 \n1.3 \n\nNR\n\n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.3 \n1.3 \n1.2 \n\nNR\n\n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n\nNR\n\n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.3 \n1.2 \n\nNational per Capita \nIncome Decile\n\nFamily Size\n\nHousehold Type\n\n2006\n\nNumber of Employed \nMembers\n\nFirst\nSecond\nThird\nFourth\nFifth\nSixth\nSeventh\nEight\nNinth\nTenth\n\nFirst\nSecond\nThird\nFourth\nFifth\nSixth\nSeventh\nEight\nNinth\nTenth\n\nFirst\nSecond\nThird\nFourth\nFifth\nSixth\nSeventh\nEight\nNinth\nTenth\n\nR = households receiving transfers/remittances from abroad; NR = households not receiving transfers from abroad.\nHousehold type: 1 = single family; 2 = extended family; 3 = with two or more nonmembers.\nSource:   Authors\u2019 estimates from Family Income and Expenditure Surveys 2000, 2003, and 2006.\n\n\f1\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 188\n\nBox 2: Responses of Migrant Households to Social and Economic Situations\n\nDealing with Parental Absence\n\nFor some time now, the Philippines has been enduring what is called the social costs of \nmigration, especially for families with parents who had to go overseas and leave their children \nbehind. Family members rely on international communication to keep their families together. \nSociologists have noted the resilience of Filipino families in dealing with this situation. For \nexample, relatives of the parent/parents who went abroad, such as aunts or grandparents, help \ntake care of the children left behind. In case the mother is away, anecdotal evidence and some \nqualitative studies show that female children do household responsibilities. Some husbands \nleft behind also do family-rearing roles usually done by their wives. As regards managing \nremittances, there is a gender bias in favor of women. Recent studies show that among Filipino \nmigrants in Italy, for example, remitters usually trust women family members left behind to take \ncontrol of the remittance money and the trusted woman is not always the wife, but can be the \nmother or sister of the remitter (International Organization for Migration 2009a). The mothers \nand sisters left behind are also the trusted remittance recipients for Filipino migrants in Malaysia \n(International Organization for Migration 2009b).\n\nDealing with Savings\n\nSome case studies have found that households receiving remittances have a hard time saving \nsome of their remittances, especially if the remittance-receiving household has more family \nmembers or relatives. In this context, financial literacy programs for overseas Filipinos and their \nfamilies have proven to be an important intervention to address the remittance management \npractices of migrants and their families. Equipping them with knowledge and skills to help them \nmanage their remittances is one means to help mitigate the social costs of migration.1 \n\nDealing with Currency Fluctuations\n\nThe effects of the current global economic recession on remittance flows to the Philippines show \nthat Filipino migrant remitters try to send as much remittance as possible so that families left \nbehind will somewhat maintain their current economic standard. Remitters are also watchful of \ndevelopments such as a stronger currency, and tend to send more remittances to keep pace \nwith the prices of goods (Javellana-Santos and Santiago 2007).\n\nDealing with Displacements\n\nReturning migrants due to job displacement or nonrenewal of contract usually try to continually \nsecure a stable source of income by going back to the POEA to look for new contracts. They \nalso contact relatives and friends in the countries where they just came from for possible \nredeployment. Others try to set up a small business\u2014with or without the capacity to engage in \nbusiness.2 Unfortunately, some of them, in particular young workers staying in host countries \nfor only a few months who had their contracts cancelled, had incurred debts from loans to pay \nplacement fees and other migration-related costs (Opiniano and de la Paz 2009).  Government \nsupport like the NRCO provides livelihood loans for them but there is no guarantee that the \nassistance received is what the returning migrants want.\n\n         1 \n\n         2 \n\nIf migrant families encounter some problems, some remittances received from abroad are even used to spend for items or \nservices (e.g., counselling) to address family-related issues (Capili and del Castillo 2006).\nSince 2005, the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) has implemented a Livelihood Development Program \nfor OFWs. Through conduit financial institutions, OWWA hands out enterprise loans of at least PhP150,000 to returning \noverseas workers (in particular, members of OWWA who paid a US$25 membership fee per contract), with interest rates of \n3% monthly. \n\n\fRemittances and Household Behavior in the Philippines  | 1\u0018\n\nFigure 7: Sources of Income for Recipient versus Nonrecipient Households (percent)\n\n2000\n\n2003\n\n2006\n\nAgricultural\nwage\n\nNon-\nagricultural\nwage\n\nDomestic\nremittance\n\nEntrep-\nreneurial\nincome\n\nInvestment\nincome\n\nSavings\n\nAgricultural\nwage\n\nNon-\nagricultural\nwage\n\nDomestic\nremittance\n\nEntrep-\nreneurial\nincome\n\nInvestment\nincome\n\nSavings\n\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nAgricultural\nwage\n\nNon-\nagricultural\nwage\n\nDomestic\nremittance\n\nEntrep-\nreneurial\nincome\n\nInvestment\nincome\n\nSavings\n\nHouseholds receiving transfers\nfrom abroad\n\nHouseholds not receiving transfers\nfrom abroad\n\nNote: \n \n\nTotal income = wages and salaries + other income + entrepreneurial income. \nOther income = net share of crops + cash receipts from abroad + cash receipts from domestic + rental from nonagriculture \n+ interest income + pension + dividends + rental income + gifts + income from sustenance activities + other necessities.\n\nSource:   Authors\u2019 calculations based on Family Income and Expenditure Surveys 2000, 2003, and 2006. \n\n\f1\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 188\n\nA remittance-receiving household\u2019s allocation for nonfood expenditures such as education, \nhealth, and others is almost twice that of a nonremittance household. This seems that \nremittance-receiving households spend more in human resources than those households \nthat do not receive remittances. By increasing household investment in human and \nphysical capital, remittances have the potential, at the aggregate macroeconomic level, to \nrebalance growth toward domestic demand and to create long-term growth.\n\nThe percentage of households receiving remittances was 18% in 2000, 21% in 2003, and \n23% in 2006, with the increase reflected across all income classes (Table 4). However, \nif this is broken down by quintiles, less than 10% of lower income households receive \nremittances. The proportion increases consistently through the higher income quintiles, \nexceeding 35% for the fifth quintile in all the three surveys. By 2006, the percentage of \nrecipients from the lowest quintile had increased to about 7% from about 4% in 2000 and \n5% in 2003. This increase coincides with deployment data showing that the increase in \ntemporary migrants in recent years is mostly from domestic/service workers and not from \nprofessionals. \n\nAmong the higher income quintiles, the biggest share of income is at 15% received \nby the fifth quintile in 2006. If this is converted to a monthly flow per household, it is \nestimated to be around US$120. In contrast, the poorest quintile received only 1.3% \nof income from abroad. What may be of more significance to poorer households are \ndomestic remittances, which come mainly from internal migration of domestic helpers \nand other service workers from rural areas to urban centers. Poorer households tend to \nreceive a relatively higher percentage of income from this internal flow. This reveals that \ninternal migration and remittance generates more welfare than international migration \namong the poorer households. This same view was earlier espoused by Pernia (2008). \nSimilarly, entrepreneurial income constitutes close to 40% of income received by these \nhouseholds\u2014twice the share for the fifth quintile. This is explained mainly by the lack of \nformal income sources among them.

On the contrary, if they spend \nremittance receipts mainly for conspicuous consumption, possible longer-term benefits \n\n\fRemittances and Household Behavior in the Philippines  | 1\u0018\n\nare jeopardized. A number of studies have examined the impact of remittances on \nhouseholds in the Philippines. Tabuga (2007) looked into the effect of remittances (as a \ndummy variable) on the expenditures of Filipino households using the 2003 FIES. Based \non a censored Tobit model and quintile regressions, the study found that remittances \nincrease consumption of goods and leisure, including spending on education, housing, \nmedical care, and durable goods. Similarly, Tullao, Cortes, and See (2007) note that \nremittances lead to higher human capital investments in education and health. Pernia \n(2008), using data in 2000 and 2003 and employing a remittance dummy as well, \nsupported these findings. His results revealed that remittances enhance household \nsavings and spending on education and health care. A logit regression showed that the \nshare of remittances in household income raises the likelihood of a household getting out \nof poverty. Yang (2005) took a slightly different angle by focusing on the impact of the \nAsian financial crisis through exchange rate shocks. Using first differenced regressions \nhe found that appreciation of a migrant\u2019s currency against the Philippine peso leads to \nincreases in household remittances received from overseas. The shocks lead to greater \nchild schooling, reduced child labor, and increased educational expenditure. Moreover, \nfavorable exchange rate shocks also promote self employment and lead to greater entry \ninto relatively capital-intensive enterprises by migrants\u2019 origin households.\n\nIn general, these studies do not take into account the reverse causality occuring, for \ninstance, when international remittances help reduce household poverty but at the \nsame time, the level of poverty may also influence the amount of remittances received \nby a household. Similarly, while remittances can be expected to influence household \nexpenditure shares of different items (i.e., food), the causality can be in the reverse \ndirection as well. For example, whether a household receives remittance or not may \nitself depend on the level of expenditure on food in the absence of remittances. Thus, \nignoring reverse causality in analyzing the impact of remittances on households might \nlead to erroneous conclusions. For such reasons it has become a common practice in \nrecent remittances research to test for endogeneity or to assume that endogeneity exists \nespecially when using household survey data. A common solution to eliminate the bias \narising from this issue is to use instrumental variables. If a test for endogeneity reveals \nthat there is a relationship between remittances and household income, for instance, \ninstrumental variable techniques can be used to control for such endogeneity bias arising \nfrom omitted variables and reverse causation. Instrumental variable techniques are thus \nused to measure the net effect of remittances upon expenditure, income, and poverty \nindicators, or other variables of interest (Ozden and Schiff 2006). \n\nThis section analyzes the relationship between remittances and household expenditure \non consumption and investment in the Philippines to evaluate the extent to which the \npropensity to spend differs between different items. The objective of this exercise is to \nsee if remittance as a source of income is important to households in influencing different \ncomponents of their expenditure. This study uses 2006 household level data to examine \nthe impact of remittances on household expenditure share on food, education, health, \nhousing, adult goods (tobacco and alcohol), gifts, leisure activities, and other items.\n\n\f\u00180 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 188\n\nA.  Methodology\n\nA reduced form equation is used to estimate the effects of remittances on household \nexpenditures. Share of expenditure on each item is assumed to be a linear function of \nthe logarithm of the total per capita consumption expenditure, dependency ratio, sex \nand education of the household head, a dummy variable indicating if the household is a \nremittance receiving household, and an interaction term dummy times logarithm of total \nper capita consumption expenditure.\n\nThe functional form is written as follows.\n\nsi = \u03b2 + \u03b2m log(total per capita consumption expenditure) + \u03b2remit (remit) + \u03b2rm (remit x \nlog(total per capita consumption expenditure)) + \u03b2dr (dependency ratio) + \u03b2hsex (sex of \nhousehold head) + \u03b2hedu (education of household head)\n\nwhere si is the share of expenditure on a particular item of household\u2019s budget and remit \nis a dummy variable taking the value 1 for households receiving remittances and value 0 \nfor others.\n\nEstimating such an equation using the ordinary least squares method, as in most of \nthe previous studies, is likely to yield biased coefficient estimates due to bidirectional \ncausality between the dependent variable and the remittance dummy. In order to account \nfor this endogeneity we identified instrumental variables for the remittance dummy and \nused a two stage least squares procedure to estimate the model.\n\nA good instrumental variable, one that is correlated with the explanatory variable but \nuncorrelated with the outcome variable, can eliminate the biases that arise from this \nendogeneity. In practice, however, selecting a good instrumental variable in remittances \nwork can be difficult. For example, if remittance is the explanatory variable and \nexpenditure is the outcome variable of interest, the challenge is to find an instrumental \nvariable that is correlated with remittances but exogenous to expenditure. In the current \nexercise, several instruments were considered for the remittance dummy. Those that \nturned out to be suitable were household asset holdings such as ownership of cars, \ntelevisions, and refrigerators, and the ratio of entrepreneurial income to total income.1 \n\nB. \n\nResults\n\nThe results of the first stage ordinary least squares test, in general, show that the \ninstruments are strong with a 10% level of significance. The results of the test for the null \nhypothesis whether the instruments and the model are correct show the instruments to be \nvalid for most of the equations. The estimated results are given in Table 5.\n\n1  For example, Brown (2008) considers wealth as an instrumental variable that ensures longer-term financial security \nand provides an indicator of the permanent income compared to the observed transitory income or expenditure \nin the household survey year. Unlike time-series or panel data, cross-sectional data cannot capture high levels of \nvolatility in transitory income that moves households in and out of poverty over time.\n\n\fRemittances and Household Behavior in the Philippines  | \u00181\n\n*\n*\n*\n2\n9\n1\n0\n\n.\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n4\n2\n0\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n1\n2\n0\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n9\n0\n0\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n*\n*\n*\n6\n1\n0\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n7\n3\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n9\n2\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n4\n3\n0\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n*\n*\n*\n4\n6\n1\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n \n\na\nt\ni\np\na\nc\n\n \nr\ne\np\n\n \nl\n\na\nt\no\nT\n\ns\nd\no\no\ng\n\n \n\nd\nn\na\n\nl\n\no\nh\no\nc\nl\na\n\ns\nr\ne\nh\nt\nO\n\n \n\n \n\nl\n\nd\no\nh\ne\ns\nu\no\nH\n\ns\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nr\ne\np\no\n\ns\nm\ne\nt\ni\n\n \n \n\ne\nl\nb\na\nr\nu\nD\n\n \n\ne\nr\nu\ns\ni\ne\nL\n\n \n\ns\nt\nf\ni\nG\n\n \n \nr\ne\nm\nu\ns\nn\no\nC\n\n \n\n \n\no\nc\nc\na\nb\no\nT\n\n \n\ng\nn\ni\ns\nu\no\nH\n\n \n\nl\na\nc\ni\nd\ne\nM\n\n \n\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nc\nu\nd\nE\n\n \n\nd\no\no\nF\n\n \n\ns\nt\nl\nu\ns\ne\nR\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nm\n\n \n\ni\nt\ns\nE\n\n \n:\n\n \n\n5\ne\nl\nb\na\nT\n\n.\n\n9\n2\n\n*\n*\n*\n7\n4\n9\n4\n\n.\n\n.\n\n8\n2\n\n*\n*\n*\n4\n4\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n.\n\n8\n2\n\u2013\n\n*\n7\n2\n0\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n3\n0\n\n.\n\n8\n3\n1\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n1\n0\n\n.\n\n.\n\n2\n0\n\u2013\n\n1\n1\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n5\n0\n0\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n.\n\n7\n1\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n5\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n2\n1\n\u2013\n\n*\n*\n*\n6\n0\n1\n2\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n5\n8\n2\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n.\n\n0\n3\n\n5\n0\n0\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n0\n3\n\n.\n\n5\n0\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n1\n2\n\n.\n\n7\n2\n0\n\n.\n\n4\n0\n1\n0\n\n.\n\n0\n\n8\n7\n6\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n.\n\n3\n1\n\u2013\n\n6\n8\n7\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n.\n\n2\n1\n\u2013\n\n*\n7\n4\n8\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n.\n\n7\n2\n\u2013\n\n*\n0\n1\n3\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n9\n0\n\n.\n\n1\n1\n0\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n.\n\n7\n0\n\u2013\n\n1\n6\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n.\n\n7\n0\n\n3\n0\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n.\n\n3\n0\n\n.\n\n9\n3\n\u2013\n\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n.\n\n7\n0\n\n1\n1\n0\n\n.\n\n6\n1\n9\n0\n\n.\n\n.\n\n5\n1\n\u2013\n\n7\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n5\n1\n\n.\n\n5\n0\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n9\n0\n\n.\n\n.\n\n8\n1\n\u2013\n\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n5\n1\n\n.\n\n6\n4\n1\n\n.\n\n4\n1\n3\n0\n\n.\n\n.\n\n8\n1\n\u2013\n\n*\n5\n7\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n8\n1\n\n.\n\n7\n0\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n5\n1\n\n.\n\n.\n\n7\n0\n\u2013\n\n8\n1\n1\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n4\n0\n\n.\n\n.\n\n4\n0\n\u2013\n\n1\n1\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n.\n\n9\n1\n\u2013\n\n*\n7\n2\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n9\n1\n\n.\n\n*\n*\n*\n5\n0\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n.\n\n6\n0\n\u2013\n\n*\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n9\n2\n\n.\n\n*\n*\n*\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n.\n\n1\n3\n\u2013\n\n9\n1\n\n.\n\n.\n\n3\n4\n\u2013\n\n*\n*\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n*\n*\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n*\n*\n*\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n2\n2\n\n.\n\n6\n3\n1\n\n.\n\n3\n5\n2\n0\n\n.\n\n.\n\n1\n2\n\u2013\n\n5\n1\n1\n\n.\n\n7\n5\n1\n0\n\n.\n\n4\n\u2013\n\n9\n2\n\n.\n\n*\n*\n*\n5\n9\n1\n0\n\n.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n4\n1\n0\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n.\n\n4\n1\n\u2013\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n0\n\n.\n\n8\n0\n\u2013\n\n1\n0\n\n.\n\n4\n2\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n6\n5\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n3\n1\n\n.\n\n8\n3\n3\n0\n\n.\n\n6\n0\n\n.\n\n6\n0\n\n.\n\n3\n0\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n4\n0\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n7\n0\n\n.\n\n.\n\n5\n3\n\u2013\n\n1\n\n1\n\u2013\n\n5\n7\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n*\n*\n6\n1\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n.\n\n1\n1\n\u2013\n\n4\n3\n8\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n1\n2\n\n.\n\n4\n4\n\n.\n\n*\n*\n*\n7\n0\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n*\n*\n*\n4\n0\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n*\n*\n*\n7\n0\n0\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n*\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n*\n*\n*\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n*\n*\n*\n4\n0\n0\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n*\n*\n*\n5\n0\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n*\n*\n*\n1\n1\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n*\n*\n*\n1\n0\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n9\n3\n\n.\n\n3\n1\n1\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n3\n8\n2\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n.\n\n9\n4\n\u2013\n\n7\n1\n1\n\n.\n\n9\n0\n4\n0\n\n.\n\n*\n*\n*\n5\n1\n2\n\n.\n\n7\n7\n5\n\n.\n\n.\n\n2\n1\n\u2013\n\n.\n\ny\nl\ne\nv\n\ni\nt\nc\ne\np\ns\ne\nr\n \n,\n\ne\nc\nn\na\nc\nfi\nn\ng\ni\ns\n \nf\no\n\ni\n\n \nl\n\ne\nv\ne\n\nl\n \n\n \n\n%\n1\nd\nn\na\n\n \n,\n\n%\n5\n\n \n\n \n,\n\n%\n0\n1\n\n \n\ne\nt\na\nc\ni\nd\nn\n\ni\n \n*\n*\n*\n \n,\n\n*\n*\n \n,\n\n*\n\n.\n\n9\n4\n\u2013\n\n*\n4\n6\n5\n1\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n.\n\n7\n1\n\u2013\n\n*\n9\n3\n1\n0\n\n.\n\n7\n1\n\n.\n\n0\n\n9\n0\n\n.\n\n.\n\n1\n0\n\u2013\n\n3\n0\n0\n0\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n \n\nn\no\ni\nt\np\nm\nu\ns\nn\no\nc\n\n \n \n\ne\nr\nu\nt\ni\nd\nn\ne\np\nx\ne\n\n \n \n\n \n\ne\nc\nn\na\nt\nt\ni\n\nm\ne\nR\n\ny\nm\nm\nu\nd\n\n \n \n\nm\nr\ne\nt\n \nn\no\ni\nt\nc\na\nr\ne\nt\nn\n\nI\n\n \n\nl\n\nd\na\ne\nh\nd\no\nh\ne\ns\nu\no\nh\n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nf\no\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nc\nu\nd\nE\n\n \n \n\ny\nc\nn\ne\nd\nn\ne\np\ne\nD\n\no\ni\nt\na\nr\n \n \n\nt\nn\na\nt\ns\nn\no\nC\n\n8\n0\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n \n\nl\n\nd\no\nh\ne\ns\nu\no\nh\n \nf\no\nx\ne\nS\n\n \n\nd\na\ne\nh\n\n \n \n\n\f\u0018\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 188\n\nThe estimated results show that except for the food share equation, the fit is poor for \nmost equations. In the food share equation the coefficient of the remittance dummy \nis statistically significant (at 10% level of significance) and negative, indicating that \nthe share of expenditure on food is on an average lower for households receiving \nremittances. The coefficient on the interaction term is positive and significant at the 10% \nlevel of significance, indicating that the marginal propensity to consume food is higher \nfor remittance-receiving households. However, unlike previous studies, our estimations \nshow that remittances to the Philippines do not have a significant influence on other \nitems of consumption or investment. In the case of medical expenditure, the remittance \ncoefficient is positive but insignificant. On the other hand, the regression coefficient for \nthe remittance variable is negative and insignificant for education and durable goods \nspending. In other words, our analysis does not support any evidence of remittances \ncontributing toward human or physical capital development. This implies that these flows \nmay not help in rebalancing growth toward domestic demand. \n\nLastly, we implemented a logistic regression of the impact of remittance to poverty \ndirectly. For this, we defined the probability of getting out of poverty based on the \npoverty income threshold of 2006. This was determined to be around P75,000 for a \nfamily of five or roughly P15,000 per annum. All the households receiving an income \nhigher than P75,000 are considered out of poverty and labeled 1, and those below the \npoverty threshold labeled 0. We considered a number of independent variables including \ndemographic variables. In this estimation, we expect that remittance will pull households \nout of poverty.  In Table 6, the results show that the coefficient of actual remittance \nreceived is positive, indicating that remittance has a positive impact in pulling households \nout of poverty. Among other variables, the ratio of employed members to total members \nreflected a negative sign.

Summary and Conclusions \n\nThe Philippines is among the world\u2019s top recipients of remittances, which have contributed \nsignificantly to its foreign currency inflows in tranquil and turbulent times. These flows \nsupported the economy during the normal and crisis situations in the past, and seem to \nremain so in the future. While developing Asia was at the epicenter of the 1997 financial \ncrisis, the crisis did not touch migrant-hosting countries outside the region. However, the \ncurrent global crisis has adversely affected economies the world over, including those \nsending remittances from outside Asia. This has brought a new challenge to the role of \nremittances through slowdown in economic growth and in the global demand for goods \nand labor, and spiraling unemployment in host countries. The jobs of Filipino workers \nand their remittance transfers are therefore at risk. In particular, demand for low-skilled \nworkers may weaken if the global crisis drags on. In the short term, remittances may \nprovide a safety net that could protect households from the current global economic \ncrisis. Over a longer time period, these flows could supplement social protection systems \nand contribute to economic development by sustaining objectives such as those of the \nMillennium Development Goals. This paper analyzed the role that remittances play in \nthe Philippine economy with a view to understanding the contribution that they make in \nsupporting households, lifting domestic demand, and rebalancing growth.\n\nThrough the Philippines\u2019s labor export strategy, the profile of Filipino migrants has \nchanged over time, from mostly middle- and lower-skilled workers to the oil-rich countries \nof the Middle East in the early 1970s; to an increase in demand for professional workers \nincluding nurses and caregivers in the 1990s following the growth of labor-importing tiger \neconomies in Asia and changing social patterns in the West; to a substantial decline \nin the professional category in recent years from 2006. Lower salaried services and \nconstruction workers are currently supporting the sustained level of remittance inflows. \nThe countries exhibiting declines in remittance inflows had been the top labor markets \nfor the Philippines in the last two decades, namely, Saudi Arabia; Hong Kong, China; \nSingapore; Qatar; Kuwait; and Taipei,China. A sustained decline in their inflows will mean \nan eventual decline in overall remittances. \n\nThere is international evidence that households receiving remittances in general spend \nless at the margin on consumption goods like food and more on investment goods like \neducation and housing. Although remittances accrue directly to households with migrant \nmembers, families that do not receive remittances can also benefit indirectly from these \ntransfers, thus promoting local development through spillovers. These flows may also \ncontribute to the creation of new social assets and services and community physical \ninfrastructure such as schools, health centers, roads, and other community projects. \nHowever, there may also be substantial economic and social costs associated with these \ntransfers. \n\n\f\u0018\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 188\n\nThis study utilized FIES 2000, 2003, and 2006 data to analyze the role of remittances \nin household consumption, investment, and poverty reduction. The data show that \nabout one fifth of all Filipino households receive remittances, and this fraction has been \nrising over time. However, while less than 10% of lower income households receive \nremittances, the proportion increases with income. These flows from abroad contribute \nas much as 15% to the incomes of the highest income quintile but just over 1% for \nthe poorest quintile. The recipient households generally have larger families and fewer \nemployed members than nonrecipients, reflecting higher dependency ratio as a factor in \nattracting remittances. The latter depend significantly more on wages and entrepreneurial \nincome. Remittance-receiving households also earn more from their investments and \nsave more than their nonreceiving counterparts. \n\nPrevious studies on the effects of international remittances on household expenditures \nin the Philippines, in general, do not take into account the reverse causality that occurs \nwhen, for instance, remittances help reduce household poverty, but at the same time, the \nlevel of poverty may also influence the amount of remittances received by a household. \nIgnoring reverse causality in investigating the impact of remittances on households \nmight lead to erroneous conclusions. This paper addresses this issue in analyzing \nthe relationship between remittances and household expenditure on consumption and \ninvestment to evaluate the extent to which the propensity to spend differs between \ndifferent items. To account for the endogeneity bias this paper identifies instrumental \nvariables for remittances and uses a two stage least squares procedure to estimate the \nmodel.\n\nThe results show that it is only for food share that the coefficient of the remittance dummy \nis statistically significant. It is negative indicating that the share of expenditure on food is \non average lower for households receiving remittances. Moreover, the marginal propensity \nto consume food is higher for remittance receiving households. Unlike the previous \nstudies however, our estimations show that remittances to the Philippines do not have a \nsignificant influence on other items of expenditure, particularly investment spending on \neducation, health care, and durable goods. In other words, the analysis in this paper does \nnot support evidence of remittances contributing toward rebalancing growth by creating \ndomestic demand.\n\n\fRemittances and Household Behavior in the Philippines  | \u0018\u0018\n\nReferences\n\nAcosta, P. 2006.

They find \nthat although remittances negatively influence the share of food consumption, they have \nno significant effect on other key items of household expenditure like education and \nhealth care. Their analysis shows that although remittances may reduce poverty, there is \nnot enough evidence to support that they can contribute toward rebalancing growth by \ncreating domestic demand.  \n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their \npeople. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two thirds of the world\u2019s \npoor: 1.8 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less \nthan $1.25 a day.  ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic \ngrowth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. \n     Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\n\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/economics\nISSN: 1655-5252\nPublication Stock No. \n\nPrinted in the Philippines\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 188\n", "Remittances and Household Behavior  \nin the Philippines\n", "Alvin P.
