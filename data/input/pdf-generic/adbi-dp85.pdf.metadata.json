We find that compared with the 1990s, the expansive trend of inter-provincial \ndisparities has slowed down and started to decrease somewhat since 2000. In 2004 and \n2005,  some  statistical  indicators,  such  as  per  capita  GDP  and  per  capita  household \nconsumption at current prices, show that regional disparities have declined to a certain \nextent. In addition to the great disparity among provinces, disparities within provinces are \nalso very common in the PRC. Judged by some measurement indexes, income disparities \nwithin many provinces have even exceeded inter-provincial disparities. \nThe results of decomposing the regional disparity into within-group and between-group \ncomponents suggested that the urban-rural disparities are the main source of regional \ndisparities. The results further suggested that disparities among the PRC\u2019s four regions, \nespecially between the eastern region and the other regions, are mainly to blame for inter-\nprovincial disparities.  \nFinally, this paper finds that changes in regional disparities in recent years can be attributed \nto many factors, including policies and regional specific factors as well as some cyclical \nfactors. For this reason, we still cannot claim that the PRC\u2019s regional disparities have started \na decline that will continue.  \nJEL Classification: O18, R12, O47 \n ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \nContents \n \n \nIntroduction  1 \nSurvey of Literature Related to Regional Disparity in the PRC  1 \nIndexes Measuring Regional Income  2 \nRegional Disparities among the Four Regions in the PRC  4 \nInter-provincial Disparities in the PRC  7 \nA.

Even Guizhou province, with the lowest GDP per capita, has experienced \nan eleven-fold increase in economic output from 1978 to 2005, with the annual economic \ngrowth rate averaging 9.5% at constant prices. GDP per capita increased from 175 yuan in \n1978 to 5,052 yuan in 2005; this is nearly eight-fold growth with an average annual growth \nrate of 8.6% at constant prices.  \nHowever, the PRC is a large developing country with a huge population and a tremendous \namount of territory. Among the regions, the natural endowments as well as economic and \nsocial conditions differ greatly. These differences predispose the PRC to having regional \nimbalances. This regional disparity is one of the crucial issues faced by the PRC in its \nmedium- and long-term development. It is also a core problem that the PRC must solve to \nachieve coordinated regional development. In-depth study of the regional income disparity in \nthe PRC is necessary for this effort. \nIn the 1990s, continuously growing regional disparity raised concern among the government \nand society. Many scholars undertook rigorous study of various aspects of the regional \ndisparity. Most of these studies focused on the problems of disparity among provinces; \nrelatively little systematic study has investigated disparity within each province.  \nThe PRC\u2019s provinces are large and populous. Seven of its provinces or autonomous regions \nhave land areas that exceed 400 thousand square kilometers; nine of its provinces have \npopulations over 50 million, and three of those provinces\u2019 populations exceed 90 million. \nBecause the provinces cover such expansive areas and contain such large populations, a \nvariety of differing conditions exist within each province. Therefore, study that focuses only \non the issue of disparity among provinces cannot accurately reflect the situation of regional \ndisparity in the PRC.  \nThe unique feature of this paper is that it includes analysis of regional disparity not only \namong the provinces of the PRC, but also within them. The analysis is based on recent \nupdated statistical data that has become available since the PRC implemented its first \nnational economic census in 2004. The regions adjusted their historical economic data in \naccordance with the result of this national economic census, these adjusted data reflect the \nregion\u2019s economic conditions more precisely.  \nSURVEY OF LITERATURE RELATED TO REGIONAL DISPARITY IN THE PRC \nMany studies have examined the trends of change in inequality among the PRC\u2019s regions. \nMost of these studies found that regional disparity measured in terms of GDP per capita \ndeclined significantly from 1978 to 1990, the first stage of the PRC\u2019s reform and opening \n(Jian, Sachs, and Warner, 1996; Lin and Liu, 2003; Dayal-Gulati and Husain, 2000; Li, Feng, \nand Hou, 2004). Many of these studies recognized that the decline in regional disparity was \ndue mainly to the character of the rural reform in this stage. The reform heavily promoted the \ngrowth of agricultural production, so the underdeveloped rural areas\u2014which initially had per \ncapita outputs lower than the national average\u2014benefited highly from the reform.  \nHowever, a trend of continuous regional disparity has emerged since the 1990s (Wang and \nFan, 2004; Kanbur and Zhang, 2005). This is mainly due to the increase of disparity between \n ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \nthe coastal area and provinces in the inland. Wu (2004) studied the impact on regional \ndisparity of three centrally administered municipalities: Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. He \ndiscovered that regional disparity in the PRC is reduced greatly if the data of these three \ncentrally administered municipalities are excluded. Due to the unique features of these three \nmunicipalities, it is meaningless to compare the data of these three municipalities with that of \nother provinces in the PRC. Therefore, incorrect results will be obtained if these three \nmunicipalities are studied together with other provinces. More recently, Xu and Li (2006) \ndiscovered that although the PRC\u2019s regional disparity has risen continuously since 1990, the \nrate of this increase has declined since the year 2000. \nSome studies have found that the PRC\u2019s urban-rural disparities constitute the main part of \nthe overall disparities. Using urban and rural household consumption data of 28 provinces \nexclusive of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai between 1983 and 1995, Kanbur and Zhang \n(1999)  found  that  urban-rural  disparities  accounted  for  70%  of  the  overall  regional \ndisparities. Yang and Zhou (1999) also provide some evidence of widening urban-rural \nincome disparities. Some other studies have discovered that disparities between coastal and \ninland regions or among eastern, central, and western regions have been expanding rapidly \nsince the PRC\u2019s reform and opening up. By decomposing the Gini coefficient, Yao and \nZhang  (2001)  showed  that  the  proportion  accounted  for  by  disparities  among  eastern, \ncentral, and western regions has risen to nearly 80% since 1990. Wang and Zhang (2006) \nadopted the Theil_L index decomposition technique and also discovered that disparities \namong eastern, central, and western regions have grown continuously and represented \nabout 77% of the overall disparities in the PRC in 2001. \nSince its reform and opening up, geographic, institutional, and some other factors have \nplayed important roles in changes of the PRC\u2019s regional disparities. Wang (2004) found that \ntownship and village enterprises (TVEs), education, and capital investment were among \nimportant  factors  determining  income  disparities  in  rural  areas.  Wang  and  Fan  (2004) \ndiscovered that FDI, governmental transfer payment, and labor migration have affected the \nchanging of the PRC\u2019s regional disparities. Peng (2005) examined the regional divergence of \ngrowth  in  the  PRC  from  the  perspective  of  sectors  (such  as  agriculture,  industry, \nconstruction, transport and post and other tertiary industries) from 1990 to 2002 and found \nlarge heterogeneity in productivity levels and movements across sectors and provinces. \nDecomposing aggregate divergence into within and between sector components revealed \nthat the secondary and tertiary industrial sectors contributed to 87% of the total divergence. \nKanbur and Zhang (2005) showed that regional disparities can be explained by three key \npolicy  variables:  the  ratio  of  heavy  industry  to  gross  output  value,  the  degree  of \ndecentralization, and the degree of openness. Some other studies (Litwack and Qian, 1998; \nYoung, 2000; Demurger, 2001; Demurger et al., 2002; Yang, 2002; Renard, 2002) have \nfound that factors including the PRC\u2019s regional development strategies, preferential policies \nin favor of cities, SOE reform, fiscal decentralization, and public infrastructure all contribute \nto the expansion of regional disparities. Li, Feng, and Hou (2004) and Poncet (2005) also \ninvestigated the PRC\u2019s regional protectionism and market integration. Young (2000) showed \nthat market segmentation has aggravated the growing trend of regional disparities because \nthe lack of a uniform market has a weaker negative impact on coastal areas than on their \ninland counterparts. \nINDEXES MEASURING REGIONAL INCOME  \nMany indicators can reflect regional income. The following three are usually adopted to \nmeasure the PRC\u2019s regional disparities. \n(1) Per capita GDP. Per capita GDP is the most frequently used index. It reflects one \nregion\u2019s production capacity, income, and economic development level. Compared with \n2 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \nother indexes, statistics on per capita GDP are relatively complete and perfect.1 However, \nthis index alone cannot fully capture the welfare enjoyed by people in one region because \nthis  welfare  is  directly  determined  by  a  combination  of  many  other  factors  including \nhousehold incomes, regional prices, and public services. Although household incomes are \nclosely related to per capita GDP, the two are not completely consistent due to transfers of \nfactor incomes and transfer payments among regions. \n(2) Per capita consumption (household consumption level). Compared with per capita \nGDP,  per  capita  consumption  can  better  reflect  household  living  conditions.  GDP \nexpenditure  is  composed  of  capital  formation,  consumption,  and  net  export,  while \nconsumption can be further decomposed into governmental and household consumption. \nThe shares of capital formation, consumption, and net export may be different in different \nregions, and so are proportions of government and household consumption. For example, all \nprovinces in the western region have net inflows while most provinces in the eastern region \n(except Beijing) have net outflows because there are some transfer payments between the \ncentral  government  and  provincial  governments,  and  the  existence  of  large  transfer \npayments  from  more  developed  to  less  developed  regions.  Therefore,  household \nconsumption level is the most direct measurement of household living standards. \n(3) Household income. Household income is the main determinant of household living \nstandards  and  quality  of  life.  This  index  can  directly  reflect  the  welfare  enjoyed  by \nhouseholds. In the PRC, household income is measured by urban per capita disposable \nincome and rural per capita net income. The data of household income directly come from \nhousehold survey statistics produced by survey teams of the National Bureau of Statistics. \nPer capita GDP, household income, and per capita consumption reflect regional income \nlevel  and  household  welfare  level  in  different  ways,  so  regional  disparities  based  on \ncalculations of these three indexes are somewhat different. There are great differences in \nconsumption rates among different regions. For example, the per capita GDP of Zhejiang \n(27,703 yuan) was 5.48 times that of Guizhou (5,052 yuan) in 2005, while the share of \nhousehold consumption in GDP was 35% for Zhejiang and 62.1% for Guizhou (see Figure \n1). The household consumption level of Zhejiang was 3.09 times that of Guizhou, indicating \nthat the regional disparity measured by consumption per capita is significantly less than that \nmeasured by per capita GDP. On the whole, the household consumption rate in the more \ndeveloped eastern regions (an average of 33.2% in 2005) is relatively low while the index is \nrelatively high in other regions (an average of 40.4% in 2005). Therefore, it can be safely \nconcluded that regional disparity based on per capita consumption is less than that based on \nper capita GDP. \n                                                 \n1 For example, many other indexes such as household consumption level and household income are not \navailable at the prefecture or county level. \n3 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \nFigure 1.

Calculations using the latter can produce \nlower  results  than  the  former  because  of  the  low  marginal  propensity  to  consume  for \nhouseholds with higher incomes. However, there is some variation between local household \nconsumption level and actual consumption level in large cities like Beijing and Shanghai \nbecause statistics on the PRC\u2019s household consumption per capita come from the national \nincome account, which reflects households\u2019 purchases of goods and services. In these large \ncities, purchases made by citizens from other regions account for a considerable proportion \nof total retail sales of consumer goods and services.  \nBecause there are some differences among results calculated using the three indexes, an \nintegrated analysis should be conducted to include all these indexes and reflect regional \ndisparities in a comprehensive manner. However, due to limitations in the data availability, \nwe have chosen to use per capita GDP, household income, and household consumption per \ncapita for measuring regional disparities at the provincial level, and use only per capita GDP \nfor the prefecture and county levels. \nREGIONAL DISPARITIES AMONG THE FOUR REGIONS IN THE PRC \nGreat differences exist in terms of geography, resources, economic and social development, \nand culture between the PRC\u2019s coastal and inland regions. Since 1986 (the beginning of the \nSeventh Five-Year Plan) many studies have revealed obvious disparities among the eastern, \ncentral, and western regions in the PRC. In this paper we first analyze disparities among the \nfour regions differentiated in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan.2 The eastern region is more \ndeveloped, with less than 9.6% of the nation\u2019s total area, more than 30% of the nation\u2019s total \npopulation, and over 40% of the total output. Table 1 shows the shares of population and \nGDP of the four regions. \nAs shown in Table 1, the share of output of the eastern region has risen from 43.8% in 1980 \nto 55.6% in 2005, with an increase of 11.8 percentage points over 25 years. Accordingly, the \nshares of output of other regions have declined somewhat since the PRC\u2019s reform and the \nopening up of its economy. From 1978 to 2005, the share of GDP of the central region \n                                                 \n2 Appendix A presents the Chinese administrative system and illustrates the division of the PRC\u2019s regions. \n4 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \ndropped by 3.5 percentage points, while the shares of the western and northeastern regions \nshrank by 3.3 and 5 percentage points, respectively. \nTable 1.

The  population  growth  rate  of  the  eastern  region  is  higher  mainly  because  of \npopulation migration across regions. But the increase in the share of population of the \neastern region has been much smaller than the increase in its share of GDP, indicating that \nlabor movement across regions is relatively slow. \nFigure 2 shows that per capita GDP in the northeastern region was higher than that of the \neastern region in the late 1970s. The ratio of per capita GDP in the northeastern region to \nthat in the eastern region declined from 1.2 in 1978 to 1 in 1990; and the ratios of per capita \nGDP in the central and western regions to the eastern region also declined, but on a smaller \nscale, from 0.627 and 0.563 in 1978 to 0.567 and 0.529 in 1990, respectively. In the 1990s \nthe gap between the eastern region and the other regions increased. The ratios of per capita \nGDP of the northeastern, central, and western regions to the eastern region in 1991 were \n0.97, 0.52, and 0.51, respectively, and they decreased to 0.76, 0.45, and 0.40, respectively, \nin 2000. After 2000, the changes in these ratios were smaller than they were in the 1990s. In \n2005 the ratios of per capita GDP of the northeastern, central, and western regions to the \neastern region were 0.66, 0.44, and 0.39, respectively. Compared with 2000, the ratios of \nthe central and western regions have been stable in recent years.  \nFigure 2.

In 1978, the ratio of maximum to minimum value of per capita GDP was \n2.14. There were almost no changes in the ratio in the 1980s and it reached its lowest point \nof 1.91 in 1990. But the ratio has been on the rise since 1990 and reached 2.58 in 2005, with \nper capita GDP of 24,024 yuan for the eastern region. In sum, disparities among the four \nregions measured in terms of changes in the ratio of maximum to minimum value of per \ncapita GDP have been rising since the reform and opening up of the economy. However, the \nratios of maximum to minimum value of per capita GDP were 2.57 and 2.58 in 2004 and \n2005 respectively, suggesting that that the income disparity among the four regions has \nstabilized. Results of the Theil index show similar trends (see Figure 3).  \nFigure 3.

Beginning in 1990, however, the \nper capita GDP growth rate of the eastern region accelerated. Especially in the early part of \nthe  1990s  its  growth  rate  was  much  higher  than  those  of  the  central,  western,  and \nnortheastern regions. For example, the growth rates of per capita GDP in the eastern, \ncentral,  western,  and  northeastern  regions  were  13.69%,  10.53%,  9.59%,  and  8.59% \nrespectively  from  1990  to  1997;  the  growth  rate  in  the  eastern  region  was  3.1\u20135.1 \npercentage points higher than those in the other regions. After 2000, the eastern region \nmaintained a higher growth rate, but the difference between it and the other regions has \nnarrowed.  The  growth  rates  of  per  capita  GDP  in  the  eastern,  central,  western,  and \nnortheastern regions were 11.48%, 10.86%, 10.89%, and 10.64% respectively from 2000 to \n2005; the differences were only 0.6\u20130.8 percentage point. As a result the income disparity \namong the four regions remains stable. \nIn short, there was declining regional disparity among the four regions of the PRC in the \n1980s, which was mainly due to the continuous decline of regional disparity between the \nnortheastern and eastern regions. In the 1990s, especially in the first half of the 1990s, there \nwas a significant widening of the gap among the four regions. This was mainly due to the \nextraordinarily high economic growth rate of the eastern region compared to the other \nregions. Since 2000, although there is still growth of the disparities among the four regions, \nthe rate of increase has become relatively smooth. Disparities in per capita GDP among the \nfour regions were stable in 2003, 2004, and 2005. \n6 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \nFigure 4.

For example, in 2004 GDP was considered to be 1.369 \ntrillion yuan before the census, and was adjusted to 1.599 trillion based on the results of the \ncensus. The adjusted GDP was 17.8% higher than the non-adjusted figure. All regions made \nadjustments to their historical economic data in accordance with the result of this national \neconomic census. For example, in 2004 GDP in Beijing, Shanxi, and Guangdong were \nadjusted upward by 41.5%, 17.4%, and 17.4%, respectively, and that in Heilongjiang, Hubei, \nand  Guangxi  were  adjusted  downward  by  10.4%,  4.8%,  and  10.7%,  respectively.  The \nadjusted data reflect the economic conditions of the regions more accurately. In this paper, \nour analysis is based upon the adjusted data, which is based on the results of this national \neconomic census.     \nA.  Trend of Inter-provincial Income Disparity  \n1.  Changes in regional disparities measured by ratio of maximum to \nminimum values \nThe ratio of maximum to minimum values of income (Max/Min, or MMR) can describe \nregional disparities. We first conduct a simple analysis of regional disparities using this \nmeasure.3 \nAt the beginning of the reform and opening up of the economy, regional disparities in the \nPRC were relatively large. In 1978, the per capita GDP of Shanghai was 2,497 yuan, almost \n14.2 times that of Guizhou province, with the lowest per capita GDP. As indicated by Figure \n5, the ratio of maximum to minimum per capita GDP decreased from 14.2 in 1978 to 7.3 in \n1990, rose to 13.0 in 2000, and stayed relatively stable thereafter. But that has not been the \ncase  with  per  capita  consumption.  Inter-provincial  disparities  in  terms  of  per  capita \nconsumption have been generally on the rise since the 1980s, but after 1999, the level \nremained very stable. In 2005, both the ratio of maximum to minimum per capita GDP and \nper capita consumption declined compared with those of the previous year.  \n                                                 \n3 Appendix B presents the measures of regional disparities used in this paper. \n7 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \nFigure 5.

They are highly developed and have low \nproportions of rural population.4 Thus, the three cities are not easily comparable with other \nprovinces or autonomous regions. Data shown in Figure 6 do not include these three \nmunicipal cities. The ratio of maximum to minimum per capita GDP among the provinces, \nexcluding the three municipalities mentioned, is smaller than that among all of the provinces. \nFor example, the ratio of maximum to minimum per capita GDP among all of the provinces in \n1978 was 14.3, and that among the provinces excluding these three municipal cities was \n3.9, and in 2005 they were 13.4 and 5.5, respectively.  \nFigure 6 also depicts changes in the ratio of maximum to minimum values of per capita GDP \namong the provinces excluding the three municipalities. The data show that the trend of the \nchange in regional disparities among the 28 provinces and autonomous regions (excluding \nthe three centrally administrated municipalities) is similar to the regional disparities among \nthe four regions. There has been a slight decline of regional disparity among the provinces \nand autonomous regions since the reform and opening up of the economy in the late 1970s \nup to 1990. The maximum to minimum ratio rose to 4.86 in 2000, reached the peak of 5.64 \nin 2004, and then declined in 2005. A similar trend is shown in the maximum to minimum \nratio of per capita household consumption. \n                                                 \n4 Urbanization rates of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai in 2005 were 82%, 73%, and 89%, respectively, while the \naverage urbanization rate of the whole nation was only 43%, and their per capita GDP (2006) ranked second, \nthird, and first in 31 provinces respectively. \n8 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \nFigure 6.

In the same time \nperiod, there were declines of 12% and 33.4% for the weighted Gini coefficients and Theil \nindex, respectively, based on per capita GDP. The results based on 1978 constant prices \nare quite similar, but the amount of decrease is smaller. The unweighted Gini coefficients \nand  Theil  index  decreased  by  6.1%  and  6.3%,  respectively,  and  the  weighted  Gini \ncoefficients increased by 0.9%.  \nIn the 1990s inter-provincial income disparity grew rapidly. The unweighted Gini coefficients \nbased on per capita GDP at current prices increased from 0.276 in 1990 to 0.347 in 2000\u2014\nan increase of 25.7% with an average annual growth rate of 2.3%. The weighted Gini \ncoefficients and Theil index based on per capita GDP increased by 25.8% and 57.6%, \nrespectively. \nCompared with the 1990s, the widening of regional disparities in the PRC has gradually \nslowed down since 2000. The unweighted Gini coefficients based on per capita GDP at \ncurrent prices increased from 0.347 in 2000 to 0.349 in 2005\u2014a difference of only 0.5%. \nCompared with the previous year, this index as well as some other indexes decreased in \n2004 and 2005.   \nFigures 9 and 10 show changes in inter-provincial disparities in terms of per capita GDP, \nagain exclusive of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, at current and constant prices (1978 = \nbase year), respectively. The calculations excluding the three cities yield smaller disparities \nthan calculations including all of the provinces. For example, the range of unweighted Gini \ncoefficients based on per capita GDP at current prices among the 31 provinces is between \n0.276 and 0.356, but that among the provinces excluding these three cities is between 0.15 \nand 0.231.

The  income  disparity  among  the  28  provinces  and \nautonomous regions (excluding the three centrally administrated municipalities) is relatively \nsmall and the change is relatively stable. The Gini coefficient fluctuated between 0.22 and \n0.23. \nB.  Spatial Decomposition of Inter-provincial Disparities \nIn order to explore the spatial distribution of inter-provincial disparities in the PRC, we will \napply the group decomposition technique in the following analysis. \n11 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \nFigure 11.

The disparity \namong the provinces and autonomous regions is mainly caused by the disparity among the \nfour regions. The disparity within the eastern region has a share around 20% of overall \ndisparity,  while  in  the  rest  of  the  PRC,  the  disparity  within  the  western,  central,  and \nnortheastern regions all together have only a share of 10% of overall disparity. Also, the \ndecline in regional disparity of the PRC during the period 1978\u20131990 was mainly due to the \nsignificant decline of internal disparity within the eastern region. In 1978, the internal Theil \nindex of the eastern region was 0.055, which constitutes a share of 49.8% of the national \ntotal Theil index (0.110). In 1990, the internal Theil index of the eastern region constituted a \nshare of 26.6% of the national total\u2014a decline of 23.2 percentage points. The absolute value \nof the national Theil index declined by 0.037, and the absolute value of the internal Theil \nindex of the eastern region declined by 0.035, which makes for a share of 96% of the decline \nof the national Theil index. Therefore, it can be said that the change in eastern internal \nregional disparity can explain in large part the change of the regional disparity of the whole \ncountry.  \nFigures 12, 13, 14, and 15 show the distribution of the PRC\u2019s provinces and autonomous \nregions according to their level of development in terms of per capita GDP in 1978, 1990, \n2000, and 2005, respectively. In 1978, there was large difference in the level of development \nin the eastern region. Among the ten provinces in this region, only Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai \nmunicipalities and Jiangsu province had achieved relatively higher per capita GDP, while \nZhejiang, Shandong, Hainan, and Fujian provinces were ranked in the medium and lower \nlevels of per capita GDP of the PRC. Qinghai province ranked seventh in the PRC at that \ntime.   \n                                                 \n5  The decomposition method is described in part 3 of Appendix B \n12 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \nFigure 12.

Our subsequent analysis also uses this \napproach. \nSource: Data of Gross Domestic Product of China: 1952-2004 \nIn 1990, there were significant increases in the ranks of Guangdong, Zhejiang, Shandong, \nHainan, and Fujian provinces. Nearly all provinces in the eastern region achieved relatively \nhigher per capita GDP except Hubei, Fujian, and Hainan. Therefore, internal disparity was \nreduced significantly. In 1990, Xinjiang province in the western region was ranked among \nthe top ten in the PRC. Qinghai and Tibet were among the middle ten. In the year 2000, no \nprovince of the western region ranked in the top ten (see Figure 14), But Inner Mongolia, in \nthe western region, entered the top ten in 2005. \nFigure 13. Economic Development Level of All Provinces in PRC in 1990 \nLow per capita GDP Regions   (10)\nMedium per capita GDP Regions  (10)\nHigh per capita GDP Regions   (10)  \nSource: Data of Gross Domestic Product of China:1952-2004 \nSince 1990, the continuous widening of disparities among the four regions is to blame for the \nexpansion of regional disparities. During this period, the process of the PRC\u2019s reform and \nopening up of its economy have further advanced, the economic growth rates of the more \ndeveloped eastern provinces have been higher than the nation\u2019s average level, and all the \neastern provinces except Hebei and Hainan have become high per capita GDP regions (see \nFigure 14). Figure 14 also shows that not one province of the western region was in the top \nten in 2000. Therefore, disparities between the eastern region and other regions have grown \nfurther. The internal disparities of the four regions have changed modestly from 1990 to \n2005, but the between-group Theil index, reflecting disparities among the four regions, has \nincreased by 0.044 from 0.045 in 1990 to 0.089 in 2005, which accounts for 86.3% of the \nchange of the nation\u2019s Theil index (this index increased from 0.081 to 0.124).  \n13 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \nFigure 14.

Disparities among the four regions accounted for 71.8% of the total disparities \nin 2005. The share of internal disparities of the eastern region was 17.1%, and the share \nwas 8.7% for internal disparities of the western region and 2.3% for internal disparities of \nboth the central region and the northeastern region. \nC.  Factor Analysis of Regional Income Disparity \nChanges in regional income disparity can be caused by differences in regional economic \ngrowth rates. If high-income provinces grow faster than the national average, the inter-\nregional income disparity can expand; if low-income provinces grow faster, the inter-regional \nincome disparity will narrow.  \n1.  Changes in patterns of regional growth and regional disparities \nFigures 16 and 17 describe the regional growth patterns in 1990\u20132000 and 2000\u20132005, \nrespectively.  After  the  PRC  began  its  reform  and  opening  up,  the  average  speed  of \ndevelopment in the eastern region was higher than in the other regions because the coastal \nregion had a favorable investment environment, an abundant supply of labor, and was \nopened to the outside world earlier than the rest of the country. This trend became more \ntangible after the 1990s. In Figure 16, many provinces of the eastern region are located in \nthe upper-right part of the figure (with higher incomes and higher growth rates), while many \n14 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \nprovinces of the western and central regions are located in the lower-left part (with lower \nincomes and lower growth rates). This resulted directly in widening regional disparities in the \nPRC in the 1980s. \nFigure 16.

Not only did some low-income regions such as Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Qinghai, \nand Shanxi post growth rates higher than the national average, other regions whose per \ncapita GDP was relatively low also saw a narrower gap between their growth rates and the \nnational average level than in the 1990s. Comparing Figures 16 and 17, we can find that the \nnumber of provinces located in the lower-left part of the figure (with lower incomes and lower \ngrowth rates) decreased, and number of provinces located in upper-left part (with lower \nincomes and higher growth rates) increased. As a result, the widening of regional disparities \nin the PRC has gradually slowed down since 2000. \nFigure 17.

As indicated in Table 2, five provinces saw lower growth rates \nin 2003\u20132005 when compared with the average growth rates in the 1990s. Except for Hubei, \nall of these provinces had per capita GDP levels higher than the national average. The other \n26 provinces and municipalities saw higher growth rates in 2003\u20132005 than in the 1990s. In \nparticular, Tianjin, Shanxi, Jiangxi, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, and \nQinghai saw fairly quickly rising growth rates. Of these eight provinces and municipalities, six \n(except Tianjin and Liaoning) were noted for relatively low per capita GDP. Therefore, the \ngrowth rates in 2003\u20132005 slowed down somewhat in the developed regions and gained \nmomentum  in  the  less  developed  regions.

As a \nresult, the widening of regional disparities has slowed down.  \nThe factors that led to the changes in the growth pattern and regional disparities included \nboth policies and the macroeconomic environment. Among these the following five factors \nare assumed to be the more important and effective. \n1. The implementation of the Western Area Development Strategy and revitalization of old \nindustrial bases in the northeast has effectively promoted economic growth in these regions \nand eased widening regional disparities. \nThe central government decided in 1999 to implement the Western Area Development \nStrategy. As a result, the state dramatically increased funding for construction in the western \nregion. From 2000 to 2003, the central government spent more than 360 billion yuan in fiscal \nconstruction on the development of the western region. In particular, more than 220 billion \nyuan in long-term government bonds were issued for this purpose. In addition, the financial \ninstitutions in the western region increased their loan balance by more than 950 billion yuan. \nThe state launched 50 new key projects in the western region, with a total investment of 730 \nbillion yuan. In 2004, the PRC launched another 10 key projects for the development of the \nwestern region, with a total investment of 80 billion yuan. During 2000\u20132004, the central \ngovernment allocated a total of about 460 billion yuan in fiscal construction funds for the \nwestern region, of which more than one-third was raised through government bonds issued \nfor the western region. The central government also earmarked about 500 billion yuan in \n16 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \nterms  of  fiscal  transfer  payments  and  special  subsidies.  In  October  2003  the  central \ngovernment began to implement policies to revitalize economic and social development in \nold northeastern industrial bases. Since then the economic growth of three provinces in the \nnortheastern region has accelerated. Table 3 indicates that from 2000 to 2005, the eastern \nregion\u2019s share of nationwide investment dropped, and the central and western regions\u2019 \nshares increased. \nTable 3.

In the early 1980s, the investment rates were largely \nidentical across the PRC\u2019s four regions. In the late 1980s, however, the state introduced an \nasymmetrical development strategy to allow some regions to get rich first and then let the \nricher regions help the poorer ones get rich. As a result, the coastal region benefited from \nsystem innovation and liberalization. While domestic investment began pouring into the \neastern  coastal  region,  foreign  investment  also  became  concentrated  in  this  region. \nAccordingly, the investment rate rose dramatically in the eastern region and remained low in \nother regions, with the eastern region\u2019s investment rate being 7\u20138 percentage points higher \nthan those of other regions. In the first half of the 1990s, the eastern region\u2019s investment rate \nwas  about  12  percentage  points  higher  than  that  of  the  central  region  and  about  10 \npercentage points higher than those of the western and northeastern regions. But after 2000, \nthe western region\u2019s rate of investment in fixed assets rose visibly and surpassed that of the \neastern region. In 2004, the western region\u2019s average investment rate was 49.8 percent, \nwhich was higher than the eastern region\u2019s 42.1 percent, the central region\u2019s 39 percent, and \nthe northeastern region\u2019s 36.9. Intensive investment spurred rapid economic growth in the \nwestern region and a rise in the income level of the local people. Clearly, the implementation \nof the Western Area Development Strategy has played an important role in narrowing \nregional disparities. \n2. The regions with rich resources have seen their GDP growing faster with economic growth \nsince 2002. \nThe PRC\u2019s economy entered a new round of rapid growth in 2002. Compared with the \npreceding years, nearly all regions saw their economies grow faster.  \nIn fact, nationwide shortages occurred in the coal, electricity, oil, and transport sectors from \n2002 to 2004, with price levels persistently climbing. The price levels of coal and crude oil \nrose particularly fast. In 2004, the ex-factory price index for the PRC\u2019s mining industry was \n17 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \n129.3, far higher than the consumer price index (102.4) and the ex-factory price index for \nindustrial  goods  (107.1).  Steep  hikes  in  energy  prices  boosted  the  outputs  of  various \nproducing regions and directly increased their total output values. They also attracted heavy \ninvestment in these sectors, thus pulling up economic growth in the regions where they were \nlocated.  Table  2  suggests  that  Tianjin,  Shanxi,  Jiangxi,  Liaoning,  Heilongjiang,  Inner \nMongolia, Shaanxi, Qinghai, and Shandong were the places where growth rates were fairly \nfast over the two years. Except for Tianjin, all these places have one thing in common: they \nall enjoy comparative advantage in resource industries (mainly coal, oil, and natural gas). \nTherefore, we can say that the narrowing of regional disparities in recent years was spurred \nby the rapid growth of the resource (energy) industries in this new round of economic \ngrowth. \n3. The pulling effect of foreign direct investment eased somewhat in the eastern coastal \nregion. \n   Compared with local capital investment, investment from outside a region has a \nmore tangible pulling effect on that region\u2019s economic growth because it does not squeeze \nlocal consumption. In particular, foreign direct investment not only provides direct funding \nsupport, but also brings to the local economy higher levels of technology and management \nexpertise. Therefore, such investment helps increase the competitiveness and growth rate of \nthe regional economy. In the 1990s, foreign direct investment on average accounted for a \nvisibly higher proportion of total investment in the eastern region than in the central and \nwestern regions. But after 2000, the ratio of foreign direct investment acquired by the \neastern region compared to local GDP declined slightly. The ratio was 8.6 percent in 1995, \nbut dropped to 5.3 percent and 4.4 percent respectively in 2000 and 2004, or 3.3 and 4.2 \npercentage points lower than in 1995. Compared with 1995, the ratios for the central, \nwestern, and northeastern regions went down by 0.15, 1.0, and 0.06 percentage points \nrespectively in 2004. This is an indication that the contribution of foreign direct investment \ndeclined somewhat in all regions after 2000. But the fall was more dramatic in the eastern \nregion. Experience tells us that foreign direct investment can better promote the growth of \nthe regional economy than domestic investment does. That is why the decline in foreign \ndirect investment dampened the economic growth advantage of the eastern region over the \ncentral and western regions and hence eased the widening gap of regional disparities. \n4. Less developed regions saw infrastructure construction advance rapidly. \nInfrastructure development is a crucial factor for the speed of development of a regional \neconomy. The development of infrastructure\u2014including transport, communications, water \ncontrol, and power infrastructure\u2014can raise productivity, reduce costs, and help attract \nforeign investment and accelerate economic development. A region\u2019s geographic location, \ntransport conditions, and telecom facilities strongly indicate disparities in regional economic \ndevelopment,  and  a  policy  in  favor  of  balanced  infrastructure  development  can  help \neconomic convergence among different regions. In the PRC, the infrastructure in the eastern \ncoastal region has always been better than that in inland regions because of historical, \neconomic, and geographic disparities. Since the beginning of the reform and opening up of \nthe economy, the development of infrastructure in the eastern coastal region has also been \nfaster than in the rest of the country. In recent years, however, its speed of growth in the \neastern coastal region has declined somewhat because the infrastructure there is already \nrelatively complete. At the same time, the central and western regions have seen their \ninfrastructure  develop  faster  than  the  eastern  coastal  region  because  of  massive \ninfrastructure construction. \nTake highways as an example. Table 4 indicates that in the second half of the 1990s, the \nspeed of growth in highways was almost the same in the eastern, central, and western \nregions.  The  only  exception  was  the  northeastern  region.  After  2000,  however,  while \n18 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \nhighway development in the eastern region remained fast (6.7 percentage points higher than \nin 1994\u20131995), it was faster in the central, western, and northeastern regions. In 2000\u20132004, \nthe highway development rates for these regions compared with that of the eastern region \nwere 26.4 percentage points, 18.8 percentage points, and 20.9 percentage points higher, \nrespectively. This is an indication that disparities in infrastructure between the different \nregions in the PRC have begun to narrow. This will have a long-term positive impact on \nimproving the investment conditions and increasing the potential for economic growth in the \nless developed regions and will inevitably help narrow regional disparities. \nTable 4.

The central government\u2019s attention to and policy measures on agriculture-related issues in \nrecent years also helped ease regional disparities. \nIn the PRC\u2019s less developed regions, a majority of the local population generally lives in rural \nareas. The 2000 census indicates that rural people accounted for more than 70 percent of \nthe total population in the central and western regions, a figure far higher than that in the \neastern region. For this reason, the support for peasants and agriculture was in fact more \nhelpful to the central and western regions and indirectly helped narrow regional disparities. \nIn recent years, the central government has introduced some policy measures to alleviate \nburdens on peasants. These measures include the experimental reform of rural taxes and \nfees that began in 2000. Ministry of Finance statistics indicate that the experimental reform \ncovered 620 million rural people or three-fourths of the PRC\u2019s total rural population. The \nlowering of the agricultural tax rate, the reduction of fees required of peasants, reform of the \ncollection and management of educational funds, and issuing of direct farming subsidies to \nthe peasants have gradually alleviated the burdens on the peasants. Agricultural taxes were \nwaived in more provinces and autonomous regions in 2004, and completely abolished \nthroughout  the  country  in  2005.  According  to  a  study  (Zhu  et  al.,  2003)  tracking  the \nexperimental  reform  of  rural  taxes  and  fees  and  the  reform  of  township  and  village \nmanagement issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, burdens on peasants were reduced by \nabout 45.8 percent in 2002 in the 20 provinces that carried out the experimental reform of \ntaxes and fees.  \nD.  An empirical analysis of determinants of provincial economic growth  \nIn order to further our understanding of changes in regional disparities, we will conduct a \nquantitative  analysis  of  determinants  of  regional  economic  growth.  Using  provincial \neconomic growth data, we will investigate the main factors that influence regional economic \ngrowth and regional disparities. \nThe basic estimation method of regional economic growth is regression analysis based on a \ngrowth equation derived from the new classical growth model (Barro and Sala-I-Martin, \n1995). The basic equation employed here is: \n1 y (1\u2212e\u2212\u03b21T)\n( )\u22c5ln( i,t\u22121+T)=\u03b1\u2212ln(y )\u22c5[ ]+\u03b2\u22c5X+u +\u03b5,                 (1) \nT y i,t\u22121 T i it\ni,t\u22121\n19 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \nwhere \nT stands for the length of time interval;6 \ny represents provincial per capita GDP in year t (calculated in terms of constant \ni,t\nprices in 1978); \nX stands for factors influencing regional economic growth; \n\u03b2 is coefficient; and \nuand\u03b5are residual errors. \nBased on results of similar studies, we choose to examine the effects of factors including \nfixed asset investment rate, average education level, development level of infrastructure, \nregional  marketization  degree,  urbanization  rate,  and  share  of  regional  government \nexpenditure in GDP on economic growth. The final regression equation is: \ng =a+\u03b2ln(y )+\u03b2Inv +\u03b2Edu +\u03b2Inf +\u03b2Soe +\u03b2Urb +\u03b2Gov +u +\u03b5, (2) \ni,t 1 i,t\u22121 2 i,t 3 i,t 4 i,t 5 i,t 5 i,t 6 i,t i it\nwhere \nt (= 1991, 1994, 1997, 2000, and 2003) is the beginning year of each time interval; \ng  represents average growth rate of per capita GDP of province i during the time \ni,t\ninterval beginning with year t; \nInv stands for fixed asset investment rate of province i in year t; \ni,t\nEdu stands for average education level of province i proxied by the share of population \ni,t\nwith education levels of junior high school or above to population aged six and over, which \nreflects the impact of human capital level on the economy; \nInf represents development level of infrastructure of province i proxied by railway \ni,t\ndensity in year t; \nSoe is the share of gross industrial output value of state-owned enterprises in total \ni,t\nindustrial  output  value  of  province  i  in  year  t,  which  represents  regional  marketization \ndegree,7  \nUrb is the urbanization rate; and \ni,t\nGov is the share of regional government expenditure in GDP. \ni,t\n                                                 \n6 We divide the sampling period into several time intervals after accounting for lagged effects of some institutional \nfactors and labor capital on regional economic growth and eliminating effects of business cycle fluctuations. \nHere T is 3 years. \n7 Since 1999, the gross industrial output value of state-owned and state-controlled enterprises have been \nincluded in provincial statistical yearbooks and are both regarded as gross industrial output value of state-\nowned enterprises, which leads to inconsistency with previous data. Therefore, here we only choose the index \nof gross industrial output value of state-owned enterprises.  \n20 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \nTaking into account the fact that the PRC\u2019s economic system has undergone significant \nchanges since its reform and opening up, especially the establishment of a market-oriented \neconomic system after the 1990s, we choose samples between 1991 and 2005, with the \ntime  interval  of  three  years,  i.e.,  1991\u20131993, 1994\u20131996,  1997\u20131999, 2000\u20132002,  and \n2003\u20132005. We choose the explanatory variable\u2019s value in the beginning year of the periods \nrather than average value in three years to overcome the problem of endogeneity. Due to \ndata deficiency of Chongqing, we merge the data of Chongqing and Sichuan and thus get \nthe panel data of 30 provinces.  \nNow we will conduct the regression analysis. First, we have to perform the Hausman test to \nchoose between a fixed effects model and a random effects model. Also, we have to deal \nwith autocorrelation in residual errors due to the fact that autocorrelation usually exists in \ntime series economic data. Table 5 reports the results assuming autocorrelation and no \nautocorrelation in residual errors. Based on the model results, we choose a fixed effects \nmodel with disturbance term AR(1) (i.e., assume\u03b5 in equation 2 satisfies\u03b5 =\u03c1\u03b5 +v , \nit it t\u22121 t\nwhere E(v )=0, E(v2)=\u03c32),8 that is Model I in Table 5. \nt t v\nTable 5.

Based  on  the  regression  results,  the  following  key  observations  should  be \nconsidered in efforts to form such policies. \n1. Fixed investment rate is an important factor driving regional economic growth in \nthe PRC. An increase of one percentage point of fixed investment rate in the beginning year \nof the time intervals will lead to a rise of 0.072 percentage points in average economic \ngrowth rate during the whole time interval. This figure is similar to the estimation of 0.073 \npercentage points by Cai et al. (2002) but lower than the estimation of 0.2\u20130.35 percentage \npoints by Demurger (2001). The PRC\u2019s relatively high fixed investment rate can exercise an \nimportant influence on regional economic growth. The regional fixed investment rate in the \nPRC  is  not  completely  endogenously  determined.  Local  governments  can  affect  the \ninvestment decisions of enterprises to some extent and national policies can influence \nregional distribution of investment (including FDI).  \n                                                 \n8 As for testing autocorrelation, Stata software provides two indexes: modified Bhargava et al. D-W and Baltagi-\nWu LBI (locally best invariant). \n21 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \n2. The improvement of education levels can significantly promote regional economic \ngrowth. According to results shown in Table 5, an increase of one percentage point of the \nshare of people above six years old with education levels of junior secondary school or \nabove in the beginning year of the time interval will raise the regional economic growth rate \nby 0.14 percentage points in each of the years that followed. In terms of absolute value of \nthe coefficient, the impact of education level on regional economic growth seems to be very \nlarge. \n3.  The  improvement  of  marketization  degree  can  significantly  boost  regional \neconomic  growth.  We  proxy  regional  marketization  degree  with  the  share  of  gross \nindustrial output value of state-owned enterprises in total industrial output value. Generally \nspeaking, the bigger the share of state-owned enterprises of one region, the higher local \ngovernment interference with the economy and the lower regional marketization degree. \nTherefore, the coefficient of marketization degree should be negative. According to our \nregression results, the coefficient of Soe is statistically significant and negative, indicating \nthat for those regions with big shares of state-owned enterprises in the beginning year, their \neconomic  growth  rate  will  be  slower  in  the  years  that  followed.  That  is,  high  regional \nmarketization degree can promote economic growth, which is consistent with results of \nCheng and Yi (2000) and Lin and Liu. (2003). \n4.  There  is  a  significantly  positive  correlation  between  the  development  level  of \ninfrastructure and regional economic growth. We use the index of railway density to \nmeasure the development level of infrastructure and find that the coefficient is positive, \nwhich is consistent with results of Demurger (2001). The impact of infrastructure level on \nregional economic growth is relatively large. In Shanxi province, for example, an increase of \n0.0046 km per km2 of railway density from 1990 to 2002 is accompanied by a rise of 1.38 \npercentage points of regional economic growth rate. \n5. The share of regional government expenditure in GDP (which reflects government \ninterference with the economy) has a positive impact on regional economic growth. \nAn increase of one percentage point in the share of regional government expenditure in \nGDP can increase the regional economic growth rate by about 0.12 percentage points. \n6.  Urbanization  level  exerts  a  significantly  positive  impact  on  regional  economic \ngrowth. An increase of one percentage point in the urbanization rate in the beginning year \ncan step up the regional economic growth rate by about 0.13 percentage points in the years \nthat followed. Other previous studies such as Lu and Chen (2004) also showcase similar \nresults. \n7.  Significant  conditional  convergence  existed  among  regions  in  the  PRC  in  the \nperiod 1991\u20132005. That is, after controlling other factors, the economic growth rate of more \ndeveloped regions was slower, which is confirmed by the negative coefficient of ln(y ). The \n0\nevidence of previous similar studies seems to be mixed. Some studies (Cai et al., 2002; Lin \net al., 2003) show that there exists conditional convergence among regions in the PRC while \nothers (Wang, 2004) find that such convergence does not exist. \nINCOME DISPARITIES WITHIN PROVINCES AND THEIR CHANGES \nDue to the large land and population size in the provinces, natural endowments, economic \nand social conditions, and the culture of various regions within a province also differ greatly. \nThe income disparity within provinces could be a serious problem. In this section we use the \ndata of prefectures and counties to analyze the income disparity within provinces. \n22 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \nE.  Degree of Income Disparities within Provinces \nIn order to analyze income disparities within provinces, we examine indicators of per capita \nGDP at the prefecture level. Based on the PRC\u2019s administration framework, a province is \ngenerally composed of around 12 regional districts. The data listed in Table 6 represent the \nratio of maximum to minimum per capita GDP at the prefecture level within each province \nduring the period 1997\u20132005.  \nThe ratio of maximum to minimum per capita GDP at prefecture level demonstrates obvious \ngaps within each province. In 2005, the ratios ranged from 2.6 to 10.4, and the average was \n5.6. Gansu province had the biggest gap. In 2005, per capita GDP of Jinchang prefecture \nwas 24,950 yuan, while that of Dingxi prefecture was 2,394 yuan (the lowest in the PRC), \nthe former being 10.4 times the latter. In Guangdong province, per capita GDP of Shenzhen \nprefecture was 60,801 yuan, which is 8.1 times of that of Heyuan prefecture.  \nFigure 18 illustrates the results of decomposition of income disparity among 28 provinces \n(excluding Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai) with that within the provinces. In terms of the \nspatial decomposition of the Theil index of regional disparity, the level of disparity within the \nprovinces is even higher than the level of disparity among the provinces. As Figure 18 \nshows,  compared  with  the  consideration  given  only  to  inter-province  disparity,  inter-\nprefecture disparity increased significantly. In 2005 for example, the value of the Theil index \namong the provinces is 0.098, but when the disparity between prefectures within provinces \nis taken into consideration, the overall value of the Theil index increased to 0.241. The latter \nvalue is 2.5 times the former. Looking at the share of disparity within and among the \nprovinces in overall disparity, the share of disparity within the provinces is higher than the \nshare among the provinces. From 1997 to 2005, disparity within the provinces had a share \naround 57.2% to 61.6% of the total value of disparity. It has surpassed the disparity among \nthe provinces. The decomposition of the Theil index shows that intra-province disparities are \neven more significant than inter-province disparities.  \nFigure 18.

Before \n2004, the figure for the urban population was based on registration system. Since 2004, inhabitant population has \nbeen used. For example, in Dongguang City, Guangdong in 2004 the figure for the urban population based on the \nregistration system was 1.62 million, while based on the inhabitant population it was 6.56 million. \nb/ That is, inter-provincial MMR exclusive of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. \nSources: Provincial Statistical Yearbooks from 1998 to 2006 (31 provinces). \nConsidering the changes of disparity within provinces over time, from 1997 to 2005, the \nregional disparities within most of the provinces widened. The MMR of 18 provinces (see last \ncolumn of Table 6) increased during that period; it remained stable in one province, and \ndeclined in 9 provinces.

Similarly to the MMR, the Theil indexes of 19 provinces increased in 2005 \ncompared with 1997, and decreased in 9 provinces. These facts demonstrate that intra-\nprovince disparity in income of most provinces has widened in recent years. Compared with \nthe inter-province Theil indexes, we could conclude that in most of the provinces, internal \ndisparities in income among prefectures within provinces are more significant than inter-\nprovince income disparities. \nIf we consider the indexes at the county level, intra-province disparities should become more \nobvious. Table 7 gives the ratio of maximum to minimum per capita GDP at the county level \ncross  all  the  provinces  (excluding  Beijing,  Tianjin,  and  Shanghai).  The  ratio  in  Hainan \nprovince was the lowest (2.2), and the ratio in Jiangsu province was the highest (25.8). In \n2005, per capita GDP in Kunshan county, Jiangsu province was 113,025 yuan, which is 25.8 \ntimes that in Guanyun county (4,379 yuan) in the same province. Further, if we consider the \ndata of urban areas in big cities, intra-province disparity could be larger. For example, the \nMMR of Guangdong province is 9.5, which will increase to 16.4 if we include the data of \nShenzhen.  \nTable 7.

Relationship between Intra-province Disparities in Income and Economic \nDevelopment Level \nThe relationship between intra-province gaps and economic development is an interesting \nand important issue. According to the inverted U-shaped hypothesis (Williamson, 1965), \nresidents of developed areas pay more attention to regional gaps than do residents of less \ndeveloped areas because the local governments in developed areas have more financing \npower to balance the development across areas. Therefore, developed areas are less likely \nto suffer from large regional disparities.  \nFigure 19 illustrates the relationship between economic development level (value of per \ncapita GDP) and intra-province disparities in 2005 (by Theil indexes at the prefecture level \nwithin provinces, excluding Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai). Overall, there is no significant \nrelationship between these two. In some less developed provinces, intra-province disparities \nare insignificant, like in Guangxi and Guizhou. In other less developed provinces, these \ndisparities  are  salient,  like  in  Gansu.  Similarly,  some  of  the  developed  provinces,  like \n25 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \nZhejiang, have smaller intra-province gaps, whereas in Guangdong and Jiangsu, these \ndisparities are much larger. \nFigure 19.

This  rural-urban  gap  has  widened  since  1994,  and  has  exerted  a  significant \ninfluence on national income inequity. Using a data set that includes data of household \nconsumption in 28 provinces of the PRC from 1983 to 1995. Kanbur and Zhang (1999) find \nthat rural-urban disparities account for 70 percent of total regional gaps. Further, since the \nlate  1990s,  the  PRC\u2019s  urbanization  rate  has  accelerated.  From  1978  to  1995,  the \nurbanization rate improved 0.65 percentage point annually on average; while during 1996 to \n2005, urbanization rate grew at 1.4 percentage points annually. Additionally, the PRC\u2019s \nregulations on population migration from rural to urban areas have significantly relaxed \nrecently, and this has resulted in a huge amount of rural labor moving to urban areas. All of \nthese trends influence rural-urban gaps significantly. \nG.  Inter-provincial Rural-urban Income Disparity based on MMR \nFigure 21 describes inter-provincial disparities in terms of MMR of urban and rural household \nincome. The MMR of inter-provincial urban household disposable income has been very \nstable, and has stayed around 2.2. The MMR of inter-provincial rural household net income \nhas not changed much, but its ratios were higher than urban ones. \nFigure 21.

Since then, the expansive trend of \nurban-rural income disparities has slowed somewhat, with the ratio of 9.9 in 2005. This high \nratio shows that the income gap between rural and urban areas is significant. \nH.  Decomposition of inter-provincial disparity into rural-urban income gap  \nFigures 22 and 23 illustrate how the Theil indexes of inter-provincial income disparities \ndecomposed into gaps between rural and urban areas, between urban areas, and between \nrural areas. We divide each province into urban and rural areas and get 62 regions within the \nnation,  with  half  of  the  areas  rural  and  the  other  half  urban.  The  Theil  indexes  are \ndecomposed based on this classification. Figures 22 and 23 demonstrate the results based \non per capita household consumption and household income, respectively.

In 1984, the Theil index of the level of household consumption \namong urban areas is only 0.002. This reflects that the disparity of consumption among \nurban was small by that time. This index grew to 0.017 in 2005, which is 7 times the value in \n1984, but the disparity of consumption level of urban areas accounts for only 7% of the total \nvalue of disparity. Similarly, the Theil index of household income among urban areas grew \nfrom 0.002 in 1984 to 0.014 in 2005; its share of total disparity increased from 4.5% to 6.3% \n(Figure 22). \nFigure 23 Decomposition of Inter-provincial Disparity into Urban and Rural Areas \nbased on Household Income \n0.25\nUrban-Urban\n0.20\nx\ne\nd\nn 0.15\ni\n \nL\n_ Rural-Rural\nl\ni 0.10\ne\nh\nT 80.4%\nRural-Urban\n0.05\n56.7%\n0.00\n1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004\n   \nSource: Provincial Statistical Yearbooks 2006 (31 provinces). \nThere was also an increase in regional disparity to some extent among the rural areas.

The disparity of \nthe level of consumption between the urban and rural areas has a share of total disparity \naround 75.6% to 81.9% from 1984 to 2005. The Theil index of household income disparity \nbetween the urban and rural areas increased from 0.025 to 0.173 in the same period, which \naccounts for 86.6% of the net amount of increase of total income disparity; the share in total \ndisparity also increased from 56.7% to 80.4%. \nCONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS \nRegional  income  disparities  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  have  caught \nwidespread  attention  recently.  Many  studies  have  examined  different  aspects  of  these \ndisparities. Using regional data after adjustment based on the PRC\u2019s first economic census \n(conducted in 2004), we have attempted to conduct a comprehensive analysis of regional \ndisparities in the PRC using various measurement indexes. Unlike many existing studies, \nour study includes in-depth research on regional disparities within provinces in addition to \ndisparities among them. The findings show that regional disparities in the PRC have the \nfollowing main features:  \n1. Disparities among the PRC\u2019s four regions, especially between the eastern region \nand the other regions, are mainly to blame for inter-provincial disparities.  \nSince the PRC began its reform and opening up of the economy, inter-provincial disparities \nhave experienced a process of first narrowing and then expanding. In the early period of the \nreform, there were large internal disparities within the eastern region. But after the PRC first \ncarried out the policy of opening up in the eastern region and attracted a great deal of \nforeign investment, the development of some less developed eastern provinces was greatly \npromoted. Thus, internal disparities within the eastern regions declined, which contributed \nmuch to the decline of overall regional disparities in the PRC. After the 1990s, the growth \nrate in the more developed eastern region was still faster than that of the national average \nlevel, resulting in further expansion of disparities between the eastern region and the other \nregions and aggravating the regional inequality of the whole country. In 2005, disparities \namong the four regions accounted for more than 70% of total disparity, dominating the trend \nof regional disparities. \n2. Regional disparities exist both among provinces and within provinces.  \nIn addition to the great differences among provinces in terms of area, population, and \neconomic development level, disparities within provinces are also very common in the PRC. \nWhether judged by absolute level or indirect measurement indexes, internal disparities within \nmany provinces have even exceeded inter-provincial disparities. Based on the analysis of \ncounty- and prefecture-level data, we discovered that internal disparities within provinces \nhave shown no significant correlation with the economic development level of provinces. \nLarge internal disparities exist not only within the low-income provinces but also within the \neastern coastal high-income provinces. Compared with the levels in 1997, internal disparities \nin many provinces had expanded somewhat by 2005.  \n3. Urban-rural disparities are the main source of regional disparities.  \nUrban-rural disparities have contributed over 70% of regional disparities since the mid-\n1980s. The increase in regional disparities has been due mainly to the rapid expansion of \nurban-rural  disparities.  Urban-urban  and  rural-rural  disparities  have  also  expanded \nsomewhat, but they only account for a small share of regional disparities. Since 2000, the \nurbanization process in the PRC has been accelerated and the scale of urban-rural labor \n29 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \nmigration is also very huge, but urban-rural disparities continue expanding due to the fact \nthat the economic growth rate in urban areas is much higher than in rural areas.   \n4. The expansive trend of inter-provincial disparities has slowed down and started to \ndecrease somewhat since 2000.  \nBy analyzing the data after adjustment based on the PRC\u2019s first economic census, we found \nthat compared with the 1990s, the widening of regional disparities in the PRC has gradually \nslowed down since 2000. In 2004 and 2005, some statistical indicators, such as per capita \nGDP and household consumption level at current prices, show that regional disparities have \ndeclined to a certain extent. \nThe analysis indicates that compared with the 1990s, the growth rate in the PRC\u2019s coastal \ndeveloped region has slowed down somewhat in recent years. Meanwhile, economic growth \nrates in low-income regions have become slightly higher. As a result, the widening of \nregional  disparities  has  slowed  down.  The  factors  that  led  to  the  changes  in  regional \ndisparities included both policies and the macroeconomic environment. As far as policies \nwere  concerned,  the  implementation  of  the  Western  Area  Development  Strategy,  the \nattention  to  agriculture-related  problems,  and  a  host  of  other  policy  measures  helped \nstimulate fast growth and increase personal income in the less developed regions. With \nregard to the macroeconomic environment, most of the provinces that have posted faster \neconomic growth in recent years were those enjoying a comparative advantage in resource \nindustries. This is because the new round of economic growth has produced a strong \ndemand for energy and resources and stimulated a rapid development of the energy and \nresource industries. In addition, the fact that infrastructure construction has accelerated in \nthe central and western regions and narrowed their disparities with the eastern region, as \nwell as the fact that some industries have begun to move from the eastern to the central and \nwestern  regions,  has  also  helped  promote  coordinated  development  between  various \nregions. \n5. Changes in regional disparities are caused by many factors.  \nChanges in regional disparities in recent years can also be attributed to some cyclical \nfactors, such as the fast development of resource industries. For this reason, we still cannot \nclaim that the PRC\u2019s regional disparities have started a decline that will continue. But \nexperience in the past few years indicates that if the government adopts appropriate policy \nmeasures, including improvement of the investment climate, investment in human capital, \nimprovement of infrastructure in the less developed regions, reducing farmers\u2019 burdens and \nincreasing their incomes, and strengthening of the transfer payment system, it can alleviate \nthe widening of regional disparities and help achieve coordinated development between the \nregions. \n \n30 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \nAPPENDIX A: PRC\u2019S ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISION SYSTEM AND REGIONAL DIVISION \nA. Administrative Division into Districts \nOver time, the PRC has developed an administrative system that recognizes four levels of \ndistricts: the province level (including provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities), \nthe prefecture level (including cities at prefecture level), the county level (including counties, \nautonomous counties, and cities at the county level, as well as districts under the jurisdiction \nof cities), and the township level. \nProvince-level  districts  are  commonly  used  as  geographical  units  in  regional  disparity \nanalysis. Researchers often choose this level for their analysis because the geographical \ncoverage  and  population  distribution  in  the  provinces  are  relatively  stable  and,  more \nimportantly, because each province has a Bureau of Statistics and datasets. After the \nfoundation of the PRC, 29 provincial districts were established by the end of 1957, including \nthe three municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. In 1988, Hainan district, which had \nbelonged to Guangdong province, was upgraded to be Hainan province. Chongqing, which \nhad belonged to Sichuan province, became a fourth municipality in 1997. At the end of 2005, \nthere were 31 provinces in the PRC. These provinces had an average population of 41.0 \nmillion and an average GDP of 590 billion yuan (about 72 billion dollars calculated by that \nyear\u2019s exchange rate). \nEach province-level district is composed of about 12 prefecture-level districts (in 2005, \nbesides municipalities, there were 333 prefecture-level districts in the country). The average \npopulation of each prefecture was about 3.2 million in 2005, and the average GDP was 46 \nbillion yuan, which equals 5.6 billion dollars calculated by that year\u2019s exchange rate. \nPrefecture-level districts include a number of county-level districts. There are 2,862 county-\nlevel districts, about 7 in each prefecture. In 2005, each county had about 450 thousand \npeople and a GDP of 6.4 billion yuan, which is equal to 0.78 billion dollars. \nB. Regional Division \nAmong the PRC\u2019s 31 provinces, there are significant differences in natural environment, \npopulation,  social  structure,  science  and  technology,  and  economic  development.  We \nusually assign the 31 provinces into several regions as the basic outline of policymaking and \nrelated analysis. \nHu  Hanyong  Line. In 1935, a Chinese geographer, Hu Huanyong (1935), identified a \nborderline to differentiate population density. This was illustrated in his book, Population \nDistribution in China. The line started from Heihe, Heilongjiang Province, extended to the \nsouthwest, and ended in Tengchong, Yunnan Province (Figure A-1). He stated that on the \nland southeast of this line, which accounted for a mere 36% of the total national land area, \n96% of the national population was living.

In the \n\u201cSeventh-Five Year Plan,\u201d the State Planning Committee divided as the PRC into three \nregions: eastern, central, and western (Figure A-3). The eastern area included 12 coastal \nprovinces  (Beijing,  Tianjin,  Shanghai,  Liaoning,  Hebei,  Shandong,  Jiangsu,  Zhejiang, \nGuangdong, Fujian, Guangxi, and Hainan); the central area was composed of 9 provinces \n(Heilongjiang, Jilin, Neimenggu, Shanxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi); the \nwestern  area  also  comprised  9  provinces  (Shanxi,  Gansu,  Ningxia,  Qinghai,  Xinjiang, \nSichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Tibet). After the launch of the Development of the Western \nRegion strategy in 1999, Guangxi and Nemenggu, which originally belonged to the eastern \nand central areas, respectively, were assigned to the western area.  \n32 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \nFigure A-3.

After 2005, the PRC\u2019s central government has divided the nation \ninto four regions in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan.

For \nexample, the Development of the Western Region strategy focuses on the western regions, \nwhile the strategy to revitalize the northeastern region and other old industrial bases aims to \npromote the development of the northeastern region. The four-region division is reasonable \ngiven the current environment, and the intra-regional disparities are much smaller than the \ninter-regional disparity (see Figure 11). Therefore, we have analyzed regional disparities \nbased on this four-region system.  \n \n33 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \nAPPENDIX B: MEASURES OF REGIONAL INEQUALITY \nThe measurement of regional disparities is an arduous task; no single statistical measure is \nable to capture its myriad dimensions. This paper has applied some widely used measures \nto highlight various dimensions of regional income inequality. The selected measures are \nbriefly described in the following paragraphs. \n1) Maximum to minimum ratio (MMR) \nA comparison of the per capita GRDP (gross regional domestic product, or other index such \nas per capita consumption or per capita income) of the region with the highest income to that \nof the region with the lowest income (minimum per capita GRDP) provides a measure of the \nrange of the disparity between them. Maximum to minimum ratio (MMR) provides a quick, \neasy to comprehend, and politically powerful measure of regional income inequality. \n2) The Gini index is widely used in the inequality literature. Following Shankar and Shah \n(2003), we compute the unweighted Gini index as follows: \n\uf8eb 1 \uf8f6 1 n n\nG =\uf8ec \uf8f7\u22c5 \u2211\u2211 y \u2212 y , \nu 2y n(n\u22121) i j\n\uf8ed u \uf8f8 i j\nwhere y  and y  are the GRDPs per capita of regions i and j, respectively. n is the number \ni j\nof regions, and y  is the unweighted mean of the per capita GRDPs. G  varies from 0 for \nu u\nperfect equality to 1 for perfect inequality. \nThe unweighted Gini index takes every region in the same magnitude, i.e., every region was \ntaken as one equal unit regardless of its population size. The weighted Gini index, which \nweights the regions\u2019 per capita GRDPs based on their respective population proportions, is \ncalculated as shown below: \n\uf8eb 1 \uf8f6 n n PP\nG =\uf8ec \uf8f7\u22c5\u2211\u2211 y \u2212 y i j , \nu \uf8ed2y \uf8f8 i j P2\ni j\nwhere y =GDP P is the national mean per capita GDP. P and P  are the populations of \ni j\nregions i and j, respectively. P is the national population, and n the number of regions. G  \nu\nvaries from 0 for perfect equality to 1 - (P P) for perfect inequality, where P represents the \n* *\npopulation of the region which produced the total GDP. If P is small compared to P, i.e., if \n*\nthe region with a small proportion of the population produced all the GDP, then the value for \nperfect inequality would approach 1. \n \n3) Another commonly used measure of inequality is the Theil index. Following Theil (1967), it \nis computed as follows:  \n\u03b3\nTheil_T =\u2211\u03b3log i , \ni p\ni i\nwhere \u03b3 is the GDP share of region i and  p  is the population share of region i. For equal \ni i\nper capita GRDPs, i.e., with GRDPs proportional to regional populations, this index takes a \nvalue of 0. For a case where region i produces the entire GDP, Theil becomes log(P P), \ni\n34 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \nwhere P is the total population of the country, and P is the population of region i. Note here \ni\nthat as the population share of region i decreases, Theil increases if region i produces the \nentire GDP. \nTheil_T Theil_L\nSimilar  to  the   index,  we  can  compute  the   index,  which  uses  the \np\npopulation share as a weight, i.e., Theil_L=\u2211p log i . \ni \u03b3\ni i\nCompared to other measures of inequality such as Gini, CV (coefficient of variation), and Rw \n(relative mean deviation), Theil indexes satisfy several desirable properties, i.e., they are \nadditively decomposable, and satisfy mean independence (or income-zero-homogeneity), \nthe principle of population replication (or population-size independence), and the Pigou-\nDalton principle of transfers (Bourguignon, 1979; Shorrocks, 1980, Akita et al., 1999). An \ninequality index is said to be additively decomposable if total inequality can be written as the \nsum of between-group and within-group inequality. Mean independence implies that the \nindex remains unchanged if everyone\u2019s expenditure is changed by the same proportion, \nwhile population-size independence means that the index remains unchanged if the number \nof households at each expenditure level is changed by the same proportion, i.e., the index \ndepends only on the relative population frequencies at each expenditure level, not the \nabsolute population frequencies. Finally, the Pigou-Dalton principle of transfers implies that \nany expenditure transfer from a richer to a poorer household that does not reverse their \nrelative ranks in expenditures reduces the value of the index. \nSuppose that the regions are grouped into mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive \ngroups and each group can be divided into several small sub-regions. The Theil index can \nbe decomposed into within-group and between-group components as follows: \nI p I ni p\nTheil_L=\u2211p log i +\u2211p \u2211p log ij = L +L , \ni \u03b3 i ij \u03b3 B W\ni=1 i i=1 j=1 ij\nwhere the meanings of p and \u03b3 are the same as above, I is the number of groups, p is \ni i ij\npopulation share of sub-region j in group i, \u03b3 is the GDP share of sub-region j in group i, L  is \ni B\nthe between-group component of the Theil index L and measures the extent of inequality \ndue  solely  to  differences  in  the  group  mean  per  capita  GDP.  L   is  the  within-group \nw\ncomponent of the Theil index L and is defined by a weighted average of within-group Theil \nindexes L =\u2211ni p log p \u03b3  with the weights being the population shares of the groups \ni j=1 ij ij ij\nP. \nij\n \n35 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \nAPPENDIX C: INTRA-PROVINCE DISPARITIES AT PREFECTURE LEVEL SHOWN WITH \nTHEIL INDEXES \n2005- \n1997  1998  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005 \n  1997 \n  Jilin  0.040  0.049  0.054  0.078  0.084  0.085  0.088  0.084  0.052  + \n  Hebei  0.043  0.044  0.047  0.050  0.051  0.052  0.053  0.051  0.057  + \n  Guangxi  0.073  0.084  0.090  0.096  0.097  0.091  0.067  0.063  0.059  - \n  Fujian  0.090  0.097  0.102  0.106  0.104  0.111  0.074  0.073  0.071  - \n  Zhejiang  0.063  0.065  0.066  0.069  0.068  0.067  0.068  0.070  0.072  + \n  Shanxi  0.089  0.089  0.098  0.097  0.099  0.090  0.077  0.077  0.073  - \n  Hainan  0.077  0.077  0.076  0.116  0.110  0.107  0.063  0.062  0.082  + \n  Chongqing  0.105  0.146  0.141  0.145  0.149  0.139  0.081  0.075  0.097  - \n  Shaanxi  0.112  0.110  0.128  0.122  0.119  0.116  0.120  0.117  0.100  - \n  Henan  0.068  0.068  0.062  0.066  0.072  0.072  0.095  0.093  0.102  + \n  Hunan  0.054  0.058  0.061  0.073  0.080  0.085  0.076  0.079  0.102  + \n  Jiangxi  0.080  0.079  0.080  0.080  0.085  0.090  0.096  0.101  0.105  + \n  Sichuan  0.128  0.131  0.151  0.155  0.163  0.166  0.162  0.117  0.114  - \n  Tibet  0.116  0.117  0.113  0.132  0.127  0.137  0.101  0.116  0.115  - \n  Guizhou  0.106  0.108  0.108  0.114  0.124  0.126  0.125  0.125  0.122  + \n  Yunnan  0.280  0.283  0.236  0.224  0.211  0.204  0.200  0.192  0.151  - \n  Anhui  0.045  0.068  0.073  0.096  0.105  0.114  0.125  0.129  0.152  + \n  Shandong  0.138  0.142  0.149  0.158  0.159  0.159  0.162  0.161  0.153  + \n  Liaoning  0.153  0.163  0.182  0.200  0.196  0.194  0.189  0.181  0.159  + \n  Hubei  0.092  0.095  0.108  0.115  0.118  0.122  0.126  0.133  0.161  + \n  Qinghai  0.161  0.167  0.157  0.128  0.126  0.127  0.130  0.132  0.171  + \n  Inner Mongolia  0.089  0.089  0.088  0.095  0.098  0.118  0.137  0.125  0.179  + \n  Heilongjiang  0.114  0.111  0.135  0.202  0.198  0.184  0.177  0.171  0.197  + \n  Ningxia  0.262  0.279  0.273  0.292  0.262  0.221  0.218  0.206  0.243  - \n  Jiangsu  0.169  0.170  0.169  0.173  0.180  0.190  0.225  0.232  0.244  + \n  Gansu  0.260  0.246  0.229  0.243  0.252  0.247  0.258  0.265  0.268  + \n  Guangdong  0.238  0.251  0.261  0.291  0.312  0.336  0.337  0.337  0.283  + \n  Xinjiang  0.266  0.224  0.304  0.282  0.291  0.296  0.302  0.325  0.353  + \nIntra-Province  0.073  0.078  0.084  0.089  0.092  0.100  0.108  0.105  0.098   \nNote: Ranking by the value of Theil index in 2005 \nSource: Provincial Statistical Yearbooks from 1998 to 2006 \n \n36 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 85    Shantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n \nREFERENCES \nAkita, T., R.
