We find that compared with the 1990s, the expansive trend of inter-provincial \ndisparities  has  slowed  down  and  started  to  decrease  somewhat  since  2000.  In  2004  and \n2005,  some  statistical  indicators,  such  as  per  capita  GDP  and  per  capita  household \nconsumption  at  current  prices,  show  that  regional  disparities  have  declined  to  a  certain \nextent.  In  addition  to  the  great  disparity  among  provinces,  disparities  within  provinces  are \nalso  very common  in  the  PRC.  Judged  by  some  measurement indexes,  income  disparities \nwithin many provinces have even exceeded inter-provincial disparities. \n\nThe  results  of  decomposing  the  regional  disparity  into  within-group  and  between-group \ncomponents  suggested  that  the  urban-rural  disparities  are  the  main  source  of  regional \ndisparities.  The  results  further  suggested  that  disparities  among  the  PRC\u2019s  four  regions, \nespecially between the eastern region and the other regions, are mainly to blame for inter-\nprovincial disparities.  \n\nFinally, this paper finds that changes in regional disparities in recent years can be attributed \nto  many  factors,  including  policies  and  regional  specific  factors  as  well  as  some  cyclical \nfactors. For this reason, we still cannot claim that the PRC\u2019s regional disparities have started \na decline that will continue.  \n\nJEL Classification: O18, R12, O47 \n\n \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\nContents \n \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nSurvey of Literature Related to Regional Disparity in the PRC \n\nIndexes Measuring Regional Income \n\nRegional Disparities among the Four Regions in the PRC \n\nInter-provincial Disparities in the PRC \n\nA.

Even Guizhou province, with the lowest GDP per capita, has experienced \nan  eleven-fold  increase  in  economic  output  from  1978  to  2005,  with  the  annual  economic \ngrowth rate averaging 9.5% at constant prices. GDP per capita increased from 175 yuan in \n1978 to 5,052 yuan in 2005; this is nearly eight-fold growth with an average annual growth \nrate of 8.6% at constant prices.  \n\nHowever, the PRC is a large developing country with a huge population and a tremendous \namount  of  territory.  Among  the  regions,  the  natural  endowments  as  well  as  economic  and \nsocial  conditions  differ  greatly.  These  differences  predispose  the  PRC  to  having  regional \nimbalances.  This  regional  disparity  is  one  of  the  crucial  issues  faced  by  the  PRC  in  its \nmedium- and long-term development. It is also a core problem that the PRC must solve to \nachieve coordinated regional development. In-depth study of the regional income disparity in \nthe PRC is necessary for this effort. \n\nIn the 1990s, continuously growing regional disparity raised concern among the government \nand  society.  Many  scholars  undertook  rigorous  study  of  various  aspects  of  the  regional \ndisparity.  Most  of  these  studies  focused  on  the  problems  of  disparity  among  provinces; \nrelatively little systematic study has investigated disparity within each province.  \n\nThe PRC\u2019s provinces are large and populous. Seven of its provinces or autonomous regions \nhave  land  areas  that  exceed  400  thousand  square  kilometers;  nine  of  its  provinces  have \npopulations  over  50  million,  and  three  of  those  provinces\u2019  populations  exceed  90  million. \nBecause  the  provinces  cover  such  expansive  areas  and  contain  such  large  populations,  a \nvariety of differing conditions exist within each province. Therefore, study that focuses only \non the issue of disparity among provinces cannot accurately reflect the situation of regional \ndisparity in the PRC.  \n\nThe  unique  feature  of  this  paper  is  that  it  includes  analysis  of  regional  disparity  not  only \namong  the  provinces  of  the  PRC,  but  also  within  them.  The  analysis  is  based  on  recent \nupdated  statistical  data  that  has  become  available  since  the  PRC  implemented  its  first \nnational  economic  census  in  2004.  The  regions  adjusted  their  historical  economic  data  in \naccordance with the result of this national economic census, these adjusted data reflect the \nregion\u2019s economic conditions more precisely.  \n\nSURVEY OF LITERATURE RELATED TO REGIONAL DISPARITY IN THE PRC \n\nMany studies have examined the trends of change in inequality among the PRC\u2019s regions. \nMost  of  these  studies  found  that  regional  disparity  measured  in  terms  of  GDP  per  capita \ndeclined  significantly  from  1978  to  1990,  the  first  stage  of  the  PRC\u2019s  reform  and  opening \n(Jian, Sachs, and Warner, 1996; Lin and Liu, 2003; Dayal-Gulati and Husain, 2000; Li, Feng, \nand Hou, 2004). Many of these studies recognized that the decline in regional disparity was \ndue mainly to the character of the rural reform in this stage. The reform heavily promoted the \ngrowth of agricultural production, so the underdeveloped rural areas\u2014which initially had per \ncapita outputs lower than the national average\u2014benefited highly from the reform.  \n\nHowever, a trend of continuous regional disparity has emerged since the 1990s (Wang and \nFan, 2004; Kanbur and Zhang, 2005). This is mainly due to the increase of disparity between \n\n \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\nthe  coastal  area  and  provinces  in  the  inland.  Wu  (2004)  studied  the  impact  on  regional \ndisparity  of  three  centrally  administered  municipalities:  Beijing,  Tianjin,  and  Shanghai.  He \ndiscovered  that  regional  disparity  in  the  PRC  is  reduced  greatly  if  the  data  of  these  three \ncentrally administered municipalities are excluded. Due to the unique features of these three \nmunicipalities, it is meaningless to compare the data of these three municipalities with that of \nother  provinces  in  the  PRC.  Therefore,  incorrect  results  will  be  obtained  if  these  three \nmunicipalities  are  studied  together  with  other  provinces.  More  recently,  Xu  and  Li  (2006) \ndiscovered that although the PRC\u2019s regional disparity has risen continuously since 1990, the \nrate of this increase has declined since the year 2000. \n\nSome  studies have found that the PRC\u2019s urban-rural disparities  constitute the main part of \nthe  overall  disparities.  Using  urban  and  rural  household  consumption  data  of  28  provinces \nexclusive  of  Beijing,  Tianjin,  and  Shanghai  between  1983  and  1995,  Kanbur  and  Zhang \n(1999)  found  that  urban-rural  disparities  accounted  for  70%  of  the  overall  regional \ndisparities.  Yang  and  Zhou  (1999)  also  provide  some  evidence  of  widening  urban-rural \nincome disparities. Some other studies have discovered that disparities between coastal and \ninland regions or among eastern, central, and western regions have been expanding rapidly \nsince  the  PRC\u2019s  reform  and  opening  up.  By  decomposing  the  Gini  coefficient,  Yao  and \nZhang  (2001)  showed  that  the  proportion  accounted  for  by  disparities  among  eastern, \ncentral, and western regions has risen to nearly 80% since 1990. Wang and Zhang (2006) \nadopted  the  Theil_L  index  decomposition  technique  and  also  discovered  that  disparities \namong  eastern,  central,  and  western  regions  have  grown  continuously  and  represented \nabout 77% of the overall disparities in the PRC in 2001. \n\nSince  its  reform  and  opening  up,  geographic,  institutional,  and  some  other  factors  have \nplayed important roles in changes of the PRC\u2019s regional disparities. Wang (2004) found that \ntownship  and  village  enterprises  (TVEs),  education,  and  capital  investment  were  among \nimportant  factors  determining  income  disparities  in  rural  areas.  Wang  and  Fan  (2004) \ndiscovered that FDI, governmental transfer payment, and labor migration have affected the \nchanging of the PRC\u2019s regional disparities. Peng (2005) examined the regional divergence of \ngrowth  in  the  PRC  from  the  perspective  of  sectors  (such  as  agriculture,  industry, \nconstruction, transport and post and other tertiary industries) from 1990 to 2002 and found \nlarge  heterogeneity  in  productivity  levels  and  movements  across  sectors  and  provinces. \nDecomposing  aggregate  divergence  into  within  and  between  sector  components  revealed \nthat the secondary and tertiary industrial sectors contributed to 87% of the total divergence. \nKanbur  and  Zhang  (2005)  showed  that  regional  disparities  can  be  explained  by  three  key \npolicy  variables:  the  ratio  of  heavy  industry  to  gross  output  value,  the  degree  of \ndecentralization, and the degree of openness. Some other studies (Litwack and Qian, 1998; \nYoung,  2000;  Demurger,  2001;  Demurger  et  al.,  2002;  Yang,  2002;  Renard,  2002)  have \nfound that factors including the PRC\u2019s regional development strategies, preferential policies \nin favor of cities, SOE reform, fiscal decentralization, and public infrastructure all contribute \nto  the  expansion  of  regional  disparities.  Li,  Feng,  and  Hou  (2004)  and  Poncet  (2005)  also \ninvestigated the PRC\u2019s regional protectionism and market integration. Young (2000) showed \nthat market segmentation has aggravated the growing trend of regional disparities because \nthe  lack  of  a  uniform  market  has  a  weaker  negative  impact  on  coastal  areas  than  on  their \ninland counterparts. \n\nINDEXES MEASURING REGIONAL INCOME  \n\nMany  indicators  can  reflect  regional  income.  The  following  three  are  usually  adopted  to \nmeasure the PRC\u2019s regional disparities. \n\n(1)  Per  capita  GDP.  Per  capita  GDP  is  the  most  frequently  used  index.  It  reflects  one \nregion\u2019s  production  capacity,  income,  and  economic  development  level.  Compared  with \n\n2 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\nother  indexes,  statistics  on  per  capita  GDP  are  relatively  complete  and  perfect.1 However, \nthis  index  alone  cannot  fully  capture  the  welfare enjoyed by  people  in one  region  because \nthis  welfare  is  directly  determined  by  a  combination  of  many  other  factors  including \nhousehold  incomes,  regional  prices,  and  public  services.  Although  household  incomes  are \nclosely related to per capita GDP, the two are not completely consistent due to transfers of \nfactor incomes and transfer payments among regions. \n\n(2)  Per  capita  consumption (household  consumption  level).  Compared  with  per  capita \nGDP,  per  capita  consumption  can  better  reflect  household  living  conditions.  GDP \nexpenditure  is  composed  of  capital  formation,  consumption,  and  net  export,  while \nconsumption  can  be  further  decomposed  into  governmental  and  household  consumption. \nThe  shares  of  capital  formation,  consumption,  and  net  export  may  be  different  in  different \nregions, and so are proportions of government and household consumption. For example, all \nprovinces in the western region have net inflows while most provinces in the eastern region \n(except Beijing) have net outflows because there are some transfer payments between the \ncentral  government  and  provincial  governments,  and  the  existence  of  large  transfer \npayments \nless  developed  regions.  Therefore,  household \nconsumption level is the most direct measurement of household living standards. \n\nfrom  more  developed \n\nto \n\n(3)  Household  income.  Household  income  is  the  main  determinant  of  household  living \nstandards  and  quality  of  life.  This  index  can  directly  reflect  the  welfare  enjoyed  by \nhouseholds.  In  the  PRC,  household  income  is  measured  by  urban  per  capita  disposable \nincome and rural per capita net income. The data of household income directly come from \nhousehold survey statistics produced by survey teams of the National Bureau of Statistics. \n\nPer  capita  GDP,  household  income,  and  per  capita  consumption  reflect  regional  income \nlevel  and  household  welfare  level  in  different  ways,  so  regional  disparities  based  on \ncalculations  of  these  three  indexes  are  somewhat  different.  There  are  great  differences  in \nconsumption  rates  among  different  regions.  For  example,  the  per  capita  GDP  of  Zhejiang \n(27,703  yuan)  was  5.48  times  that  of  Guizhou  (5,052  yuan)  in  2005,  while  the  share  of \nhousehold consumption in GDP was 35% for Zhejiang and 62.1% for Guizhou (see Figure \n1). The household consumption level of Zhejiang was 3.09 times that of Guizhou, indicating \nthat the regional disparity measured by consumption per capita is significantly less than that \nmeasured  by  per  capita  GDP.  On  the  whole,  the  household  consumption  rate  in  the  more \ndeveloped eastern regions (an average of 33.2% in 2005) is relatively low while the index is \nrelatively  high  in  other  regions  (an  average  of  40.4%  in  2005).  Therefore,  it  can  be  safely \nconcluded that regional disparity based on per capita consumption is less than that based on \nper capita GDP. \n\n                                                 \n1  For  example,  many  other  indexes  such  as  household  consumption  level  and  household  income  are  not \n\navailable at the prefecture or county level. \n\n3 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\nFigure 1.

Calculations using the latter can  produce \nlower  results  than  the  former  because  of  the  low  marginal  propensity  to  consume  for \nhouseholds with higher incomes. However, there is some variation between local household \nconsumption  level  and  actual  consumption  level  in  large  cities  like  Beijing  and  Shanghai \nbecause statistics on the PRC\u2019s household consumption per capita come from the national \nincome account, which reflects households\u2019 purchases of goods and services. In these large \ncities, purchases made by citizens from other regions account for a considerable proportion \nof total retail sales of consumer goods and services.  \n\nBecause  there  are  some  differences  among  results  calculated  using  the  three  indexes,  an \nintegrated  analysis  should  be  conducted  to  include  all  these  indexes  and  reflect  regional \ndisparities  in a  comprehensive  manner.  However,  due  to limitations  in the  data  availability, \nwe have chosen to use per capita GDP, household income, and household consumption per \ncapita for measuring regional disparities at the provincial level, and use only per capita GDP \nfor the prefecture and county levels. \n\nREGIONAL DISPARITIES AMONG THE FOUR REGIONS IN THE PRC \n\nGreat differences exist in terms of geography, resources, economic and social development, \nand culture between the PRC\u2019s coastal and inland regions. Since 1986 (the beginning of the \nSeventh Five-Year Plan) many studies have revealed obvious disparities among the eastern, \ncentral, and western regions in the PRC. In this paper we first analyze disparities among the \nfour  regions  differentiated  in  the  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan. 2 The  eastern  region  is  more \ndeveloped, with less than 9.6% of the nation\u2019s total area, more than 30% of the nation\u2019s total \npopulation,  and  over  40%  of  the  total  output.  Table  1  shows  the  shares  of  population  and \nGDP of the four regions. \n\nAs shown in Table 1, the share of output of the eastern region has risen from 43.8% in 1980 \nto 55.6% in 2005, with an increase of 11.8 percentage points over 25 years. Accordingly, the \nshares of output of other regions have declined somewhat since the PRC\u2019s reform and the \nopening  up  of  its  economy.  From  1978  to  2005,  the  share  of  GDP  of  the  central  region \n\n                                                 \n2 Appendix A presents the Chinese administrative system and illustrates the division of the PRC\u2019s regions. \n\n4 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\ndropped by 3.5 percentage points, while the shares of the western and northeastern regions \nshrank by 3.3 and 5 percentage points, respectively. \n\nTable 1.

The  population  growth  rate  of  the  eastern  region  is  higher  mainly  because  of \npopulation  migration  across  regions.  But  the  increase  in  the  share  of  population  of  the \neastern region has been much smaller than the increase in its share of GDP, indicating that \nlabor movement across regions is relatively slow. \n\nFigure 2 shows that per capita GDP in the northeastern region was higher than that of the \neastern region in the late 1970s. The ratio of per capita GDP in the northeastern region to \nthat in the eastern region declined from 1.2 in 1978 to 1 in 1990; and the ratios of per capita \nGDP in the central and western regions to the eastern region also declined, but on a smaller \nscale, from 0.627 and 0.563 in 1978 to 0.567 and 0.529 in 1990, respectively. In the 1990s \nthe gap between the eastern region and the other regions increased. The ratios of per capita \nGDP  of  the  northeastern,  central,  and  western  regions  to  the  eastern  region  in  1991  were \n0.97, 0.52, and 0.51, respectively, and they decreased to 0.76, 0.45, and 0.40, respectively, \nin 2000. After 2000, the changes in these ratios were smaller than they were in the 1990s. In \n2005  the  ratios  of  per  capita  GDP  of  the  northeastern,  central,  and  western  regions  to  the \neastern  region  were  0.66,  0.44,  and  0.39,  respectively.  Compared  with  2000,  the  ratios  of \nthe central and western regions have been stable in recent years.  \n\nFigure 2.

In  1978,  the  ratio  of  maximum  to  minimum  value  of  per  capita  GDP  was \n2.14. There were almost no changes in the ratio in the 1980s and it reached its lowest point \nof 1.91 in 1990. But the ratio has been on the rise since 1990 and reached 2.58 in 2005, with \nper  capita  GDP  of  24,024  yuan  for  the  eastern  region.  In  sum,  disparities  among  the  four \nregions  measured  in  terms  of  changes  in  the  ratio  of  maximum  to  minimum  value  of  per \ncapita GDP have been rising since the reform and opening up of the economy. However, the \nratios  of  maximum  to  minimum  value  of  per  capita  GDP  were  2.57  and  2.58  in  2004  and \n2005  respectively,  suggesting  that  that  the  income  disparity  among  the  four  regions  has \nstabilized. Results of the Theil index show similar trends (see Figure 3).  \n\nFigure 3.

Beginning  in  1990,  however,  the \nper capita GDP growth rate of the eastern region accelerated. Especially in the early part of \nthe  1990s  its  growth  rate  was  much  higher  than  those  of  the  central,  western,  and \nnortheastern  regions.  For  example,  the  growth  rates  of  per  capita  GDP  in  the  eastern, \ncentral,  western,  and  northeastern  regions  were  13.69%,  10.53%,  9.59%,  and  8.59% \nrespectively  from  1990  to  1997;  the  growth  rate  in  the  eastern  region  was  3.1\u20135.1 \npercentage  points  higher  than  those  in  the  other  regions.  After  2000,  the  eastern  region \nmaintained  a  higher  growth  rate,  but  the  difference  between  it  and  the  other  regions  has \nnarrowed.  The  growth  rates  of  per  capita  GDP  in  the  eastern,  central,  western,  and \nnortheastern regions were 11.48%, 10.86%, 10.89%, and 10.64% respectively from 2000 to \n2005;  the differences were  only  0.6\u20130.8 percentage  point.  As  a result  the income  disparity \namong the four regions remains stable. \n\nIn  short,  there  was  declining  regional  disparity  among  the  four  regions  of  the  PRC  in  the \n1980s,  which  was  mainly  due  to  the  continuous  decline  of  regional  disparity  between  the \nnortheastern and eastern regions. In the 1990s, especially in the first half of the 1990s, there \nwas  a  significant  widening  of  the  gap  among  the  four  regions.  This  was  mainly  due  to  the \nextraordinarily  high  economic  growth  rate  of  the  eastern  region  compared  to  the  other \nregions. Since 2000, although there is still growth of the disparities among the four regions, \nthe rate of increase has become relatively smooth. Disparities in per capita GDP among the \nfour regions were stable in 2003, 2004, and 2005. \n\n6 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\nFigure 4.

For example, in 2004 GDP was considered to be 1.369 \ntrillion yuan before the census, and was adjusted to 1.599 trillion based on the results of the \ncensus. The adjusted GDP was 17.8% higher than the non-adjusted figure. All regions made \nadjustments  to  their  historical  economic  data  in  accordance  with  the  result  of  this  national \neconomic  census.  For  example,  in  2004  GDP  in  Beijing,  Shanxi,  and  Guangdong  were \nadjusted upward by 41.5%, 17.4%, and 17.4%, respectively, and that in Heilongjiang, Hubei, \nand  Guangxi  were  adjusted  downward  by  10.4%,  4.8%,  and  10.7%,  respectively.  The \nadjusted data reflect the economic conditions of the regions more accurately. In this paper, \nour analysis is based upon the adjusted data, which is based on the results of this national \neconomic census.     \n\nA. \n\nTrend of Inter-provincial Income Disparity  \n\n1.  Changes in regional disparities measured by ratio of maximum to \n\nminimum values \n\nThe  ratio  of  maximum  to  minimum  values  of  income  (Max/Min,  or  MMR)  can  describe \nregional  disparities.  We  first  conduct  a  simple  analysis  of  regional  disparities  using  this \nmeasure.3 \n\nAt  the  beginning  of  the  reform  and  opening  up  of  the  economy,  regional  disparities  in  the \nPRC were relatively large. In 1978, the per capita GDP of Shanghai was 2,497 yuan, almost \n14.2 times that of Guizhou province, with the lowest per capita GDP. As indicated by Figure \n5, the ratio of maximum to minimum per capita GDP decreased from 14.2 in 1978 to 7.3 in \n1990, rose to 13.0 in 2000, and stayed relatively stable thereafter. But that has not been the \ncase  with  per  capita  consumption.  Inter-provincial  disparities  in  terms  of  per  capita \nconsumption  have  been  generally  on  the  rise  since  the  1980s,  but  after  1999,  the  level \nremained very stable. In 2005, both the ratio of maximum to minimum per capita GDP and \nper capita consumption declined compared with those of the previous year.  \n\n                                                 \n3 Appendix B presents the measures of regional disparities used in this paper. \n\n7 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\nFigure 5.

They are highly developed and have low \nproportions  of rural  population.4 Thus, the  three cities  are  not  easily  comparable  with  other \nprovinces  or  autonomous  regions.  Data  shown  in  Figure  6  do  not  include  these  three \nmunicipal  cities.  The  ratio  of  maximum  to  minimum  per  capita  GDP  among  the  provinces, \nexcluding the three municipalities mentioned, is smaller than that among all of the provinces. \nFor example, the ratio of maximum to minimum per capita GDP among all of the provinces in \n1978  was  14.3,  and  that  among  the  provinces  excluding  these  three  municipal  cities  was \n3.9, and in 2005 they were 13.4 and 5.5, respectively.  \n\nFigure 6 also depicts changes in the ratio of maximum to minimum values of per capita GDP \namong the provinces excluding the three municipalities. The data show that the trend of the \nchange in regional disparities among the  28 provinces and autonomous regions (excluding \nthe  three  centrally  administrated  municipalities)  is  similar  to  the  regional  disparities  among \nthe four regions. There has been a slight decline of regional disparity among the provinces \nand autonomous regions since the reform and opening up of the economy in the late 1970s \nup to 1990. The maximum to minimum ratio rose to 4.86 in 2000, reached the peak of 5.64 \nin  2004,  and  then  declined  in  2005.  A  similar  trend  is  shown  in  the  maximum  to  minimum \nratio of per capita household consumption. \n\n                                                 \n4 Urbanization rates of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai in 2005 were 82%, 73%, and 89%, respectively, while the \naverage urbanization rate of the whole nation was only 43%, and their per capita GDP (2006) ranked second, \nthird, and first in 31 provinces respectively. \n\n8 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\nFigure 6.

Changes in inter-provincial disparities measured by Gini \n\ncoefficient and Theil index \n\nAlthough  maximum  and  minimum  values  intuitively  reflect  changes  in  regional  disparities, \nthey  cannot  fully  show  inter-provincial  disparities  in  terms  of  development  level.  Therefore, \nwe  will  use  both  the  Gini  coefficient  and  the  Theil  index  to  supplement  our  analysis  in  this \nsection. \n\nFigures  7  and  8  show  inter-provincial  disparities  based  on  per  capita  GDP  at  current  and \nconstant prices (1978 = base year), respectively.  \n\nFigure 7.

As shown \nin  Figure  7,  the  unweighted  Gini  coefficients  based  on  per  capita  GDP  at  current  prices \ndeclined  from  0.357  in  1978  to  0.276  in  1990\u2014a  decrease  of  22.7%.  In  the  same  time \nperiod,  there  were  declines  of  12%  and  33.4%  for  the  weighted Gini  coefficients  and  Theil \nindex,  respectively,  based  on  per  capita  GDP.  The  results  based  on  1978  constant  prices \nare  quite  similar,  but  the  amount  of  decrease  is  smaller.  The  unweighted  Gini  coefficients \nand  Theil  index  decreased  by  6.1%  and  6.3%,  respectively,  and  the  weighted  Gini \ncoefficients increased by 0.9%.  \n\nIn the 1990s inter-provincial income disparity grew rapidly. The unweighted Gini coefficients \nbased on per capita GDP at current prices increased from 0.276 in 1990 to 0.347 in 2000\u2014\nan  increase  of  25.7%  with  an  average  annual  growth  rate  of  2.3%.  The  weighted  Gini \ncoefficients  and  Theil  index  based  on  per  capita  GDP  increased  by  25.8%  and  57.6%, \nrespectively. \n\nCompared  with  the  1990s,  the  widening  of  regional  disparities  in  the  PRC  has  gradually \nslowed  down  since  2000.  The  unweighted  Gini  coefficients  based  on  per  capita  GDP  at \ncurrent  prices  increased  from  0.347  in  2000  to  0.349  in  2005\u2014a  difference  of  only  0.5%. \nCompared  with  the  previous  year,  this  index  as  well  as  some  other  indexes  decreased  in \n2004 and 2005.   \n\nFigures  9  and  10  show  changes  in  inter-provincial  disparities  in  terms  of  per  capita  GDP, \nagain  exclusive  of  Beijing,  Tianjin,  and  Shanghai,  at  current  and  constant  prices  (1978  = \nbase year), respectively. The calculations excluding the three cities yield smaller disparities \nthan calculations  including all of the provinces.  For example, the range of unweighted Gini \ncoefficients based on per capita GDP at current prices among the 31 provinces is between \n0.276 and 0.356, but that among the provinces excluding these three cities is between 0.15 \nand 0.231. The weighted Gini coefficient has risen by almost one half from 0.159 in 1978 to \n0.238 in 2005. The unweighted Gini coefficient also shows a similar pattern. The Theil index \nhas climbed from 0.041 in 1978 to 0.101 in 2005. The figures also reveal that the rising trend \nof inter-provincial disparities has slowed down since 1994. \n\n10 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\nFigure 9.

The \nthe  28  provinces  and \nautonomous regions (excluding the three centrally administrated municipalities) is relatively \nsmall  and  the  change  is  relatively  stable.  The  Gini  coefficient  fluctuated  between  0.22  and \n0.23. \n\nincome  disparity  among \n\nB. \n\nSpatial Decomposition of Inter-provincial Disparities \n\nIn  order  to  explore  the  spatial  distribution  of  inter-provincial  disparities  in  the  PRC,  we  will \napply the group decomposition technique in the following analysis. \n\n11 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\nFigure 11.

The  disparity \namong the provinces and autonomous regions is mainly caused by the disparity among the \nfour  regions.  The  disparity  within  the  eastern  region  has  a  share  around  20%  of  overall \ndisparity,  while  in  the  rest  of  the  PRC,  the  disparity  within  the  western,  central,  and \nnortheastern  regions  all  together  have  only  a  share  of  10%  of  overall  disparity.  Also,  the \ndecline in regional disparity of the PRC during the period 1978\u20131990 was mainly due to the \nsignificant  decline  of  internal  disparity  within  the  eastern  region.  In  1978,  the  internal  Theil \nindex  of  the  eastern  region  was  0.055,  which  constitutes  a  share  of  49.8%  of  the  national \ntotal Theil index (0.110). In 1990, the internal Theil index of the eastern region constituted a \nshare of 26.6% of the national total\u2014a decline of 23.2 percentage points. The absolute value \nof  the  national  Theil  index  declined  by  0.037,  and  the  absolute  value  of  the  internal  Theil \nindex of the eastern region declined by 0.035, which makes for a share of 96% of the decline \nof  the  national  Theil  index.  Therefore,  it  can  be  said  that  the  change  in  eastern  internal \nregional disparity can explain in large part the change of the regional disparity of the whole \ncountry.  \n\nFigures  12,  13,  14,  and  15  show  the  distribution  of  the  PRC\u2019s  provinces  and  autonomous \nregions  according  to  their  level  of  development  in  terms  of  per  capita  GDP  in  1978,  1990, \n2000, and 2005, respectively. In 1978, there was large difference in the level of development \nin the eastern region. Among the ten provinces in this region, only Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai \nmunicipalities  and  Jiangsu  province  had  achieved  relatively  higher  per  capita  GDP,  while \nZhejiang,  Shandong,  Hainan,  and  Fujian  provinces  were  ranked  in  the  medium  and  lower \nlevels  of  per  capita  GDP  of  the  PRC.  Qinghai  province  ranked  seventh  in  the  PRC  at  that \ntime.   \n\n                                                 \n5  The decomposition method is described in part 3 of Appendix B \n\n12 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\nFigure 12.

Our subsequent analysis also uses this \napproach. \n\nSource: Data of Gross Domestic Product of China: 1952-2004 \n\nIn  1990,  there  were  significant  increases  in  the  ranks  of  Guangdong,  Zhejiang,  Shandong, \nHainan, and Fujian provinces. Nearly all provinces in the eastern region achieved relatively \nhigher  per  capita  GDP  except  Hubei,  Fujian,  and  Hainan.  Therefore,  internal  disparity  was \nreduced  significantly.  In  1990,  Xinjiang  province  in  the  western  region  was  ranked  among \nthe top ten in the PRC. Qinghai and Tibet were among the middle ten. In the year 2000, no \nprovince of the western region ranked in the top ten (see Figure 14), But Inner Mongolia, in \nthe western region, entered the top ten in 2005. \n\nFigure 13. Economic Development Level of All Provinces in PRC in 1990 \n\nLow per capita GDP Regions\n  (10)\nMedium per capita GDP Regions   (10)\n  (10)\nHigh per capita GDP Regions\n\nSource: Data of Gross Domestic Product of China:1952-2004 \n\nSince 1990, the continuous widening of disparities among the four regions is to blame for the \nexpansion  of  regional  disparities.  During  this  period,  the  process  of  the  PRC\u2019s  reform  and \nopening  up  of  its  economy  have  further  advanced,  the  economic  growth  rates  of  the  more \ndeveloped eastern provinces have been higher than the nation\u2019s average level, and all the \neastern provinces except Hebei and Hainan have become high per capita GDP regions (see \nFigure 14). Figure 14 also shows that not one province of the western region was in the top \nten in 2000. Therefore, disparities between the eastern region and other regions have grown \nfurther.  The  internal  disparities  of  the  four  regions  have  changed  modestly  from  1990  to \n2005, but the between-group Theil index, reflecting disparities among the four regions, has \nincreased  by  0.044  from  0.045  in  1990  to  0.089  in  2005,  which  accounts  for  86.3%  of  the \nchange of the nation\u2019s Theil index (this index increased from 0.081 to 0.124).  \n\n13 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\nFigure 14.

Disparities among the four regions accounted for 71.8% of the total disparities \nin  2005.  The  share  of  internal  disparities  of  the  eastern  region  was  17.1%,  and  the  share \nwas  8.7%  for  internal  disparities  of  the  western  region  and  2.3%  for  internal  disparities  of \nboth the central region and the northeastern region. \n\nC. \n\nFactor Analysis of Regional Income Disparity \n\nChanges  in  regional  income  disparity  can  be  caused  by  differences  in  regional  economic \ngrowth  rates.  If  high-income  provinces  grow  faster  than  the  national  average,  the  inter-\nregional income disparity can expand; if low-income provinces grow faster, the inter-regional \nincome disparity will narrow.  \n\n1. \n\nChanges in patterns of regional growth and regional disparities \n\nFigures  16  and  17  describe  the  regional  growth  patterns  in  1990\u20132000  and  2000\u20132005, \nrespectively.  After  the  PRC  began  its  reform  and  opening  up,  the  average  speed  of \ndevelopment in the eastern region was higher than in the other regions because the coastal \nregion  had  a  favorable  investment  environment,  an  abundant  supply  of  labor,  and  was \nopened  to  the  outside  world  earlier  than  the  rest  of  the  country.  This  trend  became  more \ntangible after the 1990s. In Figure 16, many provinces of the eastern region are located in \nthe upper-right part of the figure (with higher incomes and higher growth rates), while many \n\n14 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\nprovinces  of  the  western  and  central  regions  are  located  in  the  lower-left  part  (with  lower \nincomes and lower growth rates). This resulted directly in widening regional disparities in the \nPRC in the 1980s. \n\nFigure 16.

Not only did some low-income regions such as Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Qinghai, \nand  Shanxi  post  growth  rates  higher  than  the  national  average,  other  regions  whose  per \ncapita GDP was relatively low also saw a narrower gap between their growth rates and the \nnational average level than in the 1990s. Comparing Figures 16 and 17, we can find that the \nnumber of provinces located in the lower-left part of the figure (with lower incomes and lower \ngrowth  rates)  decreased,  and  number  of  provinces  located  in  upper-left  part  (with  lower \nincomes and higher growth rates) increased. As a result, the widening of regional disparities \nin the PRC has gradually slowed down since 2000. \n\nFigure 17.

As indicated in Table 2, five provinces saw lower growth rates \nin 2003\u20132005 when compared with the average growth rates in the 1990s. Except for Hubei, \nall of these provinces had per capita GDP levels higher than the national average. The other \n26 provinces and municipalities saw higher growth rates in 2003\u20132005 than in the 1990s. In \nparticular,  Tianjin,  Shanxi,  Jiangxi,  Liaoning,  Heilongjiang,  Inner  Mongolia,  Shaanxi,  and \nQinghai saw fairly quickly rising growth rates. Of these eight provinces and municipalities, six \n(except  Tianjin  and  Liaoning)  were  noted  for  relatively  low  per  capita  GDP.  Therefore,  the \ngrowth  rates  in  2003\u20132005  slowed  down  somewhat  in  the  developed  regions  and  gained \nmomentum  in  the  less  developed  regions.  This  resulted  directly  in  smaller  regional \ndisparities in the PRC in 2004 and 2005. \n\nTable 2.

As  a \nresult, the widening of regional disparities has slowed down.  \n\nThe  factors  that  led  to  the  changes  in  the  growth  pattern  and  regional  disparities  included \nboth  policies  and  the  macroeconomic  environment.  Among  these  the  following  five  factors \nare assumed to be the more important and effective. \n\n1.  The  implementation  of  the  Western  Area  Development  Strategy  and  revitalization  of  old \nindustrial bases in the northeast has effectively promoted economic growth in these regions \nand eased widening regional disparities. \n\nThe  central  government  decided  in  1999  to  implement  the  Western  Area  Development \nStrategy. As a result, the state dramatically increased funding for construction in the western \nregion. From 2000 to 2003, the central government spent more than 360 billion yuan in fiscal \nconstruction on  the  development  of  the western  region.  In  particular,  more  than  220  billion \nyuan in long-term government bonds were issued for this purpose. In addition, the financial \ninstitutions in the western region increased their loan balance by more than 950 billion yuan. \nThe state launched 50 new key projects in the western region, with a total investment of 730 \nbillion yuan. In 2004, the PRC launched another 10 key projects for the development of the \nwestern  region,  with  a  total  investment  of  80  billion  yuan.  During  2000\u20132004,  the  central \ngovernment  allocated  a  total  of  about  460  billion  yuan  in  fiscal  construction  funds  for  the \nwestern region, of which more than one-third was raised through government bonds issued \nfor  the  western  region.  The  central  government  also  earmarked  about  500  billion  yuan  in \n\n16 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\nterms  of  fiscal  transfer  payments  and  special  subsidies.  In  October  2003  the  central \ngovernment  began  to  implement  policies  to  revitalize  economic  and  social  development  in \nold northeastern industrial bases. Since then the economic growth of three provinces in the \nnortheastern region has accelerated. Table 3 indicates that from 2000 to 2005, the eastern \nregion\u2019s  share  of  nationwide  investment  dropped,  and  the  central  and  western  regions\u2019 \nshares increased. \n\nTable 3.

In  the  early  1980s,  the  investment  rates  were  largely \nidentical across the PRC\u2019s four regions. In the late 1980s, however, the state introduced an \nasymmetrical  development  strategy  to  allow  some  regions  to  get  rich  first  and  then  let  the \nricher  regions  help the  poorer  ones  get  rich.  As  a  result, the  coastal  region benefited  from \nsystem  innovation  and  liberalization.  While  domestic  investment  began  pouring  into  the \neastern  coastal  region,  foreign  investment  also  became  concentrated  in  this  region. \nAccordingly, the investment rate rose dramatically in the eastern region and remained low in \nother regions, with the eastern region\u2019s investment rate being 7\u20138 percentage points higher \nthan those of other regions. In the first half of the 1990s, the eastern region\u2019s investment rate \nwas  about  12  percentage  points  higher  than  that  of  the  central  region  and  about  10 \npercentage points higher than those of the western and northeastern regions. But after 2000, \nthe western region\u2019s rate of investment in fixed assets rose visibly and surpassed that of the \neastern  region.  In  2004,  the  western  region\u2019s  average  investment  rate  was  49.8  percent, \nwhich was higher than the eastern region\u2019s 42.1 percent, the central region\u2019s 39 percent, and \nthe  northeastern  region\u2019s  36.9.  Intensive  investment  spurred  rapid  economic  growth  in  the \nwestern region and a rise in the income level of the local people. Clearly, the implementation \nof  the  Western  Area  Development  Strategy  has  played  an  important  role  in  narrowing \nregional disparities. \n\n2. The regions with rich resources have seen their GDP growing faster with economic growth \nsince 2002. \n\nThe  PRC\u2019s  economy  entered  a  new  round  of  rapid  growth  in  2002.  Compared  with  the \npreceding years, nearly all regions saw their economies grow faster.  \n\nIn fact, nationwide shortages occurred in the coal, electricity, oil, and transport sectors from \n2002  to  2004,  with  price  levels  persistently  climbing.  The  price  levels of  coal  and  crude  oil \nrose particularly fast. In 2004, the ex-factory price index for the PRC\u2019s mining industry was \n\n17 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\n129.3,  far  higher  than  the  consumer  price  index  (102.4)  and  the  ex-factory  price  index  for \nindustrial  goods  (107.1).  Steep  hikes  in  energy  prices  boosted  the  outputs  of  various \nproducing regions and directly increased their total output values. They also attracted heavy \ninvestment in these sectors, thus pulling up economic growth in the regions where they were \nlocated.  Table  2  suggests  that  Tianjin,  Shanxi,  Jiangxi,  Liaoning,  Heilongjiang,  Inner \nMongolia, Shaanxi, Qinghai, and Shandong were the places where growth rates were fairly \nfast over the two years. Except for Tianjin, all these places have one thing in common: they \nall  enjoy  comparative  advantage  in  resource  industries  (mainly  coal,  oil,  and  natural  gas). \nTherefore, we can say that the narrowing of regional disparities in recent years was spurred \nby  the  rapid  growth  of  the  resource  (energy)  industries  in  this  new  round  of  economic \ngrowth. \n\n3.  The  pulling  effect  of  foreign  direct  investment  eased  somewhat  in  the  eastern  coastal \nregion. \n\n \n Compared  with  local  capital  investment,  investment  from  outside  a  region  has  a \nmore tangible pulling effect on that region\u2019s economic growth because it does not squeeze \nlocal  consumption.  In  particular,  foreign  direct  investment  not  only  provides  direct  funding \nsupport, but also brings to the local economy higher levels of technology and management \nexpertise. Therefore, such investment helps increase the competitiveness and growth rate of \nthe  regional  economy.  In  the  1990s,  foreign  direct  investment  on  average  accounted  for  a \nvisibly  higher  proportion  of  total  investment  in  the  eastern  region  than  in  the  central  and \nwestern  regions.  But  after  2000,  the  ratio  of  foreign  direct  investment  acquired  by  the \neastern region compared to local GDP declined slightly. The ratio was 8.6 percent in 1995, \nbut  dropped  to  5.3  percent  and  4.4  percent  respectively  in  2000  and  2004,  or  3.3  and  4.2 \npercentage  points  lower  than  in  1995.  Compared  with  1995,  the  ratios  for  the  central, \nwestern,  and  northeastern  regions  went  down  by  0.15,  1.0,  and  0.06  percentage  points \nrespectively  in  2004.  This  is  an  indication  that  the  contribution  of  foreign  direct  investment \ndeclined somewhat in  all regions after 2000. But the fall  was  more dramatic  in the eastern \nregion.  Experience  tells  us  that  foreign  direct  investment  can  better  promote  the  growth  of \nthe  regional  economy  than  domestic  investment  does.  That  is  why  the  decline  in  foreign \ndirect investment dampened the economic growth advantage of the eastern region over the \ncentral and western regions and hence eased the widening gap of regional disparities. \n\n4. Less developed regions saw infrastructure construction advance rapidly. \n\nInfrastructure  development  is  a  crucial  factor  for  the  speed  of  development  of  a  regional \neconomy.  The  development  of  infrastructure\u2014including  transport,  communications,  water \ncontrol,  and  power  infrastructure\u2014can  raise  productivity,  reduce  costs,  and  help  attract \nforeign  investment  and  accelerate  economic  development.  A  region\u2019s  geographic  location, \ntransport conditions, and telecom facilities strongly indicate disparities in regional economic \ndevelopment,  and  a  policy  in  favor  of  balanced  infrastructure  development  can  help \neconomic convergence among different regions. In the PRC, the infrastructure in the eastern \ncoastal  region  has  always  been  better  than  that  in  inland  regions  because  of  historical, \neconomic, and geographic disparities. Since the beginning of the reform and opening up of \nthe economy, the development of infrastructure in the eastern coastal region has also been \nfaster  than  in  the  rest  of  the  country.  In  recent  years,  however,  its  speed  of  growth  in  the \neastern  coastal  region  has  declined  somewhat  because  the  infrastructure  there  is  already \nrelatively  complete.  At  the  same  time,  the  central  and  western  regions  have  seen  their \ninfrastructure  develop  faster  than  the  eastern  coastal  region  because  of  massive \ninfrastructure construction. \n\nTake  highways as  an  example. Table  4  indicates  that  in  the  second  half  of  the  1990s,  the \nspeed  of  growth  in  highways  was  almost  the  same  in  the  eastern,  central,  and  western \nregions.  The  only  exception  was  the  northeastern  region.  After  2000,  however,  while \n\n18 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\nhighway development in the eastern region remained fast (6.7 percentage points higher than \nin 1994\u20131995), it was faster in the central, western, and northeastern regions. In 2000\u20132004, \nthe highway development rates for  these regions compared with that  of the eastern region \nwere  26.4  percentage  points,  18.8  percentage  points,  and  20.9  percentage  points  higher, \nrespectively.  This  is  an  indication  that  disparities  in  infrastructure  between  the  different \nregions  in  the  PRC  have  begun  to  narrow.  This  will  have  a  long-term  positive  impact  on \nimproving the investment conditions and increasing the potential for economic growth in the \nless developed regions and will inevitably help narrow regional disparities. \n\nTable 4.

The central government\u2019s attention to and policy measures on agriculture-related issues in \nrecent years also helped ease regional disparities. \n\nIn the PRC\u2019s less developed regions, a majority of the local population generally lives in rural \nareas. The 2000 census indicates that rural people accounted for more than 70 percent of \nthe  total  population  in  the  central  and  western  regions,  a  figure  far  higher  than  that  in  the \neastern  region.  For  this  reason,  the  support  for  peasants  and  agriculture  was  in  fact  more \nhelpful to the central and western regions and indirectly helped narrow regional disparities. \nIn  recent  years,  the  central  government  has  introduced  some  policy  measures  to  alleviate \nburdens  on  peasants.  These  measures  include  the  experimental  reform  of  rural  taxes  and \nfees that began in 2000. Ministry of Finance statistics indicate that the experimental reform \ncovered  620  million  rural  people  or  three-fourths  of  the  PRC\u2019s  total  rural  population.  The \nlowering of the agricultural tax rate, the reduction of fees required of peasants, reform of the \ncollection and management of educational funds, and issuing of direct farming subsidies to \nthe peasants have gradually alleviated the burdens on the peasants. Agricultural taxes were \nwaived  in  more  provinces  and  autonomous  regions  in  2004,  and  completely  abolished \nthroughout  the  country  in  2005.  According  to  a  study  (Zhu  et  al.,  2003)  tracking  the \nexperimental  reform  of  rural  taxes  and  fees  and  the  reform  of  township  and  village \nmanagement  issued  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  burdens  on  peasants  were  reduced  by \nabout  45.8 percent  in  2002  in  the  20  provinces  that carried  out  the  experimental reform  of \ntaxes and fees.  \n\nD. \n\nAn empirical analysis of determinants of provincial economic growth  \n\nIn  order  to  further  our  understanding  of  changes  in  regional  disparities,  we  will  conduct  a \nquantitative  analysis  of  determinants  of  regional  economic  growth.  Using  provincial \neconomic growth data, we will investigate the main factors that influence regional economic \ngrowth and regional disparities. \n\nThe basic estimation method of regional economic growth is regression analysis based on a \ngrowth  equation  derived  from  the  new  classical  growth  model  (Barro  and  Sala-I-Martin, \n1995).

Therefore, here we only choose the index \nof gross industrial output value of state-owned enterprises.  \n\n20 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\nTaking  into  account  the  fact  that  the  PRC\u2019s  economic  system  has  undergone  significant \nchanges since its reform and opening up, especially the establishment of a market-oriented \neconomic  system  after  the  1990s,  we  choose  samples  between  1991  and  2005,  with  the \ntime  interval  of  three  years,  i.e.,  1991\u20131993,  1994\u20131996,  1997\u20131999,  2000\u20132002,  and \n2003\u20132005. We choose the explanatory variable\u2019s value in the beginning year of the periods \nrather  than  average  value  in  three  years  to  overcome  the  problem  of  endogeneity.  Due  to \ndata  deficiency of  Chongqing,  we  merge  the data  of  Chongqing and  Sichuan  and  thus  get \nthe panel data of 30 provinces.  \n\nNow we will conduct the regression analysis. First, we have to perform the Hausman test to \nchoose  between  a  fixed effects  model  and a  random effects  model.

Based  on  the  regression  results,  the  following  key  observations  should  be \nconsidered in efforts to form such policies. \n\n1.  Fixed  investment  rate  is  an  important  factor  driving  regional  economic  growth  in \nthe PRC. An increase of one percentage point of fixed investment rate in the beginning year \nof  the  time  intervals  will  lead  to  a  rise  of  0.072  percentage  points  in  average  economic \ngrowth  rate  during  the  whole  time  interval.  This  figure  is  similar  to  the  estimation  of  0.073 \npercentage points by Cai et al. (2002) but lower than the estimation of 0.2\u20130.35 percentage \npoints by Demurger (2001). The PRC\u2019s relatively high fixed investment rate can exercise an \nimportant  influence on regional economic growth. The regional fixed  investment rate in the \nPRC  is  not  completely  endogenously  determined.  Local  governments  can  affect  the \ninvestment  decisions  of  enterprises  to  some  extent  and  national  policies  can  influence \nregional distribution of investment (including FDI).  \n\n                                                 \n8 As for testing autocorrelation, Stata software provides two indexes: modified Bhargava et al. D-W and Baltagi-\n\nWu LBI (locally best invariant). \n\n21 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\n2. The improvement of education levels can significantly promote regional economic \ngrowth. According to results shown in Table 5, an increase of one percentage point of the \nshare  of  people  above  six  years  old  with  education  levels  of  junior  secondary  school  or \nabove in the beginning year of the time interval will raise the regional economic growth rate \nby 0.14 percentage points in each of the years that followed. In terms of absolute value of \nthe coefficient, the impact of education level on regional economic growth seems to be very \nlarge. \n\n3.  The  improvement  of  marketization  degree  can  significantly  boost  regional \neconomic  growth.  We  proxy  regional  marketization  degree  with  the  share  of  gross \nindustrial  output  value  of  state-owned  enterprises  in  total  industrial  output  value.  Generally \nspeaking,  the  bigger  the  share  of  state-owned  enterprises  of  one  region,  the  higher  local \ngovernment  interference  with  the  economy  and  the  lower  regional  marketization  degree. \nTherefore,  the  coefficient  of  marketization  degree  should  be  negative.  According  to  our \nregression  results,  the  coefficient  of  Soe  is  statistically  significant  and  negative,  indicating \nthat for those regions with big shares of state-owned enterprises in the beginning year, their \neconomic  growth  rate  will  be  slower  in  the  years  that  followed.  That  is,  high  regional \nmarketization  degree  can  promote  economic  growth,  which  is  consistent  with  results  of \nCheng and Yi (2000) and Lin and Liu. (2003). \n\n4.  There  is  a  significantly  positive  correlation  between  the  development  level  of \ninfrastructure  and  regional  economic  growth.  We  use  the  index  of  railway  density  to \nmeasure  the  development  level  of  infrastructure  and  find  that  the  coefficient  is  positive, \nwhich  is  consistent  with  results  of  Demurger  (2001).  The  impact  of  infrastructure  level  on \nregional economic growth is relatively large. In Shanxi province, for example, an increase of \n0.0046  km  per km2  of  railway  density from  1990 to  2002  is  accompanied by  a  rise  of  1.38 \npercentage points of regional economic growth rate. \n\n5. The share of regional government expenditure in GDP (which reflects government \ninterference  with  the  economy)  has  a  positive  impact  on  regional  economic  growth. \nAn  increase  of  one  percentage  point  in  the  share  of  regional  government  expenditure  in \nGDP can increase the regional economic growth rate by about 0.12 percentage points. \n\n6.  Urbanization  level  exerts  a  significantly  positive  impact  on  regional  economic \ngrowth. An increase of one percentage point in the urbanization rate in the beginning year \ncan step up the regional economic growth rate by about 0.13 percentage points in the years \nthat  followed.  Other  previous  studies  such  as  Lu  and  Chen  (2004)  also  showcase  similar \nresults. \n\n7.  Significant  conditional  convergence  existed  among  regions  in  the  PRC  in  the \nperiod 1991\u20132005. That is, after controlling other factors, the economic growth rate of more \ndeveloped regions was slower, which is confirmed by the negative coefficient of \n)y . The \n0\nevidence of previous similar studies seems to be mixed. Some studies (Cai et al., 2002; Lin \net al., 2003) show that there exists conditional convergence among regions in the PRC while \nothers (Wang, 2004) find that such convergence does not exist. \n\nln(\n\nINCOME DISPARITIES WITHIN PROVINCES AND THEIR CHANGES \n\nDue to the large land and population size in the provinces, natural endowments, economic \nand social conditions, and the culture of various regions within a province also differ greatly. \nThe income disparity within provinces could be a serious problem. In this section we use the \ndata of prefectures and counties to analyze the income disparity within provinces. \n\n22 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\nE. \n\nDegree of Income Disparities within Provinces \n\nIn order to analyze income disparities within provinces, we examine indicators of per capita \nGDP  at  the  prefecture  level.  Based  on  the  PRC\u2019s  administration  framework,  a  province  is \ngenerally composed of around 12 regional districts. The data listed in Table 6 represent the \nratio  of  maximum  to  minimum  per  capita  GDP  at  the  prefecture  level  within  each  province \nduring the period 1997\u20132005.  \n\nThe ratio of maximum to minimum per capita GDP at prefecture level demonstrates obvious \ngaps within each province. In 2005, the ratios ranged from 2.6 to 10.4, and the average was \n5.6.  Gansu  province  had  the  biggest  gap.  In  2005,  per  capita  GDP  of  Jinchang  prefecture \nwas  24,950  yuan,  while  that  of  Dingxi  prefecture  was  2,394  yuan  (the  lowest  in  the  PRC), \nthe former being 10.4 times the latter. In Guangdong province, per capita GDP of Shenzhen \nprefecture was 60,801 yuan, which is 8.1 times of that of Heyuan prefecture.  \n\nFigure  18  illustrates  the  results  of  decomposition  of  income  disparity  among  28  provinces \n(excluding  Beijing,  Tianjin,  and  Shanghai)  with  that  within  the  provinces.  In  terms  of  the \nspatial decomposition of the Theil index of regional disparity, the level of disparity within the \nprovinces  is  even  higher  than  the  level  of  disparity  among  the  provinces.  As  Figure  18 \nshows,  compared  with  the  consideration  given  only  to  inter-province  disparity,  inter-\nprefecture disparity increased significantly. In 2005 for example, the value of the Theil index \namong the provinces is 0.098, but when the disparity between prefectures within provinces \nis taken into consideration, the overall value of the Theil index increased to 0.241. The latter \nvalue  is  2.5  times  the  former.  Looking  at  the  share  of  disparity  within  and  among  the \nprovinces  in  overall  disparity,  the  share  of  disparity  within  the  provinces  is  higher  than  the \nshare among the provinces. From 1997 to 2005, disparity within the provinces had a share \naround 57.2% to 61.6% of the total value of disparity. It has surpassed the disparity among \nthe provinces. The decomposition of the Theil index shows that intra-province disparities are \neven more significant than inter-province disparities.  \n\nFigure 18.

Before \n2004, the figure for the urban population was based on registration system. Since 2004, inhabitant population has \nbeen used. For example, in Dongguang City, Guangdong in 2004 the figure for the urban population based on the \nregistration system was 1.62 million, while based on the inhabitant population it was 6.56 million. \n\nb/ That is, inter-provincial MMR exclusive of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. \n\nSources: Provincial Statistical Yearbooks from 1998 to 2006 (31 provinces). \n\nConsidering  the  changes  of  disparity  within  provinces  over  time,  from  1997  to  2005,  the \nregional disparities within most of the provinces widened. The MMR of 18 provinces (see last \ncolumn  of  Table  6)  increased  during  that  period;  it  remained  stable  in  one  province,  and \ndeclined in 9 provinces. Appendix C provides Theil indexes based on prefecture-level data in \n\n24 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\neach  province.  Similarly  to  the  MMR,  the  Theil  indexes  of  19  provinces  increased  in  2005 \ncompared  with  1997,  and  decreased  in  9  provinces.  These  facts  demonstrate  that  intra-\nprovince disparity in income of most provinces has widened in recent years. Compared with \nthe  inter-province  Theil  indexes,  we  could  conclude  that  in  most  of  the  provinces,  internal \ndisparities  in  income  among  prefectures  within  provinces  are  more  significant  than  inter-\nprovince income disparities. \n\nIf we consider the indexes at the county level, intra-province disparities should become more \nobvious. Table 7 gives the ratio of maximum to minimum per capita GDP at the county level \ncross  all  the  provinces  (excluding  Beijing,  Tianjin,  and  Shanghai).  The  ratio  in  Hainan \nprovince  was  the  lowest  (2.2),  and  the  ratio  in  Jiangsu  province  was  the  highest  (25.8).  In \n2005, per capita GDP in Kunshan county, Jiangsu province was 113,025 yuan, which is 25.8 \ntimes that in Guanyun county (4,379 yuan) in the same province. Further, if we consider the \ndata  of  urban  areas  in  big  cities,  intra-province  disparity  could  be  larger.  For  example,  the \nMMR  of  Guangdong  province  is  9.5,  which  will  increase  to  16.4  if  we  include  the  data  of \nShenzhen.  \n\nTable 7.

According  to  the  inverted  U-shaped  hypothesis  (Williamson,  1965), \nresidents of developed areas pay more attention to regional gaps than do residents of less \ndeveloped  areas  because  the  local  governments  in  developed  areas  have  more  financing \npower to balance the development across areas. Therefore, developed areas are less likely \nto suffer from large regional disparities.  \n\nFigure  19  illustrates  the  relationship  between  economic  development  level  (value  of  per \ncapita GDP) and intra-province disparities in 2005 (by Theil indexes at the prefecture level \nwithin  provinces,  excluding  Beijing,  Tianjin,  and  Shanghai).  Overall,  there  is  no  significant \nrelationship between these two. In some less developed provinces, intra-province disparities \nare  insignificant,  like  in  Guangxi  and  Guizhou.  In  other  less  developed  provinces,  these \ndisparities  are  salient,  like  in  Gansu.  Similarly,  some  of  the  developed  provinces,  like \n\n25 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\nZhejiang,  have  smaller  intra-province  gaps,  whereas  in  Guangdong  and  Jiangsu,  these \ndisparities are much larger. \n\nFigure 19.

Similarly  to  the  results  of  the  prefecture \nlevel  data,  we  found  no  significant  relationship  between  regional  disparities  and  economic \ndevelopment level.  \n\nFigure 20.

This  rural-urban  gap  has  widened  since  1994,  and  has  exerted  a  significant \ninfluence  on  national  income  inequity.  Using  a  data  set  that  includes  data  of  household \nconsumption in 28 provinces of the PRC from 1983 to 1995. Kanbur and Zhang (1999) find \nthat rural-urban disparities account  for 70 percent of total regional gaps. Further, since the \nlate  1990s,  the  PRC\u2019s  urbanization  rate  has  accelerated.  From  1978  to  1995,  the \nurbanization rate improved 0.65 percentage point annually on average; while during 1996 to \n2005,  urbanization  rate  grew  at  1.4  percentage  points  annually.  Additionally,  the  PRC\u2019s \nregulations  on  population  migration  from  rural  to  urban  areas  have  significantly  relaxed \nrecently, and this has resulted in a huge amount of rural labor moving to urban areas. All of \nthese trends influence rural-urban gaps significantly. \n\nG. \n\nInter-provincial Rural-urban Income Disparity based on MMR \n\nFigure 21 describes inter-provincial disparities in terms of MMR of urban and rural household \nincome.  The  MMR  of  inter-provincial  urban  household  disposable  income  has  been  very \nstable, and has stayed around 2.2. The MMR of inter-provincial rural household net income \nhas not changed much, but its ratios were higher than urban ones. \n\nFigure 21. Inter-provincial disparities of rural and urban measured by MMR of \nhousehold income (at current prices) \n\nMax/Min\n\nUrban per capita disposable income (current price)\n\nrural per capita net income (current price)\n\nMax Urban disposable income/Min Rural net income \n\nUrban disposable income/Rural net income (National average)\n\n12.0\n\n10.0\n\n8.0\n\n6.0\n\n4.0\n\n2.0\n\n0.0\n\n1980\n\n1983\n\n1986\n\n1989\n\n1992\n\n1995\n\n1998\n\n2001\n\n2004\n\n \n\nSource: Provincial Statistical Yearbooks 2006 (31 provinces). \n\nThe ratio of the highest urban disposable income to the lowest rural net income among the \nprovinces  was  4.5  in  1980  and  reached  8.8  in  1994.  Since  then,  the  expansive  trend  of \nurban-rural income disparities has slowed somewhat, with the ratio of 9.9 in 2005. This high \nratio shows that the income gap between rural and urban areas is significant. \n\nH. \n\nDecomposition of inter-provincial disparity into rural-urban income gap  \n\nFigures  22  and  23  illustrate  how  the  Theil  indexes  of  inter-provincial  income  disparities \ndecomposed into gaps between rural and urban areas, between urban areas, and between \nrural areas. We divide each province into urban and rural areas and get 62 regions within the \nnation,  with  half  of  the  areas  rural  and  the  other  half  urban.  The  Theil  indexes  are \ndecomposed based on this classification. Figures 22 and 23 demonstrate the results based \non  per  capita  household  consumption  and  household  income,  respectively.  Both  sets  of \nresults indicate the following characteristics of rural-urban disparity:    \n\n27 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\nFigure 22. Decomposition of Inter-provincial Income Disparity into Urban and Rural \nAreas based on Per Capita Household Consumption \n\nSource: Provincial Statistical Yearbooks 2006 (31 provinces). \n\n1984 1986\n\n1988 1990\n\n1992 1994\n\n1996 1998\n\n2000 2002\n\n2004\n\n \n\nThe results of the decomposition indicate that the inter-urban areas income disparity based \non  the  level  of  household  consumption  increased  relatively  faster,  but  its  share  in  total \ndisparity  is  still  very  small.  In  1984,  the  Theil  index  of  the  level  of  household  consumption \namong  urban  areas  is  only  0.002.  This  reflects  that  the  disparity  of  consumption  among \nurban was small by that time. This index grew to 0.017 in 2005, which is 7 times the value in \n1984, but the disparity of consumption level of urban areas accounts for only 7% of the total \nvalue of disparity. Similarly, the Theil  index of household income among urban areas grew \nfrom 0.002 in 1984 to 0.014 in 2005; its share of total disparity increased from 4.5% to 6.3% \n(Figure 22). \n\nFigure 23 Decomposition of Inter-provincial Disparity into Urban and Rural Areas \nbased on Household Income \n\nx\ne\nd\nn\nI\nL\n_\nl\ni\ne\nh\nT\n\n0.25\n\n0.20\n\n0.15\n\n0.10\n\n0.05\n\n0.00\n\n75.7%\n\nx\ne\nd\nn\ni\n \nL\n_\nl\ni\ne\nh\nT\n\n0.25\n\n0.20\n\n0.15\n\n0.10\n\n0.05\n\n0.00\n\n56.7%\n\nUrban-Urban\n\nRural-Rural\n\nRural-Urban\n\n81.9%\n\nUrban-Urban\n\nRural-Rural\n\nRural-Urban\n\n80.4%\n\n1984\n\n1986 1988\n\n1990 1992\n\n1994 1996\n\n1998\n\n2000 2002\n\n2004\n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Provincial Statistical Yearbooks 2006 (31 provinces). \n\nThere was also an increase in regional disparity to some extent among the rural areas. Like \nthe disparity among urban areas, this inter-rural disparity also has a relatively small share of \ntotal disparity. The Theil index of the level of consumption among rural areas increased from \n0.017  in  1984  to  0.026  in  2005,  but  its  share  in  total  disparity  decreased  from  21.4%  to \n11.1% in the same period. The Theil index of household income disparity among rural areas \nincreased from 0.017 to 0.029 in the same period, and its share of total disparity decreased \ngreatly from 38.8% to 13.3%. \n\n28 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\nBoth  the  absolute  values  and  the  share  to  total  disparity  indicate  that  the  increase  of \ndisparity between the urban and rural areas is very significant. The increase of total disparity \nis mainly due to the increase of disparity between the urban and rural areas. The disparity of \nthe  level  of  consumption  between  the  urban  and  rural  areas  has  a  share  of  total  disparity \naround 75.6% to 81.9% from 1984 to 2005. The Theil index of household income disparity \nbetween the urban and rural areas increased from 0.025 to 0.173 in the same period, which \naccounts for 86.6% of the net amount of increase of total income disparity; the share in total \ndisparity also increased from 56.7% to 80.4%. \n\nCONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS \n\nRegional  income  disparities  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  have  caught \nwidespread  attention  recently.  Many  studies  have  examined  different  aspects  of  these \ndisparities. Using regional data after adjustment based on the PRC\u2019s first economic census \n(conducted  in  2004),  we  have  attempted  to  conduct  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  regional \ndisparities  in  the  PRC  using  various  measurement  indexes.  Unlike  many  existing  studies, \nour  study  includes  in-depth  research  on  regional  disparities  within  provinces  in  addition  to \ndisparities  among  them.  The  findings  show  that  regional  disparities  in  the  PRC  have  the \nfollowing main features:  \n\n1.  Disparities  among  the  PRC\u2019s  four  regions,  especially  between  the  eastern  region \nand the other regions, are mainly to blame for inter-provincial disparities.  \n\nSince the PRC began its reform and opening up of the economy, inter-provincial disparities \nhave experienced a process of first narrowing and then expanding. In the early period of the \nreform, there were large internal disparities within the eastern region. But after the PRC first \ncarried  out  the  policy  of  opening  up  in  the  eastern  region  and  attracted  a  great  deal  of \nforeign investment, the development of some less developed eastern provinces was greatly \npromoted.  Thus,  internal  disparities  within  the  eastern  regions  declined,  which  contributed \nmuch  to  the  decline  of  overall  regional  disparities  in  the  PRC.  After  the  1990s,  the  growth \nrate in the more developed eastern region was still faster than that of the national average \nlevel, resulting in further expansion of disparities between the eastern region and the other \nregions  and  aggravating  the  regional  inequality  of  the  whole  country.  In  2005,  disparities \namong the four regions accounted for more than 70% of total disparity, dominating the trend \nof regional disparities. \n\n2. Regional disparities exist both among provinces and within provinces.  \n\nIn  addition  to  the  great  differences  among  provinces  in  terms  of  area,  population,  and \neconomic development level, disparities within provinces are also very common in the PRC. \nWhether judged by absolute level or indirect measurement indexes, internal disparities within \nmany  provinces  have  even  exceeded  inter-provincial  disparities.  Based  on  the  analysis  of \ncounty-  and  prefecture-level  data,  we  discovered  that  internal  disparities  within  provinces \nhave  shown  no  significant  correlation  with  the  economic  development  level  of  provinces. \nLarge  internal disparities  exist  not  only  within  the  low-income  provinces  but  also  within  the \neastern coastal high-income provinces. Compared with the levels in 1997, internal disparities \nin many provinces had expanded somewhat by 2005.  \n\n3. Urban-rural disparities are the main source of regional disparities.  \n\nUrban-rural  disparities  have  contributed  over  70%  of  regional  disparities  since  the  mid-\n1980s.  The  increase  in  regional  disparities  has  been  due  mainly  to  the  rapid  expansion  of \nurban-rural  disparities.  Urban-urban  and  rural-rural  disparities  have  also  expanded \nsomewhat,  but  they  only  account  for  a  small  share  of  regional  disparities.  Since  2000,  the \nurbanization  process  in  the  PRC  has  been  accelerated  and  the  scale  of  urban-rural  labor \n\n29 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\nmigration  is  also  very  huge,  but  urban-rural  disparities  continue  expanding  due  to  the  fact \nthat the economic growth rate in urban areas is much higher than in rural areas.   \n\n4. The expansive trend of inter-provincial disparities has slowed down and started to \ndecrease somewhat since 2000.  \n\nBy analyzing the data after adjustment based on the PRC\u2019s first economic census, we found \nthat compared with the 1990s, the widening of regional disparities in the PRC has gradually \nslowed down since 2000. In 2004 and 2005, some statistical indicators, such as per capita \nGDP and household consumption level at current prices, show that regional disparities have \ndeclined to a certain extent. \n\nThe analysis indicates that compared with the 1990s, the growth rate in the PRC\u2019s coastal \ndeveloped region has slowed down somewhat in recent years. Meanwhile, economic growth \nrates  in  low-income  regions  have  become  slightly  higher.  As  a  result,  the  widening  of \nregional  disparities  has  slowed  down.  The  factors  that  led  to  the  changes  in  regional \ndisparities  included  both  policies  and  the  macroeconomic  environment.  As  far  as  policies \nwere  concerned,  the  implementation  of  the  Western  Area  Development  Strategy,  the \nattention  to  agriculture-related  problems,  and  a  host  of  other  policy  measures  helped \nstimulate  fast  growth  and  increase  personal  income  in  the  less  developed  regions.  With \nregard  to  the  macroeconomic  environment,  most  of  the  provinces  that  have  posted  faster \neconomic growth in recent years were those enjoying a comparative advantage in resource \nindustries.  This  is  because  the  new  round  of  economic  growth  has  produced  a  strong \ndemand  for  energy  and  resources  and  stimulated  a  rapid  development  of  the  energy  and \nresource  industries.  In  addition,  the  fact  that  infrastructure  construction  has  accelerated  in \nthe  central  and  western  regions  and  narrowed  their  disparities  with  the  eastern  region,  as \nwell as the fact that some industries have begun to move from the eastern to the central and \nwestern  regions,  has  also  helped  promote  coordinated  development  between  various \nregions. \n\n5. Changes in regional disparities are caused by many factors.  \n\nChanges  in  regional  disparities  in  recent  years  can  also  be  attributed  to  some  cyclical \nfactors, such as the fast development of resource industries. For this reason, we still cannot \nclaim  that  the  PRC\u2019s  regional  disparities  have  started  a  decline  that  will  continue.  But \nexperience in the past few years indicates that if the government adopts appropriate policy \nmeasures,  including  improvement  of  the  investment  climate,  investment  in  human  capital, \nimprovement of infrastructure in the less developed regions, reducing farmers\u2019 burdens and \nincreasing their incomes, and strengthening of the transfer payment system, it can alleviate \nthe widening of regional disparities and help achieve coordinated development between the \nregions. \n\n \n\n30 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\nAPPENDIX A: PRC\u2019S ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISION SYSTEM AND REGIONAL DIVISION \n\nA. Administrative Division into Districts \n\nOver time, the PRC has developed an administrative  system that recognizes four  levels of \ndistricts:  the  province  level  (including  provinces,  autonomous  regions,  and  municipalities), \nthe prefecture level (including cities at prefecture level), the county level (including counties, \nautonomous counties, and cities at the county level, as well as districts under the jurisdiction \nof cities), and the township level. \n\nProvince-level  districts  are  commonly  used  as  geographical  units  in  regional  disparity \nanalysis.  Researchers  often  choose  this  level  for  their  analysis  because  the  geographical \ncoverage  and  population  distribution  in  the  provinces  are  relatively  stable  and,  more \nimportantly,  because  each  province  has  a  Bureau  of  Statistics  and  datasets.  After  the \nfoundation of the PRC, 29 provincial districts were established by the end of 1957, including \nthe three municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. In 1988, Hainan district, which had \nbelonged to Guangdong province, was upgraded to be Hainan province. Chongqing, which \nhad belonged to Sichuan province, became a fourth municipality in 1997. At the end of 2005, \nthere  were  31  provinces  in  the  PRC.  These  provinces  had  an  average  population  of  41.0 \nmillion  and  an  average  GDP  of  590  billion  yuan  (about  72  billion  dollars  calculated  by  that \nyear\u2019s exchange rate). \n\nEach  province-level  district  is  composed  of  about  12  prefecture-level  districts  (in  2005, \nbesides municipalities, there were 333 prefecture-level districts in the country). The average \npopulation of each prefecture was about 3.2 million in 2005, and the average GDP was 46 \nbillion yuan, which equals 5.6 billion dollars calculated by that year\u2019s exchange rate. \n\nPrefecture-level districts include a number of county-level districts. There are 2,862 county-\nlevel  districts,  about  7  in  each  prefecture.  In  2005,  each  county  had  about  450  thousand \npeople and a GDP of 6.4 billion yuan, which is equal to 0.78 billion dollars. \n\nB. Regional Division \n\nAmong  the  PRC\u2019s  31  provinces,  there  are  significant  differences  in  natural  environment, \npopulation,  social  structure,  science  and  technology,  and  economic  development.  We \nusually assign the 31 provinces into several regions as the basic outline of policymaking and \nrelated analysis. \n\nHu  Hanyong  Line.  In  1935,  a  Chinese  geographer,  Hu  Huanyong  (1935),  identified  a \nborderline  to  differentiate  population  density.  This  was  illustrated  in  his  book,  Population \nDistribution  in  China.  The  line  started  from  Heihe,  Heilongjiang  Province,  extended  to  the \nsouthwest,  and ended in Tengchong, Yunnan Province (Figure A-1).  He stated that on the \nland southeast of this line, which accounted for a mere 36% of the total national land area, \n96% of the national population was living. Meanwhile, northwest of the line, the other 64% of \nthe total land was occupied by only 4% of the national population. This borderline is referred \nto as the \u201cHu Hanyong Line;\u201d it has been applied broadly as a regional division method in the \nanalysis of population, geography, and ecology. \n\n31 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\nFigure A-1. The Hu Huanyong Line to Divide Chinese Regions \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Population Distribution in China  (1935). \n\nCoastal  vs.  Inland  Regions.  From  1949  to  1986,  coastal  and  inland  regions  were \ncommonly  differentiated  in  economy  planning  and  statistical  analysis  (Figure  A-2).  This \ndivision  is  similar  to  the  Hu  Huanyong  Line.  It  divides  the  PRC\u2019s  31  provinces  into  two \nregions:  coastal  and  inland.  The  coastal  region  includes  11  provinces:  Beijing,  Tianjin, \nShanghai,  Hebei,  Liaoning,  Shandong,  Jiangsu,  Zhejiang,  Fujian,  Guangdong  (including \nHainan), Guangxi.  \n\nFigure A-2.

From 1986 to 2005, the division of eastern, central, \nand  western  areas  was  dominant  in  research  on  regional  disparities  in  the  PRC.  In  the \n\u201cSeventh-Five  Year  Plan,\u201d  the  State  Planning  Committee  divided  as  the  PRC  into  three \nregions:  eastern,  central,  and  western  (Figure  A-3).  The  eastern  area  included  12  coastal \nprovinces  (Beijing,  Tianjin,  Shanghai,  Liaoning,  Hebei,  Shandong,  Jiangsu,  Zhejiang, \nGuangdong,  Fujian,  Guangxi,  and  Hainan);  the  central  area  was  composed  of  9  provinces \n(Heilongjiang,  Jilin,  Neimenggu,  Shanxi,  Henan,  Hubei,  Hunan,  Anhui,  and  Jiangxi);  the \nwestern  area  also  comprised  9  provinces  (Shanxi,  Gansu,  Ningxia,  Qinghai,  Xinjiang, \nSichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Tibet). After the launch of the Development of the Western \nRegion strategy in 1999, Guangxi and Nemenggu, which originally belonged to the eastern \nand central areas, respectively, were assigned to the western area.  \n\n32 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\nFigure A-3.

After  2005,  the  PRC\u2019s  central  government  has  divided  the  nation \ninto  four  regions  in  the  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan.  The  current  regions  are  eastern,  central, \nwestern, and northeastern areas (Figure A-4). \n\nFigure A-4.

More \nimportantly, it helps the government to develop corresponding macroeconomic policies. For \nexample, the Development of the Western Region strategy focuses on the western regions, \nwhile the strategy to revitalize the northeastern region and other old industrial bases aims to \npromote the development of the northeastern region. The four-region division is reasonable \ngiven the  current environment, and the intra-regional disparities are  much  smaller than the \ninter-regional  disparity  (see  Figure  11).  Therefore,  we  have  analyzed  regional  disparities \nbased on this four-region system.  \n\n \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\nAPPENDIX B: MEASURES OF REGIONAL INEQUALITY \n\nThe measurement of regional disparities is an arduous task; no single statistical measure is \nable to capture its myriad dimensions. This paper has applied some widely used measures \nto  highlight  various  dimensions  of  regional  income  inequality.  The  selected  measures  are \nbriefly described in the following paragraphs. \n\n1) Maximum to minimum ratio (MMR) \n\nA comparison of the per capita GRDP (gross regional domestic product, or other index such \nas per capita consumption or per capita income) of the region with the highest income to that \nof the region with the lowest income (minimum per capita GRDP) provides a measure of the \nrange  of  the  disparity  between  them.  Maximum  to  minimum  ratio  (MMR)  provides  a  quick, \neasy to comprehend, and politically powerful measure of regional income inequality. \n\n2)  The  Gini  index  is  widely  used  in  the  inequality  literature.  Following  Shankar  and  Shah \n(2003), we compute the unweighted Gini index as follows: \n\n=\n\nG\nu\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\nwhere \n\n\u22c5\n\n\uf8f6\n1\n\uf8f7\n2\ny\n\uf8f8\nu\niy  and \n\nn\n\nn\n\nj\n\ni\n\ny\n\n, \n\n\u2212\n\ny\ni\n\n1)\n\n\u2211\u2211\n\n1\n(\nn n\n\u2212\njy  are the GRDPs per capita of regions i and j, respectively. n is the number \nuy  is  the  unweighted  mean  of  the  per  capita  GRDPs.  Gu  varies  from  0  for \n\nj\n\nof  regions,  and \nperfect equality to 1 for perfect inequality. \n\nThe unweighted Gini index takes every region in the same magnitude, i.e., every region was \ntaken  as  one  equal  unit  regardless  of  its  population  size.  The  weighted  Gini  index,  which \nweights the regions\u2019 per capita GRDPs based on their respective population proportions, is \ncalculated as shown below: \n\nn\n\nn\n\n=\n\nG\nu\n\n\uf8eb\n1\n\uf8ec\n2\ny\n\uf8ed\nwhere  y GDP P\n=\n\n\u2211\u2211\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n\u22c5\n\nj\n\ni\n\ny\ni\n\n\u2212\n\ny\n\nj\n\nPP\ni\nj\n2\nP\n\n, \n\n is  the  national  mean  per  capita  GDP. \n\njP  are  the  populations  of \nregions  i  and  j,  respectively.  P  is  the  national  population,  and  n  the  number  of  regions.  Gu \n*P  represents the \nvaries from 0 for perfect equality to 1 - \n*P  is small compared to P, i.e., if \npopulation of the region which produced the total GDP. If \nthe region with a small proportion of the population produced all the GDP, then the value for \nperfect inequality would approach 1. \n\nP P  for perfect inequality, where \n*(\n\niP  and \n\n)\n\n \n3) Another commonly used measure of inequality is the Theil index. Following Theil (1967), it \nis computed as follows:  \n\nTheil T\n\n_\n\n\u03b3= \u2211\n\ni\n\ni\n\n\u03b3\nlog i\np\ni\n\n, \n\ni\u03b3  is the GDP share of region i and \n\nip  is the population share of region i. For equal \nwhere \nper capita GRDPs, i.e., with GRDPs proportional to regional populations, this index takes a \n)\niP P , \nvalue of 0. For a case where region i produces the entire GDP, Theil becomes \n\nlog\n\n(\n\n34 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 85 \n \n\n \n\nShantong Li and Zhaoyuan Xu \n\niP  is the population of region i. Note here \nwhere P is the total population of the country, and \nthat as the population  share of region i decreases, Theil  increases if region  i produces the \nentire GDP. \n\nSimilar  to  the \n\npopulation share as a weight, i.e., \n\n_\n\nTheil T  index,  we  can  compute  the \np\nlog i\n\u03b3\ni\n\nTheil L\n\n= \u2211\n\np\ni\n\n_\n\ni\n\n. \n\nTheil L  index,  which  uses  the \n\n_\n\nCompared to other measures of inequality such as Gini, CV (coefficient of variation), and Rw \n(relative  mean  deviation),  Theil  indexes  satisfy  several  desirable  properties,  i.e.,  they  are \nadditively  decomposable,  and  satisfy  mean  independence  (or  income-zero-homogeneity), \nthe  principle  of  population  replication  (or  population-size  independence),  and  the  Pigou-\nDalton  principle  of  transfers  (Bourguignon,  1979;  Shorrocks,  1980,  Akita  et  al.,  1999).  An \ninequality index is said to be additively decomposable if total inequality can be written as the \nsum  of  between-group  and  within-group  inequality.  Mean  independence  implies  that  the \nindex  remains  unchanged  if  everyone\u2019s  expenditure  is  changed  by  the  same  proportion, \nwhile population-size independence means that the index remains unchanged if the number \nof households at each expenditure level is changed by the same proportion, i.e., the index \ndepends  only  on  the  relative  population  frequencies  at  each  expenditure  level,  not  the \nabsolute population frequencies. Finally, the Pigou-Dalton principle of transfers implies that \nany  expenditure  transfer  from  a  richer  to  a  poorer  household  that  does  not  reverse  their \nrelative ranks in expenditures reduces the value of the index. \n\nSuppose  that  the  regions  are  grouped  into  mutually  exclusive  and  collectively  exhaustive \ngroups and each group can be divided into several small sub-regions.

We find that compared with the 1990s, the expansive trend of inter-provincial \ndisparities  has  slowed  down  and  started  to  decrease  somewhat  since  2000.  In  2004  and \n2005,  some  statistical  indicators,  such  as  per  capita  GDP  and  per  capita  household \nconsumption  at  current  prices,  show  that  regional  disparities  have  declined  to  a  certain \nextent.  In  addition  to  the  great  disparity  among  provinces,  disparities  within  provinces  are \nalso  very common  in  the  PRC.  Judged  by  some  measurement indexes,  income  disparities \nwithin many provinces have even exceeded inter-provincial disparities. \n", "The  results  of  decomposing  the  regional  disparity  into  within-group  and  between-group \ncomponents  suggested  that  the  urban-rural  disparities  are  the  main  source  of  regional \ndisparities.  The  results  further  suggested  that  disparities  among  the  PRC\u2019s  four  regions, \nespecially between the eastern region and the other regions, are mainly to blame for inter-\nprovincial disparities.  \n", "Finally, this paper finds that changes in regional disparities in recent years can be attributed \nto  many  factors,  including  policies  and  regional  specific  factors  as  well  as  some  cyclical \nfactors. For this reason, we still cannot claim that the PRC\u2019s regional disparities have started \na decline that will continue.  \n", "JEL Classification: O18, R12, O47 \n", " \n"]}
