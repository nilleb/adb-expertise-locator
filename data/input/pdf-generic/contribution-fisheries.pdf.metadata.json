variety of ways, but the full value of these benefits is not reflected\nin  the  region\u2019s  statistics.\n\nRecords may be maintained, but they are not complete, or accu-\nrate,  or  comparable.  The  research  summarized  in  this  report  reaf-\nfirms the importance of this sector to the economies and societies of\nthe  Pacific  Island  countries.  The  research  reveals  that  the  full  value\nof fisheries is likely to have eluded statisticians, and therefore fisher-\nies  authorities,  government  decision  makers,  and  funding  agencies.\nBut  the  value  of  fisheries  has  never  escaped  the  fisher,  fish  trader,\nand  fish  processor.  The  difference  in  appreciation,  between  public\nand private individuals, must raise the question of whether fisheries\nare  receiving  adequate  attention  from  the  public  sector\u2014including\nthe  necessary  management  and  protection,  appropriate  research,\ndevelopment,  extension  and  training,  and  sufficient  investment.\n\nADB  will  distribute  this  report  as  widely  as  possible  to  public\nsector  fisheries  management  agencies,  planning  agencies,  statistics\noffices,  and  to  other  interested  parties.  But  it  is  my  hope  that  this\npublication  will  be  updated  soon,  in  recognition  of  this  sector\u2019s\ncontribution  to  the  economies  of  the  region.  ADB  will  continue  to\nwork with the Forum Fisheries Agency, the Secretariat of the Pacific\nCommunity,  and  the  World  Bank  in  our  efforts  to  give  the  fisheries\nsector the priority it deserves.\n\nJeremy H.

In  discussions  with  Forum  Fisheries\nAgency  (FFA)  and  the  Secretariat  of  the  Pacific  Community  (SPC),\nADB developed a concept for a study to improve the accuracy of the\nestimates of the contribution of fisheries to national economies. The\nWorld  Bank  agreed  later  to  participate  in  this  joint  activity.\n\nThe  objectives  of  the  study\n\nThe  immediate objective of the study was to use available data\nto  measure  the  economic  contribution  of  fisheries  to  the  economies\nof  Pacific  Island  nations.  It  was  recognized,  however,  that  a  thor-\nough  quantification  of  the  economic  benefits  of  fisheries  would  re-\nquire  more  than  a  short  intervention. Accordingly,  the  longer-term\nobjectives of the study were set as follows:\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\nTo  improve  the  accuracy  of  measuring  the  contribution  of  fish-\neries  to  national  economies;\nTo  generate  interest  among  government  fisheries  agencies  in\nmeasuring  the  economic  contribution  of  fisheries  to  national\neconomies;  and\nTo  provide  information  that  could  eventually  be  used  to\nquantify  the  benefits  of  the  various  fisheries  management\noptions.\n\nThe  target  audience\n\nThe  primary  target  audiences  of  this  study  are  Pacific  Island\nfisheries  agency  staff  interested  in  economics  and  statistics  agency\nstaff  interested  in  fisheries.      In  addition,  the  study  is  also  intended\nfor  economists  and  national  accountants  working  in  the  Pacific\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries_prelims_new.p65\n\n19\n\n7/4/02, 6:52 PM\n\n\fxx\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\nIsland  region,  and  regional  and  international  organizations  with  a\ngeneral  interest  on  fisheries  in  the  Pacific.\n\nThe  scope  of  the  study\n\nIt  was  decided  that  the  study  should  initially  focus  on  the\nfishing  contribution  to  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  including\nexamining the methods used by national authorities to calculate this\ncontribution, commenting on the validity of these methods, and pro-\nducing an independent estimation of the fishing contribution to  GDP.\nThe study also compiled  information on the specific economic ben-\nefits  of  fisheries,  including  contributions  to  employment,  exports,\ngovernment  revenue,  and  nutrition.\n\nNational  accounts  and  GDP\n\nNational  accounts  are  an  accounting  framework  used  to  mea-\nsure economic activity in a country. Most of the countries in the Pa-\ncific publish national accounts. The method used in each country is\nbased  on  a  standardized  System  of  National  Accounts  (SNA)  that\nwas originally introduced by the United Nations in 1953.  Typically,\ngovernments,  international  agencies  and  private  corporations  use\nnational  accounts  to  monitor  developments  within  an  economy.  In\nparticular,  they  are  used  to:\n\n(cid:127) Monitor  changes  in  economic  activity;\n(cid:127) Make  cross-country  comparisons;\nPrepare  time-series  analysis;\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\nIdentify  functional  relationships;\n(cid:127) Determine  aid  eligibility/requirements.\n\nNational accounts provide several measures of activity, and the\ntwo  indicators  that  are  most  commonly  quoted  are  GDP  and  gross\nnational  income  (GNI)\u2014previously  known  as  gross  national  prod-\nuct (GNP). GDP measures the level of domestic economic activity, or\nthe  economic  activity  that  takes  place  within  a  country  during  a\nspecified  period  of  time.  GNI  is  the  measure  of  national  economic\nactivity,  which  includes  domestic  activity  (GDP)  plus  the  net  return\nto  the  country  from  overseas  investments  and  remittances.\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries_prelims_new.p65\n\n20\n\n7/4/02, 6:52 PM\n\n\fReferences\nExecutive Summary\n\nxxi\nxxi\n\nApproaches  to  compiling  national  accounts\n\nThree  different  methods  are  used  to  compile  the  national\naccounts  of  a  country:  the  production  approach,  the  income\napproach,  and  the  expenditure  approach.\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\nThe production approach views the economy from the perspec-\ntive  of  production.  The  approach  measures  the  gross  output  of\neach producer then deducts the value of the goods and services\npurchased  from  other  producers  and  used  in  the  production\nprocess.\nThe income approach measures the major components of value-\nadded:  employee  compensation  (wages  and  other  remunera-\ntion),  operating  surplus  (company  profits),  and  indirect  taxes\nnet of subsidies. The sum of these components is the value-added\nto  GDP.\nThe expenditure approach is based on the final use of the output\nproduced.  It  sums  the  expenditures  of  the  main  participants  in\nthe economy: government final consumption, private final con-\nsumption,  gross  capital  formation,  and  net  exports.\n\nValuation  of  subsistence  production\n\nAn important aspect of the production approach is the calcula-\ntion  of  the  value  of  production.  This  can  be  particularly  difficult\nwhen it is necessary to estimate the value of subsistence production.\nWhile there are several methods that could be used to value  subsis-\ntence production in this report, \u201cfarm gate\u201d pricing  has been used.\nThis  method  uses  the  market  price  of  the  product  less  the  cost  of\ngetting  that  product  to  market.\n\nCategorizing  fishing  activity  for  national  account  compilation\n\nThe  compilers  of  national  accounts  must  strike  a  balance\nbetween  their  desire  for  accuracy  and  the  limitations  on  the  time\nand effort they can dedicate to collecting and analyzing data. In the\ncase of fishing, striking this balance means that they are usually lim-\nited  to  using  generalized  estimates  of  income  or  production.  The\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries_prelims_new.p65\n\n21\n\n7/4/02, 6:52 PM\n\n\fxxii\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\nminimum level of aggregation to be used in the Pacific Islands  should\ndivide  fishing  into  three  classes  of  activity:  large-scale  commercial\nfishing, small-scale commercial fishing, and subsistence fishing.   Each\nof  these  three  categories  can  be  analyzed  using  the  approach  most\nappropriate  for  the  particular  category.\n\nValue-added  ratio\n\nThe production approach to estimating the contribution of fish-\ning to GDP requires two basic sets of data: (i) value of gross output\nof fishing, and (ii) intermediate costs. It is usually convenient to ex-\npress the intermediate costs as a proportion of the gross output.  This\nratio  is  called  the  value-added  ratio.  In  this  report  the  value-added\nratios  used  range  from  40%  for  some  offshore  fishing  to  90%  for\nnonmotorized  subsistence  fishing.\n\nOfficial  data  on  the  contribution  of  fishing  to  GDP\n\nAccording  to  current  official  data  in  Pacific  Island  countries,\nthe percentage contribution of fishing to GDP in 1999 (or latest prior\nyear  available)  ranges  from  0.6%  in  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG)  to\n12.0%  in  Kiribati.\n\nRe-estimation  of  the  contribution  of  fishing  to  GDP\n\nGiven the complexity of the issues to be addressed and the large\ndifference  in  the  accuracy  of  the  official  fishing  estimates  made  in\nthe  Pacific  Island  countries,  it  was  important  for  the  study  to    re-\nestimate the fishing contribution to GDP  using a consistent method\nacross all countries. It was believed that, at the very least, these esti-\nmates  would  provide  useful  comparators  for  the  compilers  of  na-\ntional  accounts.  In  addition,  it  was  anticipated  that  the  review  of\nthe  different  methods  and  approaches  used  in  each  country  would\nprovide useful insights into the effectiveness of alternative approaches\nto  national  accounting.\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries_prelims_new.p65\n\n22\n\n7/4/02, 6:52 PM\n\n\fReferences\nExecutive Summary\n\nxxiii\nxxiii\n\nComparison  of  official  and  re-estimates\n\nThe  comparison  between  the  official  and  the  new  estimates  of\nfishing  contribution  to  GDP  is  presented  on  Figure  1  below.    The\nlargest difference was found in Kiribati, Palau and Federated States\nof  Micronesia  (FSM),  where  the  new  estimates  nearly  doubled  or\ntripled  the  official  figures.  By  contrast,  this  study  lowered  the  esti-\nmate of fishing contribution to GDP in Marshall Islands, Samoa and,\nto a lesser extent, Cook Islands. On average, the new estimates indi-\ncated a higher contribution of fishing to GDPs than reported by na-\ntional  statistics  (7.0%  vs.  5.4%  across  all  countries).\n\nFigure  1: Comparison  of  Official  and  New  Estimates  of\nFishing  Contribution  to  the  GDP  of  Pacific  Island\nCountries,  1999\n,\n\nOfficial Contribution\nRe-Estimate Contribution \n\n%\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nP\nN\nG\n\ni\n\nN\nu\ne\n\nN\na\nu\nr\nu\n\nV\na\nn\nu\na\nt\nu\n\nF\n\nl\n\ni\nj\ni\n \nI\ns\na\nn\nd\ns\n\nl\n\nI\ns\na\nn\nd\ns\n\nM\na\nr\ns\nh\na\n\nl\nl\n\nS\na\nm\no\na\n\nT\nu\nv\na\nu\n\nl\n\nT\no\nn\ng\na\n\nP\na\na\nu\n\nl\n\nF\nS\nM\n\nl\n\nI\ns\na\nn\nd\ns\n\nl\n\nS\no\no\nm\no\nn\n\nK\n\ni\nr\ni\nb\na\nt\ni\n\nC\no\no\nk\n \nI\ns\na\nn\nd\ns\n\nl\n\nMajor  reasons  for  difference  in  estimates  of  fishing  contribution\n\nIn some countries, notably FSM and PNG, the difference in esti-\nmates  is  primarily  due  to  subsistence  fishing  not  being  included  in\nthe official figures. In other countries, in particular Palau, the differ-\nences are primarily due to the methods used.

In  Samoa,  for  ex-\nample,  subsistence  production  was  valued  at  the  full  market  value,\nrather  than  at  \u201cfarm  gate\u201d  prices.  Cook  Islands,  Niue,  Tonga,  and\nTuvalu all compile soundly based national accounts that include rea-\nsonable  estimates  of  fishing  contribution.  Nauru  and  the  Solomon\nIslands  have  weaknesses  in  compiling  national  accounts.\n\nCommon  difficulties  associated  with  calculating  the\ncontribution of fishing to GDP\n\nThe common difficulties found in estimating the contribution of\n\nfishing  to  GDP  in  many  Pacific  Island  countries  include:\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\nFisheries technical input. There is a lack of coordination between\nfisheries  agencies  and  statistical  agencies  in  the  calculation  of\nfishing  input.\nTreatment  of  subsistence  fisheries.  There  is  often  a  lack  of  data\non subsistence fisheries and difficulties in isolating fishing from\nother  subsistence  activities.\nFish  processing.  Because  in  the  SNA  scheme  the  processing  of\nfish is outside the \u201cfishing\u201d sector, it is often not possible to iso-\nlate  the  contribution  of  this  important  fishing-related  activity\nfrom other forms of food processing.\nExport  data.  Official  export  figures  in  the  Pacific  Island  coun-\ntries  characteristically  undervalue  exported  commodities,  espe-\ncially  fisheries  products.\nEconomics of small-scale fisheries. Data on small-scale fisheries\nare  often  scarce,  as  is  technical  assistance  for  its  analysis.\nLack of \u201cchampions\u201d.

The  FSM\nranks third by volume and first by value.\nThe  Fiji  Islands  appears  to  have  the  largest  non-tuna  produc-\ntion, in terms of both volume and value.\nThe  production  from  Nauru  and  Tuvalu  is  almost  entirely  re-\nlated  to  tuna  fishing.\n\nFisheries-related  employment\n\nThere  are  also  certain  observations  that  can  be  made  about\n\nemployment  in  the  fisheries  sector:\n\nThe  importance  of  fisheries  in  the  subsistence  economy  seems\nto  be  strongly  related  to  the  type  of  island.    In  decreasing  im-\nportance,  atolls,  islands,  and  large  high  islands  are  associated\nwith  very  different  levels  of  significance.  This  pattern  is  some-\nwhat altered by PNG with its important freshwater subsistence\nfisheries.\nThe importance of formal employment in fisheries  seems to be\nrelated  more  to  business  conditions  than  to  island  type.  Most\nformal  employment  in  fisheries  appears  to  be  tuna-related.\nThe importance of women employment in fisheries is generally\nunderstated due to (i) the practice of classifying activity accord-\ning  to  a  person\u2019s  \u201cmain  unpaid  activity,\u201d  which  masks  the\nimportance  of  secondary  activities\u2014e.g.  for  many  women,\nchildcare  is  often  the  \u201cmain  unpaid  activity\u201d  so  any  fishing\nactivity, even if it is a substantial amount of activity, is not duly\nreported;  and  (ii)  placing  commercial  fish  processing  (where\nmany  women  are  employed)  in  the  manufacturing  sector.\nWhere commercial fish processing occurs (canning, loining) and\nwhen  this  is  attributed  to  the  fisheries  sector,  the  increase  in\nfisheries  employment  is  remarkable.\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries_prelims_new.p65\n\n26\n\n7/4/02, 6:52 PM\n\n\fReferences\nExecutive Summary\n\nxxvii\nxxvii\n\nFisheries  exports\n\nThe  most  notable  feature  of  fishery  trade  data  in  the  Pacific\nIslands is the underestimation of the value of fisheries exports.

It is\nrecommended  that,  in  these  countries,  the  compilers  of  national\naccounts  carefully  examine  and  evaluate  the  data,  the  assumptions,\nand  the  methods  used.\n\nThe accuracy of the estimate of fishing contribution to GDP could\nbe improved with a closer liaison between the fisheries and the sta-\ntistics  agencies.  The  fisheries  agencies  are  in  a  position  to  provide\ninformation on new developments, technical insight, and recent data,\nall  of  which  could  improve  GDP  estimates.  This  cooperation,  how-\never,  rarely  occurs  in  Pacific  Island  countries.  Because  the  fisheries\nagencies  have  a  vested  interest  in  assuring  that  the  importance  of\ntheir  sector  is  not  underestimated,  they  should  take  the  lead  in\nimproving  the  liaison  between  their  agency  and  the  compilers  of\nnational  accounts.\n\nOne  of  the  factors  that  often  result  in  an  underestimation  of\nfisheries  contribution to national economies  is the limited informa-\ntion available on the production of small-scale fisheries. Throughout\nmost of the region, the statistics on  small-scale fisheries are incom-\nplete,  inaccurate  and,  in  some  cases,  absent.  Given  this  reality,  it  is\nrecommended  that  maximum  use  be  made  of  survey  opportunities\noutside the fisheries sector.  At little cost, production information on\nsmall-scale  fisheries  could  be  collected  through  such  tools  as  the\nnational  census,  nutrition  surveys,  agriculture  censuses,  household\nincome  and  expenditure  surveys  (HIES),  and  poverty  studies.\n\nIn many countries, the underestimation of the value of fisheries\nexports in official customs statistics is a major source of error in the\ncalculation of fisheries contribution to national economies.  It appears\nthat the export information could be worse in fisheries than in most\nother sectors.  In countries where this problem is especially acute, it\nis  recommended  that  export  valuation  be  based  on  a  broader  spec-\ntrum  of  information  than  what  is    provided  by  customs.\n\nAdditional  information  on  the  economics  of  small-scale  fish-\neries  would  contribute  to  improving  measurement  of  the  fisheries\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries_prelims_new.p65\n\n30\n\n7/4/02, 6:53 PM\n\n\fReferences\nExecutive Summary\n\nxxxi\nxxxi\n\ncontribution  to  GDP.    Studies  to  gather  the  required  data  need  not\nbe  complex  but  should  cover  the  major  small-scale  commercial  and\nsubsistence  fisheries.\n\nWhere  the  compilers  of  national  accounts  have  access  to  com-\nprehensive  and  detailed  information  on  the  income/expenditure  of\nthe  participants  in  one  or  more  sectors  of  the  fishing  industry,  the\nincome  approach  is  the  most  appropriate  method  of  calculating  the\nfishing  contribution  to  GDP.  In  the  Pacific,  it  is,  however,  rare  for\nthis data to be available. In these circumstances, the production ap-\nproach  is  likely  to  produce  the  most  accurate  results.\n\nRegional organizations could play an important role in improv-\ning  the  measurement  of  fisheries  in  the  economies  of  their  member\ncountries.\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries_prelims_new.p65\n\n31\n\n7/4/02, 6:53 PM\n\n\fxxxii\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\n \n\n20N\n\nEQ\n\n20S\n\n \n\n40S\n\nn\no\ni\ng\ne\nR\n \ns\nd\nn\na\nl\ns\nI\n \nc\ni\nf\ni\nc\na\nP\n\n \ne\nh\nT\n\n \n \n \n \n \n:\n7\n \ne\nr\nu\ng\ni\nF\n\n \n\nW\n0\n2\n1\n\n \n\nW\n0\n4\n1\n\n \n\nW\n0\n6\n1\n\n \n\n0\n8\n1\n\n \n\nE\n0\n6\n1\n\n \n\nE\n0\n4\n1\n\n \n\nE\n0\n2\n1\n\nn\n\nr\ni\n\na\nc\nt\ni\nP\n\n \n\nl\n\na\ni\ns\ne\nn\ny\no\nP\nh\nc\nn\ne\nr\nF\n\n \n\n \n\ni\ni\n\na\nw\na\nH\n\n \n\nn\no\nt\ns\nn\nh\no\nJ\n\n \n\n \n\nl\nl\n\na\nh\ns\nr\na\nM\n\ns\nd\nn\na\nl\ns\nI\n\ne \nk\na\nW\n\n \n\n \n\ni\n\nm\na\nn\nM\n\ni\n\n \n \n\ni\n\na\nm\nh\nS\n \ni\nr\n\no\nT\n\n \n\n \n\nr\n\nn\ne\nh\nt\nr\no\nN\n\ns\na\nn\na\n\ni\nr\n\na\nM\n\nm \na\nu\nG\n\ns\nd\nn\na\nl\ns\nI\n\ne\nn\nL\n \n\ni\n\n \n \n\n \na\nr\ny\nm\na\nP\n\nl\n\n \n\ns\ni\nv\nr\na\nJ\n\n \n\n \nk\no\no\nC\n\n \n\ns\nd\nn\na\nl\ns\nI\n\n \nm\nA\n\na \no\nm\na\nS\n\n \n \n\n \ne\nu\nN\n\ni\n\n \n\nl\n\nu\na\ne\nk\no\nT\n\na \no\nm\na\nS\n \n\n \n\n \n\ni\n\nx\nn\ne\no\nh\nP\n\n \na\ng\nn\no\nT\n\n \n\n \nd\nn\na\nw\no\nH\n\nl\n\n \n\nr\n\ne\nk\na\nB\n&\n\n \n\n \n\n&\n \ns\ni\nl\nl\n\na\nW\n\na\nn\nu\nt\nu\nF\n \n\ni\nj\ni\n\nF\n\n \n\nl\n\nu\na\nv\nu\nT\n\n \n\ns\nI\n \n\nn\no\nm\no\no\nS\n\nl\n\n \n\n \nw\ne\nh\nt\nt\n\na\nM\n\nr\n\ne\nt\nn\nu\nH\n&\n\n \n\n \nu\nt\na\nu\nn\na\nV\n\nl\n\nk\no\n\nf\nr\n\no\nN\n\n \n\n \n\ni\n\n \na\nn\no\nd\ne\na\nC\n\nl\n\nw\ne\nN\n\n \n \n \n\na\n\ni\nl\n\na\n\nr\nt\ns\nu\nA\n\ni\nt\n\na\nb\n\ni\nr\ni\nK\n\nr\n\n \nu\nu\na\nN\n\ni\n\n \n\n \na\ne\nn\nu\nG\nw\ne\nN\na\nu\np\na\nP\n\n \n\n \n\na\ni\ns\ne\nn\no\nc\nM\n\nr\n\ni\n\n \nf\n\no\n \ns\ne\nt\na\nt\nS\n \nd\ne\nt\na\ne\nd\ne\nF\n\nr\n\n \nu\na\na\nP\n\nl\n\n20N \n\nEQ\n\n20S \n\n40S  \n\n \n\nl\n\nd\nn\na\na\ne\nZ\n \nw\ne\nN\n\n \n\nW\n0\n2\n1\n\n \n\nW\n0\n4\n1\n\n \n\nW\n0\n6\n1\n\n \n\n0\n8\n1\n\n \n\nE\n0\n6\n1\n\n \n\nE\n0\n4\n1\n\n \n\nE\n0\n2\n1\n\n.\na\ne\nr\na\n \nl\na\nc\ni\nt\ns\ni\nt\na\nt\ns\n \ns\ne\ni\nr\ne\nh\ns\ni\nf\n \n\nC\nP\nS\n\n \ne\nh\nt\n \ns\nt\ni\n\nm\n\ni\nl\n\ne\nd\n \ne\nn\n\ni\nl\n \nk\nr\na\nd\n \ne\nh\nT\n\n \n \n.\n)\n\nC\nP\nS\n\n(\n \ny\nt\ni\nn\nu\nm\nm\no\nC\n\n \nc\ni\nf\ni\nc\na\nP\n\n \ne\nh\nt\n \nf\no\n \nt\na\ni\nr\na\nt\ne\nr\nc\ne\nS\n\n \n:\ne\nc\nr\nu\no\nS\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries_prelims_new.p65\n\n32\n\n7/4/02, 6:53 PM\n\n\fReferences\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn  early  2001,  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  expressed  the\ngrowing  concern  that  the  importance  of  fisheries  to  Pacific  Island\neconomies is not fully appreciated by the countries of the region nor\nby the donor community. In discussions with Forum Fisheries Agency\n(FFA) and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), ADB dev-\neloped  a  concept  for  a  project  to  improve  the  accuracy  of  the  esti-\nmates  of  the  contribution  of  fisheries  to  national  economies.  At  a\nlater  stage,  World  Bank  agreed  to  participate  in  this  joint  activity.\n\nThe  partners  in  this  activity  established  that  the  immediate\nobjective  of  the  project  would  be  to  measure  the  economic  contri-\nbution  of  fisheries  to  the  economies  of  Pacific  Island  nations  from\navailable  data.  It  was  recognized  that  a  thorough  quantification  of\nthe  economic  benefits  of  fisheries  would  require  more  than  a  short\nintervention. Accordingly, longer-term objectives were set as follows:\n\n(i) To help improve the accuracy of measuring the contribution of\n\nfisheries  to  national  economies;\n\n(ii) To  generate  interest  among  government  fisheries  agencies  in\nmeasuring  the  economic  contribution  of  fisheries  to  their  na-\ntional  economies;\n\n(iii) To provide information which could eventually be used to quan-\ntify  the  benefits  of  the  various  fisheries  management  options.\n\nIt was decided that the project should initially focus on the fish-\neries contribution to gross domestic product (GDP), including exam-\nining  the  methods  used  by  national  authorities  in  the  calculation  of\nthis contribution, commenting on the validity of these methods, and\nproducing  an  independent  estimation  of  the  fishing  contribution  to\nGDP. A  need  was  also  recognized  for  a  compilation  of  information\non  the  specific  economic  benefits  of  fisheries,  including  contribu-\ntions  to  employment,  exports,  government  revenue,  and  nutrition.\nTo  implement  the  project,  two  consultants  were  recruited:  (i)  a\nfisheries specialist was contracted by ADB, and (ii) a macroeconomist\nwas  contracted  by  World  Bank.  The  information  used  in  compiling\nthis  report  was  collected  from  May  to  September  2001.

Information from those coun-\ntries came either from personal contact with government officials at\nregional  meetings  or  from  telephone  and  e-mail  contact.  In  most\ncountries,  it  was  possible  to  obtain  data  from  the  staff  of  both  the\nfisheries  and  statistics  agencies.  However,  data  coverage  was  sub-\nstantially  better  in  countries  that  were  actually  visited.\n\nAlthough it would be desirable for the study to be as broad as to\ncover the full fisheries sector of the Pacific Island region, it was neces-\nsary  to  limit  the  scope  of  the  exercise.  The  period  covered  is  gener-\nally  the  mid-  and  late-1990s,  with  1999  being  used  in  several  com-\nparisons.  Coverage  is  limited  to  the  14  independent  Pacific  Island\ncountries.  While  it  is  recognized  that  freshwater  fisheries  are  sub-\nstantial in at least one of the countries, the present study is limited to\nmarine  fisheries.\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n2\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\n\n3\n\nNational  Accounts  and\nAssociated  Issues\n\nTo those involved in fisheries, the importance of the industry to\nthe  economy  is  obvious:  (i)  exports  of  fish  and  fish  products  earn\nforeign  exchange  which  helps  provide  the  resources  needed  to  pay\nfor crucial imports; (ii) it provides employment for a substantial num-\nber of people; (iii) the catch of commercial and artisanal fishers pro-\nvide  an  important  source  of  food  for  the  community;  and  (iv)  the\nfish, shellfish, seaweed and other aquatic resources collected by fami-\nlies are a crucial part of their livelihood.\n\nWhile the importance of fisheries is self-evident to those involved\nin  the  industry,  it  is  far  less  obvious  to  many  others.  The  boats  that\ncatch fish for export  are often at  sea or moored at wharves that are\naway  from  the  public  gaze;  fishes  are  purchased  in  markets  and\nretail stores where there is little to link them to the fishing industry;\nand  the  collection  of  marine  and  other  aquatic  products  for  home\nconsumption  is  often  taken  for  granted.\n\nOf itself, this lack of awareness need not be a problem. It is not\nnecessary  for  everyone  to  fully  appreciate  the  significance  of  any\nactivity  in  the  economy.  However,  when  that  lack  of  appreciation\nextends to policymakers, planners, and development agencies, it can\nmean  that  fisheries  development  receives  a  lower  priority  than  it\ndeserves.  One  of  the  keys  to  ensuring  that  the  fisheries  sector  re-\nceives  the  level  of  support  warranted  is  to  make  certain  that  the\nsector\u2019s  contribution  to  the  economy  is  accurately  portrayed  in  a\ncountry\u2019s  national  accounts.\n\nNational  Accounts\n\nWhat  are  they?\n\nNational accounts are an accounting framework used to measure\nthe current economic activity in a country.1 Most of the countries in\n\n1 Those readers who would like a more comprehensive description of national accounting will\nfind it well covered in most macroeconomic textbooks. In addition, the supporting documenta-\ntion to the System of National Accounts (SNA) 1993 provides a comprehensive description of\nthe  procedures  and  conventions  used  in  preparing  national  accounts.\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n3\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f4\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\nthe Pacific publish national accounts. The method used in each coun-\ntry  is  based  on  a  standardized  System  of  National Accounts  (SNA)\nthat  was  originally  introduced  by  the  United  Nations  in  1953.  The\nSNA  has  since  been  revised,  refined,  and  was  republished  in  1993\n(SNA  1993).\n\nWhat  are  they  used  for?\n\nTypically,  governments,  international  agencies,  and  private  cor-\nporations use national accounts to monitor developments within an\neconomy.  In  particular,  they  are  used  to:\n\n(i) Monitor  changes  in  economic  activity;\n(ii) Make  cross-country  comparisons;\n(iii) Prepare  time-series  analysis;\n(iv)\n(v) Determine  aid  eligibility/requirements.\n\nIdentify  functional  relationships;  and\n\nNational accounts are compiled for a succession of time periods,\nthus  providing  a  continuing  flow  of  information  that  is  indispens-\nable for the monitoring, analysis and evaluation of the performance\nof an economy and its components over time. They usually provide\ninformation  not  only  about  economic  activities  but  also  about  the\nlevels of an economy\u2019s productive assets and the wealth of its inhab-\nitants  at  particular  points  of  time.\n\nIn  practice,  while  the  methods  used  to  construct  national\naccounts  are  based  upon  a  standardized  system,  there  are  different\napproaches  that  can  be  used  and  the  quality  of  the  data  available\ncan  vary  significantly.  There  may  be  substantial  differences  in  the\nmethods  used  by  each  country,  so  care  should  be  exercised  when\nmaking cross-country comparisons. In a few cases, the methods used\nwithin  a  country  have  changed;  hence,  inter-temporal  comparisons\nfor  those  countries  should  also  be  approached  with  caution.\n\nWhat do they show?\n\nWhile  national  accounts  provide  several  measures  of  activity,\nthe  two  indicators  that  are  most  commonly  quoted  are  GDP  and\ngross national income (GNI).2 GDP  measures  the  level  of  domestic\n\n2 Prior  to  the  1993  revision  of  the  System  of  National  Accounts,  Gross  National  Income  was\nknown as Gross National Product (GNP).\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n4\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nNational Accounts and Associated Issues\n\n5\n5\n\neconomic  activity\u2014i.e.,  economic  activity  that  took  place  within  a\ncountry  during  a  specified  period  of  time.  GNI  is  the  measure  of\nnational  economic  activity,  which  includes  domestic  activity  (GDP)\nplus  the  net  return  to  the  country  from  overseas  investments  and\nremittances. In the case of fishing, these returns from overseas include\nincome from fishing access fees from nonresident fishing by foreign\noperators.  This  income  is  classified  as  \u201crental  income.\u201d\n\nTypically,  a  comprehensive  set  of  national  accounts  will  show\nthe contribution to GDP by each of the major sectors in the economy,\nplus  the  distribution  of  income  and  expenditure  between  the  vari-\nous classes of enterprise in the economy. For example, GDP is normally\ndivided  between  major  sectors  including  manufacturing,  transport,\nwholesale  and  retail,  agriculture  and  other  primary  industries,  etc.\nSimilarly,  GDP  can  also  be  divided  among  various  classes  of  enter-\nprises  including  government,  private  nonprofit,  corporations,  etc.\n\nIt  is  important  to  note  that,  although  a  sector\u2019s  contribution  to\nnational  GDP  may  seem  small,  it  can  be  crucially  important  to  the\nnational economy. The country of Iceland provides a good example.\nIceland\u2019s  economy  is  highly  dependent  on  fish  and  fishing.  Fishery\nproducts make up 70% of exports. Despite this importance, the fish-\ning  sector  contributes  only  13%  to  GDP.  This  is  because  many\nfishing-related  activities  are  accounted  for  in  other  sectors  such  as\nmanufacturing.  Moreover,  much  of  the  economic  activity  generated\nby  fishing,  such  as  retail  trade,  is  counted  as  value-added  in  other\nsectors.\n\nHow  are  national  accounts  constructed?\n\nThe  three  different  approaches  to  computing  the  national\naccounts  of  a  country  are:  production  approach,  income  approach,\nand  expenditure  approach.\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\nThe  production  approach  views  the  economy  from  the  per-\nspective of production. The approach measures the gross output\nof  each  producer  then  deducts  the  value  of  the  goods  and  ser-\nvices  purchased  from  other  producers  and  used  in  the  produc-\ntion  process.\nThe income approach measures the major components of value-\nadded:  employee  compensation  (wages  and  other  remunera-\ntion),  operating  surplus  (company  profits),  and  indirect  taxes\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n5\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f6\n\n(cid:127)\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\nnet of subsidies. The sum of these components is the value-added\nto  GDP.\nThe expenditure approach  is based on the final use of the out-\nput produced. It sums the expenditures of the main participants\nin  the  economy:  government  final  consumption,  private  final\nconsumption,  gross  capital  formation,  and  net  exports.\n\nGiven that all three approaches are derived from the same data,\nby  definition,  the  GDP  calculated  by  each  should  be  identical.  In\npractice,  it  is  often  difficult  to  measure  everything  with  equal  reli-\nability. This means that there may be differences between the results\ngenerated by each approach. However, these differences are seldom\nsignificant.\n\nDefinitions  and  Conventions\n\nAs with any system, a set of procedures and conventions is used\nin  compiling  national  accounts.  The  nature  and  application  of  these\nprocedures  and  conventions  must  be  taken  into  account  when  in-\nterpreting  national  accounts.\n\nProductive  Activity\n\nOne  of  the  most  basic  issues  in  the  preparation  of  national\naccounts  is  the  nature  of  activities  that  are  included  in  the  estima-\ntion  of  domestic  product.  In  particular,  any  goods  or  services  that\nare produced by a resident of a country for sale are included. Goods\nand  services  that  are  for  sale  are  known  as  market  production.\n\nService  activities  that  are  for  personal  or  households\u2019  own  con-\nsumption  are  not  included  in  the  calculation  of  national  accounts.\nFor  example,  house  cleaning  is  not  included  if  carried  out  by  the\nfamily.  These  goods  and  services  are  known  as  nonmarket  produc-\ntion  or  subsistence  production.  However,  if  goods  produced  for\nown consumption could reasonably be sold, they are included in the\nnational  accounts.  Subsistence  fishing  is  an  example.  While  the  fish\nmay have been caught for a family\u2019s own consumption, the conven-\ntion  assumes  that  the  fish  could  have  been  sold  and,  therefore,  it\nshould  be  treated  as  adding  value  to  the  economy.  Clearly,  this  can\nbe a significant issue in fisheries in the Pacific Island countries where\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n6\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nNational Accounts and Associated Issues\n\n7\n7\n\nlarge numbers of households rely on the harvest of aquatic resources\nfor food and other uses. 3\n\nGoods  and  Services\n\nResidency\n\nGoods are physical products such as machinery, food, housing,\nand  infrastructure.  Services  include  activities  like  medical  advice,\nhairdressing,  policing,  and  consultancy.\n\nThe nature and extent of residency is a core concept of the SNA.\nIt defines what shall be counted as domestic product. For goods and\nservices to be included in the domestic product of a particular coun-\ntry,  a  resident  of  that  country  must  produce  them. A  resident  is  an\nindividual or enterprise whose \u201ccenter of economic interest\u201d is within\nthe  country.  The  \u201ccenter  of  economic  interest\u201d  is  determined  by  the\nfollowing  tests:\n\n(i) Do  residents  of  the  country,  in  whose  area  the  fishing  activity\noccurs, get significant factor payments (i.e., wage or operating\nsurplus)  from  the  activity?\n\n(ii) Does  the  government  of  the  country  or  the  individual  or  the\nbusiness  entity  located  in  the  country,  in  whose  area  the  fish-\ning  activity  occurs,  have  a  day-to-day  influence  on  the  way\nthe fishing is carried out?\nIs  the  fishing  based  in  the  economic  territory  and/or  employ-\ning  local  staff?\nIs  the  fishing  an  integral  part  of  the  domestic  economy?\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\nIt is important to note that a resident need not be a citizen. The\nproduction  of  foreign  nationals  is  treated  as  domestic  product  pro-\nvided the country is the \u201ccenter of economic interest\u201d for the enter-\nprise/individual.  This  concept  is  particularly  important  in  the  case\nof fishing where many of the enterprises are mobile, and it is common\n\n3 It  has  been  estimated  that  about  75%  of  people  in  the  Pacific  Island  countries  live  in  rural\nareas  and  that  most  of  these  households  produce  or  collect  all  or  some  of  their  food  and\nhouseholds items (Population Statistics, Statistical Bulletin No. 42, South Pacific Commission,\n1995).\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n7\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f8\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\nfor vessels to be staffed by nationals from different countries. In effect,\nthis means that the product of locally-based offshore foreign vessels\nis  treated  as  domestic  product  of  the  country  from  which  they  are\noperating  regardless  of  the  nationality  of  the  crew.\n\nUnder the SNA, the standard convention is to treat activities by\na foreign operator that take place in a country for less than 12 months\nas  being  foreign  activities.  In  the  case  of  fishing,  it  is  common  for\noffshore foreign vessels to fish for only part of the year in local wa-\nters.  In  these  circumstances,  a  strict  interpretation  of  the  SNA  con-\nvention  on  \u201ctime  in  country\u201d  would  treat  these  activities  as  foreign\nand  only  include  the  license  fees  as  part  of  the  national  accounts.\nHowever,  where  the  activities  are  seasonal  and  the  main  activity  of\nthe  vessels  is  based  locally,  it  would  be  more  appropriate  to  follow\nthe  \u201ccenter  of  economic  activity\u201d  convention  and  count  their  pro-\nduction  as  domestic  product.\n\nA related issue, which is particularly important in fishing, is the\ngeographic  extent  of  the  \u201ccenter  of  economic  interest.\u201d  The  SNA\nconvention is to treat any activity as domestic provided it takes place\nwithin  the  \u201ceconomic  territory\u201d  of  the  country.  The  SNA  boundary\nfor  domestic  activity  is  not  limited  to  the  political  boundary.  It  ex-\ntends  to  include  the  \u201ceconomic  territory.\u201d  This  convention  has  par-\nticular importance for fishing, especially offshore fishing, which can\ntake place a considerable distance from the land and political bound-\naries  of  a  country.  For  example,  the  political  boundary  is  usually\nconfined  to  the  territorial  seas,  which  extend  out  to  12  miles  from\nthe  high  water  level.  In  practice,  most  countries  use  their  exclusive\neconomic  zone  (EEZ)  when  defining  the  geographic  limits  of  their\n\u201ceconomic  territory\u201d;  and  in  the  circumstances,  this  practice  is  the\nmost  appropriate.\n\nTwo  other  \u201cgeographic\u201d  issues  that  must  be  addressed  in  fish-\ning are (i) how to treat fishing activities that take place in other juris-\ndictions,  and  (ii)  how  to  treat  those  that  take  place  in  international\nwaters.\n\nWhen  the  fishing  occurs  in  the  waters  of  another  country,  the\ndetermination  of  how  to  treat  that  activity  in  the  national  accounts\ndepends  upon  the  duration  of  the  activity  and  its  \u201ccenter  of  eco-\nnomic  activity.\u201d  The  SNA  indicates  that  temporary  work  in  a  for-\neign  country  should  be  treated  as  domestic  product  in  the  home\ncountry  (the  center  of  economic  activity)  of  the  entity  carrying  out\nthe  job.  For  example,  the  income  earned  by  a  consultant  who\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n8\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nNational Accounts and Associated Issues\n\n9\n9\n\nnormally resides in the Fiji Islands and undertakes a short-term con-\ntract  in  Samoa  would  be  treated  as  Fiji  domestic  product,  i.e.  it  is\ntantamount  to  an  export  (of  services).  SNA,  Section  6.239  states:\n\nIt should be noted, however, that GDP is not intended to measure the\nproduction  taking  place  within  the  geographical  boundary  of  the\neconomic territory. Some of the production of a resident producer\nmay take place abroad, while some of the production taking place\nwithin the geographical boundary of the economy may be carried out\nby non-resident producer units. For example, a resident producer\nmay have teams of employees working abroad temporarily on the\ninstallation, repair or servicing of equipment. This output is an export\nof a resident producer and the productive activity does not contribute\nto the GDP of the country in which it takes places. Thus, the distinc-\ntion between resident and non-resident institutional units is crucial\nto the definition and coverage of GDP.\n\nThis  being  the  case  and  in  the  absence  of  any  indication  to  the\ncontrary  such  as  the  formal  relocation  of  the  operation,  fishing\nactivity of less than 12 months in foreign waters should be treated as\ndomestic product in the home country of the vessel owner/operator.\nFollowing the same convention, fishing that takes place in inter-\nnational waters may be domestic product of a country provided the\noperation is carried out by a resident and is temporary in nature. In\nsome  circumstances,  fishing  carried  out  in  international  waters\ncould become a particularly perplexing problem for the compilers of\nnational  accounts.  Where  a  fleet  operates  in  international  waters\nmost  of  the  time,  including  transshipping  and  re-supply,  the  ques-\ntion  of  whether  to  allocate  the  production  as  domestic  or  national\nproduct  becomes  an  issue.\n\nIt is difficult to set strict rules since each situation is different. In\npractice,  the  compilers  of  national  accounts  will  make  judgments\nabout  where  to  allocate  production  of  fleets  that  occurs  on  the\n\u201cboundaries\u201d  of  countries  and  nationality.\n\nValuation\n\nIn  all  cases,  national  accounts  are  reported  in  monetary  terms.\nUsually the local currency is used and, almost always, the accounts\nare presented in current market (nominal) values and constant (real)\nvalues.  Current  market  values  use  the  value  of  the  currency  at  the\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n9\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f10\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\ntime  of  measurement.  Constant  values  are  indexed  to  the  price  lev-\nels  of  a  specified  year  so  as  to  remove  the  effects  of  price  inflation\nand  thereby  allow  the  comparison  of  real  changes  over  time.  It  is\nalso  common  for  the  international  agencies  such  as  ADB,  Interna-\ntional Monetary Fund (IMF), United Nations (UN), and World Bank\nto  produce  national  accounts  using  the  equivalent  value  of  a  con-\nvertible  currency,  usually  the  United  States  dollar  (US$).  This  prac-\ntice makes it easier to do cross-country comparisons and to track the\nchanges  in  each  country\u2019s  international  competitiveness.\n\nAn important valuation convention that is particularly relevant\nfor  fishing  is  the  treatment  of  nonmarket  household  production\n(subsistence).  Since  by  definition  these  items  are  not  sold  and  the\nquantity  produced  is  seldom  recorded,  it  is  necessary  to  make\nassumptions  about  their  value.  It  is  common  practice  to  value  non-\nmarket household production conservatively and, in some cases, pro-\nduction  for  own  consumption  is  not  even  included  in  the  national\naccounts.\n\nAssets\n\nIn the SNA, assets are restricted to things that are produced by\nan  economic  activity.  This  distinction  is  particularly  important  for\nnatural resources and is a contentious issue, especially in relation to\nthe  overexploitation  of  natural  resources.\n\nNaturally  occurring  assets  such  as  marine  resources,  minerals,\nand  forests  do  not  enter  the  national  accounts  until  they  are  being\nexploited  and  then  only  to  the  extent  that  they  are  being  exploited.\nUnlike  changes  in  inventories  of  produced  assets,  changes  in  the\nquantum of natural assets are not reflected in the national accounts.\nThis  convention  ignores  the  very  real  impact  that  changes  in  abun-\ndance  of  natural  assets  have  on  the  \u201cwealth\u201d  of  an  economy.  This\ncan result in misleading values being reported on fisheries and other\nsectors that rely on natural resources. For example, the income gen-\nerated  from  the  exploitation  of  fish  is  included  in  the  national\naccounts,  while  the  changes  in  abundance  are  not.  In  these  circum-\nstances, the short-term gain from the overexploitation of a fish stock\nshows up as a positive gain for the economy. If the changes in abun-\ndance  were  also  taken  into  account  as  happens  with  inventories  of\n\u201cproduced assets,\u201d the apparent benefits for the exploitation of natu-\nral  assets  would  be  substantially  reduced.\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n10\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nNational Accounts and Associated Issues\n\n11\n11\n\nFishing  vs.  Fisheries\n\nFor the purpose of clarity, it is useful to distinguish between the\nterms  \u201cFishing\u201d  and  \u201cFisheries.\u201d  \u201cFishing\u201d  is  commonly  used  to\ndescribe  the  various  activities  involved  in  the  harvest  of  aquatic\nresources, whereas \u201cFisheries\u201d is usually used to describe a broader\nrange  from  capture  through  postharvest  handling,  transport,  pro-\ncessing,  and  marketing.\n\nThe  conventions  used  in  the  SNA  and  those  followed  in  this\nreport are somewhat different. The categories of economic activities\nrecognized  by  the  SNA  are  those  of  the  International  Standard\nIndustrial Classification of All Industrial Activities (ISIC). In this sys-\ntem,  the  category  relevant  to  fisheries  is  ISIC  0500:  \u201cFishing,  opera-\ntions of fish hatcheries and fish farms, service activities incidental to\nfishing.\u201d   It is important to note the following:\n\n(i) Postharvest activities, including fish processing, are not included\nin  the  fishing  sector,  but  rather  they  are  generally  counted  in\nmanufacturing  and  other  sectors.\n(ii) Aquaculture  is  included  in  the  sector.\n(iii) Subsistence fishing is a legitimate component of the fishing cat-\n\negory.\n\n(iv) For  convenience,  the  sector  is  usually  referred  to  as  \u201cfishing.\u201d\n\nA useful guide to the classification of an activity as \u201cFishing\u201d is\nprovided  in  the  definitions  of  \u201cfish\u201d  and  \u201cfishing\u201d  as  contained  in\nthe fisheries acts of Pacific Island countries. In each case, the defini-\ntions are very similar. The following extract is taken from the Tonga\nFisheries  Law:\n\n\u201cFish\u201d means any aquatic animal, whether piscine or not, and in-\ncludes any cetacean, mollusk, crustacean, coral (living or dead), and\nother coelenterates, sponge, aquatic plants, holothurian (beche-de-\nmer) or other echinoderm, and turtle, and their young and eggs.\n\n\u201cFishing\u201d means \u2013\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n\nsearching for, catching, taking or harvesting fish;\nattempting to search for, catch, take or harvest fish;\nengaging in any other activity which can reasonably be expected\nto result in the locating, catching, taking or harvesting of fish;\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n11\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f12\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\n(e)\n\n(d) placing, searching for or recovering fish aggregating device or\nassociated electronic equipment including radio beacons;\nany operation at sea directly in support of, or in preparation for\nany activity described in this paragraph; or\nthe use of any other vehicle, air or sea borne, including aircraft\nor helicopter use, in relation to any activity described in this\nparagraph except for emergencies involving the health or safety\nof crew members or the safety of the vessel.\n\n(f)\n\nSport  Fishing/Whale  Watching/Diving\n\nAs  in  any  system  that  divides  a  continuous  range  of  activities\ninto  discrete  categories,  the  construction  of  national  accounts  re-\nquires  some  fairly  arbitrary  dividing  line  to  be  drawn  between  cat-\negories. For example, the activities (or part thereof) of sport fishing,\nwhale watching, and sport diving involve the use and enjoyment of\naquatic  resources.  The  SNA  provides  little  direct  guidance  on  how\nthese activities should be classified. Since in most cases these activi-\nties are forms of entertainment or tourism, the value-added by each\nactivity is generally attributed to other categories in the national ac-\ncounts.\n\nOther  Considerations\n\nWhile  it  is  well  beyond  the  scope  of  this  report  to  provide  a\ncomprehensive analysis of national accounting, there are a few issues\nthat bear directly on fishing and therefore warrant some discussion.\nThese  include  (i)  how  to  measure  an  activity,  (ii)  how  to  calculate\nthe value-added by an activity, (iii) the nature of the organization to\nbe treated as an economic entity, (iv) what was the period in which\nthe  activity  occurred,  (v)  was  the  activity  domestic  or  foreign,  and\n(vi)  whether  the  activity  was  commercial  or  for  subsistence.\n\nSince the level of information available is usually less than per-\nfect  and  occasionally  nonexistent,  the  compilation  of  national  ac-\ncounts  usually  involves  a  number  of  assumptions,  judgments,  and\nestimates. In some circumstances, these assumptions and judgments\nmay  be  incorrect.\n\nIt  must  be  kept  in  mind  that  GDP  is  an  estimate  of  economic\nactivity; it is seldom a precise calculation. Even though the SNA sets\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n12\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nNational Accounts and Associated Issues\n\n13\n13\n\nout  fairly  straightforward  procedures,  in  practice,  the  analyst  is\nusually confronted with many uncertainties. Data are often unavail-\nable,  incomplete  or  suspect;  hence,  the  analyst  is  forced  to  make\njudgments  about  what  data  to  use  and  how  those  data  should  be\ntreated.  Some  people  may  find  this  apparent  lack  of  rigor  disturb-\ning, but it is usually unavoidable, especially in \u201cmessy\u201d sectors like\nfishing.  To  make  matters  worse,  the  fishing  sector  is  often  only  a\nsmall  part  of  GDP,  which  means  that  only  a  limited  amount  of  the\nanalyst\u2019s  time  and  effort  can  be  expended  for  collecting  data  to\nupdate  the  estimate.\n\nTypically,  the  sources  of  data  an  analyst  would  use  to  estimate\nthe contribution of fishing include income and expenditure data from\ncommercial  operations,  fisheries  production  and  marketing  infor-\nmation,  and  household  income  and  expenditure  data.  Sometimes,\nsecondary  data  like  social  security  records,  air-cargo  records,  inter-\nnational market reports, and various reports that bear on aspects of\nthe industry might be used. The choice of which data set to use de-\npends  upon  the  analyst\u2019s  judgment  about  the  accuracy  of  the  data,\nits  coverage,  and  the  ease  of  accessing  the  information.\n\nMultiplier  Effects\n\nGDP  and  its  component  parts  provide  an  important  and  very\nuseful  guide  to  the  structure  of  an  economy,  but  they  do  not  show\nthe impact of any activity on the economy. For example, the fishing\ncontribution to GDP is limited to the value-added to the economy by\nthe activity of fishing, but the flow effects from the activity of fishing\nappear  as  value-added  by  other  sectors  of  the  economy.  The  differ-\nence  between  \u201ccontribution\u201d  and  \u201cimpact\u201d  can  be  illustrated  by\nconsidering the consequences of an increase in fishing activity. If the\namount of fishing activity increases by $1.0 million and the interme-\ndiate  costs  used  in  this  activity  are  $0.4  million,  then  GDP  will  in-\ncrease  by  $0.6  million. At  the  same  time,  the  $0.4  million  spent  on\nthe intermediate costs will directly increase the level of activity else-\nwhere in the economy. If $0.1 million of the $0.4 million were spent\non  provisions,  the  contribution  by  the  \u201cWholesale  and  Retail\u201d  sec-\ntors  to  GDP  would  increase  by  $0.1  million  less  any  intermediate\ncosts.  In  addition,  the  $0.6  million  that  has  now  been  added  to  the\nfishing contribution to GDP is principally wages and profits, most of\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n13\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f14\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\nwhich will be spent by the recipients on goods and services. This, in\nturn, will increase the level of activity in other sectors of the economy.\nThe people who benefit from the sale of goods and services from\n\u201cFishing\u201d will in turn purchase goods and services from others, and\nthereby  stimulate  further  activity.  The  cycle  of  activity  thus  gener-\nated by the initial production will have ripple effects throughout the\neconomy. The aggregate impact will depend upon the extent to which\nthe  goods  and  services  purchased  are  produced  domestically  and\nthe  proportion  of  their  income  that  people  spend  or  save.  The  net\neffect  on  economic  activity  will  almost  certainly  be  far  greater  than\nthe contribution to GDP. This cycle of impact is known as the multi-\nplier  effect.\n\nIn practice, the multiplier effects can be fairly difficult to calcu-\nlate. The dynamic nature of economies means that every action will\nbe followed by a reaction. Changes in a sector will be at least partly\noffset  by  changes  in  the  structure  of  the  economy.  This  was  illus-\ntrated by the response of households in Samoa to the impact of taro\nblight on their primary subsistence crop. Most households responded\nby switching their food production efforts to alternative crops, nota-\nbly  plantains.  So  while  the  level  of  economic  activity  committed  to\ntaro production contracted, in terms of the overall level of economic\nactivity  in  the  economy,  this  contraction  was  largely  offset  by  the\nincrease in the level of activity in plantain production. The net effect\nwas a reduction in economic activity but by a far lesser amount than\nthe  reduction  in  taro  production  activity.\n\nWhile it was beyond the scope of this study to identify the mul-\ntiplier  effects  of  fishing,  it  remains  an  important  issue.  In  the  ab-\nsence  of  this  understanding,  the  impact  of  policy  changes,  manage-\nment  strategies  and  investment  can  be  seriously  underestimated.\n\nValuing  Subsistence  Production\n\nThere  are  several  methods  that  could  be  used  to  value  subsis-\ntence  production  including  (i)  the  \u201cfarm  gate\u201d  pricing  (used  in  this\nreport),  (ii)  the  \u201cvalue  of  calories\u201d  produced,  (iii)  the  \u201copportunity\ncost  of  labor,\u201d  or  (iv)  the  \u201creservation  price  of  labor.\u201d\n\nThe  \u201cfarm  gate\u201d  pricing  method  uses  the  market  price  of  the\nproduct less the cost of getting that product to market. In effect, it is\nsaying that the value of own consumption is equivalent to the price\nthe  product  could  be  sold  for  in  the  market  less  the  cost  of  getting\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n14\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nNational Accounts and Associated Issues\n\n15\n15\n\nthe  product  to  market.  This  approach  implies  that  the  volume  of\nsubsistence  production  would  have  little  or  no  effect  on  the  market\nprice  if  it  were  to  be  marketed.  Where  the  volume  of  subsistence\nfar  outweighs  the  volume  marketed,  this  assumption  may  be  too\ngenerous.\n\nThe  \u201cvalue  of  calories\u201d  approach  estimates  the  calorific  value\nof  home  consumption  and  the  cost  of  purchasing  those  calories  in\nalternative foods. The value of home consumption then becomes the\nvolume of calories consumed multiplied by the cost per calorie. This\napproach  does  not  adequately  account  for  the  nonfood  items  for\nown consumption. It also implies that the \u201cquality\u201d of own produc-\ntion is the same as the \u201cquality\u201d of purchased foods. This may not be\nthe case, especially where a household is willing to pay a premium\nfor purchased goods that are seen as prestige food items. If the value\nof production for own consumption is imputed from premium goods,\nit will be over-valued.\n\nThe  \u201copportunity  cost  of  labor\u201d  approach  requires  data  on  the\namount  of  time  spent  producing  the  product  for  own  consumption\nand  the  income  that  could  be  earned  if  the  labor  was  used  in  an-\nother  way.  There  may,  however,  be  instances  when  alternative  uses\nof labor are few, if not lacking. In such case, the \u201copportunity cost of\nlabor\u201d would be zero; hence, the implied value of own production is\nalso zero. This is obviously not a true representation of the value of\nproduction  for  own  consumption.\n\nThe  \u201creservation  price  of  labor\u201d  is  a  variation  of  the  \u201copportu-\nnity  cost  of  labor.\u201d  It  also  requires  information  on  the  time  spent\nproducing  the  product  for  own  consumption.  But  instead  of  using\nthe  income  that  could  be  earned  if  the  labor  was  used  in  another\nway,  the  \u201creservation  price  of  labor\u201d  uses  the  minimum  return  that\nis  necessary  to  make  a  person  work.  In  effect,  it  is  the  minimum\nacceptable  wage  rate,  which,  it  should  be  noted,  may  be  consider-\nably less than any statutory minimum wage rate. This method would\nprobably  give  the  best  estimate  of  the  value  of  subsistence  produc-\ntion. But since the data necessary to make the calculation is seldom,\nif ever, available, it is rarely used.\n\nWhile each of the above methods has its advantages and disad-\nvantages,  there  are  practical  issues  that  determine  which  method  is\nbest  used.  In  this  report,  the  consultants  have  used  the  \u201cfarm  gate\u201d\npricing method as recommended by SPC in the publication, A Guide\nto  Estimating  the  Value  of  Household  Non-Market  Production  in  the  Pa-\ncific  Island  Developing  Countries  (Bain  1996).\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n15\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\n\n17\n\nGuidelines  for\nCalculating  the  Fishing\nComponent of GDP\n\nGeneral\n\nAs  with  the  estimation  of  any  contribution  to  GDP,  the  most\nappropriate  method  to  use  in  estimating  the  contribution  of  fishing\nwill depend on the nature of the data and the resources available to\ncollect  and  analyze  these  data.\n\nThe compilers of national accounts must strike a balance in their\ndesire  for  accuracy  and  the  limitations  on  the  time  and  effort  they\ncan dedicate to collecting and analyzing data. In the case of fishing,\nstriking  this  balance  means  that  they  are  usually  limited  to  using\ngeneralized  estimates  of  income  or  production.  In  the  consultant\u2019s\nopinion, the minimum level of aggregation that should be used would\ndivide fishing into three classes of activity: (i) large-scale commercial\nfishing,  (ii)  small-scale  commercial  fishing,  and  (iii)  subsistence\nfishing.\n\nIn the following, large-scale commercial fishing is predominantly\nthe offshore tuna fisheries of the region. Small-scale commercial fish-\ning  includes  both  non-tuna  exports  and  the  fishing  to  supply  the\nlocal  markets.  Subsistence  fishing  includes  fishing  for  a  variety  of\nproducts  for  own  consumption.  In  practice,  the  distinction  between\nsmall-scale  commercial  fishing  to  supply  the  local  market  and  sub-\nsistence  fishing  is  somewhat  arbitrary.  The  working  definition  used\nis  that  small-scale  commercial  fishing  includes  all  activities  that  are\npredominantly  for  the  purpose  of  producing  fish  for  sale,  whereas\nsubsistence  fishing  activities  are  those  that  are  predominantly  done\nto  produce  products  for  own  consumption.\n\nLarge-scale Commercial Fishing. This activity usually involves\nrelatively few large vessels operated by commercial enterprises. Nor-\nmally,  these  companies  keep  financial  records  so  it  should  be  pos-\nsible  to  undertake  an  annual  income/expenditure  survey  or,  failing\nthat,  obtain  information  from  taxation  returns.  If  financial  informa-\ntion  is  available  and  reliable,  the  income  approach  can  be  used  to\nestimate  the  contribution  of  large-scale  fishing  to  GDP.  It  is  noted\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n17\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f18\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\nthat  the  structure  and  composition  of  these  financial  records  are\nlikely  to  vary  between  enterprises.  In  the  circumstances,  if  the  in-\ncome  approach  is  to  be  used,  the  compilers  of  national  accounts\nshould seek advice from people involved in the industry on how to\ninterpret  the  data.\n\nWhere  financial  data  are  not  available  or  are  considered  to  be\nunreliable, a production approach could be used. If so, it is essential\nto  identify  a  reliable  source  of  production  records.  This  may  not  be\nas  straightforward  as  it  sounds.  The  ideal  situation  is  where  an\nongoing  series  is  compiled  from  accurate  data  by  an  independent\nagency  using  a  consistent  method  and  published  in  a  timely  man-\nner. In practice, this is a rare situation. In this report, the consultants\nhave usually relied on data from fisheries literature. While this data\npartially  satisfies  the  independence  and  accuracy  criteria,  often\nmethods  used  to  compile  the  data  reported  in  the  literature  vary\nand the data are seldom from an ongoing series.\n\nAlthough  the  production  approach  may  be  the  most  practical\nmethod to use in estimating the contribution of large-scale fishing to\nGDP,  the  compilers  of  national  accounts  should,  in  many  cases,  be\naware  of,  and  compensate  for,  some  important  weaknesses  in  the\nsaid  approach:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nThe  assumption  of  fixed  value-added  ratios.   In  practice,  these  ra-\ntios  are  subject  to  substantial  variation,  more  so  than  in  any\nindustrial  sectors.  Major  causes  of  this  are  changes  in  catch\nrates  and  in  prices.\nThe difficulty of estimating prices.     Typically, prices for fish vary\nwidely by fish size, species, product form, season, and market\nso that average price estimates derived from price data, as op-\nposed  to  revenue  data,  can  be  substantially  inaccurate. \n\nThese  difficulties  with  the  production  approach  can  be  at  least\npartially compensated for by periodic surveys to \u201cground truth\u201d the\nassumptions  on  value-added  ratios  and  prices.\n\nIt is common to use official export figures to estimate the product-\nion of large-scale commercial fishing. Unfortunately, as explained in\nSection  7.2,  the  official  export  figures  are  often  inaccurate. An  alter-\nnative could be to use the production estimates available in various\nforms  from  SPC.  Price  data  can  be  obtained  from  the  FFA  Market\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n18\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nGuidelines for Calculating the Fishing Component of GDP\n\n19\n19\n\nAdvisor. It may also be possible to use an annual informal survey of\nseveral operators but care would be needed to ensure that the infor-\nmation is accurate and unbiased. Given the vagaries of the markets\nfor fish, the operating surplus will vary between years. This, in turn,\nwill  affect  the  size  of  the  value-added  ratio.  As  with  the  price,  it\nshould be possible to estimate the appropriate value-added ratio from\nan  informal  survey  of  several  operators.\n\nSmall-scale Commercial Fishing. This activity usually involves\na  large  number  of  participants  using  a  variety  of  gears  and  fishing\ntechniques.  Often  the  participants  do  not  keep  accurate  financial\nrecords and, even when they do, the time and cost of accessing those\nrecords  each  year  would  be  beyond  the  resources  of  most  statistics\nagencies.  In  these  circumstances,  the  production  approach  is  usu-\nally  the  most  appropriate  method  to  estimate  the  contribution  of\nsmall-scale  commercial  fishing  to  GDP.\n\nThe  difficulty  facing  the  statisticians  is  finding  reliable  produc-\ntion  and  price  data  for  each  year.  The  production  of  small-scale\ncommercial  fishing  can  be  broadly  divided  into  two  classes:  (i)\nexport  products  such  as  trochus,  beche-de-mer,  aquarium  fish,  etc.,\nand (ii) food for sale on the local market.\n\nThe production and value of the export products can vary mark-\nedly  between  years  as  the  supply  and  markets  fluctuate.  In  the  cir-\ncumstances,  the  compilers  of  national  accounts  have  little  choice\nbut to obtain new data each year. In some cases, these data are avail-\nable  from  the  local  fisheries  agency.  Where  the  fisheries  agency  is\nunable  to  provide  the  data,  the  analysts  will  need  to  collect  them\nfrom  the  exporters  or  from  shipping  agents.\n\nIn  the  absence  of  up-to-date  fishery  surveys,  it  should  be  pos-\nsible to extrapolate the value of fish produced for domestic consump-\ntion  from  data  obtained  in  household  income  and  expenditure  sur-\nveys  (HIES),  agricultural  censuses,  and  other  such  sources.  This,\nhowever,  relies  on  the  presumption  that  the  HIES  and  other  such\nsurveys collect data on fish consumption and/or production, some-\nthing that is not always the case. Where the data include per capita\nor household consumption estimates, it is possible to extrapolate the\ndata  using  changes  in  the  population  and  thereby  impute  the  pro-\nduction. It is likely that prices will remain fairly constant, at least in\nreal  terms,  so  occasional  market  surveys  or  data  in  HIES  can  be  in-\ndexed  to  the  consumer  prices  to  estimate  the  value  of  production.\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n19\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f20\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\nSimilarly, the value-added ratios are unlikely to change substantially\nover  time  so  the  data  from  occasional  surveys  on  the  economics  of\nsmall-scale fishing could be used to derive these ratios.\n\nSubsistence Fishing. Most rural households in the region do at\nleast some subsistence fishing. The techniques used, the time spent,\nand the contribution the catch makes to the livelihood of the people\nvary  considerably.\n\nThere are several techniques that can be used to impute subsis-\ntence production, but most rely on some measure of household con-\nsumption of food and/or fish. The most common approach is to use\ndata on consumption, expenditure and/or activity from an HIES as\na base, then compute annual production by using changes in popu-\nlation  to  extrapolate  the  base  data.\n\nOne of the risks pointed out earlier in this report is the possibil-\nity  of  double-counting  subsistence  fishing  and  small-scale  commer-\ncial  fishing.  Care  must  be  taken  to  ensure  that  the  value  of  fishery\nproducts purchased by households from the small-scale commercial\nfishers  are  deducted  from  the  total  consumption  when  estimating\nthe  level  of  subsistence  production.\n\nValue-added  Ratios\n\nThe production approach to estimating the contribution to GDP\nrequires  two  basic  sets  of  data:  (i)  value  of  gross  output  of  fishing,\nand  (ii)  intermediate  costs.\n\nIt is usually convenient to express the intermediate costs as a pro-\nportion  of  the  gross  output.  For  example,  in  the  case  of  small-scale\nfishing using motorized boats, the fuel, bait, provisions, and mainte-\nnance are all intermediate costs. If the total value of the catch is $1,000\nand the sum of the intermediate costs is $400, then the proportion of\nthe gross output attributable to intermediate costs is 40%. Therefore,\nthe value-added by small-scale fishing using motorized boats is $1,000\n* (1\u20130.40) = $600. In this example, the intermediate cost ratio is 0.40\nand  its  reciprocal,  0.60,  is  the  value-added  ratio.  It  should  be  noted\nthat the intermediate costs refer to operating expenses. Expenditures\non large capital items, such as engines, are capital expenditures and\nare  thus  not  counted  as  intermediate  costs.\n\nIn  practice,  each  operator  is  likely  to  have  a  different  value-\nadded  ratio.  However,  in  the  preparation  of  national  accounts,  it  is\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n20\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nGuidelines for Calculating the Fishing Component of GDP\n\n21\n21\n\nusually  not  possible  to  individually  measure  each  operation.  The\nnormal  practice  is  to  estimate  an  average  value-added  ratio  for  each\ntype  of  activity  for  each  country.  In  this  report,  value-added  ratios\nhave  been  estimated  for  each  of  the  main  categories  of  fishing  that\nare used in the region: (i) large-scale offshore fishing, (ii) small-scale\ncommercial  fishing,  and  (iii)  subsistence  fishing.  In  addition,  there\nare various types of specialty fishing\u2014including aquarium fish and\nrelated  products,  diving,  seaweed  culture  and  collection,  and  pearl\ncultivation\u2014each  of  which  has  its  own  value-added  ratio.\n\nCalculating  Value-added  Ratios\n\nLarge-scale Offshore Fishing. All the enterprises involved in this\nsector  are  of  large-sale  commercial  operations.  Of  necessity,  these\nenterprises keep records of their income and expenditure from which\nit is possible to calculate a value-added ratio. It should be noted that\nif  income  and  expenditure  data  are  available  for  every  enterprise\nin  the  sector,  an  income  approach  to  calculating  the  value-added\nratio  would  normally  be  used.  However,  when  this  is  not  the  case,\nanalysts must resort to using a production approach based on over-\nall  production  from  large-scale  fishing  and  price  data.  In  these  cir-\ncumstances,  a  sample  of  the  income  expenditure  of  one  or  more\ntypical enterprises can be used to calculate the value-added ratio for\nthe  sector.\n\nSmall-scale  Commercial  Fishing.  This  sector  is  usually  more\ndiverse  than  large-scale  commercial  operations.  There  is  often  a\nmarked difference in the type of vessel used by each enterprise. Typi-\ncally, the vessel used could be specially designed fishing boats with\ninboard  motors,  outboard  skiffs,  and  canoes.  The  cost  of  operating\neach  type  of  vessel  differs  and,  hence,  the  value-added  ratio  of  the\nrelated activity also differs. Some enterprises may keep income and\nexpenditure  records,  but  many  do  not.  Also,  it  is  often  difficult  to\nsplit  the  sector  catch  between  each  class  of  activity.  In  the  circum-\nstances, the analyst usually must resort to using a generalized estimate\nof  value-added  ratios  based  upon  information  about  the  composi-\ntion of the fleet. Information from which to estimate the value-added\nratios for small-scale fishing may be available from (i) the records of\ndevelopment  banks  and  other  financial  institutions,  (ii)  surveying\nthe sector, (iii) published reports on the sector including studies into\nthe benefit/cost of proposed development projects, and (iv) anecdotal\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n21\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f22\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\ninformation  from  discussions  with  people  involved  in  the  sector.\n\nSubsistence Fishing. The subsistence sector is also quite diverse.\nSubsistence  fishing  can  include  gleaning,  canoe  fishing,  gill  netting,\ncast nets, fish drives, fish traps, torch fishing, and trolling from motor-\nized skiffs. While the value-added ratio for each activity is different,\nin general, it should be possible to categorize subsistence fishing into\ntwo sets of activities: (i) those that involve motorized boats, and (ii)\nthose  that  do  not.  The  nonmotorized  fishing  activities  have  a  very\nlow  level  of  intermediate  cost  and,  therefore,  a  high  value-added\nratio.  It  would  be  rare  for  the  value-added  ratio  of  the  non-motor-\nized activities to be less than 90%. In contrast, the motorized subsis-\ntence fishing activities range from high-cost trolling to medium- and\nlow-cost  bottom  fishing.  Estimating  the  value-added  ratio  of  the\nnonmotorized  activities  is  likely  to  prove  most  difficult;  but,  given\nthe  high  percentage  of  value-added  in  these  activities,  slight  errors\nin the value-added ratio used for them is unlikely to result in a major\ndifference  in  the  estimated  contribution  to  GDP.  The  value-added\nfrom motorized fishing activities should be very similar to that of the\nsmall-scale commercial fishing. Given the difficulty in separating the\ngross  output  of  each  activity  in  the  subsistence  sector,  a  reasonable\napproach  is  to  estimate  an  average  value-added  ratio  weighted  by\nthe  proportion  of  the  catch  (by  value)  taken  by  nonmotorized  and\nby  motorized  fishing  activities.\n\nSources  of  Value-added  Ratios\n\nIn  this  report,  the  consultants  have  relied  upon  (i)  published\nestimates  of  value-added  ratios,  (ii)  the  ratios  used  in  calculating\nnational  accounts  in  various  countries,  (iii)  reported  income  and\nexpenditure  data  for  some  activities,  (iv)  discussions  with  people\ninvolved  in  the  industry,  and  (v)  their  own  knowledge  and  experi-\nence.

Methods\nused in the official calculation of the fishing contribution to GDP are\nalso  presented,  and  some  comments  are  made  on  the  suitability  of\nthose  methods.\n\nThe  official  data  on  GDP  and  fishing  contribution  are  summa-\n\nrized  in  Table  4.\n\nRationale  for  Re-estimating  the  Fishing  Contribution  to  GDP\n\nThe  fishing  sector  is  complex.  It  includes  thousands  of  produc-\ners  operating  in  many  locations  and  using  a  wide  variety  of  tech-\nniques.  Crew  are  often  paid  in  kind  or  receive  a  share  of  the  catch\nrather than wages; and even when they do receive wages, collecting\ninformation on those wages can be difficult. In comparison to other\nsectors  of  Pacific  Island  economies  such  as  government,  manufac-\nturing,  or  tourism,  calculating  the  contribution  of  fishing  to  an\neconomy  is  a  particularly  difficult  task.\n\nIn most Pacific Island countries, there is surprisingly little coop-\neration  between  the  fisheries  agencies  and  the  statisticians  respon-\nsible for compiling the national accounts. Given that the calculation\nof  fishing  contribution  to  an  economy  requires  considerable  insight\ninto  the  technical  aspects  of  fishing,  this  lack  of  cooperation  is  dis-\nconcerting.  Although  fisheries  agencies  appear  eager  to  have  the\nimportance  of  fishing  to  an  economy  properly  reported,  most  seem\nto  be  ineffective  in  ensuring  that  this  happens.\n\nWhile  the  fishing  sector  is  undoubtedly  very  important  in  all\nPacific  Island  countries,  in  most,  it  accounts  for  a  relatively  modest\nshare  of  GDP.  Given  this  situation,  it  is  unreasonable  to  expect  the\ncompilers of national accounts to dedicate a large proportion of their\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n27\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f28\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\ntime  to  measuring  the  contribution  of  fishing  to  the  economy.  This\nconstraint,  when  combined  with  the  complexity  of  the  sector  and\nthe lack of cooperation with the fisheries agencies, results in a situation\nwhere  the  estimated  contribution  of  fishing  to  GDP  is  often\ninaccurate.\n\nGiven the complexity of the issues to be addressed and the large\ndifference in the accuracy of the estimates made in the Pacific Island\ncountries,  the  consultants  considered  it  essential  to  re-estimate  the\nfishing contribution to GDP for each country. It was believed that, at\nthe  very  least,  the  re-estimates  would  provide  useful  comparators\nfor the compilers of national accounts. In addition, it was anticipated\nthat  the  review  of  the  different  methods  and  approaches  used  in\neach country would provide useful insights into the effectiveness of\nalternative approaches to calculating the fishing contribution to GDP.\n\nRe-estimates  of  the  Fishing  Contribution  to  GDP\n\nThe methods used in calculating the fishing contribution to GDP\nof  the  various  countries  were  analyzed  by  the  consultants.  Com-\nments on the suitability of these methods are given in Appendix 1.\nIn some of the countries, the methods used to calculate the fish-\ning component of GDP were well documented. In others, this infor-\nmation  was  obtained  verbally.  It  is  likely  that  at  least  some  of  this\nverbal  information  were  inaccurate  for  various  reasons,  including\nthe provider being unfamiliar with the subject. This should be taken\ninto  account  when  considering  the  comments  on  any  weakness  in\nthe  methodology  used  in  a  particular  country.\n\nThe consultants re-estimated the fishing contribution to GDP in\neach  of  the  countries.  The  methods  used  and  the  new  estimates  are\ngiven  in Appendix  1.  The  official  figures  and  re-estimates  are  sum-\nmarized  in  Table  5.\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n28\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nCurrent Contributions of Fishing to GDP in

Contribution\nto GDP\n\nIn  scrutinizing  the  methods  used  in  the  various  Pacific  Island\ncountries  to  calculate  the  fishing  contribution  to  GDP,  certain  fea-\ntures and common difficulties emerged. A discussion of some of these\nissues may help improve future estimates.\n\nIn several of the Pacific Island countries, the individuals respon-\nsible for calculating the fishing contribution to GDP (sometimes these\nindividuals  are  responsible  for  all  the  other  sectors)  appear  to  be\nunfamiliar  with  the  technical  basis  of  the  methods  they  used  for\ndetermining the fishing contribution. According to discussions with\nseveral such individuals, methods presently being used were devel-\noped  by  a  colleague  who  has  since  departed. A  \u201crecipe\u201d  is  now  be-\ning  followed,  but  the  rationale  for  many  components  is  apparently\nnot understood by these individuals to the degree by which they are\nable  to  explain  the  methodology  used.\n\nSubsistence fisheries form a large component of the fishing sec-\ntor in most Pacific Island countries. There are problems dealing with\nthe treatment of subsistence fisheries in GDP calculations in several\ncountries,  and  these  often  result  in  underestimating  the  importance\nof  the  entire  fishing  sector.  In  some  countries,  because  the  statistics\nagencies  lack  data  on  subsistence  fisheries,  the  contribution  to  GDP\nis  not  calculated  and  effectively  become  recorded  as  zero.  In  other\ncountries,  because  of  the  manner  in  which  subsistence  information\nis collected for GDP purposes, it is not possible to isolate fishing from\nthe  other  subsistence  activities.  In  which  case,  the  reported  \u201cfish-\ning\u201d sector is actually \u201cfishing other than subsistence fishing.\u201d  The\neffect  on  the  GDP  contribution  can  be  substantial  in,  for  example,\nFiji Islands where subsistence fisheries are responsible for over 50%\nof  the  domestic  fisheries  production.\n\nAlthough in the SNA scheme the processing of fish (packaging,\nloining, canning) is outside the \u201cfishing\u201d sector, it may often be use-\nful to know the GDP contribution of this fisheries-related activity. In\nmost  countries  where  substantial  fish  processing  occurs,  it  was  not\npossible for the consultants to identify its GDP contribution because\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n31\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f32\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\nthis  information  was  lumped  under  the  general  category  on  \u201cfood\nprocessing.\u201d    On  further  reflection  over  the  desirability  of  isolating\nfish  processing  in  the  national  accounts,  there  appears  to  be  two\nvery different types of fish processing: (i) processing that is intimately\nrelated  to  the  fishing  and  fish  resources  of  the  country  concerned\n(for  example,  the  tuna  cannery  in  Madang),  and  (ii)  processing  that\nis  unrelated  to  the  fishing  and  fish  resources  of  the  country  con-\ncerned  but  rather  processing  of  imported  bulk  food  (for  example,\nthe  mackerel  cannery  in  the  Fiji  Islands  which  uses  raw  product\nfrom  the  United  States  [US]).\n\nIn the future, it is likely that an increasing share of the benefits\nfrom \u201cfisheries\u201d will come from fish processing. This being the case,\nthere is a strong argument for the national accounts to disaggregate\nwithin  the  food  processing  sector  the  specific  contribution  of  fish\nprocessing.  The  Fiji  Islands  has  recognized  this  advantage  and,  in\nthe  future  national  accounts,  the  value  added  from  fish  canneries\nwill  be  shown  separately.\n\nA  common  problem  encountered  by  the  consultants  was  the\ndiscrepancy  between  the  official  figures  and  other  probably  more\nreliable  sources  of  information  for  a  crucial  input  into  the  GDP  cal-\nculations. This frequently occurs when export information is used to\nvalue  the  gross  output  of  a  subsector  of  the  fishing  sector.  Official\nexport  figures  in  the  Pacific  Island  countries  characteristically  un-\ndervalue  exported  commodities,  especially  fisheries  products.  Fre-\nquently,  there  is  better  information  available  from  such  sources  as\nthe industry, independent observers, fisheries agencies, and audited\naccounts  of  exporting  companies.  Statistics  departments,  however,\noften  use  the  official  figures  because  (i)  the  data  can  easily  be  ac-\ncessed,  (ii)  they  are  required  by  government  policy  to  use  such  fig-\nures, (iii) these do not require technical insight to make a judgment\ncall,  (iv)  there  is  the  perception  that  these  figures  are  not  biased  by\ncommercial  factors,  or  (v)  of  a  desire  for  consistency.  Despite  these\nreasons,  the  net  result  of  calculating  GDP  using  obviously  inaccu-\nrate  official  information  is  lowered  credibility  for  the  national  ac-\ncounts.\n\nOne  of  the  difficulties  facing  any  analyst  trying  to  determine\nthe value added to GDP by small-scale fishing is the scarcity of infor-\nmation  on  the  economics  of  small-scale  fishing  in  the  Pacific  Island\ncountries. It is noted that in the 1980s the assistance provided to the\nPacific Island countries by the FFA included support for the analysis\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n32\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nSome Observations of Fishing Contribution to GDP\n\n33\n33\n\nof the economics of small-scale fishing. In the early 1990s, when the\nFFA  changed  its  focus  of  operations  to  concentrate  almost  entirely\non  the  tuna  fisheries,  the  organization  virtually  ceased  its  involve-\nment in the analysis of small-scale coastal fisheries. Despite the clear\nneed for further work in the area, the task was not taken up by SPC\nor  any  other  regional  organization.  One  important  consequence  is\nthat  there  is  little  information  available  on  the  economics  of  small-\nscale fisheries. This information would be of considerable assistance\nto  the  compilers  of  national  accounts.\n\nHIES  are  a  valuable  tool  for  obtaining  national  account  infor-\nmation  including  fisheries.  In  addition,  it  was  noted  that  for  some\ncountries, like Tonga and FSM, these surveys are an important source\nof information on national fisheries production. It was noticed, how-\never, that many of the HIES used were quite old. Also, the fisheries\ninformation  produced  from  the  HIES  could  have  been  made  more\nuseful  had  there  been  some  technical  inputs  from  the  government\nfisheries agency into the survey design.\n\nThere appears to be a lack of \u201cchampions\u201d for the fisheries sec-\ntor.  In  many  sectors  of  the  economies  of  Pacific  Island  countries,\nthere are groups or individuals who are vocal at stressing the impor-\ntance  of  their  respective  sector,  supplying  the  government  with  in-\nformation  that  emphasizes  this  importance,  and  correcting  govern-\nment information/statistics which downplay this importance. There\ndo  not  appear  to  be  such  champions  for  fisheries,  as  there  are  in\ntourism,  manufacturing,  and  the  other  sectors.\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n33\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\n\n35\n\nFisheries  Production\nLevels\n\nSummary  Information\n\n  Information  on  the  annual  fisheries  production  in  each  of  the\nPacific Island country is given in Appendix 2.

Passfield  (1997)\ndiscusses  some  of  these  methods.  \u201cFarm  gate\u201d  pricing  is  the\nmethod recommended by SPC in Bain (1996), and is the method\nused in the present study.\n\n(cid:127) Coastal  Commercial  Fisheries.  The  valuation  of  the  produc-\ntion of coastal commercial fisheries is made using the best infor-\nmation  available.  Depending  on  the  country,  this  ranges  from\nrecent studies on fish marketing to a near lack of any documen-\ntation. In the latter case, information was obtained by telephone\nfrom the countries concerned and by using information in Dalzell\net  al.  (1996),  with  adjustments  for  price  changes.\n\n(cid:127) Offshore  Fisheries.  For  the  offshore  fisheries,  the  values  used\nfor locally-based vessels are estimated using free on board (FOB)\nprices. Applying this concept to the foreign-based offshore fish-\neries,  the  values  given  are  the  overseas  market  prices  less  the\ncosts of getting the products to these markets. The Market Advi-\nser  of  FFA  provided  the  average  values  of  the  average  species\nmix for the various Distant Water Fishing Nation (DWFN) gear/\nnationality  combinations.  Transshipment  costs  were  subtracted\nfrom these prices to arrive at an in-country value for the catch.\n\nAs  1999  is  the  most  recent  year  for  which  most  the  Pacific  Is-\nland  countries  have  GDP  information,  efforts  to  estimate  fisheries\nproduction were focused on that year. Given the relative size of the\noffshore  fisheries,  any  atypical  features  of  the  tuna  fisheries  in  1999\nmay affect the average situation that  the estimates were intended to\nportray. Because Hampton et al. (2000) indicate that 1999 was typical\nof  a  La  Ni\u00f1a  situation,  with  the  Southern  Oscillation  Index  remain-\ning  in  the  positive  range  throughout  1999,  it  is  likely  that  the  year\nwas  not  unusual  for  tuna  fishing.\n\nGeneral  Comments\n\nIn  attempting  to  obtain  national  fisheries  information  for  this\nstudy,  it  became  apparent  that  most  countries  in  the  region  have\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n37\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f38\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\nvery limited knowledge of overall national fisheries production. Typi-\ncally,  government  fisheries  agencies  give  low  priority  to  estimating\nthe  total  amount  of  domestic  catches.  In  general,  the  smaller  the\nscale  of  the  fishing,  the  less  is  known  about  the  production  levels,\nwith quantitative information being especially scarce for the subsis-\ntence  fisheries.  Samoa,  where  a  survey  of  village  fisheries  has  re-\ncently  been  completed,  is  a  notable  exception.\n\nWhere  attempts  have  been  made  to  estimate  national  produc-\ntion from small-scale fisheries, the estimates have usually been made\nfrom data gathered from HIES, nutrition, and other surveys outside\nthe  fisheries  sector.  In  the  cases  where  this  information  has  come\nfrom  surveys  focused  on  fisheries,  the  techniques  have  usually  in-\nvolved  dietary  recall  rather  than  methods  such  as  creel  surveys  or\nsampling  at  landing  points.  Considering  this  dependence  on  recall,\nsome  validation  (\u201cground  truthing\u201d)  may  be  in  order.\n\nIn  calculating  national  fisheries  production,  once  a  figure  for\nthe  national  production  of  the  fisheries  sector  (or  subdivision)  has\nbeen established, it is common practice to use that figure for years or\neven  decades  with  little  adjustment  except  for  population  growth.\nThis  can  produce  erroneous  estimates,  especially  when  the  original\nestimates were of poor quality.\n\nSome  notable  patterns  in  the  fisheries  production  data  are:\n\n(i) The weighted average price per kg for the whole region for the\nvarious  categories  are  $1.04  for  the  production  from  subsis-\ntence  fisheries,  $2.41  for  coastal  commercial,  $1.28  for  locally-\nbased  offshore,  and  $1.04  for  foreign-based  offshore.\n\n(ii) The ranking of countries by total fisheries production is strongly\n\ninfluenced  by  the  level  of  tuna  catches.\n\n(iii) There  is  a  general  pattern  of  decreasing  total  national  catches\nif one goes from west to east  across the region, and from equa-\ntorial  to  higher  latitudes.\n\n(iv) The value of longline tuna relative to purse seine tuna is appar-\nent  from  the  ranking  of  FSM  (third  place  in  volume  but  first\nplace  in  value)  due  to  relatively  more  longlining  activities  in\nFSM than in PNG or Kiribati.\n\n(v) The  Fiji  Islands  appears  to  have  the  largest  non-tuna  produc-\n\ntion, in terms of both volume and value.\n\n(vi) The production from Tuvalu and Nauru is almost entirely rela-\n\nted  to  tuna  fishing.\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n38\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nFisheries Production Levels\n\n39\n39\n\nComparisons  with  Previous  Work\n\nThe only previous attempt to estimate and summarize volumes\nand values of national fisheries production in the Pacific Island region\nwas that by Dalzell, Adams, and Polunin (1996) in  \u201cCoastal Fisher-\nies  in  the  Pacific  Islands\u201d  (herein  referred  to  as  the  Dalzell  study).\nThe information contained in the Dalzell study, as well as in numer-\nous  other  studies  of  fisheries  in  the  region,  has  proven  extremely\nuseful  for  the  present  survey.  For  some  countries,  the  Dalzell  study\nremains  the  sole  estimate  of  total  national  coastal  fisheries  catches.\nThe present survey used, among others, the Dalzell study, more\nrecent  surveys,  and  studies  outside  the  fisheries  sector  containing\nrelevant  information.  There  are  some  differences  in  the  results  of\nthe  Dalzell  study  and  the  present  study.  Some  of  these  differences\nreflect  actual  changes  in  fisheries  over  the  past  10  years  (e.g.,  in-\ncreased commercialization of fisheries in FSM). Others arise because\nof  the  availability  of  additional  information  on  which  to  make  the\nestimates  (e.g.,  the  use  of  HIES  information  in  Tonga);  while  others\nreflect  distortions  due  to  changes  in  the  value  of  local  currencies\nrelative  to  the  US  dollar  (e.g.,  the  PNG  kina  devalued  270%  during\nthe  decade).\n\nBearing  the  above  in  mind,  some  observations  can  be  made  on\n\nthe  differences  between  the  present  study  and  that  of  Dalzell\u2019s:\n\n(cid:127)\n\nSubsistence  Production.  The  volume  estimates  made  in  this\nstudy  are  about  25%  higher  than  those  in  the  Dalzell  study.\nThis seems reasonable considering the population of the region\nincreased  by  about  27%  during  the  1990s  (Ryan  and  Stepanoff\n2000).  The  country  which  showed  the  largest  difference  in  vol-\nume  estimates  was  Tonga,  where  the  difference  is  mainly  due\nto  the  use  by  the  present  study  of  information  from  an  HIES.\nDifferences  in  the  value  of  the  subsistence  catch  between  the\ntwo  studies  were  also  significant,  with  the  present  study  using\nvalue estimates which are about 50% less than those used in the\nDalzell  study.  This  difference  in  value  estimates  can  mostly  be\nattributed  to  (i)  the  method  used  to  value  subsistence  catches\n(the  present  study  used  the  \u201cfarm  gate\u201d  scheme for  valuation,\nwhile  the  Dalzell  study  mostly  used  full  market  values),  and\n(ii)  the  changes  in  local  currency  exchange  rates  relative  to  the\nUS  dollar,  especially  in  PNG  and  the  Solomon  Islands.\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n39\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f40\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\n(cid:127) Commercial Coastal Production. In this study, estimates of the\ncatch  volume  are  almost  50%  higher  than  in  the  Dalzell  study.\nFSM  and  Samoa  reported  significant  real  increases  in  volume\nestimates,  while  other  countries  showed  increases  which  are\nmainly due to the availability of better information (e.g., Tonga,\nSolomon  Islands,  and  Tuvalu).  The  value  estimates  in  US  dol-\nlars  of  the  commercial  coastal  production  generally  increased\nby  about  35%.  There  are,  however,  countries  that  showed  a\ndecrease in value estimates. The drop may be due to actual de-\nclines in either activity (Vanuatu) or exchange rates (Fiji Islands).\nThe  major  increase  in  volume/value  reported  for  the  Cook  Is-\nlands  is  due  to  the  inclusion  of  pearl  aquaculture  in  the  esti-\nmates of the present study.\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n40\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\n\n41\n\nSummary  of  Information\non  Employment,  Exports\nand  Imports,  Access  Fees,\nand Fish Consumption\n\nFisheries-related  Employment\n\nInformation  on  employment  in  the  fisheries  sector  is  given  for\n\neach  Pacific  Island  country  in Appendix  2.\n\nIt is difficult to summarize the available information on the con-\ntribution  of  fisheries  to  employment  in  Pacific  Island  countries  for\nseveral  reasons:\n\n(i) The  various  sources  of  information  on  fisheries  employment\n\nrange  from  informal  estimates  to  structured  surveys.\n\n(ii) The  data  originate  from  studies  ranging  from  initiatives  con-\nfined to the fisheries sector to much broader exercises that cov-\nered  all  economic  sectors  or  the  entire  population.\n\n(iii) The various terms used to categorize employment (e.g., subsis-\ntence,  employment,  total  employment,  paid  work,  workforce,\nfisher)  differ  between  studies  and  between  countries.\n\n(iv) The  studies  deal,  in  different  ways,  with  the  various  mixes  of\n\npaid,  unpaid  work,  and  work  for  the  family.\n\n(v) There is inconsistency across countries in the categorization of\nfish processing. In some countries, it is placed in the same sec-\ntor  as  fishing;  while  in  others,  it  is  in  manufacturing.\n\n(vi) Some of the studies have produced obviously erroneous results;\n\nfor others, it is difficult to establish credibility.\n\nBearing  the  above  in  mind,  an  attempt  has  been  made  to\nextract  from Appendix  2  nominal  information  for  each  country  on\nthe  relative  importance  of  fisheries  employment.  This  is  given  in\nTable  8  below.\n\nAs  presented  in  Table  8,  the  available  information  on  fisheries\nemployment  in  Pacific  Island  countries  is  a  heterogeneous  assem-\nblage of facts.

In another survey, a \u201cfisher\u201d is defined as a person who\nparticipated  in  fishing  during  the  2-week  period  prior  to  the\nsurvey. But, in the Solomon Islands, a \u201cfisher\u201d refers to a person\nwhose  main  activity  is  fishing.\nIn  FSM,  \u201cemployed\u201d  includes  \u201cformal  workforce\u201d  and  both\nmarket-oriented  and  subsistence  agriculture/fishing.  However,\nin Palau, \u201cemployed\u201d is defined as \u201cat work at all times during\nthe  reference  week  as  a  paid  employee.\u201d\n\nDespite  its  shortcomings,  some  observations  can  be  made  on\nthe existing information on the importance of fisheries employment:\n\n(i) The importance of fisheries in subsistence seems to have a strong\nrelationship  to  the  type  of  island.  The  level  of  significance  is\nhighest  in  atolls,  followed  by  small  islands,  and  least  in  large\nhigh islands. This pattern is somewhat altered by PNG with its\nimportant  freshwater  subsistence  fisheries.\n\n(ii) The importance of fisheries in formal employment seems to be\nrelated more to business conditions than to island type. These\nconditions  include,  among  others,  proximity  to  processing  fa-\ncilities, schedule of airline connections, and fuel taxation. Most\nformal  employment  in  fisheries  appears  to  be  tuna-related.\n\n(iii) The  accurate  portrayal  of  the  importance  of  women  in  fisher-\nies employment appears to be negatively affected by (i) the con-\ncept  of  using  \u201cmain  unpaid  activity\u201d  for  defining  the  subsis-\ntence  fisheries  sector,  as  it  downplays  the  importance  of  sec-\nondary  activities  (e.g.,  even  for  women  who  do  considerable\nfishing,  childcare  is  often  the  main  unpaid  activity);  and  (ii)\nplacing  commercial  fish  processing  (where  many  women  are\nemployed)  in  the  manufacturing  sector.\n\n(iv) Where commercial fish processing occurs (e.g., canning, loining)\nand where this is attributed to the fisheries sector, the increase\nin size of fisheries employment is remarkable.\n\n(v) Overseas employment in industrial fishing vessels does not ap-\npear to be captured in many of the employment surveys.\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n42\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nSummary of Information on Employment, Exports and Imports...\n\n43\n43\n\nTable  8: The  Relative  Importance  of  Fisheries  in\nPaid  Employment  and  in  Subsistence\n\nCountry\n\nBasic  Information  on  Fisheries-related  Employment\n\nCook\nIslands\n\nFiji Islands\n\nFSM\n\nKiribati\n\nMarshall\nIslands\n\nNauru\n\nNiue\n\nPalau\n\nPNG\n\nSamoa\n\nSolomon\nIslands\n\nTonga\n\nTuvalu\n\nVanuatu\n\nAbout  22.0%  of  the  population,  or  approximately  4,435  people,  were\ninvolved  in  subsistence  fishing.

Of  these,  767  individuals  (7.4%)  were  from  the  fishing\nsector.\n\nOf the 7,848 people who had \u201ccash work,\u201d 349 people (4.4%) had fisheries-\nrelated  jobs\u2014e.g.,  seaweed  grower,  coastal  fisherman,  deepsea  fisher-\nman,  or  other  fisheries  workers.  About  12.0%  of  the  households  in  Kiribati\ndo  not  fish.  Of  those  that  do  fish,  17.0%  fish  commercially  full  time,  22.0%\nfish  commercially  part-time,  and  61.0%  fish  only  for  subsistence.\n\nAn estimated 2.8% of all employment is in fishing.\n\nThere are 100 half-time commercial fishermen, which would be equivalent to\n50 full-time fishermen. The census indicated 1,917 formally-employed people.\n\nAround  61.0%  of  the  households  performed  some  form  of  fishing  activity.\n\nThere  are  200  commercial  fishers  and  1,100  noncommercial  fishers  in  a\npopulation  of  19,000.  These  fishers  represent  about  6.8%  of  the  total\npopulation.\n\nOut  of  130,963  citizen  rural  households,  about  23.0%  are  engaged  in\ncatching  fish.  Of  this,  about  60.0%  caught  fish  for  own  consumption  only,\nand  the  rest  caught  fish  for  both  own  consumption  and  for  selling.\n\nA  total  of  500\u2013600  people  therefore  appear  to  be  formally  employed  in  the\nfishing  sector  in  Samoa.  One  third  of  the  total  number  of  households  in\nSamoa is engaged in some form of fishing.\n\nAbout 6.0% of employment in \u201cpaid work\u201d are in \u201cfishing and related\nactivities.\u201d About 5.0% of the people involved in unpaid work had fishing as\ntheir \u201cmain unpaid activity.\u201d\n\nApproximately  8.0%  of  paid  employment  are  in  the  fisheries  sector;  and\n3.2%  of  economically-active  people  are  in  the  fisheries  sector.\n\nFormal  cash  employment  in  fisheries  represents  around  5.3%  of  all  cash\nemployment.

However,  some  conjecture\non the subject could be made and may even prove useful, if only to\nencourage  refinement  of  the  employment  estimates.\n\nMcCoy  (1991)  estimated  that,  in  the  Pacific  Islands,  there  were\n17,080  motorized  fishing  vessels  and  24,612  nonmotorized  fishing\nvessels.  If  it  is  assumed  that  (i)  75%  of  the  motorized  vessels  and\n10% of the nonmotorized vessels are used in some form of commer-\ncial fishing, and (ii) an average of three crew are carried on a motor-\nized commercial vessel and 1.5 crew are carried on a nonmotorized\ncommercial vessel, then the number of employed in commercial fish-\ning is about 42,000. This figure must, however, be adjusted by (i) the\ncommercial  fishers  who  do  not  use  a  vessel,  and  (ii)  the  1,200  men\nthat  McCoy  and  Gillett  (1997)  estimated  to  be  working  on  the  10\nmajor  foreign  fleets  operating  in  the  region.    Using  this  reasoning,\nabout  45,000  Pacific  Islanders  appear  to  be  presently  involved  in\ncommercial  fishing  in  the  region.\n\nOf  relevance  to  the  present  study  on  the  economic  importance\nof fisheries, few of the surveys which produced information on fish-\neries-related employment were (i) specifically designed with the ob-\njective of determining the relative importance of employment in the\nvarious sectors, and (ii) formulated with sampling strategies appro-\npriate  for  the  fisheries  sector.\n\nThe Fiji Islands\u2019 1998 Employment Survey provides an example\nof a survey using a sampling strategy suitable to the fisheries sector.\nIntuitively, the amount of fishing employment suggested by the sur-\nvey seems low\u2014340 people with paid employment.  In another study,\nit  has  been  estimated  (Gillett  et  al.  2001)  that  the  Fiji  domestic\nlongliners  alone  employ  340  people  as  crew.  Discussions  with  the\nFiji Bureau of Statistics officials revealed that the following may have\ncontributed  to  their  low  estimate:\n\n(i) The survey used the postal enquiry system in which question-\nnaires were mailed out. Large firms (e.g., gold mining, garment\nmanufacturing)  are  more  likely  than  small  fishing  enterprises\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n44\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nSummary of Information on Employment, Exports and Imports...\n\n45\n45\n\nto  return  the  forms,  or  subsequently  respond  to  government\npressure  to  return  the  forms.\n\n(ii) The framework of the survey is based on the business register,\nand the smaller the firm, the less likely it is to be on the register.\n(iii) The  survey  and  the  follow-up  for  nonresponse  were  focused\non the islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, whereas there are\nmany fishing enterprises located outside of the Fiji Islands\u2019 two\nmain  islands.\n\nOther  information  on  fisheries  employment  in  the  Fiji  Islands\nsuggests that the 1998 survey underestimated fisheries employment\nby  more  than  an  order  of  magnitude.  One  lesson  learned  from  this\nexample  and  from  other  employment  surveys  encountered  during\nthe present study is that, due to the complexity of the fisheries sec-\ntor,  it  is  relatively  difficult  to  examine.  Simple  sampling  strategies,\nwhich may be suitable for other sectors, may not be appropriate for\nestimating  employment  in  the  fisheries  sector.\n\nTo  accurately  gauge  the  relative  importance  of  fisheries  in\nnational  paid  employment,  it  is  necessary  to  have  a  survey  that\ncovers  all  sectors  of  the  economy,  rather  than  just  have  a  fisheries-\nspecific study. The sampling strategy for such a national level study\n(e.g., national census, HIES, labor survey) must not be biased against\nparticular  sectors,  which  in  the  case  of  fisheries  would  require  at\nleast  some  dialogue  between  the  designers  of  the  survey  and  those\nwith  technical  expertise  in  fisheries.\n\nTo accurately gauge the relative importance of fisheries in subsist-\nence activity, the concept of enumerating subsistence fishers appears\ninappropriate.  It  would  be  more  realistic  to  partition  subsistence\nactivity into its various sector components. This activity analysis, as\nwith the paid employment survey above, would need to be done at\na level higher than the fisheries sector to accurately portray the rela-\ntive importance of the various subsistence activities, including fishing.\n\nExports  and  Imports  of  Fishery  Products\n\nSummary of Nominal Information\n\nTable 9 lists the nominal values of fishery product exports.

The nominal FOB value\nof exports of aquarium fish for the year 1999 are Cook Islands\nUS$73,500;  Fiji  Islands  US$178,000;  Kiribati  US$1,160,000;\nMarshall  Islands  US$473,000;  and  Vanuatu  US$16,500.\nAquarium  fish  exports  from  Kiribati  and  the  Marshall  Islands\nnow  account  for  78%  and  95%,  respectively,  of  all  fisheries\nexports  from  those  countries.\n\n(v) There is considerable inter-annual variation in fisheries exports.\n(vi) The  amount  of  fishery  products  exported  as  passenger  bag-\ngage  in  many  countries  is  quite  large,  especially  from  FSM,\nMarshall  Islands,  Palau,  and  Samoa.\n\nComments on the Accuracy of the Fisheries Export and Import Data\n\nThe  most  notable  feature  of  fishery  trade  data  in  the  Pacific\nIsland  countries  is  the  underestimation  of  the  value  of  fisheries\nexports.  This  underestimation  appears  large  and  relatively  worse\nthan  in  other  trade  sectors.  In  most  cases,  when  the  official  export\nvalues  are  compared  to  other  sources  of  similar  information  (e.g.,\nimporting  country  information,  Convention  on  the  International\nTrade  of  Endangered  Species  [CITES]  records,  audited  exporting\ncompany  accounts),  the  differences  are  remarkable.  There  are\nseveral  possible  reasons  for  the  differences:\n\n(i) Most  government  customs  departments  are  oriented  to  taxing\n\nimports  and  may  give  low  priority  to  documenting  exports.\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n48\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nSummary of Information on Employment, Exports and Imports...\n\n49\n49\n\n(ii) Keeping track of fisheries exports, as compared to other major\ncommodities exported by Pacific Island countries, is more com-\nplex due to:\n\n(a) presence  of  many  exporters;\n(b) a  multitude  of  different  products  each  with  different\n\nvalues;\nlarge  numbers  of  small  shipments;  and\n\n(c)\n(d) many  different  export  points.\n\n(iii) Often  there  is  no  examination  by  customs  departments  of  the\n\nexported  commodities.\n\n(iv) Because  much  of  the  exported  fish  is  sold  through  auctions,\nexporters  typically  do  not  know  the  price  of  the  products  at\nthe  time  of  export.\n\n(v) There  are  numerous  incentives  for  exporters  to  place  a  low\nvalue  on  exports\u2014e.g.,  taxation,  foreign  exchange  controls,\nhiding  income  from  partners.\n\nAnother  problem  in  accurately  quantifying  fisheries  exports  is\nthat,  in  many  countries,  products  that  would  normally  be  consid-\nered  fishery  products  are  not  being  captured  in  the  official  export\nstatistics:\n\n(i) For  some  countries,  fisheries  exports  are  confined  to  finfish.\n(ii) Coral  exports  are  not  considered  to  be  a  fishery  product  in  at\n\nleast  two  countries.\n\n(iii) Some  countries  specifically  list  a  few  important  fisheries\nexports,  and  lump  other  fishery  products  together  with  mis-\ncellaneous  nonfishery  commodities.  Consequently,  the  total\nvalue  of  fisheries  exports  cannot  be  determined  from  official\npublications.\n\nFor  imports,  when  the  data  identify  fishery  products,  the  qual-\nity  for  measuring  volumes/values  appears  better  than  that  for  ex-\nports.  For  some  countries,  however,  it  is  not  possible  to  determine\nthe  product  form  (fresh/frozen  vs.  canned),  which  creates  difficul-\nties  for  estimating  per  capita  consumption.\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n49\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f50\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\nAccess  Fees\n\nAccess fees are a charge for the right to harvest a resource. For\nthe purpose of national accounting, they are considered to be a charge\npaid  by  nonresidents  for  the  use  of  a  tangible  nonproduced  asset.\nThus,  the  fee  is  not  part  of  the  value  of  production  from  a  fishing\nactivity, and it is therefore not included in the calculation of the fish-\ning  contribution  to  GDP.\n\nSummary of Information\n\nAll Pacific Island countries received fees for foreign fishing activ-\nity in their waters. For many countries, information on the amounts\nof these fees is available in published documents; while in other cases,\nit must be estimated from fishing activity patterns. Table 11 presents\nthe  access  fees  received  in  1999  and  compares  these  fees  to  the\nnational  GDP.\n\nComments  on  Access  Fees\n\nIt may be tempting to compare the 1999 access fees above to the\nvalue of the 1999 catches under the category \u201cOffshore foreign-based\nvessels\u201d  to  determine  the  ratio  of  the  fee  to  the  value  of  the  catch.\nThis,  however,  would  be  inappropriate  as,  in  some  countries  (e.g.,\nFSM  and  Palau),  there  are  fee-paying  foreign  vessels  under  the  cat-\negory  \u201cOffshore  locally-based.\u201d\n\nIn  some  countries,  the  access  fees  form  a  very  large  portion  of\ngovernment  revenue.  In  the  FSM,  for  example,  the  1999  access  fees\nrepresented  an  estimated  39%  of  non-tax  revenue  and  22%  of\ntotal  domestic  revenue  for  the  national  government.  In  Kiribati,\n34%  of  government  income  in  1999  was  derived  from  license  fees.\nSome  interesting  features  from  the  information  presented  in\n\n(i) Access  fees  are  only  significant  for  7  of  the  14  Pacific  Island\n\nTable  11  above  are:\n\ncountries.\n\n(ii) There  is  one  case  (Niue)  in  which  an  apparently  small\naccess  fee  is  actually  quite  significant  in  terms  of  the  national\neconomy.\n\n(iii) There is another case (PNG) in which an apparently large access\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n50\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nSummary of Information on Employment, Exports and Imports...\n\n51\n51\n\nTable  11: Estimated  Value  of  Access  Fees  Received  from\nForeign  Fishing  Vessels  and  GDP,  1999\n\nCountry\n\nAccess Fees\n(US$)\n\nGDP\n(US$)\n\nAccess Fees\nas % of GDP\n\nKiribati\n\nTuvalu\n\nFSM\n\nNauru\n\nNiue\n\nPalau\n\nPNG\n\nTonga\n\nMarshall  Islands\n\nCook  Islands\n\nSolomon  Islands\n\nVanuatu\n\nSamoa\n\nFiji  Islands\n\n20,600,000\n\n5,900,000\n\n15,400,000\n\n3,400,000\n\n4,982,699\n\n151,793\n\n800,000\n\n169,072\n\n152,041\n\n273,458\n\n218,448\n\n188,616\n\n212,000\n\n48,123,871\n\n13,848,788\n\n229,869,864\n\n51,612,903\n\n97,311,800\n\n7,514,077\n\n113,484,869\n\n82,371,930\n\n157,018,257\n\n279,593,229\n\n226,280,313\n\n233,506,665\n\n1,821,334,281\n\n5,840,000\n\n3,415,590,478\n\n42.81\n\n42.60\n\n6.70\n\n6.59\n\n5.12\n\n2.02\n\n0.70\n\n0.21\n\n0.17\n\n0.10\n\n0.10\n\n0.10\n\n0.08\n\n0.01\n\nFSM = Federated States of Micronesia; GDP = gross domestic product; PNG = Papua New Guinea.\nSource:  As  per  country  access  fees  section  in  Appendix  2.\n\nfee  is  actually  quite  insignificant  in  terms  of  the  national\neconomy.\n\n(iv) For nearly half of the Pacific Island countries, the US multilat-\neral  treaty  provides  most  of  the  access  fees,  despite  the  fact\nthat there is little or no US fishing in those countries.\n\nFish  Consumption\n\nSummary of Information\n\nAppendix  2  contains  information  on  the  annual  per  capita\nconsumption  of  fishery  products  in  each  of  the  Pacific  Island  coun-\ntries.

The  exceptions  to  this  are  Tonga,  where  the\nstudies  suggest  surprisingly  low  fish  consumption  rates,  and\nPalau,  where  fish  consumption  rate  is  remarkably  high.\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n52\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nSummary of Information on Employment, Exports and Imports...\n\n53\n53\n\n(ii) Most  of  the  Pacific  Island  countries  exceed  by  a  large  margin\nthe world average per capita fishery product consumption rate\nof  13.0  kg  (Westlund  1995).\n\n(iii) Most of the estimates for Kiribati indicate that it has the high-\nest  rate  of  fish  consumption  compared  to  any  country  in  the\nworld.\n\nThe studies which provided the above estimates used a variety\n\nof  techniques:\n\n(i) nutrition studies in which the amount of fish and shellfish con-\n\nsumed  was  measured;\n\n(ii) nutrition  studies  based  on  dietary  recall;\n(iii) HIES  which  estimated  the  volume  of  fishery  products  con-\n\n(iv) exercises  in  which  the  fishery  production  is  divided  by  the\n\nsumed;\n\npopulation;  and\n\n(v) exercises  that  take  the  fishery  production  less  exports  plus\nimports to arrive at a gross consumption figure that is divided\nby  the  population.\n\nAlthough, in theory, the various techniques should give equiva-\nlent results, the situation in Niue is an example where different esti-\nmates  of  per  capita  consumption  were  calculated:\n\n(cid:127) Dalzell  et  al.  (1993)  estimated  per  capita  fish  consumption  us-\ning a 1987 SPC nutrition study. It indicated an annual per capita\nconsumption  of  40.8  kg  food  weight,  or  about  49.0  kg  whole\nfish  weight.\n\n(cid:127) Considering (i) the Niue population of 1,900 people in 2000 (Ryan\nand  Stepanoff  2000),  (ii)  the  subsistence  fisheries  production  of\n194  mt,  (iii)  the  commercial  production  of  12  mt,  and  (iv)  im-\nports  of  20  mt,  the  annual  per  capita  consumption  of  fishery\nproducts  in  Niue  appears  to  be  about  118.9  kg.\n\nThis variation suggests the need for some \u201cground truthing\u201d to\ngauge the validity of the estimation. This is especially important con-\nsidering that many of the total national fishery production estimates\nare  derived  from  nutrition  studies.\n\nQuantifying consumption by using import, export and produc-\n\ntion  data  is  complicated  by  several  factors:\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n53\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f54\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\n(i) The low quality of data on the export of fishery products;\n(ii) Uncertainty in some countries over whether the imports of fish-\n\nery  products  are  whole  fish  or  canned  fish;\n\n(iii) Where  there  is  a  large  tourist  industry,  not  knowing  the  full-\ntime-resident  equivalent  of  the  tourists.    Apparently,  only  the\nPalau  consumption  figures  take  this  into  consideration,  where\nthe  tourist  population  has  been  estimated  to  be  equivalent  to\n500  full-time  residents,  or  2.6%  of  the  population.\n\nAnother  important  issue  in  the  calculation  of  per  capita  fish\nconsumption concerns the estimate of the uppermost limit possible.\nSome  of  the  very  high  estimates  obtained  in  the  surveys  cited  in\nAppendix  2  (e.g.,  207.0  kg  per  capita  per  year  in  Kiribati)  are  criti-\ncized solely on the intuitive basis that it is not physically possible to\ningest such a large quantity of fish. However, careful examination of\nspecific  cases  suggests  that  this  concept  may  not  be  correct.  For  ex-\nample:\n\n(cid:127) Nube (1989) reported that the Kiribati canned fish imports from\n1974  to  1986  ranged  from  112  mt  to  312  mt  per  year.  Using\ninformation  from  the  1985  census,  Nube  calculated  the  daily\nper  capita  fish  consumption  for  18  islands  in  the  Gilbert  and\nLine  groups.  The  results  ranged  from  0.45  kg  in  South  Tarawa\nto  2.86  kg  in Arorae.  Of  the  18  islands  listed,  11  of  the  islands\n(or  61%)  have  a  per  capita  fish  consumption  rate  greater  than\none kg per day.\nPassfield  (1997)  calculated  the  annual  per  capita  consumption\nof  fish  in  Tongareva  Island  as  219.0  kg.\n\n(cid:127)\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n54\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\n\n55\n\nConclusions  and\nRecommendations\n\nThe  objectives  of  the  present  study  were  to  measure  the  eco-\nnomic  contribution  of  fisheries  to  the  economies  of  Pacific  Island\nnations  from  available  data  and  to  contribute  to  improving  the  ac-\ncuracy of this measurement. The conclusions and recommendations\nare  therefore  grouped  according  to  these  objectives.\n\nMeasuring  the  Economic  Contribution\n\nThe official fishing contribution to GDP in various Pacific Island\ncountries in 1999 is given in Section 4.1. The importance to the econo-\nmies  of  Pacific  Island  countries,  as  measured  by  the  percentage  of\nGDP, is given in the Figure 9.\n\nFigure  9: Official  Estimates  of  Fishing  Contribution  to  GDP  of\nPacific  Island  Countries,  1999\n\n%\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nP\nN\nG\n\nV\na\nn\nu\na\nt\nu\n\ni\n\nN\nu\ne\n\nN\na\nu\nr\nu\n\nP\na\na\nu\n\nl\n\nF\n\nl\n\ni\nj\ni\n \nI\ns\na\nn\nd\ns\n\nC\no\no\nk\n \nI\ns\na\nn\nd\ns\n\nl\n\nF\nS\nM\n\nT\nu\nv\na\nu\n\nl\n\nT\no\nn\ng\na\n\nl\n\nI\ns\na\nn\nd\ns\n\nM\na\nr\ns\nh\na\n\nl\nl\n\nS\na\nm\no\na\n\nK\n\ni\nr\ni\nb\na\nt\ni\n\nl\n\nI\ns\na\nn\nd\ns\n\nl\n\nS\no\no\nm\no\nn\n\nIn  countries  where  official  estimates  are  not  available  (Solomon  Islands,  Nauru),  estimates  were\nmade  during  this  study  for  purposes  of  comparison.\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n55\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f56\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\nA major conclusion of the present study is that, in most Pacific\nIsland countries, the fishing contribution to GDP has been underes-\ntimated.  In  five  countries,  the  consultants\u2019  estimates  are  more  than\ndouble that of the official figures. In two cases, the consultants\u2019 esti-\nmates  are  lower  than  the  official  estimates  albeit,  in  the  case  of  the\nCook Islands, the difference is too small to be significant. The differ-\nences  between  the  consultants\u2019  estimates  and  the  official  estimates\nare  shown  in  Table  13.\n\nTable  13: Difference  between  Consultants\u2019  and  Official\nEstimates  of  Fishing  Contribution  to  GDP\n\nCountry\n\nDifference in Estimates\n(+ / -) (%)\n\nIncreased\n\nPalau\nPapua  New  Guinea\nVanuatu\nFiji  Islands\nKiribati\nFederated  States  of  Micronesia\nNiue\nTonga\nTuvalu\n\nDecreased\n\nCook  Islands\nSamoa\nMarshall  Islands\n\nNauru\nSolomon  Islands\n\nNo Official Estimates\n\n+441.1\n+154.3\n+138.8\n+131.8\n+127.9\n+103.1\n+18.2\n+5.1\n+4.3\n\n-10.6\n-18.0\n-50.0\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\nThere  is  no  single  reason  for  the  differences  in  the  estimates.\nIn some countries, notably FSM and PNG, the differences are prima-\nrily  due  to  the  inclusion  of  subsistence  fishing  in  the  consultants\u2019\nestimates.  In  other  countries,  in  particular  Palau,  the  difference  is\nprimarily  due  to  the  methods  used.  In  most,  it  is  a  combination  of\ndifferences  in  the  estimate  of  production  and  the  method  used  to\ncalculate  the  contribution.  For  example,  in  Samoa,  subsistence  pro-\nduction  was  valued  at  the  full  market  value,  rather  than  at  \u201cfarm\ngate\u201d  prices.\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n56\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nConclusion and Recommendations\n\n57\n57\n\nAt  one  extreme,  both  Nauru  and  the  Solomon  Islands  have\nmajor  problems  preparing  their  national  accounts.  The  difficulty  in\ncomputing  the  fishing  component  of  these  accounts  is  part  of  the\noverall  problem. At  the  other  extreme,  Cook  Islands,  Niue,  Tonga\nand Tuvalu all compile soundly based national accounts that include\nreasonable  estimates  of  the  fishing  contribution.  In  most  of  these\nlatter  countries,  the  differences  between  the  consultants\u2019  estimates\nare  small.  In  general,  where  the  differences  between  the  estimates\nare  5.0%  or  less,  they  are  not  significant.\n\nThe major difference between the consultants\u2019 estimate and the\nofficial Marshall Islands estimate is due to what seems to be the in-\nclusion  in  the  official  figures  of  a  contribution  from  foreign  vessels\nthat  ceased  operating  sometime  earlier.\n\nThe main lesson learned is that, in the countries where the esti-\nmates  are  markedly  different,  the  process  of  preparing  the  national\naccounts  tends  to  rely  on  outdated  surveys,  inappropriate  indica-\ntors, and/or poorly understood methods. In most of these cases, the\ncompilers  of  national  accounts  do  not  appear  to  have  consulted  the\nrelevant  fisheries  agencies  or  the  industry  when  preparing  their\nestimates.\n\nWhere  there  is  a  marked  difference  between  the  consultants\u2019\nestimates and the official estimates, the compilers of national accounts\nshould  carefully  examine  and  evaluate  the  data,  the  assumptions,\nand the methods that they are using. This evaluation should include\nconsultation with the relevant domestic and regional fisheries agen-\ncies. Where significant problems are identified, they should consider\nchanging  their  methods  and/or  seeking  outside  assistance  to  revise\ntheir  methods  and  approaches  to  estimating  the  fishing  contribu-\ntion  to  GDP.\n\nImproving  the  Fishing  Contribution  Estimates\n\nA major conclusion of this study is that the accuracy of the esti-\nmate of fishing contribution to GDP could be improved with a closer\nliaison  between  the  fisheries  and  the  statistics  agencies.    The  fisher-\nies agencies are in a position to provide information on new develop-\nments, technical insights, and recent data, all of which could improve\nthe  GDP  estimates.  This  cooperation,  however,  rarely  occurs  in  the\nPacific  Island  countries.  Because  fisheries  agencies  have  a  vested\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n57\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f58\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\ninterest in assuring that the importance of their sector is not under-\nestimated,  they  should  take  the  lead  in  improving  this  cooperation.\nIt  is  recommended  that  the  fisheries  agencies  identify  an  appropri-\nate  staff  member  to  serve  as  the  liaison  with  the  statistics  agency\nand  with  regional  organizations.  The  work  program  of  this  indi-\nvidual should be modified to include duties related to measuring the\nfishing  sector\u2019s  economic  contribution.\n\nOne  of  the  factors  causing  an  underestimation  of  the  fishing\ncontribution  is  related  to  the  valuation  of  the  production  of  small-\nscale  fisheries.  The  fundamental  difficulty  is  lack  of  knowledge  of\nvolume  of  production  (for  which  values  could  easily  be  estimated).\nThe  low  quality  of  fisheries  statistics  is  a  persistent  problem  in  the\nPacific Island countries, and there do not appear to be any practical\nsolutions for many of the data problems in the fisheries sector. At a\nrecent Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/SPC Pacific Islands\nRegional  Workshop  on  Fisheries  Statistics,  most  of  the  country  rep-\nresentatives  acknowledged  the  low  level  of  information  on  small-\nscale  fisheries  production  and  the  lack  of  expertise  and/or  funding\nin  obtaining  the  information.  Given  this  reality,  it  is  recommended\nthat maximum use be made of survey opportunities outside the fish-\neries sector. At little additional cost, production information on small-\nscale  fisheries  could  be  collected  through  such  tools  as  the  national\ncensus,  nutrition  surveys,  agriculture  census,  HIES,  and  poverty\nstudies.  This  would  require  a  pro-active  approach  on  the  part  of\nfisheries  agencies  in  the  planning  stage  of  these  surveys  to  assure\nthat  useful  fisheries  data  are  obtained.\n\nIn many countries, the underestimation of the value of fisheries\nexports in official customs statistics is a major source of error in the\nestimation  of  the  fisheries  contribution.  The  export  information\nsituation  is  worse  in  fisheries  than  in  other  sectors.  In  the  countries\nwhere  this  problem  is  especially  acute,  it  is  recommended  that\nexport  valuation  be  based  on  a  broader  spectrum  of  information\nthan solely those provided by customs officials. These additional data\ncould  be  obtained  from  the  government  fisheries  agency,  industry,\nand  knowledgeable  individuals.  In  addition,  the  regional  organiza-\ntions involved in fisheries collect data that could be used in valuing\nexports.\n\nAdditional  information  on  the  economics  of  small-scale  fisher-\nies would contribute to improving the measurement of the fisheries\ncontribution  to  GDP.  This  information  would  improve  the  under-\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n58\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nConclusion and Recommendations\n\n59\n59\n\nstanding  of  input  ratios  (for  the  production  approach  to  GDP)  and\nthe  various  forms  of  income  (for  the  income  approach).  Such\nstudies need not be complex but should cover the major small-scale\ncommercial  and  subsistence  fisheries.\n\nThe  regional  organizations  could  play  an  important  role  in  im-\nproving the measurement of fisheries contribution to the economies\nof  their  member  countries.  Initiatives  could  include:\n\n(i) Measures to inform the national statistical agencies of the avail-\n\nability  of  information  relevant  to  fisheries  GDP  calculations:\n\n(a) SPC  databases  have  detailed  information  on  tuna  pro-\nduction  and  some  information  on  several  important  ex-\nport  commodities  (i.e.,    trochus,  beche-de-mer);\nFFA has information on the price of tuna in international\nmarkets.\n\n(b)\n\n(ii) Specifically  targeting  the  fisheries  sector  in  national/regional\n\nnational  accounts  training  courses;\n\n(iii) Developing  a  capability  within  the  regional  organizations  to\n\nundertake  analysis  of  the  economics  of  small-scale  fisheries;\n\n(iv) Advice on enhancing the work programs of the fisheries econo-\nmists of government fisheries agencies to facilitate more involve-\nment  in  measuring  the  economic  impact  of  their  sector;\n(v) Sponsorship of a regional meeting of fisheries economists. It is\nnoted  that  although  the  regional  organizations  have  held  a\nmultitude of meetings for the various fisheries subsectors (sur-\nveillance,  law,  management,  and  statistics),  there  has  never\nbeen a regional gathering of fisheries economists. Such a meet-\ning  could  have  a  positive  impact  on  increasing  understanding\nof technical issues, as well as generating interest among govern-\nment  fisheries  agencies  in  measuring  economic  contributions.\n\nOther  Conclusions  and  Recommendations\n\nThe income approach versus the production approach for the fisher-\nies  sector\n\nIn those circumstances where the compilers of national accounts\nhave  access  to  comprehensive  and  detailed  information  on  the  in-\ncome/expenditure  of  the  participants  in  one  or  more  sectors  of  the\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n59\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f60\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\nfishing  industry,  the  income  approach  is  the  most  appropriate\nmethod of calculating the value-added to GDP. In the Pacific Island\ncountries, it is, however, rare for this data to be available for fishing.\nIn  these  circumstances,  the  production  approach  is  likely  to  be  the\nmost  accurate  method  for  estimating  the  contribution  of  fishing  to\nGDP.  Even  when  the  compilers  of  national  accounts  have  access  to\ngood  quality  income/expenditure  data,  it  would  be  prudent  if  they\ncross-checked  their  calculations  against  estimates  made  using  the\nproduction  approach,  giving  special  attention  to  obtaining  accurate\nvalue-added  ratios  and  fish  prices.\n\nLevel  of  aggregation  in  national  accounts\n\nIn  the  national  accounts  of  most  Pacific  Island  countries,  fish-\ning  is  aggregated  with  agriculture  and  other  primary  industry.  In\nseveral  cases,  the  fishing  component  of  subsistence  is  lumped  toge-\nther with all other subsistence activities. This aggregation with other\nactivities  can  make  it  very  difficult  to  identify  the  contribution  of\nfishing  to  GDP.  This  practice  is  understandable  and  is  not  really  a\nproblem  when  the  fishing  contribution  to  GDP  is  very  small.  But\nwhen  fishing  makes  a  significant  contribution  to  GDP,  that  contri-\nbution  should  be  clearly  identifiable  in  national  accounts.\n\nIn the future, it is likely that an increasing share of the benefits\nfrom the fisheries sector will come from fish processing. Thus, there\nis a strong argument for the national accounts to disaggregate within\nthe food processing sector the specific contribution of fish processing.\n\nISIC  categories\n\nThere  are  marked  differences  between  the  value-added  by  dif-\nferent  fishing  activities  and,  therefore,  it  is  important  to  distinguish\nbetween  these  activities  when  estimating  their  contribution  to  GDP.\nAt a minimum, analysts should distinguish between large-scale off-\nshore fishing, small-scale commercial fishing, and subsistence fishing.\nThe small-scale commercial fishing should be further disaggregated\ninto  export-oriented  and  local  supply.  Creating  expanded  ISIC  sub-\ncategories  to  cover  at  least  these  activities  could  facilitate  this.\n\nClassifying  subsistence  activities\n\nOne of the difficulties facing any analysts using the production\napproach  is  determining  the  appropriate  value-added  ratios.  This\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n60\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nConclusion and Recommendations\n\n61\n61\n\ncan be particularly difficult for subsistence fishing where the activi-\nties  range  from  reef  gleaning,  which  requires  very  few  inputs,  to\ntrolling for tuna, where the costs of fuel, lures and boat maintenance\nare substantial. The large differences between the value-added ratios\nof these activities make it important to have a clear idea of the pro-\nportion  of  fishing  undertaken  using  each  activity.  While  it  may  be\nimpractical  to  try  and  identify  the  value-added  ratios  for  each  pos-\nsible  subsistence  activity,  at  the  least  the  ratios  between  motorized\nand  nonmotorized  activities  should  be  differentiated.\n\nExtrapolation  of  HIES  data\n\nIn most cases, HIES are sample surveys that rely on the memory\nof  the  respondents  to  estimate  the  level  of  consumption/expendi-\nture. Even when properly implemented, there is considerable scope\nfor errors in the estimates produced by HIES. As the length of time\nover  which  the  data  are  extrapolated  increases,  the  risk  of  error  is\ncompounded. It is normal for changes in the overall population size\nto be used to extrapolate consumption/expenditure data. Given the\nmarked  differences  between  the  consumption  and  production  pat-\nterns  of  rural/urban  and  coastal/inland  populations,  the  use  of\nchanges in the overall population size to extrapolate HIES data could\nresult in a biased estimate.\n\nEconomic  impact  of  fisheries\n\nWhile GDP is an important measure of the role of fishing in an\neconomy,  it  does  not  give  the  overall  impact  that  fishing  has  on  an\neconomy. Although a study of the multiplier effects of fishing would\nlead  to  a  greater  understanding  of  economic  impacts,  there  is  little\ninformation  in  the  Pacific  Island  countries  from  which  the  multi-\nplier  effects  of  fishing  can  be  estimated.  In  fact,  there  is  very  little\ninformation available to estimate the multiplier impact of any activ-\nity in the Pacific economies. It is recommended that further work be\nundertaken  to  estimate  the  multiplier  effects  of  fishing  on  national\nincome  and  employment  in  the  Pacific  Island  countries.\n\n \n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n61\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\n\n63\n\nReferences\n\nAbbott,  D.

It  was\nbelieved that, at the very least, the re-estimates would provide use-\nful  comparators  for  the  compilers  of  national  accounts.  In  addition,\nit  was  anticipated  that  the  review  of  the  different  methods  and  ap-\nproaches  used  in  each  country  would  provide  useful  insights  into\nthe  effectiveness  of  alternative  approaches  to  the  task.\n\nIn some of the countries, the methods used to calculate the fish-\neries  component  of  GDP  were  well  documented.  In  others,  this  in-\nformation was obtained verbally. It is likely that at least some of the\nverbal  information  were  inaccurate  for  various  reasons,  including\nthe provider being unfamiliar with the subject. This should be taken\ninto  account  when  considering  the  comments  on  any  weakness  in\nthe  methodology.\n\nCook Islands\n\nThe Nominal Contribution of Fishing to GDP\n\nThe  consultants  estimate  that  the  fishing  contribution  to  Cook\nIslands  GDP  in  2000  was  about  NZ$17.3  million,  slightly  less  than\nthe  NZ$19.4  million  reported  in  the  official  figures.\n\nIt is noted that the official figures were radically revised in 2000\nwith  the  reported  contribution  of  fishing  to  GDP  increasing  from\nNZ$4.4 million in 1999 to NZ$19.4 million. This increase was due to\nan improvement in the measurement of exports of black pearls, part\nof which is believed to be unrecorded.\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n77\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f78\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\n0\n0\n0\n2\n\n9\n9\n9\n1\n\n8\n9\n9\n1\n\n7\n9\n9\n1\n\n6\n9\n9\n1\n\nm\ne\nt\nI\n\n0\n0\n0\n2\n\u2013\n6\n9\n9\n1\n \n,\ns\nd\nn\na\nl\ns\nI\n \n\nk\no\no\nC\n\n \nf\no\n\n \n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\nn\no\nC\n\n \n\ng\nn\ni\nh\ns\ni\nF\n\n \n\nd\nn\na\n \n\nP\nD\nG\n\n \nl\na\ni\nc\ni\nf\nf\n\nO\n\n:\n1\n.\n1\nA\n \ne\nl\nb\na\nT\n\n)\n$\nZ\nN\n\n(\n\n0\n0\n0\n,\n9\n9\n5\n,\n1\n7\n1\n\n0\n0\n0\n,\n0\n5\n6\n,\n5\n5\n1\n\n0\n0\n0\n,\n4\n9\n2\n,\n6\n4\n1\n\n0\n0\n0\n,\n9\n3\n2\n,\n4\n4\n1\n\n0\n0\n0\n,\n9\n6\n0\n,\n9\n4\n1\n\n)\ns\ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n \nt\ne\nk\nr\na\nm\n\n \nt\nn\ne\nr\nr\nu\nc\n(\n \n\nP\nD\nG\n\n0\n0\n0\n,\n9\n1\n9\n,\n4\n1\n\n0\n0\n0\n,\n1\n9\n4\n,\n4\n\ni\n\ng\nn\nh\ns\nF\n\ni\n\ni\n\n \nl\na\nc\nr\ne\nm\nm\no\nC\n\ni\n\ng\nn\nh\ns\nF\n\ni\n\n \ne\nc\nn\ne\nt\ns\n\ni\n\ns\nb\nu\nS\n\nP\nD\nG\n\n \no\nt\n \nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\nn\no\nC\n\ni\n\n \ng\nn\nh\ns\nF\n\ni\n\n0\n0\n0\n,\n0\n1\n4\n,\n9\n1\n\n0\n0\n0\n,\n5\n1\n4\n,\n4\n\n0\n0\n0\n,\n9\n0\n9\n,\n3\n\n0\n0\n0\n,\n3\n5\n4\n,\n1\n\n0\n0\n0\n,\n6\n7\n7\n,\n1\n\nl\n\ne\nu\na\nV\n \ny\nB\n\n3\n.\n1\n1\n\n8\n.\n2\n\n7\n.\n2\n\n0\n.\n1\n\n2\n.\n1\n\n)\n\n%\n\n(\n \ne\nr\na\nh\nS\n \ny\nB\n\n.\n)\n1\n0\n0\n2\n \nt\ns\nu\ng\nu\nA\n\n \n,\n.\n\nm\no\nc\n \n.\ns\nr\ne\np\n(\n \ne\nc\ni\nf\nf\n\nO\n\n \ns\nc\ni\nt\ns\ni\nt\na\nt\nS\n\n \ny\nb\n \ns\ne\nt\na\nd\np\nU\n\n \n,\na\nt\na\nd\n \nd\ne\nh\ns\n\ni\nl\n\nb\nu\np\nn\nu\n \ne\nc\ni\nf\nf\n\nO\n\n \ns\nc\ni\nt\ns\ni\nt\na\nt\nS\n\n \n,\n)\n0\n0\n0\n2\n(\n \ne\nc\ni\nf\nf\n\nO\n\n \ns\nc\ni\nt\ns\ni\nt\na\nt\nS\n\n \n:\ns\ne\nc\nr\nu\no\nS\n\n.\nr\na\n\nl\nl\n\nl\n\no\nd\n \nd\nn\na\na\ne\nZ\nw\ne\nN\n=\n\n \n\n \n\n \n$\nZ\nN\n\n \n;\nt\nc\nu\nd\no\nr\np\n \nc\ni\nt\ns\ne\nm\no\nd\n \ns\ns\no\nr\ng\n \n\n \n\n=\nP\nD\nG\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n78\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nAppendix 1\n\n79\n79\n\nBackground\n\nThe  Government\u2019s  Statistics  Office  prepares  the  Cook  Islands\nnational  accounts.  The  most  recently  published  tables  include  GDP\nestimates  from  1982  to  2000.  The  published  accounts  show  both\ncurrent  and  real  GDP  estimates  for  each  of  the  major  sectors  and\nindustry groups in the economy. For publication purposes, the fish-\ning  industry  is  grouped  with Agriculture.\n\nThe  Statistics  Office  uses  a  production  approach  to  calculate\nthe contribution of small- and large-scale commercial fishing to GDP.\nThe Office relies upon a combination of export records, fisheries sur-\nveys  and  market  prices  to  determine  the  gross  output  of  these  sub-\nsectors.  Production  by  the  subsistence  sector  is  imputed  from  data\ncollected  in  the  1998  Household  Income  and  Expenditure  Survey\n(HIES) that measured household and per capita consumption of fish.\n\nMethods  used  to  Calculate  Contribution  to  GDP\n\nTo  calculate  the  contribution  of  fishing  to  GDP,  the  Statistics\nOffice divided the sector into two categories, each with subcategories.\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\nIncorporated  Fishing  Enterprises.  This  category  covers  all  full-\nscale  commercial  operations  including  pearl  farming,  live  fish\nexports (aquarium fish), and tuna and other fishing. The value-\nadded output ratios for each of these subcategories are (i) pearl,\n80%;  (ii) pearl shell, 90%; (iii) live fish, 80%; and (iv) tuna and\nother fish, 60%. The value-added ratios appear reasonable given\nthe  nature  of  the  different  activities.\nSubsistence  Fishing.  The  contribution  of  subsistence  fishing  in-\ncludes  fishing  for  home  consumption  and  for  informal  sales.\nThe  estimated  contribution  from  home  consumption  is  based\nupon  the  1998  HIES.  The  values  for  the  years  since  1998  are\nextrapolated  using  population  and  a  composite  index  to  adjust\nfor prices changes and periods of intensive subsistence activity.\nThe  estimate  of  the  contribution  of  informal  sales  assumes  that\nsuch  sales  are  a  proportion  of  home  consumption.\n\nComments on the GDP Calculation\n\nThe methods used by the Statistics Office are appropriate. How-\n\never,  there  are  questions  about  the  accuracy  of  some  of  the  data.\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n79\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f80\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\nThe  substantial  increase  in  the  fishing  contribution  to  GDP\nbetween  1999  and  2000  captured  most  of  the  value  added  of  the\nsector.  However,  the  Manihiki  disease  survey  carried  out  by  the\nMinistry  of  Marine  Resources  in  December  2000  on  Manihiki  and\nPenrhyn  atolls  indicated  that  the  production  may  be  even  higher\nthan  previously  thought  (Ponia  pers.  com.).  In  particular,  the  pub-\nlished  national  accounts  may  not  have  taken  into  account  domestic\nsales of pearls to tourists. The survey indicates that the gross output\nin 2000 was NZ$20.4 million, NZ$2.0 million more than the estimate\nused  to  compile  the  GDP  estimate  reported  in  the  2000  national\naccounts.  In  addition,  the  contribution  of  live  fish  (NZ$250,000),\ntuna  and  other  fish  (NZ$200,000,  principally  trochus)  as  estimated\nby  the  Ministry  of  Marine  Resources  have  not  been  included  in  the\ncalculation  (Bertram  pers.  com.).\n\nOne of the difficulties facing the compilers of national accounts\nis the choice of data series. In the case of the Cook Islands, the Statis-\ntics Office has chosen to use the official trade figures rather than the\nestimates  prepared  by  the  Ministry  of  Marine  Resources  that  have\nbeen used in this report. Officials from the Statistics Office indicated\nthat  there  were  several  sources  of  data  for  pearl  production  includ-\ning one from the Pearl Federation. The information in each of these\nsets of data differs. In the circumstances, the Statistics Office elected\nto use the official trade figures because they are compiled regularly\nand are likely to be ongoing.\n\nImputing  production  from  the  data  reported  in  an  HIES  is  a\nvalid  method  to  calculate  the  contribution  of  subsistence  fishing  to\nGDP, provided there is no better source of data available. The method\nrelies  upon  the  HIES  being  an  accurate  reflection  of  contemporary\nconsumption  of,  and/or  expenditure  on,  fish.  The  older  the  HIES\nthe  less  likely  it  is  to  be  relevant.  The  assumption  that  informal\nsales  are  a  proportion  of  household  consumption  should  also  be\nreconsidered.\n\nIn the Cook Islands, there are other estimates of subsistence and\nsmall-scale commercial fishing production. Dalzell et al. (1996) used\ndata sources from the late 1980s and early 1990s to estimate subsis-\ntence  fishing  and  commercial  coastal  fishing  production.  They  con-\ncluded  that  the  amount  and  value  of  production  were,  respectively,\n858  mt  (US$3,047,683)  and  124  mt  (US$314,761).  According  to  the\nMinistry  of  Marine  Resources,  in  2000,  small-scale  commercial  fish-\ning  (informal  sales)  produced  80  mt  valued  at  NZ$650,000  and\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n80\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nAppendix 1\n\n81\n81\n\nsubsistence  production  amounted  to  795  mt  worth  NZ$2,200,000\n(Bertram pers. com.). The Statistics Office should examine these data\nand  determine  whether  or  not  they  support  the  information  gath-\nered in the HIES.\n\nRevised  Estimates  of  GDP\n\nIncorporated  fishing  enterprises:\n\nNZ$18,400,000\nPearls  and  pearl  shell:\nLive fish:\nNZ$252,000\nOthers  (principally  trochus): NZ$200,000\n\n*\n*\n*\n\n0.80 = NZ$14,720,000\nNZ$201,600\n0.80 =\nNZ$160,000\n0.80 =\n\nSource  of  data:  Ministry  of  Marine  Resources  (Bertram  and  Ponia,  pers.\ncom.).

The SAM includes data on the contribution of fishing and fish-\neries  to  GDP.  These  data  were  used  to  construct  Table A1.4.\n\nThe  consultants  estimate  that  the  fishing  contribution  to  GDP\nin  1998  was  US$21.95  million.  The  consultants\u2019  estimate  is  about\ndouble  the  EMPAT  estimate.

It is not known whether the SAM is still a work-in-progress or\nhad  been  finalized  at  the  time  the  data  were  extracted.  In  the  cir-\ncumstances,  the  following  should  be  treated  as  commentary  on  the\nissues  that  should  be  addressed  rather  than  a  critique  of  the  SAM.\n\nMethods  used  to  Calculate  Contribution  to  GDP\n\nIn  1996,  675  establishments  in  the  FSM  were  surveyed.  The  re-\nsults included information on employment, wages, and value added,\nwhich  were  used  to  compile  the  nonsubsistence  component  of  the\nGDP. With regard to the subsistence component of the economy, NSO\n(1998)  states:\n\n\u201cThe value of agricultural and fisheries output produced and\nconsumed by the same household was estimated for each of the four\nFSM  states  as  follows:\n\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n\nThe  population  in  1996  was  estimated;\nThe  level  of  food  imports  was  estimated  for  1996  (Kosrae  has\nthe  only  data,  the  value  was  estimated  for  the  other  states);\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n83\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f84\n\n(cid:127)\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\nThe  daily  per  capita  value  of  food  imports  was  calculated  and\nconverted  to  daily  per  capita  number  of  calories  (2,258  calories\nper dollar of imported food);\n\n(cid:127) Assuming  the  per  capita  calories  consumed  in  FSM  is  2,400,\nthis  equals  imported  calories  (given  above)  plus  calories  which\nare  obtained  from  local  foods;\nBy assuming that the calories per dollar of local food is 1,577, a\ntotal  dollar  value  of  local  food  consumed  per  capita  can  be\nobtained.\u201d\n\n(cid:127)\n\nThe consultants were advised that the SAM prepared by EMPAT\nused  1998  GDP  data  from  the  public  enterprise  accounts  for  large-\nscale  fishing  and  processing.  Data  from  a  household  survey  were\nused  to  measure  the  contribution  of  the  small-scale  commercial\nfishing.  EMPAT  staff  has  confirmed  that  the  SAM  only  includes\nestimates  for  the  cash  part  of  the  economy  and  does  not  include\nsubsistence.\n\nOther studies of the fishing or fisheries industry have been un-\ndertaken, including (i) Petersen (2001) who cites a variety of sources\nand  indicates  that  the  \u201cfishing  industry\u201d  was  responsible  for  15.5%\nof  the  FSM  GDP  in  1990,  and  (ii)  World  Bank  (1995)  which  stated\nthat,  in  1996,  \u201cfisheries\u201d  was  responsible  for  6.0%  of  the  FSM  GDP.\nGiven the history of poor quality data and the limited resources\nthat have been committed to improving the quality of the data, it is\ndifficult to give much credibility to the available estimates of fishing\ncontribution  to  GDP.\n\nComments on the GDP Calculation\n\nThe  World  Bank\u2019s  1996  estimate:\n\n(cid:127)\n\nThe  documentation  supporting  the  NSO  estimate  of  GDP  pro-\nvides  a  concise  outline  of  the  approach  used  to  measure  GDP,\nbut  it  does  not  provide  details  of  the  actual  calculations.  The\ndescription  of  the  approach  includes  the  general  comment  that\n\u201cthe production approach was used to measure the value added\nof  individual  establishments  and  a  cost  approach  was  used  to\ncompute the value added of government services and non-profit\ninstitutions.\u201d\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n84\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nAppendix 1\n\n85\n85\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\nThe  calculation  of  the  value  added  by  subsistence  activities  in\nthe  NSO  publication  seems  to  give  an  estimate  of  the  value  of\nlocally-produced food, not the purported  \u201cvalue of agricultural\nand fisheries output produced and consumed by the same house-\nhold.\u201d  If  this  is  an  accurate  reflection  of  the  calculation,  the\n\u201cAgriculture,  Hunting,  Forestry  (includes  Subsistence  Fishing\n[emphasis added])\u201d item in Table A1. 3 would be more correctly\ndescribed  as  \u201cAgriculture,  Hunting,  Forestry  (includes  agricul-\nture/fishing  for  local  consumption  [emphasis  added]).\u201d\n\nThe  1998  SAM  estimate:\n\nThe estimate does not include the contribution made by subsis-\ntence fishing, nor that made by the large-scale tuna purse seiner\nbased  in  Chuuk.\nThe  small-scale  commercial  fishing  contribution  is  calculated\nusing  the  income  approach.

In  constant  1989  prices,  the  contribution  in\n1999  was  around  F$48.9  million,  which  is  about  34.0%  higher  than\nthe  official  estimate.\n\nBackground\n\nThe  Bureau  of  Statistics  calculates  the  GDP  estimates  for  the  Fiji\nIslands.  The  various  components  of  fisheries  are  not  reported  sepa-\nrately in the published estimates of GDP in current prices. Subsistence\nfishing  is  included  in  the  overall  \u201cSubsistence\u201d  sector.  Commercial\nfishing,  including  small-scale  and  offshore  fishing,  is  included  in  the\n\u201cAgriculture, Forestry and Fishing\u201d sector. Fish handling, processing,\nmarketing,  and  transport  activities  are  spread  through  the  \u201cFood\nManufacturing,\u201d  \u201cWholesale  and  Retail,\u201d  and  \u201cTransport\u201d  sectors.\n\nMethods  used  to  Calculate  Contribution  to  GDP\n\nThe  Bureau  of  Statistics  has  a  three-page  explanation  of  the\nmethod  it  used  to  calculate  the  contribution  of  the  fishing  industry\nto  GDP.  According  to  that  document,  \u201cthe  fishing  industry  is  di-\nvided  into  four  sectors:\u201d\n\n(cid:127)\n\nIndustrial  fishery\u2014operates  on  a  large  scale  and  is  export\noriented.\n\n(cid:127) Artisanal fishery\u2014comprises  small-scale  commercial  production.\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127) Aquaculture\u2014largely  experimental.\n\nSubsistence  fishery\u2014the  production-cum-consumption  sector.\n\nIn practice, the calculation of the fishing contribution is limited\nto  the  industrial  fishery  and  the  artisanal  fishery.  The  contribution  of\nthe  subsistence  fishery  is  included  as  part  of  the  overall  contribution\nof  subsistence.  Currently,  the  contribution  of  aquaculture  is  trivial,\nand  it  is  ignored  in  the  calculations.\n\nThe  contributions  of  industrial  and  artisanal  fishing  have  been\nestimated using a production approach. In the case of the industrial\nfishing,  the  gross  output  and  intermediate  cost  data  were  obtained\nfrom a survey of the large-scale fishing companies. The contribution\nof  artisanal  fishing  was  estimated  from  information  obtained  in  a\nsurvey of commercial fishers and data from loan applications made\nto  the  Fiji  Development  Bank.\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n87\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f88\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\nThe  contribution  of  subsistence  fishing  to  GDP  is  included  in\nthe Bureau\u2019s estimate of the contribution of overall subsistence pro-\nduction.  The  calculation  is  based  upon  data  collected  in  the  1991\nhousehold  expenditure  survey.  The  survey  collected  aggregate  data\nand it is not possible to single out the fishing component.\n\nOfficials  at  the  Bureau  of  Statistics  advised  that  it  was  not  cur-\nrently  possible  to  separate  the  contribution  of  fish  processing  from\nthe  \u201cManufacturing  \u2013  Other  Food  Industries\u201d  category.\n\nComments on the GDP Calculation\n\nAt least in theory, the methods used by the Bureau of Statistics\nto measure the contributions of industrial fishery and artisanal fishery\nto GDP should produce reasonable estimates of the sectors\u2019 contribu-\ntion to GDP. The results, however, suggest that they are significantly\nundervaluing  the  contributions.\n\nOne important issue is the valuation of gross output. The com-\npleteness  of  the  fish  export  data  is  suspect.  The  primary  source  for\nexport  data  is  the  Customs  records,  which  understate  the  export\nquantity and value. Discussions with Customs officials indicate that,\nsince  there  are  no  revenue  or  enforcement  issues  associated  with\nexports, they have little incentive to ensure the records are accurate.\nIn  particular,  the  prices  quoted  on  export  invoices  understate  the\nprice  that  is  eventually  received.  Exporters  are  required  to  indicate\nthe  price  received  for  their  product  on  the  export  documentation\nprior  to  shipping.  Since  the  eventual  sale  price  is  unknown  at  the\ntime of export, the figures recorded are not correct. Not surprisingly,\nmost  exporters  usually  record  a  conservative  price  on  their  export\ndocumentation.  This  understated  price  is  the  price  that  is  recorded\nin the statistical database. Needless to say, the combination of a low\nprice  and  inaccurate  quantities  results  in  a  markedly  lower  gross\noutput value and, hence, an underestimate of the subsector\u2019s contri-\nbution  to  GDP.\n\nThe  ratios  of  intermediate  consumption  to  gross  output  being\nused  by  the  Bureau  were  obtained  from  surveys  of  the  large-scale\nfishing enterprises and from field interviews of medium- and small-\nscale  fishers.  The  large-scale  fishing  enterprises  are  involved  in  the\noffshore fishery. The value-added ratio derived for this sector is 53.5%.\nThis ratio appears to be a little high when compared to the informa-\ntion in reports on the fishery in the Fiji Islands and elsewhere. Both\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n88\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nAppendix 1\n\n89\n89\n\nmedium-scale and small-scale fishing identified in the report supply\nthe local market and collect marine products for processing and ex-\nport. Bureau officials advised that the two activities were differenti-\nated by the nature of their customer base and the type of associated\nfacilities involved in the activity. Medium-scale fishing is a full-time\nactivity that typically supplied fresh fish to established retail outlets\nand  usually  maintained  cold  storage  facilities.  The  value-added  ra-\ntio  for  this  activity  was  assessed  to  be  54.7%.  This  ratio  is  slightly\nlower than that indicated in other comparative data. The small-scale\nfishing  activity  included  occasional  fishing  and  those  fishers  that\ntypically  sold  their  catch  at  the  local  market  or  on  the  side  of  the\nroad.  Normally,  this  activity  does  not  have  associated  cold  storage\nfacilities.  The  survey  produced  a  value-added  ratio  of  55.5%.  This\nratio is close to the mean of the values indicated by other sources.\n\nRevised  Estimates  of  GDP\n\nOffshore  locally-based  fishing:\n\n5,500  mt\n\n*\n\nF$9,200\n\n*\n\n0.50\n\n= F$25,300,000\n\nSource  of  data: Production  and  price  information  as  per  Appendix  2.

The  most  recent  estimates  available  to  the  consultants\nare the unpublished information in Table A1. 8, which was prepared\nby  the  Statistics  Office.\n\nDue to problems with the airline service to Tarawa, the consult-\nants  were  unable  to  visit  Kiribati.  The  data  used  in  the  following\ndiscussion were obtained from an adviser to the Ministry of Finance,\nthe  consultants\u2019  own  library,  and  other  secondary  sources.\n\nMethods  used  to  Calculate  Contribution  to  GDP\n\nThe  contribution  of  fishing  to  GDP  is  separated  into  two  sub-\n\nsectors:  commercial  fishing  and  subsistence  fishing.\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\nCommercial Fishing. This category covers the fish that are caught\nfor sale. The consultants were advised that the calculation used\nto determine the value added by commercial fishing was based\non informal surveys of the number of fish ice-boxes on the side\nof  the  road  in  South  Tarawa.  Statistics  Office  staff  occasionally\ncount the number of boxes; they then impute the amount of fish\nin  each  box  and  multiply  the  estimated  volume  of  fish  by  an\nassumed average price. Estimated input costs are then deducted\nto arrive at the value added to GDP.\nSubsistence  Fishing.  The  contribution  to  GDP  is  calculated  by\ntaking  the  household  expenditure  figures  from  household  ex-\npenditure  surveys.  In  years  for  which  there  are  no  household\nexpenditure  surveys,  the  contribution  is  extrapolated  by  the\npopulation  increase.\n\nComments on the GDP Calculation\n\nThe method used to calculate the contribution of commercial fish-\ning  to  GDP  is  indirect  and unreliable.  In  addition,  if  that  is  the  sole\nmethod used, the value added by seaweed, aquarium fish, and other\nmarine  products  are  not  included.\n\nThere have been a number of studies into the production of fish\nand marine products in Kiribati (see Appendix 2). In all cases, these\nstudies  indicate  levels  of  production  that  markedly  exceed  the\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n91\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f92\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\nproduction  level  implicit  in  the  official  figures.  The  values  of  sea-\nweed  production  and  other  marine  products  are  reported  in  the\nGovernment\u2019s  1998  Economic  Statement  (National  Economic  Plan-\nning Office [NEPO] 1999). Annual data on these activities should be\navailable and relatively easy to collect from exporters. In the circum-\nstances, it seems highly likely that the official figures underestimate\nthe  contribution  of  commercial  fishing  to  GDP,  and  that  these  esti-\nmates could be relatively easily improved.\n\nWhile the approach to measuring the contribution of subsistence\nfishing  is  reasonable,  it  is  based  on  dated  information  and  produc-\ntion  is  imputed  from  consumption  data.  There  is  a  significant  body\nof literature that measures the volume of subsistence production (see\nAppendix  2),  which  could  be  used  to  prepare  a  more  reliable  esti-\nmate  of  the  sector\u2019s  contribution  to  GDP.  It  should  be  a  relatively\nstraightforward  process  to  calculate  the  contribution  from  existing\nproduction  estimates  and  contemporary  price  data.\n\nThe  production  approach  could  be  used  to  estimate  intertem-\nporal changes in fishing contribution to GDP. This could be done by\nimputing per capita consumption figures from production data and\npopulation statistics for each year. The consumption rate could then\nbe  used  with  changes  in  population  to  extrapolate  the  commercial\nfishing  and  subsistence  fishing  contribution  to  GDP.  This  approach\nis similar to the method used when extrapolating HIES data by popu-\nlation.  While  analysts  often  have  little,  if  any,  alternative,  it  does\nimply the assumption that the consumption/production rate remains\nconstant over time. It remains axiomatic that better data enable bet-\nter estimates to be made. In part, this could be addressed by improv-\ning the interchange of information between the Statistics Office and\nthe Fisheries Division. Ideally, more frequent HIES and fisheries sec-\ntor studies should be carried out.\n\nRevised  Estimates  of  GDP\n\nCommercial  fishing:\n\nGeneral\nAquarium  fish:\nSeaweed:\n\n6,000  mt\n\n*\n\nA$2,100\nA$1,800,000\nA$210,000\n\n* 0.65 = A$8,190,000\n* 0.80 = A$1,440,000\nA$189,000\n* 0.90 =\n\nSource  of  data: Production  and  price  information  as  per  Appendix  2.

The  consultants\u2019  estimate  is  lower  by\n50%  than  the  official  estimate.  It  appears  that  the  official  estimates\nhave not taken into account the fact that the offshore foreign vessels\nthat had been operating in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI)\ndeparted before the end of 1998 (Marshall Islands Marine Resources\nAuthority  [MIMRA]  2000).  While  these  vessels  were  operating  in\nthe  RMI,  they  added  around  US$3.4  million  to  GDP.\n\nBackground\n\nThe  Government\u2019s  Office  of  Planning  and  Statistics  prepares\nthe national accounts for the RMI. The methods used to prepare the\nnational  accounts  are  based  upon  a  report  prepared  by  the  Forum\nSecretariat  in  1992.  The  national  accounts  section  of  the  latest  Sta-\ntistical Abstract  (Office  of  Planning  and  Statistics  2000a)  states  that\n\u201cthe  estimates  for  1991  and  1992  prepared  by  a  Forum  Secretariat\nconsultant  are  based  on  the  value-added  approach.  For  this  exer-\ncise, an establishment survey as well as a housing survey [sic] were\nconducted for gathering the necessary data on various sectors of the\neconomy  and  the  information  obtained  in  this  manner  was  used  in\nthe  GDP  estimates.  The  estimates  for  1993  through  1995  are  based\non the value-added approach following the methodology of the Fo-\nrum  Secretariat,  with  revisions  where  appropriate.\u201d\n\nMethods  used  to  Calculate  Contribution  to  GDP\n\nThe  Office  of  Planning  and  Statistics  provided  considerable  in-\nformation  on  calculating  the  fisheries  component  of  GDP,  including\na  two-page  information  sheet  on  the  methods  used.  The  sector  is\ndivided into four subsectors:\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\nLarge-scale  Fishing.  This  sector  includes  the  offshore  fishing\nvessels. At  various  times  in  the  past,  large  numbers  of  foreign\nfishing vessels, notably from Taipei,China, have operated out of\nRMI. While these vessels were operating out of the RMI, it was\nappropriate  to  include  them  in  fishing\u2019s  estimated  contribution\nto  GDP. At  present,  there  is  no  locally-based  large-scale  fishing\nactivity  in  the  RMI.\nSmall-scale  Commercial  Fishing.  Small-scale  commercial  fish-\ning activities include the supply of fish to the local market and\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n94\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nAppendix 1\n\n95\n95\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\nthe production of some other marine products. It is carried out\nthroughout  most  of  the  islands  of  the  RMI.  According  to\nMIMRA, about half of the activity is attributable to boats oper-\nating  through  the  MIMRA  outer  islands  project.\nPet  Fish  Harvest.  The  export  of  aquarium  fish  (pet  fish)  and\nassociated marine organisms is a significant business in the RMI.\nSubsistence Fishing. Since the departure of the offshore commer-\ncial vessels, subsistence fishing has become the single largest con-\ntributor  to  the  fishing  sector  of  GDP.  The  collection  of  marine\nproducts  is  particularly  important  in  the  outer  islands  where\nthey  provide  a  substantial  proportion  of  household  diets.\n\nComments on the GDP Calculation\n\nThe  estimates  of  the  contribution  of  large-scale  fishing  to  GDP\nare complicated by the involvement of foreign-owned offshore fish-\ning companies. The Ting Hong company operation in the mid-1990s\nis  an  example.  For  several  years,  Ting  Hong  managed  a  fleet  of\nchartered  Chinese  vessels  operating  out  of  the  RMI.  The  operation\nwas  clearly  based  in  the  RMI  for  over  12  months,  and  the  official\nGDP  estimates  follow  the  System  of  National Accounts  (SNA)  con-\nvention  by  including  the  wages  paid  to  all  crew  (domestic  and  for-\neign)  and  the  surplus  generated  by  the  operation.  It  appears  that,\ndespite  the  departure  of  these  vessels  before  the  end  of  1998,  the\nofficial  GDP  figures  continue  to  report  a  substantial  contribution\nfrom  the  vessels  in  1999.\n\nThe  contribution  of  small-scale  commercial  fishing  is  calculated\nfrom  the  records  of  the  MIMRA\u2019s  outer  islands  project.  However,\nMIMRA  advised  the  consultants  that  the  catch  going  through  this\nproject is only about half the fish caught/sold in the RMI by small-\nscale  fishers.  Therefore,  the  calculated  contribution  understates  the\nvalue-added  by  small-scale  commercial  fishing.\n\nThere  is  a  risk  that  the  calculation  of  the  subsistence  fishing\ncontribution  to  GDP  may  double-count  the  catch  of  small-scale\ncommercial fishing. This catch of the small-scale commercial fishing\noperations is primarily sold in the RMI where it is consumed in house-\nholds. It is therefore quite possible that the fish measured as part of\nthe  catch  is  also  measured  as  part  of  consumption.\n\nThe Office of Planning and Statistics worksheet on methods used\nto  calculate  the  contribution  of  subsistence  fishing  shows  the  pro-\nduction  of  fish  in  1996  to  be  3,185,928  pounds.  This  appears  to  be\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n95\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f96\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\nthe actual weight of the food (i.e., not the whole fish weight). If so, it\nwould equate to a per capita fish consumption of about 59.0 kg per\nyear.  This  amount  does  not  seem  unreasonable.  It  is  similar  to  the\nconsumption levels measured in neighboring countries with similar\nconditions  to  the  RMI.\n\nA  large-scale  loining  operation  started  in  Majuro  in  October\n1999.  It  has  been  reported  that  this  operation  is  paying  as  much  as\nUS$85,000  per  month  in  wages  (MIMRA  2000).  Under  the  standard\nSNA  convention,  the  value  added  by  the  loining  operation  would\nnormally be allocated to the food-processing sector. However, given\nthe  small  size  of  the  nonfish  food  processing  industry  in  the  RMI\nand the direct link between the loining plant and the fishing industry,\nit could be useful to identify it as a fisheries activity and classify it in\nthe national accounts as a separate sub-industry under \u201cManufactur-\ning.\u201d Given that the loining operation is not classified under \u201cFishing,\u201d\nits  contribution  to  GDP  has  not  been  included  in  the  consultants\u2019\nrevised estimate of GDP.\n\nAlso,  a  considerable  amount  of  fish  is  transshipped  from  for-\neign  vessels  in  the  RMI.  Transshipment  is  not  a  fishing  activity  and\nthe  value  added  accruing  from  the  activity  is  correctly  allocated  to\nother sectors of the economy including \u201cTransport,\u201d \u201cWholesale and\nRetail,\u201d  and  \u201cHotels.\u201d\n\nRevised  Estimates  of  GDP\n\nLarge-scale  fishing:\n\n\u2014nil\u2014\n\nSource  of  data:  Production  and  price  information  as  per  Appendix  2.\nIncludes  foreign-owned  offshore  fishing,  where  the  operation  is  based  in\nthe  RMI.

While  this  figure  is  markedly  higher  than  the  offi-\ncial estimate, it is noted that methods used by Statistics New Zealand\nare  valid  and  appropriate.  The  principal  difference  is  in  the  value\nattributed to the coastal commercial fishing. The consultants have used\na  production  approach  and  with  a  markedly  higher  average  price\nthan that applicable to the  coastal subsistence  subsector.  It  is  possible\nthat  the  income  tax  data  used  to  make  the  official  estimates  were\nincomplete  or  understated.\n\nBackground\n\nThe  Niue  GDP  for  the  years  1997\u20132000  are  calculated  by\nStatistics  New  Zealand  in  2000  (Lewington  2000). A  combination  of\nproduction and income approaches is used, and the results are cate-\ngorized  by  ownership  and  industry  group.  Statistics  New  Zealand\nwas  thorough  and  took  particular  account  of  the  role  and  impor-\ntance of fishing in Niue.\n\nThe published national accounts are highly aggregated with fish-\ning  being  included  in  the  \u201cAgriculture,  Hunting,  Fishing  and  For-\nestry\u201d sector of the industry group and \u201cPrivate Sector Subsistence\u201d\nof  the  ownership  group.\n\nThe  insignificant  amount  of  on-shore  handling  or  processing  is\ndistributed  through  several  sectors  in  the  industry  group  and  the\n\u201cPrivate  Enterprises  in  the  Formal  Cash\u201d  sector  of  the  ownership\ngroup. Given the small amount of added value that would be attrib-\nutable to the nonfishing fisheries activities, it is not worth the effort\nrequired  to  undertake  a  separate  analysis.\n\nMethods  used  to  Calculate  Contribution  to  GDP\n\nThe fishing sector is divided in two subsectors:\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\nCoastal  Subsistence  Fishing.  This  includes  subsistence  and\nnonmarket  production.\nCoastal Commercial Fishing. This includes small-scale commer-\ncial fishing and some sport fishing.\n\nThe valuation of the coastal subsistence fishing component of GDP\nis based upon a survey of 20 households (3.6% of all households in\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n100\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nAppendix 1\n\n101\n101\n\nNiue) that was carried out in June 2000. The results from the survey\nwere  extrapolated  by  the  population  to  estimate  the  overall  con-\nsumption.  This  survey  indicated  that  the  annual  catch  from\nsubsistence  fisheries  was  194  mt.  The  price  of  each  fishery  product\nin  the  diet  was  gathered  from  the  local  market,  and  the  calculated\ngross value of output was NZ$315,640. Gross value was discounted\nby  20\u201330%  to  arrive  at  a  \u201cfarm  gate\u201d  price.  The  \u201cfarm  gate\u201d  value\nwas  then  multiplied  by  0.65  to  arrive  at  the  value  added  by  the\nsubsector.\n\nThe  data  used  to  value  the  coastal  commercial  fishing  subsector\nwere derived from income tax returns. The few businesses engaged\nin  fishing  also  provide  fishing  charters. Income  from  tourism  is  in-\ncluded in the estimate since it is not possible to separate the income\nand costs of the tourists operation from the purely fishing income.\n\nComments on the GDP Calculation\n\nAs  stated  in  the  supporting  documentation  (Lewington  2000):\n\nThe methods used to measure the subsistence economy are spelt out\nin some detail. Subjective judgment played a major part in these esti-\nmates. Users of these National Accounts need to be aware of the as-\nsumptions and may wish to adjust them in accordance with their\nown view on subsistence consumption and its valuation.\n\nGiven the inherent uncertainties in the process, the assumptions\n\nused  appear  reasonable.\n\nThe  official  estimate  of  annual  subsistence  catch  of  194  mt  is\nsomewhat  higher  than  that  reported  by  (i)  Dalzell  et  al.  (1996)  sub-\nsistence  estimate  of  103  mt;  and  (ii)  the  estimate  of  120  mt  for  all\nNiue fisheries used by the Niue Department of Agriculture, Forestry\nand  Fisheries  (B.  Pasisi,  pers.  com.  June  2001).\n\nThe  income  method  used  to  calculate  the  contribution  from\ncoastal commercial fishing is valid given that the analyst had access\nto income tax records. This approach relies upon the accuracy of the\nincome  tax  records.  There  is  a  risk  that  the  production  estimate  for\ncoastal  subsistence  fishing  might  double  count  the  coastal  commer-\ncial  catch.  This  could  happen  if  the  household  consumption  data\nused to calculate the coastal subsistence production include the fish\npurchased  from  commercial  operators.  It  is  noted  that,  given  the\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n101\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f102\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\nrelatively small contribution attributed to the commercial subsector,\nany  double  counting  is  probably  not  significant.\n\nRevised  Estimates  of  GDP\n\nCoastal  subsistence  fishing:\n\n194  mt\n\n*\n\nNZ$1,650\n\n*\n\n0.65 = NZ$208,065\n\nSource  of  data:  Production  and  price  information  as  per  Appendix  2.  The\nprice  estimates  assume  that  the  catch  includes  a  significant  proportion  of\nshellfish  and  other  relatively  low  value  species.  While  the  subsistence  fish-\ning  includes  low  input  reef  gleaning  and  nonmotorized  fishing,  a  relatively\nhigh  proportion  of  the  fishing  is  high  input  motorized  trolling.  In  the  circum-\nstances, the value-added ratio is lower than would usually be expected for a\nsubsistence  fishery.\n\nCoastal  commercial  fishing:\n\n12  mt\n\n*\n\nNZ$8,000\n\n*\n\n0.60 =\n\nNZ$57,600\n\nSource  of  data:  Production  information  as  per  Appendix  2.

In subsequent years, the Economic and Social Commis-\nsion for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), IMF, UNDP, and the Office of\nPlanning  and  Statistics  have  each  prepared  GDP  estimates.  The\nmethods  and  approaches  used  have  varied,  sometimes  markedly.\nOne consequence of these differences has been the wide variation in\nestimates  of  the  contribution  of  fishing  to  the  Palau  economy.  The\nestimates  range  from  a  high  of  28.8%  in  1992  (from  a  development\nplan  cited  in  Lambeth  [1999]  and  Bishop  et  al.  [1995])  to  a  low  of\n2.7%  in  1998  (Office  of  Planning  and  Statistics  2000c).\n\nIn the circumstance, it would be unwise to give much credence\nto  inter-temporal  comparisons  of  fisheries  contribution  to  GDP  in\nPalau.\n\nMethods  used  to  Calculate  Contribution  to  GDP\n\nUnlike the situation for most Pacific Island countries where fish-\ning  is  combined  with  agriculture  and  other  primary  industries,  the\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n103\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f104\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\nnational  accounts  prepared  by  the  Office  of  Planning  and  Statistics\nshow \u201cFisheries\u201d as a separate sector. In the case of Palau, the term\n\u201cFisheries\u201d  is  taken  to  be  analogous  to  \u201cFishing\u201d  as  defined  in  the\nSNA.\n\nIn  calculating  the  contribution  of  fishing  to  GDP,  the  Office  of\n\nPlanning  and  Statistics  divided  the  sector  into  three  categories:\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\nCorporate  Sector  (of  which  offshore  and  large-scale  commer-\ncial  fishing  is  a  component).  The  Office  of  Planning  and  Statis-\ntics used a combination of income and expenditure approaches\nto  value  the  fisheries  component  of  the  corporate  sector.  The\ndata  used  were  collected  directly  from  the  larger  fishing  com-\npanies.\nSmall-scale  Commercial  Fishing.  Wage  information  obtained\nfrom the social security register was used to calculate the value\nadded  to  GDP  by  small-scale  commercial  fishing.\nSubsistence Fishing. The contribution of subsistence fishing has\nbeen calculated by multiplying the number of people who iden-\ntified themselves as fishers in the national census by the amount\nof  US$2,000.\n\nComments on the GDP Calculation\n\nThe approach used to calculate the contribution of the corporate\nsector  works  well  in  situations  where  the  enterprises  keep  accurate\nrecords,  and  it  is  possible  to  identify  and  survey  the  enterprises  in-\nvolved  in  fishing.  The  reason  for  the  substantial  difference  between\nthe  consultants\u2019  estimate  and  the  official  estimate  is  not  clear.\n\nThe methods used to calculate the contribution of both the small-\nscale commercial fishing and subsistence fishing are probably less accu-\nrate. It is unlikely that wages recorded in the social security register\naccount  for  all  the  value  added  to  GDP  by  small-scale  commercial\nfishing. A significant proportion of the payments to crew is probably\nin cash and, therefore, not recorded in the register. In addition, when\nusing the income approach to calculate the value added to GDP, the\ncalculation  should  include  employee  remuneration  (wages),  operat-\ning  surplus  and  the  consumption  of  fixed  capital.\n\nThe  estimated  contribution  of  the  subsistence  fishing  category\nis  based  on  what  appears  to  be  an  arbitrary  value  per  capita  of\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n104\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nAppendix 1\n\n105\n105\n\nUS$2,000  for  each  fisher  (as  identified  in  the  census).  The  empirical\nbasis for the US$2,000 is not clear, although it is noted that the con-\ntribution  to  GDP  calculated  using  this  approach  is  close  to  that  cal-\nculated  by  the  consultants  using  the  production  approach.\n\nGiven  that  production  data  are  available  for  the  Palau  inshore\nand  offshore  fisheries  (Palau  Conservation  Society  [PCS]  2000  and\nexport  permits)  and  the  fact  that  domestic  and  export  prices  are\nreasonably well documented, a production approach is likely to pro-\nduce  a  more  reliable  measure  of  fisheries  contribution  to  GDP  for\nthe  small-scale  commercial  and  subsistence  fisheries.\n\nRevised  Estimates  of  GDP\n\nCorporate  sector:\n\n2,500  mt\n\n*\n\nUS$6,080\n\n*\n\n0.50 = US$7,600,000\n\nSource  of  data: Production  and  price  information  as  per  Appendix  2.  The\nvalue-added ratio of 0.50 is derived from consultations with an SPC master\nfisherman and the analysis of various reports in which income and expendi-\nture  records  for  commercial  vessels  are  detailed.\n\nThere are marked swings in the level of corporate fishing activ-\nity between years. Up to 600 foreign longline boats have been based\nin  Palau  at  times  during  the  1990s;  while  in  other  years  there  has\nbeen  virtually  no  locally-based  foreign  vessels.  The  production  of\nthese  foreign-owned  vessels  should  be  included  in  the  contribution\nto  GDP  when  they  are  operating  in  conjunction  with  a  local  com-\npany  or  are  based  in  Palau  for  at  least  12  months.\n\nSmall-scale  commercial  fishing:\n\n865  mt\n\n*\n\nUS$3,000\n\n*\n\n0.55 = US$1,427,250\n\nSource  of  data: Production  based  on  PCS  (2000).

The  consultants\u2019  estimate  is  two-and-a-\nhalf times greater than the official estimate. This difference is mainly\nattributable to the absence of the value added by subsistence fishing\nin  the  official  estimates.\n\nBackground\n\nThe  published  GDP  estimates  for  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG)\nare prepared by the NSO. According to NSO officials, GDP estimates\nare  also  prepared  by  the  Department  of  National  Planning,  Trea-\nsury,  and  the  Central  Bank  of  PNG.\n\nMethods  used  to  Calculate  Contribution  to  GDP\n\nNSO  officials  advised  the  consultants  that  they  do  not  have\ninformation  necessary  to  calculate  the  contribution  of  nonmarket\nfishing  production  to  GDP.  Hence,  there  is  no  value  given  to\nnonmarket  fishing  in  the  published  estimates  of  GDP.\n\nThe  consultants  were  also  advised  by  NSO  that  efforts  to  esti-\nmate the contribution of market fishing have been hampered by the\nlack of cooperation from the industry. Attempts to obtain data directly\nfrom  the  industry  were  suspended  due  to  the  poor  response  of  the\nindustry  to  the  requests  for  information.\n\nThe NSO currently uses data obtained from the Central Bank of\nPNG\u2019s  quarterly  survey  of  exports. According  to  NSO,  it  is  using  a\nmethod developed by an officer who has since left the organization,\nwhere  (i)  domestic  consumption  is  estimated  from  the  export  infor-\nmation, and (ii) a deflator is used to directly estimate the real contri-\nbution  of  fisheries  to  GDP,  from  which  the  nominal  contribution  is\ncalculated.\n\nComments on the GDP Calculation\n\nThe  complete  absence  of  nonmarket  production  fishing  in  the\npublished  figures  significantly  understates  the  contribution  of  the\nfishing sector to GDP. If the value of the estimated 26,000 mt of sub-\nsistence  catch  (see  below)  is  included  in  the  estimates,  the  fishing\ncontribution  to  national  GDP  almost  doubles.\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n107\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f108\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\nThe information obtained by the consultants is not sufficient to\nenable  an  evaluation  of  the  method(s)  being  used  to  determine  the\ncontribution of market fishing. Suffice it to say that, if the method is\nas  described,  it  is  difficult  to  envisage  how  export  data  for  a  few\ninternationally  traded  products  can  be  extrapolated  to  generate  a\nreasonably  accurate  estimate  of  the  contribution  of  all  market  fish-\ning to GDP.\n\nRevised  Estimates  of  GDP\n\nSubsistence  fishing:\n\n26,000  mt\n\n*\n\nK2,000\n\n*\n\n0.90 =\n\nK46,800,000\n\nSource of data: Production and price information as per Appendix 2.

The consultants\u2019 estimate is about\nST18  million  (or  28%)  lower  than  the  official  estimate.\n\nBackground\n\nThe  Samoa  GDP  estimates  are  calculated  by  the  Treasury  De-\npartment  in  consultation  with  the  Bureau  of  Statistics  and  the  Cen-\ntral  Bank.\n\nMethods  used  to  Calculate  Contribution  to  GDP\n\nThe  fishing  component  of  the  GDP  is  divided  into  two  sub-\ncategories:  monetary  and  nonmonetary.  There  is  also  the  fisheries-\nrelated  category  of  monetary  fishing:  commerce.\n\nThe composition of the sub-categories is as follows:\n\n(cid:127) Monetary  Fishing.  This  refers  to  offshore  fishing.\n(cid:127) Non-Monetary  Fishing.  This  includes  subsistence,  nonmarket\nhousehold  production,  and  small-scale  commercial  fishing.\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n109\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f110\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\n(cid:127) Monetary  fishing:  commerce.  This  refers  to  fisheries-related\nactivities  such  as  onshore  fish  handling,  packaging,  and  trans-\nshipment.\n\nThe  valuation  of  the  contribution  of  the  monetary  fishing  sector\nuses  a  production  approach.  The  contribution  to  GDP  is  calculated\nby deducting the intermediate costs from the gross output, which is\nthe product of the total production multiplied by the average price.\nSince  most  of  the  catch/production  from  this  sector  ends  up  being\nexported,  principally  to  the  canneries  in  Pago  Pago,  it  is  relatively\neasy  to  measure  the  volume  produced  and  the  market  price.  The\nestimate  of  costs  of  intermediate  inputs  is  also  reasonably  straight-\nforward given the data available on the cost of operating commercial\nfishing  vessels,  and  the  costs  of  handling,  packaging  and  shipping\nin  Samoa.\n\nThe measure of the value added contribution of the nonmonetary\nfishing sector is based on data collected in a study of the sector that\nwas  carried  out  in  2000  (Passfield  2001).  That  study  produced  esti-\nmates  of  the  quantity  of  fish  caught  and  consumed  by  households,\nand those caught and sold by small-scale commercial fishers. It also\nprovided an estimate of the market value of the product. The results\nof this study have been incorporated into the 2000 national accounts\nand for some earlier years.\n\nPassfield  estimated  village  fisheries  production  to  be  7,169  mt\nper  annum,  which  comprises  4,293  mt  used  for  home  consumption\nand  2,879  mt  sold  or  given  away.  The  small-scale  commercial  fish-\ning activity is encompassed within village production. Passfield also\nestimated  the  weighted  average  market  price  of  small-scale  com-\nmercial fisheries production to be ST6.29 per kg. This approach val-\nues home consumption at the market price of the fish. The approach\nis  inconsistent  with  the  SNA  scheme  of  valuing  goods  and  services\nthat are consumed by the producer instead of being sold. According\nto  the  SNA,  the  \u201cfarm  gate\u201d  price  is  more  appropriate.\n\nAccording  to  SNA,  the  category  monetary  fishing:  commerce    is\nnot within the sector in SNA known as \u201cfishing,\u201d but it is obviously\nrelated to fisheries.  The contribution of the category is slightly more\ndifficult to estimate. The enterprises engaged in this sector vary con-\nsiderably in size and sophistication making it more difficult to mea-\nsure  their  production,  prices,  and  intermediate  costs.  The  Treasury\nDepartment  faces  similar  difficulties  in  measuring  the  contribution\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n110\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nAppendix 1\n\n111\n111\n\nof most other sectors in the economy. It has, therefore, elected to use\na  variation  of  the  expenditure  approach  to  valuation.  Samoa  has  a\nvalue-added  tax  (VAT),  and  all  enterprises  with  an  annual  gross\nturnover exceeding ST52,000 are obliged to submit two monthly VAT\nreturns.  Enterprises  are  classified  by  sector,  and  the  VAT  payments\nfor  each  sector  summed  up.  It  is  then  possible  to  back  calculate  the\nvalue added by each sector by dividing the total VAT collected from\nthe  sector  by  the  VAT  rate.  Virtually  all  the  enterprises  in  this  cat-\negory  are  obliged  to  submit  VAT  returns  and  business  activity\nreports,  so  the  coverage  is  quite  good.  The  procedure  also  has  the\nadvantage  of  relying  on  a  legally  enforceable  obligation  that  is  im-\nposed on all enterprises.\n\nComments on the GDP Calculation\n\nThe  production  approach  that  was  used  to  measure  the  contri-\nbution of monetary fishing is the best available method given the com-\nplex nature of the sector. The fishing sector is notoriously difficult to\nmeasure  because:\n\n(i) There  is  a  usually  a  wide  range  in  the  size  of  the  enterprises\n\ninvolved;\n\n(ii) Many  participants  are  owner-operators  who  sell  their  catch\n\nfor  cash  and  do  not  report  their  earnings;\n\n(iii) Even when crew are employed, they often work for a \u201cshare of\nthe catch,\u201d the amount of which can vary markedly depending\nupon  the  amount  they  contribute  to  the  operating  costs.\n\nIn  the  circumstances,  the  income  or  expenditure  approaches  to\nthe  valuation  of  GDP  are  not  usually  feasible.  Their  coverage  is  in-\ncomplete and, even where an enterprise is covered, the valuation of\noutput  is  difficult.  A  production  approach  that  relies  on  secondary\ndata  sources  such  as  shipping  records,  international  prices,  and\nmarket surveys is likely to produce more reliable data.\n\nThe  procedure  used  to  measure  the  nonmonetary  fishing  contri-\nbution to GDP is appropriate. The only additional points worth con-\nsidering  are:\n\n(i)\n\nThe  segregation  of  small-scale  commercial  fishing  from  the\nsubsistence  component  of  village  fishing.  The  Passfield  re-\nport  identifies  the  share  of  village  production  going  to  own\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n111\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f112\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\nconsumption  and  the  share  that  is  sold  or  given  away.  This\ndistinction could be used as the boundary between subsistence\nfishing  and  small-scale  commercial  fishing.\n\n(ii) Given  that  much  of  the  subsistence  production  is  from  glean-\ning the reef and inshore fishing while much of the small-scale\ncommercial  fishing  uses  boats  many  of  which  have  motors,\nthere  is  a  marked  difference  in  the  level  of  intermediate  costs\nbetween  the  two  activities.  Splitting  the  village  fisheries  into\ntwo sub-categories\u2014subsistence and small-scale commercial\u2014\nwould  enable  a  more  accurate  calculation  of  value  added.\n(iii) The  price  used  to  value  nonmonetary  production  is  the  esti-\nmated weighted average market price of total production. It is\nworth  considering  to  use  a  farm  gate  price  for  own  consump-\ntion  given  that  the  value  to  the  household  is  the  market  price\nless  the  cost  of  transport  and  marketing.\n\nThe  monetary  fishing:  commerce  subsector  mainly  comprises  the\nmedium to large enterprises involved in the onshore handling, pack-\ning,  and  shipping  of  fish  for  export.  In  most  national  accounts,  the\nvalue  added  from  these  activities  is  usually  distributed  between  a\nnumber of other sectors including food processing, transport, whole-\nsale  and  retail.  The  decision  to  show  these  separately  provides  a\nbetter  insight  into  the  importance  of  fishing  and  fisheries  to  the\neconomy  of  Samoa.\n\nThe use of VAT returns and business activity returns to measure\nthe  contribution  of  these  enterprises  can  be  an  effective  method  of\nmeasuring  their  contribution  to  GDP.  However,  this  method  is  only\nfeasible  where  VAT  or  a  similar  consumption  tax  is  imposed  and\nwhere  business  activity  returns  are  collected  and  analyzed.  The  ef-\nfectiveness of the method relies on a thorough coverage of the enter-\nprises operating in the sector. This may not always be the case, espe-\ncially given that small enterprises may not be obliged to submit VAT\nreturns.  In  the  case  of  Samoa,  it  seems  that  most  of  the  commercial\noperators  are  submitting  returns.  So  the  method  provides  an  effec-\ntive way of measuring the value added of the subsector.\n\nRevised  Estimates  of  GDP\n\nMonetary tuna fishing:\n\n5,156  mt\n\n*\n\nST5,769\n\n*\n\n0.50 = ST14,872,482\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n112\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nAppendix 1\n\n113\n113\n\nSource of data: Production and price information as per Appendix 2.\nProduction: 5,156 mt total tuna catch of Alia catamaran longline fleet in 1999\nas reported by Watt and Moala (2000), Watt (2001), Sua and Watt (2001).\nPrice: Weighted average of tuna shipped to Pago Pago canneries (3,370 mt\n*  ST5,400/mt  FOB)  and  tuna  airfreighted  for  the  sashimi  market  (1,037mt  *\nST9,000/mt)  and  local  sales/gifts  (749  mt  *  ST2.96/mt).\n\nSubsistence  fishing:\n\n4,293  mt\n\n*\n\nST5,030\n\n*\n\n0.90 =\n\nST19,434,411\n\nSource of data: Production and price information as per Appendix 2.\n\nSmall-scale  commercial  fishing:\n\n3,086  mt\n\n*\n\nST6,448\n\n*\n\n0.60 =\n\nST11,939,117\n\nSource of data: Production and price information as per Appendix 2.\n\nMonetary  fishing: commerce:\n\n(no  independent  estimate)  =  ST18,858,000\n\nAlthough  the  Samoan  authorities  explicitly  recognize  the  importance  of  the\ncommercial  activities  associated  with  fishing  by  estimating  its  contribution\nseparately from other commerce activities, these activities are not part of the\n\u201cfishing\u201d sector and are not included in the table below.\n\nThis  can  be  summarized  and  compared  to  the  official  estimate:\n\nTable  A1.20: Official  vs.  Re-estimates  of  GDP  and\nFishing  Contribution  of  Samoa,  1999\n(ST)\n\nItem\n\nGDP  (current  market  prices)\nFishing  Contribution  to  GDP\n\nOfficial GDP\n Estimate\n\n705,914,000\n56,399,000\n\nConsultants Revised\nEstimate\n\n695,763,630\n46,246,010\n\nGDP = gross domestic product; ST = tala.\nSources:  Treasury  Department  (2000);  Consultants\u2019  estimates.\n\nSolomon Islands\n\nThe Nominal Contribution of Fishing to GDP\n\nThe  following  tables  present  three  separate  series  of  GDP  esti-\n\nmates  including:\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n113\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f114\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\n(i)\n\nthe  Bank  of  Hawaii\u2019s  (BoH)  estimates  of  nominal  GDP  from\n1993  to  1997  (BoH  1998);\n\n(ii) ADB\u2019s  estimates  of  real  GDP  from  1993  to  1999  (ADB  2000b);\n\n(iii)\n\nand\nthe  Central  Bank  of  the  Solomon  Islands  (CBSI)  estimate  of\nfishing  contribution  to  GDP  (CBSI  2000).\n\nTable  A1.21: Bank  of  Hawaii\u2019s  Estimates  of  Nominal  GDP\nof  Solomon  Islands,  1993\u20131997\n(SI$\u2019000)\n\nItem\n\n1993\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1997\n\nGDP (current market prices)\n\n755,300\n\n879,300\n\n1,059,300 1,225,800 1,352,700\n\nGDP = gross domestic product; SI$ = Solomon Islands dollar.\nSource: Bank of Hawaii, 1998.\n\nTable  A1.22: ADB\u2019s  Estimates  of  Real  GDP  and\nFishing  Contribution  of  Solomon  Islands,  1993\u20131999\n(US$)\n\nItem\n\n1993\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1997\n\n1998\n\n1999\n\nReal  GDP\n(1985  prices)\n\nMonetary  Fishing\nContribution\n\nMonetary  Fishing\nContribution  (%)\n\nNonmonetary  Food\nContribution  a\n\n268,800 282,800 301,700 312,300 309,200 302,400 305,400\n\n13,800\n\n17,400\n\n24,200\n\n\u2014\n\n5.1\n\n6.2\n\n8.0\n\n\u2014\n\n41,400\n\n42,500\n\n43,600\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank; GDP = gross domestic product; SI$ = Solomon Islands dollar.\na  Nonmonetary  fishing  is  included  in  the  non-monetary  food  category;  the  disaggregated  contribution\nof  nonmonetary  fishing  is  not  available.

It is expected that, if the problems can be resolved, all or part\nof this activity will resume.\n\nMethods  used  to  Calculate  Contribution  to  GDP\n\nThe method and data used to calculate the estimates in the pre-\n\nceding  tables  were  not  available.\n\nComments on the GDP Calculation\n\nOverall, it is difficult to give a high degree of credence to any of\nthe estimates in the foregoing tables. In all cases, analysts have very\nlittle  information  available  to  them  and  the  data  that  are  available\nare of doubtful quality.\n\nInformation on the process of estimation of GDP for the Solomon\nIslands was not available for this study due principally to the unrest\nin Honiara. However, the Central Bank\u2019s Economic Section indicated\nthat (i) the nonmonetary contribution to GDP was extrapolated from\nearlier  figures  using  population  growth,  and  (ii)  the  monetary  fish-\ning contribution \u201cwas not calculated but rather a figure used by the\nStatistics  Office  is  adjusted.\u201d\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n115\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f116\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\nThe  Bank  of  Hawaii  Solomon  Islands  Economic  Report  (BoH\n1998)  indicates  \u201cthere  are  no  consistent  economic  data  on  compo-\nnents of GDP by industry, employment, wages, and other payments.\u201d\nOf particular concern is the substantial difference between ADB\nand  CBSI  estimates  of  the  contribution  of  monetary  fishing  to  GDP.\nThis is especially so given that both series are purportedly using the\nsame base year. It is noted that the CBSI publication does not specify\nthe units of measurement. In normal circumstances, the series would\nbe  reported  in  local  currency.  However,  the  marked  difference\nbetween ADB  and  CBSI  series  suggests  that  it  would  be  unwise  to\nmake  this  assumption.\n\nAn  IMF  publication  on  the  Solomon  Islands  national  accounts\n\n(IMF  1994)  makes  some  observations  and  recommendations:\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\nThe  national  accounts  and  some  of  the  major  economic  indica-\ntors for the Solomon Islands have deteriorated in timeliness and\ncoverage  in  recent  years.\nThere are no acceptable indicators readily available from which\nto  estimate  private  sector  operating  surplus.\nThe food component of the \u201cnonmonetary production\u201d category\nis  based  on  a  nutritional  survey  in  PNG  [sic]  combined  with  a\nhousehold  income  and  expenditure  survey  done  in  1982  in  the\nSolomon  Islands.\n\nIt appears that the quality of the national accounts has declined\n\nconsiderably  since  the  IMF  comments  were  made.\n\nRevised  Estimates  of  GDP\n\nSmall-scale  commercial  fishing:\n\n3,200  mt\n\n*\n\nSI$2,875\n\n*\n\n0.65 =\n\nSI$5,980,000\n\nSource of data: Production and price information as per Appendix 2.

The  consultants\u2019  estimate  is\nhigher  than  the  official  estimate  by  about  5.0%.\n\nSubsequent  to  preparing  this  analysis,  the  consultants  were\nadvised that the GDP estimates for Tonga had been re-estimated. In\nthe  re-estimates,  the  fishing  contribution  has  been  reduced  to\nT$16,915,600.  Perusal  of  the  data  shows  that  the  principal  differ-\nence  between  the  consultants\u2019  estimate  and  the  new  estimate  pre-\npared by the Statistics Department is in the value added by exports.\nIn  their  re-estimation  of  the  fishing  contribution,  the  Department\ncontinues  to  rely  upon  official  export  statistics. As  discussed  else-\nwhere  in  this  report,  the  consultants  believe  that  the  official  export\nstatistics  understate  the  gross  value  of  exports.\n\nBackground\n\nThe  Statistics  Department  has  published  provisional  estimates\nof  Tonga\u2019s  GDP  for  the  financial  years  from  1993/94  to  1999/00\n(Statistics  Department  2000a).  Officials  of  the  Statistics  Department\nalso  provided  the  consultants  with  a  photocopied  worksheet  that\nshows  the  breakdown  of Agriculture/Forestry/Fisheries  sector  into\nits  component  parts.  This  breakdown  shows  the  contribution  of  the\nlocally  marketed,  nonmarketed,  and  exports  subsectors  to  GDP  for\n1999/00.  The  contributions  are  as  follows:  T$9,090,000  for  locally\nmarketed;  T$5,108,000  for  nonmarketed;  and  T$3,701,000  for  fish\nexports.\n\nMethods  used  to  Calculate  Contribution  to  GDP\n\nThe  categories  used  by  the  Statistics  Department  are:\n\n(cid:127)\n\nLocally Marketed. This category covers the fish that are caught\nfor sale as food. The Statistics Department indicated that a pro-\nduction  approach  is  used  to  estimate  the  value  added  by  the\nlocally  marketed  subsector.  The  initial  data  were  obtained  by\nsurveying  some  private  businesses.  This  value  is  updated  by\nextrapolation based on population, consumer price index (CPI),\nand  disaster  index.  Twenty  percent  of  the  gross  value  is  sub-\ntracted  to  cover  intermediate  costs.\n\n(cid:127) Nonmarketed.  This  category  covers  the  fish  and  aquatic  prod-\nucts  that  are  harvested  for  household  use.  The  value  added  is\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n118\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nAppendix 1\n\n119\n119\n\nimputed  from  information  obtained  in  a  1993/94  HIES.  In  the\nyears since the HIES, the estimated GDP contributions have been\nderived by extrapolation based on population, CPI, and disaster\nindex. As with the locally marketed fish, 20% is deducted from\nthe  gross  output  to  cover  intermediate  costs.\nExport.  The  export  contribution  to  estimated  GDP  comes  from\nthe  Reserve  Bank  exports  statistics.  According  to  the  Statistics\nDepartment,  the  total  value  of  fisheries  exports  is  reduced  by\n35%  to  account  for  costs  of  intermediate  inputs.\n\n(cid:127)\n\nThe  Statistics  Department  also  advised  that  there  is  very  little\nfish processing carried out in Tonga and to the extent that the fish is\nprocessed before consumption, sale or export, the added value would\nbe  incorporated  in  the  above  three  subsectors.\n\nComments on the GDP Calculation\n\nThe estimate of the nonmarket contribution to GDP relies on the\nextrapolation  of  data  collected  almost  a  decade  ago.  In  addition,\nthe  results  of  the  survey  have  not  been  published  so  it  is  difficult\nto  crosscheck  the  accuracy  of  the  base  data  against  other  data\nsources.\n\nThe  accuracy  of  the  factors  used  to  adjust  for  the  cost  of  inter-\nmediate inputs could be improved with some input from the fishing\nsector.  The  figures  used  for  market  fishing  (20%)  and  export  (35%)\nappear  low,  while  the  nonmarket  factor  (20%)  appears  high.\n\nAdvice from the Tonga Fish Exporters Association indicates that\nthe value of exported fishery products is about three times that shown\nin  the  Reserve  Bank  reports  (Appendix  2).  The  export  data  used  by\nthe  Reserve  Bank  is  taken  from  packing  lists,  while  the  information\nfrom  the  exporter  association  is  based  on  the  audited  accounts  of\nthe major finfish exporters. The price used by the Reserve Bank in its\ncalculation  is  T$5.67  per  kg,  whereas  that  largest  exporter  indicates\nthat  they  receive  an  average  price  of  T$7.35  per  kg  free  on  board\n(FOB)  for  exports.  Closer  consultation  between  the  authorities  re-\nsponsible  for  the  preparation  of  the  estimates,  i.e.,  the  Ministry  of\nFisheries  and  the  industry,  could  help  improve  the  accuracy  of  the\nestimated  contribution  of  exports  to  GDP.\n\nIt is unclear whether \u201cfish\u201d exports encompass all living marine\nresources.  The  Ministry  of  Fishery Annual  Report\u2019s  estimate  of  ex-\nports  includes  shark  fins,  aquarium  fish  and  related  products,  and\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n119\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f120\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\nseaweed. These should be included in the estimated contribution of\nthe  sector  to  GDP.\n\nIt  appears  that  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  has  little  input  into  or\ninfluence  over  the  estimation  of  fishing  contribution  to  GDP.  Given\nthat  the  Ministry  has  access  to  a  wider  range  of  data  and  informa-\ntion  on  fishing  than  those  which  are  readily  available  to  the  Statis-\ntics  Department,  a  closer  liaison  between  the  two  organizations\nshould  improve  the  accuracy  of  the  estimates.\n\nRevised  Estimates  of  GDP\n\nSmall-scale  commercial:\n\nLocal  market\n\nBottomfish\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n3,561  mt\n\nT$3,190 *\n\n0.55 =\n\nT$6,247,775\n\n612  mt\n\nT$7,350\n\n0.60 =\n\nT$2,698,920\n\nAquarium  and  related  products\n\nT$1,5000,000\n\n0.80 =\n\nT$1,200,000\n\nSource  of  data: Production  and  price  information  as  per  Appendix  2.

They were prepared with the assistance of an economic con-\nsultant from Statistics New Zealand. The approach and assumptions\nused are outlined in the National Accounts 1996 to 1998 Report and\nthe  associated  Technical  Report  (Lewington  1999b).\n\nMethods  used  to  Calculate  Contribution  to  GDP\n\nThe contribution of \u201cFishing\u201d to GDP in current prices for 1998\nis  shown  as  A$66,000  and  A$1,426,200  for  market  and  nonmarket\nproduction,  respectively.\n\nTo  calculate  the  contribution  of  fishing  to  GDP,  the  analyst\ndivided  the  sector  into  two  principal  categories  and  three  sub-\ncategories:\n\n(cid:127) Market Production. This category covers the fish that are caught\nfor  sale  as  food.  The  calculation  assumes  that  the  government-\nowned fishing company, National Fishing Corporation of Tuvalu\n(NAFICOT),  catches  100%  of  the  fish  sold  commercially.  The\nvalue-added ratio of 0.55 used in the calculation is derived from\nNAFICOT  records.\n\n(cid:127) Nonmarket  Production.  Nonmarket  fishing  includes  three  sub-\n\ncategories:\n\n(i)\n\nSubsistence Fishing. The contribution of subsistence fishing\nis calculated from data on household fish consumption and\nmarket prices. The data distinguish between consumption\nrate and price levels in Funafuti and in the outer islands.\n\n\u2013 Funafuti:\n\n\u2013 Outer  islands:\n\nAverage daily household consumption\u20141.34 kg\nMarket  price\u2014A$2.20  per  kg\nValue-added  ratio\u20140.85\n\nAverage daily household consumption\u20141.14 kg\nMarket  price\u2014A$1.50  per  kg\nValue-added  ratio\u20140.90\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n122\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nAppendix 1\n\n123\n123\n\n(ii) Marine Products. Marine products include a range of items\ntaken for subsistence and used to produce handicrafts. The\ncalculation assumes that marine products add the equiva-\nlent  of  10%  of  the  sum  of  the  contribution  of  market  and\nsubsistence  to  GDP.\n\n(iii) Fish  Curing.  Fish  curing  is  an  activity  carried  out  in  the\nouter  islands  where  it  is  not  possible  to  refrigerate  fish.\nThe calculation used assumes that the amount of fish cured\nadds  the  equivalent  of  15%  of  the  contribution  of  subsis-\ntence  to  GDP.\n\nComments on the GDP Calculation\n\nThe  calculation  of  the  value  added  by  market  production  uses\nthe accounts of NAFICOT to provide values of gross output.  There\nis  very  little  information  available  on  the  quantity  of  fish  caught\nwithin  Tuvalu.  NAFICOT  has  information  on  fish  caught  from  its\nown  fishing  activities,  but  this  does  not  include  the  quantity  of  fish\ncaught by private fishers for commercial purposes. The value-added\nratio of 0.55 may be appropriate for the NAFICOT operation, but it\nseems  low  for  other  private  fishers,  many  of  whom  use  hand  lines\noff  the  reef  edge.  In  the  circumstances,  it  seems  likely  that  the  esti-\nmate  of  value  added  by  market  production  is  an  underestimate  of\nthe  contribution  to  GDP.\n\nThe  method  used  to  calculate  the  contribution  of  subsistence  is\nreasonable  given  the  data  available.  It  relies  upon  the  assumption\nthat  households  in  Tuvalu  consume  the  same  amount  of  fish  every\nyear  and  that  the  estimates  in  the  HIES  are  accurate.  The  consult-\nants  have  adopted  the  figures  used.\n\nThe  marine  products  subsector  includes  oysters,  seaweed,  crabs,\nlobsters, and seashells. Although the documentation does not specify\nthis, it is assumed that this subsector accounts for all the nonfinfish\ntaken  by  subsistence  fishing.  The  empirical  basis  for  the  10%  addi-\ntional  value  added  is  not  specified.  Since  these  products  normally\nconstitute  part  of  the  fish  catch,  they  are  probably  better  treated  as\npart  of  overall  subsistence  fishing  production.\n\nFish  curing  is  carried  out  in  the  outer  islands  where  the  people\ndo  not  have  access  to  refrigeration.  As  with  marine  products,  the\nempirical  basis  for  the  15%  additional  value  added  is  not  specified.\nA  conventional  production  approach  would  calculate  the  value\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n123\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f124\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\nadded  by  deducting  the  cost  of  intermediate  consumption  from  the\nfarm gate or market price of the cured product. Some data are avail-\nable  from  a  report  prepared  in  1996  (SCP  1997),  which  indicates\nthat the breakeven input cost of fish is close to the market price for\nfresh  fish.  Given  this  apparent  price  relationship  and  the  fact  that\nfish curing in Tuvalu is fundamentally a food security measure, it is\nreasonable  to  treat  the  fish  curing  as  part  of  overall  subsistence.\nCalculating  the  value  added  by  fish  curing  would  require  more\ndetailed information on the market price for cured fish and the vol-\nume  produced.\n\nThere  is  no  provision  in  the  accounts  for  nongovernment  com-\nmercial fishing. While small in context of the overall level of fishing\nactivity,  private  fishing  is  significant  and  should  be  included  in  the\nestimate  of  fishing  contribution  to  GDP.\n\nRevised  Estimates  of  GDP\n\nMarket  production:\n\n220  mt\n\n*\n\nA$2,000\n\n*\n\n0.65 =\n\nA$286,000\n\nSource  of  data: Production  and  price  information  as  per  Appendix  2.\nIncludes private fishing.

The\nvalue-added ratio is a weighted average of the NAFICOT value-added ratio\nused in the official calculations (0.55 * (54 mt/220 mt)) and the value-added\nratio for private fishers assumed by the consultants (0.75 * (166 mt/220 mt)).\n\nNonmarket  production:\n\n(cid:127)\n\nSubsistence\n\n880  mt\n\n*\n\nA$1,640 *\n\n0.88 =\n\nA$1,270,016\n\nSource of data: Production as per Appendix 2.

The value-added ratio of 0.88 is also a weighted average of the Funafuti\nvalue-added (0.40 * 0.85) and the outer islands (0.60 * 0.90). It assumes that\nmost of the subsistence catch is taken by a mix of gleaning and diving, with\nsome  being  taken  from  motorized  boats  (with  motorized  boats  being  more\ncommonly  used  in  Funafuti).\n\nThis  can  be  summarized  and  compared  to  the  official  estimate:\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n124\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nAppendix 1\n\n125\n125\n\nTable  A1.28:    Official  vs.  Re-estimates  of  GDP  and\nFishing  Contribution  of  Tuvalu,  1998\n(A$)\n\nItem\n\nOfficial GDP\n Estimate\n\nConsultants Revised\nGDP Estimate\n\nGDP  (current  market  prices)\n\n22,044,500\n\nFishing  Contribution  to  GDP\n\n1,492,200\n\n22,108,500\n\n1,556,016\n\nA$ = Australian dollar; GDP = gross domestic product.\nSources: Lewington  (1999a);  Consultants\u2019  estimates.\n\nVanuatu\n\nThe Nominal Contribution of Fishing to GDP\n\nTable  A1.29:    Official  GDP  and  Fishing  Contribution  of\nVanuatu,  1995\u20131999\n(vt  million)\n\nItem\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1997\n\n1998\n\n1999\n\nGDP  (current  market  prices)\nCommercial  Fishing\nSubsistence  Fishing\n\n25,550\n149\n216\n\n26,711\n114\n238\n\n27,565\n57\n265\n\n29,289\n37\n239\n\n29,206\n34\n244\n\nFishing  Contribution  to  GDP\n\nBy Value\nBy Share (%)\n\n365\n1.4\n\n352\n1.3\n\n322\n1.2\n\n276\n0.9\n\n278\n1.0\n\nGDP = gross domestic product; mn = million; Vt = vatu.\nSources: Ministry  of  Finance  (2000);  P.

(1996)  used  information  from  Smith  (1992a)  and  from\nthe  nutrition  literature  to  estimate  the  coastal  fisheries  production:\n\nSubsistence  fisheries:\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127) Commercial  fisheries:\n\n6,243  mt, US$11,237,400\n   637 mt, US$1,483,544\n\nStatistics  Unit  (1999)  showed  that  490  mt  of  fish  and  shellfish\nworth  about  US$1.2  million  was  \u201cpurchased  by  local  fishing  mar-\nkets\u201d  in  1997.\n\nThe  HIES  of  1998  showed  that  US$18,496,000  was  spent  by\nhouseholds in the FSM on fresh and frozen fish, the vast majority of\nwhich would come from small-scale commercial fishing. Using aver-\nage fish price information from the Statistics Unit (1999), this equates\nto  6,323  mt  of  purchased  fish.\n\nFisheries  Engineering  (1995)  carried  out  extensive  fieldwork  in\nPohnpei and estimated the total coastal fishery production of Pohnpei\nIsland  to  be  about  1,780  mt  (75%  reef/inshore,  25%  pelagic).

(2001) indicated that about 2,000 mt of tuna is cap-\ntured  by  small-scale  coastal  fisheries  in  the  FSM.    If  pelagic  catches\nrepresent 25% of the fish from small-scale fisheries (as suggested by\nthe  Fisheries  Engineering  study  and  by  individuals  knowledgeable\nin FSM fisheries), then the total catch from small-scale fisheries would\nbe  about  8,000  mt.\n\nIt  is  very  difficult  to  make  even  a  rough  approximation  of  the\nFSM  coastal  catch  of  fish  and  shellfish.  Considering  the  HIES  data\nand the Fisheries Engineering data, it appears that the Dalzell et al.\n(1996) estimate of commercial production was especially low. In view\nof  the  above  information  and  associated  likely  credibility,  a  crude\nindication  of  the  coastal  fisheries  production  would  be  10,000  mt,\nabout  half  subsistence  and  half  commercial.  At  US$2.90  per  kg  for\nthe  commercial  catch  and  US$2.00  per  kg  for  the  subsistence  catch\n(30%  value  reduction  being  an  allowance  for  getting  the  product  to\nmarket  [Lewington  2000]),  this  equates  to  US$24.5  million.\n\nFor  offshore  industrial  tuna  catches,  the  following  has  been  es-\n\ntimated in Gillett et al.

A  relatively  small  portion  of  this  is  ex-\nported.  The  offshore  locally  based  tuna  vessels  caught  2,499  mt  in\n1999, a relatively small portion of which is consumed in the FSM. If\nthe amount of coastal subsistence and commercial exports is roughly\nequivalent to the local consumption of the locally based tuna vessels,\nthen the annual per capita consumption of fisheries products is about\n87.0  kg.  The  HIES  indicates  a  retail  expenditure  of  US$4,429,000  on\ncanned  fish  in  1998,  which  roughly  equates  to  27.0  kg  of  whole\nweight  of  fish  per  capita  per  year.  Following  this  logic,  the  annual\nper  capita  consumption  of  fishery  products  (both  imported  and  lo-\ncal)  in  the  FSM  would  be  about  114.0  kg.  To  this  figure  must  be\nadded  any  fish  leakage  from  the  tuna  transshipment  operations.5\n\nExchange  Rates\n\nThe  FSM  uses  the  US  dollar  (US$)  as  currency.\n\n5 In  1999,  there  were  approximately  90,500  mt  of  tuna  transshipped  through  FSM  ports  by\npurse  seiners.\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n141\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\f142\n\nThe Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n\nFiji Islands\n\nEmployment\n\nThe  1996  Annual  Employment  Survey  has  recently  been  up-\ndated  with  1998  figures.

This  contention  is  based  on  discussions  with  indi-\nviduals  in  charge  of  the  Fisheries  Division  statistical  system  on  a\nprevious  review  of  that  system  and  on  recent  developments:\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\nThe Fisheries Division staff involved with the statistical system\nstates  that  there  is  good  coverage  of  the  12  municipal  markets\nin  Viti  Levu  and  Vanua  Levu.  In  addition  to  the  regular  sam-\npling survey, there are other methods (i.e., records kept by market\nmaster) to verify the data: (i) good coverage of the tuna exports,\n(ii)  the  coverage  of  the  \u201coutlets\u201d  is  of  lower  quality,  and  (iii)\nthere is no coverage of subsistence fisheries.\n\u201cOutlets,\u201d  which  include  all  places  where  food  is  sold  outside\nof  municipal  markets,  are  rapidly  changing.  According  to  the\nFisheries Division, they are covered monthly if there is available\nstaff.  Officials  of  the  Fisheries  Division  stated  that  outlets  are\nonly  covered  in  Viti  Levu  and  Vanua  Levu. All  catches  on  the\nother  78  inhabited  islands  in  the  Fiji  Islands  are  considered  to\nbe  entirely  subsistence.\nJ. Cook, in a 1986 review of the fisheries statistical system in the\nFiji  Islands  (Cook  1986),  indicated  that  (i)  the  emphasis  on  the\nmunicipal markets should be reduced and efforts on the outlets\nshould  be  increased,  and  (ii)  the  methodology  of  the  1979  sur-\nvey of subsistence fisheries is questionable.\nThe  Fisheries  Division  estimates  of  subsistence  catch  are  based\non  a  1979  small-scale  fishing  survey  which  covered  only  Viti\nLevu, and used the ability of a single respondent in each village\nto  recall  landings  over  the  previous  12  months.  For  the  past  22\nyears,  the  estimate  of  small-scale  production  for  all  of  the  Fiji\nIslands  (the  largest  component  of  the  domestic  catch)  has  been\nmade simply by adding 200 mt of fish to the questionable 1979\nfigure.  The  results  of  a  small-scale  fisheries  survey  in  1993\n(Rawlinson  et  al.  1993)  were  not  used  to  modify  the  1979  esti-\nmate.  Also,  the  results  of  the  1995  survey  of  the  Northern\nDistrict  were  not  written  up  nor  used  to  modify  the  1979  esti-\nmate.

A  total  of  500\u2013600\npeople therefore appear to be formally employed in the fishing sec-\ntor  in  Samoa.\n\nAn  indicator  of  the  total  amount  of  formal  employment  in\nSamoa  is  the  23,009  people  who  are  remitting  payments  to  the\nNational  Provident  Fund  in  1999.  The  above  estimate  of  500\u2013600\njobs  in  fisheries,  therefore,  represents  a  substantial  amount  of  the\nwage  paying  employment  in  the  country.\n\nUsing  a  broader  definition  of  fishing  employment,  the  1999\nAgriculture  census  (Department  of  Statistics  and  Ministry  of Agri-\nculture  2000)  reports  that:\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127) One  third  of  the  total  number  of  households  in  Samoa  were\nengaged  in  some  form  of  fishing  during  the  week  prior  to  the\ncensus (or an equivalent of 6,699 households engaged in fishing).\nThe  total  number  of  people  engaged  in  some  form  fishing\nduring the week prior to the census was 10,142, of which 8,722\n(86%)  were  males  while  1,420  (14%)  were  females.\n1%  of  the  households  had  members  who  were  employed  in\nfishing.\nThe disposal of the catch is as follows:\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n\u2013\n\nSeventy  percent  of  the  6,699  fishing  households  did  not\nsell  any  of  the  catch;\n\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65\n\n186\n\n7/4/02, 6:59 PM\n\n\fReferences\nAppendix 2\n\n187\n187\n\n\u2013\n\nOf  the  households  that  did  sell  some  of  their  catch,  about\n30%  sold  half  of  their  catch,  28%  sold  about  one  quarter,\n23%  sold  about  three  quarters,  and  19%  sold  all  their\ncatch.\n\nFrom the above information, it can be inferred that about 9% of\nall fishing households in Samoa sell at least half of their catch. If this\nratio  applies  equally  to  the  total  number  of  people  engaged  in  fish-\ning (10,142 people), then about 900 people could be considered com-\nmercially  oriented  fishers.
