people and economies of the Pacific in\na variety of ways, but the full value of these benefits is not reflected\nin the region\u2019s statistics.\nRecords may be maintained, but they are not complete, or accu-\nrate, or comparable. The research summarized in this report reaf-\nfirms the importance of this sector to the economies and societies of\nthe Pacific Island countries. The research reveals that the full value\nof fisheries is likely to have eluded statisticians, and therefore fisher-\nies authorities, government decision makers, and funding agencies.\nBut the value of fisheries has never escaped the fisher, fish trader,\nand fish processor. The difference in appreciation, between public\nand private individuals, must raise the question of whether fisheries\nare receiving adequate attention from the public sector\u2014including\nthe necessary management and protection, appropriate research,\ndevelopment, extension and training, and sufficient investment.\nADB will distribute this report as widely as possible to public\nsector fisheries management agencies, planning agencies, statistics\noffices, and to other interested parties. But it is my hope that this\npublication will be updated soon, in recognition of this sector\u2019s\ncontribution to the economies of the region.

In discussions with Forum Fisheries\nAgency (FFA) and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC),\nADB developed a concept for a study to improve the accuracy of the\nestimates of the contribution of fisheries to national economies. The\nWorld Bank agreed later to participate in this joint activity.\nThe objectives of the study\nThe  immediate objective of the study was to use available data\nto measure the economic contribution of fisheries to the economies\nof Pacific Island nations. It was recognized, however, that a thor-\nough quantification of the economic benefits of fisheries would re-\nquire more than a short intervention. Accordingly, the longer-term\nobjectives of the study were set as follows:\n(cid:127) To improve the accuracy of measuring the contribution of fish-\neries to national economies;\n(cid:127) To generate interest among government fisheries agencies in\nmeasuring the economic contribution of fisheries to national\neconomies; and\n(cid:127) To provide information that could eventually be used to\nquantify the benefits of the various fisheries management\noptions.\nThe target audience\nThe primary target audiences of this study are Pacific Island\nfisheries agency staff interested in economics and statistics agency\nstaff interested in fisheries.   In addition, the study is also intended\nfor economists and national accountants working in the Pacific\n52512_ADB_Fisheries_prelims_new.p65 19 7/4/02, 6:52 PM", "xx The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\nIsland region, and regional and international organizations with a\ngeneral interest on fisheries in the Pacific.\nThe scope of the study\nIt was decided that the study should initially focus on the\nfishing contribution to gross domestic product (GDP), including\nexamining the methods used by national authorities to calculate this\ncontribution, commenting on the validity of these methods, and pro-\nducing an independent estimation of the fishing contribution to  GDP.\nThe study also compiled  information on the specific economic ben-\nefits of fisheries, including contributions to employment, exports,\ngovernment revenue, and nutrition.\nNational accounts and GDP\nNational accounts are an accounting framework used to mea-\nsure economic activity in a country. Most of the countries in the Pa-\ncific publish national accounts. The method used in each country is\nbased on a standardized System of National Accounts (SNA) that\nwas originally introduced by the United Nations in 1953.  Typically,\ngovernments, international agencies and private corporations use\nnational accounts to monitor developments within an economy.

GDP measures the level of domestic economic activity, or\nthe economic activity that takes place within a country during a\nspecified period of time. GNI is the measure of national economic\nactivity, which includes domestic activity (GDP) plus the net return\nto the country from overseas investments and remittances.\n52512_ADB_Fisheries_prelims_new.p65 20 7/4/02, 6:52 PM", "References xxi\nExecutive Summary xxi\nApproaches to compiling national accounts\nThree different methods are used to compile the national\naccounts of a country: the production approach, the income\napproach, and the expenditure approach.\n(cid:127) The production approach views the economy from the perspec-\ntive of production. The approach measures the gross output of\neach producer then deducts the value of the goods and services\npurchased from other producers and used in the production\nprocess.\n(cid:127) The income approach measures the major components of value-\nadded: employee compensation (wages and other remunera-\ntion), operating surplus (company profits), and indirect taxes\nnet of subsidies. The sum of these components is the value-added\nto GDP.\n(cid:127) The expenditure approach is based on the final use of the output\nproduced. It sums the expenditures of the main participants in\nthe economy: government final consumption, private final con-\nsumption, gross capital formation, and net exports.\nValuation of subsistence production\nAn important aspect of the production approach is the calcula-\ntion of the value of production. This can be particularly difficult\nwhen it is necessary to estimate the value of subsistence production.\nWhile there are several methods that could be used to value  subsis-\ntence production in this report, \u201cfarm gate\u201d pricing  has been used.\nThis method uses the market price of the product less the cost of\ngetting that product to market.\nCategorizing fishing activity for national account compilation\nThe compilers of national accounts must strike a balance\nbetween their desire for accuracy and the limitations on the time\nand effort they can dedicate to collecting and analyzing data. In the\ncase of fishing, striking this balance means that they are usually lim-\nited to using generalized estimates of income or production.

Each\nof these three categories can be analyzed using the approach most\nappropriate for the particular category.\nValue-added ratio\nThe production approach to estimating the contribution of fish-\ning to GDP requires two basic sets of data: (i) value of gross output\nof fishing, and (ii) intermediate costs. It is usually convenient to ex-\npress the intermediate costs as a proportion of the gross output.  This\nratio is called the value-added ratio. In this report the value-added\nratios used range from 40% for some offshore fishing to 90% for\nnonmotorized subsistence fishing.\nOfficial data on the contribution of fishing to GDP\nAccording to current official data in Pacific Island countries,\nthe percentage contribution of fishing to GDP in 1999 (or latest prior\nyear available) ranges from 0.6% in Papua New Guinea (PNG) to\n12.0% in Kiribati.\nRe-estimation of the contribution of fishing to GDP\nGiven the complexity of the issues to be addressed and the large\ndifference in the accuracy of the official fishing estimates made in\nthe Pacific Island countries, it was important for the study to  re-\nestimate the fishing contribution to GDP  using a consistent method\nacross all countries. It was believed that, at the very least, these esti-\nmates would provide useful comparators for the compilers of na-\ntional accounts. In addition, it was anticipated that the review of\nthe different methods and approaches used in each country would\nprovide useful insights into the effectiveness of alternative approaches\nto national accounting.\n52512_ADB_Fisheries_prelims_new.p65 22 7/4/02, 6:52 PM", "References xxiii\nExecutive Summary xxiii\nComparison of official and re-estimates\nThe comparison between the official and the new estimates of\nfishing contribution to GDP is presented on Figure 1 below.

It is\nrecommended that, in these countries, the compilers of national\naccounts carefully examine and evaluate the data, the assumptions,\nand the methods used.\nThe accuracy of the estimate of fishing contribution to GDP could\nbe improved with a closer liaison between the fisheries and the sta-\ntistics agencies. The fisheries agencies are in a position to provide\ninformation on new developments, technical insight, and recent data,\nall of which could improve GDP estimates. This cooperation, how-\never, rarely occurs in Pacific Island countries. Because the fisheries\nagencies have a vested interest in assuring that the importance of\ntheir sector is not underestimated, they should take the lead in\nimproving the liaison between their agency and the compilers of\nnational accounts.\nOne of the factors that often result in an underestimation of\nfisheries  contribution to national economies  is the limited informa-\ntion available on the production of small-scale fisheries. Throughout\nmost of the region, the statistics on  small-scale fisheries are incom-\nplete, inaccurate and, in some cases, absent. Given this reality, it is\nrecommended that maximum use be made of survey opportunities\noutside the fisheries sector.  At little cost, production information on\nsmall-scale fisheries could be collected through such tools as the\nnational census, nutrition surveys, agriculture censuses, household\nincome and expenditure surveys (HIES), and poverty studies.\nIn many countries, the underestimation of the value of fisheries\nexports in official customs statistics is a major source of error in the\ncalculation of fisheries contribution to national economies.  It appears\nthat the export information could be worse in fisheries than in most\nother sectors.  In countries where this problem is especially acute, it\nis recommended that export valuation be based on a broader spec-\ntrum of information than what is  provided by customs.\nAdditional information on the economics of small-scale fish-\neries would contribute to improving measurement of the fisheries\n52512_ADB_Fisheries_prelims_new.p65 30 7/4/02, 6:53 PM", "References xxxi\nExecutive Summary xxxi\ncontribution to GDP.

In discussions with Forum Fisheries Agency\n(FFA) and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), ADB dev-\neloped a concept for a project to improve the accuracy of the esti-\nmates of the contribution of fisheries to national economies. At a\nlater stage, World Bank agreed to participate in this joint activity.\nThe partners in this activity established that the immediate\nobjective of the project would be to measure the economic contri-\nbution of fisheries to the economies of Pacific Island nations from\navailable data. It was recognized that a thorough quantification of\nthe economic benefits of fisheries would require more than a short\nintervention. Accordingly, longer-term objectives were set as follows:\n(i) To help improve the accuracy of measuring the contribution of\nfisheries to national economies;\n(ii) To generate interest among government fisheries agencies in\nmeasuring the economic contribution of fisheries to their na-\ntional economies;\n(iii) To provide information which could eventually be used to quan-\ntify the benefits of the various fisheries management options.\nIt was decided that the project should initially focus on the fish-\neries contribution to gross domestic product (GDP), including exam-\nining the methods used by national authorities in the calculation of\nthis contribution, commenting on the validity of these methods, and\nproducing an independent estimation of the fishing contribution to\nGDP. A need was also recognized for a compilation of information\non the specific economic benefits of fisheries, including contribu-\ntions to employment, exports, government revenue, and nutrition.\nTo implement the project, two consultants were recruited: (i) a\nfisheries specialist was contracted by ADB, and (ii) a macroeconomist\nwas contracted by World Bank. The information used in compiling\nthis report was collected from May to September 2001.

Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea\n(PNG), Tuvalu, and Vanuatu were not visited due to the constraints\nof time, funding, or airline schedules. Information from those coun-\ntries came either from personal contact with government officials at\nregional meetings or from telephone and e-mail contact. In most\ncountries, it was possible to obtain data from the staff of both the\nfisheries and statistics agencies. However, data coverage was sub-\nstantially better in countries that were actually visited.\nAlthough it would be desirable for the study to be as broad as to\ncover the full fisheries sector of the Pacific Island region, it was neces-\nsary to limit the scope of the exercise. The period covered is gener-\nally the mid- and late-1990s, with 1999 being used in several com-\nparisons. Coverage is limited to the 14 independent Pacific Island\ncountries. While it is recognized that freshwater fisheries are sub-\nstantial in at least one of the countries, the present study is limited to\nmarine fisheries.\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 2 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 3\nNational Accounts and\nAssociated Issues\nTo those involved in fisheries, the importance of the industry to\nthe economy is obvious: (i) exports of fish and fish products earn\nforeign exchange which helps provide the resources needed to pay\nfor crucial imports; (ii) it provides employment for a substantial num-\nber of people; (iii) the catch of commercial and artisanal fishers pro-\nvide an important source of food for the community; and (iv) the\nfish, shellfish, seaweed and other aquatic resources collected by fami-\nlies are a crucial part of their livelihood.\nWhile the importance of fisheries is self-evident to those involved\nin the industry, it is far less obvious to many others. The boats that\ncatch fish for export are often at sea or moored at wharves that are\naway from the public gaze; fishes are purchased in markets and\nretail stores where there is little to link them to the fishing industry;\nand the collection of marine and other aquatic products for home\nconsumption is often taken for granted.\nOf itself, this lack of awareness need not be a problem. It is not\nnecessary for everyone to fully appreciate the significance of any\nactivity in the economy. However, when that lack of appreciation\nextends to policymakers, planners, and development agencies, it can\nmean that fisheries development receives a lower priority than it\ndeserves. One of the keys to ensuring that the fisheries sector re-\nceives the level of support warranted is to make certain that the\nsector\u2019s contribution to the economy is accurately portrayed in a\ncountry\u2019s national accounts.\nNational Accounts\nWhat are they?\nNational accounts are an accounting framework used to measure\nthe current economic activity in a country.1 Most of the countries in\n1 Those readers who would like a more comprehensive description of national accounting will\nfind it well covered in most macroeconomic textbooks. In addition, the supporting documenta-\ntion to the System of National Accounts (SNA) 1993 provides a comprehensive description of\nthe procedures and conventions used in preparing national accounts.\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 3 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "4 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\nthe Pacific publish national accounts. The method used in each coun-\ntry is based on a standardized System of National Accounts (SNA)\nthat was originally introduced by the United Nations in 1953. The\nSNA has since been revised, refined, and was republished in 1993\n(SNA 1993).\nWhat are they used for?\nTypically, governments, international agencies, and private cor-\nporations use national accounts to monitor developments within an\neconomy. In particular, they are used to:\n(i) Monitor changes in economic activity;\n(ii) Make cross-country comparisons;\n(iii) Prepare time-series analysis;\n(iv) Identify functional relationships; and\n(v) Determine aid eligibility/requirements.\nNational accounts are compiled for a succession of time periods,\nthus providing a continuing flow of information that is indispens-\nable for the monitoring, analysis and evaluation of the performance\nof an economy and its components over time. They usually provide\ninformation not only about economic activities but also about the\nlevels of an economy\u2019s productive assets and the wealth of its inhab-\nitants at particular points of time.\nIn practice, while the methods used to construct national\naccounts are based upon a standardized system, there are different\napproaches that can be used and the quality of the data available\ncan vary significantly. There may be substantial differences in the\nmethods used by each country, so care should be exercised when\nmaking cross-country comparisons. In a few cases, the methods used\nwithin a country have changed; hence, inter-temporal comparisons\nfor those countries should also be approached with caution.\nWhat do they show?\nWhile national accounts provide several measures of activity,\nthe two indicators that are most commonly quoted are GDP and\ngross national income (GNI).2 GDP measures the level of domestic\n2 Prior to the 1993 revision of the System of National Accounts, Gross National Income was\nknown as Gross National Product (GNP).\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 4 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 5\nNational Accounts and Associated Issues 5\neconomic activity\u2014i.e., economic activity that took place within a\ncountry during a specified period of time. GNI is the measure of\nnational economic activity, which includes domestic activity (GDP)\nplus the net return to the country from overseas investments and\nremittances. In the case of fishing, these returns from overseas include\nincome from fishing access fees from nonresident fishing by foreign\noperators. This income is classified as \u201crental income.\u201d\nTypically, a comprehensive set of national accounts will show\nthe contribution to GDP by each of the major sectors in the economy,\nplus the distribution of income and expenditure between the vari-\nous classes of enterprise in the economy. For example, GDP is normally\ndivided between major sectors including manufacturing, transport,\nwholesale and retail, agriculture and other primary industries, etc.\nSimilarly, GDP can also be divided among various classes of enter-\nprises including government, private nonprofit, corporations, etc.\nIt is important to note that, although a sector\u2019s contribution to\nnational GDP may seem small, it can be crucially important to the\nnational economy. The country of Iceland provides a good example.\nIceland\u2019s economy is highly dependent on fish and fishing. Fishery\nproducts make up 70% of exports. Despite this importance, the fish-\ning sector contributes only 13% to GDP. This is because many\nfishing-related activities are accounted for in other sectors such as\nmanufacturing. Moreover, much of the economic activity generated\nby fishing, such as retail trade, is counted as value-added in other\nsectors.\nHow are national accounts constructed?\nThe three different approaches to computing the national\naccounts of a country are: production approach, income approach,\nand expenditure approach.\n(cid:127) The production approach views the economy from the per-\nspective of production. The approach measures the gross output\nof each producer then deducts the value of the goods and ser-\nvices purchased from other producers and used in the produc-\ntion process.\n(cid:127) The income approach measures the major components of value-\nadded: employee compensation (wages and other remunera-\ntion), operating surplus (company profits), and indirect taxes\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 5 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "6 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\nnet of subsidies. The sum of these components is the value-added\nto GDP.\n(cid:127) The expenditure approach is based on the final use of the out-\nput produced. It sums the expenditures of the main participants\nin the economy: government final consumption, private final\nconsumption, gross capital formation, and net exports.\nGiven that all three approaches are derived from the same data,\nby definition, the GDP calculated by each should be identical. In\npractice, it is often difficult to measure everything with equal reli-\nability. This means that there may be differences between the results\ngenerated by each approach. However, these differences are seldom\nsignificant.\nDefinitions and Conventions\nAs with any system, a set of procedures and conventions is used\nin compiling national accounts. The nature and application of these\nprocedures and conventions must be taken into account when in-\nterpreting national accounts.\nProductive Activity\nOne of the most basic issues in the preparation of national\naccounts is the nature of activities that are included in the estima-\ntion of domestic product. In particular, any goods or services that\nare produced by a resident of a country for sale are included. Goods\nand services that are for sale are known as market production.\nService activities that are for personal or households\u2019 own con-\nsumption are not included in the calculation of national accounts.\nFor example, house cleaning is not included if carried out by the\nfamily. These goods and services are known as nonmarket produc-\ntion or subsistence production. However, if goods produced for\nown consumption could reasonably be sold, they are included in the\nnational accounts. Subsistence fishing is an example. While the fish\nmay have been caught for a family\u2019s own consumption, the conven-\ntion assumes that the fish could have been sold and, therefore, it\nshould be treated as adding value to the economy. Clearly, this can\nbe a significant issue in fisheries in the Pacific Island countries where\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 6 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 7\nNational Accounts and Associated Issues 7\nlarge numbers of households rely on the harvest of aquatic resources\nfor food and other uses. 3\nGoods and Services\nGoods are physical products such as machinery, food, housing,\nand infrastructure. Services include activities like medical advice,\nhairdressing, policing, and consultancy.\nResidency\nThe nature and extent of residency is a core concept of the SNA.\nIt defines what shall be counted as domestic product. For goods and\nservices to be included in the domestic product of a particular coun-\ntry, a resident of that country must produce them. A resident is an\nindividual or enterprise whose \u201ccenter of economic interest\u201d is within\nthe country. The \u201ccenter of economic interest\u201d is determined by the\nfollowing tests:\n(i) Do residents of the country, in whose area the fishing activity\noccurs, get significant factor payments (i.e., wage or operating\nsurplus) from the activity?\n(ii) Does the government of the country or the individual or the\nbusiness entity located in the country, in whose area the fish-\ning activity occurs, have a day-to-day influence on the way\nthe fishing is carried out?\n(iii) Is the fishing based in the economic territory and/or employ-\ning local staff?\n(iv) Is the fishing an integral part of the domestic economy?\nIt is important to note that a resident need not be a citizen. The\nproduction of foreign nationals is treated as domestic product pro-\nvided the country is the \u201ccenter of economic interest\u201d for the enter-\nprise/individual. This concept is particularly important in the case\nof fishing where many of the enterprises are mobile, and it is common\n3 It has been estimated that about 75% of people in the Pacific Island countries live in rural\nareas and that most of these households produce or collect all or some of their food and\nhouseholds items (Population Statistics, Statistical Bulletin No. 42, South Pacific Commission,\n1995).\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 7 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "8 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\nfor vessels to be staffed by nationals from different countries. In effect,\nthis means that the product of locally-based offshore foreign vessels\nis treated as domestic product of the country from which they are\noperating regardless of the nationality of the crew.\nUnder the SNA, the standard convention is to treat activities by\na foreign operator that take place in a country for less than 12 months\nas being foreign activities. In the case of fishing, it is common for\noffshore foreign vessels to fish for only part of the year in local wa-\nters. In these circumstances, a strict interpretation of the SNA con-\nvention on \u201ctime in country\u201d would treat these activities as foreign\nand only include the license fees as part of the national accounts.\nHowever, where the activities are seasonal and the main activity of\nthe vessels is based locally, it would be more appropriate to follow\nthe \u201ccenter of economic activity\u201d convention and count their pro-\nduction as domestic product.\nA related issue, which is particularly important in fishing, is the\ngeographic extent of the \u201ccenter of economic interest.\u201d The SNA\nconvention is to treat any activity as domestic provided it takes place\nwithin the \u201ceconomic territory\u201d of the country. The SNA boundary\nfor domestic activity is not limited to the political boundary. It ex-\ntends to include the \u201ceconomic territory.\u201d This convention has par-\nticular importance for fishing, especially offshore fishing, which can\ntake place a considerable distance from the land and political bound-\naries of a country. For example, the political boundary is usually\nconfined to the territorial seas, which extend out to 12 miles from\nthe high water level. In practice, most countries use their exclusive\neconomic zone (EEZ) when defining the geographic limits of their\n\u201ceconomic territory\u201d; and in the circumstances, this practice is the\nmost appropriate.\nTwo other \u201cgeographic\u201d issues that must be addressed in fish-\ning are (i) how to treat fishing activities that take place in other juris-\ndictions, and (ii) how to treat those that take place in international\nwaters.\nWhen the fishing occurs in the waters of another country, the\ndetermination of how to treat that activity in the national accounts\ndepends upon the duration of the activity and its \u201ccenter of eco-\nnomic activity.\u201d The SNA indicates that temporary work in a for-\neign country should be treated as domestic product in the home\ncountry (the center of economic activity) of the entity carrying out\nthe job. For example, the income earned by a consultant who\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 8 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 9\nNational Accounts and Associated Issues 9\nnormally resides in the Fiji Islands and undertakes a short-term con-\ntract in Samoa would be treated as Fiji domestic product, i.e. it is\ntantamount to an export (of services). SNA, Section 6.239 states:\nIt should be noted, however, that GDP is not intended to measure the\nproduction taking place within the geographical boundary of the\neconomic territory. Some of the production of a resident producer\nmay take place abroad, while some of the production taking place\nwithin the geographical boundary of the economy may be carried out\nby non-resident producer units. For example, a resident producer\nmay have teams of employees working abroad temporarily on the\ninstallation, repair or servicing of equipment. This output is an export\nof a resident producer and the productive activity does not contribute\nto the GDP of the country in which it takes places. Thus, the distinc-\ntion between resident and non-resident institutional units is crucial\nto the definition and coverage of GDP.\nThis being the case and in the absence of any indication to the\ncontrary such as the formal relocation of the operation, fishing\nactivity of less than 12 months in foreign waters should be treated as\ndomestic product in the home country of the vessel owner/operator.\nFollowing the same convention, fishing that takes place in inter-\nnational waters may be domestic product of a country provided the\noperation is carried out by a resident and is temporary in nature. In\nsome circumstances, fishing carried out in international waters\ncould become a particularly perplexing problem for the compilers of\nnational accounts. Where a fleet operates in international waters\nmost of the time, including transshipping and re-supply, the ques-\ntion of whether to allocate the production as domestic or national\nproduct becomes an issue.\nIt is difficult to set strict rules since each situation is different. In\npractice, the compilers of national accounts will make judgments\nabout where to allocate production of fleets that occurs on the\n\u201cboundaries\u201d of countries and nationality.\nValuation\nIn all cases, national accounts are reported in monetary terms.\nUsually the local currency is used and, almost always, the accounts\nare presented in current market (nominal) values and constant (real)\nvalues. Current market values use the value of the currency at the\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 9 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "10 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\ntime of measurement. Constant values are indexed to the price lev-\nels of a specified year so as to remove the effects of price inflation\nand thereby allow the comparison of real changes over time. It is\nalso common for the international agencies such as ADB, Interna-\ntional Monetary Fund (IMF), United Nations (UN), and World Bank\nto produce national accounts using the equivalent value of a con-\nvertible currency, usually the United States dollar (US$). This prac-\ntice makes it easier to do cross-country comparisons and to track the\nchanges in each country\u2019s international competitiveness.\nAn important valuation convention that is particularly relevant\nfor fishing is the treatment of nonmarket household production\n(subsistence). Since by definition these items are not sold and the\nquantity produced is seldom recorded, it is necessary to make\nassumptions about their value. It is common practice to value non-\nmarket household production conservatively and, in some cases, pro-\nduction for own consumption is not even included in the national\naccounts.\nAssets\nIn the SNA, assets are restricted to things that are produced by\nan economic activity. This distinction is particularly important for\nnatural resources and is a contentious issue, especially in relation to\nthe overexploitation of natural resources.\nNaturally occurring assets such as marine resources, minerals,\nand forests do not enter the national accounts until they are being\nexploited and then only to the extent that they are being exploited.\nUnlike changes in inventories of produced assets, changes in the\nquantum of natural assets are not reflected in the national accounts.\nThis convention ignores the very real impact that changes in abun-\ndance of natural assets have on the \u201cwealth\u201d of an economy. This\ncan result in misleading values being reported on fisheries and other\nsectors that rely on natural resources. For example, the income gen-\nerated from the exploitation of fish is included in the national\naccounts, while the changes in abundance are not. In these circum-\nstances, the short-term gain from the overexploitation of a fish stock\nshows up as a positive gain for the economy. If the changes in abun-\ndance were also taken into account as happens with inventories of\n\u201cproduced assets,\u201d the apparent benefits for the exploitation of natu-\nral assets would be substantially reduced.\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 10 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 11\nNational Accounts and Associated Issues 11\nFishing vs. Fisheries\nFor the purpose of clarity, it is useful to distinguish between the\nterms \u201cFishing\u201d and \u201cFisheries.\u201d \u201cFishing\u201d is commonly used to\ndescribe the various activities involved in the harvest of aquatic\nresources, whereas \u201cFisheries\u201d is usually used to describe a broader\nrange from capture through postharvest handling, transport, pro-\ncessing, and marketing.\nThe conventions used in the SNA and those followed in this\nreport are somewhat different. The categories of economic activities\nrecognized by the SNA are those of the International Standard\nIndustrial Classification of All Industrial Activities (ISIC). In this sys-\ntem, the category relevant to fisheries is ISIC 0500: \u201cFishing, opera-\ntions of fish hatcheries and fish farms, service activities incidental to\nfishing.\u201d   It is important to note the following:\n(i) Postharvest activities, including fish processing, are not included\nin the fishing sector, but rather they are generally counted in\nmanufacturing and other sectors.\n(ii) Aquaculture is included in the sector.\n(iii) Subsistence fishing is a legitimate component of the fishing cat-\negory.\n(iv) For convenience, the sector is usually referred to as \u201cfishing.\u201d\nA useful guide to the classification of an activity as \u201cFishing\u201d is\nprovided in the definitions of \u201cfish\u201d and \u201cfishing\u201d as contained in\nthe fisheries acts of Pacific Island countries. In each case, the defini-\ntions are very similar. The following extract is taken from the Tonga\nFisheries Law:\n\u201cFish\u201d means any aquatic animal, whether piscine or not, and in-\ncludes any cetacean, mollusk, crustacean, coral (living or dead), and\nother coelenterates, sponge, aquatic plants, holothurian (beche-de-\nmer) or other echinoderm, and turtle, and their young and eggs.\n\u201cFishing\u201d means \u2013\n(a) searching for, catching, taking or harvesting fish;\n(b) attempting to search for, catch, take or harvest fish;\n(c) engaging in any other activity which can reasonably be expected\nto result in the locating, catching, taking or harvesting of fish;\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 11 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "12 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n(d) placing, searching for or recovering fish aggregating device or\nassociated electronic equipment including radio beacons;\n(e) any operation at sea directly in support of, or in preparation for\nany activity described in this paragraph; or\n(f) the use of any other vehicle, air or sea borne, including aircraft\nor helicopter use, in relation to any activity described in this\nparagraph except for emergencies involving the health or safety\nof crew members or the safety of the vessel.\nSport Fishing/Whale Watching/Diving\nAs in any system that divides a continuous range of activities\ninto discrete categories, the construction of national accounts re-\nquires some fairly arbitrary dividing line to be drawn between cat-\negories. For example, the activities (or part thereof) of sport fishing,\nwhale watching, and sport diving involve the use and enjoyment of\naquatic resources. The SNA provides little direct guidance on how\nthese activities should be classified. Since in most cases these activi-\nties are forms of entertainment or tourism, the value-added by each\nactivity is generally attributed to other categories in the national ac-\ncounts.\nOther Considerations\nWhile it is well beyond the scope of this report to provide a\ncomprehensive analysis of national accounting, there are a few issues\nthat bear directly on fishing and therefore warrant some discussion.\nThese include (i) how to measure an activity, (ii) how to calculate\nthe value-added by an activity, (iii) the nature of the organization to\nbe treated as an economic entity, (iv) what was the period in which\nthe activity occurred, (v) was the activity domestic or foreign, and\n(vi) whether the activity was commercial or for subsistence.\nSince the level of information available is usually less than per-\nfect and occasionally nonexistent, the compilation of national ac-\ncounts usually involves a number of assumptions, judgments, and\nestimates. In some circumstances, these assumptions and judgments\nmay be incorrect.\nIt must be kept in mind that GDP is an estimate of economic\nactivity; it is seldom a precise calculation. Even though the SNA sets\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 12 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 13\nNational Accounts and Associated Issues 13\nout fairly straightforward procedures, in practice, the analyst is\nusually confronted with many uncertainties. Data are often unavail-\nable, incomplete or suspect; hence, the analyst is forced to make\njudgments about what data to use and how those data should be\ntreated. Some people may find this apparent lack of rigor disturb-\ning, but it is usually unavoidable, especially in \u201cmessy\u201d sectors like\nfishing. To make matters worse, the fishing sector is often only a\nsmall part of GDP, which means that only a limited amount of the\nanalyst\u2019s time and effort can be expended for collecting data to\nupdate the estimate.\nTypically, the sources of data an analyst would use to estimate\nthe contribution of fishing include income and expenditure data from\ncommercial operations, fisheries production and marketing infor-\nmation, and household income and expenditure data. Sometimes,\nsecondary data like social security records, air-cargo records, inter-\nnational market reports, and various reports that bear on aspects of\nthe industry might be used. The choice of which data set to use de-\npends upon the analyst\u2019s judgment about the accuracy of the data,\nits coverage, and the ease of accessing the information.\nMultiplier Effects\nGDP and its component parts provide an important and very\nuseful guide to the structure of an economy, but they do not show\nthe impact of any activity on the economy. For example, the fishing\ncontribution to GDP is limited to the value-added to the economy by\nthe activity of fishing, but the flow effects from the activity of fishing\nappear as value-added by other sectors of the economy. The differ-\nence between \u201ccontribution\u201d and \u201cimpact\u201d can be illustrated by\nconsidering the consequences of an increase in fishing activity. If the\namount of fishing activity increases by $1.0 million and the interme-\ndiate costs used in this activity are $0.4 million, then GDP will in-\ncrease by $0.6 million. At the same time, the $0.4 million spent on\nthe intermediate costs will directly increase the level of activity else-\nwhere in the economy. If $0.1 million of the $0.4 million were spent\non provisions, the contribution by the \u201cWholesale and Retail\u201d sec-\ntors to GDP would increase by $0.1 million less any intermediate\ncosts. In addition, the $0.6 million that has now been added to the\nfishing contribution to GDP is principally wages and profits, most of\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 13 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "14 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\nwhich will be spent by the recipients on goods and services. This, in\nturn, will increase the level of activity in other sectors of the economy.\nThe people who benefit from the sale of goods and services from\n\u201cFishing\u201d will in turn purchase goods and services from others, and\nthereby stimulate further activity. The cycle of activity thus gener-\nated by the initial production will have ripple effects throughout the\neconomy. The aggregate impact will depend upon the extent to which\nthe goods and services purchased are produced domestically and\nthe proportion of their income that people spend or save. The net\neffect on economic activity will almost certainly be far greater than\nthe contribution to GDP. This cycle of impact is known as the multi-\nplier effect.\nIn practice, the multiplier effects can be fairly difficult to calcu-\nlate. The dynamic nature of economies means that every action will\nbe followed by a reaction. Changes in a sector will be at least partly\noffset by changes in the structure of the economy. This was illus-\ntrated by the response of households in Samoa to the impact of taro\nblight on their primary subsistence crop. Most households responded\nby switching their food production efforts to alternative crops, nota-\nbly plantains. So while the level of economic activity committed to\ntaro production contracted, in terms of the overall level of economic\nactivity in the economy, this contraction was largely offset by the\nincrease in the level of activity in plantain production. The net effect\nwas a reduction in economic activity but by a far lesser amount than\nthe reduction in taro production activity.\nWhile it was beyond the scope of this study to identify the mul-\ntiplier effects of fishing, it remains an important issue. In the ab-\nsence of this understanding, the impact of policy changes, manage-\nment strategies and investment can be seriously underestimated.\nValuing Subsistence Production\nThere are several methods that could be used to value subsis-\ntence production including (i) the \u201cfarm gate\u201d pricing (used in this\nreport), (ii) the \u201cvalue of calories\u201d produced, (iii) the \u201copportunity\ncost of labor,\u201d or (iv) the \u201creservation price of labor.\u201d\nThe \u201cfarm gate\u201d pricing method uses the market price of the\nproduct less the cost of getting that product to market. In effect, it is\nsaying that the value of own consumption is equivalent to the price\nthe product could be sold for in the market less the cost of getting\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 14 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 15\nNational Accounts and Associated Issues 15\nthe product to market. This approach implies that the volume of\nsubsistence production would have little or no effect on the market\nprice if it were to be marketed. Where the volume of subsistence\nfar outweighs the volume marketed, this assumption may be too\ngenerous.\nThe \u201cvalue of calories\u201d approach estimates the calorific value\nof home consumption and the cost of purchasing those calories in\nalternative foods. The value of home consumption then becomes the\nvolume of calories consumed multiplied by the cost per calorie. This\napproach does not adequately account for the nonfood items for\nown consumption. It also implies that the \u201cquality\u201d of own produc-\ntion is the same as the \u201cquality\u201d of purchased foods. This may not be\nthe case, especially where a household is willing to pay a premium\nfor purchased goods that are seen as prestige food items. If the value\nof production for own consumption is imputed from premium goods,\nit will be over-valued.\nThe \u201copportunity cost of labor\u201d approach requires data on the\namount of time spent producing the product for own consumption\nand the income that could be earned if the labor was used in an-\nother way. There may, however, be instances when alternative uses\nof labor are few, if not lacking. In such case, the \u201copportunity cost of\nlabor\u201d would be zero; hence, the implied value of own production is\nalso zero. This is obviously not a true representation of the value of\nproduction for own consumption.\nThe \u201creservation price of labor\u201d is a variation of the \u201copportu-\nnity cost of labor.\u201d It also requires information on the time spent\nproducing the product for own consumption. But instead of using\nthe income that could be earned if the labor was used in another\nway, the \u201creservation price of labor\u201d uses the minimum return that\nis necessary to make a person work. In effect, it is the minimum\nacceptable wage rate, which, it should be noted, may be consider-\nably less than any statutory minimum wage rate. This method would\nprobably give the best estimate of the value of subsistence produc-\ntion. But since the data necessary to make the calculation is seldom,\nif ever, available, it is rarely used.\nWhile each of the above methods has its advantages and disad-\nvantages, there are practical issues that determine which method is\nbest used. In this report, the consultants have used the \u201cfarm gate\u201d\npricing method as recommended by SPC in the publication, A Guide\nto Estimating the Value of Household Non-Market Production in the Pa-\ncific Island Developing Countries (Bain 1996).\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 15 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 17\nGuidelines for\nCalculating the Fishing\nComponent of GDP\nGeneral\nAs with the estimation of any contribution to GDP, the most\nappropriate method to use in estimating the contribution of fishing\nwill depend on the nature of the data and the resources available to\ncollect and analyze these data.\nThe compilers of national accounts must strike a balance in their\ndesire for accuracy and the limitations on the time and effort they\ncan dedicate to collecting and analyzing data. In the case of fishing,\nstriking this balance means that they are usually limited to using\ngeneralized estimates of income or production. In the consultant\u2019s\nopinion, the minimum level of aggregation that should be used would\ndivide fishing into three classes of activity: (i) large-scale commercial\nfishing, (ii) small-scale commercial fishing, and (iii) subsistence\nfishing.\nIn the following, large-scale commercial fishing is predominantly\nthe offshore tuna fisheries of the region. Small-scale commercial fish-\ning includes both non-tuna exports and the fishing to supply the\nlocal markets. Subsistence fishing includes fishing for a variety of\nproducts for own consumption. In practice, the distinction between\nsmall-scale commercial fishing to supply the local market and sub-\nsistence fishing is somewhat arbitrary. The working definition used\nis that small-scale commercial fishing includes all activities that are\npredominantly for the purpose of producing fish for sale, whereas\nsubsistence fishing activities are those that are predominantly done\nto produce products for own consumption.\nLarge-scale Commercial Fishing. This activity usually involves\nrelatively few large vessels operated by commercial enterprises. Nor-\nmally, these companies keep financial records so it should be pos-\nsible to undertake an annual income/expenditure survey or, failing\nthat, obtain information from taxation returns. If financial informa-\ntion is available and reliable, the income approach can be used to\nestimate the contribution of large-scale fishing to GDP. It is noted\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 17 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "18 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\nthat the structure and composition of these financial records are\nlikely to vary between enterprises. In the circumstances, if the in-\ncome approach is to be used, the compilers of national accounts\nshould seek advice from people involved in the industry on how to\ninterpret the data.\nWhere financial data are not available or are considered to be\nunreliable, a production approach could be used. If so, it is essential\nto identify a reliable source of production records. This may not be\nas straightforward as it sounds. The ideal situation is where an\nongoing series is compiled from accurate data by an independent\nagency using a consistent method and published in a timely man-\nner. In practice, this is a rare situation. In this report, the consultants\nhave usually relied on data from fisheries literature. While this data\npartially satisfies the independence and accuracy criteria, often\nmethods used to compile the data reported in the literature vary\nand the data are seldom from an ongoing series.\nAlthough the production approach may be the most practical\nmethod to use in estimating the contribution of large-scale fishing to\nGDP, the compilers of national accounts should, in many cases, be\naware of, and compensate for, some important weaknesses in the\nsaid approach:\n(i) The assumption of fixed value-added ratios.  In practice, these ra-\ntios are subject to substantial variation, more so than in any\nindustrial sectors. Major causes of this are changes in catch\nrates and in prices.\n(ii) The difficulty of estimating prices.  Typically, prices for fish vary\nwidely by fish size, species, product form, season, and market\nso that average price estimates derived from price data, as op-\nposed to revenue data, can be substantially inaccurate. \nThese difficulties with the production approach can be at least\npartially compensated for by periodic surveys to \u201cground truth\u201d the\nassumptions on value-added ratios and prices.\nIt is common to use official export figures to estimate the product-\nion of large-scale commercial fishing. Unfortunately, as explained in\nSection 7.2, the official export figures are often inaccurate. An alter-\nnative could be to use the production estimates available in various\nforms from SPC. Price data can be obtained from the FFA Market\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 18 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 19\nGuidelines for Calculating the Fishing Component of GDP 19\nAdvisor. It may also be possible to use an annual informal survey of\nseveral operators but care would be needed to ensure that the infor-\nmation is accurate and unbiased. Given the vagaries of the markets\nfor fish, the operating surplus will vary between years. This, in turn,\nwill affect the size of the value-added ratio. As with the price, it\nshould be possible to estimate the appropriate value-added ratio from\nan informal survey of several operators.\nSmall-scale Commercial Fishing. This activity usually involves\na large number of participants using a variety of gears and fishing\ntechniques. Often the participants do not keep accurate financial\nrecords and, even when they do, the time and cost of accessing those\nrecords each year would be beyond the resources of most statistics\nagencies. In these circumstances, the production approach is usu-\nally the most appropriate method to estimate the contribution of\nsmall-scale commercial fishing to GDP.\nThe difficulty facing the statisticians is finding reliable produc-\ntion and price data for each year. The production of small-scale\ncommercial fishing can be broadly divided into two classes: (i)\nexport products such as trochus, beche-de-mer, aquarium fish, etc.,\nand (ii) food for sale on the local market.\nThe production and value of the export products can vary mark-\nedly between years as the supply and markets fluctuate. In the cir-\ncumstances, the compilers of national accounts have little choice\nbut to obtain new data each year. In some cases, these data are avail-\nable from the local fisheries agency. Where the fisheries agency is\nunable to provide the data, the analysts will need to collect them\nfrom the exporters or from shipping agents.\nIn the absence of up-to-date fishery surveys, it should be pos-\nsible to extrapolate the value of fish produced for domestic consump-\ntion from data obtained in household income and expenditure sur-\nveys (HIES), agricultural censuses, and other such sources. This,\nhowever, relies on the presumption that the HIES and other such\nsurveys collect data on fish consumption and/or production, some-\nthing that is not always the case. Where the data include per capita\nor household consumption estimates, it is possible to extrapolate the\ndata using changes in the population and thereby impute the pro-\nduction. It is likely that prices will remain fairly constant, at least in\nreal terms, so occasional market surveys or data in HIES can be in-\ndexed to the consumer prices to estimate the value of production.\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 19 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "20 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\nSimilarly, the value-added ratios are unlikely to change substantially\nover time so the data from occasional surveys on the economics of\nsmall-scale fishing could be used to derive these ratios.\nSubsistence Fishing. Most rural households in the region do at\nleast some subsistence fishing. The techniques used, the time spent,\nand the contribution the catch makes to the livelihood of the people\nvary considerably.\nThere are several techniques that can be used to impute subsis-\ntence production, but most rely on some measure of household con-\nsumption of food and/or fish. The most common approach is to use\ndata on consumption, expenditure and/or activity from an HIES as\na base, then compute annual production by using changes in popu-\nlation to extrapolate the base data.\nOne of the risks pointed out earlier in this report is the possibil-\nity of double-counting subsistence fishing and small-scale commer-\ncial fishing. Care must be taken to ensure that the value of fishery\nproducts purchased by households from the small-scale commercial\nfishers are deducted from the total consumption when estimating\nthe level of subsistence production.\nValue-added Ratios\nThe production approach to estimating the contribution to GDP\nrequires two basic sets of data: (i) value of gross output of fishing,\nand (ii) intermediate costs.\nIt is usually convenient to express the intermediate costs as apro-\nportion of the gross output. For example, in the case of small-scale\nfishing using motorized boats, the fuel, bait, provisions, and mainte-\nnance are all intermediate costs. If the total value of the catch is$1,000\nand the sum of the intermediate costs is $400, then the proportion of\nthe gross output attributable to intermediate costs is 40%. Therefore,\nthe value-added by small-scale fishing using motorized boats is $1,000\n* (1\u20130.40) = $600. In this example, the intermediate cost ratio is 0.40\nand its reciprocal, 0.60, is the value-added ratio. It should be noted\nthat the intermediate costs refer to operating expenses. Expenditures\non large capital items, such as engines, are capital expenditures and\nare thus not counted as intermediate costs.\nIn practice, each operator is likely to have a different value-\nadded ratio. However, in the preparation of national accounts, it is\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 20 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 21\nGuidelines for Calculating the Fishing Component of GDP 21\nusually not possible to individually measure each operation. The\nnormal practice is to estimate an average value-added ratio for each\ntype of activity for each country. In this report, value-added ratios\nhave been estimated for each of the main categories of fishing that\nare used in the region: (i) large-scale offshore fishing, (ii) small-scale\ncommercial fishing, and (iii) subsistence fishing. In addition, there\nare various types of specialty fishing\u2014including aquarium fish and\nrelated products, diving, seaweed culture and collection, and pearl\ncultivation\u2014each of which has its own value-added ratio.\nCalculating Value-added Ratios\nLarge-scale Offshore Fishing. All the enterprises involved in this\nsector are of large-sale commercial operations. Of necessity, these\nenterprises keep records of their income and expenditure from which\nit is possible to calculate a value-added ratio. It should be noted that\nif income and expenditure data are available for every enterprise\nin the sector, an income approach to calculating the value-added\nratio would normally be used. However, when this is not the case,\nanalysts must resort to using a production approach based on over-\nall production from large-scale fishing and price data. In these cir-\ncumstances, a sample of the income expenditure of one or more\ntypical enterprises can be used to calculate the value-added ratio for\nthe sector.\nSmall-scale Commercial Fishing. This sector is usually more\ndiverse than large-scale commercial operations. There is often a\nmarked difference in the type of vessel used by each enterprise. Typi-\ncally, the vessel used could be specially designed fishing boats with\ninboard motors, outboard skiffs, and canoes. The cost of operating\neach type of vessel differs and, hence, the value-added ratio of the\nrelated activity also differs. Some enterprises may keep income and\nexpenditure records, but many do not. Also, it is often difficult to\nsplit the sector catch between each class of activity. In the circum-\nstances, the analyst usually must resort to using a generalized estimate\nof value-added ratios based upon information about the composi-\ntion of the fleet. Information from which to estimate the value-added\nratios for small-scale fishing may be available from (i) the records of\ndevelopment banks and other financial institutions, (ii) surveying\nthe sector, (iii) published reports on the sector including studies into\nthe benefit/cost of proposed development projects, and (iv) anecdotal\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 21 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "22 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\ninformation from discussions with people involved in the sector.\nSubsistence Fishing. The subsistence sector is also quite diverse.\nSubsistence fishing can include gleaning, canoe fishing, gill netting,\ncast nets, fish drives, fish traps, torch fishing, and trolling from motor-\nized skiffs. While the value-added ratio for each activity is different,\nin general, it should be possible to categorize subsistence fishing into\ntwo sets of activities: (i) those that involve motorized boats, and (ii)\nthose that do not. The nonmotorized fishing activities have a very\nlow level of intermediate cost and, therefore, a high value-added\nratio. It would be rare for the value-added ratio of the non-motor-\nized activities to be less than 90%. In contrast, the motorized subsis-\ntence fishing activities range from high-cost trolling to medium- and\nlow-cost bottom fishing. Estimating the value-added ratio of the\nnonmotorized activities is likely to prove most difficult; but, given\nthe high percentage of value-added in these activities, slight errors\nin the value-added ratio used for them is unlikely to result in a major\ndifference in the estimated contribution to GDP. The value-added\nfrom motorized fishing activities should be very similar to that of the\nsmall-scale commercial fishing. Given the difficulty in separating the\ngross output of each activity in the subsistence sector, a reasonable\napproach is to estimate an average value-added ratio weighted by\nthe proportion of the catch (by value) taken by nonmotorized and\nby motorized fishing activities.\nSources of Value-added Ratios\nIn this report, the consultants have relied upon (i) published\nestimates of value-added ratios, (ii) the ratios used in calculating\nnational accounts in various countries, (iii) reported income and\nexpenditure data for some activities, (iv) discussions with people\ninvolved in the industry, and (v) their own knowledge and experi-\nence.

Methods\nused in the official calculation of the fishing contribution to GDP are\nalso presented, and some comments are made on the suitability of\nthose methods.\nThe official data on GDP and fishing contribution are summa-\nrized in Table 4.\nRationale for Re-estimating the Fishing Contribution to GDP\nThe fishing sector is complex. It includes thousands of produc-\ners operating in many locations and using a wide variety of tech-\nniques. Crew are often paid in kind or receive a share of the catch\nrather than wages; and even when they do receive wages, collecting\ninformation on those wages can be difficult. In comparison to other\nsectors of Pacific Island economies such as government, manufac-\nturing, or tourism, calculating the contribution of fishing to an\neconomy is a particularly difficult task.\nIn most Pacific Island countries, there is surprisingly little coop-\neration between the fisheries agencies and the statisticians respon-\nsible for compiling the national accounts. Given that the calculation\nof fishing contribution to an economy requires considerable insight\ninto the technical aspects of fishing, this lack of cooperation is dis-\nconcerting. Although fisheries agencies appear eager to have the\nimportance of fishing to an economy properly reported, most seem\nto be ineffective in ensuring that this happens.\nWhile the fishing sector is undoubtedly very important in all\nPacific Island countries, in most, it accounts for a relatively modest\nshare of GDP. Given this situation, it is unreasonable to expect the\ncompilers of national accounts to dedicate a large proportion of their\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 27 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "28 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\ntime to measuring the contribution of fishing to the economy. This\nconstraint, when combined with the complexity of the sector and\nthe lack of cooperation with the fisheries agencies, results in a situation\nwhere the estimated contribution of fishing to GDP is often\ninaccurate.\nGiven the complexity of the issues to be addressed and the large\ndifference in the accuracy of the estimates made in the Pacific Island\ncountries, the consultants considered it essential to re-estimate the\nfishing contribution to GDP for each country. It was believed that, at\nthe very least, the re-estimates would provide useful comparators\nfor the compilers of national accounts. In addition, it was anticipated\nthat the review of the different methods and approaches used in\neach country would provide useful insights into the effectiveness of\nalternative approaches to calculating the fishing contribution to GDP.\nRe-estimates of the Fishing Contribution to GDP\nThe methods used in calculating the fishing contribution to GDP\nof the various countries were analyzed by the consultants. Com-\nments on the suitability of these methods are given in Appendix 1.\nIn some of the countries, the methods used to calculate the fish-\ning component of GDP were well documented. In others, this infor-\nmation was obtained verbally. It is likely that at least some of this\nverbal information were inaccurate for various reasons, including\nthe provider being unfamiliar with the subject. This should be taken\ninto account when considering the comments on any weakness in\nthe methodology used in a particular country.\nThe consultants re-estimated the fishing contribution to GDP in\neach of the countries. The methods used and the new estimates are\ngiven in Appendix 1.

A discussion of some of these\nissues may help improve future estimates.\nIn several of the Pacific Island countries, the individuals respon-\nsible for calculating the fishing contribution to GDP (sometimes these\nindividuals are responsible for all the other sectors) appear to be\nunfamiliar with the technical basis of the methods they used for\ndetermining the fishing contribution. According to discussions with\nseveral such individuals, methods presently being used were devel-\noped by a colleague who has since departed. A \u201crecipe\u201d is now be-\ning followed, but the rationale for many components is apparently\nnot understood by these individuals to the degree by which they are\nable to explain the methodology used.\nSubsistence fisheries form a large component of the fishing sec-\ntor in most Pacific Island countries. There are problems dealing with\nthe treatment of subsistence fisheries in GDP calculations in several\ncountries, and these often result in underestimating the importance\nof the entire fishing sector. In some countries, because the statistics\nagencies lack data on subsistence fisheries, the contribution to GDP\nis not calculated and effectively become recorded as zero. In other\ncountries, because of the manner in which subsistence information\nis collected for GDP purposes, it is not possible to isolate fishing from\nthe other subsistence activities. In which case, the reported \u201cfish-\ning\u201d sector is actually \u201cfishing other than subsistence fishing.\u201d  The\neffect on the GDP contribution can be substantial in, for example,\nFiji Islands where subsistence fisheries are responsible for over 50%\nof the domestic fisheries production.\nAlthough in the SNA scheme the processing of fish (packaging,\nloining, canning) is outside the \u201cfishing\u201d sector, it may often be use-\nful to know the GDP contribution of this fisheries-related activity. In\nmost countries where substantial fish processing occurs, it was not\npossible for the consultants to identify its GDP contribution because\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 31 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "32 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\nthis information was lumped under the general category on \u201cfood\nprocessing.\u201d  On further reflection over the desirability of isolating\nfish processing in the national accounts, there appears to be two\nvery different types of fish processing: (i) processing that is intimately\nrelated to the fishing and fish resources of the country concerned\n(for example, the tuna cannery in Madang), and (ii) processing that\nis unrelated to the fishing and fish resources of the country con-\ncerned but rather processing of imported bulk food (for example,\nthe mackerel cannery in the Fiji Islands which uses raw product\nfrom the United States [US]).\nIn the future, it is likely that an increasing share of the benefits\nfrom \u201cfisheries\u201d will come from fish processing. This being the case,\nthere is a strong argument for the national accounts to disaggregate\nwithin the food processing sector the specific contribution of fish\nprocessing. The Fiji Islands has recognized this advantage and, in\nthe future national accounts, the value added from fish canneries\nwill be shown separately.\nA common problem encountered by the consultants was the\ndiscrepancy between the official figures and other probably more\nreliable sources of information for a crucial input into the GDP cal-\nculations. This frequently occurs when export information is used to\nvalue the gross output of a subsector of the fishing sector. Official\nexport figures in the Pacific Island countries characteristically un-\ndervalue exported commodities, especially fisheries products. Fre-\nquently, there is better information available from such sources as\nthe industry, independent observers, fisheries agencies, and audited\naccounts of exporting companies. Statistics departments, however,\noften use the official figures because (i) the data can easily be ac-\ncessed, (ii) they are required by government policy to use such fig-\nures, (iii) these do not require technical insight to make a judgment\ncall, (iv) there is the perception that these figures are not biased by\ncommercial factors, or (v) of a desire for consistency. Despite these\nreasons, the net result of calculating GDP using obviously inaccu-\nrate official information is lowered credibility for the national ac-\ncounts.\nOne of the difficulties facing any analyst trying to determine\nthe value added to GDP by small-scale fishing is the scarcity of infor-\nmation on the economics of small-scale fishing in the Pacific Island\ncountries. It is noted that in the 1980s the assistance provided to the\nPacific Island countries by the FFA included support for the analysis\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 32 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 33\nSome Observations of Fishing Contribution to GDP 33\nof the economics of small-scale fishing. In the early 1990s, when the\nFFA changed its focus of operations to concentrate almost entirely\non the tuna fisheries, the organization virtually ceased its involve-\nment in the analysis of small-scale coastal fisheries. Despite the clear\nneed for further work in the area, the task was not taken up by SPC\nor any other regional organization. One important consequence is\nthat there is little information available on the economics of small-\nscale fisheries. This information would be of considerable assistance\nto the compilers of national accounts.\nHIES are a valuable tool for obtaining national account infor-\nmation including fisheries. In addition, it was noted that for some\ncountries, like Tonga and FSM, these surveys are an important source\nof information on national fisheries production. It was noticed, how-\never, that many of the HIES used were quite old. Also, the fisheries\ninformation produced from the HIES could have been made more\nuseful had there been some technical inputs from the government\nfisheries agency into the survey design.\nThere appears to be a lack of \u201cchampions\u201d for the fisheries sec-\ntor. In many sectors of the economies of Pacific Island countries,\nthere are groups or individuals who are vocal at stressing the impor-\ntance of their respective sector, supplying the government with in-\nformation that emphasizes this importance, and correcting govern-\nment information/statistics which downplay this importance. There\ndo not appear to be such champions for fisheries, as there are in\ntourism, manufacturing, and the other sectors.\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 33 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 35\nFisheries Production\nLevels\nSummary Information\n Information on the annual fisheries production in each of the\nPacific Island country is given in Appendix 2.

Transshipment costs were subtracted\nfrom these prices to arrive at an in-country value for the catch.\nAs 1999 is the most recent year for which most the Pacific Is-\nland countries have GDP information, efforts to estimate fisheries\nproduction were focused on that year. Given the relative size of the\noffshore fisheries, any atypical features of the tuna fisheries in 1999\nmay affect the average situation that  the estimates were intended to\nportray. Because Hampton et al. (2000) indicate that 1999 was typical\nof a La Ni\u00f1a situation, with the Southern Oscillation Index remain-\ning in the positive range throughout 1999, it is likely that the year\nwas not unusual for tuna fishing.\nGeneral Comments\nIn attempting to obtain national fisheries information for this\nstudy, it became apparent that most countries in the region have\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 37 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "38 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\nvery limited knowledge of overall national fisheries production. Typi-\ncally, government fisheries agencies give low priority to estimating\nthe total amount of domestic catches. In general, the smaller the\nscale of the fishing, the less is known about the production levels,\nwith quantitative information being especially scarce for the subsis-\ntence fisheries. Samoa, where a survey of village fisheries has re-\ncently been completed, is a notable exception.\nWhere attempts have been made to estimate national produc-\ntion from small-scale fisheries, the estimates have usually been made\nfrom data gathered from HIES, nutrition, and other surveys outside\nthe fisheries sector. In the cases where this information has come\nfrom surveys focused on fisheries, the techniques have usually in-\nvolved dietary recall rather than methods such as creel surveys or\nsampling at landing points. Considering this dependence on recall,\nsome validation (\u201cground truthing\u201d) may be in order.\nIn calculating national fisheries production, once a figure for\nthe national production of the fisheries sector (or subdivision) has\nbeen established, it is common practice to use that figure for years or\neven decades with little adjustment except for population growth.\nThis can produce erroneous estimates, especially when the original\nestimates were of poor quality.\nSome notable patterns in the fisheries production data are:\n(i) The weighted average price per kg for the whole region for the\nvarious categories are $1.04 for the production from subsis-\ntence fisheries, $2.41 for coastal commercial, $1.28 for locally-\nbased offshore, and $1.04 for foreign-based offshore.\n(ii) The ranking of countries by total fisheries production is strongly\ninfluenced by the level of tuna catches.\n(iii) There is a general pattern of decreasing total national catches\nif one goes from west to east  across the region, and from equa-\ntorial to higher latitudes.\n(iv) The value of longline tuna relative to purse seine tuna is appar-\nent from the ranking of FSM (third place in volume but first\nplace in value) due to relatively more longlining activities in\nFSM than in PNG or Kiribati.\n(v) The Fiji Islands appears to have the largest non-tuna produc-\ntion, in terms of both volume and value.\n(vi) The production from Tuvalu and Nauru is almost entirely rela-\nted to tuna fishing.\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 38 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 39\nFisheries Production Levels 39\nComparisons with Previous Work\nThe only previous attempt to estimate and summarize volumes\nand values of national fisheries production in the Pacific Island region\nwas that by Dalzell, Adams, and Polunin (1996) in  \u201cCoastal Fisher-\nies in the Pacific Islands\u201d (herein referred to as the Dalzell study).\nThe information contained in the Dalzell study, as well as in numer-\nous other studies of fisheries in the region, has proven extremely\nuseful for the present survey. For some countries, the Dalzell study\nremains the sole estimate of total national coastal fisheries catches.\nThe present survey used, among others, the Dalzell study, more\nrecent surveys, and studies outside the fisheries sector containing\nrelevant information. There are some differences in the results of\nthe Dalzell study and the present study. Some of these differences\nreflect actual changes in fisheries over the past 10 years (e.g., in-\ncreased commercialization of fisheries in FSM). Others arise because\nof the availability of additional information on which to make the\nestimates (e.g., the use of HIES information in Tonga); while others\nreflect distortions due to changes in the value of local currencies\nrelative to the US dollar (e.g., the PNG kina devalued 270% during\nthe decade).\nBearing the above in mind, some observations can be made on\nthe differences between the present study and that of Dalzell\u2019s:\n(cid:127) Subsistence Production. The volume estimates made in this\nstudy are about 25% higher than those in the Dalzell study.\nThis seems reasonable considering the population of the region\nincreased by about 27% during the 1990s (Ryan and Stepanoff\n2000). The country which showed the largest difference in vol-\nume estimates was Tonga, where the difference is mainly due\nto the use by the present study of information from an HIES.\nDifferences in the value of the subsistence catch between the\ntwo studies were also significant, with the present study using\nvalue estimates which are about 50% less than those used in the\nDalzell study. This difference in value estimates can mostly be\nattributed to (i) the method used to value subsistence catches\n(the present study used the \u201cfarm gate\u201d schemefor valuation,\nwhile the Dalzell study mostly used full market values), and\n(ii) the changes in local currency exchange rates relative to the\nUS dollar, especially in PNG and the Solomon Islands.\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 39 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "40 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n(cid:127) Commercial Coastal Production. In this study, estimates of the\ncatch volume are almost 50% higher than in the Dalzell study.\nFSM and Samoa reported significant real increases in volume\nestimates, while other countries showed increases which are\nmainly due to the availability of better information (e.g., Tonga,\nSolomon Islands, and Tuvalu). The value estimates in US dol-\nlars of the commercial coastal production generally increased\nby about 35%. There are, however, countries that showed a\ndecrease in value estimates. The drop may be due to actual de-\nclines in either activity (Vanuatu) or exchange rates (Fiji Islands).\nThe major increase in volume/value reported for the Cook Is-\nlands is due to the inclusion of pearl aquaculture in the esti-\nmates of the present study.\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 40 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 41\nSummary of Information\non Employment, Exports\nand Imports, Access Fees,\nand Fish Consumption\nFisheries-related Employment\nInformation on employment in the fisheries sector is given for\neach Pacific Island country in Appendix 2.\nIt is difficult to summarize the available information on the con-\ntribution of fisheries to employment in Pacific Island countries for\nseveral reasons:\n(i) The various sources of information on fisheries employment\nrange from informal estimates to structured surveys.\n(ii) The data originate from studies ranging from initiatives con-\nfined to the fisheries sector to much broader exercises that cov-\nered all economic sectors or the entire population.\n(iii) The various terms used to categorize employment (e.g., subsis-\ntence, employment, total employment, paid work, workforce,\nfisher) differ between studies and between countries.\n(iv) The studies deal, in different ways, with the various mixes of\npaid, unpaid work, and work for the family.\n(v) There is inconsistency across countries in the categorization of\nfish processing.

In another survey, a \u201cfisher\u201d is defined as a person who\nparticipated in fishing during the 2-week period prior to the\nsurvey.

However,\nin Palau, \u201cemployed\u201d is defined as \u201cat work at all times during\nthe reference week as a paid employee.\u201d\nDespite its shortcomings, some observations can be made on\nthe existing information on the importance of fisheries employment:\n(i) The importance of fisheries in subsistence seems to have a strong\nrelationship to the type of island. The level of significance is\nhighest in atolls, followed by small islands, and least in large\nhigh islands. This pattern is somewhat altered by PNG with its\nimportant freshwater subsistence fisheries.\n(ii) The importance of fisheries in formal employment seems to be\nrelated more to business conditions than to island type. These\nconditions include, among others, proximity to processing fa-\ncilities, schedule of airline connections, and fuel taxation. Most\nformal employment in fisheries appears to be tuna-related.\n(iii) The accurate portrayal of the importance of women in fisher-\nies employment appears to be negatively affected by (i) the con-\ncept of using \u201cmain unpaid activity\u201d for defining the subsis-\ntence fisheries sector, as it downplays the importance of sec-\nondary activities (e.g., even for women who do considerable\nfishing, childcare is often the main unpaid activity); and (ii)\nplacing commercial fish processing (where many women are\nemployed) in the manufacturing sector.\n(iv) Where commercial fish processing occurs (e.g., canning, loining)\nand where this is attributed to the fisheries sector, the increase\nin size of fisheries employment is remarkable.\n(v) Overseas employment in industrial fishing vessels does not ap-\npear to be captured in many of the employment surveys.\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 42 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 43\nSummary of Information on Employment, Exports and Imports... 43\nTable 8: The Relative Importance of Fisheries in\nPaid Employment and in Subsistence\nCountry Basic Information on Fisheries-related Employment\nCook About 22.0% of the population, or approximately 4,435 people, were\nIslands involved in subsistence fishing.

However, some conjecture\non the subject could be made and may even prove useful, if only to\nencourage refinement of the employment estimates.\nMcCoy (1991) estimated that, in the Pacific Islands, there were\n17,080 motorized fishing vessels and 24,612 nonmotorized fishing\nvessels. If it is assumed that (i) 75% of the motorized vessels and\n10% of the nonmotorized vessels are used in some form of commer-\ncial fishing, and (ii) an average of three crew are carried on a motor-\nized commercial vessel and 1.5 crew are carried on a nonmotorized\ncommercial vessel, then the number of employed in commercial fish-\ning is about 42,000. This figure must, however, be adjusted by (i) the\ncommercial fishers who do not use a vessel, and (ii) the 1,200 men\nthat McCoy and Gillett (1997) estimated to be working on the 10\nmajor foreign fleets operating in the region.  Using this reasoning,\nabout 45,000 Pacific Islanders appear to be presently involved in\ncommercial fishing in the region.\nOf relevance to the present study on the economic importance\nof fisheries, few of the surveys which produced information on fish-\neries-related employment were (i) specifically designed with the ob-\njective of determining the relative importance of employment in the\nvarious sectors, and (ii) formulated with sampling strategies appro-\npriate for the fisheries sector.\nThe Fiji Islands\u2019 1998 Employment Survey provides an example\nof a survey using a sampling strategy suitable to the fisheries sector.\nIntuitively, the amount of fishing employment suggested by the sur-\nvey seems low\u2014340 people with paid employment.  In another study,\nit has been estimated (Gillett et al. 2001) that the Fiji domestic\nlongliners alone employ 340 people as crew. Discussions with the\nFiji Bureau of Statistics officials revealed that the following may have\ncontributed to their low estimate:\n(i) The survey used the postal enquiry system in which question-\nnaires were mailed out. Large firms (e.g., gold mining, garment\nmanufacturing) are more likely than small fishing enterprises\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 44 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 45\nSummary of Information on Employment, Exports and Imports... 45\nto return the forms, or subsequently respond to government\npressure to return the forms.\n(ii) The framework of the survey is based on the business register,\nand the smaller the firm, the less likely it is to be on the register.\n(iii) The survey and the follow-up for nonresponse were focused\non the islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, whereas there are\nmany fishing enterprises located outside of the Fiji Islands\u2019 two\nmain islands.\nOther information on fisheries employment in the Fiji Islands\nsuggests that the 1998 survey underestimated fisheries employment\nby more than an order of magnitude. One lesson learned from this\nexample and from other employment surveys encountered during\nthe present study is that, due to the complexity of the fisheries sec-\ntor, it is relatively difficult to examine. Simple sampling strategies,\nwhich may be suitable for other sectors, may not be appropriate for\nestimating employment in the fisheries sector.\nTo accurately gauge the relative importance of fisheries in\nnational paid employment, it is necessary to have a survey that\ncovers all sectors of the economy, rather than just have a fisheries-\nspecific study. The sampling strategy for such a national level study\n(e.g., national census, HIES, labor survey) must not be biased against\nparticular sectors, which in the case of fisheries would require at\nleast some dialogue between the designers of the survey and those\nwith technical expertise in fisheries.\nTo accurately gauge the relative importance of fisheries in subsist-\nence activity, the concept of enumerating subsistence fishers appears\ninappropriate. It would be more realistic to partition subsistence\nactivity into its various sector components. This activity analysis, as\nwith the paid employment survey above, would need to be done at\na level higher than the fisheries sector to accurately portray the rela-\ntive importance of the various subsistence activities, including fishing.\nExports and Imports of Fishery Products\nSummary of Nominal Information\nTable 9 lists the nominal values of fishery product exports.

This underestimation appears large and relatively worse\nthan in other trade sectors. In most cases, when the official export\nvalues are compared to other sources of similar information (e.g.,\nimporting country information, Convention on the International\nTrade of Endangered Species [CITES] records, audited exporting\ncompany accounts), the differences are remarkable. There are\nseveral possible reasons for the differences:\n(i) Most government customs departments are oriented to taxing\nimports and may give low priority to documenting exports.\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 48 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 49\nSummary of Information on Employment, Exports and Imports... 49\n(ii) Keeping track of fisheries exports, as compared to other major\ncommodities exported by Pacific Island countries, is more com-\nplex due to:\n(a) presence of many exporters;\n(b) a multitude of different products each with different\nvalues;\n(c) large numbers of small shipments; and\n(d) many different export points.\n(iii) Often there is no examination by customs departments of the\nexported commodities.\n(iv) Because much of the exported fish is sold through auctions,\nexporters typically do not know the price of the products at\nthe time of export.\n(v) There are numerous incentives for exporters to place a low\nvalue on exports\u2014e.g., taxation, foreign exchange controls,\nhiding income from partners.\nAnother problem in accurately quantifying fisheries exports is\nthat, in many countries, products that would normally be consid-\nered fishery products are not being captured in the official export\nstatistics:\n(i) For some countries, fisheries exports are confined to finfish.\n(ii) Coral exports are not considered to be a fishery product in at\nleast two countries.\n(iii) Some countries specifically list a few important fisheries\nexports, and lump other fishery products together with mis-\ncellaneous nonfishery commodities. Consequently, the total\nvalue of fisheries exports cannot be determined from official\npublications.\nFor imports, when the data identify fishery products, the qual-\nity for measuring volumes/values appears better than that for ex-\nports. For some countries, however, it is not possible to determine\nthe product form (fresh/frozen vs. canned), which creates difficul-\nties for estimating per capita consumption.\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 49 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "50 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\nAccess Fees\nAccess fees are a charge for the right to harvest a resource. For\nthe purpose of national accounting, they are considered to be a charge\npaid by nonresidents for the use of a tangible nonproduced asset.\nThus, the fee is not part of the value of production from a fishing\nactivity, and it is therefore not included in the calculation of the fish-\ning contribution to GDP.\nSummary of Information\nAll Pacific Island countries received fees for foreign fishing activ-\nity in their waters. For many countries, information on the amounts\nof these fees is available in published documents; while in other cases,\nit must be estimated from fishing activity patterns. Table 11 presents\nthe access fees received in 1999 and compares these fees to the\nnational GDP.\nComments on Access Fees\nIt may be tempting to compare the 1999 access fees above to the\nvalue of the 1999 catches under the category \u201cOffshore foreign-based\nvessels\u201d to determine the ratio of the fee to the value of the catch.\nThis, however, would be inappropriate as, in some countries (e.g.,\nFSM and Palau), there are fee-paying foreign vessels under the cat-\negory \u201cOffshore locally-based.\u201d\nIn some countries, the access fees form a very large portion of\ngovernment revenue. In the FSM, for example, the 1999 access fees\nrepresented an estimated 39% of non-tax revenue and 22% of\ntotal domestic revenue for the national government. In Kiribati,\n34% of government income in 1999 was derived from license fees.\nSome interesting features from the information presented in\nTable 11 above are:\n(i) Access fees are only significant for 7 of the 14 Pacific Island\ncountries.\n(ii) There is one case (Niue) in which an apparently small\naccess fee is actually quite significant in terms of the national\neconomy.\n(iii) There is another case (PNG) in which an apparently large access\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 50 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 51\nSummary of Information on Employment, Exports and Imports... 51\nTable 11: Estimated Value of Access Fees Received from\nForeign Fishing Vessels and GDP, 1999\nAccess Fees GDP Access Fees\nCountry (US$) (US$) as % of GDP\nKiribati 20,600,000 48,123,871 42.81\nTuvalu 5,900,000 13,848,788 42.60\nFSM 15,400,000 229,869,864 6.70\nNauru 3,400,000 51,612,903 6.59\nMarshall Islands 4,982,699 97,311,800 5.12\nNiue 151,793 7,514,077 2.02\nPalau 800,000 113,484,869 0.70\nCook Islands 169,072 82,371,930 0.21\nPNG 5,840,000 3,415,590,478 0.17\nTonga 152,041 157,018,257 0.10\nSolomon Islands 273,458 279,593,229 0.10\nVanuatu 218,448 226,280,313 0.10\nSamoa 188,616 233,506,665 0.08\nFiji Islands 212,000 1,821,334,281 0.01\nFSM = Federated States of Micronesia; GDP = gross domestic product; PNG = Papua New Guinea.\nSource: As per country access fees section in Appendix 2.\nfee is actually quite insignificant in terms of the national\neconomy.\n(iv) For nearly half of the Pacific Island countries, the US multilat-\neral treaty provides most of the access fees, despite the fact\nthat there is little or no US fishing in those countries.\nFish Consumption\nSummary of Information\nAppendix 2 contains information on the annual per capita\nconsumption of fishery products in each of the Pacific Island coun-\ntries.

The exceptions to this are Tonga, where the\nstudies suggest surprisingly low fish consumption rates, and\nPalau, where fish consumption rate is remarkably high.\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 52 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 53\nSummary of Information on Employment, Exports and Imports... 53\n(ii) Most of the Pacific Island countries exceed by a large margin\nthe world average per capita fishery product consumption rate\nof 13.0 kg (Westlund 1995).\n(iii) Most of the estimates for Kiribati indicate that it has the high-\nest rate of fish consumption compared to any country in the\nworld.\nThe studies which provided the above estimates used a variety\nof techniques:\n(i) nutrition studies in which the amount of fish and shellfish con-\nsumed was measured;\n(ii) nutrition studies based on dietary recall;\n(iii) HIES which estimated the volume of fishery products con-\nsumed;\n(iv) exercises in which the fishery production is divided by the\npopulation; and\n(v) exercises that take the fishery production less exports plus\nimports to arrive at a gross consumption figure that is divided\nby the population.\nAlthough, in theory, the various techniques should give equiva-\nlent results, the situation in Niue is an example where different esti-\nmates of per capita consumption were calculated:\n(cid:127) Dalzell et al. (1993) estimated per capita fish consumption us-\ning a 1987 SPC nutrition study. It indicated an annual per capita\nconsumption of 40.8 kg food weight, or about 49.0 kg whole\nfish weight.\n(cid:127) Considering (i) the Niue population of 1,900 people in 2000 (Ryan\nand Stepanoff 2000), (ii) the subsistence fisheries production of\n194 mt, (iii) the commercial production of 12 mt, and (iv) im-\nports of 20 mt, the annual per capita consumption of fishery\nproducts in Niue appears to be about 118.9 kg.\nThis variation suggests the need for some \u201cground truthing\u201d to\ngauge the validity of the estimation. This is especially important con-\nsidering that many of the total national fishery production estimates\nare derived from nutrition studies.\nQuantifying consumption by using import, export and produc-\ntion data is complicated by several factors:\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 53 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "54 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n(i) The low quality of data on the export of fishery products;\n(ii) Uncertainty in some countries over whether the imports of fish-\nery products are whole fish or canned fish;\n(iii) Where there is a large tourist industry, not knowing the full-\ntime-resident equivalent of the tourists.  Apparently, only the\nPalau consumption figures take this into consideration, where\nthe tourist population has been estimated to be equivalent to\n500 full-time residents, or 2.6% of the population.\nAnother important issue in the calculation of per capita fish\nconsumption concerns the estimate of the uppermost limit possible.\nSome of the very high estimates obtained in the surveys cited in\nAppendix 2 (e.g., 207.0 kg per capita per year in Kiribati) are criti-\ncized solely on the intuitive basis that it is not physically possible to\ningest such a large quantity of fish. However, careful examination of\nspecific cases suggests that this concept may not be correct. For ex-\nample:\n(cid:127) Nube (1989) reported that the Kiribati canned fish imports from\n1974 to 1986 ranged from 112 mt to 312 mt per year. Using\ninformation from the 1985 census, Nube calculated the daily\nper capita fish consumption for 18 islands in the Gilbert and\nLine groups. The results ranged from 0.45 kg in South Tarawa\nto 2.86 kg in Arorae. Of the 18 islands listed, 11 of the islands\n(or 61%) have a per capita fish consumption rate greater than\none kg per day.\n(cid:127) Passfield (1997) calculated the annual per capita consumption\nof fish in Tongareva Island as 219.0 kg.\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 54 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 55\nConclusions and\nRecommendations\nThe objectives of the present study were to measure the eco-\nnomic contribution of fisheries to the economies of Pacific Island\nnations from available data and to contribute to improving the ac-\ncuracy of this measurement. The conclusions and recommendations\nare therefore grouped according to these objectives.\nMeasuring the Economic Contribution\nThe official fishing contribution to GDP in various Pacific Island\ncountries in 1999 is given in Section 4.1. The importance to the econo-\nmies of Pacific Island countries, as measured by the percentage of\nGDP, is given in the Figure 9.\nFigure 9: Official Estimates of Fishing Contribution to GDP of\nPacific Island Countries, 1999\n14\n12\n10\n8\n%\n6\n4\n2\n0\nPNG Vanuatu Niue Nauru Fiji Islands Palau Cook Island FSM Tuvalu Tonga IslandsMarshall Samoa Kiribati IslandsSolomon\ns\nIn countries where official estimates are not available (Solomon Islands, Nauru), estimates were\nmade during this study for purposes of comparison.\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 55 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "56 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\nA major conclusion of the present study is that, in most Pacific\nIsland countries, the fishing contribution to GDP has been underes-\ntimated. In five countries, the consultants\u2019 estimates are more than\ndouble that of the official figures. In two cases, the consultants\u2019 esti-\nmates are lower than the official estimates albeit, in the case of the\nCook Islands, the difference is too small to be significant. The differ-\nences between the consultants\u2019 estimates and the official estimates\nare shown in Table 13.\nTable 13: Difference between Consultants\u2019 and Official\nEstimates of Fishing Contribution to GDP\nCountry Difference in Estimates\n(+ / -) (%)\nIncreased\nPalau +441.1\nPapua New Guinea +154.3\nVanuatu +138.8\nFiji Islands +131.8\nKiribati +127.9\nFederated States of Micronesia +103.1\nNiue +18.2\nTonga +5.1\nTuvalu +4.3\nDecreased\nCook Islands -10.6\nSamoa -18.0\nMarshall Islands -50.0\nNo Official Estimates\nNauru \u2014\nSolomon Islands \u2014\nThere is no single reason for the differences in the estimates.\nIn some countries, notably FSM and PNG, the differences are prima-\nrily due to the inclusion of subsistence fishing in the consultants\u2019\nestimates. In other countries, in particular Palau, the difference is\nprimarily due to the methods used. In most, it is a combination of\ndifferences in the estimate of production and the method used to\ncalculate the contribution. For example, in Samoa, subsistence pro-\nduction was valued at the full market value, rather than at \u201cfarm\ngate\u201d prices.\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 56 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 57\nConclusion and Recommendations 57\nAt one extreme, both Nauru and the Solomon Islands have\nmajor problems preparing their national accounts. The difficulty in\ncomputing the fishing component of these accounts is part of the\noverall problem. At the other extreme, Cook Islands, Niue, Tonga\nand Tuvalu all compile soundly based national accounts that include\nreasonable estimates of the fishing contribution. In most of these\nlatter countries, the differences between the consultants\u2019 estimates\nare small. In general, where the differences between the estimates\nare 5.0% or less, they are not significant.\nThe major difference between the consultants\u2019 estimate and the\nofficial Marshall Islands estimate is due to what seems to be the in-\nclusion in the official figures of a contribution from foreign vessels\nthat ceased operating sometime earlier.\nThe main lesson learned is that, in the countries where the esti-\nmates are markedly different, the process of preparing the national\naccounts tends to rely on outdated surveys, inappropriate indica-\ntors, and/or poorly understood methods. In most of these cases, the\ncompilers of national accounts do not appear to have consulted the\nrelevant fisheries agencies or the industry when preparing their\nestimates.\nWhere there is a marked difference between the consultants\u2019\nestimates and the official estimates, the compilers of national accounts\nshould carefully examine and evaluate the data, the assumptions,\nand the methods that they are using. This evaluation should include\nconsultation with the relevant domestic and regional fisheries agen-\ncies. Where significant problems are identified, they should consider\nchanging their methods and/or seeking outside assistance to revise\ntheir methods and approaches to estimating the fishing contribu-\ntion to GDP.\nImproving the Fishing Contribution Estimates\nA major conclusion of this study is that the accuracy of the esti-\nmate of fishing contribution to GDP could be improved with a closer\nliaison between the fisheries and the statistics agencies.  The fisher-\nies agencies are in a position to provide information on new develop-\nments, technical insights, and recent data, all of which could improve\nthe GDP estimates. This cooperation, however, rarely occurs in the\nPacific Island countries. Because fisheries agencies have a vested\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 57 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "58 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\ninterest in assuring that the importance of their sector is not under-\nestimated, they should take the lead in improving this cooperation.\nIt is recommended that the fisheries agencies identify an appropri-\nate staff member to serve as the liaison with the statistics agency\nand with regional organizations. The work program of this indi-\nvidual should be modified to include duties related to measuring the\nfishing sector\u2019s economic contribution.\nOne of the factors causing an underestimation of the fishing\ncontribution is related to the valuation of the production of small-\nscale fisheries. The fundamental difficulty is lack of knowledge of\nvolume of production (for which values could easily be estimated).\nThe low quality of fisheries statistics is a persistent problem in the\nPacific Island countries, and there do not appear to be any practical\nsolutions for many of the data problems in the fisheries sector. At a\nrecent Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/SPC Pacific Islands\nRegional Workshop on Fisheries Statistics, most of the country rep-\nresentatives acknowledged the low level of information on small-\nscale fisheries production and the lack of expertise and/or funding\nin obtaining the information. Given this reality, it is recommended\nthat maximum use be made of survey opportunities outside the fish-\neries sector. At little additional cost, production information on small-\nscale fisheries could be collected through such tools as the national\ncensus, nutrition surveys, agriculture census, HIES, and poverty\nstudies. This would require a pro-active approach on the part of\nfisheries agencies in the planning stage of these surveys to assure\nthat useful fisheries data are obtained.\nIn many countries, the underestimation of the value of fisheries\nexports in official customs statistics is a major source of error in the\nestimation of the fisheries contribution. The export information\nsituation is worse in fisheries than in other sectors. In the countries\nwhere this problem is especially acute, it is recommended that\nexport valuation be based on a broader spectrum of information\nthan solely those provided by customs officials. These additional data\ncould be obtained from the government fisheries agency, industry,\nand knowledgeable individuals. In addition, the regional organiza-\ntions involved in fisheries collect data that could be used in valuing\nexports.\nAdditional information on the economics of small-scale fisher-\nies would contribute to improving the measurement of the fisheries\ncontribution to GDP. This information would improve the under-\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 58 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 59\nConclusion and Recommendations 59\nstanding of input ratios (for the production approach to GDP) and\nthe various forms of income (for the income approach). Such\nstudies need not be complex but should cover the major small-scale\ncommercial and subsistence fisheries.\nThe regional organizations could play an important role in im-\nproving the measurement of fisheries contribution to the economies\nof their member countries. Initiatives could include:\n(i) Measures to inform the national statistical agencies of the avail-\nability of information relevant to fisheries GDP calculations:\n(a) SPC databases have detailed information on tuna pro-\nduction and some information on several important ex-\nport commodities (i.e.,  trochus, beche-de-mer);\n(b) FFA has information on the price of tuna in international\nmarkets.\n(ii) Specifically targeting the fisheries sector in national/regional\nnational accounts training courses;\n(iii) Developing a capability within the regional organizations to\nundertake analysis of the economics of small-scale fisheries;\n(iv) Advice on enhancing the work programs of the fisheries econo-\nmists of government fisheries agencies to facilitate more involve-\nment in measuring the economic impact of their sector;\n(v) Sponsorship of a regional meeting of fisheries economists. It is\nnoted that although the regional organizations have held a\nmultitude of meetings for the various fisheries subsectors (sur-\nveillance, law, management, and statistics), there has never\nbeen a regional gathering of fisheries economists. Such a meet-\ning could have a positive impact on increasing understanding\nof technical issues, as well as generating interest among govern-\nment fisheries agencies in measuring economic contributions.\nOther Conclusions and Recommendations\nThe income approach versus the production approach for the fisher-\nies sector\nIn those circumstances where the compilers of national accounts\nhave access to comprehensive and detailed information on the in-\ncome/expenditure of the participants in one or more sectors of the\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 59 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "60 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\nfishing industry, the income approach is the most appropriate\nmethod of calculating the value-added to GDP. In the Pacific Island\ncountries, it is, however, rare for this data to be available for fishing.\nIn these circumstances, the production approach is likely to be the\nmost accurate method for estimating the contribution of fishing to\nGDP. Even when the compilers of national accounts have access to\ngood quality income/expenditure data, it would be prudent if they\ncross-checked their calculations against estimates made using the\nproduction approach, giving special attention to obtaining accurate\nvalue-added ratios and fish prices.\nLevel of aggregation in national accounts\nIn the national accounts of most Pacific Island countries, fish-\ning is aggregated with agriculture and other primary industry. In\nseveral cases, the fishing component of subsistence is lumped toge-\nther with all other subsistence activities. This aggregation with other\nactivities can make it very difficult to identify the contribution of\nfishing to GDP. This practice is understandable and is not really a\nproblem when the fishing contribution to GDP is very small. But\nwhen fishing makes a significant contribution to GDP, that contri-\nbution should be clearly identifiable in national accounts.\nIn the future, it is likely that an increasing share of the benefits\nfrom the fisheries sector will come from fish processing. Thus, there\nis a strong argument for the national accounts to disaggregate within\nthe food processing sector the specific contribution of fish processing.\nISIC categories\nThere are marked differences between the value-added by dif-\nferent fishing activities and, therefore, it is important to distinguish\nbetween these activities when estimating their contribution to GDP.\nAt a minimum, analysts should distinguish between large-scale off-\nshore fishing, small-scale commercial fishing, and subsistence fishing.\nThe small-scale commercial fishing should be further disaggregated\ninto export-oriented and local supply. Creating expanded ISIC sub-\ncategories to cover at least these activities could facilitate this.\nClassifying subsistence activities\nOne of the difficulties facing any analysts using the production\napproach is determining the appropriate value-added ratios. This\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 60 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 61\nConclusion and Recommendations 61\ncan be particularly difficult for subsistence fishing where the activi-\nties range from reef gleaning, which requires very few inputs, to\ntrolling for tuna, where the costs of fuel, lures and boat maintenance\nare substantial. The large differences between the value-added ratios\nof these activities make it important to have a clear idea of the pro-\nportion of fishing undertaken using each activity. While it may be\nimpractical to try and identify the value-added ratios for each pos-\nsible subsistence activity, at the least the ratios between motorized\nand nonmotorized activities should be differentiated.\nExtrapolation of HIES data\nIn most cases, HIES are sample surveys that rely on the memory\nof the respondents to estimate the level of consumption/expendi-\nture. Even when properly implemented, there is considerable scope\nfor errors in the estimates produced by HIES. As the length of time\nover which the data are extrapolated increases, the risk of error is\ncompounded. It is normal for changes in the overall population size\nto be used to extrapolate consumption/expenditure data. Given the\nmarked differences between the consumption and production pat-\nterns of rural/urban and coastal/inland populations, the use of\nchanges in the overall population size to extrapolate HIES data could\nresult in a biased estimate.\nEconomic impact of fisheries\nWhile GDP is an important measure of the role of fishing in an\neconomy, it does not give the overall impact that fishing has on an\neconomy. Although a study of the multiplier effects of fishing would\nlead to a greater understanding of economic impacts, there is little\ninformation in the Pacific Island countries from which the multi-\nplier effects of fishing can be estimated. In fact, there is very little\ninformation available to estimate the multiplier impact of any activ-\nity in the Pacific economies. It is recommended that further work be\nundertaken to estimate the multiplier effects of fishing on national\nincome and employment in the Pacific Island countries.\n \n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 61 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 63\nReferences\nAbbott, D.

In addition,\nit was anticipated that the review of the different methods and ap-\nproaches used in each country would provide useful insights into\nthe effectiveness of alternative approaches to the task.\nIn some of the countries, the methods used to calculate the fish-\neries component of GDP were well documented.

The most recently published tables include GDP\nestimates from 1982 to 2000. The published accounts show both\ncurrent and real GDP estimates for each of the major sectors and\nindustry groups in the economy. For publication purposes, the fish-\ning industry is grouped with Agriculture.\nThe Statistics Office uses a production approach to calculate\nthe contribution of small- and large-scale commercial fishing to GDP.\nThe Office relies upon a combination of export records, fisheries sur-\nveys and market prices to determine the gross output of these sub-\nsectors. Production by the subsistence sector is imputed from data\ncollected in the 1998 Household Income and Expenditure Survey\n(HIES) that measured household and per capita consumption of fish.\nMethods used to Calculate Contribution to GDP\nTo calculate the contribution of fishing to GDP, the Statistics\nOffice divided the sector into two categories, each with subcategories.\n(cid:127) Incorporated Fishing Enterprises. This category covers all full-\nscale commercial operations including pearl farming, live fish\nexports (aquarium fish), and tuna and other fishing. The value-\nadded output ratios for each of these subcategories are (i) pearl,\n80%;  (ii) pearl shell, 90%; (iii) live fish, 80%; and (iv) tuna and\nother fish, 60%. The value-added ratios appear reasonable given\nthe nature of the different activities.\n(cid:127) Subsistence Fishing. The contribution of subsistence fishing in-\ncludes fishing for home consumption and for informal sales.\nThe estimated contribution from home consumption is based\nupon the 1998 HIES. The values for the years since 1998 are\nextrapolated using population and a composite index to adjust\nfor prices changes and periods of intensive subsistence activity.\nThe estimate of the contribution of informal sales assumes that\nsuch sales are a proportion of home consumption.\nComments on the GDP Calculation\nThe methods used by the Statistics Office are appropriate. How-\never, there are questions about the accuracy of some of the data.\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 79 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "80 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\nThe substantial increase in the fishing contribution to GDP\nbetween 1999 and 2000 captured most of the value added of the\nsector. However, the Manihiki disease survey carried out by the\nMinistry of Marine Resources in December 2000 on Manihiki and\nPenrhyn atolls indicated that the production may be even higher\nthan previously thought (Ponia pers. com.). In particular, the pub-\nlished national accounts may not have taken into account domestic\nsales of pearls to tourists. The survey indicates that the gross output\nin 2000 was NZ$20.4 million, NZ$2.0 million more than the estimate\nused to compile the GDP estimate reported in the 2000 national\naccounts. In addition, the contribution of live fish (NZ$250,000),\ntuna and other fish (NZ$200,000, principally trochus) as estimated\nby the Ministry of Marine Resources have not been included in the\ncalculation (Bertram pers. com.).\nOne of the difficulties facing the compilers of national accounts\nis the choice of data series. In the case of the Cook Islands, the Statis-\ntics Office has chosen to use the official trade figures rather than the\nestimates prepared by the Ministry of Marine Resources that have\nbeen used in this report. Officials from the Statistics Office indicated\nthat there were several sources of data for pearl production includ-\ning one from the Pearl Federation. The information in each of these\nsets of data differs. In the circumstances, the Statistics Office elected\nto use the official trade figures because they are compiled regularly\nand are likely to be ongoing.\nImputing production from the data reported in an HIES is a\nvalid method to calculate the contribution of subsistence fishing to\nGDP, provided there is no better source of data available. The method\nrelies upon the HIES being an accurate reflection of contemporary\nconsumption of, and/or expenditure on, fish. The older the HIES\nthe less likely it is to be relevant. The assumption that informal\nsales are a proportion of household consumption should also be\nreconsidered.\nIn the Cook Islands, there are other estimates of subsistence and\nsmall-scale commercial fishing production. Dalzell et al. (1996) used\ndata sources from the late 1980s and early 1990s to estimate subsis-\ntence fishing and commercial coastal fishing production. They con-\ncluded that the amount and value of production were, respectively,\n858 mt (US$3,047,683) and 124 mt (US$314,761). According to the\nMinistry of Marine Resources, in 2000, small-scale commercial fish-\ning (informal sales) produced 80 mt valued at NZ$650,000 and\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 80 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 81\nAppendix 1 81\nsubsistence production amounted to 795 mt worth NZ$2,200,000\n(Bertram pers. com.). The Statistics Office should examine these data\nand determine whether or not they support the information gath-\nered in the HIES.\nRevised Estimates of GDP\nIncorporated fishing enterprises:\nPearls and pearl shell: NZ$18,400,000 * 0.80 = NZ$14,720,000\nLive fish: NZ$252,000 * 0.80 = NZ$201,600\nOthers (principally trochus): NZ$200,000 * 0.80 = NZ$160,000\nSource of data: Ministry of Marine Resources (Bertram and Ponia, pers.\ncom.).

In the cir-\ncumstances, the following should be treated as commentary on the\nissues that should be addressed rather than a critique of the SAM.\nMethods used to Calculate Contribution to GDP\nIn 1996, 675 establishments in the FSM were surveyed. The re-\nsults included information on employment, wages, and value added,\nwhich were used to compile the nonsubsistence component of the\nGDP. With regard to the subsistence component of the economy, NSO\n(1998) states:\n\u201cThe value of agricultural and fisheries output produced and\nconsumed by the same household was estimated for each of the four\nFSM states as follows:\n(cid:127) The population in 1996 was estimated;\n(cid:127) The level of food imports was estimated for 1996 (Kosrae has\nthe only data, the value was estimated for the other states);\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 83 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "84 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n(cid:127) The daily per capita value of food imports was calculated and\nconverted to daily per capita number of calories (2,258 calories\nper dollar of imported food);\n(cid:127) Assuming the per capita calories consumed in FSM is 2,400,\nthis equals imported calories (given above) plus calories which\nare obtained from local foods;\n(cid:127) By assuming that the calories per dollar of local food is 1,577, a\ntotal dollar value of local food consumed per capita can be\nobtained.\u201d\nThe consultants were advised that the SAM prepared by EMPAT\nused 1998 GDP data from the public enterprise accounts for large-\nscale fishing and processing. Data from a household survey were\nused to measure the contribution of the small-scale commercial\nfishing. EMPAT staff has confirmed that the SAM only includes\nestimates for the cash part of the economy and does not include\nsubsistence.\nOther studies of the fishing or fisheries industry have been un-\ndertaken, including (i) Petersen (2001) who cites a variety of sources\nand indicates that the \u201cfishing industry\u201d was responsible for 15.5%\nof the FSM GDP in 1990, and (ii) World Bank (1995) which stated\nthat, in 1996, \u201cfisheries\u201d was responsible for 6.0% of the FSM GDP.\nGiven the history of poor quality data and the limited resources\nthat have been committed to improving the quality of the data, it is\ndifficult to give much credibility to the available estimates of fishing\ncontribution to GDP.\nComments on the GDP Calculation\nThe World Bank\u2019s 1996 estimate:\n(cid:127) The documentation supporting the NSO estimate of GDP pro-\nvides a concise outline of the approach used to measure GDP,\nbut it does not provide details of the actual calculations.

In constant 1989 prices, the contribution in\n1999 was around F$48.9 million, which is about 34.0% higher than\nthe official estimate.\nBackground\nThe Bureau of Statistics calculates the GDP estimates for the Fiji\nIslands. The various components of fisheries are not reported sepa-\nrately in the published estimates of GDP in current prices. Subsistence\nfishing is included in the overall \u201cSubsistence\u201d sector.

According to that document, \u201cthe fishing industry is di-\nvided into four sectors:\u201d\n(cid:127) Industrial fishery\u2014operates on a large scale and is export\noriented.\n(cid:127) Artisanal fishery\u2014comprises small-scale commercial production.\n(cid:127) Subsistence fishery\u2014the production-cum-consumption sector.\n(cid:127) Aquaculture\u2014largely experimental.\nIn practice, the calculation of the fishing contribution is limited\nto the industrial fishery and the artisanal fishery. The contribution of\nthe subsistence fishery is included as part of the overall contribution\nof subsistence. Currently, the contribution of aquaculture is trivial,\nand it is ignored in the calculations.\nThe contributions of industrial and artisanal fishing have been\nestimated using a production approach. In the case of the industrial\nfishing, the gross output and intermediate cost data were obtained\nfrom a survey of the large-scale fishing companies. The contribution\nof artisanal fishing was estimated from information obtained in a\nsurvey of commercial fishers and data from loan applications made\nto the Fiji Development Bank.\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 87 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "88 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\nThe contribution of subsistence fishing to GDP is included in\nthe Bureau\u2019s estimate of the contribution of overall subsistence pro-\nduction. The calculation is based upon data collected in the 1991\nhousehold expenditure survey. The survey collected aggregate data\nand it is not possible to single out the fishing component.\nOfficials at the Bureau of Statistics advised that it was not cur-\nrently possible to separate the contribution of fish processing from\nthe \u201cManufacturing \u2013 Other Food Industries\u201d category.\nComments on the GDP Calculation\nAt least in theory, the methods used by the Bureau of Statistics\nto measure the contributions of industrial fishery and artisanal fishery\nto GDP should produce reasonable estimates of the sectors\u2019 contribu-\ntion to GDP. The results, however, suggest that they are significantly\nundervaluing the contributions.\nOne important issue is the valuation of gross output. The com-\npleteness of the fish export data is suspect. The primary source for\nexport data is the Customs records, which understate the export\nquantity and value. Discussions with Customs officials indicate that,\nsince there are no revenue or enforcement issues associated with\nexports, they have little incentive to ensure the records are accurate.\nIn particular, the prices quoted on export invoices understate the\nprice that is eventually received. Exporters are required to indicate\nthe price received for their product on the export documentation\nprior to shipping. Since the eventual sale price is unknown at the\ntime of export, the figures recorded are not correct. Not surprisingly,\nmost exporters usually record a conservative price on their export\ndocumentation. This understated price is the price that is recorded\nin the statistical database. Needless to say, the combination of a low\nprice and inaccurate quantities results in a markedly lower gross\noutput value and, hence, an underestimate of the subsector\u2019s contri-\nbution to GDP.\nThe ratios of intermediate consumption to gross output being\nused by the Bureau were obtained from surveys of the large-scale\nfishing enterprises and from field interviews of medium- and small-\nscale fishers. The large-scale fishing enterprises are involved in the\noffshore fishery. The value-added ratio derived for this sector is 53.5%.\nThis ratio appears to be a little high when compared to the informa-\ntion in reports on the fishery in the Fiji Islands and elsewhere. Both\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 88 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 89\nAppendix 1 89\nmedium-scale and small-scale fishing identified in the report supply\nthe local market and collect marine products for processing and ex-\nport. Bureau officials advised that the two activities were differenti-\nated by the nature of their customer base and the type of associated\nfacilities involved in the activity. Medium-scale fishing is a full-time\nactivity that typically supplied fresh fish to established retail outlets\nand usually maintained cold storage facilities. The value-added ra-\ntio for this activity was assessed to be 54.7%. This ratio is slightly\nlower than that indicated in other comparative data. The small-scale\nfishing activity included occasional fishing and those fishers that\ntypically sold their catch at the local market or on the side of the\nroad. Normally, this activity does not have associated cold storage\nfacilities. The survey produced a value-added ratio of 55.5%. This\nratio is close to the mean of the values indicated by other sources.\nRevised Estimates of GDP\nOffshore locally-based fishing:\n5,500 mt * F$9,200 * 0.50 = F$25,300,000\nSource of data: Production and price information as per Appendix 2.

However, given the\nsubstantial differences between the estimates, most of the variation\nis attributable to differing estimates of the levels of production in the\nfishing sector.\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 90 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 91\nAppendix 1 91\nBackground\nThe Government\u2019s Statistics Office prepares the GDP estimates\nfor Kiribati. The most recent estimates available to the consultants\nare the unpublished information in Table A1. 8, which was prepared\nby the Statistics Office.\nDue to problems with the airline service to Tarawa, the consult-\nants were unable to visit Kiribati. The data used in the following\ndiscussion were obtained from an adviser to the Ministry of Finance,\nthe consultants\u2019 own library, and other secondary sources.\nMethods used to Calculate Contribution to GDP\nThe contribution of fishing to GDP is separated into two sub-\nsectors: commercial fishing and subsistence fishing.\n(cid:127) Commercial Fishing. This category covers the fish that are caught\nfor sale. The consultants were advised that the calculation used\nto determine the value added by commercial fishing was based\non informal surveys of the number of fish ice-boxes on the side\nof the road in South Tarawa. Statistics Office staff occasionally\ncount the number of boxes; they then impute the amount of fish\nin each box and multiply the estimated volume of fish by an\nassumed average price. Estimated input costs are then deducted\nto arrive at the value added to GDP.\n(cid:127) Subsistence Fishing. The contribution to GDP is calculated by\ntaking the household expenditure figures from household ex-\npenditure surveys. In years for which there are no household\nexpenditure surveys, the contribution is extrapolated by the\npopulation increase.\nComments on the GDP Calculation\nThe method used to calculate the contribution of commercial fish-\ning to GDP is indirect and unreliable. In addition, if that is the sole\nmethod used, the value added by seaweed, aquarium fish, and other\nmarine products are not included.\nThere have been a number of studies into the production of fish\nand marine products in Kiribati (see Appendix 2). In all cases, these\nstudies indicate levels of production that markedly exceed the\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 91 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "92 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\nproduction level implicit in the official figures. The values of sea-\nweed production and other marine products are reported in the\nGovernment\u2019s 1998 Economic Statement (National Economic Plan-\nning Office [NEPO] 1999). Annual data on these activities should be\navailable and relatively easy to collect from exporters. In the circum-\nstances, it seems highly likely that the official figures underestimate\nthe contribution of commercial fishing to GDP, and that these esti-\nmates could be relatively easily improved.\nWhile the approach to measuring the contribution of subsistence\nfishing is reasonable, it is based on dated information and produc-\ntion is imputed from consumption data. There is a significant body\nof literature that measures the volume of subsistence production (see\nAppendix 2), which could be used to prepare a more reliable esti-\nmate of the sector\u2019s contribution to GDP. It should be a relatively\nstraightforward process to calculate the contribution from existing\nproduction estimates and contemporary price data.\nThe production approach could be used to estimate intertem-\nporal changes in fishing contribution to GDP. This could be done by\nimputing per capita consumption figures from production data and\npopulation statistics for each year. The consumption rate could then\nbe used with changes in population to extrapolate the commercial\nfishing and subsistence fishing contribution to GDP. This approach\nis similar to the method used when extrapolating HIES data by popu-\nlation. While analysts often have little, if any, alternative, it does\nimply the assumption that the consumption/production rate remains\nconstant over time. It remains axiomatic that better data enable bet-\nter estimates to be made. In part, this could be addressed by improv-\ning the interchange of information between the Statistics Office and\nthe Fisheries Division. Ideally, more frequent HIES and fisheries sec-\ntor studies should be carried out.\nRevised Estimates of GDP\nCommercial fishing:\nGeneral 6,000 mt * A$2,100 * 0.65 = A$8,190,000\nAquarium fish: A$1,800,000 * 0.80 = A$1,440,000\nSeaweed: A$210,000 * 0.90 = A$189,000\nSource of data: Production and price information as per Appendix 2.

The consultants\u2019 estimate is lower by\n50% than the official estimate. It appears that the official estimates\nhave not taken into account the fact that the offshore foreign vessels\nthat had been operating in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI)\ndeparted before the end of 1998 (Marshall Islands Marine Resources\nAuthority [MIMRA] 2000). While these vessels were operating in\nthe RMI, they added around US$3.4 million to GDP.\nBackground\nThe Government\u2019s Office of Planning and Statistics prepares\nthe national accounts for the RMI. The methods used to prepare the\nnational accounts are based upon a report prepared by the Forum\nSecretariat in 1992. The national accounts section of the latest Sta-\ntistical Abstract (Office of Planning and Statistics 2000a) states that\n\u201cthe estimates for 1991 and 1992 prepared by a Forum Secretariat\nconsultant are based on the value-added approach. For this exer-\ncise, an establishment survey as well as a housing survey [sic] were\nconducted for gathering the necessary data on various sectors of the\neconomy and the information obtained in this manner was used in\nthe GDP estimates. The estimates for 1993 through 1995 are based\non the value-added approach following the methodology of the Fo-\nrum Secretariat, with revisions where appropriate.\u201d\nMethods used to Calculate Contribution to GDP\nThe Office of Planning and Statistics provided considerable in-\nformation on calculating the fisheries component of GDP, including\na two-page information sheet on the methods used. The sector is\ndivided into four subsectors:\n(cid:127) Large-scale Fishing. This sector includes the offshore fishing\nvessels. At various times in the past, large numbers of foreign\nfishing vessels, notably from Taipei,China, have operated out of\nRMI. While these vessels were operating out of the RMI, it was\nappropriate to include them in fishing\u2019s estimated contribution\nto GDP. At present, there is no locally-based large-scale fishing\nactivity in the RMI.\n(cid:127) Small-scale Commercial Fishing. Small-scale commercial fish-\ning activities include the supply of fish to the local market and\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 94 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 95\nAppendix 1 95\nthe production of some other marine products. It is carried out\nthroughout most of the islands of the RMI. According to\nMIMRA, about half of the activity is attributable to boats oper-\nating through the MIMRA outer islands project.\n(cid:127) Pet Fish Harvest. The export of aquarium fish (pet fish) and\nassociated marine organisms is a significant business in the RMI.\n(cid:127) Subsistence Fishing. Since the departure of the offshore commer-\ncial vessels, subsistence fishing has become the single largest con-\ntributor to the fishing sector of GDP. The collection of marine\nproducts is particularly important in the outer islands where\nthey provide a substantial proportion of household diets.\nComments on the GDP Calculation\nThe estimates of the contribution of large-scale fishing to GDP\nare complicated by the involvement of foreign-owned offshore fish-\ning companies. The Ting Hong company operation in the mid-1990s\nis an example. For several years, Ting Hong managed a fleet of\nchartered Chinese vessels operating out of the RMI. The operation\nwas clearly based in the RMI for over 12 months, and the official\nGDP estimates follow the System of National Accounts (SNA) con-\nvention by including the wages paid to all crew (domestic and for-\neign) and the surplus generated by the operation. It appears that,\ndespite the departure of these vessels before the end of 1998, the\nofficial GDP figures continue to report a substantial contribution\nfrom the vessels in 1999.\nThe contribution of small-scale commercial fishing is calculated\nfrom the records of the MIMRA\u2019s outer islands project. However,\nMIMRA advised the consultants that the catch going through this\nproject is only about half the fish caught/sold in the RMI by small-\nscale fishers. Therefore, the calculated contribution understates the\nvalue-added by small-scale commercial fishing.\nThere is a risk that the calculation of the subsistence fishing\ncontribution to GDP may double-count the catch of small-scale\ncommercial fishing. This catch of the small-scale commercial fishing\noperations is primarily sold in the RMI where it is consumed in house-\nholds. It is therefore quite possible that the fish measured as part of\nthe catch is also measured as part of consumption.\nThe Office of Planning and Statistics worksheet on methods used\nto calculate the contribution of subsistence fishing shows the pro-\nduction of fish in 1996 to be 3,185,928 pounds. This appears to be\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 95 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "96 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\nthe actual weight of the food (i.e., not the whole fish weight). If so, it\nwould equate to a per capita fish consumption of about 59.0 kg per\nyear. This amount does not seem unreasonable. It is similar to the\nconsumption levels measured in neighboring countries with similar\nconditions to the RMI.\nA large-scale loining operation started in Majuro in October\n1999. It has been reported that this operation is paying as much as\nUS$85,000 per month in wages (MIMRA 2000). Under the standard\nSNA convention, the value added by the loining operation would\nnormally be allocated to the food-processing sector. However, given\nthe small size of the nonfish food processing industry in the RMI\nand the direct link between the loining plant and the fishing industry,\nit could be useful to identify it as a fisheries activity and classify it in\nthe national accounts as a separate sub-industry under \u201cManufactur-\ning.\u201d Given that the loining operation is not classified under \u201cFishing,\u201d\nits contribution to GDP has not been included in the consultants\u2019\nrevised estimate of GDP.\nAlso, a considerable amount of fish is transshipped from for-\neign vessels in the RMI. Transshipment is not a fishing activity and\nthe value added accruing from the activity is correctly allocated to\nother sectors of the economy including \u201cTransport,\u201d \u201cWholesale and\nRetail,\u201d and \u201cHotels.\u201d\nRevised Estimates of GDP\nLarge-scale fishing:\n\u2014nil\u2014\nSource of data: Production and price information as per Appendix 2.\nIncludes foreign-owned offshore fishing, where the operation is based in\nthe RMI.

Production data is derived from\ntwo main sources: (i) the back-calculation of MIMRA gross output and price\nrecords, and (ii) estimates made by various production surveys (Dalzell et al.\n1996).\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 96 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 97\nAppendix 1 97\nAquarium fish (Pet-fish):\nUS$473,000 * 0.50 = US$236,500\nSource of data: Production and price information as per Appendix 2. The\nvalue-added ratio used is the same as that used in the official figures. It\nis noted that the ratio gives a substantially lower value-added than that\nreported in the Cook Islands where the value-added ratio for aquarium fish\ncollection is 0.80. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the con-\nsultants considered it prudent to use the figure adopted in the official RMI\ncalculations.\nSubsistence fishing:\n2,800 mt * US$1,370 * 0.80 = US$3,068,800\nSource of data: Production and price information as per Appendix 2. A straight\nproduction approach has been used to avoid the possibility of double count-\ning small-scale commercial fishing and subsistence fishing.

While this figure is markedly higher than the offi-\ncial estimate, it is noted that methods used by Statistics New Zealand\nare valid and appropriate. The principal difference is in the value\nattributed to the coastal commercial fishing. The consultants have used\na production approach and with a markedly higher average price\nthan that applicable to the coastal subsistence subsector. It is possible\nthat the income tax data used to make the official estimates were\nincomplete or understated.\nBackground\nThe Niue GDP for the years 1997\u20132000 are calculated by\nStatistics New Zealand in 2000 (Lewington 2000). A combination of\nproduction and income approaches is used, and the results are cate-\ngorized by ownership and industry group. Statistics New Zealand\nwas thorough and took particular account of the role and impor-\ntance of fishing in Niue.\nThe published national accounts are highly aggregated with fish-\ning being included in the \u201cAgriculture, Hunting, Fishing and For-\nestry\u201d sector of the industry group and \u201cPrivate Sector Subsistence\u201d\nof the ownership group.\nThe insignificant amount of on-shore handling or processing is\ndistributed through several sectors in the industry group and the\n\u201cPrivate Enterprises in the Formal Cash\u201d sector of the ownership\ngroup. Given the small amount of added value that would be attrib-\nutable to the nonfishing fisheries activities, it is not worth the effort\nrequired to undertake a separate analysis.\nMethods used to Calculate Contribution to GDP\nThe fishing sector is divided in two subsectors:\n(cid:127) Coastal Subsistence Fishing. This includes subsistence and\nnonmarket production.\n(cid:127) Coastal Commercial Fishing. This includes small-scale commer-\ncial fishing and some sport fishing.\nThe valuation of the coastal subsistence fishing component of GDP\nis based upon a survey of 20 households (3.6% of all households in\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 100 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 101\nAppendix 1 101\nNiue) that was carried out in June 2000. The results from the survey\nwere extrapolated by the population to estimate the overall con-\nsumption. This survey indicated that the annual catch from\nsubsistence fisheries was 194 mt. The price of each fishery product\nin the diet was gathered from the local market, and the calculated\ngross value of output was NZ$315,640. Gross value was discounted\nby 20\u201330% to arrive at a \u201cfarm gate\u201d price. The \u201cfarm gate\u201d value\nwas then multiplied by 0.65 to arrive at the value added by the\nsubsector.\nThe data used to value the coastal commercial fishing subsector\nwere derived from income tax returns. The few businesses engaged\nin fishing also provide fishing charters. Income from tourism is in-\ncluded in the estimate since it is not possible to separate the income\nand costs of the tourists operation from the purely fishing income.\nComments on the GDP Calculation\nAs stated in the supporting documentation (Lewington 2000):\nThe methods used to measure the subsistence economy are spelt out\nin some detail. Subjective judgment played a major part in these esti-\nmates. Users of these National Accounts need to be aware of the as-\nsumptions and may wish to adjust them in accordance with their\nown view on subsistence consumption and its valuation.\nGiven the inherent uncertainties in the process, the assumptions\nused appear reasonable.\nThe official estimate of annual subsistence catch of 194 mt is\nsomewhat higher than that reported by (i) Dalzell et al. (1996) sub-\nsistence estimate of 103 mt; and (ii) the estimate of 120 mt for all\nNiue fisheries used by the Niue Department of Agriculture, Forestry\nand Fisheries (B. Pasisi, pers. com. June 2001).\nThe income method used to calculate the contribution from\ncoastal commercial fishing is valid given that the analyst had access\nto income tax records. This approach relies upon the accuracy of the\nincome tax records. There is a risk that the production estimate for\ncoastal subsistence fishing might double count the coastal commer-\ncial catch. This could happen if the household consumption data\nused to calculate the coastal subsistence production include the fish\npurchased from commercial operators. It is noted that, given the\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 101 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "102 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\nrelatively small contribution attributed to the commercial subsector,\nany double counting is probably not significant.\nRevised Estimates of GDP\nCoastal subsistence fishing:\n194 mt * NZ$1,650 * 0.65 = NZ$208,065\nSource of data: Production and price information as per Appendix 2. The\nprice estimates assume that the catch includes a significant proportion of\nshellfish and other relatively low value species. While the subsistence fish-\ning includes low input reef gleaning and nonmotorized fishing, a relatively\nhigh proportion of the fishing is high input motorized trolling.

In subsequent years, the Economic and Social Commis-\nsion for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), IMF, UNDP, and the Office of\nPlanning and Statistics have each prepared GDP estimates. The\nmethods and approaches used have varied, sometimes markedly.\nOne consequence of these differences has been the wide variation in\nestimates of the contribution of fishing to the Palau economy. The\nestimates range from a high of 28.8% in 1992 (from a development\nplan cited in Lambeth [1999] and Bishop et al. [1995]) to a low of\n2.7% in 1998 (Office of Planning and Statistics 2000c).\nIn the circumstance, it would be unwise to give much credence\nto inter-temporal comparisons of fisheries contribution to GDP in\nPalau.\nMethods used to Calculate Contribution to GDP\nUnlike the situation for most Pacific Island countries where fish-\ning is combined with agriculture and other primary industries, the\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 103 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "104 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\nnational accounts prepared by the Office of Planning and Statistics\nshow \u201cFisheries\u201d as a separate sector. In the case of Palau, the term\n\u201cFisheries\u201d is taken to be analogous to \u201cFishing\u201d as defined in the\nSNA.\nIn calculating the contribution of fishing to GDP, the Office of\nPlanning and Statistics divided the sector into three categories:\n(cid:127) Corporate Sector (of which offshore and large-scale commer-\ncial fishing is a component). The Office of Planning and Statis-\ntics used a combination of income and expenditure approaches\nto value the fisheries component of the corporate sector. The\ndata used were collected directly from the larger fishing com-\npanies.\n(cid:127) Small-scale Commercial Fishing. Wage information obtained\nfrom the social security register was used to calculate the value\nadded to GDP by small-scale commercial fishing.\n(cid:127) Subsistence Fishing. The contribution of subsistence fishing has\nbeen calculated by multiplying the number of people who iden-\ntified themselves as fishers in the national census by the amount\nof US$2,000.\nComments on the GDP Calculation\nThe approach used to calculate the contribution of the corporate\nsector works well in situations where the enterprises keep accurate\nrecords, and it is possible to identify and survey the enterprises in-\nvolved in fishing. The reason for the substantial difference between\nthe consultants\u2019 estimate and the official estimate is not clear.\nThe methods used to calculate the contribution of both the small-\nscale commercial fishing and subsistence fishing are probably less accu-\nrate. It is unlikely that wages recorded in the social security register\naccount for all the value added to GDP by small-scale commercial\nfishing. A significant proportion of the payments to crew is probably\nin cash and, therefore, not recorded in the register. In addition, when\nusing the income approach to calculate the value added to GDP, the\ncalculation should include employee remuneration (wages), operat-\ning surplus and the consumption of fixed capital.\nThe estimated contribution of the subsistence fishing category\nis based on what appears to be an arbitrary value per capita of\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 104 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 105\nAppendix 1 105\nUS$2,000 for each fisher (as identified in the census). The empirical\nbasis for the US$2,000 is not clear, although it is noted that the con-\ntribution to GDP calculated using this approach is close to that cal-\nculated by the consultants using the production approach.\nGiven that production data are available for the Palau inshore\nand offshore fisheries (Palau Conservation Society [PCS] 2000 and\nexport permits) and the fact that domestic and export prices are\nreasonably well documented, a production approach is likely to pro-\nduce a more reliable measure of fisheries contribution to GDP for\nthe small-scale commercial and subsistence fisheries.\nRevised Estimates of GDP\nCorporate sector:\n2,500 mt * US$6,080 * 0.50 = US$7,600,000\nSource of data: Production and price information as per Appendix 2. The\nvalue-added ratio of 0.50 is derived from consultations with an SPC master\nfisherman and the analysis of various reports in which income and expendi-\nture records for commercial vessels are detailed.\nThere are marked swings in the level of corporate fishing activ-\nity between years. Up to 600 foreign longline boats have been based\nin Palau at times during the 1990s; while in other years there has\nbeen virtually no locally-based foreign vessels. The production of\nthese foreign-owned vessels should be included in the contribution\nto GDP when they are operating in conjunction with a local com-\npany or are based in Palau for at least 12 months.\nSmall-scale commercial fishing:\n865 mt * US$3,000 * 0.55 = US$1,427,250\nSource of data: Production based on PCS (2000). Price data from PCS\n(2000) and consultants\u2019 estimates. The value-added ratio of 0.55 assumes\nthat most of the small-scale commercial fishing used motorized boats.\nSubsistence fishing:\n1,250 mt * US$2,000 * 0.80 = US$2,000,000\nSource of data: Production as per Appendix 2. The price used is the imputed\nfarm gate price. It has been calculated by deducting 33% from the small-\nscale commercial fishing price. The value-added ratio of 0.80 assumes that\nthe subsistence catch is taken by a mix of gleaning, diving and the use of\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 105 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "106 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\nmotorized boats.

There is also the fisheries-\nrelated category of monetary fishing: commerce.\nThe composition of the sub-categories is as follows:\n(cid:127) Monetary Fishing. This refers to offshore fishing.\n(cid:127) Non-Monetary Fishing. This includes subsistence, nonmarket\nhousehold production, and small-scale commercial fishing.\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 109 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "110 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n(cid:127) Monetary fishing: commerce. This refers to fisheries-related\nactivities such as onshore fish handling, packaging, and trans-\nshipment.\nThe valuation of the contribution of the monetary fishing sector\nuses a production approach. The contribution to GDP is calculated\nby deducting the intermediate costs from the gross output, which is\nthe product of the total production multiplied by the average price.\nSince most of the catch/production from this sector ends up being\nexported, principally to the canneries in Pago Pago, it is relatively\neasy to measure the volume produced and the market price. The\nestimate of costs of intermediate inputs is also reasonably straight-\nforward given the data available on the cost of operating commercial\nfishing vessels, and the costs of handling, packaging and shipping\nin Samoa.\nThe measure of the value added contribution of the nonmonetary\nfishing sector is based on data collected in a study of the sector that\nwas carried out in 2000 (Passfield 2001). That study produced esti-\nmates of the quantity of fish caught and consumed by households,\nand those caught and sold by small-scale commercial fishers. It also\nprovided an estimate of the market value of the product. The results\nof this study have been incorporated into the 2000 national accounts\nand for some earlier years.\nPassfield estimated village fisheries production to be 7,169 mt\nper annum, which comprises 4,293 mt used for home consumption\nand 2,879 mt sold or given away. The small-scale commercial fish-\ning activity is encompassed within village production. Passfield also\nestimated the weighted average market price of small-scale com-\nmercial fisheries production to be ST6.29 per kg. This approach val-\nues home consumption at the market price of the fish. The approach\nis inconsistent with the SNA scheme of valuing goods and services\nthat are consumed by the producer instead of being sold. According\nto the SNA, the \u201cfarm gate\u201d price is more appropriate.\nAccording to SNA, the category monetary fishing: commerce  is\nnot within the sector in SNA known as \u201cfishing,\u201d but it is obviously\nrelated to fisheries.  The contribution of the category is slightly more\ndifficult to estimate. The enterprises engaged in this sector vary con-\nsiderably in size and sophistication making it more difficult to mea-\nsure their production, prices, and intermediate costs. The Treasury\nDepartment faces similar difficulties in measuring the contribution\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 110 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 111\nAppendix 1 111\nof most other sectors in the economy. It has, therefore, elected to use\na variation of the expenditure approach to valuation. Samoa has a\nvalue-added tax (VAT), and all enterprises with an annual gross\nturnover exceeding ST52,000 are obliged to submit two monthly VAT\nreturns. Enterprises are classified by sector, and the VAT payments\nfor each sector summed up. It is then possible to back calculate the\nvalue added by each sector by dividing the total VAT collected from\nthe sector by the VAT rate. Virtually all the enterprises in this cat-\negory are obliged to submit VAT returns and business activity\nreports, so the coverage is quite good. The procedure also has the\nadvantage of relying on a legally enforceable obligation that is im-\nposed on all enterprises.\nComments on the GDP Calculation\nThe production approach that was used to measure the contri-\nbution of monetary fishing is the best available method given the com-\nplex nature of the sector. The fishing sector is notoriously difficult to\nmeasure because:\n(i) There is a usually a wide range in the size of the enterprises\ninvolved;\n(ii) Many participants are owner-operators who sell their catch\nfor cash and do not report their earnings;\n(iii) Even when crew are employed, they often work for a \u201cshare of\nthe catch,\u201d the amount of which can vary markedly depending\nupon the amount they contribute to the operating costs.\nIn the circumstances, the income or expenditure approaches to\nthe valuation of GDP are not usually feasible. Their coverage is in-\ncomplete and, even where an enterprise is covered, the valuation of\noutput is difficult. A production approach that relies on secondary\ndata sources such as shipping records, international prices, and\nmarket surveys is likely to produce more reliable data.\nThe procedure used to measure the nonmonetary fishing contri-\nbution to GDP is appropriate. The only additional points worth con-\nsidering are:\n(i) The segregation of small-scale commercial fishing from the\nsubsistence component of village fishing. The Passfield re-\nport identifies the share of village production going to own\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 111 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "112 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\nconsumption and the share that is sold or given away. This\ndistinction could be used as the boundary between subsistence\nfishing and small-scale commercial fishing.\n(ii) Given that much of the subsistence production is from glean-\ning the reef and inshore fishing while much of the small-scale\ncommercial fishing uses boats many of which have motors,\nthere is a marked difference in the level of intermediate costs\nbetween the two activities. Splitting the village fisheries into\ntwo sub-categories\u2014subsistence and small-scale commercial\u2014\nwould enable a more accurate calculation of value added.\n(iii) The price used to value nonmonetary production is the esti-\nmated weighted average market price of total production. It is\nworth considering to use a farm gate price for own consump-\ntion given that the value to the household is the market price\nless the cost of transport and marketing.\nThe monetary fishing: commerce subsector mainly comprises the\nmedium to large enterprises involved in the onshore handling, pack-\ning, and shipping of fish for export. In most national accounts, the\nvalue added from these activities is usually distributed between a\nnumber of other sectors including food processing, transport, whole-\nsale and retail. The decision to show these separately provides a\nbetter insight into the importance of fishing and fisheries to the\neconomy of Samoa.\nThe use of VAT returns and business activity returns to measure\nthe contribution of these enterprises can be an effective method of\nmeasuring their contribution to GDP. However, this method is only\nfeasible where VAT or a similar consumption tax is imposed and\nwhere business activity returns are collected and analyzed. The ef-\nfectiveness of the method relies on a thorough coverage of the enter-\nprises operating in the sector. This may not always be the case, espe-\ncially given that small enterprises may not be obliged to submit VAT\nreturns. In the case of Samoa, it seems that most of the commercial\noperators are submitting returns. So the method provides an effec-\ntive way of measuring the value added of the subsector.\nRevised Estimates of GDP\nMonetary tuna fishing:\n5,156 mt * ST5,769 * 0.50 = ST14,872,482\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 112 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 113\nAppendix 1 113\nSource of data: Production and price information as per Appendix 2.\nProduction: 5,156 mt total tuna catch of Alia catamaran longline fleet in 1999\nas reported by Watt and Moala (2000), Watt (2001), Sua and Watt (2001).\nPrice: Weighted average of tuna shipped to Pago Pago canneries (3,370 mt\n* ST5,400/mt FOB) and tuna airfreighted for the sashimi market (1,037mt *\nST9,000/mt) and local sales/gifts (749 mt * ST2.96/mt).\nSubsistence fishing:\n4,293 mt * ST5,030 * 0.90 = ST19,434,411\nSource of data: Production and price information as per Appendix 2.\nSmall-scale commercial fishing:\n3,086 mt * ST6,448 * 0.60 = ST11,939,117\nSource of data: Production and price information as per Appendix 2.\nMonetary fishing: commerce:\n(no independent estimate) = ST18,858,000\nAlthough the Samoan authorities explicitly recognize the importance of the\ncommercial activities associated with fishing by estimating its contribution\nseparately from other commerce activities, these activities are not part of the\n\u201cfishing\u201d sector and are not included in the table below.\nThis can be summarized and compared to the official estimate:\nTable A1.20: Official vs. Re-estimates of GDP and\nFishing Contribution of Samoa, 1999\n(ST)\nItem Official GDP Consultants Revised\n Estimate Estimate\nGDP (current market prices) 705,914,000 695,763,630\nFishing Contribution to GDP 56,399,000 46,246,010\nGDP = gross domestic product; ST = tala.\nSources: Treasury Department (2000); Consultants\u2019 estimates.\nSolomon Islands\nThe Nominal Contribution of Fishing to GDP\nThe following tables present three separate series of GDP esti-\nmates including:\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 113 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "114 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\n(i) the Bank of Hawaii\u2019s (BoH) estimates of nominal GDP from\n1993 to 1997 (BoH 1998);\n(ii) ADB\u2019s estimates of real GDP from 1993 to 1999 (ADB 2000b);\nand\n(iii) the Central Bank of the Solomon Islands (CBSI) estimate of\nfishing contribution to GDP (CBSI 2000).\nTable A1.21: Bank of Hawaii\u2019s Estimates of Nominal GDP\nof Solomon Islands, 1993\u20131997\n(SI$\u2019000)\nItem 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997\nGDP (current market prices) 755,300 879,300 1,059,300 1,225,800 1,352,700\nGDP = gross domestic product; SI$ = Solomon Islands dollar.\nSource: Bank of Hawaii, 1998.\nTable A1.22: ADB\u2019s Estimates of Real GDP and\nFishing Contribution of Solomon Islands, 1993\u20131999\n(US$)\nItem 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999\nReal GDP\n(1985 prices) 268,800 282,800 301,700 312,300 309,200 302,400 305,400\nMonetary Fishing\nContribution 13,800 17,400 24,200 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nMonetary Fishing\nContribution (%) 5.1 6.2 8.0 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nNonmonetary Food\nContribution a 41,400 42,500 43,600 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nADB = Asian Development Bank; GDP = gross domestic product; SI$ = Solomon Islands dollar.\na Nonmonetary fishing is included in the non-monetary food category; the disaggregated contribution\nof nonmonetary fishing is not available.

The consultants\u2019 estimate is\nhigher than the official estimate by about 5.0%.\nSubsequent to preparing this analysis, the consultants were\nadvised that the GDP estimates for Tonga had been re-estimated. In\nthe re-estimates, the fishing contribution has been reduced to\nT$16,915,600. Perusal of the data shows that the principal differ-\nence between the consultants\u2019 estimate and the new estimate pre-\npared by the Statistics Department is in the value added by exports.\nIn their re-estimation of the fishing contribution, the Department\ncontinues to rely upon official export statistics. As discussed else-\nwhere in this report, the consultants believe that the official export\nstatistics understate the gross value of exports.\nBackground\nThe Statistics Department has published provisional estimates\nof Tonga\u2019s GDP for the financial years from 1993/94 to 1999/00\n(Statistics Department 2000a). Officials of the Statistics Department\nalso provided the consultants with a photocopied worksheet that\nshows the breakdown of Agriculture/Forestry/Fisheries sector into\nits component parts. This breakdown shows the contribution of the\nlocally marketed, nonmarketed, and exports subsectors to GDP for\n1999/00. The contributions are as follows: T$9,090,000 for locally\nmarketed; T$5,108,000 for nonmarketed; and T$3,701,000 for fish\nexports.\nMethods used to Calculate Contribution to GDP\nThe categories used by the Statistics Department are:\n(cid:127) Locally Marketed. This category covers the fish that are caught\nfor sale as food. The Statistics Department indicated that a pro-\nduction approach is used to estimate the value added by the\nlocally marketed subsector. The initial data were obtained by\nsurveying some private businesses. This value is updated by\nextrapolation based on population, consumer price index (CPI),\nand disaster index. Twenty percent of the gross value is sub-\ntracted to cover intermediate costs.\n(cid:127) Nonmarketed. This category covers the fish and aquatic prod-\nucts that are harvested for household use. The value added is\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 118 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 119\nAppendix 1 119\nimputed from information obtained in a 1993/94 HIES. In the\nyears since the HIES, the estimated GDP contributions have been\nderived by extrapolation based on population, CPI, and disaster\nindex. As with the locally marketed fish, 20% is deducted from\nthe gross output to cover intermediate costs.\n(cid:127) Export. The export contribution to estimated GDP comes from\nthe Reserve Bank exports statistics. According to the Statistics\nDepartment, the total value of fisheries exports is reduced by\n35% to account for costs of intermediate inputs.\nThe Statistics Department also advised that there is very little\nfish processing carried out in Tonga and to the extent that the fish is\nprocessed before consumption, sale or export, the added value would\nbe incorporated in the above three subsectors.\nComments on the GDP Calculation\nThe estimate of the nonmarket contribution to GDP relies on the\nextrapolation of data collected almost a decade ago. In addition,\nthe results of the survey have not been published so it is difficult\nto crosscheck the accuracy of the base data against other data\nsources.\nThe accuracy of the factors used to adjust for the cost of inter-\nmediate inputs could be improved with some input from the fishing\nsector. The figures used for market fishing (20%) and export (35%)\nappear low, while the nonmarket factor (20%) appears high.\nAdvice from the Tonga Fish Exporters Association indicates that\nthe value of exported fishery products is about three times that shown\nin the Reserve Bank reports (Appendix 2). The export data used by\nthe Reserve Bank is taken from packing lists, while the information\nfrom the exporter association is based on the audited accounts of\nthe major finfish exporters. The price used by the Reserve Bank in its\ncalculation is T$5.67 per kg, whereas that largest exporter indicates\nthat they receive an average price of T$7.35 per kg free on board\n(FOB) for exports. Closer consultation between the authorities re-\nsponsible for the preparation of the estimates, i.e., the Ministry of\nFisheries and the industry, could help improve the accuracy of the\nestimated contribution of exports to GDP.\nIt is unclear whether \u201cfish\u201d exports encompass all living marine\nresources. The Ministry of Fishery Annual Report\u2019s estimate of ex-\nports includes shark fins, aquarium fish and related products, and\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 119 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "120 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\nseaweed. These should be included in the estimated contribution of\nthe sector to GDP.\nIt appears that the Ministry of Fisheries has little input into or\ninfluence over the estimation of fishing contribution to GDP.

They were prepared with the assistance of an economic con-\nsultant from Statistics New Zealand. The approach and assumptions\nused are outlined in the National Accounts 1996 to 1998 Report and\nthe associated Technical Report (Lewington 1999b).\nMethods used to Calculate Contribution to GDP\nThe contribution of \u201cFishing\u201d to GDP in current prices for 1998\nis shown as A$66,000 and A$1,426,200 for market and nonmarket\nproduction, respectively.\nTo calculate the contribution of fishing to GDP, the analyst\ndivided the sector into two principal categories and three sub-\ncategories:\n(cid:127) Market Production. This category covers the fish that are caught\nfor sale as food. The calculation assumes that the government-\nowned fishing company, National Fishing Corporation of Tuvalu\n(NAFICOT), catches 100% of the fish sold commercially. The\nvalue-added ratio of 0.55 used in the calculation is derived from\nNAFICOT records.\n(cid:127) Nonmarket Production. Nonmarket fishing includes three sub-\ncategories:\n(i) Subsistence Fishing. The contribution of subsistence fishing\nis calculated from data on household fish consumption and\nmarket prices. The data distinguish between consumption\nrate and price levels in Funafuti and in the outer islands.\n\u2013 Funafuti:\nAverage daily household consumption\u20141.34 kg\nMarket price\u2014A$2.20 per kg\nValue-added ratio\u20140.85\n\u2013 Outer islands:\nAverage daily household consumption\u20141.14 kg\nMarket price\u2014A$1.50 per kg\nValue-added ratio\u20140.90\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 122 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 123\nAppendix 1 123\n(ii) Marine Products. Marine products include a range of items\ntaken for subsistence and used to produce handicrafts. The\ncalculation assumes that marine products add the equiva-\nlent of 10% of the sum of the contribution of market and\nsubsistence to GDP.\n(iii) Fish Curing. Fish curing is an activity carried out in the\nouter islands where it is not possible to refrigerate fish.\nThe calculation used assumes that the amount of fish cured\nadds the equivalent of 15% of the contribution of subsis-\ntence to GDP.\nComments on the GDP Calculation\nThe calculation of the value added by market production uses\nthe accounts of NAFICOT to provide values of gross output.  There\nis very little information available on the quantity of fish caught\nwithin Tuvalu. NAFICOT has information on fish caught from its\nown fishing activities, but this does not include the quantity of fish\ncaught by private fishers for commercial purposes. The value-added\nratio of 0.55 may be appropriate for the NAFICOT operation, but it\nseems low for other private fishers, many of whom use hand lines\noff the reef edge. In the circumstances, it seems likely that the esti-\nmate of value added by market production is an underestimate of\nthe contribution to GDP.\nThe method used to calculate the contribution of subsistence is\nreasonable given the data available. It relies upon the assumption\nthat households in Tuvalu consume the same amount of fish every\nyear and that the estimates in the HIES are accurate. The consult-\nants have adopted the figures used.\nThe marine products subsector includes oysters, seaweed, crabs,\nlobsters, and seashells. Although the documentation does not specify\nthis, it is assumed that this subsector accounts for all the nonfinfish\ntaken by subsistence fishing. The empirical basis for the 10% addi-\ntional value added is not specified. Since these products normally\nconstitute part of the fish catch, they are probably better treated as\npart of overall subsistence fishing production.\nFish curing is carried out in the outer islands where the people\ndo not have access to refrigeration. As with marine products, the\nempirical basis for the 15% additional value added is not specified.\nA conventional production approach would calculate the value\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 123 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "124 The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island Countries\nadded by deducting the cost of intermediate consumption from the\nfarm gate or market price of the cured product. Some data are avail-\nable from a report prepared in 1996 (SCP 1997), which indicates\nthat the breakeven input cost of fish is close to the market price for\nfresh fish. Given this apparent price relationship and the fact that\nfish curing in Tuvalu is fundamentally a food security measure, it is\nreasonable to treat the fish curing as part of overall subsistence.\nCalculating the value added by fish curing would require more\ndetailed information on the market price for cured fish and the vol-\nume produced.\nThere is no provision in the accounts for nongovernment com-\nmercial fishing. While small in context of the overall level of fishing\nactivity, private fishing is significant and should be included in the\nestimate of fishing contribution to GDP.\nRevised Estimates of GDP\nMarket production:\n220 mt * A$2,000 * 0.65 = A$286,000\nSource of data: Production and price information as per Appendix 2.\nIncludes private fishing. The market price used is a weighted average of the\nFunafuti price (0.70 * A$2.20/kg) and the outer island price (0.30 * A$1.50/\nkg). It assumes that 70% of the market production is sold on Funafuti. The\nvalue-added ratio is a weighted average of the NAFICOT value-added ratio\nused in the official calculations (0.55 * (54 mt/220 mt)) and the value-added\nratio for private fishers assumed by the consultants (0.75 * (166 mt/220 mt)).\nNonmarket production:\n(cid:127) Subsistence\n880 mt * A$1,640 * 0.88 = A$1,270,016\nSource of data: Production as per Appendix 2. The price used is a weighted\naverage of the Funafuti price (0.40 * A$2.00/kg) and the outer island price\n(0.60 * A$1.40/kg) weighted by the production in Funafuti and the outer is-\nlands. The value-added ratio of 0.88 is also a weighted average of the Funafuti\nvalue-added (0.40 * 0.85) and the outer islands (0.60 * 0.90). It assumes that\nmost of the subsistence catch is taken by a mix of gleaning and diving, with\nsome being taken from motorized boats (with motorized boats being more\ncommonly used in Funafuti).\nThis can be summarized and compared to the official estimate:\n52512_ADB_Fisheries layout_new.p65 124 7/4/02, 6:59 PM", "References 125\nAppendix 1 125\nTable A1.28:  Official vs. Re-estimates of GDP and\nFishing Contribution of Tuvalu, 1998\n(A$)\nItem Official GDP Consultants Revised\n Estimate GDP Estimate\nGDP (current market prices) 22,044,500 22,108,500\nFishing Contribution to GDP 1,492,200 1,556,016\nA$ = Australian dollar; GDP = gross domestic product.\nSources: Lewington (1999a); Consultants\u2019 estimates.\nVanuatu\nThe Nominal Contribution of Fishing to GDP\nTable A1.29:  Official GDP and Fishing Contribution of\nVanuatu, 1995\u20131999\n(vt million)\nItem 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999\nGDP (current market prices) 25,550 26,711 27,565 29,289 29,206\nCommercial Fishing 149 114 57 37 34\nSubsistence Fishing 216 238 265 239 244\nFishing Contribution to GDP\nBy Value 365 352 322 276 278\nBy Share (%) 1.4 1.3 1.2 0.9 1.0\nGDP = gross domestic product; mn = million; Vt = vatu.\nSources: Ministry of Finance (2000); P.
