INTRODUCTION \n\nNugroho \n\nGovernments  found  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  to  attain  their  targets.  A \ngovernment should declare and develop clearly, as part of its own policy, the targets that \nSOEs have to achieve. This policy should clarify all the objectives of the government and \nits policies to achieve good corporate governance of the SOEs based on their code of \nconduct (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] 2005). \n\nTo encourage SOEs or to fund government projects, the government may provide SOEs \nwith financing directly as part of its investment policy. When financial backing occurs, a \nsupplementary  cost  budget  related  to  public  service  obligations  should  adjust  for  it \n(OECD 2014). In 2015, the Government of Indonesia provided direct capital injections \nreaching Rp64.88 trillion for 43 SOEs (Ministry of Finance of Republic Indonesia 2016). \nFurthermore,  the  Indonesian  government\u2019s  ownership  of  SOEs  reached  Rp1,762.87 \ntrillion or 32.31% of the total assets in the annual financial statement of the Indonesian \ngovernment in 2015 (Ministry of Finance of Republic Indonesia 2016). \n\nThe  previous  studies  by  Li,  Su,  and  Yang  (2012);  Lee,  Walker,  and  Zeng  (2014); \nAlperovych, Hubner, and Lobet (2015); Guan and Yam (2015); Boeing (2016); and Guo, \nGuo, and Jiang (2016) focused either on the impact of state assistance on firms\u2019 non-\nfinancial  performance  or  on  the  impact  of  state  ownership  on  companies\u2019  financial \nperformance.  \n\nThis paper examines the relationship between government support and SOEs\u2019 financial \nperformance.  By  employing  government  support,  it  provides  an  extended  model  to \nmeasure  SOE  performance.  My  empirical  results  show  that  government  support  for \nSOEs  does  not  have  a  significant  effect  on  their  financial  performance.  The  results \nsuggest that the government should take into account its support for SOEs and consider \nalternative solutions to design a proper government support policy to generate higher \nfinancial performance. The government also needs to determine precisely whether it will \nencourage  SOEs  by  increasing  its  investment  in  them  in  the  future  with  the  aim  of \nboosting their performance to meet the government\u2019s service obligations. \n\n2.  LITERATURE REVIEW \n\n2.1  Theoretical Framework \n\nThe existence of SOEs is inseparable from government intervention. As the main owner, \nthe  government  tries  to  manage  SOEs  as  well.  A  proper  government  policy  \nwill  boost  their  performance.  As  the  OECD  (2016)  estimated,  of  the  world\u2019s  largest  \n100  firms,  22%  are  under  government  control.  Hence,  the  presence  of  government \nintervention in the achievement of good performance of SOEs is undeniable. \n\nAccording to Indonesia\u2019s SOE Law Number 19 from 2003, an SOE is a business entity \nof  which  all  or  at  least  51%  is  owned  by  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  through  direct \ninvestment, with the main objective of pursuing profit. Therefore, SOEs in Indonesia are \ndefined as firms of which the government holds at least 51% of the total shares. These \nthe  major  shareholder  \npercentages  of  ownership  show \nof SOEs.  \n\nthe  government  as \n\nBesides being a shareholder, the government plays the role of a stakeholder. In both \nroles,  the  government  requires  the  implementation  of  good  corporate  governance  of \nSOEs. As the OECD (2014) explained, SOEs should fulfill the government\u2019s mandate to \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 983 \n \n\nNugroho \n\ncontribute  and  reallocate  economic  development  programs  through  good  corporate \ngovernance. \n\nAs a guide for the interaction between the government and the SOEs, the relationship \nbetween them should be clear. This does not mean that the government should intervene \nin all the SOEs\u2019 activities. As the OECD (1998) emphasized, it is necessary to clarify and \ncommunicate clearly the relationship between the government and the SOEs, especially \nregarding government objectives, monitoring, and reporting as well as the measurement \nof the positions and performance of SOEs\u2019 directors. The clear relationship between the \ngovernment  and  the  SOEs,  as  the  OECD  (1998)  discussed,  includes  strengthening \nfinancial discipline, concentrating on the core business, and controlling the relationships \nbetween the government and the SOEs. \n\nThe  SOE  ownership  policy  becomes  a  reference  for  the  government  in  setting  the \nobjectives that SOEs must achieve as well as the regulations that they must implement. \nThe  ownership  policy  also  regulates  the  interaction  between  the  SOEs  and  their \nrespective  stakeholders  to  communicate  their  objectives  clearly  (OECD  2010).  The \ncombination  of  goals  that  SOEs  must  achieve  becomes  a  government  mandate  for \nSOEs.  Government  mandates  consist  of  general  and  specific  targets.  SOEs  should \nachieve the mandate in a span of time that could be short, medium, or as long as the \nSOEs exist. \n\nAs  the  OECD  (2014)  pointed  out,  the  government  may  interfere  in  SOEs\u2019  capital \nstructure,  as  their  crucial  part,  by  providing  government  support.  The  types  of \ngovernment assistance for SOEs include funds to purchase new shares that will increase \nthe government\u2019s shares, funds for SOEs that will not affect the government stocks due \nto public service obligations, or a combination of policies affecting SOEs\u2019 liabilities and \nequity increases. \n\nThe  Government  of  Indonesia  intervenes  in  SOEs\u2019  capital  by  providing  funds  or \ninfrastructures to support their businesses. The Government of Indonesia has provided \nsupport for SOEs by injecting funds into their capital, transferring assets to them, and \nproviding  financial  assistance.  The  government\u2019s  direct  capital  injection  is  financial \nbacking for SOEs\u2019 capital, which increases the government\u2019s shares. The government \nalso transfers its infrastructure to SOEs for them to manage as assets. Besides capital \ninjection  and  the  transfer  policy,  the  government  provides  to  SOEs  with  financial \nassistance for their business activities. \n\nThe OECD (2014) argued that the government should provide support funds for SOEs \nwhen  they  complete  government  targets  in  both  commercial  and  non-commercial \nactivities. In other words, the government provides funds as payments for public service \nobligations that SOEs have completed without taking profit margins as well as managing \nthe balance between debt and SOEs\u2019 equity to improve their performance. \n\nThe OECD (2014) also concluded that the government is allowed to provide support for \nSOEs.  The  scheme  of  government  financial  support  is  parallel  to  the  increase  in  the \ngovernment\u2019s  shares  and  payments  to  cover  the  costs  that  SOEs  incur  in  the \nimplementation of public service obligations. Furthermore, the government policy is to \nreduce the interest rate for SOE businesses, both commercial and non-commercial. \n\n \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 983 \n \n\nNugroho \n\nOther challenges that SOEs face, as the OECD (2014) stated, in addition to carrying out \nthe  government\u2019s  mandate,  are  controlling  markets  at  competitive  prices  and  tight \nfunding costs. To solve these problems, the government, as the major shareholder, may \nassist  SOEs  in  facing  their  financial  constraints  by  implementing  financial  assistance \nprograms. The OECD (2014) also emphasized that the government policy to improve the \ncapital structure has a significant impact on SOEs\u2019 performance, because it affects their \nability  to  carry  out  their  business  activities  while  maintaining  the  target  of  the \nstakeholders. \n\nThe  government  expects  the  presence  of  SOEs  in  both  profitable  and  unprofitable \nbusiness activities. For profit-generating activities, SOEs use their revenues to cover the \noperating costs incurred. However, the operating costs for unprofitable activities are a \nburden on SOEs\u2019 finance. Hence, they need financial support from the government. \n\nSOEs\u2019  unprofitable  activities  generally  relate  to  public  service  obligations.  These \nactivities have a negative impact on SOEs\u2019 performance because they must provide the \npublic with services or products but the government does not allow them to make profits. \nTherefore, SOEs should plan appropriately, run properly, and report all activities to the \ngovernment when they perform public service activities. \n\nAs  mentioned  by  the  OECD  (2010),  when  SOEs  carry  out  government  mandates  to \ndeliver public services, they should focus on the aspects of uncertainty that they may \nencounter, analyze and calculate the costs accurately, and report all information about \nbudget  implications  and  distribution  consequences.  Therefore,  SOEs  need  to  identify \npublic services and other specific obligations clearly, as these have a significant impact \non their performance. \n\nAfter  SOEs  have  completed  the  targeted  activities  as  directed  in  the  government \nmandates,  the  government  evaluates  the  results  based  on  the  reports  that  the  SOEs \nhave  submitted.  The  OECD  (2010)  emphasized  that,  to  review  SOEs\u2019  performance \neffectively, \nthat \ndemonstrates  their  performance.  The  government  requires  a  reporting  system  to \nevaluate SOEs\u2019 performance. Therefore, SOEs needs to initiate a reporting system that \ndiscloses all the information related to their activities. \n\nthe  government  must  have  appropriate  and  proper  material \n\nThe government might evaluate the performance of SOEs based on their report showing \nthe  performance  of  their  activities,  both  financial  and  non-financial.  The  government \ncompares SOEs\u2019 performance with the targets and objectives that it set at the beginning. \nAs  a  result,  the  government  may  decide  the  necessary  policy  related  to  the  next \ngovernment target. \n\n2.2  A Review of the Empirical Results on the Impact  \n\nof Government Support \n\nThere  are  numerous  ways  for  the  government  to  support  SOEs  in  improving  their \nperformance. Previous research has examined several types of government support for \ncompanies: subsidies, grants, incentives, research and development (R&D) funds, and \nventure capital. In this section, I review the ways in which government support affects \nthe output differently depending on the various factors.  \n\nMost research has aimed to observe the different effects of government support. Lee, \nWalker,  and  Zeng  (2014)  argued  that  government  subsidies  have  a  significant  effect  \non  the  Chinese  stock  market.  They  examined  the  value  relevance  of  government \nsubsidies on the Chinese stock market and found that subsidies were the most significant \nfor high-performing firms rather than low-performing firms. They argued that government \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 983 \n \n\nNugroho \n\nsubsidies  for  high-performing  companies  influence  investors\u2019  decisions  because  they \ndetermine  their  profits.  They  also  demonstrated  that  transparent  and  well-known \nsubsidies have more significant value. \n\nGuo, Guo, and Jiang (2016) reported the same significant impact of government funding. \nBy examining Innovation Fund data for small and medium technology companies, they \nstudied the effects of the Innovation Fund for Small and Medium Technology Enterprises, \nwhich is one of the largest government R&D programs supporting the R&D activities of \nsmall \nin  \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  They  found  that  small  and  medium-sized \ntechnology-based companies with government funding support achieved a higher output \nthan  companies  without  government  support.  In  addition,  government  programs  are \nmore effective and stronger if government support policies change from centralized to \ndecentralized. \n\nmedium-sized \n\nbusinesses \n\nenterprises \n\nand \n\nBesides  research  on  the  effect  of  government  support  for  R&D,  some  research  has \ninvestigated the effect of state control on firms\u2019 access to capital. Li, Su, and Yang (2012) \nexamined  the  effect  of  state  control  on  capital  allocation  and  investment  in  \nthe PRC. They conducted an experiment by applying the effect of state control on firms\u2019 \naccess to capital in the PRC, where the government controls the equity capital allocation \nprocess.  They  also  examined  the  consequences  of  this  governmental  control.  They \nargued  that  the  government  is  more  likely  to  grant  approval  to  increase  the  capital \nstructure to SOEs than to non-SOEs. As a result, it has a negative effect on non-SOEs, \nbecause  the  financial  restrictions  and  postponed  investment  plan  affect  the  firm \nperformance.  \n\nAnother  study,  by  Hsu  and  Hsueh  (2009),  offered  an  approach  to  measuring  \nthe  efficiency  of  a  government-sponsored  project  in  Taipei,China.  They  found  that  \nthe  efficiency  of  government-sponsored  research  and  development  projects  in \nTaipei,China  determined  not  only  the  government  subsidy  but  also  the  firm  size  \nand industry. \n\nDespite the fact that some research has shown a positive effect of government support, \nBoeing (2016) found a different result. He investigated the allocation of the PRC\u2019s R&D \nsubsidies  and  their  effectiveness  in  stimulating  business  R&D  investments  for  the \npopulation  of  Chinese  listed  firms  between  2001  and  2006.  He  emphasized  that \ngovernment subsidies decrease the private R&D in the short term but that the impact \nreturns to neutral in the long term.  \n\nAlperovych,  Hubner,  and  Lobet  (2015)  also  found  a  negative  effect  of  government \nassistance.  They  examined  the  implications  of  the  venture  capital  (VC)  investor  \ntype,  either  government  or  private,  on  the  operating  efficiency.  Using  a  sample  of  \n515 Belgian portfolio firms up to 3 years after the investment, they found that a firm with \nVC backing has low-level productivity and that a government-backed firm has a low level \nof efficiency. \n\nthe  nation\u2019s \n\nGuan and Yam (2015) also discovered a negative impact of government incentives. They \ninvestigated the effect of Chinese government financial incentives on firms\u2019 innovation \nperformance  during \nthe  \nmid-1990s.  They  argued  that  financial  incentives  have  a  negative  effect  on  firms\u2019 \ninnovative economic performance. They also showed that all the financial incentives of \nthe government are unrelated to the patents of either high-tech or general firms. They \nconcluded that the government funding policy with the central system has no significant \nimpact  on  the  technological  progress  of  Chinese  manufacturing  firms  and  that  it  \nwould  be  better  for  the  government  to  reform  the  market  by  encouraging  the  role  of  \nthe market. \n\ntransition  period \n\ninitial  economic \n\nin \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 983 \n \n\nNugroho \n\n2.3  A Review of the Empirical Results on Firm Performance \n\nThere is an abundance of studies that have investigated the relationship between state \nownership  and  firm  performance.  This  relationship  has  influenced  many  empirical \nstudies.  It  is  possible  to  measure  the  achievement  of  a  firm\u2019s  financial  performance \nthrough profitability ratios. Several ratios capture a firm\u2019s financial performance. Brealey \n(2011) explained that the ROE measures earnings for shareholders; in contrast, the ROA \nmeasures income for holders of liabilities and equity compared with total assets. Pratt \n(2011) argued that the ROA is broader than the ROE because the ROA compares the \nreturns to shareholders and creditors with the total assets and the total resources that \nshareholders and creditors provide. \n\nMost previous research has been conducted to observe the impact of state ownership \non firms\u2019 performance but not the impact of government support on the performance of \nSOEs. Nevertheless, the empirical findings regarding the impact of state ownership on \nfirm performance have varied. The different empirical findings may be due to the different \nmethodology  that  the  studies  used  to  measure  firm  performance  and  sample \nobservation.  Prior  studies  on  the  same  observation  have  used  several  methods  to \nmeasure firm performance. Each study obtained different empirical results because of \nthe different methodology. \n\nNumerous  studies  have  measured  firm  performance  using  profitability  ratios.  For \nexample, Sun, Tong, and Tong (2002) observed the relationship between government \nownership and all listed companies\u2019 performance during the 1994\u20131997 period based on \nthe PRC\u2019s privatization experience. This study demonstrates that government ownership \nhas a positive relationship with firm performance based on performance measured using \nthe market-to-book ratio (MBR) as a proxy for Tobin\u2019s Q. Other variables used in this \nmodel include state ownership, legal entity ownership, the natural logarithm of operating \nsales, debt-to-total assets, company locations, and regulated industries. \n\nLin, Ma, and Su (2009) also conducted research by applying a single ratio measuring \nfirm performance to the PRC\u2019s publicly listed firms between 1999 and 2002 to investigate \nwhether  corporate  governance  practices  affect  production  efficiency.  They  provided \nevidence that firm efficiency is negatively related to state ownership but positively related \nto  public  and  employee  share  ownership.  The  authors  showed  that  government \nownership has a U-shaped relationship with firm efficiency. \n\nAccording to Hess, Gunasekarage, and Hovey (2008), state ownership has a significant \ninfluence  on  firms\u2019  performance  if  the  government  holds  more  than  35%  of  the  total \nshares. In contrast, state ownership has no significant effect if the government\u2019s share \npercentage is small. They captured firm performance based on a single ratio, Tobin\u2019s Q. \nThis  research  made  the  same  observation  as  Lin,  Ma,  and  Su  (2009);  however,  the \nauthors used a different methodology. The other variables in this research included firm \nownership and specific parameters such as the debt\u2013equity ratio, the natural logarithm \nof total assets as a proxy for firm size, the annualized standard deviation of the share \nreturn for the 24 months preceding the end of the year, and industry dummies.  \n\nFurthermore, Gunasekarage, Hess, and Hu (2007) showed that state ownership has a \nnegative relationship with firms\u2019 performance. They combined Tobin\u2019s Q and the MBR to \nmeasure firm performance and made the same argument as Lin, Ma, and Su (2009) that \nstate ownership has a negative effect on corporate performance with a low percentage \nof  government  ownership  but  a  positive  effect  with  a  high  percentage  of  government \nownership. This study examined 1034 companies registered in the PRC for the period \n2000 to 2004 and employed variables such as the fraction of shares owned by the state, \nwhich it measured as the number of shares held by the state divided by the total number \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 983 \n \n\nNugroho \n\nof shares outstanding, the fraction of shares owned by legal persons, which it measured \nas the number of shares held by legal persons divided by the total number of shares \noutstanding, the fraction of shares owned by individual investors, which it measured as \nthe  number  of  shares  held  by  legal  persons  divided  by  the  total  number  of  shares \noutstanding, the debt-equity ratio, the firm size as the natural logarithm of the total assets, \nand  the  annualized  standard  deviation  of  the  monthly  share  return  for  the  36  months \npreceding the end of the year. \n\nWei and Varela (2003) obtained the same empirical results regarding firms\u2019 performance. \nThey investigated relationships with state ownership on the same observations as the \nnewly  privatized  PRC  during  the  period  1994\u20131996  using  a  combination  of  Tobin\u2019s  Q \nand  the  monthly  stock  return  (MSR)  as  a  monthly  average  of  arithmetic  stocks  to \nmeasure the company performance. This study provided evidence that state ownership \nhas a negative relationship with firms\u2019 performance using Tobin\u2019s Q ratio as a measure \nbut a positive relationship when using the MSR as a measure.  \n\nYu (2013) and Mao (2015) used a combination of Tobin\u2019s Q ratio and others. Both of \nthese studies combined Tobin\u2019s Q, the ROA, and the ROE to measure the performance \nof  listed  companies  in  the  PRC.  Yu  (2013)  established  a  model  based  on  the  ROA,  \nthe  ROE,  Tobin\u2019s  Q,  state  ownership,  directors\u2019  compensation,  board  ownership,  the \nlogarithm of the board salary, the logarithm of assets as the firm size, and the debt ratio. \nThe author believed that state ownership has a U-shaped relationship with companies\u2019 \nperformance. This study also demonstrated that a high percentage of government stock \nownership has a positive influence on the capital structure due to state support.  \n\nUsing a model that was broadly identical to Yu\u2019s (2013) model, Mao (2015) reached the \nsame  conclusion  that  state  ownership  has  a  negative  effect  on  firm  performance, \nbecause state owners are concerned only with non-financial objectives, such as political \ntargets, rather than financial targets. These findings were based on Chinese public listed \nfirms\u2019  performance,  which  the  author  measured  using  the  ROA,  the  ROE,  Tobin\u2019s  Q, \nstate  ownership  as  the  percentage  of  shares  owned  by  the  government,  institutional \nownership as the percentage of shares owned by institutions, leverage computed as the \ntotal debt to total assets, the size of the firm as the logarithm of the total assets, and the \ntotal value of tangible assets. \n\nThe  ROA,  the  ROS,  and  Tobin\u2019s  Q  are  closely  related  to  firm  performance.  Le  and \nChizema (2011) completed the previous studies by adding the ROS instead of Tobin\u2019s \nQ  and  the  ROA  to  show  that  the  effect  of  state  ownership  on  firms\u2019  value  and \nperformance  is  moderate.  In  addition,  state  ownership  has  a  significant  effect  on  firm \nperformance, but the effect is moderate when measuring the firm value and performance \ntogether. However, this study shows that low-level government ownership has a negative \neffect on corporate value. Furthermore, high-level government ownership has a positive \neffect on the value of the company if the percentage of government stocks is at a high \nlevel.  This  study  was  based  on  the  performance  of  listed  companies  in  the  PRC \naccording to Tobin\u2019s Q, the ROA, and the ROS. The other variables in this model were \nstate ownership, the firm size as measured using the employee logarithm, the debt to \nequity  ratio,  and  the  industry  type.  Moreover,  this  study  showed  that  government \nintervention may improve companies\u2019 performance in the short term but that long-term \ngovernment intervention has no impact on avoiding the impairment of corporate value. \n\n Jiang, Laurenceson, and Tang (2008) believed that the government share percentage \nhas a positive impact on firm performance. This research employed variables such as \nthe sum of the state share proportion and the legal person share proportion, the ratio of \nstate shares, the sum of state and legal person shares, the size of the firm measured \nusing the logarithm of total assets, and the industry as vector dummy variables and the \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 983 \n \n\nNugroho \n\nlocation as a dummy variable. The authors empirically examined firm performance based \non the ROA, ROE, ROS, and REITA as the ratio of earnings before interest minus taxes \nto assets (REITA) applied to 794 samples out of the total 821 listed companies on the \nShanghai Stock Exchange as of the 2004 year end.  \n\nChen,  Firth,  and  Xu  (2009)  developed  a  complete  model  to  investigate  the  efficiency  \nof  state  ownership  compared  with  private  ownership  of  listed  companies  and  the \nefficiency of state ownership forms only on the PRC\u2019s listed companies. Instead of the \nROA, the ROS, and Tobin\u2019s Q, they examined the cash flow return on assets (CFOA), \nwhich they determined using the operating cash flows against the average book value of \ntotal  assets.  They  argued  that  the  efficiency  level  of  firms  varies  among  shareholder \ntypes.  They  also  employed  companies\u2019  productivity  by  sales  per  employee  (SEMP), \nwhich  they  described  as  the  net  sales  divided  by  the  number  of  employees,  and  the \nassets per employee (AEMP), which they determined as the average book value of total \nassets divided by the number of employees. \n\n3.  DATA AND METHODOLOGY \n\nThe  main  objective  of  this  study  is  to  answer  my  research  question  by  developing  a \nregression  model  to  estimate  the  relationship  between  government  support  and  firm \nperformance.  The  empirical  findings  of  the  previous  studies  have  shown  a  varied \nrelationship between government support and firm performance. Therefore, in this study, \nI  try  to  measure  the  impact  of  financial  government  support  on  SOEs\u2019  financial \nperformance. \n\nIn  this  paper,  I  employ  ordinary  least  square  (OLS)  multiple  regression  analysis  to \ninvestigate  and  present  evidence  of  SOEs\u2019  performance  as  an  empirical  model  of \ngovernment support\u2019s impact. I use the firm-level panel data for six financial periods from \n2010  through  2015.  This  analysis  employs  a  firm  fixed-effect  model  to  capture  time-\ninvariant unobservable factors and control the omitted-variable bias (OVB) because of \nunobservable \nthe  equation.  \nI  also  apply  year  fixed  effects  to  capture  unobservable  factors  that  commonly  occur  \nfor  all  firms.  Moreover,  I  adopt  a  clustered  standard  error  (heteroskedasticity-  and \nautocorrelation-consistent  standard  error/HAC-clustered  SE)  to  solve  the  serial \ncorrelation  problem  that  arises  in  panel  data  and  to  ensure  the  robustness  of  \nthe model. \n\nthat  may  correlate  with  variables \n\nfactors \n\nin \n\n3.1  Data \n\nThis paper aims to investigate the effect of government support on SOEs\u2019 performance \nby utilizing a panel data set of all Indonesia\u2019s SOEs from 2010 through 2015. The number \nof SOEs has fluctuated each year, because some SOEs have closed due to bankruptcy \nand the government has newly formed other SOEs. The detailed numbers of Indonesia\u2019s \nSOEs  are  145  SOEs \nin  2013,  \n125 SOEs in 2014, and 122 SOEs in 2015. Indonesia\u2019s SOEs operate in 31 industries \n(Ministry of Finance of Republic Indonesia 2016). \n\nin  2010,  2011,  and  2012,  144  SOEs \n\nI consider a business entity as an Indonesian SOE if the government holds at least 51% \nof the shares or the government is the major shareholder. As SOEs have an influential \npart in developing Indonesia\u2019s economy, the government as a major shareholder has the \npolicy to strengthen the SOEs by providing support. In 2015, the government injected \nfunds that reached Rp64.88 trillion into the capital of 43 SOEs (Ministry of Finance of \nRepublic Indonesia 2016). This direct capital injection policy shows an upward trend over \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 983 \n \n\nNugroho \n\nfive years. The expected result from this policy is real acts from all Indonesia\u2019s SOEs to \ndevelop both infrastructure and non-infrastructure sectors. \n\nThe  empirical  model  in  this  study  combines  SOEs\u2019  financial  statements,  government \ninvestment annual reports, and other significant data. I obtain SOEs\u2019 financial statements \nfrom each SOE and from Indonesia\u2019s Ministry of SOEs.  \n\nThe main variable of interest in this study is government support for SOEs. Government \nsupport refers to financial backing that the government gives to SOEs to enable them to \nachieve the government\u2019s goals. The types of government support in this study consist \nof the value of direct capital injection into SOEs, the transfer of government infrastructure \nto  SOEs,  and  government  assistance.  Government  capital  injection  refers  to  funds \nprovided for SOEs to support their business activities, while the transfer of government \ninfrastructure is infrastructure that the government has built and then hands over to SOEs \nfor them to manage as their assets. Both government capital injection and government \ninfrastructure \nin  SOEs.  However, \ngovernment assistance would not increase the government\u2019s capital, because it relates \nto funds or infrastructure that the government provides for SOEs to use to assist in their \noperations but excludes firm assets and will not increase the government\u2019s shares. \n\nthe  government\u2019s  capital \n\ntransfers \n\nincrease \n\nThe variables and the explanation of the methodology that I use to analyze the impact of \ngovernment support on the performance of SOEs in this study are the following. \n\n3.2  Dependent Variables \n\nThe variable perf is the performance of SOE i at time t. To measure SOEs\u2019 performance, \nI use the ROA, ROE, and ROS. I formulate the ROA as the net comprehensive income \ndivided  by  the  total  assets.  I  use  the  ROA  to  show  not  only  SOEs\u2019  profitability \nperformance but also the efficiency of assets in generating profit. I measure the ROE as \nthe  net  comprehensive  income  divided  by  the  total  equity.  I  utilize  the  ROE  to \ndemonstrate the profitability and return to the government capital. I obtain the ROS from \nthe earnings before interest and tax divided by the total sales. I use the ROS to measure \nprofitability and productivity, which the sales level captures. \n\nThis  study  employs  the  ROA  and  ROE  to  analyze  a  panel  data  set  of  all  Indonesia\u2019s \nSOEs. As public enterprises, Indonesia\u2019s SOEs not only are involved in non-commercial \nactivity or public service obligations to meet people\u2019s demand but also pursue profits. \nHence, the study uses the ROA to measure the effectiveness of government support for \nSOE performance, which it measures as the rate of return on the total assets, while it \nuses the ROE to measure the rate of return on the government\u2019s equity as a shareholder. \nThus,  it  applies  the  ROE  to  measure  SOEs\u2019  performance  as  public  enterprises  to \nmeasure their performance using the rate of return on government capital. \n\n3.3  Independent Variables \n\nThe  variable  log_govsupp  is  the  natural  logarithm  of  government  support.  I  measure \ngovernment  support  as  the  sum  of  direct  capital  injected  into  SOEs,  the  transfer  of \ngovernment  infrastructure  to  SOEs,  and  government  assistance.  To  provide  the  real \nvalue of government support, I divide government support by the consumer price index \nfor each year. \n\nThe variable npfm is the net profit margin, which I calculate from the net comprehensive \nincome  divided  by \nto  demonstrate  \nthe profitability of SOEs. \n\nthis  variable \n\ntotal  sales. \n\nI  use \n\nthe \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 983 \n \n\nNugroho \n\nThe variable tato is the total asset turnover, which I measure as the total sales divided \nby the total assets. I use it to gauge the productivity and efficiency of SOEs\u2019 assets. \n\nThe variable wcto is the working capital turnover, which I obtain by dividing the total sales \nby the total equity. I use this variable to show the efficiency and productivity of SOEs\u2019 \nequity.  \n\nThe variable das is the debt\u2013asset ratio, which I formulate as the total liability divided by \nthe total assets. Therefore, this variable represents SOEs\u2019 leverage ratio. \n\nThe variable der is the debt\u2013equity ratio, which I calculate as the total liability divided by \nthe total equity. Like the variable das, this variable shows SOEs\u2019 leverage level. \n\nThe variable gvt_perc is the percentage of state ownership, which shows the percentage \nof common shares held by the government. It is possible to categorize firms as SOEs if \nthe government holds more than 51% of the total shares.  \n\nThe variable size shows the firm size, which I measure as the natural logarithm of the \ntotal assets.

In the first model, the regression \nshows the simplest regression model without firm fixed effects and clustered standard \nerrors.  In  the  second  model,  the  regression  contains  firm  fixed  effects  and  clustered \nstandard errors. \n\nThe result of the regression in Table 2 model 1 indicates that government support has a \npositive and significant correlation with firm performance as measured using the ROA. It \nreveals that government support has a positive and significant correlation with the net \ncomprehensive income and total assets. These findings mean that higher government \nsupport will improve the performance of SOEs. Hence, government support is likely to \nimprove  SOEs\u2019  performance.  In  other  words,  government  support  shows  a  positive \nrelationship with the ROA, which shows the rate of return on investment to shareholders \nand creditors. \n\nThe  variable  npfm,  the  net  profit  margin,  has  a  positive  and  significant  correlation. \nIntuitively, the higher profit raises SOEs\u2019 performance. Nevertheless, the variable wcto, \nwhich  shows  that  the  productivity  level  of  equity  drives  the  sales,  and  the  variable \ngvt_perc,  which  indicates  the  government  share  percentage,  have  a  negative \nrelationship with the ROA. This result implies that an increase in the sales level compared \nwith the equity has a negative correlation with the ROA, because the ROA only measures \nthe  net  return  on  assets.  An  increase  in  government  shares  also  has  a  negative \ncorrelation with the ROA. These findings, to some extent, are consistent with those of \nHess and Hu (2007) and Wei and Varela (2003), who provided evidence of the negative \ncorrelation  between  state  ownership  and  firm  performance.  The  results  of  the \nregressions in model 1, although apparently robust, do not include firm fixed effects and \nclustered standard errors. Hence, this set of regression results may suffer from biases. \nTo overcome this problem, I add the firm fixed effects and clustered standard errors to \nregression model 2. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 983 \n \n\nNugroho \n\nTable 2: Regression Coefficients for the Impact of Government Support  \non the Return on Assets \n\nVariables \nDependent variable \nEstimation method \nlog_govsupp \n\nNpfm \n\nTato \n\nWcto \n\nDas \n\nDer \n\ngvt_perc \n\nSize \n\nConstant \n\nFirm fixed effect \nYear fixed effect \nHAC (clustered) SEs (within firm) \nn \nR2 \n\n*** p < 0.01, ** p < 0.05, * p < 0.1. \n\nNote: Robust standard errors in parentheses. \n\nRegression Analyses \n(2) \n(1) \nROA \nROA \nFE \nOLS \n.00489 \n.00404** \n(.00367) \n(.00174) \n.00513*** \n.00694*** \n(.00130) \n(.00149) \n.26409*** \n.25688*** \n(.03317) \n(.03816) \n\u2013.00189** \n\u2013.00308 \n(.00079) \n(.00206) \n\u2013.04904*** \n\u2013.04375*** \n(.00908) \n(.01055) \n.00309*** \n.00339*** \n(.00054) \n(.00095) \n.00028 \n\u2013.00137 \n(.00345) \n(.00088) \n\u2013.09407 \n.01262*** \n(.09549) \n(.00357) \n.71495 \n\u2013.11381 \n(1.1369) \n(.10548) \nYes \nNo \nYes \nYes \nYes \nNo \n813 \n813 \n0.8710 \n0.7749 \n\nTo control the unobservable firm-specific characteristics that vary across firms but do not \nchange over time within each firm, I add firm fixed effects to regression model 2. After \nadding the firm fixed effects, the significance of the variable government support in model \n1 disappears. In other words, the regression results in model 1 omit unobservable firm-\nspecific characteristics, which causes biases in the regression results. Regression model \n2 provides evidence that government support does not have a significant effect on SOEs\u2019 \nperformance after adding firm fixed effects and clustered standard errors. \n\nTo treat the potential correlation of the error term over time within a firm, I also employ \nheteroskedasticity- and autocorrelation-consistent (HAC) standard errors or clustering in \nregression model 2. Using HAC standard errors, the clustered standard errors in model \n2 are larger than those in model 1 and provide evidence that the errors are correlated \nover time. \n\n \n\n \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 983 \n \n\nNugroho \n\nIn  regression  2,  government  support  has  a  positive  but  not  significant  effect  on  \nthe  SOEs\u2019  performance.  Providing  more  rigorous  results  and  minimizing  the  omitted \nvariable bias, the regression in model 2 reveals that government support does not have \na  significant  effect  on  SOEs\u2019  performance,  which  I  measure  using  the  ROA,  after \nemploying firm fixed effects and clustered standard errors.  \n\nThese  findings  show  that  government  support  does  not  provide  a  profit  return  for  the \ngovernment as the main shareholder. This suggests that the government might provide \nsupport  for  public  service  obligations  or  non-commercial  activities.  However,  SOEs \nachieve  the  governments\u2019  mandate  to  engage  in  non-commercial  activities  or  public \nservice obligations in which SOEs must not take profit from the activities. \n\nThe coefficient of variables npfm, tato, and der have a positive and significant correlation \nwith the ROA at the 1% level, which means that the higher profit that the variable npfm \ncaptures raises SOEs\u2019 performance as measured using the ROA. The higher productivity \nand  efficiency  of  SOEs\u2019  assets,  as  showed  by  the  variable  tato,  affect  SOEs\u2019 \nperformance. SOEs\u2019 leverage, as the variable der indicates, has a positive and significant \ncorrelation  with  the  ROA,  which  means  that  an  increase  in  SOEs\u2019  leverage  improves \nSOEs\u2019 performance. \n\nHowever,  the  other  SOEs\u2019  leverage  ratio,  which  the  variable  das  represents,  has  a \nnegative and significant relationship with the ROA. It suggests that an increase in the \nassets financed by debt decreases the firm performance significantly. The variable wcto \nalso  has  a  negative  and  significant  correlation  with  the  ROA,  which  means  that  an \nincrease in the sales level compared with the equity will decrease SOEs\u2019 performance, \ndue to the ROA not measuring sales performance. \n\n4.3  The Impact of Government Support on SOEs\u2019 Performance \n\nMeasured Using the Return on Equity Ratio \n\nTable 3 provides the regression result of SOEs\u2019 performance measured using the ROE. \nThe first model is the simplest regression model without firm fixed effects and clustered \nstandard errors. The second model is the regression model with firm fixed effects and \nclustered standard errors. \n\nTable  3  shows  the  government  support  variable  regressed  against  the  ROE  variable. \nThe  result  in  model  1  shows  that  government  support  has  a  positive  and  significant \ncorrelation  with  firm  performance  as  measured  using  the  ROE.  It  demonstrates  that \ngovernment support has a positive and significant correlation with net comprehensive \nincome and total equity.  \n\nIn regression 1, the variables npfm and der have a positive and significant correlation \nwith the ROA. Furthermore, I find that the variables wcto, gvt_perc, das, and tato have a \nnegative  relationship  with  the  ROE.  SOEs\u2019  size  as  a  proxy  for  the  logarithm  of  \ntotal  assets also  has  a negative  and  significant  relationship  with  the  ROE.  This  result \nmeans that bigger SOEs tend to have a negative relationship with SOEs\u2019 performance \nbased on the return to shareholders. However, regression model 1 does not employ firm \nfixed effects and clustered standard errors, so the result may suffer from omitted variable \nbias. \n\nRegression model 2 employs firm fixed effects and clustered standard errors. The result \nshows that government support has a negative relationship with the ROE. This result \nprovides  evidence  that  government  support  does  not  have  any  statistically  significant \neffect  on  SOEs\u2019  performance.  This  finding  is  consistent  with  the  empirical  result  that \nGuan  and  Yam  (2015)  obtained.

The  debt\u2013equity  ratio, \nwhich variable der represents, has a positive correlation with the ROE that is significant \nat the 1% level, which means that an increase in SOEs\u2019 equity\u2013debt finance raises the \nSOEs\u2019 performance based on the ROE. \n\nTable 3: Regression Coefficients for the Impact of Government Support  \non the Return on Equity \n\nRegression Analyses \n\nVariables \nDependent variable \nEstimation method \nlog_govsupp \n\nNpfm \n\nTato \n\nWcto \n\nDas \n\nDer \n\ngvt_perc \n\nSize \n\nConstant \n\nFirm fixed effect \nYear fixed effect \nHAC (clustered) SEs (within the firm) \nn \nR2 \n\n*** p < 0.01, ** p < 0.05, * p < 0.1. \n\nNote: Robust standard errors in parentheses. \n\n(1) \nROE \nOLS \n.36749** \n(.14387) \n.14179* \n(.07788) \n\u2013.03072 \n(.17676) \n\u2013.99215** \n(.41527) \n\u2013.06667 \n(.04311) \n1.6139*** \n(.42479) \n\u2013.11826** \n(.06016) \n\u20131.3479*** \n(.37583) \n21.816** \n(8.2610) \nNo \nYes \nNo \n813 \n0.7710 \n\n(2) \nROE \nFE \n\u2013.15735 \n(.28972) \n.09403 \n(.08060) \n\u2013.26791 \n(.26525) \n\u20131.0498** \n(.42604) \n\u2013.06748 \n(.05654) \n1.7294*** \n(.38690) \n\u2013.10317 \n(.08937) \n\u20133.4435 \n(3.3020) \n40.745 \n(36.665) \nYes \nYes \nYes \n813 \n0.8595 \n\n4.4  The Impact of Government Support on SOEs\u2019 Performance \n\nMeasured Using the Return on Sales Ratio \n\nTable 4 provides the regression result of SOEs\u2019 performance measured using the ROS. \nIn  the  first  model,  the  regression  is  the  simplest  regression  model  without  firm  fixed \neffects and clustered standard errors.

In  this  regression,  government  support  is  regressed  against  the \nROS. Using a simple OLS in model 1, government support has a negative correlation \nwith firm productivity, which the ROS captures. It reveals that government support has a \nnegative correlation with sales and earnings before interest and tax. The variables tato, \nwcto,  der,  and  gvt_perc  have  a  similar  correlation  with  the  variable  log_govsupp. \nMoreover, the variable size has a negative and significant correlation with the ROS at \nthe 10% significance level.  \n\nThe variables that show a positive relationship with the ROS in model 1 are npfm and \ndas. The variable npfm has a positive and significant relationship with the ROS, revealing \nthat  the  net  profit  margin  has  a  positive  and  significant  correlation  with  the  SOE \nperformance  indicator  measured  using  the  ROS.  The  variable  das  has  a  positive  but \ninsignificant correlation with the ROS, which means that an increase in SOEs\u2019 leverage \neffects  a  better  SOE  performance.  However,  this  model  does  not  employ  firm  fixed \neffects and clustered standard errors; consequently, the findings may suffer from omitted \nvariable bias. \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 983 \n \n\nNugroho \n\nAfter  employing  the  firm  fixed  effects  and  clustered  standard  errors,  the  result  of \nregression model 2 indicates that government support has a negative and insignificant \ncorrelation with the ROS. However, the variable npfm shows a positive and significant \ncorrelation with the ROS, because it boosts the return to sales performance. This result, \nwhich is consistent with the result in model 1, suggests that the net profit margin raises \nSOEs\u2019 performance measured using the ROS. The coefficients of the variables tato, der, \nand gvt_perc have a positive but insignificant correlation with the ROS. In contrast, the \nvariables wcto, das, and size have a negative and insignificant correlation with the ROS. \n\n5.  ROBUSTNESS CHECKS \n\n5.1  Autocorrelation-Consistent Standard Errors \n\nI check the robustness of each regression model by scrutinizing the coefficient result and \nthe significance level of the empirical result between the dependent and the independent \nvariables in the regression model that I demonstrated in the previous section. Moreover, \nI test the model by applying simple OLS regression and regression with firm and year \nfixed  effects  and  clustered  standard  errors  (heteroskedasticity-  and  autocorrelation-\nconsistent standard errors/HAC-clustered SE). \n\n5.2  Lagged Regression Models for the Government Support \n\nVariable \n\nTable 5 presents the results of the relationship between government support and SOEs\u2019 \nperformance  using  the  fixed-effect  model,  autocorrelation-consistent  standard  errors, \nand  the  lagged  effect  of  government  support.  Applying  the  lagged  effect  confirms  the \neffect of government support on SOEs\u2019 future performance after they have received the \nsupport. \n\nThe empirical findings in Table 5 are broadly consistent and indicate the robustness of \nthe empirical results of all the different specifications: government support does not have \na significant correlation with SOEs\u2019 financial performance. Hence, these findings do not \nprovide any argument to support the previous studies that found a significant relationship \nbetween  government  support  and  firms\u2019  performance.

CONCLUSION \n\nThis paper aimed to examine the impact of government support on the performance of \nIndonesia\u2019s  SOEs.  The  result  is  important  for  the  government,  because  it  shows \nempirically the impact of the government\u2019s funding on SOEs\u2019 financial performance. By \nexamining the government support, which combines direct capital injection into SOEs, \nthe transfer of the government\u2019s infrastructure to SOEs, and government assistance, this \npaper provides unique findings regarding the impact of government support on SOEs\u2019 \nperformance. \n\nThis  study  used  a  panel  data  set  of  all  Indonesia\u2019s  SOEs  from  2010  through  2015  \nand  employed  firm  fixed  effects  to  measure  unobservable  firm-specific  characteristics \nthat vary across firms but do not change over time within each firm. It also adopted year \nfixed effects to capture unobservable factors that are constant and occur commonly for \nall \nit  used  clustered  standard  errors \n(heteroskedasticity-  and  autocorrelation-consistent  standard  errors/HAC-clustered  SE) \nto  solve  the  serial  correlation  problem  that  arises  in  panel  data  and  to  ensure  the \nrobustness of the model.  \n\nfirms  but  vary  over \n\ntime.  Moreover, \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 983 \n \n\nNugroho \n\nWithout  firm  fixed  effects  and  clustered  standard  errors,  government  support  has  a \npositive and significant correlation with SOEs\u2019 performance, using the ROA and ROE as \nmeasures. However, by applying the firm fixed-effect model and HAC-clustered standard \nerrors,  the  study  shows  that  the  government  support  for  the  SOEs  did  not  have  a \nsignificant  effect  on  SOEs\u2019  financial  performance.  These  findings  are  somewhat \nconsistent  with  the  result  that  Guan  and  Yam  (2015)  obtained:  the  government  \nfunding  policy  has  no  significant  impact  on  the  technological  progress  of  Chinese \nmanufacturing  firms  and  it  is  better  for  the  government  to  reform  the  market  by \nencouraging the role of the market. \n\nGovernment support is more likely to increase SOEs\u2019 assets but does not create financial \nbenefits  for  them.  SOEs  might  involve  non-commercial  activity  or  public  service \nobligations  to  meet  people\u2019s  demand  and  execute  the  government\u2019s  mandate.  As  a \nresult, government support has no impact on SOEs\u2019 performance. \n\nIn  spite  of  the  non-significant  relationship  between  government  support  and  financial \nperformance,  this  result  still  has  policy  implications.  The  government  should  take  into \naccount its support for SOEs, implying that the government needs to consider alternative \nsolutions  to  design  a  proper  government  support  policy  and  generate  higher  financial \nperformance. \n\nTo design the government support policy, clear communication between the government \nand  the  SOEs  is  necessary,  especially  in  determining  the  policy  direction  of  the \ngovernment support. The government also needs to determine precisely whether it will \nencourage  SOEs  by  increasing  its  investment  in  them  in  the  future  with  the  \naim  of  boosting  their  performance  to  meet  the  government\u2019s  service  obligations.  In \nconclusion, effective communication between the government and the SOEs about the \ngovernment\u2019s objectives might support the effectiveness of the government support for \nSOEs\u2019 performance.  \n\nThe results of this paper are necessary for formulating the government support policy \ncompared  with  SOEs\u2019  financial  performance  measurement.  By  providing  an  empirical \nmodel for measuring the relationship between government support and SOEs\u2019 financial \nperformance, this study also contributes to the research on SOEs. \n\nFuture research can explore government support\u2019s effect on SOEs for a larger range of \nSOEs  and  a  longer  time  period  of  observations  and  apply  more  variables.  Moreover, \nfuture  study  can  investigate  the  impact  of  financial  government  support  on  SOEs\u2019 \nfinancial and non-financial performance. \n\n \n\n \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 983 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nNugroho \n\nAlperovych, Y., G.
