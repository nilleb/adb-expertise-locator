INTRODUCTION \n\nLiu, Hu, Dean, and Yao \n\nEnergy efficiency is a key national strategy for sustainable development in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC). In the 13th five-year plan (2016\u20132020), the country aims to \nreduce energy intensity per unit of GDP by 15% in 2020 compared to 2015. If the PRC\u2019s \nGDP  grows  by  6.5%  annually  over  2016\u20132020,  this  target  implies  increasing  energy \nsavings by 16% compared to 12th five-year plan, equivalent to absolute energy savings \nof 23 EJ (780 Mtce).  \n\nAs a primary measure of improving energy efficiency, the Chinese government plans to \npromote the utilization of low-grade excess heat in district heating systems, with a target \nof replacing more than 1.5 EJ (50 Mtce) of coal-based heat production associated with \nheating more than 2 billion m2 of buildings by 2020. This plan also aims to pilot clean \nheating projects in 150 cities. At the G20 Energy Ministerial meeting held in 2016, the \nnewly endorsed G20 Energy Efficiency Leading Programme (EELP) highlighted district \nenergy  systems  as  a  key  area  of  future  collaboration.  In  2017,  the  PRC\u2019s  National \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission  (NDRC)  published  the  Clean  Heating  Plan  of \nNorthern Region (2017\u20132020) as a guideline to promote clean heating in the PRC.  \n\nThe PRC has the largest district heating system in the world. The heating area increased \nfrom  5  billion  m2  to  14.7  billion  m2  between  2001  and  2018  due  to  improved  living \nstandards  and  population  growth.  The  annual  energy  consumption  for  space  heating \nreached  6.2  EJ  (212  Mtce)  in  2018,  representing  about  21%  of  the  total  energy \nconsumption in the PRC\u2019s building sector (Tsinghua University 2020). \n\nThe energy intensity of the heating services in the PRC, expressed as the ratio of heating \nenergy consumption and heated floor area, decreased by 37% from 0.67 GJ/m2 in 2001 \nto  0.42  GJ/m2  in  2018.  The  replacement  of  small  heat-only  boilers  by  centralized \ncombined heat and power (CHP) sources and widespread adoption of energy efficiency \nmeasures in the building sector explain some of the improvement in the space heating \nenergy intensity (International Energy Agency and Tsinghua University 2015).  \n\nHeating services in the PRC rely heavily on coal. More than 90% of the building floor \narea is heated by coal co-generation (combined heat and power) and/or coal boilers. The \ncapacity  of  natural  gas  boilers  has  increased  to  8%  of  the  total  heating  floor  area. \nHowever, the relatively high cost of natural gas compared to coal makes district heating \nless affordable without government subsidies. \n\nMore than ever, the challenges of controlling air pollution and capping coal consumption \nhave prompted the PRC to develop clean alternatives to its coal-dominant district heating \nsystem. For this, the government is engaging in a series of actions to recover excess \nheat to enhance the energy efficiency of district heating systems.  \n\nThe use of excess heat and pressure is a major country-wide energy-saving measure \n(State Council 2016). Financial support policies, in the form of investment subsidies and \npreferential tax treatments, were provided over the period of the 11thh and 12th five-year \nplans (2006\u20132015). Most commercially viable heat recovery projects have already been \nimplemented. Indeed, in the PRC, about 55% of excess heat potential\u2014mainly high and \nmedium grade excess heat\u2014has already been recycled for energy generation or on-site \nindustrial  processes  (International  Energy  Agency  and  Tsinghua  University  2015). \nHowever, low-grade industrial excess heat, usually defined as flue gas below 200\n or \nliquid below 100\n\n, is rarely recycled for energy use.  \n\nWhile  it  is  well  known  that  the  PRC  has  the  world\u2019s  largest  manufacturing  sector, \nproducing  a  huge  amount  of  low-grade  industrial  excess  heat,  the  literature  on  this \n\n\u2103\n\n\u2103\n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1203 \n \n\nLiu, Hu, Dean, and Yao \n\nremains  limited.  Fang  et  al.  (2013)  and  Fang,  Xia,  and  Jiang  (2015)  conclude  that \nrecovering  low-grade  industrial  excess  heat  for  low-temperature  district  heating  can \nprovide multiple benefits for factories, heat-supply, and the society in the PRC. Li et al. \n(2016) study technological options and provide a cost-benefit analysis for the collection \nand delivery of industrial excess heat in the northern PRC. Likewise, based on cases in \nDenmark,  the  Energy  Technology  Development  and  Demonstration  Program  (2014) \ninvestigates  the  efficiency  benefits  of  district  heating  networks  through  increased \nutilization  of  renewable  energy  and  low  temperature  resources.  Meanwhile,  various \nbarriers exist to prevent effective consideration of low-grade industrial excess heat for \ndistrict heating purposes. S\u00f6derholm and W\u00e5rell (2011) highlight third-party access as \nthe key barrier to introducing clean heat sources into district heating. The Energy Sector \nManagement Assistance Program (ESMAP 2008) suggests that the PRC may need to \nimplement market-based pricing and consumption-based billing to commoditize the heat \nsupply and thus incentivize efficiency improvement. Liu, Yao, and Wei (2019) quantify \nthe  gap  in  energy  efficiency  improvement  attributed  to  the  information  asymmetry \nbetween the government and industries in the PRC. This study aims to fill the knowledge \ngap  through  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  financing  models  and  pricing  schemes \napplicable to the utilization of low-grade industrial excess heat in district heating systems. \n\nThe remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. Section 2 describes opportunities \nand challenges of scaling up the integration of low-grade industrial excess heat into the \ndistrict heating system. Section 3 investigates three business models for financing district \nheating  energy  efficiency  projects.  Section  4  examines  four  options  related  to  excess \nheat  pricing.  Section  5  concludes  with  a  range  of  policy  options  to  enable  energy \nefficiency financing.  \n\n2.  OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE PRC\u2019S \n\nDISTRICT HEATING MARKET  \n\n2.1  The PRC\u2019s Low-grade Excess Heat Potential \n\nTsinghua University (2018) investigates the technical potential for recovering and using \nlow-grade  excess  heat  from  major  industries  in  the  northern  PRC.  The  analysis \nconcludes that there is a huge untapped potential of 3 EJ (100 Mtce) for the resources \nof industrial excess heat which can be used in district-heating networks. This amounts \nto  roughly  half  of  the  current  energy  demand  for  district  heating  in  the  northern  PRC \n(Tsinghua University 2018). In many cities, such as Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Handan, \nQinhuangdao,  and  Chengde,  the  quantity  of  excess  heat  can  meet  a  significant  part  \nof  heat  demand.  Tangshan  has  seen  the  amount  of  excess  heat  even  surpass  its  \nheat  demand.  It  is  noted  that  in  all  these  cities,  a  major  part  of  the  excess  heat  is \ncharacterized by a temperature lower than 50\u00b0C. \n\nSpecifically,  energy-intensive  industries  are  geographically  concentrated  in  a  few \nprovinces  such  as  Hebei,  Shandong,  Jiangsu,  Liaoning,  Shanxi,  Henan,  and \nHeilongjiang. Among these areas, Hebei is the largest industrial province surrounding \nBeijing and Tianjin (Li et al. 2016; National Development and Reform Commission 2017). \nBeijing, Tianjin, and Hebei are collectively known as Jingjinji, a name derived from the \nnames of all three areas. Jingjinji region is not only the political center of the PRC but \nalso  one  of  the  heavy  industry  bases.  Specifically,  Hebei  represents  25%  of  national \nsteel production and more than 5% of national cement production. Over the last decade, \nJingjinji has been suffering from heavy smog, especially in the winter season, which is in \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1203 \n \n\nLiu, Hu, Dean, and Yao \n\nlarge part attributed to fossil fuel consumption for the supply of district heating (Clean Air \nAsia 2015).  \n\nTsinghua University (2018) suggests that the PRC may consider connecting neighboring \ncities\u2019 district energy systems to solve the shortage in clean heat sources and severe air \npollution,  primarily  in  Jingjinji.  For  example,  large-diameter  water  tubes  and  networks \ncould be established to link Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, and other cities. In this way, the \nmain  district  heating  facilities,  including  CHP  plants,  heat-only  boilers,  and  industrial \nexcess  heat  resources,  could  be  integrated  into  an  overall  system.  Thanks  to  smart \nheating technologies, heat-rich cities may thus provide surplus heat to heat-poor cities. \nThis will help replace coal consumption and balance heat demand and supply across \nregional borders.  \n\n2.2  Characteristics of District Heating Systems  \n\nIndustrial  excess  heat  is  usually  heterogeneous,  dispersed,  and  intermittent.  These \ncharacteristics mean that to make industrial excess heat part of the baseload in a district \nheating system, the operator will need to maintain back-up heating capacities. Significant \nbalancing costs are required to adjust and integrate various temperature grades of heat \nsources  in  district  heating  systems.  It  is  therefore  essential  to  having  a  complete \nunderstanding  of  the  various  costs  associated  with  the  utilization  of  industrial  excess \nheat. In fact, this entails a rethink of our district energy system from both technological \nand investment perspectives (Liu, Park, and Zhong 2020).  \n\nFigure 1: Heat Market as a System with Key Components \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 own elaboration. \n\n \n\nThe value chain of district heating services involves a series of generating, integrating, \nadjusting, transporting, distributing, and consuming processes. Understanding the heat \nmarket  as  a  system  (Figure  1)  from  production  to  distribution  and  from  the  system \nplanning to monitoring can facilitate the identification of energy efficiency opportunities. \nSystem-based screenings of technical and economic assessments usually lay the basis \nfor  the  most  cost-effective  way  to  utilize  excess  heat  in  district  energy  systems.  \nIn  many  cases,  these  assessments  also  contribute  to  developing  sound  policies  \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1203 \n \n\nLiu, Hu, Dean, and Yao \n\nto  support  the  long-term  transformation  of  the  whole  energy  system.  For  example,  \nthe  European  Union\u2019s  Energy  Efficiency  Directive,  endorsed  in  2014,  has  made  it \ncompulsory to use industrial excess heat for district heating when the payback period for \ninvestments is less than four years.  \n\nFrom the technical point of view, in order to improve the energy efficiency of the district \nheating  system,  it  is  important  to  ensure that  the  return  and  supply  temperatures  are  \nas  low  as  possible  while  keeping  the  difference  between  the  supply  and  return \ntemperatures (the cooling) as large as possible (S\u00f6derholm and W\u00e5rell 2011). Changes \nin energy mix may have a large impact on district heating networks\u2019 operations. Various \ncomponents of district heating networks are highly interdependent, both at a plant level \nand as a system. An important feature of the district heating is its operational inter-linkage \nbetween production, distribution, and consumption activities. For example, the level of \nthe  supply  and  return  water  temperatures  can  affect  the  heat  and  electricity  output. \nMaintaining low temperatures can provide several benefits in a district heating system, \nsuch as increased electricity output from CHP plants, improved capacity of heat recovery \nfrom industrial excess heat, an increased coefficient of performance for heat pumps, and \nreduced  distribution  losses  (Energy  Technology  Development  and  Demonstration \nProgram  2014).  Therefore,  economic  performance  across  the  entire  district  heating \nsystem can vary greatly with the control of water temperatures.  \n\nFigure 2: Interconnections of Electricity and Thermal Energy  \nin an Integrated Energy System \n\nSource: Page 15, International Energy Agency (2014). \n\n \n\nMore importantly, utilization of excess heat from industrial sites in local district heating \nnetworks is one technology that can contribute to improving the flexibility of the whole \nenergy  system  (Figure 2). In  an  energy  environment  of  increased  complexity,  flexible \ntechnologies are highly valued: technologies that can rapidly adapt to operating loads, \nabsorb or release energy when needed, or convert a specific final energy into another \nform  of  energy  are  increasingly  important  in  energy  systems  (International  Energy \nAgency 2016b).  \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1203 \n \n\nLiu, Hu, Dean, and Yao \n\nIncreasing integration of fluctuating energy sources, such as renewables from solar and \nwind,  requires  enhancing  the  electricity  grid\u2019s  flexibility.  The  power  system  currently \nrelies heavily on large-scale CHP plants in the northern PRC. The flexibility of the power \ndispatch system is constrained in the winter season since these CHP plants must be run \nto ensure heat supply as a social welfare. This leads to significant curtailment of wind-\ngenerated electricity. One option to provide this much needed flexibility is to use low-\ngrade industrial excess heat to reduce reliance on CHP plants.  \n\nNevertheless, mainstreaming heat planning into a broader energy policy framework is \nchallenging.  In  the  PRC,  cities are  responsible  for  developing  their  own heat policies, \nand  the  implementation  of  heat  planning  reforms  depends  in  large  part  on  local \ngovernment agendas. Meanwhile, the electricity utilities are mainly owned by the central \ngovernment and national champions. Therefore, integrating heat and electricity markets \nrequires a holistic approach.  \n\n2.3  Challenges in the District Heating Market  \n\nIn  this  section,  we  investigate  three  key  challenges  to  investing  in  energy  efficiency \nprojects in district heating systems. These barriers include (1) split incentives between \nproduction,  transmission,  and  distribution  activities;  (2)  third-party  access  to  the  heat \nnetwork; and (3) heat mapping in the energy system planning (Figure 3).  \n\nFigure 3: Key Barriers to Energy Efficiency for District Heating Systems \n\n \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 own elaboration. \n\n2.3.1   Split Incentives  \n\nSplit incentives can occur across several business relationships, when entities capable \nof making improvements have split payoffs and risks, and the entity benefiting from the \nimprovement  has  no  ownership  over  the  long-term  savings.  Indeed,  multiple  split \nincentives exist on both the supply and demand sides of district heating systems that \nprevent the scaling-up of energy efficiency investments (Hu et al. 2017; Liu, Yao, and \nWei 2019).  \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1203 \n \n\nLiu, Hu, Dean, and Yao \n\nSplit Incentives between Heat End-users and Producers  \n\nThe  PRC\u2019s  heat  market  has  been  reformed  to  some  extent  with  consumption-based \nbilling. However, commoditizing heat is not yet fully adopted by the market players and \nconsumers.  Heat  billing  is  largely  based  on  a  flat  energy  cost  per  square  meter \nregardless of the amount of energy consumed or level of comfort. Many employers pay \nemployees\u2019 heating bills as part of the social welfare system (World Bank 2009). Heat \ntariffs are highly regulated to allow low-income consumers to access heating services, \nbut result in heating companies claiming that the current level of heating revenue cannot \nsustain and improve heating services.  \n\nThe Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development (MOHURD) estimated that the \nconsumption-based  billing  area  was  805  million  m2  in  2013,  representing  about  7%  \nof  the  total  building  stock.  The  World  Bank  launched  an  eight-year  implementation \nprogram in 2003. However, the project fell short of its targets for promoting billing based \non heat consumption across the country (World Bank and ESMAP 2012). This partially \nreflects  the  complexity  of  commoditizing  heat  in  the  country\u2019s  social  and  economic \ncontexts.  \n\nIt  is  well  known  that  lower  system  temperatures  in  district  heating  systems  will  lead  \nto saving primary energy consumption (S\u00f6derholm and W\u00e5rell 2011). On the demand \nside,  a  range  of  measures  must  be  put  in  place  to  enable  end-users  to  adapt  to  low \ntemperature  operations.  Some  of  these  examples  include  implementing  underfloor \nheating, fan-convector units, and radiators suitable for low-temperature systems. When \nthe  market  is  unable  to  send  a  price  signal  through  heat  prices,  it  is  impossible  to \nincentivize energy efficiency investments by heat end-users through energy savings.  \n\nSplit Incentives between Heat Companies and Excess Heat Producers \n\nDistrict  heating  companies  have  an  incentive  to  invest  when  they  can  capture  the \nbenefits  of  energy  efficiency  improvement.  When  a  third  party,  such  as  an  industrial \nplant,  accesses  the  district  heating  network,  this  incentive  may  be  split  due  to  the \nseparation  of  distribution  and  production  functions.  From  the  heat  network  operator\u2019s \nperspective,  lowering  the  return  water  temperature  implies  an  extra  cost  for  network \ninfrastructure adjustment. Meanwhile, this will improve the ability to capture excess heat \nfrom industrial plants through larger temperature difference, which will unexpectedly lead \nto higher remuneration for heat producers. When energy efficiency gains cannot pay for \nthe infrastructure improvement investments, heat companies may lose the incentive to \ngive heat network access to excess heat producers (International Energy Agency and \nTsinghua  University \ncore  \nof  the  split  incentive.  Lowering  the  return  water  temperatures  implies  increasing  the \nprofitability of excess heat producers while reducing that of heat companies. This results \nin a clear split incentive regarding the control of return water temperatures.  \n\nFinancial \n\n2015). \n\nreturn \n\noften \n\nthe \n\nat \n\nis \n\nIn order to address this split incentive issue, one solution is to set up a predefined return \nwater  temperature  threshold  in  the  heat  supply  agreement.  Whenever  the  real  return \nwater temperature remains below this threshold, the threshold will be used to calculate \nthe temperature difference to remunerate the heat producer. In such a way, the heating \ncompany\u2019s \ntemperature  will  be  not  \nbe  undermined.  Based  on  a  preliminary  analysis  of  pilot  projects  in  the  PRC,  it  is \nrecommended  to  use  the  temperature  of  44\u00b0C\u201345\u00b0C,  which  can  result  in  a  payback \nperiod  of  3.5  years  for  both  heat  companies  and  excess  heat  producers  (Tsinghua \nUniversity 2018).  \n\nreturn  water \n\nincentive \n\nreduce \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1203 \n \n\n2.3.2   Third-party Access  \n\nLiu, Hu, Dean, and Yao \n\nUnbundling  a  vertically  integrated  utility  company  is  considered  a  key  measure  \nin  liberalizing  the  electricity  market  through  increased  competition.  In  particular, \nproduction is considered suitable for competition in a well-functioning electricity market. \nHowever, this is less common in the heat market because the municipality-owned heat \nutilities  tend  to  prefer  local  heat  producers  and  exclude  third-party  heat  suppliers, \npartially due to geographical constraints.  \n\nAlthough the PRC government has a large stake in district heating systems and heavily \nregulates  heat  tariffs, \nthe  provision  of  heat  services  has  been  progressively \ncommercialized,  and  the  district  heating  market  is  now  becoming  open  to  the  private \nsector.  Similar  to  the  deregulation  of  electricity  and  natural  gas  markets  in  many \ncountries,  the  participation  of  the  private  sector  challenges  the  natural  monopolistic \ncharacteristics  of  municipal-owned  heat  companies  with  more  competition  (Wissner \n2014). \n\nThe government may choose to regulate third party access in a non-discriminatory way. \nThe actual costs of transmission and distribution will vary significantly depending on the \ncharacteristics of local sites. In addition, heat utilities may cross-subsidize transmission \nand distribution activities with inflated production costs. This information gap between \nthe government and heat utilities will further complicate the harmonization of conditions \nand standards regarding third-party access.  \n\n2.3.3   Heat Resources Mapping  \n\nHeat planning is at the center of the interconnected energy system with multiple heat \nsources,  as  the  central  authority  needs  to  guide  the  development  of  local  markets  \nand decisions in order to support regional and national ambitions. Acknowledging this \ninterconnectedness also means implementing policies, incentives, and support to ensure \nadequate guidance on a local level to steer the implementation. \n\nThe heating system is undersized in big municipalities such as Beijing and Tianjin, while \nmostly  larger  than  necessary  to  meet  the  current  heat  demand  in  medium  and  small \nsized  cities.  When  the  heating  system  operates  at  partial  capacity,  costs  are  greater, \nlosses are higher, and service quality suffers. In such a context, there is a need for heat \nplanning  that  accounts  for  available  heat  supply,  current  and  projected heat  demand, \nand system planning priorities. \n\nSince excess heat is a by-product of industrial activities, any industrial policy to reduce \nor shut down energy-intensive industries will affect the availability of heat source supply \nand  impose  uncertainty  on  the  long-term  financial  viability  of  investments.  In  such  a \ncontext, heat planning can greatly help address the uncertainty.  \n\nHeat mapping in the PRC is currently mainly modeled with the consideration of only a \nfew  heating  technologies.  Improved  heat  mapping  should  include  more  detailed \ninformation on the heat demand profile, including building type, size, and weather data. \nImproved  heat  mapping  can  thus  enable  decision-making  on  clean  energy  solutions.  \nA  master  plan  can  be  formulated,  including  technical  and  economic  analysis  of  the  \nheat  potentials  from  excess  heat.  Using  the  master  plan  as  a  reference,  utilities, \nmunicipalities,  and  private  actors  can  propose  business  cases  to  support  the \nimplementation  of  energy  efficiency  investments.  If  a  common  methodology  is  used, \nbusiness cases can be compared and decided upon through an open tendering process, \nensuring  the  development  of  the  district  heating  system  in  the  most  cost-effective \nmanner. \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1203 \n \n\nLiu, Hu, Dean, and Yao \n\n3.  BUSINESS MODELS TO ENHANCE ENERGY \n\nEFFICIENCY OF DISTRICT HEATING  \n\nA business model includes a blend of ownership, financing, and revenue that provides \nvalue to customers. In this section, we suggest three business models: (1) a utility-led \nmodel  with  third-party  access;  (2)  a  heat  production  competition  model;  and  (3)  an \nEnergy  Service  Company  (ESCO)-integrated  model.  We  provide  case  studies  to \nhighlight  the  extent  to  which  each  business  model  has  enabled  energy  efficiency \nfinancing in district heating markets.  \n\n3.1  Utility-led Model with Third-party Access  \n\nDistrict heating is mostly characterized as a natural monopoly due to high fixed costs in \nthe network infrastructure. A single supplier can supply the entire market at a lower cost \nthan several smaller suppliers because of economies of scale. Heat utility companies \ntraditionally  adopt  a  vertically  integrated  structure  to  deliver  production,  transmission, \nand distribution activities. To some extent, a vertically integrated utility has the advantage \nof internalizing the energy efficiency benefits embedded within the system. However, it \nis  noted  that  an  integrated  utility  model  has  some  trade-offs  with  local  public  debt \ncapacity, lack of innovation, and monopoly behavior.  \n\nDistrict heating requires long-term planning and financing, given the high fixed costs. In \nthe PRC, the source of financing for new heating infrastructure traditionally comes from \nconnection  fees  paid  by  real  estate  developers,  the  costs  ultimately  being  passed  on  \nto  heat  end-users.  To  enable  the  integration  of  industrial  excess  heat  in  the  heat \nnetworks,  municipalities  may  need  to  invest  in  laying  additional  pipes  and  renovating \nexisting networks. With a stake in the natural monopoly, municipalities can play a role in \nsecuring the heat market demand through regulations on the connection of existing and \nfuture buildings with a district heating system.  \n\nIn addition, an integrated structure can facilitate a system approach for energy efficiency \nimprovement since the utility will have more incentive to consider the heat system as a \nwhole and not just one heat source. Due to the omnipresent split incentives in the district \nheating  sector,  this  system  approach  can  help  ensure  operational  and  economic \nefficiency in the long run, and pass on benefits of lower heating costs to customers if \nproperly managed.  \n\nIn a utility-led model with third-party access (Figure 4), a heat utility will need to negotiate \nan access agreement with excess heat producers. Since industrial excess heat provides \na low marginal cost of heat supply, a monopolistic heat utility will be able to benefit from \nlowering  its  production  cost  in  exchange  for  totally  or  partially  financing  investments \nassociated with heat source connection, particularly additional network costs. When the \nexcess heat increases the risk of existing heat capacities being replaced, the conditions \nof the third-party access must provide enough incentives for the market entry of new heat \nsources and incentivize utilities\u2019 capital expenditure on energy efficiency improvement \n(International Energy Agency 2016a).  \n\n \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1203 \n \n\nLiu, Hu, Dean, and Yao \n\nFigure 4: Utility-led Business Model with Third-party Access  \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 own elaboration. \n\n \n\nIn this integrated business model, it is essential to provide third-party access to district \nheating  networks  in  a  non-discriminatory  way.  Otherwise,  a  vertically  integrated  heat \nmonopolist often has financial incentives to discriminate against new heat producers and \nto favor its own heat generators. The government will need to encourage the application \nof  integrated  resource  planning  to  look  for  the  most  cost-effective  and  efficient  clean \nsources. \n\nIt is widely recognized that the monopoly market will need outright price regulation. Since \nthe Chinese government provides subsidies to fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas, \nprice  signals  cannot  allow  industrial  excess heat  to  compete  on  an  equal  footing with \nother  fossil  fuels.  Therefore,  heat  utilities  may  lose  their  economic  incentive  to  allow \nnetworks access to the low-cost and clean heat sources.  \n\nHeat  utilities  can  be  required  to  meet  an  energy  efficiency  or  emissions  reduction \nobligation. This market design helps incentivize district heating utilities to negotiate with \nindustrial  facilities  to  deliver  excess  heat  to  the  networks.  Energy  savings  can  be \nexchanged as a commodity through a market-based approach between utilities and other \nenergy  end-users.  Existing  experience  of  the  European  Union\u2019s  Energy  Efficiency \nDirective  shows  that  the  market  is  usually  backed  by  legislation  requiring  utilities  to \nincrease annual energy savings through energy efficiency measures (Euroheat & Power \n2012).  \n\nThe  excess  heat  to  district  heat  project  could  be  partially  financed  by  a  central \ngovernment grant with a requirement for local municipalities to match the provided funds. \nThe use of industrial excess heat in district heating systems often generates significant \nenvironmental  benefits  beyond  the  scope  of  the  municipality  administration.  Central \ngovernment  intervention  in  terms  of  financial  transfer  across  regions  is  necessary  to \ninternalize the benefits of air pollution reduction and emissions reduction.  \n\n \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1203 \n \n\nLiu, Hu, Dean, and Yao \n\nThe  case  of  Qingdao  city  in  the  PRC  provides  an  example.  The  municipality  aims  to \nreplace a coal-dominant energy system with a clean and low-temperature district heating \nnetwork. Instead of coal, Qingdao municipality wishes to use natural gas, solar, ground \ngeothermal, and excess heat recovered from industrial plants to power its district heating \nsystems.  \n\nThe project is implemented by Qingdao Energy Group, wholly owned by the Qingdao \nmunicipality  government.  The  local  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $130  million \nover a 25-year term, including a grace period of five years, from the Asian Development \nBank. Qingdao Energy Group finances $133.6 million through equity contribution. The \nproject  has  installed  small-scale  natural  gas  boilers,  an  excess  heat  recovery  system \nfrom sewage plants and industries, heat pump systems, a solar heating system, a heat \nstorage  system,  and  low-temperature  pipelines  in  eight  locations  across  the  city.  The \nproject is expected to benefit 420,000 people through improved air quality and savings \non \nDevelopment  \nBank 2020). \n\nhousehold \n\nheating \n\n(Asian \n\nbills \n\nTo make use of industrial excess heat, Qingdao municipality imposes a zero-purchase \nprice of industrial excess heat for the purpose of district heating services. Meanwhile, the \nmunicipality government implements energy efficiency standards in buildings and sets a \ncap on its district energy system\u2019s energy consumption. As shown in Table 1, providing \ndistrict heating simply with natural gas, geothermal, and solar thermal technologies will \nlead  to  a  net  financial  loss.  With  the  support  of  zero-cost  industrial  excess  heat,  the \noverall project indicates a financial internal rate of return of 10% because of savings on \nfuel  costs.  In  the  absence  of  industrial  excess  heat,  the  project  would  not  have  been \neconomically viable.  \n\nTable 1: Financial Internal Rate of Return with Various Fuels  \nas Heat Sources in Qingdao Project \n\nHeat Source \n1.

If well managed, this competition \ncan  encourage  energy  efficiency  improvement  and  cost-effective  solutions  for  district \nheating  systems.  Two  general  forms  of  unbundling  exist:  ownership  separation  and \naccounting  separation.  While  ownership  separation  effectively  seeks  to  establish  an \nindependent  network  operator,  the  heat  market  must  be  advanced  enough  to  play  a \nprimary  role  in  pricing  heat  sources  because  the  government\u2019s  role  will  be  limited  to \ncorrecting any market failures through monitoring and prevention of power market abuse \n(World Bank and ESMAP 2012).  \n\n \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1203 \n \n\nLiu, Hu, Dean, and Yao \n\nFigure 5: The Heat Production Competition Business Model \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 own elaboration. \n\n \n\nThis  level  of  maturity  of  the  heat  market  is  not  often  met  in  developing  economies. \nConsequently,  accounting  separation  provides  an  alternative,  in  particular  when  \nthe ownership of heat transmission lines may be fragmented among several parties. The \nregulator  can  require  heat  utilities  to  unbundle  the  accounting  of  production, \ntransmission, and distribution in order to increase the market transparency of network \nsystem  costs.  This  functional  separation  can  help  reinforce  the  competitive  nature  \nof  heat  production.  However,  it  may  not  completely  remove  heat  utilities\u2019  incentive  \nto  impede  third-party  access  to  industrial  excess  heat.  The  regulator  can  determine  \nex-ante  access  provisions.  If  these  preconditions  are  met  by  heat  producers,  the \ntransmission  operator  is  obliged  to  provide  access  to  the  network  (Chittuma  and \n\u00d8stergaarda 2014). \n\nIt is important to define the lowest cost supply requirements and ensure a transparent \nand  non-discriminatory  tendering  process  for  the  procurement  of  heat  sources.  A \npublicly-owned  entity  is  in  charge  of  procuring  heat  from  private  heat  producers  \nand selling heat to distributors to sell on to end-users. This so-called single-buyer model \ncan  help  transition  from  a  vertically  integrated  utility  model  to  full  market-based \ncompetition  in  the  district  heating  market.  Similar  to  the  electricity  market,  this  heat \nproduction  competition  model  must  establish  licensing  rules  to  encourage  private \ninvestments in heat generation and prioritize the lowest-cost heat supply options.  \n\nThe Nordic countries have largely adopted this model in their district heating markets. \nFor  example,  the  main  characteristic  of  the  heat  market  in  Denmark  is  its  non-profit \npolicy. The municipalities own the transmission and distribution networks, but they buy \nheat from CHP, waste incineration plants, and industrial excess heat suppliers. The non-\nprofit policy is expected to make heat utilities charge customers on a cost-covering basis \nand avoid market power abuse. \n\nIn the context of the PRC, significant investments for the extension and retrofit of heat \npipelines  may  be  required  to  exploit  large-scale  industrial  excess  heat.  To  fill  the \nfinancing gap, public-private partnerships (PPP) are a useful tool to unlock private sector \ninvestments. A PPP typically allows a private entity to provide a public service for a period \nof time in exchange for a reasonable financial return. This involves a contract between a \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1203 \n \n\nLiu, Hu, Dean, and Yao \n\npublic sector authority and a private investor. The main purpose of the PPP is to allocate \ntasks and risks to the private sector best able to manage them (ESMAP 2008). \n\nThe experience of Anshan city in the PRC provides some meaningful insights. Anshan \ncity  has  seen  the  heat  market  traditionally  dominated  by  a  few  dispersed  public  and \nprivate district heating companies. District heating has relied heavily on inefficient coal \nboilers. On the other hand, the city hosts, Angang, one of the largest steel producers in \nthe  country.  The  city  has  decided  to  tap  into  1GW  potential  of  industrial  excess  heat \nproduced  by  the  Angang  steel  plant  to  heat  50  million  m2  of  building  floor  area, \nrepresenting  70%  of  the  total  heating  area.  To  achieve  this  target,  there  is  a  need  to \ndevelop a new transmission line to capture excess heat from the Angang steel plant and \nintegrate it into the heat networks. Under a PPP framework, this transmission line has \nbeen invested in 60% by the government-owned Qianfeng district heating company and \n40%  by  Fu  An,  a  private  company.  The  transmission  line  is  expected  to  connect \ngeothermal  resources  and  two  CHP  plants  with  the  heat  networks  in  the  future.  Coal \nboilers  are  expected  to  be  used only  occasionally  to  meet  peak  load  demand.  In  this \ncase, the partnership between the municipality and the private sector has succeeded in \nunlocking  investment  in  the  transmission  lines,  which  has  enabled  the  utilization  of \nindustrial excess heat from the steel manufacturing process which would otherwise have \nbeen wasted (United Nations Environment Programme 2015).  \n\n3.3  ESCO-integrated Business Model  \n\nAn  ESCO  can  drive  private  investments  in  energy  efficiency  by  linking  heating \ncompanies  and  industries  (Figure  6).  This  business  model  typically  uses  an  energy \nperformance contract (EPC) to implement an energy efficiency project. The cost saving \nderived  from  energy  efficiency  improvement  is  the  source  of  the  ESCO\u2019s  revenue  \nto repay the project investment. In this business structure, the ESCO needs to negotiate \nwith industrial excess heat producers, the heat utility, and potential third-party financiers.  \n\nFigure 6: The ESCO-integrated Business Model \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 own elaboration. \n\nThe private sector plays a leading role in enabling this business model. An ESCO can \ncreate an agreement with an excess heat provider through either a shared savings or \n\n \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1203 \n \n\nLiu, Hu, Dean, and Yao \n\nguaranteed  savings  contract.  Under  a  shared  savings  contract,  the  costs savings  are \nsplit according to a predefined percentage, while under a guaranteed savings contract, \nthe  ESCO  guarantees  a  certain  level  of  energy  savings.  One  important  difference \nbetween the two models is that the performance guarantee is the level of energy saved, \nwhile  shared  savings  are  based  on  the  cost  of  energy  saved  (International  Energy \nAgency 2014). \n\nOver  the  last years,  ESCO  investment  in  the  PRC  has  increased  by  around  30%  per \nyear to reach 53 billion euros (371 billion yuan) and achieve annual energy savings of \n124 million tons of standard coal equivalent. The number of ESCO firms has increased \nsixfold, from 782 in 2010 to 5,426 in 2015, creating cumulatively 607,000 jobs in 2015 \ncompared  to  175,000  in  2010  (International  Energy  Agency  2016b).  However,  the \ndevelopment of ESCOs in the district heating market is still at an initial stage, partially \ndue to the market challenges outlined earlier.  \n\nIt is worth noting that although an ESCO is usually wholly owned by the private sector, \nthe  government\u2019s  role  is  still  important  in  removing  regulatory  and  policy  barriers  by \naddressing split incentives and facilitating access to finance (Retallack et al. 2018). Due \nto  the  supply  uncertainty of  excess heat as  an  industrial  by-product,  ESCOs  face  the \nchallenge  of  mobilizing  long-term  financing  from  commercial  sources.  In  many cases, \nESCOs request the local government\u2019s guarantee to secure project financing. \n\nRegarding the ESCO financing options, ESCOs assume all performance and technical \nrisks  under  a  guaranteed  savings  contract.  For  this  reason,  ESCOs  rarely  cover  the \ninvestment repayment risk, and so the project is typically financed by industries through \ncorporate  or  project  finance.  The  investment  payment  schedule  may  be  adjusted \naccording to the level of savings: the higher the savings, the quicker the repayment. If \nthe  guaranteed  savings  are  not  achieved,  the  ESCO  has  to  cover  the  debt  service \ndifference.  In  a  newly  established  ESCO  market,  most  actors  may  not  have  enough \ncredit history to secure financing with their own balance sheets. In contrast, under the \nshared  savings  contract,  which  shifts  partial  performance  risk  to  industry,  an  ESCO  \nis  more  likely  to  provide  third-party  financing  or  co-invest  with  industry.  It  therefore \nassumes  both  the  performance  and  the  underlying  customer  credit  risk  (International \nEnergy Agency 2014).  \n\nThe  PRC\u2019s heat  market  provides some  interesting ESCO  cases.  For  instance,  Qianxi \ndistrict is an area with a population of around 390,000 and located in the eastern part of \nTangshan city. District heating has historically been fueled by coal-fired boilers. Growth \nin buildings\u2019 floor area has put upward pressure on the heat supply, while Qianxi has \nbeen facing restrictions on coal consumption due to the emissions reduction target.  \n\nA demonstration project was developed in Qianxi in 2014 to recycle excess heat from \ntwo new steel plants for the purpose of district heating. The project aims to reuse three \ncategories of industrial excess heat\u2014the cooling water of the blast furnace, the flushing \nwater  of  blast  furnace  slag,  and  mixed steam  from  basic  oxygen  furnaces  and  rolling \nheating furnaces. It is estimated that the potential of this excess heat source can amount \nto around 217 MW, which is able to serve the heat baseload through to 2030.  \n\nThe Qianxi Heran Energy Conservation Company created a joint venture with the local \ngovernment. This newly established district heating company concluded a concession \nagreement with the local district heating agency; it also established a long-term contract \nwith  steel  plants  to  purchase  industrial  excess  heat.  The  ESCO  then  signed  \nan  EPC  contract  with  the  district  heating  network  operator  using  the  shared  savings \napproach.  The  ESCO  was  in  charge  of  providing  third-party  finance  for  project \ninvestments.  \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1203 \n \n\nLiu, Hu, Dean, and Yao \n\nThe  project  has  planned  three  phases.  The  total  investment  for  the  first  phase  is \napproximately 283 million RMB, including excess heat transmission pipelines within the \nsteel  plants  and  beyond,  heat  recovery  equipment,  and  a  new  heating  station.  The \nsecond and third phases are expected to cost an additional 51 million and 110 million \nRMB,  respectively.  Once  completed,  the  project  is  expected  to  reduce  annual  district \nheating costs by around 63 million RMB by 2030. The overall project\u2019s payback period \nis estimated to be seven years (International Energy Agency 2016b).  \n\n4.  PRICING INDUSTRIAL EXCESS HEAT \n\nIn  the  PRC,  pricing  industrial  excess  heat  is  not  an  easy  task.  Firstly,  the  presence  \nof  fossil  fuel  subsidies  prevents  the  market  from  sending  high  energy  price  signals. \nSecondly, \ninterlinking  of  economic  performance  among  production, \ntransmission,  and  distribution  activities  further  complicates  the  pricing  mechanism  to \ntranslate the system benefits across district heating market players. In this section, we \nsuggest four options for pricing industrial excess heat: \n\nthe  close \n\n1.  Estimating system costs  \n\n2.  Free-cost excess heat  \n\n3.  Establishing clean heat targets  \n\n4.  Indexing against the next best alternative \n\n4.1  Option 1: Estimating System Costs  \n\nThe first option is to regulate the price of excess heat with a systemic approach. This \nrequires  a  holistic  consideration  of  fixed  and  variable  costs,  back-up  system  costs, \nbalancing costs, the potential impact on CHP plants, and the integration of renewable \nenergy (Liu, Park, and Zhong 2020).  \n\nSpecifically,  the  production  costs  reflect  investment  cost,  fuel  cost,  operation  and \nmaintenance  costs,  and  indirect  costs  such  as  environmental  externalities  due  to  air \nquality damage (SO2, NOX, and PM2.5) and CO2 emissions.  \n\nThe network cost is typically related to transmission and distribution, which depend highly \non distance and heat density, respectively. Similarly, temperature requirements, network \nlayout, and size have a significant impact on the network cost.  \n\nSystem integration costs include the cost of new heat and electricity infrastructure, the \ncost  of  integrating  intermittent  renewables  into  the  energy  system,  and  the  cost  of \nbalancing  unpredictable  heat  and  power  sources.  System  costs  are  collectively \ndetermined by the configuration of the heat and electricity systems, and the penetration \nlevel of excess heat. \n\n \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1203 \n \n\nLiu, Hu, Dean, and Yao \n\nFigure 7: The Heat Market Production Cost Structure \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 own elaboration. \n\nFigure 8: The Heat Market Network Cost Structure \n\nTransmission cost  \n\nDistance \n\nTemperature  \n\nNetwork layout   \n\nHeat network cost\n\nDistribution  cost  \n\nHeat density  \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 own elaboration. \n\nFigure 9: The Heat Market System Integration Cost Structure \n\nHeat system cost  \n\nBack-up system cost    \n\nEnergy system cost \n\nElectricity system cost  \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 own elaboration. \n\n4.2  Option 2: Free-cost Excess Heat \n\nWhen  the  government  is  not  ready  for,  or  not  capable  of,  quantifying  the  costs  and \nbenefits from the system perspective, an intermediate approach entails implementing a \nfree-cost  policy,  as  the  excess  heat  is  viewed  as  a  by-product  of  the  industrial \nmanufacturing process.  \n\nBalancing cost   \n\nHeat capacity cost   \n\nCHP flexibility     \n\nRenewable  integration     \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1203 \n \n\nLiu, Hu, Dean, and Yao \n\nAs illustrated in section 3.1, district heating utilities can make use of free-cost excess \nheat to integrate more options for clean heat sources. Given the high capital costs of \nheat  networks,  this  free-cost  policy  can  help  strengthen  the  financial  viability  of  the \ninvestments made by a natural monopolistic heat utility. Meanwhile, the government may \nconsider establishing an energy efficiency obligation and/or a clean energy target. With \na no-profit and social equity objective, this option can further allow the financial gains \nderived  from  the  utilization  of  free-cost  excess  heat  to  be  passed  on  to  heat  \nend-users.  \n\n4.3  Option 3: Establishing Clean Heat Targets  \n\nFor the third option, the government can create a market-based instrument by setting an \nobligation on heating companies to diversify clean heat sources. This will incentivize heat \ncompanies  to  explore  the  most  cost-effective  clean  heat  sources.  Similar  to  the  EU \nEmissions  Trading  System  or  Green  Certificates  for  renewable  energy,  clean  heat \ntargets enable a price signal of industrial excess heat to be sent to market players.  \n\nTo  date,  over  23  cities  in  the  PRC  have  committed  to  achieving  the  peak  of  their \nemissions earlier than the country-wide target. They have formed an Alliance of Peaking \nPioneer Cities that together represent one-quarter of the PRC\u2019s urban carbon emissions. \nImproving the efficiency of the district energy systems is a major policy initiative to meet \nthese cities climate change commitment.  \n\n4.4  Option 4: Indexing Against the Next Best Alternative  \n\nExcess heat is typically explored to replace a more expensive fuel that would otherwise \nhave been used in district heating networks. The price of this alternative fuel can provide \na  good  metric against  which  the  excess heat  price  is  benchmarked.  The heat  market \nmust monitor heat production costs to establish the reference price for industrial excess \nheat. \n\nWhile  an  alternative  heat  source  in  the  counterfactual  scenario  may  not  be  easily \ndiscovered, the regulator can also price industrial excess heat as a proportion of the least \nexpensive heat production cost. To mitigate excessive fluctuation of excess heat prices, \nthe regulator can set price caps below which the price setting will be more driven by the \nmarket and less reliant on regulatory oversight (Euroheat & Power 2012).  \n\n4.5  Impact of Industrial Excess Heat on District Heating Prices  \n\nOpening  the  heat  market  to  excess  heat  producers  will  increase  competition  and \nincentivize more investments in energy efficiency. However, the extent to which the price \nof consumers\u2019 heating will change remains an open question. The size of the heat market \nand  the  number  of  competing  firms  are  important  in  choosing  an  appropriate  pricing \npolicy (S\u00f6derholm and W\u00e5rell 2011).  \n\nIn the PRC, the district heat sector is highly fragmented with many local heat suppliers. \nConsolidation  of  district  heating  within  and  across  cities  is  expected  to  bring  about \nbenefits of economy of scale and optimize the dispatch of clean heat sources. Indeed, \nthe  entry  of  new  market  players  can  increase  the  market  competition.  Nevertheless, \nwhen  the  competition  is  limited  by  the  presence  of  a  few  dominant  market  players, \nheating utilities may have a strong incentive to inflate the system costs of introducing \nindustrial excess heat in order to cross-subsidize their own production and distribution \nactivities (S\u00f6derholm and W\u00e5rell 2011). \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1203 \n \n\nLiu, Hu, Dean, and Yao \n\nMost  cities  in  the  PRC  apply  a  fair  rate  of  return  policy  with  two  pricing  components:  \na  regulated  network  price  and  a  market  price  for  the  delivered  heat  (S\u00f6derholm  \nand  W\u00e5rell  2011).  This  two-part  pricing  structure  has  the  advantage  of  reconciling \nproduction efficiency and financing incentives.  \n\nOn  the  one  hand,  the  increasing  penetration  of  industrial  excess  heat  in  the  district \nheating network can lower the marginal cost of heat supply. These savings in operational \ncosts  are  expected  to  put  downward  pressure  on  heat  prices.  On  the  other  hand, \nintroducing industrial excess heat may imply additional costs of retrofitting and balancing \nheat  networks.  The  net  heat  prices  may  still  increase  as  a  result  of  capital-intensive \ninfrastructure investments.  \n\n5.  CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nExamining the heat market as a system enables the identification of system opportunities \nand challenges for investments in energy efficiency. We identify three business models \nto enable increased financing for low-grade excess heat utilization. Getting the heat tariff \nright  is  essential  for  translating  the  system  benefits  into  market  value.  The  following \npolicy implications arise from our analysis.  \n\nFirstly, the government authority should make low-grade excess heat visible in energy \nstatistics. For this, there is a need to develop a guideline to help local authorities assess \nand report the potential for district heating and any additional costs of using excess heat. \nHeat resource mapping is expected to identify industrial clusters and assess heat supply \nand demand across regions. This will allow the assessment of transmission distances \nbetween excess heat producers and district heating networks.  \n\nSecondly, the PRC should enhance utilization of low-grade excess heat as a structural \nenergy  efficiency  measure.  The  national  energy  authority  can  develop  a  guideline  on \ncost-benefit  analysis  of  a  range  of  clean  heat  solutions.  The  country  must  consider \nmultiple  options  for  integrating  heat  and  power  sectors  so  that  the  system  costs  and \nbenefits can be better understood. This will support the market with a scientifically sound \nanalysis to promote improvement in the energy efficiency of district heating. \n\nThirdly, the government needs to improve third-party access to district heating networks. \nThe key measures include promoting transparency of heat network pricing, reinforcing \nthe  competition  of  heat  production,  and  improving  PPP  concession  bidding.  It  is  also \nimportant to establish least-cost heat procurements and enhance investors\u2019 appetite for \nclean heat options.  \n\nLast but not least, the government will need to review current public support measures \nfor investments in energy-efficient district heating. Given the inherent uncertainty arising \nfrom industrial excess heat and complex institutional arrangements, the government may \nprovide \nenabling  \nthe  private  sector  to  access  commercial  loans.  The  policy  package  also  includes \nharmonization of the pricing policies related to air pollutants, carbon emissions, and fossil \nfuel subsidies.  \n\nrisk-sharing \n\nguarantee \n\nfacilities, \n\nfunds \n\nthus \n\nor \n\nAlthough  our  study  focuses  specifically  on  the  PRC,  the  policy  and  financing  issues \npresent global opportunities to improve energy efficiency in district energy systems. For \nfuture research, market mechanisms to integrate heat and power sectors for improved \nenergy efficiency merit further investigation. \n\n \n\n \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1203 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nLiu, Hu, Dean, and Yao \n\nAsian Development Bank. 2020. \u201cQingdao Smart Low-Carbon District Energy Project.\u201d \n\nAccessed 15 October 2020. https://www.adb.org/projects/48003-002/main. \n\nChittuma, A., and P.

This  \nstudy aims to draw policy insights into the PRC\u2019s field experience of overcoming barriers to \nenergy efficiency financing. Firstly, we investigate split incentives, third-party access, and lack \nof  heat  resource  mapping  as  key  barriers  to  investing  in  district  heating  energy  efficiency \nprojects. Second, to enable energy efficiency financing, we analyze three business models: a \nutility-led model with third-party access, a heat production competition model, and an energy \nservice  company  model.  The  business  model  choice \nlarge  part  depends  on  \nthe integration level of production, transmission, and distribution activities in a given district \nheating system. Third, the heat prices must signal new investments in district heating capacity \nadequacy. We suggest four options for excess heat pricing, including system cost, free cost, \na quantity target for clean heating, and indexing against the next best alternative. Finally, we \nconclude  with  policy  implications  to  scale  up  energy  efficiency  financing  in  district  heating. \nAlthough  the  analysis  is  specific  for  the  PRC,  the  policy  and  financing  issues  are  global \nopportunities to improve energy efficiency in district energy systems. \n \nKeywords: energy efficiency, district energy system, district heating, excess heat \n \nJEL Classification: Q48, H32 \n \n", "in \n", " \n"]}
