INTRODUCTION \nGovernment and private sector incentives to invest in renewable energy have grown as \na way of reducing fossil fuel dependency and environmental damage. Due to these \nnew investments, the renewable energy field has seen vast growth in recent years. In \nthe field of solar electricity in particular, the annual solar PV electricity production \nincreased  from  4  TWh  in  2005  to  247  TWh  in  2015  (IEA  2017).  Moreover,  the \naccumulated solar electricity plant capacity grew from 100,504 MW in 2012 to 368,000 \nMW in 2017 (Figure 1). One of the factors supporting this growth in the solar electricity \nsector is the reduction in the cost of solar modules.  \nFigure 1: Worldwide Growth in Cumulative Capacity of Solar Photovoltaics  \nfrom 1992 to 2017 \n \nNote: Cumulative capacity of solar photovoltaics from 1992 to 2017 in MW. Created by writer using data collected from \nthe Global Market Outlook for Solar Power 2016\u20132020, 2015\u20132019, 2014\u20132018 and Snapshot of Global PV 1992\u20132014.  \nKimura and Zissler (2016) have carried out a comparison of solar PV prices in Japan \nand Germany. Their study analyzed solar PV system costs. Their comparison of solar \nPV cost (50 kW or more and less than 500 kW) in 2015 showed that module cost \nmakes up about 30% to 40% of the system price in Japan and 50% in Germany. \nTherefore, the price of solar modules plays a large part in solar system prices. As can \nbe seen in Figure 2, the price of solar modules has seen a huge drop worldwide in \nrecent  years.  The  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  which  dominates  the  solar \nmodule market today, saw a reduction from $5,810/kW in 2007 to $570/kW in 2015 and \nless  than  $350/kW  in  2017.  However,  a  global  comparison  shows  that  there  are \ndifferences  in  the  speed  of  cost  reduction.  For  example,  Japan  saw  a  drop  from \n$3,700/kW in 2007 to $1,140/kW in 2015. Here, the module price in Japan was initially \ncheaper than that in the PRC. However, in 2015, the module price in Japan was twice \nthat of the PRC. To encourage the installation of solar electricity, analyzing the factors \ninfluencing the price reduction in solar photovoltaic modules is crucial. Although many \nresearches  have  been  carried  out  analyzing  the  price  of  solar  modules,  all  have \nfocused  on  the  supply  factor,  especially  the  technological  factors  of  the  solar \nphotovoltaic market price. Therefore, in this paper, we will consider the economic \nfactors of the solar module market with a view to accurately identifying the factors \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 836  Taghizadeh-Hesary et al. \n \nbehind price changes in solar modules. Section 2 discusses past researches related to \npotential factors influencing the solar module price reduction mechanism. The potential \nfactors  include  learning  by  doing,  R&D  expenditure,  oil  price,  and  exchange  rate. \nSection 3 will clarify the process of creating our solar module pricing model, which \nincludes  wage,  interest  rate,  exchange  rate,  R&D  expenditure,  and  oil  price  as \nexplanatory variables, and module price as the independent variable. We will assume \nan oligopolistic market. Section 4 presents data analysis. Taking into consideration the \nresults  of  the  data  analysis,  fully  modified  OLS  (FMOLS)  will  be  conducted  for \nregression. This will be followed by the empirical results on the relationship between \nsolar module price, wage, interest rate, exchange rate, R&D expenditure, and oil price. \nSection  5  presents  a  conclusion  and  policy  implications.  We  will  conclude  that \ngovernment efforts to increase financing channels and R&D expenditures toward solar \nphotovoltaics will be needed to accelerate solar system installation. \n2.  LITERATURE SURVEY \n2.1  Overview of Solar Module Price \nThe solar module price changes in the five countries of the PRC, Germany, Japan, the \nRepublic of Korea, and the United States are summarized in Figure 2. Overall, from \n1992 to 2015, solar module prices decreased due to technological advances. By the \nearly 2000s, the solar module price for the four countries of Germany, Japan, the \nRepublic of Korea, and the United States had decreased to approximately 50%\u201370% \nsince 1992. However, these four countries saw sudden increases in solar module price \nfrom 2004. This can be explained by the increase in crude oil prices.1 Figure 3 shows \nthat crude oil prices started to rise in the early 2000s. With the increase in oil prices, \nthe demand for alternative energy increased, and thus the price of solar modules. \nMoreover, in 2004, Germany saw a relatively sudden increase in solar module price \nfrom $3.7 per watt in 2004 to $7.4 per watt in 2005. This can be explained by the \nrevision  of  the  feed-in  tariff  (FIT)  policy.  In  2004,  Germany  passed  the  German \nRenewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) 2004, which increased photovoltaic FIT price \nsetting and made the policy applicable to solar PV systems larger than 1,000 MW \n(Ministry of the Environment 2015). This rise in solar FIT price setting and policy target \nexpansion increased electricity suppliers\u2019 demand for renewable electricity equipment, \nresulting in the growth of annual solar PV installation from 0.14 GW in 2003 to 0.67 GW \nin 2004 (Figure 3). This increase in demand may account for the sudden increase in \nsolar module price in Germany. Solar modules reverted to the declining trend from \n2008 with solar module prices dropping to $3.5 per watt in 2009. This can be explained \nby another revision of the FIT in 2009 with the passing of EEG 2009. EEG 2009 \nannounced that the FIT price degression rate would be increased and the price setting \nwould be determined based on the annual solar PV installment in the previous year. \nThis reduced the incentive for electricity suppliers to expand solar PV systems, thereby \nreducing both the demand for, and price of, solar modules. Japan introduced its FIT \npolicy in 2012. This led to an increase in solar module installation from 2013. The \nannual solar PV installation more than quadrupled from 1.718 GW in 2012 to 6.967 GW \nin 2013. However, unlike in Germany under EEG 2004, the price of solar modules has \ncontinued to decrease in Japan since the introduction of the feed-in tariff. There are \nseveral possible explanations for this. First, the average price of crude oil started to \ndecrease from 2012. In response, solar module prices have decreased due to the \n                                                 \n1  For more information on the reasons behind the oil price increases in the 2000s see Taghizadeh-Hesary \nand Yoshino (2014) and Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary (2014; 2015; 2016). \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 836  Taghizadeh-Hesary et al. \n \nenergy substitution relationship between renewable energy and oil. Another reason is \nthe difference in FIT policy management. The FIT policy in Japan is based on that of \nEuropean countries such as Germany. With the precedent of Germany, it was not \ndifficult to see that FIT overpricing led to excessive demand in solar modules and \nincreases in both solar module prices and electricity prices. Therefore, the FIT levy for \nsolar PV in Japan was set at 0.22 yen/kWh, lower than the levy under EGG 2004 of \n0.51  eurocent/kWh  (REI  2017).  Therefore,  the  influence  of  FIT  on  solar  module \ndemand was smaller in Japan than in Germany.  \nFigure 2: Price Change in Solar Modules for the Top Five Producing Countries \nfrom 1992 to 2015 \n \nNote: Price of solar modules for top six solar module producing countries in watts. Country ranking of solar module \nproduction is computed using the solar module production data provided by the IEA-PVPS reports from 1997 to 2016. \nPrice data for solar modules are also collected from the IEA-PVPS reports from 1997 to 2016. The data for Malaysia, \nwhich was the fourth biggest solar module producer from 1997 to 2016, were not available. \nFigure 3: Annual Solar Power Installation in Germany and Japan \n \nNote: Annual increase and decrease in net installed solar electricity generation capacity in Germany from 2002 to 2016 \nin GW.

The learning \ncurve effect is a trend in manufacturing where the manufacturing process becomes \nmore efficient as it produces more units Arrow (1962). Wright (1936) refers to this  \ntrend as the learning-by-doing effect. Neij, Anderson, and Durstewitz (1997) performed  \ncase studies on wind power and concluded that experience curves are applicable  \nto energy conversion technologies such as solar PV. Many past researchers have \ncreated multiple models revolving around the learning curve to analyze solar module \ncosts for the benefit of solar photovoltaic development. Messener (1998) created a \nlearning curve model applicable to energy systems. Messener\u2019s model was created  \nto analyze the influence of technological change. This model became the basis of \nlearning curves in energy technology and was later extended to what is called the  \nERIS (Energy Research and Investment Strategy) model (Barreto et al. 2000). Pillai \n(2015)  created  a  cost  reduction  model  including  cumulative  capacity,  plant  size, \npolysilicon price, polysilicon usage, firm efficiency, PRC dummy, and investment as \nexplanatory variables.  \nSome research has focused on the mechanism of the learning-by-doing effect. Bahk \nand Gort (1993) categorized learning by doing into three categories of labor, capital, \nand organization to explain the mechanism of learning by doing. Nemet (2005) came \nup with a solar module pricing model including various variables representing different \nlearning-by-doing effect channels to pinpoint which processes of manufacturing show a \nlearning-by-doing effect. McDonald and Schrattenholzer (2000) estimated the learning \nrates for various energy conversion technologies including solar photovoltaic modules \nusing energy technology models. \nAs Glachant, Meniere, and Arnaud (2013) state in their paper, the experience curve \neffect plays a huge part in both the government\u2019s renewable energy policy discussions \nand solar PV manufacturing. However, there are researches questioning the validity of \nusing learning by doing in empirical analysis. Nemet (2005) tackled the fundamental \nassumption that the learning-by-doing effect has a critical impact on the solar module \ncost reduction process. He used six cost reduction factors, i.e. module efficiency, plant \nsize, yield, polycrystalline share, silicon consumption, and wafer size, to create a model \nof photovoltaic module price reduction. He concluded that learning by doing accounts \nfor less than 10% of overall cost reduction. He went on to say that to make realistic \ndecisions in the solar photovoltaic industry, knowledge spillovers and market dynamics \nmust  be  considered.  Similarly,  Sallenave  (1985)  states  in  his  paper  that  although \nlearning  curves  can  be  useful  for  companies  in  competitive  analysis,  the  learning \ncurves do not serve as a reliable cost forecasting system because it is subject to many \nconstraints. Schaeffer et al. (2004) state that the learning curve must be used with care \nas there are many data uncertainties in the energy sector.  \nThe set of researches focusing on the technological aspect of price reduction has been \nthe center of various renewable energy policies. However, the fundamental assumption \nthat learning by doing should be included in energy technology prices may need to  \nbe reconsidered as production itself is a function of many different variables. As was \nmentioned in Nemet (2005), consideration of market dynamics may give new insights \ninto the price reduction process. Taking this into account, this paper will add economic \nperspectives to the analysis of solar photovoltaic module price. In other words, the \nexplanatory variables used in this paper will break down production into a function of \nseveral economic factors and market dynamics will be considered in the process of \nmodel production. \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 836  Taghizadeh-Hesary et al. \n \n2.3  R&D Expenditure in the Solar Industry  \nR&D expenditure in the solar energy sector has been growing globally. The global solar \nR&D expenditure in 2016 totaled 3.6 billion dollars (Bloomberg 2017). To expand the \ninstallation of solar energy technologies, both the public sector and corporations have \nbeen increasing investment in solar R&D. Under this trend, the influence of R&D \nexpenditure on technology price reduction has been an important topic. In solar module \nprice researches, the effect of R&D expenditure has been taken into consideration as \nan extension of learning-by-doing effect models to better understand the mechanism of \ncost  reduction.  There  have  been  multiple  solar  module  pricing  models  with  R&D \nexpenditure as explanatory variable that are an extension of the ERIS model (Miketa \nand Schrattenholzer 2004; Barreto and Kypreos 2004). Glachant, Meniere, and Arnaud \n(2013)  created  an  experience  curve  model  using  cumulative  production,  R&D \nknowledge stock, and input price to predict module prices in 2020. Among the studies \nof renewable energy R&D, there are also researches that focus on different types  \nof R&D in price analysis. Youah (2013) used different types of data set for R&D \nexpenditures to see which best fits the learning curve model. Youah compared the use \nof R&D expenditure by itself and the accumulation of R&D expenditure as explanatory \nvariables to see which fits the trend in solar module price reduction better. The results \nshowed that accumulation of R&D expenditure was superior in identifying the price \nmechanism of solar modules. Hayamizu, Furubayashi, and Nakata (2014) compared \nthe  difference  between  the  effect  of  public  solar  R&D  expenditure  and  corporate  \nsolar R&D expenditure in Japan and concluded that the influence of corporate solar \nR&D expenditure on solar module price is stronger than that of public solar R&D \nexpenditure. Although it is commonly assumed that R&D expenditure results in cost \nreduction, recent research points out that R&D expenditure has limitations as a variable \nfor price determination. Shimamoto, Ueta, and Kokubu (2017) performed an analysis \non the use of R&D expenditure in econometric analysis. R&D expenditure does not \nalways show results, therefore the use of R&D expenditure as a variable to explain \ntechnological advances may give misleading results. In this case the use of patents as \na variable may be an option as patents are direct results of R&D. Patents, however, \nhave specific purposes and converting them into a figure that considers the value of \neach patent in terms of the level of technological advances is still difficult. They also \npoint out that the objective of R&D expenditure varies and thus the influence of R&D on \ntechnology price may be hard to identify just as patents. For example, in a country with \nstronger environmental regulations, R&D expenditure may not result in an increased \nrenewable  energy  technology  price.  Rather,  expenditure  on  quality  enhancement  \nmay increase the price of renewable energy technology. Taking this into account, \ntechnological advancement does not always lead to price reduction or the market \nsuperiority that comes with it.  \n2.4  Relationship between Oil Prices and Renewable Energy \nRenewable energy was developed as a substitute for oil. The transition from oil-based \nenergy to renewable energy was backed up by an increase in oil price and a global \ntrend toward a sustainable society. Figure 4 summarizes the oil price changes from \n1990 to 2015. Ever since 2002, the world has seen sudden increases in oil prices. As \noil  prices  have  increased,  the  demand  for  alternative  energy  has  also  increased. \nTherefore, in renewable price analysis, the influence of oil prices cannot be ignored, \nwhich is the so-called \u201cprimary\u201d or \u201csubstitution effect.\u201d There is also a secondary effect \nof oil on the price of PV. Oil or energy is considered a production input alongside labor \nand capital. When the price of oil or energy rises, the production cost will increase, \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 836  Taghizadeh-Hesary et al. \n \nwhich pushes the price of PV upward.2 An empirical study by Brunnschweiler (2009) \nbacks this up. The results show that an increase in oil price has a positive influence on \nrenewable energy consumption. Papandreou and Ruzzenenti (2015) performed an \nanalysis of the influence that fossil fuel price has on low carbon energy systems. Their \ndiscussion suggests that maintaining oil price played a role in smoothing the transition \nto a sustainable energy system. Cheon and Urpelainen (2012) carried out an empirical \nanalysis on the influence oil price has on technological advances in renewable energy. \nThe analysis shows that an increase in oil prices results in the increase of factors such \nas public renewable R&D expenditure and renewable patents. Similar results can be \nfound from a work by Wong, Chia, and Chang. (2013). They conducted an analysis on \nthe elasticity of energy R&D in relation to changes in oil prices. Their results showed \nthat oil price has positive correlations to renewable R&D. Therefore, increases in oil \nprices may accelerate technological advances. As noted in Section 2.2, increases in \nR&D are commonly known to lower prices of renewable technologies. Therefore, an \nincrease in oil price will increase R&D expenditure and in turn lower the price of solar \nmodules.  However,  the  impact  that  lower  oil  prices  have  on  renewable  energy \ntechnologies depends on the scale and location of the project (Terrado, Mendis, and \nFitzgerald 1988). \nFigure 4: Daily Change in Crude Oil Price from 2 January 2005  \nto 30 December 2017 \n \nNote: WTI crude oil price is West Texas Intermediate, Cushing, Oklahoma Spot Price, Free on Board (US$ per barrel). \nBrent crude oil price is Europe Brent Spot Price FOB (Dollars per Barrel).

For more information about the impact of \noil prices on macroeconomic variables see Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino (2015) and Taghizadeh-\nHesary et al. (2013, 2016), and for more information about the mechanisms of the transmission of oil \nprices at micro level (households and firms) see: Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino (2016); Taghizadeh-\nHesary et. al (2016; 2017).  \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 836  Taghizadeh-Hesary et al. \n \n2.5  Different Channels of Exchange Rate Influencing  \nSolar Module Price \nThere are two main channels through which the exchange rate has an influence on \nsolar module price: material imports and oil imports. First, through the importation of \nsolar module materials, the manufacturing cost of solar modules is influenced by the \nexchange rate. The raw material of a solar module is polysilicon. Polysilicon is first \nprocessed into silicon ingots, which are then sliced into silicon wafers. These silicon \nwafers  are  integrated  into  solar  cells,  which  function  as  the  fundamental  energy \nconversion units. Finally, the solar cells are put together into solar modules. In the \nprocess of manufacturing solar modules, there are two main international transactions \nto be noted, i.e. the importation of solar cells and silicon (Figure 5). There have been \nprecedent works on the influence of the material cost on solar module prices. Nemet \n(2005) used a model with polysilicon as an independent variable and solar module \nprice as the dependent variable. The results showed that silicon cost explains about \n12% of the learning-by-doing effect. Similarly, an empirical analysis by Pillai (2014) \nshowed that a 1% drop in silicon price accounts for a 0.9% drop in solar module prices. \nTherefore, both the price of materials and the strength of each country\u2019s national \ncurrency,  which  influences  the  material  import  costs,  have  an  influence  on  solar \nmodule price. The second channel is through the changes in oil import prices. The \ntechnological advancement in renewable energy has been backed up by the price \nincrease in crude oil and the global trend toward a sustainable society. Therefore, the \nexchange rate will also influence solar modules indirectly by influencing oil price. \nFigure 5: Solar Module Manufacturing Process \n \nNote: Manufacturing process of solar modules from raw material of polysilicon to solar photovoltaic modules. \n2.6  Overview of Renewable Energy Loans \nThe renewable energy industry is considered high-tech and capital-intensive as it takes \ntime to recoup investment. The influence of interest rate on renewable technology \ndevelopment has been discussed in past researches. A discussion note by the Council \non  Economic  Policies  (CEP)  analyzes  the  influence  of  low  interest  on  renewable \nenergy technology (Monnin 2015). Monnin states that long-term interest rates play an \nimportant role in energy investments. His analysis showed that the impact of changes \nin interest rate is stronger on green energy technology costs than on brown energy \ncosts. Therefore, the interest rate not only influences renewable energy technology \ncost but the relative competitiveness between green and brown technology. Similarly, \nresearch by Brunnschweiler (2009) shows that development in the financing sector has \na significant impact on renewable technology development. The research included an \nempirical analysis on the relationship between financial sector development measures \nand renewable energy sector development. \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 836  Taghizadeh-Hesary et al. \n \n3.

EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS \n4.1  Data \nAnalysis was conducted on the top five solar module producing countries in the world \nfrom 1997 to 2015. The five countries are the PRC, Germany, Japan, the Republic  \nof Korea, and Malaysia (Figure 6). However, due to the lack of statistics available on \nMalaysia, the analysis was conducted on the sixth solar module producing country, the \nUnited States. Annual data from 1992 to 2015 were used for the analysis of Germany, \nJapan, and the United States. Due to a lack of data, quarterly data from 2007Q4 to \n2015Q4 were used for the PRC and annual data from 1993 to 2015 were used for the \nRepublic of Korea. \nFigure 6: Share of Total Solar Module Production from 1997 to 2015 \n(%) \n \nNote: Share of total solar module production from 1997 to 2015. Created by the writer using data from IEA-PVPS \nreports from 1998 to 2016. Share is computed based on total solar module production in watts. Data on total solar \nmodule production from 1992 to 1996 are excluded because figures by country were not available. The individual \npercentages of solar module production for other IEA countries are less than 1%. \nFor  price,  we  used  the  solar  module  prices  collected  from  the  IEA-PVPS  and \nBloomberg  databases.  For  wage,  we  used  the  average  hourly  earnings  index \n(2010=100) in the manufacturing sector collected from the OECD database. As the \nindex was not available for the PRC, average wage taken from the Federal Reserve \nBank  of  Atlanta  was  used  instead.  These  data  will  be  converted  into  index  form \n(2010=100) just like wage data for other countries. For interest rate, we used the  \n10-year  government  bond  yield  rate  collected  from  the  OECD  database  and \nBloomberg. For exchange rate, we used the real effective exchange rate (2010=100) \ncollected from Bruegel (2017) and the World Bank database. For R&D expenditure, we \nused the government R&D budget data collected from IEA-PVPS and Bloomberg. It \nshould be noted that R&D expenditure data, including corporate R&D, were available. \nHowever, we used the government budget instead as the coverage of corporations is \nlimited. Quarterly data for R&D expenditure were not available for the PRC. Therefore, \nwe assumed that annual R&D expenditure was made on a quarterly basis equally and \ndivided the annual R&D expenditure by four. Knowledge stock was computed using the \nnew quarterly figures and quarterly adjusted depreciation rate. For the price of oil, we \nused the simple average of Brent crude oil prices, Dubai crude oil prices, and West \nTexas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices available from the World Bank database.  \nThe data used for solar modules, R&D expenditure, and oil prices are in nominal US \ndollars. The three series are all deflated by the US GDP deflator (2010=100). The  \n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 836  Taghizadeh-Hesary et al. \n \ndata for wage are based on national currencies. Wage and long-term interest rate  \nare deflated using the national GDP deflator (2010=100). The GDP deflators for all \ncountries were collected from the World Bank database.  \n4.2  Data Analysis \n4.2.1  Unit Root Test \nAll  series  must  be  evaluated  for  stationarities,  as  the  use  of  stationary  series  in \nregression analysis will have spurious results. We performed the augmented Dicky-\nFuller test in level to check for unit roots. Excluding interest rate, all series were tested \nin their logarithm form. The results are summarized in Table 1. For all series among \nfive countries, the null hypothesis was not rejected in level. Therefore, we had to \nconduct a unit root test on first differences of all series.

Once the test had been conducted and it was discovered \nthat  the  series  are  nonstationary  in  level  and  stationary  in  first  differences,  they  \nwere integrated of order one or I (1).

Several key findings emerged. First, the coefficients for wage ( ) gave \npositive results. However, t-statistics were not statistically significant for any of the \ncountries. This suggests that the solar module price industry is not labor-intens\ud835\udc64i\ud835\udc61ve. This \nleads to the assumption that the market competitiveness of Chinese solar module \nproducing companies was not supported by the low wage rate. Next, interest rate ( ) \nhas a statistically significant impact on solar module price for Germany, Japan, and the \nUnited States. The coefficients were 0.473, 0.501, and 0.307. A 1% increase in re\ud835\udc5fa\ud835\udc61l \ninterest  rate  results  in  a  less  than  1%  increase  in  solar  module  prices.  This  is \nconsistent  with  the  assumption  that  solar  module  industry  is  capital-intensive. \nExchange rate ( ) has a statistically significant impact on solar module prices in \nGermany, the Republic of Korea, and the United States. The coefficients were \u20136.486, \n\u20131.889, and \u20131.2\ud835\udc528\ud835\udc613. A 1% increase in the real effective exchange rate results in an \napproximately 1% price decrease in the Republic of Korea and the United States and a \n6% price decrease in Germany. This suggests that as the national currency becomes \nstronger,  the  material  import  costs  decline  and  therefore  solar  module  prices. \nFurthermore, an increase in the real effective exchange rate decreases oil prices, \nleading to a decline in solar module prices as substitute goods. Knowledge stock ( ) \nhas a statistically significant impact on solar module price for the PRC, the Republic of \nKorea, and the United States. The coefficients were \u20131.604, \u20130.312, and \u20130.907. A 1\ud835\udc34%\ud835\udc61  \nincrease in knowledge stock leads to an approximately 1% decline in solar module \nprices.  This  suggests  that  government  investment  in  solar  photovoltaic  R&D \nexpenditure has a positive effect on solar module manufacturing efficiency. Oil price \n(  has a statistically significant impact on solar module prices in the PRC, Japan, \nand the United States. The coefficients were \u20130.448, \u20130.715, and 0.418. The type of \nin\ud835\udc5df\ud835\udc5clu\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59e)nce  differs  among  countries.  The  coefficients  for  the  PRC  and  Japan  took \nnegative figures. This suggests that a rise in oil price increased future demand for \nrenewable energy, which led to an increase in investment into renewable technology, \n14 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 836  Taghizadeh-Hesary et al. \n \nthereby resulting in a price reduction in solar modules through technological advances. \nThis is consistent with the results from past researches that suggested that a decline in \noil prices led to renewable technology advances. Meanwhile, the coefficient for the \nUnited States takes a positive value. This is because the energy substitution rate \nbetween renewable energies and crude oils is high in the United States. \n5.  CONCLUSION AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS \nIn this paper, we have examined the influence of wage, interest rate, exchange rate, \nR&D expenditure, and oil price on the price of solar modules for five major solar \nmodule producing countries. As precedent works focused mainly on the supply side \nfactor of the economy, we have assumed that the consideration of potential economic \nfactors would give us new insights into the mechanism surrounding the recent cost \nreduction in solar modules. We have constructed a solar module pricing model and \nconducted a fully modified OLS (FMOLS) to estimate the influence of each factor. Our \nempirical analysis results gave several findings concerning the solar module pricing \nmechanism. Wage ( ) and interest rate  ) have a positive correlation with solar \nmodule prices ( , while exchange rate ( ), knowledge stock ( ), and oil price \nhave a negative\ud835\udc64 correlation with solar( \ud835\udc5fmodule prices ( . There are several \nsolar energy poli\ud835\udc5dc\ud835\udc60y\ud835\udc5c \ud835\udc59r\ud835\udc4ee\ud835\udc5fc)ommendations that can b\ud835\udc52e made based on thes\ud835\udc34e findings.  \n(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59)  \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f)\nFirst, government must expand channels for renewable energy funding. As renewable \nindustries are high-tech, the influence that capital cost has on technology price is \nsignificant.  Government  efforts  to  provide  industries  with  low-interest  finance  will \naccelerate renewable business. There have been many attempts to lower interest rates \nfor renewable energy technology to accelerate growth in the green technology market. \nFor example, top solar module producing countries such as Malaysia and the Republic \nof  Korea  have  started  what  is  called  green  technology  financing,  which  enables \nrenewable energy companies to loan money at a low interest rate. Similarly, there are \nreports from REN21 (2017) that state that the role of third-party financing may also \nbecome strong in the solar energy industry. In the United States, the development of \nthird-party financing has become strong and IEA-PVPS assumes that the lower capital \ncosts driven by these parties have contributed to new installations of solar systems in \nrecent years. These past attempts at lowering interest rates for renewable energy loans \nwill be effective in further reducing prices for solar modules as well as enhancing solar \nenergy installation growth. Therefore, the government must lower interest rates for \nsolar module industry to be able to finance manufacturing. \nSecond,  government  must  expand  R&D  expenditures  toward  renewable  energy \ntechnology.  The  technological  advancements  acquired  through  research  and \ndevelopment  enhance  module  performance  efficiency,  thereby  reducing  cost. \nTherefore,  government  policies  aimed  at  increasing  R&D  expenditure  will  be  an \neffective procedure for expanding the installation of renewable energies. However, the \ndifferences in environmental regulations and the objectives of R&D expenditure will \nhave different effects on solar module price. Therefore, specifying the objective of R&D \nwill be necessary to acquire the expected result of price reduction. Moreover, the \ninfluence of corporate R&D expenditure was not taken into consideration due to a lack \nof coverage in solar industry surveys. If the influence of corporate R&D expenditure on \nsolar module price is strong, the exclusion of the series will have a critical impact on \nthe analysis results. Therefore, using corporate R&D expenditure as an independent \nvariable may give us a better understanding of the role of solar R&D in reducing \ntechnology costs.   \n15 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 836  Taghizadeh-Hesary et al. \n \nREFERENCES \nArrow, K.

Thus, the price reduction mechanism in solar modules has become an important topic as the role of solar electricity in the overall energy supply and the market value of solar modules grow globally. Many empirical analyses have been carried out to unveil the mechanism behind this price reduction. However, the research performed on the price reduction mechanism of solar modules over the years have focused purely on the technological aspect of the manufacturing. When analyzing price, the influence of economic factors such as interest rate and exchange rate must also be taken into consideration to achieve a precise analysis. We use an oligopolistic model and econometric method to determine the economic factors that have an influence on solar module prices.", "Title": "Empirical Analysis of Factors Influencing Price of Solar Modules"}}
