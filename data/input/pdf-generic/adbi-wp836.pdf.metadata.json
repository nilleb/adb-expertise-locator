INTRODUCTION \n\nTaghizadeh-Hesary et al. \n\nGovernment and private sector incentives to invest in renewable energy have grown as \na  way  of  reducing  fossil  fuel  dependency  and  environmental  damage.  Due  to  these \nnew investments, the renewable energy field has seen vast growth in recent years. In \nthe  field  of  solar  electricity  in  particular,  the  annual  solar  PV  electricity  production \nincreased  from  4  TWh  in  2005  to  247  TWh  in  2015  (IEA  2017).  Moreover,  the \naccumulated solar electricity plant capacity grew from 100,504 MW in 2012 to 368,000 \nMW in 2017 (Figure 1). One of the factors supporting this growth in the solar electricity \nsector is the reduction in the cost of solar modules.  \n\nFigure 1: Worldwide Growth in Cumulative Capacity of Solar Photovoltaics  \nfrom 1992 to 2017 \n\n \nNote: Cumulative capacity of solar photovoltaics from 1992 to 2017 in MW. Created by writer using data collected from \nthe Global Market Outlook for Solar Power 2016\u20132020, 2015\u20132019, 2014\u20132018 and Snapshot of Global PV 1992\u20132014.  \n\nKimura and Zissler (2016) have carried out a comparison of solar PV prices in Japan \nand Germany. Their study analyzed solar PV system costs. Their comparison of solar \nPV  cost  (50  kW  or  more  and  less  than  500  kW)  in  2015  showed  that  module  cost \nmakes  up  about  30%  to  40%  of  the  system  price  in  Japan  and  50%  in  Germany. \nTherefore, the price of solar modules plays a large part in solar system prices. As can \nbe  seen  in  Figure  2,  the  price  of  solar  modules  has  seen  a  huge  drop  worldwide  in \nrecent  years.  The  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  which  dominates  the  solar \nmodule market today, saw a reduction from $5,810/kW in 2007 to $570/kW in 2015 and \nless  than  $350/kW  in  2017.  However,  a  global  comparison  shows  that  there  are \ndifferences  in  the  speed  of  cost  reduction.  For  example,  Japan  saw  a  drop  from \n$3,700/kW in 2007 to $1,140/kW in 2015. Here, the module price in Japan was initially \ncheaper than that in the PRC. However, in 2015, the module price in Japan was twice \nthat of the PRC. To encourage the installation of solar electricity, analyzing the factors \ninfluencing the price reduction in solar photovoltaic modules is crucial. Although many \nresearches  have  been  carried  out  analyzing  the  price  of  solar  modules,  all  have \nfocused  on  the  supply  factor,  especially  the  technological  factors  of  the  solar \nphotovoltaic  market  price.  Therefore,  in  this  paper,  we  will  consider  the  economic \nfactors  of  the  solar  module  market  with  a  view  to  accurately  identifying  the  factors \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 836 \n \n\nTaghizadeh-Hesary et al. \n\nbehind price changes in solar modules. Section 2 discusses past researches related to \npotential factors influencing the solar module price reduction mechanism. The potential \nfactors  include  learning  by  doing,  R&D  expenditure,  oil  price,  and  exchange  rate. \nSection  3  will  clarify  the  process  of  creating  our  solar  module  pricing  model,  which \nincludes  wage,  interest  rate,  exchange  rate,  R&D  expenditure,  and  oil  price  as \nexplanatory variables, and module price as the independent variable. We will assume \nan oligopolistic market. Section 4 presents data analysis. Taking into consideration the \nresults  of  the  data  analysis,  fully  modified  OLS  (FMOLS)  will  be  conducted  for \nregression.  This  will  be  followed  by  the  empirical  results  on  the  relationship  between \nsolar module price, wage, interest rate, exchange rate, R&D expenditure, and oil price. \nSection  5  presents  a  conclusion  and  policy  implications.  We  will  conclude  that \ngovernment efforts to increase financing channels and R&D expenditures toward solar \nphotovoltaics will be needed to accelerate solar system installation. \n\n2.  LITERATURE SURVEY \n\n2.1  Overview of Solar Module Price \n\nThe solar module price changes in the five countries of the PRC, Germany, Japan, the \nRepublic  of  Korea,  and  the  United  States  are  summarized  in  Figure  2.  Overall,  from \n1992  to  2015,  solar  module  prices  decreased  due  to  technological  advances.  By  the \nearly  2000s,  the  solar  module  price  for  the  four  countries  of  Germany,  Japan,  the \nRepublic  of  Korea,  and  the  United  States  had  decreased  to  approximately  50%\u201370% \nsince 1992. However, these four countries saw sudden increases in solar module price \nfrom 2004. This can be explained by the increase in crude oil prices.1 Figure 3 shows \nthat  crude  oil  prices  started  to  rise in  the  early  2000s.  With  the  increase  in  oil  prices, \nthe  demand  for  alternative  energy  increased,  and  thus  the  price  of  solar  modules. \nMoreover,  in  2004,  Germany  saw  a  relatively  sudden  increase  in  solar  module  price \nfrom  $3.7  per  watt  in  2004  to  $7.4  per  watt  in  2005.  This  can  be  explained  by  the \nrevision  of  the  feed-in  tariff  (FIT)  policy.  In  2004,  Germany  passed  the  German \nRenewable  Energy  Sources  Act  (EEG)  2004,  which  increased  photovoltaic  FIT  price \nsetting  and  made  the  policy  applicable  to  solar  PV  systems  larger  than  1,000  MW \n(Ministry of the Environment 2015). This rise in solar FIT price setting and policy target \nexpansion increased electricity suppliers\u2019 demand for renewable electricity equipment, \nresulting in the growth of annual solar PV installation from 0.14 GW in 2003 to 0.67 GW \nin  2004  (Figure  3).  This  increase  in  demand  may  account  for  the  sudden  increase  in \nsolar  module  price  in  Germany.  Solar  modules  reverted  to  the  declining  trend  from \n2008 with solar module prices dropping to $3.5 per watt in 2009. This can be explained \nby  another  revision  of  the  FIT  in  2009  with  the  passing  of  EEG  2009.  EEG  2009 \nannounced that the FIT price degression rate would be increased and the price setting \nwould  be  determined  based  on  the  annual  solar  PV  installment  in  the  previous  year. \nThis reduced the incentive for electricity suppliers to expand solar PV systems, thereby \nreducing  both  the  demand  for,  and  price  of,  solar  modules.  Japan  introduced  its  FIT \npolicy  in  2012.  This  led  to  an  increase  in  solar  module  installation  from  2013.  The \nannual solar PV installation more than quadrupled from 1.718 GW in 2012 to 6.967 GW \nin 2013. However, unlike in Germany under EEG 2004, the price of solar modules has \ncontinued  to  decrease  in  Japan  since  the  introduction  of  the  feed-in  tariff.  There  are \nseveral  possible  explanations  for  this.  First,  the  average  price  of  crude  oil  started  to \ndecrease  from  2012.  In  response,  solar  module  prices  have  decreased  due  to  the \n                                                 \n1   For more information on the reasons behind the oil price increases in the 2000s see Taghizadeh-Hesary \n\nand Yoshino (2014) and Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary (2014; 2015; 2016). \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 836 \n \n\nTaghizadeh-Hesary et al. \n\nenergy substitution relationship between renewable energy and oil. Another reason is \nthe difference in FIT policy management. The FIT policy in Japan is based on that of \nEuropean  countries  such  as  Germany.  With  the  precedent  of  Germany,  it  was  not \ndifficult  to  see  that  FIT  overpricing  led  to  excessive  demand  in  solar  modules  and \nincreases in both solar module prices and electricity prices. Therefore, the FIT levy for \nsolar  PV  in  Japan  was  set  at  0.22  yen/kWh,  lower  than  the  levy  under  EGG  2004  of \n0.51  eurocent/kWh  (REI  2017).  Therefore,  the  influence  of  FIT  on  solar  module \ndemand was smaller in Japan than in Germany.  \n\nFigure 2: Price Change in Solar Modules for the Top Five Producing Countries \nfrom 1992 to 2015 \n\n \nNote:  Price  of  solar  modules  for  top  six  solar  module  producing  countries  in  watts.

The  learning \ncurve  effect  is  a  trend  in  manufacturing  where  the  manufacturing  process  becomes \nmore  efficient  as  it  produces  more  units  Arrow  (1962).  Wright  (1936)  refers  to  this  \ntrend as the learning-by-doing effect. Neij, Anderson, and Durstewitz (1997) performed  \ncase  studies  on  wind  power  and  concluded  that  experience  curves  are  applicable  \nto  energy  conversion  technologies  such  as  solar  PV.  Many  past  researchers  have \ncreated  multiple  models  revolving  around  the  learning  curve  to  analyze  solar  module \ncosts  for  the  benefit  of  solar  photovoltaic  development.  Messener  (1998)  created  a \nlearning  curve  model  applicable  to  energy  systems.  Messener\u2019s  model  was  created  \nto  analyze  the  influence  of  technological  change.  This  model  became  the  basis  of \nlearning  curves  in  energy  technology  and  was  later  extended  to  what  is  called  the  \nERIS  (Energy  Research  and  Investment  Strategy)  model  (Barreto  et  al.  2000).  Pillai \n(2015)  created  a  cost  reduction  model  including  cumulative  capacity,  plant  size, \npolysilicon  price,  polysilicon  usage,  firm  efficiency,  PRC  dummy,  and  investment  as \nexplanatory variables.  \n\nSome  research  has  focused  on  the  mechanism  of  the  learning-by-doing  effect.  Bahk \nand  Gort  (1993)  categorized  learning  by  doing  into  three  categories  of  labor,  capital, \nand  organization  to  explain  the  mechanism  of  learning  by  doing.  Nemet  (2005)  came \nup with a solar module pricing model including various variables representing different \nlearning-by-doing effect channels to pinpoint which processes of manufacturing show a \nlearning-by-doing effect. McDonald and Schrattenholzer (2000) estimated the learning \nrates for various energy conversion technologies including solar photovoltaic modules \nusing energy technology models. \n\nAs  Glachant,  Meniere,  and  Arnaud  (2013)  state  in  their  paper,  the  experience  curve \neffect plays a huge part in both the government\u2019s renewable energy policy discussions \nand solar PV manufacturing. However, there are researches questioning the validity of \nusing  learning  by  doing  in  empirical  analysis.  Nemet  (2005)  tackled  the  fundamental \nassumption that the learning-by-doing effect has a critical impact on the solar module \ncost reduction process. He used six cost reduction factors, i.e. module efficiency, plant \nsize, yield, polycrystalline share, silicon consumption, and wafer size, to create a model \nof photovoltaic module price reduction. He concluded that learning by doing accounts \nfor  less  than  10%  of  overall  cost  reduction.  He  went  on  to  say  that  to  make  realistic \ndecisions in the solar photovoltaic industry, knowledge spillovers and market dynamics \nmust  be  considered.  Similarly,  Sallenave  (1985)  states  in  his  paper  that  although \nlearning  curves  can  be  useful  for  companies  in  competitive  analysis,  the  learning \ncurves do not serve as a reliable cost forecasting system because it is subject to many \nconstraints. Schaeffer et al. (2004) state that the learning curve must be used with care \nas there are many data uncertainties in the energy sector.  \n\nThe set of researches focusing on the technological aspect of price reduction has been \nthe center of various renewable energy policies. However, the fundamental assumption \nthat  learning  by  doing  should  be  included  in  energy  technology  prices  may  need  to  \nbe  reconsidered  as  production  itself  is  a  function  of  many  different  variables.  As  was \nmentioned in Nemet (2005), consideration of market dynamics may give new insights \ninto the price reduction process. Taking this into account, this paper will add economic \nperspectives  to  the  analysis  of  solar  photovoltaic  module  price.  In  other  words,  the \nexplanatory  variables  used  in  this  paper  will  break  down  production  into  a  function  of \nseveral  economic  factors  and  market  dynamics  will  be  considered  in  the  process  of \nmodel production. \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 836 \n \n\nTaghizadeh-Hesary et al. \n\n2.3  R&D Expenditure in the Solar Industry  \n\nR&D expenditure in the solar energy sector has been growing globally. The global solar \nR&D  expenditure  in  2016  totaled  3.6  billion  dollars  (Bloomberg  2017).  To  expand  the \ninstallation of solar energy technologies, both the public sector and corporations have \nbeen  increasing  investment  in  solar  R&D.  Under  this  trend,  the  influence  of  R&D \nexpenditure on technology price reduction has been an important topic. In solar module \nprice researches, the effect of R&D expenditure has been taken into consideration as \nan extension of learning-by-doing effect models to better understand the mechanism of \ncost  reduction.  There  have  been  multiple  solar  module  pricing  models  with  R&D \nexpenditure  as  explanatory  variable  that  are  an  extension  of  the  ERIS  model  (Miketa \nand Schrattenholzer 2004; Barreto and Kypreos 2004). Glachant, Meniere, and Arnaud \n(2013)  created  an  experience  curve  model  using  cumulative  production,  R&D \nknowledge stock, and input price to predict module prices in 2020. Among the studies \nof  renewable  energy  R&D,  there  are  also  researches  that  focus  on  different  types  \nof  R&D  in  price  analysis.  Youah  (2013)  used  different  types  of  data  set  for  R&D \nexpenditures to see which best fits the learning curve model. Youah compared the use \nof R&D expenditure by itself and the accumulation of R&D expenditure as explanatory \nvariables to see which fits the trend in solar module price reduction better. The results \nshowed  that  accumulation  of  R&D  expenditure  was  superior  in  identifying  the  price \nmechanism  of  solar  modules.  Hayamizu,  Furubayashi,  and  Nakata  (2014)  compared \nthe  difference  between  the  effect  of  public  solar  R&D  expenditure  and  corporate  \nsolar  R&D  expenditure  in  Japan  and  concluded  that  the  influence  of  corporate  solar \nR&D  expenditure  on  solar  module  price  is  stronger  than  that  of  public  solar  R&D \nexpenditure.  Although  it  is  commonly  assumed  that  R&D  expenditure  results  in  cost \nreduction, recent research points out that R&D expenditure has limitations as a variable \nfor  price  determination.  Shimamoto,  Ueta,  and  Kokubu  (2017)  performed  an  analysis \non  the  use  of  R&D  expenditure  in  econometric  analysis.  R&D  expenditure  does  not \nalways  show  results,  therefore  the  use  of  R&D  expenditure  as  a  variable  to  explain \ntechnological advances may give misleading results. In this case the use of patents as \na  variable  may  be  an  option  as  patents  are  direct  results  of  R&D.  Patents,  however, \nhave  specific  purposes  and  converting  them  into  a  figure  that  considers  the  value  of \neach  patent  in  terms  of  the  level  of  technological  advances  is  still  difficult.  They  also \npoint out that the objective of R&D expenditure varies and thus the influence of R&D on \ntechnology price may be hard to identify just as patents. For example, in a country with \nstronger  environmental  regulations,  R&D  expenditure  may  not  result  in  an  increased \nrenewable  energy  technology  price.  Rather,  expenditure  on  quality  enhancement  \nmay  increase  the  price  of  renewable  energy  technology.  Taking  this  into  account, \ntechnological  advancement  does  not  always  lead  to  price  reduction  or  the  market \nsuperiority that comes with it.  \n\n2.4  Relationship between Oil Prices and Renewable Energy \n\nRenewable energy was developed as a substitute for oil. The transition from oil-based \nenergy  to  renewable  energy  was  backed  up  by  an  increase  in  oil  price  and  a  global \ntrend  toward  a  sustainable  society.  Figure  4  summarizes  the  oil  price  changes  from \n1990 to 2015. Ever since 2002, the world has seen sudden increases in oil prices. As \noil  prices  have  increased,  the  demand  for  alternative  energy  has  also  increased. \nTherefore,  in  renewable  price  analysis,  the  influence  of  oil  prices  cannot  be  ignored, \nwhich is the so-called \u201cprimary\u201d or \u201csubstitution effect.\u201d There is also a secondary effect \nof oil on the price of PV. Oil or energy is considered a production input alongside labor \nand  capital.  When  the  price  of  oil  or  energy  rises,  the  production  cost  will  increase, \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 836 \n \n\nTaghizadeh-Hesary et al. \n\nwhich  pushes  the  price  of  PV  upward.2 An  empirical  study  by  Brunnschweiler  (2009) \nbacks this up. The results show that an increase in oil price has a positive influence on \nrenewable  energy  consumption.  Papandreou  and  Ruzzenenti  (2015)  performed  an \nanalysis of the influence that fossil fuel price has on low carbon energy systems. Their \ndiscussion suggests that maintaining oil price played a role in smoothing the transition \nto a sustainable energy system. Cheon and Urpelainen (2012) carried out an empirical \nanalysis on the influence oil price has on technological advances in renewable energy. \nThe analysis shows that an increase in oil prices results in the increase of factors such \nas  public  renewable  R&D  expenditure  and  renewable  patents.  Similar  results  can  be \nfound from a work by Wong, Chia, and Chang. (2013). They conducted an analysis on \nthe  elasticity  of  energy  R&D  in  relation  to  changes  in  oil  prices.  Their  results  showed \nthat  oil  price  has  positive  correlations  to  renewable  R&D.  Therefore,  increases  in  oil \nprices  may  accelerate  technological  advances.  As  noted  in  Section  2.2,  increases  in \nR&D  are  commonly  known  to  lower  prices  of  renewable  technologies.  Therefore,  an \nincrease in oil price will increase R&D expenditure and in turn lower the price of solar \nmodules.  However,  the  impact  that  lower  oil  prices  have  on  renewable  energy \ntechnologies  depends  on  the  scale  and  location  of  the  project  (Terrado,  Mendis,  and \nFitzgerald 1988). \n\nFigure 4: Daily Change in Crude Oil Price from 2 January 2005  \nto 30 December 2017 \n\n \nNote: WTI crude oil price is West Texas Intermediate, Cushing, Oklahoma Spot Price, Free on Board (US$ per barrel). \nBrent  crude  oil  price  is  Europe  Brent  Spot  Price  FOB  (Dollars  per  Barrel).

First,  through  the  importation  of \nsolar  module  materials,  the  manufacturing  cost  of  solar  modules  is  influenced  by  the \nexchange  rate.  The  raw  material  of  a  solar  module  is  polysilicon.  Polysilicon  is  first \nprocessed  into  silicon  ingots,  which  are  then  sliced  into  silicon  wafers.  These  silicon \nwafers  are  integrated  into  solar  cells,  which  function  as  the  fundamental  energy \nconversion  units.  Finally,  the  solar  cells  are  put  together  into  solar  modules.  In  the \nprocess of manufacturing solar modules, there are two main international transactions \nto be noted, i.e. the importation of solar cells and silicon (Figure 5). There have been \nprecedent  works  on  the  influence  of  the  material  cost  on  solar  module  prices.  Nemet \n(2005)  used  a  model  with  polysilicon  as  an  independent  variable  and  solar  module \nprice  as  the  dependent  variable.  The  results  showed  that  silicon  cost  explains  about \n12%  of  the  learning-by-doing  effect.  Similarly,  an  empirical  analysis  by  Pillai  (2014) \nshowed that a 1% drop in silicon price accounts for a 0.9% drop in solar module prices. \nTherefore,  both  the  price  of  materials  and  the  strength  of  each  country\u2019s  national \ncurrency,  which  influences  the  material  import  costs,  have  an  influence  on  solar \nmodule  price.  The  second  channel  is  through  the  changes  in  oil  import  prices.  The \ntechnological  advancement  in  renewable  energy  has  been  backed  up  by  the  price \nincrease in crude oil and the global trend toward a sustainable society. Therefore, the \nexchange rate will also influence solar modules indirectly by influencing oil price. \n\nFigure 5: Solar Module Manufacturing Process \n\nNote: Manufacturing process of solar modules from raw material of polysilicon to solar photovoltaic modules. \n\n \n\n2.6  Overview of Renewable Energy Loans \n\nThe renewable energy industry is considered high-tech and capital-intensive as it takes \ntime  to  recoup  investment.  The  influence  of  interest  rate  on  renewable  technology \ndevelopment has been discussed in past researches. A discussion note by the Council \non  Economic  Policies  (CEP)  analyzes  the  influence  of  low  interest  on  renewable \nenergy technology (Monnin 2015). Monnin states that long-term interest rates play an \nimportant role in energy investments. His analysis showed that the impact of changes \nin  interest  rate  is  stronger  on  green  energy  technology  costs  than  on  brown  energy \ncosts.  Therefore,  the  interest  rate  not  only  influences  renewable  energy  technology \ncost but the relative competitiveness between green and brown technology. Similarly, \nresearch by Brunnschweiler (2009) shows that development in the financing sector has \na significant impact on renewable technology development. The research included an \nempirical analysis on the relationship between financial sector development measures \nand renewable energy sector development. \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 836 \n \n\nTaghizadeh-Hesary et al. \n\n3.  THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK \n\n3.1  Solar Module Pricing Model \n\nWe  constructed  a  solar  module  pricing  model  using  the  following  procedure.

Here,  the  import  price  of  oil  is \n(\ud835\udc512)\nconsidered  because  renewable  energy  technology  functions  as  a  substitute  for  oil \nresources.

They computed that \nthe  mean  knowledge  stock  annual depreciation  rate  in  the  Japanese  solar  industry  is \napproximately  30%.  Following  this  result,  the  basic  depreciation  rate  is  set  at  30%  in \nthe analysis. \n\n\u03b4\n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 836 \n \n\nTaghizadeh-Hesary et al. \n\n4.  EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS \n\n4.1  Data \n\nAnalysis was conducted on the top five solar module producing countries in the world \nfrom  1997  to  2015.  The  five  countries  are  the  PRC,  Germany,  Japan,  the  Republic  \nof  Korea,  and  Malaysia  (Figure  6). However,  due  to  the lack  of  statistics  available  on \nMalaysia, the analysis was conducted on the sixth solar module producing country, the \nUnited States. Annual data from 1992 to 2015 were used for the analysis of Germany, \nJapan,  and  the  United  States.  Due  to  a  lack  of  data,  quarterly  data  from  2007Q4  to \n2015Q4 were used for the PRC and annual data from 1993 to 2015 were used for the \nRepublic of Korea. \n\nFigure 6: Share of Total Solar Module Production from 1997 to 2015 \n(%) \n\nNote:  Share  of  total  solar  module  production  from  1997  to  2015.  Created  by  the  writer  using  data  from  IEA-PVPS \nreports  from  1998  to  2016.  Share  is  computed  based  on  total  solar  module  production  in  watts.  Data  on  total  solar \nmodule  production  from  1992  to  1996  are  excluded  because  figures  by  country  were  not  available.  The  individual \npercentages of solar module production for other IEA countries are less than 1%. \n\n \n\nFor  price,  we  used  the  solar  module  prices  collected  from  the  IEA-PVPS  and \nBloomberg  databases.  For  wage,  we  used  the  average  hourly  earnings  index \n(2010=100)  in  the  manufacturing  sector  collected  from  the  OECD  database.  As  the \nindex  was  not  available  for  the  PRC,  average  wage  taken  from  the  Federal  Reserve \nBank  of  Atlanta  was  used  instead.  These  data  will  be  converted  into  index  form \n(2010=100)  just  like  wage  data  for  other  countries.  For  interest  rate,  we  used  the  \n10-year  government  bond  yield  rate  collected  from  the  OECD  database  and \nBloomberg.  For  exchange  rate,  we  used  the  real  effective  exchange  rate  (2010=100) \ncollected from Bruegel (2017) and the World Bank database. For R&D expenditure, we \nused  the  government  R&D  budget  data  collected  from  IEA-PVPS  and  Bloomberg.  It \nshould be noted that R&D expenditure data, including corporate R&D, were available. \nHowever, we used the government budget instead as the coverage of corporations is \nlimited. Quarterly data for R&D expenditure were not available for the PRC. Therefore, \nwe assumed that annual R&D expenditure was made on a quarterly basis equally and \ndivided the annual R&D expenditure by four. Knowledge stock was computed using the \nnew quarterly figures and quarterly adjusted depreciation rate. For the price of oil, we \nused  the  simple  average  of  Brent  crude  oil  prices,  Dubai  crude  oil  prices,  and  West \nTexas  Intermediate  (WTI)  crude  oil  prices  available  from  the  World  Bank  database.  \nThe  data  used  for  solar  modules,  R&D  expenditure,  and  oil  prices  are  in  nominal  US \ndollars.  The  three  series  are  all  deflated  by  the  US  GDP  deflator  (2010=100).  The  \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 836 \n \n\nTaghizadeh-Hesary et al. \n\ndata  for  wage  are  based  on  national  currencies.  Wage  and  long-term  interest  rate  \nare  deflated  using  the  national  GDP  deflator  (2010=100).  The  GDP  deflators  for  all \ncountries were collected from the World Bank database.  \n\n4.2  Data Analysis \n\n4.2.1  Unit Root Test \n\nAll  series  must  be  evaluated  for  stationarities,  as  the  use  of  stationary  series  in \nregression  analysis  will  have  spurious  results.  We  performed  the  augmented  Dicky-\nFuller test in level to check for unit roots. Excluding interest rate, all series were tested \nin  their  logarithm  form.  The  results  are  summarized  in  Table  1.  For  all  series  among \nfive  countries,  the  null  hypothesis  was  not  rejected  in  level.  Therefore,  we  had  to \nconduct a unit root test on first differences of all series. The results showed that the null \nhypothesis  was  rejected  in  the  first  difference.  This  means  that  all  series  have  unit \nroots in the first differences. Once the test had been conducted and it was discovered \nthat  the  series  are  nonstationary  in  level  and  stationary  in  first  differences,  they  \nwere integrated of order one or I (1). Therefore, all series were integrated of order one. \nSince all the series share the same order of integration, a cointegration test had to be \nconducted between all series.  \n\nTable 1: Unit Root Test (Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test) \n\n \n \nVariable \n\nAugmented Dickey-Fuller Test (ADF) \n\nLevels \n\nFirst Differences \n\n \n \nCountry \n\nGermany \n \n \n \n \nJapan \n \n \n \n \nKorea, Rep. of \n \n \n \n \nPRC \n\n \n \n \nUS \n \n \n \n \nWorld \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nw \npsolar\nr \ne \nA \n\nw \npsolar\nr \ne \nA \n\nw \npsolar\nr \ne \nA \n\nW \npsolar\nR \nE \nA \n\nw \npsolar\nr \ne \nA \n\npoil\npoil\n\nt-statistics \n\u20134.697** \n\u20133.952** \n\u20135.645** \n\u20133.774** \n\u20134.653** \n\u20133.339* \n\u20134.031** \n\u20133.964** \n\u20133.485* \n\u20133.068** \n\u20134.283** \n\u20134.867** \n\u20137.310** \n\u20134.923** \n\u20135.289** \n\u20133.651** \n\u20134.048** \n\u20134.139** \n\u20134.507** \n\u20134.151** \n\u20134.549** \n\u20133.375* \n\u20135.949** \n\u20133.434* \n\u20133.805** \n\u20134.147** \n\u20134.292** \n\np-value \n0.001** \n0.007** \n0.000** \n0.010** \n0.002** \n0.025* \n0.006** \n0.007** \n0.019* \n0.046** \n0.004** \n0.001** \n0.000** \n0.001** \n0.000** \n0.010** \n0.005** \n0.004** \n0.001** \n0.003** \n0.002** \n0.024* \n0.000** \n0.020* \n0.009** \n0.004** \n0.002** \n\nt-statistics \n\u20130.011 \n\u20132.126 \n0.544 \n\u20131.897 \n\u20132.252 \n1.375 \n\u20131.396 \n0.179 \n\u20131.802 \n\u20132.600 \n0.127 \n\u20131.219 \n\u20132.936 \n\u20130.274 \n\u20130.278 \n\u20131.623 \n\u20130.481 \n\u20130.610 \n\u20130.155 \n\u20130.499 \n0.773 \n\u20131.827 \n\u20131.221 \n\u20132.771 \n\u20131.363 \n\u20131.219 \n\u20130.982 \n\np-value \n0.948 \n0.237 \n0.984 \n0.328 \n0.195 \n0.998 \n0.566 \n0.965 \n0.370 \n0.110 \n0.960 \n0.648 \n0.057 \n0.915 \n0.915 \n0.459 \n0.879 \n0.851 \n0.934 \n0.877 \n0.991 \n0.358 \n0.647 \n0.080 \n0.582 \n0.649 \n0.748 \n\n12 \n \n\n \n (quarterly) \n\nNote: *denotes significance at the 5% level and ** denotes significance at the 1% level. \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 836 \n \n\n4.2.2  Cointegration Test \n\nTaghizadeh-Hesary et al. \n\nTo  identify  the  cointegrating  vectors  among  the  five  series,  i.e.  price,  interest  rate, \nexchange  rate,  wage,  and  knowledge  stock,  we  conducted  a  cointegration  analysis \nusing the Johansen test. Again, the test was conducted on their logarithm form except \nfor  interest  rate.  The  results  are  summarized  in  Table  2  and  show  that  the  null \nhypothesis  was  rejected.  This  means  that  all  series  for  each  country  have  at  least  \none  cointegrating  equation.  In  other  words,  all  series  are  cointegrated  and  there  \nis  a  long-run  association  among  price  (in  logarithm),  interest  rate,  exchange  rate  \n(in logarithm), wage (in logarithm), and knowledge stock (in logarithm). When there are \ncointegrations,  an  error  correction  model  should  be  used  for  the  regression  analysis. \nAs  all  the  variables  for  this  research  are  I(1),  we  consider  the  fully  modified  OLS \nintroduced  by  Phillips  and  Hansen  (1990).  This  model  allows  us  to  provide  optimal \nestimates of cointegrating regressions. \n\nTable 2: Cointegration Test \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTrace \n\nMaximum Eigenvalue \n\nCountry \n\nGermany \n \n \n \n \n \nJapan \n \n \n \n \n \nKorea, Rep. of \n \n \n \n \n \nPRC \n \n \n \n \n \nUS \n \n \n \n \n \n\nHypothesized \nNo. of CE(s) \nr=0 \nr<=1 \nr<=2 \nr<=3 \nr<=4 \nr<=5 \nr=0 \nr<=1 \nr<=2 \nr<=3 \nr<=4 \nr<=5 \nr=0 \nr<=1 \nr<=2 \nr<=3 \nr<=4 \nr<=5 \nr=0 \nr<=1 \nr<=2 \nr<=3 \nr<=4 \nr<=5 \nr=0 \nr<=1 \nr<=2 \nr<=3 \nr<=4 \nr<=5 \n\nEigenvalue \n0.879 \n0.816 \n0.719 \n0.456 \n0.277 \n0.089 \n0.929 \n0.810 \n0.768 \n0.378 \n0.281 \n0.020 \n0.991 \n0.898 \n0.721 \n0.530 \n0.330 \n0.166 \n0.846 \n0.735 \n0.454 \n0.301 \n0.262 \n0.123 \n0.981 \n0.923 \n0.802 \n0.707 \n0.488 \n0.304 \n\nTrace \nStatistic \n134.253 \n87.714 \n50.474 \n22.557 \n9.183 \n2.044 \n144.866 \n86.782 \n50.245 \n18.137 \n7.703 \n0.452 \n191.722 \n97.866 \n52.283 \n26.743 \n11.644 \n3.633 \n142.611 \n84.568 \n43.354 \n24.610 \n13.501 \n4.080 \n229.564 \n141.909 \n85.382 \n49.721 \n22.704 \n7.982 \n\nProb. \n0.000** \n0.001** \n0.028* \n0.269 \n0.349 \n0.153 \n0.000** \n0.001** \n0.029* \n0.556 \n0.498 \n0.502 \n0.000** \n0.000** \n0.018* \n0.108 \n0.175 \n0.057 \n0.000** \n0.002** \n0.124 \n0.176 \n0.098 \n0.043 \n0.000** \n0.000** \n0.000** \n0.000** \n0.004** \n0.005** \n\nMax-Eigen \nStatistic \n46.539 \n37.240 \n27.917 \n13.374 \n7.139 \n2.044 \n58.084 \n36.537 \n32.108 \n10.434 \n7.251 \n0.452 \n93.856 \n45.583 \n25.539 \n15.099 \n8.011 \n3.633 \n58.043 \n41.214 \n18.744 \n11.109 \n9.421 \n4.080 \n87.655 \n56.528 \n35.660 \n27.017 \n14.722 \n7.982 \n\nProb. \n0.008** \n0.019* \n0.045* \n0.418 \n0.473 \n0.153 \n0.000** \n0.024* \n0.012* \n0.703 \n0.460 \n0.502 \n0.000** \n0.001** \n0.089 \n0.282 \n0.378 \n0.057 \n0.000** \n0.006** \n0.435 \n0.636 \n0.253 \n0.043 \n0.000** \n0.000** \n0.004** \n0.007** \n0.042* \n0.005** \n\nNote: *denotes significance at the 5% level and ** denotes significance at the 1% level. \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 836 \n \n\nTaghizadeh-Hesary et al. \n\nCountry \nGermany \n(n=23) \n \n \n \n \n \nJapan \n(n=23) \n \n \n \n \n \nKorea, \nRep. of \n(n=22) \n\nTable 3: Empirical Results  \n\n \n\nVariable \nw \nr \ne \nA \n\nC.E. \n3.836 \n0.473 \n\u20136.486 \n\u20132.396 \n\u20130.055 \n26.689 \nConstant \npoil\nAdjusted R squared: \n1.938 \nw \n0.501 \nr \n\u20131.319 \ne \n0.122 \nA \n\u20130.715 \n\u20130.438 \nConstant \npoil\nAdjusted R squared: \n0.922 \nw \n0.012 \nr \n\u20131.889 \ne \n\u20130.312 \nA \n\u20130.038 \n15.111 \nConstant \npoil\nAdjusted R squared: \n\n \n\n \n\nS.E. \n6.818 \n0.138 \n2.459 \n1.840 \n0.418 \n18.783 \n\n1.722 \n0.071 \n0.879 \n0.212 \n0.186 \n10.766 \n\n0.409 \n0.020 \n0.466 \n0.051 \n0.173 \n2.060 \n\nt-statistic \n0.563 \n3.429** \n\u20132.638* \n\u20131.303 \n\u20130.131 \n1.421 \n0.745 \n1.126 \n7.042** \n\n\u20131.501 \n0.576 \n\u20133.846** \n\u20130.041 \n0.875 \n1.524 \n0.615 \n\u20134.054** \n\u20136.147** \n\u20130.219 \n\n7.334** \n0.973 \n\nCountry \nPRC \n(n=32) \n \n \n \n \n \nUS \n(n=23) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nVariable \nw \nr \ne \nA \n\nC.E. \n0.336 \n0.019 \n\u20132.538 \n\u20131.604 \n\u20130.448 \n24.247 \nConstant \npoil\nAdjusted R squared: \n2.565 \nw \nr \n0.307 \n\u20131.283 \ne \n\u20130.907 \nA \n0.418 \n\u20131.222 \nConstant \npoil\nAdjusted R squared: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nS.E. \n1.579 \n0.028 \n1,534 \n0.359 \n0.180 \n3.673 \n\n1.631 \n0.063 \n0.518 \n0.100 \n0.162 \n8.109 \n\nt-statistic \n0.213 \n0.661 \n\u20131.654 \n\u20134.464** \n\u2018\u20132.487* \n\u20186.602** \n0.958 \n1.573 \n4.7882** \n\n\u20132.476* \n\u20139.076** \n2.577* \n\u20130.151 \n0.900 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nNote: *denotes significance at the 5% level and ** denotes significance at the 1% level.  \n\n4.3  Regression Results \n\n\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61\n\n\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61\n\n\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc61\n\nThe  results  for  fully  modified  ordinary  least  squares  (FMOLS)  are  summarized  in  \nTable  3.  Several  key  findings  emerged.  First,  the  coefficients  for  wage  (\n)  gave \npositive  results.  However,  t-statistics  were  not  statistically  significant  for  any  of  the \ncountries. This suggests that the solar module price industry is not labor-intensive. This \nleads  to  the  assumption  that  the  market  competitiveness  of  Chinese  solar  module \nproducing companies was not supported by the low wage rate. Next, interest rate (\n) \nhas a statistically significant impact on solar module price for Germany, Japan, and the \nUnited  States.  The  coefficients  were  0.473,  0.501,  and  0.307.  A  1%  increase  in  real \ninterest  rate  results  in  a  less  than  1%  increase  in  solar  module  prices.  This  is \nconsistent  with  the  assumption  that  solar  module  industry  is  capital-intensive. \nExchange  rate  (\n)  has  a  statistically  significant  impact  on  solar  module  prices  in \nGermany, the Republic of Korea, and the United States. The coefficients were \u20136.486, \n\u20131.889,  and  \u20131.283.  A  1%  increase  in  the  real  effective  exchange  rate  results  in  an \napproximately 1% price decrease in the Republic of Korea and the United States and a \n6% price decrease in Germany. This suggests that as the national currency becomes \nstronger,  the  material  import  costs  decline  and  therefore  solar  module  prices. \nFurthermore,  an  increase  in  the  real  effective  exchange  rate  decreases  oil  prices, \nleading to a decline in solar module prices as substitute goods. Knowledge stock (\n) \nhas a statistically significant impact on solar module price for the PRC, the Republic of \nKorea, and the United States. The coefficients were \u20131.604, \u20130.312, and \u20130.907. A 1% \nincrease  in  knowledge  stock  leads  to  an  approximately  1%  decline  in  solar  module \nin  solar  photovoltaic  R&D \nprices.  This  suggests \nexpenditure  has  a  positive  effect  on  solar  module  manufacturing  efficiency.  Oil  price \n(\n has  a  statistically  significant  impact  on  solar  module  prices  in  the  PRC,  Japan, \nand  the  United  States.  The  coefficients  were  \u20130.448,  \u20130.715,  and  0.418.  The  type  of \n\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59)\ninfluence  differs  among  countries.  The  coefficients  for  the  PRC  and  Japan  took \nnegative  figures.  This  suggests  that  a  rise  in  oil  price  increased  future  demand  for \nrenewable energy, which led to an increase in investment into renewable technology, \n\nthat  government \n\ninvestment \n\n\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61\n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 836 \n \n\nTaghizadeh-Hesary et al. \n\nthereby resulting in a price reduction in solar modules through technological advances. \nThis is consistent with the results from past researches that suggested that a decline in \noil  prices  led  to  renewable  technology  advances.  Meanwhile,  the  coefficient  for  the \nUnited  States  takes  a  positive  value.  This  is  because  the  energy  substitution  rate \nbetween renewable energies and crude oils is high in the United States. \n\n5.  CONCLUSION AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS \n\n\ud835\udc64\n\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f)\n\nIn  this  paper,  we  have  examined  the  influence  of  wage,  interest  rate,  exchange  rate, \nR&D  expenditure,  and  oil  price  on  the  price  of  solar  modules  for  five  major  solar \nmodule  producing  countries.  As  precedent  works  focused  mainly  on  the  supply  side \nfactor of the economy, we have assumed that the consideration of potential economic \nfactors  would  give  us  new  insights  into  the  mechanism  surrounding  the  recent  cost \nreduction  in  solar  modules.  We  have  constructed  a  solar  module  pricing  model  and \nconducted a fully modified OLS (FMOLS) to estimate the influence of each factor. Our \nempirical  analysis  results  gave  several  findings  concerning  the  solar  module  pricing \n)  have  a  positive  correlation  with  solar \nmechanism.  Wage  (\n),  and  oil  price \nmodule  prices  (\n.  There  are  several \n\nhave  a  negative  correlation  with  solar  module  prices  (\n\n)  and  interest  rate \n,  while  exchange  rate  (\n\n),  knowledge  stock  (\n\n(\ud835\udc5f\n\n\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f)\n\nsolar energy policy recommendations that can be made based on these findings.  \n(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59) \nFirst, government must expand channels for renewable energy funding. As renewable \nindustries  are  high-tech,  the  influence  that  capital  cost  has  on  technology  price  is \nsignificant.  Government  efforts  to  provide  industries  with  low-interest  finance  will \naccelerate renewable business. There have been many attempts to lower interest rates \nfor renewable energy technology to accelerate growth in the green technology market. \nFor example, top solar module producing countries such as Malaysia and the Republic \nof  Korea  have  started  what  is  called  green  technology  financing,  which  enables \nrenewable energy companies to loan money at a low interest rate. Similarly, there are \nreports  from  REN21  (2017)  that  state  that  the  role  of  third-party  financing  may  also \nbecome  strong  in  the  solar  energy  industry.  In  the  United  States,  the  development  of \nthird-party financing has become strong and IEA-PVPS assumes that the lower capital \ncosts driven by these parties have contributed to new installations of solar systems in \nrecent years. These past attempts at lowering interest rates for renewable energy loans \nwill be effective in further reducing prices for solar modules as well as enhancing solar \nenergy  installation  growth.  Therefore,  the  government  must  lower  interest  rates  for \nsolar module industry to be able to finance manufacturing. \n\n\ud835\udc34\n\n\ud835\udc52\n\nSecond,  government  must  expand  R&D  expenditures  toward  renewable  energy \nresearch  and \nthrough \ntechnological  advancements  acquired \ntechnology.  The \ndevelopment  enhance  module  performance  efficiency, \nthereby  reducing  cost. \nTherefore,  government  policies  aimed  at  increasing  R&D  expenditure  will  be  an \neffective procedure for expanding the installation of renewable energies. However, the \ndifferences  in  environmental  regulations  and  the  objectives  of  R&D  expenditure  will \nhave different effects on solar module price. Therefore, specifying the objective of R&D \nwill  be  necessary  to  acquire  the  expected  result  of  price  reduction.  Moreover,  the \ninfluence of corporate R&D expenditure was not taken into consideration due to a lack \nof coverage in solar industry surveys. If the influence of corporate R&D expenditure on \nsolar  module  price  is  strong,  the  exclusion  of  the  series  will  have  a  critical  impact  on \nthe  analysis  results.  Therefore,  using  corporate  R&D  expenditure  as  an  independent \nvariable  may  give  us  a  better  understanding  of  the  role  of  solar  R&D  in  reducing \ntechnology costs. \n\n \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 836 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nTaghizadeh-Hesary et al. \n\nArrow, K.

One  of  the  key  drivers  behind  this  growth  is  the  decline  in \nsolar module prices. Thus, the price reduction mechanism in solar modules has become an \nimportant  topic  as  the  role  of  solar  electricity  in  the  overall  energy  supply  and  the  market \nvalue  of  solar  modules  grow  globally.  Many  empirical  analyses  have  been  carried  out  to \nunveil  the  mechanism  behind  this  price  reduction.  However,  the  researches  performed  on \nthe price reduction mechanism of solar modules over the years have focused purely on the \ntechnological aspect of the manufacturing. When analyzing price, the influence of economic \nfactors  such  as  interest  rate  and  exchange  rate  must  also  be  taken  into  consideration  to \nachieve a precise analysis. In this paper, an oligopolistic model and econometric method are \nused to determine the economic factors that have an influence on solar module prices. \n \nKeywords: solar modules, renewable energy, price reduction \n \nJEL Classification: Q21, Q28, E43 \n \n", " \n"]}
