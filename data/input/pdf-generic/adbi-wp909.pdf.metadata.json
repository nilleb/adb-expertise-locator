INTRODUCTION TO SMES AND SME FINANCING  \n\nIN PAKISTAN \n\nPeople  frequently  refer  to  small  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs)  as  the  backbone  of  \nan  economy.  This  analogy  reflects  how  integral  SMEs  are  in  terms  of  generating \nemployment  and  contributing  to  the  GDP.  However,  their  importance  does  not \nautomatically  make  them  priority  recipients  of  financing  from  financial  institutions. \nRather,  SMEs\u2019  lack  of  access  to  finance  is  a  widespread  phenomenon,  common  to \ndeveloped and developing countries (ADB 2015; OECD 2017).  \n\nSMEs  represent  approximately  90%  of  the  enterprises  in  Pakistan  and  provide \nemployment for nearly 80% of the non-agricultural labor force, according the country\u2019s \nSmall and Medium Enterprise Development Authority\u2019s (SMEDA) estimate. In addition, \nthey contribute 30% to the GDP; 25% to the exports of manufactured goods; and 35% \nto  the  manufacturing  value  added  (SBP  2017a).  Despite  these  sizable  contributions, \ntheir  share  of  the  total  private  sector  financing  of  banks  and  DFIs  fell  from  17%  in \nDecember 2006 to around 8.7% at the end of December 2017, according to data from \nthe SBP.1 \n\nSME  credit  took  off  after  2002  owing  to  some  key  support  factors.  First,  the  banking \nsystem had considerable liquidity. Banks\u2019 deposit mobilization grew 14% year on year \nin  the  fiscal  year  2001\u20132002  (FY02)  alone  (i.e.  between  July  2001  and  June  2002);  \nthis  was  the  strongest  growth  in  deposits  since  FY97.  The  major  impetus  came  from  \nan  improvement  in  the  country\u2019s  external  account  after  September  2001.  Against  the \nbackdrop  of  a  considerable  current  account  surplus,  the  central  bank  made  foreign \ncurrency market purchases of US$3.9 billion during FY02; for the domestic economy, \nthis meant that there was a large corresponding injection of fresh rupee liquidity. At the \nsame time, given the relatively subdued demand for bank funding from the government \nduring this period, banks were in search of other profitable avenues. SMEs fit the bill, \nespecially since the macroeconomic environment was favorable and businesses were \nperforming well at this stage.  \n\nHowever,  from  2008  onwards,  the  economy  experienced  a  downturn.  While  the \nfinancial  crisis  raging  across  the  globe  added  to  the  uncertainty,  in  Pakistan,  it  was  \nthe  worsening  energy  shortages  and  rising  security  issues  that  affected  businesses. \nSMEs  were  perhaps  the  hardest  hit;  as  non-performing  loans  (NPLs)  began  to  climb \n(Figure 1) and banks began to demand higher interest rates, further compounding the \ncash flow constraints that SMEs faced.  \n\nBanks that booked losses on their SME portfolios during this episode largely avoided \nSME financing for the next five years. Only after 2013, with macroeconomic indicators \nshowing  signs  of  recovery  and  the  central  bank  (SBP)  providing  encouragement,  did \nbanks cautiously begin to approach SMEs again. To this day, many bankers regard the \nrelatively high SME NPL ratio with trepidation.2 However, a recent study suggests that \nthere is a legacy impact of toxic assets, claiming that the fresh NPL ratio is merely 8%, \nrather  than  the  near  20%  SME  NPL  ratio  that  studies  reported  until  recently  (Aslam  \nand  Sattar  2017).  Essentially,  the  overall  SME  NPLs  seem  to  be  inflated  because  \n\n                                                 \n1   Source: SBP Quarterly SME Finance Review, December 2017. http://www.sbp.org.pk/departments/ihfd-\n\nqdr-FReview.htm \n\n2   The SME NPL ratio was as high as 22.1% in March 2017, though it had subsided to 18.3% by March \n2018.

Finally,  the \nfactors  that  people  typically  associate  with  limited  access  to  finance  for  SMEs\u2014such  \nas  insufficient  collateral,  weak  credit  information  and  reporting  systems,  inadequate \nrecovery  mechanisms,  and  so  on\u2014were  also  applicable  in  Pakistan\u2019s  case  (since \nthese  aspects  have  already  been  discussed  at  length  in  earlier  chapters,  we  do  not \nreproduce them here to avoid duplication). \n\nRecently,  there  have  been  some  signs  that  a  recovery  in  SME  financing  may  be \nunderway.  For  instance,  a  bank  lending  survey  that  the  SBP  conducted  during  \nQ1-FY18 suggested that the demand for loans and availability of funds was higher than \nin  Q1-FY17  (SBP  2017c).  However,  a  word  of  caution  is  necessary:  whether  bank \nfinancing  of  SMEs  has  firmly  taken  root  will  become  apparent  as  interest  rates  trend \nupward  and  the  yields  on  government  securities\u2014particularly  long-term  paper\u2014rise \nenough to entice banks once again. Lately, when the policy rate maintained a historic \nlow  of  5.75%3 and  the  yields  on  government  securities  were  contained,  banks  were \nthemselves  exploring  alternative  avenues  to  divert  their  liquidity,  and  the  SBP\u2019s \nincentives  to  encourage  SME  financing  emerged  at  an  opportune  time.  It  remains  to  \nbe  seen  just  how  gradually  (or  drastically)  banks  will  rebalance  their  lending  and \ninvestment portfolios if the lure of high-yielding government securities returns. \n\n                                                 \n3   The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) cut the policy rate by 25 basis points in May 2016 to a historic \nlow  of  5.75%.  Monetary  policy  decisions  subsequently  maintained  the  rate  until  November  2017.  This \nchapter was submitted prior to the January 2018 MPC meeting. \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 909 \n \n\nNadeem and Rasool \n\n2.  STATUS OF THE CREDIT GUARANTEE SCHEME \n\n(CGS) IN PAKISTAN \n\nThe  SBP  launched  the  CGS  for  Small  and  Rural  Enterprises  (hereafter  referred  to \nsimply  as  the  \u201cCGS\u201d)  in  March  2010  with  the  assistance  of  government  and  donor \nagencies.4 In  keeping  with  the  typical  aim  of  such  schemes,  the  goal  was  to  help  to \nalleviate the severe credit rationing for small and rural enterprises. The intention of the \nCGS was not to be a permanent source of support; rather, it aimed to act as a sort of \nstopgap measure that banks could utilize to realign their strategic direction in favor of \nmeeting SMEs\u2019 financing needs on a sustainable basis. \n\nThe salient features of the CGS at the time of its launch were5: \n\nCapital structure: The Financial Inclusion Programme, funded by the UK\u2019s Department \nfor  International  Development  (DFID),  allocated  initial  seed  money  of  around  \nRs1.4  billion  approximately  US$6  million).  There  was  anticipation  that  the  scheme \nwould  attract  additional  funding  from  the  Government  of  Pakistan,  international  donor \nagencies, and the private sector over time.6  \n\nAreas  of  financing  and  target  clients:  Regarding  its  geographical  focus,  the  CGS \nreserved  50%  of  its  fund  for  small  and  rural  enterprises  from  three  less  developed \nregions  of  Pakistan.  It  intended  to  allocate  the  remaining  50%  amongst  selected \nclusters in other parts of the country. The scheme targeted the following major priority \nfisheries, \nclusters:  surgical  instruments,  sports  goods, \nagricultural  services  (like  cold  storage,  quality  seeds  and  fertilizer,  bio  gas,  etc.),  and \nretail enterprises. New and collateral-deficient borrowers were the priority. \n\nfans,  ceramics,  cutlery, \n\nRisk sharing: The scheme originally guaranteed up to 60% of the participating financial \ninstitutions\u2019  (PFIs\u2019)  fresh  portfolio  of  financing  to  small  and  rural  enterprises,  whereas \nthe PFIs themselves bore the remaining 40% of the risk.  \n\nGuarantees: The scheme aimed to guarantee the portfolio of new loans of a PFI that \nmet  its  specific  CGS  criteria  (partial  guarantee,  extended  on  individual  basis)  to  the \nextent of its allocated credit guarantee limit (CGL). \n\nGuarantee fee: The CGS provided a free facility for PFIs. \n\nPricing:  Broadly,  the  applicable  mark-up  rate  would  be  a  maximum  of  the  3-month \nKarachi Interbank Offered Rate (KIBOR) plus 300 bps.  \n\nSelection  of  PFIs:  Commercial  banks  received  an  invitation  to  show  their  willingness  \nto  participate  in  the  scheme.  Then,  to  allocate CGLs  to  each  PFI,  the SBP  evaluated \nand  rated  the  willing  banks  on  pre-established  criteria:  factors  like  the  PFI\u2019s  branch \nnetwork in SME clusters/agriculture target areas, share of SME and agriculture finance \nin  total  advances,  SME  and  agriculture  NPLs,  and  small  business  and  agriculture \nfinance experience. \n\n                                                 \n4   In  this  chapter,  we  have  restricted  our  focus  to  the  SBP\u2019s  CGS  for  Small  and  Rural  Enterprises.  A \nseparate Microfinance Credit Guarantee Facility was also launched in 2010; however, it had a different \nset  of  objectives,  participants,  and  dynamics,  suited  to  a  separate  study.  The  CGS  that  we  chose  to \nanalyze is more relevant to SMEs. Until the end of 2017, it mostly targeted the \u201cS\u201d portion, that is, small \nenterprises  (SEs);  however,  in  the  future,  the  scheme  will  also  cater  to  medium  enterprises  (MEs), \naccording to the new Policy for Promotion for SME Finance (SBP 2017b). \n\n5   Extracted/paraphrased  from  SMEFD  Circular  No.  01  of  2010,  dated  19  March  2010,  as  cited  in  the \n\nAppendix. \n\n6   As  of  December  2017,  the  DFID\u2019s  contribution  amounted  to  Rs3.3  billion  (approximately  US$30.2 \n\nmillion), while the federal government\u2019s contribution was Rs300.0 million (around US$2.8 million). \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 909 \n \n\nNadeem and Rasool \n\nEligibility of borrowers: The selection criteria required eligible borrowers, among other \nthings,  to  have  regular  and  estimable  positive  cash  flows,  be  within  the  defined  \ntarget  market,  be  in  conformity  with  the  Prudential  Regulations  for  SMEs/Agriculture \nFinancing, have a clean e-CIB record, and be above average borrowers, in line with the \ncredit policy of banks. \n\nLoan  limit  and  tenure  of  guaranteed  amount:  The  original  intention  was  that  the \nscheme  would  offer  both  short-  and  medium-term  loans  of  up  to  three  years  for  \nboth working capital and medium-term capital needs, with the guarantee extending to \nloans up to a maximum amount of Rs5 million (approximately US$58,000) for a single \nborrower. However, the loan limit for the subsistence farmers under the scheme must \nnot exceed Rs0.5 million (approximately US$5,800). \n\nPayment  of  claims:  The  scheme  would  pay  50%  of  the  claim  (with  the  total  claim \ncapped  at  60%  of  the  outstanding  loan  amount)  to  the  lender  when  the  loan  was \ncategorized  as  doubtful  and  the  remaining  50%  of  the  claim  at  the  time  of  loss. 7 \nHowever, the expectation was that banks would continue with their regular procedure \nfor the recovery of loans and report their status to the CGO on a yearly basis. As soon \nas it had recovered the loan, the PFI was obliged to return the proportionate share of \nthe CGS to the guarantee fund. \n\nMonitoring  of  guaranteed  portfolios:  The  Banking  Inspection  Department  of  the  SBP \nwould  review  the  guaranteed  loan  portfolios  of  PFIs  during  its  regular  and  special \ninspections of the PFIs to ensure compliance. \n\nThat said, the scheme revised several of its provisions over time. For instance, based \non  negative  feedback  from  PFIs  on  mark-up  and  sector/regional  restrictions,  the \nscheme  underwent  modification  in  2011  to  relax  the  restrictions.  At  the  same  time,  it \nlowered  the  guarantee  share  to  40%  of  the  outstanding  principal  amount,  and  there \nwas an upward revision of the financing limits. In addition, to make the scheme more \ninclusive,  microfinance  banks  were  also  able  to  participate  in  the  scheme  from \nDecember 2012.8 \n\nRegarding the current status, lending under the CGS has risen, with both the number \nof  guaranteed  borrowers  and  the  amounts  sanctioned  increasing  notably  over  time \n(Figure  2).  A  lone  exception  occurred  in  2015,  when  the  incremental  flow  of  lending \nremained  relatively  low  due  to  a  dip  in  one  main  beneficiary  bank\u2019s  utilization\u2014\nalthough  most  of  the  smaller  banks  showed  better  utilization  during  the  year. \nEssentially, this lower flow reflected the dominance of one big commercial bank in the \nCGS portfolio. To avoid such a sharp decline in the future, the SBP duly diversified the \nCGS portfolio to ensure more inclusive participation by banks.  \n\nIn  total,  the  CGS  has  facilitated  lending  to  around  32,000  borrowers,  financing  an \namount  of  Rs25.1  billion  (approximately  US$227  million)  by  December  2017.  The \nsector breakdown shows that around 21,000 small farmers and 9,000 small and micro \nenterprises have received loans under the CGS. Over 4,000 borrowers have benefitted \nfrom clean lending.  \n\n \n\nOnce  we  start  disaggregating  the  data,  though,  some  imbalances  emerge.  For \ninstance, the province-wide distribution reveals that the CGS activity is heavily skewed, \nwith  Balochistan  in  particular  lagging  behind  among  the  four  provinces  (Figures  3a  \n\n                                                 \n7   Changed to a 100% claim on loss categorization of a loan in 2011 (SMEFD Circular No. 02 of 2011). \n8   The  interested  reader  may  refer  to  the  Appendix  for  a  complete  list  of  circulars  documenting  the \n\nchanges. \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 909 \n \n\nNadeem and Rasool \n\nand  3b).  Meanwhile,  the  high  CGS-specific  financing  activity  in  Punjab  is  in  line  with  \nthe  broader  province-wise  lending  pattern;  specifically,  Punjab\u2014the  most  populous \nprovince  of  Pakistan\u2014accounted  for  nearly  50%  of  the  bank  advances  to  the  private \nsector as of the end of December 2017.9  \n\nFigure 2: Utilization of the CGS for Small and Rural Enterprises \n\nRHS = right-hand side. \n\n* Latest available data at time of manuscript submission. \n\nSource: State Bank of Pakistan. \n\n \n\nFigure 3: Borrowers and Amounts Sanctioned by Province \n\n \n\nSource: State Bank of Pakistan. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n9   According  to  the  provisional  estimates  of  the  6th  Population  and  Housing  Census  2017  conducted  by  \nthe Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, Punjab remains the most populous province of Pakistan, accounting \nfor  nearly  53%  of  the  country\u2019s  207.8  million  population.  The  source  for  province-wise  data  of  bank \nadvances is the SBP. \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 909 \n \n\nNadeem and Rasool \n\nMoreover, though the intention was that the CGS, among other things, would provide \nsupport  for  collateral-deficient  borrowers,  the  data  disaggregated  by  the  value  of \ncollateral reveal that, in the vast majority of cases, the value of collateral for guaranteed \nloans exceeds 100% of the value of the loan (Figures 4a and 4b). One explanation for \nthis  is  that  banks  with  some  previous  experience  of  dealing  with  agriculture  financing \ncontinued  to  serve  this  segment  under  the  CGS.  Therefore,  the  value  of  collateral \n(often  land,  in  the  case  of  agriculture  financing)  tended  to  be  higher  than  the  loan \namounts. While it seems counterintuitive for the value of collateral to exceed 100% of \nthe loan in spite of the CGS cover, the scheme did not explicitly prevent such practices, \nkeeping  in  the  mind  the  trade-off  with  utilization:  given  that  the  market  norm  was  to \nrequire  at  least  a  30%  margin  over  and  above  the  financing  amount,  it  was  felt  that \nrestricting the value of collateral over 100% of the loan value would involve a trade-off \nin PFIs\u2019 utilization of the scheme. The anticipation was that the market would gradually \ncatch  on  to  the  CGS  dynamics  and  demand  lower  collateral  from  borrowers  as  time \nprogressed.  However,  given  that  this  self-adjustment  was  largely  missing,  the  SBP \nultimately  linked  the  risk  coverage  ratio  with  the  level  of  collateralization  in  January \n2017. While the trend of over collateralization had admittedly not occurred until a year \nafter  the  introduction  of  the  tiered  risk  coverage  mechanism  (judging  by  December \n2017, the numbers presented in Figure 14.4a and Figure 14.4b), the expectation is that \nthe situation will nonetheless improve gradually in the future.  \n\nMoving on to the gender distribution, the disaggregated results again leave much to be \ndesired (Figure 5). In terms of the number of borrowers and the amounts sanctioned, \nfemales  remain  clearly  disadvantaged  relative  to  men.  Naturally,  it  is  necessary  to \nassess  this  trend  while  keeping  in  mind  the  broader  exclusion  of  women  from  the \nfinancial system in Pakistan; according to the World Bank\u2019s Global Financial Inclusion \ndatabase,  only  3%  of  women  in  the  country  had  an  account  with  a  formal  financial \ninstitution  compared  with  around  14%  of  men  in  2014.  Thus,  the  anticipation  ex  ante \nwas  gender  disparity  in  the  CGS  numbers.  Even  so,  the  sharp  contrast  evident  in \nFigure 14.5 calls for corrective action.  \n\nFigure 4: Value of Collateral, as % of Loan Stock \n\nSource: State Bank of Pakistan. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 909 \n \n\nNadeem and Rasool \n\nFigure 5: Gender-wise Distribution \n\nRHS = right-hand side. \n\nSource: State Bank of Pakistan. \n\n3.  CASE STUDIES \n\n \n\nTo  supplement  the  hard  data  with  qualitative  insights,  we  interviewed  commercial \nbankers to understand why some banks fared relatively better in utilizing the CGS while \nothers failed to capitalize on it. Prior to this exercise, we held informal discussions with \nSBP  officials  in  charge  of  designing  and  monitoring  the  CGS.  The  predominant  view \nthat emerged from these discussions was that, barring a few exceptions, the majority of \nbanks had lagged behind in the utilization of the scheme owing to improper marketing \non their part. \n\nTo  assess  this  theory,  we  framed  a  conceptual  model  that  borrowed  elements  of  the \ninfluential  \u201c4  Ps\u201d  of  marketing,  originally  credited  to  Jerome  McCarthy  in  the  1960s.  \nIn  this  model,  decision  making  in  the  domain  of  marketing  consists  of  four  central \nelements, namely product, price, place, and promotion\u2014abbreviated to the \u201c4 Ps.\u201d The \nbroad concept of the marketing mix has stood the test of time, while researchers have \ntweaked specific elements as required. For example, Keller and Kotler (2016) offered \nthe  additional  4  Ps  of  modern  management:  people,  processes,  programs,  and \nperformance. Combining the elements that we deemed to be the most relevant to our \nCGS study, we initially proposed a customized 5 P model consisting of people, product, \nprocess, promotion, and price. \n\nThe intuition was that a given bank will typically develop its approach to loans for small \nand rural enterprises within the ambit of the various elements of the marketing mix. Our \ninterest was in identifying the unique traits of each bank\u2019s marketing mix and the way in \nwhich  these  were  supporting  (or  detracting  from)  its  positioning  towards  (a)  SME \nbanking and financing in general and (b) CGS utilization. \n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 909 \n \n\nNadeem and Rasool \n\nNext, we determined that the case study approach was well suited to the analysis. The \ncase  study  method  has  certain  advantages  and  limitations  compared  with  other \napproaches, like econometrics or survey analysis, as Yin (2011) documented in detail. \nTo clarify at the outset, we did not mean these case studies to be representative of all \nPFIs associated with the CGS. Their intended purpose was to add value to our general \nunderstanding  of  how  commercial  banks  are  approaching  SME  financing  as  well  as \nwhether (and how) the CGS has had an impact on their lending methods.  \n\nPresently, we interviewed senior SME officials belonging to four commercial banks. We \nadopted  the  convenience  sampling  approach  while  trying  to  gather  feedback  from \nsuccess as well failure cases. On average, the interviews lasted for around one-and-a-\nhalf  hours.  While  we  utilized  a  questionnaire  consisting  of  open-ended  questions  to \nensure that the interviews remained on track, the discussion was semi-structured; the \nordering of the questions was varied, and we posed follow-up questions on the spot to \nprobe further, whenever appropriate. \n\nThe  following  are  the  three  case  studies  developed  from  in-depth  interviews. \nClarification is necessary here: while we interviewed officials from four banks, one bank \npreferred  to  give  us  insights  off  the  record.  Respecting  its  preference,  we  did  not \ndevelop  a  separate  case  study  on  this  bank  and  only  used  the  insights  that  its \nrepresentatives shared to inform our policy recommendations. Secondly, apart from the \nBank Alfalah case, we have employed fictional names in the other two cases. We left \nthe  decision  regarding  whether  to  identify  the  bank  by  name  or  to  employ  a  fictional \nname  to  the  bank\u2019s  discretion.  From  our  viewpoint,  obtaining  candid  views  was  the \ntopmost priority; if a bank was more willing to share its views openly only if we did not \nidentify it by name, this was a compromise that we were prepared to make. \n\nFinally,  to  prevent  any  confusion  on  the  reader\u2019s  part,  while  our  5  Ps  marketing  mix \nframework  originally  included  \u201cprice\u201d  as  one  of  the  five  elements,  the  following  case \nstudies  do  not  contain  a  separate  sub-section  on  this  element.  This  is  because  the \npricing  aspect  eventually  proved  to  be  a  non-consideration  in  the  sense  that  all  \nthe  banks  that  we  interviewed  had  similar  views  on  the  pricing  of  guaranteed  vs.  \nnon-guaranteed  loans.  Essentially,  the  interviewees  were  of  the  view  that  banks  in \nPakistan have not yet fully moved towards risk-based pricing for individual SME loans \nand may take some time to mature to that level.  \n\nThus,  each  subsequent  case  study  consists  of  four  numbered  sub-sections  only \n(People,  Product,  Processes,  and  Promotion).  After  the  detailed  case  studies,  we \npresent  a  summary  of  the  key  findings  from  the  three  cases  in  Table  1  for  \nready reference. \n\n3.1  Case Study I: Bank Alfalah \n\nBank  Alfalah  strengthened  its  focus  on  SMEs  around  four  years  ago.  The  first  two \nyears  following  this  strategic  shift  were  fairly  challenging  and  involved  a  significant \nlearning  curve  to  understand  and  serve  the  SME  segment  efficiently.  The  bank\u2019s \npersistence  was  rewarded:  even  though  its  total  assets  of  Rs988  billion  (around  \nUS$9 billion) do not place it among the top-3 largest banks in Pakistan, Bank Alfalah\u2019s \nRs41  billion  (around  US$371  million)  SME  portfolio  as  of  December  2017  places  it \namong the top-3 banks in terms of SME portfolio size, and the bank has ambitions to \nbecome  the  market  leader  in  the  years  to  come.  More  broadly,  the  bank\u2019s  increasing \nbranch  network  reflects  its  growth  orientation,  as  the  number  of  branches  increased \nfrom 471 in 2012 to 638 by 2017, while the number of permanent employees rose from \n6,666 to 7,698 during the same period.  \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 909 \n \n\nNadeem and Rasool \n\nThe following are some of the distinct features of Bank Alfalah\u2019s marketing mix. Some \nfeatures  pertain  to  SME  banking  in  general,  while  others  facilitate  financing  for  small \nand rural enterprises via the CGS. \n\n3.1.1  People \n\nBank  Alfalah  espouses  the  belief  that  commitment  to  SME  banking  amongst  the  top \nmanagement is crucial. Once it has established this commitment, it can flow top-down \nthroughout  the  organization,  bringing  about  the  change  in  mindset  required  to  cater  \nto SMEs.  \n\nIn Bank Alfalah\u2019s specific case, the realization that the corporate and consumer lending \navenues  were  increasingly  becoming  saturated  gave  birth  to  the  realization  that  the \nbank  needed  to  target  a  new  segment,  namely  SMEs.  The  bank  then  systematically \nbolstered  its  human  resources  by  recruiting  professionals  who  had  a  proven  track \nrecord of dealing with the SME segment.  \n\nMoreover, Bank Alfalah trains its existing resources and potential clientele. In terms of \ninternal  capacity  building,  the  bank  encourages  its  relationship  managers  (RMs) \neffectively to become business advisors for SME clientele, a role that RMs can take on \nonly after they have undergone specialized training and achieved certification from the \nbank.  In  addition,  Bank  Alfalah  offers  non-financial  advisory  services  to  its  SME \nclientele in the knowledge that this hand holding will serve the bank\u2019s best interests in \nthe long run. \n\n3.1.2  Product \n\nBank  Alfalah  feels  that  its  strengths  include  its  accessibility  (via  its  branch  network),  \nits  service  standards,  and  the  flexibility  with  which  it  approaches  SME  banking.  In \nparticular,  the  bank  prides  itself  on  a  product  design  philosophy  that  it  grounds  on \nneeds assessment and a client-friendly customer interface rather than a one-size-fits-\nall approach or imitation of widely used products and services.  \n\nBank  Alfalah  recognizes  that  financing  is  just  one  aspect  of  SME  banking  and  that \nSMEs  require  a  few  services  beyond  credit,  such  as  cash  management  and  non-\nfinancial  advisory  services.  The  bank  segments  its  target  market  on  a  number  of  \nbases, such as by sector, industry, and geography, to create offerings that match the \nclients\u2019 needs.  \n\nThe  bank  is  prepared  to  extend  financing  to  those  enterprises  that  are  on  the  verge  \nof  value  generation\u2014meaning  they  are  not  yet  well  established  and  require  some \nfinancial and non-financial support to become so. Moreover, the bank appreciates that \nSME development requires time and thus remains open to the idea of extending term \nloans of 5\u201310 years\u2019 duration. \n\nWith  specific  reference  to  the  CGS,  Bank  Alfalah  feels  that  the  scheme  gives  it  the \ncomfort  to  extend  financing  in  cases  into  which  it  may  otherwise  not  have  ventured, \nsuch  as  lending  to  collateral-deficient  small  enterprises.  The  CGS  supports  its  value \nchain and cash-flow based lending, which represent a subset of the bank\u2019s substantial \ncollateral-free SME loan portfolio. \n\n \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 909 \n \n\n3.1.3  Processes \n\nNadeem and Rasool \n\nBank Alfalah initially utilized the advisory services of a renowned international financial \ninstitution  to  help  to  set  up  its  SME  department  and  process  flows.  To  this  day,  the \nbank  continues \nlike \nleverage  partnerships,  collaborating  with \nKarandaaz (a nonprofit company that promotes access to finance for small businesses) \nand the SMEDA to good effect.  \n\nlocal  players \n\nto \n\nAs far as approvals for SME loans are concerned, Bank Alfalah has moved towards a \nrelatively  decentralized  decision-making  approach  over  time  in  the  pursuit  of  quicker \nturnaround  times  for  loan  applications.  In  certain  cases,  the  bank  has  granted  local \narea  managers  greater  powers,  with  a  simultaneous  reduction  in  the  role  of  the  risk \nmanagement department at the approval stage. However, this was a gradual shift away \nfrom the earlier centralized setup and was only possible after a considerable learning \ncurve in the handling of SME financing. \n\nIn  relation  to  the  CGS,  the  bank  disseminates  relevant  information  pertaining  to  the \nscheme, including details of the periodic revisions that the SBP has made, through its \ninternal SME helpdesk. Bank Alfalah\u2019s SME Head personally supervises this helpdesk \nand designed it to ensure that officials at all levels, from RMs to senior management, \nhave current knowledge of the various products, policies, and regulations pertaining to \nSME banking.  \n\nFurthermore,  the  bank  has  an  innovative  approach  geared  towards  making  optimal \nutilization of its CGS limit. Having initially obtained the CGS cover against lending to a \nfresh client, Bank Alfalah typically removes the client from the scheme\u2019s coverage after \na period of around two years, which it deems to be sufficient time to develop a sense of \ncomfort  regarding  the  client.  With  its  available  limit  thus  replenished,  the  bank  then \nlends to another fresh client under the cover of the CGS. Thus, via rotation, it retains a \ngreater proportion of riskier loans under the cover at any point in time. \n\n3.1.4  Promotion \n\nRather  than  simply  relying  on  SMEs  to  approach  one  of  its  branches,  Bank  Alfalah \nadopts a proactive approach to promotional activities. As part of its \u201cmarket-storming\u201d \nactivities, officials don the bank\u2019s T-shirts, identify a high-potential SME cluster (like an \nindustrial  area),  and  conduct  outlet-by-outlet  visits  to  small  enterprises  to  generate \nleads. On other occasions, the bank collaborates with the SBP and SMEDA to set up \nhelpdesks  for  interacting  with  SMEs.  Recently,  the  bank  has  also  begun  to  advertise \ndetails  of  schemes  that  are  relevant  to  SMEs\u2014like  the  SME  refinance  scheme\u2014via  \nits ATMs. \n\nThat  said,  Bank  Alfalah  considers  brochures  and  word-of-mouth  promotion  to  be \namong  the  most  effective  ways  to  promote  its  offerings.  In  addition  to  being  cost \neffective, the word-of-mouth approach works because small enterprise owners tend to \nhave  a  close,  interconnected  network;  serve  one  client  effectively  and  he/she  will \nhappily spread the word among his/her network or community of SMEs. \n\n3.2  Case Study II: Zakir Bank10 \n\nZakir Bank ranks among the top-10 banks in Pakistan in terms of total assets. It largely \nfocuses its lending to SMEs on seasonal financing, that is, short-term financing linked \nto  agriculture  crop  cycles.  Nevertheless,  the  bank  has  recently  undergone  major \n                                                 \n10  Fictional  name.  We  have  deliberately  withheld  details  relating  to  the  bank\u2019s  total  assets,  SME  loan \n\nportfolio, number of branches, and number of employees to maintain the bank\u2019s anonymity. \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 909 \n \n\nNadeem and Rasool \n\nrestructuring,  which  is  expected  to  bring  about  changes  in  the  way  in  which  it \napproaches  SME  financing.  Zakir  Bank\u2019s  management  acknowledges  that  the  bank \nhas so far been unable to utilize the SBP\u2019s CGS to its full potential and attributes this \nprimarily  to  a  lack  of  awareness  of  the  scheme\u2019s  benefits  at  certain  organizational \nlevels within the bank.  \n\nThe following are some of the distinct features of Zakir Bank\u2019s marketing mix. \n\n3.2.1  People \n\nRegional  heads  play  a  pivotal  role  in  the  bank\u2019s  SME  operations.  The  bank  assigns \nthem targets and expects them to meet these targets through the dedicated efforts of \ntheir  resources.  Some  proactive  regions  regularly  surpass  even  ambitious  targets, \nwhereas  others  tend  to  lag  behind,  and  this  is  primarily  due  to  the  dynamism  of  the \nregional heads. \n\nAs  mentioned  earlier,  Zakir  Bank\u2019s  strength  is  seasonal  financing.  Intuitively,  from  a \nregional  head\u2019s  perspective,  if  the  region  can  achieve  profitability  with  the  quick \nturnaround times associated with seasonal financing alone, there may be little incentive \nto venture into general financing and extend long-term loans. To address this aspect, \nZakir  Bank  is  now  training  its  regional  offices  about  the  dynamics  and  merits  of \nexploring  general  financing.  Specifically,  the  bank\u2019s  management  is  keen  to  create  a \nbetter  mix  of  seasonal  and  general  financing  to  offset  the  sharp  troughs  that  it  is \nexperiencing  currently,  as  soon  as the  seasonal  demand  declines.  Zakir  Bank  is  also \neducating its regional heads and credit officers about the potential benefits that it can \ngain from greater participation in the CGS, which, in principle, may enable the bank to \nextend general financing even in certain collateral-deficient cases. \n\n3.2.2  Product \n\nZakir Bank\u2019s seasonal loans tend to be short term, typically around 6\u20138 months\u2019 tenor, \nwith  disbursement  and  retirement  linked  to  rice,  cotton,  and  wheat  crop  cycles.  The \nbank has not made inroads into value chain financing yet. \n\nIt  has,  encouragingly,  designed  separate  policies  for  SEs  and  MEs,  in  line  with  the \nSBP\u2019s directives; these were reportedly pending board approval as of December 2017. \nOnce  it  has  approved  these  policies,  Zakir  Bank  will  be  in  a  better  position  to  design \nseparate products and offerings for its small and medium clientele.  \n\n3.2.3  Processes \n\nRegarding lending decisions, there are three main layers. Layer 1 comprises the area \ncredit manager and the Commercial and SME Centre (CSC) Head. Currently, this layer \ndoes not have power of approval; it only recommends SME financing cases to layer 2, \nat which the regional head has the first power of approval. For cases that exceed the \ndesignated  authority  of  the  regional  head,  the  head  office  (i.e.  the  third  layer)  makes \nthe finance decision. From 2018 onwards, though, Zakir Bank intends to extend powers \nof  approval  to  a  certain  point  for  layer  1  as  well.  The  intention  is  to  expedite  the \nprocessing and turnaround time for smaller loans. \n\n3.2.4  Promotion \n\nThe  CSC  Head  is  in  charge  of  marketing  activities  across  the  relevant  region. \nMarketing  for  the  various  branches  in  a  region  is  centralized  in  a  bid  to  improve  the \nturnaround time.  \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 909 \n \n\nNadeem and Rasool \n\nThe  bank  deems  word-of-mouth  marketing  to  be  the  most  efficient  channel  for  SME \nmarketing; the emphasis is on serving the existing SME clients well, in the expectation \nthat  these  satisfied  SMEs  will  then  spread  the  word  about  Zakir  Bank  among  their \nnetworks.  Other  marketing  activities  include  outreach  to  corporations,  with  the  aim  of \ncross-selling to SME vendors in their supply chain, as well as liaison with associations \nthat have linkages with SMEs. \n\n3.3  Case Study III: Jalib Bank11 \n\nLike  Zakir  Bank,  Jalib  Bank  ranks  among  the  top-10  banks  in  the  country  in  terms  \nof  total  assets.  The  bank  established  a  separate  SME  department  in  2012,  which \nprovided  a  major  impetus  to  its  SME  portfolio.  Moreover,  Jalib  Bank  began  to \nparticipate  actively  in  the  CGS  for  Small  and  Rural  Enterprises  from  2013.  Initially,  it \nconcentrated  the  CGS  cover  heavily  on  lending  to  rural  enterprises.  However,  since \n2015,  the  bank  has  expanded  its  focus  to  small  enterprises  as  well.  Presently,  Jalib \nBank is actively catering to the SME segment through its extensive branch network. \n\nThe following are salient features of the bank\u2019s marketing mix. \n\n3.3.1  People  \n\nJalib Bank\u2019s management has a pragmatic approach to SME banking. Having made a \nfirm commitment to focusing on SMEs in 2012, it has consolidated its presence in this \nsegment over time. As far as the CGS is concerned, the bank is among the top utilizers \nof the scheme. That said, its share of guaranteed loans as a proportion of the bank\u2019s \noverall  SME  portfolio  remains  miniscule.  This  reflects  the  bank\u2019s  view  that  the  CGS \nmerely provides added comfort at this stage rather than being a core component of its \nSME financing strategy. \n\nRegarding investment in its SME staff, the bank pays due attention to capacity building. \nBank  officials  cite  extended  training\u2014such  as  that  imparted  to  management  trainees, \nwhich spans several months and consists of classroom learning and field rotations\u2014as \nbeing particularly effective interventions compared with shorter-duration training spread \nover two to three days, which may not have such a lasting impact.  \n\n3.3.2  Product \n\nJalib Bank engages in both program lending and conventional lending for SMEs. The \nbank has around seven distinct products that are designed to suit the requirements of \nthis  segment.  These  include  dealer  finance,  vendor  finance,  fleet  finance,  school \nfinance,  seasonal  finance,  and  so  on.  The  bank  has  also  tried  to  tap  the  potential  of \nfemale-owned  enterprises,  including  day  care  centers  and  clinics  requiring  financing  \nfor  medical  equipment.  While  dealer  finance  is  a  collateral-free  product,  most  other \nofferings  include  some  element  of  collateral.  Jalib  Bank  derived  comfort  from  the  risk \ncover made available by the CGS against such products and plans to extend the menu \nof similar CGS-backed products in the future.  \n\nJalib  Bank  feels  that  there  is  scope  to  develop  unique  products,  keeping  the \nparameters of the CGS in mind. However, it is of the view that this would be feasible if \n(a) there was surety that the scheme would continue for a committed period (say, 5 to \n10 years) as opposed to the looming possibility that it may cease abruptly and (b) the \n\n                                                 \n11  Fictional  name.  We  have  deliberately  withheld  details  relating  to  the  bank\u2019s  total  assets,  SME  loan \n\nportfolio, number of branches, and number of employees to maintain the bank\u2019s anonymity. \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 909 \n \n\nNadeem and Rasool \n\nrevisions of the scheme\u2019s parameters were minimal, because these tend to disrupt the \nstrategic approach that the bank adopts. \n\nRegarding  value-added  services,  the  bank  assists  SME  clients  in  preparing  their \nfeasibility studies, account statements, and application formalities. However, until now, \nthis  did  not  occur  in  a  particularly  structured  way.  Moving  forward,  the  bank  plans  to \ntake  up  the  provision  of  formal  non-financial  advisory  services,  being  aware  that  the \ncentral bank (SBP) has also advocated this direction.  \n\n3.3.3  Processes \n\nJalib Bank took some technical assistance from the IFC in the earlier stages, when it \nrolled out its SME department, and acknowledges that this support helped the bank to \nestablish its loan collection setup. However, beyond this initial assistance, the bank has \nadopted  and  refined  its  SME-specific  processes  using  the  expertise  of  its  internal \nresources  and  feels  that  it  has  sufficient  understanding  of  the  local  SME  dynamics \nwithout having to rely on external specialists.  \n\nThe  hierarchy  of  SME-serving  personnel  is  broadly  composed  of  credit  marketing \nofficers,  who  report  to  a  hub  manager,  who  in  turn  reports  to  a  regional  assistant \ngeneral  manager  for  credit.  In  addition,  around  17\u201318  SME  specialists  are  located  at \nthe head office. \n\nFor product-based lending, the approval authority rests with the regions, whereas, for \nconventional  lending,  some  authority  to  approve  smaller  loans  is  delegated  to  lower \nlevels.  Importantly,  the  bank  has  also  made  an  effort  to  separate  its  risk  function, \nembedding it within six major regional hubs.  \n\n3.3.4  Promotion \n\nJalib Bank reaches out to SMEs via seminars, exhibitions, and promotional activities in \nconjunction with associations. It also taps the knowledge base of the SMEDA, with the \nresearch  studies  that  the  latter  has  conducted  serving  as  useful  inputs  for  the  bank\u2019s \nproduct development efforts.  \n\nMoreover,  the  bank  utilizes  its  extensive  clientele  and  branch  network  to  good  effect; \nfor example, banners and standees placed within its branches are an effective way to \nundertake internal marketing. With respect to technology and digital marketing, though \nthe bank has taken advantage of these channels on the consumer side (e.g., facilitation \nof  consumer  loans  via  ATMs),  it  has  not  yet  leveraged  them  in  outreach  efforts  for \nSMEs,  mainly  because  the  bank  feels  that  the  majority  of  its  potential  clientele  is  not \nliterate or technically savvy enough to appreciate or benefit from this approach. \n\nTable  1  summarizes  the  key  findings  of  the  aforementioned  case  studies  for  quick \nreference. \n\n \n\n \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 909 \n \n\nNadeem and Rasool \n\n \nPeople \n\nProduct \n\nProcesses \n\nPromotion \n\nTable 1: Summarized Findings from the Case Studies in Terms  \nof the Adapted 4 Ps Marketing Model \n\n(I) Bank Alfalah \n\nCommitment to SME \nbanking among top \nmanagement.

CHALLENGES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND \nEFFECTIVENESS OF THE CGS IN PAKISTAN \n\nIn addition to bank-specific dynamics, the case study interviews revealed some broad \nchallenges relating to the CGS that are common across multiple banks. For instance, it \nis  reasonable  to  expect  that  the  CGS  will  appeal  most  to  those  banks  that  have  a \ndemonstrated focus on SMEs, as Bennett, Doran, and Billington (2005) discovered in \nthe case of a credit guarantee company established in Egypt in 1989.  \n\nHowever, in Pakistan\u2019s experience with the CGS thus far, this mindset has been largely \nelusive. An unpublished development impact study revealed that only one PFI explicitly \nlinked  participation  in  the  CGS  with  profitability,  whereas  other  considerations \nmotivated  the  remaining  PFIs\u2014like  being  part  of  a  broader  development  agenda, \nsupporting  the  central  bank\u2019s  initiatives  for  financial  inclusion,  and  contributing  to  the \ncountry\u2019s economic development (APEX Consulting 2016). Significantly, the one bank \nthat  did  associate  CGS  participation  with  profitability  in  this  impact  study  was  also \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 909 \n \n\nNadeem and Rasool \n\nconvinced  that  SME  financing,  in  general,  was  a  key  driver  of  profitability.  Our  case \nstudy interviews echoed similar sentiments.  \n\nHence,  first,  a  pre-condition  for  the  effectiveness  of  the  CGS  may  be  to  generate \ncommitment  and  buy-in  amongst  the  top  management  of  banks  regarding  SME \nbanking.  In  this  context,  some  key  findings  from  the  IFC\u2019s  experiences  (IFC  2007, \n2010) suggest that, to maximize the impact, banks seeking to tap SME banking may:  \n\n\u2022  Segment  by  type  of  client,  with  reference  to  aspects  like  industry,  ownership \n\n\u2022  Determine  priority  target  segments  in  line  with  the  bank\u2019s  own  strengths  and \n\n\u2022  Segregate  sales  and  risk  so  that  credit  approval  lies  outside  the  domain  of \n\nstructure, and trade;  \n\nweaknesses; \n\nrelationship managers;  \n\n\u2022  Segregate sales and relationship management;  \n\n\u2022 \n\nInvest in the product development skills of bank staff;  \n\n\u2022  Adopt a proactive approach to client acquisition by mining internal and external \n\nmarket data;  \n\n\u2022  Utilize  low-cost  delivery  channels  to  minimize  the  costs  of  SME  relationship \nmanagement, like call centers, Internet banking, direct marketing, and so on;  \n\n\u2022  Adopt effective data systems that automate portfolio monitoring.  \n\nEncouragingly, the case studies developed in this chapter reveal that banks in Pakistan \nare adopting some of the above-mentioned measures\u2014like prioritizing target segments \nand separating the risk and sales function. Meanwhile, there is room to develop other \naspects, such as the utilization of technology and low-cost delivery channels to reach \nSMEs,  the  mining  of  internal  and  external  market  data,  and  so  on.  At the  same  time, \nwith  a  view  to  mitigating  information  asymmetries  and  facilitating  banks\u2019  assessment  \nof  SMEs,  policy  makers  may  consider  pursuing  the  establishment  of  a  credit  risk \ndatabase  (CRD),  similar  to  the  one  operating  in  Japan.  In  contrast  to  the  personally \nidentifiable information that credit bureaus tend to collect, the Japanese CRD collects \nanonymous  data  relating  to  SME  credit,  thus  circumventing  concerns  relating  to \nprivacy;  furthermore,  by  pooling  information,  it  enables  users  to  develop  a  profile  of  \nthe average borrower in a group and facilitates the creation of reliable scoring models \nthat  can  ultimately  enable  banks  to  gauge  the  creditworthiness  of  SMEs  better \n(Kuwahara et al. 2015). \n\nNaturally,  adequate  training  remains  a  core  requirement  to  ensure  the  CGS\u2019s \neffectiveness.  The  banks  highlighted  a  scarcity  of  SME  specialists  during  the \ninterviews.  Moreover,  the  training  of  SMEs  tends  to  be  even  more  challenging,  given \nthe  diversity  of  SMEs  and  the  fairly  heterogeneous  background  of  their  owners.  Our \ninterviews  with  commercial  bankers  revealed  a  certain  skepticism  regarding  the \ncapability of the majority of SMEs to benefit from training; frequently, they cited the low \nliteracy  level  as  a  binding  constraint.  In  fact,  financial  literacy  is  even  scarcer,  with \nestimates suggesting that only around 26% of adults in Pakistan are financially literate \n(Klapper,  Lusardi,  and  Van  Oudheusden  2015).  It  is  hardly  a  surprise,  therefore,  that \nmost  commercial  bankers  whom  we  spoke  to  seemed  disinclined  to  engage  in \nsystematic  hand  holding  for  SME  clientele  of  their  own  volition,  such  as  through  the \nprovision  of  non-financial  advisory  services  (NFASs).  However,  now  that  the  central \nbank has categorically advised banks to introduce NFASs (SBP 2017b), this attitude is \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 909 \n \n\nNadeem and Rasool \n\nlikely  to  change;  the  expectation  is  that  the  banks,  the  SBP,  and  the  SMEDA  (the \nrelevant public sector SME association) will collaborate to make this training effective. \n\nMore  widely,  financial  literacy  is  so  critical  that  it  merits  a  coordinated,  national-level \nfocus;  this  may,  among  other  things,  take  the  form  of  a  dedicated  national  strategy  \nfor  financial  education  or  be  part  of  a  holistic  strategy  to  foster  financial  inclusion \n(OECD/INFE  2012).  Pakistan  has  opted  for  the  latter,  with  financial  literacy  being  \nthe  component  of  the  broader  National  Financial  Inclusion  Strategy  (NFIS)  launched  \nin  2015.  Specifically,  the  NFIS  recommended  the  roll-out  of  phased  nationwide \nawareness and education programs covering diverse topics, including the CGS, with a \nparticular emphasis on SMEs, women, and small farmers (SBP 2015), and the central \nbank  has  been  actively  conducting  workshops  and  events  in  the  pursuit  of  this  goal \never since.  \n\nMoving on to the question of risk coverage, our interviews revealed varying responses, \nwith the majority of the banks reporting that a minimum of 50% cover was necessary \nfor  them  to  take  the  CGS  seriously,  whereas  one  bank  claimed  that  it  needed  100% \nrisk cover to enhance CGS utilization. Following the existing literature, Beck, Klapper, \nand Mendoza (2010) reviewed 76 partial credit guarantee funds across 46 developed \nand  developing  countries  and  found  that,  while  the  guarantees  offered  ranged  from \n50% to 100%, the median coverage ratio was 80%. Thus, while the provision of 100% \nrisk coverage may distort the incentives for PFIs to assess and monitor risk adequately, \nexpanding the coverage (say, from 60% to 80%) may be an option worth exploring for \npriority  segments.  In  addition,  the  guarantee  dimension  may  be  linked  to  broader \neconomic  conditions.  For  instance,  the  guarantee  cover  may  increase  in  turbulent \neconomic  times  to  compensate  for  the  higher  default  risk  on  SME  loans;  similarly,  it \nmay  reduce  when  the  economic  conditions  are  more  stable,  in  line  with  the  declining \nSME loan default risk (Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary 2016).  \n\nRegarding the current sector-specific approach, whereby banks must use 30% of their \nlimit  for  specified  sectors  that  they  select  themselves,  the  banks  interviewed  in  \nthis study did not see the value of this requirement. On the contrary, they felt that the \nSBP\u2019s sector selection\u2014based on the sectors\u2019 potential for growth, exports, and overall \nimportance  for  the  economy\u2014would  be  more  suitable.  The  SBP  may  assign  these \npriority sectors higher guarantee coverage to encourage banks to serve them through a \nmarket-based mechanism.  \n\nApart  from  the  challenges  for  the  CGS  that  surfaced  during  the  interviews,  other \nchallenges relate to the disaggregated data and figures contained in the earlier \u201cStatus \nof  the  CGS  in  Pakistan\u201d  section.  Recalling  the  skewed  province-wise  distribution,  it \nappears that the scheme\u2019s originators may have foreseen that some provinces would \nderive  disproportionately  greater  benefits  from  the  CGS  at  the  expense  of  others  if \nthere were no specific directives. This would explain the inclusion of the geographical \nrestrictions at the scheme\u2019s launch, which earmarked 50% of the guarantee funds for \ncertain  less  developed  regions.  Unfortunately,  many  PFIs  did  not  receive  the  early \ngeographical restrictions disclosed at the scheme\u2019s launch in March 2010 well, and the \nscheme relaxed them within a year.12 Subsequently, the overall lending backed by the \nCGS accelerated but at the expense of an even geographical dispersion. Furthermore, \nthe  preference  for  collateral-deficient  borrowers  that  the  scheme  envisioned  largely \nremained unmet, and female borrowers remained under-represented. \n\n                                                 \n12  Documented in SMEFD Circular No. 02 of 2011, dated 14 February 2011 (Appendix). \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 909 \n \n\nNadeem and Rasool \n\nIn the future, addressing these geography, collateral, and gender dimensions remains \na challenge. Nevertheless, the recent measures that the SBP has taken may prove to \nbe instrumental in correction: \n\n\u2022  Geography:  It  introduced  the  concept  of  underserved  areas  in  2017,  whereby \nlending  to  underserved  areas  will  attract  60%  coverage. 13 In  addition,  in  the \nbroader  domain  of  SME  financing,  the  SBP  will  provide  provincial  targets  for \nSME financing to banks as of January 2018 (SBP 2017b). \n\n\u2022  Collateral: The SBP has linked the extent of CGS risk coverage with the level of \ncollateralization  as  of  January  2017.  Specifically,  there  will  be  60%  guarantee \ncover  on  clean  lending,  40%  cover  if  the  value  of  collateral  is  up  to  100%  of  \nthe  loan  value,  and  only  20%  cover  if  the  value  of  collateral  exceeds  the  \nloan amount.14  \n\n\u2022  Gender: The SBP has introduced a refinance cum credit guarantee scheme for \nfemale  borrowers  operating  in  underserved  areas  of  Pakistan. 15  Under  the \nscheme, PFIs can obtain refinancing of Rs1.5 million from the SBP at 0% and \nfor onward lending to female entrepreneurs in underserved areas at a markup \nof up to 5% per annum. Such loans will also be eligible for 60% risk coverage \nunder the CGS. The scheme is applicable for underserved areas; thus, it initially \nexcluded 24 districts. Now, it has further reduced the excluded districts to 10. In \nfact,  even  apart  from  this  refinance  cum  credit  guarantee  scheme,  female \nborrowers  are  eligible  for  a  60%  guarantee  under  the  CGS  for  amounts  up  to \nRs25 million (approximately US$226,000) as of January 2017.  \n\n5.  CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nSynthesizing  the  discussion  up  to  this  point  leads  us  to  the  following  policy \nrecommendations: \n\n\u2022  The CGS originators should nudge PFIs to tweak their marketing mix: The CGS \noriginators should encourage PFIs to modify their marketing mix elements\u2014like \npeople,  products,  processes,  and  promotion\u2014so  that  the  latter  can  make \noptimal use of the scheme. Ideally, these should be \u201cnudges\u201d in the tradition of \nThaler  and  Sunstein  (2008);  that  is,  the  choice  architecture  should  encourage \nPFIs to make decisions regarding their marketing mix that would make the PFIs \nbetter  off  by  making  the  choices  intrinsically  appealing  rather  than  through \nenforcement.  However,  if  severe  imbalances  persist  over  time,  the  originators \nmay ultimately issue specific directives. \n\n\u2022  Securing  the  buy-in  of  PFIs  is  essential,  especially  in  the  build-up  to  the \nscheme\u2019s  launch:  This  may  be  a  two-stage  process.  In  the  first  stage,  PFIs \nneed  to  be  convinced  that  SME  banking  and  financing  are  profitable  and  not \njust  something  that  they  need  to  pursue  because  policy  makers  are  pushing \nthem in that direction. In the second stage, they need to believe that the CGS is \na  useful  intervention  that  enables  them  to  tap  SME  financing  in  a  sustainable \nmanner. Ideally, when a CGS is launched, there should be clarity regarding its \nintended duration; any scheme with declared availability of less than five years \n\n                                                 \n13  IH&SMEFD Circular No. 01 of 2017. \n14  That said, loans extended to certain priority borrowers receive 60% guarantee cover regardless of the \n\ncollateralization level, as IH&SMEFD Circular No. 01 of 2017 documents (Appendix). \n\n15  Details given in IH&SMEFD Circular No. 05 of 2017 (Appendix). \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 909 \n \n\nNadeem and Rasool \n\n(or  with  tenure  that  is  not  specified  at  all)  may  not  convince  PFIs  to  build \nspecialized products centered on the CGS.  \n\nAnother way to promote PFIs\u2019 greater involvement in and commitment to CGS activities \nwould  be  to  involve  them  in  the  strategic  management  and  decision-making  process. \nThis  is  a  common  practice  in  OECD  member  countries;  for  instance,  the  board  of \ndirectors  of  Slovenia\u2019s  Small  Business  Development  Fund,  which  decides  which \napplications  it  will  guarantee,  consists  of  representatives  from  the  government  and \nbanks (OECD 2010). At present, the five-member Technical Committee responsible for \noverseeing  the  CGS  in  Pakistan  includes  one  representative  from  PFIs;  with  plans \nunderway  to  convert  the  CGS  into  a  credit  guarantee  company,  it  is  likely  that  the \nrepresentation of PFIs on the board of directors will be expanded even further. \n\n\u2022  Trust  building  should  be  an  ongoing  exercise:  Even  after  the  launch,  the \nscheme\u2019s  originators  would  do  well  to  conduct  extensive  consultations  with \nPFIs, especially before making any modifications to the scheme\u2019s parameters. \nSuch  trust-building  exercises  may  enable  the  originators  to  make  the  right \nchanges  on  the  first  attempt  and  reduce  the  need  to  make  frequent  revisions. \nMoreover,  the  originator  should  adopt  the  role  of  a  relationship  manager  and \nadvisor to PFIs.  \n\nFor the CGS in Pakistan specifically, the SBP may also engage with banks to address \nsome reservations regarding cumbersome reporting and a certain fear of the regulator \nimposing  penalties  if  the  banks  inadvertently  slip  up  in  implementation  (which  some \nrespondents  voiced  during  the  case  study  interviews).  By  extension,  it  may  simplify \nreporting  and  other  procedural  requirements  where  possible  and  where  the  regulator \ndeems  appropriate.  On  this  note,  the  decision  to  convert  the  existing  CGS  into  an \nindependent  credit  guarantee  company 16  (SBP  2017b)  may  also  give  PFIs  some \ncomfort if the direct involvement of the SBP recedes as a result. \n\n\u2022  The CGS originators must be prepared to develop the entire ecosystem: Even if \nits  core  domain  consists  of  financial  institutions,  the  CGS  originator  must  be \nprepared to develop the willingness and ability of borrowers as well. This may \ntake  the  form  of  undertaking  direct  interventions  (like  training  that  the  CGS \noriginator  conducts),  leveraging  partnerships  with  SME  associations  (such  as \nthe SMEDA in Pakistan\u2019s case), or nudging lenders to take up the hand holding \nand capacity building of SMEs.  \n\nIn  the  case  of  banks,  the  dearth  of  SME  specialists  may  be  addressed  by  hiring \nspecialized  batches  for  SME  banking,  with  a  focus  on  NFASs  and  cash  flow \nassessment  based  on  non-traditional  approaches.  Among  other  things,  training  may \nemphasize how bank officials may practically overcome the \u201chigh-risk\u201d stigma that may \naccompany SME lending in the bank\u2019s own internal regulations (Deelen and Molenaar \n2004)  and  how  the  guarantee  scheme  can  help  to  overcome  the  dearth  of  reliable \ninformation typically provided by SMEs. Other initiatives could include the adoption of \ndigital loan applications and loan origination systems to reduce the turnaround time and \nleveraging technology for data mining, lead generation, and marketing.  \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n16  The proposed Credit Guarantee Company may be operational by 31 December 2018, according to the \n\nPolicy for Promotion of SME Finance unveiled on 22 December 2017. \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 909 \n \n\nNadeem and Rasool \n\nIn conclusion, while the marketing mix may not be the first concern that strikes policy \nmakers  during  the  design  and  implementation  of  a  CGS,  the  observed  experience  in \nPakistan\u2019s case suggests that it can have a significant bearing on the scheme\u2019s overall \nimpact. By extension, the aforementioned recommendations could be a useful starting \npoint in plugging marketing-related gaps. For instance, with respect to the four Ps, they \nmay motivate the top management of PFIs: (i) to define strategies that outline how the \nbank  will  tap  the  full  benefit  of  the  CGS,  which  may  include  the  provision  of  new, \nspecialized products; (ii) to commit to investments in people, including the bank\u2019s own \nstaff as well as SME clientele; (iii) to streamline and decentralize processes wherever \nfeasible  so  that  it  can  extend  the  CGS  guarantees  with  minimum  delay;  and  (iv)  to \nallocate  budgets  to  marketing  activities  to  reach  the  target  market  for  CGS  offerings \n(like collateral-deficient SMEs). Moreover, if they are able to involve PFIs in framing the \nrules governing the CGS fund and its administration, policy makers may find that banks \ntake  greater  ownership  of  CGS  outcomes.  Furthermore,  the  need  to  make  frequent \nalterations in the scheme\u2019s parameters (in response to resistance or reservations that \nPFIs  raise)  may  decline,  since  the  revisions  would  occur  through  mutual  consultation \nwith PFIs in the first place.  \n\n \n\n \n\n19 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 909 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nNadeem and Rasool \n\nADB. 2015.

To  motivate  banks  to  lend  to  SMEs,  the  State  Bank  of \nPakistan introduced a \u201cCredit Guarantee Scheme for Small and Rural Enterprises\u201d in 2010. \nHowever,  the  response  to  the  scheme  was  initially  somewhat  muted,  which  may  arguably \nhave  been  due  to  factors  like  the  design  of  the  offer,  its  governance  structure,  or  the \nreluctance of financial institutions to engage with SMEs in general and the credit guarantee \nscheme in particular\u2014or a combination thereof. Nevertheless, in this paper, we confine our \nfocus to a discussion of how inadequate marketing diluted the scheme\u2019s impact. Specifically, \nseveral commercial banks could not tailor elements of their marketing mix\u2014including people, \nproducts,  processes,  and  promotions\u2014to  take  full  advantage  of  the  scheme.  That  said, \nperiodic  revisions  of  the  scheme  helped  to  address  some  of  its  shortcomings,  while  the \nexpectation is that other indicators will improve due to the recent changes in the scheme\u2019s \nparameters.  The  key  finding  is  that  policy  makers  can  maximize  the  impact  of  a  credit \nguarantee  scheme  by  paying  attention  to  the  marketing  mix,  which  sets  up  participating \nfinancial institutions for success (or failure) during the implementation phase. In addition, the \nscheme\u2019s  structure  should  be  a  long-term  intervention  and  its  intended  duration  should  be \nclear at the outset so that the participating financial institutions are motivated to design and \nroll out specialized products that tap the full potential of credit guarantees. Furthermore, the \nscheme\u2019s  originators  should  be  prepared  to  develop  the  entire  ecosystem,  which  may \ninclude some initial hand holding of SMEs. \n \nKeywords: Asian economies, SMEs, financing, credit guarantee \n \nJEL Classification: G21, G30, G32 \n \n", " \n"]}
