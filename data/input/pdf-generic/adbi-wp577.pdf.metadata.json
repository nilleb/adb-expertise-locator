INTRODUCTION \nInnovation is an expensive and risky activity. From a firm\u2019s perspective, innovation can \nbe  defined  as  a  complex  process  involving  new  ideas\u2014their  development, \ntransformation,  and  application\u2014using  knowledge  technologies,  capabilities,  and \nresources (Karlsson and Tavassoli 2015; Artz et al. 2010). Similarly, a firm engaged in \ninnovation activities is involved in many complex strategies (e.g., product, process, \nmarketing, and organizational innovation) because innovation plays a key role in the \nevolution  of  industries.  Studies  single  out  innovation  as  a  primary  driver  of  firm \ncompetitiveness  and the  ultimate source  of  productivity  and  growth  (Karlsson  and \nTavassoli 2015; Subrahmanya 2012). Not surprisingly, firms carry out innovation by \ninternal  (internal  R&D)  and  external  (R&D  collaboration)  efforts  and  have  better \ntechnological strength to produce product and process innovations because investment \nin  innovation  enhances  the  technological  advancement  and  minimizes  the  firm\u2019s \nmarginal cost of production (Ganotakis and Love 2011). \nSmall  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  are  a  driving  force  in  advanced \neconomies  due  to  their  multifunctional  contributions  to  employment,  exports,  and \ntechnological  innovation.  SMEs\u2019  flexibility,  adaptability,  effective  internal \ncommunication, and quick decision making can provide them with a competitive edge \nover large firms. However, several studies (Conte and Vivarelli 2013; Love and Roper \n1999;  Subrahmanya  2012)  have  found  that  SMEs  are  more  financially  and \nnonfinancially  constrained  than  large  firms.  A  lack  of  financial  assets,  weaker \ncompetencies, reduced absorptive capacity (to internalize external knowledge), and the \nabsence of economies of scale force SMEs to underinvest in R&D. Likewise, Demirbas \net  al.  (2011)  argue  that  SMEs  operating  in  developing  countries  often  face  extra \nbarriers  such  as  lack  of  technological  investment,  a  low  level  of  R&D,  and  skills \nshortages. Presently, the global challenges for SMEs\u2019 survival are related to promoting \nan innovative culture, improving the quality of innovation (i.e., radical innovations that \nare  supported  by  R&D),  and  encouraging  patenting  culture  for  superior  SME \nperformance. Empirical studies suggest that SMEs can use internal R&D coupled with \nexternal R&D to significantly improve innovation performance (Ceccagnoli et al. 2013). \nOpen innovation models suggest that SMEs can achieve innovation through internal  \nor external knowledge and technologies (Spithoven et al. 2013). Internal R&D alone is \nnot sufficient and SMEs\u2019 use of external R&D is equally important to achieve higher \nlevels of innovation. Numerous empirical studies have emphasized the importance of \ninternal  and  external  R&D  for  product  and  process  innovation  output  (Cohen  and \nLevinthal 1989; Stam and Wennberg 2009; A\u00f1\u00f3n-Hig\u00f3n et al. 2015; Hagedoorn and \nWang  2012).  Cohen  and  Levinthal  (1989)  suggested  that  internal  R&D  not  only \ngenerates product and process innovation but also improves firms\u2019 absorptive capacity \n(i.e., learning effect). Similarly, Lane and Lubatkin (1998) argued that external R&D \nincreases a firm\u2019s innovative output and absorptive capacity if these small firms are \nreluctant to invest alone in R&D. \nThe major contribution of this paper lies in the unique data set used, which comprises \nfirm-level  cross-sectional  data  and  allows  for  comparative  analysis  of  Indian  and \nPakistani SMEs. To the best of the author\u2019s knowledge, very few empirical studies are \navailable on the innovation performance of Indian and Pakistani SMEs. This study \nseeks  to  fill  the  research  gap.  The  study  investigates,  for  the  first  time,  the \ncomplementary relationship between internal and external R&D among Indian and \nPakistani SMEs. \n \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 577  Rehman \n \nThe results show that SMEs engaged in internal and external R&D are more likely to \nintroduce product and process innovations. However, this effect is found to be stronger \nfor Indian SMEs. Pakistani SMEs are less innovative than Indian SMEs in terms of \nundertaking R&D and generating product and process innovation. In addition, the probit \nmodels show that internal and external R&D have a complementary relationship. \n2.  THEORY AND HYPOTHESES \n2.1  Internal Research and Development \nR&D is an important intangible input asset that is significantly associated with firm \ninnovation. Innovation results from investment in R&D (Czarnitzki and Hottenrot 2011) \nbecause  R&D  increases  a  firm\u2019s  stock  of  knowledge  and  a  firm  can  utilize  that \nknowledge to introduce new products (Artz et al. 2010). Similarly, several researchers \nhave  identified  R&D  as  a  major  innovation  input  for  increasing  firms\u2019  innovation \nperformance (Conte and Vivarelli 2013; Pellegrino et al. 2014; Karlsson and Tavassoli \n2015;  Hall  and  Bagchi-Sen  2002).  Regarding  the  role  of  R&D,  numerous  studies  \nstate that R&D performs two major functions: (i) it generates new knowledge through \nproduct and process innovation, and (ii) it increases the firm\u2019s absorptive capacity \n(Cohen  and  Levinthal  1989;  Stam  and  Wennberg  2009;  Gallie  and  Legro  2012; \nCeccagnoli  et  al.  2013).1 In  other  words,  R&D  not  only  introduces  technological \ncompetencies, but it also helps the firm to absorb knowledge spillovers from external \nsources. This  suggests  that  R&D  is  an  important  indicator for measuring  a firm\u2019s \nabsorptive capacity (Gallie and Legros 2012). However, R&D is a costly and risky \ninvestment  and  requires  a  long-term  commitment  if  it  is  to  improve  the  firm\u2019s \ncompetitiveness  and  innovation  performance  (Pradhan  2011,  Ortega-Argiles  et  al. \n2009). SMEs normally carry out informal (or nonpermanent) R&D by using resources \nfrom different departments due to lack of financial and technological competencies. \nSMEs  generally  tend  to  underinvest  in  R&D  because  of  higher  uncertainty  in  the \nsuccess  of  innovative  projects  and  the  lack  of  information  between  the  firm  and \nexternal suppliers of finance. Further, small firms have limited access to internal and \nexternal finance as they cannot use their initial money and profits to invest in risky \nprojects (Czarnitzki and Delanote 2015). Sometimes, it is less expensive to imitate than \nto innovate because firm size is correlated with the availability and stability of internally \ngenerated funds (Ortega-Argiles et al. 2009). It is argued that investment in R&D  \nbelow the optimal level is very expensive and R&D subsidies and grants can alleviate \nthe  underinvestment  in  innovation  activities  (Meuleman  and  Maeseneire  2012). \nCzarnitzki  and  Delanote  (2015)  conducted  a  study  on  3,272  German  SMEs  and \nconcluded that R&D subsidies significantly boost innovation performance. A study by \nHottenrott  and  Lopes-Bento  (2012)  of  1,973  Belgian  SMEs  also  found  that  R&D \nsubsidies accelerate R&D spending and have a significant impact on firms\u2019 innovation \nperformance.  Orteg-Argiles  et  al.  (2009)  too  suggested  that  fiscal  incentives  and \nsubsidies for SMEs may overcome the problems of weaker competencies, reduced \nabsorptive capacity, and the absence of economies of scale  In yet another study, \nDemirbas et al. (2011) analyzed the barriers to innovation for 224 Turkish SMEs using \na logit model. They found that lack of government support for R&D significantly reduces \n                                                \n1  Similarly, Ornaghi (2006) states that R&D generates two types of externalities: rent spillovers (e.g., \ninvestment in goods, patent licensing, and quality improvements), and knowledge spillovers (exchange \nof information at conferences and reverse engineering).  \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 577  Rehman \n \ninnovation performance. This indicates that R&D is essential input for SME innovation, \nbecause it significantly improve the SME innovation output (Parrilli and Elola 2012).  \nFurthermore, Artz et al. (2010) conducted a panel study of US firms and found that \nR&D has a positive and significant impact on firm invention (patents) and innovation \n(new  products).  Mairesse  and  Mohnen  (2005)  examined  the  positive  relationship \nbetween R&D and product and process innovation using tobit regression analysis on \n2,253 French firms. Similarly, Ganotakis and Love (2011) conducted a study on 412 \nSMEs in the United Kingdom (UK). They revealed that internal R&D has a strong and \npositive impact on firms\u2019 product innovation. Gallie and Legros (2012) analyzed French \nfirms by using unbalanced panel data and found that R&D has significant and positive \nimpact on firms\u2019 innovation output. Further, Fritsch and Meschede (2001) examined the \npositive relationship between process R&D expenditure and firm size. This indicated \nthat large firms devote a significant portion of their R&D on process innovation because \nprocess innovation improves product quality and/or enables introduction of completely \nnew products. Likewise, Ornaghi (2006) investigated Spanish manufacturing firms and \nfound  that  knowledge  spillovers  from  R&D  improve  firms\u2019  innovation  performance. \nPradhan (2011) conducted a study of Indian manufacturing firms and found that R&D is \nan important determinant of SME performance. Interestingly, a number of researchers, \nincluding Hagedoorn and Wang (2012) and Berchicci (2013), categorized R&D into \ninternal and external R&D in their studies on innovation performance.  \n2.2  External Research and Development \nFirms can no longer rely on internal R&D and other internal capabilities (e.g., skills) to \ncope with the increasing cost of innovation, shorter product life cycles, and higher \ntechnological  complexities  (Berchicci  2013;  Bergman  2010).  This  recent  shift  from \nclosed to open innovation models has emphasized the role of external R&D activities. \nThrough such network activities (i.e., R&D alliances with universities, suppliers, and \nresearch  organizations),  firms  may  increase  their  competitiveness  and  improve \nperformance (Minarelli et al. 2013; Ahuja 2000; Cantner et al. 2010; Un et al. 2010). \nThe common goal of external R&D is to develop new products and processes by \nreducing costs. Moreover, the potential benefits of such external networks are sharing \nrisks  and  costs,  shortening  innovation  cycles,  and  exploiting  economies  of  scale \n(Hagedoorn 1990; Peltier and Naidu 2012; Colombo et al. 2011; Nieto and Santamaria \n2010; Pullen et al. 2012). In addition, external R&D cooperation provides exchange  \nof  intangible  (non-codified)  knowledge  by  means  of  people-to-people  contact  and \nincreases the market power of each cooperating partner (Teirlink and Spithoven 2013; \nKinkel and Som 2010). Specifically, SMEs can overcome the challenges of resource \nconstraints through R&D cooperation. Interestingly, the study of Teirlink and Spithoven \n(2013), based on 140 Belgian SMEs, found that micro enterprises rely more on R&D \ncooperation than other firm sizes. \nSeveral  studies  concerning  SMEs\u2019 financial  resources  suggest that they  are more \nfinancially constrained than large firms (Abor and Biekpe 2007; Beck and Kunt 2006). \nMost SMEs typically do not have sufficient internal financial resources to undertake \nR&D projects directly. This indicates that lack of financial resources reduces the SMEs\u2019 \ninnovation activities (Dundas 2006). One way to overcome this problem is through  \nR&D  collaboration  with  competitors,  suppliers,  and  universities,  which  increases \naccess to R&D spending and firm competitiveness (Hottenrott and Lopes-Bento 2012; \nDe Jong and Vermeulan 2006). The lack of resources is a barrier to SMEs\u2019 innovation \nperformance, but at the same time it is the primary motive for SMEs to search beyond \ntheir  own  boundaries  for  required  knowledge  and  innovative  ideas.  In  particular, \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 577  Rehman \n \nparticipating in R&D alliances allows firms to internalize technology spillovers, exploit \neconomies of scale, combine complementary technological skills, and minimize the \ncost of R&D  (Hottenrott and Lopes-Bento 2012). Moreover, SMEs can enhance their \ninnovation performance by drawing upon external knowledge sources including other \nfirms and research institutions (Chun and Mun 2012). Cooperative R&D agreements \nprovide SMEs with opportunities to increase their absorptive capacity because such \ncollaboration maximizes firms\u2019 internal stock of knowledge. \nA  study  by  Un  et  al.  (2010)  stated  that  R&D  collaboration  with  universities  and \nsuppliers positively influences the firms\u2019 product innovation, but such collaboration with \ncompetitors appears to have a negative impact on product innovation. This indicates \nthat not all R&D alliances positively influence product innovation. One disadvantage  \nof R&D collaboration is transaction costs, especially to cooperate, manage, and control \nR&D activities (Becker and Dietz 2004). Nevertheless, the study of Chun and Mun \n(2012) on SMEs in the Republic of Korea suggested that R&D cooperation significantly \nimproves the firms\u2019 product and process innovation. A similar finding was provided  \nby Kinkel and Som (2010) related to the German mechanical engineering industry. In \naddition, Mukherjee et al. (2013) investigated R&D alliance formation in 854 German \nSMEs. They found that inter-firm trust was more likely to encourage R&D alliances \nbecause  it  mainly  influence  product  innovations.  Specifically,  SMEs  face  more \nenvironmental  uncertainty  (i.e.,  uncertain  costs  and  benefits  of  R&D),  and  trust \nbetween  firms  can  minimize  this  problem.  Likewise,  Spithoven  et  al.  (2013) \ninvestigated the open innovation practices in 967 Belgian SMEs. They argued that \nSMEs\u2019 reliance on external R&D significantly improved product innovation. \nConcerning the link between internal and external R&D, Hagedoorn and Wang (2012) \nand Berchicci (2013) suggest that internal and external R&D have a complementary \nrelationship at higher levels of in-house R&D intensity, while at low levels of in-house \nR&D intensity both internal and external R&D have a substitutability relationship. The \ntrade-off  between  internal  and  external  R&D  influences  firms\u2019  innovation  output \n(Berchicci 2013). Similarly, a study by Bergman (2010) on Swedish firms found that \ninternal and external R&D both have a positive impact on productivity and this may \nsuggest  a  complementary  relationship  between  the  two  types  of  R&D.  Similarly, \nLokshin et al. (2006) investigated 304 Dutch firms by using a dynamic linear panel \nmodel. They found that internal and external R&D have a complementary relationship. \nAdditionally,  Ceccagnoli  et  al.  (2013)  examined  the  complementary  relationship \nbetween internal and external R&D of pharmaceutical firms and found that external \nR&D promotes innovation by fostering internal R&D activities. This finding suggests \nthat firms with external R&D must also continue to undertake internal R&D. A similar \nfinding is suggested by Piga and Vivarelli (2004) using Italian manufacturing firms. \nThey argued that internal and external R&D have a complementary relationship, which \nimplies that doing more of one increases the return on doing more of other. Likewise, \nBecker and Dietz (2004) conducted a study on 2,048 German manufacturing firms \nusing  simultaneous  equations. They found  that  internal  and  external R&D  have  a \ncomplementary relationship. Their findings suggest that external R&D drives firms to \ninvest more in the development of innovation. In other words, a firm with a sufficient \ninternal R&D base has the  absorptive capacity to benefit from external R&D activities.  \nThe above literature review suggests four main hypotheses: \nH1: Internal R&D has a positive impact on SMEs\u2019 innovation performance. \nH2: External R&D has a positive relationship with SMEs\u2019 innovation performance. \nH3: Public support for innovation has a positive association with SMEs\u2019 innovation \nperformance. \nH4: Internal and external R&D have a complementary relationship. \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 577  Rehman \n \n3.  METHODOLOGY AND DATA \nThis section provides information related to the research context of this study. The \ninnovation  activities  in  Indian  and  Pakistani  SMEs  are  compared,  along  with  data \nsources.  \n3.1  Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in India  \nand Pakistan: Research Context \nIndia and Pakistan are the two major economies of South Asia in terms of gross \ndomestic product (GDP). They share a long border and are active members of the \nSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. In 2013, India\u2019s GDP was about \n$1.9 trillion, while Pakistan\u2019s was much less at $232.3 billion. Despite tense diplomatic \nrelations between the two countries, trade (informal) between the two countries is \nnearly  $3  billion.  SMEs  in  India  contribute  17%  to total GDP  while  the figure for \nPakistan is around 40%. Indian SMEs employ nearly 15% of the national workforce \n(about 60 million people), account for 26 million enterprises, and contribute 45% of \nmanufacturing  output.  In  comparison,  SMEs  in  Pakistan  employ  75%  of  the \nnonagriculture workforce, account for 3.2 million enterprises, and contribute 30% of \nmanufacturing output. Concerning R&D investment, India has the edge over Pakistan \nrelated to overall R&D expenditure, which is equal to 1.0% of GDP compared with \n0.3% for Pakistan (World Bank 2012). \nR&D investment is essential to expand absorptive capacity and national learning but \nthe poor countries tend to do very little R&D due to their low human capital, lack  \nof research infrastructure and the lower technological capacity of the private sector \n(Goni and Maloney 2014). For instance, Pradhan (2011) found that R&D intensity \namong Indian SMEs is very low, and lower than that of large firms. A shortage of funds \nis one of the important barriers to their technological competitiveness. In addition, \nSubrahmanya (2012) found that most Indian SMEs carried out incremental innovations \nthat were driven by customer demands and confined to slight changes in product \ndesign and shapes. In comparison, a study by Subhan et al. (2014) suggested that \nPakistani SMEs need to invest in knowledge-based resources (e.g., R&D, process \ninnovation) if they hope to improve their innovation performance. Further, Pakistan has \nnot yet developed an effective national system for improving R&D spending and other \ntechnological  investment,  especially  in  the  biotech  industry.  Moreover,  outdated \ntechnologies, lack of access to credit, high interest rates on lending, and the lack of \ngovernment support are the major barriers faced by Pakistani SMEs (Berry 1998). \nOverall, the facts related to Indian and Pakistani SMEs suggest that a low level of R&D \nactivity results in fewer innovations and that the lack of access to credit and the lack of \nan innovative culture are the major obstacles to innovation for SMEs.  \n3.2  Data Source \nThe data was obtained from the World Bank Enterprise database for 2013 under the \ntitle of \u201cThe World Bank Innovation Follow-Up.\u201d This survey was initially launched in \n2011 to investigate the innovation performance of developing countries. The innovation \ndata  was  available  for  both  countries  for  the  same  year.  The  survey  gathered \ninformation  on  the  key  innovation  variables  including  R&D,  product  and  process \ninnovation,  sources  of  financing  for  innovation,  and  aspects  of  organizational  and \nmarketing innovation. The survey covered 3,492 Indian firms and 696 from Pakistan. In \nboth countries, over 75% of firms were engaged in manufacturing (textiles, tobacco, \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 577  Rehman \n \nchemicals, printing, electronics and machinery, and others) and over 15% in services \n(IT, wholesale trade, hotel and restaurants, transport, and others). \nThe majority of these firms surveyed were SMEs. This study uses dummy variables for \nfirm size. The definition followed the guidelines from the World Bank Enterprise Survey \ninstead of country-specific definitions. Small firms are defined as having 5\u201319 workers; \nmedium-sized firms, 20\u201399 workers; and large firms 100 workers of more. In India, \napproximately 28% are small firms, 45% are medium-sized, and nearly 27% are large. \nFor Pakistan, 44% are small firms, 35% are medium-sized, and 21% are large. Micro \nfirms with fewer than 5 workers were not used in the analysis. The data was gathered \nfrom 23 Indian states and in Pakistan from three provinces\u2014Punjab (54% of firms), \nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa (20.26%), and Sindh (13.36%)\u2014and the capital city of Islamabad \n(12.79%). \n3.3  A Comparison of Innovation Activities \nIndia  has  higher  internal  R&D  investment  than  Pakistan  in  plastics  and  rubber, \nmachinery,  chemicals,  electronics,  basic  metals,  and  other  sectors.  Alternatively, \nPakistani firms had higher R&D than India in food, textiles, chemicals, vehicles, retail \ntrade, and others. This indicates that the industries in the two countries are different in \nterms of undertaking internal R&D. However, in both countries the R&D intensity is \nhigher in manufacturing than in services. For comparative analysis, figures 1 and 2 \nprovide the innovation activities of Indian and Pakistani SMEs. \nAs  shown  in  Figure  1,  approximately  46%  of  the  3,492  Indian  SMEs  surveyed \nundertook  internal  R&D  compared  with  just  over  9%  of  696  Pakistani  firms.  This \nsuggests that Pakistani SMEs are much less engaged in internal R&D. The level of \nexternal R&D undertaking is very low in both countries, suggesting there are poor \nalliances or collaboration with other firms and research institutions. Further, most (65%) \nof the Indian SMEs were engaged in product innovation, compared with only 22% of \nPakistani SMEs. This information suggests that the low level of R&D by Pakistani \nenterprises  results  in  low  innovation  output.  A  similar  trend  is  found  for  process \ninnovation; nearly 61% of Indian SMEs introduced process innovation compared with \n9% of Pakistani SMEs. However, the patent and license output is low in both countries. \nThis  outcome  could  indicate  that  SMEs  in  both  countries  predominantly  introduce \nincremental innovations. Overall, Figure 1 suggests that Indian SMEs are dominant in \nterms of carrying out internal R&D and product and process innovation compared with \nPakistani SMEs. \nSMEs in both countries rely mainly (over 70%) on internal sources of financing for their \ninnovation activities (Figure 1). Interestingly, nearly 59% of Indian SMEs also financed \ntheir innovation through external borrowing from banks, but only 10% of Pakistani \nSMEs funded their innovation in this way. This suggests that Pakistani SMEs have \nsubstantially  less  access  to  external  finance  than  Indian  SMEs.  Similarly,  public \nsupport for innovation activities (R&D grants, subsidies, and tax credits) is low in both \ncountries, albeit higher in India (8.0%) than in Pakistan (about 1.5%).  \nFigure 2 provides information on R&D and product and process innovation by firm size. \nApproximately 31% of small firms in India are engaged in R&D and nearly 46% of \nmedium-sized firms. A much higher share of large firms, 63%, are engaged in R&D. In \nPakistan, only 3% of small firms undertake R&D compared with 11% of medium-sized \nfirms and 20% of large firms. Overall, the link between R&D and firm size indicates that \nlarge firms in both countries undertake more R&D than do SMEs. The level of R&D by \nSMEs is lower in Pakistan than India. \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 577  Rehman \n \nFigure 1: Innovation Activities in Indian and Pakistani Small  \nand Medium-Sized Enterprises (%)  \n100  93.9 \n90 \n80  72.75  India \n65.15 \n70  60.15  58.73 \n60  46.19  Pakistan \n50 \n40 \n30  22.17 \n1200   9.34  9.25 6.03  9.05  6.3 2.3  10.49  8.412. 44  4.73 1  10.161. 75 \n0 \n \nFigure 2: Research and Development and Product and Process Innovation  \nby Firm Size, India and Pakistan (%) \n80  71.24 \n70  63.16  62.87  63.41  68.31 \n54.99  59.41 \n60 \n45.56 \n50 \n40  30.69  28  26.47 \n30  18.25  20.29 \n20  11.06 \n13.04 \n10  3.14  8.01  8.41 \n0 \nSmall  Medium  Large  Small  Medium  Large \nIndia   Pakistan \nResearch and Development  Product Innovation  Process Innovation \n \nIn India, 63% of SMEs have introduced product innovations.

Pakistani  SMEs  have  lower \ninnovation capabilities than those in India. \n3.4  Variables  \nThe study uses two dependent variables, product innovation and process innovation, \nwhich are the key outputs of R&D and related activities (Conte and Vivarelli 2013; \nFritsch  and  Meschede  2001;  Pellegrino  et  al.  2014).  Product  innovation  provides \nmarket leadership, broadens a firm\u2019s customer base, and increases the price buyers \nare willing to pay, while process innovation reduces a firm\u2019s average cost of production \n(Wolff and Pett 2006; Cohen and Klepper 1996; De Jong and Vermeulan 2006). While \nsome studies (Hagedoorn and Cloodt 2003; Katila 2000; Liu 2009) used patent counts \n9 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 577  Rehman \n \nand  applications  as  a  proxy  for  innovation  output,  this  study  prefers  product  and \nprocess innovation over patents as dependent variables for several reasons. First, it is \nnot necessary that every innovation is patented; and second, many firms do not patent \nbecause of their reluctance to disclose information and secrecy can help to protect their \ninnovations. Moreover, in developing countries patent usage is not very common due \nto financial constraints and the low quality of innovations (Ghoneim 2003). \nThe major independent variables of interest of this study are internal and external  \nR&D. Two additional innovation input variables that are used are internal technology \nacquisition  (investment  in  machinery,  equipment,  and  software)  and  external \ntechnology acquisition (patents and licenses), which generally have a significant impact \non firms\u2019 innovation performance (Silva et al. 2012; Crespi and Zuniga 2012). The other \nindependent variables relate to firms\u2019 financial resources measured as internal funds, \nexternal bank finance, and public support (R&D subsidies and tax incentives). These \nthree explanatory variables investigate the impact of different types of finance on firms\u2019 \ninnovation output. Finally, firm size and age are added as control variables, the former \nas a dummy variable and the latter in logarithmic form. \n4.  ECONOMETRIC MODEL \n4.1  Model Specification \nA bivariate probit model is used to estimate the relationship between R&D and product \nand process innovations. This estimation method removes the sample selection bias \nand also presents more accurate parameters through the inclusion of non-innovative \nfirms (Chun and Mun 2012). Alternatively, Heckman (1979) suggested a correction \nprocedure  (i.e.,  Heckit  procedure)  for  sample  selection  bias  by  using  continuous \ndependent  variables.  However,  in  this  study,  the  dependent  variables  are \npredominantly discrete and the use of the inverse Mills ratio is not an appropriate \nchoice.  Moreover,  the  correlation  coefficient  between  the  two  unobserved  factors \n(residuals) from the two equations indicates the possible complementarities between \nthe dependent variables.

The results \nsuggest  that  firms  undertaking  internal  R&D  increase  the  probability  of  product \ninnovation by 37% and process innovation by 21%. This outcome confirms our initial \nhypothesis and is in line with similar results from Stam and Wennberg (2009) and \nGallie and Legros (2012). However, no statistical relationship is found between external \n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 577  Rehman \n \nR&D and process innovation. One possibility for the latter result is that R&D might not \nbe required for process innovation.  This apparently suggests that undertaking external \nR&D is costly for Indian SMEs with regard to process innovation.

Thus,  firms\u2019  decision  to  spend  on  machinery, \nequipment, licensing, and software generate innovation (Table 2). This result is similar \nto that of Silva et al.

Surprisingly, internal R&D shows no statistical \nassociation  with  innovation  and  therefore  rejects  the  initial  hypothesis.  There  are  \ntwo possible explanations for this outcome. First, Pakistani SMEs do not undertake \ninternal R&D because it is costly and risky. Second, Pakistani SMEs may not have the  \nR&D-related capabilities (workforce skills) to conduct internal R&D. In contrast, external \nR&D does increase the probability of introducing product innovation by 10% (it was \n21% for India). External R&D showed a strong association (nearly 44%) with process \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 577  Rehman \n \ninnovation (higher than India). This result suggests that Pakistani SMEs may overcome \nthe high costs and risks and skill-related problems through R&D alliances. However, \nthis effect is stronger for process innovation than for product innovation. \nTechnological acquisition has a positive and significant impact on product and process \ninnovation,  which  is  in  line  with  the  findings  of  Crespi  and  Zuniga  (2012).  The \ncoefficient of age shows a positive association with product innovation, implying that \nolder firms are more likely to introduce product innovation. Concerning the relationship \nbetween firm size and innovation, medium-sized firms show a positive association  \nto  product  innovation.  No  relationship  is  found  between  firm\u2019s  size  and  process \ninnovation. Regarding internal sources of financing for innovation activities, internal \nfinance is positively correlated with product innovation but it is not significant. For \nprocess innovation, the sign is negative and the variable is also insignificant. The \nparameter of external finance is also insignificant and may indicate that Pakistani \nSMEs are more externally constrained than Indian SMEs. The manufacturing sector is \nmore likely to introduce product innovations than the services sector. \n4.2.2  Productivity and Innovation \nA  number  of  researchers  have  found  that  innovation  has  a  positive  impact  on \nproductivity (Masso and Vahter 2011; Cassiman and Golovko 2007). These studies \nidentified an endogenous relationship between innovation and productivity, although \nthat endogeneity is beyond the scope of this study. Figures 3\u20136 compare the labor \nproductivity of innovators to non-innovators for India and Pakistan.3 For Indian firms \nthat are product innovators (Figure 3), the labor productivity distribution coincides with \nthat of non-product innovators. For Pakistan, the productivity of product innovators \nexceeds that of non-product innovators (Figure 5).  \nFigure 3: Productivity Difference by Product Innovation (India) \n \n   \n                                                \n3  Labor productivity is defined as a firm\u2019s total sales divided by the number of employees. Labor \nproductivity is logged. Further, OLS regression has been used to investigate the relationship between \nproductivity and innovation. However, a low R-square value (<0.05) and nonsignificant coefficients \nsuggest that the use of the OLS method is not an appropriate choice.  \n14 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 577  Rehman \n \nFigure 4: Productivity Difference by Process Innovation (India) \n \nFigure 5: Productivity Difference by Product Innovation (Pakistan) \n \nLabor productivity distribution for process innovators is coincided with non-process \ninnovators for both India and Pakistan (see Figures 4 and 6). However, in Pakistan,  \nthe labor productivity distribution of process and non-process innovators is similar \n(Figure 6).  The  lack  of  information  on  other  variables  (e.g.,  materials,  capital \ninvestment) has prevented the use of total factor productivity, which is a better indicator \nof productivity. Overall, these figures suggest that the productivity of product innovators \nhas  stochastic  dominance  over  process  innovators  in  Pakistan,  while  Indian  firms \nshowed no stochastic dominance for process innovators.  \n   \n15 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 577  Rehman \n \nFigure 6: Productivity Difference by Process Innovation (Pakistan) \n \nTable 4: Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov Test for Equality of Distribution Function \nInnovation  Labor Productivity (Yes = 1)  Labor Productivity (No = 0) \nProduct innovation (India)  0.0293  \u20130.0115 \nProcess innovation (India)  0.0198  \u20130.0351 \nProduct innovation (Pakistan)  0.1209a  \u20130.0158 \nProcess innovation (Pakistan)  0.1078  \u20130.0708 \na Indicates null hypothesis rejected at 10% significance level. \nResults of the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test for equality of distribution are provided in \nTable 4, which compares the labor productivity distribution of product and process \ninnovators for the two countries. In the case of Pakistan, the labor productivity of \nproduct innovators stochastically dominates the non-product innovators and the null \nhypothesis of no productivity difference is rejected. This implies that product innovators \ntend to be more productive than non-product innovators only for Pakistani SMEs.  \n4.2.3  Complementary Relationship between Internal and External R&D \nTo estimate the final hypothesis on the complementary relationship between internal \nand external R&D, separate probit models have been estimated (Table 4). Several \nresearchers have used R&D as the dependent variable (Pradhan 2011; Ornaghi 2006; \nPiga and Vivarelli 2004; Becker and Dietz 2004). Specifically, Piga and Vivarelli (2004) \nfound that internal and external R&D are potentially endogenous. Internal R&D is \ncorrelated with the error term in the external R&D equation. In order to avoid this \nendogeneity problem, this study has used separate probit models for each dependent \nvariable (internal and external R&D). This follows the method used by Becker and Dietz \n(2004) to estimate the complementarity between internal and external R&D. In the \ncurrent study, internal R&D and external R&D are both discrete variables so the choice \nof a probit model is appropriate. In addition, firm size is introduced as a continuous \nvariable (in logarithmic form) for two reasons. First, several researchers have used firm \nsize as a continuous variable to avoid the possible multicollinearity between firm size \n16 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 577  Rehman \n \ncategories (e.g., Demirbas et al. 2011). Second, using the sign of the coefficient of firm \nsize as a continuous variable allows for the comparison between small and large firms. \nTable 5 reports the results of the probit estimations for India and Pakistan. The link test \nis used to see whether the model is adequately satisfied without omitted variable bias. \nThe variable prediction squared has accepted the null hypothesis which shows that the \nmodel is correctly specified (Table 4).4 In the first model, a 1% increase in external \nR&D raises the probability of internal R&D by 53%. Similarly, in the second, internal \nR&D has a positive and significant impact on external R&D. In both specifications, the \nparameters for internal and external R&D are highly significant (at the \u03c1<0.01 level). \nThis outcome indicates the complementary relationship between internal and external \nR&D. External R&D motivates firms to undertake more internal R&D and expand the \nfirms\u2019 technological capabilities. This result is in line with the findings of Ceccagnoli  \net al. (2013) and Becker and Dietz (2004) and confirms the prior expectation of their \ncomplementary relationship.  \nTable 5: Probit Model Estimation (Maximum Likelihood Method) \nIndia \nInternal R&D (Model 1)  External R&D (Model 2) \nExplanatory Variables  Coefficient  Z-value  Coefficient  Z-value \nInternal R&D  \u2013  \u2013  0.4606a  6.79 \n(0.0678) \nExternal R&D  0.5399a  6.51  \u2013  \u2013 \n(0.0829) \nTechnology aquisition-1  0.5013a  10.45  \u20130.0549  \u20130.80 \n(0.0479)  (0.0689) \nTechnology acquisition-2  0.3281a  3.49  0.2849a  2.66 \n(0.0940)  (0.1069) \nLog age  0.0268  0.88  \u20130.0458  \u20131.11 \n(0.0305)  (0.0413) \nLog size  0.2571a  11.61  0.2208a  2.74 \n(0.0221)  (0.0805) \nInternal finance  0.4283a  4.55  \u20130.0370  \u20130.29 \n(0.0942)  (0.1278) \nExternal finance  0.0194  0.42  0.1742a  2.73 \n(0.0464)  (0.0637) \nPublic support  \u20130.1188  \u20131.43  0.0602  0.57 \n(0.0833)  (0.1069) \nSector  0.5440a  9.45  0.0727  0.90 \n(0.0575)  (0.0811) \nConstant  \u20131.0096a  \u20137.11  \u20131.4454a  \u20137.52 \n(0.1420)  (0.1921) \nPseudo    0.1148  0.0468 \nModel Spe\ud835\udfd0cification Test         \nPredict h\ud835\udc79at  1.0015a  21.19  0.8241  0.91 \nPredict hat\u2013square  0.0068  0.10  \u20130.0669  \u20130.19 \ncontinued on next page \n                                                \n4  A link test uses the prediction square of the model and if the prediction square does have explanatory \npower (i.e., the coefficient has significant value), it means that the model is incorrectly specified.

This outcome indicates that firms\u2019 innovation \nexpenditure is likely to increase the probability of undertaking internal R&D. However, \nin model 2 only one form of technology acquisition shows a positive association to \nexternal R&D. Overall, firm size shows a positive relationship with both internal and \nexternal  R&D.  This  outcome  suggests  Indian  and  Pakistani  SMEs  are  less  likely  \nto  engage  in  R&D  than  large  firms.  This  finding  accords  with  the  Schumpeterian  \nnotion that large firms are more innovative than small firms due to their economies of \nscale advantage. \nSimilarly,  a  positive  relationship  is  found  between  internal  and  external  R&D  for \nPakistan (Table 5). The relationship is much stronger for Pakistani firms than for those \nin India. Overall, the outcomes between internal and external R&D in Table 4 suggest \nthat both variables have a complementary relationship. Increasing internal (or external) \nR&D by a factor of 1 increases the probability of increasing external (or internal) R&D \nby a similar magnitude. Furthermore, technology acquisition increases the probability  \nof engaging in internal R&D. However, only model 4 shows a positive relationship \nbetween firm size and undertaking external R&D. This outcome implies that large firms \n18 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 577  Rehman \n \nare more likely to undertake external R&D. The coefficient of internal finance shows \nthat a 1% increase in internal finance is likely to raise internal R&D by 85%. This \nindicates that the majority of Pakistani SMEs rely on internal sources of finance for their \ninnovation activities. Lastly, public support to innovation activities (e.g., R&D subsidies \nand grants) is likely to raise external R&D.  \n5.  CONCLUSION \nThis study indicates that Indian SMEs undertake more internal and external R&D and \nintroduce more product and process innovations than Pakistani SMEs. However, SMEs \nin both the countries exhibit weak R&D collaboration with other firms or research \ninstitutions. Moreover, SMEs were mainly engaged in incremental innovations due to \nthe low level of patent protection. Similarly, public support for innovation activities in the \nform of R&D grants, subsidies, or tax credits are low for SMEs in both the countries. \nFurthermore, Pakistani SMEs are more constrained in terms of access to external \nfinance than those in India. The majority of Pakistani SMEs relied on internal source of \nfinancing for innovation output (product/process). However, internal financing was not \nsufficient to undertake internal and external R&D. In comparison, Indian SMEs used \nboth internal and external financing for accelerating their innovation output and were \nfound marginally better in terms of undertaking R&D.  \nRegarding  the  estimation  results,  this  paper  reveals  that  SMEs  engaged  in  both \ninternal and external R&D may have significantly better innovation performance. This \noutcome was found stronger for Indian SMEs because Pakistani SMEs are reluctant to \nundertake internal R&D due to the high costs and risks associated with innovation \nefforts.  Overall,  the  negative  relationship  between  firm  size  and  innovation  output \nsuggests that SMEs in both countries may be facing resource constraints. This result \nsupports the finding of Schumpeter (1942) that small firms are less innovative\u2014they \nhave lower levels of R&D, are less capital intensive, and are more risk averse than \nlarge firms. In addition, the positive relationship between internal and external R&D \nimplies a complementary relationship between these two types of R&D. This suggests \nthe  likelihood  that  investing  in  internal  R&D  would  increase  the  probability  of  \nalso engaging in external R&D, and vice versa. This result confirms the findings of \nother researchers. \nThe  study  provides  important  policy  implications.  First,  the  relationship  between \nexternal R&D and innovation output indicates that small firms in both the countries \nrequire linkages with other firms and research institutions. Network relations are a good \nsource for gaining complementary skills and absorptive capacity. Pakistani SMEs are \nat a specific disadvantage in terms of investment in internal and external R&D, and the \nlack of an R&D culture reduces firms\u2019 innovation performance. Policy instruments such \nas  R&D grants from government  agencies  are  more  beneficial  in  increasing  R&D \ninvestment and innovation output than R&D financing. It is difficult for SMEs to obtain \nR&D financing due to its risky nature (i.e., research can take a long time to generate \nresults). Overall, the negative relationship between firm size and innovation output \nsuggests that SMEs face resource constraints.  \nThe  results  imply  that  specific  policy  measures  might  be  provided  through  such \ninstitutions as the Small Industries Development Bank of India, other state financial \ninstitutions  in  India,  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  Development  Authority  of \nPakistan, and banks serving SMEs in Pakistan to remove the barriers to improving \nSMEs\u2019  innovation  performance.  In  addition,  such  instruments  as  R&D  grants  and \nsubsidies, a stronger R&D culture, the availability of external finance requiring less \n19 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 577  Rehman \n \ncollateral,  and  university\u2013industry  linkages  may  encourage  SMEs  to  improve  their \ninnovation performance. The complementary relationship between internal and external \nR&D implies that business managers can utilize a balanced combination of R&D to \nincrease innovation performance. \nThis  study  has  several  limitations.  The  unavailability  of  information  on  R&D \nexpenditure, technological acquisition expenditure, and borrowing for Pakistani SMEs \nrequired the use of less precise dummy variables. Further, longitudinal data would \nhave captured the effects of R&D more appropriately than cross-sectional data, as \nR&D  is  most  often  a  long-term  investment.  A  lower  number  of  observations  for \nPakistan than for India also affected the accuracy of the estimates. The study can be \nextended to other South Asian countries to broaden the analysis of the innovation \nperformance of SMEs. \n   \n20 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 577  Rehman \n \nREFERENCES \nAbor, J., and N.

Micro-level data was obtained for 3,492 Indian and 696 Pakistani SMEs from the World Bank\u2019s Enterprise Survey, and bivariate probit estimation techniques were used. The results show that internal and external R&D positively affects product and process innovations. However, this effect is stronger for Indian SMEs. The negative relationship between firm size and innovation output implies that SMEs in both countries face resource constraints. Further, Indian SMEs are dominant in terms of undertaking internal R&D and generating product and process innovations relative to those in Pakistan. The complementary rel\u00acationship between internal and external R&D has been examined for both countries. The study is unique in comparing Indian and Pakistani SMEs innovation activities using micro-level data. The results suggest that business managers can utilize a balanced combination of internal and external R&D to accelerate innovation output and increase absorptive capacity. Specifically, public support for innovation, such as R&D grants, subsidies, and tax credits, could encourage SMEs to undertake more radical innovations.", "Title": "Does Internal and External Research and Development Affect Innovation of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises?
