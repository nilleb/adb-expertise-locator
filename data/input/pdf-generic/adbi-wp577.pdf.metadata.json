INTRODUCTION \n\nRehman \n\ninvolving  new \n\nInnovation is an expensive and risky activity. From a firm\u2019s perspective, innovation can \nbe  defined  as  a  complex  process \nideas\u2014their  development, \ntransformation,  and  application\u2014using  knowledge  technologies,  capabilities,  and \nresources (Karlsson and Tavassoli 2015; Artz et al. 2010). Similarly, a firm engaged in \ninnovation  activities  is  involved  in  many  complex  strategies  (e.g.,  product,  process, \nmarketing,  and  organizational  innovation)  because  innovation  plays  a  key  role  in  the \nevolution  of  industries.  Studies  single  out  innovation  as  a  primary  driver  of  firm \ncompetitiveness  and  the  ultimate  source  of  productivity  and  growth  (Karlsson  and \nTavassoli  2015;  Subrahmanya  2012).  Not  surprisingly,  firms  carry  out  innovation  by \ninternal  (internal  R&D)  and  external  (R&D  collaboration)  efforts  and  have  better \ntechnological strength to produce product and process innovations because investment \nin  innovation  enhances  the  technological  advancement  and  minimizes  the  firm\u2019s \nmarginal cost of production (Ganotakis and Love 2011). \n\nfound \n\neffective \n\nflexibility, \n\nadaptability, \n\ninnovation.  SMEs\u2019 \n\nSmall  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  are  a  driving  force  in  advanced \neconomies  due  to  their  multifunctional  contributions  to  employment,  exports,  and \ninternal \ntechnological \ncommunication, and quick decision making can provide them with a competitive edge \nover large firms. However, several studies (Conte and Vivarelli 2013; Love and Roper \n1999;  Subrahmanya  2012)  have \nfinancially  and \nnonfinancially  constrained  than  large  firms.  A  lack  of  financial  assets,  weaker \ncompetencies, reduced absorptive capacity (to internalize external knowledge), and the \nabsence of economies of scale force SMEs to underinvest in R&D. Likewise, Demirbas \net  al.  (2011)  argue  that  SMEs  operating  in  developing  countries  often  face  extra \nbarriers  such  as  lack  of  technological  investment,  a  low  level  of  R&D,  and  skills \nshortages. Presently, the global challenges for SMEs\u2019 survival are related to promoting \nan  innovative  culture,  improving  the quality  of  innovation  (i.e.,  radical  innovations  that \nare  supported  by  R&D),  and  encouraging  patenting  culture  for  superior  SME \nperformance. Empirical studies suggest that SMEs can use internal R&D coupled with \nexternal R&D to significantly improve innovation performance (Ceccagnoli et al. 2013). \n\nthat  SMEs  are  more \n\nOpen  innovation  models  suggest  that  SMEs  can  achieve  innovation  through  internal  \nor external knowledge and technologies (Spithoven et al. 2013). Internal R&D alone is \nnot  sufficient  and  SMEs\u2019  use  of  external  R&D  is  equally  important  to  achieve  higher \nlevels  of  innovation.  Numerous  empirical  studies  have  emphasized  the  importance  of \ninternal  and  external  R&D  for  product  and  process  innovation  output  (Cohen  and \nLevinthal  1989;  Stam  and  Wennberg  2009;  A\u00f1\u00f3n-Hig\u00f3n  et  al.  2015;  Hagedoorn  and \nWang  2012).  Cohen  and  Levinthal  (1989)  suggested  that  internal  R&D  not  only \ngenerates product and process innovation but also improves firms\u2019 absorptive capacity \n(i.e.,  learning  effect).  Similarly,  Lane  and  Lubatkin  (1998)  argued  that  external  R&D \nincreases  a  firm\u2019s  innovative  output  and  absorptive  capacity  if  these  small  firms  are \nreluctant to invest alone in R&D. \n\nThe major contribution of this paper lies in the unique data set used, which comprises \nfirm-level  cross-sectional  data  and  allows  for  comparative  analysis  of  Indian  and \nPakistani SMEs. To the best of the author\u2019s knowledge, very few empirical studies are \navailable  on  the  innovation  performance  of  Indian  and  Pakistani  SMEs.  This  study \nseeks  to  fill  the  research  gap.  The  study  investigates,  for  the  first  time,  the \ncomplementary  relationship  between  internal  and  external  R&D  among  Indian  and \nPakistani SMEs. \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 577 \n \n\nRehman \n\nThe  results  show  that  SMEs  engaged  in  internal  and  external  R&D  are more  likely  to \nintroduce product and process innovations. However, this effect is found to be stronger \nfor  Indian  SMEs.  Pakistani  SMEs  are  less  innovative  than  Indian  SMEs  in  terms  of \nundertaking R&D and generating product and process innovation. In addition, the probit \nmodels show that internal and external R&D have a complementary relationship. \n\n2.  THEORY AND HYPOTHESES \n\n2.1  Internal Research and Development \n\nR&D  is  an  important  intangible  input  asset  that  is  significantly  associated  with  firm \ninnovation. Innovation results from investment in R&D (Czarnitzki and Hottenrot 2011) \nbecause  R&D  increases  a  firm\u2019s  stock  of  knowledge  and  a  firm  can  utilize  that \nknowledge to introduce new products (Artz et al. 2010). Similarly, several researchers \nhave  identified  R&D  as  a  major  innovation  input  for  increasing  firms\u2019  innovation \nperformance (Conte and Vivarelli 2013; Pellegrino et al. 2014; Karlsson and Tavassoli \n2015;  Hall  and  Bagchi-Sen  2002).  Regarding  the  role  of  R&D,  numerous  studies  \nstate  that  R&D  performs  two  major  functions:  (i)  it  generates  new  knowledge  through \nproduct  and  process  innovation,  and  (ii)  it  increases  the  firm\u2019s  absorptive  capacity \n(Cohen  and  Levinthal  1989;  Stam  and  Wennberg  2009;  Gallie  and  Legro  2012; \nCeccagnoli  et  al.  2013). 1  In  other  words,  R&D  not  only  introduces  technological \ncompetencies,  but  it  also  helps  the  firm  to  absorb  knowledge  spillovers  from  external \nsources.  This  suggests  that  R&D  is  an  important  indicator  for  measuring  a  firm\u2019s \nabsorptive  capacity  (Gallie  and  Legros  2012).  However,  R&D  is  a  costly  and  risky \ninvestment  and  requires  a  long-term  commitment  if  it  is  to  improve  the  firm\u2019s \ncompetitiveness  and  innovation  performance  (Pradhan  2011,  Ortega-Argiles  et  al. \n2009).  SMEs  normally  carry  out  informal  (or  nonpermanent)  R&D  by  using  resources \nfrom different departments due to lack of financial and technological competencies. \n\nSMEs  generally  tend  to  underinvest  in  R&D  because  of  higher  uncertainty  in  the \nsuccess  of  innovative  projects  and  the  lack  of  information  between  the  firm  and \nexternal  suppliers  of  finance.  Further,  small  firms  have  limited  access  to  internal  and \nexternal  finance  as  they  cannot  use  their  initial  money  and  profits  to  invest  in  risky \nprojects (Czarnitzki and Delanote 2015). Sometimes, it is less expensive to imitate than \nto innovate because firm size is correlated with the availability and stability of internally \ngenerated  funds  (Ortega-Argiles  et  al.  2009).  It  is  argued  that  investment  in  R&D  \nbelow the optimal level is very expensive and R&D subsidies and grants can alleviate \nthe  underinvestment  in  innovation  activities  (Meuleman  and  Maeseneire  2012). \nCzarnitzki  and  Delanote  (2015)  conducted  a  study  on  3,272  German  SMEs  and \nconcluded  that  R&D  subsidies  significantly  boost  innovation  performance.  A  study  by \nHottenrott  and  Lopes-Bento  (2012)  of  1,973  Belgian  SMEs  also  found  that  R&D \nsubsidies accelerate R&D spending and have a significant impact on firms\u2019 innovation \nperformance.  Orteg-Argiles  et  al.  (2009)  too  suggested  that  fiscal  incentives  and \nsubsidies  for  SMEs  may  overcome  the  problems  of  weaker  competencies,  reduced \nabsorptive  capacity,  and  the  absence  of  economies  of  scale    In  yet  another  study, \nDemirbas et al. (2011) analyzed the barriers to innovation for 224 Turkish SMEs using \na logit model. They found that lack of government support for R&D significantly reduces \n\n                                                \n1   Similarly,  Ornaghi  (2006)  states  that  R&D  generates  two  types  of  externalities:  rent  spillovers  (e.g., \ninvestment in goods, patent licensing, and quality improvements), and knowledge spillovers (exchange \nof information at conferences and reverse engineering).  \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 577 \n \n\nRehman \n\ninnovation performance. This indicates that R&D is essential input for SME innovation, \nbecause it significantly improve the SME innovation output (Parrilli and Elola 2012).  \n\nFurthermore,  Artz  et  al.  (2010)  conducted  a  panel  study  of  US  firms  and  found  that \nR&D  has  a  positive  and  significant  impact  on  firm  invention  (patents)  and  innovation \n(new  products).  Mairesse  and  Mohnen  (2005)  examined  the  positive  relationship \nbetween  R&D  and  product  and  process  innovation  using  tobit  regression  analysis  on \n2,253  French  firms.  Similarly,  Ganotakis  and  Love  (2011)  conducted  a  study  on  412 \nSMEs in the United Kingdom (UK). They revealed that internal R&D has a strong and \npositive impact on firms\u2019 product innovation. Gallie and Legros (2012) analyzed French \nfirms by using unbalanced panel data and found that R&D has significant and positive \nimpact on firms\u2019 innovation output. Further, Fritsch and Meschede (2001) examined the \npositive  relationship  between  process  R&D  expenditure  and  firm  size.  This  indicated \nthat large firms devote a significant portion of their R&D on process innovation because \nprocess innovation improves product quality and/or enables introduction of completely \nnew products. Likewise, Ornaghi (2006) investigated Spanish manufacturing firms and \nfound  that  knowledge  spillovers  from  R&D  improve  firms\u2019  innovation  performance. \nPradhan (2011) conducted a study of Indian manufacturing firms and found that R&D is \nan important determinant of SME performance. Interestingly, a number of researchers, \nincluding  Hagedoorn  and  Wang  (2012)  and  Berchicci  (2013),  categorized  R&D  into \ninternal and external R&D in their studies on innovation performance.  \n\n2.2  External Research and Development \n\nFirms can no longer rely on internal R&D and other internal capabilities (e.g., skills) to \ncope  with  the  increasing  cost  of  innovation,  shorter  product  life  cycles,  and  higher \ntechnological  complexities  (Berchicci  2013;  Bergman  2010).  This  recent  shift  from \nclosed to open innovation models has emphasized the role of external R&D activities. \nThrough  such  network  activities  (i.e.,  R&D  alliances  with  universities,  suppliers,  and \nresearch  organizations),  firms  may  increase  their  competitiveness  and  improve \nperformance  (Minarelli  et  al.  2013;  Ahuja  2000;  Cantner  et  al.  2010;  Un  et  al.  2010). \nThe  common  goal  of  external  R&D  is  to  develop  new  products  and  processes  by \nreducing costs. Moreover, the potential benefits of such external networks are sharing \nrisks  and  costs,  shortening  innovation  cycles,  and  exploiting  economies  of  scale \n(Hagedoorn 1990; Peltier and Naidu 2012; Colombo et al. 2011; Nieto and Santamaria \n2010;  Pullen  et  al.  2012).  In  addition,  external  R&D  cooperation  provides  exchange  \nof  intangible  (non-codified)  knowledge  by  means  of  people-to-people  contact  and \nincreases the market power of each cooperating partner (Teirlink and Spithoven 2013; \nKinkel  and  Som  2010).  Specifically,  SMEs  can  overcome  the  challenges  of  resource \nconstraints through R&D cooperation. Interestingly, the study of Teirlink and Spithoven \n(2013),  based  on  140  Belgian  SMEs,  found  that  micro  enterprises  rely  more  on  R&D \ncooperation than other firm sizes. \n\nSeveral  studies  concerning  SMEs\u2019  financial  resources  suggest  that  they  are  more \nfinancially constrained than large firms (Abor and Biekpe 2007; Beck and Kunt 2006). \nMost  SMEs  typically  do  not  have  sufficient  internal  financial  resources  to  undertake \nR&D projects directly. This indicates that lack of financial resources reduces the SMEs\u2019 \ninnovation  activities  (Dundas  2006).  One  way  to  overcome  this  problem  is  through  \nR&D  collaboration  with  competitors,  suppliers,  and  universities,  which  increases \naccess to R&D spending and firm competitiveness (Hottenrott and Lopes-Bento 2012; \nDe Jong and Vermeulan 2006). The lack of resources is a barrier to SMEs\u2019 innovation \nperformance, but at the same time it is the primary motive for SMEs to search beyond \ntheir  own  boundaries  for  required  knowledge  and  innovative  ideas.  In  particular, \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 577 \n \n\nRehman \n\nparticipating  in  R&D  alliances  allows  firms  to  internalize  technology  spillovers,  exploit \neconomies  of  scale,  combine  complementary  technological  skills,  and  minimize  the \ncost of R&D  (Hottenrott and Lopes-Bento 2012). Moreover, SMEs can enhance their \ninnovation  performance  by  drawing  upon  external  knowledge  sources  including  other \nfirms  and  research  institutions  (Chun  and  Mun  2012).  Cooperative  R&D  agreements \nprovide  SMEs  with  opportunities  to  increase  their  absorptive  capacity  because  such \ncollaboration maximizes firms\u2019 internal stock of knowledge. \n\nA  study  by  Un  et  al.  (2010)  stated  that  R&D  collaboration  with  universities  and \nsuppliers positively influences the firms\u2019 product innovation, but such collaboration with \ncompetitors  appears  to  have  a  negative  impact  on  product  innovation.  This  indicates \nthat  not  all  R&D  alliances  positively  influence  product  innovation.  One  disadvantage  \nof R&D collaboration is transaction costs, especially to cooperate, manage, and control \nR&D  activities  (Becker  and  Dietz  2004).  Nevertheless,  the  study  of  Chun  and  Mun \n(2012) on SMEs in the Republic of Korea suggested that R&D cooperation significantly \nimproves  the  firms\u2019  product  and  process  innovation.  A  similar  finding  was  provided  \nby  Kinkel  and  Som (2010) related  to the German  mechanical  engineering  industry. In \naddition,  Mukherjee  et  al.  (2013)  investigated  R&D  alliance  formation  in  854  German \nSMEs.  They  found  that  inter-firm  trust  was  more  likely  to  encourage  R&D  alliances \nbecause  it  mainly  influence  product  innovations.  Specifically,  SMEs  face  more \nenvironmental  uncertainty  (i.e.,  uncertain  costs  and  benefits  of  R&D),  and  trust \nbetween \nthis  problem.  Likewise,  Spithoven  et  al.  (2013) \ninvestigated  the  open  innovation  practices  in  967  Belgian  SMEs.  They  argued  that \nSMEs\u2019 reliance on external R&D significantly improved product innovation. \n\nfirms  can  minimize \n\nConcerning the link between internal and external R&D, Hagedoorn and Wang (2012) \nand  Berchicci  (2013)  suggest  that  internal  and  external  R&D  have  a  complementary \nrelationship at higher levels of in-house R&D intensity, while at low levels of in-house \nR&D  intensity  both  internal  and  external  R&D  have  a  substitutability  relationship.  The \ntrade-off  between  internal  and  external  R&D  influences  firms\u2019  innovation  output \n(Berchicci  2013).  Similarly,  a  study  by  Bergman  (2010)  on  Swedish  firms  found  that \ninternal  and  external  R&D  both  have  a  positive  impact  on  productivity  and  this  may \nsuggest  a  complementary  relationship  between  the  two  types  of  R&D.  Similarly, \nLokshin  et  al.  (2006)  investigated  304  Dutch  firms  by  using  a  dynamic  linear  panel \nmodel. They found that internal and external R&D have a complementary relationship. \nAdditionally,  Ceccagnoli  et  al.  (2013)  examined  the  complementary  relationship \nbetween  internal  and  external  R&D  of  pharmaceutical  firms  and  found  that  external \nR&D  promotes  innovation  by  fostering  internal  R&D  activities.  This  finding  suggests \nthat  firms  with  external  R&D  must  also  continue  to  undertake  internal  R&D.  A  similar \nfinding  is  suggested  by  Piga  and  Vivarelli  (2004)  using  Italian  manufacturing  firms. \nThey argued that internal and external R&D have a complementary relationship, which \nimplies that doing more of one increases the return on doing more of other. Likewise, \nBecker  and  Dietz  (2004)  conducted  a  study  on  2,048  German  manufacturing  firms \nusing  simultaneous  equations.  They  found  that  internal  and  external  R&D  have  a \ncomplementary  relationship.  Their  findings  suggest  that  external  R&D  drives  firms  to \ninvest  more  in  the  development  of  innovation.  In  other  words,  a  firm  with  a  sufficient \ninternal R&D base has the  absorptive capacity to benefit from external R&D activities.  \n\nThe above literature review suggests four main hypotheses: \n\nH1: Internal R&D has a positive impact on SMEs\u2019 innovation performance. \nH2: External R&D has a positive relationship with SMEs\u2019 innovation performance. \nH3:  Public  support  for  innovation  has  a  positive  association  with  SMEs\u2019  innovation \nperformance. \nH4: Internal and external R&D have a complementary relationship. \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 577 \n \n\nRehman \n\n3.  METHODOLOGY AND DATA \n\nThis  section  provides  information  related  to  the  research  context  of  this  study.  The \ninnovation  activities  in  Indian  and  Pakistani  SMEs  are  compared,  along  with  data \nsources.  \n\n3.1  Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in India  \n\nand Pakistan: Research Context \n\nIndia  and  Pakistan  are  the  two  major  economies  of  South  Asia  in  terms  of  gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP).  They  share  a  long  border  and  are  active  members  of  the \nSouth  Asian  Association  for  Regional  Cooperation.  In  2013,  India\u2019s  GDP  was  about \n$1.9 trillion, while Pakistan\u2019s was much less at $232.3 billion. Despite tense diplomatic \nrelations  between  the  two  countries,  trade  (informal)  between  the  two  countries  is \nnearly  $3  billion.  SMEs  in  India  contribute  17%  to  total  GDP  while  the  figure  for \nPakistan  is  around  40%.  Indian  SMEs  employ  nearly  15%  of  the  national  workforce \n(about  60  million  people),  account  for  26  million  enterprises,  and  contribute  45%  of \nmanufacturing  output.  In  comparison,  SMEs  in  Pakistan  employ  75%  of  the \nnonagriculture  workforce,  account  for  3.2  million  enterprises,  and  contribute  30%  of \nmanufacturing  output.  Concerning  R&D  investment,  India  has the  edge over  Pakistan \nrelated  to  overall  R&D  expenditure,  which  is  equal  to  1.0%  of  GDP  compared  with \n0.3% for Pakistan (World Bank 2012). \n\nR&D  investment  is  essential  to  expand  absorptive  capacity  and  national  learning  but \nthe  poor  countries  tend  to  do  very  little  R&D  due  to  their  low  human  capital,  lack  \nof  research  infrastructure  and  the  lower  technological  capacity  of  the  private  sector \n(Goni  and  Maloney  2014).  For  instance,  Pradhan  (2011)  found  that  R&D  intensity \namong Indian SMEs is very low, and lower than that of large firms. A shortage of funds \nis  one  of  the  important  barriers  to  their  technological  competitiveness.  In  addition, \nSubrahmanya (2012) found that most Indian SMEs carried out incremental innovations \nthat  were  driven  by  customer  demands  and  confined  to  slight  changes  in  product \ndesign  and  shapes.  In  comparison,  a  study  by  Subhan  et  al.  (2014)  suggested  that \nPakistani  SMEs  need  to  invest  in  knowledge-based  resources  (e.g.,  R&D,  process \ninnovation) if they hope to improve their innovation performance. Further, Pakistan has \nnot yet developed an effective national system for improving R&D spending and other \ntechnological  investment,  especially  in  the  biotech  industry.  Moreover,  outdated \ntechnologies,  lack  of  access  to  credit,  high  interest  rates  on  lending,  and  the  lack  of \ngovernment  support  are  the  major  barriers  faced  by  Pakistani  SMEs  (Berry  1998). \nOverall, the facts related to Indian and Pakistani SMEs suggest that a low level of R&D \nactivity results in fewer innovations and that the lack of access to credit and the lack of \nan innovative culture are the major obstacles to innovation for SMEs.  \n\n3.2  Data Source \n\nThe  data  was  obtained  from  the World  Bank  Enterprise  database  for  2013  under  the \ntitle  of  \u201cThe  World  Bank  Innovation  Follow-Up.\u201d  This  survey  was  initially  launched  in \n2011 to investigate the innovation performance of developing countries. The innovation \ndata  was  available  for  both  countries  for  the  same  year.  The  survey  gathered \ninformation  on  the  key  innovation  variables  including  R&D,  product  and  process \ninnovation,  sources  of  financing  for  innovation,  and  aspects  of  organizational  and \nmarketing innovation. The survey covered 3,492 Indian firms and 696 from Pakistan. In \nboth  countries,  over  75%  of  firms  were  engaged  in  manufacturing  (textiles,  tobacco, \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 577 \n \n\nRehman \n\nchemicals,  printing,  electronics  and  machinery,  and  others)  and  over  15%  in  services \n(IT, wholesale trade, hotel and restaurants, transport, and others). \n\nThe majority of these firms surveyed were SMEs. This study uses dummy variables for \nfirm size. The definition followed the guidelines from the World Bank Enterprise Survey \ninstead of country-specific definitions. Small firms are defined as having 5\u201319 workers; \nmedium-sized  firms,  20\u201399  workers;  and  large  firms  100  workers  of  more.  In  India, \napproximately 28% are small firms, 45% are medium-sized, and nearly 27% are large. \nFor  Pakistan,  44%  are small firms,  35%  are medium-sized,  and  21%  are large.  Micro \nfirms with fewer than 5 workers were not used in the analysis. The data was gathered \nfrom  23  Indian  states  and  in  Pakistan  from  three  provinces\u2014Punjab  (54%  of  firms), \nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa (20.26%), and Sindh (13.36%)\u2014and the capital city of Islamabad \n(12.79%). \n\n3.3  A Comparison of Innovation Activities \n\nIndia  has  higher  internal  R&D  investment  than  Pakistan  in  plastics  and  rubber, \nmachinery,  chemicals,  electronics,  basic  metals,  and  other  sectors.  Alternatively, \nPakistani  firms  had  higher  R&D  than  India  in  food,  textiles,  chemicals,  vehicles,  retail \ntrade, and others. This indicates that the industries in the two countries are different in \nterms  of  undertaking  internal  R&D.  However,  in  both  countries  the  R&D  intensity  is \nhigher  in  manufacturing  than  in  services.  For  comparative  analysis,  figures  1  and  2 \nprovide the innovation activities of Indian and Pakistani SMEs. \n\nAs  shown  in  Figure  1,  approximately  46%  of  the  3,492  Indian  SMEs  surveyed \nundertook  internal  R&D  compared  with  just  over  9%  of  696  Pakistani  firms.  This \nsuggests  that  Pakistani  SMEs  are  much  less  engaged  in  internal  R&D.  The  level  of \nexternal  R&D  undertaking  is  very  low  in  both  countries,  suggesting  there  are  poor \nalliances or collaboration with other firms and research institutions. Further, most (65%) \nof  the  Indian  SMEs  were  engaged  in  product  innovation,  compared  with  only  22%  of \nPakistani  SMEs.  This  information  suggests  that  the  low  level  of  R&D  by  Pakistani \nenterprises  results  in  low  innovation  output.  A  similar  trend  is  found  for  process \ninnovation;  nearly  61%  of  Indian  SMEs  introduced  process  innovation  compared  with \n9% of Pakistani SMEs. However, the patent and license output is low in both countries. \nThis  outcome  could  indicate  that  SMEs  in  both  countries  predominantly  introduce \nincremental innovations. Overall, Figure 1 suggests that Indian SMEs are dominant in \nterms of carrying out internal R&D and product and process innovation compared with \nPakistani SMEs. \n\nSMEs in both countries rely mainly (over 70%) on internal sources of financing for their \ninnovation activities (Figure 1). Interestingly, nearly 59% of Indian SMEs also financed \ntheir  innovation  through  external  borrowing  from  banks,  but  only  10%  of  Pakistani \nSMEs  funded  their  innovation  in  this  way.  This  suggests  that  Pakistani  SMEs  have \nsubstantially  less  access  to  external  finance  than  Indian  SMEs.  Similarly,  public \nsupport for innovation activities (R&D grants, subsidies, and tax credits) is low in both \ncountries, albeit higher in India (8.0%) than in Pakistan (about 1.5%).  \n\nFigure 2 provides information on R&D and product and process innovation by firm size. \nApproximately  31%  of  small  firms  in  India  are  engaged  in  R&D  and  nearly  46%  of \nmedium-sized firms. A much higher share of large firms, 63%, are engaged in R&D. In \nPakistan, only 3% of small firms undertake R&D compared with 11% of medium-sized \nfirms and 20% of large firms. Overall, the link between R&D and firm size indicates that \nlarge firms in both countries undertake more R&D than do SMEs. The level of R&D by \nSMEs is lower in Pakistan than India. \n\n8 \n \n\n\f100 \n90 \n80 \n70 \n60 \n50 \n40 \n30 \n20 \n10 \n0 \n\n80 \n70 \n60 \n50 \n40 \n30 \n20 \n10 \n0 \n\nADBI Working Paper 577 \n \n\nRehman \n\nFigure 1: Innovation Activities in Indian and Pakistani Small  \nand Medium-Sized Enterprises (%)  \n\n65.15 \n\n60.15 \n\n46.19 \n\n22.17 \n\n9.34 \n\n9.25 \n\n6.03 \n\n9.05 \n\n6.3 \n\n2.3 \n\n93.9 \n\n72.75 \n\n58.73 \n\nIndia \n\nPakistan \n\n10.49 \n\n8.42 \n\n1.44 \n\n4.73 \n\n1 \n\n10.11 \n\n6.75 \n\nFigure 2: Research and Development and Product and Process Innovation  \nby Firm Size, India and Pakistan (%) \n\n63.16 \n\n54.99 \n\n62.87 \n\n63.41 \n\n68.31 \n\n59.41 \n\n71.24 \n\n45.56 \n\n30.69 \n\n18.25 \n\n28 \n\n11.06 \n\n3.14 \n\n8.01 \n\n8.41 \n\n26.47 \n\n20.29 \n\n13.04 \n\nSmall \n\nMedium \n\nLarge \n\nSmall \n\nMedium \n\nLarge \n\nIndia  \nResearch and Development \n\nProduct Innovation \n\nProcess Innovation \n\nPakistan \n\n \n\n \n\nIn  India,  63%  of  SMEs  have  introduced  product  innovations.  However,  71%  of  large \nIndian firms generated product innovations and 68% undertook process innovations. In \nPakistan, 18% of small firms have introduced product innovations compared with 28% \nof medium-sized firms and 26% of large firms. Process innovation is low at about 8%. \nLarge firms are more engaged in innovation activities in both countries, which suggests \nthey  have  better  financial  and  knowledge  resources.  Pakistani  SMEs  have  lower \ninnovation capabilities than those in India. \n\n3.4  Variables  \n\nThe  study  uses  two  dependent  variables,  product  innovation  and  process  innovation, \nwhich  are  the  key  outputs  of  R&D  and  related  activities  (Conte  and  Vivarelli  2013; \nFritsch  and  Meschede  2001;  Pellegrino  et  al.  2014).  Product  innovation  provides \nmarket  leadership,  broadens  a  firm\u2019s  customer  base,  and  increases  the  price  buyers \nare willing to pay, while process innovation reduces a firm\u2019s average cost of production \n(Wolff and Pett 2006; Cohen and Klepper 1996; De Jong and Vermeulan 2006). While \nsome studies (Hagedoorn and Cloodt 2003; Katila 2000; Liu 2009) used patent counts \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 577 \n \n\nRehman \n\nand  applications  as  a  proxy  for  innovation  output,  this  study  prefers  product  and \nprocess innovation over patents as dependent variables for several reasons. First, it is \nnot necessary that every innovation is patented; and second, many firms do not patent \nbecause of their reluctance to disclose information and secrecy can help to protect their \ninnovations.  Moreover,  in  developing  countries  patent  usage  is  not  very common  due \nto financial constraints and the low quality of innovations (Ghoneim 2003). \n\nThe  major  independent  variables  of  interest  of  this  study  are  internal  and  external  \nR&D.  Two  additional  innovation  input  variables  that  are  used  are  internal  technology \nacquisition  (investment \nin  machinery,  equipment,  and  software)  and  external \ntechnology acquisition (patents and licenses), which generally have a significant impact \non firms\u2019 innovation performance (Silva et al. 2012; Crespi and Zuniga 2012). The other \nindependent  variables  relate  to  firms\u2019  financial  resources  measured  as  internal  funds, \nexternal  bank  finance,  and  public  support  (R&D  subsidies  and  tax  incentives).  These \nthree explanatory variables investigate the impact of different types of finance on firms\u2019 \ninnovation output. Finally, firm size and age are added as control variables, the former \nas a dummy variable and the latter in logarithmic form. \n\n4.  ECONOMETRIC MODEL \n\n4.1  Model Specification \n\nA bivariate probit model is used to estimate the relationship between R&D and product \nand  process  innovations.  This  estimation  method  removes  the  sample  selection  bias \nand  also  presents  more  accurate  parameters  through  the  inclusion  of  non-innovative \nfirms  (Chun  and  Mun  2012).  Alternatively,  Heckman  (1979)  suggested  a  correction \nprocedure  (i.e.,  Heckit  procedure)  for  sample  selection  bias  by  using  continuous \ndependent  variables.  However, \nthe  dependent  variables  are \npredominantly  discrete  and  the  use  of  the  inverse  Mills  ratio  is  not  an  appropriate \nchoice.  Moreover,  the  correlation  coefficient  between  the  two  unobserved  factors \n(residuals)  from  the  two  equations  indicates  the  possible  complementarities  between \nthe dependent variables.

The  results \nsuggest  that  firms  undertaking  internal  R&D  increase  the  probability  of  product \ninnovation  by  37%  and  process  innovation  by  21%.  This  outcome  confirms  our  initial \nhypothesis  and  is  in  line  with  similar  results  from  Stam  and  Wennberg  (2009)  and \nGallie and Legros (2012). However, no statistical relationship is found between external \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 577 \n \n\nRehman \n\nR&D and process innovation. One possibility for the latter result is that R&D might not \nbe required for process innovation.  This apparently suggests that undertaking external \nR&D  is  costly  for  Indian  SMEs  with  regard  to  process  innovation.  The  coefficients  of \ntechnological acquisition show positive association to product innovation and to some \nextent  process  innovation  as  well.  Thus,  firms\u2019  decision  to  spend  on  machinery, \nequipment, licensing, and software generate innovation (Table 2). This result is similar \nto that of Silva et al.

This \nsuggests that younger firms are more likely to generate product innovation than older \nfirms.  Firm  size  categories  of  small  and  medium  present  a  negative  relationship  \nwith product and process innovation,2 which suggests that smaller firms are less likely  \nto  engage  in  innovation  than  large  ones.

First, large firms caused \nmulticollinearity with other size bands. Second, this study specifically focuses on the analysis of SMEs. \nHowever, in the following models firm\u2019s size also used as continuous variable for comparison between \nsmall and large firms. \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 577 \n \n\nRehman \n\nhypothesis that small firms are less innovative because of low economies of scale and \nweak  access  to  skills  and  financial  resources  (Conte  and  Vivarelli  2013;  Love  and \nRoper  1999).  Further,  the  parameter  of  external finance  shows  a  positive  relationship \nwith process innovation. However, no statistical link is found between external finance \nand product innovation.  \n\nPublic  support for  innovation  activities  through R&D  grants,  subsidies, and  tax  credits \nhas  a  positive  and  significant  impact  on  product  innovation  but  not  on  process \ninnovation.  This  result  confirms  the  similar  finding  of  Hottenrott  and  Lopes-Bento \n(2012). Lastly, the manufacturing sector is more likely to introduce product innovation. \n\nTable 3: Bivariate Probit Estimation Analysis, Pakistan \n\nProduct Innovation \n\nProcess Innovation \n\nZ-value \n0.45 \n\nZ-value \n\u20130.20 \n\nExplanatory Variable \n\nInternal R&D \n\nExternal R&D \n\nTechnology aquisition-1 \n\nTechnology acquisition-2 \n\nLog age \n\nSmall firms \n\nMedium firms \n\nInternal finance \n\nExternal finance \n\nPublic support \n\nSector \n\nConstant \n\nRho (\u03c1) \n\nCoefficient \n0.1154 \n(0.2574) \n0.1015c \n(0.0572) \n0.3395b \n(0.1593) \n0.6580* \n(0.4109) \n0.4957a \n(0.1104) \n0.0359 \n(0.1704) \n0.3037* \n(0.1670) \n0.8947a \n(0.1749) \n\u20130.1996 \n(0.2055) \n0.3141 \n(0.4828) \n0.4040b \n(0.1982) \n\u20133.3600a \n(0.4748) \n0.6107a \n(0.0721) \n\n121.24a \n\nCoefficient \n\u20130.0664 \n(0.3366) \n0.4433b \n(0.1663) \n1.0154a \n(0.1749) \n0.3973 \n(0.3552) \n0.1954 \n(0.1267) \n\u20130.0546 \n(0.2187) \n\u20130.1721 \n(0.2091) \n0.6304a \n(0.2057) \n0.1062 \n(0.225) \n0.0390 \n(0.5459) \n0.2886 \n(0.2501) \n\u20132.8609a \n(0.5308) \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n2.66 \n\n5.80 \n\n1.12 \n\n1.54 \n\n\u20130.25 \n\n\u20130.82 \n\n3.06 \n\n0.48 \n\n0.07 \n\n1.15 \n\n\u20135.39 \n\n1.77 \n\n2.13 \n\n1.60 \n\n4.49 \n\n0.21 \n\n1.82 \n\n5.11 \n\n\u20130.97 \n\n0.65 \n\n7.04 \n\n\u20137.08 \n\n8.47 \n\n\u2013 \n\nWald Chi-square \n\na = p<0.01; b = p<0.05; c = p<0.10. \n\nRobust standard errors are in parentheses. \n\nN = 648. \n\nTable 3 shows the results for Pakistan. Surprisingly, internal R&D shows no statistical \nassociation  with  innovation  and  therefore  rejects  the  initial  hypothesis.  There  are  \ntwo  possible  explanations  for  this  outcome.  First,  Pakistani  SMEs  do  not  undertake \ninternal R&D because it is costly and risky. Second, Pakistani SMEs may not have the  \nR&D-related capabilities (workforce skills) to conduct internal R&D. In contrast, external \nR&D  does  increase  the  probability  of  introducing  product  innovation  by  10%  (it  was \n21% for India).  External R&D  showed  a  strong  association (nearly  44%) with  process \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 577 \n \n\nRehman \n\ninnovation (higher than India). This result suggests that Pakistani SMEs may overcome \nthe  high  costs  and  risks  and  skill-related  problems  through  R&D  alliances.  However, \nthis effect is stronger for process innovation than for product innovation. \n\nTechnological acquisition has a positive and significant impact on product and process \ninnovation,  which  is  in  line  with  the  findings  of  Crespi  and  Zuniga  (2012).  The \ncoefficient  of  age  shows  a  positive  association  with  product  innovation,  implying  that \nolder firms are more likely to introduce product innovation. Concerning the relationship \nbetween  firm  size  and  innovation,  medium-sized  firms  show  a  positive  association  \nto  product  innovation.  No  relationship  is  found  between  firm\u2019s  size  and  process \ninnovation.  Regarding  internal  sources  of  financing  for  innovation  activities,  internal \nfinance  is  positively  correlated  with  product  innovation  but  it  is  not  significant.  For \nprocess  innovation,  the  sign  is  negative  and  the  variable  is  also  insignificant.  The \nparameter  of  external  finance  is  also  insignificant  and  may  indicate  that  Pakistani \nSMEs are more externally constrained than Indian SMEs. The manufacturing sector is \nmore likely to introduce product innovations than the services sector. \n\n4.2.2   Productivity and Innovation \n\nA  number  of  researchers  have  found  that  innovation  has  a  positive  impact  on \nproductivity  (Masso  and  Vahter  2011;  Cassiman  and  Golovko  2007).  These  studies \nidentified  an  endogenous  relationship  between  innovation  and  productivity,  although \nthat  endogeneity  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  study.  Figures  3\u20136  compare  the  labor \nproductivity  of  innovators  to  non-innovators  for  India  and  Pakistan.3 For  Indian  firms \nthat are product innovators (Figure 3), the labor productivity distribution coincides with \nthat  of  non-product  innovators.  For  Pakistan,  the  productivity  of  product  innovators \nexceeds that of non-product innovators (Figure 5).  \n\nFigure 3: Productivity Difference by Product Innovation (India) \n\n \n \n                                                \n3   Labor  productivity  is  defined  as  a  firm\u2019s  total  sales  divided  by  the  number  of  employees.  Labor \nproductivity is  logged.  Further,  OLS  regression  has been  used  to  investigate  the  relationship  between \nproductivity  and  innovation.  However,  a  low  R-square  value  (<0.05)  and  nonsignificant  coefficients \nsuggest that the use of the OLS method is not an appropriate choice.  \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 577 \n \n\nRehman \n\nFigure 4: Productivity Difference by Process Innovation (India) \n\nFigure 5: Productivity Difference by Product Innovation (Pakistan) \n\n \n\n \n\nLabor  productivity  distribution  for  process  innovators  is  coincided  with  non-process \ninnovators  for  both  India  and  Pakistan  (see  Figures  4  and  6).  However,  in  Pakistan,  \nthe  labor  productivity  distribution  of  process  and  non-process  innovators  is  similar \n(Figure 6).  The  lack  of  information  on  other  variables  (e.g.,  materials,  capital \ninvestment) has prevented the use of total factor productivity, which is a better indicator \nof productivity. Overall, these figures suggest that the productivity of product innovators \nhas  stochastic  dominance  over  process  innovators  in  Pakistan,  while  Indian  firms \nshowed no stochastic dominance for process innovators.  \n\n \n\n \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 577 \n \n\nRehman \n\nFigure 6: Productivity Difference by Process Innovation (Pakistan) \n\n \n\nTable 4: Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov Test for Equality of Distribution Function \n\nInnovation \n\nProduct innovation (India) \nProcess innovation (India) \nProduct innovation (Pakistan) \nProcess innovation (Pakistan) \na Indicates null hypothesis rejected at 10% significance level. \n\nLabor Productivity (Yes = 1) \n0.0293 \n0.0198 \n0.1209a \n0.1078 \n\nLabor Productivity (No = 0) \n\u20130.0115 \n\u20130.0351 \n\u20130.0158 \n\u20130.0708 \n\nResults  of  the  Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov  test  for  equality  of  distribution  are  provided  in \nTable  4,  which  compares  the  labor  productivity  distribution  of  product  and  process \ninnovators  for  the  two  countries.  In  the  case  of  Pakistan,  the  labor  productivity  of \nproduct  innovators  stochastically  dominates  the  non-product  innovators  and  the  null \nhypothesis of no productivity difference is rejected. This implies that product innovators \ntend to be more productive than non-product innovators only for Pakistani SMEs.  \n\n4.2.3   Complementary Relationship between Internal and External R&D \n\nTo  estimate  the  final  hypothesis  on  the  complementary  relationship  between  internal \nand  external  R&D,  separate  probit  models  have  been  estimated  (Table  4).  Several \nresearchers have used R&D as the dependent variable (Pradhan 2011; Ornaghi 2006; \nPiga and Vivarelli 2004; Becker and Dietz 2004). Specifically, Piga and Vivarelli (2004) \nfound  that  internal  and  external  R&D  are  potentially  endogenous.  Internal  R&D  is \ncorrelated  with  the  error  term  in  the  external  R&D  equation.  In  order  to  avoid  this \nendogeneity problem, this study has used separate probit models for each dependent \nvariable (internal and external R&D). This follows the method used by Becker and Dietz \n(2004)  to  estimate  the  complementarity  between  internal  and  external  R&D.  In  the \ncurrent study, internal R&D and external R&D are both discrete variables so the choice \nof  a  probit  model  is  appropriate.  In  addition,  firm  size  is  introduced  as  a  continuous \nvariable (in logarithmic form) for two reasons. First, several researchers have used firm \nsize  as  a  continuous  variable  to  avoid  the  possible  multicollinearity  between  firm  size \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 577 \n \n\nRehman \n\ncategories (e.g., Demirbas et al. 2011). Second, using the sign of the coefficient of firm \nsize as a continuous variable allows for the comparison between small and large firms. \n\nTable 5 reports the results of the probit estimations for India and Pakistan. The link test \nis used to see whether the model is adequately satisfied without omitted variable bias. \nThe variable prediction squared has accepted the null hypothesis which shows that the \nmodel  is  correctly  specified  (Table  4).4 In  the  first  model,  a  1%  increase  in  external \nR&D  raises  the  probability  of  internal  R&D  by  53%.  Similarly,  in  the  second,  internal \nR&D has a positive and significant impact on external R&D. In both specifications, the \nparameters  for  internal  and  external  R&D  are  highly  significant  (at  the  \u03c1<0.01  level). \nThis outcome  indicates the  complementary  relationship  between  internal and  external \nR&D.  External  R&D  motivates  firms  to  undertake  more  internal  R&D  and  expand  the \nfirms\u2019  technological  capabilities.  This  result  is  in  line  with  the  findings  of  Ceccagnoli  \net  al.  (2013)  and  Becker  and  Dietz  (2004)  and  confirms  the  prior  expectation  of  their \ncomplementary relationship.  \n\nTable 5: Probit Model Estimation (Maximum Likelihood Method) \n\nIndia \n\nInternal R&D (Model 1) \nCoefficient \n\u2013 \n\nZ-value \n\u2013 \n\nExternal R&D (Model 2) \nZ-value \nCoefficient \n0.4606a \n6.79 \n(0.0678) \n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\nExplanatory Variables \n\nInternal R&D \n\nExternal R&D \n\nTechnology aquisition-1 \n\nTechnology acquisition-2 \n\nLog age \n\nLog size \n\nInternal finance \n\nExternal finance \n\nPublic support \n\nSector \n\nConstant \n\n \n\nPseudo \nModel Specification Test \nPredict hat \nPredict hat\u2013square \n\n\ud835\udc79\n\n\ud835\udfd0\n\n\u20130.0549 \n(0.0689) \n0.2849a \n(0.1069) \n\u20130.0458 \n(0.0413) \n0.2208a \n(0.0805) \n\u20130.0370 \n(0.1278) \n0.1742a \n(0.0637) \n0.0602 \n(0.1069) \n0.0727 \n(0.0811) \n\u20131.4454a \n(0.1921) \n\n \n\n0.8241 \n\u20130.0669 \n\n\u20130.80 \n\n2.66 \n\n\u20131.11 \n\n2.74 \n\n\u20130.29 \n\n2.73 \n\n0.57 \n\n0.90 \n\n\u20137.52 \n\n \n0.91 \n\u20130.19 \n\n6.51 \n\n10.45 \n\n3.49 \n\n0.88 \n\n11.61 \n\n4.55 \n\n0.42 \n\n\u20131.43 \n\n9.45 \n\n\u20137.11 \n\n \n21.19 \n0.10 \n\n0.5399a \n(0.0829) \n0.5013a \n(0.0479) \n0.3281a \n(0.0940) \n0.0268 \n(0.0305) \n0.2571a \n(0.0221) \n0.4283a \n(0.0942) \n0.0194 \n(0.0464) \n\u20130.1188 \n(0.0833) \n0.5440a \n(0.0575) \n\u20131.0096a \n(0.1420) \n\n \n1.0015a \n0.0068 \n\n17 \n \n\n0.1148 \n\n0.0468 \n\n                                                \n4   A link test uses the prediction square of the model and if the prediction square does have explanatory \npower (i.e., the coefficient has significant value), it means that the model is incorrectly specified.

This  outcome  indicates  that  firms\u2019  innovation \nexpenditure is likely to increase the probability of undertaking internal R&D. However, \nin  model  2  only  one  form  of  technology  acquisition  shows  a  positive  association  to \nexternal  R&D.  Overall,  firm  size  shows  a  positive  relationship  with  both  internal  and \nexternal  R&D.  This  outcome  suggests  Indian  and  Pakistani  SMEs  are  less  likely  \nto  engage  in  R&D  than  large  firms.  This  finding  accords  with  the  Schumpeterian  \nnotion that large firms are more innovative than small firms due to their economies of \nscale advantage. \n\nSimilarly,  a  positive  relationship  is  found  between  internal  and  external  R&D  for \nPakistan (Table 5). The relationship is much stronger for Pakistani firms than for those \nin India. Overall, the outcomes between internal and external R&D in Table 4 suggest \nthat both variables have a complementary relationship. Increasing internal (or external) \nR&D by a factor of 1 increases the probability of increasing external (or internal) R&D \nby  a  similar  magnitude.  Furthermore,  technology  acquisition  increases  the  probability  \nof  engaging  in  internal  R&D.  However,  only  model  4  shows  a  positive  relationship \nbetween firm size and undertaking external R&D. This outcome implies that large firms \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 577 \n \n\nRehman \n\nare  more  likely  to  undertake  external  R&D.  The  coefficient  of  internal  finance  shows \nthat  a  1%  increase  in  internal  finance  is  likely  to  raise  internal  R&D  by  85%.  This \nindicates that the majority of Pakistani SMEs rely on internal sources of finance for their \ninnovation activities. Lastly, public support to innovation activities (e.g., R&D subsidies \nand grants) is likely to raise external R&D.  \n\n5.  CONCLUSION \n\nThis study indicates that Indian SMEs undertake more  internal and external R&D and \nintroduce more product and process innovations than Pakistani SMEs. However, SMEs \nin  both  the  countries  exhibit  weak  R&D  collaboration  with  other  firms  or  research \ninstitutions.  Moreover,  SMEs  were  mainly  engaged  in  incremental  innovations  due  to \nthe low level of patent protection. Similarly, public support for innovation activities in the \nform  of  R&D  grants,  subsidies,  or  tax  credits  are  low  for  SMEs  in  both  the  countries. \nFurthermore,  Pakistani  SMEs  are  more  constrained  in  terms  of  access  to  external \nfinance than those in India. The majority of Pakistani SMEs relied on internal source of \nfinancing for  innovation  output (product/process).  However,  internal financing  was  not \nsufficient  to  undertake  internal  and  external  R&D.  In  comparison,  Indian  SMEs  used \nboth  internal  and  external  financing  for  accelerating  their  innovation  output  and  were \nfound marginally better in terms of undertaking R&D.  \n\nRegarding  the  estimation  results,  this  paper  reveals  that  SMEs  engaged  in  both \ninternal  and  external  R&D  may  have  significantly  better  innovation  performance.  This \noutcome was found stronger for Indian SMEs because Pakistani SMEs are reluctant to \nundertake  internal  R&D  due  to  the  high  costs  and  risks  associated  with  innovation \nefforts.  Overall,  the  negative  relationship  between  firm  size  and  innovation  output \nsuggests that  SMEs  in  both  countries may  be facing resource  constraints. This  result \nsupports  the  finding  of  Schumpeter  (1942)  that  small  firms  are  less  innovative\u2014they \nhave  lower  levels  of  R&D,  are  less  capital  intensive,  and  are  more  risk  averse  than \nlarge  firms.  In  addition,  the  positive  relationship  between  internal  and  external  R&D \nimplies a complementary relationship between these two types of R&D. This suggests \nthe  likelihood  that  investing  in  internal  R&D  would  increase  the  probability  of  \nalso  engaging  in  external  R&D,  and  vice  versa.  This  result  confirms  the  findings  of \nother researchers. \n\nThe  study  provides  important  policy  implications.  First,  the  relationship  between \nexternal  R&D  and  innovation  output  indicates  that  small  firms  in  both  the  countries \nrequire linkages with other firms and research institutions. Network relations are a good \nsource  for  gaining  complementary  skills  and  absorptive  capacity.  Pakistani  SMEs  are \nat a specific disadvantage in terms of investment in internal and external R&D, and the \nlack of an R&D culture reduces firms\u2019 innovation performance. Policy instruments such \nas  R&D  grants  from  government  agencies  are  more  beneficial  in  increasing  R&D \ninvestment and innovation output than R&D financing. It is difficult for SMEs to obtain \nR&D  financing  due  to  its  risky  nature (i.e.,  research  can take  a  long  time  to generate \nresults).  Overall,  the  negative  relationship  between  firm  size  and  innovation  output \nsuggests that SMEs face resource constraints.  \n\nThe  results  imply  that  specific  policy  measures  might  be  provided  through  such \ninstitutions  as  the  Small  Industries  Development  Bank  of  India,  other  state  financial \ninstitutions  in  India,  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  Development  Authority  of \nPakistan,  and  banks  serving  SMEs  in  Pakistan  to  remove  the  barriers  to  improving \nSMEs\u2019  innovation  performance.  In  addition,  such  instruments  as  R&D  grants  and \nsubsidies,  a  stronger  R&D  culture,  the  availability  of  external  finance  requiring  less \n\n19 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 577 \n \n\nRehman \n\ncollateral,  and  university\u2013industry  linkages  may  encourage  SMEs  to  improve  their \ninnovation performance. The complementary relationship between internal and external \nR&D  implies  that  business  managers  can  utilize  a  balanced  combination  of  R&D  to \nincrease innovation performance. \n\nlimitations.  The  unavailability  of \n\nThis  study  has  several \ninformation  on  R&D \nexpenditure,  technological  acquisition  expenditure,  and  borrowing  for  Pakistani  SMEs \nrequired  the  use  of  less  precise  dummy  variables.  Further,  longitudinal  data  would \nhave  captured  the  effects  of  R&D  more  appropriately  than  cross-sectional  data,  as \nR&D  is  most  often  a  long-term  investment.  A  lower  number  of  observations  for \nPakistan than for India also affected the accuracy of the estimates. The study can be \nextended  to  other  South  Asian  countries  to  broaden  the  analysis  of  the  innovation \nperformance of SMEs. \n\n \n\n \n\n20 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 577 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nRehman \n\nAbor, J., and N.

Micro-level data was obtained for 3,492 Indian and 696 Pakistani SMEs \nfrom  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Enterprise  Survey,  and  bivariate  probit  estimation  techniques  were \nused. The results show that internal and external R&D positively affects product and process \ninnovations.  However,  this  effect  is  stronger  for  Indian  SMEs.  The  negative  relationship \nbetween firm size and innovation output implies that SMEs in both countries face resource \nconstraints.  Further,  Indian  SMEs  are  dominant  in  terms  of  undertaking  internal  R&D  \nand  generating  product  and  process  innovations  relative  to  those  in  Pakistan.  The \ncomplementary  relationship  between  internal  and  external  R&D  has  been  examined  for  \nboth  countries.  The  study  is  unique  in  comparing  Indian  and  Pakistani  SMEs  innovation \nactivities  using  micro-level  data.  The  results  suggest  that  business  managers  can  utilize  a \nbalanced  combination  of  internal  and  external  R&D  to  accelerate  innovation  output  and \nincrease absorptive capacity. Specifically, public support for innovation, such as R&D grants, \nsubsidies, and tax credits, could encourage SMEs to undertake more radical innovations. \n \nJEL Classification: D22, L25, O31, O32 \n", " \n"]}
