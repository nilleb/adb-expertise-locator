In stage 1, \noutsourcing  firms  in  the  North  (e.g.,  United  States  [US]  and  Europe\uff09cause  environmental \ndamage  to  the  vendor  country  in  the  South,  as  exemplified  by  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina (PRC). But, as its primary goal, the South pursuing economic development  is willing  \nto  bear  the  costs  of  environmental  degradation.  Moving  into  Stage  II,  the  environmental \ndeterioration  becomes  so  severe  in  the  South  that  the  vendor  country  begins  to  tackle  the \nenvironmental  problem  by  enacting  government  regulations.  As  a  result,  the  costs  and, \nhence,  the  prices  of  outsourced  goods  and  services  tend  to  increase  for  the  firms  in  the \nNorth.  However,  the  environmental  protection  measures  undertaken  generally  fall  short  of \nthe  levels  needed  to  restore  the  environmental  quality  acceptable  by  WHO  standards.  We \npresent  a  framework  for  analyzing  the  effects  of  international  outsourcing  on  environment \nand, ultimately, social welfare in terms of gains and losses under three alternative scenarios \nregarding  no,  partial  or  full  accountability  for  outsourcing  induced  environmental  damages. \nThe  policy  implication  is  clear:  to  fully  resolve  the  environmental  problem  in  Stage  III,  the \nimplementation  of  strong  regulations  or  the  fostering  international  cooperation  is  desirable; \nthat is, until the environmental costs of outsourcing are fully accounted for by the outsourcing \nfirms  in  the  North.  Such  firms,  however,  may  react  by  resorting  to  insourcing,  diversified \noutsourcing and other strategies. \n \nKeywords: outsourcing, labor-augmenting effect, environmental costs, internalization, \nvendor countries \n \nJEL Classification: F11, F13, F22 \n \n\n \n\n\fChoi and Yu \n\nADBI Working Paper 848 \n \n\nContents \n \n \n1. \n\nINTRODUCTION ......................................................................................................... 1 \n\nASSUMPTIONS AND THE MODEL ............................................................................ 3 \n\nOUTSOURCING, ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS, INTERNALIZATION,  \nAND WELFARE .......................................................................................................... 6 \n\n4. \n\nCONCLUSIONS ........................................................................................................ 11 \n\nREFERENCES ..................................................................................................................... 12 \n\nAPPENDIX ............................................................................................................................ 14 \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 848 \n \n\n1.  INTRODUCTION \n\nChoi and Yu \n\nIn  recent  decades,  amid  the  increasing  trend  of  globalization  resulting  from  the  rapid \nadvancement  in  communication  and  transportation  technology,  the  outsourcing  of \nintermediate  and/or  finished  goods  or  services  to  firms  in  foreign  countries  for  the \npurposes  of  lowering  production  costs  and  increasing  production  efficiency  has \nbecome  prevalent  in  world  trade.  For  example,  client  firms  in  developed  countries  in \nthe North (i.e., the US and EU), while maintaining management bases and conducting \nresearch  and  development  (R&D)  at  home,  shift  their  manufacturing  activities  to \ndeveloping  countries  in  the  South  where  labor  costs  are  lower  (e.g.,  the  PRC,  India, \nMalaysia,  Philippines,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam)  and/or  buy  a  substantial  amount  of \nparts or services from local Southern firms.  \n\nIt  is  noteworthy  that,  while  the  focus  on  international  outsourcing  (also  known  as \n\u201coffshoring  or  fragmentation\u201d)  has  been  mainly  placed  on  North-South  outsourcing,  a \nfirm\u2019s  decision  to  outsource  can  actually  be  driven  by  a  variety  of  factors,  including  \n(but not limited to) the  lowering of  labor costs. Such factors can be related to capital, \ntechnology  and  organizational  competency.  The  paramount  aim  is  to  enhance  the \noperational capability and profitability of the firm\u2019s production. To illustrate, both the US \nand EU countries outsource products from each other. The PRC outsources a variety \nof  intermediate  goods  (such  as  crude  petroleum,  integrated  circuit  and  iron  ore)  from \nAustralia;  Germany;  Hong  Kong,  China;  Japan;  and  the  Republic  of  Korea  among \nothers, while itself shifting  the outsourcing  of goods (of garments, apparels, toys, foot \nwares, and tools) to other developing countries in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. The \nevolution of these outsourcing patterns over recent years reveals two important facts: \n(a)  outsourcing  can  occur  universally  among  countries;  whereby,  it  can  be  of  any \ndirection (i.e., from North to South, from North to North, from South to North, and from \nSouth to South); (b) each time goods and services are imported, the importing country \nhas  possibly  outsourced  a  portion  of  economic  activity  from  abroad  \u2013  that  is,  all \ninternational trade is likely to involve some outsourcing of intermediate inputs.  \n\nConsequently,  international  outsourcing  has  become  a  major  topic  for  the  study  of \ninternational  trade  and  stimulated  a  spate  of  intellectual  contributions to  the  literature \nfrom  economists  in  the  field.  (e.g.,  Chao  and  Yu  1993;  Bhagwati,  Panagariya,  and \nSrinivasan  2004;  Kohler  2004;  Long  2005;  G\u00f6rg  and  Hanley  2005;  Jones  2005). 1 \nAmong  the  rich  and  still  growing  body  of  literature  studying  various  aspects  of \ninternational outsourcing are the two notable works, both of which use the Neoclassical \nHeckscher-Ohin  (HO  henceforth)  general  equilibrium  framework:  one  by  Bhagwati, \nPanagariya, and Srinivasan (2004, BPS henceforth) and the other by Batra and Beladi \n(2010,  BB  henceforth).  In  the  former,  BPS  (2004)  argue  that  trade  opportunity \nincreases  as  a  result  of  advances  in  information  technology,  which  converts  the \ntraditional  non-tradable  service  into  a  so-called  Mode  1  service.  Analytically  this  is \nequivalent  to  a  growth  agent.  Further,  BPS  (2004),  without  formally  integrating \noutsourcing into the Neoclassical growth model, examined the terms of trade and the \nwelfare effects of outsourcing.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1   Other recent studies on the subject of outsourcing include Feenstra (1998), Deardorff (2001), Egger and \nEgger  (2003),  Grossman  and  Rossi-Hansberg  (2006),  Helpman,  Melitz  and  Yeaple  (2004),  Jones, \nKierzkowski and Lurong (2005), among others. \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 848 \n \n\nChoi and Yu \n\nLater, BB (2010), inspired by Mankiw\u2019s argument for offshoring, explored several major \nproperties  of  outsourcing,  particularly  the  welfare  effect  of  international  trade,  by \nincorporating a labor-augmenting feature of outsourcing into the HO model of general \nequilibrium.2 Here, it is worthwhile to note that: (a) BPS\u2019 (2004) argument for the growth \neffect of outsourcing is confined to the case of a Mode 1 service type of outsourcing, \nwhich  anticipates  BB\u2019s  (2010)  study  of  the  labor-augmenting  effect  of  outsourcing;  \n(b)  both  BPS  (2004)  and  BB  (2010)  do  not  expound  the  equivalency  of  the  effects of \nvarious  types  of  outsourcing  on  economic  growth.  More  recently,  Choi  and  Beladi \n(2012)  extended  BB\u2019s  work  (2010)  by  exploring  the  internal  and  external  gains  for  a \nsmall outsourcing country in the presence of variable returns to scale (VRS).3  \n\nOver  recent  decades,  the  dramatic  expansion of  outsourcing  by  Northern  firms  to  the \nSouth has inflicted massive damage upon the once fertile air and soil of the South.  A \nmarked  example  is  the  case  of  the  PRC,  the  so  called  \u201cWorld  Factory,\u201d  where  the \nproduction of myriad of outsourced goods and services (i.e., garments, apparels, toys, \nfoot  wares,  tools,  light  machineries,  electronics,  and  information-technology products) \nhas contaminated the air, water, and soil, depleted labor and material pools, triggered \ndeforestation/desertification  and  global  warming,  and  (more  seriously)  endangered  public \nhealth.  However,  the  vendor  countries  in  the  South  are  mostly  developing  countries \nwhose  primary  goal  is  economic  development.  Hence,  despite  the  environmental \ndamage,  they  opt  (in  their  early  period  of  international  offshoring)  to  provide  a \nhospitable business environment to Northern outsourcing firms.  \n\nBut,  as  outsourcing  activities  expanded,  the  environmental  costs  resulting  thereof \nbecame  too  heavy  for  the  vendor  countries  to  bear.  Therefore,  as  beginning  about  a \ndecade and half  ago, major vendor countries (notably the PRC) have begun  to  account  \nfor  or  internalize  the  environmental  costs  of  outsourcing  by  enacting  environmental \nregulations and taxes. This policy shift increases the prices of their outsourced goods \nand  services  to  firms  in  the  North.  However,  the  extent  of  such  a  move  is  still \nconsiderably  below  the  level  necessary  to  bring  the  South  back  to  an  acceptable \nenvironmental quality, as specified by the WHO standard.

To quote from a few recent reports by mass media:4 \n\n\u201cThe cost of environmental degradation in [the People\u2019s Republic of] China was about  \n$230 billion in 2010, or 3.5% of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product\u2014three times that \nin 2004, in local currency terms.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe  acidic  deposition  damages  buildings,  degrades  the  environment  and \nreduces crop yields.

Firms  have  resorted  to  vendor-country  diversification,  partial \noutsourcing,  insourcing,  or  resourcing.  Since  the  mid-1990s,  there  have  been \nnumerous reports about the changing patterns of outsourcing by Northern firms.5 \n\nThe  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  investigate  the  welfare  consequences  via  the \nenvironmental  impact  of  international  outsourcing  in  a  three-stage  model  of  North-\nSouth trade. In stage I, the outsourcing firms of the North inflict environmental damage \nupon the vendor country in the South, but the South (pursuing economic development \nas  its  primary  objective)  is  willing  to  bear  the  burden  of  environmental  spillovers.  In \nstage  II,  when  the  environmental  damages  become  substantial,  the  vendor  country \nbegins  to  internalize  the  environmental  costs  by  enacting  regulations.  However,  the \nregulations  in  Stage  II  and  the  resulting  increase  in  the  price  (level)  of  outsourced \ngoods  and  services  are  far  below  the  level  that  can  bring  the  Southern  environment \nback to the internationally acceptable level. This paper assesses the gains and losses \nof the South as caused by outsourcing from the North, explicitly expounding upon the \nenvironmental costs to the South. The policy implication of our finding is clear: Further \nenvironmental regulations by the South and/or international collaboration are required \nto fully account for the environmental costs to the South, as in stage III. \n\n2.  ASSUMPTIONS AND THE MODEL \n\nWe deploy a three-stage 2x2 model to depict an outsourcing country in the North, which \nhas two sectors under perfect competition: sector 1 producing good 1 in the amount of \nX1,  and sector 2 producing good 2 in the amount X2.  Each sector utilizes two factors, \nlabor (L) and capital (K) that are fixed in supply and perfectly mobile between the two \nsectors.  Flexible  wage  and  rental  ensure  the  full-employment  of  labor  (L)  and  capital \n(K). Since non-constant returns to scale can obscure the cost effect of outsourcing, the \npresent  analysis  is  confined  to  a  constant  returns  to  scale  (CRS)  case.  Further,  it  is \nassumed  that,  for  mutual  benefits,  the  outsourcing  firms  and  the  foreign  vendor  firms \nshare  technologies  in  producing  the  outsourced  goods  and  services.  The  factor \naugmenting  effects  of  outsourcing  differ  depending  on  the  direction  and  type  of  the \noutsourcing. However, this paper will focus on the labor-augmenting case because (a) \nit  is  the  major  reason  behind  the  North-South  trade  causing  the  environmental \nproblems in the South, and (b) once its effects are identified, the effects of other types \nof  factor-augmenting  outsourcing  can  be  similarly  deduced.  In  the  presence  of  the \nlabor-augmenting effect of outsourcing, the production functions of the two sectors can \nbe written as \n\niX = \n\nF A L K   \n,\ni\n\n(\n\n)\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni = 1, 2 \n\n(1) \n\niL  and \n\niK  are  the  labor  and  capital  employed  by  sector  i, \n\niF  is  linearly \nwhere \niA  is  a  \nhomogeneous  in  its  inputs  and  subject  to  the  law  of  diminishing  returns, \nlabor-augmenting  factor  derived  from  the  outsourced  goods  and  services  in  sector  i, \niL  is  the  effective  quantity  of  labor  services  supplied  by  the  outsourcing \nand  (\niA  is initially equal to unity in the absence \nactivity.

Therefore, \nthe  actual  price  of  the  labor-augmenting  factor  (Ai)  in  this  stage  does  not  include  the \nenvironmental  cost.  However,  moving  into  stage  II,  when  the  environmental  damage \nbecome significant, the vendor country begins to internalize the environmental costs by \nenacting  regulations.  Consequentially,  vender  firms  begin  to  raise  the  prices  of \n*\nib  respectively denote \noutsourced goods and services due to higher costs. Let bi and \nthe  actual  price  (reflecting  the  marginal  cost)  level  of  the  outsourced  goods  and \nservices  (Ai)  in  terms  of  good  2  in  stage  I  and  stage  II.

Then \ngraphically  as  the  upward  shift  in  the  perfectly  elastic  supply  curve  of  Ai  to  the \noutsourcing firms resulting from the regulatory measures of the environmental costs in \nstage  II.  Since  the  firms  engage  in  outsourcing  mainly  to  lower  their  costs  of \nproduction, we postulate,  \n\nib  (\n\nAi= 1, if ai \u2264 bi in stage I (or if ai \u2264 *\n\nib  in stage II) for all levels of Ai \n\nand Ai > 1  if ai > bi in stage I (or if ai > \n\n*\nib  in stage II) for some levels of  Ai. \n\n(2) \n\nIn another words, if ai \u2264 bi in stage I (or if ai \u2264 *\nib  in stage II) for all levels of Ai, there is \n*\nib in \nno  outsourcing  in  that  stage  and  hence  Ai  =  1;  but  if  ai  >  bi  in  stage  I  (or  if  ai  > \nstage  II)  for  some  levels  of  Ai,  the outsourcing firms  in  sector i engage in outsourcing \nand  Ai  rises  above  its  initial  value  of  unity.  Further,  an  increase  in  the  volume  of \noutsourcing by the outsourcing firms elevates their production efficiency and raises the \nvalue of the labor-augmenting factor (Ai) \u2013 thus, the value of Ai implicitly measures the \nvolume of outsourcing. \n\n                                                 \n6   The  assumption  of  competitive  international  outsourcing  markets  eliminates  some  trivial  outcomes  in \n\nour comparative static analyses and allows us to focus on the environmental costs of outsourcing. \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 848 \n \n\nChoi and Yu \n\nia =\n\nAiLi\nA\nia\n\nSince  outsourcing  firms  make  profit-maximizing  decision  based  on  the  marginal \npF L )  and  the  costs  of  the  outsourced  goods  and  services  \nrevenue  product  (\ni\n+\niaA  is  an  exogenous  (or  autonomous) \nib ),  we  postulate iA  = \n(\nA a b\n(\ni\ni\ni\nA a b  is an endogenous component responding to a1 \n(\ncomponent of outsourcing and \nand  b1.

Outsourcing  occurs  up  to  the  extent  where  a1  = \n\nConsidering  Stage  III;  there  will  be  a  full-internalization  of  the  environmental  costs,  \nfb  \n*\n*\n1b =  b1  +  (A1\u20131)(db1/dA1)  = \n1\nand  dW/dA1  =  0  in  equation  (9).  In  this  case,  the  volume  of  outsourcing  obviously \nshrinks  compared  with  the  case  of  Stage  I  (where,  due  to  no  internalization  of  the \nenvironmental  costs,  outsourcing  occurs  up  to  where  a1=  b1).  However,  outsourcing \nunder  the  full-internalization  in  Stage  III  determines  the  optimal  level  of  outsourcing  \nfor  the  world,  ensuring  efficient  world-wide  resource  allocation  (including  attaining \nquality environment). In contrast, when the environmental costs are not accounted for  \nb= , and hence outsourcing occurs up to the level of a1 = b1, implying  \n(as in stage I), \nover-outsourcing  (vis-\u00e0-vis  the  optimum  level  of  outsourcing  that  occurs  at \n). \nHere,  it  is  our  view  that  the  over-outsourcing  (under  no  internalization)  in  stage  I  \nis  a  major  cause  of  massive  environmental  damage  to  the  South  (e.g.,  the  PRC).  \nThen,  what  is  the  current  state  of  internalization  in  the  North-South  outsourcing?  The \nanswer  can  be  inferred  from  the  presently  stagnating  or  even  regionally  deteriorating \nenvironmental  quality  in  the  South,  as  frequently  reported  by  the  mass  media  \n(see  Note  4).  That  is,  North-South  outsourcing  is  presently  in  a  state  of  the  partial \ninternalization  \ninternalization  of  its  environmental  costs.  Under  such  a  partial \ncb )  is  higher \n*\n(in  Stage II),  the  actual  price  of  the  outsourced  goods  and  services  (\n1\n*\nf\nc\nb\n(lower) than those under no internalization (full-internalization), i.e., \n.  \n1\n\n*\nb=\n1\n\n*\nb\n1\n\na\n1\n\nb\n1\n\n=\n\n<\n\n1\n\nf\n\nIn the present case, over-outsourcing still occurs and creates an environmental burden \nfor  the  South,  although  the  degree  of  over-outsourcing  is  less  than  that  under  \nno-internalization.  Then,  another  question  may  arise;  why  does  North-South \noutsourcing  remain  at  a  level  of  partial-,  rather  full-internalization  (under  which  the \nenvironmental  problem  would  be  resolved)?  There  are  several  possible  explanations: \nFirstly, the economies of the vendor countries in the South are still in the infant stages \nof  development,  and  hence,  are  in  need  of  international  liquidities  and  Northern \ntechnologies  to  pursue  their  primary  goals  of  economic  development.  Therefore,  they \nare reluctant to employ a potent policy that could totally discourage outsourcing by the \nNorth;  Secondly,  as  the  prices  of  outsourced  goods  and  services  go  up  due  to  the \nenvironmental  regulations  implemented  by  the  South  in  stage  II,  the  Northern  firms \nresort to counter-measures to lower the costs of outsourcing, such as vendor-country \ndiversification,  partial  outsourcing,  insourcing,  or  resourcing.10 Thirdly,  in  stage  II,  the \n                                                 \n10  When facing rising outsourcing costs due to the internalization of environmental costs, as in stage II, the \noutsourcing  firms  of  the  North  opt  to  search  for  a  new  optimal  strategy  to  lower  outsourcing  costs. \nAmong a few alternative strategies are: (a) shifting their outsourcing post(s) to other vendor countries in \nthe  South  where  the  costs  of  outsourcing  are  lower  than  the  current  vendor  countries.  This  strategy, \nleading  to  vendor  country  diversification,  as  well  as  slowing  the  rate  at  which  the  price  of  outsourced \ngoods  and  services  is  rising,  can  be  observed  in  the  migration  of  US  and  EU  firms  from  the  PRC  to \nother vendor countries in the South (where the environmental problems are less severe and the costs of \noutsourcing  are  lower  than  in  the  PRC;  i.e.,  Cambodia,  Dominican  Republic,  Ghana,  India,  Indonesia, \nMalaysia,  the  Philippines,  Rwanda,  and  Viet  Nam);    (b)  bringing  their  outsourcing  post(s)  back  to  the \nhome country in the North through insourcing or resourcing; (c) adopting a partial outsourcing strategy \nby mixing outsourcing and insourcing strategies. \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 848 \n \n\nChoi and Yu \n\nincreasing  price  of  outsourced  goods  and  services  induces  the  entry  of  new  vendor \nfirms  into  the  outsourced  industry;  thus,  the  increased  competition  among  vendors \nhinders prices from rising in the outsourcing market. Hence, we can state the following \nproposition:  \n\nProposition  3.  In  the  presence  of  the  environmental  costs  of  outsourcing,  the  optimal \noutsourcing,  as  ensuring  an  environment  acceptable  to  the  world  community,  can  be \nobtained  under  the  full-internalization  of  the  environmental  costs.  However,  if  the \nenvironmental  costs  are  not  fully  internalized,  over-outsourcing  and  environmental \ndeterioration  occurs  in  the  vendor  country.  In  this  case,  the  level  of  over-outsourcing \nand  the  degree  of  environmental  deterioration  vary  inversely  with  the  degree  of  the \ninternalization, as bounded by no versus full-internalization.  \n\nFigure 1: Gains and Losses from Internalization of Environmental  \nCosts of Outsourcing \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                                                                                                            \nIt is obvious that the choice of strategies should determine the future pattern and geography of global \noutsourcing.

In  the  graph,  A1\u20131  (or  A1)  denotes  the  level  of \noutsourcing,  and  a1  =  pFA1L1L1  indicates  the  demand  for  (or  the  marginal  revenue \nproduct  of)  A1.

CONCLUSIONS \n\nIn  recent  decades,  it  has  become  prevalent  in  world  trade  that  firms  in  one  country \noutsource  intermediate  and/or  finished  goods  or  services  from  vendor  firms  in  other \ncountries  for  the  purpose  of  increasing  production  efficiency  and  lowering  production \ncosts.  It  is  of  note  that,  while  public  focus  on  international  outsourcing  is  mainly \ndirected upon North-South outsourcing, a firm\u2019s decision to undertake outsourcing can \nbe driven by a host of factors (besides reducing labor costs). The ultimate aim thereof \nis  to  enhance  the  profitability  and  capability  of  the  firm\u2019s  operation.  To  illustrate,  both \nthe US and EU countries have outsourced materials and goods from each other. The \nPRC outsources a variety of intermediate goods (such as crude petroleum, integrated \ncircuit,  iron  ore,  gold,  and  cars)  from  Australia;  Germany;  Hong  Kong,  China;  Japan; \nthe  Republic  of  Korea,  among  others,  while  shifting  its  outsourcing  of  garments, \napparels,  toys,  foot  wares,  and  tools  to  other  developing  countries  in  Asia,  Latin \nAmerica, and Africa.  \n\nThe  evolution  of  these  outsourcing  patterns  reveals  that  (a)  outsourcing  can  occur \nuniversally among trading countries, whereby its direction can be of any type (North to \nSouth,  North  to  North,  South  to  North,  and  South  to  South).  (b)  A  generalized  theory  \nof  international  outsourcing  covering  all  possible  patterns  will  be  the  topic  of  future \nresearch. \n\nThis paper has investigated the environmental effects of international outsourcing for both \nthe  North  and  the  South  using  a  three-stage  general  equilibrium  model  of  international \ntrade. We argue that the degree of internalization remains substantially below the level that \ncan  bring  the  South  back  to  an  internationally  acceptable  level  of  environmental  quality. \nThus,  the  tightening  of  environmental  regulations  and  the  fostering  of  international \ncooperation are warranted in order to promote better welfare for all.  \n\n \n\n \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 848 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nChoi and Yu \n\nBatra, R., and H.

In stage 1, \noutsourcing  firms  in  the  North  (e.g.,  United  States  [US]  and  Europe\uff09cause  environmental \ndamage  to  the  vendor  country  in  the  South,  as  exemplified  by  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina (PRC). But, as its primary goal, the South pursuing economic development  is willing  \nto  bear  the  costs  of  environmental  degradation.  Moving  into  Stage  II,  the  environmental \ndeterioration  becomes  so  severe  in  the  South  that  the  vendor  country  begins  to  tackle  the \nenvironmental  problem  by  enacting  government  regulations.  As  a  result,  the  costs  and, \nhence,  the  prices  of  outsourced  goods  and  services  tend  to  increase  for  the  firms  in  the \nNorth.  However,  the  environmental  protection  measures  undertaken  generally  fall  short  of \nthe  levels  needed  to  restore  the  environmental  quality  acceptable  by  WHO  standards.  We \npresent  a  framework  for  analyzing  the  effects  of  international  outsourcing  on  environment \nand, ultimately, social welfare in terms of gains and losses under three alternative scenarios \nregarding  no,  partial  or  full  accountability  for  outsourcing  induced  environmental  damages. \nThe  policy  implication  is  clear:  to  fully  resolve  the  environmental  problem  in  Stage  III,  the \nimplementation  of  strong  regulations  or  the  fostering  international  cooperation  is  desirable; \nthat is, until the environmental costs of outsourcing are fully accounted for by the outsourcing \nfirms  in  the  North.  Such  firms,  however,  may  react  by  resorting  to  insourcing,  diversified \noutsourcing and other strategies. \n \nKeywords: outsourcing, labor-augmenting effect, environmental costs, internalization, \nvendor countries \n \nJEL Classification: F11, F13, F22 \n \n", " \n"]}
