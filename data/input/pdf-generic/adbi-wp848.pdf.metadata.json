INTRODUCTION \nIn recent decades, amid the increasing trend of globalization resulting from the rapid \nadvancement  in  communication  and  transportation  technology,  the  outsourcing  of \nintermediate and/or finished goods or services to firms in foreign countries for the \npurposes  of  lowering  production  costs  and  increasing  production  efficiency  has \nbecome prevalent in world trade. For example, client firms in developed countries in \nthe North (i.e., the US and EU), while maintaining management bases and conducting \nresearch  and  development  (R&D)  at  home,  shift  their  manufacturing  activities  to \ndeveloping countries in the South where labor costs are lower (e.g., the PRC, India, \nMalaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam) and/or buy a substantial amount of \nparts or services from local Southern firms.  \nIt  is  noteworthy  that,  while  the  focus  on  international  outsourcing  (also  known  as \n\u201coffshoring or fragmentation\u201d) has been mainly placed on North-South outsourcing, a \nfirm\u2019s decision to outsource can actually be driven by a variety of factors, including  \n(but not limited to) the lowering of labor costs. Such factors can be related to capital, \ntechnology and organizational competency. The paramount aim is to enhance the \noperational capability and profitability of the firm\u2019s production. To illustrate, both the US \nand EU countries outsource products from each other. The PRC outsources a variety \nof intermediate goods (such as crude petroleum, integrated circuit and iron ore) from \nAustralia; Germany; Hong Kong, China; Japan; and the Republic of Korea among \nothers, while itself shifting the outsourcing of goods (of garments, apparels, toys, foot \nwares, and tools) to other developing countries in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. The \nevolution of these outsourcing patterns over recent years reveals two important facts: \n(a) outsourcing can occur universally among countries; whereby, it can be of any \ndirection (i.e., from North to South, from North to North, from South to North, and from \nSouth to South); (b) each time goods and services are imported, the importing country \nhas  possibly  outsourced  a  portion  of  economic  activity  from  abroad  \u2013  that  is,  all \ninternational trade is likely to involve some outsourcing of intermediate inputs.  \nConsequently, international outsourcing has become a major topic for the study of \ninternational trade and stimulated a spate of intellectual contributions to the literature \nfrom economists in the field. (e.g., Chao and Yu 1993; Bhagwati, Panagariya, and \nSrinivasan 2004; Kohler 2004; Long 2005; G\u00f6rg and Hanley 2005; Jones 2005).1 \nAmong  the  rich  and  still  growing  body  of  literature  studying  various  aspects  of \ninternational outsourcing are the two notable works, both of which use the Neoclassical \nHeckscher-Ohin (HO  henceforth) general equilibrium framework: one by  Bhagwati, \nPanagariya, and Srinivasan (2004, BPS henceforth) and the other by Batra and Beladi \n(2010,  BB  henceforth).  In  the  former,  BPS  (2004)  argue  that  trade  opportunity \nincreases  as  a  result  of  advances  in  information  technology,  which  converts  the \ntraditional non-tradable service into a so-called Mode 1 service. Analytically this is \nequivalent  to  a  growth  agent.  Further,  BPS  (2004),  without  formally  integrating \noutsourcing into the Neoclassical growth model, examined the terms of trade and the \nwelfare effects of outsourcing.  \n \n   \n                                                 \n1  Other recent studies on the subject of outsourcing include Feenstra (1998), Deardorff (2001), Egger and \nEgger (2003), Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2006), Helpman, Melitz and Yeaple (2004), Jones, \nKierzkowski and Lurong (2005), among others. \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 848  Choi and Yu \n \nLater, BB (2010), inspired by Mankiw\u2019s argument for offshoring, explored several major \nproperties  of  outsourcing,  particularly  the  welfare  effect  of  international  trade,  by \nincorporating a labor-augmenting feature of outsourcing into the HO model of general \nequilibrium.2 Here, it is worthwhile to note that: (a) BPS\u2019 (2004) argument for the growth \neffect of outsourcing is confined to the case of a Mode 1 service type of outsourcing, \nwhich anticipates BB\u2019s (2010) study of the labor-augmenting effect of outsourcing;  \n(b) both BPS (2004) and BB (2010) do not expound the equivalency of the effects of \nvarious types of outsourcing on economic growth. More recently, Choi and Beladi \n(2012) extended BB\u2019s work (2010) by exploring the internal and external gains for a \nsmall outsourcing country in the presence of variable returns to scale (VRS).3  \nOver recent decades, the dramatic expansion of outsourcing by Northern firms to the \nSouth has inflicted massive damage upon the once fertile air and soil of the South. A \nmarked example is the case of the PRC, the so called \u201cWorld Factory,\u201d where the \nproduction of myriad of outsourced goods and services (i.e., garments, apparels, toys, \nfoot wares, tools, light machineries, electronics, and information-technology products) \nhas contaminated the air, water, and soil, depleted labor and material pools, triggered \ndeforestation/desertification and global warming, and (more seriously) endangered public \nhealth.  However, the vendor countries in the South are mostly developing countries \nwhose  primary  goal  is  economic  development.  Hence,  despite  the  environmental \ndamage,  they  opt  (in  their  early  period  of  international  offshoring)  to  provide  a \nhospitable business environment to Northern outsourcing firms.  \nBut,  as  outsourcing  activities  expanded,  the  environmental  costs  resulting  thereof \nbecame too heavy for the vendor countries to bear. Therefore, as beginning about a \ndecade and half ago, major vendor countries (notably the PRC) have begun to account  \nfor or internalize the environmental costs of outsourcing by enacting environmental \nregulations and taxes. This policy shift increases the prices of their outsourced goods \nand  services  to  firms  in  the  North.  However,  the  extent  of  such  a  move  is  still \nconsiderably below the level necessary to bring the South back to an acceptable \nenvironmental quality, as specified by the WHO standard. This argument is supported \nby  numerous  observations  on  the  presently  stagnating  or  regionally  deteriorating \nenvironmental quality of the PRC and its neighboring countries, including the Republic \nof  Korea,  Cambodia,  India,  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  Malaysia,  and  the \nPhilippines. To quote from a few recent reports by mass media:4 \n\u201cThe cost of environmental degradation in [the People\u2019s Republic of] China was about  \n$230 billion in 2010, or 3.5% of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product\u2014three times that \nin 2004, in local currency terms.\u201d \n\u201cThe  acidic  deposition  damages  buildings,  degrades  the  environment  and \nreduces crop yields. In India, wheat growing near a power plant suffered a 49% \nreduction in yield compared with that grown 22 kilometers away.\u201d  \n   \n                                                 \n2  See Mankiw, Romer and Weil (2004) and Mankiw and Swagel (2006) for their extensive account of the \ndebate around Mankiw\u2019s 2004 statement about welfare gains from outsourcing. \n3  BB (2010) and Choi and Beladi (2012) deal with the factor-augmenting effects of outsourcing without \nenvironmental consideration. \n4  See internet articles (i) and (v) in the Reference section for these reports.  Other reports on outsourcing \nand environmental degradation in the South include (vii), (ix), (x), and (xi), as listed in the same \nReference section. \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 848  Choi and Yu \n \nAnother development in international outsourcing is that many Northern firms have \nadopted new strategies to counter the rising costs of outsourcing, as instigated by \nSouthern  regulations.  Firms  have  resorted  to  vendor-country  diversification,  partial \noutsourcing,  insourcing,  or  resourcing.  Since  the  mid-1990s,  there  have  been \nnumerous reports about the changing patterns of outsourcing by Northern firms.5 \nThe  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  investigate  the  welfare  consequences  via  the \nenvironmental impact of international outsourcing in a three-stage model of North-\nSouth trade. In stage I, the outsourcing firms of the North inflict environmental damage \nupon the vendor country in the South, but the South (pursuing economic development \nas its primary objective) is willing to bear the burden of environmental spillovers. In \nstage II, when the environmental damages become substantial, the vendor country \nbegins to internalize the environmental costs by enacting regulations. However, the \nregulations in Stage II and the resulting increase in the price (level) of outsourced \ngoods and services are far below the level that can bring the Southern environment \nback to the internationally acceptable level. This paper assesses the gains and losses \nof the South as caused by outsourcing from the North, explicitly expounding upon the \nenvironmental costs to the South. The policy implication of our finding is clear: Further \nenvironmental regulations by the South and/or international collaboration are required \nto fully account for the environmental costs to the South, as in stage III. \n2.  ASSUMPTIONS AND THE MODEL \nWe deploy a three-stage 2x2 model to depict an outsourcing country in the North, which \nhas two sectors under perfect competition: sector 1 producing good 1 in the amount of \nX , and sector 2 producing good 2 in the amount X . Each sector utilizes two factors, \n1 2\nlabor (L) and capital (K) that are fixed in supply and perfectly mobile between the two \nsectors. Flexible wage and rental ensure the full-employment of labor (L) and capital \n(K). Since non-constant returns to scale can obscure the cost effect of outsourcing, the \npresent analysis is confined to a constant returns to scale (CRS) case. Further, it is \nassumed that, for mutual benefits, the outsourcing firms and the foreign vendor firms \nshare  technologies  in  producing  the  outsourced  goods  and  services.  The  factor \naugmenting effects of outsourcing differ depending on the direction and type of the \noutsourcing. However, this paper will focus on the labor-augmenting case because (a) \nit  is  the  major  reason  behind  the  North-South  trade  causing  the  environmental \nproblems in the South, and (b) once its effects are identified, the effects of other types \nof factor-augmenting outsourcing can be similarly deduced. In the presence of the \nlabor-augmenting effect of outsourcing, the production functions of the two sectors can \nbe written as \nX = F(AL,K )   i = 1, 2  (1) \ni i i i i\nwhere  L and  K  are  the  labor  and  capital  employed  by  sector  i,  F  is  linearly \ni   i i\nhomogeneous  in  its  inputs  and  subject  to  the  law  of  diminishing  returns,  A  is  a  \ni\nlabor-augmenting factor derived from the outsourced goods and services in sector i, \nand ( A \u20131)L  is the effective quantity of labor services supplied by the outsourcing \ni i\nactivity. Equation (1) shows that, in sector i, A  is initially equal to unity in the absence \ni\nof outsourcing. As the firms in the sector engage in outsourcing,  A  rises above its \ni\n                                                 \n5  For media reports on the recently changing patterns of outsourcing, see internet articles (ii), (iii), (iv), \n(vi), (viii) and (xii) in the References section. \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 848  Choi and Yu \n \nvalue of unity and renders an automatic reduction in the use of domestic labor via a \nlabor-augmenting effect upon the sector\u2019s productivity. That is, A  is a choice variable \ni\nto the X  producers that increases with the volume of outsourcing; further, it cannot be \ni\nless than unity because that would mean that outsourcing raises firms\u2019 unit costs. \nFurther, dA = 0 in the absence of outsourcing, and dA = d(A \u22121)> 0 in the presence \ni i i\nof an additional outsourcing in sector i.  \nLet  p denote the price of good i (i =1, 2), and p =  p / p p the relative price of  \ni  1 2 =  1 \ngood 1 in terms of good 2setting  p = 1 initially. Then, the marginal revenue product \n  2 \n(or the value of the marginal product) of the labor-augmenting factor  A ( A ) can, \n1  2\nrespectively, be written as a = p (\u2202F /\u2202A)= p(\u2202F /\u2202AL )(\u2202AL /\u2202A) = pF L  > 0 \n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 A1L1 1\nand a =(\u2202F /\u2202A )= (\u2202F /\u2202A L )(\u2202A L /\u2202A ) =F L  > 0 where \u2202F /\u2202AL  =F , \n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 A2L2 2 i i i AiLi\nand \u22022F /\u2202(AL)2 <0 due to diminishing returns (i =1, 2).  \ni i i\nAssuming  that  presence  of  many  outsourcing  firms  and  vendor  firms  renders  the \ninternational outsourcing market as competitive as all other input markets, outsourcing \nfirms are thus the price takers of the labor-augmenting factor (A) in each stage of \ni\noutsourcing.6 In stage I, the outsourcing by the Northern firms inflicts environmental \ndamages  to  the  South,  but  the  vendor  country  (with  its  primary  objective  being \neconomic growth) is willing to bear the environmental costs of outsourcing. Therefore, \nthe actual price of the labor-augmenting factor (A) in this stage does not include the \ni\nenvironmental cost. However, moving into stage II, when the environmental damage \nbecome significant, the vendor country begins to internalize the environmental costs by \nenacting  regulations.  Consequentially,  vender  firms  begin  to  raise  the  prices  of \noutsourced goods and services due to higher costs. Let b and b* respectively denote \ni i\nthe  actual  price  (reflecting  the  marginal  cost)  level  of  the  outsourced  goods  and \nservices (A) in terms  of good 2 in stage I and stage II. Assuming a competitive \ni\ninternational  outsourcing  market  in  each  stage,  b  ( b* )  is  perceived  as  a  given \ni i\nparameter by both the outsourcers and the vendors. Then b* \u2013 b > 0 can be shown \ni i\ngraphically  as  the  upward  shift  in  the  perfectly  elastic  supply  curve  of  A  to  the \ni\noutsourcing firms resulting from the regulatory measures of the environmental costs in \nstage  II.  Since  the  firms  engage  in  outsourcing  mainly  to  lower  their  costs  of \nproduction, we postulate,  \nA= 1, if a \u2264 b in stage I (or if a \u2264b* in stage II) for all levels of A\ni i i i i i \nand A > 1  if a > bi in stage I (or if a > b* in stage II) for some levels of A.

Further, an increase in the volume of \ni\noutsourcing by the outsourcing firms elevates their production efficiency and raises the \nvalue of the labor-augmenting factor (A) \u2013 thus, the value of A implicitly measures the \ni i\nvolume of outsourcing. \n                                                 \n6  The assumption of competitive international outsourcing markets eliminates some trivial outcomes in \nour comparative static analyses and allows us to focus on the environmental costs of outsourcing. \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 848  Choi and Yu \n \nSince  outsourcing  firms  make  profit-maximizing  decision  based  on  the  marginal \nrevenue product (a = pF L ) and the costs of the outsourced goods and services  \ni AiLi i\n(b ), we postulate A  =  A + A(a b) where  A  is an exogenous (or autonomous) \ni i ia i i, i ia\ncomponent of outsourcing and A(a b) is an endogenous component responding to a  \ni i, i 1\nand b . This is similar to the well-known macroeconomic procedure used to obtain \n1\nconsumption or import multipliers.

(4) \n1 2\nThe  system  of  equations  consisting  of  (1)\u2013(4)  represents  the  production  side  of  \nthe general equilibrium model of outsourcing. To facilitate the ensuing analysis, it is \nimperative to conduct a comparative static analysis to identify two basic properties of \nthe present model, namely, sectoral output response to outsourcing and sectoral output \nresponse to price change. \nSince the derivation of these effects is quite lengthy, we relegate it to the Appendix and \nstate only the summary results in the following proposition:7 \nProposition  1:  (i)  For  a  given  commodity\u2019s  prices  and  the  environmental  cost  of \noutsourcing, outsourcing gives rise to an ultra-biased effect on sectoral outputs (i.e., it \nincreases the output of the outsourcing sector at the expense of that of the other);  \n(ii) For a given level of outsourcing and the environmental cost of outsourcing, sectoral \noutput responds positively to its relative price.  \nTo be specific, the ultra-biased effects on sectoral outputs implies dX /dA >0 and \ni i\ndX /dA >0 (i, j =1, 2; i \u2260 j), and the positive price-output response in each sector \nj i\nmeans dX /dp>0 and dX /dp >0. \n1 2\nMeanwhile,  the  demand  side  of  the  outsourcing  country  is  represented  by  the \nexpenditures function \nE(p, U)=min (pD +D ),  \n1 2\n                                                 \n7  Choi and Beladi (2012) conducted a similar comparative static analysis under variable returns to scale \n(VRS). To focus on the environmental costs of outsourcing, our analysis is confined to CRS case. \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 848  Choi and Yu \n \nwhere D  (i =1, 2) is the consumption of the two goods, and U is a strictly quasi-\ni\nconcave utility function, U(D,D )\u2265U. Note that the expenditure function is derived by \n1 2\nminimizing the expenditure subject to a utility constraint. \n3.  OUTSOURCING, ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS, \nINTERNALIZATION, AND WELFARE \nThe  economy's  budget  constraint  stipulates  that  the  total  value  of  expenditure  is \ndetermined by the value of national income: \nE(p, U) = I,   (5) \nwhere I[= pX + X \u2212b(A \u22121)\u2212b (A \u22121)] denotes the national income expressed in \n1 2 1 1 2 2\nterms of good 2. free trade is assumed so that the domestic prices and the international \nprices of the traded goods are synchronized at the ratio of p.

We may postulate that  \nX = X (A,p) \ni i 1\nso that  \ndX \u2202X \u2202X dp\ni = i + i ,  i = 1, 2.

Without fully internalizing \n1 1 1\nenvironmental costs, outsourcing depletes environment quality during stage I; but in \nstage II, the South enacts environmental regulations to account for the environmental \ncosts, thereby increasing the price of outsourced goods and service ((A \u20131)(db /dA )  \n1 1 1\n> 0). Hence, in stage II, b*= b + (A \u20131)(db /dA ) is regarded as the new exogenously \n1 1  1 1 1\ngiven parameter by the Northern outsourcing firms.  \nEquation (9) shows that, in the absence of environmental costs, ((A \u20131)(db /dA ) = 0)), \n1 1 1\nb  = b*. Therefore, outsourcing should occur until a = b (or a = b*), where dW/dA   \n1 1 1 1  1  1 1\n= 0. This implies that outsourcing necessarily enhances the welfare of the outsourcing \ncountry and attains the optimum resource allocation for the world as well. Hence, the \nfollowing proposition: \nProposition 2. In the absence of induced environmental cost, outsourcing enhances the \nwelfare up to the optimal level of both the country and the world.  \n                                                 \n9  This model can be extended to a large country case where the terms of trade are variable. See for \nexample, Choi and Yu (1985). \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 848  Choi and Yu \n \nHowever, when environmental costs exist, ((A \u20131)(db /dA ) > 0), the actual cost of \n1 1 1\noutsourcing paid by the Northern firms in Stage II (b*) depends on the degree of \n1\ninternalization of the environmental costs, as subject to the regulations of the South. \nSpecifically, based on the extent of internalization, the marginal cost of outsourcing to \nthe outsourcing country (b*) in Stage II can be positioned somewhere between the two \n1\nextreme values, namely, b  under no internalization and b*f under full-internalization, \n1 1\ni.e., b  \u2264 b*\u2264 b*f .  \n1 1 1\nConsidering Stage III; there will be a full-internalization of the environmental costs,  \nb*= b + (A \u20131)(db /dA ) = b*f . Outsourcing occurs up to the extent where a = b*f  \n1 1  1 1 1 1 1  1\nand dW/dA = 0 in equation (9). In this case, the volume of outsourcing obviously \n1 \nshrinks compared with the case of Stage I (where, due to no internalization of the \nenvironmental costs, outsourcing occurs up to where a = b ). However, outsourcing \n1 1\nunder the full-internalization in Stage III determines the optimal level of outsourcing  \nfor  the  world,  ensuring  efficient  world-wide  resource  allocation  (including  attaining \nquality environment). In contrast, when the environmental costs are not accounted for  \n(as in stage I), b* =b , and hence outsourcing occurs up to the level of a = b , implying  \n1 1 1  1\nover-outsourcing (vis-\u00e0-vis the optimum level of outsourcing that occurs at a =b*f ). \n1 1\nHere, it is our view that the over-outsourcing (under no internalization) in stage I  \nis a major cause of massive environmental damage to the South (e.g., the PRC).  \nThen, what is the current state of internalization in the North-South outsourcing? The \nanswer can be inferred from the presently stagnating or even regionally deteriorating \nenvironmental  quality  in  the  South,  as  frequently  reported  by  the  mass  media  \n(see Note 4). That is, North-South outsourcing is presently in a state of the partial \ninternalization  of  its  environmental  costs.  Under  such  a  partial  internalization  \n(in Stage II), the actual price of the outsourced goods and services (b*c) is higher \n1\n(lower) than those under no internalization (full-internalization), i.e., b <b*c =b*f .  \n1 1 1\nIn the present case, over-outsourcing still occurs and creates an environmental burden \nfor  the  South,  although  the  degree  of  over-outsourcing  is  less  than  that  under  \nno-internalization.  Then,  another  question  may  arise;  why  does  North-South \noutsourcing remain at a level of partial-, rather full-internalization (under which the \nenvironmental problem would be resolved)? There are several possible explanations: \nFirstly, the economies of the vendor countries in the South are still in the infant stages \nof  development,  and  hence,  are  in  need  of  international  liquidities  and  Northern \ntechnologies to pursue their primary goals of economic development. Therefore, they \nare reluctant to employ a potent policy that could totally discourage outsourcing by the \nNorth; Secondly, as the prices of outsourced goods and services go up due to the \nenvironmental regulations implemented by the South in stage II, the Northern firms \nresort to counter-measures to lower the costs of outsourcing, such as vendor-country \ndiversification, partial outsourcing, insourcing, or resourcing.10 Thirdly, in stage II, the \n                                                 \n10  When facing rising outsourcing costs due to the internalization of environmental costs, as in stage II, the \noutsourcing firms of the North opt to search for a new optimal strategy to lower outsourcing costs. \nAmong a few alternative strategies are: (a) shifting their outsourcing post(s) to other vendor countries in \nthe South where the costs of outsourcing are lower than the current vendor countries. This strategy, \nleading to vendor country diversification, as well as slowing the rate at which the price of outsourced \ngoods and services is rising, can be observed in the migration of US and EU firms from the PRC to \nother vendor countries in the South (where the environmental problems are less severe and the costs of \noutsourcing are lower than in the PRC; i.e., Cambodia, Dominican Republic, Ghana, India, Indonesia, \nMalaysia, the Philippines, Rwanda, and Viet Nam);  (b) bringing their outsourcing post(s) back to the \nhome country in the North through insourcing or resourcing; (c) adopting a partial outsourcing strategy \nby mixing outsourcing and insourcing strategies. \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 848  Choi and Yu \n \nincreasing price of outsourced goods and services induces the entry of new vendor \nfirms into the outsourced industry; thus, the increased competition among vendors \nhinders prices from rising in the outsourcing market. Hence, we can state the following \nproposition:  \nProposition 3. In the presence of the environmental costs of outsourcing, the optimal \noutsourcing, as ensuring an environment acceptable to the world community, can be \nobtained  under  the  full-internalization  of  the  environmental  costs.  However,  if  the \nenvironmental  costs  are  not  fully  internalized,  over-outsourcing  and  environmental \ndeterioration occurs in the vendor country. In this case, the level of over-outsourcing \nand the degree of environmental deterioration vary inversely with the degree of the \ninternalization, as bounded by no versus full-internalization.  \nFigure 1: Gains and Losses from Internalization of Environmental  \nCosts of Outsourcing \n \n   \n                                                                                                                                            \nIt is obvious that the choice of strategies should determine the future pattern and geography of global \noutsourcing.

In the graph, A \u20131 (or A ) denotes the level of \n1 1\noutsourcing, and a  = pFA1L1L1 indicates the demand for (or the marginal revenue \n1\nproduct of) A . Since the outsourcing firms are the price takers of A , they face a \n1 1\nperfectly elastic supply curve of A  at b  (b*) when the environmental costs are not \n1 1 1\n(are) internalized by the South in stage 1 (stage II). In stage I, when outsourcing \nbetween the South and the North takes place at the price of b , equilibrium outsourcing \n1\noccurs at g and the level of outsourcing is An \u22121. It is clear that the North gains by  \n1\nthe area of b b*f dg because it pays no environmental cost, and the South loses by  \n1 1\nthe area of b b*f hg because it bears the whole burden of the environmental costs. \n1 1\nTherefore, the welfare loss occurs to the world by the area of dhg, which represents the \ndeadweight loss caused by the misallocation of resources due to over-outsourcing. \nThat  is,  in  stage  I,  the  South  subsidizes  the  North  in  terms  of  enduring  the \nenvironmental costs of outsourcing.  \nIn stage II, the actual price of the outsourced goods and services (b*) depends on the \n1\ndegree of the internalization of the environmental costs. Under the full-internalization \nscheme in Stage III, the price is b*f . Thus, the transition from Stage I through Stage II \n1\nto Stage III entails movement of the equilibrium point from g to d, and hence decreases \nthe level of outsourcing from An \u22121 to Af \u22121. As a result, the North loses by b b*f dg, \n1 1 1 1\nthe South gains b b*f hg, and the world gains by dhg owing to the recovery of the \n1 1\ndeadweight loss of stage I. This confirms that the optimum level of outsourcing to the \nworld  community  occurs  when  the  environmental  costs  of  outsourcing  are  fully \ninternalized.  \nSuppose,  as  of  now,  the  North-South  outsourcing  industry  is  in  a  state  of  partial \ninternalization (as in stage II), such that, in Figure 1, the price of the outsourced goods \nand  services  ( b*c )  is  situated  between  b and b*f (i.e.,  b   < b*c < b*f ),  and  the \n1 1  1 1 1 1\nequilibrium outsourcing point is e.

CONCLUSIONS \nIn recent decades, it has become prevalent in world trade that firms in one country \noutsource intermediate and/or finished goods or services from vendor firms in other \ncountries for the purpose of increasing production efficiency and lowering production \ncosts.  It  is  of  note  that,  while  public  focus  on  international  outsourcing  is  mainly \ndirected upon North-South outsourcing, a firm\u2019s decision to undertake outsourcing can \nbe driven by a host of factors (besides reducing labor costs). The ultimate aim thereof \nis to enhance the profitability and capability of the firm\u2019s operation. To illustrate, both \nthe US and EU countries have outsourced materials and goods from each other. The \nPRC outsources a variety of intermediate goods (such as crude petroleum, integrated \ncircuit, iron ore, gold, and cars) from Australia; Germany; Hong Kong, China; Japan; \nthe  Republic  of  Korea,  among  others,  while  shifting  its  outsourcing  of  garments, \napparels,  toys,  foot  wares,  and  tools  to  other  developing  countries  in  Asia,  Latin \nAmerica, and Africa.  \nThe evolution of these outsourcing patterns reveals that (a) outsourcing can occur \nuniversally among trading countries, whereby its direction can be of any type (North to \nSouth, North to North, South to North, and South to South). (b) A generalized theory  \nof international outsourcing covering all possible patterns will be the topic of future \nresearch. \nThis paper has investigated the environmental effects of international outsourcing for both \nthe North and the South using a three-stage general equilibrium model of international \ntrade. We argue that the degree of internalization remains substantially below the level that \ncan bring the South back to an internationally acceptable level of environmental quality. \nThus,  the  tightening  of  environmental  regulations  and  the  fostering  of  international \ncooperation are warranted in order to promote better welfare for all.  \n   \n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 848  Choi and Yu \n \nREFERENCES \nBatra, R., and H.

In stage 1, outsourcing firms in the North (e.g., United States and Europe\uff09cause environmental damage to the vendor country in the South, as exemplified by the People\u2019s Republic of China. But, as its primary goal, the South pursuing economic development is willing to bear the costs of environmental degradation. Moving into Stage II, the environmental deterioration becomes so severe in the South that the vendor country begins to tackle the environmental problem by enacting government regulations. As a result, the costs and, hence, the prices of outsourced goods and services tend to increase for the firms in the North. However, the environmental protection measures undertaken generally fall short of the levels needed to restore the environmental quality acceptable by World Health Organization standards. We present a framework for analyzing the effects of international outsourcing on environment and, ultimately, social welfare in terms of gains and losses under three alternative scenarios regarding no, partial, or full accountability for outsourcing induced environmental damages. The policy implication is clear: to fully resolve the environmental problem in Stage III, the implementation of strong regulations or the fostering international cooperation is desirable; that is, until the environmental costs of outsourcing are fully accounted for by the outsourcing firms in the North. Such firms, however, may react by resorting to insourcing, diversified outsourcing and other strategies.", "Title": "International Outsourcing, Environmental Costs, and Welfare"}}
