INTRODUCTION \n\nTu, Sarker, and Rasoulinezhad \n\nGreen bonds (GBs) have been widely applied all over the world and are considered a \nfinancial tool to raise capital for projects that benefit the environment (World Bank 2019). \nThe  money  raised  by  GB  issuance  is  committed  to  investment  in  programs  which \nenhance adaptation and lessen the effects of climate change, including projects about \nclean energy, public transport, and clean water.  \n\nThe  GB  concept  was  proposed  by  the  World  Bank  in  the  Strategic  Framework  on \nDevelopment and Climate Change in 2008 as a solution to help countries around the \nworld raise capital for strategies to solve the problem of air pollution and global climate \nchange (Trang 2015). International Capital Market Association in the 2016 report of The \nGreen  Bond  Principles  (GBP)  define  GBs  as  any  type  of  bond  whose  proceeds  from \nbond  issuance  are  used  to  finance  different  projects  related  to  green  energy  sources \nwhich are eligible for funding and comply with the four principles of the GBP. Potential \nprojects  can  be \nincluding  \nfunded  by  GB  mobilization,  according \n(but not limited to) areas such as green energy sources, intensity of energy in societies, \nwaste  disposal,  animal  conservation,  environmentally  friendly  transport,  sustainable \nmanagement  of  natural  resources,  and  projects  related  to  environmental  problem \nadaptation.  Generally,  GBs  are  a  kind  of  debt  security  having  a  number  of  common \nbonds characteristics and can help governments to attract capital for projects that benefit \nthe  environment.  According  to  the  definition  by  the  International  Capital  Market \nAssociation (2016), GBs are bonds issued to raise funds for the government, banking, \nand  local  or  issuing  businesses,  labeling  GBs  by  governments  as  debt  securities \nincluding securitization, private issuance, and guaranteed bonds.  \n\nto  GBP, \n\nis \n\nto \n\nfund  special  environment-related  projects, \n\nThe characteristic which separates GBs from other common bonds is that the purpose \nincluding \nof  GB  mobilization \nenvironmental projects and projects with environmental benefits. In addition, because of \nthe  purpose  of  the  capital,  GBs  have  a  number  of  special provisions  in  terms  of debt \nrepayment  mechanism,  and  recourse  or  nonrecourse  of  issuing  organizations.  GBs  \nare  only  different  from  other  types of  bond  on two  basic  points:  (i)  the  proceeds  after \nsubtracting  the  costs  related  to  the  offering  are  used  to  finance  or  refinance  green \nprojects, environmental projects, or projects with environmental benefits; and (ii) there \nare  different  provisions  in  terms  of  debt  repayment  mechanism,  and  recourse  or \nnonrecourse of issuing organizations.  \n\nGB  development  is  beneficial  for  bond  issuers,  investors,  and  society.  With  regard  \nto  issuers,  the  issuance  of  GB  in  the  stock  market  will  help  to  diversify  investors, \nespecially investors who are interested in special aspects such as corporate governance \nand  social  factors  in  the  process  of  investing. With  regard  to  investors,  GBs  will be  a \ngood financial asset for investment to help diversify investment portfolios, disperse risks, \nand  find  appropriate  resources.  According  to  the  trend  that  countries  are  focusing  on \nsustainable  development  and  greening  the  economy,  the  GB  market  will  constantly \nincrease in terms of both quantity and quality. Therefore, this will be a kind of asset that \nis highly appreciated, stable, and has good liquidity with long maturity. With regard to \nsociety, GBs are also an effective tool to raise investors\u2019 awareness about projects which \ndeal with climate change and environmental pollution. At the same time, the issuance of \nGBs  will  help  to  attract  large  capital  flows  in  society  to  support  the  implementation  of \nenvironmentally  friendly  projects  and  meet  social  responsibility  goals,  contributing  to \nsustainable development in the future. \n\n \n\n \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1082 \n \n\nTu, Sarker, and Rasoulinezhad \n\nAccording to the above advantages of GBs, Viet Nam\u2019s government is trying to develop \nthis kind of bond in the country. The purpose here is to ascertain what factors can impact \non  GB  market  development  in  Viet  Nam.  This  will  be  investigated  using  the  analytic \nhierarchy process (AHP), a method that enables us to gather different experts\u2019 opinions, \nanalyze, and rank factors influencing GB market development in Viet Nam. \n\nBased on the freshness of the green bond issue in academic sectors and the knowledge \nof the authors, there has been no serious academic study focusing on analyzing different \nfactors influencing GB market development, particularly in Viet Nam via a multi-criteria \ndecision-making model. This gap is filled by the novelty of our research. \n\nThe  structure  of  the  rest  of  the  paper  is  as  follows.  Section  2  offers  a  brief  literature \nreview. In Section 3, a number of earlier empirical studies are represented. Section 4 \npresents the research methodology. In Section 5, the results of the AHP are stated. We \nconclude the paper in Section 6. \n\n2.  LITERATURE REVIEW \n\n2.1  The Green Bond Market in Southeast Asian Countries \n\nThe  Association  of  Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN),  with  an  economic  size  of  \n$2.57 trillion in 2016, is one of the largest economic groups in the world. The GB market \nin ASEAN has developed rapidly, indicating the expanded role of this kind of bond in the \nfinancial  markets  of  ASEAN.  The  following  Table  1  represents  the  GB  issuance \ncharacteristics in 2018. \n\nTable 1: GB Issuance in ASEAN Countries \n\nGroup of Countries \nASEAN \nAsia and the Pacific (APAC) \nASEAN share of APAC \nASEAN share of global \n\nShare of GB Market in \nFinancial Markets  \n(%) \n6 \n17 \n35 \n11 \n\nNumber of \nGB Issuers \n19 \n206 \n9 \n3 \n\nValue of Total \nIssued GB  \n($ billion) \n5 \n108 \n5 \n1 \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 compilation from https://www.climatebonds.net/. \n\nHistorically, issuance of GB was started by development banks in 2007\u20132008 in order to \nexpand the financing of projects related to emissions reduction projects. Asia and the \nPacific\u2019s GB issuers began their activities in the market in 2013, and in recent years their \ncontribution to world GB issuance has been nearly 22%.  \n\nIn recent years, there has been vast diversification in the GB market in ASEAN, and in \n2016  Asia Pacific  Renewables  was  ranked  first  among  GB  issuers  in  the  region,  with \nnearly $226 million of GB. This top ranking of ASEAN GB issuers is a guarantee of their \nefficient work and activities in local, regional and global financial markets.  \n\nGB  issuers  from  Singapore  and  Malaysia  entered  the  market  in  2017,  expanding  \nthe  financial  turnover  in  the  GB  market.  In  addition,  GB  issuers  from  Indonesia  and \nThailand joined this market in first and second quarters of 2018, respectively. Indonesia\u2019s \nissue  of  $1.25  billion  of  green  Sukuk  bonds  in  2018  was  significant  in  this  country \nbecoming the fifth most influential nation in the GB market. Interestingly, the major GB \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1082 \n \n\nTu, Sarker, and Rasoulinezhad \n\nissuers are non-financial institutions in the region, owning nearly 30% of the total GBs \nissued in this region. Moreover, green loans (GLs) are an important complementary part \nof GB (for instance, GLs are common among Singaporean real estate companies), being \na major feature of the ASEAN bond market. The issue volume of GLs in ASEAN is $1.1 \nbillion which is equal to approximately 22% of the aggregate transactions volume in the \nregion. \n\nIn regard to the question of which country contributes more to the ASEAN GB market, \nIndonesia  (TLFF  I  is  the  largest  GB  issuer  of  this  country)  is  the  first  contributor  and \nprovides nearly 40% of total GB issuance in ASEAN. The second and third contributors \nare Singapore (the only GB issuer being Sindicatum Renewable Energy Company) and \nMalaysia, with shares of 35% and 19%, respectively. \n\nThe next important GB issuers in the region are Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \nDespite major contributions of different members of ASEAN, it is clear that the number \nof GB issuers in the region is quite a few.  \n\nOverall,  it  is  clear  that  GB  issuing  has  attracted  the  attention  of  financial  sectors  in \nASEAN and has developed rapidly in the last decade. It seems that the ASEAN region \ncan be considered one of the main GB markets in the world, where the issuance and use \nof GBs have a significant share in total bond markets. \n\n2.2  The Green Bond Market in Viet Nam \n\nindicates \n\nthe  Mekong  River  Delta. \n\nthe  Red  River  Delta  and \n\nThe province of Ba Ria-Vung Tau and Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City) are the first two places \nin Viet Nam where the Vietnamese Dong (VND)-denominated GBs are represented on \nthe Hanoi Stock Exchange. In Viet Nam, climate change has increased the level and the \ncycle of natural disasters such as droughts, floods, and sea level rise, seriously affecting \nthe  socio-economic  development  and  people\u2019s  lives.  Research  by  international \norganizations  also \nthat  climate  change  could  cost  Viet  Nam  \n$15 billion per year, equivalent to 5% of GDP. Vietnamese authorities also estimate that \neach one-meter rise in the sea level will affect the lives of about 20% of the population. \nFlooding and saline intrusion due to sea level rise will narrow the area of agricultural land \nin  both \nIndustries  \nwill also be affected because of a shortage of raw materials and energy, leading to higher \nproduction costs. In this context, Viet Nam determines that green growth is an important \nstrategy for sustainable development. Pursuant to Resolution No 24-NQ/TW of 3 June \n2013 of the 11th Central Committee about being active in response to climate change, \nimprovement  of  natural  resource  management,  and  environmental  protection,  on  20 \nOctober 2015, the Minister of Finance issued Decision 2183/QD-BTC approving the road \nmap of the financial sector in Viet Nam to conduct the national strategy on green growth \ntoward 2020. Accordingly, the Decision clearly stated the formulation and improvement \nof the financial policy framework to develop the green capital market and green financial \nproducts. Green capital market policies include setting up a green financial framework \nfor activities on the capital market such as issuing regulations and conditions for stock \nlisting (green listing), reporting (sustainable reporting), and monitoring (green financial \ncriteria);  mobilizing  funds  to  invest  in  green  growth  through  capital  markets  for  green \nbusinesses,  projects,  and  products  through  listing  and  issuing  green  stocks;  issuing \nbonds and investment certificates for green projects, programs, and fields; developing \ngreen  indicators  for  monitoring,  evaluating,  and  trading  on  capital  markets;  issuing \nregulations  or  guidelines  on  environmental  and  social  risk  management  for  market \norganizations  and  for  market  members  who  are  financial  institutions  and  listed \nbusinesses. \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1082 \n \n\nTu, Sarker, and Rasoulinezhad \n\nAfter a period of application, the GB concept was officially recognized in 2018 in Item 1, \nArticle 21, Decree 95/2018/ND-CP. Accordingly, \u201cGreen bonds are government bonds \nissued  for  raising  funds  for  environmental  projects  as  defined  in  the  Law  on \nenvironmental protection (also called green projects) and included in the list of projects \nto  which  public  investment  funds  are  allocated  in  accordance  with  the  Law  on  public \ninvestment  and  the  Law  on  state  budget.\u201d  Defined  GB  products  include:  (i)  green \ncorporate bonds, issued for green projects or green products; and (2) government bonds \nand  local  government  bonds,  issued  for  green  goals,  programs,  and  projects.  \nIn  order  to  develop  an  open  bond  market  and  approach  international  standards,  on  \n14  August  2017,  the  Prime  Minister  issued  Decision  No.  1191/QD-TTg  approving  \nthe  bond  market  development  road  map  during  2017\u20132020,  as  a  long-run  approach \ntoward 2030. Accordingly, the decision sets out the development viewpoints: develop the \nbond  market  both  extensively  and  intensively,  ensuring  systemic  safety,  gradually \napproaching  international  practices  and  standards  and  modernizing  the  market\u2019s \ninfrastructure,  thus  turning  it  into  a  crucial  channel  for  raising  medium-  and  long-term \ncapital at reasonable capital costs; continue focusing on expanding the government bond \nmarket  as  a  useful \nfurther  develop  \nthe corporate bond market to create favorable conditions for enterprises to raise capital, \nespecially medium- and long-term capital, thereby enhancing their corporate governance \nand information disclosure. The objectives are that the outstanding balance of the bond \nmarket  will  reach  around  45%  of  GDP  by  2020  and  65%  of  GDP  by  2030,  and  the \noutstanding balance of the market of corporate bonds will reach about 7% of GDP by \n2020  and  around  20%  of  GDP  by  2030.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  shall  assume  prime \nresponsibility; the State Bank of Viet Nam shall coordinate with the Ministry of Planning \nand  Investment  to  promulgate  mechanisms  and  policies  aiming  to  develop  the  GB \nmarket to create favorable conditions for issuing entities to mobilize capital through bond \nissuance  to  implement  green  projects.  The  policy  of  sustainable  and  environmentally \nand  \nwas \nfriendly \nthe  Government  in  Resolution  No  24-NQ/TW,  dated  3  June  2013  of  the  11th  Central \nCommittee;  Decision  No.  1393/QD-TTg,  dated  25  September  2012  approving  the \nnational strategy on green growth; Decision No. 403/QD-TTg, dated 20 March 2014 on \napproval of the National Action Plan on green growth in Viet Nam for the period of 2014\u2013\n2020; and Decision No. 2053/QD-TTg, dated 28 October 2016, promulgating the action \nplan for implementing the Paris Agreement to combat CO2 emissions. \n\nthe  bond  market;  and \n\ndevelopment \n\neconomic \n\nto  grow \n\nguided \n\nParty \n\ntool \n\nthe \n\nby \n\nIn Decision No. 1191/QD-TTg, dated 14 August 2017, explaining the road map of bond \nmarket expansion over the period of 2017\u20132020 as a main part of the long-run approach \nof  2030,  the  Prime  Minister  assigned  the  task  of  developing  the  GB  market  \nto  create  favorable  conditions  for  issuing  entities  to  mobilize  capital  through  bond \nissuance  to  implement  green  projects.  Implementing  the  party  and  government \nguidelines  in  the  above  documents,  the  draft  Decree  states  that  GBs  are  a  type  of \ngovernment bond, complying with the issuance process of government debt tools for the \npurpose of using the capital from GB issuance for green projects; every year the issuer \nhas to report the use of capital for green projects and assess the environmental impacts. \nOn  6  August  2015,  the  Governor  of  the  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam  issued  Decision  No. \n1552/QD-NHNN  on  issuance  of  the  banking  sector\u2019s  action  plan  to  implement  the \nnational strategy on green growth toward 2020. However, for a developing country like \nViet Nam, the national budget is still tight and the support of international organizations \nis limited, and so the active participation of the financial system in the greening campaign \nof the economy plays a very important role. According to the United Nations Environment \nProgramme  (UNEP  2016),  an  eco-friendly  economy  (green  economy)  is  an  economy \naimed at improving people\u2019s happiness and social justice, and significantly reducing the \nrisk of environmental degradation. A green economy is an economy where people are \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1082 \n \n\nTu, Sarker, and Rasoulinezhad \n\nthe center and policies create new resources, such as the Financial Monetary Market \nPolicy, \ndated  \n24  August  2016,  on  sustainable  and  equal  economic  growth.  Green  growth  is  a \ndevelopment  model  that  focuses  on  improving  the  quality  of  growth,  changing  the \nproduction structure and consumption in a sustainable way, and improving people\u2019s lives, \ncombating  carbon  emissions  and  raising  adaptability  to  the  threat  of  global  warming \n(UNEP 2016). \n\n3.  EMPIRICAL STUDIES \n\nFinding  an  efficient  solution  to  the  problem  of  global  warming  and  air  pollution  has \nattracted the wide attention of scholars. Using new financial tools is proposed as a way \nto move and shift from the current position to a better eco-friendly (green) economy. \n\nMonasterolo and Raberto (2018) discuss that fiscal and monetary policies can present a \nnew financial tool to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. Using a developed flow-of-\nfunds  behavioral  model  they  determine  the  significant  impact  of  the  investment  of \ncompanies on the brown and eco-friendly sectors, on the unemployment rate in society, \nand on credit and bond markets. They conclude that green public policy is an appropriate \nway to ensure green growth by affecting the activities of credit markets.  \n\nAccording to the study by Wang and Zhi (2016), green finance is a fresh financial method \nfor  connecting  environmental  goals  with  economic  growth.  The  authors  \nstudy  the  current  status  of  green  finance  in  the  field  of  renewable  energy  and  find  \nsome shortcomings, proposing some solutions for market mechanism development and \npolicy \nfinance  and \nenvironmental  protection,  the  authors  propose  practical  solutions  to  achieve  a  better \necological balance. \n\ninternal  conflicts  between  green \n\nformulation.  Showing \n\nthe \n\nCatalin  Voica,  Panait,  and  Alin  Haralambie  (2015)  believe  that  climate  change  has \nnegative  impacts  to  a  large  extent  on  the  activities  of  economic  actors.  Gradually, \ncompanies  and  public  institutions  have  recognized  the  need  to  adapt  to  new  climate \nconditions,  leading  to  the  adoption  of  environmentally  friendly  behaviors  and  the \npromotion  of  socially  responsible  strategies.  The  authors  evaluate  the  role  of  private \ninvestors and public agencies in green investment, mainly in the infrastructure and the \ngovernment, creating the legal and institutional framework to encourage direct investors \nand portfolios in this area. \n\nAccording to Flaherty et al. (2017), funding projects related to the mitigation of carbon \ndioxide and adopting various policies is an important program in the current decade. The \nauthors  state  that  a  vast  number  of  eco-friendly  projects  have  failed  due  to  lack  of \nfinancing.  Hence,  strengthening  green  projects\u2019  financing  would  be  a  useful  way  to \nconduct efficient policies.  \n\nSachs  (2014)  proposes  sharing  the  interdisciplinary  burden,  showing  that  the \nimplementation  of  climate  policies  has  a  positive  relationship  with  the  Pareto \nimprovement strategy in both the short and long run. According to the author, the GB \nproposal  represents  an  opportunity  that  can  be  carried  out  immediately  to  begin  the \nSachs plan: GB issuance can finance essential projects in decarbonizing so that debt \ncan  be  paid  through  long-run  programs.  Since  future  generations  will  benefit  from \nlowering the threat of climate change, they are a better candidate to pay the debt.  \n\nMegwai, Njie, and Richards (2016) investigate the role of national strategies and policies \nin green economic improvement in selected developing countries. The major findings of \nthe study reveal that there are specific dissimilarities in national strategies from country \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1082 \n \n\nTu, Sarker, and Rasoulinezhad \n\nto country for reasons such as level of development, institutional capacity, government \nmanagement,  and  the  efficiency  of  production  inputs.  The  authors  recommend \nconducting  the  \u20186Is\u2019  policy  in  some  selected  UN  member  states,  namely  Croatia, \nEthiopia, Kenya, Thailand, and Guyana.  \n\nAksorn and Charoenngam (2016) attempt to analyze life cycle management through the \nprocess of community infrastructure development by applying a triangulation technique \nin the case of Thailand. They find that establishing a green finance infrastructure is a \nmajor key to develop green economy aspects in Thailand. \n\nRoutroy and Kumar (2016) focus on the green capability to improve the manufacturing \nsupply chain cycle. The increased complexity of manufacturing supply chains is the main \nobstacle to the efficiency of different solutions for transition from common manufacturing \nsupply chains to green manufacturing supply chains. Therefore, policy makers should try \nto find a process to improve the role of green capacities in the transition progress.  \n\nJasim  and  Paramasivan  (2017)  study  the  problem  of  green  marketing  and  the  green \nsupply chain in Tamilnadu coastal areas.

METHODOLOGY \n\nIn  this  paper,  in  order  to  determine  the  importance  of  various  factors  influencing  \nGB market development in Viet Nam, we employ the AHP method, which has been used \nby numerous scholars as a reliable multiple criteria decision-making tool (Rasoulinezhad \n2009; Jabalameli and Rasoulinezhad 2012). The main purpose of this method is to use \nqualitative data and shape them to quantitative ones. The scale of AHP ranges from 1 to \n9, as shown in Table 1. \n\nRelative \nIntensity \n1 \n3 \n\n5 \n\n7 \n\n9 \n\n2,4,6,8 \n\nTable 2: Scale of AHP for Pairwise Comparison (Saaty 2000) \n\nDefinition \n\nExplanation \n\nOf equal value \nSlightly more value \n\nEssential or strong \nvalue \nVery strong value \n\nExtreme value \n\nIntermediate values \nbetween two adjacent \njudgments \n\nTwo requirements are of equal value \nExperience slightly favors one requirement over \nanother \nExperience strongly favors one requirement over \nanother \nA requirement is strongly favored and its dominance is \ndemonstrated in practice \nThe evidence favoring one requirement over another is \nof the highest possible order of affirmation \nCompromise is needed \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1082 \n \n\nTu, Sarker, and Rasoulinezhad \n\nTo conduct the AHP method, we follow the steps below. \n\n1.

CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS \n\nIn this study, we considered the green bond market developing in Viet Nam. To this end, \nwe used a multi-criteria decision-making method called the analytic hierarchy process to \nevaluate and rank criteria and their associated factors influencing the development of \nGB in Viet Nam. We asked ten East Asia experts from the University of Tehran to do \npairwise comparisons and then analyzed their decisions using Expert Choice software. \n\nThe main concluding remarks from the AHP are as follows. \n\ni.  Among  four  major  criteria\u2014namely  economic,  political,  social  and  cultural,  and \ninfrastructural\u2014infrastructural and economic factors have the most important role \nin developing the GB market in Viet Nam. This finding is in line with Sharma (2001) \nand  Mu,  Phelps,  and  Stotsky  (2013),  who  determine  the  importance  of \ninfrastructural and economic factors on the spread of bonds in an economy. \n\nii.  Regarding the economic criterion, the presence of an efficient monetary policy and \na high GB interest rate are important in developing the GB market in Viet Nam. \nThe importance of interest rate to expanding the GB market is in line with Barr and \nCampbell (1997), Viceira (2012) and De Rezende (2017), while our finding of a \nmajor  role  of  monetary  policy  in  developing  the  bond  market  is  similar  to  the \nfindings  of Nimark  (2008)  and  Marfatia  (2015), who  emphasize  the  effect  of  an \nefficient  monetary  policy  on  establishing  a  stable  finance  atmosphere  in  an \neconomy. \n\niii. \n\nIt  can  be  concluded  that  Viet  Nam\u2019s  government  support  of  the  GB  market  \nis important, among different political factors. This is in line with Voica, Panait, and \nRadulescu  (2015),  who  express  that  governments  have  realized  the  need  for \nadaptation  to  new  climate  conditions.  Therefore,  governments\u2019  efforts  and \ninvestments in green bonds are crucial for GB development. \n\niv.  Social concerns about environmental matters are key to develop the GB market \nin Viet Nam. Environmental concern on the part of society\u2014in other words, social \nenvironmental  responsibility\u2014can  accelerate  the  interest  of  the  population  in \nentering and investing more in the GB market. This conclusion is in line with the \nfindings  of  Li  et  al.  (2017)  and  Trompeter  (2017),  who  find  positive  linkages \nbetween environmental responsibility and financial performance. \n\nv.  Among  infrastructural  factors,  the  legal  framework  and  Viet  Nam\u2019s  international \ncooperation on GB issues are the most important influential factors for GB market \ndevelopment in Viet Nam. A legal framework is an essential requirement to expand \nthe GB market, making a stable and reliable investment climate for investors in \nthis  market.  The  remarkable  correlation  between  the  legal  framework  and  GBs \nhas been expressed in different studies, such as those by Shishlov, Morel, and \nCochran (2016) and Park (2018). \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1082 \n \n\nTu, Sarker, and Rasoulinezhad \n\nvi.  Considering  all  16  influential  factors  related  to  economic,  political,  social  and \ncultural,  and  infrastructural  criteria  revealed  that  the  most  important  influencing \nfactors among are a legal framework for GB operations, monetary policies of Viet \nNam\u2019s  central  bank,  and  the  official  interest  rate  of  GB.  In  other  words, \ninfrastructural and economic factors are more important requirements to develop \nthe  current  GB  market  in  Viet  Nam  than  political  and  social  and  cultural \nrequirements. \n\nOverall, it can be seen that a demand is opening up the potential for vigorously promotion \nof the GB market in Viet Nam. Coordination between public and private, the domestic \nand foreign sectors, and linkage between financial institutions, banks and enterprises, \nand  technology  solution  providers  are  essential  to  maximize  resources  for  the \ndevelopment of a clean  and sustainable economy. In addition to the pilot issuance of \ngreen  local  government  bonds,  the  authorities  should  work  together  to  develop  a \ncomprehensive  plan  to  implement  GB  issuance  in  accordance  with  international \npractices in Viet Nam. Accordingly, there should be a legal document at the level of a \ngovernment  decree  on  the  GB  program  which  stipulates  the  purpose  of  using  capital \nfrom bond issuance, the mechanism of accounting capital from bond issuance, reporting \non the use of capital, and tax policy as a basis for implementation. \n\nGB is not the answer to all issues of sustainable development in Viet Nam; however, GB \nis likely to be a springboard for sustainable development initiatives and solutions. With \nGB,  we  no  longer  have  to  consider  selecting  between  economic  development  and \nenvironmental  protection.  We  can  encourage  businesses,  that  have  the  highest \nemissions  in  the  economy,  to  move  toward  self-mitigating  and  eliminating  negative \nimpacts on the environment while  ensuring their profitability; or local communities will \nhave the opportunity to participate in the economic system, and not only increase their \nincome,  but  also  enjoy  an  improved  quality  of  life.  When  Viet  Nam  builds  itself  a \nprofessional GB market, it will create a new transition in the socio-economic foundation. \nViet  Nam  has  a  lot  of  potential  for  issuing  GB,  but  the  challenges  and  barriers  are \nsignificant.  The  article  has  pointed  out  some  policy  barriers  (the  policy  system  is  not \ncomplete as a legal basis for participation in the market of issuers), including complicated \nand  prolonged  administrative  procedures  in  terms  of  debt  limits  and  issuance  scale \n(small  limit  and  scale),  while  environmental  assessment  and  reporting  have  not  been \nimplemented properly \n\nIn  future  research,  it  is  recommended  to  use  quantitative  methods  to  evaluate  the \nmagnitudes of effects of different variables on the GB market in Viet Nam. Furthermore, \na comparison study between Viet Nam and other cases in which the GM market operates \nis suggested for future research. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1082 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nTu, Sarker, and Rasoulinezhad \n\nAksorn, P., and Ch.

In the last years, the development of GBs has shown that \nthis is an effective investment channel for the purpose of protecting the environment. Viet Nam \nis an Asian economy that has been trying to establish and develop a GB market. The aim of \nthis study is to find out what are the most important factors influencing development of the GB \nmarket in Viet Nam. To this end, we use the analytic hierarchy process to analyze the opinions \nof experts. The main results reveal that the most important influencing factors are the legal \nframework for GB operations, monetary policies of Viet Nam\u2019s central bank, and the official \ninterest rate of GB. In other words, infrastructural and economic factors are the most important \nrequirements  to  develop  the  current  GB  market  in  Viet  Nam.  We  recommend  establishing \ngreen regulations and green economic policies in the country to support the implementation \nof GBs in Viet Nam. \n \nKeywords: sustainable development, green bond, analytic hierarchy process \n \nJEL Classification: N0, N10, O10, O23 \n \n", " \n"]}
