INTRODUCTION \nGreen bonds (GBs) have been widely applied all over the world and are considered a \nfinancial tool to raise capital for projects that benefit the environment (World Bank 2019). \nThe money raised by GB issuance is committed to investment in programs which \nenhance adaptation and lessen the effects of climate change, including projects about \nclean energy, public transport, and clean water.  \nThe GB concept was proposed by the World Bank in the Strategic Framework on \nDevelopment and Climate Change in 2008 as a solution to help countries around the \nworld raise capital for strategies to solve the problem of air pollution and global climate \nchange (Trang 2015). International Capital Market Association in the 2016 report of The \nGreen Bond Principles (GBP) define GBs as any type of bond whose proceeds from \nbond issuance are used to finance different projects related to green energy sources \nwhich are eligible for funding and comply with the four principles of the GBP. Potential \nprojects  can  be  funded  by  GB  mobilization,  according  to  GBP,  including  \n(but not limited to) areas such as green energy sources, intensity of energy in societies, \nwaste disposal, animal conservation, environmentally friendly transport, sustainable \nmanagement  of  natural  resources,  and  projects  related  to  environmental  problem \nadaptation. Generally, GBs are a kind of debt security having a number of common \nbonds characteristics and can help governments to attract capital for projects that benefit \nthe  environment.  According  to  the  definition  by  the  International  Capital  Market \nAssociation (2016), GBs are bonds issued to raise funds for the government, banking, \nand  local  or  issuing  businesses,  labeling  GBs  by  governments  as  debt  securities \nincluding securitization, private issuance, and guaranteed bonds.  \nThe characteristic which separates GBs from other common bonds is that the purpose \nof  GB  mobilization  is  to  fund  special  environment-related  projects,  including \nenvironmental projects and projects with environmental benefits. In addition, because of \nthe purpose of the capital, GBs have a number of special provisions in terms of debt \nrepayment mechanism, and recourse or nonrecourse of issuing organizations. GBs  \nare only different from other types of bond on two basic points: (i) the proceeds after \nsubtracting the costs related to the offering are used to finance or refinance green \nprojects, environmental projects, or projects with environmental benefits; and (ii) there \nare  different  provisions  in  terms  of  debt  repayment  mechanism,  and  recourse  or \nnonrecourse of issuing organizations.  \nGB development is beneficial for bond issuers, investors, and society. With regard  \nto issuers, the issuance of GB in the stock market will help to diversify investors, \nespecially investors who are interested in special aspects such as corporate governance \nand social factors in the process of investing. With regard to investors, GBs will be a \ngood financial asset for investment to help diversify investment portfolios, disperse risks, \nand find appropriate resources. According to the trend that countries are focusing on \nsustainable development and greening the economy, the GB market will constantly \nincrease in terms of both quantity and quality. Therefore, this will be a kind of asset that \nis highly appreciated, stable, and has good liquidity with long maturity. With regard to \nsociety, GBs are also an effective tool to raise investors\u2019 awareness about projects which \ndeal with climate change and environmental pollution. At the same time, the issuance of \nGBs will help to attract large capital flows in society to support the implementation of \nenvironmentally friendly projects and meet social responsibility goals, contributing to \nsustainable development in the future. \n   \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1082  Tu, Sarker, and Rasoulinezhad \n \nAccording to the above advantages of GBs, Viet Nam\u2019s government is trying to develop \nthis kind of bond in the country. The purpose here is to ascertain what factors can impact \non GB market development in Viet Nam. This will be investigated using the analytic \nhierarchy process (AHP), a method that enables us to gather different experts\u2019 opinions, \nanalyze, and rank factors influencing GB market development in Viet Nam. \nBased on the freshness of the green bond issue in academic sectors and the knowledge \nof the authors, there has been no serious academic study focusing on analyzing different \nfactors influencing GB market development, particularly in Viet Nam via a multi-criteria \ndecision-making model. This gap is filled by the novelty of our research. \nThe structure of the rest of the paper is as follows. Section 2 offers a brief literature \nreview. In Section 3, a number of earlier empirical studies are represented. Section 4 \npresents the research methodology. In Section 5, the results of the AHP are stated. We \nconclude the paper in Section 6. \n2.  LITERATURE REVIEW \n2.1  The Green Bond Market in Southeast Asian Countries \nThe  Association  of  Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN),  with  an  economic  size  of  \n$2.57 trillion in 2016, is one of the largest economic groups in the world. The GB market \nin ASEAN has developed rapidly, indicating the expanded role of this kind of bond in the \nfinancial  markets  of  ASEAN.  The  following  Table  1  represents  the  GB  issuance \ncharacteristics in 2018. \nTable 1: GB Issuance in ASEAN Countries \nShare of GB Market in  Value of Total \nFinancial Markets   Number of  Issued GB  \nGroup of Countries  (%)  GB Issuers  ($ billion) \nASEAN  6  19  5 \nAsia and the Pacific (APAC)  17  206  108 \nASEAN share of APAC  35  9  5 \nASEAN share of global  11  3  1 \nSource: Authors\u2019 compilation from https://www.climatebonds.net/. \nHistorically, issuance of GB was started by development banks in 2007\u20132008 in order to \nexpand the financing of projects related to emissions reduction projects. Asia and the \nPacific\u2019s GB issuers began their activities in the market in 2013, and in recent years their \ncontribution to world GB issuance has been nearly 22%.  \nIn recent years, there has been vast diversification in the GB market in ASEAN, and in \n2016 Asia Pacific Renewables was ranked first among GB issuers in the region, with \nnearly $226 million of GB. This top ranking of ASEAN GB issuers is a guarantee of their \nefficient work and activities in local, regional and global financial markets.  \nGB  issuers  from  Singapore  and  Malaysia  entered  the  market  in  2017,  expanding  \nthe financial turnover in the GB market. In addition, GB issuers from Indonesia and \nThailand joined this market in first and second quarters of 2018, respectively. Indonesia\u2019s \nissue of $1.25 billion of green Sukuk bonds in 2018 was significant in this country \nbecoming the fifth most influential nation in the GB market. Interestingly, the major GB \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1082  Tu, Sarker, and Rasoulinezhad \n \nissuers are non-financial institutions in the region, owning nearly 30% of the total GBs \nissued in this region. Moreover, green loans (GLs) are an important complementary part \nof GB (for instance, GLs are common among Singaporean real estate companies), being \na major feature of the ASEAN bond market. The issue volume of GLs in ASEAN is $1.1 \nbillion which is equal to approximately 22% of the aggregate transactions volume in the \nregion. \nIn regard to the question of which country contributes more to the ASEAN GB market, \nIndonesia (TLFF I is the largest GB issuer of this country) is the first contributor and \nprovides nearly 40% of total GB issuance in ASEAN. The second and third contributors \nare Singapore (the only GB issuer being Sindicatum Renewable Energy Company) and \nMalaysia, with shares of 35% and 19%, respectively. \nThe next important GB issuers in the region are Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \nDespite major contributions of different members of ASEAN, it is clear that the number \nof GB issuers in the region is quite a few.  \nOverall, it is clear that GB issuing has attracted the attention of financial sectors in \nASEAN and has developed rapidly in the last decade. It seems that the ASEAN region \ncan be considered one of the main GB markets in the world, where the issuance and use \nof GBs have a significant share in total bond markets. \n2.2  The Green Bond Market in Viet Nam \nThe province of Ba Ria-Vung Tau and Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City) are the first two places \nin Viet Nam where the Vietnamese Dong (VND)-denominated GBs are represented on \nthe Hanoi Stock Exchange. In Viet Nam, climate change has increased the level and the \ncycle of natural disasters such as droughts, floods, and sea level rise, seriously affecting \nthe  socio-economic  development  and  people\u2019s  lives.  Research  by  international \norganizations  also  indicates  that  climate  change  could  cost  Viet  Nam  \n$15 billion per year, equivalent to 5% of GDP. Vietnamese authorities also estimate that \neach one-meter rise in the sea level will affect the lives of about 20% of the population. \nFlooding and saline intrusion due to sea level rise will narrow the area of agricultural land \nin  both  the  Red  River  Delta  and  the  Mekong  River  Delta.  Industries  \nwill also be affected because of a shortage of raw materials and energy, leading to higher \nproduction costs. In this context, Viet Nam determines that green growth is an important \nstrategy for sustainable development. Pursuant to Resolution No 24-NQ/TW of 3 June \n2013 of the 11th Central Committee about being active in response to climate change, \nimprovement of natural resource management, and environmental protection, on 20 \nOctober 2015, the Minister of Finance issued Decision 2183/QD-BTC approving the road \nmap of the financial sector in Viet Nam to conduct the national strategy on green growth \ntoward 2020. Accordingly, the Decision clearly stated the formulation and improvement \nof the financial policy framework to develop the green capital market and green financial \nproducts. Green capital market policies include setting up a green financial framework \nfor activities on the capital market such as issuing regulations and conditions for stock \nlisting (green listing), reporting (sustainable reporting), and monitoring (green financial \ncriteria); mobilizing funds to invest in green growth through capital markets for green \nbusinesses, projects, and products through listing and issuing green stocks; issuing \nbonds and investment certificates for green projects, programs, and fields; developing \ngreen indicators for monitoring, evaluating, and trading on capital markets; issuing \nregulations or guidelines on environmental and social risk management for market \norganizations  and  for  market  members  who  are  financial  institutions  and  listed \nbusinesses. \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1082  Tu, Sarker, and Rasoulinezhad \n \nAfter a period of application, the GB concept was officially recognized in 2018 in Item 1, \nArticle 21, Decree 95/2018/ND-CP. Accordingly, \u201cGreen bonds are government bonds \nissued  for  raising  funds  for  environmental  projects  as  defined  in  the  Law  on \nenvironmental protection (also called green projects) and included in the list of projects \nto which public investment funds are allocated in accordance with the Law on public \ninvestment and the Law on state budget.\u201d Defined GB products include: (i) green \ncorporate bonds, issued for green projects or green products; and (2) government bonds \nand  local  government  bonds,  issued  for  green  goals,  programs,  and  projects.  \nIn order to develop an open bond market and approach international standards, on  \n14  August  2017,  the  Prime  Minister  issued  Decision  No.  1191/QD-TTg  approving  \nthe bond market development road map during 2017\u20132020, as a long-run approach \ntoward 2030. Accordingly, the decision sets out the development viewpoints: develop the \nbond  market  both  extensively  and  intensively,  ensuring  systemic  safety,  gradually \napproaching  international  practices  and  standards  and  modernizing  the  market\u2019s \ninfrastructure, thus turning it into a crucial channel for raising medium- and long-term \ncapital at reasonable capital costs; continue focusing on expanding the government bond \nmarket  as  a  useful  tool  to  grow  the  bond  market;  and  further  develop  \nthe corporate bond market to create favorable conditions for enterprises to raise capital, \nespecially medium- and long-term capital, thereby enhancing their corporate governance \nand information disclosure. The objectives are that the outstanding balance of the bond \nmarket will reach around 45% of GDP by 2020 and 65% of GDP by 2030, and the \noutstanding balance of the market of corporate bonds will reach about 7% of GDP by \n2020 and around 20% of GDP by 2030. The Ministry of Finance shall assume prime \nresponsibility; the State Bank of Viet Nam shall coordinate with the Ministry of Planning \nand Investment to promulgate mechanisms and policies aiming to develop the GB \nmarket to create favorable conditions for issuing entities to mobilize capital through bond \nissuance to implement green projects. The policy of sustainable and environmentally \nfriendly  economic  development  was  guided  by  the  Party  and  \nthe Government in Resolution No 24-NQ/TW, dated 3 June 2013 of the 11th Central \nCommittee;  Decision  No.  1393/QD-TTg,  dated  25  September  2012  approving  the \nnational strategy on green growth; Decision No. 403/QD-TTg, dated 20 March 2014 on \napproval of the National Action Plan on green growth in Viet Nam for the period of 2014\u2013\n2020; and Decision No. 2053/QD-TTg, dated 28 October 2016, promulgating the action \nplan for implementing the Paris Agreement to combat CO emissions. \n2 \nIn Decision No. 1191/QD-TTg, dated 14 August 2017, explaining the road map of bond \nmarket expansion over the period of 2017\u20132020 as a main part of the long-run approach \nof  2030,  the  Prime  Minister  assigned  the  task  of  developing  the  GB  market  \nto create favorable conditions for issuing entities to mobilize capital through bond \nissuance  to  implement  green  projects.  Implementing  the  party  and  government \nguidelines in the above documents, the draft Decree states that GBs are a type of \ngovernment bond, complying with the issuance process of government debt tools for the \npurpose of using the capital from GB issuance for green projects; every year the issuer \nhas to report the use of capital for green projects and assess the environmental impacts. \nOn 6 August 2015, the Governor of the State Bank of Viet Nam issued Decision No. \n1552/QD-NHNN on issuance of the banking sector\u2019s action plan to implement the \nnational strategy on green growth toward 2020. However, for a developing country like \nViet Nam, the national budget is still tight and the support of international organizations \nis limited, and so the active participation of the financial system in the greening campaign \nof the economy plays a very important role. According to the United Nations Environment \nProgramme (UNEP 2016), an eco-friendly economy (green economy) is an economy \naimed at improving people\u2019s happiness and social justice, and significantly reducing the \nrisk of environmental degradation. A green economy is an economy where people are \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1082  Tu, Sarker, and Rasoulinezhad \n \nthe center and policies create new resources, such as the Financial Monetary Market \nPolicy,  dated  \n24  August  2016,  on  sustainable  and  equal  economic  growth.  Green  growth  is  a \ndevelopment model that focuses on improving the quality of growth, changing the \nproduction structure and consumption in a sustainable way, and improving people\u2019s lives, \ncombating carbon emissions and raising adaptability to the threat of global warming \n(UNEP 2016). \n3.  EMPIRICAL STUDIES \nFinding an efficient solution to the problem of global warming and air pollution has \nattracted the wide attention of scholars. Using new financial tools is proposed as a way \nto move and shift from the current position to a better eco-friendly (green) economy. \nMonasterolo and Raberto (2018) discuss that fiscal and monetary policies can present a \nnew financial tool to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. Using a developed flow-of-\nfunds behavioral model they determine the significant impact of the investment of \ncompanies on the brown and eco-friendly sectors, on the unemployment rate in society, \nand on credit and bond markets. They conclude that green public policy is an appropriate \nway to ensure green growth by affecting the activities of credit markets.  \nAccording to the study by Wang and Zhi (2016), green finance is a fresh financial method \nfor  connecting  environmental  goals  with  economic  growth.  The  authors  \nstudy the current status of green finance in the field of renewable energy and find  \nsome shortcomings, proposing some solutions for market mechanism development and \npolicy  formulation.  Showing  the  internal  conflicts  between  green  finance  and \nenvironmental protection, the authors propose practical solutions to achieve a better \necological balance. \nCatalin Voica, Panait, and Alin Haralambie (2015) believe that climate change has \nnegative impacts to a large extent on the activities of economic actors. Gradually, \ncompanies and public institutions have recognized the need to adapt to new climate \nconditions,  leading  to  the  adoption  of  environmentally  friendly  behaviors  and  the \npromotion of socially responsible strategies. The authors evaluate the role of private \ninvestors and public agencies in green investment, mainly in the infrastructure and the \ngovernment, creating the legal and institutional framework to encourage direct investors \nand portfolios in this area. \nAccording to Flaherty et al. (2017), funding projects related to the mitigation of carbon \ndioxide and adopting various policies is an important program in the current decade. The \nauthors state that a vast number of eco-friendly projects have failed due to lack of \nfinancing. Hence, strengthening green projects\u2019 financing would be a useful way to \nconduct efficient policies.  \nSachs  (2014)  proposes  sharing  the  interdisciplinary  burden,  showing  that  the \nimplementation  of  climate  policies  has  a  positive  relationship  with  the  Pareto \nimprovement strategy in both the short and long run. According to the author, the GB \nproposal represents an opportunity that can be carried out immediately to begin the \nSachs plan: GB issuance can finance essential projects in decarbonizing so that debt \ncan be paid through long-run programs. Since future generations will benefit from \nlowering the threat of climate change, they are a better candidate to pay the debt.  \nMegwai, Njie, and Richards (2016) investigate the role of national strategies and policies \nin green economic improvement in selected developing countries. The major findings of \nthe study reveal that there are specific dissimilarities in national strategies from country \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1082  Tu, Sarker, and Rasoulinezhad \n \nto country for reasons such as level of development, institutional capacity, government \nmanagement,  and  the  efficiency  of  production  inputs.  The  authors  recommend \nconducting  the  \u20186Is\u2019  policy  in  some  selected  UN  member  states,  namely  Croatia, \nEthiopia, Kenya, Thailand, and Guyana.  \nAksorn and Charoenngam (2016) attempt to analyze life cycle management through the \nprocess of community infrastructure development by applying a triangulation technique \nin the case of Thailand. They find that establishing a green finance infrastructure is a \nmajor key to develop green economy aspects in Thailand. \nRoutroy and Kumar (2016) focus on the green capability to improve the manufacturing \nsupply chain cycle. The increased complexity of manufacturing supply chains is the main \nobstacle to the efficiency of different solutions for transition from common manufacturing \nsupply chains to green manufacturing supply chains. Therefore, policy makers should try \nto find a process to improve the role of green capacities in the transition progress.  \nJasim and Paramasivan (2017) study the problem of green marketing and the green \nsupply chain in Tamilnadu coastal areas. They find that the most important reason for a \nlack of development in green marketing and the green supply chain in the areas is \ninfrastructure, which can be improved by funding green projects. \nBekhet and Harun (2018) examine the causal relationship between renewable electricity \ngeneration and some macroeconomic variables in Malaysia over the period 1980\u20132016. \nTheir  findings  show  a  long-run  relationship  running  from  labor  and  \nnon-renewable electricity generation to renewable electricity generation. Furthermore, \nthey  find  the  negative short-run  effect  of capital,  GDP,  and  financial  development  \non  renewable  electricity  generation.  The  study  concludes  that  in  Malaysia,  it  is \nrecommended to improve the progress of sustainable energy security by managing the \ndeterminants influencing renewable electricity generation. \n4.  METHODOLOGY \nIn  this  paper,  in  order  to  determine  the  importance  of  various  factors  influencing  \nGB market development in Viet Nam, we employ the AHP method, which has been used \nby numerous scholars as a reliable multiple criteria decision-making tool (Rasoulinezhad \n2009; Jabalameli and Rasoulinezhad 2012). The main purpose of this method is to use \nqualitative data and shape them to quantitative ones. The scale of AHP ranges from 1 to \n9, as shown in Table 1. \nTable 2: Scale of AHP for Pairwise Comparison (Saaty 2000) \nRelative  Definition  Explanation \nIntensity \n1  Of equal value  Two requirements are of equal value \n3  Slightly more value  Experience slightly favors one requirement over \nanother \n5  Essential or strong  Experience strongly favors one requirement over \nvalue  another \n7  Very strong value  A requirement is strongly favored and its dominance is \ndemonstrated in practice \n9  Extreme value  The evidence favoring one requirement over another is \nof the highest possible order of affirmation \n2,4,6,8  Intermediate values  Compromise is needed \nbetween two adjacent \njudgments \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1082  Tu, Sarker, and Rasoulinezhad \n \nTo conduct the AHP method, we follow the steps below. \n1.

CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS \nIn this study, we considered the green bond market developing in Viet Nam. To this end, \nwe used a multi-criteria decision-making method called the analytic hierarchy process to \nevaluate and rank criteria and their associated factors influencing the development of \nGB in Viet Nam. We asked ten East Asia experts from the University of Tehran to do \npairwise comparisons and then analyzed their decisions using Expert Choice software. \nThe main concluding remarks from the AHP are as follows. \ni.  Among four major criteria\u2014namely economic, political, social and cultural, and \ninfrastructural\u2014infrastructural and economic factors have the most important role \nin developing the GB market in Viet Nam. This finding is in line with Sharma (2001) \nand  Mu,  Phelps,  and  Stotsky  (2013),  who  determine  the  importance  of \ninfrastructural and economic factors on the spread of bonds in an economy. \nii.  Regarding the economic criterion, the presence of an efficient monetary policy and \na high GB interest rate are important in developing the GB market in Viet Nam. \nThe importance of interest rate to expanding the GB market is in line with Barr and \nCampbell (1997), Viceira (2012) and De Rezende (2017), while our finding of a \nmajor role of monetary policy in developing the bond market is similar to the \nfindings of Nimark (2008) and Marfatia (2015), who emphasize the effect of an \nefficient  monetary  policy  on  establishing  a  stable  finance  atmosphere  in  an \neconomy. \niii.  It can be concluded that Viet Nam\u2019s government support of the GB market  \nis important, among different political factors. This is in line with Voica, Panait, and \nRadulescu (2015), who express that governments have realized the need for \nadaptation  to  new  climate  conditions.  Therefore,  governments\u2019  efforts  and \ninvestments in green bonds are crucial for GB development. \niv.  Social concerns about environmental matters are key to develop the GB market \nin Viet Nam. Environmental concern on the part of society\u2014in other words, social \nenvironmental responsibility\u2014can accelerate the interest of the population in \nentering and investing more in the GB market. This conclusion is in line with the \nfindings of Li et al. (2017) and Trompeter (2017), who find positive linkages \nbetween environmental responsibility and financial performance. \nv.  Among infrastructural factors, the legal framework and Viet Nam\u2019s international \ncooperation on GB issues are the most important influential factors for GB market \ndevelopment in Viet Nam. A legal framework is an essential requirement to expand \nthe GB market, making a stable and reliable investment climate for investors in \nthis market. The remarkable correlation between the legal framework and GBs \nhas been expressed in different studies, such as those by Shishlov, Morel, and \nCochran (2016) and Park (2018). \n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1082  Tu, Sarker, and Rasoulinezhad \n \nvi.  Considering all 16 influential factors related to economic, political, social and \ncultural, and infrastructural criteria revealed that the most important influencing \nfactors among are a legal framework for GB operations, monetary policies of Viet \nNam\u2019s  central  bank,  and  the  official  interest  rate  of  GB.  In  other  words, \ninfrastructural and economic factors are more important requirements to develop \nthe  current  GB  market  in  Viet  Nam  than  political  and  social  and  cultural \nrequirements. \nOverall, it can be seen that a demand is opening up the potential for vigorously promotion \nof the GB market in Viet Nam. Coordination between public and private, the domestic \nand foreign sectors, and linkage between financial institutions, banks and enterprises, \nand  technology  solution  providers  are  essential  to  maximize  resources  for  the \ndevelopment of a clean and sustainable economy. In addition to the pilot issuance of \ngreen  local  government  bonds,  the  authorities  should  work  together  to  develop  a \ncomprehensive  plan  to  implement  GB  issuance  in  accordance  with  international \npractices in Viet Nam. Accordingly, there should be a legal document at the level of a \ngovernment decree on the GB program which stipulates the purpose of using capital \nfrom bond issuance, the mechanism of accounting capital from bond issuance, reporting \non the use of capital, and tax policy as a basis for implementation. \nGB is not the answer to all issues of sustainable development in Viet Nam; however, GB \nis likely to be a springboard for sustainable development initiatives and solutions. With \nGB, we no longer have to consider selecting between economic development and \nenvironmental  protection.  We  can  encourage  businesses,  that  have  the  highest \nemissions in the economy, to move toward self-mitigating and eliminating negative \nimpacts on the environment while ensuring their profitability; or local communities will \nhave the opportunity to participate in the economic system, and not only increase their \nincome, but also enjoy an improved quality of life. When Viet Nam builds itself a \nprofessional GB market, it will create a new transition in the socio-economic foundation. \nViet Nam has a lot of potential for issuing GB, but the challenges and barriers are \nsignificant. The article has pointed out some policy barriers (the policy system is not \ncomplete as a legal basis for participation in the market of issuers), including complicated \nand prolonged administrative procedures in terms of debt limits and issuance scale \n(small limit and scale), while environmental assessment and reporting have not been \nimplemented properly \nIn future research, it is recommended to use quantitative methods to evaluate the \nmagnitudes of effects of different variables on the GB market in Viet Nam. Furthermore, \na comparison study between Viet Nam and other cases in which the GM market operates \nis suggested for future research. \n \n   \n12 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1082  Tu, Sarker, and Rasoulinezhad \n \nREFERENCES \nAksorn, P., and Ch.
