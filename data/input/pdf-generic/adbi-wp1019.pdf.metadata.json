Value chains that have \ntheir potential developed further are the cashmere, tourism, fruit, and berry sectors. Key \nfactors in the development of SMEs in Mongolia are discussed along with factors hindering \ntheir development. There is no unified database on SMEs and different organizations are \nresponsible for gathering data on them. Thus the statistics on SMEs are inconsistent and \nfragmented. Therefore, it is difficult to present a clear picture of SMEs and make sound policies \nbased on reliable, coherent analysis and data in favor of SMEs. Due to the sparse population, \ntraditional banking services are costly, especially outside of the residential areas. A lack of \nsound credit infrastructure and governmental regulations are the main problems in the credit \nmarket for SMEs.

INTRODUCTION \nMongolia transitioned to a market economy in 1990 and became one of the fastest-\ngrowing economies due to the double-digit growth for three consecutive years in early \n2010. With the slowdown of commodity prices the economic growth started to decline. \nThe latest reports from the NSO and the World Bank show that the poverty rate is 35.5% \nin the countryside, compared to 23.2% in urban areas. \nAdministratively, Mongolia is divided into 21 aimags and the capital city of Ulaanbaatar, \nwhich is not part of a province. While up to 65% of GDP is produced in Ulaanbaatar city \nand 10% is produced in Orkhon province where the Erdenet Mining Corporation has \nbeen active since 1978, the remaining 25% is divided amongst the other 20 provinces. \nGDP  per  capita  is  three  times  lower  in  the  countryside  than  in  \nthe  city.  There  is  a  lower  level  of  job  opportunity  and  the  business  environment  \nis unfavorable, due to poor infrastructure and low market potential, amongst other \nproblems. \nThe  research  question  of  this  paper  is:  \u201cAre  business  environment  and  financing \nmechanisms favorable for SMEs?\u201d \n1.1  Analytical Framework \nSMEs are the main drivers of an economy because they create most of the jobs and \ncontribute to reducing poverty and inclusive economic growth. Thus, support of SMEs \nthrough  effective  policies  and  financing  mechanisms  remains  the  primary  goal  of \ncountries across the world. Today, SMEs in developing countries are facing many \ndifficulties. The objective of this paper is to identify the bottlenecks and drivers of \neconomic growth as well as value chains with high growth potential.  \nIn general, the share of SMEs in GDP, business environment, financing mechanisms, \ngovernment policies, and inclusion of SMEs in the value chain of a country are the \nimportant factors that have to be studied.  \n2.  ECONOMIC SITUATION \nMongolia is landlocked and one of the world\u2019s most sparsely populated countries. The \neconomic growth of Mongolia was very volatile in the last decade. Due to large projects \nin mining and infrastructure, the economic growth of Mongolia in the period from 2010 to \n2014 was high. A sharp slowdown of growth occurred when the commodity prices fell in \n2016,  which  highlighted  again  the  need  for  economic  diversification  and  high \ndependency on mining. In recent years, migration in Mongolia has continued the trend \nof rural to urban flows, particularly in Ulaanbaatar. The present urban population is above \n1.3 million or almost half of the population of Mongolia. Despite significant economic \nopportunities, poverty and inequality continue to be serious problems and inequalities \nare widening between regions and between rural and urban areas.  \nThe main driver of economic growth is mining and quarrying (24.5% of GDP as of 2017), \nwhile the second largest sector is wholesale and retail (15.7% of GDP as of 2017), \nfollowed  by  agriculture  (10.2%  of  GDP  as  of  2017)  and  manufacturing  (10.5%  \nof GDP as of 2017). The real estate sector makes up 6.0% of GDP, financial and \ninsurance activities 5.1%, transportation and storage 4.8%, and construction 4.1% as of \n2017 (Figure 1). \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1019  L. Boojoo \n \nFigure 1: GDP Breakdown by Sectors \n \nSource: NSO (2019a). \nAccording to the statistical information from the General Taxation Department, there are \n78,585 legal entities active in Mongolia. Almost 70% of enterprises are located in \nUlaanbaatar, and about 86% or 67,612 of those are SMEs.  \nThe SME Law was first introduced in 2007 in which SMEs are defined as legally \nregistered business entities with 199 or fewer employees with an annual turnover of up \nto MNT1.5 billion (approx. $833,000), and the sectors in which they are active are also \ndefined (Table 1). \nTable 1: Definition of SMEs in Mongolia \nEnterprise  Number of  Annual Turnover  \nCategory  Sector  Employees  in MNT \nSmall  All sectors  \u2264 19 employees  \u2264 MNT250 million \n  Services  \u2264 49 employees  \u2264 MNT1.0 billion \nMedium-sized  Wholesale  \u2264 149 employees  \u2264 MNT1.5 billion \n  Retail/Manufacturing  \u2264 199 employees  \u2264 MNT1.5 billion \nSource: SME Law of Mongolia (2007). \nThe National Statistical Office (NSO) uses different employee number categorization for \nthe business register database and commercial banks use different definitions for their \nclient segmentation.  \nThe business register of the NSO divides enterprises according to the number of \nemployees they have (Table 2).

The \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1019  L. Boojoo \n \nnext biggest group of enterprises are active in other communities, social and personal \nservice activities, the processing industry, and construction.  \nMost of the employment in the agriculture, forestry, hunting and fishing, and construction \nsectors  is  seasonal  and  informal.  Therefore,  the  numbers  shown  in  \nTable 3 are not the exact numbers, but only a small subset of them. Also, the samples \nhave to be defined carefully.  \nAccording  to  Zolzaya  and  Zhou  (2018),  at  the  end  of  2017,  in  total  141,500 \nestablishments were registered at the NSO and 75,700 of these were active. Ca. 77% of \nthese active establishments are SMEs and they account for 17.8% of the total GDP and \n2.3% of the exports. Some 70% of the economically active population are employed in \nSMEs, while the Ministry of Agriculture and Light Industry reports that there are about \n760,000 people employed in SMEs, which makes up 69% of the total employment. \nAvailable statistics on SMEs are inconsistent and fragmented, due to the lack of a unified \ndatabase on SMEs. \n2.1   Mongolia\u2019s Financial Situation \nAfter high economic growth years in 2012\u20122013, the economy faced serious problems \nin 2015 when the GDP growth declined to 2.5% and was only 1.6% in 2016. Along with \nthe economic boom starting in 2012, government debt also started to rise. In 2015, \nMongolia\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio was 62% and at the end of 2016 it had reached 93%. \nAfter the elections of 2016, the new government started negotiating with the IMF, and in \n2017, they reached an agreement. Under the Extended Fund Facility program, the IMF \nand other development partners started providing financial support with $5.5 billion \npackages. The EFF of the IMF is a three-year program and will end in 2019. \nIn order to stabilize the economy in the short term and restructure it in the medium term, \nthe government of Mongolia has undertaken various policies and reform measures under \nthe terms of the agreement. These measures, which have to be taken, are strengthening \nthe fiscal policy to reduce the vulnerability of the boom and bust cycles of the economy \nand strengthening the financial sector and monetary policy (UNDP 2018). \nThe macroeconomic environment in Mongolia is not conducive to the development of the \nmanufacturing industry. The real exchange rate has been rising over the last 10 years, \ndepreciating the Mongolian tugrik against major currencies. These relative exchange rate \nmovements have widened Mongolia\u2019s cost disadvantage.  \nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, external debt in Mongolia increased to $28.7 billion, \nreaching an all-time highest debt amount. The large amount of money that has to be \nrepaid will negatively affect the economy, depleting the resources covering critical \ngovernment services, including health, social welfare, and education along with financing \nof SMEs. \n2.2  Financial Infrastructure \nMongolia is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world, which makes \ntraditional  banking  outside  of  settlements  difficult  and  costly.  The  financial  sector  \nof Mongolia is dominated by banks, which make up about 96%. There are currently  \n14 commercial banks in Mongolia. The commercial banks of Mongolia have the biggest \ninfrastructure in the country, with Khan Bank and the State Bank having the biggest \nnetworks. Financial and insurance activities (MNT1.67 trillion) contributed 5.2% of GDP \n(MNT32.2 trillion) in 2018 at current prices. \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1019  L.

They \nprovide a variety of financial services but most of them are located in Ulaanbaatar and \nonly a few of them are active in rural areas.  \nAccording to the FRC, there are about 400 saving and credit cooperatives (SCCs) \nregistered in Mongolia, but only 289 are active. In Ulaanbaatar, there are 186, and in \nrural areas, there are 103 active. The SCCs have about 61,000 members and less than \na 0.5% share in Mongolia\u2019s financial sector.  \nThe total number of outstanding loans issued by banks to SMEs in the last three years \nwas between MNT2.01 trillion and MNT3 trillion, about 17%\u201319% of total loans. That \nmeans that the number of SME loans hasn\u2019t increased dramatically over the last three \nyears. The average interest rate in the last three years was between 17.9% and 19.9%.  \nFigure 2 shows the loans of individuals issued in different sectors, taken for business \npurposes.

Within this initiative, Mongolia has signed up \nto the Partnership for Action on Green Economy (PAGE). With the implementation of the \nPAGE  project  in  Mongolia,  different  green  initiatives  were  started.  The  Green \nDevelopment Policy was adopted by the Parliament on 13 June 2014, which defines \ngreen  development  goals,  objectives,  and  their  implementation  policy  divided  into \nmedium and long term. Mongolian government agencies, industry players, and financial \ninstitutions met in May 2013 at the first Mongolian Sustainable Finance Forum in \nUlaanbaatar to discuss how they can work together towards a green civilization for \nMongolia (Mongolia Bank Association 2019). This forum has become an annual event \nwhere  all  major  stakeholders  of  the  Mongolian  banking  industry,  including  all  14 \nMongolian  banks,  the  Mongolian  Bankers  Association,  the  Banking  and  Finance \nAcademy, and government agencies like the Bank of Mongolia and the Ministry of \nEnvironment and Tourism, come together to discuss offering sustainable finance. At the \nfirst forum, the Mongolian banks declared they would jointly develop the Mongolian \nSustainable Finance Principles.  \nOnly XacBank of Mongolia received an accreditation from the Green Climate Fund,  \non 14 October 2016 (XacBank 2016). On 11 May 2017, they received a $20 million \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1019  L. Boojoo \n \nfinancing package. In the first phase, $500,000 was granted to support micro, small, and \nmedium-sized enterprises finance low-carbon initiatives.1 \n \nThe EBRD and Green Climate Fund cofinanced a program to deliver climate finance \nthrough Partner Financial Institutions in developing countries. The focus of the program \nwill be in the areas of energy efficiency, renewable energy, and climate resilience (Green \nClimate Fund 2017). \nKhan Bank and XacBank are the two banks specialized in micro and rural lending. \nAnother financial intermediary that are offering microfinance and are not supervised are \npawnshops. Their regulation is covered in different laws, but a special regulation for them \ndoes not exist. Therefore, exact numbers or statistics are not available. It is estimated \nthat about 1,500 pawnshops are active and about 350 of them are in Ulaanbaatar. The \nitems that are used as collateral are mostly movable property and are not registered in \na unified database. The interest rates are between 3.5% and 15% per week. Many \nproblems  occur  regarding  lending  since  pawnshop  operations  are  \nnot sufficiently regulated. For instance, when pawnshops sell personal property, which \nhas been used as collateral, at a higher price, they don\u2019t return the change to the lenders. \nTherefore, the responsibility of pawnshops should be increased, and in order to do so, \nmore regulations and a unified database, which registers movable property, are required.  \nIn recent years, microlending possibilities via mobile phone have been developed and \nbecome more accessible. Now it has become possible to lend up to MNT2 million \nimmediately  using  a  mobile  phone.  For  instance,  the  application  LEND  can  be \ndownloaded on a smartphone and offers such loans.  \nDiversified  financing  mechanisms  are  not  available  for  SMEs.  Other  financing \npossibilities  like  venture  capital,  mezzanine  capital,  angels,  crowdfunding,  and \ncrowdlending do not exist.  \n3.  STATUS OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION FOR SMES \nIndividuals and businesses are able to open an account at a bank and obtain affordable \nfinancial products and services. The banks offer a full range of banking products, such \nas transactions, payments, saving, credit, and insurance. According to the latest 2017 \nGlobal Findex survey of the World Bank, about 93% of the adults in Mongolia have an \naccount. Since most payment services, including salaries, pensions, social welfare, \npayments,  and  remittances,  are  distributed  through  Khan  Bank,  \nalmost every Mongolian citizen has a Khan Bank account. The Mongolian Bankers \nAssociation has stated that Khan Bank has provided its banking services to 2.4 million \ncustomers and had 1.7 million card owners and 53,000 corporate customers in 2017 \n(Khan Bank 2019). \nIn recent years, the number of mobile phone users has grown fast, which has made \nInternet banking, especially mobile banking users, grow steadily. Figure 4 shows that the \nnumber of Internet banking users almost tripled and the number of mobile banking users \ndoubled from 2015 to 2017. \nBanks are the main source of funding, but there are also support schemes from the \ngovernment and IFIs available. The Bank of Mongolia publishes an annual survey,  \nthe \u201cDevelopment of SMEs and their financial situation\u201d report, conducted among micro-\n \n1  Green Climate Fund (2017). \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1019  L.

The  objective  of  the  study  is  to  identify  the  development, \noperations, and financing situation, and financing issues and challenges faced by SMEs \nfor  policymakers.  According  to  the  Bank  of  Mongolia,  there  are  75,796  SMEs  \nin Mongolia, with 48,519 in Ulaanbaatar and 27,277 in other provinces. According to the \nBank of Mongolia, 56% of SMEs have used an external financing instrument for their \nbusiness  expansion.  Among  those  enterprises,  81%  have  obtained  loans  from \ncommercial  banks,  while  NBFI  loans  and  subsidized  loans  were  among  the  less \nfrequently used financial sources at 7% and 6%, respectively (Figure 5). Also, 4% of \nSMEs use informal financial sources such as borrowing from family and friends.  \nFigure 4: Active Internet and Mobile Banking Users \n \nSource: Bank of Mongolia (2019). \nFigure 5: SME Financing Sources  \n(%) \n \nSource: Bank of Mongolia (2017). \nThe latest report of 2017 shows that SMEs get 53.7% of their financial support from \nbanks, 32.8% from another source of funding, 15.3% from local government or provincial \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1019  L.

FINANCIAL KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS  \nOF SME ENTREPRENEURS \n4.1  Assessments of Financial Literacy  \nThere are different research reports available on SMEs, but not specifically on financial \nliteracy.

There are also no figures available regarding how many SMEs \nhave taken up such training.  \n4.2  Financial Literacy Programs \nThe Bank of Mongolia, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Education, Culture  \nand Sport, the Financial Regulatory Commission, the Mongolian Banks Association, the \nMongolian  Insurers  Association,  the  Savings  Insurance  Corporation,  nonstate \norganizations operating in the financial sector, and relevant associations and universities \nhave developed a program with the technical support of the World Bank\u2019s National \nmidterm program 2016\u20122021 for financial literacy. The program focuses on four areas:  \n\u2022  a financial literacy program for school children  \n\u2022  financial education for young people  \n\u2022  financial education for rural residents  \n\u2022  financial  education  through  mass  communication/media  (Bank  of  Mongolia \n2016). \n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1019  L.

No assessment \nhas been carried out. SMEs are not part of this program.  \n5.  BARRIERS TO SME FINANCE \nThe biggest challenge SMEs are facing is that financial institutions that offer finance  \nto SMEs cannot offer long-term financing and the interest rates are very high. The \nmaximum maturity is 48 months and the average interest rate is 1.5%\u20132.5% per month. \nAs usual, if an entrepreneur is applying for a loan for the first time, the maximum maturity \ntime is 24 months and the interest rate is the highest. If they have repaid the first loan in \ntime and they apply for a second time they get more favorable conditions.  \nMost SMEs lack collateral. According OECD (2016), collateral requirements are overly \ndemanding, with the average amount reaching close to 200% of the value of loans in \n99.7% of cases, which reflects the deep distrust shown by financial institutions.  \nSMEs can\u2019t apply for SME funding from the SME Development Fund when they need it. \nThey have to wait until the SME fund is announced. A committee decides which SMEs \nwill get the funding after they receive the projects. The funding of the projects selected \nwill be transferred directly to their bank accounts. The funds have not been used properly \nsince  the  project  selection  process  has  not  been  transparent.  Also,  the  tender \nannouncement dates have also been unclear. The standing committee of the Parliament \nis changing the procurement process after some members of parliament misused the \nfunding and approved funding for their own companies.  \nAccess to finance is not sufficient for SMEs. In terms of access to finance, the financial \nproducts available are also insufficient. The main source of funding for SMEs are \ncommercial banks, however there is no competition among the banks. The amount of \nloan, collateral, maturity time, and interest rate offered to SMEs by the banks are similar \nand show no significant difference.  \nThe mandatory social payments in Mongolia are relatively high. The basic corporate \nincome tax (CIT) rate is 10% for income up to $1.14 million and the portion of income \nexceeding that amount is subject to 25% CIT. CIT exemptions apply to business incomes \nderiving from innovative and environment-friendly technology, and to entities where the \nmajority of employees are disabled. Investors and domestic businesses often point out \nbureaucratic hurdles and a lack of clarity in the application of tax laws and regulations, \nparticularly with regard to deductible costs and VAT rebates. The government revenues \nthrough taxation and state-owned entities remain high. Finally, real interest rates are very \nhigh compared to other emerging markets. With this macroeconomic environment, many \ncompanies face the following difficulties: high labor costs, high borrowing costs, and low \nproductivity. \n5.1  Regulatory Framework  \nAccording to the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business report (World Bank 2019), Mongolia has \nbeen ranked 74th out of 190 economies. The most hindering issues are resolving \ninsolvency (rank 152nd), getting electricity (148th), and trading across borders (117th). \nThe ranking of Mongolia in Doing Business topics is shown in Figure 9.  \n \n12 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1019  L. Boojoo \n \nFigure 9: Ranking of Mongolia in Doing Business Topics  \n \nSource: World Bank (2019). \nIn the Doing Business report, investors report that the business registration process in \nMongolia is reasonable, efficient, and clear. There is no differentiation between foreign \nand domestic enterprises. The big issue is the nontransparent, legal, regulatory, and \naccounting practice.  \nTo be identified as an SME and get funding from the SME Development Fund and other \nfunds,  enterprises  have  to  apply  for  a  certificate  at  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  \nand Light Industry after registration. The following documents are required for the \napplication: \n1.  An official letter, which states the sector and direction of activities, specification, \nofficial address, telephone number, and email address.  \n2.  A copy of the State Registration Certificate. \n3.  Attestation from the Social Insurance Department of the district with the total \nnumber of insured employees.  \n4.  Attestation from the Tax Department of the district. \n5.  Confirmed financial statements for the previous year.  \nThe Law on Land was adopted in 1994 and revised in 2002. Within this law, it is possible \nto own, use, and possess land. A holder of immovable property usually holds two \nseparate certificates: one for the land and one for the building on the land. Having a \ncertificate for land doesn\u2019t mean that you are the owner of this land, you only hold \npossession rights.2 \nThe Bankruptcy Law of Mongolia was first adopted in 1997 and since then there have \nbeen no amendments. It defines bankruptcy as a civil matter. The bankruptcy process is \ntoo vague, onerous, and time-consuming. According to the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business \nreport, it takes four years to become bankrupt.  \n \n \n2  \u201cOwning land means legitimate control and disposing of land.  \nPossession of a land is the right to use the land oneself or sublease to others. Mongolian citizens and \nentities have the right to possess land for up to 60 years, to sublease, to transfer with the approval of the \nland authority, or to pledge it as collateral. Foreign citizens and entities cannot obtain possession rights \nover land in Mongolia\u201d (IFC 2014).  \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1019  L. Boojoo \n \nFamily ties still play a significant role, therefore many businesses are established as \nfamily businesses or with the support of family members. Business decisions are usually \nmade jointly within the family.  \nSince the democratic changes in 1990, women have had a high social status in terms of, \nfor example, equality in education and social rights. Since these democratic changes, \nmany women have started their own business and now perform the same jobs as men. \nThe legal framework provides equal rights in inheritance, land use, and ownership of \nproperty. The primary caretakers of households and children are women. This is the \nreason why women\u2019s businesses are typically smaller, demonstrate lower turnover rates, \nand have fewer employees (UNDP 2018). \n6.  STATUS OF DOMESTIC AND GLOBAL VALUE \nCHAINS IN MONGOLIA \nDeveloping value chains is crucial to enable landlocked countries to overcome the \ndependency on the mining sector. Overall, value chains can be defined as follows:  \n\u201cThe value chain describes the full range of activities that firms and workers do \nto bring a product from its conception to its end use and beyond. This includes \nactivities such as design, production, marketing, distribution, and support to the \nfinal consumer. The activities that comprise a value chain can be contained within \na single firm or divided among different firms. Value chain activities can produce \ngoods or services and can be contained within a single geographical location or \nspread over wider areas.\u201d (Duke University 2019) \n\u201cA set of activities that are performed to design, produce and market, deliver, and \nsupport its product\u201d (Porter 1985) \n\u201cInternational production, trade, and investments are increasingly organized with \nso-called  \u2018global  value  chains\u2019  (GVCs)  where  the  different  stages  of  \nthe production process are located across different countries\u2026.. Global value \nchains  have  become  a  dominant  feature  of  world  trade,  encompassing \ndeveloping,  emerging,  and  developed  economies.  The  whole  process  of \nproducing goods, from raw materials to finished products, is increasingly carried \nout wherever the necessary skills and materials are available at competitive cost \nand quality. Similarly, trade in services is essential for the efficient functioning of \nGVCs, not only because services link activities across countries but also because \nthey help companies to increase the value of their products.\u201d (OECD 2019) \nIn order to identify value chains in a country, numerous factors have to be researched, \nincluding supply chain and operational factors such as purchase order management, \nproduction, distribution, sales orders, management, and so on. Within this paper, three \nfactors of potential value chains are identified: \n\u2022  Products that have the potential to be exported; \n\u2022  The majority of raw materials used for the production come from a local source. \nIn other words, the existence of a production supply chain in the country; \n\u2022  Many people work in this VC.  \n14 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1019  L.

It provides income and employment for over a third of \nthe  population.  In  the  past,  the  cashmere  industry  has  received  extensive  funds, \nincentives,  and  technical  assistance  from  the  government  and  international  donor \norganizations.  \nAccording to the Cashmere and Wool Association, the availability of raw materials is as \nfollows: cashmere \u2012 8,500 tons; camel wool \u2012 1,400 tons; sheep wool \u2012 25,000 tons; yak \nmolts  \u2012  500  tons.

Twelve companies exported \ngoods worth $4.58 million to the UK, 11 companies exported goods worth $4.87 million \nto  France,  11  companies  exported  goods  worth  $5.56  million  to  Japan,  and  26 \ncompanies  exported  goods  worth  $7.23  million  to  the  Republic  of  Korea  in  2017 \n(Mongolian Wool and Cashmere Association 2018). \nThe biggest company in this sector is Gobi Cashmere. Gobi Cashmere was established \nin 1981 with investment from Japan and was privatized in July 2007. Since then it has \nbeen  restructured  and  become  a  joint  stock  company.  In  December  2017,  \nit  bought  Goyo  Cashmere  LLC,  which  was  one  of  the  first  factories  established  \nwith private investment in 1993 and one of the biggest.

Gobi Cashmere and Goyo \nCashmere are also factories that have a full production range, from washing to wool \ncarding, spinning and knitting, braiding yarn, and final products. They sell their products \nin 19 countries.  \nThe second biggest cashmere producer, Cashmere Holding, was established in 1994 \nwith the joint investment of a Mongolian company, Altai Holding, and a British company, \nD.B. Holdsworth. D.B. Holdsworth had owned 30% of the shares until 2006 when Altai \nHolding LLC bought back the shares and became the full owner.  \nCompanies that operate in the Mongolian cashmere sector face various challenges:  \n\u2022  The biggest challenge is that the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) causes price \ndumping of raw cashmere in the world market. Chinese companies also cause \nraw cashmere price hikes within the country when trying to buy Mongolian \ncashmere.  As  a  result,  the  price  of  raw  cashmere  increases  every  year, \nburdening  the  local  companies.  As  a  countermeasure,  the  Mongolian \ngovernment gives subsidies in order to get the herders to sell their raw cashmere \nto  domestic  companies.  For  example,  government  subsidies  amounted  to \nMNT22.6 billion in 2016 and MNT22.5 billion in 2017.  \n\u2022  The availability of raw cashmere is highly seasonal and possible only in spring, \ntherefore  companies  need  a  huge  amount  of  current  assets.  Furthermore, \nsufficient storage is required to accumulate enough raw cashmere.  \n\u2022  Big companies are interested in having a full production range, including washing \nand wool carding.  \n\u2022  One  corporation  has  a  monopoly  position  in  the  cashmere  sector,  due  to \ninsufficient regulations on fair competition. As a result, Mongolian SMEs will find \nit difficult to develop further.  \n16 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1019  L. Boojoo \n \n\u2022  The fact that herders pay no taxes affects the quality of raw cashmere.

Furthermore, human resources are one of the biggest \nchallenges, since big companies or unions need an agronomist and there\u2019s a need  \nto prepare experts and specialized people in this sector. There are approximately  \n40 factories operating in the sector nationwide, and for these factories, advancement in \ntechnologies and access to financing are crucial. For instance, ca. 30%\u201240% of the total \nharvests are lost during the process of harvesting due to the lack of technologies, since \nthe berries are tightly bunched along the branches, and the harvesting of sea buckthorn \nis  very  difficult  and  requires  certain  equipment.  Therefore,  technologies  such  as \nharvesting equipment are important, since harvesting requires manual labor. In the \nfuture, the production of sea buckthorn should be automated. \nThere is a need to cooperate with national and international research organizations in \norder to improve this sector.  \nLong-term financing is required, because sea buckthorn starts bearing fruit three to  \nfive  years  after  planting.

Foreign tourists usually book and pay for their tours at least \nsix months before, therefore the fluctuation of the tugrik against the US dollar can be a \nbig risk. \nThe tourism sector is seasonal due to the very cold and harsh winters in Mongolia. The \ntourist season is from June to September each year. Special programs such as winter or \nadventure tourism need to be developed to prolong the season.  \n\u2022  It is impossible to develop the tourism in Mongolia as mass tourism, because only \na few people with specific interests come to Mongolia and traveling costs are \nhigh. The tourism sector faces many other challenges as well.  \n\u2022  Due to the underdeveloped infrastructure, there are only domestic flights to a few \nprovinces. Furthermore, the flights are relatively expensive.  \n\u2022  Another weakness is that the healthcare infrastructure is poor. In the case  \nof  an  accident  or  illness  in  the  countryside,  the  injured  person  needs  to  \nbe  transported  to  a  city,  where  advanced  healthcare  is  provided  and  this  \ntakes time.  \n\u2022  In recent years, travelers riding in their vehicles have come to Mongolia through \nthe Russian Federation. But, due to the poor road infrastructure, there are not \nenough traffic signs. Thus travelers are usually unaware of the distance to the \nnext filling station or directions.  \n7.  VALUE CHAIN FINANCING ANALYSIS \nThe limited access to the finance the SMEs of Mongolia need hinders them in terms of \ncreating jobs, economic growth, and further developing their business. There are no \nvalue  chain  financing  mechanisms  available.  The  bank-dominated  financial  sector  \nof Mongolia offers loans, and deposit and saving products. There is a need to develop \nventure capital, factoring, leasing, overdraft facilities, start-up finance, and other finance \nmechanisms.  \nThere are no financial incentives for exporters. \n8.  POLICIES TO PROMOTE SME FINANCE \nThere  are  different  laws  and  programs  available  to  support  the  development  of  \nSMEs. A credit risk database is available at the Bank of Mongolia, but only banks have \naccess to this database. Some of the important and relevant laws and programs are \nlisted below. \nThe Government of Mongolia has established different funds to provide financial support \nfor SMEs. The following funds are available for SMEs (Table 10).  \nThe SME Development Fund was established to support financing for SMEs by providing \nlong-term concessional loans for SME operations, allowing SMEs to access production \nequipment through financial leasing, offering double guarantees for SMEs and promoting \nactivities of subsidized SMEs, organizing workshops and training and operating from the \nMinistry of Food, Agriculture and Light Industry. In the period from 2009 to 2017 the SME \nDevelopment Fund received 26,454 applications. Only 18% or 7,536 were approved and \nthey received a total funding of MNT835.2 billion in concessional loans, or 4.3%\u20126.5% \nof total SME finance. But the government structure supporting SMEs including the \n21 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1019  L. Boojoo \n \nSMEDF was not sustainable in the past. For instance, the SME fund has operated under \ndifferent ministries: From 2012 to 2014 it operated under the Ministry of Economic \nDevelopment, from 2014 to 2016 under the Ministry of Industry, and from 2016 under the \nMinistry of Agriculture and Light Industry. The Ministry of Economic Development was \ndissolved  in  2014  and  the  Ministry  of  Industry  in  2016.

Currently, MNT37.3 billion  \nfor 111 guaranteed credits have been granted: 84 of these guarantees were issued  \nin Ulaanbaatar, and 27 in local areas. Financed by foreign credits and grants, no \nsubsidiaries from the budget.  \nThe CGF is located only in Ulaanbaatar. They cooperate with five commercial banks. If \nthe collateral of an SME is not enough to get the credit they can apply for a credit \nguarantee. The usual process is that they have to apply for it at their local bank and the \nbank  submits  the  application  to  the  CGF.  The  CGF  studies  the  application  and \ndocuments submitted. When the CGF approves the application, the bank examines the \nsubmitted documents carefully. The final decision is made by the credit committee of the \nbank.  \n9.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \nThe main source of funding for SMEs is commercial banks. Loan guarantees are used \nby the government to ease SMEs\u2019 access to finance. Some funds have been established \nto support the development of SMEs.  \nAccess to finance and a lack of collateral are important issues for SMEs. The cost of \nfinancing is very high and there are insufficient support and subsidies from government \nagencies. The banking system offers very basic and traditional financing mechanisms, a \nlack of value chain financing, and other risk mechanisms for the exchange rate. \nStudies on the financial literacy of SMEs have not been conducted yet. Therefore it is \ndifficult to assess the financial education of SMEs. \nThus, the following recommendations can be formulated.  \n1.  A proper definition of SMEs is needed with changes to the law. If not, the funding \nfrom  the  SME  Development  Fund  and  others  will  be  misused  in  the  \nlong term.  \n2.  A unified database for SMEs is needed in order to obtain accurate statistics and \ndevelop effective policy measures, and a credit risk database is necessary to \novercome the problem of information asymmetry faced by SMEs. \n3.  Studies on the financial literacy of SMEs are needed to identify their real needs \nand a national financial literacy strategy should be developed. Such studies \nshould be carried out on a regular base to identify their development and to \ndevelop focused products for them.  \n24 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1019  L. Boojoo \n \n4.

Value chains that have their potential developed further are the cashmere, tourism, fruit, and berry sectors. We also discuss key factors in the development of SMEs in Mongolia along with factors hindering their development. There is no unified database on SMEs and different organizations are responsible for gathering data on them. Thus the statistics on SMEs are inconsistent and fragmented. Therefore, it is difficult to present a clear picture of SMEs and make sound policies based on reliable, coherent analysis and data in favor of SMEs. Due to the sparse population, traditional banking services are costly, especially outside residential areas. A lack of sound credit infrastructure and governmental regulations are the main problems in the credit market for SMEs. Financial institutions offer only a few available financial products, due to the underdeveloped Mongolian financial sectors, insufficient government support, and the lack of a regulatory framework. We conclude by emphasizing the need to (i) improve the quality of data on SMEs and establish the relevance of in-depth study of financial literacy to obtain a clear picture of them and develop effective policies; (ii) improve the regulatory framework for business, especially the fair competitiveness regulations; (iii) develop the regulatory framework for other sources of funding; and (iv) develop a long-term national program for SMEs.", "Title": "Leveraging SME Finance through Value Chains in the CAREC Landlocked Economies: Case of Mongolia"}}
