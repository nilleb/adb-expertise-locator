INTRODUCTION \n\nL. Boojoo \n\nMongolia  transitioned  to  a  market  economy  in  1990  and  became  one  of  the  fastest-\ngrowing economies due to the double-digit growth for three consecutive years in early \n2010. With the slowdown of commodity prices the economic growth started to decline. \nThe latest reports from the NSO and the World Bank show that the poverty rate is 35.5% \nin the countryside, compared to 23.2% in urban areas. \n\nAdministratively, Mongolia is divided into 21 aimags and the capital city of Ulaanbaatar, \nwhich is not part of a province. While up to 65% of GDP is produced in Ulaanbaatar city \nand  10%  is  produced  in  Orkhon  province  where  the  Erdenet  Mining  Corporation  has \nbeen active since 1978, the remaining 25% is divided amongst the other 20 provinces. \nGDP  per \nin  \nthe  city.  There  is  a  lower  level  of  job  opportunity  and  the  business  environment  \nis  unfavorable,  due  to  poor  infrastructure  and  low  market  potential,  amongst  other \nproblems. \n\ncountryside \n\ncapita \n\ntimes \n\nlower \n\nthree \n\nthan \n\nthe \n\nin \n\nis \n\nThe  research  question  of  this  paper  is:  \u201cAre  business  environment  and  financing \nmechanisms favorable for SMEs?\u201d \n\n1.1  Analytical Framework \n\nSMEs are the main drivers of an economy because they create most of the jobs and \ncontribute to reducing poverty and inclusive economic growth. Thus, support of SMEs \nthrough  effective  policies  and  financing  mechanisms  remains  the  primary  goal  of \ncountries  across  the  world.  Today,  SMEs  in  developing  countries  are  facing  many \ndifficulties.  The  objective  of  this  paper  is  to  identify  the  bottlenecks  and  drivers  of \neconomic growth as well as value chains with high growth potential.  \n\nIn general, the share of SMEs in GDP, business environment, financing mechanisms, \ngovernment  policies,  and  inclusion  of  SMEs  in  the  value  chain  of  a  country  are  the \nimportant factors that have to be studied.  \n\n2.  ECONOMIC SITUATION \n\nMongolia is landlocked and one of the world\u2019s most sparsely populated countries. The \neconomic growth of Mongolia was very volatile in the last decade. Due to large projects \nin mining and infrastructure, the economic growth of Mongolia in the period from 2010 to \n2014 was high. A sharp slowdown of growth occurred when the commodity prices fell in \n2016,  which  highlighted  again  the  need  for  economic  diversification  and  high \ndependency on mining. In recent years, migration in Mongolia has continued the trend \nof rural to urban flows, particularly in Ulaanbaatar. The present urban population is above \n1.3  million  or  almost  half  of  the  population  of  Mongolia.  Despite  significant  economic \nopportunities, poverty and inequality continue to be serious problems and inequalities \nare widening between regions and between rural and urban areas.  \n\nThe main driver of economic growth is mining and quarrying (24.5% of GDP as of 2017), \nwhile  the  second  largest  sector  is  wholesale  and  retail  (15.7%  of  GDP  as  of  2017), \nfollowed  by  agriculture  (10.2%  of  GDP  as  of  2017)  and  manufacturing  (10.5%  \nof  GDP  as  of  2017).  The  real  estate  sector  makes  up  6.0%  of  GDP,  financial  and \ninsurance activities 5.1%, transportation and storage 4.8%, and construction 4.1% as of \n2017 (Figure 1). \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1019 \n \n\nL. Boojoo \n\nFigure 1: GDP Breakdown by Sectors \n\nSource: NSO (2019a). \n\n \n\nAccording to the statistical information from the General Taxation Department, there are \n78,585  legal  entities  active  in  Mongolia.  Almost  70%  of  enterprises  are  located  in \nUlaanbaatar, and about 86% or 67,612 of those are SMEs.  \n\nThe  SME  Law  was  first  introduced  in  2007  in  which  SMEs  are  defined  as  legally \nregistered business entities with 199 or fewer employees with an annual turnover of up \nto MNT1.5 billion (approx. $833,000), and the sectors in which they are active are also \ndefined (Table 1). \n\nTable 1: Definition of SMEs in Mongolia \n\nEnterprise \nCategory \nSmall \n \nMedium-sized \n \n\nSector \n\nAll sectors \nServices \nWholesale \nRetail/Manufacturing \n\nNumber of \nEmployees \n\u2264 19 employees \n\u2264 49 employees \n\u2264 149 employees \n\u2264 199 employees \n\nAnnual Turnover  \nin MNT \n\u2264 MNT250 million \n\u2264 MNT1.0 billion \n\u2264 MNT1.5 billion \n\u2264 MNT1.5 billion \n\nSource: SME Law of Mongolia (2007). \n\nThe National Statistical Office (NSO) uses different employee number categorization for \nthe business register database and commercial banks use different definitions for their \nclient segmentation.  \n\nThe  business  register  of  the  NSO  divides  enterprises  according  to  the  number  of \nemployees they have (Table 2). The NSO\u2019s classification of enterprises is as follows:  \n\n \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1019 \n \n\nL.

Therefore, \nTable 3 are not the exact numbers, but only a small subset of them.

Ca. 77% of \nthese active establishments are SMEs and they account for 17.8% of the total GDP and \n2.3% of the exports. Some 70% of the economically active population are employed in \nSMEs, while the Ministry of Agriculture and Light Industry reports that there are about \n760,000  people  employed  in  SMEs,  which  makes  up  69%  of  the  total  employment. \nAvailable statistics on SMEs are inconsistent and fragmented, due to the lack of a unified \ndatabase on SMEs. \n\n2.1   Mongolia\u2019s Financial Situation \n\nAfter high economic growth years in 2012\u20122013, the economy faced serious problems \nin 2015 when the GDP growth declined to 2.5% and was only 1.6% in 2016. Along with \nthe  economic  boom  starting  in  2012,  government  debt  also  started  to  rise.  In  2015, \nMongolia\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio was 62% and at the end of 2016 it had reached 93%. \n\nAfter the elections of 2016, the new government started negotiating with the IMF, and in \n2017, they reached an agreement. Under the Extended Fund Facility program, the IMF \nand  other  development  partners  started  providing  financial  support  with  $5.5  billion \npackages. The EFF of the IMF is a three-year program and will end in 2019. \n\nIn order to stabilize the economy in the short term and restructure it in the medium term, \nthe government of Mongolia has undertaken various policies and reform measures under \nthe terms of the agreement. These measures, which have to be taken, are strengthening \nthe fiscal policy to reduce the vulnerability of the boom and bust cycles of the economy \nand strengthening the financial sector and monetary policy (UNDP 2018). \n\nThe macroeconomic environment in Mongolia is not conducive to the development of the \nmanufacturing industry. The real exchange rate has been rising over the last 10 years, \ndepreciating the Mongolian tugrik against major currencies. These relative exchange rate \nmovements have widened Mongolia\u2019s cost disadvantage.  \n\nIn  the  fourth  quarter  of  2018,  external  debt  in  Mongolia  increased  to  $28.7  billion, \nreaching  an  all-time  highest  debt  amount.  The  large  amount  of  money  that  has  to  be \nrepaid  will  negatively  affect  the  economy,  depleting  the  resources  covering  critical \ngovernment services, including health, social welfare, and education along with financing \nof SMEs. \n\n2.2  Financial Infrastructure \n\nMongolia  is  one  of  the  most  sparsely  populated  countries  in  the  world,  which  makes \ntraditional  banking  outside  of  settlements  difficult  and  costly.  The  financial  sector  \nof  Mongolia  is  dominated  by  banks,  which  make  up  about  96%.  There  are  currently  \n14 commercial banks in Mongolia. The commercial banks of Mongolia have the biggest \ninfrastructure  in  the  country,  with  Khan  Bank  and  the  State  Bank  having  the  biggest \nnetworks. Financial and insurance activities (MNT1.67 trillion) contributed 5.2% of GDP \n(MNT32.2 trillion) in 2018 at current prices. \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1019 \n \n\n \n\nL.

They \nprovide a variety of financial services but most of them are located in Ulaanbaatar and \nonly a few of them are active in rural areas.  \n\nAccording  to  the  FRC,  there  are  about  400  saving  and  credit  cooperatives  (SCCs) \nregistered in Mongolia, but only 289 are active. In Ulaanbaatar, there are 186, and in \nrural areas, there are 103 active. The SCCs have about 61,000 members and less than \na 0.5% share in Mongolia\u2019s financial sector.  \n\nThe total number of outstanding loans issued by banks to SMEs in the last three years \nwas  between  MNT2.01  trillion  and  MNT3  trillion,  about  17%\u201319%  of  total  loans.  That \nmeans that the number of SME loans hasn\u2019t increased dramatically over the last three \nyears. The average interest rate in the last three years was between 17.9% and 19.9%.  \n\nFigure 2 shows the loans of individuals issued in different sectors, taken for business \npurposes.

Within this initiative, Mongolia has signed up \nto the Partnership for Action on Green Economy (PAGE). With the implementation of the \nPAGE  project  in  Mongolia,  different  green  initiatives  were  started.  The  Green \nDevelopment  Policy  was  adopted  by  the  Parliament  on  13  June  2014,  which  defines \ngreen  development  goals,  objectives,  and  their  implementation  policy  divided  into \nmedium and long term. Mongolian government agencies, industry players, and financial \ninstitutions  met  in  May  2013  at  the  first  Mongolian  Sustainable  Finance  Forum  in \nUlaanbaatar  to  discuss  how  they  can  work  together  towards  a  green  civilization  for \nMongolia (Mongolia Bank Association 2019). This forum has become an annual event \nwhere  all  major  stakeholders  of  the  Mongolian  banking  industry,  including  all  14 \nMongolian  banks,  the  Mongolian  Bankers  Association,  the  Banking  and  Finance \nAcademy,  and  government  agencies  like  the  Bank  of  Mongolia  and  the  Ministry  of \nEnvironment and Tourism, come together to discuss offering sustainable finance. At the \nfirst  forum,  the  Mongolian  banks  declared  they  would  jointly  develop  the  Mongolian \nSustainable Finance Principles.  \n\nOnly  XacBank  of  Mongolia  received  an  accreditation  from  the  Green  Climate  Fund,  \non  14  October  2016  (XacBank  2016).  On  11  May  2017,  they  received  a  $20  million \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1019 \n \n\nL. Boojoo \n\nfinancing package. In the first phase, $500,000 was granted to support micro, small, and \nmedium-sized enterprises finance low-carbon initiatives.1 \n\n \n\nThe  EBRD  and  Green  Climate  Fund  cofinanced  a  program  to  deliver  climate  finance \nthrough Partner Financial Institutions in developing countries. The focus of the program \nwill be in the areas of energy efficiency, renewable energy, and climate resilience (Green \nClimate Fund 2017). \n\nKhan  Bank  and  XacBank  are  the  two  banks  specialized  in  micro  and  rural  lending. \nAnother financial intermediary that are offering microfinance and are not supervised are \npawnshops. Their regulation is covered in different laws, but a special regulation for them \ndoes not exist. Therefore, exact numbers or statistics are not available. It is estimated \nthat about 1,500 pawnshops are active and about 350 of them are in Ulaanbaatar. The \nitems that are used as collateral are mostly movable property and are not registered in \na  unified  database.  The  interest  rates  are  between  3.5%  and  15%  per  week.  Many \nproblems \nare  \nnot sufficiently regulated. For instance, when pawnshops sell personal property, which \nhas been used as collateral, at a higher price, they don\u2019t return the change to the lenders. \nTherefore, the responsibility of pawnshops should be increased, and in order to do so, \nmore regulations and a unified database, which registers movable property, are required.  \n\noperations \n\npawnshop \n\nregarding \n\nlending \n\noccur \n\nsince \n\nIn recent years, microlending possibilities via mobile phone have been developed and \nbecome  more  accessible.  Now  it  has  become  possible  to  lend  up  to  MNT2  million \nimmediately  using  a  mobile  phone.  For  instance,  the  application  LEND  can  be \ndownloaded on a smartphone and offers such loans.  \n\nDiversified  financing  mechanisms  are  not  available  for  SMEs.  Other  financing \npossibilities  like  venture  capital,  mezzanine  capital,  angels,  crowdfunding,  and \ncrowdlending do not exist.  \n\n3.  STATUS OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION FOR SMES \n\nIndividuals and businesses are able to open an account at a bank and obtain affordable \nfinancial products and services. The banks offer a full range of banking products, such \nas transactions, payments, saving, credit, and insurance. According to the latest 2017 \nGlobal Findex survey of the World Bank, about 93% of the adults in Mongolia have an \naccount.  Since  most  payment  services,  including  salaries,  pensions,  social  welfare, \npayments, \nBank,  \nalmost  every  Mongolian  citizen  has  a  Khan  Bank  account.  The  Mongolian  Bankers \nAssociation has stated that Khan Bank has provided its banking services to 2.4 million \ncustomers  and  had  1.7  million  card  owners  and  53,000  corporate  customers  in  2017 \n(Khan Bank 2019). \n\nremittances, \n\ndistributed \n\nthrough \n\nKhan \n\nand \n\nare \n\nIn  recent  years,  the  number  of  mobile  phone  users  has  grown  fast,  which  has  made \nInternet banking, especially mobile banking users, grow steadily. Figure 4 shows that the \nnumber of Internet banking users almost tripled and the number of mobile banking users \ndoubled from 2015 to 2017. \n\nBanks  are  the  main  source  of  funding,  but  there  are  also  support  schemes  from  the \ngovernment  and  IFIs  available.  The  Bank  of  Mongolia  publishes  an  annual  survey,  \nthe \u201cDevelopment of SMEs and their financial situation\u201d report, conducted among micro-\n\n1   Green Climate Fund (2017). \n\n \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1019 \n \n\nL. Boojoo \n\nenterprises  and  SMEs.  The  objective  of  the  study  is  to  identify  the  development, \noperations, and financing situation, and financing issues and challenges faced by SMEs \nfor  policymakers.  According  to  the  Bank  of  Mongolia,  there  are  75,796  SMEs  \nin Mongolia, with 48,519 in Ulaanbaatar and 27,277 in other provinces. According to the \nBank  of  Mongolia,  56%  of  SMEs  have  used  an  external  financing instrument  for  their \nbusiness  expansion.  Among  those  enterprises,  81%  have  obtained  loans  from \ncommercial  banks,  while  NBFI  loans  and  subsidized  loans  were  among  the  less \nfrequently  used  financial  sources  at  7%  and  6%,  respectively  (Figure  5).  Also,  4%  of \nSMEs use informal financial sources such as borrowing from family and friends.  \n\nFigure 4: Active Internet and Mobile Banking Users \n\nSource: Bank of Mongolia (2019). \n\nFigure 5: SME Financing Sources  \n(%) \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Bank of Mongolia (2017). \n\nThe  latest  report  of  2017  shows  that  SMEs  get  53.7%  of  their  financial  support  from \nbanks, 32.8% from another source of funding, 15.3% from local government or provincial \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1019 \n \n\nL.

According  to  the  World  Bank  Global  Financial \nDevelopment Database, 42% of SMEs had a line of credit in 2013.  \n\nFigure 6 shows in which sectors and by which organizations SMEs were supported. The \ncommercial banks have provided the most financial support in all sectors.  \n\nFigure 6: SME Support from Different Stakeholders (by Sector) \n(%) \n\nSource: Bank of Mongolia (2017). \n\n \n\nAccording to the Bank of Mongolia survey (Figure 7), the majority of SMEs need about \nMNT10 million\u2012MNT49.9 million (about $3,800\u2012$18,900). Figure 8 shows that by far the \nbiggest use of credit is for working capital. \n\nFigure 7: Financial Support Needed \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1019 \n \n\nSource: Bank of Mongolia (2017). \n\n \n\n \n\nL.

FINANCIAL KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS  \n\nOF SME ENTREPRENEURS \n\n4.1  Assessments of Financial Literacy  \n\nThere are different research reports available on SMEs, but not specifically on financial \nliteracy. Most of the banks, the Mongolian National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, \nand the NGO offer training on financial literacy but no assessment of financial literacy \nhas  been  carried  out.  There  are  also  no  figures  available  regarding  how  many  SMEs \nhave taken up such training.  \n\n4.2  Financial Literacy Programs \n\nThe  Bank  of  Mongolia,  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Culture  \nand Sport, the Financial Regulatory Commission, the Mongolian Banks Association, the \nMongolian \nInsurance  Corporation,  nonstate \nthe  Savings \norganizations operating in the financial sector, and relevant associations and universities \nhave  developed  a  program  with  the  technical  support  of  the  World  Bank\u2019s  National \nmidterm program 2016\u20122021 for financial literacy. The program focuses on four areas:  \n\nInsurers  Association, \n\n\u2022  a financial literacy program for school children  \n\nfinancial education for young people  \n\nfinancial education for rural residents  \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nfinancial  education  through  mass  communication/media  (Bank  of  Mongolia \n2016). \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1019 \n \n\nL. Boojoo \n\nThe objectives of the program are: to improve people\u2019s financial discipline; to improve \ntheir  ability  to  make  sound  financial  decisions;  to  increase  long-term  savings  and \nfinancial investments; to increase people\u2019s trust in the banking system; and to promote \nthe  long-term  and  sustainable  economic  development  of  the  country.  No  assessment \nhas been carried out. SMEs are not part of this program.  \n\n5.  BARRIERS TO SME FINANCE \n\nThe  biggest  challenge  SMEs  are  facing  is  that  financial  institutions  that  offer  finance  \nto  SMEs  cannot  offer  long-term  financing  and  the  interest  rates  are  very  high.  The \nmaximum maturity is 48 months and the average interest rate is 1.5%\u20132.5% per month. \nAs usual, if an entrepreneur is applying for a loan for the first time, the maximum maturity \ntime is 24 months and the interest rate is the highest. If they have repaid the first loan in \ntime and they apply for a second time they get more favorable conditions.  \n\nMost SMEs lack collateral. According OECD (2016), collateral requirements are overly \ndemanding, with the average amount reaching close to 200% of the value of loans in \n99.7% of cases, which reflects the deep distrust shown by financial institutions.  \n\nSMEs can\u2019t apply for SME funding from the SME Development Fund when they need it. \nThey have to wait until the SME fund is announced. A committee decides which SMEs \nwill get the funding after they receive the projects. The funding of the projects selected \nwill be transferred directly to their bank accounts. The funds have not been used properly \nsince  the  project  selection  process  has  not  been  transparent.  Also,  the  tender \nannouncement dates have also been unclear. The standing committee of the Parliament \nis changing the procurement process after some  members of parliament misused the \nfunding and approved funding for their own companies.  \n\nAccess to finance is not sufficient for SMEs. In terms of access to finance, the financial \nproducts  available  are  also  insufficient.  The  main  source  of  funding  for  SMEs  are \ncommercial banks, however there is no competition among the banks. The amount of \nloan, collateral, maturity time, and interest rate offered to SMEs by the banks are similar \nand show no significant difference.  \n\nThe  mandatory  social  payments  in  Mongolia  are  relatively  high.  The  basic  corporate \nincome tax (CIT) rate is 10% for income up to $1.14 million and the portion of income \nexceeding that amount is subject to 25% CIT. CIT exemptions apply to business incomes \nderiving from innovative and environment-friendly technology, and to entities where the \nmajority of employees are disabled. Investors and domestic businesses often point out \nbureaucratic hurdles and a lack of clarity in the application of tax laws and regulations, \nparticularly with regard to deductible costs and VAT rebates. The government revenues \nthrough taxation and state-owned entities remain high. Finally, real interest rates are very \nhigh compared to other emerging markets. With this macroeconomic environment, many \ncompanies face the following difficulties: high labor costs, high borrowing costs, and low \nproductivity. \n\n5.1  Regulatory Framework  \n\nAccording to the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business report (World Bank 2019), Mongolia has \nbeen  ranked  74th  out  of  190  economies.  The  most  hindering  issues  are  resolving \ninsolvency (rank 152nd), getting electricity (148th), and trading across borders (117th). \nThe ranking of Mongolia in Doing Business topics is shown in Figure 9.  \n\n \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1019 \n \n\nL. Boojoo \n\nFigure 9: Ranking of Mongolia in Doing Business Topics  \n\nSource: World Bank (2019). \n\n \n\nIn the Doing Business report, investors report that the business registration process in \nMongolia is reasonable, efficient, and clear. There is no differentiation between foreign \nand  domestic  enterprises.  The  big  issue  is  the  nontransparent,  legal,  regulatory,  and \naccounting practice.  \n\nTo be identified as an SME and get funding from the SME Development Fund and other \nfunds,  enterprises  have  to  apply  for  a  certificate  at  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  \nand  Light  Industry  after  registration.  The  following  documents  are  required  for  the \napplication: \n\n1.  An official letter, which states the sector and direction of activities, specification, \n\nofficial address, telephone number, and email address.  \n\n2.  A copy of the State Registration Certificate. \n\n3.  Attestation  from  the  Social  Insurance  Department  of  the  district  with  the  total \n\nnumber of insured employees.  \n\n4.  Attestation from the Tax Department of the district. \n\n5.  Confirmed financial statements for the previous year.  \n\nThe Law on Land was adopted in 1994 and revised in 2002. Within this law, it is possible \nto  own,  use,  and  possess  land.  A  holder  of  immovable  property  usually  holds  two \nseparate  certificates:  one  for  the  land  and  one  for  the  building  on  the  land.  Having  a \ncertificate  for  land  doesn\u2019t  mean  that  you  are  the  owner  of  this  land,  you  only  hold \npossession rights.2 \n\nThe Bankruptcy Law of Mongolia was first adopted in 1997 and since then there have \nbeen no amendments. It defines bankruptcy as a civil matter. The bankruptcy process is \ntoo vague, onerous, and time-consuming. According to the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business \nreport, it takes four years to become bankrupt.  \n\n \n\n2   \u201cOwning land means legitimate control and disposing of land.  \n\n \n\nPossession of a land is the right to use the land oneself or sublease to others. Mongolian citizens and \nentities have the right to possess land for up to 60 years, to sublease, to transfer with the approval of the \nland authority, or to pledge it as collateral. Foreign citizens and entities cannot obtain possession rights \nover land in Mongolia\u201d (IFC 2014).  \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1019 \n \n\nL. Boojoo \n\nFamily  ties  still  play  a  significant  role,  therefore  many  businesses  are  established  as \nfamily businesses or with the support of family members. Business decisions are usually \nmade jointly within the family.  \n\nSince the democratic changes in 1990, women have had a high social status in terms of, \nfor example, equality in education and social rights. Since these democratic changes, \nmany women have started their own business and now perform the same jobs as men. \nThe  legal  framework  provides  equal  rights  in  inheritance,  land  use,  and  ownership  of \nproperty.  The  primary  caretakers  of  households  and  children  are  women.  This  is  the \nreason why women\u2019s businesses are typically smaller, demonstrate lower turnover rates, \nand have fewer employees (UNDP 2018). \n\n6.  STATUS OF DOMESTIC AND GLOBAL VALUE \n\nCHAINS IN MONGOLIA \n\nDeveloping  value  chains  is  crucial  to  enable  landlocked  countries  to  overcome  the \ndependency on the mining sector. Overall, value chains can be defined as follows:  \n\n\u201cThe value chain describes the full range of activities that firms and workers do \nto bring a product from its conception to its end use and beyond. This includes \nactivities such as design, production, marketing, distribution, and support to the \nfinal consumer. The activities that comprise a value chain can be contained within \na single firm or divided among different firms. Value chain activities can produce \ngoods or services and can be contained within a single geographical location or \nspread over wider areas.\u201d (Duke University 2019) \n\n\u201cA set of activities that are performed to design, produce and market, deliver, and \nsupport its product\u201d (Porter 1985) \n\n\u2018global  value  chains\u2019  (GVCs)  where \n\n\u201cInternational production, trade, and investments are increasingly organized with \nso-called \nthe  different  stages  of  \nthe  production  process  are  located  across  different  countries\u2026..  Global  value \nchains  have  become  a  dominant  feature  of  world  trade,  encompassing \ndeveloping,  emerging,  and  developed  economies.  The  whole  process  of \nproducing goods, from raw materials to finished products, is increasingly carried \nout wherever the necessary skills and materials are available at competitive cost \nand quality. Similarly, trade in services is essential for the efficient functioning of \nGVCs, not only because services link activities across countries but also because \nthey help companies to increase the value of their products.\u201d (OECD 2019) \n\nIn order to identify value chains in a country, numerous factors have to be researched, \nincluding  supply  chain  and  operational  factors  such  as  purchase  order  management, \nproduction, distribution, sales orders, management, and so on. Within this paper, three \nfactors of potential value chains are identified: \n\n\u2022  Products that have the potential to be exported; \n\n\u2022  The majority of raw materials used for the production come from a local source. \n\nIn other words, the existence of a production supply chain in the country; \n\n\u2022  Many people work in this VC.  \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1019 \n \n\n6.1  Manufacturing Sector \n\nL. Boojoo \n\nMongolia is the second largest producer of cashmere in the world and produces about \n9,500  tons  of  raw  cashmere  per  year,  which  makes  up  28%  of  the  world  production, \nvalued at $368.2 million in total. It provides income and employment for over a third of \nthe  population.  In  the  past,  the  cashmere  industry  has  received  extensive  funds, \nincentives,  and  technical  assistance  from  the  government  and  international  donor \norganizations.  \n\nAccording to the Cashmere and Wool Association, the availability of raw materials is as \nfollows: cashmere \u2012 8,500 tons; camel wool \u2012 1,400 tons; sheep wool \u2012 25,000 tons; yak \nmolts  \u2012  500  tons.

According \nto  a  study  done  by  the  Mongolian  National  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry,  the \ncapacity of companies, which is crucial for production, is as follows:  \n\nFirst Stage \n\u2022  Washing: 100% \n\nSecond Stage \n\u2022  wool carding: 25% \n\nof cashmere \nneeded for \nproduction  \n\nThird Stage \n\u2022  Spinning: 15% of \ncashmere needed \nfor production \n\nFourth Stage \n\u2022  braiding yarn: 10% of \ncashmere needed for \nproduction \n\nOnly a few companies have full capacity until the end of production. Thus, there are two \ntypes of value chains\u2014limited capacity (Figure 10) and full capacity (Figure 11): \n\nFigure 10: Value Chain in Cashmere Sector (Limited Capacity) \n\nNote: PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\n \n\n(in Mongolian). \n\n3   For  information  on  the  Mongolian  wool  and  cashmere  sector,  see  http://mongoltextile.mn/nav/97  \n\n \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1019 \n \n\nSource: Author. \n\nFigure 11: Value Chain in Cashmere Sector (Full Capacity) \n\nL. Boojoo \n\n \n\nSource: Author. \n\nThe  main  export  destination  countries  for  wool  and  cashmere  products  are  the  \nUnited Kingdom, France, the Republic of Korea, and Japan. Twelve companies exported \ngoods worth $4.58 million to the UK, 11 companies exported goods worth $4.87 million \nto  France,  11  companies  exported  goods  worth  $5.56  million  to  Japan,  and  26 \ncompanies  exported  goods  worth  $7.23  million  to  the  Republic  of  Korea  in  2017 \n(Mongolian Wool and Cashmere Association 2018). \n\nThe biggest company in this sector is Gobi Cashmere. Gobi Cashmere was established \nin 1981 with investment from Japan and was privatized in July 2007. Since then it has \nbeen  restructured  and  become  a \nIn  December  2017,  \nit  bought  Goyo  Cashmere  LLC,  which  was  one  of  the  first  factories  established  \nwith  private  investment  in  1993  and  one  of  the  biggest.  Gobi  Cashmere  and  Goyo \nCashmere LLC have a monopoly position in the Mongolian cashmere market, owning \nmore than 70%, and they are part of the Tavan Bogd Group. Gobi Cashmere and Goyo \nCashmere  are  also  factories  that  have  a  full  production  range,  from  washing  to  wool \ncarding, spinning and knitting, braiding yarn, and final products. They sell their products \nin 19 countries.  \n\njoint  stock  company. \n\nThe second biggest cashmere producer, Cashmere Holding, was established in 1994 \nwith the joint investment of a Mongolian company, Altai Holding, and a British company, \nD.B. Holdsworth. D.B. Holdsworth had owned 30% of the shares until 2006 when Altai \nHolding LLC bought back the shares and became the full owner.  \n\nCompanies that operate in the Mongolian cashmere sector face various challenges:  \n\n\u2022  The biggest challenge is that the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) causes price \ndumping of raw cashmere in the world market. Chinese companies also cause \nraw  cashmere  price  hikes  within  the  country  when  trying  to  buy  Mongolian \ncashmere.  As  a  result,  the  price  of  raw  cashmere  increases  every  year, \nburdening \nthe  Mongolian \nlocal  companies.  As  a  countermeasure, \ngovernment gives subsidies in order to get the herders to sell their raw cashmere \nto  domestic  companies.  For  example,  government  subsidies  amounted  to \nMNT22.6 billion in 2016 and MNT22.5 billion in 2017.  \n\nthe \n\n\u2022  The availability of raw cashmere is highly seasonal and possible only in spring, \ntherefore  companies  need  a  huge  amount  of  current  assets.  Furthermore, \nsufficient storage is required to accumulate enough raw cashmere.  \n\n\u2022  Big companies are interested in having a full production range, including washing \n\nand wool carding.  \n\n\u2022  One  corporation  has  a  monopoly  position  in  the  cashmere  sector,  due  to \ninsufficient regulations on fair competition. As a result, Mongolian SMEs will find \nit difficult to develop further.  \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1019 \n \n\nL. Boojoo \n\n\u2022  The fact that herders pay no taxes affects the quality of raw cashmere. There\u2019s \nalso no tax on each livestock, which causes excessive pasture carrying capacity \nand degradation of grazing areas. In recent years, the problems concerning the \npastureland in Mongolia have been discussed a lot.  \n\nThe two biggest cashmere companies, which have a monopoly position in the cashmere \nsector with over 70% of the domestic market share, belong to one company group, which \nowns a bank as well. The fact that the two biggest companies have created a monopoly \nposition in the cashmere sector and a bank operates under the same group makes it \ndoubtful whether principles of fair competition apply in the Mongolian cashmere sector.  \n\nTable 6: SWOT Analysis for the Wool and Cashmere Sector \n\nStrengths \n\u2022  With natural breeding the quality of cashmere \n\nis without chemicals and treatments.  \n\u2022  Government programs, IFIs, and other \n\ncompanies are supporting in-country value-\nadded cashmere processing. \n\n\u2022  Relatively cheaper than other wool and \ncashmere products in the world market. \n\u2022  Mongolian wool and cashmere are durable \n\nand easily refreshed. \n\nWeaknesses \n\n\u2022  High cost of the working capital needed to \n\npurchase stocks of raw cashmere due to the \navailability of raw cashmere for a certain time \nof period. The producers have to buy the stock \nin the spring for the whole year.  \nInconsistent and uneven quality (as reflected \nin the price) of the raw materials, due to \ndecreased fiber quality depending on age of \ngoats. \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  Some brands already have representative \n\noffices and sales agents abroad and are well-\nknown in the world market. \n\n\u2022  Price competition of traders. \n\u2022  Highly seasonal with availability of raw \ncashmere only for a certain period. \n\n\u2022  Exchange rates, especially the depreciation of \nthe national currency, make the products too \ncheap. \n\n\u2022  The quality is declining due to the substantial \nsubsidies from the government such as no \ntaxation for herders, free medical care, no \npension, health, or disability contributions. If \nthe cashmere quality (as measured by fiber \ndiameters) increases, the average yield per \ngoat declines.  \n\n\u2022  Most cashmere is exported with only low value \n\nadded.  \n\nThreats \n\u2022  Mongolia could face big competition from the \nlargest producer of raw cashmere, the PRC. \nSince the Chinese government has subsidized \nits cashmere sector with very low interest rates \nand other programs, the PRC could potentially \ndominate.  \n\n\u2022  About half of Mongolia\u2019s raw cashmere is \nsmuggled to the PRC for processing. \n\n\u2022  Price dumping.  \n\u2022  Natural disasters such as dzuds could cause a \nshortage or even a loss of raw materials. \n\u2022  Ecological imbalance and deterioration in \n\npastureland, due to high growth of goat herds. \n\n\u2022  Degraded cashmere quality due to the rapid \n\ngrowth of the industry. \n\nOpportunities \n\u2022  Demand for, and interest in, ecologically pure, \n\n\u2022 \n\nnaturally made products are increasing \nworldwide. \nIn Europe, Scandinavia, and North America, \nthe market for wool and cashmere products \ncan be expanded, considering the cold, humid \nclimate and higher living standards. \n\nSource: Author. \n \n\n \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1019 \n \n\n6.2  Agricultural Sector \n\nL. Boojoo \n\nThe  Integrated  Mineral  Resource  Initiative  is  a  GIZ  project  in  Mongolia  that  is \nimplemented in four provinces/aimags . Within this project, there has been a value chain \nanalysis of fruit and vegetables.  \n\nThe main export destination countries are Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore, \nand  companies  like  Seaberry,  UFC,  Goo,  and  Lhamour  have  become  relatively  well-\nknown in the world market. The bigger companies are actively involved in improving the \nquality  of  production.  Currently,  the  \u201cFruit  and  Berries\u201d  national  program  is  being \nimplemented to develop the sector. One of the main products is sea buckthorn (Figure \n16). \n\nThere are a total of 54 SMEs processing raw materials and producing final products such \nas  juice,  oil,  and  wine  in  14  sums  of  10  aimags  and  six  districts  of  the  capital  city  of \nMongolia. Factories have two to 50 employees and there are 595 people employed. The \nfactories are capable of processing 500\u2012600 tons of berries yearly, but most of them use \nonly 3.3%\u201250% of their capacities. Currently, 2,041 tons of sea buckthorn are processed \non average (MOFA 2017) . \n\nThe fruit and berries sector in Mongolia has a good base to be developed as a value \nchain, but it requires a long-term development strategy and financial support to develop \nnew technology and products with appropriate standards. \n\nThere are a number of problems that occur along the value chain pathway in the fruit \nand berries sector.  \n\nIngredients and cultivars must remain the same in order to maintain a certain standard \nand quality of products. The biggest problem is the uncertainty concerning the cultivars \nof sea buckthorn. The most suitable and adaptable cultivars in the Mongolian climate \nhave  not  been  identified  yet.  Furthermore,  human  resources  are  one  of  the  biggest \nchallenges,  since  big  companies  or  unions  need  an  agronomist  and  there\u2019s  a  need  \nto  prepare  experts  and  specialized  people  in  this  sector.  There  are  approximately  \n40 factories operating in the sector nationwide, and for these factories, advancement in \ntechnologies and access to financing are crucial. For instance, ca. 30%\u201240% of the total \nharvests are lost during the process of harvesting due to the lack of technologies, since \nthe berries are tightly bunched along the branches, and the harvesting of sea buckthorn \nis  very  difficult  and  requires  certain  equipment.  Therefore,  technologies  such  as \nharvesting  equipment  are  important,  since  harvesting  requires  manual  labor.  In  the \nfuture, the production of sea buckthorn should be automated. \n\nThere is a need to cooperate with national and international research organizations in \norder to improve this sector.  \n\nLong-term  financing  is  required,  because  sea  buckthorn  starts  bearing  fruit  three  to  \nfive  years  after  planting.  To  date,  there  have  been  no  attempts  to  attract  foreign \ninvestments in this sector, which should be considered in the future.  \n\nIn  total,  6,000  ha  have  been  cultivated  and  3,000  tons  of  fruit  and  berries  have  been \nharvested. Various big companies, including Khaan Jims, Kharkhorin, and Tovkhin Jims, \nhave  been  operating  in  this  sector.  There  are  also  many  sea  buckthorn  farming \nhouseholds as a result of the implementation of the \u201cChatsargana\u201d project. For instance, \nin 2017 the Mongolian government provided an area of 10 ha with infrastructure such as \nfences and watering systems in each sum of Bulgan province. One household gets an \narea of 1\u20122 ha to share with others. The production of sea buckthorn can be developed \nfurther following this example. \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1019 \n \n\nL. Boojoo \n\nTable 7: SWOT Analysis for the Fruit and Berries Sector \n\nStrengths \n\u2022  Endemic berries are well adapted to the harsh \n\nMongolian climate.  \n\n\u2022  They are widely used in organic beauty and \n\ntreatment products due to their many \nmedicinal properties, including biological active \nsubstances, vitamins, and mineral elements. \n\u2022  They can be processed into various kinds of \n\nproducts, including food like organic juice, oil, \nbeauty and medicinal products, and so on. \n\nWeaknesses \n\n\u2022  Only a third of sea buckthorn berries are \n\nharvested, due to the lack of technology and \nequipment. \n\n\u2022  The supply of t raw materials is seasonal, thus \n\nscarcity could potentially occur. \n\n\u2022  Lack of knowledge and know-how about \nsapling varieties could be an issue for the \ncultivation of sea buckthorn. \n\n\u2022  There is a small variety of fruit and berries \n\n\u2022  Sea buckthorn is a specific product of \n\navailable. \n\n\u2022  The equipment and technologies used on most \nfarms are ineffective and cause a loss of yield. \n\nMongolia. \n\n\u2022  Various sea buckthorn-related researches \n\nhave been carried out so far and this could be \na good base for the further development of the \nsector. \n\n\u2022  Because of its extensive root system, sea \n\nbuckthorn mitigates against desertification and \nis resistant in drought, which makes it suitable \nfor growing in dry areas like western Mongolia. \n\nOpportunities \n\u2022  The vast expanses of area where the fruit and \n\nberries can be cultivated. \n\n\u2022  There is a great opportunity to further develop \norganic fruit and berry products, since the \nglobal tendency to use organic/eco-products \nhas been increasing. \n\n\u2022  The infection rate of diseases of the sapling  \n\nis low. \n\nSource: Author. \n\n6.3  Service Sector \n\nThreats \n\u2022  Mongolia has 66 million livestock, thus bigger \nplantations of fruits and berries must be \nprotected with wire fencing from animals and \nbirds, which requires a certain amount of \ninvestment. The PRC is presumably the \nbiggest producer and exporter of sea \nbuckthorn in the world, since most of the \nsuppliers of sea buckthorn post on \nwww.alibaba.com and www.zauba.com. This \nmay prevent Mongolia from expanding its sea \nbuckthorn exports. \n\nThe tourism sector is one of the priority sectors of Mongolia. According to the National \nTourism  Association,  there  are  600  companies  (tour  operators)  registered,  with  \n280  active  and  300  tourist  camps  operating.  Mongolia  has  visa-free  regimes  with  \n42 countries to attract more tourists.  \n\nAlthough Mongolia was the host country of ITB 2015, the target to receive one million \ntourists  by  2016\u20122017  couldn\u2019t  be  reached.  The  main  reason  was  that  there  was  no \nadditional infrastructural development carried out within the country, such as increasing \nthe number of flights to and within Mongolia. The tourist companies of Mongolia are part \nof  the  global  value  chains.  They  have  contracts  with  international  companies  offering \ntheir tours through their network.  \n\nAccording to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC 2019), the total contribution \nof tourism to GDP (including wider effects of investments, government spending, supply \nchain, and induced income impacts) was MNT3,774.9 billion or 11.8% of GDP, while the \ndirect contribution of tourism to GDP amounted to MNT1,296.8 billion or 4.1% of GDP \n(rank 110th) in 2017. Thus, the total contribution of the tourism sector to GDP is nearly \nthree times greater than its direct contribution. \n\n19 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1019 \n \n\nL. Boojoo \n\nIncluding \n133,800 jobs and represents 11% of total employment. \n\nindirectly  supported  by \n\njobs \n\nthe \n\nthe  sector, \n\ntourism  accounted \n\nfor  \n\n \n\nTable 8: SWOT Analysis for the Tourism Sector \n\nWeaknesses \n\n\u2022 \n\nInfrastructure not improved, such as additional \ninternational flights, domestic flights, railways \netc. \n\n\u2022  Air market not liberalized therefore expensive.  \n\u2022  There is limited accommodation and much of \nthe accommodation is not of international \nstandard as yet. \n\n\u2022  There are few medical aid centers and \n\nemergency services available in rural areas. \n\u2022  There is relatively little to purchase, especially \nin the tourism and interpretation centers, such \nas food, beverages, postcards, books, \nguidebooks, souvenirs, and the like. \n\n\u2022  Greater levels of interpretation will be needed \nand more interpretation centres must be built, \nespecially at sites such as those occupied by \nancient cities. \n\n\u2022  Signage must be improved and appropriate \n\nenvironmental standards used. \n\n\u2022  Although there is little one can do about the \n\nclimate, it should be recognized that the long, \ncold winters will make much of the tourism \nactivity highly seasonal with consequent \nperiods of little demand for resources and \ninfrastructure. \n\nThreats \n\u2022  The very nature of both desert and grassland \nlandscapes makes any form of development \nhighly conspicuous and there is a great danger \nof poor or inappropriate development ruining \nthe scenic appeal of much of the area. \n\u2022  Care must be exercised to ensure that \n\npollution does not detract from the relatively \npollution-free environment that exists at the \nmoment. \n\n\u2022  Tourism is not the only industry in the region \nand care must be exercised to ensure that \nother industries, especially extractive \nindustries, are not allowed to ruin the tourism \nresource of the region. \n\n\u2022  There is great faith around the world that if one \ndevelops eco-tourism all will be well and little \nharm can occur in the natural environment. \nThere is no guarantee that eco-tourism will be \nbenign and as eco-tourism occurs in some of \nthe world\u2019s most sensitive places the potential \nrisk to the environment is enormous. This \nholds true to Mongolia. \n\nStrengths \n\u2022  The extensive lakes, rivers, streams, and \n\nponds abound with fish and other wildlife and \nhave the potential to attract nature-based and \nmore specifically eco-tourists.  \n\n\u2022  The Gobi Desert located to the south of the \n\nregion enjoys its own special tourist attractions \nand has extensive potential.  \n\n\u2022  A number of historic city sites offer potential if \nproperly protected, signed, and interpreted.  \n\u2022  Genghis Khan is well-known worldwide and \n\noffers much interest to overseas visitors to the \nregion. Marco Polo is also associated with this \narea and therefore provides a link with Europe, \nwhich increases the potential European \ninterest. \n\nOpportunities  \n\u2022  The vast expanses of forest, grassland and \n\ndesert are barely being tapped at present and \nthere are terrific opportunities to develop many \nmore tourist attractions in the future. \n\n\u2022  Whilst Mongolia is a relatively isolated region \nof the world, it is that very isolation that gives \nthe region much of its attraction. \n\n\u2022  Much of the tourism product is based on \n\nnatural and cultural attractions and it is these \ntypes of attraction that are in high demand by \ninternational tourists. Nature-based and eco-\ntourism-based attractions and products are \nexperiencing rapid growth in demand \nworldwide. \n\n\u2022  Cultural attractions are probably in even \n\ngreater demand than natural attractions and \nthere is great opportunity to further develop the \ncultural attractions in the region. \n\n\u2022  Winter sports, winter tourism, and adventure \ntourism, in general, have been identified as a \npotential growth market and there are a lot of \nopportunities to develop this sector a lot \nfurther. \n\nSources: 1. Lkhalkham, Nomin, Onon, and Khaliuna (2018).  \n\n2. ADB (2002). \n\n20 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1019 \n \n\nL. Boojoo \n\nDue to the high volatility of the Mongolian tugrik the tourist companies have to calculate \ntheir prices very carefully. Foreign tourists usually book and pay for their tours at least \nsix months before, therefore the fluctuation of the tugrik against the US dollar can be a \nbig risk. \n\nThe tourism sector is seasonal due to the very cold and harsh winters in Mongolia. The \ntourist season is from June to September each year. Special programs such as winter or \nadventure tourism need to be developed to prolong the season.  \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nIt is impossible to develop the tourism in Mongolia as mass tourism, because only \na  few  people  with  specific  interests  come  to  Mongolia  and  traveling  costs  are \nhigh. The tourism sector faces many other challenges as well.  \n\n\u2022  Due to the underdeveloped infrastructure, there are only domestic flights to a few \n\nprovinces. Furthermore, the flights are relatively expensive.  \n\n\u2022  Another  weakness  is  that  the  healthcare  infrastructure  is  poor.  In  the  case  \nof  an  accident  or  illness  in  the  countryside,  the  injured  person  needs  to  \nbe  transported  to  a  city,  where  advanced  healthcare  is  provided  and  this  \ntakes time.  \n\nIn recent years, travelers riding in their vehicles have come to Mongolia through \nthe Russian Federation. But, due to the poor road infrastructure, there are not \nenough traffic signs. Thus travelers are usually unaware of the distance to the \nnext filling station or directions.  \n\n7.  VALUE CHAIN FINANCING ANALYSIS \n\nThe limited access to the finance the SMEs of Mongolia need hinders them in terms of \ncreating  jobs,  economic  growth,  and  further  developing  their  business.  There  are  no \nvalue  chain  financing  mechanisms  available.  The  bank-dominated  financial  sector  \nof Mongolia offers loans, and deposit and saving products. There is a need to develop \nventure capital, factoring, leasing, overdraft facilities, start-up finance, and other finance \nmechanisms.  \n\nThere are no financial incentives for exporters. \n\n8.  POLICIES TO PROMOTE SME FINANCE \n\nThere  are  different  laws  and  programs  available  to  support  the  development  of  \nSMEs. A credit risk database is available at the Bank of Mongolia, but only banks have \naccess  to  this  database.  Some  of  the  important  and  relevant  laws  and  programs  are \nlisted below. \n\nThe Government of Mongolia has established different funds to provide financial support \nfor SMEs. The following funds are available for SMEs (Table 10).  \n\nThe SME Development Fund was established to support financing for SMEs by providing \nlong-term concessional loans for SME operations, allowing SMEs to access production \nequipment through financial leasing, offering double guarantees for SMEs and promoting \nactivities of subsidized SMEs, organizing workshops and training and operating from the \nMinistry of Food, Agriculture and Light Industry. In the period from 2009 to 2017 the SME \nDevelopment Fund received 26,454 applications. Only 18% or 7,536 were approved and \nthey received a total funding of MNT835.2 billion in concessional loans, or 4.3%\u20126.5% \nof  total  SME  finance.  But  the  government  structure  supporting  SMEs  including  the \n\n21 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1019 \n \n\nL. Boojoo \n\nSMEDF was not sustainable in the past. For instance, the SME fund has operated under \ndifferent  ministries:  From  2012  to  2014  it  operated  under  the  Ministry  of  Economic \nDevelopment, from 2014 to 2016 under the Ministry of Industry, and from 2016 under the \nMinistry of Agriculture and Light Industry. The Ministry of Economic Development was \ndissolved  in  2014  and  the  Ministry  of  Industry  in  2016.  Therefore,  a  long-term \ndevelopment strategy for SMEs is not available. \n\nTable 9: Laws and Policies to Promote SME Finance \n\nYear \nIntroduced/ \nMinistry in \nCharge \n\n \n\nLaw \nLaw on SMEs \n\n2007 \n\nFirst-time definition of SMEs.  \n\nObjectives \n\nShort Assesment \n\nThe definition of SMEs is \nnot widely used by SME \nstakeholders.

Currently,  MNT37.3  billion  \nfor  111  guaranteed  credits  have  been  granted:  84  of  these  guarantees  were  issued  \nin  Ulaanbaatar,  and  27  in  local  areas.  Financed  by  foreign  credits  and  grants,  no \nsubsidiaries from the budget.  \n\nThe CGF is located only in Ulaanbaatar. They cooperate with five commercial banks. If \nthe  collateral  of  an  SME  is  not  enough  to  get  the  credit  they  can  apply  for  a  credit \nguarantee. The usual process is that they have to apply for it at their local bank and the \nbank  submits  the  application  to  the  CGF.  The  CGF  studies  the  application  and \ndocuments submitted. When the CGF approves the application, the bank examines the \nsubmitted documents carefully. The final decision is made by the credit committee of the \nbank.  \n\n9.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nThe main source of funding for SMEs is commercial banks. Loan guarantees are used \nby the government to ease SMEs\u2019 access to finance. Some funds have been established \nto support the development of SMEs.  \n\nAccess to finance and a lack of collateral are important issues for SMEs. The cost of \nfinancing is very high and there are insufficient support and subsidies from government \nagencies. The banking system offers very basic and traditional financing mechanisms, a \nlack of value chain financing, and other risk mechanisms for the exchange rate. \n\nStudies on the financial literacy of SMEs have not been conducted yet. Therefore it is \ndifficult to assess the financial education of SMEs. \n\nThus, the following recommendations can be formulated.  \n\n1.  A proper definition of SMEs is needed with changes to the law. If not, the funding \nfrom  the  SME  Development  Fund  and  others  will  be  misused  in  the  \nlong term.  \n\n2.  A unified database for SMEs is needed in order to obtain accurate statistics and \ndevelop  effective  policy  measures,  and  a  credit  risk  database  is  necessary  to \novercome the problem of information asymmetry faced by SMEs. \n\n3.  Studies on the financial literacy of SMEs are needed to identify their real needs \nand  a  national  financial  literacy  strategy  should  be  developed.  Such  studies \nshould  be  carried  out  on  a  regular  base  to  identify  their  development  and  to \ndevelop focused products for them.  \n\n24 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1019 \n \n\nL. Boojoo \n\n4.  Expansion of the credit guarantee system through special programs for women, \n\npeople with disabilities, etc.  \n\n5.  Improvement of the Bankruptcy Law is needed.  \n\n6.  Implementation of the SME program 2018\u20132020.  \n\n7.  The  banks  should  make  value  collaterals  by  themselves.  The  appraisal  of \ncollaterals  has  to  be  done  by  independent  valuation  companies.  Thus,  such \nregulation is needed.  \n\n8.  Exploring  the  possibilities  of  developing  alternatives  to  bank  lending,  and  \nin  particular  diversifying  the  financial  sector,  such  as  venture  capital, business \nangel  investment,  mezzanine  financing,  crowdfunding,  leasing,  factoring,  and \ngreen financing. Development of the regulatory framework to operate for them.  \n\n9.  Developing programs for the development and finance of value chains based on \n\nstudies on them.  \n\n10. Improving  the  environment  for  fair  competition  through  the  improvement  of \n\nCompetition Law and environment.  \n\n11. Prolonging  the  period  and  extending  the  list  of  equipment  under  the  Law  on \n\nexemption of customs duties and VAT on equipment and spare parts.  \n\n12. A  business  voice  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  border  procedures  \n\nis needed.  \n\n13.

Value  chains  that  have \ntheir  potential  developed  further  are  the  cashmere,  tourism,  fruit,  and  berry  sectors.  Key \nfactors in the development of SMEs in Mongolia are discussed along with factors hindering \ntheir  development.  There  is  no  unified  database  on  SMEs  and  different  organizations  are \nresponsible  for  gathering  data  on  them.  Thus  the  statistics  on  SMEs  are  inconsistent  and \nfragmented. Therefore, it is difficult to present a clear picture of SMEs and make sound policies \nbased on reliable, coherent analysis and data in favor of SMEs. Due to the sparse population, \ntraditional banking services are costly, especially outside of the residential areas. A lack of \nsound credit infrastructure and governmental regulations are the main problems in the credit \nmarket for SMEs. Financial institutions offer only a few available financial products, due to the \nunderdeveloped  Mongolian \nsupport,  \nand the lack of a regulatory framework. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need to:  \n(i)  improve  the  quality  of  data  on  SMEs  and  establish  the  relevance  of  in-depth  study  of \nfinancial literacy to obtain a clear picture of them and develop effective policies; (ii) improve \nthe  regulatory  framework  for  business,  especially  the  fair  competitiveness  regulations;  \n(iii) develop the regulatory framework for other sources of funding; (iv) develop a long-term \nnational program for SMEs. \n \nKeywords: SME sector, financial literacy, financing, global value chain, value chain \nfinancing, agriculture, Mongolia \n \nJEL Classification: D53, G23, L26, Q13, Q14, Q17 \n \n", "government \n", "insufficient \n", "financial \n", "sectors, \n", " \n"]}
