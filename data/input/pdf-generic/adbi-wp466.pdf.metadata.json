INTRODUCTION \nPoverty statistics are the most basic piece of information for assessing the poverty situation \nof  a  country  and  for  formulating  antipoverty  policies.  With  broader  recognition  of  their \nimportance, the availability of poverty statistics has significantly improved over the last 4 \ndecades. The World Bank\u2019s Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) website alone lists \n38 countries with household surveys,1 and many other countries not in the list also routinely \nconduct surveys and publish national poverty statistics without much external assistance.  \nThe quality of poverty statistics has also improved with the accumulation of knowledge and \nexperience. Better survey designs have helped make the measurement of standards of living \nmore accurate and more readily comparable across regions, within a country, and over \nyears. As a result, we have a better understanding of the profile of the poor and its transition \nover time.  \nHowever, in the standard poverty profile approach, it is often unclear what has caused the \nobserved change in poverty. Adding to this problem, the methodology used to derive national \npoverty statistics is not always uniform, making the poverty statistics incomparable across \nregions or over time. To address these issues, we offer a new methodology of poverty \ndecomposition in this paper.2  \nOur method is highly flexible and allows us to decompose the poverty change into several \ncomponents (e.g., growth and redistribution components) for each region or each sector in a \ncountry in a coherent manner. Such decomposition is useful for choosing the appropriate \npolicies to fight poverty. For example, in regions where economic growth is pro-poor but \nslow, policies to enhance regional economic growth (e.g., investment in infrastructure) may \nbe an appropriate poverty reduction policy. On the other hand, in regions with high but anti-\npoor economic growth, distribution-improving policies (e.g., cash transfers) may be more \nappropriate. Our method is easy to implement, especially when a set of simplifying (but \nreasonable) assumptions are made. Our method produces a neat decomposition result that \ndoes not have an interaction term or residual, which is difficult to interpret. Further, as \ndiscussed in section 2, it satisfies two desirable properties of time-reversion consistency and \nsubperiod additivity unlike the existing decomposition methods.  \nWe  apply  our  method  to  the  Philippines  for  three  reasons.  First,  the  poverty  reduction \nprocess in the Philippines has been slower than that of most other countries in Southeast \nAsia. It is therefore useful to identify the sources of slow progress in the Philippines. To this \nend,  we  decompose  the  poverty  change  in  each  region  in  the  Philippines  into  six \ncomponents:  population  shift  (PS),  within-region  redistribution  (WR),  between-region \nredistribution (BR), nominal growth (NG), inflation (IF), and methodological change (MC). Our \ndecomposition shows that most of the poverty reduction achieved by nominal growth is offset \nby inflation and worsening distribution within each region when we look at overall poverty \nchange in the Philippines. Our regional disaggregation results show that the sources of \npoverty change are heterogeneous across regions and thus the suitable poverty reduction \npolicies also vary across regions. For example, we find that growth-enhancing policies are \ndesirable for poverty reduction in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), \nwhereas distribution-improving policies are also important in Region VIII (Eastern Visayas).  \nSecond, the official poverty statistics in the Philippines are calculated with poverty lines that \nare specific to a region or a province. Therefore, the changes in the national statistics reflect \n                                                \n1\n See http://go.worldbank.org/PDHZFQZ6L0 (accessed 1 October 2013). \n2 Here, we are concerned with the case where the reference standards of living at the poverty line are not \ncomparable across time. However, incomparability can occur for other reasons, such as the variations in \nsurvey design over time. See, for example, Lanjouw and Lanjouw (2001). Deaton and Kozel (2005) provide an \noverview of the related debate in India. \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 466                                     Fujii \nnot only the real changes in poverty but also the superficial changes due to the way official \npoverty lines are adjusted over time. By applying our method to the Philippines, we can \nseparate the superficial changes from the observed changes. We find that the slow progress \nin the reduction of official poverty in the Philippines is partly driven by the superficial changes \ndue to the change in methodology.  \nFinally, the Philippines has collected household income data once every 3 years since 1985. \nThis allows us to see the poverty change over a relatively long period of time. Therefore, it is \npossible to see whether the driving force of poverty change has altered over time. We find \nthat worsening distribution severely crippled the progress in poverty reduction in the two \nperiods 1988\u20131991 and 1994\u20131997. In other years, the slow progress in poverty reduction \nwas mainly explained by the lack of high real economic growth.  \nThis  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In  the  next  section,  we  briefly  review  existing \nmethodologies of poverty decomposition and develop a new method of dynamic poverty \ndecomposition. In section 3, we describe the data and discuss some measurement issues. In \nsection 4, we present the decomposition results in the Philippines. Section 5 provides some \ndiscussion.  \n2.  METHODOLOGY \nIn this section, we develop a new method of dynamic poverty decomposition. To highlight the \nnovelty of our method, we first introduce the notations and review the existing methods. We \nthen present our general decomposition method. This method requires that we know the path \nof  the  changes  in  the  components  of  interest  (e.g.,  mean  and  distribution  of  income). \nHowever, this requirement is typically not fulfilled in a practical application. Therefore, we will \nconsider two sets of assumptions that allow us to implement the method in a straightforward \nmanner.  \nIn section 2.3, we consider a simple linear approximation, in which the relative poverty line \n(poverty line relative to the mean income) and the cumulative distribution function of the \nrelative  income  (individual  income  relative  to  the  mean  income)  change  linearly.  This \nassumption leads to a very simple expression when the poverty measure of interest is the \npoverty rate.  \nIn section 2.4, we consider a log-linear approximation as an alternative to the simple linear \napproximation. We use a linear approximation for the logarithmic relative poverty line and \ndistribution of the logarithmic relative income. This approach also has some attractions as it \nhas some connections with pro-poor growth literature. With either the linear or log-linear \nassumption, the poverty decomposition can be implemented easily. We then vary the speed \nof  change  in  the  mean  income  relative  to  that  of  the  income  distribution  to  check  the \nrobustness of the linear approximation.  \nIn  section 2.6,  we  consider  an  extension  of  the  method  with  six  components.  Each \ncomponent can be further divided by groups such as regions or sectors. This extension helps \nresearchers and policy makers decide what poverty reduction policies are suitable for each \ngroup. Finally, we discuss some implementation issues. \n2.1  Notations and Existing Methods \nWe assume that the individual-level poverty measure is determined by the individual income \nand poverty line. The nominal income per capita   has a positive infimum,3 which is denoted \nby  , and the income distribution at time   for the population of interest is given by the \n                                                \n3\n For most of our discussion, we only require that the nominal income is non-negative. Positive infimum is only \nnecessary in section 2.4. \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 466                                     Fujii \nprobability  density  function  (   ).  The  corresponding  cumulative  distribution  function  is \ndenoted by  (   ), which satisfies  (   )     for all   because of the positive infimum. The \npoverty line at time  , or the threshold income level below which the individual is deemed \npoor, is denoted by  ( )(   ).  \nWith some slight abuse of notation, we consider a class of poverty measures   that has the \nfollowing form:  \nz(t)\n  M(t) \uf0ba M(F(\uf0d7\uf02ct)\uf02cz(t)) \uf0ba \uf0f2 g(y\uf02fz(t))f(y\uf02ct)dy\uf02c          (1) \n0\nwhere the function  ( ) represents the individual-level poverty measure, which we assume is \ndifferentiable at any point on the unit interval except for 0. The class of poverty measures \ndefined in equation (1) is additively decomposable. That is, the poverty measure for any \ngroup  can  be  expressed  as  the  mean  of  subgroup  poverty  measures  weighted  by  the \nsubgroups\u2019 population shares. This is a useful property for poverty analysis, because it \nallows  us  to  identify  the  major  contributing  groups  to  poverty.  Further,  additive \ndecomposability is not a restrictive requirement, because any poverty measure that satisfies \nthe subgroup consistency\u2014a property that requires the group poverty measure to increase \nwhenever the poverty measure for any of its subgroups increases\u2014can be expressed as a \nmonotonic transformation of an additively decomposable measure (Foster and Shorrocks \n1991).  \nThe Foster\u2013Greer\u2013Thorbecke (FGT) measure (Foster, Greer, and Thorbecke 1984), which is \nthe most popular measure in the recent poverty literature, is a special case of equation (1) \nwith  ( \u0303)  (   \u0303) , where  \u0303    \u2044  is the income normalized by the poverty line and  (   ) \nis a parameter. The Watts measure (Watts 1968) is also a special case of equation (1) with  \n ( \u0303)      \u0303. While the Watts measure is not as widely used in applied research as the FGT \nmeasure, it follows from a set of reasonable axioms (Zheng 1993; Tsui 1996) and is closely \nrelated to our decomposition analysis as shown in section 2.4. The Chakravarty measure \n(Chakravarty 1983) can also be obtained as a special case of equation (1) by letting  ( \u0303) \n   \u0303 , where   is a parameter. \nBecause   is  independent  of   in  equation (1),  a  number  of  other  poverty  indices  are \nexcluded  from  consideration,  including  those  proposed  by  Sen  (1976),  Kakwani  (1980), \nTakayama (1979), and Clark, Hemming, and Ulph (1981). While it is possible to modify our \nanalysis to let   depend on F , we maintain the independence for the sake of simplicity of \npresentation. \nIn what follows, we focus on the FGT and Watts measures, which are denoted by   and   \n  \nwith the following definitions, respectively:  \n\uf061\nz\uf0e6 y\uf0f6\n  P (F\uf02cz) \uf0ba \uf0f2 1\uf02d dF                 (2) \n\uf0e7 \uf0f7\n\uf061 0 \uf0e8 z \uf0f8\nz z\nW(F\uf02cz) \uf0ba \uf0f2 ln dF\uf02e                 (3) \n0 y\nWe shall refer to the FGT measure with parameter 0, 1, and 2 as poverty rate (  ), poverty \n \ngap (  ), and poverty severity (  ), respectively.  \n   \nTo conduct poverty decomposition, it is useful to introduce a few additional notations. We \n \ndenote the mean income at time   by  ( )   \u222b   (   )  , the relative income by  \u0303    \u2044 ( ) \n   \nand  the  relative  poverty  line  by  \u0303    \u2044 ( ).  Here,  the  tilde  notations ( \u0303 )are  used  to \nemphasize  that  the  quantity  is  relative  to  the  population  mean.  The  probability  density \nfunction of the relative income is  \u0303( \u0303  ), which satisfies  \u0303( \u0303  )    ( ) (   ) for all   and  , \nand the corresponding cumulative distribution function is  \u0303. It is straightforward to show \n ( (   )  ( ))   ( \u0303(   )  \u0303( )).  \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 466                                     Fujii \nThe purpose of poverty decomposition is to attribute the actual poverty change   (     ) \n   \n (  )  (  ) to  the  components  of  interest,  such  as  the  growth  and  redistribution \n   \ncomponents. Formally, we define poverty decomposition as follows:  \nDefinition 1. Let C be the index set for the components of interest and     be the \ncontribution of component  (   ) to the poverty change. The pair (  {   (     )}   )  \nis called a poverty decomposition for the poverty change between        and        \n   \nwhen   (     ) \u2211    (     ).  \n         \nOne  of  the  most  popular  decomposition  methods  was  proposed  by  Datt  and  Ravallion \n(1992), which has been used in a number of studies, including Ravallion and Huppi (1991), \nGrootaert (1995), and Sahn and Stifel (2000). The Datt\u2013Ravallion (DR) decomposition uses \nthe initial time point    as the reference time point. In their study, the poverty line,  , is fixed. \n \nTherefore, the change in the relative poverty line,z, is driven only by the change in mean \nincome (i.e., growth). By fixing either the relative poverty line or relative income distribution \nand  letting  the  other  change,  we  can  decompose  the  poverty  change  into  the  growth \ncomponent     and redistribution component     in the following manner with the notations \n     \nintroduced above:4  \n\uf044GRM(t \uf02ct ) \uf03d M(F \uf02cz )\uf02dM(F \uf02cz )\nDR 0 1 0 1 0 0\n\uf044RDM(t \uf02ct ) \uf03d M(F \uf02cz )\uf02dM(F \uf02cz )  \nDR 0 1 1 0 0 0\n\uf044RSM(t \uf02ct ) \uf03d \uf044M(t \uf02ct )\uf02d\uf044GRM(t \uf02ct )\uf02d\uf044RDM(t \uf02ct )\uf02c\nDR 0 1 0 1 DR 0 1 DR 0 1 ,\nwhere  \u0303 ( )   \u0303(    ) and  \u0303(  )   \u0303  for    {   } are the (relative) income distribution and \n       \npoverty line at time   , respectively.  \n \nThe  residual  term      captures  the  poverty  change  not  explained  by  the  growth  and \n  \nredistribution  components.  It  captures  the  interaction  between  growth  and  redistribution \ncomponents and can be interpreted as the difference between the growth [redistribution] \ncomponents  evaluated under the  terminal  and  initial  relative  income distributions  [mean \nincomes] (Datt and Ravallion 1992).  \nWhile setting the reference time point at the initial point is a natural choice, the presence of \nthe  residual  term  undermines  the  usefulness  of  the  decomposition  analysis.  This  is \nparticularly true when the residual term is large in absolute value. As Baye (2006) argues, \nknowledge  of  how  much  of  observed  changes  in  poverty  are  due  to  changes  in  the \nredistribution as distinguished from growth in average incomes is critical for public policy and \ndebate. Thus, if most of the poverty change is inexplicable, the decomposition results do not \ngive much useful information to the policy makers.  \nWe can easily avoid this problem if we are willing to assume that the change in mean income \nand distribution occurs in a certain sequence. In this case, we attribute the residual term to \neither the growth or redistribution component in effect. For example, Kakwani and Subbarao \n(1990) implicitly assume that the growth takes place first and the redistribution second, and \nthus     is attributed to the redistribution component in their decomposition. On the other \n  \nhand, Jain and Tendulkar (1990) consider a decomposition in which redistribution takes \nplace first and growth second. Formally, the Kakwani\u2013Subbarao (KS) and Jain\u2013Tendulkar \n(JT) decompositions are defined as follows:  \n                                                \n4\n Datt and Ravallion (1992) use a discrete time model. On the other hand, our presentation is based on a \ncontinuous time model. However, this distinction makes no essential difference. The same remark applies to \nother decomposition methods discussed in this subsection. \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 466                                     Fujii \n \n \nHowever, the KS and JT decompositions are also unsatisfactory because the assumptions \nabout the sequence of change are arbitrary. Furthermore, neither the DR, the KS, nor the JT \ndecomposition satisfies the time-reversion consistency defined below:  \nDefinition 2. The decomposition (  {   (     )}   ) is time-reversion consistent \nwhen    (     )    (     )    for all  ,   , and   .  \n           \nThe time-reversion consistency requires that when the poverty line and income distribution \nrevert from the terminal state ( \u0303   \u0303 ) to the original state ( \u0303   \u0303 ), the reverse decomposition \n       \nyields the same decomposition result except that each component has the opposite sign.  \nTo see why the time-reversion consistency is a reasonable requirement, imagine that you are \na time traveler. You start the travel at        and end at       . You observe all the changes \n   \nbetween        and       , and conduct the poverty decomposition. Now, you return from \n   \n       and        along the same path of change such that you experience all the changes \n   \nbackwards. If the time-reversion consistency is not satisfied, some components contribute \neither positively or negatively to the poverty measure during the entire time travel, even \nthough all the changes that you have experienced during the \u201coutgoing\u201d travel have been \ncancelled during the \u201creturn\u201d travel.  \nOne way to obtain a time-reversion consistent decomposition is to take the average of KS \nand  JT  decompositions.  This  is  the  average  of  all  possible  sequences  (i.e.,  growth-\nredistribution and redistribution-growth in the standard two-way decomposition). Because this \ndecomposition is essentially based on the average of the marginal contributions of each \ncomponent in all the possible sequences, it is similar to the Shapley solution in cooperative \ngames  and  thus  called  the  Shapley  decomposition  (Kolenikov  and  Shorrocks  2005; \nMaasoumi and Mahmoudi 2013). Formally, each component in the Shapley decomposition is \ndefined as follows:  \n\uf044cM(t \uf02ct )\uf0ba(\uf044c M(t \uf02ct )\uf02b\uf044c M(t \uf02ct ))\uf02f2,  \nS 0 1 KS 0 1 JT 0 1\nwhere    {     }.  \nIt is straightforward to verify that the Shapley decomposition is a time-reversion consistent \ndecomposition (see also Kakwani 2000). Unlike KS and JT decompositions, the Shapley \ndecomposition  can  also  be  extended  to  the  case  of  multiple  components.  Son  (2003) \nproposes  a  four-component  Shapley-type  decomposition  method  applied  to  the  rate  of \npoverty change for a general poverty measure.  \nThese features of the Shapley decomposition are attractive. However, as with DR, KS, and \nJT decompositions, it does not satisfy the subperiod additivity defined below:  \nDefinition 3. Assume that we have observations of the poverty measure and other \nrelevant parameters at time                in the time period between        and \n       \n        with                           . Then, the decomposition (  {   (     )}   )  \nis subperiod additive when the following equation is satisfied for all     :  \nD\n  \uf044cM(t \uf02ct ) \uf03d\uf0e5\uf044cM(s \uf02cs )\uf02e                       (4) \n0 1 d\uf02d1 d\nd\uf03d1\n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 466                                     Fujii \nThe subperiod consistency requires that the poverty change due to a particular component \nfor  two  contiguous  subperiods  is  equal  to  the  sum  of  the  poverty  change  due  to  that \ncomponent in each subperiod.5  \nDatt and Ravallion (1992) propose to address this problem by fixing the reference time point \n    [     ] for the decomposition of all subperiods. This approach, however, is not ideal \n   \nbecause the reference period lies outside most of the subperiods. Kakwani (2000) proposes \nanother method to address this issue but his method is also unsatisfactory because an \nadditional observation changes the decomposition results for all subperiods. In the next \nsubsection, therefore, we propose a simple decomposition method that addresses all the \nissues mentioned above. \n2.2  New Method of Dynamic Poverty Decomposition \nTo  derive  a  decomposition  method  that  is  residual-free,  time-reversion  consistent,  and \nsubperiod additive, we can first consider an infinitesimal change of M(t) with respect to \ntime t and find growth and redistribution components for this change. This allows us to \nignore  the  (second-order)  interaction  effect  so  that  the  results  are  residual-free.  By \nintegrating each component over the time interval of interest, we obtain the growth and \nredistribution  components.  Because  the  reference  time  point  is  already  built-in  in  this \ndecomposition  method,  our  method  is  clearly  time-reversion  consistent.  The  subperiod \nadditivity follows from the property of integration. Despite this simplicity of the method, this is \nthe first paper to employ time derivative and integration to poverty decomposition.6  \nUsing the notations introduced in Section 2.1, we can obtain the following results:7  \nProposition 1. Let     {     } and define the following:  \nt \uf0e9 z \uf0e6 y\uf0f6\uf0b6f(y\uf02ct) \uf0f9\n  \uf044RDM(t \uf02ct ) \uf0ba \uf0f21 \uf0ea\uf0f2 g\uf0e7 \uf0f7 dy\uf0fadt                   (5) \n\uf02a 0 1 t0 \uf0eb 0 \uf0e8 z \uf0f8 \uf0b6t \uf0fb\nt \uf0e9 z \uf0e6 y\uf0f6 y \uf0f9dz\n  \uf044GRM(t \uf02ct ) \uf0ba \uf0f21 \uf0eag(1)f(z\uf02ct)\uf02d\uf0f2 g\uf0a2\uf0e7 \uf0f7 f(y\uf02ct)dy\uf0fa dt\uf02e        (6) \n\uf02a 0 1 t0 \uf0eb 0 \uf0e8 z \uf0f8z2 \uf0fb dt\nThen,  the  pair   (  {   (     )} ) is  a  time-reversion consistent  and  subperiod-\n       \nadditive poverty decomposition.  \nFour points are in order. First, we chose to use the cumulative distribution function of the \nrelative income  \u0303 to represent our decomposition. In a number of previous studies of poverty \ndecomposition, however, the Lorenz curve has been used. Because the Lorenz curve and  \u0303 \ncarry the same information, we can rewrite equations (5) and (6) using the Lorenz curve. \nHowever, we choose to use  \u0303 for simplicity of presentation.  \nSecond, it is straightforward to verify that     (     )    holds when  \u0303( \u0303  ) is constant \n     \nover    [     ] for given  \u0303. In other words,      is driven by the changes in the distribution \n     \nand thus we call it the redistribution component. Similarly, we have     (     )    if  \u0303 is \n       \nconstant over  . In line with the previous studies, we call      the growth component, even \n \nthough it is driven by the changes in both   and  . The reason that we do so is that all the \n                                                \n5\n If we allow   to be outside the interval between    and    and    (     ) is continuous, then time-reversion \n       \nconsistency follows from subperiod additivity. To see this, first let      . Then, we must have    (     )    \n       \nby eq. (4). By letting           and      , we have      (     )    (     )  , proving the claim. \n                 \n6\n In the context of source decomposition of changes in inequality, Okamoto (2011) proposes an integration-based \napproach to justify Shapley-type decomposition.  \n7\n All the proofs are provided in Appendix B. \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 466                                     Fujii \nchanges are due to growth (change in the mean income) once the poverty line is fixed, which \nis what is assumed in most previous studies on poverty decomposition.  \nThird, the first [second] term in the integral in      in equation (5) represents the change in \n \npoverty in the extensive [intensive] margin of poverty. The second term is 0 for the poverty \nrate measure and the first term is 0 for the Watts measure and the FGT measure with      . \nTherefore, in our applications, only one of these two terms matters.  \nFourth,  equations (5)  and (6)  show  that      and      include  both  \u0303and  \u0303  in  their \n   \nintegrations and thus depend on the way  \u0303 and  \u0303 vary between       and       . This means \n   \nthat the decomposition is path-dependent. Therefore, to implement equations (5) and (6), we \nneed the observation of  \u0303 and  \u0303 over     [     ] in general.  \n   \nIn a typical application, however, we observe them only at the beginning and end of the time \ninterval (i.e.,        and       ) and possibly a few other time points in between. Therefore, \n   \nwe need to make some assumptions about the path to make the decomposition operational. \nOnce the assumptions are made, we can calculate the integrals in equations (5) and (6) by \nnumerical integration for a general form of  \u0303 and  \u0303.  \nIn each of the next two subsections, we make a set of specific assumptions about the path of \n \u0303 and  \u0303. In each case, they simultaneously and smoothly change over time, which is more \nrealistic than the sequential changes (implicitly) assumed in the DR, KS, JT, and Shapley \ndecompositions. We show that our assumptions lead to a convenient expression that does \nnot require numerical integration. \n2.3  Poverty Rate Decomposition under Linear Approximation \nIn this subsection, we assume that both  \u0303 and  \u0303 vary linearly between        and       . This \n   \nassumption  is  not  very  restrictive,  because  it  can  be  interpreted  as  taking  a  first-order \napproximation  to  an  unknown  functional  form  of  \u0303 and  \u0303 with  respect  to  .  We  define \n \u0303    \u0303(  ) and  \u0303 ( )    \u0303(    ) for    {   } to simplify the expressions below. For example,  \u0303  \n         \nand  \u0303  are the relative poverty lines at the initial and terminal time points, respectively. Using \n \nthese notations, our linearity assumption is as follows:  \nAssumption 1. For      [     ],  \u0303 and  \u0303 respectively satisfy the following equations:  \n   \nF(y\uf02ct)\uf03d(1\uf02d\uf074)F (y)\uf02b\uf074F (y) (7) \n0 1            \n  z(t)\uf03d(1\uf02d\uf074)z \uf02b\uf074z \uf02c              (8) \n0 1\nwhere         .  \n     \nWe focus on the poverty rate measure    because it is the most frequently used measure of \n \npoverty in the literature and leads to a final expression that is simple and easy to implement, \nas shown in the following proposition:  \nProposition  2.  Suppose  that  Assumption 1,  \u0303    \u0303 ,  and        hold.  Then,  the \n     \npoverty decomposition given in Proposition 1 can be written as follows:  \nz P(F \uf02cz )\uf02dz P(F \uf02cz )\uf02dz P(F \uf02cz )\uf02b z P(F \uf02cz )\n  \uf044RDM(t \uf02ct ) \uf03d 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0     (9) \nl\uf02a 0 1 z \uf02dz\n1 0\n  \uf044GRM(t \uf02ct )\uf03d P(F \uf02cz )\uf02dP(F \uf02cz )\uf02d\uf044RDM(t \uf02ct )\uf02e            (10) \nl\uf02a 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 \uf02a 0 1\nWe added the subscript   to the left-hand-side variable to emphasize that this is the linear \napproximation. In equation (9),   ( \u0303   \u0303 ) for    {   }  and    {   }  is simply the poverty \n     \ngap  calculated  with  the  relative  income  distribution  for        and  relative  poverty  line \n \nfor       . In equation (10),   ( \u0303   \u0303 ) for    {   }  is just the poverty rate at       . Therefore, \n         \n9 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 466                                     Fujii \nequations  (9)  and (10)  can  be  implemented  without  any  special  software  package  and \nwithout numerical integration.  \nIt should be noted that equations (9) and (10) do not satisfy the subperiod additivity. That is, \nwe have     (     )       (     )     (     ) in general. The reason for this is that the \n                    \nleft-hand side of this equation is based on the assumption that  \u0303 and  \u0303 change linearly \nbetween    and   , whereas the right-hand side is based on the assumption that they change \n   \nlinearly piecewise between    and    and between    and   .  \n       \nThis breakdown of the subperiod additivity is not an undesirable property. The discussion \nabove shows that we should generally prefer     (     )     (     )  over     (     ) in \n                    \nthe absence of other information, because the piecewise linear approximation is likely to \nproduce more accurate approximation to the underlying path of change than the na\u00efve linear \napproximation  between    and   .  This  argument  does  not  immediately  apply  to  other \n   \ndecompositions. That is, for    {          }, it is not immediately apparent whether we \nshould favor    (     )    (     ) over    (     ) because the former entails an implicit \n                 \nchange in the reference period or the sequence of change. For example, in the case of   , \nthe former uses two different reference time periods;    for the poverty change between \n \n   and    and    for the change between    and   .  \n         \nIn Proposition 2, we excluded the possibility of  \u0303   \u0303 . If equation (8) and  \u0303    \u0303  hold, we \n       \nhave   \u0303( )\u2044       for     [     ]  and thus          and          . Since this is not an \n         \ninteresting case, we excluded this possibility in Proposition 2. However, it should be noted \nthat  \u0303    \u0303  does not imply          in general without the linearity assumption.   \n       \nFigure 1 is useful for interpreting the decomposition results given in equations (9) and (10) \nand for comparing our method with previously proposed methods. The figure provides a \ngraphical representation of the cumulative distribution function of relative income and the \nrelative poverty line at        and       . The lengths of line segments    and    respectively \n   \nrepresent the poverty rate at        and       , or   ( \u0303   \u0303 ) and   ( \u0303   \u0303 ). Therefore, poverty \n               \nhas worsened between these two time periods in this figure. The capital letters   to   are \nused to represent an area defined by bold lines. Note that areas   and   include some parts \nof the shaded areas.  \nFigure 1: Graphical Representation of Poverty Rate Decomposition  \nunder Assumption 1 \n \nSource: Author\u2019s own illustration. \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 466                                     Fujii \nThe goal of a conventional two-way poverty decomposition is to split the line segment    into \nthe growth and redistribution components. If the changes in the relative poverty line and the \nrelative income distribution take place sequentially, this decomposition is straightforward \nbecause we only need to look at one component at a time. In this case, the redistribution \n[growth] component measures the effect of the change in the relative income distribution [the \nrelative  poverty  line].  Graphically,  the  redistribution  component  is  the  vertical  distance \nbetween the two cumulative distributions  \u0303  and  \u0303  at a particular  \u0303, whereas the growth \n   \ncomponent is the difference in a particular cumulative distribution between  \u0303  and  \u0303 .  \n   \nIf we assume that the change in the relative poverty line precedes [follows] the change in the \nrelative  income  distribution,  we  obtain  the  KS  [JT]  decomposition.  The  growth  and \nredistribution components are the lengths of line segments    [  ] and    [  ], respectively, \nin Figure 1. In the case of the DR decomposition, the growth and redistribution component \nare    and   , respectively, and the residual component is what is not explained by these \nterms, which is         . The Shapley decomposition is simply the average of the KS \nand JT decompositions, respectively.  \nTo  interpret  equation (9),  first  note  that  \u0303   ( \u0303   \u0303 )represents  the  average  shortfall  per \n       \nperson from the poverty line relative to the mean income. Therefore,  \u0303   ( \u0303   \u0303 ) is the area \n       \nbelow the cumulative distribution function  \u0303  and to the left of  \u0303  (see also equation (B2) in \n   \nAppendix B). For example,  \u0303   ( \u0303   \u0303 ) is the area of   and   combined. It is straightforward \nto verify that the numerator of the right-hand side of equation (9) is area  . By dividing this \narea by  \u0303   \u0303 , we see that the redistribution component is represented by the vertical \n   \ndistance between  \u0303  and  \u0303  averaged over  \u0303   { \u0303   \u0303 }. Suppose now that the redistribution \n       \ncomponent is    in Figure 1. Then, the shaded parallelogram has the same area as  . \nEquation (10) shows that the growth component is the part of poverty change not accounted \nfor by the redistribution component, which is    in Figure 1.  \nFigure 1 also allows us to show the relationship between the Shapley decomposition and our \ndecomposition. While taking the average of possible sequential changes appears arbitrary, \nour results show that it is not completely unreasonable. To see this, first note that we obtain \nthe Shapley redistribution component if we replace the numerator of equation (9) by the area \nof the trapezoid (not explicitly drawn) with two bases    and   . Therefore, we can consider \nthe  Shapley  decomposition  as  a  way  to  approximate  the  area   by  this  trapezoid.  In \nparticular,  if the  cumulative  distribution functions  \u0303  and  \u0303  are  linear  between  \u0303    \u0303 and \n     \n \u0303    \u0303 ,  the  Shapley  decomposition  is  exactly  equal  to  our  linear  approximation  in \n \nProposition 2.  \n2.4  Poverty Rate Decomposition under Log-Linear Approximation \nAssumption 1 may be reasonable when the change in  \u0303 is relatively small. However, when \nthe economy is experiencing rapid economic growth for a long period of time, the linearity \nassumption in Assumption 1 may not be appropriate. In such a case, we may be able to \nobtain  a  better  approximation  by  making  a  linear  approximation  with  respect  to  the \nlogarithmic relative income  \u0303      \u0303 and logarithmic relative poverty line  \u0303     \u0303. Therefore, \nwe make the following assumption in this subsection:  \nAssumption 2. Let the cumulative distribution function of  \u0303 at time   be  \u0303( \u0303  ). For \n    [     ],  \u0303 and  \u0303 respectively satisfy the following equations:  \n   \n\uf046(\uf068\uf02ct)\uf03d(1\uf02d\uf074)\uf046 (\uf068)\uf02b\uf074\uf046 (\uf068)                       (11) \n0 1\n\uf07a(t)\uf03d(1\uf02d\uf074)\uf07a \uf02b\uf074\uf07a\uf02c                                 (12) \n0 1\nwhere \uf074\uf0ba t\uf02dt0 , \uf046 (\uf068)\uf0ba\uf046(\uf068\uf02ct ), and \uf07a \uf0ba\uf07a(t ) for a\uf0ce{0\uf02c1}.  \nt1\uf02dt0 a a a a\n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 466                                     Fujii \nAssumption 2 is identical to Assumption 1 except that relative income distribution and relative \npoverty line are expressed in logarithmic form. As with Section 1, we focus on the poverty \nrate measure in this subsection. Under Assumption 2, we have the following results:  \nProposition  3.  Suppose  that  Assumption 2  and       hold.  Then,  the  poverty \n \ndecomposition given in Proposition 1 can be written as follows:  \nW(F \uf02cz )\uf02dW(F \uf02cz )\uf02dW(F \uf02cz )\uf02bW(F \uf02cz )\n  \uf044RDM(t \uf02ct ) \uf03d 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0          (13) \nll\uf02a 0 1 \uf07a \uf02d\uf07a\n1 0\n  \uf044GRM(t \uf02ct )\uf03d P(F \uf02cz )\uf02dP(F \uf02cz )\uf02d\uf044RDM(t \uf02ct )\uf02e                   (14) \nll\uf02a 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 ll\uf02a 0 1\nIn  Figure 2,  we  provide  a  graphical  representation  of  the  poverty  decomposition  under \nAssumption 2, which is similar to Figure 1. One important difference is, however, that the \narea below  \u0303  and to the right of  \u0303  represents the Watts measure  ( \u0303   \u0303 ), because the \n       \nWatts  measure  is  the  cumulative  gap  between  the  logarithmic  poverty  line  and  the \nlogarithmic income (see also equation (20) in Appendix B). Therefore, the numerator of the \nright-hand side of equation (13) is area   and      is the vertical distance between  \u0303  and \n     \n \u0303  averaged over  \u0303   [ \u0303   \u0303 ].  \n     \nFigure 2: Graphical Representation of Poverty Rate Decomposition  \nunder Assumption 2 \n \nSource: Author\u2019s own illustration \nFigure 2 also helps us to understand the relationship between our poverty decomposition \nanalysis and pro-poor growth. Notice first that  \u0303  ( ) for     {   } is the 100p-percentile \n \nlogarithmic income. Therefore, the growth incidence curve proposed by Ravallion and Chen \n(2003), which is the growth of income for each quantile, appears as the horizontal distance \nbetween  \u0303  ( ) and  \u0303  ( ) in Figure 2.8 In the graph,    ( ) is negative because  \u0303  ( )  \n     \nis to the left of (i.e., smaller than)  \u0303  ( ). An overall measure of pro-poor growth proposed \n \nby Son and Kakwani (2008, equation (13)) is the integral of    ( )  over the unit interval. \nThis simply appears as the net area between  \u0303  and  \u0303 , which is negative in Figure 2. \n   \n                                                \n8\n Ravallion and Chen (2003) uses a discrete time model and their growth rate is the growth per period. The \ngrowth in Figure 2 also refers to the growth in the time period between      and      and is expressed as a \n   \ndifference in the logarithmic income per capita. \n12 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 466                                     Fujii \n2.5  Robustness Check with a Speed of Change Parameter \nThe KS and JT decompositions implicitly assume that the mean and distribution of income \nchange  sequentially.  The  RD  and  Shapley  decompositions  do  not  impose  a  particular \nsequence, but their calculations are also based on some sequential changes. Our results \npresented in sections 2.3 and 2.4, on the other hand, are based on the assumption that both \nchange simultaneously and smoothly, which is more realistic.  \nHowever,  one  could  argue  that  Assumption 1  is  strong  because  both  relative  income \ndistribution and relative poverty line are assumed to change at the \u201csame speed.\u201d Therefore, \nwe relax Assumption 1 and replace equation (8) with the following equation:  \nz(t)\uf03d(1\uf02d\uf074\uf067)z \uf02b\uf074\uf067z \uf02c                         (15) \n0 1\nwhere  (   ) is the parameter that describes the speed of change for  \u0303 relative to  \u0303. When   \nis large, most of the changes in  \u0303 occur when  \u0303 is already close to  \u0303 . In fact, when we let \n \n    , the decomposition converges to the JT decomposition. On the other hand, when we \nlet      , the decomposition converges to the KS decomposition. Therefore, by varying  , we \ncan check the robustness of the results in Proposition 2. It is also possible to do a similar \nrobustness  check  for  Proposition 3  by  replacing     with      in  the  right-hand  side  of \nequation (12).  \n2.6  Extension to Six-Way Decomposition \nIn this subsection, we consider a more detailed decomposition, in which the poverty change \nin each group in the population is decomposed into six components. While each group \nrepresents a region in our application, it may represent other household characteristics such \nas the household size and the sector in which the household head works. Our decomposition \nis useful because researchers and policy makers are often interested in finding which group \nis contributing to national poverty change and why. While we consider a particular six-\ncomponent decomposition, our decomposition can be easily modified to have more or fewer \ncomponents.  \nIt should also be noted that our decomposition presented in Proposition 4 below can be \nconsidered as an integration of the sector-based decomposition proposed by Ravallion and \nHuppi (1991) and the growth-redistribution decomposition discussed earlier. Unlike Ravallion \nand Huppi (1991), however, our decomposition does not have an interaction term, whose \ninterpretation  is  not  straightforward.  Therefore,  our  results  allow  researchers  and  policy \nmakers to identify the source of poverty change more easily and more clearly.  \nWe hereafter assume that there are   groups (e.g., regions or sectors) in the country and \neach group   has a group-specific poverty line   ( ) at time  . We further assume that the \ngroup-specific poverty lines satisfy      \u2211    ( )  ( ), where   ( ) and   ( ) are the price \n           \nand quantity of good     {     } consumed by a typical household near the poverty line in \ngroup  . Therefore, the poverty lines may change not only by the changes in prices but also \nby the changes in the underlying bundle of goods.  \nWe denote the population share of group   by   . The income distribution of group   has the \nprobability density function    and cumulative distribution function   . Therefore, we have:  \n  f(y\uf02ct)\uf03d\uf0e5wg(t)f g(y\uf02ct) and F(y\uf02ct) \uf03d\uf0e5wg(t)Fg(y\uf02ct)          (16) \ng g\nfor all   and  . We denote the mean income for group   at time   by   ( )  \u222b    (   )    \n   \nand its ratio to the population mean by  \u0302 ( )     ( )\u2044 ( ). We denote the income relative to \nthe  group  mean  by  \u0302    \u2044   and  the  poverty  line  relative  to  the  group  mean  by  \u0302   \n \n  \u2044       \u2044  \u0302 .  The  relative  income  distribution  for  group   is  characterized  by  the \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 466                                     Fujii \nprobability density function  \u0302 , which satisfies  \u0302 ( \u0302  )       (   ) for all  .

Then,  the  pair  (  {     (     )}   )  is  a  time-reversion \nconsistent and subperiod-additive poverty decomposition.  \nThe first component,       is the population-shift component because it accounts for the \n  \npoverty changes due to the changes in the relative size of each group. The population-shift \ncomponent represents both inter-group migration and differences in the mortality and fertility \nacross  groups.  When       ,  the  population-shift  component  positively  contributes  to \n \npoverty reduction when the size of wealthier groups grows faster than the size of poorer \ngroups. For example, if we define groups to be urban and rural areas, we can measure the \ndemographic effect of urbanization on poverty by the population-shift component.  \nThe second component,       is the within-group redistribution component, which accounts \n  \nfor the poverty change due to the change in the relative income distribution in each group. \nThe third component,       is the between-group redistribution component, because it is \n  \ndriven by the change in the ratio of the group-level mean income to the population mean.  \nThe  fourth  component,       can  be  called  the  nominal  growth  component  because  it \n  \nrepresents the change in poverty due to the change in the nominal mean income. The fifth \ncomponent,       can be considered the inflation component, because it represents the \n  \npoverty change due to the changes in the price of the bundle of goods for the poverty line. \nThe sixth component,       can be called the methodological change component, because \n  \nthis is the poverty change due to the quantity changes in the underlying bundle of goods for \nthe poverty line. The fifth and sixth components combined represent the changes in poverty \ndue to the shift in the nominal poverty lines.  \nAs with the previous cases, we need to make some assumptions about the path of change to \nimplement the decomposition in Proposition 4. Therefore, we simply assume that   ,  \u0302 , \n ,  \u0302     , and   change linearly. That is, we first estimate  \u0302  by kernel density estimation \n   \nand calculate   ,  ,  \u0302     , and   for all   at        and       . Then, we take the linear \n       \n14 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 466                                     Fujii \ninterpolation. In case of   , for example, we assume   ( )  (   )  (  )    (  ) for \n   \n    (    )\u2044(     ). We make a similar assumption for  ,  \u0302     , and   . Note that we are \n         \nunable to obtain simple closed-form results, because  \u0302 is multiplied with another time-varying \nvariable in the integration.  \n2.7  Some Implementation Issues \nTo implement the decomposition in Proposition 1 in its general form, we need to estimate  \u0303 in \na typical empirical setup. Therefore, the choice of kernel density function and bandwidth used \nin the estimation of  \u0303 affects the results. Following the standard choice in the literature, we \nuse the Epanechnikov kernel density function. Typically, the choice of the kernel density \nfunction is not particularly important.9  \nHowever, the choice of the bandwidth is important and can affect the decomposition results \nin a non-negligible manner. If we use a small bandwidth, the resulting poverty estimates are \ncloser  to  those  directly  calculated  from  the  observed  data.  However,  the  graph  of  the \nestimated density function is likely to be more spiky. On the other hand, if we use a large \nbandwidth, the estimate of  \u0303 is likely to become inaccurate.  \nThis issue is particularly important for the decomposition of   . If the bandwidth is too small, \n \n \u0303 takes a very high value near observed income levels and 0 for all other values. In this case, \nwe  cannot  estimate  \u0303 very  accurately,  which  makes  it  difficult  to  perform  the  numerical \nintegration required for decomposition.  \nGiven the considerations mentioned above, we set the half-width of kernel at         (i.e., \none percentage point in the relative income), which is small enough to reproduce the poverty \nstatistics that are very close to poverty statistics derived directly from the original sample but \nlarge enough to eliminate the spikes in the density estimate from our data. All the empirical \nresults presented in section 4 that rely on kernel density estimation are based on this choice \nof bandwidth.10  \nTo  implement  the  numerical  integration,  we  adopted  the  following  procedure.  First,  we \nestimate  \u0303(    ) and  \u0303(    ) on a set of fixed evaluation points {          }, where   is the \n         \nnumber of evaluation points,      , and      \u0303( ) for all    [     ]. Second, following the \n       \ninterpolation rule specified in the assumption (e.g., equation (7)), we derive  \u0303(   )  on each \nevaluation  point  at  time {          },  where       ,       ,  and   is  the  number  of \n             \nevaluation points for the outer integral in Proposition 1. Third, using the estimate of  \u0303(   ), we \nevaluate the inner integral using a numerical integration method. Once we obtain the inner \nintegral, we evaluate the outer integral in a similar manner.11 To obtain sufficiently accurate \nresults, we set                in our empirical application.12 \n                                                \n9\n Note here that we only need the kernel density estimates for the lower tail for our analysis. By focusing on the \nlower tail, we can reduce the memory usage. \n10\n In Appendix D, we present the results with 50% larger and smaller bandwidth to verify the robustness of our \nresults. \n11\n We implemented this with a quadratic interpolation, which is essentially Simpson\u2019s rule. We make some \nadjustments, because the upper end of the integral,  \u0303, varies over time and does not coincide with an \nevaluation point in general. Also, because   \u0303\u2044   diverges to infinity at      when     under the assumption \n \nof eq. (15), we use a linear approximation of the expression inside the square bracket in eq. (6) in this case to \ncalculate the integral over the first interval (i.e., [     ]). The details of this treatment are given in Appendix C. \n   \n12\n Comparison of the numerical integration results under linear assumption with the analytical results presented in \nSection 2.3 indicates that the margin of the error is at most 0.004 percentage points for two-way decomposition \nanalysis. For other results, we cannot directly evaluate the accuracy of our numerical results. However, the \ncomparison between the sum of each component in the decomposition analysis and the observed change \nprovides some guidance. According to this criterion, the six-way decomposition in Section 4 is slightly less \n \n15 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 466                                     Fujii \n3.  DATA AND POVERTY MEASUREMENT \nWe  use  the  public  user  files  for  the  following  nine  rounds  of  the  Family  Income  and \nExpenditure Survey (FIES): 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006, and 2009. The \nFIES was collected by the National Statistics Office (NSO). The FIES data include income, \nexpenditure, and various other household information. They are used for calculating official \npoverty statistics published by the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB). For the \nsix-way decomposition in Proposition 4, we also use the price data taken from the consumer \nprice index (CPI), also collected by the NSO. As noted earlier, we take each region as a \ngroup in the six-way decomposition, but the definition of regions in the Philippines has \nchanged over time. Thus, we choose to adopt the latest definition, which has 17 regions, and \nconstructed the region variable under this definition for earlier rounds of  FIES from the \nprovince variable in the data.  \nThe distribution of the logarithmic nominal annual income per capita in the Philippines is \npresented in Figure 3. The figure shows that the distribution in each FIES round after 1985 \nfirst-order stochastically dominates the previous round, implying that the nominal income has \nincreased for both the rich and the poor in the Philippines. However, this figure ignores the \ninflation and heterogeneity across regions, and thus does not provide a clear picture about \nthe sources of poverty change in the Philippines. Therefore, the poverty decomposition \nmethods developed in the previous section are useful.  \nFigure 3: Cumulative Distribution Function of the Logarithmic Income per Capita  \nper Year in Philippine Pesos \n \nSource: Author\u2019s calculation based on Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) data. \nTo implement the decomposition, we first need to set the poverty lines. A natural choice \nwould be the NSCB\u2019s official poverty lines, because the official poverty statistics are widely \nused by the government and are one of the most important statistics for the formulation of \npoverty reduction policies in the Philippines.  \nHowever, the official methodology for setting the poverty lines has been revised three times. \nAs clearly seen in Figure 4, the estimates based on different revisions of methodology are \n                                                                                                                                                   \naccurate. However, our estimates (in percentage points) are accurate at least up to the first decimal point and \nup to the second decimal point in most cases.

Moreover, no revision of the official methodology covers the \nentire nine rounds of FIES, making it difficult to understand the nature of the long-term \npoverty  changes  in  the  Philippines.  Furthermore,  even  when  the  same  revision  of \nmethodology is used, the comparability of official poverty statistics over time and across \nregions has been disputed (Balisacan 2003; Bernales 2009) and multiple versions of \u201cofficial\u201d \nestimates appear to exist for some years.  \nFigure 4: Comparison between Official Poverty Statistics and Our Poverty Statistics \n \nNote: The horizontal and vertical axis indicate the calendar year and the poverty rate in percentage, respectively.  \nSource:  Official  figures  are  compiled  from  Asian  Development  Bank  (2005)  and \nhttp://www.nscb.gov.ph/poverty/2009/table_2.asp. \nHence, we chose to adopt a modified version of the 2011 revision of the official methodology \nand produced our own back estimates. For the years in which official poverty estimates \nbased on the 2011 revision of the methodology are available, our poverty statistics are very \nsimilar to the official poverty statistics as shown in Figure 4. They also have a trend very \nsimilar to official poverty statistics for other years. Therefore, our poverty statistics capture \nwell the changes in the official poverty statistics over time. Further details on the data and \npoverty measurement for this study are provided in Appendix A. \n4.  RESULTS \nIn  this  section,  we  present  various  decomposition  results.  We  start  with  the  two-way \ndecomposition under the linear approximation discussed in section 2.3, the results of which \nare given in Table 1. While convenient analytical results under linear approximation are only \navailable for the poverty rate   , we have also carried out the decomposition for poverty gap \n \n  , poverty severity   , and the Watts measure   by numerical integration.13 The first two \n   \ncolumns in Table 1 provide the initial year    and the terminal year   . For each poverty \n   \n                                                \n13\n The decomposition result for P  reported in Table 1 is based on Proposition 2 and thus derived without kernel \n0\ndensity estimation. For all other decomposition results, kernel density estimation is used. In the case of two-\nway decomposition,  \u0303 is estimated for the Philippines. In the case of six-way decomposition,  \u0303  is estimated for \neach region of the Philippines. This leads to a small discrepancy in   across tables. \n17 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 466                                     Fujii \nmeasure, we report the initial level of poverty  (  ), the change   in the poverty measure \n \nbetween    and   , the growth component   , and the redistribution component   . For \n   \nexample, the growth component of the change in poverty gap between 1994 and 1997 is  \n-3.40 percentage points. The last row (all periods) is the sum of all the changes in the eight \n3-year periods. \nTable 1 shows that the poverty changes in the Philippines have been largely driven by the \ngrowth component. Notice here that the growth component in this analysis refers to the \nchange in poverty due to the relative poverty line, or the poverty line over the mean income. \nTherefore, the effect of inflation at the poverty line is already accounted for in the growth \ncomponent.  \nTable 1 also shows that the patterns of poverty change are similar across all the poverty \nmeasures considered here. Over the periods between 1985 and 2009, about 30% of the \npoverty  reduction  achieved  by  economic  growth  has  been  offset  by  worsened  income \ninequality, regardless of the poverty measure used. Most of the effects of worsening income \ninequality took place in the two periods 1988\u20131991 and 1994\u20131997.    \nOne concern about this analysis is that the results may be driven by our linearity assumption. \nTherefore, we have carried out a robustness check assuming  equations (7) and (15) as \ndescribed in section 2.5. Table 2 shows the decomposition results for the poverty rate using \nvarious values of   and a few other methods described in section 2. The third column,  , is \nthe  change  in  poverty  rate  between    and   .  The  fourth  column,    ,  is  the  growth \n      \ncomponent in the KS decomposition, which corresponds to      . The fifth column,     , \n     \u2044 \nis the growth component for      \u2044 . The results in the seventh column,    , are the same \n  \nas those presented in the fifth column of Table 1. The tenth column,    , is the growth \n  \ncomponent for the JT decompositions, which corresponds to      . As shown in the fifth to \ntenth columns of Table 2, the decomposition results are quite stable.  \nThe eleventh column,    , is the growth component in the Shapley decomposition. The \n \ntwelfth column,    , is the growth component under the log-linear approximation discussed in \n   \nSection 4. These decomposition results are also similar to the results presented in Table 1. \nThe last column,    , is the residual component in the DR decomposition, which turns out to \n  \nbe small. Thus, our decomposition results and the decomposition results based on the \nexisting  methods  are  generally  close  in  the  Philippines  for  the  time  periods  we  have \nconsidered. \nHowever, our finding does not imply that the choice of decomposition method does not \nmatter. To see how much the choice of method may matter, we carry out an experiment for \npoverty rate decomposition. We assume that the linearity assumption is satisfied piecewise \nfor  all  eight  3-year  periods  from  1985  to  2009  and  treat  the  decomposition  under  this \nassumption as the benchmark decomposition result. We then drop from the data some years \nin between and calculate the growth component of poverty change for each period in the \ndata (e.g., if years 1988, 1991, 1994, 2003, and 2006 are dropped from the data, there are \nthree periods: 1985\u20131997, 1997\u20132000, and 2000\u20132009) and add the growth component for \nthese periods to arrive at an estimate of the growth component for the entire period 1985\u2013\n2009. We do this for all the possible combinations for each number of observations dropped. \nWe then  calculate the maximum  and mean  absolute  deviation  of  the  estimated growth \ncomponent from the benchmark growth component. Note here that whether we use the \ngrowth  component  or  redistribution  component  makes  no  difference  in  the  two-way \ndecomposition because the change in poverty between 1985 and 2009 is fixed and thus the \nabsolute deviations are the same for growth and redistribution components.  \n18 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 466                                                  Fujii \nTable 1: Comparison of Two-Way Decomposition Results across Various Poverty Measures \n      Poverty rate (P )  Poverty gap (P )  Poverty severity (P )  Watts measure (W) \n0 1 2\n         (  )              (  )              (  )              (  )            \n           \n1985  1988  35.83  -3.07  -2.82  -0.25  11.13  -1.46  -1.12  -0.34  4.82  -0.85  -0.56  -0.29  15.08  -2.28  -1.61  -0.67 \n1988  1991  32.76  0.08  -3.15  3.23  9.66  0.24  -1.33  1.57  3.97  0.21  -0.66  0.87  12.80  0.48  -1.90  2.39 \n1991  1994  32.84  -4.21  -2.49  -1.72  9.90  -1.45  -1.01  -0.44  4.18  -0.66  -0.50  -0.16  13.28  -2.01  -1.44  -0.57 \n1994  1997  28.63  -2.68  -8.47  5.79  8.45  -0.84  -3.40  2.56  3.52  -0.39  -1.67  1.28  11.27  -1.19  -4.83  3.64 \n1997  2000  25.95  0.86  0.98  -0.12  7.61  0.22  0.39  -0.17  3.13  0.06  0.19  -0.13  10.08  0.26  0.55  -0.29 \n2000  2003  26.80  -2.52  -1.01  -1.51  7.83  -0.75  -0.39  -0.36  3.20  -0.28  -0.19  -0.09  10.34  -0.96  -0.55  -0.41 \n2003  2006  24.29  1.99  1.71  0.27  7.08  0.52  0.68  -0.16  2.91  0.14  0.33  -0.19  9.39  0.58  0.96  -0.38 \n2006  2009  26.27  0.09  1.07  -0.98  7.60  -0.34  0.42  -0.77  3.05  -0.23  0.20  -0.43  9.97  -0.55  0.59  -1.14 \nAll periods     -9.47  -14.17  4.70     -3.87  -5.75  1.88     -2.00  -2.86  0.87     -5.66  -8.23  2.57 \nNote: M(t0) is in percentage. \u0394, GR, and RD are all in percentage points. \nSource: Author\u2019s calculation based on Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) data. \nTable 2: Decomposition of Poverty Rate with Various Methods and Values of \u03b3 \n                                                                \n            \u2044       \u2044                            \n1985  1988  -3.07  -2.92  -2.91  -2.87  -2.82  -2.77  -2.73  -2.67  -2.80  -2.82  0.25 \n1988  1991  0.08  -3.19  -3.19  -3.16  -3.15  -3.14  -3.14  -3.12  -3.16  -3.15  0.06 \n1991  1994  -4.21  -2.49  -2.51  -2.49  -2.49  -2.49  -2.50  -2.50  -2.49  -2.49  -0.01 \n1994  1997  -2.68  -8.38  -8.48  -8.45  -8.47  -8.48  -8.48  -8.46  -8.42  -8.47  -0.08 \n1997  2000  0.85  0.95  0.97  0.97  0.98  0.99  0.99  1.00  0.97  0.98  0.05 \n2000  2003  -2.51  -1.03  -1.03  -1.02  -1.01  -1.00  -0.99  -0.98  -1.00  -1.00  0.05 \n2003  2006  1.98  1.76  1.75  1.73  1.71  1.70  1.69  1.68  1.72  1.71  -0.08 \n2006  2009  0.09  1.03  1.05  1.06  1.07  1.09  1.11  1.13  1.08  1.08  0.10 \nNote: All the figures for poverty decomposition are in percentage points. \nSource: Author\u2019s calculation based on Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) data. \n19 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 466                                    Fujii \nTable 3 shows the results of this experiment.

Because  there  is  only  one \ncombination in this case, the maximum and mean are identical. For example, Table 3 shows \nthat  the  growth  component  under  the  linearity  assumption  between  1985  and  2009  is \ndifferent  from  that  in  the  benchmark  case  of  piecewise  linearity  assumption  by  0.22 \npercentage  points.  In  the  second  row,  we  consider  the  case  in  which  we  drop  six \nobservations. Because we keep only one of the seven observations strictly between 1985 \nand 2009 in this case, there are seven possible combinations as shown in the second \ncolumn. The benchmark case corresponds to equation (10) with no observation dropped and \nhence the last row for the equation (10) column is 0 by construction.  \n We see that generally the last three columns perform better than the KS and JT columns. \nThis is not surprising because both the KS and JT decompositions rely on the assumption \nthat  growth  and  redistribution  change  sequentially.  While  the  Shapley  decomposition  is \nsimply the average of these two decompositions, it is close to the benchmark case because it \ncan  approximate  the  linear  assumption  reasonably  well,  as  argued  in  Section 2.3. \nEquation (10) is close to the benchmark by construction, because the assumed path of \nchange is the same as the benchmark case except for the periods that involve the dropped \nobservations. Equation (14) is also close to the benchmark, because the underlying path of \nchanges is similar to equation (10).

Unlike the KS, JK, and RD decompositions, we can neatly decompose the \npoverty change into population shift, within-group redistribution, between-group redistribution, \nnominal growth, inflation, and methodological change components for each group in the \npopulation of interest. While the Shapley decomposition also allows us to produce residual-\nfree decomposition results, it is computationally infeasible to carry out six-way decomposition \nwith regional disaggregation because the number of possible sequences of change is equal \nto the factorial of the number of components.  \nIn Table 4, we report the results of six-way decomposition of poverty rate described in \nsection 2.6. The last row is the sum of the eight 3-year periods and the last column, which \nrepresents the change in poverty rate, is equal to the sum of all six components. There are \nthree important points to note in this table.  \nFirst, Table 4 shows that the nominal growth has contributed to a more than 100-percentage-\npoint reduction in poverty rate between 1985 and 2009. This is possible because nominal \ngrowth can eliminate poverty created by other factors such as inflation. In fact, Table 4 shows \nthat much of the poverty reduction by nominal growth has been offset by inflation. If we \ndefine the effect of real growth as the combined effects of nominal growth and inflation \ncomponents, we see that the effect of real growth has contributed to the reduction of poverty \nby  more  than  20  percentage  points  between  1985  and  2009  in  the  Philippines.  This \noverwhelming effect of real growth would not be surprising given that countries with higher \ngrowth have tended to reduce poverty at a faster rate. It is also worth noting that much of the \nreal-growth effect has taken place before 1997 and real growth has not contributed to poverty \nreduction since then.  \nSecond,  Table 4  also  shows  that  poverty  has  increased  due  to  both  within-group \nredistribution and between-group redistribution effects, but the former effect is much larger \nthan the latter. It also shows that their relative importance has changed over time. For \nexample, the main driver of poverty increase due to worsening distribution was between-\nregion inequality for 1988\u20131991, but it was within-region inequality for 1994\u20131997. We also \nsee  from  Table 4  that  the  between-region  inequality  has  changed  favorably  for  poverty \nreduction since 2000. We also see that the population shift did not have much impact on the \nnational poverty rate in the Philippines.   \nThird, the methodological change component is not negligible. Poverty has increased by as \nmuch as 8 percentage points due to this component. The interpretation of the methodological \n21 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 466                                    Fujii \ncomponent is slightly tricky. The methodological  component reflects the changes in the \nquantity of goods at the level of the poverty line. Therefore, if the standards of living at the \npoverty line go up over time (e.g., because of the inconsistency in the way poverty lines are \ndrawn), poverty goes up even when there is no change in the mean and distribution of \nincome in the Philippines. Hence, it is possible that the methodological change component \nreflects a spurious change due to methodological inconsistency. It is also possible, however, \nthat the poor have systematically increased consumption of goods that are getting expensive.    \nThe latter possibility, however, is unlikely to be true in the Philippines because the poor \ntypically tend to shift away from goods that are getting rapidly expensive (Fujii 2013). The \ncomparison of the changes in consumption poverty (   ) calculated by Professor Balisacan \n \n(see Balisacan [2003] and ADB [2009]) against the \u201craw\u201d change in poverty rate (   ) and \n \nthe  one  adjusted  for  the  methodological  change  (         )  also  suggest  that  the \n      \nmethodological change component is indeed spurious. As seen in Figure 5, the changes in \nour poverty measure with the adjustment for the methodological component (dashed line) are \ncloser to the changes in Balisacan\u2019s consumption poverty rate (bold line) than those without \nthe adjustment (solid line). Because Balisacan uses consumption poverty lines that are \nsupposed to be comparable over time, our results indicate that the slow progress in poverty \nreduction in our poverty measure is partly because of the increases in the standards of living \nat the poverty line. Therefore, actual poverty reduction may have been faster than what \nFigure 4 suggests, once we fix the standards of living at the poverty line.  \nFigure 5: Comparison with Balisacan\u2019s Estimate of Consumption Poverty \n \nSources: Author\u2019s calculation based on Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) data; Balisacan (2003); ADB \n(2009). \nAs  discussed  in  section 2.6,  it  is  possible  to  decompose  the  poverty  change  into  six \ncomponents for each region so that we can pin down the important sources of poverty \nchange. Table 5 shows the regional decomposition results for poverty rate for 1985\u20132009, \nwhich are calculated as the sum of the decomposition results for the eight 3-year periods. By \nconstruction, the last row is the same as that in Table 4. The last column of Table 5 is the \nsum of all six components, which can be interpreted as each region\u2019s contribution to the \nchange in the national poverty rate. Therefore, most regions have made some contribution to \nthe  national  poverty  reduction,  with  Region VI  and  Region VII  making  particularly  large \ncontributions.14 However, some other regions, such as ARMM, have negated some of these \n                                                \n14\n See Table A1 in the Appendix for a description of the regions. \n22 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 466                                    Fujii \nreductions. This observation is still true when we adjust for the MC component. It should also \nbe noted that everything else being equal, each component tends to be larger in absolute \nvalue when the region is large. However, our results are not driven by the size of the regions, \nbecause Region VI, Region VII, and ARMM are not particularly large regions.  \nTable 5  also  shows  that  there  is  substantial  heterogeneity  in  the  way  each  region  has \ncontributed to poverty change in the Philippines. Although nominal growth and inflation are \nthe largest components in absolute value, the impact of real growth (NG+IF) on national \npoverty varies quite substantially, ranging from -2.58 in Region VI to -0.07 in ARMM. The \nmagnitude of within-group and between-group inequality also varies over regions. We find \nthat the within-group redistribution component has contributed to an increase in the poverty \nrate in most regions, whereas the impact of the between-group redistribution component is \nquite diverse. While we only discussed the six-way decomposition results for the poverty \nrate, the results for the poverty gap, poverty severity, and Watts measure, which are reported \nin Appendix D, are qualitatively similar.  \nTable 5: Six-Way Decomposition of P  by Region \n0\nRegion  PS  WR  BR  NG  IF  MC      \n \nNCR  -0.06  -0.02  -0.53  -6.15  5.21  0.37  -1.17 \nCAR  -0.06  0.21  0.14  -1.75  1.32  0.20  0.05 \nRegion I  -0.19  0.22  0.29  -6.93  5.23  0.84  -0.55 \nRegion II  -0.17  0.36  -0.04  -4.85  3.73  0.32  -0.66 \nRegion III  0.17  -0.27  0.66  -9.98  7.69  1.20  -0.53 \nRegion IV-A  0.50  0.40  -0.42  -8.84  7.06  0.66  -0.64 \nRegion IV-B  0.12  -0.12  0.23  -3.46  2.59  0.60  -0.04 \nRegion V  -0.27  0.68  -0.18  -9.01  7.22  0.45  -1.12 \nRegion VI  -0.14  0.32  -0.22  -10.82  8.23  0.64  -1.98 \nRegion VII  0.16  0.22  -0.76  -8.31  6.79  0.19  -1.71 \nRegion VIII  -0.22  0.89  -0.68  -6.53  5.12  0.53  -0.89 \nRegion IX  -0.07  0.24  0.28  -4.03  3.09  0.23  -0.26 \nRegion X  -0.10  0.26  0.22  -5.15  3.94  0.45  -0.39 \nRegion XI  -0.07  0.29  0.25  -5.62  4.17  0.61  -0.36 \nRegion XII  0.30  0.58  0.07  -4.73  3.23  0.79  0.23 \nARMM  -0.09  -0.34  1.33  -5.27  5.20  -0.27  0.57 \nCaraga  -0.11  0.53  0.05  -3.66  2.92  0.24  -0.03 \nPhilippines  -0.28  4.46  0.67  -105.09  82.73  8.05  -9.45 \n \nNote: All the figures for poverty decomposition are expressed in percentage points. \nSource: Author\u2019s calculation based on Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) data. \n5.  DISCUSSION \nIn  this  paper,  we  have  proposed  a  method  of  dynamic  poverty  decomposition  that  is \nsubperiod-additive and time-reversion consistent. Our decomposition analysis consistently \nintegrates the conventional dynamic poverty decomposition such as Datt and Ravallion (1992) \nand group-based decomposition such as Ravallion and Huppi (1991). Our method has an \nadditional advantage in that there are no residual or interaction terms. While our method \nrequires  the  specification  of  the  path  of  change,  we  have  provided  a  practical  way  to \nimplement the decomposition under a set of reasonable assumptions.  \n23 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 466                                    Fujii \nIn our empirical application to the Philippines, we considered a six-way decomposition in \nwhich  the  national  poverty  change  is  decomposed  into  population  shift,  within-group \nredistribution, between-group redistribution, nominal growth, inflation, and methodological \nchange components for each of the 17 regions in the Philippines.  \nWe find that nominal growth and inflation are by far the largest components in absolute value \nin each region and that the impacts of other components are heterogeneous, which indicates \nthat the appropriate poverty reduction policies may vary from region to region. For example, \nthe results reported in Table 5 suggest that some regions, such as ARMM, would require \ngrowth-enhancing policies to reduce poverty effectively, whereas other regions, such as \nRegion VIII, may need policies to improve the income distribution within the region. We also \nfind that poverty reduction in the Philippines has been slowed substantially by worsening \ninequality for the periods 1988\u20131991 and 1994\u20131997. For other periods, the apparent slow \nprogress in poverty reduction was mostly because of the lack of real economic growth but \nalso partly because of the methodological change.    \nIn this study, we chose regions as a unit of the group for empirical illustration, because the \nPhilippines is spatially heterogeneous in terms of consumption patterns, growth rate, and \ninflation rate. However, our analysis can also be applied to a number of other issues by using \nother variables as a unit of group, such as the ethnic groups, the education of household \nhead, the employment status or sector of the household head, and the household size. Using \nthese variables, we can expand the scope of the standard poverty profile approach. That is, \ninstead of simply comparing the poverty rate, poverty gap, and poverty severity across \ndifferent groups for various years, as is done in the standard poverty profile approach, using \nour method, we can decompose the change in national poverty into various components for \neach  group  in  the  population.  Hence,  our  decomposition  method  can  complement  and \nenhance the usefulness of the poverty profile approach.    \nWhile we chose to apply our method to a developing country, it is also applicable to poverty \nanalysis in developed countries, where poverty lines are typically drawn separately for each \nhousehold category and defined as a fraction of mean or median income. Therefore, even if \neveryone\u2019s income is rising, poverty may still increase if the income at the center of the \ndistribution rises faster than incomes in the lower tail of the distribution. Using our method \n(with a slight modification), it is possible to separate the effects of increasing income at the \nbottom and middle on poverty.    \nIt should also be noted that our method does not necessarily require all the components of \ninterest  to  independently  vary  over  time.  For  example,  if  inequality  determines  growth \nthrough the process of human and physical capital accumulation (e.g., Galor and Moav 2004) \nwhile     is  held  constant,  we  would  have  the  following  relationship  instead  of,  say, \nequation (8)  in  Assumption 8:   \u0303( )\u2044      ( \u0303( \u0303  )) for  some  function  ( ) with  its  definite \nintegral from       to        being  \u0303   \u0303 . In a case like this, poverty change is completely \n        \ndetermined by the change in income distribution. However, it is still possible to identify the \ngrowth and redistribution components in our approach, because Proposition 1 still holds and \nthus the growth component can be computed by simply replacing   \u0303( )\u2044   by  ( \u0303( \u0303  )) in \nequation (6). Similarly, it is also possible to consider the effects of demographic dividend by \nexplicitly modeling the relationship between demographic characteristics of the population \nand economic growth.  \nAs with other decomposition methods, our decomposition is descriptive and essentially an \naccounting  exercise.  Therefore,  it  does  not  in  general  describe  the  causal  relationship \nbetween poverty and the components of interest. However, the discussion in the preceding \nparagraph  means  that  we  can  potentially  make  a  causal  inference  if  the  underlying \nrelationship between components is known.15 Even when no such relationship is known, our \n                                                \n15 Note, though, that we are still agnostic about the driving force of the change in  \u0303( \u0303  ). \n24 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 466                                    Fujii \ndecomposition still provides researchers and policy makers with information that is useful for \n \nunderstanding the source of poverty change and formulating poverty reduction policies.\n   \n25 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 466                                    Fujii \nREFERENCES \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). 2005.

Details of Data and Poverty Measurement \nIn the official methodology, the poverty lines are set at the level where one can satisfy some \nbasic nutritional requirements and meet some non-food needs. The methodology to calculate \nthe poverty line, however, has been revised three times: in 1992, 2003, and 2011.1 The \nofficial poverty statistics based on the 1992 and 2003 revisions are available for 1985\u20132000 \nand 2000\u20132006, respectively. Those based on the 2011 revision are currently available for \n1991, 2003, 2006, and 2009.  \nWe adopt the 2011 revision with some modifications. Because poverty lines based on the \n1992 revision are available only at the regional level, we use the regional (and not provincial) \npoverty line for all years. Further, we recalculate the aggregate income for all rounds of the \nFamily Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) because there was a minor inconsistency in \nthe definition of incomes. As a result, the poverty statistics used in our study are not exactly \nthe same as the official statistics. However, these modifications have little impact on the \nresulting poverty statistics.  \nTo obtain the poverty lines for earlier years, we first calculate the rate of change in poverty \nline between two contiguous survey rounds for each region. When more than one rate is \navailable for a given period, we use the harmonic mean for that period. Because some \nregions did not exist in earlier years, we instead use the rate for the island group to which the \nregion belongs. Using these rules, we extrapolate poverty lines for earlier years, which are \npresented in Table A1.  \nTo carry out the six-way decomposition, we need to define the set of goods used in the \ncalculation of poverty lines. Based on the availability of data, we set J = 10 and use the \nfollowing 10 goods: (i) food, (ii) alcohol and tobacco, (iii) clothing and footwear, (iv) housing \nand  utility,  (v) furniture,  household  equipment,  and  operation,  (vi) medical  care, \n(vii) transportation and communication, (viii) recreation, (ix) education, and (x) miscellaneous \ngoods and services. The consumption expenditure data in FIES are aggregated up to these \n10 goods. The consumer price index (CPI) data are also aggregated up to this level using the \nCPI weights.  \nFor all the years except 2009, the reference year for the CPI data is year 2000. Because we \ncould only obtain base-2006 CPI data for 2009, we simply multiply base-2000 CPI figures for \n2006 by base-2006 CPI figures for 2009 to obtain an estimate of base-2000 CPI figures for \n2009. For years before 1988, the CPI has only six types of goods. For example, we have the \nCPI data for \u201cfood, alcohol, and tobacco,\u201d without the breakdown for \u201cfood\u201d and \u201calcohol and \ntobacco.\u201d Therefore, we assume that the CPI change is the same for these two categories. \nWe apply a similar rule for other aggregate categories, too.  \n \nThe price    of good   in region   is taken from the annual average CPI for good   in region \n \n . Because the bundles of goods underlying the poverty lines are not available, we first take \nthe average expenditure share for those households within 10% of the poverty line in region \n \n  for each survey year. Then, multiplying it by the poverty line and dividing it by   , we obtain \n \n \nthe quantity    of good   in region   at the poverty line for each survey year.  \n \n \n \n                                                \n1\n See Asian Development Bank (2005) and National Statistical Coordination Board (2011) for the details of these \nchanges. \n28 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 466                                    Fujii \n \nTable A1: Income Poverty Lines in the Philippines Used for This Study \nRegion  Description of Region  1985  1988  1991  1994  1997  2000  2003  2006  2009 \nNCR  National Capital Region  3,360  4,881  6,892  8,335 10,613 12,873 13,704 16,487 19,802 \nCAR  Cordillera Administrative Region  2,669  3,456  5,629  7,333  8,672 10,356 10,841 12,976 16,122 \nRegion I  Ilocos Region  2,999  3,920  6,404  7,962  9,514 11,536 11,835 14,350 17,768 \nRegion II  Cagayan Valley  2,765  3,667  5,641  6,668  7,922  9,809 10,250 12,212 15,306 \nRegion III  Central Luzon  3,126  4,207  6,559  7,830  9,501 11,846 12,756 15,374 18,981 \nRegion IV-A  CALARARZON  3,002  3,823  6,389  7,546  9,852 11,798 12,180 14,284 17,779 \nRegion IV-B  MIMAROPA  2,431  3,096  5,174  6,110  7,978  9,554 10,397 12,610 15,769 \nRegion V  Bicol Region  2,928  3,533  5,444  7,093  8,849 10,640 11,559 13,645 17,146 \nRegion VI  Western Visayas  2,876  3,399  5,010  6,414  8,263  9,653  9,799 12,432 16,036 \nRegion VII  Central Visayas  3,061  3,437  5,172  5,950  8,073 10,133 11,488 14,468 17,848 \nRegion VIII  Eastern Visayas  2,650  3,081  4,147  5,201  7,043  8,420  9,600 11,885 15,910 \nRegion IX  Zamboanga Peninsula  2,774  2,988  5,003  5,573  7,667  8,736  9,647 11,810 15,160 \nRegion X  Northern Mindanao  2,770  3,533  5,026  6,201  8,156  9,197 10,200 12,987 16,568 \nRegion XI  Davao Region  2,965  3,966  5,322  6,670  8,542  9,907 10,731 13,469 17,040 \nRegion XII  SOCCSKSARGEN  2,850  3,218  5,681  6,961  8,628  9,657 10,368 12,530 15,762 \nCaraga  Caraga Region  2,938  3,585  5,468  6,637  8,595 10,039 10,478 12,935 16,858 \nAutonomous Region in Muslim \nARMM  Mindanao  2,566  3,130  4,775  5,697  7,136  8,810  9,693 12,358 16,334 \nNote: Poverty lines are expressed as the annual household income per capita in Philippine pesos.  \nSource: Author\u2019s calculation based on poverty lines published in National Statistics Office (NSO) webpages and \npublications. \nB. Proofs of Propositions \nProof  of  Proposition 1: Note first that  \u2044     \u0303\u2044 \u0303 holds.

It  is  clear  from  equation (B1)  that \n(  {   (     )} ) is  a  poverty  decomposition.  The  time-reversion  consistency  and \n         \nsubperiod additivity follow immediately from the basic properties of integrals.   \nProof of Proposition 2: By setting       and using integration by parts in equation (2), we \nhave:  \nz\n  P(F(\uf0d7)\uf02cz) \uf03d z\uf02d1\uf0f2 F(y)dy\uf02e                          (B2) \n1\n0\n \n29 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 466                                    Fujii \n \nLet us write the probability density function for  \u0303  by  \u0303 . Then, noting that we have  ( )    \n   \nfor the poverty rate measure and substituting equations (7) and (8) in equation (5), we have:  \n\uf044RDM(t \uf02ct ) \uf03d \uf0f2t1 \uf0e9\uf0ea\uf0f2z f(y\uf02ct1)\uf02d f(y\uf02ct0)dy\uf0f9\uf0fadt \uf03d \uf0f2z1\uf0e9\uf0eaF(z\uf02ct1)\uf02dF(z\uf02ct0)\uf0f9\uf0fadz \nl\uf02a 0 1 t0 \uf0eb 0 t1 \uf02dt0 \uf0fb z0 \uf0eb z1\uf02dz0 \uf0fb\nz P(F \uf02cz )\uf02dz P(F \uf02cz )\uf02dz P(F \uf02cz )\uf02b z P(F \uf02cz )\n                       \uf03d 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 \uf02c          (B3) \nz \uf02dz\n1 0\nwhere the second and third lines follow from the change of variables and equation (B2), \nrespectively. The result for     (     ) follows immediately from this.   \n      \nProof  of  Proposition 3: The  proof  is  similar  to  that  of  Proposition 2.

Technical Appendix for Footnote 11 \nIn this section, we describe the implementation of numerical integration for       discussed \nin Footnote 11. To simplify the presentation, we denote the expression in the square bracket \nin equation (6) by  ( ). We approximate this by  ( )          for         , where      (  ) \n       \n     \n (  ) and      (  ).

Additional Tables \nTable D1 provides various types of errors discussed in Footnote 12. In the third column, \n (   ), we take the absolute difference between the direct calculation of equation (9) and its \n \ncounterpart obtained by numerical integration using equation (5). The fourth column gives the \nabsolute difference between the observed change in    and the sum of redistribution and \n \ngrowth  components  obtained  from  numerical  integration.  The  fifth,  sixth,  and  seventh \ncolumns are the corresponding differences for   ,   , and  , respectively. The last four \n   \ncolumns are the absolute difference between the observed change and the sum of six \ncomponents obtained by numerical integration for various poverty measures.  \nTable D2 shows the effect of bandwidth on the poverty measures and decomposition results, \nwhere \u201cDirect\u201d refers to the direct calculation that does not rely on kernel density estimation. \nWe see that the poverty estimates with our benchmark bandwidth of          are similar to \nthe direct calculation results.  \nTables D3, D4, and D5 are the same as Table 4, except that we use   ,   , and   instead of \n   \n   as the poverty measure.
