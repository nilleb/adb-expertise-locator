With  broader  recognition  of  their \nimportance,  the  availability  of  poverty  statistics  has  significantly  improved  over  the  last  4 \ndecades. The World Bank\u2019s Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) website alone lists \n38 countries with household surveys,1 and many other countries not in the list also routinely \nconduct surveys and publish national poverty statistics without much external assistance.  \n\nThe quality of poverty statistics has also improved with the accumulation of knowledge and \nexperience. Better survey designs have helped make the measurement of standards of living \nmore  accurate  and  more  readily  comparable  across  regions,  within  a  country,  and  over \nyears. As a result, we have a better understanding of the profile of the poor and its transition \nover time.  \n\nHowever,  in  the  standard  poverty  profile  approach,  it  is  often  unclear  what  has  caused  the \nobserved change in poverty. Adding to this problem, the methodology used to derive national \npoverty  statistics  is  not  always  uniform,  making  the  poverty  statistics  incomparable  across \nregions  or  over  time.  To  address  these  issues,  we  offer  a  new  methodology  of  poverty \ndecomposition in this paper.2  \n\nOur  method  is  highly  flexible  and  allows  us  to  decompose  the  poverty  change  into  several \ncomponents (e.g., growth and redistribution components) for each region or each sector in a \ncountry  in  a  coherent  manner.  Such  decomposition  is  useful  for  choosing  the  appropriate \npolicies  to  fight  poverty.  For  example,  in  regions  where  economic  growth  is  pro-poor  but \nslow,  policies  to  enhance  regional  economic  growth  (e.g.,  investment  in  infrastructure)  may \nbe an appropriate poverty reduction policy. On the other hand, in regions with high but anti-\npoor  economic  growth,  distribution-improving  policies  (e.g.,  cash  transfers)  may  be  more \nappropriate.  Our  method  is  easy  to  implement,  especially  when  a  set  of  simplifying  (but \nreasonable) assumptions are made. Our method produces a neat decomposition result that \ndoes  not  have  an  interaction  term  or  residual,  which  is  difficult  to  interpret.  Further,  as \ndiscussed in section 2, it satisfies two desirable properties of time-reversion consistency and \nsubperiod additivity unlike the existing decomposition methods.  \n\nWe  apply  our  method  to  the  Philippines  for  three  reasons.  First,  the  poverty  reduction \nprocess  in  the  Philippines  has  been  slower  than  that  of  most  other  countries  in  Southeast \nAsia. It is therefore useful to identify the sources of slow progress in the Philippines. To this \nend,  we  decompose  the  poverty  change  in  each  region  in  the  Philippines  into  six \ncomponents:  population  shift  (PS),  within-region  redistribution  (WR),  between-region \nredistribution (BR), nominal growth (NG), inflation (IF), and methodological change (MC). Our \ndecomposition shows that most of the poverty reduction achieved by nominal growth is offset \nby  inflation  and  worsening  distribution  within  each  region  when  we  look  at  overall  poverty \nchange  in  the  Philippines.  Our  regional  disaggregation  results  show  that  the  sources  of \npoverty  change  are  heterogeneous  across  regions  and  thus  the  suitable  poverty  reduction \npolicies  also  vary  across  regions.  For  example,  we  find  that  growth-enhancing  policies  are \ndesirable  for  poverty  reduction  in  the  Autonomous  Region  in  Muslim  Mindanao  (ARMM), \nwhereas distribution-improving policies are also important in Region VIII (Eastern Visayas).  \n\nSecond, the official poverty statistics in the Philippines are calculated with poverty lines that \nare specific to a region or a province. Therefore, the changes in the national statistics reflect \n\n                                                \n1\n See http://go.worldbank.org/PDHZFQZ6L0 (accessed 1 October 2013). \n2 Here,  we  are  concerned  with  the  case  where  the  reference  standards  of  living  at  the  poverty  line  are  not \ncomparable  across  time.  However,  incomparability  can  occur  for  other  reasons,  such  as  the  variations  in \nsurvey design over time. See, for example, Lanjouw and Lanjouw (2001). Deaton and Kozel (2005) provide an \noverview of the related debate in India. \n\n \n\n3 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 466  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n       \n\n \n\n \n\n   Fujii \n\nnot only the real changes in poverty but also the superficial changes due to the way official \npoverty  lines  are  adjusted  over  time.  By  applying  our  method  to  the  Philippines,  we  can \nseparate the superficial changes from the observed changes. We find that the slow progress \nin the reduction of official poverty in the Philippines is partly driven by the superficial changes \ndue to the change in methodology.  \n\nFinally, the Philippines has collected household income data once every 3 years since 1985. \nThis allows us to see the poverty change over a relatively long period of time. Therefore, it is \npossible  to  see  whether  the  driving  force  of  poverty  change  has  altered  over  time. We find \nthat  worsening  distribution  severely  crippled  the  progress  in  poverty  reduction  in  the  two \nperiods  1988\u20131991  and  1994\u20131997.  In  other  years,  the  slow  progress  in  poverty  reduction \nwas mainly explained by the lack of high real economic growth.  \n\nThis  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In  the  next  section,  we  briefly  review  existing \nmethodologies  of  poverty  decomposition  and  develop  a  new  method  of  dynamic  poverty \ndecomposition. In section 3, we describe the data and discuss some measurement issues. In \nsection 4, we present the decomposition results in the Philippines. Section 5 provides some \ndiscussion.  \n\n2.  METHODOLOGY \n\nIn this section, we develop a new method of dynamic poverty decomposition. To highlight the \nnovelty of our method, we first introduce the notations and review the existing methods. We \nthen present our general decomposition method. This method requires that we know the path \nof  the  changes  in  the  components  of  interest  (e.g.,  mean  and  distribution  of  income). \nHowever, this requirement is typically not fulfilled in a practical application. Therefore, we will \nconsider two sets of assumptions that allow us to implement the method in a straightforward \nmanner.  \n\nIn  section 2.3,  we  consider  a  simple  linear  approximation,  in  which  the  relative  poverty  line \n(poverty  line  relative  to  the  mean  income)  and  the  cumulative  distribution  function  of  the \nrelative  income  (individual  income  relative  to  the  mean  income)  change  linearly.  This \nassumption  leads  to  a  very  simple  expression  when  the  poverty  measure  of  interest  is  the \npoverty rate.  \n\nIn  section 2.4,  we  consider  a  log-linear  approximation  as  an  alternative  to  the  simple  linear \napproximation.  We  use  a  linear  approximation  for  the  logarithmic  relative  poverty  line  and \ndistribution of the logarithmic relative income. This approach also has some attractions as it \nhas  some  connections  with  pro-poor  growth  literature.  With  either  the  linear  or  log-linear \nassumption, the poverty decomposition can be implemented easily. We then vary the speed \nof  change  in  the  mean  income  relative  to  that  of  the  income  distribution  to  check  the \nrobustness of the linear approximation.  \n\nIn  section 2.6,  we  consider  an  extension  of  the  method  with  six  components.  Each \ncomponent can be further divided by groups such as regions or sectors. This extension helps \nresearchers  and  policy  makers  decide  what  poverty  reduction  policies are suitable for each \ngroup. Finally, we discuss some implementation issues. \n\n2.1  Notations and Existing Methods \n\nWe assume that the individual-level poverty measure is determined by the individual income \nand poverty line. The nominal income per capita   has a positive infimum,3 which is denoted \nby   ,  and  the  income  distribution  at  time   for  the  population  of  interest  is  given  by  the \n                                                \n3\n For most of our  discussion, we  only  require  that the  nominal  income is  non-negative.  Positive  infimum  is  only \n\nnecessary in section 2.4. \n\n \n\n4 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 466  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n       \n\n \n\n \n\n   Fujii \n\nprobability  density  function   (    ) .  The  corresponding  cumulative  distribution  function  is \ndenoted  by  (    ),  which  satisfies  (    )     for  all   because  of  the  positive  infimum.  The \npoverty  line  at  time  ,  or  the  threshold  income  level  below  which  the  individual  is  deemed \npoor, is denoted by  ( )(   ).  \n\nWith some slight abuse of notation, we consider a class of poverty measures   that has the \nfollowing form:  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(1) \n\nwhere the function  ( ) represents the individual-level poverty measure, which we assume is \ndifferentiable  at  any  point  on  the  unit  interval  except  for  0.  The  class  of  poverty  measures \ndefined  in  equation  (1)  is  additively  decomposable.  That  is,  the  poverty  measure  for  any \ngroup  can  be  expressed  as  the  mean  of  subgroup  poverty  measures  weighted  by  the \nsubgroups\u2019  population  shares.  This  is  a  useful  property  for  poverty  analysis,  because  it \nallows  us \nto  poverty.  Further,  additive \ndecomposability is not a restrictive requirement, because any poverty measure that satisfies \nthe  subgroup consistency\u2014a  property  that  requires  the  group  poverty  measure  to  increase \nwhenever  the  poverty  measure for  any  of  its  subgroups increases\u2014can be  expressed as a \nmonotonic  transformation  of  an  additively  decomposable  measure  (Foster  and  Shorrocks \n1991).  \n\nthe  major  contributing  groups \n\nidentify \n\nto \n\nThe Foster\u2013Greer\u2013Thorbecke (FGT) measure (Foster, Greer, and Thorbecke 1984), which is \nthe  most  popular  measure in the recent  poverty  literature,  is  a special  case  of  equation  (1) \nwith  ( \u0303)   (     \u0303) , where  \u0303      \u2044  is the income normalized by the poverty line and  (   ) \nis a parameter. The Watts measure (Watts 1968) is also a special case of equation (1) with  \n ( \u0303)       \u0303. While the Watts measure is not as widely used in applied research as the FGT \nmeasure, it follows from a set of reasonable axioms (Zheng 1993; Tsui 1996) and is closely \nrelated  to  our  decomposition  analysis  as  shown  in  section 2.4.  The  Chakravarty  measure \n(Chakravarty 1983) can also be obtained as a special case of equation (1) by letting  ( \u0303)  \n     \u0303  , where   is a parameter. \n\nBecause     is  independent  of     in  equation (1),  a  number  of  other  poverty  indices  are \nexcluded  from  consideration,  including  those  proposed  by  Sen  (1976),  Kakwani  (1980), \nTakayama (1979), and Clark, Hemming, and Ulph (1981). While it is possible to modify our \nanalysis  to  let   depend  on \n,  we  maintain  the  independence  for  the  sake  of  simplicity  of \npresentation. \nIn what follows, we focus on the FGT and Watts measures, which are denoted by    \nwith the following definitions, respectively:  \n\nand   \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(2) \n\n(3) \n\nWe shall refer to the FGT measure with parameter  0, 1, and 2 as poverty rate (  ), poverty \ngap (  ), and poverty severity (  ), respectively.  \nTo  conduct  poverty  decomposition,  it  is  useful  to  introduce  a  few  additional  notations.  We \n \ndenote the mean income at time   by  ( )   \u222b   (    )  \n, the relative income by  \u0303      ( ) \n \n \nand  the  relative  poverty  line  by   \u0303      ( )\n.  Here,  the  tilde  notations  (  \u0303) are  used  to \nemphasize  that  the  quantity  is  relative  to  the  population  mean.  The  probability  density \nfunction  of  the  relative  income  is  \u0303( \u0303   ),  which  satisfies  \u0303( \u0303   )    ( ) (    ) for  all   and  , \nand  the  corresponding  cumulative  distribution  function  is  \u0303 .  It  is  straightforward  to  show \n ( (    )   ( ))    ( \u0303(    )   \u0303( )).  \n\n\u2044\n\n\u2044\n\n5 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n()0()(()())(())()dztMtMFtztgyztfyty\uf0ba\uf0d7\uf02c\uf02c\uf0ba\uf02f\uf02c\uf02c\uf0f2F0()1dzyPFzFz\uf061\uf061\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf02c\uf0ba\uf02d\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0e8\uf0f8\uf0f20()lndzzWFzFy\uf02c\uf0ba\uf02e\uf0f2\fADBI Working Paper 466  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n       \n\n \n\n \n\n   Fujii \n\nThe purpose of poverty decomposition is to attribute the actual poverty change   (      )  \n (  )    (  ) to  the  components  of  interest,  such  as  the  growth  and  redistribution \ncomponents. Formally, we define poverty decomposition as follows:  \n\n be  the  index set  for  the  components  of  interest  and     be the \nDefinition  1.  Let \ncontribution of component  (   ) to the poverty change. The pair (   {   (      )}   )  \nis called a poverty decomposition for the poverty change between        and        \nwhen   (      )   \u2211    (      )\n\n.  \n\n \n\nOne  of  the  most  popular  decomposition  methods  was  proposed  by  Datt  and  Ravallion \n(1992), which has been used in a number of studies, including Ravallion and Huppi (1991), \nGrootaert (1995), and Sahn and Stifel (2000). The Datt\u2013Ravallion (DR) decomposition uses \nthe initial time point    as the reference time point. In their study, the poverty line,  , is fixed. \nTherefore,  the  change  in  the  relative  poverty  line,\n,  is  driven  only  by  the  change  in  mean \nincome (i.e., growth).  By fixing  either  the  relative  poverty  line  or  relative income  distribution \nand  letting  the  other  change,  we  can  decompose  the  poverty  change  into  the  growth \n   in the following manner with the notations \ncomponent    \nintroduced above:4  \n\n   and redistribution component    \n\n \n\n,\n\nwhere  \u0303 ( )    \u0303(     ) and  \u0303(  )    \u0303   for    {    } are  the  (relative)  income  distribution  and \npoverty line at time   , respectively.  \n\n    captures  the  poverty  change  not  explained  by  the  growth  and \nThe  residual  term     \nredistribution  components.  It  captures  the  interaction  between  growth  and  redistribution \ncomponents  and  can  be  interpreted  as  the  difference  between  the  growth  [redistribution] \ncomponents  evaluated  under  the  terminal  and  initial  relative  income  distributions  [mean \nincomes] (Datt and Ravallion 1992).  \n\nWhile setting the reference time point at the initial point is a natural choice, the presence of \nthe  residual  term  undermines  the  usefulness  of  the  decomposition  analysis.  This  is \nparticularly  true  when  the  residual  term  is  large  in  absolute  value.  As  Baye  (2006)  argues, \nknowledge  of  how  much  of  observed  changes  in  poverty  are  due  to  changes  in  the \nredistribution as distinguished from growth in average incomes is critical for public policy and \ndebate. Thus, if most of the poverty change is inexplicable, the decomposition results do not \ngive much useful information to the policy makers.  \n\nWe can easily avoid this problem if we are willing to assume that the change in mean income \nand distribution occurs in a certain sequence. In this case, we attribute the residual term to \neither the growth or redistribution component in effect. For example, Kakwani and Subbarao \n(1990) implicitly assume that the growth takes place first and the redistribution second, and \n    is  attributed  to  the  redistribution  component  in  their  decomposition.  On  the  other \nthus    \nhand,  Jain  and  Tendulkar  (1990)  consider  a  decomposition  in  which  redistribution  takes \nplace  first  and  growth  second.  Formally,  the  Kakwani\u2013Subbarao  (KS)  and  Jain\u2013Tendulkar \n(JT) decompositions are defined as follows:  \n\n                                                \n4\n Datt  and  Ravallion  (1992)  use  a  discrete  time  model.  On  the  other  hand,  our  presentation  is  based  on  a \ncontinuous  time model.  However,  this  distinction makes no essential difference.  The  same  remark  applies to \nother decomposition methods discussed in this subsection. \n\n \n\n6 \n\nCz10000100100101010101()()()()()()()()()()GRDRRDDRRSGRRDDRDRDRMttMMzzFFMttMMzzFFMttMttMttMtt\uf044\uf02c\uf03d\uf02c\uf02d\uf02c\uf044\uf02c\uf03d\uf02c\uf02d\uf02c\uf044\uf02c\uf03d\uf044\uf02c\uf02d\uf044\uf02c\uf02d\uf044\uf02c\uf02c\fADBI Working Paper 466  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n       \n\n \n\n \n\n   Fujii \n\n \n\nHowever,  the  KS  and  JT  decompositions  are  also  unsatisfactory  because  the  assumptions \nabout the sequence of change are arbitrary. Furthermore, neither the DR, the KS, nor the JT \ndecomposition satisfies the time-reversion consistency defined below:  \n\nDefinition  2.  The  decomposition (   {   (      )}   ) is  time-reversion  consistent \nwhen    (      )      (      )     for all  ,   , and   .  \n\nThe  time-reversion  consistency  requires  that  when  the  poverty  line  and  income  distribution \nrevert from the terminal state ( \u0303    \u0303 ) to the original state ( \u0303    \u0303 ), the reverse decomposition \nyields the same decomposition result except that each component has the opposite sign.  \n\nTo see why the time-reversion consistency is a reasonable requirement, imagine that you are \na time traveler. You start the travel at        and end at       . You observe all the changes \nbetween        and       ,  and  conduct  the  poverty  decomposition.  Now,  you  return  from \n       and        along  the  same  path  of  change  such  that  you  experience  all  the  changes \nbackwards.  If  the  time-reversion  consistency  is  not  satisfied,  some  components  contribute \neither  positively  or  negatively  to  the  poverty  measure  during  the  entire  time  travel,  even \nthough  all  the  changes  that  you  have  experienced  during  the  \u201coutgoing\u201d  travel  have  been \ncancelled during the \u201creturn\u201d travel.  \n\nOne  way  to  obtain  a  time-reversion  consistent  decomposition  is  to  take  the  average  of  KS \nand  JT  decompositions.  This  is  the  average  of  all  possible  sequences  (i.e.,  growth-\nredistribution and redistribution-growth in the standard two-way decomposition). Because this \ndecomposition  is  essentially  based  on  the  average  of  the  marginal  contributions  of  each \ncomponent in all the possible sequences, it is similar to the Shapley solution in cooperative \ngames  and  thus  called  the  Shapley  decomposition  (Kolenikov  and  Shorrocks  2005; \nMaasoumi and Mahmoudi 2013). Formally, each component in the Shapley decomposition is \ndefined as follows:  \n\nwhere     {      }.  \n\n,  \n\nIt  is  straightforward  to  verify  that  the  Shapley  decomposition  is  a  time-reversion  consistent \ndecomposition  (see  also  Kakwani  2000).  Unlike  KS  and  JT  decompositions,  the  Shapley \ndecomposition  can  also  be  extended  to  the  case  of  multiple  components.  Son  (2003) \nproposes  a  four-component  Shapley-type  decomposition  method  applied  to  the  rate  of \npoverty change for a general poverty measure.  \n\nThese features of the Shapley decomposition are attractive. However, as with DR, KS, and \nJT decompositions, it does not satisfy the subperiod additivity defined below:  \n\nDefinition  3.  Assume  that  we  have  observations  of  the  poverty  measure  and  other \nrelevant  parameters  at  time                      in  the  time  period  between          and \n         with                           .  Then,  the  decomposition (   {   (      )}   )  \nis subperiod additive when the following equation is satisfied for all      :  \n\n \n\n              \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(4) \n\n7 \n\n \n\n \n\n010101()(()())2cccSKSJTMttMttMtt\uf044\uf02c\uf0ba\uf044\uf02c\uf02b\uf044\uf02c\uf02f0111()()DccdddMttMss\uf02d\uf03d\uf044\uf02c\uf03d\uf044\uf02c\uf02e\uf0e5\fADBI Working Paper 466  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n       \n\n \n\n \n\n   Fujii \n\nThe  subperiod  consistency  requires  that  the  poverty  change  due  to  a  particular  component \nfor  two  contiguous  subperiods  is  equal  to  the  sum  of  the  poverty  change  due  to  that \ncomponent in each subperiod.5  \n\nDatt and Ravallion (1992) propose to address this problem by fixing the reference time point \n    [      ] for  the  decomposition  of  all  subperiods.  This  approach,  however,  is  not  ideal \nbecause the reference period lies outside most of the subperiods. Kakwani (2000) proposes \nanother  method  to  address  this  issue  but  his  method  is  also  unsatisfactory  because  an \nadditional  observation  changes  the  decomposition  results  for  all  subperiods.  In  the  next \nsubsection,  therefore,  we  propose  a  simple  decomposition  method  that  addresses  all  the \nissues mentioned above. \n\n2.2  New Method of Dynamic Poverty Decomposition \n\nTo  derive  a  decomposition  method  that  is  residual-free,  time-reversion  consistent,  and \n with  respect  to \nsubperiod  additive,  we  can  first  consider  an  infinitesimal  change  of \ntime \n and  find  growth  and  redistribution  components  for  this  change.  This  allows  us  to \nignore  the  (second-order)  interaction  effect  so  that  the  results  are  residual-free.  By \nintegrating  each  component  over  the  time  interval  of  interest,  we  obtain  the  growth  and \nredistribution  components.  Because  the  reference  time  point  is  already  built-in  in  this \ndecomposition  method,  our  method  is  clearly  time-reversion  consistent.  The  subperiod \nadditivity follows from the property of integration. Despite this simplicity of the method, this is \nthe first paper to employ time derivative and integration to poverty decomposition.6  \nUsing the notations introduced in Section 2.1, we can obtain the following results:7  \n\nProposition 1. Let     {      } and define the following:  \n\n \n\n \n\n            \n\n \n\n \n\n(5) \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n(6) \n\nThen,  the  pair    (   {   (      )}   ) is  a  time-reversion  consistent  and  subperiod-\nadditive poverty decomposition.  \n\nFour  points  are  in  order.  First,  we  chose  to  use  the  cumulative  distribution  function  of  the \nrelative income  \u0303 to represent our decomposition. In a number of previous studies of poverty \ndecomposition, however, the Lorenz curve has been used. Because the Lorenz curve and  \u0303 \ncarry  the  same  information,  we  can  rewrite  equations  (5)  and (6)  using  the  Lorenz  curve. \nHowever, we choose to use  \u0303 for simplicity of presentation.  \n\n   (      )     holds  when  \u0303( \u0303   ) is  constant \nSecond,  it  is  straightforward  to  verify  that   \n    is driven by the changes in the distribution \nover     [      ] for given  \u0303. In other words,   \nif  \u0303 is \nand  thus  we  call  it  the  redistribution  component.  Similarly,  we  have   \n    the growth component, even \nconstant over  . In line with the previous studies, we call   \nthough it  is  driven  by  the changes in both   and  .  The  reason that  we  do  so is  that  all the \n\n   (      )    \n\n \n\n                                                \n5\n If  we  allow   to  be  outside  the  interval  between    and    and    (      ) is  continuous,  then  time-reversion \nconsistency follows from subperiod additivity. To see this, first let        . Then, we must have    (      )      \nby eq. (4). By letting               and        , we have        (      )      (      )  , proving the claim. \n\n6\n In the context of source decomposition of changes in inequality, Okamoto (2011) proposes an integration-based \n\napproach to justify Shapley-type decomposition.  \n\n7\n All the proofs are provided in Appendix B. \n\n \n\n8 \n\n()Mtt10010()()ddtzRDtyfytMttgytzt\uf02a\uf0e9\uf0f9\uf0b6\uf02c\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf044\uf02c\uf0ba\uf0ea\uf0fa\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0b6\uf0e8\uf0f8\uf0eb\uf0fb\uf0f2\uf0f2100120d()(1)()()dddtzGRtyyzMttgfztgfytytztz\uf02a\uf0e9\uf0f9\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf0a2\uf044\uf02c\uf0ba\uf02c\uf02d\uf02c\uf02e\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0ea\uf0fa\uf0e8\uf0f8\uf0eb\uf0fb\uf0f2\uf0f2\fADBI Working Paper 466  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n       \n\n \n\n \n\n   Fujii \n\nchanges are due to growth (change in the mean income) once the poverty line is fixed, which \nis what is assumed in most previous studies on poverty decomposition.  \n\n    in equation (5) represents the change in \nThird, the first [second] term in the integral in   \npoverty  in the  extensive [intensive] margin  of  poverty. The second  term  is  0 for  the  poverty \nrate measure and the first term is 0 for the Watts measure and the FGT measure with      . \nTherefore, in our applications, only one of these two terms matters.  \n\n     and    \n\n     include  both   \u0303 and   \u0303  in  their \nFourth,  equations (5)  and (6)  show  that    \nintegrations and thus depend on the way  \u0303 and  \u0303 vary between        and       . This means \nthat the decomposition is path-dependent. Therefore, to implement equations (5) and (6), we \nneed the observation of  \u0303 and  \u0303 over     [      ] in general.  \nIn a typical application, however, we observe them only at the beginning and end of the time \ninterval  (i.e.,        and       )  and  possibly  a  few  other  time  points  in  between.  Therefore, \nwe need to make some assumptions about the path to make the decomposition operational. \nOnce the assumptions are made, we can calculate the integrals in equations (5) and (6) by \nnumerical integration for a general form of  \u0303 and  \u0303.  \n\nIn each of the next two subsections, we make a set of specific assumptions about the path of \n \u0303 and  \u0303.  In  each  case,  they  simultaneously  and  smoothly  change  over  time,  which  is  more \nrealistic  than  the  sequential  changes  (implicitly)  assumed  in  the  DR,  KS,  JT,  and  Shapley \ndecompositions. We  show  that  our  assumptions  lead  to  a  convenient  expression  that  does \nnot require numerical integration. \n\n2.3  Poverty Rate Decomposition under Linear Approximation \n\nIn this subsection, we assume that both  \u0303 and  \u0303 vary linearly between        and       . This \nassumption  is  not  very  restrictive,  because  it  can  be  interpreted  as  taking  a  first-order \napproximation  to  an  unknown  functional  form  of   \u0303  and   \u0303  with  respect  to    .  We  define \n \u0303     \u0303(  ) and  \u0303 ( )    \u0303(     ) for     {   } to simplify the expressions below. For example,  \u0303  \nand  \u0303  are the relative poverty lines at the initial and terminal time points, respectively. Using \nthese notations, our linearity assumption is as follows:  \n\nAssumption 1. For      [      ],  \u0303 and  \u0303 respectively satisfy the following equations:  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(8) \n\n   \n\n(7) \n\nwhere    \n\n    \n     \n\n.  \n\nWe focus on the poverty rate measure    because it is the most frequently used measure of \npoverty in the literature and leads to a final expression that is simple and easy to implement, \nas shown in the following proposition:  \n\nProposition  2.  Suppose  that  Assumption 1,   \u0303     \u0303  ,  and          hold.  Then,  the \npoverty decomposition given in Proposition 1 can be written as follows:  \n\n   \n\n(9) \n\n       \n\n \n\n \n\n(10) \n\nWe  added  the  subscript   to  the  left-hand-side  variable  to  emphasize  that  this  is  the  linear \napproximation.  In  equation  (9),   ( \u0303    \u0303 ) for     {   }   and     {   }   is  simply  the  poverty \ngap  calculated  with  the  relative  income  distribution  for          and  relative  poverty  line \nfor       . In equation (10),   ( \u0303    \u0303 ) for     {   }  is just the poverty rate at       .

The  discussion \n   (      ) in \nabove  shows  that  we  should  generally  prefer    \nthe  absence  of  other  information,  because  the  piecewise  linear  approximation  is  likely  to \nproduce more accurate approximation to the underlying path of change than the na\u00efve linear \napproximation  between      and     .  This  argument  does  not  immediately  apply  to  other \ndecompositions.  That  is,  for     {             },  it  is  not  immediately  apparent  whether  we \n   (      ) because the former entails an implicit \nshould favor   \nchange in the reference period or the sequence of change. For example, in the case of   , \nthe  former  uses  two  different  reference  time  periods;    for  the  poverty  change  between \n   and    and    for the change between    and   .  \nIn  Proposition 2,  we  excluded  the  possibility  of  \u0303     \u0303 .

However,  it  should  be  noted \nthat  \u0303     \u0303  does not imply   \nFigure 1  is  useful  for  interpreting  the  decomposition  results  given  in  equations  (9)  and (10) \nand  for  comparing  our  method  with  previously  proposed  methods.  The  figure  provides  a \ngraphical  representation  of  the  cumulative  distribution  function  of  relative  income  and  the \nrelative poverty line at        and       . The lengths of line segments    and    respectively \nrepresent the poverty rate at        and       , or   ( \u0303    \u0303 ) and   ( \u0303    \u0303 ).

If the changes in the relative poverty line and the \nrelative  income  distribution  take  place  sequentially,  this  decomposition  is  straightforward \nbecause  we  only  need  to  look  at  one  component  at  a  time.  In  this  case,  the  redistribution \n[growth] component measures the effect of the change in the relative income distribution [the \nrelative  poverty  line].  Graphically,  the  redistribution  component  is  the  vertical  distance \nbetween  the  two  cumulative  distributions  \u0303  and  \u0303  at  a  particular  \u0303 ,  whereas  the  growth \ncomponent is the difference in a particular cumulative distribution between  \u0303  and  \u0303 .  \nIf we assume that the change in the relative poverty line precedes [follows] the change in the \nrelative  income  distribution,  we  obtain  the  KS  [JT]  decomposition.  The  growth  and \nredistribution  components  are  the  lengths  of  line  segments    [  ]  and    [  ], respectively, \nin  Figure 1.  In  the  case  of  the  DR  decomposition,  the  growth  and  redistribution  component \nare    and   ,  respectively,  and  the  residual  component  is  what  is  not  explained  by  these \nterms,  which  is             .  The  Shapley  decomposition  is  simply  the  average  of  the  KS \nand JT decompositions, respectively.  \nTo  interpret  equation (9),  first  note  that   \u0303   ( \u0303    \u0303 ) represents  the  average  shortfall  per \nperson from the poverty line relative to the mean income. Therefore,  \u0303   ( \u0303    \u0303 ) is the area \nbelow  the  cumulative  distribution  function  \u0303  and  to  the  left  of  \u0303  (see  also  equation  (B2)  in \nAppendix B). For example,  \u0303   ( \u0303    \u0303 ) is the area of   and   combined. It is straightforward \nto verify that the  numerator  of the  right-hand  side of  equation  (9)  is  area  .  By  dividing this \narea  by  \u0303     \u0303  ,  we  see  that  the  redistribution  component  is  represented  by  the  vertical \ndistance  between  \u0303  and  \u0303  averaged  over  \u0303   { \u0303    \u0303 }.  Suppose  now  that  the  redistribution \ncomponent  is     in  Figure 1.  Then,  the  shaded  parallelogram  has  the  same  area  as   . \nEquation (10) shows that the growth component is the part of poverty change not accounted \nfor by the redistribution component, which is    in Figure 1.  \n\nFigure 1 also allows us to show the relationship between the Shapley decomposition and our \ndecomposition.  While  taking  the  average  of  possible  sequential  changes  appears  arbitrary, \nour results show that it is not completely unreasonable. To see this, first note that we obtain \nthe Shapley redistribution component if we replace the numerator of equation (9) by the area \nof the trapezoid (not explicitly drawn) with two bases    and   . Therefore, we can consider \nthe  Shapley  decomposition  as  a  way  to  approximate  the  area     by  this  trapezoid.  In \nparticular,  if  the  cumulative  distribution  functions   \u0303  and   \u0303  are  linear  between   \u0303    \u0303  and \n \u0303    \u0303  ,  the  Shapley  decomposition  is  exactly  equal  to  our  linear  approximation  in \nProposition 2.  \n\n2.4  Poverty Rate Decomposition under Log-Linear Approximation \n\nAssumption 1  may  be  reasonable  when  the  change  in  \u0303 is  relatively  small.  However,  when \nthe  economy  is  experiencing  rapid  economic  growth  for  a  long  period  of  time,  the  linearity \nassumption  in  Assumption 1  may  not  be  appropriate.  In  such  a  case,  we  may  be  able  to \nobtain  a  better  approximation  by  making  a  linear  approximation  with  respect  to  the \nlogarithmic  relative  income  \u0303      \u0303 and  logarithmic  relative  poverty  line  \u0303      \u0303.

Therefore, the numerator  of  the \n    is the vertical distance between  \u0303   and \nright-hand side of equation (13) is area   and     \n \u0303   averaged over  \u0303   [ \u0303    \u0303 ].  \n\nFigure 2: Graphical Representation of Poverty Rate Decomposition  \nunder Assumption 2 \n\nSource: Author\u2019s own illustration \n\n \n\nFigure 2  also  helps  us  to  understand  the  relationship  between  our  poverty  decomposition \nanalysis  and  pro-poor  growth.  Notice  first  that  \u0303  \n  ( ) for     {   } is  the  100p-percentile \nlogarithmic income. Therefore, the growth incidence curve proposed by Ravallion and Chen \n(2003), which is the growth of income for each quantile, appears as the horizontal distance \nbetween  \u0303  \n  ( ) and  \u0303  \n  ( )  \nis to the left of (i.e., smaller than)  \u0303  \n  ( ). An overall measure of pro-poor growth proposed \nby  Son  and  Kakwani  (2008,  equation  (13))  is  the  integral  of    ( )   over  the  unit  interval. \nThis simply appears as the net area between  \u0303   and  \u0303  , which is negative in Figure 2. \n\n  ( ) in  Figure 2.8 In  the  graph,    ( ) is  negative  because  \u0303  \n\n                                                \n8\n Ravallion  and  Chen  (2003)  uses  a  discrete  time  model  and  their  growth  rate  is  the  growth  per  period.  The \ngrowth in Figure 2 also refers to the growth in the time period between        and        and is expressed as a \ndifference in the logarithmic income per capita. \n\n \n\n12 \n\n101011000110()()()()()RDllWWWWzzzzFFFFMtt\uf07a\uf07a\uf02a\uf02c\uf02d\uf02c\uf02d\uf02c\uf02b\uf02c\uf044\uf02c\uf03d\uf02d1010010001()()()()GRRDllllMttPPMttzzFF\uf02a\uf02a\uf044\uf02c\uf03d\uf02c\uf02d\uf02c\uf02d\uf044\uf02c\uf02e\fADBI Working Paper 466  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n       \n\n \n\n \n\n   Fujii \n\n2.5  Robustness Check with a Speed of Change Parameter \n\nThe  KS  and  JT  decompositions  implicitly  assume  that  the  mean  and  distribution  of  income \nchange  sequentially.  The  RD  and  Shapley  decompositions  do  not  impose  a  particular \nsequence,  but  their  calculations  are  also  based  on  some  sequential  changes.  Our  results \npresented in sections 2.3 and 2.4, on the other hand, are based on the assumption that both \nchange simultaneously and smoothly, which is more realistic.  \n\nHowever,  one  could  argue  that  Assumption 1  is  strong  because  both  relative  income \ndistribution and relative poverty line are assumed to change at the \u201csame speed.\u201d Therefore, \nwe relax Assumption 1 and replace equation (8) with the following equation:  \n\n            \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(15) \n\nwhere  (   ) is the parameter that describes the speed of change for  \u0303 relative to  \u0303. When   \nis  large,  most  of  the  changes  in  \u0303 occur  when  \u0303 is  already  close  to  \u0303 .  In  fact,  when  we  let \n     , the decomposition converges to the JT decomposition. On the other hand, when we \nlet      , the decomposition converges to the KS decomposition. Therefore, by varying  , we \ncan  check  the  robustness  of  the  results  in  Proposition 2.  It  is  also  possible  to  do  a  similar \nrobustness  check  for  Proposition 3  by  replacing     with      in  the  right-hand  side  of \nequation (12).  \n\n2.6  Extension to Six-Way Decomposition \n\nIn this subsection, we consider a more detailed decomposition, in which the poverty change \nin  each  group  in  the  population  is  decomposed  into  six  components.  While  each  group \nrepresents a region in our application, it may represent other household characteristics such \nas the household size and the sector in which the household head works. Our decomposition \nis useful because researchers and policy makers are often interested in finding which group \nis  contributing  to  national  poverty  change  and  why.  While  we  consider  a  particular  six-\ncomponent decomposition, our decomposition can be easily modified to have more or fewer \ncomponents.  \n\nIt  should  also  be  noted  that  our  decomposition  presented  in  Proposition 4  below  can  be \nconsidered  as  an  integration of the  sector-based decomposition  proposed  by  Ravallion  and \nHuppi (1991) and the growth-redistribution decomposition discussed earlier. Unlike Ravallion \nand  Huppi  (1991),  however,  our  decomposition  does  not  have  an  interaction  term,  whose \ninterpretation  is  not  straightforward.  Therefore,  our  results  allow  researchers  and  policy \nmakers to identify the source of poverty change more easily and more clearly.  \n\nWe  hereafter  assume  that  there  are   groups  (e.g.,  regions  or  sectors)  in  the  country  and \neach  group   has  a  group-specific  poverty  line   ( ) at  time  .  We  further  assume  that  the \n ( ) are the price \n \n ( )  \ngroup-specific poverty lines satisfy      \u2211\n  \n   \nand  quantity  of  good     {        } consumed  by  a  typical  household  near  the  poverty  line  in \ngroup  . Therefore, the poverty lines may change not only by the changes in prices but also \nby the changes in the underlying bundle of goods.  \nWe denote the population share of group   by   . The income distribution of group   has the \nprobability density function    and cumulative distribution function   . Therefore, we have:  \n\n ( ) and   \n\n, where   \n\n ( )\n\nfor  all   and  .

We denote the income relative to \nthe  group  mean  by   \u0302        \u2044\n and  the  poverty  line  relative  to  the  group  mean  by   \u0302    \n      \u2044        \u0302  \n.

We  use  hat \nnotations (  \u0302) here to emphasize that the relative income is relative to the group mean. Using \nthese notations, we can construct the following six-way decomposition:  \n\nProposition 4. Let \n\n and define the following terms:  \n\n \n\n     for       is the contribution of group   to component  , which is denoted \ntime-reversion \n\nwhere    \nby     \nconsistent and subperiod-additive poverty decomposition.  \n\n   (      )}   )  is  a \n\nthe  pair  (   {   \n\n      \u2211    \n\n.  Then, \n\n    \n\n \n\n     is  the  population-shift  component  because  it  accounts  for  the \nThe  first  component,    \npoverty changes due to the changes in the relative size of each group. The population-shift \ncomponent represents both inter-group migration and differences in the mortality and fertility \nacross  groups.  When         ,  the  population-shift  component  positively  contributes  to \npoverty  reduction  when  the  size  of  wealthier  groups  grows  faster  than  the  size  of  poorer \ngroups. For example, if we define groups to be urban and rural areas, we can measure the \ndemographic effect of urbanization on poverty by the population-shift component.  \n\n     is the within-group redistribution component, which accounts \nThe second component,    \nfor  the  poverty  change  due  to  the  change  in the  relative  income  distribution  in  each  group. \n     is  the  between-group  redistribution  component,  because  it  is \nThe  third  component,    \ndriven by the change in the ratio of the group-level mean income to the population mean.  \n\n      can  be  called  the  nominal  growth  component  because  it \nThe  fourth  component,     \nrepresents the  change in poverty  due to the  change  in the  nominal  mean  income. The fifth \n     can  be  considered  the  inflation  component,  because  it  represents  the \ncomponent,    \npoverty change due to the changes in the price of the bundle of goods for the poverty line. \n     can be called the methodological change component, because \nThe sixth component,    \nthis is the poverty change due to the quantity changes in the underlying bundle of goods for \nthe poverty line. The fifth and sixth components combined represent the changes in poverty \ndue to the shift in the nominal poverty lines.  \n\nAs with the previous cases, we need to make some assumptions about the path of change to \nimplement  the  decomposition  in  Proposition 4.  Therefore,  we  simply  assume  that   ,  \u0302 , \n change  linearly.  That  is,  we  first  estimate  \u0302  by  kernel  density  estimation \n ,  and   \n ,  \u0302      \n for  all   at         and        .  Then,  we  take  the  linear \nand  calculate   ,  ,  \u0302      \n\n  ,  and   \n\n \n\n14 \n\n{}CPSWRBRNGIFMC\uf0ba\uf02c\uf02c\uf02c\uf02c\uf02c101010\u02c6010\u02c6010\u02c601220\u02c6d\u02c6\u02c6()ddd\u02c6\u02c6\u02c6\u02c6()dd\u02c6\u02c6\u02c6d\u02c6\u02c6\u02c6()(1)()d\u02c6()\u02c6()\u02c6\u02c6ggggtzgPSggtgtzWRgggtgtzggBRggggggtwyMttgytftzyfMttwgyttzyyzMttwgtgyzffzz\uf06d\uf06d\uf02a\uf02a\uf02a\uf02a\uf02a\uf02a\uf0e9\uf0f9\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf044\uf02c\uf0ba\uf0ea\uf0fa\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0e8\uf0f8\uf0eb\uf0fb\uf0e9\uf0f9\uf0b6\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf0ea\uf0fa\uf044\uf02c\uf0ba\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0b6\uf0e8\uf0f8\uf0ea\uf0fa\uf0eb\uf0fb\uf0e9\uf0f9\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf0a2\uf044\uf02c\uf0ba\uf02d\uf02c\uf02d\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0ea\uf0fa\uf0e8\uf0f8\uf0eb\uf0fb\uf0f2\uf0f2\uf0f2\uf0f2\uf0f2\uf0f21010\u02c601220\u02c60120\u02c6dd\u02c6\u02c6d\u02c6\u02c6\u02c6()(1)()dd\u02c6d()\u02c6\u02c6\u02c6d\u02c6\u02c61\u02c6\u02c6\u02c6()(1)()d\u02c6d()\u02c6\u02c6\u02c6ggggtzggNGggggggtggtzggjjIFggggggtjttyyzMttwgtgytzfftzzqpyyMttwgtgyzfftzz\uf06d\uf06d\uf06d\uf06d\uf06d\uf06d\uf02a\uf02a\uf02a\uf02a\uf0e9\uf0f9\uf0ea\uf0fa\uf0eb\uf0fb\uf0e9\uf0f9\uf0e9\uf0f9\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf0a2\uf044\uf02c\uf0ba\uf02d\uf02c\uf02d\uf0ea\uf0fa\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0ea\uf0fa\uf0e8\uf0f8\uf0eb\uf0fb\uf0eb\uf0fb\uf0e9\uf0e9\uf0f9\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf0a2\uf044\uf02c\uf0ba\uf02c\uf02d\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0ea\uf0fa\uf0e8\uf0f8\uf0eb\uf0fb\uf0f2\uf0f2\uf0e5\uf0f2\uf0f210\u02c60120dd\u02c6\u02c61\u02c6\u02c6\u02c6()(1)()dd\u02c6d()\u02c6\u02c6\u02c6gggtzggjjMCggggggtjtpqyyMttwgtgytzfftzz\uf06d\uf06d\uf02a\uf02a\uf0f9\uf0ea\uf0fa\uf0ea\uf0fa\uf0eb\uf0fb\uf0e9\uf0f9\uf0e9\uf0f9\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf0a2\uf044\uf02c\uf0ba\uf02c\uf02d\uf02c\uf0ea\uf0fa\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0ea\uf0fa\uf0e8\uf0f8\uf0ea\uf0fa\uf0eb\uf0fb\uf0eb\uf0fb\uf0e5\uf0f2\uf0f2\fADBI Working Paper 466  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n       \n\n \n\n \n\n   Fujii \n\ninterpolation.

Therefore, the choice of kernel density function and bandwidth used \nin  the  estimation  of  \u0303 affects  the  results.  Following  the  standard  choice  in  the  literature,  we \nuse  the  Epanechnikov  kernel  density  function.  Typically,  the  choice  of  the  kernel  density \nfunction is not particularly important.9  \n\nHowever, the choice of the bandwidth is important and can affect the decomposition results \nin a non-negligible manner. If we use a small bandwidth, the resulting poverty estimates are \ncloser  to  those  directly  calculated  from  the  observed  data.  However,  the  graph  of  the \nestimated  density  function  is  likely  to  be  more  spiky.  On  the  other  hand,  if  we  use  a  large \nbandwidth, the estimate of  \u0303 is likely to become inaccurate.  \n\nThis issue is particularly important for the decomposition of   . If the bandwidth is too small, \n \u0303 takes a very high value near observed income levels and 0 for all other values. In this case, \nwe  cannot  estimate   \u0303  very  accurately,  which  makes  it  difficult  to  perform  the  numerical \nintegration required for decomposition.  \n\nGiven  the  considerations  mentioned  above,  we  set  the  half-width  of  kernel  at          (i.e., \none percentage point in the relative income), which is small enough to reproduce the poverty \nstatistics that are very close to poverty statistics derived directly from the original sample but \nlarge enough to eliminate the spikes in the density estimate from our data. All the empirical \nresults presented in section 4 that rely on kernel density estimation are based on this choice \nof bandwidth.10  \n\nTo  implement  the  numerical  integration,  we  adopted  the  following  procedure.  First,  we \nestimate  \u0303(     ) and  \u0303(     ) on a set of fixed evaluation points {              }, where   is the \nnumber  of  evaluation  points,       ,  and       \u0303( ) for  all     [      ].  Second,  following  the \ninterpolation  rule  specified  in  the  assumption  (e.g.,  equation (7)),  we  derive  \u0303(    )   on  each \nevaluation  point  at  time  {              } ,  where          ,          ,  and     is  the  number  of \nevaluation points for the outer integral in Proposition 1. Third, using the estimate of  \u0303(    ), we \nevaluate  the  inner  integral  using  a  numerical  integration method.  Once  we  obtain  the  inner \nintegral, we evaluate the outer integral in a  similar manner.11 To obtain sufficiently accurate \nresults, we set                in our empirical application.12 \n\n                                                \n9\n Note here that we only need the kernel density estimates for the lower tail for our analysis. By focusing on the \n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nlower tail, we can reduce the memory usage. \n In Appendix D, we present the results with 50% larger and smaller bandwidth to verify the robustness of our \nresults. \n We  implemented  this  with  a  quadratic  interpolation,  which  is  essentially  Simpson\u2019s  rule.  We  make  some \nadjustments,  because  the  upper  end  of  the  integral,   \u0303 ,  varies  over  time  and  does  not  coincide  with  an \nevaluation point in general. Also, because   \u0303   \u2044  diverges to infinity at        when       under the assumption \nof eq. (15), we use a linear approximation of the expression inside the square bracket in eq. (6) in this case to \ncalculate the integral over the first interval (i.e., [      ]). The details of this treatment are given in Appendix C. \n Comparison of the numerical integration results under linear assumption with the analytical results presented in \nSection 2.3 indicates that the margin of the error is at most 0.004 percentage points for two-way decomposition \nanalysis.  For  other  results,  we  cannot  directly  evaluate  the  accuracy  of  our  numerical  results.  However,  the \ncomparison  between  the  sum  of  each  component  in  the  decomposition  analysis  and  the  observed  change \nprovides  some  guidance.  According  to  this  criterion,  the  six-way  decomposition  in  Section 4  is  slightly  less \n\n \n\n \n\n15 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 466  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n       \n\n \n\n \n\n   Fujii \n\n3.  DATA AND POVERTY MEASUREMENT \n\nWe  use  the  public  user  files  for  the  following  nine  rounds  of  the  Family  Income  and \nExpenditure Survey (FIES): 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006, and 2009. The \nFIES  was collected  by  the  National  Statistics  Office  (NSO). The  FIES  data  include income, \nexpenditure,  and  various  other  household information. They  are  used for  calculating  official \npoverty  statistics  published  by  the  National  Statistical  Coordination  Board  (NSCB).  For  the \nsix-way decomposition in Proposition 4, we also use the price data taken from the consumer \nprice  index  (CPI),  also  collected  by  the  NSO.  As  noted  earlier,  we  take  each  region  as  a \ngroup  in  the  six-way  decomposition,  but  the  definition  of  regions  in  the  Philippines  has \nchanged over time. Thus, we choose to adopt the latest definition, which has 17 regions, and \nconstructed  the  region  variable  under  this  definition  for  earlier  rounds  of  FIES  from  the \nprovince variable in the data.  \n\nThe  distribution  of  the  logarithmic  nominal  annual  income  per  capita  in  the  Philippines  is \npresented  in  Figure 3. The figure  shows  that  the  distribution  in each  FIES  round  after  1985 \nfirst-order stochastically dominates the previous round, implying that the nominal income has \nincreased for both the rich and the poor in the Philippines. However, this figure ignores the \ninflation  and  heterogeneity  across  regions,  and  thus  does  not  provide  a  clear  picture  about \nthe  sources  of  poverty  change  in  the  Philippines.  Therefore,  the  poverty  decomposition \nmethods developed in the previous section are useful.  \n\nFigure 3: Cumulative Distribution Function of the Logarithmic Income per Capita  \nper Year in Philippine Pesos \n\nSource: Author\u2019s calculation based on Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) data. \n\n \n\nTo  implement  the  decomposition,  we  first  need  to  set  the  poverty  lines.  A  natural  choice \nwould be  the  NSCB\u2019s  official  poverty  lines,  because  the  official  poverty  statistics  are  widely \nused  by  the  government  and  are  one  of  the  most  important  statistics  for  the  formulation of \npoverty reduction policies in the Philippines.  \n\nHowever, the official methodology for setting the poverty lines has been revised three times. \nAs  clearly  seen  in  Figure 4,  the  estimates  based  on  different  revisions  of  methodology  are \n\n                                                                                                                                                   \naccurate. However, our estimates (in percentage points) are accurate at least up to the first decimal point and \nup to the second decimal point in most cases. Detailed results are provided in Appendix D. \n\n \n\n16 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 466  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n       \n\n \n\n \n\n   Fujii \n\nnot  directly  comparable  because  poverty  estimates  for  a  given  year  may  vary  substantially \nwith the methodology employed. Moreover, no revision of the official methodology covers the \nentire  nine  rounds  of  FIES,  making  it  difficult  to  understand  the  nature  of  the  long-term \npoverty  changes  in  the  Philippines.  Furthermore,  even  when  the  same  revision  of \nmethodology  is  used,  the  comparability  of  official  poverty  statistics  over  time  and  across \nregions has been disputed (Balisacan 2003; Bernales 2009) and multiple versions of \u201cofficial\u201d \nestimates appear to exist for some years.  \n\nFigure 4: Comparison between Official Poverty Statistics and Our Poverty Statistics \n\nNote: The horizontal and vertical axis indicate the calendar year and the poverty rate in percentage, respectively.  \n\nSource: \nhttp://www.nscb.gov.ph/poverty/2009/table_2.asp. \n\nOfficial \n\nfigures \n\ncompiled \n\nare \n\nfrom \n\nAsian \n\nDevelopment \n\nBank \n\n(2005) \n\nand \n\n \n\nHence, we chose to adopt a modified version of the 2011 revision of the official methodology \nand  produced  our  own  back  estimates.  For  the  years  in  which  official  poverty  estimates \nbased on the 2011 revision of the methodology are available, our poverty statistics are very \nsimilar  to  the  official  poverty  statistics  as  shown  in  Figure 4.  They  also  have  a  trend  very \nsimilar  to  official  poverty  statistics  for  other  years.  Therefore,  our  poverty  statistics  capture \nwell  the  changes  in  the  official  poverty  statistics  over  time.  Further  details  on  the  data  and \npoverty measurement for this study are provided in Appendix A. \n\n4.  RESULTS \n\nIn  this  section,  we  present  various  decomposition  results.  We  start  with  the  two-way \ndecomposition  under the  linear  approximation  discussed in  section 2.3, the results  of  which \nare given in Table 1. While convenient analytical results under linear approximation are only \navailable for the poverty rate   , we have also carried out the decomposition for poverty gap \n  ,  poverty  severity   ,  and  the  Watts  measure   by  numerical  integration.13 The  first  two \ncolumns  in  Table 1  provide  the  initial  year    and  the  terminal  year    .  For  each  poverty \n\n                                                \n13\n\n The decomposition result for P0 reported in Table 1 is based on Proposition 2 and thus derived without kernel \ndensity  estimation. For  all  other  decomposition  results,  kernel density  estimation is  used.  In  the case of  two-\nway decomposition,  \u0303 is estimated for the Philippines. In the case of six-way decomposition,  \u0303  is estimated for \neach region of the Philippines. This leads to a small discrepancy in   across tables. \n\n \n\n17 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 466  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n       \n\n \n\n \n\n   Fujii \n\nmeasure,  we  report  the  initial  level  of  poverty  (  ),  the  change   in  the  poverty  measure \nbetween     and    ,  the  growth  component    ,  and  the  redistribution  component    .  For \nexample,  the  growth  component  of  the  change  in  poverty  gap  between  1994  and  1997  is  \n-3.40 percentage points. The last row (all periods) is the sum of all the changes in the eight \n3-year periods. \n\nTable 1 shows  that  the  poverty  changes  in  the Philippines  have  been  largely  driven  by  the \ngrowth  component.  Notice  here  that  the  growth  component  in  this  analysis  refers  to  the \nchange in poverty due to the relative poverty line, or the poverty line over the mean income. \nTherefore,  the  effect  of  inflation  at  the  poverty  line  is  already  accounted  for  in  the  growth \ncomponent.  \n\nTable 1  also  shows  that  the  patterns  of  poverty  change  are  similar  across  all  the  poverty \nmeasures  considered  here.  Over  the  periods  between  1985  and  2009,  about  30%  of  the \npoverty  reduction  achieved  by  economic  growth  has  been  offset  by  worsened  income \ninequality, regardless of the poverty measure used. Most of the effects of worsening income \ninequality took place in the two periods 1988\u20131991 and 1994\u20131997.    \n\nOne concern about this analysis is that the results may be driven by our linearity assumption. \nTherefore,  we  have  carried  out  a  robustness  check  assuming  equations (7)  and (15)  as \ndescribed in section 2.5. Table 2 shows the decomposition results for the poverty rate using \nvarious values  of   and a few  other methods  described  in  section 2. The third column,  ,  is \n   ,  is  the  growth \nthe  change  in  poverty  rate  between      and     .  The  fourth  column,     \ncomponent  in the  KS  decomposition,  which  corresponds  to      . The fifth column,         \u2044\n, \n  , are the same \nis the growth component for        \u2044 . The results in the seventh column,    \n   ,  is  the  growth \nas  those  presented  in  the  fifth  column  of  Table 1.  The  tenth  column,    \ncomponent for the JT decompositions, which corresponds to      . As shown in the fifth to \ntenth columns of Table 2, the decomposition results are quite stable.  \n\n  \n\n   ,  is  the  growth  component  in  the  Shapley  decomposition.  The \nThe  eleventh  column,   \n  , is the growth component under the log-linear approximation discussed in \ntwelfth column,     \nSection 4. These  decomposition  results  are  also similar to the  results  presented  in Table 1. \n   , is the residual component in the DR decomposition, which turns out to \nThe last column,    \nbe  small.  Thus,  our  decomposition  results  and  the  decomposition  results  based  on  the \nexisting  methods  are  generally  close  in  the  Philippines  for  the  time  periods  we  have \nconsidered. \n\nHowever,  our  finding  does  not  imply  that  the  choice  of  decomposition  method  does  not \nmatter. To see how much the choice of method may matter, we carry out an experiment for \npoverty  rate  decomposition. We  assume that the  linearity  assumption  is satisfied  piecewise \nfor  all  eight  3-year  periods  from  1985  to  2009  and  treat  the  decomposition  under  this \nassumption as the benchmark decomposition result. We then drop from the data some years \nin  between  and  calculate  the  growth  component  of  poverty  change  for  each  period  in  the \ndata (e.g., if years 1988, 1991, 1994, 2003, and 2006 are dropped from the data, there are \nthree periods: 1985\u20131997, 1997\u20132000, and 2000\u20132009) and add the growth component for \nthese periods to arrive  at  an  estimate of the growth component for the  entire  period  1985\u2013\n2009. We do this for all the possible combinations for each number of observations dropped. \nWe  then  calculate  the  maximum  and  mean  absolute  deviation  of  the  estimated  growth \ncomponent  from  the  benchmark  growth  component.  Note  here  that  whether  we  use  the \ngrowth  component  or  redistribution  component  makes  no  difference  in  the  two-way \ndecomposition because the change in poverty between 1985 and 2009 is fixed and thus the \nabsolute deviations are the same for growth and redistribution components.  \n\n \n\n18 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 466 \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n       \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFujii \n\nTable 1: Comparison of Two-Way Decomposition Results across Various Poverty Measures \n\n  \n\n  \n\nPoverty rate (P0) \n\nPoverty gap (P1) \n\nPoverty severity (P2) \n\nWatts measure (W) \n\n   \n\n   \n\n (  ) \n\n  \n\n   \n\n   \n\n (  ) \n\n  \n\n   \n\n   \n\n (  ) \n\n  \n\n   \n\n   \n\n (  ) \n\n  \n\n   \n\n   \n\n1985  1988 \n\n35.83 \n\n-3.07 \n\n-2.82 \n\n-0.25 \n\n11.13 \n\n-1.46 \n\n-1.12 \n\n-0.34 \n\n4.82 \n\n-0.85 \n\n-0.56 \n\n-0.29 \n\n15.08 \n\n-2.28 \n\n-1.61 \n\n-0.67 \n\n1988  1991 \n\n32.76 \n\n0.08 \n\n-3.15 \n\n3.23 \n\n9.66 \n\n0.24 \n\n-1.33 \n\n1.57 \n\n3.97 \n\n0.21 \n\n-0.66 \n\n0.87 \n\n12.80 \n\n0.48 \n\n-1.90 \n\n2.39 \n\n1991  1994 \n\n32.84 \n\n-4.21 \n\n-2.49 \n\n-1.72 \n\n9.90 \n\n-1.45 \n\n-1.01 \n\n-0.44 \n\n4.18 \n\n-0.66 \n\n-0.50 \n\n-0.16 \n\n13.28 \n\n-2.01 \n\n-1.44 \n\n-0.57 \n\n1994  1997 \n\n28.63 \n\n-2.68 \n\n-8.47 \n\n5.79 \n\n8.45 \n\n-0.84 \n\n-3.40 \n\n2.56 \n\n3.52 \n\n-0.39 \n\n-1.67 \n\n1.28 \n\n11.27 \n\n-1.19 \n\n-4.83 \n\n3.64 \n\n1997  2000 \n\n25.95 \n\n0.86 \n\n0.98 \n\n-0.12 \n\n7.61 \n\n0.22 \n\n0.39 \n\n-0.17 \n\n3.13 \n\n0.06 \n\n0.19 \n\n-0.13 \n\n10.08 \n\n0.26 \n\n0.55 \n\n-0.29 \n\n2000  2003 \n\n26.80 \n\n-2.52 \n\n-1.01 \n\n-1.51 \n\n7.83 \n\n-0.75 \n\n-0.39 \n\n-0.36 \n\n3.20 \n\n-0.28 \n\n-0.19 \n\n-0.09 \n\n10.34 \n\n-0.96 \n\n-0.55 \n\n-0.41 \n\n2003  2006 \n\n24.29 \n\n1.99 \n\n1.71 \n\n0.27 \n\n7.08 \n\n0.52 \n\n0.68 \n\n-0.16 \n\n2.91 \n\n0.14 \n\n0.33 \n\n-0.19 \n\n9.39 \n\n0.58 \n\n0.96 \n\n-0.38 \n\n2006  2009 \n\n26.27 \n\n0.09 \n\n1.07 \n\n-0.98 \n\n7.60 \n\n-0.34 \n\n0.42 \n\n-0.77 \n\n3.05 \n\n-0.23 \n\n0.20 \n\n-0.43 \n\n9.97 \n\n-0.55 \n\n0.59 \n\n-1.14 \n\nAll periods \n\n  \n\n-9.47 \n\n-14.17 \n\n4.70 \n\n  \n\n-3.87 \n\n-5.75 \n\n1.88 \n\n  \n\n-2.00 \n\n-2.86 \n\n0.87 \n\n  \n\n-5.66 \n\n-8.23 \n\n2.57 \n\nNote: M(t0) is in percentage. \u0394, GR, and RD are all in percentage points. \n\nSource: Author\u2019s calculation based on Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) data. \n\nTable 2: Decomposition of Poverty Rate with Various Methods and Values of \u03b3 \n\n   \n\n   \n\n  \n\n   \n   \n\n  \n        \u2044\n\n \n\n  \n        \u2044\n\n \n\n   \n\n   \n\n    \n      \n\n    \n      \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n  \n\n   \n    \n\n    \n   \n\n1985  1988 \n\n1988  1991 \n\n1991  1994 \n\n1994  1997 \n\n1997  2000 \n\n2000  2003 \n\n2003  2006 \n\n2006  2009 \n\n-3.07 \n\n0.08 \n\n-4.21 \n\n-2.68 \n\n0.85 \n\n-2.51 \n\n1.98 \n\n0.09 \n\n-2.92 \n\n-3.19 \n\n-2.49 \n\n-8.38 \n\n0.95 \n\n-1.03 \n\n1.76 \n\n1.03 \n\n-2.91 \n\n-3.19 \n\n-2.51 \n\n-8.48 \n\n0.97 \n\n-1.03 \n\n1.75 \n\n1.05 \n\n-2.87 \n\n-3.16 \n\n-2.49 \n\n-8.45 \n\n0.97 \n\n-1.02 \n\n1.73 \n\n1.06 \n\n-2.82 \n\n-3.15 \n\n-2.49 \n\n-8.47 \n\n0.98 \n\n-1.01 \n\n1.71 \n\n1.07 \n\n-2.77 \n\n-3.14 \n\n-2.49 \n\n-8.48 \n\n0.99 \n\n-1.00 \n\n1.70 \n\n1.09 \n\n-2.73 \n\n-3.14 \n\n-2.50 \n\n-8.48 \n\n0.99 \n\n-0.99 \n\n1.69 \n\n1.11 \n\n-2.67 \n\n-3.12 \n\n-2.50 \n\n-8.46 \n\n1.00 \n\n-0.98 \n\n1.68 \n\n1.13 \n\n-2.80 \n\n-3.16 \n\n-2.49 \n\n-8.42 \n\n0.97 \n\n-1.00 \n\n1.72 \n\n1.08 \n\n-2.82 \n\n-3.15 \n\n-2.49 \n\n-8.47 \n\n0.98 \n\n-1.00 \n\n1.71 \n\n1.08 \n\n0.25 \n\n0.06 \n\n-0.01 \n\n-0.08 \n\n0.05 \n\n0.05 \n\n-0.08 \n\n0.10 \n\nNote: All the figures for poverty decomposition are in percentage points. \n\nSource: Author\u2019s calculation based on Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) data. \n\n \n\n19 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 466 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n       \n\n \n\n \n\n   Fujii \n\nTable 3 shows the results of this experiment.

Because  there  is  only  one \ncombination in this case, the maximum and mean are identical. For example, Table 3 shows \nthat  the  growth  component  under  the  linearity  assumption  between  1985  and  2009  is \ndifferent  from  that  in  the  benchmark  case  of  piecewise  linearity  assumption  by  0.22 \npercentage  points.  In  the  second  row,  we  consider  the  case  in  which  we  drop  six \nobservations.  Because  we  keep  only  one  of  the  seven  observations  strictly  between  1985 \nand  2009  in  this  case,  there  are  seven  possible  combinations  as  shown  in  the  second \ncolumn. The benchmark case corresponds to equation (10) with no observation dropped and \nhence the last row for the equation (10) column is 0 by construction.  \n\n We  see  that  generally  the  last  three  columns  perform  better  than  the  KS  and  JT  columns. \nThis  is  not  surprising  because  both  the  KS  and  JT  decompositions  rely  on  the  assumption \nthat  growth  and  redistribution  change  sequentially.  While  the  Shapley  decomposition  is \nsimply the average of these two decompositions, it is close to the benchmark case because it \ncan  approximate  the  linear  assumption  reasonably  well,  as  argued  in  Section 2.3. \nEquation (10)  is  close  to  the  benchmark  by  construction,  because  the  assumed  path  of \nchange is the same as the benchmark case except for the periods that involve the dropped \nobservations. Equation (14) is also close to the benchmark, because the underlying path of \nchanges  is  similar  to  equation (10).

Unlike the KS, JK, and RD decompositions, we can neatly decompose the \npoverty change into population shift, within-group redistribution, between-group redistribution, \nnominal  growth,  inflation,  and  methodological  change  components  for  each  group  in  the \npopulation of interest. While the Shapley decomposition also allows us to produce residual-\nfree decomposition results, it is computationally infeasible to carry out six-way decomposition \nwith regional disaggregation because the number of possible sequences of change is equal \nto the factorial of the number of components.  \n\nit  allows \n\nthat \n\nIn  Table 4,  we  report  the  results  of  six-way  decomposition  of  poverty  rate  described  in \nsection 2.6. The  last  row  is  the  sum  of the  eight  3-year  periods  and the  last  column,  which \nrepresents the change in poverty rate, is equal to the sum of all six components. There are \nthree important points to note in this table.  \n\nFirst, Table 4 shows that the nominal growth has contributed to a more than 100-percentage-\npoint  reduction  in  poverty  rate  between  1985  and  2009.  This  is  possible  because  nominal \ngrowth can eliminate poverty created by other factors such as inflation. In fact, Table 4 shows \nthat  much  of  the  poverty  reduction  by  nominal  growth  has  been  offset  by  inflation.  If  we \ndefine  the  effect  of  real  growth  as  the  combined  effects  of  nominal  growth  and  inflation \ncomponents, we see that the effect of real growth has contributed to the reduction of poverty \nby  more  than  20  percentage  points  between  1985  and  2009  in  the  Philippines.  This \noverwhelming  effect  of  real  growth  would  not  be  surprising  given  that  countries  with  higher \ngrowth have tended to reduce poverty at a faster rate. It is also worth noting that much of the \nreal-growth effect has taken place before 1997 and real growth has not contributed to poverty \nreduction since then.  \n\nSecond,  Table 4  also  shows  that  poverty  has  increased  due  to  both  within-group \nredistribution  and  between-group  redistribution  effects,  but  the  former  effect  is  much  larger \nthan  the  latter.  It  also  shows  that  their  relative  importance  has  changed  over  time.  For \nexample,  the  main  driver  of  poverty  increase  due  to  worsening  distribution  was  between-\nregion  inequality for  1988\u20131991,  but  it  was within-region  inequality for  1994\u20131997. We also \nsee  from  Table 4  that  the  between-region  inequality  has  changed  favorably  for  poverty \nreduction since 2000. We also see that the population shift did not have much impact on the \nnational poverty rate in the Philippines.   \n\nThird, the methodological change component is not negligible. Poverty has increased by as \nmuch as 8 percentage points due to this component. The interpretation of the methodological \n\n \n\n21 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 466 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n       \n\n \n\n \n\n   Fujii \n\ncomponent  is  slightly  tricky.  The  methodological  component  reflects  the  changes  in  the \nquantity  of goods  at the level  of  the  poverty  line. Therefore,  if the  standards  of  living  at  the \npoverty line go up over time (e.g., because of the inconsistency in the way poverty lines are \ndrawn),  poverty  goes  up  even  when  there  is  no  change  in  the  mean  and  distribution  of \nincome  in  the  Philippines.  Hence,  it  is  possible  that  the  methodological  change component \nreflects a spurious change due to methodological inconsistency. It is also possible, however, \nthat the poor have systematically increased consumption of goods that are getting expensive.    \n\nThe  latter  possibility,  however,  is  unlikely  to  be  true  in  the  Philippines  because  the  poor \ntypically  tend  to  shift  away  from  goods  that  are  getting  rapidly  expensive  (Fujii  2013).  The \n ) calculated by Professor Balisacan \ncomparison of the changes in consumption poverty (   \n(see  Balisacan  [2003]  and  ADB  [2009])  against  the  \u201craw\u201d  change  in  poverty  rate  (   )  and \n     )  also  suggest  that  the \nthe  one  adjusted  for  the  methodological  change  (          \nmethodological  change component  is  indeed  spurious.  As  seen in Figure 5,  the  changes  in \nour poverty measure with the adjustment for the methodological component (dashed line) are \ncloser to the changes in Balisacan\u2019s consumption poverty rate (bold line) than those without \nthe  adjustment  (solid  line).  Because  Balisacan  uses  consumption  poverty  lines  that  are \nsupposed to be comparable over time, our results indicate that the slow progress in poverty \nreduction in our poverty measure is partly because of the increases in the standards of living \nat  the  poverty  line.  Therefore,  actual  poverty  reduction  may  have  been  faster  than  what \nFigure 4 suggests, once we fix the standards of living at the poverty line.  \n\nFigure 5: Comparison with Balisacan\u2019s Estimate of Consumption Poverty \n\n \n\nSources: Author\u2019s calculation based on  Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) data; Balisacan (2003); ADB \n(2009). \n\nAs  discussed  in  section 2.6,  it  is  possible  to  decompose  the  poverty  change  into  six \ncomponents  for  each  region  so  that  we  can  pin  down  the  important  sources  of  poverty \nchange.  Table 5  shows  the  regional  decomposition  results  for  poverty  rate  for  1985\u20132009, \nwhich are calculated as the sum of the decomposition results for the eight 3-year periods. By \nconstruction,  the  last  row  is  the  same  as  that  in  Table 4.  The  last  column  of  Table 5  is  the \nsum  of  all  six  components,  which  can  be  interpreted  as  each  region\u2019s  contribution  to  the \nchange in the national poverty rate. Therefore, most regions have made some contribution to \nthe  national  poverty  reduction,  with  Region VI  and  Region VII  making  particularly  large \ncontributions.14 However, some other regions, such as ARMM, have negated some of these \n\n                                                \n14\n\n See Table A1 in the Appendix for a description of the regions. \n\n \n\n22 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 466 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n       \n\n \n\n \n\n   Fujii \n\nreductions. This observation is still true when we adjust for the MC component. It should also \nbe  noted  that  everything  else  being  equal,  each  component  tends  to  be  larger  in  absolute \nvalue when the region is large. However, our results are not driven by the size of the regions, \nbecause Region VI, Region VII, and ARMM are not particularly large regions.  \n\nTable 5  also  shows  that  there  is  substantial  heterogeneity  in  the  way  each  region  has \ncontributed  to  poverty  change  in  the  Philippines.  Although  nominal  growth  and  inflation  are \nthe  largest  components  in  absolute  value,  the  impact  of  real  growth  (NG+IF)  on  national \npoverty  varies  quite  substantially,  ranging  from  -2.58  in  Region VI  to  -0.07  in  ARMM.  The \nmagnitude  of  within-group  and  between-group  inequality  also  varies  over  regions.  We  find \nthat the within-group redistribution component has contributed to an increase in the poverty \nrate  in  most  regions,  whereas  the  impact  of  the  between-group  redistribution  component  is \nquite  diverse.  While  we  only  discussed  the  six-way  decomposition  results  for  the  poverty \nrate, the results for the poverty gap, poverty severity, and Watts measure, which are reported \nin Appendix D, are qualitatively similar.  \n\nTable 5: Six-Way Decomposition of P0 by Region \n\nRegion \n\nPS \n\nWR \n\nBR \n\nNG \n\nIF \n\nMC \n\n    \n\nNCR \n\nCAR \n\nRegion I \n\nRegion II \n\nRegion III \n\nRegion IV-A \n\nRegion IV-B \n\nRegion V \n\nRegion VI \n\nRegion VII \n\nRegion VIII \n\nRegion IX \n\nRegion X \n\nRegion XI \n\nRegion XII \n\nARMM \n\nCaraga \n\nPhilippines \n\n-0.06 \n\n-0.06 \n\n-0.19 \n\n-0.17 \n\n0.17 \n\n0.50 \n\n0.12 \n\n-0.27 \n\n-0.14 \n\n0.16 \n\n-0.22 \n\n-0.07 \n\n-0.10 \n\n-0.07 \n\n0.30 \n\n-0.09 \n\n-0.11 \n\n-0.28 \n\n-0.02 \n\n0.21 \n\n0.22 \n\n0.36 \n\n-0.27 \n\n0.40 \n\n-0.12 \n\n0.68 \n\n0.32 \n\n0.22 \n\n0.89 \n\n0.24 \n\n0.26 \n\n0.29 \n\n0.58 \n\n-0.34 \n\n0.53 \n\n4.46 \n\n-0.53 \n\n0.14 \n\n0.29 \n\n-0.04 \n\n0.66 \n\n-0.42 \n\n0.23 \n\n-0.18 \n\n-0.22 \n\n-0.76 \n\n-0.68 \n\n0.28 \n\n0.22 \n\n0.25 \n\n0.07 \n\n1.33 \n\n0.05 \n\n-10.82 \n\n-6.15 \n\n-1.75 \n\n-6.93 \n\n-4.85 \n\n-9.98 \n\n-8.84 \n\n-3.46 \n\n-9.01 \n\n-8.31 \n\n-6.53 \n\n-4.03 \n\n-5.15 \n\n-5.62 \n\n-4.73 \n\n-5.27 \n\n-3.66 \n\n5.21 \n\n1.32 \n\n5.23 \n\n3.73 \n\n7.69 \n\n7.06 \n\n2.59 \n\n7.22 \n\n8.23 \n\n6.79 \n\n5.12 \n\n3.09 \n\n3.94 \n\n4.17 \n\n3.23 \n\n5.20 \n\n2.92 \n\n0.37 \n\n0.20 \n\n0.84 \n\n0.32 \n\n1.20 \n\n0.66 \n\n0.60 \n\n0.45 \n\n0.64 \n\n0.19 \n\n0.53 \n\n0.23 \n\n0.45 \n\n0.61 \n\n0.79 \n\n-0.27 \n\n0.24 \n\n8.05 \n\n-1.17 \n\n0.05 \n\n-0.55 \n\n-0.66 \n\n-0.53 \n\n-0.64 \n\n-0.04 \n\n-1.12 \n\n-1.98 \n\n-1.71 \n\n-0.89 \n\n-0.26 \n\n-0.39 \n\n-0.36 \n\n0.23 \n\n0.57 \n\n-0.03 \n\n-9.45 \n\n0.67 \n\n-105.09 \n\n82.73 \n\nNote: All the figures for poverty decomposition are expressed in percentage points. \n\nSource: Author\u2019s calculation based on Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) data. \n\n5.  DISCUSSION \n\nIn  this  paper,  we  have  proposed  a  method  of  dynamic  poverty  decomposition  that  is \nsubperiod-additive  and  time-reversion  consistent.  Our  decomposition  analysis  consistently \nintegrates the conventional dynamic poverty decomposition such as Datt and Ravallion (1992) \nand  group-based  decomposition  such  as  Ravallion  and  Huppi  (1991).  Our  method  has  an \nadditional  advantage  in  that  there  are  no  residual  or  interaction  terms.  While  our  method \nrequires  the  specification  of  the  path  of  change,  we  have  provided  a  practical  way  to \nimplement the decomposition under a set of reasonable assumptions.  \n\n23 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 466 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n       \n\n \n\n \n\n   Fujii \n\nIn  our  empirical  application  to  the  Philippines,  we  considered  a  six-way  decomposition  in \nwhich  the  national  poverty  change  is  decomposed  into  population  shift,  within-group \nredistribution,  between-group  redistribution,  nominal  growth,  inflation,  and  methodological \nchange components for each of the 17 regions in the Philippines.  \n\nWe find that nominal growth and inflation are by far the largest components in absolute value \nin each region and that the impacts of other components are heterogeneous, which indicates \nthat the appropriate poverty reduction policies may vary from region to region. For example, \nthe  results  reported  in  Table 5  suggest  that  some  regions,  such  as  ARMM,  would  require \ngrowth-enhancing  policies  to  reduce  poverty  effectively,  whereas  other  regions,  such  as \nRegion VIII, may need policies to improve the income distribution within the region. We also \nfind  that  poverty  reduction  in  the  Philippines  has  been  slowed  substantially  by  worsening \ninequality  for  the  periods  1988\u20131991  and  1994\u20131997.  For  other  periods,  the  apparent  slow \nprogress  in  poverty  reduction  was  mostly  because  of  the  lack  of  real  economic  growth  but \nalso partly because of the methodological change.    \n\nIn this study, we chose regions as a unit of the group for empirical illustration, because the \nPhilippines  is  spatially  heterogeneous  in  terms  of  consumption  patterns,  growth  rate,  and \ninflation rate. However, our analysis can also be applied to a number of other issues by using \nother  variables  as  a  unit  of  group,  such  as  the  ethnic  groups,  the  education  of  household \nhead, the employment status or sector of the household head, and the household size. Using \nthese variables, we can expand the scope of the standard poverty profile approach. That is, \ninstead  of  simply  comparing  the  poverty  rate,  poverty  gap,  and  poverty  severity  across \ndifferent groups for various years, as is done in the standard poverty profile approach, using \nour method, we can decompose the change in national poverty into various components for \neach  group  in  the  population.  Hence,  our  decomposition  method  can  complement  and \nenhance the usefulness of the poverty profile approach.    \n\nWhile we chose to apply our method to a developing country, it is also applicable to poverty \nanalysis in developed countries, where poverty lines are typically drawn separately for each \nhousehold category and defined as a fraction of mean or median income. Therefore, even if \neveryone\u2019s  income  is  rising,  poverty  may  still  increase  if  the  income  at  the  center  of  the \ndistribution  rises  faster  than  incomes  in  the  lower  tail  of  the  distribution.  Using  our  method \n(with a slight modification), it is possible to separate the effects of increasing income at the \nbottom and middle on poverty.    \n\nIt should also be noted that our method does not necessarily require all the components of \ninterest  to  independently  vary  over  time.  For  example,  if  inequality  determines  growth \nthrough the process of human and physical capital accumulation (e.g., Galor and Moav 2004) \nwhile     is  held  constant,  we  would  have  the  following  relationship  instead  of,  say, \nequation (8)  in  Assumption 8:    \u0303( )   \u2044    ( \u0303( \u0303   ))  for  some  function   ( )  with  its  definite \nto        being  \u0303     \u0303 .  In  a  case  like  this,  poverty  change  is  completely \nintegral  from        \ndetermined  by  the  change  in  income  distribution.  However,  it  is  still  possible  to  identify  the \ngrowth and redistribution components in our approach, because Proposition 1 still holds and \nthus  the  growth  component  can  be  computed  by  simply  replacing   \u0303( )   \u2044  by  ( \u0303( \u0303   )) in \nequation (6). Similarly, it is also possible to consider the effects of demographic dividend by \nexplicitly  modeling  the  relationship  between  demographic  characteristics  of  the  population \nand economic growth.  \n\nAs  with  other  decomposition  methods,  our  decomposition  is  descriptive  and  essentially  an \naccounting  exercise.  Therefore,  it  does  not  in  general  describe  the  causal  relationship \nbetween poverty  and the  components  of  interest.  However,  the  discussion  in the  preceding \nparagraph  means  that  we  can  potentially  make  a  causal  inference  if  the  underlying \nrelationship between components is known.15 Even when no such relationship is known, our \n\n                                                \n15 Note, though, that we are still agnostic about the driving force of the change in  \u0303( \u0303   ). \n\n \n\n24 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 466 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n       \n\n \n\n \n\n   Fujii \n\ndecomposition still provides researchers and policy makers with information that is useful for \nunderstanding the source of poverty change and formulating poverty reduction policies. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n25 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 466 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n       \n\n \n\n \n\n   Fujii \n\nREFERENCES \n\nAccess.

Details of Data and Poverty Measurement \n\nIn the official methodology, the poverty lines are set at the level where one can satisfy some \nbasic nutritional requirements and meet some non-food needs. The methodology to calculate \nthe  poverty  line,  however,  has  been  revised  three  times:  in  1992,  2003,  and  2011.1 The \nofficial poverty statistics based on the 1992 and 2003 revisions are available for 1985\u20132000 \nand  2000\u20132006,  respectively.  Those  based  on  the  2011  revision  are  currently  available  for \n1991, 2003, 2006, and 2009.  \n\nWe  adopt  the  2011  revision  with  some  modifications.  Because  poverty  lines  based  on  the \n1992 revision are available only at the regional level, we use the regional (and not provincial) \npoverty line for all years. Further, we recalculate the aggregate income for all rounds of  the \nFamily Income and Expenditure Survey  (FIES) because there was a minor inconsistency in \nthe definition of incomes. As a result, the poverty statistics used in our study are not exactly \nthe  same  as  the  official  statistics.  However,  these  modifications  have  little  impact  on  the \nresulting poverty statistics.  \n\nTo obtain the poverty lines for earlier years, we first calculate the rate of change in poverty \nline  between  two  contiguous  survey  rounds  for  each  region.  When  more  than  one  rate  is \navailable  for  a  given  period,  we  use  the  harmonic  mean  for  that  period.  Because  some \nregions did not exist in earlier years, we instead use the rate for the island group to which the \nregion  belongs.  Using  these  rules,  we  extrapolate  poverty  lines  for  earlier  years,  which  are \npresented in Table A1.  \n\nTo  carry  out  the  six-way  decomposition,  we  need  to  define  the  set  of  goods  used  in  the \ncalculation  of  poverty  lines.  Based  on  the  availability  of  data,  we  set  J  =  10  and  use  the \nfollowing  10  goods:  (i) food,  (ii) alcohol  and  tobacco,  (iii) clothing  and  footwear,  (iv) housing \nand  utility, \n(vi) medical  care, \n(vii) transportation and communication, (viii) recreation, (ix) education, and (x) miscellaneous \ngoods and services. The consumption expenditure data in FIES are aggregated up to these \n10 goods. The consumer price index (CPI) data are also aggregated up to this level using the \nCPI weights.  \n\n(v) furniture,  household  equipment,  and  operation, \n\nFor all the years except 2009, the reference year for the CPI data is year 2000. Because we \ncould only obtain base-2006 CPI data for 2009, we simply multiply base-2000 CPI figures for \n2006 by base-2006 CPI figures for 2009 to obtain an estimate of base-2000 CPI figures for \n2009. For years before 1988, the CPI has only six types of goods. For example, we have the \nCPI data for \u201cfood, alcohol, and tobacco,\u201d without the breakdown for \u201cfood\u201d and \u201calcohol and \ntobacco.\u201d Therefore, we assume that the CPI change is the same for these two categories. \nWe apply a similar rule for other aggregate categories, too.  \n\n  of good   in region   is taken from the annual average CPI for good   in region \nThe price   \n . Because the bundles of goods underlying the poverty lines are not available, we first take \nthe average expenditure share for those households within 10% of the poverty line in region \n , we obtain \n  for each survey year. Then, multiplying it by the poverty line and dividing it by   \nthe quantity   \n\n  of good   in region   at the poverty line for each survey year.  \n\n                                                \n1\n See Asian Development Bank (2005) and National Statistical Coordination Board (2011) for the details of these \n\nchanges. \n\n \n\n \n\n28 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 466 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n       \n\n \n\n \n\n   Fujii \n\nTable A1: Income Poverty Lines in the Philippines Used for This Study \n\nRegion \n\nDescription of Region \n\n1985  1988  1991  1994  1997  2000  2003  2006  2009 \n\nNCR \n\nCAR \n\nNational Capital Region \n\n3,360  4,881  6,892  8,335  10,613  12,873  13,704  16,487  19,802 \n\nCordillera Administrative Region  2,669  3,456  5,629  7,333  8,672  10,356  10,841  12,976  16,122 \n\nRegion I \n\nIlocos Region \n\n2,999  3,920  6,404  7,962  9,514  11,536  11,835  14,350  17,768 \n\nRegion II \n\nCagayan Valley \n\n2,765  3,667  5,641  6,668  7,922  9,809  10,250  12,212  15,306 \n\nRegion III \n\nCentral Luzon \n\n3,126  4,207  6,559  7,830  9,501  11,846  12,756  15,374  18,981 \n\nRegion IV-A  CALARARZON \n\n3,002  3,823  6,389  7,546  9,852  11,798  12,180  14,284  17,779 \n\nRegion IV-B  MIMAROPA \n\nRegion V \n\nBicol Region \n\n2,431  3,096  5,174  6,110  7,978  9,554  10,397  12,610  15,769 \n\n2,928  3,533  5,444  7,093  8,849  10,640  11,559  13,645  17,146 \n\nRegion VI  Western Visayas \n\n2,876  3,399  5,010  6,414  8,263  9,653  9,799  12,432  16,036 \n\nRegion VII  Central Visayas \n\n3,061  3,437  5,172  5,950  8,073  10,133  11,488  14,468  17,848 \n\nRegion VIII  Eastern Visayas \n\n2,650  3,081  4,147  5,201  7,043  8,420  9,600  11,885  15,910 \n\nRegion IX \n\nZamboanga Peninsula \n\n2,774  2,988  5,003  5,573  7,667  8,736  9,647  11,810  15,160 \n\nRegion X \n\nNorthern Mindanao \n\n2,770  3,533  5,026  6,201  8,156  9,197  10,200  12,987  16,568 \n\nRegion XI  Davao Region \n\n2,965  3,966  5,322  6,670  8,542  9,907  10,731  13,469  17,040 \n\nRegion XII  SOCCSKSARGEN \n\n2,850  3,218  5,681  6,961  8,628  9,657  10,368  12,530  15,762 \n\nCaraga \n\nARMM \n\nCaraga Region \nAutonomous Region in Muslim \nMindanao \n\n2,938  3,585  5,468  6,637  8,595  10,039  10,478  12,935  16,858 \n\n2,566  3,130  4,775  5,697  7,136  8,810  9,693  12,358  16,334 \n\nNote: Poverty lines are expressed as the annual household income per capita in Philippine pesos.  \n\nSource:  Author\u2019s  calculation  based  on  poverty  lines  published  in  National  Statistics  Office  (NSO)  webpages  and \npublications. \n\nB.

Our  method  remedies \nthe  shortcomings  of  existing  methods  and  has  some  desirable  properties  such  as  time-\nreversion consistency and subperiod additivity. It integrates the existing methods of growth-\nredistribution  decomposition  and  sector-based  decomposition,  because  it  allows  us  to \ndecompose the change in poverty into growth and redistribution components for each group \n(e.g., regions or sectors) in the economy. We extend our method to include six components \nand provide an empirical application to the Philippines for the period 1985\u20132009. \n \nJEL Classification: I32, O10 \n", " \n", " \n"]}
