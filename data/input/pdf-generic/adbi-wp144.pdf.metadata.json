INTRODUCTION \n\nKawai and Wignaraja \n\nThe  recent  advent  of  free  trade  agreements  (FTAs)  will  likely  have  a  marked  impact  on \nAsia\u2019s trade policy and its cherished status as the global factory. This paper deals with the \nspread  of  FTAs  in  economically  important  Asia  since  2000,  including  the  current  FTA \nlandscape, challenges FTAs pose for business and public policy, and what might be done to \nmake Asian FTAs more multilateral friendly.  \n\nThree recent and interrelated developments provide the context for this chapter:  \n\nFirst,  Asia\u2019s  advanced  production  networks,  which  underlie  its  spectacular  global  export \nsuccess  over  the  past  several  decades,  have  deepened  regionally  (Kimura  2006;  Asian \nDevelopment Bank [ADB] 2008). Production networks have been broken into smaller steps, \nwith  each  step  in  the  most  cost-effective  location,  thereby  further  improving  efficiency. \nFalling regional trade barriers and logistics costs, along with technological progress, underlie \nthis  trend.  Intraregional  trade  in  Asia  has  increased  significantly,  particularly  in  parts  and \ncomponents, and this trend may continue with further regional liberalization via FTAs. \n\nSecond, East Asia\u2014a relative latecomer to using FTAs as a trade policy instrument\u2014is now \nat the forefront of global FTA activity with 54 concluded FTAs. The Association of Southeast \nAsian  Nations  (ASEAN)  is  emerging  as  the  hub  for  Asia\u2019s  FTAs,  with  other  major  Asian \neconomies  joining  the  FTA  bandwagon.  Policy  support  for  the  deeper  integration  of \nproduction networks, regional integration efforts in other major markets, and the 1997\u20131998 \nAsian financial crisis have spurred the growth of Asian FTAs (Urata 2004; Kawai 2005). With \nmany more FTAs currently under negotiation, there is little sign of a diminishing appetite for \nFTAs in Asia. \n\nThird,  there  is  emerging  literature  on  the  economic  effects  of  Asian  FTAs.  Issues  and \nconcerns  highlighted  in  the  new  literature  include  little  use  of  FTA  preferences,  a  \"noodle \nbowl\"  problem  of  criss-crossing  agreements  that  potentially  distort  trade  toward  bilateral \nchannels,  excessive  exclusions  and  special  treatment  in  FTAs,  and  the  possibility  that  the \nmultilateral  trading  system  may  be  progressively  eroded  (Baldwin  2006;  Bhagwati  2008). \nFTAs  are  a  relatively  new  phenomenon  in  Asia  and  a  dearth  of  empirical  evidence, \nparticularly with respect to patterns of Asian FTAs and business impacts, has made it difficult \nto verify the validity of these concerns. With the availability of new data, the time is ripe for \nan evidence-based assessment of Asian FTAs.  \n\nAmid the economic downturn following the global financial crisis and the stalled World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) Doha negotiations, regionalism and FTAs in Asia are likely to persist as \na means to promote liberalization. Liberalizing trade regionally, as opposed to globally, may \nbe  easier  to  achieve  because  fewer  parties  are  involved.  Moreover,  regional  agreements \nmay be able to extend further in key policy areas. Accordingly, business will need to learn to \nexport  more  effectively  under  a  regional  trade  regime  anchored  on  FTAs.  The  focus  for \npolicymakers  is  how  best  to  minimize  the  costs  of  Asian  FTAs  (e.g.,  transactions  and \nadministrative  costs)  while  maximizing  their  benefits  (e.g.,  preferential  tariffs,  better  market \naccess, and new business opportunities.)  \n\nAdopting a pragmatic perspective, this paper examines trends and challenges in Asian FTAs \nwith  a  view  to  making  suggestions.  Section  II  summarizes  Asia's  emergence  as  the  global \nfactory  through  outward-oriented  development  strategies  and  highlights  the  region's  recent \nemphasis on FTAs. It charts major trends in Asian FTAs since 2000, including growth, hubs \nand  spokes,  cross-regional  orientation,  and  trade  coverage.  Section  III  analyses  five  key \nchallenges posed by Asian FTAs: (i) improving firm-level use of FTAs, (ii) tackling the Asian \n\u201cnoodle  bowl\u201d  problem,  (iii)  promoting  comprehensive  coverage  of  agricultural  trade,  (iv) \nincreasing  \u201cWTO-plus\u201d  elements,  and  (v)  forming  a  region-wide  FTA.  New  evidence  from \nanalysis of FTAs, firm surveys, and computable general equilibrium (CGE) models is used to \naddress  these  challenges.  In  response  to  increasing  interest  in  forming  a  region-wide \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 144 \n \n\nKawai and Wignaraja \n\nagreement, Section IV explores political economy issues as they relate to FTA consolidation \nin  East  Asia  and  its  potential  connection  with  North  America  and  Europe.  In  conclusion, \nSection  V  advocates  strengthening  the  support  system  for  regional  production  networks, \nforging comprehensive WTO-plus agreements, and encouraging an East Asia-wide FTA. A \nbottom-up approach to a WTO Doha Round Agreement emerges from the analysis.  \n\nFor  the  purposes  of  this  paper,  the  term  \u201cAsia\u201d  is  narrowly  used  to  describe  the  16 \neconomies  that  make  up  \u201cintegrating  Asia,\u201d  while  the  term  \u201cdeveloping  Asia\u201d  excludes \nJapan.1 \n\n2.  TRENDS IN ASIAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS \n\n2.1  Emergence of the Global Factory \n\nThe  story  of  developing  Asia\u2019s  spectacular  rise  from  a  poor  underdeveloped  agricultural \nbackwater to become the global factory over a 50-year period is regarded as an economic \nmiracle (Stiglitz 1996). In the 1960s, developing Asian economies lacked natural resources \nand  had  high  levels  of  poverty.  There  seemed  to  be  little  prospect  of  economic \nadvancement. Nonetheless, Asian economies had ample supplies of inexpensive, productive \nmanpower.  They  were  also  geographically  close  to  an  expanding  high-income  Japan,  with \nefficient  multinational  corporations  (MNCs)  seeking  to  relocate  production  to  less  costly \nlocations in East Asia. Multilateralism through the WTO framework and its predecessor, the \nGeneral  Agreement  on  Trade  and  Tariffs  (GATT),  and  open  regionalism\u2014supported  by \n(APEC), \nliberalization\u2014centered  on  Asia\u2013Pacific  Economic  Cooperation \nunilateral \nunderpinned  Asia\u2019s  approach  to  international  trade  policy  for  several  decades.  FTAs  were \nabsent  both  internationally  and  in  Asia.  International  trade  policy  at  the  national  level  was \nanchored by outward-oriented development strategies, high domestic savings rates, creation \nof strong infrastructure, and investment in human capital. A booming world economy hungry \nfor labor-intensive imports from Asia, falling tariffs in developed country markets, inflows of \ntrade-related  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI),  and  generous  foreign  aid  flows  also  favored \noutward-oriented growth in Asia.  \n\nA  long  period  of  market-driven  expansion  of  trade  and  FDI  followed,  during  which  Asia \nincreasingly became the global factory. Through strategies of innovation and learning, Asian \nfirms  acquired  the  requisite  technological  capabilities  to  either  compete  internationally  or \nbecome suppliers to MNCs (Hobday 1995; Mathews and Cho 2000; Wignaraja 2008). This \ninvolved  developing  production  engineering  skills  to  use  imported  technologies  efficiently \nand  successfully  plugging  into  the  advanced  global  production  networks  formed  by  MNCs \nand local suppliers. As systematic innovation and learning took place at the firm level, a shift \nfrom  labor-intensive  exports  (e.g.,  textiles,  garments,  and  footwear)  to  more  technology-\nintensive  exports  (e.g.,  chemicals,  ships,  electronics,  and  automobiles)  occurred  in  Asia. \nSome  Asian  firms  built  deep  innovative  capabilities  based  on  investments  in  research  and \ndevelopment,  emerging  as  leading  firms  in  production  networks  and  supply  chains.  Rising \neconomic prosperity in Asia followed in the wake of rapid industrialization. As a result, three \nof  the  world's  richest  economies  are  now  in  Asia:  Japan,  Republic  of  Korea  (hereafter \nKorea), and Singapore. \n\nIn  addition,  intraregional  concentration  of  trade  and  FDI  activities  rose  as  production \nnetworks  involving  Asian  firms  deepened  regionally  (Kimura  2006).  Rising  factor  costs  in \ncore  production  locations  were  a  prime  driver.  Falling  regional  trade  barriers  and  logistics \ncosts, as well as technological progress, spurred the decentralization of production networks \n                                                 \n1  Integrating Asia includes Brunei Darussalam; Cambodia; People\u2019s Republic of China; Hong Kong, China; India; \nIndonesia;  Japan;  Republic  of  Korea;  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic;  Malaysia;  Myanmar;  Philippines; \nSingapore;  Taipei,China;  Thailand;  and  Viet  Nam.  See  Appendix  Table  1  for  basic  economic  statistics  of  the \neconomies in Integrating Asia. \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 144 \n \n\nKawai and Wignaraja \n\nto  the  most  cost-effective  locations.  Accordingly,  trade  within  Asia  increased  significantly \nfrom  37%  of  total  trade  to  54%  between  1980  and  2007,  led  by  trade  in  parts  and \ncomponents  (ADB  2008).  Toward  the  turn  of  the  20th  century,  this  simple  story  of  outward \norientation  and  export  success  was  punctuated  by  a  change  in  the  nature  of  Asia\u2019s \ninternational trade policy toward FTAs.  \n\n2.2  Growth of FTAs \n\nAlongside multilateralism, Asia began emphasizing FTAs as a trade policy instrument in the \nlate 1990s and the region is today at the forefront of world FTA activity (Feridhanusetyawan \n2005;  Fiorentino,  Crawford,  and  Toqueboeuf  2009).  Appendix  Table  2  provides  data  from \nthe ADB FTA Database on the number of concluded FTAs in Asia between 2000 and 2009 \n(as of June 2009). The number of concluded FTAs in Asia as a group increased from only 3 \nto 54 during that time. Of these, 40 FTAs are currently in effect. The proliferation of FTAs in \nAsia  is  likely  to  be  sustained:  another  78  are  either  under  negotiation  or  proposed.  Asia  is \nahead of the Americas in FTAs per country\u2014on average Asia has 3.4 concluded FTAs per \ncountry  compared  with  2.2  for  the  Americas.2  On  the  whole,  Asia  seems  to  be  opting  for \nbilateral  agreements  rather \nthan  more  complex  plurilateral  ones  because  bilateral \nagreements  may  be  easier  to  negotiate.  Bilateral  FTAs  comprise  74%  of  the  concluded \nFTAs, with plurilateral FTAs comprising the remainder. \n\nFour main factors underlie the recent spread of FTA initiatives in Asia: (i) deepening market-\ndriven economic integration in Asia, (ii) European and North American economic integration, \n(iii)  the  1997\u20131998  Asian  financial  crisis,  and  (iv)  slow  progress  in  the  WTO  Doha \nnegotiations.3 \n\nFirst  among  these  is  market-driven  economic  integration  through  trade,  FDI,  and  the \nformation  of  East  Asian  production  networks  and  supply  chains.  Market-driven  economic \nintegration has begun to require further liberalization of trade and FDI and harmonization of \npolicies,  rules,  and  standards  governing  trade  and  FDI.  East  Asia\u2019s  policymakers  are \nincreasingly of the view that FTAs, if given wide scope, can support expanding trade and FDI \nactivities  through  further  elimination  of  cross-border  impediments,  facilitation  of  trade  and \nFDI,  and  other  such  harmonization  efforts.  Thus,  FTAs  can  be  regarded  as  part  of  a \nsupporting  policy  framework  for  deepening  production  networks  and  supply  chains  formed \nby global MNCs and emerging Asian firms. \n\nSecond,  European  and  North  American  economic  regionalism\u2014including  European  Union \n(EU)  expansion  into  central  and  eastern  Europe,  a  monetary  union  in  the  eurozone,  the \nsuccess of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and incipient moves toward \na Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA)\u2014has motivated East Asian FTAs. Governments \nfear  that  the  two  giant  trading  blocs  of  Europe  and  North  America  might  dominate  rule-\nsetting  in  the  global  trading  system,  thereby  marginalizing  Asia.  Increasingly,  policymakers \nhave  realized  the  need  for  stepping  up  the  pace  of  integration  to  improve  international \ncompetitiveness by exploiting economies of scale and strengthening their bargaining power \nthrough a collective voice on global trade issues. FTAs can help insure against the periodic \ndifficulties  of  multilateral  trade  liberalization,  such  as  the  recent  slow  progress  in  the  WTO \nDoha negotiations and a perceived loss of steam in the APEC process.  \n\nThird, the 1997\u20131998 Asian financial crisis made it clear that East Asian economies needed \nto work together in the area of trade and investment in order to sustain growth and stability \nby addressing common challenges. This need has not yet been fully met by either regional \ninitiatives  to  strengthen  the  international  economic  system  or  by  national  efforts  to \n\n                                                 \n2   According  to  the  Organization  of  American  States,  its  34  members  (including  the  US  and  Canada)  had  75 \nconcluded FTAs in early December 2008 (www.sice.oas.org). This compares with 16 Asian countries with 54 \nconcluded FTAs.  \n\n3   More complete explanations can be found in Kawai (2005 and 2007) and ADB (2008).  \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 144 \n \n\nKawai and Wignaraja \n\nstrengthen  individual  economies\u2019  fundamentals,  both  of  which  will  take  time  to  bear  fruit. \nWith  the  proliferation  of  FTA  initiatives  in  the  region,  a  number  of  countries  have  begun  to \njump on the bandwagon of these initiatives out of fear of exclusion. \n\nFourth, slow progress in the WTO Doha negotiations encouraged countries to consider FTAs \nas  an  alternative.  Hailed  as  a  development  round  to  promote  trade-led  growth  in  poor \ncountries,  the  WTO  Doha  Development  Round  began  in  November  2001.  The  talks  have \nlargely  focused  on  liberalization  in  two  key  areas:  agriculture  and  non-agricultural  market \naccess.  In  essence,  developed  countries  were  being  asked  to  accelerate  the  pace  and \nscope of reductions in agricultural tariffs and subsidies, and developing countries were being \nasked  to  do  the  same  with  regard  to  tariffs  for  industrial  goods.  Seven  years  of  formal \nnegotiations  eventually  stalled  in  mid-2008  over  concerns  in  developing  countries  about \nsafeguard  measures  to  protect  poor  farmers  from  rising  food  and  oil  prices.  However, \ndiscussions  have  continued  behind  the  scenes.  As  prospects  for  an  early  deal  diminished \nover  time,  pro-business  Asian  countries  emphasized  bilateral  and  plurilateral  FTAs  for  the \ncontinued  liberalization  of  trade  in  goods  and  services,  as  well  as  the  adoption  of  the \ninvestment,  government  procurement,  and \nSingapore \ncompetition policy), which are currently beyond the scope of the WTO.  \n\nissues  (i.e., \n\nfacilitation, \n\ntrade \n\n2.3  FTA Hubs and Spokes \n\nFTA  activity  in  Asia  over  the  last  decade  has  given  rise  to  a  classic  hub  and  spoke \narrangement  (Hufbauer  and  Schott  2009).  As  Figure  1  shows,  the  region's  five  largest \neconomies have become key hubs of FTA activity, while smaller neighbors have emerged as \nspokes.  The  number  of  concluded  FTAs  includes  Singapore  (18),  Japan  (11),  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC)  (10),  India  (9),  and  Korea  (6),  with  many  more  FTAs  under \nnegotiation. It is noteworthy that ASEAN\u2014with one of the oldest trade agreements in Asia\u2014\nis  emerging  as  a  major  regional  hub  linking  ASEAN  members  with  the  region\u2019s  larger \neconomies. Having enacted FTAs with PRC, Japan, and Korea, ASEAN recently concluded \nnegotiations  on  bilateral  agreements  with  India  and  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  and  is \nconsidering negotiating an FTA with the EU. The development of FTA hubs and spokes in \nAsia can be related to several factors, including economic size, per capita income, levels of \nprotection, economic geography, and the production network strategies of MNCs.  \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 144 \n \n\nKawai and Wignaraja \n\nFigure 1: Growth of Concluded FTAs in Integrating Asia \n(Number of FTAs by Country) \n\n2000\n\n2009\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nC\nR\nP\n\ni\n\ne\nn\nu\nr\nB\n\nl\n\nm\na\na\ns\ns\nu\nr\na\nD\n\ni\n\na\nd\no\nb\nm\na\nC\n\ni\n\na\nd\nn\n\nI\n\nn\na\np\na\nJ\n\ni\n\na\ns\ne\nn\no\nd\nn\n\nI\n\nR\nD\nP\no\na\nL\n\n \n\ni\n\na\ns\ny\na\na\nM\n\nl\n\nr\na\nm\nn\na\ny\nM\n\ns\ne\nn\np\np\n\ni\n\ni\nl\ni\n\nh\nP\n\ne\nr\no\np\na\ng\nn\nS\n\ni\n\nd\nn\na\n\nl\ni\n\na\nh\nT\n\nm\na\nN\n\n \nt\n\ni\n\ne\nV\n\ni\n\na\nn\nh\nC\n\n,\ni\n\ne\np\na\nT\n\ni\n\na\nn\n\ni\n\nh\nC\n\n \n,\n\ng\nn\no\nK\ng\nn\no\nH\n\n \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank; FTA = free trade agreement; Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; PRC = \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. \n\nNote: FTAs in Integrating Asia covers all FTAs with at least one integrating Asia member country.   \n\nSource: ADB\u2019s Asia Regional Integration Center (ARIC) FTA Database (www.aric.adb.org), data as of June 2009. \n\nf\n\no\n\n \n.\n\np\ne\nR\n\n \n,\n\na\ne\nr\no\nK\n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 144 \n \n\nKawai and Wignaraja \n\nSingapore is by far the most active Asian economy in terms of the number and geographic \ncoverage  of  FTAs.  With  its strategic  location,  the  region's most  open  economy,  and  world-\nclass infrastructure and logistics, the country is the regional headquarters for many leading \nMNCs. Singapore is seeking access to new overseas markets, particularly for services and \ninvestments.  \n\nThe  country  is  a  founding  member  of  the  ASEAN  Free  Trade  Area  (AFTA)  and  has \nimplemented  or  concluded  agreements  with  the  largest  Asian  economies\u2014PRC,  India, \nJapan,  and  Korea\u2014as  well  as  economies  outside  the  region,  including  the  United  States \n(US) and Australia. The US\u2013Singapore FTA, which has been in effect since 2004, was the \nfirst  such  agreement  made  by  the  US  in  Asia  and  is  reputed  to  be  a  model  agreement  in \nterms of scope.  \n\nAs a supporter of multilateralism, Japan was a latecomer to FTAs (Urata 2004). The region's \nfirst  developed  economy  has  the  strongest  base  of  giant  MNCs  involved  in  production \nnetworks  and  supply  chains  throughout  Asia.  One  motivation  for  Japan's  engagement  in \nFTAs  is  to  provide  a  market-friendly  and  predictable  regional  business  environment  for  its \nMNCs.  Japan  has  rapidly  implemented  bilateral  economic  partnership  agreements  (EPAs) \nwith  nine  countries4  and  an  agreement  with  ASEAN,  and  is  negotiating  agreements  with \nAustralia, India, and Korea.  \n\nThe  two  Asian  giant  economies,  the  PRC  and  India,  are  forming  FTAs  to  ensure  market \naccess  for  goods  and  expand  regional  coverage  for  outward  investment.  To  this  end,  the \nPRC implemented separate FTAs on goods and services with ASEAN and is now finalizing \nits  negotiations  on  an  investment  agreement.  The  PRC  has  also  forged  bilateral \ncomprehensive  economic  partnership  agreements  (CEPAs)  with  Hong  Kong,  China  and \nMacau  Special  Administrative  Region  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China;  FTAs  with  Chile \nand Pakistan; and is a member of the Asia\u2013Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA). In 2008, the \nPRC concluded FTAs with Singapore and New Zealand. India is a member of APTA and has \na  comprehensive  agreement  with  Singapore.  It  also  has  agreements  with  its  South  Asian \nneighbors.  \n\nKorea has agreements with members of APTA and ASEAN, and Singapore within East Asia; \nand  with  Chile  and  the  European  Free  Trade  Area  (EFTA)  countries  outside  East  Asia.  It \nalso signed an agreement with Asia\u2019s largest trading partner, the US, in June 2007.  \n\nWith some exceptions, the region\u2019s poorer economies\u2014Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic (Lao PDR), Viet Nam, Philippines, and Indonesia\u2014have tended to rely on ASEAN \nfor concluding FTAs with the region\u2019s larger economies. This may reflect weak institutional \ncapacity,  lack  of  resources,  and  limited  leverage  to  undertake  FTA  negotiations  in  poorer \neconomies.  The  ASEAN  framework  offers  the  possibility  of  pooling  scarce  capacity  and \nresources. \n\nMiddle-income  countries  such  as  Malaysia  and  Thailand  have  emerged  as  regional \nproduction hubs for the auto and electronics industries, respectively. As one of the founding \nmembers  of  ASEAN,  Thailand  has  entered  into  agreements  with  PRC,  India,  Japan,  and \nAustralia and New Zealand.  \n\nThe  geographical  orientation  of  Asian  FTAs  is  summarized  in  Figure  2.  A  high  degree  of \ncross-regional  orientation  among  some  of  the  region's  stronger  economies  is  visible\u2014\nnotably for PRC; India; Korea; Singapore; and Taipei,China. The trend toward cross-regional \nFTAs  is  even  more  evident  in  Asia's  proposed  FTAs  and  those  under  negotiation  (see \nAppendix Table 3 for details). It appears that Asia has a strong preference to maintain open \ntrading  relations  with  the  rest  of  the  world  rather  than  becoming  inward-looking  (Kawai \n2005). \n\n                                                 \n4 Brunei Darussalam, Chile, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n\n \n\n8\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 144 \n \n\nKawai and Wignaraja \n\nFigure 2: Geographical Orientation and Share of Concluded FTAs in Integrating \nAsia\u2014FTAs within Integrating Asia and Cross-Regionally \n(Number of FTAs) \n\nWithin Integrating Asia\n\nCross-Regionally\n\n20\n\n18\n16\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n6\n4\n\n2\n0\n\ni\n\na\nd\no\nb\nm\na\nC\n\nl\n\nm\na\na\ns\ns\nu\nr\na\nD\n\n \ni\ne\nn\nu\nr\nB\n\nC\nR\nP\n\ni\n\na\nd\nn\nI\n\nn\na\np\na\nJ\n\ni\n\na\ns\ne\nn\no\nd\nn\nI\n\ni\n\na\nn\nh\nC\n\n \n,\ng\nn\no\nK\n \ng\nn\no\nH\n\nf\no\n \n.\np\ne\nR\n\n \n,\na\ne\nr\no\nK\n\n \n\nR\nD\nP\n \no\na\nL\n\ni\n\na\ns\ny\na\n\nl\n\na\nM\n\nr\na\nm\nn\na\ny\nM\n\ns\ne\nn\np\np\n\ni\n\ni\nl\ni\n\nh\nP\n\ne\nr\no\np\na\ng\nn\nS\n\ni\n\ni\n\na\nn\nh\nC\n\n,\ni\ne\np\n\ni\n\na\nT\n\nd\nn\na\n\nl\ni\n\na\nh\nT\n\nm\na\nN\n\n \nt\ne\n\ni\n\nV\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank; FTA = free trade agreement; Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; PRC = \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. \n\nNote: FTAs within Integrating Asia cover FTAs where all partners are in integrating Asia.  \n\nSource: ADB\u2019s Asia Regional Integration Center (ARIC) FTA Database (www.aric.adb.org), data as of June 2009. \n\n2.4  Trade Coverage of FTAs \n\nThe numbers of FTAs are relatively easy to track over time, but by themselves the numbers \ndo not indicate the importance of FTAs to economic activity or trade at the national level. It is \ninformative  to  get  an  idea  of  how  much  of  a  country\u2019s  world  trade  is  covered  by  FTA \nprovisions.5 This is difficult to measure because of exceptions and exclusions contained in \nmany  agreements.  Furthermore,  official  statistics  on  utilization  rates  of  FTA  preferences  in \nAsia are hard to come by and published data on the direction of services trade do not exist. \nNevertheless, by making the bold assumption that all goods trade is covered by concluded \nFTAs,  indicative  estimates  can  be  obtained.6 Accordingly,  Figure  3  shows  the  share  of  an \neconomy\u2019s bilateral trade with its FTA partners in its total trade with the world for 2000 and \n2008. Two points are worth noting: \n\nFirst,  the  region's  larger  economies  have  smaller  shares  in  2008  than  ASEAN  members, \nhighlighting the latter\u2019s greater reliance on FTAs, especially AFTA. The shares for the large \neconomies  are:  Korea  (44%),  PRC  (25%),  India  (23%),  and  Japan  (11%).  There  is  some \ndiversity  within  ASEAN,  with  Brunei  Darussalum  and  Lao  PDR  having  shares  in  excess  of \n\n                                                 \n5 On this point, see Fiorentino, Crawford, and Toqueboeuf (2009). \n6 We are grateful for Richard Baldwin for this suggestion.  \n\n \n\n9\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 144 \n \n\nKawai and Wignaraja \n\n75%,  and  Singapore,  Malaysia,  and  Myanmar  over  50%,  while  others  range  between  35% \nand 49%.7 Meanwhile, Taipei,China has the lowest trade coverage by FTAs at 1%. \n\nSecond, all Asian countries experienced a significant increase in reliance on FTAs between \n2000 and 2008, reflecting the spread of FTAs throughout the region. Key Asian FTA hubs\u2014\nJapan, Korea, PRC, and India\u2014have experienced at least a quadrupling of shares over the \nperiod.

CHALLENGES POSED BY ASIAN FREE TRADE \n\nAGREEMENTS \n\nAs  FTAs  have  spread  across  Asia,  concerns  over  such  agreements  have  increased.  A \ncursory  analysis  of  the  growing  number  of  political  debates,  media  stories,  policy  studies, \nand conference reports on Asian FTAs indicates that a host of challenges exist for regional \nintegration.  It  is  not  possible  in  this  short  paper  to  address  all  the  economic,  political,  and \nlegal issues arising from the subject of integration. From a pragmatic perspective and with a \nview  to  making  suggestions,  five  key  challenges  associated  with  Asian  FTAs  merit  further \nexamination:  (i)  improving  firm-level  use  of  FTAs,  (ii)  tackling  the  Asian  \u201cnoodle  bowl\u201d \nproblem, (iii) promoting comprehensive coverage of agricultural trade, (iv) increasing WTO-\nplus elements, and (v) forming a region-wide FTA. New evidence from firm surveys, analysis \nof agreements, and CGE models can be useful in addressing some of these challenges and \nindicating the way forward. \n\n                                                 \n7 In  Singapore's  case,  the  high  ratio  reflects  a  proactive  strategy  of  concluding  a  large  number  of  bilateral  and \nASEAN FTAs. In Lao PDR and Brunei Darussalam, this ratio may suggest high commodity dependence and \nmarket concentration in a limited export base. \n\n \n\n10\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 144 \n \n\nKawai and Wignaraja \n\n3.1  Challenge 1: Improving Firm-Level Use of FTA Preferences \n\nImproving  preference  use  at  the  firm  level  is  probably  the  most  important  challenge \nassociated  with  Asian  FTAs.  Well  designed  and  comprehensive  FTAs  provide  numerous \nbenefits, including  preferential  tariffs,  market  access, and  new  business  opportunities.  One \nmight assume that firms would desire to avail of such benefits once a given FTA is in effect. \nPrevious  studies  at  the  country  and  industry  levels,  however,  suggest  that  FTA  preference \nutilization  rates\u2014based  on  shares  of  export  value  enjoying  preferences\u2014are  low  in  East \nAsian countries and that FTAs are  underutilized (Baldwin  2006; World Bank 2007). A firm-\nlevel study of Japan's FTAs also reported modest preference utilization rates and related this \nto  the  low  volume  of  trade  with  FTA  partner  countries  (Takahashi  and  Urata  2008). \nAccordingly,  Asian  FTAs  are  often  viewed  as  discriminatory  and  a  drain  on  scarce  trade \nnegotiation capacity in developing countries (Bhagwati 2008).  \n\nFive comprehensive surveys of exporting firms conducted in 2007\u20132008 by ADB and several \npartners in Japan, Korea, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand shed light on the use of FTA \npreferences. 8   Although  data  on  shares  of  export  value  enjoying  preferences  were  not \navailable  from  the  enterprise  surveys,  it  was  possible  to  estimate  utilization  of  FTA \npreferences  based  on  the  incidence  of  firms\u2014i.e.,  the  share  of  sample  firms  in  a  given \ncountry\u2014that use FTA preferences. Figure 4 shows this measure for firms that use and plan \nto use FTAs. East Asian exporting firms tend to utilize FTA preferences more frequently than \npreviously thought and may even be increasing their utilization rate. Of the 609 East Asian \nsample  firms,  22%  use  FTA  preferences.  When  plans  for  using  FTA  preferences  are  also \nfactored in, 44% of all East Asian firms either use or plan to use FTA preferences. Japanese \nand Thai firms are the highest users of FTA preferences, while firms from Korea, Philippines, \nand Singapore make relatively less use of preferences. Plans for heightened preference use \nare  present  in  all  five  countries\u2014in  particular  Korea,  Japan,  and  Thailand.  While  these \nfindings  are  encouraging,  room  for  improvement  exists  in  FTA  preference  use  at  the  firm \nlevel.  \n\n                                                 \n8 For  an  overview  of  the  firm  surveys,  see  Kawai  and  Wignaraja  (2009b).  The  firm  surveys  for  the  individual \n\ncountries will be published by ADBI as working papers and later as a book.  \n\n \n\n11\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 144 \n \n\nKawai and Wignaraja \n\nFigure 4: Utilization of FTA Preferences  \n(% of Respondents) \n\nUse FTA \n\nUse or Plan to Use FTA\n\n54.2\n\n47.4\n\n45.7\n\n40.7\n\n29.0\n\n28.0\n\n17.3\n\n20.8\n\n24.9\n\n20.0\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nJapan\n\nSingapore\n\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nThailand\n\nPhilippines\n\nFTA = free trade agreement. \n\nSource: Kawai and Wignaraja (2009b). \n\n \n\nT-tests  indicate  that  the  most  striking  difference  between  FTA  preference  users  and  non-\nusers in East Asian countries is a significant difference in firm size. Japan stands out for its \nbase  of  large  multinational  corporations.  The  average  number  of  employees  among \nJapanese firms using FTA preferences is 30,104, while this number is 1,098 in Singapore, \n591 in Thailand, and 395 in the Philippines. The average number of employees among non-\nusers  is  7,020  in  Japan,  291  in  Thailand,  269  in  the  Philippines,  and  142  in  Singapore. \nAccordingly, a classic firm size effect seems to underlie the pattern of FTA preference use in \nthe East Asian sample. The results suggest that using FTAs entails large fixed costs\u2014e.g., \nlearning  about  FTA  provisions,  tailoring  business  plans  to  complex  tariff  schedules,  and \nobtaining  certificates  of  origin\u2014and  larger  firms  are  better  able  to  muster  the  requisite \nfinancial and human resources than small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).  \n\nThe  reasons  that  the  majority  of  East  Asian  sample  firms  do  not  currently  use  FTA \npreferences  are  not  widely  known.  The  ADB  surveys  generated  responses  from  325  East \nAsian  sample  firms  on  the  reasons for  non-use  of  FTA  preferences.  Surprisingly,  a  lack  of \ninformation on FTAs is the most significant reason for non-use of preferences as reported by \n45%  of  firms  surveyed.  Low  margins  of  preference  (26%)  and  delays  and  administrative \ncosts associated with rules of origin (25%) were the second and third most common reasons \ncited.  Other  notable  reasons  for  non-use  include:  use  of  other  schemes  such  as  export \nprocessing  zones  and  the  Information  Technology  Agreement  for  exporters,  which  also \nprovide  incentives  for  exporters  (11%),  and  non-tariff  measures  in  partner  countries  (9%) \nthat inhibit exports and, hence, use of FTA preferences.  \n\nAccordingly,  use  of  FTA  preferences  can  be  encouraged  by  raising  awareness  of  (i)  FTA \nprovisions, including phasing out tariff schedules; (ii) margins of preference at product level; \nand  (iii)  administrative  procedures  for  rules  of  origin  (ROOs).  Business  associations  and \ngovernments could make information on how to use FTAs more transparent, particularly for \nSMEs. Practical ideas include frequent seminars with SMEs, television programs directed at \nbusinesses,  and  dedicated  websites  and  telephone  help  lines.  More  generally,  institutional \n\n \n\n12\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 144 \n \n\nKawai and Wignaraja \n\nsupport  systems  for  businesses,  particularly  for  SMEs,  need  to  be  improved.  Existing \nsupport  systems  for  exporting  under  FTAs  are  of  varying  quality  and  take-up  rates. \nSignificant  public  and  private  investment  is  required  in  East  Asia  to  improve  coverage  of \nsupport  services,  upgrade  service  quality,  and  reduce  bureaucratic  impediments  to  service \nuse.  Business  and  industry  associations  will  have  to  play  a  greater  role  in  providing \nmembers  with  support  services  for  exporting  under  FTAs.  Attention  might  focus  on \nupgrading  the  technical  standards,  quality,  and  productivity  of  SMEs  so  that  they  can \nparticipate more fully in regional production networks driven by large firms.  \n\n3.2  Challenge 2: Tackling the Asian \u201cNoodle Bowl\u201d Problem \n\nROOs  are  another  potentially  challenging  aspect  of  Asian  FTAs.  These  are  devices  to \ndetermine  which  goods  will  enjoy  preferential  tariffs  in  order  to  prevent  trade  deflection \namong FTA members. For manufactured goods, ROOs comprise three types: (i) a change in \ntariff classification rule defined at a detailed harmonized system level; (ii) a local (or regional) \nvalue content rule, which requires a product to satisfy a minimum local (or regional) value in \nthe country (or region) of an FTA; and (iii) a specific process rule, which requires a specific \nproduction process for an item (Estevadeordal and Suominen 2006). An influential strand of \nliterature  argues  that  Asian  FTAs  have  complicated  ROOs,  sparking  concerns  about  what \nthe attendant rules and administrative procedures would imply for the cost of doing business \n(Manchin  and  Pelkmans-Balaoing  2007;  Tumbarello  2007).  This  literature  claims  that \nrestrictive  ROOs  in  Asian  FTAs  deter  the  use  of  FTA  preferences,  while  complex  ROOs \nraise  transactions  costs  for  firms.  With  the  rapid  spread  of  FTAs  throughout  Asia,  this \nliterature further suggests that multiple ROOs in overlapping FTAs pose a severe burden on \nSMEs,  which  have  less  ability  to  meet  such  costs.  Originally  termed  a  \u201cspaghetti  bowl\u201d  of \ntrade  deals  (Bhagwati  1995),  this  phenomenon  has  become  widely  known  as  the  \u201cnoodle \nbowl\u201d  effect  in  Asia.  Others  suggest  that  the  depiction  of  Asian  FTAs  as  a  complicated \nnoodle  bowl  is  misleading.  On  the  contrary,  it  has  been  argued  that  Asian  FTAs  may  be \ncreating an order of a different sort by building the foundation for a stronger regional trading \nsystem (Petri 2008).  \n\nTo what extent are multiple ROOs perceived as a problem by businesses in Asia? The ADB \nfirm  surveys  provide  interesting  insights  into  this  issue.  Specifically,  the  surveys  provide \nenterprise  perceptions  of  whether  dealing  with  multiple  ROOs  in  the  region\u2019s  FTAs  would \nsignificantly  add  to  business  costs.  The  main  findings  suggested  by  the  surveys  are  given \nbelow. \n\nFirst,  at  the  present  level  of  concluded  FTAs  in  the  region,  the  evidence  suggests  that \nmultiple  ROOs  impose  a  limited  burden  on  firms  in  East  Asia.  Of  the  465  firms  that \nresponded  to  the  question  on  this  issue,  124  firms  (27%)  said  that  multiple  ROOs  do \nsignificantly add to business costs. Meanwhile, the bulk of the sample firms did not think that \nthey  were  a  problem  at  present.  However,  the  aggregate  figure  masks  interesting  country-\nlevel  variations  in  perceptions.  Singaporean  firms  had  the  most  negative  perceptions \nregarding  multiple  ROOs  (38%),  while  Korean  firms  had  the  least  negative  perceptions \n(15%).  In  between  these  two  extremes  were  Japanese,  Philippine,  and  Thai  firms  with \nnegative responses of 31%, 28%, and 26%, respectively. National FTA strategies, industrial \nstructures, and the quality of institutional support may underlie differences in perceptions of \nROOs across Asian countries.  \n\nSecond,  the  surveys  suggest  that  larger  firms  in  Asia  have  more  negative  perceptions  of \nmultiple  ROOs  than  SMEs,  which  was  an  unexpected  finding  (Figure  5).  The  relationship \nbetween  firm  size  and  concerns  about  multiple  ROOs  presents  an  interesting  puzzle  for \nresearch. Econometric analysis to resolve the puzzle shows that large established firms tend \nto  export  to  multiple  markets  and  change  their  business  plans  in  response  to  FTAs. \nTherefore,  they  are  more  likely  to  complain  about  issues  of  multiple  ROOs  (Kawai  and \nWignaraja 2009b). In contrast, smaller firms tend to export to a single market and hence do \n\n \n\n13\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 144 \n \n\nKawai and Wignaraja \n\nnot have much basis for complaining. While inter-country and intra-firm size variations exist, \nthere does not seem to be much variation in perceptions across sectors.  \n\nFigure 5: Burden Imposed by Multiple Rules of Origin in FTAs \n(% of Respondents by Firm Size) \n\nSME\n\nLarge\n\nGiant\n\n70.0\n\n60.0\n\n50.0\n\n40.0\n\n30.0\n\n20.0\n\n10.0\n\n0.0\n\nAll Firms\n\nJapan\n\nSingapore\n\nThailand\n\nPhilippines\n\nFTA = free trade agreement; SME = small- and medium-sized enterprise. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNote: SME = 100 or fewer employees, Large = 101 to 1,000 employees, Giant = more than 1,000 employees.  \n\nSource: Kawai and Wignaraja (2009b). \n\nThird, most firms want to be able to choose between ROOs included in FTAs. The surveys \nsuggest  that  firms  are  supportive  of  having  alternative  ROOs  for  the  same  product  for \nseveral reasons: (i) if they cannot reach the value content requirement, having another ROO \nenables  them  to  avail  of  FTA  preferences;  (ii)  as  the  application  for  the  value  content  rule \nmay require confidential information on costs, suppliers and many firms are often reluctant to \ndivulge  such  information;  and  (iii)  some  ROOs  may  be  better  aligned  with  the  technology \nand production process of particular industries.  \n\nThe finding of a limited burden imposed by multiple ROOs does not mean that policymakers \nshould be complacent about the issue. As the number of concluded agreements increases, it \nis  possible  that  multiple  ROOs  may  become  more  of  a  problem  for  firms.  Supportive \nmeasures\u2014such  as  encouraging \ntheir \nadministration\u2014are needed to mitigate the negative effects of the Asian noodle bowl in the \nfuture. Widespread gains are possible from pursuing a simplified approach to ROOs in East \nAsia  involving  harmonized  ROOs,  cumulation  of  value  contents,  and  coequality  of  ROOs. \nLikewise,  adoption  of  international  good  practices  in  ROO  administration  would  be  useful. \nThis may include introduction of a trusted trader program, as is the case with NAFTA, that \nwould  allow  successful  applicants  to  self-certify  their  own  certificates  of  origin,  a  switch  to \nbusiness  associations  issuing  certificates  of  origin  for  a  fee,  increased  use  of  information \ntechnology-based systems of ROO administration, and training programs for SMEs. \n\nrationalization  of  ROOs  and  upgrading \n\n \n\n14\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 144 \n \n\nKawai and Wignaraja \n\n3.3  Challenge 3: Promoting Comprehensive Coverage of \n\nAgricultural Trade \n\nA  third  potential  challenge  for  Asian  FTAs  may  be  the  extent  of  coverage  of  goods  trade. \nSome suggest that the coverage of goods trade differs markedly among Asian FTAs, while \nagricultural  products  are  largely  excluded  due  to  pressures  from  powerful  farm  lobbies  or \nsocial concerns over the rural sector, where poverty is predominant in developing countries \n(Feridhanusetyawan  2005).  As  a  result,  there  is  a  sub-optimal  level  of  liberalization  in \nagricultural  products  and  even  conflict  with  the  spirit  of  GATT  article  XXIV,  which  provides \nexemption  to  the  WTO's  most  favored  nation  clause,  or  nondiscriminatory  treatment. \nConsistency  with  GATT  article  XXIV  requires  FTAs  to  eliminate  trade  barriers  on \n\u201csubstantially  all  trade\u201d  in  originating  goods  from  members  within  a  reasonable  period  of \ntime, which is sometimes referred to as the \u201csubstantially all trade\u201d rule. \n\nTwo  problems  have  hampered  empirical  research  on  the  coverage  of  agricultural  goods \ntrade in Asian FTAs. First, little systematic data and analysis is available on the treatment of \nagricultural products across Asian FTAs. Second, clear criteria for the \u201csubstantially all trade\u201d \nrule  do  not  seem  to  exist.  With  the  development  of  new  databases  on  Asian  FTAs\u2014e.g., \nADB\u2019s  Asia  Regional  Integration  Center  database\u2014new  sources  of  FTA  data  are  now \navailable. Furthermore, tariff lines for agricultural products can be used as a basis to gauge \nthe criteria of substantially all trade.  \n\nA  simple  three-fold  classification  system  was  used  to  categorize  Asian  FTAs  according  to \ntariff line coverage of agricultural products. Given the complexity of provisions for agriculture \nin many agreements, and the availability of tariff schedules and exclusion lists at the product \nlevel, a combination of coverage of product lines and exclusions was used to assess each \nagreement. The classifications are as follows:  \n\n\u2022  Comprehensive coverage\u2014at least 85% of all agricultural product lines in a given \nagreement  are  covered,  or  not  more  than  150  product  lines  are  excluded.  FTAs \nwith these features for agricultural products are taken as covering substantially all \ntrade.  \n\n\u2022  No  or  limited  coverage\u2014agricultural  products  are  completely  excluded  in  the \n\nagreement, or less than 100 product lines are included. \n\n\u2022  Some  coverage\u2014more  agricultural  products  are \n\nthan \n\u201ccomprehensive  coverage,\u201d  but  less  products  are  covered  than  \u201cno  or  limited \ncoverage.\u201d  Agreements  with  such  coverage  typically  include  more  than  100 \nagricultural  product  lines,  but  less  than  85%  of  agricultural  product  lines.  These \nagreements may also exclude over 150 agricultural product lines. \n\nin  FTAs \n\nincluded \n\nIt  was  possible  to  apply  this  classification  system  to  50  concluded  Asian  FTAs9  and  the \nresults are shown in Figure 6. Some examples may be illustrative. For example, the Korea\u2013\nChile FTA is taken as a comprehensive agreement for agricultural goods as Korea excludes \nonly 21 agricultural products from the agreement, including rice, apples, and pears. ASEAN \nis  also  regarded  as  a  comprehensive  agreement  as  members  exclude  only  20  agricultural \nproducts  on  average. 10   The  ASEAN\u2013Australia  and  New  Zealand  FTA  follows  the  AFTA \nmodel where most tariffs on agricultural products are bound at 0% upon the FTA's entry into \nforce  or  phased  to  0%  by  2020.  Exclusions  from  tariff  commitments  have  been  kept  to  a \nminimum including rice, sugar, and maize. Using this approach, 25 Asian FTAs (50% of the \ntotal) can be regarded as comprehensive in terms of coverage of agricultural products, while \n                                                 \n9 The  data  exclude  four  agreements  involving  Latin  American  countries  for  which  texts  were  not  available  in \n\nEnglish.  \n\n10 Accordingly, Lao PDR excludes 5 items, Viet Nam 7, Malaysia 16, Philippines 17, Indonesia 24, and Cambodia \nand  Myanmar  36  each.  In  contrast,  Brunei  Darussalam  and  Singapore  eliminated  tariffs  on  all  agricultural \nproducts.  \n\n \n\n15\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 144 \n \n\nKawai and Wignaraja \n\nanother 13 (26%) have some coverage of these items (see Appendix Table 4 for examples \nof  FTAs  with  substantial  coverage  of  agricultural  products).  The  remaining  12  (24%)  have \nlimited  or  no  coverage.  Additional  work  is  needed  to  refine  the  criteria  for  assessing  the \ncoverage of agricultural products in Asian FTAs according to the \u201csubstantially all trade\u201d rule \nand to develop new criteria based on the value of total trade.  \n\nFigure 6: Agricultural Coverage of Integrating Asia FTAs (%) \n\n 26%\n\n24%\n\n50%\n\nComprehensive\n\nExcluded or Limited\n\nSome Coverage\n\nFTA = free trade agreement, WTO = World Trade Organization. \n\nNotes:  \n\n \n\n(i) The data cover 50 Integrating Asia FTAs and do not include Taipei,China\u2013Nicaragua FTA; Taipei,China\u2013El \nSalvador\u2013Honduras FTA; Taipei,China\u2013Guatemala FTA; and Singapore\u2013Peru FTA due to difficulty in accessing \nofficial English translations of FTAs.

This  is  a  key  element  of  the \ncontinuation of the liberalization agenda for trade in goods. An important future step would \nbe  to  include  provisions  on  agricultural  products  in  all  prospective  agreements.  This  would \nserve as a signal for producers to adjust to competition and improve productivity. A next step \nwould  be  meeting  the  benchmark  for  comprehensiveness by  ensuring  coverage  of  at  least \n85% of all agricultural product lines in a given agreement and minimizing exclusions to not \nmore  than  150  product  lines.  This  can  be  done  by  adopting  a  negative  list  approach  to \nagricultural products with a few sensitive items. Issues for the future would include a realistic \ntariff  elimination  schedule,  a  transparent  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  regime,  and  reform  of \nsubsidies. \n\n3.4  Challenge 4: Increasing WTO-Plus Elements \n\nAsian FTAs are under increasing scrutiny for their scope, i.e., inclusion of new issues that go \nbeyond the WTO framework. The WTO system that emerged from the Uruguay Round in the \nmid-1990s  consisted  of  substantive  agreements  on  goods  and  services.  The  subsequent \nWTO Doha Development Round initiated in 2001 has focused on liberalization in agriculture \nand  non-agricultural  market  access. The  four  Singapore  issues  were  conditionally included \n\n \n\n16\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 144 \n \n\nKawai and Wignaraja \n\nin  the  work  program  for  the  Doha  Round,  but  were  dropped  at  the  WTO  Ministerial \nConference  in  Cancun  in  2004.  WTO-plus  agreements  and  new  age  FTAs,  which  are \ncomprehensive  FTAs  that  address  the  Singapore  issues,  are  becoming  more  common \nglobally (Fiorentino Crawford, and Toqueboeuf 2009). An increase in WTO-plus elements in \nthe  landscape  of  Asian  FTAs  has  been  identified  as  a  pressing  challenge  for  economies. \nStudies  suggest  that  Asian  FTAs  vary  considerably  in  their  scope  with  some  sophisticated \nagreements  alongside  limited  FTAs  (Banda  and  Whalley  2005;  Plummer  2007). 11   Yet, \nsystematic  cross-country  evidence  on  the  scope  of  Asian  FTAs  is  lacking,  particularly  with \nregard to more recent agreements.  \n\nFigure  7  shows  the  scope  of  concluded  Asian  FTAs  at  the  national  level  according  to  (i) \nnarrow  agreements  that  primarily  deal  with  good  and/or  services,  and  have  few  WTO-plus \nelements;  and  (ii)  broad  agreements  with  many  WTO-plus  elements.  The  scope  of \nconcluded agreements reflects a combination of economic interests, economic strength, and \nnegotiation capacity. See Appendix Table 5 for details.  \n\nFigure 7: Scope of Concluded FTAs in Integrating Asia \n(Number of FTAs) \n\nGoods and/or Services\n\nWTO-plus\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nC\nR\nP\n\na\n\ni\n\nd\nn\nI\n\nn\na\np\na\nJ\n\ni\n\na\ns\ne\nn\no\nd\nn\nI\n\nR\nD\nP\n \no\na\nL\n\ni\n\na\ns\ny\na\na\nM\n\nl\n\nr\na\nm\nn\na\ny\nM\n\ns\ne\nn\np\np\n\ni\n\ni\nl\ni\n\nh\nP\n\ne\nr\no\np\na\ng\nn\nS\n\ni\n\ni\n\na\nn\nh\nC\n\n,\ni\n\ni\n\ne\np\na\nT\n\nd\nn\na\n\nl\ni\n\na\nh\nT\n\nm\na\nN\n\n \nt\ne\nV\n\ni\n\ni\n\na\nd\no\nb\nm\na\nC\n\nl\n\nm\na\na\ns\ns\nu\nr\na\nD\n\n \ni\n\ne\nn\nu\nr\nB\n\ni\n\na\nn\nh\nC\n\n \n,\ng\nn\no\nK\n \ng\nn\no\nH\n\nf\no\n \n.\np\ne\nR\n\n \n,\na\ne\nr\no\nK\n\n \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank; FTA = free trade agreement; Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; PRC = \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China; WTO = World Trade Organization. \n\nNote: Data do not include Taipei,China\u2013Nicaragua and Taipei,China\u2013El Salvador\u2013Honduras FTAs due to difficulty in \naccessing official English translation of the FTAs.  \n\nSource: ADB\u2019s Asia Regional Integration Center (ARIC) FTA Database (www.aric.adb.org); data as of June 2009. \n\n                                                 \n11 An  early  review  of  11  Asian  agreements  concluded  that  \"modern  FTAs  in  Asia,  some  of  which  are  the  most \nsophisticated  in  the  world,  have  tended  to  be  more  comprehensive  in  terms  of  coverage  and  of  the  building \nbloc  rather  than  the  stumbling  bloc  type,  though  there  are  some  (minor)  exceptions  in  terms  of  certain \ncomponents\" (Plummer, 2007: 1795). The study suggested a set of best practices to guide future FTAs.  \n\n \n\n17\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 144 \n \n\nKawai and Wignaraja \n\nThree  leading  participants  in  Asian  FTAs\u2014Japan,  Korea,  and  Singapore\u2014strongly  favor  a \nWTO-plus approach to FTAs. Appendix Table 6 summarizes coverage of selected FTAs by \nparticipant. All of Japan's agreements and most of Singapore's and Korea's are WTO-plus. \nLikewise, Thailand and Malaysia largely follow a WTO-plus format. Poorer economies, such \nas Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam, as well as the Philippines and Indonesia, \nwhich rely heavily on ASEAN for their respective FTA strategies, are party to a mix of WTO-\nplus and other agreements.  \n\nHistorically,  the  PRC  and  India  have  been  relatively  cautious  on  scope,  preferring \nagreements  focusing  on  goods  and  services  elements.  More  recently,  however,  both  have \nbegun  to  experiment  by  incorporating  some  WTO-plus  provisions  such  as  in  the  India\u2013\nSingapore  Comprehensive  Economic  Cooperation  Agreement  (CECA)  and  the  PRC\u2013New \nZealand FTA. Thus, with a few exceptions, Asian economies are increasingly favoring WTO-\nplus agreements rather than narrowly limited agreements. \n\nSome  additional  points  are  noteworthy  about  WTO-plus  provisions  in  Asian  FTAs  (Kawai \nand  Wignaraja  2009a).  First,  agreements  between  developed  countries  and  developing \ncountries generally take a WTO-plus format. Examples include the ASEAN\u2013Japan FTA, US\u2013\nSingapore  FTA,  US\u2013Korea  FTA,  and  PRC\u2013New  Zealand  FTA.  Second,  Korea  and \nSingapore  tend  to  behave  like  developed  countries  in  their  agreements  with  many \ndeveloping countries. This behavior is visible in the Transpacific Strategic EPA, Singapore\u2013\nPRC FTA, and Korea\u2013Chile FTA. Third, some existing FTAs are gradually being expanded \nto  have  WTO-plus  coverage.  Comprehensive  agreements  under  negotiation  include  the \nASEAN\u2013Korea CEPA and the India\u2013Sri Lanka CEPA.  \n\nThe  inclusion  of  WTO-plus  provisions\u2014particularly  the  four  Singapore  issues\u2014would  be \ndesirable  in  all  future  Asian  FTAs.  For  example,  competition  policy  and  investment \nprovisions  are  integral  ingredients  in  facilitating  FDI  inflows  and  the  development  of \nproduction  networks.  Inclusion  of  provisions  on  trade  facilitation  and  logistics  development \nwould help lower transactions costs in conducting trade. Cooperation provisions\u2014along the \nline  of  the  APEC  economic  and  technical  cooperation  (ECOTECH)  agenda 12 \u2014would \nstimulate  technology  transfer  and  industrial  competitiveness.  In  their  FTA  negotiations,  the \nUS and EU prefer a single undertaking and the inclusion of these WTO-plus provisions. The \nUS\u2013Singapore and US\u2013Korea agreements are cases in point. ASEAN is also considering an \nASEAN  Investment  Agreement  as  a  part  of  the  process  of  moving  toward  an  ASEAN \nEconomic Community by 2015. \n\n3.5  Challenge 5: Forming a Region-Wide FTA \n\nFinally, there is increasing recognition in Asia of the merits in forming a region-wide FTA as \na  means  to  consolidate  the  plethora  of  bilateral  and  plurilateral  agreements.  Such  an  FTA \nwould  confer  various  economic  benefits:  (i)  increase  market  access  to  goods,  services, \nskills,  and  technology  (ii)  increase  market  size  to  permit  specialization  and  realization  of \neconomies of scale; (iii) facilitie the FDI activities and technology transfer of MNCs; and (iv) \npermit simplification of tariff schedules, rules, and standards.  \n\nASEAN\u2014with the region's oldest FTA\u2014is emerging as an integration hub for FTAs in East \nAsia.  PRC,  Japan,  and  Korea  have  implemented  their  respective  FTAs  with  ASEAN.  India \nand Australia and New Zealand are also following suit and implementing FTAs with ASEAN. \nWith key ASEAN+1 agreements underway, the policy discussion in East Asia is focusing on \ncompeting  region-wide  FTA  proposals\u2014an  East  Asia  Free  Trade  Area  (EAFTA)  among \nASEAN+3  countries  and  a  Comprehensive  Economic  Partnership  for  East  Asia  (CEPEA) \namong  ASEAN+6  countries\u2014that  will  guide  future  policy-led  integration  in  the  region. \n\n                                                 \n12  ECOTECH  is  the  APEC  schedule  of  programs  designed  to  build  capacity  and  skills  in  APEC  member \neconomies to enable them to participate more fully in the regional economy and the liberalization process. See \nhttp://www.apec.org for more information. \n\n \n\n18\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 144 \n \n\nKawai and Wignaraja \n\nSeeking to bridge ASEAN and its Northeast Asian neighbors, the EAFTA was an early vision \nof an East Asia-wide FTA. CEPEA has emerged through the realization that synergies could \nbe  gained  by  linking  ASEAN+3  countries  with  India  and  Australia  and  New  Zealand.  An \nimportant challenge is to identify which of the two is more beneficial, between an EAFTA and \nCEPEA, in terms of economic welfare for Asia.  \n\nSome studies using CGE models have been conducted on the impact of prospective FTAs \non East Asian economies (Gilbert, Scollay, and Bora 2004; Bchir and Fouquin 2006). CGE \nmodels have the advantage of being based on consistent structural equations that describe \neconomic  activity  in  each  economy.  While  there  has  been  some  CGE  work  on  an  EAFTA \nand  other  alternatives,  only  limited  work  is  available  on  the  effects  of  a  CEPEA  and  on  a \ncomparison between an EAFTA and CEPEA (a recent example is Lee, Owen, and van der \nMensbrugghe  2009).  Furthermore,  such  work  tends  to  narrowly  focus  on  an  FTA  involving \ngoods  only,  while  other  aspects  of  East  Asian  FTA  coverage\u2014such  as  services  and  trade \ncosts\u2014are excluded. A more comprehensive set of CGE estimates is required to inform the \npolicy debate. \n\nFigure 8 shows the results of a CGE exercise for economies in Integrating Asia. The EAFTA \nscenario provides for free trade among the 10 ASEAN members, PRC, Japan, and Korea. \nThe  CEPEA  scenario  broadens  the  EAFTA  scenario  to  include  India,  Australia,  and  New \nZealand.  Four  model  features  are  noteworthy:  (i)  strong  microeconomic  foundations  and \ndetailed  interactions  among  industries,  consumers,  and  governments  across  the  global \neconomy;  (ii)  medium-  to  long-run  investment  effects  by  allowing  for  trade  to  affect  capital \nstocks  through  investment  activities;  (iii)  use  of  the  Global  Trade  Analysis  Project  (GTAP) \ndatabase  (version  6.3)  through  to  2017,13 which  projects  trade  and  production  patterns  to \nrepresent a post-Uruguay Round world using the phaseout of the Agreement on Textiles and \nClothing,  the  implementation  of  the  remaining  WTO  commitments  under  the  Doha  Round, \nand  enlargement  of  the  EU  to  27  members;  and  (iv)  a  stylized  FTA  that  includes  goods, \nservices,  and  some  aspects  of  trade  cost  reduction.  The model's  baseline  is  2017  and  the \nsimulations  show  changes  from  this  baseline.  As  the  formation  of  a  region-wide  FTA  may \ntake time, setting up the model and dataset in this way provides for more realistic scenarios.  \n\n                                                 \n13 From  Kawai  and  Wignaraja  (2009a).  These  estimates  are  from  the  CGE  model  developed  in  Francois  and \n\nWignaraja (2008). \n\n \n\n19\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 144 \n \n\nKawai and Wignaraja \n\nFigure 8: Income Effects of Alternative Scenarios Compared to 2017 Baseline \n(% Change in GDP) \n\nEAFTA CEPEA\n\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n\nT hailand\n\nViet N a m\n\nK orea\n\nM alaysia\n\nSingapore\n\nP hilippines\n\nIndonesia\n\nIndia\n\nJapan\n\nP R C\n\nH ong K ong, C hina\nOther A S E A N\nT aipei,C hina\nC a m bodia\n\nASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations; CEPEA = Comprehensive Economic Partnership for East Asia; \nCGE = computable general equilibrium; EAFTA = East Asia Free Trade Area; GDP = gross domestic product. \n\nSource: Kawai and Wignaraja (2009a) based on the CGE model used in Francois and Wignaraja (2008).  \n\n \n\nThree  overall  results  can  be  highlighted  from  the  CGE  exercise  in  terms  of  percentage \nchange  from  2017  baseline  income:  (i)  a  region-wide  FTA,  whether  an  EAFTA  or  CEPEA, \noffers larger gains to world income than the current wave of bilateral and plurilateral FTAs; \n(ii) the CEPEA scenario, which is broader in terms of country coverage, offers larger gains to \nthe world as a whole in terms of income (US$260 billion, measured in constant 2001 prices) \nthan the EAFTA scenario and (iii) third parties outside either an EAFTA or CEPEA lose little \nfrom being excluded from a region-wide agreement. Our overall findings broadly echo those \nof  Lee,  Owen,  and  van  der  Mensbrugghe  (2009),  whose  sophisticated  CGE  exercise \nincorporates tariff reduction, trade cost reduction, and endogenously determined productivity \nlevels.  These  authors  also  suggest that  the  CEPEA  scenario  (US$201  billion)  yields  larger \ngains  than  the  EAFTA  scenario  (US$177  billion),  and  that  insiders  gain  while  losses  to \noutsiders are negligible. \n\n\u2022  Some  interesting  national  level  results  in  terms  of  percentage  change  from  2017 \n\nbaseline income emerge from this exercise (see Figure 8):  \n\n\u2022  For  ASEAN\u2019s  more  dynamic  members,  projected  gains  are  significant  under  the \nCEPEA  scenario:  Thailand  (12.8%),  Viet  Nam  (7.6%),  Malaysia  (6.3%),  and \nSingapore (5.4%). For the rest of ASEAN\u2014Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines, and \nremaining ASEAN economies\u2014the gains are less than 3.0%. \n\n\u2022  Among Northeast Asian countries, Korea experiences the largest gains under the \n\nEAFTA (6.2%) and CEPEA (6.4%) scenarios. \n\n \n\n20\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 144 \n \n\nKawai and Wignaraja \n\n\u2022 \n\nIndia,  Australia,  and  New  Zealand  experience  losses  under  the  EAFTA  scenario \nand gains under the CEPEA scenario. The losses under an EAFTA are less than \n0.5% for each, while under a CEPEA, gains are 2.4% for India, 3.9% for Australia, \nand 5.2% for New Zealand.  \n\n\u2022  Third  parties  like  Hong  Kong,  China  and  Taipei,China  experience  small  losses \n\nfrom being excluded from both EAFTA and CEPEA.  \n\nThe  CGE  analysis  indicates  that  a  region-wide  agreement  in  East  Asia,  particularly  a \nCEPEA,  provides  welfare  gains  over  the  present  wave  of  bilateralism. 14   The  gains  to \nmembers  of  such  an  agreement  are  notable,  while  losses  to  non-members  are  relatively \nsmall.  Accordingly,  arguments  for  and  moves  toward  CEPEA  are  supported  by  economic \nmodeling.  The  CGE  analysis  also  reveals  that  some  members  gain  more  than  others  and \nthis  issue  may  need  to  be  addressed  in  policy  discussions.  There  is  a  case  for  further \nnarrowing  development  gaps  by  providing  financial  and  technical  support  for  low-income \ncountries,  particularly  with  respect  to  trade-related  infrastructure,  customs  modernization, \nenhancing SME development, and capacity building.  \n\n4.  POLITICAL ECONOMY CONSIDERATIONS OF FTA \n\nCONSOLIDATION IN ASIA \n\nEven if the consolidation of FTAs into a region-wide agreement\u2014whether in the form of an \nEAFTA among the ASEAN+3 countries or a CEPEA among the ASEAN+6 countries\u2014yields \nlarge  economic  gains  to  East  Asia,  it  is  not  obvious  that  such  a  region-wide  FTA  can  be \ncreated given political economy considerations. The PRC has been a strong supporter of an \nEAFTA, while Japan has put more emphasis on a CEPEA. In addition, political rivalry over \nFTA  leadership  in  East Asia  may  hinder  any  such  joint  venture.  Also,  given  the  role  of  the \nUS  in  Asia as  a  security  anchor  for  many  countries,  one  may  argue  that  excluding  the  US \nfrom  the  Asian  integration  process  may  not  be  viable  from  a  political  perspective. \nFurthermore,  the  rising  importance  of  European  markets  for  many  Asian  economies \nsuggests that involving Europe may also make sense. \n\nWe consider three competing scenarios for consolidation of various East Asian FTAs into a \nlarger FTA: (i) an East Asia-wide FTA, either in the form of an EAFTA or CEPEA; (ii) a Free \nTrade Area of the Asia\u2013Pacific (FTAAP) among APEC countries; and (iii) a Free Trade Area \nof Asia and Europe (FTAAE) among Asia\u2013Europe Meeting (ASEM) countries. An East Asia-\nwide  FTA,  whether  an  EAFTA  or  CEPEA,  addresses  the  noodle  bowl  problem  among  the \nproduction  network  countries,  while  an  FTAAP  or  an  FTAAE  takes  into  account  external \nmarkets as well. The idea of forming an EAFTA or CEPEA has been on the official agenda \nof  the  ASEAN+3  Leaders\u2019  process  and  East  Asia  Summit  meetings.  In  the  same  vein,  an \nFTAAP has been officially considered in the APEC Leaders\u2019 process. However, the idea of \nestablishing an FTAAE has not attracted much attention so far.  \n\nTo discuss these scenarios and their feasibility, some political economy considerations have \nto be made with regard to an East Asia-wide FTA (EAFTA or CEPEA) and an FTAAP. \n\n4.1  Building Blocks for Wider Agreements  \n\nDue to a rise in the number of key players in official negotiations for FTAs, creating a large \nFTA can become more complicated. This suggests that forming an FTAAP would be more \ncomplex  than  forming  a  CEPEA,  and  that  forming  a  CEPEA  would  be  more  complex  than \nforming an EAFTA. Therefore, the first step toward consolidation of various FTAs might be to \n                                                 \n14 As Lee, Owen, and van der Mensbrugghe (2009) observed, a worthwhile but difficult extension of CGE models \non  region-wide  Asian  FTAs  would  be  to  endogenize  FDI  flows  involving  Asian  countries.  Consistent  data  on \nbilateral FDI flows in Asia, however, are lacking.  \n\n \n\n21\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 144 \n \n\nKawai and Wignaraja \n\ncreate preconditions\u2014or building blocks\u2014for a smaller region-wide FTA, like an EAFTA, and \nthen to develop further conditions toward a wider FTA, such as a CEPEA or FTAAP. In this \nprocess, ASEAN will likely act as the integration hub or convener. The \u201c+3 countries\u201d\u2014PRC, \nJapan, and Korea\u2014would then need to coordinate their trade and FDI regimes. India, which \nhas  only  recently  moved  away  from  its  former  protectionist  enclosure,  needs  to  pursue \ndeeper  structural  and  regulatory  reforms  addressing  both  tariff  issues  and  \u201cbehind-the-\nborder\u201d red tape.  \n\nAn  EAFTA  or  CEPEA.  An  EAFTA  or  a  CEPEA  would  likely  be  based  on  the  existing \nASEAN+1 FTAs with the \u201cplus countries\u201d\u2014such as PRC, Japan, Korea, India, Australia, and \nNew Zealand\u2014as well as future networks of plurilateral and/or bilateral FTAs among these \nplus  countries.  Almost  all  of  the  five  ASEAN+1  FTAs  have  been  completed,  with  the \nASEAN+India FTA expected to be signed soon. In contrast, other multilateral and/or bilateral \nFTAs  are  patchy  and  some  important  components\u2014such  as  a  trilateral  FTA  among  PRC, \nJapan,  and  Korea  or  three  bilateral  FTAs  among  these  three  countries\u2014are  still  missing \n(Table 1). All these FTAs can facilitate the formation of an EAFTA or CEPEA as important \nbuilding  blocks.  From  this  perspective,  the  successful  formation  of  an  EAFTA  or  CEPEA \nrequires not only a set of ASEAN+1 FTAs, but also a series of agreements among the plus \ncountries, particularly among PRC, Japan, and Korea.  \n\nTable 1: Bilateral and Plurilateral FTAs \n(by status) \n\n \n\nASEAN \n\nJapan \n\nPRC \n\nIndia  Australia \n\nASEAN \nJapan \nPRC \nKorea, Rep. \nof \nIndia \nAustralia \nNew Zealand \n\n\u2297\n\nstarted.  \n\n\u2297 \n\u2297 \n\u2297 \n\u2297 \n\n\u03bf \n\u2297 \n\n\u2297 \n\u2014 \n\u2666 \n\u03bf \n\n\u03bf \n\u03bf \n\u2666 \n\nKorea, \nRep. of \n\u2297 \n\u03bf \n\u2666 \n\u2014 \n\n\u03bf \n\u2666 \n\u03bf \n\n\u03bf \n\u03bf \n\u2666 \n\u03bf \n\n\u2014 \n\u2666 \n\u2666 \n\n\u2297 \n\u2666 \n\u2014 \n\u2666 \n\n\u2666 \n\u03bf \n\u2297 \n\nNew \nZealand \n\n\u2297 \n\n\u2666 \n\u2297 \n\u03bf \n\n\u2666 \n\u2297 \n\u2014 \n\n\u03bf \n\u03bf \n\u2666 \n\n\u2666 \n\u2014 \n\u2297 \n\n = FTAs negotiations signed or FTAs in place; \u03bf = official negotiation under way; \u2666 = official negotiation has not \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank; ASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations; FTA = free trade agreement; \nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\nSource: ADB\u2019s Asia Regional Integration Center (ARIC) FTA database (www.aric.adb.org); data as of June 2009. \n\nIn  principle,  ASEAN+3  or  ASEAN+6  countries  can  begin  EAFTA  or  CEPEA  negotiations \nwithout some of these important building blocks among the plus-three countries in place, as \nthese blocks can be created as a part of the EAFTA or CEPEA negotiations. Nonetheless, \ngiven that bilateral negotiations between the PRC and Japan will likely take time, it would be \npreferable to conclude such a contentious agreement before starting the official negotiation \nprocess  for  an  EAFTA  or  CEPEA.  With  all  the  building  blocks  in  place,  EAFTA  or  CEPEA \nnegotiations can lead to the early formation of a single, larger FTA through consolidation and \nharmonization of existing FTAs. \n\nThe respective cases vary for supporting an EAFTA and a CEPEA, yet they are linked. An \nimportant  reason  for  an  EAFTA  is  that  the  production  network  has  been  developed  most \nsignificantly  among  the  ASEAN+3  countries,  and  harmonizing  rules  of  origin  among  these \ncountries can produce a tangible benefit. In addition, India is perceived as a slow liberalizer \nand  it  would  take  more  time  to  produce  a  region-wide  FTA  if  India  were  included  from  the \nbeginning. Once a process begins for EAFTA negotiations, pressure could then be applied \nto  India  to  further  open  up  its  economy.  On  the  other  hand,  a  reason  for  advocating  a \nCEPEA  is  that  the  production  network  is  already  developing  beyond  ASEAN+3  countries, \n\n \n\n22\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 144 \n \n\nKawai and Wignaraja \n\nencompassing India and Australia. In addition, the economic benefit from FTA consolidation \nis larger with a CEPEA than with an EAFTA. \n\nThe  officially  appointed  study  group  for  a  CEPEA  has  agreed  that  ASEAN+3  countries \nshould  focus  on  trade  and  investment  liberalization  as  the  first  priority,  facilitation  as  the \nsecond,  and  technical  cooperation  as  the  last,  and  that  ASEAN+6  countries  may  focus  on \ntechnical  cooperation  as  the  top  priority,  trade  and  investment  facilitation  as  the  next,  and \nliberalization as the least. The study group\u2019s description of the difference in terms of priorities \nbetween an EAFTA and a CEPEA implies that an EAFTA should proceed first, followed by a \nCEPEA. This sequenced approach would be realistic. \n\nA  PRC\u2013Japan\u2013Korea  FTA.  One  of  the  most  important  preconditions  for  an  EAFTA  is  the \ncreation of either a trilateral FTA among PRC, Japan, and Korea (CJK FTA) or three bilateral \nFTAs  between  pairs  of  these  countries.  However,  differences  in  the  eagerness  of  forming \nFTAs exist among these three countries. The PRC is keen on establishing FTAs with Japan \nand Korea, but both Japan and Korea have some reservations over entering into FTAs with \nthe PRC.  \n\nThe  Japanese  government  is  concerned  about  the  rising  competitiveness  of  the  PRC\u2019s \nmanufacturing  sector  and  the  competitiveness  of  the  PRC\u2019s  agricultural  products.  Japan \nwishes to treat the PRC as a non-market economy so that it can use safeguard measures \nagainst  a  rapid  increase  of  PRC  imports  into  the  Japanese  markets,  but  the  PRC\u2019s \ngovernment insists upon market economy status for itself. Japan also argues that the PRC \nhas yet to clearly demonstrate progress toward implementation of WTO entry commitments, \nincluding  the  treatment  of  Japanese  firms  in  the  PRC,  clarity  of  regulations  and  rules  over \nfirms, and protection of intellectual property rights. Food safety issues are also a concern for \nJapan. The Japanese government has taken the position that an investment treaty should be \na first condition before starting an EPA negotiation. \n\nKorea  is  concerned  about  excessive  dependence  on  the  PRC  market  and  the  lack  of  an \noverall  policy  on  how  to  position  itself  in  terms  of  trade  and  investment  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  PRC. \nKorea is also concerned about the PRC\u2019s agricultural competitiveness.15  \n\nJapan and Korea are interested in concluding an FTA with each other, but each country has \nconcerns.  Japan\u2019s  primary  concern  over  a  Japan\u2013Korea  EPA  is  the  competitiveness  of \nKorea\u2019s  agriculture  and  fishery  sectors.  In  contrast,  Korea  is  concerned  about  Japan\u2019s \ncompetitiveness  in  manufactured  products  (intermediate  inputs),  Korea\u2019s  large  tariff \nconcessions required due to high most favored nation tariffs, and the risk of greater bilateral \ntrade deficits with Japan. \n\nDespite these problems, if the three countries can negotiate mutually agreeable FTAs, they \ncan provide a strong foundation for a possible EAFTA, and eventually a CEPEA and FTAAP. \nThis will require joint political commitment from the governments of all three countries. \n\nAn FTAAP. As with an EAFTA or CEPEA, an Asia and Pacific-wide FTA requires a series of \nplurilateral and/or bilateral agreements among key players, particularly those for the US with \nASEAN,  PRC,  and  Japan  (the  US\u2013Korea  FTA  has  been  concluded).  Given  that  the  US \nprovides the most open market for Asian products and a security umbrella for key East Asian \neconomies, the region\u2019s relationship with the US is critical, both economically and politically.  \n\nAPEC  remains  important  for  both  East  Asia  and  the  US  because  it  is  the  only  multilateral \neconomic  forum  that  bridges  the  two.  The  US  has  advocated  strengthening  economic  ties \namong  APEC  members  through  the  formation  of  an  APEC-wide  free  trade  area  (e.g.,  an \nFTAAP).  While  several  East  Asian  countries  have  concluded  bilateral  FTAs  with  the  US, \nothers have reservations about a comprehensive agreement with the US. Deeper questions \n\n                                                 \n15  Interestingly,  Korean  farmers  do  not  seem  threatened  by  the  Korea\u2013US  FTA,  but  express  concerns  on \n\nagriculture with regard to a Korea\u2013PRC FTA. \n\n \n\n23\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 144 \n \n\nKawai and Wignaraja \n\nremain as to whether the US is ready to agree to an FTA with the whole of East Asia\u2014one \nthat includes the PRC\u2014under the current political environment. \n\nAn FTAAP could increase two-way trade of partner countries in a significant way, and could \nbe  a  useful  way  of  reviving  the  stalled  Doha  Round  or  offer  a  \u201cPlan  B\u201d  hedge  should  the \nDoha Round permanently fail (Bergsten 2007; Hufbauer and Schott 2009). An FTAAP was \nproposed  for  consideration  at  the  APEC  Summits  in  2007  and  2008.  The  formation  of  an \nFTAAP  is  expected  to  take  many  years  and  involve  studies,  evaluations,  and  negotiations \namong all 21 member economies. Given that the number of APEC member economies is so \nlarge, a smaller group may be more appropriate to initiate the process (e.g., an EAFTA).  \n\nA recently emerging FTA, called the Transpacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement \n(Transpacific  SEPA),  is  attracting  a  growing  number  of  countries  sympathetic  to  its  goal  of \nhigh-standard  liberalization  (Markheim  2008).  The  Transpacific  SEPA,  also  known  as  the \nPacific  Four  (P4)  agreement,  is  a  plurilateral  FTA  among  Brunei  Darussalam,  Chile,  New \nZealand, and Singapore that came into force in May 2006.16 The aim of the agreement is to \neliminate  90%  of  all  tariffs  among  member  countries  upon  entry  into  force  and  reduce  all \ntrade  tariffs  to  zero  by  2015.  The  Transpacific  SEPA  is  a  comprehensive  agreement \ncovering  many  WTO-plus  elements,  including  ROOs,  trade  remedies,  sanitary  and \nphytosanitary  measures,  technical  barriers  to  trade,  intellectual  property,  government \nprocurement,  and  competition  policy.  As  part  of  the  conclusion  of  negotiations,  the  P4 \ncountries  agreed  to  negotiate  on  financial  services  and  investment  within  2  years  of \nTranspacific SEPA\u2019s entry into force.  \n\nThe  Transpacific  SEPA  has  the  potential  to  grow  to  include  many  other  nations  under  the \nagreement\u2019s  accession  clause.  In  September  2008,  the  US  announced  it  had  decided  to \nenter into negotiations to join the group. Australia and Peru also expressed interest in similar \nnegotiations. Thus, the Transpacific SEPA could expand and strengthen US economic and \nstrategic ties to the APEC region and could lay the foundation for a wider FTAAP.  \n\nThere are two possible avenues to creating an FTAAP: one through an EAFTA or CEPEA, \nand  the  other  through  an  expanded  Transpacific  SEPA.  However,  there  are  several \nnoteworthy  stumbling  blocks  in  pursuing  the  Transpacific  SEPA  route.  First,  APEC  is  a \nvoluntary,  non-binding  organization;  however,  forming  an  FTA  requires  the  concerned \ngovernments\u2019  binding  commitments  to  trade  liberalization,  which  means  that  this  route \nshould  be  pursued  outside  of  the  formal  APEC  process  unless  the  mandate  of  APEC \nchanges.17 Second, the Transpacific SEPA route neglects the importance of ASEAN as the \nhub  for  East  Asian  integration,  especially  given  that  not  all  ASEAN  countries  are  APEC \nmembers.  Currently,  only  Brunei  Darussalam  and  Singapore  are  Transpacific  SEPA \nmembers from ASEAN and it is highly unlikely that the other ASEAN countries that are also \nAPEC members could join the Transpacific SEPA within a reasonable time frame because \nthe agreement is a high-standard and comprehensive liberalization agreement. Third, India \nis  not  an  APEC  member  and,  therefore,  it  would  take  some  time  for  India  to  join  the \nTranspacific SEPA.  \n\nLinks  with  Europe. Though connecting East Asia with Europe is a relatively new idea, the \nEuropean Commission has already begun negotiating FTAs with ASEAN, India, and Korea. \nOnce the PRC and Japan come into this discussion, a solid foundation for an East Asia\u2013EU \nFTA (an FTAEE, or even a wider FTA among the ASEM countries) will be in place. \n\n                                                 \n16 The  Transpacific  SEPA  was  previously  known  as  the  Pacific  Three  Closer  Economic  Partnership  (P3-CEP), \n\nwith its negotiations first launched at the 2002 APEC Leaders\u2019 Summit. \n\n17 Changing  APEC\u2019s  mandate  into  a  prospective  FTA  organization,  however,  would  likely  encounter  strong \n\noppositions from many middle-income ASEAN countries. \n\n \n\n24\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 144 \n \n\nKawai and Wignaraja \n\n4.2  Likely Scenario: Sequencing of FTA Consolidation \n\nGiven the prominence of political economy considerations as they relate to ASEAN regional \neconomic  integration,  it  would  likely  be  difficult  to  expand  the  Transpacific  SEPA  to  all  of \nEast  Asia  within  a  short  period  of  time.  FTA  consolidation  in  East  Asia  is  likely  to  proceed \nalong the line of an ASEAN-centric EAFTA or CEPEA. The most likely scenario would be the \nfollowing consolidation sequence: \n\n\u2022  acceleration of an ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) to be created by 2015; \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\ncompletion of ASEAN+1 FTAs with each of the \u201cplus\u201d countries; \n\ncreation of a CJK FTA either through a PRC\u2013Japan\u2013Korea trilateral FTA or three \nbilateral FTAs among the three countries; \n\nformation  of  an  EAFTA  among  the  ASEAN+3  countries  through  mechanisms  to \nconnect the ASEAN+1 FTAs and a CJK FTA by allowing simplification, cumulation, \nand harmonization of ROOs; \n\nformation of a CEPEA by including India and Australia and New Zealand; and \n\nconnection  between  East  Asia  and  the  US  through  an  FTAAP,  and  with  Europe \nthrough an FTAAE. \n\nThe  dynamics  of  this  \u201clikely  scenario\u201d  can  evolve  over  time,  with  each  step  creating \nincentives  for  the  next  step  to  be  taken.  First,  completion  of  an  ASEAN  Economic \nCommunity (AEC) is vital to FTA consolidation in East Asia as this will strengthen ASEAN\u2019s \nability  to  play  the  region\u2019s  integration  hub  role.  Once  an  AEC  is  in  place,  ASEAN  will  be \ntransformed  into  a  much  more  coherent  entity  and,  building  on  this  strength,  can \nsubstantially improve the quality of ASEAN+1 FTAs\u2014to be formed with the \u201cplus\u201d countries \nof PRC, Japan, Korea, India, and Australia and New Zealand.  \n\nNext,  creation  of  a  CJK  FTA  (or  three  bilateral  FTAs  among  PRC,  Japan,  and  Korea)  is  a \nnecessary building block for the formation of an EAFTA because without it, integration of the \nASEAN+3  countries  through  a  formal  institutional  arrangement  is  impossible.  The  political \ndecision  by  Japan  and  the  PRC  to  form  an  FTA  (or  EPA)  is  the  cornerstone.  ASEAN  may \nplay a key role in encouraging Japan and PRC (and Korea) to agree on a Northeast Asian \nFTA. Once a CJK FTA (or at least a bilateral FTA between the PRC and Japan) is formed, it \ncan  be  connected  with  the  ASEAN+1  FTAs  through  various  mechanisms  that  allow \nsimplification,  cumulation,  and  harmonization  of  ROOs.  This  development  will  put \ncompetitive  pressures  on  India,  an  excluded  party,  to  further  liberalize so  that  India  will  be \neventually included in a larger FTA, thus forming a CEPEA.  \n\nAlong this line of sequencing, several East Asian APEC economies (e.g., Japan and Korea) \nmay  join  the  Transpacific  SEPA,  and  the  US  may  conclude  an  FTA  with  ASEAN  as  an \nASEAN+1  partner.18  Indeed,  by  that  time  the  US  and  Europe  will  likely  have  concluded  a \nseries of FTAs with several key East Asian economies so that it will be possible to eventually \nconnect the whole of East Asia with the US (possibly through an FTAAP), and with Europe \n(possibly  through  an  FTAAE).  All  of  these  nested  approaches  are  important  and  can \npotentially  accelerate  the  process  of  East  Asian  integration and,  more  broadly,  transpacific \neconomic integration.  \n\n                                                 \n18 The  US  has  joined  ASEAN\u2019s  Treaty  of  Amity  and  Cooperation,  which  is  a  significant  political  step  for  the \nrelationship  between  the  two.  This  can  lay  a  strong  foundation  for  the  US  to  become  a  legitimate  ASEAN+1 \npartner. \n\n \n\n25\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 144 \n \n\n5.  CONCLUSION \n\nKawai and Wignaraja \n\nIn  this  paper,  we  have  outlined  the  main  trends  and  challenges  associated  with  the  rapid \nspread  of  Asian  FTAs,  and  provided  new  evidence  from  firm  surveys,  analysis  of \nagreements,  and  CGE  results.  The  paper  also  considered  political  economy  issues \nassociated with FTA consolidation in Asia, and various competing proposals. The evidence \nhighlights  the  shift  in  East  Asia's  trade  policy  that  has  occurred  since  2000.  With  54 \nconcluded agreements, FTAs are assuming more importance as a tool of commercial policy \nin East Asia than ever before. A classic hub and spoke arrangement has developed whereby \nfive  large  economies  have  emerged  as  hubs  with  their  smaller  neighbors  as  spokes. \nFurthermore, the Asian FTAs have maintained a strong cross-regional orientation, the trade \ncoverage  of  FTAs  has  increased,  and  issues  other  than  trade  liberalization\u2014such  as \ninvestment, intellectual property rights, and labor issues\u2014have been included.   \n\nThe  conclusion  of  a  comprehensive  Doha  Round  Agreement  would  be  an  invaluable \ncontribution  to  Asian  prosperity.  But  the  outcome  of  the  stalled  global  trade  talks  remains \nuncertain.  With  a  large  number  of  FTAs  either  under  negotiation  or  proposed,  Asian  FTAs \nare  here  to  stay.  A  pragmatic  approach  would  be  to  maximize  the  benefits  of  FTAs  while \nminimizing  their  costs.  Based  on  the  new  evidence  presented  in  the  paper,  some  key \nelements of a pragmatic approach towards Asia\u2019s FTAs might include: \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nimproving  use  of  FTAs  at  the  firm  level  through  increased  awareness  and \nstrengthened institutional support systems, particularly for SMEs; \n\ntackling  the Asian  \u201cnoodle  bowl\u201d  problem  by  encouraging  rationalization  of  ROOs \nand upgrading ROO administration to best practice levels; \n\n\u2022  encouraging better coverage of agricultural products in Asian FTAs and a gradual \n\napproach to agricultural trade liberalization; \n\nincluding  WTO-plus  provisions\u2014particularly  the  four  Singapore  issues\u2014in  all \nfuture Asian agreements; and  \n\nfacilitating  the  creation  of  a  region-wide  agreement  in  East  Asia\u2014particularly  a \nfor  dealing  with \nCEPEA\u2014with  appropriate  sub-sequencing  and  support \ndevelopment gaps among members.  \n\nWhile  the  economic  case  for  a  region-wide  agreement  such  as  a  CEPEA  is  borne  out  by \nCGE  analysis,  political  economy  considerations  remain  likely  to  weigh  heavily  on  the  final \noutcome.  A  sequential  approach  of  first  creating  a  series  of  building  blocks  within  Asia\u2014\ndeepening  ASEAN  economic  integration,  creating  a  CJK  FTA,  and  developing  an  EAFTA \nbefore moving to a CEPEA\u2014followed by connecting Asia with the US and Europe seems the \nmost  likely  scenario.  In  conclusion,  a  bottom-up  approach  to  a  Doha  Round  Agreement \nemerges from the analysis.  \n\n \n\n26\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 144 \n \n\nAPPENDIX: TABLES \n\nKawai and Wignaraja \n\nAppendix Table 1: Profile of Integrating Asia Economies \n\nCountry \n\nGNI per Capita \n\nApplied MFN \n\nExports \n\n2007 current US$ \n(billion) \n\n2007 average \n\n2008 US$ \n(billion) \n\n% of \nworld \nexports \n\n \n\n  \nBrunei Darussalama \nCambodia \n\nHong Kong, China \n\nIndia  \n\nIndonesia \n\nJapan \n\nMalaysia \nMyanmara \nPhilippines \n\nSingapore \nTaipei,Chinab \nThailand \n\nViet Nam \n\n  \n\nChina, People's Republic of \n\n       2,370 \n\nKorea, Republic of \n\n                    19,7300 \n\nLao People\u2019s Dem.

This has sparked concerns about the negative effects of \nAsian  FTAs,  including  the  \u201cnoodle  bowl\u201d  problem.  Amid  slow  progress  in  the  World  Trade \nOrganization\u2019s  (WTO)  Doha  negotiations  and  the  global  financial  crisis,  however,  Asian \nregionalism seems to be here to stay and the focus for policymakers should be how best to \nminimize  the  costs  of  FTAs  while  maximizing  their  benefits.  Adopting  a  pragmatic \nperspective, this paper examines key trends and challenges in Asian FTAs. It provides new \nevidence  from  firm  surveys,  analysis  of  specific  agreements,  and  computable  general \nequilibrium estimates. It makes a case for strengthening the support system for using FTAs, \nrationalizing  rules  of  origin  and  upgrading  their  administration,  ensuring  better  coverage  of \nagricultural  trade,  forging  comprehensive  \u201cWTO-plus\u201d  agreements,  and  encouraging  a \nregion-wide FTA. Political economy considerations suggest that a likely scenario is for FTA \nconsolidation  in  Asia  to  be  followed  by  connections  with  North  America  and  Europe.  In \nconclusion, a bottom-up approach to a Doha Round Agreement emerges from the analysis.  \n", "JEL Classification: F1, F15, and O24 \n", " \n"]}
