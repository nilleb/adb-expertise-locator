INTRODUCTION \nThe recent advent of free trade agreements (FTAs) will likely have a marked impact on \nAsia\u2019s trade policy and its cherished status as the global factory. This paper deals with the \nspread  of  FTAs  in  economically  important  Asia  since  2000,  including  the  current  FTA \nlandscape, challenges FTAs pose for business and public policy, and what might be done to \nmake Asian FTAs more multilateral friendly.  \nThree recent and interrelated developments provide the context for this chapter:  \nFirst, Asia\u2019s advanced production networks, which underlie its spectacular global export \nsuccess over the past several decades, have deepened regionally (Kimura 2006; Asian \nDevelopment Bank [ADB] 2008). Production networks have been broken into smaller steps, \nwith  each  step  in  the  most  cost-effective  location,  thereby  further  improving  efficiency. \nFalling regional trade barriers and logistics costs, along with technological progress, underlie \nthis trend. Intraregional trade in Asia has increased significantly, particularly in parts and \ncomponents, and this trend may continue with further regional liberalization via FTAs. \nSecond, East Asia\u2014a relative latecomer to using FTAs as a trade policy instrument\u2014is now \nat the forefront of global FTA activity with 54 concluded FTAs. The Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) is emerging as the hub for Asia\u2019s FTAs, with other major Asian \neconomies  joining  the  FTA  bandwagon.  Policy  support  for  the  deeper  integration  of \nproduction networks, regional integration efforts in other major markets, and the 1997\u20131998 \nAsian financial crisis have spurred the growth of Asian FTAs (Urata 2004; Kawai 2005). With \nmany more FTAs currently under negotiation, there is little sign of a diminishing appetite for \nFTAs in Asia. \nThird,  there  is  emerging  literature on  the  economic  effects  of  Asian  FTAs.  Issues  and \nconcerns highlighted in the new literature include little use of FTA preferences, a \"noodle \nbowl\" problem of criss-crossing agreements that potentially distort trade toward bilateral \nchannels, excessive exclusions and special treatment in FTAs, and the possibility that the \nmultilateral trading system may be progressively eroded (Baldwin 2006; Bhagwati 2008). \nFTAs  are  a  relatively  new  phenomenon  in  Asia  and  a  dearth  of  empirical  evidence, \nparticularly with respect to patterns of Asian FTAs and business impacts, has made it difficult \nto verify the validity of these concerns. With the availability of new data, the time is ripe for \nan evidence-based assessment of Asian FTAs.  \nAmid the economic downturn following the global financial crisis and the stalled World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) Doha negotiations, regionalism and FTAs in Asia are likely to persist as \na means to promote liberalization. Liberalizing trade regionally, as opposed to globally, may \nbe easier to achieve because fewer parties are involved. Moreover, regional agreements \nmay be able to extend further in key policy areas. Accordingly, business will need to learn to \nexport more effectively under a regional trade regime anchored on FTAs. The focus for \npolicymakers  is  how  best  to  minimize  the  costs  of  Asian  FTAs  (e.g.,  transactions  and \nadministrative costs) while maximizing their benefits (e.g., preferential tariffs, better market \naccess, and new business opportunities.)  \nAdopting a pragmatic perspective, this paper examines trends and challenges in Asian FTAs \nwith a view to making suggestions. Section II summarizes Asia's emergence as the global \nfactory through outward-oriented development strategies and highlights the region's recent \nemphasis on FTAs. It charts major trends in Asian FTAs since 2000, including growth, hubs \nand spokes, cross-regional orientation, and trade coverage. Section III analyses five key \nchallenges posed by Asian FTAs: (i) improving firm-level use of FTAs, (ii) tackling the Asian \n\u201cnoodle bowl\u201d problem, (iii) promoting comprehensive coverage of agricultural trade, (iv) \nincreasing \u201cWTO-plus\u201d elements, and (v) forming a region-wide FTA. New evidence from \nanalysis of FTAs, firm surveys, and computable general equilibrium (CGE) models is used to \naddress  these  challenges.  In  response  to  increasing  interest  in  forming  a  region-wide \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 144  Kawai and Wignaraja \n \nagreement, Section IV explores political economy issues as they relate to FTA consolidation \nin East Asia and its potential connection with North America and Europe. In conclusion, \nSection V advocates strengthening the support system for regional production networks, \nforging comprehensive WTO-plus agreements, and encouraging an East Asia-wide FTA. A \nbottom-up approach to a WTO Doha Round Agreement emerges from the analysis.  \nFor  the  purposes  of  this  paper,  the  term  \u201cAsia\u201d  is  narrowly  used  to  describe  the  16 \neconomies  that  make  up  \u201cintegrating  Asia,\u201d  while  the  term  \u201cdeveloping  Asia\u201d  excludes \nJapan.1 \n2.  TRENDS IN ASIAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS \n2.1  Emergence of the Global Factory \nThe story of developing Asia\u2019s spectacular rise from a poor underdeveloped agricultural \nbackwater to become the global factory over a 50-year period is regarded as an economic \nmiracle (Stiglitz 1996). In the 1960s, developing Asian economies lacked natural resources \nand  had  high  levels  of  poverty.  There  seemed  to  be  little  prospect  of  economic \nadvancement. Nonetheless, Asian economies had ample supplies of inexpensive, productive \nmanpower. They were also geographically close to an expanding high-income Japan, with \nefficient multinational corporations (MNCs) seeking to relocate production to less costly \nlocations in East Asia. Multilateralism through the WTO framework and its predecessor, the \nGeneral Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT), and open regionalism\u2014supported by \nunilateral  liberalization\u2014centered  on  Asia\u2013Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  (APEC), \nunderpinned Asia\u2019s approach to international trade policy for several decades. FTAs were \nabsent both internationally and in Asia. International trade policy at the national level was \nanchored by outward-oriented development strategies, high domestic savings rates, creation \nof strong infrastructure, and investment in human capital. A booming world economy hungry \nfor labor-intensive imports from Asia, falling tariffs in developed country markets, inflows of \ntrade-related foreign direct investment (FDI), and generous foreign aid flows also favored \noutward-oriented growth in Asia.  \nA long period of market-driven expansion of trade and FDI followed, during which Asia \nincreasingly became the global factory. Through strategies of innovation and learning, Asian \nfirms acquired the requisite technological capabilities to either compete internationally or \nbecome suppliers to MNCs (Hobday 1995; Mathews and Cho 2000; Wignaraja 2008). This \ninvolved developing production engineering skills to use imported technologies efficiently \nand successfully plugging into the advanced global production networks formed by MNCs \nand local suppliers. As systematic innovation and learning took place at the firm level, a shift \nfrom labor-intensive exports (e.g., textiles, garments, and footwear) to more technology-\nintensive exports (e.g., chemicals, ships, electronics, and automobiles) occurred in Asia. \nSome Asian firms built deep innovative capabilities based on investments in research and \ndevelopment, emerging as leading firms in production networks and supply chains. Rising \neconomic prosperity in Asia followed in the wake of rapid industrialization. As a result, three \nof the world's richest economies are now in Asia: Japan, Republic of Korea (hereafter \nKorea), and Singapore. \nIn  addition,  intraregional  concentration  of  trade  and  FDI  activities  rose  as  production \nnetworks involving Asian firms deepened regionally (Kimura 2006). Rising factor costs in \ncore production locations were a prime driver. Falling regional trade barriers and logistics \ncosts, as well as technological progress, spurred the decentralization of production networks \n                                                 \n1  Integrating Asia includes Brunei Darussalam; Cambodia; People\u2019s Republic of China; Hong Kong, China; India; \nIndonesia; Japan; Republic of Korea; Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; Malaysia; Myanmar; Philippines; \nSingapore; Taipei,China; Thailand; and Viet Nam. See Appendix Table 1 for basic economic statistics of the \neconomies in Integrating Asia. \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 144  Kawai and Wignaraja \n \nto the most cost-effective locations. Accordingly, trade within Asia increased significantly \nfrom  37%  of  total  trade  to  54%  between  1980  and  2007,  led  by  trade  in  parts  and \ncomponents (ADB 2008). Toward the turn of the 20th century, this simple story of outward \norientation  and  export  success  was  punctuated  by  a  change  in  the  nature  of  Asia\u2019s \ninternational trade policy toward FTAs.  \n2.2  Growth of FTAs \nAlongside multilateralism, Asia began emphasizing FTAs as a trade policy instrument in the \nlate 1990s and the region is today at the forefront of world FTA activity (Feridhanusetyawan \n2005; Fiorentino, Crawford, and Toqueboeuf 2009). Appendix Table 2 provides data from \nthe ADB FTA Database on the number of concluded FTAs in Asia between 2000 and 2009 \n(as of June 2009). The number of concluded FTAs in Asia as a group increased from only 3 \nto 54 during that time. Of these, 40 FTAs are currently in effect. The proliferation of FTAs in \nAsia is likely to be sustained: another 78 are either under negotiation or proposed. Asia is \nahead of the Americas in FTAs per country\u2014on average Asia has 3.4 concluded FTAs per \ncountry compared with 2.2 for the Americas.2 On the whole, Asia seems to be opting for \nbilateral  agreements  rather  than  more  complex  plurilateral  ones  because  bilateral \nagreements may be easier to negotiate. Bilateral FTAs comprise 74% of the concluded \nFTAs, with plurilateral FTAs comprising the remainder. \nFour main factors underlie the recent spread of FTA initiatives in Asia: (i) deepening market-\ndriven economic integration in Asia, (ii) European and North American economic integration, \n(iii)  the  1997\u20131998  Asian  financial  crisis,  and  (iv)  slow  progress  in  the  WTO  Doha \nnegotiations.3 \nFirst  among  these  is  market-driven  economic  integration  through  trade,  FDI,  and  the \nformation of East Asian production networks and supply chains. Market-driven economic \nintegration has begun to require further liberalization of trade and FDI and harmonization of \npolicies,  rules,  and  standards  governing  trade  and  FDI.  East  Asia\u2019s  policymakers  are \nincreasingly of the view that FTAs, if given wide scope, can support expanding trade and FDI \nactivities through further elimination of cross-border impediments, facilitation of trade and \nFDI,  and  other  such  harmonization  efforts.  Thus,  FTAs  can  be  regarded  as  part  of  a \nsupporting policy framework for deepening production networks and supply chains formed \nby global MNCs and emerging Asian firms. \nSecond, European and North American economic regionalism\u2014including European Union \n(EU) expansion into central and eastern Europe, a monetary union in the eurozone, the \nsuccess of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and incipient moves toward \na Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA)\u2014has motivated East Asian FTAs. Governments \nfear that the two giant trading blocs of Europe and North America might dominate rule-\nsetting in the global trading system, thereby marginalizing Asia. Increasingly, policymakers \nhave realized the need for stepping up the pace of integration to improve international \ncompetitiveness by exploiting economies of scale and strengthening their bargaining power \nthrough a collective voice on global trade issues. FTAs can help insure against the periodic \ndifficulties of multilateral trade liberalization, such as the recent slow progress in the WTO \nDoha negotiations and a perceived loss of steam in the APEC process.  \nThird, the 1997\u20131998 Asian financial crisis made it clear that East Asian economies needed \nto work together in the area of trade and investment in order to sustain growth and stability \nby addressing common challenges. This need has not yet been fully met by either regional \ninitiatives  to  strengthen  the  international  economic  system  or  by  national  efforts  to \n                                                 \n2  According to the Organization of American States, its 34 members (including the US and Canada) had 75 \nconcluded FTAs in early December 2008 (www.sice.oas.org). This compares with 16 Asian countries with 54 \nconcluded FTAs.  \n3  More complete explanations can be found in Kawai (2005 and 2007) and ADB (2008).  \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 144  Kawai and Wignaraja \n \nstrengthen individual economies\u2019 fundamentals, both of which will take time to bear fruit. \nWith the proliferation of FTA initiatives in the region, a number of countries have begun to \njump on the bandwagon of these initiatives out of fear of exclusion. \nFourth, slow progress in the WTO Doha negotiations encouraged countries to consider FTAs \nas an alternative. Hailed as a development round to promote trade-led growth in poor \ncountries, the WTO Doha Development Round began in November 2001. The talks have \nlargely focused on liberalization in two key areas: agriculture and non-agricultural market \naccess. In essence, developed countries were being asked to accelerate the pace and \nscope of reductions in agricultural tariffs and subsidies, and developing countries were being \nasked to do the same with regard to tariffs for industrial goods. Seven years of formal \nnegotiations eventually stalled in mid-2008 over concerns in developing countries about \nsafeguard  measures  to  protect  poor  farmers  from  rising  food  and  oil  prices.  However, \ndiscussions have continued behind the scenes. As prospects for an early deal diminished \nover time, pro-business Asian countries emphasized bilateral and plurilateral FTAs for the \ncontinued liberalization of trade in goods and services, as well as the adoption of the \nSingapore  issues  (i.e.,  trade  facilitation,  investment,  government  procurement,  and \ncompetition policy), which are currently beyond the scope of the WTO.  \n2.3  FTA Hubs and Spokes \nFTA  activity  in  Asia  over  the  last  decade  has  given  rise  to  a  classic  hub  and  spoke \narrangement (Hufbauer and Schott 2009). As Figure 1 shows, the region's five largest \neconomies have become key hubs of FTA activity, while smaller neighbors have emerged as \nspokes. The number of concluded FTAs includes Singapore (18), Japan (11), People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC)  (10),  India  (9),  and  Korea  (6),  with  many  more  FTAs  under \nnegotiation. It is noteworthy that ASEAN\u2014with one of the oldest trade agreements in Asia\u2014\nis  emerging  as  a  major  regional  hub  linking ASEAN  members  with  the  region\u2019s  larger \neconomies. Having enacted FTAs with PRC, Japan, and Korea, ASEAN recently concluded \nnegotiations on bilateral agreements with India and Australia and New Zealand, and is \nconsidering negotiating an FTA with the EU. The development of FTA hubs and spokes in \nAsia can be related to several factors, including economic size, per capita income, levels of \nprotection, economic geography, and the production network strategies of MNCs.  \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 144  Kawai and Wignaraja \n \nFigure 1: Growth of Concluded FTAs in Integrating Asia \n(Number of FTAs by Country) \n2000 2009\n15\n10\n5\n0\nBrunei Darussalam Cambodia PRC g Kong, China India Indonesia Japan Korea, Rep. of Lao PDR Malaysia Myanmar Philippines Singapore Taipei,China Thailand Viet Nam\nn\no\nH\n \nADB = Asian Development Bank; FTA = free trade agreement; Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; PRC = \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. \nNote: FTAs in Integrating Asia covers all FTAs with at least one integrating Asia member country.   \nSource: ADB\u2019s Asia Regional Integration Center (ARIC) FTA Database (www.aric.adb.org), data as of June 2009. \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 144  Kawai and Wignaraja \n \nSingapore is by far the most active Asian economy in terms of the number and geographic \ncoverage of FTAs. With its strategic location, the region's most open economy, and world-\nclass infrastructure and logistics, the country is the regional headquarters for many leading \nMNCs. Singapore is seeking access to new overseas markets, particularly for services and \ninvestments.  \nThe  country  is  a  founding  member  of  the  ASEAN  Free  Trade  Area  (AFTA)  and  has \nimplemented  or  concluded  agreements  with  the  largest  Asian  economies\u2014PRC,  India, \nJapan, and Korea\u2014as well as economies outside the region, including the United States \n(US) and Australia. The US\u2013Singapore FTA, which has been in effect since 2004, was the \nfirst such agreement made by the US in Asia and is reputed to be a model agreement in \nterms of scope.  \nAs a supporter of multilateralism, Japan was a latecomer to FTAs (Urata 2004). The region's \nfirst  developed  economy  has  the  strongest base  of  giant  MNCs  involved  in  production \nnetworks and supply chains throughout Asia. One motivation for Japan's engagement in \nFTAs is to provide a market-friendly and predictable regional business environment for its \nMNCs. Japan has rapidly implemented bilateral economic partnership agreements (EPAs) \nwith nine countries4 and an agreement with ASEAN, and is negotiating agreements with \nAustralia, India, and Korea.  \nThe two Asian giant economies, the PRC and India, are forming FTAs to ensure market \naccess for goods and expand regional coverage for outward investment. To this end, the \nPRC implemented separate FTAs on goods and services with ASEAN and is now finalizing \nits  negotiations  on  an  investment  agreement.  The  PRC  has  also  forged  bilateral \ncomprehensive economic partnership agreements (CEPAs) with Hong Kong, China and \nMacau Special Administrative Region of the People\u2019s Republic of China; FTAs with Chile \nand Pakistan; and is a member of the Asia\u2013Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA). In 2008, the \nPRC concluded FTAs with Singapore and New Zealand. India is a member of APTA and has \na comprehensive agreement with Singapore. It also has agreements with its South Asian \nneighbors.  \nKorea has agreements with members of APTA and ASEAN, and Singapore within East Asia; \nand with Chile and the European Free Trade Area (EFTA) countries outside East Asia. It \nalso signed an agreement with Asia\u2019s largest trading partner, the US, in June 2007.  \nWith some exceptions, the region\u2019s poorer economies\u2014Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic (Lao PDR), Viet Nam, Philippines, and Indonesia\u2014have tended to rely on ASEAN \nfor concluding FTAs with the region\u2019s larger economies. This may reflect weak institutional \ncapacity, lack of resources, and limited leverage to undertake FTA negotiations in poorer \neconomies. The ASEAN framework offers the possibility of pooling scarce capacity and \nresources. \nMiddle-income  countries  such  as  Malaysia  and  Thailand  have  emerged  as  regional \nproduction hubs for the auto and electronics industries, respectively. As one of the founding \nmembers of ASEAN, Thailand has entered into agreements with PRC, India, Japan, and \nAustralia and New Zealand.  \nThe geographical orientation of Asian FTAs is summarized in Figure 2. A high degree of \ncross-regional  orientation  among  some  of  the  region's  stronger  economies  is  visible\u2014\nnotably for PRC; India; Korea; Singapore; and Taipei,China. The trend toward cross-regional \nFTAs is even more evident in Asia's proposed FTAs and those under negotiation (see \nAppendix Table 3 for details). It appears that Asia has a strong preference to maintain open \ntrading relations with the rest of the world rather than becoming inward-looking (Kawai \n2005). \n                                                 \n4 Brunei Darussalam, Chile, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n  8", "ADBI Working Paper 144  Kawai and Wignaraja \n \nFigure 2: Geographical Orientation and Share of Concluded FTAs in Integrating \nAsia\u2014FTAs within Integrating Asia and Cross-Regionally \n(Number of FTAs) \n20\nWithin Integrating Asia Cross-Regionally\n18\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\nnei Darussalam Cambodia PRC ng Kong, China India Indonesia Japan Korea, Rep. of Lao PDR Malaysia Myanmar Philippines Singapore Taipei,China Thailand Viet Nam\nu o\nBr H\n \nADB = Asian Development Bank; FTA = free trade agreement; Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; PRC = \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. \nNote: FTAs within Integrating Asia cover FTAs where all partners are in integrating Asia.  \nSource: ADB\u2019s Asia Regional Integration Center (ARIC) FTA Database (www.aric.adb.org), data as of June 2009. \n2.4  Trade Coverage of FTAs \nThe numbers of FTAs are relatively easy to track over time, but by themselves the numbers \ndo not indicate the importance of FTAs to economic activity or trade at the national level. It is \ninformative to get an idea of how much of a country\u2019s world trade is covered by FTA \nprovisions.5 This is difficult to measure because of exceptions and exclusions contained in \nmany agreements. Furthermore, official statistics on utilization rates of FTA preferences in \nAsia are hard to come by and published data on the direction of services trade do not exist. \nNevertheless, by making the bold assumption that all goods trade is covered by concluded \nFTAs, indicative estimates can be obtained.6 Accordingly, Figure 3 shows the share of an \neconomy\u2019s bilateral trade with its FTA partners in its total trade with the world for 2000 and \n2008. Two points are worth noting: \nFirst, the region's larger economies have smaller shares in 2008 than ASEAN members, \nhighlighting the latter\u2019s greater reliance on FTAs, especially AFTA. The shares for the large \neconomies are: Korea (44%), PRC (25%), India (23%), and Japan (11%). There is some \ndiversity within ASEAN, with Brunei Darussalum and Lao PDR having shares in excess of \n                                                 \n5 On this point, see Fiorentino, Crawford, and Toqueboeuf (2009). \n6 We are grateful for Richard Baldwin for this suggestion.  \n  9", "ADBI Working Paper 144  Kawai and Wignaraja \n \n75%, and Singapore, Malaysia, and Myanmar over 50%, while others range between 35% \nand 49%.7 Meanwhile, Taipei,China has the lowest trade coverage by FTAs at 1%. \nSecond, all Asian countries experienced a significant increase in reliance on FTAs between \n2000 and 2008, reflecting the spread of FTAs throughout the region.

CHALLENGES POSED BY ASIAN FREE TRADE \nAGREEMENTS \nAs FTAs have spread across Asia, concerns over such agreements have increased. A \ncursory analysis of the growing number of political debates, media stories, policy studies, \nand conference reports on Asian FTAs indicates that a host of challenges exist for regional \nintegration. It is not possible in this short paper to address all the economic, political, and \nlegal issues arising from the subject of integration. From a pragmatic perspective and with a \nview to making suggestions, five key challenges associated with Asian FTAs merit further \nexamination:  (i)  improving  firm-level  use  of  FTAs,  (ii)  tackling  the  Asian  \u201cnoodle  bowl\u201d \nproblem, (iii) promoting comprehensive coverage of agricultural trade, (iv) increasing WTO-\nplus elements, and (v) forming a region-wide FTA. New evidence from firm surveys, analysis \nof agreements, and CGE models can be useful in addressing some of these challenges and \nindicating the way forward. \n                                                 \n7 In Singapore's case, the high ratio reflects a proactive strategy of concluding a large number of bilateral and \nASEAN FTAs. In Lao PDR and Brunei Darussalam, this ratio may suggest high commodity dependence and \nmarket concentration in a limited export base. \n  10", "ADBI Working Paper 144  Kawai and Wignaraja \n \n3.1  Challenge 1: Improving Firm-Level Use of FTA Preferences \nImproving  preference  use  at  the  firm  level  is  probably  the  most  important  challenge \nassociated with Asian FTAs. Well designed and comprehensive FTAs provide numerous \nbenefits, including preferential tariffs, market access, and new business opportunities. One \nmight assume that firms would desire to avail of such benefits once a given FTA is in effect. \nPrevious studies at the country and industry levels, however, suggest that FTA preference \nutilization rates\u2014based on shares of export value enjoying preferences\u2014are low in East \nAsian countries and that FTAs are underutilized (Baldwin 2006; World Bank 2007). A firm-\nlevel study of Japan's FTAs also reported modest preference utilization rates and related this \nto  the  low  volume  of  trade  with  FTA  partner  countries  (Takahashi  and  Urata  2008). \nAccordingly, Asian FTAs are often viewed as discriminatory and a drain on scarce trade \nnegotiation capacity in developing countries (Bhagwati 2008).  \nFive comprehensive surveys of exporting firms conducted in 2007\u20132008 by ADB and several \npartners in Japan, Korea, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand shed light on the use of FTA \npreferences.8  Although  data  on  shares  of  export  value  enjoying  preferences  were  not \navailable  from  the  enterprise  surveys,  it  was  possible  to  estimate  utilization  of  FTA \npreferences based on the incidence of firms\u2014i.e., the share of sample firms in a given \ncountry\u2014that use FTA preferences. Figure 4 shows this measure for firms that use and plan \nto use FTAs. East Asian exporting firms tend to utilize FTA preferences more frequently than \npreviously thought and may even be increasing their utilization rate. Of the 609 East Asian \nsample firms, 22% use FTA preferences. When plans for using FTA preferences are also \nfactored in, 44% of all East Asian firms either use or plan to use FTA preferences. Japanese \nand Thai firms are the highest users of FTA preferences, while firms from Korea, Philippines, \nand Singapore make relatively less use of preferences. Plans for heightened preference use \nare present in all five countries\u2014in particular Korea, Japan, and Thailand. While these \nfindings are encouraging, room for improvement exists in FTA preference use at the firm \nlevel.  \n                                                 \n8 For an overview of the firm surveys, see Kawai and Wignaraja (2009b). The firm surveys for the individual \ncountries will be published by ADBI as working papers and later as a book.  \n  11", "ADBI Working Paper 144  Kawai and Wignaraja \n \nFigure 4: Utilization of FTA Preferences  \n(% of Respondents) \nUse FTA  Use or Plan to Use FTA\n60\n54.2\n50 47.4\n45.7\n40.7\n40\n29.0 28.0\n30\n24.9\n20.8\n20.0\n17.3\n20\n10\n0\nJapan Singapore Korea, Rep. of Thailand Philippines\n \nFTA = free trade agreement. \nSource: Kawai and Wignaraja (2009b). \nT-tests indicate that the most striking difference between FTA preference users and non-\nusers in East Asian countries is a significant difference in firm size. Japan stands out for its \nbase  of  large  multinational  corporations.  The  average  number  of  employees  among \nJapanese firms using FTA preferences is 30,104, while this number is 1,098 in Singapore, \n591 in Thailand, and 395 in the Philippines. The average number of employees among non-\nusers is 7,020 in Japan, 291 in Thailand, 269 in the Philippines, and 142 in Singapore. \nAccordingly, a classic firm size effect seems to underlie the pattern of FTA preference use in \nthe East Asian sample. The results suggest that using FTAs entails large fixed costs\u2014e.g., \nlearning about FTA provisions, tailoring business plans to complex tariff schedules, and \nobtaining certificates  of  origin\u2014and  larger  firms  are  better  able  to muster  the requisite \nfinancial and human resources than small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).  \nThe  reasons  that  the  majority  of  East  Asian  sample  firms  do  not  currently  use  FTA \npreferences are not widely known. The ADB surveys generated responses from 325 East \nAsian sample firms on the reasons for non-use of FTA preferences. Surprisingly, a lack of \ninformation on FTAs is the most significant reason for non-use of preferences as reported by \n45% of firms surveyed. Low margins of preference (26%) and delays and administrative \ncosts associated with rules of origin (25%) were the second and third most common reasons \ncited. Other notable reasons for non-use include: use of other schemes such as export \nprocessing zones and the Information Technology Agreement for exporters, which also \nprovide incentives for exporters (11%), and non-tariff measures in partner countries (9%) \nthat inhibit exports and, hence, use of FTA preferences.  \nAccordingly, use of FTA preferences can be encouraged by raising awareness of (i) FTA \nprovisions, including phasing out tariff schedules; (ii) margins of preference at product level; \nand (iii) administrative procedures for rules of origin (ROOs). Business associations and \ngovernments could make information on how to use FTAs more transparent, particularly for \nSMEs. Practical ideas include frequent seminars with SMEs, television programs directed at \nbusinesses, and dedicated websites and telephone help lines. More generally, institutional \n  12", "ADBI Working Paper 144  Kawai and Wignaraja \n \nsupport  systems  for  businesses,  particularly  for  SMEs,  need  to  be  improved.  Existing \nsupport  systems  for  exporting  under  FTAs  are  of  varying  quality  and  take-up  rates. \nSignificant public and private investment is required in East Asia to improve coverage of \nsupport services, upgrade service quality, and reduce bureaucratic impediments to service \nuse.  Business  and  industry  associations  will  have  to  play  a  greater  role  in  providing \nmembers  with  support  services  for  exporting  under  FTAs.  Attention  might  focus  on \nupgrading  the  technical  standards,  quality,  and  productivity  of  SMEs  so  that  they  can \nparticipate more fully in regional production networks driven by large firms.  \n3.2  Challenge 2: Tackling the Asian \u201cNoodle Bowl\u201d Problem \nROOs are another potentially challenging aspect of Asian FTAs. These are devices to \ndetermine which goods will enjoy preferential tariffs in order to prevent trade deflection \namong FTA members. For manufactured goods, ROOs comprise three types: (i) a change in \ntariff classification rule defined at a detailed harmonized system level; (ii) a local (or regional) \nvalue content rule, which requires a product to satisfy a minimum local (or regional) value in \nthe country (or region) of an FTA; and (iii) a specific process rule, which requires a specific \nproduction process for an item (Estevadeordal and Suominen 2006). An influential strand of \nliterature argues that Asian FTAs have complicated ROOs, sparking concerns about what \nthe attendant rules and administrative procedures would imply for the cost of doing business \n(Manchin  and  Pelkmans-Balaoing  2007;  Tumbarello  2007).  This  literature  claims  that \nrestrictive ROOs in Asian FTAs deter the use of FTA preferences, while complex ROOs \nraise transactions costs for firms. With the rapid spread of FTAs throughout Asia, this \nliterature further suggests that multiple ROOs in overlapping FTAs pose a severe burden on \nSMEs, which have less ability to meet such costs. Originally termed a \u201cspaghetti bowl\u201d of \ntrade deals (Bhagwati 1995), this phenomenon has become widely known as the \u201cnoodle \nbowl\u201d effect in Asia. Others suggest that the depiction of Asian FTAs as a complicated \nnoodle bowl is misleading. On the contrary, it has been argued that Asian FTAs may be \ncreating an order of a different sort by building the foundation for a stronger regional trading \nsystem (Petri 2008).  \nTo what extent are multiple ROOs perceived as a problem by businesses in Asia? The ADB \nfirm surveys provide interesting insights into this issue. Specifically, the surveys provide \nenterprise perceptions of whether dealing with multiple ROOs in the region\u2019s FTAs would \nsignificantly add to business costs. The main findings suggested by the surveys are given \nbelow. \nFirst, at the present level of concluded FTAs in the region, the evidence suggests that \nmultiple  ROOs  impose  a  limited  burden  on  firms  in  East  Asia.  Of  the  465  firms  that \nresponded  to  the  question  on  this  issue,  124  firms  (27%)  said  that  multiple  ROOs  do \nsignificantly add to business costs. Meanwhile, the bulk of the sample firms did not think that \nthey were a problem at present. However, the aggregate figure masks interesting country-\nlevel  variations  in  perceptions.  Singaporean  firms  had  the  most  negative  perceptions \nregarding multiple ROOs (38%), while Korean firms had the least negative perceptions \n(15%). In between these two extremes were Japanese, Philippine, and Thai firms with \nnegative responses of 31%, 28%, and 26%, respectively. National FTA strategies, industrial \nstructures, and the quality of institutional support may underlie differences in perceptions of \nROOs across Asian countries.  \nSecond, the surveys suggest that larger firms in Asia have more negative perceptions of \nmultiple ROOs than SMEs, which was an unexpected finding (Figure 5). The relationship \nbetween firm size and concerns about multiple ROOs presents an interesting puzzle for \nresearch. Econometric analysis to resolve the puzzle shows that large established firms tend \nto  export  to  multiple  markets  and  change  their  business  plans  in  response  to  FTAs. \nTherefore, they are more likely to complain about issues of multiple ROOs (Kawai and \nWignaraja 2009b). In contrast, smaller firms tend to export to a single market and hence do \n  13", "ADBI Working Paper 144  Kawai and Wignaraja \n \nnot have much basis for complaining. While inter-country and intra-firm size variations exist, \nthere does not seem to be much variation in perceptions across sectors.  \nFigure 5: Burden Imposed by Multiple Rules of Origin in FTAs \n(% of Respondents by Firm Size) \n70.0\n60.0 SME Large Giant\n50.0\n40.0\n30.0\n20.0\n10.0\n0.0\nAll Firms Japan Singapore Thailand Philippines\n \n   \nFTA = free trade agreement; SME = small- and medium-sized enterprise. \nNote: SME = 100 or fewer employees, Large = 101 to 1,000 employees, Giant = more than 1,000 employees.  \nSource: Kawai and Wignaraja (2009b). \nThird, most firms want to be able to choose between ROOs included in FTAs. The surveys \nsuggest that firms are supportive of having alternative ROOs for the same product for \nseveral reasons: (i) if they cannot reach the value content requirement, having another ROO \nenables them to avail of FTA preferences; (ii) as the application for the value content rule \nmay require confidential information on costs, suppliers and many firms are often reluctant to \ndivulge such information; and (iii) some ROOs may be better aligned with the technology \nand production process of particular industries.  \nThe finding of a limited burden imposed by multiple ROOs does not mean that policymakers \nshould be complacent about the issue. As the number of concluded agreements increases, it \nis  possible  that  multiple  ROOs  may  become  more  of  a  problem  for  firms.  Supportive \nmeasures\u2014such  as  encouraging  rationalization  of  ROOs  and  upgrading  their \nadministration\u2014are needed to mitigate the negative effects of the Asian noodle bowl in the \nfuture. Widespread gains are possible from pursuing a simplified approach to ROOs in East \nAsia involving harmonized ROOs, cumulation of value contents, and coequality of ROOs. \nLikewise, adoption of international good practices in ROO administration would be useful. \nThis may include introduction of a trusted trader program, as is the case with NAFTA, that \nwould allow successful applicants to self-certify their own certificates of origin, a switch to \nbusiness associations issuing certificates of origin for a fee, increased use of information \ntechnology-based systems of ROO administration, and training programs for SMEs. \n  14", "ADBI Working Paper 144  Kawai and Wignaraja \n \n3.3  Challenge 3: Promoting Comprehensive Coverage of \nAgricultural Trade \nA third potential challenge for Asian FTAs may be the extent of coverage of goods trade. \nSome suggest that the coverage of goods trade differs markedly among Asian FTAs, while \nagricultural products are largely excluded due to pressures from powerful farm lobbies or \nsocial concerns over the rural sector, where poverty is predominant in developing countries \n(Feridhanusetyawan  2005).  As  a  result,  there  is  a  sub-optimal  level  of  liberalization  in \nagricultural products and even conflict with the spirit of GATT article XXIV, which provides \nexemption  to  the  WTO's  most  favored  nation  clause,  or  nondiscriminatory  treatment. \nConsistency  with  GATT  article  XXIV  requires  FTAs  to  eliminate  trade  barriers  on \n\u201csubstantially all trade\u201d in originating goods from members within a reasonable period of \ntime, which is sometimes referred to as the \u201csubstantially all trade\u201d rule. \nTwo problems have hampered empirical research on the coverage of agricultural goods \ntrade in Asian FTAs. First, little systematic data and analysis is available on the treatment of \nagricultural products across Asian FTAs. Second, clear criteria for the \u201csubstantially all trade\u201d \nrule do not seem to exist. With the development of new databases on Asian FTAs\u2014e.g., \nADB\u2019s  Asia  Regional  Integration  Center  database\u2014new  sources  of  FTA  data  are  now \navailable. Furthermore, tariff lines for agricultural products can be used as a basis to gauge \nthe criteria of substantially all trade.  \nA simple three-fold classification system was used to categorize Asian FTAs according to \ntariff line coverage of agricultural products. Given the complexity of provisions for agriculture \nin many agreements, and the availability of tariff schedules and exclusion lists at the product \nlevel, a combination of coverage of product lines and exclusions was used to assess each \nagreement. The classifications are as follows:  \n\u2022  Comprehensive coverage\u2014at least 85% of all agricultural product lines in a given \nagreement are covered, or not more than 150 product lines are excluded. FTAs \nwith these features for agricultural products are taken as covering substantially all \ntrade.  \n\u2022  No  or  limited  coverage\u2014agricultural  products  are  completely  excluded  in  the \nagreement, or less than 100 product lines are included. \n\u2022  Some  coverage\u2014more  agricultural  products  are  included  in  FTAs  than \n\u201ccomprehensive  coverage,\u201d  but  less  products  are  covered  than  \u201cno  or  limited \ncoverage.\u201d  Agreements  with  such  coverage  typically  include  more  than  100 \nagricultural product lines, but less than 85% of agricultural product lines. These \nagreements may also exclude over 150 agricultural product lines. \nIt was possible to apply this classification system to 50 concluded Asian FTAs9 and the \nresults are shown in Figure 6. Some examples may be illustrative. For example, the Korea\u2013\nChile FTA is taken as a comprehensive agreement for agricultural goods as Korea excludes \nonly 21 agricultural products from the agreement, including rice, apples, and pears. ASEAN \nis also regarded as a comprehensive agreement as members exclude only 20 agricultural \nproducts on average.10 The ASEAN\u2013Australia and New Zealand FTA follows the AFTA \nmodel where most tariffs on agricultural products are bound at 0% upon the FTA's entry into \nforce or phased to 0% by 2020. Exclusions from tariff commitments have been kept to a \nminimum including rice, sugar, and maize. Using this approach, 25 Asian FTAs (50% of the \ntotal) can be regarded as comprehensive in terms of coverage of agricultural products, while \n                                                 \n9 The data exclude four agreements involving Latin American countries for which texts were not available in \nEnglish.  \n10 Accordingly, Lao PDR excludes 5 items, Viet Nam 7, Malaysia 16, Philippines 17, Indonesia 24, and Cambodia \nand Myanmar 36 each. In contrast, Brunei Darussalam and Singapore eliminated tariffs on all agricultural \nproducts.  \n  15", "ADBI Working Paper 144  Kawai and Wignaraja \n \nanother 13 (26%) have some coverage of these items (see Appendix Table 4 for examples \nof FTAs with substantial coverage of agricultural products). The remaining 12 (24%) have \nlimited or no coverage. Additional work is needed to refine the criteria for assessing the \ncoverage of agricultural products in Asian FTAs according to the \u201csubstantially all trade\u201d rule \nand to develop new criteria based on the value of total trade.  \nFigure 6: Agricultural Coverage of Integrating Asia FTAs (%) \n 26%\nComprehensive\nExcluded or Limited\n50%\nSome Coverage\n24%\n \nFTA = free trade agreement, WTO = World Trade Organization. \nNotes:  \n(i) The data cover 50 Integrating Asia FTAs and do not include Taipei,China\u2013Nicaragua FTA; Taipei,China\u2013El \nSalvador\u2013Honduras FTA; Taipei,China\u2013Guatemala FTA; and Singapore\u2013Peru FTA due to difficulty in accessing \nofficial English translations of FTAs. Agricultural products and chapters are classified according to WTO guidelines.  \n(ii) \"Comprehensive\" means agriculture is substantially covered (at least 85% of agricultural product lines) or not more \nthan 150 product lines are excluded. \"Excluded or Limited\" means agriculture is completely excluded or less than 100 \nproduct lines are included. \"Some Coverage\" refers to those cases in between \u201cExcluded or Limited\u201d and \n\u201cComprehensive.\u201d  \nSource: Legal annexes of FTAs (www.aric.adb.org) and WTO reports; data as of June 2009. \nBetter coverage of agricultural trade in Asian FTAs is needed and a gradual approach to \nliberalization  seems  optimal  for  developing  economies.  This  is  a  key  element  of  the \ncontinuation of the liberalization agenda for trade in goods. An important future step would \nbe to include provisions on agricultural products in all prospective agreements. This would \nserve as a signal for producers to adjust to competition and improve productivity. A next step \nwould be meeting the benchmark for comprehensiveness by ensuring coverage of at least \n85% of all agricultural product lines in a given agreement and minimizing exclusions to not \nmore than 150 product lines. This can be done by adopting a negative list approach to \nagricultural products with a few sensitive items. Issues for the future would include a realistic \ntariff elimination schedule, a transparent sanitary and phytosanitary regime, and reform of \nsubsidies. \n3.4  Challenge 4: Increasing WTO-Plus Elements \nAsian FTAs are under increasing scrutiny for their scope, i.e., inclusion of new issues that go \nbeyond the WTO framework. The WTO system that emerged from the Uruguay Round in the \nmid-1990s consisted of substantive agreements on goods and services. The subsequent \nWTO Doha Development Round initiated in 2001 has focused on liberalization in agriculture \nand non-agricultural market access. The four Singapore issues were conditionally included \n  16", "ADBI Working Paper 144  Kawai and Wignaraja \n \nin  the  work  program  for  the  Doha  Round,  but  were  dropped  at  the  WTO  Ministerial \nConference  in  Cancun  in  2004.  WTO-plus  agreements  and  new  age  FTAs,  which  are \ncomprehensive  FTAs  that  address  the  Singapore  issues,  are  becoming  more  common \nglobally (Fiorentino Crawford, and Toqueboeuf 2009). An increase in WTO-plus elements in \nthe landscape of Asian FTAs has been identified as a pressing challenge for economies. \nStudies suggest that Asian FTAs vary considerably in their scope with some sophisticated \nagreements  alongside  limited  FTAs  (Banda  and  Whalley  2005;  Plummer  2007).11 Yet, \nsystematic cross-country evidence on the scope of Asian FTAs is lacking, particularly with \nregard to more recent agreements.  \nFigure 7 shows the scope of concluded Asian FTAs at the national level according to (i) \nnarrow agreements that primarily deal with good and/or services, and have few WTO-plus \nelements;  and  (ii)  broad  agreements  with  many  WTO-plus  elements.  The  scope  of \nconcluded agreements reflects a combination of economic interests, economic strength, and \nnegotiation capacity. See Appendix Table 5 for details.  \nFigure 7: Scope of Concluded FTAs in Integrating Asia \n(Number of FTAs) \n15 Goods and/or Services WTO-plus\n10\n5\n0\nei Darussalam Cambodia PRC g Kong, China India Indonesia Japan Korea, Rep. of Lao PDR Malaysia Myanmar Philippines Singapore Taipei,China Thailand Viet Nam\nn n\nu o\nr H\nB\n \nADB = Asian Development Bank; FTA = free trade agreement; Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; PRC = \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China; WTO = World Trade Organization. \nNote: Data do not include Taipei,China\u2013Nicaragua and Taipei,China\u2013El Salvador\u2013Honduras FTAs due to difficulty in \naccessing official English translation of the FTAs.  \nSource: ADB\u2019s Asia Regional Integration Center (ARIC) FTA Database (www.aric.adb.org); data as of June 2009. \n                                                 \n11 An early review of 11 Asian agreements concluded that \"modern FTAs in Asia, some of which are the most \nsophisticated in the world, have tended to be more comprehensive in terms of coverage and of the building \nbloc rather than the stumbling bloc type, though there are some (minor) exceptions in terms of certain \ncomponents\" (Plummer, 2007: 1795). The study suggested a set of best practices to guide future FTAs.  \n  17", "ADBI Working Paper 144  Kawai and Wignaraja \n \nThree leading participants in Asian FTAs\u2014Japan, Korea, and Singapore\u2014strongly favor a \nWTO-plus approach to FTAs. Appendix Table 6 summarizes coverage of selected FTAs by \nparticipant. All of Japan's agreements and most of Singapore's and Korea's are WTO-plus. \nLikewise, Thailand and Malaysia largely follow a WTO-plus format. Poorer economies, such \nas Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam, as well as the Philippines and Indonesia, \nwhich rely heavily on ASEAN for their respective FTA strategies, are party to a mix of WTO-\nplus and other agreements.  \nHistorically,  the  PRC  and  India  have  been  relatively  cautious  on  scope,  preferring \nagreements focusing on goods and services elements. More recently, however, both have \nbegun to experiment by incorporating some WTO-plus provisions such as in the India\u2013\nSingapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) and the PRC\u2013New \nZealand FTA. Thus, with a few exceptions, Asian economies are increasingly favoring WTO-\nplus agreements rather than narrowly limited agreements. \nSome additional points are noteworthy about WTO-plus provisions in Asian FTAs (Kawai \nand  Wignaraja  2009a).  First,  agreements  between  developed  countries  and  developing \ncountries generally take a WTO-plus format. Examples include the ASEAN\u2013Japan FTA, US\u2013\nSingapore  FTA,  US\u2013Korea  FTA,  and  PRC\u2013New  Zealand  FTA.  Second,  Korea  and \nSingapore  tend  to  behave  like  developed  countries  in  their  agreements  with  many \ndeveloping countries. This behavior is visible in the Transpacific Strategic EPA, Singapore\u2013\nPRC FTA, and Korea\u2013Chile FTA. Third, some existing FTAs are gradually being expanded \nto have WTO-plus coverage. Comprehensive agreements under negotiation include the \nASEAN\u2013Korea CEPA and the India\u2013Sri Lanka CEPA.  \nThe inclusion of WTO-plus provisions\u2014particularly the four Singapore issues\u2014would be \ndesirable  in  all  future  Asian  FTAs.  For  example,  competition  policy  and  investment \nprovisions  are  integral  ingredients  in  facilitating  FDI  inflows  and  the  development  of \nproduction networks. Inclusion of provisions on trade facilitation and logistics development \nwould help lower transactions costs in conducting trade. Cooperation provisions\u2014along the \nline  of  the  APEC  economic  and  technical  cooperation  (ECOTECH)  agenda12\u2014would \nstimulate technology transfer and industrial competitiveness. In their FTA negotiations, the \nUS and EU prefer a single undertaking and the inclusion of these WTO-plus provisions. The \nUS\u2013Singapore and US\u2013Korea agreements are cases in point. ASEAN is also considering an \nASEAN  Investment  Agreement  as  a  part  of  the  process  of  moving  toward  an  ASEAN \nEconomic Community by 2015. \n3.5  Challenge 5: Forming a Region-Wide FTA \nFinally, there is increasing recognition in Asia of the merits in forming a region-wide FTA as \na means to consolidate the plethora of bilateral and plurilateral agreements. Such an FTA \nwould confer various economic benefits: (i) increase market access to goods, services, \nskills, and technology (ii) increase market size to permit specialization and realization of \neconomies of scale; (iii) facilitie the FDI activities and technology transfer of MNCs; and (iv) \npermit simplification of tariff schedules, rules, and standards.  \nASEAN\u2014with the region's oldest FTA\u2014is emerging as an integration hub for FTAs in East \nAsia. PRC, Japan, and Korea have implemented their respective FTAs with ASEAN. India \nand Australia and New Zealand are also following suit and implementing FTAs with ASEAN. \nWith key ASEAN+1 agreements underway, the policy discussion in East Asia is focusing on \ncompeting region-wide FTA proposals\u2014an East Asia Free Trade Area (EAFTA) among \nASEAN+3 countries and a Comprehensive Economic Partnership for East Asia (CEPEA) \namong  ASEAN+6  countries\u2014that  will  guide  future  policy-led  integration  in  the  region. \n                                                 \n12 ECOTECH is the APEC schedule of programs designed to build capacity and skills in APEC member \neconomies to enable them to participate more fully in the regional economy and the liberalization process. See \nhttp://www.apec.org for more information. \n  18", "ADBI Working Paper 144  Kawai and Wignaraja \n \nSeeking to bridge ASEAN and its Northeast Asian neighbors, the EAFTA was an early vision \nof an East Asia-wide FTA. CEPEA has emerged through the realization that synergies could \nbe gained by linking ASEAN+3 countries with India and Australia and New Zealand. An \nimportant challenge is to identify which of the two is more beneficial, between an EAFTA and \nCEPEA, in terms of economic welfare for Asia.  \nSome studies using CGE models have been conducted on the impact of prospective FTAs \non East Asian economies (Gilbert, Scollay, and Bora 2004; Bchir and Fouquin 2006). CGE \nmodels have the advantage of being based on consistent structural equations that describe \neconomic activity in each economy. While there has been some CGE work on an EAFTA \nand other alternatives, only limited work is available on the effects of a CEPEA and on a \ncomparison between an EAFTA and CEPEA (a recent example is Lee, Owen, and van der \nMensbrugghe 2009). Furthermore, such work tends to narrowly focus on an FTA involving \ngoods only, while other aspects of East Asian FTA coverage\u2014such as services and trade \ncosts\u2014are excluded. A more comprehensive set of CGE estimates is required to inform the \npolicy debate. \nFigure 8 shows the results of a CGE exercise for economies in Integrating Asia. The EAFTA \nscenario provides for free trade among the 10 ASEAN members, PRC, Japan, and Korea. \nThe CEPEA scenario broadens the EAFTA scenario to include India, Australia, and New \nZealand. Four model features are noteworthy: (i) strong microeconomic foundations and \ndetailed  interactions  among  industries,  consumers,  and  governments  across  the  global \neconomy; (ii) medium- to long-run investment effects by allowing for trade to affect capital \nstocks through investment activities; (iii) use of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) \ndatabase (version 6.3) through to 2017,13 which projects trade and production patterns to \nrepresent a post-Uruguay Round world using the phaseout of the Agreement on Textiles and \nClothing, the implementation of the remaining WTO commitments under the Doha Round, \nand enlargement of the EU to 27 members; and (iv) a stylized FTA that includes goods, \nservices, and some aspects of trade cost reduction. The model's baseline is 2017 and the \nsimulations show changes from this baseline. As the formation of a region-wide FTA may \ntake time, setting up the model and dataset in this way provides for more realistic scenarios.  \n                                                 \n13 From Kawai and Wignaraja (2009a).

Our overall findings broadly echo those \nof  Lee,  Owen,  and  van  der  Mensbrugghe  (2009),  whose  sophisticated  CGE  exercise \nincorporates tariff reduction, trade cost reduction, and endogenously determined productivity \nlevels. These authors also suggest that the CEPEA scenario (US$201 billion) yields larger \ngains than the EAFTA scenario (US$177 billion), and that insiders gain while losses to \noutsiders are negligible. \n\u2022  Some interesting national level results in terms of percentage change from 2017 \nbaseline income emerge from this exercise (see Figure 8):  \n\u2022  For ASEAN\u2019s more dynamic members, projected gains are significant under the \nCEPEA  scenario:  Thailand  (12.8%),  Viet  Nam  (7.6%),  Malaysia  (6.3%),  and \nSingapore (5.4%). For the rest of ASEAN\u2014Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines, and \nremaining ASEAN economies\u2014the gains are less than 3.0%. \n\u2022  Among Northeast Asian countries, Korea experiences the largest gains under the \nEAFTA (6.2%) and CEPEA (6.4%) scenarios. \n  20", "ADBI Working Paper 144  Kawai and Wignaraja \n \n\u2022  India, Australia, and New Zealand experience losses under the EAFTA scenario \nand gains under the CEPEA scenario. The losses under an EAFTA are less than \n0.5% for each, while under a CEPEA, gains are 2.4% for India, 3.9% for Australia, \nand 5.2% for New Zealand.  \n\u2022  Third parties like Hong Kong, China and Taipei,China experience small losses \nfrom being excluded from both EAFTA and CEPEA.  \nThe  CGE  analysis  indicates  that  a  region-wide  agreement  in  East  Asia,  particularly  a \nCEPEA,  provides  welfare  gains  over  the  present  wave  of  bilateralism.14  The  gains  to \nmembers of such an agreement are notable, while losses to non-members are relatively \nsmall. Accordingly, arguments for and moves toward CEPEA are supported by economic \nmodeling. The CGE analysis also reveals that some members gain more than others and \nthis issue may need to be addressed in policy discussions. There is a case for further \nnarrowing development gaps by providing financial and technical support for low-income \ncountries, particularly with respect to trade-related infrastructure, customs modernization, \nenhancing SME development, and capacity building.  \n4.  POLITICAL ECONOMY CONSIDERATIONS OF FTA \nCONSOLIDATION IN ASIA \nEven if the consolidation of FTAs into a region-wide agreement\u2014whether in the form of an \nEAFTA among the ASEAN+3 countries or a CEPEA among the ASEAN+6 countries\u2014yields \nlarge economic gains to East Asia, it is not obvious that such a region-wide FTA can be \ncreated given political economy considerations. The PRC has been a strong supporter of an \nEAFTA, while Japan has put more emphasis on a CEPEA. In addition, political rivalry over \nFTA leadership in East Asia may hinder any such joint venture. Also, given the role of the \nUS in Asia as a security anchor for many countries, one may argue that excluding the US \nfrom  the  Asian  integration  process  may  not  be  viable  from  a  political  perspective. \nFurthermore,  the  rising  importance  of  European  markets  for  many  Asian  economies \nsuggests that involving Europe may also make sense. \nWe consider three competing scenarios for consolidation of various East Asian FTAs into a \nlarger FTA: (i) an East Asia-wide FTA, either in the form of an EAFTA or CEPEA; (ii) a Free \nTrade Area of the Asia\u2013Pacific (FTAAP) among APEC countries; and (iii) a Free Trade Area \nof Asia and Europe (FTAAE) among Asia\u2013Europe Meeting (ASEM) countries. An East Asia-\nwide FTA, whether an EAFTA or CEPEA, addresses the noodle bowl problem among the \nproduction network countries, while an FTAAP or an FTAAE takes into account external \nmarkets as well. The idea of forming an EAFTA or CEPEA has been on the official agenda \nof the ASEAN+3 Leaders\u2019 process and East Asia Summit meetings. In the same vein, an \nFTAAP has been officially considered in the APEC Leaders\u2019 process. However, the idea of \nestablishing an FTAAE has not attracted much attention so far.  \nTo discuss these scenarios and their feasibility, some political economy considerations have \nto be made with regard to an East Asia-wide FTA (EAFTA or CEPEA) and an FTAAP. \n4.1  Building Blocks for Wider Agreements  \nDue to a rise in the number of key players in official negotiations for FTAs, creating a large \nFTA can become more complicated. This suggests that forming an FTAAP would be more \ncomplex than forming a CEPEA, and that forming a CEPEA would be more complex than \nforming an EAFTA. Therefore, the first step toward consolidation of various FTAs might be to \n                                                 \n14 As Lee, Owen, and van der Mensbrugghe (2009) observed, a worthwhile but difficult extension of CGE models \non region-wide Asian FTAs would be to endogenize FDI flows involving Asian countries. Consistent data on \nbilateral FDI flows in Asia, however, are lacking.  \n  21", "ADBI Working Paper 144  Kawai and Wignaraja \n \ncreate preconditions\u2014or building blocks\u2014for a smaller region-wide FTA, like an EAFTA, and \nthen to develop further conditions toward a wider FTA, such as a CEPEA or FTAAP. In this \nprocess, ASEAN will likely act as the integration hub or convener. The \u201c+3 countries\u201d\u2014PRC, \nJapan, and Korea\u2014would then need to coordinate their trade and FDI regimes. India, which \nhas only recently moved away from its former protectionist enclosure, needs to pursue \ndeeper  structural  and  regulatory  reforms  addressing  both  tariff  issues  and  \u201cbehind-the-\nborder\u201d red tape.  \nAn  EAFTA  or  CEPEA. An EAFTA or a CEPEA would likely be based on the existing \nASEAN+1 FTAs with the \u201cplus countries\u201d\u2014such as PRC, Japan, Korea, India, Australia, and \nNew Zealand\u2014as well as future networks of plurilateral and/or bilateral FTAs among these \nplus  countries.  Almost  all  of  the  five  ASEAN+1  FTAs  have  been  completed,  with  the \nASEAN+India FTA expected to be signed soon. In contrast, other multilateral and/or bilateral \nFTAs are patchy and some important components\u2014such as a trilateral FTA among PRC, \nJapan, and Korea or three bilateral FTAs among these three countries\u2014are still missing \n(Table 1). All these FTAs can facilitate the formation of an EAFTA or CEPEA as important \nbuilding blocks. From this perspective, the successful formation of an EAFTA or CEPEA \nrequires not only a set of ASEAN+1 FTAs, but also a series of agreements among the plus \ncountries, particularly among PRC, Japan, and Korea.  \nTable 1: Bilateral and Plurilateral FTAs \n(by status) \n  ASEAN  Japan  PRC  Korea,  India  Australia  New \nRep. of  Zealand \nASEAN  \u2297  \u2297  \u2297  \u2297  \u03bf  \u2297 \nJapan  \u2297  \u2014  \u2666  \u03bf  \u03bf  \u03bf  \u2666 \nPRC  \u2297  \u2666  \u2014  \u2666  \u2666  \u03bf  \u2297 \nKorea, Rep.  \u2297  \u03bf  \u2666  \u2014  \u03bf  \u2666  \u03bf \nof \nIndia  \u03bf  \u03bf  \u2666  \u03bf  \u2014  \u2666  \u2666 \nAustralia  \u2297  \u03bf  \u03bf  \u2666  \u2666  \u2014  \u2297 \nNew Zealand  \u2666  \u2297  \u03bf  \u2666  \u2297  \u2014 \n\u2297\n = FTAs negotiations signed or FTAs in place; \u03bf = official negotiation under way; \u2666 = official negotiation has not \nstarted.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank; ASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations; FTA = free trade agreement; \nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSource: ADB\u2019s Asia Regional Integration Center (ARIC) FTA database (www.aric.adb.org); data as of June 2009. \nIn principle, ASEAN+3 or ASEAN+6 countries can begin EAFTA or CEPEA negotiations \nwithout some of these important building blocks among the plus-three countries in place, as \nthese blocks can be created as a part of the EAFTA or CEPEA negotiations. Nonetheless, \ngiven that bilateral negotiations between the PRC and Japan will likely take time, it would be \npreferable to conclude such a contentious agreement before starting the official negotiation \nprocess for an EAFTA or CEPEA. With all the building blocks in place, EAFTA or CEPEA \nnegotiations can lead to the early formation of a single, larger FTA through consolidation and \nharmonization of existing FTAs. \nThe respective cases vary for supporting an EAFTA and a CEPEA, yet they are linked. An \nimportant reason for an EAFTA is that the production network has been developed most \nsignificantly among the ASEAN+3 countries, and harmonizing rules of origin among these \ncountries can produce a tangible benefit. In addition, India is perceived as a slow liberalizer \nand it would take more time to produce a region-wide FTA if India were included from the \nbeginning. Once a process begins for EAFTA negotiations, pressure could then be applied \nto India to further open up its economy. On the other hand, a reason for advocating a \nCEPEA is that the production network is already developing beyond ASEAN+3 countries, \n  22", "ADBI Working Paper 144  Kawai and Wignaraja \n \nencompassing India and Australia. In addition, the economic benefit from FTA consolidation \nis larger with a CEPEA than with an EAFTA. \nThe officially appointed study group for a CEPEA has agreed that ASEAN+3 countries \nshould focus on trade and investment liberalization as the first priority, facilitation as the \nsecond, and technical cooperation as the last, and that ASEAN+6 countries may focus on \ntechnical cooperation as the top priority, trade and investment facilitation as the next, and \nliberalization as the least. The study group\u2019s description of the difference in terms of priorities \nbetween an EAFTA and a CEPEA implies that an EAFTA should proceed first, followed by a \nCEPEA. This sequenced approach would be realistic. \nA PRC\u2013Japan\u2013Korea FTA. One of the most important preconditions for an EAFTA is the \ncreation of either a trilateral FTA among PRC, Japan, and Korea (CJK FTA) or three bilateral \nFTAs between pairs of these countries. However, differences in the eagerness of forming \nFTAs exist among these three countries. The PRC is keen on establishing FTAs with Japan \nand Korea, but both Japan and Korea have some reservations over entering into FTAs with \nthe PRC.  \nThe Japanese government is concerned about the rising competitiveness of the PRC\u2019s \nmanufacturing sector and the competitiveness of the PRC\u2019s agricultural products. Japan \nwishes to treat the PRC as a non-market economy so that it can use safeguard measures \nagainst  a  rapid  increase  of  PRC  imports  into  the  Japanese  markets,  but  the  PRC\u2019s \ngovernment insists upon market economy status for itself. Japan also argues that the PRC \nhas yet to clearly demonstrate progress toward implementation of WTO entry commitments, \nincluding the treatment of Japanese firms in the PRC, clarity of regulations and rules over \nfirms, and protection of intellectual property rights. Food safety issues are also a concern for \nJapan. The Japanese government has taken the position that an investment treaty should be \na first condition before starting an EPA negotiation. \nKorea is concerned about excessive dependence on the PRC market and the lack of an \noverall policy on how to position itself in terms of trade and investment vis-\u00e0-vis the PRC. \nKorea is also concerned about the PRC\u2019s agricultural competitiveness.15  \nJapan and Korea are interested in concluding an FTA with each other, but each country has \nconcerns. Japan\u2019s primary concern over a Japan\u2013Korea EPA is the competitiveness of \nKorea\u2019s  agriculture  and  fishery  sectors.  In  contrast,  Korea  is  concerned  about  Japan\u2019s \ncompetitiveness  in  manufactured  products  (intermediate  inputs),  Korea\u2019s  large  tariff \nconcessions required due to high most favored nation tariffs, and the risk of greater bilateral \ntrade deficits with Japan. \nDespite these problems, if the three countries can negotiate mutually agreeable FTAs, they \ncan provide a strong foundation for a possible EAFTA, and eventually a CEPEA and FTAAP. \nThis will require joint political commitment from the governments of all three countries. \nAn FTAAP. As with an EAFTA or CEPEA, an Asia and Pacific-wide FTA requires a series of \nplurilateral and/or bilateral agreements among key players, particularly those for the US with \nASEAN, PRC, and Japan (the US\u2013Korea FTA has been concluded). Given that the US \nprovides the most open market for Asian products and a security umbrella for key East Asian \neconomies, the region\u2019s relationship with the US is critical, both economically and politically.  \nAPEC remains important for both East Asia and the US because it is the only multilateral \neconomic forum that bridges the two. The US has advocated strengthening economic ties \namong APEC members through the formation of an APEC-wide free trade area (e.g., an \nFTAAP). While several East Asian countries have concluded bilateral FTAs with the US, \nothers have reservations about a comprehensive agreement with the US. Deeper questions \n                                                 \n15 Interestingly, Korean farmers do not seem threatened by the Korea\u2013US FTA, but express concerns on \nagriculture with regard to a Korea\u2013PRC FTA. \n  23", "ADBI Working Paper 144  Kawai and Wignaraja \n \nremain as to whether the US is ready to agree to an FTA with the whole of East Asia\u2014one \nthat includes the PRC\u2014under the current political environment. \nAn FTAAP could increase two-way trade of partner countries in a significant way, and could \nbe a useful way of reviving the stalled Doha Round or offer a \u201cPlan B\u201d hedge should the \nDoha Round permanently fail (Bergsten 2007; Hufbauer and Schott 2009). An FTAAP was \nproposed for consideration at the APEC Summits in 2007 and 2008. The formation of an \nFTAAP is expected to take many years and involve studies, evaluations, and negotiations \namong all 21 member economies. Given that the number of APEC member economies is so \nlarge, a smaller group may be more appropriate to initiate the process (e.g., an EAFTA).  \nA recently emerging FTA, called the Transpacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement \n(Transpacific SEPA), is attracting a growing number of countries sympathetic to its goal of \nhigh-standard liberalization (Markheim 2008). The Transpacific SEPA, also known as the \nPacific Four (P4) agreement, is a plurilateral FTA among Brunei Darussalam, Chile, New \nZealand, and Singapore that came into force in May 2006.16 The aim of the agreement is to \neliminate 90% of all tariffs among member countries upon entry into force and reduce all \ntrade  tariffs  to  zero  by  2015.  The  Transpacific  SEPA  is  a  comprehensive  agreement \ncovering  many  WTO-plus  elements,  including  ROOs,  trade  remedies,  sanitary  and \nphytosanitary  measures,  technical  barriers  to  trade,  intellectual  property,  government \nprocurement,  and competition  policy.  As  part  of  the  conclusion  of negotiations,  the  P4 \ncountries  agreed  to  negotiate  on  financial  services  and  investment  within  2  years  of \nTranspacific SEPA\u2019s entry into force.  \nThe Transpacific SEPA has the potential to grow to include many other nations under the \nagreement\u2019s accession clause. In September 2008, the US announced it had decided to \nenter into negotiations to join the group. Australia and Peru also expressed interest in similar \nnegotiations. Thus, the Transpacific SEPA could expand and strengthen US economic and \nstrategic ties to the APEC region and could lay the foundation for a wider FTAAP.  \nThere are two possible avenues to creating an FTAAP: one through an EAFTA or CEPEA, \nand  the  other  through  an  expanded  Transpacific  SEPA.  However,  there  are  several \nnoteworthy stumbling blocks in pursuing the Transpacific SEPA route. First, APEC is a \nvoluntary,  non-binding  organization;  however,  forming  an  FTA  requires  the  concerned \ngovernments\u2019  binding  commitments  to  trade  liberalization,  which  means  that  this  route \nshould  be  pursued  outside  of  the  formal  APEC  process  unless  the  mandate  of  APEC \nchanges.17 Second, the Transpacific SEPA route neglects the importance of ASEAN as the \nhub for East Asian integration, especially given that not all ASEAN countries are APEC \nmembers.  Currently,  only  Brunei  Darussalam  and  Singapore  are  Transpacific  SEPA \nmembers from ASEAN and it is highly unlikely that the other ASEAN countries that are also \nAPEC members could join the Transpacific SEPA within a reasonable time frame because \nthe agreement is a high-standard and comprehensive liberalization agreement. Third, India \nis not an APEC  member and, therefore, it would take some time for India to join the \nTranspacific SEPA.  \nLinks with Europe. Though connecting East Asia with Europe is a relatively new idea, the \nEuropean Commission has already begun negotiating FTAs with ASEAN, India, and Korea. \nOnce the PRC and Japan come into this discussion, a solid foundation for an East Asia\u2013EU \nFTA (an FTAEE, or even a wider FTA among the ASEM countries) will be in place. \n                                                 \n16 The Transpacific SEPA was previously known as the Pacific Three Closer Economic Partnership (P3-CEP), \nwith its negotiations first launched at the 2002 APEC Leaders\u2019 Summit. \n17 Changing APEC\u2019s mandate into a prospective FTA organization, however, would likely encounter strong \noppositions from many middle-income ASEAN countries. \n  24", "ADBI Working Paper 144  Kawai and Wignaraja \n \n4.2  Likely Scenario: Sequencing of FTA Consolidation \nGiven the prominence of political economy considerations as they relate to ASEAN regional \neconomic integration, it would likely be difficult to expand the Transpacific SEPA to all of \nEast Asia within a short period of time. FTA consolidation in East Asia is likely to proceed \nalong the line of an ASEAN-centric EAFTA or CEPEA. The most likely scenario would be the \nfollowing consolidation sequence: \n\u2022  acceleration of an ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) to be created by 2015; \n\u2022  completion of ASEAN+1 FTAs with each of the \u201cplus\u201d countries; \n\u2022  creation of a CJK FTA either through a PRC\u2013Japan\u2013Korea trilateral FTA or three \nbilateral FTAs among the three countries; \n\u2022  formation of an EAFTA among the ASEAN+3 countries through mechanisms to \nconnect the ASEAN+1 FTAs and a CJK FTA by allowing simplification, cumulation, \nand harmonization of ROOs; \n\u2022  formation of a CEPEA by including India and Australia and New Zealand; and \n\u2022  connection between East Asia and the US through an FTAAP, and with Europe \nthrough an FTAAE. \nThe  dynamics  of  this  \u201clikely  scenario\u201d  can  evolve  over  time,  with  each  step  creating \nincentives  for  the  next  step  to  be  taken.  First,  completion  of  an  ASEAN  Economic \nCommunity (AEC) is vital to FTA consolidation in East Asia as this will strengthen ASEAN\u2019s \nability to play the region\u2019s integration hub role. Once an AEC is in place, ASEAN will be \ntransformed  into  a  much  more  coherent  entity  and,  building  on  this  strength,  can \nsubstantially improve the quality of ASEAN+1 FTAs\u2014to be formed with the \u201cplus\u201d countries \nof PRC, Japan, Korea, India, and Australia and New Zealand.  \nNext, creation of a CJK FTA (or three bilateral FTAs among PRC, Japan, and Korea) is a \nnecessary building block for the formation of an EAFTA because without it, integration of the \nASEAN+3 countries through a formal institutional arrangement is impossible. The political \ndecision by Japan and the PRC to form an FTA (or EPA) is the cornerstone. ASEAN may \nplay a key role in encouraging Japan and PRC (and Korea) to agree on a Northeast Asian \nFTA. Once a CJK FTA (or at least a bilateral FTA between the PRC and Japan) is formed, it \ncan  be  connected  with  the  ASEAN+1  FTAs  through  various  mechanisms  that  allow \nsimplification,  cumulation,  and  harmonization  of  ROOs.  This  development  will  put \ncompetitive pressures on India, an excluded party, to further liberalize so that India will be \neventually included in a larger FTA, thus forming a CEPEA.  \nAlong this line of sequencing, several East Asian APEC economies (e.g., Japan and Korea) \nmay join the Transpacific SEPA, and the US may conclude an FTA with ASEAN as an \nASEAN+1 partner.18 Indeed, by that time the US and Europe will likely have concluded a \nseries of FTAs with several key East Asian economies so that it will be possible to eventually \nconnect the whole of East Asia with the US (possibly through an FTAAP), and with Europe \n(possibly  through  an  FTAAE).  All  of  these  nested  approaches  are  important  and  can \npotentially accelerate the process of East Asian integration and, more broadly, transpacific \neconomic integration.  \n                                                 \n18 The US has joined ASEAN\u2019s Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, which is a significant political step for the \nrelationship between the two. This can lay a strong foundation for the US to become a legitimate ASEAN+1 \npartner. \n  25", "ADBI Working Paper 144  Kawai and Wignaraja \n \n5.  CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, we have outlined the main trends and challenges associated with the rapid \nspread  of  Asian  FTAs,  and  provided  new  evidence  from  firm  surveys,  analysis  of \nagreements,  and  CGE  results.  The  paper  also  considered  political  economy  issues \nassociated with FTA consolidation in Asia, and various competing proposals. The evidence \nhighlights  the  shift  in  East  Asia's  trade  policy  that  has  occurred  since  2000.  With  54 \nconcluded agreements, FTAs are assuming more importance as a tool of commercial policy \nin East Asia than ever before. A classic hub and spoke arrangement has developed whereby \nfive  large  economies  have  emerged  as  hubs  with  their  smaller  neighbors  as  spokes. \nFurthermore, the Asian FTAs have maintained a strong cross-regional orientation, the trade \ncoverage  of  FTAs  has  increased,  and  issues  other  than  trade  liberalization\u2014such  as \ninvestment, intellectual property rights, and labor issues\u2014have been included.   \nThe  conclusion  of  a  comprehensive  Doha  Round  Agreement  would  be  an  invaluable \ncontribution to Asian prosperity. But the outcome of the stalled global trade talks remains \nuncertain. With a large number of FTAs either under negotiation or proposed, Asian FTAs \nare here to stay. A pragmatic approach would be to maximize the benefits of FTAs while \nminimizing  their  costs. Based  on  the  new  evidence  presented  in  the  paper,  some  key \nelements of a pragmatic approach towards Asia\u2019s FTAs might include: \n\u2022  improving  use  of  FTAs  at  the  firm  level  through  increased  awareness  and \nstrengthened institutional support systems, particularly for SMEs; \n\u2022  tackling the Asian \u201cnoodle bowl\u201d problem by encouraging rationalization of ROOs \nand upgrading ROO administration to best practice levels; \n\u2022  encouraging better coverage of agricultural products in Asian FTAs and a gradual \napproach to agricultural trade liberalization; \n\u2022  including  WTO-plus  provisions\u2014particularly  the  four  Singapore  issues\u2014in  all \nfuture Asian agreements; and  \n\u2022  facilitating the creation of a region-wide agreement in East Asia\u2014particularly a \nCEPEA\u2014with  appropriate  sub-sequencing  and  support  for  dealing  with \ndevelopment gaps among members.  \nWhile the economic case for a region-wide agreement such as a CEPEA is borne out by \nCGE analysis, political economy considerations remain likely to weigh heavily on the final \noutcome. A sequential approach of first creating a series of building blocks within Asia\u2014\ndeepening ASEAN economic integration, creating a CJK FTA, and developing an EAFTA \nbefore moving to a CEPEA\u2014followed by connecting Asia with the US and Europe seems the \nmost likely scenario. In conclusion, a bottom-up approach to a Doha Round Agreement \nemerges from the analysis.  \n  26", "ADBI Working Paper 144  Kawai and Wignaraja \n \nAPPENDIX: TABLES \nAppendix Table 1: Profile of Integrating Asia Economies \nCountry  GNI per Capita  Applied MFN  Exports \n% of \n2007 current US$  2008 US$  world \n  (billion)  2007 average  (billion)  exports \n        \nBrunei Darussalama   \u2014  3.6  9.4  0.06 \nCambodia                          550  14.2  4.3  0.03 \nChina, People's Republic of         2,370  9.9  1484.1  9.27 \nHong Kong, China                      31,560  0  354.4  2.21 \nIndia                            950  14.5  187.4  1.17 \nIndonesia                        1,650  6.9  155.1  0.97 \nJapan                      37,790  5.1  783.1  4.89 \nKorea, Republic of                      19,7300  12.2  417.5  2.61 \nLao People\u2019s Dem.
