INTRODUCTION \n\nLam and Cuong \n\nThere  are  different  definitions  of  social  mobility  (e.g.,  Behrman  2000;  Torche  \n2015).  Social  mobility  can  refer  to  movement  of  individuals  and  households  across \ndifferent  social  positions.  Social  mobility  includes  intergenerational  mobility  and \nintragenerational  mobility.  Intergenerational  mobility  is  the  change  in  position  of  a \nperson or a household as compared with previous generations, while intragenerational \nmobility is the change in position of a person or a household over time. Social mobility \ncan be measured in terms of education, employment, and income. The movement can \nbe downward or upward. \n\nThere is an association between social mobility  and inequality. In a society with high-\nincome  inequality,  there  are  very  rich  as  well  as  very  poor  households,  and  family \nbackground  can  be  an  important  factor  in  determining  income  of  children  (Corak \n2013a).  For  example,  being  born  in  a  rich  family  can  result  in  better  health  and \neducation  for  children.  Family  resources  and  networks  also  affect  children\u2019s  networks \nand employment (Corak 2013a). Children born in rich families are more likely to have \ngood  jobs  and  high  earnings.  As  a  result,  high  inequality  can  result  in  low  social \nmobility  including  both  intragenerational  and  intergenerational  mobility.  The  invert \nassociation between intergenerational mobility and inequality is described by the Great \nGatsby curve (Corak 2013b). Countries with high-income inequality tend to have higher \nintergenerational elasticity or low-income mobility across the generations.  \n\nViet Nam has achieved high economic growth during the recent decades. Poverty has \nsignificantly  decreased  over  time.  The  proportion  of  people  below  the  expenditure \npoverty line decreased from 58.1% in 1993 to 14.5% in 2008 and 10% in 2012. Poverty \nrate  has  declined  in  all  population  groups  and  in  all  geographic  regions  (World  Bank \n2013). 1 However,  poverty  rate  remains  very  high  in  remote  and  mountainous  areas \nwhere there is a high proportion of ethnic minorities. In some remote areas, more than \n80%  of  people  still  live  below  the  poverty  line  (Nguyen  2011;  Lanjouw  et  al.  2013). \nThere  is  a  large  gap  in  the  living  standards  of  ethnic  minorities  and  the  Kinh  people. \nThe  absolute  income  gap  between  the  top  income  quintile  and  the  bottom  income \nquintile also tends to increase over time.  \n\nThere  is  an  influential  view  that  equality  in  opportunity  can  improve  income  equality. \nPoor  as  well  as  rich  children  should  have  the  same  opportunities  for  education  and \nbetter  employment  (Black  and  Devereux  2010).  Understanding  social  mobility  is  very \nimportant to improve equality in opportunities and welfare in Viet Nam. Thus, this study \nprovides a descriptive analysis of the situation and trend of social mobility in Viet Nam, \nand  subsequently  examines  factors  associated  with  social  mobility.  More  specifically, \nthis  study  has  three  objectives.  The  first  is  to  present  the  descriptive  analysis  of \nintragenerational mobility of income and employment mobility in Viet Nam. The second \nis  to  analyze  the  intergenerational  mobility  of  employment  and  earnings.  The  third  \nis  to  analyze  the  association  of  different  factors,  especially  education,  with  the \nintragenerational  and  intergenerational  mobility.  Data  used  for  this  analysis  are  \nfrom the Viet Nam Household Living Standard Surveys (VHLSS) in 2004, 2008, 2010, \nand 2014.  \n\nThere  is  a  large  number  of  studies  on  intergenerational  mobility  (for  review  e.g.,  see \nBlack  and  Devereux  2010;  Solon  2013;  and Torche  2015).  Most  studies focus  on  the \nanalysis  in  the  United  States  (US)  and  other  developed  countries.  There  are  fewer \nempirical  evidences  on  intergenerational  mobility  in  developing  countries,  possibly \n                                                \n1  For poverty measurement in Viet Nam, see for example Nguyen (2011) and Nguyen and Tran (2014).  \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 722 \n \n\nLam and Cuong \n\nbecause  of  less  available  data  sets  in  these  countries.  In  Viet  Nam,  two  studies \nestimate  the  intergenerational  elasticity.  Using  the  VHLSS  1998,  Hertz  et  al.  (2008) \nestimate  the  elasticity  of  education  between  parents  and  children  at  0.58.  Emran  \nand  Shilpi  (2011)  find  a  high  correlation  of  intergenerational  occupation  in  Viet  Nam \nusing  the  VHLSS  1993.  Most  recently,  Brand-Weiner  et  al.  (2015)  examine  the \nintragenerational  mobility  of  income  and  occupation  using  VHLSS  in  2004  and  2008, \nshowing rather high-income mobility in Viet Nam. However, the mobility of employment \nacross  sectors  (agriculture,  service,  and  industry)  is  small.  Several  studies  look  at \npoverty  transition  of  households  over  time  (e.g.,  Nguyen  2012;  Baulch  and  Vu  2010; \nNguyen et al. 2015). Overall, these studies find that ethnic minority and low education \nhouseholds tend to be more chronically poor than the Kinh majority and high education \nhouseholds.  \n\nCompared with previous studies on social mobility in Viet Nam, this study has several \ndifferences.  First,  this  study  examines  not  only  intragenerational  mobility  but  also \nintergenerational mobility in both occupational and earning outcomes. Previous studies \nlook  at  either  intragenerational  mobility  or  intergenerational  mobility.  Second,  we  use \nmost of the recent VHLSS (from 2004 to 2014) to examine the change in social mobility \nover  time.  Finally,  using  regressions,  we  are  able  to  investigate  the  association \nbetween several socioeconomic factors and social mobility.  \n\nintragenerational \n\nThis  paper  is  structured  into  five  sections.  After  the  Introduction,  the  second  \nsection  introduces  the  VHLSS  data  set.  The  third  section  presents  income  inequality \nand \nthird  \nsection  analyzes  the  intragenerational  occupational  mobility  of  individuals  over  time. \nThe  fourth  section  presents  the  analysis  of  intergenerational  mobility.  Finally,  the  fifth \nsection concludes. \n\nincome  mobility  of  households \n\nin  Viet  Nam.  The \n\n2.  DATA SETS \n\nThis  study  uses  sets  of  VHLSS  in  2004,  2008,  2010,  and  2014.  These  surveys  were \nconducted by the General Statistics Office (GSO) of Viet Nam with technical assistance \nfrom  the  World  Bank.  VHLSSs  are  conducted  every  2  years.  The  latest  survey  was \nreleased in 2014. In this study, we use the four VHLSSs mainly to analyze the changes \nin 2004\u20132008 and in 2010\u20132014. The surveys contain household-level and individual-\nlevel data. Data include basic demography, employment and labor force participation, \neducation, health, income, expenditure, housing, fixed assets and durable goods, and \nparticipation of households in poverty alleviation programs.  \n\nThe  number  of  households  sampled  in  VHLSS  2004,  2008,  2010,  and  2014  is  \n9,188,  9,189,  9,399,  and  9,398,  respectively.  There  were  40,437  individuals  from  the \nsampled  households  for  VHLSS  2004,  38,253  for  VHLSS  2008,  36,999  for  VHLSS \n2010,  and  35,520  for  2014.  The  VHLSSs  are  representative  at  the  urban/rural  and \nregional  levels.  There  were  1,817  panel  households  during  the  VHLSS  2004  and  the \nVHLSS  2008,  1,817  households  for  VHLSS  2010,  and  1,813  households  for  VHLSS \n2014.  However,  there  are  no  panel  data  between  the  VHLSS  2008  and  the  VHLSS \n2010.  The  VHLSSs  for  2010  and  2012  used  the  new  sample  frame  (from  the  2009 \nPopulation  and  Housing  Census).  As  a  result,  there  is  no  link  between  the  VHLSS \n2010 and the earlier VHLSSs. \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 722 \n \n\nLam and Cuong \n\n3.  HOUSEHOLD INCOME MOBILITY  \n\n3.1  Income Inequality \n\nInequality in Viet Nam, which is measured by the Gini index, has been quite stable over \ntime.  Inequality  increased  lightly  in  2008  and  2010  and  decreased  in  2012  and  2014. \nFigure 1 presents the income and expenditure Gini indexes during 2004\u20132014. Income \ninequality is higher than expenditure inequality, but the difference is small. In 2014, the \nincome  and  expenditure  Gini  indexes  were  0.39  and  0.35,  respectively.  It  should  be \nnoted  that  household  surveys  can  underestimate  income  inequality  since  they  do  not \ncapture the richest people of the country. \n\nFigure 1: Income and Expenditure Inequality over Time \n\nSource: Estimates from the Viet Nam Household Living Standard Surveys. \n\n \n\nAlthough  the  Gini  coefficient  did  not  increase  over  time,  the  gap  in  income  between \ngroups  increased  over  time.  The  absolute  per  capita  income  gap  between  urban  and \nrural  households  increased  from  D4,754  ($213)  in  2004  to  D6,344  ($288)  in  2014 \n(Figure 2). The gap between the Kinh/Hoa and ethnic minorities is larger. Not only the \nabsolute income gap but also the relative income gap increased over time. The ratio of \nper  capita  income  of  the  Kinh/Hoa  to  that  of  ethnic  minorities  increased  from  2.1  in \n2004 to 2.3 in 2014.2  \n\nThe  left  panel  of  Figure  3  presents  the  per  capita  income  of  all  households  and  the \n40% lowest income households. The Sustainable Development Goals on inequality is \nto  \u201cby  2030,  progressively  achieve  and  sustain  income  growth  of  the  bottom  40  per \ncent  of the  population  at  a rate  higher than the national  average.\u201d  During  the  past  10 \nyears from 2004 to 2014, the average annual growth rate of real per capita income of \nthe bottom 40% of the population is 5.4% per year, while the corresponding rate of the \nnational average is 5.5% per year. To achieve this target, households in lower income \nquintiles should have a higher growth rate of income. \n\n                                                \n2  There are 54 ethnic groups in Viet Nam, in which the Kinh majority accounts for 85% of the population. \nThe Kinh tends to live in delta areas and has higher living standards than other ethnic minorities. The \nHoa (Chinese) is a rich group and also lives in delta areas. Thus, the Hoa is often grouped with the Kinh \nin studies on household welfare in Viet Nam. \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 722 \n \n\nLam and Cuong \n\nFigure 2: Per Capita Income by Urban/Rural and Ethnicity \n\nNote: Per capita income is measured in January 2004 prices. \n\nSource: Estimates from the Viet Nam Household Living Standard Surveys. \n\nFigure 3: Per Capita Income by Income Quintiles \n\n \n\n \n\nNote: Per capita income is measured in January 2004 prices. \n\nSource: Estimates from the Viet Nam Household Living Standard Surveys. \n\nThe right panel of Figure 3 shows an important point of income inequality in Viet Nam. \nThere are no large gaps in per capita income among those in the bottom quintile to the \nnearest  richest quintile. However,  there  is  a  large  jump  in  per  capita  income from the \nnear  richest  to  the  richest  quintile.  It  implies  that  there  are  very  rich  households  in  \nthe richest quintile, and it would be very difficult to move to the richest quintile from a \nlower quintile. \n\n3.2  Income Mobility \n\nTo  examine  income  mobility,  we  use  panel  household  data  from  VHLSS  2004  and \nVHLSS 2008, and from VHLSS 2010 and VHLSS 2014. Households are grouped into \nincome quintiles. Figure 4 presents the percentage of households who improved their \nincome  level  from  the  bottom  income  quintile  (the  20%  lowest  income)  to  a  higher \nincome quintile over time by characteristics of household heads. It shows that 45% of \nhouseholds  in  the  bottom quintile  in  2004  moved  to  a  higher  income quintile  in  2008. \nThis figure is 37% during 2010\u20132014. It implies that the mobility of the lowest quintile \nhouseholds tended to decrease over time.  \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 722 \n \n\nLam and Cuong \n\nUrban  households  are  more  likely  to  move  up  than  rural  households.  The  gap  \nin  income  mobility  is  large  between  the  Kinh/Hoa  and  ethnic  minorities.  During  \n2010\u20132014,  around  19%  of  ethnic  minorities  in  the  bottom quintile  moved  to  a  higher \nincome quintile, while this figure for the Kinh and Hoa was 49%.  \n\nIncome  mobility  of  households  is  also  correlated  with  characteristics  of  household \nheads.  In  the  VHLSSs,  household  heads  are  defined  as  those  who  have  the  most \npowerful  in  households.  Around  22%  of  households  have  female  heads.  However, \naround  two-thirds  of  female  heads  are  either  single  or  divorced.  It  means  that  \nfemale-headed  households  tend  to  have  a  lower  household  size  and  more  difficulties \nthan  male-headed  households.  Households  with  male  heads  and  those  with  female \nheads  have  different  mobility  rates.  However,  the  difference  is  not  very  large.  During \n2010\u20132014, 35% of female-headed households and 41% of male-headed households \nescaped from the bottom income quintile.  \n\nIncome  mobility  is  correlated  with  the  age  of  the  household  head.  Households  with \nyoung  heads  are  substantially  less  likely  to  be  mobile  than  those  with  older  heads. \nDuring 2010\u20132014 39% of households with heads aged 31\u201360 moved from the bottom \nquintile  to  a  higher  quintile,  while  only  16%  of  households  with  heads  aged  below  31 \nmoved  from  the  bottom  quintile  to  a  higher  quintile.  Interviews  also  show  that  young \npeople have lower experiences and find it more difficult to have upward mobility.  \n\nEducation  plays  an  important  role  in  obtaining  better  employment  and  earnings.  The \nreturns  to  education  have  consistently  been  found  to  be  high  in  both  developed  and \ndeveloping  countries  (Psacharopoulos  and  Partinos  2004;  Schultz  1997,  2002). \nFigure 4 shows the important role of education in Viet Nam, especially post-secondary \neducation  (college  and  above)  in  income  mobility.  In  2010\u20132014,  71%  of  households \nwith  post-secondary  heads  moved  from  the  bottom  to  a  higher  income  quintile.  \nFor  households  with  low-education  heads,  these  corresponding  figures  are  only  31% \nand 35%. \n\nFigure 4: Percentage of Households Moving up from the Lowest Income Quintile \nto a Higher Income Quintile \n\nSource: Estimates from the Viet Nam Household Living Standard Surveys. \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 722 \n \n\nLam and Cuong \n\nTable  1  presents  a  more  detailed  analysis  of  income  mobility  during  2010\u20132014.  In \nTable  A.1  in  the  Appendix,  we  present  the  analysis  of  mobility  during  2004\u20132008  for \ncomparison.  Overall,  the  mobility  trend  does  not  change  significantly  over  time.  To \navoid repetition, we use the results of income mobility in 2010\u20132014 for interpretation.  \n\nIn addition to income mobility from the 20% lowest income quintile to a higher income \nquintile, Table 1 presents the mobility from the 40% lowest income quintiles to a higher \nincome quintile. The trend of mobility from the 40% lowest income quintiles is similar to \nthe  trend  of  mobility  from  the  20%  lowest  income  quintile.  Households  with  female, \nyoung, and low education heads are less likely to move up than households with male, \nolder,  and  high  education  heads.  Rural  and  ethnic  minority  households  are  also  less \nlikely to move up. It should be noted that the proportion of mobility in the higher income \nquintiles is lower. This means that it is more difficult to move up when households have \nhigh income or belong to a high-income quintile.  \n\nWe also look at the downward mobility from a higher income quintile to lower income \nquintiles.  Households  with  young  heads  are  more  likely  to  fall  down.  Education  plays \nan important role to reduce the downward mobility of households. Kinh/Hoa and urban \nhouseholds  are  less  likely  to  have  downward  mobility  than  ethnic  minority  and  rural \nhouseholds.  \n\nIn the last two columns of these tables, we estimate the absolute and relative income \nmobility indexes (Fields and Ok 1996, 1999). The absolute change index is equal to the \naverage  of  the  absolute  difference  between  the  2010  income  and  the  2014  income. \nThe  relative  change  index  is  equal  to  the  average  of  the  absolute  change  divided  \nby the per capita income in the base year (i.e., 2010 in Table 1).3 Table 1 shows that \nfemale-headed  households  have  lower  mobility  than  male-headed  households. \nHouseholds with young heads are less likely to be mobile than those with older heads. \nHouseholds with high education heads have a higher absolute mobility than those with \nlow  education.  However,  since  the  base  income  of  households  with  high  education \nheads is higher, their relative mobility is lower. \n\nTable  2  presents  ordinary  least  squares  (OLS)  regression  of  the  probability  of  \nupward and downward income mobility during 2010\u20132014. The regression analysis for \n2004\u20132008 is presented in Table A.2 in the Appendix. Unlike the descriptive analysis in \nTable 1,  an  estimated  coefficient  of  an  explanatory  variable  in  regression  reflects \nthe partial  correlation  between  this  variable  and  the  dependent  variable  once  other \nexplanatory  variables  in  the  regression  are  controlled  for.  It  shows  that  sex  and  age \nof household  heads  are  not  strongly  correlated  with  income  mobility  after  other \nexplanatory variables are controlled for.  \n\nCompared with the Kinh and Hoa, ethnic minorities are more likely to move down but \nless likely to move up in income mobility. Households with higher-education heads are \nmore likely to move up and less likely to move down. They are also more mobile than \nhouseholds with lower-education heads. However, for households in the bottom quintile \nand the top quintile, the education of household heads is not significant in regression of \nincome mobility. This might be because of the small sample size of the bottom and top \nquintiles used in the regressions.  \n\n \n\n                                                \n3  More specifically, the average absolute income change is computed as follows: \n\n, and \n\n\ud835\udc56\n is the \nthe relative absolute income change is computed as follows: \n\u2212 \ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc57\n\ufffd\n\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc53\nincome level of individual or household j in the initial (i) or final (f) period. n is the number of individuals \nor households in the data set.  \n\n\ud835\udc53\n\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc57=1\n\ud835\udc3c = \u2211 \ufffd\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc57\n\n\ud835\udc3c =\n\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc57=1\n\u2211\n\n\ud835\udc56\n\u2212 \ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc57\n\n\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc57\n\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\n\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc57\n\n1\n\ud835\udc53\n\ud835\udc5b\n, where \n\ud835\udc57=1\n\ud835\udc5b \u2211 \ufffd\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc57\n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 722 \n \n\nLam and Cuong \n\nTable 1: Income Mobility of Households during 2010\u20132014 \n\n% Moving Up from the \n20% Bottom in 2010 to a \nHigher Quintile in 2014 \n\n% Moving up from the \n40% Bottom in 2010 to a \nHigher Quintile in 2014 \n\n% Moving Down from the \n40% Top in 2010 to a \nLower Quintile in 2014 \n\n% Moving Down from the \n20% Top in 2010 to a \nLower Quintile in 2014 \n\nAbsolute Change in per \nCapita Income 2010\u20132014 \n(Fields and Ok Index) \n\nRelative Change  \nin per Capita Income \n2010\u20132014 \n\n \nSex of household head \n\n \n\nMale \nFemale \n\nAge of household head \nAge 15\u201330 \nAge 31\u201360 \n\nEducation of household \nhead \n\n< Primary \n\nPrimary \nLower-secondary \n\nUpper-secondary \n\nPost-secondary \n\nRural/Urban \n\nRural \n\nUrban \nEthnicity of household \nhead \n\nKinh and Hoa \n\nEthnic minorities \n\nTotal \n\n \nSex of household head \n\n \n\nMale \n\nFemale \n\nAge of household head \nAge 15\u201330 \nAge 31\u201360 \n\nEducation of household \nhead \n\n< Primary \n\nPrimary \n\nLower-secondary \n\nUpper-secondary \n\nPost-secondary \nRural/Urban \n\nRural \n\nUrban \n\nEthnicity of household \nhead \nKinh and Hoa \n\nEthnic minorities \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n40.5 \n35.1 \n\n15.6 \n\n39.2 \n\n31.4 \n\n34.7 \n46.9 \n\n42.1 \n\n71.3 \n\n35.8 \n\n45.2 \n \n\n48.7 \n\n18.7 \n\n36.5 \n\n43.0 \n\n36.6 \n\n53.0 \n\n37.5 \n\n \n\n \n\n48.2 \n\n58.4 \n\n38.2 \n\n31.8 \n\n30.9 \n \n\n44.7 \n\n32.0 \n\n \n\n37.9 \n\n47.8 \n\n38.4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n11.9 \n11.9 \n\n16.6 \n\n11.6 \n\n \n\n \n\n19.4 \n\n12.6 \n12.1 \n\n4.7 \n\n3.8 \n\n \n\n15.0 \n\n3.3 \n \n\n9.3 \n\n35.7 \n\n11.9 \n\n61.9 \n\n47.8 \n\n45.5 \n\n51.7 \n\n \n\n \n\n55.6 \n\n60.4 \n\n50.2 \n\n54.1 \n\n43.3 \n \n\n54.5 \n\n46.0 \n\n \n\n51.2 \n\n52.7 \n\n51.3 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n17.8 \n11.0 \n\n2.4 \n\n13.2 \n\n8.1 \n\n8.5 \n11.9 \n\n19.7 \n\n22.7 \n\n10.9 \n\n17.0 \n \n\n13.4 \n\n5.0 \n\n12.6 \n\n5,652.4 \n\n4,257.6 \n\n3,440.5 \n\n4,683.6 \n\n3,355.8 \n\n4,489.3 \n\n4,314.8 \n\n5,544.7 \n\n6,348.2 \n\n4,198.6 \n\n5,656.3 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4,964.0 \n\n2,479.9 \n\n4,597.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n \n\nSource: Estimates from the Viet Nam Household Living Standard Surveys 2004 and 2008. \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 722 \n \n\nLam and Cuong \n\nTable 2: Regression of Income Mobility of Households during 2010\u20132014 \n\nMoving Up from the 20% \nBottom in 2010 to a \nHigher Quintile in 2014 \n\nMoving Up from the 40% \nBottom in 2010 to a \nHigher Quintile in 2014 \n\nMoving Down from the \n40% Top in 2010 to a \nLower Quintile in 2014 \n\nExplanatory Variables \n\nGender of household head \n(male = 1, female = 0) \nAge of household head \n\n \nEthnicity of head  \n(Kinh, Hoa = 0;

Clearly,  more  dependents create  more  burdens for  households \nto increase their income. Agricultural land is not important for income mobility. Having \nmore land might restrict households to agricultural production, and they are less likely \nto move.  \n\nThere are no large differences in income mobility between urban and rural households. \nRegarding  the  regional  variables,  households  in  the  Southeast\u2014the  richest  region \nin Viet  Nam  have  the  highest  income  mobility  than  households  in  other  regions. \nCompared with households in the Red River Delta (the reference group), households in \nthe Northeast, South Central Coast, and Central Highlands are less likely to move up \nfrom the lowest quintile. Households in the Southeast are more likely to move up from \nthe 40% bottom. Regarding downward mobility, households in the North Central Coast \nand Central Highlands are more likely to move down from the high-income quintiles.  \n\n4.  INTRAGENERATIONAL EMPLOYMENT MOBILITY \n\n4.1  Employment Structure \n\nIn  this  section,  we  examine  the  intragenerational  mobility  of  individuals  in  terms  of \nemployment. Table 3 shows the share of individuals aged 15\u201360 by occupation during \n2004\u20132014. The definition of employment is similar to Brand-Weiner et al. (2015). The \ncategories are unskilled manual, skilled manual (e.g., craft and related trades workers, \nmachine  operators),  and  nonmanual  (e.g.,  service  and  sales  workers,  technicians, \nmanagers).  The  nonmanual  occupation  is  considered  highly  skilled.  The  share  of \nunskilled workers decreased remarkably over time. The proportion of individuals aged \n15\u201360 with unskilled employment was 72.3% in 2004 and 45.9% in 2014.  \n\nWe  also  analyze  employment  status  mobility,  which  defines  workers  by  wage \nemployment  and  self-employment.  It  shows  that  the  share  of  self-employed  workers \ndecreased from 66.5% in 2004 to 57.8% in 2014. The share of wage workers increased \nover time, indicating the expansion of the formal sector. \n\nEmployment  is  classified  by  sectors  including  agriculture,  industry,  and  services. \nLaborers  in  the  agriculture  sector  tend  to  have  lower  skills  and  income  than  laborers  \nin  the  other  two  sectors.  During  2004\u20132014,  the  number  of  agricultural  laborers \ndecreased, and they moved to the service and industry sectors. However, in the recent \nyears from 2010 to 2014, the share of agricultural workers did not decrease. It might be \nbecause of the economic slowdown in recent years in Viet Nam.  \n\nTable 3: Employment of Individuals Aged 15\u201360 over Time \n\nOccupation \n\nUnskilled \nManual \n\nSkilled \nManual \n\nNonmanual \n\n72.3 \n\n64.6 \n\n48.1 \n45.9 \n\n15.2 \n\n20.1 \n\n26.8 \n28.7 \n\n12.5 \n\n15.3 \n\n25.1 \n25.3 \n\nEmployment \n\nSelf-\nemployed \n\nWage \nEarner \n\n66.5 \n\n63.5 \n\n60.5 \n57.8 \n\n33.5 \n\n36.5 \n\n39.5 \n42.2 \n\nYear \n\n2004 \n\n2008 \n\n2010 \n2014 \n\nSector \n\nAgriculture \n\nIndustry  Service \n\n52.7 \n\n49.4 \n\n42.9 \n44.5 \n\n19.8 \n\n22.1 \n\n25.5 \n24.3 \n\n27.6 \n\n28.6 \n\n31.6 \n31.2 \n\nSource: Estimates from the Viet Nam Household Living Standard Surveys 2004, 2008, 2010, and 2014. \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 722 \n \n\nLam and Cuong \n\nTable  4  presents  the  employment  structure  of  workers  by  different  characteristics  in \n2014. Men are more likely to have skilled, wage, and nonfarm jobs than women. There \nis no difference in occupation by skills between young and older people.

Having a high education helps people find a skilled or nonmanual job and \nreduce  the  downward  change  from  a  skilled  to  an  unskilled  job.  Rural  people  and \nethnic  minority  people  are  less  likely  to  move  up  but  more  likely  to  move  down  in \nemployment than urban and Kinh/Hoa people.  \n\n4.3  Regression of Employment Mobility \n\nTable  6  presents  the  regressions  of  mobility  of  occupation  during  2010\u20132014.  The \ndependent  variables  include  the  change  in  occupation,  employment  status,  and \nworking sectors. The analysis for 2004\u20132008 is presented in Table A.4 in the Appendix. \nIt shows that men are less likely to move down from skilled and nonmanual occupation \nto unskilled occupation than women. They are more likely to move from self-employed \nto employed (wage) work than women.  \n\nAge  is  not  correlated  with  the  occupation  movement.  However,  there  is  a  negative \nrelationship  between  age  and  the  probability  of  moving  from  self-employed  to  wage \njobs.  As  age  increases,  the  probability  to  move  from  self-employed  to  wage  jobs \ndecreases at a decreasing rate. \n\nEducation  plays  an  important  role  in  labor  mobility  from  unskilled  to  skilled \nemployment.  Compared  with  people  with  no  education,  having  a  post-secondary \ndegree  increases  the  probability  of  moving  up  from  unskilled  to  skilled  or  nonmanual \noccupation  by  0.19.  It  also  reduces  the  probability  of  moving  down  from  skilled  and \nmanual occupation to unskilled occupation by 0.23.  \n\n \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 722 \n \n\nLam and Cuong \n\nTable 6: Regression of Employment Mobility of Individuals during 2010\u20132014 \n\nMoving Up from Unskilled \nto Skilled and Nonmanual \n\nMoving Down from Skilled \nand Nonmanual to Unskilled \n\nMoving from Self-\nemployed to Wage Jobs \n\nDependent Variables \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nExplanatory Variables \n\nMale = 1, female = 0 \n\nAge \n\n \nAge squared \n\nEthnic minorities  \n(yes = 1;

The \nregression  results  show  that  education  is  not  correlated  with  the  movement  from  \nself-employed  to  employed  work  as  well  as  the  movement  from  agricultural  to \nfrom \nnonagricultural  work.  However,  higher  education  reduces \nemployed to self-employed work and from nonagricultural to agricultural work.  \n\nthe  movement \n\nOverall,  household  composition  such  as  household  size  and  age  structure  is  not \ncorrelated  with  employment  mobility  of  household  members.  However,  having  more \nagricultural  land  increases  the  movement  from  employed  to  self-employed  work  and \nthe  movement  from  nonagricultural  to  agricultural  work.  Urban  and  regional  variables \nalso matter to mobility of employment, especially the mobility between agriculture and \nnonagriculture  sectors.  Urban  people  tend  to  move  up  from  unskilled  to  skilled  and \nnonmanual  occupation  than  rural  people.  Compared  with  workers  in  the  Red  River \nDelta (the reference group), workers in the North Central Coast, South Central Coast, \nand  Southeast  are  more  likely  to  move  up  from  unskilled  to  skilled  and  nonmanual. \nWorkers  in  the  northern  mountains  including  the  Northeast  and  Northwest  are  less \nlikely  to  move  from  self-employed  to  wage  jobs  as  well  as  move  from  agricultural  to \nnonagricultural employment. Workers in the Central Highlands are more likely to transit \nfrom  wage  jobs  to  self-employment,  but  less  likely  to  move  from  agricultural  to \nnonagricultural employment.  \n\n5.  INTERGENERATIONAL MOBILITY \n\n5.1  Intergenerational Employment Mobility  \n\nIn  this  section,  we  analyze  the  intergenerational  mobility  of  employment\u2014that  is,  a \ncorrelation  between  parents\u2019  employment  and  children\u2019s  employment.  We  use  the \nsample of children and parents who are still working, and children aged from 15 to 60. \nWe  define  parent  as  the  one  with  higher  wages\u2014that  is,  if  the  mother  has  higher \nwages than the father, the mother is defined as the parent and vice versa.  \n\nFigure  6  shows  that,  in  2004,  among  children  who  had  a  parent  with  unskilled \noccupation,  19%  were  able  to  find  skilled  or  nonmanual  jobs.  In  other  words,  81%  of \nchildren  had  unskilled  occupations  like  their  parents.  Occupation  mobility  greatly \nimproved  in  2014:  38%  of  children  with  unskilled  parents  found  skilled  or  nonmanual \noccupation.  One  reason  for  this  upward  mobility  is  the  increase  in  skilled  and \nnonmanual employment during 2004\u20132014.  \n\nThe  improvement  in  occupation  mobility  is  higher  for  females  and  older  people  than \nmales  and  young  people.  Education  plays  an  important  role  for  improvement  in \nintergenerational  mobility  of  occupational  skills.  With  post-secondary  degree  holders, \n80%  of  people  whose  parents  are  unskilled  have  skilled  or  nonmanual  occupation. \nUrban and Kinh/Hoa people are more likely to have skilled and nonmanual occupation \nthan rural and ethnic minorities. \n\nTable  7  presents  the  intergenerational  mobility  of  employment  in  2014  by  different \ntypes of employment and different characteristics of individuals. This table presents not \nonly upward but also downward intergenerational mobility of employment. The analysis \nof  intergenerational  employment  mobility  in  2004  is  presented  in  Table  A.5  in  the \nAppendix.  \n\n \n\n \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 722 \n \n\nLam and Cuong \n\nFigure 6: Intergenerational Mobility from Unskilled Parents to Skilled Children \n\nSource: Estimates from the Viet Nam Household Living Standard Surveys 2004 and 2014. \n\n \n\nIt shows that of children whose parents have skilled or nonmanual occupation, 27.7% \nhad unskilled occupation. This is regarded as the downward intergenerational mobility. \nThis downward rate is very high for ethnic minorities\u201467% of ethnic minority children \nhad  unskilled  occupations  even  though  their  parents  had  skilled  or  nonmanual \noccupations.  The  Kinh/Hoa  and  urban  people,  especially  those  with  high  education, \nhave a remarkably lower downward rate of intergenerational skills. \n\nTable 7: Intergenerational Mobility of Employment in 2014 \n\nCharacteristics  \nof Children \n\nSkill Upward: Skilled \nChildren and Unskilled \nParents \n\nSkill Downward: Unskilled \nChildren and Skilled \nParents \n\nEmployment Upward:  \nWage Children and  \nSelf-employed Parents \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSex \n\nMale \n\nFemale \n\nAge \nAge 15\u201330 \n\nAge 31\u201360 \n\nEducation \n\nLess primary \n\nPrimary \n\nLower secondary \nUpper secondary \n\nPost secondary \n\nRural/urban \n\nRural \n\nUrban \nEthnicity \n\nKinh and Hoa \n\nEthnic minorities \n\nTotal \n\n35.02 \n\n42.02 \n\n \n35.92 \n\n52.81 \n\n14.43 \n\n22.51 \n\n29.22 \n41.71 \n\n78.58 \n\n \n\n \n\n34.94 \n\n51.99 \n \n\n49.91 \n\n10.86 \n\n37.62 \n\n30.14 \n\n23.97 \n\n \n28.84 \n\n17.69 \n\n41.38 \n\n44.71 \n\n43.71 \n29.06 \n\n8.42 \n\n \n\n \n\n36.17 \n\n12.22 \n \n\n23.47 \n\n67.47 \n\n27.68 \n\n44.12 \n\n46.13 \n\n \n43.66 \n\n55.11 \n\n30.38 \n\n37.08 \n\n30.74 \n43.64 \n\n73.57 \n\n \n\n \n\n41.03 \n\n59.63 \n \n\n54.52 \n\n17.77 \n\n44.89 \n\ncontinued on next page \n\n17 \n \n\n\fCharacteristics  \nof Children \n\nEmployment Downward: \nSelf-employed Children \nand Wage Parents \n\nSector Upward: \nNonagricultural Children \nand Agricultural Parents \n\nSector Downward: \nAgricultural Children and \nNonagricultural Parents \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nADBI Working Paper 722 \n \n\nTable 7 continued \n\nSex \n\nMale \nFemale \n\nAge \n\nAge 15\u201330 \n\nAge 31\u201360 \n\nEducation \n\nLess primary \nPrimary \n\nLower secondary \n\nUpper secondary \n\nPost secondary \n\nRural/urban \nRural \n\nUrban \n\nEthnicity \n\nKinh and Hoa \n\nEthnic minorities \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n20.27 \n24.84 \n\n22.60 \n\n16.13 \n\n21.18 \n17.04 \n\n39.71 \n\n25.20 \n\n10.16 \n\n \n26.20 \n\n14.17 \n\n19.54 \n\n45.43 \n\n22.02 \n\nLam and Cuong \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n13.84 \n13.76 \n\n14.32 \n\n  9.82 \n\n17.88 \n14.80 \n\n25.86 \n\n16.78 \n\n  4.82 \n\n \n21.52 \n\n  3.87 \n\n11.95 \n\n45.33 \n\n13.80 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n40.05 \n45.44 \n\n40.39 \n\n57.81 \n\n19.76 \n29.25 \n\n31.56 \n\n50.51 \n\n76.91 \n\n \n40.52 \n\n53.24 \n\n54.87 \n\n14.82 \n\n42.02 \n\nSource: Estimates from the Viet Nam Household Living Standard Surveys 2014. \n\nOver  time,  there  has  been  an  expansion  in  the  formal  sector  as  well  as  the  nonfarm \nsector.  The  proportion  of  wage  workers  and  nonagricultural  workers  tend  to  increase \nover time. As a result, 44.9% of children with self-employed parents found wage jobs. \nOn the other hand, around 22% of children with wage parents had self-employed work. \nThe  intergenerational  movement  from  agriculture  to  nonagriculture  sectors  is  higher \nthan the intergenerational movement from nonagriculture to agriculture sectors.  \n\n5.2  Intergenerational Correlations of Earnings \n\nAn  important  issue  in  intergenerational  mobility  is  the  estimate  of  intergenerational \ncorrelations  of  earnings  or  the  intergenerational  elasticity.  In  this  study,  we  use  OLS \nregression to estimate intergenerational elasticity. More specifically, we regress log of \nannual wages of children on log of annual wages of parents as follows: \n\n. \n\n2\n\nis \n\n+ \ud835\udf00\nthe  estimate  of \n\nlog  of  annual  wages  of  parents \n\n\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\u210e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udefc + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54\ufffd\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ufffd + \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\u210e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b + \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\u210e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\nThe  coefficient  of \nthe \nintergenerational  elasticity.  The  above  model  is  widely  used  to  estimate  the \nintergenerational elasticity of earning in empirical studies (Black and Devereux 2010). \nSince  we  do  not  have  data  on  permanent  income  in  the  VHLSSs,  we  have  to  use \nincome  in  the  year  of  surveys.  To  correct  for  this  life-cycle  problem,  in  which  income \nvaries  across  age,  we  control  age  of  children  in  regression.  We  estimate  the \nintergenerational  elasticity  using  pooled  samples  of  VHLSSs  2004,  2008,  2010,  and \n2014. Tables  A6  to  A8  in  the  Appendix  present the regression  results.  Figures  7 to  9 \npresent  the  estimates  of  the  intergenerational  elasticity  or  the  intergenerational \ncoefficient for different groups of people.  \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 722 \n \n\nLam and Cuong \n\nFigure  7  presents  the  intergenerational  elasticity  between  fathers  and  sons/daughters \nand the intergenerational elasticity between mothers and sons/daughters. It shows that \nthe  intergenerational  elasticity  is  quite  similar  between  different  pairs  of  parents  and \nchildren. However, the intergenerational elasticity is higher between parents and sons \nthan  between  parents  and  daughters.  It  means  that  girls  tend  to  have  higher  income \nmobility than boys. \n\nIn Figure 8, we estimate the intergenerational elasticity of children\u2019s wages with respect \nto the parent with higher wages. The intergenerational elasticity is 0.36, which implies \nthat  if  the  parents\u2019  wage  increases  by  1%,  their  children\u2019s  wage  increases  by  0.36%. \nThe  higher  value  of  the  intergenerational  elasticity  means  low  intergenerational \nmobility.  This  value  is  similar  to  several  countries,  such  as  Germany  and  Japan,  but \nlower  than  France,  the  United  Kingdom,  and  the  US,  and  higher  than  Canada, \nAustralia,  and  the  Nordic  countries  (according  to  the  estimates  in  Corak  2013a). \nViet Nam  also  has  a  lower  intergenerational  elasticity  than  several  countries  such  as \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (0.62  according  to  Gong  et  al.  2012),  Brazil  (0.58 \naccording to Ferreira and Veloso 2006), and Malaysia (0.54 according to Grawe 2004).  \n\nFigure 7: Intergenerational Elasticity between Father, Mother and Son,  \nand Daughter \n\n \nSource:  Estimates  from  the  Viet  Nam  Household  Living  Standard  Surveys  2004,  2008, \n2010, and 2014. \n\nFigure  8  shows  that  the  intergenerational  mobility  was  slightly  higher  in  2014  than  in \n2004. The  intergenerational  mobility  is  higher for  urban  and  Kinh/Hoa  people  than for \nrural and ethnic minority people. \n\nFigure  9  shows  a  higher  intergenerational  mobility  for  women  than  men.  The \nintergenerational  elasticity  is  very  similar  between  young  and  older  people.  Figure  9 \nshows  the  important role  of  education  in  improving  the  intergenerational mobility. The \nintergenerational  elasticity  for  children  without  education  degrees  and  those  with  \npost-secondary degrees is 0.51 and 0.17, respectively.  \n\n \n\n \n\n19 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 722 \n \n\nLam and Cuong \n\nFigure 8: Intergenerational Elasticity by Rural/Urban and Ethnicity \n\n \nSource:  Estimates  from  the  Viet  Nam  Household  Living  Standard  Surveys  2004,  2008, \n2010, and 2014. \n\nFigure 9: Intergenerational Elasticity by Sex, Age, and Education \n\n \nSource:  Estimates  from  the  Viet  Nam  Household  Living  Standard  Surveys  2004,  2008, \n2010, and 2014. \n\n5.3  Regression of Intergenerational Mobility of Employment  \n\nFinally, Table 8 presents the OLS regression of intergenerational employment mobility \nusing pooled samples of VHLSSs 2004, 2008, 2010, and 2014. It shows that men are \nless likely to have upward intergenerational mobility and more likely to have downward \nintergenerational mobility than women. There is an inverted-U shape between upward \nintergenerational mobility and age. As age increases, the probability of having a better \njob  than  their  parents  increases.  However,  after  achieving  a  peak,  the  probability  of \nhaving a better job than their parents decreases with age.  \n\n \n\n \n\n20 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 722 \n \n\nLam and Cuong \n\nTable

intergenerational  mobility  than  the  Kinh  and  \nHoa.  Education  plays  an  important  role  in  intergenerational  employment.  Better \nthe  \nincreases \neducation \ndownward \nintergenerational  mobility,  especially  having  post-secondary  degrees \nimproves  the  intergenerational  employment  substantially  than  having  other  lower \neducational degrees.  \n\nintergenerational  mobility  and \n\nthe  upward \n\nreduces \n\nUrban  and  regional  variables  also  contribute  to  intergenerational  mobility.  Compared \nwith  rural  people,  urban  people  are  more  likely  to  have  skilled  occupations  when  \nhaving  unskilled  parents.  They  are  also  more  likely  to  transition  from  agricultural  to \nnonagricultural employment. Compared with people in Red River Delta (the reference \ngroup),  people  in  other  regions  such  as  in  the  Northwest,  Northeast,  Central  Coast, \nCentral  Highlands,  and  Mekong  River  Delta  have  a  higher  probability  of  downward \nintergenerational mobility and a lower probability.  \n\n6.  CONCLUSIONS \n\nthis  study,  we  examine \n\nintergenerational  mobility  of \nintragenerational  and \nIn \nemployment and income in Viet Nam in 2004\u20132008 and in 2010\u20132014. We find rather \nhigh mobility across income quintiles: 45% of households in the bottom quintile in 2004 \nmoved  to  a  higher  income  quintile  in  2008.  However,  the  income  mobility  decreased \nover time; and 37% of households in the bottom quintile in 2010 were able to move to a \nhigher income quintile in 2014.  \n\nCompared with the Kinh and Hoa, ethnic minorities are more likely to move down but \nless  likely  to  move  up  across  income  quintiles.  Households  with  higher  education \nheads  are  more  likely  to  move  up  and  less  likely  to  move  down.  They  are  also  more \nmobile  than  households  with  lower  education  heads.  Households  with  more  children \nand  more  elderly  people  tend  to  have  lower  income  mobility.  They  are  less  likely  to \nmove up to a higher quintile, but more likely to move down to a lower income quintile. \nAgricultural land is not important for income mobility. Having more lands might restrict \nhouseholds to agricultural production, and they are less likely to move.  \n\nThere was high mobility by occupational skills but less mobility by employment status \nand  sectors.  Among  the  unskilled  workers  in  2004,  17%  of  them  became  skilled \nmanual  or  nonmanual  workers  in  2008.  The  upward  mobility  of  occupation  increased \nduring  2010\u20132014.  Of  the  unskilled  workers  in  2010,  24%  had  a  skilled  manual  or \nnonmanual job in 2014. Men are less likely to move down from skilled and nonmanual \noccupation  to  unskilled  occupation  than  women.  They  are  more  likely  to  move  from \nself-employed  to  wage  work  than  women.  Education  plays  an  important  role  in  labor \nmobility from unskilled to skilled employment. Compared with people with no education, \nhaving a post-secondary degree increases the probability of moving up from unskilled \nto  skilled  or  nonmanual  occupation  by  0.19.  It  also  reduces  the  probability  of  moving \ndown from skilled and manual occupation to unskilled occupation by 0.23. Having more \nagricultural  land  increases  the  movement  from  employed  to  self-employed  works  and \nthe movement from nonagricultural to agricultural works.  \n\nThe  intergenerational  elasticity  of  earnings  for  parents  and  children  is  estimated  at \naround  0.36.  The  intergenerational  elasticity  is  very  similar  for  2004  and  2014.  The \nintergenerational mobility is higher for urban and the Kinh/Hoa than for rural and ethnic \nminority  people.  The  analysis  shows  the  important  role  of  education  in  improving \nintergenerational mobility. The intergenerational elasticity for children without education \ndegrees and those with post-secondary degrees is 0.51 and 0.17, respectively.  \n\n24 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 722 \n \n\nLam and Cuong \n\nIntergenerational  mobility  of  occupation  has  improved  in  Viet  Nam.  In  2004,  among \nchildren  who  had  a  parent  with  unskilled  occupation,  19%  of  them  were  able  to  find \nskilled  or  nonmanual  jobs.  In  other  words,  81%  of  children  had  unskilled  occupations \nlike  their  parents.  Occupation  mobility  greatly  improved  in  2014:  38%  of  children  with \nunskilled  parents  found  skilled  or  nonmanual  occupation.  One  reason  for  this  upward \nmobility  is  the  increase  in  skilled  and  nonmanual  employment  during  2004\u20132014. \nEducation  plays  an \nintergenerational  mobility  of \noccupational  skills. With  a  post-secondary  degree,  80%  of  people  whose  parents  are \nunskilled  have  skilled  or  nonmanual  occupation.  The  urban  and  Kinh/Hoa  people  are \nmore likely to have skilled and nonmanual occupation than rural and ethnic minorities. \n\nimportant  role \n\nimproving \n\nin \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n25 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 722 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nLam and Cuong \n\nBaulch, B. and D.

It finds rather  high mobility  across \nincome  quintiles.  There  was  high  mobility  of  individuals  by  occupational  skills  but  less \nmobility  by  employment  status  and  sectors.  The  upward  mobility  of  occupation  increased \nover  time  because  of  the  increase  in  skilled  occupation.  The  intergenerational  elasticity  of \nearnings  for  parents  and  children  is  estimated  at  around  0.36.  The  intergenerational \nelasticity  is  very  similar  for  2004  and  2014.  Education  plays  an  important  role  in  improving \nintergenerational  mobility.  The  intergenerational  elasticity  for  children  without  education \ndegrees  and  those  with  post-secondary  degrees  is  0.51  and  0.17,  respectively.  With  a \npostsecondary  degree,  80%  of  people  whose  parents  are  unskilled  have  skilled  or \nnonmanual occupation. \n \nKeywords: social mobility, intragenerational mobility, intergenerational mobility, \noccupational mobility, income mobility, Viet Nam \n \nJEL Classification: J62 \n \n", " \n"]}
