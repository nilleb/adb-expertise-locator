INTRODUCTION \nThere  are  different  definitions  of  social  mobility  (e.g.,  Behrman  2000;  Torche  \n2015). Social mobility can refer to movement of individuals and households across \ndifferent  social  positions.  Social  mobility  includes  intergenerational  mobility  and \nintragenerational  mobility.  Intergenerational  mobility  is  the  change  in  position  of  a \nperson or a household as compared with previous generations, while intragenerational \nmobility is the change in position of a person or a household over time. Social mobility \ncan be measured in terms of education, employment, and income. The movement can \nbe downward or upward. \nThere is an association between social mobility and inequality. In a society with high-\nincome inequality, there are very rich as well as very poor households, and family \nbackground  can  be  an  important  factor  in  determining  income  of  children  (Corak \n2013a).  For  example,  being  born  in  a  rich  family  can  result  in  better  health  and \neducation for children. Family resources and networks also affect children\u2019s networks \nand employment (Corak 2013a). Children born in rich families are more likely to have \ngood jobs and high earnings. As a result, high inequality can result in low social \nmobility  including  both  intragenerational  and  intergenerational  mobility.  The  invert \nassociation between intergenerational mobility and inequality is described by the Great \nGatsby curve (Corak 2013b). Countries with high-income inequality tend to have higher \nintergenerational elasticity or low-income mobility across the generations.  \nViet Nam has achieved high economic growth during the recent decades. Poverty has \nsignificantly decreased over time. The proportion of people below the expenditure \npoverty line decreased from 58.1% in 1993 to 14.5% in 2008 and 10% in 2012. Poverty \nrate has declined in all population groups and in all geographic regions (World Bank \n2013).1 However, poverty rate remains very high in remote and mountainous areas \nwhere there is a high proportion of ethnic minorities. In some remote areas, more than \n80% of people still live below the poverty line (Nguyen 2011; Lanjouw et al. 2013). \nThere is a large gap in the living standards of ethnic minorities and the Kinh people. \nThe absolute income gap between the top income quintile and the bottom income \nquintile also tends to increase over time.  \nThere is an influential view that equality in opportunity can improve income equality. \nPoor as well as rich children should have the same opportunities for education and \nbetter employment (Black and Devereux 2010). Understanding social mobility is very \nimportant to improve equality in opportunities and welfare in Viet Nam. Thus, this study \nprovides a descriptive analysis of the situation and trend of social mobility in Viet Nam, \nand subsequently examines factors associated with social mobility. More specifically, \nthis  study  has  three  objectives.  The  first  is  to  present  the  descriptive  analysis  of \nintragenerational mobility of income and employment mobility in Viet Nam. The second \nis to analyze the intergenerational mobility of employment and earnings. The third  \nis  to  analyze  the  association  of  different  factors,  especially  education,  with  the \nintragenerational  and  intergenerational  mobility.  Data  used  for  this  analysis  are  \nfrom the Viet Nam Household Living Standard Surveys (VHLSS) in 2004, 2008, 2010, \nand 2014.  \nThere is a large number of studies on intergenerational mobility (for review e.g., see \nBlack and Devereux 2010; Solon 2013; and Torche 2015). Most studies focus on the \nanalysis in the United States (US) and other developed countries. There are fewer \nempirical  evidences  on  intergenerational  mobility  in  developing  countries,  possibly \n                                                \n1  For poverty measurement in Viet Nam, see for example Nguyen (2011) and Nguyen and Tran (2014).  \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 722  Lam and Cuong \n \nbecause  of  less  available  data  sets  in  these  countries.  In  Viet  Nam,  two  studies \nestimate the intergenerational elasticity. Using the VHLSS 1998, Hertz et al. (2008) \nestimate  the  elasticity  of  education  between  parents  and  children  at  0.58.  Emran  \nand Shilpi (2011) find a high correlation of intergenerational occupation in Viet Nam \nusing  the  VHLSS  1993.  Most  recently,  Brand-Weiner  et  al.  (2015)  examine  the \nintragenerational mobility of income and occupation using VHLSS in 2004 and 2008, \nshowing rather high-income mobility in Viet Nam. However, the mobility of employment \nacross sectors (agriculture, service, and industry) is small. Several studies look at \npoverty transition of households over time (e.g., Nguyen 2012; Baulch and Vu 2010; \nNguyen et al. 2015). Overall, these studies find that ethnic minority and low education \nhouseholds tend to be more chronically poor than the Kinh majority and high education \nhouseholds.  \nCompared with previous studies on social mobility in Viet Nam, this study has several \ndifferences.  First,  this  study  examines  not  only  intragenerational  mobility  but  also \nintergenerational mobility in both occupational and earning outcomes. Previous studies \nlook at either intragenerational mobility or intergenerational mobility. Second, we use \nmost of the recent VHLSS (from 2004 to 2014) to examine the change in social mobility \nover  time.  Finally,  using  regressions,  we  are  able  to  investigate  the  association \nbetween several socioeconomic factors and social mobility.  \nThis  paper  is  structured  into  five  sections.  After  the  Introduction,  the  second  \nsection introduces the VHLSS data set. The third section presents income inequality \nand  intragenerational  income  mobility  of  households  in  Viet  Nam.  The  third  \nsection analyzes the intragenerational occupational mobility of individuals over time. \nThe fourth section presents the analysis of intergenerational mobility. Finally, the fifth \nsection concludes. \n2.  DATA SETS \nThis study uses sets of VHLSS in 2004, 2008, 2010, and 2014. These surveys were \nconducted by the General Statistics Office (GSO) of Viet Nam with technical assistance \nfrom the World Bank. VHLSSs are conducted every 2 years. The latest survey was \nreleased in 2014. In this study, we use the four VHLSSs mainly to analyze the changes \nin 2004\u20132008 and in 2010\u20132014. The surveys contain household-level and individual-\nlevel data. Data include basic demography, employment and labor force participation, \neducation, health, income, expenditure, housing, fixed assets and durable goods, and \nparticipation of households in poverty alleviation programs.  \nThe  number  of  households  sampled  in  VHLSS  2004,  2008,  2010,  and  2014  is  \n9,188, 9,189, 9,399, and 9,398, respectively. There were 40,437 individuals from the \nsampled households for VHLSS 2004, 38,253 for VHLSS 2008, 36,999 for VHLSS \n2010, and 35,520 for 2014. The VHLSSs are representative at the urban/rural and \nregional levels. There were 1,817 panel households during the VHLSS 2004 and the \nVHLSS 2008, 1,817 households for VHLSS 2010, and 1,813 households for VHLSS \n2014. However, there are no panel data between the VHLSS 2008 and the VHLSS \n2010. The VHLSSs for 2010 and 2012 used the new sample frame (from the 2009 \nPopulation and Housing Census). As a result, there is no link between the VHLSS \n2010 and the earlier VHLSSs. \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 722  Lam and Cuong \n \n3.  HOUSEHOLD INCOME MOBILITY  \n3.1  Income Inequality \nInequality in Viet Nam, which is measured by the Gini index, has been quite stable over \ntime. Inequality increased lightly in 2008 and 2010 and decreased in 2012 and 2014. \nFigure 1 presents the income and expenditure Gini indexes during 2004\u20132014. Income \ninequality is higher than expenditure inequality, but the difference is small. In 2014, the \nincome and expenditure Gini indexes were 0.39 and 0.35, respectively. It should be \nnoted that household surveys can underestimate income inequality since they do not \ncapture the richest people of the country. \nFigure 1: Income and Expenditure Inequality over Time \n \nSource: Estimates from the Viet Nam Household Living Standard Surveys. \nAlthough the Gini coefficient did not increase over time, the gap in income between \ngroups increased over time. The absolute per capita income gap between urban and \nrural households increased from D4,754 ($213) in 2004 to D6,344 ($288) in 2014 \n(Figure 2). The gap between the Kinh/Hoa and ethnic minorities is larger. Not only the \nabsolute income gap but also the relative income gap increased over time. The ratio of \nper capita income of the Kinh/Hoa to that of ethnic minorities increased from 2.1 in \n2004 to 2.3 in 2014.2  \nThe left panel of Figure 3 presents the per capita income of all households and the \n40% lowest income households. The Sustainable Development Goals on inequality is \nto \u201cby 2030, progressively achieve and sustain income growth of the bottom 40 per \ncent of the population at a rate higher than the national average.\u201d During the past 10 \nyears from 2004 to 2014, the average annual growth rate of real per capita income of \nthe bottom 40% of the population is 5.4% per year, while the corresponding rate of the \nnational average is 5.5% per year. To achieve this target, households in lower income \nquintiles should have a higher growth rate of income. \n                                                \n2  There are 54 ethnic groups in Viet Nam, in which the Kinh majority accounts for 85% of the population. \nThe Kinh tends to live in delta areas and has higher living standards than other ethnic minorities. The \nHoa (Chinese) is a rich group and also lives in delta areas. Thus, the Hoa is often grouped with the Kinh \nin studies on household welfare in Viet Nam. \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 722  Lam and Cuong \n \nFigure 2: Per Capita Income by Urban/Rural and Ethnicity \n \nNote: Per capita income is measured in January 2004 prices. \nSource: Estimates from the Viet Nam Household Living Standard Surveys. \nFigure 3: Per Capita Income by Income Quintiles \n \nNote: Per capita income is measured in January 2004 prices. \nSource: Estimates from the Viet Nam Household Living Standard Surveys. \nThe right panel of Figure 3 shows an important point of income inequality in Viet Nam. \nThere are no large gaps in per capita income among those in the bottom quintile to the \nnearest richest quintile. However, there is a large jump in per capita income from the \nnear richest to the richest quintile. It implies that there are very rich households in  \nthe richest quintile, and it would be very difficult to move to the richest quintile from a \nlower quintile. \n3.2  Income Mobility \nTo examine income mobility, we use panel household data from VHLSS 2004 and \nVHLSS 2008, and from VHLSS 2010 and VHLSS 2014. Households are grouped into \nincome quintiles. Figure 4 presents the percentage of households who improved their \nincome level from the bottom income quintile (the 20% lowest income) to a higher \nincome quintile over time by characteristics of household heads. It shows that 45% of \nhouseholds in the bottom quintile in 2004 moved to a higher income quintile in 2008. \nThis figure is 37% during 2010\u20132014. It implies that the mobility of the lowest quintile \nhouseholds tended to decrease over time.  \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 722  Lam and Cuong \n \nUrban  households  are  more  likely  to  move  up  than  rural  households.  The  gap  \nin  income  mobility  is  large  between  the  Kinh/Hoa  and  ethnic  minorities.  During  \n2010\u20132014, around 19% of ethnic minorities in the bottom quintile moved to a higher \nincome quintile, while this figure for the Kinh and Hoa was 49%.  \nIncome mobility of households is also correlated with characteristics of household \nheads. In the VHLSSs, household heads are defined as those who have the most \npowerful in households. Around 22% of households have female heads. However, \naround  two-thirds  of  female  heads  are  either  single  or  divorced.  It  means  that  \nfemale-headed households tend to have a lower household size and more difficulties \nthan male-headed households. Households with male heads and those with female \nheads have different mobility rates. However, the difference is not very large. During \n2010\u20132014, 35% of female-headed households and 41% of male-headed households \nescaped from the bottom income quintile.  \nIncome mobility is correlated with the age of the household head. Households with \nyoung heads are substantially less likely to be mobile than those with older heads. \nDuring 2010\u20132014 39% of households with heads aged 31\u201360 moved from the bottom \nquintile to a higher quintile, while only 16% of households with heads aged below 31 \nmoved from the bottom quintile to a higher quintile. Interviews also show that young \npeople have lower experiences and find it more difficult to have upward mobility.  \nEducation plays an important role in obtaining better employment and earnings. The \nreturns to education have consistently been found to be high in both developed and \ndeveloping  countries  (Psacharopoulos  and  Partinos  2004;  Schultz  1997,  2002). \nFigure 4 shows the important role of education in Viet Nam, especially post-secondary \neducation (college and above) in income mobility. In 2010\u20132014, 71% of households \nwith  post-secondary  heads  moved  from  the  bottom  to  a  higher  income  quintile.  \nFor households with low-education heads, these corresponding figures are only 31% \nand 35%. \nFigure 4: Percentage of Households Moving up from the Lowest Income Quintile \nto a Higher Income Quintile \n \nSource: Estimates from the Viet Nam Household Living Standard Surveys. \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 722  Lam and Cuong \n \nTable 1 presents a more detailed analysis of income mobility during 2010\u20132014. In \nTable A.1 in the Appendix, we present the analysis of mobility during 2004\u20132008 for \ncomparison. Overall, the mobility trend does not change significantly over time. To \navoid repetition, we use the results of income mobility in 2010\u20132014 for interpretation.  \nIn addition to income mobility from the 20% lowest income quintile to a higher income \nquintile, Table 1 presents the mobility from the 40% lowest income quintiles to a higher \nincome quintile. The trend of mobility from the 40% lowest income quintiles is similar to \nthe trend of mobility from the 20% lowest income quintile. Households with female, \nyoung, and low education heads are less likely to move up than households with male, \nolder, and high education heads. Rural and ethnic minority households are also less \nlikely to move up. It should be noted that the proportion of mobility in the higher income \nquintiles is lower. This means that it is more difficult to move up when households have \nhigh income or belong to a high-income quintile.  \nWe also look at the downward mobility from a higher income quintile to lower income \nquintiles. Households with young heads are more likely to fall down. Education plays \nan important role to reduce the downward mobility of households. Kinh/Hoa and urban \nhouseholds are less likely to have downward mobility than ethnic minority and rural \nhouseholds.  \nIn the last two columns of these tables, we estimate the absolute and relative income \nmobility indexes (Fields and Ok 1996, 1999). The absolute change index is equal to the \naverage of the absolute difference between the 2010 income and the 2014 income. \nThe relative change index is equal to the average of the absolute change divided  \nby the per capita income in the base year (i.e., 2010 in Table 1).3 Table 1 shows that \nfemale-headed  households  have  lower  mobility  than  male-headed  households. \nHouseholds with young heads are less likely to be mobile than those with older heads. \nHouseholds with high education heads have a higher absolute mobility than those with \nlow education. However, since the base income of households with high education \nheads is higher, their relative mobility is lower. \nTable  2  presents  ordinary  least  squares  (OLS)  regression  of  the  probability  of  \nupward and downward income mobility during 2010\u20132014. The regression analysis for \n2004\u20132008 is presented in Table A.2 in the Appendix. Unlike the descriptive analysis in \nTable 1,  an  estimated  coefficient  of  an  explanatory  variable  in  regression  reflects \nthe partial correlation between this variable and the dependent variable once other \nexplanatory variables in the regression are controlled for. It shows that sex and age \nof household  heads  are  not  strongly  correlated  with  income  mobility  after  other \nexplanatory variables are controlled for.  \nCompared with the Kinh and Hoa, ethnic minorities are more likely to move down but \nless likely to move up in income mobility. Households with higher-education heads are \nmore likely to move up and less likely to move down. They are also more mobile than \nhouseholds with lower-education heads. However, for households in the bottom quintile \nand the top quintile, the education of household heads is not significant in regression of \nincome mobility. This might be because of the small sample size of the bottom and top \nquintiles used in the regressions.  \n \n                                                \n3  More specifically, the average absolute income change is computed as follows:  , and \n1 \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc56\nthe relative absolute income change is computed as follows:  \ud835\udc3c=\ud835\udc5b\u2211, \ud835\udc57w=1h\ufffde\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc57re \u2212\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc57 \ufffdis the \nincome level of individual or household j in the initial (i) or final (f) \ud835\udc5bperio\ud835\udc53d. n i\ud835\udc56s the\ud835\udc5b num\ud835\udc56ber of ind\ud835\udc56,i\ud835\udc53viduals \n\ud835\udc3c=\u2211\ud835\udc57=1\ufffd\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc57 \u2212\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc57\ufffd\ufffd\u2211\ud835\udc57=1\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc57\nor households in the data set.  \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 722  Lam and Cuong \n \nTable 1: Income Mobility of Households during 2010\u20132014 \n% Moving Up from the  % Moving up from the  % Moving Down from the \n20% Bottom in 2010 to a  40% Bottom in 2010 to a  40% Top in 2010 to a \nHigher Quintile in 2014  Higher Quintile in 2014  Lower Quintile in 2014 \n \nSex of household head       \nMale  40.5  17.8  11.9 \nFemale  35.1  11.0  11.9 \nAge of household head       \nAge 15\u201330  15.6  2.4  16.6 \nAge 31\u201360  39.2  13.2  11.6 \nEducation of household       \nhead \n< Primary  31.4  8.1  19.4 \nPrimary  34.7  8.5  12.6 \nLower-secondary  46.9  11.9  12.1 \nUpper-secondary  42.1  19.7  4.7 \nPost-secondary  71.3  22.7  3.8 \nRural/Urban       \nRural  35.8  10.9  15.0 \nUrban  45.2  17.0  3.3 \nEthnicity of household       \nhead \nKinh and Hoa  48.7  13.4  9.3 \nEthnic minorities  18.7  5.0  35.7 \nTotal  36.5  12.6  11.9 \n% Moving Down from the  Absolute Change in per  Relative Change  \n20% Top in 2010 to a  Capita Income 2010\u20132014  in per Capita Income \nLower Quintile in 2014  (Fields and Ok Index)  2010\u20132014 \n \nSex of household head       \nMale  43.0  5,652.4  61.9 \nFemale  36.6  4,257.6  47.8 \nAge of household head       \nAge 15\u201330  53.0  3,440.5  45.5 \nAge 31\u201360  37.5  4,683.6  51.7 \nEducation of household       \nhead \n< Primary  48.2  3,355.8  55.6 \nPrimary  58.4  4,489.3  60.4 \nLower-secondary  38.2  4,314.8  50.2 \nUpper-secondary  31.8  5,544.7  54.1 \nPost-secondary  30.9  6,348.2  43.3 \nRural/Urban       \nRural  44.7  4,198.6  54.5 \nUrban  32.0  5,656.3  46.0 \nEthnicity of household       \nhead \nKinh and Hoa  37.9  4,964.0  51.2 \nEthnic minorities  47.8  2,479.9  52.7 \nTotal  38.4  4,597.0  51.3 \nSource: Estimates from the Viet Nam Household Living Standard Surveys 2004 and 2008. \n   \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 722  Lam and Cuong \n \nTable 2: Regression of Income Mobility of Households during 2010\u20132014 \nMoving Up from the 20%  Moving Up from the 40%  Moving Down from the \nBottom in 2010 to a  Bottom in 2010 to a  40% Top in 2010 to a \nExplanatory Variables  Higher Quintile in 2014  Higher Quintile in 2014  Lower Quintile in 2014 \nGender of household head  0.0744  \u20130.0818**  0.0102 \n(male = 1, female = 0)  (0.0712)  (0.0323)  (0.0242) \nAge of household head  0.0027  0.0005  \u20130.0003 \n(0.0024)  (0.0011)  (0.0011) \n Ethnicity of head   \u20130.1904***  \u20130.0452  0.2439*** \n(Kinh, Hoa = 0;

Clearly, more dependents create more burdens for households \nto increase their income. Agricultural land is not important for income mobility. Having \nmore land might restrict households to agricultural production, and they are less likely \nto move.  \nThere are no large differences in income mobility between urban and rural households. \nRegarding  the regional  variables,  households in  the  Southeast\u2014the  richest region \nin Viet  Nam  have  the  highest  income  mobility  than  households  in  other  regions. \nCompared with households in the Red River Delta (the reference group), households in \nthe Northeast, South Central Coast, and Central Highlands are less likely to move up \nfrom the lowest quintile. Households in the Southeast are more likely to move up from \nthe 40% bottom. Regarding downward mobility, households in the North Central Coast \nand Central Highlands are more likely to move down from the high-income quintiles.  \n4.  INTRAGENERATIONAL EMPLOYMENT MOBILITY \n4.1  Employment Structure \nIn this section, we examine the intragenerational mobility of individuals in terms of \nemployment. Table 3 shows the share of individuals aged 15\u201360 by occupation during \n2004\u20132014. The definition of employment is similar to Brand-Weiner et al. (2015). The \ncategories are unskilled manual, skilled manual (e.g., craft and related trades workers, \nmachine  operators),  and  nonmanual  (e.g.,  service  and  sales  workers, technicians, \nmanagers).  The  nonmanual  occupation  is  considered  highly  skilled.  The  share  of \nunskilled workers decreased remarkably over time. The proportion of individuals aged \n15\u201360 with unskilled employment was 72.3% in 2004 and 45.9% in 2014.  \nWe  also  analyze  employment  status  mobility,  which  defines  workers  by  wage \nemployment and self-employment. It shows that the share of self-employed workers \ndecreased from 66.5% in 2004 to 57.8% in 2014. The share of wage workers increased \nover time, indicating the expansion of the formal sector. \nEmployment  is  classified  by  sectors  including  agriculture,  industry,  and  services. \nLaborers in the agriculture sector tend to have lower skills and income than laborers  \nin  the  other  two  sectors.  During  2004\u20132014,  the  number  of  agricultural  laborers \ndecreased, and they moved to the service and industry sectors. However, in the recent \nyears from 2010 to 2014, the share of agricultural workers did not decrease. It might be \nbecause of the economic slowdown in recent years in Viet Nam.  \nTable 3: Employment of Individuals Aged 15\u201360 over Time \nOccupation  Employment  Sector \nUnskilled  Skilled  Self- Wage \nYear  Manual  Manual  Nonmanual  employed  Earner  Agriculture  Industry  Service \n2004  72.3  15.2  12.5  66.5  33.5  52.7  19.8  27.6 \n2008  64.6  20.1  15.3  63.5  36.5  49.4  22.1  28.6 \n2010  48.1  26.8  25.1  60.5  39.5  42.9  25.5  31.6 \n2014  45.9  28.7  25.3  57.8  42.2  44.5  24.3  31.2 \nSource: Estimates from the Viet Nam Household Living Standard Surveys 2004, 2008, 2010, and 2014. \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 722  Lam and Cuong \n \nTable 4 presents the employment structure of workers by different characteristics in \n2014. Men are more likely to have skilled, wage, and nonfarm jobs than women. There \nis no difference in occupation by skills between young and older people. Young people \nare more likely to have wage jobs in the industrial section than older people. There is a \nstrong correlation between education and employment. People with high education, \nespecially post-secondary school have a substantially higher proportion of skilled and \nnonmanual occupation, wage, and nonfarm jobs than those with low education.  \nThere is also a large gap in skilled occupation between urban and rural people, and \nbetween the Kinh/Hoa and ethnic minority people.

The  movement  between  \nself-employed workers and wage workers and movement between farm and nonfarm \nsectors were quite low.  \nTable 5: Employment Mobility of Individuals during 2010\u20132014 \n  Moving Up from Unskilled  Moving Down from Skilled  Moving from Self-\nto Skilled and Nonmanual  and Nonmanual to Unskilled  employed to Wage Jobs \nSex       \nMale  25.20  17.01  21.06 \nFemale  22.11  22.97  12.71 \nAge       \nAge 15\u201330  23.18  15.08  30.64 \nAge 31\u201360  23.72  21.15  12.97 \nEducation       \nLess primary  17.08  34.24  14.28 \nPrimary  23.04  29.90  17.11 \nLower secondary  25.03  24.28  17.84 \nUpper secondary  35.22  16.33  14.99 \nPost secondary  41.18  5.45  12.82 \nRural/urban       \nRural  21.34  25.95  17.63 \nUrban  40.82  9.74  10.51 \nEthnicity       \nKinh and Hoa  29.38  18.75  15.20 \nEthnic minorities  10.84  37.12  19.92 \nTotal  23.58  19.69  16.23 \ncontinued on next page \n12 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 722  Lam and Cuong \n \nTable 5 continued \n  Moving from Wage  Moving from Agricultural  Moving from Nonagricultural \nJobs to Self-employed  to Nonagricultural  to Agricultural \nSex       \nMale  19.30  14.65  15.73 \nFemale  22.32  14.35  17.53 \nAge       \nAge 15\u201330  13.54  16.85  13.28 \nAge 31\u201360  23.86  13.82  17.80 \nEducation       \nLess primary  24.43  9.03  32.52 \nPrimary  28.89  12.38  20.71 \nLower secondary  24.41  19.83  22.97 \nUpper secondary  18.58  22.44  8.51 \nPost secondary  9.75  16.26  4.61 \nRural/urban       \nRural  23.94  13.89  24.55 \nUrban  12.94  21.72  4.76 \nEthnicity       \nKinh and Hoa  18.77  17.25  13.21 \nEthnic minorities  31.10  8.09  57.29 \nTotal  20.43  14.49  16.55 \nSource: Estimates from the Viet Nam Household Living Standard Surveys 2010 and 2014. \nThere are only small differences in employment mobility between men and women. \nRegarding age, young people had higher movement from self-employed to employed \nemployment, and lower movement from employed to self-employed employment than \nolder people. Having a high education helps people find a skilled or nonmanual job and \nreduce the downward change from a skilled to an unskilled job. Rural people and \nethnic minority people are less likely to move up but more likely to move down in \nemployment than urban and Kinh/Hoa people.  \n4.3  Regression of Employment Mobility \nTable 6 presents the regressions of mobility of occupation during 2010\u20132014. The \ndependent  variables  include  the  change  in  occupation,  employment  status,  and \nworking sectors. The analysis for 2004\u20132008 is presented in Table A.4 in the Appendix. \nIt shows that men are less likely to move down from skilled and nonmanual occupation \nto unskilled occupation than women. They are more likely to move from self-employed \nto employed (wage) work than women.  \nAge is not correlated with the occupation movement. However, there is a negative \nrelationship between age and the probability of moving from self-employed to wage \njobs.  As  age  increases,  the  probability  to  move  from  self-employed  to  wage  jobs \ndecreases at a decreasing rate. \nEducation  plays  an  important  role  in  labor  mobility  from  unskilled  to  skilled \nemployment.  Compared  with  people  with  no  education,  having  a  post-secondary \ndegree increases the probability of moving up from unskilled to skilled or nonmanual \noccupation by 0.19. It also reduces the probability of moving down from skilled and \nmanual occupation to unskilled occupation by 0.23.  \n \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 722  Lam and Cuong \n \nTable 6: Regression of Employment Mobility of Individuals during 2010\u20132014 \nDependent Variables \nMoving Up from Unskilled  Moving Down from Skilled  Moving from Self-\nExplanatory Variables  to Skilled and Nonmanual  and Nonmanual to Unskilled  employed to Wage Jobs \nMale = 1, female = 0  0.0214  \u20130.0625***  0.0842*** \n  (0.0227)  (0.0192)  (0.0198) \nAge  \u20130.0021  \u20130.0086  \u20130.0183*** \n  (0.0066)  (0.0086)  (0.0064) \nAge squared  0.0000  0.0001  0.0001* \n  (0.0001)  (0.0001)  (0.0001) \nEthnic minorities   \u20130.0624  0.1356**  0.0386 \n(yes = 1;

The \nregression  results  show  that  education  is  not  correlated  with  the  movement  from  \nself-employed  to  employed  work  as  well  as  the  movement  from  agricultural  to \nnonagricultural  work.  However,  higher  education  reduces  the  movement  from \nemployed to self-employed work and from nonagricultural to agricultural work.  \nOverall,  household  composition  such  as  household  size  and  age  structure  is  not \ncorrelated with employment mobility of household members. However, having more \nagricultural land increases the movement from employed to self-employed work and \nthe movement from nonagricultural to agricultural work.

Urban people tend to move up from unskilled to skilled and \nnonmanual occupation than rural people. Compared with workers in the Red River \nDelta (the reference group), workers in the North Central Coast, South Central Coast, \nand Southeast are more likely to move up from unskilled to skilled and nonmanual. \nWorkers in the northern mountains including the Northeast and Northwest are less \nlikely to move from self-employed to wage jobs as well as move from agricultural to \nnonagricultural employment.

INTERGENERATIONAL MOBILITY \n5.1  Intergenerational Employment Mobility  \nIn this section, we analyze the intergenerational mobility of employment\u2014that is, a \ncorrelation  between  parents\u2019  employment  and  children\u2019s  employment.  We  use  the \nsample of children and parents who are still working, and children aged from 15 to 60. \nWe define parent as the one with higher wages\u2014that is, if the mother has higher \nwages than the father, the mother is defined as the parent and vice versa.  \nFigure  6  shows  that,  in  2004,  among  children  who  had  a  parent  with  unskilled \noccupation, 19% were able to find skilled or nonmanual jobs. In other words, 81% of \nchildren  had  unskilled  occupations  like  their  parents.  Occupation  mobility  greatly \nimproved in 2014: 38% of children with unskilled parents found skilled or nonmanual \noccupation.  One  reason  for  this  upward  mobility  is  the  increase  in  skilled  and \nnonmanual employment during 2004\u20132014.  \nThe improvement in occupation mobility is higher for females and older people than \nmales  and  young  people.  Education  plays  an  important  role  for  improvement  in \nintergenerational mobility of occupational skills. With post-secondary degree holders, \n80% of people whose parents are unskilled have skilled or nonmanual occupation. \nUrban and Kinh/Hoa people are more likely to have skilled and nonmanual occupation \nthan rural and ethnic minorities. \nTable 7 presents the intergenerational mobility of employment in 2014 by different \ntypes of employment and different characteristics of individuals. This table presents not \nonly upward but also downward intergenerational mobility of employment.

To correct for this life-cycle problem, in which income \nvaries  across  age,  we  control  age  of  children  in  regression.

It means that girls tend to have higher income \nmobility than boys. \nIn Figure 8, we estimate the intergenerational elasticity of children\u2019s wages with respect \nto the parent with higher wages. The intergenerational elasticity is 0.36, which implies \nthat if the parents\u2019 wage increases by 1%, their children\u2019s wage increases by 0.36%. \nThe  higher  value  of  the  intergenerational  elasticity  means  low  intergenerational \nmobility. This value is similar to several countries, such as Germany and Japan, but \nlower  than  France,  the  United  Kingdom,  and  the  US,  and  higher  than  Canada, \nAustralia,  and  the  Nordic  countries  (according  to  the  estimates  in  Corak  2013a). \nViet Nam also has a lower intergenerational elasticity than several countries such as \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (0.62 according to Gong et al. 2012), Brazil (0.58 \naccording to Ferreira and Veloso 2006), and Malaysia (0.54 according to Grawe 2004).  \nFigure 7: Intergenerational Elasticity between Father, Mother and Son,  \nand Daughter \n \nSource: Estimates from the Viet Nam Household Living Standard Surveys 2004, 2008, \n2010, and 2014. \nFigure 8 shows that the intergenerational mobility was slightly higher in 2014 than in \n2004. The intergenerational mobility is higher for urban and Kinh/Hoa people than for \nrural and ethnic minority people. \nFigure  9  shows  a  higher  intergenerational  mobility  for  women  than  men.  The \nintergenerational elasticity is very similar between young and older people. Figure 9 \nshows the important role of education in improving the intergenerational mobility.

Education  plays  an  important  role  in  intergenerational  employment.  Better \neducation  increases  the  upward  intergenerational  mobility  and  reduces  the  \ndownward  intergenerational  mobility,  especially  having  post-secondary  degrees \nimproves  the  intergenerational  employment  substantially  than  having  other  lower \neducational degrees.  \nUrban and regional variables also contribute to intergenerational mobility. Compared \nwith  rural  people,  urban  people  are more  likely  to  have  skilled  occupations  when  \nhaving unskilled parents. They are also more likely to transition from agricultural to \nnonagricultural employment. Compared with people in Red River Delta (the reference \ngroup), people in other regions such as in the Northwest, Northeast, Central Coast, \nCentral Highlands, and Mekong River Delta have a higher probability of downward \nintergenerational mobility and a lower probability.  \n6.  CONCLUSIONS \nIn  this  study,  we  examine  intragenerational  and  intergenerational  mobility  of \nemployment and income in Viet Nam in 2004\u20132008 and in 2010\u20132014. We find rather \nhigh mobility across income quintiles: 45% of households in the bottom quintile in 2004 \nmoved to a higher income quintile in 2008. However, the income mobility decreased \nover time; and 37% of households in the bottom quintile in 2010 were able to move to a \nhigher income quintile in 2014.  \nCompared with the Kinh and Hoa, ethnic minorities are more likely to move down but \nless likely to move up across income quintiles. Households with higher education \nheads are more likely to move up and less likely to move down. They are also more \nmobile than households with lower education heads. Households with more children \nand more elderly people tend to have lower income mobility. They are less likely to \nmove up to a higher quintile, but more likely to move down to a lower income quintile. \nAgricultural land is not important for income mobility. Having more lands might restrict \nhouseholds to agricultural production, and they are less likely to move.  \nThere was high mobility by occupational skills but less mobility by employment status \nand  sectors.  Among  the  unskilled  workers  in  2004,  17%  of  them  became  skilled \nmanual or nonmanual workers in 2008. The upward mobility of occupation increased \nduring 2010\u20132014. Of the unskilled workers in 2010, 24% had a skilled manual or \nnonmanual job in 2014. Men are less likely to move down from skilled and nonmanual \noccupation to unskilled occupation than women. They are more likely to move from \nself-employed to wage work than women. Education plays an important role in labor \nmobility from unskilled to skilled employment. Compared with people with no education, \nhaving a post-secondary degree increases the probability of moving up from unskilled \nto skilled or nonmanual occupation by 0.19. It also reduces the probability of moving \ndown from skilled and manual occupation to unskilled occupation by 0.23. Having more \nagricultural land increases the movement from employed to self-employed works and \nthe movement from nonagricultural to agricultural works.  \nThe intergenerational elasticity of earnings for parents and children is estimated at \naround 0.36. The intergenerational elasticity is very similar for 2004 and 2014. The \nintergenerational mobility is higher for urban and the Kinh/Hoa than for rural and ethnic \nminority  people.  The  analysis  shows  the  important  role  of  education  in  improving \nintergenerational mobility. The intergenerational elasticity for children without education \ndegrees and those with post-secondary degrees is 0.51 and 0.17, respectively.  \n24 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 722  Lam and Cuong \n \nIntergenerational mobility of occupation has improved in Viet Nam. In 2004, among \nchildren who had a parent with unskilled occupation, 19% of them were able to find \nskilled or nonmanual jobs. In other words, 81% of children had unskilled occupations \nlike their parents. Occupation mobility greatly improved in 2014: 38% of children with \nunskilled parents found skilled or nonmanual occupation. One reason for this upward \nmobility  is  the  increase  in  skilled  and  nonmanual  employment  during  2004\u20132014. \nEducation  plays  an  important  role  in  improving  intergenerational  mobility  of \noccupational skills. With a post-secondary degree, 80% of people whose parents are \nunskilled have skilled or nonmanual occupation. The urban and Kinh/Hoa people are \nmore likely to have skilled and nonmanual occupation than rural and ethnic minorities. \n \n   \n25 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 722  Lam and Cuong \n \nREFERENCES \nBaulch, B. and D.

We find high mobility across income quintiles, with more mobility of individuals by occupational skills, but less mobility by employment status and sectors. The upward mobility of occupation increased over time because of the increase in skilled occupations. The intergenerational elasticity of earnings for parents and children is estimated at 0.36. The intergenerational elasticity is similar for 2004 and 2014. Education plays an important role in improving intergenerational mobility. The intergenerational elasticity for children without a postsecondary degree is 0.51 and for those with a degree it is 0.17. For those with a postsecondary degree, 80% of people whose parents are unskilled have a skilled or nonmanual occupation.", "Title": "Intragenerational and Intergenerational Mobility in Viet Nam"}}
