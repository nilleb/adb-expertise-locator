The paper\nuses a gravity model augmented with several sets of dummy variables to estimate\nthe effect of various PTAs on trade flows within and across membership groupings\nas well as the effect of PTAs on members\u2019 trade with Asian countries. On the\nbasis of these estimates, we are able to categorize 11 major PTAs into those that\nincrease intrabloc trade at the expense of their respective imports from the rest\nof the world; those that expand their respective trade among their members\nwithout reducing their trade with nonmembers; and those that reduce trade\nwith nonmembers without significant changes in intrabloc trade. The authors\nalso show that PTAs have augmented trade in Asia.\n\n37\n\n\f I. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe past few years have seen a sharp upturn in interest and activity in the formation of\n\npreferential trading arrangements (PTAs) in the Asian and Pacific region. Japan and\nSingapore recently signed an Economic Partnership Agreement in February 2002. Singapore\nalso signed a bilateral trade agreement with New Zealand in 2001. Japanese policymakers have\nproposed a Japan-ASEAN Comprehensive Economic Partnership, and an ASEAN-People\u2019s Republic\nof China Free Trade Area was proposed by the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and endorsed\nby ASEAN\u2019s ten leaders in the organization\u2019s ministerial meeting in Brunei in October 2001. In\nFebruary 2002, government representatives of 14 Pacific Island nations met and agreed to form\na PTA. These recent events follow more than a decade of increasing numbers of PTAs in the Asian\nand Pacific region and a similar upsurge in the number of PTAs in the world as a whole in the\nlate 1980s and early 1990s. At present, about 97 percent of total global trade involves countries\nthat are members of at least one PTA. This compares with a 72 percent share in 1990.\n\nThe increased interest in preferential trade agreements raises the important question of\nwhether these more limited, often regionally based, trading arrangements are beneficial to Asian\neconomies. As PTAs become a more commonly considered policy option, it is increasingly important\nto evaluate how the economic effects of PTAs compare to the effects of broader multilateral trading\narrangements as well as how the PTAs affect world trade flows in general.\n\nThis paper focuses on the latter question. The following section describes the debate over\nPTAs\u2019 effects on world trade flows and provides some background on the PTAs we include in the\nanalysis. Sections III and IV present empirical and analytical explorations of trade flows within\nand across PTAs. We first present a set of descriptive measures of trade flows and Section V presents\nthe result of an augmented gravity model that estimates the effect that PTAs have on trade flows\nafter controlling for nonpolicy determinants of trade. Following Soloaga and Winters (2001), we\nuse a combination of dummy variables in the gravity model that allows us to separately identify\nthe effects of PTAs on intrabloc trade as well as trade between members and the rest of the world.\nOur estimating equation also includes a set of dummy variables to identify the impact that PTAs\nhave had on trade with Asian countries in particular. Another contribution is to estimate the model\nusing data covering the years 1980 to 2000, a panel that allows us to consider how the Asian financial\ncrisis influenced trade flows and the effects of PTAs on trade flows.\n\nOur main finding is that the effect of PTAs on trade flows varies widely across PTAs. We\nestimated large positive \u201cintra-bloc trade\u201d effects for the Andean Pact, Economic Cooperation\nOrganization (ECO), European Free Trade Association (EFTA), Mercosur, South Asian Preferential\nTrade  Arrangement  (SAPTA),  and South  Pacific  Regional  Trade  and  Economic  Cooperation\n\n1\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 30\nASIAN REGIONALISM AND ITS EFFECTS ON TRADE IN THE 1980S AND 1990S\n\nAgreement (SPARTECA). These trade agreements appear to have had little effect on members\u2019\ntrade with countries outside the PTAs. Membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum\n(APEC) and the European Union, in contrast, was estimated to significantly expand trade both\nbetween members of the PTA and between members and to the rest of the world. Our gravity\nmodel estimates indicate that CER had no incremental trade effect within or outside the bloc,\nand most of the estimation coefficients for this PTA were not statistically different from zero. Finally,\nwe estimated the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA)\nto have little effect in altering intrabloc trade but they have reduced exports and imports between\nmembers and the rest of the world.\n\nAcronym\n\nFull Name of PTA\n\nMember Countries\n\nAFTA\n\nASEAN Free Trade Area\n\nAndean Pact\n\nAndean Community\n\nASEAN\n\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations\n\nCER\n\nECO\n\nCloser Economic Relations Trade Agreement\n\nAustralia and New Zealand\n\nEconomic Cooperation Organization\n\nBrunei, Darussalam, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,\nPhilippines, Singapore, Thailand, and\nViet Nam\n\nBolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru,\nVenezuela\n\nBrunei, Darussalam, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,\nPhilippines, Singapore, Thailand, and\nViet Nam\n\nAfghanistan, Azerbaijan, Iran,\nKazakhstan, Kyrgyz, Republic,\nPakistan, Tajikistan, Turkey,\nTurkmenistan, and Uzbekistan\n\nIceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and\nSwitzerland\n\nAustria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland,\nFrance, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,\nNetherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden,\nUnited Kingdom\n\nArgentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and\nUruguay\n\nBangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives,\nNepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka\n\nAustralia, New Zealand, Cook Islands,\nFiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands,\nMicronesia, Nauru, Niue, Papua, New\nGuinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga,\nTuvalu, Vanuatu, and Western Samoa\n\nEFTA\n\nEuropean Free Trade Association\n\nEU\n\nEuropean Union\n\nMercosur\n\nSouthern Common Market\n\nNAFTA\n\nSAPTA\n\nSouth Asian Preferential Trade\nArrangement\n\nSPARTECA\n\nSouth Pacific Regional Trade and\nEconomic Cooperation Agreement\n\n2\n\nNorth American Free Trade Agreement\n\nCanada, Mexico, and United States\n\n\fSection II\nPTAs: Trade-creating or Trade-diverting?\n\nII. PTAs: TRADE-CREATING OR TRADE-DIVERTING?\n\nIt is an open question whether PTAs create more trade than they divert. The lowering\nof trade barriers among block members may expose member economies to greater competitive\npressures and open up larger markets for producers in member countries. Like other forms of\ntrade liberalization, PTAs can increase competition in domestic industries, which can then spur\nproductive efficiency gains among domestic producers and improve the quality/quantity of inputs\nand goods available in the economy (Dollar 1992, Sach and Warner 1995, Edwards 1998, and\nWacziarg 2001). Producers can also benefit from the greater market size created through the PTA,\nwhich can expand opportunities for exporting products and lead to enterprise and employment\ngrowth. PTAs\u2019 small size can also ease trade-facilitating \u201cdeep integration\u201d such as harmonizing\nstandards or regulatory codes.\n\nThe main fear, however, is that PTAs may augment intrabloc trade by diverting trade away\nfrom nonmember economies (de Melo, Panagariya, and Rodrick 1992; Bhagwati and Panagariya\n1996, and Schiff 1997). These policy-diverted trade flows may lead to nonoptimal patterns of\nspecialization if the distribution of resources across members is not representative of the distribution\nof resources in the world. A country that is the relatively capital-rich member of a PTA might\nbe relatively labor-rich in relation to the rest of the world, for example. PTA-induced specialization\nwould not be optimal under global free trade (Panagariya 1994, Venables 2000). Complex and\noverlapping international and regional trading arrangements can create a spaghetti bowl of complex\noverlapping regulations and commitments that are difficult to disentangle and make it difficult\nto proceed in broader trade liberalization (Bhagwati et al. 1996, Krueger 1997, Wonnacott 1997).\nIn general, the greater the difference in the comparative advantages of member economies\nto a PTA and the closer the agreement approaches open trade across members, the greater the\neconomic benefits of the agreement. However, in a world where trade interventions and market\nimperfections are commonplace, the effects of PTAs on trade flows are generally ambiguous\nanalytically. This makes empirical examination of the effects of PTAs on trade flows essential\nto understanding these effects.\n\nA.\n\nOverview of PTAs in Asia and the Rest of the World\n\nBefore reviewing the gravity model, it is useful to provide some description of PTAs in\nthe Asian and Pacific region and to contrast these with PTAs in other regions. We also look at\ntrends in trade during the years over which data used in the gravity model estimates are drawn.\nThere have been 30 multilateral PTAs and 58 bilateral arrangements notified to the World\nTrade Organization (WTO) worldwide over the past three decades. It is widely recognized that\nthe actual number of new PTAs is larger, as only PTAs involving WTO member countries are\nobligated to report to the WTO. Most of these PTAs are between neighboring countries, and most\nfall short of being free trade agreements (FTAs) although they aspire to evolve to this form of\nPTA rather than to become customs unions (CU).\n\n3\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 30\nASIAN REGIONALISM AND ITS EFFECTS ON TRADE IN THE 1980S AND 1990S\n\nThe degree of internal free trade varies greatly across PTAs, as does the breadth of the\nagreements beyond tariff reductions in terms of the sectors and goods covered and the extent of\ntariff reduction achieved. Agriculture is commonly excluded from the list of sectors where trade\nis liberalized. Most PTAs explicitly recognize the need for trade facilitation, harmonization of quality\nand other regulatory issues, infrastructure development, and streamlining customs procedures,\nbut the extent of tangible activity in these areas tends to be limited for all but a few PTAs.\nLiberalization of trade in services is comparatively rare, although liberalization of within-bloc\ninvestment policies is more common.\n\nAs noted in Frankel and Wei (1998), formal regional trading arrangements are less common\nin Asia than in other regions. Also, PTAs in the Asian and Pacific region tend to have modest\u2014\nat best\u2014achievements in liberalizing trade between members. PTAs in Asia have generally made\nfew tangible achievements in lowering tariffs and tariff reductions cover only a fraction of the\ngoods traded between members. ASEAN, for example, likely the region\u2019s PTA that has expressed\nthe clearest intention of becoming a true free trade area, achieved only modest liberalization until\nrecent years. While formal national-level trading agreements generally attract the most attention,\nit is also important to note the substantial effort to facilitate trade via subregional economic zones\n(SREZs) and infrastructure policies. The theme chapter of the Asian Development Outlook 2002\nprovides more background on these arrangements (ADB 2002).\n\nThe PTAs in the Asian and Pacific region tend to be fairly outward-looking and a large\npercentage of members\u2019 trade goes to nonmember countries. The trade flows considered in the\nnext section of the paper generally illustrate this openness. This reflects the region\u2019s strong ties\nto European, some Latin American, and United States markets. Of all the PTAs reviewed, AFTA\nand APEC members have the strongest links to the international economy. This is reflected in\nthe ratio of exports to gross domestic product (GDP). CER, SAPTA, and SPARTECA, on the other\nhand, have relatively low ratios of exports to GDP.\n\nThe  PTAs  also  vary  widely  in  the  degree  to  which  they  institutionalize  the  rules  of\ninteraction between members. The majority of Asian PTAs are built on the premise of reciprocal\ntrade concessions and thus require some sort of forum for negotiations. However, the frequency\nof negotiations varies from several times per year to once every few years. Dispute settlement\nmechanisms frequently specify some sort of bilateral negotiation, and only a few agreements set\nup a multinational court to arbitrate disagreements between members and oversee implementation\nof agreements. Many of the agreements are more ambitious in aspiration than in implementation.\nThis informality contrasts with PTAs in other regions that establish stricter rules and more formal\ninstitutional arrangements for advancing trade liberalization and for resolving disputes between\nmembers (see Asian Development Outlook 2002, in particular Table 3.5 on pages 168 and 169).1\n\n1 Publication can be viewed online at http://www.adb.org/documents/books/ado/2002/pref_trade.pdf.\n\n4\n\n\fSection II\nPTAs: Trade-creating or Trade-diverting?\n\nPTAs involving the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) developing member countries (DMCs)\nare a varied group. AFTA and SAPTA trade agreements were outgrowths of regional cooperation\nbodies  (the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation or SAARC and ASEAN, respectively).\nThese bodies were formed for largely political reasons and encompass a wider range of cross-national\ninteraction in cultural, health, environmental, and other areas as well as trade. AFTA has been\nvery active in drawing up a timetable whereby tariffs would be reduced in progressive steps, with\nthe intention of eventually evolving to a Free Trade Area. It also has an active Secretariat that\naddresses a number of issues of interest to members.\n\nThe Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) and SPARTECA are PTAs involving Pacific Island\neconomies (the latter in association with Australia). Trade volume among member countries remains\nlow and these economies remain oriented toward the larger Australian and New Zealand markets.\nThe ECO is a trade bloc that the Central Asian countries participated in after the fall of\nthe Soviet Union disrupted existing patterns of trade among themselves and Russia. It is a much\nweaker arrangement than most PTAs. The focus is on providing broader institutions that facilitate\nbilateral agreements, more than cementing a PTA in itself. The few formal diplomatic arrangements\nfor trade agreements have been offset by unilateral policy barriers and unpredictable changes\nsuch as Uzbekistan\u2019s imposition of exchange controls in October 1996, after a decline in cotton\nprices triggered a balance of payments crisis, and Russia\u2019s imposition of special tariffs after its\ncrisis in 1998 (Pomfret 2001).\n\nThe Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations (CER) Agreement, an industrial\ncountry PTA of the region, is one of the most advanced free trade areas in terms of implementation:\nthe agreement has eliminated nearly all policy barriers to trade in both goods and services. The\nagreement not only eliminates tariffs, but also contains provisions for customs harmonization and\ncommon product standards.\n\nAPEC, the largest trading arrangement that ADB member countries are involved in, has\nfew institutional structures as part of its overall philosophy of loose cooperation and \u201copen\u201d\nagreements. APEC\u2019s aspirations to create \u201copen regionalism,\u201d while sometimes criticized as being\nunrealistic, offer a unique policy orientation for a trading arrangement. While the exact nature\nof APEC\u2019s trade liberalization agenda has been unclear, some credit APEC\u2019s efforts with contributing\nto the formation of FTAs among some of its member countries.\n\nBilateral PTAs have also been common among DMCs, especially among India and its\nneighbors, and the central Asian member countries. India gives duty free access to products from\nBhutan, Nepal, and concessionary customs duties to products from Bangladesh. The list of central\nAsian bilateral agreements is quite long. Bilateral agreements between Georgia and Azerbaijan,\nKazakhstan, and Turkmenistan that were negotiated in the second half of the 1990s after the\ngoal of economic cooperation across the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) did not\nmaterialize. The individual agreements borrow from the CIS institutions\u2014rules of origin, for\nexample, are based on CIS guidelines. The Kyrgyz Republic was also highly involved in bilateral\nagreements and has reported bilateral PTAs with Armenia, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Russia, Ukraine,\nUzbekistan, and Tajikistan. Other bilateral arrangements in the Asian and Pacific region include\n\n5\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 30\nASIAN REGIONALISM AND ITS EFFECTS ON TRADE IN THE 1980S AND 1990S\n\nPTAs between Laos and Thailand, New Zealand and Singapore, as well as the above-mentioned\nAustralia-New Zealand CER.\n\nWithin the Asian region there is no common pattern in the extent of overlapping PTA\nmembership. Aside from common membership in APEC, most of the other common membership\ninvolves bilateral agreements. SPARTECA and SAPTA members have relatively few commitments\nto other PTAs, most likely because these two agreements involve least developed countries. APEC,\nAFTA, and ECO have a higher number of other commitments because of the extent of bilateral\nagreements among member countries and AFTA country membership in APEC.\n\nThe  region\u2019s  PTAs  vary  with  respect  to  the  average  level  of  income  and  economic\ndevelopment of their constituent economies (see ADO 2002, Tables 3.6 and 3.7 on pages 171 and\n172), a factor that is likely to affect the degree to which they promote intrabloc trade. Some PTAs\nhave members whose levels of economic development are fairly uniform with average per capita\nincomes falling in a narrow range, while others have members that are highly heterogeneous\neconomically. We would expect higher intrabloc trade among the latter, all other things equal.\nSAPTA and ECO have the lowest average per capita incomes (less than $1000) and also the smallest\nvariation in income per capita. Other PTAs in the region have higher average per capita incomes\nand there is substantial variation in the level of income among members. AFTA and SPARTECA\nhave the highest variation in GDP within the member countries. AFTA brings high-tech industrial\nSingapore together with the primarily rural economies of Cambodia, Viet Nam, and Myanmar.\nSPARTECA\u2019s high coefficient of variation is due to the dispersion between the Pacific Islands and\nthe New Zealand and Australian economies.\n\nIII. TRENDS AND GEOGRAPHICAL CONCENTRATION OF TRADE\nIN THE ASIAN AND PACIFIC REGION\n\nA.\n\nTrends in Trade\n\nWorld trade has grown substantially over the past half-century, particularly in the 1990s.\nThe growth rates of the volume of world merchandise exports and world GDP have diverged since\nthe 1950, indicating that the degree of trade has increased more rapidly than overall production\n(based on international trade data; see ADO 2002, Figure 3.1 on page 162 for a graphic presentation\nof these trends). The average annual growth of exports was 6.54 percent, which was higher than\nthe corresponding expansion rate of GDP of 3.84 percent between 1950 and 2000. The tradable\ncomponent of world GDP increased at the average annual rate of about 3.2 percent during the\n1950s and 1960s, its growth significantly slowed down (to 1.5 percent or less) in the 1970s and\n1980s. In the 1990s, the world\u2019s trade to GDP ratio reached its highest rate during the period\nunder consideration surpassing levels of the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1990s, merchandise exports\ngrew by 7.8 percent, or 4.7 percentage points higher than world GDP growth over the same period.\n\n6\n\n\fSection III\nTrends and Geographical Concentration of Trade in the Asian and Pacific Region\n\nExports of manufactured products have grown faster than those of agricultural and mining\nproducts (see ADO 2002, Table 3.2 on page 163 for figures). Manufacturing goods\u2019 share in total\nmerchandise exports has increased, while the respective shares of mining and agriculture sector\noutputs have declined through the years. In 2000, the share of manufactured exports in total exports\nwas estimated at 74.9 percent, up from about 70 percent in 1990. For agriculture, the share of\ntotal exports number was 9.02 in 2000, down from 12.23 percent in 1990, while mining fell from\n12.23 to 9.02 percent over the same period.\n\nObserved shifts in the types of manufactured exports suggest that these changes in trade\nflow are, at least in part, driven by policy changes. Exports of telecommunications and office\nequipment, items subject to low duties and taxes, doubled from 8.81 percent in 1990 to 15.19 percent\nof total merchandise trade in 2000. The exports of garments and textiles, a category of goods that\nis more heavily regulated in international trade agreements, such as goods covered by the Multi-\nFibre Arrangement, grew more slowly than less regulated goods in the 1990s. Textiles, in particular,\ngrew at a rate lower than that of total merchandise exports. While garment exports continued\nto be an above average performer, the increase in their share was less than one percent. The\nrespective shares of textile and garment exports were 2.55 and 3.22 percent in 2000 compared\nto 3.08 and 3.19 percent in 1990.\n\nB.\n\nGeographical Patterns of Trade\n\n1.\n\nMeasures of Geographical Concentration of Trade\n\nA simple measure to describe geographical concentration of trade is the share of a region\u2019s\ntrade to total world trade. We use exports as a summary statistic for country trade. The resulting\nstatistic is\n\nwhere Sr,W is the share of region r to total world trade; XT\nworld trade; and XT\n\nW,W  is all world exports.\n\nr,W is exports from region r to the world\n\nAnother measure, called the intraregional or intrabloc trade share highlights the importance\n\nsr,W = xT\n\nr,W / xT\n\nW,W\n\nof intraregional trade:\n\nsr,r = xT\n\nr,r / xT\n\nr,W\n\nThe intraregional trade index is useful for comparing regional trade flows over time in a\nPTA with constant membership, as it automatically increases with r and thus can be misleading\nwhen comparing PTAs of differing sizes.\n\nThis problem may be overcome using the simple trade concentration ratio or trade intensity\n\nratio (Frankel 1997, Petri 1993):\n\n7\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 30\nASIAN REGIONALISM AND ITS EFFECTS ON TRADE IN THE 1980S AND 1990S\n\nIr,r = xT\n       xT\n\nr,r / xT\nW,r / xT\n\nr,W\n\nW,W\n\nIf this index is one, bloc members are trading with each other in the same intensity as\n\nthey would have traded with nonmembers.\n\nC.\n\nRegional Trade Shares\n\nThe shares of total world trade originating from various regions and economies have changed\nmarkedly over the last half-century.2 North America, Western Europe, and Japan have consistently\nbeen the top three trading regions or countries. Together they account for 64.3 percent of world\nexports and 68.6 percent of imports. These figures are substantively higher than they were in\n1948, at 59.2 and 61.2 percent, respectively. Recently, the share of the PRC in total world trade\nhas been rising while that of Japan declined in 2000, having its peak in 1993. Like the PRC, the\nshare of the group comprising Central and Eastern Europe, Baltic States, and CIS states has\nexpanded in the 1990s.\n\nAsia\u2019s share to total world trade of merchandise exports doubled over the past 50 years,\nwhile its share of world imports increased by only 60 percent. Eight countries account for 84 percent\nof Asia\u2019s export share in 2000 and 82 percent of its import share. These include PRC, Japan, and\nsix East Asian trading countries. About half a century ago, the corresponding figures representing\nthe contribution of these countries to Asia\u2019s share in world trade were respectively 32 and 36 percent.\n\nD.\n\nIntrabloc Export Shares\n\nA useful measure for comparison across time is the share of trade among members of a\ngiven group of trading countries or region to total trade of the region. Higher intrabloc trade shares\nmay indicate a possible preference of members of a region or bloc to trade with each other. Figure\n1 shows the intrabloc shares of exports for eleven trade blocs while Table 1 lays out the five-year\naverages  of  these  shares.3  The  blocs  include  AFTA,  Andean,  APEC,  CER,  ECO,  EFTA,  EU,\nMercosur, NAFTA, SAPTA, and SPARTECA. The period covered in the table is from 1980 to 2000.\nRegional export shares exhibit a moderately rising trend toward the end of the 1990s. This\npattern is most noticeable in the case of NAFTA, APEC, and ASEAN. Moderate growth of the\nrespective intraregional export shares of the PTAs covered in this analysis may more likely be\nattributed to changes in the composition of these groupings, rather than to any intensification\nof preference of PTA members to trade among each other.

Chile, Mexico, and Papua New Guinea joined APEC in\n1993, while Peru, Russia, and Viet Nam became members in 1998. As for ASEAN, Cambodia, Laos,\nMyanmar, and Viet Nam joined the organization between 1995 and 1998.\n\nThere have been instances where intrabloc trade shares fell (e.g., ECO, Andean Pact, and\nMercosur between 1998 and 2000) as a result of external shocks and institutional changes happening\nwithin these PTAs. Political instability and economic restructuring in Central Asia combined with\nthe lack of integration of ECO countries in the world economy explain the fall in the ECO trade\nshare. External shocks associated with the Asian financial crisis likely contributed to a decline\nin Asian PTAs in the late 1990s.\n\nTable 1 shows Asian PTAs (with the exception of APEC, which has many Asian countries\nas members but whose membership extends to North and South American countries as well) tend\nto have the larger share of their respective trade with nonmembers\u2014particularly in comparison\nto  EU  and  NAFTA.  This  observation  may  possibly  be  explained  by  the  nature  of  the  PTAs\nthemselves, as promoting intrabloc trade among its members. That is, NAFTA or EU members\ncomprise a natural bloc and the preferential policies have aggravated this natural attraction among\nmembers to trade with one another. This explanation can hardly be applied, however, to the case\nof APEC, to which we return shortly when we take up the apparent limitation of intrabloc trade\nshares for measuring the impact of PTAs.\n\n9\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 30\nASIAN REGIONALISM AND ITS EFFECTS ON TRADE IN THE 1980S AND 1990S\n\nTable 1.

Their smaller\nper capita GDPs\u2014in turn the outcome of their particular development status, economic shocks,\nor political instability\u2014are such that their trade will tend to flow toward more wealthy countries\neven if their respective members share common borders. The Latin American PTAs\u2014the Andean\nPact and Mercosur\u2014trade predominantly with countries outside of the PTA, which reflects the\nimportance of the EU or US as a trading partner in that region.\n\nIt warrants note that the high intrabloc shares for APEC, EU, and NAFTA do not necessarily\nindicate that the respective members of these prefer trade with other bloc members over trade\nwith nonmembers. The index tends to be higher PTAs that include more or larger trading economies.\nFrankel (1997) cites the case of EU (previously the European Economic Community [EEC]) when\nthe PTA expanded from six members in the 1960s to 12 in the 1990s, resulting in an increase of\nEEC\u2019s intraregional trade share from 49 percent in 1962 to 60 percent in 1990. The small intrabloc\ntrade share of EFTA (i.e., 12 percent) may likewise be explained by the fact that this PTA has\nlost its members to EU.\n\nE.\n\nTrade Intensity Indices\n\nThe  weakness  of  intraregional  trade  shares  as  measures  of  trade  orientation  can  be\naddressed by using simple concentration ratios or trade intensity indicators. The trade concentration\nratio is obtained by dividing the intraregional trade share by the share of the region to total world\ntrade. When the trade intensity indicator is equal to one, the PTA does not have any trade-diverting\neffect. That is, PTA members are trading among themselves at the same intensity as they would\nwith nonmembers. If there is extra trade that goes on in the region beyond the normal pattern\nin the absence of the PTAs, then the trade intensity exceeds one.\n\n10\n\n\fx\ne\nd\nn\nI\n\ny\nt\ni\ns\nn\ne\nt\nn\nI\n\ne\nd\na\nr\nT\n\n18\n\n16\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nSection III\nTrends and Geographical Concentration of Trade in the Asian and Pacific Region\n\nThe estimated trade intensity indices for the 11 PTAs from 1980 to 2000 are shown in\nFigure 2.

The smaller ones tend to have bigger ratios, with size of PTAs defined\nas the PTA\u2019s share of world trade. There are differences between our estimates and Frankel\u2019s\ndue to the difference in membership in the periods that the two studies focus on.

The Asian PTAs have lower corresponding\nestimates, no more than ten. The ECO bloc countries, comprising mostly Central Asian economies,\napparently traded relatively more among themselves in the first half of the 1990s. Based on the\ndata for the second half of that decade, this appears no longer true. This observation may indicate\nthat these countries have adopted a more outward trade orientation in that period. A similar\nobservation may be said of AFTA, but unlike in ECO the intensity index for the Southeast Asian\nbloc consistently fell in the 1990s. SAPTA countries formed their PTA in the middle of the 1990s.\nAs shown in the figure, the trade intensity index for SAPTA rose to 1997 but fell subsequently.\n\n4 See Table 2.3 of Frankel (1997).\n\n11\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 30\nASIAN REGIONALISM AND ITS EFFECTS ON TRADE IN THE 1980S AND 1990S\n\nWe computed the five-year averages of the intensity indices since 1980 in order to describe\nmore clearly the pattern of trade concentration disclosed by the ratios (see  Table 2). APEC and\nEU have consistently the two lowest trade intensities among the 11 PTAs examined. NAFTA and\nEFTA switched in the bottom third or fourth places, with NAFTA increasing its index in the 1990s.\nThe other PTAs in Asia exhibit through time an increasing outward orientation. It is interesting\nto note that CER and SPARTECA appear to focus their trade within their bloc compared with\nAFTA, ECO, or SAPTA in the 1990s.\n\nTable 2.

This indicates a surge of intrabloc trade activity among its members.\nEarlier and using intraregional trade share indices, we documented how Mercosur and Andean\nintrabloc exports had increased dramatically from 1995 to 1998 but had fallen from 1999 to 2000.\nWhat is interesting to note here is that by deflating the intraregional shares with the respective\nregional share of total world trade, we observe that Mercosur and Andean remained as having\nthe highest intrabloc trade intensity. This has to indicate that the respective trade shares of these\nregions in world trade had obviously declined by a rate much greater than the decrease of intrabloc\ntrade. Obviously, this highlights the effect of keeping track of general economic performance in\nassessing intraregional trade activity, and leads us to the analysis of trade flows using gravity\nmodels of trade.\n\n12\n\n\fSection IV\nAnalyzing Trade Effects of PTAs Using a Gravity Model\n\nIV. ANALYZING TRADE EFFECTS OF PTAs USING A GRAVITY MODEL\n\nA.\n\nBasic Determinants\n\nIn this section, we outline the gravity model of bilateral trade flows used in analyzing the\neffects of PTAs.5 In the model, trade between two countries is viewed as being positively affected\nby the economic mass of trading partners and negatively affected by the distance between the\ntrading partners. Additional variables, such as physical area, population, indicators of cultural\naffinity, and sharing contiguous borders are usually added to empirical gravity models to elaborate\non the \u201ceconomic mass\u201d and distance variables.\n\nUnder the model, the total merchandise exported by country i to country j (Xij) is defined\n\nas follows:\n\nXij  =  AYi\n\n\u03b2iYj\n\n\u03b2jHi\n\n\u00b5iHj\n\n\u00b5jNi\n\n\u03b3iNj\n\n\u03b3jDij\n\n\u03b1Dj\n\n\u03b4\u03b5\n\nij\n\nwhere Yi\nHi\nNi\nDij\nDi\n\nrepresents the gross domestic product of country i;\nrepresents the geographic size of country i;\nrepresents the population of country i;\nrepresents the distance between country i and country j;\nrepresents the average distance between country i and its export markets\nin other countries;\nis a constant;\nis an error term; and\n\nA\n\u03b5\nij\n\u03b2,\u00b5 > 0; and \u03b3, \u03b1, \u03b4 < 0.\n\nTaking the logarithm of (1), we get:\n\u00b5\ni log Yi + \u03b2\ni log Hi + \nj log Yj + \n+ \u03b1 log Dij + \u03b4 log Di + log \u03b5\n\nlog Xij = log A + \u03b2\n\nij\n\nThe regression equation typically used:\n\n\u00b5\nj log Hj \n\n+ \u03b3\n\ni log Ni + \n\n\u03b3\nj log Nj\n\nlog Xij = log A + \u03b2\n\n+ \u03b3\nj log Yj + \n+ \u03b1 log Dij + \u03b4 log Di + \u03b1 ADJij + cIi + dIj + log \u03b5\n\ni log Yi + \u03b2\n\n\u00b5\ni log Hi + \n\n\u00b5\nj log Hj \n\nij\n\ni log Ni + \n\n\u03b3\nj log Nj\n\nincludes several dummy variables ADJij, Ii, and Ij to capture additional features of the country\npair such as whether the trading partners have adjacent borders (ADJ) or either partner is an\nisland economy (I). The error term is the standard Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) residual.\n\n5 Those responsible in developing the theory of the gravity model include Deardorf (1984); Helpman and Krugman\n(1985); and Helpman (1987). Frankel (1997, 61) cites Helpman and Krugman as the originators of the standard\ngravity model. The name used for their analytical framework is taken after Newton\u2019s theory of gravitation\nbecause of the analogy.\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n13\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 30\nASIAN REGIONALISM AND ITS EFFECTS ON TRADE IN THE 1980S AND 1990S\n\nPer capita GDP is considered a key variable in the model, and larger economies are expected\nto engage in greater trade. However, a number of other factors act against the \u201cgravity like\u201d forces\nof economy size. Country geographic size and population are factors expected to reduce trade\norientation by increasing the size of the domestic market and making economic activity more\ninwardly oriented. For example, the PRC and Japan both have large economies of roughly similar\nsize, but trade little. This may be explained by the fact that the PRC has a lower per capita GDP,\nwhich weakens its capacity to attract trade from Japan. The PRC\u2019s large population gives Chinese\nproducers plenty of consumers domestically and tends to dampen rather than augment exports.\nFrankel (1997) explains that countries with large populations tend to be more inwardly oriented\nthan smaller countries because they are better able to exploit scale economies in their large domestic\nmarkets. This may explain why bilateral trade flows generally have an inverse relationship to\npopulation size. Like population, physical area is expected to reduce trade flows to the extent\nthat countries with relatively small or limited natural resource endowments tend to be smaller\nand thus depend more on trade to obtain natural resources not available in the country.\n\nKrugman  (1991a)  considers  the  distance  between  two  countries  to  be  an  important\ndeterminant of geographical patterns of trade. Trade is attractive to the extent of the gains from\ntrading less the transaction cost incurred in realizing such gains. Distance tends to increase the\ncost of transacting international exchange of goods and services. Beyond some distance, costs of\nconsummating a cross-border exchange become prohibitive and accordingly no trade occurs. The\nfarther apart two potential trading partners are, the more costly their bilateral trade, which erodes\npossible gains from trade. Linnemann (1966) categorizes the costs of international trade transactions\ninto three types: (i) shipping cost, including freight and insurance; (ii) cost of time; and (iii) \u201cpsychic\ndistance\u201d or \u201ccultural cost.\u201d  Distance is not the only determinant for shipping cost. In examining\ndata on freight, insurance, and shipping charges, Frankel (1997) notes that shipping costs vary\nwidely across countries in Central Africa, where two remote trading partners may have relatively\nlow aggregate shipping cost because only commodities that have relatively low shipping cost are\ntraded.  Accordingly,  commodity  composition  of  trade  is  needed  in  order  to  understand  the\nrelationship between distance and shipping cost.\n\nEvidence suggests the effect of distance on trade flow has changed through time. Estimates\nfrom a gravity model carried out by Boisso and Ferrantino (1997) using data covering the years\n1965-1985 suggest that distance had a deterrent effect on trade until the middle of the 1970s,\nbut that this effect has declined since then. They claim that the average distance between trading\npartners increased in the postwar period, indicating that shipping costs have fallen steadily. Trading\npartners located far apart from each other will have to require more time in transporting goods\nbetween each other, which discourages trade. This cost includes the intrinsic value of the goods\nthat is foregone if these are not delivered on time. The \u201cpsychic distance\u201d or \u201ccultural cost\u201d refers\nto the lack of familiarity by the citizens of a country about their trading partners (Drysdale and\nGarnaut 1982). Cultural or linguistic affinity, shared borders, and whether the trading partner\u2019s\nterritories are islands are factors that would tend to reduce cultural distance. Countries sharing\na common language or having citizens belonging to the same ethnic group are more likely to transact\nbusiness with each other.\n\n14\n\n\fSection IV\nAnalyzing Trade Effects of PTAs Using a Gravity Model\n\nIn the specification of the basic gravity model used in this paper, following Soloaga and\nWinters (2001) we include two variables in our basic gravity model to capture different aspects\nof the influence of distance on trade flows. First, we include a variable measuring the distance\nbetween the capital cities for each pair of trading countries (Dij). Second, we include a measure\nof the remoteness of a country captured by the average distance between the country and the\ncountry with which it trades (Di). In examining the effect of PTAs on the direction and volume\nof trade, it is important estimates controlled for the effect of distance and these other factors on\ntrade flows. Next, we incorporate the variables representing PTAs, along with the other variables\noutlined as important in determining trade flows, into a gravity model.\n\nB.\n\nPreferential Trade Agreements in the Gravity Model\n\nIn adopting the basic gravity model framework to study the effect of PTA membership\non trade flows, Aitken (1973) and Braga, Safadi, and Yeats (1994) introduce a variable that takes\nthe value of one if the two trading countries are both members of the PTA, and zero otherwise\ninto the model. They interpreted the estimated coefficient of this dummy variable to be the sum\nof the trade-creation and trade-diversion effects of the PTAs. A positive coefficient for the variable\nindicates that the PTA tends to generate more trade to its members. One shortcoming of this initial\napproach is that a single variable cannot separate the effects of the PTA on trade creation and\ntrade diversion, so the approach does not inform judgment regarding the relative magnitude of\nthe creation and diversion effects.\n\nBayoumi and Eichengreen (1995) and Frankel (1997) add a second variable to enable trade-\ncreating and trade-diverting effects of PTAs to be separated in the estimates. The variable takes\nthe value of one if the importing country is a member of the PTA and the exporting country is\na nonmember; zero if otherwise. The coefficient of the \u201cextra-bloc\u201d variable represents the trade\nof nonmembers diverted to the members of the PTA. A positive value suggests PTA members reduce\nimports to the bloc from nonmembers.\n\nSoloaga and Winters (2001) introduce two additional PTA-related variables in order to\ncapture the effects of PTAs on trade in general. One variable purportedly captures the impact\nof nondiscriminatory import liberalization enacted through the PTA, and takes a value of one if\nthe importer is a member of a bloc and zero otherwise. This variable is different from the extra-\nbloc PTA variable of Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1995) and Frankel (1997), because that variable\ncaptures only the extra imports of members from nonmembers. Soloaga and Winters\u2019 specification\nconsiders the extra imports of members of the PTA from all trading partners regardless of their\nmembership status. A final dummy variable introduced by Soloaga and Winters seeks to capture\nthe extra exports of PTA members to all their trading partners, and takes a value of one if the\nexporter is a member and zero otherwise.\n\nEquation (4) represents the decomposition of the trade effects of PTAs that Soloaga and\n\nWinters introduce:\n\n15\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 30\nASIAN REGIONALISM AND ITS EFFECTS ON TRADE IN THE 1980S AND 1990S\n\nlog Xij = log A + \u03b2\n\ni log Yi + \u03b2\n\n\u03b3\n\u00b5\nj log Nj\ni log Ni + \ni log Hi + \n+ \u03b1 log Dij + \u03b4 log Di + a ADJij + cIi + dIj + bkPkiPkj + mkPkj\n+ nkPki + log \u03b5\n\n\u00b5\nj log Hj \n\nj log Yj + \n\n+ \u03b3\n\nij\n\n(4)\n\nwhere Pki is a dummy variable that takes the value of one if exporting country i belongs to PTA\nk and zero otherwise; and Pkj is a similarly defined dummy variable for importing country j belonging\nto PTA k. The coefficient bk on the interaction of Pkj and Pki  represents the additional exports\nfrom i to j that occur when both countries are members of the PTA k. The coefficient on  Pkj , mk,\nrepresents the additional exports from country i, not a member of PTA k, to a country j in PTA\nk. In other words, this dummy represents the additional imports that country j in PTA k receives\nfrom the world outside the PTA. The coefficient nk has a similar interpretation as country i\u2019s exports\nto nonmembers of the PTA.\n\nSoloaga and Winters\u2019 elaboration of the earlier models adapted to examine the trade effects\nof PTAs can be understood as seeking to measure the impact of PTAs on the trade of their respective\nmembers, and not just on intrabloc trade as in the traditional approach of Aitken (1973) and Braga,\nSafadi, and Yeats (1994). The trade liberalization effects of PTAs are highlighted. The trade of\nmembers of the OTA is measured through the sum of the coefficients of the intrabloc variable\nand the extra-import and extra-export variables. The total effect of the PTA on trade with bloc\nmembers is thus: bk + mk + nk, or the sum of trade diversion (bk) and general trade liberalization\neffects on exports (nk) and imports (mk). The separate dummy variables allow for us to assess the\nrelative contribution of the PTA to narrow intrabloc trade as well as general trade with the world.\nIn the most extreme trade-diverting case, the coefficient bk would be positive (indicating increased\nexports from when both countries are members of PTA k), and mk + nk is negative (indicating\nthat being in PTA k depresses a country\u2019s imports from the rest of the world more than it increases\nits exports to the rest of the world, or vice versa, so that the net effect on trade flows between\nPTA members and the world is negative). In a case where the PTA expanded intrabloc trade but\ntrade with the rest of the world increased as well, we might also have a positive intrabloc effect\nas well as positive import and export effects.\n\nC.\n\nModeling the Effect of PTAs on Asian Trade\n\nBecause the focus of the present study pertains to the effect of PTAs on Asian trade, we\nintroduce Asian variables into the gravity model in order to capture the effect of PTAs on Asia\u2019s\ntrade. Following Soloaga and Winters, we separate the extra imports and the extra exports that\nAsia gets because of a PTA. The \u201cAsia extra import\u201d effect of a PTA is denoted by the estimation\ncoefficient in equation (5) of the interaction between the ASIA dummy variable j that takes the\nvalue of one if importer j is in Asia, and the dummy variable Pki that is one if the exporting country\nA, measures the extra imports that Asian\ni is a member of PTA k. The estimation coefficient, mk\ncountries obtain from PTA k, regardless of whether they are members of PTA k or not. The \u201cAsian\nA measures the added exports Asian countries provide\nextra export\u201d effect is defined similarly. nk\n\n16\n\n\fSection IV\nAnalyzing Trade Effects of PTAs Using a Gravity Model\n\nto member countries of PTA k. It is the estimation coefficient of the interaction between the dummy\nvariable denoting membership of importer j to PTA k and the Asian status variable of exporter\ni. The estimation equation is thus:\ni log Yi + \u03b2\nlog Xij = log A + \u03b2\n\n\u00b5\nj log Hj \n\ni log Ni + \n\n+ \u03b3\n\n\u00b5\ni log Hi + \n+ \u03b1 log Dij + \u03b4 log Di + a ADJij + cIi + dIj + bkPkiPkj + \u03a3 k\nAPkiASIAj + nk\n+ mkPkj + nkPki + mk\n\nAPkj ASIAi + log \u03b5\n\nj log Yj + \n\nij\n\n\u03b3\nj log Nj\nk=1 bkPkiPkj\n\n       (5)\n\nAs noted above, Soloaga and Winters separate the effects of a PTA into two:  first, the\neffect on trade diversion/augmentation (excess trade within the bloc relative to that predicted\nby gravity model factors) and second, general liberalization effects (excess imports and exports\nthat members have to all countries whether they are members or not), alongside the non-PTA\ntrade determinants included in the gravity model.\n\nThus for each trade bloc k, Soloaga and Winters identify the extent to which bloc k is trade-\ndiverting, bk, as against promoting its members\u2019 overall trade in general, (mk+nk). The total effect\nof the PTA k on its members\u2019 trade is (bk+mk+nk) or the sum of trade diversion and overall trade\neffects. This applies to PTAs that include Asian and non-Asian members. Under our specification,\nthe effect of PTA k on members\u2019 trade with Asian members (above and beyond its trade with\nA. This comprises: (i) the effect on Asian imports\nmembers in general) is given by: mk+nk+mk\nA); and (ii) the\nfrom bloc k, regardless of whether Asian importers belong to PTA k or not (mk+mk\neffect on Asia\u2019s exports to bloc k, regardless of whether the Asian exporters are members of PTA\nk or not (nk+nk\n\nA+nk\n\nA).\n\nD.\n\nData and Estimation Issues\n\nThe data used in estimating the gravity model comes from the International Monetary\nFund\u2019s (2001) Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS). Eighty-three countries are included in the\nanalysis, and bilateral exports for every pair of these countries are extracted from the DOTS\ndatabase for the years 1980 to 2000.5 The number of observations varies per year, and because\nthe model was estimated in logarithms, instances of zero trade between two countries were dropped\nfrom the datasets used in estimations.6 Dropping these cases from our estimation implies that\nour results should be interpreted as capturing the effect of PTAs on trade flows among trading\ncountries, conditional upon the decision to trade having been made. It seems reasonable to assume\nthat the source of truncation\u2014the decision to not export at all to a particular country\u2014is at best\nonly slightly correlated with memberships in PTAs and geographic variables so that bias in the\ncoefficients is minimal. This is clearly a second-best solution that affects the efficiency of the OLS\nestimates, but the alternative of explicitly modeling the decision to trade would, we feel, involve\n\n5 These 83 countries accounted for roughly 73 to 85 percent of total global exports during the period 1980 to\n\n2000.\n\n6 Across the 83 countries included in our dataset, instances of no trade between pairs of countries accounted\n\nfor between 16 and 20 percent of the total country pairs.\n\n17\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 30\nASIAN REGIONALISM AND ITS EFFECTS ON TRADE IN THE 1980S AND 1990S\n\nimposing too many assumptions on what are essentially highly idiosyncratic economic and political\ndecisions.\n\nExport values are expressed in real terms, being deflated using a merchandise price index\n(base year 1990) obtained from the WTO International Trade Statistics 2001, then transformed\ninto logarithms for the estimations. Estimates are carried on using both single-year cross sectional\ndata and panel data constructed from five-year intervals (1980, 1985, 1990, 1995 and 2000) of\nthe available data. Population and GDP data was obtained from the World Bank\u2019s (2001) World\nDevelopment Indicators. The distance between capital cities was obtained from John Haveman\u2019s\n(2002) International Trade Data website, while the data on land area was obtained from the World\nFactbook of the US Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nV. EMPIRICAL RESULTS\n\nIn Tables 3 through 8, we report our gravity model estimation results. The model was\nestimated two ways. Estimates were carried out using cross sectional data sets for selected single\nyears of data (i.e., 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995, and 2000). Second, longitudinal estimates were carried\nout using a panel of data constructed from 1985, 1995, and 2000 data. We discuss these results\nnext, starting with Table 3, which summarizes the estimation coefficients for the basic variables\nof the gravity model. Tables 4 and 5 summarize the estimated effects of each of the 11 PTAs whose\neffects on trade flows were assessed. Across the six model estimates, between 68 and 73 percent\nof the variation of trade flows was explained by the variables included in the gravity model, including\nthe variables capturing the effects of PTA membership.\n\nA.\n\nBasic Determinants of Trade Flows\n\nAs reported in Table 3, GDP, the distance between capitals, country land area, and sharing\na common border are statistically significant at the 95 percent confidence level and better still\nhave the expected sign. Distance between two countries is shown to be the most important basic\nfactor in determining trade flows. The one exception where the sign of the basic coefficients was\ncontrary to expectations involves the estimated coefficient for the log of population in panel data\nestimates, for which the estimation coefficient is positive and statistically significant. This is contrary\nto the usual finding that larger countries tend to trade less. The effect of country remoteness on\nits trade was most often negative and significant, as one would expect, but in the cross sectional\nestimates for 1980 the variable was estimated to have a positive and significant effect.\n\nTurning our attention to the estimated effects of PTA membership, results should be\nconsidered in three distinct areas. First, estimates allow examination of the effect of PTAs on\nthe trade flows between PTA members. Second, results should be considered in terms of the effect\nof PTAs based in Asia and elsewhere on Asia\u2019s trade. Lastly, estimation results can be considered\nin terms of what they suggest regarding the effects of PTAs on total world trade.\n\n18\n\n\fSection V\nEmpirical Results\n\nTable 3.

Based on our estimation results, we categorize PTAs into three groups\nbased on whether they tend to foster intrabloc trade, foster greater trade with trading partners\nworldwide, or are estimated to have reduced intrabloc trade. In the next section, we discuss\nestimation results for particular PTAs, grouping PTAs according to their apparent trade-diverting\nor trade-augmenting effects.\n\nB.\n\nPTAs Fostering Intrabloc Trade\n\nAs  summarized  in  Table  4,  the  Andean  Pact,  ECO,  EFTA,  Mercosur,  SAPTA,  and\nSPARTECA are PTAs showing large positive \u201cintra-bloc trade\u201d effects. Each of these had positive\nand statistically significant coefficients for intrabloc trade, only small changes in their overall\nimports, and increases in their exports to the world over the period covered in the data.7 This\nsuggests membership in these PTAs led constituent economies to divert trade toward the economies\nof other members at the expense of trade with the rest of the world. We will discuss the estimates\nfor each of these PTAs separately, and compare our findings to those of earlier research.\n\n7 To put these numbers in perspective, SPARTECA with a factor of 13.6 has a base of only about $120 million,\nimplying that the incremental exports that the PTA is responsible for is equal to about $1.6 billion at 1990\nprices.\n\n19\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 30\nASIAN REGIONALISM AND ITS EFFECTS ON TRADE IN THE 1980S AND 1990S\n\nTable 4.

The magnitude of the\nintrabloc trade diversion effect obtained in this study is about a third lower than the corresponding\nestimates of Soloaga and Winters (2001). The estimates also show membership in the Andean\nPact was generally associated with significantly lower total import levels although the effects on\noverall exports were, in most instances, did not allow rejection of the null hypothesis that the\nPTA had no effect. Our results contrast with those of Frankel (1997), who found that the intrabloc\ntrade variable for the Andean Pact usually had statistically significant negative coefficients.\n\nThe estimates for the intrabloc trade variable for Mercosur are all statistically significant\nand positive, while estimated coefficients for the overall import variable are not significant although\nmost are positive. These results are consistent with those obtained by Soloaga and Winters (2001)\nand Frankel (1997). Results imply that the increased intrabloc trade within Mercosur has not\neliminated Mercosur\u2019s imports from the world. Estimates show Mercosur membership is associated\nwith positive and statistically significant effects on total exports, which differs from the results\nobtained by Soloaga and Winters (2001).\n\nThe estimate of the intrabloc trade effects of Mercosur membership for the most recent\nyear for which data is available suggests the tendency toward intrabloc trade orientation among\nbloc members is growing stronger, not weaker as suggested by Preusse (2001). In this paper, Preuse\nargues there have been two phases in Mercosur\u2019s implementation. In the first phase, intra-Mercosur\nexports expanded by 28.4 percent, which the author attributes to the increasing significance of\nregional production. Intra-Mercosur investments have accompanied the integration process of the\nregion, and have contributed to greater regional production. The strong trade-diverting effects\nof the first phase were followed by the aborted formation of a full-fledged customs union in 1995\nin the wake of the Asian crisis and economic recession of the region, which Preuse argues has\nreduced intrabloc trading bias in the PTA.\n\nYeats\u2019 (1998) research suggests an explanation for the results obtained in the present study.\nIn assessing Mercosur\u2019s trade performance in the first half of the 1990s, Yeats noted that intrabloc\ntrade increased substantially at the expense of trade with nonmember countries. This stemmed\nfrom the group\u2019s \u201cdiscriminatory tariffs against nonmembers, which are four to six times higher\u201d\nthan those of the EU or NAFTA. It was further noted that the intraregional trade and export\ngrowth among members was concentrated in products that were not competitive outside of the\nregion. Extending the analysis to 2000, our finding that Mercosur positively and significantly\ninfluenced the intrabloc trade share may well reflect the impact of accumulated inefficiencies induced\nby relatively high discriminatory protection maintained earlier.\n\n8 Except for estimates carried out using data from the second half of the 1990s, EFTA\u2019s intrabloc trade effect\n\nwas not accompanied by a significant increase in overall exports of EFTA to the world.\n\n22\n\n\fSection V\nEmpirical Results\n\nThe coefficients of the intrabloc trade are statistically significant and positive across all\nour estimates for SAPTA. These findings differ from that of Frankel and Wei (1998) who found\nSAPTA membership was associated with lower levels of trade between members than would\nnormally be expected. The results reported in Table 4 indicate that SAPTA members traded at\nnearly twice the level they would be expected to trade given the sizes of their economies, proximities,\nand similar characteristics. This is based on the coefficient of the intrabloc trade variable obtained\nin our panel data estimate. The estimates of the impact of SAPTA membership on overall imports\nare all not significantly different from zero, while estimates of the effect of membership on total\nexports are positive and statistically significant. This result suggests there is an orientation toward\nintrabloc trade among SAPTA members. Members export at a 27 percent higher rate than the\nglobal average according to our estimates.\n\nThe results for ECO suggest membership in this PTA had a positive and statistically\nsignificant effect on intrabloc trade between members in the early 1980s. During these same years,\nmembership in ECO was associated no significant effects on overall imports and a statistically\nsignificant decline in member economies\u2019 overall exports. However, these effects dissipated over\ntime as ECO members appear to have carried out structural adjustment and opened up their\neconomies to global trade after 1985. Results in the second half of the 1980s differ markedly from\nthe earlier effects. The estimated effect of membership on intrabloc trade was not significantly\ndifferent from zero, while membership was associated with significantly higher total imports and\nexports in estimates carried out using data from 1980 and 1990. However, in 1995 and 2000\nestimates, ECO membership was once again associated with greater intrabloc trade. Membership\nin these latter years was also associated with lower total imports and higher total exports. Particular\ncaution is warranted in interpreting the gravity model results for ECO since the transition economies\nof Central Asia that make up ECO were undergoing dramatic changes in the structure of their\neconomies during the years over which the models were estimated. Basic changes in the structure\nof economies, sectoral production, and prices may have had more profound implications for trade\nflows to and from these countries than changes in tariffs or other trade policies carried out under\nthe aegis of ECO. Accordingly, one can reasonably expect that much of the change in trade flows\ncaptured in our estimates were likely due in greater part to the broader economic restructuring\nthat was under way rather than to PTA membership.\n\nA final PTA that estimates indicate fostered greater intrabloc trade was SPARTECA, which\ninvolves Australia and New Zealand and several Pacific Island countries. The regression results\nindicating a strong intrabloc effect are expected. Trade tended to flow more intensely among the\nsmaller Pacific Island economies that are members of SPARTECA and between Australia and\nNew Zealand than between the Pacific Island economies and their larger neighbors\u2014relative to\nthe latter\u2019s level of trade with the rest of the world. The potential for more trade between Pacific\nIsland economies and Australia and New Zealand is limited by the small size of the smaller\neconomies\u2019 domestic markets. The signs of the coefficients of the intrabloc dummy variable for\nSPARTECA membership are positive and statistically significant in our estimates. The estimated\ncoefficient for total imports went from being not significantly different from zero in the 1980s\n\n23\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 30\nASIAN REGIONALISM AND ITS EFFECTS ON TRADE IN THE 1980S AND 1990S\n\nto being negative and statistically significant in the 1990s. The associated expansion of intrabloc\ntrade over time appeared to occur at the expense of member economies\u2019 imports from the rest\nof the world. The estimates of the coefficients measuring the effect of membership on total exports\nwere all positive and statistically significant in our estimates.\n\nC.\n\nPTAs Fostering Greater Intrabloc Trade and Greater Trade\nwith the Rest of the World\n\nMembership in APEC and EU was estimated to significantly expand trade between members\nof the PTA as well as between members and to the rest of the world. These results are summarized\non Table 5.\n\nThe signs of the coefficients of variables capturing the effect of APEC membership on\nintrabloc trade and on total imports and exports are all positive and statistically significant. This\nsuggests that APEC is achieving its goals of open regionalism and augmenting total trade. The\nresults obtained in our estimates are consistent with those of Frankel (1997). As with Frankel\u2019s\nestimate, our estimated coefficient for the intra-APEC export dummy variable is large and positive\nand is statistically significant. The tendency for greater intrabloc trade identified in the analysis\nwas accompanied by strong tendencies toward greater trade with the rest of the world as well.\nWhile some researchers have argued that the size of the coefficient of the intrabloc variable for\nAPEC obtained in Frankel\u2018s estimate was too high (Polak 1996), Frankel attributed the strong\neffect to the large share of total world trade accounted for by APEC member economies. He also\nnoted the large coefficient estimate was not due to the inclusion of entrep\u00f4t economies, as his\nestimates excluded Singapore or Hong Kong, China from APEC\u2019s to control for the effect \u201cextra\nopen\u201d economies might have on estimates. Frankel concludes that the \u201cAPEC effect is genuine\u201d\nand quoting Garnaut (1994), he maintains that the trade-augmenting impact identified for APEC\nis consistent with the type of integration \u201cwhere the initiative has remained primarily with\nenterprises acting separately from state decisions, and where official encouragement of regional\nintegration does not include major elements of trade discrimination.\u201d\n\nAcross the years for which the gravity model was estimated, the estimated effect of EU\n(in the 1980s) was positive although not statistically significant. All the estimates of the effect\nof EU membership on total imports and total exports are positive and statistically significant.\nThese results differ from those of Soloaga and Winters (2001), which found that EU has fostered\nneither overall trade nor intrabloc trade, as would ordinarily be expected. Soloaga and Winters\noffer the explanation that deeper economic integration between member economies has reduced\nEU\u2019s imports from nonmembers. The differences in these estimation results might be explained\nby differences in the data used to estimate the gravity model across the two: our study and the\nearlier one by Soloaga and Winters. Soloaga and Winters used data on imports while our estimates\nare based on exports data.9 Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1997) observed that the strong intrabloc\neffect of EEC in the 1980s appeared to have dissipated by the early 1990s.\n\n9 It is unclear how use of exports versus imports affects results, although Havrylyshyn and Pritchett (1991) noted\nsome of their gravity model estimates changed depending upon whether they used data on imports or exports\nto estimate the model.\n\n24\n\n\fSection V\nEmpirical Results\n\nOur gravity model estimates indicate that CER had no incremental trade effect within\nor outside the bloc, and most of the estimation coefficients for this PTA were not statistically different\nfrom zero. Coefficients associated with trade flows between member countries are no higher than\nwe would expect them to be given the size of countries\u2019 economies and their proximity. The signs\nof the coefficients of the intrabloc and Asian export variables are almost all negative, except for\n2000. In the estimates carried out using data from 2000, many coefficients are statistically significant\nand suggest CER did not divert trade. The coefficients for the variables capturing the effect of\nthe PTA on total imports and exports are positive and statistically significant.\n\nFrankel\u2019s (1997) estimation results for the intrabloc trade effect for CER differ from ours.\nHe found the intrabloc trade effects of the PTA were positive and statistically significant. Frankel\nused total trade data, i.e., sum of exports and imports while we use export data, which may account\nfor the different results obtained in the two studies. Differences in the model specification (e.g.,\nexclusion of language dummy variables in our estimates and the use of several additional dummy\nvariables to gauge the effect of PTA membership on trade included in our model) may also account\nfor the different results obtained.\n\nD.\n\nPTAs that Reduced Gross Trade but did not Change\nIntrabloc Trade Significantly\n\nIn our estimates, AFTA and NAFTA were PTAs that showed no effect in altering intrabloc\ntrade but appeared to have reduced exports and imports between members and the rest of the\nworld. The estimates obtained in this study for the coefficients of the intrabloc, overall import,\nand overall export variables for ASEAN are all not statistically significant. This adds yet another\nstudy with results for AFTA that disagree with those obtained in earlier research. Frankel (1997),\nfor example, found membership in AFTA was associated with significantly more intrabloc trade\nthan would otherwise have been expected. Soloaga and Winters (2001) found AFTA had a negative\nand statistically significant effect on intrabloc trade. A possible explanation for why the results\nof this study differ from earlier research is that the data used in our estimates included new\nmembers of ASEAN, namely Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam; while the earlier\nestimates did not. As a group of countries that are less developed and less integrated into the\nglobal economy than the previous five member countries of ASEAN, their inclusion in the gravity\nmodel may have diluted the effect of ASEAN on its trade within and outside the PTA.10\n\nEstimation results related to the effect of NAFTA on intrabloc trade and on the trade of\nmember economies with the rest of the world failed to reject the null hypothesis that the PTA\nhas no effect. Earlier studies (Frankel 1997, Soloaga and Winters 2001) had earlier documented\na similar result, so consensus is building that NAFTA has not affected the trade orientation of\nits constituent economies. In our panel estimates, NAFTA membership was associated with lower\nalthough not statistically significant intrabloc trade.\n\n10 Sensitivity  analysis  suggests  that  estimate  results  are  robust  to  changes  in  the  specification  of  the  PTA\nmembership variables, but that inclusion of new ASEAN members in the dataset did significantly influence\nestimation results.\n\n25\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 30\nASIAN REGIONALISM AND ITS EFFECTS ON TRADE IN THE 1980S AND 1990S\n\nOur results suggest NAFTA members\u2019 total exports and total imports were lower than\nexpected, and that the negative effect grew stronger over time. Soloaga and Winters had obtained\na similar result, that the coefficient for overall imports of NAFTA members was negative and\nstatistically significant after 1986. This same study found the coefficients capturing the effect of\nthe PTA on total exports of members went from being positive in the early 1980s (specifically,\n1980 to 1983) to being negative in the period after 1984. The results of these two studies suggest\nthat NAFTA members may be reducing their overall trade with the rest of the world. Although\nour results are essentially the same as those obtained in earlier research, what is new about our\nresults is that we have reached this conclusion using the latest trade data.\n\nE.\n\nGross Intrabloc Effect\n\nTable 6 summarizes the effects of PTAs on the trade flows with their members and non-\nmembers. The measure used is the anti-logarithm of the sum of the coefficients of the intrabloc,\noverall import and the overall export variables of the PTA minus one. Soloaga and Winters refer\nto this sum of these logarithms as the \u201cgross intra bloc\u201d effect. This exercise involves adding up\nthe coefficients reported in Tables 3 through 5. Since not all of these coefficients are statistically\nsignificant, we accept the hypothesis that the coefficients having estimates that are not significant\nat a 95 percent confidence level or higher are equal to zero.\n\nThe estimates of the total trade effects vary markedly across the PTAs treated in our model\nestimates. APEC, ECO, and Mercosur appear to be the PTAs having the greatest impact on\nmembers\u2019 trade flows. At the other extreme, estimation results suggest AFTA and NAFTA have\nreduced the trade of their member economies. The overall effect of the 11 PTAs is an expansion\nof gross intrabloc trade by a factor of 7.8 according to our estimates. Earlier studies of the effects\n\nTable 6.

The estimated coefficients for the two dummy variables\nrepresenting Asian imports from and Asian exports to each PTA are also reported in Tables 4\nand 5. Overall, our results suggest that PTAs fall into two groups with respect to their effects\non Asian trade. In the first group, which tended to have insignificant intrabloc trade effects and\nneutral impact on member economies\u2019 trade with the world (i.e., AFTA and NAFTA), members\ngenerally had higher than expected levels of trade with Asia. The other PTAs, which displayed\nsignificant intrabloc trade effects and in some cases positive and significant effects on total trade,\nshowed either no significant effects or negative and significant effects on trade with Asia.\n\nConsidering PTAs as a whole, empirical estimates suggest trade in Asia has been augmented\nby the existence of PTAs, including both PTAs within the region as well as PTAs based in other\nregions. As summarized in Table 7, results provide little support for the assertion that PTAs have\ndiverted trade to member countries at the expense of trade outside the PTAs. The measure of\nthis trade diversion/augmentation used in Table 7 is the anti-logarithm of the sum of the estimated\ncoefficients for overall import, overall export, Asian import, and Asian export dummy variables\nin equation 4 minus one.11\n\nAccording to our gravity model estimates, the general effect of PTAs on trade in the Asian\nand Pacific region is small compared to the effect PTAs have in other regions.

The 11 PTAs treated\nin our estimations are found to be associated with a net expansion of trade within Asia and between\nAsia and other regions by a factor of 0.67 according to the gravity model estimates presented in\nthis paper. The figures reported on Table 7 reflect the sum of the PTA\u2019s effects on overall imports\nand exports, and on imports and exports between member economies and Asian and Pacific\neconomies. In some cases (e.g., NAFTA), the positive effect of the PTA on Asian trade is outweighed\nby the negative effects on overall trade. In the case of CER, negative effects of PTA membership\non overall trade flows and on trade flows between Australia and New Zealand, and on trade flows\nwith Asian and Pacific countries combine to generate a stronger negative effect. The net influence\nof PTAs based in Asia\u2019s subregions, namely those involving countries of the South Pacific and\nOceania (SPARTECA), South Asia (SAPTA), and Southeast Asia (AFTA), appears to have been\nto induce expanded trade in the greater Asian and Pacific region.\n\nThe effect of the EU on Asian trade suggested by estimates indicates a more complicated\npicture. The EU was estimated to have a strong positive effect on trade flows between member\neconomies and the rest of the world\u2014including trade to Asia. However, the specific effect of EU\non Asian trade was found to be negative and statistically significant. Overall, the total trade effect\ndominates the Asia-specific effect, making the net effect of the EU on Asian trade positive. It is\nalso worth noting that cross sectional estimation results suggest the net effect of the EU on Asian\ntrade has grown more positive over the past two decades. Although not covered in our estimates,\nthe new least developed countries initiative for EU member countries, which grants nonreciprocal\ntrade preferences toward small and least developed countries, could carry negative consequences\nfor the EU\u2019s level of trade with Asian countries excluded from the arrangement.\n\nTrade between countries in the Asian and Pacific region and Mercosur member economies\nwas estimated to have occurred at a rate higher than would be expected in the absence of the\nPTA. Lastly, estimates show the effect of ECO on Asian trade varied greatly across years of the\ncross sectional estimates, which likely reflects the widespread structural changes in the constituent\neconomies during the 1980s and 1990s, but on average had a small positive effect on trade flows\nto and from the Asian region as a whole and Central Asia.\n\nG.\n\nPTAs(cid:146) Contribution to World Trade\n\nIn Table 8, the effects of PTAs on world trade in general are summarized. The indicator\nused for this purpose is the anti-logarithm of the sum of the estimated coefficients of the intrabloc,\noverall import, overall export, Asian import and Asian export variables less one. In general the\nindicators are positive. Only CER and NAFTA appear to have reduced trade. It was discussed\nearlier that the effect of NAFTA on its members\u2019 trade with the world was significantly negative\nand this effect dominated the bloc\u2019s positive effect on Asia\u2019s trade with its members. For CER,\nthe negative effect of this PTA on its Asia\u2019s exports to its members explain why CER\u2019s effect on\nworld trade is also to reduce its members\u2019 trade with the world. Both NAFTA and CER have\n\n28\n\n\fTable 8.

On average, world trade is increased because of PTAs by\na factor of 2.4. This result of the gravity model analysis provides evidence that these PTAs create\ntrade.\n\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this study, we estimated a gravity model of bilateral trade involving 11 trading blocs\nmost of which are from the Asian and Pacific region. The trade data used in estimating the gravity\nmodel is that of 83 countries from 1980 to 2000. The estimated coefficients of the basic determinants\nof the gravity model such as GDP, distance between capitals of trading partners, population, and\nphysical area explain well cross-country trade flows.\n\nOur estimates of the effect of different PTAs on the trade flows between members vary\nremarkably across PTAs. Preferential trading agreements are categorized into three groups based\non whether they tend to foster intrabloc trade, foster greater trade with trading partners worldwide,\nor reduce trade in general without changing their respective intrabloc trade. Andean Pact, ECO,\nEFTA, Mercosur, SAPTA, and SPARTECA belong to the first group in varying intensity with respect\nto promoting intrabloc trade. These tend to expand their trade among their respective members\nat the expense of their members\u2019 imports from the world and exports as well, although in a few\ninstances these PTAs have a positive effect on their exports to the world. Interestingly, these PTAs\nhave the propensity to expand Asia\u2019s trade.\n\nAPEC, CER, and EU belong to the second group of PTAs that have expanded or have not\nchanged at all their intrabloc trade, but this was not at the expense of their trade with the world.\nAPEC and CER in particular illustrate the type of PTAs that adhere to open regionalism. EU,\nbeing in this list, is a surprise as other authors are of the view that EU is diverting trade toward\nits members.\n\nSection VI\nConclusions\n\nAverage\n\n1.16\n6.57\n4.39\n-0.50\n6.87\n0.48\n0.20\n6.09\n-0.25\n4.00\n49.83\n2.42\n\n29\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 30\nASIAN REGIONALISM AND ITS EFFECTS ON TRADE IN THE 1980S AND 1990S\n\nAFTA and NAFTA are the PTAs that have not changed their intrabloc trade but reduced\ntheir overall trade with the world. While other authors have regarded AFTA as trade-creating,\nthe result may be explained by the fact that in this analysis the bloc includes its new members.\nEarlier independent estimates had only included the original AFTA contracting parties. The new\nAFTA members are less integrated with the world economy as the founding members of this PTA.\nIn this study, we introduced two new dummy variables that allow the analyst to measure\nthe impact of PTAs on the trades of countries in the Asian and Pacific region, while retaining\nthe innovation made by Soloaga and Winters (2001) to the empirical gravity model analysis. One\nvariable is designed to capture the effects of PTAs on Asia\u2019s imports from it. The other variable\nmeasures the impact of the PTA on Asia\u2019s exports to the trade bloc. The resulting added feature\nof the gravity model makes possible the impact of PTAs on Asia\u2019s overall trade.\n\nIn summary, the PTAs in this analysis have contributed significantly to trade expansion\nboth at the global and regional (Asian and Pacific) levels. The results obtained in this study provide\nevidence that PTAs can create rather than divert trade.\n\nThese results suggest that PTAs offer a next-best path toward expanding world trade if\nnegotiations for multilateral trade liberalization take a longer time to get completed. It will be\nimportant to follow macro-level cross-country research such as this paper with more focused studies\non the dynamics of PTA members\u2019 policies toward trade with the rest of the world and participation\nin multilateral trading agreements such as the WTO. One claim that could be tested, for example,\nis whether negotiating PTAs help developing countries gain experience with trade liberalization\non a limited scale that later smoothes the way toward more general trade opening (Michalopoulos\n1999).\n\nHaving noted this potential, policymakers need to be aware that PTAs vary. There are\nPTAs that tend to divert trade toward its members, be unnecessarily costly to administer, or create\nopportunities for unproductive rent seeking activities. The challenge to policymakers is to continue\nto innovate on their respective regional trade arrangements. A few ideas include using the regional\narrangement to solve for regional spillover problems or facilitate trade and capital movements\namong members, thereby reducing the cost of doing business and increasing investments and\naggregate economic activity of its members.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAitken, N.
