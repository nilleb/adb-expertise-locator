INTRODUCTION \nFinancial inclusion, broadly defined as the access of households and firms (in particular \nlow income and SMEs) to financial services,1 has become one of the most important \nissues  in  modern  development  discourse.  While  cross-country  studies  can  offer  a \nbird\u2019s-eye  view  of  the  general  patterns  that  are  common  across  countries,  each \ndeveloping country has its unique set of problems related to the financial inclusion of \nvulnerable households and small/medium size businesses. In this respect Georgia \noffers an interesting case study.  \nGeorgia is a country of 3.7 million,2 situated in the South Caucasus, bordering the \nRussian Federation, Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Armenia. After gaining independence in \n1991, the country experienced the deepest economic collapse among the transition \neconomies,  exacerbated  by  several  wars  and  refugee  crises.  Following  the  Rose \nRevolution of 2003, the country\u2019s economy and in particular its financial system has \nalso undergone deep structural transformations, increasingly attracting foreign capital \nparticipation.3  \nThe National Bank of Georgia (NBG) managed to establish and maintain a rather \nstrong  micro  and  macro-prudential  regulatory  system,  slowly  restoring  trust  in \ncommercial  banks.4 The  structural  transformation  of  the  banking  system  implied \nconsolidation, reducing the number of players on the market.5 At the same time, the \nnumber of people serviced by the commercial banks was rising continuously as well.6 \nIn this respect, Georgia\u2019s indicators outperformed the average for Europe and Central \nAsian countries (excluding the high-income countries).  \nDespite impressive progress in financial access across several dimensions, Georgia \nremains one of the countries with the highest poverty rates in the region.7 Various \nsurveys,  including  the  quarterly  Business  Confidence  Index  run  by  ISET-PI,  also \nindicate that access to finance remains one of the biggest obstacles to doing business \nfor SMEs. Thus, the question of whether the poorest population and small businesses \nremain underserved by the financial system, and what are the obstacles to greater \nfinancial inclusion for these groups remains open. One possibility is that access to \nfinance  is  impeded  by  low  incomes  of  households  and  low  profitability  of  small \nbusinesses.  In  this  regard,  the  question  is  whether  policy-makers  have  access  to \n                                                 \n1  N. Yoshino and P.

Population  statistics,  2017  http://www.geostat.ge/ \nindex.php?action=page&p_id=152&lang=eng \n3  In 1995, just three out of 211 banks were foreign-controlled, while in 2016 the vast majority (11 out of  \n19 commercial banks) had 50% or more foreign capital participation.  \n4  While NBG tightly controlled commercial banks, the non-bank financial institutions were much less \nregulated until recently. The details of the regulatory environment will be discussed in Section 6 of  \nthe paper.  \n5  The number of banks operating in Georgia reduced from 211 in 1995 to just 19 in 2016, with the two \nlargest banks currently controlling 60% of the total assets of the banking system. \n6  For example, the number of borrowers from commercial banks per 1,000 adults grew from 32 in 2004 to \n680 in 2015, and the number of commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults rose from 9.3 to 31.9 \nduring the same period. \n7  Poverty  rates  have  been  coming  down  substantially  in  recent  years  (Ref:  World  Bank,  World \nDevelopment  indicators).  Despite  this,  the  country\u2019  poverty  headcount  ratio  at  $3.10  per  day \nsubstantially exceeds the corresponding rates for the whole region (25.27% of the population in \nGeorgia, vs. 6.24% in ECA countries) and even for the neighboring countries, such as Armenia (14.62% \nof the population in Armenia).  \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 849  Babych, Grigolia, and Keshelava \n \nmedium-term solutions to this problem, and whether greater financial literacy levels \ncould improve the situation for poorer households and small firms.  \nThis paper provides an overview of the current financial sector situation in Georgia and \ninvestigates the obstacles to financial inclusion based on an analysis of the available \nstatistical data, the most recent studies and reports on the subject, as well as the \nresults of the most recent surveys.  \n2.  OVERVIEW OF THE GEORGIAN FINANCIAL SYSTEM  \n2.1  Sources of Financial Services for Individuals and SMEs \nIn the last 27 years, the Georgian financial system has undergone substantial structural \nchanges. The level of financial access for individuals and SMEs has also changed \nquite dramatically.  \nDespite the fact that between 1996 and 2017 the number of banks in the country \ndecreased from 174 to just 16, access to banking services via bank service points \n(branches) increased more than three times (from 242 bank branches in 1996 to 826 in \n2016). The number of registered microfinance organizations increased drastically \nfrom two in 2004 to 81 in 2016. Unfortunately, until 2013 no data was gathered by NBG \non non-regulated financial lending institutions, such as pawnshops. The first survey of \npawnshops in 2013 accounted for 1,307 organizations around the country8.  \nCurrently (2016 and 2017), financial services in Georgia are provided by 16 banks,  \n11 non-bank depository corporations (e.g. credit unions), 14 insurance corporations,  \nof  which  two  are  private  pension  schemes,  81  microfinance  organizations,  1,307 \npawnshops, 9 the  stock  exchange,  six  brokerage  companies  (securities  dealers),  \n124 money remittances units, and 1,200 active foreign exchange bureaus. The overall \nsize of the financial sector in Georgia has grown quite impressively. In 2000 total \nassets of financial corporations accounted for 31.8% of GDP, in 2016 this share was \nalready 127.4% of GDP. The most rapid growth spurt occurred between 2005 and \n2007 (total financial sector assets grew 1.4 times in absolute terms, increasing from \n38.5% to 63% of GDP). Since the growth spurt, financial sector assets grew at a steady \npace of 17% per year on average.10 The total assets of microfinance organizations in \nparticular grew from 0.02% of GDP to 8.03% of GDP in just 10 years (between 2006 \nand 2016).  \nDespite the impressive growth in the microfinance sector in recent years, the financial \nsystem remains largely dominated by commercial banks. They account for 70%  \nof  the  financial  sector\u2019s  total  assets.11 Other  financial  corporations,  like  insurance \ncompanies, microfinance organizations, and pawnshops account for about 8% of total \nfinancial sector assets. Of these, 80% are controlled by microfinance organizations. \n   \n                                                 \n8  Pawnshop Survey. National Statistics Office of Georgia, 2013. http://www.geostat.ge/cms/site_images/ \n_files/english/finance/Pawnshop%20survey%20results.pdf \n9  2013 survey data.  \n10  Excluding the year of the financial crisis, 2009.  \n11  NBG, 2016 data. \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 849  Babych, Grigolia, and Keshelava \n \nFigure 1: Share of Financial Sector Assets Controlled by Different Financial \nOrganizations in Georgia  \n \nSource: NBG. \n2.2  Deposits \nThe  market  for  deposits  in  the  country  is  also  dominated  by  commercial  banks.  \nNon-bank depository institutions, such as credit unions, account for a tiny proportion \n(0.0326%)  of  the  total  deposits  in  the  economy.  The  value  of  total  deposits  in \ncommercial banks (both in domestic and foreign currency) amounted to GEL18.7 billion \n($7.75 billion) by the end of Q3 2017, the same variable for non-bank depository \ninstitutions amounted to only GEL6.1 million ($2.5 million).  \nOther financial institutions, such as microfinance organizations, are barred by law from \ntaking deposits. However, they are allowed to enter into loan agreements with private \nindividuals and firms. Such loan agreements typically offer significantly higher interest \nrates on both foreign and domestic currency than regular bank deposits.12  \nIn the last 12 years, the number of commercial bank deposit accounts per 1,000 adults \nhas been growing steadily; in 2005 there were 366 household deposit accounts per \n1,000 adults, in 2016 this figure already reached 1,798 \u2013 a five-fold increase.  \nThe indicators of access to deposit accounts have shown improvement over the \nyears, but more so for households than for SMEs.  \nAs the figures above indicate, outstanding deposits of SMEs with commercial banks, as \na share of GDP, remained flat for the last 8 years (at the level of 3.1% to 3.7% of \nGDP), while household deposits grew impressively from 6.02% to 21.28% of GDP. \nWhile it is difficult to pinpoint the exact reason for this phenomenon, the low level of \nfinancial  literacy  may  play  a  role  here.  Another  concern  is  that  remaining  in  the \n\u201cshadow\u201d of mainstream economic activity is still the preferred way of doing business \nfor SMEs.  \n \n                                                 \n12  Since July 2017, microfinance organizations can only enter into such loan agreements with customers if \nthe amount of funds loaned exceeds GEL100,000 or an equivalent in US dollars. This regulation helped \nmove large amounts of de-facto deposits from microfinances to commercial banks. For microfinances it \nmeans that they will increasingly rely on commercial bank loans for liquidity.  \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 849  Babych, Grigolia, and Keshelava \n \nFigure 2: Outstanding Deposits with Commercial Banks, % of GDP  \n(Total, Household, SMEs)  \n \nSource: IMF Financial Access Survey (FAS). \n2.3  Lending  \nCommercial banks in Georgia also dominate the market in the total amount of \nloans issued. The amount of loans granted by banks to non-government, non-financial \nsector,  and  households  is  roughly  13  times  the  amount  of  loans  granted  by  the \nmicrofinance institutions.13 Overall, microfinance organizations lent GEL1.4 billion by \nthe end of 2016 (equivalent to $0.59 billion14), while the commercial banks\u2019 total non-\nfinancial sector loans amounted to GEL18.9 billion ($8.0 billion). In absolute terms, \nbanks dominated the market in lending to households. By the end of 2016 the \nmicrofinance organizations\u2019 loan portfolio was about GEL1.4 billion (the vast majority of \nthese loans are to households and small business clients), while the commercial banks\u2019 \nhousehold lending was GEL8.9 billion ($3.76 billion).  \nIn relative terms, commercial banks\u2019 loans to households comprise just above 50% of \ntheir total loan portfolio. In contrast, the microfinance organizations\u2019 portfolio consists \nalmost entirely of household and small business lending.  \nThe  figures  on  micro  lending  presented  here  do  not  include  pawnshops.  The \npawnshops are periodically surveyed by the National Bank of Georgia,15 which allows \nus to judge the relative size of the pawnshop lending market. For example, in the 2013 \nsurvey pawnshops had in total GEL310 million ($186 million) in outstanding loans, \nwhereas the microcredit institutions in 2013 had about twice as much \u2013 GEL620 \nmillion (or $373 million).  \n   \n                                                 \n13  For example, at the end of 2016 the total loans of the commercial banking sector amounted to GEL18.9 \nbillion, while the loans of microfinances amounted to GEL1.4 billion.  \n14  GEL amounts converted to dollars at the average annual exchange rate for the corresponding year.  \n15  The pawnshop survey is scheduled to be repeated in 2017\u20132018.  \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 849  Babych, Grigolia, and Keshelava \n \nFigure 3: Household Loans as a Share of Total Loans of the Commercial Banks \n(%) \n \nSource: NBG. \nAccording to the most recent data, Georgia has the highest and fastest growing \ndomestic credit to private sector as a share of GDP in the South Caucasus. Since \n2015 the country has been ahead of both Armenia and Azerbaijan. Private credit \nexpanded to 62% of GDP in 2016, as Figure 4 below indicates. \nFigure 4: Domestic Credit to Private Sector, % of GDP  \nin the South Caucasus Countries \n \nSource: IMF International Financial Statistics (IFS). \nTo a large extent, the growth in credit reflects borrowing by households. In particular, \nhousehold debt has been rising since 2005, slowing down in 2009, and picking up \nagain from 2011(following roughly the same pattern as the expansion of household \nloans in Figure 3). Overall, the household debt to GDP ratio has risen from 2.2% in \n2001 to 30% in 2016.  \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 849  Babych, Grigolia, and Keshelava \n \n2.4  Insurance \nThe market for insurance in Georgia is still quite small. The share of assets held by \ninsurance companies is small, both relative to the size of the economy and the size of \nthe financial system. For example, both in 2016 and in 2017, the gross earned market \npremium was just 1.086% of GDP. Health insurance holds the largest market share \n(49.7% of the total gross written insurance premiums), followed by Road Transport \ninsurance (16%), and Property insurance (15.7%) \n2.5  Pensions Services \nIn Georgia, the size of the market for private pension schemes is very small. All \ncitizens above 60 years old (female) and 65 years old (male) receive a government \npension of GEL160, which currently constitutes about 17% of the average wage in  \nthe country.  \nDespite the small income replacement rate of the current government pension, private \npension schemes are not very popular, which is primarily due to the low incomes and \nlow  savings  rates  of  the  households.16 In  2017,  there  were  three  private  pension \nschemes in Georgia with 22,507 participants. By the end of Q2 2017, the combined \npension reserves of these companies were GEL 24 million, which constituted only \n0.07% of 2016 GDP.  \nCurrently  in  Georgia,  a  supplementary  (pillar  II)  Pension  Savings  System  (with \nmatching government and employer contributions) is seen as a way to improve the \nadequacy of the current pension scheme and stimulate long-term saving behavior. The \ndraft law of the system is ready and is planned to come into force from the third quarter \nof 2018. Due to the low capacity for saving from labor income and high risks associated \nwith political distortions and investments in the long run, questions regarding the risks \nand challenges related to this reform remain open.  \n2.6  Capital Markets  \nGeorgia  has  only  one  organized  security  market  \u2013  the  Georgian  Stock  Exchange \n(GSE), founded in 1999. The stated market capitalization as of 3 January 2018 was \n$1.286  billion  (around  8.5%  of  2017  GDP),  while  daily  turnover  in  January  2018 \namounted to $11,185.17  \nThe GSE operates two listed tiers (tier A and B) and an \u201cadmitted\u201d tier. Companies \nmust satisfy special requirements to be listed in A or B tiers. As of 8 January 2018, \nthere were only three companies on the A list level (EBRD, Silknet, and Bank of \nGeorgia); six securities were on the B listed level (Georgian Leasing Company, M2 \nReal  Estate,  Nikora  Trade,  Nikora,  Liberty  Bank,  and  Teliani  Valley),  while  the \n\u201cadmitted\u201d tier contains 97 securities. Only a few Georgian companies are listed on \ninternational stock exchanges. For example, as of March 2017, the equities of several \nGeorgian companies like the Bank of Georgia (BGEO),18 TBC Bank Group (TBCG LN), \n                                                 \n16  The rate of savings for old age is particularly low in Georgia. According to Financial Inclusion Indicators \nfor 2014, in Georgia only 0.9% of the adult population saved for old age, compared to 12.5% in lower \nmiddle-income countries, and 11.7% in ECA developing countries.  \n17  Source: Georgian Stock Exchange. http://www.gse.ge/en/about-gse \n18  It is worth mentioning that the Bank of Georgia (BGEO) was divided into two independent companies: \nBank of Georgia Group (commercial bank) and BGEO Investment. Both of these companies will be \nlisted on the London Stock Exchange.  \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 849  Babych, Grigolia, and Keshelava \n \nand Georgian Healthcare Group (GHG LN), were actively traded on the London Stock \nExchange.19  \nAccording to the recent literature assessing the development of the capital markets,20 \nthe Georgian equity market remains underdeveloped. There are several reasons for \nthis. First, company owners are unwilling to give up their stakes and thus seek other \nsources of finance. Second, the cost of equity still remains high. Third, equities are \nconsidered to be much riskier investment opportunities for banks, retail clients, or other \ninvestors.  \nDespite the fact that the bond market should be relatively more attractive for firms and \ninvestors, as the cost of debt is lower than the cost of equity, bonds are still not the \nmain source for attracting finance in Georgia. For instance, there were only six bond \nissuers in 2015 and this number increased only slightly, to eight in 2016. Some bonds \n(including those issued by resident legal entities in local currency) can be used by \ncommercial banks as collateral for receiving refinance loans21 from NBG.  \nThe main legislative acts that regulate activities in the capital market are the \u201cLaw of \nGeorgia on Entrepreneurs\u201d and \u201cLaw of Georgia on the Security Market.\u201d Recently \nGeorgia prepared and approved a capital market development strategy and introduced \nnew standards on: a) independent board members and audit committee; b) disclosure \nrequirements for related party transactions and management compensation, and c) \nprotection of minority investors. Furthermore, the Georgian government is planning to \nimprove corporate governance standards by making the publishing of annual reports22 \nbased  on  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS)  mandatory  for \nGeorgian companies.23  \n2.7  Remittances \nRemittances  constitute  an  important  part  of  Georgian  national  income.  Studies \nestimate  that  about  1  million  people  benefit  from  remittance  transfers  from \nabroad.24 In recent years, the amount of remittance transfers fluctuated between \n12% and 10.5% of the country\u2019s GDP.25 This number is much higher than the Eastern \nEurope and Central Asian (ECA) countries\u2019 average of 1.4%. In 2016, Georgia was in \n29th place among countries by the share of remittance transfers in GDP.26 To the extent \nthat remittances play a crucial role in alleviating poverty among the most vulnerable \nhouseholds and in supplementing the overall income and savings, their potential role in \nthe country\u2019s financial system is very significant. Yet, according to the 2007 EBRD \nsurvey data, only 1% of remittance recipients had a savings account in a bank, and \n                                                 \n19  All of these three companies are listed in a premium equity listing category.  \n20  For  example:  Asian  Development  Bank,  \u201cThe  Georgian  Capital  Market  \u2013  Diagnostic  Study  and \nRecommendations,\u201d 2015; Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development of Georgia, \u201cCapital \nMarket Development Strategy,\u201d 2016he; United States Agency for International Development (USAID), \n\u201cRegulatory Impact Assessment Georgian Law on Securities Market,\u201d 2014 by etc.  \n21  Which represents one of the main instruments for commercial banks to manage liquidity.  \n22  This new initiative will come into force step-by-step starting in 2018 for large and medium entities and \n2019 for small and micro businesses.  \n23  G.

ECA countries group refers to Europe and Central Asia (excluding high income \ncountries).  \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 849  Babych, Grigolia, and Keshelava \n \nabout 11% of recipients had no bank account at all (despite the fact that 81% of the \nrecipients had a \u201cpositive view\u201d of banks in Georgia).27 \nMost remittance transfers were sent and received via money transfer operators (25%  \nof senders and 35.6% of recipients). The shares of remittance transfers sent or \nreceived via money transfer operators is about twice as high in Georgia than in \nother lower middle-income countries or the ECA region. There are currently 106 \nregistered money remittance transfer units in Georgia, according to the NBG data.  \nIn  2014,  about  22.1%  of  adult  Georgians  received  money  from  abroad.  Of  these \nrecipients, only 10% received transfers via financial institutions, while more than a third \n(35.6% of the recipients) used a money transfer operator. This may have to do with the \nfact that a vast majority of remittances come from the Russian Federation, thus official \nfinancial ties with Georgia are much weaker (and more expensive) for political reasons.  \n2.8  Technologies Driving Financial Sector Development \nGeorgia\u2019s financial sector technologies are now in the stage of active growth. \nThe following range of financial technologies is available for the general population and \nSMEs in the country: debit and credit cards, e-money accounts, mobile banking and \nmobile money accounts, e-wallets and mobile wallets, ATMs, POS terminals, payment \nservice provider (PSP) terminals, and electronic signature services. These systems are \nused  for  making  payments,  receiving  deposits,  and  transfers  (including  remittance \ntransfers and salaries).  \nDistance banking services are among the most commonly used technologies, which \ninclude  internet  banking,  telephone-banking,  mobile-banking,  and  SMS-banking. \nToday, seven commercial banks have licenses for internet-acquiring from international \npayment  systems  and  successfully  serve  their  clients.28 According  to  recent  data  \nfrom the Global Payment Systems Survey, the number of debit cards in circulation \nincreased threefold in the last 5 years (from 2.5 million in 2010 to 7.3 million in 2015). \nAs of December 2017, there were 8.3 million debit and 0.8 million credit cards issued in \nGeorgia.  Georgians  actively  use  electronic  payments  to  pay  public  utilities  and \npurchase goods.29 \nDespite  the  significant  progress  made  in  recent  years,  according  to  the  Global \nPayments Systems Survey (2016),30 the usage of financial technologies in Georgia \nis currently well below the regional average (a detailed description and analysis is \nprovided in the next section). For example, according to the Financial Inclusion survey \nof the World Bank, in 2014 the percentage of adults with a debit card was 39.7% of \nthe population, which is more than 10 percentage points lower than in the rest of \nEurope and Central Asia.  \n   \n                                                 \n27  Georgian National Public Opinion Survey on Remittances, July 2007, EBRD. \n28  National Bank of Georgia.

Financial executives in \nGeorgia point to the low usage of financial technologies, such as ATMs, mobile, and e-\nbanking, but the trend is improving rapidly. One of the reasons behind this is the \nrelatively low internet usage in the country \u2013 only 50% of the population reported to \nbe internet users in 2016 (this is below the 62% in Armenia, 78.2% in Azerbaijan, and \n63.7% in Europe and Central Asia developing countries). Also, as mentioned before, a \nvery low percentage of Georgian youth are using banking services. However, as more \nand more young people enter the job market, the number of financial technology users \nis increasing, underlying the positive trend in usage.  \nThe low usage of financial technologies increases the cost of doing business for banks. \nThe  share  of  personnel  expenses  and  the  share  of  fixed  assets  and  inventory \nexpenses in total expenses in the Georgian banking system have not changed much in \nthe last 15 years and amounted to 24% and 5% respectively in 2017.  \n2.9  P2P Lending and Crowdfunding and Cryptocurrencies \nIn Georgia, new financial technologies include P2P lending platforms (e.g. among the \nmost popular ones is Mintos.com), which work with various loan originators in Georgia. \nUnfortunately, as mentioned earlier, there is a conspicuous lack of reliable data on  \nthe size of this market. Based on the incomplete data obtained from the website of the \nP2P platform, the effective APR charged to borrowers by loan originators can be from \n24% to 236%.31 The interest rates offered to P2P investors range from 15.8% to \n11.4%.32 The amount of loans originated by these companies since founding range \nfrom \u20ac45 million to \u20ac203 million.33 Such operations are typically outside the regulatory \nreach of the National Bank of Georgia. The online lenders are governed by the Civil \nCode of Georgia, which was recently updated to prohibit predatory lending.34  \nSimilar to P2P lending, crowdfunding could potentially provide small investors with \naccess to investment opportunities by raising funds from a large number of individuals \nor investors through online web-based platforms. However, this type of non-traditional \nfunding is associated with a number of risks (fraud; asymmetric information; short-term \nnature of investments, etc.). Currently, there is very little reliable data available on \ncrowdfunding  opportunities  for  small  enterprises  in  Georgia,  and  the  market  for \ncrowdfunding is largely underdeveloped. Thus, crowdfunding still remains outside \nof  the  regulatory  realm  of  NBG.  However,  Georgian  government  has  already \nannounced  legislative  amendments  that  will  make  it  easier  to  finance  investment \nprojects using crowdfunding platforms. \nThe  worldwide  cryptocurrency  boom  reached  Georgia  quite  early.  The  country \nmanaged to become a leader in mining cryptocurrencies due to cheap electricity, a \nliberal legislative system, and government-awarded privileges. According to a Global \nCryptocurrency  Benchmarking  Study  carried  out  by  the  Cambridge  Center  for \nAlternative Finance, in 2017 Georgia was in the second place globally in terms of \nenergy  consumption  for  mining  cryptocurrencies.  Cryptocurrencies  are  not \nspecifically regulated in Georgia, although they have gained such popularity in the \n                                                 \n31  Information  on  loan  originators  from  Georgia  retrieved  from  the  mintos.com  website \nhttps://www.mintos.com/en/loan-originators/ \n32  Ibid.  \n33  Ibid.  \n34  See Section 5 of this document for a more detailed description of the relevant changes to the Civil Code \nof Georgia.  \n9 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 849  Babych, Grigolia, and Keshelava \n \ncountry  that  NBG  issued  a  special  statement,  warning  citizens  about  the  risks \nassociated  with  cryptocurrencies.  In  this  statement,  NBG  clearly  indicates  that \ncryptocurrencies are not a legal means of payment in Georgia and there is no agency \nthat protects citizens against risks.35 However, regulators have welcomed the use of \nblockchain technologies. In 2016, the Georgian government,36 even started to use \nblockchain technology for storing the registration data of the Georgian Public Registry\u2019s \nland and real property. Furthermore, the Georgian Ministry of Justice plans to introduce \nblockchain for business registration.  \nImproving financial technologies and access to them is one of the most important \nchallenges for the Georgian financial system. Higher demand for internet banking and \nother distance banking services will reduce the operational costs of commercial banks, \nreduce interest rates, and improve access to finance for individuals and firms through \nregulated financial institutions. \n3.  STATUS OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION  \nFOR INDIVIDUALS AND SMES  \nDifferent studies on financial inclusion, in particular cross-country studies, tend to use a \nwide variety of indicators to measure financial inclusion. Mostly the choice of indicators \nsuitable for cross-country analysis depends on data availability. The set of indicators \ntypically  used  in  the  financial  access  literature  can  be  grouped  into  the  following \ncategories:  \nAccess indicators (the number of ATMs, bank branches per 1,000 adults, the number \nof PSP branches, etc.); Outreach indicators (such as geographical and demographic \npenetration  of  financial  services);  Usage  indicators  (number  of  debit  and  credit \naccounts, the volume of deposits and lending to SMEs and households, etc.); Quality \nindicators (disclosure requirement, dispute resolution, cost of usage).  \nIn this section, we will summarize the status and identify the main trends in financial \ninclusion for both individuals and SMEs in Georgia and put these trends in a wider \nregional context.  \n3.1  Access Indicators \n3.1.1  Access to ATMs, Banks, and Payment Services \nThe figures below compare the number of commercial banks\u2019 branches and ATMs  \nper 100,000 adults in the South Caucasus.

For \nexample, the number of POS terminals has increased three-fold in the last 5 years. The \nnumber of branches of Payment Service Providers (PSP) has also increased quite \ndramatically, from 641 to 1,769 in 5 years.  \n3.1.2  Geographic and Demographic Outreach \nOne of the first indicators of geographic outreach in financial services is the number of \nbank  branches  and  ATMs  available  outside  the  major  cities  (Tbilisi,  Batumi,  and \nKutaisi). The data shows a clear improvement in the absolute number of ATMs and \nbank branches available in the regions (the number of ATMs outside the three major \n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 849  Babych, Grigolia, and Keshelava \n \ncities rose from just 31 in 2005 to 674 in 2016; the number of bank branches grew from \n141 in 2005 to 427 in 2016). Yet, a significant  share  of  the  population  in  the \nregions of Georgia remains underserved. According to the latest (2014) Census \nfigures, the Georgian population in the three largest cities accounts for 36.5% of the \ntotal population. In the same time, the bulk of access to financial services was \nconcentrated in the largest cities. This can be illustrated by the simple fact that the \nshare of ATMs in the three largest cities compared to the total number of ATMs in the \ncountry was about 70% in 2016, much higher than the share of the population living in \nthese cities. The share of ATMs in the three largest cities was even higher in 2005, \nreaching 83% of the total. Similarly, the share of bank branches in the three largest \ncities  is  about  56%  of  the  total,  although,  as  mentioned  earlier,  the  share  of  the \npopulation living in the largest cities is about 36.5%.  \n3.2  Usage Indicators \n3.2.1  Deposit or Savings Accounts \nTable 1 below gives a snapshot of the deposit/savings account access status for  \nthe adult population in Georgia, 2014, in comparison with the ECA region and lower \nmiddle-income countries.  \nTable 1: Select Financial Inclusion Indicators for Georgia, 2017 \nEurope & Central \nFinancial Inclusion Indicators for  Asia (excluding high  All Lower Middle-\nGeorgia (2017)  Country Data  income)  Income Countries \nAccounts (% age 15+)       \nAll adults  61.2  65.3  57.8 \nWomen  63.6  62.5  53.0 \nAdults belonging to the poorest 40%  46.1  56.3  50.7 \nYoung adults (% ages 15\u201324)  30.7  50.1  49.4 \nAdults living in rural areas  55.1  61.7  57.6 \nSource: Global Financial Inclusion Survey, WB. \nThe most striking feature of financial inclusion in Georgia is the low percentage of \nyoung adults with deposit or savings accounts (30.7%, as compared to 50.1% in \nthe ECA region- almost 20 percentage point difference in 2017). Even though, the \ncurrent situation shows a dramatic improvement from 2014, when the data showed that \nonly 9.9% of young adults in Georgia had a deposit or a savings account. This result is \nlikely driven first by the low rate of economic activity among youth (57.6% of the 20\u201324 \nage cohort in 2016 were economically active) and high rate of unemployment in this \ncohort (30% in 2016). Secondly, lack of economic independence leads to the lack of \nfinancial inclusion among the youth.  \nAs the data in Table 1 indicates, adults  belonging  to  the  poorest  40%  of  the \npopulation are also underserved compared to the regional average (ECA) and to the \nindicator for lower middle-income economies. On the other hand, the share of women \nwith deposit or savings accounts in Georgia is about 63.6%. This number is higher \nthan in other low middle-income countries (53% of the population), and also higher (by \nabout one percentage points) than in the ECA region.  \n12 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 849  Babych, Grigolia, and Keshelava \n \n3.2.2  Credit Usage Indicators  \nIn terms of access to credit, Georgia is one of the countries with the greatest ease \nof access in the South Caucasus.37  \nFigure 7: Getting Credit: Distance from the Frontier  \nin the South Caucasus Countries \n \nSource: G-20 Financial Inclusion Indicators. \nFigure 8: Borrowers from Commercial Banks per 1,000 Adults \n \nSource: IMF Financial Access Survey (FAS). \n                                                 \n37  According to G-20 Financial Inclusion Indicators, the Getting Credit indicator measures \u201cthe strength of \ncredit reporting systems and the effectiveness of collateral and bankruptcy laws in facilitating lending. \nMeasured as \u2018distance to frontier\u2019...

According to the IMF methodology the NPL share was just 3.3% on \naverage in the same period). This discrepancy suggests that financially vulnerable \ngroups of population still remain outside the realm of bank lending.  \nThus, in Georgia the rapid growth in consumer credit prompted concerns about the \nsustainability of credit expansion. Georgia\u2019s main financial concern was not so much \nabout access to credit, but about making sure that borrowers were protected and  \nwere  making  informed  decisions.  Since  then,  the  government  of  Georgia  and  \nthe NBG called for stronger consumer protection measures, pushed for rapid  \nde-dollarization of small and medium-size loans and stepped up the efforts to \npromote financial literacy. Sections 5 and 6 of the paper examine these issues in \ngreater detail.  \n                                                 \n38  Most likely the decline was caused by the fact that fewer households qualified for loans from banks in \nthat period.  \n14 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 849  Babych, Grigolia, and Keshelava \n \n3.3  Financial Inclusion of SMEs \nAs mentioned earlier, while the financial access indicators for households were growing \nrapidly, the same indicators for SMEs stayed largely the same. According to the World \nBank Enterprise Survey 2013 data, 20.4% of SMEs identified finance as a major \nconstraint (in the ECA region this figure for SMEs is 16.4%).  \nOutstanding loans to SMEs accounted for only 7.5% of GDP in 2016, while outstanding \nloans to households account for 26% of GDP in the same year. The share of SMEs \nwith a bank loan or line of credit constituted 30.3% of the firms, the same percentage \nas in the ECA region and 2 percentage points higher than the world average.  \nThis indicates that while receiving a loan per se may not be a problem for SMEs in \nGeorgia (as compared to the ECA region and other countries), securing the \ndesired amount of funding may be problematic. From the table one can see for \nexample that only 7.2% of SMEs reported their recent loan application rejected, while \nthe figure is much higher, 14.6%, in the ECA countries.  \nTable 2: Enterprise Survey for Georgia, 2013 \nEurope &  All \nGeorgia  Georgia  Central  Countries, \nIndicators, Enterprise Survey, 2013  All Firms  SMEs  Asia SMEs  SMEs \nPercentage of firms with a bank loan/line of credit  35.8  30.3  32.7  28.3 \nProportion of loans requiring collateral (%)  95.6  97.9  75.7  77.3 \nValue of collateral needed for a loan (% of the  223.3  232  197.9  217.5 \nloan amount) \nPercentage of firms whose recent loan  4.6  7.2  14.6  14.9 \napplication was rejected \nPercentage of firms using banks to finance  22  15.3  22.3  23.2 \ninvestments \nPercentage of firms identifying access to  18.3  20.4  16.4  27 \nfinance as a major constraint \nSource: World Bank Group. \nFinally, an important indicator of financial access for both households and firms is the \ncost of funds, in Georgia\u2019s case the cost of funds is largely determined by interest rates \non loans charged by different financial institutions. Figure 10 below indicates that real \ninterest rates on loans have been on a declining trajectory since 2012.39 Real interest \nrates went up again briefly in 2015 following the regional crisis and devaluation of GEL, \nthen started falling again from September 2016, when the currency value stabilized.  \nFrom January 2017 a new law prohibited the issue of loans in foreign currency \nfor loan amounts below GEL100,000 (this was part of the de-dollarization campaign \nby NBG and the government). Since most banks and microfinance organizations raise \nfunds  in  US  dollars,  the  cost  of  financing  lari  loans  has  increased.  According  to \ninterviews with bank and MFI executives the cost of hedging the currency risk on a \nlari loan increased from 3\u20134% to over 10%. Part of these cost increases could be \npassed  on  to  the  consumers  in  the  form  of  higher  interest  rates,  although  some \nfinancial institutions opted to keep lending interest rates at about the same level in \n                                                 \n39  The prominent dip and a sharp rise in real interest rates during the years after the financial crisis of \n2008\u20132009 was largely driven by the behavior of the inflation rate, which fell in September 2009 and \nrose sharply again until May 2011.  \n15 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 849  Babych, Grigolia, and Keshelava \n \norder to avoid raising the risk of their customer pool.

For households, the main concern is not so much the access to credit, but \nrather low levels of income, low levels of savings, provision for retirement, and \nlow levels of financial literacy.  \nThe SMEs in Georgia report problems with access to finance. According to the data, \naccess to deposit and savings accounts is high for SMEs, but in fact SMEs save very \nlittle. Moreover, while the number of SMEs with loans and lines of credit from the bank \nis reasonable (on a level with the world and regional average), SMEs may be credit \nconstrained in the sense that the amount of funds they can secure from banks is \nseen  as  insufficient  for  the  development  of  the  business.  Interviews  with \ncommercial bank and MFI executives point largely in the same direction \u2013 many SMEs \nwould like to borrow more than their financial situation could allow.  \n4.  BARRIERS TO FINANCIAL INCLUSION \n4.1  Supply Side Barriers  \nThe supply side barriers to financial inclusion refer to the factors which limit the ability \nof financial institutions to extend deposit, savings, and/or credit to households and \nbusinesses.  Among  them  the  literature  distinguishes  between  market  driven, \nregulatory, and infrastructure-related barriers.  \n16 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 849  Babych, Grigolia, and Keshelava \n \nAmong the main markers of market-driven barriers to financial inclusion identified in \nthe literature are:  \n\u2022  relatively high maintenance costs of small deposits and loans;  \n\u2022  high costs of providing financial services in small towns and rural areas \n(e.g. transport-related problems); \n\u2022  information asymmetry on the market (lack of credit data about the clients \nand/or lack of usable collateral);  \n\u2022  lack of convenient access points to financial services. \nAmong the markers for regulatory barriers are:  \n\u2022  strict requirements for opening branches and ATMs;  \n\u2022  strict identification requirements which can limit access of poor households;  \n\u2022  restrictions  on  foreign  ownership  may  restrict  the  entry  of  financial \ninstitutions, including MFIs. \nThe infrastructure barriers could be inferred from:  \n\u2022  lack of reliable payments and settlements system;  \n\u2022  limited availability of phone access (either fixed or mobile phones);  \n\u2022  lack of convenient transport to ATMs; \n\u2022  lack of reliable internet connection.  \nFrom the data presented in the previous section, small town and rural areas in Georgia \nmay indeed be underserved in terms of access to financial infrastructure, such as \nATMs,  bank  branches,  etc.  Georgia  is  behind  the  regional  average  (Europe  and \nCentral Asia) in access of rural, and particularly poor households to financial services, \nsuch as deposit accounts.40 The existing data, unfortunately, does not provide a clear \nanswer as to the drivers behind low financial inclusion figures.  \nWe have conducted a series of interviews with the executives of large commercial \nbanks  and  MFIs  in  Georgia  to  better  assess  the  issue  of  supply-side  barriers. \nAccording to the interviews, the cost of servicing small loan and deposit accounts \nis not the main obstacle to financial inclusion. The costs of providing services \noutside major cities and servicing the lower-income population may indeed be higher, \nespecially  for  MFIs  which  mainly  serve  households,  including  lower  income \nhouseholds. For MFIs, about 6 percentage points of the interest rate on household \nloans are due to operational cost requirements. Thus, the  operational  costs  are \nestimated to contribute about one-quarter to the total cost of credit. This includes \nthe need to maintain and train staff (one of the large MFIs with a loan portfolio of \nGEL150  million  maintains  50  branches  around  the  country  and  a  staff  of  around  \n800 employees).  \n   \n                                                 \n40  Table 1 indicates that 46.1% of adults belonging to the poorest 40% of the population have deposit \naccounts, which is about 5 percentage points lower than in other lower middle-income countries, and 10 \npercentage points lower than in the ECA region. About 55% of adults in rural areas are served with \ndeposit accounts, which is close to 7 percentage points lower than in the ECA region, but the \npercentage of the rural population served is about the same in other lower-middle income countries. \n17 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 849  Babych, Grigolia, and Keshelava \n \nInformational  asymmetry  is  less  of  a  problem  for  MFIs,  who  adhere  to  a \nrelationship-based banking model. Even commercial banks in Georgia have largely \navoided this problem thanks to the credit database maintained and shared among \nthe  financial  institutions.  The  subscribers  to  the  database  can  see  whether  a \nparticular physical person or a company has ever defaulted, the number of defaults, \nand the size of defaults. The presence of a customer\u2019s name in the database is not an \nautomatic reason to disqualify a loan application, and financial institutions look at the \npattern of defaults or amount of defaults to assess the client\u2019s creditworthiness.41  \nTransport and access to financial services is not a major problem, considering \nthat large MFIs and the commercial banks oriented on servicing small deposits and \nloans (e.g. Liberty Bank, which services government-provided pension plans for the \nelderly population) have already established extensive networks outside of the major \ncities,  relying  on  the  so-called  mobile  branches  to  reach  their  client  base.  The \nregulatory barriers to access in Georgia are probably least problematic, as there \nare no strict requirements on operating branches and ATMs, and no restrictions on \nforeign ownership for financial institutions (which could limit the amount of foreign funds \nentering  the  market).  The  current  regulations  on  identification  requirements  are \nindeed cited by the banks as one of the problems for increasing financial access. \nAccording  to  regulations,  opening  a  bank  account  requires  the  physical  presence  \nof a customer (business or a household client) in the branch to sign the required \ndocuments. Although e-signature technology is available, it cannot be used at present \nto open a deposit account.  \nThe infrastructure  barriers,  such  as  poor  internet  connection,  lack  of  phone \n(mobile or landline) network, transport, etc. are not a major concern for the \nfinancial institutions. The number of mobile subscriptions in Georgia is quite high  \n\u2013 129 per 100 persons in 2016, which is higher than in other countries of the South \nCaucasus and higher than in the region (Europe and Central Asia\u2019s average is 125 per \n100 persons). Internet coverage is available throughout the country, although internet \nusage in Georgia is not as widespread as mobile phone usage. According to World \nBank data only 50% of the population in Georgia use the internet, as compared to \n73.9% in the ECA region, 62% in Armenia, and 78.2% in Azerbaijan.  \nWhile the use of mobile or internet banking may not be widespread, the usage is \nrapidly improving, suggesting that there is large potential for including a larger \nshare of the population in the financial services.  \n4.2  Demand Side Barriers \nDemand side barriers to financial inclusion consist of all the factors that can limit the \ndemand of households for financial services. The major factors include but are not \nlimited to the following aspects:  \n\u2022  low income levels of the population;  \n\u2022  lack of knowledge (low levels of financial literacy);  \n\u2022  lack of trust towards financial institutions; \n\u2022  institutional  aspects,  for  example,  bankruptcy  law,  assessment  of \ncreditworthiness, etc.  \n \n                                                 \n41  See Section 5 for more information on CreditInfo, the private credit bureau in Georgia.  \n18 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 849  Babych, Grigolia, and Keshelava \n \nThe demand side barriers to financial inclusion are indeed very prominent in Georgia.  \nIn particular, the low income levels of the population can be named among the most \nimportant  barriers.  One  piece  of  evidence  in  this  regard  is  the  high  share  of  the \npopulation in Georgia living on less than $3.10 per day. The share of the population \nbelow this threshold in Georgia was 34.8% on average between 2005 and 2015. In \n2015,  the  rate  was  25.3%42).  Such  high  poverty  rates  are  not  common  in  other \ncountries in the region. Armenia, for example, has a comparable GDP per capita,43 but \nthe share of the population living on less than $3.10 per day was on average 20% in \nthe same period of time, and only 13.5% in 2015.  \nSeveral surveys44 which touched upon the savings behavior of households in Georgia \nreveal that only a small share of the population manages to save money in some form \n(the estimates in different years range from as low as 16% in 2011 to 37.9% in 2016). \nIn  addition,  the  surveys  reveal  (OECD/INFE  survey)  that  61%  of  Georgians  were \nunable to make ends meet at least once in the last 12 months, and 45% resorted to \nborrowing. The Savings Behavior Survey (2011),45 which makes a distinction between \nrural, urban, and Tbilisi responses, showed that in villages the percentage of household \nwho currently had savings was lower (12% vs. 16% overall). The same survey revealed \nthat people with a monthly family income of GEL700 (about $424 at the time) were \nthree times more likely to save money than people with income below that level.  \nLow financial literacy is another serious barrier which is discussed in more detail in \nSection 6 of the paper. Lack of trust towards the financial system is not a big \nproblem in Georgia. The country enjoys high levels of popular trust in banks, which is \nconfirmed in several surveys. For example, according to the ISET-PI/TBC survey of \nfinancial literacy, 79% of the surveyed population unconditionally trust the banks with \ntheir  money,  while  85%  of  the  population  would  not  entrust  their  money  to  other \nfinancial institutions (e.g. credit union or microfinance). This result is corroborated by \nevidence from the World Gallup Poll (2013)46 which showed that in Georgia 62% of \nrespondents reported to have confidence in the banks. In fact, Georgia\u2019s trust in \nbanks was 5th highest among European countries.  \nOne survey result that stands apart from these findings is the Caucasus Research \nResource Center (CRRC) poll Caucasus Barometer of 2015. In the survey one of the \nquestions people were asked was \u201chow much you trust or distrust Georgian banks?\u201d As \nmany  as  34%  of  respondents  fully  or  somewhat  distrusted  Georgian  banks.  The \nreasons for this result are discussed in more detail in the financial literacy section of  \nthe paper.  \n   \n                                                 \n42  World Bank data.  \n43  According to World Bank data, $3,606 in Armenia to $3,853 in Georgia in 2016 \n44  Among them: Saving Behavior Assessment Survey in Georgia, 2011, ACT Research, Saving Banks \nFoundation  for  International  Cooperation,  January  and  February  2010\u20132011,  Tbilisi,  Georgia \nhttps://nbg.gov.ge/cp/uploads/research/sbfic.pdf ; ISET-PI and TBC Bank Financial Literacy Survey  \nin Georgia, 2016 (available only in Georgian); Georgian National Public Opinion on Remittances, \nEBRD-ETC  initiative,  January  2007.

Interviews conducted in \nthe course of this study with microfinance organizations suggested that microfinances \ndo not automatically exclude people from borrowing on the basis of low credit score \nand tend to look at the entire credit history and current circumstances of the household \nbefore making a decision on lending.  \n5.  REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AND FINANCIAL \nINCLUSION  \n5.1  Regulatory Framework and Policies to Promote Financial \nInclusion for SMEs and Households \nCurrently  in  Georgia  there  is  no  official  document  outlining  the  country\u2019s  financial \ninclusion strategy. Greater financial access to SMEs, however, is a stated priority for \nthe government in several strategic documents, such as Georgia 2020 Socio-economic \nDevelopment Program,47 and in SME Development Strategy of Georgia 2016\u20132020.48 \nAccording to the SME development strategy document, improving access to finance for \nSMEs would be achieved via the following policy actions:  \n\u2022  improving financial literacy among SMEs \n\u2022  training  to  help  SMEs  conduct  financial  reporting  and  meet  the  IFRS \nrequirements \n\u2022  increase knowledge of fundraising among SMEs \n\u2022  attract SME-oriented private equity funds to Georgia \n\u2022  via existing programs, like \u201cProduce in Georgia\u201d enhancing existing schemes of \nSME financing via commercial banks and MFIs  \n\u2022  Improve SME financing through grants. \nCurrently, the government program that is specifically aimed at SMEs is the Micro  \nand  Small  Business  Support  Project  of  Enterprise  Georgia.49 The  project  offers \nfinancial  assistance  to  startups  as  well  as  expanding  companies  in  the  form  of  \ngrants between GEL5,000 and GEL15,000. The project started in 2016, and in total \n5,313 entrepreneurs were supported by an average grant of GEL7,276 per project.50  \n                                                 \n47  Social-economic Development Strategy for Georgia \u201cGeorgia 2020\u201d, Government of Georgia, 2016 \nhttp://www.mrdi.gov.ge/sites/default/files/social-\neconomic_development_strategy_of_georgia_georgia_2020.pdf \n48  SME  Development  Strategy  for  Georgia  2016-2020,  Government  of  Georgia,  2016 \nhttp://www.economy.ge/uploads/files/2017/ek__politika/eng_sme_development_strategy.pdf \n49  Enterprise Georgia is a government agency established under the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable \nDevelopment. It is mandated to facilitate private sector (and in particular SME) development through a \nvariety of financial and technical support mechanisms, as well as export support.  \n50  A different program, \u201cProduce in Georgia,\u201d that is aiming at financial, technical, and infrastructural \nsupport of enterprises covers SMEs only partially. The requirements of the program apply mostly to \nmedium and large size companies. The program has three main components: (i) access to finance \ncomponent (co-financing the loan interest and supporting with the secondary collateral); (ii) technical \nsupport (supporting the enterprise with training and consultations); and (iii) infrastructural component \n(transfer state property to the beneficiary for GEL1).  \n20 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 849  Babych, Grigolia, and Keshelava \n \nThe same agencies are implementing different projects with smaller scale and specific \nobjectives. For example, Enterprise Georgia is supervising a separate project for the \npromotion of hospitality. APMA51 is involved in agro insurance, garden development, \nand  other  agriculture-related  programs.  In  addition,  the  Georgia\u2019s  Innovation  and \nTechnology Agency is implementing financing programs for startups only in the field  \nof commercialization of innovative projects. So far six startups were supported by the \nprogram.  All  these  programs  partially  cover  SMEs  in  certain  sectors,  but \nunfortunately do not act as a holistic mechanism for the support of a wide variety \nof SMEs in the country.  \nAs far as financial access of households is concerned, Georgia has a comprehensive \nfinancial education strategy developed by the National Bank of Georgia.52 The strategy \nis described in more detail in Section 6 below. The country, however, does not have \nany government-managed debt relief programs to help alleviate existing debt burden.  \n5.1.1  Deposit Insurance \nA deposit insurance scheme was launched in Georgia in 1 January 2018. According to \nthe scheme, all bank deposits in Georgia are insured for up to GEL5,00053 ($2,066 \nequivalent).54 The economic literature suggests that explicit deposit insurance might \nincrease  depositors\u2019  confidence  and  prevent  bank  runs.  However,  the  deposit \ninsurance scheme also gives commercial banks incentive to undertake unnecessary \nrisks (the \u201cmoral hazard\u201d problem) and increase lending and borrowing spreads.55  \nThe direct effect of the newly introduced deposit insurance on financial stability is likely \nto be quite limited, as Georgia already has a successful regulatory framework56 that \nhas proved to be resilient toward large negative shocks on the financial market.57 Large \ncommercial banks that currently dominate the financial market, already enjoy implicit \ndeposit insurance.58 The newly introduced deposit insurance, however, may have an \neffect on people with lower levels of financial literacy. For them, a deposit insurance \nscheme may deliver a much clearer guarantee of trustworthiness than any refinement \nof regulatory framework (such as the introduction of Basel III).  \n5.1.2  Credit Data \nIn the early years of transition (till 2005), Georgia had neither a private nor a public \ncredit bureau which would assess creditworthiness of individuals and legal entities.  \nIn  2005,  \u201cCreditInfo  Georgia\u201d  was  created  as  a  joint  venture  between  CreditInfo \nInternational and three large commercial banks (Procredit Bank, TBC Bank, and Bank \n                                                 \n51  Agricultural Projects Management Agency. \n52  National  Strategy  for  Financial  Education  in  Georgia,  the  National  Bank  of  Georgia,  2016 \nhttps://www.nbg.gov.ge/cp/uploads/stategy/FinLit_Strategy_ENG.pdf  \n53  \u201cWho  is  Insured?\u201d  Deposit  Insurance  Agency  of  Georgia,  2017,  http://diagency.ge/en/who%20is \n%20insured \n54  Converted using the exchange rate of Q3 2017.  \n55  Carapella, Francesca, and Giorgio Di Giorgio.

The coverage increased to 95.7% of the adult population in \n2017. This is higher than the same measure for countries in the European Union in \n2017 (54.2%) and ECA developing countries (40.6%).  \n5.2  Structure of Regulatory Framework \nIn Georgia, the basic relationships between lenders and borrowers are regulated by the \nCivil Code of Georgia, while the main institution responsible for handling supervision \nof the financial sector in the framework of the financial stability is the National Bank of \nGeorgia.62 One of the main responsibilities (and targets) of NBG is to contribute to the \nstable  functioning  of  the  financial  sector.  Therefore,  NBG  has  been  granted  full \nauthority to carry out supervision of activities of commercial banks and non-bank \nfinancial institutions: credit unions, microfinance organizations, securities registrars, \nbrokerage companies (excluding insurance brokers), stock exchanges, etc. Central \nBank  is  also  authorized  to  regulate  money  transfer  agents  and  foreign  exchange \nbureaus to prevent legalization of illicit income and circulation of forged money.63 \nThe Organic Law of Georgia on the National Bank of Georgia also defines the notion of \nthe Qualified Credit Institution \u2013 a legal person (excluding commercial banks) that \nsatisfies at least one of the following criteria: \n\u2022  Attracts funds from more than 400 people; \n\u2022  The amount of funds attracted exceeds GEL5 million ($2.07 million equivalent). \nThe supervision of insurance companies and pension schemes is conducted by a \nseparate agency, State Insurance Supervision Service of Georgia.64 Other financial \ninstitutions, including pawnshops and online loan providers are outside of NBG \nsupervision and are regulated only by the Civil Code of Georgia.  \n5.3  New Regulations Affecting Consumer Protection  \nand Access to Finance \nAt the end of 2016, the Georgian Parliament approved the law on an amendment to the \nCivil Code of Georgia. The Georgian Government introduced the following additional \nregulations  related  to  lender  liabilities,  interest  rates  on  loans,  and  restrictions  on \nattracting new funds:  \n   \n                                                 \n59  International Risk Partnership (IRP).

This regulation aims to facilitate de-dollarization of loans and \nfurther reduce foreign currency (FX) risks for borrowers.  \nThe efforts to impose interest rate caps and de-dollarize lending aimed to protect \nconsumers became a political issue after a series of lari devaluations of 2013\u20132016. \nThe  unintended  consequences  of  these  regulations  could  be  the  higher  cost  of \nhedging  instruments  for  banks  and  MFIs;  higher  domestic  currency  interest \nrates for households, and, consequently, less affordable loans for households. \nOn  the  other  hand,  lending  in  foreign  currency  for  legal  entities,  such  as  \nSMEs,  could  become  cheaper.  This  would  be  particularly  advantageous  for  \nexport-oriented SMEs. \n6.  FINANCIAL EDUCATION AND FINANCIAL LITERACY \nIN GEORGIA: WHAT DO WE KNOW? \nFinancial literacy is indeed seen by many stakeholders (commercial banks, MFIs, the \nNational Bank of Georgia) as the key  to  improving  the  financial  well-being  of \nhouseholds  in  Georgia. Since several waves of lari devaluation hit borrowers in \n2013\u20132016,  the  Georgian  Government  has  been  pushing  for  tougher  consumer \nprotection and sweeping de-dollarization measures, while the National Bank of Georgia \nwas  also  advocating  for  the  improvement  of  financial  literacy  levels  among  the  \ngeneral population.  \nAs part of the effort to establish a baseline for financial literacy outreach in the country, \na number of studies and surveys have been undertaken. Among them, were 1) the \nfinancial literacy survey conducted by the ISET Policy Institute, together with the TBC \nbank and TNS65; 2) the financial literacy study conducted by NBG66; and 3) the \nOECD/INFE International Survey of Adult Financial Literacy Competencies.67 The main \nresults of these surveys are summarized below.  \n   \n                                                 \n65  http://iset-pi.ge/index.php/en/private-sector-projects/completed-projects/1360-financial-consciousness-\nresearch-in-georgia-geo  \n66  Financial Literacy and Financial Inclusion Study.

The  literacy  questions  assessed  knowledge  about  simple  and  compounded \ninterest rate, inflation, financial risks, and effective interest rates (fees and commissions \nattributed  to  credits  and  installments).  One  of  the  surprising  findings  was  that  \nonly  5.8%  of  the  surveyed  population  answered  all  four  questions  correctly;  \n42% of the population\u2019s knowledge fell in the moderate range (two or three correct \nanswers), while the remaining 52% exhibited low levels of financial literacy (one or no \ncorrect answers).  \nThe country survey indicated strong regional disparities in financial literacy, \nparticularly between the capital city and other areas of the country. This likely mirrors \nthe differences in access to finance. The Georgian survey finds that financial literacy \nis significantly higher in the capital, Tbilisi (81% of the population with high financial \nliteracy level, are from Tbilisi).  \nIt is difficult to say whether lack of financial literacy is an obstacle for greater financial \naccess  or  vice  versa,  but  generally,  people  with  lower  educational  attainment  \nwere less likely to answer questions correctly: 78% of the respondents with all \ncorrect answers, held a university or equivalent diploma. Also, respondents with only \nprimary and secondary education were more likely to report the \u201cdo not know\u201d \noption. Yet, despite the low levels of financial literacy revealed in the survey, only 14% \nof the population admitted a lack of knowledge in finances.  \n6.2  Financial Attitudes and Behavior \nRecording expenditures is not used as a tool to control finances \u2013 only 8.3% of \nthe population conduct detailed recording of expenditures.  \nFigure 11: Attitudes toward Expenditure  \n(%) \n \n# of respondents: 1000. \nSource: ISET-PI TBC Financial Literacy Survey.  \n \n24 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 849  Babych, Grigolia, and Keshelava \n \nThe  population  of  Georgia  tends  to  be  disciplined  in  tax  obligations;  86%  of  the \nrespondents reply that they do not delay tax payments. Also, they are very cautious \nabout buying new things \u2013 68% state that they think and analyze if they can afford the \npurchase before they buy. The reason for this pattern of cautious behavior is likely to \nbe the low levels of income rather than high levels of financial literacy.  \nAccording to the survey, trust toward the banking system in Georgia is one of \nthe highest in the region and even in the EU area; 79% of the surveyed population \nunconditionally trust the banks, while 85% of the population do not entrust their money \nto  other  financial  institutions  (microfinances,  credit  unions,  etc.).  The  conservative \nregulation of the banking system by NBG, has led to a stable and credible banking \nsystem, while the non-regulated part of the financial sector is seen as unreliable in the \neyes of the population. This result should be treated with caution, however. As \nmentioned before, trust in the banking system greatly depends on the question that is \nbeing asked. For example, if a question is asked about trust in the banking system in \ngeneral, the percentage of positive responses is lower68 (this may be because people \ndo not trust banks to provide them with fair lending terms, although they may trust them \nwith the deposits).  \nFigure 12: Trust in the Banking System  \n(%) \n \nSource: ISET-PI TBC Financial Literacy Survey.  \nDespite the high credibility of the regulated part of the financial market, long-term \nfinancial planning and bank saving are not common among the respondents. \nOnly 12.4% of respondents are saving for retirement purposes; 14.3% of the population \nwill be totally dependent on the basic state pension, which is about at the minimum \nsubsistence level in Georgia. 25.1% hope to have a job during his/her retirement.  \nSeveral findings in the survey indicate that together with the low level of financial \nliteracy, low income remains one of the main obstacles to more sophisticated \nfinancial inclusion of the population. Only 35% of the respondents managed to save \nduring  2015,  while  57%  took  a  loan  during  the  same  period.  Among  those  who \nmanaged to save, 30% made a deposit saving, while 44% kept their cash outside the \nbank \u2013 the cash savings were most likely intended for very short-term goals/purposes, \nnot contributing to long-term planning of the future.  \n                                                 \n68  CRRC Caucasus Barometer, 2015, http://caucasusbarometer.org/en/cb2015ge/TRUBANK/ \n25 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 849  Babych, Grigolia, and Keshelava \n \nFigure 13: Taking Care of Life in Retirement  \n(%) \n \n# of respondents: 1000. \nSource: ISET-PI TBC Financial Literacy Survey. \nAccording to the OECD/INFE International Survey of Adult Financial Literacy \nCompetencies,69 Georgia is amongst the countries where families have trouble \nmaking ends meet. To compare, the shares of the population who were unable to \nmake ends meet at least once in the last 12 months were as follows: Thailand (64%), \nGeorgia (61%), Belarus (57%), Albania (54%), and Turkey (50%). Furthermore, at least \nfour in ten respondents resorted to borrowing to make ends meet in Thailand (45%), \nGeorgia (45%), Turkey (42%), Albania (41%), and Belarus (41%). This indicates a  \nhigh level of financial fragility in these countries, possibly due to low and/or \nfluctuating incomes. \nAnother important aspect of financial literacy is familiarity with financial products. Even \nthough the use of financial products in Georgia is not low, a significant share of the \npopulation does not understand the intricacies of various financial products. According \nto the study/survey conducted by NBG in 2016,70 people tend not to shop around for \nbest offers on financial products and take the first available deal that is offered to them.  \nThe NBG survey further characterized the segments of population in Georgia according \nto their financial attitudes and behavior. According to the survey only 11.7% of the \npopulation  can  be  characterized  as  Business  minded  \u2013  i.e.  distributing  monthly \nincome, making at least small savings, setting long-term financial goals. The financial \nliteracy score was the highest (65.6 out of 100) in this segment of the population. \nFinancially responsible people (demonstrate practical financial behavior, who meet \nfinancial responsibilities, maintain close control of their finances, etc.) comprise just \nover one third of the population \u2013 34.3% \u2013 and have the second highest financial \nliteracy score (63 out of 100). Unfortunately, the remainder of the population (54%)  \ncan be characterized as either Financially fearful (21.6% \u2013 characterized by poor \nfinancial capabilities, fear towards financial affairs), Burdened by debt (16% \u2013 hardly \n                                                 \n69  https://www.oecd.org/daf/fin/financial-education/OECD-INFE-International-Survey-of-Adult-Financial-\nLiteracy-Competencies.pdf \n70  Financial Literacy and Financial Inclusion Study.

People \nin  these  categories  had  the  lowest  financial  literacy  scores  ranging  from  57.7% \n(burdened by debt category) to 49.2% (enjoy spending category). \nAs these surveys show, Georgia has a long way to go to reach the level of the OECD \naverage in financial literacy, behavior, and attitudes. To this end, the National Strategy \nfor Financial Education in Georgia71 has been developed by the NBG and has been \nimplemented since 2016. In the following section of the paper we will summarize the \nmain points of the strategy. \n6.3  Financial Education Strategy of Georgia \nBesides the goal of the overall improvement in financial well-being of the Georgian \npopulation, the strategy\u2019s aim is to protect consumers\u2019 rights. The following are three \nstrategic focus points to help achieve the goals of financial education:  \n\u2022  Raise  awareness  of  the  benefits  of  financial  education \u2013 by enhancing \nawareness of the importance of financial education in society, and stimulating a \ngreater demand for and use of financial education initiatives;  \n\u2022  Enhance coordination and collaboration among stakeholders by optimizing \nresources for achieving synergy, extending the impact and reach of education \ninitiatives, sharing experience and good practice;  \n\u2022  Extend opportunities to learn \u2013 by encouraging life-long learning of financial \nmatters, starting from an early age, and making financial education initiatives \navailable through diversified venues, settings, and languages. \nTo coordinate this effort, the NBG established a Steering Committee comprised of \ndifferent types of stakeholders including the financial institutions (banks and MFIs), \nuniversities, Civil Society, and other government entities for the implementation of the \nstrategy.  The  Committee\u2019s  goal  is to  evaluate  existing  and  future  programs,  raise \ninitiatives, and provide advisory, financial, and technical assistance.  \nAccording to the Strategy, the high-need, vulnerable segments were identified: \n\u2022  The young generation \u2013 pupils and students;  \n\u2022  Unemployed population;  \n\u2022  People employed in large companies and organizations;72  \n\u2022  Rural population;  \n\u2022  People facing special life events (such as the birth of a child, wedding, \nuniversity education, etc.) \nThe guideline for activities under the Strategy for 2017\u20132019 has been drafted, but is \nnot yet enforced. The activities include training, awareness raising campaigns, and \ncommunication  using  various  channels.  It  is  planned  to  integrate  financial  literacy \ntopics in the national curriculum in schools (in math classes and in civil education \nclasses). The pilot of the program, \u201cschool-bank,\u201d is already in action and NBG is \ndelivering training for pupils, as well as trainings for teachers in 11 public schools. \n                                                 \n71  http://nbg.gov.ge/cp/uploads/stategy/FinLit_Strategy_ENG.pdf  \n72  Arguably, these people are not financially vulnerable, but are easy to target by financial education \nprograms at low cost.  \n27 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 849  Babych, Grigolia, and Keshelava \n \n7.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n7.1  Main Takeaways from the Study  \n7.1.1  Adequate Access, but Low Usage of Financial Services in Georgia \nOn  a  number  of  financial  inclusion  indicators,  Georgia  is  outperforming  the  ECA \ndeveloping countries cohort (in particular in terms of access indicators, such as the \nnumber of ATMs, bank branches, POS terminals). Yet, in terms of usage of financial \nproducts  and  technologies,  Georgia  is  still  very  much  behind  the  peer  group  of \ncountries. Strikingly, the percentage of young adults with deposit or savings accounts  \nis very low compared to the regional average (only 9.9%, as compared to 50.1% in the \nECA region). This result is likely driven by the low rate of economic activity among \nyouth  and  a  high  rate  of  unemployment  in  this  cohort.  The  lack  of  economic \nindependence leads to a lack of financial inclusion among the youth. The same factors \nare likely to be responsible for the low usage of financial technologies, such as internet \nand  mobile  banking.  Once  the  current  youth  cohort  becomes  integrated  into  the \neconomic life of the country, the usage of modern financial technologies is expected to \nincrease.  \n7.1.2  Poor Households Remain Underserved \nDespite rapidly growing indicators of access to financial services (such as deposits and \ncredit),  a  significant  cohort  of  the  population  remains  underserved.  This  concerns \nmainly poor and to some extent rural populations. Only 46% of poor adults have a \ndeposit or savings account as opposed to 61% of adults overall. The rural population \nhas adequate (country average) indicators of usage, but is much more likely to be \nengaged  in  low-income  subsistence  agriculture,  less  likely  to  have  accumulated \nsavings, and have lower financial literacy scores. In addition, rural inhabitants dominate \nthe segment of the population that can be described as \u201cfinancially fearful,\u201d according \nto the NBG financial literacy survey.  \n7.1.3  Access to Credit has been Growing Rapidly for Households,  \nbut Not SMEs  \nIndicators of financial access among SMEs have remained largely the same since \n2012. At the same time, credit to households, in particular credit secured by real estate, \nhas been expanding rapidly in the past few years. Indebtedness of households has \nbeen growing rapidly as well. While the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans in \ncommercial banks remained stable, the data from microfinances is different \u2013 the value \nof repossessed property increased sharply around the time of the lari devaluation73. \nThis suggests that the financial strain was experienced mostly by households who did \nnot, for various reasons, qualify for a loan from a commercial bank. In addition, credit \nscore distribution data from the country\u2019s only credit bureau, which covers 88.6% of the \nadult  population,  indicates  that  the  distribution  is  skewed  towards  the  high-risk \ncategory. There are notably more MFI clients in the E3 category than bank clients, as \nbanks have much stricter requirements for giving credit. Rapid growth in consumer \ncredit  prompted  concerns  about  the  sustainability  of  credit  expansion.  Thus,  the \ngovernment  of  Georgia  and  the  NBG  called  for  stronger  consumer  protection \nmeasures,  pushed  for  rapid  de-dollarization  of  small  and  medium-size  loans  and \nstepped up efforts to promote financial literacy. \n                                                 \n73 NBG Statistics.

Yet, \nvarious financial literacy indicators show that the majority of the population is only \nfamiliar with basic financial concepts, like simple interest, inflation, risk and return, etc. \nYet,  slightly  more  complicated  questions  about  calculating  a  simple  interest  on  a \ndeposit or detecting the effect of compounding remain challenging. There is evidence \nthat Georgians choose financial products without \u201cshopping around,\u201d and are in many \ncases unaware of various financial products available to them.  \n7.1.5  Low Levels of Financial Literacy in Conjunction with Low Incomes \nare Among the Main Obstacles to Greater Financial Inclusion \nFinancial literacy and financial inclusion go hand in hand. People with higher levels of \nfinancial literacy tend to save more, are more aware of various financial products, are \nmore responsible borrowers. The data we have analyzed for the purposes of this study \npoints to the conclusion that financial literacy is correlated with income and education \nlevels. While there may be a causal relationship in the direction from financial literacy \nto income level (as financial literacy may proxy ability), one can imagine the reverse \ncausation as well: low income levels may be in part responsible for low levels of \nfinancial inclusion and thus, indirectly, lead to lower levels of financial literacy.  \n7.2  Recommendations  \nThe analysis of various financial inclusion indicators and financial sector policies in \nGeorgia leads us to conclude that the country\u2019s problems with financial inclusion of the \npoor, young, and rural population stem from low income levels as well as low levels of \nfinancial literacy.  \nAs  the  Georgian  authorities  navigate  different  policy  options  to  improve  financial \ninclusion for households and SMEs, they have to keep in mind that financial literacy, \ngeneral education, and income levels are interrelated concepts, and it will not be \npossible to fully address one aspect of the problem (e.g. financial literacy) without \nsimultaneously addressing the issues related to general education and the lack of \nstable incomes.  \nThe government needs to develop a comprehensive national strategy for financial \ninclusion of the population (currently lacking) which will address different aspects of \nthis  problem,  including  consumer  protection,  education,  employment  opportunities, \nand, last but not least, financial literacy. In particular, promoting employment among \nyouth  could  go  a  long  way  towards  their  greater  financial  integration  and  more \nresponsible financial behavior in the future.  \nGreater financial access for SMEs remains a challenge. SMEs face a chicken and \negg problem, where they find it hard to grow without greater access to finance, while \nbanks are reluctant to lend in excess of what the financial situation of these firms would \ncurrently allow. The solution to this problem could be to experiment with different \napproaches,  which  do  not  necessarily  imply  interest  rate  subsidies  or  collateral \npledges. Education programs and training for SME entrepreneurs may be a way to \nsolve the problems of low financial reporting standards as well as other structural \nproblems that plague the SME sector.  \nAs far as regulatory issues are concerned, the recent steps by the government to \npromote consumer protection, de-dollarize the economy, and increase the level of \n29 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 849  Babych, Grigolia, and Keshelava \n \nfinancial  literacy  are  adequate  and  timely.  Policy-makers,  however,  need  to  be \ncautious  about  changes  that  can  affect  both  consumers  and  providers  of \nfinancial services. Financial inclusion is driven by both demand and supply factors  \n\u2013 thus, the efforts to de-dollarize lending to households can also create a higher cost of \nhedging instruments for banks and MFIs, higher domestic currency interest rates, and, \nconsequently, less affordable loans for households.  \nFinally, policy-makers need to stay vigilant and informed about the new financial \ntechnologies  that  appear  on  the  market  that  can  potentially  affect  vulnerable \npopulation  groups.  In  this  respect,  the  recent  changes  in  the  Civil  Code  to  keep \neffective interest rates capped were an adequate response to rapidly growing predatory \nlending practices. Yet, policy-makers need to develop the means to keep an eye on \nvarious segments of the financial market, not just commercial banks or microfinances, \nin order to detect problems before they arise. One of the instruments employed could \nbe  more  frequent  surveys  about  lending,  borrowing,  and  savings  behavior  and \npractices of households and SMEs.  \n   \n30 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 849  Babych, Grigolia, and Keshelava \n \nREFERENCES \nAsian Development Bank (ADB).
