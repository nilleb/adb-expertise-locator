Sound and efficient financial systems \nare especially important for sustaining growth in developing Asia because \nefficiency of investment will overshadow quantity of investment as the driver \nof growth in the region. The data indicate that the region\u2019s financial systems \nhave become deeper and more diversified since the early 1990s. A more formal \neconometric analysis on a panel data of 125 countries confirms that financial \ndevelopment has a significant positive effect on growth, especially in developing \ncountries. The results also indicate that the impact of financial development on \nthe region\u2019s growth is not noticeably different than elsewhere, and the impact \nhas weakened since the Asian financial crisis. Overall, our evidence supports \nthe notion that further development of the financial sector matters for sustaining \ndeveloping Asia\u2019s growth in the postcrisis period. However, the primary role of \nfinancial sector development in growth is likely to shift away from mobilizing \nsavings, thus augmenting the quantity of investment toward improving the \nefficiency of investment, and thereby contributing to higher economywide \nproductivity.\n\n\f\fI. Introduction\n\nWhile there were a number of factors underlying the global financial and economic crisis, \nthe crisis was most immediately the consequence of market failures in the housing and \nfinancial markets in the United States (US). The development of sophisticated financial \nderivatives purportedly allowed for an efficient transfer of risk to those best able to bear it. \nIn practice, however, such instruments can potentially obscure the true magnitude of the \nhuge systemic risk inherent in the financial system arising from massive lending to home \nbuyers with subprime credit ratings. The speed and scope of such financial innovation \noften far outpaced the capacity of the regulatory authorities to keep up. As a result, \nexisting prudential regulation and supervision repeatedly failed to contain excessive \nrisk taking behavior of the market participants. The recent global crisis represents this \ncolossal failure of prudential regulation and supervision. Predictably and understandably, \nthere has been something of a global backlash against financial innovation and finance \nin general in the aftermath of the global crisis. Finance has come to be associated with \ncrisis, credit crunch, and recession, rather than as a lubricant of growth and development.\n\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s financial systems have largely escaped the paralysis experienced by \ntheir counterparts in the European Union (EU) and the US during the global financial \ncrisis. Even during the climax of the crisis, credit flowed more or less normally from \nthe financial system to the real economy. In particular, commercial banks, the bedrock \nof the region\u2019s financial system, continue to provide financing for the region\u2019s firms \nand households. The region was not completely free from financial instability but the \nbouts of instability were intermittent and sporadic rather than systematic and persistent. \nFor example, the Republic of Korea\u2019s financial markets suffered severe turbulence in \nOctober 2008, but they soon regained their footing after the Bank of Korea entered into \nswap deals with the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, and the People\u2019s Bank of \nChina. In fact, the primary impact of the global financial crisis on developing Asia was \nnot financial at all but transmitted through the trade channel, as the recession in the \nindustrialized countries dulled their appetite for the region\u2019s exports. A major explanation \nfor why the region\u2019s financial systems were largely unscathed by the momentous \nupheaval in the global financial markets was that the region\u2019s financial institutions had \nvery low levels of direct and indirect exposure to subprime assets such as mortgage \nbacked securities and collateralized debt obligations. The lack of exposure to toxic assets, \nin turn, is widely believed to have been due to the relative lack of financial sophistication. \n\nAs the global crisis has painfully highlighted, the failure of financial regulatory authorities \nto monitor and control the risks associated with financial innovation can be a major \n\n\f2 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 233\n\nsource of instability for the financial system and the real economy.  Subject to adequate \nprudential supervision, financial innovation can promote the soundness and efficiency of \nfinancial markets. The concept of financial innovation, in the sense of complex, opaque, \nand poorly understood financial instruments associated with the global crisis, should \nnot be equated with the broader and more basic concept of financial development, \nwhich refers to the development of a broad, deep, and liquid financial system that \nefficiently intermediates the economy\u2019s savings into various productive uses, in particular \ninvestment. Indeed, a number of constructive financial innovations developed in the past \nhave substantially eased payment transactions, encouraged savings, helped channel \nsavings into productive investments, and facilitated allocation of financial risks (Litan \n2010). \n\nFinancial systems in developing Asia remain far below industrial-country standards and \nlag substantially behind its dynamic real economy particularly the manufacturing sector, \nwhich is world-class in many parts. This explains why much of the region\u2019s huge pool \nof savings is intermediated by financially more advanced economies outside the region. \nFinancial development for a financially underdeveloped region such as developing Asia \nrefers to the basic business of building up sounder and more efficient banks, equity \nmarkets, and bond markets.\n\nIf financial underdevelopment allowed developing Asia to fortuitously escape the global \nfinancial crisis, the Asian financial crisis of 1997\u20131998 underlines the potentially large \ncosts of financial underdevelopment. A wide range of underlying factors contributed to the \ncrisis, and to this debate, the relative importance of the different factors remains a subject \nof heated controversy. While the reversal of large inflows of volatile short-term foreign \ncapital was the immediate catalyst of the crisis, weak and inefficient financial systems \nthat failed to allocate capital to productive uses lay at the heart of the crisis. Much of \nthe credit flowed into investments that failed to add to the productive capacity of the \neconomy, hence its debt repayment capacity, most notably real estate. The Asian crisis \nwas ultimately the consequence of a gradual deterioration in the quality of investments \nwhich, in turn, resulted from large capital inflows into underdeveloped financial systems \nthat could not allocate them efficiently. For a region that had grown rapidly on the back \nof high investment rates, the Asian crisis served as a sobering view that the quality of \ninvestment matters, and matters a lot.\n\nFortunately, developing Asia has made a great deal of progress in building up a more \nrobust and efficient financial system since the Asian crisis as a result of extensive \npostcrisis reform and restructuring. In particular, the health of Asia\u2019s commercial banks, \nwhich continue to play a dominant role in Asian financial systems, has improved \nmarkedly. This improvement is reflected in the incidence of nonperforming loans, capital \nadequacy ratios, rates of return on assets, and other major performance indicators. \nAccording to Adams (2008), key changes in Asian banking sectors include consolidation \nand rationalization, greater transparency and disclosure, increase in foreign ownership, \n\n\fFinancial Development and Economic Growth in Developing Asia | 3\n\nand decline in state ownership. Asian banks have built up sizable prudential cushions \nas a result of new capital injections, and their balance sheets have generally become \nstronger. They have also moved into new business areas such as investment banking, \nconsumer lending, and real estate, in addition to providing a wider range of financial \nproducts and services. Furthermore, in most countries, the prudential supervision and \nregulation structures have been strengthened, and have become more forwardlooking and \nrisk-based. In addition to the improvement in the health of the banking system, another \npositive recent development in developing Asia\u2019s financial systems has been the rapid \ndevelopment of equity markets, and to a lesser, extent bond markets. A more diverse \nfinancial system that is less dependent on banks is more robust and resilient to shocks. \nMore importantly, vibrant capital markets are the primary source of long-term capital that \nfinances an economy\u2019s long-term investment needs.\n\nSound and efficient financial systems that do a good job of their primary function of \nallocating capital to its most productive uses will be pivotal to sustaining growth beyond \nthe crisis for one simple fundamental reason\u2014developing Asia needs healthy investment \nfor strong medium- and long-term growth. In the past, the primary contribution of the \nfinancial system to the region\u2019s growth has been to mobilize large pools of savings that \nwere then used to finance the region\u2019s plethora of profitable investment opportunities. \nIn the past, developing Asia was a low-income, capital-scarce region with inherently \nhigh marginal returns to capital. Therefore, in the context of growth, the efficiency of \ninvestment was secondary to the quantity of investment as the economies built up their \ncapital stocks from very low initial bases. Rapid growth has transformed developing Asia \ninto a middle-income, capital-abundant region. As a result, the region is in the midst of \na transition from growth based on inputs and factor accumulation, to growth based on \nproductivity growth (Park and Park 2010). Therefore, the primary role of the financial \nsystem in the region\u2019s growth is likely to change from that of mobilizing savings and \nboosting the quantity of investment to fostering productivity growth by enhancing the \nefficiency of investment. Such a role requires deeper, broader, and more liquid financial \nsystems that move the region closer toward the frontier of global finance. Expanding \nfinancial access to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and would-be entrepreneurs is \nvital for dynamic efficiency in which new products, services, and industries bring about \nstructural change and deliver large welfare gains over time. Expanded access also \nfacilitates the entry of new producers into the market and thereby stimulates a competitive \nenvironment conducive for productivity growth.\n\nThe primary role of the financial system in developing Asia\u2019s economic growth in the \npostglobal crisis period will thus be to improve the efficiency of investment, thereby \ncontributing to productivity growth. The underlying rationale is the region\u2019s broader \ntransition from accumulation-led growth to productivity-led growth. In addition to this \nstructural shift in developing Asia\u2019s growth process, there are also a number of other \nfactors that suggest a key role for a sound and efficient financial system in sustaining \nthe region\u2019s growth beyond the global crisis. For one, reducing excessive dependence \n\n\f4 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 233\n\non extraregional markets and rebalancing growth toward domestic sources has \nemerged as a key structural challenge confronting the region. Financial development \ncan promote rebalancing by stimulating domestic consumption on the demand side \nand service industries catering to domestic demand on the supply side. One medium-\nterm rationale for strengthening the financial systems is the prospect of large capital \ninflows attracted to the region\u2019s stronger growth prospects, and higher interest rates \nvis-\u00e0-vis the industrialized countries. While capital controls are one way to deal with \ncapital inflows, a more fundamental solution lies in increasing the absorptive capacity \nof the financial system. A long-term rationale for sounder and more efficient financial \nsystems is the region\u2019s rapid population ageing, which will reduce aggregate savings in \nthe future. Again, this points to a growing need to improve the efficiency of investment. \nFinancial development will also allow the region\u2019s financial institutions to play a greater \nrole in intermediating the region\u2019s large pool of net savings accumulated from past \nexternal surpluses. Currently, the vast majority of those savings are intermediated by the \ngovernment in the form of foreign exchange reserves.\n\nII. Does Financial Development Promote Growth? \nTheory and Evidence\n\nIn this section, we review the main theoretical rationales for a positive effect of financial \ndevelopment on economic growth and provide a brief overview of the large and growing \nempirical literature that investigates the financial development\u2013growth nexus.\n\nA.  \n\nFinancial Development and Growth: Theory\n\nA financial system consists of financial institutions\u2014e.g., commercial banks\u2014and \nfinancial markets\u2014e.g., stock and bond markets. At a broader level, a robust and efficient \nfinancial system promotes growth by channeling resources to their most productive uses \nand fostering a more efficient allocation of resources. A stronger and better financial \nsystem can also lift growth by boosting the aggregate savings rate and investment \nrate, speeding up the accumulation of physical capital. Financial development also \npromotes growth by strengthening competition and stimulating innovative activities that \nfoster dynamic efficiency. According to Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt and Levine (2008), the overall \nfunction of a financial system is to reduce information and transactions costs impeding \neconomic activity, and its five core functions are to (i) produce ex ante information \nabout possible investments and allocate capital; (ii) monitor investments and provide \ncorporate governance after providing finance; (iii) facilitate the trading, diversification and \nmanagement of risk; (iv) mobilize and pool savings; and (v) ease the exchange of goods \nand services. The efficiency of a financial system refers to how well a financial system \nperforms the five core functions and financial development refers to an improvement \n\n\fFinancial Development and Economic Growth in Developing Asia | 5\n\nin the efficiency of a financial system. Let us now elaborate upon each of the five \ncore functions so as to gain a clearer understanding of the nexus between financial \ndevelopment and economic growth.\n\nFirst and foremost, financial systems produce information and allocate capital. The \ntextbook world of scarce capital seamlessly flowing to the most productive firms and \nindustries is a world that assumes away information costs. The intermediation of savings \ninto investments depends on the quality and quantity of information available to individual \nsavers, but it may be too costly individual savers to acquire information on their own. \nFinancial intermediaries such as banks collect, process, and produce information on \npossible investments more efficiently than individual savers. Armed with more and better \ninformation, financial intermediaries will invest in more promising firms and industries. \nThe economywide effect is a more efficient allocation of capital that directs capital toward \nthe more productive producers and away from the less productive producers. Financial \nintermediaries can also stimulate innovation by identifying the most promising new \ntechnologies and products. Large and liquid stock markets also encourage the acquisition \nof information by making firm-specific information more profitable.\n\nSecond, financial systems monitor firm behavior and exert corporate governance. To \nthe extent that shareholders and creditors in a firm can effectively monitor and influence \nhow the managers of the firm use the funds they provided, i.e., exercise corporate \ngovernance, they will have greater incentive to provide the funds in the first place. \nEffective corporate governance keeps managers on their toes and encourages them to \nuse capital in ways that maximize profits and firm value. More efficient management at \nthe firm level results in a more efficient allocation of resources for the economy as a \nwhole. Large information and transactions costs mean that small individual shareholders \nand creditors do not have the incentive to engage in monitoring manager behavior. \nOn the other hand, larger investors such as financial intermediaries face stronger \nincentives to monitor and have greater influence over managers. By improving corporate \ngovernance, financial intermediaries can have a positive effect on growth. Stock markets \ncan also serve as a powerful for aligning the interests of firm mangers with those of firm \nowners. \n\nThird, financial instruments, intermediaries, and markets can facilitate the trading, \nhedging, and pooling of risk. By enabling risk diversification across firms and industries, \nfinancial systems can influence the allocation of resources and hence economic growth. \nWhile individuals are generally averse to risk, high-return investment opportunities tend \nto be high-risk. By allowing individuals to diversify their risk, financial intermediaries and \nmarkets divert more capital to high-risk, high-return investment projects and thereby \nboost the overall productivity of capital. Risk diversification also has a positive impact on \ninnovative activity since risk-averse savers are more likely to invest in a portfolio of new \ntechnologies and products than a single new technology or product. Financial markets \nand intermediaries also mitigate liquidity risk, and thereby induce savers to invest in \n\n\f6 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 233\n\nhigh-return projects requiring a long-term commitment of capital. Highly liquid markets \nfor stocks, bonds, and demand deposits transform these financial instruments into \ninvestments and into high-return, long-term projects.\n\nFourth, financial systems pool or mobilize savings from different savers for investment. \nThe mobilization of savings involves collecting savings from a large number of individuals \ninto collectively large amounts that can finance even very large investment projects. Both \nfinancial intermediaries and financial markets can perform this function. Financial systems \nthat are better able to mobilize savings create a larger pool of savings that lead to higher \naggregate investment, faster rate of capital accumulation, and hence faster economic \ngrowth. Given that one of the hallmarks of developing Asia\u2019s economic success was its \nhigh saving and investment rates, this core function has been important for the region\u2019s \ngrowth in the past. More generally, the mobilization of savings for investment matters \nmore for low-income, capital-scarce economies, which typically enjoy higher marginal \nreturns to capital. The high relative importance of the savings mobilizing function of \nfinancial systems at low income levels mirrors the high relative importance of quantitative \ncapital accumulation in the early stages of the growth process.\n\nFifth, at a more fundamental level, financial instruments, intermediaries, and markets \ncan stimulate specialization, innovation, and growth by reducing transactions costs. The \ntransition from barter economy to a monetary economy brings about a quantum leap \nin efficiency and welfare as a result of the three basic functions of money\u2014means of \npayment, unit of account, and store. By reducing the transactions costs of economic \nexchange and activity, money enables workers to specialize in specific activities. Greater \nspecialization, in turn, improves the capacity of workers to create new technologies and \nproducts. The end result of increased specialization and innovation is faster economic \ngrowth. The decline in transactions costs does not stop with the introduction of money but \nwill continue as long as there is financial innovation. Credit cards and automated teller \nmachines are but two examples of financial innovation that have cut transactions costs. \nFinancial innovation that reduces the cost of economic exchange and activity will spur \nfurther specialization and innovation and thereby contribute to growth.\n\nIn the case of developing countries, including developing Asia, stability or lack thereof of \nthe financial system is another channel through which financial development influences \ngrowth. A sound financial system is characterized by healthy financial institutions \nand smooth, well-functioning financial markets, which jointly allow for robustness and \nresilience in the face of adverse shocks. For example, as noted earlier, the balance \nsheets of developing Asia\u2019s banks have become markedly stronger since the Asian crisis \nas a result of consolidation, recapitalization, and more generally, restructuring and reform. \nLikewise, sound equity and bond markets are markets with enough size, breadth, depth, \nliquidity, and sophistication so that their movements are broadly in line with fundamentals \nrather than subject to excessive noise and volatility. An effective prudential regulatory and \nsupervisory framework, along with the risk management capacity of banks and sound \n\n\fFinancial Development and Economic Growth in Developing Asia | 7\n\nmarket infrastructure of the bond and equity markets, holds the key to ensuring stability \nof the financial sector. Developing Asia would have suffered a much steeper decline \nin growth had it suffered the same level of financial instability experienced by the EU \nand the US during the global financial crisis. Furthermore, during the Asian crisis many \ncountries in the region were firsthand witnesses to the devastating impact of financial \ninstability on the real economy. Therefore, in the context of fostering growth, an integral \ncomponent of developing Asia\u2019s financial development must be to build up robust and \nresilient financial systems capable of withstanding even large shocks.\n\nAnother dimension of financial development that has a special resonance for developing \nAsia and other developing countries is access to financial services. Relative to \nindustrialized countries, the access of firms and households in those countries remains \nlimited. Lack of access to finance can be a serious barrier to investment and business \nactivity in general. In particular, lack of new financing often impedes setting up new \nbusinesses essential to a dynamic economy. New firms are especially important in \nknowledge-based industries that will grow in significance as the region\u2019s economies \nmature. More generally, entrepreneurship is essential for a vibrant private sector that \nconstantly renews itself and creates new firms, industries, and jobs, for which access \nto finance is the indispensable lubricant for entrepreneurship. Adequate financing for \nSMEs, which tend to predominate in the services sector, will help revitalize the region\u2019s \nservices sector that has lagged its manufacturing sector for a long time. Access to \nfinance, whether through mainstream financial institutions or through microfinance and \nother specialized institutions, can expand the opportunities for poorer households to \nengage in productive activities. For example, rural finance can provide rural households \nwith the money to buy high-yield seeds, fertilizers, and farming equipment. Just as \nimportantly, access to finance confers substantial welfare gains for poorer households by, \nfor example, allowing them to smooth their lifetime consumption and coping with negative \nshocks. Therefore, access to finance can contribute to narrow economic growth as well \nas broader social development. \n\nB.  \n\nFinancial Development and Growth: Evidence\n\nEconomic theory and intuition suggest a number of plausible channels through which \nfinancial development can have a positive effect on economic growth. Predictably, a \nlarge and growing empirical literature has sprung up to examine the relationship between \nfinance and growth. At a broader level, the literature looks at the impact on gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth of (i) the depth of the financial system, as measured by \nindicators such as the ratio of total liquid liabilities to GDP, the ratio of bank credit to GDP, \nor the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP; and (ii) the structure of the financial \nsystem, as measured by indicators such as the ratio of bank credit to stock market \ncapitalization. The balance of evidence from the empirical literature strongly indicates that \nfinancial depth has a significant positive effect on growth whereas financial structure (the \nrelative weight of banks versus capital markets) does not have any appreciable effect \n\n\f8 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 233\n\non growth. More specifically, bank development and stock market development exerts a \nsignificant positive effect on growth, as does overall financial development. Although a \nshift from banks to capital markets is often viewed as evidence of financial development, \ncountries with market-based financial systems do not perform better than those with \nbank-based systems. Therefore, the broader finding from the empirical literature is that \nwhat matters for economic performance is overall financial development rather than the \nrelative weight of its various components.\n\nIn a comprehensive review of the empirical literature, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt and Levine (2008) \npoint out that the literature contains four different types of studies: (i) pure cross-country \ngrowth regressions, (ii) panel techniques that make use of both the cross-country and \ntime-series dimensions of the data, (iii) microeconomic studies that explore the various \nchannels through which finance may affect economic growth, and (iv) individual country \ncase studies. The first approach involves the application of broad cross-country growth \nregressions, which seek to explain growth through standard explanatory variables such \nas physical and human capital, to the study of finance and growth. These studies typically \naggregate growth over long periods of time and examine the relationship between \nlong-run growth and various measures of financial development. The second approach \ninvolves the analysis of panel data and seeks to mitigate some of the econometric \nproblems associated with the pure cross-country approach. The second approach has \na number of well-known advantages vis-\u00e0-vis the first approach even though it also \nsuffers from some disadvantages. The third approach uses firm-level and industry-level \ndata to assess the impact of financial development on firm and industry performance. A \npositive impact would lend support to the notion that financial development is beneficial \nfor growth. The fourth country drops the cross-country dimension and looks at the finance \ngrowth in a single individual country. For example, some studies analyze the impact of a \nspecific policy change in a country.\n\nWe now discuss in more detail the literature on cross-country growth regressions, \nincluding those that use panel techniques, since this is the approach we use for our \nown empirical analysis. Empirical assessment of the relationship between growth and \nfinancial development involves a wide range of econometric techniques and data sets. In \nthe earlier cross-country regression studies, economic growth is usually averaged over \nlong periods while financial indicators are either averaged over the same period or taken \nfrom the initial year. In addition, a number of macroeconomic indicators are used as \ncontrol variables. A pioneering early study in King and Levine (1993), who examine the \nrelationship between financial depth, as measured by liquid liabilities, and three growth \nmeasures, namely, real per capita GDP growth, real per capita capital stock growth, and \ntotal productivity growth, all averaged over the sample period. Using data for 77 countries \nover the period 1960\u20131989, King and Levine find a statistically significant positive \nrelationship between financial depth and the three growth measures.\n\n\fFinancial Development and Economic Growth in Developing Asia | 9\n\nCross-country regression has also been employed to examine individual effects of banks \nand nonbank financial institutions on growth. The study by Levine and Zervos (1998) find \nthe initial level of banking development and stock market activity as having statistically \nsignificant relationships with average output growth, capital stock growth, and productivity \ngrowth, based on data for 47 countries over the period 1976\u20131993. They also perform \ncontemporaneous regressions, which use dependent and independent variables averaged \nover the same period, and these yield similar results. They use bank credit to the private \nsector as measure of banking development. For stock market development, they use \nturnover ratio and value traded to represent stock market liquidity, and stock market \ncapitalization to measure size of the equity market. Stock market liquidity measures are \nfound to be robust predictors of future economic growth but stock market size is not. \nIn addition, the results of stock market size regression are strongly influenced by a few \ncountries. \n\nBeck and Levine (2004) apply panel econometric techniques along with new data to \nre-examine the relationship between stock markets, banks, and economic growth. They \nexamine whether measures of stock market and bank development each have a positive \nrelationship with economic growth after controlling for simultaneity bias and omitted \nvariable bias. They use data for 40 countries, averaged over 5 years from 1976 to 1998, \nand employ generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators for panel data analysis. \nBoth stock markets and banks are found to be jointly significant in affecting economic \ngrowth in their panel estimation, thus suggesting that stock markets provide different \nfinancial services from banks.\n\nThe study by Levine, Loayza, and Beck (2000) likewise implement GMM panel estimators \nto analyze the link between financial development and growth. In addition, they \ncomplement this with a cross-country instrumental variable regression. For the panel \nestimation, data are averaged over each of the seven 5-year intervals over the period \n1960\u20131995 for 74 countries. In the instrumental variable regression, legal origin is used \nas instrument on the premise that this has an influence on national policies related to the \nefficiency of the financial sector. Levine et al. conclude that the significant link between \nfinancial intermediary development and economic growth is not due to potential biases \ninduced by omitted variables, simultaneity, or reverse causation. Regardless of the \neconometric techniques and data set employed, a growing body of evidence indicates \nthat financial development is important for growth.\n\nWhile various econometric techniques have been developed to more rigorously \ninvestigate the relationship between financial development and growth, weaknesses \nin measures of financial development remain. Ideally, financial development indicators \nshould be able to measure how well the financial system addresses information \nasymmetries, reduces transactions costs, mobilizes resources, and manages risk since \nthese are the direct mechanisms through which financial development promotes growth. \nTraditional indicators of financial depth such as the ratio of bank credit to GDP are at \nbest highly imperfect measures of how well the financial system performs such growth-\n\n\f10 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 233\n\npromoting services. Unfortunately, as of now, no indicator is able to adequately capture \nthese financial services, so empirical studies, including our own, rely on traditional \nmeasures of financial development (Rajan and Zingales 1998, Levine and Zervos 1998, \nand Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt and Levine 2008).\n\nIII. Developing Asia\u2019s Financial Development:  \nSome Stylized Facts\n\nIn this section, we explore some stylized facts of financial development in developing \nAsia. More specifically, we first compare the financial depth of developing Asian countries \nwith that of countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \n(OECD). We then look at traditional indicators of financial depth such as bank credit to \nGDP ratio and traditional indicators of financial structure such as the ratio of bank credit \nto stock market capitalization, across subregions and over time. We then compare how \nsome major developing Asian countries compare to the industrialized in terms of financial \naccess. Finally, we examine the correlation between financial development and economic \ngrowth in developing Asia, and how the correlation may have changed since the Asian \ncrisis.\n\nA.  \n\nComparison of Financial Depth in Developing Asia versus OECD\n\nThere is a widespread perception that developing Asia\u2019s financial systems substantially \nlag its real economy despite a great deal of progress in recent years. An equally popular \nperception is that the region remains financially underdeveloped relative to industrialized \ncountries. Figure 1, which compares the financial development of some major developing \nAsian countries with that of OECD, provides an informal examination of those views. \nBank lending as a proportion of GDP in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and the \nPhilippines is less than one half that in the OECD economies, but the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) and Thailand are already closing in the gap. The disparity with OECD \nis likewise evident in capital markets. While stock markets have recently been gaining \nground in developing Asia, they are still way below that of OECD, especially in the case \nof Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Pakistan. An exceptional case is India, whose stock \nmarket capitalization dramatically shot up after 2002 to reach about 170% of GDP in \n2008, surpassing the average OECD figure. The gap with OECD is more pronounced in \nbond markets. Only recently have bond markets expanded rapidly, and these are due to \nofficial measures undertaken to develop local currency bond markets, including regional \nefforts such as the Asian Bond Markets Initiatives and the Asian Bond Funds. Despite the \nexpansion, Asian local currency bond markets remain underdeveloped.\n\n\fFinancial Development and Economic Growth in Developing Asia | 11\n\nFigure 1: Financial Depth, Selected Asian Countries and High-Income OECD Countries, \n2008 (percent of GDP)\n\nOverall Financial Markets and Banks\n\n \n\n180\n\n135\n\n90\n\n45\n\n0\n\n180\n\n135\n\n90\n\n45\n\n0\n\nPRC\n\nBAN\n\nIND\n\nINO\n\nPAK\n\nPHI\n\nTHA\n\nOECD\n\nLiquid Liabilities \n\nPrivate Credit\n\nCapital Markets \n\nPRC\n\nBAN\n\nIND\n\nINO\n\nPAK\n\nPHI\n\nTHA\n\nOECD\n\nStock Market\n\nBond Market\n\nGDP = gross domestic product, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, BAN = Bangladesh, IND = India,   \nINO = Indonesia, PAK = Pakistan, PHI = Philippines, THA = Thailand, OECD = Organisation  \nfor Economic Co-operation and Development.\nNote:   Data on stock market and bond market refer to total market capitalization.  \n\nHigh-income OECD excludes the Republic of Korea, Poland, and Slovenia.\n\nSources: Authors' estimates; Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Levine (2010); CEIC Data Company (accessed 30 June 2010).\n\nB.  \n\nFinancial Depth, Breadth, and Access in Developing Asia\n\nFinancial depth provides a measure of the size of the financial system relative to size of \nthe economy (or GDP).  Financial breadth is a gauge of the relative importance of banks \nrelative to capital markets (i.e., equities and bonds), and thus provides an indication if \na financial system has diversified from primarily banking services toward greater use of \ncapital markets. Indicators for both depth and breadth are available for a large number \nof countries across several years in the Financial Development and Structure Database \nof Beck et al. (2010).  As Figures 2, 3, and 4 show, owing to the expansion of both the \nbanking sector and capital markets, aggregate financial depth in the region has increased \nsince the 1990s. Growth in private credit was clearly on a rising trend in the 1990s but \nbegan to soften after the 1997\u20131998 Asian financial crisis. Capital markets (stock and \n\n\f12 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 233\n\nbond markets) have grown rapidly in recent years. Across the region, there is some \nvariation in the extent by which the banking sector and capital markets have performed.\n\nFigure 2: Private Credit (percent of GDP)\n\n120\n\n90\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\n270\n\n180\n\n90\n\n0\n\n1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008\n\nCentral Asia\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\nEast Asia\n\nThe Pacific\n\nSouth Asia\n\nGDP = gross domestic product.\nNote:   Central Asia consists of Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and the Kyrgyz Republic. \nEast Asia covers the People\u2019s Republic of China; Hong Kong, China; the Republic \nof Korea; and Taipei,China.

There was no almost \ndiscernible change in bank credit in this subregion, yet the total size of its equity and \nbond markets have increased twofold in the postcrisis, driving the growth in overall \nfinancial depth. In South Asia, both the banking sector and capital markets have been \nimportant in the deepening of the financial sector. Undoubtedly, the rising financial depth \nin South Asia is primarily driven by India, where strong economic growth has been \naccompanied by marked improvements in bank lending and equity markets. Central Asia \nand the Pacific have also witnessed deepening, albeit modest, in their financial markets. \nStill, the financial sectors in these subregions are dominated by the banking sector. \nWhile equity markets are present in some economies in Central Asia, on average they \naccount for less than 20% of GDP, a far cry from the levels in the rest of the region. In \ncontrast to other subregions, the size of the financial sector in East Asia has remained \n\n\f14 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 233\n\nunchanged since the Asian financial crisis\u2014its aggregate financial depth was quite high in \nthe mid-1990s at over 200% of GDP, and this was somewhat maintained throughout the \npostcrisis. In the case of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand, bank credit \ngradually rose in the 1990s and reached their peak levels in 1997\u20131998, before steadily \nfalling. By 2008, banking loans in these countries were just about one half of what they \nwere from their peak levels.  The ensuing decline in bank lending after the Asian financial \ncrisis may be viewed as a correction of the excesses in lending prior to the crisis. Banks \nhave also become better at managing their risks since the financial crisis, and hence \nhave reduced their lending.\n\nAlongside a deepening of its financial markets, the region has witnessed changes in \nits financial structure, as seen in the strengthening of capital markets relative to bank \ncredit. Figure 5 indicates that the ratios of total capital markets\u2014sum of stock market \ncapitalization and bond market capitalization\u2014to bank credit have increased for most \ncountries in East Asia and Southeast Asia, and in India in the postcrisis. For countries \nsuch as India, the Republic of Korea, and Viet Nam, the increases in the ratio of capital \nmarkets to bank credit have been due to bigger increases in capital markets relative to \nexpansion of bank lending. For the PRC and Taipei,China, the ratio of capital markets to \nbank credit rose mainly because of the upturn in capital markets; their bank credit was \nalmost unchanged in the postcrisis. But for Hong Kong, China and most countries in \nSoutheast Asia, the ratio of capital markets to bank credit has risen due to increases in \ncapital markets amid declines in bank credit. \n\nWhile both equity and bond markets have improved across countries in the region, it \nis the growing equity markets that have largely contributed to the rising importance of \ncapital markets relative to bank credit. For example, in East Asia, the ratio of its stock \nmarket to bank credit increased to 2 in 2008, roughly double its ratio in 2000. In contrast, \nthe ratio of its bond market to bank credit rose to just 0.51 from 0.34 in the same period. \nOverall, trends indicate that the region appears to be moving toward a more broad-based \nfinancial system. While the pace of financial deepening has tended to slow across much \nof the region, financial broadening has strengthened (see Adams 2008). While equity \nmarkets have steadily risen, still much needs to be done in developing the region\u2019s \nlagging bond market. Bank lending has also remained restrained, reinforcing the need to \nstrengthen and diversify the region\u2019s financial system.\n\nBroad access of financial services is important for a number of reasons. It is important \nfor poverty reduction, since constraints in financial services have prevented the poor or \nthose with no collateral from engaging in profitable businesses. Limited access to finance \nalso prevents the entry of new and innovative firms incapable of self-financing.  Access \nto financing has important effects on how technology and new knowledge are developed, \nas availability of financing provides an incentive to think creatively (see Beck et al. 2007). \nThere is not much evidence linking financial access to development outcomes because \nof lack of data (World Bank 2008). There are limited surveys that collect information on \naccess of households or firms. In the absence of data that directly measure access, \ncrude indicators that relate to geographic access or the use of financial services have \nrecently been used in the literature.\n\n\fFinancial Development and Economic Growth in Developing Asia | 15\n\nFigure 5: Ratio of Capital Markets to Private Credit (percent of GDP)\n\nEast Asia and India\n\n150\n\n120\n\n90\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\n150\n\n120\n\n90\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\n1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008\n\nEast Asia\nKorea, Rep. of \n\nChina, People's Rep. of \nTaipei,China\n\nHong Kong, China\nIndia\n\nSoutheast Asia \n\n1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004\n\n2006 2008\n\nSoutheast Asia\nPhilippines\n\nIndonesia\nSingapore\n\nMalaysia\nThailand\n\nNote: \nSource:  See Figure 1.\n\nCapital markets refer to the sum of stock market capitalization and bond market capitalization.\n\nFigure 6 shows that financial access, measured by bank branches and ATMs per \n100,000 people, varies substantially across selected developing Asian countries. Overall, \nfinancial access in these countries is also more difficult compared to OECD, which \nagain supports the notion that the region is financially underdeveloped. Firms surveyed \nby the World Bank\u2019s Enterprise Surveys (World Bank, various years) consider access \nto financing as a major constraint. Small and medium enterprises also tend to find \naccess to financing more difficult compared to large firms, and this was evident in firms \nsurveyed in Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and \nViet Nam. Across countries, survey data also indicate that less than 20% of small firms \nsurveyed use external finance, about half the rate of large firms (World Bank 2008). While \nphysical access prevents some SMEs from access financial services, limited assets or \nlack of collateral and documentary requirements for bank lending are additional barriers. \nDeveloping more competitive banking systems may improve access of SMEs to financial \nservices.\n\n\f16 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 233\n\nFigure 6: Access to Banking Services, Selected Asian Countries  \nversus High-income OECD Countries, 2008\n\nBranches per \n100,000 People\n\nATMs per 100,000 \nPeople\n90\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\nPRC \n\nBAN\n\nIND\n\nINO\n\nPAK\n\nPHI\n\nTHA\n\nOECD\n\nNumber of branches per 100,000 people\nNumber of ATMs per 100,000 people \n\nATM = automated teller machine, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, BAN = Bangladesh, IND = India,   \nINO = Indonesia, PAK = Pakistan, PHI = Philippines, THA = Thailand, OECD = Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development. \n\n \nNote:   Data for the PRC are based on the 2003/2004 survey by Beck et al.

Economic theory suggests that more robust and efficient financial systems \nwill have a positive effect on growth, and hence a positive relationship between the \ntwo variables. Figure 7 indicates the presence of a positive relationship for developing \nAsia in the 1990s, but the relationship has weakened after the crisis. Figure 8 shows \nthe correlations between growth and three measures of financial development: liquid \nliabilities, private credit, and stock market capitalization, all as a percentage of GDP. The \ncorrelations were positive in 1990\u20131997, although a weaker relationship was observed \nbetween growth and stock market development. In the postcrisis, the correlations \nhave turned very weak or even negative. This does not necessarily indicate that the \ncontribution of financial development to economic growth has weakened in the postcrisis \nperiod. Instead the more likely explanation for the weaker correlation is that countries \nin the region, especially those affected by the Asian crisis, have made adjustments to \ncorrect the overinvestment and overlending immediately prior to that crisis. Better risk \nmanagement by banks and more accurate pricing of risk signal financial development, \nnotwithstanding the stagnation or reduction of bank credit.\n\n\fFinancial Development and Economic Growth in Developing Asia | 17\n\nFigure 7: Growth and Financial Development, Selected Developing Asian Economies\n\na.

Overall Summary of Stylized Facts\n\nOur brief review of the main stylized features of developing Asia\u2019s financial systems by \nand large confirms much of the conventional wisdom. The region remains financially \nunderdeveloped relative to the industrialized countries despite marked progress in its \nfinancial development in recent years, especially since the Asian crisis. In particular, the \nregion\u2019s bond markets remain underdeveloped relative to its banks and equity markets. \nRelated to this, access to financial services, an important but often overlooked aspect of \nfinancial development, in the region also lags the industrialized countries. The region has \nexperienced substantial financial deepening and this deepening has been driven primarily \nby expansion of the capital markets, in particular equity markets. In contrast to the fast-\ngrowing capital markets, bank credit has remained subdued since the Asian crisis and \nthis probably reflects, at least to some extent, the correction of excesses in the precrisis \nperiod. For the same reason, the correlation between financial development and growth \nhas weakened markedly since the Asian crisis.\n\nIV. Empirical Analysis of the Finance\u2013Growth \nRelationship\n\nIn this section, we describe the data and econometric methodology we use to investigate \nthe relationship between financial development and economic growth, and report and \ndiscuss the main findings emerging from our analysis. Broadly speaking, our methodology \nclosely follows the cross-country growth regressions strand of the existing empirical \n\n\fFinancial Development and Economic Growth in Developing Asia | 19\n\nliterature on finance and growth, except that we use panel data and estimation techniques \nsuitable for such data. This strand of the literature is based on the regression of economic \ngrowth on indicators of financial development as well as a number of control variables \naffecting growth. A positive and significant effect of the financial development indicators \nwould lend empirical support to a beneficial role of finance in growth. In addition to output \ngrowth, we also explore the impact of financial development on total factor productivity \n(TFP) growth, the measure of productivity growth. Further, we also explore whether there \nhas been a change in the impact of finance in Asian countries before and after the Asian \nfinancial crisis; whether the impact differs for developing versus industrialized countries; \nand finally, whether the impact differs for developing Asian countries. Our empirical \nanalysis will help to shed some light on the critical issue of whether finance matters for \ngrowth.\n\nA.   Model and Data\n\n \n\n \n\nFollowing the general approach in the literature, this study applies econometric \ntechniques to examine the relationship between financial development and growth.  The \nbasic structure of the econometric model closely follows empirical models tested in the \nliterature (for example, King and Levine 1993): \n\nx\n\n,\ni t\n\n=\n\n+ [\n\u03b1 \u03b2\n\nFD\n\n] + [\n\u03bb\n\n,\ni t\n\nOther\n\n] +\n\n,\ni t\n\n\u03b5\ni t\n,\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n (1)\n\nwhere a number of financial sector development [FD] indicators and a number of \nnonfinancial control variables [Other] are assumed to affect economic growth or TFP \ngrowth (x).\n\nFor measures of economic growth, the paper uses a series of nonoverlapping 5-years \naverage of GDP per capita growth for each of the sample countries. The TFP growth is \ntaken from Park and Park (2010), which derives TFP data from a neoclassical production \nfunction that takes into account adjustments in human capital. By incorporating average \nyears of schooling (h) from Barro and Lee (2010) to augment labor, the production \nfunction then becomes:\n\nY AK\n=\n\n\u22121 \u03b1\n\n(\nhLL\n\n\u03b1\n)\nL\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n (2)\n\nwhere Y is GDP, K is the capital stock, L is labor, and A is a measure of the state of \ntechnology used in the production process that represents TFP. As is the case for the \ngrowth regression, TFP growth is also represented by a nonoverlapping 5-year average of \neach of the sample.\n\nThere are three indicators of financial development used in this study: \n\n\f20 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 233\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nTotal liquid liabilities relative to GDP, which measures the relative size of \noverall financial depth consisting of currency plus demand and interest-\nbearing liabilities of banks and nonbank financial intermediaries. This is the \nbroadest measure of the financial intermediation activity since it covers all \nbanks, central banks, or nonfinancial intermediary activities. \n\nPrivate credit by deposit money banks relative to GDP. This measure \nisolates only the impact of the banking sector.\n\nStock market capitalization relative to GDP, which gauges the relative size \nof equity market in an economy. \n\nAll three indicators are obtained from Beck et al. (2010). In addition, some of our \nregressions also include an indicator of financial openness, namely capital inflows relative \nto GDP, which measure the relative size of the total direct investment and portfolio \ninvestment in an economy. This indicator is computed from the International Financial \nStatistics online database.\n\nThe full sample of the GDP per capita growth regression is a cross-country panel data \nset covering 116 economies (of which 22 are ADB members) with four nonoverlapping \n5-year periods from 1987 to  2008. In all regressions, data for 1997\u20131998 were dropped \nto take out undue influence of the Asian financial crisis. The 5-year periods correspond \nto 1987\u20131991, 1992\u20131996, 1999\u20132003, and 2004\u20132008. Due to data constraints, not all \neconomies have four observations each, hence, the full sample in the GDP per capita \ngrowth regression is an unbalanced panel of 385 observations. For the TFP regressions, \ndata are only until 2007 since TFP estimates are available only until that year. A total of \n111 economies with 363 observations are included in the full unbalanced sample of TFP \nregressions. Given data limitations, regressions involving stock market data have reduced \nobservations. (See Appendix 1 for the list of economies and the corresponding number of \nobservations included in the regressions.)\n\nA number of control variables are included to control for other factors affecting growth \n(representing [Other] in the above behavioral equation). The choice of these variables \nclosely follows those used in many growth regression analyses done previously (Levine \net al. 2000). Initial GDP per capita from the World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators \nonline database is included to account for growth convergence effect. Years of schooling \nfrom Barro and Lee (2010) is included to represent of human capital accumulation on \ngrowth. The model also controls for quality of governance by including the executive \nconstraint indicator from Polity IV (Marshall and Jaggers 2009), which measures the \nextent of institutionalized constraints on the decision-making powers of chief executives. \nOther standard growth determinants controlled for are relative trade openness, inflation, \nand government consumption, all taken from the World Bank\u2019s World Development \nIndicators online database. The above control variables were averaged for each 5-year \n\n\fFinancial Development and Economic Growth in Developing Asia | 21\n\nperiod, except for the initial GDP per capita, which is taken as the value at t\u20135. In the \nTFP regression, initial TFP is controlled for instead of GDP per capita (see Appendix 2 for \nthe variable description). \n\nTo examine possible differences in how financial sector development affects growth in \nGDP and TFP, the study considers several specifications. The baseline model includes \nall control variables except financial openness. The other models also incorporate dummy \nvariables, interacted with financial indicators, to examine differential effects of post-Asian \nfinancial crisis years, levels of development, and exchange rate regimes. The post-Asian \nfinancial crisis dummy variable takes on a value of 1 for ADB members after 1999, and \n0 otherwise. The level of development dummy is based on the World Bank classification \nand takes on a value of 1 for those not classified as high income OECD or non-OECD. \nFinally, a \u201cdmc\u201d dummy, interacted with financial indicators, is also added to differentiate \nbetween coefficients of ADB members and those of non-ADB members.\n\nB.  \n\nEmpirical Results\n\nIn this section, we report and discuss the results of our regressions. The results from the \nbaseline per capita GDP growth regressions which try to explain per capita GDP growth \nwith financial development indicators and control variables are presented in Tables 1\u20133. \nThe baseline models do not include financial openness as an explanatory variable. The \nfinancial development indicators are total liquid liabilities for Table 1, bank credit for Table \n2, and stock market capitalization for Table 3. Table 4 includes both bank credit and \nstock market capitalization as separate explanatory variables. We use the fixed effects \napproach to account for the unobserved heterogeneity of the countries in the sample. \nFixed effects models essentially account for the country-specific characteristics of the \nsample. The data is transformed by removing the individual country average elements \nfrom each of the variables used in the regression to wash out its country specific \ncharacteristics. Therefore, we exploit both the within-country and time variations of the \ndata to estimate the regression parameters. In general, our results are sensible and \nconsistent with economic intuition as well as the findings of the empirical literature.\n\n\f22 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 233\n\nTable 1:

coefficients are relatively stable over different specifications used in the \nregression analysis. Initial per capita GDP is found to have negative and significant effect \non the growth of GDP per capita, indicating conditional convergence in terms of growth \nwithin the sample countries. Inflation and government size affect growth negatively, \nsuggesting that macroeconomic instability and a relative small private sector are harmful \nfor medium- to long-term growth. Education and trade have the expected significant and \npositive signs. However, the quality of governance indicator is found to be insignificant for \nmedium- to long-term growth. This may reflect the inadequacy of executive constraint as \na measure of governance, or at least governance that matters the most for growth. These \nresults are robust over alternative regression specifications.\n\nOur key variables of interest are the financial development indicators since the central \nquestion of our empirical analysis is the impact of financial development on growth. \nAll the financial indicators are found to have a positive and significant effect on per \ncapita GDP growth. Furthermore, the estimated magnitudes of the parameters tend to \nbe stable across different model specifications and are within the range of parameter \nestimates found in previous studies. This finding is encouraging since it indicates the \nrobustness of our estimated parameters, and hence, a lower risk that our estimates are \nbiased.1 Liquid liabilities, the broadest measure of financial depth, show strong positive \nand significant impact on growth.2 The effects of two alternative measures of financial \ndevelopment, bank credit and stock market capitalization, are also both consistently \npositive and significant. Overall, our evidence is very much in line with the empirical \nliterature, which suggests that financial sector development measured by financial depth \nplays an important role in growth. Our results also suggest that both the banking sector \nand capital markets are beneficial for both. Even when both bank credit and stock market \ncapitalization are included as explanatory variables, they remain positive and significant. \nThe results thus imply that it is overall financial development rather than financial \nstructure or the relative weight of banks versus capital markets that matters for growth. \nConsequently, policy makers should prioritize their efforts on deepening the financial \nsystem as a whole instead of achieving better balance between its different components.\n\nIs the effect of financial development different for countries with different levels of \neconomic development? To address this question, we separate out high-income countries \nbased on the World Bank classification, which are slightly more than 30% of our total \ncross-section sample, from the rest of the group in our sample (developing countries) \nand introduce a dummy variable for the latter. We interacted this dummy variable with \nour three measures of financial development to see if the effect of financial sector \n\n1 \n\nInclusion of financial development indicators in a growth regression is often criticized for its possible simultaneity \nproblem. Essentially, this problem leads to a biased estimate for the parameters. Some authors tackled this issue \nby using an IV method to control for endogeneity (Levine et al. 2000, Beck and Levine 2004). The fact that our \nestimates are consistent with that found previously in the literature suggests that the bias, which could possibly \nbe caused by the simultaneity problem in this case, is not a serious one.\n\n2  See Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt and Levine (2008) for a summary.\n\n\fFinancial Development and Economic Growth in Developing Asia | 27\n\ndevelopment is significantly different for developing countries. The results do not suggest \nany significant difference between the two groups of countries in terms of the effect of \nfinancial development on growth.\n\nThe next issue we address is whether financial development has a differential impact \non developing Asian countries. To resolve this issue, we introduce a dummy variable \nthat takes on the value of 1 for developing Asian countries and 0 for the rest of the \nsample. The coefficients of bank credit and stock market capitalization are not statistically \nsignificant. This implies that the effect of bank and capital market development is not \nnoticeably stronger or weaker for the region than elsewhere. On the other hand, liquid \nliabilities, the broadest measure of financial depth, have a positive and significant effect \non growth. This reinforces our central finding that what matters the most for growth is \noverall financial development.\n\nThe next issue is whether there has been a change in the effect of finance on growth \nin developing Asia since the Asian financial crisis. Our examination of the stylized facts \nindicated that there has been a noticeable slowdown of bank credit in the region since \nthe crisis. To some extent, the slowdown reflected a reversal of the excessive lending \nand investment of the precrisis period and better risk management by banks in the \npostcrisis period. More broadly, the Asian crisis represents a major structural break in the \nregion\u2019s financial systems due to their extensive restructuring and reform in the postcrisis \nperiod. The dummy variable for developing Asia is insignificant for all three financial \ndevelopment indicators. The Asian financial crisis, despite its far-reaching impact on the \nregion\u2019s financial systems, does not seem to have affected the finance\u2013growth nexus in \nthe region. However, the inaccuracy of traditional indicators as a measure of financial \ndevelopment is a major problem here because they fail to capture the improvement of \nAsian banking system\u2019s soundness and efficiency since the Asian crisis.\n\nWe now report the results of baseline TFP growth regressions in Tables 5\u20138. The \nbaseline regressions seek to explain TFP growth with the same sets of financial indicators \nand control variables that we used for the per capita GDP growth regressions, and \ndo not include financial openness as an additional explanatory variable. The financial \ndevelopment indicators are total liquid liabilities for Table 5, bank credit for Table 6, \nand stock market capitalization for Table 7. Table 8 includes both bank credit and stock \nmarket capitalization as separate explanatory variables. In contrast to the per capita \nGDP growth regressions, we fail to find any evidence of a positive impact of financial \ndevelopment on TFP growth. All three financial development indicators\u2014liquid liabilities, \nbank credit, and stock market capitalization\u2014are found to be insignificant. On the face \nof it, this suggests that the primary contribution of financial development is through \nmobilization of savings for investment and capital accumulation rather than by fostering \nproductivity and efficiency. This is plausible in view of the fact that the majority of our \nsample countries are developing countries. An important caveat to such an interpretation \nis that what matters for TFP growth is not so much financial deepening as measured by \n\n\f28 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 233\n\nthe traditional indicators but the specific mechanisms through which financial systems. \nTherefore, a more accurate measure of financial development is required before we can \nmore meaningfully assess the impact of financial development on TFP growth. By and \nlarge, the control variables have the expected signs and some of them are significant.3\n\nTable 5: TFP Growth Regression Results \n(financial indicator = total liquid liabilities)\n\n\u00a0\nInitial TFP\n\nYears of schooling\n\nGovernment spending, % of GDP\n\nTrade openness, % of GDP\n\nInflation\n\nGovernance\n\nLiquid liabilities, % of GDP\n\u00a0\nLiquid liabilities x developing country dummy\n\u00a0\nLiquid liabilities x DMC dummy\n\u00a0\nLiquid liabilities x postcrisis dummy\n\u00a0\nConstant\n\n(1)\n-10.013***\n(-6.212)\n-5.152***\n(-3.637)\n-2.140**\n(-2.162)\n-0.657***\n(-3.007)\n\n3.355***\n(4.595)\n-0.063\n(-0.384)\n0.092\n(0.139)\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n46.455***\n(4.842)\n\n(2)\n-10.120***\n(-6.110)\n-5.190***\n(-3.601)\n-2.099**\n(-2.119)\n-0.660***\n(-3.011)\n\n3.342***\n(4.563)\n-0.051\n(-0.309)\n1.021\n(1.345)\n-1.160\n(-1.115)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n46.196***\n(4.840)\n\n(3)\n-10.066***\n(-6.480)\n-5.177***\n(-3.708)\n-1.956*\n(-1.959)\n-0.679***\n(-3.148)\n\n3.137***\n(4.428)\n-0.038\n(-0.231)\n-0.290\n(-0.413)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n1.612\n(1.008)\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n47.402***\n(5.333)\n\nObservations\nNumber of economies\nAdjusted R-squared\n*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.\nDMC = developing member country, GDP = gross domestic product, TFP = total factor productivity.\nNote: \nSource:   Authors\u2019 estimates.\n\nRobust t-statistics in parentheses.\n\n363\n111\n\n363\n111\n\n0.292\n\n0.292\n\n363\n111\n\n0.295\n\n0.290\n\n(4)\n-10.098***\n(-6.495)\n-5.287***\n(-3.763)\n-2.081**\n(-2.064)\n-0.662***\n(-3.043)\n\n3.299***\n(4.585)\n-0.055\n(-0.332)\n0.022\n(0.034)\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n0.067\n(0.513)\n47.354***\n(5.283)\n\n363\n111\n\n3  An exception is the negative and significant coefficient of education, which is puzzling and difficult to explain. \n\nHowever, when we run the between effects model, education becomes insignificant.  In a between effects model, \nwe control for the time-specific characteristics of a sample by transforming the data into its country means to \nestimate the parameters of interest. Consequently, we only exploit the country variations of the data to produce \nthe regression results. When we run the least squares dummy variable (LSDV) model, education becomes positive \nand significant.

baseline regressions, we ran regressions that are identical to the \nbaseline regressions except that we added financial openness\u2014empirically measured \nby the ratio of total capital inflows to GDP\u2014as an additional explanatory variable for \nper capita GDP growth. Financial openness and financial development are separate \nconcepts and it is possible for countries to be financially open but underdeveloped or vice \nversa. However, there are potentially important channels for financial openness to have \na positive influence on financial development. For example, underdeveloped Asian bond \nmarkets are likely to benefit from an influx of foreign institutional investors with a wealth \nof experience and knowledge. On the downside, potentially short-term capital inflows can \nbe a major source of instability in the financial markets that can have adverse effects on \nfinancial development. Furthermore, financial openness, especially but not only foreign \ndirect investment, can have a direct positive effect on the real economy by bringing in \nadvanced technology and know-how as well as fostering greater competition in domestic \nmarkets. For all of these reasons, it is worthwhile to explore the effect of financial \nopenness even though it is distinct from financial development.\n\nTables 9\u201312 report the results of those per capita GDP growth regressions. Financial \ndevelopment indicators are total liquid liabilities for Table 9, bank credit for Table 10, and \nstock market capitalization for Table 11. Table 12 includes both bank credit and stock \nmarket capitalization as separate explanatory variables. We also interacted financial \nopenness with dummy variables for developing countries, developing Asian countries, \nand post-Asian crisis period for developing Asian countries. Across most specifications \nand for all three measures of financial development, financial openness has a positive \nand significant effect on growth. The only exception is Table 12 where both bank credit \nand stock market capitalization are included as explanatory variables. Furthermore, the \ninclusion of financial openness does not change our results for the three indicators of \nfinancial development, which remain positive and significant. Therefore, according to our \nevidence, both financial development and financial openness are beneficial for growth. \nOur results also suggest that financial openness has a greater positive growth impact for \ndeveloping countries than industrialized countries. In the latter, the high initial degree of \nopenness is likely to be high, which may limit further opening as well as marginal returns \nto opening. Turning to developing Asian countries, total liquid liabilities remain the only \nfinancial variable showing a difference from the rest of the sample, lending further support \nto the notion that overall financial deepening matters more the most for Asian growth. \nFor Asian countries in the post-Asian crisis period, financial openness has a significantly \nmore positive effect in the postcrisis period. On the other hand, two financial development \nindicators\u2014liquid liabilities and bank credit\u2014have a significantly more negative effect but \nthis probably reflects correction of excesses in the precrisis period. Overall, our relatively \nrobust findings of a beneficial effect of financial openness for growth call for careful and \nselective design and implementation of any restrictions against capital inflows.\n\n\fFinancial Development and Economic Growth in Developing Asia | 33\n\nTable 9: Real per Capita GDP Growth Regression Results, Financial Openness Included \n(financial indicator = total

Growth in Developing Asia | 37\n\nWe now turn to the results of TFP growth regressions that include financial openness. \nTables 13\u201316 seek to explain TFP growth with the same sets of financial indicators and \ncontrol variables that we used for the baseline regressions, but we include financial \nopenness as an additional explanatory variable. By and large, the control variables \nhave the expected signs and some of them are significant. The financial development \nindicators are total liquid liabilities for Table 13, bank credit for Table 14, and stock \nmarket capitalization for Table 15. Table 16 includes both bank credit and stock market \ncapitalization as separate explanatory variables. The coefficients of financial openness \nare positive and significant regardless of the financial development indicator and across \nmost specifications. This implies that financial openness has a significant positive effect \non TFP growth. This is consistent with the findings of some earlier studies (e.g., Levine \n2001). Foreign investment often brings in new technology and skills, and forces domestic \nfirms and industries to become more efficient. On the other hand, the coefficients of all \nthree financial development indicators remain insignificant, as they were in the baseline \nTFP growth regressions without financial openness. Therefore, the overall evidence in \nTables 13\u201316 implies that financial openness may exert a larger effect on TFP growth \nthan financial development. This is intuitively plausible in light of the fact that foreign \ninvestment has a direct effect on the productivity of domestic firms and industries, e.g., \nby exposing them to greater competition; whereas the effect of financial development is \nmore indirect, e.g., via a more sound and efficient financial system. \n\n\f38 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 233\n\nTable 13: TFP Growth

most significant finding from our empirical analysis is a significant and positive effect \nof financial development on real per capita GDP growth. Regardless of which measure \nof financial depth we use, whether total liquid liabilities, bank credit, or stock market \ncapitalization, we find a consistently positive and significant impact on growth across all \nspecifications. Our evidence is consistent with the bulk of the existing empirical literature. \nFurthermore, our control variables have the expected signs and many are significant, \na fact that lends further support to the robustness of our results. Our central finding \nthat bank development, capital market development, and total liquid liabilities of the \nfinancial system are all beneficial for growth suggests that what matters for growth is \noverall financial deepening rather than the structure of the financial system. Therefore, \nthe balance between banks and capital markets matter much less for growth than \nwell-functioning banks and capital markets. We do not find any evidence of significant \ndifferences between developing countries and industrialized countries in terms of the \nfinance\u2013growth nexus. For the developing Asian countries, we find that total liquid \nliabilities have a bigger impact on growth than in the rest of our sample. This further \naccentuates the importance of overall financial development, as opposed to financial \nstructure, as a significant contributor to growth. A control variable of particular interest to \nus is financial openness. Our evidence strongly indicates that financial openness has a \npositive and significant effect on real per capita GDP growth. Therefore, according to the \nresults of our empirical analysis, both financial development and financial openness are \nbeneficial for growth. Our TFP growth regressions fail to yield any evidence of a positive \neffect of financial development. This result may be due to the measurement problems \nassociated with traditional financial development indicators, which fail to capture the \nspecific channels through which financial systems promote efficiency and productivity in \nan economy. We find that financial openness, in contrast to financial development, has \na significant and positive effect on TFP growth. We also find that financial openness has \na bigger growth effect for developing countries. Finally, in developing Asian countries \nin the post-Asian crisis period, the impact of financial openness on growth has become \nlarger than in the rest of the world while the impact of financial development has become \nsomewhat smaller.\n\nV. Concluding Observations and Policy Implications\n\nOur empirical analysis yields evidence that is strongly supportive of a positive influence \nof financial development on economic growth. Our findings indicate that overall financial \ndevelopment, as well as bank development and stock market development, all exert a \nsignificant positive effect on real per capita GDP growth. The evidence is robust and \nconsistent across different specifications for both developed and developing countries. All \n\n\fFinancial Development and Economic Growth in Developing Asia | 43\n\nthe control variables have the expected signs and many of them are significant. Overall, \nour results are very much in line with existing empirical literature, most of which uncover \na positive relationship between finance and growth. Our evidence is also consistent with \neconomic theory, which throws up a number of intuitively plausible rationales for why \nwell-functioning financial systems matter for growth. These include producing information \nand allocating capital; monitoring firm behavior and exerting corporate governance; \nfacilitating the hedging, trading, and pooling of risk; mobilizing savings for investment; and \nreducing the transactions costs of economic exchange and activity. An accurate measure \nof financial development would capture how well the banks and stock and bond markets \nperform the above growth-promoting functions. However, following the existing empirical \nliterature, we use the traditional, highly imperfect measures of financial development. \nSuch measurement problems may help to explain why we fail to find any evidence \nof a positive influence of financial development on TFP growth. Developing empirical \nmeasures of financial development that are more closely aligned with the theoretical \nconcept of financial development remains a vital area for future research.\n\nOur empirical analysis produces two important results especially relevant for developing \nAsia. The first result is that the total liquid liabilities of the financial system have a bigger \nimpact on developing Asia\u2019s growth than in other parts of the world. Overall financial \ndevelopment matters more for the region than other regions, but the impact of bank and \nstock market development on developing Asia\u2019s growth is not appreciably different from \nits impact on the growth of other regions. This suggests that what matters for the region\u2019s \ngrowth is not the development of particular components of the financial system but the \ndevelopment of the financial system as a whole. Our evidence is consistent with one \nof the key findings of the empirical literature, namely that overall financial development \nmatters much more for growth than the structure of the financial system, i.e., relative \nweight of banks versus equity and bond markets. The second result is that there seems \nto have been a sharp drop-off in the effect of finance on growth since the Asian financial \ncrisis. On the face of it, this would suggest that financial development matters less for \ngrowth in the post-Asian crisis period. However, the more plausible interpretation is that \nthe apparent structural change reflects a reversion of overlending and overinvestment in \nthe precrisis period to more sustainable levels of lending and investment. It would take \na leap of faith to view a banking boom characterized by reckless lending and rapidly \ndeteriorating quality of investment as financial development. Such booms are typically \nfollowed by banking busts that inflict hardship on the real economy. The Asian crisis, \nwhich was a classical example of such boom-bust cycles, underlines the measurement \nproblems associated with the traditional empirical proxies for financial development.\n\nThe marked decline in the contribution of financial development to economic growth since \nthe Asian crisis also highlights another important point. While the returns to investment \nand, by extension, the returns to financial development that mobilizes large quantities \nof savings to finance large amounts of investments, tend to be high at lower-income \nlevels, they both tend to fall as a country accumulates a larger capital stock of capital \n\n\f44 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 233\n\nover time. In a fundamental sense, the Asian crisis highlighted the risks of a failure to \nshift from a growth based on inputs and factor accumulation to an alternative growth path \nbased on productivity gains. Maintaining very high investment rates when the economy \nhas already built up a large capital stock leads to unsustainable overinvestment. This \nmay characterize the situation of the crisis-hit middle- and upper middle-income East \nand Southeast Asian countries prior to the Asian crisis. While a financial system that is \ngood at mobilizing savings for investment is essential for economic success for poor, \nlow-income countries, a financial system that is good at promoting static and dynamic \nefficiency improvements becomes increasingly more important as countries grow richer. \nPut differently, over time the primary contribution of financial development to growth shifts \nfrom augmenting the quantity of investment to lifting up the efficiency of investment. A \nfinancial system has to evolve along with a country\u2019s overall development level in order to \ncontribute to growth on a sustained basis. To some extent, the decline in the contribution \nof financial development since the Asian crisis could reflect the fact that the evolution is \nstill incomplete. \n\nOne control variable that is of particular interest to us is financial openness, which is \nempirically proxied by capital inflows as share of GDP. Financial openness is of particular \ninterest since financial globalization contributed to the Asian crisis and the prospect of \nlarge capital inflows has reignited serious discussion of capital controls across the region. \nOur results yield robust and consistent evidence of a significant positive influence of \nfinancial openness on economic growth. In addition to augmenting the supply of savings \navailable for investment, foreign investors often bring in new technology, management, \nand know-how that boost the domestic economy\u2019s productivity and efficiency. The \nproductivity spill-over effect is likely to dominate the savings augmentation effect in light \nof developing Asia\u2019s abundance of savings. Indeed, our results indicate that financial \nopenness has a significant positive effect on TFP growth. While financial openness and \nfinancial development are separate concepts, the two are not completely independent of \neach other. In particular, foreign investment in domestic financial institutions and markets \ncan foster financial development. For example, the entry of world-class foreign banks \ninto the domestic banking market forces domestic banks to raise their game. Likewise, \nforeign institutional investors bring a wealth of expertise, experience, and knowledge to \nthe region\u2019s underdeveloped bond markets, and thereby speed up its development. On \nthe other hand, foreign capital can be a major source of instability. This is especially true \nfor potentially volatile short-term portfolio investments that can easily be withdrawn and \nreversed.\n\nThere are a number of key messages which emerge from our empirical analysis for \ndeveloping Asia\u2019s policymakers. Above all, our central finding that financial development \nhas a positive, significant effect on growth, suggesting that financial development will be \na key ingredient of the region\u2019s medium- and long-run growth. The obvious corollary is \nthat policy efforts seeking to further strengthen and improve the region\u2019s financial systems \nwill yield dividends for growth. In addition, our evidence indicates that what matters more \n\n\fFinancial Development and Economic Growth in Developing Asia | 45\n\nfor developing Asia is overall financial development rather than development of particular \ncomponents of the financial system. Therefore, the region\u2019s policymakers should \nconcentrate their efforts on institutional and policy reforms benefiting the financial system \nas a whole, rather than concern themselves about the relative weight of banks versus \ncapital markets. Put differently, the most effective institutions and policies for promoting \nfinancial development are those that have a positive influence on both banks and capital \nmarkets. More specifically, the region needs to continue to build a better institutional \ninfrastructure, which consists of two main components: effective legal and regulatory \nframeworks, and best-practice accounting and auditing standards and practices. A better \ninfrastructure is conducive for the provision of timely and accurate information, effective \nexercise of corporate governance, and adequate risk management. For example, \nstrengthening shareholder and creditor rights strengthens corporate governance. A sound \ninstitutional infrastructure benefits the entire financial system and thus facilitates overall \nfinancial development.\n\nSecond, the global financial crisis underlined the devastating impact that financial \ninstability can wreak on the real economy, even in large, advanced economies such as \nthe EU and the US. The sharpest slowdown of global economic activity and trade in \nthe postwar period originated in glaring market failures in supposedly the world\u2019s most \nadvanced financial markets. This should put to rest any doubts about the importance of \nfinancial stability for growth. Closer to home, many countries in developing Asia witnessed \nfirsthand the daunting power of financial turbulence to paralyze the real economy, even in \nthe world\u2019s fastest-growing economies, during the Asian financial crisis. The inescapable \nimplication for Asian policymakers is that safeguarding financial stability is paramount for \nsustaining medium- and long-run growth. The most direct means of safeguarding financial \nstability is to prudential regulation and supervision, and there has been a lot of progress \non this front since the Asian crisis. Another important means of furthering financial \nstability is to accelerate the development of the region\u2019s relatively less developed bond \nmarkets compared to the other major components of developing Asia\u2019s financial systems, \ni.e., banks and equity markets. In particular, while the region\u2019s government bond markets \nhave grown substantially since the Asian crisis, catalyzed initially by the recapitalization \nof banks, the corporate bond markets remain generally small, underdeveloped, and \nconfined to specific sectors such as infrastructure and energy. The primary benefit of a \nmore diversified financial structure is not so much growth but greater stability, robustness, \nand resilience during negative shocks. However, as the global and Asian crises show, \nfinancial stability can have enormous implications for growth. Policy measures to \ninvigorate the bond markets should aim to encourage greater availability of timely and \nrelevant information, reduce transactions costs, and broaden the investor base. Given \nthe underdevelopment of domestic pension funds, life insurance companies, and other \ninstitutional investors with long-term horizons, greater participation of foreign institutional \ninvestors will help to augment liquidity in the short run. Finally, well-functioning bond \nmarkets have the important added benefit of providing stable and secure source of long-\nterm capital for growth.\n\n\f46 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 233\n\nThird, expanding and improving access to financial services for both householders and \nproducers will remain a key policy priority for financial development. Aggregate financial \ndepth indicators such as the ratio of bank credit to GDP can hide substantial disparities \nacross the population of individuals and firms in the economy. For example, a large part \nof the poor and rural population may lack access to banks and other formal finance \nwhen the financial system is confined to the urban middle class. Likewise, large private \ncorporations and state-owned enterprises may enjoy good access to finance while SMEs \nand individual entrepreneurs may suffer financial exclusion. Financial access matters for \nmedium- and long-run growth primarily because it promotes equality of opportunity. For \nexample, poor but talented individuals will be unable to invest in their education or start \nup new businesses if they do not have access to credit. \n\nFurthermore, access to finance promotes the entry of new firms and innovative activities, \nthereby stimulating competition and efficiency. The role of financial system in allocating \ncapital to its most productive uses inevitably suffers when large parts of the economy lie \noutside the financial system. Entrepreneurship is often frustrated and good business plans \nnever materialize. Overall access to finance in developing Asia remains substantially \nbelow that of the industrialized countries. Promoting equality of opportunity, policies, and \ninstitutions that expand the reach of finance in the region will help to bring about a more \ninclusive growth with lower poverty and inequality. Specific examples of such policies \nand institutions include setting up credit registries that allow lenders to share information \nabout their clients\u2019 repayment records and reducing the transaction costs associated with \nrepossessing collateral in the event of default (World Bank 2008).\n\nFourth, speeding up the integration of developing Asia\u2019s financial markets, especially \nbond markets, can yield substantial gains for the region\u2019s financial development. Even \namong subregions where trade integration has reached fairly high levels, most notably \nEast and Southeast Asia, the level of financial integration remains low. This suggests that \nstrengthening regional financial integration is an important means of furthering overall \nfinancial openness, which is beneficial to growth according to our evidence. Regional \nfinancial integration can confer a number of important benefits for the region. Above \nall, regional financial integration creates bigger, broader, deeper, more liquid and more \nefficient financial markets, a benefit that is especially relevant for the region\u2019s small, \nilliquid, and fragmented bond markets. Greater integration of those bond markets will \nenable the region to reap large benefits from economies of scale. Integration can also \nspeed up regional intermediation of the large regional pool of savings, provide resilience \nagainst shocks, diversify the investor base, and allow for sharing of idiosyncratic risk \nacross countries. According to Ghosh (2006), while cross-border restrictions have come \ndown sharply across the region, a wide range of impediments still stand in the way of free \ncapital flows. These include withholding taxes, lack of hedging instruments; differences in \nmarket practices and infrastructure; and differences in credit rating, legal and regulatory \nsystems, and accounting and auditing standards. There are a number of policy options \nto speed up financial integration among Asian countries, including closer regional \n\n\fFinancial Development and Economic Growth in Developing Asia | 47\n\ncooperation to remove remaining obstacles to cross-border investment; creating regional \nfinancial products such as regional index funds; and addressing differences in credit \nrating, accounting and auditing standards, as well as legal and regulatory frameworks; \nand setting up a regional credit rating agency that would help improve assessment of \ncredit risk.\n\nFifth, financial development requires very different institutional and policy reforms in \ndifferent developing Asian countries since they are at very different levels of economic, \ninstitutional, and financial development. Developing Asia is a highly heterogeneous region \nencompassing a diverse mix of countries, ranging from some of the world\u2019s poorest \neconomies to economies that are approaching rich-world incomes. Quite predictably, \nthere is a great deal of heterogeneity in the level of financial development, ranging \nfrom rudimentary financial systems to highly sophisticated financial centers such as \nHong Kong, China and Singapore. Some of our policy messages, such as the need to \nstrengthen the institutional infrastructure of the financial system, remain relevant and \napplicable to the entire region, notwithstanding such diversity. At the same time, the \ndiversity of financial needs means that the role of the financial system in economic growth \nwill differ substantially across countries. For example, while the relative importance of \nmobilizing savings for investment is likely to decline for developing Asia as a whole, \nit will remain important in lower-income countries where high investment and capital \naccumulation still matters a lot for growth. In lower-income countries, building up a well-\nfunctioning banking system takes precedence over diversifying financial structure with \nstock and equity markets. The dilemma of the extent to which risk transfer and sharing \ninstruments such as derivatives and securitization should be permitted is much more \ngermane to the financially more developed economies, as is the issue of desirability and \nfeasibility of greater financial integration.\n\nA critical issue facing developing Asia\u2019s prudential regulation and supervision authorities \nin the aftermath of the global financial crisis is the extent to which they should allow new \nfinancial products, services, and technologies\u2014i.e., the speed and scope of financial \ninnovation. If financial innovation can wreak such havoc on big, deep, broad, liquid, and \nsophisticated financial markets such as that of the EU and the US, it may be tempting \nfor financially underdeveloped Asian countries to conclude that they promote financial \ninnovation at their own risk. However, financial backwardness, which fortuitously protected \nAsia this time around, entails potentially large costs of its own, as the Asian crisis made \nall too clear. As Prasad (2010) points out, regulatory challenges facing emerging markets \nare more about risks of having underdeveloped financial systems rather than risks from \nsophisticated financial innovations. Furthermore, developing Asia\u2019s banks have already \nreaped substantial benefits from innovations of their own, including moving into new \nbusiness activities such as investment banking, household lending and real estate, and \nproducing a wider range of products and services. It is not financial innovation itself \nbut rather the complete failure of prudential regulators to identify and control the risks \nstemming from innovation, along with their failure to provide incentives for financial \n\n\f48 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 233\n\ninstitutions to exercise proper risk management that triggered the global financial crisis. \nIt may thus be more productive for Asian authorities to apply the lessons learned from \nthe crisis, e.g., what are the specific risks in financial innovation, to their financial \nreform process and to provide market players with the appropriate incentives for risk \nmanagement. The global crisis may even benefit the financial reform process in Asia by \nenabling the region to avoid the regulatory mistakes of the EU and the US.\n\nIn conclusion, it should first be noted that developing Asia has come a long way in terms \nof financial development since the Asian financial crisis. That crisis served as a wake-up \ncall for far-reaching reform and restructuring that greatly improved the financial health and \nperformance of the region\u2019s banking system, which remains the mainstay of its financial \nsystem. The region\u2019s financial system has also become more diversified as a result of the \nrapid growth of its equity markets, and to a lesser extent, its bond markets. Furthermore, \nprudential regulation and supervision systems have been strengthened to be more \nflexible and adaptable to changing conditions. As a result of these positive developments, \nthe region\u2019s financial systems have become substantially more robust and efficient, a \nfact which, together with their limited exposure to subprime assets, has protected the \nregion from the financial turbulence that devastated their counterparts in financially more \nadvanced economies. However, despite the great deal of progress, there is still significant \nscope for further improving the robustness and efficiency of the region\u2019s financial \nsystems. In particular, building a better institutional infrastructure for the financial system \nas a whole; and bigger, broader, deeper, more liquid, and more sophisticated bond \nmarkets, especially corporate bond markets, will yield returns for economic growth both \ndirectly and indirectly through enhanced financial stability. Expanding access to finance to \nmore households and producers is another high-priority policy area since greater financial \naccess not only promotes growth but promotes inclusive growth by fostering equality of \nopportunity.\n\nIn the broader context of sustaining developing Asia\u2019s growth beyond the global crisis, \nfinancial development matters, and matters a lot, because investment matters, and \nmatters a lot. However, there is a likely to be a gradual but clear change in developing \nAsia\u2019s growth paradigm from a growth driven primarily by inputs and factor accumulation \nto a growth based on productivity growth. For example, Park and Park (2010) find some \nempirical evidence that since around 2002 there has been a relative shift in the source \nof the region\u2019s growth from capital accumulation to TFP growth. What this means is \nthat efficiency of investment will increasingly overshadow the quantity of investment as \nthe primary source of sustainable growth. A sound and efficient financial system is vital \nfor the transition from the region\u2019s precrisis, accumulation-led growth paradigm to its \npostcrisis, productivity-led growth paradigm for the simple reason that the primary function \nof banks, stock markets and bond markets is to allocate capital to its most productive \nuses. In addition to a more efficient allocation of resources in the static sense, dynamic \nefficiency is likely to grow in importance in developing Asia\u2019s postcrisis growth process \nand again, a well-functioning financial system will play a key role. A more innovative and \n\n\fFinancial Development and Economic Growth in Developing Asia | 49\n\nknowledge-based economy is likely to flourish when would-be entrepreneurs with the \nbest new ideas and new ways of doing things have access to the capital they need to \ntransform their vision into commercial reality. Institutions such as venture capital that are \nstill in their infancy in developing Asia, general expansion of access to financial services, \nand new financial products and services that reduce transactions costs and further \nspecialization will all be required if Asian finance is to transform itself from a tool for \nmobilizing savings to a tool for fostering productivity. If Asian finance is to become a vital \nlink between Asia\u2019s old growth paradigm of accumulation to Asia\u2019s new growth paradigm \nof efficiency, Asian finance will have to evolve. \n\n\f50 |

Their evidence suggests \nthat further development of the financial sector will have a positive impact on developing \nAsia\u2019s growth. However, the primary role of financial development in growth is likely to shift \naway from quantitative mobilization of savings and investment toward improvement of the \nefficiency and quality of investment.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their \npeople. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s \npoor: 1.8 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on \nless than $1.25 a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic \ngrowth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. \n \nmain instruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, \nequity investments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region.
