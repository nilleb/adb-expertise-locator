The  MCP  has  both  costs  and  benefits.   The  costs  include  the  social  loss \nassociated with seigniorage, the inability to conduct an independent monetary policy \nand the relative ineffectiveness of the exchange rate as an adjustment mechanism. \nThe benefits of the MCP include the discipline imposed on the government by limiting \nits  capacity  to  finance  spending  through  inflation  tax,  and  the  stability  and  certainty \ninduced by an effectively fixed exchange rate. Since the costs appear to exceed the \nbenefits, how should the Government of Lao PDR respond? Enforcing the use of the \nkip is not the answer, and may well be counter-productive.  This is because the MCP \nis not the problem, but is merely a symptom.  The problem is a lack of confidence in \nthe kip, whilst the symptom is the use of another currency such as the dollar or baht.  \nThe  causes  of  the  problem  emanate  from  an  underdeveloped  monetary  system, \nmacroeconomic  instability,  and  weak  legal  and  institutional  systems.  These  are  the \nproblems that need to be addressed directly.  When these problems are addressed, \nthen the symptom, which is the MCP, will also cease to be a constraint.   \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1. Introduction \nThe  monetary  situation  in  most  transitional  economies  is  characterised  by  the \n\nmultiple  currency  phenomenon  (MCP).    Generally,  the  MCP  takes  the  form  of \n\ndollarization.  Dollarization  is  defined  as  the  widespread  use  of  the  US  dollar  as  a \n\nmedium of exchange and a store of value in the presence of the national currency.  \n\nLao PDR provides an almost unique case study of the MCP. This is because there \n\nare two foreign currencies, the US dollar and Thai baht, which are widely used as a \n\nsubstitute for the national currency, kip.  The impacts of the MCP a la the Lao case \nare more complex than dollarization, and not very well understood.1 Furthermore, the \n\nliterature  has  ignored  the  experience  of  the  Asian  transitional  economies,  and \nfocussed on the experience of the Latin American and South American countries.2 In \n\nthis paper, we try and overcome this knowledge gap through a careful analysis of the \n\nimplications of the MCP in Lao PDR.  What are the costs and benefits of the MCP?  \n\nWhat  policy  should  the  Government  pursue,  if  any,  in  responding  to  the  MCP?  \n\nThese are some of the questions that we address in this paper. \n\nWe begin in Section 2 by considering what the MCP means.  In Section 3, we assess \n\nthe potential costs of the MCP, while Section 4 looks at the potential benefits of the \n\nMCP.    Policy  responses  to  the  MCP  are  the  subject  of  Section  5.    Here  we  also \n\nassess  the  efficacy  of  the  Government\u2019s  policy  of  trying  to  increase  the  use  of  kip \n\nthrough enforcement measures.  A final section concludes. \n\n2. What is the Multiple Currency Phenomenon (MCP)? \n\nThe literature on the use of multiple currencies in a domestic economy distinguishes \n\nbetween  two  concepts:  currency  substitution  and  dollarization  (see,  for  instance, \n\nSahay  and  Vegh  (1995);  Calvo  and  Vegh  (1995);  Bruno  (1993)).    Currency \n\nsubstitution is defined as the use of a foreign currency as a medium of exchange in \n\nthe domestic economy.  Dollarization is defined as the use of a foreign currency as a \n\nmedium of exchange and a store of value in the presence of a  domestically  issued \n\ncurrency.    Thus,  dollarization  encompasses  currency  substitution  but  extends  it  to \ninclude the store of value function.3 \n\n                                                            \n1 The range of substitution possibilities following movements in cross-rates for instance is greater than \nwhen only one foreign currency is used in the presence of the domestically issued currency. \n2 See, for instance, Salvatore et al. (2003), Berg and Borensztein (2000), and Sahay and Vegh (1995). \n3 Neither of these two definitions explicitly refers to the unit of account function of money.  Nevertheless, \nsince both definitions refer to the medium of exchange function, the unit of account function is implied in \nboth cases. \n\n\f   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe situation in Lao PDR is unique in that it does not fit into either the dollarization \n\ndefinition  or  the  currency  substitution  definition,  since  there  are  two  foreign \n\ncurrencies that are used domestically.  In addition to the Thai baht and the US dollar, \n\nthe  dong  and  the  yuan  are  also  used  in  cross-border  trade  in  the  provinces  that \n\nborder Viet Nam and Yunnan, but only as a medium of exchange.  Both the baht and \n\ndollar serve all the three functions of money in Lao PDR: they are widely used as a \n\nmedium  of  exchange,  store  of  wealth  and  unit  of  account.    Thus,  although  the \n\nsituation in Lao is more complicated than that implied by dollarization, it is closer to \n\nthis  definition  than  it  is  to  currency  substitution.    The  kip  also  serves  all  the  three \n\nfunctions of money, but its use as a store of wealth is arguably less significant than \n\nwith the foreign currencies.  \n\n3. Costs of the MCP \n\n3.1 Seigniorage \n\nThe first and perhaps most significant cost of the MCP is the loss in \u201cseigniorage\u201d by \n\nthe national monetary authority. Basically, seigniorage is the difference between the \n\nface  value  of  currency  and  the  cost  of  producing  it.  The  ability  of  governments  to \n\nissue  token  or  paper  money  generates  a  very  large  social  saving  in  the  use  of \nresources.4 There  are  both  stock  and  flow  components  associated  with  the  social \n\ncost  of  the  MCP.    We  begin  by  considering  the  costs  emanating  from  the  stock \n\ncomponent. \n\nSeigniorage: the stock component \n\nThe stock component can be best understood by looking at how the dollars or baht \n\nwere  brought  into  circulation.    Every  baht  and  dollar  note  currently  in  circulation  in \n\nLao  PDR,  apart  from  unilateral  transfers  in  the  form  of  aid  flows,  was  obtained  by \n\nexchanging goods, services, or claims on assets, equivalent to the face value of the \n\nstock of foreign currency in circulation. Thus, the seigniorage does not accrue to Lao \n\nPDR, but only to the issuing agency (in this case Thailand and the US).  \n\nThere  is  also  a  flow  aspect  related  to  the  stock  component  in  the  form  of  holding \n\ncost. The holding cost associated with the current stock of baht and dollars used for \n\ntransaction purposes is the income foregone on interest-bearing assets.  This is the \n\nincome that could have been earned if the stock of foreign currency currently held for \n\n                                                            \n4 During the Gold standard for instance, this saving resulted from resources that would otherwise have \nto  be  expended  in  mining  and  smelting  large  quantities  of  metal  such  as  gold.    Similarly,  the  MCP \ndeprives governments of this social saving to a large extent. \n\n\f   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ntransactions purposes was invested in income-bearing assets such as bank deposits \nor  bonds. 5  The  interest  foregone  on  holding  domestically  issued  currency  for \n\ntransaction  purposes  has  no  net  effect  on  the  domestic  economy;  it  only  has  a \n\ndistributional effect within the economy.  That is, there is a transfer between citizens, \nbut no net change in overall income or welfare.6 \n\nSeigniorage: the flow component \n\nIf  the  stock  component  of  seigniorage  involved  a  one-off  process  of  recouping  the \n\nbaht  and  dollars  currently  held  for  transaction  purposes,  then  the  costs  associated \n\nwith the flow component relate to the demand for money over time.  With economic \ngrowth, there will be an increasing demand for money for transaction purposes.7  To \n\nincrease the stock of baht and dollars in Lao PDR, there must again be an exchange \n\nof  goods,  services,  or  claims  on  assets,  which  take  place  to  bring  the  additional \n\nforeign  currency  into  the  country.    In  effect,  Lao  PDR  will  have  to  run  a  balance  of \n\npayments surplus in order to increase its money supply.   \n\nIt would be easier to understand the flow component if we thought of the benefits of \n\nbeing rid of the MCP, rather than the costs of the MCP. Consider a case where Lao \n\nPDR\u2019s GDP grows by 6 percent in a given year.  Assume further that as a result the \n\ntransactions demand for money also increases by 6 percent.  Without the MCP, this \n\nwould  mean  that  the  government  could  run  a  budget  deficit  (or  reduce  its  budget \n\nsurplus) by 6 percent without increasing inflation.  That is, the growth in the economy \n\nallows  the  government  to  finance  the  budget  deficit,  or  reduce  the  budget  surplus, \n\nthrough  the  printing  of  money  in  a  non-inflationary  way.    Indeed,  without  the  MCP, \n\nthe  Lao  PDR  government  could  increase  its  budget  deficit  or  reduce  its  budget \n\nsurplus  by  the  amount  of  the  increase  in  transactions  demand  for  money  simply \n\nthrough the printing of money and without any increase in inflationary pressures.   \n\n                                                            \n5 Note  that  this  holding  cost  applies  only  in  the  case  where  a  foreign  currency  is  used  to  serve  the \nfunction of domestic money.  The holding cost does not apply when the domestically issued currency is \nheld  for  transaction  purposes.    This  is  because  there  is  no,  or  little,  cost  associated  with  meeting  the \ntransactions demand for domestically issued money.  The Central Bank could simply print the amounts \nrequired  for  transaction  purposes,  and  the  only  cost  incurred  in  this  instance  is  the  cost  of  printing \nmoney (rather than the cost equal to the face value of the money). \n6 To illustrate, consider the current situation in Lao PDR.  If kip is held for transaction purposes, then the \nnet  effect  (in  terms  of  interest  foregone)  is  zero  because  kip  cannot  be  invested  in  banks  or  bonds \noverseas.  If it could, then there would be a net inflow of income to the Lao economy (which is equivalent \nto  the  income  foregone  by  not  investing  the  kip  overseas).  If  US  dollars  are  held  for  transaction \npurposes, then the net effect (in terms of interest foregone) is equivalent to the income foregone by not \ninvesting the US dollars in banks or bonds overseas. \n7 In theory, the demand for money should decrease over time as financial development results in a \nreduced need for currency to effect transactions.  Given the low level of development of the financial \nsystem in Lao PDR, this is unlikely to happen for some time. \n\n\f   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn an economy with only foreign currencies in use, on the other hand, the increase in \n\nthe transactions demand for money caused by economic growth can only be met by \n\na  balance  of  payments  surplus.    That  is,  there  must  be  an  increase  in  the  stock  of \n\ndollars or baht in circulation equivalent to the increase in the transactions demand for \n\nmoney.  If this increased demand for transactions balances cannot be met, then it is \n\nlikely  to  be  deflationary.    Meeting  this  increased  demand  for  transaction  balances \n\ninvolves a waste of resources equivalent to the loss in seigniorage. \n\nThe current situation in Lao PDR: impacts of stocks and flows \n\nThe kip is estimated to constitute about 50 percent of the money stock in Lao PDR.  \n\nThe baht is estimated at 30 percent, and dollars apparently make up the remaining \n20  percent  of  the  money  stock.8   In  this  situation,  the  difference  between  the  face \n\nvalue of this stock of kip, and the cost of producing it, is social saving in the form of \n\nseigniorage. Indeed, if the government exercises monetary discipline and increases \n\nthe stock of kip by a percentage equivalent to GDP growth times the share of kip in \n\nthe  money  stock,  then  it  will  earn  seigniorage  on  these  new  notes  on  a  continuing \n\nbasis. If GDP growth is 6 percent, and transactions demand for money increases by \n\n6  percent,  then  the  government  can  print  money  in  a  non-inflationary  manner  (and \n\nearn seigniorage) in the amount of: \n\n \n\n0.5   x   0.06  x   the money stock; \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(1) \n\nwhere 0.5 = the share of kip in the money stock \n\nand  0.06  =  the  growth  in  transactions  demand  for  money  (driven  by  economic \n\ngrowth). \n\nWhat  if  the  share  of  kip  in  the  money  stock  could  be  increased  over  time  from  50 \n\npercent  to  60  percent,  for  instance?    Using  the  example  above,  we  can  see  how \n\nincreasing the use of kip in the economy could result in quite substantial social gains \n\nfrom  seigniorage.    The  gains  will  come  from  both  the  stock  and  flow  components.  \n\nThe  stock  component  implies  that  about  10  percent  of  the  foreign  currencies  in \n\ncirculation can be exchanged, in a one-off recouping transaction, for goods, services \n\netc.,  since  these  notes  will  no  longer  be  required  for  the  medium  of  exchange \n\nfunction.  Lao  PDR  will  be  able  to  recoup  the  original  cost  incurred  in  obtaining  the \n\nstock of baht and dollars in circulation. \n\nThe one-off benefit from the stock component will equal: \n\n \n\n0.2  x   0.5  x   the money stock; \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(2) \n\n\f   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nwhere 0.2 = the percentage increase (0.1/0.5) in the share of kip from 50 percent to \n\n60 percent \n\n          0.5 = the original share of foreign currency in the money stock. \n\nThe benefits from the flow component will equal: \n\n \n\n0.6   x   0.06  x   the money stock; \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(3) \n\nwhere 0.6 = the new share of kip in the money stock \n\nand  0.06  =  the  growth  in  transactions  demand  for  money  (driven  by  economic \n\ngrowth). \n\ndiscipline. \n\nThis  benefit  from  the  flow  component  can  be  earned  on  an  on-going  basis.  \n\nIncreasing the share of kip in the money stock over time will continue to yield social \n\ngains  from  both  the  stock  and  flow  components.    The  gains  from  the  stock \n\ncomponent will cease when Lao PDR is completely free of the MCP.  The gains from \n\nthe  flow  component  will  accrue  indefinitely,  as  long  as  the  transactions  demand  for \n\nmoney  grows  with  economic  growth,  and  the  government  exercises  monetary \n\n3.2 Monetary Policy and Lender of Last Resort Function \n\nThe effective conduct of monetary policy in Lao PDR is impaired by the MCP and a \n\nweak  financial  system.  Of  course  the  MCP  and  a  weak  financial  system  are  two \n\nlimitations that are inter-related.  The MCP is a reflection of a weak financial system, \n\namong other things. \n\nThe  MCP  impairs  the  ability  of  the  Bank  of  Lao  PDR  to  conduct  an  independent \n\nmonetary policy. This is because capital inflows or outflows automatically change the \n\nmoney supply when a foreign currency can be used as a medium of exchange.  An \n\noutflow of baht or dollars contracts the money supply, whilst an inflow would expand \n\nit.    An  outflow  of  baht  or  dollars  could  be  deflationary,  whilst  an  inflow  could  be \n\ninflationary.   \n\nThe impact of these movements of capital on the money supply and domestic activity \n\ncould  be  offset  if  the  Bank  of  Lao  PDR  could  conduct  open  market  operations,  for \n\ninstance. The lack of monetary instruments in the form of kip-denominated interest-\n\nbearing  assets  prevents  the  Bank  of  Lao  from  conducting  open  market  operations.  \n\nEven if the Bank of Lao could issue kip-denominated interest-bearing assets, the lack \n\n                                                                                                                                                                          \n8  This estimate is provided by the Bank of Lao PDR.    \n\n\f   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nof  confidence  in  the  kip  would  limit  their  subscription.    Other  monetary  instruments \n\nsuch  as  changes  to  the  reserve  requirement  are  likely  to  be  blunt  instruments  of \n\nmonetary  policy  because  the  MCP  allows  capital  inflows  to  become  part  of  the \n\nmoney  stock  without  passing-through  the  financial  system.    Thus,  the  ability  to \n\nconduct  an  independent  monetary  policy  depends  on  addressing  the  MCP  and \n\nimproving the financial system. \n\nThe lender of last resort function of the Bank of Lao PDR is also somewhat impaired \n\nby the MCP.  In the case of a generalized loss of confidence in the banking system, \n\nthe monetary authorities would not be able to guarantee the whole payments system \n\nor to fully back bank deposits.  The ability to print money as required is, after all, what \n\nallows  a  central  bank  to  fully  guarantee  that  all  claims  in  domestic  currency  will  be \n\nmet.    The  MCP  reduces  the  capacity  of  the  central  bank  to  print  money,  and  thus \nalso impairs its ability to perform its function as guarantor and lender of last resort.9 \n\n3.3 The Exchange Rate Mechanism and Policy \n\nThe MCP  complicates  the  definition  and  measurement  of  the  exchange  rate  in  Lao \n\nPDR.  There  are  three  possible  definitions  of  the  nominal  exchange  rate  that  we \n\nconsider: (i) the kip/US dollar exchange rate; (ii) the kip/baht exchange rate; and (iii) \n\na \u201cno exchange rate\u201d case.  First we consider the circumstances under which each of \n\nthese definitions might apply, and then we examine the implications that follow from \n\neach. \n\nThe  kip/US  dollar  exchange  rate  is  our  benchmark  definition,  and  is  the  exchange \n\nrate that would be most relevant in the absence of the MCP.  Accordingly, it is also \n\nperhaps  the  least  relevant  definition  in  Lao  PDR  at  present  given  the  MCP.  The \n\nkip/baht exchange rate is the closest (bilateral) proxy to a trade-weighted exchange \n\nrate  in  Lao  PDR.    This  is  because  most  of  Lao  PDR\u2019s  trade  is  conducted  with \n\nThailand.  Again, this exchange rate is less important in Lao PDR than it would have \n\nbeen in the absence of the MCP.  Finally, we have the \u201cno exchange rate\u201d case.  The \n\nMCP  could  produce  an  outcome  similar  to  that  of  having  a  permanently  fixed \n\nexchange rate.  How could such a situation arise? If prices charged by exporters to \n\nLao PDR are set in dollars (or baht), and the prices of these goods in the domestic \n\nmarket  are  also  set in  dollars  (or  baht), then  movements  in the  value  of  the  kip/US \n\n                                                            \n9 Calvo\u2019s (2000) qualification that domestic banks can have access to liquidity through sources other \nthan the printing press of the central bank does not apply in the case of Lao PDR because of its weak \nfinancial system. \n\n\f   \n \n\n  \n\n \n\ndollar  exchange  rate,  the  kip/baht  exchange  rate,  or  any  other  definition  of  the \n\nexchange  rate  do  not  enter  into  the  pricing  decision  of  imports  in  the  Lao  PDR \n\nmarket.  Similarly, if prices of Lao PDR\u2019s exports are determined in world markets in \n\nUS  dollar  terms,  or  in  terms  of  baht,  then  any  movements  in  the  exchange  rates \ndescribed above will not affect prices.10  In these situations, even the term \u201cexchange \n\nrate\u201d is a misnomer because trade occurs as if without an exchange rate. \n\nWe begin by considering the implications of \u201cno exchange rate\u201d definition because it \n\nis likely to be the most relevant in the case of Lao PDR.  If this definition applies, then \n\nthe adjustment to economic shocks will require changes to  prices  directly  since  the \n\nnominal  exchange  rate  cannot  adjust.    In  other  words,  the  real  exchange  rate \n\nmovements  required  to  move  the  economy  back  towards  equilibrium  following  any \n\neconomic  shock  will  have  to  be  induced  by  price  changes  rather  than  nominal \n\nexchange  rate  changes.    This  will  have  to  involve  changes  in  the  rewards  paid  to \n\nfactors of production, although it is most likely that nominal wages will have to bear \n\nthe brunt of this adjustment. \n\nIf the adjustment to economic shocks must occur through changes in nominal wages, \n\nrather than through changes in the nominal exchange rate, then this has a number of \n\nimplications for policy.  For one thing, there are likely to be nominal rigidities in labour \n\nmarkets that limit, or at least slow down, the adjustment to external shocks.  Even if \n\nthere  is  significant  unemployment  of  labour,  wages  rarely  adjust  quickly,  or  indeed \n\nfully,  to  demand-supply  imbalances.    There  might  also  be  an  asymmetry  in  the \n\nresponse of wages.  Depending on labour market conditions, and factors such as the \n\nlevel  and  strength  of  unionisation,  nominal  wages  may  be  rigid  downwards.    If \n\nnominal  wages  are  initially  close  to  subsistence  levels,  then  any  downward \n\nadjustment  in  response  to  an  external  shock  is  going  to  be  difficult.    Thus,  the \n\nadjustment  mechanism  that  requires  changes  in  wages  instead  of  changes  in \n\nnominal  exchange  rates  is  a  relatively  inefficient  instrument.    This  could  result  in \n\nsocial costs involving the increased unemployment of resources such as labour and \n\ncapital. \n\n \n\nEven  if  the  adjustment  occurs  through  reduction  in  prices,  the  deflation  associated \n\nwith the real exchange rate reduction could have other negative consequences.  The \n\n                                                            \n10 For a detailed discussion on the relationship between exchange rates and the prices of internationally \ntraded  goods,  see  Menon  (1996a,  b).    The  likely  impact  of  (various  definitions)  of  exchange  rate \nchanges on trade prices and trade flows in the Lao PDR context are discussed in Menon (1998a). \n\n\f   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ndeflation,  if  unexpected,  would  result  in  high  interest  rates  and  potentially  large \n\ntransfers from debtors to creditors.  The required deflation may also limit the extent to \n\nwhich real interest rates could fall to mitigate the reduction in real output. \n\nIf  the  more  relevant  exchange  rate  in  Lao  PDR  is  the  kip/baht  or  trade  weighted \n\nindex, then this implies that economic and financial conditions in its trading partners \n\nwill  be  the  main  determinant  of  Lao  PDR\u2019s  international  competitiveness.    In  this \n\ncase,  economic  and  financial  conditions  overseas,  rather  than  conditions  at  home, \n\nwill  determine  its  international  competitive  position.  Domestic  policy  autonomy  is \ngreatly compromised as a result.11 \n\nIt  should  be  noted  that,  irrespective  of  which  definition  of  the  exchange  rate  is \n\nrelevant,  exchange  rate  policy  is  not  an  effective  policy  option  for  Lao  PDR  in  the \n\npresence of the MCP.  Even if the exchange rate was not \u201cfixed\u201d, the loss in domestic \n\nautonomy  associated  with  the  trade-weighted  index  implies  that  any  discretionary \n\npower in conducting exchange rate policy is limited.  Another way of looking at this \n\nissue is to recognise that the inability of Bank of Lao PDR to conduct an independent \n\nmonetary policy (see Section 3.2) implies that it is pointless pursuing exchange rate \n\npolicy. \n\nAlthough  the  kip/US  dollar  exchange  rate  is  unlikely  to  affect  Lao  PDR\u2019s  terms  of \n\ntrade,  retail  prices  in  the  Lao  market  might  respond  to  changes  in  the  value  of  this \n\nrate.  Changes in the kip/US dollar exchange rate will affect the purchasing power of \nincomes depending on whether they are paid in kip or dollars.12 Over the recent past, \n\nthere has been a trend of depreciation of the kip against the dollar. If domestic prices \n\nare  determined  (or  fixed)  in  dollar  terms,  then  the  purchasing  power  of  workers  or \n\nowners  of  capital  receiving  their  wages/revenues  in  US  dollars  will  remain \n\nunchanged, whilst those of workers/capitalists receiving their incomes in kip will  fall \n\n(in  the  absence  of  indexation).  If  domestic  prices  are  set  in  terms  of  kip,  then  the \n\npurchasing power of workers or owners of capital receiving their wages/revenues in \n\nUS  dollars  will  increase,  whilst  that  of  workers/capitalists  receiving  their  incomes  in \n\nkip  will  remain  unchanged.    In  either  case,  income  distribution  is  likely  to  become \n\n                                                            \n11 Whilst  very  few  small  trading  nations  are  insulated  from  economic  and  financial  conditions  in  the \nglobal  economy,  the  situation  implied  by  this  exchange  rate  involves  close  to  no  domestic  autonomy \nwhatsoever.  The loss of autonomy is much greater than that implied by being \u201csmall\u201d in the international \ntrading sense.  \n12 This assumes that when wages are paid in kip, then they are also set in terms of kip. In Cambodia for \ninstance, government salaries are paid in the domestic currency, riel, even though they are actually set \n\n\f   \n \n\n \n\nmore unequal, favoring those paid in US dollars, than before the depreciation of the \n\nkip.    Thus,  the  MCP  may  be  contributing  to  increasing  inequality  in  the  size \n\ndistribution of income in Lao PDR.  \n\n4. Benefits of the MCP \n\n4.1 Inflation tax \n\nAn  issue  related  to  seigniorage,  and  which  operates  through  the  ability  of \n\ngovernments to issue money that is accepted by the public, is inflation tax.  Inflation \n\ntax,  which  is  a  hidden  tax,  results  in  a  redistribution  of  resources  away  from  the \n\npublic and towards the government (but without any net change in the economy as a \n\nwhole). The following example will illustrate the way inflation tax works.  Assume that \n\nLao PDR is free of the MCP, and kip is the only money used in the economy.  The \n\ngovernment decides to run a budget deficit, and chooses to finance it by the printing \n\nof money rather than by raising taxes.  In a kip economy, the government can now \n\npurchase additional goods and services without increasing taxes because it would be \n\nthe first to spend the money that it prints. Who then pays for the additional purchases \n\nof  the  government?  Citizens  that  hold  their  wealth  in  nominal  balances  will  pay  for \n\nthe  additional  purchases  of  the  government.    If  the  printing  of  money  results  in  a \n\ndoubling  of  the  money  supply,  say,  then  eventually  the  general  price  level  will  also \n\nhave  to  double.  Citizens  that  held  nominal  balances  will  find  that  their  purchasing \n\npower  has  halved  as  a  result  of  the  doubling  of  the  price  level.    In  an  economy \n\ncharacterised by the MCP such as Lao PDR, the capacity of governments to finance \n\nspending through inflation tax is limited.  The MCP, in this respect, imposes discipline \n\nby  limiting  the  ability  of  governments  to  finance  spending  through  the  printing  of \n\nmoney. It also avoids distributional or equity concerns associated with the impact of \n\ngovernment-induced  inflation  on  different  groups  in  society.    That  is,  citizens  who \n\nhold their wealth in nominal balances, or who have incomes that are not indexed to \n\nthe inflation rate, will be made worse-off relative to those on indexed incomes. \n\n \n\n4.2 Price effects \n\nFloating exchange rates have displayed a considerable amount of variability.  Variability \n\nis often discussed in terms of short-run volatility and medium to long-term misalignment \n\nof the currency.  The short-term volatility (sometimes on a day-to-day basis) and the \n\nmedium  to  long-term  misalignment  of  floating  exchange  rates  can  increase  the \n\nperceived  risk  associated  with  international  trade  and  investment  (see  Williamson \n\n                                                                                                                                                                          \nin terms of dollars (see Menon 1998b).  Like with prices, what really matters is the currency in which \nwages are set, rather than then currency in which they are paid. \n\n\f(1983); IMF (1984)).  Some of the benefits of a fixed exchange rate are conveyed in \n\na dollarised economy.  These include exchange rate and price stability. Thus, to the \n\nextent  that  domestic  and  international  transactions  are  conducted  using  the  same \n\ncurrency, the MCP dampens the effects of short-run volatility associated with floating \n\nexchange  rates  (it  does  not,  however,  deal  with  the  medium  to  long-term \n\nmisalignment  issue,  which  relates  to  its  role  as  an  adjustment  mechanism-  see \n\nSection 3.3). \n\n4.3 Larger stock of reserve currency \n\nThere are only a limited number of currencies that are freely accepted in payment for \n\ngoods  and  services  traded  internationally.    The  currency  of  countries  such  as  Lao \n\nPDR is not accepted in exchange for imported goods and services, or for repayment \n\nof  liabilities.    Indeed,  it  appears  that  even  Thai  traders  will  not  accept  kip  in  cross-\n\nborder trade.  More importantly, however, the kip is not convertible outside Lao PDR.  \n\nIn this context, the capacity to import is limited by export receipts and capital inflow.  \n\nThe MCP, however, alleviates this constraint to some extent.  With a stock of dollars \n\n(or  baht)  in  circulation,  the  liquidity  constraint  associated  with  hard  currency  is \n\nreduced  during  periods  of  low  exports  or  reductions in  capital  inflow.    Thus,  dollars \n\n(or baht) in the hands of the public could be used to finance imports during periods of \n\n   \n \n\n \n\ncrisis.   \n\n \n\nOn  the  other  hand,  however,  the  stock  of  foreign  currency  is  tied-up  in  serving  the \n\nfunction  of  domestic  money,  for  domestic  transactions,  on  a  day-to-day  basis.    As \n\ndiscussed earlier, there is a holding cost in the form of foregone earnings associated \n\nwith the use of foreign currency as the medium of exchange. Thus, on the whole, it is \n\nunclear  if  the  MCP  does  indeed  serve  as  a  safeguard  in  terms  of  the  capacity  to \n\nfinance  imports,  except  perhaps  during  periods  of  crisis  or  severe  shortage  of \n\nreserve  currency.    If  the  stock  of  foreign  currency  is  run  down  to  finance  imports \n\nduring a period of crisis, they will have to be built up again in the future in order to \n\ncontinue serving the function of a medium of exchange. If they are not built up again, \n\nthen  the  money  supply  will  contract  and  this  will  be  deflationary.  Thus,  the  MCP \n\nmight  allow,  at  best,  an  inter-temporal  trade-off  that  cushions  the  economy  during \n\nperiods of crisis, but that is all. \n\n \n\n5. Policy Responses to the MCP \n\nFrom  the  discussion  above,  it  would  appear  that  the  MCP  in  Lao  PDR  has  more \n\ncosts than benefits.  If this is the case, then how should Lao PDR go about reversing \n\n\f   \n \n\n \n\n \n\nthe MCP, or increasing the use of kip in the economy?  The only sustainable move \n\naway from the MCP and towards increased usage of kip must come from increased \n\nconfidence in the kip.  In this sense, the MCP in Lao PDR is not the problem, but is a \n\nsymptom.    The  problem,  or  the  cause,  is  a  lack  of  confidence  in  the  kip,  whilst  the \n\nsymptom,  of  the  effect,  is  the  use  of  another  currency  such  as  the  US  dollar.    The \n\ncauses  of  the  problem  emanate  from  an  underdeveloped  monetary  system, \n\nmacroeconomic  instability,  and  weak  legal  and  institutional  systems.    Furthermore, \n\nthe  lack  of  monetary  instruments  in  the  form  of  kip-denominated  interest-bearing \n\nassets further limits the use of kip as a store of value.  Most of these problems are \n\nlong-term in nature, and are characteristic of an economy in transition. When these \n\nproblems  are  addressed,  then  the  symptom  in  the  form  of  the  MCP  will  also \n\ndisappear.  To a certain degree, this is exactly what has happened in neighbouring \n\nViet Nam, where the use of the US dollar as a medium of exchange has diminished \n\nas  the  monetary  and  institutional  systems  have  developed  and  matured,  and  as \n\nmacroeconomic stability has been restored. \n\nWhat can be done to begin the process of reversing the MCP in the short to medium \n\nterm?  Should the government try and enforce the increased use of the kip? In other \n\nwords,  should  the  government  address  the  symptom  directly  in  the  hope  that  the \n\ncauses will diminish over time? The Lao PDR government has tried to do this in June \n\n1997, when the Bank of Lao moved to enforce the decree that stipulates that only the \n\nkip  could  be  used  as  a  medium  of  exchange  in  all  domestic  transactions  in  Lao \nPDR.13  \n\nThe  increased  policing  of  the  use  of  the  kip  almost  certainly  increased  its  use  in \n\ndomestic  transactions.    Nevertheless,  there  is  no  doubt  that  the  baht  and  dollar \n\ncontinued  to  be  used  in  domestic  transactions.    At  best,  this  enforcement  measure \n\nmight  have  increased  the  use  of  kip,  but  it  has  not  eliminated  the  use  of  other \n\ncurrencies  in  domestic  transactions.    It  is  also  unclear  if  this  enforcement  measure \n\nhas  increased  the  share  of  the  kip  in  the  money  stock.    It  is  claimed  that  the \n\nenforcement  measures  were  introduced  in  response  to  the  depreciation  of  the  kip \n\nagainst  both  the  baht  and  the  dollar  (and  concerns  regarding  an  increase  in  illegal \n\nblack  markets  dealings).    Instead  of  stemming  the  depreciation,  the  introduction  of \n\nthe  enforcement  measures  corresponded  with  further  depreciation  of  the  kip.  \n\nAlthough there could have been a number of factors causing the depreciation of the \n\n                                                            \n13 This  move  was  essentially  an  enforcement  measure,  as  Decree  No.  53,  dated  September  7,  1990, \nhad made it illegal to employ foreign currencies in domestic transactions. \n\n\f   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nkip,  it  would  appear  that  one  important  factor  was  the  uncertainty  associated  with, \n\nand  resultant  loss  of  confidence  in,  the  kip  after  the  enforcement  measures  were \n\nannounced.    Indeed,  the  kip  was  perhaps  the  only  currency  to  have  fallen  in  value \n\nagainst  the  baht  during  a  time  when  the  baht  was  depreciating  against  every  other \n\ncurrency (during the early phase of the Asian crisis).   \n\nThe  depreciation  of  the  kip  against  the  baht  and  the  dollar  since  the  enforcement \n\nmeasures were announced could have more than offset any increase in the volume \n\nof kip used in domestic transactions.  Thus, this policy of trying to force the use of the \n\nkip could have been counter-productive.  Rather than increase its value share in the \n\nmoney  stock,  enforced  usage  of  the  kip  may  have  lead  to  a  reduction  in  its  share \n\nfollowing depreciation in its value against other currencies.  It has also probably lead \n\nto  a  further  weakening  of  confidence  in  the  kip,  with  concerns  (irrespective  of  their \nvalidity) regarding future actions by the government.  \n\nTo  see  how  the  depreciation  of  the  kip  could  have  reduced  its  share  in  the  money \n\nstock, consider the following case.  Assume that the share of the kip in June 1997, \n\nprior  to  the  enforcement  measure,  was  50  percent  of  the  money  stock.    The  baht \n\nconstitutes 30 percent, and the remaining 20 percent are made up of US dollars.  For \n\nsimplicity, assume that the value of the money stock in June 1997, measured in US \n\ndollars, is equivalent to US$1 million.  That is, \n\nMoney stock  =  US$1 m  \n\n \n\n=   S(kip) (US$1 m) + S(baht) (US$1 m) + S(US$) (US$1 m) \n\n(4) \n\nWhere S(kip) = share of kip in the money stock = 0.5 \n\nS(baht) = share of baht in the money stock = 0.3 \n\nS(US$) = share of US dollars in the money stock = 0.2. \n\nBetween May 1997 and December  1997,  the kip depreciated  against  both  the  baht \n\nand the dollar.  The extent of the depreciation, based on average buy/sell rates in the \n\nparallel  market,  is  as  follows.    The  extent  of  the  depreciation  of  the  kip  against  the \n\nbaht  was  about  10.3  percent,  with  the  kip/baht  exchange  rate  changing  from  43.58 \n\nkip in May 1997 to 48.08 kip in December 1997. The extent of the depreciation of the \n\nkip  against  the  dollar,  on  the  other  hand,  was  about  82.3  percent,  with  the  kip/US \n\ndollar exchange rate changing from 1135 kip in May 1997 to 2069.5 kip in December \n\n1997.    How  did these  exchange  rate  movements  affect  the  shares  of  kip,  baht  and \n\n\f   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ndollars in the money stock?  Assuming no change in the volumes of the  respective \n\ncurrencies, the new shares (denoted as Sn) in the money stock are: \n\nSn(baht) \n\nSn(US$) \n\nSn(kip)  \n\n= \n\n= \n\n= \n\n0.3 (1.103) \n\n0.2 (1.823)   \n\n \n\n \n\n=  0.331 \n\n=  0.365 \n\n1  -  (0.331 + 0.365)   =  0.304 \n\nThus, the depreciation of the kip has resulted in its share in the money stock falling \n\nfrom 50 percent to about 30 percent.  While the kip used to have the highest share in \n\nthe money stock, the valuation effect from the depreciation has reduced it to having \n\nthe smallest share.  Due to the massive depreciation of the kip against the dollar, US \n\ndollars  now  have  the  highest  share  in  the  money  stock,  when  it  used  to  have  the \n\nsmallest  share.  To  the  extent  that  the  depreciation  was  caused  by  the  uncertainty \n\nintroduced by the enforcement measure, the outcome has been counter-productive.   \n\nTo return the share of the kip in the money stock to 50 percent, the usage of the kip \nwould  have  to  increase  by  about  65  percent.14 It  is  unlikely  that  the  enforcement \n\nmeasure  would  have  resulted  in  a  65  percent  increase  in  the  usage  of  the  kip.    It \n\nshould  be  noted,  however,  that  this  is  purely  an  illustrative  example.    Whilst  the \n\nmagnitudes of the changes in the relative shares of the currency may not be precise, \n\nthe overall direction of change would be accurate.  The magnitudes of the changes in \n\nthe relative shares of the currencies would also be affected by currency substitution \n\neffects.    For  instance,  discussions  with  Lao  officials  indicate  that  there  has  been  a \n\nsubstitution away from both baht and kip and towards the dollar after the depreciation \n\nof both currencies following the Asian crisis.  Although the baht continued to be used \n\nin cross-border trade along the Mekong, there had been some shift away from baht \n\nand towards dollars following large fluctuations in the relative value of the baht in the \n\naftermath of 1997 crisis.  These currency  substitution  effects  are  likely  to  affect  the \n\nrelative shares of baht and dollars in the money stock; they are unlikely to affect the \n\nshare of kip in the money stock to any significant extent. \n\nImposing  or  forcing  the  use  of  the  kip  is  not  the  answer.    Perhaps  the  best  way  of \n\nreducing  the  use  of  foreign  currencies  in  Lao  PDR  is  to  reduce  the  distinctions \n\nbetween the kip and these currencies.  Enforcing the use of kip is likely to add to the \n\ndistinctions, or perceived differences, rather than reducing them.  If citizens are given \n\n                                                            \n14 That is, {(0.5 - 0.303) / 0.303} x 100 = 65 percent. \n\n\f   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthe  free  choice  to  use  kip,  baht  or  dollars  in  any  and  all  transactions,  then  the \n\nperceived differences between the two are likely to slowly diminish over time.   \n\nReducing  the  distinction  between  the  currencies  will  involve,  as  a  fundamental \n\nrequirement,  the  assurance  that  kip can  be  converted  into  dollars  freely  and  in  any \n\nquantity.    With  the  current  situation,  where  confidence  in  the  kip  is  low,  this  policy \n\nwould  effectively  limit  the  government  to  issuing  kip  on  an  almost  one-to-one  basis \n\nwith foreign reserves. It could  be argued  that  the  present  stock  of  kip,  estimated  at \n\nabout 50 percent of the money supply, currently reflects this aspect of convertibility \n\nalready.   Thus,  the  transition  from  an  economy  characterised  by  the  MCP  to  a  kip-\n\nbased economy will depend on the willingness of Lao PDR\u2019s citizens to hold the kip.  \n\nThis  willingness  will  require  an  assurance  of  free  convertibility  initially,  and \n\nconfidence in the value of the kip eventually.  In the interim, however, measures that \n\nimpose  the  use  of  kip  should  be  removed  in  an  attempt  to  reduce  the  distinctions, \n\nwhether perceived or real, between the currencies. We cannot escape the conclusion \n\nhowever that the root causes of the MCP will need to be addressed directly, and that \n\nthere is no other long-term solution to dealing with its implications. \n\n6. Summary \n\nThe multiple currency phenomenon (MCP) in Lao PDR takes the form of the use of \n\nforeign currencies such as dollars and baht in the presence of a domestically issued \n\ncurrency. The MCP appears to have more costs than benefits.  These costs include \n\nthe  social  loss  associated  with  seigniorage,  the  inability  to  conduct  an  independent \n\nmonetary  policy  and  the  relative  ineffectiveness  of  the  exchange  rate  as  an \n\nadjustment  mechanism. The  benefits of  the  MCP  include  the  discipline  imposed  on \n\nthe  government  by  significantly  limiting  its  capacity  to  finance  spending  through \n\ninflation tax, and the stability and certainty induced by an effectively fixed exchange \n\nrate.  Having  a  stock  of  dollars  or  baht  in  circulation  is  sometimes  viewed  as  a \n\nsignificant  benefit  of  the  MCP.  At  best,  it  can  act  as  a  cushion  that  alleviates  the \n\nshort-term effects of a crisis; but that is all. \n\nIn  June  1997,  the  Bank  of  Lao  PDR  moved  to  enforce  Decree  No.  53,  which \n\nstipulates that only the kip could be used as a medium of exchange in all domestic \n\ntransactions.    This  move  would  reflect  the  Government\u2019s  view  that  the  costs  of  the \n\nMCP exceed the benefits. Is enforcement the solution to overcoming the MCP? Any \n\nenforced measure is likely to be counter-productive, as it will increase the perceived \n\n                                                                                                                                                                          \n \n\n\f   \n \n\n \n\ndifferences between the currencies, rather than reduce them.  Enforcement does not \n\naddress the underlying problem of a lack of confidence in the kip.  Although it might \n\nbe possible to increase the use of the kip in domestic transactions through increased \n\npolicing, any such increase could be reversed by depreciation of the kip.  Since the \n\nenforcement measures have been in place, the kip has depreciated to such an extent \n\nthat  its  share  in  the  money  stock  has  fallen.    Indeed,  the  share  of  the  kip  in  the \n\nmoney  stock  following  the  enforcement  measures  resulted  in  it  being  lower  than  it \n\nhas ever been, and lower than the shares of dollars or baht in the money stock. \n\nThe long-term solution to the MCP does not lie with imposing the use of the kip.  This \n\nis because the MCP is not the problem, but is merely a symptom.  The problem (or \n\nthe cause) is a lack of confidence in the kip, whilst the symptom (or the effect) is the \n\nuse  of  another  currency  such  as  the  dollar  or  baht.    The  causes  of  the  problem \n\nemanate from an underdeveloped monetary system, macroeconomic instability, and \n\nweak  legal  and  institutional  systems.  These  are  the  problems  that  need  to  be \n\naddressed directly.  When these problems are addressed, then the symptom, which \n\nis the MCP, will also cease to be a constraint.   \n\n\f   \n \n\nReferences \nBerg,  Andrew  and  Eduardo  Borensztein  (2000)  \u201cThe  Pros  and  Cons  of  Full \nDollarization\u201d, Working Paper 00/50, Washington, D.C.: International Monetary Fund. \n \nBruno,  Michael  (1993)  Crisis,  Stabilization  and  Economic  Reform:  Therapy  by \nConsensus, Oxford: Clarendon Press. \n \n\nCalvo, Guillermo A.

When these problems are addressed, \nthen the symptom, which is the MCP, will also cease to be a constraint.   \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "   \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "1.
