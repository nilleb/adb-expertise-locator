The MCP has both costs and benefits.  The costs include the social loss \nassociated with seigniorage, the inability to conduct an independent monetary policy \nand the relative ineffectiveness of the exchange rate as an adjustment mechanism. \nThe benefits of the MCP include the discipline imposed on the government by limiting \nits capacity to finance spending through inflation tax, and the stability and certainty \ninduced by an effectively fixed exchange rate. Since the costs appear to exceed the \nbenefits, how should the Government of Lao PDR respond? Enforcing the use of the \nkip is not the answer, and may well be counter-productive.  This is because the MCP \nis not the problem, but is merely a symptom.  The problem is a lack of confidence in \nthe kip, whilst the symptom is the use of another currency such as the dollar or baht.  \nThe causes of the problem emanate from an underdeveloped monetary system, \nmacroeconomic instability, and weak legal and institutional systems. These are the \nproblems that need to be addressed directly.  When these problems are addressed, \nthen the symptom, which is the MCP, will also cease to be a constraint.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  \n \n1. Introduction \nThe  monetary  situation  in  most  transitional  economies  is  characterised  by  the \nmultiple  currency  phenomenon  (MCP).    Generally,  the  MCP  takes  the  form  of \ndollarization. Dollarization is defined as the widespread use of the US dollar as a \nmedium of exchange and a store of value in the presence of the national currency.  \nLao PDR provides an almost unique case study of the MCP. This is because there \nare two foreign currencies, the US dollar and Thai baht, which are widely used as a \nsubstitute for the national currency, kip.  The impacts of the MCP a la the Lao case \nare more complex than dollarization, and not very well understood.1 Furthermore, the \nliterature  has  ignored  the  experience  of  the  Asian  transitional  economies,  and \nfocussed on the experience of the Latin American and South American countries.2 In \nthis paper, we try and overcome this knowledge gap through a careful analysis of the \nimplications of the MCP in Lao PDR.  What are the costs and benefits of the MCP?  \nWhat policy should the Government pursue, if any, in responding to the MCP?  \nThese are some of the questions that we address in this paper. \n \nWe begin in Section 2 by considering what the MCP means.  In Section 3, we assess \nthe potential costs of the MCP, while Section 4 looks at the potential benefits of the \nMCP.  Policy responses to the MCP are the subject of Section 5.  Here we also \nassess the efficacy of the Government\u2019s policy of trying to increase the use of kip \nthrough enforcement measures.  A final section concludes. \n \n2. What is the Multiple Currency Phenomenon (MCP)? \nThe literature on the use of multiple currencies in a domestic economy distinguishes \nbetween two concepts: currency substitution and dollarization (see, for instance, \nSahay  and  Vegh  (1995);  Calvo  and  Vegh  (1995);  Bruno  (1993)).    Currency \nsubstitution is defined as the use of a foreign currency as a medium of exchange in \nthe domestic economy.  Dollarization is defined as the use of a foreign currency as a \nmedium of exchange and a store of value in the presence of a domestically issued \ncurrency.  Thus, dollarization encompasses currency substitution but extends it to \ninclude the store of value function.3 \n \n                                                            \n1 The range of substitution possibilities following movements in cross-rates for instance is greater than \nwhen only one foreign currency is used in the presence of the domestically issued currency. \n2 See, for instance, Salvatore et al. (2003), Berg and Borensztein (2000), and Sahay and Vegh (1995). \n3 Neither of these two definitions explicitly refers to the unit of account function of money.  Nevertheless, \nsince both definitions refer to the medium of exchange function, the unit of account function is implied in \nboth cases. ", "  \n \nThe situation in Lao PDR is unique in that it does not fit into either the dollarization \ndefinition  or  the  currency  substitution  definition,  since  there  are  two  foreign \ncurrencies that are used domestically.  In addition to the Thai baht and the US dollar, \nthe dong and the yuan are also used in cross-border trade in the provinces that \nborder Viet Nam and Yunnan, but only as a medium of exchange.  Both the baht and \ndollar serve all the three functions of money in Lao PDR: they are widely used as a \nmedium of exchange, store of wealth and unit of account.  Thus, although the \nsituation in Lao is more complicated than that implied by dollarization, it is closer to \nthis definition than it is to currency substitution.  The kip also serves all the three \nfunctions of money, but its use as a store of wealth is arguably less significant than \nwith the foreign currencies.  \n \n3. Costs of the MCP \n3.1 Seigniorage \nThe first and perhaps most significant cost of the MCP is the loss in \u201cseigniorage\u201d by \nthe national monetary authority. Basically, seigniorage is the difference between the \nface value of currency and the cost of producing it. The ability of governments to \nissue token or paper money generates a very large social saving in the use of \nresources.4 There are both stock and flow components associated with the social \ncost of the MCP.  We begin by considering the costs emanating from the stock \ncomponent. \n \nSeigniorage: the stock component \nThe stock component can be best understood by looking at how the dollars or baht \nwere brought into circulation.  Every baht and dollar note currently in circulation in \nLao PDR, apart from unilateral transfers in the form of aid flows, was obtained by \nexchanging goods, services, or claims on assets, equivalent to the face value of the \nstock of foreign currency in circulation. Thus, the seigniorage does not accrue to Lao \nPDR, but only to the issuing agency (in this case Thailand and the US).  \n \nThere is also a flow aspect related to the stock component in the form of holding \ncost. The holding cost associated with the current stock of baht and dollars used for \ntransaction purposes is the income foregone on interest-bearing assets.  This is the \nincome that could have been earned if the stock of foreign currency currently held for \n                                                            \n4 During the Gold standard for instance, this saving resulted from resources that would otherwise have \nto be expended in mining and smelting large quantities of metal such as gold.  Similarly, the MCP \ndeprives governments of this social saving to a large extent. ", "  \n \ntransactions purposes was invested in income-bearing assets such as bank deposits \nor  bonds.5 The  interest  foregone  on  holding  domestically  issued  currency  for \ntransaction purposes has no net effect on the domestic economy; it only has a \ndistributional effect within the economy.  That is, there is a transfer between citizens, \nbut no net change in overall income or welfare.6 \n \nSeigniorage: the flow component \nIf the stock component of seigniorage involved a one-off process of recouping the \nbaht and dollars currently held for transaction purposes, then the costs associated \nwith the flow component relate to the demand for money over time.  With economic \ngrowth, there will be an increasing demand for money for transaction purposes.7  To \nincrease the stock of baht and dollars in Lao PDR, there must again be an exchange \nof goods, services, or claims on assets, which take place to bring the additional \nforeign currency into the country.  In effect, Lao PDR will have to run a balance of \npayments surplus in order to increase its money supply.   \n \nIt would be easier to understand the flow component if we thought of the benefits of \nbeing rid of the MCP, rather than the costs of the MCP. Consider a case where Lao \nPDR\u2019s GDP grows by 6 percent in a given year.  Assume further that as a result the \ntransactions demand for money also increases by 6 percent.  Without the MCP, this \nwould mean that the government could run a budget deficit (or reduce its budget \nsurplus) by 6 percent without increasing inflation.  That is, the growth in the economy \nallows the government to finance the budget deficit, or reduce the budget surplus, \nthrough the printing of money in a non-inflationary way.  Indeed, without the MCP, \nthe Lao PDR government could increase its budget deficit or reduce its budget \nsurplus by the amount of the increase in transactions demand for money simply \nthrough the printing of money and without any increase in inflationary pressures.   \n \n                                                            \n5 Note that this holding cost applies only in the case where a foreign currency is used to serve the \nfunction of domestic money.  The holding cost does not apply when the domestically issued currency is \nheld for transaction purposes.  This is because there is no, or little, cost associated with meeting the \ntransactions demand for domestically issued money.  The Central Bank could simply print the amounts \nrequired for transaction purposes, and the only cost incurred in this instance is the cost of printing \nmoney (rather than the cost equal to the face value of the money). \n6 To illustrate, consider the current situation in Lao PDR.  If kip is held for transaction purposes, then the \nnet effect (in terms of interest foregone) is zero because kip cannot be invested in banks or bonds \noverseas.  If it could, then there would be a net inflow of income to the Lao economy (which is equivalent \nto the income foregone by not investing the kip overseas). If US dollars are held for transaction \npurposes, then the net effect (in terms of interest foregone) is equivalent to the income foregone by not \ninvesting the US dollars in banks or bonds overseas. \n7 In theory, the demand for money should decrease over time as financial development results in a \nreduced need for currency to effect transactions.  Given the low level of development of the financial \nsystem in Lao PDR, this is unlikely to happen for some time. ", "  \n \nIn an economy with only foreign currencies in use, on the other hand, the increase in \nthe transactions demand for money caused by economic growth can only be met by \na balance of payments surplus.  That is, there must be an increase in the stock of \ndollars or baht in circulation equivalent to the increase in the transactions demand for \nmoney.  If this increased demand for transactions balances cannot be met, then it is \nlikely to be deflationary.  Meeting this increased demand for transaction balances \ninvolves a waste of resources equivalent to the loss in seigniorage. \n \nThe current situation in Lao PDR: impacts of stocks and flows \nThe kip is estimated to constitute about 50 percent of the money stock in Lao PDR.  \nThe baht is estimated at 30 percent, and dollars apparently make up the remaining \n20 percent of the money stock.8  In this situation, the difference between the face \nvalue of this stock of kip, and the cost of producing it, is social saving in the form of \nseigniorage. Indeed, if the government exercises monetary discipline and increases \nthe stock of kip by a percentage equivalent to GDP growth times the share of kip in \nthe money stock, then it will earn seigniorage on these new notes on a continuing \nbasis. If GDP growth is 6 percent, and transactions demand for money increases by \n6 percent, then the government can print money in a non-inflationary manner (and \nearn seigniorage) in the amount of: \n    0.5   x   0.06  x   the money stock;        (1) \nwhere 0.5 = the share of kip in the money stock \nand  0.06  =  the  growth  in  transactions  demand for  money  (driven  by  economic \ngrowth). \n \nWhat if the share of kip in the money stock could be increased over time from 50 \npercent to 60 percent, for instance?  Using the example above, we can see how \nincreasing the use of kip in the economy could result in quite substantial social gains \nfrom seigniorage.  The gains will come from both the stock and flow components.  \nThe stock component implies that about 10 percent of the foreign currencies in \ncirculation can be exchanged, in a one-off recouping transaction, for goods, services \netc., since these notes will no longer be required for the medium of exchange \nfunction. Lao PDR will be able to recoup the original cost incurred in obtaining the \nstock of baht and dollars in circulation. \n \nThe one-off benefit from the stock component will equal: \n    0.2  x   0.5  x   the money stock;        (2) ", "  \n \nwhere 0.2 = the percentage increase (0.1/0.5) in the share of kip from 50 percent to \n60 percent \n          0.5 = the original share of foreign currency in the money stock. \n \nThe benefits from the flow component will equal: \n    0.6   x   0.06  x   the money stock;        (3) \nwhere 0.6 = the new share of kip in the money stock \nand  0.06  =  the  growth  in  transactions  demand for  money  (driven  by  economic \ngrowth). \n \nThis  benefit  from  the  flow  component  can  be  earned  on  an  on-going  basis.  \nIncreasing the share of kip in the money stock over time will continue to yield social \ngains  from  both  the  stock  and  flow  components.    The  gains  from  the  stock \ncomponent will cease when Lao PDR is completely free of the MCP.  The gains from \nthe flow component will accrue indefinitely, as long as the transactions demand for \nmoney  grows  with  economic  growth,  and  the  government  exercises  monetary \ndiscipline. \n \n3.2 Monetary Policy and Lender of Last Resort Function \nThe effective conduct of monetary policy in Lao PDR is impaired by the MCP and a \nweak financial system. Of course the MCP and a weak financial system are two \nlimitations that are inter-related.  The MCP is a reflection of a weak financial system, \namong other things. \n \nThe MCP impairs the ability of the Bank of Lao PDR to conduct an independent \nmonetary policy. This is because capital inflows or outflows automatically change the \nmoney supply when a foreign currency can be used as a medium of exchange.  An \noutflow of baht or dollars contracts the money supply, whilst an inflow would expand \nit.  An outflow of baht or dollars could be deflationary, whilst an inflow could be \ninflationary.   \n \nThe impact of these movements of capital on the money supply and domestic activity \ncould be offset if the Bank of Lao PDR could conduct open market operations, for \ninstance. The lack of monetary instruments in the form of kip-denominated interest-\nbearing assets prevents the Bank of Lao from conducting open market operations.  \nEven if the Bank of Lao could issue kip-denominated interest-bearing assets, the lack \n                                                                                                                                                                          \n8  This estimate is provided by the Bank of Lao PDR.    ", "  \n \nof confidence in the kip would limit their subscription.  Other monetary instruments \nsuch as changes to the reserve requirement are likely to be blunt instruments of \nmonetary policy because the MCP allows capital inflows to become part of the \nmoney  stock  without  passing-through  the  financial  system.    Thus,  the  ability  to \nconduct  an  independent  monetary  policy  depends  on  addressing  the  MCP  and \nimproving the financial system. \n \nThe lender of last resort function of the Bank of Lao PDR is also somewhat impaired \nby the MCP.  In the case of a generalized loss of confidence in the banking system, \nthe monetary authorities would not be able to guarantee the whole payments system \nor to fully back bank deposits.  The ability to print money as required is, after all, what \nallows a central bank to fully guarantee that all claims in domestic currency will be \nmet.  The MCP reduces the capacity of the central bank to print money, and thus \nalso impairs its ability to perform its function as guarantor and lender of last resort.9 \n \n3.3 The Exchange Rate Mechanism and Policy \nThe MCP complicates the definition and measurement of the exchange rate in Lao \nPDR. There are three possible definitions of the nominal exchange rate that we \nconsider: (i) the kip/US dollar exchange rate; (ii) the kip/baht exchange rate; and (iii) \na \u201cno exchange rate\u201d case.  First we consider the circumstances under which each of \nthese definitions might apply, and then we examine the implications that follow from \neach. \n \nThe kip/US dollar exchange rate is our benchmark definition, and is the exchange \nrate that would be most relevant in the absence of the MCP.  Accordingly, it is also \nperhaps the least relevant definition in Lao PDR at present given the MCP. The \nkip/baht exchange rate is the closest (bilateral) proxy to a trade-weighted exchange \nrate in Lao PDR.  This is because most of Lao PDR\u2019s trade is conducted with \nThailand.  Again, this exchange rate is less important in Lao PDR than it would have \nbeen in the absence of the MCP.  Finally, we have the \u201cno exchange rate\u201d case.  The \nMCP  could  produce  an  outcome  similar  to  that  of  having  a  permanently  fixed \nexchange rate.  How could such a situation arise? If prices charged by exporters to \nLao PDR are set in dollars (or baht), and the prices of these goods in the domestic \nmarket are also set in dollars (or baht), then movements in the value of the kip/US \n                                                            \n9 Calvo\u2019s (2000) qualification that domestic banks can have access to liquidity through sources other \nthan the printing press of the central bank does not apply in the case of Lao PDR because of its weak \nfinancial system. ", "  \n \ndollar exchange rate, the kip/baht exchange rate, or any other definition of the \nexchange rate do not enter into the pricing decision of imports in the Lao PDR \nmarket.  Similarly, if prices of Lao PDR\u2019s exports are determined in world markets in \nUS dollar terms, or in terms of baht, then any movements in the exchange rates \ndescribed above will not affect prices.10  In these situations, even the term \u201cexchange \nrate\u201d is a misnomer because trade occurs as if without an exchange rate. \n  \nWe begin by considering the implications of \u201cno exchange rate\u201d definition because it \nis likely to be the most relevant in the case of Lao PDR.  If this definition applies, then \nthe adjustment to economic shocks will require changes to prices directly since the \nnominal  exchange  rate  cannot  adjust.    In  other  words,  the  real  exchange  rate \nmovements required to move the economy back towards equilibrium following any \neconomic  shock  will  have  to  be  induced by price changes rather than nominal \nexchange rate changes.  This will have to involve changes in the rewards paid to \nfactors of production, although it is most likely that nominal wages will have to bear \nthe brunt of this adjustment. \n \nIf the adjustment to economic shocks must occur through changes in nominal wages, \nrather than through changes in the nominal exchange rate, then this has a number of \nimplications for policy.  For one thing, there are likely to be nominal rigidities in labour \nmarkets that limit, or at least slow down, the adjustment to external shocks.  Even if \nthere is significant unemployment of labour, wages rarely adjust quickly, or indeed \nfully, to demand-supply imbalances.  There might also be an asymmetry in the \nresponse of wages.  Depending on labour market conditions, and factors such as the \nlevel  and  strength  of  unionisation,  nominal  wages  may  be rigid downwards.  If \nnominal  wages  are  initially  close  to  subsistence  levels,  then  any  downward \nadjustment in response to an external shock is going to be difficult.  Thus, the \nadjustment  mechanism  that  requires  changes  in  wages  instead  of  changes  in \nnominal exchange rates is a relatively inefficient instrument.  This could result in \nsocial costs involving the increased unemployment of resources such as labour and \ncapital. \n \nEven if the adjustment occurs through reduction in prices, the deflation associated \nwith the real exchange rate reduction could have other negative consequences.  The \n                                                            \n10 For a detailed discussion on the relationship between exchange rates and the prices of internationally \ntraded goods, see Menon (1996a, b).  The likely impact of (various definitions) of exchange rate \nchanges on trade prices and trade flows in the Lao PDR context are discussed in Menon (1998a). ", "  \n \ndeflation, if unexpected, would result in high interest rates and potentially large \ntransfers from debtors to creditors.  The required deflation may also limit the extent to \nwhich real interest rates could fall to mitigate the reduction in real output. \n \nIf the more relevant exchange rate in Lao PDR is the kip/baht or trade weighted \nindex, then this implies that economic and financial conditions in its trading partners \nwill be the main determinant of Lao PDR\u2019s international competitiveness.  In this \ncase, economic and financial conditions overseas, rather than conditions at home, \nwill determine its international competitive position. Domestic policy autonomy is \ngreatly compromised as a result.11 \n \nIt should be noted that, irrespective of which definition of the exchange rate is \nrelevant, exchange rate policy is not an effective policy option for Lao PDR in the \npresence of the MCP.  Even if the exchange rate was not \u201cfixed\u201d, the loss in domestic \nautonomy associated with the trade-weighted index implies that any discretionary \npower in conducting exchange rate policy is limited.  Another way of looking at this \nissue is to recognise that the inability of Bank of Lao PDR to conduct an independent \nmonetary policy (see Section 3.2) implies that it is pointless pursuing exchange rate \npolicy. \n \nAlthough the kip/US dollar exchange rate is unlikely to affect Lao PDR\u2019s terms of \ntrade, retail prices in the Lao market might respond to changes in the value of this \nrate.  Changes in the kip/US dollar exchange rate will affect the purchasing power of \nincomes depending on whether they are paid in kip or dollars.12 Over the recent past, \nthere has been a trend of depreciation of the kip against the dollar. If domestic prices \nare determined (or fixed) in dollar terms, then the purchasing power of workers or \nowners  of  capital  receiving  their  wages/revenues  in  US  dollars  will  remain \nunchanged, whilst those of workers/capitalists receiving their incomes in kip will fall \n(in the absence of indexation). If domestic prices are set in terms of kip, then the \npurchasing power of workers or owners of capital receiving their wages/revenues in \nUS dollars will increase, whilst that of workers/capitalists receiving their incomes in \nkip will remain unchanged.  In either case, income distribution is likely to become \n                                                            \n11 Whilst very few small trading nations are insulated from economic and financial conditions in the \nglobal economy, the situation implied by this exchange rate involves close to no domestic autonomy \nwhatsoever.  The loss of autonomy is much greater than that implied by being \u201csmall\u201d in the international \ntrading sense.  \n12 This assumes that when wages are paid in kip, then they are also set in terms of kip. In Cambodia for \ninstance, government salaries are paid in the domestic currency, riel, even though they are actually set ", "  \n \nmore unequal, favoring those paid in US dollars, than before the depreciation of the \nkip.    Thus,  the  MCP  may  be  contributing  to  increasing  inequality  in  the  size \ndistribution of income in Lao PDR.  \n \n4. Benefits of the MCP \n4.1 Inflation tax \nAn  issue  related  to  seigniorage,  and  which  operates  through  the  ability  of \ngovernments to issue money that is accepted by the public, is inflation tax.  Inflation \ntax, which is a hidden tax, results in a redistribution of resources away from the \npublic and towards the government (but without any net change in the economy as a \nwhole). The following example will illustrate the way inflation tax works.  Assume that \nLao PDR is free of the MCP, and kip is the only money used in the economy.  The \ngovernment decides to run a budget deficit, and chooses to finance it by the printing \nof money rather than by raising taxes.  In a kip economy, the government can now \npurchase additional goods and services without increasing taxes because it would be \nthe first to spend the money that it prints. Who then pays for the additional purchases \nof the government? Citizens that hold their wealth in nominal balances will pay for \nthe additional purchases of the government.  If the printing of money results in a \ndoubling of the money supply, say, then eventually the general price level will also \nhave to double. Citizens that held nominal balances will find that their purchasing \npower has halved as a result of the doubling of the price level.  In an economy \ncharacterised by the MCP such as Lao PDR, the capacity of governments to finance \nspending through inflation tax is limited.  The MCP, in this respect, imposes discipline \nby limiting the ability of governments to finance spending through the printing of \nmoney. It also avoids distributional or equity concerns associated with the impact of \ngovernment-induced inflation on different groups in society.  That is, citizens who \nhold their wealth in nominal balances, or who have incomes that are not indexed to \nthe inflation rate, will be made worse-off relative to those on indexed incomes. \n \n4.2 Price effects \nFloating exchange rates have displayed a considerable amount of variability.  Variability \nis often discussed in terms of short-run volatility and medium to long-term misalignment \nof the currency.  The short-term volatility (sometimes on a day-to-day basis) and the \nmedium  to  long-term  misalignment  of  floating  exchange  rates  can  increase  the \nperceived risk associated with international trade and investment (see Williamson \n                                                                                                                                                                          \nin terms of dollars (see Menon 1998b).  Like with prices, what really matters is the currency in which \nwages are set, rather than then currency in which they are paid. ", "  \n \n(1983); IMF (1984)).  Some of the benefits of a fixed exchange rate are conveyed in \na dollarised economy.  These include exchange rate and price stability. Thus, to the \nextent that domestic and international transactions are conducted using the same \ncurrency, the MCP dampens the effects of short-run volatility associated with floating \nexchange  rates  (it  does  not,  however,  deal  with  the  medium  to  long-term \nmisalignment issue, which relates to its role as an adjustment mechanism- see \nSection 3.3). \n \n4.3 Larger stock of reserve currency \nThere are only a limited number of currencies that are freely accepted in payment for \ngoods and services traded internationally.  The currency of countries such as Lao \nPDR is not accepted in exchange for imported goods and services, or for repayment \nof liabilities.  Indeed, it appears that even Thai traders will not accept kip in cross-\nborder trade.  More importantly, however, the kip is not convertible outside Lao PDR.  \nIn this context, the capacity to import is limited by export receipts and capital inflow.  \nThe MCP, however, alleviates this constraint to some extent.  With a stock of dollars \n(or  baht)  in  circulation,  the  liquidity  constraint  associated  with  hard  currency  is \nreduced during periods of low exports or reductions in capital inflow.  Thus, dollars \n(or baht) in the hands of the public could be used to finance imports during periods of \ncrisis.   \n \nOn the other hand, however, the stock of foreign currency is tied-up in serving the \nfunction of domestic money, for domestic transactions, on a day-to-day basis.  As \ndiscussed earlier, there is a holding cost in the form of foregone earnings associated \nwith the use of foreign currency as the medium of exchange. Thus, on the whole, it is \nunclear if the MCP does indeed serve as a safeguard in terms of the capacity to \nfinance  imports,  except  perhaps  during  periods  of  crisis  or  severe  shortage  of \nreserve currency.  If the stock of foreign currency is run down to finance imports \nduring a period of crisis, they will have to be built up again in the future in order to \ncontinue serving the function of a medium of exchange. If they are not built up again, \nthen the money supply will contract and this will be deflationary. Thus, the MCP \nmight allow, at best, an inter-temporal trade-off that cushions the economy during \nperiods of crisis, but that is all. \n \n5. Policy Responses to the MCP \nFrom the discussion above, it would appear that the MCP in Lao PDR has more \ncosts than benefits.  If this is the case, then how should Lao PDR go about reversing ", "  \n \nthe MCP, or increasing the use of kip in the economy?  The only sustainable move \naway from the MCP and towards increased usage of kip must come from increased \nconfidence in the kip.  In this sense, the MCP in Lao PDR is not the problem, but is a \nsymptom.  The problem, or the cause, is a lack of confidence in the kip, whilst the \nsymptom, of the effect, is the use of another currency such as the US dollar.  The \ncauses  of  the  problem  emanate  from  an  underdeveloped  monetary  system, \nmacroeconomic instability, and weak legal and institutional systems.  Furthermore, \nthe lack of monetary instruments in the form of kip-denominated interest-bearing \nassets further limits the use of kip as a store of value.  Most of these problems are \nlong-term in nature, and are characteristic of an economy in transition. When these \nproblems  are  addressed,  then  the  symptom  in  the  form  of  the  MCP  will  also \ndisappear.  To a certain degree, this is exactly what has happened in neighbouring \nViet Nam, where the use of the US dollar as a medium of exchange has diminished \nas the monetary and institutional systems have developed and matured, and as \nmacroeconomic stability has been restored. \n \nWhat can be done to begin the process of reversing the MCP in the short to medium \nterm?  Should the government try and enforce the increased use of the kip? In other \nwords, should the government address the symptom directly in the hope that the \ncauses will diminish over time? The Lao PDR government has tried to do this in June \n1997, when the Bank of Lao moved to enforce the decree that stipulates that only the \nkip could be used as a medium of exchange in all domestic transactions in Lao \nPDR.13  \n \nThe increased policing of the use of the kip almost certainly increased its use in \ndomestic transactions.  Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the baht and dollar \ncontinued to be used in domestic transactions.  At best, this enforcement measure \nmight have increased the use of kip, but it has not eliminated the use of other \ncurrencies in domestic transactions.  It is also unclear if this enforcement measure \nhas increased the share of the kip in the money stock.  It is claimed that the \nenforcement measures were introduced in response to the depreciation of the kip \nagainst both the baht and the dollar (and concerns regarding an increase in illegal \nblack markets dealings).  Instead of stemming the depreciation, the introduction of \nthe  enforcement  measures  corresponded  with  further  depreciation  of  the  kip.  \nAlthough there could have been a number of factors causing the depreciation of the \n                                                            \n13 This move was essentially an enforcement measure, as Decree No. 53, dated September 7, 1990, \nhad made it illegal to employ foreign currencies in domestic transactions. ", "  \n \nkip, it would appear that one important factor was the uncertainty associated with, \nand resultant loss of confidence in, the kip after the enforcement measures were \nannounced.  Indeed, the kip was perhaps the only currency to have fallen in value \nagainst the baht during a time when the baht was depreciating against every other \ncurrency (during the early phase of the Asian crisis).   \n \nThe depreciation of the kip against the baht and the dollar since the enforcement \nmeasures were announced could have more than offset any increase in the volume \nof kip used in domestic transactions.  Thus, this policy of trying to force the use of the \nkip could have been counter-productive.  Rather than increase its value share in the \nmoney stock, enforced usage of the kip may have lead to a reduction in its share \nfollowing depreciation in its value against other currencies.  It has also probably lead \nto a further weakening of confidence in the kip, with concerns (irrespective of their \nvalidity) regarding future actions by the government.  \n \nTo see how the depreciation of the kip could have reduced its share in the money \nstock, consider the following case.  Assume that the share of the kip in June 1997, \nprior to the enforcement measure, was 50 percent of the money stock.  The baht \nconstitutes 30 percent, and the remaining 20 percent are made up of US dollars.  For \nsimplicity, assume that the value of the money stock in June 1997, measured in US \ndollars, is equivalent to US$1 million.  That is, \n \nMoney stock  =  US$1 m  \n    =   S(kip) (US$1 m) + S(baht) (US$1 m) + S(US$) (US$1 m)  (4) \n \nWhere S(kip) = share of kip in the money stock = 0.5 \nS(baht) = share of baht in the money stock = 0.3 \nS(US$) = share of US dollars in the money stock = 0.2. \n \nBetween May 1997 and December 1997, the kip depreciated against both the baht \nand the dollar.  The extent of the depreciation, based on average buy/sell rates in the \nparallel market, is as follows.  The extent of the depreciation of the kip against the \nbaht was about 10.3 percent, with the kip/baht exchange rate changing from 43.58 \nkip in May 1997 to 48.08 kip in December 1997. The extent of the depreciation of the \nkip against the dollar, on the other hand, was about 82.3 percent, with the kip/US \ndollar exchange rate changing from 1135 kip in May 1997 to 2069.5 kip in December \n1997.  How did these exchange rate movements affect the shares of kip, baht and ", "  \n \ndollars in the money stock?  Assuming no change in the volumes of the respective \ncurrencies, the new shares (denoted as S ) in the money stock are: \nn\n \nS (baht)  =  0.3 (1.103)    =  0.331 \nn\nS (US$)  =  0.2 (1.823)      =  0.365 \nn\nS (kip)   =  1  -  (0.331 + 0.365)   =  0.304 \nn\n \nThus, the depreciation of the kip has resulted in its share in the money stock falling \nfrom 50 percent to about 30 percent.  While the kip used to have the highest share in \nthe money stock, the valuation effect from the depreciation has reduced it to having \nthe smallest share.  Due to the massive depreciation of the kip against the dollar, US \ndollars now have the highest share in the money stock, when it used to have the \nsmallest share. To the extent that the depreciation was caused by the uncertainty \nintroduced by the enforcement measure, the outcome has been counter-productive.   \n \nTo return the share of the kip in the money stock to 50 percent, the usage of the kip \nwould have to increase by about 65 percent.14 It is unlikely that the enforcement \nmeasure would have resulted in a 65 percent increase in the usage of the kip.  It \nshould be noted, however, that this is purely an illustrative example.  Whilst the \nmagnitudes of the changes in the relative shares of the currency may not be precise, \nthe overall direction of change would be accurate.  The magnitudes of the changes in \nthe relative shares of the currencies would also be affected by currency substitution \neffects.  For instance, discussions with Lao officials indicate that there has been a \nsubstitution away from both baht and kip and towards the dollar after the depreciation \nof both currencies following the Asian crisis.  Although the baht continued to be used \nin cross-border trade along the Mekong, there had been some shift away from baht \nand towards dollars following large fluctuations in the relative value of the baht in the \naftermath of 1997 crisis.  These currency substitution effects are likely to affect the \nrelative shares of baht and dollars in the money stock; they are unlikely to affect the \nshare of kip in the money stock to any significant extent. \n \nImposing or forcing the use of the kip is not the answer.  Perhaps the best way of \nreducing the use of foreign currencies in Lao PDR is to reduce the distinctions \nbetween the kip and these currencies.  Enforcing the use of kip is likely to add to the \ndistinctions, or perceived differences, rather than reducing them.  If citizens are given \n                                                            \n14 That is, {(0.5 - 0.303) / 0.303} x 100 = 65 percent. ", "  \n \nthe free choice to use kip, baht or dollars in any and all transactions, then the \nperceived differences between the two are likely to slowly diminish over time.   \n \nReducing  the  distinction  between  the  currencies  will  involve,  as  a  fundamental \nrequirement, the assurance that kip can be converted into dollars freely and in any \nquantity.  With the current situation, where confidence in the kip is low, this policy \nwould effectively limit the government to issuing kip on an almost one-to-one basis \nwith foreign reserves. It could be argued that the present stock of kip, estimated at \nabout 50 percent of the money supply, currently reflects this aspect of convertibility \nalready.  Thus, the transition from an economy characterised by the MCP to a kip-\nbased economy will depend on the willingness of Lao PDR\u2019s citizens to hold the kip.  \nThis  willingness  will  require  an  assurance  of  free  convertibility  initially,  and \nconfidence in the value of the kip eventually.  In the interim, however, measures that \nimpose the use of kip should be removed in an attempt to reduce the distinctions, \nwhether perceived or real, between the currencies. We cannot escape the conclusion \nhowever that the root causes of the MCP will need to be addressed directly, and that \nthere is no other long-term solution to dealing with its implications. \n \n6. Summary \nThe multiple currency phenomenon (MCP) in Lao PDR takes the form of the use of \nforeign currencies such as dollars and baht in the presence of a domestically issued \ncurrency. The MCP appears to have more costs than benefits.  These costs include \nthe social loss associated with seigniorage, the inability to conduct an independent \nmonetary  policy  and  the  relative  ineffectiveness  of  the  exchange  rate  as  an \nadjustment mechanism. The benefits of the MCP include the discipline imposed on \nthe government by significantly limiting its capacity to finance spending through \ninflation tax, and the stability and certainty induced by an effectively fixed exchange \nrate. Having a stock of dollars or baht in circulation is sometimes viewed as a \nsignificant benefit of the MCP. At best, it can act as a cushion that alleviates the \nshort-term effects of a crisis; but that is all. \n \nIn  June  1997,  the  Bank  of  Lao  PDR  moved  to  enforce  Decree  No.  53,  which \nstipulates that only the kip could be used as a medium of exchange in all domestic \ntransactions.  This move would reflect the Government\u2019s view that the costs of the \nMCP exceed the benefits. Is enforcement the solution to overcoming the MCP? Any \nenforced measure is likely to be counter-productive, as it will increase the perceived \n                                                                                                                                                                          \n ", "  \n \ndifferences between the currencies, rather than reduce them.  Enforcement does not \naddress the underlying problem of a lack of confidence in the kip.  Although it might \nbe possible to increase the use of the kip in domestic transactions through increased \npolicing, any such increase could be reversed by depreciation of the kip.  Since the \nenforcement measures have been in place, the kip has depreciated to such an extent \nthat its share in the money stock has fallen.  Indeed, the share of the kip in the \nmoney stock following the enforcement measures resulted in it being lower than it \nhas ever been, and lower than the shares of dollars or baht in the money stock. \n \nThe long-term solution to the MCP does not lie with imposing the use of the kip.  This \nis because the MCP is not the problem, but is merely a symptom.  The problem (or \nthe cause) is a lack of confidence in the kip, whilst the symptom (or the effect) is the \nuse of another currency such as the dollar or baht.  The causes of the problem \nemanate from an underdeveloped monetary system, macroeconomic instability, and \nweak  legal  and  institutional  systems.  These  are  the  problems  that  need  to  be \naddressed directly.  When these problems are addressed, then the symptom, which \nis the MCP, will also cease to be a constraint.
