INTRODUCTION\nDespite having made significant progress in reducing poverty over the last several decades,\n690 million people, constituting more than a fifth of Asia\u2019s population, live below the $1-a-day\npoverty line (ADB 2004). On the basis of poverty lines more typically found in low-to-middle income\ncountries as opposed to only low income countries\u2014the $2-a-day poverty line\u2014an even more\nstaggering number are poor in Asia:  60% of Asia\u2019s population or 1.9 billion people. Faced with\nsuch numbers, it is difficult to argue with the notion that the reduction of poverty is the central\ndevelopment challenge facing Asia, and indeed, the developing world at large.\nWhat can policymakers do to reduce poverty? Many economists would argue that igniting\neconomic growth and sustaining it is the surest and most sustainable way to fight poverty.  Figure\n1, which plots cross-country data on economic growth and poverty reduction, is consistent with\nthis argument.1 This figure shows, for example, that a 1% increase in growth has been associated\non average with a 1.5% reduction in poverty. Moreover, episodes where poverty grew despite economic\ngrowth (quadrant 1) or where poverty declined despite economic contraction (quadrant 3) are\nclearly the minority. But Figure 1 also reveals that there is a great deal of variation in how much\neconomic growth has reduced poverty across countries and even within countries over different\nperiods of time. In statistical terms, the variation in economic growth can explain only around\n45% of the variation in poverty reduction (ADB 2004).\nFIGURE 1\nGROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION\n60\n40\npoverty (%) 20\nwth rate of  0\nnnual gro -20\nA\n-40\n-60\n-20 -15 -10 -5 0 5 10 15 20\nAnnual growth rate of mean income (%)\n1  Poverty reduction is based on changes in $1-a-day poverty rates.

First, what are the policies and institutions that can ignite and thereafter\nsustain growth. Second, how does one ensure that growth generates significant opportunities for\nthe poor.  In this paper, we discuss the evidence on both of these questions, paying special attention\nto policies and institutions that relate to the development of the private sector.  In doing so, we\nare informed not only by existing cross-country studies examining the impact of policies and\ninstitutions on economic growth and poverty, we also carry out empirical analysis of our own using\nnewly available data on poverty (World Bank-PovcalNet and ADB 2004) and indicators relating\nto the regulations under which the private sector operates (World Bank 2004).\nOur focus on private sector development stems from the now widespread belief that market\nforces and private initiative provide a powerful basis for generating economic growth and\ndevelopment. This belief explains the importance private sector development is receiving in the\nstrategies being adopted by both developing country policymakers as well as international\ndevelopment agencies. From the perspective of developing country policy making, for example,\nscores of countries have moved over the last 10 to 20 years to liberalize their trade and industrial\npolicy regimes. These liberalizations have been underpinned by the belief that greater reliance\non private agents\u2014including not only large-scale manufacturing firms but also farmers and micro-\nentrepreneurs\u2014to allocate resources on the basis of market signals would improve economic\nperformance.  Similarly, development agencies, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and\nthe World Bank, have made support to private sector development a key component of their overall\nstrategy for assisting less developed countries. ADB\u2019s private sector development strategy (ADB\n2000), notes right at the outset that the \u201cdevelopment of a strong and dynamic private sector\nis crucial to long-term, rapid economic growth.\u201d  Long term, rapid economic growth is in turn seen\nas a \u201cnecessary condition for sustained poverty reduction.\u201d\nThe policies and institutions we focus on can be distinguished into four types.  A first type\nrelates to the various regulatory barriers faced by actual and potential private sector firms.  These\nfactors are measured in terms of variables available from the Doing Business database of the World\nBank (World Bank 2004a). Examples include information on the ease of starting and closing\nbusinesses. A second type consists of broader outcome-based measures of overall policy orientations\nof the government that may affect the way businesses operate. These are captured by measures\nof openness to trade and the size of the public sector. While the former relates directly to how\nmuch domestic firms are exposed to foreign competition (via imports) and foreign markets (via\nexports), the latter captures quantitatively how important the private sector is in overall production.\nA third type relates to the institutions of governance. As is now increasingly appreciated, the most\nencouraging regulations (on paper) may not amount to much in terms of creating an enabling\nenvironment for the private sector if those regulations were enforced capriciously or by a predatory\nstate machinery. Thus it is important to take into account the policy and institutional environment\nrelated to governance.  A final set of variables relate to political institutions, in particular to political\nrights and civil liberties.\nThe results of our empirical work can be summarized as follows. We find that good governance\nas measured by a strong commitment to the rule of law, a competent and efficient government\nsector, and control of corruption matters for poverty reduction largely through its effect on economic\ngrowth. Though not a panacea, less cumbersome regulations governing private sector operations,\nespecially those pertaining to starting a business, matter for both economic growth as well as poverty\n2 JULY 2006", "SECTION II\nINSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES AND WHY THEY MATTER\nFOR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE\nreduction more directly. While the impact of trade openness on growth is not clear, increases in\ntrade shares have been associated with lower poverty. Furthermore, the size of the public sector\nhas a strong negative effect on growth and can be bad for poverty alleviation. Finally, political\nfreedom is not associated with either higher growth or lower poverty.  Taken together, the evidence\nhere seems to suggest that the delivery of good governance and regulations that facilitate the\ncreation of new enterprises are more relevant for growth and poverty reduction than the nature\nof the political system through which such governance and regulations are delivered.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II provides a brief discussion on policies and\ninstitutions for private sector development and why these should matter for economic performance\nand thus economic development. Section III reviews the related literature. Section IV describes\nthe methodology and Section V the data and their sources. Section VI provides an in-depth\ndescription and discussion of results. Section VII concludes.\nII. INSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES AND WHY THEY MATTER\nFOR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE\nThe dividing line between institutions and policies is thin. Nevertheless, it is useful to try\nand distinguish between them for purposes of understanding their roles in improving economic\nperformance.  One basis for distinguishing between the two is that institutions encompass the formal\nand informal rules and customs within which individuals and firms operate; policies, on the other\nhand, refer to various strategies and measures a government adopts to achieve its goals and\nobjectives within a country\u2019s institutional framework (Quibria 2002).  Of course, policies can have\na profound impact on a country\u2019s institutions, and this is ultimately what the objective of the efforts\nat policy reform in developing countries is about.  In what follows, we discuss in more detail what\ninstitutions are, what they encompass, and why they are important to economic functioning and\nperformance.  We also briefly cover key policies that may have an important bearing on economic\nperformance and on the process of institutional change itself.\nA. Institutions\nThe work of Douglas North has been an important influence on economists\u2019 thinking about\ninstitutions and their linkages with economic performance. North (1990) describes institutions\nas the \u201crules of the game\u201d in a society. In his words, institutions encompass \u201chumanly devised\nconstraints that shape human interaction.\u201d These constraints can be formal or informal. The former\nwould include constitutions, laws, and regulations governing politics and economics, while the\nlatter would include conventions, customs, codes of behavior, and conduct. Formal rules and informal\nconstraints together determine the incentives in human exchange: political, social, and economic.\nImportantly, how well the given institutions function depends on the nature of enforcement, that\nis, how costly it is to identify violations of the \u201crules of the game\u201d and how severe the punishments\nfor deviating from rules are.\nWhy are institutions important to economic performance?  According to North, institutions\nhave a profound influence on the incentive structure of a society. Countries are rich or poor\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 82 3", "INSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES FOR GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION:\nTHE ROLE OF PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT\nRANA HASAN, DEVASHISH MITRA, AND MEHMET ULUBASOGLU\ndepending on whether their institutional constraints define a set of payoffs to political and economic\nactivity that encourage productive activity. Put differently, when organizations, including firms,\ntrade unions, political parties, business associations, etc. are engaged in what are unproductive\nactivities it is because the institutional framework in which they operate provides them with an\nincentive to be unproductive. In developing countries the institutional framework \u201coverwhelmingly\nfavor activities that promote redistributive rather than productive activity, that create monopolies\nrather than competitive conditions, and that restrict opportunities rather than expand them. They\nseldom induce investment in education that increases productivity\u201d (North 1990, 9). In this way\ninstitutions affect both the process of capital accumulation as well as the process of converting\nthis capital into output.\nIf developing countries are poor because their current institutions provide a weak basis for\nproviding the incentives that generate growth, what type of institutions should they acquire?  And\nhow can developing countries get there? Recent research has been in far more agreement on the\nfirst of these questions than the second.\nConsider the first question.  By and large, most economists today would assign a critical role\nto private incentives and initiatives in driving modern economic growth via the accumulation of\ncapital and the conversion of that capital and labor into marketable output.  Underlying this process\nof private accumulation, production, and exchange, however, has been a set of market-supporting\ninstitutions. The most fundamental among these have been the existence of secure and stable\nproperty rights and the rule of law. The importance of these was clearly noted and anticipated\nby Adam Smith in his Wealth of Nations (as cited in Rodrik, Subramanian, and Trebbi 2002, 1):\n\u201cCommerce and manufactures can seldom flourish long in any state which does not enjoy a regular\nadministration of justice, in which the people do not feel themselves secure in the possession of\ntheir property, in which the faith of contracts is not supported by law, and in which the authority\nof the state is not supposed to be regularly employed in enforcing the payment of debts from\nall those who are able to pay. Commerce and manufactures, in short, can seldom flourish in any\nstate in which there is not a certain degree of confidence in the justice of government.\u201d\nThe experience of today\u2019s prosperous countries therefore suggests that stable property rights\nand the rule of law are prerequisites for a dynamic private sector to emerge. However, their experience\nalso reveals that market economies require much more if they are to function efficiently and with\nat least a modicum of equity. As the experience of the 20th century has shown, market economies\nalso need fiscal and monetary institutions that perform stabilizing functions, institutions that try\nto check market failures and regulate conduct in all sorts of markets including those dealing with\ngoods and services, labor, and finance; and institutions that provide social insurance (Rodrik 1999).\nIt is difficult to imagine that today\u2019s developing countries, which are by and large transitioning\nto more fully market-based economic systems, will attain prosperity without these market-supporting\ninstitutions.  The acquisition of these institutions is therefore part of their developmental challenge.\nHowever, it is far from clear how poor countries should go about acquiring these institutions (and\nas noted below, even how urgently they need all of them).\nRodrik (1999) discusses and contrasts two alternative approaches to the acquisition of\ninstitutions. According to the first, it is possible to \u201cimport [the] blueprint\u201d or institutional design\nfrom the developed world.  Following this approach the removal of price distortions and privatization\nof enterprises would be accompanied by a set of \u201cgovernance\u201d reforms that would include the\n4 JULY 2006", "SECTION II\nINSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES AND WHY THEY MATTER\nFOR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE\nenactment of legal codes and legislations (often in line with those existing in the developed\ncountries), establishment of an independent judiciary, etc.\nThe second approach, however, emphasizes that local circumstances will require in many cases\na unique, context-specific institutional design. The usefulness and importance of such an approach\ncan be understood and appreciated through the very real caution suggested by North (1994, 8):\n\u201ceconomies that adopt the formal rules of another economy will have very different performance\ncharacteristics than the first economy because of different informal norms and enforcement.  The\nimplication is that transferring the formal political and economic rules of successful western\neconomies to Third World and Eastern European economies is not a sufficient condition for good\neconomic performance.\u201d\nConsider the case of property rights and rule of law (investor perceptions of which are shown\nto be strongly associated with better economic performance as both our literature survey below\nas well as our own empirical work reveals). While strengthening property rights and rule of law\nin an economy where they have been weak or absent to begin with are very likely to be instrumental\nin getting entrepreneurs and investors to expand their investment activities, there is more than\none way to establish stronger property rights and respect for the rule of law.  An illustration from\nRodrik (2004), contrasting Russia in the 1990s with People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s (PRC) investment\nboom driven by the township and village enterprises in the 1980s (TVEs) reveals quite clearly the\ncomplexities involved in successful institutional change.  In the 1990s Russia provided its citizens\nwith a private property rights regime that was ostensibly enforced by an independent judiciary.\nHowever, surveys routinely revealed that investors consistently gave low marks to the country insofar\nas rule of law was concerned. Why? While Russia made the appropriate legislative changes, weaknesses\nin enforcement and the actual codes of conduct to which Russians were accustomed to probably\ndiluted the effectiveness of these changes.\nPut differently, context matters so that \u201cinstitutional outcomes do not map into unique\ninstitutional design.\u201d Consider now the case of the PRC. The investment booms in the PRC\u2019s TVEs\ntook place despite the nonexistence of a private property regime and an independent judiciary.\nApparently, investors did believe their \u201cproperty\u201d to be safe. Drawing upon the work of Qian (2002),\nRodrik (2004, 9) points to what may have served to provide secure property rights when none\nactually existed formally: with local governments typically the owners of the TVEs and private\nentrepreneurs as \u201ceffective\u201d partners, \u201cprivate entrepreneurs felt secure not because the government\nwas prevented from expropriating them, but because, sharing in the profits, it had no interest\nto expropriate them.\u201d\nFollowing the second approach\u2019s emphasis on local context, the general lesson is that \u201cthere\nis no unique, noncontext specific way of achieving desirable institutional outcomes.\u201d  This, of course,\nmakes it more difficult to give policy advice.  But Rodrik argues that while good institutions are\nultimately crucial for sustaining growth, igniting growth need not wait until large-scale institutional\ntransformation has been generated. Instead, igniting growth entails the easier task of being able\nto identify and relax specific constraints that are holding back the private sector. Thus, in the case\nof the PRC in the late 1970s and 1980s, the main \u201cbinding\u201d constraint to growth may have been\nthe absence of market-oriented incentives. Doing away with the household responsibility system\nand allowing local governments to \u201cown\u201d the TVEs were innovations that gave entrepreneurs\nincentives to be productive within the existing overall institutional framework. More generally,\nthe challenge for policy then becomes the search for responses that are appropriate for local\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 82 5", "INSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES FOR GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION:\nTHE ROLE OF PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT\nRANA HASAN, DEVASHISH MITRA, AND MEHMET ULUBASOGLU\nconditions.  This in turn requires an encouragement of experimentation\u2014risks notwithstanding\u2014\nwith reforms of different elements of the current institutional framework to see what types of reforms\nwork and which ones do not.\nB. Policies\nPolicies can be thought of as the instruments by which governments can change the \u201crules\nof the game.\u201d Which policies have a particularly important bearing on economic performance?  More\nto the point, what policies are holding back the private sector? Until very recently policy advice\nfor generating growth and spurring the private sector tended to emphasize policy reforms focused\non a relatively narrow range of areas. In particular, policy reforms have been targeted toward\nmacroeconomic stabilization, price liberalizations, trade liberalizations, and the privatization of\npublic sector enterprises.\nUnfortunately, undertaking these policy reforms has not led to a big expansion in private\nsector activities; conversely, the private sectors of some countries that have avoided the above\nset of policy reforms have boomed (World Bank 2003). This has led analysts to look more closely\nat the full range of policies that influence the environment in which production takes place (as\nwell as the institutional framework in which policies operate).\nRodrik (2003) contrasts two views on the policies and processes that can get \u201centrepreneurs\nexcited about investing in the home economy.\u201d One view emphasizes cumbersome and misguided\ngovernment regulations as the constraint to entrepreneurship and a vibrant private sector. The\nsecond view emphasizes market imperfections in developing countries. Accordingly, the government\nshould not just get out of the way of the private sector. Instead it needs to find ways to crowd-\nin private investment.\nAccording to the first view, government imposed imperfections, which include: \u201cmacroeconomic\ninstability and high inflation, high government wages that distort the functioning of labor markets,\na large tax burden, arbitrary regulations, burdensome licensing requirements, corruption\u201d among\nothers are holding back the private sector. Surveys of enterprises, including the investment climate\nstudies (ICS) initiated by the World Bank and also being carried out by the ADB become a key\ntool in determining which aspects of government policy and regulations constrain the operations\nand growth of the private sector.\nPer the second view, however, \u201ceconomies can get stuck in the low-level equilibrium due to\nthe nature of technology and markets, even when government policy does not penalize\nentrepreneurship.\u201d Rodrik points out that even though developing countries need not create new\ntechnologies they do need to adapt technologies that are new to them.  This process of adaptation\nwill usually require a certain amount of human capital internal to the individual and the firm\ncontemplating use of the new technology. But crucially both the costs of adaptation as well as\nthe returns from adaptation are often subject to externalities. For example, the costs of producing\na new (for the developing countries) good may be uncertain. The uncertainties can deter investors.\nHowever, even one investor\u2019s entry into the new line of production would provide information\non the costs. If the investor struggles, then this is a signal that the costs of production are high.\nIf the investor, on the other hand, is successful then this is a signal that the costs of production\nare worth the effort. The point is that \u201centrepreneurs engaged in the cost discovery process incur\n6 JULY 2006", "SECTION III\nSURVEY OF RELATED LITERATURE\nprivate costs, but provide social benefits that can vastly exceed the anticipated profits.\u201d The end\neffect is that \u201cthe relevant learning is under produced in a decentralized equilibrium, with the\nconsequences being that the economy fails to diversify into non-traditional, more advanced lines\nof activity. In such a scenario there will be policy interventions which would improve upon the\ndecentralized outcome\u201d (Rodrik 2003, 21).\nBoth of these views have merit. This is because both factors may be at work, even within the\nsame country. Thus while learning externalities may be holding back certain types of investments,\nother investments could be constrained by unnecessarily burdensome regulation. Consider the\nwide range of regulatory policies that govern the rules and regulations on starting and closing\na business. Cumbersome and/or costly regulations for starting a business could easily result in\nlower entry than otherwise; they could also lead to a lack of competition faced by existing firms.\nThe result would not only be lower investment than otherwise, but also lower efficiency among\nincumbents protected from competition. Similarly, regulatory hurdles in closing a business would\nprevent firms that are currently inefficient from exiting the market. They may also deter entry by\nartificially raising the cost of exiting if market conditions ultimately prove to be too difficult for\na firm.\nA similar logic applies to labor market regulations.  Labor market regulations encompass a\nnumber of issues, including the rules governing industrial relations and collective bargaining,\nhiring and firing of workers, minimum wage laws, health and safety regulations, and mandated\nbenefits.  These regulations can have significant implications for both efficiency as well as equity.\nFor example, while restrictions on firing would protect the welfare of the employed, they may end\nup harming employment generation in general as firms respond to firing restrictions by reducing\nthe number of workers they would otherwise hire.  In an extreme case, strong restrictions to firing\ncould even end up constraining investments, especially in labor-intensive activities as has often\nbeen claimed in the case of India (see, for example, Besley and Burgess 2003).\nIII. SURVEY OF RELATED LITERATURE\nA. Institutions, Policies, and Growth\nAs may be alluded from the previous discussion, the work by North (1990) has generated\na great deal of interest in the role of institutions in determining output and growth. Knack and\nKeefer (1995) looked at the impact of property rights on economic growth. In particular, they\nstudy the effects of contract enforceability and risk. While the variables are shown to have an impact\non growth, controlling for them generates estimates that show faster conditional convergence to\nincomes levels in the United States. In a subsequent paper, Keefer and Knack (1997) look at how\nthe convergence rate itself might be a function of indicators of institutional quality such as the\nrule of law, corruption, and the risk of expropriation and contract repudiation. They study this\nby interacting initial income with these institutional indicators on the right-hand side of a standard,\ncross-country growth regression.2\n2 Another paper that pursues this line of research is Rodrik (1997), which looks at the role of institutions in explaining\nthe stellar growth performance of East Asian economies prior to the Asian financial crisis. Almost all the variation\nin their growth performance is explained by initial income, initial education, and institutional quality. His measure\nof institutional quality is drawn from the work of Knack and Keefer (1995) and Easterly and Levine (1996).\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 82 7", "INSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES FOR GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION:\nTHE ROLE OF PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT\nRANA HASAN, DEVASHISH MITRA, AND MEHMET ULUBASOGLU\nMauro (1995) focuses on the effect of corruption on growth and finds it to be negative in\nhis cross-country regressions. He also looks at the effects of a subjective perceptions-based index\nof bureaucratic efficiency as well as that of political stability and finds them to be positive. Due\nto the possibility of reverse causation from growth to institutions, there is a potential endogeneity\nproblem, which Mauro corrects by instrumenting corruption by an index of ethnolinguistic\nfractionalization.\nAnother important study is by Barro (1997) who studies a panel of around 100 countries\nfrom 1960 to 1990. Using controls such as the initial level of real per capita gross domestic product\n(GDP), initial schooling, life expectancy, fertility, government consumption, inflation, and terms\nof trade, growth is found to be increasing in the rule of law. Although Barro finds a weak effect\nof political freedom on growth, there is some indication of a nonlinear relation, an inverted U-\nshaped relationship between democracy and growth, with the growth-maximizing level of political\nfreedom lying somewhere in between a pure democracy and pure dictatorship.\nUsing a new database consisting of 300 indicators of governance and creating six aggregates\nout of those, namely rule of law, corruption, political instability, voice and accountability, and\ngovernment efficiency and regulatory burden, Kaufmann, Kraay, and Zoido-Lobaton (1999) show\nthat there is a strong association between good governance and growth, with the causation running\nfrom the former to the latter. The instruments they use for their governance indicators are the\nones used by Hall and Jones (1999).\nWhile the above papers emphasize the effect of institutions on growth, later work has mainly\nemphasized the impact of institutions on income levels and not on growth rates. In support of\nthis change in emphasis, Hall and Jones (1999) have argued that \u201clevels capture the differences\nin long-run economic performance that are most directly relevant to welfare as measured by the\nconsumption of goods and services.\u201d Also, in this context they point to the recent evidence on\nthe transitional nature of growth rate differences across countries; the empirical questioning by\nJones (1995) of the relevance of endogenous growth models; and the theoretical support from\nrecent models that show the effect of policies on income levels and not on growth rates, and where\ncountries in the long run differ in their income levels and not growth rates.\nHall and Jones (1999) look at how capital accumulation, productivity, and therefore output\nper worker are affected by social infrastructure. Social infrastructure here refers to institutional\nand policy variables that determine the economic environment determining capital accumulation,\nskill formation, invention, innovation and technology transfer. Their measure of social infrastructure\nis based on measures of corruption, expropriation risk, government repudiation of contracts, law\nand order, bureaucratic quality, and trade barriers. While output is made a function of social\ninfrastructure in their estimation framework, they correct for endogeneity of the latter using\ninstruments such as geographical variables, mainly distance from the equator and the extent to\nwhich modern European languages are spoken as first languages today, which captures European\ninfluences on institutions. Their study concludes that countries with better social infrastructure\nhave higher levels of output per worker in the long run, have higher investment rates, and are\nmore efficient at converting inputs to output.\nRecently, a major advance in this literature has been made by Acemoglu, Johnson, and\nRobinson (2001) who looked at former European colonies to study the impact of institutions on\nper capita income levels. For these countries, they are able to use European settler mortality rates\nas instruments for institutions. In countries conquered by Europeans, whether they decided to\n8 JULY 2006", "SECTION III\nSURVEY OF RELATED LITERATURE\npermanently settle or not was determined by their ability to survive there (by their mortality rates).\nIf they decided to settle in a country themselves, they adopted good institutions, while if they\ndecided to rule from their home country, they put in place extractive institutions. Their decision\nto settle in a region, however, was a function of their mortality there. On the other hand, mortality\nrates of potential settlers, to begin with, can be viewed as a function of geographical variables.\nWhile even after instrumenting for institutions (expropriation risk that current and potential investors\nface), Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson find statistically significant effects of these variables\non per capita income in the expected direction, the instrumentation completely takes away the\neffect of geographical variables on income.\nTurning to trade policy, the effects of trade barriers on growth and income have been studied\nsince the early 1990s. While Dollar (1992), Sachs and Warner (1995), and Edwards (1998) showed\npositive effects of trade on growth using different measures of openness, in many cases constructed\nfrom standard policy measures, these papers have been strongly criticized by Rodriguez and Rodrik\n(2001) for the problems with measures of trade openness and the econometric techniques used,\nas well as for the difficulty in establishing the direction of causality. While Rodriguez and Rodrik\n(2001) have criticized the measure of openness used by Sachs and Warner (1995) as capturing\nmany aspects of the macroeconomic environment in addition to trade policy, Baldwin (2002) has\nrecently defended that approach on the grounds that the other policy reforms captured in the\nmeasure, though not trade reforms per se, accompany most trade reforms sponsored by international\ninstitutions. Therefore, using such a measure tells us the value of the entire package of trade and\naccompanying reforms. Wacziarg and Welch (2003) have updated the Sachs-Warner data set and\nhave again shown the benefit of such reforms in driving growth.\nJust as in the case of the literature on the effect of institutions as explained above, the trade\nliterature has also shifted focus to levels from growth rates. Frankel and Romer (1999) look at\nthe effect of trade share in GDP on income levels across countries for the year 1985. They construct\nan instrument for the trade share by summing up the gravity-model driven, geography-based\npredicted values of bilateral trade flows across all trading partners. The variables used to predict\nbilateral trade flows include distance, country size variables such as land area and population,\nand dummies for whether the countries are landlocked or have a common border, etc. They find\nthat their instrumental variables approach produces positive effects of trade on income levels that\nare greater than the estimates produced by ordinary least squares. Irwin and Tervio (2002) apply\nthe Frankel-Romer approach to cross-country data from various periods in the 20th century to show\nthat this trade\u2013income relationship is indeed highly robust.\nBuilding on two literatures, namely the one on institutions and incomes and the other on\ntrade and incomes, Rodrik, Subramanian, and Trebbi (2002) looked at the simultaneous effects\nof institutions, geography, and trade on per capita income levels.  They used a measure of property\nrights and the rule of law to capture institutions and the trade\u2013GDP ratio to capture openness\nin trade, treating both as endogenous in their growth regressions. They used the instruments of\nAcemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001) and Frankel and Romer (1999) to instrument institutions\nand trade openness, respectively, and separately.  Rodrik, Subramanian and Trebbi (2002) find\nthat \u201cthe quality of institutions trumps everything else.\u201d However, trade and institutions have positive\neffects on each other, so that the former affects incomes through the latter. Similarly, geography\nalso affects institutions.\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 82 9", "INSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES FOR GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION:\nTHE ROLE OF PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT\nRANA HASAN, DEVASHISH MITRA, AND MEHMET ULUBASOGLU\nB. Institutions, Policies, and Poverty\nMoving from growth rates and incomes to poverty, we find that the literature on the\ndeterminants of poverty rates and changes (or reductions) in it is much smaller. Dollar and Kraay\n(2002), in a cross-country study of 92 countries over the last four decades, find that the growth\nrates of average incomes of people in the bottom quintile are no different from the growth rates\nof overall per capita incomes, with the former growth always positively associated with the latter.\nThus the share of the bottom quintile of the population in overall income is fairly stable. Likewise,\npolicies that promote overall growth advance growth in the incomes of the poor.  These policies\ninclude trade openness, macroeconomic stability, moderate government size, financial development,\nand strong property rights and the rule of law.\nOne difficulty with interpreting the results of Dollar and Kraay is in their measure of poverty\nbeing a relative one.  Due to their focus on incomes of the bottom quintile, it can be argued that\ntheir paper is more directly connected to the issue of inequality rather than absolute poverty per\nse. As a number of analysts have argued, insofar as developing countries are concerned, it is not\nso much relative poverty but absolute poverty that needs to be the focus of attention. Cross-country\nstudies on absolute poverty are to our knowledge very limited. Ravallion (2001) studies the\nrelationship between $1-a-day poverty rates and economic growth. He finds that an increase in\nper capita income by 1% can reduce the proportion of people below the $1-a-day poverty line\nby about 2.5% on average. This \u201cpoverty elasticity\u201d varies across countries, depending on initial\ninequality. In other words, how close the poor are to the poverty line matters. Ravallion, however,\ndoes not examine the links between (absolute) poverty and policies. A recent paper that does so\nis that of Hasan, Quibria, and Kim (2003). A key finding of this paper is that measures of economic\nfreedom are found to be closely linked to reductions in poverty.3 A measure of political freedom,\non the other hand, is not. Economic freedom indicators used by these authors include government\nsize, price stability, freedom to trade with foreigners, and measures of political and civil liberties.\nMoving to country-specific empirical work, a notable study is that of Ravallion and Datt (1999)\non the determinants of poverty reduction across India\u2019s major states between 1960 and 1994.\nThe study shows empirically how initial conditions\u2014and thus initial inequalities\u2014matter. Similar\nto the findings from cross-country comparisons of poverty\u2013growth linkages, Ravallion and Datt\nfind that the impact of a given amount of growth in nonfarm output on poverty reduction can\nvary considerably across India\u2019s states.  For example, a 1% increase in nonagricultural state domestic\nproduct leads to a 1.2% decline in poverty rates in the states of Kerala and West Bengal versus\nonly 0.3% decline in Bihar. The fact that growth of nonfarm output was also relatively meager\nin Bihar over the period under consideration exacerbated the poverty problem in Bihar.4\n3 It may be noted that this paper derives estimates of absolute poverty by combining data on the distribution of per\ncapita income (expenditure) with national account data on income (private consumption expenditure). Such an approach\nhas been used by Bhalla (2002) and Sala-I-Martin (2002).\n4 Ravallion and Datt then explore which factors \u201cexplain\u201d this differential impact of nonfarm sector growth on poverty\nby state. Differences in initial conditions relating to rural development and human resources are found to be a key\nsource of the interstate differential in poverty impacts of nonfarm output. The role played by initial literacy appears\nespecially large. In particular, Ravallion and Datt find that more than half of the differential impact of nonfarm output\non poverty rates is attributable to Kerala\u2019s much higher levels of initial literacy. Their results suggest that while the\n10 JULY 2006", "SECTION IV\nMETHODOLOGY\nIV. METHODOLOGY\nIn this paper, we look at the determinants of growth and poverty focusing attention on\ninstitutions and policies, especially those relating to regulation of the private sector. Our variables\non the right-hand side fall into two broad categories, namely institutional indicators and policy\nvariables. Thus, our estimating equation for growth is the following:\ng = \u03b1 + \u03b1 y + \u03b1 INV + \u03b2  Inst  + \u03b3  Policy + \u03b5 (1)\ni 0 1(cid:127)  i 2(cid:127)  i (cid:127) i  (cid:127) i  i\nwhere g stands for the average growth rate of per capita income during a decade (1990\u20131999),\ni\ny stands for the logarithm of initial per capita income (at the beginning of the decade), INV stands\ni  i \nfor the average investment rate (investment as a fraction of overall GDP) for that decade, Inst\ni\nis the decade average vector of institutional variables and Policy the vector of policy variables.5\ni \nOur estimating equation for poverty is the following:\nP = b  + b y + B   Inst + C   Policy + v (2)\ni 0 1  i (cid:127) i  (cid:127) i  i\nwhere P stands for the poverty rate, given by the under-$2-a-day headcount ratio in 1999 and\ni\nthe other variables are as defined earlier.\nThe institutional variables include a measure of governance\u2014the principle-component\naggregate of measures of the rule of law, government efficiency, and corruption.  These also include\nthe \u201cmeta-institution\u201d of democracy as captured by an index of political freedom.  Why do we include\na measure of political freedom? There is a strong presumption that the lack of property rights,\nhigh regulatory burden, and high levels of corruption, etc., result in high levels of rent-seeking\nactivity and the exploitation of the rest of the society by the elite through the exercise of \u201cpublic\npower for private benefit\u201d. Thus the poor could end up getting a very small share of an already\nsmall pie. In a democracy, however, it can be dangerous to keep a significant proportion of the\npopulation deprived and angry. Alternatively, political freedom could lead to populist policies that\ncould end up reducing economic growth. We therefore look at the impact of political freedom and\ngovernance on the incidence of poverty.\nSome have argued that institutions are endogenous to growth. However, in the new literature\n(Hall and Jones 1999; Rodrik, Subramanian, and Trebbi 2004) as explained in Section III, it is\ntransition from (low-wage) agriculture to (higher wage) nonfarm sectors may be key for the removal of poverty, making\nthe transition is not easy or automatic for the poor. In other words, there are costs to be incurred on the part of\na poor agricultural worker to making the transition. These costs are not only pecuniary ones but also nonpecuniary\nassociated with investments in minimum levels of education, nutrition, and health so as to be able to work productively\nin the nonfarm sector.\n5 The institutional and policy variables can affect the rate of growth through investment and other channels. Therefore,\nwe run the above regression with and without INV as a regressor. This helps us somewhat in identifying the investment\nand noninvestment channels.\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 82 11", "INSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES FOR GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION:\nTHE ROLE OF PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT\nRANA HASAN, DEVASHISH MITRA, AND MEHMET ULUBASOGLU\nthe income level and not the growth rate that depends on institutions, which in turn also depend\non the income level itself. If we believe that institutions are slow to adjust, then using initial per\ncapita income as a control should take care of the bulk of the endogeneity problem.\nThe policy variables capture key regulations governing the operations of the private sector.\nThese include measures relating to the ease of starting a business, closing a business, and labor\nmarket policies that businesses must abide by. Our policy variables also include measures of\ngovernment size and trade openness. We know that the public sector provides basic infrastructure\nand social services, and that, at one level, it can have strong complementarities with the private\nsector. However, too big a government can lead to inefficiency especially if it tries to operate in\nspheres that are normally meant for the private sector. Also, big governments can be captured\nby the elite and can promote rent seeking at the cost of real production. Trade, on the other hand,\ncan generate efficiency through gains from specialization and exchange, as well as through the\navailability of larger varieties of final and intermediate goods. Thus, it can result in enhanced\nreal incomes. While the theoretical foundations for enhanced real income levels through trade\nare strong, the growth effects are less clear cut. There is a vast and rich theoretical literature on\ntrade and growth, but the results span the entire spectrum depending on the specifics of the\nassumptions made. Therefore, this is an empirical question that has received considerable attention\nrecently but for which no conclusive answers have been provided so far.\nFurther, the size of the public sector and trade openness should also have an impact on poverty.\nAs explained above, the size of the public sector should affect income and growth and thus, for\na given distribution of income, have an impact on poverty. Additionally, the size of the public\nsector can also have an impact on the distribution of income. If the government believes in making\nsociety more egalitarian, it will use its machinery to provide social services for the relatively poorer\nsections of the society. On the other hand, the government can just be an instrument of the elite,\nwhich means that an increase in government size will worsen the distribution of income. We therefore\nempirically explore the relationship between poverty and the share of the government in overall\nGDP.\nInternational trade can have an impact on poverty through its effects on the overall level\nof real income, the distribution of income, the sectoral composition of the economy, the relative\nrewards to different factors of production and the extent of urbanization. Again, trade affects poverty\nthrough both growth and distribution. As Bhagwati (2004, 53), focusing on the growth channel\nwrites, \u201cThe scientific analysis of the effect of trade on poverty \u2026 has centered on a two-step\nargument: that trade enhances growth, and that growth reduces poverty.\u201d Furthermore, Winters,\nMcCulloch, and McKay (2004) argue that \u201calthough growth can be unequalizing, it has to be strongly\nso if it is to increase absolute poverty. This appears to be not the case either in general or for\ngrowth associated with freer trade.\u201d They argue that it is, in fact, the openness-growth link on\nwhich economists differ.\nOther channels, according to Winters, McCulloch, and McKay through which trade can affect\npoverty are through its effects on overall economic stability, the creation and destruction of markets,\noutput prices, wages, and employment. Also, how trade will affect wages of the poor will depend\non the nature of factor endowments and comparative advantage. An important factor here is the\nextent of transitional unemployment caused by trade liberalization that gets concentrated on the\npoor. Finally, trade liberalization also does have an impact on the poor through its effects on\ngovernment revenue.\n12 JULY 2006", "SECTION V\nDATA\nV. DATA\nOur complete data set covers over a hundred countries, each with one data point (a decadal\naverage unless otherwise stated) for each variable over the period 1990\u20131999. Fifteen countries\nare from developing Asia. Our data set covers a number of variables obtained from various sources.\nGrowth is the average of annual percentage changes in real GDP per capita (base year 1995) within\na decade.  Initial income is the log real per capita income of 1990. INV is the share of investment\n(gross capital formation) in GDP; PUB is the share of general government final consumption\nexpenditure in GDP; and trade/GDP is the sum of exports and imports of goods and services measured\nas a share of gross domestic product. We obtained these data from World Development Indicators\n(World Bank 2003).\nPoverty is measured as the proportion of the population living on less than \u201c$2-a-day\u201d and\nis primarily obtained from the PovcalNet database of the World Bank (World Bank 2004b).6 For\na few countries from developing Asia, however, we replaced the poverty estimates from PovcalNet\nwith estimates from Key Indicators (ADB 2004). These countries are Cambodia, Lao PDR, Malaysia,\nNepal, Pakistan, and Viet Nam.7 While Chen and Ravallion (2004) describe the PovcalNet data in\ndetail, the following points are useful to keep in mind. First, the PovcalNet database presents two\ntypes of poverty esitmates:  \u201cactual\u201d and \u201csynthetic.\u201d The former pertain to years in which nationally\nrepresentative household income and/or expenditure surveys were carried out. The latter pertain\nto poverty estimates derived for common \u201creference\u201d years.8   We use poverty estimates from 1990\nand 1999 reference years for the 76 developing countries that overlap across our sample and the\nPovcalNet database.  While many of these reference-year estimates may be \u201csynthetic\u201d ones, including\nthese in the analysis allows us to carry out a much richer analysis than would otherwise have been\npossible. Second, our choice of using the $2-a-day poverty line, as opposed to the $1-a-day poverty\nline popularly used in the international media, is due to the fact that it conforms better with poverty\nlines more typical in low-middle-income countries as opposed to low-income countries only.\nAdditionally, using the $2-a-day poverty line enables us to increase our sample size in a meaningful\nway. This is because while $1-a-day poverty estimates exist for many middle-income countries,\nthese estimates can be extremely low (close to 0) thereby reducing the variation in poverty rates\nin the way that could bias econometric results.\nPolitical freedom is the simple average of the countries\u2019 political rights and civil liberties scores\nas given in the Freedom House (2003) report. The correlation between political rights and civil\nliberties is very high, so taking their simple average is expected to measure the overall political\nfreedom in the countries.\nWe have also utilized a set of institutional variables capturing the state of \u201cgovernance\u201d obtained\nfrom Kaufman et al. (1999). These are measures of Rule of Law, Government Efficiency, and Control\nof Corruption. While we used these variables individually in the regressions, we also exercised\n6 The term $2-a-day is used for convenience. The actual figure is $2.15 in 1993 PPP exchange rates for the consumption\naggregate.\n7 See ADB (2004) for more details.\n8 Since most countries typically carry out the relevant household surveys every 3-5 years, it will be common to find\nthat a survey is not carried out in one of the reference years. In all such cases, poverty estimates are obtained for\nreference years using the extrapolation methods of Chen and Ravallion (2004).\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 82 13", "INSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES FOR GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION:\nTHE ROLE OF PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT\nRANA HASAN, DEVASHISH MITRA, AND MEHMET ULUBASOGLU\nwith their principal components aggregation, and we report the results with this variable. Additionally,\nbecause these data are available from 1996 onward, we used the 1996 values only, and in that\nway we limited the scope for reverse causation.\nWe also used a set of Doing Business variables obtained from World Bank (2004a). While\nthere are five broad categories (entry regulations, labor regulations, contract enforcement, getting\ncredit, and closing business) to measure business regulations, with several criteria within each\ncategory, we used some single measures. These are for the categories of entry regulations, closing\nbusiness categories, and labor regulations, to capture the business environment, believing that\nthe other categories are generally covered by our other governance variables. The original sources\nfor these data are Djankov et al. (2002) and Djankov et al. (2003), respectively, for entry/starting\na business, closing a business, and labor market regulations. In particular, for entry regulations\nwe used the number of procedures for starting a business, cost of starting a business (as a percent\nof income per capita), and time/duration taken for starting a business (in days). As in the case\nof Kaufman et al. variables, we exercised with these single indicators as well as with their principal\ncomponents aggregation. Regarding closing a business, we used the cost of closing a business\n(as a percent of the value of the estate) and time required for closing a business (in years), as\nboth single and aggregated indicators. For labor market regulations, we worked with indexes of\nregulatory difficulties associated with hiring workers and firing workers (the values of both indexes\nranging from 0 to 100), and the costs of firing workers (in terms of weekly wages).9  Lastly, we\naggregated these various Doing Business indicators using principal components to obtain aggregated\nDoing Business variables, and the results are also reported with these variables. The Doing Business\nvariables\u2014whether in aggregated form or in terms of their individual values\u2014are again treated\nas belonging to the 1990s.\nVI. RESULTS\nA. Summary Statistics and Broad Regional/Country Comparisons\nTables 1 to 3 present summary statistics on the variables of interest in this paper.  While Table\n1 presents mean values by region for all but the Doing Business variables, Tables 2 and 3 present\ncountry-specific values for all variables pertinent to this paper\u2019s analysis including the Doing Business\nvariables for not only ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs) but also various other countries,\ndeveloping and developed, to serve as points of comparison.\n9 The difficulty of hiring index measures whether term contracts can only be used for temporary tasks; the maximum\nduration of term contracts; and the ratio of the mandated minimum wage to the average value added per working\npopulation.  The difficulty of firing index is composed of various components that include whether regulations allow\ndismissal on the basis of worker redundancy, whether the firing of redundant workers require notification of labor\nunion or labor ministry, whether their approval is required, etc. The cost of firing indicator measures the cost of\nadvance notice requirements, severance payments, and penalties that may arise when firing a worker.  All of these\ncosts are totaled and expressed in terms of weekly wages. See World Bank (2004a).\n14 JULY 2006", "SECTION VI\nRESULTS\nConsider first the region-specific averages presented in Table 1. The DMCs are grouped into\nthree categories:\n(i) DMC South Asia comprising Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan\n(ii) DMC East and Southeast Asia (ESA) 3 comprising Republic of Korea; Singapore; and\nTaipei,China\n(iii) DMC East and Southeast Asia (ESA) 7 comprising Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China,\nIndonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam\nThe first three columns of Table 1 reveal that as of 1990 the highest poverty rates existed\nin South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and DMC ESA 7.  As for changes in poverty, the largest declines\ntook place in DMC ESA 7.  South Asia also saw reasonable declines in poverty; however, this record\nis rendered a bit suspect due to the case of Pakistan for which national estimates of poverty reveal\npoverty to have increased slightly over the 1990s (see ADB 2004 for more details).  In contrast,\ndeclines in poverty were on average meager for sub-Saharan Africa.\nThe experiences with poverty reduction follow closely the experiences with economic growth.\nThus, the large declines in poverty experienced by ESA 7 have been accompanied by high growth\nper capita incomes-on average 4% per annum. Similarly, sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s meager reduction\nin poverty has been accompanied by a slight contraction of its economy over the 1990s.  A clear\noutlier in this general pattern is the Middle East and North Africa region.  In this region, despite\npositive though low economic growth, we find that poverty rates increased by 5 percentage points\nover the 1990s.\nHigh growth in the ESA region has itself been accompanied by a high share of investment\nin GDP, low shares of government consumption expenditures in GDP, and a high degree of\ninternational integration whether measured in terms of trade shares or in terms of the SW-WH index\nof openness. By comparison, investment rates have been significantly lower in South Asia and the\ndegree of international integration has been quite a bit less.  Indeed, South Asia is less integrated\nthan any other developing region in the world including sub-Saharan Africa. However, the share\nof government expenditures has been comparable to that of ESA.\nSouth Asia also shows up performing poorly on our measure of governance (where lower values\nreflect worse governance). Only sub-Saharan Africa comes up with a poorer level of governance.\nOn political freedom, however, South Asia does not perform too badly. In terms of the index of\npolitical freedom, whereby lower values reflect more political freedom, South Asia is found to have\non average greater political freedom than ESA 7, sub-Saharan Africa, and Middle East and North\nAfrica.\nIn summary, region-specific averages indicate that among developing regions where poverty\nis still a significant problem, ESA 7 has done the best job in reducing poverty.

An examination of changes in poverty by country, shown\nin column 3 of Table 2, reveals, for example, that while Latin America\u2019s performance in reducing\npoverty may have been lackluster on average over the 1990s, some individual Latin American\ncountries did quite well in reducing poverty. For example, Mexico reduced poverty rates by 20\npercentage points over the 1990s.  This performance is comparable to the poverty reduction record\nof Vietnam and PRC. In contrast, the examination of changes in poverty in major African countries\nreveals that their performance has been much worse than that of the average country in that region.\nSimilarly, it can be seen that ESA 7\u2019s high investment shares are driven mainly by the extraordinarily\nhigh values registered by PRC, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. On the other, hand, Philippines,\nViet Nam, and especially Cambodia are marked by investment shares that are much lower than the\naverage for this region. On governance, although South Asia registers a weak score, disaggregating\nthe numbers by country, we see that the weak score is driven to a large degree by the very low\nscores for Bangladesh and Pakistan.\nWe now turn to the Doing Business measures of business regulation. What is interesting to\nnote is the wide variance in the values taken by the various business regulation variables across\nthe countries. Singapore is found to have the least cumbersome regulations governing entry and\nexit of businesses and labor issues in Asia. Singapore\u2019s regulations even compare favorably with\nthe most developed countries in the world. By contrast, starting a business in Cambodia, India,\nand Indonesia is found to entail far more time; the relative costs for starting to business are also\nfar higher, especially in Cambodia and Indonesia.  Similarly, while it takes less than a year to close\na business in Singapore it takes as long as 10 years to do so in India! This can represent a\nconsiderable wastage of capital\u2014both physical as well as entrepreneurial\u2014as the capital waits\nto get redeployed from a failing business to an alternative one. Next, while three countries in the\nregion have few restrictions on the hiring of workers (for example, they do not disallow the usage\nof fixed term contracts for particular types of tasks) a number of other countries in the region,\nincluding Indonesia; Pakistan; Taipei,China; and Thailand put considerable restrictions on the types\nof contracts that can be used to hire workers.  Interestingly, virtually every country, with the notable\nexception of Singapore from developing Asia, puts in place restrictions on firing workers. These\nrestrictions are especially severe in India and Nepal followed by Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Viet\nNam.  Finally, while firing workers entails a cost of four weeks of wages for firms in Singapore,\nthis can be as high as 157 weeks in the case of Indonesia and 108 weeks in the case of Sri Lanka.\nIn what follows, we implement growth and poverty regressions involving the various variables\nwe have discussed above including business regulation variables provided in the Doing Business\ndatabase.  In this way we are able to determine whether and how these variables are related to\neconomic growth and poverty.\nB. Growth Regressions\nTables 4a\u20137 present the results of our growth regressions. Tables 4a-6b come in two versions.\nIn Tables 4a, 5a, and 6a the Doing Business variables enter the regression equation expressed\nas principal components. In contrast, in Tables 4b, 5b, and 6b they appear in terms of the actual\nvalues taken by the individual regulatory measures, for example, as numbers of procedures, duration\nor time, and costs of starting a business, etc. While Tables 4a and 4b only introduce measures\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 82 19", "INSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES FOR GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION:\nTHE ROLE OF PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT\nRANA HASAN, DEVASHISH MITRA, AND MEHMET ULUBASOGLU\nof governance, political freedom, and the Doing Business measures as explanatory variables, Tables\n5a\u20136b also introduce measures of openness and the size of public sector as elements of the overall,\neconomywide policy setup. Initial income is included in every regression equation we run.10\nConsider first the effect of governance on growth. As noted earlier, the variable governance\nis the principal component aggregation of the rule of law, government efficiency, and corruption\nvariables of Kaufman et al. As is clearly seen in all tables, regardless of the controls used, governance\nis strongly significant at the 1% level with a robust positive sign. What is its quantitative impact\non growth?  Consider the first column of Table 4a where the coefficient of governance is 1.37.\nThis implies that, holding all else constant, an improvement in governance from the value registered\nby Cambodia (the lowest in Asia) to the value registered by Singapore (not only the best in Asia\nbut the best in the world) would lead to a 7.5 percentage point increase in the growth rate. This\nis clearly a dramatic effect. On the other hand, political freedom is mostly insignificant across\nspecifications. In the few instances in which political freedom enters significantly, it shows up\nwith a positive sign. Since larger values of political freedom imply a more authoritarian regime,\nthis suggests that controlling for initial income, governance, and other variables, greater political\nfreedom has been weakly associated with lower economic growth. This would be consistent with\nrecent work that has stressed the importance of good governance as distinct from political freedom\nbeing critical for driving economic growth (Glaeser et al. 2004).\nAs noted earlier, we introduced the Doing Business variables into the growth regressions in\nterms of two broad approaches. One approach aggregates individual variables in various\ncombinations using principal component analysis. First, we aggregate the individual measures of\nbusiness regulation relating to starting and closing a business and labor issues with the principal\ncomponent method using the various individual measures in different combinations. Higher values\nof the principal component variables reflect more cumbersome regulations. Tables 4a, 5a, and 6a\ndescribed these results. \u201cDoing Business \u2013 1\u201d is the principal component aggregation of the number\nof procedures, costs, and the time for starting a business; and the costs and the time required\nfor closing a business.  The most notable result is that this \u201csuper-aggregated\u201d variable is estimated\nwith a negative and significant (at 10%) coefficient when governance is not in the regression;\nbut in the presence of governance the coefficient becomes insignificant. Exactly the same result\nholds for \u201cDoing Business \u2013 2\u201d, which also includes in the principal component aggregation of\n\u201cDoing Business \u2013 1\u201d, indexes of difficulties in hiring and firing workers and a measure of the\nmonetary costs of firing workers.\nA less aggregated approach is also used for constructing principal component variables. \u201cStart\u201d\nis the principal component aggregation of the number of procedures, costs, and the time needed\nfor starting a business; \u201cclose\u201d is the principal component  aggregation of the costs and the time\nrequired for closing a business; and \u201clabor\u201d is the principal component aggregation of indexes\nof difficulties in hiring and firing workers and the costs associated with firing workers. We employ\nthese variables both separately and jointly in the regressions. All of them are estimated to be\ninsignificant in the regressions, except one case of \u201cclose\u201d where it is employed individually and\n10 From all these tables, we see that there is some evidence of conditional convergence, depending on the controls\nused. In other words, in some cases the logarithm of the initial per capita income has a negative sign and is significant.\nThe evidence is not so strong as our sample consists of only the time period 1990\u20131999 (due to the institutional\ndata availability). The Asian financial crisis took place toward the end of this period and may have interfered with\nconvergence effects among countries.\n20 JULY 2006", "SECTION VI\nRESULTS\nTABLE 4A\nPER CAPITA INCOME GROWTH: INSTITUTIONS AND BUSINESS REGULATIONS I\nPER CAPITA INCOME GROWTH\nInitial Income -1.073 0.080 0.009 -0.008 0.067 0.100 0.126 0.008\n(4.06)*** (0.49) (0.07) (0.06) (0.48) (0.82) (1.05) (0.05)\nGovernance 1.371\n(5.27)***\nPolitical Freedom -0.224\n(1.07)\nDoing Business \u2013 1 -0.318\n(1.86)*\nDoing Business \u2013 2 -0.300\n(1.71)*\nStart -0.289 -0.212\n(1.39) (0.96)\nClose -0.266 0.167\n(1.62) (0.96)\nLabor -0.217 -0.133\n(1.13) (0.68)\nConstant 9.613 1.259 1.103 1.239 0.626 0.406 0.184 1.226\n(4.70)*** (0.71) (0.97) (1.08) (0.56) (0.39) (0.19) (1.04)\nObservations 116 131 112 112 115 112 115 112\nAdjusted R-squared 0.24 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01\nNote: Robust t statistics in parentheses.\n* significant at 10%;

In other words, regulations that\nmake it more difficult to close a business are associated with lower growth.\nA second approach to introducing the Doing Business variables is to use the actual values\ntaken by the various measures of regulation. It is useful to recall that as the values of these variables\nrise, regulations become more cumbersome. The key findings are as follows. Most notably, starting\ncost is robustly significant at the 1% level with a negative sign, both with and without the\ngovernance and the political freedom variables in the regressions. The coefficient is estimated\nconsistently to be around \u20130.005. This implies that holding all else constant, a decline in starting\ncosts from the levels recorded for Cambodia (by far the highest in Asia) to those recorded for\nthe United States (among the lowest in the world) would lead to a 2.4 percentage point increase\nin growth rates. Starting procedures, however, has unxpectedly a positive and significant (at 10%)\nsign in one case (Table 4b) so that an increase in starting procedures is associated with an increase\nin growth rates.  However, the impact of this variable is not very robust. When government expenditure\nand openness are controlled for (as in Tables 5b and 6b), the impact of starting procedures turns\nto be insignificant. Starting time is in all cases estimated as insignificant.\nClosing time and closing costs are estimated insignificant in all cases as well. However, firing\ncosts have the same result as starting procedures: a positive and significant (at 10%) sign in one\ncase (Table 4b) so that the higher the firing costs, the higher the growth. But again, when\ngovernment expenditure and trade policy are controlled for, this sign turns to be insignificant\n(as in Tables 5b and 6b).\nCumbersome labor hiring regulations have a negative and significant impact (at the 5% level)\non growth in the absence of the governance and political freedom variables as controls.11 The\ncoefficient on labor hiring implies that, holding all else constant, moving from the level of difficulties\nin hiring regulations seen in Pakistan (the most difficult in Asia) to those in Singapore or Sri Lanka\n(the least difficult) would lead to an increase in growth of about 1.25\u20131.4 percentage points.\nInterestingly, difficulties in firing labor always appear with a negative sign, implying that the greater\nregulatory barriers to firing workers are associated with lower economic growth.  However, the effect\nis typically found to have an insignificant impact on growth, the exception being when governance,\npolitical freedom, and investment variables are jointly controlled for in the regression. In this\ncase regulatory restrictions on firing workers have a negative and significant coefficient at 10%.\nThe results with the Doing Business variables imply that there is some evidence that private\nsector regulations have an impact on growth.  But the results also suggest that it is not individual\ncomponents of the set of regulations but the overall package that is more important.  In other\nwords, there could be several alternative combinations of various regulations that might result\nin a given growth rate, and this results in the significance of the overall index and not the individual\ncomponents. Also, it is only through better governance that better packages of regulations can\nbe delivered, and therefore controlling for the former takes away the effect of the latter.\nFrom our regressions, we cannot really say that openness as measured by the share of trade\nin GDP has any systematic effect on the growth rate of an economy. In most of the regressions,\nthis variable is insignificant. The impact of openness, however, is often positive when we use the\n11 This suggests that the influence of labor hiring on growth works through these variables.\n28 JULY 2006", "SECTION VI\nRESULTS\nSachs-Warner index of openness updated by Wacziarg and Welch (SWWH). When this index is\nsignificant, the coefficient is estimated to be between 1.5\u20131.7. This implies that completely open\nregimes\u2014such as that of Singapore (SWWH index = 1)\u2014have, on average, growth rates that are\n1.5\u20131.7 percentage points higher than those of closed regimes such as that of India  (SWWH index\n= 0). However, very interestingly, the significance of SWWH is conditional upon the absence of\nthe governance variable in the regression. There are two possible reasons for this conditional\nsignificance of the SWWH dummy. Firstly, the opening of the trade regime, as shown by the SWWH\ndummy, captures more than trade liberalization; it involves a higher scale policy reform and\ninstitutional changes.12 Secondly, the governance variable itself could capture trade policy if good\ntrade policy itself is an integral part of good governance. A possible implication of this conditional\nsignificance of the trade policy variable is that all well-governed economies are open to trade but\nnot all open economies are well governed; and that openness, in the absence of good governance,\nis irrelevant for economic growth.\nLastly, we consider the size of public sector, as measured by the share of government\nexpenditure in GDP, and trade policy variables. In almost all our growth regressions, government\nexpenditure is negative and significant. This means that the larger the size of the public sector\nrelative to the overall economy, the lower is the growth rate. While the public sector provides\ninfrastructure essential to the proper functioning of the private sector, an increase in its size could\nalso portend a reduction in the more dynamic component of the economy, namely the private sector.\nAlso, the public sector may breed corruption and inefficiency, and increase the incentives for\nunproductive activities such as lobbying. We see from our regressions that a percentage point\nincrease in the share of the public sector is generally associated with a 0.1\u20130.15 percentage point\nreduction in the growth rate.\nAs one can see, our regressions, except the ones presented in Table 7, do not include INV\n(investment as a share of GDP) as a right-hand side variable. The reason is that our institutional,\npolicy, and governance variables may affect growth through their effect on investment as well as\nindependently of it. In the former case, we would like to allow the parameter estimates of the policy\nand institutional variables to capture their full role in the determination of growth through all\npossible mechanisms. But as we clearly see in Table 7, there is no drastic change in the impact\nof policy and institutional variable on growth when INV is controlled for in the regressions as\ncompared to the results reported in Table 6b. The results for government expenditure, SWWH,\ngovernance, and starting costs are qualitatively the same.  There are only three changes over previous\nresults.  First, although countries that lack political freedom continue to tend toward having higher\ngrowth rates, this effect is not statistically significant in any specification. Similarly, restrictions\non hiring workers now do not show up with a significant negative impact on growth.  Both suggest\nthat the impact of these variables on growth work through their (positive) effect on investment\nrates.  Interestingly, however, there is some evidence now that restrictions on labor firing can have\na negative and significant impact on growth (last column). The coefficient of \u20130.014 implies that\nholding all else constant, moving from a regime such as that of India (difficulty of firing worker\nindex = 90) to that of Singapore (index equal 0) would add 1.26 percentage points to growth\nrates.\n12Rodriguez and Rodrik (2001) note that the SW dummy is a better measure of institutional change than being a trade\npolicy indicator.\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 82 29", "INSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES FOR GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION:\nTHE ROLE OF PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT\nRANA HASAN, DEVASHISH MITRA, AND MEHMET ULUBASOGLU\nAs for the impact of investment on growth, as can be seen from examining Table 7, investment\nhas a positive and robust effect on growth. This is consistent with the old Harrod-Domar type as\nwell as Mahalanobis type growth models. It is also consistent with the prediction of recent\nendogenous growth theories. Additionally, Easterly and Levine (1997) find that among nearly 50\nvariables considered in growth regressions, the most robust effect is that of investment. A high\nrate of investment helps build up the economy\u2019s future capacity to produce, and hence results\nin higher growth. We see from our regressions reported in Table 7 that a 15 percentage point increase\nin the investment rate\u2014the difference in investment rates across the PRC and India\u2014can bring\nabout a 1.2\u20132.1 percentage point increase in the growth rate depending on the particular\nspecification employed.\n In sum, a lot of the cross-country differences in growth can be explained by differences in\ngovernance quality, investment, and size of the public sector. Since good governance should lead\nto good policies, and we do not see good (bad) policies when the quality of governance is poor\n(good), policies do not exhibit an independent impact on growth. Additionally, policies will be\neffective for growth as long as the institutional framework allows them to do so. However, investment\nand public sector size do seem to matter for growth independently of institutions, as they may\nnot entirely be a function of the nature, quality, and style of governance.  While savings, and\ntherefore investment rates, also depend on rates of time preference and intergenerational altruism\nof households, the size of the public sector depends on the government\u2019s inequality aversion and\nits concern for unemployment reduction. In other words, it is possible to have good governments\nboth to the left and right of center, and they may resolve the equity\u2013efficiency trade-offs in different\nways.\nC. Poverty Regressions\nTables 8 through 10 are our poverty regressions. Table 8 includes as regressors only our\ninstitutional variables (governance and political freedom) and the Doing Business variables\nintroduced in terms of the two approaches noted above (that is, in terms of various principal\ncomponent aggregations as well as values taken up by the individual measures). Table 9 introduces\nthe share of government expenditure as well as trade shares as a measure of openness, while Table\n10 uses the SWWH index as a measure of openness in place of trade shares.  Initial income is included\nin all specifications.13\nA notable result and one that is very different from the growth regressions above is that the\npoverty regressions mostly fail to produce significant estimates for the governance variable. However,\nit should be mentioned that the sign of the governance variable is always negative, indicating\nthat better governance has been associated with lower poverty levels. Moreover, in the one case\nwhere governance does show up with a statistically significant impact\u2014the case where government\nexpenditure, trade policy as measured by the SWWH index, and closing time and costs are jointly\ncontrolled for (Table 10)\u2014the \u201ceconomic\u201d impact of governance can be very large.

As for political freedom,\nthis variable is estimated to be insignificant in all cases, a case generally in concurrence with the\ngrowth regressions.\nInterestingly, \u201cDoing Business \u2013 1\u201d is estimated to be significant in all cases at levels varying\nbetween 5\u201310%. The average of the coefficient is 3.4. \u201cDoing Business \u2013 2\u201d, however, is estimated\nas insignificant in all regressions. Recall that this variable includes \u201cstart\u201d, \u201cclose\u201d and \u201clabor\u201d\nin its aggregation, suggesting that something regarding the labor regulations is working against\nthe Doing Business \u2013 1 variable. This can be confirmed by examining the business regulation variables\non a more disaggregated basis. Indeed, as suggested by column 7 of Table 8, which reports the\nresults from principal component aggregations of Doing Business variables by separate \u201cstart\u201d,\n\u201cclose\u201d and \u201clabor\u201d groupings, the significant impact of Doing Business \u2013 1 on poverty is driven\nby regulations having to do with starting businesses. Regulations associated with closing businesses\nalso matter in the same direction, that is, an increase in regulations is associated with greater\npoverty, albeit not significantly so. However, increased regulations relating to labor are associated\nwith lower poverty (though not significantly so).\nTo get a better sense of which specific types of regulations affect poverty, we can turn to\nthe remainder of the results that are based on including the Doing Business variables in terms\nof the values taken by individual measures of regulation. Starting costs are estimated to have a\nrobust adverse impact on poverty in all cases, significant at 1% level. The coefficient centers on\n0.055. To get a sense of the quantitative impact of this variable on poverty we can note that a\nreduction in starting costs from the levels registered in Cambodia (by far the highest in Asia and\nperhaps the world) to levels registered in the United States would, holding all else constant, lead\nto a decline in poverty rates of 26.4 percentage points. Taking less extreme values, we can note\nthat a reduction in starting costs from the levels registered in Indonesia to levels registered by\nits Southeast Asian neighbor, Thailand, would lead to a reduction in poverty rates of 6.8 percentage\npoints. Clearly, this is not a trivial decline. In contrast to starting costs, starting procedures and\nstarting time are estimated to be insignificant in affecting poverty.\nAs for closing regulations, while the estimate for closing time is always insignificant closing\ncost is estimated to have some impact on poverty, with a positive sign that is significant between\n5-10% levels. Focusing on the statistically significant estimates, a decline in closing costs from\nlevels registered in the Philippines, where among Asian countries they are the highest, to a level\nregistered by Pakistan, among the lowest in Asia, would lead to a decline of around 8.8\u20139.9\npercentage points in poverty rates holding all else constant. Lowering closing costs to levels\nregistered in Singapore would lead to even lower poverty rates.\nAmong labor regulations variables, firing costs enter with a negative sign, which in some\ncases are significant at the 5\u201310% levels. This is interesting, as it implies that an increase in firing\ncosts decreases poverty. Thus, while higher firing costs may be a detriment to investments, our\nresults are consistent with the notion that higher firing costs lead firms to either fire workers in\nlesser numbers or that the various payments that firms must make to workers they are firing helps\nthem from falling into poverty. On the other hand, difficulties with hiring and firing regulations\nseem not to have any impact on poverty. Overall, except for the firing costs results, the results\nwith disaggregated Doing Business variables are in line with the results for the growth regressions.\n34 JULY 2006", "SECTION VII\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe impact of openness on poverty depends crucially on which measure of openness is used.\nIn striking contrast to the results from the growth regressions, we find that larger trade shares\nare often associated with lower poverty while a higher value of the SWWH index of openness is\nalways insignificantly related to poverty. These results suggest that while a more open trade policy\nmay not lead to significantly lower poverty, countries that have managed to increase trading volumes\nrelative to their GDP have often done so with benefits flowing to the poor. This is not as weak\na result as some may claim. For example, media reports sometimes claim that trade has benefited\ncountries at the expense of their poor. Our results here do not lend support to such reports.\nInterestingly, the particular measure of openness used also has an important bearing on the\nestimated impact of government expenditures on poverty. When trade shares are used as the measure\nof openness, increased government expenditures show up with a positive and significant impact\non poverty. In other words, a larger public sector (as proxied by government expenditures) is\nsignificantly associated with higher poverty.  However, moving to the SWWH index of openness\ncompletely wipes out the statistical significance on the coefficient of government expenditures.\nThis is understandable, as large government expenditures are a sign of fiscal irresponsibility and\nthe SWWH captures macroeconomic/fiscal reforms that accompany most trade reforms (see Rodriguez\nand Rodrik 2001).\nIn sum, initial income, \u201cDoing-Business \u2013 1\u201d and starting costs turn out to be the important\nvariables that matter for poverty.  In some contrast to the results for the growth regressions, this\nsuggests more room for policies that could fuel private sector activities in the economy. The fact\nthat governance and political freedom variables are mostly insignificant suggests that governments\nof the same quality can resolve the equity\u2013efficiency trade-offs in different ways. Noting that\ngovernance is always significant in growth regressions, this further suggests that the actions to\nbe taken to reduce poverty are quicker than those to increase steady-state growth, which requires\ninstitutional modification.\nVII. CONCLUDING REMARKS\nIn this paper, we have studied the role of institutions and policies in driving economic growth\nand explaining poverty, paying close attention to institutions and policies that relate to the overall\nclimate and regulations under which the private sector operates. We find that good governance\nas measured by a strong commitment to the rule of law among other things, matters for poverty\nreduction largely through its effect on economic growth. While the impact of trade openness on\ngrowth is not clear, increases in trade shares have been associated with lower poverty. Furthermore,\nthe size of the public sector has a strong negative effect on growth and can be bad for poverty\nalleviation. While a large public sector can be an asset to the rest of the economy in terms of the\ninfrastructure and social services it provides, it also means that the economy has a relatively smaller\nprivate sector, usually the more dynamic sector. We interpret our regressions to show that in most\ncountries, growth is driven by the dynamism of the private sector, which in turn depends importantly\non the quality of governance.\nLess cumbersome regulations governing private sector operations, especially those pertaining\nto starting a business, matter for both economic growth as well as poverty reduction more directly.\nHowever, it is important to point out that eliminating cumbersome regulations is unlikely to serve\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 82 35", "INSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES FOR GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION:\nTHE ROLE OF PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT\nRANA HASAN, DEVASHISH MITRA, AND MEHMET ULUBASOGLU\nas a panacea.  There are no doubt regulatory practices that are at best inefficient and at worst\nperhaps fostering serious corruption. Eliminating such practices will probably be good for both\nbusiness as well as economy and for the poor. Our results on starting costs, in particular, are certainly\nconsistent with this notion. At the same time, policymakers must not lose sight of the fact that\nspurring the private sector is unlikely to be driven by the elimination or alleviation of \u201cgovernment\nfailures.\u201d  Spurring the private sector will also require the elimination or alleviation of market failures\nthrough appropriately designed public\u2013private partnerships. The critical challenge for private sector\ndevelopment is probably getting this design correct.  More research in uncovering the nature and\nprocesses that can lead to more effective public-private partnerships is likely to be a higher value-\nadded activity. It is also one that is likely to require in-depth, country-specific studies.\nFinally, political freedom is not associated with either higher growth or lower poverty.  Indeed,\nthe evidence here seems to suggest that the delivery of good governance and regulations that\nfacilitate the creation of new enterprises are more relevant for growth and poverty reduction than\nthe nature of the political system per se.\nSELECTED REFERENCES\nAcemoglu, D., J.
