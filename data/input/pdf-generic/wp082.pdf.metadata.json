Despite many success stories,\nAsia and the Pacific remains home to two thirds of the world\u2019s poor. ADB is a multilateral development\nfinance institution owned by 64 members, 46 from the region and 18 from other parts of the globe.\nADB\u2019s vision is a region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member countries reduce\npoverty and improve the quality of life of their citizens.\n\nADB\u2019s main instruments for providing help to its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans,\ntechnical assistance, grants, guarantees, and equity investments. ADB\u2019s annual lending volume is typically\nabout $6 billion, with technical assistance usually totaling about $180 million a year.\n\nADB\u2019s headquarters is in Manila. It has 26 offices around the world and has more than 2,000 employees\nfrom over 50 countries.\n\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/economics\nISSN: 1655-5252\nPublication Stock No.\n\nPrinted in the Philippines\n\nERD\n\nECONOMICS AND RESEARCH DEPARTMENT\n\nWorking Paper\nSERIES\nNo.82\n\nInstitutions and Policies for\nInstitutions and Policies for\nGrowth and Poverty Reduction:\nGrowth and Poverty Reduction:\nThe Role of Private Sector\nThe Role of Private Sector\nDevelopment\nDevelopment\n\nRana Hasan, Devashish Mitra,\nand Mehmet Ulubasoglu\n\nJuly 2006\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 82\n\nINSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES FOR GROWTH\nAND POVERTY REDUCTION:\nTHE ROLE OF PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT\n\nRANA HASAN, DEVASHISH MITRA, AND MEHMET ULUBASOGLU\n\nJuly 2006\n\nRana Hasan is Senior Economist in the Development Indicators and Policy Research Division of the Economics and\nResearch Department, Asian Development Bank; Devashish Mitra is Professor of Economics and Gerald B. and Daphna\nCramer Professor of Global Affairs at the The Maxwell School of Citizenship & Public Affairs, Syracuse University; and\nMehmet A.

Furthermore, the size\nof the public sector has a strong negative effect on growth and can be bad for\npoverty alleviation. Finally, political freedom is not associated with either higher\ngrowth  or  lower  poverty.  Taken  together,  the  evidence  here  suggests  that  the\ndelivery  of  good  governance  and  regulations,  which  facilitate  the  creation  of\nnew  enterprises,  is  more  relevant  for  growth  and  poverty  reduction  than  the\nnature  of  the  political  system  per  se.\n\n\fI. INTRODUCTION\n\nDespite having made significant progress in reducing poverty over the last several decades,\n690 million people, constituting  more than a fifth of Asia\u2019s population, live below the $1-a-day\npoverty line (ADB 2004). On the basis of poverty lines more typically found in low-to-middle income\ncountries  as  opposed  to  only  low  income  countries\u2014the  $2-a-day  poverty  line\u2014an  even  more\nstaggering number are poor in Asia:  60% of Asia\u2019s population or 1.9 billion people. Faced with\nsuch numbers, it is difficult to argue with the notion that the reduction of poverty is the central\ndevelopment  challenge  facing  Asia,  and  indeed,  the  developing  world  at  large.\n\nWhat  can  policymakers  do  to  reduce  poverty?  Many  economists  would  argue  that  igniting\neconomic growth and sustaining it is the surest and most sustainable way to fight poverty.  Figure\n1, which plots cross-country data on economic growth and poverty reduction, is consistent with\nthis argument.1 This figure shows, for example, that a 1% increase in growth has been associated\non average with a 1.5% reduction in poverty. Moreover, episodes where poverty grew despite economic\ngrowth  (quadrant  1)  or  where  poverty  declined  despite  economic  contraction  (quadrant  3)  are\nclearly the minority. But Figure 1 also reveals that there is a great deal of variation in how much\neconomic growth has reduced poverty across countries and even within countries over different\nperiods  of  time.  In  statistical  terms,  the  variation  in  economic  growth  can  explain  only  around\n45%  of  the  variation  in  poverty  reduction  (ADB  2004).\n\nFIGURE 1\nGROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION\n\n)\n\n%\n\n(\n \ny\nt\nr\ne\nv\no\np\n \nf\no\n \ne\nt\na\nr\n \nh\nt\nw\no\nr\ng\n \nl\na\nu\nn\nn\nA\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n-40\n\n-60\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nAnnual growth rate of mean income (%)\n\n1  Poverty reduction is based on changes in $1-a-day poverty rates.

First, what are the policies and institutions that can ignite and thereafter\nsustain growth. Second, how does one ensure that growth generates significant opportunities for\nthe poor.  In this paper, we discuss the evidence on both of these questions, paying special attention\nto policies and institutions that relate to the development of the private sector.  In doing so, we\nare  informed  not  only  by  existing  cross-country  studies  examining  the  impact  of  policies  and\ninstitutions on economic growth and poverty, we also carry out empirical analysis of our own using\nnewly  available  data  on  poverty  (World  Bank-PovcalNet  and  ADB  2004)  and  indicators  relating\nto  the  regulations  under  which  the  private  sector  operates  (World  Bank  2004).\n\nOur focus on private sector development stems from the now widespread belief that market\nforces  and  private  initiative  provide  a  powerful  basis  for  generating  economic  growth  and\ndevelopment. This belief explains the importance private sector development is receiving in the\nstrategies  being  adopted  by  both  developing  country  policymakers  as  well  as  international\ndevelopment  agencies.  From  the  perspective  of developing  country  policy  making,  for  example,\nscores of countries have moved over the last 10 to 20 years to liberalize their trade and industrial\npolicy  regimes.  These  liberalizations  have  been  underpinned  by  the  belief  that  greater  reliance\non private agents\u2014including not only large-scale manufacturing firms but also farmers and micro-\nentrepreneurs\u2014to  allocate  resources  on  the  basis  of  market  signals  would  improve  economic\nperformance.  Similarly, development agencies, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and\nthe World Bank, have made support to private sector development a key component of their overall\nstrategy  for  assisting  less  developed  countries.  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  development  strategy  (ADB\n2000), notes right at the outset that the \u201cdevelopment of a strong and dynamic private sector\nis crucial to long-term, rapid economic growth.\u201d  Long term, rapid economic growth is in turn seen\nas  a  \u201cnecessary  condition  for  sustained  poverty  reduction.\u201d\n\nThe policies and institutions we focus on can be distinguished into four types.  A first type\nrelates to the various regulatory barriers faced by actual and potential private sector firms.  These\nfactors are measured in terms of variables available from the Doing Business database of the World\nBank  (World  Bank  2004a).  Examples  include  information  on  the  ease  of  starting  and  closing\nbusinesses. A second type consists of broader outcome-based measures of overall policy orientations\nof the government that may affect the way businesses operate. These are captured by measures\nof openness to trade and the size of the public sector. While the former relates directly to how\nmuch domestic firms are exposed to foreign competition (via imports) and foreign markets (via\nexports), the latter captures quantitatively how important the private sector is in overall production.\nA third type relates to the institutions of governance. As is now increasingly appreciated, the most\nencouraging  regulations  (on  paper)  may  not  amount  to  much  in  terms  of  creating  an  enabling\nenvironment for the private sector if those regulations were enforced capriciously or by a predatory\nstate machinery. Thus it is important to take into account the policy and institutional environment\nrelated to governance.  A final set of variables relate to political institutions, in particular to political\nrights  and  civil  liberties.\n\nThe results of our empirical work can be summarized as follows. We find that good governance\nas  measured  by  a  strong  commitment  to  the  rule  of  law,  a  competent  and  efficient  government\nsector, and control of corruption matters for poverty reduction largely through its effect on economic\ngrowth. Though not a panacea, less cumbersome regulations governing private sector operations,\nespecially those pertaining to starting a business, matter for both economic growth as well as poverty\n\n2\n\nJULY 2006\n\n\fSECTION II\nINSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES AND WHY THEY MATTER\nFOR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE\n\nreduction more directly. While the impact of trade openness on growth is not clear, increases in\ntrade shares have been associated with lower poverty. Furthermore, the size of the public sector\nhas a strong negative effect on growth and can be bad for poverty alleviation. Finally, political\nfreedom is not associated with either higher growth or lower poverty.  Taken together, the evidence\nhere  seems  to  suggest  that  the  delivery  of  good  governance  and  regulations  that  facilitate  the\ncreation of new enterprises are more relevant for growth and poverty reduction than the nature\nof  the  political  system  through  which  such  governance  and  regulations  are  delivered.\n\nThe  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Section  II  provides  a  brief  discussion  on  policies  and\ninstitutions for private sector development and why these should matter for economic performance\nand thus  economic development. Section  III reviews the  related  literature.  Section  IV describes\nthe  methodology  and  Section  V  the  data  and  their  sources.  Section  VI  provides  an  in-depth\ndescription  and  discussion  of  results.  Section  VII  concludes.\n\nII. INSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES AND WHY THEY MATTER\nFOR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE\n\nThe dividing line between institutions and policies is thin. Nevertheless, it is useful to try\nand distinguish between them for purposes of understanding their roles in improving economic\nperformance.  One basis for distinguishing between the two is that institutions encompass the formal\nand informal rules and customs within which individuals and firms operate; policies, on the other\nhand,  refer  to  various  strategies  and  measures  a  government  adopts  to  achieve  its  goals  and\nobjectives within a country\u2019s institutional framework (Quibria 2002).  Of course, policies can have\na profound impact on a country\u2019s institutions, and this is ultimately what the objective of the efforts\nat policy reform in developing countries is about.  In what follows, we discuss in more detail what\ninstitutions are, what they encompass, and why they are important to economic functioning and\nperformance.  We also briefly cover key policies that may have an important bearing on economic\nperformance  and  on  the  process  of  institutional  change  itself.\n\nA.\n\nInstitutions\n\nThe work of Douglas North has been an important influence on economists\u2019 thinking about\ninstitutions  and  their  linkages  with  economic  performance.  North  (1990)  describes  institutions\nas  the  \u201crules  of the  game\u201d  in  a  society.  In  his  words,  institutions  encompass  \u201chumanly  devised\nconstraints that shape human interaction.\u201d These constraints can be formal or informal. The former\nwould  include  constitutions,  laws,  and  regulations  governing  politics  and  economics,  while  the\nlatter would include conventions, customs, codes of behavior, and conduct. Formal rules and informal\nconstraints together determine the incentives in human exchange: political, social, and economic.\nImportantly, how well the given institutions function depends on the nature of enforcement, that\nis, how costly it is to identify violations of the \u201crules of the game\u201d and how severe the punishments\nfor  deviating  from  rules  are.\n\nWhy are institutions important to economic performance?  According to North, institutions\nhave  a  profound  influence  on  the  incentive  structure  of  a  society.  Countries  are  rich  or  poor\n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 82\n\n3\n\n\fINSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES FOR GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION:\nTHE ROLE OF PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT\nRANA HASAN, DEVASHISH MITRA, AND MEHMET ULUBASOGLU\n\ndepending on whether their institutional constraints define a set of payoffs to political and economic\nactivity that encourage productive activity. Put differently, when organizations, including firms,\ntrade unions, political parties, business associations, etc. are engaged in what are unproductive\nactivities it is because the institutional framework in which they operate provides them with an\nincentive to be unproductive. In developing countries the institutional framework \u201coverwhelmingly\nfavor activities that promote redistributive rather than productive activity, that create monopolies\nrather than competitive conditions, and that restrict opportunities rather than expand them. They\nseldom induce investment in education that increases productivity\u201d (North 1990, 9). In this way\ninstitutions affect both the process of capital accumulation as well as the process of converting\nthis  capital  into  output.\n\nIf developing countries are poor because their current institutions provide a weak basis for\nproviding the incentives that generate growth, what type of institutions should they acquire?  And\nhow can developing countries get there? Recent research has been in far more agreement on the\nfirst  of  these  questions  than  the  second.\n\nConsider the first question.  By and large, most economists today would assign a critical role\nto private incentives and initiatives in driving modern economic growth via the accumulation of\ncapital and the conversion of that capital and labor into marketable output.  Underlying this process\nof private accumulation, production, and exchange, however, has been a set of market-supporting\ninstitutions.  The  most  fundamental  among  these  have  been  the  existence  of  secure  and  stable\nproperty  rights  and  the  rule  of  law.  The  importance  of  these  was  clearly  noted  and  anticipated\nby  Adam  Smith  in  his  Wealth  of  Nations  (as  cited  in  Rodrik,  Subramanian,  and  Trebbi  2002,  1):\n\u201cCommerce and manufactures can seldom flourish long in any state which does not enjoy a regular\nadministration of justice, in which the people do not feel themselves secure in the possession of\ntheir property, in which the faith of contracts is not supported by law, and in which the authority\nof  the  state  is  not  supposed  to  be  regularly  employed  in  enforcing  the  payment  of  debts  from\nall those who are able to pay. Commerce and manufactures, in short, can seldom flourish in any\nstate in which there is not a certain degree of confidence in the justice of government.\u201d\n\nThe experience of today\u2019s prosperous countries therefore suggests that stable property rights\nand the rule of law are prerequisites for a dynamic private sector to emerge. However, their experience\nalso reveals that market economies require much more if they are to function efficiently and with\nat least a modicum of equity. As the experience of the 20th century has shown, market economies\nalso need fiscal and monetary institutions that perform stabilizing functions, institutions that try\nto check market failures and regulate conduct in all sorts of markets including those dealing with\ngoods and services, labor, and finance; and institutions that provide social insurance (Rodrik 1999).\n\nIt is difficult to imagine that today\u2019s developing countries, which are by and large transitioning\nto more fully market-based economic systems, will attain prosperity without these market-supporting\ninstitutions.  The acquisition of these institutions is therefore part of their developmental challenge.\nHowever, it is far from clear how poor countries should go about acquiring these institutions (and\nas  noted  below,  even  how  urgently  they  need  all  of  them).\n\nRodrik  (1999)  discusses  and  contrasts  two  alternative  approaches  to  the  acquisition  of\ninstitutions. According to the first, it is possible to \u201cimport [the] blueprint\u201d or institutional design\nfrom the developed world.  Following this approach the removal of price distortions and privatization\nof  enterprises  would  be  accompanied  by  a  set  of  \u201cgovernance\u201d  reforms  that  would  include  the\n\n4\n\nJULY 2006\n\n\fSECTION II\nINSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES AND WHY THEY MATTER\nFOR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE\n\nenactment  of  legal  codes  and  legislations  (often  in  line  with  those  existing  in  the  developed\ncountries),  establishment  of  an  independent  judiciary,  etc.\n\nThe second approach, however, emphasizes that local circumstances will require in many cases\na unique, context-specific institutional design. The usefulness and importance of such an approach\ncan be understood and appreciated through the very real caution suggested by North (1994, 8):\n\u201ceconomies that adopt the formal rules of another economy will have very different performance\ncharacteristics than the first economy because of different informal norms and enforcement.  The\nimplication  is  that  transferring  the  formal  political  and  economic  rules  of  successful  western\neconomies to Third World and Eastern European economies is not a sufficient condition for good\neconomic  performance.\u201d\n\nConsider the case of property rights and rule of law (investor perceptions of which are shown\nto be strongly associated with better economic performance as both our literature survey below\nas well as our own empirical work reveals). While strengthening property rights and rule of law\nin an economy where they have been weak or absent to begin with are very likely to be instrumental\nin getting entrepreneurs and investors to expand their investment activities, there is more than\none way to establish stronger property rights and respect for the rule of law.  An illustration from\nRodrik (2004), contrasting Russia in the 1990s with People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s (PRC) investment\nboom driven by the township and village enterprises in the 1980s (TVEs) reveals quite clearly the\ncomplexities involved in successful institutional change.  In the 1990s Russia provided its citizens\nwith  a  private  property  rights  regime  that  was  ostensibly  enforced  by  an  independent  judiciary.\nHowever, surveys routinely revealed that investors consistently gave low marks to the country insofar\nas rule of law was concerned. Why? While Russia made the appropriate legislative changes, weaknesses\nin enforcement and the actual codes of conduct to which Russians were accustomed to probably\ndiluted  the  effectiveness  of  these  changes.\n\nPut  differently,  context  matters  so  that  \u201cinstitutional  outcomes  do  not  map  into  unique\ninstitutional design.\u201d Consider now the case of the PRC. The investment booms in the PRC\u2019s TVEs\ntook  place  despite  the  nonexistence  of  a  private  property  regime  and  an  independent  judiciary.\nApparently, investors did believe their \u201cproperty\u201d to be safe. Drawing upon the work of Qian (2002),\nRodrik  (2004,  9)  points  to  what  may  have  served  to  provide  secure  property  rights  when  none\nactually  existed  formally:  with  local  governments  typically  the  owners  of  the  TVEs  and  private\nentrepreneurs as \u201ceffective\u201d partners, \u201cprivate entrepreneurs felt secure not because the government\nwas  prevented  from  expropriating  them,  but  because,  sharing  in  the  profits,  it  had  no  interest\nto  expropriate  them.\u201d\n\nFollowing the second approach\u2019s emphasis on local context, the general lesson is that \u201cthere\nis no unique, noncontext specific way of achieving desirable institutional outcomes.\u201d  This, of course,\nmakes it more difficult to give policy advice.  But Rodrik argues that while good institutions are\nultimately crucial for sustaining growth, igniting growth need not wait until large-scale institutional\ntransformation has been generated. Instead, igniting growth entails the easier task of being able\nto identify and relax specific constraints that are holding back the private sector. Thus, in the case\nof the PRC in the late 1970s and 1980s, the main \u201cbinding\u201d constraint to growth may have been\nthe absence of market-oriented incentives. Doing away with the household responsibility system\nand  allowing  local  governments  to  \u201cown\u201d  the  TVEs  were  innovations  that  gave  entrepreneurs\nincentives  to  be  productive  within  the  existing  overall  institutional  framework.  More  generally,\nthe  challenge  for  policy  then  becomes  the  search  for  responses  that  are  appropriate  for  local\n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 82\n\n5\n\n\fINSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES FOR GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION:\nTHE ROLE OF PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT\nRANA HASAN, DEVASHISH MITRA, AND MEHMET ULUBASOGLU\n\nconditions.  This in turn requires an encouragement of experimentation\u2014risks notwithstanding\u2014\nwith reforms of different elements of the current institutional framework to see what types of reforms\nwork  and  which  ones  do  not.\n\nB.\n\nPolicies\n\nPolicies can be thought of as the instruments by which governments can change the \u201crules\nof the game.\u201d Which policies have a particularly important bearing on economic performance?  More\nto the point, what policies are holding back the private sector? Until very recently policy advice\nfor generating growth and spurring the private sector tended to emphasize policy reforms focused\non  a  relatively  narrow  range  of  areas.  In  particular,  policy  reforms  have  been  targeted  toward\nmacroeconomic stabilization, price liberalizations, trade liberalizations, and the privatization of\npublic  sector  enterprises.\n\nUnfortunately,  undertaking  these  policy  reforms  has  not  led  to  a  big  expansion  in  private\nsector  activities;  conversely,  the  private  sectors  of  some  countries  that  have  avoided  the  above\nset of policy reforms have boomed (World Bank 2003). This has led analysts to look more closely\nat the full range of policies that influence the environment in which production takes place (as\nwell  as  the  institutional  framework  in  which  policies  operate).\n\nRodrik (2003) contrasts two views on the policies and processes that can get \u201centrepreneurs\nexcited about investing in the home economy.\u201d One view emphasizes cumbersome and misguided\ngovernment  regulations  as  the  constraint  to  entrepreneurship  and  a  vibrant  private  sector.  The\nsecond view emphasizes market imperfections in developing countries. Accordingly, the government\nshould not just get out of the way of the private sector. Instead it needs to find ways to crowd-\nin  private  investment.\n\nAccording to the first view, government imposed imperfections, which include: \u201cmacroeconomic\ninstability and high inflation, high government wages that distort the functioning of labor markets,\na large tax burden, arbitrary regulations, burdensome licensing requirements, corruption\u201d among\nothers are holding back the private sector. Surveys of enterprises, including the investment climate\nstudies  (ICS)  initiated  by  the  World  Bank  and  also  being  carried  out  by  the  ADB  become  a  key\ntool in determining which aspects of government policy and regulations constrain the operations\nand  growth  of  the  private  sector.\n\nPer the second view, however, \u201ceconomies can get stuck in the low-level equilibrium due to\nthe  nature  of  technology  and  markets,  even  when  government  policy  does  not  penalize\nentrepreneurship.\u201d Rodrik points out that even though developing countries need not create new\ntechnologies they do need to adapt technologies that are new to them.  This process of adaptation\nwill  usually  require  a  certain  amount  of  human  capital  internal  to  the  individual  and  the  firm\ncontemplating  use  of  the  new  technology.  But  crucially  both  the  costs  of  adaptation  as  well  as\nthe returns from adaptation are often subject to externalities. For example, the costs of producing\na new (for the developing countries) good may be uncertain. The uncertainties can deter investors.\nHowever,  even  one  investor\u2019s  entry  into  the  new  line  of  production  would  provide  information\non the costs. If the investor struggles, then this is a signal that the costs of production are high.\nIf the investor, on the other hand, is successful then this is a signal that the costs of production\nare worth the effort. The point is that \u201centrepreneurs engaged in the cost discovery process incur\n\n6\n\nJULY 2006\n\n\fSECTION III\nSURVEY OF RELATED LITERATURE\n\nprivate costs, but provide social benefits that can vastly exceed the anticipated profits.\u201d The end\neffect  is  that  \u201cthe  relevant  learning  is  under  produced  in  a  decentralized  equilibrium,  with  the\nconsequences being that the economy fails to diversify into non-traditional, more advanced lines\nof  activity.  In  such  a  scenario  there  will  be  policy  interventions  which  would  improve  upon  the\ndecentralized  outcome\u201d  (Rodrik  2003,  21).\n\nBoth of these views have merit. This is because both factors may be at work, even within the\nsame country. Thus while learning externalities may be holding back certain types of investments,\nother  investments  could  be  constrained  by  unnecessarily  burdensome  regulation.  Consider  the\nwide  range  of  regulatory  policies  that  govern  the  rules  and  regulations  on  starting  and  closing\na  business.  Cumbersome  and/or  costly  regulations  for  starting  a  business  could  easily  result  in\nlower entry than otherwise; they could also lead to a lack of competition faced by existing firms.\nThe  result  would  not  only  be  lower  investment  than  otherwise,  but  also  lower  efficiency  among\nincumbents protected from competition. Similarly, regulatory hurdles in closing a business would\nprevent firms that are currently inefficient from exiting the market. They may also deter entry by\nartificially raising the cost of exiting if market conditions ultimately prove to be too difficult for\na firm.\n\nA similar logic applies to labor market regulations.  Labor market regulations encompass a\nnumber  of  issues,  including  the  rules  governing  industrial  relations  and  collective  bargaining,\nhiring  and  firing  of  workers,  minimum  wage  laws,  health  and  safety  regulations,  and  mandated\nbenefits.  These regulations can have significant implications for both efficiency as well as equity.\nFor example, while restrictions on firing would protect the welfare of the employed, they may end\nup harming employment generation in general as firms respond to firing restrictions by reducing\nthe number of workers they would otherwise hire.  In an extreme case, strong restrictions to firing\ncould even end up constraining investments, especially in labor-intensive activities as has often\nbeen  claimed  in  the  case  of  India  (see,  for  example,  Besley  and  Burgess  2003).\n\nIII. SURVEY OF RELATED LITERATURE\n\nA.\n\nInstitutions, Policies, and Growth\n\nAs  may  be  alluded  from  the  previous  discussion,  the  work  by  North  (1990)  has  generated\na great deal of interest in the role of institutions in determining output and growth. Knack and\nKeefer  (1995)  looked  at  the  impact  of  property  rights  on  economic  growth.  In  particular,  they\nstudy the effects of contract enforceability and risk. While the variables are shown to have an impact\non growth, controlling for them generates estimates that show faster conditional convergence to\nincomes levels in the United States. In a subsequent paper, Keefer and Knack (1997) look at how\nthe convergence rate itself might be a function of indicators of institutional quality such as the\nrule  of  law,  corruption,  and  the  risk  of  expropriation  and  contract  repudiation.  They  study  this\nby interacting initial income with these institutional indicators on the right-hand side of a standard,\ncross-country  growth  regression.2\n\n2 Another paper that pursues this line of research is Rodrik (1997), which looks at the role of institutions in explaining\nthe stellar growth performance of East Asian economies prior to the Asian financial crisis. Almost all the variation\nin their growth performance is explained by initial income, initial education, and institutional quality. His measure\nof  institutional  quality  is  drawn  from  the  work  of  Knack  and  Keefer  (1995)  and  Easterly  and  Levine  (1996).\n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 82\n\n7\n\n\fINSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES FOR GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION:\nTHE ROLE OF PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT\nRANA HASAN, DEVASHISH MITRA, AND MEHMET ULUBASOGLU\n\nMauro (1995) focuses on the effect of corruption on growth and finds it to be negative in\nhis cross-country regressions. He also looks at the effects of a subjective perceptions-based index\nof bureaucratic efficiency as well as that of political stability and finds them to be positive. Due\nto the possibility of reverse causation from growth to institutions, there is a potential endogeneity\nproblem,  which  Mauro  corrects  by  instrumenting  corruption  by  an  index  of  ethnolinguistic\nfractionalization.\n\nAnother  important  study  is  by  Barro  (1997)  who  studies  a  panel  of  around  100  countries\nfrom 1960 to 1990. Using controls such as the initial level of real per capita gross domestic product\n(GDP), initial schooling, life expectancy, fertility, government consumption, inflation, and terms\nof trade, growth is found to be increasing in the rule of law. Although Barro finds a weak effect\nof political freedom on growth, there is some indication of a nonlinear relation, an inverted U-\nshaped relationship between democracy and growth, with the growth-maximizing level of political\nfreedom  lying  somewhere  in  between  a  pure  democracy  and  pure  dictatorship.\n\nUsing a new database consisting of 300 indicators of governance and creating six aggregates\nout  of  those,  namely  rule  of  law,  corruption,  political  instability,  voice  and  accountability,  and\ngovernment  efficiency  and  regulatory  burden,  Kaufmann,  Kraay,  and  Zoido-Lobaton  (1999)  show\nthat there is a strong association between good governance and growth, with the causation running\nfrom  the  former  to  the  latter.  The  instruments  they  use  for  their  governance  indicators  are  the\nones  used  by  Hall  and  Jones  (1999).\n\nWhile the above papers emphasize the effect of institutions on growth, later work has mainly\nemphasized the impact of institutions on income levels and not on growth rates. In support of\nthis change in emphasis, Hall and Jones (1999) have argued that \u201clevels capture the differences\nin long-run economic performance that are most directly relevant to welfare as measured by the\nconsumption of goods and services.\u201d Also, in this context they point to the recent evidence on\nthe transitional nature of growth rate differences across countries; the empirical questioning by\nJones  (1995)  of  the  relevance  of  endogenous  growth  models;  and  the  theoretical  support  from\nrecent models that show the effect of policies on income levels and not on growth rates, and where\ncountries  in  the  long  run  differ  in  their  income  levels  and  not  growth  rates.\n\nHall and  Jones (1999) look at how capital accumulation, productivity, and therefore output\nper  worker  are  affected  by  social  infrastructure.  Social  infrastructure  here  refers  to  institutional\nand policy variables that determine the economic environment determining capital accumulation,\nskill formation, invention, innovation and technology transfer. Their measure of social infrastructure\nis based on measures of corruption, expropriation risk, government repudiation of contracts, law\nand  order,  bureaucratic  quality,  and  trade  barriers.  While  output  is  made  a  function  of  social\ninfrastructure  in  their  estimation  framework,  they  correct  for  endogeneity  of  the  latter  using\ninstruments such as geographical variables, mainly distance from the equator and the extent to\nwhich modern European languages are spoken as first languages today, which captures European\ninfluences on institutions. Their study concludes that countries with better social infrastructure\nhave higher levels of output per worker in the long run, have higher investment rates, and are\nmore  efficient  at  converting  inputs  to  output.\n\nRecently,  a  major  advance  in  this  literature  has  been  made  by  Acemoglu,  Johnson,  and\nRobinson (2001) who looked at former European colonies to study the impact of institutions on\nper capita income levels. For these countries, they are able to use European settler mortality rates\nas  instruments  for  institutions.  In  countries  conquered  by  Europeans,  whether  they  decided  to\n\n8\n\nJULY 2006\n\n\fSECTION III\nSURVEY OF RELATED LITERATURE\n\npermanently settle or not was determined by their ability to survive there (by their mortality rates).\nIf they decided to settle in a country themselves, they adopted good institutions, while if they\ndecided to rule from their home country, they put in place extractive institutions. Their decision\nto settle in a region, however, was a function of their mortality there. On the other hand, mortality\nrates of potential settlers, to begin with, can be viewed as a function of geographical variables.\nWhile even after instrumenting for institutions (expropriation risk that current and potential investors\nface),  Acemoglu,  Johnson,  and  Robinson  find  statistically  significant  effects  of  these  variables\non per capita income in the expected direction, the instrumentation completely takes away the\neffect  of geographical  variables  on  income.\n\nTurning to trade policy, the effects of trade barriers on growth and income have been studied\nsince the early 1990s. While Dollar (1992), Sachs and Warner (1995), and Edwards (1998) showed\npositive effects of trade on growth using different measures of openness, in many cases constructed\nfrom standard policy measures, these papers have been strongly criticized by Rodriguez and Rodrik\n(2001) for the problems with measures of trade openness and the econometric techniques used,\nas well as for the difficulty in establishing the direction of causality. While Rodriguez and Rodrik\n(2001)  have  criticized  the  measure  of  openness  used  by  Sachs  and  Warner  (1995)  as  capturing\nmany aspects of the macroeconomic environment in addition to trade policy, Baldwin (2002) has\nrecently  defended  that  approach  on  the  grounds  that  the  other  policy  reforms  captured  in  the\nmeasure, though not trade reforms per se, accompany most trade reforms sponsored by international\ninstitutions. Therefore, using such a measure tells us the value of the entire package of trade and\naccompanying  reforms.  Wacziarg  and  Welch  (2003)  have  updated  the  Sachs-Warner  data  set  and\nhave  again  shown  the  benefit  of  such  reforms  in  driving  growth.\n\nJust as in the case of the literature on the effect of institutions as explained above, the trade\nliterature  has  also  shifted  focus  to  levels  from  growth  rates.  Frankel  and  Romer  (1999)  look  at\nthe effect of trade share in GDP on income levels across countries for the year 1985. They construct\nan  instrument  for  the  trade  share  by  summing  up  the  gravity-model  driven,  geography-based\npredicted values of bilateral trade flows across all trading partners. The variables used to predict\nbilateral  trade  flows  include  distance,  country  size  variables  such  as  land  area  and  population,\nand  dummies for whether the countries are landlocked or have a common border, etc. They find\nthat their instrumental variables approach produces positive effects of trade on income levels that\nare greater than the estimates produced by ordinary least squares. Irwin and Tervio (2002) apply\nthe Frankel-Romer approach to cross-country data from various periods in the 20th century to show\nthat  this  trade\u2013income  relationship  is  indeed  highly  robust.\n\nBuilding on two literatures, namely the one on institutions and incomes and the other on\ntrade  and  incomes,  Rodrik,  Subramanian,  and  Trebbi  (2002)  looked  at  the  simultaneous  effects\nof institutions, geography, and trade on per capita income levels.  They used a measure of property\nrights  and  the  rule  of  law  to  capture  institutions  and  the  trade\u2013GDP  ratio  to  capture  openness\nin trade, treating both as endogenous in their growth regressions. They used the instruments of\nAcemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001) and Frankel and Romer (1999) to instrument institutions\nand  trade  openness,  respectively,  and  separately.    Rodrik,  Subramanian  and  Trebbi  (2002)  find\nthat \u201cthe quality of institutions trumps everything else.\u201d However, trade and institutions have positive\neffects on each other, so that the former affects incomes through the latter. Similarly, geography\nalso  affects  institutions.\n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 82\n\n9\n\n\fINSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES FOR GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION:\nTHE ROLE OF PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT\nRANA HASAN, DEVASHISH MITRA, AND MEHMET ULUBASOGLU\n\nB.\n\nInstitutions, Policies, and Poverty\n\nMoving  from  growth  rates  and  incomes  to  poverty,  we  find  that  the  literature  on  the\ndeterminants of poverty rates and changes (or reductions) in it is much smaller. Dollar and Kraay\n(2002), in a cross-country study of 92 countries over the last four decades, find that the growth\nrates of average incomes of people in the bottom quintile are no different from the growth rates\nof overall per capita incomes, with the former growth always positively associated with the latter.\nThus the share of the bottom quintile of the population in overall income is fairly stable. Likewise,\npolicies that promote overall growth advance growth in the incomes of the poor.  These policies\ninclude trade openness, macroeconomic stability, moderate government size, financial development,\nand  strong  property  rights  and  the  rule  of  law.\n\nOne difficulty with interpreting the results of Dollar and Kraay is in their measure of poverty\nbeing a relative one.  Due to their focus on incomes of the bottom quintile, it can be argued that\ntheir paper is more directly connected to the issue of inequality rather than absolute poverty per\nse. As a number of analysts have argued, insofar as developing countries are concerned, it is not\nso much relative poverty but absolute poverty that needs to be the focus of attention. Cross-country\nstudies  on  absolute  poverty  are  to  our  knowledge  very  limited.  Ravallion  (2001)  studies  the\nrelationship between $1-a-day poverty rates and economic growth. He finds that an increase in\nper  capita  income  by  1%  can  reduce  the  proportion  of  people  below  the  $1-a-day  poverty  line\nby about 2.5% on average. This \u201cpoverty elasticity\u201d varies across countries, depending on initial\ninequality. In other words, how close the poor are to the poverty line matters. Ravallion, however,\ndoes not examine the links between (absolute) poverty and policies. A recent paper that does so\nis that of Hasan, Quibria, and Kim (2003). A key finding of this paper is that measures of economic\nfreedom are found to be closely linked to reductions in poverty.3 A measure of political freedom,\non the other hand, is not. Economic freedom indicators used by these authors include government\nsize, price stability, freedom to trade with foreigners, and measures of political and civil liberties.\n\nMoving to country-specific empirical work, a notable study is that of Ravallion and Datt (1999)\non  the  determinants  of  poverty  reduction  across  India\u2019s  major  states  between  1960  and  1994.\nThe study shows empirically how initial conditions\u2014and thus initial inequalities\u2014matter. Similar\nto  the  findings  from  cross-country  comparisons  of  poverty\u2013growth  linkages,  Ravallion  and  Datt\nfind  that  the  impact  of  a  given  amount  of  growth  in  nonfarm  output  on  poverty  reduction  can\nvary considerably across India\u2019s states.  For example, a 1% increase in nonagricultural state domestic\nproduct leads to a 1.2% decline in poverty rates in the states of Kerala and West Bengal versus\nonly  0.3%  decline  in  Bihar.  The fact  that  growth  of  nonfarm  output  was  also  relatively  meager\nin  Bihar  over  the  period  under  consideration  exacerbated  the  poverty  problem  in  Bihar.4\n\n3 It may be noted that this paper derives estimates of absolute poverty by combining data on the distribution of per\ncapita income (expenditure) with national account data on income (private consumption expenditure). Such an approach\nhas  been  used  by  Bhalla  (2002)  and  Sala-I-Martin  (2002).\n\n4 Ravallion and Datt then explore which factors \u201cexplain\u201d this differential impact of nonfarm sector growth on poverty\nby state. Differences in initial conditions relating to rural development and human resources are found to be a key\nsource of the interstate differential in poverty impacts of nonfarm output. The role played by initial literacy appears\nespecially large. In particular, Ravallion and Datt find that more than half of the differential impact of nonfarm output\non poverty rates is attributable to Kerala\u2019s much higher levels of initial literacy. Their results suggest that while the\n\n10\n\nJULY 2006\n\n\fSECTION IV\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nIV. METHODOLOGY\n\nIn  this  paper,  we  look  at  the  determinants  of  growth  and  poverty  focusing  attention  on\ninstitutions and policies, especially those relating to regulation of the private sector. Our variables\non the right-hand side fall into two broad categories, namely institutional indicators and policy\nvariables.  Thus,  our  estimating  equation  for  growth  is  the  following:\n\ngi = \u03b10 + \u03b11(cid:127) yi + \u03b12(cid:127) INVi + \u03b2 (cid:127) Insti  + \u03b3 (cid:127) Policyi + \u03b5i\n\n(1)\n\nwhere  gi stands for the average growth rate of per capita income during a decade (1990\u20131999),\nyi stands for the logarithm of initial per capita income (at the beginning of the decade), INVi stands\nfor  the  average  investment  rate  (investment  as  a  fraction  of  overall  GDP)  for  that  decade,  Insti\nis the decade average vector of institutional variables and Policyi the vector of policy variables.5\nOur  estimating  equation  for  poverty  is  the  following:\n\nPi = b0 + b1 yi + B  (cid:127) Insti + C  (cid:127) Policyi + vi\n\n(2)\n\nwhere  Pi  stands  for  the  poverty  rate,  given  by  the  under-$2-a-day  headcount  ratio  in  1999  and\nthe  other  variables  are  as  defined  earlier.\n\nThe  institutional  variables  include  a  measure  of  governance\u2014the  principle-component\naggregate of measures of the rule of law, government efficiency, and corruption.  These also include\nthe \u201cmeta-institution\u201d of democracy as captured by an index of political freedom.  Why do we include\na  measure  of  political  freedom?  There  is  a  strong  presumption  that  the  lack  of  property  rights,\nhigh regulatory burden, and high levels of corruption, etc., result in high levels of rent-seeking\nactivity and the exploitation of the rest of the society by the elite through the exercise of \u201cpublic\npower  for  private  benefit\u201d.  Thus  the  poor  could  end  up  getting  a  very  small  share  of  an  already\nsmall pie. In a democracy, however, it can be dangerous to keep a significant proportion of the\npopulation deprived and angry. Alternatively, political freedom could lead to populist policies that\ncould end up reducing economic growth. We therefore look at the impact of political freedom and\ngovernance  on  the  incidence  of  poverty.\n\nSome have argued that institutions are endogenous to growth. However, in the new literature\n(Hall  and  Jones  1999;  Rodrik,  Subramanian,  and  Trebbi  2004)  as  explained  in  Section  III,  it  is\n\ntransition from (low-wage) agriculture to (higher wage) nonfarm sectors may be key for the removal of poverty, making\nthe transition is not easy or automatic for the poor. In other words, there are costs to be incurred on the part of\na poor agricultural worker to making the transition. These costs are not only pecuniary ones but also nonpecuniary\nassociated with investments in minimum levels of education, nutrition, and health so as to be able to work productively\nin  the  nonfarm  sector.\n\n5 The institutional and policy variables can affect the rate of growth through investment and other channels. Therefore,\nwe run the above regression with and without INV as a regressor. This helps us somewhat in identifying the investment\nand noninvestment channels.\n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 82\n\n11\n\n\fINSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES FOR GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION:\nTHE ROLE OF PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT\nRANA HASAN, DEVASHISH MITRA, AND MEHMET ULUBASOGLU\n\nthe income level and not the growth rate that depends on institutions, which in turn also depend\non the income level itself. If we believe that institutions are slow to adjust, then using initial per\ncapita  income  as  a  control  should  take  care  of  the  bulk  of  the  endogeneity  problem.\n\nThe policy variables capture key regulations governing the operations of the private sector.\nThese include measures relating to the ease of starting a business, closing a business, and labor\nmarket  policies  that  businesses  must  abide  by.  Our  policy  variables  also  include  measures  of\ngovernment size and trade openness. We know that the public sector provides basic infrastructure\nand social services, and that, at one level, it can have strong complementarities with the private\nsector. However, too big a government can lead to inefficiency especially if it tries to operate in\nspheres  that  are  normally  meant for  the  private  sector.  Also,  big  governments  can  be  captured\nby the elite and can promote rent seeking at the cost of real production. Trade, on the other hand,\ncan  generate  efficiency  through  gains  from  specialization  and  exchange,  as  well  as  through  the\navailability  of  larger  varieties  of  final  and  intermediate  goods.  Thus,  it  can  result  in  enhanced\nreal  incomes.  While  the  theoretical  foundations  for  enhanced  real  income  levels  through  trade\nare strong, the growth effects are less clear cut. There is a vast and rich theoretical literature on\ntrade  and  growth,  but  the  results  span  the  entire  spectrum  depending  on  the  specifics  of  the\nassumptions made. Therefore, this is an empirical question that has received considerable attention\nrecently  but  for  which  no  conclusive  answers  have  been  provided  so  far.\n\nFurther, the size of the public sector and trade openness should also have an impact on poverty.\nAs explained above, the size of the public sector should affect income and growth and thus, for\na  given  distribution  of income,  have  an  impact  on  poverty.  Additionally,  the  size  of  the  public\nsector can also have an impact on the distribution of income. If the government believes in making\nsociety more egalitarian, it will use its machinery to provide social services for the relatively poorer\nsections of the society. On the other hand, the government can just be an instrument of the elite,\nwhich means that an increase in government size will worsen the distribution of income. We therefore\nempirically explore the relationship between poverty and the share of the government in overall\nGDP.\n\nInternational trade can have an impact on poverty through its effects on the overall level\nof real income, the distribution of income, the sectoral composition of the economy, the relative\nrewards to different factors of production and the extent of urbanization. Again, trade affects poverty\nthrough both growth and distribution. As Bhagwati (2004, 53), focusing on the growth channel\nwrites, \u201cThe scientific analysis of the effect of trade on poverty \u2026 has centered on a two-step\nargument: that trade enhances growth, and that growth reduces poverty.\u201d Furthermore, Winters,\nMcCulloch, and McKay (2004) argue that \u201calthough growth can be unequalizing, it has to be strongly\nso if it is to increase absolute poverty. This appears to be not the case either in general or for\ngrowth  associated  with  freer  trade.\u201d  They  argue  that  it  is,  in  fact,  the  openness-growth  link  on\nwhich  economists  differ.\n\nOther channels, according to Winters, McCulloch, and McKay through which trade can affect\npoverty are through its effects on overall economic stability, the creation and destruction of markets,\noutput prices, wages, and employment. Also, how trade will affect wages of the poor will depend\non the nature of factor endowments and comparative advantage. An important factor here is the\nextent of transitional unemployment caused by trade liberalization that gets concentrated on the\npoor.  Finally,  trade  liberalization  also  does  have  an  impact  on  the  poor  through  its  effects  on\ngovernment  revenue.\n\n12\n\nJULY 2006\n\n\fSECTION V\nDATA\n\nV. DATA\n\nOur complete data set covers over a hundred countries, each with one data point (a decadal\naverage unless otherwise stated) for each variable over the period 1990\u20131999. Fifteen countries\nare from developing Asia. Our data set covers a number of variables obtained from various sources.\nGrowth is the average of annual percentage changes in real GDP per capita (base year 1995) within\na decade.  Initial income is the log real per capita income of 1990. INV is the share of investment\n(gross  capital  formation)  in  GDP;  PUB  is  the  share  of  general  government  final  consumption\nexpenditure in GDP; and trade/GDP is the sum of exports and imports of goods and services measured\nas a share of gross domestic product. We obtained these data from World Development Indicators\n(World  Bank  2003).\n\nPoverty is measured as the proportion of the population living on less than \u201c$2-a-day\u201d and\nis  primarily  obtained  from  the  PovcalNet  database  of  the  World  Bank  (World  Bank  2004b).6 For\na few countries from developing Asia, however, we replaced the poverty estimates from PovcalNet\nwith estimates from Key Indicators (ADB 2004). These countries are Cambodia, Lao PDR, Malaysia,\nNepal, Pakistan, and Viet Nam.7 While Chen and Ravallion (2004) describe the  PovcalNet data in\ndetail, the following points are useful to keep in mind. First, the PovcalNet database presents two\ntypes of poverty esitmates:  \u201cactual\u201d and \u201csynthetic.\u201d The former pertain to years in which nationally\nrepresentative household income and/or expenditure surveys were carried out. The latter pertain\nto poverty estimates derived for common \u201creference\u201d years.8   We use poverty estimates from 1990\nand 1999 reference years for the 76 developing countries that overlap across our sample and the\nPovcalNet database.  While many of these reference-year estimates may be \u201csynthetic\u201d ones, including\nthese in the analysis allows us to carry out a much richer analysis than would otherwise have been\npossible. Second, our choice of using the $2-a-day poverty line, as opposed to the $1-a-day poverty\nline popularly used in the international media, is due to the fact that it conforms better with poverty\nlines  more  typical  in  low-middle-income  countries  as  opposed  to  low-income  countries  only.\nAdditionally, using the $2-a-day poverty line enables us to increase our sample size in a meaningful\nway.  This  is  because  while  $1-a-day  poverty  estimates  exist  for  many  middle-income  countries,\nthese estimates can be extremely low (close to 0) thereby reducing the variation in poverty rates\nin  the  way  that  could  bias  econometric  results.\n\nPolitical freedom is the simple average of the countries\u2019 political rights and civil liberties scores\nas given in the Freedom House (2003) report. The correlation between political rights and civil\nliberties is very high, so taking their simple average is expected to measure the overall political\nfreedom  in  the  countries.\n\nWe have also utilized a set of institutional variables capturing the state of \u201cgovernance\u201d obtained\nfrom Kaufman et al. (1999). These are measures of Rule of Law, Government Efficiency, and Control\nof  Corruption.  While  we  used  these  variables  individually  in  the  regressions,  we  also  exercised\n\n6 The term $2-a-day is used for convenience. The actual figure is $2.15 in 1993 PPP exchange rates for the consumption\n\naggregate.\n\n7 See  ADB  (2004)  for  more  details.\n8 Since most countries typically carry out the relevant household surveys every 3-5 years, it will be common to find\nthat a survey is not carried out in one of the reference years. In all such cases, poverty estimates are obtained for\nreference  years  using  the  extrapolation  methods  of  Chen  and  Ravallion  (2004).\n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 82\n\n13\n\n\fINSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES FOR GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION:\nTHE ROLE OF PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT\nRANA HASAN, DEVASHISH MITRA, AND MEHMET ULUBASOGLU\n\nwith their principal components aggregation, and we report the results with this variable. Additionally,\nbecause  these  data  are  available  from  1996  onward,  we  used  the  1996  values  only,  and  in  that\nway  we  limited  the  scope  for  reverse  causation.\n\nWe  also  used  a  set  of  Doing  Business  variables  obtained  from  World  Bank  (2004a).  While\nthere are five broad categories (entry regulations, labor regulations, contract enforcement, getting\ncredit,  and  closing  business)  to  measure  business  regulations,  with  several  criteria  within  each\ncategory, we used some single measures. These are for the categories of entry regulations, closing\nbusiness categories, and labor regulations, to capture the business environment, believing that\nthe other categories are generally covered by our other governance variables. The original sources\nfor these data are Djankov et al. (2002) and Djankov et al. (2003), respectively, for entry/starting\na  business,  closing  a  business,  and  labor  market  regulations.  In  particular,  for  entry  regulations\nwe used the number of procedures for starting a business, cost of starting a business (as a percent\nof income per capita), and time/duration taken for starting a business (in days). As in the case\nof Kaufman et al. variables, we exercised with these single indicators as well as with their principal\ncomponents  aggregation.  Regarding  closing  a  business,  we  used  the  cost  of  closing  a  business\n(as a percent of the value of the estate) and time required for closing a business (in years), as\nboth single and aggregated indicators. For labor market regulations, we worked with indexes of\nregulatory difficulties associated with hiring workers and firing workers (the values of both indexes\nranging from 0 to 100), and the costs of firing workers (in terms of weekly wages).9   Lastly,  we\naggregated these various Doing Business indicators using principal components to obtain aggregated\nDoing Business variables, and the results are also reported with these variables. The Doing Business\nvariables\u2014whether in aggregated form or in terms of their individual values\u2014are again treated\nas  belonging  to  the  1990s.\n\nVI.

While Table\n1 presents mean values by region for all but the Doing Business variables, Tables 2 and 3 present\ncountry-specific values for all variables pertinent to this paper\u2019s analysis including the Doing Business\nvariables for not only ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs) but also various other countries,\ndeveloping  and  developed,  to  serve  as  points  of  comparison.\n\n9 The difficulty of hiring index measures whether term contracts can only be used for temporary tasks; the maximum\nduration of term contracts; and the ratio of the mandated minimum wage to the average value added per working\npopulation.  The difficulty of firing index is composed of various components that include whether regulations allow\ndismissal  on  the  basis  of  worker  redundancy,  whether  the  firing  of  redundant  workers  require  notification  of  labor\nunion  or  labor  ministry,  whether  their  approval  is  required,  etc.  The  cost  of  firing  indicator  measures  the  cost  of\nadvance notice requirements, severance payments, and penalties that may arise when firing a worker.  All of these\ncosts  are  totaled  and  expressed  in  terms  of  weekly  wages.  See  World  Bank  (2004a).\n\n14\n\nJULY 2006\n\n\fSECTION VI\nRESULTS\n\nConsider first the region-specific averages presented in Table 1. The DMCs are grouped into\n\nthree  categories:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\nDMC  South  Asia  comprising  Bangladesh,  India,  Nepal,  and  Pakistan\n\nDMC East and Southeast Asia (ESA) 3 comprising Republic of Korea; Singapore; and\nTaipei,China\n\nDMC East and Southeast Asia (ESA) 7 comprising Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China,\nIndonesia,  Malaysia,  Philippines,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam\n\nThe first three columns of Table 1 reveal that as of 1990 the highest poverty rates existed\nin South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and DMC ESA 7.  As for changes in poverty, the largest declines\ntook place in DMC ESA 7.  South Asia also saw reasonable declines in poverty; however, this record\nis rendered a bit suspect due to the case of Pakistan for which national estimates of poverty reveal\npoverty to have increased slightly over the 1990s (see ADB 2004 for more details).  In contrast,\ndeclines  in  poverty  were  on  average  meager  for  sub-Saharan  Africa.\n\nThe experiences with poverty reduction follow closely the experiences with economic growth.\nThus, the large declines in poverty experienced by ESA 7 have been accompanied by high growth\nper  capita  incomes-on  average  4%  per  annum.  Similarly,  sub-Saharan  Africa\u2019s  meager  reduction\nin poverty has been accompanied by a slight contraction of its economy over the 1990s.  A clear\noutlier in this general pattern is the Middle East and North Africa region.  In this region, despite\npositive though low economic growth, we find that poverty rates increased by 5 percentage points\nover  the  1990s.\n\nHigh growth in the ESA region has itself been accompanied by a high share of investment\nin  GDP,  low  shares  of  government  consumption  expenditures  in  GDP,  and  a  high  degree  of\ninternational integration whether measured in terms of trade shares or in terms of the SW-WH index\nof openness. By comparison, investment rates have been significantly lower in South Asia and the\ndegree of international integration has been quite a bit less.  Indeed, South Asia is less integrated\nthan any other developing region in the world including sub-Saharan Africa. However, the share\nof  government  expenditures  has  been  comparable  to  that  of  ESA.\n\nSouth Asia also shows up performing poorly on our measure of governance (where lower values\nreflect worse governance). Only sub-Saharan Africa comes up with a poorer level of governance.\nOn  political  freedom,  however,  South  Asia  does  not  perform  too  badly.  In  terms  of  the  index  of\npolitical freedom, whereby lower values reflect more political freedom, South Asia is found to have\non average greater political freedom than ESA 7, sub-Saharan Africa, and Middle East and North\nAfrica.\n\nIn summary, region-specific averages indicate that among developing regions where poverty\nis still a significant problem, ESA 7 has done the best job in reducing poverty. It has had the highest\nrates of economic growth, the highest rates of investment, and been quite open to trade.  In terms\nof governance, however, its performance has been average while on political freedom it ranks low.\nAt the same time, it should not be forgotten that poverty rates in ESA continued to be far higher\nthan in three other major developing regions: Latin America, Middle East and North Africa, and\nEastern  Europe.\n\nSince region-specific averages can mask important differences across countries we now turn\nto an examination of country-specific values taken by the variables of interest in this paper including\n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 82\n\n15\n\n\fINSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES

An examination of changes in poverty by country, shown\nin column 3 of Table 2, reveals, for example, that while Latin America\u2019s performance in reducing\npoverty  may  have  been  lackluster  on  average  over  the  1990s,  some  individual  Latin  American\ncountries  did  quite  well  in  reducing  poverty.  For  example,  Mexico  reduced  poverty  rates  by  20\npercentage points over the 1990s.  This performance is comparable to the poverty reduction record\nof Vietnam and PRC. In contrast, the examination of changes in poverty in major African countries\nreveals that their performance has been much worse than that of the average country in that region.\nSimilarly, it can be seen that ESA 7\u2019s high investment shares are driven mainly by the extraordinarily\nhigh values registered by PRC, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. On the other, hand, Philippines,\nViet Nam, and especially Cambodia are marked by investment shares that are much lower than the\naverage for this region. On governance, although South Asia registers a weak score, disaggregating\nthe numbers by country, we see that the weak score is driven to a large degree by the very low\nscores  for  Bangladesh  and  Pakistan.\n\nWe now turn to the Doing Business measures of business regulation. What is interesting to\nnote is the wide variance in the values taken by the various business regulation variables across\nthe countries. Singapore is found to have the least cumbersome regulations governing entry and\nexit of businesses and labor issues in Asia. Singapore\u2019s regulations even compare favorably with\nthe most developed countries in the world. By contrast, starting a business in Cambodia, India,\nand Indonesia is found to entail far more time; the relative costs for starting to business are also\nfar higher, especially in Cambodia and Indonesia.  Similarly, while it takes less than a year to close\na  business  in  Singapore  it  takes  as  long  as  10  years  to  do  so  in  India!  This  can  represent  a\nconsiderable  wastage  of  capital\u2014both  physical  as  well  as  entrepreneurial\u2014as  the  capital  waits\nto get redeployed from a failing business to an alternative one. Next, while three countries in the\nregion have few restrictions on the hiring of workers (for example, they do not disallow the usage\nof fixed term contracts for particular types of tasks) a number of other countries in the region,\nincluding Indonesia; Pakistan; Taipei,China; and Thailand put considerable restrictions on the types\nof contracts that can be used to hire workers.  Interestingly, virtually every country, with the notable\nexception of Singapore from developing Asia, puts in place restrictions on firing workers. These\nrestrictions  are  especially  severe  in  India  and  Nepal  followed  by  Indonesia,  Sri  Lanka,  and  Viet\nNam.    Finally,  while  firing  workers  entails  a  cost  of four  weeks  of  wages for  firms  in  Singapore,\nthis can be as high as 157 weeks in the case of Indonesia and 108 weeks in the case of Sri Lanka.\n\nIn what follows, we implement growth and poverty regressions involving the various variables\nwe have discussed above including business regulation variables provided in the Doing Business\ndatabase.  In this way we are able to determine whether and how these variables are related to\neconomic  growth  and  poverty.\n\nB.\n\nGrowth  Regressions\n\nTables 4a\u20137 present the results of our growth regressions. Tables 4a-6b come in two versions.\nIn  Tables  4a,  5a,  and  6a  the  Doing  Business  variables  enter  the  regression  equation  expressed\nas principal components. In contrast, in Tables 4b, 5b, and 6b they appear in terms of the actual\nvalues taken by the individual regulatory measures, for example, as numbers of procedures, duration\nor  time,  and  costs  of  starting  a  business,  etc.  While  Tables  4a  and  4b  only  introduce  measures\n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 82\n\n19\n\n\fINSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES FOR GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION:\nTHE ROLE OF PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT\nRANA HASAN, DEVASHISH MITRA, AND MEHMET ULUBASOGLU\n\nof governance, political freedom, and the Doing Business measures as explanatory variables, Tables\n5a\u20136b also introduce measures of openness and the size of public sector as elements of the overall,\neconomywide  policy  setup.  Initial  income  is  included  in  every  regression  equation  we  run.10\n\nConsider first the effect of governance on growth. As noted earlier, the variable governance\nis the principal component aggregation of the rule of law, government efficiency, and corruption\nvariables of Kaufman et al. As is clearly seen in all tables, regardless of the controls used, governance\nis strongly significant at the 1% level with a robust positive sign. What is its quantitative impact\non  growth?    Consider  the  first  column  of  Table  4a  where the  coefficient  of  governance  is  1.37.\nThis implies that, holding all else constant, an improvement in governance from the value registered\nby Cambodia (the lowest in Asia) to the value registered by Singapore (not only the best in Asia\nbut the best in the world) would lead to a 7.5 percentage point increase in the growth rate. This\nis  clearly  a  dramatic  effect.  On  the  other  hand,  political  freedom  is  mostly  insignificant  across\nspecifications.  In  the  few  instances  in  which  political  freedom  enters  significantly,  it  shows  up\nwith a positive sign. Since larger values of political freedom imply a more authoritarian regime,\nthis suggests that controlling for initial income, governance, and other variables, greater political\nfreedom has been weakly associated with lower economic growth. This would be consistent with\nrecent work that has stressed the importance of good governance as distinct from political freedom\nbeing  critical  for  driving  economic  growth  (Glaeser  et  al.  2004).\n\nAs noted earlier, we introduced the Doing Business variables into the growth regressions in\nterms  of  two  broad  approaches.  One  approach  aggregates  individual  variables  in  various\ncombinations using principal component analysis. First, we aggregate the individual measures of\nbusiness regulation relating to starting and closing a business and labor issues with the principal\ncomponent method using the various individual measures in different combinations. Higher values\nof the principal component variables reflect more cumbersome regulations. Tables 4a, 5a, and 6a\ndescribed these results. \u201cDoing Business \u2013 1\u201d is the principal component aggregation of the number\nof procedures, costs, and the time for starting a business; and the costs and the time required\nfor closing a business.  The most notable result is that this \u201csuper-aggregated\u201d variable is estimated\nwith a negative and significant (at 10%) coefficient when governance is not in the regression;\nbut in the presence of governance the coefficient becomes insignificant. Exactly the same result\nholds  for  \u201cDoing  Business  \u2013  2\u201d,  which  also  includes  in  the  principal  component  aggregation  of\n\u201cDoing  Business  \u2013  1\u201d,  indexes  of  difficulties  in  hiring  and  firing  workers  and  a  measure  of  the\nmonetary  costs  of  firing  workers.\n\nA less aggregated approach is also used for constructing principal component variables. \u201cStart\u201d\nis the principal component aggregation of the number of procedures, costs, and the time needed\nfor starting a business; \u201cclose\u201d is the principal component  aggregation of the costs and the time\nrequired  for  closing  a  business;  and  \u201clabor\u201d  is  the  principal  component  aggregation  of  indexes\nof difficulties in hiring and firing workers and the costs associated with firing workers. We employ\nthese  variables  both  separately  and  jointly  in  the  regressions.  All  of  them  are  estimated  to  be\ninsignificant in the regressions, except one case of \u201cclose\u201d where it is employed individually and\n\n10 From  all  these  tables,  we  see  that  there  is  some  evidence  of  conditional  convergence,  depending  on  the  controls\nused. In other words, in some cases the logarithm of the initial per capita income has a negative sign and is significant.\nThe evidence is not so strong as our sample consists of only the time period 1990\u20131999 (due to the institutional\ndata availability). The Asian financial crisis took place toward the end of this period and may have interfered with\nconvergence  effects  among  countries.\n\n20\n\nJULY 2006\n\n\fSECTION VI\nRESULTS\n\nTABLE  4A\nPER CAPITA INCOME GROWTH: INSTITUTIONS AND BUSINESS REGULATIONS I\n\nPER CAPITA INCOME GROWTH\n\nInitial  Income\n\n-1.073\n(4.06)***\n\n0.080\n(0.49)\n\n0.009\n(0.07)\n\n-0.008\n(0.06)\n\n0.067\n(0.48)\n\n0.100\n(0.82)\n\n0.126\n(1.05)\n\n0.008\n(0.05)\n\nGovernance\n\n1.371\n(5.27)***\n\nPolitical Freedom\n\nDoing  Business  \u2013  1\n\nDoing  Business  \u2013  2\n\nStart\n\nClose\n\nLabor\n\n-0.224\n(1.07)\n\n-0.318\n(1.86)*\n\n-0.300\n(1.71)*\n\n-0.289\n(1.39)\n\nConstant\n\n9.613\n(4.70)***\n\n1.259\n(0.71)\n\nObservations\n\n116\n\nAdjusted  R-squared\n\n0.24\n\n131\n\n0.02\n\n1.103\n(0.97)\n\n112\n\n0.02\n\n1.239\n(1.08)\n\n0.626\n(0.56)\n\n112\n\n0.03\n\n115\n\n0.02\n\nNote:  Robust  t  statistics  in  parentheses.\n* significant at 10%;

In other words, regulations that\nmake  it  more  difficult  to  close  a  business  are  associated  with  lower  growth.\n\nA second approach to introducing the Doing Business variables is to use the actual values\ntaken by the various measures of regulation. It is useful to recall that as the values of these variables\nrise, regulations become more cumbersome. The key findings are as follows. Most notably, starting\ncost  is  robustly  significant  at  the  1%  level  with  a  negative  sign,  both  with  and  without  the\ngovernance  and  the  political  freedom  variables  in  the  regressions.  The  coefficient  is  estimated\nconsistently to be around \u20130.005. This implies that holding all else constant, a decline in starting\ncosts  from  the  levels  recorded  for  Cambodia  (by  far  the  highest  in  Asia)  to  those  recorded  for\nthe United States (among the lowest in the world) would lead to a 2.4 percentage point increase\nin growth rates. Starting procedures, however, has unxpectedly a positive and significant (at 10%)\nsign in one case (Table 4b) so that an increase in starting procedures is associated with an increase\nin growth rates.  However, the impact of this variable is not very robust. When government expenditure\nand openness are controlled for (as in Tables 5b and 6b), the impact of starting procedures turns\nto be insignificant. Starting time is in all cases estimated as insignificant.\n\nClosing time and closing costs are estimated insignificant in all cases as well. However, firing\ncosts have the same result as starting procedures: a positive and significant (at 10%) sign in one\ncase  (Table  4b)  so  that  the  higher  the  firing  costs,  the  higher  the  growth.  But  again,  when\ngovernment  expenditure  and  trade  policy  are  controlled  for,  this  sign  turns  to  be  insignificant\n(as  in  Tables  5b  and  6b).\n\nCumbersome labor hiring regulations have a negative and significant impact (at the 5% level)\non  growth  in  the  absence  of  the  governance  and  political  freedom  variables  as  controls.11  The\ncoefficient on labor hiring implies that, holding all else constant, moving from the level of difficulties\nin hiring regulations seen in Pakistan (the most difficult in Asia) to those in Singapore or Sri Lanka\n(the  least  difficult)  would  lead  to  an  increase  in  growth  of  about  1.25\u20131.4  percentage  points.\nInterestingly, difficulties in firing labor always appear with a negative sign, implying that the greater\nregulatory barriers to firing workers are associated with lower economic growth.  However, the effect\nis typically found to have an insignificant impact on growth, the exception being when governance,\npolitical  freedom,  and  investment  variables  are  jointly  controlled  for  in  the  regression.  In  this\ncase regulatory restrictions on firing workers have a negative and significant coefficient at 10%.\n\nThe results with the Doing Business variables imply that there is some evidence that private\nsector regulations have an impact on growth.  But the results also suggest that it is not individual\ncomponents of the set of regulations but the overall package that is more important.  In other\nwords,  there  could  be  several  alternative  combinations  of  various  regulations  that  might  result\nin a given growth rate, and this results in the significance of the overall index and not the individual\ncomponents. Also, it is only through better governance that better packages of regulations can\nbe  delivered,  and therefore  controlling for  the  former  takes  away  the  effect  of  the  latter.\n\nFrom our regressions, we cannot really say that openness as measured by the share of trade\nin GDP has any systematic effect on the growth rate of an economy. In most of the regressions,\nthis variable is insignificant. The impact of openness, however, is often positive when we use the\n\n11 This  suggests  that  the  influence  of  labor  hiring  on  growth  works  through  these  variables.\n\n28\n\nJULY 2006\n\n\fSECTION VI\nRESULTS\n\nSachs-Warner  index  of  openness  updated  by  Wacziarg  and  Welch  (SWWH).  When  this  index  is\nsignificant, the coefficient is estimated to be between 1.5\u20131.7. This implies that completely open\nregimes\u2014such as that of Singapore (SWWH index = 1)\u2014have, on average, growth rates that are\n1.5\u20131.7 percentage points higher than those of closed regimes such as that of India  (SWWH index\n=  0).  However,  very  interestingly,  the  significance  of  SWWH  is  conditional  upon  the  absence  of\nthe  governance  variable  in  the  regression.  There  are  two  possible  reasons  for  this  conditional\nsignificance of the SWWH dummy. Firstly, the opening of the trade regime, as shown by the SWWH\ndummy,  captures  more  than  trade  liberalization;  it  involves  a  higher  scale  policy  reform  and\ninstitutional changes.12 Secondly, the governance variable itself could capture trade policy if good\ntrade policy itself is an integral part of good governance. A possible implication of this conditional\nsignificance of the trade policy variable is that all well-governed economies are open to trade but\nnot all open economies are well governed; and that openness, in the absence of good governance,\nis  irrelevant  for  economic  growth.\n\nLastly,  we  consider  the  size  of  public  sector,  as  measured  by  the  share  of  government\nexpenditure in GDP, and trade policy variables. In almost all our growth regressions, government\nexpenditure is negative and significant. This means that the larger the size of the public sector\nrelative  to  the  overall  economy,  the  lower  is  the  growth  rate.  While  the  public  sector  provides\ninfrastructure essential to the proper functioning of the private sector, an increase in its size could\nalso portend a reduction in the more dynamic component of the economy, namely the private sector.\nAlso,  the  public  sector  may  breed  corruption  and  inefficiency,  and  increase  the  incentives  for\nunproductive  activities  such  as  lobbying.  We  see  from  our  regressions  that  a  percentage  point\nincrease in the share of the public sector is generally associated with a 0.1\u20130.15 percentage point\nreduction  in  the  growth  rate.\n\nAs  one  can  see,  our  regressions,  except  the  ones  presented  in  Table  7,  do  not  include  INV\n(investment as a share of GDP) as a right-hand side variable. The reason is that our institutional,\npolicy, and governance variables may affect growth through their effect on investment as well as\nindependently of it. In the former case, we would like to allow the parameter estimates of the policy\nand institutional variables to capture their full role in the determination of growth through all\npossible mechanisms. But as we clearly see in Table 7, there is no drastic change in the impact\nof  policy  and  institutional  variable  on  growth  when  INV  is  controlled  for  in  the  regressions  as\ncompared  to  the  results  reported  in  Table  6b.  The  results  for  government  expenditure,  SWWH,\ngovernance, and starting costs are qualitatively the same.  There are only three changes over previous\nresults.  First, although countries that lack political freedom continue to tend toward having higher\ngrowth rates, this effect is not statistically significant in any specification. Similarly, restrictions\non hiring workers now do not show up with a significant negative impact on growth.  Both suggest\nthat the impact of these variables on growth work through their (positive) effect on investment\nrates.  Interestingly, however, there is some evidence now that restrictions on labor firing can have\na negative and significant impact on growth (last column). The coefficient of \u20130.014 implies that\nholding all else constant, moving from a regime such as that of India (difficulty of firing worker\nindex  =  90)  to  that  of  Singapore  (index  equal  0)  would  add  1.26  percentage  points  to  growth\nrates.\n\n12 Rodriguez and Rodrik (2001) note that the SW dummy is a better measure of institutional change than being a trade\n\npolicy indicator.\n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 82\n\n29\n\n\fINSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES FOR GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION:\nTHE ROLE OF PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT\nRANA HASAN, DEVASHISH MITRA, AND MEHMET ULUBASOGLU\n\nAs for the impact of investment on growth, as can be seen from examining Table 7, investment\nhas a positive and robust effect on growth. This is consistent with the old Harrod-Domar type as\nwell  as  Mahalanobis  type  growth  models.  It  is  also  consistent  with  the  prediction  of  recent\nendogenous growth theories. Additionally, Easterly and Levine (1997) find that among nearly 50\nvariables considered in growth regressions, the most robust effect is that of investment. A high\nrate  of  investment  helps  build  up  the  economy\u2019s  future  capacity  to  produce,  and  hence  results\nin higher growth. We see from our regressions reported in Table 7 that a 15 percentage point increase\nin the investment rate\u2014the difference in investment rates across the PRC and India\u2014can bring\nabout  a  1.2\u20132.1  percentage  point  increase  in  the  growth  rate  depending  on  the  particular\nspecification  employed.\n\n In sum, a lot of the cross-country differences in growth can be explained by differences in\ngovernance quality, investment, and size of the public sector. Since good governance should lead\nto good policies, and we do not see good (bad) policies when the quality of governance is poor\n(good),  policies  do  not  exhibit  an  independent  impact  on  growth.  Additionally,  policies  will  be\neffective for growth as long as the institutional framework allows them to do so. However, investment\nand public sector size do seem to matter for growth independently of institutions, as they may\nnot  entirely  be  a  function  of  the  nature,  quality,  and  style  of  governance.    While  savings,  and\ntherefore investment rates, also depend on rates of time preference and intergenerational altruism\nof households, the size of the public sector depends on the government\u2019s inequality aversion and\nits concern for unemployment reduction. In other words, it is possible to have good governments\nboth to the left and right of center, and they may resolve the equity\u2013efficiency trade-offs in different\nways.\n\nC.\n\nPoverty Regressions\n\nTables  8  through  10  are  our  poverty  regressions.  Table  8  includes  as  regressors  only  our\ninstitutional  variables  (governance  and  political  freedom)  and  the  Doing  Business  variables\nintroduced  in  terms  of  the  two  approaches  noted  above  (that  is,  in  terms  of  various  principal\ncomponent aggregations as well as values taken up by the individual measures). Table 9 introduces\nthe share of government expenditure as well as trade shares as a measure of openness, while Table\n10 uses the SWWH index as a measure of openness in place of trade shares.  Initial income is included\nin all specifications.13\n\nA notable result and one that is very different from the growth regressions above is that the\npoverty regressions mostly fail to produce significant estimates for the governance variable. However,\nit  should  be  mentioned  that  the  sign  of  the  governance  variable  is  always  negative,  indicating\nthat better governance has been associated with lower poverty levels. Moreover, in the one case\nwhere governance does show up with a statistically significant impact\u2014the case where government\nexpenditure, trade policy as measured by the SWWH index, and closing time and costs are jointly\ncontrolled  for  (Table  10)\u2014the  \u201ceconomic\u201d  impact  of governance  can  be  very  large.  The  size  of\n\n13 As we can see, a higher initial per capita income is negatively correlated with the poverty rate. A 1% increase in\nthe initial per capita income can lead to a reduction in the poverty rate from anywhere between 20 and 23 percentage\npoints.

As for political freedom,\nthis variable is estimated to be insignificant in all cases, a case generally in concurrence with the\ngrowth  regressions.\n\nInterestingly, \u201cDoing Business \u2013 1\u201d is estimated to be significant in all cases at levels varying\nbetween 5\u201310%. The average of the coefficient is 3.4. \u201cDoing Business \u2013 2\u201d, however, is estimated\nas  insignificant  in  all  regressions.  Recall  that  this  variable  includes  \u201cstart\u201d,  \u201cclose\u201d  and  \u201clabor\u201d\nin its aggregation, suggesting that something regarding the labor regulations is working against\nthe Doing Business \u2013 1 variable. This can be confirmed by examining the business regulation variables\non a more disaggregated basis. Indeed, as suggested by column 7 of  Table 8, which reports the\nresults  from  principal  component  aggregations  of  Doing  Business  variables  by  separate  \u201cstart\u201d,\n\u201cclose\u201d and \u201clabor\u201d groupings, the significant impact of Doing Business \u2013 1 on poverty is driven\nby regulations having to do with starting businesses. Regulations associated with closing businesses\nalso matter in the same direction, that is, an increase in regulations is associated with greater\npoverty, albeit not significantly so. However, increased regulations relating to labor are associated\nwith  lower  poverty  (though  not  significantly  so).\n\nTo get  a  better  sense  of  which  specific  types  of regulations  affect  poverty,  we  can  turn  to\nthe  remainder  of  the  results  that  are  based  on  including  the  Doing  Business  variables  in  terms\nof the values taken by individual measures of regulation. Starting costs are estimated to have a\nrobust adverse impact on poverty in all cases, significant at 1% level. The coefficient centers on\n0.055. To get a sense of the quantitative impact of this variable on poverty we can note that a\nreduction in starting costs from the levels registered in Cambodia (by far the highest in Asia and\nperhaps the world) to levels registered in the United States would, holding all else constant, lead\nto a decline in poverty rates of 26.4 percentage points. Taking less extreme values, we can note\nthat a reduction in starting costs from the levels registered in Indonesia to levels registered by\nits Southeast Asian neighbor, Thailand, would lead to a reduction in poverty rates of 6.8 percentage\npoints. Clearly, this is not a trivial decline. In contrast to starting costs, starting procedures and\nstarting  time  are  estimated  to  be  insignificant  in  affecting  poverty.\n\nAs for closing regulations, while the estimate for closing time is always insignificant closing\ncost is estimated to have some impact on poverty, with a positive sign that is significant between\n5-10% levels. Focusing on the statistically significant estimates, a decline in closing costs from\nlevels registered in the Philippines, where among Asian countries they are the highest, to a level\nregistered  by  Pakistan,  among  the  lowest  in  Asia,  would  lead  to  a  decline  of  around  8.8\u20139.9\npercentage  points  in  poverty  rates  holding  all  else  constant.  Lowering  closing  costs  to  levels\nregistered  in  Singapore  would  lead  to  even  lower  poverty  rates.\n\nAmong  labor  regulations  variables,  firing  costs  enter  with  a  negative  sign,  which  in  some\ncases are significant at the 5\u201310% levels. This is interesting, as it implies that an increase in firing\ncosts  decreases  poverty.  Thus,  while  higher  firing  costs  may  be  a  detriment  to  investments,  our\nresults are consistent with the notion that higher firing costs lead firms to either fire workers in\nlesser numbers or that the various payments that firms must make to workers they are firing helps\nthem from falling into poverty. On the other hand, difficulties with hiring and firing regulations\nseem not to have any impact on poverty. Overall, except for the firing costs results, the results\nwith disaggregated Doing Business variables are in line with the results for the growth regressions.\n\n34\n\nJULY 2006\n\n\fSECTION VII\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nThe impact of openness on poverty depends crucially on which measure of openness is used.\nIn striking contrast to the results from the growth regressions, we find that larger trade shares\nare often associated with lower poverty while a higher value of the SWWH index of openness is\nalways insignificantly related to poverty. These results suggest that while a more open trade policy\nmay not lead to significantly lower poverty, countries that have managed to increase trading volumes\nrelative to their GDP have often done so with benefits flowing to the poor. This is not as weak\na result as some may claim. For example, media reports sometimes claim that trade has benefited\ncountries  at  the  expense  of  their  poor.  Our  results  here  do  not  lend  support  to  such  reports.\n\nInterestingly, the particular measure of openness used also has an important bearing on the\nestimated impact of government expenditures on poverty. When trade shares are used as the measure\nof openness, increased government expenditures show up with a positive and significant impact\non  poverty.  In  other  words,  a  larger  public  sector  (as  proxied  by  government  expenditures)  is\nsignificantly  associated  with  higher  poverty.    However,  moving  to  the  SWWH  index  of  openness\ncompletely wipes out the statistical significance on the coefficient of government expenditures.\nThis is understandable, as large government expenditures are a sign of fiscal irresponsibility and\nthe SWWH captures macroeconomic/fiscal reforms that accompany most trade reforms (see Rodriguez\nand  Rodrik  2001).\n\nIn sum, initial income, \u201cDoing-Business \u2013 1\u201d and starting costs turn out to be the important\nvariables that matter for poverty.  In some contrast to the results for the growth regressions, this\nsuggests more room for policies that could fuel private sector activities in the economy. The fact\nthat governance and political freedom variables are mostly insignificant suggests that governments\nof  the  same  quality  can  resolve  the  equity\u2013efficiency  trade-offs  in  different  ways.  Noting  that\ngovernance is always significant in growth regressions, this further suggests that the actions to\nbe taken to reduce poverty are quicker than those to increase steady-state growth, which requires\ninstitutional  modification.\n\nVII. CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nIn this paper, we have studied the role of institutions and policies in driving economic growth\nand explaining poverty, paying close attention to institutions and policies that relate to the overall\nclimate  and  regulations  under  which  the  private  sector  operates.  We  find  that  good  governance\nas measured by a strong commitment to the rule of law among other things, matters for poverty\nreduction largely through its effect on economic growth. While the impact of trade openness on\ngrowth is not clear, increases in trade shares have been associated with lower poverty. Furthermore,\nthe size of the public sector has a strong negative effect on growth and can be bad for poverty\nalleviation. While a large public sector can be an asset to the rest of the economy in terms of the\ninfrastructure and social services it provides, it also means that the economy has a relatively smaller\nprivate sector, usually the more dynamic sector. We interpret our regressions to show that in most\ncountries, growth is driven by the dynamism of the private sector, which in turn depends importantly\non  the  quality  of  governance.\n\nLess cumbersome regulations governing private sector operations, especially those pertaining\nto starting a business, matter for both economic growth as well as poverty reduction more directly.\nHowever, it is important to point out that eliminating cumbersome regulations is unlikely to serve\n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 82\n\n35\n\n\fINSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES FOR GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION:\nTHE ROLE OF PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT\nRANA HASAN, DEVASHISH MITRA, AND MEHMET ULUBASOGLU\n\nas a panacea.  There are no doubt regulatory practices that are at best inefficient and at worst\nperhaps  fostering  serious  corruption.  Eliminating  such  practices  will  probably  be  good  for  both\nbusiness as well as economy and for the poor. Our results on starting costs, in particular, are certainly\nconsistent with this notion. At the same time, policymakers must not lose sight of the fact that\nspurring the private sector is unlikely to be driven by the elimination or alleviation of \u201cgovernment\nfailures.\u201d  Spurring the private sector will also require the elimination or alleviation of market failures\nthrough appropriately designed public\u2013private partnerships. The critical challenge for private sector\ndevelopment is probably getting this design correct.  More research in uncovering the nature and\nprocesses that can lead to more effective public-private partnerships is likely to be a higher value-\nadded  activity.  It  is  also  one  that  is  likely  to  require  in-depth,  country-specific  studies.\n\nFinally, political freedom is not associated with either higher growth or lower poverty.  Indeed,\nthe  evidence  here  seems  to  suggest  that  the  delivery  of  good  governance  and  regulations  that\nfacilitate the creation of new enterprises are more relevant for growth and poverty reduction than\nthe  nature  of  the  political  system  per  se.\n\nSELECTED REFERENCES\n\nAcemoglu, D., J.

The evidence suggests that\nregulations that facilitate the creation of new enterprises, and governance indicators that capture\nconduciveness to economic activity as distinct from political freedom, can play an important role in\npromoting growth and reducing poverty.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nThe work of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is aimed at improving the welfare of the people in Asia\nand the Pacific, particularly the 1.9 billion who live on less than $2 a day. Despite many success stories,\nAsia and the Pacific remains home to two thirds of the world\u2019s poor. ADB is a multilateral development\nfinance institution owned by 64 members, 46 from the region and 18 from other parts of the globe.\nADB\u2019s vision is a region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member countries reduce\npoverty and improve the quality of life of their citizens.\n\nADB\u2019s main instruments for providing help to its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans,\ntechnical assistance, grants, guarantees, and equity investments. ADB\u2019s annual lending volume is typically\nabout $6 billion, with technical assistance usually totaling about $180 million a year.\n\nADB\u2019s headquarters is in Manila. It has 26 offices around the world and has more than 2,000 employees\nfrom over 50 countries.\n\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/economics\nISSN: 1655-5252\nPublication Stock No.\n\nPrinted in the Philippines\n\nERD\n\nECONOMICS AND RESEARCH DEPARTMENT\n\nWorking Paper\nSERIES\nNo.82\n\nInstitutions and Policies for\nInstitutions and Policies for\nGrowth and Poverty Reduction:\nGrowth and Poverty Reduction:\nThe Role of Private Sector\nThe Role of Private Sector\nDevelopment\nDevelopment\n\nRana Hasan, Devashish Mitra,\nand Mehmet Ulubasoglu\n\nJuly 2006\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["ERD Working Paper No. 82\n", "INSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES FOR GROWTH\nAND POVERTY REDUCTION:\nTHE ROLE OF PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT\n", "RANA HASAN, DEVASHISH MITRA, AND MEHMET ULUBASOGLU\n", "July 2006\n", "Rana Hasan is Senior Economist in the Development Indicators and Policy Research Division of the Economics and\nResearch Department, Asian Development Bank; Devashish Mitra is Professor of Economics and Gerald B. and Daphna\nCramer Professor of Global Affairs at the The Maxwell School of Citizenship & Public Affairs, Syracuse University; and\nMehmet A.
