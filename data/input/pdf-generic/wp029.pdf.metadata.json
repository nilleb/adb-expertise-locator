This study proposes tax structure and tax administration reforms\nand other complementary policies that these governments can introduce to safeguard\nand enhance revenue collection. First, they can strategically allocate goods among the\nfour CEPT scheme lists. Second, the new member countries can improve their tax systems\nby replacing traditional general sales taxes with Value Added Tax and generally\nsimplifying their tax structures. Third, they can reduce inefficiencies that impede tax\ncollection by improving tax administration institutions and tools. Finally, they can\nimprove their overall legal systems so as to discourage tax avoidance and evasion and\nreduce corruption among tax officials.\n28", "I. INTRODUCTION\nF\nor many years before their recent accession to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations\n(ASEAN), the governments of Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam (CLMV) relied\nheavily on international trade taxes as a source of government revenue. As a precondition\nof joining the trade association these new member countries agreed to comply with the terms of\nthe Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme, which requires that ASEAN members\nreduce tariff rates for and eliminate quantitative restrictions and other nontariff barriers to intra-\nASEAN trade. ASEAN adopted the CEPT scheme on the assumption that over the long term\neliminating such tariffs will reduce the cost of and consequently increase the efficiency of intra-\nASEAN trade. However, the new members, which are also sometimes collectively referred to as\nSoutheast Asian Transitional Economies (SEATEs), generally assume that the presumed increase\nin trade volume will not manifest itself immediately and, therefore, they expect that in the short\nterm the reduction of trade tariff rates will reduce their overall government revenue.\nAssuming that these circumstances will thus reduce the amount of revenue that they derive\nfrom trade tariffs, the governments of CLMV will be forced to take one or a combination of three\npossible courses of action: reduce expenditure, borrow to finance increased deficit, or compensate\nfor revenue loss. The Asian economic crisis of 1997 made governments in Southeast Asia acutely\naware of the need to adequately fund poverty reduction and social protection programs. Therefore,\nthe governments of CLMV are unlikely to be able to reduce expenditures substantially. In general,\nthese countries are also reluctant to significantly increasing current levels of borrowing because\ndoing so would not be fiscally sustainable in the long run, would indicate a lack of fiscal discipline,\nand would greatly increase public debt.\nWithout recourse to substantial expenditure cuts or increased borrowing, the new ASEAN\nmember countries will need to reform their tax structures in order to find new sources of revenue\nto compensate for the shortfalls resulting from the reduction of revenue derived from trade tariffs.\nOne major structural reform that some of these countries have already made is the substitution\nof value added tax (VAT) for general sales tax. This reform is especially promising because VAT\nis more broadly based than general sales tax and also because VAT complements a more export-\noriented economic stance. This paper examines how this and other tax reforms are likely to help\nthe new ASEAN members compensate for the expected short-term loss of revenue from trade tariffs.\nIt also discusses other important tax administration and legal reforms that the governments of\nCLMV should consider to safeguard revenue collection in general. In addition, the paper analyzes\nhow the new member countries can strategically participate in the CEPT scheme to make tariff\nrevenue reduction gradual and less severe.\n1", "ERD Working Paper No. 29\nHOW CAN CAMBODIA, LAO PDR, MYANMAR, AND VIET NAM COPE WITH REVENUE LOST DUE TO AFTA TARIFF REDUCTIONS?\nII. TAXATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES\nA. Developed versus Developing Countries\nIn considering the most advisable program of tax reform for the governments of the new\nASEAN members, it is important to note that differing circumstances necessitate differing\napproaches to taxation in developing countries compared to developed countries. The incidence\nof market failure is higher in developing countries than in developed countries because developing\nmarkets are relatively less sophisticated and involve fewer market players. Developing countries\nare also much more susceptible to the immense negative effects of extreme poverty. Therefore,\ndeveloping countries have a strong justification to intervene in the economy by resorting to such\nmeasures as corrective taxes and regulatory instruments. Given the magnitude of the economic\nand social problems that developing countries face, the potential advantages to be derived from\ngovernmental intervention outweigh the potential cost of governments acting unsuccessfully.\nTherefore, the task of taxation in developing countries is likely to be more substantial than it is\nin developed countries (Burgess and Stern 1993).\nIn developing countries governments need substantial resources to finance their activities,\nbut they raise less tax revenue than their more developed counterparts. Total tax revenue to GDP\nis higher and direct taxes to GDP form a greater portion of total revenue in developed countries.\nBy contrast, in developing countries nontax revenue constitutes a relatively higher proportion\nof total revenue (see Table 1). However, nontax revenue is neither as consistent nor as sustainable\nas tax revenue. Nontax revenue is defined as revenue remitted by departmental and public\nTable 1.

Many\nliberalized developing countries plan to privatize public enterprises because the private sector\ncan perform those economic functions more efficiently. Because nontax revenue will therefore\ndecline, these governments must garner more tax revenue. These facts all serve to suggest that,\nin consideration of overall economic priorities, developing countries urgently need to improve tax\ncollection more than developed countries.\nB. ASEAN Countries\n1. Tax Revenue Collection\nThe case of Cambodia provides an excellent example of how important tariffs are as a source\nof overall tax revenue in the new ASEAN member countries. In 1997, 58.1 percent of total tax\nrevenue collected in Cambodia came from international trade taxes. Among the new ASEAN\nmembers, trade taxes constitute an average of 32.1 percent of overall tax revenue compared with\nthe figure of 11.4 percent for old members (see Figure 1). This suggests that among the new ASEAN\nmembers trade tariffs have been used not only to protect domestic producers from import\ncompetition but also that the governments of these countries have been relying on tariffs as a\nFigure1.TaxRevenuebyTypeofTaxinASEANCountriesin1997\n100 5.8.01.449 23.16 11.78 4.71 01.70.034 8.00 133..5523 33..0715 26.91\n90 23.00 15.43 30.66\n25.51\n80 51.39 47.42\ne\nvenu 70 27.89 32.36 32.22 219..9471\ne\nR\nax 60 38.02 62.58\nT\nal\not 50\nT 30.53\nof 44.35\nt 40 34.57 41.71\nn 39.90\ne\nc\ner 30 35.53\nP 31.27\n24.69\n20\n18.42\n10\n6.81\n0\nCambodiLaao PDVRiet NPahmilippinMesyanmaMr alaysiTahailanInddoneSsiiangapore\nOthertaxes DomesticTaxesonG&S\nTaxes(cid:1) International TaxonI,P&C.G.\ntradetransactions\nSources:GovernmentFinanceStatisticsYearbook(IMF2001),IMF\u2019sCountryReports\nforCambodiaandLaoPDR.\n3", "ERD Working Paper No. 29\nHOW CAN CAMBODIA, LAO PDR, MYANMAR, AND VIET NAM COPE WITH REVENUE LOST DUE TO AFTA TARIFF REDUCTIONS?\nsignificant source of government revenue. Unfortunately for these countries, their adoption of\nthe CEPT scheme is likely to reduce their overall revenue because the scheme reduces inter-ASEAN\ntariff rates (see Figure 2). This change will be especially challenging for the new ASEAN members\nbecause their tax bases have always been quite small, which means that they have limited options\nfor shifting this tax burden elsewhere. Informal and nonmonetarized activities, which by their\nnature are not taxable, constitute a significant portion of the domestic economies of these countries.\nThe bases for direct taxes on such items as income, profits, and capital gains are also highly\nrestricted.\nFigure2.TaxesonInternationalTradeinSEATEs1997-2000\n70\n60\ne\nu\nn\ne 50\nv\ne\nR\nal 40\nt\no\nT\nof 30\nt\nn\ne\nc\ner 20\nP\n10\n0\nCambodia LaoPDR Myanmar VietNam\n1997 1999\n1998 2000\nSources:IMFCountryReportsandGovernmentFinanceStatisticsYearbook2001.\nThe tax bases of the new ASEAN member countries are restricted because there are very\nfew taxpayers in their formal sectors who have high taxable income or consumption. Consequently,\nthe governments of CLMV have low ratios of tax revenue to GDP. In Cambodia and Myanmar\ntax revenue constitutes less than 10 percent of GDP (see Table 2). This suggests that Cambodia\nand Myanmar are not putting enough effort into revenue collection and that perhaps excessive\nadministrative constraints were already limiting their revenue regime prior to their ASEAN\naccessions. Since their accessions to ASEAN, the ratios of total revenue to GDP in CLMV have\nbeen falling. This phenomenon should motivate the governments of CLMV to begin efforts now\nto compensate for such potential revenue loss throughout the 10-year period during which CEPT\nis to be implemented.\n4", "Section II\nTaxation in Developing Countries\nTable 2.

Institutional Tax Structure\nIn considering the tax revenue disparity between developing and developed countries, it\nis tempting to assume that the cause stems from a difference between institutional structures,\nor in other words, that developed countries employ superior tax regimes and impose higher tax\nrates. However, upon closer examination, it becomes clear that the institutional structures and\nstatutory rates do not differ significantly, which in turn suggests that the solution to this problem\nmust be sought elsewhere. This section and Table 3 compare the personal income, corporate income,\nand domestic consumption tax rates of ASEAN and selected Organization for Economic Co-operation\nand Development (OECD) countries.\nThe rates for the top brackets of personal income tax in the selected developed countries\nare higher than those of ASEAN-61 but comparable to those of the SEATEs, except for Cambodia.\nHowever, there are generally more brackets of taxable personal income in the ASEAN countries\nthan in the selected OECD countries. This relatively larger number of income brackets suggests\nthat the governments of the ASEAN countries are trying to use personal income tax to effect income\nredistribution.\nCorporate income tax rates are generally the same in both ASEAN and OECD countries,\nthe only noticeable difference being that some of the countries employ a single corporate income\ntax rate while others use multiple rates.\n1 ASEAN-6 refers to the first six ASEAN members.\n5", "ERD Working Paper No. 29\nHOW CAN CAMBODIA, LAO PDR, MYANMAR, AND VIET NAM COPE WITH REVENUE LOST DUE TO AFTA TARIFF REDUCTIONS?\nTable 3.

It is levied on domestically produced and imported goods and services.\nIn general, the OECD countries employ higher domestic consumption tax rates than the\nASEAN countries. Value Added Tax (VAT) is the most popular type of consumption tax both in\nOECD countries and among the original ASEAN member countries. Among the new ASEAN\nmembers, Cambodia and Viet Nam have already adopted the VAT as their comprehensive\nconsumption tax. However, Lao PDR is only considering adopting VAT in 2004 and Myanmar has\nno plan to comprehensively implement VAT (see Table 4).

IMPACTS OF CEPT AGREEMENTS\nA. CEPT and AFTA\nThe CEPT scheme is a cooperative arrangement among ASEAN member countries that\nreduces intraregional tariffs and nontariff barriers (NTBs). Signatory countries agree to remove\nnontariff barriers within five years after joining CEPT. According to the scheme, members agree\nto gradually reduce intraregional tariffs on imported goods2 to 0-5 percent over a 10-year period.\nASEAN-6 countries started to implement the CEPT on 1 January 1993. Cambodia, Lao PDR,\nMyanmar, and Viet Nam will implement the CEPT Scheme on a different schedule. Viet Nam\nwill reduce tariffs on all manufactured goods to 0-5 percent by 2006, Lao PDR and Myanmar by\n2008, and Cambodia by 2010.\nThe CEPT scheme is expected to make ASEAN\u2019s manufacturing sector more efficient and\ncompetitive in the global market. AFTA has become a larger market for manufacturing producers\nwithin the region. Investors can enjoy economies of scale in production. Through this arrangement,\nASEAN hopes to enhance competitiveness, improve the investment climate, and attract foreign\ndirect investment.\nB. CEPT Product List\nUnder the CEPT scheme, each ASEAN member country must independently allocate goods\nthat are subject to tariffs to one of four lists. The four lists determine the schedules according\n2 Imported goods include both (1) manufactured and processed agricultural products and (2) unprocessed\nagricultural and products. At least 40 percent of the contents must originate from any member of ASEAN in\norder to be considered as ASEAN products.\n7", "ERD Working Paper No. 29\nHOW CAN CAMBODIA, LAO PDR, MYANMAR, AND VIET NAM COPE WITH REVENUE LOST DUE TO AFTA TARIFF REDUCTIONS?\nto which each country will reduce tariff rates on listed goods. The names of the lists are: Inclusion\nList (IL), Temporary Exclusion List (TEL), Sensitive List (SL), and General Exception List (GEL).\nThe schedules for tariff rate reductions are also determined by the nature of the goods; manufactured\nand processed agricultural products are subject to earlier rate reductions, not the nonprocessed\nagricultural products.\nThe IL contains goods on which each country agrees to reduce tariff rates within 10 years\nto 0-5 percent. The IL is also subdivided into two tracks, the Normal Track and the Fast Track.\nEach member is free to reduce tariff rates on goods in the Normal Track at any time over the\n10-year period. However, members are also encouraged to place as many goods as possible on\nthe Fast Track and to reduce tariff rates on goods in that track within five to eight years.\nThe TEL is intended to give countries leeway to put off tariff rate reductions on certain\ngoods of concern. Countries need not begin to reduce tariff rates on goods in the TEL during the\nfirst three years after joining CEPT. Thereafter, goods in the TEL are to be transferred to the\nIL gradually. The ASEAN secretariat recommends that members transfer goods from the TEL\nto the IL in five equal installments so as to evenly distribute the revenue impact of tariff rate\nreductions.\nThe SL is meant to contain unprocessed agricultural goods that are of even greater concern\nto the member than those contained in the TEL. Eventually each member must reduce to 0-5\npercent the tariff rates on goods in the SL, but these reductions need not begin earlier than eight\nyears after joining CEPT, and members are given a period of nine years to complete those reductions.\nFinally, the GEL contains goods that are not subject to tariff rate reductions. The provision\non General Exceptions in the CEPT Agreement is consistent with Article X of the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Goods may be placed on the GEL if such listing is deemed\nnecessary for protecting national security, public morals, human/animal/plant life, and health.\nGeneral Exception is also allowed for goods of artistic, historic, or archaeological value. General\nException is normally applied to arms and weapons, alcoholic beverages,3 and tobacco products.\nOnce a member country has allocated goods to the four lists, it must submit its results\nto the ASEAN Council for approval. The lists are also reviewed annually and are thus subject\nto annual revision. Since all members must reduce tariff rates on goods in the IL within 10 years,\nthe ASEAN-6 countries must do so by 1 January 2003, Viet Nam by 2006, Lao PDR and Myanmar\nby 2008, and Cambodia by 2010. In addition to reducing tariff rates on goods in the IL, countries\nmust remove quantitative restrictions and nontariff barriers on those goods (see Table 5).\n3 Alcoholic beverages are classified under the GEL in all ASEAN countries except Myanmar, Philippines, and\nThailand.\n8", "Section III\nImpacts of CEPT Agreements\nTable 5.

Products classified under FT are subject to tariff rate reduction of 0-5 percent in 5-8 years.\nSource: http://www.moc.go.th/thai/dbe/ecoco/rt/asean/afta.htm\nC. Eligibility for CEPT Tariff Rate Reductions\nIn order for an exporter to enjoy reduced tariff rates under the CEPT scheme, the exported\ngood must appear in the ILs of both the exporting and importing countries, must have been approved\nby the AFTA Council as part of a tariff reduction program, and no less than 40 percent of its content\nmust have originated from ASEAN member countries.4 Within the AFTA, each ASEAN member\ncountry has the right to set tariff rates on imports in accordance with the CEPT scheme. Therefore,\none product may be subject to different tariff rates depending on which country in the free trade\narea imports the good. Under other regional trade agreements such the European Union, all member\ncountries must apply the same tariff rates to the same imported goods.\nD. Strategic Compliance with the CEPT Scheme\nThe AFTA is one of the least restrictive regional trading arrangements.5 Although members\nmust remove barriers to intra-ASEAN trade, they are individually free to impose trade barriers\n4 The local requirement refers to both single country and cumulative ASEAN content.\n5 Custom unions, common markets, and economic unions require that member countries adopt not only uniform\ntariff rates on same products but also common external commercial relations such as a common external tariff.\n9", "ERD Working Paper No. 29\nHOW CAN CAMBODIA, LAO PDR, MYANMAR, AND VIET NAM COPE WITH REVENUE LOST DUE TO AFTA TARIFF REDUCTIONS?\non nonmembers. This stands in contrast to the European Union (EU) and Mercosur (Argentina,\nBrazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay), in which members must impose uniform tariff rates on nonmember\ncountries. The CEPT scheme also gives members freedom to set tariffs on intra-ASEAN trade\nat any rate between 0 and 5 percent. Furthermore, due to the Asian financial crisis of 1997, certain\nlong-standing member countries have not fully complied with requirements of the CEPT scheme\nin spite of written deadlines, a fact that has not resulted in their exclusion from AFTA. Although\nthis is not to suggest that the new member countries should join the free trade area with the\nintention of not complying with CEPT requirements, they must take into consideration the actual\nbehavior of other members as well as any emergency circumstances that may arise.\nAccording to the CEPT schedule, by 2017 all of the current ASEAN member countries must\nreduce intra-ASEAN tariff rates on all but General Exception goods to a maximum of 5 percent\n(Table 5). Consequently, the new ASEAN members have considerable freedom to determine how\nthey will comply with the CEPT scheme. In one respect, the new members are free to set tariff\nrates on various goods in their IL anywhere in the range of 0-5 percent, which calls for careful\nconsideration. The new ASEAN members must be careful to avoid overambitiously reducing tariff\nrates to 0 percent, as Lao PDR has done with certain goods. In another respect, the new members\nare also free to determine which goods they will place on which list according to the strategic\nimportance of those goods.\nIt is important for the new ASEAN members to identify which goods they can or might\nbe able to produce with a relative competitive edge so that they can add those products to their\nILs and benefit from reduced tariffs when exporting those goods to other ASEAN countries. At\nthe same time, they must also identify which of their own domestic industries need more time\nto adjust to trade liberalization so that they can place those goods on their TELs or SLs.\nUnfortunately, it is not easy to identify which industries might enjoy a comparative advantage.\nDoing so requires that countries make accurate projections based on comprehensive information\nfrom both the formal and informal sectors.\nThe ASEAN-6 member countries have not strictly observed CEPT tariff rate reduction\nschedules, especially since the outbreak of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Certain countries have\nyet to add numerous goods to their ILs even though their under-10-year limit has nearly expired.\nAfter the Asian financial crisis, the Malaysian government postponed the transfer of certain\nautomotive products from their TEL to their IL from the originally scheduled date of 1 January\n2003 to 2005.6 Some ASEAN members have recently been calling into question the practicality\nof rules of origin for intra-ASEAN imports. It is particularly difficult for the less developed new\nASEAN member countries to identify the origins of imported goods\u2019 content. Singapore has signed\nand is discussing more bilateral free trade agreements with several other non-ASEAN members.\nSome ASEAN member countries are concerned that goods from nonmember countries will flow\ninto ASEAN and enjoy the intra-ASEAN lower tariff rates via their routing through Singapore.\n6 These are 218 line items in Malaysia\u2019s TEL that are Completely Build-up and Completely Knock-Down automotive\nproducts.\n10", "Section III\nImpacts of CEPT Agreements\nE. Revenue Impact of CEPT\nThe CEPT scheme seeks to make possible a freer flow of trade by reducing the inhibiting\nfactor of trade tariffs, which in turn is intended to facilitate local specialization and wealth creation.\nThis advantage brings with it the expense of potentially reducing the revenue that member countries\nderive from tariff revenues. Thus CEPT creates a trade-off between facilitating overall free trade\nand reducing governmental tariff revenues. Countries that depend heavily on international trade\ntaxes as a source of governmental revenue stand to lose more than others. Thus, countries like\nCambodia, where the majority of total tax revenue derives from trade taxes, are more concerned\nabout the revenue cost of participating in AFTA than they are about the benefit that ASEAN\nmembership might bring in terms of export promotion (Menon 1998).\nMenon (2000) analyzed the effect that the CEPT scheme would have on revenue in Lao\nPDR and concluded that the size of shortfall in revenue derived from tariffs would be moderate.\nMenon discussed several factors that suggest this conclusion, namely: (i) economic growth will\nlead to an increase in the volume of imports, (ii) a significant share of tariff revenue in the SEATEs\nis collected on goods that are in the GEL such as alcoholic beverages and cigarettes, and (iii) the\nshare of formal trade on which tariffs can be levied will increase, since there is less incentive for\nsmuggling when tariff rates are low. Menon also concluded that the overall impact of revenue\nfrom trade taxes in the absence of significant trade diversion would depend on (i) the size of the\ntariff reduction; (ii) the growth in recorded imports as a result of tariff cuts; and (iii) indirectly,\nthrough the increase in economic activity associated with trade liberalization.\nThe following sections investigate what impact joining the CEPT scheme will have on tariff\nrevenue in the new ASEAN member countries, taking into consideration how much revenue will\nbe lost as a result of tariff rate reduction, growth in imports, and tax reforms. Table 6 summarizes\nthe framework used to analyze the revenue impact of the CEPT.\n1. Tax Revenue Reduction\nThis section estimates the baseline scenario in which import patterns do not change and\nno tax reforms are implemented. In estimating revenue loss, one must factor in the scheduled\ntransfers of line item goods from other lists to the Inclusion List. Each new ASEAN member has\nadopted its own unique initial CEPT Product List and transferring schedule (see Table 5).\nIdeally, the estimation for revenue loss should be based on all individual line items of the\nimported goods in the CEPT Product List. The latest schedule to which each country has committed\nitself for reducing tariff rates on each line item in the CEPT scheme, called 2001 CEPT package,\nis available for all member countries including the SEATEs. This information is posted on the\nASEAN Secretariat website. Table 7 summarizes the allocation of traded products among the four\nCEPT lists.\n11", "ERD Working Paper No. 29\nHOW CAN CAMBODIA, LAO PDR, MYANMAR, AND VIET NAM COPE WITH REVENUE LOST DUE TO AFTA TARIFF REDUCTIONS?\nTable 6.

Such statistics can only\nbe obtained by inquiring with the customs departments of the respective countries. Due to resource\nlimitations, that data was not available for this study. Customs departments are generally reluctant\nto publicly disclose detailed information about disaggregated values and volumes of trade because\ngovernments normally use this information to set revenue targets. The sensitivity of such data\nmakes it difficult to quantitatively assess revenue loss from tariff rate reductions.\nIn lieu of the abovementioned data, it is also possible to assess revenue loss by examining\nthe volume of each country\u2019s intra-ASEAN imports along with its average tariff rate and the\nschedule of tariff reduction. The more each country relies on intra-ASEAN imports, the more\nrevenue will be lost from the reduction to tariff rates in the baseline scenario. Since the CEPT\nscheme will reduce tariff rates to 0-5 percent, any country that previously imposed tariff rates\nmuch higher than 5 percent will lose relatively more revenue as a result of tariff rate reductions.\n12", "Section III\nImpacts of CEPT Agreements\nTable 7.

Average CEPT Tariff Rates\nThe average CEPT tariff rates on goods in the new members\u2019 ILs vary considerably. In\n2001, the average CEPT tariff rate was highest for Cambodia, the newest ASEAN member, at\n10.4 percent; Myanmar had the lowest at 3.32 percent. Viet Nam is the oldest ASEAN member\namong SEATEs, but its average CEPT tariff rate was still relatively high at 7.09 percent the same\nyear. The average CEPT tariff rate for Lao PDR in 2001 was 6.58 percent.\nIn addition to the evidence presented in Table 10, the effect that joining the CEPT scheme\nwill have on the revenue of Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam is indicated by  (i) the\nportfolio of imported products in the CEPT lists presented in Table 7 and (ii) the degree and trend\nof each country\u2019s dependence on imported taxes for overall tax revenue in Figures 1 and 2.\n15", "ERD Working Paper No. 29\nHOW CAN CAMBODIA, LAO PDR, MYANMAR, AND VIET NAM COPE WITH REVENUE LOST DUE TO AFTA TARIFF REDUCTIONS?\nTable 10.

This conclusion is suggested by the following\nfacts: (i) Cambodia has the highest average tariff rate for goods in its IL, i.e. 10.40 percent; (ii)\nCambodia has placed more goods on its TEL than Lao PDR, Myanmar, or Viet Nam;7 and (iii)\na higher percentage of Cambodia\u2019s total tax revenue derives from taxes on international trade\nthan any of the other new ASEAN members.\nImported goods are generally subject to trade tariffs, excise taxes, and domestic consumption\ntaxes. Since the CEPT scheme reduces tariff rates, it should consequently reduce the amount that\nconsumers pay for consumption taxes on imported products. However, from the perspective of\nthe tax collector this implies both a direct and an indirect loss of tax revenue. In the first place,\nthe government will be able to collect less revenue from tariffs because of reduced tariff rates.\nSecondly, because the cost of imports to consumers is lower, the government will also collect less\nrevenue from consumption taxes.8 This point reemphasizes how important it is for Cambodia,\nLao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam to reform their tax structures in order to cushion the potentially\nnegative impact on their tax revenue collection of accession to ASEAN.\n3. Import Growth from Tariff Reduction\nTrade liberalization in the form of reduced tariff rates may stimulate growth in recorded\nimports (i) because importers might choose to begin recording imports that they previously did\n7 Without precise data on the volume of trade for each good, it is impossible to quantitatively predict how much\nrevenue will be lost as a result of tariff rate reductions. Therefore, these predictions are based on the law of\npossibility.\n8 Consumption tax collection can be calculated from the following formula: Consumption Tax Collection = [(import\nvalue + import duties) x average effective rate of consumption tax]\n16", "Section III\nImpacts of CEPT Agreements\nnot report and (ii) because of the price effect. If this were to occur, then governments might be\nable to maintain previous levels of or even to increase the amount of revenue that they collect\nfrom tariffs, even though tariff rates are reduced. In the first instance, consumers of imported\ngoods will increasingly begin to record imports if they expect that the newly reduced tariff rates\nwill be less costly to them than the smuggling premium. This is particularly relevant to Cambodia,\nLao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam where unrecorded trade is prevalent. Empirical evidence that\nthe price effect can stimulate growth in imports is provided by the case of the Philippines in the\nlate 1980s. At that time tax reforms and trade liberalization were accompanied by a new surcharge\non nonoil imports. As a result, the ratio of trade taxes to GDP and to total tax revenue increased\nsignificantly even as the rates of trade taxes declined modestly (Ebril et al. 1999, 11).\nWhile they were implementing the CEPT scheme during the 1990s, recorded imports\nincreased in each of the ASEAN-6 countries. In fact, the average annual rate of growth in imports\nwas higher in the 1990s than it was during the 1980s for all of the ASEAN-6 countries except\nSingapore and Thailand (see Table 11).\nTable 11.

TAX REFORMS\nDue to their commitment to reduce tariff rates according to the schedules under the CEPT\nscheme, the governments of Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam will have to rely less\non trade taxes as a source of total tax revenue. Consequently, these countries now realize the\nurgency of reforming their tax structures to cope with the expected losses in the medium to long\nterm. As Pich Rithi, Deputy Director-General of Ministry of Commerce, Cambodia stated in his\nspeech (see http://www.moc.gov.kh/econo_intergration/impage_economic-trade.htm) on the impact\nof economic and trade liberalization on Cambodia, the first challenge that Cambodia will be facing\nin joining ASEAN is the expected loss of import tax revenue. He concluded that, \u201cCambodia needs\nto reform its tax structure in order to compensate for the expected loss of import duties in the\ncoming 10-15 years.\u201d\nEffecting the type of tax reforms referred to above normally involves replacing trade taxes\nwith domestic indirect taxes, which are less distorted in terms of resource allocation and\nconsumption. Developing countries generally tend to depend on import duties to generate revenue\nand to protect domestic import-substitution industries. These import duties raise the domestic\nprice of imported goods. Therefore, they discourage the domestic consumption of imported goods\nand consequently encourage the allocation of resources to inefficiently produce the same goods\ndomestically.\nA. Introduction of the Value Added Tax\nIn order to facilitate trade liberalization, many developing countries have introduced Value\nAdded Tax (VAT). Implementing VAT can help to compensate for the revenue that is often lost\nwhen a country reduces or eliminates import duties. This form of tax also complements a policy\nof trade promotion because VAT is broad-based and a trade-neutral, domestic indirect tax. VAT\nis normally administrated using the credit mechanism and is based on the destination principle.\nThe credit mechanism allows sellers to claim credit for any VAT that they pay when purchasing\ninputs that are required to produce the goods or services that they sell. The sellers are eligible\nto redeem those VAT credits against any VAT that they are liable to pay when they sell the goods\nor services. Sellers claim those VAT credits by providing invoices for the VAT that they paid on\ntheir inputs. In this regard, VAT has the advantage of discouraging tax evasion because taxpayers\nthemselves wish to pay and obtain receipts for VAT paid on inputs purchased in order to be able\nto claim credit against the VAT they themselves will be required to pay at the point of selling\ntheir end product or service. Since receipts are required at both ends of the transaction, taxpayers\nthemselves provide checks against one another. The same cannot be said for other types of general\nsales taxes such as turnover tax and retail sales taxes.\nThe destination principle is consistent with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\n(GATT) guidelines, which stipulate that taxes on goods and services be levied in the country where\nthey are consumed (destination principle) rather than where they are produced (origin principle).\n19", "ERD Working Paper No. 29\nHOW CAN CAMBODIA, LAO PDR, MYANMAR, AND VIET NAM COPE WITH REVENUE LOST DUE TO AFTA TARIFF REDUCTIONS?\nIn other words, the destination principle requires that taxes be imposed on imports while exports\nare not subject to taxation. Therefore, domestic and foreign producers are able to compete on an\neven playing field because their goods are subject to the same consumption tax rates.9\nVAT is levied on a broad-based domestic consumption but effectively leaves a zero tax rate\non exports. Therefore, VAT complements the type of export-oriented economic stance that all of\nthe AFTA members have adopted. VAT collections in Cambodia and Viet Nam have proven to\nbe very buoyant. From 1996 to 1998 the government of Viet Nam collected an amount of revenue\nthrough turnover tax equivalent to 11.1 to 11.8 percent of its GDP. Since VAT replaced turnover\ntax in 1999 the government has collected through VAT revenue amounting to more than 17 percent\nof its GDP from 1999 to 2001 (IMF Country Report No. 02/5). In Cambodia, the sales tax-to-GDP\nratio prior the VAT introduction in 1999 was only 0.7 and 0.9 percent in 1997 and 1998. Since\n1999, the ratio increased to 2.7-3.2 percent from 1999 to 2001 (IMF Country Report No. 02/24).\nB. Surcharges on Luxuries and Nonessentials\nWhile reducing the intra-ASEAN tariff rates, new ASEAN member countries can temporarily\nimpose surcharges on luxuries and nonessentials in order to safeguard tariff revenue loss.10\nHowever, such surcharges must also be levied on domestically produced luxuries according to the\nGeneral Most-Favored-Nation Treatment Principle of the GATT. Most luxury products are not\nlocally produced in the new ASEAN member countries. This temporary revenue measure can\ncompensate the tariff revenue loss without damaging local industries during the transitional period\nof greater liberalization. The governments of CLMV should also note that the GATT allows countries\nthat experience a Balance of Payment Crisis to raise custom duties and impose quota restriction\nof importation.11 However, such relief must be approved and is subject to periodic review by the\nWorld Trade Organization in consultation with the International Monetary Fund.\nC. Simplification of Tax Structure\nThe governments of Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam should simplify their\ntax structures and make them more transparent in order to improve the efficiency of tax\nadministration and to make it easier for taxpayers to pay taxes. International experiences suggest\nthe following reforms. A single tax rate is preferred to multiple tax rates in corporate income tax\nand general consumption taxes (with exemptions on some necessary goods such as unprocessed\nfood and medicines). The corporate income tax should be levied in a single statutory rate equivalent\n9 Of course, imported goods are subject to additional costs, such as overseas shipping and handling costs and\nimport duties before consumption taxes are levied. By contrast domestic goods are not subject to handling costs\nand import duties.\n10Examples of luxury goods include yachts, perfumes, chandeliers, lead crystals, air conditioners, wool carpets,\ncigars, etc.\n11See details in GATT Articles XII and XV.\n20", "Section IV\nTax Reforms\nto the highest personal income tax. The top marginal rates for personal income taxes should be\nkept between 30 to 50 percent so that they do not discourage individuals from earning more income\nor evading taxes. Tax exemptions and allowances or tax expenditures should be minimized. These\nprovisions not only erode the already narrow tax bases in developing countries, but also complicate\ntax administration (World Bank 1991).\nD. Tax Administration Reforms\nThe governments of Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam have considerable room\nto improve both their tax administrations and their tax collecting efforts. These governments\ncollected low levels of revenue as a percentage to GDP prior their ASEAN accessions. The\ncommitment to the CEPT will only put more pressure on these governments to improve their tax\nefforts and administration while implementing other structural reforms.\nTax administration reforms involve the following issues: administrative and legal\narrangements, organization, management, functions, and resources of tax administration.\n1. Legal Arrangements, Organization, and Management\nThe responsibilities of the two main administration bodies responsible for tax collection\nand tax and customs administration must be clearly defined and their efforts must be synchronized\nwith the entire tax and public administrative systems. In order to establish efficient, effective,\nand targeted tax arrangements each government must assess the (i) respective levels of\nadministrative capacity and (ii) must coordinate the activities of the tax and customs\nadministrations. Each government must decide which of the two administrations is responsible\nfor collecting what aspect of VAT and under what circumstances. They also need to clearly define\nthe responsibilities of both national and subnational tax administrations. The governments should\nalso aim to improve coordination among all VAT collectors. Some recent innovations regarding\ntax administration organization include the creation of a separate Tax Police and a Large Taxpayer\nUnit. The purpose for establishing a Tax Police is to assess accuracy of tax filing and payment\nso as to discourage both tax avoidance and evasion among taxpayers as well as rent-seeking activities\namong tax collectors. The purpose for establishing a Large Tax Unit is to increase cost efficiency\nin collecting taxes. Due to the existing high income disparity, large taxpayers contribute a relatively\nhigher proportion to total revenue in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam than do large\ntaxpayers in other ASEAN member countries.\n2. Functions and Resources\nThe main functions of tax administration include (i) information-related functions in dealing\nwith taxpayers, (ii) actual tax collection and sanctioning noncompliance, and (iii) international\ntax cooperation with other tax administrations.\n21", "ERD Working Paper No. 29\nHOW CAN CAMBODIA, LAO PDR, MYANMAR, AND VIET NAM COPE WITH REVENUE LOST DUE TO AFTA TARIFF REDUCTIONS?\nIn dealing with taxpayer information, a tax administration largely involves gathering and\nprocessing information. To obtain information from taxpayers, an effective and efficient tax\nadministration must employ a good system for assigning identification numbers to and registering\ntaxpayers. The information function also encompasses the tax withholding system, assessing asset\nownership, and educating taxpayers about tax compliance in order to keep their compliance costs\nlow.\nIn terms of tax collection, an efficient filing system and accurate assessment of taxpayers\u2019\ntax liability improve the efficiency and effectiveness of tax administration. A reliable and effective\ntax auditing system is also necessary to improve tax compliance. Actual tax collection requires\nmechanical collection of taxes from both taxpayers who make payments on time and from those\nwho delay tax payments.\nIn an increasing globalized world, international tax cooperation with other administrations\nhas become increasingly beneficial to improve tax administration. Exchanging information on lessons\nlearned and cooperating in tax collection puts tax authorities in a better position to cope with\ntax collection problems in a more complex environment. In the Asian and Pacific region, the Study\nGroup on Asian Tax Administration and Research (SGATAR) holds annual meetings to discuss\nissues related to tax administration and cooperation among group members.12 The governments\nof CLMV have not yet been actively involved in SGATAR, but they should consider getting involved\nnow as they have been engaging in greater liberalization.\nComputerization, modernization, and harmonization of import declarations should be made\na priority in order to facilitate effective and efficient tax administration. More importantly, good\nsystems and equipments must be operated by capable and honest tax officials.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nOver the long term, the ASEAN seeks to improve the efficiency of trade among member\ncountries by reducing tariff barriers to intra-ASEAN trade. This objective assumes that free trade\nwill benefit all participants by allowing each to develop those goods and services that they can\nproduce more efficiently and cost effectively than can their competitors. Unfortunately, for late\njoiners of the Association, ASEAN membership will likely reduce the amount of revenue that their\ngovernments will be able to derive from trade tariffs because it forces governments to reduce tariff\nrates.\nThere are four measures that new ASEAN member countries can implement in order to\nreduce the negative impact on the amount of revenue that they derive from taxation. First, they\n12SGATAR was established in 1970 for organizing loose and informal meetings among selected Asian tax\nadministrations. Members of SGATAR include Australia; People\u2019s Republic of China; Hong Kong, China;\nIndonesia; Japan; Republic of Korea; Malaysia; New Zealand; Philippines; Singapore; Taipei,China; and Thailand.\nSo far, there are 31 meetings held in different member countries. The 32nd meeting is in Thailand in November\n2002.\n22", "Selected References\ncan strategically allocate goods among the four CEPT scheme lists so as to minimize the tariffs\nthat will be imposed on the goods that promote the production of goods that they most wish to\nexport while simultaneously maximizing the amount of revenue that they are able to garner from\nimports. Second, the new member countries can improve their tax systems by replacing traditional\ngeneral sales taxes with VAT and generally simplifying their tax structures. Third, they can reduce\ninefficiencies that impede tax collection by improving tax administration institutions and tools\nof tax administration such as information systems, statistical indicators, etc. Finally, they can\nimprove their overall legal systems so as to discourage tax avoidance and evasion and reduce\ncorruption among tax officials.\nSELECTED REFERENCES\nAbed, G.
