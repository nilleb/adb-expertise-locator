The country is located at the \ncrossroads between Europe and Asia in the \nsouthern Caucasus. Approximately 65% of the \ntotal population lives in urban areas, of which \none-third lives in the capital, Yerevan. \n\nArmenia declared its independence in 1991. \nThe official language is Armenian, but Russian \nis widely spoken. The country is made up of \n11 administrative\u2013territorial units, including \nYerevan and 10 marzes (provinces). \n\nThe Head of the State is the President who \nappoints the person nominated by the \nparliamentary majority to be the Prime \nMinister. The Prime Minister appoints \nministers to comprise the Cabinet of Ministers. \nThe legislative power consists of a single-\nchambered National Assembly (Parliament). \n\nSince the breakup of the Soviet Union, \nArmenia\u2019s transition to a free market-\noriented economy has been characterized \nby agricultural land privatization, price \nliberalization, financial sector restructuring, \nand development of an appropriate legal \nframework for private enterprise.\n\nSince independence, Armenia has been in \ndispute with Azerbaijan over the territory \nof Nagorno-Karabakh, and thus Armenia\u2019s \nborders with Azerbaijan and Turkey have been \nclosed. At present, the main trade links are \nlimited to low-capacity rail, road connections \nwith Georgia and its Black Sea ports, and  \na single road with Iran.\n\nArmenia is a lower middle-income country \nwith a gross national income per capita of \n$3,250. Armenia is committed to democracy, \nstrengthening civil society, and respecting \nhuman rights. The country has ratified \nseveral international conventions and treaties \npromoting these principles. \n\nCivil Society: An Overview\n\nArmenia acknowledges civil society participation as an \nimportant component of public administration processes,  \nin particular the role of nongovernment organizations (NGOs) \nand political parties. NGO participation in the country\u2019s \ndemocratization processes has been significant.\n\nAfter the devastating earthquake of December 1988 and during \nthe years of conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, unions and other \nassociations were heavily involved in relief and humanitarian \nefforts. The Government of Armenia was unable to cope with \nthe situation itself and, therefore, it had to accept the active \nparticipation of civil society organizations (CSOs). \n\nFrom 1988, major international organizations and  \ninternational NGOs started arriving in Armenia. Alongside \nhumanitarian aid, they contributed to the development of the \nlocal nongovernment sector. Among the first international \nNGOs operating in Armenia were Armenian Technology Group, \nCARE International, Catholic Relief Services, Oxfam Great Britain \nArmenia, Save the Children, and United Methodist Committee \non Relief. Also, the Armenian Diaspora provided humanitarian \naid and contributed greatly to the rehabilitation process. Its \nactivities in Armenia are still coordinated through international \nNGOs, including Hope, the NGO Center (NGOC), and the \nArmenian Relief Society.\n\nThis period can be considered the first stage in the formation \nof local NGOs. The focus of these new NGOs was on refugees, \nwomen, children, the elderly, and the disabled. NGOs\u2019 \ninability to meet growing demand for emergency services and \noperations was due to the limited scope of NGOs\u2019 activities;  \nlack of local NGO skills, knowledge, and capacities; and absence \nof an appropriate legal framework.\n\nThe gradual increase in the number of international NGOs in \nArmenia and the corresponding need to regulate the activities \nof all types of CSOs led to the Government of Armenia adopting \nits first Law on Civil Society Organizations in 1996. The law \nencouraged international NGOs to shift their activities from \nemergency response to development, the protection of human \nrights, and enhancing the capacity of local NGOs. \n\n\fA local NGO movement started to develop in the \nmarzes (provinces) as well. Local NGOs began \nimplementing projects in education, health, culture, \ncommunity development, and income generation. In \n1997, the number of local NGOs reached more than \n500. By 2001, data from the State Register showed \nthat there were 2,585 NGOs officially registered. Some \ndistinguished local NGOs include the\n\n \u0084\n\n \u0084 Armenian Constitutional Legal Centre, which \nestablished a Human Rights South Caucasus  \nRegional School in Vanadzor (the third largest city  \nin Armenia) for training teachers to be specialized  \nin human rights; \nYerevak, which implements community \ndevelopment projects. Within the project \nframework, a new model was developed by the \nNGO; and\nShen (meaning a well-to-do village in Armenian), \nwhich provides initiatives related to community \ndevelopment, income generation, food processing, \nand clean water in rural areas. The main goal of the \norganization is to turn abandoned, isolated villages \ninto prosperous communities. Shen\u2019s main office  \nis based in Yerevan, and it has branch offices in \nseven marzes.\n\n \u0084\n\nThe NGO experience in \nArmenia shows that CSOs can \nmake important contributions \nto the development of the \neconomy, education, health, \nand other fields. Moreover, \nlocal NGOs in Armenia have \nparticipated in legislative \nand political reforms and \nin the implementation and \nmonitoring of national \nanticorruption programs.\n\nIn 2010, the State Register reported 45 international \nNGOs and 5,700 local NGOs. However, out of the  \ntotal number of local NGOs registered, only 977  \nare continuously operational.\n\n \u0084\n \u0084\n\ninfrastructure development and construction; and\ncapacity building and technical assistance for  \nlocal CSOs, self-governing bodies, and  \ncommunity councils.\n\nThe NGO experience in Armenia shows that CSOs can \nmake important contributions to the development \nof the economy, education, health, and other \nfields. Moreover, local NGOs in Armenia have \nparticipated in legislative and political reforms and \nin the implementation and monitoring of national \nanticorruption programs. \n\nLocal NGO activities in Armenia can be categorized as\n\nAlthough CSOs have made efforts in exchanging \ninformation, creating coalitions, and coordinating their \nactivities and campaigns, the CIVICUS Civil Society \nIndex (CSI)1 data show that these efforts are insufficient \nso far. Fragmentation and competition among CSOs \noccur frequently, resulting in an ineffective system \nfor Armenian CSOs. Working together would enable \nArmenian CSOs to band together and share resources, \nand thus have a greater impact on society.\n\n \u0084\n \u0084\n \u0084\n\n \u0084\n \u0084\n \u0084\n \u0084\n\nhumanitarian aid organizations;\ngender, children, youth, and minorities; \nsustainable development in education, health, \nagriculture, science and technology, and  \ncommunity development; \nhuman rights, civil society, and democracy;\nenvironmental, including biodiversity issues;\ncultural and art, and sports; and\nlegal services, accountancy and management \nservices, social services for disabled and elderly \npeople, and research and analytical services.\n\nCorruption is a growing problem in Armenia. \nTransparency International\u2019s 2009 indicators for \ncorruption revealed a worsening situation despite \nvarious anticorruption initiatives. One anticorruption \nprogram of the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment (USAID)\u2014Mobilizing Action Against \nCorruption (MAAC)\u2014has been operating since 2007 and \nincludes a component that supports CSOs in developing \ninnovative approaches to combat corruption. The project \nencourages civil society to advocate systemic changes \nin the government and issues grants to local NGOs for \nimplementing anticorruption projects.\n\nInternational NGOs can be classified under the same \ncategories as local NGOs, but with two additional \ncategories:\n\nAlongside their achievements, today, local CSOs  \nin Armenia face several constraints and challenges. \n\n\fBecause of limited coordination among CSOs,  \nthe sector lacks updated information and a database \nof NGOs. This creates an inadequate picture of these \norganizations and, consequently, gives people a poor \nperception of NGOs. This also affects the ability of \nNGOs to influence the decision-making process in  \nthe public administration sphere.\n\nToday\u2019s unfavorable relevant legislative framework \ndoes not provide the NGO sector with an opportunity \nto acquire alternative financing. Therefore, limited and \nunsustainable funding from donors and the government \nmake the NGO sector more dependent, affecting \ntheir independence and sustainability. Accountability \nof NGOs is a major issue. Few NGOs produce annual \nreports and financial statements. On the other hand, \nthe NGO sector in Armenia is still in its developing stage \nand is new to society.\n\nStagnating leadership in NGOs is conditioned by  \ntwo factors. First, founders of NGOs hold their \npositions for a long term, which affects the formation \nof independent boards of directors, and second, the \ninstability of work in the NGO sector does not attract \nyoung specialists.\n\nDue to the sector monopolization, access and \nparticipation of local NGOs in international and regional \nnetworks are limited. Only financially well-established \norganizations are involved in these networks. \nUnderdeveloped impact assessment techniques do not \nallow NGOs to provide beneficiaries with adequate \nservices and influence decision-making processes.  \nAnd lastly, to provide guarantees for efficient operation \nof the sector, legislative amendments (which are not \nforthcoming) are required.\n\n\fFrom 1988 to 1992, NGOs were \nheavily involved in responding \nwhen the country faced \nhardships, including an influx of \nrefugees, the post-earthquake \nrecovery, border closure, and \nthe energy crisis. Recognition \nof NGOs\u2019 contributions to \nthe strengthening of civil \nsociety fostered a new stage \nof expanded cooperation \nbetween state bodies and \nnonprofit organizations.\n\nGovernment\u2013Civil Society Relations\n\nFrom 1988 to 1992, NGOs were heavily involved \nin responding when the country faced hardships, \nincluding an influx of refugees, the post-earthquake \nrecovery, border closure, and the energy crisis. \nRecognition of NGOs\u2019 contributions to the \nstrengthening of civil society fostered a new stage \nof expanded cooperation between state bodies \nand nonprofit organizations. Over the last 5 years, \nthe government has passed decrees, regulations, \nmemorandums, and agreements related to cooperation \nwith NGOs, and formed institutional bodies and units \nranging from community to national levels. \n\nToday, government programs focus on NGO \npartnerships and participation on various levels. The \ngovernment has become more willing to cooperate \nand enter into dialogue with NGOs. The previous \nconfrontation between the government and NGOs \nhas dissipated and shifted to dialogue. Both sides \nseek mutual solutions, and thus the environment for \ngovernment\u2013NGO cooperation has improved.\n\nSome state bodies are open to social partnerships \nfor their programs. These bodies have developed \npartnerships with NGOs and signed agreements to \njointly implement projects.\n\nBelow are some examples of cooperation between \ngovernment structures and NGOs:\n\nThe Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MLSA)2 \nconsiders itself a pioneer in cooperation with NGOs. \nMLSA has introduced innovative approaches that \nhave led to successful outcomes. MLSA made \namendments to its charter and is committed to closely \ncooperate with NGOs. The Ministry has also specified \nits cooperation spheres with NGOs: i) exchange of \ninformation; and ii) teamwork in developing and \ndiscussing legal draft bills. The following methods for \njoint cooperation have been developed and are being \nimplemented: public relations awareness campaigns; \nseminars for journalists; public discussions on pension \nreforms and integral social services; and publication \nof educational posters, brochures, and books (such as \na book on the \u201cEthical Code for Journalists in Dealing \nwith Disabled People\u201d). \n\nPresently, MLSA cooperates with the National Assembly \nPublic Network and with the Network for the Protection \nof Disabled People\u2019s Interests and Rights. Moreover, \nleaders of some NGOs are members of the Collegial \nBoard to the Minister with equal voting rights. For more \nthan 2 years, MLSA has delegated services to NGOs with \npartial financing from the state budget. In the case of \none NGO, Bridge of Hope, AMD51.3 million ($134,000) \nwas allocated from the state budget for salaries of the \nNGO\u2019s four branches. Presently, the Ministry cooperates \nwith about 200 local NGOs. MLSA considers NGOs as \nflexible organizations that can provide qualified and \nlow-cost services by engaging volunteers. \n\nOther ministries closely collaborating with NGOs are  \nthe Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education  \nand Science, and the Ministry of Justice.\n\nThe Legal Framework for Civil Society\n\nThe first law on CSOs was adopted on 22 December \n1996. Currently, CSO activities are regulated by an \nimproved law on CSOs adopted on 4 December 2001. \nThe law states that Armenia recognizes the crucial \nrole of NGOs in the development of civil society and \naims to promote the establishment of NGOs as legal \nentities. The 2001 law specifies that \u201can NGO is a \nnot-for-profit organization that, in accordance with \nlegislation, unites individuals to carry out activities and \nprotects the basic human rights of individual members \nand other citizens.\u201d An NGO may be founded by at \nleast two individuals, or it may be created through \nthe reorganization of an existing NGO. An NGO\u2019s \ncharter should be adopted during a general meeting \nof the founders. The same meeting shall elect the \n\n\fNGO\u2019s management and the board. An authorized \nrepresentative of the newly founded NGO should \ndeliver the organization\u2019s charter for state registration. \nThe charter should express an NGO\u2019s main goals. \nMembers of an NGO have the right to be present \nduring NGO meetings, to be elected as members  \nof the board, to familiarize themselves with \ndocumentation belonging to the NGO, and to appeal \ndecisions made by the NGO\u2019s governing body. \n\nMany NGOs believe that the adoption of a Law on \nSocial Cooperation by the Government of Armenia  \nis required for NGOs to operate more efficiently.  \nThe 2004 World Learning \u201cAssessment of RA NGO \nSector\u201d survey3 found that 64% of NGOs are not \nsatisfied with the existing law or with the current \nlegislative framework on NGOs, while 18% of them \nwere not even aware of the relevant legislative \nframework. They believe that the amended law should \ninclude a provision allowing them to undertake income-\ngenerating activities and paid services. Many NGOs \nwant the law to be further amended so that they can \nperform income-generating services in order to raise \nfunds for development activities.\n\nIn 2010, the government reviewed and amended the \nlaw. The new draft bill on regulating NGOs\u2019 activities \nsubmitted by the government has been criticized by \ncivil society. More than 300 NGOs expressed opposition \nto changes in the law and demanded that the Ministry \nof Justice recall the draft legislation from the National \nAssembly. NGO representatives claimed that the \nproposed amendments would violate the independence \nof NGOs, create unnecessary administrative delays, \nand enable the government to interfere with NGOs\u2019 \nactivities. The National Assembly conducted hearings \nof the draft bill, which was sent to the government for \nrevision and is still pending.\n\nTax Treatment of CSOs\n\nAlthough CSOs and NGOs are nonprofit organizations, \nthe state tax policy is applicable to both commercial \nand noncommercial organizations. NGOs are subject \nto the same taxes as commercial entities. The only tax \nprivilege is provided by Article 8 of the RA Law on Profit \nTax. This article states that assets (such as property, \nmonetary funds, and services), which are provided \nto NGOs gratis, are exempted from profit tax. Value-\nadded tax (VAT) exemption for NGOs is granted for \nimplementing certain projects funded by international \ndonors, such as the United Nations, World Bank, \nUSAID, Technical Aid to the Commonwealth of \nIndependent States (TACIS), and Asian Development \n\nBank (ADB). The relevant commission can grant a \nVAT exemption to charity projects on a case-by-case \nbasis. NGO representatives frequently request a more \nfavorable tax regime for NGOs. However, the issue has \nnot been resolved.\n\nRegistration Requirements for NGOs \n\nFor an NGO to register in Armenia, the founders \nmust submit an application to the Ministry of Justice. \nThe application must also include the minutes of the \ngeneral meeting, the organization\u2019s charter, and the \npassport data of founders of the organization. The \nauthorized state body shall examine the application \nand supporting documents within 21 days and give \na final answer in writing. The registration fee is \nAMD10,000 ($27). \n\nThe registration requirements and rules regulating \nthe activities of local NGOs are equally applicable to \ninternational NGOs operating within Armenia.\nAll registered NGOs are entered into a centralized State \nRegistry within the Ministry of Justice. Information on \nthe registration procedure is publicly available. Upon \nrequest, the Ministry of Justice provides information on \nindividual NGOs for a fixed fee.\n\nAccording to the law, authorized state bodies may \nrequire an NGO to submit information on its activities. \nIn addition, NGOs have to present quarterly and annual \nreports on their finances to the Tax Inspectorate.\n\nToday, government programs \nfocus on NGO partnerships and \nparticipation on various levels. \nThe Government has become \nmore willing to cooperate and \nenter into dialogue with NGOs. \nThe previous confrontation \nbetween the Government \nand NGOs has dissipated and \nshifted to dialogue.\n\n\fUmbrella and Coordinating Bodies\n\n \u0084\n\nimprove the Armenian laws through wider \nparticipation of civil society representatives.\n\nCooperation between the National Assembly and NGOs \noccurs through the Public Network4 of NGOs, unions, \nand foundations registered in Armenia. It was founded  \nin 2008 to support the establishment and development  \nof civil society and strengthen public participation in the \nlaw-making process. The main goals of the Network are to\n\n \u0084\n\n \u0084\n\n \u0084\n\n \u0084\n\nprovide an objective assessment of the problems  \nin society,\npresent civil society groups\u2019 concerns and views  \nat the National Assembly,\nimprove the effectiveness of decision-making \nprocesses,\nencourage public initiatives, and\n\nThe Public Network\u2019s main activities are expert \nconsultations, permanent consultations with the \nNational Assembly standing committees and ministries, \nspecial meetings, and public discussions. Currently,  \nthe Network has 108 member organizations, and  \nit has signed a cooperation agreement with the \nNational Assembly. \n\nCivil Society Community Gateway\nThe Civil Society Community Gateway provides \ninformation on NGOs, public funds, and CSOs.  \nIts website (www.armgateway.org) includes contact \ninformation and a short description of their goals  \nand objectives. \n\n\fThe Government is implementing its 2009\u20132021 \nSustainable Development Program (SDP), which is \nthe revised version of the Poverty Reduction Strategy \nProgram (PRSP).5 The SDP Civil Cooperation Network \noperates within the framework of the Program and \nincludes 140 organizations. NGOs\u2019 roles in the PRSP \ninclude participation in the Program\u2019s development, \nimplementation, monitoring, and revision procedures. \nPublic participation is obligatory for the Program, \nand NGOs have equal voting rights in the Program\u2019s \nSteering Committee and in the working groups.  \n\nPublic Counsel (PC) was established in 2009 under the \nPresident of Armenia. NGOs are consolidated in various \ncommittees and subcommittees. \n\nUnfortunately, there is no NGO coordination center \nin Armenia. However, there are several sector-specific \ngroups of NGOs.\n\nIn 2003, Oxfam Great Britain Armenia initiated the \nCivil Society Partnership Network (CSP), and today, it \ncomprises 26 local organizations. CSP\u2019s priorities include \nadvocating for quality and affordable primary health \ncare for the most vulnerable and poor populations, \nsupporting rural smallholders and small farmers\u2019 \nlivelihoods, and strengthening good governance at the \nlocal level. \n\nEnvironmental Public Alliance (EPA) was created \nin 2002 and now includes 40 NGOs engaged in \nenvironmental, social, legal, human rights, and \nanticorruption concerns. EPA\u2019s main goal is to address \necological, social, and legal issues. The Alliance holds \nmeetings and discussions with National Assembly \ndeputies; EPA experts participate at National Assembly \nsessions. Currently, EPA cooperates with the Ministry of \nNature Protection and the Ministry of Agriculture. \n\nCivil Society Directories\n\nThe Professionals for Civil Society NGO (PFCS) was \nfounded in December 2004 by the staff of World \nLearning, Inc. PFCS has been implementing projects on \nthe sustainability and strengthening of Armenian NGOs. \nIt maintains a website (www.ngo.am/NGO Directory) \nwith an Armenian NGOs database and is regularly \nupdated.

First, data from the State Register of \nArmenia show that the number of local NGOs increased \nfrom 2,585 in 2001 to 2,750 in 2004 and to 5,700  \nby 2009. \n\nSecond, World Learning\u2019s \u201cAssessment of RA NGO \nSector\u201d survey in 2004 found that, in the 1990s,  \n70% of NGO leaders were women. However, by 2001,  \n58% of NGO leaders were men, and in 2009, the \npercentage of male NGO leaders was 63%. While \nthe Government of Armenia and the Armenian CSOs \nare committed to gender mainstreaming, particularly \nenhancing women\u2019s roles in decision-making processes, \nmen came to view NGOs as a job opportunity and a \nmeans to further their careers. \n\nThird, 75 international NGOs were operating in Armenia \nin 2004, but recently, the number has decreased. \nThe number of registered international NGOs at the \nState Register was only 45 in 2009. The reason for \nthis decline may be the stable economic growth in \nArmenia in 2006 and 2007. Many NGOs believe that \nif donor organizations leave Armenia, the scope of \nNGOs\u2019 activities will be curtailed and many of NGOs will \nbecome nonoperational due to a lack of funding. \n\nThe Armenian business sector does not invest in NGO \ndevelopment. If they do support them, the investment \nis limited to one-time, ad hoc charitable giving. Of the \n5,700 registered local NGOs, only 977 organizations are \noperational. The rest are either nonoperational, newly \nestablished, or operate only when awarded grants. \n\nThe Government of Armenia has developed policies \nfor NGOs\u2019 participation in state programs and aims \nto strengthen NGOs\u2019 capacities. Although NGOs \nprovide a wide array of services related to sustainable \ndevelopment, a considerable number of them have  \nlow capacities and are grant dependent. \n\nCivil Society Funding in Armenia\n\nActivities of Armenian NGOs are heavily reliant on \nexternal funding. Some donor organizations work \ndirectly with NGOs, while others operate on a bilateral \nor multilateral basis. The Armenian Diaspora also assists \nthe local NGO sector by allocating funds or providing \nin-kind assistance.\n\nSince independence, Armenia has received considerable \nexternal funding. The major multilateral sources of \nfunding have been the International Monetary Fund; \nWorld Bank; International Development Agency;  \nUnited Nations agencies; European Bank for \nReconstruction and Development; European Union; \nADB; and other bilateral donors, including France, \nGermany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland,  \nand the United Kingdom.\n\nOut of the technical assistance to the Commonwealth \nof Independent States (TACIS) during 2002 and 2003, \n\u20ac10 million was allocated to Armenia and an additional \n\u20ac0.6 million provided for education and culture aimed \nat promoting democracy and governance. \n\nIn 2003, USAID allocated $12.5 million directly to the \nArmenian CSOs and NGOs. Among the 75 international \nNGO recipients, 17 closely cooperated with local NGOs. \n\nWithin the scope of Counterpart International \nArmenia\u2019s Civic Advocacy Support Program (CASP),7 \nthe Partnership and Teaching NGO (P&T) was selected \nby CASP as an Intermediate Service Organization \nto build institutional capacity of the local P&T NGO \nand establish creative partnerships. Accordingly, \nP&T received funds to develop the capacity of its \norganization\u2019s staff. The funds allocated for the NGO \nare shown in the table below.\n\nFourth, transparency for NGOs should consist of at \nleast producing and disseminating annual reports and \nfinancial statements. However, the majority of Armenian \nNGOs think that the preparation of reports requires \nadditional financial expenses. Reporting by NGOs needs \nstronger regulation by the government. Requiring NGOs \nto report on their finances and activities would improve \nthe public\u2019s perception of NGOs. \n\nYear\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\nAmount Given by CASP \n(in AMD)\n\nNGO Contribution  \n(in AMD)\n\n50,000\n\n2,833,352\n\n1,644,650\n\n3,386,495\n\n0 \n\n242,000\n\n167,750\n\n2,123,913\n\nAMD = dram, CASP = Civic Advocacy Support Program, \n\nNGO = nongovernment organization.\n\n\fThe Civil Society Fund, formerly known as the Small \nGrants Program,8 is one of several programs supported \nby the World Bank, which has provided grants since \n1999 to NGOs and other CSOs in Armenia. The grants \nsupport activities related to civic engagement, and \nthe focus is on empowering people who have been \nexcluded from society\u2019s decision-making processes. \nThe maximum individual grant is equivalent to about \n$10,000. So far, 61 local NGOs have received grants. \nThe amount of funds disbursed by the World Bank\u2019s \nYerevan Office totaled $348,000.\n\nShen\u2019s annual budget comes from external donors\u2019 \nsources. Shen is fairly typical of large local NGOs in \nArmenia in its funding structure. The table below  \nshows donor contributions for 2008:\n\nThe Armenia Resident \nMission was opened in 2008 \nand provides the primary \noperational link between \nADB and the government, \nprivate sector and civil society \nstakeholders in its activities.\n\nLocal NGOs face difficulties in finding alternative \nsources of financing.

In Armenia, the  \nfocus is on upgrading the Agarak\u2013Kapan\u2013Yerevan\u2013Bavra road, which links with Georgia\u2019s \nsouthern corridor. \n\nProject 1 is reconstructing 18 kilometers of road corridor between Yerevan and Ashtarak  \nto the north, and between Yerevan and Ararat to the south.\n\nThe NGO Center for Bird Lovers is expected to be involved in monitoring of environmental \nissues and in raising public awareness.\n\nNGO participation: the NGO Environmental Survival monitored four villages in the Sevan \nregion of Gegharkunik marz and raised public awareness as well \n\nThe project focuses on optimizing the operation of existing infrastructure and maximizing \nthe operating efficiency of service providers. This will allow the project to economize the \ninvestment, achieve considerable development impacts, and ensure sustainability of the \nwater supply and sewerage system with sound technical and financial management. The \nproject will cover 16 towns and 125 villages. The project will improve public health and the \nenvironment for about 576,000 people living in the project towns and villages, about 25% \nof whom live below the poverty line.\n\nThe project has a Governing Council, and the following four NGOs serve as members on  \na rotational basis: \n\n1. Environmental Survival carried out monitoring and related public awareness in four \n\nvillages of Sevan region of Gegharkunik marz.\n\n2.

It is distinct from the government and the private sector and consists of a diverse range of individuals, \ngroups, and nonprofit organizations. They operate around shared interests, purposes, and values with a varying degree \nof formality and encompass a diverse range\u2014from informal unorganized community groups to large international \nlabor union organizations. Of particular relevance to ADB are nongovernment organizations, community-based \norganizations and people\u2019s organizations, foundations, professional associations, research institutes and universities, \nlabor unions, mass organizations, social movements, and coalitions and networks of civil society organizations (CSOs) \nand umbrella organizations.a\n\nADB recognizes CSOs as development actors in their own right whose efforts complement those of governments and the \nprivate sector, and who play a significant role in development in Asia and the Pacific. ADB has a long tradition of interacting \nwith CSOs in different contexts, through policy- and country strategy-level consultation, and in designing, implementing,  \nand monitoring projects.\n\nIn 2008, ADB launched Strategy 2020, which articulates the organization\u2019s future direction and vision until 2020.b Above \nall, Strategy 2020 presents three complementary strategic agendas to guide ADB operations: inclusive economic growth, \nenvironmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. These agendas reflect the recognition that it is not only the \npace of growth, but also the pattern of growth, that matters in reducing poverty in the region. In this new strategic context, \npartnerships with a range of organizations, including CSOs, will become central to planning, financing, implementing, and \nevaluating ADB projects.\n\na  ADB.
