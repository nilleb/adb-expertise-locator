It is distinct from the government and the private sector and consists of a diverse range of individuals, \ngroups, and nonprofit organizations. They operate around shared interests, purposes, and values with a varying degree \nof formality and encompass a diverse range\u2014from informal unorganized community groups to large international \nlabor union organizations. Of particular relevance to ADB are nongovernment organizations, community-based \norganizations and people\u2019s organizations, foundations, professional associations, research institutes and universities, \nlabor unions, mass organizations, social movements, and coalitions and networks of civil society organizations (CSOs) \nand umbrella organizations.a\nADB recognizes CSOs as development actors in their own right whose efforts complement those of governments and the \nprivate sector, and who play a significant role in development in Asia and the Pacific. ADB has a long tradition of interacting \nwith CSOs in different contexts, through policy- and country strategy-level consultation, and in designing, implementing,  \nand monitoring projects.\nIn 2008, ADB launched Strategy 2020, which articulates the organization\u2019s future direction and vision until 2020.b Above \nall, Strategy 2020 presents three complementary strategic agendas to guide ADB operations: inclusive economic growth, \nenvironmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. These agendas reflect the recognition that it is not only the \npace of growth, but also the pattern of growth, that matters in reducing poverty in the region. In this new strategic context, \npartnerships with a range of organizations, including CSOs, will become central to planning, financing, implementing, and \nevaluating ADB projects.\na  ADB.
