These replace the former Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) and Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). The procurement policy and the \nprocurement regulations address the procurement activities of project executing \nagencies and implementing agencies on projects financed in whole or in part by a \nloan or grant from ADB, or by ADB-administered funds. ADB designed the 2017 \nprocurement policy to deliver significant benefits and flexibility throughout the \nproject procurement cycle, as well as to improve project delivery through a renewed \nfocus on the concepts of quality, value for money (VFM), and fitness for purpose.\nThis note is part of a series of guidance notes published by ADB in 2018 to \naccompany the 2017 procurement policy and the procurement regulations. \nEach\u00a0note discusses a topical issue for borrowers (including grant recipients), \nbidders, and civil society under the new framework (see list below).

When a project is delivered promptly or when a \nprocess is completed rapidly, greater value is created for all stakeholders. For example, a \nroad project completed early provides economic benefit, security, or other value to the \ncommunity it serves. It increases the return on investment to the executing agency and \naccelerates the project and payment cycle to the successful bidder. Likewise, a project \ndelivered late loses significant value. \nWhen considering VFM in the context of procurement, pay attention to anything \nthat (i)\u00a0shortens the procurement cycle time frame or (ii) accelerates delivery of the \ndevelopment project.", "About This Publication vii\nobjective\nThis guidance note is intended to assist readers by elaborating on and explaining  \nADB\u2019s 2017\u00a0procurement policy and procurement regulations for borrowers \n(including grant\u00a0recipients). \nThis note identifies additional information for the reader to consider when applying ADB\u2019s \nprocurement policy and procurement regulations to their circumstances. \nliving document\nThis guidance note is intended to be a living document and will be revised as required.\nBe sure to check the ADB Business Center website for the latest version and updates, \nhttps://www.adb.org/business/main.\nthe reader \nIn many circumstances, readers are expected to use this guidance note in a manner unique \nto their needs.

OCB consolidates the competitive procurement of goods, \nworks, and services (both nonconsulting and consulting services) under a single \nprocurement method. This method facilitates open competition among all eligible \nbidders, regardless of whether procurement contracts are advertised internationally \nor nationally, or whether the procedures are based on the Procurement Regulations \nfor ADB Borrowers; Goods, Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting Services (2017, \nas amended from time to time), the national system, or the rules of another \ndevelopment partner under the mechanism of mutual reliance.1\n1.2  The arrangements for OCB are based on procurement and supply market \nrisk assessments. Its defining feature is effective and appropriate advertising \nthat provides as many qualified bidders as possible equal opportunity to bid for \ncontracts.

General Principles\n4.1  The evaluation criteria must be carefully chosen to allow the right balance \nof price and quality to be assessed, and ensure that VFM will be achieved under \nthe resulting contract. Factors to consider include the type, nature, and value of \nthe procurement; market conditions; complexity; risk; and objective of what is \nbeing procured; as well as socioeconomic or environmental objectives, fitness \nfor purpose, and the bidder\u2019s record of achieving the desired results based on \nexperience and performance history.10 The evaluation criteria must be clearly \nspecified in the bidding documents and describe all factors that will be considered, \nand the methodology by which they will be quantified or evaluated.\n4.2  In cases when quality standards of the technical requirements can be \nestablished and measured easily by referring to technical specifications or well-\nestablished industry standards, applying evaluation criteria that consider life cycle \ncosts and the cost to the borrower of nonmaterial commercial and technical \ndeviations will help to achieve VFM. Life cycle costs include costs of operation \nand maintenance, licensing, additional features, consumables, disposal, etc. This \nwill then facilitate the calculation of an evaluated bid price for each bidder. The \ncontract will be awarded to the bidder offering the lowest evaluated cost for goods, \nworks, and services substantially meeting those technical requirements. This will \nbe the case for standard off-the-shelf goods and equipment, standard works, and \nstandard nonconsulting services.\n4.3  For certain contracts, however, VFM is more likely to be achieved by \napplying evaluation methods that allow for an assessment of the balance between \ncost and quality according to the needs of the borrower as well as the project\u2019s \nintended development objectives. In such cases, the use of nonprice criteria  \n(e.g., point scoring) may be suitable. Such cases may include\n(i)  where quality needs to be measured by comparison among bidders, \nbased on an assessment of qualifications, experience, and/or \nperformance;\n(ii)  complex solutions consisting of a combination of goods, works, and/or \nservices; or\n10  The Guidance Note on Consulting Services Administered by ADB Borrowers has further details on \nevaluation criteria for OCB consulting assignments.", "Selecting Evaluation Criteria 99\n(iii) infrastructure, equipment, or services involving proven or high-level \ntechnology that improves the quality of the goods, works, or services \nprovided.\nB.   Excessive Criteria and Requirements \n4.4  Evaluation criteria (including bidding requirements affecting the awarding \nof the contract to a bidder), which are intended to mitigate risks of supplier or \ncontractor nonperformance (rather than addressing technical or commercial \nnonconformities), should not be excessive. For example, excessive bidding or \nevaluation requirements include\n(i)  borrower staff visiting the bidders\u2019 manufacturing or reference sites to \nassess a bidder\u2019s capacity;\n(ii)  bidders being requested to provide samples of goods to assess \ncompliance with the technical requirements; or\n(iii) bidders being requested to provide original copies of documents,  \ne.g., original signed contract document as evidence of a previous \nsimilar contract.  \nThis reflects that the contract signed with the winning bidder will itself have built-in \nperformance risk mitigations, e.g., contractual provisions that address contractor \nperformance issues, including liquidated or delay damages, performance guarantee, \nadvance payment to the contractor (supported by an advance payment guarantee \nheld by the employer), etc. \n4.5  If there is a compelling need for any such requirements, they can \nbe requested or undertaken after the winning bidder has been awarded the \ncontract, before or at the time of contract signing. The nonfulfillment of any such \nrequirement will not affect the awarding of the contract or the contract price. \nContractual provisions are sufficient to address any issues that may become \napparent after the contract has been awarded.", "V.\u2003Preparing bidding documents\n5.1  The use of OCB is supported by a suite of SBDs to promote consistency \nand legal certainty across procurement processes. The specific SBD to be used for \na procurement contract will depend on the (i) nature, complexity, and value of the \ngoods, works, and/or services required; (ii) desired bidding procedures (e.g., single-\nstage or two-stage bidding with one or two envelopes); and (iii) any application \nof alternative procurement arrangements (i.e., procurement rules of the lead \ncofinancier or accredited agency of the borrower). \n5.2  The bidding document for a particular contract will be prepared by the \nborrower (through its project executing or implementing agency) and provided \nto prospective bidders who purchase it, or to applicants or firms that have been \nprequalified or shortlisted.

Borrowers may use their local SBDs \nor those of other development partners, provided that such are \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s 2017 procurement regulations.\n(iv) Local language bidding documents with provisions requiring (a) bids \nto be submitted in the local language, (b) bid prices and payment \ncurrency limited to local currency, and/or (c) bid and performance \nsecurity (if used) restricted to local banks or in forms different from \nthose allowed by ADB for international advertising, may be used \nfor those contracts procured using national advertising, provided \nthey are authorized to be used by local procurement laws, rules, and \nregulations deemed acceptable as indicated in the procurement plan.\n(v)  Customized bidding documents may be used where an SBD will not, \nwithout the customizations, satisfy the core procurement principles, \nsubject to ADB\u2019s review and no-objection. \nB.   Content of Bidding Documents\n5.4  Bidding documents define the procedures for bidding and the award of \ncontract, and the rights and obligations of the borrower and the bidders throughout \nthat process. While the content of each bidding document will depend on the type, \nvalue, and complexity of the contract, bidding documents will include common \nelements as described in Table 2.\n11  The table excludes consulting services, for which requirements are described in the Guidance \nNote on Consulting Services Administered by ADB Borrowers and in ADB\u2019s standard request for \nproposals document.", "12 Open Competitive Bidding\nTable 1: General Use of Standard Bidding Documents under  \nOpen Competitive Bidding\nNationally Advertised OCB Internationally Advertised OCB\nType of SBD \u2022\tADB\u2019s SBDs\n\u2022\tOther development partners\u2019 SBDs\n\u2022\tSBDs of an accredited agency of the borrower\n\u2022\tCustomized bidding documents\nLanguage of SBD National language and/or  English\nEnglish\nRecommended period for  4 weeks 6 weeks\npreparation of bids\nApplication of domestic  Yes Yesa\npreference\nADB = Asian Development Bank, OCB = open competitive bidding, SBD = standard bidding \ndocument.\na\u2002Where the borrower\u2019s country is eligible for domestic preference as stated in the procurement \nplan.

There must be \nprocedural guarantees (i) against conflicts of interest and (ii) for maintaining the \nconfidentiality of information. ADB strongly recommends that the evaluation \n(and contract award) be completed within the initial period of bid validity, to avoid \nproblems such as bidders not agreeing to extend the validity of their bids. The \nborrower must prepare a detailed report on the evaluation and comparison of bids. \nThe report will specify the basis for recommending that the contract be awarded to \na particular bidder. ADB\u2019s Guide on Bid Evaluation (2018) provides further details \non the bid evaluation process.14\n7.3  If an extension of bid validity becomes necessary and is justified, the \nborrower must request such an extension from all bidders in writing before the \nexpiration date. Bidders may not be requested or permitted to change the price or \nother conditions of their bid, but will have the right to refuse the extension. If the \nbidding documents require a bid security, bidders may exercise their right to refuse \nto grant such an extension without forfeiting their bid security.\n14  ADB. 2018. Guide on Bid Evaluation. Manila. https://www.adb.org/documents/guide-bid-\nevaluation.", "18 Open Competitive Bidding\nA.   Role of Evaluators\n7.4  Good procurement outcomes rely on the borrower\u2019s evaluators having \nappropriate skills, and then exercising those skills and their professional judgment \nto evaluate bids against the bidding document. If the borrower does not have \nsufficient technical or financial skills, consultant support should be arranged.\nB.   Role of Bidders\n7.5  Under the ADB 2017 procurement regulations, \u201cit is the responsibility of \nthe bidder to raise any issue of ambiguity, contradiction, omission, etc., prior to the \nsubmission of its bid to assure submission of a fully responsive and compliant bid \nthat includes all the supporting documents requested in the bidding documents.\u201d15 \nThis means that a bidder cannot rely on the borrower to identify and allow it to \ncorrect its errors by requesting clarification of ambiguities or missing documents \nduring the evaluation process. While there is scope for the borrower to request \nclarifications or missing documents without affecting the substance of the bid or \ntransparency of the bidding process, the borrower is under no obligation to do so.\nC.   Postqualification Procedure\n7.6  In cases where prequalification was not carried out, the borrower \nmust determine if the recommended bidder has the capability and resources to \neffectively carry out the goods, works, or nonconsulting services contract offered \nin the bid. The bidding document contains criteria to be satisfied. The borrower \nshould especially scrutinize the successful bidder\u2019s eligibility, including checking \nthe ADB sanctions list (for all bidders) and its pending litigation, rather than relying \non disclosures of such information in the submitted bidding forms. If the bidder \ndoes not fulfill those criteria, the bid must be rejected and the borrower will need to \nmake a similar determination for the next-ranked bidder. In a single-stage, two-\nenvelope bidding process, all bidders will be subjected to postqualification.\n7.7  The contract is awarded to the bidder who meets the appropriate \nstandards of capability and whose bid has been determined to be substantially \nresponsive to the bidding documents and to offer either (i) the lowest evaluated \ncost or (ii) the best combination of quality and price, as appropriate and according \nto contract type, based on the criteria identified in the bidding documents, \nincluding life cycle costs, wherever applicable.\n15  ADB. 2017.

This may be done only in accordance with a \nscheme that has been identified in the procurement plan.\nE.   Notification Requirements\n7.9  Once the borrower has selected the successful bidder for an internationally \nor nationally advertised contract, it will undertake the following tasks (i) within \n2\u00a0weeks of that decision; (ii) after expiry of the standstill period, where such period \napplies; or, (iii) upon receipt of ADB\u2019s confirmation of satisfactory resolution of the \ncomplaint, if a complaint has been filed within the standstill period:\n(i)  transmit a notice of award to the successful bidder; and\n(ii)  publish the results, identifying the bid and lot or package numbers as \napplicable, in an English language newspaper or widely known and \nfreely accessible website. \n7.10  The publication of the results should contain the following information:\n(i)  the name of each bidder;\n(ii)  the bid prices as read out at bid opening;\n(iii) the name and evaluated prices or appropriate scores of each bid that \nwas evaluated;\n(iv) the name of bidders whose bids were rejected and the reasons for \ntheir rejection; and\n(v)  the name of the winning bidder, and the price it offered or score it \nachieved, as well as the duration and summary scope of the contract \nawarded. \n7.11  When funding projects, ADB \nbox 7\nmay accept the application of national \nstandstill Periods\nstandstill provisions or those of another \nA standstill period suspends the \ndevelopment partner (Box 7).

Evaluation of Bids Against Financial Qualification \nCriteria\nA3.1  When evaluating qualification criteria relating to the financial capacity \nof a bidder (i.e., historical financial performance, average annual [construction] \nturnover, and financial resources), the borrower should be alert to signs that \nthe bidder does not actually have sufficient capacity even though it seems to \ntechnically meet the criteria. For example:\n(i)  audited financial statements (AFS) may mention legal disputes, even \nthough the bidder states elsewhere in its bid that it has no pending \nlitigation or arbitration, or mention ongoing contracts or projects that \nare not included in the bidder\u2019s current contractual commitments;\n(ii)  a bidder may submit consolidated AFS for a group of companies, of \nwhich the bidder is one of those companies, such that the bidder\u2019s \nfinancial capacity will be overstated if consolidated figures are used by \nthe borrower to evaluate the bid;\n(iii) a bidder may insert figures in its bidding forms that are inconsistent \nwith figures in its AFS; and\n(iv) a bidder may use figures from its AFS for total turnover rather than \njust its construction turnover in calculating its annual construction \nturnover.  \nA3.2  The financial information provided by the bidder should be reviewed in \nits entirety to allow a truly informed judgment, and the pass or fail decision on the \nfinancial position of the bidder should be given on this basis. Any abnormal features \nthat may lead to financial problems should alert the borrower to seek expert \nprofessional advice for further review and interpretation.", "24 Appendix 3\nB.   Evaluation of Bids Against the \u201cContracts of  \nSimilar Size and Nature\u201d Criterion\n1.  experience as a Main Contractor versus as a subcontractor\nA3.3  Bidders may be understood as having different roles in their previous \ncontracts, for example:\n(i)  as the \u201cgeneral contractor,\u201d\n(ii)  as the \u201cmain contractor,\u201d or\n(iii) as a \u201csubcontractor.\u201d \nA3.4  These roles involve different degrees of project management and \nactual construction of the works, and may vary from one contract to the next. \nFor this reason, it is necessary to look beyond a broad classification of a bidder\u2019s \nrole as a general or main contractor, or subcontractor and, instead, to focus on \nthe substance of the bidder\u2019s participation in a previous contract, in assessing \nits similarity to the contract being procured. The assessment should consider \nthe bidder\u2019s explanation of the similarity of its previous contract, in the relevant \nbidding\u00a0form.\nA3.5  Therefore, it is possible that, in the same bidding process, two bidders will \noffer the same previous contract to support their qualification for the \u201cContracts \nof Similar Size and Nature\u201d criterion. One bidder may have performed the role of \nthe main contractor and the other bidder may have been the subcontractor that \nconstructed the actual works. The bidders may also claim both a percentage of the \ncontract that exceeds 50% each and/or exceeds 100% of the contract in total. In \nprinciple, this is acceptable: the bidders have different, but overlapping roles, each \nof which may demonstrate that the bidder has sufficient capacity to implement the \ncontract to be procured. \n2.  the Meaning of \u201csubstantially Completed\u201d\nA3.6  Evaluators should exercise their professional judgment, taking into \naccount the nature and complexity of a bidder\u2019s uncompleted previous contract, \nin assessing if it has been \u201csubstantially completed.\u201d The assessment will largely \ndepend on the nature or type of contract. For example, substantial completion of \nworks of a repetitive or contiguous nature, such as the construction of a road, will \nbe different from substantial completion of a turnkey contract for the construction \nof a facility, such as a water treatment plant.\nA3.7  Use of an arbitrary percentage of physical progress or of the value of the \ncontract that has been completed or disbursed can lead to poor procurement \noutcomes. For example, a bidder may meet the arbitrary requirement, but not \nhave actual technical capacity, potentially leading to the bidder being awarded the \ncontract, but not being able to successfully implement it. Alternatively, a bidder ", "Appendix 3 25\nmay have derived adequate technical capacity from its uncompleted contract, \nbut not be able to meet the arbitrary requirement, thereby leading to the bidder\u2019s \nrejection and a weakening of competition.\n3.  evidence of bidder\u2019s Past Contracts\nA3.8  Bidders may be required to provide evidence of their experience, including \nsuccessful past performance. In addition, evaluators may conduct their own due \ndiligence, for example, from the employer of a bidder\u2019s previous contract. When \nevaluators have obtained information from a third party that does not support \nor favor the bidder, the information needs to be formally introduced into the \nevaluation through a request for clarification to the bidder, to give the bidder the \nopportunity to respond to the adverse information. \nA3.9  If the evaluators are concerned that supporting documents provided \nby a bidder are not genuine, the bidder may be requested to arrange reasonable \nattestation or certification to prove their authenticity. A bid cannot be rejected \ndue to failure of a bidder to provide an original version of a document, e.g., a signed \ncontract. If the borrower has a compelling need to see an original version of any \ndocument supplied by the winning bidder, it can be requested after the winning \nbidder has been awarded the contract, e.g., before or at the time of contract signing.", "Open Competitive Bidding\nGuidance Note on Procurement\nWith open competition a key principle in ADB operations, open competitive bidding is \nADB\u2019s preferred procurement method. It consolidates the competitive procurement of \ngoods, works, and services under a single procurement method. This method facilitates \nopen competition among all eligible bidders, regardless of whether procurement \ncontracts are advertised internationally or nationally. Its defining feature is effective \nand appropriate advertising to provide as many qualified bidders as possible equal \nopportunity to bid for contracts. This guidance note advises borrowers on best \npractices in implementing this method for projects financed in whole or in part by an \nADB loan or grant, or by ADB-administered funds.\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its \ndeveloping member countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their \npeople.
