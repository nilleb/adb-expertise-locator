These replace the former Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) and Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). The procurement policy and the \nprocurement regulations address the procurement activities of project executing \nagencies and implementing agencies on projects financed in whole or in part by a \nloan or grant from ADB, or by ADB-administered funds. ADB designed the 2017 \nprocurement policy to deliver significant benefits and flexibility throughout the \nproject procurement cycle, as well as to improve project delivery through a renewed \nfocus on the concepts of quality, value for money (VFM), and fitness for purpose.\n\nThis note is part of a series of guidance notes published by ADB in 2018 to \naccompany the 2017 procurement policy and the procurement regulations. \nEach\u00a0note discusses a topical issue for borrowers (including grant recipients), \nbidders, and civil society under the new framework (see list below).

VFM is part of a holistic procurement structure \nwith three support pillars: efficiency, quality, and flexibility. The two key principles of \ntransparency and fairness weave across all elements of the structure.\n\nt r a n sparency\n\nValue for Money\nThe effective, efficient, and economic use of resources,  \nwhich requires an evaluation of relevant costs and benefits along  \nwith an assessment of risks, nonprice attributes, and/or total cost  \nof ownership as appropriate\n\nefficiency\n\nQuality\n\nFlexibility\n\n\u2022\tDecreased transaction \n\n\u2022\tContract management \n\n\u2022\tOpen competitive \n\ncosts\n\nsupport\n\n\u2022\tIncreased skills\n\u2022\tIncreased high-level \ntechnology usage\n\n\u2022\tImproved \n\nprocurement planning\n\n\u2022\tPrompt resolution of \n\ncomplaints\n\n\u2022\tImproved developing \n\nmember country \nprocurement process \n\n\u2022\tSupport and \n\n\u2022\tImproved \n\nencouragement \nof e-procurement \nsystems\n\nprocurement planning\n\n\u2022\tGovernance\n\u2022\tContracts with clear \nperformance criteria\n\u2022\tMinimal number of \n\ncomplaints\n\n\u2022\tImproved ADB \n\nprocesses \n\nFairnes s\n\nbidding\n\n\u2022\tDecentralization\n\u2022\tAccreditation \nfor alternative \nprocurement \narrangements\n\u2022\tPrinciples-based \n\ndecisions\n\u2022\tImproved \n\nprocurement planning\n\n\u2022\tDelegation\n\u2022\tBids with weighted  \n\nproposal  \ncriteria \n\ntime\n\nTime is an important element of VFM. When a project is delivered promptly or when a \nprocess is completed rapidly, greater value is created for all stakeholders. For example, a \nroad project completed early provides economic benefit, security, or other value to the \ncommunity it serves. It increases the return on investment to the executing agency and \naccelerates the project and payment cycle to the successful bidder. Likewise, a project \ndelivered late loses significant value. \n\nWhen considering VFM in the context of procurement, pay attention to anything \nthat (i)\u00a0shortens the procurement cycle time frame or (ii) accelerates delivery of the \ndevelopment project.\n\n\fAbout This Publication\n\nvii\n\nobjective\n\nThis guidance note is intended to assist readers by elaborating on and explaining  \nADB\u2019s 2017\u00a0procurement policy and procurement regulations for borrowers \n(including grant\u00a0recipients). \n\nThis note identifies additional information for the reader to consider when applying ADB\u2019s \nprocurement policy and procurement regulations to their circumstances. \n\nliving document\n\nThis guidance note is intended to be a living document and will be revised as required.\n\nBe sure to check the ADB Business Center website for the latest version and updates, \nhttps://www.adb.org/business/main.\n\nthe reader \n\nIn many circumstances, readers are expected to use this guidance note in a manner unique \nto their needs. For consistency throughout the suite of guidance notes, the following \nassumption is made about the reader:\n\nThe reader is a professional involved in activities financed in whole or in part by an ADB loan \nor grant, or by ADB-administered funds. \n\nFaQs\n\nFrequently asked questions, clarifications, examples, additional information, links to training, \nand other useful resources will be made available on the ADB website. \n\nBe sure to check the ADB Business Center website for more information, \nhttps://www.adb.org/business/main.\n\nlegal and order of Priority\n\nThis guidance note explains and elaborates on the provisions of the Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers: Goods, Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting Services \n(2017, as amended from time to time) applicable to executing (and implementing) agencies \nunder sovereign (including subsovereign) projects financed in whole or in part by an \ninvestment loan from ADB (i.e., excluding ADB results- or policy-based loans),  \nADB-financed grant (excluding ADB-administered technical assistance and staff \nconsultancies), or by ADB-administered funds. \n\nIn the event of any discrepancy between this guidance note and the procurement \nregulations, the latter will prevail. The financing agreement governs the legal relationships \nbetween the borrower and ADB. The rights and obligations between the borrower and the \nprovider of goods, works, or services are governed by the specific procurement document \nissued by the borrower and by the contract signed between the borrower and the provider, \nand not by this guidance note.\n\n\fviii\n\nabbreViations\n\nADB \n\nAFS \n\nIFB \n\nOCB \n\nSBD \n\nVFM \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\nAsian Development Bank\n\naudited financial statements\n\ninvitation for bids\n\nopen competitive bidding\n\nstandard bidding document\n\nvalue for money\n\n\fexeCutiVe suMMary\n\nix\n\nOpen competitive bidding (OCB) is ADB\u2019s preferred procurement method. \nOCB consolidates the competitive procurement of goods, works, and services \nunder a single procurement method. It facilitates the use of flexible, principles-\nbased procurement arrangements that are responsive to actual procurement \nrisks and supply market conditions and achieve value for money outcomes. This \nguidance note advises borrowers (including grant recipients) on best practices for \nimplementing OCB under projects financed in whole or in part by an ADB loan or \ngrant, or by ADB-administered funds.\n\nEffective use of the OCB method may\n\nIncrease Efficiency and Reduce Procurement Time\n\n\u2022\t Due to the greater flexibility offered by OCB, bidding documents will be \n\nmore appropriate to the contract being procured, enabling faster processing \nof procurement activities and more efficient contract implementation.\n\u2022\t OCB takes more account of supply market conditions to ensure effective \ncompetition and to minimize risk of nonresponsive bids and rebidding.\n\nReduce Risk\n\n\u2022\t OCB arrangements will take account of and mitigate procurement and \nsupply market risks identified through a comprehensive analysis.\n\nDeliver Value for Money\n\n\u2022\t\n\nProperly administered and open equally to national and international \nbidders, OCB will likely result in value for money in most cases. \n\nImprove Fitness for Purpose\n\n\u2022\t OCB arrangements will appropriately reflect the strategic needs and \n\n\u2022\t\n\ncircumstances of the contract to be procured.\nThe arrangements can be customized in case a standardized approach \ncannot effectively and efficiently meet project outcomes and development \nobjectives.\n\n\f\fi.\u2003introduction\n\nThis guidance note aims to assist users in procuring contracts using open \n\n1.1 \ncompetitive bidding (OCB), which is the preferred procurement method of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) due to the importance of open competition \nacross ADB operations. OCB consolidates the competitive procurement of goods, \nworks, and services (both nonconsulting and consulting services) under a single \nprocurement method. This method facilitates open competition among all eligible \nbidders, regardless of whether procurement contracts are advertised internationally \nor nationally, or whether the procedures are based on the Procurement Regulations \nfor ADB Borrowers; Goods, Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting Services (2017, \nas amended from time to time), the national system, or the rules of another \ndevelopment partner under the mechanism of mutual reliance.1\n\nThe arrangements for OCB are based on procurement and supply market \n\n1.2 \nrisk assessments. Its defining feature is effective and appropriate advertising \nthat provides as many qualified bidders as possible equal opportunity to bid for \ncontracts. The activities relating to OCB commence at the project planning stage \nof the ADB procurement cycle and continue through to contract award, to help \nensure a successful procurement \noutcome and achieve optimal value for \nmoney (VFM)2 (see Figure).\n\n1.3 \nThe procedures and \ndocuments used to procure a particular \ncontract through OCB will not be limited \nby prescribed thresholds, methods, or \nbidding documents (Box 1). In general, \nimplementation arrangements for OCB \nwill be derived from a sophisticated \nplanning process that takes into \naccount procurement and market risk \nassessments,3 quality criteria, fitness for \n\nbox 1\nopen Competitive bidding \narrangements are determined \nby\u00a0good Planning\nThe decision on whether and how to \napply OCB, including whether to advertise \nnationally or internationally, is driven by the \nstrategic procurement planning process. \nIt does not depend on preconceived \napproaches or thresholds, but on the \ncontext of the project and the supply \nmarket.\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\n1  Mutual reliance is an agreement between a cofinancier and ADB to rely on each other\u2019s \n\nprocurement principles and procedures. Depending on the circumstances, ADB may accept the \nuse of alternative procurement arrangements.\n\n2  ADB defines VFM as the principle that enables borrowers to obtain optimal benefits through \neffective, efficient, and economic use of resources by applying, as appropriate, the core \nprocurement principles and related considerations. These may include life cycle costs and \nsocioeconomic and environmental development objectives of the borrower. Price alone may not \nsufficiently represent VFM.

OCB will, therefore, improve ADB\u2019s \nresponsiveness to changing or emerging trends, such as the needs of borrowers, \nbest practices in procurement, contracting models and forms, technologies, modes \nof stakeholder engagement, etc. Bidding documents5 may be designed accordingly \n\n4  When the planning process indicates that OCB is not appropriate, other methods of \n\nprocurement may be used as defined in the procurement regulations in Section 2\u2014Procurement \nMethods and Other Arrangements.\nIn this guidance note, references to \u201cbidding document\u201d include requests for proposals used in \nconsulting services, where appropriate to the context.\n\n5 \n\nPROCUREMENTCYCLEFairnessValue forMoneyQualityEfficiencyEconomyTransparencyProject ConceptualizationProcurement Planning Procurement PlanProject Procurement Risk Assessment Project Administration ManualTransaction Technical Assistance Procurement Risk CategorizationBidding DocumentsContract AwardContract Management PlanFeedback or EvaluationImplementation andContract ManagementProject Completion ReportContract Close Lessons LearnedCountry Partnership StrategyCountry and Sector/Agency Procurement Risk AssessmentBid EvaluationEvaluation ReportsBidding\f Introduction\n\n3\n\nbox 2\nopen Competitive bidding is More Flexible than adb\u2019s Previous Methods\nOCB is more than just a renaming of the international competitive bidding and national \ncompetitive bidding methods under the Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time \nto time). OCB also encompasses competitive recruitment methods for consulting servicesa \nand removes conceptual boundaries (for example, the understanding that merit point scoring \nshould not be used in the procurement of goods or civil works) that previously limited the \nflexibility needed to achieve successful procurement and development outcomes. \n\na\u2002Quality- and cost-based selection, quality-based selection, consultants\u2019 qualifications \nselection, fixed budget selection, and least-cost selection.\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\nand ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents (SBDs) may be revised from time to time, \nwith new SBDs added to address evolving strategic needs.\n\nWhen appropriately designed and implemented, OCB mitigates \n\n1.5 \nprocurement and market risks, and achieves VFM and fit-for-purpose \noutcomes, including shaping the market to meet the borrower\u2019s strategic needs. \nIt\u00a0generally includes the following six stages: (i) notification and advertisement, \n(ii)\u00a0prequalification or shortlisting (when appropriate),6 (iii) preparation and \nissuance of the bidding documents, (iv) bid submission and bid opening, (v) bid \nevaluation, and (vi) contract award.7\n\n1.6 \nfollows:\n\nThe key steps to developing and undertaking an OCB procurement are as \n\n(i)  Determine the type and size of the contract, based on the \n\ncircumstances and the various elements of goods, works, and \nservices required under the project, in accordance with the project \nprocurement plan. The Guidance Note on Strategic Procurement \nPlanning has further details on procurement planning and contract \npackaging.\nIdentify and develop the technical requirements, specifications, or \nterms of reference, and define the quality and performance levels to \nbe achieved (section II of this guidance note).\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii)  Develop appropriate evaluation and qualification criteria, depending \non the quality and cost factors to be applied (sections III and IV).\n\n(iv)  Determine the bidding procedures, such as use of two-stage or \n\ntwo-envelope bidding. The Guidance Note on Strategic Procurement \nPlanning provides further details on the available bidding procedures \nand advice on when to use them.\n\n(v)  Prepare the bidding documents (section V).\n\n6  For further information on prequalification, refer to the Guidance Note on Prequalification.\n7  Refer to the Guidance Note on Consulting Services Administered by ADB Borrowers for specific \n\ninformation on procedures for the procurement of consulting contracts using OCB.\n\n\f4\n\nOpen Competitive Bidding\n\n(vi)  Publish the procurement notice, issue the bidding documents, \n\nreceive bids, respond to clarifications and issue amendments (if any), \nand undertake bid opening procedures (section VI).\n\n(vii)  Evaluate the bids received and undertake the contract award \n\nprocedures, including debriefing (section VII).\n\n(viii)  Manage the contract. Further details on the contract management \n\nprocess can be found in the Guidance Note on Contract Management.\n\n\fii.\u2003defining technical requirements \nand Quality and Performance levels\n\n2.1 \ncontracts should adhere to the following principles:8\n\nSpecifications or terms of reference for OCB goods, works, and services \n\n(i)  The specifications should\n\n(a)  define the technical and quality requirements of the contract;\n(b)  be formulated in terms of performance or functional \n\nrequirements, where possible, and define the minimum \nperformance requirements and any warranty and maintenance \nrequirements;\n\n(c)  promote the broadest possible competition, while assuring the \n\ncritical performance or other requirements for the goods, works, \nand/or services under procurement; and\n\n(d)  define the nature and scope of the contract that will be required \n\nto satisfy the needs, quality, and standards to be met.\n\n(ii)  As much as possible, the specified equipment, materials, or \n\ntechniques shall comply with internationally-accepted standards and \ntechnical requirements, such as those issued by the International \nStandards Organization. Where such international standards are \nunavailable or are inappropriate, national standards may be specified. \nIn all cases, the bidding documents shall state that equipment, \nmaterial, or techniques meeting other, substantially equivalent \nstandards will also be accepted.\n\n(iii)  When appropriate, the technical specifications should define any \ntests, standards, and methods that will be employed to assess the \nconformity of equipment as delivered, or the works or services \nprovided.\n\n(iv)  Specifications shall be based on relevant characteristics and/or \n\nperformance requirements and must avoid any references to brand \nnames, catalog numbers, or similar classifications. If it is necessary to \nquote a brand name or catalog number of a particular manufacturer \nto clarify an otherwise incomplete specification, the words \u201cor \nequivalent\u201d must be added after such reference.\n\n(v)  Offers for goods that have similar characteristics and that provide \n\nperformance at least substantially equivalent to those specified shall \nbe accepted.\n\n8 \n\nIn the case of admeasurement works contracts, in addition to the employer\u2019s requirements, \nthese principles also apply to the bill of quantities. \n\n\f6\n\nOpen Competitive Bidding\n\n(vi)  Specifications should be prepared on the basis of, and be consistent \nwith, the form of contract to be used. The respective responsibilities \nof the employer and contractor should be consistently described in \nand between the specification and the contract. The form of contract \nshould not be an afterthought, to avoid risks of incompatibility \nbetween the specification and the contract, or the need to customize \ncontract conditions to fit the specification.\n\n(vii)  Sufficient information to enable bidders and evaluators to determine \n\nif a bidder\u2019s previous contract(s) will meet any qualification \nrequirement for experience in similar contracts should be included.\n\n(viii)  Wherever possible, the range of sizes or values for specific \n\ncomponents should be prepared to fit in the overall performance \nstandards and meet the requirements or purpose of those goods, \nlike\u00a0computers, vehicles, etc. \n\nFurther details on developing technical requirements for OCB are in \n2.2 \nthe Guidance Notes on (i) Quality, (ii) Value for Money, (iii) Consulting Services \nAdministered by ADB Borrowers, and (iv) Nonconsulting Services Administered by \nADB\u00a0Borrowers.\n\n\fiii.\u2003developing Qualification Criteria\n\nThe purpose of qualification criteria for goods, works, and nonconsulting \n\n3.1 \nservice contracts is to ensure that the contract is awarded only to the bidder that \nhas the professional, financial, and technical capacity to successfully perform it. \nThe qualification requirements should be limited to those necessary to establish \nthat a bidder has such capacity. \n\nThe standard text of qualification criteria should be used, unamended, \n3.2 \nfrom ADB\u2019s user\u2019s guides to its SBDs (where available), except to insert contract-\nspecific information following the guidance in the relevant user\u2019s guide.9 \n\n9  Section V of this guidance note has links to the ADB user\u2019s guides to its SBDs.\n\n\fiV.\u2003selecting evaluation Criteria\n\nA.   General Principles\n\nThe evaluation criteria must be carefully chosen to allow the right balance \n\n4.1 \nof price and quality to be assessed, and ensure that VFM will be achieved under \nthe resulting contract. Factors to consider include the type, nature, and value of \nthe procurement; market conditions; complexity; risk; and objective of what is \nbeing procured; as well as socioeconomic or environmental objectives, fitness \nfor purpose, and the bidder\u2019s record of achieving the desired results based on \nexperience and performance history.10 The evaluation criteria must be clearly \nspecified in the bidding documents and describe all factors that will be considered, \nand the methodology by which they will be quantified or evaluated.\n\n4.2 \nIn cases when quality standards of the technical requirements can be \nestablished and measured easily by referring to technical specifications or well-\nestablished industry standards, applying evaluation criteria that consider life cycle \ncosts and the cost to the borrower of nonmaterial commercial and technical \ndeviations will help to achieve VFM. Life cycle costs include costs of operation \nand maintenance, licensing, additional features, consumables, disposal, etc. This \nwill then facilitate the calculation of an evaluated bid price for each bidder. The \ncontract will be awarded to the bidder offering the lowest evaluated cost for goods, \nworks, and services substantially meeting those technical requirements. This will \nbe the case for standard off-the-shelf goods and equipment, standard works, and \nstandard nonconsulting services.\n\nFor certain contracts, however, VFM is more likely to be achieved by \n\n4.3 \napplying evaluation methods that allow for an assessment of the balance between \ncost and quality according to the needs of the borrower as well as the project\u2019s \nintended development objectives. In such cases, the use of nonprice criteria  \n(e.g., point scoring) may be suitable. Such cases may include\n\n(i)  where quality needs to be measured by comparison among bidders, \nbased on an assessment of qualifications, experience, and/or \nperformance;\n\n(ii)  complex solutions consisting of a combination of goods, works, and/or \n\nservices; or\n\n10  The Guidance Note on Consulting Services Administered by ADB Borrowers has further details on \n\nevaluation criteria for OCB consulting assignments.\n\n\fSelecting Evaluation Criteria\n\n99\n\n(iii)  infrastructure, equipment, or services involving proven or high-level \ntechnology that improves the quality of the goods, works, or services \nprovided.\n\nB.  \n\nExcessive Criteria and Requirements \n\nEvaluation criteria (including bidding requirements affecting the awarding \n\n4.4 \nof the contract to a bidder), which are intended to mitigate risks of supplier or \ncontractor nonperformance (rather than addressing technical or commercial \nnonconformities), should not be excessive. For example, excessive bidding or \nevaluation requirements include\n\n(i)  borrower staff visiting the bidders\u2019 manufacturing or reference sites to \n\nassess a bidder\u2019s capacity;\n\n(ii)  bidders being requested to provide samples of goods to assess \n\ncompliance with the technical requirements; or\n\n(iii)  bidders being requested to provide original copies of documents,  \ne.g., original signed contract document as evidence of a previous \nsimilar contract.  \n\nThis reflects that the contract signed with the winning bidder will itself have built-in \nperformance risk mitigations, e.g., contractual provisions that address contractor \nperformance issues, including liquidated or delay damages, performance guarantee, \nadvance payment to the contractor (supported by an advance payment guarantee \nheld by the employer), etc. \n\n4.5 \nIf there is a compelling need for any such requirements, they can \nbe requested or undertaken after the winning bidder has been awarded the \ncontract, before or at the time of contract signing. The nonfulfillment of any such \nrequirement will not affect the awarding of the contract or the contract price. \nContractual provisions are sufficient to address any issues that may become \napparent after the contract has been awarded.\n\n\fV.\u2003Preparing bidding documents\n\n5.1 \nThe use of OCB is supported by a suite of SBDs to promote consistency \nand legal certainty across procurement processes. The specific SBD to be used for \na procurement contract will depend on the (i) nature, complexity, and value of the \ngoods, works, and/or services required; (ii) desired bidding procedures (e.g., single-\nstage or two-stage bidding with one or two envelopes); and (iii) any application \nof alternative procurement arrangements (i.e., procurement rules of the lead \ncofinancier or accredited agency of the borrower). \n\n5.2 \nThe bidding document for a particular contract will be prepared by the \nborrower (through its project executing or implementing agency) and provided \nto prospective bidders who purchase it, or to applicants or firms that have been \nprequalified or shortlisted. Borrowers should refer to the ADB user\u2019s guide relevant \nto the SBD that will be used for the procurement, if ADB\u2019s SBDs are being used \n(Box 3). \n\nbox 3\nadb\u2019s user\u2019s guides to its standard bidding documents\nUser\u2019s guides on different ADB standard bidding documents are available for use for \nprequalification and for the procurement of goods, works, small works, and plant, among \nothers, through the following links on the ADB website:\n\u2022\t ADB. 2018.

Other SBDs may be used where \nan alternative procurement arrangement is applied or where another \ndevelopment partner or accredited agency has an SBD that is suitable \nfor a highly specialized contract. Borrowers may use their local SBDs \nor those of other development partners, provided that such are \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s 2017 procurement regulations.\n\n(iv)  Local language bidding documents with provisions requiring (a) bids \nto be submitted in the local language, (b) bid prices and payment \ncurrency limited to local currency, and/or (c) bid and performance \nsecurity (if used) restricted to local banks or in forms different from \nthose allowed by ADB for international advertising, may be used \nfor those contracts procured using national advertising, provided \nthey are authorized to be used by local procurement laws, rules, and \nregulations deemed acceptable as indicated in the procurement plan.\n(v)  Customized bidding documents may be used where an SBD will not, \nwithout the customizations, satisfy the core procurement principles, \nsubject to ADB\u2019s review and no-objection. \n\nB.  \n\nContent of Bidding Documents\n\nBidding documents define the procedures for bidding and the award of \n\n5.4 \ncontract, and the rights and obligations of the borrower and the bidders throughout \nthat process. While the content of each bidding document will depend on the type, \nvalue, and complexity of the contract, bidding documents will include common \nelements as described in Table 2.\n\n11  The table excludes consulting services, for which requirements are described in the Guidance \nNote on Consulting Services Administered by ADB Borrowers and in ADB\u2019s standard request for \nproposals document.\n\n\f12\n\nOpen Competitive Bidding\n\nTable 1: General Use of Standard Bidding Documents under  \nOpen Competitive Bidding\n\nNationally Advertised OCB Internationally Advertised OCB\n\nType of SBD\n\n\u2022\tADB\u2019s SBDs\n\u2022\tOther development partners\u2019 SBDs\n\u2022\tSBDs of an accredited agency of the borrower\n\u2022\tCustomized bidding documents\n\nLanguage of SBD\n\nNational language and/or \nEnglish\n\nRecommended period for \npreparation of bids\n\nApplication of domestic \npreference\n\n4 weeks\n\nYes\n\nEnglish\n\n6 weeks\n\nYesa\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, OCB = open competitive bidding, SBD = standard bidding \ndocument.\n\na\u2002Where the borrower\u2019s country is eligible for domestic preference as stated in the procurement \nplan.

Notification and Advertisement\n\nIn addition to the publication \n\nbox 4\nComplex Procurements May \nneed Wider advertising\nFor large or specialized contracts, \nadvertisement in well-known technical \nmagazines, trade publications, or \nnewspapers of wide international \ncirculation may also be required to ensure \neffective competition capable of achieving \nthe core procurement principles.\n\n6.2 \nof an advance procurement notice \nand procurement plan on the ADB \nwebsite, advertising for specific \ncontracts (including invitations for \nprequalification) will be carried out \ninternationally or nationally, depending \non the nature, size, and value of the \nprocurement contract, as well as on \nthe prevailing market conditions for the \ngoods, works, and/or services in question \n(Box 4). The project procurement plan \nshall include the mode of advertisement \n(international or national advertising) for each contract package. The following \nprocedures will apply even if the contract is being procured through advance \ncontracting or retroactive financing.\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\n1. \n\ninternational advertisement\n\n6.3 \n\nProcurement contracts using international advertising shall be published \n\n(i)  on the ADB website;12 \n(ii)  on a freely and publicly accessible website in English; and\n\n12  ADB. www.adb.org.\n\n\fAdvertising and Bidding\n\n1515\n\n(iii)  in a newspaper of national circulation (at least in one English language \n\nnewspaper, if available) or website in the borrower\u2019s country. \n\n2. \n\nnational advertisement\n\nWhere the supply market assessment indicates a contract is not amenable \n\n6.4 \nto international competition, the advertisement may be published in the national \npress, gazette, or on a free and publicly accessible website. The advertisement \nmay also be published on the ADB website at the option of the borrower, except \nfor advertisements for consulting services, which must be advertised on the ADB \nwebsite through the Consultant Management System, regardless of whether they \nuse international or national advertising. \n\nB.  \n\nRequirements and Procedures\n\nAn invitation for bids (IFB) \n\n6.5 \nmust provide information to potential \nbidders regarding the borrower (or \nprospective borrower, in cases of \nprocurement action taken in advance of \nADB\u2019s loan or grant approval); amount \nand purpose of the loan or grant; scope \nof procurement under OCB; and the \nname, telephone number, e-mail address, \nand address of the borrower\u2019s executing \nor implementing agency responsible for \nprocurement, and/or the website where \nthe bidding documents can be obtained (Box 5).13\n\nbox 5\nContents of an invitation for bids\n\u2022\t Borrower information: agency name, \naddress, e-mail, contact numbers\n\u2022\t Purpose and amount of loan or grant\n\u2022\t Scope of contract\n\u2022\t Website where the bidding \ndocuments can be obtained\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\nTo further assist potential bidders in deciding whether to purchase or \n\n6.6 \nobtain the bidding documents, the IFB may also include information regarding the \nkey qualification criteria, key criteria for bid evaluation (including the application of \nany domestic preference in bid evaluation), and relevant contractual requirements \nand conditions. \n\nRegardless of the review method for the contract, a copy of the IFB must \n\n6.7 \nbe submitted by the borrower to ADB for review and publication on the ADB \nwebsite. The Guidance Note on Procurement Review has further details on ADB\u2019s \nprior and post review (sampling) arrangements for borrowers\u2019 procurement actions.\n\n6.8 \nThe period from advertisement\u2014i.e., the period from the date of \npublication of the IFB or the date of availability of the bidding documents, \n\n13  This section addresses requirements and procedures for advertising goods, works, and \n\nnonconsulting services procurements through OCB. The Guidance Note on Consulting Services \nAdministered by ADB Borrowers has specific information on the advertising of OCB consulting \nservice contracts.\n\n\f16\n\nOpen Competitive Bidding\n\nwhichever is later\u2014to the date of bid submission must allow bidders sufficient time \nto prepare and submit quality bids. This depends on the nature and complexity \nof the contract. Generally, 6 weeks for internationally advertised contracts and \n4 weeks for nationally advertised contracts will be sufficient. However, a shorter \nor longer period may be appropriate depending on the circumstances of the \nproject, for example: the magnitude and complexity of the contract, the need for \nspecialized technical inputs into bid preparation, the responsiveness of the supply \nmarket, and/or the use of electronic procurement.\n\nC.  \n\nClarifications of and Amendments  \nto the Bidding Documents\n\n6.9 \nRequests for clarification submitted by potential bidders and the \nborrower\u2019s responses shall be made in writing or, where possible, through a secure \nelectronic procurement system.\n\n6.10 \nThe borrower will respond to any request for clarification received no later \nthan the specified period prior to the deadline for bid submission. The borrower will \nforward copies of the request and its response, without disclosing who submitted \nthe request, to all those that have purchased or obtained the bidding documents \nfrom the borrower. \n\nThe borrower may amend the bidding documents by issuing addenda \n\n6.11 \nand, where necessary, extend the deadline for bid submission. The borrower \nmust ensure that all prospective bidders that purchased or obtained the bidding \ndocuments from the borrower are made aware of the amendment(s).\n\nFor complex works, supply, or services contracts, a pre-bid conference \n6.12 \nsupported by a site visit may be arranged so that potential bidders can meet with \nthe borrower\u2019s representatives to seek clarifications (in person or online). Minutes \nof the conference must be provided to all those that have purchased or obtained \nthe bidding documents and, in cases of prior review, a copy shall be sent to ADB.\n\nD.  \n\nBid Opening\n\nThe bid opening will be conducted as described in the bidding documents \n\n6.13 \nand depend on whether the bidding procedure is based on the submission of one \nor two envelopes in one or two stages. Experienced borrower staff or consultants \nshould lead the bid opening process, as mistakes are usually irreversible and \nmay lead to complaints. Appendix 1 of this guidance note summarizes bid \nopening procedures. Further details are described in the ADB 2017 procurement \nregulations, in Appendix 3, paras. 62\u201368.\n\n\fVii.\u2003bid evaluation, Contract award, \nand debriefing\n\nThe award of contract results \n\n7.1 \nfrom a bid evaluation process that \ndetermines the winning bidder by strictly \nfollowing the criteria and methodology \ndescribed in the bidding documents \n(Box 6). Appendixes 2 and 3 describe \ntypical bid evaluation procedures and \ncommon issues encountered during bid \nevaluation.\n\nbox 6\nabnormally low bids\nTo maintain the quality of bids, evaluation \nwill also concern the identification of \nany abnormally low bids. This refers \nto bids whose bid prices appear so \nunreasonably low that it raises concerns \nwith the borrower on the bidder\u2019s ability \nto perform the contract successfully. \nThe Guidance Note on Abnormally Low \nBids provides further details on the \nidentification and assessment of bids that \nappear to be abnormally low.\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\nThe borrower will make its \n\n7.2 \nown arrangements on who undertakes \nthe evaluation and how it is done, e.g., \nby a designated evaluation committee \nor other arrangements, and by the \ncommittee in joint session or by \nindividual evaluations deliberated and put to a committee vote. There must be \nprocedural guarantees (i) against conflicts of interest and (ii) for maintaining the \nconfidentiality of information. ADB strongly recommends that the evaluation \n(and contract award) be completed within the initial period of bid validity, to avoid \nproblems such as bidders not agreeing to extend the validity of their bids. The \nborrower must prepare a detailed report on the evaluation and comparison of bids. \nThe report will specify the basis for recommending that the contract be awarded to \na particular bidder. ADB\u2019s Guide on Bid Evaluation (2018) provides further details \non the bid evaluation process.14\n\n7.3 \nIf an extension of bid validity becomes necessary and is justified, the \nborrower must request such an extension from all bidders in writing before the \nexpiration date. Bidders may not be requested or permitted to change the price or \nother conditions of their bid, but will have the right to refuse the extension. If the \nbidding documents require a bid security, bidders may exercise their right to refuse \nto grant such an extension without forfeiting their bid security.\n\n14  ADB. 2018. Guide on Bid Evaluation. Manila. https://www.adb.org/documents/guide-bid-\n\nevaluation.\n\n\f18\n\nOpen Competitive Bidding\n\nA.  \n\nRole of Evaluators\n\nGood procurement outcomes rely on the borrower\u2019s evaluators having \n\n7.4 \nappropriate skills, and then exercising those skills and their professional judgment \nto evaluate bids against the bidding document. If the borrower does not have \nsufficient technical or financial skills, consultant support should be arranged.\n\nB.  \n\nRole of Bidders\n\nUnder the ADB 2017 procurement regulations, \u201cit is the responsibility of \n7.5 \nthe bidder to raise any issue of ambiguity, contradiction, omission, etc., prior to the \nsubmission of its bid to assure submission of a fully responsive and compliant bid \nthat includes all the supporting documents requested in the bidding documents.\u201d15 \nThis means that a bidder cannot rely on the borrower to identify and allow it to \ncorrect its errors by requesting clarification of ambiguities or missing documents \nduring the evaluation process. While there is scope for the borrower to request \nclarifications or missing documents without affecting the substance of the bid or \ntransparency of the bidding process, the borrower is under no obligation to do so.\n\nC.  \n\nPostqualification Procedure\n\nIn cases where prequalification was not carried out, the borrower \n\n7.6 \nmust determine if the recommended bidder has the capability and resources to \neffectively carry out the goods, works, or nonconsulting services contract offered \nin the bid. The bidding document contains criteria to be satisfied. The borrower \nshould especially scrutinize the successful bidder\u2019s eligibility, including checking \nthe ADB sanctions list (for all bidders) and its pending litigation, rather than relying \non disclosures of such information in the submitted bidding forms. If the bidder \ndoes not fulfill those criteria, the bid must be rejected and the borrower will need to \nmake a similar determination for the next-ranked bidder. In a single-stage, two-\nenvelope bidding process, all bidders will be subjected to postqualification.\n\nThe contract is awarded to the bidder who meets the appropriate \n\n7.7 \nstandards of capability and whose bid has been determined to be substantially \nresponsive to the bidding documents and to offer either (i) the lowest evaluated \ncost or (ii) the best combination of quality and price, as appropriate and according \nto contract type, based on the criteria identified in the bidding documents, \nincluding life cycle costs, wherever applicable.\n\n15  ADB. 2017.

Domestic Preference\n\nWhere ADB has accepted provisions that promote or encourage the \n\n7.8 \ndevelopment of domestic industry through domestic preference schemes, these \nwill be applied at the evaluation stage. This may be done only in accordance with a \nscheme that has been identified in the procurement plan.\n\nE.   Notification Requirements\n\nOnce the borrower has selected the successful bidder for an internationally \n\n7.9 \nor nationally advertised contract, it will undertake the following tasks (i) within \n2\u00a0weeks of that decision; (ii) after expiry of the standstill period, where such period \napplies; or, (iii) upon receipt of ADB\u2019s confirmation of satisfactory resolution of the \ncomplaint, if a complaint has been filed within the standstill period:\n\ntransmit a notice of award to the successful bidder; and\n\n(i) \n(ii)  publish the results, identifying the bid and lot or package numbers as \napplicable, in an English language newspaper or widely known and \nfreely accessible website. \n\n7.10 \n\nThe publication of the results should contain the following information:\n\nthe name of each bidder;\n\n(i) \n(ii)  the bid prices as read out at bid opening;\n(iii)  the name and evaluated prices or appropriate scores of each bid that \n\nwas evaluated;\n\ntheir rejection; and\n\n(iv)  the name of bidders whose bids were rejected and the reasons for \n\n(v)  the name of the winning bidder, and the price it offered or score it \n\nachieved, as well as the duration and summary scope of the contract \nawarded. \n\nWhen funding projects, ADB \n7.11 \nmay accept the application of national \nstandstill provisions or those of another \ndevelopment partner (Box 7). Where \nstandstill provisions apply, the borrower \nshall, before issuing any notice of award \nof contract, send to each unsuccessful \nbidder a written notification of (i) the \nborrower\u2019s intention to award a contract \nto the successful bidder at the end of \nthe designated standstill period; and \n(ii) the details described in Appendix \n3, para. 87, of the 2017 procurement \n\nbox 7\nstandstill Periods\nA standstill period suspends the \nprocurement procedure for a specified \ntime (usually 10 working days) between \nthe point at which the intention to award \nthe contract is formulated and when the \ncontract is actually awarded. It is generally \nused to provide unsuccessful bidders with \na period within which they can challenge \nthe proposed award to allow for the timely \nfiling and resolution of any complaints.\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\n\f20\n\nOpen Competitive Bidding\n\nregulations. The Guidance Note on Standstill Period provides further details on the \nuse of standstill periods in ADB operations.\n\nF.  \n\nDebriefing\n\nWhere standstill provisions do not apply, the borrower will specify in the \n\n7.12 \nnotification of contract award that any bidder who wishes to ascertain the grounds \non which its bid was not selected should request an explanation from the borrower. \nThe borrower shall promptly, in writing and/or in a debriefing meeting, provide an \nexplanation of why the bid was not selected.\n\nWhere a standstill provision applies, debriefing shall take place within that \n\n7.13 \nperiod. The borrower\u2019s failure to provide a debriefing within the standstill period \nwill normally (depending on the national provisions) have the effect of extending \nthe end of the standstill period until a debriefing is conducted. If the bidder is not \nsatisfied with the explanation from the borrower, the bidder may write directly to \nADB.

For example:\n\n(i)  audited financial statements (AFS) may mention legal disputes, even \nthough the bidder states elsewhere in its bid that it has no pending \nlitigation or arbitration, or mention ongoing contracts or projects that \nare not included in the bidder\u2019s current contractual commitments;\n\n(ii)  a bidder may submit consolidated AFS for a group of companies, of \nwhich the bidder is one of those companies, such that the bidder\u2019s \nfinancial capacity will be overstated if consolidated figures are used by \nthe borrower to evaluate the bid;\n\n(iii)  a bidder may insert figures in its bidding forms that are inconsistent \n\nwith figures in its AFS; and\n\n(iv)  a bidder may use figures from its AFS for total turnover rather than \njust its construction turnover in calculating its annual construction \nturnover.  \n\nA3.2 \nThe financial information provided by the bidder should be reviewed in \nits entirety to allow a truly informed judgment, and the pass or fail decision on the \nfinancial position of the bidder should be given on this basis. Any abnormal features \nthat may lead to financial problems should alert the borrower to seek expert \nprofessional advice for further review and interpretation.\n\n\f24\n\nAppendix 3\n\nB.  \n\nEvaluation of Bids Against the \u201cContracts of  \nSimilar Size and Nature\u201d Criterion\n\n1. \n\nexperience as a Main Contractor versus as a subcontractor\n\nA3.3 \ncontracts, for example:\n\nBidders may be understood as having different roles in their previous \n\n(i)  as the \u201cgeneral contractor,\u201d\n(ii)  as the \u201cmain contractor,\u201d or\n(iii)  as a \u201csubcontractor.\u201d \n\nThese roles involve different degrees of project management and \n\nA3.4 \nactual construction of the works, and may vary from one contract to the next. \nFor this reason, it is necessary to look beyond a broad classification of a bidder\u2019s \nrole as a general or main contractor, or subcontractor and, instead, to focus on \nthe substance of the bidder\u2019s participation in a previous contract, in assessing \nits similarity to the contract being procured. The assessment should consider \nthe bidder\u2019s explanation of the similarity of its previous contract, in the relevant \nbidding\u00a0form.\n\nTherefore, it is possible that, in the same bidding process, two bidders will \n\nA3.5 \noffer the same previous contract to support their qualification for the \u201cContracts \nof Similar Size and Nature\u201d criterion. One bidder may have performed the role of \nthe main contractor and the other bidder may have been the subcontractor that \nconstructed the actual works. The bidders may also claim both a percentage of the \ncontract that exceeds 50% each and/or exceeds 100% of the contract in total. In \nprinciple, this is acceptable: the bidders have different, but overlapping roles, each \nof which may demonstrate that the bidder has sufficient capacity to implement the \ncontract to be procured. \n\n2. \n\nthe Meaning of \u201csubstantially Completed\u201d\n\nEvaluators should exercise their professional judgment, taking into \n\nA3.6 \naccount the nature and complexity of a bidder\u2019s uncompleted previous contract, \nin assessing if it has been \u201csubstantially completed.\u201d The assessment will largely \ndepend on the nature or type of contract. For example, substantial completion of \nworks of a repetitive or contiguous nature, such as the construction of a road, will \nbe different from substantial completion of a turnkey contract for the construction \nof a facility, such as a water treatment plant.\n\nUse of an arbitrary percentage of physical progress or of the value of the \n\nA3.7 \ncontract that has been completed or disbursed can lead to poor procurement \noutcomes. For example, a bidder may meet the arbitrary requirement, but not \nhave actual technical capacity, potentially leading to the bidder being awarded the \ncontract, but not being able to successfully implement it. Alternatively, a bidder \n\n\fAppendix 3\n\n25\n\nmay have derived adequate technical capacity from its uncompleted contract, \nbut not be able to meet the arbitrary requirement, thereby leading to the bidder\u2019s \nrejection and a weakening of competition.\n\n3. \n\nevidence of bidder\u2019s Past Contracts\n\nBidders may be required to provide evidence of their experience, including \n\nA3.8 \nsuccessful past performance. In addition, evaluators may conduct their own due \ndiligence, for example, from the employer of a bidder\u2019s previous contract. When \nevaluators have obtained information from a third party that does not support \nor favor the bidder, the information needs to be formally introduced into the \nevaluation through a request for clarification to the bidder, to give the bidder the \nopportunity to respond to the adverse information. \n\nIf the evaluators are concerned that supporting documents provided \n\nA3.9 \nby a bidder are not genuine, the bidder may be requested to arrange reasonable \nattestation or certification to prove their authenticity. A bid cannot be rejected \ndue to failure of a bidder to provide an original version of a document, e.g., a signed \ncontract. If the borrower has a compelling need to see an original version of any \ndocument supplied by the winning bidder, it can be requested after the winning \nbidder has been awarded the contract, e.g., before or at the time of contract signing.\n\n\fOpen Competitive Bidding\nGuidance Note on Procurement\n\nWith open competition a key principle in ADB operations, open competitive bidding is \nADB\u2019s preferred procurement method. It consolidates the competitive procurement of \ngoods, works, and services under a single procurement method. This method facilitates \nopen competition among all eligible bidders, regardless of whether procurement \ncontracts are advertised internationally or nationally. Its defining feature is effective \nand appropriate advertising to provide as many qualified bidders as possible equal \nopportunity to bid for contracts. This guidance note advises borrowers on best \npractices in implementing this method for projects financed in whole or in part by an \nADB loan or grant, or by ADB-administered funds.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its \ndeveloping member countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their \npeople. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to a large share of the \nworld\u2019s poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic \ngrowth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, \nequity investments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\n\nasian deVeloPMent bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["OPEN COMPETITIVE \nBIDDING\nGUIDANCE NOTE ON PROCUREMENT\n", "JUNE 2018\n", "ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n", "   Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0  \n  IGO license (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 IGO) \n", "\u00a9 2018 Asian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City, 1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nTel +63 2 632 4444; Fax +63 2 636 2444\nwww.adb.org\n", "Some rights reserved.
