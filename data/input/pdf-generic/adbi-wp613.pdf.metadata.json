In  1996,  the  first  State  Budget  Law  was  promulgated,  and  fiscal \ndecentralization was formally mandated. This law was then revised in 2002 and put into \noperation  in  2004,  giving  more  autonomy  to  local  governments,  especially  at  the \nprovincial level to promote sustainable development underpinned by local preferences \nand  economic  stability,  equity  across  provinces,  efficient  services  delivery,  and \nenhanced transparency and accountability in public finances.  \nToday, local spending accounts for just over one-half of general government spending, \nwhile local revenue accounts for over one-third of general government revenue, and \njust over one-half when extrabudgetary sources are included. These are significant \nshares  when  compared  to  other  countries,  particularly  those  at  a  similar  level  of \ndevelopment to Viet Nam (World Bank 2014). \nThis study has two objectives: (i) to take stock of the current institutional framework for \nintergovernmental fiscal relations, and (ii) to empirically assess the deficit sustainability \nof local governments in Viet Nam. \n1.  LOCAL GOVERNMENT SYSTEM AND FISCAL \nDECENTRALIZATION IN VIET NAM SINCE 1975 \n1.1  Local Government System \nViet Nam\u2019s local government system was established in 1945, at the same time as the \nDemocratic  Republic  of  Viet  Nam,  operating  under  the  principle  of  democratic \ncentralism.  This  principle  created  a  hierarchical  top-down  administrative  system, \nmeaning that subordinates obey superiors, and local governments obey the central \ngovernment. Today, Viet Nam has four tiers of government: (i) central; (ii) 63 provinces, \nincluding 5 major cities; (iii) 710 district-level cities, towns (in urban areas), and districts \n(in rural areas); and (iv) 11,145 wards and townships (in urban areas) and communes \n(in rural areas). Each tier of government has both legislative and executive authorities. \nAt  the  central  level,  legislative  authority  rests  with  the  National  Assembly,  and \nexecutive authority rests with line ministries and agencies. At the local level, each tier \nof government has a people\u2019s council to exercise legislative authority and a people\u2019s \ncommittee and line departments to exercise executive authority. \n1.2  Fiscal Decentralization since 1975 \nFrom 1975 to 1989, Viet Nam remained a centralized fiscal and economic system. \nLocal governments acted as an agency for the central government, and they also  \nwere  assigned  some  limited  own-source  revenue  including  fees,  charges,  asset \ndepreciation, some shared revenue including revenue from the profit of state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs), and taxes on agriculture and industrial activities. In 1983, the \ngovernment issued a resolution to further clarify local government own-source revenue \nand revenue shared by local governments with the central government. Sharing rates \nwere still determined by the central government. The central government also designed \na subsidy scheme for provinces that were unable to cover their local expenditures with \nown-source and shared revenues.  \n \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 613  Morgan and Long \n \nDuring this period, the role played by local governments in the budget-making process \ngrew,  and  the  central  government  began  considering  local  governments  to  be  \nan integral component of the state budget. In 1989, the government implemented a \nresolution  that  regulated  the  spending  responsibilities  of  and  revenue  sources  for  \nlocal governments. Under this resolution, local government revenue came from three \ndifferent  sources:  (i)  100%  of  locally  collected  revenue  (e.g.,  collections  to  cover \ndepreciation,  taxes  on  the  slaughter  of  livestock,  and  various  fees  and  charges); \n(ii) shared tax revenue with the central government (e.g., revenue from profits of central \nand  local  SOEs  and  industrial  activities);  and  (iii)  conditional  transfers  to  balance  \nlocal  governments\u2019  budgets.  Under  this  new  arrangement,  shared  revenue  could  \nnot be retained by local governments; thus, of 44 provinces, 14 returned additional \nrevenue to the central government from shared revenue because their local budgets \nwere balanced.  \nIn 1996, to further reform the central\u2013local government relationship, the first budget  \nlaw  was  promulgated, coming  into  effect  in  1997. This  law  outlined  the  spending \nresponsibility and revenue allocations for central and local governments, and regulated \nthe borrowing of local governments and intragovernment fiscal transfers. This law was \nthen revised in 1998, coming into effect in 1999. Under the revised law, the lower tiers \nof local government (i.e., district and commune levels) were assured greater revenue \nand expenditure responsibilities. For example, they were to secure at least 70% of their \nrevenue from taxes on the rights of land transfer, land and housing taxes, licensing \ntaxes from small businesses, and agriculture taxes. This law also defined the roles of \ndifferent agencies engaged in the preparation of the central budget as well as the roles \nof line ministries and local governments in implementation.  \nTo give more fiscal responsibility to local governments, especially at the provincial \nlevel, the new budget law was promulgated in 2002, taking effect in 2004.1 This law \nhas several distinguishing features: \n(i)  The central government has given local governments more autonomy. While \nthe  1997  law  established  intergovernmental  fiscal  relationships  among  all  \ntiers of government, the new law only regulates the fiscal relations between  \nthe  central  and  provincial  levels.  Local  governments  now  have  autonomy  \nin  deciding  the  fiscal  relationship  among  government  levels  within  their \njurisdictions. \n(ii)  The fiscal capacity of local governments has been strengthened. The central \ngovernment now shares some types of revenues that used to be solely central \ngovernment revenue sources (e.g., special consumption taxes, and gasoline \nand oil taxes) with local governments. \n(iii)  The central government also has designed some incentives for revenue efforts \nmade by local governments.  \n(iv)  The  central  government  has  also  established  a  legal  foundation  for  the \nadoption of formula-based intergovernmental fiscal transfers.  \n(v)  It established budget stabilization periods of 3\u20135 years as determined by the \nNational  Assembly.  Since  2004,  there  have  been  three  stability  periods:  \n2004\u20132006, 2007\u20132010, and 2011\u20132016.  \n                                                \n1  Different  from  many  other  economies,  the  budget  law  in  Viet  Nam  not  only  covers  the  central \ngovernment  budget  but  also  that  of  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations,  and  subnational  budget \nmanagement  arrangements,  which  are  usually  treated  separately  in  decentralization  and  local \ngovernment laws. This feature reflects the country\u2019s nested budget system (World Bank 2014). \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 613  Morgan and Long \n \nThe new budget law specifies that there is a single, unified public sector budget that \nmust  ultimately  be  ratified  by  the  National  Assembly,  implying  that  the  National \nAssembly is given more power in the fiscal decentralization process. The transfer norm \ndecision was also moved from the Ministry of Finance to the National Assembly, and is \nmade public to sector ministries and provinces, thus improving the transparency and \nbudget process. Moreover, the National Assembly approves not only estimates of total \nrevenues and expenditures but also their composition.  \nFigure 1: Fiscal Process in Viet Nam \n \nSource: World Bank (2014).  \nDifferent from other countries, the hierarchical nature of the Viet Nam fiscal system \ncomplicates the budget-making process. Although each local government has some \nautonomy in estimating its budget, budgets of lower-level governments are examined \nand approved by the higher level of government. Eventually, the outcomes of the entire \nprocess must be integrated into the single state budget. This hierarchical nature also \nundermines the autonomy of the lower level of governments, as their budgets are \nhighly subject to changes and revision requests by higher levels of governments.  \n1.3  Modern Fiscal Decentralization in Viet Nam \n1.3.1  Expenditure Decentralization \nSince the new budget law, local authorities have been given more power in making \ndecisions relating to resources allocation within their provinces, as the law defines \nspending functions for the central government and local governments. The central \ngovernment still has the exclusive responsibility for external relations, foreign trade and \nforeign assistance, food safety, and drug regulation. Responsibility for all other public \nservices is shared among the various tiers of governments.  \nExpenditure assignments also take into account the special character of provinces  \nand are asymmetric across provinces. Fiscally advantaged provinces enjoy greater \nfiscal and administrative autonomy, while central government agencies have a more \nexpansive role in fiscally disadvantaged provinces. \n   \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 613  Morgan and Long \n \nTable 1: Ratio of Decentralized Revenue to Total Expenditure \n(%) \nExpenditure  2007  2010  2013 \nTotal expenditure  46.6  53.1  52.6 \nDevelopment investment expenditures (including capital expenditure)  62.7  73.4  68.9 \nDebt services and overseas aid  15.2  9.7  6.3 \nRecurrent expenditure  50.3  53.5  53.7 \nEducation  86.2  89.6  90.9 \nHealth  79.0  80.8  84.4 \nSocial welfare  14.0  17.9  24.5 \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations using Ministry of Finance data.  \nLocal  government  spending  makes  up  an  important  share  of  total  government \nexpenditure in Viet Nam (Table 1). The share of local government spending increased \nfrom 47% in 2007 to about 53% in 2013. In 2013, local governments made up about \n70% of total capital spending, since the central government\u2019s responsibility was limited \nto large national projects. Their share in recurrent expenditure also increased to about \n54% in 2013. Except for social security functions, which still accounts for a large share \nof  central  government  spending  (about  75%),  local  governments\u2019  share  of  total \nrecurrent spending in other government functions was high. For example, in 2013, local \ngovernments were responsible for 91% of total recurrent expenditure in the education \nsector and 84% in the health sector.2  \nAt the lower levels of local government, the degree of decentralization is rather high. In \nmany provinces, district spending constituted more than 45% of total local spending \n(World Bank 2014). Lower-level local governments were responsible for most of the \nrecurrent expenditure in the education sector (75% in 2012) and health sector (60% in \n2012). Uchimura and Kono (2012) and the World Bank (2014) found that the shares of \nrural population and the level of local capacity in provinces are important factors in \nexplaining the level of district expenditure in local expenditure. However, the degree of \ncapital expenditure decentralization between the provincial level and lower levels is \nrather limited. Only 30% of provincial total capital expenditure was implemented by the \nlower levels of government. This could be attributed to some concerns over efficiencies \nregarding capital spending at the lower levels.  \nAlthough Viet Nam has accelerated its fiscal decentralization process, there are some \ninstitutional  factors  that  may  have  negative  effects  on  the  effectiveness  of  such \ndecisions. First, the spending responsibilities for each level of government are still not \nclearly  defined,  thus  creating  unnecessary  overlaps.  Except  for  some  exclusive \nresponsibilities as previously mentioned, responsibility for all other public services is \nshared between the central and provincial governments, including national defense and \nsocial  insurance  and  protection. While  the  local  contributions  for  these  areas  are \ntypically small, they disproportionately affect poorer provinces, and sometimes these \nexpenses cannot be anticipated and therefore require diverting local resources from \nother services (World Bank 2014).  \nMoreover,  if  coordination  among  tiers  of  government  is  not  smooth,  ambiguous \nexpenditure  assignments  may  cause  overlaps  and  inefficiency.  The  most  visible \noverlaps are seen in the education and health sectors. For example, in the education \nsector,  the  central  government  and  local  governments  co-share  administering, \n                                                \n2  Viet Nam\u2019s data do not distinguish capital expenditure for the education and health sectors, so data on \neducation and health expenditures are included in recurrent spending (World Bank 2014). \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 613  Morgan and Long \n \nfinancing,  managing,  and  delivering  almost  all  levels  of  education,  from  pre-\nkindergarten  to  university.  Such  overlaps  in  expenditure  responsibilities  create  a \nnumber of burdens for local government, including time and efforts to clarify respective \nfunctions for each level (World Bank 2014).  \nSecond, although the new budget law lists spending functions for both the central and \nlocal governments, the lists are both overdetailed and vague, impacting the autonomy \nand flexibility of local governments. For example, they list some ambiguous functions \nlike investment in SOEs, state economic organizations, and state financial institutions, \nbut spending functions in certain areas may be different among provinces due to \nsocioeconomic development conditions. \nThird,  the  new  budget  law  gives  provinces  autonomy  to  assign  expenditure \nresponsibilities to lower tiers of governments, which leads to substantial heterogeneity \nin provinces\u2019 expenditure assignments. In the first stability period, all three subnational \ngovernments  were  responsible  for  health  care  in  25  provinces,  provincial  and \ncommunal governments shared the responsibility in eight provinces, provincial and \ndistrict governments shared the service responsibility in 14, and the service was the \nexclusive responsibility of the provincial government in 17 provinces (Le 2006). \n1.3.2  Revenue Decentralization  \nRevenue  collected  in  Viet  Nam  can  be  grouped  into  three  categories:  (i)  central \ngovernment  revenue,  (ii)  revenue  entirely  retained  by  local  governments,  and \n(iii) revenue  shared  between  the  central  government  and  local  governments. \nAccordingly, shared taxes include value-added tax (VAT) (except the VAT on imported \ngoods), corporate income tax (except some special cases), personal income taxes, \ntaxes  on  profits  remitted  abroad  (except  for  the  petroleum  industry),  special \nconsumption taxes, and gasoline and oil fees. Note that the sharing of these taxes is \nbased on the domicile of the taxpayer, and tax rates and bases are set by the central \ngovernment and are uniform throughout the country.  \nThe sharing rate has some special features, including a new rate introduced at the \nbeginning of each stabilization period, a uniform rate for all shared taxes, a fixed rate \nduring a stability period, and different rates applied in different provinces. The sharing \nrates are established at the beginning of each stabilization period and are based upon \nprovincial fiscal capacity. Table 2 presents the sharing rates of provinces that had rates \nof less than 100%.  \nTaxes and fees fully dedicated to provinces include taxes on land and housing, natural \nresources (excluding petroleum), license taxes, taxes on transfer of land-use rights, \ntaxes on the use of agriculture land, fees on land use, land rent, revenue from leasing \nand sale of houses owned by the state, registration fees, and revenue from state-run \nlotteries, as well as various fees and charges. Of all of the revenue sources, this type of \nrevenue is the most suitable type of own-source revenue in the standard language of \nfiscal decentralization. This revenue source, together with shared revenues that can be \nviewed as fiscal transfers, makes up decentralized revenue. They represent the core of \nthe locally collected revenue.  \nThe new budget law also allows provincial governments to design their own revenue \nassignments to districts and communes within their jurisdictions, although there are still \nsome  general  principles  and  minimum  standards  that  the  provinces  must  follow. \nHowever, more autonomy in assigning expenditure responsibilities enable provinces to \ndelineate expenditure responsibilities based upon the fiscal capacity and rural and \nurban characteristics of local governments.  \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 613  Morgan and Long \n \nTable 2: Portion of Shared Provincial and Central Government  \nRevenues Retained by Provinces  \n(%) \nProvince  2004\u20132006  2007\u20132010  2011\u20132015 \nHanoi  32  31  42 \nQuang Ninh  98  76  70 \nHai Phong  95  90  88 \nVinh Phuc  86  67  60 \nBac Ninh  100  100  93 \nKhanh Hoa  52  53  77 \nHo Chi Minh City  29  26  23 \nDong Nai  49  45  51 \nBinh Duong  44  40  44 \nBa Ria\u2013Vung Tau  42  46  44 \nLong An  99  100  100 \nTien Giang  99  100  100 \nVinh Long  90  100  100 \nCan Tho  95  95  91 \nOthers  100  100  100 \nSource: Authors\u2019 compilation from Ministry of Finance data. \nThe law also includes an incentive for revenue collection at the local government level. \nA local government can retain up to 30% of all shared revenue actually collected in \nexcess of the estimated amount. Further, to avoid the temptation to underestimate \nfuture shared tax revenues, the law stipulates that the excess amount retained must \nnot exceed the difference between this year\u2019s actual revenue in shared taxes and  \nlast year\u2019s.  \nDuring  2006\u20132012,  decentralized  revenue  in  Viet  Nam  constituted  about  9.6%  of  \ngross domestic product (GDP). Decentralized revenue, however, did not account for a \nlarge share of local economies in Viet Nam. In most of the provinces, decentralized \nrevenue was equal to about 7.0% of local GDP; these provinces also retained 100% of \nthe shared revenue that they collect. This is because some of the most potential \nsources of revenue, such as trade-related revenue, petroleum-related revenue, and \ncorporate income taxes from large SOEs, accrue to the central government and not to \nlocal governments.3  \nFigure 2 presents the contribution of decentralized revenue to total revenue at the  \nlocal  government  level.  The  share  of  revenue  that  is  fully  dedicated  to  provinces  \n(i.e., own-source revenue) declined from 24.3% in 2004 to 12.6% in 2007 and further to \n9.0% in 2013.4 The share of own-source revenue and shared tax revenue also declined \nfrom 44.8% in 2004 to 30.8% in 2007, yet the share of these two sources of revenue \nwas stable at about 30.0% of total revenue during 2007\u20132012. This implies a declining \nrole  of  decentralized  revenue  in  total  local  government  revenues.  Figure  2  also \nindicates a huge gap in the importance of these two sources between provinces with a \n                                                \n3  In 2011, despite the declining trend, trade and petroleum-related revenues are still equal to 8% of \nnational GDP. Similarly, corporate income tax from unified accounting firms is equal to 7% of GDP \n(World Bank 2014). \n4  Compared  to  other  Asian  economies,  this  share  of  this  own-source  revenue  is  similar  (World  \nBank 2014). \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 613  Morgan and Long \n \nsharing rate of 100% and provinces with a sharing rate of less than 100%. In 2013, \nabout 60% of total revenue of better-off provinces was from these two sources, while \nthis figure was about 25% in poorer ones. \nFigure 2: Share of Decentralized Revenue in Total Local Government Revenue \n(%) \n \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations using Ministry of Finance data. \nDespite efforts to give more power to local governments to raise their revenue, several \nobstacles continue to limit the size of local government own-source revenue. First, \nthere are two concerns about the shared revenues. On one hand, the sharing rate  \nis set to take into account differences in fiscal capacity. However, in reality, sharing \nrates  are  determined  through  negotiations  between  central  and  local  government \nauthorities, and thus could lead to suboptimal outcomes due to poor revenue forecasts \nand differing negotiating capacity (World Bank 2014). The other concern relates to  \nthe fairness of the system. The shared revenues in Viet Nam are split, based on where \nrevenues  are  actually  collected  rather  than  where  the  tax  is  incurred.  This  raise \nquestions concerning the fairness of the system, especially for the VAT and corporate \nincome  tax  (e.g.,  if  a  firm  operates  in  one  province,  and  its  headquarters  are  in  \nanother province). \nSecond, some regulations hinder the autonomy that the central government gives to \nprovincial authorities. For example, with regard to fees and user charges, provincial \nauthorities can only set the charges and fees for 19 of 63 items, while the Ministry of \nFinance has the authority to set the fees and user charges of the remaining items. This \npartly explains why only about 11% of own-source revenues were collected from fees \nand charges (World Bank 2014). Another regulation is related to the share of resources \nallocated to the commune level: (i) communes and townships receive at least 70% of \nrevenues from a tax on transfer of land-use rights, land and housing taxes, the license \ntax  on  individuals  and  individual  households,  and  registration  fees  for  land  and \nhousing; and (ii) townships and cities receive at least 50% of revenues from registration \nfees, excluding registration fees for land and housing. Such sources of revenue cannot \nbe  reallocated  among  communes,  which  has  caused  vertical  imbalances  among \ncommunes. While many communes and townships cannot absorb the minimum stated \nshares of resources, other communes cannot raise adequate resources to meet their \nspending needs. This can lead to inefficient spending or regular carryovers in surplus \njurisdictions, and poorer services delivery in deficit jurisdictions (World Bank 2014). \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 613  Morgan and Long \n \nThird,  the  lack  of  minimum  standard  guidelines  for  services  provision  leads  to \nheterogeneity in responsibility sharing across provinces. For example, some provincial \ngovernments retain all revenue from taxes on natural resources, while subprovincial \ngovernments (i.e., districts and communes) in other provinces are fully or partly entitled \nto this tax, depending on business ownership. Sharing rates of a revenue source may \neven vary among districts within a province. For example, in 2008, the sharing rates  \nfor land and house registration fees ranged from 13% to 38% among 24 districts in  \nHo Chi Minh City.  \n1.4  Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfers \nWhile  revenue-sharing  arrangements  help  reduce  vertical  fiscal  imbalances, \nintragovernment  fiscal  transfers  aim  to  reduce  horizontal  fiscal  imbalances  and  to \nachieve national targets and objectives. At the lower levels of government, revenue \nsharing and transfers are also used to address vertical and horizontal imbalances \nacross districts. There are two types of transfer program in Viet Nam: unconditional \nbalancing transfers and targeted transfers.  \nViet  Nam  currently  adopts  two  formulas  to  calculate  balancing  transfers,  one  to \ncalculate  recurrent  spending  needs  and  one  to  estimate  capital  spending  needs.  \nThe formulas are based on transfer norms, which are assigned based on particular \ncriteria, including population, development, geographic area, and number of district \nadministrative units. After subtracting the decentralized revenues (including shared \nrevenues), the remaining amount is covered by the balancing transfer. Because such \nformulas are determined before each stability period,5 balancing transfers are highly \npredictable, as they are fixed in nominal terms over each stability period. \nAt the provincial level, there are allocation norms for spending estimates for districts \nacross 19 categories of expenditure, mostly various functional areas of spending such \nas education, health, and economic services. For each functional area, a per capita \nallocation norm is based on geographic location (e.g., urban, plain areas, mountainous \nareas, and highlands and islands).6  \nTable 3 presents the share of each revenue source in total expenditure. On average, \nthere has been no significant change in the role of each source of revenue in total \nexpenditure,  except  for  the  other  sources  (including  local  government  borrowing). \nDecentralized  revenue  (including  own-source  revenue  and  share  revenue)  still \naccounts  for  65%  of  total  expenditure,  while  total  transfers  (including  balancing \ntransfers and targeted transfers) account for about 40% of total expenditure, implying \nthe increasing importance of shared revenues in local government revenue given the \ndecline in the share of own-source revenue in total local government revenue. \n   \n                                                \n5  In the second stability period, per capita norms were assigned in 14 sectors. The norms took into \naccount the geographic locations of the population within a province. Higher norms were established for \nthose living in remote or mountainous areas, and even higher ones were created for those who live in \nthe highlands or on islands to take into account the input price differences, economies of scale, and \nnumber of vulnerable populations. \n6  For example, for the health sector, urban areas are allocated VND105,600 per person per year, \nwhereas mountainous areas are allocated VND1,986,880 person per year. This recognizes different \ncosts of services delivery across different geographic areas. \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 613  Morgan and Long \n \nTable 3: Source of Revenue for Expenditure \n(%) \nDecentralized Revenue/  Balancing/Total  Transfer/Total  Other \nTotal Expenditure  Expenditure  Expenditure  Sources \nAll pro vinces \n2007  65  22  21  27 \n2010  64  15  24  44 \n2013  66  23  18  37 \nPoorer provinces \n2010  31  19  28  7 \n2013  29  29  20  2 \nNote: Decentralized revenue includes the own-source revenues and shared revenue. \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation using Ministry of Finance data. \nThere is a wide gap in the role of each revenue source in expenditure between better-\noff provinces and poorer ones. In poorer provinces, total transfers still account for \nabout 50% total expenditure, while decentralized revenue makes up only 30%. Table 3 \nshows that while better-off provinces have a large fiscal surplus (i.e., their revenue is \nalways much higher than their expenditure), poorer provinces do not have enough \nresources for their spending, even after receiving intergovernmental transfers. This \ngreatly increases the pressure on these provinces to run budget deficits.  \nFigure 3: Budget Deficits over Time and the Role of Fiscal Transfers \n \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations using Ministry of Finance data. \n9 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 613  Morgan and Long \n \nFigure 3 presents fiscal gaps among provinces. Before transfers, budget deficits seem \nto widen over time. Deficits seem, however, to be driven by budget deficits in poorer \nprovinces where the revenue per capital is much lower than the expenditure per capita \nand  the  growth  of  expenditure  per  capital  is  higher  than  that  of  revenue  per \nexpenditure. After transfers, on average, there is a slight fiscal surplus. In poorer \nprovinces,  fiscal  deficits,  however,  are  still  observed,  indicating  a  growing  vertical \nimbalance across provinces. In 2012, more than 58% of provinces that had 100% \nretained revenue could only finance less than 20% of decentralized expenditure, while \nthe corresponding figure for 2007 was about 46%. This is due in part to the rise in \nspending responsibilities assigned to local authorities and inelasticity of 100% retained \nrevenue with respect to nominal GDP (World Bank 2014).  \nAt the lower levels of government, imbalances are more severe within provinces than \nacross provinces. In many provinces, by the end of 2011, more than 75% of district \nexpenditure  was  covered  by  other  sources  of  finance  rather  than  100%  retained \nrevenue.  Similarly,  in many  districts,  less than  12%  of  district  core spending  was \ncovered by 100% retained revenue in 2011, while this figure was around 20% in 2006. \nThis is partly due to an increase in spending responsibility decentralization (World \nBank 2014). \nThe  system  of  central  targeted  transfers  to  local  authorities  is  conditional  grants \nthrough which the central government aims to achieve socioeconomic development \ntargets. There are two types of target programs: national target programs (NTPs) and \nother target transfers (i.e., conditional transfers). \nNTPs  aim  to  accelerate  progress  toward  national  sociodevelopment  objectives, \ncovering a wide range of objectives aimed at poverty, education, health, livelihoods, \nrural development, culture, energy use, and climate change. The Ministry of Finance \nand  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment  have  overall  responsibility  for  financing \ndecisions and monitoring across all NTPs. Line ministries, which are assigned key \nroles in developing NTPs, are responsible for budget allocations to and oversight of \nNTPs. Various line ministries may also be involved if NTPs cover more than one \nsector. Currently, there are 16 NTPs.  \nOther  target  transfer  programs  cover  a  wide  range  of  objectives  including  capital \ninvestment, infrastructure investment, and economic development programs in specific \nregions. Although during last decade this type of target transfer became less important, \nit still accounted for about 25% of local spending during 2006\u20132011, suggesting that \nlocal authorities are less dependent on nondiscretionary resources.  \nLocal  governments  are  responsible  for  proposing  activities  and  implementing \nassociated programs at the local level. They prepare proposals, then discuss them with \ncentral  government  agencies,  who  in  turn  submit  the  financial  proposal,  including \nallocation  to  provinces,  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Ministry  of  Planning  and \nInvestment. Implementation must follow regulations set out by the central government \nagencies. The allocation of NTP resources is based on a set of eligibility criteria in \nrelevant  Prime  Minister\u2019s  decisions  and  accompanying  circulars,  which  mainly \nconstitute socioeconomic indicators. \nIn  general,  Viet  Nam\u2019s  intragovernment  fiscal  transfer  system  works  effectively  to \nreduce fiscal disparities across jurisdictions. The final distributions of expenditures per \ncapita  both  across  and  within  provinces  are  fairly  equalized  (World  Bank  2014). \nNonetheless, there are some institutional issues that may hinder the effectiveness of \nsuch a system. First, the transfer amount is determined in the first years of a stability \nperiod and remains constant in nominal terms over the whole period. For some richer \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 613  Morgan and Long \n \nprovinces, local revenue increases could cover such shortages in real terms, but some \npoorer provinces suffer from the loss in real terms.  \nSecond,  there  are  some  weaknesses  in  the  transfer  norms.  For  example,  in  the \neducation sector, the norms use the number of school-aged children instead of enrolled \npupils, discouraging provinces that have low rates of school enrollment from increasing \nenrollment rates. Third, there are some incentive problems due to the right to have full \nresponsibility for resources allocation within assigned resources at the provincial level. \nWhile most provinces use national transfer norms for allocating recurrent expenditure, \nsome provinces design their own, creating incentive issues. For instance, while central \nnorms for health are based on population, norms adopted in some provinces are based \non permanent health care staff or physical endowment, thus encouraging district health \nsectors to expand their staff or benefiting disproportionately those places that are \nalready better equipped, and/or creating incentives to maintain inefficient health care \nfacilities (Le 2006). Management costs could also increase due to diversified sources \nof funding for NTPs. Around 56% of funding for all NTPs during 2012\u20132013 came from \ncentral authorities,  26% from  local  authorities, 5% from  external  donors,  4% from \nborrowing, and 9% from community contributions (World Bank 2014). Each NTP may \ncomply with some financial management rules and procedures. \nFourth, there is a huge gap between estimated budgets and realized budgets. It is \nestimated that the realized budget is usually 175% larger than the estimated one, \nimplying a lack of predictability in NTPs (World Bank 2014), ultimately impacting fiscal \nmanagement. Further, it puts pressure on local government budgets and leads to a \nproliferation of unfunded mandates. In fact, many local government authorities claim \nthat national programs and policies are not always accompanied by adequate or timely \nfinancing  (World  Bank  2014).  Under  such  cases,  local  governments  either  stop \nimplementing NTPs or use their limited resources to implement the programs and seek \nreimbursement later.  \nFifth, targets set in NTPs are ambiguous, and targets and resourcing are misaligned. A \nnumber of local authorities have argued that the targets set in NTPs are too ambitious \nand do not take into account costs and fiscal sustainability at the local government \nlevel (World Bank 2014). Moreover, funding is also not conditional on outputs under the \nprograms. In addition, capital projects developed under NTPs lack operations and \nmaintenance resources, hurting the sustainability of the NTP targets.  \nSix, it is difficult for local authorities to coordinate so many target programs, partly \nbecause the number of programs is high, and national and even subnational steering \ncommittees are ineffective. The total number of target transfer schemes is 44, and the \nnumber of programs is even higher if province-level target programs are taken into \naccount. The targets set out in such programs overlap (World Bank 2014). Meanwhile, \nthe ineffectiveness of national, and in some cases subnational, steering committees \nthat  have  been  established  to  help  coordinate  NTP  planning  and  budgeting  have \nresulted in fragmentation and weak monitoring and evaluation.  \nIn summary, the revenue side of subnational government budgets remains, in many \nrespects,  highly  centralized.  The  tax  rates  and  bases  of  taxes,  both  shared  and \nexclusive to subnational government, are determined centrally. Provinces do, however, \nhave the authority to set rates for a few local charges and fees and to determine how to \nallocate their revenues within their jurisdictions. Furthermore, despite the new budget \nlaw, some provinces use mechanisms contrary to the law, suggesting that de facto \ndecentralization is somewhat greater than legally sanctioned.  \n \n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 613  Morgan and Long \n \n1.5  Local Government Borrowing \nLocal  borrowing  has  emerged  as  an  important  topic  in  Viet  Nam,  particularly  for \nprovinces  that  are  unable  to  satisfy  their  capital  spending  needs  through  existing  \nlocal revenue and transfers. The current system is geared to redistributing locally \ncollected revenues, the bulk of which is contributed by a handful of provinces such  \nas  Ho  Chi  Minh  City,  Hanoi,  and  Binh  Duong,  and  have  highlighted  significant \ninfrastructure financing deficits.  \nThe new budget law and Public Debt Management Law 2009 stipulate the golden rule \n(i.e., provincial governments cannot borrow to meet recurrent expenditures). Borrowing \nis solely for capital investment projects that can generate returns to service debt. These \nlaws also place a ceiling on local outstanding debt at 30% of a province\u2019s annual \ncapital budget, except for Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, where the ceiling is set at 100% \nof the annual capital budget. The government\u2019s public debt management strategy, \n2012 set a ceiling of 3% of GDP for all local government debt and a ceiling of 65% of \nGDP for total public and publicly guaranteed debt including local debt. \nTable 4: Summary of Different Sources and Types of Local Borrowing \nType of Borrowing  Regulations  Constraints \nLocal government  Both the amount and rate of  Still underdeveloped, as only few \nbonds  borrowings are controlled.

Due to the borrowing \nceilings imposed under the new budget law, local authorities can also turn to other \nforms  of  borrowing,  such  as  local  infrastructure  development  funds  and  overseas \ndevelopment assistance (as onlent by central government), which are not subject to the \nsame limits. Local governments do not have direct access to financing from the central \nbank. In terms of administrative procedure, provincial borrowings are subject to various \napproval procedures depending on the utilization of fund and instruments, as stipulated \nby Public Debt Management Law 2009 and other secondary regulations. In general, all \nborrowings have to be inspected and approved by the Ministry of Finance and other \ncentral government agencies where applicable. \nThus,  borrowing  by  local  authorities  remains  very  low.  During  the  past  10  years, \nsubnational debt was kept below 3% of GDP and financed only 4% of development \nexpenditures. However, in 2011, around 13 provinces exceeded their outstanding debt \nstock limits of 30% of annual capital budget. Debt in some provinces was twice as high \nas the limit (World Bank 2014).  \nAlthough  nearly  all  provinces  have  engaged  in  some  form  of  debt  financing,  the \n10 largest borrowers represented more than two-thirds of subnational borrowing in \n2012 (Figure 5). The total subnational debt was also concentrated in these cities (42% \nof total local debt in 2012), but even within this group, Ho Chi Minh City dominated, \naccumulating 38% of the total local debt (World Bank 2014) (Box). \n   \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 613  Morgan and Long \n \nFigure 5: Share of Local Government Debt by Province \n(%) \n \nHCMC = Ho Chi Minh City. \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation using Ministry of Finance data. \nDebt Sustainability in Ho Chi Minh City \nHo Chi Minh City is the largest economic hub in Viet Nam, with relatively strong local \nrevenue mobilization. More than half of local financing (inclusive of new debt flows) comes \nfrom  decentralized  revenues.  The  ratio  of  decentralized  revenue  to  local  recurrent \nexpenditure  averaged  around  200%  during  2006\u20132011.  Of  total  expenditure,  capital \ninvestment made up 40%\u201350% during 2006\u20132011. The city\u2019s budget deficit is low, at about \n0.1% of its gross domestic product (GDP), and borrowing is also low. By the end of 2013, \ntotal outstanding debt from bond issuances was an estimated VND11.6 trillion, equal to 1.5% \nof local GDP and 49.0% of the capital budget in 2013. The average interest rate was 7% for \n3-year maturity, 6% for 5-year maturity, and 5% for 10-year maturity.  \nTwo ratios are used as measures of debt burden: (i) Ho Chi Minh City debt stock to GDP \n(threshold of 25% to assess solvency); and (ii) Ho Chi Minh City debt service to local \nrevenue (threshold of 25% to assess liquidity). The thresholds are benchmarks and not  \nstrict ceilings.  \nFor the baseline scenario, it is assumed that, in the medium term, economic indicators used \nin estimations (i.e., GDP growth, inflation, revenue and expenditure growth, and interest \nrate) are lower than during 2006\u20132011 but they will return to their 2006\u20132011 levels in the \nlong term. Under this scenario, city debts can be viewed as sustainable, with a manageable \ndebt stock\u2013GDP ratio. However, city authorities should recognize liquidity pressures and the \ngrowing share of interest payments in total recurrent spending. \nLiquidity pressure would be more obvious if a low scenario occurs. In this scenario, growth \nslows to 5% per year over the medium term and gradually stabilizes to below the historical \naverage of 8% over the long term, decentralized revenue growth falls by nearly one-third, \nand expenditures remain the same. Debt service requirements are likely to crowd out \nrecurrent expenditures. The debt service\u2013revenue ratio exceeds the threshold for almost the \nentire projection period; consequently, the golden rule will be broken over the long term. \nUnder  a  scenario  that  economic  conditions  become  more  favorable  than  the  baseline \nscenario (e.g., a higher growth rate, higher revenue, and expenditure growth), the city would \nmore than meet its capital spending needs and maintain sustainable levels of debt with \nstronger growth and revenue mobilization.  \nSource: World Bank (2014). \n14 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 613  Morgan and Long \n \nThe ratio of local government borrowing to total local government revenue was 4.0%  \nin 2007 and 2.4% in 2012. According to the World Bank (2014), local government \nborrowing tended to be higher in more developed, more fiscally autonomous, and more \nfiscally sustainable provinces. A higher borrowing level was also associated with a \nhigher share of spending in local expenditure. Therefore, although borrowing levels are \ngenerally  low,  they  seem  consistent  with  the  level  of  local  development,  capital \nspending needs, and fiscal sustainability trends. \n1.6  Fiscal Sustainability in Local Governments \nThe World Bank (2014) identified three sources of contingent liabilities in Viet Nam: \npublic financial funds (PFFs), local SOEs, and banking sector stress.  \nCurrently, Viet Nam has more than 30 central and local PFFs whose nature, scope, \nand scale of operations are diverse. Among these PFFs, only some specific central-\nlevel funds and local development investment funds have their own sources of revenue \nand expenditure mandates, and account for 95% of total expenditure of PFFs. The \nother local-level PFFs are small and operate mostly within provinces. Although most of \nthese PFFs are dependent on either the central or local government budgets for their \ninitial, and even operational capital (except for some funds that can mobilize revenues \nfrom beneficiaries such as health insurance and social insurance funds), their financial \nreports have never been incorporated into the annual budget and budget final account \ndocuments (World Bank 2014). \nCurrently, there are 28 operating local development investment funds (LDIFs), which \ncould  be  viewed  as  special  purpose  vehicles.  These  LDIFs  are  the  largest  PFFs \noperating at the local level. Legally, they are commercially oriented state financial \ninstitutions, are allowed to raise medium- and long-term capital, and can invest in  \ncost-recovery infrastructure projects. Their responsibility includes undertaking financial \nand development investments. Such types of special purpose vehicles have expanded \nconsiderably in Viet Nam and have mobilized a huge amount of funds for infrastructure \ninvestment. According to the World Bank (2014), the average annual growth rate of the \noperational capital of these funds was high at 40% during 2005\u20132011.  \nLDIFs  also  engage  in  short-term  borrowing  on  a  rollover  basis  from  state-owned \ncommercial banks (SOCBs) and other SOEs. These short-term borrowings can lead  \nto short-term-oriented  investments,  potentially  re-allocating LDIF  capital  away from \nlong-term infrastructure development. Inappropriate borrowing by the LDIFs can also \nhave a negative effect on the developing banking sector. \nThe  second  source  of contingent  liabilities  in  Viet  Nam  is  local  SOEs. There  are \n1,506 local SOEs and 982 public service enterprises. Due to their nature, these firms \nhave easier access to commercial loans, especially from SOCBs. This has led to an \nincreasing accumulation of debt of these firms. The World Bank (2014) estimated that \nmore than half of about US$3.5 billion of infrastructure financing from SOCBs was \nmade to SOEs. These firms also have easier access to onlent government external \nloans. For example, by 2012, public service enterprises in water management and \nsanitation had total debt from onlent government external loans of US$360 million \n(VND7.56 trillion) (World Bank 2014). By law, these firms are financially independent \nfrom the agencies that have ownership rights over the firms. Yet in reality, if SOEs and \npublic service enterprises get into trouble, they seek the support from their agencies to \ncoordinate the debt workout.  \n \n15 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 613  Morgan and Long \n \nLocal authorities in recent years have accumulated payment arrears to construction \nfirms, which, in turn, has prevented these firms from servicing their debts and has led \nto growing nonperforming loans in local banking systems. According to the National \nAudit Agency, by the end of 2011, total debts to construction companies by local \ngovernments amounted to VND91,273 billion.7 There were 15 provinces with payment \narrears  larger  than  100%  of  planned capital  expenditure. The  Ministry  of  Finance \nargues  that  this  was  in  part  due  to  loose  commitment  controls,  which  led  local \nauthorities to enter into arrangements with civil works contractors without adequate \nbudget authority. \nLocal government borrowing is not included in the budget balance, thus not accounted \nfor  in  the  local  budget  balance.  This  could  be  viewed  as  the  consequence  of \nrequirements regarding maintaining a balanced budget at the local government level, \nand exclusion of local budget deficits in the overall state budget deficit.  \nCurrent regulations relating to subnational borrowings may not reflect the ability of the \nlocal authorities to repay debts. The World Bank (2014) argued that it is hard to figure \nout the long-term creditworthiness of a province when looking at figures relating to debt \nstock and annual capital budget. In other words, local government borrowing does not \nnecessarily reflect local government fiscal capacity. In 2011, many provinces, including \nthose with less fiscal capacity, had borrowing much higher than the borrowing ceiling \n(World Bank 2014). Another issue is that, under current regulations, local government \nborrowing does not cover guarantees and other contingent liabilities. This makes the \nfigures on local government borrowing not reliable and hard to enforce.  \nThe ceiling on local government debt does not create proper incentives for borrowers. \nThe World Bank (2014) pointed out that the total amount of debt stock, which does not \nreflect the actual obligations for repaying the principal and interest, is not a good \nindicator since it does not reflect the actual debt burden faced by the local government. \nThis, in turn, will cause difficulty in estimating the debt obligations in the future. In fact, \ncompliance with debt limits in a particular year does not automatically ensure that a \nlocal authority will be able to repay its debt in the long term. \nCurrently, there is no formal requirement on reporting and disclosure of local debt to \nthe public. Usually, such information is required to be reported to the Banking and \nFinance Department of the Ministry of Finance.8 This limits the development of the \nlocal government bond market since private investors have little information on the \nlocal authorities and cannot assess the creditworthiness of the local government fiscal \nstance. Reports from local authorities, when received, are usually late and not detailed, \nwhile processing such information is time-consuming since each province has its own \nreporting format. \n2.  EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF DEFICIT SUSTAINABILITY \nIN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS \nIn this section, the deficit sustainability of local governments in Viet Nam is analyzed \nusing two estimation methods.

To account for population differences \namong provinces, the above approach is also used with a vector of four variables:  \nown-source revenue per capita, expenditure per capita, GDP per capita, and balancing \ntransfer per capita.  \nSecond, to further examine fiscal sustainability at the provincial level, based upon the \nBohn (2008) model, this fiscal reaction equation is used: \n\u2019 (2)\n\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udefc0+\ud835\udefc1\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc62 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\u22121+\ud835\udefc2\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 +\ud835\udefc3\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 +\ud835\udefc4\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 +\n\ud835\udc4b \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udefc5+\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc56 +\ud835\udf16\ud835\udc61 +\ud835\udf17\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61  \nwhere Surplus  is the primary surplus of province i at time t, GDPgap  is the GDP gap, \nit it\nEXPgap   is  the  expenditure  gap,  BT   is  the  share  of  balancing  transfer  in  total \nit it\nexpenditure, X  is a vector of provincial characteristics, \u03c0 is fixed province effect, \u03b5 is \nit t\nthe fixed time effect, and \u03c5  is the error term.  \nit\nSurplus  is  calculated  as  the  ratio  of  fiscal  surplus  to  GDP.  Fiscal  surplus  is  the \ndifference  between  local  government  revenue  and  local  government  expenditure. \nBalancing transfer and targeted transfer in local government revenue are not included. \nThe GDP gap is the difference between the realized GDP and trend values of GDP or \ndeviation of GDP from its trend.  \nSimilar to Bohn (2008), a positive value of the GDP gap implies that the realized GDP \nis higher than its trend value. Similarly, the expenditure gap is the difference between \nthe realized expenditure and its trend at the provincial level. A positive value of the \nexpenditure gap implies that the realized expenditure is higher than its trend. Both \ntrend values are calculated by using the Hodrick\u2013Prescott filter using a smoothing \nparameter of 10,000. Therefore, the expenditure gap is expected to have a negative \ninfluence on the fiscal surplus, and the output gap variable is expected to have a \npositive influence on the fiscal surplus. If output is below its trend, the surplus should \ndecrease. Similarly, if government spending is above its trend, the surplus should \ndecrease. To examine how the fiscal deficit at the central government level may have \nimplications for local government fiscal surplus, the share of balancing transfer in total \nexpenditure is used. The more a province is dependent on balancing transfers, it is \nexpected that the less fiscal surplus it will enjoy. \nInstead of using data compiled by provinces due to missing data (i.e., some provinces \ndo not publish their fiscal data in some years), data consolidated by the Ministry of \nFinance are used. These data, however, do not categorize expenditure and revenue \nitems  at  the  provincial  level.  To  account  for  different  fiscal  capacities,  in  some \n17 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 613  Morgan and Long \n \nestimations, the sample is divided into two groups: (i) provinces for which the share \nrate is 100% (i.e., poorer provinces); and (ii) provinces with sharing rates lower than \n100% (i.e., better-off provinces).  \nTo  avoid  spurious  regressions,  this  study  examines  whether  the  panel  data  are \nstationary by using panel unit root tests (Levin, Lin, James\u2013Chu 2002; Breitung 2002; \nIm, Pesaran, Shin 2003) and Fisher-type tests using Augment Dickey\u2013Fuller (ADF) and \nPhillips\u2013Perron (PP) tests (Maddala and Wu 1999). Levin, Lin, James\u2013Chu (2002) and \nBreitung (2002) models were based on the ADF test and assumed homogeneity in the \ndynamics  of  the  autoregressive  coefficients for  all  panel  units  with  cross-sectional \nindependence,  while  Im  et  al.  (2003);  Fisher\u2013ADF;  and  Fisher\u2013PP  tests  allow  for \nheterogeneity in the autoregressive coefficients for all panel members. The alternative \nhypothesis simply implies that some or all of the individual series are stationary. The \npanel unit root results are presented in Table 5.  \nThere  is  a  large  difference  in  the  test  results.  While  under  the  assumption  of \nhomogeneity in the dynamic of autoregressive coefficients, Levin, Lin, James\u2013Chu \n(2002) and Breitung (2002) show that there is no unit root in individual variables, while \nIm, Pesaran, Shin (2003); Fisher\u2013ADF; and Fisher\u2013PP tests show that all variables \nhave unit roots at the level and no unit root at the first difference. Because the sample \nincludes all provinces in the country, heterogeneity is surely present. Therefore, it can \nbe concluded that there are unit roots for the data in the level and no unit root for data \nat the first difference. \nTable 5: Panel Unit Root Test \nUnit Root   Unit Root  \n(assumes common   (assumes individual  \nNull Hypothesis  unit root process)  unit root process) \nLevin, Lin,  Im, Pesaran,  ADF\u2013 PP\u2013\nStatistics  James\u2013Chu  Breitung  Shin   Fisher  Fisher \nLevel           \nLocal government expenditure  \u20135.81***  \u20134.30***  1.15  126.93  128.24 \nLocal government revenue  \u20137.55***  \u20133.15***  \u20131.05  130.90  225.90*** \nBalance transfer  \u201317.24***  \u20130.35  \u20131.59  133.65  118.35 \nLocal government expenditure   \u20134.72***  \u20134.74***  1.84  120.46  115.58 \nper capita \nLocal government revenue   \u20138.29***  \u20132.40***  \u20131.27  136.70  222.90*** \nper capita \nLocal GDP per capita  \u20134.85***  1.52  1.16  106.30  95.50 \nBalance transfer per capita  \u201319.58***  \u20130.55  \u20132.14**  138.27  134.62 \nFirst difference           \nLocal government expenditure  \u20139.28***  \u20132.16***  \u20135.66***  222.36***  666.58*** \nLocal government revenue  \u20131.05  \u201310.01***  \u20133.75***  174.92***  833.69*** \nBalance transfer  \u201321.66***  \u201314.80***  \u201310.96***  337.30***  638.29*** \nLocal government expenditure   \u20137.14***  \u20132.48***  \u20135.67***  222.48***  688.28*** \nper capita \nLocal government revenue   \u20130.52  \u201310.18***  \u20133.52***  169.16***  821.24*** \nper capita \nLocal GDP per capita  \u201313.65***  \u20133.55***  \u20134.84***  202.40***  378.90*** \nBalance transfer per capita  \u201321.94***  \u201314.68***  \u201311.33***  345.62***  641.05*** \nADF = Augment Dickey\u2013Fuller; PP = Phillips\u2013Perron; GDP = gross domestic product. \nNote: * p<0.1, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01. \n18 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 613  Morgan and Long \n \nAfter testing for unit roots, co-integration among the variables of interest is investigated. \nPedroni (2000) proposed a methodology to test for panel data co-integration, which \nallows testing for the co-integrated relationship in four different models: model without \nheterogeneous trend and ignoring common time effect (M1), model without common \ntime effect and allowing heterogeneous trend (M2), model with heterogeneous trend \nand  allowing  common  time  effect  (M3),  and  model  with  common  time  effect  and \nignoring  heterogeneous  trend  (M4).  Pedroni  (1999)  showed  that  there  are  seven \ndifferent statistics for the co-integration test: panel v-statistic, panel \u03c1\u03c1-statistic, Pedroni \nPanel-statistic, panel ADF-statistic, group rho-statistic, group Pedroni Panel-statistic, \nand group ADF-statistic. The first four statistics are known as panel co-integration \nstatistics and are based on the within-dimension approach.

For the first \nvector of the variable, six statistics from the M2 co-integration test strongly reject the \nnull-hypothesis of no co-integration in the sample. Meanwhile, only two statistics from \nthe M3 co-integration test show a strong rejection of the null hypothesis, while two \nstatistics show a weak rejection (at 90% confidence level). Although there are mixed \nresults of the co-integration of the variables, it is hard to accept the null hypothesis that \nthere is no unit root in the data.  \nPanel B of Table 6 reports the results of the co-integration test for the vector of four \nvariables: expenditure per capita, revenue per capita, balancing transfer per capita, \nand  GDP  per  capita.  The  results  indicate  that  in  both  cases  (with-  and  without-\nheterogeneous trends), four of the seven statistics show a strong rejection of the null \nhypothesis  that  there  is  no  panel  co-integration  among  the  sample,  so  the  null \nhypothesis of no co-integration among the four variables can be accepted.  \nFollowing Pedroni (2004), the long-term relationship between the co-integrated variable \nis estimated by using the fully modified OLS estimator to avoid the bias of the OLS \nestimator  (Table  7).  The  fully  modified  OLS  results  indicate  that  the  coefficients  \nof local government expenditure in all specifications are statistically significant. The \nestimation results from the fully modified OLS panel estimation indicate that a 1% \nincrease in expenditure leads to an increase of local government revenue by 1.45% \n(for  all  provinces)  and  1.60%  (for  poorer  provinces).9 The  results  support  fiscal \nsustainability  in  the  whole  sample  and  for  the  sample  of  poorer  provinces.  The \nestimation results also indicate that balancing transfers have a negative relationship \nwith  revenues  in  poorer  provinces,  suggesting  that  balancing  transfers  may  \ncreate  some  incentive  issues  and  ultimately  discourage  provinces  in  raising  their \nrevenue efforts. \nThe relationship between three variables is then examined by using expenditure at the \nlocal government level as dependent variables as follows:  \n(3) \n \n\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc52\nIf \u03b1e<1,\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc56i\ud835\udc61.e=., \ud835\udf0fa+ 1\ud835\udefc% \ud835\udc45in\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61c+rea\ud835\udefdse\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61in+ r\ud835\udc62e\ud835\udc56v\ud835\udc61enue increases expenditure by less than 1%), then \nfiscal sustainability is supported. The results in panel B of Table 7 show that the \ncoefficient  of  revenue  in  all  specifications  is  lower  than  1,  supporting  the  results \npresented in panel A with revenue as the dependent variable.  \nTo account for provincial heterogeneity, the long-term relationship is analyzed between \nfour variables, revenue per capita, expenditure per capita, provincial GDP per capita, \nand balancing per capita, using the fully modified OLS estimator panel. The results are \nreported in panel C (with revenue per capita as the dependent variable) and panel D \n(with expenditure per capita as the dependent variable).

The estimation results show that the fiscal surplus in \nthe last period has a negative effect on the current fiscal surplus, ensuring that the \nfiscal surplus is not explosive and supports fiscal sustainability at the local level. The \n22 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 613  Morgan and Long \n \nestimation results obtained from dynamic GMM indicate that the local GDP gap has a \npositive effect on the fiscal surplus, although they do not have an economic effect for \npoorer provinces. While the expenditure gap has the expected sign for the specification \nwith the whole sample, it has a positive effect on fiscal surplus for poorer provinces. \nThis suggests that provinces that suffer from expenditure gaps may increase their \nefforts to  increase  their  own-source  revenues,  which  could  help  them  cover gaps  \nin expenditure and accumulate extra revenue. This, in turn, supports the previous \nconjecture that the balancing transfer system may discourage provinces in increasing \ntheir  revenue  efforts.  The  coefficient  on  the  ratio  of  balancing  transfer  to  total \nexpenditure is negative and statistically significant, suggesting that the more dependent \non  government  transfers  a  province  is,  the  higher  the  likelihood  that  it  will  go  \ninto deficit.  \n3.  CONCLUSIONS AND SOME POLICY IMPLICATIONS \nSince the new budget law was promulgated in 2002, the fiscal responsibilities of local \nauthorities  have  significantly  increased;  thus,  local  fiscal  policies  play  a  large  \nrole in Viet Nam\u2019s growth and development. To fulfill their growing role, the central \ngovernment has granted local authorities more financial resources, including sharing \nparts of its revenue with local governments. Intergovernmental fiscal transfers have \nalso  been  reformed  to  play  an  important  role  in  mitigating  vertical  and  horizontal  \nfiscal imbalances.  \nHowever,  several  issues  hinder  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  fiscal \ndecentralization in Viet Nam, including unclear expenditure assignments among tiers  \nof governments, various measures and regulations that limit the autonomy of local \ngovernments in carrying out expenditure revenue management, and a lack of minimum \nstandards  for  expenditure  outcomes.  Regarding  intergovernmental  fiscal  transfers, \nalthough the transfer system is working fairly well, weaknesses in transfer norms, \nincentive problems in resources mobilization and allocation, and existence of many \nnational  and  provincial  targeted  programs  with  overlapping  objectives  and  targets  \nalso limit the efficiency of this system. Local governments are permitted to borrow in \ncapital markets, but it seems that the fundamental foundations for local government \nborrowing management are weak. Lack of transparency is also observed in all aspects \nof fiscal decentralization.  \nTo make the fiscal decentralization work better in Viet Nam, it is recommended that:  \n(i)  The central government should make expenditure assignments more explicit. It \ncould also give up some of its responsibilities to lower tiers of governments. \nThe central government also needs to design minimum standards of services \ndelivery, not only to secure acceptable equality in services delivery across \njurisdictions but also to provide local governments with more autonomy over \nresources allocation. \n(ii)  The central government should review its current sharing arrangements such \nas  using  separate  formulas  for  each  revenue  source  instead  of  using  a \ncommon  formula.  The  central  government  could  further  strengthen  local \ngovernment revenues by allowing provinces to impose surtaxes on some types \nof taxes such as personal income taxes and local business taxes, or by giving \nthem more autonomy in setting fees and charges. Introducing a property tax \ncould be considered in the longer term. \n23 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 613  Morgan and Long \n \n(iii)  Regarding intergovernmental fiscal transfers, some measures could be taken \nimmediately,  such  as  revising  transfer  norms,  adopting  a  formula-based \ntransfer system, and avoiding negotiations to mitigate incentive problems in \nresources allocation.  \n(iv)  The central and provincial governments should review the current targeted \nprograms, including objectives and targets, and identify overlapping programs. \nResources allocations for each program should be matched with the targets. In \naddition, financial resources for each program should be linked to outcomes.  \n(v)  To strengthen the current legal foundations for local government borrowing, \nareas  that  should  be  emphasized  include  having  a  transparent  reporting \nsystem  for  local  government  debt  reporting,  developing  a  creditworthiness \nevaluation mechanism for local governments, and specifying a threshold on \nlocal debt stocks and debt servicing to ensure debt sustainability. \n(vi)  Measures  should  be  created  that  ensure  fiscal  accountability  at  the  local \ngovernment level.  \n   \n24 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 613  Morgan and Long \n \nREFERENCES \nBessho, S. 2016.

This study has two objectives: (i) to take stock of the current institutional framework for intergovernmental fiscal relations in Viet Nam, and (ii) to empirically assess the debt sustainability of local governments in Viet Nam. The empirical analysis uses two estimation methods: (i) fully modified ordinary least squares (OLS) to estimate the long-term correlations between co-integration equations, including vectors of co-integration variables, and stochastic regressor innovations; and (ii) fiscal reaction equations at the provincial level, based upon the Bohn (2008) model.
