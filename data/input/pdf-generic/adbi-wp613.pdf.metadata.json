In  1996,  the  first  State  Budget  Law  was  promulgated,  and  fiscal \ndecentralization was formally mandated. This law was then revised in 2002 and put into \noperation  in  2004,  giving  more  autonomy  to  local  governments,  especially  at  the \nprovincial level to promote sustainable development underpinned by local preferences \nand  economic  stability,  equity  across  provinces,  efficient  services  delivery,  and \nenhanced transparency and accountability in public finances.  \n\nToday, local spending accounts for just over one-half of general government spending, \nwhile  local  revenue  accounts  for  over  one-third  of  general  government  revenue,  and \njust  over  one-half  when  extrabudgetary  sources  are  included.  These  are  significant \nshares  when  compared  to  other  countries,  particularly  those  at  a  similar  level  of \ndevelopment to Viet Nam (World Bank 2014). \n\nThis study has two objectives: (i) to take stock of the current institutional framework for \nintergovernmental fiscal relations, and (ii) to empirically assess the deficit sustainability \nof local governments in Viet Nam. \n\n1.  LOCAL GOVERNMENT SYSTEM AND FISCAL \n\nDECENTRALIZATION IN VIET NAM SINCE 1975 \n\n1.1  Local Government System \n\nViet Nam\u2019s local government system was established in 1945, at the same time as the \nDemocratic  Republic  of  Viet  Nam,  operating  under  the  principle  of  democratic \ncentralism.  This  principle  created  a  hierarchical  top-down  administrative  system, \nmeaning  that  subordinates  obey  superiors,  and  local  governments  obey  the  central \ngovernment. Today, Viet Nam has four tiers of government: (i) central; (ii) 63 provinces, \nincluding 5 major cities; (iii) 710 district-level cities, towns (in urban areas), and districts \n(in rural areas); and (iv) 11,145 wards and townships (in urban areas) and communes \n(in rural areas). Each tier of government has both legislative and executive authorities. \nAt  the  central  level,  legislative  authority  rests  with  the  National  Assembly,  and \nexecutive authority rests with line ministries and agencies. At the local level, each tier \nof  government  has  a  people\u2019s  council  to  exercise  legislative  authority  and  a  people\u2019s \ncommittee and line departments to exercise executive authority. \n\n1.2  Fiscal Decentralization since 1975 \n\nFrom  1975  to  1989,  Viet  Nam  remained  a  centralized  fiscal  and  economic  system. \nLocal  governments  acted  as  an  agency  for  the  central  government,  and  they  also  \nwere  assigned  some  limited  own-source  revenue  including  fees,  charges,  asset \ndepreciation,  some  shared  revenue  including  revenue  from  the  profit  of  state-owned \nenterprises  (SOEs),  and  taxes  on  agriculture  and  industrial  activities.  In  1983,  the \ngovernment issued a resolution to further clarify local government own-source revenue \nand revenue shared by local governments with the central government. Sharing rates \nwere still determined by the central government. The central government also designed \na subsidy scheme for provinces that were unable to cover their local expenditures with \nown-source and shared revenues.  \n\n \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 613 \n \n\nMorgan and Long \n\nDuring this period, the role played by local governments in the budget-making process \ngrew,  and  the  central  government  began  considering  local  governments  to  be  \nan  integral  component  of  the  state  budget.  In  1989,  the  government  implemented  a \nresolution  that  regulated  the  spending  responsibilities  of  and  revenue  sources  for  \nlocal  governments.  Under  this  resolution,  local  government  revenue  came  from  three \ndifferent  sources:  (i)  100%  of  locally  collected  revenue  (e.g.,  collections  to  cover \ndepreciation,  taxes  on  the  slaughter  of  livestock,  and  various  fees  and  charges); \n(ii) shared tax revenue with the central government (e.g., revenue from profits of central \nand  local  SOEs  and  industrial  activities);  and  (iii)  conditional  transfers  to  balance  \nlocal  governments\u2019  budgets.  Under  this  new  arrangement,  shared  revenue  could  \nnot  be  retained  by  local  governments;  thus,  of  44  provinces,  14  returned  additional \nrevenue  to  the  central  government  from  shared  revenue  because  their  local  budgets \nwere balanced.  \n\nIn  1996,  to  further  reform  the  central\u2013local  government  relationship,  the  first  budget  \nlaw  was  promulgated,  coming  into  effect  in  1997.  This  law  outlined  the  spending \nresponsibility and revenue allocations for central and local governments, and regulated \nthe borrowing of local governments and intragovernment fiscal transfers. This law was \nthen revised in 1998, coming into effect in 1999. Under the revised law, the lower tiers \nof  local  government  (i.e.,  district  and  commune  levels)  were  assured  greater  revenue \nand expenditure responsibilities. For example, they were to secure at least 70% of their \nrevenue  from  taxes  on  the  rights  of  land  transfer,  land  and  housing  taxes,  licensing \ntaxes from small businesses, and agriculture taxes. This law also defined the roles of \ndifferent agencies engaged in the preparation of the central budget as well as the roles \nof line ministries and local governments in implementation.  \n\nTo  give  more  fiscal  responsibility  to  local  governments,  especially  at  the  provincial \nlevel,  the  new  budget  law  was  promulgated  in  2002,  taking  effect  in  2004.1 This  law \nhas several distinguishing features: \n\n(i)  The  central  government  has  given  local  governments  more  autonomy.  While \nthe  1997  law  established  intergovernmental  fiscal  relationships  among  all  \ntiers  of  government,  the  new  law  only  regulates  the  fiscal  relations  between  \nthe  central  and  provincial  levels.  Local  governments  now  have  autonomy  \nin  deciding  the  fiscal  relationship  among  government  levels  within  their \njurisdictions. \n\n(ii)  The  fiscal  capacity  of  local  governments  has  been  strengthened.  The  central \ngovernment now shares some types of revenues that used to be solely central \ngovernment  revenue  sources  (e.g.,  special  consumption  taxes,  and  gasoline \nand oil taxes) with local governments. \n\n(iii)  The central government also has designed some incentives for revenue efforts \n\nmade by local governments.  \n\n(iv)  The  central  government  has  also  established  a  legal  foundation  for  the \n\nadoption of formula-based intergovernmental fiscal transfers.  \n\n(v) \n\nIt  established  budget  stabilization  periods  of  3\u20135  years  as  determined  by  the \nNational  Assembly.  Since  2004,  there  have  been  three  stability  periods:  \n2004\u20132006, 2007\u20132010, and 2011\u20132016.  \n\n                                                \n1  Different  from  many  other  economies,  the  budget  law  in  Viet  Nam  not  only  covers  the  central \ngovernment  budget  but  also  that  of  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations,  and  subnational  budget \nmanagement  arrangements,  which  are  usually  treated  separately  in  decentralization  and  local \ngovernment laws. This feature reflects the country\u2019s nested budget system (World Bank 2014). \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 613 \n \n\nMorgan and Long \n\nThe  new  budget  law  specifies  that  there  is  a  single,  unified  public  sector  budget  that \nmust  ultimately  be  ratified  by  the  National  Assembly,  implying  that  the  National \nAssembly is given more power in the fiscal decentralization process. The transfer norm \ndecision was also moved from the Ministry of Finance to the National Assembly, and is \nmade  public  to  sector  ministries  and  provinces,  thus  improving  the  transparency  and \nbudget process. Moreover, the National Assembly approves not only estimates of total \nrevenues and expenditures but also their composition.  \n\nFigure 1: Fiscal Process in Viet Nam \n\n \n\nSource: World Bank (2014).  \n\nDifferent  from  other  countries,  the  hierarchical  nature  of  the  Viet  Nam  fiscal  system \ncomplicates  the  budget-making  process.  Although  each  local  government  has  some \nautonomy  in  estimating  its  budget,  budgets  of  lower-level  governments  are  examined \nand approved by the higher level of government. Eventually, the outcomes of the entire \nprocess  must  be  integrated  into  the  single  state  budget.  This  hierarchical  nature  also \nundermines  the  autonomy  of  the  lower  level  of  governments,  as  their  budgets  are \nhighly subject to changes and revision requests by higher levels of governments.  \n\n1.3  Modern Fiscal Decentralization in Viet Nam \n\n1.3.1  Expenditure Decentralization \n\nSince  the  new  budget  law,  local  authorities  have  been  given  more  power  in  making \ndecisions  relating  to  resources  allocation  within  their  provinces,  as  the  law  defines \nspending  functions  for  the  central  government  and  local  governments.  The  central \ngovernment still has the exclusive responsibility for external relations, foreign trade and \nforeign  assistance, food safety,  and  drug  regulation.  Responsibility  for  all  other  public \nservices is shared among the various tiers of governments.  \n\nExpenditure  assignments  also  take  into  account  the  special  character  of  provinces  \nand  are  asymmetric  across  provinces.  Fiscally  advantaged  provinces  enjoy  greater \nfiscal  and  administrative  autonomy,  while  central  government  agencies  have  a  more \nexpansive role in fiscally disadvantaged provinces. \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 613 \n \n\nMorgan and Long \n\nTable 1: Ratio of Decentralized Revenue to Total Expenditure \n(%) \n\nExpenditure \n\nTotal expenditure \nDevelopment investment expenditures (including capital expenditure) \nDebt services and overseas aid \nRecurrent expenditure \nEducation \nHealth \nSocial welfare \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations using Ministry of Finance data.  \n\n2007 \n46.6 \n62.7 \n15.2 \n50.3 \n86.2 \n79.0 \n14.0 \n\n2010 \n53.1 \n73.4 \n9.7 \n53.5 \n89.6 \n80.8 \n17.9 \n\n2013 \n52.6 \n68.9 \n6.3 \n53.7 \n90.9 \n84.4 \n24.5 \n\nLocal  government  spending  makes  up  an  important  share  of  total  government \nexpenditure in Viet Nam (Table 1). The share of local government spending increased \nfrom  47%  in  2007  to  about  53%  in  2013.  In  2013,  local  governments  made  up  about \n70% of total capital spending, since the central government\u2019s responsibility was limited \nto large national projects. Their share in recurrent expenditure also increased to about \n54% in 2013. Except for social security functions, which still accounts for a large share \nof  central  government  spending  (about  75%),  local  governments\u2019  share  of  total \nrecurrent spending in other government functions was high. For example, in 2013, local \ngovernments were responsible for 91% of total recurrent expenditure in the education \nsector and 84% in the health sector.2  \n\nAt the lower levels of local government, the degree of decentralization is rather high. In \nmany  provinces,  district  spending  constituted  more  than  45%  of  total  local  spending \n(World  Bank  2014).  Lower-level  local  governments  were  responsible  for  most  of  the \nrecurrent expenditure in the education sector (75% in 2012) and health sector (60% in \n2012). Uchimura and Kono (2012) and the World Bank (2014) found that the shares of \nrural  population  and  the  level  of  local  capacity  in  provinces  are  important  factors  in \nexplaining the level of district expenditure in local expenditure. However, the degree of \ncapital  expenditure  decentralization  between  the  provincial  level  and  lower  levels  is \nrather limited. Only 30% of provincial total capital expenditure was implemented by the \nlower levels of government. This could be attributed to some concerns over efficiencies \nregarding capital spending at the lower levels.  \n\nAlthough Viet Nam has accelerated its fiscal decentralization process, there are some \ninstitutional  factors  that  may  have  negative  effects  on  the  effectiveness  of  such \ndecisions. First, the spending responsibilities for each level of government are still not \nclearly  defined,  thus  creating  unnecessary  overlaps.  Except  for  some  exclusive \nresponsibilities  as  previously  mentioned,  responsibility  for  all  other  public  services  is \nshared between the central and provincial governments, including national defense and \nsocial  insurance  and  protection.  While  the  local  contributions  for  these  areas  are \ntypically  small,  they  disproportionately  affect  poorer  provinces,  and  sometimes  these \nexpenses  cannot  be  anticipated  and  therefore  require  diverting  local  resources  from \nother services (World Bank 2014).  \n\nMoreover,  if  coordination  among  tiers  of  government  is  not  smooth,  ambiguous \nexpenditure  assignments  may  cause  overlaps  and  inefficiency.  The  most  visible \noverlaps are seen in the education and health sectors. For example, in the education \nsector,  the  central  government  and  local  governments  co-share  administering, \n                                                \n2  Viet Nam\u2019s data do not distinguish capital expenditure for the education and health sectors, so data on \n\neducation and health expenditures are included in recurrent spending (World Bank 2014). \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 613 \n \n\nMorgan and Long \n\nfinancing,  managing,  and  delivering  almost  all  levels  of  education,  from  pre-\nkindergarten  to  university.  Such  overlaps  in  expenditure  responsibilities  create  a \nnumber of burdens for local government, including time and efforts to clarify respective \nfunctions for each level (World Bank 2014).  \n\nSecond, although the new budget law lists spending functions for both the central and \nlocal governments, the lists are both overdetailed and vague, impacting the autonomy \nand  flexibility  of  local  governments.  For  example,  they  list  some  ambiguous  functions \nlike investment in SOEs, state economic organizations, and state financial institutions, \nbut  spending  functions  in  certain  areas  may  be  different  among  provinces  due  to \nsocioeconomic development conditions. \n\nthe  new  budget \n\nto  assign  expenditure \nlaw  gives  provinces  autonomy \nThird, \nresponsibilities to lower tiers of governments, which leads to substantial heterogeneity \nin provinces\u2019 expenditure assignments. In the first stability period, all three subnational \ngovernments  were  responsible  for  health  care  in  25  provinces,  provincial  and \ncommunal  governments  shared  the  responsibility  in  eight  provinces,  provincial  and \ndistrict  governments  shared  the  service  responsibility  in  14,  and  the  service  was  the \nexclusive responsibility of the provincial government in 17 provinces (Le 2006). \n\n1.3.2  Revenue Decentralization  \n\nRevenue  collected  in  Viet  Nam  can  be  grouped  into  three  categories:  (i)  central \ngovernment  revenue,  (ii)  revenue  entirely  retained  by  local  governments,  and \nlocal  governments. \n(iii) revenue  shared  between \nAccordingly, shared taxes include value-added tax (VAT) (except the VAT on imported \ngoods),  corporate  income  tax  (except  some  special  cases),  personal  income  taxes, \ntaxes  on  profits  remitted  abroad  (except  for  the  petroleum  industry),  special \nconsumption  taxes,  and gasoline  and  oil fees.  Note that  the  sharing  of  these  taxes  is \nbased on the domicile of the taxpayer, and tax rates and bases are set by the central \ngovernment and are uniform throughout the country.  \n\nthe  central  government  and \n\nThe  sharing  rate  has  some  special  features,  including  a  new  rate  introduced  at  the \nbeginning of each stabilization period, a uniform rate for all shared taxes, a fixed rate \nduring a stability period, and different rates applied in different provinces. The sharing \nrates are established at the beginning of each stabilization period and are based upon \nprovincial fiscal capacity. Table 2 presents the sharing rates of provinces that had rates \nof less than 100%.  \n\nTaxes and fees fully dedicated to provinces include taxes on land and housing, natural \nresources  (excluding  petroleum),  license  taxes,  taxes  on  transfer  of  land-use  rights, \ntaxes on the use of agriculture land, fees on land use, land rent, revenue from leasing \nand  sale  of  houses  owned  by  the  state,  registration  fees,  and  revenue from  state-run \nlotteries, as well as various fees and charges. Of all of the revenue sources, this type of \nrevenue is the most suitable type of own-source revenue in the standard language of \nfiscal decentralization. This revenue source, together with shared revenues that can be \nviewed as fiscal transfers, makes up decentralized revenue. They represent the core of \nthe locally collected revenue.  \n\nThe  new  budget  law  also  allows  provincial  governments  to  design  their  own  revenue \nassignments to districts and communes within their jurisdictions, although there are still \nsome  general  principles  and  minimum  standards  that  the  provinces  must  follow. \nHowever, more autonomy in assigning expenditure responsibilities enable provinces to \ndelineate  expenditure  responsibilities  based  upon  the  fiscal  capacity  and  rural  and \nurban characteristics of local governments.  \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 613 \n \n\nMorgan and Long \n\nTable 2: Portion of Shared Provincial and Central Government  \nRevenues Retained by Provinces  \n(%) \n\nProvince \n\nHanoi \nQuang Ninh \nHai Phong \nVinh Phuc \nBac Ninh \nKhanh Hoa \nHo Chi Minh City \nDong Nai \nBinh Duong \nBa Ria\u2013Vung Tau \nLong An \nTien Giang \nVinh Long \nCan Tho \nOthers \n\n2004\u20132006 \n32 \n98 \n95 \n86 \n100 \n52 \n29 \n49 \n44 \n42 \n99 \n99 \n90 \n95 \n100 \n\n2007\u20132010 \n31 \n76 \n90 \n67 \n100 \n53 \n26 \n45 \n40 \n46 \n100 \n100 \n100 \n95 \n100 \n\n2011\u20132015 \n42 \n70 \n88 \n60 \n93 \n77 \n23 \n51 \n44 \n44 \n100 \n100 \n100 \n91 \n100 \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 compilation from Ministry of Finance data. \n\nThe law also includes an incentive for revenue collection at the local government level. \nA  local  government  can  retain  up  to  30%  of  all  shared  revenue  actually  collected  in \nexcess  of  the  estimated  amount.  Further,  to  avoid  the  temptation  to  underestimate \nfuture  shared  tax  revenues,  the  law  stipulates  that  the  excess  amount  retained  must \nnot  exceed  the  difference  between  this  year\u2019s  actual  revenue  in  shared  taxes  and  \nlast year\u2019s.  \n\nDuring  2006\u20132012,  decentralized  revenue  in  Viet  Nam  constituted  about  9.6%  of  \ngross domestic product (GDP). Decentralized revenue, however, did not account for a \nlarge  share  of  local  economies  in  Viet  Nam.  In  most  of  the  provinces,  decentralized \nrevenue was equal to about 7.0% of local GDP; these provinces also retained 100% of \nthe  shared  revenue  that  they  collect.  This  is  because  some  of  the  most  potential \nsources  of  revenue,  such  as  trade-related  revenue,  petroleum-related  revenue,  and \ncorporate income taxes from large SOEs, accrue to the central government and not to \nlocal governments.3  \n\nFigure  2  presents  the  contribution  of  decentralized  revenue  to  total  revenue  at  the  \nlocal  government  level.  The  share  of  revenue  that  is  fully  dedicated  to  provinces  \n(i.e., own-source revenue) declined from 24.3% in 2004 to 12.6% in 2007 and further to \n9.0% in 2013.4 The share of own-source revenue and shared tax revenue also declined \nfrom 44.8% in 2004 to 30.8% in 2007, yet the share of these two sources of revenue \nwas stable at about 30.0% of total revenue during 2007\u20132012. This implies a declining \nrole  of  decentralized  revenue  in  total  local  government  revenues.  Figure  2  also \nindicates a huge gap in the importance of these two sources between provinces with a \n\n                                                \n3  In  2011,  despite  the  declining  trend,  trade  and  petroleum-related  revenues  are  still  equal  to  8%  of \nnational  GDP.  Similarly,  corporate  income  tax  from  unified  accounting  firms  is  equal  to  7%  of  GDP \n(World Bank 2014). \n\n4  Compared  to  other  Asian  economies,  this  share  of  this  own-source  revenue  is  similar  (World  \n\nBank 2014). \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 613 \n \n\nMorgan and Long \n\nsharing  rate  of  100%  and  provinces  with  a  sharing  rate  of  less  than  100%.  In  2013, \nabout  60%  of total  revenue  of  better-off provinces  was from  these two  sources,  while \nthis figure was about 25% in poorer ones. \n\nFigure 2: Share of Decentralized Revenue in Total Local Government Revenue \n(%) \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations using Ministry of Finance data. \n\n \n\nDespite efforts to give more power to local governments to raise their revenue, several \nobstacles  continue  to  limit  the  size  of  local  government  own-source  revenue.  First, \nthere  are  two  concerns  about  the  shared  revenues.  On  one  hand,  the  sharing  rate  \nis  set  to  take  into  account  differences  in  fiscal  capacity.  However,  in  reality,  sharing \nrates  are  determined  through  negotiations  between  central  and  local  government \nauthorities, and thus could lead to suboptimal outcomes due to poor revenue forecasts \nand  differing  negotiating  capacity  (World  Bank  2014).  The  other  concern  relates  to  \nthe fairness of the system. The shared revenues in Viet Nam are split, based on where \nrevenues  are  actually  collected  rather  than  where  the  tax  is  incurred.  This  raise \nquestions concerning the fairness of the system, especially for the VAT and corporate \nincome  tax  (e.g.,  if  a  firm  operates  in  one  province,  and  its  headquarters  are  in  \nanother province). \n\nSecond,  some  regulations  hinder  the  autonomy  that  the  central  government  gives  to \nprovincial  authorities.  For  example,  with  regard  to  fees  and  user  charges,  provincial \nauthorities can only set the charges and fees for 19 of 63 items, while the Ministry of \nFinance has the authority to set the fees and user charges of the remaining items. This \npartly explains why only about 11% of own-source revenues were collected from fees \nand charges (World Bank 2014). Another regulation is related to the share of resources \nallocated to the commune level: (i) communes and townships receive at least 70% of \nrevenues from a tax on transfer of land-use rights, land and housing taxes, the license \ntax  on  individuals  and  individual  households,  and  registration  fees  for  land  and \nhousing; and (ii) townships and cities receive at least 50% of revenues from registration \nfees, excluding registration fees for land and housing. Such sources of revenue cannot \nbe  reallocated  among  communes,  which  has  caused  vertical  imbalances  among \ncommunes. While many communes and townships cannot absorb the minimum stated \nshares  of  resources,  other  communes  cannot  raise  adequate  resources  to  meet  their \nspending needs. This can lead to inefficient spending or regular carryovers in surplus \njurisdictions, and poorer services delivery in deficit jurisdictions (World Bank 2014). \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 613 \n \n\nMorgan and Long \n\nThird,  the  lack  of  minimum  standard  guidelines  for  services  provision  leads  to \nheterogeneity in responsibility sharing across provinces. For example, some provincial \ngovernments  retain  all  revenue  from  taxes  on  natural  resources,  while  subprovincial \ngovernments (i.e., districts and communes) in other provinces are fully or partly entitled \nto this tax, depending on business ownership. Sharing rates of a revenue source may \neven  vary  among  districts  within  a  province.  For  example,  in  2008,  the  sharing  rates  \nfor  land  and  house  registration  fees  ranged  from  13%  to  38%  among  24  districts  in  \nHo Chi Minh City.  \n\n1.4  Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfers \n\nrevenue-sharing  arrangements  help \n\nimbalances, \nWhile \nintragovernment  fiscal  transfers  aim  to  reduce  horizontal  fiscal  imbalances  and  to \nachieve  national  targets  and  objectives.  At  the  lower  levels  of  government,  revenue \nsharing  and  transfers  are  also  used  to  address  vertical  and  horizontal  imbalances \nacross  districts.  There  are  two  types  of  transfer  program  in  Viet  Nam:  unconditional \nbalancing transfers and targeted transfers.  \n\nreduce  vertical \n\nfiscal \n\nViet  Nam  currently  adopts  two  formulas  to  calculate  balancing  transfers,  one  to \ncalculate  recurrent  spending  needs  and  one  to  estimate  capital  spending  needs.  \nThe  formulas  are  based  on  transfer  norms,  which  are  assigned  based  on  particular \ncriteria,  including  population,  development,  geographic  area,  and  number  of  district \nadministrative  units.  After  subtracting  the  decentralized  revenues  (including  shared \nrevenues), the remaining  amount  is covered  by  the  balancing  transfer.  Because  such \nformulas  are  determined  before  each  stability  period,5 balancing  transfers  are  highly \npredictable, as they are fixed in nominal terms over each stability period. \n\nAt  the  provincial  level,  there  are  allocation  norms  for  spending  estimates  for  districts \nacross 19 categories of expenditure, mostly various functional areas of spending such \nas  education,  health,  and  economic  services.  For  each  functional  area,  a  per  capita \nallocation norm is based on geographic location (e.g., urban, plain areas, mountainous \nareas, and highlands and islands).6  \n\nTable  3  presents the share  of  each revenue  source  in  total  expenditure. On  average, \nthere  has  been  no  significant  change  in  the  role  of  each  source  of  revenue  in  total \nexpenditure,  except  for  the  other  sources  (including  local  government  borrowing). \nDecentralized  revenue  (including  own-source  revenue  and  share  revenue)  still \naccounts  for  65%  of  total  expenditure,  while  total  transfers  (including  balancing \ntransfers  and targeted transfers)  account for  about  40%  of  total  expenditure,  implying \nthe  increasing  importance  of  shared  revenues  in  local  government  revenue  given  the \ndecline in the share of own-source revenue in total local government revenue. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n5  In  the  second  stability  period,  per  capita  norms  were  assigned  in  14  sectors.  The  norms  took  into \naccount the geographic locations of the population within a province. Higher norms were established for \nthose living in remote or mountainous areas, and even higher ones were created for those who live in \nthe  highlands  or  on  islands  to  take  into  account  the  input  price  differences,  economies  of  scale,  and \nnumber of vulnerable populations. \n\n6  For  example,  for  the  health  sector,  urban  areas  are  allocated  VND105,600  per  person  per  year, \nwhereas  mountainous  areas  are  allocated  VND1,986,880  person  per  year.  This  recognizes  different \ncosts of services delivery across different geographic areas. \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 613 \n \n\nMorgan and Long \n\nTable 3: Source of Revenue for Expenditure \n(%) \n\nDecentralized Revenue/ \nTotal Expenditure \n\nBalancing/Total \nExpenditure \n\nTransfer/Total \nExpenditure \n\nOther \nSources \n\n \nAll provinces \n2007 \n2010 \n2013 \nPoorer provinces \n2010 \n2013 \n\n65 \n64 \n66 \n\n31 \n29 \n\n22 \n15 \n23 \n\n19 \n29 \n\n21 \n24 \n18 \n\n28 \n20 \n\n27 \n44 \n37 \n\n7 \n2 \n\nNote: Decentralized revenue includes the own-source revenues and shared revenue. \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation using Ministry of Finance data. \n\nThere is a wide gap in the role of each revenue source in expenditure between better-\noff  provinces  and  poorer  ones.  In  poorer  provinces,  total  transfers  still  account  for \nabout 50% total expenditure, while decentralized revenue makes up only 30%. Table 3 \nshows  that  while  better-off  provinces  have  a  large fiscal  surplus (i.e., their  revenue  is \nalways  much  higher  than  their  expenditure),  poorer  provinces  do  not  have  enough \nresources  for  their  spending,  even  after  receiving  intergovernmental  transfers.  This \ngreatly increases the pressure on these provinces to run budget deficits.  \n\nFigure 3: Budget Deficits over Time and the Role of Fiscal Transfers \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations using Ministry of Finance data. \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 613 \n \n\nMorgan and Long \n\nFigure 3 presents fiscal gaps among provinces. Before transfers, budget deficits seem \nto  widen  over  time.  Deficits  seem,  however,  to  be  driven  by  budget  deficits  in  poorer \nprovinces where the revenue per capital is much lower than the expenditure per capita \nand  the  growth  of  expenditure  per  capital  is  higher  than  that  of  revenue  per \nexpenditure.  After  transfers,  on  average,  there  is  a  slight  fiscal  surplus.  In  poorer \nprovinces,  fiscal  deficits,  however,  are  still  observed,  indicating  a  growing  vertical \nimbalance  across  provinces.  In  2012,  more  than  58%  of  provinces  that  had  100% \nretained revenue could only finance less than 20% of decentralized expenditure, while \nthe  corresponding  figure  for  2007  was  about  46%.  This  is  due  in  part  to  the  rise  in \nspending responsibilities assigned to local authorities and inelasticity of 100% retained \nrevenue with respect to nominal GDP (World Bank 2014).  \n\nAt the lower levels of government, imbalances are more severe within provinces than \nacross  provinces.  In  many  provinces,  by  the  end  of  2011,  more  than  75%  of  district \nexpenditure  was  covered  by  other  sources  of  finance  rather  than  100%  retained \nrevenue.  Similarly,  in  many  districts,  less  than  12%  of  district  core  spending  was \ncovered by 100% retained revenue in 2011, while this figure was around 20% in 2006. \nThis  is  partly  due  to  an  increase  in  spending  responsibility  decentralization  (World \nBank 2014). \n\nThe  system  of  central  targeted  transfers  to  local  authorities  is  conditional  grants \nthrough  which  the  central  government  aims  to  achieve  socioeconomic  development \ntargets. There are two types of target programs: national target programs (NTPs) and \nother target transfers (i.e., conditional transfers). \n\nNTPs  aim  to  accelerate  progress  toward  national  sociodevelopment  objectives, \ncovering  a  wide  range  of  objectives  aimed  at  poverty,  education,  health,  livelihoods, \nrural  development,  culture,  energy  use,  and  climate  change.  The  Ministry  of  Finance \nand  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment  have  overall  responsibility  for  financing \ndecisions  and  monitoring  across  all  NTPs.  Line  ministries,  which  are  assigned  key \nroles  in  developing  NTPs,  are  responsible  for  budget  allocations  to  and  oversight  of \nNTPs.  Various  line  ministries  may  also  be  involved  if  NTPs  cover  more  than  one \nsector. Currently, there are 16 NTPs.  \n\nOther  target  transfer  programs  cover  a  wide  range  of  objectives  including  capital \ninvestment, infrastructure investment, and economic development programs in specific \nregions. Although during last decade this type of target transfer became less important, \nit  still  accounted  for  about  25%  of  local  spending  during  2006\u20132011,  suggesting  that \nlocal authorities are less dependent on nondiscretionary resources.  \n\nfor  proposing  activities  and \n\nLocal  governments  are  responsible \nimplementing \nassociated programs at the local level. They prepare proposals, then discuss them with \ncentral  government  agencies,  who  in  turn  submit  the  financial  proposal,  including \nallocation  to  provinces,  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Ministry  of  Planning  and \nInvestment. Implementation must follow regulations set out by the central government \nagencies.  The  allocation  of  NTP  resources  is  based  on  a  set  of  eligibility  criteria  in \nrelevant  Prime  Minister\u2019s  decisions  and  accompanying  circulars,  which  mainly \nconstitute socioeconomic indicators. \n\nIn  general,  Viet  Nam\u2019s  intragovernment  fiscal  transfer  system  works  effectively  to \nreduce fiscal disparities across jurisdictions. The final distributions of expenditures per \ncapita  both  across  and  within  provinces  are  fairly  equalized  (World  Bank  2014). \nNonetheless,  there  are  some  institutional  issues  that  may  hinder  the  effectiveness  of \nsuch a system. First, the transfer amount is determined in the first years of a stability \nperiod and remains constant in nominal terms over the whole period. For some richer \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 613 \n \n\nMorgan and Long \n\nprovinces, local revenue increases could cover such shortages in real terms, but some \npoorer provinces suffer from the loss in real terms.  \n\nSecond,  there  are  some  weaknesses  in  the  transfer  norms.  For  example,  in  the \neducation sector, the norms use the number of school-aged children instead of enrolled \npupils, discouraging provinces that have low rates of school enrollment from increasing \nenrollment rates. Third, there are some incentive problems due to the right to have full \nresponsibility for resources allocation within assigned resources at the provincial level. \nWhile most provinces use national transfer norms for allocating recurrent expenditure, \nsome provinces design their own, creating incentive issues. For instance, while central \nnorms for health are based on population, norms adopted in some provinces are based \non permanent health care staff or physical endowment, thus encouraging district health \nsectors  to  expand  their  staff  or  benefiting  disproportionately  those  places  that  are \nalready  better  equipped,  and/or  creating  incentives  to  maintain  inefficient  health  care \nfacilities  (Le  2006).  Management  costs  could  also  increase  due  to  diversified  sources \nof funding for NTPs. Around 56% of funding for all NTPs during 2012\u20132013 came from \ncentral  authorities,  26%  from  local  authorities,  5%  from  external  donors,  4%  from \nborrowing,  and  9% from  community  contributions  (World  Bank  2014).  Each  NTP  may \ncomply with some financial management rules and procedures. \n\nFourth,  there  is  a  huge  gap  between  estimated  budgets  and  realized  budgets.  It  is \nestimated  that  the  realized  budget  is  usually  175%  larger  than  the  estimated  one, \nimplying a lack of predictability in NTPs (World Bank 2014), ultimately impacting fiscal \nmanagement.  Further,  it  puts  pressure  on  local  government  budgets  and  leads  to  a \nproliferation  of  unfunded  mandates.  In  fact,  many  local  government  authorities  claim \nthat national programs and policies are not always accompanied by adequate or timely \nfinancing  (World  Bank  2014).  Under  such  cases,  local  governments  either  stop \nimplementing NTPs or use their limited resources to implement the programs and seek \nreimbursement later.  \n\nFifth, targets set in NTPs are ambiguous, and targets and resourcing are misaligned. A \nnumber of local authorities have argued that the targets set in NTPs are too ambitious \nand  do  not  take  into  account  costs  and  fiscal  sustainability  at  the  local  government \nlevel (World Bank 2014). Moreover, funding is also not conditional on outputs under the \nprograms.  In  addition,  capital  projects  developed  under  NTPs  lack  operations  and \nmaintenance resources, hurting the sustainability of the NTP targets.  \n\nSix,  it  is  difficult  for  local  authorities  to  coordinate  so  many  target  programs,  partly \nbecause the  number  of programs  is  high,  and  national  and even  subnational  steering \ncommittees are ineffective. The total number of target transfer schemes is 44, and the \nnumber  of  programs  is  even  higher  if  province-level  target  programs  are  taken  into \naccount. The targets set out in such programs overlap (World Bank 2014). Meanwhile, \nthe  ineffectiveness  of  national,  and  in  some  cases  subnational,  steering  committees \nthat  have  been  established  to  help  coordinate  NTP  planning  and  budgeting  have \nresulted in fragmentation and weak monitoring and evaluation.  \n\nIn  summary,  the  revenue  side  of  subnational  government  budgets  remains,  in  many \nrespects,  highly  centralized.  The  tax  rates  and  bases  of  taxes,  both  shared  and \nexclusive to subnational government, are determined centrally. Provinces do, however, \nhave the authority to set rates for a few local charges and fees and to determine how to \nallocate  their  revenues  within  their  jurisdictions.  Furthermore,  despite  the  new  budget \nlaw,  some  provinces  use  mechanisms  contrary  to  the  law,  suggesting  that  de  facto \ndecentralization is somewhat greater than legally sanctioned.  \n\n \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 613 \n \n\nMorgan and Long \n\n1.5  Local Government Borrowing \n\nLocal  borrowing  has  emerged  as  an  important  topic  in  Viet  Nam,  particularly  for \nprovinces  that  are  unable  to  satisfy  their  capital  spending  needs  through  existing  \nlocal  revenue  and  transfers.  The  current  system  is  geared  to  redistributing  locally \ncollected  revenues,  the  bulk  of  which  is  contributed  by  a  handful  of  provinces  such  \nas  Ho  Chi  Minh  City,  Hanoi,  and  Binh  Duong,  and  have  highlighted  significant \ninfrastructure financing deficits.  \n\nThe new budget law and Public Debt Management Law 2009 stipulate the golden rule \n(i.e., provincial governments cannot borrow to meet recurrent expenditures). Borrowing \nis solely for capital investment projects that can generate returns to service debt. These \nlaws  also  place  a  ceiling  on  local  outstanding  debt  at  30%  of  a  province\u2019s  annual \ncapital budget, except for Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, where the ceiling is set at 100% \nof  the  annual  capital  budget.  The  government\u2019s  public  debt  management  strategy, \n2012 set a ceiling of 3% of GDP for all local government debt and a ceiling of 65% of \nGDP for total public and publicly guaranteed debt including local debt. \n\nTable 4: Summary of Different Sources and Types of Local Borrowing \n\nRegulations \n\nConstraints \n\nType of Borrowing \nLocal government \nbonds \n\nLoans from \ncommercial banks \n\nBorrowing from the \nState Treasury \n\nBoth the amount and rate of \nborrowings are controlled.

Due to the borrowing \nceilings  imposed  under  the  new  budget  law,  local  authorities  can  also  turn  to  other \nforms  of  borrowing,  such  as  local  infrastructure  development  funds  and  overseas \ndevelopment assistance (as onlent by central government), which are not subject to the \nsame limits. Local governments do not have direct access to financing from the central \nbank. In terms of administrative procedure, provincial borrowings are subject to various \napproval procedures depending on the utilization of fund and instruments, as stipulated \nby Public Debt Management Law 2009 and other secondary regulations. In general, all \nborrowings  have  to  be  inspected  and  approved  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  other \ncentral government agencies where applicable. \n\nThus,  borrowing  by  local  authorities  remains  very  low.  During  the  past  10  years, \nsubnational  debt  was  kept  below  3%  of  GDP  and  financed  only  4%  of  development \nexpenditures. However, in 2011, around 13 provinces exceeded their outstanding debt \nstock limits of 30% of annual capital budget. Debt in some provinces was twice as high \nas the limit (World Bank 2014).  \n\nAlthough  nearly  all  provinces  have  engaged  in  some  form  of  debt  financing,  the \n10 largest  borrowers  represented  more  than  two-thirds  of  subnational  borrowing  in \n2012 (Figure 5). The total subnational debt was also concentrated in these cities (42% \nof  total  local  debt  in  2012),  but  even  within  this  group,  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  dominated, \naccumulating 38% of the total local debt (World Bank 2014) (Box). \n\n \n\n \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 613 \n \n\nMorgan and Long \n\nFigure 5: Share of Local Government Debt by Province \n(%) \n\nHCMC = Ho Chi Minh City. \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation using Ministry of Finance data. \n\n \n\nDebt Sustainability in Ho Chi Minh City \n\nHo  Chi  Minh  City  is  the  largest  economic  hub  in  Viet  Nam,  with  relatively  strong  local \nrevenue mobilization. More than half of local financing (inclusive  of new debt flows) comes \nfrom  decentralized  revenues.  The  ratio  of  decentralized  revenue  to  local  recurrent \nexpenditure  averaged  around  200%  during  2006\u20132011.  Of  total  expenditure,  capital \ninvestment made up 40%\u201350% during 2006\u20132011. The city\u2019s budget deficit is low, at about \n0.1% of its gross  domestic product (GDP),  and borrowing  is also  low.  By  the  end  of  2013, \ntotal outstanding debt from bond issuances was an estimated VND11.6 trillion, equal to 1.5% \nof local GDP and 49.0% of the capital budget in 2013. The average interest rate was 7% for \n3-year maturity, 6% for 5-year maturity, and 5% for 10-year maturity.  \n\nTwo  ratios  are  used  as  measures  of  debt  burden:  (i)  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  debt  stock  to  GDP \n(threshold  of  25%  to  assess  solvency);  and  (ii)  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  debt  service  to  local \nrevenue  (threshold  of  25%  to  assess  liquidity).  The  thresholds  are  benchmarks  and  not  \nstrict ceilings.  \n\nFor the baseline scenario, it is assumed that, in the medium term, economic indicators used \nin  estimations  (i.e.,  GDP  growth,  inflation,  revenue  and  expenditure  growth,  and  interest \nrate) are  lower than  during 2006\u20132011 but they  will return to their  2006\u20132011 levels in the \nlong term. Under this scenario, city debts can be viewed as sustainable, with a manageable \ndebt stock\u2013GDP ratio. However, city authorities should recognize liquidity pressures and the \ngrowing share of interest payments in total recurrent spending. \n\nLiquidity pressure would be more obvious if a low scenario occurs. In this scenario, growth \nslows to 5% per year over the medium term and gradually stabilizes to below the historical \naverage  of  8%  over  the  long  term,  decentralized  revenue  growth  falls  by  nearly  one-third, \nand  expenditures  remain  the  same.  Debt  service  requirements  are  likely  to  crowd  out \nrecurrent expenditures. The debt service\u2013revenue ratio exceeds the threshold for almost the \nentire projection period; consequently, the golden rule will be broken over the long term. \n\nUnder  a  scenario  that  economic  conditions  become  more  favorable  than  the  baseline \nscenario (e.g., a higher growth rate, higher revenue, and expenditure growth), the city would \nmore  than  meet  its  capital  spending  needs  and  maintain  sustainable  levels  of  debt  with \nstronger growth and revenue mobilization.  \n\nSource: World Bank (2014). \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 613 \n \n\nMorgan and Long \n\nThe  ratio  of  local  government  borrowing  to  total  local  government  revenue  was  4.0%  \nin  2007  and  2.4%  in  2012.  According  to  the  World  Bank  (2014),  local  government \nborrowing tended to be higher in more developed, more fiscally autonomous, and more \nfiscally  sustainable  provinces.  A  higher  borrowing  level  was  also  associated  with  a \nhigher share of spending in local expenditure. Therefore, although borrowing levels are \ngenerally  low,  they  seem  consistent  with  the  level  of  local  development,  capital \nspending needs, and fiscal sustainability trends. \n\n1.6  Fiscal Sustainability in Local Governments \n\nThe  World  Bank  (2014)  identified  three  sources  of  contingent  liabilities  in  Viet  Nam: \npublic financial funds (PFFs), local SOEs, and banking sector stress.  \n\nCurrently,  Viet  Nam  has  more  than  30  central  and  local  PFFs  whose  nature,  scope, \nand  scale  of  operations  are  diverse.  Among  these  PFFs,  only  some  specific  central-\nlevel funds and local development investment funds have their own sources of revenue \nand  expenditure  mandates,  and  account  for  95%  of  total  expenditure  of  PFFs.  The \nother local-level PFFs are small and operate mostly within provinces. Although most of \nthese PFFs are dependent on either the central or local government budgets for their \ninitial, and even operational capital (except for some funds that can mobilize revenues \nfrom beneficiaries such as health insurance and social insurance funds), their financial \nreports have never been incorporated into the annual budget and budget final account \ndocuments (World Bank 2014). \n\nCurrently,  there  are  28  operating  local  development  investment  funds  (LDIFs),  which \ncould  be  viewed  as  special  purpose  vehicles.  These  LDIFs  are  the  largest  PFFs \noperating  at  the  local  level.  Legally,  they  are  commercially  oriented  state  financial \ninstitutions,  are  allowed  to  raise  medium-  and  long-term  capital,  and  can  invest  in  \ncost-recovery infrastructure projects. Their responsibility includes undertaking financial \nand development investments. Such types of special purpose vehicles have expanded \nconsiderably in Viet Nam and have mobilized a huge amount of funds for infrastructure \ninvestment. According to the World Bank (2014), the average annual growth rate of the \noperational capital of these funds was high at 40% during 2005\u20132011.  \n\nLDIFs  also  engage  in  short-term  borrowing  on  a  rollover  basis  from  state-owned \ncommercial  banks  (SOCBs)  and  other  SOEs.  These  short-term  borrowings  can  lead  \nto  short-term-oriented  investments,  potentially  re-allocating  LDIF  capital  away  from \nlong-term  infrastructure  development.  Inappropriate  borrowing  by  the  LDIFs  can  also \nhave a negative effect on the developing banking sector. \n\nThe  second  source  of  contingent  liabilities  in  Viet  Nam  is  local  SOEs.  There  are \n1,506 local  SOEs  and  982  public  service  enterprises.  Due to their  nature,  these firms \nhave  easier  access  to  commercial  loans,  especially  from  SOCBs.  This  has  led  to  an \nincreasing accumulation of debt of these firms. The World Bank (2014) estimated that \nmore  than  half  of  about  US$3.5  billion  of  infrastructure  financing  from  SOCBs  was \nmade  to  SOEs.  These  firms  also  have  easier  access  to  onlent  government  external \nloans.  For  example,  by  2012,  public  service  enterprises  in  water  management  and \nsanitation  had  total  debt  from  onlent  government  external  loans  of  US$360  million \n(VND7.56  trillion)  (World  Bank  2014).  By  law,  these  firms  are  financially  independent \nfrom the agencies that have ownership rights over the firms. Yet in reality, if SOEs and \npublic service enterprises get into trouble, they seek the support from their agencies to \ncoordinate the debt workout.  \n\n \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 613 \n \n\nMorgan and Long \n\nLocal  authorities  in  recent  years  have  accumulated  payment  arrears  to  construction \nfirms, which, in turn, has prevented these firms from servicing their debts and has led \nto  growing  nonperforming  loans  in  local  banking  systems.  According  to  the  National \nAudit  Agency,  by  the  end  of  2011,  total  debts  to  construction  companies  by  local \ngovernments amounted to VND91,273 billion.7 There were 15 provinces with payment \narrears  larger  than  100%  of  planned  capital  expenditure.  The  Ministry  of  Finance \nargues  that  this  was  in  part  due  to  loose  commitment  controls,  which  led  local \nauthorities  to  enter  into  arrangements  with  civil  works  contractors  without  adequate \nbudget authority. \n\nLocal government borrowing is not included in the budget balance, thus not accounted \nfor  in  the  local  budget  balance.  This  could  be  viewed  as  the  consequence  of \nrequirements  regarding  maintaining  a  balanced  budget  at  the  local  government  level, \nand exclusion of local budget deficits in the overall state budget deficit.  \n\nCurrent regulations relating to subnational borrowings may not reflect the ability of the \nlocal authorities to repay debts. The World Bank (2014) argued that it is hard to figure \nout the long-term creditworthiness of a province when looking at figures relating to debt \nstock and annual capital budget. In other words, local government borrowing does not \nnecessarily reflect local government fiscal capacity. In 2011, many provinces, including \nthose  with  less  fiscal  capacity,  had  borrowing  much  higher  than  the  borrowing  ceiling \n(World Bank 2014). Another issue is that, under current regulations, local government \nborrowing  does  not  cover  guarantees  and  other  contingent  liabilities.  This  makes  the \nfigures on local government borrowing not reliable and hard to enforce.  \n\nThe ceiling on local government debt does not create proper incentives for borrowers. \nThe World Bank (2014) pointed out that the total amount of debt stock, which does not \nreflect  the  actual  obligations  for  repaying  the  principal  and  interest,  is  not  a  good \nindicator since it does not reflect the actual debt burden faced by the local government. \nThis, in turn, will cause difficulty in estimating the debt obligations in the future. In fact, \ncompliance  with  debt  limits  in  a  particular  year  does  not  automatically  ensure  that  a \nlocal authority will be able to repay its debt in the long term. \n\nCurrently,  there  is  no  formal  requirement  on  reporting  and  disclosure  of  local  debt  to \nthe  public.  Usually,  such  information  is  required  to  be  reported  to  the  Banking  and \nFinance  Department  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance. 8 This  limits  the  development  of  the \nlocal  government  bond  market  since  private  investors  have  little  information  on  the \nlocal authorities and cannot assess the creditworthiness of the local government fiscal \nstance. Reports from local authorities, when received, are usually late and not detailed, \nwhile processing such information is time-consuming since each province has its own \nreporting format. \n\n2.  EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF DEFICIT SUSTAINABILITY \n\nIN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS \n\nIn  this  section,  the  deficit  sustainability  of  local  governments  in  Viet  Nam  is  analyzed \nusing  two  estimation  methods.  First,  fully  modified  ordinary  least  squares  (OLS)  is  \nused to estimate the long-term correlations between the co-integration equation, which \nincludes  the  vector  of  co-integration  variables  and  stochastic  regressor  innovations. \n                                                \n7  Tuoitre  Online.  2013.  Gi\u1eadt  M\u00ecnh  V\u1edbi  91.000  T\u1ec9  D\u1ed3ng  N\u1ee3  D\u1ecdng.  9  September.  Available  \n(accessed  \n\nat  http://tuoitre.vn/tin/kinh-te/20130909/giat-minh-voi-91000-ti-dong-no-dong/567953.html \n26 September 2016). \n\n8  The Public Debt Bulletin is a consolidated debt bulletin produced by the Ministry of Finance. \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 613 \n \n\nMorgan and Long \n\nThe panel nature of the data takes into account the cross-sectional heterogeneity at the \nprovincial  level.  The  analytical  framework  is  based  on  Buettner  and  Wildasin  (2006), \nBuettner (2009), Sol\u00e9\u2013Oll\u00e9 and Sorribas\u2013Navarro (2012), and Bessho (2016). Denoting \nown-source  revenue  as  Rit,  total  local  government  expenditure  as  Eit,  and  balancing \ntransfer as Tit, their relations are presented as  \n\n or \n\n \n\n(1) \n\n\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 \u2212 \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\n\n\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 \u2212 \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\nIf uit is stationary, and if Rit, Eit, and Tit are integrated of order 1, then these variables \nare  co-integrated  with  co-integration  vector  [1,-\u03b1,  +\u03b2].  In  this  case,  we  can  estimate  \nthe  above  equation  using  the  fully  modified  OLS  for  co-integrated  variables.  Some \nimplications  can  be  inferred  from  this  test:  (i)  if  uit  is  stationary,  then  the  local \ngovernment  fiscal  deficit  is  not  explosive  in  the  long  term;  and  (ii)  if  \u03b1>1,\uf020(i.e.,  a  1% \nincrease in expenditure will increase revenue by more than 1%), then this will support \nthe  fiscal  sustainability  of  local  governments.  To  account  for  population  differences \namong  provinces,  the  above  approach  is  also  used  with  a  vector  of  four  variables:  \nown-source revenue per capita, expenditure per capita, GDP per capita, and balancing \ntransfer per capita.  \n\nSecond, to further examine fiscal sustainability at the provincial level, based upon the \nBohn (2008) model, this fiscal reaction equation is used: \n\n\u2019\n\n \n\n\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udefc5 + \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udf16\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udf17\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\n\n\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 =   \ud835\udefc0 + \ud835\udefc1\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\u22121 + \ud835\udefc2\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udefc3\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udefc4\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 +\n\ud835\udc4b\n\n \nwhere Surplusit is the primary surplus of province i at time t, GDPgapit is the GDP gap, \nEXPgapit  is  the  expenditure  gap,  BTit  is  the  share  of  balancing  transfer  in  total \nexpenditure,  Xit  is  a  vector  of provincial  characteristics,  \u03c0  is fixed  province  effect,  \u03b5t  is \nthe fixed time effect, and \u03c5it is the error term.  \n\n(2)\n\nSurplus  is  calculated  as  the  ratio  of  fiscal  surplus  to  GDP.  Fiscal  surplus  is  the \ndifference  between  local  government  revenue  and  local  government  expenditure. \nBalancing transfer and targeted transfer in local government revenue are not included. \nThe GDP gap is the difference between the realized GDP and trend values of GDP or \ndeviation of GDP from its trend.  \n\nSimilar to Bohn (2008), a positive value of the GDP gap implies that the realized GDP \nis higher than its trend value. Similarly, the expenditure gap is the difference between \nthe  realized  expenditure  and  its  trend  at  the  provincial  level.  A  positive  value  of  the \nexpenditure  gap  implies  that  the  realized  expenditure  is  higher  than  its  trend.  Both \ntrend  values  are  calculated  by  using  the  Hodrick\u2013Prescott  filter  using  a  smoothing \nparameter  of  10,000.  Therefore,  the  expenditure  gap  is  expected  to  have  a  negative \ninfluence  on  the  fiscal  surplus,  and  the  output  gap  variable  is  expected  to  have  a \npositive  influence  on the fiscal  surplus.  If output is  below  its trend,  the surplus  should \ndecrease.  Similarly,  if  government  spending  is  above  its  trend,  the  surplus  should \ndecrease. To examine how the fiscal deficit at the central government level may have \nimplications for local government fiscal surplus, the share of balancing transfer in total \nexpenditure  is  used.  The  more  a  province  is  dependent  on  balancing  transfers,  it  is \nexpected that the less fiscal surplus it will enjoy. \n\nInstead of using data compiled by provinces due to missing data (i.e., some provinces \ndo  not  publish  their  fiscal  data  in  some  years),  data  consolidated  by  the  Ministry  of \nFinance  are  used.  These  data,  however,  do  not  categorize  expenditure  and  revenue \nitems  at  the  provincial  level.  To  account  for  different  fiscal  capacities,  in  some \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 613 \n \n\nMorgan and Long \n\nestimations,  the  sample  is  divided  into  two  groups:  (i)  provinces  for  which  the  share \nrate  is  100%  (i.e.,  poorer  provinces);  and  (ii)  provinces  with  sharing  rates  lower  than \n100% (i.e., better-off provinces).  \n\nTo  avoid  spurious  regressions,  this  study  examines  whether  the  panel  data  are \nstationary by using panel unit root tests (Levin, Lin, James\u2013Chu 2002; Breitung 2002; \nIm, Pesaran, Shin 2003) and Fisher-type tests using Augment Dickey\u2013Fuller (ADF) and \nPhillips\u2013Perron (PP) tests (Maddala and Wu 1999). Levin, Lin, James\u2013Chu (2002) and \nBreitung (2002) models were based on the ADF test and assumed homogeneity in the \ndynamics  of  the  autoregressive  coefficients  for  all  panel  units  with  cross-sectional \nindependence,  while  Im  et  al.  (2003);  Fisher\u2013ADF;  and  Fisher\u2013PP  tests  allow  for \nheterogeneity in the autoregressive coefficients for all panel members. The alternative \nhypothesis  simply  implies  that  some  or  all  of  the  individual  series  are  stationary.  The \npanel unit root results are presented in Table 5.  \n\nThere  is  a  large  difference  in  the  test  results.  While  under  the  assumption  of \nhomogeneity  in  the  dynamic  of  autoregressive  coefficients,  Levin,  Lin,  James\u2013Chu \n(2002) and Breitung (2002) show that there is no unit root in individual variables, while \nIm,  Pesaran,  Shin  (2003);  Fisher\u2013ADF;  and  Fisher\u2013PP  tests  show  that  all  variables \nhave unit roots at the level and no unit root at the first difference. Because the sample \nincludes all provinces in the country, heterogeneity is surely present. Therefore, it can \nbe concluded that there are unit roots for the data in the level and no unit root for data \nat the first difference. \n\nNull Hypothesis \n\nStatistics \n\nLevel \nLocal government expenditure \nLocal government revenue \nBalance transfer \nLocal government expenditure  \nper capita \nLocal government revenue  \nper capita \nLocal GDP per capita \nBalance transfer per capita \n\nFirst difference \nLocal government expenditure \nLocal government revenue \nBalance transfer \nLocal government expenditure  \nper capita \nLocal government revenue  \nper capita \nLocal GDP per capita \nBalance transfer per capita \n\nTable 5: Panel Unit Root Test \n\nUnit Root  \n(assumes common  \nunit root process) \n\nUnit Root  \n(assumes individual  \nunit root process) \n\nBreitung \n\nIm, Pesaran, \nShin  \n\nADF\u2013\nFisher \n\nLevin, Lin, \nJames\u2013Chu \n \n\n \n\n\u20135.81*** \n\u20137.55*** \n\u201317.24*** \n\u20134.72*** \n\n\u20134.30*** \n\u20133.15*** \n\u20130.35 \n\u20134.74*** \n\n \n\n1.15 \n\u20131.05 \n\u20131.59 \n1.84 \n\n \n126.93 \n130.90 \n133.65 \n120.46 \n\nPP\u2013\nFisher \n\n \n128.24 \n225.90*** \n118.35 \n115.58 \n\n\u20138.29*** \n\n\u20132.40*** \n\n\u20131.27 \n\n136.70 \n\n222.90*** \n\n\u20134.85*** \n\u201319.58*** \n\n \n\n\u20139.28*** \n\u20131.05 \n\u201321.66*** \n\u20137.14*** \n\n1.52 \n\u20130.55 \n\n \n\n\u20132.16*** \n\u201310.01*** \n\u201314.80*** \n\u20132.48*** \n\n1.16 \n\u20132.14** \n\n \n\n\u20135.66*** \n\u20133.75*** \n\u201310.96*** \n\u20135.67*** \n\n106.30 \n138.27 \n\n \n222.36*** \n174.92*** \n337.30*** \n222.48*** \n\n95.50 \n134.62 \n\n \n666.58*** \n833.69*** \n638.29*** \n688.28*** \n\n\u20130.52 \n\n\u201310.18*** \n\n\u20133.52*** \n\n169.16*** \n\n821.24*** \n\n\u201313.65*** \n\u201321.94*** \n\n\u20133.55*** \n\u201314.68*** \n\n\u20134.84*** \n\u201311.33*** \n\n202.40*** \n345.62*** \n\n378.90*** \n641.05*** \n\nADF = Augment Dickey\u2013Fuller; PP = Phillips\u2013Perron; GDP = gross domestic product. \n\nNote: * p<0.1, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01. \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 613 \n \n\nMorgan and Long \n\nAfter testing for unit roots, co-integration among the variables of interest is investigated. \nPedroni  (2000)  proposed  a  methodology  to  test  for  panel  data  co-integration,  which \nallows testing for the co-integrated relationship in four different models: model without \nheterogeneous  trend  and  ignoring  common  time  effect  (M1),  model  without  common \ntime  effect  and  allowing  heterogeneous  trend  (M2),  model  with  heterogeneous  trend \nand  allowing  common  time  effect  (M3),  and  model  with  common  time  effect  and \nignoring  heterogeneous  trend  (M4).  Pedroni  (1999)  showed  that  there  are  seven \ndifferent statistics for the co-integration test: panel v-statistic, panel \u03c1\u03c1-statistic, Pedroni \nPanel-statistic,  panel  ADF-statistic,  group  rho-statistic,  group  Pedroni  Panel-statistic, \nand  group  ADF-statistic.  The  first  four  statistics  are  known  as  panel  co-integration \nstatistics  and  are  based  on  the  within-dimension  approach.  The  last  three  statistics  \nare  group  panel  co-integration  statistics  and  are  based  on  the  between-dimension \napproach.  In  the  presence  of  a  co-integrating relationship, the residuals are  expected \nto be stationary. \n\nTable 6: Panel Co-Integration Test \n\nPanel A: Model 1  \n(local government expenditure, local government revenue, balancing transfer) \nPedroni Residual Co-Integration Test (H0: no co-integration) \n\nTrend Assumption \n\nStatistic \n\nProb. \n\nStatistic \n\nProb. \n\nDrift and No Deterministic \nTrend \n\nDrift and Deterministic \nIntercept \n\n \n\n \n\nH1: Common AR coefficients (within-dimension) \n2.739 \nPanel v-Statistic \n\u20132.155 \nPanel rho-Statistic \n\u201314.653 \nPanel Pedroni Panel-Statistic \nPanel ADF-Statistic \n\u20134.272 \nH1: Individual AR coefficients (between-dimension) \n2.029 \nGroup rho-Statistic \n\u201321.255 \nGroup Pedroni Panel-Statistic \nGroup ADF-Statistic \n\u20134.316 \nKao Residual Co-Integration Test \nADF \n\n\u20135.711 \n\nPanel B: Model 2  \n(local government expenditure per capita, local government revenue per capita,  \nbalancing transfer per capita, GDP per capita) \nPedroni Residual Co-Integration Test (H0: no co-integration) \n\nTrend Assumption \n\nStatistic \n\nProb. \n\nStatistic \n\nProb. \n\nDrift and No Deterministic \nTrend \n\nDeterministic Intercept \nand Trend \n\n \n\n \n\n0.003 \n0.016 \n0.000 \n0.000 \n\n0.979 \n0.000 \n0.000 \n \n0.000 \n\n0.995 \n0.946 \n0.000 \n0.000 \n\n1.000 \n0.000 \n0.000 \n \n0.000 \n\n\u20131.940 \n2.176 \n\u201314.758 \n\u20131.489 \n \n\n5.584 \n\u201322.822 \n\u20131.636 \n \n \n\n\u20136.334 \n5.057 \n\u201314.350 \n\u20139.160 \n \n\n8.309 \n\u201336.478 \n\u20139.523 \n \n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n0.974 \n0.985 \n0.000 \n0.068 \n\n1.000 \n0.000 \n0.051 \n\n1.000 \n1.000 \n0.000 \n0.000 \n \n1.000 \n0.000 \n0.000 \n \n \n\nH1: Common AR coefficients (within-dimension) \n\u20132.562 \nPanel v-Statistic \n1.611 \nPanel rho-Statistic \n\u201311.122 \nPanel Pedroni Panel-Statistic \nPanel ADF-Statistic \n\u20138.975 \nH1: individual AR coefficients (between-dimension) \n5.655 \nGroup rho-Statistic \n\u201331.219 \nGroup Pedroni Panel-Statistic \nGroup ADF-Statistic \n\u201310.967 \nKao Residual Co-Integration Test \nADF \n\n\u20137.908 \n\nAR = autoregressive; GDP = gross domestic product; ADF = Augment Dickey\u2013Fuller. \nNote: * p<0.1, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01. \n\n19 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 613 \n \n\nMorgan and Long \n\nPanel  A  of  Table  6  presents  the  result  of  M2  (with  time-effect  and  no-heterogeneous \ntrend)  and  M3  (with  time-effect  and  heterogeneous  trend)  co-integration.  For  the  first \nvector  of  the  variable,  six  statistics  from  the  M2  co-integration  test  strongly  reject  the \nnull-hypothesis of no co-integration in the sample. Meanwhile, only two statistics from \nthe  M3  co-integration  test  show  a  strong  rejection  of  the  null  hypothesis,  while  two \nstatistics  show  a  weak  rejection  (at  90%  confidence  level).  Although  there  are  mixed \nresults of the co-integration of the variables, it is hard to accept the null hypothesis that \nthere is no unit root in the data.  \n\nPanel  B  of  Table  6  reports  the  results  of  the  co-integration  test  for  the  vector  of  four \nvariables:  expenditure  per  capita,  revenue  per  capita,  balancing  transfer  per  capita, \nand  GDP  per  capita.  The  results  indicate  that  in  both  cases  (with-  and  without-\nheterogeneous  trends), four  of  the seven  statistics  show  a  strong  rejection  of the  null \nhypothesis  that  there  is  no  panel  co-integration  among  the  sample,  so  the  null \nhypothesis of no co-integration among the four variables can be accepted.  \n\nFollowing Pedroni (2004), the long-term relationship between the co-integrated variable \nis  estimated  by  using  the  fully  modified  OLS  estimator  to  avoid  the  bias  of  the  OLS \nestimator  (Table  7).  The  fully  modified  OLS  results  indicate  that  the  coefficients  \nof  local  government  expenditure  in  all  specifications  are  statistically  significant.  The \nestimation  results  from  the  fully  modified  OLS  panel  estimation  indicate  that  a  1% \nincrease  in  expenditure  leads  to  an  increase  of  local  government  revenue  by  1.45% \n(for  all  provinces)  and  1.60%  (for  poorer  provinces). 9  The  results  support  fiscal \nsustainability  in  the  whole  sample  and  for  the  sample  of  poorer  provinces.  The \nestimation  results  also  indicate  that  balancing  transfers  have  a  negative  relationship \nwith  revenues \ntransfers  may  \ncreate  some  incentive  issues  and  ultimately  discourage  provinces  in  raising  their \nrevenue efforts. \n\nin  poorer  provinces,  suggesting \n\nthat  balancing \n\nThe relationship between three variables is then examined by using expenditure at the \nlocal government level as dependent variables as follows:  \n\n(3) \n\n\ud835\udc52\n\n\ud835\udc52\n\n \n\n\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udefd\n\n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udf0f + \ud835\udefc\n\nIf \u03b1e<1, (i.e.,  a  1%  increase  in  revenue  increases  expenditure  by  less  than  1%), then \nfiscal  sustainability  is  supported.  The  results  in  panel  B  of  Table  7  show  that  the \ncoefficient  of  revenue  in  all  specifications  is  lower  than  1,  supporting  the  results \npresented in panel A with revenue as the dependent variable.  \n\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\n\nTo account for provincial heterogeneity, the long-term relationship is analyzed between \nfour  variables,  revenue  per  capita,  expenditure  per  capita,  provincial  GDP  per  capita, \nand balancing per capita, using the fully modified OLS estimator panel. The results are \nreported  in  panel  C  (with  revenue  per  capita  as  the  dependent  variable)  and  panel  D \n(with  expenditure  per  capita  as  the  dependent  variable).  These  results  support  those \nusing aggregate data. It is interesting to note that local GDP per capita does not have a \nstatistically  significant  effect  on  revenue  per  capita  but  does  have  a  positive  and \nstatistically significant effect on expenditure per capita. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n9   There  is  some  statistical  evidence  indicating  that  the  sample  of  better-off  provinces  is  small  for  this \n\nanalysis, so the estimation with the sample of better-off provinces is not carried out. \n\n20 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 613 \n \n\nMorgan and Long \n\nTable 7: Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares for Co-Integration Relationship \n\nAll Provinces \n\nPoorer Provinces \n\nCoefficient \n\nCoefficient \n\nStandard \nError \n\nStandard \nError \n\n \n\nDependent variable: local government revenue  \nLocal government expenditure \nBalancing transfer \nN*T \nAdjusted R2 \n\n720 \n\n1.453*** \n0.01 \n\n0.881 \n\nDependent variable: local government expenditure \nLocal government revenue \nBalance transfer \nN*T \nAdjusted R2 \n\n720 \n\n0.281 \n\n0.671*** \n0.113*** \n\n \n\n\u20130.083* \n\n1.228*** \n\n0.275*** \n\nDependent variable: local government revenue per capita \nLocal government expenditure per capita \nBalancing transfer per capita \nLocal GDP per capita \nN*T \nAdjusted R2 \n \nDependent variable: local government expenditure per capita \nLocal revenue per capita \nBalancing transfer per capita \nLocal GDP per capita \nN*T \nAdjusted R2 \n\n0.277*** \n\u20130.117** \n0.418*** \n\n0.579 \n\n0.724 \n\n718 \n\n718 \n\nDependent variable: local GDP per capita \nLocal government expenditure per capita \nLocal revenue per capita \nBalancing transfer per capita \nN*T \nAdjusted R2 \n\n0.172*** \n0.052 \n\u20130.057 \n\n719.00 \n\n0.908 \n\nGDP = gross domestic product. \n\nNote: * p<0.1, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01. \n\n0.01 \n0.021 \n\n0.023 \n0.023 \n\n \n \n\n0.047 \n0.048 \n0.041 \n\n0.054 \n0.047 \n0.039 \n\n0.047 \n0.056 \n0.048 \n\n  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.600*** \n\u20130.214*** \n\n588 \n\n0.423 \n\n0.649*** \n0.158*** \n\n588 \n\n0.337 \n\n1.598*** \n\u20130.354*** \n\u20130.124*** \n\n586 \n\n0.496 \n\n0.373*** \n\n\u20130.095* \n\n0.287*** \n\n586 \n\n0.767 \n\n \n\n0.181*** \n0.037 \n\u20130.067 \n\n586.00 \n\n0.845 \n\n0.011 \n0.023 \n \n \n\n \n0.025 \n0.026 \n \n \n\n \n0.053 \n0.054 \n0.045 \n \n \n \n0.06 \n0.056 \n0.043 \n \n \n\n \n0.053 \n0.061 \n0.055 \n \n \n\nTable  8  presents  the  debt  sustainability  analysis.

The estimation results show that the fiscal surplus in \nthe  last  period  has  a  negative  effect  on  the  current  fiscal  surplus,  ensuring  that  the \nfiscal  surplus  is  not  explosive  and  supports  fiscal  sustainability  at  the  local  level.

While the expenditure gap has the expected sign for the specification \nwith  the  whole  sample,  it  has  a  positive  effect  on  fiscal  surplus  for  poorer  provinces. \nThis  suggests  that  provinces  that  suffer  from  expenditure  gaps  may  increase  their \nefforts  to  increase  their  own-source  revenues,  which  could  help  them  cover  gaps  \nin  expenditure  and  accumulate  extra  revenue.  This,  in  turn,  supports  the  previous \nconjecture  that the  balancing transfer  system may  discourage  provinces  in  increasing \ntheir  revenue  efforts.  The  coefficient  on  the  ratio  of  balancing  transfer  to  total \nexpenditure is negative and statistically significant, suggesting that the more dependent \non  government  transfers  a  province  is,  the  higher  the  likelihood  that  it  will  go  \ninto deficit.  \n\n3.  CONCLUSIONS AND SOME POLICY IMPLICATIONS \n\nSince the new budget law was promulgated in 2002, the fiscal responsibilities of local \nauthorities  have  significantly  increased;  thus,  local  fiscal  policies  play  a  large  \nrole  in  Viet Nam\u2019s  growth  and  development.  To  fulfill  their  growing  role,  the  central \ngovernment  has  granted  local  authorities  more  financial  resources,  including  sharing \nparts  of  its  revenue  with  local  governments.  Intergovernmental  fiscal  transfers  have \nalso  been  reformed  to  play  an  important  role  in  mitigating  vertical  and  horizontal  \nfiscal imbalances.  \n\nissues  hinder \n\nthe  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of \n\nHowever,  several \nfiscal \ndecentralization  in  Viet  Nam,  including  unclear  expenditure  assignments  among  tiers  \nof  governments,  various  measures  and  regulations  that  limit  the  autonomy  of  local \ngovernments in carrying out expenditure revenue management, and a lack of minimum \nstandards  for  expenditure  outcomes.  Regarding  intergovernmental  fiscal  transfers, \nalthough  the  transfer  system  is  working  fairly  well,  weaknesses  in  transfer  norms, \nincentive  problems  in  resources  mobilization  and  allocation,  and  existence  of  many \nnational  and  provincial  targeted  programs  with  overlapping  objectives  and  targets  \nalso  limit  the  efficiency  of  this  system.  Local  governments  are  permitted  to  borrow  in \ncapital  markets,  but  it  seems  that  the  fundamental  foundations  for  local  government \nborrowing management are weak. Lack of transparency is also observed in all aspects \nof fiscal decentralization.  \n\nTo make the fiscal decentralization work better in Viet Nam, it is recommended that:  \n\n(i)  The central government should make expenditure assignments more explicit. It \ncould  also  give  up  some  of  its  responsibilities  to  lower  tiers  of  governments. \nThe  central government also  needs to  design minimum  standards  of services \ndelivery,  not  only  to  secure  acceptable  equality  in  services  delivery  across \njurisdictions  but  also  to  provide  local  governments  with  more  autonomy  over \nresources allocation. \n\n(ii)  The  central  government  should  review  its  current  sharing  arrangements  such \nas  using  separate  formulas  for  each  revenue  source  instead  of  using  a \ncommon  formula.  The  central  government  could  further  strengthen  local \ngovernment revenues by allowing provinces to impose surtaxes on some types \nof taxes such as personal income taxes and local business taxes, or by giving \nthem  more  autonomy  in  setting  fees  and  charges.  Introducing  a  property  tax \ncould be considered in the longer term. \n\n23 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 613 \n \n\nMorgan and Long \n\n(iii)  Regarding  intergovernmental  fiscal  transfers,  some  measures  could  be  taken \nimmediately,  such  as  revising  transfer  norms,  adopting  a  formula-based \ntransfer  system,  and  avoiding  negotiations  to  mitigate  incentive  problems  in \nresources allocation.  \n\n(iv)  The  central  and  provincial  governments  should  review  the  current  targeted \nprograms, including objectives and targets, and identify overlapping programs. \nResources allocations for each program should be matched with the targets. In \naddition, financial resources for each program should be linked to outcomes.  \n\n(v)  To  strengthen  the  current  legal  foundations  for  local  government  borrowing, \nareas  that  should  be  emphasized  include  having  a  transparent  reporting \nsystem  for  local  government  debt  reporting,  developing  a  creditworthiness \nevaluation  mechanism  for  local  governments,  and  specifying  a  threshold  on \nlocal debt stocks and debt servicing to ensure debt sustainability. \n\n(vi)  Measures  should  be  created  that  ensure  fiscal  accountability  at  the  local \n\ngovernment level.  \n\n \n\n \n\n24 \n \n\n\fMorgan and Long \n\nADBI Working Paper 613 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nForthcoming. \n\nBessho, S. 2016.

This  study  has  two  objectives:  (i)  to  take  stock  of  the  current  institutional \nframework  for  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations  in  Viet  Nam,  and  (ii)  to  empirically  assess \nthe  debt  sustainability  of  local  governments  in  Viet  Nam.  The  empirical  analysis  uses  two \nestimation methods: (i) fully modified ordinary least squares (OLS) to estimate the long-term \ncorrelations  between  co-integration  equations,  including  vectors  of  co-integration  variables, \nand stochastic regressor innovations; and (ii) fiscal reaction equations at the provincial level, \nbased  upon  the  Bohn  (2008)  model.  The  empirical  results  suggest  that  deficit  levels  are \ngenerally sustainable at the local level. \n \nJEL Classification: H70, H71, H72, H74, H77 \n \n", " \n"]}
