Introduction \nThe microfinance revolution has changed attitudes towards helping the poor in both \nAsia and Latin America, and in some countries has provided substantial flows of credit, \noften to very low-income groups or households, who would normally be excluded by \nconventional financial institutions. Much has been written on the range of institutional \narrangements  pursued  in  different  organizations  and  countries,  and  in  turn  a  vast \nnumber of studies have attempted to assess the outreach and poverty impact of such \nschemes. However, in the academic development community there is a recognition that \nperhaps we know much less about the impact of these programs than might be expected \ngiven the enthusiasm for these activities among donor and policy-making circles. To \nquote a recent authoritative volume on microfinance: \nMFI field operations have far surpassed the research capacity to analyze them, \nso excitement about the use of microfinance for poverty alleviation is not backed \nup with sound facts derived from rigorous research. Given the current state of \nknowledge, it is difficult to allocate confidently public resources to microfinance \ndevelopment. (Zeller and Meyer 2002). \nThis is a very strong statement of doubt. It in part reflects a lack of accurate \ndata, but also in part methodological difficulties associated with assessing exactly what \nproportion of income and other effects on the beneficiaries of micro credit can actually \nbe attributed to the programs themselves. Here we compare poverty impact studies from \nAsia and Latin America.  In particular we examine evidence on three specific issues:  \n\u2212  The success of microfinance programs in reaching the core poor; \n\u2212  The  effectiveness  of  microfinance  initiatives  in  pulling  households  out  of \npoverty; \n\u2212  The cost effectiveness of microfinance as a poverty targeting tool. \n \nThese are very basic questions, and the fact that they can still be posed reflects \nthe extent of uncertainty in the literature.  Since a number of other surveys are also \navailable, we give most attention to evidence produced in the last three or four years1 \nand highlight similarities and differences in microfinance as it has developed in Asia \nand Latin America. \nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a brief overview of \nsome of the distinguishing characteristics of the microfinance industry in Asia and Latin \n                                                 \n1 An earlier helpful survey published by ADBI is Meyer (2002). It draws out some of the methodological \nproblems in assessing impact and surveys a number of important studies available at the time of writing \n(around 2001). Morduch (1999) is an extremely authoritative earlier survey focusing on both conceptual \nand empirical questions. \n 1", "America.  Section 3 discusses the potential for microfinance to combat poverty and \nmethodological issues relating to assessing its success in doing so, and Section 4 goes \non to survey the evidence from selected research studies on this point.  Section 5 \naddresses the question of cost effectiveness.  Finally we draw some brief conclusions. \n2.  Characteristics of Microfinance in Asia and Latin America \nMicrofinance developed in Asia and Latin America under very different ideological, \npolitical  and  economic  conditions.    Hence,  there  are  distinctive  differences  in  the \nindustry in the two regions.  A brief look at the history of two of the most famous \nMFIs\u2014the  Grameen  Bank  in  Bangladesh  and  Banco  Sol  in  Bolivia\u2014gives  an \ninformative picture of how the industry in the two regions can be characterized. \nModern microfinance was born in Bangladesh in the 1970s, in the aftermath of \nthe country\u2019s war of independence, when Muhammad Yunus, an economics professor at \nthe University of Chittagong, began an experimental research project providing credit to \nthe rural poor.  That experiment, driven by a strong sense of developmental idealism, \ndeveloped into what is now the world\u2019s most famous microfinance institution, the \nGrameen Bank, and institutions that replicate its pioneering methodology worldwide. \nMicrofinance in Latin America developed under quite different conditions.  In \nBolivia, a collapsing populist regime led to widespread unemployment.  Banco Sol, a \npioneering microfinance institution in the region, developed to address the problem of \nurban  unemployment  and  provide  credit  to  the  cash-strapped  informal  sector.  The \nnotion of commercial profitability was embraced relatively early in this approach. \nAs a result of the different conditions under which the very first microfinance \ninstitutions (MFIs) were founded, the industry in the two regions developed distinctive \ncharacteristics.    In  the  beginning,  \u201c  by  comparison  with  Bangladesh,  the  Bolivian \nintervention was typically urban rather than rural, less concerned with poverty and more \nfocused on micro-enterprise. It targeted the \u2018economically active poor\u2019\u2014people with \nestablished  businesses  that  needed  capital  to  grow.  \u2026  from  the  start,  Bolivian \nmicrocredit  was  itself  seen  as  a  business,  potentially  as  a  branch  of  commercial \nbanking\u201d  (Rutherford [2003] p.5).  Many of these differences still characterize the \nindustry in the two regions today. \nFor example, data from various sources suggest that Asian MFIs lead the world \nin terms of both breadth (number of clients) and depth (relative poverty of clients) of \noutreach.  In their analysis of over 1,500 MFIs from 85 developing countries, Lapeneu \nand Zeller (2001) find that Asia accounted for the majority of MFIs, retained the highest \nvolume of savings and credit, and served more members than any other continent.  The \nmost  recent  data  from  the Microbanking  Bulletin2,  reinforces  these findings.  The \naverage size of loans and deposits are often taken as a simple proxy of depth of \noutreach.  By these criteria, Asian MFIs have among the lowest Loan and Savings \nBalance per Borrower, even after adjusting for GNP per capita, suggesting that they are \neffectively reaching the poor.   \n                                                 \n2 Microbanking Bulletin reports only data on a limited number of MFIs who choose to participate.  Those \nreporting to the Bulletin are thought to be amongst the best and are therefore unlikely to be representative \nof the industry as a whole (Meyer 2002: 14).    \n 2", "Table 1. Outreach Indicators by Region \n  Average   Average  \nLoan Balance   Saving Balance \nper Borrower (US$) per Saver (US$) \nAfrica  228  105 \nAsia  195  39 \nEastern Europe/Central Asia 590  N/A \nLatin America  581  741 \nMiddle East/  \n286  N/A \nNorth Africa \nSource: Microbanking Bulletin Issue #9, July 2003 \n \n \nThe same data indicate that Latin American MFIs are ahead of Asia in terms of \nfinancial viability.  On average, Latin American MFIs registered with the Microbanking \nBulletin show a higher return than those in Asia. Latin America MFIs are also further \nadvanced in the process of drawing in external funding through savings deposits, with \nregistered institutions on average in the region having a deposit-loan ratio of 29%, \nroughly double the comparable figure for Asia (Ramirez 2004).  \nRegional data of course cover up some wide disparities within each region.  \nMicrofinance is a highly concentrated industry and the giants of the industry\u2014BRI, \nBRAC and ASA\u2014account for more than 50% of the total number of borrowers from \nthe more than 300 MFIs worldwide who report to the MIX Market. BRI alone accounts \nfor nearly 40% of their gross loans. Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, all in \nAsia, have the largest number of members served and the largest distribution of loans \nand mobilization of savings in terms of GNP in the world.  In contrast, the two most \npopulated countries in Asia\u2014India and the PRC\u2014have very low outreach, despite a \nhigh concentration of the region\u2019s poor.  In Latin America, there is very strong skew, \nwith MFIs playing a major role as financial providers to micro-enterprise in Bolivia and \nCentral  America,  but  being  largely  insignificant  in  the  larger  countries  of  Brazil, \nMexico and Argentina.  There is wide disparity in terms of financial viability as well.  \nWithin Latin America there is a wide range, with the larger MFIs showing a return on \nassets in 2001-02 well above the average for the commercial banking sector in their \ncountries, and with the smaller MFIs in the region, on average, operating at a substantial \nfinancial loss when capital costs are calculated at commercial rates. \nThe strong financial performance of the larger MFIs in Latin America is linked \nwith a trend toward commercialization of microfinance in the region.  In 1992, Banco \nSol became the first example of an NGO becoming a commercial bank, and thus \nbecame the first regulated microfinance bank.  Banco Sol surpassed other Bolivian \nbanks in profitability and became the first MFI to access international capital markets.  \nFollowing  this  successful  example,  at  least  39  other  important  NGOs  worldwide \ntransformed themselves into commercial banks over the period 1992\u20132003 (Fernando \n[2003]).  Given that the failure of commercial financial institutions to reach the poor \nprovided the initial impetus for MFIs, this new trend is paradoxical and raises the \nquestion of whether the initial poverty reduction objectives of the transformed NGOs \nwill be subjugated to commercial criteria (so-called \u2018mission drift\u2019). This potential \n 3", "disadvantage is still unexplored empirically, but the advantages of transformation are \nclear:  increased access to funding and regulatory authority, freeing the institutions from \ndependence on donor funds and capital constraints on growth, and allowing them to \noffer a wider range of financial services.   \nThere is also a recent trend in the opposite direction\u2014traditional banks getting \ninvolved in microfinance in a variety of ways.  In both regions there are examples of \nlarge state banks moving into microfinance, such as Banco Nacional de Costa Rica and \nBank Rakyat Indonesia\u2019s (BRI ) Micro Business Division.3  Recently there is a similar \ntrend in the private banking sector as well.  Until it was closed in April 2004 for \nnoncompliance with prudential regulations, Bank Dagang Bali (BDB) was an early \nexample of commercial banking involvement in microfinance in Indonesia.  Rural banks \nin the Philippines are the dominant providers of microfinance and the USAID-funded \nMicroenterprise  Access  to  Banking  Services  (MABS)  program  aims  to  assist \nparticipating rural banks in expanding the services they provide to the micro-enterprise \nsector.  Pakistan has established a number of private commercial banks that provide \nretail microfinancial services. Malaysia, Nepal and Thailand also have programs in \neffect to encourage commercial bank involvement in microfinance.4  In Latin America, \nBanco Agricola Comercial (El Salvador), Banco del Desarrollo (Chile), Banco Wiese \n(Peru) and Banco Empresarial (Guatemala) are examples of private commercial banks \nthat  are  involved  in  varying  degrees  with  microfinance.    Falling  in  between  state \ninvolvement and private commercial initiatives is a program in India started by the \nNational  Bank  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (NABARD),  under  which  a \nnumber  of  private  banks  have  become  involved  in  microfinance.    ICICI  Bank  in \nparticular  has  experimented  with  some  innovative  approaches  to  microfinance \ninvolvement under the NABARD program.  These trends place microfinance squarely \nwithin the conventional financial sector and raise important issues of governance and \nregulation in connection with the new institutions.  \nIn both regions, therefore, we see similar trends towards a provision of a wider \nrange of financial services, a move away from traditional group lending to individual \nloans, and in summary a greater shift towards commercialization of the sector, with \nLatin America being more advanced in this process. However, in both regions, NGOs \nremain important providers, and in Asia they are still the dominant mode of delivery. \nThe NGO sector is still, with exceptions, not financially sustainable and continues to \nrely on subsidies of various sorts.  In these circumstances, given what seems to be a \nfragmenting MFI sector in many countries with a division between NGO-based lending \nand commercially- driven banking operations, there is a strong need for studies that \nshed light on the poverty consequences of different modalities. If NGOs are to continue \nto draw on subsidized finance, there is a need to demonstrate that they can reach the \n                                                 \n3 Patten et al (2001) find evidence that the microfinance side of the Indonesian banking system performed \nmuch more robustly during the macro crises of the late 1990s than did the commercial banking sector. \n4 In Sri Lanka, the microfinance sector is highly subsidized, discouraging entry by private commercial \nbanks, but Hatton National Banks (HNB), Seylan Bank and Sampath Bank have become involved in the \nsector.  However, Charitonenko, Campion and Fernando (2004) report that their combined microloans \naccounted for just 1.2% of the industry total at the end of 2000 and that none of the microfinance \nprograms are profitable. Thus, the future of the involvement of private commercial banks in microfinance \nin Sri Lanka is questionable.   \n 4", "poor and do so in a cost-effective manner, compared with other forms of poverty \ntargeting interventions. If public policy is to encourage the transformation of NGOs into \nregulated financial institutions or if the delivery of small loans is to be left to the \ncommercial banking sector, the concern that the client base will change so that poor \nclients are excluded by application of tighter commercial criteria must be addressed. In \nsuch instances there is a need to learn more about the poverty consequences of the \nongoing changes in the MFI sector in many countries. \n3.  Poverty and Microfinance \nHere, we define poverty as an income (or more broadly welfare) level below a socially \nacceptable  minimum,  and  microfinance  as  one  of  a  range  of  innovative  financial \narrangements designed to attract the poor as either borrowers or savers. In terms of \nunderstanding poverty, a simple distinction can be drawn within \u2018the poor\u2019 between the \nlong-term or \u2018chronic poor\u2019 and those who temporarily fall into poverty as a result of \nadverse shocks (\u2018transitory poor\u2019). Within the chronic poor, one can further distinguish \nbetween  those  who  are  either  so  physically  or  socially  disadvantaged  that  without \nwelfare support they will always remain in poverty (the \u2018destitute\u2019) and the larger group \nwho are poor because of a lack of assets and opportunities. Furthermore within the non-\ndestitute  category,  one  may  distinguish  by  the  depth  of  poverty  (that  is  how  far \nhouseholds are below the poverty line) with those significantly below it representing the \n\u2018core poor\u2019, sometimes categorized by the irregularity of their income. In some Latin \nAmerican cases, for example, the core poor or destitute are taken to be those below 50% \nof the poverty line (although Latin American poverty lines are generally higher than \nthose in Asia). \nIn principle, microfinance can relate to the chronic (non-destitute) poor and to \nthe transitory poor in different ways. The condition of poverty has been interpreted \nconventionally as one of lack of access by poor households to the assets necessary for a \nhigher standard of income or welfare, whether assets are thought of as human (access to \neducation), natural (access to land), physical (access to infrastructure), social (access to \nnetworks of obligations) or financial (access to credit) (World Bank 2000:34).  Lack of \naccess to credit is readily understandable in terms of the absence of collateral that the \npoor can offer conventional financial institutions, in addition to the various complexities \nand  high  costs  involved  in  dealing  with  large  numbers  of  small,  often  illiterate, \nborrowers. The poor have thus to rely on loans from either moneylenders at high \ninterest rates or friends and family, whose supply of funds is limited. MFIs attempt to \novercome these barriers through innovative measures such as group lending and regular \nsavings schemes, as well as the establishment of close links between poor clients and \nstaff  of  the  institutions  concerned.  The  range  of  possible  relationships  and  the \nmechanisms employed are very wide.  \nThe case for microfinance as a mechanism for poverty reduction is simple. If \naccess to credit can be improved, it is argued, the poor can finance productive activities \nthat will allow income growth, provided there are no other binding constraints. This is a \nroute out of poverty for the non-destitute chronic poor. For the transitory poor, who are \nvulnerable to fluctuations in income that bring them close to or below the poverty line, \nmicrofinance provides the possibility of credit at times of need and in some schemes the \nopportunity  of  regular  savings  by  a  household  itself  that  can  be  drawn  on.  The \n 5", "avoidance of sharp declines in family expenditures by drawing on such credit or savings \nallows \u2018consumption smoothing.\u2019 In practice this distinction between the needs of the \nchronic and transitory poor for credit for \u2018promotional\u2019 (that is income creating) and \n\u2018protectional\u2019 (consumption smoothing) purposes, respectively, is over-simplified since \nthe chronic poor also have short term needs that have to be met, whether they are due to \nincome shortfalls or unexpected expenditures like medical bills or social events like \nweddings or funerals. One of the most interesting generalizations to emerge from the \nmicrofinance and poverty literature is that the poorest of the chronic poor (the core \npoor) borrow essentially for protectional purposes given both the low and irregular \nnature of their income. This group, it is suggested, is too risk averse to borrow for \npromotional measures (that is for investment in the future) and therefore is only a very \nlimited beneficiary of microfinance schemes (Hulme and Mosley 1996: 132). \nThe  view  that  it  is  the  less  badly-off  poor  who  benefit  principally  from \nmicrofinance has become highly influential and, for example, was repeated in the World \nDevelopment Report on poverty  (World Bank 2000:75). Apart from the risk aversion \nargument noted above a number of other explanations for this outcome have been put \nforward. A related issue refers to the interest rates charged to poor borrowers. Most \nmicrofinance schemes charge close to market-clearing interest rates (although these are \noften not enough to ensure full cost-recovery given the high cost per loan of small-scale \nlending).  It may be that, even setting aside the argument of risk aversion, such high \nrates are unaffordable to the core poor given their lack of complementary inputs. In \nother words, despite their having a smaller amount of capital, marginal returns to the \ncore poor may be lower than those to the better-off poor. If the core poor cannot afford \nhigh interest rates, they will either not take up the service or take it up and get into \nfinancial difficulties. Also, where group lending is used, the very poor may be excluded \nby other members of the group, because they are seen as a bad credit risk, jeopardizing \nthe position of the group as a whole. Alternatively, when professional staff operate as \nloan officers, they may exclude the very poor from borrowing, again on the grounds of \nrepayment risk. In combination, these factors, it is felt by many, explain the weakness of \nmicrofinance in reaching the core poor.5 The sector has responded in a number of cases \nby establishing special programs for the core or \u2018ultra poor\u2019. The best known of these \nare in Bangladesh and involve the well-established institutions of BRAC and ASA. The \nprograms  essentially  aim  to  provide  a  range  of  services,  covering  training,  health \nprovision and more general social development for the disadvantaged, as well as grants \nof assets or credits. The ultra poor are encouraged to build up a savings fund and to \ngraduate  to  conventional  microfinance  programs.  Other  variants  of  this  approach \ninvolve greater flexibility in repayment terms for the poorest (Fernando 2004). \nGiven the new trends in the sector and their possible effect in diluting the \noriginal  poverty  focus  of  MFIs,  the  question  of  their  impact  on  the  poor  (and \n                                                 \n5 An important attempt to address this problem has been the Income Generation for Vulnerable Group \nDevelopment (IGVGD) program run by BRAC in Bangladesh, which combines measures of livelihood \nprotection (food aid) with livelihood promotion (skills training and micro credit). Hence micro credit is \nprovided as part of a package approach. Matin and Hulme (2003) survey the evidence on how far the \nbenefits of this program actually reach the core poor and conclude that although the program was more \nsuccessful than more conventional micro credit schemes, nonetheless many target households were still \nmissed.  \n 6", "particularly the core poor) is clearly of great policy interest. It might be thought that if \nsuch institutions are designed to serve only poor clients and if repayment rates are high, \nno further detailed analysis is needed. Such a view is misleading for a number of \nreasons. First, there is no guarantee that only the poor will be served unless strong \neligibility criteria (such as land ownership) are enforced. Often the aim is to dissuade \nthe non-poor through the inconvenience of frequent meetings or the stigma of being a \nmember of a credit group of the poor. Such disincentives need not work and eligibility \ncriteria, where they exist, may not be enforced. Second, high repayment rates may be \ndue to social pressure within a group or family and may not reflect the capacity to repay \n(if for example loans from moneylenders have to be taken out to repay the micro credit). \nThird, even if the poor are genuinely served by MFIs, as long as public funds are \nrequired to finance the MFI, there is the issue of how cost-effective this means of \nreaching the poor is compared with alternatives. This requires a comparison of the cost \nof transferring the funds through a micro credit institution per unit of benefit received \nby the target group, as compared with the benefit-cost ratio for alternative schemes for \nreaching  the  core  poor,  such  as  food  subsidies,  workfare,  and  integrated  regional \ndevelopment  initiatives.  Such  comparisons  must  take  account  of  not  just  the \nadministrative costs involved, but also the leakage rate (that is, the benefits to the non-\npoor).  \nHence for these reasons there is a strong case in favor of attempting to assess \nboth  the  depth  of  outreach  of  microfinance  programs,  the  impact  of  access  to \nmicrofinance services on the welfare of clients and the costs of achieving this impact. \nOn the first point, assessing the depth of outreach or access of the poor to \nmicrofinance programs, it is important to note from the outset that most MFIs probably \ndo  not  consider  their  institutional  mission  to  be  serving  the  poorest  of  the  poor.  \nParticularly in Latin America, most MFIs report a broader agenda to provide financial \nservices to poor communities or specific groups such as female entrepreneurs who \nwould not otherwise have access.  Among MFIs that report to the Mix Market, slightly \nless than half of those in Asia identified \u201cspecifically targeting very poor clients\u201d as \ntheir institutional mission.  In Latin America, the share is even smaller: only around \n10%.  Of the Latin American MFIs that claim to target very poor clients, only two use \nsome sort of targeting tool to identify clients.  In Asia, most of those specifically \ntargeting  the  very  poor  use  some  sort  of  targeting  tool,  such  as  a  means  test, \nparticipatory wealth ranking or a housing index to identify the target group.   \nFor  those  MFIs  that  do  explicitly  aim  to  serve  the  poorest  within  their \ncommunity, recent work on poverty outreach of MFIs has focused on constructing a \npoverty index that can be used to establish whether the target group is being reached. \nThe  Consultative  Group  to  Assist  the  Poorest  (CGAP)  has  developed  a  poverty \nassessment tool (PAT) that can be used to compare clients and non-clients of MFIs in \nthe same community. This is done through the construction of a weighted index of \npoverty based on a range of indicators covering the human resources of households, \ncharacteristics of their dwellings, measures of food security and assets.  The different \nindicators are weighted by principal components analysis, which allows weights to \ndiffer between cases (Zeller et al 2001). The approach here is to sort a non-client sample \ninto three equal groups (high, intermediate and low) on the basis of their poverty score. \nThe poverty index scores at the cut-off points between the three groups then become a \n 7", "reference point for the client or participant sample and their distribution between the \nthree categories can be compared with that of the non-clients. As the non-client groups \nare divided equally, any deviation from equal proportions amongst the clients signals a \nskew either for or against greater poverty outreach.6  \nThe PAT is an assessment of outreach, rather than impact, and therefore does \nnot directly address the question of what impact the programs have on their clients. \nConducting a rigorous impact assessment is challenging.  It is not simply a case of \nlooking at a group of borrowers, observing their income change after they take out \nmicro loans and establishing who has risen above the poverty line. Accurate assessment \nrequires a rigorous test of the counterfactual\u2014that is how income (or whatever measure \nis used) with a micro credit compares with what it would be without it, with the only \ndifference in the two cases being the availability of credit. This requires empirically a \ncontrol group identical in characteristics to the recipients of credit and engaged in the \nsame productive activities, who have not received credit, and whose income (or other \nmeasure) can be traced through time to compare with that of the credit recipients.  \nA practitioner-friendly impact assessment toolkit is also available: the result of \nthe Assessing the Impact of Microenterprise Services (AIMS) Project.  This assessment \ntool has been used in longitudinal studies of the impact of programs in Peru (Mibanco), \nIndia (SEWA) and Zimbabwe (Zambuko Trust).  This procedure looks at change over \ntime and matches pairs of observations between borrowers and members of a control \ngroup, where each pair have similar starting values for the impact variable (like income \nor  sales  revenue)  and  other  characteristics,  like  age,  gender  or  sector  of  activity.  \nSimplifying, this approach identifies impact as: \n \nImpact   =   1/n \u03a3 (Y    -  Y )p \nt+1 t\n \nWhere Y and Y   are an impact variable (like income) in period t and t +1 \nt t+1\nrespectively, and p refers to matched pairs of borrowers and non-borrowers, where there \nare n pairs. Thus impact can be rationalized as the average difference between matched \npairs of program participants and control group.7 Where impact is greater than zero (and \nstatistically  significant)  microfinance  will  have  made  a  difference  and  once  again \ninitially  poor  and  non-poor  borrowers  can  be  distinguished  in  the  analysis.  The \nweakness in the applications of this approach to date is that researchers have only been \nable to control for observable characteristics.  \nFailure to account for unobservable characteristics may lead to biased measures \nof impact.  Two key sources of bias can arise in empirical work that attempts to assess \n                                                 \n6 CGAP reports that the CGAP-PAT has been used to assess the relative poverty level of clients of 7 \nMFIs\u20142 of these are in Asia and 2 in Latin America.  Three of these MFIs who explicitly identify \nserving  the  poorest of  the  poor  as  an  institutional  mission  appear  to be succeeding  in  that goal.  \nInstitutions with broader goals tended to serve a clientele that is more representative of the communities \nin which they operate, which may or may not be poorer than the national average.  \n7 The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) essentially allows separate parallel regression lines to be fitted \nthrough the data for the treatment (borrower) and control groups. The regression lines measure the \noutcome variable for a given year (t + n) relative to an earlier year (t). Insofar as a program like \nmicrocredit has a tangible effect this will be picked up by the distance between the two lines, that is by \nthe difference in intercept terms. The statistical significance of this distance gives a test for the impact of \nthe program. \n 8", "the impact of micro credit on poor households\u2014selection bias and placement bias.  The \nformer arises where there are key differences between borrowers and non-borrowers \nthat cannot be observed, measured and allowed for, with self-selection bias (that is \nwhere those with particular characteristics choose to participate in a program) being a \nkey problem. Hence whilst differences in education, age or gender can be controlled for \nstatistically, there can also be differences in attitude to risk or \u2018entrepreneurship\u2019, which \nwill be basically unobservable. A bias will arise if there is an association between the \ndecision to take a micro loan and these unobserved characteristics. For instance, if the \nmore entrepreneurial individuals are those who take out loans, growth in their income \nrelative to that of those who have not taken out a loan may be due in part to the effect of \nthe loan itself, but in part to their entrepreneurial ability. Attribution of all of the change \nto the loan will overstate its impact.  Placement bias arises where loans go to locations \nor activities that are in some way favored, such as villages with better infrastructure or \nsectors with strong demand growth. Comparing income change for households in a \nsuperior  location  (or  sector)  who  have  a  loan,  with  income  change  for  similar \nhouseholds  in  another  location  (or  sector),  who  have  not  taken  out  a  loan,  and \nattributing of all this to the loan will create an upward bias.  \nBest-practice  approaches  to  resolving  these  problems  employ  a  form  of \n\u201cdifference-in-difference\u201d (two-stage least squares instrumental variables) analysis that \ncompares participants and a similar control group and between locations or sectors with \nand without access to the program.8 One approach (as used for example by Pitt and \nKhandker [1998] on Bangladesh) is to use exogenous eligibility criteria for participation \nin a microfinance program (for example lack of land ownership) as a means of avoiding \na self-selection bias. A placement bias is avoided by comparing those who are eligible \nwith those who are ineligible, both in villages that are covered by programs and those \nthat are not. Hence the analysis based on a double difference can be simplified as \nfollows \nImpact  =  (Yep  -  Yip)  -   (Yen -  Yin)   \n \nWhere Y is change in an outcome measure (such as income) over the study \nperiod, e and i stand for eligible and ineligible households, respectively, and p and n \nstand for program and non-program villages, respectively. For microfinance to produce \npositive results, Impact must be greater than zero. If poor and non-poor borrowers can \nbe identified, there will be a quantification of the poverty impact. \nThe chief problem with this approach is that many microfinance schemes do \nnot use formal eligibility criteria and those that do may not always enforce them, \ncreating a further source of error. An alternative where no formal criteria are set out but \napprovals for borrowing are known is to use as a control group those approved for loans \nwho have not yet taken them up (for example as used by Mosley and Hulme [1996] in \ntheir country studies). This addresses the self-selection issue, unless not taking up a loan \nreveals an aversion to risk and is correlated with subsequent outcomes.  \nA variant of this approach (as applied by Coleman [1999, 2004] for Thailand) \ndraws on the fact that most microfinance activities start in a narrowly defined area and \nthen expand their coverage to similar villages elsewhere or within urban centers. In the \n                                                 \n8 This discussion draws extensively on Coleman (2001). \n 9", "rural case, if the villages are similar and if the borrowers can choose to participate, then \nself-selecting participants in villages that have been identified for later inclusion in a \nprogram should provide an accurate control group for current borrowers in villages with \na program. Here, again simplifying, this is equivalent to estimating impact as  \n \nImpact  =  (Y   -  Y ) - (Y   -  Y )   \nPt+1 Nt+1 Pt Nt\n \nWhere Y is as before, P and N stand for (self-selecting) participants and non-\nparticipants respectively, t stands for time a program has been operative in a particular \nvillage, so t + 1 covers the early and t the late entrant villages. \nHere we examine some of the recent \u2018rigorous\u2019 studies on the impact of MFIs \nbased on survey data that employ versions of these methodologies. We do not report the \nresults  of  work  based  on  more  qualitative  or  participatory  approaches.9 Table  2 \nsummarizes the results of the studies surveyed here for Asia, and Table 3 does the same \nfor Latin America. In general, it is perhaps not surprising that studies based on a \nrigorous  counterfactual  find  much  smaller  gains  from  microfinance  than  simple \nunadjusted before-and-after type comparisons, which erroneously attribute all gains to \nmicro credit. Also, although the results are far from consistent, studies on Asia tend to \nreport a stronger poverty impact from microfinance than do comparable ones from Latin \nAmerica. \n \n \nTable 2.

Poverty Impact Studies: Asia \nOne of the early and most widely cited of the poverty impact studies is Hulme and \nMosley (1996). It employs a control group approach looking at the changes in income \nfor  households  in  villages  with  microfinance  programs  and  changes  for  similar \nhouseholds (for example, in terms of initial income, gender, education, and location) in \nnon-program areas. As far as possible, the control groups are drawn from households \n 14", "eligible for loans who have been approved for loans by the institutions concerned, but \nwho have not yet received a loan. Programs in a number of countries are considered \nincluding the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and the Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI). In \ngeneral, a positive impact is found on borrower incomes of the poor (1988-92) with an \naverage increase over the control groups ranging from 10-12% in Indonesia, to around \n30% in Bangladesh and India  (Hulme and Mosley 1996, table 8.1). Gains are larger for \nnon-poor  borrowers,  however,  and  within  the  group  the  poor  gains  are  negatively \ncorrelated with income. However, despite the breadth of the study and its use of control \ngroup techniques, it has been criticized for possible placement bias, since microfinance \nprograms may be drawn to better placed villages, so that part of the advantage relative \nto the control group may be due to this more favorable location. The quality and \naccuracy of some of the data, particularly in relation to the representative nature of the \ncontrol groups, has been questioned (Morduch 1999:1600). There also appears to be a \nbasic problem with the data side of the case studies, since they are not based on a \ncomparison between baseline data and that for a later survey year. Rather there is at \nleast partial recourse to a recall approach for the earlier years of the period covered, as \nrespondents  are  asked  to  estimate  their  income  retrospectively.  Finally,  the  major \nconclusion of the study that there is a positive correlation of gains from microfinance \nwith  income,  so  that  poorer  borrowers  gain  proportionately  less,  has  also  been \nchallenged  on  the  grounds  that  their  comparison  of  income  changes  for  different \ncategories of borrowers biases their results in favor of the conclusion.  This is because \ngains for different income groups are compared with the average for a control group, \nrather than with the change for comparable income categories within the control group; \nin other words, gains to very poor borrowers are compared with average gains in the \ncontrol group, and not to the gains to the very poor controls (Morduch 2003). \nAnother major early initiative that provides some of the firmest empirical work \nis the surveys conducted in the 1990s by the Bangladesh Institute of Development \nStudies (BIDS) and the World Bank; these provided the data for several major analyses, \nsuch as Pitt and Khandker (1998).  Khandker (1998) summarizes a number of different \nstudies conducted in Bangladesh using the 1991/92 survey, focusing on three major \nmicrofinance  programs,  including  the  Grameen  Bank  and  the  Bangladesh  Rural \nAdvancement Committee (BRAC). As discussed above, impact is assessed using a \ndouble-difference approach between eligible and ineligible households (with holdings \nof land of more than half an acre making households ineligible) and between program \nand  non-program  villages.  After  controlling  for  other  factors,  such  as  household \ncharacteristics, any remaining difference is attributed to the microfinance programs. The \nstudy draws a number of conclusions, but the main one is that the program had a \npositive effect on household consumption, which was significantly greater for female \nborrowers. On average, a loan of 100 taka to a female borrower, after it is repaid, allows \na net consumption increases of 18 taka. In terms of poverty impact, it is estimated that \n5% of participant households are pulled above the poverty line annually.  \nKhandker (2003) follows up this earlier work employing panel data. He uses \nthe BIDS - World Bank survey conducted in 1998-99 that traces the same households \nfrom the 1991-92 survey.  He finds apparently strong and positive results. Whilst \nborrowing by males appears to have no significant impact on consumption, that by \nfemales, who are the dominant client group, does have a positive impact. From this \n 15", "analysis, a 100 taka loan to a female client is found to lead to a 10.5 taka increase in \nconsumption (compared with 18 taka in the earlier analysis). Allowing for the impact of \nhigher consumption on poverty gives estimates of poverty impact. It is estimated that \ndue  to  participation  in  microfinance  programs,  moderate  poverty  among  program \nparticipants decreased by 8.5 percentage points over the period of seven years and \nextreme poverty dropped about 18 points over the same period.10 He also finds evidence \nof positive spillovers on non-program participants in the villages, with the impact being \ngreater for those in extreme poverty. Over the study period of seven years, poverty for \nnon-participants is found to decline by 1 percentage point due to the programs, whilst \nextreme poverty declines by nearly 5 percentage points. This impact is due solely to \nfemale borrowing. \nThe same data set has also been used to identify health impacts as opposed to \nincome changes. Pitt et al (2003) find that credit going to females has a large and \nsignificant impact in two out of three health measures for children. Male borrowing has \nno such effect. For example, a 10% increase in credit to females increases the arm \ncircumference of daughters by 6.3%. A 10% increase in female credit on average \nincreases the height of girls by 0.36 cm annually and of boys by 0.50 cm. The relations \nare stronger for daughters than sons. Hence in Bangladesh, micro credit and improved \nfamily health appear to be related. \nThese are strong and positive results and are probably the clearest evidence that \nmicrofinance is working in the way intended to bring sustained relief from poverty. \nHowever a couple of caveats are in order. First, the accuracy of the original results as \npresented  in  Pitt  and  Khandker  (1998)  has  been  disputed  on  the  grounds  that  the \neligibility  criteria  of  low  land  holdings  was  not  enforced  strictly  in  practice.  In  a \nreworking of the results focusing on what are claimed to be more directly comparable \nhouseholds,  no  impact  on  consumption  from  participation  in  a  program  is  found \n(Morduch 1999:1605).11 Second, in the BIDs-World Bank survey data, the \u2018ultra poor\u2019 \n(defined as those with less than 0.2 acres of land) form nearly 60% of participants and \nthe likelihood of participation is strongly negatively associated with the level of land \nholding.  Nonetheless,  how  much  is  borrowed  depends  principally  on  the \nentrepreneurship of households, so that the charge that the risk-averse very poor will \nbenefit proportionately less has not been totally dispelled. Furthermore, the panel data \nreveal a relatively high dropout rate of around 30%, indicating that there may have been \nproblems of repayment for many households. \nFor Asia, there are examples of studies that are either inconclusive or provide \nless  convincing  results.  Coleman  (1999)  and  MkNelly  et  al  (1996)  both  focus  on \nexperiences with village banking in Thailand. Coleman (1999) utilizes data on villages \nthat participated in village bank microfinance schemes and control villages that were \ndesignated as participants, but had not yet participated. As noted above, this allows a \ndouble  difference  approach  that  compares  the  difference  between  income  for \nparticipants and non-participants in program villages with the same difference in the \ncontrol villages, where the programs were introduced later. From the results here, the \n                                                 \n10 Poverty is based on a daily calorie intake of 2112 and extreme poverty on one of 1739. \n11 This debate, which in part centers around details of econometric estimation, has not been resolved. An \nunpublished paper by Pitt reworks the original analysis to address the concerns of Morduch and is said to \nconfirm the original results (Khandker 2003, footnote 1). \n 16", "poverty  impact  of  the  schemes  appears  highly  dubious.  Months  of  village  bank \nmembership have no impact on any asset or income variables and there is no evidence \nthat village bank loans were directed to productive purposes. The small size of loans \nmeans that they were largely used for consumption, but one of the reasons there is a \nweak poverty impact is that there was a tendency for wealthier households to self-select \ninto village banks. \nColeman  (2004)  uses  the  same  survey  data  but  reconsiders  the  estimation \nstrategy to control for self-selection. He argues that the village bank methodology, \nwhich relies on self-selection by loan size and monitoring by frequent meetings, may \nnot  reach  the  poorest.  As  many  better-off  households  tend  to  be  on  village  bank \ncommittees, the failure to control for this leads to systematic biases. The regression \nresults  of  Coleman  (2004)  indicate  that  there  is  a  substantial  difference  between \nordinary members and committee members of village banks. The impact of micro credit \non ordinary members\u2019 wellbeing is either insignificantly different from zero or negative. \nOn  the  contrary,  the  impact  of  microfinance  programs  on  committee  members\u2019 \nmeasures of wealth, such as income, savings, productive expenses and labor time is \npositive, implying a form of program capture by the better-off in the village, even \nthough this group may not be well-off by national standards. A similar result in terms of \nrationing micro credit in favor of better-off groups or members is found by Doung and \nIzumida (2002) in a study of six villages in Vietnam. There, whilst credit availability is \nlinked with production and income, household economic position and prestige in a \nvillage plus the amount of credit applied for are the main determinants of how credit is \nallocated. \nMkNelly et al (1996) evaluate the Freedom from Hunger credit with education \nprogram in Thailand operated through village banks. The results show positive benefits. \nHowever, although non-participants in non-program villages are used as controls, there \nare problems in accepting the results. No statistical tests are reported, so one cannot \njudge whether differences between participants and non-participants are significant.  \nThere is also a potential measurement bias, since the staff responsible for the program \nalso did the interviewing. \nChen and Snodgrass (2001) examine the operations of the Self Employed \nWomen\u2019s  Association  (SEWA)  bank  in  India,  which  provides  low-income  female \nclients in the informal sector with both saving and loan services. The study tests for the \nimpact of these services by comparing the bank\u2019s clients against a randomly selected \ncontrol group in a similar geographic area. Two surveys were conducted two years \napart.  Average  incomes  rose  over  time  for  all  groups\u2014borrowers,  savers  and  the \ncontrol, although the increase was less for the latter. In terms of poverty incidence, there \nwas little overall change, although there was substantial \u2018churning\u2019, in that amongst the \nclients of SEWA there was significant movement above or below the poverty line. In \ninterpreting these results, Meyer (2002) argues that the evidence on the counterfactual\u2014\nthat is what would have happened to the clients in the absence of the services of \nSEWA\u2014is not sufficiently strong to draw any firm conclusions on poverty impact. \nThe smoothing of consumption over time to protect the poor against adverse \nshocks  is  one  of  the  principle  objectives  of  micro  credit.  Using  data  again  for \n 17", "Bangladesh, Amin et al (2003) compute several measures of vulnerability.12 They find \nthat the micro credit participants in the two villages covered are more likely to be below \nthe  poverty  line  than  if  they  had  been  selected  at  random,  and  conclude  that  the \nprograms have reached the poor. However, the vulnerable are more likely to join a \nmicro credit program in only one of the two villages. Further, for the vulnerable below \nthe poverty line, in one village there is no evidence that they are more likely to be \nmembers of a program and in the other village there is evidence that they have either \nchosen not to join or are actively excluded, presumably on the grounds that they are a \npoor credit risk. Hence the very poor and vulnerable do not appear to be reached.  \nMore positive conclusions in terms of the ability of microfinance to reduce \nvulnerability are found for Indonesia by Gertler et al (2003), who find that access to \nmicrofinance helps households smooth consumption in the face of declines in the health \nof adult family members. Having established an empirical relationship between health \ncondition and consumption, the authors test for a relation between access to a financial \ninstitution  and  consumption  shortfalls  associated  with  ill  health.  Using  geographic \ndistance as a measure of access, they find that for households in an area with a BRI \nbranch, health shocks have no effect on consumption.  This study does not differentiate \nwithin the group of the poor. \n3.2. Poverty Impact Studies: Latin America \nIn Latin America in general, the impact of microfinance on poverty has been less well \ndocumented both in a methodological sense and in terms of coverage in individual \nstudies, which tend to be concentrated in a small number of countries, principally \nBolivia  and  Peru.  The  overall  impression,  however,  is  that  compared  with  Asia, \nmicrofinance  has  reached  less  far  down  the  income  scale  and  that  a  significant \nproportion of borrowers are not in fact below the poverty line, although they may well \nhave below average incomes. This is likely to be due at least in part to a greater \ncommercial orientation with a focus on credit for urban micro-enterprises, with lower \nrural outreach in Latin America as compared with other regions. A typical requirement \nfor access to credit from an MFI has been that the borrower should be the owner of a \nmicro-enterprise, holding a national identification card and having at least six to twelve \nmonths experience in the economic activity for which the loan is to be used (Gulli and \nBerger 1999:26). It is perhaps not surprising that many of the poor do not meet these \ncriteria.  \nFor example, detailed evidence on the outreach of MFIs in Bolivia is provided \nby the survey reported in Navajas et al (2000), who use an index of basic needs \nfulfillment to classify borrowers into poor and non-poor groups. For the urban area of \nLa Paz, they find that two of three MFIs tend to lend disproportionately to those above \nof the poverty line. For two of the three, the share of \u2018moderately poor\u2019 borrowers (at \n29%) is lower than their share of the population (at 38%), although this is not the case \nfor the third MFI, BancoSol (at 47%). However of the very poorest group, the share of \nborrowers in all three institutions (at 2-5%) is well below their share in the population, \nreinforcing the view that MFIs have difficulty in reaching the very poor. When rural \n                                                 \n12 Unlike the Khandker studies, these data choose households before they join a micro credit scheme. \nTheir vulnerability measure is broader than simply fluctuations in consumption. \n 18", "lending activities are also included there is a tendency for a skew in lending towards the \n\u2018threshold\u2019 group, defined as those just above the poverty line and the \u2018moderately\u2019 \npoor. Table 4 gives the ratio of the share of groups of borrowers by poverty class in the \nportfolio of the different MFIs to their share in total population. A figure above unity \nindicates a positive skew towards a particular poverty class, and a figure below unity \nindicates the opposite. \nIn terms of institutional mix FIE, PRODEM and Sartawi are NGOs, whilst \nBancoSol and Caja Los Andes are regulated financial institutions. Table 4 shows that \nbeing an NGO (like FIE) is no guarantee of a strong allocation of loans to the poor and \nthat both regulated institutions have a superior distribution to FIE. However in turn the \nrural-based NGOs, PRODEM and Sartawi outperform BancoSol by these criteria.  \n \n \nTable 4.

Among the limited number of detailed \npoverty impact studies on Latin America, BancoSol of Bolivia remains by far the most \nstudied institution. Hulme and Mosley (1996, Table 4.1) look at a small sample of \nBancoSol borrowers. Using approved borrowers who had not yet taken out a loan as a \ncontrol, they find an average annual increase in income of 28% for borrowers compared \nwith an average of 14.5% for the control group. An estimated 8% of borrowers crossed \nthe poverty line in 1992 alone. However in comparison with the MFIs from other \ncountries in their study, BancoSol had only a relatively small proportion of borrowers in \nthe sample below the poverty line (29%) and average borrower household income from \nthe sample was nearly five times the national poverty line, a figure far higher than for \nany institution studied in other countries. BancoSol also showed the largest average \nabsolute income increase for borrowers, and the proportionate increases were greater for \nthe poor. Although the Hulme and Mosley study has a reasonable control group criteria \n(approved borrowers who had not yet taken out a loan, but who might be expected to \nshare the self-selection characteristics of current borrowers) it suffers from several \nproblems: there is only a small sample of 36 borrowers; it is not clear whether the \n 19", "control group matches borrowers exactly in terms of characteristics such as education, \ngender or sector of activity; and the sample is surveyed at a point in time so that \nretrospective income estimates are required to derive rates of change. \nThe  last  of  these  problems  is  addressed  for  BancoSol,  but  not  the  other \nBolivian MFIs covered, in Mosley (2001), which resurveys the households covered \nearlier  to  obtain  income  data  at  two  points  in  time.  Mosley  (2001)  finds  that  for \nBancoSol borrowers re-surveyed, on average income growth was a little more than \ntwice (214%) that of the control group; for the other three institutions the excess income \ngrowth for borrowers over the control group was between 132% and 158%. For poor \nborrowers (who were a minority of those surveyed) gains relative to the average for the \ncontrol group were lower than for all borrowers, for example 151% in the case of \nBancoSol. Regression analysis relating income increase per household relative to the \ncontrol  group  average  to  initial  income  shows  a  positive  relationship,  so  that \nproportionate gains from borrowing rise with household income, although at a declining \nrate. There is a positive poverty impact, although given the fact that only a minority of \nborrowers (around one third) were poor at the starting point of the analysis in 1993, this \nis modest. Between 10%\u201320% of poor borrowers, varying between institutions, crossed \nthe poverty line over the period studied as a result of microfinance.13 However when the \ncore poor (those in \u2018extreme poverty\u2019 defined in Bolivia as those living on half the \npoverty line) are considered, it is clear that none of the MFIs studied are reaching them. \nFrom a sample of 200 borrowers over six years for four institutions, there is only one \ncase of the removal of extreme poverty. Hence, this segment of the poor was not \nreached. \nDunn and Arbuckle (2001a, 2001b) use an analysis of covariance to examine \nloans to micro-enterprises for 305 households in Lima, Peru by Mibanco. The study \ndraws on data at two points in time (1997 and 1999) and looks at changes in the \nborrowers relative to a control group of households who had not received a micro-\nenterprise loan. On average, the borrower group appears to be around or slightly above \nthe national poverty line, with approximately 30% below the national poverty line. As \nnoted above, the procedure uses matched observations in the borrower and control \ngroups that have the same starting values for performance variables, like net revenue, \nassets or employment, as well as the same values for \u2018moderating\u2019 variables, like gender \nof entrepreneur, sector of activity and location. Change in the performance variables for \nthe  matched  observations  over  1997\u20131999  are  compared  to  establish  if  there  are \nsignificant differences between the borrowers and the control group. The results suggest \non  average  a  significant  difference  in  terms  of  enterprise  revenue  (roughly  $1000 \nannually),  fixed  assets  and  employment  creation  (as  much  as  nine  extra  days  per \nmonth). These results are very substantial. The study however recognizes that it may be \ndifficult to attribute all of these changes to the micro credit program of Mibanco, as the \nmatching  system  used  does  not  adequately  address  self-selection  bias  and  the \nmoderating variables used seem crude (for example, the sector variables reported are \n                                                 \n13 There is some ambiguity in the interpretation of poverty impact since the definition of the headcount \npoverty index in the notes to Table 5 in Mosley (2001) does not seem to match the explanation in the text. \nThis refers to between 10 and 20 per cent \u2018of borrowers\u2019 crossing the poverty line as a consequence of \nmicrofinance. We take this to mean \u2018of poor borrowers\u2019 given the low poverty outreach reported in Table \n5. \n 20", "\u2018commercial, service and industrial\u2019 rather than anything more precise such as industrial \nsubsectors).   \nThe poverty dimension of the study as reported in Dunn and Arbuckle (2001b) \nshows  a  positive  poverty  reduction  effect.  For  households  starting  with  the  same \npoverty level, number of income sources and economically active members in 1997, on \nbalance after net effects are allowed for by 1999, borrowers were 6% more likely to be \nabove the poverty line than non-borrowers. There is the contrary result, however, that in \nthe smaller group of new borrowers who took out a loan during 1997\u20131999, but not \ninitially in 1997, new borrowers were 15% less likely to have moved out of poverty than \nthe control group.14 The poor and non-poor appear to benefit almost equally in absolute \nterms, although there is evidence that the poorer borrowers were 20% more likely to \nliquidate assets in response to a financial shock. \nBanegas et al (2002) look at the operations of two MFIs in Ecuador (Banco \nSolidario) and Bolivia (Caja los Andes) utilizing the CGAP poverty index noted above \nto establish outreach and a logit regression model (where being a client and taking a \nloan gives a dependent variable of 1.0 and being a non-client a dependent variable of \nzero) that links participation in a program with income changes and poverty scores. It is \nfound that for both institutions, taking a loan is associated with increases in income. \nHowever income change is measured not by the size of monetary values but by a simple \nscoring system (1 for income decrease, 2 for unchanged income and 3 for income \nincrease). The relation with poverty varies since in the case of Banco Solidario lower \npoverty is associated with a greater probability of taking a loan, and in the case of Caja \nlos Andes with a higher probability. On the other hand Banco Solidario has a greater \ndepth of outreach, as 75% of its clients belonged to the lower and intermediate groups \nas defined by the CGAP poverty score, as compared with 48% for Caja los Andes. \nAgain it seems therefore it is the better-off amongst the poor who are benefiting. \nLimitations of this analysis are the crudity of some of the indicators, for example for \nincome change, and the way in which a control group of non-clients are selected; i.e. \nfrom households in the same locality that have micro-enterprises in the same sector as \nthe borrowers and which have not had a loan from a formal sector institution. This \nsimply ignores the issue of self-selection bias and does not control for factors like \neducation and skills. \nFrom a nutritional perspective, MkNelly and Dunford (1999) look at the impact \nof  Credit  with  Education  loans  to  women  in  rural  Bolivia.  A  relatively  rigorous \napproach is applied by collecting data two years apart from a participant group and a \ncontrol group, who would be offered the credit at the end of the study period. In \naddition, amongst the participants, a sub-group of those who joined during the course of \nthe study, rather than immediately, is examined separately. Small loans were available \nin  combination  for  training  in  health  and  nutrition,  as  well  as  micro-enterprise \nmanagement topics. Roughly two-thirds of participants reported an increase in income \nover the study period, and their net incomes in 1997 appeared far higher than the control \ngroup (perhaps casting some doubt on the representativeness of the latter). However, on \n                                                 \n14 To explain this worrying result, the authors suggest that as the poverty measure is expenditure based, \nnew borrowers may curtail their consumption in the short-term to invest in their micro-enterprise at the \nsame time as they take out a new loan, and that this lower consumption may show up as higher poverty in \nthe short-term.  \n 21", "the key concern of the study, nutritional status (for example child height-for-age or \nweight-for-height measures), there is little evidence of any impact due to the program. \nThe most positive result is that for households suffering \u2018food stress\u2019, participants are \nless likely to sell off animals and are more likely to take out loans as a coping strategy, \nthan are non-participants. \nIn general, for Latin America the available studies suggest that MFIs, whilst \nthey may be flourishing in commercial terms, and providing a valuable service to micro-\nenterprises often run by poor entrepreneurs, have relatively weak impact on those at the \nvery bottom of the income distribution. \n4.  Forms of Micro Credit Interventions and Cost-Effectiveness \nIt is clear that experimentation and local variation are likely to be important aspects of \nsuccessful MFIs. A few studies (more in Asia than in Latin America) have looked in \ndetail at the impact and cost effectiveness of different forms of intervention. The Hulme \nand Mosley (1996) cross-country study of 13 institutions in seven countries (Bolivia in \nLatin America and Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka and Indonesia in Asia) found that loan \nimpact, in terms of change in borrower income, (which is not necessary the same as \npoverty impact) was greater in the more financially viable institutions (such as BRI and \nBancoSol). They explain this in terms of the screening efficiency of higher interest rates \nand tighter repayment conditions, which deter less financially sound borrowers. The \ninstitutions involved used a range of delivery mechanisms, and the analysis does not \nallow firm judgments between these. Within-country comparisons by ownership are \nmade explicitly in Park and Ren (2001), who look at the Chinese experience drawing on \nhousehold survey data for 1997. They are able to compare three types of program based \non  ownership  characteristics\u2014NGO-based,  mixed  programs  and  government \nownership. Whether in terms of conventional financial criteria like repayment rates, or \nmeasures of initial impact like targeting effectiveness, the NGO programs appear to \nfunction best, with the government-run programs being the least successful. \nDetailed mechanisms for micro lending are examined for Thailand by Kaboski \nand Townsend (2003), who look at different institutional variants such as production \ncredit groups, women\u2019s groups, rice banks and buffalo banks, as well as a variety of \nservices including training and various savings facilities. Of the forms of institution, \nallowing  for  a  range  of  other  factors,  women\u2019s  groups  appear  to  have  the  largest \npositive impact on their members. Of the services offered, training in conjunction with \ncredit appears to work well and the availability of savings facilities appears to be \nassociated  with  asset  growth  amongst  households.  Of  the  savings  services,  regular \n\u2018pledged savings\u2019 have the largest positive impact. Explanations offered for this include \nthe use of savings as collateral for further loans either from the institution itself or from \nother  sources,  and  a  reduction  in  the  cost  and  risk  of  infrequent  deposits  and \nwithdrawals. However since the poorest may not be in a position to offer regular \nsavings, this also provides an explanation for why they may benefit relatively little from \nMFIs.15  \n                                                 \n15 Fujita (2000) makes this point in the context of Bangladesh. \n 22", "Most studies of the impact of different forms of microfinance do not conduct a \nfull cost effectiveness analysis in order to judge both the effectiveness of different \nalternatives and how microfinance interventions compare in efficiency terms with other \nways of reaching the poor. However there is often a general expectation that MFIs are \nan effective and efficient means of reaching the poor. For example, Wright (2000) \nargues that \u201c...microfinance has a particular advantage over almost (and probably) all \nother interventions\u201d in providing cost-effective and sustainable services to the poor. In \nfact, the evidence to support such a strong claim is not yet available. Bangladesh and \nBolivia,  the  most  widely  studied  countries  for  microfinance,  provide  most  of  the \nevidence on its cost effectiveness. \nThe early work by Khandker (1998) attempts to assess the cost-effectiveness of \nmicro credit in Bangladesh (that is costs per taka of consumption for the poor) as \ncompared  with  more  formal  financial  institutions  and  other  poverty-targeted \ninterventions. His data are summarized in table 5. They appear to be based on the \nassumption of  a zero leakage rate to the non-poor. The interesting result that emerges is \nthat the Grameen Bank is considerably more cost-effective than BRAC and that as \nexpected, loans to female borrowers are considerably more cost-effective than loans to \nmales. Further, subsidies to Grameen (but not to BRAC) appear to be a more cost \neffective means of reaching the poor than various food-for-work programs. However a \nfood-for-education scheme appears very cost-effective relative to the food-for-work \nprograms and to BRAC.16  Formal financial institutions are less cost-effective than \nGrameen for both female and male borrowers, and less cost effective than BRAC in \nsome, both not all, cases examined (Khandker 1998:134-139). The high figure for \nBRAC is in part due to the range of services, such as training, offered in addition to \nmicro credit, but nonetheless if such services are essential to the success of micro credit, \nit is legitimate to include their cost in a cost-benefit assessment of micro credit.  \n \n \n                                                 \n16 The study on this scheme by Wodon (1998) appears considerably more sophisticated than the other \nstudies and compares costs with the future stream of estimated benefits to the poor in terms of gains from \neducation. The ratio for this activity may not be directly comparable with the other figures in the table. \n 23", "Table 5.

The figures for Grameen \nsupport this view, whilst those for BRAC do not. More recently a couple of other \nestimates are available. Burgess and Pande (2003) examine whether the pattern of \ncommercial bank expansion in India into rural areas, previously not served by banks \n(so-called \u2018social banking\u2019), has had an impact on rural poverty, and their work allows a \nsimple comparison with microfinance. Their estimates suggest that it costs 2.72 rupees \nto generate an additional rupee of income for the poor via social banking program. \nCompared with the data in Table 5, this ratio is higher than the cost-effectiveness ratio \nfor Grameen, but lower than that for BRAC.17  \nA further look at the effectiveness of Grameen is provided by Schreiner (2003), \nwho calculates the subsidy-lending ratio at 0.22 over the period 1983-97. This is not \ndirectly equivalent to the ratios in Table 5, but assuming the same return to borrowing \nas in Khandker (1998) these figures can be converted into a broadly equivalent ratio of \ncost to gains to the poor of 1.15. This is consistent with the figures in Table 5, which \nwould need to be averaged to give an overall return to male and female borrowing \n                                                 \n17 It should be noted that the benefits from Grameen lending found in Khandker (2003), which are almost \nhalf of those found in his earlier study, imply considerably higher cost effectiveness ratios than those \nreported in Table 5, unless there has been a corresponding rise in the efficiency of operations. \n 24", "combined. The result confirms Grameen as a relatively cost-effective form of poverty \nintervention, although it says nothing about how the benefits from its activities are \ndistributed between the poor, the very poor and those above the poverty line. \nFor Latin America, Mosley (2001) provides a rare, if approximate, estimate of \ncost-effectiveness  of  MFIs  relative  to  other  poverty  interventions  in  Bolivia.  He \ncompares the estimated numbers in a particular area brought over the poverty line by \nfour different MFIs, as a result of micro credit, to the organizations\u2019 expenditure that \ncan be allocated to activities in that area. This gives a cost per person brought out of \npoverty for four MFIs that use different approaches. BancoSol and Fundacion para la \nPromocion y Desarollo de la Microempresa (PRODEM) are more commercial with \ngreater use of individual loans, whilst ProMujer lends largely to women in urban co-\noperative groups, and Sartawi offers both group and individual loans, but also provides \na range of training and education services in addition to credit. The cost-effectiveness in \nthe MFIs, defined as the cost per person brought out of poverty, is $603 for BancoSol, \n$467 for ProMujer, $373 for PRODEM and $589 for Sartawi. These figures are not \ndirectly comparable with those for Bangladesh reported in Table 5, as the latter are the \nratio of MFI costs to benefit in income (or consumption) received by the poor. Although \nthe range is relatively wide, perhaps due to the approximate nature of the calculations, \nthe author himself suggests that they show that there is little difference between the \ninstitutions and that no single model dominates micro credit delivery in Bolivia (or \nindeed elsewhere). Some approximate comparisons have also been made with the cost \nof poverty reduction from Social Fund investment in health, education and rural roads, \nwhich show microfinance from all of the institutions to be lower in cost than the Social \nFund programs.18 However, the cost effectiveness figures found for MFIs in Bolivia in \ndollars per person brought out of poverty are much higher than some of the anecdotal \nfigures used for Bangladesh. The fact that these estimates, approximate as they are, \nprovide one of the few indications of the cost-effectiveness of MFIs in Latin America, is \nan indication of the undeveloped nature of research on this issue in the region. \nIn general, in terms of cost-effectiveness, there is limited support for the view \nthat MFIs can be a cost-effective way of reaching the poor, although the range of figures \nwithin both Bangladesh and Bolivia suggest that this is far from inevitable for all types \nof MFI. BRAC in particular appears relatively high cost. However, even if it could be \nshown  that  microfinance  uniformly  outperformed  other  targeting  measures  in  cost \neffectiveness  terms,  one  could  still  not  conclude  that  other  measures  should  be \nabandoned and their funds diverted to microfinance. As Khandker (1998) points out, \nparticipants in microfinance borrowing self-select (that is they judge that micro credit \nsuits their particular needs, often for self employed work), whilst microfinance may not \nbe suitable for others amongst the poor.  For this latter group, perhaps more risk adverse \nor more disadvantaged, other forms of targeting will still be required.  \n                                                 \n18 As defined in Table 5 of Mosley (2001), the indicators for the MFIs and the Social Fund programs are \nnot directly comparable as the former are cost per person brought out of poverty and the latter are cost per \nincome benefit received by the poor.  Additional assumptions would have be used to convert the ratios for \nthe Social Fund programs to cost per person brought out of poverty, but these are not referred to. \n 25", "5.  Conclusions \nDespite the current enthusiasm in the donor community for microfinance programs, \nrigorous research on the outreach, impact and cost-effectiveness of such programs is \nrare.  Design of aid programs would ideally incorporate evidence on all three points, but \nthe research that does exist generally focuses on only one of these criteria: either \noutreach, impact or cost-effectiveness.  In part, this reflects the difficulty of establishing \nan appropriate statistical methodology and implementing those standards in practice, \nand in part no doubt reflects the variations found in practice in the way in which \nmicrofinance operates.  The evidence surveyed here suggests that the conclusion from \nthe early literature, that microfinance may have had positive impacts on poverty but is \nunlikely to be a simple panacea for reaching the core poor, remains broadly valid.  \nReaching the core poor is difficult, and some of the reasons that made them difficult to \nreach with conventional financial instruments mean that they may also be high risk and \ntherefore unattractive microfinance clients. \nAsia has much to learn from Latin America in terms of developing a vibrant \ncommercially oriented MFI sector. However MFIs in Latin America have often been \nseen as a vehicle for the development of the micro-enterprise sector rather than as a tool \nfor the removal of core poverty, which was its initial focus in much of Asia. Work on \nBolivia has demonstrated this at least for that country. There has been an extensive \ndebate that we do not touch on here, on the financial sustainability of MFIs. We would \nsimply make the point that just because an institution requires a subsidy to cover its \ncosts in itself is not a reason for not supporting the institution. The issue should be what \nbenefits, in terms of income gains for the poor, can be achieved with the subsidy and \nhow the ratio of subsidy to benefits compares with that for other interventions. Detailed \ncost effectiveness studies are rare and those that are available show both high and low \nscores for MFIs in the same country. Hence there is a need to continually improve \ndesign and outreach and to see MFIs as part of the package for targeting the poor, rather \nthan the whole solution.  \nOur  view  is  that  despite  the  difficulties,  there  is  a  need  for  more  careful \nresearch on the outreach, impact and cost-effectiveness of microfinance programs\u2014\nstudies that rigorously address the critical issues of selection and placement bias.  Such \nstudies can inform the debate on microfinance by sharpening the donor community\u2019s \nunderstanding of the role of microfinance in reaching the poor, its impact in different \nenvironments, and its cost-effectiveness as a poverty intervention.   \n 26", "Bibliography \n \nAmin  S.,  Rai  A.S.  and  Ropa  G.
