Much has been written on the range of institutional \narrangements  pursued  in  different  organizations  and  countries,  and  in  turn  a  vast \nnumber  of  studies  have  attempted  to  assess  the  outreach  and  poverty  impact  of  such \nschemes. However, in the academic development community there is a recognition that \nperhaps we know much less about the impact of these programs than might be expected \ngiven  the  enthusiasm  for  these  activities  among  donor  and  policy-making  circles.  To \nquote a recent authoritative volume on microfinance: \n\nMFI field operations have far surpassed the research capacity to analyze them, \nso excitement about the use of microfinance for poverty alleviation is not backed \nup with sound facts derived from rigorous research. Given the current state of \nknowledge, it is difficult to allocate confidently public resources to microfinance \ndevelopment. (Zeller and Meyer 2002). \n\nThis  is  a  very  strong  statement  of  doubt.  It  in  part  reflects  a  lack  of  accurate \ndata, but also in part methodological difficulties associated with assessing exactly what \nproportion of income and other effects on the beneficiaries of micro credit can actually \nbe attributed to the programs themselves. Here we compare poverty impact studies from \nAsia and Latin America.  In particular we examine evidence on three specific issues:  \n\n\u2212  The success of microfinance programs in reaching the core poor; \n\u2212  The  effectiveness  of  microfinance  initiatives  in  pulling  households  out  of \n\npoverty; \n\n\u2212  The cost effectiveness of microfinance as a poverty targeting tool. \n\n \nThese are very basic questions, and the fact that they can still be posed reflects \nthe  extent  of  uncertainty  in  the  literature.    Since  a  number  of  other  surveys  are  also \navailable, we give most  attention  to  evidence produced in  the last three or  four  years1 \nand  highlight  similarities  and  differences  in  microfinance  as  it  has  developed  in  Asia \nand Latin America. \n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a brief overview of \nsome of the distinguishing characteristics of the microfinance industry in Asia and Latin \n\n                                                 \n1 An earlier helpful survey published by ADBI is Meyer (2002). It draws out some of the methodological \nproblems in assessing impact and surveys a number of important studies available at the time of writing \n(around 2001). Morduch (1999) is an extremely authoritative earlier survey focusing on both conceptual \nand empirical questions. \n\n  1\n\n\fAmerica.    Section  3  discusses  the  potential  for  microfinance  to  combat  poverty  and \nmethodological issues relating to assessing its success in doing so, and Section 4 goes \non  to  survey  the  evidence  from  selected  research  studies  on  this  point.    Section  5 \naddresses the question of cost effectiveness.  Finally we draw some brief conclusions. \n\n2.  Characteristics of Microfinance in Asia and Latin America \n\nMicrofinance  developed  in  Asia  and  Latin  America  under  very  different  ideological, \npolitical  and  economic  conditions.    Hence,  there  are  distinctive  differences  in  the \nindustry  in  the  two  regions.    A  brief  look  at  the  history  of  two  of  the  most  famous \nMFIs\u2014the  Grameen  Bank  in  Bangladesh  and  Banco  Sol  in  Bolivia\u2014gives  an \ninformative picture of how the industry in the two regions can be characterized. \n\nModern microfinance was born in Bangladesh in the 1970s, in the aftermath of \nthe country\u2019s war of independence, when Muhammad Yunus, an economics professor at \nthe University of Chittagong, began an experimental research project providing credit to \nthe  rural  poor.    That  experiment,  driven  by  a  strong  sense  of  developmental  idealism, \ndeveloped  into  what  is  now  the  world\u2019s  most  famous  microfinance  institution,  the \nGrameen Bank, and institutions that replicate its pioneering methodology worldwide. \n\nMicrofinance in Latin America developed under quite different conditions.  In \nBolivia,  a  collapsing  populist  regime  led  to  widespread  unemployment.    Banco  Sol,  a \npioneering microfinance institution in the region, developed to address the problem of \nurban  unemployment  and  provide  credit  to  the  cash-strapped  informal  sector.  The \nnotion of commercial profitability was embraced relatively early in this approach. \n\nAs a result of the different conditions under which the very first microfinance \ninstitutions (MFIs) were founded, the industry in the two regions developed distinctive \ncharacteristics.    In  the  beginning,  \u201c  by  comparison  with  Bangladesh,  the  Bolivian \nintervention was typically urban rather than rural, less concerned with poverty and more \nfocused  on  micro-enterprise.  It  targeted  the  \u2018economically  active  poor\u2019\u2014people  with \nestablished  businesses  that  needed  capital  to  grow.  \u2026  from  the  start,  Bolivian \nmicrocredit  was  itself  seen  as  a  business,  potentially  as  a  branch  of  commercial \nbanking\u201d    (Rutherford  [2003]  p.5).    Many  of  these  differences  still  characterize  the \nindustry in the two regions today. \n\nFor example, data from various sources suggest that Asian MFIs lead the world \nin  terms  of  both  breadth  (number  of  clients)  and  depth  (relative  poverty  of  clients)  of \noutreach.  In their analysis of over 1,500 MFIs from 85 developing countries, Lapeneu \nand Zeller (2001) find that Asia accounted for the majority of MFIs, retained the highest \nvolume of savings and credit, and served more members than any other continent.  The \nmost  recent  data  from  the  Microbanking  Bulletin 2,  reinforces  these  findings.    The \naverage  size  of  loans  and  deposits  are  often  taken  as  a  simple  proxy  of  depth  of \noutreach.    By  these  criteria,  Asian  MFIs  have  among  the  lowest  Loan  and  Savings \nBalance per Borrower, even after adjusting for GNP per capita, suggesting that they are \neffectively reaching the poor.   \n\n                                                 \n2 Microbanking Bulletin reports only data on a limited number of MFIs who choose to participate.  Those \nreporting to the Bulletin are thought to be amongst the best and are therefore unlikely to be representative \nof the industry as a whole (Meyer 2002: 14).    \n\n  2\n\n\fTable 1.

On average, Latin American MFIs registered with the Microbanking \nBulletin show a higher return than those in Asia. Latin America MFIs are also further \nadvanced in the process of drawing in external funding through savings deposits, with \nregistered  institutions  on  average  in  the  region  having  a  deposit-loan  ratio  of  29%, \nroughly double the comparable figure for Asia (Ramirez 2004).  \n\nRegional  data  of  course  cover  up  some  wide  disparities  within  each  region.  \nMicrofinance  is  a  highly  concentrated  industry  and  the  giants  of  the  industry\u2014BRI, \nBRAC  and  ASA\u2014account  for  more  than  50%  of  the  total  number  of  borrowers  from \nthe more than 300 MFIs worldwide who report to the MIX Market. BRI alone accounts \nfor nearly 40% of their gross loans. Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, all in \nAsia, have  the largest number  of members  served and the largest distribution of  loans \nand  mobilization  of  savings  in  terms  of  GNP  in  the  world.    In  contrast,  the  two  most \npopulated  countries  in  Asia\u2014India  and  the  PRC\u2014have  very  low  outreach,  despite  a \nhigh concentration  of  the region\u2019s  poor.  In Latin America, there is very  strong  skew, \nwith MFIs playing a major role as financial providers to micro-enterprise in Bolivia and \nCentral  America,  but  being  largely  insignificant  in  the  larger  countries  of  Brazil, \nMexico and Argentina.  There is wide disparity in terms of financial viability as well.  \nWithin Latin America there is a wide range, with the larger MFIs showing a return on \nassets  in  2001-02  well  above  the  average  for  the  commercial  banking  sector  in  their \ncountries, and with the smaller MFIs in the region, on average, operating at a substantial \nfinancial loss when capital costs are calculated at commercial rates. \n\nThe strong financial performance of the larger MFIs in Latin America is linked \nwith a trend toward commercialization of microfinance in the region.  In 1992, Banco \nSol  became  the  first  example  of  an  NGO  becoming  a  commercial  bank,  and  thus \nbecame  the  first  regulated  microfinance  bank.    Banco  Sol  surpassed  other  Bolivian \nbanks in profitability and became the first MFI to access international capital markets.  \nFollowing  this  successful  example,  at  least  39  other  important  NGOs  worldwide \ntransformed  themselves  into  commercial  banks  over  the  period  1992\u20132003  (Fernando \n[2003]).    Given  that  the  failure  of  commercial  financial  institutions  to  reach  the  poor \nprovided  the  initial  impetus  for  MFIs,  this  new  trend  is  paradoxical  and  raises  the \nquestion  of  whether  the  initial  poverty  reduction  objectives  of  the  transformed  NGOs \nwill  be  subjugated  to  commercial  criteria  (so-called  \u2018mission  drift\u2019).  This  potential \n\n  3\n\n\fdisadvantage  is  still  unexplored  empirically,  but  the  advantages  of  transformation  are \nclear:  increased access to funding and regulatory authority, freeing the institutions from \ndependence  on  donor  funds  and  capital  constraints  on  growth,  and  allowing  them  to \noffer a wider range of financial services.   \n\nThere is also a recent trend in the opposite direction\u2014traditional banks getting \ninvolved  in  microfinance  in  a  variety  of  ways.    In  both  regions  there  are  examples  of \nlarge state banks moving into microfinance, such as Banco Nacional de Costa Rica and \nBank Rakyat Indonesia\u2019s (BRI ) Micro Business Division.3  Recently there is a similar \ntrend  in  the  private  banking  sector  as  well.    Until  it  was  closed  in  April  2004  for \nnoncompliance  with  prudential  regulations,  Bank  Dagang  Bali  (BDB)  was  an  early \nexample of commercial banking involvement in microfinance in Indonesia.  Rural banks \nin  the  Philippines  are  the  dominant  providers  of  microfinance  and  the  USAID-funded \nMicroenterprise  Access  to  Banking  Services  (MABS)  program  aims  to  assist \nparticipating rural banks in expanding the services they provide to the micro-enterprise \nsector.    Pakistan  has  established  a  number  of  private  commercial  banks  that  provide \nretail  microfinancial  services.  Malaysia,  Nepal  and  Thailand  also  have  programs  in \neffect to encourage commercial bank involvement in microfinance.4  In Latin America, \nBanco  Agricola  Comercial  (El  Salvador),  Banco  del  Desarrollo  (Chile),  Banco  Wiese \n(Peru) and Banco Empresarial (Guatemala) are examples of private commercial banks \nthat  are  involved  in  varying  degrees  with  microfinance.    Falling  in  between  state \ninvolvement  and  private  commercial  initiatives  is  a  program  in  India  started  by  the \nNational  Bank  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (NABARD),  under  which  a \nnumber  of  private  banks  have  become  involved  in  microfinance.    ICICI  Bank  in \nparticular  has  experimented  with  some  innovative  approaches  to  microfinance \ninvolvement under the NABARD  program.  These trends place microfinance squarely \nwithin  the  conventional  financial  sector  and  raise  important  issues  of  governance  and \nregulation in connection with the new institutions.  \n\nIn both regions, therefore, we see similar trends towards a provision of a wider \nrange  of  financial  services,  a  move  away  from  traditional  group  lending  to  individual \nloans,  and  in  summary  a  greater  shift  towards  commercialization  of  the  sector,  with \nLatin America being more advanced in this process. However, in both regions, NGOs \nremain  important  providers,  and  in  Asia  they  are  still  the  dominant  mode  of  delivery. \nThe  NGO  sector  is  still,  with  exceptions,  not  financially  sustainable  and  continues  to \nrely  on  subsidies  of  various  sorts.    In  these  circumstances,  given  what  seems  to  be  a \nfragmenting MFI sector in many countries with a division between NGO-based lending \nand  commercially-  driven  banking  operations,  there  is  a  strong  need  for  studies  that \nshed light on the poverty consequences of different modalities. If NGOs are to continue \nto  draw  on  subsidized  finance,  there  is  a  need  to  demonstrate  that  they  can  reach  the \n\n                                                 \n3 Patten et al (2001) find evidence that the microfinance side of the Indonesian banking system performed \nmuch more robustly during the macro crises of the late 1990s than did the commercial banking sector. \n4 In  Sri  Lanka,  the  microfinance  sector  is  highly  subsidized,  discouraging  entry  by  private  commercial \nbanks, but Hatton National Banks (HNB), Seylan Bank and Sampath Bank have become involved in the \nsector.    However,  Charitonenko,  Campion  and  Fernando  (2004)  report  that  their  combined  microloans \naccounted  for  just  1.2%  of  the  industry  total  at  the  end  of  2000  and  that  none  of  the  microfinance \nprograms are profitable. Thus, the future of the involvement of private commercial banks in microfinance \nin Sri Lanka is questionable.   \n\n  4\n\n\fpoor  and  do  so  in  a  cost-effective  manner,  compared  with  other  forms  of  poverty \ntargeting interventions. If public policy is to encourage the transformation of NGOs into \nregulated  financial  institutions  or  if  the  delivery  of  small  loans  is  to  be  left  to  the \ncommercial  banking  sector,  the  concern  that  the  client  base  will  change  so  that  poor \nclients are excluded by application of tighter commercial criteria must be addressed. In \nsuch  instances  there  is  a  need  to  learn  more  about  the  poverty  consequences  of  the \nongoing changes in the MFI sector in many countries. \n\n3.  Poverty and Microfinance \n\nHere, we define poverty as an income (or more broadly welfare) level below a socially \nacceptable  minimum,  and  microfinance  as  one  of  a  range  of  innovative  financial \narrangements  designed  to  attract  the  poor  as  either  borrowers  or  savers.  In  terms  of \nunderstanding poverty, a simple distinction can be drawn within \u2018the poor\u2019 between the \nlong-term  or  \u2018chronic  poor\u2019  and  those  who  temporarily  fall  into  poverty  as  a  result  of \nadverse shocks (\u2018transitory poor\u2019). Within the chronic poor, one can further distinguish \nbetween  those  who  are  either  so  physically  or  socially  disadvantaged  that  without \nwelfare support they will always remain in poverty (the \u2018destitute\u2019) and the larger group \nwho are poor because of a lack of assets and opportunities. Furthermore within the non-\ndestitute  category,  one  may  distinguish  by  the  depth  of  poverty  (that  is  how  far \nhouseholds are below the poverty line) with those significantly below it representing the \n\u2018core  poor\u2019,  sometimes  categorized  by  the  irregularity  of  their  income.  In  some  Latin \nAmerican cases, for example, the core poor or destitute are taken to be those below 50% \nof  the  poverty  line  (although  Latin  American  poverty  lines  are  generally  higher  than \nthose in Asia). \n\nIn principle, microfinance can relate to the chronic (non-destitute) poor and to \nthe  transitory  poor  in  different  ways.  The  condition  of  poverty  has  been  interpreted \nconventionally as one of lack of access by poor households to the assets necessary for a \nhigher standard of income or welfare, whether assets are thought of as human (access to \neducation), natural (access to land), physical (access to infrastructure), social (access to \nnetworks of obligations) or financial (access to credit) (World Bank 2000:34).  Lack of \naccess to credit is readily understandable in terms of the absence of collateral that the \npoor can offer conventional financial institutions, in addition to the various complexities \nand  high  costs  involved  in  dealing  with  large  numbers  of  small,  often  illiterate, \nborrowers.  The  poor  have  thus  to  rely  on  loans  from  either  moneylenders  at  high \ninterest rates or friends and family, whose supply of funds is limited. MFIs attempt to \novercome these barriers through innovative measures such as group lending and regular \nsavings  schemes,  as  well  as  the  establishment  of  close  links  between  poor  clients  and \nstaff  of  the  institutions  concerned.  The  range  of  possible  relationships  and  the \nmechanisms employed are very wide.  \n\nThe case for microfinance as a mechanism for poverty reduction is simple. If \naccess to credit can be improved, it is argued, the poor can finance productive activities \nthat will allow income growth, provided there are no other binding constraints. This is a \nroute out of poverty for the non-destitute chronic poor. For the transitory poor, who are \nvulnerable to fluctuations in income that bring them close to or below the poverty line, \nmicrofinance provides the possibility of credit at times of need and in some schemes the \nopportunity  of  regular  savings  by  a  household  itself  that  can  be  drawn  on.  The \n\n  5\n\n\favoidance of sharp declines in family expenditures by drawing on such credit or savings \nallows  \u2018consumption  smoothing.\u2019  In  practice  this  distinction  between  the  needs  of  the \nchronic  and  transitory  poor  for  credit  for  \u2018promotional\u2019  (that  is  income  creating)  and \n\u2018protectional\u2019 (consumption smoothing) purposes, respectively, is over-simplified since \nthe chronic poor also have short term needs that have to be met, whether they are due to \nincome  shortfalls  or  unexpected  expenditures  like  medical  bills  or  social  events  like \nweddings  or  funerals.  One  of  the  most  interesting  generalizations  to  emerge  from  the \nmicrofinance  and  poverty  literature  is  that  the  poorest  of  the  chronic  poor  (the  core \npoor)  borrow  essentially  for  protectional  purposes  given  both  the  low  and  irregular \nnature  of  their  income.  This  group,  it  is  suggested,  is  too  risk  averse  to  borrow  for \npromotional measures (that is for investment in the future) and therefore is only a very \nlimited beneficiary of microfinance schemes (Hulme and Mosley 1996: 132). \n\nThe  view  that  it  is  the  less  badly-off  poor  who  benefit  principally  from \nmicrofinance has become highly influential and, for example, was repeated in the World \nDevelopment Report on poverty  (World Bank 2000:75). Apart from the risk aversion \nargument noted above a number of other explanations for this outcome have been put \nforward.  A  related  issue  refers  to  the  interest  rates  charged  to  poor  borrowers.  Most \nmicrofinance schemes charge close to market-clearing interest rates (although these are \noften not enough to ensure full cost-recovery given the high cost per loan of small-scale \nlending).    It  may  be  that,  even  setting  aside  the  argument  of  risk  aversion,  such  high \nrates  are  unaffordable  to  the  core  poor  given  their  lack  of  complementary  inputs.  In \nother  words,  despite  their  having  a  smaller  amount  of  capital,  marginal  returns  to  the \ncore poor may be lower than those to the better-off poor. If the core poor cannot afford \nhigh  interest  rates,  they  will  either  not  take  up  the  service  or  take  it  up  and  get  into \nfinancial difficulties. Also, where group lending is used, the very poor may be excluded \nby other members of the group, because they are seen as a bad credit risk, jeopardizing \nthe position of the group as a whole. Alternatively, when professional staff operate as \nloan officers, they may exclude the very poor from borrowing, again on the grounds of \nrepayment risk. In combination, these factors, it is felt by many, explain the weakness of \nmicrofinance in reaching the core poor.5 The sector has responded in a number of cases \nby establishing special programs for the core or \u2018ultra poor\u2019. The best known of these \nare in Bangladesh and involve the well-established institutions of BRAC and ASA. The \nprograms  essentially  aim  to  provide  a  range  of  services,  covering  training,  health \nprovision and more general social development for the disadvantaged, as well as grants \nof  assets  or  credits.  The  ultra  poor  are  encouraged  to  build  up  a  savings  fund  and  to \ngraduate  to  conventional  microfinance  programs.  Other  variants  of  this  approach \ninvolve greater flexibility in repayment terms for the poorest (Fernando 2004). \n\nGiven  the  new  trends  in  the  sector  and  their  possible  effect  in  diluting  the \noriginal  poverty  focus  of  MFIs,  the  question  of  their  impact  on  the  poor  (and \n\n                                                 \n5 An  important  attempt  to  address  this  problem  has  been  the  Income  Generation  for  Vulnerable  Group \nDevelopment  (IGVGD) program  run  by  BRAC  in  Bangladesh, which  combines  measures  of  livelihood \nprotection (food aid) with livelihood promotion (skills training and micro credit). Hence micro credit is \nprovided  as  part  of  a  package  approach.  Matin  and  Hulme  (2003)  survey  the  evidence  on  how  far  the \nbenefits of this program actually reach the core poor and conclude that although the program was more \nsuccessful than more conventional micro credit schemes, nonetheless many target households were still \nmissed.  \n\n  6\n\n\fparticularly the core poor) is clearly of great policy interest. It might be thought that if \nsuch institutions are designed to serve only poor clients and if repayment rates are high, \nno  further  detailed  analysis  is  needed.  Such  a  view  is  misleading  for  a  number  of \nreasons.  First,  there  is  no  guarantee  that  only  the  poor  will  be  served  unless  strong \neligibility  criteria  (such  as  land  ownership)  are  enforced.  Often  the  aim  is  to  dissuade \nthe non-poor through the inconvenience of frequent meetings or the stigma of being a \nmember of a credit group of the poor. Such disincentives need not work and eligibility \ncriteria,  where  they  exist,  may  not  be  enforced.  Second,  high  repayment  rates  may  be \ndue to social pressure within a group or family and may not reflect the capacity to repay \n(if for example loans from moneylenders have to be taken out to repay the micro credit). \nThird,  even  if  the  poor  are  genuinely  served  by  MFIs,  as  long  as  public  funds  are \nrequired  to  finance  the  MFI,  there  is  the  issue  of  how  cost-effective  this  means  of \nreaching the poor is compared with alternatives. This requires a comparison of the cost \nof transferring the funds through a micro credit institution per unit of benefit received \nby the target group, as compared with the benefit-cost ratio for alternative schemes for \nreaching  the  core  poor,  such  as  food  subsidies,  workfare,  and  integrated  regional \ndevelopment  initiatives.  Such  comparisons  must  take  account  of  not  just  the \nadministrative costs involved, but also the leakage rate (that is, the benefits to the non-\npoor).  \n\nHence for these reasons there is a strong case in favor of attempting to assess \nboth  the  depth  of  outreach  of  microfinance  programs,  the  impact  of  access  to \nmicrofinance services on the welfare of clients and the costs of achieving this impact. \n\nOn  the  first  point,  assessing  the  depth  of  outreach  or  access  of  the  poor  to \nmicrofinance programs, it is important to note from the outset that most MFIs probably \ndo  not  consider  their  institutional  mission  to  be  serving  the  poorest  of  the  poor.  \nParticularly in Latin America, most MFIs report a broader agenda to provide financial \nservices  to  poor  communities  or  specific  groups  such  as  female  entrepreneurs  who \nwould not otherwise have access.  Among MFIs that report to the Mix Market, slightly \nless  than  half  of  those  in  Asia  identified  \u201cspecifically  targeting  very  poor  clients\u201d  as \ntheir  institutional  mission.    In  Latin  America,  the  share  is  even  smaller:  only  around \n10%.  Of the Latin American MFIs that claim to target very poor clients, only two use \nsome  sort  of  targeting  tool  to  identify  clients.    In  Asia,  most  of  those  specifically \ntargeting  the  very  poor  use  some  sort  of  targeting  tool,  such  as  a  means  test, \nparticipatory wealth ranking or a housing index to identify the target group.   \n\nFor  those  MFIs  that  do  explicitly  aim  to  serve  the  poorest  within  their \ncommunity,  recent  work  on  poverty  outreach  of  MFIs  has  focused  on  constructing  a \npoverty index that can be used to establish whether the target group is being reached. \nThe  Consultative  Group  to  Assist  the  Poorest  (CGAP)  has  developed  a  poverty \nassessment tool (PAT) that can be used to compare clients and non-clients of MFIs in \nthe  same  community.  This  is  done  through  the  construction  of  a  weighted  index  of \npoverty  based  on  a  range  of  indicators  covering  the  human  resources  of  households, \ncharacteristics  of  their  dwellings,  measures  of  food  security  and  assets.    The  different \nindicators  are  weighted  by  principal  components  analysis,  which  allows  weights  to \ndiffer between cases (Zeller et al 2001). The approach here is to sort a non-client sample \ninto three equal groups (high, intermediate and low) on the basis of their poverty score. \nThe poverty index scores at the cut-off points between the three groups then become a \n\n  7\n\n\freference  point  for  the  client  or  participant  sample  and  their  distribution  between  the \nthree categories can be compared with that of the non-clients. As the non-client groups \nare divided equally, any deviation from equal proportions amongst the clients signals a \nskew either for or against greater poverty outreach.6  \n\nThe PAT is an assessment of outreach, rather than impact, and therefore does \nnot  directly  address  the  question  of  what  impact  the  programs  have  on  their  clients. \nConducting  a  rigorous  impact  assessment  is  challenging.    It  is  not  simply  a  case  of \nlooking  at  a  group  of  borrowers,  observing  their  income  change  after  they  take  out \nmicro loans and establishing who has risen above the poverty line. Accurate assessment \nrequires a rigorous test of the counterfactual\u2014that is how income (or whatever measure \nis used) with a micro credit compares with what it would be without  it,  with  the  only \ndifference in the two cases being the availability of credit. This requires empirically a \ncontrol group identical in characteristics to the recipients of credit and engaged in the \nsame  productive  activities,  who  have  not  received  credit,  and  whose  income  (or  other \nmeasure) can be traced through time to compare with that of the credit recipients.  \n\nA practitioner-friendly impact assessment toolkit is also available: the result of \nthe Assessing the Impact of Microenterprise Services (AIMS) Project.  This assessment \ntool has been used in longitudinal studies of the impact of programs in Peru (Mibanco), \nIndia (SEWA) and Zimbabwe (Zambuko Trust).  This procedure looks at change over \ntime  and  matches  pairs  of  observations  between  borrowers  and  members  of  a  control \ngroup, where each pair have similar starting values for the impact variable (like income \nor  sales  revenue)  and  other  characteristics,  like  age,  gender  or  sector  of  activity.  \nSimplifying, this approach identifies impact as: \n\n \nImpact   =   1/n \u03a3 (Yt+1   -  Yt )p \n \nWhere  Yt  and  Y  t+1  are  an  impact  variable  (like  income)  in  period  t  and  t  +1 \nrespectively, and p refers to matched pairs of borrowers and non-borrowers, where there \nare n pairs. Thus impact can be rationalized as the average difference between matched \npairs of program participants and control group.7 Where impact is greater than zero (and \nstatistically  significant)  microfinance  will  have  made  a  difference  and  once  again \ninitially  poor  and  non-poor  borrowers  can  be  distinguished  in  the  analysis.  The \nweakness in the applications of this approach to date is that researchers have only been \nable to control for observable characteristics.  \n\nFailure to account for unobservable characteristics may lead to biased measures \nof impact.  Two key sources of bias can arise in empirical work that attempts to assess \n                                                 \n6 CGAP  reports  that  the  CGAP-PAT  has  been  used  to  assess  the  relative  poverty  level  of  clients  of  7 \nMFIs\u20142  of  these  are  in  Asia  and  2  in  Latin  America.    Three  of  these  MFIs  who  explicitly  identify \nserving  the  poorest  of  the  poor  as  an  institutional  mission  appear  to  be  succeeding  in  that  goal.  \nInstitutions with broader goals tended to serve a clientele that is more representative of the communities \nin which they operate, which may or may not be poorer than the national average.  \n7 The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) essentially allows separate parallel regression lines to be fitted \nthrough  the  data  for  the  treatment  (borrower)  and  control  groups.  The  regression  lines  measure  the \noutcome  variable  for  a  given  year  (t  +  n)  relative  to  an  earlier  year  (t).  Insofar  as  a  program  like \nmicrocredit has a tangible effect this will be picked up by the distance between the two lines, that is by \nthe difference in intercept terms. The statistical significance of this distance gives a test for the impact of \nthe program. \n\n  8\n\n\fthe impact of micro credit on poor households\u2014selection bias and placement bias.  The \nformer  arises  where  there  are  key  differences  between  borrowers  and  non-borrowers \nthat  cannot  be  observed,  measured  and  allowed  for,  with  self-selection  bias  (that  is \nwhere those with  particular characteristics  choose  to  participate in a program) being a \nkey problem. Hence whilst differences in education, age or gender can be controlled for \nstatistically, there can also be differences in attitude to risk or \u2018entrepreneurship\u2019, which \nwill be basically unobservable. A bias will arise if there is an association between the \ndecision to take a micro loan and these unobserved characteristics. For instance, if the \nmore entrepreneurial individuals are those who take out loans, growth in their income \nrelative to that of those who have not taken out a loan may be due in part to the effect of \nthe loan itself, but in part to their entrepreneurial ability. Attribution of all of the change \nto the loan will overstate its impact.  Placement bias arises where loans go to locations \nor activities that are in some way favored, such as villages with better infrastructure or \nsectors  with  strong  demand  growth.  Comparing  income  change  for  households  in  a \nsuperior  location  (or  sector)  who  have  a  loan,  with  income  change  for  similar \nhouseholds  in  another  location  (or  sector),  who  have  not  taken  out  a  loan,  and \nattributing of all this to the loan will create an upward bias.  \n\nBest-practice  approaches  to  resolving  these  problems  employ  a  form  of \n\u201cdifference-in-difference\u201d (two-stage least squares instrumental variables) analysis that \ncompares participants and a similar control group and between locations or sectors with \nand  without  access  to  the  program.8 One  approach  (as  used  for  example  by  Pitt  and \nKhandker [1998] on Bangladesh) is to use exogenous eligibility criteria for participation \nin a microfinance program (for example lack of land ownership) as a means of avoiding \na self-selection bias. A placement bias is avoided by comparing those who are eligible \nwith those who are ineligible, both in villages that are covered by programs and those \nthat  are  not.  Hence  the  analysis  based  on  a  double  difference  can  be  simplified  as \nfollows \n\nImpact  =  (Yep  -  Yip)  -   (Yen -  Yin)   \n \nWhere  Y  is  change  in  an  outcome  measure  (such  as  income)  over  the  study \nperiod,  e  and  i  stand  for  eligible  and  ineligible  households,  respectively,  and  p  and  n \nstand for program and non-program villages, respectively. For microfinance to produce \npositive results, Impact must be greater than zero. If poor and non-poor borrowers can \nbe identified, there will be a quantification of the poverty impact. \n\nThe  chief  problem  with  this  approach  is  that  many  microfinance  schemes  do \nnot  use  formal  eligibility  criteria  and  those  that  do  may  not  always  enforce  them, \ncreating a further source of error. An alternative where no formal criteria are set out but \napprovals for borrowing are known is to use as a control group those approved for loans \nwho have not yet taken them up (for example as used by Mosley and Hulme [1996] in \ntheir country studies). This addresses the self-selection issue, unless not taking up a loan \nreveals an aversion to risk and is correlated with subsequent outcomes.  \n\nA variant of this approach (as applied by Coleman [1999, 2004] for Thailand) \ndraws on the fact that most microfinance activities start in a narrowly defined area and \nthen expand their coverage to similar villages elsewhere or within urban centers. In the \n\n                                                 \n8 This discussion draws extensively on Coleman (2001). \n\n  9\n\n\frural case, if the villages are similar and if the borrowers can choose to participate, then \nself-selecting  participants  in  villages  that  have  been  identified  for  later  inclusion  in  a \nprogram should provide an accurate control group for current borrowers in villages with \na program. Here, again simplifying, this is equivalent to estimating impact as  \n\n \nImpact  =  (YPt+1  -  YNt+1) - (YPt  -  YNt)   \n \nWhere Y is as before, P and N stand for (self-selecting) participants and non-\nparticipants respectively, t stands for time a program has been operative in a particular \nvillage, so t + 1 covers the early and t the late entrant villages. \n\nHere we examine some of the recent \u2018rigorous\u2019 studies on the impact of MFIs \nbased on survey data that employ versions of these methodologies. We do not report the \nresults  of  work  based  on  more  qualitative  or  participatory  approaches. 9  Table  2 \nsummarizes the results of the studies surveyed here for Asia, and Table 3 does the same \nfor  Latin  America.  In  general,  it  is  perhaps  not  surprising  that  studies  based  on  a \nrigorous  counterfactual  find  much  smaller  gains  from  microfinance  than  simple \nunadjusted  before-and-after  type  comparisons, which  erroneously  attribute  all  gains  to \nmicro credit. Also, although the results are far from consistent, studies on Asia tend to \nreport a stronger poverty impact from microfinance than do comparable ones from Latin \nAmerica. \n \n \n\nTable 2.

Poverty Impact Studies: Asia \n\nOne  of  the  early  and  most  widely  cited  of  the  poverty  impact  studies  is  Hulme  and \nMosley (1996). It employs a control group approach looking at the changes in income \nfor  households  in  villages  with  microfinance  programs  and  changes  for  similar \nhouseholds (for example, in terms of initial income, gender, education, and location) in \nnon-program  areas.  As  far  as  possible,  the  control  groups  are  drawn  from  households \n\n 14\n\n\feligible for loans who have been approved for loans by the institutions concerned, but \nwho  have  not  yet  received  a  loan.  Programs  in  a  number  of  countries  are  considered \nincluding  the  Grameen  Bank  in  Bangladesh  and  the  Bank  Rakyat  Indonesia  (BRI).  In \ngeneral, a positive impact is found on borrower incomes of the poor (1988-92) with an \naverage increase over the control groups ranging from 10-12% in Indonesia, to around \n30% in Bangladesh and India  (Hulme and Mosley 1996, table 8.1). Gains are larger for \nnon-poor  borrowers,  however,  and  within  the  group  the  poor  gains  are  negatively \ncorrelated with income. However, despite the breadth of the study and its use of control \ngroup techniques, it has been criticized for possible placement bias, since microfinance \nprograms may be drawn to better placed villages, so that part of the advantage relative \nto  the  control  group  may  be  due  to  this  more  favorable  location.  The  quality  and \naccuracy of some of the data, particularly in relation to the representative nature of the \ncontrol groups, has been questioned (Morduch 1999:1600). There also appears to be a \nbasic  problem  with  the  data  side  of  the  case  studies,  since  they  are  not  based  on  a \ncomparison  between  baseline  data  and  that  for  a  later  survey  year.  Rather  there  is  at \nleast partial recourse to a recall approach for the earlier years of the period covered, as \nrespondents  are  asked  to  estimate  their  income  retrospectively.  Finally,  the  major \nconclusion  of  the  study  that there  is  a  positive  correlation of  gains  from  microfinance \nwith  income,  so  that  poorer  borrowers  gain  proportionately  less,  has  also  been \nchallenged  on  the  grounds  that  their  comparison  of  income  changes  for  different \ncategories of borrowers biases their results in favor of the conclusion.  This is because \ngains  for  different  income  groups  are  compared  with  the  average  for  a  control  group, \nrather than with the change for comparable income categories within the control group; \nin  other  words,  gains  to  very  poor  borrowers  are  compared  with  average  gains  in  the \ncontrol group, and not to the gains to the very poor controls (Morduch 2003). \n\nAnother major early initiative that provides some of the firmest empirical work \nis  the  surveys  conducted  in  the  1990s  by  the  Bangladesh  Institute  of  Development \nStudies (BIDS) and the World Bank; these provided the data for several major analyses, \nsuch as Pitt and Khandker (1998).  Khandker (1998) summarizes a number of different \nstudies  conducted  in  Bangladesh  using  the  1991/92  survey,  focusing  on  three  major \nmicrofinance  programs,  including  the  Grameen  Bank  and  the  Bangladesh  Rural \nAdvancement  Committee  (BRAC).  As  discussed  above,  impact  is  assessed  using  a \ndouble-difference  approach  between  eligible  and  ineligible  households  (with  holdings \nof land of more than half an acre making households ineligible) and between program \nand  non-program  villages.  After  controlling  for  other  factors,  such  as  household \ncharacteristics, any remaining difference is attributed to the microfinance programs. The \nstudy  draws  a  number  of  conclusions,  but  the  main  one  is  that  the  program  had  a \npositive  effect  on  household  consumption,  which  was  significantly  greater  for  female \nborrowers. On average, a loan of 100 taka to a female borrower, after it is repaid, allows \na net consumption increases of 18 taka. In terms of poverty impact, it is estimated that \n5% of participant households are pulled above the poverty line annually.  \n\nKhandker  (2003)  follows  up  this  earlier  work  employing  panel  data.  He  uses \nthe BIDS - World Bank survey conducted in 1998-99 that traces the same households \nfrom  the  1991-92  survey.    He  finds  apparently  strong  and  positive  results.  Whilst \nborrowing  by  males  appears  to  have  no  significant  impact  on  consumption,  that  by \nfemales,  who  are  the  dominant  client  group,  does  have  a  positive  impact.  From  this \n\n 15\n\n\fanalysis,  a  100  taka loan  to a  female  client is  found  to  lead  to  a  10.5  taka  increase  in \nconsumption (compared with 18 taka in the earlier analysis). Allowing for the impact of \nhigher  consumption  on  poverty  gives  estimates  of  poverty  impact.  It  is  estimated  that \ndue  to  participation  in  microfinance  programs,  moderate  poverty  among  program \nparticipants  decreased  by  8.5  percentage  points  over  the  period  of  seven  years  and \nextreme poverty dropped about 18 points over the same period.10 He also finds evidence \nof positive spillovers on non-program participants in the villages, with the impact being \ngreater for those in extreme poverty. Over the study period of seven years, poverty for \nnon-participants is found to decline by 1 percentage point due to the programs, whilst \nextreme  poverty  declines  by  nearly  5  percentage  points.  This  impact  is  due  solely  to \nfemale borrowing. \n\nThe same data set has also been used to identify health impacts as opposed to \nincome  changes.  Pitt  et  al  (2003)  find  that  credit  going  to  females  has  a  large  and \nsignificant impact in two out of three health measures for children. Male borrowing has \nno  such  effect.  For  example,  a  10%  increase  in  credit  to  females  increases  the  arm \ncircumference  of  daughters  by  6.3%.  A  10%  increase  in  female  credit  on  average \nincreases the height of girls by 0.36 cm annually and of boys by 0.50 cm. The relations \nare stronger for daughters than sons. Hence in Bangladesh, micro credit and improved \nfamily health appear to be related. \n\nThese are strong and positive results and are probably the clearest evidence that \nmicrofinance  is  working  in  the  way  intended  to  bring  sustained  relief  from  poverty. \nHowever a couple of caveats are in order. First, the accuracy of the original results as \npresented  in  Pitt  and  Khandker  (1998)  has  been  disputed  on  the  grounds  that  the \neligibility  criteria  of  low  land  holdings  was  not  enforced  strictly  in  practice.  In  a \nreworking of the results focusing on what are claimed to be more directly comparable \nhouseholds,  no  impact  on  consumption  from  participation  in  a  program  is  found \n(Morduch 1999:1605).11 Second, in the BIDs-World Bank survey data, the \u2018ultra poor\u2019 \n(defined as those with less than 0.2 acres of land) form nearly 60% of participants and \nthe  likelihood  of  participation  is  strongly  negatively  associated  with  the  level  of  land \nholding.  Nonetheless,  how  much \nthe \nentrepreneurship  of  households,  so  that  the  charge  that  the  risk-averse  very  poor  will \nbenefit proportionately less has not been totally dispelled.  Furthermore, the panel data \nreveal a relatively high dropout rate of around 30%, indicating that there may have been \nproblems of repayment for many households. \n\nis  borrowed  depends  principally  on \n\nFor Asia, there are examples of studies that are either inconclusive or provide \nless  convincing  results.  Coleman  (1999)  and  MkNelly  et  al  (1996)  both  focus  on \nexperiences with village banking in Thailand. Coleman (1999) utilizes data on villages \nthat  participated  in  village  bank  microfinance  schemes  and  control  villages  that  were \ndesignated  as  participants,  but  had  not  yet  participated.  As  noted  above,  this  allows  a \ndouble  difference  approach  that  compares  the  difference  between  income  for \nparticipants  and  non-participants  in  program  villages  with  the  same  difference  in  the \ncontrol  villages,  where  the  programs  were  introduced  later.  From  the  results  here,  the \n                                                 \n10 Poverty is based on a daily calorie intake of 2112 and extreme poverty on one of 1739. \n11 This debate, which in part centers around details of econometric estimation, has not been resolved. An \nunpublished paper by Pitt reworks the original analysis to address the concerns of Morduch and is said to \nconfirm the original results (Khandker 2003, footnote 1). \n\n 16\n\n\fpoverty  impact  of  the  schemes  appears  highly  dubious.  Months  of  village  bank \nmembership have no impact on any asset or income variables and there is no evidence \nthat  village  bank  loans  were  directed  to  productive  purposes.  The  small  size  of  loans \nmeans  that  they  were  largely  used  for  consumption,  but  one  of  the  reasons  there  is  a \nweak poverty impact is that there was a tendency for wealthier households to self-select \ninto village banks. \n\nColeman  (2004)  uses  the  same  survey  data  but  reconsiders  the  estimation \nstrategy  to  control  for  self-selection.  He  argues  that  the  village  bank  methodology, \nwhich  relies  on  self-selection  by  loan  size  and  monitoring  by  frequent  meetings,  may \nnot  reach  the  poorest.  As  many  better-off  households  tend  to  be  on  village  bank \ncommittees,  the  failure  to  control  for  this  leads  to  systematic  biases.  The  regression \nresults  of  Coleman  (2004)  indicate  that  there  is  a  substantial  difference  between \nordinary members and committee members of village banks. The impact of micro credit \non ordinary members\u2019 wellbeing is either insignificantly different from zero or negative. \nOn  the  contrary,  the  impact  of  microfinance  programs  on  committee  members\u2019 \nmeasures  of  wealth,  such  as  income,  savings,  productive  expenses  and  labor  time  is \npositive,  implying  a  form  of  program  capture  by  the  better-off  in  the  village,  even \nthough this group may not be well-off by national standards. A similar result in terms of \nrationing micro credit in favor of better-off groups or members is found by Doung and \nIzumida (2002) in a study of six villages in Vietnam. There, whilst credit availability is \nlinked  with  production  and  income,  household  economic  position  and  prestige  in  a \nvillage plus the amount of credit applied for are the main determinants of how credit is \nallocated. \n\nMkNelly et al (1996) evaluate the Freedom from Hunger credit with education \nprogram in Thailand operated through village banks. The results show positive benefits. \nHowever, although non-participants in non-program villages are used as controls, there \nare  problems  in  accepting  the  results.  No  statistical  tests  are  reported,  so  one  cannot \njudge  whether  differences  between  participants  and  non-participants  are  significant.  \nThere is also a potential measurement bias, since the staff responsible for the program \nalso did the interviewing. \n\nChen  and  Snodgrass  (2001)  examine  the  operations  of  the  Self  Employed \nWomen\u2019s  Association  (SEWA)  bank  in  India,  which  provides  low-income  female \nclients in the informal sector with both saving and loan services. The study tests for the \nimpact  of  these  services  by  comparing  the  bank\u2019s  clients  against  a  randomly  selected \ncontrol  group  in  a  similar  geographic  area.  Two  surveys  were  conducted  two  years \napart.  Average  incomes  rose  over  time  for  all  groups\u2014borrowers,  savers  and  the \ncontrol, although the increase was less for the latter. In terms of poverty incidence, there \nwas little overall change, although there was substantial \u2018churning\u2019, in that amongst the \nclients  of  SEWA  there  was  significant  movement  above  or  below  the  poverty  line.  In \ninterpreting these results, Meyer (2002) argues that the evidence on the counterfactual\u2014\nthat  is  what  would  have  happened  to  the  clients  in  the  absence  of  the  services  of \nSEWA\u2014is not sufficiently strong to draw any firm conclusions on poverty impact. \n\nThe  smoothing  of  consumption  over  time  to  protect  the  poor  against  adverse \nshocks  is  one  of  the  principle  objectives  of  micro  credit.  Using  data  again  for \n\n 17\n\n\fBangladesh, Amin et al (2003) compute several measures  of  vulnerability.12 They  find \nthat the micro credit participants in the two villages covered are more likely to be below \nthe  poverty  line  than  if  they  had  been  selected  at  random,  and  conclude  that  the \nprograms  have  reached  the  poor.  However,  the  vulnerable  are  more  likely  to  join  a \nmicro credit program in only one of the two villages. Further, for the vulnerable below \nthe  poverty  line,  in  one  village  there  is  no  evidence  that  they  are  more  likely  to  be \nmembers  of a program and in the other  village there is  evidence  that  they  have either \nchosen not to join or are actively excluded, presumably on the grounds that they are a \npoor credit risk. Hence the very poor and vulnerable do not appear to be reached.  \n\nMore  positive  conclusions  in  terms  of  the  ability  of  microfinance  to  reduce \nvulnerability  are  found  for  Indonesia  by  Gertler  et  al  (2003),  who  find  that  access  to \nmicrofinance helps households smooth consumption in the face of declines in the health \nof adult family members. Having established an empirical relationship between health \ncondition and consumption, the authors test for a relation between access to a financial \ninstitution  and  consumption  shortfalls  associated  with  ill  health.  Using  geographic \ndistance  as  a  measure  of  access,  they  find  that  for  households  in  an  area  with  a  BRI \nbranch, health shocks have no effect on consumption.  This study does not differentiate \nwithin the group of the poor. \n\n3.2.  Poverty Impact Studies: Latin America \n\nIn Latin America in general, the impact of microfinance on poverty has been less well \ndocumented  both  in  a  methodological  sense  and  in  terms  of  coverage  in  individual \nstudies,  which  tend  to  be  concentrated  in  a  small  number  of  countries,  principally \nBolivia  and  Peru.  The  overall  impression,  however,  is  that  compared  with  Asia, \nmicrofinance  has  reached  less  far  down  the  income  scale  and  that  a  significant \nproportion of borrowers are not in fact below the poverty line, although they may well \nhave  below  average  incomes.  This  is  likely  to  be  due  at  least  in  part  to  a  greater \ncommercial  orientation  with  a  focus  on  credit  for  urban  micro-enterprises,  with  lower \nrural outreach in Latin America as compared with other regions. A typical requirement \nfor access to credit from an MFI has been that the borrower should be the owner of a \nmicro-enterprise, holding a national identification card and having at least six to twelve \nmonths experience in the economic activity for which the loan is to be used (Gulli and \nBerger  1999:26).  It  is  perhaps  not  surprising  that  many  of  the  poor  do  not  meet  these \ncriteria.  \n\nFor example, detailed evidence on the outreach of MFIs in Bolivia is provided \nby  the  survey  reported  in  Navajas  et  al  (2000),  who  use  an  index  of  basic  needs \nfulfillment to classify borrowers into poor and non-poor groups. For the urban area of \nLa Paz, they find that two of three MFIs tend to lend disproportionately to those above \nof the poverty line. For two of the three, the share of \u2018moderately poor\u2019 borrowers (at \n29%) is lower than their share of the population (at 38%), although this is not the case \nfor the third MFI, BancoSol (at 47%). However of the very poorest group, the share of \nborrowers in all three institutions (at 2-5%) is well below their share in the population, \nreinforcing  the  view  that  MFIs  have  difficulty  in  reaching  the  very  poor.  When  rural \n                                                 \n12 Unlike  the  Khandker  studies,  these  data  choose  households  before  they  join  a  micro  credit  scheme. \nTheir vulnerability measure is broader than simply fluctuations in consumption. \n\n 18\n\n\flending activities are also included there is a tendency for a skew in lending towards the \n\u2018threshold\u2019  group,  defined  as  those  just  above  the  poverty  line  and  the  \u2018moderately\u2019 \npoor. Table 4 gives the ratio of the share of groups of borrowers by poverty class in the \nportfolio of the different MFIs to their share in total population. A figure above unity \nindicates  a  positive  skew  towards  a  particular  poverty  class,  and  a  figure  below  unity \nindicates the opposite. \n\nIn  terms  of  institutional  mix  FIE,  PRODEM  and  Sartawi  are  NGOs,  whilst \nBancoSol  and  Caja  Los  Andes  are  regulated  financial  institutions.  Table  4  shows  that \nbeing an NGO (like FIE) is no guarantee of a strong allocation of loans to the poor and \nthat both regulated institutions have a superior distribution to FIE. However in turn the \nrural-based NGOs, PRODEM and Sartawi outperform BancoSol by these criteria.  \n \n \n\nTable 4.

Among the limited number of detailed \npoverty impact studies on Latin America, BancoSol of Bolivia remains by far the most \nstudied  institution.  Hulme  and  Mosley  (1996,  Table  4.1)  look  at  a  small  sample  of \nBancoSol borrowers. Using approved borrowers who had not yet taken out a loan as a \ncontrol, they find an average annual increase in income of 28% for borrowers compared \nwith an average of 14.5% for the control group. An estimated 8% of borrowers crossed \nthe  poverty  line  in  1992  alone.  However  in  comparison  with  the  MFIs  from  other \ncountries in their study, BancoSol had only a relatively small proportion of borrowers in \nthe sample below the poverty line (29%) and average borrower household income from \nthe sample was nearly five times the national poverty line, a figure far higher than for \nany  institution  studied  in  other  countries.  BancoSol  also  showed  the  largest  average \nabsolute income increase for borrowers, and the proportionate increases were greater for \nthe poor. Although the Hulme and Mosley study has a reasonable control group criteria \n(approved borrowers who had not yet taken out a loan, but who might be expected to \nshare  the  self-selection  characteristics  of  current  borrowers)  it  suffers  from  several \nproblems:  there  is  only  a  small  sample  of  36  borrowers;  it  is  not  clear  whether  the \n\n 19\n\n\fcontrol group matches borrowers exactly in terms of characteristics such as education, \ngender  or  sector  of  activity;  and  the  sample  is  surveyed  at  a  point  in  time  so  that \nretrospective income estimates are required to derive rates of change. \n\nThe  last  of  these  problems  is  addressed  for  BancoSol,  but  not  the  other \nBolivian  MFIs  covered,  in  Mosley  (2001),  which  resurveys  the  households  covered \nearlier  to  obtain  income  data  at  two  points  in  time.  Mosley  (2001)  finds  that  for \nBancoSol  borrowers  re-surveyed,  on  average  income  growth  was  a  little  more  than \ntwice (214%) that of the control group; for the other three institutions the excess income \ngrowth  for  borrowers  over  the  control  group  was  between  132%  and  158%.  For  poor \nborrowers (who were a minority of those surveyed) gains relative to the average for the \ncontrol  group  were  lower  than  for  all  borrowers,  for  example  151%  in  the  case  of \nBancoSol.  Regression  analysis  relating  income  increase  per  household  relative  to  the \ncontrol  group  average  to  initial  income  shows  a  positive  relationship,  so  that \nproportionate gains from borrowing rise with household income, although at a declining \nrate. There is a positive poverty impact, although given the fact that only a minority of \nborrowers (around one third) were poor at the starting point of the analysis in 1993, this \nis modest. Between 10%\u201320% of poor borrowers, varying between institutions, crossed \nthe poverty line over the period studied as a result of microfinance.13 However when the \ncore  poor  (those  in  \u2018extreme  poverty\u2019  defined  in  Bolivia  as  those  living  on  half  the \npoverty line) are considered, it is clear that none of the MFIs studied are reaching them. \nFrom a sample of 200 borrowers over six years for four institutions, there is only one \ncase  of  the  removal  of  extreme  poverty.  Hence,  this  segment  of  the  poor  was  not \nreached. \n\nDunn and Arbuckle (2001a, 2001b) use an analysis of covariance to examine \nloans  to  micro-enterprises  for  305  households  in  Lima,  Peru  by  Mibanco.  The  study \ndraws  on  data  at  two  points  in  time  (1997  and  1999)  and  looks  at  changes  in  the \nborrowers  relative  to  a  control  group  of  households  who  had  not  received  a  micro-\nenterprise loan. On average, the borrower group appears to be around or slightly above \nthe national poverty line, with approximately 30% below the national poverty line. As \nnoted  above,  the  procedure  uses  matched  observations  in  the  borrower  and  control \ngroups  that  have  the  same  starting  values  for  performance  variables,  like  net  revenue, \nassets or employment, as well as the same values for \u2018moderating\u2019 variables, like gender \nof entrepreneur, sector of activity and location. Change in the performance variables for \nthe  matched  observations  over  1997\u20131999  are  compared  to  establish  if  there  are \nsignificant differences between the borrowers and the control group. The results suggest \non  average  a  significant  difference  in  terms  of  enterprise  revenue  (roughly  $1000 \nannually),  fixed  assets  and  employment  creation  (as  much  as  nine  extra  days  per \nmonth). These results are very substantial. The study however recognizes that it may be \ndifficult to attribute all of these changes to the micro credit program of Mibanco, as the \nmatching  system  used  does  not  adequately  address  self-selection  bias  and  the \nmoderating  variables  used  seem  crude  (for  example,  the  sector  variables  reported  are \n\n                                                 \n13 There is some ambiguity in the interpretation of poverty impact since the definition of the headcount \npoverty index in the notes to Table 5 in Mosley (2001) does not seem to match the explanation in the text. \nThis refers to between 10 and 20 per cent \u2018of borrowers\u2019 crossing the poverty line as a consequence of \nmicrofinance. We take this to mean \u2018of poor borrowers\u2019 given the low poverty outreach reported in Table \n5. \n\n 20\n\n\f\u2018commercial, service and industrial\u2019 rather than anything more precise such as industrial \nsubsectors).   \n\nThe poverty dimension of the study as reported in Dunn and Arbuckle (2001b) \nshows  a  positive  poverty  reduction  effect.  For  households  starting  with  the  same \npoverty level, number of income sources and economically active members in 1997, on \nbalance after net effects are allowed for by 1999, borrowers were 6% more likely to be \nabove the poverty line than non-borrowers. There is the contrary result, however, that in \nthe  smaller  group  of  new  borrowers  who  took  out  a  loan  during  1997\u20131999,  but  not \ninitially in 1997, new borrowers were 15% less likely to have moved out of poverty than \nthe control group.14 The poor and non-poor appear to benefit almost equally in absolute \nterms,  although  there  is  evidence  that  the  poorer  borrowers  were  20%  more  likely  to \nliquidate assets in response to a financial shock. \n\nBanegas  et  al  (2002)  look  at  the  operations  of  two  MFIs  in  Ecuador  (Banco \nSolidario) and Bolivia (Caja los Andes) utilizing the CGAP poverty index noted above \nto  establish  outreach  and  a  logit  regression  model  (where  being  a  client  and  taking  a \nloan  gives  a  dependent  variable  of  1.0  and  being  a  non-client  a  dependent  variable  of \nzero) that links participation in a program with income changes and poverty scores. It is \nfound  that  for  both  institutions,  taking  a  loan  is  associated  with  increases  in  income. \nHowever income change is measured not by the size of monetary values but by a simple \nscoring  system  (1  for  income  decrease,  2  for  unchanged  income  and  3  for  income \nincrease).  The  relation  with  poverty  varies  since  in  the  case  of  Banco  Solidario  lower \npoverty is associated with a greater probability of taking a loan, and in the case of Caja \nlos  Andes  with  a  higher  probability.  On  the  other  hand  Banco  Solidario  has  a  greater \ndepth of outreach, as 75% of its clients belonged to the lower and intermediate groups \nas  defined  by  the  CGAP  poverty  score,  as  compared  with  48%  for  Caja  los  Andes. \nAgain  it  seems  therefore  it  is  the  better-off  amongst  the  poor  who  are  benefiting. \nLimitations  of  this  analysis  are  the  crudity  of  some  of  the  indicators,  for  example  for \nincome  change,  and  the  way  in  which  a  control  group  of  non-clients  are  selected;  i.e. \nfrom households in the same locality that have micro-enterprises in the same sector as \nthe  borrowers  and  which  have  not  had  a  loan  from  a  formal  sector  institution.  This \nsimply  ignores  the  issue  of  self-selection  bias  and  does  not  control  for  factors  like \neducation and skills. \n\nFrom a nutritional perspective, MkNelly and Dunford (1999) look at the impact \nof  Credit  with  Education  loans  to  women  in  rural  Bolivia.  A  relatively  rigorous \napproach  is  applied  by  collecting  data  two  years  apart  from  a  participant  group  and  a \ncontrol  group,  who  would  be  offered  the  credit  at  the  end  of  the  study  period.  In \naddition, amongst the participants, a sub-group of those who joined during the course of \nthe study, rather than immediately, is examined separately. Small loans were available \nin  combination  for  training  in  health  and  nutrition,  as  well  as  micro-enterprise \nmanagement topics. Roughly two-thirds of participants reported an increase in income \nover the study period, and their net incomes in 1997 appeared far higher than the control \ngroup (perhaps casting some doubt on the representativeness of the latter). However, on \n\n                                                 \n14 To explain this worrying result, the authors suggest that as the poverty measure is expenditure based, \nnew borrowers may curtail their consumption in the short-term to invest in their micro-enterprise at the \nsame time as they take out a new loan, and that this lower consumption may show up as higher poverty in \nthe short-term.  \n\n 21\n\n\fthe  key  concern  of  the  study,  nutritional  status  (for  example  child  height-for-age  or \nweight-for-height measures), there is little evidence of any impact due to the program. \nThe  most  positive  result  is  that  for  households  suffering  \u2018food  stress\u2019,  participants  are \nless likely to sell off animals and are more likely to take out loans as a coping strategy, \nthan are non-participants. \n\nIn  general,  for  Latin  America  the  available  studies  suggest  that  MFIs,  whilst \nthey may be flourishing in commercial terms, and providing a valuable service to micro-\nenterprises often run by poor entrepreneurs, have relatively weak impact on those at the \nvery bottom of the income distribution. \n\n4.  Forms of Micro Credit Interventions and Cost-Effectiveness \n\nIt is clear that experimentation and local variation are likely to be important aspects of \nsuccessful  MFIs.  A  few  studies  (more  in  Asia  than  in  Latin  America)  have  looked  in \ndetail at the impact and cost effectiveness of different forms of intervention. The Hulme \nand Mosley (1996) cross-country study of 13 institutions in seven countries (Bolivia in \nLatin America and Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka and Indonesia in Asia) found that loan \nimpact,  in  terms  of  change  in  borrower  income,  (which  is  not  necessary  the  same  as \npoverty impact) was greater in the more financially viable institutions (such as BRI and \nBancoSol). They explain this in terms of the screening efficiency of higher interest rates \nand  tighter  repayment  conditions,  which  deter  less  financially  sound  borrowers.  The \ninstitutions  involved  used  a  range  of  delivery  mechanisms,  and  the  analysis  does  not \nallow  firm  judgments  between  these.  Within-country  comparisons  by  ownership  are \nmade explicitly in Park and Ren (2001), who look at the Chinese experience drawing on \nhousehold survey data for 1997. They are able to compare three types of program based \non  ownership  characteristics\u2014NGO-based,  mixed  programs  and  government \nownership. Whether in terms of conventional financial criteria like repayment rates, or \nmeasures  of  initial  impact  like  targeting  effectiveness,  the  NGO  programs  appear  to \nfunction best, with the government-run programs being the least successful. \n\nDetailed mechanisms for micro lending are examined for Thailand by Kaboski \nand  Townsend  (2003),  who  look  at  different  institutional  variants  such  as  production \ncredit  groups,  women\u2019s  groups,  rice  banks  and  buffalo  banks,  as  well  as  a  variety  of \nservices  including  training  and  various  savings  facilities.  Of  the  forms  of  institution, \nallowing  for  a  range  of  other  factors,  women\u2019s  groups  appear  to  have  the  largest \npositive impact on their members. Of the services offered, training in conjunction with \ncredit  appears  to  work  well  and  the  availability  of  savings  facilities  appears  to  be \nassociated  with  asset  growth  amongst  households.  Of  the  savings  services,  regular \n\u2018pledged savings\u2019 have the largest positive impact. Explanations offered for this include \nthe use of savings as collateral for further loans either from the institution itself or from \nother  sources,  and  a  reduction  in  the  cost  and  risk  of  infrequent  deposits  and \nwithdrawals.  However  since  the  poorest  may  not  be  in  a  position  to  offer  regular \nsavings, this also provides an explanation for why they may benefit relatively little from \nMFIs.15  \n\n                                                 \n15 Fujita (2000) makes this point in the context of Bangladesh. \n\n 22\n\n\fMost studies of the impact of different forms of microfinance do not conduct a \nfull  cost  effectiveness  analysis  in  order  to  judge  both  the  effectiveness  of  different \nalternatives and how microfinance interventions compare in efficiency terms with other \nways of reaching the poor. However there is often a general expectation that MFIs are \nan  effective  and  efficient  means  of  reaching  the  poor.  For  example,  Wright  (2000) \nargues  that  \u201c...microfinance  has  a  particular  advantage  over  almost  (and  probably)  all \nother interventions\u201d in providing cost-effective and sustainable services to the poor. In \nfact,  the  evidence  to  support  such  a  strong  claim  is  not  yet  available.  Bangladesh  and \nBolivia,  the  most  widely  studied  countries  for  microfinance,  provide  most  of  the \nevidence on its cost effectiveness. \n\nThe early work by Khandker (1998) attempts to assess the cost-effectiveness of \nmicro  credit  in  Bangladesh  (that  is  costs  per  taka  of  consumption  for  the  poor)  as \ninstitutions  and  other  poverty-targeted \ncompared  with  more  formal  financial \ninterventions.  His  data  are  summarized  in  table  5.  They  appear  to  be  based  on  the \nassumption of  a zero leakage rate to the non-poor. The interesting result that emerges is \nthat  the  Grameen  Bank  is  considerably  more  cost-effective  than  BRAC  and  that  as \nexpected, loans to female borrowers are considerably more cost-effective than loans to \nmales.  Further,  subsidies  to  Grameen  (but  not  to  BRAC)  appear  to  be  a  more  cost \neffective means of reaching the poor than various food-for-work programs. However a \nfood-for-education  scheme  appears  very  cost-effective  relative  to  the  food-for-work \nprograms  and  to  BRAC. 16   Formal  financial  institutions  are  less  cost-effective  than \nGrameen  for  both  female  and  male  borrowers,  and  less  cost  effective  than  BRAC  in \nsome,  both  not  all,  cases  examined  (Khandker  1998:134-139).  The  high  figure  for \nBRAC  is  in  part  due  to  the  range  of  services,  such  as  training,  offered  in  addition  to \nmicro credit, but nonetheless if such services are essential to the success of micro credit, \nit is legitimate to include their cost in a cost-benefit assessment of micro credit.  \n\n \n \n\n                                                 \n16 The  study  on  this  scheme  by  Wodon  (1998)  appears  considerably  more  sophisticated  than  the  other \nstudies and compares costs with the future stream of estimated benefits to the poor in terms of gains from \neducation. The ratio for this activity may not be directly comparable with the other figures in the table. \n\n 23\n\n\fTable 5.

The  figures  for  Grameen \nsupport  this  view,  whilst  those  for  BRAC  do  not.  More  recently  a  couple  of  other \nestimates  are  available.  Burgess  and  Pande  (2003)  examine  whether  the  pattern  of \ncommercial  bank  expansion  in  India  into  rural  areas,  previously  not  served  by  banks \n(so-called \u2018social banking\u2019), has had an impact on rural poverty, and their work allows a \nsimple comparison with microfinance. Their estimates suggest that it costs 2.72 rupees \nto  generate  an  additional  rupee  of  income  for  the  poor  via  social  banking  program. \nCompared with the data in Table 5, this ratio is higher than the cost-effectiveness ratio \nfor Grameen, but lower than that for BRAC.17  \n\nA further look at the effectiveness of Grameen is provided by Schreiner (2003), \nwho  calculates  the  subsidy-lending  ratio  at  0.22  over  the  period  1983-97.  This  is  not \ndirectly equivalent to the ratios in Table 5, but assuming the same return to borrowing \nas in Khandker (1998) these figures can be converted into a broadly equivalent ratio of \ncost to gains to the poor of 1.15. This is consistent with the figures in Table 5, which \nwould  need  to  be  averaged  to  give  an  overall  return  to  male  and  female  borrowing \n                                                 \n17 It should be noted that the benefits from Grameen lending found in Khandker (2003), which are almost \nhalf  of  those  found  in  his  earlier  study,  imply  considerably  higher  cost  effectiveness  ratios  than  those \nreported in Table 5, unless there has been a corresponding rise in the efficiency of operations. \n\n 24\n\n\fcombined.  The  result  confirms  Grameen  as  a  relatively  cost-effective  form  of  poverty \nintervention,  although  it  says  nothing  about  how  the  benefits  from  its  activities  are \ndistributed between the poor, the very poor and those above the poverty line. \n\nFor Latin America, Mosley (2001) provides a rare, if approximate, estimate of \ncost-effectiveness  of  MFIs  relative  to  other  poverty  interventions  in  Bolivia.  He \ncompares  the  estimated  numbers  in  a  particular  area  brought  over  the  poverty  line  by \nfour  different  MFIs,  as  a  result  of  micro  credit,  to  the  organizations\u2019  expenditure  that \ncan  be  allocated  to  activities  in  that  area.  This  gives  a  cost  per  person  brought  out  of \npoverty  for  four  MFIs  that  use  different  approaches.  BancoSol  and  Fundacion  para  la \nPromocion  y  Desarollo  de  la  Microempresa  (PRODEM)  are  more  commercial  with \ngreater  use  of  individual  loans,  whilst  ProMujer  lends  largely  to  women  in  urban  co-\noperative groups, and Sartawi offers both group and individual loans, but also provides \na range of training and education services in addition to credit. The cost-effectiveness in \nthe MFIs, defined as the cost per person brought out of poverty, is $603 for BancoSol, \n$467  for  ProMujer,  $373  for  PRODEM  and  $589  for  Sartawi.  These  figures  are  not \ndirectly comparable with those for Bangladesh reported in Table 5, as the latter are the \nratio of MFI costs to benefit in income (or consumption) received by the poor. Although \nthe range is relatively wide, perhaps due to the approximate nature of the calculations, \nthe  author  himself  suggests  that  they  show  that  there  is  little  difference  between  the \ninstitutions  and  that  no  single  model  dominates  micro  credit  delivery  in  Bolivia  (or \nindeed elsewhere). Some approximate comparisons have also been made with the cost \nof poverty reduction from Social Fund investment in health, education and rural roads, \nwhich show microfinance from all of the institutions to be lower in cost than the Social \nFund programs.18 However, the cost effectiveness figures found for MFIs in Bolivia in \ndollars per person brought out of poverty are much higher than some of the anecdotal \nfigures  used  for  Bangladesh.  The  fact  that  these  estimates,  approximate  as  they  are, \nprovide one of the few indications of the cost-effectiveness of MFIs in Latin America, is \nan indication of the undeveloped nature of research on this issue in the region. \n\nIn general, in terms of cost-effectiveness, there is limited support for the view \nthat MFIs can be a cost-effective way of reaching the poor, although the range of figures \nwithin both Bangladesh and Bolivia suggest that this is far from inevitable for all types \nof MFI. BRAC in particular appears relatively high cost. However, even if it could be \nshown  that  microfinance  uniformly  outperformed  other  targeting  measures  in  cost \neffectiveness  terms,  one  could  still  not  conclude  that  other  measures  should  be \nabandoned  and  their  funds  diverted  to  microfinance.  As  Khandker  (1998)  points  out, \nparticipants  in  microfinance  borrowing  self-select  (that  is  they  judge  that  micro  credit \nsuits their particular needs, often for self employed work), whilst microfinance may not \nbe suitable for others amongst the poor.  For this latter group, perhaps more risk adverse \nor more disadvantaged, other forms of targeting will still be required.  \n\n                                                 \n18 As defined in Table 5 of Mosley (2001), the indicators for the MFIs and the Social Fund programs are \nnot directly comparable as the former are cost per person brought out of poverty and the latter are cost per \nincome benefit received by the poor.  Additional assumptions would have be used to convert the ratios for \nthe Social Fund programs to cost per person brought out of poverty, but these are not referred to. \n\n 25\n\n\f5.  Conclusions \n\nDespite  the  current  enthusiasm  in  the  donor  community  for  microfinance  programs, \nrigorous  research  on  the  outreach,  impact  and  cost-effectiveness  of  such  programs  is \nrare.  Design of aid programs would ideally incorporate evidence on all three points, but \nthe  research  that  does  exist  generally  focuses  on  only  one  of  these  criteria:  either \noutreach, impact or cost-effectiveness.  In part, this reflects the difficulty of establishing \nan  appropriate  statistical  methodology  and  implementing  those  standards  in  practice, \nand  in  part  no  doubt  reflects  the  variations  found  in  practice  in  the  way  in  which \nmicrofinance operates.  The evidence surveyed here suggests that the conclusion from \nthe early literature, that microfinance may have had positive impacts on poverty but is \nunlikely  to  be  a  simple  panacea  for  reaching  the  core  poor,  remains  broadly  valid.  \nReaching the core poor is difficult, and some of the reasons that made them difficult to \nreach with conventional financial instruments mean that they may also be high risk and \ntherefore unattractive microfinance clients. \n\nAsia  has  much  to  learn  from  Latin  America  in  terms  of  developing  a  vibrant \ncommercially  oriented  MFI  sector.  However  MFIs  in  Latin  America  have  often  been \nseen as a vehicle for the development of the micro-enterprise sector rather than as a tool \nfor the removal of core poverty, which was its initial focus in much of Asia. Work on \nBolivia  has  demonstrated  this  at  least  for  that  country.  There  has  been  an  extensive \ndebate that we do not touch on here, on the financial sustainability of MFIs. We would \nsimply  make  the  point  that  just  because  an  institution  requires  a  subsidy  to  cover  its \ncosts in itself is not a reason for not supporting the institution. The issue should be what \nbenefits, in terms of income gains for the poor, can be achieved with the subsidy and \nhow the ratio of subsidy to benefits compares with that for other interventions. Detailed \ncost effectiveness studies are rare and those that are available show both high and low \nscores  for  MFIs  in  the  same  country.  Hence  there  is  a  need  to  continually  improve \ndesign and outreach and to see MFIs as part of the package for targeting the poor, rather \nthan the whole solution.  \n\nOur  view  is  that  despite  the  difficulties,  there  is  a  need  for  more  careful \nresearch  on  the  outreach,  impact  and  cost-effectiveness  of  microfinance  programs\u2014\nstudies that rigorously address the critical issues of selection and placement bias.  Such \nstudies  can  inform  the  debate  on  microfinance  by  sharpening  the  donor  community\u2019s \nunderstanding  of  the  role  of  microfinance  in  reaching  the  poor,  its  impact  in  different \nenvironments, and its cost-effectiveness as a poverty intervention.   \n\n 26\n\n\fBibliography \n\n \nAmin  S.,  Rai  A.S.  and  Ropa  G.
