INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nBown and McCulloch \n\nJapan in the 1950s through the 1990s and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) since the \nlate  1970s  have  followed  similar\u2014and  similarly  successful\u2014strategies  of  promoting \neconomic growth through rapid acquisition of advanced foreign technology and expansion of \nmanufactured exports. While other Asian countries have done likewise, in some cases with \nexports  growing  as  rapidly  and  for  as  long,  Japan  and  the  PRC  have  presented  special \nchallenges  to  the  General  Agreement  on  Trade  and  Tariffs  and  the  World  Trade \nOrganization (GATT/WTO) trading system because their shares of world exports have been \nso  large  and  the  associated  bilateral  trade  imbalances  with  the  United  States  (US)  so \nconspicuous.  In  both  political  and  economic  terms,  these  large  imbalances  seem  to \ncontradict the GATT/WTO principle of reciprocity, which involves a balance of market-access \nconcessions across major players in the system. \n\nDuring their respective periods of rapid export growth, both Japan and the PRC accounted \nfor a major share of total world exports. As of 2007, the PRC\u2019s share of world merchandise \nexports had soared to 8.9%, less than Germany\u2019s 9.7% share but topping the US share of \n8.5% as well as Japan\u2019s 5.2%, in each of the latter three cases from a much larger economy \n(WTO 2008a). Given the sharp drop in global import demand following the 2008 onset of the \nglobal  financial  crisis,  the  PRC  may  not  surpass  Japan\u2019s  1980s  peak  of  around  10%. \nHowever,  US  imports  from  the  PRC  in  2008  (US$337.8  billion)  still  exceeded  their  level  in \n2007 (US$321.5 billion); the 2008 bilateral trade imbalance (US$266.3 billion) also exceeded \n2007\u2019s record figure, although only by US$10 billion (Morrison 2009; Table1).1 \n\nUnlike  the  principles  of  most  favored  nation  treatment  (Article  I)  and  national  treatment \n(Article III), there is no \u201cArticle\u201d of the GATT 1947 clearly identifying reciprocity as a GATT \nprinciple.  However,  the  Articles  that  govern  how  countries  renegotiate  concessions\u2014in \nparticular  Articles  XXVIII  and  XIX\u2014do  contain  explicit  language  about  reciprocity,  and  the \nGATT/WTO  practice  of  reciprocity  has  typically  resulted  in  a  balance  of  market-opening \nconcessions  across  the  major  players  in  the  system.2 But  when  large  economies  such  as \nJapan and the PRC pursue an export-led growth strategy, the resulting increase in exports \ndisturbs  the  initial  \u201cbalance  of  concessions\u201d  (i.e.,  the  reciprocal  market-access  outcome). \nThe major trading partners that receive the increased exports then seek ways to rebalance \nthe bargain.3 \n\nThis paper examines the policy responses of the US to the export-led growth strategies of \nJapan  and  the  PRC  and  the  associated  bilateral  imbalances.  We  begin  in  Section  2  by \nconsidering  some  relevant  features  of  the  two  episodes,  identifying  similarities  and \ndifferences. We then examine how the US has responded to bilateral imbalances with Japan \nand the PRC, treating not only the \u201csymptoms\u201d (rapid import growth from the relevant partner \nand slow export growth to that partner), but also the underlying causes of the imbalances as \nperceived by US officials. In the face of a large bilateral trade deficit, the US has used trade \npolicy to treat the symptoms directly (i.e., to slow the partner\u2019s export expansion into the US \nmarket  and  to  speed  up  US  exporters\u2019  expansion  into  the  partner\u2019s  market).  Section  3 \ncompares US policy measures intended to slow Japan\u2019s expanding exports to the US in the \n1970s\u20131990s  and  the  PRC\u2019s  expanding  exports  since  the  1990s.  Section  4  describes  US \nefforts during the same periods to promote US export expansion into the import markets of \nJapan and the PRC. Sections 3 and 4 also show how US efforts to treat the symptoms may \n\n                                                 \n1These data refer to trade in goods only. Bilateral trade in both directions dropped sharply in early 2009 relative \n\nto the corresponding period in 2008. \n\n2Economic  analyses  such  as  Bagwell  and  Staiger  (1999,  2002)  treated  the  GATT/WTO  as  a  self-enforcing \nagreement and focus on outcomes sustained through each member\u2019s recognition that any country can seek to \namend the initial bargain. \n\n3The  increased  incentive  to  defect  from  the  initial  bargain  can  result  from  economic  forces  that  are  completely \ndistinct from any political incentive to raise tariffs (e.g., to assist a preferred domestic industry or to redistribute \nincome). Broda, Lim\u00e3o, and Weinstein (2008) provided recent empirical evidence that importers\u2019 market power \ndoes influence their trade policies. \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 158 \n \n\n \n\nBown and McCulloch \n\nhave influenced the evolution of the rules of the international trading system under the GATT \nand WTO Agreements. \n\nThe second half of the paper examines underlying causes of the bilateral trade imbalances \nas perceived by US officials and the public, US policy approaches implemented with respect \nto Japan and the PRC to address some of these causes, and the resulting implications for \nthe rules of the trading system. In Section 5, we examine the bilateral trade imbalances at \nthe industry level; we focus on US policies based on the premise that such imbalances are \ndue to a competitive advantage unfairly created by foreign (Japanese or PRC) policies (e.g., \nindustrial  policy,  explicit  and  implicit  government  subsidies,  and  currency  manipulation).  In \nSection  6,  we  examine  the  bilateral  trade  imbalances  from  a  broader  macroeconomic \nperspective.  This  perspective  helps  to  explain  the  end  of  the  US-Japanese  bilateral \nimbalance  episode  in  the  1990s,  and  may  also  speak  to  the  resolution  of  the  US-PRC \nbilateral imbalance. Section 7 concludes the paper. \n\nOur purpose in the paper is to describe actions taken by the US and interpret them in terms \nof the role played by reciprocity in theories of the GATT/WTO as a self-enforcing agreement. \nThe  paper  is  thus  intended  to  be  descriptive  and  analytical,  not  normative.  While  we \ncharacterize certain US policies as \u201ctargeting\u201d Japanese or PRC exports, we do not attempt \na  systematic  evaluation  either  of  the  effectiveness  of  these  policies  in  achieving  their \nobjectives or their consistency with national laws and international agreements. Likewise, we \ndo not attempt a systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of Japanese and PRC industrial \nand  macroeconomic  policies  in  promoting  economic  growth  or  their  conformity  with \ninternational agreements. \n\n2.  US-JAPAN AND US-PRC: SIMILARITIES AND \n\nDIFFERENCES IN THE TWO EPISODES \n\nThere  are  striking  parallels  and  also  important  differences  between  the  US-Japan  frictions \nthat peaked in the mid-1980s and the more recent US-PRC frictions that began in the late \n1990s. The most salient common element is the huge size of the bilateral trade imbalances. \nTo many, the imbalances themselves are convincing evidence of unfair trading practices.4 In \nboth  cases,  a  large  bilateral  trade  deficit  has  been  linked  in  the  public  mind  to  the  steady \ndecline  in  the  share  of  manufacturing  in  total  US  employment.  Also  similar  are  the \nallegations  that  the  extraordinary  export  growth  has  been  sustained  by  factors  such  as \ngovernment  subsidies  and  persistent  currency  undervaluation,  rather  than\u2014or  at  least  in \naddition  to\u2014comparative  advantage.  Both  countries  prevented  currency  appreciation, \nespecially relative to the US dollar, through accumulation of dollar-denominated government \nsecurities.5 Both  countries  also  channeled  capital  to  preferred  sectors  through  the  banking \nsystem,  in  both  cases  eventually  resulting  in  an  overhang  of  bad  loans  that  complicated \nthese \nefforts \ncomparisons. \n\nimprove  capital-market  efficiency. 6  Table  1  summarizes  many  of \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n4Although  the  link  has  wide  acceptance  among  US  policy  makers  and  the  public,  economic  analysis  indicates \nthat  bilateral  imbalances  have  no  particular  significance  in  a  multi-country  world.  Free  trade  based  on \ncomparative  advantage  would  be  expected  to  produce  trade  surpluses  with  some  partners  and  trade  deficits \nwith  others.  Moreover,  as  we  discuss  in  Section  6,  an  overall  external  imbalance  cannot  exist  without  a \ncorresponding imbalance between domestic saving and domestic investment spending. \n\n5On  the  use  of  currency  undervaluation  to  protect  the  entire  tradables  sector,  see  Corden  (1981),  Freund  and \n\nPierola (2008), Rodrik (2008), and Staiger and Sykes (2008). \n\n6According  to  Saxonhouse  (1983),  Japan\u2019s  industrial  policy  in  the  1970s  should  be  viewed  as  a  means  to \novercome  distortions  resulting  from  the  country\u2019s  poorly  functioning  capital  market.  The  PRC  uses  industrial \npolicy tools including taxation, indicative lending, and input pricing to provide firms with incentives intended to \nachieve desired modifications in the composition of economic activity (Bergsten et al. 2008; USITC 2007). The \nPRC  categorizes  its  industries  as  \u201cencouraged,\u201d  \u201crestricted,\u201d  or  \u201cto  be  eliminated,\u201d  with  these  classifications \nsubject to frequent revision, and structures incentives accordingly. Although an ongoing goal of PRC industrial \npolicy  is  to  facilitate  movement  from  a  planned  to  a  market  economy,  firms  owned  entirely  or  in  part  by \ngovernment units continue to play a major role in the economy. \n\n2 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 158 \n \n\n \n\nBown and McCulloch \n\nTable 1: Points of Comparison: Japan (1970s\u20131980s) and the PRC (1990s\u20132000s) \n\nSimilarities \nHigh saving rate \nExport-oriented growth strategy \nLarge domestic market \nLarge bilateral trade surplus with US \nLarge share of world exports \nAllegations of unfair trade and dumping \nIndustrial policy, subsidies to preferred industries \nExport concentration by industry \nExchange rate undervaluation \nLarge official and private holdings of US government securities \nHost-country scrutiny of outward FDI \nLack of transparency \n \nDifferences \nPer capita income (about US$3,000 for PRC in 2007; a substantial fraction of population \nliving below US$2 per day) \nMajor role of agricultural reforms (PRC) \nOpenness to manufactured imports (PRC) \nSpecial Economic Zones (PRC) \nLarge global trade surplus (Japan) \nKey role of inward foreign direct investment (PRC) \nMode of technology transfer  \nEnforcement of intellectual property rights \nParticipation in vertical specialization  \nCentralization of industrial policy (Japan) \nIndustrial organization (Japan\u2019s keiretsu) \nDirect competition with US exports (Japan) \nRole in US security (Japan)  \n\nFDI = foreign direct investment, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, US = United States. \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 research. \n\nOne last and very significant common element in the two episodes is the response from the \nUS as well as other affected importing nations: the persistent use of discriminatory strategies \nto delay adjustment to growth of competing imports from the new sources. These strategies \nviolate  the  spirit  (as  well  as,  occasionally,  the  letter  of  the  GATT/WTO)  principle  of  most \nfavored  nation  (MFN)  treatment  (i.e.,  nondiscrimination  among  trading  partners).  The \nimmediate  result  has  been  to  protect  established  import  suppliers  as  well  as  domestic \nproducers  from  the  full  effects  of  surging  imports  from  the  new  sources.  The  longer-term \nresult has been to promote growth of imports from still newer sources. Protection targeted at \nJapan promoted export growth first in textiles and later in steel and semiconductors from the \n\u201cnewly  industrializing  economies\u201d  (Hong  Kong,  China;  Singapore;  Republic  of  Korea;  and \nTaipei,China). Recent US and EU actions in textiles and apparel targeted at the PRC have \nbenefited  Viet  Nam,  India,  and  Bangladesh,  along  with  US  partners  in  various  preferential \ntrade agreements. The US also initiated bilateral negotiations with Japan and later the PRC \nto  increase  their  purchases  of  US  exports.  We  provide  more  details  on  US  trade  policies \ntoward Japan and the PRC in Sections 3 and 4. \n\nIn addition, the US has sought to limit foreign acquisitions of US companies by both nations \n(as well as others) on \u201cnational security\u201d grounds. The Committee on Foreign Investment in \nthe United States was established in 1975 for the purpose of monitoring the effects of inward \nforeign direct investment (FDI). In 1988, the US Congress gave the President the power to \n\n3 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 158 \n \n\n \n\nBown and McCulloch \n\nblock a foreign takeover based on advice from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the \nUnited  States  (CFIUS)  indicating  a  threat  to  national  security.  For  example,  US  authorities \nprevented  the  acquisition  of  Fairchild  Semiconductor  by  Japan\u2019s  Fujitsu  in  1987  and  of \nUnocal,  an  oil  producer,  by  the  Chinese  National  Offshore  Oil  Corporation  (CNOOC)  in \n2005. In contrast, greenfield investments, notably foreign-owned auto assembly plants, have \nbeen assiduously courted. \n\nAlong with these striking similarities, there are also fundamental differences between the two \ncases. Most important, Japan was already an established industrial nation in the 1980s. By \nthe  mid-1980s,  Japan\u2019s  per  capita  income  was  above  that  of  most  European  nations; \nenrollment  rates  for  secondary  and  higher  education  were  likewise  comparable  to  those  of \nthe richest nations (World Bank 1986). In contrast, the PRC is still poor, at least in terms of \nper capita income (around US$3,000 in 2007), despite a prolonged period of stellar growth \nperformance. Thus, it is not surprising that earlier trade frictions between Japan and the US \nfocused mainly on direct competition (i.e., Japan\u2019s increasing share of the US market and its \ndisplacement of US exports in third-country markets). Moreover, as a wealthy country, Japan \nconsumed many of the same types of goods and services produced by the US, but imported \ntoo few of those from the US\u2014at least in the view of US producers and policy makers.  \n\nGiven the PRC\u2019s much lower per capita income, only a small fraction of PRC consumers can \nyet  afford  the  products  that  represent  US  comparative  advantage  (i.e.,  those  supplied  by \nintellectual  property-intensive  industries  [films,  music,  software,  pharmaceuticals]),  when \nsold at prices that reflect full enforcement of US intellectual property rights. Moreover, PRC \nconsumers\u2019 desire to acquire such goods at affordable prices feeds the demand for pirated \nand copycat goods produced locally, thereby adding to US complaints regarding the PRC\u2019s \nlax enforcement of intellectual property rights, but this consumption pattern also implies that \nthe  PRC\u2019s  continued  growth  may  help  to  increase  even  further  the  country\u2019s  already  large \nimports  from  the  US.  As  of  2008,  the  PRC  was  already  the  third  largest  market  for  US \nmerchandise  exports,  although  a  large  share  of  those  exports  consisted  of  agricultural \nproducts and raw materials. \n\nAs a reflection of the large differences in relative factor abundance and productivity between \nthe US and the PRC, direct competition with the PRC has been an important issue for only a \nfew  US  industries,  mainly  for  labor-intensive  \u201csunset\u201d  industries  like  apparel.  Rather,  the \nPRC has displaced other established trading partners in supplying the US market. As Figure \n1 illustrates, the PRC\u2019s share of the total US trade deficit has largely replaced the share of \nother East Asian countries over the period from 1989 through 2007.7 In 1989, US trade with \nthe PRC (including Hong Kong, China), accounted for less than 9% of total trade, with Japan \naccounting  for  about  45%,  and  other  East  Asian  countries  accounting  for  about  26%.  By \n2008, the PRC\u2019s share had soared to more than 31%, while those of Japan and the rest of \nEast  Asia  had  fallen  to  around  9%  each.  These  shifts  reflect  the  growth  of  the  PRC\u2019s \n\u201cprocessing  trade\u201d  in  which  PRC  subsidiaries  of  Japanese  manufacturing  firms  import \nintermediate inputs from Japan and export final goods to the US. Similar supply chains link \nthe PRC to other more advanced neighbors in East Asia, such as the Republic of Korea and \nTaipei,China (Dean, Lovely, and Mora forthcoming; Van Assche, Hong, and Ma forthcoming; \nGreaney and Li forthcoming). \n\nIncreased competition from the PRC has stimulated interest on the part of other nations in \nnegotiating  preferential  trade  agreements  with  the  US  as  a  means  of  getting  better-than-\nMFN access to the lucrative US market (Bown and McCulloch 2007). However, the nature of \ncompetition  from  the  PRC  has  been  shifting  rapidly.  US  officials  have  signaled  their \ndispleasure that the PRC is encouraging development in high-technology sectors, including \nsome  sectors  that  will  offer  direct  competition  comparable  to  that  in  the  earlier  US-Japan \nepisode. \n\n                                                 \n7We follow common practice in expressing national and regional bilateral imbalances as shares or fractions of the \noverall  US  imbalance.  Note,  however,  that  some  US  bilateral  balances  are  positive.  Moreover,  this \npresentation may suggest that movements in individual bilateral balances are determined independently, while \nin fact they can be linked causally. In particular, the reduction over time in the shares of Japan and other East \nAsian countries reflects relocation via direct foreign investment of processing activities to the PRC. \n\n4 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 158 \n \n\n \n\nBown and McCulloch \n\nFigure 1: Share of Total US Trade Deficit, 1989\u20132007:  \nThe PRC, Japan, and the Rest of East Asia \n\nShare of \nTotal US\nTrade Deficit\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\nPRC (+ Hong\nKong, China)\n\nJapan\n\nRest of East\nAsia\n\n \n\n0\n\n1989 \n\n1992\n\n1995 \n\n1998\n\n2001\n\n2004\n\n2007 \n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, US = United States. \n\nNote: Bilateral trade deficit defined from series US General Imports-US Total Exports.  \n\nSource: Constructed by the authors from USITC DataWeb (available http://dataweb.usitc.gov/). \n\nIn  terms  of  overall  trade  patterns,  there  are  similarities  as  well  as  differences.  Like  Japan, \nthe  PRC  is  a  major  importer  of  raw  materials,  and  these  imports  have  grown  at  a  pace \nsimilar to that of its exports. However, the PRC is far more open to manufactured imports, \nboth  of  final  goods  and  intermediate  inputs,  the  latter  an  indication  of  the  PRC\u2019s  much \ngreater  involvement  in  international  vertical  specialization.  The  PRC\u2019S  trade  to  GDP  ratio \n(2005\u20132007)  was  71.3%,  an  astonishing  figure  given  the  PRC\u2019s  size  and  level  of \ndevelopment.  In  contrast,  the  corresponding  ratio  for  the  US  was  27.2%  and  for  Japan \n31.5% (WTO 2008b).8 Another significant difference is the role played by FDI. The first of the \nPRC\u2019s  export-oriented  special  economic  zones,  which  opened  in  1980,  encouraged  FDI \nthrough  preferential  treatment  of  foreign  investors.  One  result  may  have  been  \u201cround-\ntripping\u201d  of  mainland  capital\u2014mainland  investors  routing  funds  through  Hong  Kong,  China \nfirms in order to qualify for the preferential treatment reserved for FDI. By 2004, the PRC\u2019s \nstock of inward FDI stood at US$702 billion, with an FDI to gross domestic product (GDP) \nratio of 0.42, compared with Japan\u2019s 1986 stock of US$7 billion, a negligible share of GDP. \nIndeed,  even  by  2004,  Japan\u2019s  FDI  stock  was  still  only  US$97  billion,  and  its  FDI  to  GDP \nratio  was  just  0.02  (Hufbauer,  Wong,  and  Sheth  2006). 9 While  Japan  and  the  PRC  both \nachieved  rapid  productivity  improvement  through  adaptation  of  advanced  technologies \ndeveloped  in  richer  countries,  Japan  acquired  technology  mainly  through  licensing \nagreements, while for the PRC, FDI has been a major channel for technology transfer. \n\n                                                 \n8Data for the PRC do not include Hong Kong, China, with a ratio of 397%, nearly half of which represents exports \n\nto the mainland. \n\n9Data  for  the  PRC  include  inward  FDI  from  Hong  Kong,  China,  of  which  some  portion  is  due  to  round-tripping \nfrom the mainland. With Hong Kong, China considered separately from the PRC, in 2008 Hong Kong, China \nranked #3  worldwide in terms of FDI stock, after  the US and the United Kingdom,  while the PRC ranked #6, \nafter France and Germany. Japan was #24 (US Central Intelligence Agency 2009). \n\n5 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 158 \n \n\n \n\nBown and McCulloch \n\nAlthough  industrial  policy  has  played  an  important  role  in  both  Japan  and  the  PRC,  the \ndominant role of Japan\u2019s Ministry of International Trade and Industry and Ministry of Finance \nin  the  1970s  and  1980s  has  no  close  parallel  in  the  PRC  of  today.  Instead,  much  of  the \nPRC\u2019s  economic  policy-making  has  been  decentralized,  with  the  direction  of  industrial \ndevelopment  the  result  of  input  at  many  levels,  from  the  national  to  the  \u201cvillage\u201d  (Perkins \n2001; Bergsten et al. 2008; USITC 2007).10 In this respect the PRC more closely resembles \nthe US or the European Union, where individual sub-national units enjoy considerable scope \nfor  setting  priorities  and  implementing  policies.  Finally,  although  moving  from  a  planned \ntoward  a  market  economy,  the  PRC  remains  a  communist  state  and  has  not  made \nsignificant steps toward a democratic system of government at the national level. However, \nelections  are  routine  at  the  village  level  and  sometimes  even  mandatory.  Japan\u2019s  national \ngovernment  is  an  elected  parliament,  and  economic  policy  making  remains  relatively \ncentralized. \n\nThese political and economic differences have direct implications for the resolution of trade \ndisputes, whether through bilateral negotiations or through actions taken in the GATT/WTO \nsystem. Officials of the PRC\u2019s national government may enjoy more freedom of action than \ntheir Japanese counterparts since the government does not need to satisfy a representative \nelectorate.  However,  PRC  officials  believe  that  the  country\u2019s  political  stability  is  highly \ndependent on continued economic growth. PRC policy makers were therefore aggressive in \nstimulating domestic demand as a means to offset the effects of the sharp drop in exports \nthat the PRC experienced in early 2009. \n\nThe  trade  policy  options  available  to  the  US  and  other  trading  partners  in  dealing  with  the \nPRC may be more circumscribed than in the case of Japan because of the PRC\u2019s extensive \nlinks to these economies via FDI and vertical specialization.11 In the WTO, enforcement of a \nsuccessful  complaint  is  accomplished  entirely  through  limited  authorized  retaliation,  or  at \nleast  the  threat  of  retaliation.  Given  the  important  role  of  FDI  and  vertical  specialization  in \nmost  of  the  PRC\u2019s  export  sectors,  finding  suitable  targets  for  authorized  retaliation  may \nprove difficult.12 Nonetheless, the US has moved since 2006 toward greater reliance on the \nWTO in handling its trade conflicts with the PRC. \n\n3.  TREATING THE SYMPTOMS (1): US EFFORTS TO LIMIT \nEXPANSION OF FOREIGN EXPORTS INTO THE US \nMARKET \n\nIn the face of major bilateral trade imbalances with Japan beginning in the 1970s and with \nthe  PRC  beginning  in  the  1990s,  the  US  implemented  policies  intended  to  slow  export \nexpansion of these countries into the US market. In this section, we compare US attempts to \nslow  imports  from  Japan  and  from  the  PRC,  examining  in  turn  voluntary  export  restraints, \nantidumping  (AD),  countervailing  duties,  safeguards,  and  formation  of  preferential  trading \narrangements with other sources of US imports. \n\n3.1  Voluntary Export Restraints (VERs) \n\n3.1.1  Japan: VER Proliferation across Industries, 1960s\u20131990s \n\nJapan was admitted to the GATT in 1955 with strong support from the US. Fourteen other \nGATT contracting parties, fearing import competition based on low Japanese wages, initially \nlimited their liberalization commitments by invoking Article XXXV. However, problems soon \narose in the US-Japan relationship over Japanese textile exports. By 1957, the first orderly \n                                                 \n10Bergsten  et  al.  also  note  efforts  in  the  early  to  mid-1990s  to  recentralize,  particularly  in  the  area  of  tax \n\ncollection. \n\n11On the other hand, security concerns may have shaped US policies toward Japan until 1975, given US reliance \n\non Japanese bases during the Vietnam War. \n12See, for example, the discussion in Bown (2009b). \n\n6 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 158 \n \n\n \n\nBown and McCulloch \n\nmarketing  agreements  between  the  US  and  Japan  had  been  signed.13 These  agreements \nrepresented  a  US  decision  to  forego  GATT-sanctioned  remedies  in  favor  of  a  non-MFN, \nbilateral  approach  to  handling  trade  frictions  and  set  a  pattern  replicated  for  additional \nproducts  and  importing  and  exporting  countries  in  subsequent  decades  in  the  form  of \nnegotiated  \u201cvoluntary\u201d  export  restraints.  The  market  incentives  created  by  the  initial \ndiscriminatory form of protection eventually produced the worldwide Multi-Fiber Arrangement \n(MFA)  in  1974.  The  MFA  placed  bilateral  quantitative  limits  on  textile  and  apparel  trade \nbetween  most  pairs  of  importing  and  exporting  countries  until  it  was  phased  out  as  part  of \nthe package negotiated in the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations concluded in 1994. \n\nIn  part  due  to  the  \u201csuccess\u201d  of  agreements  on  textiles  (which  promoted  growth  of  exports \nfrom  other,  not  yet  restricted,  countries  in  Asia  and  elsewhere)  and  as  Japan  made  a  full \nrecovery  from  the  effects  of  World  War  II,  Japan\u2019s  exports  and  US-Japan  trade  frictions \nshifted toward a succession of more sophisticated products. For many products, rapid export \ngrowth resulted first in a US safeguard (Section 201) petition requesting relief from surging \nimports for an injured domestic industry and then a negotiated VER. Table 2 gives examples \nof  US  safeguard  investigations  resulting  in  such  orderly  marketing  agreements  during  the \n1970s and 1980s in Japanese export products such as footwear, steel, television receivers, \nand even autos. \n\nTable 2: Examples of US Safeguard and Antidumping Petitions Resulting in  \nVERs with Japan, 1975\u20131997 \n\n \n\nUS \nLaw  Product \n\n1.

The most important \nof these was the semiconductor VER, negotiated after a pair of AD petitions filed in 1985. A \n1993 petition under the US AD law also resulted in a VER over photo paper between the US \nfirm Kodak and the Japanese firm Fuji. This dispute was a precursor to a high-profile WTO \n\n                                                 \n13The US had already negotiated similar restrictions on Japanese textile exports prior to World War II. \n14During this period, the US also negotiated VERs with Japan and other exporters outside the legal frameworks \n\nof the safeguard and AD laws.  \n\n7 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 158 \n \n\n \n\nBown and McCulloch \n\ndispute  between  Kodak  and  Fuji.  A  1996  AD  petition  over  sodium  azide  resulted  in  a \nnegotiated VER with three Japanese chemical-producing firms. \n\n3.1.2  The PRC: VERs in Textiles and Apparel, 2005\u20132008 \n\nThe  terms  of  the  PRC\u2019s  2001  accession  to  the  WTO  in  2001  granted  WTO  members  a \nnumber  of  the  PRC-specific  transitional  safeguard  mechanisms  designed  to  cope  with  an \nanticipated  increase  in  exports  from  the  PRC,  and  especially  textile  and  apparel  exports \nfollowing  the  scheduled  end  of  the  MFA.  For  the  2001\u20132008  period,  a  US  safeguard \nprogram  covering  only  US  imports  of  textile  and  apparel  products  from  the  PRC  was \nadministered  by  the  Office  of  Textiles  and  Apparel  (OTEXA)  in  the  US  Department  of \nCommerce. \n\nFacing  a  surge  in  imports  of  textile  and  apparel  products  from  the  PRC  following  the \nexpiration of the MFA at the end of 2004, the US negotiated a voluntary export restraint with \nthe  PRC  for  the  2005\u20132008  period  (on  the  economic  effects  of  the  end  of  the  MFA,  see \nBrambilla,  Khandelwal, and  Schott  forthcoming;  Barrows  and  Harrigan 2009).  Although  the \nrules of the WTO preclude the use of VERs, as we describe in more detail below, this policy \ntool  nonetheless  returned  in  the  context  of  one  major  player  seeking  to  slow  the  export \nexpansion of another major trading partner.15 \n\n3.2  US AD against Japan and the PRC \n\nAD  is  a  second  policy  tool  the  US  has  used  to  slow  the  expansion  of  Japanese  and  PRC \nexports into the US market. Japan and the PRC together faced a major share of all US AD \nactivity  over  the  1979\u20132008  period;  25%  of  all  US  AD  investigations  targeted  either \nJapanese  or  PRC  producers,  and  33%  of  all  imposed  US  AD  measures  targeted  either \nJapanese or PRC exports.16 \n\nHowever, as Figure 2 indicates, US use of AD over 1979\u20132008 is actually made up of two \ndistinct  episodes:  the  rise  (1979\u20131988)  and  fall  (1989\u20132008)  of  AD  use  to  manage  the \ngrowth of Japan\u2019s exports to the US, and increased use of AD (since 1989) to manage the \ngrowth of the PRC\u2019s exports to the US. In Figure 2, the bars indicate the number of US AD \nmeasures  imposed  during  various  sub-periods  between  1979  and  2008.  The  lines  indicate \nthe respective shares of Japan and the PRC in total US AD measures imposed in each of \nthe sub-periods. US targeting of Japan with AD reached its peak in the 1984\u20131988 period, \nwhen  the  US  imposed  more  than  20  new  import  restrictions  on  Japanese  exporting  firms; \nmeasures restricting imports from Japan alone accounted for more than 20% of all new AD \nmeasures the US imposed during that period. \n\n                                                 \n15Under  the  self-enforcing  WTO  system,  the  US  and  the  PRC  were  free  to  choose  this  option  as  long  as  no \n\ncountry filed a complaint. \n\n16Authors\u2019 estimates based on the data in Bown (2009a).

During  the  second  half  of  the  period  (1999\u20132008),  the  US \nimposed more than 50 new AD import restrictions on PRC exporters, and these restrictions \nwere roughly a third of all AD measures the US imposed during this period. \n\nFigure 3 illustrates the time pattern of US AD investigations and measures imposed against \nJapan (Panel A, 1979\u20132000) and against the PRC (Panel A, 1989\u20132007) as compared with \nthe  growth  of  the  US  bilateral  trade  deficit  (normalized  as  a  share  of  the  total  value  of \nbilateral  trade)  with  each  country.  The  data  show  a  strong  positive  correlation  over  time \nbetween the size of the bilateral trade deficit and the frequency with which the partner has \nbecome a target of US AD to limit the trading partner\u2019s export expansion into the US market. \nHowever,  while  US  AD  activity  against  Japan  began  to  decline  as  the  yen  rose  in  value \nrelative to the US dollar in 1985, AD activity against the PRC continued unabated even after \nthe yuan began to appreciate relative to the dollar in 2005. \n\n9 \n\n\f14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n \n\nBown and McCulloch \n\nFigure 3: The US Bilateral Trade Deficits and Use of Antidumping \n\nADBI Working Paper 158 \n \n\n3a: US-Japan, 1979\u20132000 \n\nUS AD\nInvestigations\nand Measures\nPer Year\n\nUS-Japan Bilateral Trade\nDeficit as a Share of\nTotal Value of Bilateral\nTrade\n\nAD\ninvestigations\n\nAD measures\n\nBilateral deficit\n(share of total\nbilateral trade)\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\nUS-PRC BilateralTrade\nDeficit as a Share of\nTotal Value of Bilateral\nTrade\n\nAD\ninvestigations\n\nAD measures\n\nBilateral deficit\n(share of total\nbilateral trade)\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n1979\n\n1982\n\n1985\n\n1988\n\n1991\n\n1994\n\n1997\n\n2000\n\n3b: US-PRC, 1989\u20132007 \n\nUS AD\nInvestigations\nand Measures\nPer Year\n\n1989\n\n1992\n\n1995\n\n1998\n\n2001\n\n2004\n\n2007\n\nAD = antidumping, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, US = United States. \n\nNotes: Light bars indicate the number of antidumping investigations initiated during those years that resulted in the \nimposition of final antidumping measures.

Interestingly, the US never used \nits countervailing duty law to address imports from Japan over the entire 1979\u20132008 period. \n\nFrom  1979  until  2006,  the  US  also  never  used  its  countervailing  duty  law  to  impose  new \nimport restrictions on the PRC. A 1984 policy decision of the US Department of Commerce \nexplicitly exempted the PRC cases from consideration under the countervailing duty statute. \nHowever, in November 2006, US producers of coated free sheet paper included the PRC in \na  petition  they  were  filing  against  Indonesia  and  Korea  over  alleged  subsidies.  In  March \n2007,  the  Commerce  Department  opened  the  door  for  the  US  to  begin  imposing \ncountervailing duties on imports from the PRC by reversing its earlier policy (Government of \nthe  US,  Department  of  Commerce  2007).  In  December  2007,  the  US  International  Trade \nCommission  (USITC)  made  a  negative  injury  determination  in  the  coated  free  sheet  paper \ncase,  and  no  duties  were  imposed.  However,  the  Commerce  Department\u2019s  2007  policy \nreversal allowed other US industries to request import protection against the PRC under the \ncountervailing  duty  law.  As  Table  3  indicates,  thirteen  additional  investigations  against  the \nPRC had been initiated as of April 2009, and all cases that had reached the stage of a final \ndecision resulted in the imposition of new countervailing duties, one as high as 226%. \nTable 3: US Countervailing Duty Investigations of the PRC, 2006\u20132009a \n\nNo.  Product \n\n1.

The  first  safeguard,  as  discussed  above,  was \nlimited  to  the  2001\u20132008  period,  covered  US  textiles  and  apparel  imports  only,  and  was \nadministered  by  the  Office  of  Textiles  and  Apparel  in  the  US  Department  of  Commerce. \nSeparately, under Section 421 of the US trade law, the US has access to a broader PRC-\nspecific safeguard through 2014, one that is administered in much the same way as the US \nglobal safeguards (Section 201) law, with injury investigations taking place at the USITC and \n\n11 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 158 \n \n\n \n\nBown and McCulloch \n\nthe  US  President  ultimately  granted  the  discretionary  authority  to  determine  any  policy \nresponse to the investigation. \n\nTable  4  lists  a  number  of  the  PRC-specific  safeguard  investigations  initiated  under  the \nSection  421  law  between  2002  and  2009.

This  has  been  especially  true  for  PRC  textiles  and  apparel,  where  other \ndeveloping  countries  share  the  PRC\u2019s  comparative  advantage  relative  to  the  US.  In  such \ncases,  restrictions  on  Japan  and  the  PRC  have  improved  the  relative  terms  of  US  import \nmarket access available to other exporters. However, in many cases, the US has created a \n\n12 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 158 \n \n\n \n\nBown and McCulloch \n\nsimilar relative advantage for other exporters through a variety of preferential (discriminatory) \ntrade arrangements. Most of these arrangements are permitted under GATT/WTO rules. \n\nTrading  partners  that  competed  with  Japan  in  the  US  market  and  benefited  from  formal \npreferential  trade  agreements  with  the  US  during  this  period  include  Israel  (1985)  and \nCanada  (1987).  With  the  growth  of  US  imports  from  the  PRC,  the  US  entered  into \npreferential  deals  with  Mexico  (North  American  Free  Trade  Agreement  [NAFTA]  in  1994), \nCentral  American  countries  and  the  Dominican  Republic  (Central  American  Free  Trade \nAgreement-Dominican Republic [CAFTA-DR] in 2004), Bahrain (2006), and Morocco (2006). \nThe  US  also  offered  various  groups  of  developing  countries  further  extensions  of  major \npreferential  programs.  These  included  the  Generalized  System  of  Preferences;  for \nCaribbean  nations,  the  Caribbean  Basin  Initiative  (1983,  substantially  expanded  in  2000 \nthrough the US-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act); for Andean countries, the Andean \nTrade  Preference  Act  (1992,  expanded  as  the  Andean  Trade  Promotion  and  Drug \nEradication Act under the Trade Act of 2002); and for countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the \nAfrican  Growth  and  Opportunity  Act  (2000,  revised  in  2002,  2004,  and  2006).  While  such \nspecial  preferential  arrangements  may  have  been  motivated  primarily  by  US  foreign-policy \nconsiderations rather than as a means to restore the market position of established suppliers \nto the US market, their result nonetheless is to improve the market access of firms in other \ncountries relative to their rivals in the PRC (for a detailed description of US trade preferences \nfor  various  groups  of  developing  countries,  see  http://www.ustr.gov/trade-topics/trade-\ndevelopment/preference-programs). \n\n4.  TREATING THE SYMPTOMS (2): US EFFORTS TO \nIMPROVE ITS EXPORTERS\u2019 MARKET ACCESS IN \nJAPAN AND THE PRC \n\nThe  second  strategy  a  country  facing  a  bilateral  trade  imbalance  due  to  continued  export \nexpansion into its market can use to rebalance concessions is to expand its own exporters\u2019 \naccess to the other country\u2019s market. The US has pursued this approach against Japan, and \nto a lesser extent more recently against the PRC, via a combination of formal trade disputes \ninitiated under the multilateral auspices of the GATT (1955\u20131994) and WTO (1995 onward) \ndispute-settlement systems, as well as its unilateral Section 301 law (1974 onward). Under \nSection 301 of the 1974 US Trade Act, a US export industry can petition the US government \nto take up its concern that it has lost foreign market access because another country is not \nliving up to a trade agreement it has signed with the US (Bhagwati and Patrick 1990; Bayard \nand Elliott 1994).17 Section 301 was strengthened and revitalized in 1988. \n\n4.1  US Formal Market-opening Actions against Japan \n\nWhen Japan joined the GATT in 1955, the country was still very poor. The post-World War II \noccupation  by  the  US  had  only  ended  in  1952,  and  Japan\u2019s  domestic  market  was  not  yet \nattractive to US exporters of manufactured goods. Japan had relied heavily on food imports \nfrom the US and other countries in the immediate postwar period, but as Japanese farmers \nrecovered  from  the  war,  the  demand  for  imported  food  waned.  Traditional  policies  of  self-\nsufficiency began to be restored, and in some cases US food exports were excluded. Thus, \nearly market-opening efforts focused on agricultural products. \n\nBy the mid-1970s, the US had adopted a more formal and legalistic approach to improving \nits  exporters\u2019  access  to  the  Japanese  market  through  the  combined  use  of  GATT  dispute \nsettlement  and  its  Section  301  policy.  Over  the  next  twenty  years,  US  officials  pursued  at \nleast  23  different  formal  actions  against  Japan  in  attempts  to  open  up  its  market  to  US \nexports. Figure 4 shows formal US market-opening initiatives against Japan and the bilateral \nUS-Japan trade deficit by year from 1965 through 2000. Similar to the US use of AD against \n\n                                                 \n17For a discussion of Section 301, see Bhagwati and Patrick (1990) and Bayard and Elliott (1994). \n\n13 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 158 \n \n\n \n\nBown and McCulloch \n\nimports from Japan as shown in Figure 3a, there is a strong positive correlation between the \nsize of the bilateral trade deficit and these formal US actions attempting to open up Japan\u2019s \nmarkets to US exports. \n\nFigure 4: The US-Japan Bilateral Trade Deficit and US Section 301, GATT, and WTO \nFormal Trade Dispute Activity against Japan, 1965\u20132000 \n\nCombined US\nMarket Access\nOpening Initiations\nagainst Japan\nPer Year\n\nTokyo\nRound\n\nUruguay\nRound\n\nUS-Japan Bilateral Trade\nDeficit as a Share of Total\nValue of Bilateral Trade\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n-0.1\n\nSection 301\ninvestigation,\nGATT dispute, or\nWTO dispute\n\nBilateral deficit\n(share of total\nbilateral trade)\n\n1965\n\n1970\n\n1975\n\n1980\n\n1985\n\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\nGATT = General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, US = United States,  \nWTO = World Trade Organization. \n\nSources: Section 301, GATT, and WTO dispute initiation data compiled by the authors from WTO (1995, 2009), \nBayard and Elliott (1994: 355\u2013465), and USTR (2009, various years). US-Japan bilateral trade data from  \nFeenstra et al. (2005). \n\n \n\nTable  5  presents  detailed  information  on  23  formal  Section  301,  GATT,  and  WTO  trade \ndisputes that the US initiated to open up Japan\u2019s market. While the US had begun using the \nGATT  dispute-settlement  provisions  in  1948,  it  did  not  file  its  first  formal  trade  dispute \nagainst  Japan  until  1977.18 US  use  of  GATT  dispute  settlement  in  the  attempt  to  open  up \nJapan\u2019s market to its firms was most frequent during the 1977\u20131988 period, when it filed a \ntotal of 11 formal disputes against Japan. Japan was clearly an important target for the US \nduring  this  period,  facing  nearly  a  third  of  the  35  GATT  trade  disputes  the  US  initiated. \nBeginning in 1989, partially out of frustration with the relatively toothless dispute-settlement \nprovisions of the GATT and partially as a negotiating tactic to increase the pressure on the \nother  GATT  contracting  parties  to  reform  the  dispute-settlement  provisions,  the  US  shifted \naway from using GATT dispute settlement and instead relied solely on its unilateral Section \n301  policy  tool  to  pursue  cases  against  Japan.  Whereas  all  but  one  of  the  Section  301 \ninvestigations  against Japan  during 1977\u20131988 resulted  in  the  US  bringing  a  formal  GATT \ntrade dispute, none of the next four Section 301 cases, initiated during 1989\u20131994, did so. \nThe  only  Section  301  investigation  of  Japan  during  1977\u20131988  that  did  not  lead  to  a  US-\ninitiated  GATT  dispute  was  the  semiconductor  case  initiated  in  1985.  In  the  WTO  era  that \nbegan  in  1995,  all  US  Section  301  investigations  of  Japan  have  been  forwarded  to  WTO \ndispute settlement, along with two other disputes that were not initiated through the Section \n301 channel. \n\n                                                 \n18This section draws on data compiled by Hudec (1993). The US was not the first country to file a formal GATT \ntrade  dispute  against  Japan.

In  the  1970s,  desired  market  access  was  primarily  in  agriculture-based  products \n(tobacco  and  leather)  and  lower  value-added  manufacturing  (silk,  cigars,  cigarettes, \nfootwear,  and  bats).  In  the  mid-1980s,  while  there  were  continued  pressures  to  obtain \nJapanese  market  access  for  US  agricultural  products  (dairy,  legumes,  starches,  sugars, \ngroundnuts,  pineapple,  tomato,  fish,  citrus,  and  beef)  and  also  wood  products,  there  were \nnew  issues  of  importance  to  U.S  exporters  as  well.  Some  of  this  involved  intellectual-\nproperty-intensive  export  products  where  the  US  had  a  strong  comparative  advantage \n(semiconductors, supercomputers, satellites, auto parts), but also involved were issue-areas \nand disciplines where the GATT rules were only slowly becoming responsive (e.g., trade in \nservices  [construction,  architectural,  engineering],  as  well  as  three  separate  disputes  over \nJapan\u2019s government-procurement procedures). \n\n4.2  US Formal Market-opening Actions against the PRC \n\nMoreover,  the  US  and  other  WTO  members  demanded  many  more  import  market-access \ncommitments than had previously been the case with new arrivals when they negotiated the \nterms of the PRC\u2019s accession to the WTO.19 When the PRC acceded to the WTO in 2001, it \nhad  cut  tariffs  significantly  on  a  broad  range  of  products,  making  its  applied  tariffs  both \nrelatively  low  and  quite  close  to  the  bound  rates.  As  Table  6  indicates,  the  PRC\u2019s  applied \nand bound tariffs in 2007 were only slightly higher than those of the US and Japan overall \nand  actually  lower  than  Japan\u2019s  in  certain  areas  (e.g.,  agriculture).  The  PRC\u2019s  tariffs  were \nalso much lower on average than those of other major emerging economies such as India \nand Brazil, countries that have been part of the GATT/WTO system for decades longer than \nthe PRC. \n\nTable 6: Applied Tariffs and Bindings for Selected WTO Members, 2007 \n\nWTO Member Country \nUnited States \n \n \n \nJapan \n \n \n \nPRC \n \n \n \nBrazil \n \n \n \nIndia \n \n \n \n\nProduct Category \nAll \nAgriculture \nNon-agriculture \nClothing \nAll \nAgriculture \nNon-agriculture \nClothing \nAll \nAgriculture \nNon-agriculture \nClothing \nAll \nAgriculture \nNon-agriculture \nClothing \nAll \nAgriculture \nNon-agriculture \nClothing \n\nBinding \ncoverage (%) \n100 \nna \n100 \n100 \n99.6 \nna \n99.6 \n100 \n100 \nna \n100 \n100 \n100 \nna \n100 \n100 \n73.8 \nna \n69.8 \n54.9 \n\nAverage Bound \nTariff (%) \n3.5 \n5.0 \n3.3 \n11.4 \n5.1 \n22.7 \n2.4 \n9.2 \n10.0 \n15.8 \n9.1 \n16.2 \n31.4 \n35.5 \n30.8 \n35.0 \n50.2 \n114.2 \n38.2 \n43.5 \n\nAverage Applied \nTariff (%) \n3.5 \n5.5 \n3.2 \n11.7 \n5.1 \n21.8 \n2.6 \n9.2 \n9.9 \n15.8 \n9.0 \n16.0 \n12.2 \n10.3 \n12.5 \n20.0 \n14.5 \n34.4 \n11.5 \n22.2 \n\nHS = harmonized system, na = not available, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, WTO = World Trade Organization. \n\nNotes: Binding coverage is defined as share of HS six-digit subheadings containing at least one bound tariff line. \nSimple averages are of the ad valorem (ad valorem equivalent) six-digit HS duty averages. \n\nSource: Compiled by the authors from WTO (2008c). \n\n                                                 \n19When  the  WTO  was  created  in  the  Uruguay  Round,  many  less-developed  countries  were  permitted  to  join \nwithout  special  conditions.

Thus, the PRC\u2019s 2001 entry did \nnot substantially reduce the US applied tariffs faced by PRC exporters, although it did increase the certainty of \nthat treatment. \n\n21Indeed, the shift toward US use of countervailing duty policy against the PRC described above and illustrated in \nTable  3  may  reflect  the  US  desire  to  speed  the  elimination  of  the  PRC\u2019s  domestic  subsidy  programs,  which \nincrease the PRC\u2019s ability to export while reducing foreign access to the PRC\u2019s domestic market. \n\n17 \n\n\f1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\nYear  \n\n2004 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2008 \n\nADBI Working Paper 158 \n \n\n \n\nBown and McCulloch \n\nTable 7: US-Initiated WTO Trade Disputes over Access to the PRC\u2019s Import Market, \n2001\u20132008 \n\nNo.  Product/Policy-Complainant(s) and Issue \n\nIntegrated circuits\u2013US alleged that the PRC\u2019s domestic value-added tax and \nrebate scheme violated national treatment thus discriminating against imports \n\nAutomobile parts\u2013US, EC, and Canada alleged that the PRC\u2019s policies violated \nrules on national treatment and subsidies and created disincentives for domestic \nauto manufactures to use imported parts \n\nRefunds, reductions or exemptions from taxes and other payments\u2013US and \nMexico alleged that the PRC\u2019s policies granted WTO-inconsistent subsidies \ngranted if firms purchased domestic over imported goods or on the condition that \nfirms meet export criterion \n\n4.

The \nabsence of unilateral actions is especially significant given that the US Trade Representative \n(USTR)  has  received  a  number  of  petitions  to  investigate  the  PRC  under  Section  301.  In \neach year between 2004 and 2007, the USTR received at least one petition requesting the \nuse  of  Section  301  to  investigate  the  PRC\u2019s  exchange  rate  or  manufacturing  labor  rights, \nalleging  that  undervaluation  of  the PRC\u2019s  currency  constitutes  a  WTO-inconsistent subsidy \nor  that  its  mistreatment  of  manufacturing  workers  affects  US  market  access.  In  each \ninstance, the USTR has declined to investigate the issue of the petition.  \n\n5.  ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS SYSTEMIC ISSUES THROUGH \n\nNEW GATT/WTO DISCIPLINES \n\nIn addition to efforts to provide \u201csymptomatic relief\u201d for the large bilateral imbalances via US \nimport  restrictions  and  export  promotion,  US  policy  makers  also  undertook  actions  to \naddress what they perceived as important underlying causes of the persistent imbalances. In \n\n18 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 158 \n \n\n \n\nBown and McCulloch \n\nthis section we describe these underlying causes (as portrayed by US officials and the US \npublic  at  large)  and  the  consequences  for  the  international  trading  system  of  US  efforts  to \naddress those causes.  \n\nAs we describe in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, a common view in the US during both episodes was \nthat inappropriate foreign government interference with market forces lay at the root of the \nimbalances. This perception led naturally to US efforts to use (and modify) the rules-based \ntrading system to address the troubling imbalances in a systematic way. The differences in \nthe  bilateral  imbalance  that  the  US  faced  with  Japan  versus  its  bilateral  problem  with  the \nPRC are found in the details. Finally, Section 5.3 discusses some unintended consequences \nof  the  evolution  of  the  trading  system  from  the  perspective  of  the  US\u2014in  particular,  how \nJapan  and  the  PRC  have  used  the  WTO  dispute  settlement  process  to  self-enforce  their \nexporters\u2019 access to the US market. \n\n5.1  US-Japan Conflict and the Reach of WTO Disciplines \n\nUS  priorities  in  the  Uruguay  Round  were  shaped  by  dissatisfaction  arising  from  US \nexporters\u2019 inability over several decades to access certain export markets, especially that of \nJapan. This is clearly reflected in Table 5, which lists the exported products and disciplines \nat the heart of the formal actions (Section 301 and GATT disputes) the US initiated against \nJapan during the 1977\u20131994 period. \n\nIn the Uruguay Round, the US sought to negotiate more rules and greater transparency, as \nwell  as  extending  disciplines  in  areas  such  as  \u201cstandards\u201d  (including  the  Agreements  on \nSanitary  and  Phytosanitary  Measures  and  Technical  Barriers  to  Trade),  government \nprocurement, trade in services (General Agreement on Trade in Services [GATS]), subsidies \n(SCM Agreement), and intellectual property rights protection (TRIPS). All countries also had \nto accept new disciplines over trade in agriculture (subsidies and domestic support) as well \nas clothing and textiles through the phase-out of the MFA. \n\nWe have already seen some of the results in the context of our discussion of WTO disputes \nbrought by the US against Japan since 1995 (see Table 5), which put the new rules to the \ntest. One example is a 1995 WTO dispute under the new TRIPS agreement, in which the US \nalleged  that  Japan  was  not  sufficiently  protecting  the  copyrights  of  US  musical  artists  for \ntheir past performances and sound recordings. The US also quickly tested the reach of the \nnew  GATS  in  the  highly  publicized  1995  Kodak-Fuji  dispute,  in  which  it  alleged  that \nJapanese  government  policies  were  the  cause  of  Kodak\u2019s  inability  to  gain  access  to  the \nJapanese market for photographic film and paper. Finally, US agricultural interests continued \nto play a role as the US pursued standards cases under the new Agreement on Sanitary and \nPhytosanitary  Measures.  The  US  demanded  that  Japan  remove  burdensome  import \nrestrictions  and  testing  requirements  for  various  US  fruit  exports,  arguing  that  such  trade \nbarriers could not be justified on the basis of scientific risk assessments as required under \nthe new WTO disciplines. \n\n5.2  US-PRC Conflict and the Reach of WTO Disciplines \n\nPerhaps  the  most  fundamental  issue  raised  by  the  PRC\u2019s  entry  is  its  legacy  as  a  centrally \nplanned  economy.  Although  industrial  policy  has  now  been  decentralized  to  a  significant \nextent, explicit and implicit subsidies remain an integral part of the nation\u2019s industrial policy. \nUnder the terms of its accession agreement it is still accorded non-market-economy status, \nwhich  in  practice  has  translated  into  huge  dumping  margins  and  AD  duties.  Along  with \nremaining cash subsidies and tax rebates, the PRC continues to provide financial support to \nstate-owned enterprises (SOEs), easy access to loans for preferred companies and sectors, \nand  administrative  guidance  favoring  FDI  in  preferred  sectors,  as  well  as  persistent \nexchange-rate  undervaluation  (with  the  effect  of  protecting  all  domestic  producers  from \ncompeting imports and subsidizing all exporters). \n\nCurrent  trade  rules  cover  explicit  cash  subsidies  and  some  tax  rebates,  but  the  protected \nstatus  of  SOEs  and  governmental  discretion  in  the  allocation  of  financial  capital  have \n\n19 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 158 \n \n\n \n\nBown and McCulloch \n\nparallels  in  the  policies  and  practice  of  many  other  member  countries.  WTO  disciplines \nregarding  trade-related  investment  are  weak  at  best,  and  the  WTO  has  no  explicit \n(actionable) mechanisms for dealing with a country\u2019s manipulation of its exchange rate as an \nimplicit  means  of  favoring  national  firms  over  their  foreign  rivals  in  domestic  or  export \nmarkets. \n\nWith the opportunity to negotiate the terms of the PRC\u2019s entry into the WTO, countries that \nhad already attained membership were able to extract massive accession commitments from \nthe  PRC.  These  included  commitments  by  the  PRC  to  scaling  back  explicit  subsidies  to \nSOEs  and  reforming  the  banking  sector.  However,  given  the  self-enforcing  nature  of  the \nWTO system, other members must enforce the PRC\u2019s commitment to reining in subsidies by \ninitiating formal WTO complaints under the WTO\u2019s dispute settlement understanding (DSU). \nMoreover,  since  there  is  no  explicit  WTO  mechanism  for  dealing  with  the  issue  of  implicit \nsubsidization  via  currency  undervaluation,  even  countries  seeking  to  contest  the  PRC\u2019s \nexplicit  subsides  through  the  DSU  must  resort  to  other  policy  options  to  confront  the \ncurrency issue. \n\nWTO members have used two approaches to confront the PRC subsidy problem. The first, \nused by the US, is to initiate anti-subsidy disputes at the WTO (see Table 7). Through 2008, \nthe  PRC  has  settled  every  WTO  dispute  over  subsidies  with  a  promise  to  remove  the \nallegedly  WTO-inconsistent  measure.  The  only  exception  is  the  \u201cFamous  Brands\u201d  case, \nwhich was initiated only in December 2008.22 The alternative way to contest the PRC\u2019s use \nof subsidies is for affected countries to facilitate use by their domestic firms of the country\u2019s \nown countervailing duty law. There is evidence (see Table 3) that WTO members including \nthe US are using this second route. \n\n5.3  New Rules and the Ability of Japan and the PRC to Self-enforce \n\nUS Market Access \n\nUS  actions  in  the  Uruguay  Round  also  had  an  important  influence  on  the  negotiating \npositions  of  other  countries.  The  new  WTO  Agreement  on  Safeguards  banned  the  use  of \nVERs,  an  attempt  to  halt  the  proliferation  of  VERs  that  began  in  the  1960s  and  continued \nthrough  the  1990s  (Bown  2002b).23 US  resort  to  \u201caggressive  unilateralism\u201d  and  retaliation \nthreats through its increasingly active use of the Section 301 policy in the 1988\u20131994 period \nhelped convince Japan and other US trading partners to accept a more binding and legalistic \nsystem of dispute settlement, resulting in the WTO DSU. \n\nTable 8 shows how Japan has used the WTO (and GATT) dispute settlements against the \nUS. While Japan rarely used formal dispute settlement against the US during the GATT era, \nit has been much more active during the WTO period. The clear focus of Japan\u2019s WTO trade \ndispute  efforts  has  been  on  reforming  US  use  of  AD.  This  is  not  surprising,  given  that \nUruguay Round negotiators failed to agree on new rules to discipline use of AD.24 Japan has \nfiled  disputes  over  US  imposition  of  AD  measures  on  specific  Japanese  exports  \n\n                                                 \n22Perhaps in preparation for the possibility that the parties to a future dispute are unable to negotiate a settlement \nand the dispute goes to WTO adjudication, PRC officials are becoming well informed on WTO rules and case \nlaw  regarding  subsidies  and  countervailing  measures.  As  Bown  (forthcoming)  indicated,  the  PRC  has  been \nclosely  following  the  evolution  of  WTO  rulings  on  subsidies  in  other  countries\u2019  disputes  (see  Tables).  As  of \nearly  2009,  the  PRC  had  participated  as  an  \u201cinterested  third  party\u201d  in  over  a  dozen  formal  WTO  disputes \ninvolving other countries\u2019 subsidy issues. \n\n23While VERs are banned under the Agreement on Safeguards, they are implicitly encouraged elsewhere in the \nWTO  Agreements  (e.g.,  through  encouragement  of  \u201cprice  undertakings\u201d  by  targeted  exporting  firms  in \ninvestigations  under  the  WTO  Antidumping  Agreement).  Moreover,  because  the  WTO  is  a  self-enforcing \nsystem,  VERs  can  still  be  negotiated  provided  that  no  member  complains.  Because  in  many  instances  the \nexporting country is better off under a VER than under the likely alternative (usually a higher import duty levied \nunder some other policy), there may be no \u201cparty\u201d (member) to complain. Consumers of the affected imports \nand taxpayers in the importing country are likely to lose, but they have no direct standing in the WTO system. \n24One consequence of the failure of the US and other WTO members to address AD reform is that the use of AD \nhas  proliferated  globally  across  the  WTO  membership.  Indeed,  the  most  frequent  users  of  AD  are  now \ndeveloping countries, with other developing country exporters, especially the PRC, a frequent target. \n\n20 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 158 \n \n\n \n\nBown and McCulloch \n\n(e.g., hot rolled steel). Japan also challenged the little-used \u201cother\u201d US AD law (Antidumping \nAct  of  1916)  as  WTO-inconsistent  because  it  allows  for  punitive  damages  beyond  the \nimposition  of  ad  valorem  duties,  and  Japan  joined  the  collective  challenge  to  the  US  Byrd \nAmendment,  which  required  AD  duties  collected  from  foreign  firms  to  be  refunded  to  the \ndomestic  US  firms  behind  the  AD  petition.  Japan  has  also  challenged  the  Department  of \nCommerce\u2019s  use  of  \u201czeroing\u201d  to  inflate  dumping  margins  and  thus  justify  higher  AD  duties \n(see Bown and Sykes 2008). Finally, Japan challenged the way in which the US conducts its \n\u201csunset  reviews.\u201d  These  reviews  are  supposed  to  lead  to  the  removal  of  the  imposed  AD \nduties after five years, but in most instances US duties have remained in place well beyond \nthe five-year limit. \n\nTable 8: Japan and PRC Use of GATT and WTO Dispute Settlement to Challenge the \nUnited States, 1955\u20132009a \n\nNo.  Product/Policy-Complainant(s) and Issue \n1. \n\nCountervailing duty calculation (\u201cZenith Case\u201d) b,c\u2013Japan alleged as GATT-inconsistent the \nUS procedure for calculating subsidies during countervailing duty investigations in a way that \npenalizes trading partner exemption of exporters from indirect taxes (e.g., VAT schemes) \nSemiconductor retaliationa\u2013Japan alleged that the US violated GATT obligations by unilaterally \nraising tariffs against Japan\u2019s exports in a disagreement over whether Japan was abiding by the \n1986 bilateral semiconductor agreement \nSection 301 import duties on autos\u2013Japan alleged as WTO-inconsistent the proposed US \nretaliation during the US Section 301 investigation of Japan\u2019s market access for foreign auto parts \nGovernment procurement\u2013Japan and EC alleged as a WTO violation of the Government \nProcurement Act the Massachusetts \u201cBurma Act\u201d legislation banning the state government from \npurchasing from persons who do business with Burma  \nAD Act of 1916\u2013Japan and the EC alleged that the US Antidumping Act of 1916 was WTO-\ninconsistent as it allowed for imposition of penalties beyond the imposition of duties allowed by the \nAgreement on Antidumping and thus had a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on exporters \nAD on hot-rolled steel\u2013Japan alleged that the US violated obligations by imposing WTO-\ninconsistent antidumping duties on hot rolled steel products  \nByrd Amendment\u2013Japan, the EC, and nine other countries alleged the US \u201cContinued Dumping \nand Subsidy Offset Act of 2000\u201d policy of refunding to domestic petitioners the collected foreign \nduties after affirmative antidumping and countervailing duty investigations was a WTO-\ninconsistent subsidy \nSunset review of AD on steel\u2013Japan alleged as WTO-inconsistent the US procedure for \nconducting a \u201csunset review\u201d for removing antidumping duties on imports of corrosion-resistant \nsteel \nSteel safeguards\u2013PRC, Japan, the EC, and six other countries alleged as WTO-inconsistent the \n2002 US imposition of an import safeguard on a variety of steel products \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\n9. \n\n10.

The PRC\u2019s approach been similar to that of Japan, but its \nactivity  has  been  more  limited.  On  the  complainant  side,  the  PRC\u2019s  only  involvement  in  a \nformal  dispute  prior  to  2007  was  the  challenge  it  joined  with  Japan,  the  EC,  and  six  other \nWTO  members  seeking  removal  of  the  steel  safeguard  import  restrictions  imposed  by  the \nUS in 2002. \n\nSince  2007,  however,  the  PRC  has  begun  to  challenge  US  use  of  AD  and \ncountervailing  duty  policies.  The  first  dispute  the  PRC  initiated  against  the  US  (after  the \nimposition of a preliminary duty) became moot after the USITC found no evidence of injury, \nand  so  no  final  duties  were  imposed,  as  discussed  in  Section  3.  However,  in  response  to \nincreasing US AD activity (see Figures 2 and 3b) and the new US stance on countervailing \nduty use (see Table 3), in 2008 the PRC initiated a challenge to the US laws in the first four \ninstances  in  which  the  PRC\u2019s  exporters  were  targeted  with  US  countervailing  duty \ninvestigations.  In  April  2009,  the  PRC  initiated  its  first  challenge  to  trade  barriers  over  a \nstandards issue, questioning whether the US ban on poultry imports from the PRC could be \njustified scientifically. \n\n6.  MACROECONOMIC ROOTS OF TRADE FRICTIONS \n\nIn previous sections, we have focused mainly on US trade policy responses at the industry \nor  product  level,  and  also  US  efforts  to  address  certain  systemic  features  of  the  partner \neconomy,  especially  industrial  policy  and  exchange-rate  undervaluation,  that  are  widely \nbelieved to confer an artificial competitive advantage relative to US firms. In this section, we \nexamine  the  trade  imbalances  from  a  macroeconomic  perspective,  and  we  indicate \nsimilarities  and  differences  for  the  cases  of  Japan  and  the  PRC.  Insights  from  the \nmacroeconomic roots of the imbalance help to explain how imbalance episodes develop and \nalso why they end. \n\nThe  macroeconomic  analysis  begins  from  the  accounting  identity  that  a  nation\u2019s  current \naccount  balance  must  be  equal  to  the  difference  between  the  nation\u2019s  saving  and  its \ndomestic investment.25 Equivalently, a nation\u2019s current account balance must be equal to the \ndifference  between  its  domestic  production  and  its  total  domestic  spending  for  goods  and \nservices\u2014consumption,  domestic  investment,  and  government.  Any  shortfall  must  be \nmatched by an equal net capital inflow from abroad. Roughly speaking, the country\u2019s ability \nto  \u201clive  beyond  its  means\u201d  in  a  particular  year  must  be  financed  through  borrowing  from \nabroad.26 Likewise, a country with a current-account surplus must have saving that exceeds \nits domestic investment and thus makes a net addition to national holdings of foreign assets.  \n\nAn identity is simply a relationship that must hold at all times; it is not a theory that relates \ncause  and  effect.  In  practice,  many  economic  variables  can  adjust  simultaneously  to \nmaintain the relationship described by the identity. These include not only the components of \nthe  identity,  but  also  variables  that  influence  them,  such  as  interest  rates,  exchange  rates, \nand  capital-market  development.  Moreover,  if  a  new  policy  changes  one  variable  directly, \nother induced changes may offset its impact. For example, if a country attempts to improve \nits  trade  balance  only  by  raising  all  tariffs  on  imports,  thus  reducing  imports,  induced \nchanges  might  include  an  exchange-rate  appreciation,  which  would  in  turn  encourage \n                                                 \n25The current account balance is the balance on goods and services trade plus net earnings of factors employed \nabroad  plus  net  unilateral  transfers.  In  a  very  simple  world  of  barter  trade  in  which  exports  and  imports  of \ngoods  and  services  are  the  only  international  transactions,  the  trade  balance  is  the  same  as  the  current \naccount balance. In practice, movements in the US merchandise trade balance (our main focus elsewhere in \nthis paper) are closely linked to movements in the current account. \n\n26More precisely, foreign acquisitions of US assets in that year must exceed US residents\u2019 acquisitions of foreign \nassets.  However,  equities  and  similar  ownership  claims  do  not  reflect  borrowing  and  lending.  For  example, \n\u201cforeign  acquisitions  of  US  assets\u201d  can  include  greenfield  construction  of  new  foreign-owned  manufacturing \nfacilities  in  the  US  or  sale  of  an  interest  in  an  existing  US  business  to  foreign  investors.  The  statement  may \nalso  be  misleading  in  implying  that  it  is  international  borrowing  that  must  adjust  to  cover  the  gap  between \ndomestic production and domestic demand for goods and services. \n\n22 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 158 \n \n\n \n\nBown and McCulloch \n\nimports and reduce exports. The identity, however, does show how the external imbalance \nrelates  to  aggregates  in  the  domestic  economy,  and  particularly  national  saving.  No  set  of \npolicies  can  reduce  the  US  current-account  deficit  unless  they  result  in  higher  national \nsaving, lower domestic investment, or both.27 \n\nA  country\u2019s  saving  consists  of  two  parts:  private  saving  and  government  (public)  saving. \nGovernment saving is equal to the fiscal surplus or deficit. Private saving in turn consists of \nhousehold  saving  and  corporate  saving.  This  decomposition  is  significant  because  the \ngrowth of US current account and trade deficits have occurred in tandem with rapid declines \nin US national saving. Although US saving dropped during both periods of bilateral conflict, \nthe  causes  of  the  two  drops  were  different.28 In  the  1980s,  the  growth  of  the  US  bilateral \ntrade  deficit  with  Japan  occurred  during  a  period  when  the  federal  budget  deficit  was  also \ngrowing  (i.e.,  government  saving  was  falling).  This  is  the  situation  often  described  as  the \n\u201ctwin deficits.\u201d However, the ballooning US-PRC trade imbalances since the late 1990s have \nbeen  associated  with  a  steep  decline  in  US  private  saving,  as  well  as  a  return  to  a \nsubstantial fiscal deficit that began only in 2002. In 2008, a large federal deficit together with \nnegative gross private saving produced a drop in US gross saving to 11.9% of gross national \nproduct (GNP), compared with around 20% at the start of the 1980s and a peak of 18.2% as \nrecently as 1998. \n\nThroughout  the  paper,  we  have  focused  on  bilateral  imbalances.  In  a  world  of  many \ncountries,  a  US  saving-investment  gap  must  be  matched  by  a  US  current-account  deficit \nwith  the  rest  of  the  world  as  a  whole.  Since  the  early  1990s,  the  US  has  had  a  deficit  on \ngoods trade with most global regions, not only with Japan and the PRC (see Figure 5). Mann \n(2004) termed the alignment of US and foreign structural characteristics and policy choices \nduring this period \u201cglobal co-dependency\u201d\u2014with the US increasingly serving as a \u201cbuyer of \nlast resort\u201d for producers throughout the world (see Mann 2002, 2004).29 How the resulting \noverall  US  trade  deficit  is  divided  across  particular  trading  partners  depends  on  other \ncountries\u2019  own  macroeconomic  relationships,  as  well  as  the  countries\u2019  exchange  rates \nrelative to the dollar and comparative advantages relative to the US. A necessary condition \nfor  a  large  bilateral  deficit  is  a  saving  shortfall  relative  to  domestic  investment  in  the  US \ntogether  with  a  corresponding  savings  surplus  in  the  partner  country.  Both  Japan  and  the \nPRC (as well as smaller East Asian countries) have high saving rates, and both have overall \ncurrent-account  surpluses  (i.e.,  they  are  net  purchasers  of  foreign  assets).  Thus,  we  can \nalso  think  of  a  given  partner\u2019s  net  saving  financing  US  spending  (private  or  government) \nthrough purchases of US assets. In fact, both Japan and the PRC have accumulated large \nquantities of US assets, including but not limited to US government securities, in both cases \nhelping to maintain a currency that many considered \u201cundervalued\u201d relative to the dollar. \n\nOne  interesting  comparison  that  cannot  yet  be  completed  concerns  the  ends  of  the  two \nepisodes. Japan-bashing was moderated by the rapid appreciation of the yen relative to the \ndollar that began in 1985 and slowed to a crawl during Japan\u2019s \u201clost decade\u201d in the 1990s. \nAlthough  Japan\u2019s  overall  trade  surplus  persisted,  its  share  in  the  overall  US  trade  deficit \npeaked in 1991 at about 66% and fell subsequently. By 2008, US-Japan trade accounted for \nonly  about  8%  of  the  overall  US  merchandise  trade  deficit.  In  part,  this  shift  reflects  the \nrelocation  of  some  production  for  the  US  market  from  Japan  to  the  PRC  (including  Hong \nKong, China, which reverted to PRC control in 1997), with Japanese multinationals exporting \n\n                                                 \n27See McCulloch (1990) on the macroeconomic roots of the US-Japan current account imbalance in the 1980s. \nIto  (2009)  compared  the  US-Japan  imbalance  of  the  1980s  with  the  US-PRC  imbalance  in  the  2000s.  His \nempirical  analysis  confirmed  a  significant  causal  role  of  budget  balances  in  determining  current-account \nimbalances.  However,  he  also  concluded  that  the  Japanese  current-account  surpluses  of  the  1980s  were \ndriven by underperformance of investment rather than over-saving. \n\n28US Bureau of Economic Analysis, National Income and Product Accounts, Table 5.1, shows the decomposition \n\nfor each quarter of US saving into private saving and government saving. \n\n29Mann  (2004),  writing  during  a  period  of  dollar  depreciation,  used  the  term  \u201cco-dependency\u201d  to  describe  the \ncomplementary  domestic  macroeconomic  imbalances  and  emphasizes  that  currency  realignments  alone \ncannot correct the US external imbalance. \n\n23 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 158 \n \n\n \n\nBown and McCulloch \n\nintermediate  parts  to  their  PRC  subsidiaries  and  a  large  share  of  the  final  output  exported \nfrom the PRC to the US.30 \n\nIn  a  prescient  discussion  of  a  US  external  imbalance  that  was  already  massive  and  still \nrising  in  2004,  Mann  (2004:  20)  wrote,  \u201cThere  is  a  real  possibility  that  the  entanglements \ncreated  by  this  co-dependency  cannot  be  undone  by  anything  short  of  a  global  economic \ncrisis.\u201d  Indeed,  the  global  recession  that  began  in  2008  did  reduce  the  saving/investment \nimbalances underlying the huge overall US trade deficit and the bilateral trade deficit with the \nPRC. US gross saving as a share of GNP reached a minimum in the second quarter of 2008 \nand then trended upward, while gross domestic investment began to fall in the third quarter. \nAlthough  both  imports  and  exports  fell,  exports  fell  by  less.  The  US  trade  and  current \naccount deficits both narrowed in early 2009. \n\nMeanwhile,  slow  or  even  negative  growth  of  income  in  most  countries  worldwide  caused \ndemand for PRC exports to fall sharply. To maintain the pace of its economic growth, PRC \npolicy makers implemented a major domestic stimulus, and saving fell relative to investment. \nIn  early  2009,  the  PRC\u2019s  trade  surplus  also  fell  from  the  record  level  attained  in  2008. \nAccordingly,  the  PRC\u2019s  international  reserves  grew  more  slowly  than  in  recent  years.  The \nPRC  sold  a  substantial  volume  of  US  Treasury  securities  and  other  foreign  bonds  in  early \n2009 before resuming purchases in March. \n\n7.  CONCLUSIONS \n\nA  goal  of  this  paper  was  to  provide  a  framework  that  allows  us  to  make  sense  of  the  US-\nJapan  and  US-PRC  trade  relationships  over  the  past  thirty  years,  seeing  similarities  and \ndifferences as well as implications for evolution of the rules-based GATT/WTO system. The \ncentral  similarity  in  the  two  bilateral  relationships  is  the  huge  bilateral  trade  imbalance,  a \nreflection  of  the  export-led  growth  strategies  of  theses  countries,  but  also  of  underlying \nmacroeconomic  conditions.  In  both  cases,  the  result  has  been  a  strain  on  the  reciprocity-\nbased trading system. We have looked at the imbalance as the result of exports that grew \ntoo  quickly  and  imports  that  grew  too  slowly,  but  in  both  cases,  the  US  public  and \ngovernment  officials  chose  to  interpret  the  imbalance  as  a  symptom  of  non-market \nconsiderations.  In  both  cases,  the  official  responses  included  both  policies  that  addressed \nthe  symptoms  as  well  as  efforts  to  remedy  features  of  the  partner  economy  that  were \nperceived  as  underlying  causes.  In  both  cases,  however,  the  US  public  and  government \nofficials  were  slow  to  acknowledge  the  underlying  cause  at  home:  the  very  low  US  saving \nrate and a resulting domestic macroeconomic imbalance that translated into a large external \nimbalance.31 \n\nOn  the  import  side,  the  two  cases are  similar  in  that  the  US  resorted  to  VERs  and  AD,  as \nwell as negotiation of preferential agreements with traditional suppliers of relevant imported \nproducts  in  both  cases.  One  difference  is  that  the  US  has  recently  begun  using \ncountervailing  duties  against  the  PRC,  an  approach  it  did  not  take  with  Japan.  Another \ndifference  is  the  use  of  the  PRC-specific  safeguards  negotiated  when  the  PRC  joined  the \nWTO. \n\nOn  the  export  side,  use  of  US  Section  301  and  GATT  dispute  settlement  against  Japan  in \nthe 1977\u20131994 period looks similar to the use of WTO dispute settlement against the PRC \nsince 2006. Differences are more subtle; not surprisingly, US efforts in both cases reflected \ndominant  export  interests  at  the  time.  In  the  case  of  Japan,  the  role  of  keiretsu  and  active \nindustrial policy were seen as an important part of the problem. In the case of the PRC, the \n\n                                                 \n30The full export price of these goods is reflected in the statistics on US-PRC trade even when PRC value-added \n\nis only a fraction of this price. \n\n31The  official  position  of  the  US  may  be  shifting  toward  greater  acceptance  of  the  role  of  US  macro  policy  in \nsustaining  the  imbalance.  In  a  major  speech  at  Beijing  University  on  1  June  2009,  US  Treasury  Secretary \nTimothy Geithner explicitly acknowledged the need for the US to increase private saving and reduce the fiscal \ndeficit.  Similar  to  many  past  public  pronouncements  of  US  officials,  he  also  called  for  the  PRC  to  shift  away \nfrom export-driven growth by strengthening domestic demand. \n\n24 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 158 \n \n\n \n\nBown and McCulloch \n\nlegacy of a non-market system remains an issue, even though an increasing share of import-\ncompeting products and exports come from parts of the economy where private ownership \nand market forces are strong. \n\nUS frustration with its lack of success in prying open the Japanese market led to new rules \nintroduced  into  the  WTO  system  (i.e.,  Agreement  on  the  Application  of  Sanitary  and \nPhysosanitary  Measures,  Technical  Barriers \nto  Trade  Agreement,  Government \nProcurement,  Information  Technology,  TRIPS,  and  Agriculture)  in  the  Uruguay  Round \nnegotiations. The most important change, however, was the introduction of a new system of \ndispute  resolution  with  \u201cteeth,\u201d  though  this  required  the  US  to  modify  the  aggressive \nunilateralism that had characterized its approach to trade policy in the pre-WTO period. As \nwe  have  noted,  no  progress  has  been  made  on  AD,  although  the  improved  dispute-\nsettlement system may help to address this problem over time. \n\nLooking ahead to new issues, prospects for global negotiations are now dominated by two \nissues that overshadow the ones that constituted the Doha Round agenda as well as others \nthat have vied for public attention most recently (e.g., contaminated foods and unsafe toys). \nOne  major  new  issue  is  the  global  recession,  with  the  associated  decline  in  the  volume  of \nworld trade and the rise of new protectionism. The second is climate change and the trade-\npolicy  implications  of  efforts  to  limit  carbon  emissions\u2014and  to  deal  with  \u201ccarbon  leakage\u201d \nfrom countries not willing to join in these efforts. the PRC in particular has already been the \nmajor target of a surge of WTO-legal administered protection and is likely also to be a major \ntarget  of  efforts  to  penalize  imports  from  countries  that  do  not  sign  on  to  new  multilateral \narrangements on carbon emissions.32 \n\n                                                 \n32Because of the PRC\u2019s heavy reliance on coal-fired power plants, most analysts have assumed the PRC will lag \nwealthier trading partners in efforts to limit carbon omissions and that border measures associated with a new \nglobal  regime  would  therefore  reduce  the  international  competitiveness  of  PRC  exports.  However,  the  PRC \nhas  recently  taken  the  world  lead  in  building  coal-fired  power  plants  that  are  efficient  and  less  polluting \n(Bradsher  2009)  and  has  also  moved  forward  rapidly  with  wind  and  nuclear  power  generation.  By  mastering \nclean  technologies  and  driving  down  costs,  the  PRC  may  emerge  as  a  major  exporter  of  the  environmental \ncapital goods needed to implement ambitious goals regarding carbon emissions. \n\n25 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 158 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\nBown and McCulloch \n\nBagwell, K., and R.

While  other  Asian  countries  have  done  likewise,  the  cases  of \nJapan and the People\u2019s Republic of China are of particular interest because their economies \nare so large and the size of the associated bilateral trade imbalances with the United States \n(US) so conspicuous. In this paper, we focus on the significant spillovers to the international \ntrading  system  from  US  efforts  to  restore  the  reciprocal  General  Agreement  on  Trade  and \nTariffs (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) market-access bargain in the face \nof such large imbalances. The paper highlights similarities and differences in the two cases, \nincluding  the  role  of  explicit  and  implicit  subsidies,  foreign  direct  investment,  technology \ntransfer,  and  currency  misalignment.  We  explore  US  attempts  to  reduce  the  bilateral \nimbalances through targeted trade policies intended to slow growth of US imports from these \ncountries  or  increase  growth  of  US  exports  to  them.  We  then  examine  how  these  trade \npolicy  responses,  as  well  as  US  efforts  to  address  what  were  perceived  as  underlying \ncauses  of  the  imbalances,  influenced  the  evolution  of  the  international  trading  system. \nFinally,  we  compare  the  macroeconomic  conditions  associated  with  the  bilateral  trade \nimbalances and their implications for the conclusions of the two episodes. \n", " \nJEL Classification: F13 \n", " \n"]}
