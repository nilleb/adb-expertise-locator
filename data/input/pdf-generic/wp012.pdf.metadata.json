Within a fixed exchange rate regime, two\nvariants can be conceived: (i) a currency board arrangement or its equivalent,\nthe domestic usage of the currency of another country; and (ii) adoption of a\nnew common currency by a group of countries, or the formation of a monetary\nunion. This paper assesses the costs and benefits of the second variant for the\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The paper concludes that\nalthough the constraints on the adoption of a common currency by ASEAN are\nformidable, the long-run goal of a common currency for the region may be worth\nconsidering seriously, especially because, judged by the criterion of optimum\ncurrency area, the region is as suitable for the adoption of a common currency\nas Europe was prior to the Maastricht Treaty.\n\n16\n\n\f(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:5)(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:4)\n\nThe 1997 Asian  financial  crisis  has  brought  into  sharp focus  questions about  appropriate\n\nexchange rate regimes for the economies in the region. In the aftermath of the crisis, with\nthe notable exception of Malaysia, many countries in the region have now shifted toward\ngreater  flexibility  in  their  exchange  rates,  although,  for  various  reasons  including  the  \u201cfear  of\nfloating\u201d, official interventions in the foreign exchange market to stabilize rates are not uncom-\nmon. While these countries are experimenting with changes in the exchange rate regimes, a lively\ndebate is continuing on the choice of appropriate exchange rate regimes for developing countries.\nSince the Asian crisis, a popular view among academic economists and policymakers is\nthat developing countries with open capital accounts have a bipolar solution to the exchange rate\ndilemma they face:  a free float or a hard peg. This paper assesses the costs and benefits of a hard\npeg, specifically the use of a common currency or formation of a monetary union, for the Associa-\ntion of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).\n\nGiven that the adoption of a common currency, or the formation of a currency union, was\nthe last step in a sequence of policy initiatives toward regional economic integration in Europe\nthat spanned more than four decades, the ASEAN may perhaps be a long way away from adopting\na common currency. Yet, a debate on the adoption of a common currency by these countries is\nslowly emerging especially in the aftermath of the Asian crisis and after the single currency for\nEurope, the Euro, became a reality beginning 1999.\n\nThis paper aims to integrate and synthesize key conclusions in the literature and raise\ncertain issues for further debate and research, rather than break new grounds through fresh re-\nsearch. The assessment is largely organized around some of the well-known results, both theoreti-\ncal and empirical, of works on optimum currency area (OCA).\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the theoretical and empirical per-\nspectives from the OCA literature. Section III examines the suitability of ASEAN for adoption of a\ncommon currency and Section IV assesses the key constraints on such adoption. Section V con-\ncludes by placing the issue in a broader global perspective.\n\n1\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 12\nCOSTS AND BENEFITS OF A COMMON CURRENCY FOR ASEAN\n\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:6)(cid:13)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:10)(cid:5)(cid:1)(cid:14)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:3)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:5)(cid:1)(cid:15)(cid:9)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:9)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:10)(cid:16)(cid:3)(cid:17)(cid:6)(cid:12)(cid:17)\n\nAccording to the OCA literature, the key economic cost from formation of a currency union\nby a group of countries is the loss of national autonomy in monetary policy. Under a currency\nunion, there is no scope for independent monetary policies by the member countries of the union.\nHowever, the cost associated with the loss of monetary independence depends upon how well the\nindividual countries were conducting monetary policy prior to joining the currency union.\n\nMany developing countries with open capital accounts have several constraints in the ef-\nfective conduct of an independent monetary policy. This is especially so in developing countries\nwith thin capital markets and weak central banking institutions. In general, the record of develop-\ning countries in conducting independent national monetary policies to minimize cyclical fluctua-\ntions in economic activity has been somewhat patchy. This suggests that the economic loss from\ngiving up an independent monetary policy may not be very large for such countries. On the con-\ntrary, a currency union may, in fact, elicit commitment to greater macroeconomic stability from\ncountries  that  otherwise  have  a  mixed  track  record  in  implementing  monetary  policy  prior  to\njoining the currency union (Barro 2001). It is possible that this benefit will compensate for the loss\nof monetary policy autonomy.\n\nThe major benefit of a common currency that has been emphasized is that it facilitates\ntrade (in both goods and services) and investment among the countries of the union (and hence\nincreases income growth within the region) by reducing transaction costs in cross-border business,\nand removing volatility in exchange rates across the union. A currency is like language (Barro\n2001). As a common language facilitates effective communication among people, a common cur-\nrency could promote trade and investment among countries. In an environment of different cur-\nrencies, transaction costs, including the costs of obtaining information about prices, would be higher.\nThis would be a disincentive to trade, commerce, and investment.\n\nMoreover, under floating exchange rate regimes\u2014the alternative to a fixed exchange rate\nregime\u2014exchange rates tend to be more volatile than is warranted by the economic fundamentals\nof an economy (Rose 1994, Williamson 1999, Bergsten and Henning 1996, Collignon 1999). This is\nespecially  true  of  small  developing  economies  with  thin  capital  markets.  Developing  countries\nwith large unhedged foreign currency liabilities (original sin), therefore, often \u201cfear to float.\u201d Mon-\netary policies in such countries tend to be pro-cyclical rather than counter-cyclical. Belying the\nexpectations of advocates of floating exchange rate regimes, flexible exchange rates have often\nbecome  a  source  of  shocks  rather  than  shock  absorbers.  \u201cMarket  errors\u201d  and  the  consequent\nmisalignments in exchange rates under floating exchange rate regimes have been substantial (Breur\n1994). Disproportionate volatility in exchange rates increases uncertainty, discourages trade, di-\nminishes investment, and reduces overall economic growth (Kenen and Rodrik 1986, Huizinga\n1994,  Corbo  and  Cox  1995).  It  is  possible  to  mitigate  some  of  these  adverse  effects  of  floating\nexchange rates by hedging against exchange rate fluctuations. However, hedging involves non-\nnegligible transaction costs (Adler 1996, Friberg 1996, Rajan 2000). Development of perfect hedg-\ning instruments may even be difficult in practice. This may explain why in a 1992 survey of nonfi-\n\n2\n\n\fSection II\nPerspectives on Optimum Currency Area\n\nnancial Fortune companies, while 85 percent of the respondents hedged, only 22 percent hedged\nfully (Rajan 2000).\n\nA common currency could mitigate some of these adverse effects of a floating exchange rate\nsystem. From a purely economic point of view, a set of countries should opt for a common currency\nif the cost of losing national autonomy in monetary policy is mitigated by the benefits of a currency\nunion. While it is difficult to quantify these costs and benefits, the OCA literature offers some\nguidelines to compare them. The benefits of a currency union increase and/or the costs decrease\nwith (i) greater flexibility in wages and prices among the countries of the union, (ii) greater mobil-\nity of factors of production (labor and capital) across countries, (iii) more symmetric shocks across\ncountries, (iv) more openness among the economies within the union, and (iv) larger share of trade\namong the countries of the region.\n\nA composite index of some of these determinants of the relative costs and benefits of a\ncurrency union, known as the OCA index, has been used to assess the suitability of a set of coun-\ntries  for  adoption  of  a  common  currency.  These  OCA  indicators  should,  however,  be  used  with\ncaution  because  they  are  not  necessarily  independent  of  the  prevailing  exchange  rate  regime\n(Eichengreen 1996, Frankel and Rose 1997, Rose 2000, Glick and Rose 2001). The OCA indicators,\nin other words, could be endogenous to the exchange rate regime. Endogeneity of the OCA indica-\ntors can arise due to a variety of reasons. Two of these deserve special mention.\n\nFirst, to the extent that a common currency promotes greater trade among countries, open-\nness and the volume of intra-union trade will be greater under a common currency than under a\nregime of floating exchange rates. This will make the degree of openness and the volume of intra-\nunion trade endogenous to the exchange rate regime. Early estimates of the effect of exchange rate\nregimes on trade were generally small and modest at best (Kennen and Rodrik 1986, Huizinga\n1994,  Corbo  and  Cox  1995).  However,  more  recent  studies  find  substantial  positive  effect  of  a\ncommon currency regime on trade (Rose 2000, Glick and Rose 2001, and Rose and Wincoop 2001).\nSecond, the degree of flexibility of wages in the labor markets and the prices in the product\nmarkets are likely to be larger under a credible currency union than under a floating exchange\nrate regime. This is a broader application of the well-known Lucas principle that states that the\nvery structure of an economy may be affected by changes in the policy regime. This is not to sug-\ngest that wages and prices will become perfectly flexible once exchange rates across countries are\nlocked in, but that wage and price setters will adapt in order to avoid increases in unemployment\nto levels that would provoke resistance to continued participation in the currency union (Eichengreen\n1996). Historical evidence tends to support such a market response. For example, the response of\nlabor and product market prices to shocks was found to be faster under the gold standard than\nunder  monetary  regimes  characterized  by  greater  exchange  rate  variability  (Bayoumi  and\nEichengreen 1996).\n\n3\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 12\nCOSTS AND BENEFITS OF A COMMON CURRENCY FOR ASEAN\n\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:5)(cid:18)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:9)(cid:1)(cid:5)(cid:17)(cid:19)(cid:1)(cid:20)(cid:1)(cid:5)(cid:16)(cid:3)(cid:7)(cid:21)(cid:3)(cid:17)(cid:13)(cid:12)(cid:17)(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:3)(cid:17)(cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:7)(cid:15)(cid:15)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:9)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:10)(cid:16)\n\nIs ASEAN suitable for adopting a common currency? While it is difficult to quantify the\ncosts and benefits, applying the guidelines of the OCA literature shows there are several charac-\nteristics of the ASEAN that suggest that the benefits of a common currency may be significant\nrelative to the costs.\n\nIn terms of the cost of giving up independent monetary policy, in practice, given the some-\nwhat mixed track record of many of these countries in conducting monetary policy, the costs of\nsurrendering monetary autonomy are unlikely to be large: At least some of them may perhaps be\ngiving up something that they do not have!  In fact, as a result of forming a currency union, there\nis a possibility that some of the countries that now have a patchy track record of inflation control\nand exchange rate management could benefit substantially from a monetary policy conducted by a\nmore credible regional central bank. Such a convergence to best (or better) practices in monetary\npolicy in the region will be a benefit, not a cost.\n\nIn terms of factor mobility, ASEAN compares favorably with the European Union (EU) at\nthe time of the Maastricht Treaty. ASEAN has relatively high labor mobility as well as capital\nmobility (Goto and Hamada 1994; Eichengreen and Bayoumi 1999; Moon, Rhee, and Yoon 2000).\nFor example, workers from Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand account for 10 percent\nof the employment in Singapore. Emigration has been as much as 2 percent of the labor force of the\nsending countries.\n\nCompared to the EU, ASEAN also ranks quite high in terms of wage and price flexibility.\nIn fact, traditionally they are known for their flexibility and speed of adjustment to shocks. Accord-\ning to Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1994), almost all of the change in output and prices in response\nto a shock in East Asia takes place in about two years. By comparison, in Europe, only about half\nthe adjustment occurs in the first two years after a shock. These results are consistent with the\ngeneral impression that labor markets are more flexible in ASEAN than in Western Europe.\n\nMany ASEAN countries have trade-to-GDP ratios as well as trade-intensity ratios (which\nnormalize bilateral trade by the relative share of the countries in total world trade to eliminate\nsize effects) that are higher than in Western Europe (Goto and Hamada 1994, Kawai and Takagi\n2000). At close to 25 percent, the share of intraregional trade in ASEAN total trade, although\nlower than in the EU (40 percent), is significant and rising (Bayoumi and Mauro 1999). It is much\nhigher than in some of the other currency unions such as the Eastern Carribean Currency Union\n(about 10 percent), the Western Africa Economic and Monetary Union (about 10 percent), and the\nCentral African Economic and Monetary Community (about 3 percent).\n\nAlthough there are intercountry differences, the symmetry in shocks among the countries\nin the region is comparable to the EU (Eichengreen and Bayoumi 1999). The regionwide economic\nslowdown in 2001 in response to the global economic downturn is another evidence of the high\ndegree of shock symmetry among these countries. The high degree of shock symmetry reflects both\nthe high degree of openness (export orientation, capital flows etc.) and the similarities in the pro-\nduction structures among these economies.\n\n4\n\n\fSection IV\nConstraints on the Adoption of a Common Currency\n\nOverall, composite OCA indices for the region, which take into account intraregional trade,\nwage-price  flexibility,  labor  mobility,  and  shock  symmetry,  are  similar  to  those  for  the  EU\n(Eichengreen and Bayoumi 1999). Using a variety of indicators drawn from the OCA literature,\nEichengreen and Bayoumi conclude that from a purely economic perspective, East Asia/ASEAN is\nas suitable for an OCA as Europe was prior to the Maastricht Treaty.\n\n(cid:1)(cid:14)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:13)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:17)(cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:13)(cid:3)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:5)(cid:18)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:17)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:5)(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:7)(cid:21)(cid:3)(cid:17)(cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:7)(cid:15)(cid:15)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:9)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:10)(cid:16)\n\nNone of the empirical evidences presented above should make one disregard some of the\nkey constraints on locking in the exchange rates and adopting a common currency over the long\nrun. Sustaining a common currency may be even more difficult than adopting it. Four constraints\nthat have generally been mentioned in discussions are worth special attention: (i) diversity in the\nlevel of economic development across countries, (ii) weaknesses in the financial sectors of many\ncountries, (iii) inadequacy of region-level resource pooling mechanisms and institutions required\nfor forming and managing a currency union, and (iv) lack of political preconditions for monetary\ncooperation and a common currency.\n\nThe diversity in the level of economic development among the ASEAN countries is quite\nlarge. Singapore, the richest country in the group, has a per capita income close to 300 times the\nper  capita  income  of  Myanmar,  the  poorest  country  in  the  group.  Even  among  the  ASEAN\u20135\n(Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand), the per capita income of Singapore is\nabout 40 times the per capita income of Indonesia. This degree of diversity is higher than among\nthe countries of the EU. It is sometimes argued that such a high degree of income differentials\ncould make it difficult to sustain a monetary union among these countries. However, it is impor-\ntant to note that what is important for the adoption of a common currency among countries is that\nrelative prices and outputs across them should have high co-movements following an economic\nshock, not so much that the levels of income should be more equal across them. For even if the\ncountries in a monetary union have perfect equality of per capita incomes, if the co-movement of\nrelative prices and outputs across countries is low, conducting a common monetary policy for the\nunion as a whole is difficult. On the other hand, even if per capita incomes across countries in a\nmonetary union are vastly different, but their co-movement following an economic shock is very\nhigh, conducting a common monetary policy is much less problematic. Income differentials across\ncountries could pose a constraint to the conduct of a common monetary policy only to the extent\nthat they reflect the dissimilarities in the production structures across countries (and hence move-\nments in relative prices and outputs across them). However, it is important  to note that some of\nthe populous countries in the world, e.g., People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), India, Indonesia, or\nUnited States, also exhibit large intraregional income differentials within them. Yet, each of these\ncountries uses a single currency.\n\nIf countries with diverse subregions can adopt a common currency, why not a region with\ndiverse countries? The answer perhaps lies in the fact that (i) labor and capital are freely mobile\n\n5\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 12\nCOSTS AND BENEFITS OF A COMMON CURRENCY FOR ASEAN\n\nwithin a country (although formal labor mobility across subregions in the PRC are constrained by\nofficial restrictions), but are not necessarily so across countries; and (ii) the budget and fiscal policy\ncan, within limits, be used to bring about inter-regional resource transfers within a country, an-\nother adjustment mechanism that is often difficult to operate across countries. To manage a cur-\nrency union for a group of countries with a large difference in level of development, it is, therefore,\nimportant to allow a freer flow of capital and labor across borders. This is an area that would need\nconcerted efforts by the ASEAN governments.  Member countries will have to evolve policies and\nmechanisms that would allow greater mobility of both capital and labor across national borders, in\naddition  to  the  freer  movement  of  goods  allowed  under  the  free  trade  arrangement  within  the\nregion.\n\nAs for fiscal policy, it is difficult to have a large centralized budget at the union level to\nmake  resource  transfers  across  countries.  The  greater  mobility  of  factors  of  production  should\nreduce the need for large fiscal transfers over the medium to long term. However, in the short run\nlabor mobility cannot be relied upon to take care of asymmetric shocks across countries in a cur-\nrency union. Country-specific fiscal policies can be used to respond to asymmetric shocks across\ncountries within the union. However, the scope for country-specific discretionary fiscal policies\nwithin a currency union would be limited if there is a ceiling on fiscal imbalances, as is the case in\nthe European Union under the Stability and Growth Pact. Since historically fiscal irresponsibility\nhas  proven  to  be  the  waterloo  of  monetary  cooperation  many  times,  it  is  perhaps  desirable  to\nrestrict fiscal autonomy within a currency union by using mechanisms similar to the European\nUnion\u2019s  Stability  and  Growth  Pact,  but  with  greater  flexibility  at  the  national  level.  One  such\noption could be to allow automatic fiscal stabilizers at the national levels to move the fiscal balance\nin a counter-cyclical fashion (worsening during economic downturns and improving during eco-\nnomic upturns) but within certain broad limits.\n\nOne of the lessons from some of the emerging market financial crises is that when coun-\ntries with weak banking and financial sectors and heavy dependence on foreign capital peg their\nexchange rates, banking problems could turn into an exchange rate crisis (Eichengreen and Bayoumi\n1999). A weak banking system could, therefore, undermine an exchange rate regime such as a\ncommon currency arrangement. Historically, banking problems have not been as pervasive among\nthe ASEAN countries as in other emerging market economies. Yet, the 1997 financial crisis in Asia\nhas exposed the fragility of the banking systems and the financial sectors of many countries in the\nregion. Despite the progress in financial sector restructuring in the aftermath of the crisis, the\nremaining agenda of banking reforms is quite large. Significant further reforms and restructuring\nof the financial sectors and the banking systems will, therefore, be required among the ASEAN\ncountries before they could adopt a common currency. There is, however, a positive side to this\nchallenge. A currency union among these countries, accompanied by a regional integration of fi-\nnancial services, could enable countries with stronger banking systems to specialize in the provi-\nsion of these services at the regional level. That would lead to greater harmonization of banking\nand financial sector practices across countries as well as raise the overall banking and financial\nsector standards across the region.\n\n6\n\n\fSection V\nConclusion\n\nInadequate  mechanisms  for  regional  reserve  pooling  as  well  as  the  absence  of  regional\ninstitutions could be another set of constraints on monetary cooperation and common currency\namong the East Asian countries. The reserve sharing arrangements under the Chiang Mai Initia-\ntive constitute a modest beginning in addressing this constraint. Yet, a common currency for the\nregion would require much greater reserve pooling and sharing among the countries than is cur-\nrently possible under the Chiang Mai Initiative. Europe established a whole gamut of institutions\nsuch as the European Council, European Commission, and European Central Bank to manage\nregional resource sharing and to coordinate the monetary union. It took decades of experimenta-\ntion in Europe to establish these institutions. Given the almost total absence of institutions to\nsupport regional monetary cooperation in East Asia, developing the regional institutions to man-\nage a common currency is likely to be a major challenge.  Once again, there is a positive side to this\nchallenge: the region can benefit from decades of European experience. It can \u201cleapfrog\u201d in devel-\noping the regional reserve sharing mechanisms and the institutions, if there is enough political\nsupport for a regional currency union. That brings one to another key constraint: lack of political\npreconditions for a currency union in the ASEAN.\n\nIt is argued that while East Asia or the ASEAN may satisfy the economic requirements for\nan OCA as much as the EU does, it has not developed the political preconditions necessary for a\ncommon currency (Eichengren and Bayoumi 1999; Bayoumi, Eichengreen, and Mauro 2000).   In\nEurope, the debate over monetary integration has gone hand in hand with discussions of political\nintegration and creation of a supranational entity empowered to override sovereign national gov-\nernments. At each stage of this political integration, national governments delegated a growing\nrange of powers to the collectivity. Going by the European experience, developing political support\nand the institutions required for a currency union in the region, whether it is among ASEAN or\namong a broader group of countries, is likely to be a formidable challenge. One should not under-\nstate the difficulties of addressing this challenge. Yet, if the economic advantages of a regional\nmonetary union are large, it is possible that countries may make political compromises so as to\nreap the economic benefits (Park 2001). Economic interests may persuade countries to set aside\npolitical differences and forge strategically beneficial political alliances. In other words, political\nsupport may not be exogenous to the economic outcomes, just as economic outcomes may not be\nindependent of political factors. Economic and political integration in the region may, therefore, be\na joint although gradual process spanning perhaps decades.\n\n(cid:14)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:10)(cid:20)(cid:9)(cid:13)(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:4)\n\nThe issue of the costs and benefits of a common currency for the ASEAN needs to be placed\nin  a  somewhat  global  perspective.  As  Barro  (2001)  observes,  three  sets  of  factors  are  likely  to\nencourage the initiation of currency unions across the globe in the future: (i) the increasing num-\nber of countries in the world; (ii) globalization; and (iii) the diminishing role of independent na-\ntional monetary policies, especially for small countries.\n\n7\n\n\fERD Working Paper No. 12\nCOSTS AND BENEFITS OF A COMMON CURRENCY FOR ASEAN\n\nAt the end of World War II, there were 76 independent countries in the world. Today there\nare nearly 200. For many of the growing number of smaller countries, the costs of maintaining\nseparate currencies and floating exchange rates are likely to be very high. For them, therefore, the\nnet benefits from joining a monetary union (or simply using another country\u2019s currency) are likely\nto  be  significant  (Barro  2001).  This  could  encourage  the  formation  of  an  increasing  number  of\ncurrency unions over time.\n\nThe increased pace of globalization (including the spread of trade in goods and services and\nfinancial transactions and the heightened diffusion of technology) is also likely to encourage the\nformation of currency unions. In an increasingly globalizing world, there is likely to be greater\nsynchronization of business cycles across countries, and hence the net benefits of having fewer\ncurrencies to conduct cross-border business are likely to be larger. Moreover, as the world gets\nmore integrated, the volume of transactions involving citizens of different countries will increase.\nAs international transactions become a larger share of total global transactions, the attractiveness\nof common currencies relative to a multitude of sovereign currencies is likely to increase.\n\nThe benefit that economists and central bankers attribute to national monetary policies is\nalso diminishing. There is growing skepticism about the usefulness of independent monetary poli-\ncies, especially to smaller developing economies, for counter-cyclical stabilization purposes.\n\nAll these factors have the potential to increase political support for monetary and economic\nintegration across countries. Overall, therefore, events may become more favorable to the forma-\ntion of currency unions. Should the ASEAN be part of this likely global trend?  It is time to ponder\nthis question, even if one does not foresee a conclusive answer in the immediate future. For in case\nthe answer turns out to be \u201cyes\u201d, the challenges of forming an ASEAN currency union (or other\nregional groupings in Asia), including managing the transition phases, are likely to be formidable.\nThe preparatory groundwork itself would involve considerable effort.\n\nGoing by international experience, the time required to complete the process is unlikely to\nbe short either. Europe spent several decades in experimenting with regional monetary coopera-\ntion before adopting a monetary union. The task may be even more challenging for ASEAN. But it\nis important not to underestimate the Southeast Asian capacity for \u201ctime compression.\u201d During\nthe last few decades, time and again, these countries have turned in economic achievements at an\nunprecedented speed. That record of achievement earned some of them the coveted title of miracle\neconomies.\n\nDespite the Asian crisis, the achievement of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) in early\n2002, much in advance of the original deadline of 2008, is yet another pointer to their capacity for\n\u201ctime compression.\u201d With the launching of the AFTA, ASEAN countries have crossed an important\nmilestone: moving closer to what some would refer to as the \u201cgood neighbors\u2019 stage\u201d of regionalism,\nin which participating countries abolish trade barriers and create a level playing field for cross-\nborder movement of goods, services, and capital, but allow the pursuit of separate national eco-\nnomic agendas in other areas, especially in the areas of fiscal and monetary policies.\n\nIt is certainly a very challenging task for the ASEAN to move from the \u201cgood neighbors\u2019\nstage\u201d to the European \u201chappy family stage\u201d of regionalism, in which participating countries also\n\n8\n\n\fReferences\n\nshare a common currency; free flow of people across borders; and common institutions, both eco-\nnomic and political, which are required to manage the common currency. But, as is well known,\nregional monetary integration, by its very nature, is a long process involving a series of small,\nincremental, steps over time. Viewed from this perspective, the launching of the AFTA and the\nregional resource sharing arrangements under the Chiang Mai Initiative may perhaps possess the\npotential to gradually lead to greater regional monetary cooperation. Moreover, the ASEAN coun-\ntries have the European experience behind them, and that could be an added advantage.\n\n(cid:6)(cid:12)(cid:21)(cid:12)(cid:6)(cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:13)\n\nAdler, M., 1996. \u201cExchange Rate Planning for International Trading Firm.\u201d In Y.
