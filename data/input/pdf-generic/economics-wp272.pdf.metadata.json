Introduction \nThere is widespread agreement among economists that foreign direct investment (FDI) \nperforms a critical function in the current process of globalization; it is frequently proposed \nto be beneficial for both the host and home countries.1 The existing literature suggests \nthat FDI brings a number of beneficial effects to host countries: (i) technology spillover \neffects, (ii) backward and forward linkage effects, (iii) trade effects, (iv) competitive \nand anticompetitive effects, and (v) growth/development effects. This paper focuses \nspecifically on the productivity spillover effects of FDI flows. \nThe effect of FDI on a host economy\u2019s productivity has become a matter of great \ninterest, and remains a contentious issue. Foreign investment is often purported to raise \nthe productivity of the receiving firm or firms in their geographical proximity. Moreover, \nthere is also a question as to whether FDI makes an investing firm more productive by \nproviding it with access to superior technology.2 Considering these direct implications, it is \nunsurprising that FDI has gained attention among international economists. \nHowever, the extensive attention afforded to the topic thus far has produced few empirical \nstudies explaining the effects of FDI with technology spillover in the context of South\u2013\nSouth FDI flows. In fact, a growing body of literature focuses on either North\u2013North or \nNorth\u2013South FDI flows. This gap in the literature leaves crucial questions unaddressed, \nfor example: To what extent can the role of FDI flows in spillovers be determined, and \ncan the unique characteristics of South\u2013South FDI flows be distinguished?\nNoting the effects of South\u2013South FDI on host countries can prove useful for several \nreasons. First, statistics confirm the growing importance of South\u2013South FDI. According \nto the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development\u2019s World Investment Reports \n(UNCTAD 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2008), FDI inflows from developing economies reached \ntheir highest point in 2007, and the majority of these investments have contributed to \neconomic growth in host countries. Second, FDI from South countries follows a different \n1  The World Bank (1993) notes that FDI brings considerable benefits: technology transfer, management know-how, \nand export marketing access. Many developing countries will need to become more effective in attracting FDI \nflows if they are to close the technology gap with high-income countries, upgrade their managerial skills, and \ndevelop their export markets. \n2  FDI has long been considered an important channel for technology diffusion. After all, FDI theory holds that firm-\nspecific technology is transferred across international borders by sharing technology among multinational parent \ncompanies. However, it is difficult to summarize the existing evidence on the importance of FDI for international \ntechnology spillover. This is, because first, it frequently derives from irreconcilable modes of analysis. Second, even \nfor a particular type of analysis, key results are currently in process. See Keller and Yeaple (2003) for details. ", "2 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 272\npattern compared to the pattern associated with FDI from North countries. For example, \nSouth\u2013South FDI might be more resistant to economic crises than North\u2013South FDI in \nhost countries. Moreover, as multinational enterprises (MNEs) from the South generally \nprefer local hires, South\u2013South FDI provides a flexible countermeasure against political \nand economic conditions in host countries, in addition to lower overhead costs (Wells \n1983). Third, the growing importance of South\u2013South FDI indicates that the government\u2019s \nattempts to attract FDI should also focus on inflows to the South. This would constitute a \nsignificant change in the political implications of FDI. \nThis paper explicitly links the analysis of FDI to a core question in international trade: the \nrole of FDI in technology spillover and growth particularly in three contexts: North\u2013North, \nNorth\u2013South, and South\u2013South FDI flows. This study consists of: (i) a discussion of how \nFDI flows spill over and contribute to growth in general, particularly in the case of South\u2013\nSouth FDI flows, and (ii) a comparative study of empirical analyses of FDI spillovers and \ngrowth. Particular attention is paid to South\u2013South flows involving Asia. \nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we conduct an overview of existing \nstudies. In Section III, we explain FDI flows and characteristics in three types of FDI: \nNorth\u2013North, North\u2013South, and South\u2013South FDI flow. Then, we provide a general \ndescription of the data we employed in Section IV. This section also explains how we \ncan obtain data. In Section V, we assess the role of FDI in technology spillover, providing \nempirical models to estimate the effects of FDI. Section VI comprises a final summary \nand our conclusions. \nII.  Literature Review\nThe channel of international technology diffusion can be classified broadly into two \ncategories, trade and FDI. Trade has been focused on as a major source of technology \nspillover for a long time. The routine of absorbing technology can be either imports or \nexports. However, a few researchers have found exports to be a path for technology \ntransfer. This is because most studies were unable to find clear-cut evidence of so-called \n\u201clearning-by-exporting\u201d effects (Clerides, Lach, and Tybout 1998; Bernard and Jensen \n1999; Hallward-Driemeir, Iarossi, and Sokoloff 2002).\nOn the other hand, a number of papers have shown that imports can be a crucial channel \nfor technology diffusion. Eaton and Kortum (2001 and 2002) established a structure of \ntechnology diffusion based on the Ricardian model. In Eaton and Kortum\u2019s model, trade \nprovides access to foreign technologies as well as goods by augmenting the production \npossibility frontier. However, their model includes no technology spillover, as importers \nalready pay a competitive price for the technologies embedded in foreign goods. Coe \nand Helpman (1995) employed R&D spillover regressions and determined that foreign ", "Foreign Direct Investment, Technology Diffusion, and Host Country Productivity Growth | 3\nR&D activities augment the TFP of host countries. Pursuant to Keller\u2019s finding (1998) \nthat a randomly generated R&D variable can readily replace the actual one, a number \nof authors have further developed international R&D spillover regressions. Some have \ncommented on the role of capital goods trade (Xu and Wang 1999), as opposed to overall \ntrade as in Coe and Helpman\u2019s study, but others have captured the indirect R&D spillover \neffects (Lumenga-Neso, Olarreaga, and Schiff 2001). To summarize, there is plenty of \nconvincing evidence of technology spillover though trade, but the existing literature also \nleaves some questions open.\nStudies on the economic effects of FDI often concentrate on the host economy, \nparticularly on improvements in productivity. They assume that FDI has positive effects \non productivity, not merely because it is a source of capital, but also because it is an \nimportant source of human capital augmentation, technology change, and spillovers of \nideas across countries through MNEs (Grossman and Helpman 1995). There are two \nprincipal reasons underlying this argument. First, when MNEs invest in host countries, \nthey bring with them advanced intangible assets that comprise their specific advantage \nand provide them with the power to compete successfully with local firms that have \nsuperior information on local markets, consumer preferences, and local business \npractices. Thus, advanced intangible assets allow higher productivity to MNEs, thus \noutweighing the disadvantages they face in the domestic markets of host countries. \nSecond, the entry of MNEs disrupts the existing equilibrium and eliminates the \nmonopolistic power of local firms in order to protect and maintain their market share. \nOn the other hand, through direct contact with MNEs, local firms observe and imitate \nthe operational protocols of MNEs. This suggests that competition, demonstration, and \nlearning by doing among MNEs and local firms may lead to increases in productivity \n(Buckly and Casson 1976; Hymer 1976; Dunning 1993; Blomstr\u00f6m and Kokko 1996; \nCaves 1996). Owing to these effects, many countries offer special incentives to foreign \nenterprises, including lower income taxes or income tax holidays, as well as import duty \nexemptions.\nIn theory, MNEs contribute to (i) improving efficiency and enhancing growth by breaking \nbottlenecks to investment, although this effect may become less important as the \ntechnology of the host country advances; (ii) introducing and applying new know-how by \ndemonstrating new products production, marketing techniques (demonstration effects), \nand the training workers who later take employment in local firms, thus decreasing \ntraining cost (training effects); (iii) transferring techniques for inventory and quality control \nand standardization to their local suppliers and distribution channels; and (iv) forcing \nlocal firms to increase their managerial efforts, or to adopting some of the marketing \ntechniques used by MNEs, either on the local market or internationally.\nEmpirical studies conducted thus far into the relevant effects of FDI on output or \nproductivity have not been able to provide a definite conclusion, however, as results ", "4 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 272\nvary depending on samples and econometric methodologies.3 At the same time, these \nmixed empirical findings have raised another contentious issue with regard to whether a \nhost government\u2019s provision of favorable benefits to induce FDI is justifiable. Aitken and \nHarrison (1999) determined that FDI negatively affects the productivity of domestically \nowned plants in Venezuela. Haddad and Harrison (1993) and Djankov and Hoekman \n(2000) detected no significant effects of foreign presence on the rate of productivity of \nlocal firms, i.e., there are no spillover effects. On the other hand, Haskel, Pereira, and \nSlaughter (2007) and G\u00f6rg and Strobl (2002) found positive spillovers from foreign to \nlocal firms in the United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland, respectively. Additionally, studies by \nCaves (1974), Blomstr\u00f6m and Wolff (1994), and Haskel, Pereira, and Slaughter (2007) \ndemonstrate that foreign presence, in terms of the foreign share of employment or value \nadded, tends to increase labor productivity among local firms.\nFurther, only a few empirical studies have considered the different effects of FDI spillover \nby different home countries. If technology spillover by FDI is the result of advanced \nintangible assets, these spillover effects might also rely on the differing characteristics of \nhome countries. Moreover, other previous studies have focused solely on the US as a \nhost country, and thus yield ungeneralizable findings. Therefore, FDI spillover effects will \nvary depending on the host and home countries; this is the principal hypothesis of this \npaper. \nSince it is impossible to consider every single case to analyze FDI spillovers, it is \nnecessary to categorize the type of host and home country. The countries are grouped \ninto North versus South according to the income level of each country. In our study, we \ngroup OECD countries into the North and non-OECD countries into the South. In such \na fashion, we are able to distinguish the type of FDI into three categories: North\u2013North, \nNorth\u2013South, and South\u2013South FDI. In this paper, we explicitly differentiate the effects of \nFDI in three different categories. In particular, we focus on South\u2013South FDI flows. \nThe technology transfer associated with North\u2013North FDI flows in two directions. \nThe first involves MNEs subsidiaries diffusing technologies to domestic firms in host \ncountries (inward FDI technology transfer), and the other involves MNEs subsidiaries \nbenefiting from local firms in the host country (outward FDI technology sourcing). Many \nresearchers focus on comparisons between inward and outward FDI (Globerman, Kokko, \nand Sj\u00f6holm 2000; Branstetter 2001; van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie and Lichtenberg \n2001; Singh 2003). Branstetter (2001) found evidence to suggest that both types of \nFDI spillover effects exist, whereas Globerman, Kokko, and Sj\u00f6holm (2000) found only \nevidence for the outward FDI effect. Singh (2003) and van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie \nand Lichtenberg (2001) have argued that the technology sourcing effect is much stronger \nthan the technology transfer effect, using a sample of 10 countries of the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD). \n3  See Barba Navaretti and Venables (2004) and G\u00f6rg and Greenway (2004) for  surveys of spillover channels and \nempirical findings.", "Foreign Direct Investment, Technology Diffusion, and Host Country Productivity Growth | 5\nOther studies strictly cover technology sourcing practices, usually with a focus on the \nabsorption of technologies from highly developed countries. The representative case is \nJapanese FDI in the United States (US) and Europe (Kogut and Chang 1991, Yamawaki \n1993, Branstetter 2001). It turns out that Japanese firms enter the US and Europe market \nby establishing joint ventures with local firms if they have technological disadvantages. \nOn the other hand, when Japanese firms have technological disadvantages relative to the \nUS and Europe, they tend to build up new plants.\nThe spillover effects of North\u2013South FDI are quite plausible, as a number of studies \nagree that less productive firms benefit more from foreign technology (Girma and Wakelin \n2001; Griffith, Redding, and Simpson 2003; Haskel, Pereira, and Slaughter 2007). Inward \nFDI in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) is the center of research attention (Coe, \nHelpman, and Hoffmaister 1997; Li, Liu, and Parker 2001; Liu et al. 2001; Wei and Liu \n2001; Buckley, Clegg, and Wang 2002; Hu and Jefferson 2002; Liu 2002; Huang 2004). \nThe common factor in these studies is that the absorption capacity of the host country \nperforms a critical role in the efficacy of FDI spillover. This underlines the importance \nof human capital accumulation in the host country (Eaton and Kortum 1996; Xu 2000; \nCaselli and Coleman 2001). \nMost studies into this general field of inquiry focus on North\u2013North or North\u2013South flows. \nHowever, research into South\u2013South FDI spillover is quite rare. The closest study to \nthis one is the study conducted by Schiff and Wang (2008). They estimated the effect of \ntrade-related R&D on technology diffusion in North\u2013South and South\u2013South patterns of \ntrade. They concluded that the magnitude and velocity of technology diffusion in the host \ncountry was much better via the North\u2013South direction than through South\u2013South trade. \nHowever, this research did not cover the role of FDI in technology spillover. As far as we \nknow, no literature has addressed South\u2013South FDI spillover, although FDI flow between \ncountries considered to belong to the South is increasing steadily. Moreover, due to rapid \neconomic integration and the construction of global networks in Asia, the magnitude of \nSouth\u2013South FDI flows is expected to become increasingly larger. Therefore, South\u2013\nSouth FDI should be also considered as well as North\u2013North and North\u2013South FDI \nin terms of its growing concern and importance. The type of technology spillover is \nsummarized in Table 1.", "6 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 272\nTable 1: Summary of Literature\nHost Country\nNorth South\nHome  North \u2022 Expected Technology Spillover Channel: \u2022 Expected Technology Spillover Channel:\ncountry   \u2013  Importing intermediate inputs     \u2013  Importing intermediate inputs \n  \u2013  Learning by doing   \u2013  Learning externalities\n  \u2013  Inward technology transfer   \u2013  Human capital accumulation  \n  \u2013  Outward FDI sourcing    \u2013  R&D spillover  \n\u2022 Existing Studies:  \u2022 Existing Studies:\n  \u2013 Clerides, Lach, and Tybout (1998)   \u2013 Coe and Helpman (1995) \n  There is no significant effect from past    Foreign R&D activities augment total factor \nexporting experience on reducing current  productivity of host countries through trade.\ncost.   \u2013 Coe, Helpman, and Hoffmaister (1997)\n  \u2013 Branstetter (2001)    Developing countries benefit more from \n  By the investigation of Japanese FDI in  foreign technology if the transfer is \nthe US, they found that both types of FDI  processed by a more skilled labor force.\nspillover exists.   \u2013 Liu et al.

Pattern of FDI Flows: An Initial Look\nThis section examines stylized trends of FDI flows in North\u2013North, North\u2013South, and \nSouth\u2013South. Some OECD countries4 such as France, Germany, and the US comprise \nthe North countries5 while all non-North countries comprise the South. We use FDI data \nfrom the OECD FDI Statistics and UNCTAD FDI dataset. Hence, we can obtain only \nNorth\u2013North and North\u2013South FDI data, because of existing bilateral FDI data between \nOECD member countries and the world countries in OECD. We obtained South\u2013\nSouth FDI data via mergers with the UNCTAD FDI dataset. We also classify the Asian \ncountries6 in order to identify key trends of FDI flows in this region (see Appendix).\nFigure 1 shows FDI flows for the world from 1985. World FDI stepped up considerably in \nthe middle of the 1980s; from that time on, FDI continued to grow in the 2000s. The early \n2000s and recent years have been the only exception to the general increases, as the \ninformation technology bubble collapsed and the world economy became embroiled in the \nfinancial crisis. Note that the PRC and other Asian countries have taken the lead in recent \nFDI flows.\n4  According to OECD.Stat, the OECD countries are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, \nEstonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, \nLuxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, \nSweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the UK, and the US.\n5  In this paper, the North countries are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, \nGreece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, \nSwitzerland, the UK, and the US.\n6  In this paper, the (developing) Asian countries are Bangladesh; the PRC; Hong Kong, China; India; Indonesia; the \nRepublic of Korea; Malaysia; Pakistan; the Philippines; Singapore; Sri Lanka; Thailand; and Viet Nam.", "8 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 272\nFigure 1: World FDI Flows (US$ billion) \n \n2,500 20,000\n2,000 16,000\n1,500 12,000\nw S\no to\nFl ck\n1,000 8,000\n500 4,000\n0 0\n1985 87 89 91 93 95 97 99 2001 03 05 07 09\nInward_Flow Outward_Flow\nInward_Stock Outward_Stock\nSource:  Authors' calculations based on the UNCTADSTAT. http://unctadstat.unctad.org/ReportFolders/reportFolders.aspx\nFigure 2 illustrates FDI flows by income level of home and host countries. Each quadrant \nshows a different source and recipient country. For example, the first quadrant represents \nFDI flows from North to North countries. As anticipated, it turns out that North countries \nhave a large share of FDI into their own countries (North countries). Table 2 shows \nthe share of FDI across North countries from 1985 to 2008. In all years, both inward \nand outward FDI between North countries accounted for up to 70% of the total. This is \nquite consistent with the existing literature. That is, a number of influential papers have \nsuggested that the bulk of FDI is essentially horizontal direct investment among countries \nwith similar per capita incomes or similar relative factor endowments. In other words, \nmarket-seeking FDI pattern is the dominant variety (see Markusen 1995 and Brainard \n1993).7 Also, it is worth noting that the US, Belgium, and the UK have ranked the highest \namong source and recipient countries by investing in other North countries. In terms of \nsize, those three countries\u2019 pivotal role is hardly comparable to that of other countries \n(see Figure 3). \n7  Markusen (1995) reports that in 1985, developed countries were the source of 97% of direct investment flows and \nthe recipient of 75%.  He also notes that the share of all direct investment outflows generated by G-5 countries \nabsorbed by other G-5 countries has been rising, and amounted to 70% of the total by 1988.

In particular, since 1985, inward FDI to Asian developing countries (such as the \nPRC; Hong Kong, China; and India) has risen dramatically. We can see this in Figure 4. \nThis pattern is quite similar to the outward FDI from developing countries (Figure 5).

As indicated in Figure 6, the importance of these \ndeveloping countries as destination markets increased significantly over time. As a \nconsequence, inward FDI flows between developing countries increased from 14.7% in \n1985 to 18.1% in 2008. In particular, the PRC makes up the largest inward FDI amount, \nwith $110 billion. This suggests how the supply of cheap labor in the PRC is almost \ncertainly a comparative advantage in terms of FDI. World multinational firms investing \nin labor-intensive industries of low-income countries (developing countries) have more \nincentive to exploit cheap wages in the region than do other firms that produce nonlabor-\nintensive products.\nAdditionally, these developing countries perform a key role in terms of FDI source \ncountries (see Figure 7). For example, the Russian Federation invested $56 billion in \ndifferent countries in 2008. Of this total, only 1% ($0.8 billion) was invested into North \ncountries, whereas 99% was invested into other developing countries. Like the Russian \nFederation, other major developing countries, such as Brazil and India, have very similar \npatterns of FDI in recent years. \nFigure 6: Inward FDI to Five Major Recipient Developing Countries (US$ billion)\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n\u201320\n567890123456789012345678\n888889999999999000000000\n999999999999999000000000\n111111111111111222222222\nPRC Russian Hungary Hong Kong, Brazil\nFederation China\nSource:  Author\u2019s calculations based on the OECD.stat http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?r=772795 and UNCTADSTAT http://unctadstat.\nunctad.org/ReportFolders/reportFolders.aspx", "Foreign Direct Investment, Technology Diffusion, and Host Country Productivity Growth | 13\nFigure 7: Outward FDI from Five Major Sending Developing Countries (US$ billion)\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n\u201310\n567890123456789012345678\n888889999999999000000000\n999999999999999000000000\n111111111111111222222222\nHungary Russian PRC Hong Kong, China Brazil\nSource:  Author\u2019s calculations based on the OECD.stat http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?r=772795 and UNCTADSTAT http://unctadstat.\nunctad.org/ReportFolders/reportFolders.aspx\nIt is noteworthy that Asian developing countries have a higher share of both inward and \noutward FDI in South\u2013South FDI flows.

As a consequence, total FDI into the PRC was only \n$9.5 billion in 1992; from that time on, FDI increased dramatically, accounting for $24.6 \nbillion in 1993. Since then the Republic of Korea has emerged rapidly as a source, and \nthe PRC has been the main destination country of Korean FDI in developing countries, \nreceiving approximately 50% of total investment (see Figures 9 and 10). \nFigure 9: Republic of Korea\u2019s Outward FDI (US$ billion)\n \n12,000\n10,000\n8,000\n6,000\n4,000\n2,000\n0\n5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n8 8 8 8 8 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nSource:  Export-Import Bank of Korea. http://keri.koreaexim.go.kr/05_invest/01_statistics/investTotal_year.jsp", "Foreign Direct Investment, Technology Diffusion, and Host Country Productivity Growth | 15\nFigure 10: Republic of Korea\u2019s Outward FDI from Five Major Developing Countries \n(US$ billion)\n3,500\n3,000\n2,500\n2,000\n1,500\n1,000\n500\n0\n5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n8 8 8 8 8 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nPRC Viet Nam Hong Kong, China Malaysia Singapore\nSource:  Export-Import Bank of Korea. http://keri.koreaexim.go.kr/05_invest/01_statistics/investTotal_year.jsp\nMore recently, firms in the Republic of Korea have increasingly used outward FDI as a \nstrategic tool to strengthen their international competitiveness. This transformation has \nbeen prompted by recent trends of rapidly rising nominal wages and more frequent labor\u2013\nmanagement conflicts in the country. Firms have responded by moving their production \nfacilities abroad to maintain their international competitiveness. The government has also \nrecognized the strategic role of outward FDI in strengthening competitiveness abroad, by \nliberalizing its policy regimes as well as providing financing and other incentives.\nAt the same time, as can be seen in Figure 11, a major portion of Korean FDI shifted \nfrom natural resource industries to manufacturing industries, and from investment in \ndeveloped countries (North) to investment in other developing countries (South).  In \nparticular, Korean firms sunk FDI into other developing Asian countries, primarily to enter \nlocal markets, as well as to establish supply bases serving markets in other countries \nincluding the Republic of Korea; that is, to supply goods to world markets by taking \nadvantage of cheap labor in developing Asian countries. With regard to Korean FDI into \nSouth countries, as seen in Figure 12, approximately 75% of Korean investment was \nconcentrated on developing Asian countries and only 25% of investment occurred in \ndeveloping non-Asian countries. This pattern illustrates that Korean multinationals engage \nmore heavily in developing Asian countries than in non-Asian low-income countries.

In particular, \nit is interesting to note that FDI from South countries into Singapore has declined \nsignificantly, reflecting that the destination was moved from Singapore to the PRC and \nIndia. \nOn the other hand, in regard to outward FDI, developing Asian countries, such as the \nPRC, India, Indonesia, and Malaysia, invest in other Asian developing countries. In \nparticular, the PRC is the main source country of FDI in this region.  \nIV.  Data and Summary Statistics\nThe primary source of data for this study was the OECD FDI Statistics. This dataset \nprovides data on bilateral FDI flows not only between OECD countries, but also between \nOECD and non-OECD countries. However, this dataset does not contain information \nregarding South\u2013South FDI flows. The second source of data is the UNCTAD FDI \ndataset. This dataset does not contain information specifically regarding bilateral FDI \nflows, but does list total inbound or outbound FDI by country. Therefore, in order to derive \nthe South\u2013South FDI information, we merged the OECD dataset with the data from \nUNCTAD. \nOur sample contains 122 countries over the whole 1989\u20132008 period, with 22 countries \nclassified as developed countries.8 The data for each country, including gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) and per capita GDP, was obtained from the World Bank dataset. As \nfor total factor productivity (TFP), as is well known, accurately measuring multifactor \nproductivity is quite difficult. In this paper, we obtained TFP growth statistics provided by \nthe Asian Development Bank. To deflate the value of FDI, we used the US GDP deflator, \nand to deflate each country\u2019s data, we used each country\u2019s GDP deflator for every year.\nTable 3 includes a list of variables through which we captured the growth of TFP, FDI \nflows, and imports. In the table, we can see that the average growth of TFP is 0.9%. \nAdditionally, FDI from North countries is larger than from South countries in our sample. \n8  The merged dataset contains 215 countries, but there are many missing values for items such as TFP and inbound \nFDI stock. Therefore, we ended up with a total of 122 countries. ", "18 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 272\nTable 3: Summary Statistics\nVariable Mean Std. Dev.

To \naccomplish this, we constructed the new panel data after 3-year differencing. Since our \ndata spanned the years 1989\u20132008, a panel set of cross-country data was established \nover six 3-year periods from 1989 to 2007, corresponding to the intervals 1989\u20131992, \n1992\u20131995, 1995\u20131998, 1998\u20132001, 2001\u20132004, and 2004\u20132007.9 Figure 13 shows the \npatterns of TFP growth and FDI over time. For instance, the data points in 2001 represent \nthe TFP growth and inward FDI stock growth over 1998\u20132001. At first glance, it is difficult \nto tell whether the two patterns co-move. We also show the FDI inflow from North and \nSouth. It is also difficult to tell whether either pattern moves closely with TFP growth. \nBroken down by country (developed countries [DCs], less developed countries [LDCs], \nand Asian developing countries [ADCs]) it is still somewhat difficult to assess definitively \nthe relationship between FDI and TFP growth. At best, the co-movement appears more \nlikely in the case of LDCs (panel C) than DCs (panel B). If there are FDI externalities in \nNorth\u2013North, we should be able to capture the effect as in panel B, particularly between \nTFP growth and FDI_N. The findings do not seem to support this hypothesis, however. \nAlso, if there exist spillover effects in North\u2013South, TFP growth and FDI_N in panel C \nshould appear to be related. The findings also do not appear to support this hypothesis. \nPanel D shows the patterns in Asian developing countries (ADCs). Again, it is difficult to \ndiscern the co-movement between the variables in a definitive way. Note, however, that \nthis average pattern does not control for country-specific and year-specific effects. The \nreal effect is assessed via econometric tools in the following section. \nCo-movement is more prevalent on the imports side. Figure 14 shows the patterns of \nimports and TFP growth. For instance, the data point of imports in 2001 represents the \nchanges of imports over 1998\u20132001. As one can readily see, TFP growth and imports \nmove closely with one another. Moreover, this co-movement is more likely between the \nimports from DCs than LDCs. The co-movement in developing Asian countries appears to \nbe quite strong. In particular, the Asian financial crisis in 1998 hit imports as well as TFP. \n9  We dropped the 2008 data due to the financial crisis shock. The negative shock in 2008 was so severe that \nincluding the 2008 shock would not produce economically meaningful implications in terms of the long-run \nrelationship between inbound FDI and TFP growth.

Hence, as \nindicated, we construct new panel data after 3-year differencing. Since our data span \nthe period 1989\u20132008, a panel set was established of cross-country data over six 3-year \nperiods from 1989\u2013 2007, corresponding to the intervals 1989\u20131992, 1992\u20131995, 1995\u2013\n1998,1998\u20132001, 2001\u20132004, and 2004\u20132007. Note that the analysis using differenced \ndata does not require country-specific effects, since constant country-specific effects are \nremoved by differencing. Some studies have used annual observations, but the high \nfrequency variations in TFP are more likely to result from business fluctuations than from \ntechnological change. Others have used cross-sectional regressions with period-average \ndata, but they are more likely subject to bias from omitted country-specific variables.\nThe variable of interest is \u03b1. If this variable is significantly positive, we take it as the \n2\nFDI\u2019s positive spillover effect. Table 5 shows the results of this baseline equation. Each \ncolumn in the group uses a different sample. The second column shows the results based \non the whole sample. DCs in the third column represent recipient countries belonging \n10 One may argue that the FDI measure should be divided by the country\u2019s GDP since the size of FDI relative to a \ncountry\u2019s economic size might matter for a country. The hypothesis we have in mind involves technology diffusion, \nhowever. As an extreme example, if a breakthrough technology is available through FDI, it will spill over across \nsectors and enhance the overall TFP, regardless of the size of the country. ", "24 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 272\nto DCs. The fourth column focuses on LDCs. The analysis only on ADCs is in the fifth \ncolumn. \nThe second column shows that there are significant positive impacts of FDI. We also \nfind the positive impacts in imports. As for the magnitude, the impacts of the imports are \nrelatively stronger than FDI. It is demonstrated that a 10% increase of FDI improves TFP \nby 0.2%. In the case of the imports, TFP is improved by 0.7% with a 10% increase in \nimports. When limiting the sample only to DCs, the impacts of FDI disappear. The imports \nstill have positive impacts, however. In the case of LDCs, FDI is found to affect TFP. The \nfinding of positive impacts in LDCs and not in DCs is consistent with previous literature. \nWhen focusing on Asian developing countries, the effects of FDI disappear. The results \nin the fifth column should be interpreted cautiously, however. As we saw in Figure 13, the \nAsian countries were embroiled in a financial crisis in 1998. The finding of no significant \neffects might derive from the negative shocks inherent to that specific year. One solution \nto this is to limit the data to after 1999, in which case, however, there are no sufficient \nobservations to formally examine the relevant effects.\nTable 5: Regression Results\n\u00a0 TFP\n\u00a0 All DCs LDCs ADCs\nFDI   0.0218 **   0.00972   0.0288 **   0.0162\n\u00a0\n  (0.00935)   (0.0114)   (0.0113)   (0.0211)\nImports   0.0680 ***   0.0873 **   0.0633 ***   0.126 ***\n\u00a0   (0.0167)   (0.0365)   (0.0192)   (0.0417)\nObservations 491 105 386 67\nR-squared 0.091 0.368 0.096 0.512\n*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.\nADCs = Asian developing countries, DCs = developed countries, FDI = foreign direct investment, LDCs = less developed countries, \nTFP = total factor productivity.\nNote:  Standard errors in parentheses.\nSource:  Authors' estimates.\nAs indicated, we distinguish FDI sending countries\u2019 income level, FDI from DCs, and FDI \nfrom LDCs. The other possible channel of spillover effects, imports, is also distinguished \nby the income levels of the exporting countries. \nTable 6 shows the results, some of which are noteworthy. The second column shows that \nthe sending countries\u2019 income level is relevant. That is, FDI from DCs have significantly \npositive impacts on TFP, whereas FDI from LDCs does not. As for the imports, the \nincome level also matters. Limiting the sample to DCs appears to produce some counter-\nintuitive results, however. The effects of FDI from DCs are negative and significant. \nOne possible explanation for this is that FDI from DCs, rather than bringing advanced \ntechnologies, might affect a domestic country through intensive competition, such that \ngood quality domestic firms are crowded out. Still, the imports from DCs do have a ", "Foreign Direct Investment, Technology Diffusion, and Host Country Productivity Growth | 25\npositive impact. In the fourth column, we do observe some so-called North\u2013South effects. \nThat is, FDI from DCs to LDCs is positive. On the other hand, we do not observe South\u2013\nSouth effects, as the FDI from LDCs is not significant. The imports from DCs also exert a \npositive effect. As for ADCs, we do not find significant impact from FDI. In conclusion, the \nsending countries\u2019 income level clearly is relevant. In particular, the FDI or imports from \nDCs have positive impacts on LDCs\u2019 economies.11\nTable 6: Results (by source country\u2019s income level)\n\u00a0 TFP\n\u00a0 All DCs LDCs ADCs\nFDI from North   0.00673 **   \u22120.00590 **   0.0105 ***   \u22120.00745\n\u00a0   (0.00309)   (0.00276)   (0.00391)   (0.0101)\nFDI from South   0.00231   0.00142   0.00355   0.000485\n\u00a0   (0.00167)   (0.00119)   (0.00245)   (0.00289)\nImport from North   0.0560 ***   0.0779 **   0.0545 ***   0.101 **\n\u00a0   (0.0148)   (0.0308)   (0.0168)   (0.0413)\nImport from South   0.0262   0.00815   0.0251   0.0223\n\u00a0   (0.0164)   (0.0207)   (0.0192)   (0.0627)\nObservations 491 105 386 67\nR-squared 0.102 0.409 0.111 0.533\n*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.\nADCs = Asian developing countries, DCs = developed countries, FDI = foreign direct investment, LDCs = less developed countries, \nTFP = total factor productivity.\nNote:  Standard errors in parentheses.\nSource:  Authors' estimates.\nThe FDI variables are, however, endogenous. That is, the significant impact of the FDI \nmight reflect co-movement rather than causality. In Table 7, we estimate the equation \nusing two-stage least squares, with the instrument variables (IV) for FDI. The IV for FDI is \none lagged variable of FDI, which is used widely in this type of exercise.12 The estimation \nresults are shown in Table 7. The positive impacts of the imports are still valid in all \ncases. As for the FDI from DCs, the significant positive impacts are found in the whole \nsample and in the LDCs\u2019 cases. On the other hand, the negative impacts of FDI on DCs \nbecome insignificant. \n11 Another exercise we conducted involved the relative income level of LDCs. We assessed whether high-income \nSouth countries experienced effects differing from low-income South countries. As indicated, however, the \nbilateral FDI data was not available for most LDCs. Considering the limited data availability, the best practice we \ncould conduct was to group some OECD countries, such as the Republic of Korea and Mexico, as high-income \nSouth countries. The empirical results, however, produced no meaningful implications. That is, FDI from DCs still \nhad positive impacts, but the FDI from South countries, regardless of whether it was high or low, did not exert \nsignificant impacts.  \n12 One lagged variable might be correlated with TFP as well, but finding good instrument variables is challenging, \nparticularly on the macro level. Simultaneously, we acknowledge that endogeneity problems might exist in the \ncase of the imports. Since the focus of this paper is on FDI, however, we did not pursue IV estimations for the \nimports. ", "26 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 272\nThe final exercise involves the absorptive capacity hypothesis. According to this \nhypothesis, a country should be sufficiently developed to absorb the externalities brought \nby the FDI or imports. Using the average educational attainment of countries as provided \nin Barro and Lee\u2019s database, we evaluate this hypothesis. We assume that higher \neducational attainment means that a country\u2019s human capital is sufficiently accumulated \nto absorb the positive externalities. The results are reported in Table 8. According to the \ntable, the absorptive capacity matters for imports, not FDI. The interaction terms are \nsignificant mostly in the case of the imports, while they are not significant in terms of FDI. \nTable 7: Instrument Variables Estimation Results\nTFP\nAll DCs LDCs ADCs\nFDI from North   0.0104 *   \u22120.00211   0.0136*   \u22120.00497\n\u00a0   (0.00574)   (0.00442)   (0.00770)   (0.0126)\nFDI from South   0.00599   \u22120.00301   0.0104   0.0106\n\u00a0   (0.00471)   (0.00341)   (0.00733)   (0.00805)\nImport from North   0.0576 ***   0.0750 **   0.0579 ***   0.0902 *\n\u00a0   (0.0149)   (0.0357)   (0.0167)   (0.0482)\nImport from South   0.0220   0.0259   0.0224   0.0155\n\u00a0   (0.0169)   (0.0295)   (0.0191)   (0.0712)\nObservations 455 85 370 60\nR-squared 0.093 0.122 0.102 0.414\n*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.\nADCs = Asian developing countries, DCs = developed countries, FDI = foreign direct investment, LDCs = less developed countries, \nTFP = total factor productivity.\nNote:  Standard errors in parentheses.

Conclusions \nThe principal objective of this paper was to assess whether FDI exerts statistically \nsignificant effects on the host countries\u2019 economic performance, including in terms of \nTFP. These effects are frequently referred to as FDI externalities or spillover effects. \nThis paper also attempts to assess whether these spillover effects depend on the \nsending countries\u2019 income level. There are some crucial questions that have been left \nunaddressed in previous literature; for example: To what extent can the role of FDI flows \nin spillovers be determined, and can the unique characteristics of South\u2013South FDI flows \nbe distinguished? We analyzed the manner of spillover inherent to FDI flow, and how that \ncontributes to growth in general, particularly in the case of South\u2013South FDI flows.\nRecent empirical literature has stressed that the spillover effects of North\u2013South FDI \nare quite plausible, as less productive firms may experience more benefits from foreign \ntechnology. Even though there is a well-known empirical and theoretical link between FDI \nand technology spillover, many empirical studies attribute their findings solely to North\u2013\nNorth or North\u2013South contents. However, research regarding South\u2013South FDI spillover \nis quite rare. Therefore, the major contribution of this paper was to categorize the various \nforms of FDI by host and home countries, and to figure out the differences among them. \nIn particular, we will focus on the effects of South\u2013South FDI flows.\nUsing the data of OECD FDI Statistics and the UNCTAD FDI dataset, we determined that \nFDI has positive impacts on LDCs. Further, we determined that the impacts of the FDI \nfrom DCs tend to be more prevalent. That is, so-called North\u2013South effects were found \nin this paper. We did not detect any so-called South\u2013South effects, however. We also \nevaluated the other channel, imports, and determined its significant impacts on TFP.

This paper evaluates whether these \nspillover effects depend on the sending countries\u2019 income levels, and shows that the \nimpacts of FDI from developed countries, North\u2013South effects, are more prevalent, but \nnot the South\u2013South effects.\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its \ndeveloping member countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their \npeople. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the \nworld\u2019s poor: 1.8 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million \nstruggling on less than $1.25 a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through \ninclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional \nintegration. \n  Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its \nmain instruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, \nequity investments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/economics\nISSN: 1655-5252\nPublication Stock No. WPS113949\nAugust  2011\n< 0113 9495 >\nPrinted on recycled paper Printed in the Philippines"], "metadata": {"Author": "Hongshik Lee, Joonhyung Lee, and Hyuk-hwang Kim", "CreationDate": "D:20110928114220+08'00'", "Creator": "Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)", "Keywords": "technology spillover, fdi, south-south, total factor productivity (TFP), foreign direct investment,  economics working paper no. 272", "ModDate": "D:20130904112440+08'00'", "Producer": "Adobe PDF Library 9.9", "Subject": "In this paper, the authors investigate whether foreign direct investment has statistically significant effects on host countries' economic performance, such as total factor productivity.", "Title": "Foreign Direct Investment, Technology Diffusion, and Host Country Productivity Growth (No. 272)", "Trapped": "False"}}
