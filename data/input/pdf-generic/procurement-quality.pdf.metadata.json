VFM is part of a holistic procurement structure \nwith three support pillars: efficiency, quality, and flexibility. The two key principles of \ntransparency and fairness weave across all elements of the structure.\n\nt r a n sparency\n\nValue for Money\nThe effective, efficient, and economic use of resources,  \nwhich requires an evaluation of relevant costs and benefits along  \nwith an assessment of risks, nonprice attributes, and/or total cost  \nof ownership as appropriate\n\nefficiency\n\nQuality\n\nFlexibility\n\n\u2022\tDecreased transaction \n\n\u2022\tContract management \n\n\u2022\tOpen competitive \n\ncosts\n\nsupport\n\n\u2022\tIncreased skills\n\u2022\tIncreased high-level \ntechnology usage\n\n\u2022\tImproved \n\nprocurement planning\n\n\u2022\tPrompt resolution of \n\ncomplaints\n\n\u2022\tImproved developing \n\nmember country \nprocurement process \n\n\u2022\tSupport and \n\n\u2022\tImproved \n\nencouragement \nof e-procurement \nsystems\n\nprocurement planning\n\n\u2022\tGovernance\n\u2022\tContracts with clear \nperformance criteria\n\u2022\tMinimal number of \n\ncomplaints\n\n\u2022\tImproved ADB \n\nprocesses \n\nFairnes s\n\nbidding\n\n\u2022\tDecentralization\n\u2022\tAccreditation \nfor alternative \nprocurement \narrangements\n\u2022\tPrinciples-based \n\ndecisions\n\u2022\tImproved \n\nprocurement planning\n\n\u2022\tDelegation\n\u2022\tBids with weighted  \n\nproposal  \ncriteria \n\ntime\n\nTime is an important element of VFM. When a project is delivered promptly or when a \nprocess is completed rapidly, greater value is created for all stakeholders. For example, a \nroad project completed early provides economic benefit, security, or other value to the \ncommunity it serves. It increases the return on investment to the executing agency and \naccelerates the project and payment cycle to the successful bidder. Likewise, a project \ndelivered late loses significant value. \n\nWhen considering VFM in the context of procurement, pay attention to anything \nthat (i)\u00a0shortens the procurement cycle time frame or (ii) accelerates delivery of the \ndevelopment project.\n\n\fAbout This Publication\n\nvii\n\nobjective\n\nThis guidance note is intended to assist readers by elaborating on and explaining  \nADB\u2019s 2017\u00a0procurement policy and procurement regulations for borrowers \n(including grant\u00a0recipients). \n\nThis note identifies additional information for the reader to consider when applying ADB\u2019s \nprocurement policy and procurement regulations to their circumstances. \n\nliving document\n\nThis guidance note is intended to be a living document and will be revised as required.\n\nBe sure to check the ADB Business Center website for the latest version and updates,  \nhttps://www.adb.org/business/main.\n\nthe reader \n\nIn many circumstances, readers are expected to use this guidance note in a manner unique \nto their needs.

The financing agreement governs the legal relationships \nbetween the borrower and ADB. The rights and obligations between the borrower and the \nprovider of goods, works, or services are governed by the specific procurement document \nissued by the borrower and by the contract signed between the borrower and the provider, \nand not by this guidance note.\n\n\fviii\n\nabbreViations\n\nADB \n\nCMP \n\nPPP \n\nSMART \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\nAsian Development Bank\n\ncontract management plan\n\npublic\u2013private partnership\n\n specific, measurable, achievable, relevant,  \ntime-bound\n\nVFM \n\nvalue for money\n\n\fexeCutiVe suMMary\n\nix\n\nThis guidance note provides information to borrowers (including grant recipients) \non applying the principle of quality in the key stages of the ADB procurement \ncycle (i.e., procurement planning, design and bidding document preparation, bid \nevaluation, and contract management).

Quality is one part of the value for money (VFM) equation, which seeks \nto compare the benefits gained from improved quality against the costs incurred, to \nachieve fit-for-purpose development project outcomes. As\u00a0such, this guidance note \nshould be read in conjunction with the Guidance Note on Value for Money.\n\n1.2 \nThis guidance note applies to quality in the procurement of goods, works, \nplant, and nonconsulting services under projects financed in whole or in part by an \nADB loan or grant, or by ADB-administered funds, for which the ADB Procurement \nPolicy: Goods, Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting Services (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time) and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers: Goods, \nWorks, Nonconsulting and Consulting Services (2017, as amended from time to \ntime) apply. Quality with respect to the procurement of consulting services is dealt \nwith in the Guidance Note on Consulting Services Administered by ADB Borrowers.\n\n1.3 \nThis guidance note discusses quality within the (i) procurement \nplanning, (ii) design (specification and engineering design) and bidding document \npreparation, (iii) bid evaluation and contract award, and (iv) implementation and \ncontract management stages of the ADB procurement cycle (Figure 1).\n\nB.  \n\nAccountabilities for Quality\n\n1.4 \nQuality is an important factor at all stages of the contract and project life \ncycles, from conceptualization and business case development; through planning \nand design; to procurement, implementation, and completion. The procurement \nprocess is one important phase in the contract and project life cycle which, like \nother phases, presents an opportunity to assure that quality requirements are \nmet or exceeded and that procurement processes are fit for purpose, taking those \nrequirements into account.\n\n\f2\n\nQuality\n\nFigure 1: The ADB Procurement Cycle\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\nAll parties to the project and its contracts contribute to quality: ADB; \n\n1.5 \nthe borrower; and the contractors, suppliers, or service providers.1 Project owners, \nproject managers, stakeholders, contract managers, and contractors need to \nbe actively engaged at appropriate points in the process to ensure that the \nprocurement process contributes to quality outcomes.\n\nC.  \n\nThe role of Quality in Procurement\n\n1.6 \nQuality is one of the core procurement principles under the 2017 ADB \nprocurement policy. The others are economy, efficiency, fairness, transparency, \nand VFM. This is a move away from the traditional perspective of quality in \nprocurement. Historically, quality in procurement has often been limited to \nincorporating a specification of minimum requirements into bidding documents \nand then awarding the contract to the lowest priced bidder that substantially meets \nthese minimum requirements.\n\n1  Hereafter in this guidance note, contractors, suppliers, and service providers are collectively \n\nreferred to as \u201ccontractors.\u201d\n\nPROCUREMENTCYCLEFairnessValue forMoneyQualityEfficiencyEconomyTransparencyProject ConceptualizationProcurement Planning Procurement PlanProject Procurement Risk Assessment Project Administration ManualTransaction Technical Assistance Procurement Risk CategorizationBidding DocumentsContract AwardContract Management PlanFeedback or EvaluationImplementation andContract ManagementProject Completion ReportContract Close Lessons LearnedCountry Partnership StrategyCountry and Sector/Agency Procurement Risk AssessmentBid EvaluationEvaluation ReportsBidding\f Introduction\n\n3\n\n1.7 \nWhile this approach is appropriate for low-risk procurement of highly \nstandardized products and simple services, it is less suitable for more complex \ngoods, works, and services, where there may be trade-offs between quality and \ncosts. For these types of procurement, awarding the contract to the lowest priced \nbidder that meets the minimum requirements may end up adversely affecting \ncontract or project outcomes or benefits, total life cycle costs, and implementation \nschedules.\n\nThe elevation of quality to a core procurement principle reflects ADB\u2019s \n\n1.8 \nview that considering quality during the procurement process is essential, albeit not \nsufficient, to achieve VFM and to improve the likelihood of achieving contract and \nproject outcomes and development objectives.\n\nD.  \n\nSubjectivity in the Assessment of Quality\n\nThe specification and evaluation of quality may introduce subjectivity, \n\n1.9 \nwhich may be difficult to justify if challenged and be prone to abuse. This potential \nsubjectivity requires careful examination during the procurement risk assessment \nprocess.\n\nAssessment of qualitative factors can be open to risks of abuse of \n\n1.10 \ndiscretion and conscious or unconscious bias influencing decision-making. These \nrisks need to be addressed and this guidance note provides some suggestions on \nmethodologies that can be used to increase objectivity and auditability of the \nevaluation of qualitative criteria.\n\n\fii.\u2003defining Quality\n\nA.   Definition of Quality\n\nADB defined quality as a core procurement principle for the first time \n\n2.1 \nin its 2017 procurement policy. The procurement policy defines quality as the \nprinciple that \u201crequires that the procurement arrangements are structured to \nprocure inputs and deliver outputs of appropriate standard in a timely and effective \nmanner to achieve the project outcomes and development objectives, taking into \naccount the context, risk, value, and complexity of procurement.\u201d\n\n2.2 \npart of the definition in the following subsections.\n\nThis definition of quality can be more easily understood by analyzing each \n\n1. \n\n\u2026the procurement arrangements are structured\u2026\n\n(i)  The borrower\u2019s procurement practitioners have a responsibility during \nthe procurement planning stage to analyze and select procurement \narrangements that are fit for purpose, considering the nature, value, \nrisk, and complexity of the procurement.\n\n(ii)  The 2017 procurement regulations (in Appendix 2, para. 4[e]) define \n\u201cprocurement arrangements\u201d as \u201ccomprising procurement methods, \nqualifications and evaluation criteria, and contracting strategy \n(contract packaging, types of contracts, key contractual provisions, \nand key delivery and payment milestones), including the justification \nfor each decision; and outline of the key specifications and quality \nrequirements.\u201d\n\n(iii)  The Guidance Note on Strategic Procurement Planning provides further \ninformation on the activities in procurement planning, including \nanalysis and development of procurement strategies. \n\n2. \n\n\u2026to procure inputs and deliver outputs of appropriate standard in  \na timely and effective manner...\n\n(i)  The procurement arrangements should be designed to ensure that \nthey result in the selection of a bidder (or bidders) that has the \nrequired capability to supply the goods, or provide the services or \nworks, to the appropriate standard.\n\n\fDefining Quality\n\n5\n\n(ii)  Bidders must be aware of the requirements and measures of the \n\nquality of outcomes so they would be able to meet the appropriate \nstandard. An accurate and sufficiently comprehensive specification of \nrequirements (or design) is, therefore, a critical contributor to quality \noutcomes.\n\n(iii)  An essential aspect of quality is the assessment of the bidder\u2019s \n\ncapability to meet the requirements. Therefore, prequalification may \nbe required, especially for more complex goods, works, and services, \nwhere it is usually not sufficient to specify requirements and to then \naward on the basis of price alone. The borrower should assess the \nlikelihood that bidders will be capable of meeting contract objectives \n(including quality, schedule, and cost).  \n\n3. \n\n\u2026to achieve the project outcomes and development objectives, taking \ninto account the context, risk, value, and complexity of procurement.\n\n(i)  The aim of procurement planning and strategy development, \n\nand bidding, evaluation, and contractor selection, is to increase \nthe probability that the work of contractors contributes to the \nachievement of project outcomes in line with ADB\u2019s principles and \nstandards of integrity.\n\n(ii)  This process should be informed by procurement risk assessments at \n\nthe country, sector or agency, and project level, to plan and implement \nrisk mitigation strategies by understanding the risks to quality at each \nstage of the procurement cycle. The Guidance Note on Procurement \nRisk Framework and the Guidance Note on Strategic Procurement \nPlanning provide further information on these risk assessments.\n\n(iii)  The procurement process plays a critical part in achieving quality \nproject outcomes. ADB encourages an active role with regard to \nquality in the procurement process, to ensure project outcomes are \nachieved. \n\nB.  \n\nDefining Quality for Individual Procurements\n\nQuality can be defined in various ways depending on the nature of the \n\n2.3 \ngoods, works, or services being procured. Table 1 provides examples of some ways \nquality can be defined for various procurement types.\n\nThe procurement regulations (Appendix 3, paras. 36\u201341) require designs \n\n2.4 \nand specifications to have a defined level of quality. This does not mean the highest \nquality available (which could result in \u201cgold plating,\u201d i.e., a quality higher than is \nneeded given the project objectives), but the appropriate quality which satisfies the \nobjectives and delivers VFM within the available budget.\n\n\f6\n\nQuality\n\nType of Procurement\n\nStandard goods\n\nTable 1: Definitions of Quality for Individual Procurements\n\nRoutine construction services\n\n\u2022\tTechnical specifications of the defined \n\nWays to Define Quality\n\n\u2022\tTechnical specifications and standards\n\u2022\tProduct characteristics and tolerances\n\n\u2022\tIndustry standards applying to construction \n\ninputs\n\nmethods\n\nimpact\n\nLarge infrastructure projects, or where the use \nof high-level technology is proposed\n\n\u2022\tFunctional objectives achieved\n\u2022\tServiceability, durability, and functionality\n\u2022\tSocial, economic, and environmental \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\nC.  \n\nContribution to Quality of the Procurement Cycle\n\nTo improve the likelihood that the result of a procurement is fit for \n\n2.5 \npurpose and that it meets the requirements of the borrower and/or end users, \nthe contribution to quality of each stage of the procurement cycle needs to \nbe understood. Figure 2 summarizes these contributions for key stages of the \nprocurement cycle. \n\nThe contribution to quality, the potential issues that affect quality, and \n\n2.6 \nthe actions that can be taken to avoid or mitigate the impact are described for each \nkey stage of the procurement cycle in the following sections of this guidance note. \nAppendix 1 provides a checklist to support this process.\n\n\fFigure 2: Contribution to Quality of Key Stages in the Procurement Cycle\n\nDefining Quality\n\n7\n\nPlanning\n\n\u2022\t Accuracy \nof project \nobjectives\n\u2022\t Borrower \ncapability\n\n\u2022\t Market capability\n\u2022\t Power of \n\ncontractors\n\u2022\t Correct supply \npositioning\n\u2022\t Identification of \n\nkey risks\n\u2022\t Allocation of \ncontract risk\n\u2022\t Appropriate \nprocurement \nstrategy \n\nDesign and \nBidding Document \nPreparation\n\n\u2022\t Accuracy of \nspecification\n\u2022\t Performance \nmeasures \nsupporting \nobjectives\n\u2022\t Compensation \n\nmodel \nsupporting \ndesired \nbehaviors\n\u2022\t Translation of \nrequirements \ninto engineering \ndesign\n\u2022\t Descoping \nwithout \ncompromising \nquality\n\nBid Evaluation and \nContract Award\n\n\u2022\t Evaluation \n\ncriteria aligned \nwith desired \ncontractor \ncharacteristics\n\u2022\t Bid documents \n\nelicit information \nsupporting \ncriteria\n\u2022\t Evidence \n\nsupporting \nbidder claims\n\n\u2022\t Separate \n\nevaluation of \nnonprice and \nprice information\n\n\u2022\t Sufficient \n\nweighting given \nto quality in \nbidder ranking\n\u2022\t Risk regarding \nabuse of \ndiscretion \naddressed\n\nImplementation \nand Contract \nManagement\n\n\u2022\t Performance \n\nmeasures aligned \nwith contract \nobjectives\n\u2022\t Performance \nmeasures are \nSMART\n\u2022\t Sufficient \nresourcing \nprovided \nfor effective \ncontract \nmanagement\n\n\u2022\t Clear \n\nrelationship \nstructure \nbetween the \nborrower and \ncontractor\n\u2022\t Adequate \n\nmanagement of \nchange\n\n\u2022\t Management of \ncontract closure\n\nSMART = specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound.\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\n\fiii.\u2003Procurement Planning\n\nA.  \n\nContribution to Quality\n\n3.1 \nThe procurement planning stage involves decisions that impact on quality \nthroughout the procurement process and over the life of a contract. It is critical that \nprocurement planning is done well, and that quality is considered, since the impacts \non quality can be high and can carry through the entire project or contract life cycle.\n\nAs per section II of this guidance note, the selection of procurement \n\n3.2 \narrangements is an important contributor to the achievement of project objectives. \nIt is critical that the borrower\u2019s or end user\u2019s needs, and minimum requirements and \nproject objectives, are clearly identified at the outset of the procurement process \n(or, preferably, beforehand during the project conceptualization stage of the ADB \nprocurement cycle).\n\nB.  \n\nPotential Issues Affecting Quality\n\nPotential issues affecting quality can occur during each of the activities \n\n3.3 \ncomprising procurement planning (the Guidance Note on Strategic Procurement \nPlanning has more information).

It is imperative to ensure that the requirements and project objectives \nstated in the procurement plan accurately and clearly reflect the needs of the \nborrower or end user, and that project objectives are aligned among project owners \nand/or project stakeholders. This can be achieved by\n\n(i)  performing the procurement planning stage comprehensively and \n\nwith care;\n\n(ii)  engaging extensively with end user representatives and project owners \n\n(on a fit-for-purpose basis); and\n\n(iii)  recording the borrower\u2019s understanding of the project objectives and \nend user needs in writing and asking end users and project owners \nto validate and confirm the stated objectives and needs, using the \nGuidance Note on Strategic Procurement Planning and ADB templates. \n\n3.5 \nProject delivery methodology not defined. For some projects, it may not \nbe possible to define the delivery methodology clearly because their contracts can \nbe performed in different and innovative ways, the contracts may be subject to an \nundefined technology solution provided by the supply market, or the project owner \nmay be considered an \u201cuninformed\u201d buyer where knowledge and expertise on how \nto deliver the requirements does not exist within the project owner\u2019s organization. \n\n3.6 \ncan be used to mitigate the risk to quality:\n\nWhen the project delivery methodology is not defined, several measures \n\n(i)  Develop a performance specification (the Guidance Note on Strategic \nProcurement Planning provides more details), in which the outcomes \nof the contract are defined while allowing bidders to specify how the \n\n\f10\n\nQuality\n\ncontract is delivered. For example, a new road construction contract \ncould be specified in terms of capability to carry certain volumes of \ntraffic, or a specified number of heavy vehicles per day, rather than \nspecifying the number of traffic lanes and road construction materials.\n\n(ii)  Consider a multistage procurement process, using the first stage to \n\ndetermine the range of solutions available in the market and using that \ninformation to more accurately define the requirements in the second \nstage of the procurement process. Depending on the outcomes of the \nfirst stage, the second stage could be a competitive tender or a direct \nnegotiation with a contractor that offers the only viable solution.\n(iii)  An alternative to a multistage approach is to use a \u201cdesign and build\u201d \napproach, whereby a competitive bid is conducted with bidders \nrequired to propose a solution and provide pricing for both the design \nand implementation phases.\n\n(iv)  An initial stage of the bid could be used to identify a contractor(s) \nwith whom a collaboration could be formed. This would allow the \nborrower and the contractor(s) to work closely together through the \ndesign and implementation stages. This is often associated with a \n\u201ccost plus,\u201d or component pricing, compensation model, to reduce the \nrisk to the contractor of an unclear scope.\n\n(v)  If requirements are unclear or the buyer is an \u201cuninformed\u201d buyer, \nconsultants may be hired to add their expertise and knowledge. \n\n3.7 \nIn complex infrastructure projects, including projects that use high-level \ntechnology, feasibility studies can be used to identify the necessary quality of the \ninfrastructure project and select a contract implementation method, such as the \npublic sector conventional model or a public\u2013private partnership (PPP) model \n(where \u201cconventional model\u201d here means contract delivery methods other than \nPPP), that will best deliver the requirements.\n\nDifferent methods of the conventional model may carry higher or lower \n\n3.8 \nlevels of quality risk. The conventional model methods that may be considered \ninclude design\u2013bid\u2013build, design\u2013and\u2013build (or engineer\u2013procure\u2013construct), \ndesign\u2013build\u2013maintain (or engineer\u2013procure\u2013construct\u2013maintain), and design\u2013\nbuild\u2013maintain\u2013operate, among others.\n\nThe selection of the model may be limited by factors such as the \n\n3.9 \navailability of public or private funds, the urgency of the infrastructure need, and \nthe number of private sector entities able to participate in a PPP model. The \nGuidance Note on Public\u2013Private Partnerships has further details on the PPP model.\n\n2. \n\ninsufficient borrower Capability\n\nThe borrower capability assessment conducted during procurement \n\n3.10 \nplanning may identify a gap in the ability of the borrower to identify and manage the \nquality expectations, or to exercise sound discretion in the subjective evaluation \nof the quality of bids received. This may indicate the need for additional design \n\n\fProcurement Planning\n\n11\n\nconsultants, further assistance in project preparation, increased project supervision, \nincreased procurement oversight, or enhanced contract management provisions. \n\nThe borrower may also refer to sources such as universities, research \n\n3.11 \nbodies, nongovernment organizations, think tanks, etc. The borrower may also seek \ncritical inputs directly from the private sector, which may have special expertise or \nskills. Engaging the private sector as a partner will, in some circumstances, improve \nthe quality of the output through additional funding, expertise, and innovation.\n\n3. \n\nMarket issues\n\nQualified contractors do not exist in the geographical market or \n\n3.12 \nmarket sector. If the market analysis indicates that suitable contractors are not \navailable to deliver the contract to the required quality, the following mitigating \nmeasures could be taken:\n\n(i)  Expand the market analysis to consider other geographical \n\nmarkets (international or national) or market sectors (e.g., for road \nconstruction, consider civil works contractors with experience in \nsimilar activities, such as the construction of an airport runway, where \nrelevant).\n\n(ii)  Select a contractor with the capability closest to the requirements and \n\nthen work with them to develop their capability to the required level. \n\nThe power of contractors is high, and the risk of substitutes and new \n\n3.13 \nentrants is low. This may result in a lower motivation for the current, available \ncontractors to provide high-quality goods, works, or services. Mitigating measures \ninclude\n\n(i)  building incentives and penalties into the contract linked to quality \n\n(ii)  broadening the supply base to increase competition among \n\nmeasures;\n\ncontractors;\n\n(iii)  expanding markets, e.g., in cases where the technology is new; and\n(iv)  insourcing the requirement (i.e., contracting out a third-party provider \n\nto perform the task[s]). \n\n3.14 \nIncorrect supply positioning. This can have significant impacts on quality. \nFor example, a contract or requirement incorrectly categorized during procurement \nplanning (the Guidance Note on Strategic Procurement Planning has further \ninformation) could result in under-resourcing of contract management and loss \nof value from the contract. Performing supply positioning in a considered way and \nvalidating the results from experienced procurement personnel and stakeholders \nmay mitigate this risk.\n\n\f12\n\nQuality\n\n4. \n\nrisk Management issues\n\nrisk assessment fails to cover key risks and key stages of the contract. \n\n3.15 \nRisk assessments are a critical activity to ensure quality not only throughout the \nprocurement process, but also over the life of the contract. It is important that \nthe risk assessments are effective, in that they cover each stage of a project and \nits contracts, including the procurement process, contract implementation, and \ncontract closure. They must also be done with care to ensure that all key risks are \nconsidered at each key stage.\n\n3.16 \nOverallocation of risk to contractor reduces market motivation to \nparticipate. An allocation of risks to the parties to a contract that is not aligned \nwith their ability to control them may lead either to significant increases in cost, \nor to reduced interest of prospective contractors in the contract, or both. The \nborrower should be cognizant of the impact on quality of risk allocation and design \nthe requirements to ensure VFM. Risk allocation can also be reviewed during the \nprocurement process in response to feedback and pricing received from bidders, \ne.g., where a multistage procurement method is used.\n\n5. \n\noptions analysis and Procurement strategy development issues\n\nProcurement strategy options are not appropriate to ensure quality or \n\n3.17 \ndo not adequately address risks. A lack of knowledge or diligence in developing \nstrategic options or in selecting a suboptimal procurement strategy may affect the \nquality or fail to address integrity-related issues or other key risks. The borrower \nneeds to be aware of strategic options as discussed in the Guidance Note on Strategic \nProcurement Planning, including the concept of packaging into \u201clots,\u201d risk\u00a0allocation, \nthe contracting model, procurement method, pricing model, type of specification, \nevaluation criteria, and performance measures (i.e., key performance indicators). \nThe borrower should consider seeking assistance from procurement consultants if \nthis knowledge is not available within its executing and/or implementing agencies.\n\n\fiV.\u2003design and bidding document \nPreparation\n\nIn this guidance note, \u201cdesign\u201d refers to both (i) the specification \n\n4.1 \ndevelopment activity within the bidding stage of the procurement cycle and  \n(ii)\u00a0the engineering or architectural design of a project, where this is most common \nin infrastructure construction or complex high-level technology projects. \n\nA.  \n\nContribution to Quality\n\nWhile the procurement planning stage identifies requirements and \n\n4.2 \ndevelops a procurement strategy, the bidding stage involves the development of \nprocurement documentation in preparation for the procurement process, including \nthe development of the specification.\n\nThe development of the specification is an important step in accurately \n\n4.3 \ntranslating the borrower\u2019s or end user\u2019s requirements or project objectives into \na detailed written document. The specification should clearly communicate \nthe requirements to bidders in sufficient detail so they can formulate a delivery \nmethodology that will provide the required quality, and can accurately price the \nrequirement.\n\n4.4 \n\nGenerally, there are two broad categories of specifications:\n\n(i)  Conformance-based specifications describe in detail the technical \n\nrequirements of the design, method of production, construction, \nservices, and/or delivery.\n\n(ii)  Performance-based specifications describe the outcomes, results, \nor outputs related to the business or functional performance \nrequirements. \n\nThe Guidance Note on Value for Money discusses these two categories in more \ndetail, and their implications on quality.\n\nFor nonconsulting services, the specification is often developed in the \n\n4.5 \nform of a work statement and service level agreement. These are discussed further \nin the Guidance Note on Nonconsulting Services Administered by ADB Borrowers.\n\nFor civil works, an engineering design is a detailed way of translating \n\n4.6 \nborrower or end user needs or project objectives into requirements to be delivered \nby the contractor. It is usually, but not exclusively, used for complex construction \n\n\f14\n\nQuality\n\nand high-level technology projects, which involve requirements that are not \neasily reflected in a written specification or for which the means of delivery of the \noutcomes are not defined in detail.\n\n4.7 \nAn engineering design has a significant impact on quality, in that \nit specifies the function and form in detail and, therefore, dictates the way \nrequirements will be met by the contractor. For example, the serviceability \nrequirements of a concrete bridge are dictated by the dimensions and span of \nbridge beams and the thickness of concrete cover over the steel reinforcement. \nOnce this is specified, assuming design and implementation are separate contracts, \nthe contractor has little ability to affect serviceability. The contractor\u2019s primary task, \nthen, is to meet the design specification.\n\nB.  \n\nPotential Issues Affecting Quality\n\n4.8 \nThe specification will usually include performance measures (i.e., key \nperformance indicators), a compensation model, and incentives and penalties. \nPoorly written specifications can have distorting effects on competition, and on \ncontractor behavior and quality of deliverables.\n\n4.9 \nengineering designs that affect quality are described in Table 3.\n\nSome of the issues associated with developing specifications and \n\nTable 3: Issues Affecting Quality in the Design and Bidding Document \nPreparation Stage\n\nActivity\n\nDevelopment of \nspecification\n\nPotential Issues Affecting Quality\n\n\u2022\tInaccurate translation of requirements into written specification\n\u2022\tDifficulty in defining requirements\n\u2022\tPerformance measures (i.e., key performance indicators) distort \n\ncontractor behavior and competition\n\n\u2022\tCompensation model distorts contractor behavior and competition\n\nEngineering design\n\n\u2022\tInaccurate translation of requirements into design\n\u2022\tInsufficient detail in design leading to misinterpretation by \n\ncontractor\n\n\u2022\tDespecification to reduce costs\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\nC.   Mitigating Measures\n\n1. \n\nspecification issues\n\n4.10 \nInaccurate translation of requirements into written specification. \nThe accurate translation of project objectives and requirements into a\u00a0written \nspecification that can be understood by bidders and implemented by the \n\n\fDesign and Bidding Document Preparation\n\n15\n\ncontractor is critical in ensuring quality contract outcomes. Inaccurate \nspecifications may lead to outcomes that do not meet project objectives.\n\n4.11 \n\nThis risk can be mitigated by\n\n(i)  using a structured approach to collecting stakeholder requirements,\n(ii)  requiring stakeholders to validate and approve the specification,\n(iii)  requiring stakeholders to validate and approve contract performance \n\n(iv)  involving stakeholders in the development of procurement evaluation \n\nmeasures and targets, and\n\ncriteria. \n\n4.12 \ncontractual mechanisms, including\n\nThe risk of poor quality can be mitigated through the specification of \n\n(i)  quality assurance mechanisms, such as quality testing and inspection;\n(ii)  warranties;\n(iii)  defect liability clauses;\n(iv)  functional guarantees;\n(v)  performance securities;\n(vi)  insurances; and\n(vii) completion or performance certificates linked to payments. \n\nDifficulty in defining requirements. Depending on the contract, the \n\n4.13 \nspecification of requirements and level of quality can be straightforward and \nobjective or ambiguous and subjective.\n\nIn more straightforward requirements, accuracy of specification of quality \n\n4.14 \nlevels can be achieved using industry product or service standards, which may be \neasily measured by referring to physical characteristics. In the case of goods, the \nspecification will usually involve a description of the characteristics of the goods \nas well as their quantity, quality, durability, and safety issues, and may involve \na description of physical properties, such as the materials, or the production \nprocesses to be used.\n\n4.15 \nIn some cases, it may be difficult to define requirements, especially where \nthe outputs can be delivered in various ways or a solution needs to be provided by \nthe supply market. One way to ensure delivery of the desired quality is to define \ntechnical requirements through output specifications, rather than by referring to \nstandards. This might include a description of the outputs required (for example, \nquantity, level, speed), the performance standards to be achieved, and/or the \ndelivery schedule.\n\nOutput specifications are inevitable in the case of innovative or high-level \n\n4.16 \ntechnologies, and may be preferred in any event in other cases, since they allow \nbidders to offer solutions against an output to be achieved (by whatever means \nthey are able), rather than restricting them to static characteristics that may or may \nnot offer the best VFM.\n\n\f16\n\nQuality\n\n4.17 \nThe benefit of using output specifications is that it helps in introducing \nmore objectivity during the evaluation process. Using output specifications may \nalso avoid conscious or unconscious bias toward certain contractors by specifying \ngoods or service characteristics, materials, production processes, or technology \nsolutions that only certain contractors can provide may also be avoided by using \noutput specifications. Likewise, proprietary solutions should be avoided to the \nextent possible and the market assessments can provide more guidance on this.\n\n4.18 \nMore information on output specifications and life cycle approaches are \ndiscussed in the Guidance Note on Value for Money and the Guidance Note on High-\nLevel Technology.\n\nPerformance measures distort contractor behavior and competition. \n\n4.19 \nAn important part of developing bidding documents is the development of \nperformance measures (often referred to as \u201cperformance indicators\u201d or \u201ckey \nperformance indicators\u201d). Performance measures reflect what is important to \nthe borrower, enable the borrower to measure and monitor progress and ongoing \nperformance over the life of the contract, and send a signal to the contractor about \nthe most important things to achieve when delivering the contract.\n\nHowever, performance measures can distort contractor behavior by \n4.20 \nfocusing the contractor only on achieving the performance measures, to the \nexclusion of other aspects of performance\u2014for example, focusing on reducing cost \nat the expense of quality. Poorly crafted or overly rigid performance measures may \nalso dissuade contractors from participating in the bid.\n\n4.21 \n\nThere are various means to mitigate this risk:\n\n(i)  A range of performance measures across different aspects of \n\nperformance (often referred to as a \u201cbalanced scorecard\u201d) can \nbe used to ensure that the contractor\u2019s focus is not too narrow. \nA\u00a0balanced scorecard usually includes measures in the areas of safety, \ncost, quality, schedule, and client satisfaction.\n\n(ii)  Contracts will specify key performance indicators, but other (non-\n\nkey) performance indicators can be specified and measured during \ncontract management, as a means of ensuring various aspects of \nquality are being addressed by the contractor.\n\n(iii)  The ability to periodically review and adjust performance measures \n\ncan be written into the contract, to enable measures that are causing \nundesired behaviors to be changed as required or additional measures \nto be specified. \n\nCompensation model distorts contractor behavior and competition. \n\n4.22 \nCompensation in a contract comprises the pricing arrangement and any incentives \nand/or penalties. The pricing structure can strongly drive contractor behavior in \nboth desired and undesired ways. For example, a unit rate price for performance of \na certain task can provide the borrower with surety that the total cost of a contract \ncan be controlled via the specification of the volume of units. The risk is that the \ncontractor is incentivized to perform the minimum amount of work to complete the \ntask to maximize profitability, which can potentially affect the quality of the results.\n\n\fDesign and Bidding Document Preparation\n\n17\n\n4.23  Mitigating measures include\n\n(i)  analysis of potential positive and negative contractor behaviors at the \ntime of design of the pricing structure, and alteration of the structure \nas required;\nincluding quality performance measures to counteract pricing \nstructures that may incentivize reduced effort;\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii)  open-book pricing and fixed profit percentages to reduce the \n\nincentive to maximize profits; and\n\n(iv)  payments for achievement of milestones to encourage progress. \n\nHowever, these mitigating measures may also drive undesired behaviors that should \nbe considered prior to implementation, e.g., a focus solely on contract activities that \nlink to the achievement of the payment milestones at the expense of other, less \nclosely linked activities.\n\nIncentives and penalties (if permitted) can have an even stronger effect \n\n4.24 \non contractor behavior. Incentive payments may result in pure profit for the \ncontractor over the base profit assumed when the contractor priced the contract. \nIncentives can lead to excessive effort being applied by the contractor to achieving \nthe incentive at the expense of the output and quality of the base services.\n\n4.25  Mitigating measures include\n\n(i)  excluding incentives and penalties from the contract;\n(ii) \n\nlinking incentives and penalties to \u201cbalanced scorecard\u201d performance, \nrather than to individual performance measures; and\n\n(iii)  in the case of certain incentive mechanisms, linking payments to \n\nimplemented improvement initiatives, rather than just improvement \nideas, or linking payments to booked (accounting) improvements for \nthe borrower or end user resulting from the improvement initiative \nrather than the generation, or even implementation, of improvement \ninitiatives. \n\n2. \n\nengineering design issues\n\nInaccurate translation of requirements into written design. The \n\n4.26 \ntranslation of requirements into detailed engineering design documents, such \nas technical drawings and specifications, can sometimes fail to meet the original \nrequirements.\n\n4.27  Mitigating measures include the following:\n\n(i)  Explicitly document the requirements at the outset of the project to \nensure internal alignment and to use as a standard against which the \ndesign\u2019s effectiveness and accuracy can be measured.\n\n(ii)  Include design \u201cstage-gates\u201d requiring that a steering committee or \n\noverseeing body review and approve the design at predetermined \nstages.\n\n\f18\n\nQuality\n\n(iii)  Use a technical expert (e.g., a consultant) employed by the borrower \n\nto independently review the design.\n\n(iv)  Make the designer liable for any costs incurred from design changes \n\ndue to design faults. \n\nInsufficient detail in design leading to misinterpretation by contractor. \n\n4.28 \nEngineering designs may provide a level of detail that requires interpretation and \ndevelopment of solutions by the contractor. This may be a conscious choice, \nknowing that experienced contractors have the capability to implement solutions \nat the detailed level. In other cases, a lack of sufficient detail may not be intentional, \nresulting in contractors misinterpreting intent.\n\n4.29  Mitigating measures include the following:\n\n(i)  Assess the implementation supply market capability prior to \n\ndetermining the level of detail required in the design.\n\n(ii)  Use standards and standard specifications to govern the quality \n\naspects not detailed in the design.\n\n(iii)  Use a bundled \u201cdesign and build\u201d approach, rather than separate \n\ncontracts for design and implementation.\n\n(iv)  Use a collaborative approach, where the implementation contractor is \n\ninvolved in the design development phase. \n\n4.30 \nDespecification to reduce costs. This is a particular problem for large-\nscale projects. A shortage of funds available for infrastructure development, for \nexample, often leads to a preference to award based on the lowest bid. In addition, \ncost-cutting measures may be employed at the design stage to reduce project \ncost. This can result in a higher-than-expected overall cost due to the lack of \nconsideration of operation and maintenance costs, long-term durability, safety \n(including resilience to natural disasters), or environmental factors. In the case of \nhigh-level technology projects, the high costs associated with technology failure \nmay outweigh the initial purchase costs.\n\n4.31 \n\nMitigation measures include the following:\n\n(i)  Review the specification using structured \u201cvalue engineering\u201d \n\nmethodologies, whereby descoping decisions are made in light of \nconsiderations of what aspects of the design are valuable to the \nborrower.\n\n(ii)  Consider the total cost of ownership, i.e., the determination of the \n\nimpacts of descoping decisions on the total life cycle cost of the \npurchase (including construction, operation, maintenance, and \ndisposal costs).\n\n(iii)  Conduct an \u201coperability\u201d review of the design by an expert consultant \nor independent contractor to advise on the impacts of descoping \ndecisions on the operability and maintainability of the outputs of \nthe\u00a0contract.\n\n\fV.\u2003bid evaluation and Contract award\n\nA.  \n\nContribution to Quality\n\n The bid evaluation and contract award stages of the procurement cycle \n\n5.1 \noffer further opportunities to ensure the procurement process delivers quality \noutcomes. The criteria used to evaluate bids and the methodology for selecting a \nbidder for award of contract need to be aligned with the desired characteristics of \nthe contractor and the desired outcomes of the contract.\n\nB.  \n\nPotential Issues Affecting Quality\n\n5.2 \nPotential issues that can affect quality arise in the design of evaluation \ncriteria, in the evaluation process itself, and in the methodology used to select a \nbidder for contract award (Table 4). Good procurement practice is generally the \nbest way of mitigating against the risks of poor quality during these stages of the \nprocurement process.\n\nTable 4: Issues Affecting Quality in the Bid Evaluation and  \nContract Award\u00a0Stages\n\nActivity\n\nEvaluation criteria\n\nPotential Issues Affecting Quality\n\n\u2022\tEvaluation criteria not aligned with desired contractor characteristics\n\u2022\tContractor bid response format does not elicit information \n\n\u2022\tQuality criteria specified cannot be measured objectively and may \n\nsupporting the evaluation criteria\n\nbe prone to abuse of discretion\n\nEvaluation process\n\n\u2022\tDifficulty in measuring if contractor meets criteria\n\u2022\tEvaluation of nonprice factors influenced by pricing information\n\nContract award\n\n\u2022\tMethodology for ranking contractor evaluations insufficiently \n\n\u2022\tInflexible selection processes may result in awarding contracts to \n\nweights quality\n\nabnormally low bids\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\n\f20\n\nQuality\n\nC.   Mitigating Measures\n\n1. \n\nevaluation Criteria issues\n\n5.3 \nEvaluation criteria not aligned with desired contractor characteristics. \nThis creates the risk of unsuitable contractors being selected, ultimately affecting \nthe quality of the contract outcomes. A methodology to mitigate this risk is to use \nwhat might be called an \u201cevaluation logic chain\u201d to link performance objectives with \nevaluation criteria, and ultimately with questions asked of bidders in the bidding \ndocuments. \n\n5.4 \nFigure 3 describes an example. It illustrates how following this series of \nsteps can ensure that evaluation criteria directly relate to the desired contractor \ncharacteristics which, in turn, directly relate to the performance objectives.\n\nContractor bid response format does not elicit information supporting \n\n5.5 \nthe evaluation criteria. While the desired contractor characteristics may be clear \nand linked to performance objectives and the contract outcomes, the questions \nasked of bidders in the bidding documents need to directly relate to the evaluation \ncriteria. Otherwise, the bid responses will be difficult to score against the criteria.\n\nThe evaluation logic chain approach can be used to mitigate this risk. \n\n5.6 \nQuestions can be developed for bidding documents that directly elicit information \nthat will be effective in determining the contractor\u2019s score against the evaluation \ncriteria and can be shown through this approach to directly relate to contract \nperformance objectives. If personnel in the borrower\u2019s organization suggest \nquestions to be asked of bidders that do not relate to performance objectives, \neither disallow the question or revisit the contract outcomes and performance \nobjectives.\n\nQuality criteria specified cannot be measured objectively.\u00a0Depending \n\n5.7 \non the goods, works, or services being procured, criteria used to evaluate the \ncontractor\u2019s ability to meet quality requirements may be clearly objective \n(e.g.,\u00a0dimensional tolerances for manufactured goods) or subjective (e.g.,\u00a0the \nprovision of services and technology products).\n\n5.8 \ndetermined by seeking information on\n\nIn the case of services, the quality capabilities of contractors can be \n\n(i)  past performance;\n(ii)  the proposed quality management plan and quality assurance \n\nmeasures for the services; and\n\n(iii)  the robustness of quality management processes within the \n\ncontractor\u2019s organization (evidenced through quality certification, \nquality management systems, stated quality policy, and quality \nprocedures). \n\n\fBid Evaluation and Contract Award\n\n21\n\nFigure 3: Example Evaluation Logic Chain\n\nPerformance \nObjective\n\nCompliance with \nspecification\n\nDesired \nContractor \nCharacteristic\n\nContractor has \nthe capability and \nmethodology to \nperform services to \nthe specification\n\nBid Evaluation \nCriteria\n\nDegree to which \nthe proposed \nmethodology to \nperform services \nmeets desired \noutcomes\n\nDegree of experience \nin performing similar \nservices\n\nrisks are managed\n\nContractor has \nwell developed \nrisk management \ncapability\n\nSophistication of \nrisk management \nprocesses and systems\n\nQuality requirements \nare\u00a0met\n\nContractor has \nmanagement \nprocesses and systems \nthat will ensure quality\n\nAdequacy of \nmanagement \nprocesses and systems \napplied to the services\n\nEvidence of \nexperience in \nmanaging quality of \nservices\n\nContract is \ncompleted without \ndisruption\n\nContractor is \nfinancially solvent\n\nFinancial viability of \ncontractor\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\nrequirements \nin Bidding \nDocuments\n\n\u2022\t Provide your \nproposed \nmethodology \nto perform the \nservices\n\n\u2022\t Provide a list \n\nof projects you \nhave completed \nfor other clients \nsimilar in nature \nto the services\n\n\u2022\t Provide \n\ncurriculum vitae \nof key personnel \nwho will perform \nthe services\n\n\u2022\t Describe your \n\nrisk management \nprocesses and \nsystems\n\u2022\t Provide a \n\npreliminary risk \nplan for the \nservices\n\n\u2022\t Provide \n\ninformation \nabout any quality \nmanagement \nsystem \ncertifications you \nhave\n\n\u2022\t Provide a quality \nmanagement \nplan for the \nservices\n\n\u2022\t Provide \n\nexample quality \nmanagement \nplans you have \napplied to \nprevious projects \nfor other clients\n\n\u2022\t Provide audited \nstatements of \naccount of your \ncompany over \nthe last 3 years\n\u2022\t Provide a credit \nreference from \nyour bank\n\n\f22\n\nQuality\n\nOther contractor attributes that affect the quality of contract outputs can \n\n5.9 \ninclude such factors as capital requirements, availability of plant and equipment, \nand evidence of managerial and technical capacity. In the case of innovative or \nhigh-level technology projects, additional criteria such as the bidder\u2019s reputation, \nabilities on complex projects, and internal processes may need to be considered \n(tailored to the specific project risks). The Guidance Note on High-Level Technology \nhas further details.\n\n5.10 \nSince evaluation of these criteria can be subjective, objectivity in \nevaluation can be improved by having multiple evaluators assessing bid responses \nusing a scoring system, with scores defined using score descriptors. During the \nprocurement risk assessment, any risks of subjectivity, bias, and potential abuse of \ndiscretion must be carefully considered, and suitable mitigation measures adopted.\n\nTable 5 gives an example for the evaluation of bidders\u2019 quality\u00a0management \n\n5.11 \nand continuous improvement capabilities. The scoring system assigns a score \nbetween 0 and 5 for responses to questions in the bidding documents related \nto the evaluation criterion. The score descriptors provide a benchmark against \nwhich a panel of evaluators can score bid responses. The score descriptors should \nbe written prior to the receipt of bids and preferably prior to issuing the bidding \ndocuments. While there is still a degree of subjectivity in this approach, the use of \nmultiple evaluators, who may be required to agree on consensus scores after scoring \nresponses individually, instills greater objectivity into the evaluation.\n\n2. \n\nevaluation Process issues\n\nDifficulty in measuring if contractor meets criteria. Even if using \n\n5.12 \nobjectively measurable quality criteria, there is still a degree of uncertainty around \nthe evaluation of whether a contractor meets these criteria, because the evaluation \ndepends largely on information provided by the contractor.\n\n5.13 \nTo improve the accuracy of the evaluation of contractor quality, \nobjective evidence supporting claimed performance on past projects or services \ncan be required of bidders. In addition, borrowers may rely on data contained in \ntheir systems to measure past performance, provided these are objective and \nnondiscriminatory.\n\n5.14 \nconfidence in the quality capabilities of contractors, including\n\nSeveral common procurement practices can also be employed to improve \n\n(i)  checking the references provided by the contractor, from past clients \n\nfor whom they have provided similar goods, works, or services;\n(ii)  requiring contractors to provide sample quality management plans \n\nand quality results from recent assignments; and\n\n(iii)  seeking information on how a \u201cquality culture\u201d exists in the \n\ncontractor\u2019s organization, for example, the knowledge of contractor \nstaff on aspects of their quality management policy and procedures.

contracts or high-level technology, where quality is important, \n\n5.15 \nprequalification of contractors on the basis of capacity, capability, and quality may \nbe advisable.\n\n5.16 \nPreregistration of contractors for the supply of certain types of goods, \nworks, or services may be a time-effective means of ensuring that checking of \nquality capabilities does not extend the procurement process time for individual \nprocurements, and provides a \u201cbench\u201d of suitable contractors. However, \npreregistration must not override ineligibility to participate, and must not be used as \nan alternative to prequalification for a particular contract under open competitive \nbidding.\n\n5.17 \nEvaluation of nonprice factors influenced by pricing information. One \nrisk in the evaluation process is that exposure of evaluators to pricing information \nprior to evaluating nonprice information may introduce bias toward evaluating \nlower-priced contractors more favorably.\n\n5.18 \nThis risk can be mitigated through the use of two-envelope bidding \nprocedures, requiring bidders to submit pricing information separately from \nnonprice (technical) information, and for the evaluation panel to evaluate the \nnonprice information before the pricing information. The Guidance Note on Open \nCompetitive Bidding has further details on different bidding procedures.\n\n3. \n\nContractor selection issues\n\nMethodology for ranking contractor evaluations insufficiently weights \n\n5.19 \nquality. When quality is an important consideration in contractor selection, a \nmethodology for ranking and selecting bidders is necessary, based on a balance \nof quality; cost; and other desired characteristics such as safety performance, \ncapability, and capacity. This is commonly achieved by applying percentage \nweightings to the evaluation criteria in proportion to their importance to the \nachievement of contract outcomes, and totaling 100%.\n\nVFM is one of the core ADB procurement principles and this is \n5.20 \nintegrated into all procurement governed by the 2017 procurement regulations. \nA common VFM ranking methodology involves dividing the weighted nonprice \nscore of a bidder\u2019s response, obtained from the nonprice evaluation, into the \nbidder\u2019s weighted submitted bid price. The resulting VFM calculation can then be \nrepresented visually as illustrated in the example in Figure 4. \n\nQuality may be of such criticality that it is desirable to weight quality \n\n5.21 \nhigher than price. In these cases, the calculation method should be stated prior \nto issuing bids. It is recommended that the bidding documents also include the \nrespective weightings, to emphasize to prospective bidders the relative importance \nof the various factors. Where quality is given a high weighting, the borrower \nneeds to ensure that evaluation criteria and the scoring system are conducted as \nobjectively as possible.\n\n\fBid Evaluation and Contract Award\n\n25\n\nFigure 4: Example Value for Money Assessment\n\nHigh price\u2013High quality\n\nLow price\u2013High quality\n\nSupplier A\n\nHighest \nValue for \nMoney\n\nSupplier B\n\nHigh price\u2013Low quality\n\nLow price\u2013Low quality\n\n \n\nE\nR\nO\nC\nS\nE\nC\nI\nR\nP\nN\nO\nN\n\nH\nG\nH\n\nI\n\nW\nO\nL\n\nSupplier C\n\nSupplier D\n\nHIGH\n\nLOW\n\nPRICE\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\n5.22 \nInflexible selection processes may result in contract award to an \nabnormally low bid. In evaluating bids, it may be found that some bids have \nabnormally low pricing compared to the spread of pricing among other bids, the \nborrower\u2019s initial estimate, or to prevailing market conditions. This may indicate \na misinterpretation of requirements by the bidder or a deliberate decision to \ncompromise quality to win the contract. An inflexible evaluation and selection \nprocess may require that the lowest priced bidder is awarded the contract, risking an \nabnormally low bid winning the contract, which may compromise quality outcomes. \n\nTo mitigate this risk, the bidding documents should include the ability \n\n5.23 \nto seek explanations for, to increase the performance security of, and, ultimately, \nto reject bids that are unbalanced or abnormally low. The Guidance Note on \nAbnormally Low Bids has further information on how to deal with abnormally \nlow\u00a0bids.\n\n\fVi.\u2003implementation and  \nContract Management\n\nA.  \n\nContribution to Quality\n\n6.1 \nContract management plays a vital role in contributing to quality \noutcomes. Active measurement and monitoring of process measures and outputs \ninforms the contractor and borrower on whether the contract objectives are on \ntrack or are at risk of not being achieved. This allows rectification when certain \nmilestones are not being met, thus improving the likelihood that desired outcomes \nare obtained.\n\nB.  \n\nPotential Issues Affecting Quality\n\n6.2 \ncycle that affect quality (Table 6) can be categorized into the activities of\n\nPotential issues in the contract management stage of the procurement \n\n(i)  performance measurement,\n(ii)  relationship management,\n(iii)  contract change management, and\n(iv)  contract closure.\n\nTable 6: Issues Affecting Quality in the Implementation and \nContract\u00a0Management Stage\n\nActivity\n\nPerformance \nmeasurement\n\nRelationship \nmanagement\n\nContract change \nmanagement\n\nPotential Issues Affecting Quality\n\n\u2022\tPerformance measures not aligned with contract objectives\n\u2022\tIncorrectly designed performance measures\n\u2022\tInattention to performance measurement and monitoring\n\n\u2022\tAdversarial relationship affects capacity to jointly address quality \n\nissues\n\n\u2022\tRelationship structure not clearly defined\n\u2022\tInadequate contract administration corrodes relationship\n\n\u2022\tContract objectives or scope change over the course of contract\n\nContract closure\n\n\u2022\tMishandling of contract expiry or termination\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\n\fImplementation and Contract Management\n\n27\n\nC.   Mitigating Measures\n\n1. \n\nPerformance Measurement issues\n\nPerformance measures not aligned with contract objectives. This can \n\n6.3 \noccur because performance measures are not defined at the time that the contract \nspecification and bidding documents were written, or because performance \nmeasures were defined by the contract manager after the contract has been \nawarded, without having a clear view of the contract objectives.\n\n6.4 \n\nMitigating measures include the following:\n\n(i)  Develop performance measures at the time of writing the \nspecification and include them in the bidding documents.\n\n(ii)  Test all performance measures to ensure that they contribute to the \n\ncontract objectives.\n\n(iii)  Develop a contract management plan (CMP) prior to contract award, \nclearly setting out the performance measures, which should also have \nbeen included in the contract (refer to the Guidance Note on Contract \nManagement for further details). \n\nIncorrectly designed performance measures. Performance measures \n\n6.5 \nthat are not specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) \ncan be ineffective (e.g., if they are not measurable), or at worst, can inhibit the \nachievement of contract outcomes (e.g., if they are not relevant to contract \nobjectives). The Guidance Note on Contract Management has more information on \nkey performance indicators.\n\nInattention to performance measurement and monitoring. Where \n6.6 \ninsufficient effort or resourcing is applied to contract management, including \nperformance measurement and monitoring, the level of quality may gradually \ndecrease. Borrowers should plan to resource the management of contracts in \naccordance with their value, criticality, and risk. For highly critical contracts, the \nborrower should be prepared to invest in a more formal, multilevel relationship \nstructure, which may include a relationship steering committee. The relationship \nstructure and reporting expectations should be set out in the CMP.\n\n2. \n\nrelationship Management issues\n\nAdversarial relationship affects capacity to jointly address quality \n\n6.7 \nissues. The nature of the relationship between the contractor and the borrower can \nvary depending on the nature of the goods, works, or services and how strategically \ncritical they are to the borrower. A more transactional relationship may be \nappropriate for the supply of commodities, while a high-value, high-risk project that \nis of strategic importance to the borrower will be more successful if the relationship \nis collaborative. If the relationship starts or becomes adversarial, it would likely \naffect the degree to which collaboration can occur and the resulting value that can \nbe obtained from the contract.\n\n\f28\n\nQuality\n\n6.8 \nThe risk of the relationship becoming adversarial can be mitigated by \nhaving clear contract objectives communicated to the contractor, performance \nmeasures that reflect the contract objectives, a clear relationship structure that is \nappropriately resourced, and clearly defined dispute management mechanisms. \nAll\u00a0of this should be documented in the CMP.\n\n6.9 \nover reporting lines and the means for raising and escalating disputes.\n\nrelationship structure not clearly defined. This can create confusion \n\n6.10 \nThis can be mitigated by specifying a fit-for-purpose relationship \nstructure in the contract and the CMP. The Guidance Note on Contract Management \nhas more information.\n\nInadequate contract administration corrodes relationship. While a \n\n6.11 \nwell-defined and -resourced relationship structure is important to successful \ncontract management, the relationship can be corroded by inadequate contract \nadministration.\n\nThe contract manager needs to pay attention to ensuring payments to the \n\n6.12 \ncontractor are made on time and that records management is kept up to date, so \nthat the status of the contract and administrative matters are clear at all times.\n\n3. \n\nContract Change Management issues\n\nContract objectives or scope change over the course of contract. It is \n\n6.13 \nnormal for changes to occur to the scope of a contract and the contract objectives \nover the course of a contract. Quality can be affected where those changes are not \nclearly communicated and managed. In some cases, the changes can be so great \nthat the contractor may not have the skills, capability, or capacity to implement the \nrevised scope.\n\nThe Guidance Note on Contract Management provides advice on how \n6.14 \ncontract changes should be managed. If the changes are so significant that the \ncontractor may not be able to deliver, consider closing the current contract and \nprocuring a new one.\n\n4. \n\nContract Closure issues\n\nMishandling of contract expiry or termination. Contracts can end \n6.15 \nbecause the contract objectives have been achieved and the work completed, \nthe\u00a0work is no longer required or has significantly changed, or there was a breach \nof\u00a0contract or performance issues. \n\nIn each case, the contract closure and transition needs to be managed \n\n6.16 \nto avoid adverse outcomes. Risks associated with contract expiry and termination \nshould have been considered during procurement planning and contract \nmanagement planning, and contingency plans put in place appropriate to the \ncriticality of the contract.\n\n\fappendix: Quality Checklist\n\nQuality needs to be considered at all stages of the procurement cycle to \n\nA1 \nensure project objectives are achieved. The checklist in the table below is intended \nto provide procurement practitioners with a list of items to consider at each \nkey stage of the procurement cycle, to ensure quality is being incorporated into \ndecisions made about the procurement process. These items are not a complete \nlist, and the procurement practitioner should consider other aspects that may \naffect quality that are particular to the procurement of these items. \n\nQuality Checklist\n\nYes (\u221a) \nor No \n(X)\n\nMitigation Measure\n\nItem\n\nProcurement Planning\n\nAre the project and contract \nobjectives and requirements \nclear?\n\nAre the project and contract \nobjectives clearly stated in \nthe procurement plan and are \nstakeholders aligned?\n\nAre the borrower\u2019s capability \nand capacity sufficient to \nensure a fair and quality \nprocurement process that \nis free from risks of abuse or \nbias?\n\nDo suitably qualified \ncontractors exist in the \ngeographical market or market \nsector?\n\nDoes the market analysis \nindicate that the power of \ncontractors is such that quality \nmay be compromised?\n\n\u2022\tEnsure that clear project and contract objectives \nand requirements have been provided by the \nborrower or have been validated by the borrower.\n\n\u2022\tEnsure that the procurement plan and, \n\nspecifically, the project and contract objectives \nhave been reviewed and validated by \nstakeholders.\n\n\u2022\tSeek support from external procurement \n\nconsultants or bring in additional procurement \nsupport.\n\n\u2022\tExpand the market analysis to other countries or \n\nrelated market sectors.\n\n\u2022\tWork with the contractor on improving their \n\ncapability, e.g., through industry associations or \nother private sector interventions.\n\n\u2022\tBuild incentives and penalties into the contract \n\nlinked to quality measures.\n\n\u2022\tBroaden the supply base to increase competition.\n\u2022\tDevelop industry capability.\n\u2022\tInsource the requirement.\n\ncontinued on next page\n\n\fDesign and Bidding Document Preparation\n\n30\n\nAppendix\n\nQuality Checklist continued\n\nItem\n\nHas a comprehensive risk \nassessment been completed \nthat includes fit-for-purpose \nand integrity-related issues?\n\nIs the proposed procurement \nstrategy appropriate and will \nit promote the achievement \nof project and contract \nobjectives?\n\nAre the project requirements \naccurately reflected in the \nspecification (or design) and \ndo they support an objective \nevaluation process?\n\nHave the performance \nmeasures (i.e., key \nperformance indicators) \nstated in the proposed \ncontract been analyzed \nfor impacts on contractor \nbehavior and competition?\n\nHas the compensation \nmodel (pricing structure, \nand incentives or penalties) \nbeen analyzed for impacts on \ncontractor behavior?\n\nIf the requirements \nare incorporated into a \ndesign document, is there \nsufficient detail to avoid \nmisinterpretation by the \ncontractor?\n\nYes (\u221a) \nor No \n(X)\n\nMitigation Measure\n\n\u2022\tComplete a risk assessment.\n\n\u2022\tDocument the selected procurement strategy \nand validate with procurement managers and \nstakeholders.\n\n\u2022\tValidate the requirements with stakeholders.\n\u2022\tConsider incorporating some of the following, \n\nas\u00a0appropriate:\n \u2013 quality assurance mechanisms (e.g., testing and \n\ninspection);\n \u2013 warranties;\n \u2013 defect liability clauses;\n \u2013 functional guarantees;\n \u2013 performance securities;\n \u2013 insurances;

This note also contains a checklist of items that \nmay be considered by the procurement practitioner to ensure that quality is integrated \ninto the decisions made during the procurement process. Improvement in the quality \nof procurement decision-making and support will increase efficiency, reduce risk and \nprocurement time, and ensure value for money in ADB-supported projects.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its \ndeveloping member countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their \npeople. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to a large share of the \nworld\u2019s poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic \ngrowth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, \nequity investments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\n\nasian deVeloPMent bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["QUALITY\nGUIDANCE NOTE ON PROCUREMENT\n", "JUNE 2018\n", "ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n", "   Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0  \n  IGO license (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 IGO) \n", "\u00a9 2018 Asian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City, 1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nTel +63 2 632 4444; Fax +63 2 636 2444\nwww.adb.org\n", "Some rights reserved.
