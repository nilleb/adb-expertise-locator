Fuel con-\nsumption for every ton-kilometer of freight carried is only 15% of that\nby road and 54% of that by rail. The emissions (except SO2) also are\nmuch lower than in rail or road transport. Coastal shipping is also more\nsuited to handling bulky consignments. Coast-to-coast carriage of goods\nby coastal shipping costs 21% that by road and 42% that by rail.1\n\nIndia  has  a  coastline  of  around  7500  km  and  a  number  of  major\nand minor ports. An optimal mix of road, rail, inland water transport,\nand  coastal  shipping  will  provide  an  efficient  transport  infrastructure\nwith mobility, flexibility, and energy and cost efficiency.\n\nRoad  transport  has  an  edge  over  rail  or  water  transport  because\nmost of the production and consumption centers are landlocked. Also,\nit  provides  door-to-door  movement.  Over  the  years,  there  has  been\nsubstantial  investment  in  its  infrastructure.  Coastal  shipping,  on  the\nother hand, involves double-handling costs. Lack of policy measures to\npromote coastal shipping is another reason why it accounts for only 7%\n\n1 TCS (Tata Consultancy Services), Study on Development of Coastal Shipping\nand Minor Ports, prepared for Government of India, Ministry of Shipping, December\n2003.\n\n\fof domestic cargo movement.

Ultimately,  however,  this  depends  on  growth  in\ncargo. Hence, both issues need to be addressed together.\n\nAlong with their development it is necessary to provide for connec-\ntivity of minor ports with the road and rail network. Ports like Pipavav\nlanguished for lack of connectivity; the Pipavav\u2013Surendranagar rail link\nwas established in joint venture with Indian Railways. It is understood that\nphase 3 of the National Highway Development Program would provide\nfor  connectivity  to  the  minor  ports;  this  needs  to  be  accorded  high\npriority.\n\nCustom-designed Vessels\nCustom-designed Vessels\nCustom-designed Vessels\nCustom-designed Vessels\nCustom-designed Vessels\n\nIt is also necessary to customize roll-on-roll-off (Ro-Ro) vessels, silo\nvessels,  etc.  to  facilitate  the  movement  of  trucks  over  long  distances\nand cargo like cement and foodgrains. Konkan Railways has demonstrated\nthat Ro-Ro wagons can effectively reduce movement by road; Gujarat\nAmbuja Cement moves significant quantities of cement in silo vessels.\n\nSimilarly, the use of catamarans and hovercraft to move passengers,\nfor example from Mumbai to Navi Mumbai and between cities on the\nKonkan  coast  needs  to  be  encouraged.  The  Shipping  Corporation  of\nIndia  (SCI)  used  to  run  a  passenger  ship  between  Mumbai  and  Goa,\nbut no longer. Specific origin and destinations (O-D) need to be identified\nfor the transportation of passengers through coastal vessels.\n\nEnabling Legislation\nEnabling Legislation\nEnabling Legislation\nEnabling Legislation\nEnabling Legislation\n\nThe  Merchant  Shipping  Act,  1958,  deals  both  with  oceangoing\nvessels and coastal ships and sets equal standards and norms for both.\nThe  Pinto  Committee  recommended  enactment  of  legislation  to  deal\nexclusively with coastal shipping. A follow-up committee was constituted\nin 1998. Government should now move forward on the matter.\n\nCargo Potential\nCargo Potential\nCargo Potential\nCargo Potential\nCargo Potential\n\nTCS projections for coastal traffic are for an increase from 54 million\ntons  (MT)  in  2001-2  to  83.28  MT  in  2006-7  and  107.08  MT  in\n2011-12.  TCS  has  further  studied  the  economics  of  cargo  diversion\nusing certain criteria of land and sea distances between different O-D\nlocations, quantity of goods, and cargo categories. Handling costs, bunker\ncosts, standing costs, port tariffs, land movement costs, inventory costs,\nand external costs have been taken into reckoning. The study indicates\n\nthat  diversion  is  viable  in  68%  of  the  cases.  For  instance,  for  a  total\nland lead <50 km and sea distance <500 km, transportation by sea\nfor some O-D pairs is financially viable compared to transportation by\nroad. Similarly, for a total land lead <50 km and sea distance 500\u2013\n1000 km it was viable for steel sheets and coils; but for sponge iron\nand pig iron carriage by rail was more economical. The cargo projections\nare for commodities traditionally moved through coastal shipping and\ndo not seem to include commodities like cars and other high-value low-\nvolume items and trucks through Ro-Ro vessels. These findings should\ntherefore be treated as indicative.\n\nThe study indicates that handling cost, charter hire cost, port dues,\nand  bunker  costs  make  up  the  major  portion  of  the  cost  of  coastal\ntransportation.  Handling  costs  range  between  35  and  50%,  charter\nhire  between  20  and  33%,  port  dues  between  10  and  20%,  and\nbunker  costs  between  13  and  30%.  Coastal  shipping  can  be  made\nviable  through  reduction  especially  in  handling  costs  and  charter  hire\ncost.  With  the  development  of  coastal  shipping  and  minor  ports,  a\nvessel should be encouraged to call at more than one port.

Ultimately,  however,  this  depends  on  growth  in\ncargo. Hence, both issues need to be addressed together.\n\nAlong with their development it is necessary to provide for connec-\ntivity of minor ports with the road and rail network. Ports like Pipavav\nlanguished for lack of connectivity; the Pipavav\u2013Surendranagar rail link\nwas established in joint venture with Indian Railways. It is understood that\nphase 3 of the National Highway Development Program would provide\nfor  connectivity  to  the  minor  ports;  this  needs  to  be  accorded  high\npriority.\n\nCustom-designed Vessels\nCustom-designed Vessels\nCustom-designed Vessels\nCustom-designed Vessels\nCustom-designed Vessels\n\nIt is also necessary to customize roll-on-roll-off (Ro-Ro) vessels, silo\nvessels,  etc.  to  facilitate  the  movement  of  trucks  over  long  distances\nand cargo like cement and foodgrains. Konkan Railways has demonstrated\nthat Ro-Ro wagons can effectively reduce movement by road; Gujarat\nAmbuja Cement moves significant quantities of cement in silo vessels.\n\nSimilarly, the use of catamarans and hovercraft to move passengers,\nfor example from Mumbai to Navi Mumbai and between cities on the\nKonkan  coast  needs  to  be  encouraged.  The  Shipping  Corporation  of\nIndia  (SCI)  used  to  run  a  passenger  ship  between  Mumbai  and  Goa,\nbut no longer. Specific origin and destinations (O-D) need to be identified\nfor the transportation of passengers through coastal vessels.\n\nEnabling Legislation\nEnabling Legislation\nEnabling Legislation\nEnabling Legislation\nEnabling Legislation\n\nThe  Merchant  Shipping  Act,  1958,  deals  both  with  oceangoing\nvessels and coastal ships and sets equal standards and norms for both.\nThe  Pinto  Committee  recommended  enactment  of  legislation  to  deal\nexclusively with coastal shipping. A follow-up committee was constituted\nin 1998. Government should now move forward on the matter.\n\nCargo Potential\nCargo Potential\nCargo Potential\nCargo Potential\nCargo Potential\n\nTCS projections for coastal traffic are for an increase from 54 million\ntons  (MT)  in  2001-2  to  83.28  MT  in  2006-7  and  107.08  MT  in\n2011-12.  TCS  has  further  studied  the  economics  of  cargo  diversion\nusing certain criteria of land and sea distances between different O-D\nlocations, quantity of goods, and cargo categories. Handling costs, bunker\ncosts, standing costs, port tariffs, land movement costs, inventory costs,\nand external costs have been taken into reckoning. The study indicates\n\nthat  diversion  is  viable  in  68%  of  the  cases.  For  instance,  for  a  total\nland lead <50 km and sea distance <500 km, transportation by sea\nfor some O-D pairs is financially viable compared to transportation by\nroad. Similarly, for a total land lead <50 km and sea distance 500\u2013\n1000 km it was viable for steel sheets and coils; but for sponge iron\nand pig iron carriage by rail was more economical. The cargo projections\nare for commodities traditionally moved through coastal shipping and\ndo not seem to include commodities like cars and other high-value low-\nvolume items and trucks through Ro-Ro vessels. These findings should\ntherefore be treated as indicative.\n\nThe study indicates that handling cost, charter hire cost, port dues,\nand  bunker  costs  make  up  the  major  portion  of  the  cost  of  coastal\ntransportation.  Handling  costs  range  between  35  and  50%,  charter\nhire  between  20  and  33%,  port  dues  between  10  and  20%,  and\nbunker  costs  between  13  and  30%.  Coastal  shipping  can  be  made\nviable  through  reduction  especially  in  handling  costs  and  charter  hire\ncost.  With  the  development  of  coastal  shipping  and  minor  ports,  a\nvessel should be encouraged to call at more than one port.

It  is  understood\nthat the Netherlands provides a fiscal incentive equivalent to the freight\ncost incurred in coastal transport. Similarly, government should consider\nallowing a credit of say about 150% of actual freight cost in calculating\nthe taxable income of the consignor company on the lines of the tax\nbenefit provided for research and development in the automobile industry\nin  the  recent  budget.  The  loss  of  revenue  to  government  would  be\nmore  than  offset  by  the  savings  in  cost  of  oil  imports  and  in  overall\nexternal  costs.  There  could  be  misuse  of  this  concession  but  if  it  is\nlimited to bulk cargo like coal, fertilizers, iron ore, etc. the beneficiaries\nwould be large corporate entities who are subject to audit.\n\n8 Policy Brief No. 14\n\n\fADB\n\nINRM Policy Brief No. 14\n\nBottlenecks in the Growth of\nBottlenecks in the Growth of\nBottlenecks in the Growth of\nBottlenecks in the Growth of\nBottlenecks in the Growth of\nCoastal Shipping\nCoastal Shipping\nCoastal Shipping\nCoastal Shipping\nCoastal Shipping\n\nS.
