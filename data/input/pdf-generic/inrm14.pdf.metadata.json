Fuel con-\nsumption for every ton-kilometer of freight carried is only 15% of that\nby road and 54% of that by rail. The emissions (except SO ) also are\n2\nmuch lower than in rail or road transport. Coastal shipping is also more\nsuited to handling bulky consignments. Coast-to-coast carriage of goods\nby coastal shipping costs 21% that by road and 42% that by rail.1\nIndia has a coastline of around 7500 km and a number of major\nand minor ports. An optimal mix of road, rail, inland water transport,\nand coastal shipping will provide an efficient transport infrastructure\nwith mobility, flexibility, and energy and cost efficiency.\nRoad transport has an edge over rail or water transport because\nmost of the production and consumption centers are landlocked. Also,\nit provides door-to-door movement. Over the years, there has been\nsubstantial investment in its infrastructure. Coastal shipping, on the\nother hand, involves double-handling costs. Lack of policy measures to\npromote coastal shipping is another reason why it accounts for only 7%\n1 TCS (Tata Consultancy Services), Study on Development of Coastal Shipping\nand Minor Ports, prepared for Government of India, Ministry of Shipping, December\n2003.", "of domestic cargo movement.

Government should now move forward on the matter.\nSome possible policy initiatives and fiscal and financial incentives to\nCCCCCaaaaarrrrrgggggooooo     PPPPPooooottttteeeeennnnntttttiiiiiaaaaalllll\nencourage coastal shipping are:\nTCS projections for coastal traffic are for an increase from 54 million\n\u2022 Review cabotage laws\ntons (MT) in 2001-2 to 83.28 MT in 2006-7 and 107.08 MT in\n\u2022 Exempt customs duties on spares and bunker fuel\n2011-12. TCS has further studied the economics of cargo diversion\n\u2022 Extend tonnage tax to coastal shipping\nusing certain criteria of land and sea distances between different O-D\n\u2022 Consider possible reduction in manning norms\nlocations, quantity of goods, and cargo categories. Handling costs, bunker\n\u2022 Review design specifications\ncosts, standing costs, port tariffs, land movement costs, inventory costs,\n\u2022 Ease ship acquisition by making available capital under more\nand external costs have been taken into reckoning. The study indicates\nattractive conditions\n6 Policy Brief No. 14 Bottlenecks in the Growth of Coastal Shipping 7", "\u2022 Enable this sector to offer more attractive employment opportun-\nities to officers and seafarers\n\u2022 Provide earmarked facilities at major ports, develop minor ports\nfor coastal shipping, and reduce port charges for coastal shipping\n\u2022 Provide for connectivity between ports and the road/rail network\n\u2022 Enact legislation to deal with coastal shipping.\nFiscal benefits should be provided to those who move cargo by\ncoastal shipping as is being done in other countries. It is understood\nthat the Netherlands provides a fiscal incentive equivalent to the freight\ncost incurred in coastal transport. Similarly, government should consider\nallowing a credit of say about 150% of actual freight cost in calculating\nthe taxable income of the consignor company on the lines of the tax\nbenefit provided for research and development in the automobile industry\nin the recent budget. The loss of revenue to government would be\nmore than offset by the savings in cost of oil imports and in overall\nexternal costs. There could be misuse of this concession but if it is\nlimited to bulk cargo like coal, fertilizers, iron ore, etc. the beneficiaries\nwould be large corporate entities who are subject to audit.\n8 Policy Brief No. 14", "ADB\nINRM Policy Brief No. 14\nBBBBBooooottttttttttllllleeeeennnnneeeeeccccckkkkksssss     iiiiinnnnn     ttttthhhhheeeee     GGGGGrrrrrooooowwwwwttttthhhhh     ooooofffff\nCCCCCoooooaaaaassssstttttaaaaalllll     SSSSShhhhhiiiiippppppppppiiiiinnnnnggggg\ns SSSSS.....
