INTRODUCTION \n \nMyanmar\u2019s banking system was the envy of Asia before the country nationalized banks in 1963, when it \nhad 10 domestic and 14 foreign banks\u2014the largest concentration of foreign banks in Southeast Asia at \nthat time.1 But until recently, a series of policy shocks had buffeted the finance sector and stunted its \ndevelopment, leaving a legacy of distrust in cash as a unit of value and banks as a secure place to hold \nwealth.  \n \nThis paper presents the Government of Myanmar the broad outlines of a reform strategy to \ndevelop a stable and efficient finance sector that can again support rapid and inclusive growth. The \nfinance sector is the lifeblood of any economy, and its smooth functioning is central to achieving these \ngoals. A well-functioning financial system must intermediate efficiently between savers and borrowers; \nmanage risks prudently; provide a wide variety of financial services to firms, farms, and households; \nmobilize savings effectively; identify and lend for sound investments; remain robust against shocks; and \nensure that access to finance is available to all.  \n \nBanking system structure. Myanmar\u2019s financial system now comprises 4 state banks, 22 \nprivate banks (nine of which are really semigovernment institutions), 42 representative offices of \nforeign  banks  and  foreign  finance  companies,  1  state-owned,  and  12  newly  licensed  insurance \ncompanies, and a nascent capital market. While the  state banks still dominate, private bank assets now \nsignificantly exceed state banks\u2019 after rapid growth in recent years. A new microfinance bank was \nrecently established and authorities are considering license applications for a housing bank and a \nlivestock development bank. Because the country does not yet permit foreign direct investment (FDI) \nin banking, it has representative offices of foreign banks in Yangon, which provide liaison support to \nclients operating in the country. \n \nBanking system challenges. By most measures, Myanmar\u2019s formal financial system is small \ncompared to other countries. Rural areas have limited access to banking services, and bank lending to \nagriculture is largely restricted to the state-owned Myanma Agricultural Development Bank, which \nfaces financial and operational challenges of its own and covers only a small share of the financing \nneeds of farmers.  \n \nThe banking system also faces other challenges. Collateral-based lending inevitably restricts \nlending to land holders, although the government recently expanded collateral options to include key \nagricultural  export  goods.  State-imposed  social  responsibilities  encumber  state  banks,  which \nconsequently have little incentive to manage risk and are in parlous financial condition. Dynamic \nprivate banks, meanwhile, are rapidly losing market share of lending to businesses. Private banks also \nhave  shortcomings.  Closely  integrated  private  commercial  groups  own  most  of  them,  and \nconsequently, their loan portfolios tend to be concentrated within these groups, which can mask \nlarge risks.  \n \nGrowth  of  the  financial  system  in  general  and  the  banking  system  in  particular  is  also \nconstrained by weaknesses in basic institutional systems and infrastructure. The financial system \nespecially needs an automated payments clearance system, a money market system comprising an \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n1   The 10 Burmese banks were Innwa Bank, Export Import Bank, Union Cooperative Bank, Rangoon Bank, Burmese National \nBank, Myanmar Eastern Bank, Burmese Economic Bank, Myanmar Central Commercial Bank, Tavoy Bank, and Upper \nBurma Bank. The 14 foreign banks were India Central Bank, Chartered Bank, Habib Overseas Bank, India Overseas Bank, \nMercantile Bank, United Commercial Bank, Punjab National Bank, India State Bank, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking \nCorporation, National and Grindlays Bank, Communication Bank, China People\u2019s Bank, Netherlands Trading Association \nBank, and the Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation. \n\u00a0", "2   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \ninterbank market, a bond market, a repo market for modern liquidity management, and an electronic \nreal-time  data  system  that  connects  commercial  and  development  banks  with  the  central  bank \n(Nijathaworn et al. 2015). \n \nOngoing banking reforms. The government has made swift progress in reforming the policy \nand institutional environment for the finance sector since the launch of broad economic reforms. Most \nsignificantly,  it  liberalized  the  foreign  exchange  market  and  approved  a  new  FDI  law,  with \naccompanying rules and regulations. The government has also made concerted effort to improve the \ncountry\u2019s  financial  infrastructure  by  enacting  new  laws  to  strengthen  the  financial  system,  most \nnotably the Central Bank Law and the Securities Exchange Law. It has launched programs with the \nsupport of technical assistance from the international community to introduce an interbank clearance \nand settlement system, establish a stock exchange, strengthen bank supervision, develop the foreign \nexchange market, and prepare a finance sector development master plan. \n \nThe need for a finance sector development strategy. The rapid development of the finance \nsector, while ensuring stability, efficiency, and increasing access to financial services, is now the \npriority. To achieve these objectives, the government needs to prepare a finance sector development \nstrategy, using as a starting point the master plan it is preparing with the help of the International \nMonetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. The strategy should focus on three objectives\u2014increasing \nfinance sector efficiency, stability, and inclusion. It could also include the following elements: \n \nKey reform priorities for finance sector development. The highest priority in the financial \nsystem is to build strong institutional foundations for the banking system that will improve the efficiency \nof financial transactions and improve their safety and security. These would include:  \n \ni.  An automated clearance system. The authorities are implementing this with the assistance \nof the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Banks in Myanmar spend a lot of time \nmoving large amounts of cash from bank to bank, branch to branch, and to and from the \ncentral bank, with a lot of time and labor devoted to counting money at each of these points \n(which, despite counting machines, are prone to errors). Introducing a clearance system for \nchecks will significantly improve banking efficiency. \nii.  An automated payments system. The Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM) is introducing this \nwith JICA\u2019s help, in tandem with the clearance system (due to start in 2015). The payments \nsettlement  system  and  the  clearance  system  have  to  be  fully  consistent  to  ensure  that \ntransfers between banks occur immediately after checks clear.  \niii.  A money market system. The next steps for this include the introduction of new short-term \ncentral bank financial instruments and an auction system; an interbank market together with a \nrepo market to ameliorate counterparty risk, CBM liquidity facilities for when the interbank \nmarket  proves  inadequate,  and  application  of  reserve  requirements  and  judicious  use  of \nliquidity ratios. The IMF and the World Bank are providing technical assistance to the CBM in \nall these areas. \niv.  A credit information system. This should have legal protection to encourage its activities, \nintegrity of the database, and that information is used only to advance public policies, privacy, \nand enforcement and supervision. \nv.  Financial  accounting  standards.  All  banks  and  corporates  should  eventually  use  the \nMyanmar Financial Records Standard (MFRS) and make public their audited bank balance \nsheets and income statements. \n \nEnhancing  the  role  of  FDI  in  deliberate  steps. The entry of foreign-owned banks into \nMyanmar\u2019s financial system is desirable because of the potentially beneficial effects for the banking \n\u00a0", "Developing Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   3 \nsystem\u2019s efficiency and modernization. But the authorities need to be careful at this stage of the \ncountry\u2019s financial development that a sudden entry of foreign banks does not exacerbate systemic \nfinance sector risks. Given weak portfolios in many domestic banks and the absence of a strong \nregulatory and institutional framework supportive of stability and risk management in the banking \nsystem, it would be best to phase in the entry of foreign banks. The authorities could begin by \nencouraging  strategic  partnerships  and  joint  ventures,  and  then  proceed  to  minority  foreign \nshareholdings in domestic banks. As conditions permit, licenses could then be issued for majority \nforeign-owned  banks.  This  policy  transition  could  take  many  years,  as  it  will  depend  on  the \ndevelopment of the institutional and regulatory system, and the speed with which domestic banks \nacquire adequate financial and competitive strength. However, if the government allows the full \nforeign ownership of banks immediately, it may need to apply ceilings on the market share that foreign \nbanks can acquire in the initial years to prevent their entry from generating systemic risks in the \ndomestic financial system.  \n \nPhasing in a new interest rate policy. Liberalizing interest rates too early in the absence of a \nstrong financial infrastructure and a supervision and risk management system can lead to risky bank \nbehavior and exacerbate systemic risks. The authorities should carefully consider the sequencing of \nthese actions. First, the CBM should continue to determine the interest rate structure administratively, \nbut take care that banks earn positive real returns on deposits and have an adequate intermediation \nmargin.  Second,  when  the  CBM\u2019s  capabilities  are  well-developed  and  a  suitably  strong  financial \ninfrastructure is in place, the central bank could consider replacing a fixed interest rate structure with a \nfloor for lending rates and a ceiling for interest rates. This will gradually introduce some competition \namong banks on the price of capital (at the margin). Finally, after perhaps a decade or two of strong \nfinance sector development, the government could consider liberalizing lending rates first and then, \nlater, liberalizing deposit rates. This last stage, however, should not be a current concern for policy \nmakers. \n \nConsolidating the number of private banks. Given Myanmar\u2019s stage of development, the \nnumber of commercial banks appears to be more than ample. Allowing more bank entrants at this \nstage would lower franchise values, encourage risky behavior, and increase the probability of bank \nfailures. Instead, the authorities should encourage mergers between banks to reduce their number\u2014\nand start with the state banks. \n \nApplying  regulations  equally  to  state  and  private  banks.  To  encourage  competition \nbetween banks, the CBM and the government should ensure that laws and rules relating to the finance \nsector apply equally to state banks and private banks. Another reform to encourage competition could \nbe to allow banks that bid successfully at foreign exchange auctions to indicate an account of their \nchoice for depositing auction-bought foreign exchange. To find other efficiency enhancing solutions, \nthe CBM should regularly consult with the private banks and with representatives of the public and \nenterprises. \n \nRestructuring state banks and semigovernment financial institutions. In due course, the \ngovernment should return to the CBM and the Ministry of Finance all central banking and treasury \nfunctions performed by state banks, so that state banks can focus on their banking activities. In \naddition, state banks, as well as the nine semigovernment financial institutions, need to undergo \nthorough international-standard financial and performance audits (financed by donor grants). The \naudit results should be the basis for preparing a forward-looking strategy for their restructuring, which \ncould include closure, merger, privatization, or transformation into one, or at most two, well-financed \nand clearly focused development banks (or credit guarantee agencies). \n \n\u00a0", "4   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \nEstablishing state-owned development banks. The government\u2019s decision to establish a \ndevelopment bank will link closely to its restructuring program for state banks. Those that survive \nshould  focus  on  development  banking,  leaving  commercial  banking  to  the  private  sector.  If  the \ngovernment does decide to proceed with a development bank arrangement, such as a credit guarantee \nscheme for lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), it should do so in partnership with \norganizations such as the International Finance Corporation (IFC) or the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). It should also build on the experience of other Asian countries, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, \nand Thailand. \n \nStrengthening the CBM\u2019s supervisory capacity. The CBM, with the support of grant funding \nfrom  the  donor  community,  should  consider  hiring  20  world-class  banking  supervisors  from \nneighboring  Asian  countries  for  about  5  years.  These  supervisors  could  kick-start  the  CBM\u2019s \nsupervision capacity (and the adherence of banks to MFRS), and train CBM supervisors who can then \ntake over all supervision responsibilities within the 5-year period.  \n \nStreamlining regulations. The CBM\u2019s reform of its regulatory framework should focus on \nmoving from direct, ex-ante approvals of transactions to indirect, ex-post supervision to ensure banks \noperate responsibly and within the CBM\u2019s guidelines. In addition, the central bank should conduct an \naudit of all bank regulations and eliminate those serving little purpose. If adopted, this would be an \nongoing  process  and  the  authorities  should  seek  the  support  of  advisors  from  the  international \nfinancial institutions, as well as from neighboring central banks. \n \nDeveloping a risk management framework. The authorities should establish a department \nwithin the CBM that identifies insolvent banks, assists in winding down their operations in an orderly \nfashion, and ensures that depositors (especially small depositors) are protected in the process, and \nthat any risks are not transferred to other banks or financial institutions. In other words, authorities \nshould not wait until insolvent institutions become illiquid and precipitate a systemic banking crisis. \n \nEstablishing a deposit insurance system. Depositors have limited information about the risk \nand value of bank assets, which can lead to bank runs and contagion in times of financial stress. \nDeposit insurance can limit the risk of bank runs by guaranteeing that depositors will receive some, or \nall, of their funds if banks become insolvent or illiquid. Deposit insurance protection can only be \nsuccessful if there is an effective supervisory, regulatory, institutional, and financial framework in place. \nThis will take some time to develop in Myanmar. In the meantime, with the assistance of international \nfinancial institutions, the government should study the feasibility of a deposit insurance scheme and \nthe needed preparatory steps to build a deposit insurance system that borrows from good practice in \ndeveloping economies at a similar stage of financial development. \n \nDeveloping the capital market. This will eventually be composed of the money, government \nbond, corporate bond, and equity markets. However, developing all these will take many years, even \ndecades. The government\u2019s immediate focus should be to develop the money market to help banks \nand other financial institutions manage liquidity, and to provide the foundation for establishing a \ngovernment bond market. It should also begin preparing the legal and institutional infrastructure for \nthe bond market. This will entail establishing a primary dealer system, as well as a safe and secure \nsecondary market system, building a broad investor base, and preparing a steady pipeline of debt \nsecurities based on a credible government debt strategy. Work on developing the corporate bond and \nequity markets should only begin once the money and the government bond markets are fulfilling their \nroles efficiently, which could be several years away. In the meantime, the government should press \nahead with mandating that corporations meet MFRS accounting standards, subject their accounts to \nexternal audit, and make their audited accounts publicly available. \n\u00a0", "Developing Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   5 \n \nEasing restrictions on new bank branches. While the CBM has significantly eased regulatory \nrequirements to open new branches, considerable room remains for reform in this area. For example, \nthere is no need to impose a constant ratio of the capital base to the number of branches, which will \nrequire that banks inject more capital each time they open a branch. Since private banks must \ncompete on service standards, the CBM needs to recognize that these banks have every incentive to \nidentify branches that will improve service standards and ensure prudential safeguards. The CBM \nshould focus on the overall prudential standards for banks and occasionally visit banks to see that their \nsystems meet CBM standards. \n \nReconsidering  the  strategy  for  microfinance.  The  rapid  expansion  of  the  microfinance \nnetwork in Myanmar poses financial risks to the overall financial system. The government should \nimmediately place a temporary moratorium on new licenses for microfinance institutions, and then \ncarefully  review  developments  in  the  microfinance  sector,  as  well  as  the  current  institutional \narrangements for licensing and supervision. Based on these findings, the CBM should recalibrate its \nstrategy for microfinance institutions, as needed, to ensure a sustainable and vibrant microfinance \nsystem. \n \nEncouraging branchless banking. A growing body of analysis points to the many benefits of \nbranchless banking, and many of Myanmar\u2019s private banks are gearing up to introduce it. Expanding \naccess  to  banking  services  through  innovative  approaches  will  help  Myanmar\u2019s  banks  increase \nefficiency and access to finance. This need not result in financial instability if the authorities combine \nappropriate regulatory and supervisory safeguards with market liberalization policies. One particular \nissue, however, needs careful handling\u2014the CBM must continue to emphasize know-your-customer \nrequirements for financial institutions to ensure Myanmar complies with international standards for \nantimoney laundering and combating the financing of terrorism. \n \nSequencing  finance  sector  reforms.  This  paper  also  recommends  sequencing  for  these \nreforms so they address critically binding constraints to finance sector development and ensure reform \ndoes not overburden Myanmar\u2019s scarce administrative and banking skills. Sequencing should initially \nemphasize building the financial infrastructure to underpin the banking system, finalizing the legal \nframework, introducing clearance and settlement systems, strengthening the CBM (especially its \nsupervision capacity), establishing a money market, easing restrictions on new bank branches, and \npreparing the ground for deeper structural changes in the banking system. Authorities should ensure \nthat foreign investment in the banking system occurs slowly and in stages to be consistent with the \nstrength of the regulatory framework and the efficiency and reach of domestic banks. Similarly, interest \nrate reform should proceed in stages; in the early years of the first stage, the interest rate structure \nshould be determined administratively and adjusted periodically to keep interest rates positive in real \nterms as macroeconomic conditions demand. \n \nThe second stage of reforms, over the short- to medium-term, should focus on broader \nstructural  changes  in  the  finance  sector.  These  should  include  restructuring  state  banks  and \nsemigovernment financial institutions\u2014and either closing, merging, or transforming them into one\u2014or \nat most two state-owned development banks\u2014and implementing a revamped microfinance strategy. \nThe second stage should also include developing an operational framework to deal with systemic risks; \nestablishing a government bond market and its prerequisites, which include legal, regulatory, and \ninstitutional infrastructure; preparing the regulatory and legal framework for branchless banking; and \nputting in place a deposit insurance system. \n \n\u00a0", "6   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \nConsistency  with  other  reforms. Myanmar\u2019s finance sector reforms will be taking place \nalongside reforms in other sectors and it is important that all are consistent and coordinated well.2 \nPragmatism demands that the government move ahead with finance sector reforms while reforms in \nthe real sector also get started. But it must ensure that any disruptions in the real sector do not raise \nbanks\u2019 nonperforming loan ratios above prescribed prudential limits. Even more importantly, policies to \nstrengthen Myanmar\u2019s fiscal performance will have major bearing on the outcome of finance sector \nreforms. Strengthening the government\u2019s fiscal position will mean less pressure on the financial system \nto play a quasi-fiscal role. It will also ensure that adequate government resources are available to \nfinance state bank restructuring, establish a development bank, deal with systemic risks in the banking \nsystem, and prevent crowding out of the finance sector. \n \nThe intention of this paper is not to provide a blueprint, but rather to indicate the issues that \nneed addressing and offer ways to address them. The first of its two main sections describes the legacy \nof the past and the current components of the financial system, key features of current finance sector \npolicies, and ongoing reforms. The second sets out the main elements of a finance sector reform \nstrategy, together with how authorities could sequence these reforms and their possible interaction \nwith reforms in other parts of the economy. \n \nFor  clear  direction  and  sequencing  of  reforms,  the  government  needs  a  finance  sector \ndevelopment strategy with the following five important characteristics:  \n \ni.  Base the strategy on a thorough and objective understanding of the financial system as it \nfunctions today.  \nii.  Clearly articulate the objectives of the strategy and ensure they are acceptable to all relevant \nstakeholders.  \niii.  Recognize that not everything can be done at once and so the strategy should adopt a step-by-\nstep approach that ensures binding constraints to finance sector development are addressed \nfirst. The corollary of this will be to accept that while binding constraints are being addressed, \nother less important reforms may need to wait.  \niv.  Evaluate regularly and objectively to inform mid-course corrections in the reform strategy, as \nneeded.  \nv.  Sequence the strategy with reforms in other parts of the economy, notably in exchange rate \nand fiscal policies, and in the real sector. \n \n \nII.  THE LEGACY OF THE PAST \n \nAmong banks operating in Myanmar, before the nationalization of 1963, were such global banking \nmajors of the times as Chartered Bank,3 National Grindlays Bank, and Hong Kong and Shanghai \nBanking Corporation. \n \nA series of policy shocks buffeted the sector thereafter, however, undermining trust in cash as \na unit of value and in the security of banks, as noted in the introduction.

After the military takeover in 1962, the new government on \n26 February 1963 ordered the nationalization of all private banks, eventually incorporating \nthem into four state banks. The nationalization of most large enterprises followed. The number \nof  state  economic  enterprises  grew  rapidly,  as  a  result,  and  by  the  early  1980s,  their \nexpenditures  accounted  for  around  50%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).  Most  state \neconomic enterprises faced \u201csoft budget constraints\u201d in which managers had little incentive to \nmake profits, since the government pressured state banks to extend loans to cover losses. \n \n\uf0b7  Demonetization of 1985\u20131987. In 1985, the Ne Win administration introduced a 75-kyat \nnote  and  15-  and  35-kyat  notes  in  the  following  year.  The  government,  at  the  time, \ndemonetized the 50- and 100-kyat notes in circulation, following a grace period, during which \ncitizens could exchange some of their old notes for new ones. However, in September 1987, \nthe government issued a series of 45- and 90-kyat notes and demonetized the 25-, 35-, and \n75-kyat notes.4 This time, two-thirds of the value of all cash in circulation was effectively \ndeclared illegal with no option to convert existing notes into the new currency. Sporadic \nprotests broke out among students unable to pay their university fees and, by 1988, these had \nbecome widespread, ultimately forcing General Ne Win to step down and triggering a bloody \narmy crackdown on 8 August 1988 (Egreteau 2009). The demonetization instilled widespread \nreluctance to hold currency. Farmers hoarded crops, while others bought what physical assets \nthey could, such as commodities (including gold), land, and even manufactured goods, with \nwhatever domestic currency they possessed. \n \n\uf0b7  Partial liberalization in the 1990s. During the early 1990s, the military leaders who succeeded \nGeneral Ne Win in 1988 introduced a partial liberalization of the domestic economy; as part of \nthat process, private banking was restarted. In 1990, the government promulgated the Central \nBank of Myanmar Law and the Financial Institutions of Myanmar Law, and the first private \nbank (Myanmar Citizens Bank) commenced operations in June 1992. By the end of 1992, four \nprivate banks were in business, and another four in 1993. By the end of 1997, Myanmar had 20 \nprivate banks. \n \n\uf0b7  The  banking  crisis  of  2003. Given the lack of transparency at the time, its origins are \nsomewhat obscure, but it is thought to have started with the collapse of a number of trading \ncompanies that were acting as informal financial institutions. The contagion spread to banks, \nwhich were subsequently instructed to pull back all their loans to increase their own liquidity, \nwhich, in turn, created a real sector depression that further eroded the value of financial assets. \nYoma Bank, the second largest private bank in 2003, could not withstand the abrupt and \nmassive withdrawal of deposits and had to resort to central bank support. Yoma Bank curtailed \noperations, but it was allowed to remain open purely for the transfer of remittances. It took \nMyanmar until 2007 to recover from the banking crisis. \n \nExternal factors exacerbated the domestic causes of the crisis. On 3 November 2003, when \nthe crisis was still ongoing, Financial Action Task Force, an international initiative to prevent \nmoney  laundering  and  counter  the  financing  of  terrorism,  imposed  \u201cadditional \ncountermeasures\u201d on Myanmar because of the country\u2019s continuing failure to address \u201cmajor \ndeficiencies in its antimoney laundering regime\u201d (OECD 2003). A week later, the United \nStates (US) Treasury announced that the Mayflower Bank and the Asia Wealth Bank were of \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n4   The reasons behind the move were many. One was to lower inflation by reducing the stock of money in circulation. \nAnother was to render stockpiles of notes held by insurgent groups worthless. A third was to destroy the black market. \nUnfortunately, demonetization achieved none of these aims, but instead caused widespread distress. \n\u00a0", "8   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \n\u201cprimary money-laundering concern.\u201d It directed US financial institutions to take \u201cspecial \nmeasures\u201d against the two banks, and took special action itself on grounds that the two banks \nwere  facilitating  money-laundering  operations  for  drug  trafficking  organizations  (Federal \nRegister 2003) . \n \n\uf0b7  Closure of Universal Bank in 2005. On 5 August 2005, troops closed and sealed branches of \nthe Myanmar Universal Bank, the chair and managing director were arrested, and Myanma \nEconomic  Bank  eventually  absorbed  the  bank.  It  is  still  not  clear  what  prompted  this \ngovernment action. Some suggest the bank was involved in money laundering, which the \ngovernment wanted to stop; others claim the action was to punish the bank\u2019s owners for being \ntoo closely connected to the previous prime minister, who had just been deposed and arrested \non corruption charges (The Irrawaddy 2005).  \n \n\uf0b7  The minicrisis of 2012. On 5 October 2012, following a rumor spread through social media, \nthere was a run on KBZ Bank, Myanmar\u2019s largest private bank. Prompt action by the CBM, \nwhich included media statements emphasizing the financial soundness of all banks and the \ncentral bank\u2019s willingness to guarantee their finances, helped quell the panic. The episode was \na reminder of the fragility of the banking system, but also highlighted the important role \nappropriate central bank policies can play in ensuring stability. \n \nImplications for the current banking system. The policy and internal shocks that Myanmar\u2019s \nfinance sector suffered left several legacies, the most severe of which is a lack of public trust in the \nbanking system. The shocks left the banking system fragile and vulnerable to small shocks. At the same \ntime, the CBM, which was only recently made an independent institution, remains a product of its past. \nIt has limited capacity and has never had the mandate or the authority to oversee state banks. It is \ninstitutionally suspicious of the private banking system and its motivations, as reflected in many direct \ncentral bank restrictions on private banking activity, including strict limits on acceptable collateral for \nloans, loan maturity, interest rates and fees, branch openings, and daily reporting of financials. The \nemphasis on ex ante controls has meant the CBM has not developed the capacity to implement \nindirect prudential regulations that give banks discretion to intermediate funds within well-defined risk \nparameters and ensure their adherence to these regulations through offsite and onsite supervision \n(Nijathaworn et al. 2015). \n \n \nIII.  THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM \n \nFigure 1 presents the main components of Myanmar\u2019s financial system, which as the introduction \nnotes,  comprises  4  state  banks,  22  private  banks  (nine  of  them  really  just  semigovernment \ninstitutions), 42 representative offices of foreign banks and foreign finance companies, 1 state-owned, \nand 12 newly licensed insurance companies, 4 private leasing companies, and a nascent capital market. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0", "Developing Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   9 \nFigure 1: Financial System Structure \n \nCentral Bank of Myanmar \nRepresentative \nState-owned banks  Joint venture banks  Privately owned banks\noffices  \n1.

In October 2015, nine foreign banks were \nawarded bank licenses to operate in Myanmar. \nSource: Central Bank of Myanmar 2014. \n \n \nThe latest available data (for 2010) show that while the four state banks dominate, private \nassets now significantly exceed those of the state banks (See table below). The following is a brief \noverview of the four state banks: \n \n\uf0b7  Myanmar  Economic  Bank  started  operations  in  1976  under  the  Bank  Law  of  1975.  It \nsubsequently assumed a new legal identity under the Financial Institutions Law of 1990, which \n\u00a0", "10   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \nsuperseded  the  Bank  Law  of  1975.  The  bank  shoulders  several  development  and  social \nfunctions on behalf of the government, and is the principal banking vehicle for lending at \nconcessional interest rates to state enterprises, cooperative enterprises, and other state banks \nand organizations. The latter includes, for example, Myanma Agricultural Development Bank, \nthe Myanmar Small Loans Enterprise, and the Government Employees Bank, which provides \ninterest free housing loans for civil servants. Myanmar Economic Bank has increasingly been \nproviding banking services to the private sector as well as foreign exchange and trade-related \nfinancial  services.  But  close  control  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and conservative  lending \npractices (the loan-deposit ratio is low) has meant high losses. The bank also provides treasury \nfunctions as part of the Ministry of Finance and Revenue, which accounts for Myanmar \nEconomic Bank\u2019s extensive network of 320 branches, the largest in the country.  \n \n\uf0b7  Myanma Foreign Trade Bank was also established by the government under the Financial \nInstitutions Law of 1990. Its mandate is to provide trade finance and foreign exchange related \nbanking to the government, state enterprises, and the international community residing in \nMyanmar. It is also responsible for managing the country\u2019s official foreign currency reserves. \nPrior to the recent economic reforms, Myanma Foreign Trade Bank\u2019s monopoly access to \nforeign exchange and its captive market meant that it did not have to compete for clients. As a \nresult,  service  standards  were  considered  very  weak  (even  in  Myanmar\u2019s  uncompetitive \nbanking sector). The bank is shrinking and losing its relevance, now that the CBM is responsible \nfor managing its own foreign exchange reserves, and that most banks, including private banks, \nhave access to foreign exchange, and some have begun financing foreign exchange related \nactivities. Although Myanma Foreign Trade Bank still has a competitive edge through its 140-\nplus correspondent banking relationships worldwide, its private bank competitors are rapidly \nestablishing and expanding their own overseas networks. It is only a question of time before \neven this element of the bank\u2019s remaining competitive edge evaporates.  \n \n\uf0b7  Myanma Investment and Commercial Bank was a part of Myanmar Economic Bank until \n1990, when it became a separate entity under the Foreign Institutions Law of 1990. With \nbranches mainly in Yangon and Mandalay, its primary focus is business and its mandate to \nprovide domestic currency denominated loans for commercial, investment, and development \nactivities, as well as to act as a banking intermediary for foreign investment activities. \n \n\uf0b7  Myanma  Agricultural  Development  Bank,  run  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  provides \ninstitutional credit to small-scale farmers in its capacity as a government agency. It was created \nunder the Myanma Agricultural and Rural Development Bank Law of 1990 to provide banking \nservices for agriculture and was set the specific task of promoting agricultural, livestock, and \nrural enterprises, including processing and production. Legally, it is not obliged to follow the \nrequirements of the Financial Institutions Law of 1990, but it does so in some key areas, \nincluding the structure of its interest rates. Clients receive 10% interest on their deposits and \nmay borrow four times their savings at 15% interest, provided they use the funds for farm \ndevelopment.  \n \nThe bank has three types of loans: short-term, designed to finance the cultivation of one crop; \nmedium-term, with short maturities of 1 to 4 years; and long-term, with maturities of up to 10 \nyears (though these constitute a negligible share of the overall loan portfolio). It extends most \nshort-term cultivation loans to farmer groups that are jointly liable for repayment; here, peer \npressure replaces collateral to encourage repayment. Term loans, on the other hand, are \nsecured by collateral, which cannot be land (as all land is the property of the state). Loan sizes \nare usually small in relation to farmer needs. This is in part because of the limitations imposed \n\u00a0", "Developing Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   11 \nby  collateral  requirements,  but  also  because  of  the  bank\u2019s  somewhat  parlous  financial \ncondition. Being a part of the Ministry of Agriculture, the bank encourages farmers to use their \nloans to purchase seeds, services, fertilizer, and equipment supplied by the ministry rather than \nprivate  sellers.  Myanma  Agricultural  Development  Bank\u2019s  rural  financing  responsibilities \nrequire it to run 14 regional offices, 164 branches, and 48 agency offices, most of which are co-\nlocated with ministry offices and service centers.  \n \nAssets by Bank Type, 2010\n \nNumber  Assets Assets \nType of Bank  of Banksa  (Kyat billions)  (% of GDP) \nState banks  4  1,037.56  3.07 \nPrivate banks  19  1,891.31  5.06 \nRepresentative \noffices  28  ...  ... \nTotal  51  2,928.87  8.13 \n... = not applicable, GDP = gross domestic product. \na As of end-2013. \nSource: Min 2011. \n \nCapital adequacy requirements for state banks are lower than for private banks, and state \nbanks (unlike private banks) are not subject to onsite supervision, although no exceptions are made in \nregulations or instructions. State banks are not restricted in number of branches, whereas private \nbanks are required to increase their capital each time they open a new branch. Managing directors of \nthree state banks are on the CBM\u2019s board of governors (together with the bank\u2019s governor and one \ndeputy governor). The authority of the managing directors of the three state banks occasionally \nexceeds that of the CBM\u2019s governor, which makes it very difficult for the central bank to properly \nsupervise the state banks.  \n \nThe Financial Institutions Law of 1990 included regulations that permitted the establishment \nand operation of private banks. This was the first of a three-stage reform program initiated in that year \nto liberalize private banking. The next two stages, which have so far not been implemented, involved \npermitting private banks to form joint ventures with foreign banks and allowing foreign banks to \noperate independently. It was not until 1992 before the first private banks became operational.  \n \nNot all private banks are fully private; for example, nine of the Myanmar\u2019s 22 banks are \nsemigovernment institutions. They include the following: \n \n\uf0b7  Myawaddy  Bank  is  a  private  bank,  but  wholly  owned  by  Union  of  Myanmar  Economic \nHoldings, a military-run conglomerate, which in turn is ultimately owned by the Ministry of \nDefence and its retired staff. The Directorate of Procurement of the Ministry of Defense holds \n40% of Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings\u2019 share capital, with serving military personnel, \nvarious armed forces\u2019 cooperatives, regimental associations, and veterans groups holding the \nremainder. The management of Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings comprises senior \nfigures within Myanmar\u2019s armed forces. Myawaddy Bank\u2019s head office in Yangon is located in a \nbuilding that was once the headquarters of CBM, reflecting its close links to the military \ngovernment prior to 2011. The bank does substantial business with local and semigovernment \nbodies,  including  the  Yangon  City  Development  Committee  and  the  Border  Areas \nDevelopment Association. In 2005, Myawaddy Bank\u2019s semi-official status brought it under the \npurview of the United States (US) and European Union\u2019s sanctions against the Myanmar \n\u00a0", "12   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \nstate-owned enterprises. These included travel restrictions by the bank\u2019s senior officials, as \nwell as prohibitions against US and European individuals and entities from investing in the \nbank. \n \n\uf0b7  Small and Medium Industrial Development Bank is a public company, but managed by \ngovernment officials (for example, its chair is always the Minister of Industry), and most \nprocedures are typical of a government organization. Formerly known as Myanmar Industrial \nDevelopment Bank founded by the Myanmar Industrial Development Council, the bank was \nset up in 1995 to promote industrial development zones. As a result, the bank mainly provides \nfinancing assistance for SMEs in industrial zones throughout the country, usually through 3-\nyear loans at an interest rate of 8.5% a year. Collateral requirements are very similar to those in \nprivate commercial banks. The bank receives technical assistance from GIZ, the German \ntechnical  assistance  agency,  and  recently  signed  a  cooperation  memorandum  of \nunderstanding with the Industrial Bank of Korea. \n \n\uf0b7  Myanmar  Citizens  Bank  was  the  first  so-called  private  bank  to  be  established  in  1991 \nfollowing the promulgation of the Financial Institutions Law of 1990. It began operations on 2 \nJune 1992. In reality, the bank is government-owned, with the government\u2019s shareholding \nadministered through the Ministry of Commerce. It is considered a medium-sized bank and is \nlisted on the Myanmar Securities Exchange Center. As of January 2013, it had 255 employees \nand 8 branches. \n \n\uf0b7  Cooperative Bank operates under the Ministry of Cooperatives and result from a merger of \nthree cooperative banks in 2004. The three banks\u2014CB Bank (established in 1992), Co-\noperative  Farmers  Bank  (1996),  and  \u2018Co-operative  Promoters  Bank  (1996)\u2014ceded  to \nCooperative Bank several branches across the country making it one of Myanmar\u2019s largest \nbanks. The merger put Cooperative Bank at the top of a pyramid of thousands of cooperative \nsocieties, most of which have ceased functioning. Cooperative Bank is emerging as a dynamic \nbank, becoming the first to issue a cash card (a prepaid travel card issued in collaboration with \nMasterCard,  intended  for  Myanmar  residents  traveling  abroad).  It  has  the  largest  ATM \nnetwork of all the country\u2019s banks (Mahtani 2013). \n \n\uf0b7  Global Treasure Bank is owned by government-organized livestock and fisheries associations, \nbut its loans cover a wide range of sectors. The bank, which was formerly known as Myanmar \nLivestock and Fisheries Development Bank, has 60 branches nationally and has offered money \nremittances into Myanmar through Western Union since January 2013. \n \n\uf0b7  The other semigovernment banks are mostly city-based banks that partly operate as treasuries \nfor local governments and municipalities. They include Yangon City Bank, backed by the \nYangon City Development Committee of the municipal authorities in Yangon; Innwa Bank, \nowned by the Myanmar Economic Corporation, run and owned by current and former military \nofficers; Yadanabon Bank, with just one branch; and Rural Development Bank (previously \nknown as Sibin Thayer Bank), which mainly operates in border areas and is controlled by the \ncentral government.  \n \nThe 10 remaining private banks are genuine private banks. These are: \n \n\uf0b7  KBZ Bank (KBZ is short for Kanbawza) is the largest private bank with 100 branches (as of \nMarch 2013). It recently opened an insurance company, IKBZ. Started in Shan State in 1994, \n\u00a0", "Developing Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   13 \nKBZ Bank is part of the Myanmar Billion Group, which has holdings in a variety of industries, \nincluding mining, trading, distribution, manufacturing, and, most recently, airlines (after the \nbank bought an 80% holding in Myanmar Airways International in 2010 and launched its own \nairline, Air KBZ, in 2011). KBZ Bank is rapidly modernizing, extending its widespread domestic \nremittance  services  to  overseas  customers,  providing  credit  card  and  ATM  services,  and \nimproving service standards. Although it was the object of a bank-run triggered by social media \nin 2012, it emerged relatively unscathed and observers now consider it among the most \nefficient and rapidly growing banks in Myanmar. \n \n\uf0b7  First Private Bank, set up in 1992, was the first genuinely privately owned bank, and it has \nbecome one of the most profitable and dynamic private banks in the country. \n \n\uf0b7  Yoma Bank was the second largest private bank in 2003, but following the banking crisis of \nthat year, had to resort to emergency financing from the CBM and consequently had its \noperations restricted to remittance transfers only. Officials removed those restrictions in 2012, \nallowing Yoma Bank to resume normal operations. It is now in the process of filling its loan \nbook and should soon be an important competitor in the private banking system. \n \n\uf0b7  Asia Green Development Bank was one of four \u201ccrony banks\u201d hastily given a banking license \njust before the military handed over power to a civilian government in 2010. The other three \nare  Ayeyarwady  Bank,  United  Amara  Bank,  and  Myanmar  Apex  Bank.  Asia  Green \nDevelopment Bank has rapidly grown into one of Myanmar\u2019s most important private banks and \nis part of the Htoo Group, possibly Myanmar\u2019s largest conglomerate, which is owned by Tay Za \n(arguably Myanmar\u2019s richest businessmen and possibly its most politically influential one). The \nUS Treasury had previously sanctioned Tay Za, who it called a \"notorious henchman and arms \ndealer.\" In 2013, however, the US Treasury issued a general license to the bank, one of four \nMyanmar banks allowed to transact business with US companies (the others are Myanmar \nEconomic Bank, Myanma Investment and Commercial Bank, and Ayeyarwady Bank). \n \n\uf0b7  Ayeyarwady Bank is owned by U Zaw Zaw and is part of the Max Myanmar Group. The bank \nwas a target of US sanctions, but since 2013, it has been allowed to transact business with US \ncompanies. It has 48 branches and is growing rapidly. \n \n\uf0b7  United Amara Bank is owned by Nay Aung as part of the IGE (originally International Group \nof Entrepreneurs) conglomerate, which has interests in oil and gas, petrol retailing, banking, \nagriculture, timber, and other sectors. \n \n\uf0b7  Myanmar Apex Bank is owned by Chit Khaing and is part of the Eden Group. The bank has 20 \nbranches and is rapidly modernizing its operations. \n \n\uf0b7  Myanmar Oriental Bank, established in 1993, is owned and operated by and for the Chinese \ncommunity in Myanmar. Although not among the largest private banks, it is one of the most \ntransparent,  regularly  publishing  its  financial  statements,  reflecting  its  professional \nmanagement and its desire to eventually become a joint venture with a foreign bank. \n \n\uf0b7  The Tun Foundation Bank is an unusual financial institution, which devotes its net after-tax \nincome to health and education charities. While not at the forefront of growth and efficiency \namong private banks in Myanmar, it is nevertheless a respected institution that seeks to ensure \nthat its operations are within the letter and the spirit of the law. \n\u00a0", "14   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \n \n\uf0b7  The  Asia  Yangon  Bank is a small bank specializing in wholesale banking, servicing large \ncorporate clients, midsized companies, real estate developers, and investors.  \n \nA large number of licensed, small microfinance institutions serve small borrowers. These are \nnot banks per se, although many have a license to collect deposits (See Section VII.C.3 for a detailed \ndiscussion on microfinance). In the formal sector, Microfinance Bank, established in July 2013, is \ncurrently putting its financing arrangements in place. Supported by the IFC with a $2 million loan, it \nwas set up by Cambodia\u2019s ACLEDA Bank, which has an excellent microfinance track record in that \ncountry.  \n \nTwo  bank  license  applications  are  before  the  CBM  awaiting  approval.  Construction  and \nHousing Development Bank has the support of the Ministry of Construction, but its share capital has \nyet to be funded.

There are currently 28 representative offices of \nforeign banks in Yangon, which provide liaison support to clients operating in the country. Perhaps the \nmost visible is Standard Chartered, which, in an agreement signed between President Thein Sein and \nthe United Kingdom\u2019s minister of trade and investment, will work with the British authorities to \ndevelop  capacity  in  Myanmar\u2019s  finance  sector  through  education,  training,  and  technology \ndevelopment (Thuya 2013).  \n \nThere are very few formal nonbank financial institutions. The Ministry of Finance\u2019s Insurance \nBusiness Supervisory Board regulates the insurance industry, but state-owned Myanma Insurance, \nMyanmar\u2019s  only  formal  insurance  company  until  2013,  performs  the  board\u2019s  work,  including  the \nregulatory oversight of the sector. The board granted domestic operators 12 new licenses in 2013 (to \nprovide a range of services similar to Myanma Insurance). These were Aung Myint Mo Min Insurance, \nAung Thitsar Oo Insurance, Ayeyar Myanmar Insurance, Capital Life Insurance Application, Citizen \nBusiness Insurance Company, Excellent Fortune Insurance Company, First National Insurance, Global \nWorld Insurance, Grand Guardian Insurance, IKBZ Insurance, Pillar of Truth Insurance, and Yang \nInsurance Global. Eleven of them have already started operations. \n \nMyanmar has a nascent capital market. An estimated 60\u201370 private companies that operate in \nthe country have shares issued to the public and permit over-the-counter trading in their shares. \nShareholders can visit a company\u2019s offices to buy or sell shares or receive company performance \nupdates. The law permits only Myanmar citizens to buy or sell shares. None of these companies, \nhowever, use the Myanmar Securities Exchange Center, which was established in 1996 as a joint \nventure between Myanmar Economic Bank and Japan's Daiwa Institute of Research. So far, the \nexchange lists only two companies:  Myanmar Citizen\u2019s Bank and the Forest Products Joint Venture \nCorporation. Both are semigovernment institutions (the latter is the commercial arm of the Ministry of \nEnvironmental Conservation and Forestry), and there is virtually no trading in their shares. In 2012, the \nTokyo Stock Exchange Group and Daiwa Securities Group were chosen to help Myanmar set up a \nstock exchange by 2015. \n \n \nIV.  FINANCIAL SYSTEM PERFORMANCE \n \nEvery indication suggests that Myanmar\u2019s finance sector has been growing rapidly, such as the number \nof branches and ATMs, or the amount of deposits, loans, foreign exchange transactions, fund transfers, \nand remittances. Unfortunately, it is difficult to be precise about the rate of expansion because of the \n\u00a0", "Developing Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   15 \nscarcity of relevant data. Although banks do indeed submit data daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and \nannually to the CBM, this information is not publicly available. Even so, it is clear that the genuinely \nprivate banks are the most dynamic participants in the financial system, with the result that the 22 \nprivate and semigovernment banks together have recently outstripped the four state banks in terms of \ntotal financial assets. \n \nThis rapid growth, however, is from a small base. Myanmar\u2019s formal financial system is small by \nmost international standards, including bank assets as a share of GDP, number of bank branches per \n100,000 people, number of bank loans per 1,000 people (Figures 2 to 4). Decades of state ownership \nand policy shocks imposed on the system have contributed to a lack of confidence in cash as a safe \nasset, and in banks as institutions capable of protecting financial assets. Rural areas have limited access \nto banking services, and bank lending to agriculture is largely restricted to the Myanma Agricultural \nDevelopment Bank, which covers only a small share of the financing needs of farmers (Kloeppinger-\nTodd and Sandar 2013).  \n \nFigure 2: Commercial Bank Branches in Low-Income Countries, 2012 \n(per 100,000 adults) \n \nThe Gambia\nNepal\nBangladesh\nKyrgyz Republic\nRwanda\nTajikistan\nKenya\nCambodia\nMozambique\nLiberia\nMalawi\nSierra Leone\nEthiopia\nHaiti\nUganda\nBurundi\nAfghanistan\nTanzania\nMyanmar\nMadagascar\nCongo, Dem.

Recently, however, the \nauthorities expanded collateral options to include key agricultural export goods. Here, private banks \nmanage risks by adjusting the loan value to the estimated value of the collateral. This ratio can be as \nlow as 30%, although most banks use 50%, and in cases where the borrower is considered particularly \ncreditworthy, the ratio can be higher. In the event of default, banks have successfully taken defaulters \nto court to acquire the collateral, but some banks require a presigned deed of sale of the collateral, \nwhich can then be redeemed in the event of default (although this also requires court approval). \n \nState banks are encumbered by social responsibilities imposed by the state, and dynamic \nprivate banks are rapidly eroding their market share of lending to businesses. Indeed, despite privileged \ntreatment by the authorities\u2014for example, interest income on deposits with state banks is nontaxable \nand state banks are not subject to CBM oversight\u2014state banks are unable to compete with their \nprivate sector competitors. Furthermore, state banks have little incentive to manage risk, in part \nbecause  their  lending  is  largely  at  the  direction  of  government,  but  also  because  government \nguarantees ensure that banks will be recapitalized in the event of insolvency. \n \nPrivate banks also have shortcomings. Closely integrated private commercial groups own most \nand, consequently, their loan portfolios tend to be concentrated within the group, which can mask \nlarge risks. The CBM faces considerable challenges in implementing regulations that restrict related-\nparty lending, which include a 20% single borrower limit and a 20% related-party borrower limit. In \naddition, borrowers who do not belong to bank-owning conglomerates\u2014especially micro-, small-, and \nmedium-sized enterprises\u2014find it difficult to access finance from the formal banking system and must \nresort to borrowing from informal sources, where loans are usually at higher interest rates and shorter \nmaturities.  \n \nGrowth of the financial system, in general, and the banking system in particular, is constrained \nby weaknesses in basic institutional systems and infrastructure. The financial system, especially, needs \nan automated payments clearance system, a money market system for modern liquidity management, \nand an electronic real-time data system connecting banks with the CBM. Payments are predominately \ncash-based and often involve the physical movement of large amounts of cash across the country. \nProgress on an interbank payments system has begun, but check clearing between banks is still manual \nand the system for real time gross settlement is still in its planning stage.  \n \nAn informal and unregulated payments network predates the banking system by some 30 \nyears. Under the so-called Hundi system, dealers facilitate payments through business or family \nnetworks, primarily between Myanmar and the rest of the world (Turnell 2009).  \n \nThere is no credit information system and the CBM is only just developing its offsite and onsite \nsupervision capabilities. The reporting systems of the banks and the CBM use fax, with no online, real-\ntime link. The CBM\u2019s capacity to analyze and digest this data is limited, and none of this information is \nmade public. The absence of well-functioning institutional infrastructure and information systems \nlimits financial development; constrains the CBM\u2019s ability to monitor, analyze, and supervise the \nbanking system; and impedes banks\u2019 liquidity and cash management. The lack of debtor information \nalso  leads  banks  to  base  their  lending  on  collateral  and  guarantees,  and  limits  lending  to  small \nborrowers.  \n \n \n\u00a0", "18   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \nV.  RECENT AND ONGOING REFORMS \n \nThe government has made considerable progress in quite a short period in implementing reforms that \nwill have a significant effect on finance sector development. These include policy changes affecting the \nfinancial system directly, as well as those affecting the system indirectly. The most significant example \nof the latter is the liberalization of the foreign exchange market. A daily foreign exchange auction is \nheld and the official exchange rate has now converged to the \u201ckerb market\u201d rate. The generally free \navailability of foreign exchange has increased business opportunities for banks, as it has for the entire \neconomy. Since October 2011, the CBM has granted licenses to private banks for the operation of \nforeign exchange counters, and since November 2011 for foreign exchange dealer licenses (including \nan interbank foreign exchange market and currency remittance services for Myanmar citizens living \nabroad). A new FDI law was approved in 2012, and accompanying rules and regulations have been \nissued. The law provides a conducive legal framework for all foreign investment in the country, \nincluding in the banking system, for example, by protecting foreign investors from the nationalization \nof their assets during the life of a project, and through any extension period approved by the Myanmar \nInvestment Commission. \n \nIn addition, the government has approved important new laws that will contribute to the \ncountry\u2019s financial infrastructure. In July 2013, Myanmar\u2019s President approved the Central Bank Law, \nwhich repeals the Central Bank of Myanmar Law of 1990. However, the rules, regulations, by-laws, \norders, and directives issued under the repealed law remain in force until a new body of associated \nregulations is issued. The main feature of the new law is that the CBM is an autonomous body \nindependent of the Ministry of Finance. Once the associated regulations are issued, the central bank \nwill have two main objectives. The first is to promote efficient payment mechanisms, and ensure \nliquidity, solvency, and proper functioning of the financial system. The second is to foster monetary, \ncredit, and financial conditions conducive to sustainable economic development.  \n \nIn the furtherance of these objectives, the CBM will be able to independently adjust interest \nrates and conduct currency and exchange operations. It will be responsible for the supervision of banks \nonly\u2014nonbank  financial  institutions  and  microfinance  institutions  remain  under  the  supervisory \nauthority of the Ministry of Finance.  \n \nA nine-member governance board has been established, chaired by a newly appointed central \nbank governor. The President\u2019s office must nominate board members, and parliament approves them. \nThe newly independent central bank also plans to double staff and set up new departments. There will \nbe  committees  in  charge  of  financial  stability,  monetary  policy,  payment  systems,  and  foreign-\nexchange management. \n \nThe Central Bank Law of 2013 and its accompanying regulations will allow the CBM to revise \nits earlier practice of implementing prudential regulations through direct interventions\u2014which often \nrequired ex-ante approvals\u2014and replace them with indirect approaches, such as onsite and offsite \nsupervision, real-time electronic data transfer, and ex-post penalties against violations of central bank \nrequirements. The new central bank regulations will need to end the earlier practice of discriminating \nagainst private banks and providing financial support and regulatory forbearance in favor of state \nbanks. For example, capital-deposit ratios are currently applied only to private banks, not state banks. \nDeposit  interest  income  from  state  banks  is  tax-free,  and  they  are  not  required  to  report  their \nfinancials as often as private banks. Private banks are effectively locked out from lending to agriculture, \nbecause state-owned Myanma Agricultural Development Bank operates as an agency of the Ministry \nof Agriculture and bundles inputs provided by state enterprises (for example, seeds and fertilizer) and \nfinancing, and the ministry buys the final agricultural product.  \n\u00a0", "Developing Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   19 \n \nA  new  Securities  Exchange  Law  enacted  in  July  2013  provides  the  framework  for  the \nestablishment of a stock exchange. The law establishes a securities and exchange commission to \nsupervise  the  securities  market.  It  lists  the  licenses  needed  for  businesses  dealing  in  securities \n(brokerages,  underwriters,  investment  advisors,  and  company  representatives),  allows  the \nestablishment of an over-the-counter market, lists actions in violation of the Securities Exchange Law \n(such as insider trading) and prescribes penalties, and provides for setting up a securities depository \nand clearing agency. A new company law now needs to accompany the Securities Exchange Law, to \nprovide for improved corporate governance and accountancy standards, a robust regulatory and \nreporting framework, and a level of transparency that will give domestic and international investors \nadequate information for investment decisions. \n \nA revised Financial Institutions Law is being drafted with the assistance of the World Bank to \nreplace the current 1990 law. The law is expected to set out the licensing requirements for private \nbanks, corporate governance arrangements, and the conditions for foreign investor participation in \nbanking in Myanmar. \n \nBecause of these and other reform initiatives, an overall policy framework for the banking \nsystem is gradually taking shape and is broadly consistent with international norms and practices. \nIncreasingly, the challenge will not be the regulatory framework itself, but the capacity of government \ninstitutions, especially the central bank, to implement these laws and regulations and ensure that all \nbanks, state and private, follow them in spirit and to the letter. Private banks have already been given \ngreater freedom to set up branches, buy and sell foreign exchange, hold foreign exchange assets on \ntheir balance sheets, and, in some cases, even lend indirectly to the agriculture sector. These freedoms \nappear to be piecemeal and not only need to be enshrined in new regulations, but applied to all banks \nequally. \n \nOther central bank policies and regulations governing bank operations may change from time \nto time depending on circumstances and requirements, and include the following: \n \ni.  A  10%  risk-weighted  capital-adequacy  ratio,  which  is  reasonably  cautious,  although  the \ndefinitions of bank capital, risk weightings, and nonperforming loans are not yet based on \ninternational standards. \nii.  A maximum loan-to-deposit ratio of 80%, applicable only to private sector banks, had been in \neffect, but was recently abolished. \niii.  A cap on deposits equivalent to 10 times paid-up capital; this was initially set at seven times \nfollowing the 2003 crisis and relaxed to 10 times in 2006. \niv.  A single-borrower limit and a single related-party lending limit set at 20% of a bank\u2019s capital \nbase. \nv.  A reserve-requirement ratio equivalent to 10% of total deposits. \nvi.  A minimum liquidity ratio equivalent to 20% of deposits (in addition to the 10% required \nreserve requirement with the CBM). \nvii. Maintenance of a general reserve account equal to paid-up capital, to be funded by 25% \nretention of net profits (until the requirement is met). \nviii. General provisioning of 2% of total loans and loan-loss provisioning equal to 50% and 100% of \ndoubtful and bad loans, respectively. \nix.  Loan maturities of more than 1 year are not permitted, but borrowers may roll loans over for a \nfurther 2 years.  \nx.  Collateral is required for all lending; this can be property (land and building), gold, and, recently \nadded, key agricultural export commodities.  \n\u00a0", "20   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \nxi.  The CBM regulates interest rates for deposits and lending. Current lending, deposit, and \ncentral bank rates are set at 13%, 8%, and 10%, respectively. CBM regulations actually permit \nbanks to set deposit rates within a range around prescribed levels, but complaints by smaller \nprivate banks unable to compete against larger, more modern ones led to \u201cinformal\u201d CBM \ninstructions that any variation around the central rates would not be countenanced. \n \nMyanmar  is  making  concerted  efforts  to  improve  its  financial  infrastructure.  The  IMF \ncontinues to provide technical assistance for strengthening the CBM\u2019s capacity (two resident advisors \nwith the CBM will assist foreign exchange market development and bank supervision). It will also help \nin reorganizing the Ministry of Finance now that it has the task of reabsorbing all treasury functions the \nbanking system is currently conducting (IMF 2013a). The World Bank and IMF are helping prepare a \nfinance sector development master plan that includes a finance sector development strategy. JICA is \nhelping develop a CBM electronic network and a clearance and payments settlement system, and the \nTokyo Stock Exchange and Daiwa Institute of Research have been tasked with the development of the \nstock  exchange.  Myanmar  is  also  receiving  technical  assistance  support  from  the  Japan-ASEAN \nTechnical Assistance Fund to enhance the development of a bond market.  \n \nA Myanmar Payment Union has been established with 16 of the 22 private banks as members, \nwith a small number of retailers also in the system. The payment union is already offering a network of \nATMs that permit the withdrawal of cash for customers of participating banks. The plan is for it to link \nwith international card networks, such as VISA, MasterCard, the Japan Credit Bureau, and China \nUnion Pay, all of which have signed agreements with local banks. The CBM, for the first time, has \napproved the issuance of a prepaid, internationally accepted debit card by a semi-official private bank, \nCooperative  Bank,  which  is  collaborating  with  MasterCard.  Other  banks  have  also  applied  for \nintroducing similar prepaid debit card services.  \n \nThe newly established Myanmar Microfinance Supervisory Enterprise is authorized to issue \nlicenses to new microfinance companies\u2014domestic or foreign. It has so far issued 166 licenses, of \nwhich 50 are licensed to issue credit as well as accept deposits from the public (effectively making \nthem banks). According to the IFC, Myanmar has about 2.8 million microfinance clients, with total \nloans outstanding of about $242 million. The Myanma Agricultural Development Bank has the largest \ndomestic microfinance loan portfolio ($86 million). The United Nations Development Program\u2019s \nmicrofinance  arm,  PACT,  is  the  largest  nongovernment  organization  in  the  microfinance  sector \n($29.5 million). Only three foreign microfinance companies have been given a license to operate in \nMyanmar, including Acleda Bank of Cambodia, which started operations in partnership with the IFC. A \nnumber  of  nongovernment  organizations  operate  microfinance  projects;  one  of  them,  Proximity \nDesigns, has received a $2 million grant from the Government of Norway to expand operations. Some \ninternational  nongovernment  organizations  operating  microfinance  projects,  among  them  World \nVision, are considering applying for a commercial license so they can receive equity investments from \ndomestic and international partners to expand their loan portfolios. \n \n \nVI.  NEED FOR A FINANCE SECTOR STRATEGY \n \nMyanmar\u2019s finance sector has made big strides in the past 2 years and many reform initiatives are \nunder  way.  It  is  important  to  maintain  the  momentum.  The  focus  will  need  to  be  the  rapid \ndevelopment  of  the  sector  while  ensuring  stability,  efficiency,  and  increasing  access  to  financial \nservices. \n \n\u00a0", "Developing Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   21 \nTo achieve this objective, the government will need to prepare a finance sector development \nstrategy, using as a starting point the master plan being prepared with the help of the IMF and the \nWorld  Bank.  Stakeholders,  the  finance  sector,  and  the  public  should  thoroughly  discuss  and \nunderstand the strategy. It will eventually need to have the full support of the government and the \ncountry\u2019s highest leadership, and should receive broad-based, nonpartisan support from parliament \nand other stakeholders.  \n \nThe finance sector development strategy should begin with a feasible and ambitious vision of \nthe finance sector by, say, 2030. This should be the reference point for all government policies and \nprograms aimed at the development of the sector. It should also be consistent with and support the \ncountry\u2019s broader development goals. \n \nBy 2030, Myanmar should have a stable, strong, competitive, and inclusive financial system \nthat provides access to financial services to the entire population (compared to 10% today), and \ncontributes to growth by channeling domestic and foreign savings effectively and efficiently toward \nproductive  investments  throughout  the  economy.  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  and  Thailand  offer  good \nexamples of the way forward.  \n \nAt the core of the financial system should be a few large and strong domestic private banks \nthat employ economies of scale and scope to maintain low intermediation margins, provide a range of \nfinancial services efficiently and effectively, extend loans of different maturities, and, having built their \ncapital base, can compete successfully against foreign-owned banks in the domestic market.  \n \nFinancial services will be available to all through a healthy set of microfinance institutions and \none or two large, independent, well-financed, and professionally managed development banks (or \ncredit guarantee agencies). The domestic credit-to-GDP ratio should have reached around 50% \n(around India\u2019s current level and higher than Indonesia\u2019s 35%). The CBM should focus on growth and \nprice stability as twin objectives, ensure systemic stability and smooth functioning of a competitive \nbanking system, and employ market-friendly instruments to conduct monetary policy. The nonbank \nfinance sector should be managed by specialized regulatory institutions, and include domestic private \ncompanies (most domestic and a few foreign) in diverse areas such as insurance, hire-purchase, \npension fund management, and microfinance. The capital market should be a growing source of risk \nequity and bond finance, and the stock market should aim for a capitalization-to-GDP ratio of around \n50% (lower than India\u2019s but higher than Indonesia\u2019s ratio today) although it would still be small in \nrelation to the banking system. \n \nAchieving this vision will first require a finance sector strategy to chart out the needed steps to \nthe desired goals in 2030. Properly sequencing reforms will be critical to avoid crises or missteps. The \nstrategy should also minimize the burden on Myanmar\u2019s limited administrative capabilities and focus \non overcoming constraints that \u201cbind\u201d the sector\u2019s development.  \n \nAlleviating capacity constraints in the finance sector\u2014whether in the central bank or in the \nprivate sector\u2014will be one of the government\u2019s highest priorities when implementing the strategy. \nTraining  will  be  important,  but  not  enough;  policy  makers  must  also  consider  other  innovative \napproaches  to  overcome  capacity  bottlenecks,  including  technology  and  skills  from  abroad  to \ncomplement the domestic contingent. Of equal importance, implementing a financial strategy requires \ncoordinating the many different parts of government and needs guiding by policy makers at the highest \nlevel of government. Periodic evaluation of the progress of implementation and needed adjustments \nare also important.  \n \n\u00a0", "22   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \nThe central bank governor will need to lead implementation of most banking system reforms, \nwhich is why central bank independence and proper implementation of the new Central Bank Law are \nso  important.  The  CBM  also  needs  sufficient  skilled  staff  and  strong  leadership  to  provide  an \ninstitution with a solid knowledge base and experience in banking, finance, central bank operations, \nand macroeconomic policy that has the confidence of the president, as well as the ministers of finance, \nand of planning and economic development.  \n \nEqually  important,  the  government  will  need  to  introduce  a  financial-sector-reform \ncoordination committee at the highest level, led by the central bank governor and the Ministry of \nFinance, to monitor reform strategy progress and to make necessary adjustments. The committee \nshould also be responsible for coordinating donors providing support to the finance sector and make \nsure the donor community supports Myanmar\u2019s priorities and avoid diverting attention to low-priority \nactivities. \n \n \nVII.  KEY COMPONENTS OF A FORWARD-LOOKING FINANCE SECTOR  \nREFORM STRATEGY \n \nThe following section identifies these key components, building on all initiatives under way. It focuses \non three objectives that must underpin the finance sector development strategy: increasing finance \nsector efficiency, stability, and inclusion. \n \nA.  Policies and Measures to Increase Banking System Efficiency \n \nA financial system\u2019s highest priority is to build the strong institutional foundations for the banking \nsystem to improve the efficiency, safety, and security of financial transactions. This requires patience, \nconsistent effort, and, perhaps most important, a change in attitude in the government, the central \nbank, and private commercial banks. Given the scale of the challenge, Myanmar\u2019s authorities should \ntap the international community to help build domestic capacity, with a clear understanding on both \nsides that, except in very few situations, international expertise should not substitute for the domestic. \nInstead, it should transfer skills and systems that build domestic capabilities. The priorities in increasing \nfinance sector efficiency include the following:  \n  \n1.  Automate the Clearance System \n \nThe government has tasked JICA to implement the automation of the CBM clearance and payments \nsettlement system. If approved, JICA will be issuing a request for proposal soon, and the system is \nexpected to be operational by 2015. Clearance for now is manual and, as a result, most transactions are \ndone in cash. As noted, banks spend a lot of time moving large amounts of cash from bank to bank, \nbranch to branch, or to and from the central bank\u2014and considerable time and manpower counting \nmoney at each point (which, despite counting machines, is prone to errors). Introducing a clearance \nsystem for checks and/or electronic transfers will significantly improve banking efficiency. \n \n2.  Automate the Payments System \n \nThis is also being implemented with the help of JICA, in tandem with the clearance system, and is due \nto be operational by 2015. The payments settlement system and the clearance system have to be fully \nconsistent to ensure that banks make transfers immediately after checks and/or transfers are cleared.  \n \n   \n\u00a0", "Developing Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   23 \n3.  Money Market System \n \nThe challenge in the money market system5 is the excess deposits in the banking system (Figure 5). Yet \nthe deposit and credit auction system is not working because the budget for it is not adequate. The \nCBM allows banks to deposit excess liquidity for 14 days at an interest rate capped at 4%, because of \nbudget limitations. This low interest rate gives banks little incentive to use the CBM\u2019s deposit facility, \nespecially because they have other ways to use their excess liquidity, including purchasing treasury \nbonds  from  the  central  bank.  Next  steps  include  the  introduction  of  market-based  monetary \ninstruments (such as central bank bills issued through auctions) that help banks (and eventually \nnonbank financial institutions) manage their liquidity based on price incentives. The CBM\u2019s primary \nobjective should be to encourage banks to trade money and other liquid financial instruments among \nthemselves; only when these prove inadequate should CBM provide funds through its own liquidity \nfacilities. In this regard, repurchase agreements (repos) will be a key instrument and an important \nmethod for the central bank to exert indirect monetary control and influence liquidity in the financial \nsystem.6 Repos become particularly important when counterparty credit risks are high (as they are in \nMyanmar), in that they are a form of collateralized lending. The repo market, however, requires an \nunderlying legal structure. Participants should meet key prudential financial criteria\u2014such as minimum \ncapital requirements and the ability to meet mandated liquidity ratios\u2014and should be subject to \ncentral bank oversight. The CBM should also apply reserve requirements as an initial means to control \nliquidity, and design a framework by which banks can access the central bank\u2019s standing liquidity \nfacilities if their efforts in the interbank market are not successful. The money market will develop as \nthe CBM buys and sells these short-term instruments, adjusts the appropriate level of required \nreserves in line with macroeconomic needs, and alleviates systemic liquidity shortages when they arise. \nThe IMF and the World Bank are providing technical assistance on all these initiatives. \n \nFigure 5: Commercial Banks\u2019 Outstanding Deposits and Loans \n \n14\n12\n10\nn\no 8\nmilli\nt \na 6\ny\nK\n4\n2\n0\n2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013\nOutstanding deposits Outstanding loans\n \nSource: IMF 2013b. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n5   For a more detailed discussion, see Nijathaworn et al.

Credit Information System \n \nAsymmetric information between lenders and borrowers is one of the most important market failures \nin financial markets. One way to partially correct this is with a credit information system in which all \nbanks have secure access to a smoothly functioning interbank information system that shares accurate \nand up-to-date data on the outstanding stock of debt of individual debtors, terms of loans, collateral \npledged, and repayment records. Myanmar has no such system and has not begun work on one. A \nmodern, credit-based economy requires access to complete, accurate, and reliable information on \nborrowers\u2019 payment histories. Key features of a credit information system include the following:  \n \ni.  A legal framework. Credit information systems should have legal protection sufficient to \nencourage their activities without eliminating incentives to maintain high levels of accuracy. \nii.  Operations. Measures should be employed to safeguard information contained in the credit \ninformation system and incentives should exist to maintain the integrity of the database. \niii.  Public policy. The information collected and distributed by credit information systems can be \nused to advance public policies. \niv.  Privacy. Subjects of information in credit information systems should have access to their \ninformation and be able to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information, and mechanisms \nshould exist to have such disputes investigated and have errors corrected. \nv.  Enforcement/supervision. A credit information system could permit regulators to assess an \ninstitution\u2019s risk exposure, and sanctions for violations of laws regulating credit information \nsystems should be sufficiently stringent to encourage compliance. \n \n5.  Financial Accounting Standards \n \nThe  Myanmar  Financial  Records  Standards  (MFRS)  have  already  been  issued,  but  they  are  not \nenforced, and without this, the CBM\u2019s supervision of banks becomes very difficult. It is crucial that all \nbanks and firms use accounting systems that meet the MFRS so that balance sheet, profit-and-loss, \nand income and expenditure data\u2014as well as all typical financial ratios\u2014are based on the same \ndefinitions. Although CBM supervisors analyze the daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly financials to \nmake sure banks are abiding by the central bank\u2019s prudential regulations, the absence of standards \nmakes it difficult to know that the numbers truly reflect the actual condition of the banks. In addition \nto ensuring that all banks use the MFRS, it is important that the CBM require all banks to publish their \naudited balance sheets and income statements, post them on bank websites, and issue them in printed \nform for the public, stakeholders, and relevant parties. The 1990 Financial Institutions Law does not \nrequire this, an oversight the new Financial Institutions Bill needs to correct. With real-time, electronic \naccess to commercial banks accounts (which should be part of the JICA-supported clearance and \npayments settlement system), CBM supervisors can better analyze the actual submitted data for a \nbetter understanding of banks\u2019 financial positions, the riskiness of their portfolios, and their solvency \nand liquidity. Introducing MFRS in corporate accounts would also significantly improve the ability of \ncommercial banks to assess their credit risks. \n \n6.  Enhance the Role of Foreign Direct Investment in Deliberate Steps  \n \nForeign banks can now only run representative offices, while the financial institutions law forbids \nforeign investment in domestic banks. Virtually all foreign investors and traders use foreign banks \nbased abroad to finance their operations in Myanmar. While this could continue, it obviously limits and \nimpedes  foreign  investments  in  Myanmar  and  prevents  state-of-the-art  financial  services  from \nentering the financial system and benefiting households and firms. Debate is ongoing whether and how \nforeign  banks  can  gradually  enter  the  banking  system.  The  authorities  are  considering  various \n\u00a0", "Developing Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   25 \npossibilities, including strategic partnerships, joint ventures, and, finally, full ownership. Many private \nbanks are keen to enter into partnerships or joint ventures with foreign banks to get access to new \ntechnology, training, finance, external retail branching networks, and better management. \n \nAuthorities should base their decisions on the role of FDI in the banking system and a clear \nunderstanding of its advantages for the finance sector and the systemic finance sector risks that the \nimmediate entry of foreign banks could induce. International evidence shows that FDI in the banking \nsector can offer important benefits, but that it can indeed introduce risks (Claessens, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, \nand Huizinga 2001). Foreign banks can help build a more robust and efficient banking system by \nintroducing international practices and standards; by enhancing the quality, efficiency and breadth of \nfinancial services; and by accessing more stable sources of funds. These benefits could be substantial, \nprovided the regulatory and institutional framework for the financial system is strong. But if it is weak, \nthe benefits and costs of FDI depend on how it is phased in and what other reforms, particularly in the \nregulatory and institutional framework, accompany it. Countries with successful experiences opened \nup to foreign banking only after they already had well-developed institutional capacity and they were \nalready engaging in rapid domestic deregulation. Successful examples are mainly of middle-income \nand advanced economies such as Argentina, Spain, Ireland, and Portugal. There are no examples, \nhowever,  of  low-income  countries  that  opened  the  banking  sector  successfully  to  FDI  without \nnumerous restrictions and limits. \n \nIt follows that the Myanmar authorities for the time being may wish to err on the side of \ncaution when considering the entry of foreign banks. The institutional infrastructure and regulatory \nframework for banking remain weak and will take years to strengthen. The premature entry of foreign \nbanks could lead to a rapid shift in the depositor base from domestic banks to the new foreign bank \nentrants, placing domestic banks at risk of financial distress and possibly placing the solvency of the \nentire domestic financial system at risk as well.  \n \nThat does not mean, however, that FDI in banking should not be encouraged at all. On the \ncontrary, the authorities should encourage domestic banks to pursue strategic partnerships and joint \nventures with foreign banks. Some of these cases may involve accepting foreign share capital in an \nexisting domestic bank. In others cases, a joint-venture bank could be established anew (although the \ngovernment would need to take care that the number of new banks be kept in check (See Consolidate \nthe Number of Commercial Banks on page 27).  \n \nIt is possible that in the first few years no foreign banks will be eager to assume the role of \nminority shareholder in a Myanmar bank. This should not discourage the government. With further \nstabilization and reform of the banking system along the lines suggested in this paper, foreign interest \nin joint ventures will pick up.  \n \nIn the meantime, the government, with support of bilateral donors, as well as the World Bank \nand ADB, should contract foreign banks to provide technical assistance and training to Myanmar bank \npersonnel  and  management.  In  subsequent  years,  when  the  authorities  are  convinced  that  the \nregulatory and institutional framework is in place and domestic banks are financially sound, they may \nconsider licensing majority foreign-owned bank operations in Myanmar. If, on the other hand (and \nagainst the recommendations contained in this paper), the authorities allow full foreign ownership \nimmediately, then they would be prudent to impose a ceiling on the market share that foreign banks \ncan acquire to prevent the emergence of systemic risks in domestic banks.  \n \n   \n\u00a0", "26   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \n7.  Interest Rate Policy \n \nCurrently, interest rates are fixed (Figure 6)\u201410% is the central bank reference rate at which banks can \nborrow from the central bank. Deposit rates are set 2 percentage points below (8%) and lending rates 3% \nabove (13%). Treasury bond rates are also linked to the reference rate\u20148.5% for 2 years, 9.0% for 3 years, \nand 9.5% for 5 years. While CBM regulations allow banks to compete within a narrow band around these \ninterest rates, in reality the CBM requires strict adherence to the actual rates (banks are expected to \ncompete on service standards, not interest rates). The fixed interest rate structure has meant that real \ninterest rates have been very volatile, given the variance in inflation rates (Figure 7). The fixed interest \nrate structure also permits banks to use their excess liquidity to purchase treasury bonds, but liquidity \nshortages are somewhat more difficult to manage in the absence of a secondary market. \n \nIn finance sector reform priorities, it is best that the CBM does not initially change its approach to \na fixed interest rate structure (it should adjust this structure from time to time to reflect macroeconomic \nconditions  and  monetary  policy  objectives),  but  focus  instead  on  building  the  financial  system\u2019s \ninfrastructure, including its own supervision system. Liberalizing interest rates too early in the absence of \na strong financial infrastructure and supervision and risk management system can lead to risky bank \nbehavior and exacerbate systemic risks. The appropriate sequence should be the following:  \n \ni.  First, stick to the CBM establishing the interest rate structure as it is doing now, but ensure that \ndepositors earn positive real returns on deposits and banks have an adequate intermediation margin.  \nii.  Second, after some years and the development of CBM capacity and suitably strong financial \ninfrastructure, the central bank could consider replacing the fixed interest rate structure with a \nfloor for lending rates and a ceiling for interest rates. As noted in the introduction, this will \ngradually introduce some competition among banks on the price of capital (at the margin).  \niii.  Finally, after what could be more than a decade or two of strong finance sector development, \nthe government could consider liberalizing lending rates first, and later liberalizing deposit \nrates. This last stage is not something that should concern policy makers now. \n \nFigure 6: Lending and Deposit Interest Rates, 1976\u20132012 \n18\n16\n14\n12\n10\n%\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n6 8 0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6 8 0 2\n197 197 198 198 198 198 198 199 199 199 199 199 200 200 200 200 200 201 201\nLending interest rate Deposit interest rate\n \nSource: World Bank.

World Development Indicators. http://data.worldbank.org (accessed June 2014). \n \n8.  Consolidate the Number of Commercial Banks \n \nMyanmar\u2019s commercial banking system has 24 banks, including the Microfinance Bank established \nrecently, and could add a Construction and Housing Development Bank and a Livestock Development \nBank. Are more banks better than fewer? Research in many countries suggests that authorities need to \nbalance the increased competition that comes from having more banks in a financial system with the \neconomies of scale that come with larger banks and the franchise value of banks that can affect their \napproach to risk taking. If franchise values decline too much, banks can become risk prone just to \nsurvive in a highly competitive environment, generating systemic risks (Caprio 2010).7 In this sense, the \nfinance  sector  is  very  different  from  other  services  and  goods  sectors.  So,  for  now,  Myanmar\u2019s \ncommercial bank contingent appears more than ample. Not only would it make little sense to allow \nmore bank entrants at this stage, it would be appropriate for the authorities to encourage mergers \nbetween banks to reduce the number, starting with the state banks (See Restructure State Banks on \npage 28). \n \n9.  Apply Regulations Equally to State and Private Banks  \n \nAs noted earlier, with weak central bank oversight and supervision, it would be inappropriate to allow \nbanks to compete for deposits and borrowers on interest rates. Not allowing them will avoid excessive \nrisk-taking and lower the probability of bank failures. At the same time, however, banks must be \nallowed to compete based on service standards and fees. An important component of bank income \naccrues from fees for remittances, whether domestically or internationally. The CBM has fixed the \nremittance fee at 0.125% of the transfer amount\u2014but such fees could be subject to competition \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n7   Also, see Agoraki, Delis, and Pasiouras 2009.  \n\u00a0", "28   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \nbetween banks. Similarly, to encourage bank competition, the CBM and the government should ensure \nthat rules under the Financial Institutions Law are applied equally to state banks and private banks. \nThere is no reason to treat the Myanma Economic Bank, Myanma Foreign Trade Bank, and Myanma \nInvestment and Commercial Bank (MICB) differently when it comes to prudential risk ratios or the tax \ntreatment of income from deposits.  \n \nThe CBM could also help reduce costs and encourage competition by allowing banks that bid \nsuccessfully at the foreign exchange auction to indicate an account of their choice to deposit this \nforeign exchange. At present, the foreign exchange is deposited at the head office account of the \nprivate banks\u2014when the money is needed outside the country to pay for import purchases of bank \nclients. Other similar, low-cost solutions would significantly increase banking system efficiency; the \ncentral bank should regularly consult private banks and public representatives (and enterprises) to find \nthem. \n \n10.  Restructure State Banks \n \nPolicy makers need to consider the role of the four state banks in the future banking system carefully. \nAuthorities should return the central banking and treasury functions of these banks to the central bank \nand the Ministry of Finance in due course, so that the state banks can focus on their banking activities. \n \nIn addition, the government could consider two alternative approaches to separating the \nAgricultural Development Bank from the Ministry of Agriculture. The first would make it a separate \nand restructured state development bank that would need to be adequately capitalized and focused \nsolely  on  supporting  small-scale  agricultural  borrowers.  Alternatively,  it  could  transfer  the \nresponsibilities of the Agricultural Development Bank to the microfinance banking system as well as \nthe remaining private and state banks.  \n \nSimilarly, the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank (which would need to return the external reserve \nmanagement functions to the CBM) could transfer its international fund transfer responsibilities to the \nMICB and allow the MICB to compete with private banks. Now that they have their foreign exchange \nlicenses and are developing their correspondent banking networks abroad, private banks are operating \nin the same space. \n \nFinally, the Myanma Economic Bank and the MICB should undergo thorough international-\nstandard financial audits (again, financed by donor grants). This would thoroughly assess their current \nfinancial condition. Based on the results, the authorities should fully capitalize these two banks in \naccordance with CBM requirements (which should be the same for all banks). They should also \nchange their mandate from commercial banking (which private commercial banks should provide) to \ndevelopment banking. Finally, the CBM should subject them to the same prudential standards and \nsupervision oversight as required for private banks. Good examples of other countries adopting similar \nreforms are Viet Nam, when it applied ADB resources to audit two state banks before restructuring \nthem, and Indonesia, which used donor resources to finance audits of state and private banks prior to \nclosing or restructuring them. \n \nB.  Policies to Promote Financial System Stability \n \n1.  Strengthening Central Bank of Myanmar Supervision Capacity \n \nThe CBM\u2019s bank supervision department has fewer than 20 bank supervisors (split equally between \nonsite and offsite supervision duties). The CBM needs more supervisors and to train all its supervisors \n\u00a0", "Developing Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   29 \nin the latest techniques. This will take time, but the demand for high-quality supervision capacity is \nurgent. The CBM, with the support of grant funding from the donor community, should therefore \nseriously consider hiring 20 world-class supervisors from neighboring Asian countries, and therefore \nare familiar with Asian conditions. These supervisors could be contracted for a period of about 5 years \nto kick-start the CBM\u2019s supervision capacity (and the adherence of banks to MFRS), and to train CBM \nsupervisors who can then take over all supervision responsibilities within the 5 years.  \n \n2.  Streamlining Regulations \n \nThe thrust of the CBM\u2019s reform of its banking regulatory framework will need to be from direct and ex \nante oversight and approvals of transactions to indirect and ex post supervision to ensure banks are \noperating responsibly and within central bank guidelines. More regulations do not necessarily translate \nto more stability, and could instead smother banking development. Smarter regulation is needed. One \napproach to achieve this would be to conduct an audit of all banking regulations and eliminate those \nthat serve little purpose\u2014for example, eliminate all restrictions that impede private banks from lending \nto agriculture, eliminate restrictions to opening new branches (including incremental capital and \nstaffing requirements), and so on. This will be ongoing and could be supported by advisors from \ninternational financial institutions and other central banks. \n \n3.  Developing a Risk Management Framework, Including a Resolution Framework \nand Process for Insolvent Banks \n \nA key part of ensuring financial system stability is to allow the orderly exit of financial institutions that \nbecome  insolvent  and  have  little  chance  of  regaining  solvency.  Authorities  should  not  wait  for \ninsolvent institutions to become illiquid and precipitate a systemic crisis, nor should they try to prop up \ninstitutions with open-ended financial support (whether from the budget or from the CBM\u2019s liquidity \nfacilities), or to curtail competition to protect the viability of certain banks. Instead, the CBM or the \nMinistry of Finance should consider establishing a department that can assist in the orderly winding \ndown of unviable banks, ensuring that depositors, especially small ones, are protected, and that risks \nare  not  transferred  to  other  banks  or  financial  institutions.  Such  a  department  could  also  be \nresponsible for restructuring state banks to make them viable.  \n \n4.  Establishing a Deposit Insurance System \n \nDepositors have limited information about the risk and value of bank assets, which during crisis can \nlead to bank runs and contagion. Deposit insurance can limit these risks by guaranteeing depositors \nthat they will receive some, or all, of their deposited funds if their banks become insolvent or illiquid \n(Angkinand and Wihlborg 2008).  \n \nMyanmar\u2019s  deposit  insurance  system  is  currently  the  responsibility  of  the  state-owned \nMyanma Insurance Agency, which is also responsible for licensing other insurance agencies and \nsupervising their activities. While it may have experience in standard insurance activities, such as life \nand health insurance, it has limited experience with deposit insurance, in which typical actuarial tables \ncannot calculate the risks, but a deep understanding of bank function, and where risks are likely, can. \nFor this reason, deposit insurance agencies, typically, are separately funded agencies that work closely \nwith the central bank. \n \nClearly, deposit insurance alone cannot be a panacea for addressing financial instability in \nbanks. On the contrary, deposit insurance will be unsuccessful without effective bank supervision, \nemergency liquidity lines, and strong prudential standards implemented by the CBM.  \n\u00a0", "30   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \n \nAt the same time, if the CBM were to provide deposit insurance protection, it would design it \nto encourage prudential standards and discourage risky behavior (moral hazard). The central bank can \nachieve this by introducing penalties for risky behavior by bank owners and management. Deposit \ninsurance protection, if available, should only cover small savers, placing shareholder equity at stake in \nthe event of bank insolvency. To further avoid moral hazard, not only should the government refrain \nfrom issuing guarantees on an ad hoc basis for favored private or public projects, it should also insist \nthat adequate risk-based premiums are collected to finance any provision of a deposit protection \nservice. In Myanmar, where bank supervision and other prudential mechanisms are weak or largely \nabsent,  deposit  insurance\u2014albeit  limited  in  what  it  can  do\u2014can  still  contribute  toward  the \nstabilization of the banking system. At the same time, it is important to remember that deposit \ninsurance protection with low levels of coverage and/or partial insurance may not prevent bank runs \n(Schich 2008). \n \nAll this suggests that Myanmar should not introduce deposit insurance without carefully \nconsidering the parameters and arrangements for the scheme. Without the necessary supervisory and \nfinancial underpinnings, and adequate market discipline, the government may incur substantial fiscal \nlosses in the event of a financial crisis. The best course would be for the government, with the help of \nthe donor agencies or the international financial institutions, to study the feasibility of a deposit \ninsurance, borrowing from good practice in developing countries at a similar stage in their financial \ndevelopment. It could also explore the possibility of a deposit insurance protection service backed by a \ncontingent development loan drawdown option from one of the international financial institutions.8 \n \n5.  Capital Market Development  \n \nThe banking system tends to dominate financial intermediation between savers and investors in low-\nincome countries. Over time, however, savers in search of higher returns, and users in search of \ncheaper capital develop direct contacts that eventually lead to the formation of capital markets. \nAmong capital markets, the money market precedes all others, given its central role in transmitting \ninformation about interest rates. A government bond market then tends to follow the creation of \nmoney markets, while the corporate bond and equity markets should only emerge once government \nbond markets are well-established.  \n \nPolicies to develop capital markets should observe this sequencing. Rushing these three stages \ncan lead to instability because risks can rapidly spread from one market to another. It is important that \nsequencing is done right to manage the risks of each market once they are established, before \nembarking on the next stage. The time horizon for completing all three stages could range from a \ndecade to several decades.  \n \nCapital markets take a long time to develop because they require a number of prerequisites: \nexchange, clearance, and settlement systems; money market infrastructure; a legal system to enforce \ncontracts; timely information about financial soundness and future prospects of companies; and \nadequate corporate governance standards that give investors the confidence that their investments \nwill not be stolen (Litan, Pomerleano, and Sundararajan 2003).  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n8   A contingent development loan drawdown option would give authorities the option of drawing down an international \nfinancial institution loan to finance the deposit insurance scheme, if there were to be an insurance claim on the scheme in \nthe event of sudden withdrawal of deposits from one or more domestic banks. Although international financial institutions \nhave provided contingent loans for other purposes (such as to protect against a surge in international interest rates), there \nhave been no loans thus far to protect against sudden deposit withdrawals. But there is no reason one cannot be designed, \nprovided the international financial institutions are satisfied with the broader finance sector reform program. \n\u00a0", "Developing Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   31 \n \nMeasures  that  have  long  gestation  periods  therefore  need  to  be  started  early,  such  as \ndeveloping a domestic investor base, developing an auction system and a secondary market for \ntreasury bonds (including an electronic securities depository), restructuring weak financial institutions, \nand building robust financial infrastructure (including a legal, accounting, and insolvency framework). \nThe capacity for prudential supervision, which helps prevent risky market practices and fraud, also \nneeds to evolve apace with the finance sector.  \n \nPolicies most supportive of capital market development tend to cover market infrastructure, \ntransparency, and corporate governance. The authorities should keep listing standards high at all \ntimes\u2014especially when the infrastructure to support financial disclosure is weak and well-trained legal, \naccounting, insolvency, and securities personnel are scarce. All accounts of financial and nonfinancial \ninstitutions need to meet international accounting standards (which MFRS would do) and these \naccounts should be audited and made publicly available in accordance with the law. Appendix 1 on \ncapital market development provides additional details. \n \nC.  Policies for a More Inclusive Financial System  \n \n1.  Branches  \n \nIncreasing the branch network of the banking system is important to increasing access to finance. The \ncurrent distribution of branches across the country understandably favors urban areas, because they \nreach the most customers and reduce the unit costs of banking. But this neglects rural areas. Increasing \nthe size of the branch network is important\u2014but it is not the only answer. Myanmar\u2019s banks are also \nconsidering other, more innovative approaches, such as telebanking and mobile banking.  \n \nWhile the CBM has significantly eased the regulatory requirements to open new branches, \nconsiderable room for reform remains. For example, there is no need to ensure ex ante that the ratio of \nthe capital base to the number of branches is kept constant (which requires banks to inject more \ncapital  each  time  they  open  a  branch).  After  all,  the  CBM  already  has  many  other  prudential \nregulations to safeguard the risk profile of banks. Another unnecessary requirement is the physical \ninspection  of  a  new  branch  before  approval  is  given.  All  this  does  is  increase  opportunities  for \ncorruption. Since commercial banks must compete on service standards, the CBM needs to recognize \nthat commercial banks\u2014especially private commercial banks\u2014have every incentive to decide where \nbest to locate their branches and ensure appropriate banking standards. The CBM should focus on the \noverall prudential standards for the banks, and occasionally, in their onsite inspections, visit banks to \nconfirm that systems meet CBM standards. \n \n2.  State-Owned Development Banking \n \nA key challenge facing Myanmar\u2019s policy makers is to increase the access of small firms and farms, and \nindividuals or households, to financial services, especially to credit. The 2003 banking crisis and other \nshocks to the financial system have led to an understandable emphasis on stability and prudence in the \nuse of collateral to underpin all loans. Consequently, however, banks deny loans to those who do not \nown land, even if their investments could generate high rates of return, while giving the lion\u2019s share of \nloans to those who own land and arguably, are in least need of financing. \n \nMyanmar\u2019s President has placed considerable emphasis on extending loans to those who \ncannot afford collateral\u2014and serious consideration is given to a state-owned credit guarantee agency \nthat will underwrite loans to small enterprises. Such agencies are only one of many kinds of specialized \n\u00a0", "32   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \nstate-owned development banks (SDBs). They are established in the belief that investments yielding \nhigh social returns can sometimes be ignored or underserviced by the private sector because of \nunattractive private returns or because of undue risk aversion (for example, the Gabon Development \nBank and Banco Nacional de Desarrollo Agr\u00edcola in Honduras). They can specialize in one sector, cut \nacross many sectors, or focus purely on external trade as Export-Import banks. Today, there are nearly \n750 such SDBs around the world, with different characteristics and varying ownership patterns\u2014\nprivate, public, or mixed (UN-DESA 2005). To develop viable and sustainable business models, a \ngrowing number of publicly owned SDBs are funding commercial activities while retaining government \nownership and their focus on national development (examples include the Malian Banque Nationale \nde D\u00e9veloppement Agricole and the National Bank for Development in Egypt) (UN-DESA 2005). \n \nInternational  experience  suggests  success  only  comes  to  those  SDBs  (including  credit \nguarantee agencies) with clearly defined mandates, high corporate governance standards, strong risk \nmanagement capability, proper regulation and supervision, and a strong management team (de Luna-\nMart\u00ednez and Vicente 2012) (Box 1). In fact, several SDBs around the world have failed due to an \nunviable business model, poor lending decisions, weak management, a large share of nonperforming \nloans, undue political interference, capture by interest groups, and lack of well-defined mandates \n(Gutierrez et al. 2011). In Indonesia, four development banks that collapsed because of bad loans in \nthe 1998 Asian financial crisis\u2014Indonesia Development Bank (Bank Pembangunan Indonesia), Bank \nDagang  Negara  Indonesia,  Bank  Bumi  Daya,  and  Bank  Expor-Impor\u2014are  typical  of  failed \ndevelopment banks.  \n \nBox 1: State-Owned Development Banks: Lessons of Experience \n \nDespite the wave of privatization of state-owned development banks (SDBs) since the 1980s, they still make up 25% on \naverage of the total assets of banking systems around the world. In developing countries, their market share tends to be \nhigher.  \n \nGovernments have established SDBs to provide credit and other financial services to individuals, firms, and \nstrategic sectors of the economy that private financial institutions were unable or unwilling to serve to the extent desired \nby policy makers. During the global financial crisis during 2008\u20132010, however, SDBs acquired a new role\u2014providing \ncountercyclical credit to private borrowers temporarily unable to access loans from private banks or capital markets. \n \nAn SDB is a state-owned financial institution with the mandate to promote socioeconomic development by \nfinancing specified economic activities, sectors, or markets. \n \nThe classic justification for SDBs is that they achieve public policy goals by correcting market failures that restrict \ncredit to areas of the economy considered important for development and social welfare. The traditional target sectors \ntend to be infrastructure, agriculture, and small and medium-sized enterprises. Other, less frequent target sectors have \nbeen renewable energy, climate change adaptation and mitigation, education, low-income housing, microenterprises, \ninnovation, and production chains. \n \nSDBs aim to correct \u201cinformation asymmetries\u201d that occur when banks cannot obtain accurate and verifiable \ninformation about the ability and willingness of borrowers to repay a loan. A common example is small borrowers who may \nnot have  financial statements, let alone audited ones, and thus lack adequate information to demonstrate their \ncreditworthiness. Another market failure could be the absence of systems guaranteeing compliance with financial \ncontracts\u2014most tend to be slow, costly, or inefficient\u2014especially because the costs of contract compliance are higher for \nsmall borrowers than for large firms. Externalities associated with lending to a particular sector for which private banks \noften overestimate the risk, or underestimate the benefits, or both, are a third market failure.  \ncontinued on next page \n \n \n \n\u00a0", "Developing Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   33 \nBox 1   continued \nMarket failures are best resolved through regulatory reforms that improve market information, increase creditor \nrights, ensure contract compliance, promote innovation, and expand collateral options. Governments should consider \nSDBs a temporary solution to increase access and serve a neglected sector while broader finance sector reforms mature. \nThey must therefore complement, not substitute, for systemic financial reforms. Without the latter, SDBs could crowd out \nprivate banks, incur financial losses, and drain the budget, or have little development impact. To combat pressure from \npolitical interests to maintain SDBs even after they cease to be useful, the government could create sunset clauses \nstipulating by law when an SDB should close or make it costly to extend its existence. \n \nSDBs do not have to provide financing directly\u2014they can instead guarantee private lending to target sectors. \nState-owned credit guarantee agencies are common in several countries. Such agencies have several advantages. First, \nthey encourage competition among private banks, which will help ensure the most efficient lending outcomes. Second, the \ncredit guarantee reduces the burden on the borrower to offer collateral. Third, the government can serve several target \nsectors through one institution and can therefore concentrate scarce expertise and ensure sound risk management. \nFinally, as conditions change and new priorities emerge, credit guarantee agencies can alter the guarantee choices they \noffer private banks without incurring significant adjustment costs. \n \nMost SDBs are capitalized through tax revenues, although low-cost foreign loans and aid (such as from the \nWorld Bank or the Asian Development Bank) can also be used. Budgetary sources of finance increase the financial \nautonomy of SDBs, avoid competition with other regular sources of bank funding (such as deposits and bonds), and allow \nSDBs to provide long-term finance for development projects at below market rates. Indeed, SDBs able to separate \nsubsidies from their financing sources can function more as development agencies than as financial intermediaries. For \nexample, if government financial support is in the form of an initial endowment, then SDBs will have an incentive to \nprovide their services in a financially sustainable manner. In addition, limiting the ability of SDBs to assume financial \nliabilities, including by taking deposits, may limit future fiscal costs for the government. \n \nMany SDB failures in the developing world have been caused by weak risk assessment capabilities, poor \nmanagement,  inadequate  monitoring  capacity,  poor  lending  decisions,  high  nonperforming  loans,  undue  political \ninterference, capture by interest groups, lack of well-defined mandates, widespread corruption, and negative real interest \nrates leading to open-ended state subsidies.  \n \nIn contrast, international experience shows that successful SDBs usually have clearly defined mandates, high \ncorporate  governance  standards,  strong  risk  management  capability,  proper  regulation  and  supervision,  a  strong \nmanagement team, and financial and legal arrangements that minimize budgetary support.  \n \nInternational  experience  also  shows  that  good-practice  policies  applied  to  SDBs  tend  to  increase  their \nprobability of success. For example, government should legally oblige the SDB to achieve a minimum return on capital. It \nshould  transfer  SDB  management  to  the  private  sector  and  protect  it  from  political  influence  by  guaranteeing \nindependence. Governing boards should be composed entirely of independent, professionally qualified members.  \n \nThe  governing  board  could  establish  incentives  supportive  of  good  development  outcomes  through \nperformance contracts and key performance indicators. It should insist that management use sunset clauses when \nlaunching a new program. Laws should explicitly prevent government bailout of a failed SDB. Management should \nencourage the private sector to share the risk of lending to underserved markets.  And it should use promarket instruments \nwhen supporting SDBs.  \n \nIn addition, government should introduce a legal obligation to achieve a minimum return on capital, place the \ndevelopment bank in the private sector under a management contract, and place independent and qualified finance \nprofessionals on the board of directors (de la Torre, Gozzi, and Schmukler 2007). \n \nSDBs in Myanmar can help broaden access to finance and be a vehicle for countercyclical monetary policy. But \nauthorities need to carefully craft the legal, institutional, and incentive frameworks to increase probability of success and \nminimize the burden on the exchequer. The government must also create organizational capabilities to manage these \ninstitutions professionally and without political interference, and implement promarket programs that supplement private \nsector initiatives, not substitute for them. \n \nSource: Author. \n \n \n\u00a0", "34   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \nThe biggest challenge development banks tend to face is the ability to manage risks. This reflects \nthe difficulties they face throughout the lending cycle, which includes the assessment of prospective \nclients\u2019 creditworthiness, the absence of accounting standards, the way they assess risks, and their ability \nto enforce contracts and collect on loans or execute collateral. Other big challenges they face are \nfinancial self-reliance (over 60% of development banks surveyed globally recently reported reliance on \nannual budgetary subsidies), the flexibility to acquire appropriate skills and professional managers, and \npolitical interference in decision making (de Luna-Mart\u00ednez and Vicente 2012). \n \nThat is not to say that development banks cannot be successful. In fact, several in other \ncountries  have  made  a  development  impact  and  remained  financially  sound.  These  experiences \nsuggest innovative ways for SDBs to improve their chances of success.9 \n \nBox 2: Financing Small and Medium-SizedEnterprises  \n \nCountries have two sets of choices to make in financing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The first is whether \ngovernment should set up a state-owned development bank (SDB) specialized in SME financing or require all SDBs to \ninclude SME financing as part of operations.  \n \nThe second has three options: support direct lending through SDBs, provide credit guarantees, or provide equity. \nIn each case, low interest loans are provided to SMEs through credit or equity lines, and SDBs then refinance themselves \neither through the budgetary mechanism, through central bank credit lines, or through credit lines financed by bilateral or \nmultilateral financial institutions. \n \nSDBs can provide SMEs working capital loans, loans denominated in local or foreign currency, as well as equity \nfinancing or even venture capital funds. Whatever the type of financing, SDBs need to acquire specialized knowledge of \nSMEs and the sector into which they are lending, in part to keep the cost of lending within reasonable bounds (since fixed \ncosts of information are high and loan amounts tend to be small) and to keep the nonperforming loan ratio within required \nprudential limits. \n \nThere is no consensus on the advantages or disadvantages of credit guarantees versus direct lending. Both tend \nto suffer from the same challenges of high fixed information costs, large losses from nonperforming assets, and \nmismanagement of programs and institutions (UNCTAD 2001). A useful mechanism to consider for exporting SMEs is for \nSDBs to guarantee letters of credit based on confirmed export orders and buyer letters of credit. But developing such a \nsystem requires considerable knowledge, expertise, and links with foreign banks in the major export markets. All this \nsuggests that Myanmar focus initially on pooling expertise and systems in one SDB, make it a center of excellence, and \nthen after a few years review the experience to decide on next steps. \n \nExperience from other countries, such as the Industrial Development Bank of India or Malaysia\u2019s Industrial \nDevelopment Finance Berhad, also suggests that SME finance needs to be accompanied with technical assistance for \nproject development and project design to ensure the finance is productive and efficient.  \nSource: Author. \n \nThe government needs to link its decision to establish a development bank with its program to \nrestructure  state  banks.  Those  state  banks  that  will  continue  will  need  to  be  transformed  into \ndevelopment banks\u2014leaving all commercial banking to the private sector. If the government decides \non a development bank arrangement, such as the Credit Guarantee Scheme for SME lending discussed \nin Box 2, it should do so in partnership with organizations such as the IFC or ADB, and build on the \nexperience of other Asian countries (such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand). \n \n   \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n9   For more insight, see Gutierrez et al. 2011 and Cih\u00e1k, M. and A.

Microfinance \n \nAccording to one estimate, demand for microfinance in Myanmar is four times greater than supply,10 \nwhich means that fewer than 20 out of 100 potential microfinance clients have access to formal \nfinancial services, with most people relying on family savings or costly alternatives such as informal \nmoneylenders (Duflos et al. 2013).  \n \nIt  is  therefore  not  surprising  that  the  government  has  placed  high  priority  on  delivering \nmicrofinance,  for  which  it  enacted  a  new  Microfinance  Law  in  November  2011  (together  with \nNotification 277 and accompanying instructions). The agency designated to license new microfinance \ninstitutions\u2014the  Myanmar  Microfinance  Supervisory  Enterprise\u2014has  already  licensed  142 \nmicrofinance providers, of which 3 are foreign and 50 have been given a license to collect deposits \n(which effectively makes them banks).  \n \nThe capital requirements for deposit-taking microfinance institutions, at $30,000, is very low \nand, if improperly managed and supervised, could cause insolvencies among microfinance agencies. \nMoreover, these new microfinance providers are already entering a crowded market. State banks, \ncooperatives, international and national nongovernment organizations, international organizations, \nspecialized agricultural development companies, informal lenders, semiformal village revolving funds, \nand community funds are already in the business of providing microfinance (Appendix 2). These \nagencies already reach some 2.8 million borrowers. The government may therefore want to pause in \nissuing  licenses,  study  the  microfinance  sector  more  carefully,  review  the  current  institutional \narrangements for licensing and supervision, and rethink its strategy to provide a sustainable system of \nmicrofinance. \n \n4.  Branchless Banking \n \nWhile  increased  branch  banking  will  extend  access  to  finance,  recent  innovations  in  branchless \nbanking can allow Myanmar to leapfrog other countries and provide its people access to finance more \nrapidly and cost-effectively. Branchless banking includes a range of options that are not mutually \nexclusive, including the following:  \n \ni.  ATMs (or bank branches in a box); banking vans (or bank branches on wheels).  \nii.  In-store point-of-sale systems (that permit cashless payments using credit, debit, or prepaid \ncards).  \niii.  Internet banking (permitting virtual connections with banks and their branches).  \niv.  Banking agents (outsourced bank branches).  \nv.  Mobile (telephone) banking (a bank branch in a pocket).  \n \nEach of these channels has proven itself in the marketplace and countries use them to varying \ndegrees (IFC 2012). In some cases, they have induced channel substitution, whether because of greater \nconvenience or lower cost to the user, and have shifted transactions that would otherwise have gone \nthrough a bank branch.  \n \nAnalysis  of  branchless  banking  gives  clear  evidence  of  its  many  benefits\u2014and  many  of \nMyanmar\u2019s private banks are gearing up to introduce various combinations of branchless banking \nchannels. Although still in its infancy, the Myanmar Payment Union, with 17 private banks as members, \nis already providing a platform for spreading an ATM network.

As the \nrapid expansion of Kenya\u2019s M-Pesa11 system has shown, expanding access need not result in financial \ninstability  if  appropriate  regulatory  and  supervisory  safeguards  are  combined  with  market \nliberalization policies.  \n \nIn particular, authorities should continue to emphasize know-your-customer requirements for \nfinancial  institutions  to  ensure  Myanmar  complies  with  international  standards  for  antimoney \nlaundering and combating the financing of terrorism initiatives. \n \nKenya\u2019s experience has also shown that when developing the policy framework for branchless \nbanking, all the relevant departments of government (central bank and the ministries of  finance, \ncommunications,  planning  and  economic  development)  must  ensure  close  dialogue  with  the \nprivate sector. \n \n \nVIII.  SEQUENCING REFORMS FOR FINANCE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT \n \nPolicy makers cannot implement all the actions described in the previous section at once. Indeed, and \nas noted, Myanmar\u2019s capacity constraints in all spheres, including in the finance sector, make it \nimperative that authorities sequence reforms carefully. The country cannot afford to implement \nreforms in the wrong order, which will simply waste effort. There may be considerable pressure from \ndifferent quarters\u2014not least from influential bankers themselves, or from the international donor \ncommunity\u2014to rush the reform process. But policy makers will need to focus on the national interest \nand on what makes most sense in Myanmar\u2019s particular circumstances. For example, as indicated \nearlier, it would make little sense to open the finance sector prematurely to 100% foreign-owned banks \nwithout first having a strong regulatory structure and building competitive and financially sound \ndomestic banks. Similarly, premature interest rate liberalization without well-functioning supervision \nand well-established and well-understood prudential norms would only lead to excessive risk taking \nand lead eventually to financial crisis. \n \nTo develop a stable and efficient finance sector that can support long-term development \nneeds, Myanmar should focus first on establishing strong foundations. Namely, it should put in place a \nlegal and institutional structure that provides financial institutions with regulatory clarity and central \nbank services that facilitate efficient real-time clearance and settlement of interbank claims and permit \nsound liquidity management. Many of these initial capacity-building initiatives are eminently feasible \nand the authorities can implement them with the help of the international community, notably the \ninternational financial institutions (the IMF, World Bank, and ADB) and key bilateral aid agencies, \nespecially  JICA,  the  Department  for  International  Development,  and  Australia\u2019s  Department  of \nForeign Affairs and Trade. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n11   M-Pesa is Kenya's mobile payment system.

Prepare the legal and regulatory ground for an interbank market for liquidity management. \nv.  Develop market-based central bank liquidity facilities to assist banks in periods of systemic \nliquidity shortages.  \nvi.  Finalize and enact the Financial Institution Law, which should include clarification on the role \nof FDI in the finance sector, exit policies and arrangements for banks, financial reporting \nrequirements, the use of MFRS, and so on. \nvii. Maintain the current interest rate policy. But the central bank should adjust the level of deposit \nand lending rates as macroeconomic conditions demand to ensure that they are positive in real \nterms and that the intermediation margin is adequate for banks to earn reasonable return on \ntheir capital. \nviii. Permit  commercial  banks  to  compete  on  service  standards  and  fees,  including  fees  for \nremittances. \nix.  Initiate audit of state banks\u2014preferably by international auditors (financed by donors). \nx.  Audit financial regulations to determine which regulations can be eliminated safely. \nxi.  Refrain from establishing more banks for the time being (including giving licenses to fully \nforeign-owned banks). \nxii. Remove unnecessary constraints to branch expansion by commercial banks. \nxiii. Initiate study of legal, regulatory, and institutional needs to support the rapid expansion of \nbranchless banking. \nxiv. Review the microfinance institutions sector and the appropriateness of the current legal, \nsupervisory,  and  licensing  system.  Temporarily  stop  issuance  of  microfinance  institution \nlicenses until the way forward is clear.  \n \nThese reforms implemented over the short-term will provide the foundations for the next \ngeneration of medium-term finance sector reforms, which the government should implement over the \nsubsequent 3 years. These reforms could include the following actions: \n \ni.  Enforce the MFRS for banks (which should be the responsibility of the central bank) and \ncorporates (which should be the responsibility of the Directorate for Investment and Company \nAdministration in the Ministry of Planning and National Development). \nii.  Fully implement the interbank electronic clearance, payments, and settlement system. \niii.  Introduce an auction system and a secondary market for treasury bonds. \niv.  Introduce an interbank market to permit better liquidity management. \nv.  Develop a market-based government bond market and develop benchmark interest rates. \nvi.  Launch an intensified CBM supervision capacity building program with international expertise. \nvii. Study the introduction of a deposit insurance arrangement. \nviii.

Work with the World Bank and ADB to prepare a state bank restructuring strategy, based on \nthe audit results of the four state banks. Allow one or, at most, two state development banks to \nsurvive.  Give  them  clear  mandates,  adequate  financial  resources,  independent  and \nprofessional  management, a corporate governance framework that protects them against \npolitical  interference,  and  an  incentive  structure  that  encourages  achievement  of  their \nmandate but combines it with prudent financial management. \n \nIntersection of Finance Sector Reforms with Other Reforms \n \nFinance sector reforms will be taking place alongside reforms in other sectors, and it is important that \nthey are well-coordinated. Thus, reforms to monetary and fiscal policies will have a bearing on the pace \nand sequencing of finance sector reforms. Similarly, policy makers should undertake reforms in the real \nsector  (such  as  trade,  agriculture,  land,  manufacturing,  and  investment  licensing  reforms)  in \ncoordination with finance sector reforms. Ideally, real sector reforms should precede finance sector \nreforms so that any changes in relative prices do not weaken the portfolio of banks. In Myanmar\u2019s \ncurrent situation, however, pragmatism demands that government should move ahead with finance \nsector reforms even as it is implementing real sector reforms. \n \nFiscal reforms will be critical for the smooth development of the finance sector for several \nreasons. First, better fiscal performance places less pressure on the banking system to perform quasi-\nfiscal functions. It is better that government agencies implement development programs with high \nsocial but low financial rates of return, and good fiscal performance ensures they can be financed \nthrough the budgetary system.  \n \nSecond, good fiscal performance allows targeted lending programs through the banking system \nto use budget-financed interest rate incentives rather than administratively suppressed interest rates, \nwhich impose a tax on depositors.  \n \nThird, smaller fiscal deficits reduce the likelihood of \u201ccrowding out\u201d the private sector, as more \nfinancial resources can be channeled through the banking system to private businesses rather than to \nthe government. This helps the government avoid forced placement of government debt in banks \n(which taxes the banking system rather than encourages it).  \n \nFourth, greater availability of fiscal resources will give the government more options when it \ncomes to restructuring state bank balance sheets and, if some need to be closed, assisting with \nmeeting their outstanding net liabilities.  \n \nFinally,  sound  fiscal  management  can  prove  helpful  in  times  of  financial  crisis  when  the \ngovernment may need to recapitalize a bank for strategic purposes and systemic stability. \n \n\u00a0", "\u00a0\nAPPENDIX 1: CAPITAL MARKET DEVELOPMENT \n \nA.  Money Market  \n \nThe money market forms the base of the capital market by supporting trading in the most liquid \ninstruments, including overnight loan facilities.

The \nprimary objective, however, should be to encourage banks to trade money and other liquid financial \ninstruments among themselves, and only when these prove inadequate should banks resort to trading \nwith the central bank.  \n \nRepurchase agreements (or repos) are a key instrument in money markets and an important \nmethod by which the central bank can exert indirect monetary control and influence liquidity in the \nfinancial system.12 Repos become particularly important when counterparty credit risks are high (as \nthey are in Myanmar), because they are a form of collateralized lending. The repo market, however, \nrequires an underlying legal structure. Participants should meet key prudential financial criteria\u2014such \nas minimum capital requirements and the ability to meet mandated liquidity ratios\u2014and should be \nsubject to central bank oversight.  \n \nB.  Government Bond Market Development \n \nThe government bond market is the next stage of capital market development, and its formation \nnormally follows the creation and development of the money market. The government bond market \nprovides a market-determined term structure of interest rates that reflects the opportunity cost of \nmoney at different maturities. The development of a term structure of interest rates in relatively risk-\nfree government bonds helps the introduction and development of new financial products of different \nmaturities that can assist lenders and borrowers manage risk better and provide benchmark discount \nrates that assist market participants undertake project cost\u2013benefit analysis and calculate one measure \nof the market value of companies. A government bond market also facilitates the conduct of monetary \npolicy by aiding with the transmission mechanism for interest rates and, together with the money \nmarket, gives financial institutions more instruments with which to manage liquidity.  \nThe development of a government bond market usually precedes the formation of corporate equity \nand bond markets. The following are prerequisites, however, for government bond markets to fulfill \ntheir required role: \n \ni.  Macroeconomic stability; \nii.  An efficient and liquid money market; \niii.  A clear articulation and announcement of the government\u2019s debt strategy; \niv.  A credible and regular supply of government debt securities to the market; \nv.  The presence of many potential investors; \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n12   Repurchase agreements are the sale of securities combined with an agreement for the seller to buy back the securities \nlater at a higher price, with the difference in the sale and the repurchase price acting as an implicit interest rate. \n\u00a0", "40   |   Appendix 1: Capital Market Development \nvi.  A neutral policy toward capital taxation that makes no distinction between incomes from \ndifferent types of financial investments (bank deposits, government bonds, corporate equity, \nand other financial instruments); \nvii. A settlement infrastructure and regulatory framework that facilitates secondary trading; and  \nviii. An effective and transparent legal framework that provides the legal underpinning to financial \ncontracts implicit in primary and secondary market trading.  \n \nTo establish a government bond market, the government must be committed to financing its \nborrowing requirement at market-based prices, permanently move away from forced placement, and \nensure standardized government securities (apart from maturity) with a concentration in a limited \nnumber of popular benchmark maturities. Key government measures would involve establishing a \nprimary dealer system, fostering repurchase (repo) transactions, and building benchmark security \nissues.  \n \nThe infrastructure for spot primary and secondary trading should be simple, safe, and secure\u2014\nand be able to handle volumes consistent with market needs. Because Myanmar\u2019s infrastructure is still \nweak, primary traders should be required to meet a minimum bidding commitment for primary trades \nand publicly offer two-way quotes for secondary trades, while building distribution channels, acting as \nintermediaries, and providing market information such as prices, volumes, and spreads. In return, they \nshould be granted certain privileges for their market-making role\u2014including exclusive or restricted \naccess to auctions, access to noncompetitive bidding, and liquidity support from the central bank. At \nthe same time, the authorities should take care that primary dealers do not collude to distort the price \nof securities for their benefit. \n \nThe usual sequence is to start with short-term bonds with maturities similar or close to \ninstruments available in the money market; but the transition to longer-term fixed rate debt must be \ngradual. It is important that bond markets are liquid at all times, which means active participation by \nintermediaries that have adequate capitalization and adopt appropriate risk management strategies, as \nwell as an efficient market infrastructure, including well-designed securities settlement arrangements. \n \nC.  Corporate and Equity Market Development \n \nCorporate  bond  and  equity  market  development  should  be  the  last  phase  of  capital  market \ndevelopment and should be undertaken only when the money market and government bond markets \nare functioning smoothly. Corporate bond markets would use the same infrastructure as government \nbonds, but equity markets will have different market infrastructure needs. Both markets help diversify \nsources of corporate finance away from banks and permit the availability of longer maturity funds, \nwhich banks typically do not provide.  \n \nIt is important that corporate bond and corporate equity market development is balanced. \nCorporate  bond  markets  without  equity  markets could  cause  excessive  leverage;  equity  markets \nwithout bond markets would not flourish as finance would be too expensive. Both require accurate and \ntimely disclosure of financial information from the issuer to make informed investment decisions and \nassess creditworthiness. The legal and institutional infrastructure should protect investors against \nfraud and misrepresentation. \n \nIn small economies like Myanmar, it is difficult to find enough large companies that can be \nlisted on the stock exchange. Those that list will not only cede some management control, but also \nexperience additional costs for accounting, legal, and reporting requirements and have less flexibility in \n\u00a0", "Appendix 1: Capital Market Development   |   41 \ndecision making. It is more probable that, as private companies grow larger, they will gradually list on \nthe stock exchange, initially with a small number and then later with a broader base of shareholders. \n \nWhen the number of total shares in the stock exchange is small, it makes considerable sense to \nhave periodic markets instead of continuous markets as a means of bringing together all trades at one \ntime, thereby deepening the market for a short period and enhancing the market\u2019s liquidity. \n \nEquity instruments are private property instruments, which require mechanisms to enforce \nlegal  ownership  rights  and  facilitate  ownership  transfer.  Court  systems  need  to  be  sufficiently \nsophisticated in dealing with complex commercial claims and be able to resolve disputes quickly and \nfairly. The court system, corporate governance structures, and the quality of financial disclosure \nstatements together should protect minority shareholders against related party transactions. \n \nEquity markets have traditionally developed through stock exchange mechanisms that bring \ntogether investors temporally and increase the liquidity of financial instruments. Settlement systems \nneed to be safe and efficient\u2014and Myanmar needs to consider carefully the 2001 recommendations \nof  the  Basel  Committee  on  Payment  and  Settlement  Systems  (CPSS)  and  the  International \nOrganization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) that set the international standard for clearing and \nsettlement systems (BIS and IOSCO 2001). \n \n \n\u00a0", "\u00a0\nAPPENDIX 2: MICROFINANCE PROVIDERS IN MYANMAR \n \nOutstanding Loan  Average Loan  Number of  Average Deposit \nNumber of  Number of  Portfolio  Outstanding  Deposit  Total Savings  Size  Supervisory \nCategory  Institutions  Branches/Outlets  Borrowers  (kyat)  (kyat)  Accounts  (kyat)  (kyat)  Regulated  Agency \nMinistry of \nMADBa  205  1,420,000  84,000,000,000  59,155  1,720,000  86,891,840,000  50,519  Yes  Finance \nState-owned  and Revenue \nbank  Ministry of \nMSLEb  143  208,778  31,341,790,000  150,120  ...  ...  ...
