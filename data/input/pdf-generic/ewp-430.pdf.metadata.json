The \nfinance sector is the lifeblood of any economy, and its smooth functioning is central to achieving these \ngoals. A well-functioning financial system must intermediate efficiently between savers and borrowers; \nmanage  risks  prudently;  provide  a  wide  variety  of  financial  services  to  firms,  farms,  and  households; \nmobilize savings effectively; identify and lend for sound investments; remain robust against shocks; and \nensure that access to finance is available to all.  \n\n \nBanking  system  structure.  Myanmar\u2019s  financial  system  now  comprises  4  state  banks,  22 \nprivate  banks  (nine  of  which  are  really  semigovernment  institutions),  42  representative  offices  of \nforeign  banks  and  foreign  finance  companies,  1  state-owned,  and  12  newly  licensed  insurance \ncompanies, and a nascent capital market. While the  state banks still dominate, private bank assets now \nsignificantly  exceed  state  banks\u2019  after  rapid  growth  in  recent  years.  A  new  microfinance  bank  was \nrecently  established  and  authorities  are  considering  license  applications  for  a  housing  bank  and  a \nlivestock development bank. Because the country does not yet permit foreign direct investment (FDI) \nin  banking,  it  has  representative  offices  of  foreign  banks  in  Yangon,  which  provide  liaison  support  to \nclients operating in the country. \n \n\nBanking  system  challenges.  By  most  measures,  Myanmar\u2019s  formal  financial  system  is  small \ncompared to other countries. Rural areas have limited access to banking services, and bank lending to \nagriculture  is  largely  restricted  to  the  state-owned  Myanma  Agricultural  Development  Bank,  which \nfaces  financial  and  operational  challenges  of  its  own  and  covers  only  a  small  share  of  the  financing \nneeds of farmers.  \n \nThe  banking  system  also  faces  other  challenges.  Collateral-based  lending  inevitably  restricts \nlending to land holders, although the government recently expanded collateral options to include key \nagricultural  export  goods.  State-imposed  social  responsibilities  encumber  state  banks,  which \nconsequently  have  little  incentive  to  manage  risk  and  are  in  parlous  financial  condition.  Dynamic \nprivate banks, meanwhile, are rapidly losing market share of lending to businesses. Private banks also \nhave  shortcomings.  Closely \nintegrated  private  commercial  groups  own  most  of  them,  and \nconsequently,  their  loan  portfolios  tend  to  be  concentrated  within  these  groups,  which  can  mask \nlarge risks.  \n\n \nGrowth  of  the  financial  system  in  general  and  the  banking  system  in  particular  is  also \nconstrained  by  weaknesses  in  basic  institutional  systems  and  infrastructure.  The  financial  system \nespecially  needs  an  automated  payments  clearance  system,  a  money  market  system  comprising  an \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n1   The 10 Burmese banks were Innwa Bank, Export Import Bank, Union Cooperative Bank, Rangoon Bank, Burmese National \nBank,  Myanmar  Eastern  Bank,  Burmese  Economic  Bank,  Myanmar  Central  Commercial  Bank,  Tavoy  Bank,  and  Upper \nBurma Bank. The 14 foreign banks were India Central Bank, Chartered Bank, Habib Overseas Bank, India Overseas Bank, \nMercantile  Bank,  United  Commercial  Bank,  Punjab  National  Bank,  India  State  Bank,  Hong  Kong  and  Shanghai  Banking \nCorporation, National and Grindlays Bank, Communication Bank, China People\u2019s Bank, Netherlands Trading Association \nBank, and the Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation. \n\n\f2   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \n\ninterbank market, a bond market, a repo market for modern liquidity management, and an electronic \nreal-time  data  system  that  connects  commercial  and  development  banks  with  the  central  bank \n(Nijathaworn et al. 2015). \n\nit \n\nliberalized  the  foreign  exchange  market  and  approved  a  new  FDI \n\n \nOngoing  banking  reforms. The government has made swift progress in reforming the policy \nand institutional environment for the finance sector since the launch of broad economic reforms. Most \nsignificantly, \nlaw,  with \naccompanying rules and regulations. The government has also made concerted effort to improve the \ncountry\u2019s  financial  infrastructure  by  enacting  new  laws  to  strengthen  the  financial  system,  most \nnotably  the  Central  Bank  Law  and  the  Securities  Exchange  Law.  It  has  launched  programs  with  the \nsupport of technical assistance from the international community to introduce an interbank clearance \nand settlement system, establish a stock exchange,  strengthen  bank supervision, develop the foreign \nexchange market, and prepare a finance sector development master plan. \n\n \nThe need for a finance sector development strategy. The rapid development of the finance \nsector,  while  ensuring  stability,  efficiency,  and  increasing  access  to  financial  services,  is  now  the \npriority. To achieve these objectives, the government needs to prepare a finance sector development \nstrategy,  using  as  a  starting  point  the  master  plan  it  is  preparing  with  the  help  of  the  International \nMonetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. The strategy should focus on three objectives\u2014increasing \nfinance sector efficiency, stability, and inclusion. It could also include the following elements: \n\n \nKey  reform  priorities  for  finance  sector  development.  The  highest  priority  in  the  financial \nsystem is to build strong institutional foundations for the banking system that will improve the efficiency \nof financial transactions and improve their safety and security. These would include:  \n\n \n\ni.  An  automated  clearance  system. The authorities are implementing this with the assistance \nof the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Banks in Myanmar spend a lot of time \nmoving  large  amounts  of  cash  from  bank  to  bank,  branch  to  branch,  and  to  and  from  the \ncentral bank, with a lot of time and labor devoted to counting money at each of these points \n(which,  despite  counting  machines,  are  prone  to  errors).  Introducing  a  clearance  system  for \nchecks will significantly improve banking efficiency. \n\nii.  An  automated  payments  system.  The  Central  Bank  of  Myanmar  (CBM)  is  introducing  this \nwith  JICA\u2019s  help,  in  tandem  with  the  clearance  system  (due  to  start  in  2015).  The  payments \nsettlement  system  and  the  clearance  system  have  to  be  fully  consistent  to  ensure  that \ntransfers between banks occur immediately after checks clear.  \n\niii.  A money market system. The next steps for this include the introduction of new short-term \ncentral bank financial instruments and an auction system; an interbank market together with a \nrepo  market  to  ameliorate  counterparty  risk,  CBM  liquidity  facilities  for  when  the  interbank \nmarket  proves  inadequate,  and  application  of  reserve  requirements  and  judicious  use  of \nliquidity ratios. The IMF and the World Bank are providing technical assistance to the CBM in \nall these areas. \n\niv.  A  credit  information  system.  This  should  have  legal  protection  to  encourage  its  activities, \nintegrity of the database, and that information is used only to advance public policies, privacy, \nand enforcement and supervision. \n\nv.  Financial  accounting  standards.  All  banks  and  corporates  should  eventually  use  the \nMyanmar  Financial  Records  Standard  (MFRS)  and  make  public  their  audited  bank  balance \nsheets and income statements. \n\n \n\nEnhancing  the  role  of  FDI  in  deliberate  steps.  The  entry  of  foreign-owned  banks  into \nMyanmar\u2019s  financial  system  is  desirable  because  of  the  potentially  beneficial  effects  for  the  banking \n\n\u00a0\n\n\fDeveloping Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   3 \n\nsystem\u2019s  efficiency  and  modernization.  But  the  authorities  need  to  be  careful  at  this  stage  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  financial  development  that  a  sudden  entry  of  foreign  banks  does  not  exacerbate  systemic \nfinance  sector  risks.  Given  weak  portfolios  in  many  domestic  banks  and  the  absence  of  a  strong \nregulatory  and  institutional  framework  supportive  of  stability  and  risk  management  in  the  banking \nsystem,  it  would  be  best  to  phase  in  the  entry  of  foreign  banks.  The  authorities  could  begin  by \nencouraging  strategic  partnerships  and  joint  ventures,  and  then  proceed  to  minority  foreign \nshareholdings  in  domestic  banks.  As  conditions  permit,  licenses  could  then  be  issued  for  majority \nforeign-owned  banks.  This  policy  transition  could  take  many  years,  as  it  will  depend  on  the \ndevelopment  of  the  institutional  and  regulatory  system,  and  the  speed  with  which  domestic  banks \nacquire  adequate  financial  and  competitive  strength.  However,  if  the  government  allows  the  full \nforeign ownership of banks immediately, it may need to apply ceilings on the market share that foreign \nbanks  can  acquire  in  the  initial  years  to  prevent  their  entry  from  generating  systemic  risks  in  the \ndomestic financial system.  \n\n \nPhasing in a new interest rate policy. Liberalizing interest rates too early in the absence of a \nstrong  financial  infrastructure  and  a  supervision  and  risk  management  system  can  lead  to  risky  bank \nbehavior  and  exacerbate  systemic  risks.  The  authorities  should  carefully  consider  the  sequencing  of \nthese actions. First, the CBM should continue to determine the interest rate structure administratively, \nbut take care that banks earn positive real returns on deposits and have an adequate intermediation \nmargin.  Second,  when  the  CBM\u2019s  capabilities  are  well-developed  and  a  suitably  strong  financial \ninfrastructure is in place, the central bank could consider replacing a fixed interest rate structure with a \nfloor for lending rates and a ceiling for  interest  rates. This will gradually introduce some competition \namong banks on the price of capital (at the margin). Finally, after perhaps a decade or two of strong \nfinance  sector  development,  the  government  could  consider  liberalizing  lending  rates  first  and  then, \nlater,  liberalizing  deposit  rates.  This  last  stage,  however,  should  not  be  a  current  concern  for  policy \nmakers. \n \nConsolidating  the  number  of  private  banks.  Given  Myanmar\u2019s  stage  of  development,  the \nnumber  of  commercial  banks  appears  to  be  more  than  ample.  Allowing  more  bank  entrants  at  this \nstage  would  lower  franchise  values,  encourage  risky  behavior,  and  increase  the  probability  of  bank \nfailures. Instead, the authorities should encourage mergers between banks to reduce their number\u2014\nand start with the state banks. \n\n \nApplying  regulations  equally  to  state  and  private  banks.  To  encourage  competition \nbetween banks, the CBM and the government should ensure that laws and rules relating to the finance \nsector apply equally to state banks and private banks. Another reform to encourage competition could \nbe  to  allow  banks  that  bid  successfully  at  foreign  exchange  auctions  to  indicate  an  account  of  their \nchoice for depositing auction-bought foreign exchange. To find other efficiency enhancing solutions, \nthe  CBM  should  regularly  consult  with  the  private  banks  and  with  representatives  of  the  public  and \nenterprises. \n \n\nRestructuring  state  banks  and  semigovernment  financial  institutions.  In  due  course,  the \ngovernment  should  return  to  the  CBM  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  all  central  banking  and  treasury \nfunctions  performed  by  state  banks,  so  that  state  banks  can  focus  on  their  banking  activities.  In \naddition,  state  banks,  as  well  as  the  nine  semigovernment  financial  institutions,  need  to  undergo \nthorough  international-standard  financial  and  performance  audits  (financed  by  donor  grants).  The \naudit results should be the basis for preparing a forward-looking strategy for their restructuring, which \ncould include closure, merger, privatization, or transformation into one, or at most two, well-financed \nand clearly focused development banks (or credit guarantee agencies). \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\f4   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \n\nEstablishing  state-owned  development  banks.  The  government\u2019s  decision  to  establish  a \ndevelopment  bank  will  link  closely  to  its  restructuring  program  for  state  banks.  Those  that  survive \nshould  focus  on  development  banking,  leaving  commercial  banking  to  the  private  sector.  If  the \ngovernment does decide to proceed with a development bank arrangement, such as a credit guarantee \nscheme for lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), it should do so in partnership with \norganizations  such  as  the  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC)  or  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB). It should also build on the experience of other Asian countries, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, \nand Thailand. \n \nStrengthening the CBM\u2019s supervisory capacity. The CBM, with the support of grant funding \nfrom  the  donor  community,  should  consider  hiring  20  world-class  banking  supervisors  from \nneighboring  Asian  countries  for  about  5  years.  These  supervisors  could  kick-start  the  CBM\u2019s \nsupervision capacity (and the adherence of banks to MFRS), and train CBM supervisors who can then \ntake over all supervision responsibilities within the 5-year period.  \n\n \n\n \n\nStreamlining  regulations.  The  CBM\u2019s  reform  of  its  regulatory  framework  should  focus  on \nmoving from direct, ex-ante approvals of transactions to indirect, ex-post supervision to ensure banks \noperate responsibly and within the CBM\u2019s guidelines. In addition, the central bank should conduct an \naudit  of  all  bank  regulations  and  eliminate  those  serving  little  purpose.  If  adopted,  this  would  be  an \nongoing  process  and  the  authorities  should  seek  the  support  of  advisors  from  the  international \nfinancial institutions, as well as from neighboring central banks. \n\nDeveloping  a  risk  management  framework.  The  authorities  should  establish  a  department \nwithin the CBM that identifies insolvent banks, assists in winding down their operations in an orderly \nfashion,  and  ensures  that  depositors  (especially  small  depositors)  are  protected  in  the  process,  and \nthat  any  risks  are  not  transferred  to  other  banks  or  financial  institutions.  In  other  words,  authorities \nshould not wait until insolvent institutions become illiquid and precipitate a systemic banking crisis. \n\n \nEstablishing a deposit insurance system. Depositors have limited information about the risk \nand  value  of  bank  assets,  which  can  lead  to  bank  runs  and  contagion  in  times  of  financial  stress. \nDeposit insurance can limit the risk of bank runs by guaranteeing that depositors will receive some, or \nall,  of  their  funds  if  banks  become  insolvent  or  illiquid.  Deposit  insurance  protection  can  only  be \nsuccessful if there is an effective supervisory, regulatory, institutional, and financial framework in place. \nThis will take some time to develop in Myanmar. In the meantime, with the assistance of international \nfinancial institutions, the  government  should study the feasibility of a deposit insurance scheme and \nthe needed preparatory steps to build a deposit insurance system that borrows from good practice in \ndeveloping economies at a similar stage of financial development. \n \n\nDeveloping the capital market. This will eventually be composed of the money, government \nbond,  corporate  bond,  and  equity  markets.  However,  developing  all  these  will  take  many  years,  even \ndecades.  The  government\u2019s  immediate  focus  should  be  to  develop  the  money  market  to  help  banks \nand  other  financial  institutions  manage  liquidity,  and  to  provide  the  foundation  for  establishing  a \ngovernment  bond  market.  It  should  also  begin  preparing  the  legal  and  institutional  infrastructure  for \nthe  bond  market.  This  will  entail  establishing  a  primary  dealer  system,  as  well  as  a  safe  and  secure \nsecondary  market  system,  building  a  broad  investor  base,  and  preparing  a  steady  pipeline  of  debt \nsecurities based on a credible government debt strategy. Work on developing the corporate bond and \nequity markets should only begin once the money and the government bond markets are fulfilling their \nroles  efficiently,  which  could  be  several  years  away.  In  the  meantime,  the  government  should  press \nahead with mandating that corporations meet MFRS accounting standards, subject their accounts to \nexternal audit, and make their audited accounts publicly available. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\fDeveloping Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   5 \n\n \nEasing restrictions on new bank branches. While the CBM has significantly eased regulatory \nrequirements to open new branches, considerable room remains for reform in this area. For example, \nthere is no need to impose a constant ratio of the capital base to the number of branches, which will \nrequire  that  banks  inject  more  capital  each  time  they  open  a  branch.  Since  private  banks  must \ncompete on service standards, the CBM needs to recognize that these banks have every incentive to \nidentify  branches  that  will  improve  service  standards  and  ensure  prudential  safeguards.  The  CBM \nshould focus on the overall prudential standards for banks and occasionally visit banks to see that their \nsystems meet CBM standards. \n\n \nReconsidering  the  strategy  for  microfinance.  The  rapid  expansion  of  the  microfinance \nnetwork  in  Myanmar  poses  financial  risks  to  the  overall  financial  system.  The  government  should \nimmediately  place  a  temporary  moratorium  on  new  licenses  for  microfinance  institutions,  and  then \ncarefully  review  developments  in  the  microfinance  sector,  as  well  as  the  current  institutional \narrangements  for  licensing  and  supervision.  Based  on  these  findings,  the  CBM  should  recalibrate  its \nstrategy  for  microfinance  institutions,  as  needed,  to  ensure  a  sustainable  and  vibrant  microfinance \nsystem. \n \nEncouraging  branchless  banking. A growing body of analysis points to the many benefits of \nbranchless  banking,  and  many  of  Myanmar\u2019s  private  banks  are  gearing  up  to  introduce  it.  Expanding \naccess  to  banking  services  through  innovative  approaches  will  help  Myanmar\u2019s  banks  increase \nefficiency and access to finance. This need not result in financial instability if the authorities combine \nappropriate  regulatory  and  supervisory  safeguards  with  market  liberalization  policies.  One  particular \nissue, however, needs careful handling\u2014the CBM must continue to emphasize know-your-customer \nrequirements  for  financial  institutions  to  ensure  Myanmar  complies  with  international  standards  for \nantimoney laundering and combating the financing of terrorism. \n\n \nSequencing  finance  sector  reforms.  This  paper  also  recommends  sequencing  for  these \nreforms so they address critically binding constraints to finance sector development and ensure reform \ndoes  not  overburden  Myanmar\u2019s  scarce  administrative  and  banking  skills.  Sequencing  should  initially \nemphasize  building  the  financial  infrastructure  to  underpin  the  banking  system,  finalizing  the  legal \nframework,  introducing  clearance  and  settlement  systems,  strengthening  the  CBM  (especially  its \nsupervision  capacity),  establishing  a  money  market,  easing  restrictions  on  new  bank  branches,  and \npreparing the ground for deeper structural changes in the banking system. Authorities should ensure \nthat  foreign  investment  in  the  banking  system  occurs  slowly  and  in  stages  to  be  consistent  with  the \nstrength of the regulatory framework and the efficiency and reach of domestic banks. Similarly, interest \nrate  reform  should  proceed  in  stages;  in  the  early  years  of  the  first  stage,  the  interest  rate  structure \nshould be determined administratively and adjusted periodically to keep interest rates positive in real \nterms as macroeconomic conditions demand. \n\n \nThe  second  stage  of  reforms,  over  the  short-  to  medium-term,  should  focus  on  broader \nstructural  changes  in  the  finance  sector.  These  should  include  restructuring  state  banks  and \nsemigovernment financial institutions\u2014and either closing, merging, or transforming them into one\u2014or \nat most two state-owned development banks\u2014and implementing a revamped microfinance strategy. \nThe second stage should also include developing an operational framework to deal with systemic risks; \nestablishing  a  government  bond  market  and  its  prerequisites,  which  include  legal,  regulatory,  and \ninstitutional  infrastructure;  preparing  the  regulatory  and  legal  framework  for  branchless  banking;  and \nputting in place a deposit insurance system. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\f6   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \n\n \n\nfunctions today.  \n\nstakeholders.  \n\nConsistency  with  other  reforms.  Myanmar\u2019s  finance  sector  reforms  will  be  taking  place \nalongside  reforms  in  other  sectors  and  it  is  important  that  all  are  consistent  and  coordinated  well.2 \nPragmatism demands that the government move ahead with finance sector reforms while reforms in \nthe real sector also get started. But it must ensure that any disruptions in the real sector do not raise \nbanks\u2019 nonperforming loan ratios above prescribed prudential limits. Even more importantly, policies to \nstrengthen  Myanmar\u2019s  fiscal  performance  will  have  major  bearing  on  the  outcome  of  finance  sector \nreforms. Strengthening the government\u2019s fiscal position will mean less pressure on the financial system \nto  play  a  quasi-fiscal  role.  It  will  also  ensure  that  adequate  government  resources  are  available  to \nfinance state bank restructuring, establish a development bank, deal with systemic risks in the banking \nsystem, and prevent crowding out of the finance sector. \n\n \nThe intention of this paper is not to provide a blueprint, but rather to indicate the issues that \nneed addressing and offer ways to address them. The first of its two main sections describes the legacy \nof the past and the current components of the financial system, key features of current finance sector \npolicies,  and  ongoing  reforms.  The  second  sets  out  the  main  elements  of  a  finance  sector  reform \nstrategy,  together  with  how  authorities  could  sequence  these  reforms  and  their  possible  interaction \nwith reforms in other parts of the economy. \n\n \nFor  clear  direction  and  sequencing  of  reforms,  the  government  needs  a  finance  sector \n\ndevelopment strategy with the following five important characteristics:  \n\ni.  Base  the  strategy  on  a  thorough  and  objective  understanding  of  the  financial  system  as  it \n\nii.  Clearly articulate the objectives of the strategy and ensure they are acceptable to all relevant \n\niii.  Recognize that not everything can be done at once and so the strategy should adopt a step-by-\nstep approach that ensures binding constraints to finance sector development are addressed \nfirst. The corollary of this will be to accept that while binding constraints are being addressed, \nother less important reforms may need to wait.  \n\niv.  Evaluate regularly and objectively to inform mid-course corrections in the reform strategy, as \n\nv.  Sequence  the  strategy  with  reforms  in  other  parts  of  the  economy,  notably  in  exchange  rate \n\nand fiscal policies, and in the real sector. \n\nneeded.  \n\n \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE LEGACY OF THE PAST \n\n \nAmong  banks  operating  in  Myanmar,  before  the  nationalization  of  1963,  were  such  global  banking \nmajors  of  the  times  as  Chartered  Bank,3  National  Grindlays  Bank,  and  Hong  Kong  and  Shanghai \nBanking Corporation. \n \n\nA series of policy shocks buffeted the sector thereafter, however, undermining trust in cash as \na  unit  of  value  and  in  the  security  of  banks,  as  noted  in  the  introduction.  Of  the  many  events  that \nshaped the country\u2019s banking system, this section highlights six particularly important shocks.  \n \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2   For a detailed discussion of the role of the finance sector in developing countries, see Hermes and Lensink (2013).  \n3   Chartered Bank became Standard Chartered Bank after merging with the Standard Bank of South Africa in 1969. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\fDeveloping Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   7 \n\n\uf0b7  Nationalization of banks in 1963. After the military takeover in 1962, the new government on \n26  February  1963  ordered  the  nationalization  of  all  private  banks,  eventually  incorporating \nthem into four state banks. The nationalization of most large enterprises followed. The number \nof  state  economic  enterprises  grew  rapidly,  as  a  result,  and  by  the  early  1980s,  their \nexpenditures  accounted  for  around  50%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).  Most  state \neconomic enterprises faced \u201csoft budget constraints\u201d in which managers had little incentive to \nmake profits, since the government pressured state banks to extend loans to cover losses. \n \n\n\uf0b7  Demonetization  of  1985\u20131987.  In  1985,  the  Ne  Win  administration  introduced  a  75-kyat \nnote  and  15-  and  35-kyat  notes  in  the  following  year.  The  government,  at  the  time, \ndemonetized the 50- and 100-kyat notes in circulation, following a grace period, during which \ncitizens  could  exchange  some  of  their  old  notes  for  new  ones.  However,  in  September  1987, \nthe government issued a series of 45- and 90-kyat notes and demonetized the 25-, 35-, and \n75-kyat  notes.4  This  time,  two-thirds  of  the  value  of  all  cash  in  circulation  was  effectively \ndeclared  illegal  with  no  option  to  convert  existing  notes  into  the  new  currency.  Sporadic \nprotests broke out among students unable to pay their university fees and, by 1988, these had \nbecome widespread, ultimately forcing General Ne Win to step down and triggering a bloody \narmy crackdown on 8 August 1988 (Egreteau 2009). The demonetization instilled widespread \nreluctance to hold currency. Farmers hoarded crops, while others bought what physical assets \nthey  could,  such  as  commodities  (including  gold),  land,  and  even  manufactured  goods,  with \nwhatever domestic currency they possessed. \n \n\n\uf0b7  Partial liberalization in the 1990s. During the early 1990s, the military leaders who succeeded \nGeneral Ne Win in 1988 introduced a partial liberalization of the domestic economy; as part of \nthat process, private banking was restarted. In 1990, the government promulgated the Central \nBank  of  Myanmar  Law  and  the  Financial  Institutions  of  Myanmar  Law,  and  the  first  private \nbank (Myanmar Citizens Bank) commenced operations in June 1992. By the end of 1992, four \nprivate banks were in business, and another four in 1993. By the end of 1997, Myanmar had 20 \nprivate banks. \n \n\n\uf0b7  The  banking  crisis  of  2003.  Given  the  lack  of  transparency  at  the  time,  its  origins  are \nsomewhat obscure, but it is thought to have started with the collapse of a number of trading \ncompanies that were acting as informal financial institutions. The contagion spread to banks, \nwhich were subsequently instructed to pull back all their loans to increase their own liquidity, \nwhich, in turn, created a real sector depression that further eroded the value of financial assets. \nYoma  Bank,  the  second  largest  private  bank  in  2003,  could  not  withstand  the  abrupt  and \nmassive withdrawal of deposits and had to resort to central bank support. Yoma Bank curtailed \noperations,  but  it  was  allowed  to  remain  open  purely  for  the  transfer  of  remittances.  It  took \nMyanmar until 2007 to recover from the banking crisis. \n\nExternal  factors  exacerbated  the  domestic  causes  of  the  crisis.  On  3  November  2003,  when \nthe  crisis  was  still  ongoing,  Financial  Action  Task  Force,  an  international  initiative  to  prevent \nmoney \n\u201cadditional \ncountermeasures\u201d on Myanmar because of the country\u2019s continuing failure to address \u201cmajor \ndeficiencies  in  its  antimoney  laundering  regime\u201d  (OECD  2003).  A  week  later,  the  United \nStates (US) Treasury announced that the Mayflower Bank and the Asia Wealth Bank were of \n\nlaundering  and  counter \n\nfinancing  of \n\nterrorism, \n\nimposed \n\nthe \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n4   The  reasons  behind  the  move  were  many.  One  was  to  lower  inflation  by  reducing  the  stock  of  money  in  circulation. \nAnother was to render stockpiles of notes held by insurgent groups worthless. A third was to destroy the black market. \nUnfortunately, demonetization achieved none of these aims, but instead caused widespread distress. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\f8   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \n\n\u201cprimary  money-laundering  concern.\u201d  It  directed  US  financial  institutions  to  take  \u201cspecial \nmeasures\u201d against the two banks, and took special action itself on grounds that the two banks \nwere  facilitating  money-laundering  operations  for  drug  trafficking  organizations  (Federal \nRegister 2003) . \n \n\n\uf0b7  Closure of Universal Bank in 2005. On 5 August 2005, troops closed and sealed branches of \nthe  Myanmar  Universal  Bank,  the  chair  and  managing  director  were  arrested,  and  Myanma \nEconomic  Bank  eventually  absorbed  the  bank.  It  is  still  not  clear  what  prompted  this \ngovernment  action.  Some  suggest  the  bank  was  involved  in  money  laundering,  which  the \ngovernment wanted to stop; others claim the action was to punish the bank\u2019s owners for being \ntoo closely connected to the previous prime minister, who had just been deposed and arrested \non corruption charges (The Irrawaddy 2005).  \n \n\n\uf0b7  The  minicrisis  of  2012. On 5 October 2012, following a rumor spread through social media, \nthere  was  a  run  on  KBZ  Bank,  Myanmar\u2019s  largest  private  bank.  Prompt  action  by  the  CBM, \nwhich  included  media  statements  emphasizing  the  financial  soundness  of  all  banks  and  the \ncentral bank\u2019s willingness to guarantee their finances, helped quell the panic. The episode was \na  reminder  of  the  fragility  of  the  banking  system,  but  also  highlighted  the  important  role \nappropriate central bank policies can play in ensuring stability. \n \nImplications for the current banking system. The policy and internal shocks that Myanmar\u2019s \nfinance  sector  suffered  left  several  legacies,  the  most  severe  of  which  is  a  lack  of  public  trust  in  the \nbanking system. The shocks left the banking system fragile and vulnerable to small shocks. At the same \ntime, the CBM, which was only recently made an independent institution, remains a product of its past. \nIt  has  limited  capacity  and  has  never  had  the  mandate  or  the  authority  to  oversee  state  banks.  It  is \ninstitutionally suspicious of the private banking system and its motivations, as reflected in many direct \ncentral bank restrictions on private banking activity, including strict limits on acceptable collateral for \nloans,  loan  maturity,  interest  rates  and  fees,  branch  openings,  and  daily  reporting  of  financials.  The \nemphasis  on  ex  ante  controls  has  meant  the  CBM  has  not  developed  the  capacity  to  implement \nindirect prudential regulations that give banks discretion to intermediate funds within well-defined risk \nparameters  and  ensure  their  adherence  to  these  regulations  through  offsite  and  onsite  supervision \n(Nijathaworn et al. 2015). \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM \n\n \n\nFigure  1  presents  the  main  components  of  Myanmar\u2019s  financial  system,  which  as  the  introduction \nnotes,  comprises  4  state  banks,  22  private  banks  (nine  of  them  really  just  semigovernment \ninstitutions), 42 representative offices of foreign banks and foreign finance companies, 1 state-owned, \nand 12 newly licensed insurance companies, 4 private leasing companies, and a nascent capital market. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\fDeveloping Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   9 \n\nFigure 1: Financial System Structure \n\nCentral Bank of Myanmar \n\nState-owned banks \n\nJoint venture banks \n\nPrivately owned banks\n\nRepresentative \noffices  \n\n1.

The  following  is  a  brief \noverview of the four state banks: \n\n \n\n\uf0b7  Myanmar  Economic  Bank  started  operations  in  1976  under  the  Bank  Law  of  1975.  It \nsubsequently assumed a new legal identity under the Financial Institutions Law of 1990, which \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\f10   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \n\nsuperseded  the  Bank  Law  of  1975.  The  bank  shoulders  several  development  and  social \nfunctions  on  behalf  of  the  government,  and  is  the  principal  banking  vehicle  for  lending  at \nconcessional interest rates to state enterprises, cooperative enterprises, and other state banks \nand organizations. The latter includes, for example, Myanma Agricultural Development Bank, \nthe  Myanmar  Small  Loans  Enterprise,  and  the  Government  Employees  Bank,  which  provides \ninterest  free  housing  loans  for  civil  servants.  Myanmar  Economic  Bank  has  increasingly  been \nproviding banking services to the private sector as well as foreign exchange and trade-related \nfinancial  services.  But  close  control  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  conservative  lending \npractices (the loan-deposit ratio is low) has meant high losses. The bank also provides treasury \nfunctions  as  part  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Revenue,  which  accounts  for  Myanmar \nEconomic Bank\u2019s extensive network of 320 branches, the largest in the country.  \n \n\n\uf0b7  Myanma  Foreign  Trade  Bank  was  also  established  by  the  government  under  the  Financial \nInstitutions Law of 1990. Its mandate is to provide trade finance and foreign exchange related \nbanking  to  the  government,  state  enterprises,  and  the  international  community  residing  in \nMyanmar.  It  is  also  responsible  for  managing  the  country\u2019s  official  foreign  currency  reserves. \nPrior  to  the  recent  economic  reforms,  Myanma  Foreign  Trade  Bank\u2019s  monopoly  access  to \nforeign exchange and its captive market meant that it did not have to compete for clients. As a \nresult,  service  standards  were  considered  very  weak  (even  in  Myanmar\u2019s  uncompetitive \nbanking sector). The bank is shrinking and losing its relevance, now that the CBM is responsible \nfor managing its own foreign exchange reserves, and that most banks, including private banks, \nhave  access  to  foreign  exchange,  and  some  have  begun  financing  foreign  exchange  related \nactivities. Although Myanma Foreign Trade Bank still has a competitive edge through its 140-\nplus  correspondent  banking  relationships  worldwide,  its  private  bank  competitors  are  rapidly \nestablishing  and  expanding  their  own  overseas  networks.  It  is  only  a  question  of  time  before \neven this element of the bank\u2019s remaining competitive edge evaporates.  \n \n\n\uf0b7  Myanma  Investment  and  Commercial  Bank  was  a  part  of  Myanmar  Economic  Bank  until \n1990,  when  it  became  a  separate  entity  under  the  Foreign  Institutions  Law  of  1990.  With \nbranches  mainly  in  Yangon  and  Mandalay,  its  primary  focus  is  business  and  its  mandate  to \nprovide domestic currency denominated loans for commercial, investment, and development \nactivities, as well as to act as a banking intermediary for foreign investment activities. \n \n\n\uf0b7  Myanma  Agricultural  Development  Bank,  run  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  provides \ninstitutional credit to small-scale farmers in its capacity as a government agency. It was created \nunder the Myanma Agricultural and Rural Development Bank Law of 1990 to provide banking \nservices  for  agriculture  and  was  set  the  specific  task  of  promoting  agricultural,  livestock,  and \nrural  enterprises,  including  processing  and  production.  Legally,  it  is  not  obliged  to  follow  the \nrequirements  of  the  Financial  Institutions  Law  of  1990,  but  it  does  so  in  some  key  areas, \nincluding the structure of its interest rates. Clients receive 10% interest on their deposits and \nmay  borrow  four  times  their  savings  at  15%  interest,  provided  they  use  the  funds  for  farm \ndevelopment.  \n \nThe bank has three types of loans: short-term, designed to finance the cultivation of one crop; \nmedium-term, with short maturities of 1 to 4 years; and long-term, with maturities of up to 10 \nyears (though these constitute a negligible share of the overall loan portfolio). It extends most \nshort-term cultivation  loans to farmer  groups that  are jointly  liable for repayment; here,  peer \npressure  replaces  collateral  to  encourage  repayment.  Term  loans,  on  the  other  hand,  are \nsecured by collateral, which cannot be land (as all land is the property of the state). Loan sizes \nare usually small in relation to farmer needs. This is in part because of the limitations imposed \n\n\u00a0\n\n\fDeveloping Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   11 \n\nby  collateral  requirements,  but  also  because  of  the  bank\u2019s  somewhat  parlous  financial \ncondition. Being a part of the Ministry of Agriculture, the bank encourages farmers to use their \nloans to purchase seeds, services, fertilizer, and equipment supplied by the ministry rather than \nprivate  sellers.  Myanma  Agricultural  Development  Bank\u2019s  rural  financing  responsibilities \nrequire it to run 14 regional offices, 164 branches, and 48 agency offices, most of which are co-\nlocated with ministry offices and service centers.  \n \n\nAssets by Bank Type, 2010\n \n\nNumber \nof Banksa \n4 \n19 \n\nAssets\n(Kyat billions) \n1,037.56 \n1,891.31 \n\nAssets \n(% of GDP) \n3.07 \n5.06 \n\n28 \n51 \n\n... \n\n2,928.87 \n\n... \n8.13 \n\nType of Bank \nState banks \nPrivate banks \nRepresentative \noffices \nTotal \n\n... = not applicable, GDP = gross domestic product. \na As of end-2013. \nSource: Min 2011. \n\n \nCapital  adequacy  requirements  for  state  banks  are  lower  than  for  private  banks,  and  state \nbanks (unlike private banks) are not subject to onsite supervision, although no exceptions are made in \nregulations  or  instructions.  State  banks  are  not  restricted  in  number  of  branches,  whereas  private \nbanks are required to increase their capital each time they open a new branch. Managing directors of \nthree  state  banks  are  on  the  CBM\u2019s  board  of  governors  (together  with  the  bank\u2019s  governor  and  one \ndeputy  governor).  The  authority  of  the  managing  directors  of  the  three  state  banks  occasionally \nexceeds  that  of  the  CBM\u2019s  governor,  which  makes  it  very  difficult  for  the  central  bank  to  properly \nsupervise the state banks.  \n\n \nThe Financial Institutions Law of 1990 included regulations that permitted the establishment \nand operation of private banks. This was the first of a three-stage reform program initiated in that year \nto liberalize private banking. The next two stages, which have so far not been implemented, involved \npermitting  private  banks  to  form  joint  ventures  with  foreign  banks  and  allowing  foreign  banks  to \noperate independently. It was not until 1992 before the first private banks became operational.  \n\n \nNot  all  private  banks  are  fully  private;  for  example,  nine  of  the  Myanmar\u2019s  22  banks  are \n\nsemigovernment institutions. They include the following: \n\n \n\n\uf0b7  Myawaddy  Bank  is  a  private  bank,  but  wholly  owned  by  Union  of  Myanmar  Economic \nHoldings,  a  military-run  conglomerate,  which  in  turn  is  ultimately  owned  by  the  Ministry  of \nDefence and its retired staff.

The  management  of  Union  of  Myanmar  Economic  Holdings  comprises  senior \nfigures within Myanmar\u2019s armed forces. Myawaddy Bank\u2019s head office in Yangon is located in a \nbuilding  that  was  once  the  headquarters  of  CBM,  reflecting  its  close  links  to  the  military \ngovernment prior to 2011. The bank does substantial business with local and semigovernment \nbodies, \nincluding  the  Yangon  City  Development  Committee  and  the  Border  Areas \nDevelopment Association. In 2005, Myawaddy Bank\u2019s semi-official status brought it under the \npurview  of  the  United  States  (US)  and  European  Union\u2019s  sanctions  against  the  Myanmar \n\n\u00a0\n\n\f12   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \n\nstate-owned  enterprises.  These  included  travel  restrictions  by  the  bank\u2019s  senior  officials,  as \nwell  as  prohibitions  against  US  and  European  individuals  and  entities  from  investing  in  the \nbank. \n \n\n\uf0b7  Small  and  Medium  Industrial  Development  Bank  is  a  public  company,  but  managed  by \ngovernment  officials  (for  example,  its  chair  is  always  the  Minister  of  Industry),  and  most \nprocedures are typical of  a government organization. Formerly known as Myanmar  Industrial \nDevelopment  Bank  founded  by  the  Myanmar  Industrial  Development  Council,  the  bank  was \nset up in 1995 to promote industrial development zones. As a result, the bank mainly provides \nfinancing  assistance  for  SMEs  in  industrial  zones  throughout  the  country,  usually  through  3-\nyear loans at an interest rate of 8.5% a year. Collateral requirements are very similar to those in \nprivate  commercial  banks.  The  bank  receives  technical  assistance  from  GIZ,  the  German \ntechnical  assistance  agency,  and \nrecently  signed  a  cooperation  memorandum  of \nunderstanding with the Industrial Bank of Korea. \n \n\n\uf0b7  Myanmar  Citizens  Bank  was  the  first  so-called  private  bank  to  be  established  in  1991 \nfollowing the promulgation of the Financial Institutions Law of 1990. It began operations on 2 \nJune  1992.  In  reality,  the  bank  is  government-owned,  with  the  government\u2019s  shareholding \nadministered through the Ministry of Commerce. It is considered a medium-sized bank and is \nlisted on the Myanmar Securities Exchange Center. As of January 2013, it had 255 employees \nand 8 branches. \n \n\n\uf0b7  Cooperative  Bank  operates  under  the  Ministry  of  Cooperatives  and  result  from  a  merger  of \nthree  cooperative  banks  in  2004.  The  three  banks\u2014CB  Bank  (established  in  1992),  Co-\noperative  Farmers  Bank  (1996),  and \n\u2018Co-operative  Promoters  Bank  (1996)\u2014ceded  to \nCooperative  Bank  several  branches  across  the  country  making  it  one  of  Myanmar\u2019s  largest \nbanks. The merger put Cooperative Bank at the top of a pyramid of thousands of cooperative \nsocieties, most of which have ceased functioning. Cooperative Bank is emerging as a dynamic \nbank, becoming the first to issue a cash card (a prepaid travel card issued in collaboration with \nMasterCard,  intended  for  Myanmar  residents  traveling  abroad).  It  has  the  largest  ATM \nnetwork of all the country\u2019s banks (Mahtani 2013). \n \n\n\uf0b7  Global Treasure Bank is owned by government-organized livestock and fisheries associations, \nbut its loans cover a wide range of sectors. The bank, which was formerly known as Myanmar \nLivestock and Fisheries Development Bank, has 60 branches nationally and has offered money \nremittances into Myanmar through Western Union since January 2013. \n \n\n\uf0b7  The other semigovernment banks are mostly city-based banks that partly operate as treasuries \nfor  local  governments  and  municipalities.  They  include  Yangon  City  Bank,  backed  by  the \nYangon  City  Development  Committee  of  the  municipal  authorities  in  Yangon;  Innwa  Bank, \nowned by the Myanmar Economic Corporation, run and owned by current and former military \nofficers;  Yadanabon  Bank,  with  just  one  branch;  and  Rural  Development  Bank  (previously \nknown as Sibin Thayer Bank), which mainly operates in border areas and is controlled by the \ncentral government.  \n\nThe 10 remaining private banks are genuine private banks.

KBZ Bank is rapidly modernizing, extending its widespread domestic \nremittance  services  to  overseas  customers,  providing  credit  card  and  ATM  services,  and \nimproving service standards. Although it was the object of a bank-run triggered by social media \nin  2012,  it  emerged  relatively  unscathed  and  observers  now  consider  it  among  the  most \nefficient and rapidly growing banks in Myanmar. \n \n\n\uf0b7  First  Private  Bank,  set  up  in  1992,  was  the  first  genuinely  privately  owned  bank,  and  it  has \n\nbecome one of the most profitable and dynamic private banks in the country. \n \n\n\uf0b7  Yoma  Bank  was  the  second  largest  private  bank  in  2003,  but  following  the  banking  crisis  of \nthat  year,  had  to  resort  to  emergency  financing  from  the  CBM  and  consequently  had  its \noperations restricted to remittance transfers only. Officials removed those restrictions in 2012, \nallowing  Yoma  Bank  to  resume  normal  operations.  It  is  now  in  the  process  of  filling  its  loan \nbook and should soon be an important competitor in the private banking system. \n \n\n\uf0b7  Asia Green Development Bank was one of four \u201ccrony banks\u201d hastily given a banking license \njust before the military handed over power to a civilian government in 2010. The other three \nare  Ayeyarwady  Bank,  United  Amara  Bank,  and  Myanmar  Apex  Bank.  Asia  Green \nDevelopment Bank has rapidly grown into one of Myanmar\u2019s most important private banks and \nis part of the Htoo Group, possibly Myanmar\u2019s largest conglomerate, which is owned by Tay Za \n(arguably Myanmar\u2019s richest businessmen and possibly its most politically influential one). The \nUS Treasury had previously sanctioned Tay Za, who it called a \"notorious henchman and arms \ndealer.\"  In  2013,  however,  the  US  Treasury  issued  a  general  license  to  the  bank,  one  of  four \nMyanmar  banks  allowed  to  transact  business  with  US  companies  (the  others  are  Myanmar \nEconomic Bank, Myanma Investment and Commercial Bank, and Ayeyarwady Bank). \n \n\n\uf0b7  Ayeyarwady Bank is owned by U Zaw Zaw and is part of the Max Myanmar Group. The bank \nwas a target of US sanctions, but since 2013, it has been allowed to transact business with US \ncompanies. It has 48 branches and is growing rapidly. \n \n\n\uf0b7  United Amara Bank is owned by Nay Aung as part of the IGE (originally International Group \nof  Entrepreneurs)  conglomerate,  which  has  interests  in  oil  and  gas,  petrol  retailing,  banking, \nagriculture, timber, and other sectors. \n \n\n\uf0b7  Myanmar Apex Bank is owned by Chit Khaing and is part of the Eden Group. The bank has 20 \n\nbranches and is rapidly modernizing its operations. \n \n\n\uf0b7  Myanmar Oriental Bank, established in 1993, is owned and operated by and for the Chinese \ncommunity in Myanmar.

These  are \nnot banks per se, although many have a license to collect deposits (See Section VII.C.3 for a detailed \ndiscussion  on  microfinance).  In  the  formal  sector,  Microfinance  Bank,  established  in  July  2013,  is \ncurrently  putting  its  financing  arrangements  in  place.  Supported  by  the  IFC  with  a  $2  million  loan,  it \nwas  set  up  by  Cambodia\u2019s  ACLEDA  Bank,  which  has  an  excellent  microfinance  track  record  in  that \ncountry.  \n \nTwo  bank  license  applications  are  before  the  CBM  awaiting  approval.  Construction  and \nHousing Development Bank has the support of the Ministry of Construction, but its share capital has \nyet to be funded. The other bank is for livestock development (Elevenmyanmar.com 2013). \n\n \nMyanmar does not yet permit FDI in banking. There are currently 28 representative offices of \nforeign banks in Yangon, which provide liaison support to clients operating in the country. Perhaps the \nmost visible is Standard Chartered, which, in an agreement signed between President Thein Sein and \nthe  United  Kingdom\u2019s  minister  of  trade  and  investment,  will  work  with  the  British  authorities  to \nin  Myanmar\u2019s  finance  sector  through  education,  training,  and  technology \ndevelop  capacity \ndevelopment (Thuya 2013).  \n\n \n\nThere are very few formal nonbank financial institutions. The Ministry of Finance\u2019s Insurance \nBusiness  Supervisory  Board  regulates  the  insurance  industry,  but  state-owned  Myanma  Insurance, \nMyanmar\u2019s  only  formal  insurance  company  until  2013,  performs  the  board\u2019s  work,  including  the \nregulatory oversight of the sector. The board granted domestic operators 12 new licenses in 2013 (to \nprovide a range of services similar to Myanma Insurance). These were Aung Myint Mo Min Insurance, \nAung  Thitsar  Oo  Insurance,  Ayeyar  Myanmar  Insurance,  Capital  Life  Insurance  Application,  Citizen \nBusiness Insurance Company, Excellent Fortune Insurance Company, First National Insurance, Global \nWorld  Insurance,  Grand  Guardian  Insurance,  IKBZ  Insurance,  Pillar  of  Truth  Insurance,  and  Yang \nInsurance Global. Eleven of them have already started operations. \n\n \nMyanmar has a nascent capital market. An estimated 60\u201370 private companies that operate in \nthe  country  have  shares  issued  to  the  public  and  permit  over-the-counter  trading  in  their  shares. \nShareholders  can  visit  a  company\u2019s  offices  to  buy  or  sell  shares  or  receive  company  performance \nupdates.  The  law  permits  only  Myanmar  citizens  to  buy  or  sell  shares.  None  of  these  companies, \nhowever,  use  the  Myanmar  Securities  Exchange  Center,  which  was  established  in  1996  as  a  joint \nventure  between  Myanmar  Economic  Bank  and  Japan's  Daiwa  Institute  of  Research.  So  far,  the \nexchange  lists  only  two  companies:    Myanmar  Citizen\u2019s  Bank  and  the  Forest  Products  Joint  Venture \nCorporation. Both are semigovernment institutions (the latter is the commercial arm of the Ministry of \nEnvironmental Conservation and Forestry), and there is virtually no trading in their shares. In 2012, the \nTokyo  Stock  Exchange  Group  and  Daiwa  Securities  Group  were  chosen  to  help  Myanmar  set  up  a \nstock exchange by 2015. \n\nIV. \n\nFINANCIAL SYSTEM PERFORMANCE \n\n \nEvery indication suggests that Myanmar\u2019s finance sector has been growing rapidly, such as the number \nof branches and ATMs, or the amount of deposits, loans, foreign exchange transactions, fund transfers, \nand remittances. Unfortunately, it is difficult to be precise about the rate of expansion because of the \n\n\u00a0\n\n\fDeveloping Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   15 \n\nscarcity of relevant data. Although banks do indeed submit data daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and \nannually  to  the  CBM,  this  information  is  not  publicly  available.  Even  so,  it  is  clear  that  the  genuinely \nprivate  banks  are  the  most  dynamic  participants  in  the  financial  system,  with  the  result  that  the  22 \nprivate and semigovernment banks together have recently outstripped the four state banks in terms of \ntotal financial assets. \n \n\nThis rapid growth, however, is from a small base. Myanmar\u2019s formal financial system is small by \nmost international standards, including bank assets as a share of GDP, number of bank branches per \n100,000 people, number of bank loans per 1,000 people (Figures 2 to 4). Decades of state ownership \nand policy shocks imposed on the system have contributed to a lack of confidence in  cash as a safe \nasset, and in banks as institutions capable of protecting financial assets. Rural areas have limited access \nto  banking  services,  and  bank  lending  to  agriculture  is  largely  restricted  to  the  Myanma  Agricultural \nDevelopment Bank, which covers only a small share of the financing needs of farmers (Kloeppinger-\nTodd and Sandar 2013).  \n \n\nFigure 2: Commercial Bank Branches in Low-Income Countries, 2012 \n(per 100,000 adults) \n \n\nThe Gambia\nNepal\nBangladesh\nKyrgyz Republic\nRwanda\nTajikistan\nKenya\nCambodia\nMozambique\nLiberia\nMalawi\nSierra Leone\nEthiopia\nHaiti\nUganda\nBurundi\nAfghanistan\nTanzania\nMyanmar\nMadagascar\nCongo, Dem.

Recently,  however,  the \nauthorities  expanded  collateral  options  to  include  key  agricultural  export  goods.  Here,  private  banks \nmanage risks by adjusting the loan value to the estimated value of the collateral. This ratio can be as \nlow as 30%, although most banks use 50%, and in cases where the borrower is considered particularly \ncreditworthy, the ratio can be higher. In the event of default, banks have successfully taken defaulters \nto  court  to  acquire  the  collateral,  but  some  banks  require  a  presigned  deed  of  sale  of  the  collateral, \nwhich can then be redeemed in the event of default (although this also requires court approval). \n\n \nState  banks  are  encumbered  by  social  responsibilities  imposed  by  the  state,  and  dynamic \nprivate banks are rapidly eroding their market share of lending to businesses. Indeed, despite privileged \ntreatment by the authorities\u2014for example, interest income on deposits with state banks is nontaxable \nand  state  banks  are  not  subject  to  CBM  oversight\u2014state  banks  are  unable  to  compete  with  their \nprivate  sector  competitors.  Furthermore,  state  banks  have  little  incentive  to  manage  risk,  in  part \nbecause  their  lending  is  largely  at  the  direction  of  government,  but  also  because  government \nguarantees ensure that banks will be recapitalized in the event of insolvency. \n\n \nPrivate banks also have shortcomings. Closely integrated private commercial groups own most \nand,  consequently,  their  loan  portfolios  tend  to  be  concentrated  within  the  group,  which  can  mask \nlarge risks. The CBM faces considerable challenges  in implementing regulations that restrict related-\nparty  lending,  which  include  a  20%  single  borrower  limit  and  a  20%  related-party  borrower  limit.  In \naddition, borrowers who do not belong to bank-owning conglomerates\u2014especially micro-, small-, and \nmedium-sized enterprises\u2014find it difficult to access finance from the formal banking system and must \nresort to borrowing from informal sources, where loans are usually at higher interest rates and shorter \nmaturities.  \n\n \nGrowth of the financial system, in general, and the banking system in particular, is constrained \nby weaknesses in basic institutional systems and infrastructure. The financial system, especially, needs \nan automated payments clearance system, a money market system for modern liquidity management, \nand an electronic real-time data system connecting banks with the CBM. Payments are predominately \ncash-based  and  often  involve  the  physical  movement  of  large  amounts  of  cash  across  the  country. \nProgress on an interbank payments system has begun, but check clearing between banks is still manual \nand the system for real time gross settlement is still in its planning stage.  \n\n \nAn  informal  and  unregulated  payments  network  predates  the  banking  system  by  some  30 \nyears.  Under  the  so-called  Hundi  system,  dealers  facilitate  payments  through  business  or  family \nnetworks, primarily between Myanmar and the rest of the world (Turnell 2009).  \n\n \nThere is no credit information system and the CBM is only just developing its offsite and onsite \nsupervision capabilities. The reporting systems of the banks and the CBM use fax, with no online, real-\ntime link. The CBM\u2019s capacity to analyze and digest this data is limited, and none of this information is \nmade  public.  The  absence  of  well-functioning  institutional  infrastructure  and  information  systems \nlimits  financial  development;  constrains  the  CBM\u2019s  ability  to  monitor,  analyze,  and  supervise  the \nbanking  system;  and  impedes  banks\u2019  liquidity  and  cash  management.  The  lack  of  debtor information \nalso  leads  banks  to  base  their  lending  on  collateral  and  guarantees,  and  limits  lending  to  small \nborrowers.  \n\n \n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\f18   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \n\nV. \n\nRECENT AND ONGOING REFORMS \n\n \nThe government has made considerable progress in quite a short period in implementing reforms that \nwill have a significant effect on finance sector development. These include policy changes affecting the \nfinancial system directly, as well as those affecting the system indirectly. The most significant example \nof  the  latter  is  the  liberalization  of  the  foreign  exchange  market.  A  daily  foreign  exchange  auction  is \nheld  and  the  official  exchange  rate  has  now  converged  to  the  \u201ckerb  market\u201d  rate.  The  generally  free \navailability of foreign exchange has increased business opportunities for banks, as it has for the entire \neconomy.  Since  October  2011,  the  CBM  has  granted  licenses  to  private  banks  for  the  operation  of \nforeign exchange counters, and since November 2011 for foreign exchange dealer licenses (including \nan  interbank  foreign  exchange  market  and  currency  remittance  services  for  Myanmar  citizens  living \nabroad).  A  new  FDI  law  was  approved  in  2012,  and  accompanying  rules  and  regulations  have  been \nissued.  The  law  provides  a  conducive  legal  framework  for  all  foreign  investment  in  the  country, \nincluding in the banking system, for example, by protecting foreign investors from the nationalization \nof their assets during the life of a project, and through any extension period approved by the Myanmar \nInvestment Commission. \n \n\nIn  addition,  the  government  has  approved  important  new  laws  that  will  contribute  to  the \ncountry\u2019s financial infrastructure. In July 2013, Myanmar\u2019s President approved the Central Bank Law, \nwhich  repeals  the  Central  Bank  of  Myanmar  Law  of  1990.  However,  the  rules,  regulations,  by-laws, \norders,  and  directives  issued  under  the  repealed  law  remain  in  force  until  a  new  body  of  associated \nregulations  is  issued.  The  main  feature  of  the  new  law  is  that  the  CBM  is  an  autonomous  body \nindependent of the Ministry of Finance. Once the associated regulations are issued, the central bank \nwill  have  two  main  objectives.  The  first  is  to  promote  efficient  payment  mechanisms,  and  ensure \nliquidity,  solvency,  and  proper  functioning  of  the  financial  system.  The  second  is  to  foster  monetary, \ncredit, and financial conditions conducive to sustainable economic development.  \n\n \nIn the furtherance of these objectives, the CBM will be able to independently adjust interest \nrates and conduct currency and exchange operations. It will be responsible for the supervision of banks \nonly\u2014nonbank  financial  institutions  and  microfinance  institutions  remain  under  the  supervisory \nauthority of the Ministry of Finance.  \n\n \nA nine-member governance board has been established, chaired by a newly appointed central \nbank governor. The President\u2019s office must nominate board members, and parliament approves them. \nThe newly independent central bank also plans to double staff and set up new departments. There will \nbe  committees  in  charge  of  financial  stability,  monetary  policy,  payment  systems,  and  foreign-\nexchange management. \n\n \nThe Central Bank Law of 2013 and its accompanying regulations will allow the CBM to revise \nits  earlier  practice  of  implementing  prudential  regulations  through  direct  interventions\u2014which  often \nrequired  ex-ante  approvals\u2014and  replace  them  with  indirect  approaches,  such  as  onsite  and  offsite \nsupervision, real-time electronic data transfer, and ex-post penalties against violations of central bank \nrequirements. The new central bank regulations will need to end the earlier practice of discriminating \nagainst  private  banks  and  providing  financial  support  and  regulatory  forbearance  in  favor  of  state \nbanks. For example, capital-deposit ratios are currently applied only to private banks, not state banks. \nDeposit  interest  income  from  state  banks  is  tax-free,  and  they  are  not  required  to  report  their \nfinancials as often as private banks. Private banks are effectively locked out from lending to agriculture, \nbecause state-owned Myanma Agricultural Development Bank operates as an agency of the Ministry \nof Agriculture and bundles inputs provided by state enterprises (for example, seeds and fertilizer) and \nfinancing, and the ministry buys the final agricultural product.  \n\n\u00a0\n\n\fDeveloping Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   19 \n\nA  new  Securities  Exchange  Law  enacted  in  July  2013  provides  the  framework  for  the \nestablishment  of  a  stock  exchange.  The  law  establishes  a  securities  and  exchange  commission  to \nsupervise  the  securities  market.  It  lists  the  licenses  needed  for  businesses  dealing  in  securities \nthe \n(brokerages,  underwriters, \nestablishment of an over-the-counter market, lists actions in violation of the Securities Exchange Law \n(such as insider trading)  and prescribes penalties,  and provides for  setting up a securities depository \nand  clearing  agency.  A  new  company  law  now  needs  to  accompany  the  Securities  Exchange  Law,  to \nprovide  for  improved  corporate  governance  and  accountancy  standards,  a  robust  regulatory  and \nreporting  framework,  and  a  level  of  transparency  that  will  give  domestic  and  international  investors \nadequate information for investment decisions. \n\ninvestment  advisors,  and  company \n\nrepresentatives),  allows \n\n \nA revised Financial Institutions Law is being drafted with the assistance of the World Bank to \nreplace  the  current  1990  law.  The  law  is  expected  to  set  out  the  licensing  requirements  for  private \nbanks,  corporate  governance  arrangements,  and  the  conditions  for  foreign  investor  participation  in \nbanking in Myanmar. \n\n \nBecause  of  these  and  other  reform  initiatives,  an  overall  policy  framework  for  the  banking \nsystem  is  gradually  taking  shape  and  is  broadly  consistent  with  international  norms  and  practices. \nIncreasingly, the challenge will not be the regulatory framework itself, but the capacity of government \ninstitutions,  especially  the  central  bank,  to  implement  these  laws  and  regulations  and  ensure  that  all \nbanks, state and private, follow them in spirit and to the letter. Private banks have already been given \ngreater  freedom  to  set  up  branches,  buy  and  sell  foreign  exchange,  hold  foreign  exchange  assets  on \ntheir balance sheets, and, in some cases, even lend indirectly to the agriculture sector. These freedoms \nappear to be piecemeal and not only need to be enshrined in new regulations, but applied to all banks \nequally. \n \nOther central bank policies and regulations governing bank operations may change from time \n\nto time depending on circumstances and requirements, and include the following: \n\n \n\nbase. \n\ni.  A  10%  risk-weighted  capital-adequacy  ratio,  which  is  reasonably  cautious,  although  the \ndefinitions  of  bank  capital,  risk  weightings,  and  nonperforming  loans  are  not  yet  based  on \ninternational standards. \n\nii.

The  CBM  regulates  interest  rates  for  deposits  and  lending.  Current  lending,  deposit,  and \ncentral bank rates are set at 13%, 8%, and 10%, respectively. CBM regulations actually permit \nbanks to set deposit rates within a range around prescribed levels, but complaints by smaller \nprivate  banks  unable  to  compete  against  larger,  more  modern  ones  led  to  \u201cinformal\u201d  CBM \ninstructions that any variation around the central rates would not be countenanced. \n \nMyanmar  is  making  concerted  efforts  to  improve  its  financial  infrastructure.  The  IMF \ncontinues to provide technical assistance for strengthening the CBM\u2019s capacity (two resident advisors \nwith the CBM will assist foreign exchange market development and bank supervision). It will also help \nin reorganizing the Ministry of Finance now that it has the task of reabsorbing all treasury functions the \nbanking system is currently conducting (IMF 2013a). The World Bank and IMF are helping prepare a \nfinance sector development master plan that includes a finance sector development strategy. JICA is \nhelping develop a CBM electronic network and a clearance and payments settlement system, and the \nTokyo Stock Exchange and Daiwa Institute of Research have been tasked with the development of the \nstock  exchange.  Myanmar  is  also  receiving  technical  assistance  support  from  the  Japan-ASEAN \nTechnical Assistance Fund to enhance the development of a bond market.  \n\n \nA Myanmar Payment Union has been established with 16 of the 22 private banks as members, \nwith a small number of retailers also in the system. The payment union is already offering a network of \nATMs that permit the withdrawal of cash for customers of participating banks. The plan is for it to link \nwith  international  card  networks,  such  as  VISA,  MasterCard,  the  Japan  Credit  Bureau,  and  China \nUnion  Pay,  all  of  which  have  signed  agreements  with  local  banks.  The  CBM,  for  the  first  time,  has \napproved the issuance of a prepaid, internationally accepted debit card by a semi-official private bank, \nCooperative  Bank,  which  is  collaborating  with  MasterCard.  Other  banks  have  also  applied  for \nintroducing similar prepaid debit card services.  \n\n \nThe  newly  established  Myanmar  Microfinance  Supervisory  Enterprise  is  authorized  to  issue \nlicenses  to  new  microfinance  companies\u2014domestic  or  foreign.  It  has  so  far  issued  166  licenses,  of \nwhich  50  are  licensed  to  issue  credit  as  well  as  accept  deposits  from  the  public  (effectively  making \nthem  banks).  According  to  the  IFC,  Myanmar  has  about  2.8  million  microfinance  clients,  with  total \nloans outstanding of about $242 million. The Myanma Agricultural Development Bank has the largest \ndomestic  microfinance  loan  portfolio  ($86  million).  The  United  Nations  Development  Program\u2019s \nmicrofinance  arm,  PACT,  is  the  largest  nongovernment  organization  in  the  microfinance  sector \n($29.5 million).  Only  three  foreign  microfinance  companies  have  been  given  a  license  to  operate  in \nMyanmar, including Acleda Bank of Cambodia, which started operations in partnership with the IFC. A \nnumber  of  nongovernment  organizations  operate  microfinance  projects;  one  of  them,  Proximity \nDesigns, has received a $2 million grant from the Government of Norway to expand operations. Some \ninternational  nongovernment  organizations  operating  microfinance  projects,  among  them  World \nVision, are considering applying for a commercial license so they can receive equity investments from \ndomestic and international partners to expand their loan portfolios. \n\n \n \n\nVI. \n\nNEED FOR A FINANCE SECTOR STRATEGY \n\n \nMyanmar\u2019s  finance  sector  has  made  big  strides  in  the  past  2  years  and  many  reform  initiatives  are \nunder  way.  It  is  important  to  maintain  the  momentum.  The  focus  will  need  to  be  the  rapid \ndevelopment  of  the  sector  while  ensuring  stability,  efficiency,  and  increasing  access  to  financial \nservices. \n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\fDeveloping Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   21 \n\nTo achieve this objective, the government will need to prepare a finance sector development \nstrategy,  using  as  a  starting  point  the  master  plan  being  prepared  with  the  help  of  the  IMF  and  the \nWorld  Bank.  Stakeholders,  the  finance  sector,  and  the  public  should  thoroughly  discuss  and \nunderstand  the  strategy.  It  will  eventually  need  to  have  the  full  support  of  the  government  and  the \ncountry\u2019s  highest  leadership,  and  should  receive  broad-based,  nonpartisan  support  from  parliament \nand other stakeholders.  \n\n \nThe finance sector development strategy should begin with a feasible and ambitious vision of \nthe  finance  sector  by,  say,  2030.  This  should  be  the  reference  point  for  all  government  policies  and \nprograms aimed at the development of the sector. It should also be consistent with and support the \ncountry\u2019s broader development goals. \n\n \nBy  2030,  Myanmar  should  have  a  stable,  strong,  competitive,  and  inclusive  financial  system \nthat  provides  access  to  financial  services  to  the  entire  population  (compared  to  10%  today),  and \ncontributes  to  growth  by  channeling  domestic  and  foreign  savings  effectively  and  efficiently  toward \nproductive  investments  throughout  the  economy.  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  and  Thailand  offer  good \nexamples of the way forward.  \n\n \nAt  the  core  of  the  financial  system  should  be  a  few  large  and  strong  domestic  private  banks \nthat employ economies of scale and scope to maintain low intermediation margins, provide a range of \nfinancial services efficiently and effectively, extend loans of different maturities, and, having built their \ncapital base, can compete successfully against foreign-owned banks in the domestic market.  \n\n \nFinancial services will be available to all through a healthy set of microfinance institutions and \none  or  two  large,  independent,  well-financed,  and  professionally  managed  development  banks  (or \ncredit  guarantee  agencies).  The  domestic  credit-to-GDP  ratio  should  have  reached  around  50% \n(around India\u2019s current level and higher than Indonesia\u2019s 35%). The CBM should focus on growth and \nprice  stability  as  twin  objectives,  ensure  systemic  stability  and  smooth  functioning  of  a  competitive \nbanking  system,  and  employ  market-friendly  instruments  to  conduct  monetary  policy.  The  nonbank \nfinance sector should be managed by specialized regulatory institutions, and include domestic private \ncompanies  (most  domestic  and  a  few  foreign)  in  diverse  areas  such  as  insurance,  hire-purchase, \npension fund management, and microfinance. The capital market should be a growing  source of risk \nequity and bond finance, and the stock market should aim for a capitalization-to-GDP ratio of around \n50%  (lower  than  India\u2019s  but  higher  than  Indonesia\u2019s  ratio  today)  although  it  would  still  be  small  in \nrelation to the banking system. \n\n \nAchieving this vision will first require a finance sector strategy to chart out the needed steps to \nthe desired goals in 2030. Properly sequencing reforms will be critical to avoid crises or missteps. The \nstrategy should also minimize the burden on Myanmar\u2019s limited administrative capabilities and focus \non overcoming constraints that \u201cbind\u201d the sector\u2019s development.  \n\n \nAlleviating  capacity  constraints  in  the  finance  sector\u2014whether  in  the  central  bank  or  in  the \nprivate  sector\u2014will  be  one  of  the  government\u2019s  highest  priorities  when  implementing  the  strategy. \nTraining  will  be  important,  but  not  enough;  policy  makers  must  also  consider  other  innovative \napproaches  to  overcome  capacity  bottlenecks,  including  technology  and  skills  from  abroad  to \ncomplement the domestic contingent. Of equal importance, implementing a financial strategy requires \ncoordinating the many different parts of government and needs guiding by policy makers at the highest \nlevel of government. Periodic evaluation of the progress of implementation and needed adjustments \nare also important.  \n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\f22   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \n\nThe central bank governor will need to lead implementation of most banking system reforms, \nwhich is why central bank independence and proper implementation of the new Central Bank Law are \nso  important.  The  CBM  also  needs  sufficient  skilled  staff  and  strong  leadership  to  provide  an \ninstitution  with  a  solid  knowledge  base  and  experience  in  banking,  finance,  central  bank  operations, \nand macroeconomic policy that has the confidence of the president, as well as the ministers of finance, \nand of planning and economic development.  \n\n \nEqually \n\nimportant,  the  government  will  need  to \n\nintroduce  a  financial-sector-reform \ncoordination  committee  at  the  highest  level,  led  by  the  central  bank  governor  and  the  Ministry  of \nFinance,  to  monitor  reform  strategy  progress  and  to  make  necessary  adjustments.  The  committee \nshould also be responsible for coordinating donors providing support to the finance sector and make \nsure the donor community supports Myanmar\u2019s priorities and avoid diverting attention to low-priority \nactivities. \n\n \n \n\n \n\nVII. \n\nKEY COMPONENTS OF A FORWARD-LOOKING FINANCE SECTOR  \n\nREFORM STRATEGY \n\n \nThe following section identifies these key components, building on all initiatives under way. It focuses \non  three  objectives  that  must  underpin  the  finance  sector  development  strategy:  increasing  finance \nsector efficiency, stability, and inclusion. \n \nA. \n\nPolicies and Measures to Increase Banking System Efficiency \n\nA  financial  system\u2019s  highest  priority  is  to  build  the  strong  institutional  foundations  for  the  banking \nsystem to improve the efficiency, safety, and security of financial transactions. This requires patience, \nconsistent  effort,  and,  perhaps  most  important,  a  change  in  attitude  in  the  government,  the  central \nbank,  and  private  commercial  banks.  Given  the  scale of  the  challenge,  Myanmar\u2019s  authorities  should \ntap the international community to help build domestic capacity, with a clear understanding on both \nsides that, except in very few situations, international expertise should not substitute for the domestic. \nInstead, it should transfer skills and systems that build domestic capabilities. The priorities in increasing \nfinance sector efficiency include the following:  \n  \n\n1. \n\nAutomate the Clearance System \n\n \nThe government has tasked JICA to implement the automation of the CBM clearance and payments \nsettlement  system.  If  approved,  JICA  will  be  issuing  a  request  for  proposal  soon,  and  the  system  is \nexpected to be operational by 2015. Clearance for now is manual and, as a result, most transactions are \ndone in cash. As noted, banks  spend a lot of time moving large amounts of  cash from bank to bank, \nbranch  to  branch,  or  to  and  from  the  central  bank\u2014and  considerable  time  and  manpower  counting \nmoney at each point (which, despite counting machines, is prone to errors). Introducing a clearance \nsystem for checks and/or electronic transfers will significantly improve banking efficiency. \n \n\n2. \n\nAutomate the Payments System \n\n \nThis is also being implemented with the help of JICA, in tandem with the clearance system, and is due \nto be operational by 2015. The payments settlement system and the clearance system have to be fully \nconsistent to ensure that banks make transfers immediately after checks and/or transfers are cleared.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\fDeveloping Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   23 \n\n3. \n\nMoney Market System \n\n \nThe challenge in the money market system5 is the excess deposits in the banking system (Figure 5). Yet \nthe  deposit  and  credit  auction  system  is  not  working  because  the  budget  for  it  is  not  adequate.  The \nCBM allows banks to deposit excess liquidity for 14 days at an interest rate capped at 4%, because of \nbudget limitations. This low interest rate gives banks little incentive to use the CBM\u2019s deposit facility, \nespecially  because  they  have  other  ways  to  use  their  excess  liquidity,  including  purchasing  treasury \nbonds  from  the  central  bank.  Next  steps  include  the  introduction  of  market-based  monetary \ninstruments  (such  as  central  bank  bills  issued  through  auctions)  that  help  banks  (and  eventually \nnonbank  financial  institutions)  manage  their  liquidity  based  on  price  incentives.  The  CBM\u2019s  primary \nobjective should be to encourage banks to trade money and other liquid financial instruments among \nthemselves;  only  when  these  prove  inadequate  should  CBM  provide  funds  through  its  own  liquidity \nfacilities.  In  this  regard,  repurchase  agreements  (repos)  will  be  a  key  instrument  and  an  important \nmethod for the central bank to exert indirect monetary control and influence liquidity in the financial \nsystem.6 Repos become particularly important when counterparty credit risks are high (as they are in \nMyanmar),  in  that  they  are  a  form  of  collateralized  lending.  The  repo  market,  however,  requires  an \nunderlying legal structure. Participants should meet key prudential financial criteria\u2014such as minimum \ncapital  requirements  and  the  ability  to  meet  mandated  liquidity  ratios\u2014and  should  be  subject  to \ncentral bank oversight. The CBM should also apply reserve requirements as an initial means to control \nliquidity,  and  design  a  framework  by  which  banks  can  access  the  central  bank\u2019s  standing  liquidity \nfacilities if their efforts in the interbank market are not successful. The money market will develop as \nthe  CBM  buys  and  sells  these  short-term  instruments,  adjusts  the  appropriate  level  of  required \nreserves in line with macroeconomic needs, and alleviates systemic liquidity shortages when they arise. \nThe IMF and the World Bank are providing technical assistance on all these initiatives. \n\nFigure 5: Commercial Banks\u2019 Outstanding Deposits and Loans \n \n\n \n\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\nm\n\n \nt\na\ny\nK\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\nOutstanding deposits\n\nOutstanding loans\n\n \n\nSource: IMF 2013b. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n5   For a more detailed discussion, see Nijathaworn et al. (2015).  \n6   Repos are the sale of securities combined with an agreement for the seller to buy back the securities later at a higher price, \n\nwith the difference in the sale and the repurchase price creating an implicit interest rate. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\f24   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \n\n4. \n\nCredit Information System \n\n \nAsymmetric information between lenders and borrowers is one of the most important market failures \nin financial markets. One way to partially correct this is with a credit information system in which all \nbanks have secure access to a smoothly functioning interbank information system that shares accurate \nand up-to-date data on the outstanding stock of debt of individual debtors, terms of loans, collateral \npledged,  and  repayment  records.  Myanmar  has  no  such  system  and  has  not  begun  work  on  one.  A \nmodern,  credit-based  economy  requires  access  to  complete,  accurate,  and  reliable  information  on \nborrowers\u2019 payment histories. Key features of a credit information system include the following:  \n\n \n\ni.  A  legal  framework.  Credit  information  systems  should  have  legal  protection  sufficient  to \nencourage their activities without eliminating incentives to maintain high levels of accuracy. \nii.  Operations.  Measures should be employed to safeguard information contained in the credit \n\ninformation system and incentives should exist to maintain the integrity of the database. \n\niii.  Public policy. The information collected and distributed by credit information systems can be \n\nused to advance public policies. \n\niv.  Privacy.  Subjects  of  information  in  credit  information  systems  should  have  access  to  their \ninformation  and  be  able  to  dispute  inaccurate  or  incomplete  information,  and  mechanisms \nshould exist to have such disputes investigated and have errors corrected. \n\nv.  Enforcement/supervision.  A  credit  information  system  could  permit  regulators  to  assess  an \ninstitution\u2019s  risk  exposure,  and  sanctions  for  violations  of  laws  regulating  credit  information \nsystems should be sufficiently stringent to encourage compliance. \n\n \n\n5. \n\nFinancial Accounting Standards \n\n \nThe  Myanmar  Financial  Records  Standards  (MFRS)  have  already  been  issued,  but  they  are  not \nenforced, and without this, the CBM\u2019s supervision of banks becomes very difficult. It is crucial that all \nbanks  and  firms  use  accounting  systems  that  meet  the  MFRS  so  that  balance  sheet,  profit-and-loss, \nand  income  and  expenditure  data\u2014as  well  as  all  typical  financial  ratios\u2014are  based  on  the  same \ndefinitions.  Although CBM supervisors analyze the daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly financials to \nmake  sure  banks  are  abiding  by  the  central  bank\u2019s  prudential  regulations,  the  absence  of  standards \nmakes it difficult to know that the numbers truly reflect the actual condition of the banks. In addition \nto ensuring that all banks use the MFRS, it is important that the CBM require all banks to publish their \naudited balance sheets and income statements, post them on bank websites, and issue them in printed \nform  for  the  public,  stakeholders,  and  relevant  parties.  The  1990  Financial  Institutions  Law  does  not \nrequire this, an oversight the new Financial Institutions Bill needs to correct. With real-time, electronic \naccess  to  commercial  banks  accounts  (which  should  be  part  of  the  JICA-supported  clearance  and \npayments  settlement  system),  CBM  supervisors  can  better  analyze  the  actual  submitted  data  for  a \nbetter understanding of banks\u2019 financial positions,  the riskiness  of their portfolios, and their solvency \nand  liquidity.  Introducing  MFRS  in  corporate  accounts  would  also  significantly  improve  the  ability  of \ncommercial banks to assess their credit risks. \n \n\n6. \n\nEnhance the Role of Foreign Direct Investment in Deliberate Steps  \n\n \nForeign  banks  can  now  only  run  representative  offices,  while  the  financial  institutions  law  forbids \nforeign  investment  in  domestic  banks.  Virtually  all  foreign  investors  and  traders  use  foreign  banks \nbased abroad to finance their operations in Myanmar. While this could continue, it obviously limits and \nimpedes  foreign  investments  in  Myanmar  and  prevents  state-of-the-art  financial  services  from \nentering the financial system and benefiting households and firms. Debate is ongoing whether and how \nforeign  banks  can  gradually  enter  the  banking  system.  The  authorities  are  considering  various \n\n\u00a0\n\n\fDeveloping Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   25 \n\npossibilities,  including  strategic  partnerships,  joint  ventures,  and,  finally,  full  ownership.  Many  private \nbanks  are  keen  to  enter  into  partnerships  or  joint  ventures  with  foreign  banks  to  get  access  to  new \ntechnology, training, finance, external retail branching networks, and better management. \n \n\nAuthorities  should  base  their  decisions  on  the  role  of  FDI  in  the  banking  system  and  a  clear \nunderstanding of its advantages for the finance sector and the  systemic finance sector risks that the \nimmediate entry of foreign banks could induce. International evidence shows that FDI in the banking \nsector can offer important benefits, but that it can indeed introduce risks (Claessens, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, \nand  Huizinga  2001).  Foreign  banks  can  help  build  a  more  robust  and  efficient  banking  system  by \nintroducing international practices and standards; by enhancing the quality, efficiency and breadth of \nfinancial services; and by accessing more stable sources of funds. These benefits could be substantial, \nprovided the regulatory and institutional framework for the financial system is strong. But if it is weak, \nthe benefits and costs of FDI depend on how it is phased in and what other reforms, particularly in the \nregulatory  and  institutional  framework,  accompany  it.  Countries  with  successful  experiences  opened \nup to foreign banking only after they already had well-developed institutional capacity and they were \nalready  engaging  in  rapid  domestic  deregulation.  Successful  examples  are  mainly  of  middle-income \nand  advanced  economies  such  as  Argentina,  Spain,  Ireland,  and  Portugal.  There  are  no  examples, \nhowever,  of  low-income  countries  that  opened  the  banking  sector  successfully  to  FDI  without \nnumerous restrictions and limits. \n \n\nIt  follows  that  the  Myanmar  authorities  for  the  time  being  may  wish  to  err  on  the  side  of \ncaution  when  considering  the  entry  of  foreign  banks.  The  institutional  infrastructure  and  regulatory \nframework for banking remain weak and will take years to strengthen. The premature entry of foreign \nbanks could lead to a rapid shift in the depositor base from domestic banks to the new foreign bank \nentrants,  placing  domestic  banks  at  risk  of  financial  distress  and  possibly  placing  the  solvency  of  the \nentire domestic financial system at risk as well.  \n\n \nThat  does  not  mean,  however,  that  FDI  in  banking  should  not  be  encouraged  at  all.  On  the \ncontrary, the authorities should encourage domestic banks to pursue strategic partnerships and joint \nventures  with  foreign  banks.  Some  of  these  cases  may  involve  accepting  foreign  share  capital  in  an \nexisting domestic bank. In others cases, a joint-venture bank could be established anew (although the \ngovernment would need to take care that the number of new banks be kept in check (See Consolidate \nthe Number of Commercial Banks on page 27).  \n\n \nIt  is  possible  that  in  the  first  few  years  no  foreign  banks  will  be  eager  to  assume  the  role  of \nminority  shareholder  in  a  Myanmar  bank.  This  should  not  discourage  the  government.  With  further \nstabilization and reform of the banking system along the lines suggested in this paper, foreign interest \nin joint ventures will pick up.  \n\n \nIn the meantime, the government, with support of bilateral donors, as well as the World Bank \nand ADB, should contract foreign banks to provide technical assistance and training to Myanmar bank \npersonnel  and  management.  In  subsequent  years,  when  the  authorities  are  convinced  that  the \nregulatory and institutional framework is in place and domestic banks are financially sound, they may \nconsider  licensing  majority  foreign-owned  bank  operations  in  Myanmar.  If,  on  the  other  hand  (and \nagainst  the  recommendations  contained  in  this  paper),  the  authorities  allow  full  foreign  ownership \nimmediately, then they would be prudent to impose a ceiling on the market share that foreign banks \ncan acquire to prevent the emergence of systemic risks in domestic banks.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n\f26   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \n\n7. \n\nInterest Rate Policy \n\n \nCurrently, interest rates are fixed (Figure 6)\u201410% is the central bank reference rate at which banks can \nborrow from the central bank. Deposit rates are set 2 percentage points below (8%) and lending rates 3% \nabove (13%). Treasury bond rates are also linked to the reference rate\u20148.5% for 2 years, 9.0% for 3 years, \nand 9.5% for 5 years. While CBM regulations allow banks to compete within a narrow band around these \ninterest  rates,  in  reality  the  CBM  requires  strict  adherence  to  the  actual  rates  (banks  are  expected  to \ncompete on service standards, not interest rates). The fixed interest rate structure has meant that real \ninterest rates have been very volatile, given the variance in inflation rates (Figure 7). The fixed interest \nrate  structure  also  permits  banks  to  use  their  excess  liquidity  to  purchase  treasury  bonds,  but  liquidity \nshortages are somewhat more difficult to manage in the absence of a secondary market. \n \n\nIn finance sector reform priorities, it is best that the CBM does not initially change its approach to \na fixed interest rate structure (it should adjust this structure from time to time to reflect macroeconomic \nconditions  and  monetary  policy  objectives),  but  focus  instead  on  building  the  financial  system\u2019s \ninfrastructure, including its own supervision system. Liberalizing interest rates too early in the absence of \na  strong  financial  infrastructure  and  supervision  and  risk  management  system  can  lead  to  risky  bank \nbehavior and exacerbate systemic risks. The appropriate sequence should be the following:  \n \n\ni.  First,  stick  to  the  CBM  establishing  the  interest  rate  structure  as  it  is  doing  now,  but  ensure  that \ndepositors earn positive real returns on deposits and banks have an adequate intermediation margin.  \nii.  Second, after some years and the development of CBM capacity and suitably strong financial \ninfrastructure, the central bank could consider replacing the fixed interest rate structure with a \nfloor  for  lending  rates  and  a  ceiling  for  interest  rates.  As  noted  in  the  introduction,  this  will \ngradually introduce some competition among banks on the price of capital (at the margin).  \niii.  Finally, after what could be more than a decade or two of strong finance sector development, \nthe  government  could  consider  liberalizing  lending  rates  first,  and  later  liberalizing  deposit \nrates. This last stage is not something that should concern policy makers now. \n\n \n\nFigure 6: Lending and Deposit Interest Rates, 1976\u20132012 \n\n%\n\n18\n\n16\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n6\n7\n9\n1\n\n8\n7\n9\n1\n\n0\n8\n9\n1\n\n2\n8\n9\n1\n\n4\n8\n9\n1\n\n6\n8\n9\n1\n\n8\n8\n9\n1\n\n0\n9\n9\n1\n\n2\n9\n9\n1\n\n4\n9\n9\n1\n\n6\n9\n9\n1\n\n8\n9\n9\n1\n\n0\n0\n0\n2\n\n2\n0\n0\n2\n\n4\n0\n0\n2\n\n6\n0\n0\n2\n\n8\n0\n0\n2\n\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n2\n1\n0\n2\n\nSource: World Bank.

Are more banks better than fewer? Research in many countries suggests that authorities need to \nbalance the increased competition that comes from having more banks in a financial system with the \neconomies of scale that come with larger banks and the franchise value of banks that can affect their \napproach  to  risk  taking.  If  franchise  values  decline  too  much,  banks  can  become  risk  prone  just  to \nsurvive in a highly competitive environment, generating systemic risks (Caprio 2010).7 In this sense, the \nfinance  sector  is  very  different  from  other  services  and  goods  sectors.  So,  for  now,  Myanmar\u2019s \ncommercial  bank  contingent  appears  more  than  ample.  Not  only  would  it  make  little  sense  to  allow \nmore  bank  entrants  at  this  stage,  it  would  be  appropriate  for  the  authorities  to  encourage  mergers \nbetween banks to reduce the number, starting with the state banks (See Restructure State Banks on \npage 28). \n \n\n9. \n\nApply Regulations Equally to State and Private Banks  \n\n \nAs noted earlier, with weak central bank oversight and supervision, it would be inappropriate to allow \nbanks to compete for deposits and borrowers on interest rates. Not allowing them will avoid excessive \nrisk-taking  and  lower  the  probability  of  bank  failures.  At  the  same  time,  however,  banks  must  be \nallowed  to  compete  based  on  service  standards  and  fees.  An  important  component  of  bank  income \naccrues  from  fees  for  remittances,  whether  domestically  or  internationally.  The  CBM  has  fixed  the \nremittance  fee  at  0.125%  of  the  transfer  amount\u2014but  such  fees  could  be  subject  to  competition \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n7   Also, see Agoraki, Delis, and Pasiouras 2009.  \n\n\f28   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \n\nbetween banks. Similarly, to encourage bank competition, the CBM and the government should ensure \nthat  rules  under  the  Financial  Institutions  Law  are  applied  equally  to  state  banks  and  private  banks. \nThere is no reason to treat the Myanma Economic Bank, Myanma Foreign Trade Bank, and Myanma \nInvestment and Commercial Bank (MICB) differently when it comes to prudential risk ratios or the tax \ntreatment of income from deposits.  \n \n\nThe CBM could also help reduce costs and encourage competition by allowing banks that bid \nsuccessfully  at  the  foreign  exchange  auction  to  indicate  an  account  of  their  choice  to  deposit  this \nforeign  exchange.  At  present,  the  foreign  exchange  is  deposited  at  the  head  office  account  of  the \nprivate  banks\u2014when  the  money  is  needed  outside  the  country  to  pay  for  import  purchases  of  bank \nclients.  Other  similar,  low-cost  solutions  would  significantly  increase  banking  system  efficiency;  the \ncentral bank should regularly consult private banks and public representatives (and enterprises) to find \nthem. \n\n \n10. \n\nRestructure State Banks \n\n \nPolicy makers need to consider the role of the four state banks in the future banking system carefully. \nAuthorities should return the central banking and treasury functions of these banks to the central bank \nand the Ministry of Finance in due course, so that the state banks can focus on their banking activities. \n \n\nIn  addition,  the  government  could  consider  two  alternative  approaches  to  separating  the \nAgricultural  Development  Bank  from  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture.  The  first  would  make  it  a  separate \nand restructured state development bank that would need to be adequately capitalized and focused \nit  could  transfer  the \nsolely  on  supporting  small-scale  agricultural  borrowers.  Alternatively, \nresponsibilities  of  the  Agricultural  Development  Bank  to  the  microfinance  banking  system  as  well  as \nthe remaining private and state banks.  \n\n \nSimilarly,  the  Myanma  Foreign  Trade  Bank  (which  would  need to  return  the  external  reserve \nmanagement functions to the CBM) could transfer its international fund transfer responsibilities to the \nMICB and allow the MICB to compete with private banks. Now that they have their foreign exchange \nlicenses and are developing their correspondent banking networks abroad, private banks are operating \nin the same space. \n\n \nFinally,  the  Myanma  Economic  Bank  and  the  MICB  should  undergo  thorough  international-\nstandard financial audits (again, financed by donor grants). This would thoroughly assess their current \nfinancial  condition.  Based  on  the  results,  the  authorities  should  fully  capitalize  these  two  banks  in \naccordance  with  CBM  requirements  (which  should  be  the  same  for  all  banks).  They  should  also \nchange their mandate from commercial banking (which private commercial banks should provide) to \ndevelopment  banking.  Finally,  the  CBM  should  subject  them  to  the  same  prudential  standards  and \nsupervision oversight as required for private banks. Good examples of other countries adopting similar \nreforms  are  Viet  Nam,  when  it  applied  ADB  resources  to  audit  two  state  banks  before  restructuring \nthem, and Indonesia, which used donor resources to finance audits of state and private banks prior to \nclosing or restructuring them. \n\nB. \n\nPolicies to Promote Financial System Stability \n\n \n\n \n\n1. \n\nStrengthening Central Bank of Myanmar Supervision Capacity \n\n \nThe  CBM\u2019s  bank  supervision  department  has  fewer  than  20  bank  supervisors  (split  equally  between \nonsite and offsite supervision duties). The CBM needs more supervisors and to train all its supervisors \n\n\u00a0\n\n\fDeveloping Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   29 \n\nin  the  latest  techniques.  This  will  take  time,  but  the  demand  for  high-quality  supervision  capacity  is \nurgent.  The  CBM,  with  the  support  of  grant  funding  from  the  donor  community,  should  therefore \nseriously  consider  hiring  20  world-class  supervisors  from  neighboring  Asian  countries,  and  therefore \nare familiar with Asian conditions. These supervisors could be contracted for a period of about 5 years \nto kick-start the CBM\u2019s supervision capacity (and the adherence of banks to MFRS), and to train CBM \nsupervisors who can then take over all supervision responsibilities within the 5 years.  \n\n \n2. \n\n \n3. \n\nStreamlining Regulations \n\n \nThe thrust of the CBM\u2019s reform of its banking regulatory framework will need to be from direct and ex \nante  oversight  and  approvals  of  transactions  to  indirect  and  ex  post  supervision  to  ensure  banks  are \noperating responsibly and within central bank guidelines. More regulations do not necessarily translate \nto more stability, and could instead smother banking development. Smarter regulation is needed. One \napproach to achieve this would be to conduct an audit of all banking regulations and eliminate those \nthat serve little purpose\u2014for example, eliminate all restrictions that impede private banks from lending \nto  agriculture,  eliminate  restrictions  to  opening  new  branches  (including  incremental  capital  and \nstaffing  requirements),  and  so  on.  This  will  be  ongoing  and  could  be  supported  by  advisors  from \ninternational financial institutions and other central banks. \n\nDeveloping  a  Risk  Management  Framework,  Including  a  Resolution  Framework \nand Process for Insolvent Banks \n\n \nA key part of ensuring financial system stability is to allow the orderly exit of financial institutions that \nbecome  insolvent  and  have  little  chance  of  regaining  solvency.  Authorities  should  not  wait  for \ninsolvent institutions to become illiquid and precipitate a systemic crisis, nor should they try to prop up \ninstitutions with open-ended financial support (whether from the budget or from the CBM\u2019s liquidity \nfacilities),  or  to  curtail  competition  to  protect  the  viability  of  certain  banks.  Instead,  the  CBM  or  the \nMinistry  of  Finance  should  consider  establishing  a  department  that  can  assist  in  the  orderly  winding \ndown of unviable banks, ensuring that depositors, especially small ones, are protected, and that risks \nare  not  transferred  to  other  banks  or  financial  institutions.  Such  a  department  could  also  be \nresponsible for restructuring state banks to make them viable.  \n \n\n4. \n\nEstablishing a Deposit Insurance System \n\n \nDepositors  have  limited  information  about  the  risk  and  value  of  bank  assets,  which  during  crisis  can \nlead  to  bank  runs  and  contagion.  Deposit  insurance  can  limit  these  risks  by  guaranteeing  depositors \nthat they will receive some, or all, of their deposited funds if their banks become insolvent or illiquid \n(Angkinand and Wihlborg 2008).  \n \n\nMyanmar\u2019s  deposit  insurance  system  is  currently  the  responsibility  of  the  state-owned \nMyanma  Insurance  Agency,  which  is  also  responsible  for  licensing  other  insurance  agencies  and \nsupervising their activities. While it may have experience in standard insurance activities, such as life \nand health insurance, it has limited experience with deposit insurance, in which typical actuarial tables \ncannot calculate the risks, but a deep understanding of bank function, and where risks are likely, can. \nFor this reason, deposit insurance agencies, typically, are separately funded agencies that work closely \nwith the central bank. \n \n\nClearly,  deposit  insurance  alone  cannot  be  a  panacea  for  addressing  financial  instability  in \nbanks.  On  the  contrary,  deposit  insurance  will  be  unsuccessful  without  effective  bank  supervision, \nemergency liquidity lines, and strong prudential standards implemented by the CBM.  \n\n\u00a0\n\n\f30   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \n\n \n\nAt the same time, if the CBM were to provide deposit insurance protection, it would design it \nto encourage prudential standards and discourage risky behavior (moral hazard). The central bank can \nachieve  this  by  introducing  penalties  for  risky  behavior  by  bank  owners  and  management.  Deposit \ninsurance protection, if available, should only cover small savers, placing shareholder equity at stake in \nthe event of bank insolvency. To further avoid moral hazard, not only should the government refrain \nfrom issuing guarantees on an ad hoc basis for favored private or public projects, it should also insist \nthat  adequate  risk-based  premiums  are  collected  to  finance  any  provision  of  a  deposit  protection \nservice.  In  Myanmar,  where  bank  supervision  and  other  prudential  mechanisms  are  weak  or  largely \nabsent,  deposit  insurance\u2014albeit  limited  in  what  it  can  do\u2014can  still  contribute  toward  the \nstabilization  of  the  banking  system.  At  the  same  time,  it  is  important  to  remember  that  deposit \ninsurance protection with low levels of coverage and/or partial insurance may not prevent bank runs \n(Schich 2008). \n \nAll  this  suggests  that  Myanmar  should  not  introduce  deposit  insurance  without  carefully \nconsidering the parameters and arrangements for the scheme. Without the necessary supervisory and \nfinancial underpinnings, and adequate market discipline, the government may incur substantial fiscal \nlosses in the event of a financial crisis. The best course would be for the government, with the help of \nthe  donor  agencies  or  the  international  financial  institutions,  to  study  the  feasibility  of  a  deposit \ninsurance,  borrowing  from  good  practice  in  developing  countries  at  a  similar  stage  in  their  financial \ndevelopment. It could also explore the possibility of a deposit insurance protection service backed by a \ncontingent development loan drawdown option from one of the international financial institutions.8 \n\n \n5. \n\nCapital Market Development  \n\n \nThe banking system tends to dominate financial intermediation between savers and investors in low-\nincome  countries.  Over  time,  however,  savers  in  search  of  higher  returns,  and  users  in  search  of \ncheaper  capital  develop  direct  contacts  that  eventually  lead  to  the  formation  of  capital  markets. \nAmong  capital  markets,  the  money  market  precedes  all  others,  given  its  central  role  in  transmitting \ninformation  about  interest  rates.  A  government  bond  market  then  tends  to  follow  the  creation  of \nmoney markets, while the corporate bond and equity markets  should only  emerge once government \nbond markets are well-established.  \n \n\nPolicies to develop capital markets should observe this sequencing. Rushing these three stages \ncan lead to instability because risks can rapidly spread from one market to another. It is important that \nsequencing  is  done  right  to  manage  the  risks  of  each  market  once  they  are  established,  before \nembarking  on  the  next  stage.  The  time  horizon  for  completing  all  three  stages  could  range  from  a \ndecade to several decades.  \n\n \nCapital  markets  take  a  long  time  to  develop  because  they  require  a  number  of  prerequisites: \nexchange, clearance, and settlement systems; money market infrastructure; a legal system to enforce \ncontracts;  timely  information  about  financial  soundness  and  future  prospects  of  companies;  and \nadequate  corporate  governance  standards  that  give  investors  the  confidence  that  their  investments \nwill not be stolen (Litan, Pomerleano, and Sundararajan 2003).  \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n8   A  contingent  development  loan  drawdown  option  would  give  authorities  the  option  of  drawing  down  an  international \nfinancial institution loan to finance the deposit insurance scheme, if there were to be an insurance claim on the scheme in \nthe event of sudden withdrawal of deposits from one or more domestic banks. Although international financial institutions \nhave provided contingent loans for other purposes (such as to protect against a surge in international interest rates), there \nhave been no loans thus far to protect against sudden deposit withdrawals. But there is no reason one cannot be designed, \nprovided the international financial institutions are satisfied with the broader finance sector reform program. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\fDeveloping Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   31 \n\n \nMeasures  that  have  long  gestation  periods  therefore  need  to  be  started  early,  such  as \ndeveloping  a  domestic  investor  base,  developing  an  auction  system  and  a  secondary  market  for \ntreasury bonds (including an electronic securities depository), restructuring weak financial institutions, \nand building robust financial infrastructure (including a legal, accounting, and insolvency framework). \nThe  capacity  for  prudential  supervision,  which  helps  prevent  risky  market  practices  and  fraud,  also \nneeds to evolve apace with the finance sector.  \n\n \nPolicies  most  supportive  of  capital  market  development  tend  to  cover  market  infrastructure, \ntransparency,  and  corporate  governance.  The  authorities  should  keep  listing  standards  high  at  all \ntimes\u2014especially when the infrastructure to support financial disclosure is weak and well-trained legal, \naccounting, insolvency, and securities personnel are scarce. All accounts of financial and nonfinancial \ninstitutions  need  to  meet  international  accounting  standards  (which  MFRS  would  do)  and  these \naccounts  should  be  audited  and  made  publicly  available  in  accordance  with  the  law.  Appendix  1  on \ncapital market development provides additional details. \n \nC. \n \n\nPolicies for a More Inclusive Financial System  \n\n1. \n\nBranches  \n \n\nIncreasing the branch network of the banking system is important to increasing access to finance. The \ncurrent distribution of branches across the country understandably favors urban areas, because they \nreach the most customers and reduce the unit costs of banking. But this neglects rural areas. Increasing \nthe size of the branch network is important\u2014but it is not the only answer. Myanmar\u2019s banks are also \nconsidering other, more innovative approaches, such as telebanking and mobile banking.  \n \n\nWhile  the  CBM  has  significantly  eased  the  regulatory  requirements  to  open  new  branches, \nconsiderable room for reform remains. For example, there is no need to ensure ex ante that the ratio of \nthe  capital  base  to  the  number  of  branches  is  kept  constant  (which  requires  banks  to  inject  more \ncapital  each  time  they  open  a  branch).  After  all,  the  CBM  already  has  many  other  prudential \nregulations  to  safeguard  the  risk  profile  of  banks.  Another  unnecessary  requirement  is  the  physical \ninspection  of  a  new  branch  before  approval  is  given.  All  this  does  is  increase  opportunities  for \ncorruption. Since commercial banks must compete on service standards, the CBM needs to recognize \nthat commercial banks\u2014especially private commercial banks\u2014have every incentive to decide where \nbest to locate their branches and ensure appropriate banking standards. The CBM should focus on the \noverall prudential standards for the banks, and occasionally, in their onsite inspections, visit banks to \nconfirm that systems meet CBM standards. \n\n \n2. \n\nState-Owned Development Banking \n\n \nA key challenge facing Myanmar\u2019s policy makers is to increase the access of small firms and farms, and \nindividuals or households, to financial services, especially to credit. The 2003 banking crisis and other \nshocks to the financial system have led to an understandable emphasis on stability and prudence in the \nuse of collateral to underpin all loans. Consequently, however, banks deny loans to those who do not \nown land, even if their investments could generate high rates of return, while giving the lion\u2019s share of \nloans to those who own land and arguably, are in least need of financing. \n \n\nMyanmar\u2019s  President  has  placed  considerable  emphasis  on  extending  loans  to  those  who \ncannot afford collateral\u2014and serious consideration is given to a state-owned credit guarantee agency \nthat will underwrite loans to small enterprises. Such agencies are only one of many kinds of specialized \n\n\u00a0\n\n\f32   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \n\nstate-owned development banks (SDBs). They are established in the belief that investments yielding \nhigh  social  returns  can  sometimes  be  ignored  or  underserviced  by  the  private  sector  because  of \nunattractive private returns or because of undue risk aversion (for example, the Gabon Development \nBank and Banco Nacional de Desarrollo Agr\u00edcola in Honduras). They can specialize in one sector, cut \nacross many sectors, or focus purely on external trade as Export-Import banks. Today, there are nearly \n750  such  SDBs  around  the  world,  with  different  characteristics  and  varying  ownership  patterns\u2014\nprivate,  public,  or  mixed  (UN-DESA  2005).  To  develop  viable  and  sustainable  business  models,  a \ngrowing number of publicly owned SDBs are funding commercial activities while retaining government \nownership and their focus on national development (examples include the Malian Banque Nationale \nde D\u00e9veloppement Agricole and the National Bank for Development in Egypt) (UN-DESA 2005). \n\n \nInternational  experience  suggests  success  only  comes  to  those  SDBs  (including  credit \nguarantee agencies) with clearly defined mandates, high corporate governance standards, strong risk \nmanagement capability, proper regulation and supervision, and a strong management team (de Luna-\nMart\u00ednez  and  Vicente  2012)  (Box  1).  In  fact,  several  SDBs  around  the  world  have  failed  due  to  an \nunviable  business  model,  poor  lending  decisions,  weak  management,  a  large  share  of  nonperforming \nloans,  undue  political  interference,  capture  by  interest  groups,  and  lack  of  well-defined  mandates \n(Gutierrez et al. 2011). In  Indonesia, four development banks that collapsed  because of bad loans in \nthe 1998 Asian financial  crisis\u2014Indonesia Development Bank (Bank Pembangunan Indonesia), Bank \nDagang  Negara  Indonesia,  Bank  Bumi  Daya,  and  Bank  Expor-Impor\u2014are  typical  of  failed \ndevelopment banks.  \n\n \n\nBox 1: State-Owned Development Banks: Lessons of Experience \n\n \nDespite the wave of privatization of state-owned development banks (SDBs) since the 1980s, they still make up 25% on \naverage of the total assets of banking systems around the world. In developing countries, their market share tends to be \nhigher.  \n \n\nGovernments  have  established  SDBs  to  provide  credit  and  other  financial  services  to  individuals,  firms,  and \nstrategic sectors of the economy that private financial institutions were unable or unwilling to serve to the extent desired \nby  policy  makers.  During  the  global  financial  crisis  during  2008\u20132010,  however,  SDBs  acquired  a  new  role\u2014providing \ncountercyclical credit to private borrowers temporarily unable to access loans from private banks or capital markets. \n\n \nAn  SDB  is  a  state-owned  financial  institution  with  the  mandate  to  promote  socioeconomic  development  by \n\nfinancing specified economic activities, sectors, or markets. \n\n \nThe classic justification for SDBs is that they achieve public policy goals by correcting market failures that restrict \ncredit  to  areas  of  the  economy  considered  important  for  development  and  social  welfare.  The  traditional  target  sectors \ntend  to  be  infrastructure,  agriculture,  and  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises.  Other,  less  frequent  target  sectors  have \nbeen  renewable  energy,  climate  change  adaptation  and  mitigation,  education,  low-income  housing,  microenterprises, \ninnovation, and production chains. \n\n \nSDBs  aim  to  correct  \u201cinformation  asymmetries\u201d  that  occur  when  banks  cannot  obtain  accurate  and  verifiable \ninformation about the ability and willingness of borrowers to repay a loan. A common example is small borrowers who may \nnot  have  financial  statements,  let  alone  audited  ones,  and  thus  lack  adequate  information  to  demonstrate  their \ncreditworthiness.  Another  market  failure  could  be  the  absence  of  systems  guaranteeing  compliance  with  financial \ncontracts\u2014most tend to be slow, costly, or inefficient\u2014especially because the costs of contract compliance are higher for \nsmall  borrowers  than  for  large  firms.  Externalities  associated  with  lending  to  a  particular  sector  for  which  private  banks \noften overestimate the risk, or underestimate the benefits, or both, are a third market failure.  \n\ncontinued on next page \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\fDeveloping Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   33 \n\nBox 1   continued \n\nMarket failures are best resolved through regulatory reforms that improve market information, increase creditor \nrights,  ensure  contract  compliance,  promote  innovation,  and  expand  collateral  options.  Governments  should  consider \nSDBs a temporary solution to increase access and serve a neglected sector while broader finance sector reforms mature. \nThey must therefore complement, not substitute, for systemic financial reforms. Without the latter, SDBs could crowd out \nprivate  banks,  incur  financial  losses,  and  drain  the  budget,  or  have  little  development  impact.  To  combat  pressure  from \npolitical  interests  to  maintain  SDBs  even  after  they  cease  to  be  useful,  the  government  could  create  sunset  clauses \nstipulating by law when an SDB should close or make it costly to extend its existence. \n\n \nSDBs  do  not  have  to  provide  financing  directly\u2014they  can  instead  guarantee  private  lending  to  target  sectors. \nState-owned  credit  guarantee  agencies  are  common  in  several  countries.  Such  agencies  have  several  advantages.  First, \nthey encourage competition among private banks, which will help ensure the most efficient lending outcomes. Second, the \ncredit guarantee reduces the burden on the borrower to offer collateral. Third, the government can serve several target \nsectors  through  one  institution  and  can  therefore  concentrate  scarce  expertise  and  ensure  sound  risk  management. \nFinally,  as  conditions  change  and  new  priorities  emerge,  credit  guarantee  agencies  can  alter  the  guarantee  choices  they \noffer private banks without incurring significant adjustment costs. \n\n \nMost  SDBs  are  capitalized  through  tax  revenues,  although  low-cost  foreign  loans  and  aid  (such  as  from  the \nWorld  Bank  or  the  Asian  Development  Bank)  can  also  be  used.  Budgetary  sources  of  finance  increase  the  financial \nautonomy of SDBs, avoid competition with other regular sources of bank funding (such as deposits and bonds), and allow \nSDBs  to  provide  long-term  finance  for  development  projects  at  below  market  rates.  Indeed,  SDBs  able  to  separate \nsubsidies  from  their  financing  sources  can  function  more  as  development  agencies  than  as  financial  intermediaries.  For \nexample,  if  government  financial  support  is  in  the  form  of  an  initial  endowment,  then  SDBs  will  have  an  incentive  to \nprovide  their  services  in  a  financially  sustainable  manner.  In  addition,  limiting  the  ability  of  SDBs  to  assume  financial \nliabilities, including by taking deposits, may limit future fiscal costs for the government. \n\n \nMany  SDB  failures  in  the  developing  world  have  been  caused  by  weak  risk  assessment  capabilities,  poor \nmanagement,  inadequate  monitoring  capacity,  poor  lending  decisions,  high  nonperforming  loans,  undue  political \ninterference, capture by interest groups, lack of well-defined mandates, widespread corruption, and negative real interest \nrates leading to open-ended state subsidies.  \n\n \nIn  contrast,  international  experience  shows  that  successful  SDBs  usually  have  clearly  defined  mandates,  high \ncorporate  governance  standards,  strong  risk  management  capability,  proper  regulation  and  supervision,  a  strong \nmanagement team, and financial and legal arrangements that minimize budgetary support.  \n\n \nInternational  experience  also  shows  that  good-practice  policies  applied  to  SDBs  tend  to  increase  their \nprobability of success. For example, government should legally oblige the SDB to achieve a minimum return on capital. It \nshould  transfer  SDB  management  to  the  private  sector  and  protect  it  from  political  influence  by  guaranteeing \nindependence. Governing boards should be composed entirely of independent, professionally qualified members.  \n\n \nThe  governing  board  could  establish \n\nincentives  supportive  of  good  development  outcomes  through \nperformance  contracts  and  key  performance  indicators.  It  should  insist  that  management  use  sunset  clauses  when \nlaunching  a  new  program.  Laws  should  explicitly  prevent  government  bailout  of  a  failed  SDB.  Management  should \nencourage the private sector to share the risk of lending to underserved markets.  And it should use promarket instruments \nwhen supporting SDBs.  \n \n\nIn  addition,  government  should  introduce  a  legal  obligation  to  achieve  a  minimum  return  on  capital,  place  the \ndevelopment  bank  in  the  private  sector  under  a  management  contract,  and  place  independent  and  qualified  finance \nprofessionals on the board of directors (de la Torre, Gozzi, and Schmukler 2007). \n\n \nSDBs in Myanmar can help broaden access to finance and be a vehicle for countercyclical monetary policy. But \nauthorities need to carefully craft the legal, institutional, and incentive frameworks to increase probability of success and \nminimize  the  burden  on  the  exchequer.  The  government  must  also  create  organizational  capabilities  to  manage  these \ninstitutions professionally and without political interference, and implement promarket programs that supplement private \nsector initiatives, not substitute for them. \n \nSource: Author. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n\f34   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \n\nThe biggest challenge development banks tend to face is the ability to manage risks. This reflects \nthe  difficulties  they  face  throughout  the  lending  cycle,  which  includes  the  assessment  of  prospective \nclients\u2019 creditworthiness, the absence of accounting standards, the way they assess risks, and their ability \nto  enforce  contracts  and  collect  on  loans  or  execute  collateral.  Other  big  challenges  they  face  are \nfinancial self-reliance (over 60% of development banks surveyed globally recently reported reliance on \nannual budgetary subsidies), the flexibility to acquire appropriate skills and professional managers, and \npolitical interference in decision making (de Luna-Mart\u00ednez and Vicente 2012). \n\nThat  is  not  to  say  that  development  banks  cannot  be  successful.  In  fact,  several  in  other \ncountries  have  made  a  development  impact  and  remained  financially  sound.  These  experiences \nsuggest innovative ways for SDBs to improve their chances of success.9 \n\n \n\n \n\nBox 2: Financing Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises  \n\n \nCountries have two sets of choices to make in financing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The first is whether \ngovernment should set up a state-owned development bank (SDB) specialized in SME financing or require all SDBs to \ninclude SME financing as part of operations.  \n \n\nThe second has three options: support direct lending through SDBs, provide credit guarantees, or provide equity. \n\nIn each case, low interest loans are provided to SMEs through credit or equity lines, and SDBs then refinance themselves \neither through the budgetary mechanism, through central bank credit lines, or through credit lines financed by bilateral or \nmultilateral financial institutions. \n\n \nSDBs can provide SMEs working capital loans, loans denominated in local or foreign currency, as well as equity \nfinancing or even venture capital funds. Whatever the type of financing, SDBs need to acquire specialized knowledge of \nSMEs and the sector into which they are lending, in part to keep the cost of lending within reasonable bounds (since fixed \ncosts of information are high and loan amounts tend to be small) and to keep the nonperforming loan ratio within required \nprudential limits. \n\n \nThere is no consensus on the advantages or disadvantages of credit guarantees versus direct lending. Both tend \n\nto suffer from the same challenges of high fixed information costs, large losses from nonperforming assets, and \nmismanagement of programs and institutions (UNCTAD 2001). A useful mechanism to consider for exporting SMEs is for \nSDBs to guarantee letters of credit based on confirmed export orders and buyer letters of credit. But developing such a \nsystem requires considerable knowledge, expertise, and links with foreign banks in the major export markets. All this \nsuggests that Myanmar focus initially on pooling expertise and systems in one SDB, make it a center of excellence, and \nthen after a few years review the experience to decide on next steps. \n\n \nExperience from other countries, such as the Industrial Development Bank of India or Malaysia\u2019s Industrial \nDevelopment Finance Berhad, also suggests that SME finance needs to be accompanied with technical assistance for \nproject development and project design to ensure the finance is productive and efficient.  \nSource: Author. \n\n \nThe government needs to link its decision to establish a development bank with its program to \nrestructure  state  banks.  Those  state  banks  that  will  continue  will  need  to  be  transformed  into \ndevelopment banks\u2014leaving all commercial banking to the private sector. If the government decides \non a development bank arrangement, such as the Credit Guarantee Scheme for SME lending discussed \nin Box 2, it should do  so  in partnership with organizations  such  as the IFC  or ADB, and build on the \nexperience of other Asian countries (such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n9   For more insight, see Gutierrez et al. 2011 and Cih\u00e1k, M. and A. Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt 2013.  \n\n\u00a0\n\n\fDeveloping Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   35 \n\n3. \n\nMicrofinance \n\n \nAccording to one estimate, demand for microfinance in Myanmar is four times greater than supply,10 \nwhich  means  that  fewer  than  20  out  of  100  potential  microfinance  clients  have  access  to  formal \nfinancial  services,  with  most  people  relying  on  family  savings  or  costly  alternatives  such  as  informal \nmoneylenders (Duflos et al. 2013).  \n\n \nIt  is  therefore  not  surprising  that  the  government  has  placed  high  priority  on  delivering \nmicrofinance,  for  which  it  enacted  a  new  Microfinance  Law  in  November  2011  (together  with \nNotification 277 and accompanying instructions). The agency designated to license new microfinance \ninstitutions\u2014the  Myanmar  Microfinance  Supervisory  Enterprise\u2014has  already \nlicensed  142 \nmicrofinance  providers,  of  which  3  are  foreign  and  50  have  been  given  a  license  to  collect  deposits \n(which effectively makes them banks).  \n\n \nThe capital requirements for deposit-taking microfinance institutions, at $30,000, is very low \nand,  if  improperly  managed  and  supervised,  could  cause  insolvencies  among  microfinance  agencies. \nMoreover,  these  new  microfinance  providers  are  already  entering  a  crowded  market.  State  banks, \ncooperatives,  international  and  national  nongovernment  organizations,  international  organizations, \nspecialized agricultural development companies, informal lenders, semiformal village revolving funds, \nand  community  funds  are  already  in  the  business  of  providing  microfinance  (Appendix  2).  These \nagencies already reach some 2.8 million borrowers. The government may therefore want to pause in \nissuing  licenses,  study  the  microfinance  sector  more  carefully,  review  the  current  institutional \narrangements for licensing and supervision, and rethink its strategy to provide a sustainable system of \nmicrofinance. \n \n\n4. \n\nBranchless Banking \n\n \nWhile  increased  branch  banking  will  extend  access  to  finance,  recent  innovations  in  branchless \nbanking can allow Myanmar to leapfrog other countries and provide its people access to finance more \nrapidly  and  cost-effectively.  Branchless  banking  includes  a  range  of  options  that  are  not  mutually \nexclusive, including the following:  \n \n\ni.  ATMs (or bank branches in a box); banking vans (or bank branches on wheels).  \nii. \n\nIn-store  point-of-sale  systems  (that  permit  cashless  payments  using  credit,  debit,  or  prepaid \ncards).  \n\niii.  Internet banking (permitting virtual connections with banks and their branches).  \niv.  Banking agents (outsourced bank branches).  \nv.  Mobile (telephone) banking (a bank branch in a pocket).  \n\n \nEach of these channels has proven itself in the marketplace and countries use them to varying \ndegrees (IFC 2012). In some cases, they have induced channel substitution, whether because of greater \nconvenience or lower cost to the user, and have shifted transactions that would otherwise have gone \nthrough a bank branch.  \n \n\nAnalysis  of  branchless  banking  gives  clear  evidence  of  its  many  benefits\u2014and  many  of \nMyanmar\u2019s  private  banks  are  gearing  up  to  introduce  various  combinations  of  branchless  banking \nchannels. Although still in its infancy, the Myanmar Payment Union, with 17 private banks as members, \nis already providing a platform for spreading an ATM network. Some banks have partnered with credit \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n10   \u201cMicrofinance\u201d applies to financial services provided to low-income individuals, households, farms, and firms.  \n\n\u00a0\n\n\f36   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 430 \n\ncompanies to introduce credit card services, and the point-of-sale (POS) network, albeit still small, is \nset  to  grow  rapidly.  Now  that  Myanmar\u2019s  telecom  sector  has  issued  two  licenses  for  mobile \ntelephony\u2014to  Norway\u2019s  Telenor  and  Qatar\u2019s  Ooredoo  (formerly  Qtel)\u2014and  with  mobile  phone \nconnections poised to expand rapidly, banks will be able to explore other branchless banking avenues, \nincluding telebanking, banking agents, and POS systems. \n\nWhat  is  the  role  of  government\u2014and  regulation\u2014in  supporting  the  growth  of  branchless \nbanking and ensuring that its expansion does not threaten the stability of the banking system? As the \nrapid expansion of Kenya\u2019s M-Pesa11 system has shown, expanding access need not result in financial \ninstability \nif  appropriate  regulatory  and  supervisory  safeguards  are  combined  with  market \nliberalization policies.  \n\n \nIn particular, authorities should continue to emphasize know-your-customer requirements for \nfinancial  institutions  to  ensure  Myanmar  complies  with  international  standards  for  antimoney \nlaundering and combating the financing of terrorism initiatives. \n\n \n\n \n\nKenya\u2019s experience has also shown that when developing the policy framework for branchless \nbanking,  all  the  relevant  departments  of  government  (central  bank  and  the  ministries  of    finance, \ncommunications,  planning  and  economic  development)  must  ensure  close  dialogue  with  the \nprivate sector. \n \n \n\nVIII. \n\nSEQUENCING REFORMS FOR FINANCE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT \n\n \nPolicy makers cannot implement all the actions described in the previous section at once. Indeed, and \nas  noted,  Myanmar\u2019s  capacity  constraints  in  all  spheres,  including  in  the  finance  sector,  make  it \nimperative  that  authorities  sequence  reforms  carefully.  The  country  cannot  afford  to  implement \nreforms in the wrong order, which will simply waste effort. There may be considerable pressure from \ndifferent  quarters\u2014not  least  from  influential  bankers  themselves,  or  from  the  international  donor \ncommunity\u2014to rush the reform process. But policy makers will need to focus on the national interest \nand  on  what  makes  most  sense  in  Myanmar\u2019s  particular  circumstances.  For  example,  as  indicated \nearlier, it would make little sense to open the finance sector prematurely to 100% foreign-owned banks \nwithout  first  having  a  strong  regulatory  structure  and  building  competitive  and  financially  sound \ndomestic  banks.  Similarly,  premature  interest  rate  liberalization  without  well-functioning  supervision \nand  well-established  and  well-understood  prudential  norms  would  only  lead  to  excessive  risk  taking \nand lead eventually to financial crisis. \n \n\nTo  develop  a  stable  and  efficient  finance  sector  that  can  support  long-term  development \nneeds, Myanmar should focus first on establishing strong foundations. Namely, it should put in place a \nlegal  and  institutional  structure  that  provides  financial  institutions  with  regulatory  clarity  and  central \nbank services that facilitate efficient real-time clearance and settlement of interbank claims and permit \nsound liquidity management. Many of these initial capacity-building initiatives are eminently feasible \nand  the  authorities  can  implement  them  with  the  help  of  the  international  community,  notably  the \ninternational  financial  institutions  (the  IMF,  World  Bank,  and  ADB)  and  key  bilateral  aid  agencies, \nespecially  JICA,  the  Department  for  International  Development,  and  Australia\u2019s  Department  of \nForeign Affairs and Trade. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n11   M-Pesa is Kenya's mobile payment system. Kenyans use mobile phones for payment and banking transactions. Half of all \nmobile  money  transactions  in  the  world  take  place  in  Kenya,  where  annual  transfers  have  reached  $10  billion  (Gilpin \n2014). \n\n\u00a0\n\n\fDeveloping Myanmar\u2019s Finance Sector to Support Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustainable Economic Growth   |   37 \n\n \nTo this end, the government should focus on the following reforms in the short-term, namely \n\nover the next 12 months or so: \n \n\ni.

These reforms could include the following actions: \n\n \ni.  Enforce  the  MFRS  for  banks  (which  should  be  the  responsibility  of  the  central  bank)  and \ncorporates (which should be the responsibility of the Directorate for Investment and Company \nAdministration in the Ministry of Planning and National Development). \n\nii.  Fully implement the interbank electronic clearance, payments, and settlement system. \niii.  Introduce an auction system and a secondary market for treasury bonds. \niv.  Introduce an interbank market to permit better liquidity management. \nv.  Develop a market-based government bond market and develop benchmark interest rates. \nvi.  Launch an intensified CBM supervision capacity building program with international expertise. \nvii.  Study the introduction of a deposit insurance arrangement. \nviii. Re-launch a reformed microfinance strategy. \nix.  Introduce regulations for branchless banking. \nx.

Work with the World Bank and ADB to prepare a state bank restructuring strategy, based on \nthe audit results of the four state banks. Allow one or, at most, two state development banks to \nindependent  and \nsurvive.  Give  them  clear  mandates,  adequate  financial  resources, \nprofessional  management,  a  corporate  governance  framework  that  protects  them  against \npolitical  interference,  and  an  incentive  structure  that  encourages  achievement  of  their \nmandate but combines it with prudent financial management. \n\n \nIntersection of Finance Sector Reforms with Other Reforms \n \nFinance sector reforms will be taking place alongside reforms in other sectors, and it is important that \nthey are well-coordinated. Thus, reforms to monetary and fiscal policies will have a bearing on the pace \nand sequencing of finance sector reforms. Similarly, policy makers should undertake reforms in the real \nsector  (such  as  trade,  agriculture,  land,  manufacturing,  and  investment  licensing  reforms)  in \ncoordination  with  finance  sector  reforms.  Ideally,  real  sector  reforms  should  precede  finance  sector \nreforms  so  that  any  changes  in  relative  prices  do  not  weaken  the  portfolio  of  banks.  In  Myanmar\u2019s \ncurrent  situation,  however,  pragmatism  demands  that  government  should  move  ahead  with  finance \nsector reforms even as it is implementing real sector reforms. \n\n \n\nFiscal  reforms  will  be  critical  for  the  smooth  development  of  the  finance  sector  for  several \nreasons. First, better fiscal performance places less pressure on the banking system to perform quasi-\nfiscal  functions.  It  is  better  that  government  agencies  implement  development  programs  with  high \nsocial  but  low  financial  rates  of  return,  and  good  fiscal  performance  ensures  they  can  be  financed \nthrough the budgetary system.  \n\n \nSecond, good fiscal performance allows targeted lending programs through the banking system \nto use budget-financed interest rate incentives rather than administratively suppressed interest rates, \nwhich impose a tax on depositors.  \n\n \nThird, smaller fiscal deficits reduce the likelihood of \u201ccrowding out\u201d the private sector, as more \nfinancial resources can be channeled through the banking system to private businesses rather than to \nthe  government.  This  helps  the  government  avoid  forced  placement  of  government  debt  in  banks \n(which taxes the banking system rather than encourages it).  \n \n\nFourth,  greater  availability  of  fiscal  resources  will  give  the  government  more  options  when  it \ncomes  to  restructuring  state  bank  balance  sheets  and,  if  some  need  to  be  closed,  assisting  with \nmeeting their outstanding net liabilities.  \n\n \nFinally,  sound  fiscal  management  can  prove  helpful  in  times  of  financial  crisis  when  the \n\ngovernment may need to recapitalize a bank for strategic purposes and systemic stability. \n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\fAPPENDIX 1: CAPITAL MARKET DEVELOPMENT \n\nMoney Market  \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  money  market  forms  the  base  of  the  capital  market  by  supporting  trading  in  the  most  liquid \ninstruments, including overnight loan facilities. To build a money market in Myanmar, the central bank \nneeds to introduce monetary instruments (such as treasury bills, central bank bills, and central banks \nauctions) that help banks (and eventually nonbank financial institutions) manage their liquidity. They \nshould also apply reserve requirements as an initial means to control liquidity, and design a framework \nby which banks can access the central bank\u2019s standing liquidity facilities. The money market develops \nas the central bank buys and sells short-term funds, adjusts the appropriate level of required reserves \nin  line  with  macroeconomic  needs,  and  alleviates  systemic  liquidity  shortages  when  they  arise.  The \nprimary  objective,  however,  should  be  to  encourage  banks  to  trade  money  and  other  liquid  financial \ninstruments among themselves, and only when these prove inadequate should banks resort to trading \nwith the central bank.  \n \n\nRepurchase agreements (or repos) are a key instrument in money markets and an important \nmethod  by  which  the  central  bank  can  exert  indirect  monetary  control  and  influence  liquidity  in  the \nfinancial  system.12  Repos  become  particularly  important  when  counterparty  credit  risks  are  high  (as \nthey  are  in  Myanmar),  because  they  are  a  form  of  collateralized  lending.  The  repo  market,  however, \nrequires an underlying legal structure. Participants should meet key prudential financial criteria\u2014such \nas  minimum  capital  requirements  and  the  ability  to  meet  mandated  liquidity  ratios\u2014and  should  be \nsubject to central bank oversight.  \n\n \nGovernment Bond Market Development \n\nB. \n \nThe  government  bond  market  is  the  next  stage  of  capital  market  development,  and  its  formation \nnormally follows the creation and development of  the money  market. The  government  bond market \nprovides  a  market-determined  term  structure  of  interest  rates  that  reflects  the  opportunity  cost  of \nmoney at different maturities. The development of a term structure of interest rates in relatively risk-\nfree government bonds helps the introduction and development of new financial products of different \nmaturities that can assist lenders and borrowers manage risk better and provide benchmark discount \nrates that assist market participants undertake project cost\u2013benefit analysis and calculate one measure \nof the market value of companies. A government bond market also facilitates the conduct of monetary \npolicy  by  aiding  with  the  transmission  mechanism  for  interest  rates  and,  together  with  the  money \nmarket, gives financial institutions more instruments with which to manage liquidity.  \nThe  development  of  a  government  bond  market  usually  precedes  the  formation  of  corporate  equity \nand  bond  markets.  The  following  are  prerequisites,  however,  for  government  bond  markets  to  fulfill \ntheir required role: \n \n\ni.  Macroeconomic stability; \nii.  An efficient and liquid money market; \niii.  A clear articulation and announcement of the government\u2019s debt strategy; \niv.  A credible and regular supply of government debt securities to the market; \nv.  The presence of many potential investors; \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n12   Repurchase  agreements  are  the  sale  of securities combined  with  an  agreement  for  the  seller  to  buy  back  the  securities \n\nlater at a higher price, with the difference in the sale and the repurchase price acting as an implicit interest rate. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\f40   |   Appendix 1: Capital Market Development \n\nvi.  A  neutral  policy  toward  capital  taxation  that  makes  no  distinction  between  incomes  from \ndifferent types of financial investments (bank deposits, government bonds, corporate equity, \nand other financial instruments); \n\nvii.  A settlement infrastructure and regulatory framework that facilitates secondary trading; and  \nviii. An effective and transparent legal framework that provides the legal underpinning to financial \n\ncontracts implicit in primary and secondary market trading.  \n\n \n\nTo establish a government bond market, the government must be committed to financing its \nborrowing requirement at market-based prices, permanently move away from forced placement, and \nensure  standardized  government  securities  (apart  from  maturity)  with  a  concentration  in  a  limited \nnumber  of  popular  benchmark  maturities.  Key  government  measures  would  involve  establishing  a \nprimary  dealer  system,  fostering  repurchase  (repo)  transactions,  and  building  benchmark  security \nissues.  \n\n \nThe infrastructure for spot primary and secondary trading should be simple, safe, and secure\u2014\nand be able to handle volumes consistent with market needs. Because Myanmar\u2019s infrastructure is still \nweak, primary traders should be required to meet a minimum bidding commitment for primary trades \nand publicly offer two-way quotes for secondary trades, while building distribution channels, acting as \nintermediaries, and providing market information such as prices, volumes, and spreads. In return, they \nshould  be  granted  certain  privileges  for  their  market-making  role\u2014including  exclusive  or  restricted \naccess to auctions, access to noncompetitive bidding, and liquidity support from the central bank. At \nthe same time, the authorities should take care that primary dealers do not collude to distort the price \nof securities for their benefit. \n\nCorporate and Equity Market Development \n\n \nThe  usual  sequence  is  to  start  with  short-term  bonds  with  maturities  similar  or  close  to \ninstruments available in the money market; but the transition to longer-term fixed rate debt must be \ngradual. It is important that bond markets are liquid at all times, which means active participation by \nintermediaries that have adequate capitalization and adopt appropriate risk management strategies, as \nwell as an efficient market infrastructure, including well-designed securities settlement arrangements. \n \nC. \n \nCorporate  bond  and  equity  market  development  should  be  the  last  phase  of  capital  market \ndevelopment and should be undertaken only when the money market and government bond markets \nare functioning smoothly. Corporate bond markets would use the same infrastructure as government \nbonds, but equity markets will have different market infrastructure needs. Both markets help diversify \nsources  of  corporate  finance  away  from  banks  and  permit  the  availability  of  longer  maturity  funds, \nwhich banks typically do not provide.  \n \n\nIt  is  important  that  corporate  bond  and  corporate  equity  market  development  is  balanced. \nCorporate  bond  markets  without  equity  markets  could  cause  excessive  leverage;  equity  markets \nwithout bond markets would not flourish as finance would be too expensive. Both require accurate and \ntimely disclosure of financial information from the issuer to make informed investment decisions and \nassess  creditworthiness.  The  legal  and  institutional  infrastructure  should  protect  investors  against \nfraud and misrepresentation. \n\n \nIn  small  economies  like  Myanmar,  it  is  difficult  to  find  enough  large  companies  that  can  be \nlisted  on  the  stock  exchange.  Those  that  list  will  not  only  cede  some  management  control,  but  also \nexperience additional costs for accounting, legal, and reporting requirements and have less flexibility in \n\n\u00a0\n\n\fAppendix 1: Capital Market Development   |   41 \n\ndecision making. It is more probable that, as private companies grow larger, they will gradually list on \nthe stock exchange, initially with a small number and then later with a broader base of shareholders. \n\n \nWhen the number of total shares in the stock exchange is small, it makes considerable sense to \nhave periodic markets instead of continuous markets as a means of bringing together all trades at one \ntime, thereby deepening the market for a short period and enhancing the market\u2019s liquidity. \n\n \nEquity  instruments  are  private  property  instruments,  which  require  mechanisms  to  enforce \nlegal  ownership  rights  and  facilitate  ownership  transfer.  Court  systems  need  to  be  sufficiently \nsophisticated in dealing with complex commercial claims and be able to resolve disputes quickly and \nfairly.  The  court  system,  corporate  governance  structures,  and  the  quality  of  financial  disclosure \nstatements together should protect minority shareholders against related party transactions. \n\n \nEquity  markets  have  traditionally  developed  through  stock  exchange  mechanisms  that  bring \ntogether  investors  temporally  and  increase  the  liquidity  of  financial  instruments.  Settlement  systems \nneed to be safe and efficient\u2014and Myanmar needs to consider carefully the 2001 recommendations \nof  the  Basel  Committee  on  Payment  and  Settlement  Systems  (CPSS)  and  the  International \nOrganization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) that set the international standard for clearing and \nsettlement systems (BIS and IOSCO 2001). \n \n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\fCategory \n\nInstitutions \n\nNumber of \nBranches/Outlets \n\nAPPENDIX 2: MICROFINANCE PROVIDERS IN MYANMAR \n \nAverage Loan \nOutstanding \n(kyat) \n\nOutstanding Loan \nPortfolio \n(kyat) \n\nNumber of \nDeposit \nAccounts \n\nTotal Savings \n(kyat) \n\nNumber of \nBorrowers \n\nAverage Deposit \nSize \n(kyat) \n\nRegulated \n\n205 \n\n1,420,000 \n\n84,000,000,000 \n\n59,155 \n\n1,720,000 \n\n86,891,840,000 \n\n50,519 \n\nState-owned \nbank \n\nPrivate bank \n\nMLFDBb \n\nPACT-UNDPc \n\nMADBa \n\nMSLEb \n\nPACTc \n\nGRETd \n\nNongovernment \norganization \n\nSave the Childrene \n\nWorld Visionf \n\nProximity Designg \n\nAMDAh \nTotalh \nCentral \nCooperative \nSocietyi \nFinancial \nCooperatives - \nUnion of Savings \nand \nCredit Federationi \nRice specialization \ncompaniesj \nOther agricultural \nspecialized \ncompaniesj \n \n\nCooperatives \n\nSpecialized \nAgricultural \nCompanies \n\nWomen's unionk \n\n143 \n\n53 \n\n105 \n\n16 \n\n4 \n\n... \n\n12 \n\n8 \n\n... \n... \n\n38 \n\n22 \n\n16 \n\n \n\n208,778 \n\n31,341,790,000 \n\n150,120 \n\n... \n\n... \n\n... \n\n57,128 \n\n4,234,502,910 \n\n74,123 \n\n365,410\n\n52,701,000,000\n\n144,224\n\n420,133 \n\n10,930,000,000\n\n30,000\n\n6,155 \n\n840,041,000 \n\n136,481 \n\nNondeposit taking microfinance institution \n\n7,737 \n\n367,747,782 \n\n47,531 \n\n7,737 \n\n25,975,513 \n\n3,357 \n\n... \n\n... \n\n... \n\n... \n\n... \n\n...\n...\n\n... \n\n... \n\n...\n\n... \n\n... \n\n... \n\n... \n\n... \n\n...\n...\n\n... \n\n... \n\n...\n\n13,282 \n\n1,910,033,328 \n\n143,806 \n\n16,000 \n\n3,113,831,000 \n\n194,614 \n\n1,510\n1,197\n\n55,109,960\n165,077,000\n\n36,497\n137,909\n\n57,502 \n\n20,092,708,226 \n\n349,426 \n\n140,000 \n\n20,000,000,000 \n\n142,857 \n\n4,800\n\n48,000,000\n\n10,000\n\n46 \n\n32,851 \n\n1,125,690,000 \n\n34,267 \n\n32,851 \n\n340,340,000 \n\n10,360 \n\n1,625 \n\n476,632 \n\n16,500,000,000 \n\n34,618 \n\n476,632 \n\n24,200,000,000 \n\n50,773 \n\nYes \n\nSupervisory \nAgency \n\nMinistry of \nFinance \nand Revenue \nMinistry of \nFinance \nand Revenue \nCentral Bank of \nMyanmar \n...\nMicrofinance\nSupervisory \nEnterprise \nMicrofinance\nSupervisory \nEnterprise \nMicrofinance\nSupervisory \nEnterprise \nMicrofinance\nSupervisory \nEnterprise \nMicrofinance\nSupervisory \nEnterprise \n...\n...\nMSE / Central\nCooperative \nSociety \n\nCentral \nCooperative \nSociety \n\n... \n\n... \n\n...\n\ncontinued on next page \n\nYes \n\nYes \n\nYes \n\nNo\n\nYes \n\nYes \n\nYes \n\nYes \n\nYes \n\nNo\nNo\n\nYes \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nNo\n\n... \n\n... \n\n... \n\n... \n\n... \n\n...\n...\n\n... \n\n... \n\n...\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\fAppendix 2: Microfinance Providers in Myanmar   |   43 \n\nAppendix 2   continued \n\nCategory \nUnion solidarity \nDevelopment \nAssociationl \nCommunity- \nbased \norganizationsl \nTOTAL \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nInstitutions \n\nNumber of \nBranches/Outlets \n\nNumber of \nBorrowers \n\nOutstanding Loan \n\nPortfolio \n(kyat) \n\nAverage Loan \nOutstanding \n\n(kyat) \n\nNumber of \nDeposit \nAccounts \n\nTotal Savings \n\nAverage \nDeposit Size \n\n(kyat) \n\n(kyat) \n\nRegulated \n\nSupervisory \nAgency \n\n... \n\n... \n\n... \n\n... \n\n... \n\n... \n\n... \n\n... \n\n... \n\n... \n\n... \n\n... \n\n... \n\n... \n\n... \n\nNo \n\n... \n\n... \n\n2,293 \n\n2,808,982\n\n236,495,531,206\n\n119,763\n\n2,657,353 \n\n122,388,155,513\n\n\u2026 = not available, AMDA = Association of Medical Doctors of Asia, GRET = an international nongovernment organization governed by French laws, MADB = Myanma Agricultural Development Bank, MLFDB = Myanma \nLivestock and Fisheries Development Bank, MSLE = Myanma Small Loans Enterprise, PACT = Partner Agencies Collaborating Together, UNDP = United Nations Development Programme.   \nNotes: Because overall data availability and accuracy is low, users should view the above figures with caution. \na Data as of March 2012 provided by MADB. \nb Data as of March 2011 from CBM. \nc Data as of September 2012 from UNDP for PACT UNDP and as of end October 2012 from PACT for PACT. \nd Data as of October 2012 from GRET. \ne Data as of October from Save the Children.

Its mission is to help its developing member \ncountries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, \nit remains home to the majority of the world\u2019s poor.
