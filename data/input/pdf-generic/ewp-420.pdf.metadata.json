INTRODUCTION \n \nThis paper asks two complementary questions. First, whether today\u2019s developing economies can \nachieve high-income status without first building large manufacturing sectors; and second, whether it \nis becoming more difficult to sustain high levels of manufacturing activity. These are relevant questions \nbecause a long tradition in development economics holds that manufacturing is the engine of growth \n(Kaldor 1966; Chenery, Robinson, and Syrquin 1986). However, as we discuss below, there is a growing \nperception that economies are finding it more difficult to sustain high levels of manufacturing output \nand employment while simultaneously increasing wages. \n \nThe relevance of manufacturing for economic growth derives from the fact that faster growth \nin  manufacturing  generates  faster  growth  in  productivity  in  other  sectors  of  the  economy. \nManufacturing draws resources from traditional sectors of the economy, often without significantly \nreducing output in these sectors. Channeling these resources into manufacturing is beneficial because \nmanufactured goods have high income elasticities of demand, and because many manufacturing \nactivities  are  produced  under  economies  of  scale.  Moreover,  manufacturing  has  a  potential  for \nproductivity catch-up that is unmatched by most services.1 Along these lines, recent research confirms \nthat manufacturing is key for economic development. Rodrik (2013a) shows that manufacturing \nexhibits unconditional convergence in labor productivity\u2014industries that start farther away from the \nlabor  productivity  frontier  experience  significantly  faster  productivity  growth  even  without \nconditioning on variables, such as domestic policies, human capital, geography, or institutional quality. \nEconomies with higher manufacturing employment shares should therefore grow faster. See also \nAmable (2000), Fagerberg (2000), Peneder (2003), Rodrik (2009), Szirmai (2012), Szirmai and \nVerspagen (2011), and UNIDO (2013).  \n \nFor  these  reasons,  many  national  governments  have  targeted  manufacturing  in  their \ndevelopment plans. For example, India\u2019s 2011 National Manufacturing Policy aims at raising the share \nof manufacturing in gross domestic product (GDP) to 25% and calls for setting up manufacturing \nzones to create 100 million manufacturing jobs. The Philippines is also developing a comprehensive \nmanufacturing  road  map,  and  Indonesia  passed  a  new  Industry  Law  in  early  2014.  Developed \neconomies like the United States (US), Australia or the members of the European Union, are also \ninterested in industrializing, or rather, in reindustrializing after decades of deindustrializing (Helper, \nKrueger, and Wial 2012; Felipe, forthcoming 2015). \n \nAs noted above, however, there is a growing perception that, in recent times, it has become \nmore difficult for economies to sustain high levels of manufacturing output and employment while \nsimultaneously increasing wages and living standards (Rodrik 2009). This difficulty has been attributed \nto at least two forces. First, the internationalization of supply chains and increased international \ncompetition are making the location of manufacturing activity more sensitive to wage improvements, \nother things equal (Hasan, Mitra, and Ramaswamy 2007; Rodrik 1997). This phenomenon tends to \nreduce manufacturing output and employment levels more in high-wage, high-income economies, \nthan in their poorer counterparts. To the extent that manufacturing output and employment shares \ntend to increase with income per capita when incomes are low, and then to decrease with incomes, \nfollowing  an  inverted  U-shape,  this  force  should  cause  the  per  capita  income  level  at  which \nmanufacturing employment and output shares peak to decline. However, to the extent that economies \nthat experience rising wages can substitute capital for labor, this shift should be more apparent in \nemployment than in output shares. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n1   See the Symposium on Kaldor\u2019s Growth Laws, published in the Journal of Post Keynesian Economics (1983). ", "2   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 420 \n \nSecond, it has long been accepted that technological change has placed downward pressure \non the sector\u2019s demand for less-skilled workers (Berman, Bound, and Griliches 1994; Berman, Bound, \nand Machin 1998; Goldin and Katz 2009), and there is now growing concern that technological change \nand the efficiencies that derive from globalized mass production are generally labor displacing (Cowen \n2013;  Brynjolfsson  and  McAffee  2014).  Faster  rates  of  labor-displacing  technological  change  in \nmanufacturing than in other sectors should push manufacturing employment shares down relative to \nmanufacturing  output  shares.  Rodrik  (2013b,  p.  52)  has  echoed  this  sentiment,  \u201cTechnological \nchanges  are  rendering  manufacturing  more  capital  and  skill  intensive,  reducing  the  employment \nelasticity of industrialization and the capacity of manufacturing to absorb large volumes of unskilled \nlabor from the countryside and from the informal sector.\u201d Together, these hypothesized forces make \nus wonder whether the rapid manufacturing-driven growth experienced by the Republic of Korea, \nSingapore, or Taipei,China, remains possible elsewhere. If it has become less likely, is there any \nevidence of an alternative path to prosperity? \n \nThis paper, therefore, answers two sets of questions. First, are there relevant examples of \neconomies that are rich today but did not attain large manufacturing sectors at some point in their \npast? Are there economies that did not achieve large manufacturing sectors and became rich anyway? \nAnd  has  manufacturing  employment  or  manufacturing  output  been  more  relevant  to  eventual \nprosperity? Second, is it indeed the case that high manufacturing employment and output shares are \nbecoming more difficult to sustain? Specifically, if, as hypothesized, economies are experiencing a \ncombination  of  increasing  international  competition  for  manufacturing  jobs  and  rising  labor \nproductivity in manufacturing relative to other sectors, we should expect: (H1) peak manufacturing \nemployment shares to decline; and (H2) both employment and output shares to peak at lower and \nlower income levels over time. Moreover, to the extent that economies can switch to more capital-\nintensive products and techniques as incomes rise, and to the extent that labor productivity increases \ndrive manufacturing employment down, (H3) both trends (i.e., H1 and H2) should be more apparent \nin employment than in output shares.  The paper tests these three hypotheses. \n \nTo shed light on these issues, we compile a carefully cleaned data set on manufacturing \nemployment shares for 52 economies that is consistent over time. Reliable data on manufacturing \nemployment shares over time have been available for a relatively small set of economies, most of \nwhich have, at some point in their history, supported high levels of manufacturing employment. It is \ntherefore unknown, even as a historical fact, whether economies that failed to generate a large number \nof manufacturing jobs actually fared worse than those that did generate such jobs. We also have \noutput share data for these same economies and for a further 83 economies. These data sets permit us \nto test whether there are particular thresholds in manufacturing employment and output that high-\nincome economies have tended to cross. Our main contributions to the literature are two novel \nfindings. First, that manufacturing employment is a better predictor of prosperity than manufacturing \noutput;  and  second,  that  economies  are  finding  more  difficult  to  sustain  high  manufacturing \nemployment shares (but not output shares) as their incomes rise. \n \nTable 1 shows the peak and current manufacturing employment and output shares for a group \nof advanced and developing economies. Employment shares in advanced economies peaked earlier \nand at significantly higher levels than in developing economies. Current employment shares, on the \nother hand, are slightly lower in advanced economies. Peak output shares, in contrast, have not fallen \nnearly as much. \n   \n\u00a0", "Manufacturing Matters\u2026 but It\u2019s the Jobs that Count   |   3 \nTable 1: Peak and Current Manufacturing Shares, Selected Economies \n(Ordered by year of peak manufacturing employment share) \n \nEmployment Shares (%)  Output Shares (%) \nPeak  Latest  Peak  Latest \nYear  Level  Year   Level  Year  Level  Year   Level \nUnited Kingdom  1970  34.7  2008  12.0  1970  28.9  2010  10.7 \nUnited States  1970  26.4  2009  10.4  1972  23.8  2010  12.9 \nArgentina  1970  22.6  2005  11.5  1976  38.7  2010  20.5 \nPhilippines  1971  11.3  2008  8.6    1973  28.9  2008  21.4 \nJapan  1973  27.5  2008  18.4  1973  32.4  2010  19.4 \nBrazil  1986  16.4  2007  13.4  1980  33.3  2010  16.2 \nKorea, Republic of  1989  27.8  2008  16.8  2010  30.3  2010  30.3 \nMexico  1990  20.0  2008  16.9  1988  23.2  2010  18.3 \nIndia  2001  14.8  2005  13.6  1995  18  2010  14.7 \nIndonesia  2002  12.9  2008  12.0  1997  29.4  2010  24.8 \nChina, People\u2019s Republic of  2010  16.9  2010  16.9  1978  40.5  2010  29.6 \n                             \nNotes: Peak shares are calculated as 7-year (centered) moving averages from 1970 to 2010.

Section VI is dedicated to interpretation, caveats, and \nconclusions. \n \n \nII.   DATA \n \nOur data on manufacturing employment shares come from a variety of sources, some of them spliced \ntogether. Data for four of our 52 economies come solely from the Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development (OECD) Stan database, and data for another four come solely from the \nGroningen Growth Development Center (GGDC).  We calculated the PRC\u2019s shares directly from the \nCensus.2  The  remaining  economies  all  utilize  data  from  the  International  Labour  Organization\u2019s \n(ILO\u2019s) LABORSTA database. LABORSTA often provides multiple estimates for the same economy \nand time period, differentiated by source, sampling restrictions, and sector classification systems.  We \nhave  carefully  selected  the  series  to  achieve  maximum  consistency,  and  cleaned  these  data \nmeticulously, as explained in Appendix A. Data from a further 17 economies come from LABORSTA \nalone. However, in some cases, the LABORSTA series begin late into our sample period or end early. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2   We opted for the PRC\u2019s census over data from the Statistical yearbooks, because the yearbook data are considered less \nreliable (Li and Gibson 2013), and do not cover the rural sector post-2003. \n\u00a0", "4   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 420 \nWhere this is the case, we impute earlier and later employment shares using growth rates derived from \nthe OECD Stan database (12 economies) or the GGDC data (six economies). For a further eight \neconomies, we use GGDC data and fill in the gaps using growth rates calculated from LABORSTA. \nPrior to splicing series together, we corroborated that, for the common periods (i.e., periods when two \nsources provided data), the correlation between the two series was above 0.9.  The list of sources for \nemployment shares used for each economy is provided in Appendix A.   \n \nManufacturing output shares are from the United Nations (UN) Statistics Division (SD). They \ncapture the sector\u2019s share in value added, measured in current dollars. These data were sufficiently \ncomplete for an additional 83 economies. The UN does not provide output share data for the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) and Taipei,China, and so we obtained these value-added shares from the \nWorld Bank\u2019s current price series. While this series is slightly less comprehensive than the UN\u2019s, the \ncorrelation between the two series across time and economies is 0.94.   \n \nIn sum, we have output share data for 135 economies, out of which we have sufficient \nemployment share data for 52. Sufficient, in this case, means that we have at least five observed \nemployment shares for the economy, including one as far in the past as the early 1980s and one in the \nnew millennium. On average, each economy has 34 observed employment shares. Appendix A also \nprovides  the  number  of  observed  employment  shares,  and  earliest  and  latest  dates  of  these \nobservations for each economy. On average, the 52 economies with sufficient employment data had \nhigher incomes both during 2005\u20132010 and in the year the manufacturing output share peaked, than \nthe 83 economies without sufficient employment data. They also have bigger populations, higher peak \nmanufacturing  output  shares  and  experienced  their  peak  manufacturing  output  share  earlier. \nAppendix A contains the details.  \n \nWe also draw upon the following series: per capita GDP in 2005 constant dollars (WDI); \npopulation (UNSD); and years of schooling in the population aged 15 and above (Barro and Lee 2010).  \nMissing observations on these variables (other than those at the start and end of the time series) are \nfilled in through log-linear interpolation.   \n \nAs we discuss in Appendix B, small island economies are quite different structurally to larger, \nnon-island nations. They have lower output shares, and structural endowments (land, demographics) \nare much more important for explaining the behavior of output shares in small island nations than in \nother nations. Data from small island nations are also often incomplete. We therefore exclude all island \neconomies with a 1990 population of less than one million from our sample.  We also exclude nations \nthat have split up or unified over the course of our sample to ensure meaningful analysis.  \n \nWe subjected the panel data set of output shares used in Section V to yet further cleaning \nprocedures. We dropped observations of output shares if the UN and World Bank\u2019s estimates of \ncurrent price output shares for that economy and year differed by more than 1 percentage point and by \na factor at least 30%; and for those observations lacking estimates from the World Bank, if the UN \nconstant and current price shares differ by more than 1 percentage point and a factor of at least 50%.  \nThis restricts the sample to observations in which we have greater confidence. \n \nFinally, we note that we may have underestimated recent manufacturing employment and \noutput shares due to the unbundling of many production processes that used to be included in \n\u00a0", "Manufacturing Matters\u2026 but It\u2019s the Jobs that Count   |   5 \nmanufacturing but now are part of services.3 This does raise the possibility that we have overestimated \nthe rate at which manufacturing activity has declined.  We are nevertheless quite confident that much \nof the recent difficulty with sustaining manufacturing activity that we document is real. We consider \nthese arguments in the concluding section after presenting our empirical results. \n \n \nIII.  CROSS-SECTIONAL EVIDENCE ON THE IMPORTANCE AND FEASIBILITY OF \nATTAINING HIGH MANUFACTURING EMPLOYMENT SHARES \n \nThis section uses cross-sectional data to show a key result of this paper, namely, that there is a strong \npositive  relationship  between  the  maximum  manufacturing  employment  share  that  an  economy \nachieved in the last 40 years and its per capita GDP today. This result does not hold as strongly for \nmanufacturing output shares. We also test the three hypotheses motivated in the introduction: (H1) \nmanufacturing  employment  shares  have  declined  over  time,  (H2)  the  income  levels  at  which \nemployment and output shares peak have declined over time, and (H3) these two trends are more \nacute for employment than for output shares. The trends discussed here will be analyzed in detail in \nSections IV and V.  \n \nFigure  1  shows  that  there  is  a  positive  and  statistically  significant  relationship  between \neconomies\u2019 income per capita in 2005\u20132010 and the peak historical manufacturing employment \nshare. The relationship with output shares is also positive, but much noisier.  This is our first indication \nthat manufacturing employment is more important than manufacturing output as a determinant of \neventual prosperity. Manufacturing shares are calculated as 7-year moving averages from 1970 to \n2010, and the peak is the highest of all these moving averages. There are economies that achieved \nshares of over 30%, with Hong Kong, China hitting over 40%; and economies that attained much lower \nshares. \n \nRegression 1 in Panel A of Table 2 shows that economies that achieved high peak employment \nshares in the past are richer today. Indeed, controlling for the peak manufacturing employment shares, \npeak manufacturing output shares are statistically insignificant. A 1 percentage point difference in the \npeak manufacturing employment share is associated with a final per capita GDP that is 13% higher. \nRegression 2 shows that the slope of the best fit line in Figure 1 is statistically significant, while \nRegression 3 shows that, on their own, peak manufacturing output shares have very little explanatory \npower (note the much lower R-squared statistic). These regressions suggest that the industrialization \nprocess predicts future prosperity only insofar as it generates manufacturing jobs. Regression 4 adds \nthe value of EXPY in the year the employment share peaked. EXPY is a proxy measure for the \nsophistication of an economy\u2019s  export mix calculated using product (not services) data, and known to \nbe a solid predictor of an economy\u2019s subsequent export performance (Hausmann, Hwang, and Rodrik \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n3   Many manufacturing companies are outsourcing non-core operation (e.g., marketing, warehousing, transport, information \ntechnology) and many manufactured products are increasingly bundled with a host of services (e.g., after-sales services, \nsuch as extended warranties, repair services, telephone help-lines). This has been a process where manufacturing firms \nhave shed many of their services functions to increase efficiency. They appear in the National Accounts as \u201cproducer \nservices,\u201d separate from manufacturing. These outsourced service firms produce for manufacturing firms, i.e., without \nthese services, the products would not reach consumers. All these services could perhaps be considered as part of \nmanufacturing. These interconnections between manufacturing and services are well known, but are not properly \nestimated and accounted for in the statistics. Precise estimates require industry and country-specific data, most often not \navailable. \n\u00a0", "6   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 420 \n2007). As expected, what an economy-  exports matters; but even with this correction, manufacturing \nemployment is still strongly related to future prosperity.    \n \nFigure 1: Peak Manufacturing Employment and Subsequent Prosperity\n \n  a.

It shows that peak employment shares have fallen over \ntime, with peaks averaging around 25% and often exceeding 30% until the mid-1980s, averaging 20% \nand rarely crossing 30% until the mid-1990s, and peaks below 20% during the last 15 years.

The third regression shows that \noutput shares have not fallen even when we expand the analysis to include economies that do not \nhave good employment shares.

ARE INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES RICH? \n \nMotivated by the findings above, in particular by the positive relationship between income per capita \nand the peak manufacturing employment shares (Figure 1, and Panel A of Table 2), we investigate here \nwhether all rich economies industrialized, and whether all economies that industrialized are rich. We \ndo this by asking whether there are thresholds for manufacturing output and employment shares that \ndistinguish rich from non-rich economies. \n \nWe classify an economy as \u201crich\u201d if its average per capita GDP during 2005\u20132010 exceeds \nsome cutoff. A cutoff of $12,000 in 2005 prices (not PPP corrected) is a convenient benchmark, \ncorresponding roughly to the World Bank\u2019s definition of a high-income economy. Using this cutoff, \nexactly half of the 52 economies for which we have employment data are rich.  We will also see what \nhappens if we use different cutoffs. We will similarly propose that economies have \u201cindustrialized in \nemployment\u201d if their manufacturing employment shares crossed a particular threshold at any point \nbetween 1970 and 2010. Industrialization in output is defined analogously.  \n\u00a0", "10   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 420 \n \nWe experiment with multiple thresholds for manufacturing shares. For a given income cutoff \nand threshold manufacturing share, we will conclude that industrialization (I) has been necessary for \nbecoming  rich  (R)  if  we  observe  in  the  data  that  all  rich  economies  industrialized  (i.e.,  no \nindustrialization, no high income; Pr(R|~I)=0); and we will say that it is a sufficient condition if we \nobserve that all economies that have industrialized are rich (i.e., industrialization guarantees rich-\ncountry status; Pr(R|I)=1). We will also select, for each income cutoff, the threshold manufacturing \nshare that gives us the most separation between rich and non-rich economies  (i.e., the level of I\u2014\nmanufacturing share, that maximizes \u0394 \u2261 Pr(R|I) - Pr(R|~I)). The higher this difference is, the more \npowerful the manufacturing share becomes as a predictor of eventual prosperity. If crossing some \nmanufacturing share threshold is both necessary and sufficient for being rich (i.e., Pr(R|I) - Pr(R|~I)=1), \nthe  set  of  industrialized  economies  and  rich  economies  would  coincide,  a  situation  that  would \ncorrespond  to  the  traditional  usage  of  the  term  \u201cindustrialized  nation.\u201d  We  will  examine  these \nrelationships  separately  for  employment-  and  output-based  definitions  of  industrialization.    We \nemphasize  that  we  use  the  terms  \u201cprobability,\u201d  \u201cnecessary,\u201d  and  \u201csufficient\u201d  strictly  to  describe \nhistorical  data,  and  not  as  statements  of  what  is  theoretically  possible.  We  will  return  to  the \nimplications of our results for economies\u2019 future prospects in Section VI. \n \nTable 3 shows Pr(R|I) in the top panel and Pr(R|~I) in the bottom panel, calculated using \nemployment  shares  (using  data  for  52  economies).  The  first  column  in  each  panel  gives  the \npercentage of economies that have reached the income per capita shown in each row (e.g., 57.7% of \nthe  economies  achieved  incomes  over  $6,000).  The  last  row  in  the  top  and  bottom  panels, \nrespectively,  provide  the  percentage  of  economies  that  did  and  did  not  cross  the  threshold \nmanufacturing share indicated in each column (e.g., 65.4% of the 52 economies  reached a peak \nmanufacturing employment share of 18%, and the other 34.6% did not).  We have also marked in \nboldface the cells within each row corresponding to the employment threshold that maximizes Pr(R|I) \n- Pr(R|~I) for the income level in that row. For example, for a per capita income of $12,000 this \ndifference is maximized at a threshold of 18% (Pr(R|I) - Pr(R|~I)=0.765-0=0.765, which is the largest \ndifference for that income level.  \n \nThese figures indicate that having crossed an 18% employment threshold between 1970 and \n2010 is necessary for achieving $12,000 per capita income today (Pr(R|~I)=0); and having achieved \nthis share fairly strongly predicts being a rich economy today (Pr(R|I)=0.765<1).  Table 3 indicates that \na 16% threshold is optimal for separating the economies that have and have not crossed $6,000; 18% is \noptimal for $8,000\u2013$22,000; and 20% is optimal for $24,000\u2013$30,000.  In all but one of these cases, \nachieving the employment share threshold is necessary for crossing the income cutoff; no economy \nthat failed to cross 16% (18%; 20%) achieved a per capita income of $6,000 ($8,000\u2013$22,000; \n$24,000\u2013$30,000). Achieving these threshold shares is not sufficient for crossing any income cutoff. \nHowever, the top panel does reveal that 90.9%\u201395.5% of economies that attained 24% manufacturing \nemployment shares did reach $6,000\u2013$18,000 per capita income. The takeaway is, therefore, that \npeak manufacturing employment shares in excess of 18%\u201320% strongly predict that an economy is \nrich; while peak shares below this threshold are near perfect predictors that an economy is not rich (i.e., \nmanufacturing employment is necessary for becoming rich). Achieving employment shares of roughly \n18%\u201320% is, therefore, a fairly good definition of industrialization. \n \n \n\u00a0", "Manufacturing Matters\u2026 but It\u2019s the Jobs that Count   |   11 \nTable 3: Probabilities of Being Rich, Conditional on Achieving Manufacturing Employment Share Thresholds \nA.

However, the separation is very \npoor. The largest observed value for Pr(R|I) - Pr(R|~I) is only 0.296, occurring at an output share \nthreshold of 22% and an income cutoff of $6,000. In contrast, for employment shares, the largest \nobserved value is 0.789, at an employment threshold of 16% and the same $6,000 income cutoff. \nUnsurprisingly, then, the table also shows that industrialization in output is not sufficient to achieve a \nhigh income per capita, as no output share cutoff guarantees that an economy crosses any income \nthreshold; and that it is not necessary either, that is, failure to cross a given output share threshold does \nnot ensure failure to become rich.  \n \nWhen we restrict the output sample to the 52 economies for which we have employment data \n(table available on request), the separation improves, but it is still not as good as it is for employment \nshares. The values of Pr(R|I) - Pr(R|~I) now range from 0.41 to 0.59; the result that industrialization in \noutput is not sufficient to become rich remains; but now we find that industrialization in output is \nnecessary to cross one income threshold: no economy with a peak manufacturing share of 18% or \nlower crossed $22,000 per capita income. Compared with the results in Tables 3 and 4, this suggests \nthat output shares are not particularly good predictors of which small economies (many of which lack \nemployment data) will be rich; that output shares provide some signal in the economies in our \nemployment sample; and that employment shares are much better predictors of eventual prosperity \nthan output shares. \n \nHow do the findings in this analysis classify economies? To see this, we return to the $12,000 \ncutoff  for  being  rich  and  separately  pick  employment  and  output  share  thresholds  that  provide \nmaximal separation between rich and poor economies in our 52-economy sample, that is, 18% for \nemployment, and 22% for output. Table 5 categorizes economies by their industrialization status in \nemployment and output using these thresholds, and highlights the rich economies in bold.  Although \nthe threshold for output shares is higher than the threshold for employment shares, these thresholds \nclassify exactly the same number of economies (34) as industrialized in output and employment, \nrespectively. This indicates that the horse-race we are about to run between employment and output \nshares is fair. We find that all high-income economies have industrialized in employment, but six high-\nincome economies (Canada; Denmark; Greece; Hong Kong, China; Norway; and Portugal) did not \nindustrialize in output. Indeed, if we restrict attention to those that have industrialized in employment, \nthose that did not industrialize in output are more likely to be rich than those that did (6/7 > 20/27). \nClearly, if we were to select one target, it would be employment shares, not output shares. \n \nSumming up, this analysis indicates that achieving some critical output share has generally \nbeen neither necessary nor sufficient for achieving high-income status. On the other hand, achieving a \nmanufacturing employment share of 18%\u201320% has been almost sufficient and absolutely necessary (in \nthe statistical sense) for achieving high-income status. \n \n ", "14   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 420 \nTable 4: Probabilities of Being Rich, Conditional on Achieving Manufacturing Output Share Thresholds (135 economies)\n \nA.

The inverted U-shape is an old idea that goes back to \nthe pioneering work of Chenery (1960) and Kuznets (1966), among others. While Figure 5 confirms \nthis result, Figure 4 is more interesting. Pooling economies and years within decades, we see no general \ntrend for manufacturing employment shares to decline with income, during the 1970s, 1980s or 1990s, \neven at high incomes. However, the concavity of this profile increases with each decade, to the point \nthat there is actually a peak expected employment share by the 2000s at a per capita income of \naround $13,000. \n \nThe regression lines in Figures 4 and 5 are partly identified of differences between economies. \nThey are not representative of economies\u2019 trajectories over time. For example, the apparently constant \nupward trajectory of manufacturing employment shares with income in the first three decades of our \nsample  might  simply  reflect  the  fact  that  the  original  OECD  economies  were  richer  and  more \nindustrialized than the developing economies during this period. In this case, the results offer little \ninsight  into  whether  developing  economies  would  have  been  able  to  continually  increase  their \nmanufacturing shares as they became richer. Therefore, they would not provide the right comparisons \nfor analyzing the structural possibilities that economies have faced, or for testing the three hypotheses \ngenerated by the discussion in the introduction to the paper. That task is better accomplished by \ncomparisons within economies over time.  This requires regressions with country fixed effects.  \n \nWe  therefore  estimate  logarithmic  regressions  of  output  (Y)  and  employment  (L) \nmanufacturing shares ((cid:1838)(cid:1845)(cid:3014) ) on income per capita (LGDPPC) and income per capita squared as well \n(cid:3026),(cid:3013)\nas  a  time  trend  (T),  and  the  interaction  between  the  time  trend  and  income  per  capita.  This \nspecification embeds the three hypotheses we motivated in the introduction. Specifically, the time \ntrend allows us to test whether manufacturing shares, conditional on income levels, have declined over \ntime (H1); and, where the inverted U-shape is confirmed, whether expected peak shares have fallen. \n\u00a0", "Manufacturing Matters\u2026 but It\u2019s the Jobs that Count   |   19 \nThe interaction between time and log income per capita allows us to test whether the income per \ncapita at which the manufacturing share peaks has declined over time (H2).  Comparing the results for \nthe employment and output share regressions allows us to test whether these trends are more readily \nobserved in employment than in output shares (H3). For the reasons just explained, we introduce \ncountry fixed effects, which would reflect, for example, differences in geography, institutions, and \nhistory. Some specifications also control for population (LPOP) and education levels (EDU), whose \nlevel effects are subsumed in the fixed effects (FE), but whose growth rates vary considerably across \neconomies.

The  peak \nmanufacturing employment shares predicted for a \u201ctypical\u201d economy are provided at the bottom.  A \ntypical economy is one with an average intercept term.  When no fixed effects are used, all economies \nare assumed to be \u201ctypical.\u201d \n \nRegressions (1)\u2013(4) are introduced to examine the role of fixed effects, and to assess whether \nthe  inverted  U-shape  has  shifted  to  the  left.    The  regression  in  column  (5)  is  our  preferred \nspecification, because it allows country fixed effects, interactions between income and time, and \ncontrols for log population (normalized to have a mean of zero) and its square.  Population growth is \ndriven by many factors other than the structure of production; but, by providing a growing market for \nmanufactured goods, it can exert a strong effect on the size of the industrial sector.  Post-estimation \nresults indicate that larger populations are conducive to higher manufacturing employment shares, \nuntil a population level of 182 million. This seems entirely reasonable given that manufacturing is an \nincreasing-returns-to-scale activity that produces tradable goods subject to transport costs (Krugman \n1991). \n \nOur first major finding is that country fixed effects matter. Table 6 includes the standard \ndeviation of the country fixed effects, in order to examine how much inter-country variation in \nmanufacturing employment shares is not explained by our independent variables. These show that \nproclivities to manufacturing employment vary widely across economies.

Comparing \n(3) to (1) and (4) to (2), shows that the per capita incomes at which manufacturing employment is \nestimated to peak declines enormously when fixed effects are introduced. Thus, today\u2019s industrializing \neconomies should not base their assessments of the feasibility of industrializing in employment on the \nexperiences of earlier industrializers. Such comparisons, which are captured by the regressions without \ncountry fixed effects, are misleading. \n \nThe second finding is a clear confirmation of H1, i.e., manufacturing employment shares have \ndeclined over time. This is apparent from the decline in the peak employment share expected by a \ntypical economy as well as the negative and statistically significant derivatives of the shares with \nrespect to the year (not shown\u2014any positive coefficients on the year are more than compensated by \nthe negative coefficients on the interaction between the year and log per capita GDP).   \n \nThird, the results also confirm H2, i.e., manufacturing employment peaks at lower levels of per \ncapita income over time.  The coefficient on the interaction between per capita GDP and income is \nnegative  and  highly  significant,  and  (in  regression  5)  the  income  level  of  peak  manufacturing \nemployment fell from $33,994 in 1970, to $9,576 in 2010.

The fixed effects, correcting for income and population, \nshow whether a nation \u201cpunches above its weight\u201d in sustaining manufacturing employment shares. \nThe table also includes the median year of peak industrialization in each group of economies, and the \npopulation-weighted  average  of  the  country  fixed  effects.    The  dates  show  that  manufacturing \nemployment typically peaked earliest in high-income economies, followed by Latin American and \nCaribbean (LAC) nations, while Asia is peaking late. The fixed effects reveal that, on average, Asian \neconomies have sustained higher manufacturing employment shares than \u201cexpected,\u201d while high- \nincome and Latin American and Caribbean economies have typically sustained lower shares. These \nregional  comparisons  are  the  exact  inverse  of  what  we  would  have  expected  if  the  date  of \nindustrialization  had  been  the  only  factor  determining  the  manufacturing  share  that  could  be \nsustained. If that were the case, Asian economies, being late industrializers, should be at a relative \ndisadvantage. This suggests that there is indeed something different about Asian economies that \npermitted  them  to  sustain  high  levels  of  manufacturing  employment.  Policy  differences  are  one \npossibility. \n \nOne relatively easy-to-quantify possibility, given the East Asian experience, is education.  To \nexamine this, regression (6) in Table 6 adds a correction for years of schooling, which also enters \npositively, indicating that an educated population is helpful for sustaining manufacturing employment. \nConsistent with this, the unexplained inter-country variation in manufacturing employment shares \n(the standard deviation of the fixed effects) falls significantly when education is introduced as an \nexplanatory variable. \n \nThe fixed-effects regressions in Table 6 (regressions 4\u20136) show that the maximum expected \nemployment share for a typical economy has fallen to around 13%\u201316%. Together with the empirical \ndefinition  of  industrialization  we  derived  earlier  (i.e.,  that  industrialized  economies  achieved \nmanufacturing employment shares in excess of 18%\u201320%, a level that almost every now-rich country \nachieved at some point), this suggests that the path to prosperity through manufacturing employment \nmay have become more difficult. \n \nOutput shares \n \nTable 8 presents the analogous regressions for output shares (with 135 economies). Results confirm \nthe importance of including fixed effects in the analyses of possible manufacturing output shares\u2014\nfixed effects have high explanatory power and reduce the per capita GDP at which manufacturing \noutput shares are estimated to peak by roughly an order of magnitude. This is qualitatively similar to \nthe behavior of employment shares. Also, as with employment, large output shares are easier to sustain \nin more educated and populous economies. \n \nHowever, there are major differences between the behavior of employment and output shares. \nRegardless of whether country fixed effects are included or not, deindustrialization in output sets in at \na lower income (roughly $2,000) than does deindustrialization in employment. This may reflect the \neffects  of  Cost  Disease  (Baumol  2012),  wherein  higher  incomes  are  accompanied  by  higher \nmanufacturing labor productivity, and services that become expensive relative to manufactured goods.  \nThis further reduces the gradient of manufacturing output shares with respect to incomes.   \n ", "Manufacturing Matters\u2026 but It\u2019s the Jobs that Count   |   23 \nTable 7: Country Fixed Effects (Employment Share Regression 5) and Year of Peak Manufacturing Employment \nFixed  Peak  Fixed  Peak  Fixed  Peak \nEconomy/Region  Effect  Date  Economy/Region  Effect  Date  Economy/Region  Effect  Date \nHigh-income economies  -0.032  1971  Latin America and Caribbean  -0.031  1989  Asia  0.096  1992 \nAustralia  -0.321  1970  Argentina  -0.170  1970  Bangladesh  0.238  1992 \nAustria  0.251  1974  Bolivia  -0.117  2010  China, People's Republic of  0.129  2010 \nBelgium  0.062  1970  Brazil  -0.424  1988  Hong Kong, China  0.220  1974 \nCanada  -0.328  1970  Chile  -0.179  1971  India  0.259  1999 \nDenmark  0.089  1970  Colombia  -0.434  1993  Indonesia  -0.130  2000 \nFinland  0.152  1977  Costa Rica  0.099  1991  Korea, Republic of  -0.017  1989 \nFrance  -0.135  1971  El Salvador  0.202  1992  Malaysia  0.052  1995 \nGreece  -0.182  1989  Guatemala  0.128  1994  Pakistan  0.230  1979 \nIreland  0.080  1977  Honduras  0.216  1997  Philippines  -0.308  1973 \nItaly  -0.010  1977  Mexico  -0.205  1989  Singapore  0.386  1981 \nJapan  -0.064  1971  Panama  -0.309  1996  Thailand  -0.342  2004 \nLuxembourg  0.658  1971  Peru  -0.385  1971 \nNetherlands  -0.178  1970  Suriname  -0.117  1970  Other  0.003  1984 \nNorway  -0.041  1972  Trinidad and Tobago  -0.083  1978  Botswana  -0.425  1996 \nPortugal  0.146  1971  Venezuela, Bolivarian Republic of  -0.353  1985  Poland  0.108  1978 \nPuerto Rico  -0.078  1976  Romania  0.372  1986 \nSan Marino  2.247  1978  Syrian Arab Republic  0.083  1982 \nSpain  -0.098  1970 \nSweden  0.043  1972 \nSwitzerland  0.214  1970 \nUnited Kingdom  -0.109  1970 \nUnited States  -0.325  1970 \n                       \nNote: We provide median dates of peak manufacturing employment share (unweighted) in each region, and population-weighted average fixed effects for each region.  \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n \n ", "24   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 420 \nTable 8: Regressions of (Log) Manufacturing Output Shares over Time and across Economies\n(1)  (2)  (3)  (4)  (5)  (6) \nYear  -0.012***  (0.001)  -0.004   (0.003)  -0.002**   (0.001)  -0.005*   (0.003)  -0.013***  (0.003)  -0.009**  (0.003) \nLog GDP per capita x Year  -0.001  (0.001)  0.001  (0.000)  0.001  (0.000)  -0.000  (0.000) \nLog GDP per capita (LGDPPC)  0.774***  (0.050)  0.775***   (0.050)  1.537***  (0.090)  1.604***   (0.120)  1.490***  (0.124)  1.639***    (0.119) \nLGDPPC squared   -0.042***  (0.003)  -0.042***  (0.003)  -0.103***  (0.007)  -0.109***   (0.010)  -0.098***   (0.010)  -0.107***  (0.009) \nLog population  0.352***   (0.066)  0.284***  (0.049) \nLog population squared  -0.027***   (0.006)  -0.026***   (0.006) \nYears of schooling (Population aged 15+)  0.022**   (0.008) \nConstant  -0.646***  (0.197)  -0.674***    (0.197)  -2.791***    (0.311)  -2.956***   (0.367)  -2.55***    (0.367)  -3.230***   (0.386) \nCountry fixed effects?

The resulting decline of employment shares \nrelative to output shares is exactly what we would expect to see if rates of labor-saving technological \nchange have been higher in manufacturing than in the rest of the economy. With respect to H2, we \nlikewise find that the per capita income at which output shares peak has not decreased significantly. \nThis, in combination with the fact that the income level at which manufacturing employment peaks \nhas fallen, is consistent with the possibility that economies substituted capital-intensive for labor-\nintensive manufacturing activities as incomes rose. Together, these results confirm that sustaining \nmanufacturing output is becoming somewhat more difficult, and that rising incomes do not weigh \nheavily on the output levels that economies can sustain. The real problem economies face is with \nsustaining manufacturing employment. Thus, they confirm H3.    \n \n \nVI.   INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS \n \nWe have explored thoroughly the relationships between economic prosperity and manufacturing \noutput and employment shares. We have shown that all economies that are rich today have, at some \npoint in the last 40 years, enjoyed high manufacturing employment shares; while only a few economies \nthat  attained  high  manufacturing  employment  shares  are  not  rich  economies.  Manufacturing \nemployment has therefore been, as a matter of historical record, necessary but not sufficient for \neventual prosperity. This is quite consistent with two points demonstrated by Rodrik (2013a). First, \nthat economies that create many manufacturing jobs grow faster because manufacturing has an \n\u201cescalator\u201d quality\u2014labor productivity in manufacturing industries rises rapidly towards the global \nfrontier. Second, this is insufficient to ensure that poorer economies will grow faster than richer \neconomies because manufacturing constitutes a relatively small share of total employment. \n \nOur second contribution is to show that manufacturing employment shares have fallen, and \nnow go into decline at lower levels of per capita income than they once did.  Therefore, the fraction of \nnational workforces for which manufacturing serves as an escalator has declined, even in low-income \neconomies.  Once again, manufacturing output shares do not display these trends as strongly. Taken \nliterally, these results would appear to highlight the maintenance of manufacturing employment as one \nof the most important and difficult challenges that developing economies face today. \n \nOf course, these results cannot be taken literally without a clear understanding of the causal \nmechanisms that drive them. We have shown that the data are consistent with explanations involving \ntwo forces: rising own-price elasticities of manufacturing labor demand, and labor productivity that \nrises faster in manufacturing than in non-manufacturing activities.  However, two other alternative \nexplanations need to be considered.  \n \nOne is that, the result is purely mechanical. Suppose, in contrast to our story, that global labor \nproductivity in manufacturing and in other sectors grew at the same pace, and that the growth rates of \nmanufacturing outputs and of other products were identical. It follows that global manufacturing \nemployment shares would have remained constant.5 In this case, recent small increases in national \nmanufacturing employment shares in some populous developing economies (e.g., the PRC, India) \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n5   Aggregating across developing economies, Haraguchi (2014) finds that: (i) manufacturing\u2019s share in total output (added \nup across economies) has not changed since the 1970s, hovering around 20%\u201323%; and (ii) the aggregate manufacturing \nemployment share increased since 1970. ", "26   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 420 \nwould have to be accompanied by large declines in the corresponding shares in economies with \nsmaller populations. While we are confident that the large populations of recent industrializers are part \nof the story, the relatively small movements in manufacturing output shares are not consistent with \nthis purely mechanical explanation.  If our results for employment shares were entirely driven by the \nSouthward  migration  of  manufacturing  activity,  output  shares  should  have  moved  along  with \nemployment shares. \n \nAnother  possibility  is  that,  we  are  simply  capturing  the  increased  outsourcing  of \nmanufacturing-related services activity to dedicated service companies.6 Again, it seems likely that this \nexplains part of the declines in measured manufacturing shares, but not all of them.  After all, this \nclassification problem should afflict manufacturing output shares as well, and yet, these have not \nshifted downwards very fast, or leftwards at all. Finally, it is worth noting that if we add UNIDO\u2019s \n(2013)  estimate  of  outsourced  or  manufacturing-related  jobs  to  our  figures,  manufacturing \nemployment shares would increase by around 20%. If we apply this increase to developing and \ndeveloped economies alike, many low and middle-income economies would still fail to reach the 18%\u2013\n20% manufacturing employment share threshold (e.g., Bangladesh, Indonesia, the Philippines, and \nmost economies in the Middle East and North Africa, Central Asia, and Central America). \n \nTwo final comments, offered in closing. First, why is it that manufacturing employment shares \nhave much clearer relationships with concurrent and subsequent income levels than output shares? \nOne possibility is that output shares are influenced by the price of manufactured relative to non-\nmanufactured outputs, which vary with incomes and across economies. We have already argued that \nthese  relative  price  differences  may  explain  why  output  shares  peak  at  lower  incomes  than \nemployment shares. Variations in this relative price may also confound efforts to identify relationships \nwith output shares.   \n \nSecond, with the scope for manufacturing growth limited by the structural forces we have \nidentified as well as by the increasing awareness of the high carbon footprint of many industries, and \nthe possibility of restrictions on carbon emissions to avoid the negative effects of climate change \n(Gutowski 2007, Stern 2007), we need to consider whether economies can get rich by shifting to \nservices without achieving high manufacturing employment shares. While it is impossible to rule out \nthis possibility (given the growing array of new services and service-delivery modes, some of which \nappear to have rather high economies of scale (e.g., Maroto-S\u00e1nchez and Cuadrado-Roura 2009), \nSection IV demonstrates there are not yet any examples of economies that have done so successfully. \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n6   UNIDO (2013) reckons that manufacturing employment is underestimated because informal manufacturing jobs and \njobs in manufacturing-related services are not properly counted. UNIDO has estimated the latter worldwide for 1970\u2013\n2009. In 2009, the number of these jobs was 95 million, or almost half of the direct formal jobs globally in manufacturing, \nand that 32 million of these jobs were in developed economies. We have spoken with UNIDO staff about how these jobs \nwere estimated and their reliability. UNIDO has advised that their estimates are a first approximation that can certainly be \nused, but with great caution. \n\u00a0", "\u00a0\nAPPENDIX A: EMPLOYMENT DATA \n \nThe cleaning of the ILO\u2019s LABORSTA data proceeded as follows. We began with the full LABORSTA \ndatabase. In any given economy and year, these data can include estimates from more than one \nsource, and the sources may use different sectoral classifications. From this, we kept observations \ncollected according to the International Standard Industrial Classification, versions 2, 3, or 4, and \ndropped the others. We then dropped sources that exclude major sections of the workforce (e.g., rural \nresidents, agricultural workers). In those instances where employment levels in some sectors were \nmissing, but could be inferred from total employment and employment in other sectors, we filled in the \nblanks and checked to see whether this yielded discontinuities in the series. Where discontinuities \nwere observed, the series corresponding to that economy and source were dropped.   \n \nAfter these adjustments, some economies still had multiple sources in some years. For these \neconomy-year pairs with overlapping series, we opted to use the longest continuous series.  When the \nseries had the same length, we chose the one that used ISIC revision 2. The final series were checked \ngraphically for anomalies. \n \nTable A.1: List of Economiesby Source\n \nLABORSTA only  Bangladesh, Botswana, El Salvador, Guatemala,Honduras, Pakistan, Panama, Poland, \nPortugal, Puerto Rico, Romania, San Marino, Suriname, Switzerland, Syria, Trinidad \nand Tobago, United Kingdom \nOECD only  Belgium,Denmark, France, Ireland, \nGGDC only  Argentina, Bolivia, India, Peru\nLABORSTA + OECD growth rate  Australia, Austria, Canada, Finland, Greece, Italy,Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, \nSpain, Sweden, United States  \nLABORSTA + GGDC growth rate  Chile; Costa Rica;HongKong, China;Japan;Republic of Korea; Malaysia \nGGDC + LABORSTA growth rate  Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Mexico, Philippines,Singapore, Thailand, Venezuela\nNational Census  People\u2019s Republic of China\nSource: Authors. \n\u00a0 \u00a0", "28   |   Appendix A: Employment Data \n \nTable A.2: Coverage of Manufacturing Employment Shares \n \n# of  Earliest  Latest  # of  Earliest  Latest \nEconomy  Obs.

The \ndata in Figure B1 are raw. They have not been corrected for exogenous determinants.  While an \ninverted U-shape is observed for non-small island nations in both time periods, no evidence of an \ninverted U-shape appears for small island nations in the latter 20 years of our sample.  Small island \nnations are also clearly different, in that they have lower manufacturing output shares than other \neconomies. \n \nFigure B1: All Economies, Split by SmallIsland, No Corrections \n \n  1970\u20131990  1991-2010 \n4 4\n2 2\n0 0\n-2 -2\n4 6 8 10 12 4 6 8 10 12\nlgdppc lgdppc  \nNotes: Green dots are island nations. Blue dots are non-island nations. \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n \nNext, to examine these structural issues further, we regressed the output shares on the year, \nyear-squared, and several structural features. These are: natural resource exports as a share of total \nexports in 1990, log population, log per capita land endowment, the share of land that is usable for \nagriculture, and the ratios of retirees and young people to the working-age population. Results are \navailable on request. The key differences between small island nations and other nations are: (i) small \nisland nations have a lower intercept (smaller manufacturing shares, other things equal), suggesting \nthat manufacturing activity is  hard to sustain  in more remote economies; and (ii) while  natural \nresource intensity reduces manufacturing output in other nations, it increases it in islands, again \nsuggesting  that  island  nations  without  natural  resources  of  their  own  find  it  difficult  to  sustain \nmanufacturing. \n \nFinally, figure B2 graphs the residuals from these regressions against log per capita GDP.  With \nthese corrections for underlying structural features firmly in place, we now see much clearer evidence \nof an inverted U with respect to per capita income for island nations. All these results suggest that per \ncapita GDP has been a relatively less important determinant of manufacturing output shares in island \nnations,  but  that  structural  factors  have  been  relatively  important.    To  avoid  complications,  we \ntherefore do not include them in our analysis.

Manufacturing output share thresholds are much \npoorer predictors of rich-country status. We also find that the maximum expected employment share for a \ntypical economy has fallen to around 13%\u201315%. Industrialization in employment has been more important \nfor eventual prosperity than industrialization in output; and high manufacturing employment shares are \nbecoming more difficult to sustain as incomes rise.
