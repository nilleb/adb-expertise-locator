Its mission is to help its developing member \n\ncountries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, \n\nit remains home to approximately two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: 1.6 billion people who live on less than $2 \n\na day, with 733 million struggling on less than $1.25 a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through \n\ninclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for \n\nhelping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, \n\nand technical assistance.\n\nMAnufACTurIng \nMATTers\u2026 BuT IT\u2019s The \nJoBs ThAT CounT\n\nJesus Felipe, Aashish Mehta, and Changyong Rhee\n\nno. 420\n\nnovember 2014\n\nadb economics\nworking paper series\n\nAsiAn Development BAnk\n\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\n\nwww.adb.org\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n\n\f\u00a0\n\nADB Economics Working Paper Series \n\n \n  \nManufacturing Matters\u2026 but It\u2019s the Jobs That Count \n \n \nJesus Felipe, Aashish Mehta, \nand Changyong Rhee \n\n \n\nNo. 420   |   2014 \n\nJesus Felipe (jfelipe@adb.org) is Advisor in the \nEconomics and Research Department of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank.

We  find  that  practically  every  economy  that  enjoys  a  high \nincome today experienced a manufacturing employment share in excess of 18%\u201320% sometime since \nthe 1970s. Manufacturing output share thresholds are much poorer predictors of rich-country status \nthan their employment counterparts. This motivates us to ask whether it is becoming more difficult to \nsustain high levels of manufacturing activity. We find that the maximum expected employment share \nfor  a  typical  developing  economy  has  fallen  to  around  13%\u201315%,  and  that  deindustrialization  in \nemployment  sets  in  at  much  lower  income  per  capita  levels  of  $8,000\u2013$9,000,  than  it  once  did. \nNeither  manufacturing  output  shares,  nor  the  level  of  income  at  which  they  decline  have  fallen  as \nobviously.  These  results  are  consistent  with  the  idea  that  industrialization  in  employment  terms  has \nbeen more important for eventual prosperity than has industrialization in output terms; and that high \nmanufacturing  employment  shares  are  becoming  more  difficult  to  sustain  as  incomes  rise.  This \nsuggests that the path to prosperity through industrialization may have become more difficult. \n \n \n \n \nKeywords: industrialization, inverted U-shape, manufacturing \n \nJEL Classification: O14 \n\n\u00a0\n\n\f\u00a0\n\nI.  \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \nThis  paper  asks  two  complementary  questions.  First,  whether  today\u2019s  developing  economies  can \nachieve high-income status without first building large manufacturing sectors; and second, whether it \nis becoming more difficult to sustain high levels of manufacturing activity. These are relevant questions \nbecause a long tradition  in development economics holds that  manufacturing is the  engine of growth \n(Kaldor 1966; Chenery, Robinson, and Syrquin 1986). However, as we discuss below, there is a growing \nperception that economies are finding it more difficult to sustain high levels of manufacturing output \nand employment while simultaneously increasing wages. \n \n\nThe relevance of manufacturing for economic growth derives from the fact that faster growth \nin  other  sectors  of  the  economy. \nin  productivity \nin  manufacturing  generates  faster  growth \nManufacturing  draws  resources  from  traditional  sectors  of  the  economy,  often  without  significantly \nreducing output in these sectors. Channeling these resources into manufacturing is beneficial because \nmanufactured  goods  have  high  income  elasticities  of  demand,  and  because  many  manufacturing \nactivities  are  produced  under  economies  of  scale.  Moreover,  manufacturing  has  a  potential  for \nproductivity catch-up that is unmatched by most services.1 Along these lines, recent research confirms \nthat  manufacturing  is  key  for  economic  development.  Rodrik  (2013a)  shows  that  manufacturing \nexhibits unconditional convergence in labor productivity\u2014industries that start farther away from the \nlabor  productivity  frontier  experience  significantly  faster  productivity  growth  even  without \nconditioning on variables, such as domestic policies, human capital, geography, or institutional quality. \nEconomies  with  higher  manufacturing  employment  shares  should  therefore  grow  faster.  See  also \nAmable  (2000),  Fagerberg  (2000),  Peneder  (2003),  Rodrik  (2009),  Szirmai  (2012),  Szirmai  and \nVerspagen (2011), and UNIDO (2013).  \n\n \nin  their \nFor  these  reasons,  many  national  governments  have  targeted  manufacturing \ndevelopment plans. For example, India\u2019s 2011 National Manufacturing Policy aims at raising the share \nof  manufacturing  in  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  to  25%  and  calls  for  setting  up  manufacturing \nzones  to  create  100  million  manufacturing  jobs.  The  Philippines  is  also  developing  a  comprehensive \nmanufacturing  road  map,  and  Indonesia  passed  a  new  Industry  Law  in  early  2014.  Developed \neconomies  like  the  United  States  (US),  Australia  or  the  members  of  the  European  Union,  are  also \ninterested  in  industrializing,  or  rather,  in  reindustrializing  after  decades  of  deindustrializing  (Helper, \nKrueger, and Wial 2012; Felipe, forthcoming 2015). \n\n \nAs  noted  above,  however,  there  is  a  growing  perception  that,  in  recent  times,  it  has  become \nmore  difficult  for  economies  to  sustain  high  levels  of  manufacturing  output  and  employment  while \nsimultaneously increasing wages and living standards (Rodrik 2009). This difficulty has been attributed \nto  at  least  two  forces.  First,  the  internationalization  of  supply  chains  and  increased  international \ncompetition are making the location of manufacturing activity more sensitive to wage improvements, \nother  things  equal  (Hasan,  Mitra,  and  Ramaswamy  2007;  Rodrik  1997).  This  phenomenon  tends  to \nreduce  manufacturing  output  and  employment  levels  more  in  high-wage,  high-income  economies, \nthan  in  their  poorer  counterparts.  To  the  extent  that  manufacturing  output  and  employment  shares \ntend  to  increase  with  income  per  capita  when  incomes  are  low,  and  then  to  decrease  with  incomes, \nfollowing  an  inverted  U-shape,  this  force  should  cause  the  per  capita  income  level  at  which \nmanufacturing employment and output shares peak to decline. However, to the extent that economies \nthat  experience  rising  wages  can  substitute  capital  for  labor,  this  shift  should  be  more  apparent  in \nemployment than in output shares. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n1   See the Symposium on Kaldor\u2019s Growth Laws, published in the Journal of Post Keynesian Economics (1983). \n\n\f2   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 420 \n\n \nSecond,  it  has  long  been  accepted  that  technological  change  has  placed  downward  pressure \non the sector\u2019s demand for less-skilled workers (Berman, Bound, and Griliches 1994; Berman, Bound, \nand Machin 1998; Goldin and Katz 2009), and there is now growing concern that technological change \nand the efficiencies that derive from globalized mass production are generally labor displacing (Cowen \n2013;  Brynjolfsson  and  McAffee  2014).  Faster  rates  of  labor-displacing  technological  change  in \nmanufacturing than in other sectors should push manufacturing employment shares down relative to \nmanufacturing  output  shares.  Rodrik  (2013b,  p.  52)  has  echoed  this  sentiment,  \u201cTechnological \nchanges  are  rendering  manufacturing  more  capital  and  skill  intensive,  reducing  the  employment \nelasticity  of  industrialization  and  the  capacity  of  manufacturing  to  absorb  large  volumes  of  unskilled \nlabor from the countryside and from the informal sector.\u201d Together, these hypothesized forces make \nus  wonder  whether  the  rapid  manufacturing-driven  growth  experienced  by  the  Republic  of  Korea, \nSingapore,  or  Taipei,China,  remains  possible  elsewhere.  If  it  has  become  less  likely,  is  there  any \nevidence of an alternative path to prosperity? \n\n \nThis  paper,  therefore,  answers  two  sets  of  questions.  First,  are  there  relevant  examples  of \neconomies  that  are  rich  today  but  did  not  attain  large  manufacturing  sectors  at  some  point  in  their \npast? Are there economies that did not achieve large manufacturing sectors and became rich anyway? \nAnd  has  manufacturing  employment  or  manufacturing  output  been  more  relevant  to  eventual \nprosperity? Second, is it indeed the case that high manufacturing employment and output shares are \nbecoming  more  difficult  to  sustain?  Specifically,  if,  as  hypothesized,  economies  are  experiencing  a \ncombination  of \nlabor \nproductivity  in  manufacturing  relative  to  other  sectors,  we  should  expect:  (H1)  peak  manufacturing \nemployment  shares  to  decline;  and  (H2)  both  employment  and  output  shares  to  peak  at  lower  and \nlower  income  levels  over  time.  Moreover,  to  the  extent  that  economies  can  switch  to  more  capital-\nintensive products and techniques as incomes rise, and to the extent that labor productivity increases \ndrive manufacturing employment down, (H3) both trends (i.e., H1 and H2) should be more apparent \nin employment than in output shares.  The paper tests these three hypotheses. \n\ninternational  competition  for  manufacturing \n\njobs  and  rising \n\nincreasing \n\n \nTo  shed  light  on  these  issues,  we  compile  a  carefully  cleaned  data  set  on  manufacturing \nemployment  shares  for  52  economies  that  is  consistent  over  time.  Reliable  data  on  manufacturing \nemployment  shares  over  time  have  been  available  for  a  relatively  small  set  of  economies,  most  of \nwhich  have,  at  some  point  in  their  history,  supported  high  levels  of  manufacturing  employment.  It  is \ntherefore unknown, even as a historical fact, whether economies that failed to generate a large number \nof  manufacturing  jobs  actually  fared  worse  than  those  that  did  generate  such  jobs.  We  also  have \noutput share data for these same economies and for a further 83 economies. These data sets permit us \nto  test  whether  there  are  particular  thresholds  in  manufacturing  employment  and  output  that  high-\nincome  economies  have  tended  to  cross.  Our  main  contributions  to  the  literature  are  two  novel \nfindings. First, that manufacturing employment is a better predictor of prosperity than manufacturing \noutput;  and  second,  that  economies  are  finding  more  difficult  to  sustain  high  manufacturing \nemployment shares (but not output shares) as their incomes rise. \n\n \nTable 1 shows the peak and current manufacturing employment and output shares for a group \nof  advanced  and  developing  economies.  Employment  shares  in  advanced  economies  peaked  earlier \nand  at  significantly  higher  levels  than  in  developing  economies.  Current  employment  shares,  on  the \nother hand, are slightly lower in advanced economies. Peak output shares, in contrast, have not fallen \nnearly as much. \n \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\fManufacturing Matters\u2026 but It\u2019s the Jobs that Count   |   3 \n\nTable 1: Peak and Current Manufacturing Shares, Selected Economies \n(Ordered by year of peak manufacturing employment share) \n \n\nEmployment Shares (%) \n\nPeak \n\nLatest \n\nLevel \n\nYear  \n\nLevel \n\nOutput Shares (%) \n\nPeak \n\nLevel \n\nLatest \n\nLevel \n\nYear \n\n1970 \n\n1970 \n\n1970 \n\n1971 \n\n1973 \n\n1986 \n\n1989 \n\n1990 \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2010 \n\n34.7 \n\n26.4 \n\n22.6 \n\n11.3 \n\n27.5 \n\n16.4 \n\n27.8 \n\n20.0 \n\n14.8 \n\n12.9 \n\n16.9 \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n2005 \n\n2008 \n\n2008 \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2008 \n\n2005 \n\n2008 \n\n2010 \n\n12.0 \n\n10.4 \n\n11.5 \n\n8.6 \n\n18.4 \n\n13.4 \n\n16.8 \n\n16.9 \n\n13.6 \n\n12.0 \n\n16.9 \n\n \n\nYear \n\n1970 \n\n1972 \n\n1976 \n\n1973 \n\n1973 \n\n1980 \n\n2010 \n\n1988 \n\n1995 \n\n1997 \n\n1978 \n\n28.9 \n\n23.8 \n\n38.7 \n\n28.9 \n\n32.4 \n\n33.3 \n\n30.3 \n\n23.2 \n\n18 \n\n29.4 \n\n40.5 \n\nYear  \n\n2010 \n\n2010 \n\n2010 \n\n2008 \n\n2010 \n\n2010 \n\n2010 \n\n2010 \n\n2010 \n\n2010 \n\n2010 \n\n10.7 \n\n12.9 \n\n20.5 \n\n21.4 \n\n19.4 \n\n16.2 \n\n30.3 \n\n18.3 \n\n14.7 \n\n24.8 \n\n29.6 \n\nUnited Kingdom \n\nUnited States \n\nArgentina \n\nPhilippines \n\nJapan \n\nBrazil \n\nMexico \n\nIndia \n\nIndonesia \n\nKorea, Republic of \n\nChina, People\u2019s Republic of \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nNotes: Peak shares are calculated as 7-year (centered) moving averages from 1970 to 2010.

We  also  test  hypotheses  H1,  H2  and  H3  through  inter-country  comparisons. \nMotivated by one key finding in Section III, Section IV asks whether all rich economies industrialized, \nand whether all economies that industrialized are rich. In Section V, we use panel data regressions to \nexamine  trends  in  manufacturing  employment  and  output  shares,  and  test  whether  our  three \nhypotheses  hold  within  economies  over  time.  Section  VI  is  dedicated  to  interpretation,  caveats,  and \nconclusions. \n\nII.  \n\nDATA \n\n \nOur data on manufacturing employment shares come from a variety of sources, some of them spliced \ntogether.  Data  for  four  of  our  52  economies  come  solely  from  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-\noperation and Development (OECD) Stan database, and data for another four come solely from the \nGroningen Growth Development Center (GGDC).  We calculated the PRC\u2019s shares directly from the \nCensus.2  The  remaining  economies  all  utilize  data  from  the  International  Labour  Organization\u2019s \n(ILO\u2019s)  LABORSTA  database.  LABORSTA  often  provides  multiple  estimates  for  the  same  economy \nand time period, differentiated by source, sampling restrictions, and sector classification systems.  We \nhave  carefully  selected  the  series  to  achieve  maximum  consistency,  and  cleaned  these  data \nmeticulously, as explained in Appendix A. Data from a further 17 economies come from LABORSTA \nalone. However, in some cases, the LABORSTA series begin late into our sample period or end early. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2   We opted for the PRC\u2019s census over data from the Statistical yearbooks, because the yearbook data are considered less \n\nreliable (Li and Gibson 2013), and do not cover the rural sector post-2003. \n\n \n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\f4   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 420 \n\nWhere this is the case, we impute earlier and later employment shares using growth rates derived from \nthe  OECD  Stan  database  (12  economies)  or  the  GGDC  data  (six  economies).  For  a  further  eight \neconomies,  we  use  GGDC  data  and  fill  in  the  gaps  using  growth  rates  calculated  from  LABORSTA. \nPrior to splicing series together, we corroborated that, for the common periods (i.e., periods when two \nsources provided data), the correlation between the two series was above 0.9.  The list of sources for \nemployment shares used for each economy is provided in Appendix A.   \n \n\nManufacturing output shares are from the United Nations (UN) Statistics Division (SD). They \ncapture  the  sector\u2019s  share  in  value  added,  measured  in  current  dollars.  These  data  were  sufficiently \ncomplete for an additional 83 economies. The UN does not provide output share data for the People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC)  and  Taipei,China,  and  so  we  obtained  these  value-added  shares  from  the \nWorld  Bank\u2019s  current  price  series.  While  this  series  is  slightly  less  comprehensive  than  the  UN\u2019s,  the \ncorrelation between the two series across time and economies is 0.94.   \n\n \nIn  sum,  we  have  output  share  data  for  135  economies,  out  of  which  we  have  sufficient \nemployment  share  data  for  52.  Sufficient,  in  this  case,  means  that  we  have  at  least  five  observed \nemployment shares for the economy, including one as far in the past as the early 1980s and one in the \nnew  millennium.  On  average,  each  economy  has  34  observed  employment  shares.  Appendix  A  also \nprovides  the  number  of  observed  employment  shares,  and  earliest  and  latest  dates  of  these \nobservations for each economy. On average, the 52 economies with sufficient employment data had \nhigher incomes both during 2005\u20132010 and in the year the manufacturing output share peaked, than \nthe 83 economies without sufficient employment data. They also have bigger populations, higher peak \nmanufacturing  output  shares  and  experienced  their  peak  manufacturing  output  share  earlier. \nAppendix A contains the details.  \n\n \nWe  also  draw  upon  the  following  series:  per  capita  GDP  in  2005  constant  dollars  (WDI); \npopulation (UNSD); and years of schooling in the population aged 15 and above (Barro and Lee 2010).  \nMissing observations on these variables (other than those at the start and end of the time series) are \nfilled in through log-linear interpolation.   \n\n \nAs we discuss in Appendix B, small island economies are quite different structurally to larger, \nnon-island nations. They have lower output shares, and structural endowments (land, demographics) \nare much more important for explaining the behavior of output shares in small island nations than in \nother nations. Data from small island nations are also often incomplete. We therefore exclude all island \neconomies with a 1990 population of less than one million from our sample.  We also exclude nations \nthat have split up or unified over the course of our sample to ensure meaningful analysis.  \n\n \nWe  subjected  the  panel  data  set  of  output  shares  used  in  Section  V  to  yet  further  cleaning \nprocedures.  We  dropped  observations  of  output  shares  if  the  UN  and  World  Bank\u2019s  estimates  of \ncurrent price output shares for that economy and year differed by more than 1 percentage point and by \na  factor  at  least  30%;  and  for  those  observations  lacking  estimates  from  the  World  Bank,  if  the  UN \nconstant and current price shares differ by more than 1 percentage point and a factor of at least 50%.  \nThis restricts the sample to observations in which we have greater confidence. \n\n \nFinally,  we  note  that  we  may  have  underestimated  recent  manufacturing  employment  and \noutput  shares  due  to  the  unbundling  of  many  production  processes  that  used  to  be  included  in \n\n\u00a0\n\n\fManufacturing Matters\u2026 but It\u2019s the Jobs that Count   |   5 \n\nmanufacturing but now are part of services.3 This does raise the possibility that we have overestimated \nthe rate at which manufacturing activity has declined.  We are nevertheless quite confident that much \nof the recent difficulty with sustaining manufacturing activity that we document is real. We consider \nthese arguments in the concluding section after presenting our empirical results. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nCROSS-SECTIONAL EVIDENCE ON THE IMPORTANCE AND FEASIBILITY OF \n\nATTAINING HIGH MANUFACTURING EMPLOYMENT SHARES \n\nThis section uses cross-sectional data to show a key result of this paper, namely, that there is a strong \npositive  relationship  between  the  maximum  manufacturing  employment  share  that  an  economy \nachieved  in  the  last  40  years  and  its  per  capita  GDP  today.  This  result  does  not  hold  as  strongly  for \nmanufacturing output shares. We also test the three hypotheses motivated in the introduction: (H1) \nmanufacturing  employment  shares  have  declined  over  time,  (H2)  the  income  levels  at  which \nemployment  and  output  shares  peak  have  declined  over  time,  and  (H3)  these  two  trends  are  more \nacute for employment than for output shares. The trends discussed here will be analyzed in detail in \nSections IV and V.  \n\nFigure  1  shows  that  there  is  a  positive  and  statistically  significant  relationship  between \neconomies\u2019  income  per  capita  in  2005\u20132010  and  the  peak  historical  manufacturing  employment \nshare. The relationship with output shares is also positive, but much noisier.  This is our first indication \nthat  manufacturing  employment  is  more  important  than  manufacturing  output  as  a  determinant  of \neventual  prosperity.  Manufacturing  shares  are  calculated  as  7-year  moving  averages  from  1970  to \n2010,  and  the  peak  is  the  highest  of  all  these  moving  averages.  There  are  economies  that  achieved \nshares of over 30%, with Hong Kong, China hitting over 40%; and economies that attained much lower \nshares. \n\n \nRegression 1 in Panel A of Table 2 shows that economies that achieved high peak employment \nshares in the past are richer today. Indeed, controlling for the peak manufacturing employment shares, \npeak manufacturing output shares are statistically insignificant. A 1 percentage point difference in the \npeak  manufacturing  employment  share  is  associated  with  a  final  per  capita  GDP  that  is  13%  higher. \nRegression  2  shows  that  the  slope  of  the  best  fit  line  in  Figure  1  is  statistically  significant,  while \nRegression 3 shows that, on their own, peak manufacturing output shares have very little explanatory \npower (note the much lower R-squared statistic). These regressions suggest that the industrialization \nprocess predicts future prosperity only insofar as it generates manufacturing jobs. Regression 4 adds \nthe  value  of  EXPY  in  the  year  the  employment  share  peaked.  EXPY  is  a  proxy  measure  for  the \nsophistication of an economy\u2019s  export mix calculated using product (not services) data, and known to \nbe a solid predictor of an economy\u2019s subsequent export performance (Hausmann, Hwang, and Rodrik \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n3   Many manufacturing companies are outsourcing non-core operation (e.g., marketing, warehousing, transport, information \ntechnology) and many manufactured products are increasingly bundled with a host of services (e.g., after-sales services, \nsuch as extended warranties, repair services, telephone help-lines). This has been a process where manufacturing firms \nhave  shed  many  of  their  services  functions  to  increase  efficiency.  They  appear  in  the  National  Accounts  as  \u201cproducer \nservices,\u201d  separate  from  manufacturing.  These  outsourced  service  firms  produce  for  manufacturing  firms,  i.e.,  without \nthese  services,  the  products  would  not  reach  consumers.  All  these  services  could  perhaps  be  considered  as  part  of \nmanufacturing.  These  interconnections  between  manufacturing  and  services  are  well  known,  but  are  not  properly \nestimated and accounted for in the statistics.

It shows that peak employment shares have fallen over \ntime, with peaks averaging around 25% and often exceeding 30% until the mid-1980s, averaging 20% \nand rarely crossing 30% until the mid-1990s, and peaks below 20% during the last 15 years.

We \ndo this by asking whether there are thresholds for manufacturing output and employment shares that \ndistinguish rich from non-rich economies. \n \n\nWe  classify  an  economy  as  \u201crich\u201d  if  its  average  per  capita  GDP  during  2005\u20132010  exceeds \nsome  cutoff.  A  cutoff  of  $12,000  in  2005  prices  (not  PPP  corrected)  is  a  convenient  benchmark, \ncorresponding  roughly  to  the  World  Bank\u2019s  definition  of  a  high-income  economy.  Using  this  cutoff, \nexactly half of the 52 economies for which we have employment data are rich.  We will also see what \nhappens  if  we  use  different  cutoffs.  We  will  similarly  propose  that  economies  have  \u201cindustrialized  in \nemployment\u201d  if  their  manufacturing  employment  shares  crossed  a  particular  threshold  at  any  point \nbetween 1970 and 2010. Industrialization in output is defined analogously.  \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\f10   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 420 \n\n \nWe experiment with multiple thresholds for manufacturing shares. For a given income cutoff \nand  threshold  manufacturing  share,  we  will  conclude  that  industrialization  (I)  has  been  necessary  for \nbecoming  rich  (R)  if  we  observe  in  the  data  that  all  rich  economies  industrialized  (i.e.,  no \nindustrialization,  no  high  income;  Pr(R|~I)=0);  and  we  will  say  that  it  is  a  sufficient  condition  if  we \nobserve  that  all  economies  that  have  industrialized  are  rich  (i.e.,  industrialization  guarantees  rich-\ncountry  status;  Pr(R|I)=1).  We  will  also  select,  for  each  income  cutoff,  the  threshold  manufacturing \nshare  that  gives  us  the  most  separation  between  rich  and  non-rich  economies    (i.e.,  the  level  of  I\u2014\nmanufacturing  share,  that  maximizes  \u0394  \u2261  Pr(R|I)  -  Pr(R|~I)).  The  higher  this  difference  is,  the  more \npowerful  the  manufacturing  share  becomes  as  a  predictor  of  eventual  prosperity.  If  crossing  some \nmanufacturing share threshold is both necessary and sufficient for being rich (i.e., Pr(R|I) - Pr(R|~I)=1), \nthe  set  of  industrialized  economies  and  rich  economies  would  coincide,  a  situation  that  would \ncorrespond  to  the  traditional  usage  of  the  term  \u201cindustrialized  nation.\u201d  We  will  examine  these \nrelationships  separately  for  employment-  and  output-based  definitions  of  industrialization.    We \nemphasize  that  we  use  the  terms  \u201cprobability,\u201d  \u201cnecessary,\u201d  and  \u201csufficient\u201d  strictly  to  describe \nhistorical  data,  and  not  as  statements  of  what  is  theoretically  possible.  We  will  return  to  the \nimplications of our results for economies\u2019 future prospects in Section VI. \n\n \nTable  3  shows  Pr(R|I)  in  the  top  panel  and  Pr(R|~I)  in  the  bottom  panel,  calculated  using \nemployment  shares  (using  data  for  52  economies).  The  first  column  in  each  panel  gives  the \npercentage of economies that have reached the income per capita shown in each row (e.g., 57.7% of \nthe  economies  achieved  incomes  over  $6,000).  The  last  row  in  the  top  and  bottom  panels, \nrespectively,  provide  the  percentage  of  economies  that  did  and  did  not  cross  the  threshold \nmanufacturing  share  indicated  in  each  column  (e.g.,  65.4%  of  the  52  economies    reached  a  peak \nmanufacturing  employment  share  of  18%,  and  the  other  34.6%  did  not).    We  have  also  marked  in \nboldface the cells within each row corresponding to the employment threshold that maximizes Pr(R|I) \n-  Pr(R|~I)  for  the  income  level  in  that  row.  For  example,  for  a  per  capita  income  of  $12,000  this \ndifference is maximized at a threshold of 18% (Pr(R|I) - Pr(R|~I)=0.765-0=0.765, which is the largest \ndifference for that income level.  \n\n \nThese  figures  indicate  that  having  crossed  an  18%  employment  threshold  between  1970  and \n2010  is  necessary  for  achieving  $12,000  per  capita  income  today  (Pr(R|~I)=0);  and  having  achieved \nthis share fairly strongly predicts being a rich economy today (Pr(R|I)=0.765<1).  Table 3 indicates that \na 16% threshold is optimal for separating the economies that have and have not crossed $6,000; 18% is \noptimal for $8,000\u2013$22,000; and 20% is optimal for $24,000\u2013$30,000.  In all but one of these cases, \nachieving  the  employment  share  threshold  is  necessary  for  crossing  the  income  cutoff;  no  economy \nthat  failed  to  cross  16%  (18%;  20%)  achieved  a  per  capita  income  of  $6,000  ($8,000\u2013$22,000; \n$24,000\u2013$30,000). Achieving these threshold shares is not sufficient for crossing any income cutoff. \nHowever, the top panel does reveal that 90.9%\u201395.5% of economies that attained 24% manufacturing \nemployment  shares  did  reach  $6,000\u2013$18,000  per  capita  income.  The  takeaway  is,  therefore,  that \npeak  manufacturing  employment  shares  in  excess  of  18%\u201320%  strongly  predict  that  an  economy  is \nrich; while peak shares below this threshold are near perfect predictors that an economy is not rich (i.e., \nmanufacturing employment is necessary for becoming rich). Achieving employment shares of roughly \n18%\u201320% is, therefore, a fairly good definition of industrialization. \n\n \n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\fManufacturing Matters\u2026 but It\u2019s the Jobs that Count   |   11 \n\nTable 3: Probabilities of Being Rich, Conditional on Achieving Manufacturing Employment Share Thresholds \n\nA.

Results indicate that a 22% manufacturing output share achieves maximal separation for \nall income levels (except for $28,000, where 20% fares slightly better). However, the separation is very \npoor.  The  largest  observed  value  for  Pr(R|I)  -  Pr(R|~I)  is  only  0.296,  occurring  at  an  output  share \nthreshold  of  22%  and  an  income  cutoff  of  $6,000.  In  contrast,  for  employment  shares,  the  largest \nobserved  value  is  0.789,  at  an  employment  threshold  of  16%  and  the  same  $6,000  income  cutoff. \nUnsurprisingly, then, the table also shows that industrialization in output is not sufficient to achieve a \nhigh  income  per  capita,  as  no  output  share  cutoff  guarantees  that  an  economy  crosses  any  income \nthreshold; and that it is not necessary either, that is, failure to cross a given output share threshold does \nnot ensure failure to become rich.  \n\n \nWhen we restrict the output sample to the 52 economies for which we have employment data \n(table available on request), the separation improves, but it is still not as good as it is for employment \nshares. The values of Pr(R|I) - Pr(R|~I) now range from 0.41 to 0.59; the result that industrialization in \noutput  is  not  sufficient  to  become  rich  remains;  but  now  we  find  that  industrialization  in  output  is \nnecessary  to  cross  one  income  threshold:  no  economy  with  a  peak  manufacturing  share  of  18%  or \nlower crossed $22,000 per capita income. Compared with the results in Tables 3 and 4, this suggests \nthat output shares are not particularly good predictors of which small economies (many of which lack \nemployment  data)  will  be  rich;  that  output  shares  provide  some  signal  in  the  economies  in  our \nemployment sample; and that employment shares  are much better predictors of eventual prosperity \nthan output shares. \n\n \nHow do the findings in this analysis classify economies? To see this, we return to the $12,000 \ncutoff  for  being  rich  and  separately  pick  employment  and  output  share  thresholds  that  provide \nmaximal  separation  between  rich  and  poor  economies  in  our  52-economy  sample,  that  is,  18%  for \nemployment,  and  22%  for  output.  Table  5  categorizes  economies  by  their  industrialization  status  in \nemployment and output using these thresholds, and highlights the rich economies in bold.  Although \nthe threshold for output shares is higher than the threshold for employment shares, these thresholds \nclassify  exactly  the  same  number  of  economies  (34)  as  industrialized  in  output  and  employment, \nrespectively. This indicates that the horse-race we are about to run between employment and output \nshares is fair. We find that all high-income economies have industrialized in employment, but six high-\nincome  economies  (Canada;  Denmark;  Greece;  Hong  Kong,  China;  Norway;  and  Portugal)  did  not \nindustrialize in output. Indeed, if we restrict attention to those that have industrialized in employment, \nthose that did not industrialize in output are more likely to be rich than those that did (6/7 > 20/27). \nClearly, if we were to select one target, it would be employment shares, not output shares. \n\n \nSumming  up,  this  analysis  indicates  that  achieving  some  critical  output  share  has  generally \nbeen neither necessary nor sufficient for achieving high-income status. On the other hand, achieving a \nmanufacturing employment share of 18%\u201320% has been almost sufficient and absolutely necessary (in \nthe statistical sense) for achieving high-income status. \n\n \n \n\n\f14   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 420 \n\nTable 4: Probabilities of Being Rich, Conditional on Achieving Manufacturing Output Share Thresholds (135 economies)\n \n\nA.

The inverted U-shape is an old idea that goes back to \nthe  pioneering  work  of  Chenery  (1960)  and  Kuznets  (1966),  among  others.  While  Figure  5  confirms \nthis result, Figure 4 is more interesting. Pooling economies and years within decades, we see no general \ntrend for manufacturing employment shares to decline with income, during the 1970s, 1980s or 1990s, \neven at high incomes. However, the concavity of this profile increases with each decade, to the point \nthat  there  is  actually  a  peak  expected  employment  share  by  the  2000s  at  a  per  capita  income  of \naround $13,000. \n \nThe regression lines in Figures 4 and 5 are partly identified of differences between economies. \nThey are not representative of economies\u2019 trajectories over time. For example, the apparently constant \nupward trajectory of manufacturing employment shares with income in the first three decades of our \nsample  might  simply  reflect  the  fact  that  the  original  OECD  economies  were  richer  and  more \nindustrialized  than  the  developing  economies  during  this  period.  In  this  case,  the  results  offer  little \ninsight  into  whether  developing  economies  would  have  been  able  to  continually  increase  their \nmanufacturing shares as they became richer. Therefore, they would not provide the right comparisons \nfor analyzing the structural possibilities that economies have faced, or for testing the three hypotheses \ngenerated  by  the  discussion  in  the  introduction  to  the  paper.  That  task  is  better  accomplished  by \ncomparisons within economies over time.  This requires regressions with country fixed effects.  \n\n \nWe  therefore  estimate \n\nlogarithmic  regressions  of  output  (Y)  and  employment  (L) \n(cid:3014) ) on income per capita (LGDPPC) and income per capita squared as well \nmanufacturing shares ((cid:1838)(cid:1845)(cid:3026),(cid:3013)\nas  a  time  trend  (T),  and  the  interaction  between  the  time  trend  and  income  per  capita.  This \nspecification  embeds  the  three  hypotheses  we  motivated  in  the  introduction.  Specifically,  the  time \ntrend allows us to test whether manufacturing shares, conditional on income levels, have declined over \ntime (H1); and, where the inverted U-shape is confirmed, whether expected peak shares have fallen. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\fManufacturing Matters\u2026 but It\u2019s the Jobs that Count   |   19 \n\nThe  interaction  between  time  and  log  income  per  capita  allows  us  to  test  whether  the  income  per \ncapita at which the manufacturing share peaks has declined over time (H2).  Comparing the results for \nthe employment and output share regressions allows us to test whether these trends are more readily \nobserved  in  employment  than  in  output  shares  (H3).  For  the  reasons  just  explained,  we  introduce \ncountry  fixed  effects,  which  would  reflect,  for  example,  differences  in  geography,  institutions,  and \nhistory.  Some  specifications  also  control  for  population  (LPOP)  and  education  levels  (EDU),  whose \nlevel effects are subsumed in the fixed effects (FE), but whose growth rates vary considerably across \neconomies. Therefore, the regression estimated is:4 \n\n \n(cid:3014) (cid:3404) (cid:1855) (cid:3397) (cid:1853)(cid:2869)(cid:1838)(cid:1833)(cid:1830)(cid:1842)(cid:1842)(cid:1829) (cid:3397) (cid:1853)(cid:2870)(cid:4666)(cid:1838)(cid:1833)(cid:1830)(cid:1842)(cid:1842)(cid:1829)(cid:4667)(cid:2870) (cid:3397) (cid:1853)(cid:2871)(cid:1846) (cid:3397) (cid:1853)(cid:2872)(cid:4666)(cid:1846) \u2217 (cid:1838)(cid:1833)(cid:1830)(cid:1842)(cid:1842)(cid:1829)(cid:4667) (cid:3397) (cid:1853)(cid:2873)(cid:1838)(cid:1842)(cid:1841)(cid:1842) (cid:3397) (cid:1853)(cid:2874)(cid:1831)(cid:1830)(cid:1847) (cid:3397) (cid:3533) (cid:1832)(cid:1831) (cid:3397) (cid:2013)(cid:3047) \n\n(cid:1838)(cid:1845)(cid:3026),(cid:3013)\n\nAcknowledging  the  likely  two-way  causal  relationship  between  contemporary  income  and \nindustrialization levels, and in keeping with the tradition in this literature, we treat the regression results \nas descriptive\u2014they capture the likely joint trajectories of income and manufacturing shares.   \n \nEmployment shares \n \nRegression results for employment shares are shown in Table 6. The coefficients of the linear term are \nall  positive  and  those  of  the  squared  income  term  are  all  negative,  indicating  that  the  employment \nshare  follows  an  inverted  U-shape  with  respect  to  income  per  capita.  To  assess  whether  the \nrelationship slopes up, down, or both over the relevant range of incomes, the table also provides the \nper capita GDP at which the share is estimated to peak in each specification (i.e., the inflection point of \nthe  inverted  U).  Actual  per  capita  incomes  among  our  set  of  135  economies  range  from  $143 \n(Democratic Republic of Congo) to $132,624 (Monaco) in 2010. In the subsample for which we have \nemployment  data,  they  range  from  $524  (Bangladesh)  to  $81,388  (Luxembourg).    The  peak \nmanufacturing employment shares predicted for a \u201ctypical\u201d economy are provided at the bottom.  A \ntypical economy is one with an average intercept term.  When no fixed effects are used, all economies \nare assumed to be \u201ctypical.\u201d \n\n \nRegressions (1)\u2013(4) are introduced to examine the role of fixed effects, and to assess whether \nthe  inverted  U-shape  has  shifted  to  the  left.    The  regression  in  column  (5)  is  our  preferred \nspecification,  because  it  allows  country  fixed  effects,  interactions  between  income  and  time,  and \ncontrols for log population (normalized to have a mean of zero) and its square.  Population growth is \ndriven by many factors other than the structure of production; but, by providing a growing market for \nmanufactured goods, it can exert a strong effect on the size of the industrial sector.  Post-estimation \nresults  indicate  that  larger  populations  are  conducive  to  higher  manufacturing  employment  shares, \nuntil a population level of 182 million. This seems entirely reasonable given that manufacturing is an \nincreasing-returns-to-scale activity that produces tradable goods subject to transport costs (Krugman \n1991). \n\n \nOur  first  major  finding  is  that  country  fixed  effects  matter.

Comparing \n(3)  to  (1)  and  (4)  to  (2),  shows  that  the  per  capita  incomes  at  which  manufacturing  employment  is \nestimated to peak declines enormously when fixed effects are introduced. Thus, today\u2019s industrializing \neconomies should not base their assessments of the feasibility of industrializing in employment on the \nexperiences of earlier industrializers. Such comparisons, which are captured by the regressions without \ncountry fixed effects, are misleading. \n\n \nThe second finding is a clear confirmation of H1, i.e., manufacturing employment shares have \ndeclined  over  time.  This  is  apparent  from  the  decline  in  the  peak  employment  share  expected  by  a \ntypical  economy  as  well  as  the  negative  and  statistically  significant  derivatives  of  the  shares  with \nrespect to the year (not shown\u2014any positive coefficients on the year are more than compensated by \nthe negative coefficients on the interaction between the year and log per capita GDP).   \n\n \nThird, the results also confirm H2, i.e., manufacturing employment peaks at lower levels of per \ncapita income over time.  The coefficient on the interaction between per capita GDP and income is \nnegative  and  highly  significant,  and  (in  regression  5)  the  income  level  of  peak  manufacturing \nemployment fell from $33,994 in 1970, to $9,576 in 2010. Thus, deindustrialization sets in sooner than \nin the past.  \n\n\u00a0\n\n\fManufacturing Matters\u2026 but It\u2019s the Jobs that Count   |   21 \n\nTable 6: Regressions of (Log) Manufacturing Employment Shares over Time and across Economies\n\n(1) \n\n(2) \n\n(3) \n\n(4) \n\n(5) \n\n(6) \n\n-0.012*** \n\n(0.001) \n\n0.047*** \n\n (0.003) \n\n-0.010*** \n\n  (0.001) \n\n0.035*** \n\n (0.004) \n\n0.025*** \n\n (0.006) \n\n0.010 \n\n (0.007) \n\n-0.007*** \n\n(0.000) \n\n-0.005*** \n\n(0.000) \n\n-0.004*** \n\n (0.001) \n\n-0.003*** \n\n (0.001) \n\nLGDPPC squared  \n\n-0.030*** \n\n(0.004) \n\n-0.010** \n\n (0.004) \n\n-0.140*** \n\n  (0.007) \n\n-0.051*** \n\n (0.011) \n\n-0.069*** \n\n (0.013) \n\n-0.082*** \n\n (0.014) \n\n0.681*** \n\n(0.067) \n\n0.470*** \n\n (0.063) \n\n2.529*** \n\n  (0.127) \n\n1.150*** \n\n (0.188) \n\n1.432*** \n\n (0.218) \n\n1.599*** \n\n (0.234) \n\n0.115 \n\n (0.061) \n\n0.038 \n\n (0.057) \n\n-0.023** \n\n (0.008) \n\n-0.012 \n\n (0.008) \n\n0.084*** \n\n (0.009) \n\nConstant \n\n-0.586* \n\n(0.281) \n\n-0.307 \n\n (0.258) \n\n-8.155*** \n\n  (0.616) \n\n-3.034*** \n\n (0.776) \n\n-4.035*** \n\n (0.889) \n\n-4.426*** \n\n (0.954) \n\nNo \n\n1,747 \n\n0.453 \n\nNo \n\n1,747 \n\n0.517 \n\nYes \n\n0.324 \n\n1,747 \n\n0.868 \n\nYes \n\n0.235 \n\n1,747 \n\n0.878 \n\nYes \n\n0.378 \n\n1,747 \n\n0.880 \n\nYes \n\n0.289 \n\n1,654 \n\n0.877 \n\nPer capita GDP at peak (std. error) during: \n\n   Full sample period \n\n$84,758  \n\n($31,369) \n\n$8,437 \n\n($907) \n\n$11.6 billion \n\n$16.4 million \n\n($6.4 \nbillion) \n($49.6 \nmillion) \n\n$23,320 \n\n($14,920) \n\n$75,763 \n\n($55,437) \n\n$33,994 \n\n($15,581) \n\n$17670 \n\n($5,646) \n\n$27,155 \n\n($12,227) \n\n$9,733 \n\n($2,575) \n\n$18,211 \n\n$9,756 \n\n($5,453) \n\n($2,131) \n\n$11,987 \n\n($2,580) \n\n$8,132 \n\n($1,437) \n\nPeak employment share expected by a \"typical\" \n\neconomy in: \n\n26.6% \n\n20.8% \n\n16.3% \n\n(0.74%) \n\n(0.50%) \n\n(0.43%) \n\n169.9% \n\n(142.01%) \n\n31.1% \n\n13.6% \n\n(7.46%) \n\n(5.25%) \n\n26.5% \n\n21.9% \n\n18.1% \n\n(0.48%) \n\n(0.28%) \n\n(0.34%) \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n30.8% \n\n20.1% \n\n14.6% \n\n  \n\n(3.35%) \n\n(0.66%) \n\n(0.38%) \n\n31.0% \n\n21.6% \n\n15.9% \n\n(1.90%) \n\n(0.79%) \n\n(0.82%) \n\n31.0% \n\n20.4% \n\n13.8% \n\n(1.19%) \n\n(0.73%) \n\n(0.73%) \n\nNotes: *, **, and *** capture significance at the 5%, 1%, and 0.1% levels, respectively.

The  fixed  effects,  correcting  for  income  and  population, \nshow  whether  a  nation  \u201cpunches  above  its  weight\u201d  in  sustaining  manufacturing  employment  shares. \nThe table also includes the median year of peak industrialization in each group of economies, and the \npopulation-weighted  average  of  the  country  fixed  effects.    The  dates  show  that  manufacturing \nemployment  typically  peaked  earliest  in  high-income  economies,  followed  by  Latin  American  and \nCaribbean  (LAC)  nations,  while  Asia  is  peaking  late.  The  fixed  effects  reveal  that,  on  average,  Asian \neconomies  have  sustained  higher  manufacturing  employment  shares  than  \u201cexpected,\u201d  while  high- \nincome  and  Latin  American  and  Caribbean  economies  have  typically  sustained  lower  shares.  These \nregional  comparisons  are  the  exact  inverse  of  what  we  would  have  expected  if  the  date  of \nindustrialization  had  been  the  only  factor  determining  the  manufacturing  share  that  could  be \nsustained.  If  that  were  the  case,  Asian  economies,  being  late  industrializers,  should  be  at  a  relative \ndisadvantage.  This  suggests  that  there  is  indeed  something  different  about  Asian  economies  that \npermitted  them  to  sustain  high  levels  of  manufacturing  employment.  Policy  differences  are  one \npossibility. \n\n \nOne relatively easy-to-quantify possibility, given the East Asian experience, is education.  To \nexamine  this,  regression  (6)  in  Table  6  adds  a  correction  for  years  of  schooling,  which  also  enters \npositively, indicating that an educated population is helpful for sustaining manufacturing employment. \nConsistent  with  this,  the  unexplained  inter-country  variation  in  manufacturing  employment  shares \n(the  standard  deviation  of  the  fixed  effects)  falls  significantly  when  education  is  introduced  as  an \nexplanatory variable. \n\nindustrialization  we  derived  earlier  (i.e.,  that \n\n \nThe fixed-effects regressions in Table 6 (regressions 4\u20136) show that the maximum expected \nemployment share for a typical economy has fallen to around 13%\u201316%. Together with the empirical \ndefinition  of \nindustrialized  economies  achieved \nmanufacturing employment shares in excess of 18%\u201320%, a level that almost every now-rich country \nachieved at some point), this suggests that the path to prosperity through manufacturing employment \nmay have become more difficult. \n \nOutput shares \n \nTable 8 presents the analogous  regressions for output shares (with 135 economies). Results confirm \nthe  importance  of  including  fixed  effects  in  the  analyses  of  possible  manufacturing  output  shares\u2014\nfixed  effects  have  high  explanatory  power  and  reduce  the  per  capita  GDP  at  which  manufacturing \noutput shares are estimated to peak by roughly an order of magnitude. This is qualitatively similar to \nthe behavior of employment shares. Also, as with employment, large output shares are easier to sustain \nin more educated and populous economies. \n \n\nHowever, there are major differences between the behavior of employment and output shares. \nRegardless of whether country fixed effects are included or not, deindustrialization in output sets in at \na  lower  income  (roughly  $2,000)  than  does  deindustrialization  in  employment.  This  may  reflect  the \neffects  of  Cost  Disease  (Baumol  2012),  wherein  higher  incomes  are  accompanied  by  higher \nmanufacturing labor productivity, and services that become expensive relative to manufactured goods.  \nThis further reduces the gradient of manufacturing output shares with respect to incomes.   \n\n \n\n\fTable 7: Country Fixed Effects (Employment Share Regression 5) and Year of Peak Manufacturing Employment \n\nEconomy/Region \n\nFixed \nEffect \n\nPeak \nDate \n\nEconomy/Region \n\nHigh-income economies \n\n-0.032 \n\nLatin America and Caribbean \n\nManufacturing Matters\u2026 but It\u2019s the Jobs that Count   |   23 \n\nEconomy/Region \n\nAsia \n\nBangladesh \n\nChina, People's Republic of \n\n-0.424 \n\n1988 \n\nHong Kong, China \n\nFixed \nEffect \n\n-0.031 \n\n-0.170 \n\n-0.117 \n\n-0.179 \n\n-0.434 \n\n0.099 \n\n0.202 \n\n0.128 \n\n0.216 \n\n-0.205 \n\n-0.309 \n\n-0.385 \n\n-0.117 \n\n-0.083 \n\n-0.353 \n\nPeak \nDate \n\n1989 \n\n1970 \n\n2010 \n\n1971 \n\n1993 \n\n1991 \n\n1992 \n\n1994 \n\n1997 \n\n1989 \n\n1996 \n\n1971 \n\n1970 \n\n1978 \n\n1985 \n\nKorea, Republic of \n\nIndia \n\nIndonesia \n\nMalaysia \n\nPakistan \n\nPhilippines \n\nSingapore \n\nThailand \n\nOther \n\nBotswana \n\nPoland \n\nRomania \n\nSyrian Arab Republic \n\nFixed \nEffect \n\n0.096 \n\n0.238 \n\n0.129 \n\n0.220 \n\n0.259 \n\n-0.130 \n\n-0.017 \n\n0.052 \n\n0.230 \n\n-0.308 \n\n0.386 \n\nPeak \nDate \n\n1992 \n\n1992 \n\n2010 \n\n1974 \n\n1999 \n\n2000 \n\n1989 \n\n1995 \n\n1979 \n\n1973 \n\n1981 \n\n-0.342 \n\n2004 \n\n0.003 \n\n1984 \n\n-0.425 \n\n0.108 \n\n0.372 \n\n0.083 \n\n1996 \n\n1978 \n\n1986 \n\n1982 \n\nAustralia \n\nAustria \n\nBelgium \n\nCanada \n\nDenmark \n\nFinland \n\nFrance \n\nGreece \n\nIreland \n\nItaly \n\nJapan \n\nLuxembourg \n\nNetherlands \n\nNorway \n\nPortugal \n\nPuerto Rico \n\nSan Marino \n\nSpain \n\nSweden \n\nSwitzerland \n\nUnited Kingdom \n\nUnited States \n\nArgentina \n\nBolivia \n\nBrazil \n\nChile \n\nColombia \n\nCosta Rica \n\nEl Salvador \n\nGuatemala \n\nHonduras \n\nMexico \n\nPanama \n\nPeru \n\nSuriname \n\n-0.321 \n\n0.251 \n\n0.062 \n\n-0.328 \n\n0.089 \n\n0.152 \n\n-0.135 \n\n-0.182 \n\n0.080 \n\n-0.010 \n\n-0.064 \n\n0.658 \n\n-0.178 \n\n-0.041 \n\n0.146 \n\n-0.078 \n\n2.247 \n\n-0.098 \n\n0.043 \n\n0.214 \n\n-0.109 \n\n-0.325 \n\n1971 \n\n1970 \n\n1974 \n\n1970 \n\n1970 \n\n1970 \n\n1977 \n\n1971 \n\n1989 \n\n1977 \n\n1977 \n\n1971 \n\n1971 \n\n1970 \n\n1972 \n\n1971 \n\n1976 \n\n1978 \n\n1970 \n\n1972 \n\n1970 \n\n1970 \n\n1970 \n\nTrinidad and Tobago \n\nVenezuela, Bolivarian Republic of \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nNote: We provide median dates of peak manufacturing employment share (unweighted) in each region, and population-weighted average fixed effects for each region.  \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n \n\n \n\n\f24   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 420 \n\nTable 8: Regressions of (Log) Manufacturing Output Shares over Time and across Economies\n\n(1) \n\n(2) \n\n(3) \n\n(4) \n\n(5) \n\n(6) \n\nYear \n\n-0.012*** \n\n(0.001) \n\n-0.002** \n\n (0.001) \n\n-0.005* \n\n (0.003) \n\n-0.004 \n\n-0.001 \n\n (0.003) \n\n(0.001) \n\n0.001 \n\n(0.000) \n\n-0.013*** \n\n0.001 \n\n(0.003) \n\n(0.000) \n\n-0.009** \n\n(0.003) \n\n-0.000 \n\n(0.000) \n\nLog GDP per capita (LGDPPC) \n\n0.774*** \n\n(0.050) \n\n0.775*** \n\n (0.050) \n\n1.537*** \n\n(0.090) \n\n1.604*** \n\n (0.120) \n\n1.490*** \n\n(0.124) \n\n1.639*** \n\n  (0.119) \n\n-0.042*** \n\n(0.003) \n\n-0.042*** \n\n(0.003) \n\n-0.103*** \n\n(0.007) \n\n-0.109*** \n\n (0.010) \n\n-0.098*** \n\n (0.010) \n\n-0.107*** \n\n(0.009) \n\nLog GDP per capita x Year \n\nLGDPPC squared  \n\nLog population \n\nLog population squared \n\nYears of schooling (Population aged 15+) \n\n0.352*** \n\n (0.066) \n\n0.284*** \n\n(0.049) \n\n-0.027*** \n\n (0.006) \n\n-0.026*** \n\n (0.006) \n\n0.022** \n\n (0.008) \n\nConstant \n\n-0.646*** \n\n(0.197) \n\n-0.674*** \n\n  (0.197) \n\n-2.791*** \n\n  (0.311) \n\n-2.956*** \n\n (0.367) \n\n-2.55*** \n\n  (0.367) \n\n-3.230*** \n\n (0.386) \n\nCountry fixed effects?

The  resulting  decline  of  employment  shares \nrelative to output shares is exactly what we would expect to see if rates of labor-saving technological \nchange have been higher in manufacturing than  in  the rest  of the economy. With respect to H2, we \nlikewise find that the per capita income at which output shares peak has not decreased significantly. \nThis,  in  combination  with  the  fact  that  the  income  level  at  which  manufacturing  employment  peaks \nhas  fallen,  is  consistent  with  the  possibility  that  economies  substituted  capital-intensive  for  labor-\nintensive  manufacturing  activities  as  incomes  rose.  Together,  these  results  confirm  that  sustaining \nmanufacturing  output  is  becoming  somewhat  more  difficult,  and  that  rising  incomes  do  not  weigh \nheavily  on  the  output  levels  that  economies  can  sustain.  The  real  problem  economies  face  is  with \nsustaining manufacturing employment. Thus, they confirm H3.    \n \n \n\nVI.  \n\nINTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS \n\n \nWe  have  explored  thoroughly  the  relationships  between  economic  prosperity  and  manufacturing \noutput and employment shares. We have shown that all economies that are rich today have, at some \npoint in the last 40 years, enjoyed high manufacturing employment shares; while only a few economies \nthat  attained  high  manufacturing  employment  shares  are  not  rich  economies.  Manufacturing \nemployment  has  therefore  been,  as  a  matter  of  historical  record,  necessary  but  not  sufficient  for \neventual  prosperity.  This  is  quite  consistent  with  two  points  demonstrated  by  Rodrik  (2013a).  First, \nthat  economies  that  create  many  manufacturing  jobs  grow  faster  because  manufacturing  has  an \n\u201cescalator\u201d  quality\u2014labor  productivity  in  manufacturing  industries  rises  rapidly  towards  the  global \nfrontier.  Second,  this  is  insufficient  to  ensure  that  poorer  economies  will  grow  faster  than  richer \neconomies because manufacturing constitutes a relatively small share of total employment. \n \n\nOur  second  contribution  is  to  show  that  manufacturing  employment  shares  have  fallen,  and \nnow go into decline at lower levels of per capita income than they once did.  Therefore, the fraction of \nnational workforces for which manufacturing serves as an escalator has declined, even in low-income \neconomies.  Once again, manufacturing output shares do not display these trends as strongly. Taken \nliterally, these results would appear to highlight the maintenance of manufacturing employment as one \nof the most important and difficult challenges that developing economies face today. \n\n \nOf course, these results cannot be taken literally without a clear understanding of the causal \nmechanisms that drive them. We have shown that the data are consistent with explanations involving \ntwo  forces:  rising  own-price  elasticities  of  manufacturing  labor  demand,  and  labor  productivity  that \nrises  faster  in  manufacturing  than  in  non-manufacturing  activities.    However,  two  other  alternative \nexplanations need to be considered.  \n\n \nOne is that, the result is purely mechanical. Suppose, in contrast to our story, that global labor \nproductivity in manufacturing and in other sectors grew at the same pace, and that the growth rates of \nmanufacturing  outputs  and  of  other  products  were  identical.  It  follows  that  global  manufacturing \nemployment  shares  would  have  remained  constant.5  In  this  case,  recent  small  increases  in  national \nmanufacturing  employment  shares  in  some  populous  developing  economies  (e.g.,  the  PRC,  India) \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n5   Aggregating across developing economies, Haraguchi (2014) finds that: (i) manufacturing\u2019s share in total output (added \nup across economies) has not changed since the 1970s, hovering around 20%\u201323%; and (ii) the aggregate manufacturing \nemployment share increased since 1970. \n\n\f26   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 420 \n\nwould  have  to  be  accompanied  by  large  declines  in  the  corresponding  shares  in  economies  with \nsmaller populations. While we are confident that the large populations of recent industrializers are part \nof  the  story,  the  relatively  small  movements  in  manufacturing  output  shares  are  not  consistent  with \nthis purely mechanical explanation.  If our results for employment shares were entirely driven by the \nSouthward  migration  of  manufacturing  activity,  output  shares  should  have  moved  along  with \nemployment shares. \n\n \nAnother  possibility \n\nincreased  outsourcing  of \nis  that,  we  are  simply  capturing  the \nmanufacturing-related services activity to dedicated service companies.6 Again, it seems likely that this \nexplains  part  of  the  declines  in  measured  manufacturing  shares,  but  not  all  of  them.    After  all,  this \nclassification  problem  should  afflict  manufacturing  output  shares  as  well,  and  yet,  these  have  not \nshifted  downwards  very  fast,  or  leftwards  at  all.  Finally,  it  is  worth  noting  that  if  we  add  UNIDO\u2019s \n(2013)  estimate  of  outsourced  or  manufacturing-related \njobs  to  our  figures,  manufacturing \nemployment  shares  would  increase  by  around  20%.  If  we  apply  this  increase  to  developing  and \ndeveloped economies alike, many low and middle-income economies would still fail to reach the 18%\u2013\n20%  manufacturing  employment  share  threshold  (e.g.,  Bangladesh,  Indonesia,  the  Philippines,  and \nmost economies in the Middle East and North Africa, Central Asia, and Central America). \n\n \nTwo final comments, offered in closing. First, why is it that manufacturing employment shares \nhave  much  clearer  relationships  with  concurrent  and  subsequent  income  levels  than  output  shares? \nOne  possibility  is  that  output  shares  are  influenced  by  the  price  of  manufactured  relative  to  non-\nmanufactured outputs, which vary with incomes and across economies. We have already argued that \nthese  relative  price  differences  may  explain  why  output  shares  peak  at  lower  incomes  than \nemployment shares. Variations in this relative price may also confound efforts to identify relationships \nwith output shares.   \n\n \nSecond,  with  the  scope  for  manufacturing  growth  limited  by  the  structural  forces  we  have \nidentified as well as by the increasing awareness of the high carbon footprint of many industries, and \nthe  possibility  of  restrictions  on  carbon  emissions  to  avoid  the  negative  effects  of  climate  change \n(Gutowski  2007,  Stern  2007),  we  need  to  consider  whether  economies  can  get  rich  by  shifting  to \nservices without achieving high manufacturing employment  shares. While it is impossible to rule out \nthis  possibility  (given  the  growing  array  of  new  services  and  service-delivery  modes,  some  of  which \nappear  to  have  rather  high  economies  of  scale  (e.g.,  Maroto-S\u00e1nchez  and  Cuadrado-Roura  2009), \nSection IV demonstrates there are not yet any examples of economies that have done so successfully. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n6   UNIDO  (2013)  reckons  that  manufacturing  employment  is  underestimated  because  informal  manufacturing  jobs  and \njobs  in  manufacturing-related  services  are  not  properly  counted.  UNIDO  has  estimated  the  latter  worldwide  for  1970\u2013\n2009. In 2009, the number of these jobs was 95 million, or almost half of the direct formal jobs globally in manufacturing, \nand that 32 million of these jobs were in developed economies. We have spoken with UNIDO staff about how these jobs \nwere estimated and their reliability. UNIDO has advised that their estimates are a first approximation that can certainly be \nused, but with great caution. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\f\u00a0\n\nAPPENDIX A: EMPLOYMENT DATA \n\n \nThe cleaning of the ILO\u2019s LABORSTA data proceeded as follows. We began with the full LABORSTA \ndatabase.  In  any  given  economy  and  year,  these  data  can  include  estimates  from  more  than  one \nsource,  and  the  sources  may  use  different  sectoral  classifications.  From  this,  we  kept  observations \ncollected  according  to  the  International  Standard  Industrial  Classification,  versions  2,  3,  or  4,  and \ndropped the others. We then dropped sources that exclude major sections of the workforce (e.g., rural \nresidents,  agricultural  workers).  In  those  instances  where  employment  levels  in  some  sectors  were \nmissing, but could be inferred from total employment and employment in other sectors, we filled in the \nblanks  and  checked  to  see  whether  this  yielded  discontinuities  in  the  series.  Where  discontinuities \nwere observed, the series corresponding to that economy and source were dropped.   \n \n\nAfter these adjustments, some economies still  had multiple sources in some years. For these \neconomy-year pairs with overlapping series, we opted to use the longest continuous series.  When the \nseries had the same length, we chose the one that used ISIC revision 2. The final series were checked \ngraphically for anomalies. \n\n \n\nLABORSTA only \n\nTable A.1: List of Economies by Source\n \n\nBangladesh, Botswana, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Pakistan,

income.  The \ndata  in  Figure  B1  are  raw.  They  have  not  been  corrected  for  exogenous  determinants.    While  an \ninverted  U-shape  is  observed  for  non-small  island  nations  in  both  time  periods,  no  evidence  of  an \ninverted  U-shape  appears  for  small  island  nations  in  the  latter  20  years  of  our  sample.    Small  island \nnations  are  also  clearly  different,  in  that  they  have  lower  manufacturing  output  shares  than  other \neconomies. \n \n\nFigure B1: All Economies, Split by Small Island, No Corrections \n \n\n1970\u20131990 \n\n1991-2010 \n\n\u00a0\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n \n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n10\n\n12\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\nlgdppc\n\n8\nlgdppc\n\n10\n\n12\n\n \n\nNotes: Green dots are island nations. Blue dots are non-island nations. \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n\n \n\nNext, to examine these structural issues further, we regressed the output shares on the year, \nyear-squared,  and  several  structural  features.  These  are:  natural  resource  exports  as  a  share  of  total \nexports  in  1990,  log  population,  log  per  capita  land  endowment,  the  share  of  land  that  is  usable  for \nagriculture,  and  the  ratios  of  retirees  and  young  people  to  the  working-age  population.  Results  are \navailable on request. The key differences between small island nations and other nations are: (i) small \nisland  nations  have  a  lower  intercept  (smaller  manufacturing  shares,  other  things  equal),  suggesting \nthat  manufacturing  activity  is  hard  to  sustain  in  more  remote  economies;  and  (ii)  while  natural \nresource  intensity  reduces  manufacturing  output  in  other  nations,  it  increases  it  in  islands,  again \nsuggesting  that  island  nations  without  natural  resources  of  their  own  find  it  difficult  to  sustain \nmanufacturing. \n \nFinally, figure B2 graphs the residuals from these regressions against log per capita GDP.  With \nthese corrections for underlying structural features firmly in place, we now see much clearer evidence \nof an inverted U with respect to per capita income for island nations. All these results suggest that per \ncapita GDP has been a relatively less important determinant of manufacturing output shares in island \nnations,  but  that  structural  factors  have  been  relatively  important.    To  avoid  complications,  we \ntherefore do not include them in our analysis. \n\n\f32   |   Appendix B: Differences Between Small Island Nations and Other Nations \n\nFigure B2: All Economies, Split by Small Island, Structural Corrections \n\n1970\u20131990\n\n1991\u20132010\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n \n\n4\n\n6\n\n10\n\n12\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\nlgdppc\n\n8\nlgdppc\n\n10\n\n12\n\n \n\nNotes: Green dots are island nations.

Sustaining Employment Growth: The Role of Manufacturing and Structural Change. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\fManufacturing Matters\u2026 but It\u2019s the Jobs That Count\n\nPractically every economy that enjoys a high income today experienced a manufacturing employment \nshare in excess of 18%\u201320% sometime since the 1970s. Manufacturing output share thresholds are much \npoorer predictors of rich-country status. We also find that the maximum expected employment share for a \ntypical economy has fallen to around 13%\u201315%. Industrialization in employment has been more important \nfor eventual prosperity than industrialization in output; and high manufacturing employment shares are \nbecoming more difficult to sustain as incomes rise. Our findings suggest that the path to prosperity through \nindustrialization may have become more difficult. \n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member \ncountries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, \nit remains home to approximately two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: 1.6 billion people who live on less than $2 \na day, with 733 million struggling on less than $1.25 a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through \ninclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for \nhelping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, \nand technical assistance.\n\nMAnufACTurIng \n\nMATTers\u2026 BuT IT\u2019s The \n\nJoBs ThAT CounT\n\nJesus Felipe, Aashish Mehta, and Changyong Rhee\n\nno. 420\n\nnovember 2014\n\nadb economics\n\nworking paper series\n\nAsiAn Development BAnk\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["\u00a0\n", "ADB Economics Working Paper Series \n", " \n  \nManufacturing Matters\u2026 but It\u2019s the Jobs That Count \n \n \nJesus Felipe, Aashish Mehta, \nand Changyong Rhee \n", " \n", "No. 420   |   2014 \n", "Jesus Felipe (jfelipe@adb.org) is Advisor in the \nEconomics and Research Department of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank.
