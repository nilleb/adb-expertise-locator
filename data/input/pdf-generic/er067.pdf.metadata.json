Introduction\nThe seminal study by Kuznets (1955) that sought to establish the efficacy of economic\ngrowth in improving income distribution has spawned an extensive literature. Subsequent\nstudies by Ahluwalia (1976), Saith (1983), Papanek and Kyn (1986), Ram (1988), Anand and\nKanbur (1993), Campano and Salvatore (1988), and Deininger and Squire (1998) have tried\nto identify whether a tradeoff between economic growth and inequality exists. These studies\nindicate limited support for the Kuznets hypothesis, which states that countries on a growth\npath from a low level of income to an intermediate level of income will incur a worsen-\ning distribution of income, and that on the growth path from the intermediate level of income\ntoward the high level of income, the distribution of income improves. The results emanating\nfrom these studies are sensitive to sample choice and proxy for income distribution.\nRecent studies on income distribution and endogenous growth by Alesina and Rodrik\n(1991), Alesina and Perotti (1993), Bertola (1991), Perotti (1993), Persson and Tabellini (1994),\nand Saint-Paul and Verdier (1991) return to the aforementioned debate. First, the new litera-\nture looks at the impact of inequality on growth rather than the reverse, as was the case\nwith the earlier literature influenced by Kuznets (1955). Second, the interaction between\nincome distribution, economic growth, and fiscal policy is traced over time. Third, the critical\nlink between income distribution and growth is provided by the theory of public choice\nand in particular the median voter theorem. The impact of income distribution on growth\nis viewed as being mediated through a political process. Taking their market income as a\nstarting point, voters assess their estimated benefits and losses from redistribution, and vote\non redistribution policy. In this way redistribution can affect economic growth.1\nDifferences in public policies are one possible explanation for differences in coun-\ntries\u2019 economic growth rates. It is reasonable to assume that if incentives to accumulate capital\nare low (e.g. under conditions of financial repression or excessive taxation), private own-\nership of capital is banned, or legal titles are unclear, people will not invest as much as they\nwould otherwise. If growth is related to investment, growth will be slower. However, public\npolicy itself is the outcome of interests and political strengths of different social groups and\nindividuals. One key difference between people is their ownership of assets and amounts\nof income they receive. Income inequality thus enters in the determination of policy (prin-\ncipally, in decisions on taxation and public expenditures).\nThe aforementioned studies model the public sector as financing public investment\nin production services, public investment in education, or redistribution through propor-\ntional taxation. The models have the appealing feature of incorporating political processes\nand economic structures. Political processes capture the way that individual preferences over\nfiscal policy are translated into macroeconomic policy. The economic structure illuminates\nthe link between fiscal policy and economic growth.\n1There is also a literature linking income distribution to economic growth through credit market\nimperfections. For a comprehensive survey of this literature see Perotti (1994). We do not consider this class\nof models in this study.", "2\nConsider the situation of an extremely skewed distribution of market income and\nwhere all adults of eligible age are allowed to vote (full franchise).2 In such a system, the\nmedian voter is relatively poor (his income is not much higher than the income of indi-\nviduals belonging to the lowest decile) and has an interest to vote for extensive redistribution.\nIf this happens, returns on assets owned by the rich will be lowered and the incentives for\ntheir accumulation reduced. This, in turn, may have a negative impact on growth. If this\nrelation is valid at all levels of income, as Persson and Tabellini (1994) assume, income\ninequality will have a negative impact on growth. In empirical terms, it would be unlikely\nto find the constellation of highly unequal income distribution, full democracy, and fast\ngrowth. This constellation is even more unlikely to occur at low levels of absolute income.\nAlesina and Rodrik (1991) similarly hold that higher inequality, reflected in individu-\nals\u2019 capital\u2013labor ratios that are highly skewed to the right, will be bad for growth. If\ncapital\u2013labor ratios are highly skewed to the right (a proxy for high income inequality),\nthe median voter will choose a tax on capital that is higher than the tax compatible with\nthe highest growth rate, because the median voter\u2019s gain from a proportional tax on capital\nwill be greater than the tax he must pay. In other words, the median voter will have suf-\nficiently little capital that the tax he pays will be small compared to the gain that he receives\nthrough government transfers financed out of the capital tax.\nHowever, if government transfers themselves are favorable for growth (e.g., higher\neducation expenditures) the nature of the relationship changes somewhat. At the extreme,\nthe positive impact of transfers on growth may more than offset the negative impact of taxes\nand the relationship between high inequality and high redistribution (on the one hand) and\nhigh growth (on the other) may turn out to be positive. This is the point made by Saint-\nPaul and Verdier (1991).\nIn the model proposed by Perotti (1993) the relationship between inequality and\ngrowth is not monotonic. His model also generates endogenously the well-known Kuznets\nrelationship. The Kuznets inverted U curve states that income inequality increases at low\nlevels of per capita income as both physical and human capital are scarce, unequally dis-\ntributed, and command high returns. As human and physical capital accumulate, the rate\nof return on both declines and the pool of people who have such capital increases. Income\ndistribution becomes more equal.\nTo sum up, there is a link between incentives to accumulate productive assets (in-\ncluding education) and growth. The long-term growth rate of an economy can be viewed\nas being determined by the incentives to accumulate human and physical capital, i.e., rates\nof return on each, the extent of redistribution (which drives the wedge between the mar-\nket and actual return appropriated by the economic agents), and the use to which the\ngovernment puts the resources it receives from taxes. The extent of redistribution, in turn,\nis determined by inequality of income distribution (positively), the type of political regime\nin place (democracy versus authoritarian in very broad terms), degree of political partici-\npation of the poor in the political process (positively), and the level of development.\nEmpirical studies by Alesina and Rodrik (1991), Alesina and Perotti (1993), and\nPersson and Tabellini (1994) link initial income distribution to economic growth through\ntransfers or productive government spending. However, no attempt has been made to discern\nthe connection of initial income distribution to the evolution of future income distribution\n2Market income is income that is received before any taxation or government transfers.", "3\nthrough the fiscal channel. This is surprising since the theoretical models of Perroti (1993)\nand Saint-Paul and Verdier (1991) illuminate the evolution of income distribution and eco-\nnomic growth.\nMost empirical studies to date have used the cross-country regression framework.\nSome of the theoretical propositions, however, are related to the time series evolution of\neconomies. While the growth literature has mostly used the cross-country regression frame-\nwork to make intertemporal inferences, very strict assumptions on model specification have\nto be made in order for this approach to be valid.3\nThis study seeks to address two issues. First, it links initial income distribution and\npolitical regimes to the evolution of economic growth and income distribution through fiscal\npolicy. Second, it identifies what type of fiscal policy low-income economies should imple-\nment in order to achieve sustainable economic growth and move to high level of per capita\nincome. Fiscal policy consists of transfer payments or an income tax. Fiscal policy is de-\ntermined by the level of development, distribution of income, and degree of political\nfranchise. Reduced form equations are obtained from the political equilibrium endogenous\ngrowth models addressing distributional issues. Empirical tests of these reduced form\nequations are carried out by using cross-country data, as well as time series data from India\nand Taipei,China. Time series regressions for India and Taipei,China are conducted to capture\nthe intertemporal inferences made by the theoretical models. India and Taipei,China are\nchosen for the country studies because of the availability of income distribution data over\na span of 30 years.\nThe cross-country evidence suggests that lagged income distribution is linked to future\neconomic growth and income distribution through transfer payments. Time series evidence\nfrom Taipei,China suggests that low-income economies may have to implement low lev-\nels of direct taxes, which is accompanied by a worsening distribution of income, in order\nto promote economic growth\nThe second section presents the theoretical model underlying the regression. Empirical\ntests are presented in the third section, and the fourth section contains the conclusion.\nII. The Model\nThe theoretical model underlying the regressions is presented. Perotti\u2019s (1993) model\nis used because of its thorough description of the interactions over time between redistribu-\ntive fiscal policy, income distribution, and economic growth. His model also has the unique\nfeature of generating the Kuznets curve, which plots the intertemporal variation in income\ndistribution. This is very appealing from an empirical point of view, since studies by\nCampano and Salvatore (1988), Jha (1996), and Ram (1988), find evidence for the existence\nof the Kuznets curve based on cross-country data. Alesina and Rodrik (1991) and Persson\nand Tabellini (1994) give no insight on the evolution of income distribution. In their model\nincome distribution remains fixed over time. Saint-Paul and Verdier\u2019s (1991) study has the\nresult that the distribution of income converges to perfect equality in the steady state. Both\n3The basic assumption underlying cross-country regressions is that the relationship to be estimated\nis time and space invariant. Technically the following equation has to hold  y = f(X )+\u00b5 . If the function\nit it it\nf(X ) is not independent of time and space, the cross country regression framework is inappropriate for making\nit\nintertemporal inferences. See Heerink (1994) for a full discussion of this issue.", "4\nof these features do not match the existing cross-country or time series observations on\nincome distribution.\nIn Perotti\u2019s two-period model, the economy consists of three groups of agents i\nbelonging to income class h, m, or l. There is no capital market, uncertainty, and discounting.\nPreferences are represented by a linear utility function. In the first period, agents decide\nwhether to invest in education or not, how much to consume, and the income tax rate. The\ncost of education is normalized to 1. Taxes, T, are proportional to pretax income. The revenue\nfrom taxation is redistributed as a per capita subsidy, which is constant across individu-\nals. The government budget is always balanced. There are costs to collecting taxes. Suppose\nn  represents per capita income in period 1. Tn  is the amount of taxes collected, while\n1 1\nindividuals receive a subsidy net of collection costs an amount n (T-T2).\n1\nThe model generates the following results.\nAt a very low level of per capita income, the median voter will not vote for a high\nlevel of redistribution since the resulting income distribution will not allow anybody to\naccumulate significant amounts of human capital. The economy will be stuck in a poverty\ntrap. For growth to occur, the median voter will have to be relatively close to the high income\ngroups in order to favor low levels of redistribution. Redistribution is thus less, the rich\nare able to accumulate capital, and the society\u2019s income grows. The distribution of income\nworsens. The two conditions that promote growth in a poor society are: the median voter\nmust not be too poor to favor high redistribution, and the rich must be sufficiently rich to\nbe able to accumulate capital.\nIn rich societies, the situation changes. The key requirement is larger redistribution.\nThe growth rate will be higher the more widely spread is education. This requires that even\nthe poor are able to invest in education, which, in turn, requires sizable redistribution.\nSufficient redistribution will occur only if the median voter is now relatively close to the\npoor, and if the poor are not so destitute that no amount of redistribution will allow them\nto invest in education. At each level of income, the political process needs to deliver the\nright amount of redistribution to promote growth. At low levels of income, growth will\nproceed only if inequality is substantial. But at some sufficiently high income levels, the\nsociety will fail to grow unless investment in education pervades most or all income groups\nand income inequality declines.\nIn a cross section of countries we can make the following propositions, based on the\nmodel\u2019s results.\n(1) Countries with low and intermediate levels of income will have low levels\nof redistribution. Countries whose incomes exceed the intermediate levels of\nincome will have high levels of redistribution, of which the high-income econo-\nmies will have the largest levels of redistribution. Hence in a cross section of\ncountries we should observe a convex relationship between redistributive fiscal\nvariables and level of per capita GDP. This U curve relationship traces the\noptimal fiscal policy at each level of per capita GDP necessary for ongoing\ngrowth. We therefore expect a positive sign on the coefficient for the fiscal\nvariable in the growth regression if the U curve relationship exists.\n(2) An increase in the share of the median income group (proxied by the sum\nof the third and fourth quintiles), for a given level of democracy, leads to a\ndecrease in redistribution.", "5\nWe expect the following empirical regularities based on time series observations from\nIndia and Taipei,China.\n(3) Countries starting at a low level of income, which have continued to be\nplagued by low levels of income across time (India) have increasing levels of\nredistribution. The effect of an increase in redistribution in these countries is\nlow economic growth accompanied by an improving income distribution.\n(4) Countries that started at a low level of income, but have moved up to the\nintermediate level of income across time (Taipei,China) have decreasing levels\nof redistribution. As redistribution decreases in these countries, economic\ngrowth should increase, accompanied by a worsening distribution of income.\nIII. Empirical Tests\nFiscal policy is approximated either by the tax/GDP ratio or transfers/GDP ratio.\nFiscal policy may be determined by the type of political regime in existence (democracy,\nleft wing, or right-wing authoritarianism) and the level of income inequality. According to\nthe model discussed in the previous section, the poor will vote for taxation and govern-\nment spending because they expect to gain therefrom.4 However, income inequality has to\nbe \u201cfiltered\u201d through the political regime in order to determine fiscal policy.\nThe evolution of the distribution of income is determined by the level of per capita\nincome and fiscal policy. In low-income economies, an increase in redistribution may worsen\nthe postfiscal distribution of income, while in intermediate and high-income economies, an\nincrease in redistribution may improve the postfiscal distribution of income.\nAn explanation for changes in growth performance is posited by looking at growth\nrates over the sample period. The growth rate during this period is determined by fiscal\npolicy, which is an endogenous variable in this case, and a set of control variables. The control\nvariables include political stability, investment/GDP ratio, level of secondary education,\nbureaucratic efficiency, initial capital stock, and population growth.\nA. Cross-country Regressions\nThe proxy for current income distribution is the Gini coefficient in the late 1980s to\nearly 1990s (Gini ).5 The median voter\u2019s position within the income distribution is repre-\ni,t\nsented by the share of national income of the third and fourth quintiles of the population\naround 1960 (Mid). For the developing countries, we use the data set compiled by Chen,\nDutt, and Ravallion (1993). For the developed countries we make use of the data contained\nin the Luxembourg study and also reprinted in Bishop, Formby, and Smith (1991). Both of\nthese data sets coverage is for the 1980s to 1990s. We make use of the Paukert (1973) data\nset for the initial Gini coefficient and share of national income of the median voter.\n4This was the consideration that prevented further extension of the franchise in Western Europe in\nthe 19th century: the conflict between full democracy and preservation of private property.\n5The Gini coefficient measures the size distribution of income. The Gini coefficient takes on values\nbetween 0 and 100 percent. A higher value indicates larger inequality.", "6\nThe following reduced form equations represent propositions 1 and 2 (mentioned\non page 4), where Mid is the pretax share of national income of the third and fourth quintile\nof the population in country i around the year 1965.

Gini is the posttax Gini\ni\ncoefficient for country i in the late 1980s to early 1990s. X is a set of control variables in-\ncluded in most cross-country regressions.6 The control variables include sociopolitical\ninstability index (Spi), population growth rate (Popgr), per capita GDP in 1960 (GDP ),\n60\nbureaucratic efficiency index (Bi), investment to GDP ratio (Inv), and secondary education\nattainment (Sec ).7\n70\nThe interaction term, Trans*GDP, is included in Equation (1) to test if the relation-\nship between the ratio of transfers and Gini coefficient is sensitive to the level of per capita\nincome. Hence apriori (a  +a *GDP ) > 0 for low-income economies and (a  +a *GDP )\n1 2 60 1 2 60\n< 0 for intermediate and high-income economies.\nThe relationship between per capita income and the level of transfers that generates\nongoing growth is expected to be convex, hence b <0 and b >0. The effect of the share of\n1 2\nthe median income groups in national income, Mid, on transfers should be negative. How-\never, strictly speaking, this is only true in democracies where the level of government\ntransfers reflects the preference of voters. To capture the effect of these preferences on trans-\nfers, the interaction term Mid*Dem is included in Equation (2). Apriori, we expect b <0, and\n3\nb +b <0.\n3 4\nThe relationship between the transfers/GDP ratio and economic growth rate varies\nacross levels of per capita income. An increase in the transfers/GDP ratio at a low level\nof income decreases growth. An increase in transfers/GDP ratio at an intermediate or high\nlevel of income increases the rate of economic growth. To capture these differential effects\nacross levels of income, the interaction term Trans*GDP is included in Equation (3). To control\nfor Wagner\u2019s law, GDP is included as a regressor in Equation (2).8\n60 \nFrom column 1 in Table 1 we see that the coefficient on the level of transfers is\nnegative and significant at the 5 percent level. This indicates that as the ratio of transfers\nincreases, the distribution of income improves. Increasing transfer payments by one stan-\ndard deviation (9.5 percent) improves the distribution of income by 0.001 percent, which\n6Levine and Renelt (1990) have shown that without these control variables, most growth regressions\nwill suffer from omitted variables bias.\n7See Appendix B for details on the transfers ratio, political instability index, and sociopolitical in-\nstability index. A higher value of the political rights index, Dem, represents a higher degree of political freedom.\nA higher value of Spi indicates more sociopolitical unrest.\n8According to Wagners\u2019s law as the level of average income increases, government expenditures\nincrease.", "7\nimplies that redistribution is not very effective in generating income equality. The coeffi-\ncient on the interaction term is insignificant at the 5 percent level, which implies that the\nlevel of development has no effect on the success of transfer policy.\nTable 1: Cross-country Estimates\nGini Trans Growth\nI i 7088\nConstant 39.38 (9.1) -12.46 (-1.13) 1.19 (0.25)\nTrans -0.0001 (-3.16) -0.35 (-2.07)\ni\nTrans*GDP 1.044 (1.94) 3.86e-05 (1.93)\ni 60\nGDP 0.011 (4.69) -0.001 (-2.54)\n60\nGDP 2 -6.08e-07 (-3.40)\n60\nMid 0.67 (1.76)\nMid*Dem -0.96 (-3.27)\nBi 0.55 (0.69)\nPopgr -1.61 (-2.74)\nSec 0.047 (1.50)\n70\nSpi 0.13 (1.71)\nInv 0.21 (2.86)\nNote: Procedure used is the weighted two stage least squares method. T-statistics in parenthesis.\nFrom the transfers regression (column two), we see that when the share of the median\nvoter variable interacts with the democracy variable, the coefficient is negative and\nsignificant. This implies that in democracies, if the median voter is close to the higher income\ngroup, transfers will decrease (as indicated by proposition 2, which was mentioned on\npage 4). The coefficient on the share of the median voter variable alone is insignificant, which\nindicates that the median voter or the type of political institution alone does not determine\nthe level of transfers. It is the interaction of the median voter with the degree of political\nfreedom that determines the level of transfers, and only then are voters\u2019 preferences truly\nrepresented by the political process.\nColumn two also indicates a weak inverted U relationship between transfers and per\ncapita income, implying that the wrong level of redistribution is taking place at each level\nof per capita income. This result provides an explanation for the negative coefficient on Trans\nin the column three growth regression. If the wrong level of redistribution is implemented\nat each level of per capita income, redistribution should impede economic growth. The right", "8\namount of redistribution in this context means that the tax rate used to finance the transfers\nis not so high that the incentives for investment are eroded, e.g., the optimal growth pro-\nmoting level of redistribution is being set at each level of income. Other studies by Perotti\n(1994) and Devarajan, Vinaya, and Zhou (1992) find a positive relation between transfers\nand economic growth, however, they claim that this is inconsistent with the theory. The\ninconsistency arises only if the level of redistribution is not set at the optimal level thereby\ncausing an increase in transfer payments to retard economic growth (in this case the level\nof redistribution would be concave in per capita income).\nThe coefficient on transfers in the growth regression has the right sign, given that\nthe wrong level of redistribution has been implemented, and is significant. An increase in\ntransfer payments by one standard deviation leads to a decrease in economic growth by\n3.33 percent. This result suggests that the empirical evidence is strong in substantiating the\ntheoretical proposition that income distribution and the degree of franchise influence the\neconomic growth rate through the fiscal channel in a cross section of countries.\nThe coefficients on population growth and investment ratio are significant at the\n5 percent level and have the right sign. Increases in population growth lead to poor growth\nperformance. Increasing the investment ratio stimulates economic growth. The convergence\nhypothesis put forth by Barro (1991) is also evident according to the negative sign on GDP .\n60\nHowever, this is a side result of the tests since the theory does not make any predictions\nabout convergence.\nFor a given degree of franchise, an egalitarian income distribution today causes an\nincrease in transfer payments. This increase in transfers leads to an improvement of the future\nincome distribution and worsening of the economic growth rate, on average across countries.\nOther cross-country studies by Alesina and Perotti (1993) and Perotti (1994) find very\nweak evidence of the linkage of lagged income distribution to future economic growth\nthrough the fiscal channel. Their results may be partly driven by the type of instruments\nused for the two stage least squares estimation. If the instruments used for the first stage\nregression are weak or they are correlated with the error term, the two stage least squares\nmethod will yield biased estimates.\nB. Time Series Regressions\nIn this section time series data from India and Taipei,China is used to test propo-\nsitions 3 and 4.9 Unfortunately, time series data on pretax distribution of income is not\navailable for either of these countries. Hence we are not able to estimate the fiscal variable\nequation. Estimation of the fiscal variable equation without including a proxy for the pretax\ndistribution of income would lead to omitted variable bias. Hence we only estimate the\nequations for annual average rate of economic growth and annual posttax distribution of\nincome, which is proxied by the Gini coefficient. We give a qualitative assessment of the\nevolution of the tax/GDP ratio for the sample period. Transfers as a percentage of GDP in\nboth countries is very small and showed little variation, hence the ratio of direct federal\ngovernment taxes to GDP is used as the proxy for the redistribution fiscal variable.\nComparing India and Taipei,China is an interesting exercise. The two countries have\nhad very different political regimes after World War II. India has been characterized by\na democratic form of government, while Taipei,China started out with a right-wing\n9See Appendix B for details of the data and sample period.", "9\nauthoritarian regime in the 1960s and has implemented democratic reforms since the early\n1990s, which corresponds to the time period for which the data is available. Both countries\nin the 1960s were classified as low-income economies, hence the initial level of develop-\nment was similar. However, in terms of growth performance and income distribution over\ntime, there are stark differences. During the sample period, approximately 30 years, India\u2019s\naverage annual economic growth rate was 1.89 percent and average posttax Gini coefficient\nwas 32.98 percent. Taipei,China\u2019s average growth rate and posttax Gini coefficient was 6.12\nand 29.63 percent, respectively.\nThe objective in this section is to determine why there are such stark differences in\nthe evolution of economic growth and posttax distribution of income and whether these\ndifferences can partly be explained by the type of fiscal policy implemented in the two\ncountries.\nThe econometric model specification for the two countries is given by the follow-\ning equations.\nGinit =\u03b20+\u03b21Taxratiot+\u03b22GDPt\u22122+\u03c8t (4)\nGrowthrate =\u03b1 +\u03b1GDP +\u03b1Taxratio +aX +\u03be (5)\nt o 1 t 2 t j j t\nwhere X is a set of control variables, consisting of population growth rate and investment\nj\nto GDP ratio.

As the level of per capita income has in-\ncreased, the distribution of income has worsened, which is what we would expect for an\neconomy like Taipei,China.\nThe coefficient on the tax ratio variable is negative and significant at the 10 percent\nlevel in the growth regression, which indicates that an increase in the ratio of taxes worsens\nthe rate of economic growth in economies that start out at a low level of income. These\nresults are weakly consistent with proposition 4. The data for the tax ratio has an upward\ntrend for the period 1953-1992.", "10\nTable 2: Time Series Estimates\nGini Growth rate Gini Growth rate\nt t t t\n(India) (India) (Taipei,China) (Taipei,China)\nConstant 34.88 (4.66) -47.90 (-1.47) 24.85 (35.53) -9.50 (0.33)\nTax ratio -2.08 (-3.13) -5.85 (-2.15) -0.11 (-0.86) -1.59 (-1.83)\nt\nGDP 0.01 (1.19) 4.04e-05 (3.89)\nt-2\nGDP 0.04 (3.58) 0.0002 (1.21)\nt\nPopgr 14.0 (0.97) 11.75 (0.75)\nt\nInv 2.21 (1.55) -0.86 (-1.31)\nt\nNote: Procedure used is the weighted two stage least squares method.

Conclusion\nThe evidence from a cross section of countries suggests that the fiscal channel is\noperative in linking initial income distribution to future economic growth and distribution\nof income. An increase in the median voter\u2019s share of national income for a given level of\ndemocracy decreases transfer payments. A decrease in transfer payments on average across\ncountries improves the rate of economic growth. However, a decrease in transfer payments\nworsens the future posttransfer distribution of income.\nIn contrast to other studies, our cross-country results indicate that an inegalitarian\ninitial income distribution promotes future economic growth. This result is consistent with\nour other finding that on average across countries, the suboptimal level of redistribution\n(in terms of promoting economic growth) has been implemented at each level of per capita\nincome.\nTime series evidence from India and Taipei,China from 1953 to 1992 indicates that\nincreasing the tax ratio hinders economic growth and improves the distribution of income.\nThe distribution of income improved during the 1954-1963 period and shows some\nvolatility during the 1964-1992 period, as per capita income increased in India. In Taipei,China\nper capita income has increased to the intermediate stage, and has been accompanied by\nhigh growth and improvements in income distribution during the 1964-1969 period. However\nthe distribution of income worsened during the 1970-1992 period.\nThe policy implications for low-income economies are that redistribution should be\nset appropriately such that the upper income groups are not discouraged to invest in or-\nder to promote high rates of economic growth. However, during this stage of development,\na worsening distribution of income must be incurred.", "11\nAppendix A\nEconometric Model\nSuppose the reduced form of the model we are interested in estimating is given by:\ny=\u03b2 X+u (A1)\nFirst, a set of instruments is chosen. Then Godfrey\u2019s test for instrument validity is applied. The test consists\nof estimating equation five by the instrumental variables (IV) procedure. Then the residuals obtained from the IV\nestimation are regressed on the full set of instrumental variables, Z. The number of observations multiplied by\nthe R2 from regression five is distributed chi square with m-k degrees of freedom (m and n represent the num-\nber of instruments and explanatory variables respectively) and is used to test the null hypothesis that Z contains\na valid set of instruments.\nu\u02c6 =\u03b3Z+\u03b5 (A2)\nIV\nDavidson and MacKinnon (1993) have stressed that in finite samples, which we have, the number of in-\nstruments should be small relative to the sample size. Otherwise the small sample bias of an IV estimator will\nbe large, even though asymptotic efficiency will increase. In our study the number of observations is large com-\npared to the number of instruments, hence small sample bias is not of serious concern.\nOnce a set of valid instruments has been chosen in terms of conforming to the overidentifying restric-\ntions, we can test whether these instruments are correlated with the suspect endogenous regressors. An F test,\nconsisting of estimating equations seven and eight, tests the null hypothesis that the coefficients on Z are jointly\nequal to 0. This is essentially a goodness of fit test. If the null hypothesis is violated, then Z contains the relevant\nset of regressors.\nyun=\u03c9X+\u03b8(cid:1)+\u03c5 (A3)\nyc =\u03c6 X+\u00b5 (A4)\nOnce a set of variables is determined as being the acceptable instruments, a test to determine endogeneity\nof the suspect regressor has to be conducted. Hausman\u2019s (1978) specification test for endogeneity consists of us-\ning the residuals obtained from estimating the first stage equation for the suspect endogenous variable, X, as a\ni\nregressor in Equation 9. Construction of an F-test enables us to test the null hypothesis that X is an exogenous\nvariable.\ny=(cid:1)X+\u03ba u\u02c6+\u03c1 (A5)\nWe use two types of estimation for the econometric models. Ordinary least squares (OLS) is used as the\nbenchmark procedure. To check for the presence of heteroscedasticity we utilize White\u2019s (1984) test. High order\nserial correlation is detected by using a Lagrange multiplier test. Measurement error in the explanatory variables\nis detected by implementing Klepper-Leamer\u2019s (1984) test.\nFrom the theoretical model we know a priori that the fiscal variable determines the future evolution of\nposttax income distribution and economic growth. However, fiscal policy is itself determined by lagged pretax\nincome distribution, level of democracy, and level of development. Hence the econometric model will consist of\na system of simultaneous equations. The standard procedure for estimation in a simultaneous equations frame-\nwork is the IV procedure.\nHowever, the choice of instruments when estimating within a simultaneous equations framework is crucial.\nRecent studies by Bound, Jaeger, and Baker (1993); Card and Vella (1995); and Nelson and Startz (1990) have in-\ndicated that if the instruments are correlated with the error term or weakly correlated with the endogenous regressor,\nthe instrumental variable estimators will be severely biased.\nThe recent empirical work in the endogenous growth and income distribution literature do not mention\nthe process by which instruments are selected. Usually the ad hoc procedure of using all the predetermined and\nexogenous variables as the instruments is utilized. At most, the choice of instruments is based on economic theory.\nDiagnostic tests are never presented to justify the use of the chosen instruments. Obtaining insignificant coeffi-\ncients on fiscal variables in growth regressions in these studies maybe partly due to the use of inappropriate\ninstruments.\nIn this study we follow Klepinger, Lundberg, and Plotnik\u2019s (1995) selection criteria for instrumental variables.\nInstruments are chosen based on two criteria. They must be valid according to a test of overidentifying restric-\ntions and relevant in explaining the endogenous regressor.\nSince the reduced form equations are within the simultaneous equations framework, Trans maybe an en-\ndogenous regressor. First we select a set of instruments, which includes Inv, Popgr, Spi Bi, Sec , GDP , and the\n70 60\nratio of marginal income taxes to GDP (Mit). Then we conduct the overidentifying restrictions test and goodness", "12\nof fit test to determine whether these instruments are valid and relevant. After the instruments have met the se-\nlection criteria, Hausman\u2019s test for endogeneity is performed. The aforementioned instruments meet the selection\ncriteria. Trans is determined to be an endogenous variable. Therefore, the next set of regressions utilizes a weighted\ntwo stage least squares (W2SLS) procedure to correct for heteroskedasticity and simultaneity bias.1\nAll of the econometric models used for the cross-country and country analysis are overidentified (there\nare more instruments than regressors) according to the order condition. To test the validity of a set of instruments\nin an overidentified model (overidentifying restrictions), Godfrey\u2019s (1988) test is utilized.\n1Results of the instrument selection process are available from the author. Using only the exogenous\nvariables, as most studies do, gave very poor results in terms of statistical significance of the coefficients. This set\nof instruments did not pass the goodness of fit test.", "13\nAppendix B\nDetails of Data\nCross-country Regressions\nWe use as our source for the pretax income distribution data and initial distribution of wealth Paukert\n(1973). For the posttax income distribution data Chen, Dutt, and Ravallion (1993) and Bishop, Formby, and Smith\n(1991).\nWe use the Barro-Lee (1993) primary and secondary school attainment proxy for the human capital stock.\nThe Barro-Lee proxy for human capital considers the years of completed schooling for persons aged 25 and over,\nrather than considering only persons participating in the labor force. The primary schooling attainment variable\nrepresents the percentage of primary schooling attained in the total population, while secondary schooling attained\nrepresents the percentage of secondary schooling attained in the total population. For initial levels of human capital\nstock (Sec ) we use the 1970 data for secondary education attainment.\n70\nThe initial level of development is captured by real per capita GDP in 1960 (GDP ). Real per capita GDP\n60\nis measured at international prices of 1985 using the Summers and Heston (1995) data set.\nThe redistribution variable, Trans, represents expenditure on social security and welfare. Trans is an average\nover the years 1970 to 1988 and is obtained from the IMF Government Finance Statistics (GFS).\nThe political freedom index (Dem) is constructed using averages over 1973-1988. Its value lies in the interval\n0 to 1. A high value of Dem reflects a higher degree of political freedom. This index is obtained from Gastil (1982).\nSpi is the sociopolitical instability index constructed from data averaged over 1960-1985. This data was\nobtained from Alesina and Perotti (1993).\nBi is the bureaucratic efficiency index constructed as an average 1980-1983. A high value of Bi means that\nthe country\u2019s institutions are well-functioning. This data is obtained from Mauro (1995).\nTime Series Regressions\nFor India, data for real per capita GDP, average annual economic growth, and the control variables are\nfrom Summers and Heston (1995) and are for the period 1953-1992. India does not have direct estimates of income\ndistribution on a time series basis. Due to the absence of time series data, most studies have utilized the National\nSample Survey data on distribution of consumption. Chen, Dutt, and Ravallion (1993) and Jain (1975) report national\nGini coefficients representing the posttax distribution of consumption expenditure. There are 14 points from compiled\nfrom these two sources covering the period 1958 to 1991.\nWhite\u2019s test for heteroscedasticity confirms that the error term is not iid. The Lagrange multiplier does\nnot indicate the presence of serial correlation.\nHausman\u2019s specification test reveals that the tax ratio is an endogenous variable. To correct for\nheteroskedasticity and endogeneity, a weighted two stage least squares procedure is used.2\nFor Taipei,China, data for real per capita GDP, average annual economic growth, and the control variables\nare from National Accounts for 1951-1992 (1993) compiled by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting, and\nStatistics, Taipei,China. The data is for the period 1953-1992. Posttax Gini coefficients are obtained from Report\non the Survey of Personal Income Distribution in Taipei (Republic of China 1992), compiled by the Directorate\nGeneral of Budget, Accounting, and Statistics. The data is for the period 1964-1992, and consists of 23 observations.\nWhite\u2019s test for heteroskedasticity confirms that the error term is not iid. The Lagrange multiplier test\nindicates the presence of serial correlation. A quasi-difference method is used to correct for serial correlation.\nHausman\u2019s specification test reveals that the tax ratio is an endogenous variable. To correct for\nheteroskedasticity and endogeneity we use a W2SLS procedure.\n2For the growth rate regression, the instruments are Popgrowth , Inv , GDP , and Gini . In the Gini\nt-1 t-1 t-1 t-1\nregression the instruments are Popgrowth , Inv , GDP, and Gini .\nt-1 t-1 t t-1", "14\nReferences\nAhluwalia, M.
