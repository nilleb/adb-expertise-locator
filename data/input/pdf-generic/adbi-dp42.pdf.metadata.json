Yet, there are still an estimated \n1,000 million people living on less than $1 a day. One way of making progress in achieving the \npoverty reduction goal is by providing financial services to the poor. As Jonathon Morduch, the \nChair of United Nations Expert Group on Poverty Statistics, stated, \u201cMicrofinance stands as one \nof the most promising and cost-effective tools in the fight against global poverty\u201d (Daley-Harris, \n2005).  Furthermore,  in  their  article,  \u201cIs  Microfinance  an  Effective  Strategy  to  Reach  the \nMillennium  Development  Goals?\u201d  Littlefield,  Murdoch  &  Hashemi  (2003)  conclude  that \nmicrofinance  services  reduce poverty  and its  effects in  multiple ways.  Access  to  financial \nservices forms a fundamental basis on which many of the other essential interventions depend. \nMoreover, improvements in health care, nutritional advice and education can be sustained only \nwhen  households  have  increased  earnings  and  greater  control  over  financial  resources \n(Littlefield, Murdoch & Hashemi, 2003). As of December 31, 2004, 3,164 microcredit institutions \nhave reported reaching 92,270,289 clients, 66,614,871 of whom were among the poorest when \nthey took their first loan (Daley-Harris, 2005). Assuming five persons per family, the 66.6 million \npoorest clients reached by the end of 2004 affected some 333 million family members. \n \nDespite this success, about half a billion poor households remain without access (Ivatury, \n2005). The gap is even larger in rural areas. One of the main factors that prevent microfinance \ninstitutions (MFIs) from going to rural areas is the large geographical spread, low population \ndensity and small volume of transactions, which makes it more costly to operate there. MFIs \nface a challenge to explore creative approaches to cut down cost while serving poor people, \nespecially in remote rural areas. Because it is too costly to set up a physical branch, traditional \nbank branches, alone, do not seem to be the answer for reaching small rural depositors and \nborrowers (Hirschland, 2003). Alternative delivery systems need to be examined for their merits.  \n \nRecently, information and communication technologies (ICT) have emerged as a \npowerful tool to reduce operating costs, making it viable for financial institutions to expand into \nrural and low-income areas. ICT innovations such as a personal computer connected to the \ninternet, a mobile phone, an automated teller machine (ATM) or a point-of-sale (POS) device \nlocated at a retail or postal outlet, may be less expensive to establish than branches located in \nrural areas and more convenient for customers (Ivatury, 2005). Unlike pure cash based \ntransactions, ICT-based transactions can take place with less time or with no time required from \na teller. Rather than hand over cash to a teller when making a deposit or loan repayment, a \ncustomer can give cash to a store clerk, swipe a debit card through a POS card reader, and \ninput an identification number to authorize the transaction. The store\u2019s account at the financial \ninstitution would be debited by an amount equivalent to the cash deposit, and the customer\u2019s \nwould be credited. Since the transaction is electronic, from the institution\u2019s perspective, it is less \ncostly to process.  \n \nIt is this possibility of ICT solutions for expanding the rural finance frontier that has \nstimulated this paper. The main objective is to review literature on the application of ICT \nsolutions in microfinance and analyze the possible use of ICT solutions for expanding  \nmicrofinance services to rural remote areas by looking at the challenges and issues in the case \nof Mongolia.  \n \n  1", "The data is drawn from an extensive literature review of both electronic and printed \nmaterial. In addition, primary data was collected during a two-week fieldwork in Mongolia in \nSeptember 2005. The main data collection method was an in-depth individual interview with key \nstakeholders, such as in the major financial institutions, internet service providers, private sector \nentities that supply ICT hardware, the government agency in charge of communication \ninfrastructure, the Bank of Mongolia, and customers. In all cases, a snowball sampling \ntechnique was used.1 In total, 25 individuals were interviewed (see Appendix 1 for the list of \ninterviewees). The paper focuses on the case of XacBank, one of the leading microfinance \ninstitutions in Mongolia, for demonstrating feasible and appropriate applications of ICT in rural \nfinance.  In the last section, the paper summarizes the key challenges and issues for \nmicrofinance institutions, donors and governments to consider in applying ICT for expanding the \nrural finance frontier. \n \nThe literature indicates that ICT innovations have an exciting promise to improve the \nefficiency of microfinance operations and expand outreach by lowering transaction costs and \nbringing services closer to clients. However, many of the cases that used as examples of ICT \napplication are either still in the pilot phase or are not really financial institutions whose main \nmission is to serve the poor and reduce poverty. The latter refers to cases of ICT application in \nmainstream financial institutions, which may not be necessarily serving the poor. The number of \nmicrofinance institutions that have gone beyond piloting ICT applications is still limited. They are \nprimarily in countries which have economies of scale, a relatively developed financial services \nsector, and a more favorable communication infrastructure and regulatory environment. It is also \nfound that it will be a while until MFIs will be able to fully utilize all the potential of ICT. It may be \nmore realistic to take small steps in applying ICT in some functions of microfinance operations. \nFor example, MFIs in many developing countries are not ready to make the full investment in \ncomplete ICT solutions. Rather, at least some of them may be able to invest in smaller-scale \ntechnology solutions that can result in concrete benefits worth the cost involved. This suggests \nthe importance of detailed cost benefit analysis. There is no such analysis available to date. In \nthe absence of a more rigorous cost benefit analysis, an examination of feasible ICT solutions \nbased on a given context and institutional factors may be a good starting point. This paper \npresents an analysis of four possible ICT solutions in the case of Xacbank in Mongolia.   \n \n                                                 \n1 Snowball sampling is a special non-probability method used when the desired sample characteristic is rare. It may \nbe extremely difficult or cost prohibitive to locate respondents in these situations. Snowball sampling relies on \nreferrals from initial subjects to generate additional subjects. While this technique can dramatically lower search \ncosts, it comes at the expense of introducing bias because the technique itself reduces the likelihood that the sample \nwill represent a good cross section of the population. See: http://www.statpac.com/surveys/sampling.htm \n \n  2", "Challenges of rural finance \n \nDespite the success of microfinance services in many countries, access to financial \nservices in remote rural areas remains a challenge. The three main challenges that contribute to \nrural poverty are: \n \nDependency on agriculture: \n-  Subject to weather risk \n-  Seasonality \n-  Poor productivity \n-  Out of date technology \n-  Domestic ag.products \nbeaten by foreign products \nLimited access to basic \nHigh transaction cost: \nservices: \n-  Poor infrastructure \n-  Health \n-  Low density \n-  Education \n-  Remoteness \n-  Market \n \n \nIt has been repeatedly recognized that the majority of the people in rural areas depend \non agriculture as a source of living. Agriculture is widely considered more risky economically \nthan industry and trade. Weather, pests, disease and other natural calamities affect the yield of \ncrops. Markets and prices are additional risks associated with agriculture. Many agricultural \nmarkets are imperfect, lacking information and communications infrastructure. Prices are also \naffected by the access to markets. Market and price risks can also be exacerbated by \ninternational market conditions and public policy decisions. For example, the creation or \nremoval of tariff barriers in countries where goods are ultimately sold can dramatically change \nlocal prices, hence affecting rural farmers (Christen & Pearce, 2005). The precision of crop \nschedules generates a specific risk for agricultural finance. Loan disbursements need to be \ntailored to irregular cash flows, yet the timing of final crop income may vary, based on when \nfarmers choose to sell. These characteristics require financial institutions to be efficient and \nphysically close to their rural clients.  \n \nYet, transaction costs are high and the volume of business in remote rural areas, where \nmany poor people live, cannot support the cost of a bank branch. The problem is worsened by a \nlow density of population and poor infrastructure in rural areas. From an institutional point of \nview, the main problems include: 2 \n \n(cid:190) Small size average farm size, low population density, higher loan servicing costs due to \nlimited lending volume and high information costs \n                                                 \n2For limitations from thecustomers\u2019 point of view, see Langenbucher, (2005).  \n  3", " \n(cid:190) No branches or a limited branch network in rural areas \n \n(cid:190) Lack of collateral or adequate security among rural people  \n \n(cid:190) Lack of technical knowledge at the bank level to evaluate and analyze the \ncreditworthiness of rural customers \n \n(cid:190) Risk correlation when lending to farmers: all borrowers are affected by the same risk, \nsuch as low market prices and reduced yields due to the weather \n \n(cid:190) Underdeveloped communication and transportation infrastructure. \n \nFurthermore, when exploring solutions for appropriate financial service delivery in rural areas, it \nmust be noted that the transactions between various parties (banks, traders, input dealers and \nfarmers/consumers) are predominantly cash based and are very low in value. The cost of cash \nbased transactions is higher (as compared to electronic/non-cash based transactions) due to \nthe following additional costs: \n \nCost of idle cash: Idle cash, lying either with the bank branch, a merchant or a consumer, does \nnot earn any interest and the party holding it has to bear the cost of interest lost. Thus higher \nthe idle cash, the higher the cost of interest lost.  \n \nCost of cash handling infrastructure: This includes cost of branch set-up, cost of manpower and \nthe cost of cash security. This cost increases with the decrease in value of transaction and the \ndecrease in the denomination of currency transacted.  \n \nGeographical spread of customers: If the current structure of the bank branches were to be \nused to cater to the needs of the rural population, it would mean setting up a bank branch in \nvirtually every village. The cost of such a large network would not justify the revenues generated \nfrom it, given the nature of the transactions. Thus, the challenge for banks is to develop a low-\ncost network/delivery channel with a high outreach and flexibility with respect to the timing of its \noperation.  \n \nIt can be observed that the main constraint related to institutional design and delivery \nmechanisms that contributes to the absence of functioning rural financial markets and \ninstitutions is the high transaction and supervisory costs. There is a trade-off between \nminimizing loan default and supervisory costs, but the nature of rural lending, especially in \nagriculture, makes transaction costs and supervision costs disproportionately high relative to \nurban lending. The large geographical spread of customers, coupled with poor transportation \nand communication infrastructure, increases supervisory costs for financial institutions and \ncompliance costs for customers. In addition, it is extremely difficult to attract qualified and \ntrained loan officers to work in rural areas without much higher compensatory benefits.  \n \nIn order to extend microfinance services in rural areas, technology solutions have to \naddress these challenges. The following section will give an overview of ICT innovations that \nhave emerged in microfinance.  \n \n \n  4", "Innovations of information and communication technology \n \nThere is an increasing recognition of ICT potential in contributing to income generation \nand poverty reduction. It enables people and enterprises to capture economic opportunities by \nincreasing process efficiency, promoting participation in expanded economic networks and \ncreating opportunities for employment. For example, online portals for are providing farmers \nwith a variety of information including market prices, weather reports, and farming best- \npractices. They can also provide isolated communities with access to the latest health \ninformation and treatment and inform officials of rural public health issues.  \n \nSpecifically in relation to microfinance the use of ICT began with the arrival of the Palm \nPilot (or called, Personal Digital Assistant \u2013 PDA). These pocket computers allowed loan \nofficers to fill out forms containing customer information and provide an initial indication of \nwhether loan would be approved or not in the field, thereby automating the information \ngathering process (Silva, 2002). In a series of articles by Steve Whelan, for The Consultative \nGroup to Assist the Poorest (CGAP), talks of the various technological devices that are currently \nbeing used around the world (Whelan, 2003). These articles highlight devices such as \nautomated teller machines (ATMs), interactive voice response technology (IVRs), smart cards \nand personal digital assistants (PDAs). The series also has an article on how biometrics is used \nby MFIs in various parts of the world. These articles give the usage of these devices, their \nrequirements and how they work, their costs and benefits, and who should use them.  \n \nMoreover, in recent years, with the coming of the digital age, there has been a growing \nawareness of the significance of information. MFIs have understood that poor information \nsystems have an impact on every aspect of an institution's performance, from operational \neffectiveness to strategic management. As the scale of operations grows, MFIs feel the need for \nhaving an integrated and well developed information system to handle their portfolio and \ntransactions. It is also necessary in taking appropriate policy decisions to provide efficient, \neffective, and transparent services to clients, while maintaining effective time management and \nincreasing outreach. Gibbons and Meehan claim the use of a management information system \n(MIS) will improve efficiency and increase outreach (Gibson & Meehan, June 2000). Therefore, \nthere is a need for the use of technology by the microfinance sector for both a greater outreach \nand efficiency at a lower cost to the people. \n \nBelow is the summary of most commonly used ICT applications in microfinance.3  \n \nAutomated Teller Machines (ATMs) or Point of Sales (POS) devices\u2013 conduct many banking \ntransactions that would otherwise require staff attention: they furnish account information, \naccept deposits, draw down on pre-approved loans and transfer funds. These are the main ICT \napplications in microfinance and we discuss them in more detail below \n \nInteractive voice response (IVR) technology - refers to examples like using phones (either \nmobile or stationary phones) to check an account balance, make transfers, learn about products, \n                                                 \n3 Discussion of information and communication technology, especially management information systems, in \nmicrofinance can be bewildering.  This paper provides a brief description of various technologies. For more detailed \ndescriptions, check at least the following three key websites that have compiled a collection of articles and \npublications to guide readers and provide more detailed descriptions of these technologies. They are: CGAP \nTechnology Resource Center at www.cgap.org/technology/, Microfinance Gateway at www.microfinancegateway.org, \nand Microsave at www.microsave.org  \n  5", "and find the nearest branch location and its office hours. This saves time both for the clients and \nstaff.  \n \nInternet banking \u2013clients can make the same transactions as with phone banking (checking \ntheir account balance, making transfers, learning about products and finding the nearest branch \nlocation and its office hours) on the Internet.  \n \nPersonal digital assistant (PDA) \u2013 can be used by loan officers to process loan applications \nby using the preset credit scoring model, to review a client\u2019s historical data, and to monitor loan \nperformance by reviewing the list of borrowers and their loan repayment status. Virtually all \nclient data and client visit records are stored electronically and are immediately available in this \nsmall device (like a palm pilot). \n \nManagement information system (MIS):  - provides computerized data processing for \nmanagement decision making; it is used primarily for portfolio management, accounting and \nfinancial performance management.4  \n \nCredit scoring \u2013 analyzes historical client data, identifies links between client characteristics \nand behavior; and assumes those links will persist to predict how clients will act. The technology \ncan help a microfinance institution analyze how its clients have behaved in the past to make \nmore reliable loan application decisions, devise more effective collection strategies, better target \nmarketing efforts and increase client retention.  \n \nComplimentary devices:  \nSmart cards \u2013 can be used for financial services, such as managing savings accounts, \ndisbursing loans, or making transfers. There are different forms of personal identification, such \nas biometric technology and fingerprinting. Smart cards function like an electronic passbook. \nThere is also a lower cost card, which operates through a magnetic strip on the reverse side of \nthe card. A smart card differs in that it operates through more expensive chips that can store \ninformation offline on the embedded chips. Both cards are used in conjunction with ATMs or \nPOS.   \n \nBiometric technology \u2013 measures an individual\u2019s unique physical or behavioral characteristics, \nvoice pattern and gait, to recognize and confirm identity. This is a supplementary technology \nused with ATMs or POS.  \n \nEach of these technologies can help microfinance operations in various functions, as illustrated \nin table1 (see also Reille & Ivatury, 2003)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4 There are comprehensive reviews of various software developed for management information system that are \nposted in Technology Resource Center of CGAP: http://www.cgap.org/technology/ \n  6", "Table 1:  \nICT applications in microfinance operations \n \nCards \n(magnetic Phone \nand  banking/I\nPDA/Pal smart  nternet  ATM/  Credit \n Functions  m Pilot  cards)  banking  POS  MIS  scoring \nEntering loan application data                   \nRecording payment transaction \n(e.g. passbook function)                   \nDisbursing cash                   \nMoney transfer between accounts                   \nTaking deposits                   \nChecking account balance/other \ninquiries                   \nManaging loan portfolio/other \nfinancial analysis                   \nCredit risk assessment                   \n \n \nPDA/Palm Pilots are used for account opening and transactions, while phone banking and \ninternet banking are primarily used in transactions.

On the \nother hand, ATMs and POS devices can be used in all aspects of operational chain, and hence \nare the most promising and comprehensive ICT solutions.  \n \nIn terms of geographical spread of ICT applications in microfinance, Figure 2 demonstrates that \nthere is still a very limited coverage. 5 Clearly, the least innovations are applied in Asia, with the \nexception of India and the Philippines. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n5 For a detailed list of ICT innovations in financial services, see Claessens, Glaessner and Klingebiel, (2001), Ivatury, \n(2005) and Waterfield, (2004). Note that some of these applications are implemented by commercial banks, hence \nnot all users are necessarily all microfinance institutions serving poor people. Information on how many users are \nserving rural areas and how many of them reach poor people is not available. \n  7", "Figure 2  \nMapping of ICT applications in Microfinance  \n \n \n \nCzech  Moldova \nRepublic \nKoso\nPoland  vo Tajikstan  Mongolia \nEl \nSalvador Alban Armenia \nia\nMexico   \nDomimican  Bangladesh \nHaiti  Republic \n  Namibia \nEcuador    Uganda\nSenegal    India Philippines \nCosta \nHonduras  Rica\nVenezu Malaysia   \nela Keny\nGuatemala    a\nNigeri Indonesia \nColombia  Brazil  a Tanzani\nNicarag\na\nua\nBotswana\nMalawi\nPeru  Bolivi Cameroon Zambia  \n  a\nParaguay Zimbabwe\nATM / POS       \nChile  South Africa \nPalm pilot / PDA \nSwaziland\nSmart card         \nPhone / Internet banking \n \n \nThe main reasons that appear to influence the uptake of ICT applications in microfinance are: \n \n\u2022  Direct and indirect cost of implementing ICT applications \n\u2022  Policy and regulatory environment \n\u2022  Infrastructure development (communications, connectivity, power, etc) \n\u2022  Development stage of the financial sector, especially the microfinance sector \n\u2022  Level of financial literacy (mentality towards using technology versus human interaction) \n\u2022  Population density \n\u2022  Language. \n \nDependent on these factors, ICT solutions have been applied mostly in countries that have a \nlarger population density (such as India, Mexico and the Philippines), a more favorable \nregulatory and policy environment (such as South Africa and Brazil) and a more mature financial \nsector (such as South Africa). Cracknell (2004) reaffirms the importance of an enabling \nenvironment, that is well developed banking and retail sectors, a supportive central bank, good \ncommunications and a generally positive policy environment.  \n \n  8", "Figure 2 also demonstrates that there are many more application of ATM and POS \ncompared to other innovations such as Palm Pilot, Smart card and Internet/Phone banking, with \nthe exception of ACCION International which has implemented Palm Pilots (PDA) in all of its \naffiliates in Latin America.  \n \nOur literature review indicates that the most common benefits expected from the use of ICT in \nmicrofinance, for clients and for MFIs, are: \n \nClients:  \n\u2022  Access to banking services \n\u2022  More convenient service \u2013 anytime to conduct transaction \n\u2022  No time to wait in line \n\u2022  Faster loan processing (with PDA) in the field \nMFIs: \n\u2022  Reduced transaction cost (by reducing staff time) \n\u2022  Less fraud (better internal control and less cash transactions) \n\u2022  Improved quality of financial information (better performance management due to faster \nand better quality data processing) \n\u2022  Increased outreach (by making services available 24 hours and closer to clients) \n\u2022  Reduction in expensive premises (if ATMs or POS devices are placed in off-site \nlocations) \n\u2022  More professional look  \n\u2022  Increase customer satisfaction and loyalty (by introducing new types of services, such as \nmoney transfers and direct deposits). \n \nThere is a tendency in the literature to generalize these benefits to any ICT application. \nHowever, not every application will result in the same benefits. Table 2 summarizes the benefits \nthat may be associated with different ICT applications. PDA/Palm Pilots are likely to improve the \nefficiency of staff in recording transaction data and the quality of data entered. Smart cards also \nplay similar roles in that they will allow transactions to be recorded electronically. PDAs are \nused by loan officers, while smart cards are used by clients.  \n \nTable 2  \nBenefits by type of ICT applications for an institution \n \nPDA/PalmPilot  Save staff time entering loan transactions twice: on paper and on PC \nImprove accuracy of transaction data  \nAllow MFIs to build electronic database of clients\u2019 profile and \nperformance \nAllow loan officers to access the MIS from the field (better portfolio \nmonitoring) \nSmart card  Save staff time from entering loan transactions data, since it is \nelectronically entered (no repetitive form filling) \nImprove transaction accuracy \nAllow MFIs to build electronic database of clients\u2019 profile and \nperformance \nStrengthen account management due to built in limits on credit and other \naccounts \nReduce possibility of fraud by eliminating cash transactions and using \nmore secure user identity and account information \n  9", "Phone  Save staff time to conduct transactions in person \nbanking/Internet  Provide electronic database of all transactions \nbanking  Improve quality of transaction data \nImprove client satisfaction by providing convenience \nATM/POS  Increase outreach and market coverage  \nImprove client satisfaction by providing more convenient and faster \nservices to clients  \nReduce expensive premises (if not installed in branch office) \nMinimize fraud by eliminating cash transactions by staff \nReduce staff time to conduct transactions in person \n (in some cases, they still need staff person) \nMIS  Improve quality of info management \nStreamline and shorten the decision making process  \nMake it possible to perform analyses on clients, operations and products \nCredit scoring  Streamline the loan processing (some decisions may still need more \nqualitative considerations) \nEstablish credit history for clients \n \n \nOn the other hand, phone banking and internet banking allow clients to access their account \ninformation by phone or on the internet and transfer funds electronically, including making \npayment directly from their accounts.  All transactions are recorded electronically and data are \nintegrated to the MFI\u2019s MIS. This saves staff time, improves the quality of data, and provides an \nelectronic database for all transactions of the MFI. In addition, the MFI improves its client \nsatisfaction and loyalty by offering more convenient access to account information and allows \nclients to conduct transactions online or by phone without having to come to a branch office in \nperson.  \n \nIn addition to these benefits, ATM/POS devices offer more service delivery functions, some of \nwhich replace staff responsibilities. As these offer the greatest immediate scope for application \nwe discuss them separately in more detail.  \n \nAutomatic Teller Machines \n \nHirschland (2003) observes that ATMs provide 24-hour access to speedy transactions. \nATMs, supplemented by smart cards and debit cards can provide flexible payment options and \nmore convenient access to client accounts. They can also reduce branch infrastructure and \nemployee costs, and facilitate financial services in areas with poor communications and \nelectricity supplies. In particular, staff of MFIs could be relieved of some mundane functions like \nprocessing withdrawals and fund transfer over the counter, and rather, focus on personalized \nservices. When fully utilized, ATMs can be used for balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, transfer of \nfunds, bill payments and making deposits.  \n \nIn Bolivia, PRODEM has extended its branch network by installing 20 ATMs. These \nmachines have some unique features: they are equipped with fingerprint readers for client \nverification and they provide audio instructions in three languages, to make financial services \nmore accessible to illiterate and semiliterate clients and to those who do not speak Spanish. \nBecause ATMs are linked to smart cards (which contain information on client accounts and \nprevious transactions), they only have to update data from the central processing site twice a \nday-saving about US$800,000 a year in internet access charges. Smart cards cost clients $10 \nto obtain, and $7 a year in operating fees. PRODEM\u2019s ATMs cost less than $20,000 each, \n  10", "making their installation economical, when compared to the costs of setting up a branch office \n(Whelan, 2003).  \n \nIn Ecuador, a network of ATMs enables poor and rural families to access remittances \nsent by relatives working in Spain. Banco Solidario, an Ecuadorian bank for poor people, offers \na debit card that clients can use to withdraw money deposited in Spanish savings banks, \nincluding La Ciaxa, Caja Madrid and Caja Murcia, as well as Banca Sella in Italy. Clients can \naccess remittances at more than 800 ATMs nationwide, or at any of about 100 cooperatives \nwith whom Banco Solidario has strategic alliance (Christen & Pearce, 2005).  \n \nThe services provided by ATMs \n \nThe advent of the ATMs has enabled financial institutions to provide their customers with a wide \nvariety of banking services twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week without a significant \nincrease in personnel, when ATMs are utilized to their full capacity.  \nThe most common service that ATMs are capable of offering is the withdrawal from checking or \npassbook accounts. The same result was found by the survey of banks conducted by the Office \nof the Comptroller of the Currency as early as 1975 (McLeod, 1979).  \n \nExpected Benefits: \n \n(cid:190) Reduces transaction cost: typical ATM transactions are a fraction of the cost of teller \ntransactions (Ketley & Duminy, 2003) \n(cid:190) Provides more convenient access to customers: In its classic form, ATMs are able to \noffer 24-hour access for clients who want to withdraw, deposit, transfer funds or inquire \nabout their account balance. However, the access will depend on how ATM is installed: \nwhether it is placed in its own booth with access to clients, or in a banking hall which \ncloses at certain times. \n(cid:190) Frees staff time to handle more personalized customer interactions, rather than routine \ndeposit-taking and balance checking. \n(cid:190) Increases savings mobilization as a result of widened and any-time access points. \n \nLimitations of ATMs \n \nWhile an ATM offers a potential to provide a wider and easier access to poor people in rural \nareas as a delivery channel, it faces a number of issues that need to be addressed: \n \nCost: The cost of a smart card may be significantly higher than that of a conventional passbook \nmaking the former relevant only for the better-off poor.  \n \nCash based economy:  Most rural areas are still heavily based on cash transactions. Day \nlaborers are unlikely to be able to use card-based cash. In order to expand the use of cards in \nrural areas, all merchants and service points will have to introduce card payment systems. At \npresent, the roadside stalls and service points in rural areas are unlikely to be able to afford to \nbuy or maintain a POS device.  \n \nOperating instructions: With a typical ATM, transactions are driven by language on a screen. \nThis system excludes savers who are not literate.  PRODEM in Bolivia has overcome this \nobstacle by developing an interactive \u201cintelligent automatic teller machine\u201d which identifies \nclients and their native language by their fingerprint. However, this will not be crucial in Mongolia, \nwhere the level of literacy is relatively high even in rural areas. However, it was noted that most \n  11", "ATMs have instructions in the English language. This could raise a concern unless the \ninstruction screen is translated into Mongolian.  \n \nFunctionality: When fully utilized, ATM has a capacity to offer a wide range of functions. But in \nmost developing countries, ATMs are not fully utilized primarily due to cost: the price gets higher \nthe more functions are put into force. Furthermore, there are limitations as to what ATMs can do. \nFor instance, ATMs cannot take a loan application, review it and approve a loan. The human \ntouch is still necessary for fully-fledged banking services.  \n \nCurrency recognition: Local currency has to be recognized by an international network of ATM \nmanufacturers in order for ATMs to recognize and accept a local currency note. Furthermore, \npoor people usually have money in small units, most of which are not necessarily freshly printed \nYet, cash that can be accepted by ATMs will have to meet certain quality standard. If not, they \nwill be rejected.  \n \nCustomer trust: It was concluded during the virtual conference facilitated by CGAP and \nMicrosave6 that physical presence and the bigger issue of building trust is essential in serving \nsmall depositors. This is even more so in rural areas, where formal financial services have been \nlimited, if not absent. The conference participants indicated that building at least medium-sized \nfull service branches that inspire people\u2019s trust is an important investment. Therefore, the use of \nATMs cannot be assumed to be a complete substitute for a physical branch, at least in \nmobilizing savings.  \n \n \nPoint of Sale terminals  \n \nFinancial institutions are increasingly installing point-of-sale (POS) terminals in retail \noutlets. These terminals are typically used for authorizations of credit card and demand deposit \ntransactions as well as for account balance inquiries. The purpose of a POS terminal system is \nto allow a customer to make payment for goods and services at a merchant location with the \nmaximum ease and convenience and the minimum cost and expense to the merchant and the \nfinancial institution.  \n \nThe cost of POS terminals is directly related to the number of functions the machine will \nperform and the degree of automation. While some institutions partner with others and jointly \nown and operate the switching and processing centers, others install and own POS terminals \nindividually. There are three models that have been identified in using POS technology. 7  \n \nModel 1: Customers use their debit or credit cards to make payments to vendors. The \nPOS device does not allow withdrawals or deposits. Customers must visit bank branches to \napply for loans, deposit cash, or open a new account. In this model, the POS technology \nrequires no handling of cash by the customer or the retail outlet that has the POS device.  \n \nModel 2: Customers can deposit and withdraw cash, and possibly transfer money to \nother account-holders. The POS device identifies and authenticates the client and authorizes \nthe transaction, but the cash counting, handling and storage are the responsibility of the \nretailer\u2019s staff or a store employee dedicated for this purpose. Clients have less need to visit \n                                                 \n6 The virtual exchange was entitled  \u201cServing small depositors: meeting demand while managing costs\u201d and was \ncarried out during December 5 \u2013 9, 2005.  \n7 CGAP Technology Center: www.cgap.org/technology \n  12", "bank branches, and can transact at more convenient times and places. However, they must still \nvisit branches to open accounts and handle more complicated transactions, such as applying for \ncredit cards or term loans. The bank must ensure that the retailer is properly handling cash on \nits behalf. Five of the seven institutions that provided detailed information to CGAP on their POS \ndevices reported using this model. \n \nModel 3: A full service channel provides the full range of banking services to retail or \npostal outlets that may be nearer to clients. Again, the POS handles the transaction processing \nand the human attendant performs basic cash handling and customer service functions. But in \nthis case, customers are allowed to open new accounts and apply for loans. In some cases, an \nMFI or other third party may perform loan appraisal and follow up or monitoring functions.  \n \nIt is this last model that brings the full range of financial services to the poor in rural \nareas, hence as discussed below it seems the most promising solution in the Mongolian context \nfor XacBank. In Mongolia, as elsewhere, it is necessary to analyze the reactions of customers to \nadvances in electronic payments systems in order to effectively eliminate the potential barriers \nin the early stages of development. Most surveys suggest that customers see the convenience \nthat an electronic payments system provides. The major disadvantages for them are the fear of \nthe machines, and a concern over an invasion of privacy and the possibility of errors.  \n \nThe rest of the paper explores the feasibility of  utilizing ICT solutions for microfinance \nservices in rural areas of Mongolia. \nCase of Mongolia \n \nWhile many of these ICT applications are highly innovative, they often cannot overcome \nthe specific barriers that limit the provision of microfinance in rural areas. Furthermore, some \nICT applications require a certain level of infrastructure, an enabling environment, institutional \ncapacity and human resources that may not be available in a developing country. An \nappropriate ICT solution needs to be identified through a detailed analysis of a context in which \nit will be applied. This section describes the socio-economic conditions in Mongolia, and the \nchallenges and gaps in extending microfinance services in rural areas in the country.  \n \nMongolia is one of world's most sparsely populated countries, with an area of 1.6 million \nsquare meters and a population of 2.5 million. The country is divided into 22 aimags, the second \nlargest administrative division in the country, and the 22 aimags are sub-divided into 321 \nsoums.  47% of the total population of Mongolia resides in soums (equal to a village); 11% are \nin aimag centers (provincial centers), and 42% are in the larger cities (Ulaanbaatar, Darhan and \nErdenet).  \nOne of the biggest challenges for financial development in Mongolia is the low \npopulation density.  Mongolia has a population density of only 1.6 people per square kilometer, \nwhich is one of the lowest densities in the world.8  It is much lower in rural areas. 65% of the \ntotal population lives in urban areas9, while the total area for the rural market is 86 times larger \nthan for the urban market. Due to the low population density and poor infrastructure, rural \npeople have difficulties accessing basic services, including financial services.   \n \n                                                 \n8 Mongolian Statistical Yearbook 2003, National Statistical Office (NSO) of Mongolia   \n9 Population and development indicators 2002.  For example, population density in the capital Ulaanbaatar and other \nmajor cities is 75 times higher than in Selenge, the highest density aimag. \n  13", "Although the Mongolian economy has begun to stabilize after severe national crises \nduring the early and mid 1990s, the transition from a controlled economy to a free market one \nhas perpetuated wealth disparity and created unemployment.  As in other formerly socialist \ncountries, the transition left many state employees jobless.  The social safety net made up of \npensions, benefits, health care and education suffered severe cutbacks.  As a result, large \nnumbers of people in both small rural towns and more urban areas have only modest, informal \nand sporadic income opportunities. The section of the population that falls into this category has \nincreased significantly since a series of winter disasters, or dzuds, between 1999 and 2002, \nduring which over one third of all livestock (the mainstay of the rural and national economy) \ndied.  Tens of thousands of herders, especially those less experienced pastoralists, who only \nbegan practicing animal husbandry after losing government jobs, were entirely or almost entirely \ndispossessed, and moved, jobless, to villages (bag center), towns (soum center) and cities \n(aimag center, capital city). Recent estimates suggest that Mongolia's rural poverty ratio has \nincreased (from 33% to 43% over the years 1999-2003).  \n \nThe Mongolian banking sector, and in particular, the micro finance sector, has grown \nrapidly since the late 1990s, in the aftermath of the bankruptcy of a majority of the banks.  Yet \nmost of the fast emerging financial service providers are concentrated in urban areas. Only two \nbanks in particular, XacBank and XAAN Bank, have outreach to rural areas at the soum level. \nThey claim to serve around 100,000 micro clients between them.  However, most of these micro \nloans are disbursed primarily through their branch offices in the capital city or at the provincial \ncenters (aimag), excluding those in remote rural areas (in soums and bags).10  \n \nFinancial institutions in Mongolia have been wary of rural and poverty lending. One of \nthe primary reasons, among others, is attributed to higher transaction costs due to low \npopulation density and poor infrastructure. The market size and the density of clients are \nimportant factors for successful microfinance.  When clients scattered over a large geographic \narea and financial institutions\u2019 local offices fully controlled and supervised by central offices in \nthe capital, as is the case in Mongolia, transaction costs are obviously very high. Thus, MFIs \nmust find a special delivery mechanism to provide services for people living in rural areas in a \nsustainable manner.  \n \nXacBank and its rural finance strategies \n \nXacBank is a leading microfinance institution in Mongolia. It had its beginnings in the \nMicroStart Mongolia project funded by United Nations Development program (UNDP) in 1997. \nXAC, the finance company which grew out of the project, became a very dynamic and \nentrepreneurial MFI using a unique individual loan methodology.11 In just 2 \u00bd years of \noperations, XAC demonstrated an impressive performance. The institution established a \nnetwork of 13 branches, managing a loan portfolio of US$854,000 and serving over 3,600 \nclients. Furthermore, XAC maintained excellent portfolio quality (Portfolio at Risk of 1 day or \nmore late is 0.3% as of April 2001) and reached operational self-sufficiency after 8 months of \noperation. In October 1999, XAC registered as the nation\u2019s first non-bank financial institution. In \n                                                 \n10 XAAN bank does have branch offices in all soum centers. However, their outreach has been limited to salaried \nemployees, pensioners, businesses that are engaged in trade or service with quick turnover. There is a limited \noutreach to small scale herders (especially those with less than 300 head of livestock) and micro-enterprises that do \nnot have collateral.  \n11 XAC means \u201cGolden Fund for Development\u201d (pronounced HAS as in HAT) \n  14", "the last quarter of 2001, XAC merged with Goviin Ehlel (Gobi Start)12 and as a result, XacBank \nwas created. The banking license was obtained in January 2002. Now, XacBank, the banking \nsubsidiary of XAC-GE group, is incorporated as a limited liability commercial bank with a license \nto conduct banking activities. Headquartered in the country\u2019s capital Ulaanbaatar, XacBank \noperates branches in all of the provinces (aimags) of Mongolia.  \n \nAs part of its mission, XacBank strives to continue its strategic focus on rural markets. In \n2002, the Bank piloted an agricultural lending program in six aimags and disbursed loans of \nUSD 42.5 \u2013 12,755 primarily for agriculture.  In 2003, it opened five new branch offices, making \nXacBank the third banking network with a nationwide presence. At the end of 2003, 21 \nbranches (65 percent of all branches) were located in each of the aimag centers (Figure 3). The \nclients served through these branches comprise 62 percent of total borrowers. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3  Map of XacBank branches \n \nIn June of 2003, the Bank activated its facility under IFAD\u2019s Rural Poverty  \nProgram in collaboration with the Government of Mongolia. This program was targeted toward \nArhangay, Bulgan, Huvsgul and Hentiy aimags, which are mainly agricultural and livestock \nbreeding regions. 2, 435 loans totaling USD 1615.64 were disbursed in the four aimags.  \n \nCompared to the banking sector as a whole, XacBank has a larger share of the market \nin the rural areas (see Figure 4). When reviewed aimag by aimag, XacBank has gained an \nincreasing share of the lending market. However the rural clients are currently served by \nbranches located in the aimag centers. Yet, the majority of the rural population lives in soums \noutside the aimag centers. Only 1.4% of XacBank borrowers are herders, and loans for \nlivestock account for only 0.8% of the total portfolio as of December 2003 (See Figure 5).     \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n12 Goviin Ehlel, then the second largest non-bank financial institution, was established by Mercy Corps in December \n1999 with funding from USAID and received its license in March 2000.  \n  15", "Figure 4 \nShare of XacBank portfolio compared to banking system \n \nShare of loan portfolio by location\n90.0% 84.2%\n80.0%\n70.0%\n59.6%\n60.0%\n50.0%\n40.0%\n28%\n30.0%\n20.0% 12.4% 12.1%\n10.0% 3.7%\n0.0%\nUlaanbaatar Darhan, Rural\n(capital) Erdenet cities\nBanking system XacBank\n \n \n \n \n  16", "Figure 5 \nPortfolio segmentation \nBorrowers by type, 2003 Loan portfolio by purpose, 2003\nCrop\nHerders\n1%\n1% Others Livestock Other Mixed\n0% 0.8% 13% 1%\n Salaried\npeople Financial lease\nService\n48%  Small or 7% 0.4%\n informal\nProduction\nbusiness\n10%\n49%\nTrade\nConsumption 46%\nSMEs 21%\n2%\n \n \n \nWith the increasing competition in the financial sector and rapid growth of MFIs in urban \nareas, XacBank is feeling the pressure to expand its outreach into rural areas, especially to \nsmall farmers and herder families beyond aimag centers. Having attracted significant social \ninvestment, XacBank also feels the pressure to demonstrate its commitment to serving \ncommunities with little or no access to financial services in rural remote areas. \n \nTraditional branch offices are established at the aimag center level. With an exception of \nthree large soums, there is no branch operation at the soum level primarily due to the limited \neconomies of scale, high transaction cost, limited connection to transfer transaction data and \nlack of qualified human resources to serve as a bank staff.13 In order to break even, it is \nestimates that a branch needs a population of at least 10-20 thousand. Yet, a typical soum has \na population of 2500 people, of whom 600 are potential borrowers. Average soum is 150 km far \naway from the aimag (province) center.  \n \nIn order to extend its financial services to the rural remote areas, XacBank is experimenting with \ntwo innovative approaches. They are described below.  \n \nFranchise model \n \nIn order to reach clients in soums where opening a full-fledged branch office is not \njustified economically, XacBank believes a local savings and credit cooperative (SCC) is the \nmost feasible option. SCCs are important partners for expanding microfinance outreach as have \na base in the local community and potentially have low administrative costs. However to \nbecome an effective outreach strategy in rural areas, limitations of SCCs need to be addressed: \nsuch as weak governance, limited financial management skills, and lack of experience in \ndemand-driven product development. To address these limitations intensive capacity building is \nnecessary at least at the beginning. XacBank has chosen to use a franchise model to support \nlocal SCCs as a vehicle to extend its financial services to rural remote areas.  \n                                                 \n13 Exceptions: three branches are opened at soum level because they are equal to aimag center in terms of market \nsize, infrastructure development, likelihood to have a larger population concentration and ability to meet the outreach \nplan required for a branch office. \n  17", " \nBy using SCCs as its franchisees, XacBank will not need to establish fully-fledged \nbranch offices in remote areas. Instead, the existing branch offices at the aimag (province) \ncenters will provide monitoring and supervision, review financial statements and portfolio reports \n(similar to internal audit), and provide advice and guidance. On the other hand, the franchise \nSCC will review and approve loan applications on its own independent of XacBank branch staff. \nThe SCC has an advantage in terms of having information on the behavior of potential clients \nand their capacity to absorb credit as well as enforcing loan repayment through informal \nmechanisms, such as peer pressure and a close follow up.  \n  \nThe start-up cost for establishing a franchise includes the salary and per diem for three \nstaff persons for 5 days in the field: after this first time, the visits will be for two days once a \nquarter. Four days are spent on training and a local SCC, which is interested in becoming a \nXacBank franchise, is expected to start with a total asset of US$2,000. In order to increase the \nloan capital of the franchise, XacBank provides a wholesale loan (initially US$3,000). Usually, \nSCCs want to take more wholesale loans. To give an incentive, XacBank commits to lend 80% \nof the total equity. There are other incentives to increase the equity capital and expand the \nnumber of members.14   \n \nXacBank experience with the franchise model has demonstrated two key difficulties: \n \n(cid:190) Start up cost is high due to intensive capacity building, including promotion, training and \ntechnical assistance in establishing and strengthening the local Savings and Credit \nCooperative who will become the franchise of XacBank. In Mongolia, the cooperative \nmodel is just emerging as a rural development strategy and it requires a national level \neffort to provide extensive support. The franchise model does not break-even in the \nshort run, so there is a need for a subsidy to cover the capacity building costs.  \n(cid:190) Commitment and buy-in from the local community members and key stakeholders is \ncrucial. The final outcomes do not depend on XacBank alone, but also on the \ncommitment and interest of local stakeholders and community members. There are also \nissues of politics, which can influence the running of the co-operative.  \n \nA short pilot of the franchise model has demonstrated that in Mongolia the franchise \nmodel would not be able to break-even within a year. Therefore currently mobile banking is \nbeing used as a transition strategy with a view to eventually introducing franchising after mobile \nbanking breaks-even in a given soum.15  \n \nMobile banking model \n \nXacBank introduced mobile banking as a transition strategy before the franchise model \nbecomes sustainable. There are mobile banking services in 120-130 soums as of September \n2005.16 Most of them are operating profitably. Only those who have started recently (about 2 \nmonths ago) have not yet made a profit. On average, after 5-6 months, a mobile bank breaks \neven. A portfolio of $40,000 in a given soum is a sufficient scale to break even. XacBank is \n                                                 \n14 By law, a minimum number of 20 members are required to form a cooperative.  \n \n15 At the moment, financial projections have been made for up to one year. It is difficult to project beyond one year \nbecause the soum market conditions are not predictable. \n16 In soums where there is no mobile banking, rural people come to receive services from the branch offices at the \naimag center. In total, XacBank is serving people in 170 soums.  \n  18", "currently giving priority to introduce mobile banking in soums with a population of more than \n3,000 with an initial portfolio of $20,000.  \n \nA typical mobile banking crew consists of a driver and two credit officers (one for micro \ncredit and one for SME loans). They travel by a Russian jeep from a branch in an aymag center \nto soums, usually 50-100 km in distance, once or twice a month. During their visit, the mobile \nbanking crew meets the Loan Approval Committee (LAC) members, reviews the loan \napplications (which are received by the LAC members between the visits), evaluates the \ncollateral, makes a final approval of the loans together with the LAC, and disburses the loans. \nSince the loan repayment is scheduled once a month, the mobile bank collects the repayment \nduring their visit. Each visit takes about 1-2 days in each soum.  \n \nA loan approval committee (LAC) is formed at the soum level. It consists of three \nmembers. Criteria for selecting LAC members are: \n \n(cid:190) Age: 40 years or older \n(cid:190) Residency: many years of stable residency in the community \n(cid:190) Work experience: representatives from government agencies (such as school teachers \nand local officials) and representatives of the community  \n(cid:190) Knowledge of and well-respected in the community.  \n \nLAC members are responsible for: \n \n(cid:153) Product promotion \n(cid:153) Distributing loan applications \n(cid:153) Distributing repayment schedule \n(cid:153) Monitoring loan performance \n(cid:153) Collecting late repayments and transfering to the branch through the Agriculture bank \nbranch in the soum (Repayment, if paid on schedule, is collected by the mobile bank.) \n(cid:153)  Receiving loan applications \n(cid:153) Calling and informing the branch about loan applications \n(cid:153) Reviewing loan applications and approving together with the mobile bank crew.  \n \nLAC members are paid based on their portfolio. Below is the current incentive chart: \n \nTable 3 \nIncentive chart for LAC \n \nMonthly salary per LAC \nPortfolio size  member \n $16,597 or \nless    $         12.80 \n $16,598-\n33,195    $         21.30 \n $33,196-\n49,792    $         38.30 \n \nThe total cost for running a mobile banking crew (assuming two visits per month per \nsoum) and hiring LAC members (3 members per soum, assuming anaverage portfolio of \nUSD5652) is estimated to be USD 208 (approximately). It is estimated that using this approach \nXacBank, on average, generates revenue of approximately USD 479 per month (assuming two \n  19", "visits, each approving 20 loans or USD 5,952 in loan portfolio, at an interest rate of 3.1-3.5% per \nmonth, charging 0.5% of the loan amount for loan fee, and a fee of 66 cents per loan application \nform). - \n \nWhile the mobile banking approach appears to be an effective transition strategy, it \nposes a serious challenge regarding the security of the cash carried by the mobile banking unit, \nas the portfolio grows. Also, it is only a temporary strategy because the mobile bank visits any \ngiven soum only once a month, hence offers a limited access to clients. This limited presence in \nthe local areas does not allow XacBank to mobilize savings. As concluded by Hirschland (2003) \neasy access and proximity are considered as one of the most important factors that poor people \nconsider in making decisions on savings. Therefore, XacBank needs to find a solution that will \nallow them to have closer and more convenient access to financial services for the poor at the \nsoum level and beyond, so as to increase its savings mobilization.  Furthermore, in order to exit \nthe mobile banking and transition to the franchise model, XacBank has to find solutions to cut \ndown cost, improve efficiency of staff, and reduce cash transactions. \n \n   The next section explores some promising ICT solutions that may enable XacBank to \nextend its microfinance services to rural remote areas on a sustainable basis.  \nPromising solutions \n \nThis paper started with a premise that MFIs operate with a high ratio of administrative \ncosts per dollar loaned, because (by definition) they make small loans. The cost is even higher \nin servicing rural remote areas. Proper application of ICT can reduce the burdensome \nbookkeeping and administrative cost, improve staff productivity and expand outreach. \nTechnological innovations can significantly increase the efficiency and lower the costs of \nfinancial service providers operating in rural areas (Christen & Pearce, 2005).  Reduction in \ncosts is obtained in two ways \u2013 through lowering per unit costs and higher volume productivity \n(WorldBank, 2005). \n \nGiven these premises, and the review of the available ICT innovations in microfinance \nhere we develop four scenarios as possible solutions for XacBank in extending microfinance \nservices in rural areas of Mongolia  \n \nOption 1: ATMs \u2013 operated as a stand-alone service center \nOption 2: ATMs placed in a Post Office or local XAAN bank branch \nOption 3: Wireless POS devices carried by a mobile banking team \nOption 4: Wireless POS devices placed in a XacBank franchise (local Savings and Credit \nCooperative) \n \nThese ICT solutions take into consideration the problems that XacBank faces in rural \nareas: poor road and communication infrastructure, geographically dispersed clients, and a \nsmall volume of transactions.  \n \nThe implications of these challenges are:  \n \na)  Reaching rural clients is difficult and formal financial institutions reach those \nclosest to the urban centers \nb)  Close monitoring of the lending portfolio by financial institutions is difficult \nc)  Mobilizing small savings is impossible without regular access \n \n  20", "Furthermore, the interviews with key stakeholders in Mongolia and customers of \nXacBank helped to fine tune the identification of appropriate ICT solutions and the possible \nissues that need to be addressed in implementing them.  \n \nThe key expected outcomes of these ICT solutions are:  \n \nExpanding the access points: By leveraging technology solutions such as POS devices and \nATMs, a microfinance institution can extend access to their services in rural areas by creating \nflexible, far-reaching delivery channels.  \n \nImproving efficiency:  By using technology to streamline microfinance operations, an \ninstitution could reduce the time required to disburse loans from 5 to 2 days, which translates \ninto a 40 percent increase in the number of loans disbursed.  \n \nStrengthening risk management: Technology enables institutions to collect data in electronic \nformat that can be synthesized and analyzed to identify trends, such as delinquency or yields, \nassess individual creditworthiness through payment histories, and develop scoring models and \npotentially insurance products. \n \n \nAnalysis of four ICT solutions  \n \nThere are two options for operating ATMs in rural soums of Mongolia: \n1)  Operating as a stand-alone service center \n2)  Placing it in a Post office or XAAN bank branch. \n \nStand-alone: When placed as a stand-alone service center either outside or inside a building, \nATMs can replace the need for an office or field staff, but require a strong security system and \ngood instructions for customers to follow. In most cases, ATMs have not been operated as a \nstand-alone due to these two requirements. Rural clients will likely need customer service to \nguide them how to use ATMs. Therefore, XacBank will have to have at least one or two staff \npersons. Also, there is a need to have a physical building to house the ATM. \n \nPost-office or XAAN bank branch: In many countries post offices have been traditionally \nfavored by poorer people but have lost custom due to poor customer service, poor products and \nmanual procedures. In Mongolia, there is a post-office branch in every rural soums. However, \nthe post-offices serve as a branch of Post Bank, which is a major competitor of XacBank. While \nat present they do not have well-developed microfinance products, Post Bank is planning to \nenter the lower end market and is aggressively recruiting expertise in developing microfinance \nproducts. Another option is XAAN bank branches in rural soums. XAAN bank has a branch \ninfrastructure in every rural soum. It will be to the benefit of both XAAN bank and XacBank to \npartner and share the cost of using ATM to offer a wide range of services. However, past \nexperience of XacBank with XAAN bank has been rather unpromising in terms of partnership, \nas they see each other as direct competitors.  \n \nConsidering the challenges with ATMs, two other options are identified using POS \ntechnology. As described in the previous section, the full service channel model of POS \ntechnology is the most promising solution. To operate such a model, XacBank will need a third \nparty to provide customer services, handle transactions, perform loan appraisal and follow up \nfunctions. As we have seen two possibilities have been consdered to perform these functions: \none is a mobile banking unit of XacBank and the other is a XacBank franchise.  \n  21", " \nA simple ranking approach is used to compare these four solutions and assess which is \nmost feasible and appropriate given the unique characteristics and challenges of the local \ncontext within which XacBank has to operate. In total, seven categories are used to rank the \nfour solutions: three of them relate to client preferences and four of them relate to institutional \npreferences. These categories were identified based on the literature review and interviews with \nkey stakeholders in Mongolia.17 The following table provides an outline of the ranking results of \neach ICT solution by each category from the perspective of both clients and institutions \n \nTable 4 \nSimple Ranking of ICT solutions \n \n  ATMs \u2013  ATMs placed in  Wireless POS  Wireless POS \noperated as a  Post Office or  devices placed in  devices carried \nstand-alone  local XAAN  local Savings and  by a mobile \nservice center  bank branch  Credit Cooperatives,  banking \n    a XacBank franchise  \nClients:         \nAccessibility  ****  **  ***  * \nFeatures/service  *  **  ***  **** \nfunctions \nEase of use  *  **  ***  **** \nMFI:         \nCost  *  ***  ****  ** \nBuilding volume  **  ****  ***  * \nLiquidity  *  ****  **  *** \nRequirements for  *  **  ***  **** \ncommunication \ninfrastructure \nTotal score  11 (4th)  19 (2nd)  22 (1st)  19 (3rd) \n(Ranking) \nNote * denotes one point score \n \n \nAccessibility:  \n \nUse of ATM has the potential to provide accessible, convenient financial services \nbecause it no longer requires bricks and mortar operated by the permanent staff of a financial \ninstitution. However, due to security and infrastructure development in a given area, the actual \napplications of ATM differ in terms of location and accessibility. Not every ATM implemented by \nMFIs offer 24-hour service, as expected.  \n \nIf the ATM were to be placed in a post office or a branch office of XAAN bank, the \naccess will be limited to the office hours of Post Office and XAAN bank. They usually operate \nfrom 9am to 4pm.  \n \n                                                 \n17Two references are particularly useful,  Cracknell, (2004) and Waterfield, (2004). \n  22", "However, the above two options are better than carrying POS terminals in a mobile \nbanking unit because it visits a given soum only once a month. Therefore, it is the least \naccessible option.  \n \nOn the other hand, if a POS terminal is placed in a franchise of XacBank (SCC), rural \nclients will have better access, though not 24 hours. In general, local SCCs have longer \noperating hours than the post office and the XAAN bank branch. \n \nFeatures/service functions:  \n \nWhen utilized fully, ATMs and POS devices offer a wide range of services: Withdrawal, \nCashing Pre-approved loans, Deposits, Money transfer and Account inquiry. However, in many \ncountries, ATMs provide only limited functions due to the acceptability of local currency notes, \nsecurity of cash and so on. Also, the cost of an ATM depends on how many functions it can \nprovide. Thus, most financial institutions start only with the basic function, that is to disburse \ncash.  \n \nHowever, if a POS terminal is carried by the mobile banking unit, there may be wider \nrange of functions offered since there will be staff, who will operate it. For instance, there may \nbe a possibility to not only disburse pre-approved loans and withdraw cash but also to make \ndeposits, transfer funds and enquire about account balance. Also, POS terminals are generally \ncheaper even with additional functions. When the POS terminal is left with the local franchise, \nsome of these functions may not be made available due to the limited capacity of a local \nfranchise staff and security issues of cash handling by the franchise staff. In the case of an ATM \nmachine in a post-office or XAAN bank branch, again there will be limited functions due to the \npossible reluctance by the staff of these agencies to collect deposits and provide other \nadditional services on behalf of XacBank who is considered as a competitor.  \n \n \nEase of use \u2013 convenience:  \n \nSystems should be simple to use, fast and user friendly. Service should be standardized \nso that wherever the solution is used the customer is familiar with the procedure followed. \nCustomers should have ready sources of advice, whether this is through call centers, through \npublicity or through physical presence. Also, the screen and the buttons should be in the local \nlanguage. \n \nWhen a ATM machine is operating as a stand-alone service center, there will be no staff \nperson to provide an assistance. Therefore, it is likely to be the least convenient in terms of \nease of use. On the other hand, if a POS terminal is operated by a mobile banking staff of \nXacBank, the staff person is likely to have received training on how to operate it and will \nconduct transactions on behalf of clients by operating the POS terminal. Placing the POS \nterminal in the XacBank franchise will also be a relatively easier to use option than an ATM \nplaced in the post office or XAAN bank branch, because the franchise staff will have received \ntraining from Xacbank, though may not be as good as the Xacbank branch staff, and also, the \nPOS terminals are much easier to operate than ATM machine.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  23", "From an institutional perspective: \n \nCost: \n \nIf XacBank were to operate ATM machines as a stand-alone service center, it will bear \nthe full cost of purchasing and maintaining them, hence this will be the most expensive option. If \nit were to partner with XAAN bank or the post office, they can share the cost, hence this will be \na less expensive option. The cost will be cheapest if XacBank were to place a POS terminal in \nits franchise office and share the cost, since a POS terminal is much less expensive than an \nATM machine. Carrying a POS terminal in a mobile bank unit is more expensive because there \nis no cost sharing. \n \nBuilding volume:  \n \nOne way to reduce the cost burden on the institution is to achieve economies of scale by \nbuilding more volume of transactions. Using a POS terminal with mobile banking will have the \nleast chance for building volume, since it will be used only once a month when the mobile bank \nvisits a soum.  \n \nAn ATM housed at a post office or XAAN bank branch will be able to build up the most \nvolume by serving customers of both partners and providing a wider range of services.  \nOperating a POS from XacBank\u2019s franchise office may not be able to achieve as much volume, \nbut more than an ATM placed as a stand-alone due to the reasons mentioned, such as the \nlimited functions and difficulties customers may face in operating the machine without human \ninstructions. \n \nLiquidity:  \n \nOne of the major problems in using an ATM or POS is liquidity. Due to the great distance \nfrom a branch office and poor road infrastructure, it will be hard for XacBank staff to charge the \nmachines with cash, especially if the ATM is operated as a stand-alone. A POS placed at a \nfranchise may also face the same difficulty due to a limited volume of transactions, especially if \nthey are a small SCC and have few members to begin with. On the other hand, a post office or \nXAAN bank branch will be the best option in this respect because they handle most transactions \nin a given soum; as all state benefits, pensions, salaries, money transfers and subscriptions to \nnewspapers go through these local offices. A POS terminal carried by a mobile banking unit will \nhave somewhat less difficulty with liquidity due to their ability to tap into cash at the branch \noffice in a provincial center. However, when they travel a long distance without sufficient \nsecurity, they have to be careful about carrying a large sum of cash.  \n \nRequirement for communication infrastructure \n \nAs was mentioned earlier, communication infrastructure is a must requirement for \noperating any of these ICT innovations. Rural soums in Mongolia do not have connectivity. The \nonly means of communication is phone by a land line. Operating ATM as a stand-alone will be \nthe most challenging. Xacbank will have to find a way to establish a connection through a phone \nline using a dial-up service, if that is available. If housed at a post office or XAAN bank branch, \nan ATM may have a better chance to get access to a connection because these outlets already \nhave some communication infrastructure in place, alhough this may be poor and irregular.  \n \n  24", "The best solution in this case is to use wireless POS terminals that can be operated with smart \ncards (chip based). As explained earlier, smart cards can store transaction data offline. After a \ncertain number of transactions, the data has to be uploaded. In this respect, the wireless POS \nusing smart cards carried in the mobile banking unit is the most feasible.  \n \nBased on the above seven categories of clients\u2019 and institutional preferences, the most \ndesirable option is placing a POS terminal in a XacBank franchise (SCC). In order to ensure \nsuccessful implementation, it is important to take into consideration the current state of ICT \ndeployment in the financial sector in the country, the supply of hardware and software, the \nregulatory environment and the experiences of clients with these new technologies.  \n \nCurrent state of ICT in the financial sector in Mongolia \n \nDuring 1998-2001, with support from the Asian Development Bank, all regulated \nfinancial institutions converted their general ledger systems into a new system based on a \nWindows environment. Also, they all got online connection for their management information \nsystems. As a result, all banks have started exploring technological advancements for further \nimprovements in their systems and product offerings.  \n \nOne of the most recent developments is the introduction of a card system. Currently, \nthere are three networks issuing credit and debit cards: Anod bank, Golomt bank and Trade and \nDevelopment Bank (TDB). Each of them issues their own credit and debit cards. All the \ncommercial banks in Mongolia are using POS terminals and cards issued by one of these three \nbanks. However, the cards issued by one network are not compatible with the other networks. In \nother words, POS terminals of Golomt bank do not recognize the cards issued by TDB or Anod \nbank. Some merchants had to install three different POS terminals in order to make sure they \nwill be able to serve all customers regardless of which bank issued their cards. If they do not \nhave POS terminals of all three networks, they will not be able to serve customers who have \ncards issued by a bank whose POS terminal is not installed. This causes inconvenience for \ncustomers and raises the cost for both merchants and banks. In a country of 2.7 million people \n(of whom, only a fraction currently uses a banking card), it is not economical to have three \nindependent networks.  \n  \nIn response, the Bank of Mongolia (BoM) has recently set up a national Clearing and \nSwitching Center (CSC). The main purpose of this center is to consolidate the independent \nnetworks and provide one channel for processing all card transactions. Once the CSC is in full \noperation in 2006, all 17 banks will be linked to this center. All the three individual POS \nnetworks will all go to this one switch clearing center. All cards can be processed through this \ncenter.  \n \nOne of the challenges on the agenda for CSC is the connectivity in rural areas. Within \neach financial institution, data is transferred to the head office from branch offices. Limited \naccess to online connection interrupts reliable and timely data transfer between the branches, \nwhich in turn affects the data transfer to the central CSC from the financial institution. To \naddress this issue, CSC is examining the feasibility of wireless POS. There are two \ntechnologies for wireless POS. One of them, WiFi, can be used within a 50 km radius. At the \ntime of the field research, this wireless POS was being piloted.  This POS device uses a chip \ncard, which can store up to 1000 transactions off-line. Then, wireless connectivity is used to \ntransfer the data once the chip card has stored up to 1000 transactions. CSC will issue its own \n  25", "smart cards. The software that will process the smart cards will be able to store transaction data \noff-line.  \n \nUse of POS \n \nThe sector respondents interviewed in this study envisioned that in three years all banks \nwould have their own cards and all trade and shopping centers will have POS terminals to read \ncards. All salaries will be deposited directly into accounts, which can be accessed by cards. \n \nCurrently, mostly banks have bought POS terminals to install in their branches. After this \nstage, the clients will start to demand merchants to do transactions through POS. Maybe in 3-5 \nyears, merchants will start to buy POS terminals. Initially, banks will start installing them in \nmerchant\u2019s places. In the second stage, when the number of customers with cards grows into a \nsignificant scale, merchants will start to buy terminals themselves. Currently, there is no \napplication of a card system in rural areas, except some bank branch offices at the provincial \ncenter level.  \n \nRegulatory issues \n \nAt the time of the field research, there is no regulatory requirement in terms of what \ninfrastructure has to be in place before introducing an ATM or POS. Financial institutions are \nallowed to choose merchants and evaluate the potential risks. BoM only examines what \nrequirements are in place for selecting merchants and whether they have been complied. \nHowever, there is a need for improvements in the regulatory environment in order to ensure \nsound implementation of ICT solutions in financial services: \n  \n\u2022  Contractual agreements need to be made with financial institutions and merchants.  \n\u2022  A more carefully thought regulation is necessary for protecting consumer privacy and \nconfidentiality of data. BoM needs to review the policies and procedures in place for \nconsumer protection and confidentiality.  \n\u2022  BoM has to examine technical adequacy (for example in relation to level of computerization \nand the adequacy of Management Information Systems) when granting a licenses to Banks \nand Non-Banking financial institutions.  \n \nAt present, the BoM carries out no assessment of the potential risks which are \nheightened due to the use of ICT, whether transaction, credit, compliance or strategic risk. \n \nSupply of hardware and software \n \nThere is no local capacity to develop software for ATM and POS. BeverTech is the only \nprivate company that supplies hardware for POS terminals as an official dealer of an \ninternational supplier.18 It was founded in 2003, and has developed a partnership with a \nCanadian supplier as its official dealer.19 The main products offered by BeverTech include: \n \n                                                 \n18 There are few other smaller companies which sell POS terminals, but they are not the exclusive dealer of any \ninternational supplier and the size of their transactions is small.  \n19 The founder of the company had worked in DataCom, one of the two main internet service providers in Mongolia. \nShe has a strong experience in IT and has been interested in applying IT for financial services.  Her first product was \ninternet banking model, which was developed while she was working in DataCom. \n  26", "- Internet Banking: In 1990, the first internet banking model was developed and introduced to \nCapital Bank, a commercial bank, in partnership with InterActive, a local software developer.  \nInterActive had experience in developing accounting software. It took two years to develop the \ncomplete banking system. Now, all the branches of Capital Bank are using this system. The \npackage includes all financial management information system, as well as internet and phone \nbanking software. Total cost was $35,000-40,000. Maintenance is separate: based on need.  \n \n- POS system: It will take a lot of time to develop the software locally. Therefore, the company is \nexploring a possibility to purchase an international package and modify to the local context. The \nplan is to acquire the right to modify and customize the international package locally. At the time \nof field research, BeverTech had obtained the exclusive right to sell the hardware of VeriFone, a \nUS-based company. The Bank of Mongolia was the first client to purchase these POS terminals. \nThe purchase price for commercial banks is about $350 (for the one that requires a phone line - \nDial or local network - LAN) and $580 (dial up or wireless connection like cell phone).20 It \nincludes training, installation, device, support, and warranty. BeverTech provides training to \nbank staff on basic maintenance and repair of the hardware. Maintenance support is free during \nthe installation. The technical warranty is one year. Technical support after installation is around \n$5-10 per visit. Banks have to cover the costs of communication, printer and stationary. In terms \nof communication, if they use their existing LAN connection, there is no additional cost. If they \nuse a dial up or wireless connection through a cell phone, there will be an additional cost for \ncommunications.  \n \nATM: There is only one commercial bank that has an ATM network. The hardware and software \nwere purchased from a Russian company. Currently, these ATMs do not accept deposits due to \nthe fact that Mongolian national currency is not recognized in the international network of ATM \nmanufacturers. BeverTech does not think any individual company will be able to sponsor the \nprocess of getting the local currency recognized. The price of the existing ATM was around \n$60,000.  \n \nInfrastructure \n \nAs noted already one of the major challenges in bringing in new technology solutions to \nrural areas is poor infrastructure. In particular, in many rural soums \n \n(cid:190)  it is not possible to send a fax and or to have an email connection (phone connection \nis poor quality).  \n(cid:190) roads are not well maintained, if they exist at all,  \n(cid:190) power supplies are limited  \n \nIn terms of communications infrastructure, currently, both the private sector and the \ngovernment are working to improve connectivity in rural areas. In particular, three options are \nbeing explored: \n \n1)  Cable Optic \n2)  Satellite antenna (wireless) \n3)  Leased line.  \n \n                                                 \n20 The price for a simple POS terminal (Vx510) supplied by other smaller companies is quoted as $600 (one with dial \nup and LAN). Nobody is selling wireless POS.  \n  27", "Each of these has advantages and disadvantages. Banks usually use a combination of \nthese three for connectivity depending on the location of branches, the availability of a leased \nline and the cost of a given option.   \n \nThe least expensive is a leased line. However, the leased line is possible only if the \ndistance between the two sites is between 2.5 and 3.5 kilometers (km). Also, if the underground \nis full and there is no room for launching an additional line, then a satellite antenna is the only \noption. The limitation with the satellite antenna is that the two connecting sites must be able to \nsee each other. Usually, a connection through satellite antenna is possible when the distance is \nno more than 20 km. If it is more than 20 km, it is possible to connect via a VSAT antenna, but it \nis much more expensive.  \n \nTable 5 \nCost estimates of infrastructure for online connection \n \nConnection options  One-time cost  Re-occurring cost \nCable optic  $3000-4000 per km   \nLeased line  $50 for up to 500 meter  $0.20 per meter/per month \nSatellite antenna  $1400 for one antenna  Do not know \nVSAT antenna  $13,000 (approx.)  $300 per month \n \n \nIn terms of coverage, at the time of field research, all banks online were using one of the \nabove three main channels. However, the connectivity in rural areas was still poor. A \nrepresentative of one of the main communication companies in Mongolia reported that: \u201cCost is \ntoo high to provide an internet service in rural areas by establishing infrastructure on our own \ndue to the small scale of rural market demand. It is only worthwhile in major urban areas.\u201d He \nfurther stated that some subsidy is required for developing infrastructure in rural areas. However, \nprevious experience with an infrastructure development project that was subsidized by the \nSoros Foundation indicates that more thought should be given for the sustainability of \ninfrastructure maintenance. The start-up cost of the project was paid for by the Soros \nFoundation. It was agreed that the local government would cover the on-going maintenance \ncost by paying a monthly fee to the internet service provider. However, the local government \nfailed to pay the monthly fee, so the internet service discontinued.  \n \nIt became obvious from the interviews with private sector internet service providers that \nthe private sector will not invest in creating infrastructure in rural areas. Their main suggestion \nfor expanding the coverage in rural areas was that the government should install optic cables \nand lease them to private service providers. While this may be a promising approach, the \nnumber of years it will take to finally provide reliable internet connection in rural areas remains \nunanswered.  \n \nVoices of customers \n \nA total of 8 customers were interviewed. The sampling was based on a snow-ball \ntechnique.21 All of them were XacBank customers. In addition, some of them had banking \nrelationship with other financial institutions. Of the eight customers interviewed, three had had \nexperience using a debit card: one of them had a card issued by Golomt bank, one by Trade \n                                                 \n21 Customers who were waiting in the banking hall while their loan applications were reviewed, were invited for an \ninterview. There was no refused case. It was in the banking hall of XacBank in the afternoon during a work day.   \n  28", "and Development Bank (TDB) and one by XacBank (which is in the same network as Golomt \nbank). All three card users acquired their cards due to their employers\u2019 arrangement with the \nrespective banks for direct deposit of their monthly salaries. According to the interviewees, the \nadvantages of using a card, as opposed to cash, included greater security, increased savings, \nfaster service, improved access and faster money transfer. Disadvantages included some \ndelays in accessing card accounts, and the incompatibility of cards at POS terminals. \nCustomers not yet having a card raised concerns over account security and privacy and the \ndifficulty of remembering pin numbers for ATM machines. \n \nConclusions \n \nWhile microfinance has been embraced as an effective poverty reduction strategy, many \npoor people in rural areas have still been left behind with limited access to financial services. \nThe main problems include poor infrastructure, low density, remoteness and dependency on \nagriculture, all of which increase transaction costs and make them less profitable. The rapidity \nwith which advancements of information and communication technology are taking place \npresents many unique opportunities in expanding access to financial services in rural areas.  \n \nIn terms of recent experience in Mongolia both stable supply of power and reliable, lower cost \nconnectivity are essential for ensuring uninterrupted transactions. In Mongolia, like many other \ndeveloping countries, there is a very poor connectivity in remote areas, though it is improving in \nmore urban areas. In order to implement any of the ICT innovations, a MFI must have \naddressed this issue. However, in the case of our suggested ICT solution, a wireless POS \ndevice using smart card does not require real-time connection. The smart card can store up to \n1000 transactions offline. After that, the data has to be uploaded. \n \nEven if the infrastructure is ready, the obvious question would be whether the potential scale of \ncustomers is large enough to ensure a critical mass for the economic viability of providing e-\nbanking. XacBank needs to find ways to build up volume using the POS device in its franchise. \nOne solution is perhaps building in additional services, such as allowing members of SCC to \nuse their cards for purchasing goods and selling their produce through the POS device placed \nat the SCC. Also, allowing non-members to conduct transactions using the POS device will help \nincreasing economies of scale. Partnering with other financial institutions and merchants in the \nlocal soum would also be desirable.  \n \nThe success of implementing the suggested ICT solution is dependent on the institution\u2019s ability \nto develop and institute a marketing plan which will attract sufficient numbers of users to justify \nthe new system. There must be a clear understanding of who are the potential users. In the \ncase of the proposed solution, the direct customers will be small scale herders and micro-\nenterpreneurs who live in and around soum centers in the rural areas of Mongolia. Other users \nwill be merchants, partners and other financial institutions.  \n \nMore generally, while ICT offers considerable potential in delivering financial services in \nrural areas, the number of microfinance institutions that have actually implemented ICT \nsolutions is still very limited. This raises the question why MFIs are not taking up ICT \napplications as rapidly as expected? Our analysis suggests a few basic lessons for MFIs, \ndonors and governments: \n \n(cid:190) ITC is worth the investment only or for A critical mass. Initiatives have emerged and are \nmore or less successful in countries with dense population (India, the Philippines). Countries \n  29", "with lower density may need to look for other options, or seek partnerships both within the \ncountry and within the region.   \n \n(cid:190) Regulation matters. In order to make full use of ATMs and POS devices, an institution \nmust have a license to accept deposits. For savings, if a merchant is not allowed to accept \ndeposits, then the merchant can not act as the intermediary for placing POS of MFIs.   \n \n(cid:190) Careful cost benefit analysis is necessary. To assess whether or not investment in ICT \nwill be worth the investment, it is important to analyze costs and benefits and compare with \nother alternative strategies. \n \n(cid:190) Financial education will make a big difference. Initially, customers have a psychological \nbarrier in using a new technology. Even merchants have a fear and try to avoid serving \npeople with a payment card. If the printer gets jammed and does not produce the receipts, \nthey do not know how to fix it. Education and training is critical to make it easier for \ncustomers and merchants learn how to use new technologies in financial services. It is \nimportant to remove the fear that it is complicated. Promotional campaigns should \ndemonstrate that it is simple to operate the POS terminals.  \n \n(cid:190) Technology cannot be a complete substitute for a delivery mechanism. It can work as \na supplement to delivery mechanisms by reducing cost, fraud and improving staff \nproductivity. Customers, especially at the lower end market, still prefer human interaction. \nAlso, there are some functions such as a loan appraisal and approval that still need to be \nconducted by staff. \n \n(cid:190) Appropriate ICT solutions are context-specific. ICT applications that have been \nsuccessful in other countries do not necessarily work in any country. The importance of the \nenabling environment cannot be underestimated.  \n \n(cid:190) Increase the network of points for using the card: If all traders and service providers \nintroduce a card system, all customers will buy the card. It is because not all merchants and \nretailers accept cards, there is less incentive for customers to use card as a means of \npayment.  \n \n(cid:190) ICT is no panacea: There are many services poor people in rural areas need in order to \nmove out of poverty. ICT solutions cannot address all the challenges that contribute to rural \npoverty. For example, poor farmers and herders lack collateral and suffer from a systematic \nrisk due to their dependency on agriculture and seasonal income generating activities. \nThese are not fully addressed by the use of ICT. Other supplementary measures are \nnecessary to comprehensively address rural poverty.  \n \n  30", "Appendix 1 \nList of people interviewed \n \nFinancial institutions \n \nXacBank \nL.
