INTRODUCTION \nThe purpose of this paper is to analyze the role of the service sector in structural \nadjustment  and  economic  growth  in  Asia.  The  paper  empirically  investigates  the \nhistorical experience of Asian economies and explores a scenario of more rapid catch-\nup of service sector productivity growth over the coming decades for Asian economies.  \nIn the era of industrialization since World War II, major Asian economies, including \nJapan,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  and  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  have \nundergone spectacular economic transformations\u2015fast economic growth and major \nemployment  shifts  from  the  agriculture  sector  to  the  manufacturing  sector.  The \nmanufacturing sector has been a key engine of growth over this period. This rapid \nindustrialization has been supported by high savings and investment rates and export-\noriented  policies.  In  recent  decades,  however,  the  pace  of  output  growth  in  the \nindustrialized  East  Asian  economies  has  slowed  significantly.  Japan  and  newly \nindustrialized economies (NIEs) in Asia that had experienced fast growth began to \ngrow less rapidly over time as the gap between their per capita incomes and that of the \nUS  narrowed.  A  number  of  factors,  including  slower  labor  force  growth,  lower \ninvestment  rates,  declining  rates  of  return  to  investment,  and  sluggish  technology \nadvancement have been highlighted as major causes of the \u201cgrowth deceleration.\u201d \nAnother salient feature in East Asia\u2019s growth is the rise of service industries with major \nemployment shifts toward the service sector. The well-established empirical stylized \nfact shows that there is a positive relationship between the share of services in GDP \n(or total employment) and GDP per capita (Clark 1957; Chenery 1960). More recently, \nEichengreen and Gupta (2012) argue that the relationship is not linear, following two \ndistinct \u201cwave\u201d patterns of service sector growth. In the first wave, the service share in \noutput and employment rises with GDP per capita at a decelerating rate. The service \nshare rises again in the second wave at a higher income level. They argue that the first \nwave features the rise of traditional services while incomes are still low, while the \nsecond wave features modern services including post and communications, financial \nintermediation, computer, and business services.  \nHow  does  the  rise  in  the  service  sector  contribute  to  overall  growth  in  Asian \neconomies? As an economy grows, the service sector becomes larger and hence \noverall growth depends more on the performance of the service sector. Thus, the \nservice sector\u2019s contribution to overall growth tends to become proportionally larger \nwith economic development and expansion of the service sector. However, if labor \nproductivity growth of the service sector is lower than that of the industrial sector, the \nincrease in the size of the service sector with deindustrialization can have a harmful \neffect on overall output growth. \nThe literature presents a number of theories that attempt to explain the change in the \nservice sector share and its implication to overall economic growth. Structural change \ncan be driven by both demand and supply-side factors. The seminal paper by Baumol \n(1967) presents a model of \u201cunbalanced growth,\u201d in which higher productivity growth in \nthe \u201cprogressive\u201d (manufacturing) sector than in the \u201cstagnant\u201d (service) sector causes \nshifts of labor from manufacturing to service industries and shows that aggregate \noutput growth slows down over time as the sector with the lower productivity growth \nexpands. \nRecent papers by Ngai and Pissarides (2007) and Acemoglu and Guerrieri (2008) \ndevelop multisector growth models motivated by Baumol. These models imply that total \nfactor productivity or factor proportion differences generate employment shifts to the \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490                              Lee and McKibbin \n \n\u201cstagnant\u201d (service) sector over the (non)-balanced growth path. Another strand of \nliterature including Laitner (2000); Kogsamut, Rebelo, and Xie (2001); and Foellmi and \nZweimuller (2008) rely on a demand side explanation for structural change.1  \nThis  paper  uses  an  empirically  based  global  intertemporal  multisector  general \nequilibrium  model  (a  large  scale  DSGE  model)  to  explore  what  happens  if  labor \nproductivity rises in the service sector in individual Asian economies and then across \nall Asian economies at the same time. The model allows for consideration of inter-\nindustry input\u2013output linkages, factor movements, and consumption and investment \ndynamics. The model also incorporates spillovers across the border through trade and \nfinancial linkages. The results show that enhancing productivity in the service sector \ncan play a major role as a new growth engine leading to Asia\u2019s strong and sustainable \ngrowth in the long run. Labor moves out of the service sector in the longer run but the \nadjustment across the other non-service sectors in the short run depends on a range of \nfactors. These include the characteristics of each sector (in terms of factor inputs and \ndemand bundles), and what happens to aggregate investment and consumption in an \neconomy and the sectoral composition of that spending and the effects of productivity \ngrowth on the real exchange rate through inflows of global capital, which temporally \nhurt the competitiveness of trade-exposed sectors. The story is quite complex in the \ndecades following a new productivity surge, but in the longer term the outcome is \nbroadly similar to the Ngai and Pissarides (2007) and Acemoglu and Guerrieri (2008) \nadjustment story.  \nA number of recent papers focus on analyzing the patterns of structural change and \neconomic growth experiences of the major East Asian economies such as Japan and \nthe emerging Asian economies (ADB 2012; Buera and Kaboski 2012; Uy, Yi, and \nZhang 2013). However, as far as we are aware, no paper has explicitly focused on \ninvestigating  the  short-run  adjustment  and  the  long-run  implications  of  expanding \nservice sector productivity growth on overall economic growth in Asia.  \nThis paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data and analyzes the stylized \npatterns  in  structural  change  and  convergence  of  labor  productivity  in  the  Asian \neconomies. We also adopt the technique of shift-share analysis to investigate the role \nof service sector productivity growth in overall economic growth. Section 3 uses the \nempirical results on historical productivity experience in Asia as exogenous inputs into \na large-scale intertemporal general equilibrium model of the global economy. Given this \nfuture baseline, we then explore different future scenarios of service sector productivity \ngrowth in Asia, and examine how these affect Asian economies individually and the \nspillovers within Asia and throughout the world. Section 4 provides some concluding \nobservations. \n2.  STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION AND ECONOMIC \nGROWTH IN ASIA \nIn this section, we document the patterns of structural transformation, focusing on \nchanges  in  the  share  of  services  in  total  output  and  employment  in  major  Asian \neconomies.  \n                                                \n1 See Herrendorf, Rogerson, and Valentinyi (2013) for a literature survey. \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490                              Lee and McKibbin \n \n2.1  Data and Sample \nOur  data  are  from  the  Groningen  Growth  Developing  Centre  (GGDC)  10-sector \ndatabase, which provides annual data on value added (at both current and constant \nprices) and employment data from 1970 to 2005 (Timmer and de Vries 2007). The \nGGDC data provides disaggregated data consisting of 10 sectors, as defined by the \nISIC  Revision  2.  The  data  covers  10  Asian  economies:  Japan,  four  Asian  NIEs \n(Republic  of  Korea;  Taipei,China;  Singapore;  and  Hong  Kong,  China),  ASEAN-4 \n(Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand), and India.  \nWe have expanded the sample by adding the PRC, using data compiled by McMillian \nand Rodrik (2011). We have also added the United States (US) as the reference \ncountry, for which data is available from the GGDC 10-sector database.  \nWe aggregate the original data into nine sectors by combining community, social, and \npersonal services with government services. The service sector consists of four service \nbranches: wholesale and retail trade; hotels and restaurants; transport, storage, and \ncommunications;  finance,  insurance,  real  estate,  and  business  services;  and \ncommunity, social, personal, and government services. \nWe focus on the sample period from 1990 to 2005 because data on PRC industries are \navailable from 1990. \n2.2  Pattern of Structural Change \nFigure  1  summarizes  changes  in  sectoral  employment  shares  for  the  agriculture, \nmanufacturing, and service sectors. The vertical axis is the share of employment in \n1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005 in 11 major Asian economies and the US. The horizontal \naxis is the log of GDP per worker in 2000 international dollars. Figure 2 summarizes \nthe change in sectoral value added in current prices.2  \nThe figures confirm the stylized patterns of structural change in the previous studies \n(and the survey by Herrendorf, Rogerson, and Valentinyi [2013]). Increase in GDP per \ncapita  is  associated  with  decreases  in  employment  and  value  added  shares  for \nagriculture, and increases in employment and value added shares for services. The \nmanufacturing employment and value added shares show hump-shaped changes.3 \nIt is clear that there have been major employment shifts toward the service sector in 11 \nmajor Asian economies over the period 1990\u20132005. In Japan, the share of employment \nin the service sector increased from 57.4% in 1990 to 67.1% in 2000, while it increased \nmore dramatically in the Republic of Korea from 46.2% to 64.4% over the same period. \nThe employment share of the service sector in the PRC also increased steadily over \nthe period from 19.9% to 32.6%. \n \n                                                \n2 The patterns are similar for the value added shares with real values. \n3 Uy, Yi, and Zhang (2013) present an open economy model in which the declining portion of the hump is \nnot well explained.  \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490                              Lee and McKibbin \n \nFigure 1: Sector Shares of Employment for 11 Asian Economies and the United \nStates, 1990\u20132005 \n(%) \n \n \n \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Authors\u2019 illustration based on Groningen Growth and Development Centre 10-Sector Database. \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490                              Lee and McKibbin \n \nFigure 2: Sector Shares of Value Added for 11 Asian Economies and the United \nStates, 1990\u20132005 \n(%) \n \n \n \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Authors\u2019 illustration based on Groningen Growth and Development Centre 10-Sector Database. \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490                              Lee and McKibbin \n \nThe figures for the employment share and value added share of services suggest that \nthere is an acceleration in the rate of increase of around 9.5 in the log of GDP per \nworker, consistent with the evidence in Buera and Kaboski (2012) and Eichengreen \nand Gupta (2012).  \n2.3  Convergence of Sectoral Labor Productivity \nWe assess whether convergence in labor productivity at the aggregate economy and \nsectoral levels has occurred in the sample of 11 Asian economies. Labor productivity is \ncomputed by dividing real value added by the number of all employed persons. For the \npurpose of comparability, we use the real valued added at 2000 purchasing power \nparity (PPP) prices. Figure 3 shows the changes in average labor productivity levels for \nthe aggregate economy over the period 1990\u20132005. The figure shows a broad pattern \nof convergence in labor productivity levels for the aggregate economy. There is a \ntendency  of  convergence  at  the  sectoral  level  for  the  manufacturing  and  service \nsectors.4 But,  there  are  some  outlier  economies  which  have  not  shown  a  clear \nconvergence.  For  example,  India  and  Indonesia  have  not  shown  convergence  in \naggregate output per worker. Japan and Hong Kong, China are clear outliers in the \nagriculture sector. In the service sector, the Republic of Korea is an outlier. By contrast, \nIndia  has  rapidly  caught  up  in  service  labor  productivity,  while  it  has  not  been \nconverging in labor productivity in manufacturing.  \n                                                \n4 We test \u201cconvergence\u201d in labor productivity at the aggregate economy and sectoral levels using panel \ndata for 11 Asian economies. The estimation results from panel estimation with economy fixed effects \nsupport \u201cconvergence\u201d across the aggregate economy, and manufacturing and service sectors. No \nconvergence occurs in agricultural labor productivity of Asian economies. The results can be provided \nupon request. \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490                              Lee and McKibbin \n \nFigure 3: Sectoral Labor Productivity for 11 Asian Economies and the United \nStates \n \n \nSource: Authors\u2019 illustration based on Groningen Growth and Development Centre 10-Sector Database. \nDespite significant convergence of sectoral labor productivity over time, there remain \nsignificant  differences  in  sectoral  labor  productivity.  The  productivity  gap  between \nsectors within an economy is also very diverse. Table 1 shows the ratio of each \nsector\u2019s labor productivity to manufacturing labor productivity in 2005.

Here,  Indonesia  is  one  notable  exception  in  that  labor \nproductivity growth in the transport, storage, and communications branch was even \nlower than the average growth rate in the service sector. Note that this analysis does \nnot take into account the indirect effects of these services activities on productivity in \nother sectors. \nOther  service  activities  also  show  dynamic  productivity  growth  in  a  number  of \neconomies. For example, wholesale and retail trade, and the hotel and restaurant \nservice  branches  in  India  and  Singapore  experienced  very  high  labor  productivity \ngrowth.  In  Japan  and  Malaysia,  the  finance,  insurance,  real  estate,  and  business \nservices had high labor productivity growth. In contrast, in Indonesia, the Republic of \nKorea, and Thailand, the finance, insurance, real estate, and business services sectors \nshowed negative labor productivity growth rates. This reflects the impacts of the Asian \nfinancial crisis in 1997\u20131998.  \n2.5  Shift-Share Analysis \nIn this section we adopt the technique of \u201cshift-share\u201d analysis to examine empirically \nthe impact of tertiarization on aggregate productivity growth. Shift-share analysis shows \nhow  aggregate  labor  productivity  growth  is  linked  to  differential  growth  of  labor \nproductivity in individual sectors and the reallocation of labor between sectors. \n12 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490                              Lee and McKibbin \n \nIt uses an accounting technique to decompose aggregate labor productivity growth \nover  a  period  of  time  into  a  \u201cwithin  effect\u201d  (labor  productivity  growth  within  each \nindustry), and a \u201cshift effect\u201d or \u201cstructural change effect\u201d (labor productivity growth due \nto employment shifts toward more productive industries).  \nRecent papers such as Maudos et al. (2008), Maroto-S\u00e1nchez and Cuadrado-Roura \n(2009), Timmer and de Vries (2009), McMillian and Rodrik (2011), and de Vries et al. \n(2012) have used shift-share analysis to examine the impact of structural change on \neconomic growth.  \nWe  adopt  the  same  technique  to  analyze  the  role  of  tertiarization  for  aggregate \nproductivity growth in the Asian economies.  \n \nThe equation shows that the overall growth of labor productivity in an economy is \ndivided into two components. The first is the contribution from productivity growth within \nindividual sectors   weighted by the share of employment  in each sector \n(\u201cwithin effect\u201d). The second is the contribution from labor reallocation across different \nsectors (\u201cstructural change effect\u201d). The second term is the change of employment \nshares multiplied by productivity levels at the end of the time period across sectors.5 \nThe contribution of each sector in the structural change effect can be either positive or \nnegative,  depending  on  whether  a  sector  is  expanding  or  shrinking.  When  the \ncontributions  from  individual  sectors  are  aggregated,  the  structural  change  term \nbecomes negative, lowering economy-wide productivity growth, if the labor displaced \nfrom high-productivity growth sectors moves to low-productivity growth sectors.  \nTable 3 presents the results of the shift-share analysis using data from 1990 to 2005, \nconstructed from the data of nine sectors for the major Asian economies and the US.   \n                                                \n5 The structural change term is again divided into two components: the change of employment shares \nmultiplied by productivity levels at the beginning end of the time period (\u201cstatic structural change\u201d ) and \nthe interaction between the change in employment shares and the productivity growth in individual \nsectors (\u201cdynamic structural change\u201d). The results of shift-share analysis with static and dynamic \nstructural change terms are available from the corresponding author upon request. \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490                              Lee and McKibbin \n \nTable 3: Decomposition of Labor Productivity Growth, 1990\u20132005 \nEconomy  Sector  Total  Within  Structural Change \n         \nPeople\u2019s Republic  All economy  8.42  7.46  0.95 \nof China  Manufacturing  3.04  3.21  -0.17 \nServices  3.46  1.8  1.66 \n \nHong Kong, China  All economy  3.22  1.99  1.23 \nManufacturing  -0.2  0.7  -0.91 \nServices  3.43  1.14  2.28 \n \nIndonesia  All economy  2.74  1.7  1.04 \nManufacturing  1.1  0.76  0.33 \nServices  1.23  0.46  0.77 \n \nIndia  All economy  4.14  3.17  0.97 \nManufacturing  0.8  0.63  0.17 \nServices  2.68  2.05  0.62 \n \nJapan  All economy  1.4  1.41  -0.01 \nManufacturing  0.38  1.08  -0.71 \nServices  1.23  0.46  0.77 \n \nRepublic of Korea  All economy  3.82  5.19  -1.37 \nManufacturing  2.07  3.69  -1.62 \nServices  1.41  0.51  0.9 \n \nMalaysia  All economy  4  3.52  0.48 \nManufacturing  1.43  1.05  0.39 \nServices  2.31  1.6  0.72 \n \nPhilippines  All economy  0.94  0.81  0.14 \nManufacturing  0.15  0.24  -0.09 \nServices  0.79  0.23  0.56 \n \nSingapore  All economy  3.64  3.72  -0.08 \nManufacturing  1  1.8  -0.81 \nServices  2.53  1.75  0.78 \n \nThailand  All economy  3.01  1.36  1.64 \nManufacturing  1.74  0.72  1.01 \nServices  0.97  -0.11  1.07 \n \nTaipei,China  All economy  3.91  3.38  0.53 \nManufacturing  0.99  1.4  -0.42 \nServices  2.92  1.7  1.22 \n \nUnited States  All economy  1.78  2.07  -0.29 \nManufacturing  0.34  0.93  -0.59 \nServices  1.42  1.01  0.42 \nSource: Author\u2019s estimates. \nThe results show that the within effect dominates the effects of structural changes in \nmost of the Asian economies. Nevertheless, structural change has made a significant \ncontribution to the overall growth of labor productivity in several Asian economies \nincluding Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; and Thailand. McMillian and Rodrik (2011) \nargue that Asia is outstanding not so much in productivity growth within individual \nsectors, but in the broad pattern of structural change. But, clearly the strong labor \nproductivity growth in individual industries has been a salient feature of Asian economic \n14 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490                              Lee and McKibbin \n \ngrowth, while structural change has also contributed positively to labor productivity \ngrowth in many Asian economies.  \nTable 3 demonstrates the importance of the service sector in structural change and \naggregate productivity growth. In the industrialized Asian economies, including Hong \nKong, China; Japan; the Republic of Korea; Singapore; and Taipei,China; the structural \nchange effect of the manufacturing sector was negative because they experienced \nshifts of employment from manufacturing to the service sectors. Nevertheless, because \nthe service sector contributed positively to the overall structural change effect due to \nthe increase in service sector employment, the overall structural change effect became \neither small or positive.  \nFor the latecomers, including the PRC, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, both \nthe manufacturing and service sectors contributed positively to aggregate growth in \nterms of the structural change effect because these economies experienced increases \nin employment in both the manufacturing and service sectors during the period.   \nFor some economies, the service sector dominates the manufacturing sector in terms \nof contribution to aggregate labor productivity growth due to the strong positive within \nand  structural  change  effects  of  the  service  sector.  In  Hong  Kong,  China;  India; \nMalaysia; and Taipei,China; the service sector contributed more to the overall within \neffect aggregate growth than the manufacturing sector. In these economies, the strong \npositive  within  and  structural  change  effects  of  the  service  sector  contributed \nsignificantly to aggregate productivity growth. \n3.  SIMULATION OF THE EFFECTS OF SERVICE \nSECTOR PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH \nThis section investigates the effects of future changes in service sector productivity \ngrowth on structural change and economic growth in Asian economies. The empirical \nresults in the previous sections show that service sector productivity growth can be a \npotential engine of economic growth in Asian economies. However, faster productivity \ngrowth in the service sector can have significant spillovers to other sectors through \ninter-industry  input\u2013output  linkages,  factor  movements,  and  consumption  and \ninvestment dynamics. It can also have spillovers across the border through trade and \nfinancial linkages.  \nThe complete analysis requires an empirically based global intertemporal multi-sector \ngeneral equilibrium model (a large scale DSGE model). We adopt a model, called the \nG-Cubed model, to explore what happens if labor productivity rises in the service \nsector in individual Asian economies and then across all Asian economies at the same \ntime.  \n3.1  The Model \nThe model used in this paper is the G-Cubed model, which is an intertemporal general \nequilibrium  model  of  the  world  economy.  The  theoretical  structure  is  outlined  in \nMcKibbin and Wilcoxen (2013) and more details can be found in the Appendix. A \nnumber of studies, summarized in McKibbin and Vines (2000), show that the G-Cubed \nmodeling approach has been useful in assessing a range of issues across a number of \n15 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490                              Lee and McKibbin \n \neconomies since the mid-1980s.6 Some of the principal features of the model are as \nfollows. \nThe model is based on explicit intertemporal optimization by the agents (consumers \nand firms) in each economy. In contrast to static CGE models, time and dynamics are \nof fundamental importance in the G-Cubed model. The G-Cubed model is known as a \nDSGE  (dynamic  stochastic  general  equilibrium)  model  in  the  macroeconomics \nliterature and as an intertemporal general equilibrium (IGE) model in the computable \ngeneral equilibrium literature. The main difference from the small-scale DSGE models \nnow  popular  at  central  banks  is  the  large  amount  of  sectoral  disaggregation  and \nconsiderable degree of economy disaggregation. \nIn order to track the macro time series, the behavior of agents is modified to allow for \nshort-run deviations from optimal behavior either due to myopia or to restrictions on the \nability of households and firms to borrow at the risk-free bond rate on government debt. \nThus, aggregate consumption is a weighted average of consumption based on wealth \n(current asset valuation and expected future after-tax labor income) and consumption \nbased on current disposable income.7 Similarly, aggregate investment is a weighted \naverage of investment based on Tobin\u2019s Q (a market valuation of the expected future \nchange in the marginal product of capital relative to the cost) and investment based on \na backward looking version of Q. In the model software, it is possible to change the \ninformation set of forward-looking agents after a scenario begins to unfold. \nThe model allows for short-run nominal wage rigidity (by different degrees in different \neconomies) and, therefore, allows for significant periods of unemployment depending \non  the  labor  market  institutions  in  each  economy.  Equilibrium  between  aggregate \ndemand and aggregate output is maintained by flexible prices, which causes demand \nto adjust together with short-term supply. There is explicit treatment of the holding of \nfinancial  assets,  including  money.  Money  is  introduced  into  the  model  through  a \nrestriction that households require money to purchase goods. \nGlobal accounting identities are imposed on the model so, for example, for every \nborrower there is a lender, thereby avoiding the fallacy of composition. Likewise, the \nmodel gives a careful treatment of stock-flow relations, such as the accumulation of \ncurrent  account  deficits  into  foreign  claims  on  domestic  output,  which  has  to  be \nserviced by future trade surpluses. On the fiscal side, which is the focus of this study, \nthe accumulation of fiscal deficits into government debt has to be serviced from future \nrevenues\u2014though it does not have to be completely paid off. \nThe model distinguishes between the stickiness of physical capital within sectors and \nwithin economies, and the flexibility of financial capital, which immediately flows to \nwhere  expected  returns  are  highest.  This  important  distinction  leads  to  a  critical \ndifference between the quantity of physical capital that is available at any time to \nproduce goods and services, and the valuation of that capital as a result of decisions \nabout the allocation of financial capital. \nAs a result of this structure, the G-Cubed model contains rich dynamic behavior, driven \nby asset accumulation on the one hand, and by wage adjustment to a neoclassical \nsteady state on the other. It embodies a wide range of assumptions about individual \n                                                \n6 These issues include: German unification in the early 1990s; fiscal consolidation in Europe in the mid-\n1990s; the formation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); the Asian crisis; and the \nproductivity boom in the US. \n7 Once the level of overall consumption has been determined, spending is allocated among goods and \nservices  according  to  a two-tier constant  elasticity  of substitution  (CES) utility  function.  See  the \nAppendix for details of aggregate consumption as well as the demand equations for sectoral goods by \nthe households. \n16 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490                              Lee and McKibbin \n \nbehavior  and  empirical  regularities  in  a  general  equilibrium  framework.  The \ninterdependencies  are  solved  out  using  a  computer  algorithm  that  solves  for  the \nrational expectations equilibrium of the global economy.  \nTable 4: Economies and Regions in the G-Cubed Model \nUnited States   \nJapan  People\u2019s Republic of China \nUnited Kingdom  India \nGermany  Indonesia \nRest of eurozone  Rest of Asia \nCanada  Latin America \nAustralia  Other emerging economies \nRepublic of Korea  Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union \nRest of OECD  Middle East and oil-exporting economies \nOECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. \nSource: McKibbin and Wilcoxen (2013). \nIn the version of the model used here there are 17 economies and regions as set out in \nTable  4.  Asia,  Japan,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  the  PRC,  India,  and  Indonesia  are \nincluded as individual economies and the other economies are included as the rest of \nAsia.  Each  economy  has  six  sectors  (energy,  mining,  agriculture,  manufacturing \ndurables, manufacturing  non-durables,  and  services)  as  well  as  a  generic  capital-\nproducing sector in each economy that draws largely on the durable manufacturing \nsector for inputs (Table 5).  \nTable 5: Sectors of Production in Each Economy \nEnergy   Durable manufacturing \nMining  Non-durable manufacturing \nAgriculture  Services \nSource: McKibbin and Wilcoxen (2013). \nIn this model, each of the six sectors is represented by a price-taking firm, which \nchooses variable inputs and its level of investment in order to maximize its stock \nmarket value. Each firm\u2019s production technology is represented by a tier-structured \nconstant elasticity of substitution (CES) function. At the top tier, output is a function of \ncapital, labor, energy, and materials: \n\u03c3O\ni\n\uf8eb 1 \u03c3iO\u22121\uf8f6\u03c3iO\u22121\nQ = AO \uf8ec  \u2211 (\u03b4O)\u03c3iO X \u03c3iO \uf8f7\ni i \uf8ec ij ij \uf8f7\n\uf8ed j=K,L,E,M \uf8f8\n \n\u03b4O\nwhere Q is the output of industry I, X  is industry i\u2019s use of input j, and AO,  ij , and \u03c3O \ni ij i i\nare parameters. AO reflects the level of technology, \u03c3O is the elasticity of substitution, \ni i\n\u03b4O\nand  the  ij  parameters  reflect  the  weights  of  different  inputs  in  production;  the \nsuperscript o indicates that the parameters apply to the top, or \u201coutput\u201d, tier. Without \nloss of generality, we constrain the \u03b4\u2019s to sum to 1.  \nAt the second tier, inputs of energy and materials, XE and XM, are themselves CES \ni i\naggregates of goods and services. Energy is a single good 1 and materials are an \n17 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490                              Lee and McKibbin \n \naggregate of goods 2 through 6 (mining through services). The functional form used for \n\u03b4E\nthese tiers is identical except that the parameters of the energy tier are AE ,  ij , and \ni\n\u03b4M\n\u03c3E, and those of the materials tier are AM,  ij , and \u03c3M. \ni i i\nThe goods and services purchased by firms are, in turn, aggregates of imported and \ndomestic commodities which are taken to be imperfect substitutes. We assume that all \nagents in the economy have identical preferences over foreign and domestic varieties \nof  each  commodity.  We  represent  these  preferences  by  defining  12  composite \ncommodities that are produced from imported and domestic goods. Each of these \ncommodities, Y, is a CES function of inputs domestic output, Q, and imported goods, \ni i\nM.  For  example,  the  mining  products  purchased  by  agents  in  the  model  are  a \ni\ncomposite of imported and domestic mining. By constraining all agents in the model to \nhave the same preferences over the origin of goods, we require that, for example, the \nagricultural and service sectors have identical preferences over domestic energy and \nenergy imported from the Middle East.8 This accords with the input\u2013output data we use \nand  allows  a  very  convenient  nesting  of production,  investment,  and  consumption \ndecisions. \nIn each sector the capital stock changes according to the rate of fixed capital formation \n(J) and the rate of geometric depreciation (\u03b4): \ni i\nK\uf026  = J  \u2212 \u03b4 K\ni i i i \nWe  assume  that  the  investment  process  is  subject  to  rising  marginal  costs  of \ninstallation. To formalize this we adopt Uzawa\u2019s approach by assuming that in order to \ninstall J units of capital a firm must buy a larger quantity, I, that depends on its rate of \ninvestment (J/K): \n\uf8eb \u03c6 J \uf8f6\nIi = \uf8ec\uf8ec1+ i i \uf8f7\uf8f7 Ji\n\uf8ed 2 K \uf8f8\ni  \nwhere  \u03c6  is  a  non-negative  parameter.  The  difference  between  J  and  I  may  be \ninterpreted in various ways; we will view it as installation services provided by the \ncapital-goods vendor  \nThe goal of each firm is to choose its investment and inputs of labor, materials and \nenergy to maximize intertemporal risk-adjusted net-of-tax profits. Solving the top tier \noptimization problem gives the firm\u2019s factor demands for labor, energy, and materials, \nand the optimal evolution of the capital stock (see the Appendix).  \nG-Cubed\u2019s parameters are estimated from a consistent time series of input\u2013output \ntables for the United States. The procedure is described in detail in McKibbin and \nWilcoxen  (1999).  The  dataset  that  was  constructed  allowed  the  estimation  of  the \nmodel\u2019s parameters for the United States. The elasticity of substitution by sector and by \nlevel of nesting is estimated using the US data and this is applied to all economies. The \ndelta share parameters are calibrated using economy-specific input output data from \nGTAP.9 \n                                                \n8 This does not require that both sectors purchase the same amount of energy, or even that they purchase \nenergy at all; only that they both feel the same way about the origins of the energy they buy. \n9 See the GTAP database in Narayanan, G., Badri, Angel Aguiar, and Robert McDougall, eds. 2012. \n18 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490                              Lee and McKibbin \n \nTable 6 and Table 7 present the values of the elasticities of substitution \u03c3O, \u03c3E, \u03c3M, \ni i i\n\u03b4O \u03b4E \u03b4M\nand the  ij ,  ij , and  ij  parameters that appear on the production side of the \nmodel (as well as the substitution between domestic and foreign goods and between \neconomy of origin of foreign goods).

One is where all Asian economies \n(PRC, India, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, and the rest of Asia) experience a \nrise in labor productivity growth of 1 percentage point per year. The increase by 1 \npercentage point would be a challenge for economies such as India; Malaysia; and \nTaipei,China; which have already had relatively high service sector productivity growth \n(see Table 2). In contrast, for Japan and the Republic of Korea, which have low service \nsector productivity growth, there could be more potential to bring out such productivity \ngains  by  moving  toward  high-value  modern  services,  such  as  information  and \n10\ncommunications  technology,  finance,  and  professional  business  services.  We \nassume the productivity shock occurs in 2014 and then persists until 2053, after which \nthe shock in the growth rate of labor productivity growth rate decays by 4% per year \n                                                \n10 ADB (2012) point out that lack of human capital, inadequate infrastructure, and restrictive regulations \nare major bottlenecks for developing a modern service sector. \n21 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490                              Lee and McKibbin \n \nuntil returning to baseline in 2100.11 We then compare the cases where all Asian \neconomies successfully raise productivity growth in services to the case where each \neconomy in Asia experiences productivity growth of the same magnitude, but each \nindividually.  For  the  non-Asian  results  we  only  explore  the  spillovers  from  the \naggregate Asian growth experience.  \nHere, we consider the productivity shock only in the service sector. As a comparison, \nwe also present results at the sectoral level from the third simulation, which assumes \nthe  same  labor  productivity  shock  across  Asian  economies,  but  applied  to \nmanufacturing sectors (both durable and non-durable goods) rather than services. \nThe results are presented in Tables 8\u201311. Each table shows the deviation from the \nbaseline of a range of variables at different points into the future. In Table 8 and Table \n9, GDP, consumption, and investment are expressed as percentage deviations from \nthe  baseline.  Trade  balance  is  the  percent  of  baseline  GDP  deviation  from  the \nbaseline. Table 10 contains results for the percentage deviation in sectoral output by \neconomy over time. Table 11 shows the results for the sectoral percentage deviation \nfrom the baseline in employment by sector over time. These results are also presented \nin a series of graphs in Figures 6\u20139. \n                                                \n11 The reason for the particular time path is to ensure the long-run steady state of the model is preserved \nand to enable a long period of more rapid growth in service sector productivity until around 2050. \n22 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490

surprise rise in labor productivity of the service sector occurs, there is a \nreallocation of inputs within each economy. Higher productivity in one sector eventually \nraises GDP across the economy, although the presence of adjustment costs implies \nthat  initially  GDP  can  fall  as  inputs  are  reallocated.  Own  productivity  growth \noverwhelmingly  benefits  the  economy  experiencing  the  productivity  surge.  The \nmagnitude of GDP increase depends on the size of the service sector in the economy \nand its linkages to other sectors, especially manufacturing sectors. In an individual \neconomy, higher labor productivity raises the return to capital in the service sector. This \ninduces an increase in investment in that sector. It also causes an increase in demand \nand therefore output in all sectors that feed into that sector (see Table 10 and Figure \n9). In the model, investment goods are produced by a capital-producing sector that \ndraws largely on the output of the durable manufacturing sector so the demand for \ndurable manufacturing goods rises as part of the investment boom. This is true for the \ndomestically produced goods as well as for imports. In all economies that experience \nthe productivity increase, investment rises (Table 8). \nOver time all economies benefit from service sector productivity growth in another \neconomy through the increase in national wealth, which is spread globally. The extent \nof the gain depends on the linkages between economies outside of Asia and the \neconomies experiencing the productivity surge. For example, Australia gains far more \nthan the eurozone because of strong trade linkages, especially for intermediate inputs \nin Asia. Germany gains more than the rest of the eurozone because of the exports of \n25 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490                              Lee and McKibbin \n \ndurable goods for capital investment purposes from Germany to Asia (particularly the \nPRC).  \nThe increase in investment is initially funded by a rise in aggregate savings (or a fall in \nconsumption) as backward-looking agents do not fully incorporate higher wealth into \ntheir consumption decisions in the short term. The higher investment is also partly \nfunded by a capital inflow, with financial capital attracted to the higher return on capital \nin growing economies. This capital inflow appreciates the exchange rate in each Asian \neconomy and worsens the trade balance (which is the counterpart of the capital inflow). \nThe balance between financing domestically and through foreign capital varies across \nAsian economies depending on the scale of capital inflow required to build the new \ncapital stock. It ranges from large in Japan, to small in the Republic of Korea and the \nPRC (where capital controls lessen the available inflow).  \nFigure 6: GDP Effects of a Services Productivity Shock \n   \nGDP = gross domestic product, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, US = United States. \nSource: Authors\u2019 estimates. \n26 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490                              Lee and McKibbin \n \nFigure 7: Investment Effects of a Services Productivity Shock \n \nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, US = United States. \nSource: Authors\u2019 estimates. \n27 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490                              Lee and McKibbin \n \nFigure 8: Consumption Effects of a Services Productivity Shock \n \nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, US = United States. \nSource: Authors\u2019 estimates. \n28 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490                              Lee and McKibbin \n \nFigure 9: Sectoral Output and Employment Effects of a Services Productivity \nShock \n(%) \n(a) People\u2019s Republic of China \n \n(b) Japan \n \n(c) Republic of Korea \n \nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSource: Authors\u2019 estimates. \n29 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490                              Lee and McKibbin \n \nWe see that GDP rises in all Asian economies after the first year and in the long run \n(Table  8  and  Figure  6).  In  non-Asian  economies  such  as  the  United  States  and \nAustralia the results vary over time. The initial relocation of capital from the US lowers \nUS GDP below the baseline for 20 years, but eventually the higher demand from Asia \nthrough high wealth raises the demand for US goods. Australia is different because it is \nmore highly integrated into Asian production, particularly through the supply of mining \nand energy goods, which is very different to the US. Australia is more integrated into \nAsian production flows and the trade benefits of high growth in Asia dominate the \ncapital outflows from Australia. This illustrates that the spillovers between economies \noutside Asia and within Asia depend very much on trade patterns and the nature of the \ngoods traded. In particular, Australia experiences a surge in mining and energy exports \nthat feed into the faster growing Asian capital stocks. Thus, Australia\u2019s GDP rises \ncontinuously from the productivity surge in Asia whereas US GDP is below baseline for \nmore than 20 years because the capital relocation effect outweighs the positive trade \neffects. \nReturning to the sectoral level (Table 10, Table 11, and Figure 9), the results differ \nsubstantially  across  the  Asian  economies.  Because  the  shock  is  a  rise  in  labor \naugmenting  technical  change  in  the  service  sector,  fewer  workers  are  needed  to \nproduce the same level of output. Labor demand tends to fall in all service sectors \nexperiencing the productivity surge, thus freeing up labor to flow into other parts of the \neconomy. This  tends  to  raise the  marginal  product  of capital  in these  sectors. In \nparticular the demand for capital goods that are needed to build the capital stock for the \nexpanding service sector raises the demand for durable manufacturing goods well in \nexcess of other sectors. This result is found in each Asian economy, although to a \ndifferent extent depending on the capital intensity of the service sector relative to other \nsectors. The fact that the durable goods manufacturing sector is very different to the \nnon-durable goods manufacturing sector (which responds more like agriculture) is an \nimportant result and suggests that an aggregate manufacturing sector might mask an \nimportant  adjustment  process  especially  when  the capital  accumulation  process  is \nendogenous as it is in G-Cubed.  \nLooking more closely at individual economy results across the major sectors, we see \nthat in Table 10 for the PRC there is initially a rise in the output of the durable \nmanufacturing sector as new capital goods are built for the expanding services sectors. \nThe expansion of capital goods is front loaded compared to the persistent rise in labor \nproductivity in the service sector. The employment effects in durable manufacturing are \neven larger than for other sectors as workers move out of services into the expanding \ndurable manufacturing sector (Figure 9).  \nJapan (Table 10 and Figure 9) shows an even larger flow of workers out of the service \nsector into other sectors and particularly into the durable goods sector. This is because \ndurable goods is a sector with a large comparative advantage in Japan, with Japan \nbeing a major exporter of durable goods throughout Asia and globally. Japan is also \nmuch more labor intensive in services than the other Asia economies (see Table 7, \nparameter delta_k), hence input costs fall by more in Japanese services, and more \nlabor  flows  into  other  sectors  that  are  more  capital  intensive  than  in  other  Asian \neconomies. Thus the demand for durable goods for investment purposes increases \nsignificantly. The Republic of Korea also experiences a large rise in durables output for \nsimilar reasons to Japan, but other economies with less domestic capital production \nsuch as the PRC, India, and Indonesia have a much smaller expansion of durable \ngoods production than Japan or the Republic of Korea with some of the expansion \nspilling over into non-durable goods in the PRC.  \n30 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490                              Lee and McKibbin \n \nIn Table 10 and Table 11 we also present results for the Asia-wide rise in productivity \nin the two manufacturing sectors in the model\u2014durable and non-durable goods. Labor \nproductivity growth in durable goods reduces the costs of purchasing capital goods \nthroughout Asia because this sector largely produces the capital goods  that each \nsector purchases for investment. As the cost of capital goods falls, investment rises \nand  GDP  rises.  Capital-intensive  sectors  (especially  mining)  gain  most  from  this \nreduction in capital goods prices. In addition there is the relocation effect of labor from \nthe manufacturing sectors into the rest of the economy that parallels the adjustment for \nthe shock to service sector productivity. In the longer run, manufacturing productivity \ngrowth increases employment in the service industry but reduces employment growth \nin agriculture in all economies. \n4.  CONCLUDING REMARKS \nThis paper has empirically explored the historical experience of sectoral growth in \nmajor Asian economies with a focus on the performance of the service sector relative \nto the manufacturing sector and the implication for overall economic growth. It has \nfound evidence of significant catch-up in a number of sectors including the service \nsector, but there are a wide variety of experiences in each economy. It has also found \nthat a substantial gap still remains in labor productivity between the service sectors in \nAsia and the United States.  \nAlthough lower labor productivity in the service sector relative to the manufacturing \nsector has in general hampered overall economic growth in Asia, the evidence shows \nthat in several Asian economies, the service sector has made a significantly positive \ncontribution  to  aggregate  labor  productivity  growth,  both  through  own  productivity \ngrowth  and  structural  change  effects,  exceeding  the  net  contribution  of  the \nmanufacturing  sector.  In  addition,  some  \u201cmodern  services\u201d  industries  such  as  the \ntransportation,  storage,  communications,  financial  intermediation,  and  business \nservices have experienced higher productivity growth. \nOverall, empirical evidence from the historical data suggests enormous potential for \nservice sector productivity growth in Asia if policies can be adopted to enhance the \ncatch-up in services to be more like the experience with the manufacturing sector. One \ncritical question is whether enhancing productivity in the service sector can play the \nrole of a second growth engine to lead strong and sustainable growth in Asia in the \nfuture. We have addressed this question by exploring simulations of a multi-sectoral \ngeneral equilibrium model. We find that faster productivity growth in the service sector \nin  Asia  can  significantly  benefit  all  sectors,  contributing  to  more  balanced  and \nsustainable  growth  of  Asian  economies.  The  simulations  show  diverse  dynamic \nadjustment  across  economies.  We  find  that  in  contrast  to  the  simpler  models  of \neconomic growth, a key part of the structural adjustment story in the freeing up of labor \nfrom the service sector and a rise in the demand for durable manufacturing goods \nrequired building the physical capital stock that is induced by the productivity surge. \nThus both the service and durable goods sectors experience rapid growth in output, but \nemployment  shifts  mainly  toward  the  durable  goods  sector  during  the  adjustment \nprocess. This is particularly important in economies such as the Republic of Korea and \nJapan, which have high productivity in the durable manufacturing sector due to their \ncomparative advantage and openness to international trade in that sector. \nThe results of this paper suggest that the simple aggregate models and the models of \nlimited sectoral interactions may miss an important dynamic story of productivity growth \nin the service sector and capital accumulation in an integrated global economy.

This  appendix  draws  heavily  on  the  exposition  in  McKibbin  and \nWilcoxen (2013). \nThe version of the model used in this paper is the six-sector model with economy and \nsectoral coverage set out in Table 7 and Table 8.  \nEach  economy  or  region  in  the  model  consists  of  several  economic  agents: \nhouseholds, the government, the financial  sector,  and  six  production sectors. The \ntheoretical structure is outlined below. To keep the notation as simple as possible, \nvariables are not subscripted by economy except where needed for clarity. Throughout \nthe discussion all quantity variables will be normalized by the economy\u2019s endowment of \neffective labor units. Thus, the model\u2019s long run steady state will represent an economy \nin a balanced growth equilibrium. The solution software linearizes around the initial \nconditions in 2010 rather than the steady state. \nFirms \nEach of the six sectors is represented by a price-taking firm that chooses variable \ninputs and its level of investment in order to maximize its stock market value. Each \nfirm\u2019s production technology is represented by a tier-structured constant elasticity of \nsubstitution (CES) function. At the top tier, output is a function of capital, labor, energy, \nand materials: \n\u03c3O\ni\n\uf8eb 1 \u03c3iO\u22121\uf8f6\u03c3iO\u22121\nQ = AO \uf8ec  \u2211 (\u03b4O)\u03c3iO X \u03c3iO \uf8f7\ni i \uf8ec ij ij \uf8f7\n\uf8ed j=K,L,E,M \uf8f8\n            (1) \n\u03b4O\nwhere Q is the output of industry i, X  is industry i\u2019s use of input j, and AO,  ij , and \ni ij i\n\u03c3O  are  parameters.  AO  reflects  the  level  of  technology,  \u03c3O  is  the  elasticity  of \ni i i\n\u03b4O\nsubstitution,  and  the  ij  parameters  reflect  the  weights  of  different  inputs  in \nproduction; the superscript o indicates that the parameters apply to the top, or \u201coutput\u201d, \ntier. Without loss of generality, we constrain \u03b4 to sum to 1.  \nAt the second tier, inputs of energy and materials, X  and X , are themselves CES \niE iM\naggregates of goods and services. Energy is a single good 1 and materials is an \naggregate of goods 2\u20136 (mining through services). The functional form used for these \n\u03b4E\ntiers is identical to (1) except that the parameters of the energy tier are AE,  ij \u03c3E, and \ni i\n\u03b4M\n\u03c3iE, and those of the materials tier are AM,  ij , and \u03c3M. \ni i\nThe goods and services purchased by firms are, in turn, aggregates of imported and \ndomestic commodities, which are taken to be imperfect substitutes. We assume that all \nagents in the economy have identical preferences over foreign and domestic varieties \nof  each  commodity.  We  represent  these  preferences  by  defining  12  composite \ncommodities that are produced from imported and domestic goods. Each of these \ncommodities, Y, is a CES function of inputs domestic output, Q, and imported goods, \ni i\n36 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490                              Lee and McKibbin \n \nM.1 For  example,  the  mining  products  purchased  by  agents  in  the  model  are  a \ni\ncomposite of imported and domestic mining. By constraining all agents in the model to \nhave the same preferences over the origin of goods, we require that, for example, the \nagricultural and service sectors have identical preferences over domestic energy and \nenergy imported from the Middle East.2 This accords with the input\u2013output data we use \nand  allows  a  very  convenient  nesting  of production,  investment,  and  consumption \ndecisions. \nIn each sector, the capital stock changes according to the rate of fixed capital formation \n(J) and the rate of geometric depreciation (\u03b4): \ni i\nK\uf026  = J  \u2212 \u03b4 K\n        i i i i          (2) \nFollowing  the  cost  of  adjustment  models  of  Lucas  (1967),  Treadway  (1969),  and \nUzawa (1969) we assume that the investment process is subject to rising marginal \ncosts of installation. To formalize this we adopt Uzawa\u2019s approach by assuming that in \norder to install J units of capital a firm must buy a larger quantity, I, that depends on its \nrate of investment (J/K): \n\uf8eb \u03c6 J \uf8f6\nIi = \uf8ec\uf8ec1+ i i \uf8f7\uf8f7 Ji\n\uf8ed 2 K \uf8f8\n        i           (3) \nwhere  \u03c6  is  a  non-negative  parameter.  The  difference  between  J  and  I  may  be \ninterpreted various ways; we will view it as installation services provided by the capital-\ngoods vendor  \nThe goal of each firm is to choose its investment and inputs of labor, materials, and \nenergy  to  maximize  intertemporal  risk-adjusted  net-of-tax  profits.  For  analytical \ntractability, we assume that this problem is deterministic (equivalently, the firm could be \nassumed to believe its estimates of future variables with subjective certainty). Thus, the \nfirm will maximize:3 \n\u221e\n\u222b(\u03c0 \u2212 (1\u2212\u03c4 ) PII  ) e\u2212(R(s)+\u00b5ei\u2212 n)(s\u2212t)ds\ni 4 i\n      t        (4) \n\u00b5\nwhere  ei is a sector and region-specific equity risk premium variables are implicitly \nsubscripted by time. The firm\u2019s profits, \u03c0, are given by: \n\u03c0 = (1\u2212\u03c4)(P*Q \u2212W L \u2212PE X \u2212PM X )\n      i 2 i i i i i iE i iM     (5) \nwhere \u03c4  is the corporate income tax, \u03c4  is an investment tax credit, and P* is the \n2 4\nproducer price of the firm\u2019s output. R(s) is the long-term interest rate between periods t \nand s: \n1 s\nR(s) =   \u222br(v)dv\ns\u2212t\n        t          (6) \n                                                \n1 The elasticity of substitution in this function is the Armington elasticity. \n2 This does not require that both sectors purchase the same amount of energy, or even that they purchase \nenergy at all; only that they both feel the same way about the origins of energy they buy. \n3 The rate of growth of the economy\u2019s endowment of effective labor units, n, appears in the discount factor \nbecause the quantity and value variables in the model have been scaled by the number of effective \nlabor units.

Investment \ngoods are supplied, in turn, by a 13th industry that combines labor and the outputs of \nother industries to produce raw capital goods. We assume that this firm faces an \noptimization problem identical to those of the other 12 industries: it has a nested CES \nproduction function, uses inputs of capital, labor, energy, and materials in the top tier, \nincurs adjustment costs when changing its capital stock, and earns zero profits.

One side effect of this specification is that it \nprevents us from computing an equivalent variation. Since the behavior of some of the households is \ninconsistent, either because the households are at corner solutions or for some other reason, aggregate \nbehavior is inconsistent with the expenditure function derived from our utility function. \n7 The use of the CES function has the undesirable effect of imposing unitary income elasticities, a \nrestriction usually rejected by data. An alternative would be to replace this specification with one derived \nfrom the linear expenditure system. \n40 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490                              Lee and McKibbin \n \nHousehold capital services consist of the service flows of consumer durables plus \nresidential  housing.  The  supply  of  household  capital  services  is  determined  by \nconsumers themselves who invest in household capital, KC, in order to generate a \ndesired flow of capital services, CK, according to the following production function: \nCK = \u03b1KC\n                    (23) \nwhere \u03b1 is a constant. Accumulation of household capital is subject to the condition: \nK\uf026C = JC \u2212 \u03b4CKC\n                  (24) \nWe assume that changing the household capital stock is subject to adjustment costs, \nso household spending on investment, IC, is related to JC by: \n\uf8eb \u03c6C JC \uf8f6\nIC = \uf8ec\uf8ec1 +  \uf8f7\uf8f7JC\n\uf8ed 2 KC\uf8f8\n                 (25) \nThus the household\u2019s investment decision is to choose IC to maximize: \n\u221e\n\u222b(PCK\u03b1Kc\u2212PIIC)e\u2212(R(s)+\u00b5z\u2212n)(s\u2212t)ds\n        t       (26) \n\u00b5\nwhere PCK is the imputed rental price of household capital and  z is a risk premium on \nhousehold capital (possibly zero). This problem is nearly identical to the investment \nproblem  faced  by  firms,  including  the  partial  adjustment  mechanism  outlined  in \nequations (13) and (14), and the results are very similar. The only important difference \nis that no variable factors are used in producing household capital services. \nThe Labor Market \nWe assume that labor is perfectly mobile among sectors within each region but is \nimmobile  between  regions. Thus,  wages  will  be  equal  across  sectors  within  each \nregion, but will generally not be equal between regions. In the long run, labor supply is \ncompletely inelastic and is determined by the exogenous rate of population growth. \nLong run wages adjust to move each region to full employment. In the short run, \nhowever, nominal wages are assumed to adjust slowly according to an overlapping \ncontracts model where wages are set based on current and expected inflation and on \nlabor demand relative to labor supply. This can lead to short-run unemployment if \nunexpected shocks cause the real wage to be too high to clear the labor market. At the \nsame time, employment can temporarily exceed its long-run level if unexpected events \ncause the real wage to be below its long-run equilibrium. \nGovernment \nWe  take  each  region\u2019s  real  government  spending  on  goods  and  services  to  be \nexogenous and assume that it is allocated among inputs in fixed proportions, which we \nset to 2006 values. Total government outlays include purchases of goods and services \nplus interest payments on government debt, investment tax credits, and transfers to \nhouseholds. Government revenue comes from sales taxes, corporate and personal \nincome taxes, and from sales of new government bonds. In addition, there can be \ntaxes  on  externalities  such  as  carbon  dioxide  emissions. \n41 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490                              Lee and McKibbin \n \nThe government budget constraint may be written in terms of the accumulation of \npublic debt as follows: \nB\uf026  = D = r B + G + TR \u2212 T\n        t t t t t t t      (27) \nwhere B is the stock of debt, D is the budget deficit, G is total government spending on \ngoods and services, TR is transfer payments to households, and T is total tax revenue \nnet of any investment tax credit. \nWe assume that agents will not hold government bonds unless they expect the bonds \nto be paid off eventually and accordingly impose the following transversality condition:  \nlimB(s)e\u2212(R(s)\u2212n)s = 0\n        s\u2192 \u221e          (28) \nThis prevents per capita government debt from growing faster than the interest rate \nforever.  If  the  government  is  fully  leveraged  at  all  times,  (28)  allows  (27)  to  be \nintegrated to give: \n\u221e\nB = \u222b(T \u2212G\u2212TR)e\u2212(R(s)\u2212n)(s\u2212t)ds\nt\n        t       (29) \nThus, the current level of debt will always be exactly equal to the present value of \nfuture budget surpluses.8 \nThe implication of (29) is that a government running a budget deficit today must run an \nappropriate budget surplus at some point in the future. Otherwise, the government \nwould be unable to pay interest on the debt and agents would not be willing to hold it. \nTo ensure that (29) holds at all points in time we assume that the government levies a \nlump sum tax in each period equal to the value of interest payments on the outstanding \ndebt.9 In effect, therefore, any increase in government debt is financed by consols, and \nfuture taxes are raised enough to accommodate the increased interest costs. Other \nfiscal closure rules are possible, such as requiring the ratio of government debt to GDP \nto be unchanged in the long run or that the fiscal deficit be exogenous with a lump sum \ntax ensuring this holds. These closures have interesting implications but are beyond \nthe scope of this paper. \nFinancial Markets and the Balance of Payments \nThe 17 regions in the model are linked by flows of goods and assets. Flows of goods \nare determined by the import demands described above. These demands can be \nsummarized in a set of bilateral trade matrices which give the flows of each good \nbetween exporting and importing economies. There is one 9x9 trade matrix for each of \nthe 12 goods. \nTrade imbalances are financed by flows of assets between economies. Each region \nwith a current account deficit will have a matching capital account surplus, and vice \n                                                \n8 Strictly speaking, public debt must be less than or equal to the present value of future budget surpluses.  \nFor tractability we assume that the government is initially fully leveraged so that this constraint holds \nwith equality. \n9 In the model the tax is actually levied on the difference between interest payments on the debt and what \ninterest payments would have been if the debt had remained at its base case level. The remainder, \ninterest payments on the base case debt, is financed by ordinary taxes. \n42 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490                              Lee and McKibbin \n \nversa.10 We assume asset markets are perfectly integrated across regions. With free \nmobility of capital, expected returns on loans denominated in the currencies of the \nvarious regions must be equalized period to period according to  a set of interest \narbitrage relations of the following form: \nE\uf026 j\ni +\u00b5 = i +\u00b5 +  k\nk k j j Ej\n        k         (30) \nwhere i  and i are the interest rates in economies k and j, \u00b5  and \u00b5 are exogenous risk \nk j k j\npremiums demanded by investors (possibly 0), and E j is the exchange rate between \nk\nthe currencies of the two economies.11 However, in cases where there are institutional \nrigidities to capital flows, the arbitrage condition does not hold and we replace it with an \nexplicit model of the relevant restrictions (such as capital controls). \nCapital flows may take the form of portfolio investment or direct investment but we \nassume these are perfectly substitutable ex ante, adjusting to the expected rates of \nreturn across economies and across sectors. Within each economy, the expected \nreturns to each type of asset are equated by arbitrage, taking into account the costs of \nadjusting physical capital stock and allowing for exogenous risk premiums. However, \nbecause  physical  capital  is  costly  to  adjust,  any  inflow  of  financial  capital  that  is \ninvested in physical capital will also be costly to shift once it is in place. This means \nthat unexpected events can cause windfall gains and losses to owners of physical \ncapital and ex post returns can vary substantially across economies and sectors. For \nexample, if a shock lowers profits in a particular industry, the physical capital stock in \nthe sector will initially be unchanged but its financial value will drop immediately. \nMoney and Monetary Rules \nWe assume that money enters the model via a constraint on transactions.12 We use a \nmoney demand function in which the demand for real money balances is a function of \nthe value of aggregate output and short-term nominal interest rates: \nMON = PYi\u03b5\n                   (31) \nwhere Y is aggregate output, P is a price index for Y, i is the interest rate, and \u03b5 is the \ninterest elasticity of money demand. Following McKibbin and Sachs (1991) we take \u03b5 to \nbe -0.6.  \nOn the supply side, the model includes an endogenous monetary response function for \neach  region.  Each  region\u2019s  central  bank  is  assumed  to  adjust  short-term  nominal \ninterest rates following a modified Henderson-McKibbin-Taylor rule made up of two \nequations. The first is a desired interest rate (id) and the second is the actual policy \ninterest rate (it) which adjusts to the desired rate over time.  \n                                                \n10 Global net flows of private capital are constrained to be 0 at all times\u2014the total of all funds borrowed \nexactly equals the total funds lent.  As a theoretical matter this may seem obvious, but it is often violated \nin international financial data. \n11 The one exception to this is the oil exporting region, which we treat as choosing its foreign lending in \norder to maintain a desired ratio of income to wealth. \n12 Unlike other components of the model we simply assume this rather than deriving it from optimizing \nbehavior. Money demand can be derived from optimization under various assumptions: money gives \ndirect utility; it is a factor of production; or it must be used to conduct transactions. The distinctions are \nnot important for our purposes. \n43 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490                              Lee and McKibbin \n \nThe two equations follow:  \n  (27a)    \n        (27b) \nThe desired interest rate (id) evolves as a function of actual inflation (\u03c0) relative to \n\u03c0T \u2206yT\ntarget inflation ( ), output growth (\u0394y) relative to growth of potential output ( ), \nnominal income (ny) relative to target nominal income (nyT )and the change in the \n\u2206eT\nexchange rate (\u0394e) relative to the bank\u2019s target change ( ). The actual policy interest \nrate (i) adjusts gradually to the desired policy rate (id) and can be shifted exogenously \nt\nin the short term by changing the exogenous component (ix). \nThe  parameters  in  the  monetary  response  function  vary  across  economies.  For \nexample, economies that peg their exchange rate to the US dollar have a very large \nvalue for \u03b2 . In the current model we assume that nominal income targeting is the \n4\nmajor policy rule given the results are forward looking and most economies will move \nover time to this type of rule. The rule also needs to be able to model unconventional \nmonetary policies in some advanced economies through adjustment to the exogenous \npart of the rule (ix). \nParameterization \nTo estimate G-Cubed\u2019s parameters we began by constructing a consistent time series \nof input\u2013output tables for the US. The procedure is described in detail in McKibbin and \nWilcoxen (1999) and can be summarized as follows. We started with the detailed \nbenchmark US input\u2013output transactions tables produced by the Bureau of Economic \nAnalysis (BEA) and converted them to a standard set of industrial classifications, then \naggregated them to 12 sectors.13 Second, we corrected the treatment of consumer \ndurables, which are included in consumption rather than investment in the US National \nIncome  and  Product  Accounts  and  the  benchmark  input\u2013output  tables.  Third,  we \nsupplemented the value added rows of the tables using a detailed dataset on capital \nand  labor  input  by  industry  constructed  by  Dale  Jorgenson  and  his  colleagues.14 \nFinally, we obtained prices for each good in each benchmark year from the output and \nemployment  dataset  constructed  by  the  Office  of  Employment  Projections  at  the \nBureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).  \nThis dataset allowed us to estimate the model\u2019s parameters for the US. To estimate the \nproduction side of the model, we began with the energy and materials tiers because \nthey  have  constant  returns to  scale  and  all  inputs  are  variable. In this  case  it  is \n                                                \n13 Converting the data to a standard basis was necessary because the sector definitions and accounting \nconventions used by the BEA have changed over time. \n14 Primary factors often account for half or more of industry costs so it is particularly important that this part \nof the dataset be constructed as carefully as possible. From the standpoint of estimating cost and \nproduction functions, however, value added is the least satisfactory part of the benchmark input\u2013output \ntables. In the early tables, labor and capital are not disaggregated. In all years, the techniques used by \nthe BEA to construct implicit price deflators for labor and capital are subject to various methodological \nproblems. One example is that the income of proprietors is not split between capital and imputed labor \nincome correctly. The Jorgenson dataset corrects these problems and is the work of several people \nover many years. In addition to Dale Jorgenson, some of the contributors were L. Christensen, Barbara \nFraumeni, Mun Sing Ho, and Dae Keun Park. The original source of the data is the Fourteen \nComponents of Income tape produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Rather than using (36), a common approach is \nto use factor demands of the form: \n\u03c3O\ni\nQ \uf8eb \uf8f61\u2212\u03c3O\n    Xij = \u03b4ij Pi\u2212\u03c3iO AiOi \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8edk=K\u2211,L,E\u03b4,MikPk1\u2212\u03c3iO \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 i         (37) \nThis expression is correct only if all inputs are variable in the short run. In McKibbin and \nWilcoxen (1999) we show that using equation (37) biases the estimated elasticity of \nsubstitution  toward  unity  for  many  sectors  in  the  model  In  petroleum  refining,  for \nexample, the fixed-capital estimate for the top tier elasticity, \u03c3O, is 0.54 while in the \ni\nvariable elasticity case it is 1.04. The treatment of capital thus has a very significant \neffect on the estimated elasticities of substitution. \nEstimating parameters for regions other than the US is more difficult because time-\nseries input\u2013output data is often unavailable. In part this is because some economies \ndo not collect the data regularly and in part because many of G-Cubed\u2019s geographic \nentities  are regions rather than  individual  economies.  As  a  result,  we  impose  the \nrestriction  that  substitution  elasticities  within  individual  industries  are  equal  across \nregions.17 By doing so, we are able to use the US elasticity estimates everywhere. The \nshare parameters (\u03b4 in the equations above), however, are derived from regional input\u2013\noutput data taken from the GTAP 8 database and differ from one region to another. In \neffect, we are assuming that all regions share similar but not identical production \ntechnology. This is intermediate between one extreme of assuming that the regions \nshare common technologies and the other extreme of allowing the technologies to \ndiffer in arbitrary ways. The regions also differ in their endowments of primary factors, \ntheir government policies, and patterns of final demands. \nFinal demand parameters, such as those in the utility function or in the production \nfunction of new investment goods were estimated by a similar procedure: elasticities \nwere  estimated from  US  data  and share  parameters  were  obtained from  regional \ninput\u2013output tables. Trade shares were obtained from 2009 United Nations Standard \nIndustry Trade Classification (SITC) data aggregated up from the four-digit level.18 The \ntrade elasticities are based on a survey of the literature and vary between 1 and 3.19. \nTable A1 contains some key parameters for the Asian economies in the model. \n                                                \n17 For example, the top tier elasticity of substitution is identical in the durable goods industries of Japan \nand the US. This approach is consistent with the econometric evidence of Kim and Lau (1995). This \nspecification does not mean, however, that the elasticities are the same across industries within an \neconomy. \n18 A full mapping of SITC codes into G-Cubed industries is available on request. \n \n46 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 490                              Lee and McKibbin \n \nTable A1: Key Macro Parameters \nadapt  0.35 \nint_elast  -0.6 \nlabgrow  0.018 \nphi_1  4 \nphi_2  15 \nphi_3  4 \nphi_4  4 \nphi_5  4 \nphi_6  4 \nphi_y  4 \nphi_z  4 \ntimepref  0.022 \nwage_p  0.4 \nwage_q  0.35 \ndelta  0.1 \nfore_i  0.3 \nfore_c  0.3 \nmpc  1 \nr0  0.04 \nSource: G-Cubed model database version 110V. \n \n47 \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "Jong-Wha Lee and Warwick J.
