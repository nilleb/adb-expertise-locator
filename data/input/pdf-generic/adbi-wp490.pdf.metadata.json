The model allows for input\u2013\noutput linkages and capital movements across industries and economies, and consumption \nand investment dynamics. We find that faster productivity growth in the service sector in Asia \nbenefits  all  sectors  eventually,  and  contributes  to  the  sustained  and  balanced  growth  of \nAsian  economies,  but  the  dynamic  adjustment  is  different  across  economies.  This \nadjustment  depends  on  the  sectoral  composition  of  each  economy,  the  capital  intensity  of \neach sector, and the openness of each sector to international trade. In particular, during the \nadjustment  to  higher  services  productivity  growth,  there  is  a  significant  expansion  of  the \ndurable manufacturing sector that is required to provide the capital stock that accompanies \nthe higher aggregate economic growth rate. \n \nJEL Classification: J21, O11, O14, O41, O53 \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\nContents \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n                   Lee and McKibbin \n\nIntroduction ................................................................................................................ 3 \n\nStructural Transformation and Economic Growth in Asia ........................................... 4 \n\n2.1 \n2.2 \n2.3 \n2.4 \n2.5 \n\nData and Sample ........................................................................................... 5 \nPattern of Structural Change .......................................................................... 5 \nConvergence of Sectoral Labor Productivity .................................................. 8 \nPatterns of Structural Change and Economic Growth .................................. 11 \nShift-Share Analysis ..................................................................................... 12 \n\n3. \n\nSimulation of the Effects of Service Sector Productivity Growth ............................... 15 \n\n3.1 \n3.2 \n\nThe Model .................................................................................................... 15 \nSimulation Results ....................................................................................... 21 \n\n4. \n\nConcluding Remarks ............................................................................................... 31 \n\nReferences ......................................................................................................................... 33 \n\nAppendix: The G-Cubed Model ........................................................................................... 36 \n\n \n1. \n\n2. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\n1.  INTRODUCTION \n\nThe  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  analyze  the  role  of  the  service  sector  in  structural \nadjustment  and  economic  growth  in  Asia.  The  paper  empirically  investigates  the \nhistorical experience of Asian economies and explores a scenario of more rapid catch-\nup of service sector productivity growth over the coming decades for Asian economies.  \n\nIn  the  era  of  industrialization  since  World  War  II,  major  Asian  economies,  including \nJapan,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  and  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  have \nundergone  spectacular  economic  transformations\u2015fast  economic  growth  and  major \nemployment  shifts  from  the  agriculture  sector  to  the  manufacturing  sector.  The \nmanufacturing  sector  has  been  a  key  engine  of  growth  over  this  period.  This  rapid \nindustrialization has been supported by high savings and investment rates and export-\noriented  policies.  In  recent  decades,  however,  the  pace  of  output  growth  in  the \nindustrialized  East  Asian  economies  has  slowed  significantly.  Japan  and  newly \nindustrialized  economies  (NIEs)  in  Asia  that  had  experienced  fast  growth  began  to \ngrow less rapidly over time as the gap between their per capita incomes and that of the \nUS  narrowed.  A  number  of  factors,  including  slower  labor  force  growth,  lower \ninvestment  rates,  declining  rates  of  return  to  investment,  and  sluggish  technology \nadvancement have been highlighted as major causes of the \u201cgrowth deceleration.\u201d \n\nAnother salient feature in East Asia\u2019s growth is the rise of service industries with major \nemployment  shifts  toward  the  service  sector.  The  well-established  empirical  stylized \nfact  shows  that  there  is  a  positive  relationship  between  the  share  of  services  in  GDP \n(or total employment) and GDP per capita (Clark 1957; Chenery 1960). More recently, \nEichengreen  and  Gupta  (2012)  argue  that  the  relationship  is  not  linear,  following  two \ndistinct \u201cwave\u201d patterns of service sector growth. In the first wave, the service share in \noutput  and  employment rises  with  GDP  per  capita  at  a decelerating  rate. The  service \nshare rises again in the second wave at a higher income level. They argue that the first \nwave  features  the  rise  of  traditional  services  while  incomes  are  still  low,  while  the \nsecond  wave  features  modern  services  including  post  and  communications,  financial \nintermediation, computer, and business services.  \n\nHow  does  the  rise  in  the  service  sector  contribute  to  overall  growth  in  Asian \neconomies?  As  an  economy  grows,  the  service  sector  becomes  larger  and  hence \noverall  growth  depends  more  on  the  performance  of  the  service  sector.  Thus,  the \nservice  sector\u2019s  contribution  to  overall  growth  tends  to  become  proportionally  larger \nwith  economic  development  and  expansion  of  the  service  sector.  However,  if  labor \nproductivity growth of the service sector is lower than that of the industrial sector, the \nincrease  in  the  size  of  the  service  sector  with  deindustrialization  can  have  a  harmful \neffect on overall output growth. \n\nThe literature presents a number of theories that attempt to explain the change in the \nservice sector share and its implication to overall economic growth. Structural change \ncan be driven by both demand and supply-side factors. The seminal paper by Baumol \n(1967) presents a model of \u201cunbalanced growth,\u201d in which higher productivity growth in \nthe \u201cprogressive\u201d (manufacturing) sector than in the \u201cstagnant\u201d (service) sector causes \nshifts  of  labor  from  manufacturing  to  service  industries  and  shows  that  aggregate \noutput  growth  slows  down  over  time  as  the  sector  with  the  lower  productivity  growth \nexpands. \n\nRecent  papers  by  Ngai  and  Pissarides  (2007)  and  Acemoglu  and  Guerrieri  (2008) \ndevelop multisector growth models motivated by Baumol. These models imply that total \nfactor  productivity  or  factor  proportion  differences  generate  employment  shifts  to  the \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\n\u201cstagnant\u201d  (service)  sector  over  the  (non)-balanced  growth  path.  Another  strand  of \nliterature including Laitner (2000); Kogsamut, Rebelo, and Xie (2001); and Foellmi and \nZweimuller (2008) rely on a demand side explanation for structural change.1  \n\nThis  paper  uses  an  empirically  based  global  intertemporal  multisector  general \nequilibrium  model  (a  large  scale  DSGE  model)  to  explore  what  happens  if  labor \nproductivity  rises  in  the  service  sector  in  individual  Asian  economies  and  then  across \nall  Asian  economies  at  the  same  time.  The  model  allows  for  consideration  of  inter-\nindustry  input\u2013output  linkages,  factor  movements,  and  consumption  and  investment \ndynamics. The model also incorporates spillovers across the border through trade and \nfinancial  linkages.  The  results  show  that  enhancing  productivity  in  the  service  sector \ncan play a major role as a new growth engine leading to Asia\u2019s strong and sustainable \ngrowth in the long run. Labor moves out of the service sector in the longer run but the \nadjustment across the other non-service sectors in the short run depends on a range of \nfactors. These include the characteristics of each sector (in terms of factor inputs and \ndemand bundles), and what happens to aggregate investment and consumption in an \neconomy and the sectoral composition of that spending and the effects of productivity \ngrowth  on  the  real  exchange  rate  through  inflows  of  global  capital,  which  temporally \nhurt  the  competitiveness  of  trade-exposed  sectors.  The  story  is  quite  complex  in  the \ndecades  following  a  new  productivity  surge,  but  in  the  longer  term  the  outcome  is \nbroadly  similar to the  Ngai  and  Pissarides (2007)  and  Acemoglu  and Guerrieri (2008) \nadjustment story.  \n\nA  number  of  recent  papers  focus  on  analyzing  the  patterns  of  structural  change  and \neconomic growth experiences of the major East Asian economies such as Japan and \nthe  emerging  Asian  economies  (ADB  2012;  Buera  and  Kaboski  2012;  Uy,  Yi,  and \nZhang  2013).  However,  as  far  as  we  are  aware,  no  paper  has  explicitly  focused  on \ninvestigating  the  short-run  adjustment  and  the  long-run  implications  of  expanding \nservice sector productivity growth on overall economic growth in Asia.  \n\nThis paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data and analyzes the stylized \npatterns  in  structural  change  and  convergence  of  labor  productivity  in  the  Asian \neconomies. We also adopt the technique of shift-share analysis to investigate the role \nof  service  sector  productivity  growth  in  overall  economic  growth.  Section  3  uses  the \nempirical results on historical productivity experience in Asia as exogenous inputs into \na large-scale intertemporal general equilibrium model of the global economy. Given this \nfuture baseline, we then explore different future scenarios of service sector productivity \ngrowth  in  Asia,  and  examine  how  these  affect  Asian  economies  individually  and  the \nspillovers  within  Asia  and  throughout  the  world.  Section  4  provides  some  concluding \nobservations. \n\n2.  STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION AND ECONOMIC \n\nGROWTH IN ASIA \n\nIn  this  section,  we  document  the  patterns  of  structural  transformation,  focusing  on \nchanges  in  the  share  of  services  in  total  output  and  employment  in  major  Asian \neconomies.  \n\n                                                \n1 See Herrendorf, Rogerson, and Valentinyi (2013) for a literature survey. \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\n2.1  Data and Sample \n\nOur  data  are  from  the  Groningen  Growth  Developing  Centre  (GGDC)  10-sector \ndatabase,  which  provides  annual  data  on  value  added  (at  both  current  and  constant \nprices)  and  employment  data  from  1970  to  2005  (Timmer  and  de  Vries  2007).  The \nGGDC  data  provides  disaggregated  data  consisting  of  10  sectors,  as  defined  by  the \nISIC  Revision  2.  The  data  covers  10  Asian  economies:  Japan,  four  Asian  NIEs \n(Republic  of  Korea;  Taipei,China;  Singapore;  and  Hong  Kong,  China),  ASEAN-4 \n(Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand), and India.  \n\nWe have expanded the sample by adding the PRC, using data compiled by McMillian \nand  Rodrik  (2011).  We  have  also  added  the  United  States  (US)  as  the  reference \ncountry, for which data is available from the GGDC 10-sector database.  \n\nWe aggregate the original data into nine sectors by combining community, social, and \npersonal services with government services. The service sector consists of four service \nbranches:  wholesale  and  retail  trade;  hotels  and  restaurants;  transport,  storage,  and \ncommunications; \ninsurance,  real  estate,  and  business  services;  and \ncommunity, social, personal, and government services. \n\nfinance, \n\nWe focus on the sample period from 1990 to 2005 because data on PRC industries are \navailable from 1990. \n\n2.2  Pattern of Structural Change \n\nFigure  1  summarizes  changes  in  sectoral  employment  shares  for  the  agriculture, \nmanufacturing,  and  service  sectors.  The  vertical  axis  is  the  share  of  employment  in \n1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005 in 11 major Asian economies and the US. The horizontal \naxis  is  the  log  of  GDP  per  worker  in  2000  international  dollars.  Figure  2  summarizes \nthe change in sectoral value added in current prices.2  \n\nThe  figures  confirm  the  stylized  patterns  of  structural  change  in  the  previous  studies \n(and the survey by Herrendorf, Rogerson, and Valentinyi [2013]). Increase in GDP per \ncapita  is  associated  with  decreases  in  employment  and  value  added  shares  for \nagriculture,  and  increases  in  employment  and  value  added  shares  for  services.  The \nmanufacturing employment and value added shares show hump-shaped changes.3 \n\nIt is clear that there have been major employment shifts toward the service sector in 11 \nmajor Asian economies over the period 1990\u20132005. In Japan, the share of employment \nin the service sector increased from 57.4% in 1990 to 67.1% in 2000, while it increased \nmore dramatically in the Republic of Korea from 46.2% to 64.4% over the same period. \nThe  employment  share  of  the  service  sector  in  the  PRC  also  increased  steadily  over \nthe period from 19.9% to 32.6%. \n\n \n\n                                                \n2 The patterns are similar for the value added shares with real values. \n3 Uy, Yi, and Zhang (2013) present an open economy model in which the declining portion of the hump is \n\nnot well explained.  \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\nFigure 1: Sector Shares of Employment for 11 Asian Economies and the United \nStates, 1990\u20132005 \n(%) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGDP = gross domestic product. \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 illustration based on Groningen Growth and Development Centre 10-Sector Database. \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\nFigure 2: Sector Shares of Value Added for 11 Asian Economies and the United \nStates, 1990\u20132005 \n(%) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGDP = gross domestic product. \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 illustration based on Groningen Growth and Development Centre 10-Sector Database. \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\nThe figures for the employment share and value added share of services suggest that \nthere  is  an  acceleration  in  the  rate  of  increase  of  around  9.5  in  the  log  of  GDP  per \nworker,  consistent  with  the  evidence  in  Buera  and  Kaboski  (2012)  and  Eichengreen \nand Gupta (2012).  \n\n2.3  Convergence of Sectoral Labor Productivity \n\nWe  assess  whether  convergence  in  labor  productivity  at  the  aggregate  economy  and \nsectoral levels has occurred in the sample of 11 Asian economies. Labor productivity is \ncomputed by dividing real value added by the number of all employed persons. For the \npurpose  of  comparability,  we  use  the  real  valued  added  at  2000  purchasing  power \nparity (PPP) prices. Figure 3 shows the changes in average labor productivity levels for \nthe aggregate economy over the period 1990\u20132005. The figure shows a broad pattern \nof  convergence  in  labor  productivity  levels  for  the  aggregate  economy.  There  is  a \ntendency  of  convergence  at  the  sectoral  level  for  the  manufacturing  and  service \nsectors. 4  But,  there  are  some  outlier  economies  which  have  not  shown  a  clear \nconvergence.  For  example,  India  and  Indonesia  have  not  shown  convergence  in \naggregate  output  per  worker.  Japan  and  Hong  Kong,  China  are  clear  outliers  in  the \nagriculture sector. In the service sector, the Republic of Korea is an outlier. By contrast, \nIndia  has  rapidly  caught  up  in  service  labor  productivity,  while  it  has  not  been \nconverging in labor productivity in manufacturing.  \n\n                                                \n4 We  test  \u201cconvergence\u201d  in  labor  productivity  at  the  aggregate  economy  and  sectoral  levels  using  panel \ndata for 11 Asian economies. The estimation results from panel estimation with economy fixed effects \nsupport  \u201cconvergence\u201d  across  the  aggregate  economy,  and  manufacturing  and  service  sectors.  No \nconvergence occurs in agricultural labor productivity of Asian economies. The results can be provided \nupon request. \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\nFigure 3: Sectoral Labor Productivity for 11 Asian Economies and the United \nStates \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 illustration based on Groningen Growth and Development Centre 10-Sector Database. \n\nDespite  significant  convergence  of  sectoral  labor  productivity  over  time,  there  remain \nsignificant  differences  in  sectoral  labor  productivity.  The  productivity  gap  between \nsectors  within  an  economy  is  also  very  diverse.

In  Hong  Kong, \nChina;  India;  and  Taipei,China  labor  productivity  in  the  service  sectors  is  higher  than \nthat for manufacturing, while it is far lower than manufacturing labor productivity in the \nRepublic of Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand (Figure 4).  \n\n9 \n \n\n\f \n\nAgriculture, \nhunting, forestry, \nand fishing \n\nWholesale and retail \ntrade, and \nrestaurants \nTransport, storage, \nand communications \nFinance, real estate, \nand business \nservices \nCommunity and \ngovernment services \n\nADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\nTable 1: Ratio of Sector Labor Productivity to Manufacturing Labor Productivity \nin 2005 \n\nPRC  HKG \n\nINO \n\nIND \n\nJPN \n\nKOR  MAL  PHI \n\nSIN \n\nTHA \n\nTAP \n\nUSA \n\n0.12 \n\n0.44 \n\n0.18 \n\n0.20 \n\n0.19 \n\n0.28 \n\n0.44 \n\n0.20 \n\n0.22 \n\n0.11 \n\n0.26 \n\n0.57 \n\nManufacturing \n\n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n\nServices \n\n0.54 \n\n2.08 \n\n0.49 \n\n1.41 \n\n0.64 \n\n0.29 \n\n0.73 \n\n0.34 \n\n0.74 \n\n0.43 \n\n1.10 \n\n0.57 \n\n0.50 \n\n1.79 \n\n0.41 \n\n1.24 \n\n0.54 \n\n0.22 \n\n0.58 \n\n0.31 \n\n0.69 \n\n0.31 \n\n0.86 \n\n0.43 \n\n0.73 \n\n2.05 \n\n0.44 \n\n2.17 \n\n0.83 \n\n0.87 \n\n1.21 \n\n0.43 \n\n0.84 \n\n1.36 \n\n1.51 \n\n0.88 \n\n4.84 \n\n4.02 \n\n3.43 \n\n2.59 \n\n0.46 \n\n0.13 \n\n1.95 \n\n0.66 \n\n1.21 \n\n0.49 \n\n1.50 \n\n1.05 \n\n0.33 \n\n1.34 \n\n0.36 \n\n1.03 \n\n0.71 \n\n0.28 \n\n0.43 \n\n0.27 \n\n0.40 \n\n0.40 \n\n1.13 \n\n0.38 \n\nOthers \n\n0.79 \n\n1.39 \n\n0.92 \n\n1.52 \n\n0.62 \n\n0.68 \n\n0.99 \n\n0.60 \n\n0.46 \n\n0.53 \n\n0.55 \n\n0.54 \n\nMining and \nquarrying \nElectricity, gas, and \nwater \n\n12.0\n1 \n\n2.56 \n\n1.90 \n\n3.66 \n\n1.87 \n\n0.76 \n\n1.61 \n\n11.2 \n\n1.80 \n\n0.38 \n\n3.23 \n\n3.64 \n\n0.91 \n\n2.77 \n\n1.13 \n\n3.74 \n\n2.38 \n\n4.70 \n\n3.69 \n\n3.22 \n\n2.36 \n\n4.72 \n\n6.01 \n\n3.42 \n\nConstruction \n\n0.36 \n\n0.78 \n\n0.42 \n\n1.17 \n\n0.46 \n\n0.51 \n\n0.23 \n\n0.32 \n\n0.34 \n\n0.18 \n\n0.29 \n\n0.34 \n\nAggregate \neconomy \n\n0.44 \n\n1.95 \n\n0.48 \n\n0.60 \n\n0.67 \n\n0.46 \n\n0.78 \n\n0.36 \n\n0.77 \n\n0.40 \n\n0.98 \n\n0.61 \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 computations based on Groningen Growth and Development Centre 10-Sector Database. \n\nFigure 4: Ratio of Service to Manufacturing Labor Productivity in 2005 \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 computations based on Groningen Growth and Development Centre 10-Sector Database. \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\nWithin  the  service  sector,  for  most  economies,  the  levels  of  labor  productivity  across \nservice branches are quite diverse.

Aggregate evidence from 11 Asian economies and the US shows that \nthere is a negative relationship between the overall labor productivity growth rate of the \neconomy and the employment share of the service sector in terms of employment. This \naffirms the relatively low productivity growth in the service sector.  \n\n \n\nAgriculture, \nhunting, forestry, \nand fishing \n\nWholesale and \nretail trade, and \nrestaurants \nTransport, \nstorage, and \ncommunications \nFinance, real \nestate, and \nbusiness services \nCommunity and \ngovernment \nservices \n\nMining and \nquarrying \nElectricity, gas, \nand water \n\nAggregate \neconomy \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\nFigure 5: Service Sector Employment and Aggregate Labor Productivity Growth \nfor 11 Asian Economies and the United States \n\n \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 illustration based on Groningen Growth and Development Centre 10-Sector Database. \n\nNevertheless, \u201ctertiarization\u201d is not necessarily an obstacle to overall labor productivity \ngrowth  in  an  economy.  In  India  and  Malaysia,  for  example,  labor  productivity  for \nservices grew faster than for manufacturing. \n\nTable  2  shows  labor  productivity  growth  by  four  service  branches.  The  transport, \nstorage, and communications branch presents labor productivity growth rates similar to \nor  even  higher  than  those  of  the  manufacturing  sector  in  most  of  the  11  Asian \neconomies  (and  the  US).  Here,  Indonesia  is  one  notable  exception  in  that  labor \nproductivity  growth  in  the  transport,  storage,  and  communications  branch  was  even \nlower than the average growth rate in the service sector. Note that this analysis does \nnot  take  into  account  the  indirect  effects  of  these  services  activities  on  productivity  in \nother sectors. \n\nOther  service  activities  also  show  dynamic  productivity  growth  in  a  number  of \neconomies.  For  example,  wholesale  and  retail  trade,  and  the  hotel  and  restaurant \nservice  branches  in  India  and  Singapore  experienced  very  high  labor  productivity \ngrowth.  In  Japan  and  Malaysia,  the  finance,  insurance,  real  estate,  and  business \nservices  had  high  labor  productivity  growth.  In  contrast,  in  Indonesia,  the  Republic  of \nKorea, and Thailand, the finance, insurance, real estate, and business services sectors \nshowed negative labor productivity growth rates. This reflects the impacts of the Asian \nfinancial crisis in 1997\u20131998.  \n\n2.5  Shift-Share Analysis \n\nIn this section  we  adopt  the technique  of \u201cshift-share\u201d  analysis  to  examine  empirically \nthe impact of tertiarization on aggregate productivity growth. Shift-share analysis shows \nhow  aggregate  labor  productivity  growth  is  linked  to  differential  growth  of  labor \nproductivity in individual sectors and the reallocation of labor between sectors. \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\nIt  uses  an  accounting  technique  to  decompose  aggregate  labor  productivity  growth \nover  a  period  of  time  into  a  \u201cwithin  effect\u201d  (labor  productivity  growth  within  each \nindustry), and a \u201cshift effect\u201d or \u201cstructural change effect\u201d (labor productivity growth due \nto employment shifts toward more productive industries).  \n\nRecent  papers  such  as  Maudos  et  al.  (2008),  Maroto-S\u00e1nchez  and  Cuadrado-Roura \n(2009), Timmer and de Vries (2009), McMillian and Rodrik (2011), and de Vries et al. \n(2012)  have  used  shift-share  analysis  to  examine  the  impact  of  structural  change  on \neconomic growth.  \n\nWe  adopt  the  same  technique  to  analyze  the  role  of  tertiarization  for  aggregate \nproductivity growth in the Asian economies.  \n\n \n\nThe  equation  shows  that  the  overall  growth  of  labor  productivity  in  an  economy  is \ndivided into two components. The first is the contribution from productivity growth within \n\nin  each  sector \nindividual  sectors \n(\u201cwithin effect\u201d). The second is the contribution from labor reallocation across different \nsectors  (\u201cstructural  change  effect\u201d).  The  second  term  is  the  change  of  employment \nshares multiplied by productivity levels at the end of the time period across sectors.5 \n\n weighted  by  the  share  of  employment \n\nThe contribution of each sector in the structural change effect can be either positive or \nnegative,  depending  on  whether  a  sector  is  expanding  or  shrinking.  When  the \ncontributions  from  individual  sectors  are  aggregated,  the  structural  change  term \nbecomes  negative,  lowering  economy-wide  productivity  growth,  if  the  labor  displaced \nfrom high-productivity growth sectors moves to low-productivity growth sectors.  \n\nTable 3 presents the results of the shift-share analysis using data from 1990 to 2005, \nconstructed from the data of nine sectors for the major Asian economies and the US.   \n\n                                                \n5 The  structural  change  term  is  again  divided  into  two  components:  the  change  of  employment  shares \nmultiplied by productivity levels at the beginning end of the time period (\u201cstatic structural change\u201d ) and \nthe  interaction  between  the  change  in  employment  shares  and  the  productivity  growth  in  individual \nsectors  (\u201cdynamic  structural  change\u201d).  The  results  of  shift-share  analysis  with  static  and  dynamic \nstructural change terms are available from the corresponding author upon request. \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\nTable 3: Decomposition of Labor Productivity Growth, 1990\u20132005 \n\nTotal \n\nWithin \n\nStructural Change \n \n0.95 \n-0.17 \n1.66 \n \n1.23 \n-0.91 \n2.28 \n \n1.04 \n0.33 \n0.77 \n \n0.97 \n0.17 \n0.62 \n \n-0.01 \n-0.71 \n0.77 \n \n-1.37 \n-1.62 \n0.9 \n \n0.48 \n0.39 \n0.72 \n \n0.14 \n-0.09 \n0.56 \n \n-0.08 \n-0.81 \n0.78 \n \n1.64 \n1.01 \n1.07 \n \n0.53 \n-0.42 \n1.22 \n \n-0.29 \n-0.59 \n0.42 \n\n \n7.46 \n3.21 \n1.8 \n\n1.99 \n0.7 \n1.14 \n\n1.7 \n0.76 \n0.46 \n\n3.17 \n0.63 \n2.05 \n\n1.41 \n1.08 \n0.46 \n\n5.19 \n3.69 \n0.51 \n\n3.52 \n1.05 \n1.6 \n\n0.81 \n0.24 \n0.23 \n\n3.72 \n1.8 \n1.75 \n\n1.36 \n0.72 \n-0.11 \n\n3.38 \n1.4 \n1.7 \n\n2.07 \n0.93 \n1.01 \n\nEconomy \n \nPeople\u2019s Republic \nof China \n\nHong Kong, China \n\nIndonesia \n\nIndia \n\nJapan \n\nRepublic of Korea \n\nMalaysia \n\nPhilippines \n\nSingapore \n\nThailand \n\nTaipei,China \n\nUnited States \n\nSector \n \nAll economy \nManufacturing \nServices \n\nAll economy \nManufacturing \nServices \n\nAll economy \nManufacturing \nServices \n\nAll economy \nManufacturing \nServices \n\nAll economy \nManufacturing \nServices \n\nAll economy \nManufacturing \nServices \n\nAll economy \nManufacturing \nServices \n\nAll economy \nManufacturing \nServices \n\nAll economy \nManufacturing \nServices \n\nAll economy \nManufacturing \nServices \n\nAll economy \nManufacturing \nServices \n\nAll economy \nManufacturing \nServices \n\n \n8.42 \n3.04 \n3.46 \n\n3.22 \n-0.2 \n3.43 \n\n2.74 \n1.1 \n1.23 \n\n4.14 \n0.8 \n2.68 \n\n1.4 \n0.38 \n1.23 \n\n3.82 \n2.07 \n1.41 \n\n4 \n1.43 \n2.31 \n\n0.94 \n0.15 \n0.79 \n\n3.64 \n1 \n2.53 \n\n3.01 \n1.74 \n0.97 \n\n3.91 \n0.99 \n2.92 \n\n1.78 \n0.34 \n1.42 \n\n14 \n \n\nSource: Author\u2019s estimates. \n\nThe  results  show  that  the  within  effect  dominates  the  effects  of  structural  changes  in \nmost of the Asian economies. Nevertheless, structural change has made a significant \ncontribution  to  the  overall  growth  of  labor  productivity  in  several  Asian  economies \nincluding  Hong  Kong,  China;  Indonesia;  and  Thailand.  McMillian  and  Rodrik  (2011) \nargue  that  Asia  is  outstanding  not  so  much  in  productivity  growth  within  individual \nsectors,  but  in  the  broad  pattern  of  structural  change.  But,  clearly  the  strong  labor \nproductivity growth in individual industries has been a salient feature of Asian economic \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\ngrowth,  while  structural  change  has  also  contributed  positively  to  labor  productivity \ngrowth in many Asian economies.  \n\nTable  3  demonstrates  the  importance  of  the  service  sector  in  structural  change  and \naggregate  productivity  growth.  In  the  industrialized  Asian  economies,  including  Hong \nKong, China; Japan; the Republic of Korea; Singapore; and Taipei,China; the structural \nchange  effect  of  the  manufacturing  sector  was  negative  because  they  experienced \nshifts of employment from manufacturing to the service sectors. Nevertheless, because \nthe  service  sector  contributed  positively  to  the  overall  structural  change  effect  due  to \nthe increase in service sector employment, the overall structural change effect became \neither small or positive.  \n\nFor the latecomers, including the PRC, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, both \nthe  manufacturing  and  service  sectors  contributed  positively  to  aggregate  growth  in \nterms of the structural change effect because these economies experienced increases \nin employment in both the manufacturing and service sectors during the period.   \n\nFor some economies, the service sector dominates the manufacturing sector in terms \nof contribution to aggregate labor productivity growth due to the strong positive  within \nand  structural  change  effects  of  the  service  sector.  In  Hong  Kong,  China;  India; \nMalaysia;  and  Taipei,China;  the  service  sector  contributed  more  to  the  overall  within \neffect aggregate growth than the manufacturing sector. In these economies, the strong \npositive  within  and  structural  change  effects  of  the  service  sector  contributed \nsignificantly to aggregate productivity growth. \n\n3.  SIMULATION OF THE EFFECTS OF SERVICE \n\nSECTOR PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH \n\nThis  section  investigates  the  effects  of  future  changes  in  service  sector  productivity \ngrowth  on  structural  change  and  economic growth  in  Asian  economies. The  empirical \nresults  in  the  previous  sections  show  that  service  sector  productivity  growth  can  be a \npotential engine of economic growth in Asian economies. However, faster productivity \ngrowth  in  the  service  sector  can  have  significant  spillovers  to  other  sectors  through \ninter-industry \nfactor  movements,  and  consumption  and \ninvestment dynamics. It can also have spillovers across the border through trade and \nfinancial linkages.  \n\ninput\u2013output \n\nlinkages, \n\nThe  complete  analysis  requires  an empirically  based  global  intertemporal  multi-sector \ngeneral equilibrium model (a large scale DSGE model). We adopt a model, called the \nG-Cubed  model,  to  explore  what  happens  if  labor  productivity  rises  in  the  service \nsector in individual Asian economies and then across all Asian economies at the same \ntime.  \n\n3.1  The Model \n\nThe model used in this paper is the G-Cubed model, which is an intertemporal general \nequilibrium  model  of  the  world  economy.  The  theoretical  structure  is  outlined  in \nMcKibbin  and  Wilcoxen  (2013)  and  more  details  can  be  found  in  the  Appendix.  A \nnumber of studies, summarized in McKibbin and Vines (2000), show that the G-Cubed \nmodeling approach has been useful in assessing a range of issues across a number of \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\neconomies  since  the  mid-1980s.6 Some  of  the  principal  features  of  the  model  are  as \nfollows. \n\nThe  model  is  based  on  explicit  intertemporal  optimization  by  the  agents  (consumers \nand firms) in each economy. In contrast to static CGE models, time and dynamics are \nof fundamental importance in the G-Cubed model. The G-Cubed model is known as a \nDSGE  (dynamic  stochastic  general  equilibrium)  model  in  the  macroeconomics \nliterature  and  as  an  intertemporal  general  equilibrium  (IGE)  model  in  the  computable \ngeneral equilibrium literature. The main difference from the small-scale DSGE models \nnow  popular  at  central  banks  is  the  large  amount  of  sectoral  disaggregation  and \nconsiderable degree of economy disaggregation. \n\nIn order to track the macro time series, the behavior of agents is modified to allow for \nshort-run deviations from optimal behavior either due to myopia or to restrictions on the \nability of households and firms to borrow at the risk-free bond rate on government debt. \nThus, aggregate consumption is a weighted average of consumption based on wealth \n(current  asset  valuation and  expected future  after-tax  labor  income)  and consumption \nbased  on  current  disposable  income.7 Similarly,  aggregate  investment  is  a  weighted \naverage of investment based on Tobin\u2019s Q (a market valuation of the expected future \nchange in the marginal product of capital relative to the cost) and investment based on \na  backward  looking  version  of  Q.  In  the  model  software,  it  is  possible  to  change  the \ninformation set of forward-looking agents after a scenario begins to unfold. \n\nThe  model  allows  for  short-run  nominal  wage rigidity  (by  different  degrees  in  different \neconomies)  and,  therefore,  allows  for  significant  periods  of  unemployment  depending \non  the  labor  market  institutions  in  each  economy.  Equilibrium  between  aggregate \ndemand and aggregate output is maintained by flexible prices, which causes demand \nto  adjust  together  with  short-term  supply.  There  is  explicit  treatment  of  the  holding  of \nfinancial  assets,  including  money.  Money  is  introduced  into  the  model  through  a \nrestriction that households require money to purchase goods. \n\nGlobal  accounting  identities  are  imposed  on  the  model  so,  for  example,  for  every \nborrower  there  is  a  lender,  thereby  avoiding  the  fallacy  of  composition.  Likewise,  the \nmodel  gives  a  careful  treatment  of  stock-flow  relations,  such  as  the  accumulation  of \ncurrent  account  deficits  into  foreign  claims  on  domestic  output,  which  has  to  be \nserviced by future trade surpluses. On the fiscal side, which is the focus of this study, \nthe accumulation of fiscal deficits into government debt has to be serviced from future \nrevenues\u2014though it does not have to be completely paid off. \n\nThe model  distinguishes  between  the  stickiness of  physical  capital  within  sectors  and \nwithin  economies,  and  the  flexibility  of  financial  capital,  which  immediately  flows  to \nwhere  expected  returns  are  highest.  This  important  distinction  leads  to  a  critical \ndifference  between  the  quantity  of  physical  capital  that  is  available  at  any  time  to \nproduce goods  and  services,  and the  valuation  of that  capital  as  a  result of decisions \nabout the allocation of financial capital. \n\nAs a result of this structure, the G-Cubed model contains rich dynamic behavior, driven \nby  asset  accumulation  on  the  one  hand,  and  by  wage  adjustment  to  a  neoclassical \nsteady  state  on  the  other.  It  embodies  a  wide  range  of  assumptions  about  individual \n                                                \n6 These  issues  include:  German  unification  in  the  early  1990s;  fiscal consolidation  in  Europe  in  the  mid-\n1990s; the formation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); the Asian crisis; and the \nproductivity boom in the US. \n\n7 Once  the  level  of  overall  consumption  has  been  determined,  spending  is  allocated  among  goods  and \nservices  according  to  a  two-tier  constant  elasticity  of  substitution  (CES)  utility  function.

Asia,  Japan,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  the  PRC,  India,  and  Indonesia  are \nincluded as individual economies and the other economies are included as the rest of \nAsia.  Each  economy  has  six  sectors  (energy,  mining,  agriculture,  manufacturing \ndurables,  manufacturing  non-durables,  and  services)  as  well  as  a  generic  capital-\nproducing  sector  in  each  economy  that  draws  largely  on  the  durable  manufacturing \nsector for inputs (Table 5).  \n\nTable 5: Sectors of Production in Each Economy \n\nEnergy  \nMining \nAgriculture \n\nDurable manufacturing \nNon-durable manufacturing \nServices \n\nSource: McKibbin and Wilcoxen (2013). \n\nIn  this  model,  each  of  the  six  sectors  is  represented  by  a  price-taking  firm,  which \nchooses  variable  inputs  and  its  level  of  investment  in  order  to  maximize  its  stock \nmarket  value.  Each  firm\u2019s  production  technology  is  represented  by  a  tier-structured \nconstant elasticity of substitution (CES) function. At the top tier, output is a function of \ncapital, labor, energy, and materials: \n\nQ\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\nO\n = A    \ni\ni\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\u2211\n\nj=K,L,E,M\n\n1\nO\n\u03c3\ni\n\nO\n\u2212\n\u03c3\n1\ni\nO\n\u03c3\ni\n\nX\n\nij\n\n(\nO\n\u03b4\nij\n\n)\n\nO\n\u03c3\ni\nO\n\u03c3\ni\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n \n\nwhere Qi is the output of industry I, Xij is industry i\u2019s use of input j, and Ai\nO reflects the level of technology, \u03c3i\nare parameters.

The functional form used for \n\nthese tiers is identical except that the parameters of the energy tier are Ai\n\nE\n\nij\u03b4\n\nE , \n\n, and \n\n\u03c3i\n\nE, and those of the materials tier are Ai\n\nM, \n\n, and \u03c3i\n\nM. \n\nM\n\nij\u03b4\n\nThe  goods  and  services  purchased  by  firms  are,  in  turn,  aggregates  of  imported  and \ndomestic commodities which are taken to be imperfect substitutes. We assume that all \nagents in the economy have identical preferences over foreign and domestic varieties \nof  each  commodity.  We  represent  these  preferences  by  defining  12  composite \ncommodities  that  are  produced  from  imported  and  domestic  goods.  Each  of  these \ncommodities, Yi, is a CES function of inputs domestic output, Qi, and imported goods, \nMi.  For  example,  the  mining  products  purchased  by  agents  in  the  model  are  a \ncomposite of imported and domestic mining. By constraining all agents in the model to \nhave the same preferences over the origin of goods, we require that, for example, the \nagricultural  and  service  sectors  have  identical  preferences  over  domestic  energy  and \nenergy imported from the Middle East.8 This accords with the input\u2013output data we use \nand  allows  a  very  convenient  nesting  of  production,  investment,  and  consumption \ndecisions. \n\nIn each sector the capital stock changes according to the rate of fixed capital formation \n(Ji) and the rate of geometric depreciation (\u03b4i): \n\nWe  assume  that  the  investment  process  is  subject  to  rising  marginal  costs  of \ninstallation. To formalize this we adopt Uzawa\u2019s approach by assuming that in order to \ninstall J units of capital a firm must buy a larger quantity, I, that depends on its rate of \ninvestment (J/K): \n\n\uf026\n J = K\ni\n\ni\n\n\u03b4\u2212\nK \ni\n\ni\n\n \n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n+ = I\ni\n\uf8ed\n\n1\n\n\u03c6\ni\n2\n\ni\n\nJ\nK\n\ni\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\nJ \n\uf8f8\n\ni\n\n \n\nwhere  \u03c6  is  a  non-negative  parameter.  The  difference  between  J  and  I  may  be \ninterpreted  in  various  ways;  we  will  view  it  as  installation  services  provided  by  the \ncapital-goods vendor  \n\nThe  goal  of  each  firm  is  to  choose  its  investment  and  inputs  of  labor,  materials  and \nenergy  to  maximize  intertemporal  risk-adjusted  net-of-tax  profits.  Solving  the  top  tier \noptimization problem gives the firm\u2019s factor demands for labor, energy, and materials, \nand the optimal evolution of the capital stock (see the Appendix).  \n\nG-Cubed\u2019s  parameters  are  estimated  from  a  consistent  time  series  of  input\u2013output \ntables  for  the  United  States.  The  procedure  is  described  in  detail  in  McKibbin  and \nWilcoxen  (1999).  The  dataset  that  was  constructed  allowed  the  estimation  of  the \nmodel\u2019s parameters for the United States. The elasticity of substitution by sector and by \nlevel of nesting is estimated using the US data and this is applied to all economies. The \ndelta  share  parameters  are  calibrated  using  economy-specific  input  output  data  from \nGTAP.9 \n\n                                                \n8 This does not require that both sectors purchase the same amount of energy, or even that they purchase \n\nenergy at all; only that they both feel the same way about the origins of the energy they buy. \n9 See the GTAP database in Narayanan, G., Badri, Angel Aguiar, and Robert McDougall, eds. 2012. \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\nTable  6  and  Table  7  present  the  values  of  the  elasticities  of  substitution  \u03c3i\n\nO,  \u03c3i\n\nE,  \u03c3i\n\nM, \n\nO\n\nij\u03b4\n\nE\n\nij\u03b4\n\nM\n\nij\u03b4\n\n, \n\n,  and \n\n parameters  that  appear  on  the  production  side  of  the \nand  the \nmodel  (as  well  as  the  substitution  between  domestic  and  foreign  goods  and  between \neconomy of origin of foreign goods).

One  is  where  all  Asian  economies \n(PRC,  India,  Indonesia, Japan,  Republic  of  Korea,  and the  rest  of  Asia) experience  a \nrise  in  labor  productivity  growth  of  1  percentage  point  per  year.  The  increase  by  1 \npercentage  point  would  be  a  challenge  for  economies  such  as  India;  Malaysia;  and \nTaipei,China; which have already had relatively high service sector productivity growth \n(see Table 2). In contrast, for Japan and the Republic of Korea, which have low service \nsector productivity growth, there could be more potential to bring out such productivity \ngains  by  moving  toward  high-value  modern  services,  such  as  information  and \ncommunications  technology,  finance,  and  professional  business  services. 10  We \nassume the productivity shock occurs in 2014 and then persists until 2053, after which \nthe  shock  in  the  growth  rate  of  labor  productivity  growth  rate  decays  by  4%  per  year \n\n                                                \n10 ADB  (2012)  point  out  that  lack  of  human  capital,  inadequate  infrastructure,  and  restrictive  regulations \n\nare major bottlenecks for developing a modern service sector. \n\n21 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\nuntil  returning  to  baseline  in  2100. 11 We  then  compare  the  cases  where  all  Asian \neconomies  successfully  raise  productivity  growth  in  services  to  the  case  where  each \neconomy  in  Asia  experiences  productivity  growth  of  the  same  magnitude,  but  each \nindividually.  For  the  non-Asian  results  we  only  explore  the  spillovers  from  the \naggregate Asian growth experience.  \n\nHere, we consider the productivity shock only in the service sector. As a comparison, \nwe  also  present  results at  the  sectoral  level from  the third  simulation,  which  assumes \nthe  same \nto \nmanufacturing sectors (both durable and non-durable goods) rather than services. \n\nlabor  productivity  shock  across  Asian  economies,  but  applied \n\nThe  results  are  presented  in  Tables  8\u201311.  Each  table  shows  the  deviation  from  the \nbaseline of a range of variables at different points into the future. In Table 8 and Table \n9,  GDP,  consumption,  and  investment  are  expressed  as  percentage  deviations  from \nthe  baseline.  Trade  balance  is  the  percent  of  baseline  GDP  deviation  from  the \nbaseline.  Table  10  contains  results  for  the  percentage  deviation  in  sectoral  output  by \neconomy  over  time.  Table  11  shows  the  results  for  the  sectoral  percentage  deviation \nfrom the baseline in employment by sector over time. These results are also presented \nin a series of graphs in Figures 6\u20139. \n\n                                                \n11 The reason for the particular time path is to ensure the long-run steady state of the model is preserved \n\nand to enable a long period of more rapid growth in service sector productivity until around 2050. \n\n22 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n

and  Table  10  (and  Figures  6\u20138),  the  results  are  clear. \nOnce  the  surprise  rise  in  labor  productivity  of  the  service  sector  occurs,  there  is  a \nreallocation of inputs within each economy. Higher productivity in one sector eventually \nraises  GDP  across  the  economy,  although  the  presence  of  adjustment  costs  implies \nthat  initially  GDP  can  fall  as  inputs  are  reallocated.  Own  productivity  growth \noverwhelmingly  benefits  the  economy  experiencing  the  productivity  surge.  The \nmagnitude of GDP increase depends on the size of the service sector in the economy \nand  its  linkages  to  other  sectors,  especially  manufacturing  sectors.  In  an  individual \neconomy, higher labor productivity raises the return to capital in the service sector. This \ninduces an increase in investment in that sector. It also causes an increase in demand \nand therefore output in all sectors that feed into that sector (see Table 10 and Figure \n9).  In  the  model,  investment  goods  are  produced  by  a  capital-producing  sector  that \ndraws  largely  on  the  output  of  the  durable  manufacturing  sector  so  the  demand  for \ndurable manufacturing goods rises as part of the investment boom. This is true for the \ndomestically  produced goods  as  well  as for  imports. In  all  economies that  experience \nthe productivity increase, investment rises (Table 8). \n\nOver  time  all  economies  benefit  from  service  sector  productivity  growth  in  another \neconomy through the increase in national wealth, which is spread globally. The extent \nof  the  gain  depends  on  the  linkages  between  economies  outside  of  Asia  and  the \neconomies experiencing the productivity surge. For example, Australia gains far more \nthan the eurozone because of strong trade linkages, especially for intermediate inputs \nin Asia. Germany gains more than the rest of the eurozone because of the exports of \n\n25 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\ndurable goods for  capital  investment  purposes from Germany  to  Asia (particularly  the \nPRC).  \n\nThe increase in investment is initially funded by a rise in aggregate savings (or a fall in \nconsumption)  as  backward-looking  agents  do  not  fully  incorporate  higher  wealth  into \ntheir  consumption  decisions  in  the  short  term.  The  higher  investment  is  also  partly \nfunded by a capital inflow, with financial capital attracted to the higher return on capital \nin growing economies. This capital inflow appreciates the exchange rate in each Asian \neconomy and worsens the trade balance (which is the counterpart of the capital inflow). \nThe balance between financing domestically and through foreign capital varies across \nAsian  economies  depending  on  the  scale  of  capital  inflow  required  to  build  the  new \ncapital stock. It ranges from large in Japan, to small in the Republic of Korea and the \nPRC (where capital controls lessen the available inflow).  \n\nFigure 6: GDP Effects of a Services Productivity Shock \n\n \n\n \n\nGDP = gross domestic product, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, US = United States. \nSource: Authors\u2019 estimates. \n\n26 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\nFigure 7: Investment Effects of a Services Productivity Shock \n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, US = United States. \nSource: Authors\u2019 estimates. \n\n \n\n27 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\nFigure 8: Consumption Effects of a Services Productivity Shock \n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, US = United States. \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 estimates. \n\n \n\n28 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\nFigure 9: Sectoral Output and Employment Effects of a Services Productivity \nShock \n(%) \n\n(a) People\u2019s Republic of China \n\n(b) Japan \n\n(c) Republic of Korea \n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSource: Authors\u2019 estimates. \n\n29 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\nWe see  that  GDP  rises  in  all  Asian  economies  after the first  year  and  in the  long  run \n(Table  8  and  Figure  6).  In  non-Asian  economies  such  as  the  United  States  and \nAustralia the results vary over time. The initial relocation of capital from the US lowers \nUS GDP below the baseline for 20 years, but eventually the higher demand from Asia \nthrough high wealth raises the demand for US goods. Australia is different because it is \nmore highly integrated into Asian production, particularly through the supply of mining \nand  energy  goods,  which  is  very  different to  the  US.  Australia  is  more  integrated  into \nAsian  production  flows  and  the  trade  benefits  of  high  growth  in  Asia  dominate  the \ncapital  outflows  from  Australia.  This  illustrates  that  the  spillovers  between  economies \noutside Asia and within Asia depend very much on trade patterns and the nature of the \ngoods traded. In particular, Australia experiences a surge in mining and energy exports \nthat  feed  into  the  faster  growing  Asian  capital  stocks.  Thus,  Australia\u2019s  GDP  rises \ncontinuously from the productivity surge in Asia whereas US GDP is below baseline for \nmore  than  20  years  because the  capital relocation  effect  outweighs the positive  trade \neffects. \n\nReturning  to  the  sectoral  level  (Table  10,  Table  11,  and  Figure  9),  the  results  differ \nsubstantially  across  the  Asian  economies.  Because  the  shock  is  a  rise  in  labor \naugmenting  technical  change  in  the  service  sector,  fewer  workers  are  needed  to \nproduce  the  same  level  of  output.  Labor  demand  tends  to  fall  in  all  service  sectors \nexperiencing the productivity surge, thus freeing up labor to flow into other parts of the \neconomy.  This  tends  to  raise  the  marginal  product  of  capital  in  these  sectors.  In \nparticular the demand for capital goods that are needed to build the capital stock for the \nexpanding  service  sector  raises  the  demand  for  durable  manufacturing  goods  well  in \nexcess  of  other  sectors.  This  result  is  found  in  each  Asian  economy,  although  to  a \ndifferent extent depending on the capital intensity of the service sector relative to other \nsectors.  The  fact  that  the  durable  goods  manufacturing  sector  is  very  different  to  the \nnon-durable  goods  manufacturing  sector  (which  responds  more  like  agriculture)  is  an \nimportant  result  and suggests  that  an  aggregate manufacturing  sector might mask  an \nimportant  adjustment  process  especially  when  the  capital  accumulation  process  is \nendogenous as it is in G-Cubed.  \n\nLooking  more  closely  at  individual  economy  results  across  the  major  sectors,  we  see \nthat  in  Table  10  for  the  PRC  there  is  initially  a  rise  in  the  output  of  the  durable \nmanufacturing sector as new capital goods are built for the expanding services sectors. \nThe expansion of capital goods is front loaded compared to the persistent rise in labor \nproductivity in the service sector. The employment effects in durable manufacturing are \neven larger than for other sectors as workers move out of services into the expanding \ndurable manufacturing sector (Figure 9).  \n\nJapan (Table 10 and Figure 9) shows an even larger flow of workers out of the service \nsector into other sectors and particularly into the durable goods sector. This is because \ndurable  goods  is  a  sector  with  a  large  comparative  advantage  in  Japan,  with  Japan \nbeing  a  major  exporter  of  durable  goods  throughout  Asia  and  globally.  Japan  is  also \nmuch  more  labor  intensive  in  services  than  the  other  Asia  economies  (see  Table  7, \nparameter  delta_k),  hence  input  costs  fall  by  more  in  Japanese  services,  and  more \nlabor  flows  into  other  sectors  that  are  more  capital  intensive  than  in  other  Asian \neconomies.  Thus  the  demand  for  durable  goods  for  investment  purposes  increases \nsignificantly. The Republic of Korea also experiences a large rise in durables output for \nsimilar  reasons  to  Japan,  but  other  economies  with  less  domestic  capital  production \nsuch  as  the  PRC,  India,  and  Indonesia  have  a  much  smaller  expansion  of  durable \ngoods  production  than  Japan  or  the  Republic  of  Korea  with  some  of  the  expansion \nspilling over into non-durable goods in the PRC.  \n\n30 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\nIn Table 10 and Table 11 we also present results for the Asia-wide rise in productivity \nin the two manufacturing sectors in the model\u2014durable and non-durable goods. Labor \nproductivity  growth  in  durable  goods  reduces  the  costs  of  purchasing  capital  goods \nthroughout  Asia  because  this  sector  largely  produces  the  capital  goods  that  each \nsector  purchases  for  investment.  As  the  cost  of  capital  goods  falls,  investment  rises \nand  GDP  rises.  Capital-intensive  sectors  (especially  mining)  gain  most  from  this \nreduction in capital goods prices. In addition there is the relocation effect of labor from \nthe manufacturing sectors into the rest of the economy that parallels the adjustment for \nthe  shock  to  service  sector  productivity.  In  the  longer  run,  manufacturing  productivity \ngrowth  increases  employment  in the  service  industry  but  reduces  employment growth \nin agriculture in all economies. \n\n4.  CONCLUDING REMARKS \n\nThis  paper  has  empirically  explored  the  historical  experience  of  sectoral  growth  in \nmajor Asian economies with a focus on the performance of the service sector relative \nto  the  manufacturing  sector  and  the  implication  for  overall  economic  growth.  It  has \nfound  evidence  of  significant  catch-up  in  a  number  of  sectors  including  the  service \nsector, but there are a wide variety of experiences in each economy. It has also found \nthat a substantial gap still remains in labor productivity between the service sectors in \nAsia and the United States.  \n\nAlthough  lower  labor  productivity  in  the  service  sector  relative  to  the  manufacturing \nsector has in general hampered overall economic growth in Asia, the evidence shows \nthat  in  several  Asian  economies,  the  service  sector  has  made  a  significantly  positive \ncontribution  to  aggregate  labor  productivity  growth,  both  through  own  productivity \nthe \ngrowth  and  structural  change  effects,  exceeding \nmanufacturing  sector.  In  addition,  some  \u201cmodern  services\u201d  industries  such  as  the \ntransportation,  storage,  communications, \nintermediation,  and  business \nfinancial \nservices have experienced higher productivity growth. \n\nthe  net  contribution  of \n\nOverall,  empirical  evidence  from  the  historical  data  suggests  enormous  potential  for \nservice  sector  productivity  growth  in  Asia  if  policies  can  be  adopted  to  enhance  the \ncatch-up in services to be more like the experience with the manufacturing sector. One \ncritical  question  is  whether  enhancing  productivity  in  the  service  sector  can  play  the \nrole  of  a  second  growth  engine  to  lead  strong  and  sustainable  growth  in  Asia  in  the \nfuture.  We  have  addressed  this  question  by  exploring  simulations  of  a  multi-sectoral \ngeneral equilibrium model. We find that faster productivity growth in the service sector \nin  Asia  can  significantly  benefit  all  sectors,  contributing  to  more  balanced  and \nsustainable  growth  of  Asian  economies.  The  simulations  show  diverse  dynamic \nadjustment  across  economies.  We  find  that  in  contrast  to  the  simpler  models  of \neconomic growth, a key part of the structural adjustment story in the freeing up of labor \nfrom  the  service  sector  and  a  rise  in  the  demand  for  durable  manufacturing  goods \nrequired  building  the  physical  capital  stock  that  is  induced  by  the  productivity  surge. \nThus both the service and durable goods sectors experience rapid growth in output, but \nemployment  shifts  mainly  toward  the  durable  goods  sector  during  the  adjustment \nprocess. This is particularly important in economies such as the Republic of Korea and \nJapan,  which  have  high  productivity  in  the  durable  manufacturing  sector  due  to  their \ncomparative advantage and openness to international trade in that sector. \n\nThe results of this paper suggest that the simple aggregate models and the models of \nlimited sectoral interactions may miss an important dynamic story of productivity growth \nin the service sector and capital accumulation in an integrated global economy.

Moreover,  policy  implications  of  the  paper \ncan  be  strengthened  by  investigating  the major  determinants,  including  policy  factors, \nof service sector productivity growth in individual economies.

This  appendix  draws  heavily  on  the  exposition  in  McKibbin  and \nWilcoxen (2013). \n\nThe version of the model used in this paper is the six-sector model with economy and \nsectoral coverage set out in Table 7 and Table 8.  \n\nEach  economy  or  region  in  the  model  consists  of  several  economic  agents: \nhouseholds,  the  government,  the  financial  sector,  and  six  production  sectors.  The \ntheoretical  structure  is  outlined  below.  To  keep  the  notation  as  simple  as  possible, \nvariables are not subscripted by economy except where needed for clarity. Throughout \nthe discussion all quantity variables will be normalized by the economy\u2019s endowment of \neffective labor units. Thus, the model\u2019s long run steady state will represent an economy \nin  a  balanced  growth  equilibrium.  The  solution  software  linearizes  around  the  initial \nconditions in 2010 rather than the steady state. \n\nFirms \n\nEach  of  the  six  sectors  is  represented  by  a  price-taking  firm  that  chooses  variable \ninputs  and  its  level  of  investment  in  order  to  maximize  its  stock  market  value.  Each \nfirm\u2019s  production  technology  is  represented  by  a  tier-structured  constant  elasticity  of \nsubstitution (CES) function. At the top tier, output is a function of capital, labor, energy, \nand materials: \n\nQ\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\nO\n = A    \ni\ni\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\u2211\n\nj=K,L,E,M\n\n1\nO\n\u03c3\ni\n\nO\n\u2212\n\u03c3\n1\ni\nO\n\u03c3\ni\n\nX\n\nij\n\n(\nO\n\u03b4\nij\n\n)\n\nO\n\u03c3\ni\nO\n\u03c3\ni\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(1) \n\nO\n\nij\u03b4\n\nwhere Qi is the output of industry i, Xij is industry i\u2019s use of input j, and Ai\n\u03c3i\n\nO  are  parameters.  Ai\n\nO, \n, and \nO  is  the  elasticity  of \n\nO  reflects  the  level  of  technology,  \u03c3i\nij\u03b4\n\nO\n\n parameters  reflect  the  weights  of  different  inputs  in \nsubstitution,  and  the \nproduction; the superscript o indicates that the parameters apply to the top, or \u201coutput\u201d, \ntier. Without loss of generality, we constrain \u03b4 to sum to 1.  \n\nAt  the  second  tier,  inputs  of  energy  and  materials,  XiE  and  XiM,  are  themselves  CES \naggregates  of  goods  and  services.  Energy  is  a  single  good  1  and  materials  is  an \naggregate of goods 2\u20136 (mining through services). The functional form used for these \nE, and \n\ntiers is identical to (1) except that the parameters of the energy tier are Ai\n\nij\u03b4\n\nE, \n\n\u03c3i\n\nE\n\n\u03c3iE, and those of the materials tier are Ai\n\nM\n\nij\u03b4\n\nM, \n\n, and \u03c3i\n\nM. \n\nThe  goods  and  services  purchased  by  firms  are,  in  turn,  aggregates  of  imported  and \ndomestic commodities, which are taken to be imperfect substitutes. We assume that all \nagents in the economy have identical preferences over foreign and domestic varieties \nof  each  commodity.  We  represent  these  preferences  by  defining  12  composite \ncommodities  that  are  produced  from  imported  and  domestic  goods.  Each  of  these \ncommodities, Yi, is a CES function of inputs domestic output, Qi, and imported goods, \n\n36 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\n \n\n \n\n\u221e\n\n\u222b\n\nt\n\nMi. 1  For  example,  the  mining  products  purchased  by  agents  in  the  model  are  a \ncomposite of imported and domestic mining. By constraining all agents in the model to \nhave the same preferences over the origin of goods, we require that, for example, the \nagricultural  and  service  sectors  have  identical  preferences  over  domestic  energy  and \nenergy imported from the Middle East.2 This accords with the input\u2013output data we use \nand  allows  a  very  convenient  nesting  of  production,  investment,  and  consumption \ndecisions. \n\nIn each sector, the capital stock changes according to the rate of fixed capital formation \n(Ji) and the rate of geometric depreciation (\u03b4i): \n\nFollowing  the  cost  of  adjustment  models  of  Lucas  (1967),  Treadway  (1969),  and \nUzawa  (1969)  we  assume  that  the  investment  process  is  subject  to  rising  marginal \ncosts of installation. To formalize this we adopt Uzawa\u2019s approach by assuming that in \norder to install J units of capital a firm must buy a larger quantity, I, that depends on its \nrate of investment (J/K): \n\n\uf026\nK  J = K\ni\n\n\u03b4\u2212\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n+ = I\ni\n\uf8ed\n\n1\n\n\u03c6\ni\n2\n\ni\n\nJ\nK\n\ni\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\nJ \n\uf8f8\n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(2) \n\n(3) \n\nwhere  \u03c6  is  a  non-negative  parameter.  The  difference  between  J  and  I  may  be \ninterpreted various ways; we will view it as installation services provided by the capital-\ngoods vendor  \n\nThe  goal  of  each  firm  is  to  choose  its  investment  and  inputs  of  labor,  materials,  and \nenergy  to  maximize  intertemporal  risk-adjusted  net-of-tax  profits.  For  analytical \ntractability, we assume that this problem is deterministic (equivalently, the firm could be \nassumed to believe its estimates of future variables with subjective certainty).

Investment \ngoods are supplied, in turn, by a 13th industry that combines labor and the outputs of \nother  industries  to  produce  raw  capital  goods.  We  assume  that  this  firm  faces  an \noptimization problem identical to those of the other 12 industries: it has a nested CES \nproduction function, uses inputs of capital, labor, energy, and materials in the top tier, \nincurs  adjustment  costs  when  changing  its  capital  stock,  and  earns  zero  profits.  The \nkey difference between it and the other sectors is that we use the investment column of \nthe input\u2013output table to estimate its production parameters. \n\nHouseholds \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHouseholds  have  three  distinct  activities  in  the  model:  they  supply  labor,  they  save, \nand  they  consume  goods  and  services.

One  side  effect  of  this  specification  is  that  it \nprevents  us  from  computing  an  equivalent  variation.  Since  the  behavior of  some  of the households is \ninconsistent, either because the households are at corner solutions or for some other reason, aggregate \nbehavior is inconsistent with the expenditure function derived from our utility function. \n\n7  The  use  of  the  CES  function  has  the  undesirable  effect  of  imposing  unitary  income  elasticities,  a \nrestriction usually rejected by data. An alternative would be to replace this specification with one derived \nfrom the linear expenditure system. \n\n40 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(25) \n\n(26) \n\nHousehold  capital  services  consist  of  the  service  flows  of  consumer  durables  plus \nresidential  housing.

This  problem  is  nearly  identical  to  the  investment \nproblem  faced  by  firms,  including  the  partial  adjustment  mechanism  outlined  in \nequations (13) and (14), and the results are very similar. The only important difference \nis that no variable factors are used in producing household capital services. \n\nThe Labor Market \n\nWe  assume  that  labor  is  perfectly  mobile  among  sectors  within  each  region  but  is \nimmobile  between  regions.  Thus,  wages  will  be  equal  across  sectors  within  each \nregion, but will generally not be equal between regions. In the long run, labor supply is \ncompletely  inelastic  and  is  determined  by  the  exogenous  rate  of  population  growth. \nLong  run  wages  adjust  to  move  each  region  to  full  employment.  In  the  short  run, \nhowever,  nominal  wages  are  assumed  to  adjust  slowly  according  to  an  overlapping \ncontracts model where wages are set based on current and expected inflation and on \nlabor  demand  relative  to  labor  supply.  This  can  lead  to  short-run  unemployment  if \nunexpected shocks cause the real wage to be too high to clear the labor market. At the \nsame time, employment can temporarily exceed its long-run level if unexpected events \ncause the real wage to be below its long-run equilibrium. \n\nGovernment \n\nWe  take  each  region\u2019s  real  government  spending  on  goods  and  services  to  be \nexogenous and assume that it is allocated among inputs in fixed proportions, which we \nset to 2006 values. Total government outlays include purchases of goods and services \nplus  interest  payments  on  government  debt,  investment  tax  credits,  and  transfers  to \nhouseholds.  Government  revenue  comes  from  sales  taxes,  corporate  and  personal \nincome  taxes,  and  from  sales  of  new  government  bonds.  In  addition,  there  can  be \nemissions. \ntaxes \n\nexternalities \n\ndioxide \n\ncarbon \n\nsuch \n\non \n\nas \n\n41 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\nThe  government  budget  constraint  may  be  written  in  terms  of  the  accumulation  of \npublic debt as follows: \n\n\uf026\n\u2212\n TR + G + Br = D = B\nT \n\nt\n\nt\n\nt\n\nt\n\nt\n\nt\n\nt\n\n \n\nwhere B is the stock of debt, D is the budget deficit, G is total government spending on \ngoods and services, TR is transfer payments to households, and T is total tax revenue \nnet of any investment tax credit. \n\nWe assume that agents will not hold government bonds unless they expect the bonds \nto be paid off eventually and accordingly impose the following transversality condition:  \n\nlim\n\u221e\u2192\n \ns\n\nesB\n)(\n\n\u2212\n\n(\n\nsR\n)(\n\n\u2212\n\n)\nsn\n\n = \n\n0\n\n  \n\n \n\nThis  prevents  per  capita  government  debt  from  growing  faster  than  the  interest  rate \nforever.

Otherwise,  the  government \nwould be unable to pay interest on the debt and agents would not be willing to hold it. \nTo ensure that (29) holds at all points in time we assume that the government levies a \nlump sum tax in each period equal to the value of interest payments on the outstanding \ndebt.9 In effect, therefore, any increase in government debt is financed by consols, and \nfuture  taxes  are  raised  enough  to  accommodate  the  increased  interest  costs.  Other \nfiscal closure rules are possible, such as requiring the ratio of government debt to GDP \nto be unchanged in the long run or that the fiscal deficit be exogenous with a lump sum \ntax  ensuring  this  holds.  These  closures  have  interesting  implications  but  are  beyond \nthe scope of this paper. \n\nFinancial Markets and the Balance of Payments \n\nThe 17 regions in the model are linked by flows of goods and assets. Flows of goods \nare  determined  by  the  import  demands  described  above.  These  demands  can  be \nsummarized  in  a  set  of  bilateral  trade  matrices  which  give  the  flows  of  each  good \nbetween exporting and importing economies. There is one 9x9 trade matrix for each of \nthe 12 goods. \n\nTrade  imbalances  are  financed  by  flows  of  assets  between  economies.

The  remainder, \ninterest payments on the base case debt, is financed by ordinary taxes. \n\n42 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\nversa.10 We  assume  asset  markets  are  perfectly  integrated  across  regions.  With  free \nmobility  of  capital,  expected  returns  on  loans  denominated  in  the  currencies  of  the \nvarious  regions  must  be  equalized  period  to  period  according  to  a  set  of  interest \narbitrage relations of the following form: \n\ni\n\nk\n\n+\n\n\u00b5\nk\n\ni =\n\nj\n\n+\n\n\u00b5\nj\n\n + \n\n\uf026\nE\n\nj\nk\nj\nE\nk\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(30) \n\nwhere ik and ij are the interest rates in economies k and j, \u00b5k and \u00b5j are exogenous risk \nj  is  the  exchange  rate  between \npremiums  demanded  by  investors  (possibly  0),  and  Ek\nthe currencies of the two economies.11 However, in cases where there are institutional \nrigidities to capital flows, the arbitrage condition does not hold and we replace it with an \nexplicit model of the relevant restrictions (such as capital controls). \n\nCapital  flows  may  take  the  form  of  portfolio  investment  or  direct  investment  but  we \nassume  these  are  perfectly  substitutable  ex  ante,  adjusting  to  the  expected  rates  of \nreturn  across  economies  and  across  sectors.  Within  each  economy,  the  expected \nreturns to each type of asset are equated by arbitrage, taking into account the costs of \nadjusting  physical  capital  stock  and  allowing  for  exogenous  risk  premiums.  However, \nbecause  physical  capital  is  costly  to  adjust,  any  inflow  of  financial  capital  that  is \ninvested  in  physical  capital  will  also  be  costly  to  shift  once  it  is  in  place.  This  means \nthat  unexpected  events  can  cause  windfall  gains  and  losses  to  owners  of  physical \ncapital  and  ex  post  returns  can  vary  substantially  across  economies  and  sectors.  For \nexample, if a shock lowers profits in a particular industry, the physical capital stock in \nthe sector will initially be unchanged but its financial value will drop immediately. \n\nMoney and Monetary Rules \nWe assume that money enters the model via a constraint on transactions.12 We use a \nmoney demand function in which the demand for real money balances is a function of \nthe value of aggregate output and short-term nominal interest rates: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(31) \n\n\u03b5\niPY = MON\n\n  \n\nwhere Y is aggregate output, P is a price index for Y, i is the interest rate, and \u03b5 is the \ninterest elasticity of money demand. Following McKibbin and Sachs (1991) we take \u03b5 to \nbe -0.6.  \n\nOn the supply side, the model includes an endogenous monetary response function for \neach  region.  Each  region\u2019s  central  bank  is  assumed  to  adjust  short-term  nominal \ninterest  rates  following  a  modified  Henderson-McKibbin-Taylor  rule  made  up  of  two \nequations.  The  first  is  a  desired  interest  rate  (id)  and  the  second  is  the  actual  policy \ninterest rate (it) which adjusts to the desired rate over time.  \n\n                                                \n10 Global  net  flows  of  private capital  are  constrained  to  be  0 at  all  times\u2014the  total of  all funds borrowed \nexactly equals the total funds lent.  As a theoretical matter this may seem obvious, but it is often violated \nin international financial data. \n\n11 The  one  exception  to this  is the  oil  exporting  region,  which  we  treat  as choosing its foreign lending in \n\norder to maintain a desired ratio of income to wealth. \n\n12 Unlike  other  components  of  the  model  we  simply  assume  this  rather  than  deriving  it  from  optimizing \nbehavior.  Money  demand  can  be  derived  from  optimization  under  various  assumptions:  money  gives \ndirect utility; it is a factor of production; or it must be used to conduct transactions. The distinctions are \nnot important for our purposes. \n\n43 \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\nADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\nThe two equations follow:  \n\n  (27a)    \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n(27b) \n\nThe  desired  interest  rate  (id)  evolves  as  a  function  of  actual  inflation  (\u03c0)  relative  to \n\nT\u03c0 ),  output  growth  (\u0394y)  relative  to  growth  of  potential  output  (\n\ntarget  inflation  (\n), \nnominal  income  (ny)  relative  to  target  nominal  income  (nyT  )and  the  change  in  the \nTe\u2206 ). The actual policy interest \nexchange rate (\u0394e) relative to the bank\u2019s target change (\nrate (it) adjusts gradually to the desired policy rate (id) and can be shifted exogenously \nin the short term by changing the exogenous component (ix). \n\nTy\u2206\n\nThe  parameters  in  the  monetary  response  function  vary  across  economies.  For \nexample,  economies  that  peg  their  exchange  rate  to  the  US  dollar  have  a  very  large \nvalue  for  \u03b24.  In  the  current  model  we  assume  that  nominal  income  targeting  is  the \nmajor policy rule given the results are forward looking and most economies will move \nover time to this type of rule. The rule also needs to be able to model unconventional \nmonetary policies in some advanced economies through adjustment to the exogenous \npart of the rule (ix). \n\nParameterization \n\nTo estimate G-Cubed\u2019s parameters we began by constructing a consistent time series \nof input\u2013output tables for the US. The procedure is described in detail in McKibbin and \nWilcoxen  (1999)  and  can  be  summarized  as  follows.  We  started  with  the  detailed \nbenchmark US input\u2013output transactions tables produced by the Bureau of Economic \nAnalysis (BEA) and converted them to a standard set of industrial classifications, then \naggregated  them  to  12  sectors.13 Second,  we  corrected  the  treatment  of  consumer \ndurables, which are included in consumption rather than investment in the US National \nIncome  and  Product  Accounts  and  the  benchmark  input\u2013output  tables.  Third,  we \nsupplemented  the  value  added  rows  of  the  tables  using  a  detailed  dataset  on  capital \nand  labor  input  by  industry  constructed  by  Dale  Jorgenson  and  his  colleagues. 14 \nFinally, we obtained prices for each good in each benchmark year from the output and \nemployment  dataset  constructed  by  the  Office  of  Employment  Projections  at  the \nBureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).  \n\nThis dataset allowed us to estimate the model\u2019s parameters for the US. To estimate the \nproduction  side  of  the  model,  we  began  with  the  energy  and  materials  tiers  because \nthey  have  constant  returns  to  scale  and  all  inputs  are  variable.  In  this  case  it  is \n\n                                                \n13 Converting the data to a standard basis was necessary because the sector definitions and accounting \n\nconventions used by the BEA have changed over time. \n\n14 Primary factors often account for half or more of industry costs so it is particularly important that this part \nof  the  dataset  be  constructed  as  carefully  as  possible.  From  the  standpoint  of  estimating  cost  and \nproduction functions, however, value added is the least satisfactory part of the benchmark input\u2013output \ntables. In the early tables, labor and capital are not disaggregated. In all years, the techniques used by \nthe BEA to construct implicit price deflators for labor and capital are subject to various methodological \nproblems. One example is that the income of proprietors is not split between capital and imputed labor \nincome  correctly.  The  Jorgenson  dataset  corrects  these  problems  and  is  the  work  of  several  people \nover many years. In addition to Dale Jorgenson, some of the contributors were L. Christensen, Barbara \nFraumeni,  Mun  Sing  Ho,  and  Dae  Keun  Park.  The  original  source  of  the  data  is  the  Fourteen \nComponents  of  Income  tape  produced  by  the  Bureau  of  Economic  Analysis.

In McKibbin and \nWilcoxen  (1999)  we  show  that  using  equation  (37)  biases  the  estimated  elasticity  of \nsubstitution  toward  unity  for  many  sectors  in  the  model  In  petroleum  refining,  for \nO,  is  0.54  while  in  the \nexample,  the  fixed-capital  estimate  for  the  top  tier  elasticity,  \u03c3i\nvariable  elasticity  case  it  is  1.04.  The  treatment  of  capital  thus  has  a  very  significant \neffect on the estimated elasticities of substitution. \n\nEstimating  parameters  for  regions  other  than  the  US  is  more  difficult  because  time-\nseries input\u2013output data is often unavailable. In part this is because some  economies \ndo  not  collect  the  data  regularly  and  in  part  because  many  of  G-Cubed\u2019s  geographic \nentities  are  regions  rather  than  individual  economies.  As  a  result,  we  impose  the \nrestriction  that  substitution  elasticities  within  individual  industries  are  equal  across \nregions.17 By doing so, we are able to use the US elasticity estimates everywhere. The \nshare parameters (\u03b4 in the equations above), however, are derived from regional input\u2013\noutput data taken from the GTAP 8 database and differ from one region to another. In \neffect,  we  are  assuming  that  all  regions  share  similar  but  not  identical  production \ntechnology.  This  is  intermediate  between  one  extreme  of  assuming  that  the  regions \nshare  common  technologies  and  the  other  extreme  of  allowing  the  technologies  to \ndiffer in arbitrary ways. The regions also differ in their endowments of primary factors, \ntheir government policies, and patterns of final demands. \n\nFinal  demand  parameters,  such  as  those  in  the  utility  function  or  in  the  production \nfunction  of  new  investment  goods  were  estimated  by  a  similar  procedure:  elasticities \nwere  estimated  from  US  data  and  share  parameters  were  obtained  from  regional \ninput\u2013output  tables.  Trade  shares  were  obtained  from  2009  United  Nations  Standard \nIndustry Trade Classification (SITC) data aggregated up from the four-digit level.18 The \ntrade elasticities are based on a survey of the literature and vary between 1 and 3.19. \nTable A1 contains some key parameters for the Asian economies in the model. \n\n                                                \n17 For  example,  the  top  tier  elasticity  of  substitution  is  identical  in  the  durable  goods  industries  of  Japan \nand  the  US.  This  approach  is  consistent  with  the  econometric  evidence  of  Kim  and  Lau  (1995).  This \nspecification  does  not  mean,  however,  that  the  elasticities  are  the  same  across  industries  within  an \neconomy. \n\n18 A full mapping of SITC codes into G-Cubed industries is available on request. \n \n\n46 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 490 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n      \n\n         Lee and McKibbin \n\nTable A1: Key Macro Parameters \n\nadapt \nint_elast \nlabgrow \nphi_1 \nphi_2 \nphi_3 \nphi_4 \nphi_5 \nphi_6 \nphi_y \nphi_z \ntimepref \nwage_p \nwage_q \ndelta \nfore_i \nfore_c \nmpc \nr0 \n\nSource: G-Cubed model database version 110V. \n\n \n\n0.35 \n-0.6 \n0.018 \n4 \n15 \n4 \n4 \n4 \n4 \n4 \n4 \n0.022 \n0.4 \n0.35 \n0.1 \n0.3 \n0.3 \n1 \n0.04 \n\n47 \n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "Jong-Wha Lee is Professor of Economics and Director of the Asiatic Research Institute, \nKorea  University.

The model allows for input\u2013\noutput linkages and capital movements across industries and economies, and consumption \nand investment dynamics. We find that faster productivity growth in the service sector in Asia \nbenefits  all  sectors  eventually,  and  contributes  to  the  sustained  and  balanced  growth  of \nAsian  economies,  but  the  dynamic  adjustment  is  different  across  economies.  This \nadjustment  depends  on  the  sectoral  composition  of  each  economy,  the  capital  intensity  of \neach sector, and the openness of each sector to international trade. In particular, during the \nadjustment  to  higher  services  productivity  growth,  there  is  a  significant  expansion  of  the \ndurable manufacturing sector that is required to provide the capital stock that accompanies \nthe higher aggregate economic growth rate. \n \nJEL Classification: J21, O11, O14, O41, O53 \n", " \n"]}
