While\nthese poverty measures have provided a good base for poverty analysis, the paper\nalso touches on the problems generated by the use of multiple methods. The\nrelease of the official poverty line by the Department of Census and Statistics\ncan be seen as a major step forward in the debate on poverty measurement in\nSri Lanka.", "I. INTRODUCTION\nS\nri Lanka\u2019s impressive social achievement in the midst of modest economic performance has\nmade it a subject of interest both nationally and internationally. Sri Lanka is a popular case\nstudy in the \u201cgrowth vs. welfare\u201d literature as well as in the subsequent \u201cadjustment with\na human face\u201d debate. Interest in the country did not wane even when it shifted policy in the\nlate 1970s from welfare orientation to growth orientation, but continued to address issues faced\nby disadvantaged sectors of society. When international interest thus turned to poverty alleviation\nin the 1980s, the Government of Sri Lanka already had decades of experience in addressing the\nissue at both a policy and implementation level.\nThe focus of this paper is on poverty-related data and corresponding measurements available\nin Sri Lanka, including estimates of poverty carried out using this data.1 The paper aims to provide\nan introduction into the monetary estimates of poverty in Sri Lanka and the data available to carry\nout these estimates. Some issues such as the methods of calculating the poverty line are discussed\nin greater depth than others, such as the human development indicators of poverty.\nIt must be highlighted that there has been a high level of dynamism among the institutions\ninvolved in poverty data and poverty measurement during the last few years. The Department of\nCensus and Statistics (DCS) and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), as the two major sources\nof data, have been in close dialog along with other related professionals in relation to improving\nthe database and addressing the gap left by the lack of an official poverty line. The DCS is tasked\nwith the responsibility of developing the official poverty line.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II provides a discussion of the\nkey data sets that are produced by various government agencies in Sri Lanka and provide pertinent\ninformation on not only poverty, but economic activity of the poor and nonpoor. Section III covers\npoverty-related issues, including measurement and poverty estimates. It also provides, in brief,\na poverty profile and discusses some of the causes of poverty. Section IV describes the nature\nof distribution in incomes and consumption expenditures as captured by household survey data.\nSection V concerns itself with nonincome indicators related to poverty. Finally, Section VI concludes.\n1 This paper was initially prepared as a background paper to inform the discussion at the Inception Workshop of Building\na Poverty Database (RETA 5917). While the paper has been updated from its initial form presented in July 2001, it\nmust be noted that the paper was finalized as the official poverty line and the related incidence of poverty was\nmade public by the Department of Census and Statistics in June 2004. This information has been included in Appendix 1.", "MONETARY POVERTY ESTIMATES IN SRI LANKA:  SELECTED ISSUES\nNERANJANA GUNETILLEKE AND DINUSHKA SENANAYAKE\nII. DATA SOURCES\nA. Department of Census and Statistics\nThe scientific collection of data was institutionalized in Sri Lanka in 1871 with the setting\nup of the Department of Census and Statistics to undertake development of a comprehensive database\nof aggregated and disaggregated quantitative information on socioeconomic dimensions of\nSri Lankan society.\nSince its inception, the DCS has carried out a vast range of scheduled and special surveys\n(see Table 1).\nTABLE 1\nSELECTED DATA SOURCES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CENSUS AND STATISTICS\nNAME OF PUBLICATION FIRST AVAILABLE LATEST AVAILABLE\nCensus of Population and Housing (CPH) 1871 2001\nAgricultural Census Survey 1940 2002\n(Preliminary Release No 3)\nStatistical Abstract 1949 2003\nStatistical Pocket Book 1966 2003\nSocio-Economic Survey 1969/70 Restructured as LFSES\nLabour Force and Socio Economic Survey (LFSES) 1980/81 1985/86\nRestructured as HIES and LFS\nAnnual Survey of Industries 1984 2001\nCensus of Public and Semi Government Sector Employment 1985 2002 (Preliminary)\nDemography and Health Survey 1986/87 2000\nHousehold Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) 1990 2002\nSri Lanka Labour Force Survey 1990 (1st quarter) 2003 (2nd quarter)\nFood Balance Sheet 1993 2002\nSource: Department of Census and Statistics, Sri Lanka.\nOf the above sources, the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) is the most widely\nused in the study of poverty in Sri Lanka. The HIES uses a random sample of approximately 20,000\nhouseholds, collecting comprehensive data on household income and expenditure, and less detailed\ninformation on demography, agriculture, employment, and related matters. Data is tabulated at\nboth the national and district levels.\nThe latest HIES was conducted in 2002. A special feature of the survey was its inclusion of\nthe northern and eastern provinces, which have been excluded from coverage since 1985 due to\nthe unstable political and security situation in those areas. The 2002 HIES aims to calculate a\nseparate poverty line for the north and east, in order to better capture the special nature of poverty\nin those regions. However, as there was a time lag between the completion of the data collection\nin the north and east as against the rest of the country, the poverty data for these provinces are\nnot yet available despite the publication of the Final Report of the HIES 2002 in May 2004.\n2 OCTOBER 2004", "SECTION II\nDATA SOURCES\nB. Central Bank of Sri Lanka\nIn addition to the DCS, the other agency involved in generating statistical data is the Central\nBank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), which is vested with the responsibility of monitoring the national economy.\nThe CBSL conducts the Consumer Finances and Socio-Economic Surveys (CFS), which obtain data\non demographic features, socioeconomic conditions, labor force, employment and unemployment,\nincome, expenditure, consumption, saving, investment, loans, etc. However, the data is tabulated\nonly at the national and zonal level2 and the small sample size (less than 10,000) does not make\nit conducive to further disaggregation.\nAs in the case of HIES data, CFS data collected every 5 years has been used when calculating\nnational poverty levels. The 2003/2004 is the latest CFS and the data is yet to be published. As\nthe HIES and the CFS were carried out in consecutive years, which resulted in 4-year gaps in the\navailability of poverty-related data in Sri Lanka, DCS and CBSL are currently working on an adjustment\nof data collection dates that would provide data within shorter intervals.\nC. Other Sources\nMost line ministries carry out data collection under the guidance of DCS, to meet their specific\nneeds. Data sets with wider application are produced by the following:\n(i) Ministry of Agriculture produces data on cost of production, farm gate prices for\ndifferent crops, types of crops cultivated, and their location; and conducts studies\nthrough its Socio-Economic Policy Division on different dimensions of agricultural\nhouseholds.\n(ii) Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medicine generates data on health care, health\neducation, nutrition, behavioral changes, and incidence of diseases, and publishes\nthese on a regular basis in its Annual Health Bulletin. In addition, it collects monthly\ninformation on birth weight of children, nutritional status of children under five,\nimmunization, etc., through its Public Health Midwives and network of Mother and\nChild Clinics.\n(iii) Ministry of Education collects data on school populations, dropout rates, teacher-\npupil ratios, and state expenditure per child by school category. In relation to tertiary\neducation, state expenditure per student by academic course, and related characteristics\nof students and students\u2019 households are collated by the University Grants Commission.\n2 The CBSL divided the 25 districts into four zones. Zone 1: Colombo (excluding households in the Colombo municipality),\nGampaha, Kalutara, Galle, and Matara. Zone 2: Hambantota, Moneragala, Ampara, Polonnaruwa, Anuradhapura, and\nPuttalam. Zone 3: Jaffna, Mannar, Vavuniya, Kilinochchi, Trincomalee, and Batticaloa. Zone 4: Kandy, Matale, Nuwara\nEliya, Badulla, Ratnapura, Kegalle, and Kurunegala. Zone 5: areas falling under the Colombo municipality.\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 58 3", "MONETARY POVERTY ESTIMATES IN SRI LANKA:  SELECTED ISSUES\nNERANJANA GUNETILLEKE AND DINUSHKA SENANAYAKE\n(iv) Provincial Councils collect regional data on labor force, agriculture, industries, transport,\nhealth, education, social services, etc. disaggregated by district and divisional\nsecretariat, which is consolidated by the provincial planning unit of each province.\nIII. MEASURING POVERTY\nUntil recently Sri Lanka did not have an official poverty line. As a result, over the last several\nyears, various individuals or groups of individuals working in their capacity as independent\nresearchers have made estimates of the poverty line, both at national and sectoral levels. For practical\npurposes, these estimates have acted as national estimates with various government and other\nagencies using them for policy and targeting of poverty interventions. More recently, DCS, the key\ndata source, has published its own poverty figures based on poverty lines calculated by Vidyaratne\nand Tilakaratne (2003) for 1995/96, using HIES 1995/96 data. However, the major change has\ncome with the HIES 2002 report, which has for the first time a special section that estimates the\nincidence of poverty at the national, sectoral, provincial, and district levels. Hence, unlike previous\nHIES where a headcount index was not available until a few years after the release of the survey\ndata, measures of the poverty incidence and the HIES 2002 were released simultaneously in 2003.\nA. Poverty Lines for Sri Lanka\nThe duality of the policy focus on poverty in Sri Lanka and the lack of an official poverty\nline until June 2004 have created a situation where multiple poverty lines have been calculated\nover the years, and generated substantial critical analysis (see for example, Alailima 1986; Hopkins\nand Jogaratnam 1990; Lakshman 1997, 1998; Tudawe 2000; Gunewardena 2004b).\nTable 2 highlights the various data sources as well as methodology used in calculating poverty\nlines during the last 30 years. Despite the variance and controversy in methodology and lack of\nofficial recognition, these estimates are used on an ad hoc basis by various government as well\nas nongovernment agencies to guide national poverty alleviation programs3 and strategize poverty-\ntargeted interventions.\n3 However, the governments\u2019 current poverty alleviation program \u201cSamurdhi\u201d, adopts its own measure of poverty to\nidentify beneficiaries. Households whose monthly income is less than Rs. 1500 are defined as poor.\n4 OCTOBER 2004", "SECTION III\nMEASURING POVERTY\nTABLE 2\nVARIOUS POVERTY LINES FOR SRI LANKA\nPOVERTY\nLINE/\nRELEVANT PERSON/\nYEAR MONTH BASE DATA SOURCE SOURCE\n1969/70 Rs. 21 Price adjusted food expenditure line LFSS 1970 Bhalla and Glewwe\ncomputed by Gunaratne (1985) (1986)\n1978/79 Rs. 70 Per capita monthly food expenditure CFS 1981/82 Gunaratne (1985)\nof the bottom 40% of the households\n1981/82 Rs. 106 Rs. 70 inflated by the self calculated CFS 1981/82 Gunaratne (1985)\nfood price index\n1985 Rs. 202 2,500 calories and 53 grams of HIES 1985/86 Nanayakkara and\nprotein per adult male equivalent.

Calculating Poverty Lines: Choice of Methods4\nSri Lankan researchers have predominantly favored the Cost of Basic Needs (CBN) method5\nin calculating poverty lines over both the Direct Calorie Intake (DCI) and the Food Energy Intake\n(FEI) methods.6\nAlthough the CBN method has been the favored method over its alternatives, it is not without\ndrawbacks. The selection of the food component could have a certain degree of arbitrariness, as\nthere exists a number of different combinations that would satisfy the minimum caloric requirements.\nIn Sri Lanka, CBN also poses the problem of deriving sectoral and regional poverty lines in the\nabsence of reliable cross sectional price data at the subnational level.\nMost of the poverty lines relevant to the last two decades are based on the derivations of\nNanayakkara and Premaratne (1987). For 1985, these authors set 2,500 calories and 53 grams\nof protein as the minimum requirement of an ordinary adult who is 20-39 years of age. They then\nestimated the cost of this food bundle, which they found to be Rs. 202 in 1985/86 prices.\nDatt and Gunewardena (1997) and Gunewardena (2000) provide comparable poverty measures\nover three HIES surveys. They took as their point of departure the estimates by Nanayakkara and\nPremaratne (1987). Taking the food bundle of Nanayakkara and Premaratne as given and adding\nto it a nonfood component, the reference poverty line for Sri Lanka in 1995/96 was estimated\nas Rs. 792 in the prices of that year. Gunewardena (2000) also estimates regional poverty lines\nby using spatial food price indices for 1995/96. The national and subnational poverty lines calculated\nby Gunewardena (2000) are shown in Table 3.\n4 Details on two poverty lines are provided in Appendix 1 and 2, respectively. Appendix 1 describes the newly announced\nofficial poverty line while Appendix 2 describes the poverty line used by Gunewardena (2000).\n5 The CBN method identifies a consumption bundle that is adequate for fulfilling one\u2019s basic needs and estimates the\ncost of that bundle. The bundle consists of two components, namely, a food component and a nonfood component.\nThe food component constitutes that quantity of food that satisfies the minimum nutritional requirement of an ordinary\nadult, while the nonfood component comprises shelter, clothing, transportation, and other items that are indispensable\nto an individual\u2019s or household\u2019s participation in community life.\n6 The DCI method calculates the minimum required daily calorie intake for an adult equivalent, and all households\nwhose caloric intake is less than the required intake are classified as poor. The FEI method translates the minimum\nrequired caloric intake per adult equivalent into monetary values. In the calculation of the food expenditure, a nonfood\ncomponent gets added automatically. All households whose expenditure is less than the calculated figure are classified\nas poor.\n6 OCTOBER 2004", "SECTION III\nMEASURING POVERTY\nTABLE 3\nPOVERTY LINES, 1995/96\n(RS./PERSON/MONTH AT CURRENT PRICES)\nREGION SECTOR FOOD POVERTY LINE GENERAL POVERTY LINE\nWestern Rural 641.22 803.56\nUrban 712.94 902.48\nCentral Rural 616.72 751.37\nUrban 619.97 772.44\nSouthern Rural 605.32 742.87\nUrban 663.05 853.67\nN.

Poverty Incidence\n1. Headcount Index\nThough there seems to be no agreement regarding the definition of poverty and poverty\nlines in Sri Lanka, there is broad consensus regarding the basic trend and nature of poverty. It\nis generally accepted that poverty levels show a falling trend with approximately 25 percent of\nthe population facing conditions of consumption poverty, as of the late 1990s. In terms of sectoral\nvariance, poverty has been consistently highest in the rural sector and lowest in the urban sector.\nWhile the estate sector has a lower incidence of consumption poverty than the rural sector, qualitative\nstudies have shown that the estate sector faces higher levels of human and social deprivation as\nestate populations have lower education achievements, less access to health care, greater housing\ndensity, etc.\nTABLE 5\nVARYING POVERTY LINES AND ESTIMATES OF POVERTY IN SRI LANKA\nINCIDENCE OF POVERTY\nSRI\nDATA SOURCE STUDY LANKA URBAN RURAL ESTATE POVERTY LINE\nLFSS (DCS 1970) Bhalla and 11.2 5.0 12.8 11.1 Per capita food expenditure\nGlewwe (1986) Rs. 70 per month at\n1978/79 prices\nCFS (CBSL 1973) Anand and 27.6 22.7 31.6 8.1 Per capita food expenditure\nHarris (1985) Rs. 70 per month at\n1978/79 prices\nCFS (CBSL 1983) Anand and 12.3 14.3 12.8 3.6 Per capita food expenditure\nHarris (1985) Rs. 60 per month at\n1978/79 prices\nCFS (CBSL 1983) Gunaratne 22.3 19.4 25.0 7.6 Per capita food expenditure\n(1985) Rs. 70 per month at\n1978/79 prices\nLFSS (DCS 1985/86) Korale (1987) 39.4 27.6 45.7 5.7 Average household income per\nmonth needed to meet minimum\nnutrition (2,200 cal) and basic\nneeds: Urban Rs. 1920,\nRural Rs. 1610, Estate Rs. 1451\nLFSS (DCS 1985/86) Datt and 27.33 16.43 31.67 14.31 Lower poverty line: Rs. 471.20\nGunewardena per person per month in 1990/91\n(1997) prices\n40.6 26.78 45.48 30.85 Higher poverty line: Rs. 565.44\nper person per month in 1990/91\nprices\n(continued next page)\n8 OCTOBER 2004", "SECTION III\nMEASURING POVERTY\nTABLE 5 (CONTINUED)\nINCIDENCE OF POVERTY\nSRI\nDATA SOURCE STUDY LANKA URBAN RURAL ESTATE POVERTY LINE\nHIES Datt and 22.36 18.31 24.41 12.62 Lower poverty line: Rs. 471.20\n(DCS 1990/91) Gunewardena per person per month in 1990/91\n(1997) prices\n35.34 28.43 38.05 27.51 Rs. 565.44 per person per month\nin 1990/91\nHIES Gunewardena 25.17 14.67 26.95 24.92 Adjusted food poverty line\n(DCS 1995/96) (2000) Rs. 791.67 per person per month\nLower poverty line\nHigher poverty 39.2 24.94 41.33 45.32 20% higher than the lower poverty\nline line.

Around 90 percent of the poor lived in the rural sector in 2002, in contrast to 5 percent\neach in the urban and estate sectors. In terms of trends, the declining trend in poverty is clearly\nevident in the urban as well as rural sectors while a mixed trend is observed in the estate sector,\nwith a rise in poverty from 1990/91 to 1995/96 and a decline in poverty over the next 5 years.\nVulnerability to fluctuations is highest in the rural sector, where a large share of the population\nis engaged in agriculture, which is subject to seasonality.\nRegional disparities in poverty in Sri Lanka are reflected by the large gaps between the districts\nwith the highest and lowest incidence of poverty. The regions that display high levels of poverty\nare also those with low access to publicly provided services and hence low achievements in human\ndevelopment indicators.\nWhile there are no formal quantitative calculations on the incidence of poverty in the North\nEast, the Poverty Reduction Framework (2000) estimated the incidence of poverty to range between\n25-55 percent. The lower limit was based on the preliminary findings of the World Bank\u2019s Integrated\nSurvey, which shows that poverty in the cleared areas of the North and East are similar to the national\nlevels of poverty (25 percent), and the upper limit assumes that poverty in those regions are as\nhigh as the poorest province (Uva Province) in the country (World Bank 2000).\nWhile the above estimates look purely at consumption poverty, it has been recognized that\npoverty in the North and East is of a different nature to the rest of country and should be measured\nin its multidimensional form. Loss of livelihoods, destruction of physical and social capital, forced\ndisplacement, uncertainty, trauma, and reliance on relief are some of the facets of poverty that\nare unique to this region.\nSarvananthan (2003) carries various socioeconomic data, which verify the fact that deprivation\nis greater in the strife-affected regions than in the rest of the country. Only 40 percent of households\nin the East and 22 percent of the households in the North have access to electricity, as against\nthe national rate of 56 percent. Households with access to a safe water supply in the North and\nEast are 20 percent, well below the national rate of 45 percent. While the above data indicates\nthe lack of economic infrastructure in the regions, indicators of health care and education show\nthat the region\u2019s social infrastructure faces a similar situation.\nWhile secondary data on education in the region is extremely limited one could assume a\nsignificant deterioration in education over the past two decades. Recruitment of child soldiers,\ndisplacement, constant disruptions to schooling due to fighting and hartals are some of the reasons\nfor the high school dropout rates; 15 percent as against 4 percent in the rest of the country.\nFurthermore, destruction of infrastructure and occupation of schools by armed forces throughout\nthe region also severely hampered education standards (UN 2003).\nLow birth weight in the North and East is 25.7 percent, home births are 19.4 percent, and\ninfant mortality10 is 14.7, while the national figures for the indicators are 16.7, 4.0, and 15.4\npercent, respectively. Although infant mortality in the North and East is slightly better than the\nnational rate, it should be emphasized that Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, and Mannar districts\n(in the Northern Province) fared much worse, with infant mortality rates ranging from 20.3 to 27.8.\n10Infant mortality is measured as the number of deaths per 1,000 live births.\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 58 11", "MONETARY POVERTY ESTIMATES IN SRI LANKA:  SELECTED ISSUES\nNERANJANA GUNETILLEKE AND DINUSHKA SENANAYAKE\nD. Characteristics of the Poor\nFrom the statistical information obtained from various sources, a typical characterization of\na poor household is one that is employed in low skill occupations, has diversified income sources,\nlacks ownership or access to productive assets, has only primary school level of education, could\nbelong to any ethnic group, and has a large average household size and a high dependency ratio.\nThis typical profile has not changed dramatically in the last three decades.\nHowever, there are certain groups that make it necessary to go beyond the basic\ncharacterization of a poor household. The elderly is one such group as Sri Lanka\u2019s high achievements\nin human development in life expectancy and low population increase has created a population\npyramid that resembles that of high income economies; a young generation at the base and a\nrapidly aging population at the top. The existence of a growing population of the elderly will make\nincreasing demands on the country\u2019s welfare program.\nNotwithstanding the high rates of consumption poverty in Sri Lanka, there is very little abject\npoverty\u2014in terms of starvation and destitution\u2014in the country. However, there are specific pockets\nwithin the population that do fall into this category, and are termed chronically poor. Displaced\nhouseholds, households in conflict areas, unemployed estate workers, households in isolated villages,\nand marginalized social groups fall into the category of chronically poor. Although the first three\ngroups have received considerable recognition in the policy arena in recent years, the latter two\nhave received little attention.\nE.  Causes of Poverty\nA range of factors have been identified in the literature as causes of poverty in Sri Lanka.\nThese causes, which have changed little over time, relate mainly to constraints in agriculture (weak\nmarketing structures, low productivity, imperfect property rights, small farm size, shortfalls in access\nto water especially in the nonirrigated areas of the dry zone); rural industry (limited access and\nutilization of technology, poor production and quality standards, high capital costs, raw material\nand product marketing bottlenecks); infrastructure (shortfalls in physical infrastructure such as\nenergy, communications, all weather roads); weak access to employment opportunities (youth\nunemployment, differential regional growth); and weak access to public services (lack of transport\nfacilities, low quality of education and health care provision).\nBut perhaps the most critical factor in the well-being of the Sri Lankan nation is the ongoing\nsecessionist conflict. It has a devastatingly impoverishing impact on the population of the North\nand East provinces and the villages bordering this region in the North Central and Uva provinces.\nThese communities face multiple disadvantages of physical vulnerability, destroyed means of\nlivelihood, and disruption in state provision of services and nonphysical aspects such as war trauma.\nThe impoverishing impact is also felt in the rest of the country as the government shifts budgetary\npriorities away from welfare and development to deal with the strife. Meanwhile, investment and\neconomic dynamism are adversely affected. Though the literature on the political and ethnic aspects\nof the conflict has been prolific, there is little that has been written on the impact of the conflict\non poverty in the country. This issue is now being increasingly focused upon as relevant data\nbecomes available and access to those regions is possible due to the ongoing ceasefire.\n12 OCTOBER 2004", "SECTION IV\nDISTRIBUTION\nIV. DISTRIBUTION\nA. Income Shares by Decile\nThe research interest in relative poverty in Sri Lanka closely reflects trends in the international\ndebate as well as the changing policy orientation of the country. Until the major policy changes\nin 1977, the policy orientation leaned heavily toward redistributive considerations and hence paid\nmuch attention to equity and welfare issues. Interest in income distribution and relative poverty\nwas very high. During the 1980s this interest waned and has now all but disappeared from the\neconomic debate. It is now rare that relative poverty is mentioned explicitly as the economic\ndevelopment plans are laid out. This is despite the fact that both the Department of Census and\nStatistics and the Central Bank regularly provide tabulations of income distribution (a proxy measure\nof relative poverty) in their respective publications.\nThe following tables give the latest statistics describing the distribution of income within\nthe population.\nTABLE 7\nINCOME RECEIVERS INCOME (AVERAGE MONTHLY) AND\nSHARE OF INCOME BY INCOME RECEIVERS INCOME DECILE, 2002\nDECILE (RS.)

However, looking only at the terminal\nyears of the data, one can say that the relative position of the poor has deteriorated in the last\nfour decades. The income of the poorest in the country fell from 18.9 percent of the income of\nthe richest in 1963 to 13.4 percent in 2002.\nB.

The Gini concentration\ncoefficient is shown on Table 10 for several selected years for the period 1963-2002.\nTABLE 10\nGINI COEFFICIENT OF CONCENTRATION FOR INCOME RECEIVERS\nSECTOR 1963 1973 78/79 81/82 86/87 90/91 95/96 2002\nUrban 0.49 0.40 0.51 0.54 0.53 0.58 0.53 0.55\nRural 0.44 0.37 0.49 0.49 0.50 0.53 0.52 0.51\nEstate 0.27 0.37 0.32 0.32 0.31 0.36 0.37 0.39\nSri Lanka 0.49 0.41 0.49 0.52 0.52 0.52 0.52 0.55\nSources: HIES (DCS various years); CFS (CBSL various years).\nThe coefficient suggests a clear improvement in distribution from 1963 to 1973, as it fell\nfrom 0.49 to 0.41 over the 10-year period. However, it worsened therefrom, as it rose to 0.49 in\n1978/79, to 0.52 over 1981/82-1995/96, and to 0.55 in 2002. It has been argued that the\nimprovement in the first decade of the data came in the wake of the pro-welfare focus of the national\npolicies up to 1977 and the deterioration thereafter as the aftermath of the policy restructuring\ntoward economic growth. However the debate goes, the causes underpinning the change in income\ndistribution remain to be unravelled.\nC.

NONINCOME INDICATORS\nA. Education\nData on education in Sri Lanka comes from the various sources of the Department of Census\nand Statistics. The Ministry of Education has a specialized database on students, teachers, and\nfacilities of schools, by category, in all the country\u2019s regions.\nThe importance of education as a fundamental right of citizens has long been recognized\nby the Government of Sri Lanka. The recognition is operationalized in the form of state provision\nof universal free education. It is a measure of the success of the government\u2019s educational program\nthat the current literacy rate for males is 94 percent and for females 91 percent. There is near\nuniversal enrolment at the primary level.\nThe relationship of this high level of achievement in the educational field with poverty\neradication is, however less clear. From the various studies that have been conducted looking into\nthe correlation between education levels and earning capacity, the general conclusion seems to\nbe that there is no positive correlation between primary education and income generation capacity.\nMost poor households are literate and have on average eight years of education. However, secondary\neducation and to a greater extent tertiary education have the potential to lift households out of\npoverty.\nThe current debate on education in Sri Lanka focuses on the quality of education. The data\non the performance of students at the three public examinations allows an analysis of quality to\na certain extent. However, such an examination is handicapped by data gaps on teaching methods,\ncurriculum, etc.\n16 OCTOBER 2004", "SECTION VI\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nB. Health and Nutrition\nHealth is a sector with one of the most varied databases. The data collected by the Department\nof Census and Statistics is complemented by Ministry of Health sources. Detailed data pertain to\ndisease and epidemiology and the primary health care system, and include such information as\ndoctor-patient ratios, hospitals per square area, beds per capita, etc. As in the case of education,\nthe current research is focused strongly on the quality of health care.\nNutrition poses a special problem in Sri Lanka. Malnutrition, especially among young children,\ncontinues to cast a very dark shadow on Sri Lanka\u2019s human development achievements. Over 38\npercent of the below five age group suffer from malnutrition. The disaggregated data on income\nshow that over 90 percent of the bottommost quintile of income earners obtain less than the\nrecommended calorie intake. Within this group the most serious problem lies with the urban sector\nhouseholds, and, in terms of occupational category, with agricultural workers. However, there is\na high rate of prevalence among the nonpoor as well. Approximately 10 percent of children under\nfive in the highest income quintile are malnourished.\nC. Employment\nUnemployment is an indicator of poverty as well as a key source of welfare. The data on\nemployment comes mainly from the Central Bank\u2019s Consumer Finances Survey, the Department of\nCensus and Statistics\u2019 Labour Force and Socio-Economic Surveys, and the subsequent Labour Force\nSurveys. The data is disaggregated by employment sectors, occupational type, region, gender, and\nage.\nEmployment generation is currently at the top of the government\u2019s agenda. There is particular\nconcern for youth employment, a matter spurred by the youth insurgencies of 1971 and 1989/\n90, which was said to have been the result of frustration among the educated youth over the failure\nof the economy to meet the students\u2019 higher aspirations. Attention is also being focused on such\nissues as mismatch,  \u201cwho gains, who loses\u201d in the sectoral growth process, the female bias of\npoststructural adjustment employment generation, the rise of child (10-14 age group) employment,\nchanges in the quality of employment (based on the level in the occupational ladder), and the\n\u201cinformalization\u201d\u2019 of the labor market.\nFor the immediate present, the focus of research is the restructuring of labor laws and wages.\nVI. CONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe combined portfolio of quantitative data available through the Department of Census and\nStatistics, Central Bank of Sri Lanka, and other line ministry sources is fairly comprehensive. However,\na major issue that arises is the comparability of the various data sets. The data sets collected by\nline ministries and departments are frequently supervised by DCS staff members but suffer from\ncomparability problems mainly in terms of time periods used, spatial units, and at times definitions\nof the indicators.\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 58 17", "MONETARY POVERTY ESTIMATES IN SRI LANKA:  SELECTED ISSUES\nNERANJANA GUNETILLEKE AND DINUSHKA SENANAYAKE\nOn poverty issues, though the debate has a long history, gaps exist and questions regarding\nthe poverty line remained unsolved.

It\nis computed as a \u201cLaspeyeres\u201d index using implicit prices of food items for the reference group, which\nconsists of the 2nd-4th deciles.\n20 OCTOBER 2004", "APPENDIX\nAPPENDIX TABLE 1\nNOMINAL POVERTY LINES BY DISTRICT\nDISTRICT 1990/91 1995/96 2002\nNational 475 833 1423\nColombo 518 908 1537\nGanpaha 489 875 1508\nKalutara 494 866 1523\nKandy 485 850 1451\nMatale 466 816 1395\nNuwara Eliya 494 841 1437\nGalle 489 833 1466\nMatara 470 816 1395\nHambantota 470 791 1338\nKurunegala 456 791 1352\nPuttalam 461 841 1423\nAnuradhapura 456 816 1380\nPolonnaruwa 475 783 1366\nBadulla 485 850 1409\nMoneragala 480 701 1366\nRathnapura 494 833 1451\nKegalle 466 858 1437\nSource: Department of Census and Statistics (2004).\nThe district poverty lines adjust for \u201ccost of living\u201d differences among the various districts.
