While\nthese poverty measures have provided a good base for poverty analysis, the paper\nalso  touches  on  the  problems  generated  by  the  use  of  multiple  methods.  The\nrelease of the official poverty line by the Department of Census and Statistics\ncan be seen as a major step forward in the debate on poverty measurement in\nSri  Lanka.\n\n\fI. INTRODUCTION\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s impressive social achievement in the midst of modest economic performance has\n\nmade it a subject of interest both nationally and internationally. Sri Lanka is a popular case\nstudy  in  the  \u201cgrowth  vs.  welfare\u201d  literature  as  well  as  in  the  subsequent  \u201cadjustment  with\na  human  face\u201d  debate.  Interest  in  the  country  did  not  wane  even  when  it  shifted  policy  in  the\nlate 1970s from welfare orientation to growth orientation, but continued to address issues faced\nby disadvantaged sectors of society. When international interest thus turned to poverty alleviation\nin the 1980s, the Government of Sri Lanka already had decades of experience in addressing the\nissue  at  both  a  policy  and  implementation  level.\n\nThe focus of this paper is on poverty-related data and corresponding measurements available\nin Sri Lanka, including estimates of poverty carried out using this data.1 The paper aims to provide\nan introduction into the monetary estimates of poverty in Sri Lanka and the data available to carry\nout these estimates. Some issues such as the methods of calculating the poverty line are discussed\nin  greater  depth  than  others,  such  as  the  human  development  indicators  of  poverty.\n\nIt must be highlighted that there has been a high level of dynamism among the institutions\ninvolved in poverty data and poverty measurement during the last few years. The Department of\nCensus and Statistics (DCS) and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), as the two major sources\nof data, have been in close dialog along with other related professionals in relation to improving\nthe database and addressing the gap left by the lack of an official poverty line. The DCS is tasked\nwith  the  responsibility  of  developing  the  official  poverty  line.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II provides a discussion of the\nkey data sets that are produced by various government agencies in Sri Lanka and provide pertinent\ninformation on not only poverty, but economic activity of the poor and nonpoor. Section III covers\npoverty-related issues, including measurement and poverty estimates. It also provides, in brief,\na  poverty  profile  and  discusses  some  of  the  causes  of  poverty.  Section  IV  describes  the  nature\nof distribution in incomes and consumption expenditures as captured by household survey data.\nSection V concerns itself with nonincome indicators related to poverty. Finally, Section VI concludes.\n\n1 This paper was initially prepared as a background paper to inform the discussion at the Inception Workshop of Building\na Poverty Database (RETA 5917). While the paper has been updated from its initial form presented in July 2001, it\nmust  be  noted  that  the  paper  was  finalized  as  the  official  poverty  line  and  the  related  incidence  of  poverty  was\nmade public by the Department of Census and Statistics in June 2004. This information has been included in Appendix 1.\n\n\fMONETARY POVERTY ESTIMATES IN SRI LANKA:  SELECTED ISSUES\nNERANJANA GUNETILLEKE AND DINUSHKA SENANAYAKE\n\nII. DATA SOURCES\n\nA.\n\nDepartment of Census and Statistics\n\nThe scientific collection of data was institutionalized in Sri Lanka in 1871 with the setting\nup of the Department of Census and Statistics to undertake development of a comprehensive database\nof  aggregated  and  disaggregated  quantitative  information  on  socioeconomic  dimensions  of\nSri Lankan  society.\n\nSince its inception, the DCS has carried out a vast range of scheduled and special surveys\n\n(see  Table  1).\n\nTABLE 1\nSELECTED DATA SOURCES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CENSUS AND STATISTICS\n\nNAME OF PUBLICATION\n\nFIRST AVAILABLE\n\nLATEST AVAILABLE\n\nCensus of Population  and Housing (CPH)\n\nAgricultural  Census  Survey\n\nStatistical  Abstract\n\nStatistical Pocket Book\n\nSocio-Economic Survey\n\nLabour  Force  and  Socio  Economic  Survey  (LFSES)\n\nAnnual  Survey  of  Industries\n\nDemography  and  Health  Survey\n\nHousehold  Income  and  Expenditure  Survey  (HIES)\n\nSri  Lanka  Labour  Force  Survey\n\nFood  Balance  Sheet\n\nSource:  Department  of  Census  and  Statistics,  Sri  Lanka.\n\n1871\n\n1940\n\n1949\n\n1966\n\n1969/70\n\n1980/81\n\n1984\n\n1985\n\n1986/87\n\n2002\n(Preliminary  Release  No  3)\n\nRestructured  as  LFSES\n\n1985/86\nRestructured  as  HIES  and  LFS\n\n2001\n\n2003\n\n2003\n\n2001\n\n2000\n\n1990\n1990  (1st  quarter) 2003  (2nd  quarter)\n\n2002\n\n1993\n\n2002\n\nCensus  of  Public  and  Semi  Government  Sector  Employment\n\n2002 (Preliminary)\n\nOf the above sources, the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) is the most widely\nused in the study of poverty in Sri Lanka. The HIES uses a random sample of approximately 20,000\nhouseholds, collecting comprehensive data on household income and expenditure, and less detailed\ninformation  on  demography,  agriculture,  employment,  and  related  matters.  Data  is  tabulated  at\nboth  the  national  and  district  levels.\n\nThe latest HIES was conducted in 2002. A special feature of the survey was its inclusion of\nthe northern and eastern provinces, which have been excluded from coverage since 1985 due to\nthe  unstable  political  and  security  situation  in  those  areas.  The  2002  HIES  aims  to  calculate  a\nseparate poverty line for the north and east, in order to better capture the special nature of poverty\nin those regions. However, as there was a time lag between the completion of the data collection\nin the north and east as against the rest of the country, the poverty data for these provinces are\nnot  yet  available  despite  the  publication  of  the  Final  Report  of  the  HIES  2002  in  May  2004.\n\n2\n\nOCTOBER 2004\n\n\fSECTION II\nDATA SOURCES\n\nB.\n\nCentral Bank of Sri Lanka\n\nIn addition to the DCS, the other agency involved in generating statistical data is the Central\nBank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), which is vested with the responsibility of monitoring the national economy.\nThe CBSL conducts the Consumer Finances and Socio-Economic Surveys (CFS), which obtain data\non demographic features, socioeconomic conditions, labor force, employment and unemployment,\nincome, expenditure, consumption, saving, investment, loans, etc. However, the data is tabulated\nonly at the national and zonal level2  and the small sample size (less than 10,000) does not make\nit  conducive  to  further  disaggregation.\n\nAs in the case of HIES data, CFS data collected every 5 years has been used when calculating\nnational poverty levels. The 2003/2004 is the latest CFS and the data is yet to be published. As\nthe HIES and the CFS were carried out in consecutive years, which resulted in 4-year gaps in the\navailability of poverty-related data in Sri Lanka, DCS and CBSL are currently working on an adjustment\nof  data  collection  dates  that  would  provide  data  within  shorter  intervals.\n\nC.\n\nOther Sources\n\nMost line ministries carry out data collection under the guidance of DCS, to meet their specific\n\nneeds.  Data  sets  with  wider  application  are  produced  by  the  following:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\nMinistry  of  Agriculture  produces  data  on  cost  of  production,  farm  gate  prices  for\ndifferent crops, types of crops cultivated, and their location; and conducts studies\nthrough  its  Socio-Economic  Policy  Division  on  different  dimensions  of  agricultural\nhouseholds.\n\nMinistry  of  Health  and  Indigenous  Medicine  generates  data  on  health  care,  health\neducation,  nutrition,  behavioral  changes,  and  incidence  of  diseases,  and  publishes\nthese on a regular basis in its Annual Health Bulletin. In addition, it collects monthly\ninformation  on  birth  weight  of  children,  nutritional  status  of  children  under  five,\nimmunization, etc., through its Public Health Midwives and network of Mother and\nChild  Clinics.\n\nMinistry  of  Education  collects  data  on  school  populations,  dropout  rates,  teacher-\npupil ratios, and state expenditure per child by school category. In relation to tertiary\neducation, state expenditure per student by academic course, and related characteristics\nof students and students\u2019 households are collated by the University Grants Commission.\n\n2 The CBSL divided the 25 districts into four zones. Zone 1: Colombo (excluding households in the Colombo municipality),\nGampaha, Kalutara, Galle, and Matara. Zone 2: Hambantota, Moneragala, Ampara, Polonnaruwa, Anuradhapura, and\nPuttalam. Zone 3: Jaffna, Mannar, Vavuniya, Kilinochchi, Trincomalee, and Batticaloa. Zone 4: Kandy, Matale, Nuwara\nEliya,  Badulla,  Ratnapura,  Kegalle,  and  Kurunegala.  Zone  5:  areas  falling  under  the  Colombo  municipality.\n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 58\n\n3\n\n\fMONETARY POVERTY ESTIMATES IN SRI LANKA:  SELECTED ISSUES\nNERANJANA GUNETILLEKE AND DINUSHKA SENANAYAKE\n\n(iv)\n\nProvincial Councils collect regional data on labor force, agriculture, industries, transport,\nhealth,  education,  social  services,  etc.  disaggregated  by  district  and  divisional\nsecretariat, which is consolidated by the provincial planning unit of each province.\n\nIII. MEASURING POVERTY\n\nUntil recently Sri Lanka did not have an official poverty line. As a result, over the last several\nyears,  various  individuals  or  groups  of  individuals  working  in  their  capacity  as  independent\nresearchers have made estimates of the poverty line, both at national and sectoral levels. For practical\npurposes,  these  estimates  have  acted  as  national  estimates  with  various  government  and  other\nagencies using them for policy and targeting of poverty interventions. More recently, DCS, the key\ndata source, has published its own poverty figures based on poverty lines calculated by Vidyaratne\nand  Tilakaratne  (2003)  for  1995/96,  using  HIES  1995/96  data.  However,  the  major  change  has\ncome with the HIES 2002 report, which has for the first time a special section that estimates the\nincidence of poverty at the national, sectoral, provincial, and district levels. Hence, unlike previous\nHIES where a headcount index was not available until a few years after the release of the survey\ndata, measures of the poverty incidence and the HIES 2002 were released simultaneously in 2003.\n\nA.\n\nPoverty  Lines  for  Sri  Lanka\n\nThe duality of the policy focus on poverty in Sri Lanka and the lack of an official poverty\nline until June 2004 have created a situation where multiple poverty lines have been calculated\nover the years, and generated substantial critical analysis (see for example, Alailima 1986; Hopkins\nand  Jogaratnam  1990;  Lakshman  1997,  1998;  Tudawe  2000;  Gunewardena  2004b).\n\nTable 2 highlights the various data sources as well as methodology used in calculating poverty\nlines during the last 30 years. Despite the variance and controversy in methodology and lack of\nofficial recognition, these estimates are used on an ad hoc basis by various government as well\nas nongovernment agencies to guide national poverty alleviation programs3 and strategize poverty-\ntargeted  interventions.\n\n3 However,  the  governments\u2019  current  poverty  alleviation  program  \u201cSamurdhi\u201d,  adopts  its  own  measure  of  poverty  to\n\nidentify  beneficiaries.  Households  whose  monthly  income  is  less  than  Rs.  1500  are  defined  as  poor.\n\n4\n\nOCTOBER 2004\n\n\fSECTION III\nMEASURING POVERTY\n\nTABLE 2\nVARIOUS POVERTY LINES  FOR SRI LANKA\n\nPOVERTY\nLINE/\nPERSON/\nMONTH\n\nRELEVANT\nYEAR\n\n1969/70\n\nRs.  21\n\n1978/79\n\nRs.  70\n\n1981/82\n\nRs.  106\n\n1990/91\n\n1995/96\n\nLower:\nRs.  471\n\nHigher:\nRs.  565\n\nLower:\nRs.  791\n\n1995/96\n\nRs.  953\n\n1996/97\n\n2002\n\nLower:\nRs..  860\n\nHigher:\nRs..  1032\n\nRs.  1294\n\nBASE\n\nDATA SOURCE\n\nSOURCE\n\nPrice  adjusted  food  expenditure  line\ncomputed by Gunaratne (1985)\n\nLFSS  1970\n\nBhalla  and  Glewwe\n(1986)\n\nPer  capita  monthly  food  expenditure\nof  the  bottom  40%  of  the  households\n\nRs.  70  inflated  by  the  self  calculated\nfood price index\n\nCFS  1981/82\n\nGunaratne (1985)\n\nCFS  1981/82\n\nGunaratne (1985)\n\n1985\n\nRs.  202\n\n2,500  calories  and  53  grams  of\nprotein  per  adult  male  equivalent.\n\nHIES 1985/86\n\nNanayakkara  and\nPremaratne  (1987)\n\nCost  of  Basic  Needs,  i.e.,  food  (anchored\non  Nanayakkara  and  Premaratne\u2019s  food\npoverty line) and nonfood consumption\n\nHIES 1990/91\n\nDatt  and  Gunewardena\n(1997)\n\n20%  higher  than  the  lower  poverty\nline\n\nCost  of  Basic  Needs,  i.e.,  food\n(anchored  on  Nanayakkara  and\nPremaratne\u2019s  food  poverty  line)\nand nonfood consumption\n\nHigher:\nRs.  950\n\n20%  higher  than  the  lower  poverty\nline\n\nHIES 1995/96\n\nGunewardena (2000)\n\nCost  of  Basic  Needs,  i.e.,  food  (food\npoverty  line  calculated  on  the  food  basket\nof  the  2nd\u20134th  deciles)  and  nonfood\nconsumption\n\nHIES\n1995/96\n\nVidyaratne  and\nTilakaratne (2003)\n\nThe  poverty  line  of  1995/96  adjusted\nto  current    price\n\nCFS  1996/\n1997\n\nPradhan (1999)\n\n20%  higher  than  the  lower\npoverty line\n\nThe  Minimum  Required  Adult  Equivalent\nFood  Expenditure  is  used  as  the\nnational poverty line and is calculated for\nhouseholds  whose  (i)  in  the  lowest  income\nquartile,  (ii)  food  expenditure  is  over\n50% of total expenditure, and (iii) whose\ndaily  caloric  intake  is  between  2475-2750\n\nHIES  2002\n\nReport  on  HIES\n(DCS  2003)\n\n1990-2002\n\nSee  Appendix  1\n\nHIES  relevant\nyears\n\nDCS  (2004)\n\nSources:  Derived  from  Lakshman  (1998),  Tudawe  (2000),  and  sources  as  cited.\n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 58\n\n5\n\n\fMONETARY POVERTY ESTIMATES IN SRI LANKA:  SELECTED ISSUES\nNERANJANA GUNETILLEKE AND DINUSHKA SENANAYAKE\n\nB.\n\nCalculating Poverty Lines: Choice of Methods4\n\nSri Lankan researchers have predominantly favored the Cost of Basic Needs (CBN) method5\nin calculating poverty lines over both the Direct Calorie Intake (DCI) and the Food Energy Intake\n(FEI)  methods.6\n\nAlthough the CBN method has been the favored method over its alternatives, it is not without\ndrawbacks. The selection of the food component could have a certain degree of arbitrariness, as\nthere exists a number of different combinations that would satisfy the minimum caloric requirements.\nIn Sri Lanka, CBN also poses the problem of deriving sectoral and regional poverty lines in the\nabsence  of  reliable  cross  sectional  price  data  at  the  subnational  level.\n\nMost of the poverty lines relevant to the last two decades are based on the derivations of\nNanayakkara  and  Premaratne  (1987).  For  1985,  these  authors  set  2,500  calories  and  53  grams\nof protein as the minimum requirement of an ordinary adult who is 20-39 years of age. They then\nestimated  the  cost  of  this  food  bundle,  which  they  found  to  be  Rs.  202  in  1985/86  prices.\n\nDatt and Gunewardena (1997) and Gunewardena (2000) provide comparable poverty measures\nover three HIES surveys. They took as their point of departure the estimates by Nanayakkara and\nPremaratne (1987). Taking the food bundle of Nanayakkara and Premaratne as given and adding\nto  it  a  nonfood  component,  the  reference  poverty  line  for  Sri  Lanka  in  1995/96  was  estimated\nas  Rs.  792  in  the  prices  of  that  year.  Gunewardena  (2000)  also  estimates  regional  poverty  lines\nby using spatial food price indices for 1995/96. The national and subnational poverty lines calculated\nby  Gunewardena  (2000)  are  shown  in  Table  3.\n\n4 Details on two poverty lines are provided in Appendix 1 and 2, respectively. Appendix 1 describes the newly announced\n\nofficial  poverty  line  while  Appendix  2  describes  the  poverty  line  used  by  Gunewardena  (2000).\n\n5 The CBN method identifies a consumption bundle that is adequate for fulfilling one\u2019s basic needs and estimates the\ncost of that bundle. The bundle consists of two components, namely, a food component and a nonfood component.\nThe food component constitutes that quantity of food that satisfies the minimum nutritional requirement of an ordinary\nadult, while the nonfood component comprises shelter, clothing, transportation, and other items that are indispensable\nto an individual\u2019s or household\u2019s participation in community life.\n\n6 The  DCI  method  calculates  the  minimum  required  daily  calorie  intake  for  an  adult  equivalent,  and  all  households\nwhose caloric intake is less than the required intake are classified as poor. The FEI method translates the minimum\nrequired caloric intake per adult equivalent into monetary values. In the calculation of the food expenditure, a nonfood\ncomponent gets added automatically. All households whose expenditure is less than the calculated figure are classified\nas  poor.\n\n6\n\nOCTOBER 2004\n\n\fSECTION III\nMEASURING POVERTY\n\nTABLE 3\nPOVERTY LINES, 1995/96\n(RS./PERSON/MONTH  AT CURRENT PRICES)\n\nSECTOR\n\nFOOD POVERTY LINE\n\nGENERAL  POVERTY  LINE\n\nREGION\n\nWestern\n\nCentral\n\nSouthern\n\nN.

It\nis generally accepted that poverty levels show a falling trend with approximately 25 percent of\nthe population facing conditions of consumption poverty, as of the late 1990s. In terms of sectoral\nvariance, poverty has been consistently highest in the rural sector and lowest in the urban sector.\nWhile the estate sector has a lower incidence of consumption poverty than the rural sector, qualitative\nstudies have shown that the estate sector faces higher levels of human and social deprivation as\nestate populations have lower education achievements, less access to health care, greater housing\ndensity,  etc.\n\nTABLE 5\nVARYING POVERTY LINES AND ESTIMATES OF POVERTY IN SRI LANKA\n\nDATA SOURCE\n\nSTUDY\n\nURBAN RURAL ESTATE\n\nPOVERTY LINE\n\nINCIDENCE  OF  POVERTY\n\nSRI\nLANKA\n\nLFSS  (DCS  1970)\n\n11.2\n\n5.0\n\n12.8\n\n11.1\n\nBhalla  and\nGlewwe  (1986)\n\nCFS  (CBSL  1973)\n\n27.6\n\n22.7\n\n31.6\n\n8.1\n\nAnand  and\nHarris (1985)\n\nAnand  and\nHarris (1985)\n\nGunaratne\n(1985)\n\nGunewardena\n(1997)\n\nCFS  (CBSL  1983)\n\n12.3\n\n14.3\n\n12.8\n\n3.6\n\nCFS  (CBSL  1983)\n\n22.3\n\n19.4\n\n25.0\n\n7.6\n\nLFSS (DCS 1985/86) Korale (1987)\n\n39.4\n\n27.6\n\n45.7\n\n5.7\n\nLFSS (DCS 1985/86) Datt  and\n\n27.33\n\n16.43\n\n31.67\n\n14.31\n\n40.6\n\n26.78\n\n45.48\n\n30.85\n\nPer  capita  food  expenditure\nRs.  70  per  month  at\n1978/79 prices\n\nPer  capita  food  expenditure\nRs.  70  per  month  at\n1978/79 prices\n\nPer  capita  food  expenditure\nRs.  60  per  month  at\n1978/79 prices\n\nPer  capita  food  expenditure\nRs.  70  per  month  at\n1978/79 prices\n\nAverage  household  income  per\nmonth  needed  to  meet  minimum\nnutrition (2,200 cal) and basic\nneeds:  Urban  Rs.  1920,\nRural  Rs.  1610,  Estate  Rs.  1451\n\nLower  poverty  line:  Rs.  471.20\nper  person  per  month  in  1990/91\nprices\n\nHigher  poverty  line:  Rs.  565.44\nper  person  per  month  in  1990/91\nprices\n\n(continued  next  page)\n\n8\n\nOCTOBER 2004\n\n\fSECTION III\nMEASURING POVERTY\n\nDATA SOURCE\n\nSTUDY\n\nURBAN RURAL\n\nESTATE POVERTY  LINE\n\nINCIDENCE  OF  POVERTY\n\nSRI\nLANKA\n\n22.36\n\n18.31\n\n24.41\n\n12.62\n\n35.34\n\n28.43\n\n38.05\n\n27.51\n\n25.17\n\n14.67\n\n26.95\n\n24.92\n\nLower  poverty  line:  Rs.  471.20\nper  person  per  month  in  1990/91\nprices\n\nRs.  565.44  per  person  per  month\nin 1990/91\n\nAdjusted  food  poverty  line\nRs.  791.67  per  person  per  month\n\n39.2\n\n24.94\n\n41.33\n\n45.32\n\n20%  higher  than  the  lower  poverty\nline.

As previously mentioned, the Final Report of the HIES 2002 does\nnot include estimates of poverty for the North East. However, the DCS is in the process of estimating\nsuch figures and the release of such data is anticipated in the very near future. By 2002, the poverty\nincidence among households at the national level was down to 23.9 percent, from 26.7 percent\nin  1995/96  and  30.4  percent  in  1990/91.\n\n8 The  incidence  of  poverty  for  the  three  sectors  is  based  on  the  food  poverty  lines,  not  the  total  poverty  line.\n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 58\n\n9\n\n\fMONETARY POVERTY ESTIMATES IN SRI LANKA:  SELECTED ISSUES\nNERANJANA GUNETILLEKE AND DINUSHKA SENANAYAKE\n\nAt the provincial level, the same improvement in the poverty situation can be seen.

The  poverty  line  is  calculated  as\n\nRs.  1338.48  per  adult  equivalent  per  month\n\n10\n\nOCTOBER 2004\n\n\fSECTION III\nMEASURING POVERTY\n\nThe sectoral analysis shows that poverty has remained a mainly rural phenomenon over the\ndecades. Around 90 percent of the poor lived in the rural sector in 2002, in contrast to 5 percent\neach in the urban and estate sectors. In terms of trends, the declining trend in poverty is clearly\nevident in the urban as well as rural sectors while a mixed trend is observed in the estate sector,\nwith a rise in poverty from 1990/91 to 1995/96 and a decline in poverty over the next 5 years.\nVulnerability to fluctuations is highest in the rural sector, where a large share of the population\nis  engaged  in  agriculture,  which  is  subject  to  seasonality.\n\nRegional disparities in poverty in Sri Lanka are reflected by the large gaps between the districts\nwith the highest and lowest incidence of poverty. The regions that display high levels of poverty\nare also those with low access to publicly provided services and hence low achievements in human\ndevelopment  indicators.\n\nWhile there are no formal quantitative calculations on the incidence of poverty in the North\nEast, the Poverty Reduction Framework (2000) estimated the incidence of poverty to range between\n25-55 percent. The lower limit was based on the preliminary findings of the World Bank\u2019s Integrated\nSurvey, which shows that poverty in the cleared areas of the North and East are similar to the national\nlevels of poverty (25 percent), and the upper limit assumes that poverty in those regions are as\nhigh  as  the  poorest  province  (Uva  Province)  in  the  country  (World  Bank  2000).\n\nWhile the above estimates look purely at consumption poverty, it has been recognized that\npoverty in the North and East is of a different nature to the rest of country and should be measured\nin its multidimensional form. Loss of livelihoods, destruction of physical and social capital, forced\ndisplacement, uncertainty, trauma, and reliance on relief are some of the facets of poverty that\nare  unique  to  this  region.\n\nSarvananthan (2003) carries various socioeconomic data, which verify the fact that deprivation\nis greater in the strife-affected regions than in the rest of the country. Only 40 percent of households\nin the East and 22 percent of the households in the North have access to electricity, as against\nthe national rate of 56 percent. Households with access to a safe water supply in the North and\nEast are 20 percent, well below the national rate of 45 percent. While the above data indicates\nthe lack of economic infrastructure in the regions, indicators of health care and education show\nthat  the  region\u2019s  social  infrastructure  faces  a  similar  situation.\n\nWhile  secondary  data  on  education  in  the  region  is  extremely  limited  one  could  assume  a\nsignificant deterioration in education over the past two decades. Recruitment of child soldiers,\ndisplacement, constant disruptions to schooling due to fighting and hartals are some of the reasons\nfor  the  high  school  dropout  rates;  15  percent  as  against  4  percent  in  the  rest  of  the  country.\nFurthermore, destruction of infrastructure and occupation of schools by armed forces throughout\nthe  region  also  severely  hampered  education  standards  (UN  2003).\n\nLow birth weight in the North and East is 25.7 percent, home births are 19.4 percent, and\ninfant  mortality10  is 14.7, while the national figures for the indicators are 16.7, 4.0, and 15.4\npercent, respectively. Although infant mortality in the North and East is slightly better than the\nnational rate, it should be emphasized that Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, and Mannar districts\n(in the Northern Province) fared much worse, with infant mortality rates ranging from 20.3 to 27.8.\n\n10 Infant  mortality  is  measured  as  the  number  of  deaths  per  1,000  live  births.\n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 58\n\n11\n\n\fMONETARY POVERTY ESTIMATES IN SRI LANKA:  SELECTED ISSUES\nNERANJANA GUNETILLEKE AND DINUSHKA SENANAYAKE\n\nD.\n\nCharacteristics  of  the  Poor\n\nFrom the statistical information obtained from various sources, a typical characterization of\na poor household is one that is employed in low skill occupations, has diversified income sources,\nlacks ownership or access to productive assets, has only primary school level of education, could\nbelong to any ethnic group, and has a large average household size and a high dependency ratio.\nThis  typical  profile  has  not  changed  dramatically  in  the  last  three  decades.\n\nHowever,  there  are  certain  groups  that  make  it  necessary  to  go  beyond  the  basic\ncharacterization of a poor household. The elderly is one such group as Sri Lanka\u2019s high achievements\nin human development in life expectancy and low population increase has created a population\npyramid  that  resembles  that  of  high  income  economies;  a  young  generation  at  the  base  and  a\nrapidly aging population at the top. The existence of a growing population of the elderly will make\nincreasing  demands  on  the  country\u2019s  welfare  program.\n\nNotwithstanding the high rates of consumption poverty in Sri Lanka, there is very little abject\npoverty\u2014in terms of starvation and destitution\u2014in the country. However, there are specific pockets\nwithin the population that do fall into this category, and are termed chronically poor. Displaced\nhouseholds, households in conflict areas, unemployed estate workers, households in isolated villages,\nand marginalized social groups fall into the category of chronically poor. Although the first three\ngroups have received considerable recognition in the policy arena in recent years, the latter two\nhave received little attention.\n\nE.\n\n Causes of Poverty\n\nA range of factors have been identified in the literature as causes of poverty in Sri Lanka.\nThese causes, which have changed little over time, relate mainly to constraints in agriculture (weak\nmarketing structures, low productivity, imperfect property rights, small farm size, shortfalls in access\nto water especially in the nonirrigated areas of the dry zone); rural industry (limited access and\nutilization of technology, poor production and quality standards, high capital costs, raw material\nand  product  marketing  bottlenecks);  infrastructure  (shortfalls  in  physical  infrastructure  such  as\nenergy,  communications,  all  weather  roads);  weak  access  to  employment  opportunities  (youth\nunemployment, differential regional growth); and weak access to public services (lack of transport\nfacilities,  low  quality  of  education  and  health  care  provision).\n\nBut perhaps the most critical factor in the well-being of the Sri Lankan nation is the ongoing\nsecessionist conflict. It has a devastatingly impoverishing impact on the population of the North\nand East provinces and the villages bordering this region in the North Central and Uva provinces.\nThese  communities  face  multiple  disadvantages  of  physical  vulnerability,  destroyed  means  of\nlivelihood, and disruption in state provision of services and nonphysical aspects such as war trauma.\nThe impoverishing impact is also felt in the rest of the country as the government shifts budgetary\npriorities away from welfare and development to deal with the strife. Meanwhile, investment and\neconomic dynamism are adversely affected. Though the literature on the political and ethnic aspects\nof the conflict has been prolific, there is little that has been written on the impact of the conflict\non  poverty  in  the  country.  This  issue  is  now  being  increasingly  focused  upon  as  relevant  data\nbecomes  available  and  access  to  those  regions  is  possible  due  to  the  ongoing  ceasefire.\n\n12\n\nOCTOBER 2004\n\n\fSECTION IV\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nA.\n\nIncome Shares by Decile\n\nIV. DISTRIBUTION\n\nThe research interest in relative poverty in Sri Lanka closely reflects trends in the international\ndebate as well as the changing policy orientation of the country. Until the major policy changes\nin 1977, the policy orientation leaned heavily toward redistributive considerations and hence paid\nmuch attention to equity and welfare issues. Interest in income distribution and relative poverty\nwas very high. During the 1980s this interest waned and has now all but disappeared from the\neconomic  debate.  It  is  now  rare  that  relative  poverty  is  mentioned  explicitly  as  the  economic\ndevelopment plans are laid out. This is despite the fact that both the Department of Census and\nStatistics and the Central Bank regularly provide tabulations of income distribution (a proxy measure\nof  relative  poverty)  in  their  respective  publications.\n\nThe following tables give the latest statistics describing the distribution of income within\n\nthe  population.\n\nTABLE 7\nINCOME RECEIVERS INCOME (AVERAGE MONTHLY) AND\nSHARE OF INCOME BY INCOME RECEIVERS INCOME DECILE, 2002\n\nMEAN INCOME\n\nPERCENT\n\nDECILE (RS.)\n\nAll  Deciles\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nLess  that  801\n\n801-1800\n\n1801-2683\n\n2684-3514\n\n3515- 4539\n\n4540-5617\n\n5618-7000\n\n7001-9000\n\n9001-13200\n\n10\n\nMore  than  13200\n\nSource:  Preliminary  Report  HIES  2002  (DCS  2002).\n\n7079\n\n395\n\n1292\n\n2255\n\n3102\n\n4021\n\n5080\n\n6318\n\n7967\n\n10835\n\n29857\n\n100\n\n0.6\n\n1.8\n\n3.2\n\n4.4\n\n5.7\n\n7.2\n\n9.3\n\n11.2\n\n14.9\n\n41.8\n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 58\n\n13\n\n\fMONETARY POVERTY ESTIMATES IN SRI LANKA:  SELECTED ISSUES\nNERANJANA GUNETILLEKE AND DINUSHKA SENANAYAKE\n\nTABLE 8\nPER CAPITA INCOME PER MONTH BY INCOME DECILES, 2002\n\nHOUSEHOLD  INCOME  DECILE  (RS.)\n\nPER CAPITA INCOME (RS.)\n\nPERCENT  OF  SHARE\n\nAll  deciles\n\nLess  than  3301\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n3301-4660\n\n4661-5823\n\n5824-7000\n\n7001-8387\n\n8388-10000\n\n10001-12688\n\n12689-16390\n\n16391-24225\n\n10\n\n24226  and  above\n\nSource:  Preliminary  Report  HIES  2002  (DCS  2002).\n\n3141\n\n701\n\n1087\n\n1364\n\n1647\n\n1835\n\n2115\n\n2507\n\n3288\n\n4335\n\n10136\n\n100\n\n2.42\n\n3.75\n\n4.7\n\n5.68\n\n6.32\n\n7.29\n\n8.64\n\n11.33\n\n14.94\n\n34.93\n\nThe income distribution situation prior to 2002 can be seen in Table 9.

However, looking only at the terminal\nyears of the data, one can say that the relative position of the poor has deteriorated in the last\nfour decades. The income of the poorest in the country fell from 18.9 percent of the income of\nthe  richest  in  1963  to  13.4  percent  in  2002.\n\nB.\n\nSectoral  Distribution\n\nThe Lorenz curve type of analysis seems to confirm the above analysis. The Gini concentration\n\ncoefficient  is  shown  on  Table  10  for  several  selected  years  for  the  period  1963-2002.\n\nTABLE 10\nGINI COEFFICIENT OF CONCENTRATION FOR INCOME RECEIVERS\n\nSECTOR\n\n1963\n\n1973\n\n78/79\n\n81/82\n\n86/87\n\n90/91\n\n95/96\n\n2002\n\nUrban\n\nRural\n\nEstate\n\nSri  Lanka\n\n0.49\n\n0.44\n\n0.27\n\n0.49\n\n0.40\n\n0.37\n\n0.37\n\n0.41\n\n0.51\n\n0.49\n\n0.32\n\n0.49\n\n0.54\n\n0.49\n\n0.32\n\n0.52\n\n0.53\n\n0.50\n\n0.31\n\n0.52\n\n0.58\n\n0.53\n\n0.36\n\n0.52\n\n0.53\n\n0.52\n\n0.37\n\n0.52\n\n0.55\n\n0.51\n\n0.39\n\n0.55\n\nSources:  HIES  (DCS  various  years);  CFS  (CBSL  various  years).\n\nThe  coefficient  suggests  a  clear  improvement  in  distribution  from  1963  to  1973,  as  it  fell\nfrom 0.49 to 0.41 over the 10-year period. However, it worsened therefrom, as it rose to 0.49 in\n1978/79,  to  0.52  over  1981/82-1995/96,  and  to  0.55  in  2002.  It  has  been  argued  that  the\nimprovement in the first decade of the data came in the wake of the pro-welfare focus of the national\npolicies up to 1977 and the deterioration thereafter as the aftermath of the policy restructuring\ntoward economic growth. However the debate goes, the causes underpinning the change in income\ndistribution  remain  to  be  unravelled.\n\nC.\n\nConsumption Distribution\n\nThe same decline in the relative standing of the poor in Sri Lankan society can be seen in\nthe distribution of consumption expenditure, as shown in Table 11. The consumption expenditure\nof the poorest\u2014the three lowest deciles\u2014as a percentage of the consumption expenditure of the\nrichest\u2014the  topmost  decile\u2014fell  from  42.9  percent  in  1995/96  to  31.4  percent  in  2002.\n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 58\n\n15\n\n\fMONETARY POVERTY ESTIMATES IN SRI LANKA:  SELECTED ISSUES\nNERANJANA GUNETILLEKE AND DINUSHKA SENANAYAKE\n\nTABLE 11\nMEAN HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURE, BY EXPENDITURE DECILE, 1995/96 AND 2002\n\nDECILES\n\n1995/96\n\nPERCENT\n\n2002\n\nPERCENT\n\nAll  Deciles\n\nLowest\n\nSecond\n\nThird\n\nFourth\n\nFifth\n\nSixth\n\nSeventh\n\nEighth\n\nNineth\n\nHighest\n\n6525\n\n1879\n\n2834\n\n3473\n\n4033\n\n4653\n\n5360\n\n6336\n\n7719\n\n10009\n\n19062\n\n100\n\n2.87\n\n4.34\n\n5.31\n\n6.17\n\n7.12\n\n8.2\n\n9.69\n\n11.81\n\n15.31\n\n29.16\n\n13733\n\n3305\n\n5047\n\n6294\n\n7637\n\n9010\n\n10565\n\n12532\n\n15367\n\n21014\n\n46645\n\n100\n\n2.4\n\n3.67\n\n4.58\n\n5.56\n\n6.56\n\n7.69\n\n9.12\n\n11.18\n\n15.29\n\n33.94\n\nSource:  HIES  1995/96  and  2002  (DCS  various  years)).\n\nV.  NONINCOME INDICATORS\n\nA.\n\nEducation\n\nData on education in Sri Lanka comes from the various sources of the Department of Census\nand  Statistics.  The  Ministry  of  Education  has  a  specialized  database  on  students,  teachers,  and\nfacilities  of  schools,  by  category,  in  all  the  country\u2019s  regions.\n\nThe  importance  of  education  as  a  fundamental  right  of  citizens  has  long  been  recognized\nby the Government of Sri Lanka. The recognition is operationalized in the form of state provision\nof universal free education. It is a measure of the success of the government\u2019s educational program\nthat  the  current  literacy  rate  for  males  is  94  percent  and  for  females  91  percent.  There  is  near\nuniversal  enrolment  at  the  primary  level.\n\nThe  relationship  of  this  high  level  of  achievement  in  the  educational  field  with  poverty\neradication is, however less clear. From the various studies that have been conducted looking into\nthe  correlation  between  education  levels  and  earning  capacity,  the  general  conclusion  seems  to\nbe that there is no positive correlation between primary education and income generation capacity.\nMost poor households are literate and have on average eight years of education. However, secondary\neducation and to a greater extent tertiary education have the potential to lift households out of\npoverty.\n\nThe current debate on education in Sri Lanka focuses on the quality of education. The data\non the performance of students at the three public examinations allows an analysis of quality to\na certain extent. However, such an examination is handicapped by data gaps on teaching methods,\ncurriculum,  etc.\n\n16\n\nOCTOBER 2004\n\n\fSECTION VI\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nB.\n\nHealth  and  Nutrition\n\nHealth is a sector with one of the most varied databases. The data collected by the Department\nof Census and Statistics is complemented by Ministry of Health sources. Detailed data pertain to\ndisease  and  epidemiology  and  the  primary  health  care  system,  and  include  such  information  as\ndoctor-patient ratios, hospitals per square area, beds per capita, etc. As in the case of education,\nthe  current  research  is  focused  strongly  on  the  quality  of  health  care.\n\nNutrition poses a special problem in Sri Lanka. Malnutrition, especially among young children,\ncontinues to cast a very dark shadow on Sri Lanka\u2019s human development achievements. Over 38\npercent of the below five age group suffer from malnutrition. The disaggregated data on income\nshow  that  over  90  percent  of  the  bottommost  quintile  of  income  earners  obtain  less  than  the\nrecommended calorie intake. Within this group the most serious problem lies with the urban sector\nhouseholds, and, in terms of occupational category, with agricultural workers. However, there is\na high rate of prevalence among the nonpoor as well. Approximately 10 percent of children under\nfive  in  the  highest  income  quintile  are  malnourished.\n\nC.\n\nEmployment\n\nUnemployment  is  an  indicator  of  poverty  as  well  as  a  key  source  of  welfare.  The  data  on\nemployment comes mainly from the Central Bank\u2019s Consumer Finances Survey, the Department of\nCensus and Statistics\u2019 Labour Force and Socio-Economic Surveys, and the subsequent Labour Force\nSurveys. The data is disaggregated by employment sectors, occupational type, region, gender, and\nage.\n\nEmployment generation is currently at the top of the government\u2019s agenda. There is particular\nconcern  for  youth  employment,  a  matter  spurred  by  the  youth  insurgencies  of  1971  and  1989/\n90, which was said to have been the result of frustration among the educated youth over the failure\nof the economy to meet the students\u2019 higher aspirations. Attention is also being focused on such\nissues as mismatch,  \u201cwho gains, who loses\u201d in the sectoral growth process, the female bias of\npoststructural adjustment employment generation, the rise of child (10-14 age group) employment,\nchanges in the quality of employment (based on the level in the occupational ladder), and the\n\u201cinformalization\u201d\u2019  of  the  labor  market.\n\nFor the immediate present, the focus of research is the restructuring of labor laws and wages.\n\nVI. CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nThe combined portfolio of quantitative data available through the Department of Census and\nStatistics, Central Bank of Sri Lanka, and other line ministry sources is fairly comprehensive. However,\na major issue that arises is the comparability of the various data sets. The data sets collected by\nline ministries and departments are frequently supervised by DCS staff members but suffer from\ncomparability problems mainly in terms of time periods used, spatial units, and at times definitions\nof  the  indicators.\n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 58\n\n17\n\n\fMONETARY POVERTY ESTIMATES IN SRI LANKA:  SELECTED ISSUES\nNERANJANA GUNETILLEKE AND DINUSHKA SENANAYAKE\n\nOn poverty issues, though the debate has a long history, gaps exist and questions regarding\nthe poverty line remained unsolved. As this paper covers this period of uncertainty, calculations\nof poverty incidence, income, or consumption distribution among income groups or across sectors,\nas briefly discussed in this paper, are at best tentative. However, the most recent outputs by the\nDCS (see Appendix 1) may go a very long way toward closing these gaps. The official poverty line\ndeclared  by  the  DCS  after  a  lengthy  and  comprehensive  study  of  the  issues  involved  has  raised\npoverty measurement in Sri Lanka to a new standard and will shift the debate to a higher level.\n\n18\n\nOCTOBER 2004\n\n\fAPPENDIX\n\nAPPENDIX\nDEPARTMENT OF CENSUS AND STATISTICS:\nOFFICIAL POVERTY LINE FOR SRI LANKA\n\nThe Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) released the official poverty line for Sri Lanka in June 2004. This\nannex provides a summary of the methodology used by the Department of Census and Statistics in calculating\nthe official poverty line, and the arising measures and trends in poverty. 11\n\nSummary of the Official Poverty Line\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n(iv)\n(v)\n\nOfficial Poverty Line for 2002: Rs. 1423\nInterpretation of the Official Poverty Line: Persons living in households whose real per capita\nmonthly total consumption expenditure is below Rs. 1423 in 2002 in Sri Lanka are considered\npoor\nType of Poverty Line: Absolute poverty line\nBase Method: Cost of Basic Needs (CBN) method\nData Source: Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) 2002\n\nCalculating the Poverty Line\n\n(i)\n\nCalculating the caloric requirement\n\nStep 1: National aggregate of daily calorie allowances is determined based on the nutritional requirements\nby  age  and  sex  as  calculated  by  the  Medical  Research  Institute  of  Sri  Lanka,  with  the  population\nsubdivided into age and sex as given by the HIES 2002.\n\nStep 2: The average calorie allowance is calculated by dividing the national aggregate by the total\npopulation. Given as 2030 kcal per capita per day in 2002.\n\n(ii)\n\nCalculating the food poverty line\n\nStep 3: A reference group comprising the 2nd-4th deciles in the real per capita total consumption\nexpenditure is selected.\n\nStep 4: All food items, which have information on quantity, expenditure, and estimated caloric value\nare selected.\n\nStep 5: Based on the above information, the aggregates of the food expenditure and caloric intakes in\nthe reference group are calculated.\n\nStep 6: Cost per calorie = aggregate food expenditure / aggregate caloric intake in reference group\n\nStep 7: Per calorie cost multiplied by nutritional anchor per month provides the food poverty line.\n\n11 For  details  please  refer  to:  http://www.statistics.gov.lk/poverty/OfficialPovertyLineBuletin.pdf.\n\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 58\n\n19\n\n\fMONETARY POVERTY ESTIMATES IN SRI LANKA:  SELECTED ISSUES\nNERANJANA GUNETILLEKE AND DINUSHKA SENANAYAKE\n\n(iii)\n\nCalculating the nonfood component of the poverty line\n\nStep  8:  The  lower  and  upper  bound  for  the  nonfood  component  is  calculated.  The  lower  bound  is\nderived by calculating the average per capita nonfood expenditure of households whose per capita\ntotal expenditure is 10 percent (plus or minus) from the food poverty line. The upper bound is derived\nby  calculating  the  average  per  capita  nonfood  expenditure  of  households\u2019  whose  per  capita  food\nexpenditure is 10 percent (plus or minus) from the food poverty line.\n\nStep 9: The upper (lower) total poverty line = food poverty line + upper (lower) nonfood component,\n\nLower poverty line = 973 + 294\nLower poverty line = Rs. 1267 per person per month\nUpper poverty line = 973 + 606\nUpper poverty line = Rs. 1579 per person per month\n\nStep 10: The national poverty line is the average of the upper and lower total poverty line.\nNational poverty line = (upper poverty line + lower poverty line)/ 2\nNational poverty line = (1267+ 1578)/ 2\nNational poverty line at 2002 national prices = Rs. 1423 per person per month\n\n(iv)\n\nCalculating poverty lines for different years\n\nThe  poverty  lines  for  the  for  the  years  1990/91  and  1995/96  are  calculated  by  deflating  the  2002\npoverty line by the Colombo Consumer Price Index.\n\nOfficial poverty lines in previous survey years at current prices are:\n1990/91 = Rs. 475 per person per month\n1995/96 = Rs. 833 per person per month\n\nThe poverty line for 2004 was calculated using the Sri Lanka Consumer Price Index on the 2002 poverty\nline: total poverty line for 2004 = Rs. 1526 per person per month.\n\n(v)\n\nRegional poverty lines\n\nThe DCS further calculates district poverty lines by adopting spatial price indices for each district. It\nis computed as a \u201cLaspeyeres\u201d index using implicit prices of food items for the reference group, which\nconsists of the 2nd-4th deciles.\n\n20\n\nOCTOBER 2004\n\n\fAPPENDIX\n\nAPPENDIX TABLE 1\nNOMINAL POVERTY LINES BY DISTRICT\n\n1990/91\n\n1995/96\n\n2002\n\nDISTRICT\n\nNational\n\nColombo\n\nGanpaha\n\nKalutara\n\nKandy\n\nMatale\n\nNuwara  Eliya\n\nGalle\n\nMatara\n\nHambantota\n\nKurunegala\n\nPuttalam\n\nAnuradhapura\n\nPolonnaruwa\n\nBadulla\n\nMoneragala\n\nRathnapura\n\nKegalle\n\n475\n\n518\n\n489\n\n494\n\n485\n\n466\n\n494\n\n489\n\n470\n\n470\n\n456\n\n461\n\n456\n\n475\n\n485\n\n480\n\n494\n\n466\n\n833\n\n908\n\n875\n\n866\n\n850\n\n816\n\n841\n\n833\n\n816\n\n791\n\n791\n\n841\n\n816\n\n783\n\n850\n\n701\n\n833\n\n858\n\n1423\n\n1537\n\n1508\n\n1523\n\n1451\n\n1395\n\n1437\n\n1466\n\n1395\n\n1338\n\n1352\n\n1423\n\n1380\n\n1366\n\n1409\n\n1366\n\n1451\n\n1437\n\nSource:  Department  of  Census  and  Statistics  (2004).\n\nThe district poverty lines adjust for \u201ccost of living\u201d differences among the various districts.
