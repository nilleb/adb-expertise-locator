Siy \n(18 January 1994)   v. \nAsian Development Bank \n \nE. Lauterpacht, Chairman \nF.P. Feliciano, Member \nM.D.H. Fernando, Member \n \n1. The Applicants, Mr. Ferdinand P. Mesch, a national of the United States of America, and Mr. \nRobert Y. Siy, a national of the Republic of the Philippines, are contesting the decision of the \nAsian Development Bank (\"the Bank\" or \"ADB\") not to reimburse income tax paid by the \nApplicants on their salaries and emoluments (\"salaries\") derived from employment with the \nBank. The Applicant Mr. Mesch has been employed since 25 February 1980 as a Senior \nCounsel, Level 6, in the Office of the General Counsel under a regular appointment; the \nApplicant Mr. Siy has been employed under a similar appointment since 23 June 1989 as an \nEvaluation Specialist, Level 4, in the Post-Evaluation Office. \n \n2. The Applicants' grievance is that their salaries, after deduction of income tax levied by the \nGovernments of the United States of America and of the Republic of the Philippines, are below \nthe amounts that have been set by the Bank as appropriate for their respective levels of \nemployment. The Applicants contend that the Bank is thus in breach of its obligation to provide \nequal compensation for comparable work, which they interpret as \"equal net-of-tax pay for equal \nwork.\" \n \n3(a) Gross salaries were paid by the Bank to the Applicants on exactly the same basis as other \nemployees who were nationals of other countries, holding comparable posts and performing like \nfunctions. However, the net salaries of the Applicants after taxation were obviously less than the \nsalaries retained by those of their colleagues who were not liable to taxation.  \n \n3(b) From the inception of the ADB, its principal comparator organization for the purpose of \nmaintaining a competitive salary structure was the International Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment (\"IBRD\"). The IBRD determines the salaries of its own staff as if they were tax-\nexempt and, where income tax is payable, provides for reimbursement of tax paid thereon. Thus \nthe IBRD not only assumes that staff salaries are formally tax-exempt; it also ensures that they \nare effectively so. In contrast to this, the ADB, though also determining the salaries of its \nprofessional staff as if they were tax-exempt, does not reimburse national income tax if levied \nand does not make any additional payment to ensure that result. Consequently, those \nprofessional staff members whose salaries are liable to such income tax receive less by way of \nremuneration (lower after-tax salaries) than do their counterparts at the IBRD. \n \n3(c) Thus, in 1991 Mr. Mesch received a basic salary of US$82,590, and allowances amounting \nto US$17,755, on which he paid United States income tax of US$3,739. Mr. Siy received a \nsalary of US$60,362, on which he paid Philippine income tax amounting to US$18,718, leaving \nhim with US$41,644. During that period, the Bank's salary scales entitled a staff member at \nLevel 4 to a minimum annual salary of US$54,230. Mr. Siy, however, received much less - even \nless than the minimum of US$43,910 fixed for staff two levels below. Further, his after-tax salary \nwas more than 30% below the salary of his counterparts in the IBRD. ", " \n4. By memorandum dated 10 February 1992 to the Manager, Compensation and Benefits \nDivision (\"BPCB\"), the Applicants claimed that they were entitled to receive \"net-of-tax \ncompensation\", i.e., payment of an amount which, even after taxes had been paid, would be \nequal to their nominal gross salaries. Accordingly, they requested the Management of the Bank \nto reimburse the income tax paid by them. On 20 July 1992 the Management informed the \nApplicants that they were not entitled to such reimbursement. Requests for review of that \ndecision were unsuccessful. On 3 September 1992 the Applicants were informed that the \nPresident of the Bank would agree, under Article II, Section 3(a) of the Statute of the Tribunal, to \nthe Applicants submitting their Application directly to the Tribunal. Thereupon, this Application \nwas filed on 11 September 1992. \n \n5. The Applicants allege that the Bank's failure to observe the practice of \"net-of-tax \ncompensation\" and to reimburse income tax paid by them: \n \na.  is in breach of the Bank's obligation to pay the Applicants salaries which are \"equitable \nand competitive\" i.e., internally as well as externally vis-\u00e0-vis its comparator \norganization, the IBRD; \n \nb.  \"results in non-observance of the fundamental and essential conditions of [their] terms of \nappointment\" and is also in violation of relevant Administrative Orders - in particular, \nAdministrative Order 2.04: \n \nc.  \"3.3 . . . Subject to reasonable variations that recognize difference in previous \nexperience, length of service in the Bank, quality of performance and relevant factors, \nequal compensation will be provided to staff members performing comparable work.\" \n \n \nd.  is contrary to \"the body of international law governing all major public international \norganizations, derived from 'international custom, as evidence of a general practice \naccepted as law'\"; and \n \ne.  undermines Articles 36.2 and 36.3 of the Articles of Agreement Establishing the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (\"the Charter\"). \n \n6. The principal items of relief claimed by the Applicants are:  \n \na.  \"the adjustment of [their] salaries so that [their] full salaries are received on a net-of-tax \nbasis and fall within the net-of-tax salary ranges for [their] respective levels\"; \n \nb.  the reimbursement of \"the additional amounts paid in taxes by [the Applicants] in order to \nset the Applicants' past salaries on a net-of-tax basis, plus interest at an appropriate \nannual rate on these amounts\"; and \n \nc.  that \"the Bank should ensure that equal net-of-tax compensation is provided to staff \nmembers performing comparable work in order to implement correctly Section 3.3 of \nAdministrative Order 2.04 and other policies that provide for equal pay for equal work.\" \n \n \n \n ", " \n \n7. The principal question raised by the Application is whether the terms and conditions of \nemployment of the Applicants require the Bank to reimburse income tax levied on their salaries \nby the member States of which they were nationals. \n \n8. The parties accept that the terms and conditions of employment of the Applicants are to be \ndetermined by reference to the Applicants' letters of appointment, the Bank's Charter, By-Laws, \nAdministrative Orders and Regulations, Personnel Policy Statements and Handbooks. \n \nThe letters of appointment \n \n9(a) The letter of appointment of Mr. Mesch stated that: \"You may note that salaries of foreign \nprofessional staff are not subject to taxation by the Government of the Republic of the \nPhilippines\", \n \nbut made no reference to the subject of income taxation by the United States. The letter \nof appointment of Mr. Siy said nothing whatsoever on the subject of income taxation.  \n \n9(b) Thus the letters of appointment did not contain either representations that the Applicants \nwould not (then or in the future) be subject to income tax in their respective home countries or \nundertakings to make any form of tax reimbursement; nor did these letters expressly provide \nthat it was the policy or practice of the Bank not to make such reimbursement.  \n \n9(c) Both letters of appointment also stated that:  \n \n\"As a staff member of the Bank, you will be subject to present and future administrative \nregulations for the governance of such staff.\" \n \nThe Charter and By-Laws \n \n10. The Tribunal will next examine whether any of the Bank's internal documents establish a \nright to tax reimbursement. The first document to be considered in this connection is the Charter \nof the Bank. \n \n11(a) Article 56.2 of the Charter provides: \n \n\"No tax shall be levied on or in respect of salaries and emoluments paid by the Bank to \nDirectors, alternates, officers or employees of the Bank, including experts performing \nmissions for the Bank, except where a member deposits with its instrument of ratification \nor acceptance a declaration that such member retains for itself and its political \nsubdivisions the right to tax salaries and emoluments paid by the Bank to citizens or \nnationals of such member.\" Of 52 member States, 17 deposited such declarations, \nincluding the United States and the Republic of the Philippines. These two countries, \nhowever, are the only ones that actually levy income tax upon the salaries of their \nnationals employed in the Bank. \n \nThe Bank's By-Laws have been silent, from the inception of the Bank, as to reimbursement of \nincome tax paid by staff or the payment of any allowance in lieu thereof. \n ", "11(b) It may be observed in passing that the corresponding provision of the Articles of \nAgreement establishing the IBRD (\"the IBRD Charter\") is Article VII, Section 9(b):  \n \n\"No tax shall be levied on or in respect of salaries and emoluments paid by the Bank to \nexecutive directors, alternates, officials or employees of the Bank who are not local \ncitizens, local subjects, or other local nationals.\" \n \nResolution 11 of the Board of Directors of the IBRD, adopted at its inaugural meeting on 16 \nMarch 1946, stated: \n \n\"Appropriate measures for the elimination or equalization of the burden of national taxes \nupon salaries and allowances paid [by the World Bank] are indispensable to the \nachievement of equity among its members and equality among its personnel.\" \n \nSection 14(b) of the IBRD's By-Laws (prior to 1980) provided that: \n \n\"Pending the necessary action being taken by members to exempt from national taxation \nsalaries and allowances paid out of the budget of the Bank, the Governors and the \nExecutive Directors, and their Alternates, the President, and the staff members shall be \nreimbursed by the Bank for the taxes which they are required to pay on such salaries \nand allowances.\" \n \nThis was amended in 1980 to provide in lieu of such reimbursement: \n \n\"a tax allowance that the Executive Directors determine to be reasonably related to the \ntaxes paid by them on such salaries and allowances.\" \n \nSubsequent to that amendment the IBRD letter of appointment stated: \n \n\"If you are liable for the payment of national income taxes on the remuneration you \nreceive from the World Bank, you will receive from the World Bank a tax allowance as \ndetermined by the Executive Directors of the World Bank.\" \n \nThus, tax reimbursement was an express condition of employment in the IBRD; that condition \nwas based upon a principle expressly adopted by the IBRD, namely, that the elimination of \nnational taxes on staff salaries, or the equalization of the burden, was indispensable to equality \namong staff members.  \n \n11(c) Relying on the discussions preparatory to the adoption of the ADB's Charter, the \nApplicants contend that the intention of those who drafted that Charter was that Article 56.2 \nwould necessitate a net-of-tax compensation system and that the Bank would be obliged to \nreimburse national income tax on staff salaries as a consequence of accommodating States \nwhich reserved their right to tax. The Tribunal observes that no such intention appears on the \nface of Article 56.2 and, having examined the proceedings of the Preparatory Committees relied \non by both parties, it has been unable to discern either any such intention or any contrary \nintention.  \n \n11(d) It is the contention of the ADB that although the Charter of the IBRD did not prohibit the \nlevying of taxes by a member State on the salaries of its nationals, the IBRD expressly \nundertook, by resolution of its Board and by its By-Laws, an obligation to reimburse national \nincome tax on staff salaries; that there were other international organizations which had a tax ", "reimbursement system; and that the ADB is different, having recognized by its Charter the right \nof member States to reserve the right to tax their nationals and having deliberately refrained in \nits By-Laws and resolutions from adopting any tax reimbursement system. The ADB further \ncontends that the adoption of a system of tax reimbursement would be contrary to its Charter. \nHowever, the Tribunal notes that there is nothing in the Charter which prohibits the Bank from \nundertaking an obligation to reimburse national income tax on staff salaries. It is, therefore, \nnecessary to examine the administrative regulations of the Bank, as well as other Bank \ndocuments setting out its personnel and salary policies, in order to ascertain whether the Bank \nhas subsequently assumed or excluded any such obligation. \n \nPersonnel and salary policies \n \n12(a) Administrative Instruction ADM-7 (dated 27 April 1967) set out as follows one of the \"Basic \nPrinciples Governing Salary Administration\": \n \n\"It is the policy of the Bank to provide equal compensation to staff members performing \ncomparable work, subject to reasonable variations that recognize differences in previous \nexperience, length of service in the Bank, quality of performance and similar factors.\" \n(Emphasis supplied). \n \n12(b) Although this Instruction was replaced by Administrative Order No 2.04 of 30 May 1972, \nthe same principle was maintained: \n \n\"3(b) Salaries will be maintained at levels competitive with those prevailing in \ncomparable organizations and in the market from which the Bank seeks to recruit its \nstaff.  \n \n3(c) . . . Subject to reasonable variations that recognize differences in previous \nexperience, length of service in the Bank, quality of performance and relevant factors, \nequal compensation will be provided to staff members performing comparable work. \n \n. . . . \n \n7.4. The Director of Administration is responsible for ensuring that salary administration \npolicies are applied equitably and consistently throughout the Bank.\" (Emphasis \nsupplied). \n \nSimilar provision was made in subsequent revisions of Administrative Order 2.04 which now, in \nits latest form (as revised 1 November 1993, Administrative Order No. 3.01), provides: \n \n\"3(a) Salaries will be designed to attract and retain a highly qualified and competent staff \nand to motivate the highest standards of performance by all staff members. \n \n3(b) Salaries will be maintained at levels competitive with those prevailing in comparable \norganizations and with due regard to the locational considerations of the Bank's \nHeadquarters . . .  \n \n3(c) The Bank will systematically evaluate the relative levels of each position, the \nequitable remuneration for similar responsibilities internally and externally, and reward \nstaff according to performance, length of service and other relevant factors. ", "3(d) Salaries will be administered in a manner that is both equitable and transparent to \nall staff.\" (Emphasis supplied). \n \n12(c) The same principle of equality, though not stated in identical terms, is contained in the \nPersonnel Policy Statement approved by the Board of Directors on 7 December 1990:  \n \n\"(i) In its staffing, the Bank gives paramount importance to securing the highest \nstandards of efficiency and technical competence . . . . \n \n(ii) The Bank's salaries, allowances and benefits will be maintained at competitive levels \nwith due regard to the locational considerations of the Bank's Headquarters . . . . \n \n(vi) The Bank will systematically evaluate the relative levels of jobs, the equitable \nremuneration for similar responsibilities internally and externally, and reward staff \naccording to performance, length of service and other relevant factors.\" (Emphasis \nsupplied). \n \n12(d) Nothing contrary to this principle of equality in salaries is stated in the Bank's Personnel \nHandbook for Professional Staff (effective 1 April 1991): \n \n\"4.2 Compensation \n \nRemuneration Principles \n \nThe overall objective of the Bank's remuneration policy is to enable it to recruit and retain \nhighly qualified and competent staff on a geographical basis which reflects the Bank's \nmembership. \n \nA competitive salary, paid in United States dollars, is offered to you, taking into account \nrelevant qualifications and experience, within the salary range corresponding to the \nclassification of your job. Salaries for new staff members are generally computed on the \nbasis of comparability with other jobs and with other staff in service who have equivalent \nor similar qualifications and experience and who are at the same position level.  \n \nSalaries and benefits paid to expatriate staff are exempt from taxation by the Philippine \nGovernment in accordance with the provisions of the Headquarters Agreement. Under \ntax legislation in most countries, this remuneration is exempt from home country taxes \nas well.  \n \nActual salary levels are regularly monitored and reviewed to ensure that the Bank retains \nits competitiveness within the international market and maintains a reasonable degree of \ncomparability with similar international institutions, principally the World Bank Group. \nBased on these reviews, the Bank from time to time revises its salary ranges and \nindividual salaries by means of a general salary increase (GSI), in the form of a \npercentage adjustment.\" \n \nThe same is true of the Bank's booklet entitled Staff Appointments with the Asian Development \nBank, which refers also to regular salary reviews \n ", "\"in order to ensure that the Bank retains its competitiveness within the international \nmarket and maintains a reasonable degree of comparability with similar institutions \n(principally, the World Bank Group).\" (Emphasis supplied). \n \n12(e) With the exception of United States and Philippine nationals, all professional staff of the \nBank receive salaries which are tax-exempt and which are, therefore, equal to the salaries of \ntheir colleagues performing comparable work in the Bank, and are also comparable with the \nsalaries of their counterparts in the IBRD.  \n \nOther documents \n \n13(a) On 10 October 1975 the President of the Bank sent a telex to the United States Secretary \nof the Treasury when he became aware that the House of Representatives of the United States \nwas considering a proposal to eliminate the foreign earned-income exclusion (of about \nUS$20,000) then available to the American staff of the Bank. He stated:  \n \n\"The Bank, unlike certain other international organizations, is not in a position to \nreimburse national taxes assessed against its staff members, and the Bank salary \nstructure is based on the assumption that staff salaries are not subject to national \nincome taxation. \n \n\"The effect of the proposed legislation would be to reduce the net salaries of Americans \non our staff sharply. I feel it would depress the relative living standard of Americans \ncompared to their associates. This will seriously affect our ability to attract and hold \nhighly qualified Americans on our staff and I am concerned that it will inevitably have an \nadverse impact on the American presence in the Bank.\" \n \nThe Bank thus recognized that the levy of income tax on salaries of American staff would create \na significant inequality.  \n \n13(b) The Applicants also rely on a memorandum dated 18 September 1981 from the General \nCounsel and the Director, Budget, Personnel and Management Systems Department \n(\"BPMSD\"), to the President of the Bank regarding a proposal by the United States Department \nof the Treasury (\"Treasury\") to make funds available to the Bank for the partial reimbursement \nof 1980 United States taxes paid by American staff members. According to that memorandum, \nin response to requests made by the Bank to the United States Government to provide relief for \nthe American staff, the United States Treasury determined that it had authority to make such \nreimbursement. Thereafter, an Agreement was concluded and the Treasury paid US$500,000 to \nthe Bank to be used for such reimbursement. That Agreement described these payments as \n\"Salary Equalization Payments.\" Although it was not the Bank which provided the funds for \nthese payments, the Tribunal considers that this Agreement demonstrates that the United \nStates Government and the Bank recognized that tax reimbursement was both legitimate and \nproper to restore equality in respect of salaries of professional staff. \n \nConclusions \n \n14. The resulting position may be summarized as follows. The Charter, By-Laws and Board \nResolutions did not establish any obligation of the Bank in respect of the reimbursement of \nincome tax levied on staff salaries; equally, however, those documents did not prohibit the \nadoption of any such obligation. Likewise, although the letters of appointment issued by the \nBank to professional staff did not include any express undertaking to reimburse income tax, ", "nevertheless they did not specifically exclude that prospect. There was thus no pronouncement \nby the Bank as to the exclusion of tax reimbursement. Moreover, the letters of appointment sent \nto staff members made the Bank's administrative regulations part of the contract between the \nBank and the staff members. Accordingly, from 1967 onwards, the principle of equal \ncompensation for comparable work (contained in Administrative Instruction ADM-7) was part of \nthe terms and conditions of all staff members; and by 1972 the Bank acknowledged the need to \napply salary policies equitably throughout the Bank. Thereafter, the Bank accepted, in principle \nand in practice, that its professional staff were entitled to \"equitable remuneration\" both \ninternally (in relation to their colleagues in the Bank) and externally (i.e., bearing \"a reasonable \ndegree of comparability\" with the remuneration of their IBRD counterparts).  \n \n15. The Tribunal observes that the comparison of compensation levels on the practical plane \nnecessarily involves a consideration of the net benefits, after tax if any, to the recipient. \nTherefore, it cannot be said that a given salary which, in the hands of one recipient, is taxable is \nthe same as an identical figure which, in the hands of another, is not. Accordingly, the failure to \nconsider the incidence of taxation is inconsistent with the principle of \"equal compensation for \ncomparable work.\" \n \n16. The Tribunal is conscious that the implementation of this principle will increase the overall \namounts that the Bank must pay to the professional staff. However, that is not a reason for \nrejecting the logical operation of the principle of equality. The ultimate financial consequences of \nthe proper application of the principle of equal compensation for comparable work, to which the \nBank has subscribed since its earliest days, are something that can only be worked out between \nthe Bank and its Members.  \n \n17. In balancing in the present case the equities as between the Bank and its staff, the Tribunal \nconsiders that more weight should be given to the interests of the employee than to those of the \nemployer, if only because the Bank could have so structured its terms of employment as to \nexclude expressly the prospect of equal pay for comparable work and could thus have excluded \nthe need for tax reimbursement. But it never did so. Any ambiguity or uncertainty in this respect, \nwherever appearing in documents emanating from the Bank must, therefore, be resolved contra \nproferentem and in favor of the staff.  \n \n18. The Tribunal accordingly holds that the terms and conditions of employment of the \nApplicants require the Bank to reimburse income tax levied on their salaries.  \n \n19. In view of its conclusion on this question, the Tribunal does not need to consider the further \nquestions that have been posed and examined by the parties, namely: \n \nWhether there is a principle of international law, custom or practice which imposes an \nobligation on international organizations to reimburse national taxes levied on salaries of \ntheir professional staff and, if so, whether the Bank was bound by it? \n \nWhether the levy of national taxes by member States on the salaries of Bank staff \nundermines the provisions of Articles 36.2 and 36.3 \"36.2 The Bank, its President, Vice-\nPresident(s), officers and staff shall not interfere in the political affairs of any member, \nnor shall they be influenced in their decisions by the political character of the member \nconcerned. Only economic considerations shall be relevant to their decisions. Such \nconsiderations shall be weighed impartially in order to achieve and carry out the purpose \nand functions of the Bank. \n ", "36.3 The President, Vice President(s), officers and staff of the Bank, in the discharge of \ntheir offices, owe their duty entirely to the Bank and to no other authority. Each member \nof the Bank shall respect the international character of this duty and shall refrain from all \nattempts to influence any of them in the discharge of their duties.\" of the Charter and, if \nso, was there an obligation on the Bank to reimburse such taxes levied by member \nStates in order to prevent those Articles being undermined\"? \n \n20. The Tribunal observes, however, that although there are notable differences in the \nmechanisms adopted by the United Nations and its Specialized Agencies, the IBRD, the \nInternational Monetary Fund, the Inter-American Development Bank, and some other \ninternational organizations, they all succeed in achieving effective equality among comparable \nstaff members of the organization in respect of after-tax salaries. \n \nRelief \n \n21. The Tribunal must now consider the relief to which the Applicants are entitled. While there \nis, no doubt, force in the argument that the Applicants are entitled to reimbursement of taxes \nfrom the beginning of their respective periods of employment with the Bank, it appears to the \nTribunal that such a solution entails so many practical difficulties - especially in view of the \nimplications of the Tribunal's decision for other members of the professional staff in situations \ncomparable to those of the Applicants - that it must be excluded. Self-evidently, it would only be \nwith the greatest difficulty that the financial arrangements of the Bank could be adjusted to cover \nthe re-opening of its salary payments for many years back. \n \n22. Moreover, although it was a term or condition of employment of each of the Applicants that \nhe was entitled to reimbursement of income tax levied on his salary, the Bank's obligation of \nreimbursement in each case could have arisen only upon a reasonably prompt claim being \nmade, accompanied by proof of payment of such tax. The Tribunal observes that despite the \nfact that the Applicant Mr. Mesch commenced employment with the Bank on 25 February 1980, \nand the Applicant Mr. Siy did so on 23 June 1989, it was not until 10 February 1992 that the \nApplicants made their first formal representations to the Bank seeking reimbursement of taxes. \nPayment of tax in respect of the year 1990 would, in the normal course, have been made in \n1991. The Tribunal considers, therefore, that it would be reasonable and equitable to entertain \nthe Applicants' claims for reimbursement of tax paid for the years 1990 and 1991, but that the \nclaims made in respect of previous years are belated and cannot be entertained. \n \n23. It hardly needs saying that the concept of \"tax reimbursement\" means reimbursement only \nfor income tax actually payable and paid in respect of salaries received from the Bank. Each \nApplicant's entitlement to such reimbursement in each case must be restricted to the amount of \nincome tax payable and paid by him on the assumption that the salary received from the Bank \nconstituted his total income. Further, in determining the reimbursable amount of income tax paid \nby each Applicant, any tax credits or benefits to which he is entitled under his national tax \nsystem must be applied first in respect of his salary from the Bank.  \n \nDecision: \n \nFor these reasons the Tribunal unanimously decides that:  \n \na.  in principle, the terms and conditions of employment of the Applicants entitle them to \nreimbursement (computed in the manner stated in paragraph 23) of income tax levied \nand paid on their salaries; ", " \n \n \nb.  the Bank shall reimburse the Applicants the income tax levied and paid on their salaries \nbeginning with the year 1990 together with interest at 5% per annum from 10 February \n1992 in respect of the years 1990 and 1991; and \n \nc.  all other claims of the Applicants are dismissed. \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "e3v", "Creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Office Word 2007", "CreationDate": "D:20110420160146", "ModDate": "D:20110420160146", "Producer": "Microsoft\u00ae Office Word 2007"}}
