With\nthis recognition, emphasis on the development of\nthe  microfinance  industry  has  been  increasing\neverywhere, from major funding agencies like the\nAsian Development Bank to developing countries\nin  the  region  and  elsewhere.  The  industry  has\nmade considerable progress during the last decade.\nThe  landscape  of  the  industry  is  also  changing;\nregulated financial institutions are making inroads\ninto the industry. Many service providers seem to\nrecognize the business opportunities in the sector\nand  the  opportunities  to  combine  business\npropositions  with  social  missions  or  social\nmissions with business propositions. The service\nproviders  have  to  find  profitable  ways  of\nexpanding the outreach. That is the only promising\nway to fill the still wide gap between the demand\nfor financial services of the poor and low-income\nhouseholds and the supply of those services.\n\nMibanco\u2019s story is interesting in this respect.\nFirst,  it  began  as  a  nongovernment  organization\nwith  a  strong  social  mission.  Second,  after\ntransforming \ninto  a  regulated  financial\ninstitution\u2014a microfinance commercial bank\u2014its\noutreach  expanded  rapidly.  But  the  bank\nmaintained its focus on initial target groups\u2014the\npoor  and  low-income  households  and  their\nmicroenterprises.  And  it  expanded  profitably.\nThird,  it  operates  primarily  in  urban  areas.  In\nAsia, most microfinance institutions (MFIs) have\nnot  paid  adequate  attention  to  urban\nmicrofinance. However, research studies seem\nto suggest that urbanization of poverty in Asia\nis increasing. In this context, Asian MFIs may\nneed  to  pay  greater  attention  to  urban\nmicrofinance  markets  than  in  the  past.\nMibanco\u2019s experience can provide some lessons\nas well as inspiration, even though it comes from\na  far  away  region  of  Latin  America.\n\nJan P.M. van Heeswijk\nDirector  General\nRegional and Sustainable Development Department\n\nv\n\n\f\fABSTRACT\n\norganization \n\nT his  paper  presents  the  case  of  Mibanco\n\n(\u201cmy  bank\u201d),  a  leading  microfinance\ncommercial  bank  in  Peru  that  grew  out  of  the\nnongovernment \nAcci\u00f3n\nComunitaria del Per\u00fa (ACP). ACP initially had\nto  go  through  a  difficult  period  because  of\nmacroeconomic  instability  in  the  country,  but\nwith the return of stability grew rapidly in the\nlate 1990s. It was transformed into a commercial\nbank in May 1998. Mibanco experienced strong\ngrowth,  expanded  its  depth  and  breadth  of\noutreach  and  scope  of  services,  and  thereby\nenhanced  its  value  to  clients  during  the  post-\ntransformation period. Its loyalty to the original\n\nmission  of  serving  the  poor  and  low-income\nhouseholds and their microenterprises is reflected\npartly  in  the  pro-poor  housing  loan  product\n(Micasa\u2014\u201dmy home\u201d)  it  introduced  in  2000.\nMibanco  is  also  expanding  its  operations  from\nurban to rural areas. The bank has diversified its\nsources  of  funds  and  increased  its  reliance  on\ndeposits. It also tapped capital markets through a\nbond issue in 2002. The story of Mibanco provides\nimportant lessons for policymakers, practitioners,\nand funding agencies; it is a story of commercial\nmicrofinance  with  a  human  face.  Microfinance\ninstitutions in Asia that focus largely on the rural\nsector can benefit from its lessons.\n\nvii\n\n\f\fI.\n\nINTRODUCTION1\n\nT he  fundamental  problem,  and  the  most\n\nimportant  challenge,  in  the  microfinance\nindustry is how to fill the enormous gap between\nthe  effective  demand  for  a  wide  range  of\nmicrofinancial  services  and  the  supply  of  such\nservices on a sustainable basis. This is universal.\nIn  most  countries  including  those,  such  as\nBangladesh,  Bolivia,  and  Indonesia,  where  the\nsupply has grown rapidly over the last decade or\nso,  a  wide  gap  continues  to  exist.  This  is  why\nmicrofinance  institutions  (MFIs),  such  as\nMibanco,  that  grow  rapidly  and  profitably  are\nimportant. The industry\u2019s promise to narrow the\ndemand-supply gap rests firmly on institutions\nlike  Mibanco.\n\nMibanco  (\u201cmy  bank\u201d)  grew  from  the\nnongoverment  organization  (NGO)  Acci\u00f3n\nComunitaria  del  Per\u00fa  (ACP),  started  in  January\n1969 by a group of business people with assistance\nfrom ACCION International.2 ACP\u2019s objective was\nto  create  development  opportunities  for  low-\nincome  Peruvians.  In  1982,  ACP  began\nmicrolending operations in the southern section\nof metropolitan Lima, with assistance provided by\nBanco Wiese, one of the largest commercial banks\n\nin Peru.3 This operation grew slowly in the 1980s\nand until about 1993. Since then it has experienced\nexplosive  growth.  ACP  evolved  to  be  the  first\ncommercial  bank  in  Peru,  and  second  in  Latin\nAmerica,  with  its  core  business  focused  on\nproviding financial services to the poor and low-\nincome households and their microenterprises.\nThe  story  of  Mibanco  is  fascinating:  its\ngrowth  has  been  remarkable,  and  performance\nexemplary in many respects. In less than 5 years\nsince the transformation, it has joined a still small\ngroup  of  microfinance  commercial  banks  in  the\nglobal microfinance industry that profitably serve\na  large  number  of  clients  in  the  low  end  of  the\nmarket. Mibanco provides important lessons for\nMFIs and other stakeholders in Peru and elsewhere.\nMFI  leaders,  policymakers,  and  promoters  of\nsustainable microfinance in Asia in particular can\nlearn  important  lessons  from  the  Mibanco\nexperience, although admittedly it is a small MFI,\ncompared  to  such  MFIs  as  the  Association  for\nSocial  Advancement  (ASA)  and  the  Bangladesh\nRural  Advancement  Committee  (BRAC)  in\nBangladesh,  and  Unit  Desas  of  the  Bank  Rakyat\nIndonesia.4\n\n1 This paper has benefited from assistance provided by several colleagues. Joji Tokeshi and Edgard Rodriguez helped translate\nMibanco\u2019s  financial  statements  from  Spanish  to  English.  Joji  Tokeshi  also  searched  the  web  site  of  the  Peruvian\nSuperintendency of Banking and Insurance and that of Mibanco to obtain additional data and information.

ACCION\nhas been supporting a network of microfinance institutions throughout Latin America. It recently started operations in\nthe African region. For details, see www.accion.org.\n\n3 ACP  started  as  a  multiservice  organization  working  in  such  areas  of  development  as  health,  education,  training,  and\ncredit. But it soon realized that it had to choose one area and focus on that to have a significant development impact.\n4 For example, ASA had 1.976 million active borrowers at the end of 2002, with an outstanding gross loan portfolio of about\n$159 million. BRAC disbursed $294 million in microloans during 2002. Unit Desas had 27.6 million deposit accounts and\n2.65 million loan accounts at the end of 2001.\n\nIntroduction 1\n\n\f\fII. OPERATIONS OF\n\nACCI\u00d3N COMUNITARIA DEL  PER\u00da\n\nACP and Its Operations5\n\nLike  most  other  NGOs  involved  in\nmicrocredit  in  the  region,  ACP  focused  its\noperations  on  urban  areas.  Its  aim  was  to  serve\nthe target group in Lima City and its suburbs. There\nwere  fertile  grounds  for  its  operations  in  these\nareas,  with  a  large  population  of  poor  and  low-\nincome households, most living in shanty towns\nbut involved in a wide range of microenterprises\nto earn their living, and without access to reliable\nfinancial  services  at  reasonable  prices.  They\nwere not seen as potential clients by any of the\ncommercial banks in the city at that time. Nor\ndid  they  have  access  to  subsidized  credit\nprovided  by  government-owned  or  controlled\ninstitutions.\n\nACP adopted both solidarity and individual\nlending  methodologies  to  provide  its  credit\nservices.  Technical  assistance  provided  by\nACCION  International  helped  ACP  build  its\ncapacity to grow over time. During the first 3 years\nits  growth  was  lackluster.  However,  in  1986,  its\noutreach  increased  rapidly\u2014by  254%\u2014and  in\n1987,  its  loan  disbursements  peaked  at  $5.8\nmillion.  Then,  came  the  sharp  deterioration  of\nmacroeconomic  conditions  in  the  country,\nparticularly hyperinflation (Table 1), which had a\ndevastating effect on all financial institutions in\nPeru. ACP had to close two of its four branches in\n1988. In 1989, it disbursed only $700,000 to 9,000\nclients\u2014far below the level of its 1986 operations.\nThe portfolio quality also started to deteriorate in\n1989.  The  portfolio  at  risk  (PAR)  over  30  days\nreached an alarming level of 9% in 1990 and then\nincreased to a crippling level of 16% in 1991, even\nthough  the  total  numbers  of  borrowers  in  1990\nand  1991  were  only  about  3,000  and  2,200,\nrespectively. Hyperinflation was a major factor that\ncontributed to deterioration of the portfolio quality.\n\nTable 1\nPeru\u2019s  Annual  Inflation  Rate\n(1982\u20131992)\n\nAnnual  Inflation  Rate  (%)\n\nYear\n\n1982\n1983\n1984\n1985\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n\n64\n111\n110\n163\n78\n86\n667\n3,399\n7,482\n410\n74\n\nSource: World Bank, World Development Indicators 2002.\n\nHowever,  ACP  managed  to  lower  its  PAR\nsubstantially in 1992.\n\nACP entered a rapid growth path in 1994.\nAs shown in Table 2, annual loan disbursements\nincreased more than four-fold from $15.3 million\nin 1994 to $65.5 million in 1997. This was an\nextremely  high  level  for  an  NGO  in  Latin\nAmerica. ACP\u2019s loan portfolio of $2.28 million\nat the end of 1994 also more than quadrupled\nby the end of 1996 to $9.67 million. At the end\nof 1997, it had an active loan portfolio of $12.55\nmillion.\n\nTable 2\nACP Growth Indicators\n($ million)\n\nIndicator\n\n1994 1995 1996 1997\nAmount  of  Loans  Disbursed a 15.33 39.36 58.64 65.47\nActive  Loan  Portfolio b\n  2.28   6.77   9.67 12.55\n\na During each year.\nb As of end of each year.\n\nSource: www.accion.org.\n\n5 This section draws extensively, but not exclusively, on Campion et al. (2002).\n\nOperations of Acci\u00f3n Comunitaria del Per\u00fa 3\n\n\fThe portfolio growth stemmed more from\nthe  increase  in  the  number  of  borrowers  than\nfrom  the  increase  in  the  average  active  loan\nbalance. The contribution of the increase in the\nnumber  of  borrowers  to  the  portfolio  growth\nranged between 75% in 1994 and 93% in 1995,\nas  shown  in  Table  3.  This  confirms  that  the\ngrowth  path  was  primarily  horizontal.\n\nnational product (GNP) per capita. This increased\nto  $374  by  the  end  of  1997,  but  was  still  about\n15.6%  of  the  GNP  per  capita.  The  inflation-\nadjusted average active loan balance was only $278\nin 1997 (Figure 1). ACP\u2019s clients were largely poor\npeople  living  in  shanties  in  Lima  and  suburbs.\nAbout  61%  of  the  clients  were  women,  who\nsuffered disproportionately from many aspects of\npoverty.\n\nFigure 1\nACP: Depth of Outreach\n\nTable 3\nACP: Sources of Growth in Loan Portfolio\n(%)\n\nSource  and  Relative\nContribution\n\n1994 1995 1996 1997\n\nIncrease  in  Active  Borrowers\n\n  75\n\n  93\n\n 88\n\n 78\n\nIncrease  in  Average  Active\n\nLoan  Balance\n\nTotal  Contribution\n\nSource: Author\u2019s computations.\n\n  25\n\n100\n\n    7\n\n100\n\n  12\n\n100\n\n 22\n\n100\n\nACP did well in terms of breadth of outreach\nas well, serving a large number of new clients every\nyear, in addition to its repeat clients. As shown in\nTable  4,  the  total  number  of  active  borrowers\nincreased more than threefold from 9,023 in 1994\nto 33,549 at the end of 1997. Because ACP provided\nonly working capital loans, it could focus on this\nsingle product and increase the number of clients\nrapidly.\n\nBy  end-1997,  ACP\u2019s  loans  were  still\nrelatively  small  and  ACP  remained  well  within\nthe boundaries of its mission to serve low-income\nhouseholds. At the end of 1994, the average active\nloan balance was only $253, about 12% of the gross\n\nTable 4\nACP  Outreach\n(year-end positions)\n\nNumber  of\nActive\nBorrowers\n\nNumber  of\nNew\nBorrowers\n\nPercentage  of\nWomen\nBorrowers\n\n  9,023\n\n19,254\n\n26,768\n\n33,549\n\n  6,566\n\n15,163\n\n17,524\n\n18,253\n\n58\n\n57\n\n59\n\n61\n\nYear\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1997\n\n4\n\nSource: www. accion.org\n\nThere were at least three remarkable features\n\nof ACP\u2019s growth during 1994\u20131997.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nFirst,  this  growth  was  achieved  while\nmaintaining  a  reasonably  good  level  of\nportfolio  quality.  PAR  over  30  days  was\nconsistently  below  5%  during  1994\u20131995.\nAlthough it rose to about 7.5% in 1996, ACP\nmanaged to bring it down to 5% by the end\nof 1997.\nSecond,  ACP  maintained  its  focus  on  the\ntarget market, as stated earlier.\nThird, neither its rapid growth nor its focus\non the low end of the market deterred it from\n\n\fbeing profitable. ACP was one of the most\nprofitable  MFIs  in  the  region.  In  1995,  it\ngenerated a massive 83.5% return on equity\n(ROE). In 1996 and 1997, its ROE was 46.6%\nand  30.1%,  respectively,  even  higher  than\nthose  of  commercial  banks  in  the  country\n(www.microrate.com).  ACP\u2019s  commercial\npricing policy, high loan recovery rates, and\nhigh turnover of loans contributed to these\nhigh returns.\n\nACP\u2019s overall achievements were facilitated\nin  no  small  measure  by  the  macroeconomic\nstability  in  the  mid-1990s  (Figure  2),  effective\ntechnical  assistance  provided  by  ACCION\nInternational, and, of course, by the high quality\nand dedication of its staff and management.\n\nFigure 2\nPeru\u2019s Annual Inflation Rate 1993\u20131997\n(%)\n\nsources  of  funds,  such  as  from  Corporaci\u00f3n\nFinanciera  de  Desarrollo  (COFIDE),  a  second-\ntier,  state-owned  financial  institution.  The\nability to leverage funds in the debt market was\nalso limited. Nor could it access capital markets\nor mobilize public deposits legally. ACP wanted\nto  remove  these  hurdles.  For  this,  ACP  first\nexamined  the  feasibility  of  transforming  itself\nto a financiera, a regulated finance company for\nwhich  only  $3.0  million  was  required  as\nminimum  capital.  Then,  when  the  Peruvian\nBanking Superintendency created a new law in\n1994 to encourage transformation of NGOs into\nregulated financial institutions known as small\nbusiness  and  microenterprise  development\ninstitutions  (EDPYME),  ACP  studied  the\nfeasibility of transforming to an EDPYME. ACP\u2019s\nformal proposal on establishing an EDPYME was\napproved  by  the  Banking  Superintendency  in\nOctober  1996.6\n\nIn  the  meantime,  Peruvian  President\nFujimori,  in  a  public  address  in  July  1996,\nchallenged  the  Peruvian  formal  banks  to\nestablish  a  bank  dedicated  to  serve  micro-\nentrepreneurs. Later in the year, the Government\nestablished  a \ntechnical  committee  of\nmicrofinance experts to carry out a study on this\nissue.  The  Inter-American  Development  Bank\nprovided technical assistance to the Government\nfor  the  study.  In  February  1997,  when  the\nPresident attended the Micro Credit Summit in\nWashington D.C., he announced his commitment\nto create a microfinance bank in Peru (Campion\nand  White  1999,  p.  97).\n\nThe presidential committee was interested\nin  ACCION  International\u2019s  involvement  in  the\ninitiative.  ACCION  International  provided\ntechnical  assistance  to  the  committee  on  the\ncondition  that  the  new  bank  should  have  no\ngovernment ownership and would be owned 100%\nby the private sector. ACCION International and\nACP  jointly  submitted  a  concept  paper  to  the\npresidential  committee  to  transform  ACP  into  a\n\nSearch for a New Institutional Modality\n\nAlthough ACP grew rapidly, it needed access\nto more funds to sustain its rapid growth. Being\nan  NGO,  ACP  did  not  have  access  to  certain\n\n6 For an EDPYME, the minimum capital requirement was only $263,000. However, with this level of capital, EDPYME was\nnot  allowed  to  mobilize  any  deposits.  For  deposit  mobilization,  an  EDPYME  required  a  higher  level  of  capital,  a  good\nrating, and special approval from the Banking Superintendency.\n\nOperations of Acci\u00f3n Comunitaria del Per\u00fa 5\n\n\fnew  bank,  drawing  on  the  experience  of\ntransforming PRODEM (a microfinance NGO) in\nBolivia  into  BancoSol,  a  microfinance\ncommercial  bank.  ACP  also  carried  out  a\nfeasibility study on the intended transformation\n\nof  ACP  into  a  commercial  bank.  The  Banking\nSuperintendency  approved  this  study  in\nNovember  1997.  The  Government\u2019s  support\nexpedited the process of approval (Campion and\nWhite  1999,  p.  97\u201398).\n\n6\n\n\fIII. MIBANCO, THE MICROFINANCE\n\nCOMMERCIAL  BANK\n\nOwnership Structure and Transition\n\nOn 4 May 1998, Mibanco opened its doors\nto  the  public  as  a  microfinance  commercial\nbank.\n\nFive  investors  came  forward  with  a  total\ninitial equity capital of $14.0 million. ACP became\nthe  majority  owner,  with  60%  of  the  total  shares.\nThe other social investors were ProFund7 and  the\nACCION Gateway Fund.8 Two commercial banks,\nBanco Wiese Sudameris, and Banco de Credito del\nPer\u00fa, were the only private sector investors. This\ninitial ownership has undergone changes, as may\nbe seen from Table 5. In November 1999, the Andean\nDevelopment  Corporation  also  became  a\nshareholder.9 Banco de Credito del Per\u00fa sold its\nshares in November 2001. Banco Wiese has also\nsold its shares.  10\n\nAt  the  end  of  2002,  ACP  accounted  for\n66.35% of ownership of Mibanco while other social\ninvestors  (ProFund  and  ACCION  International)\naccounted for 24.19%.11 Private individuals were\nholding 3.1% (www.mibanco.com). Thus, Mibanco\nis still a bank owned largely by social investors.\nPerhaps  this  dominance  explains  why  it  has\nmanaged to remain largely within the boundaries\nof  its  original  social  mission  during  the  post-\ntransformation  period.  But  there  may  be  other\nfactors as well.\n\nTable 5\nMibanco  Ownership  Structure\n(%)\n\nOwners\n\nJune December\n1998\n\n 2002\n\nACP  (founder  NGO)\nProfundo\nAccion  Gateway  Fund\nBanco  Weise  Sudameris\nBanco  de  Credito  del  Per\u00fa\nAndean  Development  Corporation\nPrivate  Individuals\nMibanco\n\nTotal\n\n60.00\n19.68\n 7.00\n 6.66\n 6.66\n\n100\n\nSource: www.microrate.com; www.mibanco.com\n\n66.35\n17.81\n 6.38\n\u2013\n\u2013\n 3.82\n 3.10\n 2.54\n\n100\n\nThe year 1998 was obviously a transitional\nyear  for  Mibanco.  With  the  transformation,\nMibanco  agreed  to  administer  ACP\u2019s  loan\nportfolio at no cost for the first year and paid a\n$1.0 million premium in cash to ACP for access\nto  ACP\u2019s  client  base.  The  transition  of  clients\nfrom  ACP \u2019s  portfolio  to  Mibanco\u2019s  books,\nhowever, did not take long because the term of\nmost  of  ACP\u2019s  loans  was  less  than  5  months.\nMibanco  also  improved  its  operating  systems,\nprocedures,  and  governance  to  ensure\ncompliance  with  regulatory  requirements  and\nto  manage  its  growth  more  efficiently.\n\n7 ProFund is a for-profit investment fund. It provides equity and quasi-equity capital to MFIs to expand their operations on\na sustainable and large-scale basis.

As  shown  in  Table  8,  it  has  achieved\nimpressive  results  in  mobilizing  deposits.  Time\ndeposits  increased  six-fold  during  1999\u20132002,\nwhile  savings  deposits  increased  from  a  meager\n$44,000 in 1999 to $10.43 million by the end of\n2002. Total deposits at the end of 2002 amounted\nto $44.29 million, more than an eight-fold increase\nover  the  level  of  1999.  This  growth  led  to  an\nincrease in the deposit-to-loan ratio from 28% in\n1999  to  48%  in  2002,  deposit-to-total-liabilities\nratio  from  35%  to  54%,  and  deposit-to-total-\nliabilities-and-equity ratio from 18% to 42%. The\nfirst  quarter  2003  data  seem  to  suggest  a  more\nrobust deposit growth for 2003 than that achieved\nin 2002. Between the end of December 2002 and\nthe  end  of  March  2003,  time  deposits  increased\nby  33%,  savings  deposits  by  18.5%,  and  total\ndeposits by 24%. This has improved the deposit-\nto-loan ratio to 57%.\n\nWith these growth rates in both lending and\ndeposit operations, Mibanco stood as one of the\nflagship MFIs in the Latin American region at the\nend  of  2002,  as  may  be  seen  from  Table  9.  Very\nfew  regulated  MFIs  have  achieved  such  growth\nprofitably  within  such  short  periods  without\nrunning into quality and operational problems.\n\nScope of Operations\n\nThe growth of Mibanco could also be seen\nclearly  in  the  liabilities  segment  of  its  balance\n\nMibanco started with a single loan product\u2014\nworking-capital loans.

First,\nit expanded its menu of loan\nproducts. In 1999, the bank\nlaunched  two  new  loan\nproducts:  one \nthe\npurchase of fixed assets, and\nthe other for the expansion of\nmarket  stalls.  In  October  2000,  an  innovative\nhousing  loan  product  known  as  Micasa  (\u201cmy\nhome\u201d)  was  introduced  after  a  2-month  pilot\ntesting. In 2002, it introduced rural loans. Second,\nMibanco expanded its deposit services. It began\nto offer passbook savings in July 2000. In addition,\nit also provided time deposits and started to offer\nchecking accounts in 2002. Third, it began to offer\nmoney transfers and other financial services.\n\nfor \n\n(%)\n\nAt  the  end  of  2002,  Mibanco  had  28\nbranches\u201424  in  Lima  and  one  in  each  of  four\nprovinces. It is planning to expand this network\n\nto  35  branches  by  the  end  of  2003,  and  add\nautomated teller machines at each of its locations.\nThese  measures  have  not  only  improved\naccess to its services for an ever increasing number\nof  clients,  but  also  improved  the  quality  of  its\nservices.\n\nBreadth and Depth of Outreach\n\nMibanco has also experienced a remarkable\nimprovement in breadth of its outreach (Table 10).\nThe  number  of  active  borrowers  more  than\n\nTable 9\nMibanco\u2019s  Comparative  Position\n(as of 31 December 2002) a\n\nMFI\n\nCountry\n\nYear\n\nBolivia\nBancoSol\nBolivia\nCaja los Andes\nBolivia\nFIE FFP\nBolivia\nProdem  FFP\nEl  Salvador\nFinanciera  Calpia\nDominican  Republic\nBanco  Ademi\nColombia\nFinamerica\nPeru\nEDYFICAR\nMexico\nCompartamos\nPeru\nMibanco\na All data are for 2002, unless otherwise stated.\nb End of 2000.\nFFP = Fondo Financiera Privado.\n\n2001\n2000\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\nEquity\n($  million)\n  24.1b\n    5.8 b\n   4.4\n   4.9\n   8.5\n  15.3b\n  2.2\n  4.3\n 10.9\n 23.4\n\nActive\nLoan  Portfolio\n($  million)\n\nActive\nBorrowers\n(number)\n\nAverage  Active\nLoan  Balance\n($)\n\nTotal\n Assets\n($  million)\n\nTotal\nDeposits\n($  million)\n\n80.9\n64.6\n27.4\n24.7\n44.8\n50.5\n16.0\n20.0\n43.0\n92.3\n\n42,290\n51,229\n22,613\n26,000\n44,771\n16,408\n18,281\n20,975\n   144,991\n99,121\n\n1,913\n1,261\n1,217\n    950\n    998\n3,078\n   873\n   953\n   297\n   931\n\n96.3\n71.6\n29.2\n32.0\n57.4\n61.2\n\u2013\n21.6\n\u2013\n   105.0\n\n\u2013\n34.6\n11.0\n\u2013\n22.8\n16.4\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n44.3\n\nSources: Various web sites, mainly www.accion.org; www.bellanet.org; and www.imi-ag.de.\n\nMibanco, The Microfinance Commercial Bank 9\n\n\fTable 11\nMibanco\u2019s  Percentage  Distribution  of\nGross Loan Portfolio by Size of Loans\n(as of July 2001)\n\nSize  Category\n\nPercentage  of  Total  Portfolio\n\nLess than $250\n$250 \u2013 500\n$500 \u2013 750\n$750 \u2013 1,000\n$1,000 \u2013 1,500\n$1,500 \u2013 2,000\n$2,000 \u2013 4,000\nmore  than  $4,000\n\nTotal\n\n21\n30\n18\n 8\n12\n 3\n 6\n2\n\n100\n\nSource:  ACCION International (2002, p. 16)\n\nof the depth of outreach, also increased between\nthe same years from 16.7% to 46%.

On  the  deposit  side,  although  passbook\nsavings  accounts  were  introduced  only  in  July\n2000, there were about 84,000 passbook savings\naccounts by the end of 2001.\n\nAccording to Mibanco\u2019s mission statement,\nit  is  committed  \u201cto  continued  economic\ndevelopment  of  small  and  microenterprises\u201d\n(ACCION International, 2002, p. 11). Has it drifted\naway  from  this  mission  over  time?  What  is  the\ndepth of its outreach?13 Is Mibanco serving more\npoor  clients  now  than,  say,  in  1999?  We  have\nexamined  Mibanco\u2019s  poverty  outreach  from\ndifferent  angles,  and  all  seem  to  suggest  that\nMibanco  appears  to  have  deepened  its  poverty\noutreach in recent years.\n\nMibanco\u2019s  focus  on  the  lower  end  of  the\nmarket is shown by the size distribution of its loan\nportfolio (Table 11). At the end of July 2001, about\n21% of its loan portfolio was less than $250 while\n30%  was  in  the  $250\u2013500  category.  Also,\nmicroenterprise  loans  accounted  for  67%  of  the\ntotal number of loans at the end of 2002.\n\nThe nominal average active loan balance of\nMibanco increased by 148.3% from $375 in 1998\nto $931 in 2002 (Figure 3). The nominal average\nactive  loan  balance  as  a  percentage  of  GNP  per\ncapita, which is arguably a better proxy measure\n\n13 Depth in this paper refers to the level of poverty of the clients. Because of difficulties in direct measurement of depth,\nproxies are used for the purpose. The most common proxy is loan size. The other proxy measure is average active loan\nbalance as a percentage of GNP per capita. Schreiner (2002), who proposed an excellent framework of outreach, defines\ndepth of outreach in a more precise way.\n\n10\n\n\fseem to suggest a decline in Mibanco\u2019s depth of\noutreach. However, the inflation-adjusted average\nactive loan balances show a somewhat different\npicture. They increased by only 120% from $260\nto  $573  between  the  same  years.  This  tends  to\nsupport the assertion that Mibanco continues to\nserve the low end of the market.\n\nLoan sizes can increase not only because of\ninflation but also because of other factors including\n(i) improvement of lenders\u2019 information base on\nclients  over  time,  enabling  the  lender  to  make\nbigger  loans;  (ii)  organic  growth  of  clients\u2019\nactivities  that  makes  larger  loans  necessary  and\npossible; and (iii) a policy decision by a lender to\nmake larger loans, irrespective of the above factors\n(Gonzales-Vega et al. 1997, p.151\u2013152).\n\nMibanco appears to have pursued a business\nstrategy to expand its growth, and has moved itself\nup-market to some extent. At the same time, it has\nalso  been  able  to  provide  larger  loans  to  its\npreexisting  clients  because  the  bank  has  better\ninformation on which to assess the risks associated\nwith lending them larger amounts. Micasa loans,\nwith relatively large average loan sizes, have also\nbeen a factor responsible for the increase in overall\naverage  loan  size  in  2001\u20132002.  However,  it  is\npossible that an increasing number of its clients\nhave expanded their microbusinesses and stayed\nloyal to the bank in order to obtain progressively\nbigger  loans.  About  55%  and  57%  of  the  active\nborrowers  at  the  end  of  2001  and  2002,\nrespectively, were repeat clients. The bank has\nresponded  positively  to  these  repeat  clients.\nThus, it appears that the average loan size has\nincreased due to a combination of these factors,\nand  that  the  bank  has  not  taken  a  conscious\npolicy decision to move away from the low end\nof  the  market.  More  importantly,  Mibanco  has\nserved clients in the up-market without leaving\nits initial target group behind or at their expense.\nThe Micasa  housing  loan  product  is  also\nreaching poor clients partly because of its pro-\npoor  characteristics  (see  Box,  p.  12).\n\nAccording  to  ACCION  International,\n\u201cMibanco\u2019s  clients  are  market  vendors,\nseamstresses, bakers, pot-makers and others who\nsupport  their  families  by  starting  small,  often\nhome-based businesses. Many live in the pueblos\n\njoveness,  the  very  poor  shantytowns  on  the\noutskirts of Lima\u201d (see www.accion.org). ACCION\u2019s\npoverty  outreach  survey  in  2002,  based  on  data\non  clients  who  received  a  working  capital  loan\nbetween April 2001 and April 2002 from three of\nMibanco\u2019s 28 branches, threw more light on the\ndepth  of  outreach.  The  ACCION  researchers\ncompared the poverty rate of Mibanco clients with\nthat of a sample of Lima\u2019s population, using both\nthe  national  and  Lima  poverty  lines,  and  found\nthat  \u201cnearly  half  (49%)  of  Mibanco\u2019s  clients  are\nliving in poverty, compared with 40% of the Lima\npopulation  sample.  Twenty  seven  percent  of\nMibanco clients are also classified as poor based\non the lower national poverty line, compared with\nonly  22%  of  the  Lima  sample\u201d  (ACCION\nInternational 2003, p. 5). According to ACCION,\n\u201cthis finding tells a story that is consistent with\ninformal  observations:  a  small  percentage  of\nMibanco\u2019s clients have either very low or very high\nincome levels, suggesting that Mibanco is serving\nLima\u2019s poor and near-poor majority\u201d (Figure 4).\nApplying the distribution of clients in the\nsample survey across different poverty categories\n\nFigure 4\nDistribution  of  Mibanco\u2019s  Borrowers\nby  Poverty  Level\n\nMibanco, The Microfinance Commercial Bank 11\n\n\fto the total number of Mibanco\u2019s active borrowers\nat the end of 2002, ACCION researchers estimated\nthat  Mibanco  was  reaching  about  48,000  poor\nmicroentrepreneurs  and  their  households,\nincluding  6,900  with  incomes  less  than  50%  of\nLima\u2019s poverty line. Considering that Mibanco had\nonly 41,344 active borrowers at the end of 1999,\n\nit certainly served more poor clients in 2002 than\nin 1999, even if it is assumed that Mibanco was\nexclusively serving the poor in 1999.\n\nIt  is  essential  to  examine  deposit  services\nwhen discussing outreach. Poor and low-income\nhouseholds  use  Mibanco\u2019s  passbook  savings\nfacilities  extensively.  There  were  about  84,000\n\nMibanco\u2019s Pro-poor Housing Loan Product\n\nLima, the capital city of Peru, has some 8 million\npeople. About 82% of them live in poor households.\nMost of them do not have legal title to their property,\nbut over half or more of the poor households plan to\nimprove  or  expand  their  homes  every  year.  They,\nhowever, have little or no access to appropriate loans\nfor this purpose.\n\nMibanco, in its search for potential new growth\nareas  and  ways  to  better  serve  its  target  clients,\nidentified  this  market  and  developed  a  new  loan\nproduct, Micasa (\u201cmy home\u201d). The product was pilot\ntested  during  August-September  2000  in  two\nbranches, and launched in October 2000 throughout\nthe entire branch network. In less than 12 months,\n3,000  clients  were  served  with  a  portfolio  of  $2.6\nmillion. By end of September 2002, the total number\nof  active  clients  increased  to  6,954  and  the  active\nportfolio to $8.1 million, accounting for about 9% of\nthe total active loan portfolio of the bank. The product\nwas  generating  profits  for  the  bank.  With  Micasa,\nMibanco  is  reaching  a  poorer  set  of  clients  than  it\ndoes  with  its  microenterprise  loans.  Micasa  also\ndemonstrated  that  subsidized  interest  rates  are  not\nnecessary to support the housing strategies of the poor.\n\nMicasa has pro-poor features:\nThe product supports existing housing strategies\n(\u201cprogressive building\u201d) of poor and low-income\nhouseholds, such as converting wooden walls\nto brick and adding doors and windows.\nIt  is  offered  to  both  Mibanco\u2019s  traditional\nmicroenterprise  clients  and  low-income\nworkers living in the same communities. By\nadding the latter to its target group, the bank\nhas ended up serving poorer households.\nMicasa loans are secured, not with mortgages,\nbut  mainly  with  household  assets.  Taking  a\n\nSource: Adapted from ACCION International (2002).\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n12\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nmortgage increases transaction costs of both the\nbank and the clients and, thus, discourages poor\nhouseholds from using the product.\nLoans have longer maturity than microenterprise\nloans at a relatively lower interest rate than that\nof the latter. Although the maximum term is 36\nmonths, the majority opts for a shorter term. The\ninterest rates are approximately 4/5 the rate of\nmicroenterprise  loans.  The  interest  rates,\nhowever, do not include a subsidy, and are high\nenough  to  cover  the  full  cost.  These  rates  on\nloans  in  Peruvian  Soles  range  from  70%  per\nannum  for  loans  less  than  $860  to  50%  per\nannum for loans larger than $2,860.\nLoans are not tied to any technical assistance in\nthe planning, supervision, or implementation of\nthe  clients\u2019  construction  projects.  This  is\ncompatible  with  poor  households\u2019  strong\npreference to make their own design decisions.\nLoan applications for new clients typically take\nonly  3  days  from  the  time  the  application  is\nsubmitted  to  the  time  the  loan  is  disbursed.\nRepeat loans for the same purpose are processed\nin one day.\n\nThese  features  help  both  the  bank  and  the\nclients.  The  bank  can  expand  the  portfolio  rapidly\non  a  profitable  basis,  using  its  preexisting\ninfrastructure. Clients can obtain the loans with low\ntransaction costs to meet their demand and use them\nflexibly.  They  can  obtain  a  series  of  loans  if  the\nprevious loan has been fully repaid. Mibanco expects\nthat these loans will account for as much as 50% of\nthe bank\u2019s total portfolio within a few years. Whether\nsuch  high  portfolio  concentration  is  desirable,\nhowever, is highly questionable.\n\n\fsuch accounts in December 2001, indicating that,\non  the  deposit  side,  the  bank  has  expanded  its\ndepth of outreach significantly in recent years. As\nMibanco  gathers  more  experience  in  passbook\nsavings  mobilization,  this  service  is  likely  to\nexpand further in the future, and many more poor\nfamilies are likely to benefit from it.\n\nTime  deposits  continue  to  be  the  most\nimportant  source  of  Mibanco\u2019s  deposits,\naccounting for 74% of total deposits at the end of\nMarch 2003. The bulk of these deposits admittedly\ncomes  from  up-market  clients,  who  have  not\ndirectly contributed to the depth of its outreach.\nHowever,  this  is  an  important  strategy  of\nMibanco\u2014to  obtain  adequate  loanable  funds  to\nfinance  its  growing  lending  operations.  Using\ndeposits  of  rich  people  to  finance  lending\noperations  for  the  low  end  of  the  market  is  not\nonly good financial intermediation but also makes\nsense from a cost-efficiency point of view because\nadministrative  costs  of  large  deposits  are  much\nlower than those of small deposits. Also, this may\nbe justified from the point of view of diversification\nof the term structure of funding.\n\nReliance on Borrowings and Capital Markets\n\nTo finance its lending operations, Mibanco\nrelies  on  commercial  borrowings  in  addition  to\ndeposits. Loans from other financial institutions\naccounted for 54.5% of its total liabilities at the\nend of 1999, for 61.3% at the end of 2000, for 40.3%\nat  the  end  of  2001,  and  for  34.7%  at  the  end  of\n2002. This declined further to 32.4% by the end\nof March 2003.14 These lending institutions include\nboth  semicommercial  and  commercial  sources,\nand  national  as  well  as  international  financial\ninstitutions. It has borrowed from COFIDE15 and\n\nAgencia  para  la  Cooperaci\u00f3n  Internaci\u00f3nal  de\nEspa\u00f1a (Campion, et al., 2002, p. 183\u2013184). Banco\nde Credito del Per\u00fa also extended a $3.2 million,\n3-year loan with a 50% guarantee from ACCION\nInternational\u2019s Latin America Bridge Fund in October\n2001. In 2001, it also borrowed from Hivos-Triodos\nFund in The Netherlands. The International Finance\nCorporation (IFC) lent $5.0 million for a 5-year period\nin 2002. The long-term nature of IFC funding is\nexpected to improve Mibanco\u2019s capacity to expand\nmedium-term housing loans in particular, without\nrunning into risk of maturity mismatches between\nits  assets  and  liabilities.  It  has  also  borrowed\nrecently from Dexia Micro-Credit Fund.16\n\nIn December 2002, as part of its $30 million\nbond program to raise funds from capital markets,\nMibanco issued bonds for $6.0 million with a 50%\nguarantee  from  the  United  States  Agency  for\nInternational Development. Local pension funds\nbought 82% of the bonds. It is likely that Mibanco\nwill  go  to  capital  markets  in  the  future  without\nguarantees  from  external  parties  but  with  the\nbacking  of  its  financial  strength.17  Although\nborrowings increased in absolute terms and bond\nissue added a new source of funding, impressive\nperformance in deposit mobilization has caused\na structural change in Mibanco\u2019s liabilities, as may\nbe seen from Table 12.\n\nWith the rise in deposits and other liabilities\nduring the post-transformation period, Mibanco\u2019s\nleverage ratio increased from 1.05 in 1999 to 3.5\nin 2002, as shown in Figure 5. This rose further to\n3.62  by  the  end  of  March  200318  because  of  the\nsharp  increase  in  total  deposits  during  the  first\nquarter. However, the leverage ratio still remains\nlow  in  comparison  with  the  maximum  of  about\n10,  permitted  by  the  capital  adequacy\nrequirements for commercial banks. This indicates\n\n14 Author\u2019s computations based on balance sheet data.\n15 COFIDE was first created as a state development bank in Peru. It was converted to a strictly second-tier, apex funding\n\ninstitution in 1993. It began supporting microfinance institutions in 1994.\n\n16 The Dexia Micro-Credit Fund is one of the few funds dedicated to commercial financing of MFIs in the world. It has been\n\nincorporated in Luxembourg. For details, see www.blueorchard.ch.\n\n17 There is at least one precedent for this. The Financiera Compartamos, a leading MFI in Mexico, issued a $15.0 million\nbond in the Mexican capital market in 2002. This was backed fully by the Standard and Poors A+ rating (www.accion.org).\nHowever,  according  to  Jansson  (2002,  p.  10),  \u201cnot  all  microfinance  institutions  believe  bond  issuance  is  the  preferred\nstrategy. Caja Los Andes in Bolivia, for example, believes itself better served by expanding the amount and extending the\ntenure of term deposits. Term deposits require less up-front effort and can be tailored to each client.\u201d\n\n18 Author\u2019s calculations based on balance sheet data.\n\nMibanco, The Microfinance Commercial Bank 13\n\n\fTable 12\nMibanco: Evolution of the Structure of Liabilities\n(% of total liabilities)\n\nCategory\n\n1999 2000 2001 2002 2003\nEnd-\nMarch\n\nSavings  Deposits\nTerm  Deposits\nOther  Deposits\nLoans from Other\n\nFinancial  Institutions\n\nBonds\nOther  Liabilities\n\nTotal\n\n0.3\n33.1\n1.6\n\n54.5\n         0.0\n10.5\n\n4.7\n25.6\n1.3\n\n61.3\n0.0\n7.1\n\n7.6\n36.7\n2.8\n\n40.3\n0.0\n12.6\n\n12.8\n37.5\n4.0\n\n34.7\n7.0\n4.0\n\n13.3\n43.6\n2.0\n\n26.3\n6.2\n8.6\n\n100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0\n\nSource: Author\u2019s computations based on data from balance sheets of\n\nMibanco.\n\nthat Mibanco can comfortably increase its deposit\nand other liabilities further to harness the growth\npotential  in  the  market  for  a  few  more  years\nwithout fresh equity.\n\nPortfolio Quality\n\nHas  Mibanco  sacrificed  portfolio  quality\nto achieve high growth rates? Data indicate that\n\nFigure 5\nMibanco: Leverage Ratio a\n\nthis  has  not  been  the  case.  PAR  over  30  days\nincreased slightly in 2001 and 2002, as shown\nin Figure  6.  Perhaps  the  political  instability\nduring  2000  and  2001  that  resulted  in  a\ndownturn in the economy may have had some\neffect  on  this  deterioration.  But  the  PAR  still\nremained low at 2.84%, at the end of 2002. At\nthe end of March 2003, it was 2.81%. Given the\nrate  at  which  the  loan  portfolio  increased,\ncontaining  PAR  below  3%  can  even  be\nconsidered  an  impressive  achievement.\n\nEfficiency\n\nMibanco has grown to be a large financial\nintermediary  during  the  last  5  years,  as  shown\nearlier.  Its  loan  portfolio  exceeded  $100  million\nby  the  end  of  2002.  The  loan  portfolio-to-total-\nassets ratio increased from 80% in 1999 to 86% in\n2002,  and  the  number  of  active  borrowers\nincreased to almost 100,000. When compared to\nthe  averages  for  its  peer  group  of  MFIs,  \u201cLatin\nAmerica  large  broad  category,\u201d19  given  in  the\nMicroBanking Bulletin, Mibanco is the largest in\nsize and scale of operations. Yet, it is not as efficient\nas  its  peer  group.  Mibanco\u2019s  operating  expense\nratio for 2001 was 19.0% (Figure 7), while its peer\n\nFigure 6\nPortfolio  at  Risk\n\n19 With Mibanco, this group includes 11 MFIs: Banco Ademi, Banco Solidario Zenador, Banco del Desarrollo, BancoSol, Caja\n\nLos Andes, CM Arequipa, FIE, Finamerica, Prodem, and Solucion (The MIX 2002, p. 43).\n\n14\n\n\fgroup  average  was  only  15.5%  (The  MIX  2002,\np. 47).  This  is  a  serious  challenge  for  Mibanco\nparticularly  because  the  market  in  which  it\noperates is likely to become more competitive in\nthe medium term. Currently there is no intense\ncompetition for the bank in most of its operating\nareas. Perhaps this may explain its relatively low\nefficiency level as well as its strong profitability.\nHowever,  Mibanco\u2019s  management  is  aware  of\nthis  issue,  and  is  making  a  concerted  effort  to\naddress  it.\n\nThe Bottom Line: Profits and Profitability\n\nMibanco  reported  a  relatively  small  net\nincome of $223,000 for 1999, the first full year of\nits  operations.20  Thereafter,  its  net  income  grew\nrapidly. During 2000\u20132002, it increased  by  337%.\nAs shown in Table 13, the ROE also improved from\na  low  of  1.53%  in  1999  to  23.24%  in  2002.  The\nROA was 5.17% in 2002. Both the ROE and ROA in\n2002 were much higher than those reported for the\nbanking  sector  as  a  whole\u20148.43%  and  0.85%,\nrespectively.  Its  full-cost  pricing  policy  and  high\nbusiness  turnover  are  two  major  reasons  for  the\nprofitability.\n\nTable 13\nNet  Income  and  Profitability\n\n1999\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\nNet income after tax ($\u2018000)     223.00\nReturn on equity (%)a\nReturn on assets (%)a\n\n1.53\n\n0.75\n\n1,243.00\n\n3,180.00\n\n8.12\n\n2.77\n\n17.43\n\n  4.36\n\na Author\u2019s computations based on data in balance sheets and income statements.\n\nProspects for Mibanco\u2019s Future Outreach\n\nMibanco\u2019s  prospects  for  continued  rapid\nincrease  in  outreach  appear  good.  According  to\nsome  estimates,  Peru  has  more  than  6.8  million\n\nFigure 7\nMibanco  Operating  Expense  Ratio a\n\n2002\n\n2003\nEnd-\nMarch\n\nmicroenterprises, some 2.76 million of which are\nenterprises  with  1\u20135  workers.  The  share  of\nmicroenterprises with access to credit from MFIs\nis  less  than  5%  (Berger  et  al.  2003,  p.  9).  Their\ndemand for financial services continues to be vast.\nMFIs,  including  Mibanco,\nseem \nto  have  barely\nscratched  the  surface  of\ntheir market potential.21 The\nfor\nuntapped  market \nmicrofinancial  services\nremains  large.  This  is  true\nnot only for microcredit, but\nalso  for  savings  mobiliza-\ntion, local money transfers,\nremittance  and  payment\nand  micro -\nservices, \ninsurance. In this context, a dynamic institution\nlike Mibanco seems to have vast market potential\nfor  expanding  profitably  not  only  the  breadth\nbut also the depth and other dimensions of its\noutreach.\n\n5,433.00\n\n1,364\n\n23.24\n\n 5.17\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n20 Because it began operations in May 1998, making 1998 a transitional year, the figures for 1998 do not reflect a normal\n\nsituation. Hence, 1998 should not be considered a good year for comparison.\n\n21 Other suppliers include other commercial banks, finance companies, and municipal savings and credit banks, owned by\n\ncity governments and EDPYMEs.\n\nMibanco, The Microfinance Commercial Bank 15\n\n\f\fIV. LESSONS FOR ASIA\n\nM ibanco\u2019s  experience  offers  valuable\n\nlessons  for  microfinance  practitioners,\npolicymakers,  and  promoters,  particularly  for\nthose  interested  in  developing  the  microfinance\nindustry in Asia.\n\u2022\n\nLow-income segments of capital cities are a\nsignificant  source  of  demand  for  a  wide\nrange of financial services. This segment can\nbe served profitably. The relative neglect of\nthis market in most Asian countries means\nthat Asian MFIs currently concentrating only\nin rural areas are missing a good opportunity\nto serve the poor on an increasing scale, with\nprofits. This, however, does not mean that\ntheir  rural  operational  modalities  can  be\nsimply extended to service urban areas.\nGovernments  do  not  have  to  own  MFIs  to\nensure  financial  services  for  the  poor  and\nlow-income  households  and \ntheir\nmicroenterprises.  Peruvian  President\nFujimori\u2019s Government was first keen to have\nan  ownership  stake  in  a  dedicated\nmicrofinance bank, but changed its position\nlater, based on sound and strong technical\nadvice \nin  ACCION\nInternational and other organizations. If the\nGovernment insisted on a stake in ownership\nfor itself, Mibanco perhaps would not have\ncome into being, at least as quickly as it did.\nA delayed transformation of ACP would have\nmade  many  poor  and \nlow-income\nhouseholds worse-off.\nGovernments  can  encourage  private\nownership and solutions in many ways. For\nexample, Mibanco was able to increase its\nMicasa loans partly because of a 5-year loan\nextended by the state-owned COFIDE. The\nGovernment,  however,  did  not  dictate  the\ninterest rates and other terms and conditions\nunder which these funds should be relent\n\nfrom  experts \n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nby Mibanco. Nor did it attempt to target the\nfunds at a particular segment of the market\nto achieve its own development objectives\nor  priorities.  By  staying  away  from  both\nmicromanagement  and  inappropriate\ninterventions,  the  Government  allowed\nMibanco to develop a sustainable housing\nloan program for the poor and low-income\nhouseholds,  and  created  strong  incentives\nfor  Mibanco  to  expand  this  operation.\nThrough  this  course  of  action,  the\nGovernment  indirectly  helped  many  poor\nclients and potential clients.\nWhen MFIs establish partnerships with well-\nestablished and strong providers of technical\nservice, rapid growth is easier than otherwise\nwould be the case. ACP\u2019s strong partnership\nwith  ACCION  International  was  a  crucial\nfactor  in  its  sustained  growth.22  Similarly,\nthe partnership  between  Mibanco  and\nACCION International ensured a reliable\nsource of technical advice when needed.\nMFIs  can  deepen  their  poverty  outreach  a\ngreat  deal  without  expensive  and\ncumbersome targeting mechanisms if they\ndevelop demand-driven, pro-poor products\ninstead  of  merely  offering  products\ndeveloped  by  others \nfor  different\nenvironments. Some new products can be\nintroduced  with  small  incremental\ninvestments  within  the  existing  branch\nnetwork  and  lending  infrastructure,  while\nsome others may need larger investments.\nTransforming NGOs into regulated financial\ninstitutions  does  not  necessarily  lead  to  a\nmission drift. Although average loan sizes\ntend  to  increase  after  transformation  for\nvarious reasons, transformed entities could\ncontinue to serve an increasing number of\noriginal target clients while diversifying their\nclient  base.  Moreover,  with  new  pro-poor\n\n22 However, there are MFIs in Latin America and Asia that have grown rapidly without such technical partners. A case in\npoint is Fondo Financiera Privado FIE in Bolivia. The Association for Social Advancement (better known by its acronym\nASA) in Bangladesh also did not rely on external technical assistance for its growth. Both institutions are profitable.\n\nLessons for Asia 17\n\n\fproducts,  it  is  possible  to  deepen  their\noutreach.  This  is  an  important  lesson  for\nthose matured microfinance NGOs in Asia,\nwhich, at least for now, do not seem to have\na  strong  interest  in  becoming  regulated\nfinancial institutions because of perceived\npotential loss of their social mission. While\nadopting  a  business  approach  within  the\nconstraints of their social mission is not an\neasy task for MFIs, there are effective ways\nof  approaching  this  issue,  as  shown  by\nMibanco.\nExtending  financial  liberalization  to  an\nextent that would allow international social\n\n\u2022\n\ninvestors and local and international private\ninvestors  to  make  equity  investments  is\nlikely  to  produce  beneficial  effects  on  the\ndevelopment of the microfinance industry\nin the medium to long term. This, in turn,\nwould  enhance  the  welfare  of  poor\nhouseholds  that  otherwise  have  to  forego\nproductive investments, save in nonfinan-\ncial assets, and suffer from greater volatility\nof income and consumption. They may have\nto  turn  to  informal  commercial  financial\nmarkets  where  they  have  to  pay  a  high\n\u201cpoverty  premium\u201d  for  financial  products\nand  services.\n\n18\n\n\fV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nT he  case  of  Mibanco  tells  a  compelling\n\nsuccess story and illustrates that matured, well-\nfunctioning  microfinance  NGOs  can  be\nsuccessfully transformed into regulated financial\nentities, provided that there is a supportive legal\nframework  for  such  transformation.  And  after\ntransformation, they can be expected to continue\nto serve the poor and low-income households and\ntheir microenterprises better, on a larger scale, and\nprofitably.  There  are  other  success  stories  that\n\nsupport  this  conclusion.  Governments  in  Asia\nand funding agencies interested in developing\na  sustainable  microfinance  industry  in  Asia\nneed, among other things, to take more interest\nin  creating  preconditions  for  successful\ntransformation and providing critical assistance\nfor  transformation.  NGOs  have  to  play  a\nproactive role to improve themselves and make\ntheir institutions both suitable and attractive for\ntransformation.\n\nConclusions 19\n\n\fREFERENCES\n\nACCION International. 2002.
