ACCION\nhas been supporting a network of microfinance institutions throughout Latin America. It recently started operations in\nthe African region. For details, see www.accion.org.\n3 ACP started as a multiservice organization working in such areas of development as health, education, training, and\ncredit. But it soon realized that it had to choose one area and focus on that to have a significant development impact.\n4 For example, ASA had 1.976 million active borrowers at the end of 2002, with an outstanding gross loan portfolio of about\n$159 million. BRAC disbursed $294 million in microloans during 2002. Unit Desas had 27.6 million deposit accounts and\n2.65 million loan accounts at the end of 2001.\nIntroduction 1", "", "II.
