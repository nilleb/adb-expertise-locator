BACKGROUND \nSince  the  early  1990s,  international  production  networks  have  developed  within  the \nAssociation of Southeast Nations (ASEAN) and East Asia. Extensive production networking \nand the regional division of labor have resulted in massive vertical intra-industry trade in \nparts  and  components  within  the  region,  effectively  becoming  the  de  facto  economic \nintegration in East Asia. Figure 1 shows the share of intra-regional trade (exports and \nimports) within several economic areas. The share of intra-East Asia trade, where East Asia \nis defined as the 10 ASEAN countries, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Japan, Hong \nKong, China, and the Republic of Korea (hereafter Korea), rose remarkably from 34.9% in \n1980 to 52.4% in 2003. Surprisingly, this figure is higher than that of the North American \nFree Trade (NAFTA) area, which stands at 44.6%, though a bit lower than 58.7% of the \nEuropean Union (EU). East Asia has no doubt achieved a high level of de facto economic \nintegration in terms of international trade transactions within the region. The integration \nprocess has not been seriously interrupted, not even by the Asian currency crisis that \noccurred in the late 1990s. \nHowever, economic integration in East Asia does not seem to have developed in an even \nmanner. The share of intra-regional trade of the ASEAN 10 and PRC-Japan-Korea in 2003 \nremains at only 22.2% and 25.8% respectively, against that of East Asia as a whole (52.4%). \nThis suggests that economic activity requires a large space in which to expand, such as the \nwhole of East Asia, as spatial economists argue. Figure 2 shows trade shares of East Asia \nby partner countries or regions. Such a trend suggests that countries at relatively low-income \nlevels have played a significant role in the expansion of the intra-regional trade in East Asia. \nThe trade pattern inside East Asia has changed, from a traditional pattern in which capital \ngoods and final products, such as consumer and intermediate goods, have been traded with \neach other to a pattern where parts and components are traded instead. To put it differently, \nintermediate  goods  in  the  same  industry  have  been  actively  traded  among  the  Asian \ncountries, expanding intra-industry and intra-regional trade. For instance, import shares of \nparts and components within East Asia increased from 7.2% in 1980 to 32.2% in 2003, while \nthose of processed goods decreased from 37.3% to 28.0% in those same years. Parts and \ncomponents as shares of trade have become the largest among commodity groups (see \nFigure 3). \nEast Asia is experiencing an explosive increase in trade in intermediate goods, particularly in \nmachinery industries, based on the international division of labor and production processes \namong countries at different income levels and development stages. Trade patterns, in \ntoday's global competition where economies of scale are a strong consideration, are quite \ndifferent from the traditional ones based on the static concept of comparative advantage. \nThe whole production process now involves sequential production blocks that are located \nacross countries. Different stages of production are undertaken by different suppliers located \nin different countries. Products traded between firms in different countries are components \ninstead of final products.  \nThis phenomenon is known as cross-border production sharing or the fragmentation of \nproduction. Production processes are finely sliced into many stages and located in different \ncountries in East Asia. In theory, with such vertical specialization a slight decline in trade \ncosts would induce an increase in the trade of intermediate goods since goods may move \nacross national borders multiple times. For example, an intermediate good is exported from \ncountry A to country B and is imported back to country A again after processing in country B. \nIn this case, the good crosses a national border twice in country A and twice in country B. \nThis is what actually happens in East Asia; when trade cost goes down, the competitiveness \nof the whole of East Asia increases greatly. \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 231    Lim and Kimura \n \nFigure 1: Intra-Regional Trade (Export and Import) Ratio (%) \n30\nNAFTA\n25\n20\nEU15\n15\nJapan\n10\nASEAN10 PRC\n5\nKorea\n0\n1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005\n  \n \nSource: IMF 2004. \nFigure 2: Trade Share of East Asia with Partner Country (%) \n(%)\n70\nEU15\n60\n58.2\n50\nNAFTA\n43.1\n40 42.1\nEast Asia\n30\n25.8\nASEAN10\n23.2\n20\nPRC-Japan-Korea\n10\n0\n1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005\n \nNote: East Asia consists of ASEAN, PRC, Japan, Hong Kong, China, Korea, and Taipei,China.  \nSource: IMF 2004. \n2 ", "ADBI Working Paper 231    Lim and Kimura \n \nFigure 3: Trade Pattern Inside East Asia (%) \n(%)\n50\nPrimary goods\nProcessed goods\nParts and components\n40 Capital goods\nProcessed goods Consumption goods\nManufactured goods\n30\nParts and components\nPrimary goods\n27.7%\n20\nConsumption goods\nCapital goods\n10\n6.0%\n0\n1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004\n \nNote: The values of traded goods are measured by import value in terms of US dollars. \nSource: Institute of Developing Economies (IDE) 2006.  \n3 ", "ADBI Working Paper 231    Lim and Kimura \n \n \nFigure 4: Production Network in East Asia \n \nPRC  US \nPCBA \nCarriage \nHGA  Japan \nBase  Cover  \nHead  Disk \nSuspensio Screw \nSpindle  n  Ramp \nMotor  Top Clamp \nBase  Taipei,China  Latch  \nCarriage      Plate Case \nFlex Cable  Filter \nPivot  Thailand  Hong Kong, China  PCBA \nSeal        Suspension \nVCM   \nTop Cover \nPCBA \nHGA  Philippines \n  Damping \nBa se  Malaysia  Plate \nPivot    Coil Support \nSpacer   \nVCM \nBase  Indonesia \nCard  Singapor Suspensio\nTop  e  n \nClamp  Cover  VCM \n  Screw   \nPivot \nPCADP \n \n \nSource: Hiratsuka 2006. \n2.  THE MECHANICS OF INTERNATIONAL PRODUCTION \nNETWORKS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF SMES \nAlthough international production and distribution networks in East Asia began to form since \nthe beginning of the 1990s, Jones and Kierzkowski (1990) began developing the theory of \nfragmentation  around  the  same  time.  The  theory  pointed  out  fundamental  differences \nbetween  the  division  of  labor for  industry  and  production-processes, or rather  between \nfinished products trade and intermediate goods trade, particularly within the context of the \nfirm\u2019s decision making in cutting out production blocks and service link costs. \n4 ", "ADBI Working Paper 231    Lim and Kimura \n \nFigure 5: The Theory of Fragmentation \nBefore Fragmentation \nPB  PB  PB  PB \nPB \nLarge Integrated Factory \n \nAfter Fragmentation \nPB \nSL \nPB  PB \nSL      SL \nPB  PB \n \nPB \n  SL \nSL \nPB: production blocks \nSL: service links \n \nSource: Fukunari 2006 \nFigure 5 illustrates the original idea of fragmentation. Suppose that a large factory in the \nmachinery industry takes care of all production processes from upstream to downstream. \nSuch a factory is both capital and human-capital intensive and as such is likely to be located \nin a developed country. However, if we look at the factory in detail, we may find various \nproduction processes. Some processes are human-capital intensive and require a pool of \nresearchers and technicians. On the other hand, some processes are highly labor-intensive \nand a pool of unskilled labor may suffice. Other processes may need to operate 24-hours \nper day in order to accelerate capital depreciation. Hence, if we can fragment production \nprocesses into several production blocks and locate them in appropriate places that possess \ndifferent  location  advantages,  we  may  save  on  the  total  production  cost.  This  is \nfragmentation. \nFragmentation of production processes makes sense when the savings of production costs \nin production blocks is large and incurred service link costs for connecting remotely located \nproduction blocks are small. Firms can cut out production blocks so as to exploit differences \nin location advantages in remote areas. However, service link costs, including transport \ncosts  and  various  coordination  costs,  should  not  be  too  large.  Transactions  between \nproduction blocks tend to be relation-specific in a production process. \nThe international production and distribution networks in East Asia have reached a high level \nof sophistication in that fragmentation and agglomeration occur at the same time, developing \nthe  complicated  combination  of  intra-firm  and  inter-firm  transactions.  To  analyze  the \nsophistication of production and distribution networks in East Asia, Kimura and Ando (2005) \nintroduced  fragmentation  in  terms  of  the  firm\u2019s  disintegration.  They  also  included  a \n5 ", "ADBI Working Paper 231    Lim and Kimura \n \ndimension of fragmentation in terms of geographical distance, where a firm decides whether \nto keep some economic activities inside the firm or to outsource them to unrelated firms (see \nFigure  6).  This  two-dimensional  framework  explains  the  sophisticated  nature  of \nfragmentation in East Asia, where fragmentation of both intra-firm and inter-firm production \nprocesses is developed.  \nFigure 6: Fragmentation in a Two-Dimensional Space \nDisintegration \nSpot Market Bidding  Internet Auction \nDomestic/inter-firm  Cross-border/inter-firm \nfragmentation  EMS  fragmentation \nOEM \nSubcontractin  \ng  Outsourcing \n(Boundary  \nof firm) \nDomestic/intra-firm  Cross-border/intra-firm \nfragmentation  fragmentation \nOriginal Position  (National border)  Distance \n  \nSource: Kimura and Ando 2005. \nBy  introducing  the  idea  of  intimacy  between  geographical  proximity  and  inter-firm \ntransactions, the framework can explain the simultaneous development of the firm-level \nfragmentation of production processes and the industry-level formation of agglomeration. \nInter-firm transactions are accompanied by extra transaction costs as compared to intra-firm \ntransactions,  which  here  are  interpreted  as  service  link  costs  in  disintegration-type \nfragmentation. Such costs may be particularly high when a firm does not perfectly trust its \ncounterpart. Short distances help such transactions by cutting down the cost of identifying \nand monitoring business partners as well as the cost of trouble-shooting. Such forces in turn \nformulate  industrial  agglomeration  in  East  Asia.  At  such  a  sophisticated  stage  of \ndevelopment of the formation of production networks, SMEs play a crucial role. SMEs are \nessential components of production networks, involved in inter-firm fragmentation in various \nforms such as subcontracting arrangements and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) \ncontracts. SMEs are also essential components for industrial agglomeration. In this context, \nlocal SMEs as well as multinational SMEs can be important participants in the vertical inter-\nfirm division of labor. \nIn  ASEAN  and  East  Asia,  international  trade  in  parts  and  components  has  expanded \nexplosively, and the international division of labor in terms of production processes has \ndeveloped to an unprecedented degree. At the same time, economic agglomeration or \nindustrial clusters have grown in several notable places where dense vertical supply chains \nhave formed. The fragmentation of production processes and the formation of economic \nagglomeration, however, are rather new phenomena starting from the late 1980s or the early \n1990s. The new economic geography and fragmentation theory are extremely useful in \nunderstanding the mechanisms of agglomeration and fragmentation. \nThe  new  economic  geography  explains  the  formation  of  economic  agglomeration  in \ngeographical space. The spatial structure of economic activities is considered to be the \noutcome of a process involving two opposing types of forces\u2014agglomeration forces and \n6 ", "ADBI Working Paper 231    Lim and Kimura \n \ndispersion forces. The geographical theory analyzes the balance of these two opposing \nforces that generate a variety of location patterns of economic activities.  \nA key property of agglomeration forces is the circular causality of economic activities. For \nexample, an automobile assembler would attract a number of upstream suppliers, and the \nresulting productivity enhancement and market expansion might lead to the entry of another \nassembler. Such circular causality would generate a sort of economies of scale through \ngeographical proximity.. \nAt the same time, the growth of economic agglomeration would enhance dispersion forces. \nConcentration  of  economic  activities  would  increase  land  prices  and  wage  rates,  bring \nsevere  price  competition  among  firms,  cause  traffic  congestion,  complicate \ntelecommunication, and generate air pollution. Due to such congestion effects, dispersion \nforces would be intensified.  \nOne of the important factors that affect the balance between agglomeration forces and \ndispersion forces is transport cost, which includes freight costs, tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and \nrisk for exchange-rate variation. As transport costs decrease, agglomeration may grow. With \na substantial decrease in transport cost, production activity may disperse instead.  \nThere are three elements that make fragmentation possible. First, there must be production \ncost saving in fragmented production blocks\u2014the firm must take advantage of differences in \nlocation advantages between the original location and a new location. Second, the cost of \nservice links that connect remotely located production blocks, like the costs of transportation, \nmust not be too high. Third, the cost of network set-ups must be small. When the additional \ncost for setting up a new plant is relatively small, the production process fragments easily. \nThe feasibility of fragmentation, therefore, depends heavily on the nature of technologies in \nthe industry and economic environment. New economic geography and the fragmentation \ntheory provide insights to important factors that determine the location of economic activities \nin the globalizing era. \nInternational production and distribution networks in ASEAN and East Asia are, relatively \nspeaking,  the  most  advanced  and  sophisticated  in  the  world.  East  Asia  has  no  doubt \ndeveloped a favorable policy environment that is suitable for globalizing corporate activities. \nHowever,  such  a  policy  environment  has  been  realized  through  accumulated  profit-\nmotivation actions by the private sector rather than being developed with well-designed \nstrategic moves. \nNew economic geography and the fragmentation theory provide rich implications for policy \nenvironments in the globalizing era. New economic geography suggests a promulgation of \npolicies that affect agglomeration forces and dispersion forces. The fragmentation theory \nsuggests policies affecting production cost saving, service link cost, and network-set-up cost. \nCombined with careful consideration of policy needs that differ by development stages, it is \npossible to develop desirable policy packages in order to utilize globalizing forces. \n3.  THE LINK WITH TECHNOLOGY TRANSFERS AND \nSPILLOVERS \nInternational  production  and  distribution  networks  provide  various  opportunities  for \nmultinational enterprises (MNEs) and local firms in developing countries to compete and \ncooperate with each other. Such interactions between MNEs and local firms are much more \nvaried and intense than in a world with relatively simple North-South industrial divisions of \nlabor. This implies that the nature of technology transfers and spillovers has evolved in the \nenhanced economic dynamism. \nIn comparison with the relocation of whole operations to least developed countries (LDCs), a \nMNE has a greater degree of freedom in how to cut out production blocks, which in turn \n7 ", "ADBI Working Paper 231    Lim and Kimura \n \nyields greater flexibility in the location pattern. This means that a MNE can relocate some \nactivities to LDCs with much smaller-commitments than in the case of relocating all activities. \nThe consequence is that some production processes actually move to LDCs with technology \nadvantages. From the viewpoint of hosting LDCs, such transfers require less policy than in \nthe case of the relocation of the entire industry in the form of import-substituting foreign \ndirect investment (FDI).  \nThe physical movement of technology and managerial know-how to LDCs would provide \nmore  opportunities  for  local  firms  and  entrepreneurs  to  enjoy  technology  transfers  or \nspillovers. However, there is a potential difficulty that comes with these slices of value \nchains. Particularly at the early stage of development, fragmented production blocks do not \ntypically engage in transactions with neighboring firms, which limits the linkage channel of \ntechnology transfers and spillovers to a particular firm. In addition, technology absorptive \ncapacity is one of the crucial determinants for what sort of production processes will be \nlocated in LDCs, whether vertical linkage is developed, and whether technological spillovers \noccur.  LDCs  at  the  initial  stage  of  industrialization  typically  suffer  from  low  technology \nabsorptive capacity.  \nOnce  LDCs  reach  the  stage  of  industrial  agglomeration,  the  perspective  of  technology \ntransfers and spillovers is drastically improved. In industrial agglomeration, vertical division \nof labor by means of inter-firm transactions is actively conducted. Initially, such transactions \ntend to be among upstream and downstream MNEs. However, under severe competitive \npressure,  MNEs  start  seeking  local  firms  to  transfer  technologies  to  local  firms  and \nentrepreneurs in order to obtain a supply of parts and components at satisfactory prices, \nquality, and delivery timing. Technology absorptive capacity of local firms and entrepreneurs \nagain becomes an important determinant of the extent of technology transfers and spillovers. \nA  key  difference  from  traditional  import  substitution  with  heavy  trade  protection  is  the \ncompetitive pressure from international markets, which forces efficiency in MNE operations.  \nThe  spatial  structure  of  production  networks  provides  an  important  geographical \nconsideration  regarding  technology  transfers  and  spillovers.  At  least  in  the  case  of \nmachinery industries with major just-in-time systems, inter-firm transactions almost always \noccur in geographical proximity. When a novice local firm enters international production \nnetworks,  it  most  often  occurs  as  a  first  layer  transaction.  This  coincides  with  the \ngeographical  extent  to  which  human  resources  can  travel  daily.  Cross-border  inter-firm \ntransactions by local firms, such as transactions at the second or third layer of production, \nare rare except in cases where the firm has already established a strong reputation. Layer of \nproduction refers to different stages or phases of production. \nIn  industries  other  than  machinery,  some  adjustments  are  necessary.  In  the  garment \nindustry, for example, the speed and frequency of transactions are typically slower that in the \nmachinery industry, and thus longer distance transactions between MNEs and local firms \nmay be possible. In the software industry, the geographical distance in transactions may be \nless important, although credibility remains important. In both cases, technological links with \nMNEs are crucial to the quality of work.  \n3.1  New Development Strategies and Technology Transfers and \nSpillovers \nThe formation of international production and distribution networks in East Asia induces a \nfundamental revision of development strategies for LDCs. New development strategies claim \nthat  participation  in  international  production  and  distribution  networks  is  the  key  to \naccelerating economic development in an era of globalization.  \nThe development of international production and distribution networks in East Asia also \npresents a new perspective on technology transfers and spillovers. Hosting FDI generates \nboth positive and negative effects on local firms and entrepreneurs. Negative effects stem \n8 ", "ADBI Working Paper 231    Lim and Kimura \n \nfrom  enhanced  competition  in  local  markets  for  products  and  labor,  and  technological \ndominance by MNEs may adversely affect the performance of local firms. On the other hand, \npositive effects include easier access to technology and managerial know-how for local firms \nand entrepreneurs. Technology transfers or spillovers may occur in the form of imitation or \nreverse technology, spin-off of engineers, and most notably vertical links to upstream and \ndownstream MNEs.  \nA  traditional  development  strategy  known  as  import-substituting  FDI  seeks  to  establish \nvertical  links  between  local  firms  and  MNEs,  and  leverages  those  links  to  explore  the \npossibility of technologically upgrading local firms and entrepreneurs. Such attempts often \nfail because the size of the local market is small and compensating incentives for MNEs \nsuch  as  import  restrictions  degrade  the  competitive  environment.  Under  discretionary \nincentive schemes, MNEs typically have a weak incentive to make technology transfers to \nlocal firms and entrepreneurs.  \nAnother  development  strategy  that  utilizes  export-oriented  FDI  and  does  not  provide  a \nnotable increase in technology transfers and spillovers insofar as the activities of MNEs are \ngeographically segregated in narrow export processing zones (EPZs). MNEs in EPZs are \nexposed to international competition and pursue maximum efficiency. In this situation, the \nvalue-added  slices  that  MNEs  bring  in  are  often  very  thin  and  limited  to  purely  labor-\nintensive  activities,  and  the  enclave  nature  of  EPZs  becomes  a  serious  obstacle  to \ntechnology transfers and spillovers.  \nThe concept of four layers of transactions has a profound implication in the context of East \nAsia. Developing countries at the early phase of economic development try to participate in \ninternational production networks by hosting production blocks pushed out of congested \nindustrial agglomeration in the neighborhood. During this phase, transactions by invited \nproduction blocks occur mostly in the second layer. However, developing countries that have \nreached a higher phase of economic development should try to formulate efficient industrial \nagglomeration. In this phase, transactions in the first layer become important. Alternatively, \nin the context of developing economies outside East Asia, long distance transactions such \nas those in the third layer become important. The types of expected transactions require \ndifferent policies, and have different demands for hard and soft infrastructure. \nInternational production and distribution networks, particularly at the stage of development \nobserved in the East Asia today, present a possibility for technology transfers and spillovers. \nEast Asia proves that the sophistication of production fragmentation can achieve the level of \nindustrial  agglomeration  in  which  active  technology  spillovers  may  occur.  In  an \ninternationally  competitive  environment,  some  MNEs  are  quite  willing  to  transfer \ntechnologies. This is a new way of pursuing technology transfers and spillovers.  \nOne problem is that not all countries can immediately attain such a stage of development. In \norder to participate in international production and distribution networks, a country must host \nthe first wave of production blocks invested by MNEs. At this stage, the operation tends to \nbe thin in value-added processes, perhaps even thinner than in the case of traditional EPZ \noperations,  and  local  vertical  links  are  not  yet  established.  This  means  that  significant \ntechnology  transfers  or  spillovers  may  not  be  expected  for  a  while  if  the  technology \nabsorptive capacity of the industry is not well developed. Policymakers in LDCs must be \npatient  in  hosting  FDI  until  a  critical  mass  is  built  up,  rather  than  hastily  introducing \nperformance  requirements  for  technology  transfers.  Once  the  seed  of  industrial \nagglomeration has been planted, local firms and entrepreneurs will have ample opportunities \nfor penetrating production networks, which will eventually accelerate technology transfers \nand spillovers.  \nAlthough these arguments require further theoretical elaboration and empirical support, they \nseem to be largely consistent with the literature on technology spillovers, such as Lim \n(2007). The literature in particular suggests that vertical input-output linkages between local \n9 ", "ADBI Working Paper 231    Lim and Kimura \n \nfirms and MNEs are the most powerful channel to accelerate technology transfers and \nspillovers. \n4.  THE INTERNATIONALIZATION OF SMES IN REGIONAL \nAND GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS \nCurrent State of SMEs in Southeast Asia \nBefore exploring what policies can facilitate the internationalization of SMEs in Southeast \nAsia, it is useful to first examine the sector\u2019s characteristics to get a sense of the present and \npotential capabilities, as well as the constraints that are present. This, however, is a tricky \ntask given the following factors: 1) a lack of timely and comprehensive information about \nSMEs due to a structural weakness in statistical service in many developing countries, 2) the \nwide differences in economic structures and levels of development in the region, and 3) \ndifferences in countries\u2019 definitions of SMEs. \nRoles and Characteristics \nWith its massive size, the SME sector forms the backbone of Southeast Asia\u2019s economy. It \naccounts for a majority (more than 90%) of the number of all private-sector firms (Asasen, \nAsasen, and Chuangcham 2003) and employs a considerable proportion of the domestic \nworkforce in each country (40\u201390%). Thus, it is not surprising that Southeast Asia\u2019s SMEs \nplay a significant economic role, albeit to varying extents (see Table 2). They make a \nsubstantial contribution to employment (about 40\u201390%) and exports (more than 25%), and \nplay different dynamic roles that drive economic growth and industrial development (Wengel \nand Rodriguez 2006). For example, SMEs in Singapore provide a flexible skilled production \nbase that attracts MNEs; while in Viet Nam SMEs and rural enterprises were instrumental in \nthe transition process from a planned to market economy. \nSoutheast Asia\u2019s SMEs pervade virtually all socio-economic activities and services across \nurban and rural-urban areas. But there is much variation in their sectoral composition. While \nSMEs have an overwhelming presence in the Malaysian service sector, they are strongly \nrepresented in agriculture in Indonesia, food, beverage, and tobacco in Cambodia, and \nwholesale and retail trade in the Philippines (Table 2). \nGiven the trends of rising globalization and economic integration in the Asian region, there is \nsignificant  potential  for  the  SME  sector  to  increase  its  contribution  to  the  region\u2019s \ndevelopment  through  greater  participation  in  global  value  chains  (GVCs).  There  are, \nhowever, some characteristics that are generally shared among SMEs in Southeast Asia \nthat limit their ability to do so. \nEntrepreneurism \nThere  is  a  shortage  of  a  sustainable  entrepreneurial  drive  in  the  sector.  This  can  be \nattributed to a weak culture of innovation, and in the high growth Asian economies an over-\nreliance on technologies brought in by MNCs. Entrepreneurship capabilities are crucial for \nSMEs to maximize their inherent comparative advantages gained from operating on a small \nscale, such as the flexibility to adapt to changing market demands. \nLevel of Expertise \nThe  SME  sector\u2019s  development  is  also  constrained  by  a  lack  of  skill  and  expertise  in \norganization and management, which are important for enterprises\u2019 efficiency, flexibility, and \ncompetitiveness  (Asasen,  Asasen,  and  Chuangcham  2003).  The  need  for  competent, \ncontemporary  management  is  compounded  by  the  fact  that  drastic  economic  and \ntechnological developments have created new, modern ways of production and service \ndelivery.  \n10 ", "ADBI Working Paper 231    Lim and Kimura \n \nRelated to this issue is information communication technology (ICT) capability. Although \nthere have been no comprehensive studies done on the extent of adoption of ICT in the \nSME sector in Southeast Asia, preliminary data suggest that a huge number of SMEs in \nSoutheast Asia have yet to establish an online presence and networking facilities (Asasen, \nAsasen, and Chuangcham 2003). This can be partly attributed to a lack of awareness and \nknow-how and limited access to ICT infrastructure, hardware, and software. \nNetworking \nThere has been minimal clustering and network forming among SMEs, activities that, as \nmany scholars agree, can help small firms overcome some of the barriers they commonly \nface, such as difficult access to information, markets, and inputs (Giuliani, Pietrobelli, and \nRaboletti 2005). This may be due to an inward-looking mentality that is typical among the \nfamily enterprises that account for a large proportion of the sector. To illustrate, more than \n90% of SMEs in Cambodia are single proprietorship businesses, owned by an individual or \nfamily (Baily 2007). In Malaysia, micro-establishments represent 79.4% of SMEs (Normah \n2006). Linkages also require fundamental shifts in business strategies that SMEs may not be \nable to achieve because of a lack of resources and knowledge. \nAccess to Finance \nSMEs in most Southeast Asian economies have been having difficulty gaining access to \nfinance for a long time. This can be attributed to imperfections in the financial markets and a \nlack of critical primary and secondary markets such as those for SME equity and bond \nfinancing.  The  formal  banking  sector  remains  the  dominant  source  of  credit  for  local \nbusinesses in the region. Worsening the problem, the current economic crisis has increased \nrisk aversion and decreased liquidity. In response, governments have made substantial \nefforts to allocate formal-sector resources to support SMEs through measures such as \nsubsidies and safeguarding banks. However, success has been spotty. Thus, SMEs are still \nstruggling to secure long-term bank loans, working capital and bridge financing. \n4.1  The Process of SME Integration into Global Value Chains \nThis section examines the three main frameworks that researchers have used to understand \nhow firms internationalize and the consequent implications on government policy for SMEs. \nThis will help shed light on the relevant motivating factors for these trends. Although the \nframeworks  define  internationalization  as  the  process  in  which  firms  increase  their \ninvolvements in overseas operations, the focus here is on SMEs and their participation in \nGVCs. \nGVCs  are  evolving  tiered  structures.  The  main  role  is  played  by  a  lead  firm  that \nmanufactures the final product. This firm is supported by a small number of preferred first tier \nsuppliers, which are also supported by other suppliers, and so on, forming a tiered structure \n(Figure 7). It is generally easier to enter a network as a lower-tier supplier. But this position \ntends to be unstable as other suppliers can easily replace the original supplier by offering \nbetter comparative advantages such as lower costs (Abonyi 2005). Therefore the challenge \nfor SMEs is not only to try to enter GVCs, but to move up the tiers by increasing the value \ncontent of their activities. \n11 ", "ADBI Working Paper 231    Lim and Kimura \n \nFigure 7: Original Product Manufacturer and Supplier Structure \nOriginal Product \nManufacturer (LE) \n1st Tier \nSupplier  Supplier  Suppliers \n(LE)  (LE) \n \n2nd Tier \nSupplier  Supplier \nSuppliers \n(LE)  (SME) \n   \n3rd Tier \nSupplier  Supplier  Supplier \nSuppliers \n(SME)  (SME)  (LE) \n4th Tier \nSuppliers \nSupplier  Supplier \n(SME)  (SME) \n   \nLE: Large Enterprise  \nSME: Small or Medium \nEnterprise \n \n \nSource: Abonyi 2005. \nAdmittedly, the frameworks presented below are theoretical and distinct. However, all of \nthem have found some empirical evidence in past studies (see, for example, Lloyd-Reason \net al. 2005; Etemad and Wright 2003), suggesting that harmonizing the different approaches \ninstead  of  viewing  them  as  contradictory  can  help  guide  analyses  of  SME \ninternationalization.  Indeed,  the  theories  seem  to  be  interrelated.  They  all  state  that \nknowledge of foreign markets is a fundamental driver of overseas expansion, although they \nattribute the acquisition of it to different sources. \n4.2  The Stage Approach \nAccording to the stage model, internationalization can be seen as an incremental process \nwhere  different  stages  follow  each  other  in  a  logical  order  (Luostarinen  1994).  The \nassumption is that a firm\u2019s knowledge about foreign markets and commitment to expanding \noverseas  will  consequently  affect  its  business  decisions  and  activities.  As  a  firm\u2019s \ninternational involvement increases, so does its overseas knowledge and commitment, thus \nstarting an expansionary cycle. The process has been described as \u201ca gradual acquisition, \nintegration and use of knowledge about foreign markets and operations and a successively \nincreasing commitment to foreign markets\u201d (Johanson and Vahine 1977: 36). \n12 ", "ADBI Working Paper 231    Lim and Kimura \n \nGovernments can therefore play a critical \u201ctriggering\u201d role by enacting policies to boost \nSMEs\u2019 knowledge of overseas markets and their commitment to expanding abroad. This can \nbe done by providing information services and raising awareness about the benefits of \ninternationalization,  for  instance.  Once  enterprises  have  branched  out  beyond  national \nboundaries, the process is likely to gain momentum on its own. It then becomes more \nimportant for the government to play the role of facilitator, for instance by helping reduce \nentry barriers and lowering the cost of international expansion. \nWith rapid technological advancement and globalization, there has emerged evidence that \nthe  internationalization  process  is  accelerating\u2014a  phenomenon  the  stage  approach  is \ninadequate in explaining. Though small, there have even been an increasing number of \nventures that are global at start-up (Oviatt and McDougall 1997). This phenomenon is better \nexplained by the following two models. \n4.3  The Network Approach \nProponents of the network approach view internationalization as a natural development \nresulting  from  the  process  of  establishing,  improving,  maintaining,  and  dissolving \nrelationships with individuals and firms (Johansson and Mattson 1988). A firm\u2019s network of \nboth local and overseas relationships is seen as a crucial form of capital as it can create \ntrust, raise access to information, and increase the firm\u2019s ability to mobilize resources. As \nfirms internationalize, the number and strength of relationships in their network increases, \nbringing more benefits and helping them integrate further into GVCs. \nIn line with this theory, studies have found that SMEs rely heavily on their networks for many \nactivities when internationalizing, particularly in obtaining market knowledge and looking for \nopportunities (Mohibul and Fernandez 2008). Thus, a firm that wants to internationalize must \nfirst understand the market in which it operates\u2014the environmental conditions and business \nrelationships (Madsen and Servais 1997)\u2014before finding ways to strengthen and utilize its \nnetwork.  \nFacilitating the formation of relationships and linkages within local firms and between local \nand foreign firms should therefore be an essential component of policies helping SMEs \ninternationalize.  The  government  can,  for  example,  assist  SMEs  in  identifying  foreign \nbusiness partners. \n4.4  International Entrepreneurship Theory \nInternational  entrepreneurship  theory  (IET)  states  that  the  basis  for  a  firm\u2019s \ninternationalization  is  international  entrepreneurship,  which  is  defined  as  the  discovery, \nenactment, evaluation, and exploitation of opportunities across national borders to create \nfuture  goods  and  services  (Oviatt  and  McDougall  2005).  Discovery  refers  to  finding \nopportunities.  Enactment  entails  seizing  opportunities  and  acquiring  a  competitive \nadvantage, and evaluation is used to assess the actions taken.  \nThis framework is especially relevant in the current age of technology, where SMEs can \nmake use of cheap and easy ways of getting information and communicating with other \ncountries  to  help  them  expand  their  activities  abroad.  The  approach  is  also  useful  in \nunderstanding international new ventures, which from inception strive to build competitive \nadvantage from the use of their resources and the sale of outputs in various countries (Oviatt \nand McDougall 1994) and therefore defy the traditional stage theories of internationalization. \nResearch on IET suggests that the entrepreneurial qualities of SME leaders are key to a \nfirm\u2019s  internationalization,  particularly  in  the  early  phases  (Etemad  and  Wright  2003). \nHowever, as the business expands further, it gains more knowledge and expertise, and so \nthe characteristics of the enterprise begin to exert more influence. Government policies \naimed  at  helping  SMEs  internationalize  should  thus  include  the  promotion  of \n13 ", "ADBI Working Paper 231    Lim and Kimura \n \nentrepreneurism,  as  well  as  encouraging  and  helping  SMEs  explore  the  usages  and \nopportunities of technology. \n4.5  Fostering Local Firms and Entrepreneurs \nHow to foster local firms and local entrepreneurs in the competitive environment is a big \nconcern for developing countries. In the past, direct or indirect protection for local firms was \ntaken  for  granted  as  part  of  the  infant  industry  protection  argument.  But  now  in  the \nglobalization era, local firms must compete with gigantic MNEs in the open market from the \nbeginning. Determining what sort of industrial policies or SME policies would be justifiable is \none of the most controversial topics among development economists.  \nSMEs play pivotal roles in the functioning of international production networks and economic \nagglomeration. There are certainly ways to foster local firms or SMEs by utilizing globalizing \nforces.  \nThere is evidence that local firms are participating in production and distribution networks, \nparticularly in machinery industries. An empirical study of Thailand, based on an industrial \nsurvey, obtained interesting research findings. First, between MNEs and SMEs there have \nbeen positive spillovers and linkage effects in the machinery industry, but not in other \nindustries so far. Second, the impact of trade liberalization differs from industry to industry. \nTrade liberalization has increased productivity in the machinery industry and labor-intensive \nindustries. Third local firms in machinery industry in particular have received the largest \nbenefits from trade liberalization.  \nAnother  example  of  the  link  between  MNEs  and  local  firms  can  be  found  in  Penang, \nMalaysia. In Penang, many indigenous enterprises have developed through linkages with \nforeign electronics companies. Indigenous enterprises are participating in producing not only \nparts  and  components  but  also  industrial  equipment.  Foreign  assemblers  operating  in \nThailand are also gradually outsourcing to indigenous suppliers. Most of the indigenous \nenterprises that have linked with MNEs are SMEs. Some of them have succeeded in the \nglobal market place, serving customers in Asia and Pacific region and worldwide.  \nEconomic  integration  has  provided  business  opportunities  not  just  in  production  and \ndistribution networks, but also in capturing enlarged markets. For example, a Malaysian \nelectrical appliance firm is expanding OEM production outsourced from MNEs and in the \nprocess of increasing production of OEM, the firm is able to expand to integrated ASEAN \nmarket. It is notable in agricultural products, including food and beverage, that ASEAN \nenterprises have shown a big presence. A Philippine food and beverage industry firm has \nexpanded its business to overseas in Australia, PRC, Indonesia, and Viet Nam. A leading \nThai agro-based company expanded its business into Cambodia, PRC, India, Indonesia, \nMalaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Viet Nam, and other countries.  \nSuch indigenous enterprises have succeeded in establishing linkages with MNEs and thus \nhave expanded their businesses in the integrated global market.  \nPrior to the Asian financial crisis in 1997, rapid and dynamic economic growth in East Asia \nwas  facilitated  through  market-driven  forces.  Various  regional  economic  cooperation \ninitiatives and schemes were introduced, including an agreement on the ASEAN Free Trade \nArea (AFTA) in 1992 that came into full operation by the end of 2003. However, in the past \nthe  impact  of  ASEAN-initiated  regional  cooperation  was  negligible  because  ASEAN \neconomies were basically competing  in the same product range and their main export \nmarkets  were  to  non-ASEAN  countries.  Recently,  however,  there  is  clear  evidence  to \nindicate that the impact of AFTA has encouraged production networking in Thailand, Viet \nNam, and other ASEAN economies on some intermediate and consumer goods. Some \neconomists claimed that de facto economic integration has proceeded in East Asia, even in \nthe absence of effective implementation of AFTA and other regional bilateral trade and \ninvestment agreements. The nature and characteristics of de facto economic integration are \n14 ", "ADBI Working Paper 231    Lim and Kimura \n \nimportant for policy discussion to understand how far integration has been realized and what \nsort of integration has been achieved so far. Understanding such fundamental issues would \nbe helpful for policymakers to design regional and bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) in \norder to facilitate and accelerate the development of regional production networks. The \ndevelopment  of  vertical  production  networks  has  certainly  been  supported  by  trade \nliberalization efforts. On the other hand, the trade regime in East Asia is still far from a single \nproduction base and a single market. Substantial barriers in service trade still remain in East \nAsia. The development of vertical production networks, as well as remaining trade barriers, \naffects the nature of the on-going process of de jure economic integration in East Asia.  \nIt is vitally important to understand the extent of the influence of the GVC and de jure \nregional  trade  agreements  (RTAs)  on  regional  production  networking.  Global  business \ncorporations have extended their production, material, and resource sourcing and markets \nbeyond their domestic economies. Because of the pressure of integration, competition, and \nJust-in-Time (JIT) production system, which is based on timely delivery of spare parts and \ncomponent to minimize the inventory costs, East Asia is now fully connected into a GVC \nsystem in which it produces the world production output. The importance of production \nnetworking,  clustering  (agglomeration),  and  fragmentation  must  be  factored  in  de  facto \nregional FTAs. There are some studies related to the importance of this issue. A future study \nshould examine specific trade and investment areas and sectors.  \n4.6  The Impact of Sub-regional and Bilateral FTAs on Production \nNetworking \nEconomic integration in terms of production networking or value chains has not benefited \nmuch from formal RTAs. The basic weaknesses of the ASEAN Free Trade Area AFTA, \nASEAN  Economic  Community  (AEC),  ASEAN  Investment  Area  (AlA),  and  ASEAN \nFramework Agreement on Services (AFAS) are that there are too many exceptions on key \nsectors of ASEAN economies. Furthermore, the standardization and harmonization of rules \nand  regulations  has  been  inadequate.  Transportation,  infrastructure,  and  institutions  to \nimplement those trade and investment agreements are also absent or inadequate.  \nProduction network and regional economic integration are accelerating in Southeast and \nNortheast Asia within the framework of GVCs and expanding production networks in East \nAsia. These trends are being driven by competition, the rise of the PRC and India, the \npolitical stability of the region relative to other regions, and the availability of productive labor \nforces and resources, all buttressed by individual countries\u2019 macroeconomic regimes and \nliberal trade and investment regimes that promote economic development.  \nDespite many distortions and inefficiencies in implementing ASEAN regional cooperation \nschemes, there are many cumulative positive effects on the rapidly emerging production \nnetworking and agglomeration of industry in East Asia. The clustering of the automobile and \nparts industry in Thailand, the clustering of the electronic industry in Malaysia, and the \nknowledge-based industry cluster in Singapore are cases in point. Indirectly, positive and \nbusiness-friendly policies and institutional environments in Southeast Asian countries have \ncontributed to the emergence of industrial clustering, agglomeration, and production. Further \nand enhanced efforts to accelerate and integrate existing agreements in goods, services, \nand investment are vitally important for ASEAN economies to meet the challenges and \nopportunities related  to the  rise  of  the  PRC, India, and the accelerating trend of GVC \ndevelopment. In the case of Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), \nMyanmar and Viet Nam (CLMV), these countries require development assistance in addition \nto ASEAN regional economic integration. Without adequate development assistance, trade \nand investment liberalization would not be sufficient for these countries, perhaps with the \nexception of Viet Nam, to benefit from the emerging production networking and industrial \nclustering in Southeast Asia.  \n15 ", "ADBI Working Paper 231    Lim and Kimura \n \nEconomic integration through regional and bilateral FTAs can enhance regional production \nnetworking if policymakers can minimize the distortions related to regional and bilateral FTAs \nin East Asia. Since 2000, bilateral FTAs and sub-region FTAs have proliferated throughout \nEast Asia. These bilateral FTAs are based on reciprocal preferential tariff schemes. Both \nparties choose their own sensitive list. This implies that, for example, the ASEAN-PRC FTA \n(ACFTA)  is  counted  as  10  separate  bilateral  FTAs  between  PRC  and  the  10  ASEAN \ncountries. The degree of market access faced by an ASEAN exporter varies according to the \nASEAN  destination  markets.  This  means  that  there  are  45  bilateral  preferential  trade \nrelationships within 10 ASEAN countries. In the same way, the ASEAN-Japan FTA, ASEAN-\nKorea  FTA,  and  ASEAN-India  FTA  are  each  10  separate  bilateral  FTAs.  ASEAN-CER \n(Closer Economic Relation of Australia and New Zealand) constitutes 20 bilateral FTAs. In \ntotal, 105 ASEAN FTAs are enforced and/or under negotiation. Any ASEAN exporter faces \ndifferent  preferential  treatments  based  on  destinations.  Baldwin  (2006)  has  called  the \noverlapping FTA problem the East Asian \"noodle bowl syndrome\". Potentially, 16 countries \nwould produce 120 bilateral FTAs in the region.  \nDifferent  FTA  strategies  by  individual  countries  may  create  severe  overlapping  FTA \nproblems. Because of the different FTA strategies taken by each country, there is much \nheterogeneity  in  exclusion  lists,  tariff  rates,  rules  of  origin  (RoO),  dispute  settlement \nmechanisms, mutual recognition, competition policy, and other norms and regulation among \nexisting multilateral FTAs in Asia. The overlapping FTAs can complicate tariff rates and RoO \nfor the same products, according to the destination. It is commonly agree that the costs \narising from the RoO are expected to increase substantially when there are overlapped \nFTAs and RTAs.  \nOther than a lack of FTA, there are other crucial impediments to East Asia's bilateralism. \nFirst of all, with the exception of a few countries, East Asia has failed to form high level FTAs \nin terms of trade liberalization. Typically, reduction in agricultural trade barriers is important \nfor narrowing development gaps, however, agricultural products tend to be excluded from \nmost Asian preferential tariff treatments.  \nMoreover, the bilateral FTAs in East Asia have addressed trade liberalization in goods, but \nliberalization in service trade has not progressed much.  \nAs  a  result,  economic  integration  in  East  Asia  still  remains  \"shallow\".  Benefits  from \nintegration are limited since there are many border-related barriers other than tariffs.  \nThe policy environment for trade facilitation in East Asia varies considerably by country. For \nexample, custom clearance time is quite different among countries. Custom procedures are \nstill complicated and lack transparency in many East Asian countries. This means that the \npolicy space to facilitate trade, or reduce trade costs, is very large. If trade facilitation \nmeasures such as simplification and harmonization of customs procedure, paperless trading, \nand mutual recognition are improved, they will reduce trade costs and expand production \nnetworks by a considerable extent.  \nThe enhancement of logistic infrastructure system, including that of the institutional system, \nis an issue to be challenged by East Asian policymakers in order to realize deep integration, \nsince it serves to facilitate trade and location of production. A study on cross-border trade \nfacilitation for ASEAN countries by the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) (2006) \nfinds that goods between Bangkok and Hanoi, for example, have been transported mainly by \nsea, which does not fit the JIT production operation prevailing in other parts of East Asia. \nThe JETRO study suggests that if logistic infrastructure systems, such as road networks, \ntransportation terminal facilities, and legal institutions, are developed and established, then \nthe  volume  of  trucking  transportation  would  increase.  In  a  different  context,  land \ntransportation  clusters  and  volume  would  increase  between  Singapore,  Malaysia,  and \nThailand if the three countries would agree to standardize their long-haul trucking system to \nfacilitate cross-border trade and the JIT production network among the three most developed \nASEAN economies.  \n16 ", "ADBI Working Paper 231    Lim and Kimura \n \n5.  EMERGING BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR SMES IN \nTHE REGION \nMNCs have expanded their production, material, and resource sourcing and markets beyond \ntheir domestic economies. Because of the pressures of integration, competition, and JIT \nproduction systems, the region is fully connected into a GVC system that churns out output \nfor  the  global  marketplace.  As  a  result,  globalization  provides  new  opportunities  for \ndeveloping  economies  to  enter  international  trade  through  production  sharing  and \noutsourcing. Since the early 1990s, international production networks have developed in \nASEAN and East Asia, and gradually spread to India, Australia, and New Zealand, driven by \nmarket forces and facilitated by regional, sub-regional, and bilateral FTAs. \nSigns of congestion in economic agglomeration in East Asia are beginning to appear, and \ndispersion forces have started to influence industrial location. There has been a substantial \nincrease in production costs due to agglomeration and the resulting difficulties in securing \nlabor, land, and other factors of production. In particular, labor-intensive and land-intensive \nproduction processes tend to shift location. Therefore, regional economic integration has set \noff dynamic growth impulses through global and regional production networking. In turn, this \nprocess has been facilitated by industrial agglomeration and fragmentation in sequential \norder.  Differences  in  wage  levels  and  land  prices  between  more  developed  and  less \ndeveloped  economies  in  the  region  create  economic  opportunities  for  narrowing  the \ndevelopment gap and effect the spillover effect of growth to other neighboring economies. \nTheir geographical proximity to growth centers would be a drawing point to less developed \nregion but drastic reductions in the set up cost and the service link cost as well as improving \npolicy environments would be required. \n5.1  Latest trends in SME Businesses in Asia and Pacific Region \nGlobalization and regional integration processes are increasing in terms of speed and space. \nCountries that are able to take advantage of these two underlying fundamental forces have \nbeen growing faster and more sustainably. At the same time, economic openness and \ndomestic trade and investment liberalization have dramatically increased competition in the \ndomestic, regional, and global marketplace. Larger and efficient companies are normally \nable to leverage these new opportunities and challenges in domestic markets as well as \nacross external markets. This challenging new economic environment tends to put SMEs at \na  disadvantage  compared  to  large  and  medium-sized  enterprises.  However,  there  is \nempirical evidence to indicate that SMEs continue to develop and prosper in some countries. \nFor example, SMEs in Japan, Korea, Taipei,China, Hong Kong, China, and Singapore are \ndoing  well  and  expanding.  SME  growth  is  not  restricted  to  these  countries  but  also \nincreasingly  in  Thailand  (automobile  and  electronic),  Malaysia  (electronic),  Philippines \n(electronic, ICT), India (ICT, services), Australia, and New Zealand (ICT, services). \nThe  fact  is  that  large  enterprises  (LEs)  and  SMEs  are  the  two  important  drivers  of \ndevelopment in the developing Asia and Pacific region. While MNEs and domestic LEs have \nbeen playing an important role in accelerating the industrialization process, SMEs provide \nthe crucial industrial linkages to set off a chain reaction of broad-based and sustainable \ndevelopment. Without SMEs as subcontractors and suppliers of intermediate inputs to MNEs \nand domestic LEs, industrial growth in developing countries would not be able to realize \nsustainable  increase  in  domestic  value-added,  employment,  productivity,  and  industrial \nlinkages. In the globalizing era of the borderless marketplace, buttressed by regionalization \nand liberalization, SMEs provide an important source of domestic employment creation and \nresilience against more volatile external economic fluctuations, and serve as a mechanism \nfor local capacity building.  \n17 ", "ADBI Working Paper 231    Lim and Kimura \n \nSMEs play a pivotal role in the functioning of international and regional production networks. \nThere are certainly ways to foster local firms and SMEs by utilizing globalizing market forces \nand regional economic integration; the issue is how to provide a critical linkage between \nSMEs and the large local companies and MNCs. Successful cases in Singapore and other \ncountries have proven that governments play a vital role in ensuring a competitive market \nstructure, providing relevant and effective technical upgrading, marketing information and \nmanagement, consortium financing, and clustering (economies of scale) to SMEs. \nWhile trade and investment liberalization and globalization are detrimental to the domestic \ngrowth of SMEs, there are counter-policy measures that can be implemented to synergize \nthe negative effects of globalization and regionalization to result in a more dynamic, rapid, \nand sustainable regional economic development. The development of SMEs in the region is \nimportant as success in this effort will go a long way toward reducing regional and domestic \nincome gaps, creating a balance of income and employment, and securing sustainable \nhuman and social security. To achieve this, there is a need to improve SMEs\u2019 international \ncompetitiveness through SME promotion policies, financing, and the tax system. SMEs can \nbe sharpened in their ability to compete through improvement of competitiveness due to \nresearch  and  development,  improvement  of  quality  control,  and  skill.  To  upgrade  the \nproduction  process  and  capture  a  larger  share  of  value-added, the government  should \npromote the development of local parts and supplier industries. This seems an effective \navenue  to  increase  the  domestic  content  of  MNCs  operating  in  the  country.  The \ndevelopment  of  domestic  suppliers  would  require  a  package  of  technical  assistance, \nincluding the provision of training to develop the skills of local suppliers together with access \nand  availability  of  finance  along  with  increased  linkages  between  SMEs  and  large \nenterprises. \nAs  regional  production  networking  becomes  more  important  as  a  source  of  economic \ngrowth,  outsourcing  and  subcontracting  will  offer  increasing  opportunities  for  SMEs  to \ncapitalize on regional economic integration. Alternative and important emerging business \nopportunities for SMEs are the advent of Internet businesses and the widespread use of \nelectronic and computer business design. Because of the electronic and computer revolution \nin business management and practices, many SMEs in Singapore and Hong Kong, China \nare expanding their business operation from homes and other flexible arrangements. Such \nflexibility in doing business comes about due to the infinite business opportunities offered \nthrough  the  borderless  cyberspace  world.  This  new  mode  of  doing  business  reduces \nbusiness and transaction costs enormously. \nSMEs are also expanding very rapidly in the service sector of tourism and specialized \nmarketing  to  newly  emerging  markets  beyond  the  domestic  market  as  the  process  of \nregional economic integration. Regional integration is further facilitated through reduction in \ntariff and non-tariff barriers and the harmonization of standards and customs procedures. In \naddition, free movement of capital and skilled professionals would facilitate the formation of \nan integrated single market and production base. \nAs regional integration is broadened and deepened toward a single market and production \nbase, competition and market size increase at the same time. This is a positive effect of \nregional integration. Without a corresponding increase in the efficiency of local firms and \nSMEs, regional integration cannot be sustained as there will be more domestic opposition \ndue to increased economic and social instability and unemployment. This is the crux of \nregional economic integration that underpins its sustainability, that it must not only increase \nefficiency but also provide positive and acceptable benefits to every constituent member \nwithin the free trade area or economic community. \nWith the processes of regional cooperation and economic integration, economies tend to \nexperience higher economic growth. However, the higher rate of gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth may not be accompanied by a higher rate of employment. With globalisation \nand regional integration, there is a tendency that the rate of increase of output (GDP) and \n18 ", "ADBI Working Paper 231    Lim and Kimura \n \nthe rate of increase of employment to not be proportionally linked. In other words, a country \nmay have a much higher rate of increase in output than the rate of increase in employment. \nIn addition, regional integration may tend to increase income disparity among members of \nthe preferential trading area, if some countervailing measures are not properly instituted. In \nthis respect, the development of viable and sustainable SMEs provides an effective measure \nto counter the negative effects of globalisation and regional economic integration. \nTherefore, improving the competitiveness and capability of SMEs is vital for the sustainability \nof  regional  economic  integration. There  are manifold  elements  required  to  improve  the \ncompetitiveness of SMEs. Countries at different stages of economic development require \ndifferent core policy instruments aimed at improving their SMEs\u2019 capability development. \nExperience drawn from successful SME development in Korea, Taipei,China, and Singapore \nindicates  that  technology  and  industry  upgrading  are  the  core  measures  that  must  be \ncontinually implemented in order to stay competitive, in addition to clustering and improved \nmarketing capability. \nThese countries set up central institutions to monitor and diffuse new technologies and \nprovided technological services that SMEs could not provide for themselves, These included \nmaterial testing, inspection and certification of quality, instrument calibration, establishment \nof  repositories  of  technical  information,  patent  registration,  research  and  design  and \ntechnical training. The Singapore Institute of Standards and Industrial Research has an \nincubator scheme that allows SMEs and innovators to make use of the Institute\u2019s space, \nequipment  and  technical  advice,  and  provides  common  facilities  for  local  firms  to  do \nresearch and development. These services are not given free, but are offered at affordable \nrates due to economies of scale and clustering effects. These three countries also provided \ntraining and management consultancy facilities for SMEs along with subsidized credit, tax \nincentives,  and  financial  guarantees  to  capital  market  imperfections.  As  for  technology \nupgrading, cost sharing was adopted to ensure that companies take the programs seriously. \nTrade facilitation and technical assistance are normally attached with regional and bilateral \nFTAs. For example, the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) has the Initiative for ASEAN \nIntegration (IAI) to narrow the development gap between the more developed six ASEAN \ncountries and CLMV countries. Equally, the ASEAN-PRC FTA, ASEAN-Japan FTA, ASEAN-\nKorea  FTA,  have  preferential  treatment  and  development  assistance  extended  to  less \ndeveloped economies. Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) has an economic and \ntechnical (Eco-Tech) program as an integral part of the process of trade and investment \nliberalisation  in  the  Asia-Pacific  region.  Regional  cooperation  and  integration  among \ncountries  with  differing  stages  of  economic  development  must  be  accompanied  with \ndevelopment assistance, technological transfer and enhancing capability schemes in order \nto  be  effective  and  sustainable.  International  division  of  labour  and  specialization  has \nbecome an important feature of international and regional trade and investment patterns and \nthe development of technological capability of SMEs is an integral policy of liberalising trade \nand  investment  regime.  Regional  economic  integration  opens  up  opportunities  and \nchallenges for policy makers to provide industrial and technological upgrading to SMEs. \n6.  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION \nThe importance of SMEs in the age of globalization, production networking, and regional \neconomic integration is well documented and firmly established in the literature. The central \nquestion  is  why  some  countries  have  successfully  transformed  and  established  viable, \ncompetitive,  and  sustainable  SMEs  development  while  the majority  of  other  developing \ncountries have failed. The answer is complex and requiring of country-specific, sectoral level \nanalysis as well as the examination of economic, political, social, and cultural elements in a \ndynamic  context.  However,  some  elements  can  be  used as  basic  policy  guidelines for \ndeveloping SMEs. \n19 ", "ADBI Working Paper 231    Lim and Kimura \n \nSuccessful cases of SMEs development in Japan, Korea, Taipei,China, Hong Kong, China, \nSingapore, Thailand, Malaysia, India, and many other countries have adopted long-term \ncomprehensive, coordinated and consistent policies. Often, empirical evidence shows that \ncorrect  policy  measures  for  SMEs  in  developing  countries  are  not  coordinated  among \nrelevant ministries, agencies, and organizations, which in the long run results in inconsistent \npolicies. Therefore, governments and responsible agencies must develop \u201cbest practices\u201d on \nthe  ideal  business  environment,  training  and  upgrading,  financing,  marketing  and \nmanagement, sub-contracting, and networking and monitoring mechanisms to ensure that \nSME policies are efficiently and effectively carried out. Successful case studies invariably \nindicate that effective collaboration between government, trade associations, education, and \ntraining  institutions  is  important  in  reducing  cost  for  human  resource  development  and \ncapacity building. \nLikewise, the dissemination of information through the effective use of available ICT should \nbe maximally used. In this context, the establishment of national and regional corporate \ncredit information and database and credit guarantee system in the region should be given \nhigh priority. The establishment of such database and credit information would contribute \nsignificantly to the problem of trade financing and other financing aspects of SMEs. \nGlobalization and regional integration require the healthy and sustainable existence of SMEs \nand their development in the region. The proliferation of bilateral and sub-regional FTAs has \ncreated duplication and overlapping of RoOs and other trade and investment rules and \nregulations that would increase the transaction cost of doing business in the region, affecting \nSMEs adversely. It is necessary to create a conducive business environment through the \nprovision of standardization of products and services, rules and regulations and a seamless \nmarket infrastructure in the region. \n20 ", "ADBI Working Paper 231    Lim and Kimura \n \nREFERENCES \nAbonyi, G. 2005.
