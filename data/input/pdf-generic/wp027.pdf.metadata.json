INTRODUCTION\nM\nuch has been written about the digital divide: the division of the world between those\nwho have access to new information and communications technology (ICT) and those\nwho do not. This inequitable access to ICT has implications for productivity and economic\ngrowth of rich and poor countries. For example, the United Nations Development Programme\n(1999, 63) notes: \u201cThe network society is creating parallel communications systems: one for those\nwith income, education and literacy connections, giving plentiful information at low cost and high\nspeed: the other are those without connections, blocked by high barriers of time, cost and uncertainty\nand dependent upon outdated information.\u201d Similar concerns have been expressed by such authors\nas Dertouzos (1997) and Sachs (2000) with the latter claiming that a new map of the world has\nbeen created, this time based on technology. However, there are many others who are much more\noptimistic. For example, Negroponte (1998) opines that ICT has a \u201cleapfrogging\u201d characteristic\nthat will enable the poor to catch up. As latecomers, developing countries can embrace existing\ntechnologies developed elsewhere and skip intermediate stages allowing them to save on\nconsiderable costs of development. In light of the contending viewpoints, it is important to learn\nwhat the basic economic determinants of the digital divide are and the ways to overcome it.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. Section II provides a brief discussion of the\nvarious types of ICT, which constitute the backbone of the digital economy. Section III is devoted\nto a discussion of the determinants of ICT adoption. The quantitative analysis provided in this\nsection suggests that there is a strong association between ICT adoption with the socioeconomic\ncharacteristics of the country. In light of this discussion, the paper makes in Section IV some\ninferences about the policy choices for developing countries that would like to promote ICT adoption.\nThe discussion of this section is primarily focused on Asian countries. However, despite the particular\nempirical focus of the present analysis, it is hoped that the insights from this analysis would be\nequally applicable to other parts of the developing world. The paper provides some concluding\nremarks in Section V.\nII. TYPES OF ICT\nDepending on the type of use, the new ICT can be roughly divided into three broad\ncategories, that is, ICT for (i) computing, (ii) communication, and (iii) Internet-enabled\ncommunication and computing.\nWith the invention of computers, which represents the most significant technological\nbreakthrough of the last half of the 20th century, the cost of computing has declined exponentially\nover the years. And the usage of computers has increased by leaps and bounds with the introduction\nof personal computers. At the most general level, computers augment and improve thinking\n1", "ERD Working Paper No. 27\nDIGITAL DIVIDE: DETERMINANTS AND POLICIES WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO ASIA\ncapabilities of individuals and organizations and enhance their efficiency. One important example\nrelates to the business management system, known as \u201centerprise resource planning\u201d (ERP), where\nnew softwares enable firms to efficiently integrate all facets of business, including planning,\nmanufacturing, sales, and marketing. Another example of an important use of computing is\ncomputer-aided manufacturing and computer-aided design (CAD/CAM) in the product design for\nthe manufacturing process. This process has radically improved product lifecycles\u2014in particular,\nit has reduced the time lag between conceptualization of the product and its entry into the market\u2014\nas well as the quality and complexity of product design.1\nCommunication, which is one of the most important aspects of modern human life, has\ntwo broad categories: one-way and two-way communication. The most common form of\ncommunication is one-way communication, which includes the broadcasting media like radio and\ntelevision. Two-way communication devices, which include faxes, telephones, telegraphs, and pagers,\nhave improved significantly over the last two decades or so. The Internet\u2019s growth is largely a\nfunction of two-way communication links: between telephone lines and personal computers (PCs).\nHowever, in most developing countries, mobile telephones are easier to obtain than traditional\nfixed landline telephones. Therefore, the movement of the Internet and Internet applications into\nmobile phone systems will have a tremendous technological implication for these countries.\nThe Internet, including the World Wide Web, is one of the most important technologies\nto affect both communication and computing. The Internet provides, on one hand, a new\ncommunication medium that allows activities like e-mail or chat lists for group communication,\nand on the other, multiple modes of communication by fostering new interfaces between new and\nold forms of communication. For example, one can now communicate via voice to others through\nInternet telephony, or use mobile phones to access the Web. The Internet also provides communities\nwith a whole new means of communication (i.e., many-to-many point communication such as chat\nlists and discussion forums), and collaborative platforms. The World Wide Web, where people can\nsearch for and obtain information on the Internet, enables people to post messages, create home\npages, and communicate with many others.\nThe Internet not only provides individuals with access to more information but also facilitates\nnew ways of representing information (multimedia), structuring information (through hyperlinks),\nand creating information (through collaborative and distance work). Unlike many other media\nthat treat users as passive, the Internet is an active medium that demands a greater degree of\nsophisticated thinking and logical skills.\nThe rapid transformation of the Internet, as it moves beyond PCs into palmtops, mobile\nphones, and appliances, has radically changed not only communications but also commerce and\ncomputing in all fields, including scientific computing and business automation. Already, Bluetooth\n1 An important advantage of CAD/CAM over conventional designs is its ability to transfer information regarding\ndesigns readily and accurately across organizational and national boundaries without distortions. In recent\nyears, the use of CAD/CAM has become widespread in multinational enterprises across the world.\n2", "Section III\nDeterminants of ICT Adoption\ntechnological standards and devices allow any device to electronically \u201ctalk\u201d to another device\nthrough wireless systems, including the wireless Web, cell phones, and laptops. With the advent\nof new ICT, e-commerce has increased rapidly along with trade in information products. In business,\nthe simple automation of business processes like accounting and payroll, and the subsequent\nintegration of these functions via ERP software, are being gradually replaced by Web-based inter-\nenterprise or intra-enterprise ERP, supply chain management, auctions for procuring supplies,\nand the like.\nIII. DETERMINANTS OF ICT ADOPTION\nThe status of ICT adoption of an economy is an indicator of its potential ability to exploit\nthe economic opportunities afforded by the new technologies\u2014or more generally, its prospects\nfor transition to the \u201cnew economy.\u201d As expected, the adoption of ICT varies significantly across\ncountries. Like anywhere in the world, Asian countries have experienced a rise in the use of personal\ncomputers in recent years, though the degree of expansion has varied between countries.\nTable 1 shows the most recent estimates of the numbers of PCs among Asian developing\ncountries. The newly industrialized economies (NIEs) are, quite expectedly, heading the pack and\ntheir figures are comparable to those of the advanced countries. For example, Singapore has 527.2\npersonal computers per thousand people in 1999, which is 1.8 times the figure of Japan in the\nsame year. The rest of the developing countries, including India, which has achieved a large measure\nof international success in software development, have far fewer numbers of personal computers\nper capita, compared to the NIEs. The South Asian countries appear to have the lowest per capita\ncomputers in the list, ranging from one computer per thousand people in Bangladesh to 4.3\ncomputers in Pakistan.\nAlong with personal computers other indicators of ICT diffusion in an economy include\nusage of televisions, main line telephones, mobile phones, fax machines, and Internet. Table 1\nprovides a picture of ICT diffusion across Asian countries. Whether it is the use of cellular phones,\nmain line telephones, or the Internet, their distributions across countries follow a pattern similar\nto per capita ownership of PCs. The striking picture that emerges from Table 1 is one of extreme\ninequality\u2014one of the haves and the have-nots\u2014representing a stark digital divide between\ncountries.2\n2 It is estimated that more than 75 percent of Internet users live in high-income economies, which contain only\n14 percent of the global population. Internet use in countries like Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and  United States\nhas already reached more than half the population. This is in stark contrast with the rest of the world. For\nexample, Internet use in South Asia is only 0.4 percent of its population (UNDP 2001).\n3", "ERD Working Paper No. 27\nDIGITAL DIVIDE: DETERMINANTS AND POLICIES WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO ASIA\nTable 1.

What are the basic economic determinants of ICT diffusion?\nAre the determinants of adoption and diffusion different in developing Asia from the rest of the\nworld? To address these queries, we undertook a set of elementary regression exercises covering\nmore than 100 countries. These exercises cover a varying number of observations per indicator\nof ICT diffusion depending on the availability of cross-country data. An Asian dummy was included\nin each of the regression equations to determine the extent of variation in ICT diffusion in the\nregion from the rest of the world. However, due to lack of disaggregated data, this discussion does\nnot make any distinction between different usages of ICT: whether it is used as a consumption\nor production item. While the quantitative results are tentative, they are highly suggestive and\nseem to be in broad sympathy with the results available from advanced countries such as Japan\nand the United States (US).\n4", "Section III\nDeterminants of ICT Adoption\nHow do country characteristics such as income and population size affect the use of ICT?\nSimple regression analysis suggests the following. First, computer usage is strongly correlated\nwith GDP per capita, with an income elasticity of computer usage exceeding unity (see Table 2).\nSimilarly, Internet use is highly correlated with income, with income elasticity being nearly 2.\nThe usage of other types of ICT (fax machine, telephone main lines, television, cellular phone)\nis highly income-elastic. Second, as far as population size is concerned, regression analysis does\nnot suggest any additional benefit from a larger size as far as personal computer, telephone main\nline, and Internet use is concerned. However, when income is controlled, the use of cell phones\nand televisions appears to increase with the rise of population. This may reflect the simplicity\nof the technology involved and their easy availability for purchase in most countries. Third, in\nall cases, the Asian dummy was insignificant, implying that these relationships are not substantially\ndifferent in Asia from the rest of the world.\nTable 2.

Simple regression results, as reported in\nTable 3, suggest the following. The relationship between computer usage and education is\nstatistically significant at the 1 percent level with tertiary education. The same is true as far as\nInternet use is concerned. Moreover, secondary education is also significant at the 1 percent level\nfor telephone. It may be noted that the firm-level evidence from Japan and the US confirms the\n5", "ERD Working Paper No. 27\nDIGITAL DIVIDE: DETERMINANTS AND POLICIES WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO ASIA\ncomplementarity of tertiary education with ICT use (Bresnahan, Brynjolfsson, and Hitt 1999).\nFor other types of ICT, such as cellular phone, fax machines, and television, education does not\nplay any significant part.\nTable 3.

All the\nregressions include an Asia dummy that is statistically insignificant, and a population control, both of which are not\nreported.\nSources: International Telecommunication Union (2000), World Bank (2000), and UNESCO (2000).\nIs there any complementarity between different types of ICT? Table 4, which reports a\nset of simple regression results, suggests the following. First, telephone use is strongly correlated\nwith PC and Internet use. Internet has high correlation with telephone largely reflecting their\ncomplementary nature.\n6", "Section III\nDeterminants of ICT Adoption\nTable 4.

All the regressions include an Asia dummy that was statistically insignificant, and a population control,\nboth of which are not reported.\nSources: World Bank (2000) and International Telecommunication Union (2000).\nSecond, as expected, there is no complementarity between telephone use and television\nuse and between telephone use and cellular phone use. Third, the correlation between Internet\nusage and income level increases when controlled for telephones. This suggests that in the presence\nof a well-developed telephone infrastructure, income level becomes the principal determining\nvariable.\nFinally, our cross-country regression analysis suggests the existence of a nonlinear\nrelationship between income and telephone lines. This relationship indicates that there is a serious\ndearth of telephones at low-income countries, but after a country reaches a threshold income level,\ntelephones become relatively commonplace. Figure 1 represents this relationship, which is a third\ndegree polynomial with statistically significant coefficients. Among the Asian economies, the NIEs\nhave the highest per capita availability of telephones, somewhat comparable to other advanced\ncountries. There may be two different reasons for this distinct separation among countries in terms\nof telephone use. The first reason relates to supply factors: it simply reflects the fact that higher-\nincome countries may have well-developed infrastructures. The second reason relates to demand\nfactors: it reflects the benefits of the so-called network externality. That is, the benefits of getting\na telephone rise as the number of people with telephones in the economy increases.\nIn short, it appears that the principal determining factors for the diffusion of ICT in\ndeveloping countries are income and investments in human resource and infrastructure\ndevelopment. However, the degree of influence of these variables is not uniform across the various\ntypes of ICT.\n7", "ERD Working Paper No. 27\nDIGITAL DIVIDE: DETERMINANTS AND POLICIES WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO ASIA\nFigure 1.

POLICIES TO PROMOTE ICT\nWhile there is a close interconnection between income and ICT diffusion, this relationship\nis not a watertight one. The performance of many countries is better than what is warranted by\ntheir per capita incomes (whereas that of many others is worse than what is warranted by their\nper capita incomes). This can be seen from the divergences of individual country performances\nfrom the international averages for their respective income levels.  In this paper we calculate\nsuch divergences for the Internet, the principal component of the new ICT revolution. The\ninternational \u201caverage\u201d line was derived by regressing Internet adoption against per capita income\nof the countries expressed in purchasing-power-parity terms. Table 5 shows the estimates of\ndivergences for a number of Asian countries. These divergences from the averages are largely\nthe result of relevant physical and social investments promoted by these countries. Some countries\nhave underinvested compared to their international averages for that income level. These countries\nneed to increase their investment levels in those activities if they do not want to fall behind their\n\u201ccomparator\u201d countries in adoption and diffusion of ICT. That would also require, among others,\ngetting their relevant policies and institutions right.\n8", "Section IV\nPolicies to Promote ICT\nTable 5.

Investment in Education\nAs our earlier analysis suggests, the relationship between education and ICT is\ncritical.Education is important because it provides the skills required for creating, adapting, and\nutilizing such technologies. This is not to deny that even the illiterate or near-literate can possibly\ntake advantage of certain technological applications. But to go beyond elementary applications,\neducation becomes increasingly important. Indeed, international evidence suggests that education\nis a strong complement to Internet use and that the relevant educational levels are secondary\nand tertiary levels as they are expected to upgrade the national capacity for adaptation and\n9", "ERD Working Paper No. 27\nDIGITAL DIVIDE: DETERMINANTS AND POLICIES WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO ASIA\ninnovation.3 Therefore, if a country aspires to exploit in significant ways the opportunities offered\nby new ICT, particularly the creation of new industries, it needs to emphasize secondary and tertiary\neducation. This lesson is in contrast with conventional wisdom that poorer countries should\nemphasize primary education that yields the higher rate of social returns to these countries\n(Psacharopoulos 1994). However, in most poor developing countries where illiteracy abounds and\nthe importance of ICT-related industries has not reached a significant level, it may be premature\nto overturn the conventional wisdom.\nThose developing countries that have already reached universal primary education for their\ncitizens should place more emphasis on secondary and tertiary education, particularly focusing\non science, mathematics, engineering, and computing if they want to take advantage of new ICT\nopportunities. Nevertheless, one does not need to rely exclusively on the government for promoting\nsecondary and tertiary education. Many individuals who would like to take advantage of ICT\nopportunities are economically well off and may not need government financial assistance. For\nothers, improved availability of student loans from the financial system can be a major help in\nfinancing their educational expenses.\nIn addition to formal education, a rapidly changing technology like ICT would require\ncontinuous training on the part of the workforce. But the principal responsibility of imparting\nsuch training should lie with the concerned firms in line with their requirements. However, the\ngovernment can also play an important part in inducing the firms to impart such training through\nvarious types of tax incentives (UNDP 2001).\nB. Investment in Infrastructure\nFor a country to succeed in ICT, one critical element is physical infrastructure in\ntelecommunications links. The government has an important role in creating such infrastructure,\nespecially in the poorer countries. This role stems from a number of important considerations.\nFirst, in very poor countries, the market forces may be shy both because of lack of effective demand\nand because of lumpiness of investment.\nSecond, even in countries where the private sector is not shy, the government has to play\nthe role of a catalyst and a regulator.  It appears that there are potentially many opportunities\nfor fostering partnerships in the creation of infrastructure. To attract the private sector, the\ngovernment may have to play the role of a catalyst by instituting various innovative incentive\nmechanisms such as build-own-operate, build-own-transfer, etc. Even when the private sector is\nalready there, the government has an important function as a regulator. It may be noted that\nthe telecommunications industry, which constitutes the basic infrastructure for ICT, is a natural\nmonopoly.\n3 Much of the Internet-based information is textual and in English. In many developing countries, a significant\nproportion of the rural population is either illiterate or has an education no higher than the elementary level.\nTherefore, a large segment of the rural population may not be able to access and comprehend the Web-based\ninformation.\n10", "Section IV\nPolicies to Promote ICT\nThird, despite the strong case for a competitive market in ICT, many countries still maintain\nstrong barriers against entry. This entry barrier, along with the heavy government involvement\nin such ICT-related sectors as telephones, has spawned pervasive corruption in many developing\ncountries and has hiked up costs of communication. Privatization or deregulation would be the\nmost efficient response to such a conundrum. Keeping their markets open to foreign trade and\ninvestment augurs well for the development of the ICT industry. Openness speeds up transfer\nof technology and encourages investments on ICT. It has been suggested that multinational\ncompanies as well as local firms take into account the existence of ICT networks as one of the\nrequirements for investments.\nFourth, governments in developing countries should foster an environment that would\nencourage innovation through research and development. It may be noted that developed countries\nthat have established their lead in the ICT realm have invested heavily in research and development\n(R&D). In the period 1992-1997, R&D in countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation\nand Development accounted for 1.8 percent of GDP while that in East Asia and South Asia averaged\n0.8 percent in the same period (Rodriguez and Wilson 2000). With fiscal incentives and proper\nenforcement of property rights, the private sector would have the impetus to engage in R&D\nactivities. However, in areas where the market fails, particularly in basic research, the government\nshould take the lead. Aside from direct investments in R&D, the government can encourage research\nlinkages between universities and the ICT industry. However, not every country can be in the\ncutting edge of technology. For most developing countries, which are followers in the technology\nfield, the focus of R&D efforts should be in the area of adaptation of technologies according to\nlocal needs and conditions.\nFinally, the government can play an important role in ensuring the telecom network\nstandard. In many developed countries in Europe, the fortuitous outcome of a uniform network\nhas come through the dominance of a single company or through the cooperation of several strong\ncompanies. But the situation is not so fortuitous in many other countries where a total chaos or\nnear chaos, in terms of standards, prevails. In the US, several incompatible mobile communications\nstandards exist side by side. In developing countries, the government can play a more proactive\nrole in circumventing such chaotic outcomes by imposing socially optimal standards.\nC. Creation of Favorable Institutions\nFor those countries that seek to play an important role in the development and export\nof ICT items such as software, they need to foster an institutional environment conducive to such\ndevelopment. An important element of such an environment that would foster investment and\nharness creativity relates to adequate protection of property rights, enforcement of contracts, rule\nof law, and personal autonomy etc., without which the economic incentives of firms to invest or\ninnovate would be largely eroded. These institutional aspects, which are an important prerequisite\nfor the successful adoption of new ICT but are often weak in poorer countries, need to be improved.\nBut at the same time, the new ICT ideas are often interconnected and draw on each other\u2019s concepts,\n11", "ERD Working Paper No. 27\nDIGITAL DIVIDE: DETERMINANTS AND POLICIES WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO ASIA\nwhich makes the task of defining the ownership of the intellectual product as well as appropriating\nthe benefits all the more difficult. The task of defining intellectual property and the appropriate\nmechanism for protection has been the subject of good deal of discussion. When such \u201cproperty\u201d\ncan be defined, one well-known method of protecting such property is of course the granting of\npatent rights, which offers the right incentives to the creators. However, as is well known, such\na policy creates at the same time a large element of distortion (because of the monopolistic nature\nof production) and may sometimes act as stumbling blocks to future innovations. Other methods\nto encourage innovation include a recent proposal by Kremer (1998) who suggests the introduction\nof a system of prizes based on what the private firms would pay for the monopoly to produce the\nitem in question. While this is an interesting proposal, it involves substantial public expenditure\non rewards for countries that are otherwise financially constrained. In any case, whatever approach\nthe government takes to manage innovation, the wrong approach would be to micromanage it.\nIf certain types of ICT are considered socially desirable merit goods (for example, those\nitems related to education, etc.), a case can be made for their wide diffusion among the populace.\nHowever, diffusion of useful ICT technologies is likely to involve substantial positive externality.\nIn these circumstances, a case may be made for subsidization of ICT use like undertaking efforts\nto establish communal access to specific types of ICT.\nSimilarly, research suggests that the use of ICT has been most productive in firms with\na flat and less hierarchical organization structure. This type of organization is more common in\nthe US than elsewhere in the world. One way to promote such an organizational structure is by\nkeeping markets open and competitive (Cohen, De Long, and Zysman 2000). The government policy\nshould therefore avoid pursuing policies that foster a closed and monopolistic environment in the\nname of \u201cnurturing the infant industry.\u201d\nD. Fostering New Institutional Innovations\nFor developing countries, it is difficult to provide first-class infrastructure for the whole\ncountry. One way to circumvent the problem is to create special \u201ctechnology parks\u201d to cater to\nthe specific needs of the ICT industry. These high-tech locations offer superior infrastructure (such\nas uninterrupted power supply, satellite downlinks, etc.), provide many fiscal incentives (tax holidays\netc.), and assure investors of expeditious government approvals and other logistic assistance.4\n4 Some technology parks have achieved considerable success. The Singapore Science Park hosts more than 200\nIT-related R&D firms. India has developed a number of such parks in Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and\nChennai. Another notable example is Taipei,China\u2019s Hsinchu Park, which has an area of 580 hectares and\nemploys more than 70,000 R&D staff. Malaysia\u2019s Multimedia Super Corridor is a more recent high-profile addition.\nIn the Philippines, Metro Manila hosts a number of such technology parks, which are becoming the data center\nhub for many foreign companies. Meanwhile, the Zhong-Guang village in People\u2019s Republic of China has within\nits vicinity 68 universities/colleges as well as over 230 state-level research institutes. Its tenants include over\n6500 firms (Furuta 2001).\n12", "Section IV\nPolicies to Promote ICT\nHowever, these technology parks are not limited to developing countries only. Such\ntechnology hubs have also emerged in developed countries, often through private efforts but mostly\nthrough a combination of private and government efforts. What are the preconditions for success\nof these hubs? Based on interviews with the local government officials and representatives of the\nbusiness and the media, the Wired Magazine made an evaluation of the quality of about 50 leading\ntechnology hubs of the world. Each hub was rated according to four criteria revealing the factors\nthat influence investors in their site selection: the ability of universities and research facilities\nin the area to develop new technologies and provide training opportunities; the presence of\nestablished firms and multinational companies; the entrepreneurial drive to start new ventures\nby the population; and the availability of venture capital to bring ideas to the market (Hillner\n2000). As expected, those technology hubs in Asia that are rated highly are essentially those that\nbelong to the higher-income countries with the exception of Bangalore in India.5\nFrom the experiences of these special technological hubs, a number of important lessons\nseem to emerge. First and foremost, infrastructure matters and it should be easily available to\nICT entrepreneurs if the country aspires to succeed in this area. The government has an important\nrole to play in the provision of the infrastructure. Second, rather than trying to micromanage\nthe private sector, the government should provide strong support to its growth by fostering an\nappropriate policy environment where entrepreneurship can flourish. Superior flexibility and\nautonomy are considered critical elements of a successful e-economy environment (Cohen, DeLong,\nand Zysman 2000). Third, the availability of human capital in the form of skilled workers is\ntremendously important for the success of such a park or hub.  Finally, the ability to attract\nmultinational companies and venture capital is likely to be critical in the successful growth of\nthe location.\nIn light of the above, it is unlikely that all developing countries would succeed in developing\nspecial technology hubs. Nor should every country attempt to do so. Before attempting to undertake\nsuch a venture, each country should make a comprehensive evaluation of their true economic costs\nand benefits. In many cases, these technology hubs in developing countries could turn out to be\nenclaves of technological excellence and sophistication with little spillovers\u2014technological or human\ncapital\u2014for the rest of the economy.\n5 This list includes some of the Asian cities: Taipei, Bangalore, Tokyo, Kyoto, Hsinchu, Hong Kong, Inchon, and\nKuala Lumpur.\n13", "ERD Working Paper No. 27\nDIGITAL DIVIDE: DETERMINANTS AND POLICIES WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO ASIA\nE. International Cooperation\nIn addition to national efforts, international organizations can play a role in promoting\nICT in poorer countries.6 A specific set of policy initiatives that international organizations could\nsupport to bridge the digital divide may include the creation of uniform standards through technical\nassistance and policy advice. However, premature standardization can become impediments to\ntechnological innovations. Second, in many developing countries, government monopoly\npredominates in the telecommunications sector. The international organizations can play a role\nin deregulating this sector as well as ensuring free entry of the private sector, including foreign\nfirms. Also, as we have noted earlier, there are instances where there is an economic case for\ngovernment subsidization or tax incentives. In poorer countries, where the government is fiscally\nconstrained, international organizations can offer the necessary financial assistance to create the\nbasic infrastructure, as the private sector\u2014both domestic and foreign\u2014may not be forthcoming\nfor obvious economic reasons.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThe advent of new types of ICT, in conjunction with globalization, has opened up fresh\nopportunities for economic and social transformations from which both developed and developing\ncountries can immensely benefit. In this regard, two important features of new ICT have been\nemphasized. First, unlike previous technological innovations, access to new technologies\u2014and\nthe benefits they can bestow\u2014can be almost immediate to developing countries. New ICT can\nbe applied selectively and innovatively to directly enhance the welfare of the poor, although the\nexisting data do not afford a full-fledged cost-benefit assessment (Quibria and Tschang 2001). Second,\nnew types of ICT are likely to contribute toward a more efficient integration of the global labor\nmarkets than was considered possible before. While the forces of globalization are rapidly breaking\ndown trade and investment barriers, new types of ICT are facilitating relocation of manufacturing\nand services industries more in line with comparative advantage across the world. The new types\nof ICT promote more efficient delivery of services, especially where such services can be digitized,\nand ensure rapid dissemination of market information. This process has the potential of bringing\n6 The increasing concern for the widening digital divide between the developed and developing countries has\nled to a flurry of activities in the international development community. The Group of 8 (G-8) countries have\nadopted the Okinawa Charter on the Global Information Society in its summit in July 2000 to assist developing\ncountries in their efforts to narrow the digital divide. The G-8 created the Digital Opportunity Task Force (Dot\nForce) that includes stakeholders from G-8 and developing country governments, private and nonprofit sectors,\nand international organizations (DOT Force 2000). In the area of bilateral cooperation, Japan pledged to provide\n$15 billion in development assistance over five years to overcome the digital divide.  International organizations\nlike the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank have also placed special emphasis on ICT dissemination\nin poor countries in their list of priorities.\n14", "Section V\nConclusion\nabout a more seamless integration of the global labor markets\u2014including those for unskilled\nworkers\u2014and elimination of absolute poverty.\nNotwithstanding the immense potential of new types of ICT, many observers feel that the\ndigital divide will not evaporate immediately or automatically. It is also felt that an aggressive\nstrategy of investment in ICT, neglecting other critical developmental priorities, solely with the\nobjective of eliminating the digital divide, may be counterproductive. Such a strategy will simply\ndetract attention from the more fundamental developmental needs that many countries require\nto address on an urgent basis. They include such fundamental constraints to economic development\nas improving the basic infrastructure; opening up markets; breaking telecommunication monopolies;\npursuing an effective legal and regulatory system; and providing education for all. For countries\nthat try to skirt these problems, their efforts at computerization and Internet access may turn\nout to be mere wasteful investments\u2014and indeed a recipe for financial disasters, given the scope\nfor better use of scarce investible resources elsewhere in the economy.7\nIf governments in poor countries channel their scarce financial and political resources to\ndeveloping social and human capital, building the basic infrastructure and creating a level playing\nfield for the private sector, that will go a long way in creating the prerequisites for the ICT sector\nto flourish. Beginning modestly with such areas as data processing and teleworking, the poor\ncountries can gradually move to more sophisticated tasks of software development and hardware\ninnovation.  Thus, notwithstanding the concerns voiced on the perils of being left behind in this\ndigital age, developing countries should carefully balance between their conflicting needs of adopting\nmodern technology and preparing the basic foundation for economic development.\n7 A recent study by Pohjola (2000) investigated the relationship between IT investments and growth in 39 countries\nover the period 1980-1995. It found that, whereas such investments boosted growth in developed economies,\nthey were not beneficial in developing countries that lacked complementary policies.\n15", "ERD Working Paper No. 27\nDIGITAL DIVIDE: DETERMINANTS AND POLICIES WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO ASIA\nREFERENCES\nBresnahan, T., E.
