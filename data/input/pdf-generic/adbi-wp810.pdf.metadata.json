INTRODUCTION \n\nLee and Lee \n\nIn recent decades, rising income inequality has attracted attention. In many countries, \nalongside  income  growth,  income  inequality  has  increased  (Piketty  2014).  Many  East \nAsian  economies  that  have  achieved  the  \u201cmiracle\u201d  of  \u201cgrowth  with  equity\u201d  have  also \nwitnessed  the  deterioration  of  income  distribution  (Zhuang,  Kanbur,  and  Rhee  2014; \nJain-Chandra et al. 2016). \n\nHigh  income  inequality,  especially  that  originating  from  prevalent  inequality  of \nopportunities  in  a  society,  is  undesirable  from  the  perspective  of  social  justice. \nFurthermore,  unfair  income  distribution  can  be  harmful  to  sustainable  economic  \ngrowth.  Higher  inequality  provides  fewer  education  opportunities  for  talented  yet \nunderprivileged  individuals  and  discourages  investment  by  making  a  society  more \nunstable.  Hence,  all  states  endeavor  to  ensure  basic  livelihoods  for  the  poor  and \ndisadvantaged by building social security systems and to reduce inequalities in wealth \nand income by adopting redistribution policies.  \n\nResearch  often  emphasizes  human  capital  as  one  of  the  major  factors  affecting  the \ndegree  of  income  inequality.  Human  capital,  measured  by  the  educational  attainment \nembodied in a worker, is a major determinant of the worker\u2019s lifetime earnings. Parents \nconsider educational investment in their children as an important way to improve their \nchildren\u2019s future earnings. Many governments use higher spending on education as an \neffective  tool  for  reducing  educational  inequality  and  thus  income  inequality.  Despite \nthis  general  perception  of  and  interest  in  the  importance  of  education  for  income \ndistribution among the public and policy makers, the relationship between educational \nattainment and its distribution in populations experiencing income equality is not always \nclear in theoretical and empirical studies.1  \n\nRecently,  educational  attainment  has  been  expanding  and  educational  inequality  has \nbeen narrowing in many countries and regions, but at the same time income inequality \nhas  been  widening,  as  shown  in  section  3.  As  researchers  predict  increases  in  the \naverage  educational  attainment  and  educational  equality  to  lower  income  inequality, \nthis trend is puzzling. We must determine the exact contribution of education to income \ndistribution by assessing the roles of all the important factors in income distribution. For \nexample, during this recent period, rapid globalization and technological progress have \noccurred  worldwide.  While  many  studies  have  investigated  the  causes  of  income \ninequality,  none  have  yet  thoroughly  analyzed  the  exact  contribution  of  education  to \nincome inequality, especially in intertemporal, cross-national contexts.  \n\nAgainst this backdrop, this paper empirically analyzes the important factors for income \ninequality  across  countries  over  the  past  four  decades  and  determines  how  the  level \nand  distribution  of  educational  attainment  are  related  to  income  distribution.  We  also \nassess the way in which international trade, technological progress, and public policies \nsuch  as  social  benefits  and  expenditures  on  education  are  related  to  income  and \neducation distribution.  \n\nThe  remainder  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Section  2  briefly  reviews  the \nliterature  on  education  and  income  inequality.  Section  3  discusses  the  data  and \npresents stylized facts on the evolution of education and income inequality. In Section \n4, we analyze the determinants of income inequality using a panel data set covering a \nbroad range of countries for the period between 1980 and 2015. Using the regression \nresults,  we  discuss  the  role  of  educational  attainment  and  its  distribution  in  terms  of \n\n                                                 \n1   See the literature survey in section 2. \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 810 \n \n\nLee and Lee \n\nincome inequality. As an illustration, we also apply the results to East Asian economies \nand  establish  the  extent  to  which  education  and  other  major  determinants  have \ncontributed to the change in income inequality in recent decades. Section 5 analyzes \nthe  determinants  of  educational  inequality  and  discusses  how  educational  expansion \ncan affect educational inequality and thus income inequality. Section 6 concludes.  \n\n2.  LITERATURE REVIEW ON EDUCATION  \n\nAND INCOME INEQUALITY \n\nThe  human  capital  model  suggests  that  the  level  and  distribution  of  schooling  across \nthe  population  determines  the  distribution  of  earnings  (Becker  and  Chiswick  1966; \nMincer  1974).  Hence,  the  model  predicts  that  the  supply  and  demand  of  educated \npeople  influence  the  earnings  inequality  in  a  society.  While  the  model  predicts  an \nunambiguously  positive  association  between  educational  inequality,  as  measured  by \nthe  variance  of  schooling,  and  income  inequality,  the  effect  of  the  average  years  of \nschooling  on  income  inequality  may  be  either  positive  or  negative,  depending  on  the \nevolution of the rates of return on education. \n\nConsider the following human capital earnings function (De Gregorio and Lee 2002):  \n\n(1) \n\n(2) \n\n(3) \n\n\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc46 = \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc5c + \u2211 log\ufffd1 + \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc57\ufffd\n\n+ \ud835\udc62\nwhere Ys is the level of earnings with S level of schooling, rj is the rate of return on the \njth  year  or  level  of  schooling,  and  u  represents  other  non-school-related  factors  that \naffect earnings. The following can approximate this function:  \n\n\ud835\udc46\n\ud835\udc57=0\n\n \n\nTaking the variance yields the following earnings distribution function: \n\n\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc60 = \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc5c + \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc46 + \ud835\udc62\n\n \n\n2\n\n2\n\n\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc46) + \ud835\udc46\u0305\n\n\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc46) = \ud835\udc5f\u0305\n\n\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc5f) + 2\ud835\udc5f\u0305\ud835\udc46\u0305\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc63(\ud835\udc5f, \ud835\udc46) + \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc62)\n\nThis  implies  that  income  inequality  increases  unambiguously  with  educational \ninequality, Var(S), if controlling for other things. However, if the return on education, r, \ndecreases  with  educational  inequality,  the  relationship  can  be  ambiguous.  In  most \ncases,  however,  educational  inequality  and  the  wage  premium  for  higher  education \nwould  move  in  the  same  direction,  as  an  increase  in  the  supply  of  higher-educated \npeople  tends  to  lower  both  the  educational  inequality  and  the  wage  premium. \nMeanwhile, educational expansion, that is, an increase in S, leads to a more unequal \nincome distribution when r and S are independent. However, if the covariance between \nthe return on education and the level of education is negative, the relationship between \neducational expansion and income inequality can reduce income inequality. Since the \ncovariance  term  is  expected  to  be  negative,  the  relationship  between  educational \nexpansion and income inequality should be ambiguous.  \n\nWe  would  expect  educational  expansion,  S,  either  to  improve  or  to  deteriorate \neducational  distribution,  Var(S),  depending  on \nlevel  and  distribution  \n(De  Gregorio  and  Lee  2002).  In  a  society  in  which  only  a  small  fraction  of  the \npopulation  has  received  formal  education,  the  average  educational  attainment  is  low \nand the educational inequality is high. With an expansion of educational attainment, the \nlevel  of  educational  inequality  would  increase  if  the  more  educated  people  received  \n\ninitial \n\nits \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 810 \n \n\nLee and Lee \n\na  higher  level  of  education,  but  it  would  decrease  if  the  uneducated  people  received \nsome education.  \n\nKnight and Sabot (1983) suggest that educational expansion has an ambiguous effect \non income distribution. They show that educational expansion has two offsetting effects \non income distribution: the \u201ccomposition effect,\u201d whereby wage inequality rises initially, \nwhen  the  educational  expansion  leads  to  an  increase  in  the  proportion  of  more \neducated workers; and the \u201cwage compression effect,\u201d implying that, when the supply \nof  educated  labor  exceeds  the  demand  as  a  result  of  educational  expansion,  the \npremium for educated workers will eventually diminish and thereby wage inequality will \ndecline.  \n\nThe  empirical  literature  studying  the  relationship  between  education  and  income \ninequality  using  cross-country  data  often  presents  contradictory  results.  It  commonly \nuses two measures of educational inequality: the standard deviation of schooling (Ram \n1990;  Lam  and  Levinson  1991;  De  Gregorio  and  Lee  2002)  and  the  education  Gini \ncoefficient (Checchi 2001; Thomas, Wang, and Fan 2002). \n\nSeveral studies, including those by Park (1997) and De Gregorio and Lee (2002), find \nthat  greater  educational  dispersion  has  an  unequalizing  effect  on  income  distribution \nwhile  higher  educational  attainment  has  an  equalizing  effect  on  income  distribution. \nJaumotte,  Lall,  and  Papageorgiou  (2013)  show  that  income  inequality decreases with \nthe  average  years  of  schooling.  However,  holding  the  average  education  constant, \nincome  inequality  tends  to  increase  as  the  share  of  the  population  with  secondary  or \ntertiary education increases.  \n\nConversely,  Ram  (1984)  finds  no  adverse  effect  of  educational  inequality  on  income \ndistribution,  while  higher  educational  attainment  appears  to  have  a  mild  equalizing \neffect.  F\u00f6ldv\u00e1ri  and  van  Leeuwen  (2011)  also  identify  an  insignificant  effect  of \nschooling  inequality  on  income  inequality.  Checchi  (2001)  confirms  that  educational \nachievement  has  a  strong  negative  impact  on  income  inequality.  Furthermore,  a  U-\nshaped relationship between educational inequality and  income inequality is apparent \nwhen controlling for educational attainment.  \n\nCross-country studies also show a negative and nonlinear relationship between years \nof  schooling  and  educational  inequality  (Ram  1990;  De  Gregorio  and  Lee  2002; \nThomas, Wang, and Fan 2002), indicating that educational inequality increases as the \naverage level of schooling increases but starts to decline after reaching a peak. \n\nLim  and  Tang  (2008)  suggest  that  it  is  possible  to  measure  human  capital  inequality \nusing  the  distribution  of  the  Mincerian-type  measure  of  human  capital  rather  than  the \naverage  years  of  schooling.  They  show  that  the  measure  of  human  capital  inequality \nhas  an  inverted  U-shaped  relation  with  the  average  years  of  schooling  as  well  as \neducational inequality. Castell\u00f3-Climent and Dom\u00e9nech (2017) find that the distribution \nof Mincerian-type human capital has a positive relation with income distribution.  \n\nThe findings of the existing studies using  micro-level data are also  broadly consistent \nwith those of cross-country studies. Overall, educational inequality has an unequalizing \neffect on income distribution, while educational expansion has an ambiguous effect on \nincome distribution.  \n\nKatz  and  Murphy  (1992)  show  that  changes  in  the  relative  earnings  of  college \ngraduates, which were related to fluctuations in the supply of college graduates and a \nstrong demand for skilled workers, could explain the changes in the wage structure in \nthe United States in the period from 1963 to 1987. Goldin and Katz (2009) show that a \nslowdown  in  education  caused  much  of  the  increase  in  US  wage  inequality  in  the \nrecent period. The premium for higher education and skills has also risen across many \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 810 \n \n\nLee and Lee \n\ndeveloped countries in recent decades, contributing substantially to the rise in earnings \ninequality (Autor 2014). \n\nA  substantial  body  of  literature  also  analyzes  the  change  in  the  labor  demand  and \nsupply  and  wage  inequality  in  developing  countries  using  micro-level  data.  Since  the \nmid-1990s,  the  average  returns  on  an  additional  year  of  schooling  have  increased \nsignificantly in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) (Fleisher and Wang 2004; Zhang \net  al.  2005;  Fang  et  al.  2012).  In  urban  India,  wage  inequality  has  increased  since  \nthe start of the economic reform in 1991, mainly owing to increases in the returns on \nskills  (Kijima  2006).  Lee  and  Wie  (2017)  show  that  the  rapid  development  in  the  \nPRC  and  India  was  associated  with  an  increase  in  the  relative  wage  of  workers  with \nhigher education. \n\nCase  studies  on  income  distribution  dynamics  in  three  East  Asian  countries\u2014\nIndonesia,  Malaysia,  and  the  PRC\u2014and  four  in  Latin  America\u2014Argentina,  Brazil, \nColombia, and Mexico\u2014observe that, while the mean years of schooling rose and the \nschooling  level  became  more  equal  among  the  working-age  population  during  the \nperiod studied, income inequality also rose in most economies, except in Brazil, where \nthe  distribution  improved  slightly  (Bourguignon,  Ferreira,  and  Lustig  2004).  They  find \nthat  changes  in  the  distribution  of  education  also  had  an  overall  unequalizing  effect  \non  household  income,  except  in  Brazil  and  Taipei,China.  For  example,  the  greater \nimprovement  in  education  among  high-income  groups  had  the  greatest  unequalizing \neffect  on  household  income  in  Indonesia.  Conversely,  in  the  case  of  Taipei,China, \neducation  increased  substantially  such  that  the  average  schooling  among  poor \nhouseholds also improved, and, as a result, inequality in education fell. Meanwhile, the \nrising  trend  of  inequality  in  Latin  American  countries  reversed  from  the  mid-1990s. \nLustig,  Lopez-Calva,  and  Ortiz-Juarez  (2013)  explain  that  the  decline  in  labor  income \ninequality  was  associated  with  higher  education  and,  consequently,  with  more  equal \neducational distribution.  \n\nUsing  a  microeconometric  decomposition  method  and  comparing  the  distributions  of \nhousehold  incomes  between  the  United  States  and  Brazil  in  1999,  Bourguignon, \nFerreira, and Leite (2008) find that educational distribution is important in explaining the \ndifferences in household income distribution between the two countries.  \n\n3.  EVOLUTION OF EDUCATION  \nAND INCOME INEQUALITY  \n\nChallenges  of  data  comparability  confront  the  analysis  of  income  inequality  for \nintertemporal, cross-country comparison. We rely on the Gini index of net income (that \nis,  post-tax,  post-transfer)  taken  from  the  Standardized  World  Income  Inequality \nDatabase (SWIID) that Frederik Solt (2016) compiled. This data set provides measures \nof income inequality with reasonable comparability for the broad range of countries in \nthe  world  since  1960.  Since  the  database  provides  more  observations  from  1980 \nonwards, our analysis focuses on the period from 1980 to 2015.  \n\nWe  compile  the  net  income  equality  of  countries  and  economies  since  1980.  We  use \nfive-year averages, such as 1980\u201384, 1985\u201389, \u2026, and 2010\u201314 to reduce the short-\nterm  variations  as  well  as  the  possible  measurement  errors.  Figure  1  presents  the \ntrend of income equality by major regions, using the unweighted averages for the panel \nof  60  countries  that  have  complete  observations  at  five-year  intervals.  The  regions \nconsist of \u201cadvanced countries\u201d and six \u201cdeveloping regions\u201d: East Asia/Pacific, Eastern \nEurope/Central  Asia,  Latin  America/Caribbean,  Middle  East/North  Africa,  South  Asia, \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 810 \n \n\nLee and Lee \n\nand  Sub-Saharan  Africa.2 The  figure  shows  that  the  advanced  countries  and  Eastern \nEuropean countries, on average, have maintained considerably more equal distribution \nof  income  than  countries  from  other  developing  regions  throughout  the  period  have. \nThe  levels  of  income  inequality  in  Latin  America  and  Sub-Saharan  African  countries \nhave  been  higher  than  those  in  other  regions  but  have  followed  declining  trends  in \nrecent  decades.  In  contrast,  income  inequality  in  the  East  Asian  countries  has  been \nrelatively low but has risen in recent decades.  \n\nFigure 1: Trends of the Net Income Gini Coefficient from 1980\u201384 to 2010\u201314  \nfor a Balanced Panel of 60 Economies \n\n \n\nFigure 2 presents data for 16 individual economies in the East and South Asian regions. \nWe observe that most Asian economies have experienced increasing income inequality \nin  recent  decades.  The  Gini  coefficient  of  net  income  has  worsened  in  12  East  and \nSouth Asian economies. From the late 1980s to the mid-2010s, it increased from 0.34 \nto  0.51  in  the  PRC,  from  0.38  to  0.45  in  Indonesia,  and  from  0.28  to  0.31  in  the \nRepublic of Korea. During the same period, it also rose from 0.43 to 0.48 in India and \nfrom 0.34 to 0.40 in Bangladesh. In contrast, four Asian economies, including Malaysia \nand the Philippines, have reduced their income inequality in recent decades. Figure 3 \npresents  the  changes  in  income  inequality  measured  by  the  Gini  coefficient  of  net \nincome in the selected economies in other regions.  \n\nFor  the  measure  of  human  capital,  we  use  the  average  years  of  schooling  for  the \nworking-age population that Barro and Lee (2013, 2015) constructed. The most recent \nBarro\u2012Lee  data  set  provides  estimates  of  educational  attainment  for  the  populations  \nof 146 countries, disaggregated by gender and five-year age group, from 1950 to 2015 \nat  five-year  intervals.  The  data  set  distinguishes  between  seven  different  levels  \nof  education:  no  formal  education,  incomplete  primary,  complete  primary,  lower \nsecondary, upper secondary, incomplete tertiary, and complete tertiary. We use these \ndata to calculate the average years of schooling among the adult population both as a \nwhole and at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. \n\n \n                                                 \n2   See Appendix Table 1 for a list of the countries included in each region/group. \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 810 \n \n\nLee and Lee \n\nFigure 2: Trends of Income Inequality in East and South Asian Economies  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 810 \n \n\nLee and Lee \n\nFigure 3: Trends of Income Inequality in Selected Economies  \nof Other Groups/Regions \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 810 \n \n\nLee and Lee \n\nWe construct the average number of years of schooling for the population aged 15\u201364, \nS, as:  \n\n \n\n(4) \n\n\ud835\udc4e\n\n\ud835\udc4e\n\n\ud835\udc4e\n\n)\n\n\ud835\udc46\n\n\ud835\udc4e\n\ud835\udc46\n\n\ud835\udc4e\n\ud835\udc57\n\u2211 \u210e\ud835\udc57\n\n\ud835\udc4e\n\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc57\n\n\ud835\udc34\n\ud835\udc4e=1\n  = \u2211 \ud835\udc59\n\n\ud835\udc34\n\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61 = \u2211 \ud835\udc59\n\ud835\udc4e=1\n(\n is the population share of five-year age group \n is the number of years of schooling of age group \n\ud835\udc4e\n\ud835\udc59\n\nwhere \nand \nyears  of  schooling  of  age  group \nattained  the  educational  level \n(\n\n\ud835\udc4e\n as  the  sum  of  the  fraction  of  group \n\n in the working-age population \n.

EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF INCOME INEQUALITY  \n\nThis section explores the major factors that can explain income inequality for a broad \nnumber  of  countries  over  three  decades.  The  empirical  strategy  is  to  identify  the \nrelationship between  educational  variables  and income  inequality  when  controlling  for \nother important determinants of income inequality. \n\nThe following represents the empirical framework:  \n\n2\n\n,  \n\n+ \ud835\udefd3 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc3c,\ud835\udc61   +\n\n(6) \n\n\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc3c,\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udefd0 + \ud835\udefd1 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54\ufffd\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61\ufffd + \ud835\udefd2 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54\ufffd\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61\ufffd\n\ud835\udefd4 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3c,\ud835\udc61 +  \ud835\udefd5\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc56, + \u0275\ud835\udc61, + \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61 \n\n is the country\u2019s per capita income and \n\nwhere \nand  policy  variables  that  influence  country \nincludes period dummies.  \n\n\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\n\n\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\n\n denotes a group of environmental \n\u2019s  income  inequality.  The  specification \n\nThe  regression  applies  to  a  panel  set  of  cross-country  data  for  95  economies  over \nseven five-year periods from 1980 to 2014, corresponding to 1980\u20131984, 1985\u20131989, \n1990\u20131994,  1995\u20131999,  2000\u20132004,  2005-2009,  and  2010-2014. 3  The  dependent \nvariable is the net Gini coefficient of income distribution, averaged over each period.  \n\n\ud835\udc56\n\n \n\n                                                 \n3   The sample is an unbalanced panel of 95 economies, because many economies have incomplete data \non  income  inequality  in  the  1980s.  The  main  results  reported  here  are  robust  when  the  sample  is \nrestricted to the balanced panel of 59 countries that have complete data. \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 810 \n \n\nLee and Lee \n\nThe basic specification controls for the log of per capita GDP and its square to capture \nthe Kuznets inverted-U curve for the relationship between the income distribution and \nthe level of income (Kuznets 1955). We want to assess the effect of education factors, \nindependently from per capita income, on income inequality. For the environmental and \npolicy  variables,  we  consider  trade  openness,  inflation,  fiscal  policy  (government \nconsumption and social benefits), a democracy indicator, and technological progress.  \n\nWe  measure  trade  openness  using  the  ratio  of  exports  plus  imports  to  the  GDP. \nTheoretically  and  empirically,  we  consider  international  trade  to  influence  income \ninequality.  According  to  a  Heckscher\u2012Ohlin  trade  model,  when  it  opens  up  to  trade,  \na  country  with  abundant  low-skilled  labor  will  experience  an  increase  in  the  relative \nwage of unskilled workers, thus reducing wage inequality. However, if trade transmits \nskill-biased  technological  change  to  developing  countries,  increased  trade  openness \ncould cause higher wage inequality by shifting the labor demand towards more skilled \nworkers.  The  evidence  suggests  that  trade  liberalization  has  a  significant  effect  on \nwage inequality through its impact on the adoption of new skill-intensive technologies \n(Berman, Bound, and Machin 1998; Bourguignon, Ferreira, and Lustig 2004; Lee and \nWie 2015).4  \n\nWe  expect  inflation  (measured  using  changes  in  the  consumer  price  index  over  five-\nyear intervals) to worsen income distribution. Inflation tends to decrease the real wage \nand  redistribute  income  from  wage  earners  to  profit  takers,  which  can  deteriorate \nincome distribution. Easterly and Fisher (2001) find that high inflation tends to reduce \nthe  share  of  the  bottom  quintile  and  the  real  minimum  wage,  increasing  income \ninequality.  As  inflation  is  a  tax  on  cash  balances,  it  can  disproportionately  hurt  poor \nhouseholds,  whose  wealth  is  mostly  held  in  liquid  assets  such  as  currency,  thereby \nincreasing inequality (Albanesi 2007). \n\nWe  also  add  democracy  as  a  determinant  of  income  inequality.  For  nondemocratic \nregimes,  in  which  political  power  is  concentrated  within  a  narrow  segment  of  the \nsociety,  we  expect  income  inequality  to  be  higher.  Democratic  institutions,  by  shifting \nthe median voter towards poorer people, can increase redistributive activities, reducing \nincome  inequality.  On  the  other  hand,  democracy  can  cater  to  the  preferences  of  the \nricher  population  or  the  middle  class,  thus  exacerbating  inequality  (Acemoglu  et  al. \n2015).  The  empirical  evidence  does  not  support  a  strong  effect  of  democracy  on \nincome inequality. However, it appears to support the idea that democracy influences \nincome  inequality  through  the  indirect  channels  of  the  tax  rate  and  education \n(Acemoglu  et  al.  2015).  As  the  measure  of  democracy,  we  use  the  Freedom  House \nPolitical Rights Index (converted from seven categories into a scale from zero to one, \nwith higher values representing the increasing presence of political rights). \n\nFiscal  policy  is  an  important  factor  that  influences  income  distribution.  We  expect \nredistributive  policies  to  reduce  income  inequality  (Benabou  2000;  De  Gregorio  \nand  Lee  2002).  The  effect  of  overall  government  expenditures  on  income  distribution \nmust  depend  on  composition,  coverage,  and  targeting.  We  consider  the  extent  of \ngovernment consumption, defined as the ratio of government consumption to the GDP, \nas a fiscal policy variable. We also use social benefit expenditure, which includes direct \ntransfers  to  the  poor  for  unemployment  compensation,  social  security  pensions,  and \n\n                                                 \n4   We  also  consider  financial  openness  as  a  potential  driver  of  income  inequality,  but  it  turns  out  to  be \n\nstatistically insignificant. \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 810 \n \n\nLee and Lee \n\nthe provision of medical services, as another fiscal policy variable redistributing income \nfrom rich to poor.5  \n\nThe  principal  link  between  technology  and  income  inequality  is  the  channel  of  \nskill-biased technical change. Technological change, which causes a relative demand \nshift favoring those with a high level of education, increases the relative wage of more-\neducated workers relative to under-educated workers. A difficulty arises regarding the \naccurate measurement of technological change. In this study, we adopt two measures, \nconsidering  data  availability:  the  number  of  patents  and  the  share  of  high-technology \nexports  in  the  total  manufactured  exports.  The  number  of  patents  is  the  total  number  \nof  applications  filed  by  \u201capplicant\u2019s  origin\u201d  under  the  World  Intellectual  Property \nOrganization  (WIPO)\u2019s  Patent  Cooperation  Treaty  (WIPO  2016).  High-technology \nexports  are  products  with  high  research  and  development  (R&D)  intensity,  such  as \nthose  in  aerospace,  computers,  electrical  machinery,  pharmaceuticals,  and  scientific \ninstruments (World Bank 2017).  \n\nFigures  12  and  13  present  the  trends  of  trade  openness  and  technological  progress, \nrespectively, for each region from 1980 to 2015 for the sample of countries that have \ncomplete information. The numbers are unweighted averages for the countries in each \nregion.  Trade  openness  shows  significant  variation  across  regions.  It  has  been  high \nand  risen  fast  on  average  in  advanced  economies  and  East  Asian  economies.  The \nmeasures of technological progress also show significant regional variations but have \nbeen high in advanced economies and East Asian economies. \n\nFigure 12: Trends of Trade Openness by Region  \nfor a Balanced Sample of 123 Economies \n\n                                                 \n5   We  also  consider  public  education  appending  as  another  fiscal  variable  that  can  influence  income \ndistribution,  but  it  turns  out  to  be  statistically  insignificant.  However,  spending  on  education  has  a \nsignificantly positive effect on educational equality, as shown in Section 5. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 810 \n \n\nLee and Lee \n\nFigure 13: Trends of Technology by Region, Unbalanced Sample \n\n \n\nWe  estimate  this  system  of  seven  equations  in  (6)  with  country  fixed  effects.  The  \nfixed-effects  estimation  controls  for  possible  bias  when  unobserved  and  persistent \ncountry  characteristics  that  influence  the  income  Gini  variable  correlate  with  the \nexplanatory variables. To reduce the reverse causality, we use per capita income and \neducational variables at the beginning of the period. For other policy variables, we use \nthe  values  for  the  contemporaneous  period  corresponding  to  the  income  distribution \nvariable.  However,  considering  that  the  reverse  causality  from  income  distribution  to \nour  environmental  and  policy  measures  may  cause  biased  estimates,  we  also  adopt \ninstrumental  variable  (IV)  estimation  techniques.  The  IV  estimation  uses  lagged  \nvalues  of  policy  variables  as  instruments.  Note  that  it  is  practically  difficult  to  adopt \ninstrumental  variable  estimation  techniques  by  constructing  a  set  of  fully  convincing \nexogenous instruments in this panel structure.  \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 810 \n \n\nLee and Lee \n\nRegression (1) of Table 1 presents the estimation results of the basic specification (6) \nusing  income,  education,  and  four  policy  variables  (namely  trade  openness,  inflation, \ndemocracy,  and  government  consumption)  with  country  fixed  effects.  The  sample \nincludes 608 observations for seven periods for 95 countries.  \n\nThe estimates of per capita GDP support the nonlinear effects of per capita income that \nthe Kuznets curve proposes. The coefficients of per capita GDP and its square terms \nare  positive  and  negative,  respectively.  The  estimates  are  individually  and  jointly \nstatistically  significant,  but  the  square  term  is  only  marginally  significant.  This \nconfiguration  of  coefficients  indicates  an  initial  increase  and  a  subsequent  decline  in \nthe  income  Gini  coefficient  with  log  per  capita  income  when  controlling  for  other \nvariables.  However,  the  estimated  coefficients\u2014the  linear  term  of  0.0672  and  the \nsquared  term  of  -0.0027\u2014imply  that  the  breakpoint  is  well  above  the  range  of  per \ncapita  income  in  the  sample.  Hence,  an  increase  in  income  tends  to  worsen  income \ninequality. According to the estimated coefficients, an increase of 1 standard deviation \n(1.16) at the mean (9.03 or $8,350) in the log per capita income leads to an increase in \nthe  income  Gini  coefficient  of  about  0.018  (that  is,  1.8  percentage  points),  which \naccounts for about 20% of the standard deviation of the Gini coefficient. \n\nEducational  inequality,  measured  by  the  Gini  coefficient  of  educational  attainment \namong  the  population,  has  a  significantly  positive  effect  on  income  inequality.  In \nregression  (4),  the  estimated  coefficient  (-0.089)  suggests  that  an  increase  in  the \neducation  Gini  coefficient  of  1  standard  deviation  (0.18)  increases  the  income  Gini \ncoefficient  by  about  0.016  (that  is,  1.6  percentage  points),  which  accounts  for  about  \n18% of the standard deviation of the Gini coefficient. \n\nIn  contrast,  educational  attainment  has  a  statistically  insignificant  effect  on  income \ninequality  when  controlling  for  other  variables,  including  per  capita  income  and \neducational  inequality.  Note  that,  as  long  as  educational  inequality  is  related  to  the \nlevel  of  educational  attainment,  the  average  level  of  educational  attainment  can  have \nan indirect effect on income inequality by changing educational inequality. We discuss \nthis issue in the next section.  \n\nWe  find  that  trade  openness  has  a  significantly  positive  impact  on  income  inequality. \nThe  estimated  coefficient  (0.017)  suggests  that  an  increase  in  the  international  \ntrade-to-GDP ratio of 0.56 (1 standard deviation) increases the Gini coefficient by about  \n1 percentage point. \n\nThe  positive  estimate  of  the  coefficient  of  inflation  also  supports  the  theoretical \nprediction.  The  estimated  coefficient  (0.019)  implies  that  an  increase  in  inflation  of  1 \nstandard  deviation  (1.42)  increases  the  income  Gini  coefficient  by  about  0.3 \npercentage  points.  Conversely,  democracy  and  government  consumption  are  not \nstatistically  significant  when  controlling  for  per  capita  income,  educational  inequality, \naverage educational attainment, and other policy variables. \n\n \n\n \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 810 \n \n\nLee and Lee \n\nTable 1: Regression Results for Income Inequality \n\n \n\n(1) \n\n(2) \n\n(3) \n\n(4) \n\n(5) \n\n(6) \n\n(7) \n\n(8) \n\nEstimation Technique \n\nPanel FE  Panel FE  Panel FE  Panel FE \n\nPanel FE \nIV \n\nPanel FE \nIV \n\nPanel FE \nIV \n\nPanel FE \nIV \n\nLog (per capita GDP) \n\n0.0672** \n\n0.0782*** \n\n0.0509 \n\n\u20130.0283 \n\n0.0424 \n\n0.0489* \n\n0.0393 \n\n\u20130.0989** \n\nLog (per capita GDP) \nsquared \n\n(0.0281) \n\n(0.0280) \n\n(0.0311) \n\n(0.0395) \n\n(0.0278) \n\n(0.0290) \n\n(0.0375) \n\n(0.0490) \n\n\u20130.0027* \n\n\u20130.0035** \n\n\u20130.0023 \n\n0.0008 \n\n\u20130.0014 \n\n\u20130.0021 \n\n\u20130.0018 \n\n0.0049* \n\n(0.0016) \n\n(0.0016) \n\n(0.0017) \n\n(0.0022) \n\n(0.0015) \n\n(0.0016) \n\n(0.00197) \n\n(0.0027) \n\nEducational inequality \n\n0.0893** \n\n0.0888** \n\n0.103** \n\n0.0658 \n\n0.101** \n\n0.111** \n\n0.148** \n\n0.0699 \n\n(0.0441) \n\n(0.0437) \n\n(0.0490) \n\n(0.0546) \n\n(0.0440) \n\n(0.0449) \n\n(0.0576) \n\n(0.0534) \n\nEducational attainment \n\n0.0002 \n\n0.0007 \n\n0.0023 \n\n\u20130.0035 \n\n0.0008 \n\n0.0024 \n\n0.00704* \n\n\u20130.0032 \n\n(0.0031) \n\n(0.0031) \n\n(0.0033) \n\n(0.0033) \n\n(0.0032) \n\n(0.0032) \n\n(0.0037) \n\n(0.0031) \n\nTrade openness/GDP \n\n0.0168***  0.0172*** \n\n0.0127** \n\n0.0050 \n\n0.0142** \n\n0.0152*** \n\n0.0118* \n\n0.0039 \n\nInflation \n\n0.0019** \n\n0.0017** \n\n0.0024*** \n\n0.0011* \n\n0.0021***  0.0020*** \n\n0.0028** \n\n0.0015** \n\n(0.0057) \n\n(0.0056) \n\n(0.0062) \n\n(0.0057) \n\n(0.0057) \n\n(0.0057) \n\n(0.0066) \n\n(0.0058) \n\nDemocracy indicator \n\n0.0042 \n\n0.0041 \n\n0.0118* \n\n0.0191*** \n\n\u20130.0004 \n\n\u20130.0004 \n\n0.0146 \n\n0.0194*** \n\n(0.0008) \n\n(0.0008) \n\n(0.0007) \n\n(0.0006) \n\n(0.0007) \n\n(0.0007) \n\n(0.0012) \n\n(0.0006) \n\nGovernment \nconsumption/GDP \n\nPatents  \n\nHigh-technology exports/ \nmanufacturing exports \n\nSocial spending/GDP \n\n(0.0060) \n\n(0.0060) \n\n(0.0069) \n\n(0.0063) \n\n(0.0064) \n\n(0.0065) \n\n(0.0096) \n\n(0.0071) \n\n\u20130.0206 \n\n\u20130.0242 \n\n0.0265 \n\n\u20130.0256 \n\n\u20130.0300 \n\n\u20130.0353 \n\n0.0436 \n\n0.0547 \n\n(0.0231) \n\n(0.0229) \n\n(0.0319) \n\n(0.0327) \n\n(0.0234) \n\n(0.0237) \n\n(0.0394) \n\n(0.0384) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.182*** \n\n(0.0384) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.0379* \n\n(0.0214) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u20130.0862* \n\n(0.0504) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.163*** \n\n(0.0383) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.0091 \n\n(0.0251) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u20130.101* \n\n(0.0553) \n\nN, N of country \nR2 \n\n608, 95 \n\n595, 93 \n\n460, 91 \n\n333, 71 \n\n578, 95 \n\n553, 93 \n\n369, 90 \n\n265, 67 \n\n0.131 \n\n0.167 \n\n0.156 \n\n0.305 \n\n0.103 \n\n0.148 \n\n0.128 \n\n0.338 \n\nNotes: Panel FE indicates panel regression with  country fixed effects and Panel FE IV uses values over the previous \nfive years or in the initial year of each period of the explanatory variables as instrumental variables (IVs). The regression \napplies  to  an  unbalanced  panel  data  set  for  95  economies  over  seven  five-year  periods  from  1980  to  2014.  The \ndependent  variable  is  the  net  income  Gini  coefficient,  averaged  over  each  period.  The  per  capita  GDP,  educational \ninequality,  and  educational  attainment  are  the  values  in  the  initial  year  of  each  period,  and  the  other  explanatory \nvariables are period averages. The specification includes period dummies. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance \nat the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively. \n\nRegression (2) of Table 1 adds the number of patents as a measure of technological \nprogress.6 The  sample  size  shrinks,  because  fewer  observations  of  this  variable  are \navailable.  The  estimation  result  shows  that,  when  controlling  for  other  explanatory \nvariables,  income  inequality  is  strongly  positively  associated  with  technological \ndevelopment.  The  estimated  coefficient  (0.146)  suggests  that  an  increase  in  the  log \nvalue of patents of 0.05 (1 standard deviation) increases the Gini coefficient by about \n0.9  percentage  points.  In  regression  (3),  income  inequality  is  also  positively,  though \nonly  marginally  statistically  significantly,  related  to  high-technology  exports,  which  is \nanother  measure  of  technological  development.  The  estimated  coefficient  of  high-\ntechnology  exports  (0.038)  suggests  that  an  increase  of  0.12  in  the  ratio  of  high-\ntechnology  exports  to  manufacturing  exports  increases  the  income  Gini  coefficient  by \nabout 0.5 percentage points.  \n\nRegression (4) of Table 1 adds government social benefits as an explanatory variable. \nBecause  the  sample  size  shrinks  substantially,  the  results  for  the  other  explanatory \nvariables  change  considerably.  Notably,  the  estimates  for  the  per  capita  income  \nand  educational  inequality  variables  become  statistically  insignificant.  Nevertheless, \nsocial  benefit  spending  has  a  significantly  negative  effect  on  income  inequality.  The \n\n                                                 \n6   The patent variable is the log value of (1+number of patents).  \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 810 \n \n\nLee and Lee \n\nestimated  coefficient  (\u20130.086)  indicates  that  an  increase  in  government  social \nexpenditures  of  0.07  (1  standard  deviation)  reduces  the  education  Gini  coefficient  by \nabout  0.6  percentage  points.  Interestingly,  democracy  enters  regressions  (3)  and  (4) \npositively  and  statistically  significantly  with  these  samples,  implying  that  a  democratic \nregime tends to be associated positively with activities that worsen income inequality, \nespecially when controlling for redistributive activities.  \n\nRegressions (5)\u2012(8) of Table 1 present the results from the IV estimation techniques to \ncontrol  for  the  endogeneity  of  the  policy  variables,  using  their  lagged  values  as  IVs. \nThe  use  of  lagged  values  as  instruments  reduces  the  number  of  observations  in  the \nearly  period  in  some  specifications.  The  table  shows  that  the  major  results  in \nregressions (1)\u2013(4) change very little in IV estimation.  \n\nTo  assess  the  effects  of  education  and  other  explanatory  variables  on  income \ndistribution  quantitatively,  we  decompose  the  evolution  of  income  inequality  in  the  \nEast Asian region. Researchers have seen many East Asian economies as examples \nof  \u201cgrowth  with  equity,\u201d  but  in  recent  decades  they  have  experienced  significant \ndeterioration of income distribution. Columns (1)\u2013(3) of Table 2 show the actual values \nof  the  income  Gini  coefficient  and  all  the  explanatory  variables  for  1985\u201389  and  \n2010\u201314  and  the  differences  between  the  two  periods  for  the  average  of  eight \neconomies that have complete data: the PRC; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Malaysia; \nthe Philippines; the Republic of Korea; Singapore; and Thailand. Columns (1)\u2013(3) show \nthe actual values of the income Gini coefficient and all the explanatory  variables. The \nactual  average  values  were  0.396  and  0.429  for  1985\u201389  and  2010\u201314,  respectively, \nand  increased  by  3.3  percentage  points  over  25  years  in  East  Asia.  Using  the \nregression result in column (2) of Table 1, we construct the values of the income Gini \ncoefficient  that  each  explanatory  variable  predicts  for  each  period  and  the  difference \nbetween  the  two  periods.  The  model-based  predicted  values  of  the  income  Gini \ncoefficient  in  1985\u201389  and  2010\u201314  were  about  2  percentage  points  lower  than  the \nactual values and increased by 2.8 percentage points between the two periods.  \n\nColumn  (4)  of  Table  2  shows  the  extent  to  which  the  change  in  each  explanatory \nvariable  contributes  to  the  predicted  change  in  the  income  Gini  coefficient  of  2.8 \npercentage  points  over  the  period  in  the  region.  We  find  that  the  per  capita  income \nincrease played an important role, contributing 1.6 percentage points. Trade openness \nand  technological  progress  also  made  significant  contributions  of  about  1.0  and  1.5 \npercentage points,  respectively.  More  equal  distribution  of education counterbalanced \nthese  unequalizing  effects  by  reducing  the  income  Gini  coefficient  by  as  much  as  \n1.5  percentage  points.  However,  an  increase  in  educational  attainment  had  a \ndeteriorating effect on income distribution of about 0.3 percentage points.7  \n\nWe  can  also  gauge  the  role  of  social  benefits  in  explaining  the  change  in  income \ninequality.  During  this  period,  the  share  of  social  benefits  in  the  GDP  increased  from \n0.7% to 2.9% on average in East Asian economies. Using the estimated coefficient of \nsocial benefits in column (4) of Table 1, we estimate the increase in government social \nspending  to  have  contributed  to  reducing  income  inequality  by  about  0.2  percentage \npoints. Hence, the small increase in social benefits had only a minor impact on income \ndistribution in East Asia. If social spending had increased to 10% of the GDP, the world \naverage, it would have decreased the income Gini coefficient by 0.8 percentage points, \nas much as education factors.  \n\n                                                 \n7   Note that educational expansion can have an indirect effect on income inequality through its effect on \neducational inequality. According to the estimation result in the next section, a 3.5-year increase in the \naverage  schooling  years  in  East  Asia  over  1985\u201389  and  2010\u201314  would  have  a  significantly  positive \neffect on educational distribution and thus income distribution. \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 810 \n \n\nLee and Lee \n\nIncome Gini \nChange Explained \nby Each Factor \n\nTable 2: Explaining the Change in Income Inequality in East Asia \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIncome Gini \n  Actual \n   (Predicted)  \nDeterminants \n  Log per capita GDP \n  Log per capita GDP squared \n  Educational inequality \n  Educational attainment \n  Trade openness \n  Inflation \n  Democracy indicator \n  Government consumption \n  Patents \n\n(1) \n\n1985\u201289 \n \n\n0.396 \n(0.379) \n\n \n\n8.615 \n\n74.80 \n\n0.369 \n6.62 \n0.802 \n0.060 \n0.415 \n0.168 \n0.001 \n\nActual Values \n\n(2) \n\n(3) \n\n2010\u201214 \n\nChange \n\n \n\n \n\n0.429 \n(0.407) \n\n \n\n9.795 \n\n96.68 \n\n0.205 \n\n10.1 \n\n1.370 \n0.034 \n0.473 \n0.124 \n0.082 \n\n0.033 \n(0.028) \n\n \n\n1.180 \n\n21.88 \n\u20130.165 \n3.48 \n0.568 \n\u20130.026 \n0.058 \n\u20130.044 \n0.080 \n\n(4) \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n0.0158 \n\n\u20130.0146 \n0.0026 \n0.0098 \n\u20130.0001 \n0.0002 \n0.0011 \n0.0146 \n\nNotes: We use the regression result in column (2) of Table 1 to calculate the predicted values of income inequality, on \naverage, for the group of eight East Asian economies consisting of the PRC; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Malaysia; \nthe Philippines; the Republic of Korea; Singapore; and Thailand. Columns (1)\u2013(3) show the actual values of the income \nGini coefficient and all the explanatory variables for 1985\u201389 and 2010\u201314 and their changes between the two periods, \nand column (4) contains the predicted change in income inequality between 1985\u201389 and 2010\u201314 using the regression \nresult in column (2) of Table 1. The value of per capita GDP includes both level and square terms. \n\nIn sum, economic growth, trade openness, and technological progress are three major \nfactors  that  have  led  to  the  deterioration  of  income  distribution  in  East  Asia  in  recent \ndecades.  The  unequalizing  effects  of  these  factors  on  income  distribution  have \nsurpassed the income-equalizing effects of educational equality and government social \nexpenditures.  Improvements  in  the  level  and  distribution  of  education  are  important \nfactors that have counterbalanced the forces of deteriorating income distribution. \n\n5.  EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF EDUCATIONAL \n\nINEQUALITY  \n\nThe  previous  section shows  that  income  inequality  is  positively  related  to  educational \ninequality. In this section, we analyze the determinants of educational inequality. \n\nThe empirical framework is represented by:  \n\n \n\n \n\n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc3c,\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udefd0 + \ud835\udefd1 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54\ufffd\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61\u22121\ufffd + \ud835\udefd2 \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc3c,\ud835\udc61\u22121 +\n\ud835\udefd3 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3c,\ud835\udc61\u22121 + \ud835\udefd4 \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61\u22121 + \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc56, + \u0275\ud835\udc61, + \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61 \n\nThe  regression  applies  to  a  panel  set  of  cross-country  data  for  95  economies  at  \nfive-year  intervals  from  1985  to  2015.  The  dependent  variable  is  the  Gini  coefficient  \nof  educational  distribution  for  1985,  1990,  1995,  2000,  2005,  2010,  and  2015.  This \nsystem  of  seven  equations  in  (7)  is  estimated  with  country  fixed  effects.  To  reduce  \nthe reverse causality, we use one-period lagged values for per capita income and the \neducational attainment variables and averaged values over the previous five years for \n\n(7) \n\n19 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 810 \n \n\nLee and Lee \n\nthe environmental and policy variables. Because school enrollments and other factors \nin much earlier periods determine the distribution of educational attainment among the \nadult population, the endogeneity issue is less of a concern. The regression includes a \nlagged  value  of  income  inequality  to  identify  the  possible  impact  from  income \ndistribution on educational distribution.  \n\nWe  use  public  spending  on  education,  instead  of  social  benefits  (which  turns  out  \nto  be  statistically  insignificant),  as  a  fiscal  policy  variable.  We  expect  spending  on \neducation  to  help  the  poor  to  gain  access  to  education,  thereby  contributing  to \neducation  equality,  especially  when  credit  markets  are  imperfect  (Benabou  2000;  \nDe Gregorio and Lee 2002).  \n\nTable 3: Regression Results for Educational Inequality \n\n \n \n\nLog (per capita GDP) \n\nIncome Gini \n\nEducational attainment \n\nTrade openness/GDP \n\nInflation \n\nDemocracy indicator \n\nGovernment \nconsumption/GDP \n\nPatents  \n\nHigh-technology exports/ \nmanufacturing exports \n\nEducation spending/GDP \n\nCountry fixed effect \nN, N of country \nR2 \n\n(1) \nPanel FE \n0.0191*** \n(0.0061) \n0.0819 \n(0.0556) \n\u20130.0354*** \n(0.0026) \n0.0311*** \n(0.0070) \n0.0008 \n(0.0010) \n0.0035 \n(0.0075) \n0.166*** \n(0.0271) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYes \n608, 95 \n0.820 \n\n(2) \nPanel FE \n0.0188*** \n(0.0062) \n0.0704 \n(0.0574) \n\u20130.0355*** \n(0.0027) \n0.0316*** \n(0.0071) \n0.0008 \n(0.0010) \n0.0034 \n(0.0076) \n0.166*** \n(0.0274) \n0.0397 \n(0.0498) \n \n \n \n \nYes \n595 93 \n0.818 \n\n(3) \nPanel FE \n0.0136 \n(0.0090) \n0.103 \n(0.0757) \n\u20130.0322*** \n(0.0032) \n0.0248*** \n(0.0090) \n0.0013 \n(0.0010) \n\u20130.0058 \n(0.0010) \n0.175*** \n(0.0438) \n \n \n\u20130.0375 \n(0.0309) \n \n \nYes \n460, 91 \n0.765 \n\n(4) \nPanel FE \n0.0223*** \n(0.0065) \n0.102 \n(0.0647) \n\u20130.0356*** \n(0.0027) \n0.0337*** \n(0.0077) \n0.0016 \n(0.0013) \n0.0058 \n(0.0083) \n0.162*** \n(0.0314) \n \n \n \n \n\u20130.0034** \n(0.0017) \nYes \n506, 94 \n0.806 \n\nNotes:  The  system  consists  of  seven  equations  that  apply  to  an  unbalanced  panel  data  set  for  95  economies.

The  estimated  coefficient  of  the  income  level  is  statistically \nsignificant  and  positive.  Hence,  increases  in  per  capita  income  over  time  tend  to \nincrease  educational  inequality.  The  estimated  coefficient  (0.019)  suggests  that  an \nincrease  in  log  per  capita  income  of  1  standard  deviation  (1.16)  increases  the \neducation  Gini  coefficient  by  2.2  percentage  points.  However,  income  inequality  is \nstatistically insignificant.  \n\nThe  regression  result  shows  a  strong  negative  effect  of  educational  attainment  on \nincome  inequality.  The  estimated  coefficient  of  educational  attainment  (\u20130.035) \nsuggests  that  an  increase  in  the  average  schooling  of  about  3  years  (amounting  to  \n1  standard  deviation)  decreases  the  education  Gini  coefficient  by  about  0.11  (that  is,  \n11 percentage points), which accounts for about 60% of the standard deviation of the \neducation  Gini  coefficient.  Therefore,  the  increase  in  educational  attainment  is  the \nmajor driver improving the education Gini coefficient. According to the result in Table 1, \na decrease in the education Gini coefficient of 0.11 reduces the income Gini coefficient \nby about 1 percentage point. Hence, an increase in the level of educational attainment \ncan  contribute  significantly  to  reducing  income  inequality  through  the  channel  of \nchange in educational inequality. \n\nIn  Regression  (1),  the  coefficient  of  trade  openness  is  significantly  positive.  The \nestimated  coefficient  (0.031)  suggests  that  an  increase  in  international  trade  of  0.56  \n(1 standard deviation) increases the education Gini coefficient by about 1.7 percentage \npoints. Government consumption is also significantly positive. The estimated coefficient \n(0.166)  suggests  that  an  increase  in  government  consumption  of  0.07  (1  standard \ndeviation)  increases  the  education  Gini  coefficient  by  about  1.2  percentage  points. \nConversely, inflation and democracy are not statistically significant. The positive effects \nof trade openness and government consumption on educational inequality, controlling \nfor income and educational attainment variables, seem to suggest that the distribution \nof  education  among  the  population  tends  to  become  more  uneven,  for  instance  by \ndisproportionally  increasing  the  schooling  years  of  higher-educated  people  when  an \neconomy  increases  its  openness  to  international  trade  or  the  size  of  government \nconsumption.  \n\nRegressions  (2)\u2013(3)  include  technology  variables.  In  contrast  to  the  regressions  of \nincome inequality, there is no significant effect of technological development, measured \nusing  either  the  number  of  patents  or  the  number  of  high-technology  exports,  on \neducational inequality.  \n\nRegression  (4)  adds  government  spending  on  education  as  an  explanatory  variable. \nThe  coefficient  of  spending  on  education  is  negative,  implying  that  higher  public \nexpenditure on education helps to decrease the inequality of schooling. The estimated \ncoefficient  (-0.0034)  suggests  that  an  increase  in  government  spending  on  education  \nof  0.016  (1  standard  deviation)  reduces  the  education  Gini  coefficient  by  about  \n0.5 percentage points. The results for the other explanatory variables in this regression \nremain quite similar to those in Regression (1). \n\nThe results in Tables 1 and 3 show that public policies are effective in reducing income \ninequality.  Government  social  expenditure  helps  to  reduce  income  inequality,  and \nspending  on  education  can  reduce  the  dispersion  of  education  and  thereby  income \ninequality.  \n\n21 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 810 \n \n\nLee and Lee \n\n6.  CONCLUDING REMARKS  \n\nThis paper provides evidence that human capital, measured by educational attainment, \nplays an important role in income distribution. The regressions using panel data for a \nbroad range of countries for the period between 1980 and 2015 show that more equal \ndistribution  of  education  has  contributed  significantly  to  reducing  income  inequality.  \nAn  increase  in  educational  attainment  reduces  educational  inequality  and  thus  helps  \nto  reduce  income  inequality.  The  empirical  results  also  show  that  we  can  attribute  \nthe  rising  income  inequality  in  many  economies  in  recent  decades  to  a  fast  income \nincrease,  trade  expansion,  and  rapid  technological  progress.  Reduced  educational \ninequality is an important factor that counterbalanced these income-unequalizing forces \nover  the  period.  We  also  find  that  increased  social  benefit  expenditures  and  lower \ninflation  contributed  to  making  income  distribution  more  equal.  Increased  public \nspending on education also played an important role in improving education distribution \nand thus income distribution.  \n\nUnderstanding  the  impact  of  education,  globalization,  and  technological  changes  on \nincome  distribution  is  important  to  design  and  implement  deliberate  policies  towards \nmore  inclusive  and  sustainable  economic  development.  Policy  measures  to  reduce \nincome  inequality  should  include  effective  human  capital  policies,  such  as  inclusive \neducation  and \nto \ninternational  trade  and  technological  innovation  that  would  be  harmful  to  sustaining \neconomic  growth.  In  addition,  social  benefits  and  redistributive  policies  should  be \nenhanced to protect the weak and ameliorate income distribution. \n\nfor  unskilled  workers,  rather  than  building  barriers \n\ntraining \n\nAn  important  question  is  how  education  affects  the  degree  of  intergenerational  \nmobility.  Studies  show  that  greater  income  inequality  at  a  given  point  in  time  is \nassociated  with  less  intergenerational  mobility,  which  is  known  as  the  \u201cGreat  Gatsby \nCurve.\u201d  One  important  link  between  income  equality  and  intergenerational  mobility \nmust  be  the  distribution  of  schooling  (in  terms  of  quantity  and  quality)  among  the \npopulation.  More  unequal  income  distribution  among  families  causes  opportunities  \nfor  economic  advancement  to  be  distributed  more  unequally  among  children.  The \ndistribution of educational attainment and income among the population is likely to be \ntransmitted from one generation to the next. Our subsequent research will focus on this \nimportant issue.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n22 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 810 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nLee and Lee \n\nAcemoglu, D., S. Naidu, P. Restrepo, and J.

The  regressions,  using  a panel  data set  covering  a  broad \nrange of countries between 1980 and 2015, show that a more equal distribution of education \ncontributes  significantly  to  reducing  income  inequality.  Educational  expansion  is  a  major \nfactor  in  reducing  educational  inequality  and  thus  income  inequality.  Public  policies  that \nimprove  social  benefits  and  price  stability  contribute  to  reducing  income  inequality,  while \npublic spending on education helps to reduce educational inequality. In contrast, higher per \ncapita  income,  greater  openness  to  international  trade,  and  faster  technological  progress \ntend to make both income and education distribution more unequal. Using the calibration of \nempirical results, we find that we can attribute the rising income inequality within East Asian \neconomies  in  recent  decades  to  the  unequalizing  effects  of  fast  income  growth  and  rapid \nprogress  in  globalization  and  technological  change,  which  have  surpassed  the  income-\nequalizing effects from improved equality in the distribution of educational attainment during \nthe period. \n \nKeywords: income distribution, inequality, human capital, education, globalization, \ntechnological change  \n \nJEL Classification: D31, H52, I24, O53 \n \n", " \n"]}
