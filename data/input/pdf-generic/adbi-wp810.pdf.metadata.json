INTRODUCTION \nIn recent decades, rising income inequality has attracted attention. In many countries, \nalongside income growth, income inequality has increased (Piketty 2014). Many East \nAsian economies that have achieved the \u201cmiracle\u201d of \u201cgrowth with equity\u201d have also \nwitnessed the deterioration of income distribution (Zhuang, Kanbur, and Rhee 2014; \nJain-Chandra et al. 2016). \nHigh  income  inequality,  especially  that  originating  from  prevalent  inequality  of \nopportunities  in  a  society,  is  undesirable  from  the  perspective  of  social  justice. \nFurthermore,  unfair  income  distribution  can  be  harmful  to  sustainable  economic  \ngrowth.  Higher  inequality  provides  fewer  education  opportunities  for  talented  yet \nunderprivileged  individuals  and  discourages  investment  by  making  a  society  more \nunstable. Hence, all states endeavor to ensure basic livelihoods for the poor and \ndisadvantaged by building social security systems and to reduce inequalities in wealth \nand income by adopting redistribution policies.  \nResearch often emphasizes human capital as one of the major factors affecting the \ndegree of income inequality. Human capital, measured by the educational attainment \nembodied in a worker, is a major determinant of the worker\u2019s lifetime earnings. Parents \nconsider educational investment in their children as an important way to improve their \nchildren\u2019s future earnings. Many governments use higher spending on education as an \neffective tool for reducing educational inequality and thus income inequality. Despite \nthis  general  perception  of  and  interest  in  the  importance  of  education  for  income \ndistribution among the public and policy makers, the relationship between educational \nattainment and its distribution in populations experiencing income equality is not always \nclear in theoretical and empirical studies.1  \nRecently, educational attainment has been expanding and educational inequality has \nbeen narrowing in many countries and regions, but at the same time income inequality \nhas been widening, as shown in section 3. As researchers predict increases in the \naverage educational attainment and educational equality to lower income inequality, \nthis trend is puzzling. We must determine the exact contribution of education to income \ndistribution by assessing the roles of all the important factors in income distribution. For \nexample, during this recent period, rapid globalization and technological progress have \noccurred  worldwide.  While  many  studies  have  investigated  the  causes  of  income \ninequality, none have yet thoroughly analyzed the exact contribution of education to \nincome inequality, especially in intertemporal, cross-national contexts.  \nAgainst this backdrop, this paper empirically analyzes the important factors for income \ninequality across countries over the past four decades and determines how the level \nand distribution of educational attainment are related to income distribution. We also \nassess the way in which international trade, technological progress, and public policies \nsuch as social benefits and expenditures on education are related to income and \neducation distribution.  \nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the \nliterature  on  education  and  income  inequality.  Section  3  discusses  the  data  and \npresents stylized facts on the evolution of education and income inequality. In Section \n4, we analyze the determinants of income inequality using a panel data set covering a \nbroad range of countries for the period between 1980 and 2015. Using the regression \nresults, we discuss the role of educational attainment and its distribution in terms of \n                                                 \n1  See the literature survey in section 2. \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 810  Lee and Lee \n \nincome inequality. As an illustration, we also apply the results to East Asian economies \nand  establish  the  extent  to  which  education  and  other  major  determinants  have \ncontributed to the change in income inequality in recent decades. Section 5 analyzes \nthe determinants of educational inequality and discusses how educational expansion \ncan affect educational inequality and thus income inequality. Section 6 concludes.  \n2.  LITERATURE REVIEW ON EDUCATION  \nAND INCOME INEQUALITY \nThe human capital model suggests that the level and distribution of schooling across \nthe population determines the distribution of earnings (Becker and Chiswick 1966; \nMincer 1974). Hence, the model predicts that the supply and demand of educated \npeople influence the earnings inequality in a society. While the model predicts an \nunambiguously positive association between educational inequality, as measured by \nthe variance of schooling, and income inequality, the effect of the average years of \nschooling on income inequality may be either positive or negative, depending on the \nevolution of the rates of return on education. \nConsider the following human capital earnings function (De Gregorio and Lee 2002):  \n  (1) \n\ud835\udc46\nwhere Y\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5cs\ud835\udc54 is\ud835\udc4c \ud835\udc46th=e \ud835\udc59l\ud835\udc5ce\ud835\udc54ve\ud835\udc4cl\ud835\udc5c o+f e\u2211a\ud835\udc57r=n0inloggs\ufffd 1w+ith\ud835\udc5f S\ud835\udc57\ufffd l+ev\ud835\udc62el of schooling, r is the rate of return on the \nj\njth year or level of schooling, and u represents other non-school-related factors that \naffect earnings. The following can approximate this function:  \n  (2) \n\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc60 = \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc5c +\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc46+\ud835\udc62\nTaking the variance yields the following earnings distribution function: \n  (3) \n2 2\nThis  im\ud835\udc49p\ud835\udc4el\ud835\udc5fie(s\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c \ud835\udc54t\ud835\udc4ch\ud835\udc46a)t =in\ud835\udc5f\u0305c\ud835\udc49om\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5fe( \ud835\udc46)in+eq\ud835\udc46u\u0305 a\ud835\udc49l\ud835\udc4eit\ud835\udc5fy( \ud835\udc5fi)n+cre2a\ud835\udc5f\u0305\ud835\udc46se\u0305\ud835\udc36s\ud835\udc5c \ud835\udc63(u\ud835\udc5fn,a\ud835\udc46)m+bi\ud835\udc49gu\ud835\udc4eo\ud835\udc5fu(\ud835\udc62s)ly  with  educational \ninequality, Var(S), if controlling for other things. However, if the return on education, r, \ndecreases with educational inequality, the relationship can be ambiguous. In most \ncases, however, educational inequality and the wage premium for higher education \nwould move in the same direction, as an increase in the supply of higher-educated \npeople  tends  to  lower  both  the  educational  inequality  and  the  wage  premium. \nMeanwhile, educational expansion, that is, an increase in S, leads to a more unequal \nincome distribution when r and S are independent. However, if the covariance between \nthe return on education and the level of education is negative, the relationship between \neducational expansion and income inequality can reduce income inequality. Since the \ncovariance  term  is  expected  to  be  negative,  the  relationship  between  educational \nexpansion and income inequality should be ambiguous.  \nWe  would  expect  educational  expansion,  S,  either  to  improve  or  to  deteriorate \neducational  distribution,  Var(S),  depending  on  its  initial  level  and  distribution  \n(De  Gregorio  and  Lee  2002).  In  a  society  in  which  only  a  small  fraction  of  the \npopulation has received formal education, the average educational attainment is low \nand the educational inequality is high. With an expansion of educational attainment, the \nlevel of educational inequality would increase if the more educated people received  \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 810  Lee and Lee \n \na higher level of education, but it would decrease if the uneducated people received \nsome education.  \nKnight and Sabot (1983) suggest that educational expansion has an ambiguous effect \non income distribution. They show that educational expansion has two offsetting effects \non income distribution: the \u201ccomposition effect,\u201d whereby wage inequality rises initially, \nwhen  the  educational  expansion  leads  to  an  increase  in  the  proportion  of  more \neducated workers; and the \u201cwage compression effect,\u201d implying that, when the supply \nof educated labor exceeds the demand as a result of educational expansion, the \npremium for educated workers will eventually diminish and thereby wage inequality will \ndecline.  \nThe  empirical  literature  studying  the  relationship  between  education  and  income \ninequality using cross-country data often presents contradictory results. It commonly \nuses two measures of educational inequality: the standard deviation of schooling (Ram \n1990; Lam and Levinson 1991; De Gregorio and Lee 2002) and the education Gini \ncoefficient (Checchi 2001; Thomas, Wang, and Fan 2002). \nSeveral studies, including those by Park (1997) and De Gregorio and Lee (2002), find \nthat greater educational dispersion has an unequalizing effect on income distribution \nwhile higher educational attainment has an equalizing effect on income distribution. \nJaumotte, Lall, and Papageorgiou (2013) show that income inequality decreases with \nthe average years of schooling. However, holding the average education constant, \nincome inequality tends to increase as the share of the population with secondary or \ntertiary education increases.  \nConversely, Ram (1984) finds no adverse effect of educational inequality on income \ndistribution, while higher educational attainment appears to have a mild equalizing \neffect.  F\u00f6ldv\u00e1ri  and  van  Leeuwen  (2011)  also  identify  an  insignificant  effect  of \nschooling inequality on income inequality. Checchi (2001) confirms that educational \nachievement has a strong negative impact on income inequality. Furthermore, a U-\nshaped relationship between educational inequality and income inequality is apparent \nwhen controlling for educational attainment.  \nCross-country studies also show a negative and nonlinear relationship between years \nof  schooling  and  educational  inequality  (Ram  1990;  De  Gregorio  and  Lee  2002; \nThomas, Wang, and Fan 2002), indicating that educational inequality increases as the \naverage level of schooling increases but starts to decline after reaching a peak. \nLim and Tang (2008) suggest that it is possible to measure human capital inequality \nusing the distribution of the Mincerian-type measure of human capital rather than the \naverage years of schooling. They show that the measure of human capital inequality \nhas an inverted U-shaped relation with the average years of schooling as well as \neducational inequality. Castell\u00f3-Climent and Dom\u00e9nech (2017) find that the distribution \nof Mincerian-type human capital has a positive relation with income distribution.  \nThe findings of the existing studies using micro-level data are also broadly consistent \nwith those of cross-country studies. Overall, educational inequality has an unequalizing \neffect on income distribution, while educational expansion has an ambiguous effect on \nincome distribution.  \nKatz  and  Murphy  (1992)  show  that  changes  in  the  relative  earnings  of  college \ngraduates, which were related to fluctuations in the supply of college graduates and a \nstrong demand for skilled workers, could explain the changes in the wage structure in \nthe United States in the period from 1963 to 1987. Goldin and Katz (2009) show that a \nslowdown in education caused much of the increase in US wage inequality in the \nrecent period. The premium for higher education and skills has also risen across many \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 810  Lee and Lee \n \ndeveloped countries in recent decades, contributing substantially to the rise in earnings \ninequality (Autor 2014). \nA substantial body of literature also analyzes the change in the labor demand and \nsupply and wage inequality in developing countries using micro-level data. Since the \nmid-1990s, the average returns on an additional year of schooling have increased \nsignificantly in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) (Fleisher and Wang 2004; Zhang \net al. 2005; Fang et al. 2012). In urban India, wage inequality has increased since  \nthe start of the economic reform in 1991, mainly owing to increases in the returns on \nskills  (Kijima  2006).  Lee  and  Wie  (2017)  show  that  the  rapid  development  in  the  \nPRC and India was associated with an increase in the relative wage of workers with \nhigher education. \nCase  studies  on  income  distribution  dynamics  in  three  East  Asian  countries\u2014\nIndonesia,  Malaysia,  and  the  PRC\u2014and  four  in  Latin  America\u2014Argentina,  Brazil, \nColombia, and Mexico\u2014observe that, while the mean years of schooling rose and the \nschooling level became more equal among the working-age population during the \nperiod studied, income inequality also rose in most economies, except in Brazil, where \nthe distribution improved slightly (Bourguignon, Ferreira, and Lustig 2004). They find \nthat changes in the distribution of education also had an overall unequalizing effect  \non household income, except in Brazil and Taipei,China. For example, the greater \nimprovement in education among high-income groups had the greatest unequalizing \neffect on household income in Indonesia. Conversely, in the case of Taipei,China, \neducation  increased  substantially  such  that  the  average  schooling  among  poor \nhouseholds also improved, and, as a result, inequality in education fell. Meanwhile, the \nrising trend of inequality in Latin American countries reversed from the mid-1990s. \nLustig, Lopez-Calva, and Ortiz-Juarez (2013) explain that the decline in labor income \ninequality was associated with higher education and, consequently, with more equal \neducational distribution.  \nUsing a microeconometric decomposition method and comparing the distributions of \nhousehold  incomes  between  the  United  States  and  Brazil  in  1999,  Bourguignon, \nFerreira, and Leite (2008) find that educational distribution is important in explaining the \ndifferences in household income distribution between the two countries.  \n3.  EVOLUTION OF EDUCATION  \nAND INCOME INEQUALITY  \nChallenges  of  data  comparability  confront  the  analysis  of  income  inequality  for \nintertemporal, cross-country comparison. We rely on the Gini index of net income (that \nis,  post-tax,  post-transfer)  taken  from  the  Standardized  World  Income  Inequality \nDatabase (SWIID) that Frederik Solt (2016) compiled. This data set provides measures \nof income inequality with reasonable comparability for the broad range of countries in \nthe  world  since  1960.  Since  the  database  provides  more  observations  from  1980 \nonwards, our analysis focuses on the period from 1980 to 2015.  \nWe compile the net income equality of countries and economies since 1980. We use \nfive-year averages, such as 1980\u201384, 1985\u201389, \u2026, and 2010\u201314 to reduce the short-\nterm variations as well as the possible measurement errors. Figure 1 presents the \ntrend of income equality by major regions, using the unweighted averages for the panel \nof 60 countries that have complete observations at five-year intervals. The regions \nconsist of \u201cadvanced countries\u201d and six \u201cdeveloping regions\u201d: East Asia/Pacific, Eastern \nEurope/Central Asia, Latin America/Caribbean, Middle East/North Africa, South Asia, \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 810  Lee and Lee \n \nand Sub-Saharan Africa.2 The figure shows that the advanced countries and Eastern \nEuropean countries, on average, have maintained considerably more equal distribution \nof income than countries from other developing regions throughout the period have. \nThe levels of income inequality in Latin America and Sub-Saharan African countries \nhave been higher than those in other regions but have followed declining trends in \nrecent decades. In contrast, income inequality in the East Asian countries has been \nrelatively low but has risen in recent decades.  \nFigure 1: Trends of the Net Income Gini Coefficient from 1980\u201384 to 2010\u201314  \nfor a Balanced Panel of 60 Economies \n \nFigure 2 presents data for 16 individual economies in the East and South Asian regions. \nWe observe that most Asian economies have experienced increasing income inequality \nin recent decades. The Gini coefficient of net income has worsened in 12 East and \nSouth Asian economies. From the late 1980s to the mid-2010s, it increased from 0.34 \nto 0.51 in the PRC, from 0.38 to 0.45 in Indonesia, and from 0.28 to 0.31 in the \nRepublic of Korea. During the same period, it also rose from 0.43 to 0.48 in India and \nfrom 0.34 to 0.40 in Bangladesh. In contrast, four Asian economies, including Malaysia \nand the Philippines, have reduced their income inequality in recent decades. Figure 3 \npresents the changes in income inequality measured by the Gini coefficient of net \nincome in the selected economies in other regions.  \nFor the measure of human capital, we use the average years of schooling for the \nworking-age population that Barro and Lee (2013, 2015) constructed. The most recent \nBarro\u2012Lee data set provides estimates of educational attainment for the populations  \nof 146 countries, disaggregated by gender and five-year age group, from 1950 to 2015 \nat  five-year  intervals.  The  data  set  distinguishes  between  seven  different  levels  \nof  education:  no  formal  education,  incomplete  primary,  complete  primary,  lower \nsecondary, upper secondary, incomplete tertiary, and complete tertiary. We use these \ndata to calculate the average years of schooling among the adult population both as a \nwhole and at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. \n \n                                                 \n2  See Appendix Table 1 for a list of the countries included in each region/group. \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 810  Lee and Lee \n \nFigure 2: Trends of Income Inequality in East and South Asian Economies  \n \n   \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 810  Lee and Lee \n \nFigure 3: Trends of Income Inequality in Selected Economies  \nof Other Groups/Regions \n \n   \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 810  Lee and Lee \n \nWe construct the average number of years of schooling for the population aged 15\u201364, \nS, as:  \n  (4) \n\ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc4e\n\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61 = \u2211\ud835\udc4e=1\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc46  = \u2211\ud835\udc4e=1\ud835\udc59 (\u2211\ud835\udc57\u210e\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc57)\nwhere   is the population share of five-year age group   in the working-age population \nand   i\ud835\udc4es the number of years of schooling of age group  .

EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF INCOME INEQUALITY  \nThis section explores the major factors that can explain income inequality for a broad \nnumber  of  countries  over  three  decades.

The main results reported here are robust when the sample is \nrestricted to the balanced panel of 59 countries that have complete data. \n12 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 810  Lee and Lee \n \nThe basic specification controls for the log of per capita GDP and its square to capture \nthe Kuznets inverted-U curve for the relationship between the income distribution and \nthe level of income (Kuznets 1955). We want to assess the effect of education factors, \nindependently from per capita income, on income inequality. For the environmental and \npolicy  variables,  we  consider  trade  openness,  inflation,  fiscal  policy  (government \nconsumption and social benefits), a democracy indicator, and technological progress.  \nWe measure trade openness using the ratio of exports plus imports to the GDP. \nTheoretically  and  empirically,  we  consider  international  trade  to  influence  income \ninequality. According to a Heckscher\u2012Ohlin trade model, when it opens up to trade,  \na country with abundant low-skilled labor will experience an increase in the relative \nwage of unskilled workers, thus reducing wage inequality. However, if trade transmits \nskill-biased technological change to developing countries, increased trade openness \ncould cause higher wage inequality by shifting the labor demand towards more skilled \nworkers. The evidence suggests that trade liberalization has a significant effect on \nwage inequality through its impact on the adoption of new skill-intensive technologies \n(Berman, Bound, and Machin 1998; Bourguignon, Ferreira, and Lustig 2004; Lee and \nWie 2015).4  \nWe expect inflation (measured using changes in the consumer price index over five-\nyear intervals) to worsen income distribution. Inflation tends to decrease the real wage \nand  redistribute  income  from  wage  earners  to  profit  takers,  which  can  deteriorate \nincome distribution. Easterly and Fisher (2001) find that high inflation tends to reduce \nthe  share  of  the  bottom  quintile  and  the  real  minimum  wage,  increasing  income \ninequality. As inflation is a tax on cash balances, it can disproportionately hurt poor \nhouseholds, whose wealth is mostly held in liquid assets such as currency, thereby \nincreasing inequality (Albanesi 2007). \nWe also add democracy as a determinant of income inequality. For nondemocratic \nregimes,  in  which  political  power  is  concentrated  within  a  narrow  segment  of  the \nsociety, we expect income inequality to be higher. Democratic institutions, by shifting \nthe median voter towards poorer people, can increase redistributive activities, reducing \nincome inequality. On the other hand, democracy can cater to the preferences of the \nricher population or the middle class, thus exacerbating inequality (Acemoglu et al. \n2015).  The  empirical evidence  does  not  support  a  strong  effect of  democracy  on \nincome inequality. However, it appears to support the idea that democracy influences \nincome  inequality  through  the  indirect  channels  of  the  tax  rate  and  education \n(Acemoglu et al. 2015). As the measure of democracy, we use the Freedom House \nPolitical Rights Index (converted from seven categories into a scale from zero to one, \nwith higher values representing the increasing presence of political rights). \nFiscal  policy  is  an  important  factor  that  influences  income  distribution.  We  expect \nredistributive  policies  to  reduce  income  inequality  (Benabou  2000;  De  Gregorio  \nand Lee 2002). The effect of overall government expenditures on income distribution \nmust depend on composition, coverage, and targeting. We consider the extent of \ngovernment consumption, defined as the ratio of government consumption to the GDP, \nas a fiscal policy variable. We also use social benefit expenditure, which includes direct \ntransfers to the poor for unemployment compensation, social security pensions, and \n                                                 \n4  We also consider financial openness as a potential driver of income inequality, but it turns out to be \nstatistically insignificant. \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 810  Lee and Lee \n \nthe provision of medical services, as another fiscal policy variable redistributing income \nfrom rich to poor.5  \nThe  principal  link  between  technology  and  income  inequality  is  the  channel  of  \nskill-biased technical change. Technological change, which causes a relative demand \nshift favoring those with a high level of education, increases the relative wage of more-\neducated workers relative to under-educated workers. A difficulty arises regarding the \naccurate measurement of technological change. In this study, we adopt two measures, \nconsidering data availability: the number of patents and the share of high-technology \nexports in the total manufactured exports. The number of patents is the total number  \nof  applications  filed  by  \u201capplicant\u2019s  origin\u201d  under  the  World  Intellectual  Property \nOrganization  (WIPO)\u2019s  Patent  Cooperation  Treaty  (WIPO  2016).  High-technology \nexports are products with high research and development (R&D) intensity, such as \nthose in aerospace, computers, electrical machinery, pharmaceuticals, and scientific \ninstruments (World Bank 2017).  \nFigures 12 and 13 present the trends of trade openness and technological progress, \nrespectively, for each region from 1980 to 2015 for the sample of countries that have \ncomplete information. The numbers are unweighted averages for the countries in each \nregion. Trade openness shows significant variation across regions. It has been high \nand risen fast on average in advanced economies and East Asian economies. The \nmeasures of technological progress also show significant regional variations but have \nbeen high in advanced economies and East Asian economies. \nFigure 12: Trends of Trade Openness by Region  \nfor a Balanced Sample of 123 Economies \n \n   \n                                                 \n5  We also consider public education appending as another fiscal variable that can influence income \ndistribution, but it turns out to be statistically insignificant. However, spending on education has a \nsignificantly positive effect on educational equality, as shown in Section 5. \n14 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 810  Lee and Lee \n \nFigure 13: Trends of Technology by Region, Unbalanced Sample \n \nWe estimate this system of seven equations in (6) with country fixed effects. The  \nfixed-effects estimation controls for possible bias when unobserved and persistent \ncountry  characteristics  that  influence  the  income  Gini  variable  correlate  with  the \nexplanatory variables. To reduce the reverse causality, we use per capita income and \neducational variables at the beginning of the period. For other policy variables, we use \nthe values for the contemporaneous period corresponding to the income distribution \nvariable. However, considering that the reverse causality from income distribution to \nour environmental and policy measures may cause biased estimates, we also adopt \ninstrumental  variable  (IV)  estimation  techniques.  The  IV  estimation  uses  lagged  \nvalues of policy variables as instruments. Note that it is practically difficult to adopt \ninstrumental variable estimation techniques by constructing a set of fully convincing \nexogenous instruments in this panel structure.  \n15 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 810  Lee and Lee \n \nRegression (1) of Table 1 presents the estimation results of the basic specification (6) \nusing income, education, and four policy variables (namely trade openness, inflation, \ndemocracy,  and  government  consumption)  with  country  fixed  effects.  The  sample \nincludes 608 observations for seven periods for 95 countries.  \nThe estimates of per capita GDP support the nonlinear effects of per capita income that \nthe Kuznets curve proposes. The coefficients of per capita GDP and its square terms \nare  positive  and  negative,  respectively.  The  estimates  are  individually  and  jointly \nstatistically  significant,  but  the  square  term  is  only  marginally  significant.  This \nconfiguration of coefficients indicates an initial increase and a subsequent decline in \nthe  income  Gini  coefficient  with  log  per  capita  income  when  controlling  for  other \nvariables.  However,  the  estimated  coefficients\u2014the  linear  term  of  0.0672  and  the \nsquared term of -0.0027\u2014imply that the breakpoint is well above the range of per \ncapita income in the sample. Hence, an increase in income tends to worsen income \ninequality. According to the estimated coefficients, an increase of 1 standard deviation \n(1.16) at the mean (9.03 or $8,350) in the log per capita income leads to an increase in \nthe  income  Gini  coefficient  of  about  0.018  (that  is,  1.8  percentage  points),  which \naccounts for about 20% of the standard deviation of the Gini coefficient. \nEducational  inequality,  measured  by  the  Gini  coefficient  of  educational  attainment \namong  the  population,  has  a  significantly  positive  effect  on  income  inequality.  In \nregression  (4),  the  estimated  coefficient  (-0.089)  suggests  that  an increase  in  the \neducation Gini coefficient of 1 standard deviation (0.18) increases the income Gini \ncoefficient by about 0.016 (that is, 1.6 percentage points), which accounts for about  \n18% of the standard deviation of the Gini coefficient. \nIn contrast, educational attainment has a statistically insignificant effect on income \ninequality  when  controlling  for  other  variables,  including  per  capita  income  and \neducational inequality. Note that, as long as educational inequality is related to the \nlevel of educational attainment, the average level of educational attainment can have \nan indirect effect on income inequality by changing educational inequality. We discuss \nthis issue in the next section.  \nWe find that trade openness has a significantly positive impact on income inequality. \nThe  estimated  coefficient  (0.017)  suggests  that  an  increase  in  the  international  \ntrade-to-GDP ratio of 0.56 (1 standard deviation) increases the Gini coefficient by about  \n1 percentage point. \nThe  positive  estimate  of  the  coefficient  of  inflation  also  supports  the  theoretical \nprediction. The estimated coefficient (0.019) implies that an increase in inflation of 1 \nstandard  deviation  (1.42)  increases  the  income  Gini  coefficient  by  about  0.3 \npercentage  points.  Conversely,  democracy  and  government  consumption  are  not \nstatistically significant when controlling for per capita income, educational inequality, \naverage educational attainment, and other policy variables. \n   \n16 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 810  Lee and Lee \n \nTable 1: Regression Results for Income Inequality \n  (1)  (2)  (3)  (4)  (5)  (6)  (7)  (8) \nPanel FE  Panel FE  Panel FE  Panel FE \nEstimation Technique  Panel FE  Panel FE  Panel FE  Panel FE  IV  IV  IV  IV \nLog (per capita GDP)  0.0672**  0.0782***  0.0509  \u20130.0283  0.0424  0.0489*  0.0393  \u20130.0989** \n(0.0281)  (0.0280)  (0.0311)  (0.0395)  (0.0278)  (0.0290)  (0.0375)  (0.0490) \nLog (per capita GDP)  \u20130.0027*  \u20130.0035**  \u20130.0023  0.0008  \u20130.0014  \u20130.0021  \u20130.0018  0.0049* \nsquared  (0.0016)  (0.0016)  (0.0017)  (0.0022)  (0.0015)  (0.0016)  (0.00197)  (0.0027) \nEducational inequality  0.0893**  0.0888**  0.103**  0.0658  0.101**  0.111**  0.148**  0.0699 \n(0.0441)  (0.0437)  (0.0490)  (0.0546)  (0.0440)  (0.0449)  (0.0576)  (0.0534) \nEducational attainment  0.0002  0.0007  0.0023  \u20130.0035  0.0008  0.0024  0.00704*  \u20130.0032 \n(0.0031)  (0.0031)  (0.0033)  (0.0033)  (0.0032)  (0.0032)  (0.0037)  (0.0031) \nTrade openness/GDP  0.0168***  0.0172***  0.0127**  0.0050  0.0142**  0.0152***  0.0118*  0.0039 \n(0.0057)  (0.0056)  (0.0062)  (0.0057)  (0.0057)  (0.0057)  (0.0066)  (0.0058) \nInflation  0.0019**  0.0017**  0.0024***  0.0011*  0.0021***  0.0020***  0.0028**  0.0015** \n(0.0008)  (0.0008)  (0.0007)  (0.0006)  (0.0007)  (0.0007)  (0.0012)  (0.0006) \nDemocracy indicator  0.0042  0.0041  0.0118*  0.0191***  \u20130.0004  \u20130.0004  0.0146  0.0194*** \n(0.0060)  (0.0060)  (0.0069)  (0.0063)  (0.0064)  (0.0065)  (0.0096)  (0.0071) \nGovernment  \u20130.0206  \u20130.0242  0.0265  \u20130.0256  \u20130.0300  \u20130.0353  0.0436  0.0547 \nconsumption/GDP  (0.0231)  (0.0229)  (0.0319)  (0.0327)  (0.0234)  (0.0237)  (0.0394)  (0.0384) \nPatents     0.182***        0.163***     \n  (0.0384)        (0.0383)     \nHigh-technology exports/      0.0379*        0.0091   \nmanufacturing exports      (0.0214)        (0.0251)   \nSocial spending/GDP        \u20130.0862*        \u20130.101* \n      (0.0504)        (0.0553) \nN, N of country  608, 95  595, 93  460, 91  333, 71  578, 95  553, 93  369, 90  265, 67 \nR2  0.131  0.167  0.156  0.305  0.103  0.148  0.128  0.338 \nNotes: Panel FE indicates panel regression with country fixed effects and Panel FE IV uses values over the previous \nfive years or in the initial year of each period of the explanatory variables as instrumental variables (IVs).

The estimation result shows that, when controlling for other explanatory \nvariables,  income  inequality  is  strongly  positively  associated  with  technological \ndevelopment. The estimated coefficient (0.146) suggests that an increase in the log \nvalue of patents of 0.05 (1 standard deviation) increases the Gini coefficient by about \n0.9 percentage points. In regression (3), income inequality is also positively, though \nonly marginally statistically significantly, related to high-technology exports, which is \nanother  measure  of  technological  development.  The  estimated  coefficient  of  high-\ntechnology exports (0.038) suggests that an increase of 0.12 in the ratio of high-\ntechnology exports to manufacturing exports increases the income Gini coefficient by \nabout 0.5 percentage points.  \nRegression (4) of Table 1 adds government social benefits as an explanatory variable. \nBecause the sample size shrinks substantially, the results for the other explanatory \nvariables  change  considerably.  Notably,  the  estimates  for  the  per  capita  income  \nand educational inequality variables become statistically insignificant. Nevertheless, \nsocial benefit spending has a significantly negative effect on income inequality.

Interestingly, democracy enters regressions (3) and (4) \npositively and statistically significantly with these samples, implying that a democratic \nregime tends to be associated positively with activities that worsen income inequality, \nespecially when controlling for redistributive activities.  \nRegressions (5)\u2012(8) of Table 1 present the results from the IV estimation techniques to \ncontrol for the endogeneity of the policy variables, using their lagged values as IVs. \nThe use of lagged values as instruments reduces the number of observations in the \nearly  period  in  some  specifications.  The  table  shows  that  the  major  results  in \nregressions (1)\u2013(4) change very little in IV estimation.  \nTo  assess  the  effects  of  education  and  other  explanatory  variables  on  income \ndistribution quantitatively, we decompose the evolution of income inequality in  the  \nEast Asian region. Researchers have seen many East Asian economies as examples \nof  \u201cgrowth  with  equity,\u201d  but  in  recent  decades  they  have  experienced  significant \ndeterioration of income distribution. Columns (1)\u2013(3) of Table 2 show the actual values \nof  the  income  Gini  coefficient  and  all  the  explanatory  variables  for  1985\u201389  and  \n2010\u201314  and  the  differences  between  the  two  periods  for  the  average  of  eight \neconomies that have complete data: the PRC; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Malaysia; \nthe Philippines; the Republic of Korea; Singapore; and Thailand. Columns (1)\u2013(3) show \nthe actual values of the income Gini coefficient and all the explanatory variables. The \nactual average values were 0.396 and 0.429 for 1985\u201389 and 2010\u201314, respectively, \nand  increased  by  3.3  percentage  points  over  25  years  in  East  Asia.  Using  the \nregression result in column (2) of Table 1, we construct the values of the income Gini \ncoefficient that each explanatory variable predicts for each period and the difference \nbetween  the  two  periods.  The  model-based  predicted  values  of  the  income  Gini \ncoefficient in 1985\u201389 and 2010\u201314 were about 2 percentage points lower than the \nactual values and increased by 2.8 percentage points between the two periods.  \nColumn (4) of Table 2 shows the extent to which the change in each explanatory \nvariable  contributes  to  the  predicted  change  in  the  income  Gini  coefficient  of  2.8 \npercentage points over the period in the region. We find that the per capita income \nincrease played an important role, contributing 1.6 percentage points. Trade openness \nand technological progress also made significant contributions of about 1.0 and 1.5 \npercentage points, respectively. More equal distribution of education counterbalanced \nthese unequalizing effects by reducing the income Gini coefficient by as much as  \n1.5  percentage  points.  However,  an  increase  in  educational  attainment  had  a \ndeteriorating effect on income distribution of about 0.3 percentage points.7  \nWe can also gauge the role of social benefits in explaining the change in income \ninequality. During this period, the share of social benefits in the GDP increased from \n0.7% to 2.9% on average in East Asian economies. Using the estimated coefficient of \nsocial benefits in column (4) of Table 1, we estimate the increase in government social \nspending to have contributed to reducing income inequality by about 0.2 percentage \npoints. Hence, the small increase in social benefits had only a minor impact on income \ndistribution in East Asia. If social spending had increased to 10% of the GDP, the world \naverage, it would have decreased the income Gini coefficient by 0.8 percentage points, \nas much as education factors.  \n                                                 \n7  Note that educational expansion can have an indirect effect on income inequality through its effect on \neducational inequality.

The  estimated  coefficient  of  the  income  level  is  statistically \nsignificant  and  positive.  Hence,  increases  in  per  capita  income  over  time  tend  to \nincrease educational inequality. The estimated coefficient (0.019) suggests that an \nincrease  in  log  per  capita  income  of  1  standard  deviation  (1.16)  increases  the \neducation Gini coefficient by 2.2 percentage points. However, income inequality is \nstatistically insignificant.  \nThe regression result shows a strong negative effect of educational attainment on \nincome  inequality.  The  estimated  coefficient  of  educational  attainment  (\u20130.035) \nsuggests that an increase in the average schooling of about 3 years (amounting to  \n1 standard deviation) decreases the education Gini coefficient by about 0.11 (that is,  \n11 percentage points), which accounts for about 60% of the standard deviation of the \neducation Gini coefficient. Therefore, the increase in educational attainment is the \nmajor driver improving the education Gini coefficient. According to the result in Table 1, \na decrease in the education Gini coefficient of 0.11 reduces the income Gini coefficient \nby about 1 percentage point. Hence, an increase in the level of educational attainment \ncan  contribute  significantly  to  reducing  income  inequality  through  the  channel  of \nchange in educational inequality. \nIn  Regression  (1),  the  coefficient  of  trade  openness  is  significantly  positive.  The \nestimated coefficient (0.031) suggests that an increase in international trade of 0.56  \n(1 standard deviation) increases the education Gini coefficient by about 1.7 percentage \npoints. Government consumption is also significantly positive. The estimated coefficient \n(0.166) suggests that an increase in government consumption of 0.07 (1 standard \ndeviation) increases the education Gini coefficient by about 1.2 percentage points. \nConversely, inflation and democracy are not statistically significant. The positive effects \nof trade openness and government consumption on educational inequality, controlling \nfor income and educational attainment variables, seem to suggest that the distribution \nof education among the population tends to become more uneven, for instance by \ndisproportionally increasing the schooling years of higher-educated people when an \neconomy  increases  its  openness  to  international  trade  or  the  size  of  government \nconsumption.  \nRegressions (2)\u2013(3) include technology variables. In contrast to the regressions of \nincome inequality, there is no significant effect of technological development, measured \nusing  either  the  number  of  patents  or  the  number  of  high-technology  exports,  on \neducational inequality.  \nRegression (4) adds government spending on education as an explanatory variable. \nThe  coefficient  of  spending  on  education  is  negative,  implying  that  higher  public \nexpenditure on education helps to decrease the inequality of schooling. The estimated \ncoefficient (-0.0034) suggests that an increase in government spending on education  \nof  0.016  (1  standard  deviation)  reduces  the  education  Gini  coefficient  by  about  \n0.5 percentage points. The results for the other explanatory variables in this regression \nremain quite similar to those in Regression (1). \nThe results in Tables 1 and 3 show that public policies are effective in reducing income \ninequality.  Government  social  expenditure  helps  to  reduce  income  inequality,  and \nspending on education can reduce the dispersion of education and thereby income \ninequality.  \n21 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 810  Lee and Lee \n \n6.  CONCLUDING REMARKS  \nThis paper provides evidence that human capital, measured by educational attainment, \nplays an important role in income distribution. The regressions using panel data for a \nbroad range of countries for the period between 1980 and 2015 show that more equal \ndistribution of education has contributed significantly to reducing income inequality.  \nAn increase in educational attainment reduces educational inequality and thus helps  \nto reduce income inequality. The empirical results also show that we can attribute  \nthe rising income inequality in many economies in recent decades to a fast income \nincrease,  trade  expansion,  and  rapid  technological  progress.  Reduced  educational \ninequality is an important factor that counterbalanced these income-unequalizing forces \nover the period. We also find that increased social benefit expenditures and lower \ninflation  contributed  to  making  income  distribution  more  equal.  Increased  public \nspending on education also played an important role in improving education distribution \nand thus income distribution.  \nUnderstanding the impact of education, globalization, and technological changes on \nincome distribution is important to design and implement deliberate policies towards \nmore inclusive and sustainable economic development. Policy measures to reduce \nincome inequality should include effective human capital policies, such as inclusive \neducation  and  training  for  unskilled  workers,  rather  than  building  barriers  to \ninternational trade and technological innovation that would be harmful to sustaining \neconomic  growth.  In  addition,  social  benefits  and  redistributive  policies  should  be \nenhanced to protect the weak and ameliorate income distribution. \nAn  important  question  is  how  education  affects  the  degree  of  intergenerational  \nmobility.  Studies  show  that  greater  income  inequality  at  a  given  point  in  time  is \nassociated with less intergenerational mobility, which is known as the \u201cGreat Gatsby \nCurve.\u201d One important link between income equality and intergenerational mobility \nmust be the distribution of schooling (in terms of quantity and quality) among the \npopulation.  More  unequal  income  distribution  among  families  causes  opportunities  \nfor  economic  advancement  to  be  distributed  more  unequally  among  children.  The \ndistribution of educational attainment and income among the population is likely to be \ntransmitted from one generation to the next. Our subsequent research will focus on this \nimportant issue.  \n \n   \n22 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 810  Lee and Lee \n \nREFERENCES \nAcemoglu, D., S. Naidu, P. Restrepo, and J. A.

We find that the regressions, using a panel data set covering a broad range of countries between 1980 and 2015, show that a more equal distribution of education contributes significantly to reducing income inequality. Educational expansion is a major factor in reducing educational inequality and thus income inequality. Public policies that improve social benefits and price stability contribute to reducing income inequality, while public spending on education helps to reduce educational inequality. In contrast, higher per capita income, greater openness to international trade, and faster technological progress tend to make both income and education distribution more unequal. Using the calibration of empirical results, we find that we can attribute the rising income inequality within East Asian economies in recent decades to the unequalizing effects of fast income growth and rapid progress in globalization and technological change, which have surpassed the income-equalizing effects from improved equality in the distribution of educational attainment during the period.", "Title": "Human Capital and Income Inequality"}}
