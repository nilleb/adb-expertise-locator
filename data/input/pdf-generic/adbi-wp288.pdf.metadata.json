INTRODUCTION \nFor more than twenty years prior to the global financial crisis, volatility in aggregate \neconomic activity and inflation fell dramatically in most of the industrial world. The \nwidespread  and  persistent  nature  of  this  phenomenon  was  termed  \u201cthe  great \nmoderation\u201d.  The  most  common  explanations  put  forward  for  this  include  better \nmonetary policy, structural changes in inventory management, and good luck (see \nBernanke 2004; Blanchard and Simon 2000; Summers 2005). The role played by \nmonetary policy led to a consensus that stabilization should be left to monetary policy, \nwith a focus on inflation. Fiscal policy, on the other hand, should rely on automatic \nstabilizers, with discretionary fiscal policy best avoided. \nThis consensus was cast aside in the wake of the recent global financial crisis, with \ncountries  around  the  world  adopting  unprecedented  fiscal  stimulus  packages  to \nmitigate  the  impacts  of  the  crisis. This response  hinged  on the premise  that  the \nmonetary  policy  transmission  mechanism  would  be  less  effective  in  the  current \nclimate, with considerable deleveraging taking place. In addition, further easing in \nsome cases would be limited as policy rates are already close to the zero bound. \nA critical question in this discourse is whether monetary policy has become ineffective. \nIn  some  Asian  countries,  an  activist  monetary  policy  has  not  been  attempted.  If \nexchange rates are pegged\u2014whether de facto or de jure\u2014then interest rates cannot \nbe lowered. In this instance, maintaining exchange rate stability precludes reducing \npolicy rates as a policy option. While declines in policy rates were widely observed, \nthese also reflect declines in the expected rates of inflation. In the case of Malaysia, \nfor example, Zeilesis Shah, and Patnaik (2010) found high exchange rate inflexibility \nand no structural break in the exchange rate regime when faced with the crisis. It is \nthus likely that monetary policy was not part of the stabilization measures adopted \nduring the crisis. \nThe  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  identify  some  of  the  issues  and  policy  implications \nassociated  with  the  fiscal  policy  response  to  global  financial  crisis  in  developing \ncountries. This is done by undertaking case studies of four developing countries in the \nAsian region, i.e., Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Singapore.  \nThe first section provides an overview of the literature on countercyclical fiscal policy in \ndeveloping countries, and a brief survey of the fiscal stimulus packages of countries in \nthe  Asian  region.  This  is  followed  by  a  discussion  of  some  of  the  econometric \nchallenges associated with gauging the appropriate size of fiscal stimulus packages. \nThe second section documents and evaluates the fiscal policy responses undertaken \nby Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Singapore. Each case study begins with a \nbrief historical overview of fiscal performance. This is followed by an analysis of the \nfiscal stimulus packages (in terms of both the size and composition), fiscal space, and \nfiscal  sustainability.  The  third  section  concludes  by  summarizing  the  fiscal  policy \nchallenges encountered by the countries and discussing the policy implications of the \nfindings. \n2.  COUNTERCYCLICAL FISCAL POLICY IN RESPONSE \nTO CRISIS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES  \nThere  is  considerable  debate  about  the  efficacy  of  discretionary  fiscal  policy  in \ndeveloping countries. While automatic stabilizers are weak and make the case for \ndiscretion, there is also the widely noted occurrence of \u201cprocyclicality\u201d. Kraay and \nServen (2008) state that procyclicality applies to a wide variety of measures. These \n3 ", "ADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \ninclude total expenditure, the share of total expenditure in gross domestic product \n(GDP),  public  consumption,  and  public  investment.  Recent  evidence  (Gavin  and \nPerotti  1997;  Kaminsky,  Reinhart,  and  Veigh  2004)  suggests  that  this  correlation \nreflects a mistiming of fiscal interventions. \nExplanations have also been put forward in terms of imperfections in credit markets \nthat prevent developing countries from borrowing in bad times (Kaminsky, Reinhart, \nand Veigh 2004). On the other hand, political economy explanations espouse the idea \nthat good times encourage fiscal profligacy and/or rent seeking activities (Tornell and \nLane  1999).  The  procyclicality  of  fiscal  policy  implies  that  discretionary  fiscal \ninterventions tend to increase rather than reduce output volatility. Additional volatility \ninduced by procyclical fiscal policy has been found to undermine growth in the long run \n(Fatas and Mihov 2003). \nFurther, Kraay and Severn (2008) assert that the expansionary effect of fiscal policy \ntends to be much smaller in developing countries than in developed ones. Thus, it is \nrisky to extrapolate lessons from implementing countercyclical fiscal policy in the latter \nto make policy recommendations for the former. Overall, Kraay and Severn (2008) \nconclude that evidence on the short- and long-run impact of fiscal expansions on \naggregate demand and output in developing countries is mixed. \nMoreover, there is little consensus on what a fiscal stimulus package is expected to \nachieve. As Hannoun (2009) states, there are two stylized types of policy response: \nstabilization and stimulation. A measured stabilization policy accepts the fact that \nadjustment is inescapable and therefore merely aims to mitigate the pain and promote \nan  orderly  adjustment.  Stimulation,  on  the  other  hand,  aims  to  eliminate  the \nadjustment period  altogether, and therefore involves a much larger stimulus package.  \nBlanchard et al. (2008) contend that the optimal fiscal package should be timely, large, \nlasting, diversified, contingent, collective, and sustainable. It should be timely, because \nthe need for action is immediate; large, because the current and expected decrease in \nprivate demand is exceptionally large; lasting because the downturn will last for some \ntime; diversified because of the unusual degree of uncertainty associated with any \nsingle measure; contingent, because the need to reduce the perceived probability of \nanother \u201cGreat Depression\u201d requires a commitment to do more, if needed; collective, \nsince each country that has fiscal space should contribute; and sustainable, so as not \nto lead to a debt explosion and adverse reactions of financial markets. It is likely that, \nexcept for a few countries, this wish list would be mutually exclusive.  \nThere  are  also  contradictory  views  on  ideal  the  characteristics  of  optimal  fiscal \nstimulus packages, such as their being timely, temporary, and targeted (Summers \n2008) or permanent, pervasive, and predictable (Taylor 2008). Taylor maintains that, \nbased on the permanent income theory or life cycle theory, temporary increases in \nincome will not lead to significant increases in consumption. Further, he argues that an \nacross-the-board approach is far more effective than targeting. Finally, Taylor argues \nthat government policy has been too erratic; it should be as predictable as possible so \nthat individuals and firms know what to expect. \nCountries have announced fiscal rescue packages of varying sizes, with the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) announcing the biggest total package as a percentage of \nGDP,  followed  by  Saudi  Arabia,  Malaysia,  and  the  United  States.  For  2009,  the \neconomic stimulus announced by 32 countries (including all the G20) as a percentage \nof global GDP is 1.4%, with close to 90% of the global stimulus coming from G20 \nnations (see Khatiwada 2009). \n \nKhatiwada (2009) notes that the focus of stimulus packages varies between advanced \nand  developing  economies.  Infrastructure  spending  comprises  46.5%  of  stimulus \n4 ", "ADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \npackages in developing and emerging economies, compared to 14.9% in advanced \neconomies. Meanwhile, tax cuts comprise over 34% of fiscal stimulus in advanced \neconomies, while these comprise only 3% in developing and emerging economies. \nSocial transfers to low-income citizens comprise a relatively small percentage for both \ngroups: 10.8% in advanced and 6.8% in developing and emerging countries.  \nNoticeably absent is the rationale for the composition of the fiscal stimulus packages. \nInfrastructure  spending  features  strongly  as  a  major  item  of  expenditure,  and \ncomprises more  than  60%  of  stimulus  packages  in Thailand, the  Philippines,  the \nRepublic of Korea (hereafter Korea), and PRC (Table 1). However, it is not clear why \nthis should be the major focus of fiscal stimulus, if the aim is to increase the level of \naggregate demand in a timely, temporary, and targeted manner.  \nTable 1: Features of Fiscal Stimulus Package: Three Major Items of Expenditure \n \nCountry  Infrastructure  Tax Breaks  Transfers  Other \nIndonesia  X  X    Waived import duties \nMalaysia        Guarantee funds, equity \ninvestment \nPhilippines  X  X    General increase in budget \nPRC  X      Health care reform \nRepublic of Korea  X  X  X   \nThailand    X  X  Education \nIndia  X      home loans, export \nincentives \nNote: PRC=People\u2019s Republic of China  \nSource: Author\u2019s estimates \nIn Asia, there appears to be wide variation in terms of the size of the stimulus (Table \n2). Most  Asian  countries  announced fiscal  stimulus  packages  without  providing a \ndetailed justification for the magnitude of spending. PRC has rolled out the largest \npackage, despite projections which predict a smaller decline in its GDP relative to \nother Asian countries. There is little doubt that PRC possesses the fiscal space to \nundertake this ambitious fiscal stimulus. \n5 ", "ADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \n \nTable 2: Fiscal Stimulus Packages in Selected Asian Economies \n \nCountry  Forecast  Stimulus/GD Deficit  Deficit  Debt/G Current \ndrop in  P, 2008 (%)  2008/GD 2009/GD DP,  Account \nGDP*  P  P  2008  Balance/G\n(%)  (%)  (%)  DP (%) \n2008 \nIndonesia  -3.6  1.2  -0.1  -2.1  33  0.2 \nMalaysia  -7.3  10  -4.8  -7.6  42.5  17.6 \nPhilippines  -4.6  4.1  -0.9  -2.3  56  2.5 \nPRC  -2.5  13  -0.4  -3.2  17.6  10.1 \nRepublic of Korea  -6.2  12.8  0.3  -6.5  33  -0.4 \nThailand***  -10  1.1  -1.1  -6  33.6  -0.1 \nIndia     -3.2  4.2  8.4  10  82  -3 \nNotes: GDP = gross domestic product; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China; * measures the difference in IMF\u2019s \nGDP forecasts between 2008 and the 2009; ** estimate as a result of implementing the stimulus as \nannounced by country authorities; *** new package of more than 17% of GDP over three years   \nSource(s):   Khatiwada (2009); International Financial Statistics (IMF) \nOwing to their strong export orientation, Malaysia and Korea are projected to suffer a \nlarge decline in GDP, and have thus also announced large fiscal stimulus packages. \nWith far  less fiscal  space,  the  Philippines,  which  has  drastically  reduced  its  debt \nrecently, announced a stimulus amounting to 4.1% of GDP. Indonesia is still projected \nto grow fairly strongly, and has announced a modest stimulus of 1.2% of GDP. \nThe scope for countercyclical fiscal policy is usually assessed in developed countries \nby estimating the output gap and the role of automatic stabilizers.  In the case of \ndeveloping  countries,  however,  it  is  difficult  to  measure  the  output  gap  estimate \nprecisely.  This  is  due  to  data  limitations,  structural  breaks  in  time  series,  and \nexogenous factors which have large impacts on the economy, owing to a lack of \ndiversification in the economic structure (Mueller, Yackovlev, and Weisfeld 2009). It is \ntherefore difficult to gauge which variables fiscal policy should target.  \nIn deciding on the size of fiscal packages, the ideal would be to estimate the output \ngap and multiplier effects of different types of government expenditure and perhaps \nthe lag time involved for the impacts. An estimate of fiscal sustainability should also be \nobtained. As already noted, while output gaps are routinely calculated for developed \ncountries, this is not the case for developing countries.  \nThere is an ample literature on ways to measure potential output and output gaps. \nGerlach and Yiu (2004) assert that these may be usefully thought of as either following \nan a theoretical approach, a structural approach, or a mixed approach. The theoretical \napproach is primarily a statistical exercise in which actual data on output are used to \nestimate potential output. The most frequently used approaches are the (HP) filter \nproposed  by  Hodrick  and  Prescott (1997),  the  band-pass (BP) filter proposed  by \nBaxter and King (1999), and the (BN) filter proposed by Beveridge and Nelson (1981).  \nThe structural approach has the appeal of being informed by economic theory in \nestimating potential output. Typically, data on employment and estimates of the capital \nstock are used to fit a production function. Given assumptions about \u201cnormal\u201d levels of \nemployment, productivity, and the utilization of the capital stock, measures of potential \noutput  can  be  constructed.  While  the  guidance  of  theory  is  attractive,  the  data \nrequirements are quite demanding. Furthermore, poor estimates of the output gap \ncould arise from a misspecification of the production function.  \nA third approach combines a time series model with structural economic information. \nKuttner (1994) uses an Unobserved Components model and data on actual output and \n6 ", "ADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \ninflation to estimate the output gap in the US. While this approach is attractive, a \ncritical assumption is that the relationship between the output gap and inflation is \nstable during the sample period. This assumption may be particularly debatable in \neconomies that have experienced large structural changes. \nIn  this  paper,  the  output  gap  is  estimated  using  the  HP  filter  for  generating  the \npotential GDP figures for the period 2000\u20132008, using annual real GDP figures. As \nCerra and Saxena (2000) observe, the HP is a simple smoothing procedure that has \nbecome increasingly popular because of its flexibility in tracking the characteristics of \nthe fluctuations in trend output. Trend output (denoted by \u03c4 ) is derived using the HP \nfilter and is obtained by minimizing a combination of the gap between actual output (y) \nand trend output and the rate of change in trend output for the whole sample of \nobservations (T): \nmin   \nWhere \u03bb determines the degree of smoothness of the trend. \nThe shortcomings of the HP filter have been well documented. A major drawback \ncomes from the difficulty in identifying the appropriate \u201cdetrending\u201d parameter \u03bb, which \nis generally overlooked by using arbitrary values popularized by the real business \ncycle literature. Mechanical detrending based on the HP filter can lead to spurious \ncyclicality  with  the  integrated  or  nearly  integrated  time  series  and  an  excessive \nsmoothing of structural breaks. A second important flaw is the end-sample biases. \nThese reflect the symmetric trending objective of the method across the whole sample \nand the different constraints that apply within the sample and the edges. \nIn a survey of the literature on multipliers, Spilimbergo, Symansky, and Schindler \n(2009) note that there is wide disagreement on the reliability of multipliers, due in part \nto methodological differences. There are four broad methodologies that have been \nused  to  calculate  fiscal  multipliers.  These  are  model  simulations,  Vector \nAutoregressions (VARs), econometric studies of consumer behavior in response to \nfiscal  shocks,  and  case  studies.  All  of  these  methodologies  have  limitations. \nFurthermore, they note that the range of estimates for even similar methodologies is \nlarge.  \nThis study applies a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) framework based on the \nmethodology developed by Blanchard and Perotti (2002) to estimate multipliers. It \nassumes that as discretionary fiscal decisions take time to implement (because of \npolitical and legislative requirements), the short-term (i.e., within one quarter) reaction \nof  fiscal  variables  to  current  economic  developments  only  reflect  \u201cautomatic\u201d \nresponses defined by existing laws and regulations. Fiscal developments adjusted for \nthese automatic/cyclical responses are, therefore, assumed to represent discretionary \nstructural fiscal policy shocks. The study uses logged quarterly seasonally adjusted \ndata for  the  period  2000  to  2008  and  assesses  the  impact  of  a  change  in total \ngovernment expenditure on GDP. \nLag lengths for the SVAR framework were selected by the model with the lowest \nSchwartz Information Criterion (SIC) statistic if it displayed no autocorrelation using \nthe Lagrange-multiplier (LM) test.  \nIn summary, several shortcomings have been identified with the methodology adopted \nin this paper.

CASE STUDIES \n3.1  Malaysia  \n3.1.1  A Brief Historical Overview of Fiscal Performance in Malaysia \nDuring the 1970s, the Malaysian government used revenues from newly discovered \npetroleum reserves to support high levels of public expenditure without a dramatic rise \nin debt. Much of this funding was directed at expanding state owned enterprises, \nwhich were at the forefront of Malaysia\u2019s ethnic restructuring efforts as envisaged in \nthe New Economic Policy (NEP). In fact, fiscal policy in Malaysia has been inextricably \nlinked to the NEP since its commencement in 1970. \nIn the early 1980s, commodity prices declined as a result of a recession triggered by \nthe US-led tightening of liquidity. As a result, Malaysia\u2019s terms of trade fell by 17%, \nand its current account deficit widened to 14% of GDP in 1982. Government counter-\ncyclical policy to offset the deflationary effects of the downturn resulted in soaring \npublic expenditure and a deficit of 19% of GDP (Table 3). \nTable 3: Malaysia\u2013Debt, Deficit and Current Account Ratios to GDP  \n1981\u20131988 \nYear  Total Debt/GDP   Deficit /GDP   Current Account/GDP  \n(%)  (%)  (%) \n1981    56.0  -19.1  -09.9 \n1982    70.1  -17.9  -13.5 \n1983    78.9  -13.2  -11.6 \n1984    78.1  -08.9  -04.8 \n1985    89.0  -07.4  -02.0 \n1986  112.3  -10.6  -0.40 \n1987  110.8  -07.8  8.1 \n1988  103.8  -04.3  5.2 \nGDP = gross domestic product \nSource: Bank Negara Malaysia Annual Report, various issues \nAfter the elections in 1982, when it became apparent that the recession would last \nlonger than expected, the government decided to cut back on spending. However, \nthese cuts did not affect borrowing for developing heavy industries through the Heavy \nIndustries  Corporation  of  Malaysia  (HICOM).  HICOM  pursued  a  heavy  industrial \nprogram, collaborating with foreign companies in developing a range of industries. \nThese included cement, steel, and automobile manufacturing. HICOM\u2019s activities were \nmainly financed by massive foreign borrowing from Japanese sources. \nIn 1985, Malaysia experienced its first recession as its major export earners slowed. In \n1986, the economy slumped altogether. The prices of tin, petroleum, and rubber were \nalmost half their 1984 values, and the debt-to-GDP ratio peaked soon afterwards. This \ntime  the  government  was  not  in  a  position  to  use  counter-cyclical  policy,  and \nprivatization and liberalization of foreign direct investment were undertaken instead. \nHowever,  it  was  a sustained  boom  led  by  export-oriented  manufacturing  and the \nrelocation of production from East Asia that eventually led to a decline in the debt-to-\nGDP ratio.  \nThe debt-to-GDP ratio bottomed out in years just prior to the Asian financial crisis \n(Table 4), but this decline was short-lived. In fact, Malaysia has consistently incurred \ndeficits since 1970, except for small surpluses for three years prior to the crisis when \n9 ", "ADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \nhigh growth rates were achieved.

This was announced \nunder  the  former  Prime  Minister  who  was  due  to  step  down  in  March  2009. \nApproximately 85% of this package was directed towards improving infrastructure.  \nThe construction sector welcomed the package, but other sectors were unimpressed. \nNo assistance was forthcoming for the vulnerable or those made redundant.

It comprises a fiscal injection of RM15 billion, guarantee \nfunds of RM25 billion, equity investments of RM10 billion, private finance initiatives of \nRM7 billion. and tax incentives of RM3 billion.  \nThe package is designed to achieve four separate thrusts in different areas (Table 6). \n11 ", "ADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \nTable 6: Measures Included in Malaysia\u2019s Second Fiscal Package  \nThrust  Fiscal Measures  \nThrust 1: Reduce unemployment & increase  -  Create  163,000  jobs  &  training \nopportunities (3%)  opportunities in public and private sectors  \n-  Provide  double  tax  deductions  to \nemployers hiring workers retrenched from \n1 July 2008  \nThrust 2: Assist the private sector, especially  -  Provide  RM25  billion  in  Government \nsmall and medium enterprises SMEs (48%)   Guarantee Funds, including the Working \n  Capital Guarantee Scheme (RM5 billion),  \nIndustry  Restructuring  Loan  Guarantee \nScheme  (RM5  billion),  and  credit \nenhancement  of  up  to  RM15  billion  to \ncompanies looking to raise monies via the \nbond market  \n-  Provide  RM5200  million  for  Auto \nDevelopment  Fund  to  assist  vendor \nnetwork.

The output gap as a \npercentage of GDP was in the region of plus or minus one percent of GDP prior to the \ncrisis (see Appendix 4). Currently, a negative growth rate of between 3.5 and 4.5% of \nGDP has been forecast, leaving a large output gap of at least 7% of GDP.  \nMultiplier  estimates  based  on  SVAR  show  significant  results  for  all  four  lagged \ncoefficients of the impact of government expenditure on output. This indicates that the \nlong-run multiplier, which is a summation of all the significant lagged coefficients, is \nabout 0.35. Thus, a 1% rise in government expenditure would give rise to a 0.35% \nincrease in GDP (see Appendix 4). \nWhile the announced \u201cheadline\u201d value of the stimulus is a total of RM70 billion (or 10% \nof GDP) and is expected to take the budget deficit from 4.8% of GDP to 7.6%, it is \nunlikely that this will be the final amount spent. The major thrust of the package is to \nassist the private sector, particularly small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The RM25 \nbillion  set  aside  for  guaranteed  funds  includes  RM5  billion  for  a  working  capital \nguarantee scheme for companies with equity below RM20 million; RM5 billion for an \nindustry  restructuring  guarantee  fund  for  loans  to  encourage  green  technology \napplications; and RM15 billion to facilitate access to capital markets for companies that \nintend to raise funds on the bond market.  \nFunds  to  assist  SMEs  are  certainly  warranted,  as  SMEs  make  up  99%  of  total \nregistered businesses in Malaysia. These contribute 56% to total employment, and \naccount for 32% of the GDP. In a survey of SME response to the stimulus (see New \nStraits  Times  2009),  respondents  stated  that  a  reduction  in  corporate  tax  and \nelectricity tariffs would be more effective in helping them deal with the crisis, and that \nthey could then use this surplus as working capital. The findings also indicated that \nSMEs had yet to benefit or see any impact from the various assistance programs and \nstimulus packages offered by the government; they maintained that the effect of these \nchanges would more likely be felt in the long run. \nThe  package\u2019s  second  thrust  sets  aside  RM10  billion  to  allow  Khazanah,  the \ninvestment arm of the Ministry of Finance, to increase its funds and investment. The \nexistence and operation of this fund have proven contentious. While Khazanah has \nmajor equity shares in the biggest Malaysian companies listed on the stock exchange, \nit is unclear how boosting its investments funds will provide an immediate stimulus to \nthe economy. \nThe  move  to  liberalize  the  services  sector,  involving  the  removal  of  the  30% \n\u201cbumiputera equity requirement\u201d for the 27 services sub-sectors, was announced at \nthe same time as the second stimulus package. The sub-sectors cover health and \nsocial services, as well as services in the tourism, transport, business, and computer \nand its related sectors (Appendix 3). This liberalization is to take place with immediate \neffect, and in line with the ASEAN trade liberalization arrangements. It is expected to \nattract more investments, bring in more professionals and technology, and strengthen \nthe competitiveness of the sector.  \nIn the current context, services can provide a promising avenue for generating growth \nin the future. Baily, Farrell, and Remes (2005) suggest that given the right competitive \nenvironment, services can be a powerful source of wealth creation and growth in \nmiddle income countries. \nIt is highly unlikely that Malaysia will be able to rely on its export-oriented strategy to \nthe same extent as before. Focus needs to shift to rebalancing growth and making it \nmore  domestically  driven.

Proponents maintain that doing so will have a large impact on \nproductivity and production.  \nAdditionally, there is concern that slow implementation of the stimulus package is \nimpeding its effectiveness.

Currently, Malaysia has a moderate level of \ndebt-to- GDP ratio, a comfortable reserve position, a large account surplus, and low \nlevels of short-term and foreign debt (Table 9). There appears to be the sufficient fiscal \nspace to implement a fiscal stimulus of the magnitude proposed. \nTable 9: Malaysia\u2013Selected Indicators of Fiscal Space, 2008 \nIndicator  Value \nDeficit/GDP  Increase from 4.8 % to 7.6% \nDebt/GDP  45% \nCurrent Account/GDP  17.5% \nReserves/GDP  50% \nReserves/Short-term debt  3.9 \nReserves/Months of Imports  7.7 \nFunding Sources  93% domestic \nSource: Calculated from the IMF International Financial Statistics, 2009  \nHowever, looking beyond these indicators and examining the revenue and expenditure \nside of the budget raises a number of concerns. In 2008, 44% of government revenues \nwas linked to petroleum resources transferred from the state oil company Petronas, \nwhich  is  fully  government-owned. These  include  direct taxes,  petroleum  royalties, \nexport taxes, and the item designated as interest and return on investment (Table 10). \nIn fact,  dependence  on  oil revenues  has  increased  sharply  since  2002,  when  oil \nrevenues contributed approximately 18% of the total. The projected deficit for 2009 \nwas based on high oil prices last year. \n15 ", "ADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \nTable 10: Malaysia\u2013Federal Government Revenues by Source, 2008 \n(%) \nRevenue Source  % Share \nDirect Taxes  53.7 \nCompanies  23.8 \nPetroleum  15.2 \nIndividuals  9.4 \nStamp Duties  2.2 \nOther  1.1 \nIndirect Taxes    \nExports Duties  1.8 \nImport Duties  1.7 \nExcise Duties  6.7 \nSales Tax  5.3 \nService Tax  2.1 \nOthers  1.9 \nNon-Tax Revenues  29.5  \nLicenses and Permits  3.3 \nPetroleum Royalty  3.7 \nInterest and Return on Investment  20.3 \nOthers  1.6 \nNon-Revenue Receipts  0.6 \nTOTAL  100 \nSource: Ministry of Finance, Malaysia (2009) \nThe price of Tapis crude has since fallen from US$125 per barrel to US$ 48.25 per \nbarrel in the first quarter of 2009. The budget has yet to be revised based on the more \nrecent oil price projections. In 2008, the non-oil primary balance was almost 12% of \nGDP. It is anticipated that, at the current rate of oil consumption, Malaysia could be a \nnet oil importer as early as 2011. This has implications for Malaysia\u2019s current account \nand reserves positions as well as its deficit and debt. \nIn addition, approximately half of the oil windfalls have been spent on subsidies (Table \n11), which were threatening to consume more than half of expenditures until the basis \nfor their provision was revised. Subsidies to both businesses and consumers have \nincreased consumption and depleted petroleum reserves. \nTable 11: Malaysia\u2013Federal Government Expenditure by Functional \nClassification, 2008  \n(%) \nExpenditure Item  % Share \nEmoluments  26.7 \nPensions and Gratuities  6.5 \nDebt Service  8.3 \n  Domestic   7.6 \n  Foreign  0.8 \nSupplies and Services  16.4 \nSubsidies  19.5 \nAsset Acquisition  1.8 \nGrants and Transfers  20.1 \nOther  0.6 \nTOTAL  100 \nSource: Ministry of Finance, Malaysia  \n \n16 ", "ADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \nIn terms of financing the deficit and debt, the \u201ccircular flow\u201d can be summarized as \nfollows: in 2008 Petronas funds contributes about 44% of revenues; in turn, the deficit \nis financed domestically, primarily by the Employees Provident Fund but also by other \ngovernment owned funds and banks.  \nIn the current stimulus package, Khazanah is allocated RM10 billion to  boost equity in \nstrategic sectors. These are telecommunications, technology, tourism, agriculture life \nsciences,  and  projects  related  to  Iskandar  Malaysia.1  Channeling  stimulus  funds \nthrough Khazanah has left the government open to claims that this money will be \ninjected  into  companies  which  are  already majority government-owned,  or closely \nconnected to the government. In this context, tax breaks across the board may have \nprovided a greater stimulus to the private sector and may have been regarded as more \nimpartial. \nCurrent  attention  needs  to  be  focused  on  a  deficit  reduction  strategy  given  the \nprojected  increase  in  debt-to-GDP  ratio.  At  the  end  of  2008,  the  debt  was \napproximately 45% of GDP. However, given the forecast growth rate of -3.5% for \n2009, and the current interest rate on debt of 4.2 %, debt at the end of 2009 will \nincrease sharply to approximately 54.5%. This sharp increase is a reflection of the \nlarge  differential  between  growth  rates  and  interest  rates,  as  well  as  a  negative \nprimary balance.  \nMalaysia\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio was 54.5% in 2009; assuming an annual GDP growth \nrate of 3% from 2010 to 2013, this ratio is projected to increase to 76% of GDP by \n2013. With a GDP growth rate of 5%, the ratio is projected to be slightly lower at 73% \nof GDP (Figure 1).  \nFigure 1: Malaysia\u2014Debt/GDP Projection, 2008\u20132013 \n \nGDP= gross domestic product \nSource(s):  Author\u2019s Estimations \nThe IMF projects the budget deficit for 2009 to be around 8% of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP). The non-oil deficit is projected to reach 15% of GDP in 2010. Should \nthe debt to GDP ratio reach 77% of GDP, Malaysia will need to run a primary balance \nsurplus of 4% of GDP over the next ten years to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to the \ncurrent level of 45%. Given its fiscal performance to date, this will be an enormous \nchallenge. \n \n                                                \n1Iskandar  Malaysia  is  modeled  after  the  Pearl  River  Delta  Economic  Zone.

The \nestablishment of a petroleum fund needs to be seriously considered. This will confer \nmany  benefits,  including  reduced  exposure  to  volatile  oil  prices,  procyclicality  in \nspending,  increased  transparency,  and  sensitivity  to  intergenerational  equity \nconsiderations.  \nThe high level of subsidies also needs to be reconsidered. The introduction of a value \nadded tax (VAT) has long been discussed, and its implementation in 2011 should \nproceed as scheduled. Over the medium term, consideration should be given to the \nredirection of subsidies, which consumed 20% of the budget in 2008 to provide a \nsocial safety net for the poor. Given the low official poverty rate of 6%, this may be a \nfeasible strategy. It would also help to boost the very low levels of consumption. \nThe role of Khazanah and government-linked companies should also be reviewed, \ngiven their impact on their economy. The consolidation of accounts to include all non-\nfinancial public sector enterprises and the recording of quasi-fiscal and off-budget \noperations need to improved, to provide a more accurate gauge of the assets and \nliabilities of the public sector. \n3.2  Indonesia  \n3.2.1  A Brief Historical Overview of Fiscal Performance in Indonesia \nUp  until  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  Indonesia  followed  the  balanced  budget  rule, \nwhereby routine expenditures were covered by government tax and non-tax revenue. \nThe development budget was covered partly by foreign loans, almost all of which \ncame from official development assistance. Government debt prior to the crisis was \nalmost entirely foreign, amounting to 22.9% of GDP in 1996. \nIn the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis, both foreign and domestic debt rose \nalarmingly, reaching over 100% of GDP in 2000 (Table 12). This was due to the \nmassive depreciation of the rupiah. Previously non-existent domestic debt rose from \nthe costs accruing to the budget due to the government\u2019s blanket deposit guarantee \nscheme and the issuance of recapitalization bonds to rescue the failing banking and \ncorporate sectors. This amounted to about Rp740 trillion in 1998\u20131999 (roughly one-\nhalf of GDP in 1999), one of the costliest bank bailouts in history. \n \n18 ", "ADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \nTable 12: Indonesia\u2013Government Debt Service Payment in Government Budget, \n1999\u20132002 \nYear  1997/98  1998/99  1999/00  2000  2001  2002 \nTotal Domestic  29.5  62.9  63.1  57.7  115.3  136.2 \nand Foreign \nDebt (Rp trillion) \n   External   29.5  54.5  40.9  26.5  49.0  72.9 \n   Domestic  0.0  8.4  22.2  31.2  66.3  63.4 \nTotal Debt  26.3  42.8  30.9  28.1  38.4  45.2 \nService as a \npercentage of \nrevenues \nTotal Debt  26.4  37.4  27.3  26.6  32.5  39.6 \nService as a \npercentage of \nexpenditure  \nTotal Debt  4.3  6.0  5.6  5.8  7.8  8.1 \nService as a \npercentage of \nGDP \nPrimary Fiscal  2.5  1.1  1.4  3.9  2.8  2.7 \nBalance \nFiscal  0.1  -2.0  -2.3  -1.2  -3.7  -2.5 \nSurplus/Deficit  \nDebt/GDP (%)  23  73.7  94.8  100.3  89.8  80 \n \nSource(s):  IMF, International Financial Statistics, various issues \nHill (2006) asserts that Indonesia managed to bring the fiscal deficit and debt under \ncontrol  in  spite  of  a  weakened  central  government,  an  ambitious  decentralization \nprogram, increased pressure to set up social expenditure, and widespread discontent \nwith the International Monetary Fund (IMF) stabilization program.

The output gap as a percentage of \nGDP was in the region of plus or minus two percent of GDP prior to the 2008\u201309 \nglobal financial crisis (Appendix 6). Estimates of the multiplier based on SVAR show \nsignificant results only for the third lagged coefficients. These, however, are negative. \nPrivate consumption, which accounts for about 61% of GDP (Table 13), was strong \nparticularly  in  the  first  quarter  of  2009.  Fuelled  by  high  levels  of  spending  on \nparliamentary elections and strong harvests, it recorded an increase of 6% in the first \nquarter of 2009.  \nGovernment consumption likewise recorded a 19.2% growth rate in the first quarter of \n2009.

Furthermore,  it  is \nestimated that one percent of taxpayers pay about 56% of taxes. As such, lowering the \npersonal income tax and directing more than a third of the stimulus to lifting the \nincome tax threshold only benefit a small proportion of the total population, mainly the \nrelatively better off. The estimated half of the Indonesian population living below the \npoverty line and the 40% of the population employed in the agricultural sector do not \npay taxes. The distribution is not particularly pro-poor, and direct cash transfers to \ntargeted poor households may have been more equitable. \nA similar situation is encountered as far as corporate taxes are concerned. This is \npartly due to the fact that almost 98% of the Indonesian corporate sector is dominated \nby  micro  and  small  enterprises,  which  are  legal  entities  and  are  therefore  not \nregistered for tax purposes. Ikhsan, Trialdi, and Syahrial (2005) estimate that in 2002, \nonly 200,000 corporations were registered for tax purposes, out of about 48 million \nbusinesses in Indonesia. Virtually all tax due is paid by the highest bracket. In this \ncontext  a  reduction  in  corporate  taxes  is  likely  to  benefit  the  largest  businesses \nentities. \nThe high level of informality in employment and enterprise in Indonesia impedes the \neffectiveness  of  the  fiscal  stimulus  and  the  automatic  stabilizing  impulses  of  the \nbudget. Yadav (2009) asserts that the informal sector was originally treated as a \nresidual emanating from the insufficient absorptive capacity of the formal economy, \nand that productivity growth in the formal sector acts as a \u201cpull\u201d factor, drawing in \ninformal sector workers and enterprises as development occurs. However, the informal \nsector has increased over time, particularly in the wake of the Asian financial crisis \n(OECD 2008). \n24 ", "ADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \nA more recent view (McKinsey Global Institute 2006) considers informal firms as a \nthreat to formal firms and an obstacle to growth, for two reasons. First, informal firms \ntend  to  remain  small  so  as  to  remain  under  the  radar  and  avoid  detection  by \nauthorities. This gives rise to a \u201clow-productivity trap\u201d which adversely impacts the \noverall productivity growth of a country. It has been estimated that informal firms \noperate about 50% below the average productivity level of formal firms within the \nsame sector. Second, the cost advantage enjoyed by informal firms due to tax evasion \nand regulatory non-compliance gives them an edge over formal firms, thereby allowing \nthem to impinge on the formal sector\u2019s market share. Formal firms are subjected to \nunfair  competition  which  reduces  their  incentive  to  invest,  expand,  and  improve \nproductivity. In addition, low tax revenue as a result of the large informal sector may \ninduce  more  stringent  taxation  of  the  formal  sector,  which  may  then  further  fuel \ninformality.  \nFarrell (2004) argues that informal businesses, even large ones, choose to stay that \nway if there is no change in the factors that generally drive them into informality: high \ncorporate taxes and the bureaucratic burden of operating formally. The OECD (2008) \nnotes  that,  in  Indonesia\u2019s  case,  two  important  contributors  to  informality  are  the \ntightening of employment protection legislation (EPL), especially with the enactment of \nthe Manpower Law of 2003, and sharp increases in the real value of the minimum \nwage, which is currently about 65% of the median wage. \nAccording  to  the  OECD  (2008),  the  EPL\u2019s  provisions  on  dismissal  procedures, \nseverance compensation entitlements, restrictions on flexible work arrangements, and \nminimum-wage setting have been the least conducive to improvements in labor market \noutcomes. This is affirmed in the World Bank\u2019s (2009b) Doing Business in Indonesia \nSurvey, where Indonesia ranks 150 out of a total of 183 countries in terms of difficulty \nassociated with hiring labor. Indonesia also ranks poorly in terms of opening and \nclosing a business and enforcing contracts. These concerns need to be addressed if \nlabor market informality is to be reduced. \nWith regard to subsidies, these currently consume more than 10% of government \nexpenditure in 2008 (Table 19), with the bulk directed to fuel. Most of these subsidies \nare  poorly  targeted,  with fuel  subsidies  benefiting  the  richest  20%  of  households \n(Augustina et al. 2008). \n25 ", "ADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \n \nTable 19: Indonesia\u2013Government Expenditures as a Percentage of GDP, 2008 \nExpenditure Item  % Share \n \nCentral Government  Expenditure  14.3 \nPersonnel Expenditure  2.9 \nMaterial Expenditure  2.0 \nInterest Payments  2.4 \nSubsidy  2.9 \nSocial Assistance  1.5 \nOthers  0.5 \nCapital Expenditure  2.1 \nTransfers to Regions  7.1 \nSpecial Autonomy and Adjustment Fund  0.2 \nTotal Central Government and Transfers  21.6 \nNote: GDP = gross domestic product \nSource: Department of Finance Indonesia, 2009   \nAs for infrastructure projects, infrastructure investment in Indonesia currently amounts \nto  approximately  3.4%  of  GDP.  Given  the  deterioration  in  many  infrastructure \nindicators over the past decade, there is an urgent need to upgrade and expand \nexisting  infrastructure.  However,  the  implementation  of  infrastructure  projects  in \nIndonesia has traditionally been hampered by poor budget execution.  \nAccording to the World Bank (2007), actual budget performance in Indonesia has \nroutinely deviated from budget realization indicators. There is an overall problem with \nspending, and while budgets have become larger, the government has been unable to \nspend  the  money  appropriated.  Subsidies  and  transfers  are  substantially \nunderestimated, while realized capital/development expenditures are often lower than \ninitially planned. In addition, Indonesia frequently spends 50% of its capital budget in \nthe final quarter of the year. Project implementation is disrupted by an adverse cycle, \nand in the case of multi-year projects, it is interrupted at the beginning of each year. \nThis  problem  has  worsened  since  Indonesia  pursued  decentralization  in  2001. \nIndonesia currently has one of the most decentralized governments in the world. \nProvincial  and  district  governments  now  manage  more  than  30%  of  total  public \nexpenditure (Table 18) and carry out more than 50% of public investment. The World \nBank  (2007)  notes  that  Indonesia\u2019s  main  development  challenge  is  no  longer  to \ntransfer money to poorer regions, but to ensure that poorer regions spend their money \nwell.  The  largest  item  of  spending  of  sub-national  governments  is  government \nadministration, which absorbs 32% of national expenditures. This has crowded out \nspending in key areas, particularly health, infrastructure, and agriculture.  \nFurthermore,  many  local  governments  have  difficulty  spending  their  additional \nresources. Sub-national governments now have an accumulated level of reserves \nreaching 3% of GDP in 2007. Overall, the World Bank (2007) concludes that public \nfinancial  management  systems  are  weak  and  risks  of  corruption  are  high.  Local \ngovernment performance in the areas of debt investment and external audit, and \ncapacity and human resources have also been found to be extremely weak.  \nFiscal Space and Fiscal Sustainability   \nIndonesia achieved a growth rate of 5.8% in 2008 and a respectable growth rate of 4% \nis forecast for 2009. The forecast deficit is expected to increase by just 0.9% of GDP in \n2009 as a result of the stimulus. Currently, Indonesia has a moderate debt-to-GDP \nratio, of which 55.8% is domestic debt (Table 20). Rupiah-denominated government \nsecurities are the major source of debt financing in Indonesia. Foreign loans are \nmostly from bilateral and multilateral sources. \n26 ", "ADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \nTable 20: Indonesia\u2013Selected Indicators of Fiscal Space, 2008 \nIndicator  Value \nDeficit/GDP  To rise from 1.2% to \n2.1% \nDebt/GDP  33.2% \nCurrent Account/GDP  0.1% \nReserves/GDP   11%  \nReserves to short-term debt  1.4 \nReserves to months of imports  6 months \nFunding   55.8% domestic \nNote: GDP = gross domestic product \nSource: Computed from the IMF International Financial Statistics, various issues \nTable 21: Outstanding Total Central Government Financing of Debt as a \nPercentage of Total Debt as of end 2008 \nYear  % of Total Debt \nExternal Loans  44.2% \nBilateral  29.6 % \nMultilateral  13.2 % \nCommercial  1.3 % \nSuppliers  0.1 % \nGovernment Securities  55.8% \nRupiah Denominated  48.3 % \nSource:  Department of Finance, Indonesia, 2009 \nTo finance the deficit (including the stimulus), it is projected that an additional Rp91.7 \ntrillion will be needed.

The remainder will be raised through \nthe issue of negotiable and non-negotiable government securities in rupiah and foreign \ncurrencies, sold to domestic and foreign investors.  \nThe Indonesian government has held intensive talks with both multilateral and bilateral \ncreditors to provide backup in the form of standby loans, in the event of weak investor \ndemand, as well as greater competition for available funds as other countries embark \non expansionary fiscal policies of their own. Commitments have been secured from \nthe Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, Australia, and Japan via the Japan \nBank for International Corporation. \nOn the upside, an improvement in Indonesia\u2019s tax collection systems has strengthened \nIndonesia\u2019s finances. This is thought to be primarily due to the tax office\u2019s efforts to \ntarget taxpayers in the highly profitable commodity sectors and improve its internal \npersonnel management (World Bank 2007). Given Indonesia\u2019s historical difficulties \nwith budget execution, slippages as far as widening deficits and increasing debt are \nnot likely to cause problems. In fact, by July 2009, the government had only spent \n10.9% of the funds allocated to the expenditure on the budget and the fiscal stimulus \npackage \nGiven the IMF\u2019s annual average GDP growth forecast of 5% in the next five years, the \nprojected debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline slightly, to approximately 27% of \nGDP.

A budget deficit has \nbeen recorded every year since the 1970s, with the exception of small surpluses of \nless  than  1%  between  1994  and  1997.  This  was  achieved  through  privatization \nreceipts and efforts to consolidate spending. After the Asian financial crisis, however, \nthe consolidated budget deficit rose from 1% of GDP in 1997 and peaked at 5.8 % of \nGDP in 2003, while the stock of public debt and contingent liabilities reached the \nequivalent of 137% of GDP. In addition, 30% of total government revenue had to be \nset aside for interest payments, squeezing out spending on essential government \nservices and prompting ratings downgrades and fears about macroeconomic stability \n(Qin et al. 2006).  \nThe country\u2019s high level of debt can be traced back to poor economic governance in \nthe 1970s under the Marcos regime. According to Dohner and Intal (1989), the use of \ngovernment power to gather and distribute wealth worked in three ways during the \nMarcos era. First, the allocation of government contracts and access to credit from \npublic financial institutions were provided in return for some interest or \u201ckickbacks\u201d in \noperations.  Second,  projects  and  contracts  were  also  overpriced  to  generate \n\u201ckickbacks\u201d. The most publicized of these was the Bataan nuclear power contract, \nestimated to be responsible for 10% of the foreign debt. Finally, access to credit was \nprovided to cronies at below market rates and through \u201cbehest\u201d loans.  \nA debt moratorium was declared in 1983, and the Philippines emerged from martial \nlaw in 1986 with an external debt close to 100% of GDP. After the Marcos regime fell \nin 1986, the Aquino government nationalized the external debt inherited from the \nMarcos  regime.  This  dramatically  increased  debt  service  and  domestic  borrowing \nrequirements. Significant increases in public infrastructure further led to higher fiscal \ndeficits. Although the Aquino government formulated tax reform measures, the central \nfeature of which was the implementation of a value added tax in 1988, these changes \ndid not lead to an appreciable rise in the tax revenue as a proportion of GDP.  \n \n28 ", "ADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \nAfter the Asian financial crisis, deficits were initially driven by the national government. \nWhile national government expenditures remained stable at around 19.4% of GDP \nfrom 1997\u20132003, the tax revenue effort declined steadily from 17.0% of GDP to 12.7% \nin 2003. This decline was caused by a chronic inability to collect sufficient revenues \ndue to the weak institutional capacity of tax authorities, complicated and irrational \ntaxation systems, and corruption in revenue collections causing tax evasion (Manasan \n2004). From 2000\u20132004, however, Government Owned and Controlled Corporations \n(GOCCs)  became  the  primary  culprit  behind  the  deficit,  with  the  National  Power \nCorporation (NAPOCOR) being a major driver of the non-financial consolidated public \nsector deficit and debt.  \nIn 2004, the government adopted an aggressive and bold agenda to bring down the \nfiscal deficit over the medium term. The plan centered on achieving a balanced budget \nby 2010 through a range of measures. These included new tax measures; privatization \nand  restructuring  of  GOCCs,  especially  the  power  sector;  improvements  in  tax \nadministration, rationalization of the bureaucracy; and improvements in public debt \nand expenditure management.  \nThe centerpiece of the new tax measures were amendments to expand the coverage \nof the VAT (E-VAT). In 2008, the debt-to-GDP ratio was brought down to 56% of GDP, \na reduction of more than 20% from its peak in 2004. Interest payments on the debt \nhad also declined to 21% of government expenditure.  \n3.3.2  Fiscal Stimulus Packages: Size and Composition of Stimulus, Fiscal \nSpace and Fiscal Sustainability \nSize and Composition of Stimulus \nIn 2007, the Philippines recorded a growth rate of 7.8%, its highest level of growth in \nalmost 25 years. However, growth slowed to 4.6% in 2008 and is forecast to be about \none percent in 2009. \nThe output gap as a percentage of GDP was in the region of plus or minus one \npercent of GDP prior to the crisis (Appendix 7). Estimates of the multiplier based on \nSVAR  show  insignificant  results  for  all  four  lagged  coefficients  of  the  impact  of \ngovernment (Appendix 7). \nGrowth was 0.4% in the first quarter of 2009. Exports declined by 18% in the first \nquarter of 2009, with imports decreasing by about the same proportion. Investment \ndeclined by 16%. Personal consumption expenditure grew by less than one percent \nwhile government consumption was 3.78%.  \nCompared  to  other  countries  in  the  region,  the  Philippines  have  a  high  level  of \npersonal consumption, driven to some extent by remittances from Overseas Filipino \nWorkers (OFWs). Remittances have been resilient in the face of crisis and remain at \nabout 10% of GDP (Table 22). \nTable 22: Philippines\u2013Gross National Product by Expenditure Shares, 2008  \nComponent  % Share \nPersonal Consumption   69.76 \nGovt.

The ERP \nled government to postpone its medium-term balanced budget goal to 2011. \nThe package consists of the following: \n\u2022  P160 billion for increased national government (NG) spending on community \nlevel infrastructure projects and social protection measures;  \n\u2022  P100 billion to finance extra-budgetary infrastructure projects and fund large \ninfrastructure projects.

The  cuts  are  anticipated  to \nincrease investment and consumption by P40 billion. Other measures include a \nP250 million fund for OFWs known as the \u201cpayback\u201d package, designed to \nassist  OFWs  abroad  and  provide  those  returning  with  reintegration  and \nlivelihood assistance. \nPadilla (2009) however, maintains that out of the P160 billion increase in spending, \nonly P50 billion can be considered new funds. This represents the sum realigned from \nservicing debt interest payments in the national budget for 2009. The remaining P110 \nbillion was already a planned increase before the crisis. \nMeanwhile, the second item\u2014the P100 billion allocated for infrastructure projects, a \nportion of which would be bankrolled by government financial institutions and social \nsecurity\u2014could face uncertainties as a portion of the funds is supposed to come from \nprivate investors. This has also been postponed to 2010. \nThe P40 billion tax cuts under the ERP are not new, and are thought to represent the \nestimated additional savings for low and middle income earners and corporations \naccruing from the RVAT.  \nFinally,  the  P30  billion  in  additional  benefits  to  members  of  social  security  and \ninstitutions like the SSS and the GSIS are also uncertain, since these depend on \ninstitutional investments which took a hit when stock markets fell. \nConsequently, the amount that will actually be spent cannot be stated with certainty. \nThe World Bank (2009c) notes that the ERP finely balances the need for fiscal easing. \nOn the one hand, it calls for (i) protecting its poorest and most at risk citizens, (ii) \nboosting the medium-term prospects of the economy (e.g., by relieving infrastructure \nbottlenecks), and (iii) closing the output gap created by the private sector.  On the \nother hand, it recognizes the limited fiscal space available. The latter is mostly the \nresult of the country\u2019s high level of debt, which is easily affected by shocks to GDP \ngrowth and the exchange rate. \nFiscal Space and Fiscal Sustainability   \nOverall, the ERP is projected to increase the deficit as a percentage of GDP to 2.3% in \n2009. \nIn 2009 debt as a percentage of GDP was about 60%, which, while still high, was far \nbelow the peak reached four years earlier, at 78% (Table 23).  \n30 ", "ADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \nTable 23: Philippines\u2013Selected Indicators of Fiscal Sustainability, 2008  \nIndicator  Value \nDeficit/GDP  To rise from -0.9% to -2.3%  \nDebt/GDP  60% as of March 2009 \nCurrent Account/GDP  2.4% \nReserves/GDP   23% \nReserves to short-term debt  4.76 \nReserves to months of imports  5.9 months \nFunding   57% domestic \nNote: GDP = gross domestic product \nSource: Computed from the IMF International Financial Statistics, various issues \nHowever,  the  downside  to  this  is  that  despite  enhanced  revenue  measures,  the \nimproved fiscal outcome was derived mainly from expenditure cuts.

GDP growth has \nslowed to about one percent over the first three quarters of 2009. While spending from \nthe stimulus\u2014which increased by 18.1% in the first half of 2009\u2014provided some \nimpetus to growth, the reduction in revenues by 4% and the blowout in the deficit to \n4.1% limits the further role of fiscal policy in view of the persistently high level of debt \nand interest expenditure in the budget. \n3.4  Singapore  \n3.4.1  A Brief Historical Overview of Fiscal Performance in Singapore  \nAccording to the Singapore Ministry of Finance (2009), fiscal policy in Singapore is \ndirected  primarily  at  promoting  long-term  economic  growth,  rather  than  cyclical \nadjustment or income distribution. Income and company taxes are kept low to attract \nforeign  investment  and  foreign  talent.  Singapore\u2019s  fiscal  conservatism  has  been \nreflected in high structural surpluses, and the overall fiscal balance of the government \nhas been in surplus\u2014as defined by the IMF methodology\u2014since 1988 (Jang and \nNakabayashi 2005). \nIt is useful to think of the Singapore public finance system as consisting of four pillars: \nthe budget sector itself, the Central Provident Fund (CPF), the government investment \nagencies, and other funds (Blondal 2006). \nThe CPF is a mandatory savings scheme financed by payroll contributions from both \nemployees and employers. The combined contribution is currently 33%, with 20% paid \nby the employee and 14.5% paid by the employer. Withdrawal of funds to pay for \nhousing and medical purposes is permitted. The CPF obviates the need of the budget \nsector to finance social services. The CPF also generates large amounts of surplus \ncash flows which are invested in government securities. This explains why Singapore \nhas  high  levels  of  domestic  debt,  despite  continuous  budget  surpluses  and  the \nabsence of debt financing requirements. \nThe government has two principal investment agencies: the Government of Singapore \nInvestment Corporation (GIC) and Temasek Holdings, both of which are answerable to \nthe Ministry of Finance. The GIC acts as a fund manager for the government and \nfocuses on overseas investment of the country\u2019s surpluses in equities, fixed income, \n33 ", "ADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \nmoney market instruments, real estate, and special instruments. Temasek manages \ncorporate shareholdings both in Singapore and abroad. Its corporate profile includes a \nwide range of sectors, and several of the companies are listed on stock markets in \nSingapore and overseas. \nThere  are  several  other  funds  which  are  not  consolidated  in  the  budget  but  are \ngoverned by specific acts. These include the Government Securities Fund, where the \nCPF  invests  its  surplus  funds.  The  interest  paid  to  the  CPF  is  netted  against \ninvestment income earned by the government agencies; thus the budget sector does \nnot show any interest expenses paid.  \nThe  Singapore  constitution  contains  three  key  fiscal  rules  governing  fiscal \nresponsibility and sustainability in the country. First, the government should not draw \nupon resources accumulated during previous terms of office. This means that deficits \nin any year must be balanced by surpluses accumulated in earlier years during its term \nin office. Second, the government may only consider as revenue for these purposes \nup to half of the annual net investment income from the accumulated reserves. Third, \nthe government may engage in deficit financing and draw on past reserves if consent \nis given by both the Parliament and the President. This is known in Singapore as the \n\u201ctwo-key\u201d safety mechanism.  \nUnlike  other countries  in  this study, and  indeed  the  developing  world  in general, \nSingapore has no external debt or expenditure on subsidies and interest payments. \nFurthermore, unlike a lot of OECD countries, its spending on social security is minimal, \ndespite being a high income country with a rapidly aging society. Individual savings for \nold age is seen as the responsibility of the individual through compulsory savings with \nthe CPF. The family is also expected to play its part. The Maintenance of Parents Act \npassed in 1995 allows for parents over the age of 60 to apply to a tribunal for an order \nfor their offspring to provide support. Support from the community, mainly through \ncharities, is seen as a last resort. \n3.4.2  Fiscal Stimulus Packages: Size and Composition of Stimulus, Fiscal \nSpace and Fiscal Sustainability \nSize and Composition of Stimulus \nSingapore\u2019s economy was one of the first to contract sharply at the end of 2008, with \nGDP falling by 4.2% in the fourth quarter. The output gap as a percentage of GDP was \nin the region of plus or minus one percent of GDP prior to the crisis (Appendix 8). A \nnegative growth rate of between 5 and 7% of GDP has been forecast for 2009, leaving \na large output gap of at more than 10% of GDP. Estimates of the multiplier based on \nSVAR  show  insignificant  results  for  all  four  lagged  coefficients  of  the  impact  of \ngovernment expenditure on output.  \nSingapore\u2019s GDP experienced the sharpest contraction in the first quarter of 2009, \nfalling  by  9.5%.  Exports  fell  by  21%,  and  imports  by  19.2%.  Gross  fixed  capital \nformation also contracted sharply by 15.5%.

Smaller amounts were targeted as \nsupport for families. Overall, the response was skewed in favor of businesses, at the \nexpense  of  those  employees  made  redundant.  All  payments  and  credits  were \ndisbursed  in  a  timely  manner  in  2009.  Increases  in  government  consumption \nexpenditure were the only positive items of expenditure playing a timely and significant \nrole in preventing an even sharper contraction. \nFiscal Space and Fiscal Sustainability   \nWith large current account surpluses and official reserves, as well as undisclosed \namounts  of  government  assets  and  no  debt,  there  is  little  doubt  that  Singapore \npossesses vast fiscal space (Table 29).

Accordingly, the case was made to the President for the \ncost of these measures to be funded from the past reserves, on the grounds that the \ncircumstances faced were exceptional. The President gave his assent. It was also felt \nthat tapping on past reserves provided flexibility to respond to future uncertainties. \nOf  all  the  countries  included  in  this  study,  Singapore  is  in  the  best  position  to \nundertake a fiscal stimulus in response to the global financial crisis. Singapore\u2019s fiscal \nstimulus challenges stem from the limits of fiscal policy in a highly open economy with \na high savings rates. In the longer term, however, Singapore will need to rebalance its \neconomy. This will mean an increase in consumption and less export orientation. With \nits small population, Singapore will always have to be export-oriented in order to \nsurvive. There is scope for a more consumption-oriented economy, but this will require \na fundamental shift in the Singapore economic model, which has been one of the most \nsuccessful in the world. \nSingapore has a very high savings rate of about 43% of GDP, a result of household, \ngovernment, and corporate savings. Although the current level of contribution to the \nCPF for individuals is high, it is generally considered inadequate to retire on, given that \nmuch of it is also withdrawn for other purposes prior to retirement, particularly housing \nand health. Individuals have to save over and above this amount as there is no \nuniversal pension, and state expenditure on health is low, particularly given a rapidly \naging population. Thus, for social security to be provided by the state\u2014something \nwhich most economies at Singapore\u2019s level of per capita GDP are already doing\u2014\nspace  must  be  found  within  the  current  budget  outlays  and  revenue  must  be \nincreased, otherwise the state will have to run lower budget surpluses. \nCurrently, the largest item of expenditure in the Singapore budget is defense, which is \na strategic priority of the government (Ghesquiere 2007). There is mandatory national \nservice for all male citizens and permanent residents aged 18. Thus, if space is to be \nfound in the budget for social security spending, this would be the obvious item for \nreconsideration (Table 30). \n38 ", "ADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \n \nTable 30: Singapore\u2013National Expenditure by Sector and Ministry, 2008 \n(%) \nSector/Ministry  % Share \nSocial Development  42.2 \n  Education  21.5 \n  Health   7.0 \n  National Development  5.7 \n  Community Development,   3.6 \n  Youth and Sports \n  Environment and Water Resources  2.07 \n  Information, Communications and the Arts  1.9 \nSecurity and External Relations   37.7 \n  Defense  28.8 \n  Home Affairs  7.8 \n  Foreign Affairs  1.1 \nEconomic Development  16.1 \n  Transport  7.3 \n  Trade and Industry  6.7 \n  Manpower  1.9 \n  Info-communications and Media     0.2 \nDevelopment \nGovernment Administration  3.8 \n  Finance   1.6 \n  Organs of the State  0.8 \n  Law  0.8 \n  Prime Minister\u2019s Office  0.6 \nTOTAL EXPENDITURE  100.0 \n Source: Ministry of Finance, Singapore 2009 \nSingapore\u2019s tax revenue was only 13% of GDP in 2008, compared to 31%in the \nmedian OECD country.

As for corporate taxes, no tax \nis payable for the first SGD100,000 dollars; a tax rate of 8.5% applies to amounts up to \nSGD$300,000, and a 17% flat rate applies to amounts over SGD300,000. Low taxes \nfor individuals and corporations have been useful in attracting foreign investment and \ntalent as well as keeping the incentive to work high. However, it also renders the tax \nsystem less able to act as an automatic stabiliser. \nThere is scope for a gradual shift to providing a state-funded social safety net for the \nelderly and poor, if the goal of high cumulative surpluses is replaced with one of \nbalancing the budget over the business cycle. However, this will require a fundamental \nchange in ideology. \n4.  CONCLUSION \nThis study examined some of the fiscal policy issues and challenges confronted by \ndeveloping countries in using countercyclical fiscal policy to ameliorate the impact of \nthe global financial crisis. A case study approach examined the experience of four \ndeveloping Asian countries and revealed a rich diversity both in terms of the size and \ncomposition of fiscal stimulus and the challenges which are confronted.  \nThe case for discretionary fiscal policy is unequivocal, given that automatic stabilizing \nimpulses are weak. On the expenditure side, this is mainly due to the absence of \nsocial safety nets embedded into the expenditure side of the budget. This may be less \npronounced on the revenue side, as revenues decline with slower economic activity. \nHowever, this decline may not be as pronounced as in developed countries, since the \nproportion of revenues derived from income taxes is much lower. Thus, employing tax \n40 ", "ADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \ncuts  as  a  major  component  of  a  fiscal  package\u2014while  quickly  and  easily \nimplemented\u2014may not be effective. \nCountries such as Indonesia, which have relied on tax cuts as a major component of \nits fiscal package, face a number of difficulties stemming primarily from the high level \nof labor market informality. Microeconomic reforms in this arena can spur growth by \nincreasing productivity and improving the effectiveness of fiscal policy, thus rendering \nit less regressive. In the case of others which have employed either corporate or \npersonal tax cuts, the impact is muted because tax rates were low in the first place. \nAttention needs to be focused on tax reforms in this area. \nSince  automatic  stabilizing  impulses  are  weak,  it  is  imperative  that  spending \nassociated with the fiscal stimulus be disbursed quickly, both to reduce the severity of \nthe crisis as well to avoid the procyclical impacts of fiscal policy. In countries such as \nIndonesia, which have longstanding problems with budget execution, or Malaysia, \nwhere  spending  has  been  slower  than  anticipated,  direct  cash  handouts  to  poor \nhouseholds could be considered. \nThe  lack  of  fiscal  space  and  fiscal  sustainability  issues  also  present  serious \nconstraints. This has been a key issue for the Philippines and, to a lesser extent, \nMalaysia. In the Philippines, increased expenditure in the short-term must be weighed \nagainst long standing concerns on fiscal sustainability. Increasing tax revenues is \nparamount,  both  in  terms  of  increasing  expenditure  on  social  services  and \nsafeguarding fiscal sustainability.  \nIn  the  Malaysian  case,  fiscal  space  can  be  created  within  the  budget  through  a \nreduction in subsidies and better targeting of subsidies to the poor. In the longer term, \nattention should be focused on reducing reliance on petroleum revenues, introducing \nthe VAT, trimming the size of the public sector and public financial enterprises, and \nrefraining from producing chronic budget deficits. \nThe impact of expansionary fiscal policy has also been muted by the structure of the \neconomy, particularly in the case of highly open economies with low consumption, \nsuch as Singapore and Malaysia. In this case, policies to rebalance growth towards \nmore domestic consumption should be seriously considered. In the case of Malaysia, \nrecent initiatives to liberalize the services sector should be pursued more vigorously. \nMoving away from an export mindset and reviewing fiscal incentives provided for \nexports should also be conducted. Increased consumption would be encouraged if \nmore social safety nets were provided. In the case of Singapore, the fiscal space to \nprovide state funded social safety nets can realistically be accomplished if budgets \nwere balanced over the cycle. \nIn summary, this study identifies several steps that countries might take to improve the \nimpact of expansionary fiscal policy in response to future downturns. These include (i) \nembedding automatic stabilizing impulses through the provision of social safety nets; \n(ii) increasing tax revenues collected from personal and corporate taxes by reducing \nlabor  market  informality  through  improvements  in  the  business  environment;  (iii) \nsafeguarding  fiscal  sustainability;  (iv)  rebalancing  growth  by  strengthening  other \nsectors of the economy; (v) reducing expenditures on subsidies; and (vi) ensuring \nsmooth and efficient budget execution. \n41 ", "ADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \nREFERENCES  \nAugustina, C., J.
