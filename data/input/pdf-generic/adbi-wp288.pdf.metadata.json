This  study  identifies  some  of  the  issues  and  policy  implications \nassociated  with  this  policy  response  in  developing  countries.  Included  are  case  studies  of \nfour  developing  countries  in  the  Asian  region\u2014Malaysia,  Indonesia,  the  Philippines,  and \nSingapore.  The  findings  point  to  a  rich  diversity  in  both  the  size  and  composition  of  fiscal \nstimulus  and  the  challenges  which  are  confronted.  This  study  suggests  several  steps  that \ncountries might take to improve the impact of expansionary fiscal policy in response to future \ndownturns. These include (i) embedding automatic stabilizing impulses through the provision \nof  social  safety  nets;  (ii)  increasing  tax  revenues  collected  from  personal  and  corporate \ntaxes,  by  reducing  labor  market  informality  through  improvements  in  the  business \nenvironment; (iii) safeguarding fiscal sustainability; (iv) rebalancing growth by strengthening \nother  sectors  of  the  economy;  (v)  reducing  expenditures  on  subsidies;  and  (vi)  ensuring \nsmooth and efficient budget execution. \n\n \nJEL Classification: E60, E61, E62, E63\n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \nContents \n\nIntroduction ................................................................................................................ 3 \n\nCountercyclical Fiscal Policy in Response to Crisis in Developing Countries ............. 3 \n\nCase Studies ............................................................................................................. 9 \n\n3.1  Malaysia .......................................................................................................... 9 \n3.2 \nIndonesia ....................................................................................................... 18 \n3.3  The Philippines .............................................................................................. 28 \n3.4  Singapore ...................................................................................................... 33 \n\n4. \n\nConclusion ............................................................................................................... 40 \n\nReferences ......................................................................................................................... 42 \n\nAppendix 1: Malaysia\u2019s First Stimulus Package, November 2008 ....................................... 46 \n\nAppendix 2: Malaysia\u2019s Second Stimulus Package, March 2009 ......................................... 47 \n\nAppendix 3: Services Sub-sectors for Liberalization under Malaysia\u2019s First Fiscal Stimulus \nPackage .............................................................................................................................. 50 \n\nAppendix 4a: Malaysia\u2014Output Gap as a Percentage of Potential GDP, 2000\u20132008 ......... 52 \n\nAppendix 4b:  Malaysia\u2014Estimates of Multiplier from VAR ................................................. 53 \n\nAppendix 5: Indonesia\u2019s Fiscal Stimulus for Labor-Intensive Infrastructure ......................... 54 \n\nAppendix 6a: Indonesia\u2014Output Gap as a Percentage of Potential GDP, 2000\u20132008 ....... 55 \n\nAppendix 6b:  Indonesia\u2014Estimates of Multiplier from VAR ............................................... 56 \n\nAppendix 7a: Philippines\u2014Output Gap as a Percentage of Potential GDP, 2000-2008 ...... 57 \n\nAppendix 7b:  Philippines\u2014Estimates of Multiplier from VAR .............................................. 58 \n\nAppendix 8a: Singapore\u2014Output Gap as a Percentage of Potential GDP, 2000\u20132008 ....... 59 \n\nAppendix 8b:  Singapore\u2014Estimates of Multiplier from VAR ............................................... 60 \n\n \n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \n\n1.  INTRODUCTION \n\nFor  more  than  twenty  years  prior  to  the  global  financial  crisis,  volatility  in  aggregate \neconomic  activity  and  inflation  fell  dramatically  in  most  of  the  industrial  world.  The \nwidespread  and  persistent  nature  of  this  phenomenon  was  termed  \u201cthe  great \nmoderation\u201d.  The  most  common  explanations  put  forward  for  this  include  better \nmonetary  policy,  structural  changes  in  inventory  management,  and  good  luck  (see \nBernanke  2004;  Blanchard  and  Simon  2000;  Summers  2005).  The  role  played  by \nmonetary policy led to a consensus that stabilization should be left to monetary policy, \nwith  a  focus  on  inflation.  Fiscal  policy,  on  the  other  hand,  should  rely  on  automatic \nstabilizers, with discretionary fiscal policy best avoided. \n\nThis  consensus  was  cast  aside  in  the  wake  of  the  recent  global  financial  crisis,  with \ncountries  around  the  world  adopting  unprecedented  fiscal  stimulus  packages  to \nmitigate  the  impacts  of  the  crisis.  This  response  hinged  on  the  premise  that  the \nmonetary  policy  transmission  mechanism  would  be  less  effective  in  the  current \nclimate,  with  considerable  deleveraging  taking  place.  In  addition,  further  easing  in \nsome cases would be limited as policy rates are already close to the zero bound. \n\nA critical question in this discourse is whether monetary policy has become ineffective. \nIn  some  Asian  countries,  an  activist  monetary  policy  has  not  been  attempted.  If \nexchange rates  are  pegged\u2014whether  de facto or  de jure\u2014then  interest  rates  cannot \nbe  lowered.  In  this  instance,  maintaining  exchange  rate  stability  precludes  reducing \npolicy  rates  as  a  policy  option.  While  declines  in  policy  rates  were  widely  observed, \nthese  also  reflect  declines  in  the  expected  rates  of  inflation.  In the  case  of  Malaysia, \nfor  example,  Zeilesis  Shah,  and  Patnaik  (2010)  found  high  exchange  rate  inflexibility \nand  no  structural  break  in  the  exchange  rate  regime  when  faced  with  the  crisis.  It  is \nthus  likely  that  monetary  policy  was  not  part  of  the  stabilization  measures  adopted \nduring the crisis. \n\nThe  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  identify  some  of  the  issues  and  policy  implications \nassociated  with  the  fiscal  policy  response  to  global  financial  crisis  in  developing \ncountries. This is done by undertaking case studies of four developing countries in the \nAsian region, i.e., Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Singapore.  \n\nThe first section provides an overview of the literature on countercyclical fiscal policy in \ndeveloping countries, and a brief survey of the fiscal stimulus packages of countries in \nthe  Asian  region.  This  is  followed  by  a  discussion  of  some  of  the  econometric \nchallenges associated with gauging the appropriate size of fiscal stimulus packages. \n\nThe second section documents and evaluates the fiscal policy responses undertaken \nby Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Singapore. Each case study begins with a \nbrief  historical  overview  of  fiscal  performance.  This  is  followed  by  an  analysis  of  the \nfiscal stimulus packages (in terms of both the size and composition), fiscal space, and \nfiscal  sustainability.  The  third  section  concludes  by  summarizing  the  fiscal  policy \nchallenges encountered by the countries and discussing the policy implications of the \nfindings. \n\n2.  COUNTERCYCLICAL FISCAL POLICY IN RESPONSE \n\nTO CRISIS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES  \n\nThere  is  considerable  debate  about  the  efficacy  of  discretionary  fiscal  policy  in \ndeveloping  countries.  While  automatic  stabilizers  are  weak  and  make  the  case  for \ndiscretion,  there  is  also  the  widely  noted  occurrence  of  \u201cprocyclicality\u201d.  Kraay  and \nServen  (2008)  state  that  procyclicality  applies  to  a  wide  variety  of  measures.  These \n\n3 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \ninclude  total  expenditure,  the  share  of  total  expenditure  in  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP),  public  consumption,  and  public  investment.  Recent  evidence  (Gavin  and \nPerotti  1997;  Kaminsky,  Reinhart,  and  Veigh  2004)  suggests  that  this  correlation \nreflects a mistiming of fiscal interventions. \n\nExplanations  have  also  been  put  forward  in  terms  of  imperfections  in  credit  markets \nthat  prevent  developing  countries  from  borrowing  in  bad  times  (Kaminsky,  Reinhart, \nand Veigh 2004). On the other hand, political economy explanations espouse the idea \nthat good times encourage fiscal profligacy and/or rent seeking activities (Tornell and \nLane  1999).  The  procyclicality  of  fiscal  policy  implies  that  discretionary  fiscal \n.  Additional  volatility \ninterventions  tend  to  increase  rather  than  reduce  output  volatility\ninduced by procyclical fiscal policy has been found to undermine growth in the long run \n(Fatas and Mihov 2003). \n\nFurther,  Kraay  and  Severn  (2008)  assert  that  the  expansionary  effect  of  fiscal  policy \ntends to be much smaller in developing countries than in developed ones. Thus, it  is \nrisky to extrapolate lessons from implementing countercyclical fiscal policy in the latter \nto  make  policy  recommendations  for  the  former.  Overall,  Kraay  and  Severn  (2008) \nevidence  on  the  short-  and  long-run  impact  of  fiscal  expansions  on \nconclude  that \naggregate demand and output in developing countries is mixed. \n\nMoreover,  there  is  little  consensus  on  what  a  fiscal  stimulus  package  is  expected  to \nachieve.  As  Hannoun  (2009)  states,  there  are  two  stylized  types  of  policy  response: \nstabilization  and  stimulation.  A  measured  stabilization  policy  accepts  the  fact  that \nadjustment is inescapable and therefore merely aims to mitigate the pain and promote \nan  orderly  adjustment.  Stimulation,  on  the  other  hand,  aims  to  eliminate  the \nadjustment period  altogether, and therefore involves a much larger stimulus package.  \n\nBlanchard et al. (2008) contend that the optimal fiscal package should be timely, large, \nlasting, diversified, contingent, collective, and sustainable. It should be timely, because \nthe need for action is immediate; large, because the current and expected decrease in \nprivate demand is exceptionally large; lasting because the downturn will last for some \ntime;  diversified  because  of  the  unusual  degree  of  uncertainty  associated  with  any \nsingle  measure;  contingent,  because  the  need  to  reduce  the  perceived  probability  of \nanother \u201cGreat  Depression\u201d  requires  a  commitment  to  do more,  if  needed;  collective, \nsince each country that has fiscal space should contribute; and sustainable, so as not \nIt is likely that, \nto lead to a debt explosion and adverse reactions of financial markets. \nexcept for a few countries, this wish list would be mutually exclusive.  \n\nThere  are  also  contradictory  views  on  ideal  the  characteristics  of  optimal  fiscal \nstimulus  packages,  such  as  their  being  timely,  temporary,  and  targeted  (Summers \n2008)  or  permanent,  pervasive,  and  predictable  (Taylor  2008).  Taylor  maintains  that, \nbased  on  the  permanent  income  theory  or  life  cycle  theory,  temporary  increases  in \nincome will not lead to significant increases in consumption. Further, he argues that an \nacross-the-board approach is far more effective than targeting. Finally, Taylor argues \nthat government policy has been too erratic; it should be as predictable as possible so \nthat individuals and firms know what to expect. \n\nCountries have announced fiscal rescue packages of varying sizes, with the People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC)  announcing  the  biggest  total  package  as  a  percentage  of \nGDP,  followed  by  Saudi  Arabia,  Malaysia,  and  the  United  States.  For  2009,  the \neconomic stimulus announced by 32 countries (including all the G20) as a percentage \nof  global  GDP  is  1.4%,  with  close  to  90%  of  the  global  stimulus  coming  from  G20 \nnations (see Khatiwada 2009). \n\n \n\nKhatiwada (2009) notes that the focus of stimulus packages varies between advanced \nand  developing  economies.  Infrastructure  spending  comprises  46.5%  of  stimulus \n\n4 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \npackages  in  developing  and  emerging  economies,  compared  to  14.9%  in  advanced \neconomies.  Meanwhile,  tax  cuts  comprise  over  34%  of  fiscal  stimulus  in  advanced \neconomies,  while  these  comprise  only  3%  in  developing  and  emerging  economies. \nSocial transfers to low-income citizens comprise a relatively small percentage for both \ngroups: 10.8% in advanced and 6.8% in developing and emerging countries.  \n\nNoticeably absent is the rationale for the composition of the fiscal stimulus packages. \nI\nnfrastructure  spending  features  strongly  as  a  major  item  of  expenditure,  and \ncomprises  more  than  60%  of  stimulus  packages  in  Thailand,  the  Philippines,  the \nRepublic of Korea (hereafter Korea), and PRC (Table 1). However, it is not clear why \nthis  should  be  the major focus  of fiscal  stimulus,  if  the  aim  is to  increase  the  level of \naggregate demand in a timely, temporary, and targeted manner.  \n\nTable 1: Features of Fiscal Stimulus Package: Three Major Items of Expenditure \n\n \n\nCountry \n\nIndonesia \nMalaysia \n\nPhilippines \nPRC \nRepublic of Korea \nThailand \nIndia \n\nInfrastructure \nX \n \n\nTax Breaks \nX \n \n\nTransfers \n \n \n\nX \nX \nX \n \nX \n\nX \n \nX \nX \n \n\n \n \nX \nX \n \n\nOther \n\nWaived import duties \nGuarantee funds, equity \ninvestment \nGeneral increase in budget \nHealth care reform \n \nEducation \nhome loans, export \nincentives \n\nNote: PRC=People\u2019s Republic of China  \n\nSource: Author\u2019s estimates \n\nIn Asia, there appears to be wide variation in terms of the size of the stimulus (Table \n2).  Most  Asian  countries  announced  fiscal  stimulus  packages  without  providing  a \ndetailed  justification  for  the  magnitude  of  spending.  PRC  has  rolled  out  the  largest \npackage,  despite  projections  which  predict  a  smaller  decline  in  its  GDP  relative  to \nother  Asian  countries.  There  is  little  doubt  that  PRC  possesses  the  fiscal  space  to \nundertake this ambitious fiscal stimulus. \n\n5 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \n \n\nTable 2: Fiscal Stimulus Packages in Selected Asian Economies \n\n \n\nCountry \n\nForecast \ndrop in \nGDP* \n\nStimulus/GD\nP, 2008 (%) \n\nDeficit \n2008/GD\nP \n(%) \n\nDeficit \n2009/GD\nP \n(%) \n\nDebt/G\nDP, \n2008 \n(%) \n\nCurrent \nAccount \nBalance/G\nDP (%) \n2008 \n\nIndonesia \nMalaysia \nPhilippines \nPRC \nRepublic of Korea \nThailand*** \nIndia \n\n1.2 \n10 \n4.1 \n13 \n12.8 \n1.1 \n4.2 \nNotes: GDP = gross domestic product; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China; * measures the difference in IMF\u2019s \nGDP forecasts between 2008 and the 2009; ** estimate as a result of implementing the stimulus as \nannounced by country authorities; *** new package of more than 17% of GDP over three years   \n\n-3.6 \n-7.3 \n-4.6 \n-2.5 \n-6.2 \n-10 \n   -3.2 \n\n33 \n42.5 \n56 \n17.6 \n33 \n33.6 \n82 \n\n-0.1 \n-4.8 \n-0.9 \n-0.4 \n0.3 \n-1.1 \n8.4 \n\n-2.1 \n-7.6 \n-2.3 \n-3.2 \n-6.5 \n-6 \n10 \n\n0.2 \n17.6 \n2.5 \n10.1 \n-0.4 \n-0.1 \n-3 \n\nSource(s):   Khatiwada (2009); International Financial Statistics (IMF) \n\nOwing to their strong export orientation, Malaysia and Korea are projected to suffer a \nlarge  decline  in  GDP,  and  have  thus  also  announced  large fiscal  stimulus  packages. \nWith  far  less  fiscal  space,  the  Philippines,  which  has  drastically  reduced  its  debt \nrecently, announced a stimulus amounting to 4.1% of GDP. Indonesia is still projected \nto grow fairly strongly, and has announced a modest stimulus of 1.2% of GDP. \n\nThe scope for countercyclical fiscal policy is usually assessed in developed countries \nby  estimating  the  output  gap  and  the  role  of  automatic  stabilizers.  In  the  case  of \ndeveloping  countries,  however,  it  is  difficult  to  measure  the  output  gap  estimate \nprecisely.  This  is  due  to  data  limitations,  structural  breaks  in  time  series,  and \nexogenous  factors  which  have  large  impacts  on  the  economy,  owing  to  a  lack  of \ndiversification in the economic structure (Mueller, Yackovlev, and Weisfeld 2009). It is \ntherefore difficult to gauge which variables fiscal policy should target.  \n\nIn  deciding  on  the  size  of  fiscal  packages,  the  ideal  would  be  to  estimate  the  output \ngap  and  multiplier  effects  of  different  types  of  government  expenditure  and  perhaps \nthe lag time involved for the impacts. An estimate of fiscal sustainability should also be \nobtained.  As  already  noted,  while  output  gaps  are  routinely  calculated  for  developed \ncountries, this is not the case for developing countries.  \n\nThere  is  an  ample  literature  on  ways  to  measure  potential  output  and  output  gaps. \nGerlach and Yiu (2004) assert that these may be usefully thought of as either following \nan a theoretical approach, a structural approach, or a mixed approach. The theoretical \napproach is primarily a statistical exercise in which actual data on output are used to \nestimate  potential  output.  The  most  frequently  used  approaches  are  the  (HP)  filter \nproposed  by  Hodrick  and  Prescott  (1997),  the  band-pass  (BP)  filter  proposed  by \nBaxter and King (1999), and the (BN) filter proposed by Beveridge and Nelson (1981).  \n\nThe  structural  approach  has  the  appeal  of  being  informed  by  economic  theory  in \nestimating potential output. Typically, data on employment and estimates of the capital \nstock are used to fit a production function. Given assumptions about \u201cnormal\u201d levels of \nemployment, productivity, and the utilization of the capital stock, measures of potential \noutput  can  be  constructed.  While  the  guidance  of  theory  is  attractive,  the  data \nrequirements  are  quite  demanding.  Furthermore,  poor  estimates  of  the  output  gap \ncould arise from a misspecification of the production function.  \n\nA  third  approach  combines  a  time series  model with  structural  economic  information. \nKuttner (1994) uses an Unobserved Components model and data on actual output and \n\n6 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \ninflation  to  estimate  the  output  gap  in  the  US.  While  this  approach  is  attractive,  a \ncritical  assumption  is  that  the  relationship  between  the  output  gap  and  inflation  is \nstable  during  the  sample  period.  This  assumption  may  be  particularly  debatable  in \neconomies that have experienced large structural changes. \n\nIn  this  paper,  the  output  gap  is  estimated  using  the  HP  filter  for  generating  the \npotential  GDP  figures  for  the  period  2000\u20132008,  using  annual  real  GDP  figures.  As \nCerra and Saxena (2000) observe, the HP is a simple smoothing procedure that has \nbecome increasingly popular because of its flexibility in tracking the characteristics of \nthe fluctuations in trend output. Trend output (denoted by \u03c4 ) is derived using the HP \nfilter and is obtained by minimizing a combination of the gap between actual output (y) \nand  trend  output  and  the  rate  of  change  in  trend  output  for  the  whole  sample  of \nobservations (T): \n\nmin \n\n \n\nWhere \u03bb determines the degree of smoothness of the trend. \n\nThe  shortcomings  of  the  HP  filter  have  been  well  documented.  A  major  drawback \ncomes from the difficulty in identifying the appropriate \u201cdetrending\u201d parameter \u03bb, which \nis  generally  overlooked  by  using  arbitrary  values  popularized  by  the  real  business \ncycle  literature.  Mechanical  detrending  based  on  the  HP  filter  can  lead  to  spurious \ncyclicality  with  the  integrated  or  nearly  integrated  time  series  and  an  excessive \nsmoothing  of  structural  breaks.  A  second  important  flaw  is  the  end-sample  biases. \nThese reflect the symmetric trending objective of the method across the whole sample \nand the different constraints that apply within the sample and the edges. \n\nto  calculate \n\nIn  a  survey  of  the  literature  on  multipliers,  Spilimbergo,  Symansky,  and  Schindler \n(2009) note that there is wide disagreement on the reliability of multipliers, due in part \nto  methodological  differences.  There  are  four  broad  methodologies  that  have  been \nused \nfiscal  multipliers.  These  are  model  simulations,  Vector \nAutoregressions  (VARs),  econometric  studies  of  consumer  behavior  in  response  to \nfiscal  shocks,  and  case  studies.  All  of  these  methodologies  have  limitations. \nFurthermore,  they  note  that  the  range  of  estimates  for  even  similar  methodologies  is \nlarge.  \n\nThis study applies a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) framework based on the \nmethodology  developed  by  Blanchard  and  Perotti  (2002)  to  estimate  multipliers.  It \nassumes  that  as  discretionary  fiscal  decisions  take  time  to  implement  (because  of \npolitical and legislative requirements), the short-term (i.e., within one quarter) reaction \nof  fiscal  variables  to  current  economic  developments  only  reflect  \u201cautomatic\u201d \nresponses defined by existing laws and regulations. Fiscal developments adjusted for \nthese automatic/cyclical responses are, therefore, assumed to represent discretionary \nstructural  fiscal  policy  shocks.  The  study  uses  logged  quarterly  seasonally  adjusted \ndata  for  the  period  2000  to  2008  and  assesses  the  impact  of  a  change  in  total \ngovernment expenditure on GDP. \n\nLag  lengths  for  the  SVAR  framework  were  selected  by  the  model  with  the  lowest \nSchwartz  Information  Criterion  (SIC)  statistic  if  it  displayed  no  autocorrelation  using \nthe Lagrange-multiplier (LM) test.  \n\nIn summary, several shortcomings have been identified with the methodology adopted \nin this paper. The results from these estimations are therefore not discussed at length, \nas they should not be viewed as precise and reliable. Future directions for research in \nthis area should be directed at estimates of output gaps and multipliers using different \nmethodologies and data. \n\n7 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \n \n\nfiscal  stimulus  packages, \n\nIn  assessing \nfiscal  sustainability \nconsiderations  are  paramount.

CASE STUDIES \n\n3.1  Malaysia  \n\n3.1.1  A Brief Historical Overview of Fiscal Performance in Malaysia \n\nDuring  the  1970s,  the  Malaysian  government  used  revenues  from  newly  discovered \npetroleum reserves to support high levels of public expenditure without a dramatic rise \nin  debt.  Much  of  this  funding  was  directed  at  expanding  state  owned  enterprises, \nwhich  were  at  the  forefront  of  Malaysia\u2019s  ethnic  restructuring  efforts  as  envisaged  in \nthe New Economic Policy (NEP). In fact, fiscal policy in Malaysia has been inextricably \nlinked to the NEP since its commencement in 1970. \n\nIn the early 1980s, commodity prices declined as a result of a recession triggered by \nthe  US-led  tightening  of  liquidity.  As  a  result,  Malaysia\u2019s  terms  of  trade  fell  by  17%, \nand its current account deficit widened to 14% of GDP in 1982. Government counter-\ncyclical  policy  to  offset  the  deflationary  effects  of  the  downturn  resulted  in  soaring \npublic expenditure and a deficit of 19% of GDP (Table 3). \n\nTable 3: Malaysia\u2013Debt, Deficit and Current Account Ratios to GDP  \n\n1981\u20131988 \n\nTotal Debt/GDP  \n(%) \n\nDeficit /GDP  \n(%) \n\nCurrent Account/GDP  \n(%) \n\nYear \n\n1981 \n1982 \n1983 \n1984 \n1985 \n1986 \n1987 \n1988 \n\n  56.0 \n  70.1 \n  78.9 \n  78.1 \n  89.0 \n112.3 \n110.8 \n103.8 \n\n-19.1 \n-17.9 \n-13.2 \n-08.9 \n-07.4 \n-10.6 \n-07.8 \n-04.3 \n\n-09.9 \n-13.5 \n-11.6 \n-04.8 \n-02.0 \n-0.40 \n8.1 \n5.2 \n\nGDP = gross domestic product \n\nSource: Bank Negara Malaysia Annual Report, various issues \n\nAfter  the  elections  in  1982,  when  it  became  apparent  that  the  recession  would  last \nlonger  than  expected,  the  government  decided  to  cut  back  on  spending.  However, \nthese cuts did not affect borrowing for developing heavy industries through the Heavy \nIndustries  Corporation  of  Malaysia  (HICOM).  HICOM  pursued  a  heavy  industrial \nprogram,  collaborating  with  foreign  companies  in  developing  a  range  of  industries. \nThese included cement, steel, and automobile manufacturing. HICOM\u2019s activities were \nmainly financed by massive foreign borrowing from Japanese sources. \n\nIn 1985, Malaysia experienced its first recession as its major export earners slowed. In \n1986, the economy slumped altogether. The prices of tin, petroleum, and rubber were \nalmost half their 1984 values, and the debt-to-GDP ratio peaked soon afterwards. This \ntime  the  government  was  not  in  a  position  to  use  counter-cyclical  policy,  and \nprivatization  and  liberalization  of  foreign  direct  investment  were  undertaken  instead. \nHowever,  it  was  a  sustained  boom  led  by  export-oriented  manufacturing  and  the \nrelocation of production from East Asia that eventually led to a decline in the debt-to-\nGDP ratio.  \n\nThe  debt-to-GDP  ratio  bottomed  out  in  years  just  prior  to  the  Asian  financial  crisis \n(Table  4), but  this  decline  was  short-lived.  In fact,  Malaysia  has  consistently  incurred \ndeficits since 1970, except for small surpluses for three years prior to the crisis when \n\n9 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \nhigh growth rates were achieved.

This was announced \nunder  the  former  Prime  Minister  who  was  due  to  step  down  in  March  2009. \nApproximately 85% of this package was directed towards improving infrastructure.  \n\nThe construction sector welcomed the package, but other sectors were unimpressed. \nNo  assistance  was  forthcoming  for  the  vulnerable  or  those  made  redundant.  The \npackage  was  skewed  towards  those  employed,  particularly  in  the  public  sector. \nCurrently,  the  ratio  of  public  servants  to  the  overall  population  in  Malaysia  is  4.7%\u2014\none  of  the  highest  in  the  region\u2014and  wages  and  salaries  of  public  servants  is  the \nbiggest item of expenditure by function in the budget (see Table 10). \n\nThe  second  fiscal  stimulus  package  was  announced  in  March  2009,  soon  after  the \ncurrent  Prime  Minister  and  Finance  Minister  assumed  office  (see  Appendix  2).  The \npackage,  intended  to  be  spent  over  two  years,  amounts  to  RM60  billion  or \napproximately  9%  of  GDP.

The  output  gap  as  a \npercentage of GDP was in the region of plus or minus one percent of GDP prior to the \ncrisis (see Appendix 4). Currently, a negative growth rate of between 3.5 and 4.5% of \nGDP has been forecast, leaving a large output gap of at least 7% of GDP.  \n\nMultiplier  estimates  based  on  SVAR  show  significant  results  for  all  four  lagged \ncoefficients of the impact of government expenditure on output. This indicates that the \nlong-run  multiplier,  which  is  a  summation  of  all  the  significant  lagged  coefficients,  is \nabout  0.35.  Thus,  a  1%  rise  in  government  expenditure  would  give  rise  to  a  0.35% \nincrease in GDP (see Appendix 4). \n\nWhile the announced \u201cheadline\u201d value of the stimulus is a total of RM70 billion (or 10% \nof  GDP)  and  is  expected  to  take  the  budget  deficit  from  4.8%  of  GDP  to  7.6%,  it  is \nunlikely that this will be the final amount spent. The major thrust of the package is to \nassist the private sector, particularly small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The RM25 \nbillion  set  aside  for  guaranteed  funds  includes  RM5  billion  for  a  working  capital \nguarantee  scheme  for  companies  with  equity  below  RM20  million;  RM5  billion  for  an \nindustry  restructuring  guarantee  fund  for  loans  to  encourage  green  technology \napplications; and RM15 billion to facilitate access to capital markets for companies that \nintend to raise funds on the bond market.  \n\nFunds  to  assist  SMEs  are  certainly  warranted,  as  SMEs  make  up  99%  of  total \nregistered  businesses  in  Malaysia.  These  contribute  56%  to  total  employment,  and \naccount for 32% of the GDP. In a survey of SME response to the stimulus (see New \nStraits  Times  2009),  respondents  stated  that  a  reduction  in  corporate  tax  and \nelectricity tariffs would be more effective in helping them deal with the crisis, and that \nthey  could  then  use  this  surplus  as  working  capital.  The  findings  also  indicated  that \nSMEs had yet to benefit or see any impact from the various assistance programs and \nstimulus packages offered by the government; they maintained that the effect of these \nchanges would more likely be felt in the long run. \n\nThe  package\u2019s  second  thrust  sets  aside  RM10  billion  to  allow  Khazanah,  the \ninvestment  arm  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance, to  increase  its funds  and  investment. The \nexistence  and  operation  of  this  fund  have  proven  contentious.  While  Khazanah  has \nmajor equity shares in the biggest Malaysian companies listed on the stock exchange, \nit is unclear how boosting its investments funds will provide an immediate stimulus to \nthe economy. \n\nThe  move  to  liberalize  the  services  sector,  involving  the  removal  of  the  30% \n\u201cbumiputera  equity  requirement\u201d  for  the  27  services  sub-sectors,  was  announced  at \nthe  same  time  as  the  second  stimulus  package.  The  sub-sectors  cover  health  and \nsocial services, as well  as services in the tourism, transport, business, and computer \nand its related sectors (Appendix 3). This liberalization is to take place with immediate \neffect, and in line with the ASEAN trade liberalization arrangements. It is expected to \nattract more investments, bring in more professionals and technology, and strengthen \nthe competitiveness of the sector.  \n\nIn the current context, services can provide a promising avenue for generating growth \nin the future. Baily, Farrell, and Remes (2005) suggest that given the right competitive \nenvironment,  services  can  be  a  powerful  source  of  wealth  creation  and  growth  in \nmiddle income countries. \n\nIt is highly unlikely that Malaysia  will be able to rely on its export-oriented strategy to \nthe same extent as before. Focus needs to shift to rebalancing growth and making it \nmore  domestically  driven.  The  reliance  on  an  undervalued  exchange  rate,  export \nincentives,  and  cheap  foreign  labor  to  ward  off  competition  from  other,  lower  wage \n\n13 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \neconomies is now losing its effectiveness. Unfortunately, Malaysia also lacks the skills \nnecessary to shift to higher value, manufactured products.  \n\nThe services sector contributed 55% to GDP in 2008, of which 47.6% came from non-\ngovernment  services  (Table  7).  The  sector  also  accounted  for  52.1%  of  the  total \nemployment  in  Malaysia  in  2008  (Table  8).  It  is  hoped  that  the  services  sector  will \nincrease its contribution to the GDP to 60%. \n\nTable 7: Malaysia\u2013Service Sector\u2019s Share of GDP by Subsector, 2008 \n\nSource: Ministry of Finance, Malaysia 2009 \n\nTable 8: Malaysia\u2013Service Sector\u2019s Share of Employment by Subsector, 2008  \n\n(%) \n\nSubsector  \n\nIntermediate Services  \nTransport and Storage \nCommunications  \nFinance and Insurance \nReal Estate and Business Services \nFinal Services \nUtilities (electricity water and gas) \nWholesale and Retail Trade \nAccommodation and Restaurants \nOther Services  \nGovernment Services  \nTOTAL \n\n(%) \n\nSubsector  \n\nElectricity, Gas and Water \nWholesale and Retail Trade,  \nAccommodation and Restaurants \nFinance, Insurance, Real Estate and \nBusiness \nTransport, Storage, and \nCommunication \nGovernment Services \nOther Services \nTOTAL \n\nShare of GDP  \n(%)  \n                  24.3 \n3.9 \n3.9 \n11.2 \n5.3 \n30.6 \n2.9 \n12.9 \n2.4 \n5.7 \n6.7 \n55.1 \n\nShare of GDP  \n (%)  \n\n0.8 \n17.1 \n\n7.0 \n\n5.8 \n\n10.9 \n10.4 \n52.1 \n\nSource: Ministry of Finance, Malaysia 2009 \n\nAlthough  these  liberalization  efforts  are  welcome,  their  impact  is  likely  to  be \nconstrained  by  the  fact  liberalization  across  sectors  have  been  very  uneven  (Khoo \n2009).  The  computer  and  related  services  sector,  for  example,  has  undergone \nconsiderable  liberalization  since  the  implementation  of  the  Mutlimedia  Supercorridor \n(MSC) project, which conferred MSC status on many companies and provided for an \nexemption from the  bumiputera  equity  criteria.  In  contrast,  health  and  social  services \nliberalization  has  failed  to  include  private  hospitals.  Even  transport  sub-sector \nliberalization is narrow, with the logistics sub-sector excluded. \n\nOne area which would have a pervasive impact is the lifting of the bumiputera equity \nconditions  for  firms  which  are  bidding  for  government-  and  government-linked \ncompanies  procurement  contracts.  Both  of  these  entities  combined  are  the  single \nbiggest consumers of services in Malaysia; given the size of government expenditure \nand activity, they are likely to have a large impact.  \n\n14 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \nThere has also been a bi-partisan call to liberalize nine sectors, i.e., property, utilities, \ngovernment investment agencies, airports, publication and printing of recorded media, \ntelecommunications,  public  transportation,  and  conventional  banking  and  financial \ninstitutions (Lee 2009). Proponents maintain that doing so will have a large impact on \nproductivity and production.  \n\nAdditionally,  there  is  concern  that  slow  implementation  of  the  stimulus  package  is \nimpeding its effectiveness. As of the end of September 2009, the disbursement rate for \nthe  first  package  announced  in  November  2008  was  61%,  while  that  for  second \npackage,  intended  to  be  disbursed  throughout  2009  and  2010,  was  only  26%  (World \nBank 2009a).  \n\nFiscal Space and Fiscal Sustainability \n\nWhile  there  is  no  fiscal  space  index  as  such  to  indicate  the  capacity  of  countries  to \nundertake fiscal packages, some of the macroeconomic indicators listed below can be \nused  to  make  a  preliminary  judgment.  Currently,  Malaysia  has  a  moderate  level  of \ndebt-to-  GDP  ratio,  a  comfortable  reserve  position,  a  large  account  surplus,  and  low \nlevels of short-term and foreign debt (Table 9). There appears to be the sufficient fiscal \nspace to implement a fiscal stimulus of the magnitude proposed. \n\nTable 9: Malaysia\u2013Selected Indicators of Fiscal Space, 2008 \n\nIndicator \n\nValue \n\nIncrease from 4.8 % to 7.6% \n45% \n\nDeficit/GDP \nDebt/GDP \n\nCurrent Account/GDP \n\nReserves/GDP \n\nReserves/Short-term debt \nReserves/Months of Imports \nFunding Sources \n\n17.5% \n\n50% \n\n3.9 \n7.7 \n93% domestic \n\nSource: Calculated from the IMF International Financial Statistics, 2009  \n\nHowever, looking beyond these indicators and examining the revenue and expenditure \nside of the budget raises a number of concerns. In 2008, 44% of government revenues \nwas  linked  to  petroleum  resources  transferred  from  the  state  oil  company  Petronas, \nwhich  is  fully  government-owned.  These  include  direct  taxes,  petroleum  royalties, \nexport taxes, and the item designated as interest and return on investment (Table 10). \nIn  fact,  dependence  on  oil  revenues  has  increased  sharply  since  2002,  when  oil \nrevenues  contributed  approximately  18%  of  the  total.  The  projected  deficit  for  2009 \nwas based on high oil prices last year. \n\n15 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \n\nTable 10: Malaysia\u2013Federal Government Revenues by Source, 2008 \n\n(%) \n\nRevenue Source \n\n% Share \n\nDirect Taxes \nCompanies \nPetroleum \nIndividuals \nStamp Duties \nOther \nIndirect Taxes \nExports Duties \nImport Duties \nExcise Duties \nSales Tax \nService Tax \nOthers \nNon-Tax Revenues \nLicenses and Permits \nPetroleum Royalty \nInterest and Return on Investment \nOthers \nNon-Revenue Receipts \nTOTAL \n\nSource: Ministry of Finance, Malaysia (2009) \n\nThe  price  of  Tapis  crude  has  since  fallen  from  US$125  per  barrel  to  US$  48.25  per \nbarrel in the first quarter of 2009. The budget has yet to be revised based on the more \nrecent  oil  price  projections.  In  2008,  the  non-oil  primary  balance  was  almost  12%  of \nGDP. It is anticipated that, at the current rate of oil consumption, Malaysia could be a \nnet oil importer as early as 2011. This has implications for Malaysia\u2019s current account \nand reserves positions as well as its deficit and debt. \n\nIn addition, approximately half of the oil windfalls have been spent on subsidies (Table \n11), which were threatening to consume more than half of expenditures until the basis \nfor  their  provision  was  revised.  Subsidies  to  both  businesses  and  consumers  have \nincreased consumption and depleted petroleum reserves. \n\nTable 11: Malaysia\u2013Federal Government Expenditure by Functional \nClassification, 2008  \n\n(%) \n\n% Share \n\nExpenditure Item \n\nEmoluments \nPensions and Gratuities \nDebt Service \n  Domestic  \n  Foreign \nSupplies and Services \nSubsidies \nAsset Acquisition \nGrants and Transfers \nOther \nTOTAL \n\n16 \n\nSource: Ministry of Finance, Malaysia  \n\n \n\n53.7 \n23.8 \n15.2 \n9.4 \n2.2 \n1.1 \n  \n1.8 \n1.7 \n6.7 \n5.3 \n2.1 \n1.9 \n29.5  \n3.3 \n3.7 \n20.3 \n1.6 \n0.6 \n100 \n\n26.7 \n6.5 \n8.3 \n7.6 \n0.8 \n16.4 \n19.5 \n1.8 \n20.1 \n0.6 \n100 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \nIn  terms  of  financing  the  deficit  and  debt,  the  \u201ccircular  flow\u201d  can  be  summarized  as \nfollows: in 2008 Petronas funds contributes about 44% of revenues; in turn, the deficit \nis financed domestically, primarily by the Employees Provident Fund but also by other \ngovernment owned funds and banks.  \n\nIn the current stimulus package, Khazanah is allocated RM10 billion to  boost equity in \nstrategic  sectors.  These  are  telecommunications,  technology,  tourism,  agriculture  life \nsciences,  and  projects  related  to  Iskandar  Malaysia. 1\n  Channeling  stimulus  funds \nthrough  Khazanah  has  left  the  government  open  to  claims  that  this  money  will  be \ninjected  into  companies  which  are  already  majority  government-owned,  or  closely \nconnected  to the government.  In this  context, tax  breaks  across  the  board may  have \nprovided a greater stimulus to the private sector and may have been regarded as more \nimpartial. \n\nCurrent  attention  needs  to  be  focused  on  a  deficit  reduction  strategy  given  the \nprojected  increase  in  debt-to-GDP  ratio.  At  the  end  of  2008,  the  debt  was \napproximately  45%  of  GDP.  However,  given  the  forecast  growth  rate  of  -3.5%  for \n2009,  and  the  current  interest  rate  on  debt  of  4.2  %,  debt  at  the  end  of  2009  will \nincrease  sharply  to  approximately  54.5%.  This  sharp  increase  is  a  reflection  of  the \nlarge  differential  between  growth  rates  and  interest  rates,  as  well  as  a  negative \nprimary balance.  \n\nMalaysia\u2019s  debt-to-GDP  ratio  was  54.5%  in  2009;  assuming  an  annual  GDP  growth \nrate  of  3%  from  2010  to  2013,  this  ratio  is  projected  to  increase  to  76%  of  GDP  by \n2013. With a GDP growth rate of 5%, the ratio is projected to be slightly lower at 73% \nof GDP (Figure 1).  \n\nFigure 1: Malaysia\u2014Debt/GDP Projection, 2008\u20132013 \n\n \n\nGDP= gross domestic product \n\nSource(s):  Author\u2019s Estimations \n\nThe  IMF  projects  the  budget  deficit  for  2009  to  be  around  8%  of  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP). The non-oil deficit is projected to reach 15% of GDP in 2010. Should \nthe debt to GDP ratio reach 77% of GDP, Malaysia will need to run a primary balance \nsurplus of 4% of GDP over the next ten years to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to the \ncurrent  level  of  45%.  Given  its  fiscal  performance  to  date,  this  will  be  an  enormous \nchallenge. \n\n \n\n                                                \n1 Iskandar  Malaysia  is  modeled  after  the  Pearl  River  Delta  Economic  Zone.  It  is \nenvisaged that it will capitalize on synergies with Singapore. \n\n17 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \nHeavy  reliance  on  Petronas  for  revenues  is  not  a  viable  long  term  strategy.  The \nestablishment  of  a  petroleum  fund  needs  to  be  seriously  considered.  This  will  confer \nmany  benefits,  including  reduced  exposure  to  volatile  oil  prices,  procyclicality  in \nspending, \nintergenerational  equity \nconsiderations.  \n\ntransparency,  and  sensitivity \n\nincreased \n\nto \n\nThe high level of subsidies also needs to be reconsidered. The introduction of a value \nadded  tax  (VAT)  has  long  been  discussed,  and  its  implementation  in  2011  should \nproceed  as  scheduled.  Over  the  medium  term,  consideration  should  be  given  to  the \nredirection  of  subsidies,  which  consumed  20%  of  the  budget  in  2008  to  provide  a \nsocial safety net for the poor. Given the low official poverty rate of 6%, this may be a \nfeasible strategy. It would also help to boost the very low levels of consumption. \n\nThe  role  of  Khazanah  and  government-linked  companies  should  also  be  reviewed, \ngiven their impact on their economy. The consolidation of accounts to include all non-\nfinancial  public  sector  enterprises  and  the  recording  of  quasi-fiscal  and  off-budget \noperations  need  to  improved,  to  provide  a  more  accurate  gauge  of  the  assets  and \nliabilities of the public sector. \n\n3.2 \n\nIndonesia  \n\n3.2.1  A Brief Historical Overview of Fiscal Performance in Indonesia \n\nUp  until  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  Indonesia  followed  the  balanced  budget  rule, \nwhereby routine expenditures were covered by government tax and non-tax revenue. \nThe  development  budget  was  covered  partly  by  foreign  loans,  almost  all  of  which \ncame  from  official  development  assistance.  Government  debt  prior  to  the  crisis  was \nalmost entirely foreign, amounting to 22.9% of GDP in 1996. \n\nIn  the  aftermath  of  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  both  foreign  and  domestic  debt  rose \nalarmingly,  reaching  over  100%  of  GDP  in  2000  (Table  12).  This  was  due  to  the \nmassive  depreciation  of  the  rupiah.  Previously  non-existent  domestic  debt  rose  from \nthe  costs  accruing  to  the  budget  due  to  the  government\u2019s  blanket  deposit  guarantee \nscheme  and  the  issuance  of  recapitalization  bonds  to  rescue  the  failing  banking  and \ncorporate sectors. This amounted to about Rp740 trillion in 1998\u20131999 (roughly one-\nhalf of GDP in 1999), one of the costliest bank bailouts in history. \n\n \n\n18 \n\n\fTotal Domestic \nand Foreign \nDebt (Rp trillion) \n   External  \n   Domestic \nTotal Debt \nService as a \npercentage of \nrevenues \nTotal Debt \nService as a \npercentage of \nexpenditure  \nTotal Debt \nService as a \npercentage of \nGDP \nPrimary Fiscal \nBalance \nFiscal \nSurplus/Deficit  \nDebt/GDP (%) \n \n\nADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \n\nTable 12: Indonesia\u2013Government Debt Service Payment in Government Budget, \n1999\u20132002 \n\nYear \n\n1997/98 \n\n1998/99 \n\n1999/00 \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n29.5 \n\n62.9 \n\n63.1 \n\n57.7 \n\n115.3 \n\n136.2 \n\n29.5 \n0.0 \n26.3 \n\n54.5 \n8.4 \n42.8 \n\n40.9 \n22.2 \n30.9 \n\n26.5 \n31.2 \n28.1 \n\n49.0 \n66.3 \n38.4 \n\n72.9 \n63.4 \n45.2 \n\n26.4 \n\n37.4 \n\n27.3 \n\n26.6 \n\n32.5 \n\n39.6 \n\n4.3 \n\n6.0 \n\n5.6 \n\n5.8 \n\n7.8 \n\n8.1 \n\n2.5 \n\n0.1 \n\n23 \n\n1.1 \n\n-2.0 \n\n73.7 \n\n1.4 \n\n-2.3 \n\n3.9 \n\n-1.2 \n\n2.8 \n\n-3.7 \n\n94.8 \n\n100.3 \n\n89.8 \n\n2.7 \n\n-2.5 \n\n80 \n\nSource(s):  IMF, International Financial Statistics, various issues \n\nHill  (2006)  asserts  that  Indonesia  managed  to  bring  the  fiscal  deficit  and  debt  under \ncontrol  in  spite  of  a  weakened  central  government,  an  ambitious  decentralization \nprogram, increased pressure to set up social expenditure, and widespread discontent \nwith  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  stabilization  program.  What  made  this \npossible  were  very  modest  fiscal  deficits,  stronger  economic  growth,  lower  interest \nrates,  an  appreciation  in  the  rupiah,  a  renegotiation  of  debt  maturity  and\u2014in  the \naftermath of the tsunami\u2014debt forgiveness. A Fiscal Law (Law No. 17) was introduced \nin  2003,  capping  the  budget  deficit  at  3%  of  GDP  and  public  debt  at  60%  of  GDP \n(OECD  2008).  The  current  budget  deficit  is  around  33%  of  GDP\u2014this  represents  a \nreduction in debt/GDP ratio of almost 70% since 2000. \n\n3.2.2  Fiscal Stimulus Packages: Size and Composition of Stimulus, Fiscal \n\nSpace, and Fiscal Sustainability \n\nSize and Composition of Stimulus \n\nOverall, Indonesia is expected to be one of the better performers in the region, with a \nforecast growth rate of approximately 4% for 2009. The output gap as a percentage of \nGDP  was  in  the  region  of  plus  or  minus  two  percent  of  GDP  prior  to  the  2008\u201309 \nglobal  financial  crisis  (Appendix  6).  Estimates  of  the  multiplier  based  on  SVAR  show \nsignificant results only for the third lagged coefficients. These, however, are negative. \n\nPrivate  consumption,  which  accounts  for  about  61%  of  GDP  (Table  13),  was  strong \nparticularly  in  the  first  quarter  of  2009.  Fuelled  by  high  levels  of  spending  on \nparliamentary elections and strong harvests, it recorded an increase of 6% in the first \nquarter of 2009.  \n\nGovernment consumption likewise recorded a 19.2% growth rate in the first quarter of \n2009. However, this was mostly due to higher public service salaries announced in the \n2008 budget. \n\n19 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \n \n\nAnother  main  driver  of  growth  in  2009  was  net  exports,  due  to  a  sharper  decline  in \nimports  of approximately  26%  compared to  exports  of  about  19%.

Subsidies  made  up  another  25%;  infrastructure,  11%;  and  equity \ninjections, 2%.  \n\nThe Indonesian fiscal stimulus package faces challenges relating to the low number of \nindividual  and  corporate  taxpayers,  the  lack  of  targeted  subsidies,  and  budget \nexecution problems both in general and particularly in relation to infrastructure. \n\nWith its current population of approximately 225 million, and a workforce estimated at \n97 million, 60 million people are estimated to be informally employed.

Furthermore,  it  is \nestimated that one percent of taxpayers pay about 56% of taxes. As such, lowering the \npersonal  income  tax  and  directing  more  than  a  third  of  the  stimulus  to  lifting  the \nincome tax threshold only benefit a small proportion of the total population, mainly the \nrelatively  better  off.  The  estimated  half  of  the  Indonesian  population  living  below  the \npoverty line and the 40% of the population employed in the agricultural sector do not \npay  taxes.  The  distribution  is  not  particularly  pro-poor,  and  direct  cash  transfers  to \ntargeted poor households may have been more equitable. \n\nA  similar  situation  is  encountered  as  far  as  corporate  taxes  are  concerned.  This  is \npartly due to the fact that almost 98% of the Indonesian corporate sector is dominated \nby  micro  and  small  enterprises,  which  are  legal  entities  and  are  therefore  not \nregistered for tax purposes. Ikhsan, Trialdi, and Syahrial (2005) estimate that in 2002, \nonly  200,000  corporations  were  registered  for  tax  purposes,  out  of  about  48  million \nbusinesses  in  Indonesia.  Virtually  all  tax  due  is  paid  by  the  highest  bracket.  In  this \ncontext  a  reduction  in  corporate  taxes  is  likely  to  benefit  the  largest  businesses \nentities. \n\nThe  high  level  of  informality  in  employment  and  enterprise  in  Indonesia  impedes  the \neffectiveness  of  the  fiscal  stimulus  and  the  automatic  stabilizing  impulses  of  the \nbudget.  Yadav  (2009)  asserts  that  the  informal  sector  was  originally  treated  as  a \nresidual  emanating  from  the  insufficient  absorptive  capacity  of  the  formal  economy, \nand  that  productivity  growth  in  the  formal  sector  acts  as  a  \u201cpull\u201d  factor,  drawing  in \ninformal sector workers and enterprises as development occurs. However, the informal \nsector  has  increased  over  time,  particularly  in  the  wake  of  the  Asian  financial  crisis \n(OECD 2008). \n\n24 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \nA  more  recent  view  (McKinsey  Global  Institute  2006)  considers  informal  firms  as  a \nthreat to formal firms and an obstacle to growth, for two reasons. First, informal firms \ntend  to  remain  small  so  as  to  remain  under  the  radar  and  avoid  detection  by \nauthorities.  This  gives  rise  to  a  \u201clow-productivity  trap\u201d  which  adversely  impacts  the \noverall  productivity  growth  of  a  country.  It  has  been  estimated  that  informal  firms \noperate  about  50%  below  the  average  productivity  level  of  formal  firms  within  the \nsame sector. Second, the cost advantage enjoyed by informal firms due to tax evasion \nand regulatory non-compliance gives them an edge over formal firms, thereby allowing \nthem  to  impinge  on  the  formal  sector\u2019s  market  share.  Formal  firms  are  subjected  to \nunfair  competition  which  reduces  their  incentive  to  invest,  expand,  and  improve \nproductivity.  In  addition, low  tax  revenue  as  a  result  of the  large  informal  sector  may \ninduce  more  stringent  taxation  of  the  formal  sector,  which  may  then  further  fuel \ninformality.  \n\nFarrell  (2004)  argues  that  informal  businesses,  even  large  ones,  choose  to  stay  that \nway if there is no change in the factors that generally drive them into informality: high \ncorporate taxes and the bureaucratic burden of operating formally. The OECD (2008) \nnotes  that,  in  Indonesia\u2019s  case,  two  important  contributors  to  informality  are  the \ntightening of employment protection legislation (EPL), especially with the enactment of \nthe  Manpower  Law  of  2003,  and  sharp  increases  in  the  real  value  of  the  minimum \nwage, which is currently about 65% of the median wage. \n\nAccording  to  the  OECD  (2008),  the  EPL\u2019s  provisions  on  dismissal  procedures, \nseverance compensation entitlements, restrictions on flexible work arrangements, and \nminimum-wage setting have been the least conducive to improvements in labor market \noutcomes. This  is  affirmed  in  the World  Bank\u2019s  (2009b)  Doing  Business  in  Indonesia \nSurvey, where Indonesia ranks 150 out of a total of 183 countries in terms of difficulty \nassociated  with  hiring  labor.  Indonesia  also  ranks  poorly  in  terms  of  opening  and \nclosing  a  business  and enforcing  contracts. These  concerns  need to  be addressed  if \nlabor market informality is to be reduced. \n\nWith  regard  to  subsidies,  these  currently  consume  more  than  10%  of  government \nexpenditure in 2008 (Table 19), with the bulk directed to fuel. Most of these subsidies \nare  poorly  targeted,  with  fuel  subsidies  benefiting  the  richest  20%  of  households \n(Augustina et al. 2008). \n\n25 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \n \n\nTable 19: Indonesia\u2013Government Expenditures as a Percentage of GDP, 2008 \n\nExpenditure Item \n\n% Share \n \n\nCentral Government  Expenditure \nPersonnel Expenditure \nMaterial Expenditure \nInterest Payments \nSubsidy \nSocial Assistance \nOthers \nCapital Expenditure \nTransfers to Regions \nSpecial Autonomy and Adjustment Fund \nTotal Central Government and Transfers \n\nNote: GDP = gross domestic product \n\nSource: Department of Finance Indonesia, 2009   \n\n14.3 \n2.9 \n2.0 \n2.4 \n2.9 \n1.5 \n0.5 \n2.1 \n7.1 \n0.2 \n21.6 \n\nAs for infrastructure projects, infrastructure investment in Indonesia currently amounts \nto  approximately  3.4%  of  GDP.  Given  the  deterioration  in  many  infrastructure \nindicators  over  the  past  decade,  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  upgrade  and  expand \nexisting  infrastructure.  However,  the  implementation  of  infrastructure  projects  in \nIndonesia has traditionally been hampered by poor budget execution.  \n\nAccording  to  the  World  Bank  (2007),  actual  budget  performance  in  Indonesia  has \nroutinely deviated from budget realization indicators. There is an overall problem with \nspending, and while budgets have become larger, the government has been unable to \nspend \ntransfers  are  substantially \nunderestimated, while realized capital/development expenditures are often lower than \ninitially planned. In addition, Indonesia frequently spends 50% of its capital budget in \nthe final quarter of the year. Project implementation is disrupted by an adverse cycle, \nand in the case of multi-year projects, it is interrupted at the beginning of each year. \n\nthe  money  appropriated.  Subsidies  and \n\nThis  problem  has  worsened  since  Indonesia  pursued  decentralization  in  2001. \nIndonesia  currently  has  one  of  the  most  decentralized  governments  in  the  world. \nProvincial  and  district  governments  now  manage  more  than  30%  of  total  public \nexpenditure (Table 18) and carry out more than 50% of public investment. The World \nBank  (2007)  notes  that  Indonesia\u2019s  main  development  challenge  is  no  longer  to \ntransfer money to poorer regions, but to ensure that poorer regions spend their money \nwell.  The  largest  item  of  spending  of  sub-national  governments  is  government \nadministration,  which  absorbs  32%  of  national  expenditures.  This  has  crowded  out \nspending in key areas, particularly health, infrastructure, and agriculture.  \n\nFurthermore,  many  local  governments  have  difficulty  spending  their  additional \nresources.  Sub-national  governments  now  have  an  accumulated  level  of  reserves \nreaching  3%  of  GDP  in  2007.  Overall,  the  World  Bank  (2007)  concludes  that  public \nfinancial  management  systems  are  weak  and  risks  of  corruption  are  high.  Local \ngovernment  performance  in  the  areas  of  debt  investment  and  external  audit,  and \ncapacity and human resources have also been found to be extremely weak.  \n\nFiscal Space and Fiscal Sustainability \n\n \n\nIndonesia achieved a growth rate of 5.8% in 2008 and a respectable growth rate of 4% \nis forecast for 2009. The forecast deficit is expected to increase by just 0.9% of GDP in \n2009  as  a  result  of  the  stimulus.  Currently,  Indonesia  has  a  moderate  debt-to-GDP \nratio,  of  which  55.8%  is  domestic  debt  (Table  20).  Rupiah-denominated  government \nsecurities  are  the  major  source  of  debt  financing  in  Indonesia.

The  remainder  will  be  raised  through \nthe issue of negotiable and non-negotiable government securities in rupiah and foreign \ncurrencies, sold to domestic and foreign investors.  \n\nThe Indonesian government has held intensive talks with both multilateral and bilateral \ncreditors to provide backup in the form of standby loans, in the event of weak investor \ndemand, as well as greater competition for available funds as other countries embark \non  expansionary  fiscal  policies  of  their  own.  Commitments  have  been  secured  from \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank,  the  World  Bank,  Australia,  and  Japan  via  the  Japan \nBank for International Corporation. \n\nOn the upside, an improvement in Indonesia\u2019s tax collection systems has strengthened \nIndonesia\u2019s  finances.  This  is  thought  to  be  primarily  due  to  the  tax  office\u2019s  efforts  to \ntarget  taxpayers  in  the  highly  profitable  commodity  sectors  and  improve  its  internal \npersonnel  management  (World  Bank  2007).  Given  Indonesia\u2019s  historical  difficulties \nwith  budget  execution,  slippages  as  far  as  widening  deficits  and  increasing  debt  are \nnot  likely  to  cause  problems.  In  fact,  by  July  2009,  the  government  had  only  spent \n10.9% of the funds allocated to the expenditure on the budget and the fiscal stimulus \npackage \n\nGiven the IMF\u2019s annual average GDP growth forecast of 5% in the next five years, the \nprojected  debt-to-GDP  ratio  is  expected  to  decline  slightly,  to  approximately  27%  of \nGDP. Risks surrounding fiscal sustainability are therefore low. \n\n27 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \n\nFigure 2: Indonesia\u2014Debt/GDP Projection, 2008\u20132013 \n\nDebt/GDP Projection Indonesia\n\nP\nD\nG\n\n/\nt\nb\ne\nD\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n5%growth\n\n \n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\nYear\n\nNote: GDP = gross domestic product \n\nSource(s):  Author\u2019s Estimation \n\n3.3  The Philippines  \n\n3.3.1  A Brief Historical Overview of Fiscal Performance in the Philippines  \n\nFiscal  sustainability  issues  are  longstanding  in  the  Philippines.  A  budget  deficit  has \nbeen  recorded  every  year  since  the  1970s,  with  the  exception  of  small  surpluses  of \nless  than  1%  between  1994  and  1997.  This  was  achieved  through  privatization \nreceipts and efforts to consolidate spending. After the Asian financial crisis, however, \nthe consolidated budget deficit rose from 1% of GDP in 1997 and peaked at 5.8 % of \nGDP  in  2003,  while  the  stock  of  public  debt  and  contingent  liabilities  reached  the \nequivalent  of  137%  of GDP.  In  addition,  30%  of total government  revenue  had  to  be \nset  aside  for  interest  payments,  squeezing  out  spending  on  essential  government \nservices  and  prompting ratings  downgrades  and fears  about macroeconomic  stability \n(Qin et al. 2006).  \n\nThe  country\u2019s  high  level  of  debt  can  be  traced  back to  poor  economic governance  in \nthe 1970s under the Marcos regime. According to Dohner and Intal (1989), the use of \ngovernment  power  to  gather  and  distribute  wealth  worked  in  three  ways  during  the \nMarcos  era.  First,  the  allocation  of  government  contracts  and  access  to  credit  from \npublic financial institutions were provided in return for some interest or \u201ckickbacks\u201d in \noperations.  Second,  projects  and  contracts  were  also  overpriced  to  generate \n\u201ckickbacks\u201d.  The  most  publicized  of  these  was  the  Bataan  nuclear  power  contract, \nestimated to be responsible for 10% of the foreign debt. Finally, access to credit was \nprovided to cronies at below market rates and through \u201cbehest\u201d loans.  \n\nA  debt  moratorium  was  declared  in  1983,  and  the  Philippines  emerged  from  martial \nlaw in 1986 with an external debt close to 100% of GDP. After the Marcos regime fell \nin  1986,  the  Aquino  government  nationalized  the  external  debt  inherited  from  the \nMarcos  regime.  This  dramatically  increased  debt  service  and  domestic  borrowing \nrequirements.  Significant  increases  in  public  infrastructure  further  led  to  higher  fiscal \ndeficits. Although the Aquino government formulated tax reform measures, the central \nfeature of which was the implementation of a value added tax in 1988, these changes \ndid not lead to an appreciable rise in the tax revenue as a proportion of GDP.  \n\n \n\n28 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \nAfter the Asian financial crisis, deficits were initially driven by the national government. \nWhile  national  government  expenditures  remained  stable  at  around  19.4%  of  GDP \nfrom 1997\u20132003, the tax revenue effort declined steadily from 17.0% of GDP to 12.7% \nin  2003.  This  decline  was  caused  by  a  chronic  inability  to  collect  sufficient  revenues \ndue  to  the  weak  institutional  capacity  of  tax  authorities,  complicated  and  irrational \ntaxation systems, and corruption in revenue collections causing tax evasion (Manasan \n2004).  From  2000\u20132004,  however,  Government  Owned  and  Controlled  Corporations \n(GOCCs)  became  the  primary  culprit  behind  the  deficit,  with  the  National  Power \nCorporation (NAPOCOR) being a major driver of the non-financial consolidated public \nsector deficit and debt.  \n\nIn  2004,  the  government  adopted  an  aggressive  and  bold  agenda  to  bring  down  the \nfiscal deficit over the medium term. The plan centered on achieving a balanced budget \nby 2010 through a range of measures. These included new tax measures; privatization \nand  restructuring  of  GOCCs,  especially  the  power  sector;  improvements  in  tax \nadministration,  rationalization  of  the  bureaucracy;  and  improvements  in  public  debt \nand expenditure management.  \n\nThe centerpiece of the new tax measures were amendments to expand the coverage \nof the VAT (E-VAT). In 2008, the debt-to-GDP ratio was brought down to 56% of GDP, \na  reduction  of  more  than  20%  from  its  peak  in  2004.  Interest  payments  on  the  debt \nhad also declined to 21% of government expenditure.  \n\n3.3.2  Fiscal Stimulus Packages: Size and Composition of Stimulus, Fiscal \n\nSpace and Fiscal Sustainability \n\nSize and Composition of Stimulus \n\nIn 2007, the Philippines recorded a growth rate of 7.8%, its highest level of growth in \nalmost 25 years. However, growth slowed to 4.6% in 2008 and is forecast to be about \none percent in 2009. \n\nThe  output  gap  as  a  percentage  of  GDP  was  in  the  region  of  plus  or  minus  one \npercent  of  GDP  prior  to  the  crisis  (Appendix  7).  Estimates  of  the  multiplier  based  on \nSVAR  show  insignificant  results  for  all  four  lagged  coefficients  of  the  impact  of \ngovernment (Appendix 7). \n\nGrowth  was  0.4%  in  the  first  quarter  of  2009.  Exports  declined  by  18%  in  the  first \nquarter  of  2009,  with  imports  decreasing  by  about  the  same  proportion.  Investment \ndeclined  by  16%.  Personal  consumption  expenditure  grew  by  less  than  one  percent \nwhile government consumption was 3.78%.  \n\nCompared  to  other  countries  in  the  region,  the  Philippines  have  a  high  level  of \npersonal  consumption,  driven  to  some  extent  by  remittances  from  Overseas  Filipino \nWorkers (OFWs). Remittances have been resilient in the face of crisis and remain at \nabout 10% of GDP (Table 22). \n\nTable 22: Philippines\u2013Gross National Product by Expenditure Shares, 2008  \n\nComponent \n\n% Share \n\nPersonal Consumption  \nGovt.

The  ERP \nled government to postpone its medium-term balanced budget goal to 2011. \n\nThe package consists of the following: \n\n\u2022  P160  billion  for  increased  national  government  (NG)  spending  on  community \n\nlevel infrastructure projects and social protection measures;  \n\n\u2022  P100  billion  to  finance  extra-budgetary  infrastructure  projects  and  fund  large \ninfrastructure projects. This would require GOCCs, the Social Security System \n(SSS),  and  the  Government  Service  Insurance  System  (GSIS)  to  undertake \nlarge infrastructure projects using their investment funds in conjunction with the \nprivate sector; \n\n\u2022  P30  billion  for  new  and  temporary  additional  benefits  to  SSS,  GSIS  and \n\nPhilHealth, members. \n\n\u2022  P40 billion in income tax cuts. including P20 billion stemming from a reduction \nof  corporate  income  tax  from  35  to  30%,  and  an  increase  in  personal  tax \nexemptions,  estimated  at  another  P20  billion.  The  cuts  are  anticipated  to \nincrease investment and consumption by P40 billion. Other measures include a \nP250  million  fund  for  OFWs  known  as  the  \u201cpayback\u201d  package,  designed  to \nassist  OFWs  abroad  and  provide  those  returning  with  reintegration  and \nlivelihood assistance. \n\nPadilla  (2009)  however,  maintains  that  out  of  the  P160  billion  increase  in  spending, \nonly P50 billion can be considered new funds. This represents the sum realigned from \nservicing debt interest payments in the national budget for 2009. The remaining P110 \nbillion was already a planned increase before the crisis. \n\nMeanwhile,  the  second  item\u2014the  P100  billion  allocated  for  infrastructure  projects,  a \nportion  of  which  would  be  bankrolled  by  government  financial  institutions  and  social \nsecurity\u2014could face uncertainties as a portion of the funds is supposed to come from \nprivate investors. This has also been postponed to 2010. \n\nThe P40 billion tax cuts under the ERP are not new, and are thought to represent the \nestimated  additional  savings  for  low  and  middle  income  earners  and  corporations \naccruing from the RVAT.  \n\nFinally,  the  P30  billion  in  additional  benefits  to  members  of  social  security  and \ninstitutions  like  the  SSS  and  the  GSIS  are  also  uncertain,  since  these  depend  on \ninstitutional investments which took a hit when stock markets fell. \n\nConsequently,  the  amount  that  will  actually  be  spent  cannot  be  stated  with  certainty. \nThe World Bank (2009c) notes that the ERP finely balances the need for fiscal easing. \nOn  the  one  hand,  it  calls  for  (i)  protecting  its  poorest  and  most  at  risk  citizens,  (ii) \nboosting  the  medium-term  prospects  of  the  economy  (e.g.,  by  relieving  infrastructure \nbottlenecks),  and  (iii)  closing  the  output  gap  created  by  the  private  sector.    On  the \nother  hand,  it  recognizes  the  limited  fiscal  space  available.  The  latter  is  mostly  the \nresult  of  the  country\u2019s  high  level  of  debt,  which  is  easily  affected  by  shocks  to  GDP \ngrowth and the exchange rate. \n\nFiscal Space and Fiscal Sustainability \n\n \n\nOverall, the ERP is projected to increase the deficit as a percentage of GDP to 2.3% in \n2009. \n\nIn 2009 debt as a percentage of GDP was about 60%, which, while still high, was far \nbelow the peak reached four years earlier, at 78% (Table 23).  \n\n30 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \n\nTable 23: Philippines\u2013Selected Indicators of Fiscal Sustainability, 2008  \n\nIndicator \n\nDeficit/GDP \nDebt/GDP \nCurrent Account/GDP \nReserves/GDP  \nReserves to short-term debt \nReserves to months of imports \nFunding  \nNote: GDP = gross domestic product \n\nValue \nTo rise from -0.9% to -2.3%  \n60% as of March 2009 \n2.4% \n23% \n4.76 \n5.9 months \n57% domestic \n\nSource: Computed from the IMF International Financial Statistics, various issues \n\nHowever,  the  downside  to  this  is  that  despite  enhanced  revenue  measures,  the \nimproved fiscal  outcome  was  derived  mainly from  expenditure  cuts.

Currently, tax collection \nis  weakening  due  to  the  slowing  economy,  falling  customs  revenues,  and  recent  tax \npolicy  and  administrative  measures  such  as  the effective  tax  cut  on  personal  income \n(World Bank 2009c). On the other hand, spending has surged and the deficit stands at \n4.1%  of  GDP  as  of  October  2009.

Findings  point  to  a  relatively  stable  but  still  high \nlevel of debt to-GDP of 53% and 51% by 2013, assuming annual GDP growth rates of \n3% and 5% respectively. \n\n32 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \n\nFigure 3: Philippines\u2014Debt/GDP Projection, 2008\u20132013 \n\nDebt/GDP Projection Philippines\n\nP\nD\nG\n\n/\nt\nb\ne\nD\n\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n\n3%growth\n\n5 % growth\n\n \n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\nYear\n\nGDP=Gross Domestic Product  \n\nSource(s):  Author\u2019s estimation \n\nIn  summary,  the  Philippine  economy  is  not  expected  to  contract  as  sharply  as  other \nmore  export-oriented  economies  such  as  Malaysia  or  Singapore.  GDP  growth  has \nslowed to about one percent over the first three quarters of 2009. While spending from \nthe  stimulus\u2014which  increased  by  18.1%  in  the  first  half  of  2009\u2014provided  some \nimpetus  to  growth,  the  reduction  in  revenues  by  4%  and  the  blowout  in  the  deficit  to \n4.1% limits the further role of fiscal policy in view of the persistently high level of debt \nand interest expenditure in the budget. \n\n3.4  Singapore  \n\n3.4.1  A Brief Historical Overview of Fiscal Performance in Singapore  \n\nAccording  to  the  Singapore  Ministry  of  Finance  (2009),  fiscal  policy  in  Singapore  is \ndirected  primarily  at  promoting  long-term  economic  growth,  rather  than  cyclical \nadjustment or income distribution. Income and company taxes are kept low to attract \nforeign  investment  and  foreign  talent.  Singapore\u2019s  fiscal  conservatism  has  been \nreflected in high structural surpluses, and the overall fiscal balance of the government \nhas  been  in  surplus\u2014as  defined  by  the  IMF  methodology\u2014since  1988  (Jang  and \nNakabayashi 2005). \n\nIt is useful to think of the Singapore public finance system as consisting of four pillars: \nthe budget sector itself, the Central Provident Fund (CPF), the government investment \nagencies, and other funds (Blondal 2006). \n\nThe CPF is a mandatory savings scheme financed by payroll contributions from both \nemployees and employers. The combined contribution is currently 33%, with 20% paid \nby  the  employee  and  14.5%  paid  by  the  employer.  Withdrawal  of  funds  to  pay  for \nhousing and medical purposes is permitted. The CPF obviates the need of the budget \nsector  to  finance  social  services.  The  CPF  also  generates  large  amounts  of  surplus \ncash flows which are invested in government securities. This explains why Singapore \nhas  high  levels  of  domestic  debt,  despite  continuous  budget  surpluses  and  the \nabsence of debt financing requirements. \n\nThe government has two principal investment agencies: the Government of Singapore \nInvestment Corporation (GIC) and Temasek Holdings, both of which are answerable to \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance.  The  GIC  acts  as  a  fund  manager  for  the  government  and \nfocuses  on  overseas  investment  of  the  country\u2019s  surpluses  in  equities,  fixed  income, \n\n33 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \nmoney  market  instruments,  real  estate,  and  special  instruments.  Temasek  manages \ncorporate shareholdings both in Singapore and abroad. Its corporate profile includes a \nwide  range  of  sectors,  and  several  of  the  companies  are  listed  on  stock  markets  in \nSingapore and overseas. \n\nThere  are  several  other  funds  which  are  not  consolidated  in  the  budget  but  are \ngoverned by specific acts. These include the Government Securities Fund, where the \nCPF  invests  its  surplus  funds.  The  interest  paid  to  the  CPF  is  netted  against \ninvestment income earned by the government agencies; thus the budget sector does \nnot show any interest expenses paid.  \n\nthree  key \n\nfiscal  rules  governing \n\nThe  Singapore  constitution  contains \nfiscal \nresponsibility  and  sustainability  in  the  country.  First, the government  should  not  draw \nupon resources accumulated during previous terms of office. This means that deficits \nin any year must be balanced by surpluses accumulated in earlier years during its term \nin  office.  Second,  the  government  may  only  consider  as  revenue  for  these  purposes \nup to half of the annual net investment income from the accumulated reserves. Third, \nthe government may engage in deficit financing and draw on past reserves if consent \nis given by both the Parliament and the President. This is known in Singapore as the \n\u201ctwo-key\u201d safety mechanism.  \n\nUnlike  other  countries  in  this  study,  and  indeed  the  developing  world  in  general, \nSingapore  has  no  external  debt  or  expenditure  on  subsidies  and  interest  payments. \nFurthermore, unlike a lot of OECD countries, its spending on social security is minimal, \ndespite being a high income country with a rapidly aging society. Individual savings for \nold age is seen as the responsibility of the individual through compulsory savings with \nthe CPF. The family is also expected to play its part. The Maintenance of Parents Act \npassed in 1995 allows for parents over the age of 60 to apply to a tribunal for an order \nfor  their  offspring  to  provide  support.  Support  from  the  community,  mainly  through \ncharities, is seen as a last resort. \n\n3.4.2  Fiscal Stimulus Packages: Size and Composition of Stimulus, Fiscal \n\nSpace and Fiscal Sustainability \n\nSize and Composition of Stimulus \n\nSingapore\u2019s economy was one of the first to contract sharply at the end of 2008, with \nGDP falling by 4.2% in the fourth quarter. The output gap as a percentage of GDP was \nin  the region  of  plus  or minus  one  percent  of GDP  prior to  the  crisis (Appendix  8).  A \nnegative growth rate of between 5 and 7% of GDP has been forecast for 2009, leaving \na large output gap of at more than 10% of GDP. Estimates of the multiplier based on \nSVAR  show  insignificant  results  for  all  four  lagged  coefficients  of  the  impact  of \ngovernment expenditure on output.  \n\nSingapore\u2019s  GDP  experienced  the  sharpest  contraction  in  the  first  quarter  of  2009, \nfalling  by  9.5%.  Exports  fell  by  21%,  and  imports  by  19.2%.  Gross  fixed  capital \nformation also contracted sharply by 15.5%. GDP growth fell in the second quarter by \n3.3%, bringing the contraction in the first half of 2009 to 6.4% (Table 26). \n\n34 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \n\nTable 26: Singapore\u2013Quarterly Change in GDP by Expenditure, \n\nQ42008 to Q32009  \n\n(%) \n\nComponent \n\nQ42008 \n\nQ12009 \n\nQ22009 \n\nQ32009 \n\nPrivate Consumption \n\nGovernment Consumption \n\nGross Fixed Capital Formation \n\nExports of Goods and Services \n\nImports of Goods and Services \n\nTotal \n\nGDP = gross domestic product \n\nSource: Singstat, year 2009 \n\n-1.2 \n\n2.7 \n\n-9.9 \n\n-9.6 \n\n-5.8 \n\n-4.2 \n\n-4.2 \n\n-6.7 \n\n-15.5 \n\n-21.1 \n\n-19.2 \n\n-9.5 \n\n-3.4 \n\n5.6 \n\n-7.6 \n\n-15.8 \n\n-18.0 \n\n-3.3 \n\n-0.9 \n\n10.2 \n\n0.3 \n\n-10.9 \n\n-11.4 \n\n0.6 \n\nGiven Singapore\u2019s economic structure, i.e., low private consumption, high investment, \nand extremely high levels of exports and imports (Table 27), it is not surprising that the \ncountry has been severely affected by a collapse in exports.

Targeted  assistance  for  the  poor  include  public  transport  vouchers, \nand financial assistance for education  \n\nFifth: building a home for the future, at USD4.4 billion  \n\n\u2022  This  amount  will  go  to  developing  infrastructure  and  expanded  provisions  for \n\neducation and healthcare. \n\nGiven the structure of the economy, the key elements of the package were designed \nto  ensure  that  the  leakage  in  terms  of  spending  on  imports  would  be  minimized.  A \nmajor feature of the package was the provision of a cash credit to employers against \nemployee salaries. However, the major problem faced here was a decline in external \ndemand  rather  than  wage  competitiveness.  In  addition,  although  employers  were \nencouraged  to  keep  workers  employed  by  this  initiative,  with  the  stimulus  for  bank \nlending  also  seeking  the  same  aim,  there  was  no  assistance  forthcoming  for  those \nrendered redundant.  \n\nMuch of the assistance to households was targeted to those employed in low paying \nwork  through  the  Workfare  Income  Supplement.  Smaller  amounts  were  targeted  as \nsupport for families. Overall, the response was skewed in favor of businesses, at the \nexpense  of  those  employees  made  redundant.  All  payments  and  credits  were \ndisbursed  in  a  timely  manner  in  2009.  Increases  in  government  consumption \nexpenditure were the only positive items of expenditure playing a timely and significant \nrole in preventing an even sharper contraction. \n\nFiscal Space and Fiscal Sustainability \n\n \n\nWith  large  current  account  surpluses  and  official  reserves,  as  well  as  undisclosed \namounts  of  government  assets  and  no  debt,  there  is  little  doubt  that  Singapore \npossesses vast fiscal space (Table 29). Additionally, the projected deficit as a result of \n\n37 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \nthe  fiscal  package  is  estimated  to  be  about  3.5%  of  GDP  and  will  not  require  any \nborrowing.  \n\nTable 29: Singapore\u2013Selected Indicators of Fiscal Space, 2008  \n\nIndicator \n\nValue  \n\nDeficit/GDP \n\n1.5 surplus to 6.5% deficit \n(before inclusion of net \ninvestment income and \nother adjustments and 3.5% \nafter) \n113.7% \n14.8%  \n99% \nN/A \n6.9 months  \nNo borrowing required \n\nDebt/GDP \nCurrent Account/GDP \nReserves/GDP  \nReserves to short-term debt \nReserves to months of imports \nFunding  \n\nGDP = gross domestic product \n\nSource: Computed from the IMF International Financial Statistics, various issues \n\nThe Budget speech announced that although the government had sufficient savings to \nfund  the  budget  deficit,  the  Resilience  Package  contained  temporary  extraordinary \nmeasures  which  were  not  part  of  a  normal  countercyclical  budget;  these  would  be \nfunded  from  past  reserves.  Accordingly,  the  case  was  made  to  the  President  for  the \ncost of these measures to be funded from the past reserves, on the grounds that the \ncircumstances faced were exceptional. The President gave his assent. It was also felt \nthat tapping on past reserves provided flexibility to respond to future uncertainties. \n\nOf  all  the  countries  included  in  this  study,  Singapore  is  in  the  best  position  to \nundertake a fiscal stimulus in response to the global financial crisis. Singapore\u2019s fiscal \nstimulus challenges stem from the limits of fiscal policy in a highly open economy with \na high savings rates. In the longer term, however, Singapore will need to rebalance its \neconomy. This will mean an increase in consumption and less export orientation. With \nits  small  population,  Singapore  will  always  have  to  be  export-oriented  in  order  to \nsurvive. There is scope for a more consumption-oriented economy, but this will require \na fundamental shift in the Singapore economic model, which has been one of the most \nsuccessful in the world. \n\nSingapore has a very high savings rate of about 43% of GDP, a result of household, \ngovernment,  and  corporate  savings.  Although  the  current  level  of  contribution  to  the \nCPF for individuals is high, it is generally considered inadequate to retire on, given that \nmuch of it is also withdrawn for other purposes prior to retirement, particularly housing \nand  health.  Individuals  have  to  save  over  and  above  this  amount  as  there  is  no \nuniversal  pension,  and  state  expenditure  on  health  is  low,  particularly given  a rapidly \naging  population.  Thus,  for  social  security  to  be  provided  by  the  state\u2014something \nwhich  most  economies  at  Singapore\u2019s  level  of  per  capita  GDP  are  already  doing\u2014\nspace  must  be  found  within  the  current  budget  outlays  and  revenue  must  be \nincreased, otherwise the state will have to run lower budget surpluses. \n\nCurrently, the largest item of expenditure in the Singapore budget is defense, which is \na strategic priority of the government (Ghesquiere 2007). There is mandatory national \nservice for all male citizens and permanent residents aged 18.

The  top  tax  rate  for  individuals  is  20%,  and  no  taxes  are  paid  on \nincome  up  to  SGD20,000  per  year.  Those  on  the  median  income  of  SGD2500  per \nmonth pay about SGD350 per annum in taxes annually. As for corporate taxes, no tax \nis payable for the first SGD100,000 dollars; a tax rate of 8.5% applies to amounts up to \nSGD$300,000, and a 17% flat rate applies to amounts over SGD300,000. Low taxes \nfor individuals and corporations have been useful in attracting foreign investment and \ntalent as well as keeping the incentive to work high. However, it also renders the tax \nsystem less able to act as an automatic stabiliser. \n\nThere is scope for a gradual shift to providing a state-funded social safety net for the \nelderly  and  poor,  if  the  goal  of  high  cumulative  surpluses  is  replaced  with  one  of \nbalancing the budget over the business cycle. However, this will require a fundamental \nchange in ideology. \n\n4.  CONCLUSION \n\nThis  study  examined  some  of  the  fiscal  policy  issues  and  challenges  confronted  by \ndeveloping  countries  in  using  countercyclical  fiscal  policy  to  ameliorate  the  impact  of \nthe  global  financial  crisis.  A  case  study  approach  examined  the  experience  of  four \ndeveloping Asian countries and revealed a rich diversity both in terms of the size and \ncomposition of fiscal stimulus and the challenges which are confronted.  \n\nThe case for discretionary fiscal policy is unequivocal, given that automatic stabilizing \nimpulses  are  weak.  On  the  expenditure  side,  this  is  mainly  due  to  the  absence  of \nsocial safety nets embedded into the expenditure side of the budget. This may be less \npronounced  on  the  revenue  side,  as  revenues  decline  with  slower  economic  activity. \nHowever, this decline may not be as pronounced as in developed countries, since the \nproportion of revenues derived from income taxes is much lower. Thus, employing tax \n\n40 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \ncuts  as  a  major  component  of  a \nimplemented\u2014may not be effective. \n\nfiscal  package\u2014while  quickly  and  easily \n\nCountries such as Indonesia, which have relied on tax cuts as a major component of \nits fiscal package, face a number of difficulties stemming primarily from the high level \nof  labor  market  informality.  Microeconomic  reforms  in  this  arena  can  spur  growth  by \nincreasing productivity and improving the effectiveness of fiscal policy, thus rendering \nit  less  regressive.  In  the  case  of  others  which  have  employed  either  corporate  or \npersonal  tax  cuts,  the  impact  is  muted  because  tax  rates  were  low  in  the  first  place. \nAttention needs to be focused on tax reforms in this area. \n\nSince  automatic  stabilizing  impulses  are  weak,  it  is  imperative  that  spending \nassociated with the fiscal stimulus be disbursed quickly, both to reduce the severity of \nthe crisis as well to avoid the procyclical impacts of fiscal policy. In countries such as \nIndonesia,  which  have  longstanding  problems  with  budget  execution,  or  Malaysia, \nwhere  spending  has  been  slower  than  anticipated,  direct  cash  handouts  to  poor \nhouseholds could be considered. \n\nThe  lack  of  fiscal  space  and  fiscal  sustainability  issues  also  present  serious \nconstraints.  This  has  been  a  key  issue  for  the  Philippines  and,  to  a  lesser  extent, \nMalaysia. In the Philippines, increased expenditure in the short-term must be weighed \nagainst  long  standing  concerns  on  fiscal  sustainability.  Increasing  tax  revenues  is \nparamount,  both \nincreasing  expenditure  on  social  services  and \nterms  of \nsafeguarding fiscal sustainability.  \n\nin \n\nIn  the  Malaysian  case,  fiscal  space  can  be  created  within  the  budget  through  a \nreduction in subsidies and better targeting of subsidies to the poor. In the longer term, \nattention  should  be focused  on reducing  reliance  on  petroleum revenues,  introducing \nthe  VAT,  trimming  the  size  of  the  public  sector  and  public  financial  enterprises,  and \nrefraining from producing chronic budget deficits. \n\nThe impact of expansionary fiscal policy has also been muted by the structure of the \neconomy,  particularly  in  the  case  of  highly  open  economies  with  low  consumption, \nsuch  as  Singapore  and  Malaysia.  In  this  case,  policies  to  rebalance  growth  towards \nmore domestic consumption should be seriously considered. In the case of Malaysia, \nrecent  initiatives  to  liberalize  the  services  sector  should  be  pursued  more  vigorously. \nMoving  away  from  an  export  mindset  and  reviewing  fiscal  incentives  provided  for \nexports  should  also  be  conducted.  Increased  consumption  would  be  encouraged  if \nmore  social  safety  nets  were  provided.  In  the  case  of  Singapore,  the  fiscal  space  to \nprovide  state  funded  social  safety  nets  can  realistically  be  accomplished  if  budgets \nwere balanced over the cycle. \n\nIn summary, this study identifies several steps that countries might take to improve the \nimpact of expansionary fiscal policy in response to future downturns. These include (i) \nembedding  automatic  stabilizing  impulses  through  the  provision  of  social  safety  nets; \n(ii)  increasing  tax  revenues  collected  from  personal  and  corporate  taxes  by  reducing \nlabor  market  informality  through  improvements  in  the  business  environment;  (iii) \nsafeguarding  fiscal  sustainability;  (iv)  rebalancing  growth  by  strengthening  other \nsectors  of  the  economy;  (v)  reducing  expenditures  on  subsidies;  and  (vi)  ensuring \nsmooth and efficient budget execution. \n\n41 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 288                                                                                               Doraisami \n                                                                                                          \n \n\nREFERENCES  \n\nAugustina, C., J.

This  study  identifies  some  of  the  issues  and  policy  implications \nassociated  with  this  policy  response  in  developing  countries.  Included  are  case  studies  of \nfour  developing  countries  in  the  Asian  region\u2014Malaysia,  Indonesia,  the  Philippines,  and \nSingapore.  The  findings  point  to  a  rich  diversity  in  both  the  size  and  composition  of  fiscal \nstimulus  and  the  challenges  which  are  confronted.  This  study  suggests  several  steps  that \ncountries might take to improve the impact of expansionary fiscal policy in response to future \ndownturns. These include (i) embedding automatic stabilizing impulses through the provision \nof  social  safety  nets;  (ii)  increasing  tax  revenues  collected  from  personal  and  corporate \ntaxes,  by  reducing  labor  market  informality  through  improvements  in  the  business \nenvironment; (iii) safeguarding fiscal sustainability; (iv) rebalancing growth by strengthening \nother  sectors  of  the  economy;  (v)  reducing  expenditures  on  subsidies;  and  (vi)  ensuring \nsmooth and efficient budget execution. \n", " \nJEL Classification: E60, E61, E62, E63\n", " \n"]}
