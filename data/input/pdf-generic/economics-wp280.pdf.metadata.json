Introduction\nThe Asia and Pacific region is extraordinarily diverse, but all of the economies are \nexperiencing a demographic transition with important common features related to \npopulation size, growth, and age structure. In many of them, demographic change \nfavors economic growth in both aggregate and per capita terms because working-age \npopulations are growing more rapidly than dependent populations and are creating a \ndemographic dividend. In a few economies in the region and in many more in the near \nfuture, however, the obviously favorable demographics are coming to an end. They \nwill experience slower growth and then declines in their working-age populations and \nsubstantial increases in their old-age populations. We explore how these demographic \nchanges are likely to influence economic growth and other features of economies in the \nAsia and Pacific region. Several key findings emerge. \n(i)  Many countries including Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and the \nPhilippines will continue to experience a demographic dividend as their working-\nage populations grow relative to their dependent populations. Favorable conditions \nshould persist for at least the next 15 years and, in most cases, for much longer. \n(ii)  The magnitude of the demographic dividend depends on age patterns of labor \nincome and consumption. For most countries estimates of these patterns are not \navailable, but based on eight economies of the region for which age profiles have \nbeen constructed, a substantial demographic dividend can be expected.\n(iii)  Over time, the populations of the Asia and Pacific region will become increasingly \nconcentrated at older ages where in all cases labor income is quite modest. In \npart this reflects low levels of employment at older ages, but it also reflects low \nwages and productivity for older adults who are working. \n(iv)  Low labor income is often matched with high consumption among the elderly in \nhigh-income countries. This pattern is true of Asia as well although the picture is \nmore mixed. In middle- and low-income countries, the elderly are consuming at \nlevels similar to those for other adults.\n(v)  Population aging could serve as a drag on economic growth over the coming \ndecades as the effective number of workers declines relative to the effective \nnumber of consumers. East Asia faces the most serious problems. In the Republic \nof Korea, for example, the support ratio is expected to decline by 0.8% per year ", "2 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 280\nover the next 40 years. In the absence of compensating changes, standards of \nliving would thus be reduced by more than 25% between 2010 and 2050. \n(vi)  A second potential problem from population aging is the strain on public transfer \nsystems. The old-age transfer system is relatively underdeveloped in many Asian \ncountries so the effects would be smaller than those in Japan, Europe, or Latin \nAmerica, but the effects will still be large. In a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d simulation, \ntransfer wealth (or implicit debt) would range from 90% of total labor income in the \nPacific island nations to 240% of total labor income in East Asia by 2050. \n(vii)  If countries in the region were to shift toward consumption, labor income, and \ntransfer patterns characteristic of rich countries, implicit debt would increase \nto much higher levels. For the Asian Development Bank\u2019s developing member \ncountries (DMCs), implicit debt would reach 320% of total labor income in 2030 \nand 540% of total labor income in 2050. \n(viii)  Population aging will lead to substantial capital deepening. For the DMCs as a \nwhole, given their low income profiles, pension assets would rise from 1.2 times \ntotal labor income to 2.1 times total labor income in 2030 and to 2.7 times in \n2050. Capital deepening should provide a boost to economic growth that easily \ndominates the effects of a declining support ratio. \n(ix)  Given current patterns of old-age consumption, production, and transfers, the \ntotal demand for pension assets will increase very substantially over the coming \ndecades, rising from $26 trillion in 2010 to $157 trillion in 2050. \n(x)  Under these circumstances, aging should not depress savings rates. The gross \nsavings rates required to meet the demand for pension assets would increase \nfrom 12.2% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010\u20132020 to 15.4% of GDP in \n2040\u20132050. The view that population aging will lead to lower savings rates is not \nborne out by the analysis presented here. \nII.  The First Demographic Dividend\nA change in population age structure has a very direct, first-order effect on income \nand consumption that does not depend on behavioral responses. An increase in the \npopulation concentrated in the working ages, given output per worker, leads to an \nincrease in output or income per person. Holding the savings rate constant in addition \nto output per worker, an increase in the share of persons in the working ages leads to \nhigher consumption per person (Bloom and Williamson 1998, Mason 2001, Mason and \nLee 2007). ", "Population, Wealth, and Economic Growth in the Asia and Pacific Region | 3\nThe demographic dividend follows from a simple identity: \nC Y L\n=(1\u2212s) ,\nN L N\n  (1)\nwhere C/N is per capita consumption, s is the savings rate, Y/L is income per worker, \nand L/N is the support ratio, i.e., the number of workers per person. How changes in \npopulation age structure influence the savings rate and output per worker is an important \nand complex issue. The effects of changes in population age structure through the \nsupport ratio, however, are direct and unambiguous. Age transitions in Asia, the Pacific, \nand elsewhere are leading to swings in population concentrations in the working ages and \nswings in the support ratio matched by swings in per capita income and consumption. \nThe relationship between consumption growth and growth in the support ratio can also be \nreadily represented as a simple transformation of equation. Let gr[] represent the growth \nrate: \ngr[C N]=gr[1\u2212s]+gr[Y L]+gr[L N].\n  (2)\nHolding the savings rate and income per worker constant, the growth rate of income per \ncapita and consumption are equal to the growth rate of the support ratio.1  \nResearchers have constructed the support ratio in different ways. One approach is to \nuse a purely demographic measure: the population in the working ages divided by the \ntotal population. The approach used here is to incorporate age variation in the numerator \nand denominator that reflects systematic differences in labor income and consumption \nover the life cycle. A similar approach was used by Cutler et al. relying on very simple \nassumptions (Cutler et al. 1990). Here we exploit newly available, detailed estimates of \nconsumption and labor income profiles to construct the support ratio. \nThe value of labor provided by an additional individual of any age depends on age \npatterns of labor force participation, hours worked, unemployment rates, and productivity. \nIn general, the value of labor rises at young adult ages and then declines later in life, \nbut details vary across countries influenced by features of the labor market, investment \nin education, returns on experience, skill obsolescence, disability patterns, employment \npractices, mandatory retirement policies, tax and pension systems, and so forth. \nConsumption also varies systematically with age because of tastes, physiological factors, \nand many other issues. Age variation in consumption should not be ignored. The very \nyoung do not produce, but they may not consume much. In some countries, the elderly \ndo not produce much, but they consume a great deal. Hence, an important refinement \nof the support ratio is to incorporate age variation in the value of goods and services \n1  The growth rate of per capita income is equal to the sum of the second and third terms on the right-hand side.", "4 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 280\nproduced and consumed at each age. This is accomplished by constructing a support \nratio that uses weighted population:\n\u2211y (x)P(x,t)\nL 0\nt = x ,\nN \u2211c (x)P(x,t)\nt 0\nx   (3)\nwhere y (x)is the labor income age profile in the base year, c (x)is the consumption \n0 0\nprofile in the base year, and P(x,t)is the population by age x.2 \nTwo strategies have been employed in recent studies to estimate the demographic \ndividend. One approach is to apply a regression analysis to pooled, cross-section, \ntime series data for national economies. This approach has been used by Bloom and \nWilliamson (1998), Bloom and Canning (2001), and Kelley and Schmidt (1995 and 2007). \nAn alternative approach is to rely on simulation models of varying complexities (Mason \n2001; Mason and Lee 2007; Mason, Lee et al. 2010; Romero, Patxot et al. 2010). Either \napproach supports the view that the demographic dividend has been quantitatively \nimportant, especially in East Asia. \nThe rate of growth of the support ratio\u2014the first demographic dividend\u2014varies in its \ntiming and magnitude in each economy depending on the speed and magnitude of \nchanges in population age structure. In East Asia, for example, the age transition has \nbeen very rapid, and the swings in age structure have been very large. Changes in \nthe support ratio also depend on policies, institutions, and behavioral differences that \ninfluence the ages at which people enter and leave the labor force, age variation in \nunemployment and hours worked, and age patterns of unemployment. Also influencing it \nare factors that affect consumption at each age. Adding a child to a population will have \na smaller effect than adding an elderly adult if the child consumes less than the adult \n(Mason 2005). \nThe analysis presented below builds on these concepts and exploits newly available \nestimates of age patterns of labor income and consumption. New estimates of the \nsupport ratio and the first demographic dividend are presented, which show benefits from \nan increasing support ratio, but in the future, a declining support ratio will pervade in the \nregion.\n2  The labor income and consumption profiles are both normalized by dividing them by the average labor income of \nthose aged 30\u201349. The consumption profile is scaled so that the average consumption of those aged 30\u201349 is 60% \nof average labor income of those aged 30\u201349. This adjustment eliminates the effects of intercountry differences in \nsavings rates on the support ratio. ", "Population, Wealth, and Economic Growth in the Asia and Pacific Region | 5\nIII.  The Second Demographic Dividend\nThe support ratio quantifies the first-order effect on income or consumption of changes \nin the population age structure. Income per capita varies in direct proportion to changes \nin the support ratio given income per worker; consumption per capita varies in direct \nproportion to changes in the support ratio given income per worker and the savings rate. \nIn the absence of other changes, age transition can lead to more rapid economic growth, \nbut with population aging, the support ratio declines and economic growth is curtailed. \nResponses to demographic changes by individuals, families, firms, and governments may, \nhowever, lead to very different and possibly more favorable outcomes. \nIn general, societies can respond to changes in population age structure in one of four \nways. One possibility is to allow consumption to vary. Standards of living will rise as the \nsupport ratio becomes more favorable and will decline as it deteriorates. This would be \nthe inevitable outcome if societies relied exclusively on transfer programs to meet the \nneeds of dependent populations. Transfer systems can affect the distribution of income \nand consumption but not the totals; hence, per capita income and consumption will rise \nand fall with the support ratio.\nA second possible response is to change policies or behaviors that link change in \npopulation age structure to the support ratio. People can work longer by delaying \nretirement, and women may choose to enter the formal labor force in greater numbers \nin part as a result of lower fertility. As older adults enjoy longer, healthier lives, delaying \nretirement appears to be a natural response. Policies that prohibit and discourage older \nworkers from continuing their employment can be reformed. Consumption patterns, \nparticularly spending on health care and long-term care, are also very important.\nA third possibility is to increase investment in human capital. Low fertility results in \nrelatively fewer workers, but increased spending on human capital can make them more \nproductive. This possibility is discussed in some detail by Lee and Mason (2010), Ogawa \net al. (2009), and Prettner and Prskawetz (2010). \nA fourth possible response is that workers may increase their savings in order to fund \na longer period of retirement. They may do this through personal savings, through \npension systems funded by employers, or through publicly funded retirement programs. \nThis response initially leads to higher savings and lower consumption, but the additional \ncapital that is generated is growth-enhancing, and eventually income per worker rises, \noffsetting to some extent the decline in the support ratio. Not all changes in savings and \nwealth are necessarily behavioral, however, and changes in the age composition of the \npopulation also have an important influence. ", "6 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 280\nIV.  Population, Savings, and Wealth  \nConcerns often raised about population aging are that it will lead to lower savings rates \nand a decline in capital and to all of the attendant economic problems, e.g., slower \neconomic growth and a collapse in asset prices. Among mainstream economists, \nhowever, the most familiar idea about the relationship between population and capital is \nembodied in the Solow growth model. Solow showed that given a constant savings rate, \nslower labor force growth would lead to an increase in capital per worker and per capita \nincome (Solow 1956). Thus, in the simple accounting identity\u2014equation (2)\u2014changes in \nthe growth rate of the labor force will influence output per worker. Given the savings rate, \na decline in the support ratio due to a decline in the growth rate of the effective labor \nforce will lead to capital deepening and to higher income per capita. Capital deepening \ninduced by slower labor force growth will to some extent offset the effect on economic \ngrowth of the decline in the support ratio that occurs as populations grow more slowly \nand age. \nTo understand how changes in population age structure influence the capital\u2013output ratio \nand labor productivity, it is essential to understand how the aggregate savings rate is \ninfluenced by changes in population age structure. Many studies have addressed this \nissue relying on the life cycle savings model. Tobin (1967) extended the neoclassical \ngrowth model with endogenous life cycle savings. Cutler et al. (1990) explored the effects \nof aging using a Ramsey framework and concluded that population aging would lead to \nhigher standards of living because a lower savings rate would be needed to maintain \nthe capital output ratio in an aging United States (US) economy. Mason and Lee (2007) \nmodeled a small open economy and showed that population aging would lead to a \nsubstantial increase in assets that would be sufficient to offset the effects on per capita \nconsumption of a decline in the support ratio, but only if there were strong reliance on \nlife cycle savings to fund old-age retirement. If countries rely primarily on either public \nor private transfers to support retirement needs, population aging leads to a significant \ndecline in per capita income and per capita consumption. \nA similar conclusion is reached for a closed economy in equilibrium (Lee and Mason \n2010, Romero et al. 2010) and in economies with immigration (Mason et al. 2010). These \nstudies vary in their details but agree that population aging may lead to an increase \nin capital and standards of living because it will not lead to a decline in savings rates \nsufficient to offset the capital deepening effects of slower labor force growth. An important \npoint, however, is that the link between population aging, savings, and capital will depend \nto a significant degree on the extent to which saving is motivated by life cycle concerns. \nThis, in turn, will depend on the extent to which the elderly are relying on continued work, \nadult children, and public transfer programs rather than on personal wealth to support old-\nage consumption. ", "Population, Wealth, and Economic Growth in the Asia and Pacific Region | 7\nMany studies have considered the effects of changes in population age structure on \nsavings rates. Relying on variants of the life cycle model, several have used aggregate, \ncross-section, time series data to estimate the effects of age structure on aggregate \nsavings (Mason 1981, Fry and Mason 1982, Mason 1988, Higgins and Williamson 1997, \nHiggins 1998, Bosworth and Chodorow-Reich 2007) and have concluded that savings \nrates will rise and then fall over the course of the demographic transition. \nThe strong effects on savings of population age structure are often driven by savings \nrates in Asia which have experienced especially large swings during the demographic \ntransition. Several explanations have been offered for why these patterns have been \nso important in Asia including the rapid rate of economic growth, less reliance on public \ntransfer systems for old-age support, and the speed of the demographic transition. Using \nboth historical and contemporary data, Kinugasa (2004) and Kinugasa and Mason (2007) \nshowed that rapid increases in life expectancy led to high savings rates and increases in \nwealth per capita. An important feature of their result is that the finding in contemporary \neconomies is confined to Asia where transfer systems tend to be less important for old-\nage support than they are in Europe and Latin America. \nThe empirical evidence about savings and demography is far from settled as saving may \nbe very context dependent in ways that have not been fully captured by empirical models \n(Zhang and Zhang 2005). Another difficulty is that behavioral responses to population \naging are quite complex. Increases in life expectancy and the duration of retirement \nmay influence the age at retirement (Bloom et al. 2003), the extent to which the elderly \ncan rely on family members for support, and the magnitude of public transfer systems \n(Preston 1984). \nSimulation analyses have often been used to consider the implications of population age \nstructure for life cycle savings. One value of such models is to assess whether the large \nswings in savings rates observed in Asian countries, for example, can be explained by \nthe life cycle model. Most studies have concluded that demographic change produces \nswings in savings rates that are more modest than the observed changes and more \nmodest than those implied by empirical studies. Lee, Mason et al. (2003), for example, \nconcluded that changes in age structure can explain US savings trends but not the \nsharp increases in savings in Taipei,China which can instead be explained by changes in \npopulation age structure combined with a rapid shift in the old-age support system from \nfamilial transfers to life cycle savings. ", "8 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 280\nV.  The Economic Life Cycle\nChanges in population age structure matter only because the human life cycle influences \neconomic behavior in important, fundamental ways. During the periods of \u201cdependency\u201d \nat the beginning and the end of life, we consume much more than we produce through \nour labor. Sandwiched between is a period during which we consume much less than we \nproduce through our labor. This economic life cycle is central to our analysis. First, the \ninteraction between the economic life cycle and population age structure determines the \nsupport ratio and the magnitude of the demographic dividend. The economic life cycle is \ncritical to the timing and magnitude of the dividend and is also critical to identifying ways \nin which changes in behavior or policies might influence it. Second, the economic life \ncycle is the fundamental building block for life cycle savings as it determines life cycle \nneeds for accumulating wealth. \nThe National Transfer Accounts (NTA) provide comprehensive estimates of economic \nflows by age in a manner consistent with national income and product accounts; research \nteams in 35 countries are currently constructing them. In Asia, accounts have been \nconstructed for eight economies:  the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC); India; Indonesia; \nJapan; the Republic of Korea; Philippines; Taipei,China; and Thailand (Lee et al. 2008, \nMason et al. 2009, Lee and Mason 2011). Detailed information about NTA is available at \nwww.ntaccounts.org. \nThe economic life cycle is defined by age profiles of labor income and consumption. \nLabor income is a comprehensive measure of the value of labor production at each age \nreflecting age variation in labor force participation, unemployment rates, hours worked, \nand wages. Labor income includes the estimated value of labor of unpaid family workers \nwho often are young or old. Also included are benefits provided by employers including \ntheir contributions to publicly funded social security programs. Labor income does not, \nhowever, include the value of time spent in child rearing and other important forms of in-\nhome production. \nConsumption is also a comprehensive measure that is both public and private. Public \neducation and publicly funded health care, for example, are allocated to age groups \nrelying on a combination of administrative records and household surveys. Nonassignable \npublic consumption is allocated to age groups in proportion to the population in those age \ngroups. Private consumption is allocated to age groups using nationally representative \nhousehold surveys. Detailed methods are described in the references provided above. \nNTA estimates are currently available for 23 economies. Per capita labor income and \nconsumption profiles are charted in Figure 1 using simple averages in four different \ngroups. The low-income group includes the 12 economies with the lowest per capita \nincomes, and the high-income group includes the 11 with higher per capita incomes. \nIn Asia, the low-income group includes the PRC, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, ", "Population, Wealth, and Economic Growth in the Asia and Pacific Region | 9\nand Thailand. The high-income group includes Japan; the Republic of Korea; and \nTaipei,China. \nFigure 1:  Per Capita Consumption and Labor Income by Age in Low- and High-Income \nEconomies  \nRelative to Mean\nLabor Income 30\u201349 \n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\nAge\nAsia Low c Asia Low yl Asia High c\nAsia High yl Low Income c Low Income yl\nHigh Income c High Income yl\nc = consumption, yl = labor income.\nSources:   Lee and Mason, forthcoming; NTA database, available: www.ntaccounts.org, accessed 12 May 2011. \nThe labor income profiles for high-income economies and Asian high-income economies \nare very similar except that labor income is somewhat higher in Asia than in the combined \nhigh-income profile. Likewise, the labor income profile in the low-income economies of \nAsia is very similar to that in low-income economies in general though it has a somewhat \ndifferent profile than that in high-income economies. In low-income economies, labor \nincome rises at a somewhat earlier age but a bit more slowly than in high-income \neconomies. The peaks come at similar ages. At older ages, low-income economies have \nrelatively high labor incomes. \nThe consumption profile for low-income Asian economies is not much different than that \nof low-income countries in general. Consumption rises with age during childhood and \nthen is remarkably flat across adult ages. In high-income economies, child consumption \nis higher at all ages, particularly among school-age children. Human capital spending on \nchildren is very high in high-income Asian economies, and the consumption profile is not \nflat over the adult ages. Consumption is higher among adults in their late 50s and 60s \ncompared with younger adults. \nStarting in the late 60s or early 70s, consumption rises steeply in non-Asian high-income \ncountries but is less pronounced in Asia. The steep increase is primarily a consequence ", "10 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 280\nof high levels of spending on health and long-term care. Asia\u2019s high-income economies \nare quite varied, however. Consumption rises steeply at older ages in Japan, less so in \nTaipei,China, and actually declines in the Republic of Korea. It must be kept in mind that \nthese estimates are for a year near 2000. Some important changes may have occurred \nin recent years, but the key features of the profiles are quite persistent based on a \npreliminary analysis of time series estimates. \nAggregate consumption and labor income by age vary considerably as population \nage structure changes. This point is illustrated in Figure 2, which compares aggregate \nconsumption and production by age in India with aggregate consumption and production \nby age in Japan. In India, the life cycle deficit for children\u2014the difference between their \nconsumption and labor income\u2014is enormous while the life cycle deficit for the elderly is \nrelatively small. In Japan, however, the old-age deficit for the elderly is somewhat larger \nthan the deficit for the young. Although the per capita profiles for India differ from Japan\u2019s, \npopulation age structure is the main cause for the difference in the aggregate profiles for \nthese two countries and for other countries that have been studied. \nFigure 2: Aggregate Consumption and Labor Income by Age in Japan and India in 2004\nPercent of Total Japan \nLabor Income \n4.0\n3.5\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\nAge\nPercent of Total India \nLabor Income \n3.5\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\nAge\nConsumption Labor Income\nSource:   National Transfer Accounts database, www.ntaccounts.org accessed 12 May 2011. ", "Population, Wealth, and Economic Growth in the Asia and Pacific Region | 11\nStudies of the economic implications of population age structure usually emphasize the \noverall level of dependency using the support ratio, the dependency ratio, or a similar \nmeasure. The next section follows this approach by describing changes in the support \nratio that are occurring in Asia. This is a very useful starting point for considering the \neconomic implications of changes in population age structure, but it is very important to \nkeep in mind that it is only a starting point. \nVI. Support Ratio\nThe support ratio shown in equation (3) for the Asia and Pacific economies was \nconstructed using population data and the age profiles of consumption and labor income \nshown in Figure 1. The population data were taken from United Nations (UN) population \nestimates and projections based on the medium fertility scenario. For the base year labor \nincome and consumption weights, the low-income Asian profiles were used except for \nJapan; Hong Kong, China; Malaysia; the Republic of Korea; Singapore; and Taipei,China \nwhere high-income profiles were used. See Appendix Table 1 for detailed estimates.\nThe East Asian DMCs in the second panel of Figure 3 are distinctive because their \nage transition has been so rapid. The PRC provides a useful benchmark against which \nother countries can be compared. The support ratio declined between 1950 and the \nearly 1970s due to improved child survival then began to increase as a consequence of \nlower birth rates and child dependency. This increase has continued since 1972, but it is \ncurrently very close to its peak. In the coming decades, the support ratio will decline as \nsmaller cohorts begin entering the labor force and as the elderly live to older ages. By \n2050, the support ratio in the PRC will be only slightly greater than it was in 1950. \nAs in the PRC, the support ratio declined in most Asian developing countries and then \nincreased in essentially all of them though the point at which it began to increase varied \nconsiderably. A broad perspective on the growth in the support ratios is provided in \nFigure 4, which plots their growth rates in each economy against the rate of growth of \nthe effective number of producers during four periods.

Appendix Table 1 \nsummarizes the support ratio for all the Asia and Pacific economies for which estimates \ncould be constructed. \nVII.  Life Cycle Wealth, Pensions, and Transfer Systems\nThe economic life cycle is key to understanding how changes in population age structure \ninfluence the demand for life cycle wealth. Basic concepts are illustrated based on the \nexperience of Japan before we look in more depth at the situation across the Asia\u2013Pacific \nregion. \nA.   Life Cycle Wealth in Japan\nThe relationship between demographics and the demand for life cycle wealth can be \ncalculated given age profiles of consumption and labor income. For any cohort of adults \naged x in year t, life cycle wealth is defined as the present value of lifetime consumption \nless the present value of lifetime labor income. This follows directly from the lifetime \nbudget constraint and the assumption of no bequests. Life cycle wealth is the wealth \nnecessary to realize a particular level of consumption at each future age given labor \nincome at each future age. In order to construct a measure of life cycle wealth, we \nmade several simplifying assumptions. First, the shapes of the age profiles of per \ncapita consumption and labor income do not change over time, but they shift upward \nat a constant rate of growth. Second, the population is closed to immigration. Third, the \ndiscount rate is exogenous and constant. This removes potentially important general \nequilibrium considerations or economic feedback that has been explored in other studies \ndiscussed above. \nTwo demographic factors are considered here: changes in life expectancy that influence \nan individual\u2019s savings and changes in age structure that arise due both to longer life \nexpectancy and to fertility declines. First, the effects of longer life expectancy on savings \nare analyzed by calculating the path of life cycle wealth over the life cycle for three \ndifferent synthetic cohorts subject to the mortality conditions that prevailed in Japan in \n1949, 1979, and 2009. Japan\u2019s mortality experience is quite useful for considering the \neffects of longer life expectancy because in the aftermath of World War II, Japan had \nthe shortest life expectancy of any industrialized country; now it has the longest. Thus, \nthe simulated changes for Japan are the maximum one could anticipate over a 60-year \nperiod. ", "16 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 280\nThe effect of gains in life expectancy on the demand for life cycle pension wealth may \nseem obvious to those who are not demographers. If people live longer but do not work \nlonger, they must accumulate more wealth to support their old-age consumption. Gains \nin life expectancy, however, add years at all ages. When life expectancy is low, the \ngains tend to be concentrated at younger ages when people are both consuming and \nproducing. As life expectancy reaches high levels, additional gains are concentrated at \nold ages where the effects on the demand for life cycle wealth are clear. \nFigure 5 shows the demand for life cycle pension wealth using the per capita \nconsumption and labor income profiles for Japan in 2004 (Ogawa et al. 2010) and age-\nspecific mortality rates for Japan in 1949, 1979, and 2009 (Human Mortality Database). \nThese values are for synthetic cohorts based on the assumption that mortality conditions \nremain constant at the levels observed in a particular year. The present value is \ncalculated using a discount rate of 3%. \nFigure 5: Simulated Per Capita Life Cycle Pension Wealth by Age for Japan  \nLife Cycle Wealth /\nYl(30\u201349)\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n40 50 60 70 80 90\nAge\ne0=56.9 e0=76.2 e0=87.3\ne0 = life expectancy, yl = labor income.\nSource:  Consumption and labor income profiles are NTA estimates for Japan in 2004 (Ogawa et al. 2010). Life expectancy and age-\nspecific mortality rates are estimates for Japan for 1949, 1979, and 2009 (Human Mortality Database 2011, available: www.\nmortality.org, accessed 12 May 2011).\nLife cycle wealth for each mortality level follows the classic life cycle pattern rising as \nindividuals approach retirement, peaking during the early to mid-60s, and then declining. \nThe accumulation does not begin until around age 40 because of the costs of child \nrearing that younger parents must bear. The profiles are shown only to age 90 but \nare calculated to higher ages (110 in 2009 and 1979; 107 in 1949). Given longer life \nexpectancy, accumulation begins at a somewhat earlier age and is substantially higher at \nevery age once begun. ", "Population, Wealth, and Economic Growth in the Asia and Pacific Region | 17\nThe upward shift in the age profile of life cycle wealth generated by the rise in life \nexpectancy is summarized in Table 3. The average of life cycle pension wealth is \ncalculated as a simple average of the values for ages 50\u201390 inclusive. Given 1949 \nmortality conditions, the average life cycle wealth per person was about 5 times the \naverage annual pre-tax labor income of a prime working-age (30\u201349) adult. The average \nrose to 6.7 times average labor income given 1979 mortality conditions and 9.2 times \nannual labor income given 2009 mortality conditions. \nTable 3: Life Expectancy and Life Cycle Pension Wealth in Japan \n1949 1979 2009\nLife expectancy at birth 56.9 76.2 87.3\nLife cycle pension wealth 5.08 6.72  9.17\nPartial effect 0.09 0.22\nElasticity 1.13 2.65\nNote:    Life cycle wealth is the simple average of values for those aged 50\u201390 normalized on labor income of those aged 30\u201349. \nPartial effect is change in wealth divided by the change in life expectancy. Elasticity is the percentage change in wealth \ndivided by the percentage change in life expectancy. Both measures are for the 30-year periods.\nSource:  Authors\u2019 calculations using the NTA database, available: www.ntaccounts.org, accessed 29 June 2011.\nThe gain in life expectancy was much greater between 1949 and 1979 than between \n1979 and 2009. The partial effect of an additional year of life expectancy is greater \nafter 1979. Between 1949 and 1979, a 1-year increase in life expectancy shifted the \nage profile of wealth upward by about 0.1 of the annual pretax labor income of a prime \nworking-age adult, but between 1979 and 2009, a 1-year increase shifted it upward by \nabout 0.2 (partial effect). A similar conclusion follows using elasticities to compare effects. \nA 1% increase in life expectancy led to a 1.1% increase in wealth between 1949 and \n1979 and to a 2.7% increase between 1979 and 2009. \nThe economywide demand for life cycle pension wealth depends on age structure as \nwell as on changes in the age profile of life cycle wealth. The Japanese demand for life \ncycle wealth peaks when cohorts are in their early 60s, hence an increased concentration \nof the population near these peak wealth ages leads to greater aggregate wealth. In \nthe special case of a steady-state population, the age distribution depends on the age \nschedule of survival and the rate of population growth (the fertility rate). A shift from low \nlife expectancy and a high rate of population growth\u2014characteristics of countries in the \nearly stages of the demographic transition\u2014yields a ratio of life cycle wealth-to-labor- \nincome of only 1.5 (Table 4). By comparison, rates characteristic of rapidly aging societies \n(a life expectancy of 87 and a population growth rate of \u20131% per year) yields a wealth-to- \nlabor-income ratio of 12.3.

In the next section, the same concepts \nare applied in a more detailed fashion to project life cycle wealth over the next 4 decades \nin the Asia and Pacific region. The analysis goes beyond this calculation, however, to \nassess the extent to which the demand for life cycle wealth will be met by accumulating \npension assets and by expanding transfers to support the elderly. \nB.   Life Cycle Wealth, Transfers, and Assets\nLife cycle wealth is projected by assuming that given age patterns of consumption and \nlabor income persist into the future while allowing for a constant and exogenous change \nin labor productivity due, for example, to technological progress. The objective of the \nprojections is to answer the following question: In the absence of a labor response, how \nmuch additional wealth is required to sustain consumption levels that keep pace with \nchanges in productivity?  In effect, two of the possible responses to population aging are \nruled out: sacrificing consumption and increasing work effort. \nThe additional wealth required to meet the needs of the elderly can be obtained in two \nways. One way is to establish or expand transfer programs that provide pensions and \nfund health care services and other needs of the elderly. The alternative is to accumulate \nassets that can fund these same needs. The projections presented here present \nalternatives based on the experience of NTA economies in Asia that differ considerably in \ntheir emphasis on transfers versus assets in funding old-age consumption. \nLife cycle wealth is projected in the following way. Two scenarios are constructed based \non the age profiles of per capita consumption and labor income for high- and low-income \nAsian NTA economies as shown in Figure 1. The consumption and labor income profiles \nare assumed to shift at a constant rate that is exogenously given. Total consumption \nand labor income at each age in a given year are calculated by combining the profiles of \nconsumption and labor income with the projected population for each cohort. The present \nvalue of consumption and labor income for each cohort is calculated using a constant \ndiscount rate. Life cycle wealth at each age is calculated as the difference between the \npresent value of consumption and labor income at each age. ", "Population, Wealth, and Economic Growth in the Asia and Pacific Region | 19\nLife cycle wealth arises in part to meet the needs of children, but our interest here is \nthe life cycle wealth required to meet the needs of the elderly. Life cycle pension wealth \nis defined as life cycle wealth used to fund consumption in old age. In order to isolate \nlife cycle pension wealth, we assumed that adults fund their children and then fund their \nretirements; hence, life cycle pension wealth is approximated by the positive portion of life \ncycle wealth held by older adults as shown for Japan in Figure 5. \nTransfers and asset-based reallocations as shares of consumption at each age are held \nconstant.3  Note that transfers include both public and private transfers including familial \ntransfers. We assumed that the ratio of pension assets to pension transfer wealth is equal \nto the ratio for adults 65 and older. Two age profiles of per capita net transfers by age \nare used, one from high-income Asian economies and the other from low-income Asian \neconomies. Asset-based reallocations are estimated as the balancing item drawing on \nthe identity that consumption must equal asset-based reallocations plus net transfers plus \nlabor income. \nThe population estimates and projections used here for 1950\u20132050 are from the UN \nPopulation Division, World Population Prospects 2008 (UN 2009).4  Longer-term \nprojections are required to calculate wealth because each cohort must be tracked over its \nentire lifetime. Thus, long-term projections prepared by the UN Population Division have \nbeen used to extend the standard population projections in such a way as to minimize \ndiscontinuities that are otherwise introduced into the calculations. Details are available \nfrom the authors. \nAs noted, life cycle wealth can be accumulated in the form of assets or transfer wealth. \nThese values are also projected by assuming that net transfers fund a constant share of \nconsumption by the elderly of a given age. Thus, the importance of net transfers to the \nelderly varies as the age distribution of the elderly population changes. As will be seen, \nthe very old are more reliant on transfers than the younger elderly, hence the importance \nof transfers increases as elderly populations become older. \nThe ratio of life cycle pension wealth to labor income is charted in Figures 6 and 7 at 10-\nyear intervals from 1950 to 2050 for regional groups. The average values are calculated \nusing GDP weights rather than as simple averages of the values for countries that are \nmembers of each group. Hence, the values for East Asia are dominated by the PRC, \nfor South Asia by India, and for non-DMCs by Japan. Country values are reported in \nAppendix Tables 2 and 3. \n3  This assumption means that the transfer burden on the non elderly will increase as populations age. \n4  The UN does not produce population projections for Taipei,China and for some small DMCs.

The first is that it begins \nto rise so early. In 1950 for the high-income profile, life cycle pension wealth is less than \ntwice total labor income, but by 1990 it has doubled. The second feature is that it reaches \nsuch high levels approaching 12 times aggregate labor income by 2050. By comparison, \nDMC regions experienced modest growth in life cycle pension wealth of about 1% per \nyear faster than the growth in labor income before 2000. In Central and West Asia, life \ncycle pension wealth actually declined relative to income during this period. The effects ", "Population, Wealth, and Economic Growth in the Asia and Pacific Region | 21\nof aging are very strong starting around 2000 particularly in East and Southeast Asia. In \nEast Asia, life cycle pension wealth is projected to grow by over 3% per year from 2010 \nto 2020 compared with productivity growth. For DMCs as a whole, growth in life cycle \npension wealth will slow over the next 4 decades but will remain above 1% relative to \nlabor income growth.\nLess life cycle pension wealth is required to maintain the low-income life cycle profiles \nthan the high-income profiles. Taking the DMCs as a whole, life cycle pension wealth is \nabout 25% lower though the trends are otherwise very similar, and the most rapid growth \nin wealth is concentrated between 2010 and 2030  (Figure 7).\nTable 5 shows pension transfer wealth for the Asia and Pacific region.

The low-income profile is based on both the low-income \neconomic life cycle and the low-income transfer profile while the high-income profile uses \nthe high-income life cycle and the high-income transfer profile. \nPension transfer wealth increases very sharply between 2010 and 2050. Given the \nlow-income profiles, pension transfer wealth almost triples for Central and West Asia, \nEast Asia, South Asia, the Pacific island nations, and DMCs as a whole. The growth is \nsomewhat slower in Southeast Asia. For the non-DMCs, pension transfer wealth does \nnot quite double.

This compares with total wealth in Japan of about 8 times \nGDP. Other regions in which pension transfer wealth would reach very high levels given \nhigh-income life cycle and transfer patterns are East Asia where it would reach 520% of \ntotal labor income in 2050 and Southeast Asia where it would reach 400% of total labor \nincome in 2050. \nPension transfer wealth would be lower if the low-income profiles of consumption, labor \nincome, and net transfers were to persist during the next 40 years. Among the DMCs, \nEast Asia would have the highest pension transfer wealth in 2050 at 240% of total labor \nincome. For all DMCs combined, pension transfer wealth would be 200% of total labor \nincome. Although these values are well below those required to follow the high-income \nprofile path, they are still substantial. The unfunded obligation needed to meet the \nneeds of the elderly in 2050 would be approaching twice the labor income of all workers \ncombined.\nThe elderly rely more on assets than transfers in low-income countries in Asia and \nelsewhere. The relative importance of net transfers and asset-based reallocations\u2014\nasset income less savings\u2014relative to consumption net of labor income varies with the \nage structure because the older elderly depend more on transfers and less on assets \ncompared with the younger elderly.

By 2050, however, the share of net transfers is projected to rise to 42% in \nDMCs and 49% in non-DMCs while asset-based reallocations will decline. For DMCs as \na whole for example, asset-based flows fund 64% of consumption net of labor income in \n2000 and 58% in 2050. \nTransfers are much more important and asset-based flows are much less important in \nthe high-income profiles. In 2000 for DMCs, net transfers accounted for almost 70% of \nconsumption net of labor income; asset-based flows accounted for about 30%. Again \nasset-based flows will decline relative to other sources of support for the elderly as \npopulations age, but the changes are relatively small for the high-income profiles. \nTable 6 reports assets relative to labor income required to meet the life cycle needs of the \nelderly in the coming decades. A surprising aspect of the results is that the assets under \nthe high-income profiles are less than the assets for the low-income profiles. In short this \noccurs because the high consumption and lower labor income in the high-income profile \ncountries is more than offset by the high net transfers received by the elderly. Hence, \nhigher consumption net of labor income would be supported with lower levels of assets \nbut with higher levels of transfer wealth.

One is that the growth in assets \nrelative to labor income will accelerate economic growth through capital deepening to the \nextent that greater demand for pension assets in the Asia and Pacific region\u2019s economies \nresults in greater investment in the region. Capital deepening in turn leads to higher \nlabor productivity, higher wages, and higher GDP per worker. The simplest case is the \nconstant-returns-to-scale, neoclassical growth model in which capital and labor determine \nGDP. In this case, growth in capital relative to labor income yields growth in output per \nworker equal to \u03b1/1\u2212\u03b1 where \u03b1 is the elasticity of output with respect to capital. Using \na typical value for \u03b1 of one third, a 1% increase in the ratio of capital relative to labor \nincome leads to a 0.5% increase in output per worker. The impact on output per worker \nof increased pension assets is readily assessed.\nThe rates of growth of pension assets are quite insensitive to whether the high- or low-\nincome profile is employed, hence the discussion is limited to the low-income profiles \n(Table 7). Growth in the ratio of pension assets to labor income is particularly rapid \nin East Asia and Southeast Asia from 2010 to 2030 at 2.9% and 2.6% per annum, \nrespectively.

Again, applying our very simple rule, this \nwould produce growth in output per worker equal to about 1% per annum. The capital \ndeepening effects dominate the effects of the declining support ratio on output per capita \nshown in Table 2. \nC.   Pension Assets\nRapid growth in the populations currently retired and near retirement will lead to rapid \ngrowth in pension assets depending on a variety of factors: the rate of economic growth, \nchanges in age patterns of consumption and labor income, and changes in transfer \nsystems. The results presented here are based on simple assumptions and are intended \nonly to illustrate the connections between demographic factors and assets required to \nsupport retirement. We have assumed that GDP growth is equal to the rate of growth of \nthe effective labor force plus 3% per year and that labor income is 65% of GDP. Initial \nGDP estimates are taken from Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific (ADB, various \nyears), and for this purpose we have used purchasing power parity estimates of GDP for \nthe most recently available year, i.e., 2008 or 2009. Pension assets were calculated using \nthe projected values of total labor income for each economy and the ratio of pension \nassets to labor income summarized in Table 6 and reported in detail in Appendix Tables \n6 and 7. The results are summarized in Figure 8, which shows total pension assets by \nregion at 10-year intervals from 2010 to 2050.

Pension assets are heavily concentrated in East Asia. For 2010, \npension assets for East Asian DMCs and for non-DMCs are at $11 trillion and $12 \ntrillion respectively, and by 2050, pension assets for East Asian DMCs will be $69 trillion \ncompared with $35 trillion for non-DMCs. \nPension assets are similar for South and Southeast Asia. In 2010, total pension assets \nfor both regions were between $2 and $3 trillion, but by 2050 they will reach $29 trillion \nin South Asia and $18 trillion in Southeast Asia. In Central and West Asia total pension \nassets will grow from $0.5 trillion in 2010 to $6.3 trillion in 2050. For Pacific island \nnations, the change over the 40-year period will be from $10 billion in 2010 to $149 billion \nin 2050. \nWe cannot overemphasize the illustrative nature of these results and the importance of \nfocusing on the broad patterns, i.e., the substantial increase in pension assets and the \nshifting regional patterns. First, there is a great deal of uncertainty about how rapidly GDP \nwill grow over the next 40 years. Second, we have used age profiles of consumption \nand labor income from low-income countries where labor income is relatively high \nand consumption is relatively low in old age. There is certainly reason to believe that \nconsumption at older ages will rise more rapidly than assumed here primarily because of \nincreased spending on health care. ", "26 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 280\nThere are two other important complexities to consider. First is the likely change in \nlabor income at older ages. As an empirical matter, labor income at older ages is less \nimportant relative to labor earned during the prime working ages in high-income countries. \nMoreover, relative labor income at older ages has declined very substantially over time in \nthe few economies for which time series estimates are available. If this trend continues, \npension assets will grow more rapidly. Public policy, however, is likely to push in the \nopposite direction as countries raise the pensionable and mandatory retirement ages, \nreform pension and tax systems to increase incentives to work longer, and reduce the \ngenerosity of transfer systems to the elderly. These changes all have the common goal \nof raising labor income at older ages and may partially or completely offset the decline in \nlabor income that would otherwise occur. \nThe second important issue is the likely direction of net transfers to the elderly. The \nelderly in low-income Asia rely to a relatively modest degree on net transfers including \nfamilial transfers. As economies develop, public transfer systems have become more \nimportant, and familial transfers have become less important. Apparently the increase in \npublic transfers has substantially exceeded the decline in familial transfers judging from \nthe importance of net transfers as a share of consumption in high-income economies \nlike Japan; the Republic of Korea; and Taipei,China. As DMCs develop, they will almost \nsurely place more emphasis on public pensions, health care systems, and other social \nprotection programs, but it also seems likely, given greater awareness of aging issues, \nthat these programs may be more modest than those in place in high-income countries \nin Asia or elsewhere. Another possibility is that programs may rely more on funded \napproaches such as those that figure prominently in Singapore. If this proves to be the \ncase, then the pension assets required to maintain standards of living among the elderly \ncould be substantially greater than those shown in Figure 8.\nAccumulating pension assets requires life cycle savings,6 i.e., the combined public and \nprivate savings necessary to support old-age consumption given current age-specific \npatterns of labor income, consumption, and net public and private transfers. Table 8 \nreports gross life cycle savings as a percentage of GDP. Life cycle savings follows \ndirectly from the assumptions made to calculate pension assets and will be sensitive to \nvariations in those assumptions. One additional assumption is that the depreciation rate \nis 5%. To the extent that pension assets actually exceed those shown above, life cycle \nsavings rates also will be higher. \n6  Another possibility would be to redirect assets accumulated for some other purpose to life cycle needs.

The \nhighest rates are found in the oldest economies and regions\u2014Southeast Asia, East Asia, \nand especially the non-DMCs. In East Asia, the gross savings rate will increase from 12% \nto 15% of GDP over the next 4 decades; for the non-DMCs, the increase will be from \nabout 18% to 21%. \nA substantial part of the increase in gross savings rates occurs because the capital\u2013\noutput ratio increases with population aging. Consequently, depreciation as a share of \nGDP  rises and gross savings must increase in order to maintain high capital\u2013output \nratios. The trend in net savings (not shown) is more varied. For most regions, net savings \nis higher in 2040\u20132050 than in 2010\u20132020, but in East Asia the net savings rates declines \nfrom 11% of labor income from 2010 to 2030 to 8.5% from 2040 to 2050. In Southeast \nAsia, net savings as a share of labor income is relatively constant at slightly more than \n9%. Among the non-DMCs, net savings will decline modestly from 2010 to 2050, but \nduring the final decade will be 10% of labor income. Simple generalizations about the \nrelationship between net savings and aging should, however, be made with caution. \nThe results do not support the view that the large swings in savings in many Asian \ncountries can be explained by the effects of demographic factors on life cycle savings. \nThe difference in gross savings rates for 2010 to 2020 varies from a low of 6% to a high \nof 17.6%. Much higher rates of savings are found in many East Asian economies. The \nresults also do not support the view that population aging will lead to substantially lower \nsavings rates. As populations age, however, age-specific savings rates must increase \nin order to generate the higher life cycle wealth required to fund longer periods of \nretirement. Changes in the age composition of the population tend to offset the effect of \nthe higher age-specific values to some extent. Life cycle savings will eventually plateau \nand decline modestly, but aggregate pension assets will rise as populations age.7  \n7  Related empirical literature argues that savings rates are not as low among the elderly as is widely believed. These \npatterns are influenced by both life cycle savings and nonlife cycle savings. For example, to the extent that the \nelderly continue to save in old age because they are risk averse or because they want to leave bequests, aging \nmay not lead to lower savings rates. ", "28 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 280\nVIII.  Human Capital\nThe important connection between population aging and human capital may not be \nimmediately apparent to those who do not understand why population aging is occurring. \nAs previously explained, the most important proximate cause of population aging is \nfertility decline. Aging is especially rapid in East Asia because fertility has declined to \nsuch low levels in Japan; Republic of Korea; and Taipei,China. There are certainly some \nindications that the PRC will follow a similar path with very low fertility already taking hold \nin many of the most economically advanced provinces. This point is important because of \nthe quantity\u2013quality tradeoff. This idea was first introduced by Gary Becker with important \ncontributions by others studying the economics of fertility (Becker and Lewis 1973, Willis \n1973). The idea is that with economic development, parents opt for children of \u201chigher \nquality.\u201d As incomes rise, fertility declines and spending per child rises. To the extent \nthat the higher spending is human capital spending, couples will have fewer children, \nbut those children will be more productive during their working years. At the aggregate \nlevel, entering cohorts of workers will be fewer in number, but they will be healthier, more \neducated, and hence more productive. \nThe quantity\u2013quality tradeoff described by Becker, Lewis, and Willis refers to private \ndecision making by parents about their own children, but a similar phenomenon may \ncharacterize public spending on human capital. Several mechanisms could account \nfor a tradeoff. One possibility is that as the number of children declines, public budget \nconstraints ease and spending per child on education and health rise. Governments \nmay also choose to invest more in children as a mechanism for maintaining growth in \ntax revenues in the face of lower fertility, possibly in anticipation of increased needs for \nsupport for pensions and public health care systems. This idea is consistent with the \nhypothesis advanced by Becker and Murphy that the increase in transfers to the elderly \nthrough pensions was a return on the public investment made in the education of children \n(Becker and Murphy 1988, Bommier et al. 2010).\nTwo issues are important here. The first is the return on investment in human capital. \nOnly if that investment actually leads to higher productivity during the working years will \nspending more per child be a successful alternative to having more children. The returns \non education have been studied very extensively and a broad consensus has been \nreached that the rates are high. There is probably less agreement about the rates of \nreturn on investments in health. This literature is reviewed in Lee and Mason (2010). \nThe second issue is the strength of the tradeoff between quantity and quality. This point \nhas been addressed in a number of recent studies using NTA estimates of spending \non the health and education of children. NTA provide average health and education \nconsumption by single year of age through the public and private sectors. A human \ncapital measure has been constructed by summing the single-year-of-age estimates for \nhealth from age 0 to 17 and for education from age 0 to 26. Age 26 for education was ", "Population, Wealth, and Economic Growth in the Asia and Pacific Region | 29\nselected to include spending on college education, and age 17 was chosen for health to \nexclude most spending related to child bearing. The tradeoff has been estimated using \nboth cross-section data and times series data (Ogawa et al. 2009, Lee and Mason 2010). \nThe estimated elasticity in the cross-sectional data is \u20130.68 for all NTA economies, \u20130.95 \nfor Asian NTA economies, and elasticities greater than \u20131 based on time series estimates \nfor Japan and Taipei,China. The decline in fertility has resulted in smaller cohorts, but \nthose cohorts have substantially greater human capital investment. In Asia, the total value \nof human capital may have held steady or may have actually increased.\nTo what extent can the quantity\u2013quality tradeoff mitigate the effects of low fertility and the \nassociated aging of populations?  Simulations based on an elasticity of \u20131.0 and standard \nestimates of the return on human capital indicate that increased human capital can \nentirely offset declines in fertility (Lee and Mason 2010).\nIX.  Policy Implications and Conclusions \nThe following are some of the key points that should be considered in thinking about \npopulation aging.\nFirst, throughout this paper we have taken population aging as a given which in a sense \nreflects its near inevitability. Life expectancy has been increasing with regularity in \nalmost all DMCs, and this phenomenon is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. \nCertainly improving health and reducing mortality are important development goals, and \npopulation aging is, in part, a consequence of meeting those goals. Immigration can have \nsome influence on population aging, but for the most part immigration policies will not \nbe decisive because the entire region is aging, many DMCs are enormous and are not \nlikely to be greatly affected by reforms in immigration policies, and many have not been \nreceptive to substantial increases in their immigrant populations.\nFertility is the key demographic factor from a policy perspective because changes in \nfertility rates have a large impact on population aging and because low-income countries \nare open to pro-natalist policies. There are, however, some important issues about fertility, \ne.g., what kinds of policies are likely to be effective and how much should be invested \nby governments, nongovernment organizations, and the private sector. For the PRC, the \npressing issue is the speed with which it abandons the one-child policy.\nSecond, the economic effects of population aging depend on features of the economic \nlife cycle. The effects will be particularly pronounced if older adults continue to contribute \nlittle to GDP through their labor. In many countries, public policies create roadblocks that \nreduce the productivity of older workers or push them out of the labor force all together. \nThese roadblocks come in a variety of forms, e.g., mandatory retirement ages, tax codes ", "30 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 280\nthat undermine work incentives, and pension rules that do the same. Most thinking about \nproductivity at older ages focuses on retirement decisions, but often labor income is \nlow at older ages because of low wages. A priority is to understand why wages of older \nworkers are so low and whether improved employment practices could lead to a more \nproductive older workforce.\nThe economic pressures from aging also arise because of the high levels of spending \non the older elderly in many older, high-income economies. Consumption is high at old \nage because of high levels of spending on health care. To a great extent, this spending \nis funded by public transfer systems. A likely prospect and perhaps even a preferred \noutcome is that spending on health care should rise as countries can afford to spend \nmore on it. While spending on health may be highly valued, there are nonetheless many \nimportant issues about health care financing and whether it leads to inefficient systems \nand unnecessarily high costs.\nThird, most DMCs have not established extensive public transfer systems that target \nthe needs of the elderly. As standards of living rise and the administrative capacities of \ngovernments improve, they will surely wish to develop more extensive systems of social \ninsurance, The DMCs are, however, in advantageous positions because they have not yet \nmade extensive commitments that will be unsustainable in the future as their populations \nage.\nThe only alternative to ratcheting up transfer systems is to increase the accumulation of \nassets. Accumulating assets does, however, raise a whole host of issues:  the respective \nroles of the private and public sectors, consumer education, financial regulation, and the \ninvestment environment. Success will depend on (i) individuals accumulating enough to \nprovide for their needs in old age whether voluntarily or through mandates; (ii) a financial \nsystem that is secure and efficient; and (iii) an investment environment that will yield \nadequate returns without undue risk.\nThe fourth major issue has to do with successful investments in human capital. The \nevidence is quite strong that low fertility is leading to high human capital investment, and \npast experience is promising about the returns on investments in education. An important \nissue, however, is whether the very high levels of investment we see in very low fertility \neconomies will yield strong returns.

However, over the decades, growth in the oldest age groups could serve as a \nserious drag on economic growth. Given appropriate development policies, however, \npopulation aging can lead to increased capital, greater investment in education and \nhealth, and continued economic growth. \nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its \ndeveloping member countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their \npeople. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the \nworld\u2019s poor: 1.8 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million \nstruggling on less than $1.25 a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through \ninclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional \nintegration. \n  Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its \nmain instruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, \nequity investments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/economics\nISSN: 1655-5252\nPublication Stock No. WPS124254\nOctober 2011\n< 0124 2546 >\nPrinted on recycled paper Printed in the Philippines"], "metadata": {"Author": "Andrew Mason and Sang-Hyop Lee", "CreationDate": "D:20120118142509+08'00'", "Creator": "Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)", "Keywords": "aging, demographic transition, economic growth, asia, capital, wealth, saving, human capital, population, economic life cycle, transfer systems, pensions, economics working paper no. 280", "ModDate": "D:20130904193132+08'00'", "Producer": "Adobe PDF Library 9.9", "Subject": "This paper shows how changes in population age structure have been favorable to improved living standards throughout developing Asia during recent decades.", "Title": "Population, Wealth, and Economic Growth in the Asia and Pacific Region (No. 280)", "Trapped": "False"}}
