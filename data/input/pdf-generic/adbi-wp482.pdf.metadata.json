In  recent  years,  the  authorities  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  have \nmade  efforts  to  internationalize  its  currency  through  a  two-track  strategy:  promotion  of  the \nuse of the renminbi in the settlement of cross-border trade and investment, and liberalization \nof the capital account. We find that if we use only the quantitative measures of the economy, \nthe  predicted  share  of  the  renminbi  in  global  reserves  could  reach  12%.  However,  if \ninstitutional  and  market variables  are  included,  the  predicted  share  comes  down  to  around \n2%,  which  is  a  more  realistic  prediction.  By  reviewing  experiences  of  other  reserve \ncurrencies,  we  propose  a  three-factor  approach  for  the  PRC  authorities  to  promote  the \ninternational  role  of  the  renminbi:  (i)  increasing  the  opportunities  of  using  renminbi  in  the \ninternational  community,  which  requires  relatively  rapid  growth  of  the  PRC  economy  and \ncontinuous liberalization of trade and investment; (ii) improving the ease of using renminbi, \nwhich requires depth, sophistication, and liquidity of financial markets; and (iii) strengthening \nconfidence  of  using  renminbi,  which  requires  more  transparent  monetary  policy  making,  a \nmore independent legal system, and some political reforms. In general, we believe that the \nrenminbi\u2019s international role should increase in the coming years, but it will take a relatively \nlong period before it plays the role of a global reserve currency. \n \nJEL Classification: F30, F33, F36, F42 \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 482  \n\n                                               Huang, Wang, and Fan \n\nContents \n\n2.1 \n2.2 \n2.3 \n\n3.1 \n3.2 \n3.3 \n\n4.1 \n4.2 \n4.3 \n\nIntroduction ................................................................................................................ 3 \n\nWhat Has Been Achieved? ........................................................................................ 3 \n\nPublic Sector and Private Sector Uses ........................................................... 4 \nIs the Renminbi Already a De Facto Anchor for Regional Currencies? ........... 7 \nSummary ....................................................................................................... 9 \n\n3. \n\nWhat Are the Main Obstacles? .................................................................................. 9 \n\nBrief Review of International Experiences ...................................................... 9 \nDeterminants of Currency Shares in Global Reserves ................................. 12 \nSummary ..................................................................................................... 16 \n\n4. \n\nWhat Needs to Be Done? ........................................................................................ 17 \n\nEconomic Weights ....................................................................................... 18 \nOpenness and Depth of Financial Markets................................................... 20 \nCredibility of Economic and Legal Systems.................................................. 22 \n\nWhat Are the Likely Implications? ............................................................................ 23 \n\nSummary of the Main Findings ................................................................................ 24 \n\nAppendix ............................................................................................................................. 27 \n\nReferences ......................................................................................................................... 28 \n\n \n1. \n\n2. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 482 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Huang, Wang, and Fan \n\n1. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nAround mid-2008 at the height of the global financial crisis, the People\u2019s Bank of China \n(PBC)  made  two  important  decisions  with  regard  to  its  currency  policy:  one  was  to \nsignificantly narrow the trading band of the renminbi\u2013US dollar exchange rate and the \nother was to promote the international use of the renminbi (RMB) in trade settlement, \nespecially trade with neighboring economies. The former was similar to what the PBC \ndid  during  the  Asian  financial  crisis  to  stabilize  investors\u2019  currency  expectations.  The \nlatter, however, was likely motivated by the ambition to make the RMB an international \ncurrency.  \n\nMany  policy  makers  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  believe  that  the \ninternational  monetary  system  dominated  by  a  national  currency,  the  US  dollar,  is \nlogically  inconsistent  and  unsustainable.  The  outbreak  of  the  subprime  crisis  in  the \nUnited  States  (US)  was  evidence  of  the  problem.  A  possible  long-term  solution  is  to \ncreate  a  supranational  currency,  such  as  a  revamped  special  drawing  right  (SDR)  of \nthe  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  (see,  e.g.,  Zhou  2009).  In  the  short  run, \nhowever,  the  subprime  crisis  could  lead  to  weakening  demand  for  the  US  dollar  and \ncreate room for the RMB to play some kind of international role. \n\nWhile  policies  to  internationalize  the  RMB  picked  up  pace  in  late  2008,  the  PBC\u2019s \nplanning of this effort started much earlier. In 2006, a study group of the central bank \npublished an article titled \u201cThe Timing, Path and Strategies of RMB Internationalization,\u201d \nin  which  it  argued  that  \u201cthe  time  has  come  for  promotion  of  the  internationalization  of \nthe  RMB\u201d  (PBC  Study  Group  2006).  The  study  group  also  suggested \nthat \ninternationalization  of  the  RMB  could  enhance  the  PRC\u2019s  international  status  and \ncompetitiveness and would increase the country\u2019s influence in the world economy. \n\nThe  PRC\u2019s  strategy  of  RMB  internationalization  is  sometimes  characterized  as  a  two-\ntrack approach (Subacchi 2010). The first track aims at increasing the international use \nof  the  currency,  starting  with  regional  use  for  trade  and  investment  settlement  and \nestablishment  of  the  offshore  currency  market  in  Hong  Kong,  China.  And  the  second \ntrack  tackles  the  capital  account  convertibility  issue,  allowing  greater  cross-border \ncapital  mobility,  encouraging  holding  of  RMB  assets  by  nonresidents,  and  providing \ninstruments for  hedging currency  risks. In  the  past  5  years,  the  PRC  authorities  have \nmade significant progress in all these areas and will likely move ahead more rapidly in \nthe coming years. \n\nWill the RMB likely become a global reserve currency? This is the central question we \nattempt to address in this paper. To shed light on this subject, we tackle four specific \nissues  in  turn.  First,  what  has  the  PRC  accomplished  so  far  in  terms  of  RMB \ninternationalization?  Second,  what  are  the  main  obstacles  for  it  to  become  an \ninternational reserve currency? Third, what can the PRC authorities do to promote the \ninternational role of its currency? And finally, what are the implications for the PRC and \nthe  world  if the  RMB  becomes  a  reserve  currency?  In  the  remainder  of the  paper  we \naddress these questions in turn and draw together the main findings of the study in the \nfinal section. \n\n2.  WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED? \n\nChinn  and  Frankel  (2005)  provide  a  good  analytical  framework  for  organizing  the \nPRC\u2019s  policy  efforts  in  internationalizing  its  currency  (Table  1).  An  international \ncurrency  should  possess  three  important  cross-border  functions:  store  of  value, \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 482 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Huang, Wang, and Fan \n\nmedium  of  exchange,  and  unit  of  account.  Each  of  these  functions  may  be  further \ndecomposed  into  public and  private  purposes. While  Gao  and  Yu (2012) confirm  that \nnonresidents have started using the RMB as a vehicle currency in trade and financial \nsettlement,  Li  and  Liu  (2008)  sketch  a  promising  future  for  it  to  serve  as  a  reserve \ncurrency.  \n\nTable 1: International Use of the Renminbi \n\nFunction \n\nStore of Value \n\nPurpose \n\nDate \n\nJul 2012 \n\nInternational reserves \n(public) \n\nEvent \n\nIndonesia\u2019s central bank was allowed to invest \nin the People\u2019s Republic of China interbank \nbond market \n\nApr 2013  Reserve Bank of Australia plans to invest 5% \nof its foreign reserves in renminbi \n\nDec 2002  Provisional Measures on Administration of \n\nDomestic Securities Investments of Qualified \nForeign Institutional Investors \nFeb 2004  Banks in Hong Kong, China were allowed to \nopen renminbi deposit accounts \nFirst renminbi-denominated bond was issued \n\nJun 2007 \n\nDec 2012  Qianhai cross-border renminbi loan rules were \n\npublished by the People\u2019s Bank of China \n\nCurrency substitution \n(private) \n\nMedium of \nExchange \n\nVehicle currency \n(public) \n\nN/A \n\nN/A \n\nInvoicing currency \n(private) \n\nJul 2009 \n\nPilot program for renminbi settlement of cross-\nborder trade transactions \n\nJan 2011  Domestic enterprises were allowed to invest \n\nrenminbi overseas \n\nAug 2011  Cross-border trade settlement in renminbi was \n\nextended to the whole country \n\nUnit of Account \n\nAnchor for pegging \n(public) \n\nDenominating currency \n(private) \n\nN/A \n\nN/A \n\nN/A \n\nN/A \n\nSource: Chinn and Frankel (2005), updated by authors. \n\n2.1  Public Sector and Private Sector Uses \n\nDue  to  the  long-existed  legal  and  administrative  barriers,  the  PRC\u2019s  capital  market \nfeatures  apparent  segmentation.  The  nonequivalence  of  the  offshore  currency  (CNH) \nmarket with the official or onshore currency (CNY) generates non-negligible benefits for \nforeign investment: while offshore equivalent instruments whose payoff is equivalent in \nmost, if not all, states of the world, investing in the onshore market could yield returns \nas much as 100\u2013150 basis points higher than the global benchmark (Maziad and Kang \n2012).  As  a  result,  RMB-denominated  assets  greatly  appeal  to  foreign  central  banks \nthat  seek  high  yield  yet  safe  investment  to  diversify  their  asset  portfolio.  In  2010,  the \nPRC  began  allowing  foreign  central  banks  to  directly  invest  in  its  domestic  interbank \nbond  market  without  going  through  the  Qualified  Foreign  Institutional  Investor  (QFII) \nprogram,  which  allows  foreign  investors  to  buy  onshore  stocks  and  bonds  under  a \nquota  system.  On  23  July  2012,  Bank  Indonesia  and  the  PBC  announced  they  had \nreached  an  agreement  allowing  the  Indonesian  central  bank  to  invest  in  the  PRC \ninterbank bond market. \n\nClearly, foreign central banks\u2019 interest in the PRC bond market is driven at least by two \nconsiderations.  One,  as  most  central  banks  with  large  foreign  exchange  reserves \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 482 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Huang, Wang, and Fan \n\nstruggle  with  the  only  major  option  of  investing  in  the  US  treasury  market,  the  PRC \nbond  market  offers  a  useful  option for  diversification. This makes  sense especially  as \nthe PRC is on the way to becoming a dominant economic power in the world. And two, \nthe PRC bond market offers somewhat higher yields, compared with similar markets in \nthe  developed  world.  It  is  also  helped  by  the  expectation  that  the  onshore  currency \nmarket could show a longer-term trend of appreciation. \n\nIn  terms  of  functioning  as  a  medium  of  exchange,  the  PRC  started  signing  currency \nswap agreements with other countries under the framework of the Chiang Mai Initiative \n(CMI)  following  the  Asian  financial  crisis.  The  purpose  of  such  agreements  is  to \nimprove  future  financial  stability  by  functioning  as  an  alternative  to  the  individually \naccumulated  foreign  exchange  reserves,  and  to  promote  trade  and  investment  with \nthese  countries.  As  a  result  of  the  PRC\u2019s  involvement  in  the  buildup  of  the  regional \nfinancial architecture, the RMB is used as a vehicle currency via the swap agreements \nand as a denominating currency in the issuance of Asian bonds under the Asian Bond \nFund II scheme.  \n\nThe  PBC  has  subsequently  also  signed  other  currency  swap  agreements  beyond  the \nCMI  framework.  For  instance,  in  December  2008,  the  PRC  signed  its  first  swap \nagreement  with  the  Republic  of  Korea.  This  was  a  serious  move  by  the  PRC  in \nresponse  to  the  widespread  financial  crisis.  Since  then,  the  PRC  has  signed  swap \nagreements  with  central  banks  of  19  economies.  The  latest  was  signed  between  the \nPBC  and  the  Bank  of  England  in  late  June  2013  for  a  total  of  200  billion  yuan.  It  is \npossible  that  France  may  also  follow  the  United  Kingdom  (UK)  to  sign  such  an \nagreement  with  the  PRC.  According  to  our  count,  the  total  value  of  currency  swap \nagreements is more than 2.2 trillion yuan. \n\nTable 2: Bilateral Swap Agreements Signed since 2008 \n\n \n\nDate \n\n \n\nDate \n\nAmount  \n(yuan \nbillion) \n\nRepublic of Korea \n\nHong Kong, \n\nChina \n\nMalaysia \n\nBelarus \nIndonesia \nArgentina \nIceland \nSingapore \n\nNew Zealand \n\n12 Dec 2008 \n26 Oct 2011 \n20 Jan 2009 \n22 Nov 2011 \n8 Feb 2009 \n8 Feb 2012 \n11 Mar 2009 \n23 Mar 2009 \n2 Apr 2009 \n9 Jun 2010 \n23 Jul 2010 \n7 Mar 2013 \n18 Apr 2011 \n\n180 \n360 \n200 \n400 \n80 \n180 \n20 \n100 \n70 \n3.5 \n150 \n300 \n25 \n\nUzbekistan \nMongolia \n\nKazakhstan \nThailand \nPakistan \nUnited Arab Emirates \nTurkey \nAustralia \nUkraine \nBrazil \nUnited Kingdom \n\nTotal \n\n19 Apr 2011 \n6 May 2011 \n20 Mar 2012 \n13 Jun 2011 \n22 Dec 2011 \n23 Dec 2011 \n17 Jan 2012 \n21 Feb 2012 \n22 Mar 2012 \n26 Jun 2012 \n26 Mar 2013 \n22 Jun 2013 \n \n\nAmount  \n(yuan \nbillion) \n\n0.7 \n5 \n10 \n7 \n70 \n10 \n35 \n10 \n200 \n15 \n190 \n200 \n\n2,206 \n\nSource: People\u2019s Bank of China.  \n\n \n\nAt the private level, the authorities took various steps to use the RMB for settlement of \ninternational  trade  and  investment  in  order  to  partially  replace  traditional  invoicing \ncurrencies such as the US dollar and yen. In July 2009, the PBC and other government \ndepartments introduced the first pilot program of using RMB in the settlement of cross-\nborder  trade.  This  program  aims  at  facilitating  trade  and  investment  for  67,000 \nenterprises  in  16  provinces.  Two  years  later  in  August  2011,  the  authorities  issued  a \nnotice  extending  the  geographical  coverage  of  RMB  trade  settlement  to  the  whole \ncountry.  The  PBC  issued  the  Administrative  Rules  on  RMB-denominated  Foreign \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 482 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Huang, Wang, and Fan \n\nDirect  Investment  in  October  2011  and  announced  in  June  2012  that  all  PRC \ncompanies with an import/export license can use RMB to settle cross-border trade.  \n\nRMB settlement has grown very rapidly during the past years. According to PBC data, \ninternational  trade  and foreign  direct  investment  settled  in  RMB  amounted  to  1  trillion \nyuan  (US$161  billion)  and  85.4  billion  yuan  (US$13.7  billion),  respectively,  during  the \nfirst  quarter  of  2013. 1  One  caveat  needs  to  be  made,  which  is  that  while  RMB \nsettlement has increased exponentially, most cross-border activities are still invoiced in \nother hard currencies such as US dollars. Therefore, the RMB is not yet being used as \na true international currency. \n\nThe development of the offshore currency market in Hong Kong, China made a unique \ncontribution  in  encouraging  private  nonresident  holding  of  RMB.  The  offshore  market \noffers a useful laboratory for strengthening RMB outbound circulation and appealing to \nnonresident investors. As early as 2004, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched \nthe RMB Business Scheme, allowing banks in Hong Kong, China to open RMB deposit \naccounts  for  individuals  and  some  enterprises.  However,  the  offshore  deposit  market \ndid  not really  take  off until  mid-2010  when  new  rules  were  issued  to  relax  restrictions \non  RMB  activities  of  banks  in  Hong  Kong,  China.  By  March  2013,  the  total  value  of \nCNH  deposits  had  reached  668  billion  yuan  (US$107  billion),  almost  745  times  the \nvalue of when the market was first established in February 2004 (Figure 1). In addition, \nthe  number  of  institutions  engaging  in  RMB  business  has  increased  to  140  from  the \noriginal 32, quadrupling within less than 10 years. \n\nFigure 1: Renminbi Deposits in Hong Kong, China Offshore Markets, 2004\u20132013 \n\nNo. of institutions engaged in renminbi business (left axis)\n\nRenminbi deposits (billion yuan, right axis)\n\n160\n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n800\n\n700\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\nFeb-04\n\nAug-05\n\nFeb-07\n\nAug-08\n\nFeb-10\n\nAug-11\n\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority.  \n\n0\nFeb-13\n\n \n\nDevelopment  of  an  offshore  market  for  RMB-denominated  bonds  began  in  mid-2007, \nwhen  selected  mainland  banks  were  permitted  for  the  first  time  to  raise  funds  by \nissuing such bonds in Hong Kong, China. The China Development Bank was the first to \nissue  RMB-denominated  bonds  in  Hong  Kong,  China  in  July  2007,  while  the  China \nConstruction  Bank  became  the  first  PRC  bank  to  issue  them  in  London  (outside  of \nHong Kong, China) in November 2012. \n\n                                                \n1\n See \n\nhttp://www.pbc.gov.cn/publish/english/955/2013/20130417083528793671703/20130417083528793671\n703_.html \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 482 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Huang, Wang, and Fan \n\nIn  2010,  bond  issuance  permission  was  extended  to  nonfinancial  firms  and  foreign \nmultinationals doing business in the PRC. McDonald\u2019s, the well-known fast food chain \nstore, and Caterpillar, the US-based maker of construction equipment, were among the \nfirst group of foreign companies to tap into the \u201cdim sum\u201d bond market. HSBC became \nthe first non-Hong Kong, China institution to issue RMB bonds in London in April 2012. \nDespite  its  short  history,  the  size  of  the  offshore  bond  market  has  expanded  rapidly \nsince  2012,  with  continuous  relaxation  of  restrictions  imposed  by  PRC  regulators  and \nstrong expectations of RMB appreciation. \n\nSome foreign central banks have started to hold RMB as part of their foreign reserves, \nas  the  international  significance  of  the  currency  increases  rapidly.  This  activity, \nhowever,  remains  primitive,  mainly  because  the  currency  is  not  yet  convertible  under \nthe  capital  account  and  internationally  available  RMB-denominated  assets  remain \nscarce.  One  recent  significant  step  was  in  June  2013  when  the  Reserve  Bank  of \nAustralia  decided  to  invest  up  to  5%  of  its  foreign  reserves  in  RMB,  which  should  be \nequivalent to A$2 billion according to the bank\u2019s current size of foreign reserves. \n\n2.2  Is the Renminbi Already a De Facto Anchor for Regional \n\nCurrencies? \n\nEconomists have long argued that there are some fundamental factors driving implicit \nor explicit regional currency arrangements in Asia (Kawai 2002). The US dollar has in \nthe past been the most significant anchor currency for the region, although in the last \ndecade  of  the  20th  century  the  yen  also  played  an  important  role  for  some  regional \ncurrencies  such  as  the  won  and  the  NT  dollar.  Given  the  PRC\u2019s  capital  account \ncontrols  and  inflexibility  of  the  RMB  exchange  rate,  there  is  not  yet  an  explicit \narrangement  linking  foreign  exchange  rates  to  the  RMB.  However,  Ito  (2008) \nsuggested that, implicitly, the RMB was probably already serving as one of the anchors \nfor regional currencies. \n\nTo  assess  this  possibility,  especially  with  respect  to  changes  over  time,  we  conduct \nsome  statistical  analyses  by  applying  the  framework  of  Frankel  and  Wei  (1994). \nSpecifically, the following model is estimated: \n\n \n\nOn  the  left  is  the  dependent  variable,  which  is  the  daily  return  of  exchange  rates  of \n\u2206\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc66/\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc45 = \ud835\udefc0 + \ud835\udefc1\u2206\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37/\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc45 + \ud835\udefc2\u2206\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc45/\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc45 + \ud835\udefc3\u2206\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc4c/\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc45 + \ud835\udefc4\u2206\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc4c/\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc45.\nAsian economies. At the same time, the daily return of the US dollar, the euro, the yen, \nand the RMB are placed on the right side of the equation as explanatory variables. All \nthe  exchange  rates  are  expressed  relative  to  the  IMF\u2019s  SDR,  as  suggested  by \nFratzscher  and  Mehl  (2011).  Moreover,  to  ensure  that  all  the  factors  are  exogenous \nand  circumvent  the  potential  multi-collinearity  arising  from  the  fact  that  the  RMB  is  to \nsome extent pegged to the US dollar, the RMB factor is orthogonalized with respect to \nthe US dollar factor by regressing the former on the latter and taking the residuals as \nthe new explanatory factor.2 \n\nAll daily data are drawn from the IMF database for the period between 1 January 1999 \nand  10  June  2013.  In  the  empirical  estimation, we  use  the  date  of the exchange  rate \npolicy reform on 21 July 2005 dividing the whole sample period into two subperiods.  \n\nEstimation  results  using  pre-reform  data  confirm  that  the  exchange  rates  of  all  seven \nAsian  currencies  are  significantly  influenced  by  the  US  dollar  (top  half  of  Table  3). \n\n                                                \n2\n The following empirical findings hold when conducting a similar auxiliary regression on the euro and yen. \n\nThe results are available upon request from the authors.  \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 482 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Huang, Wang, and Fan \n\nAmong  them,  the  Hong  Kong  dollar  and  the  ringgit  are  strict  dollar  pegs.  The  Indian \nrupee, the rupiah, and the won are heavily impacted by the US dollar with a weight of \nmore  than  0.85.  The  US  dollar\u2019s  influence  on  the  Singapore  dollar  and  the  baht, \nhowever,  is  slightly  smaller,  with  a  weight  of  around  0.55\u20130.65.  Influences  of  the  yen \nare noticeably smaller but present in a number of cases, such as the Singapore dollar \nand  the  baht.  The  euro  does  not  have  a  noticeable  effect  and  the  RMB  asserts  no \nsignificant influence on other Asian currencies. \n\nThe story changed significantly after the July 2005 exchange rate reform (bottom half \nof Table 3). The overall impacts of the US dollar, the yen, and the euro are similar to \nthose  before  July  2005.  Yet,  the  RMB  shows  important  influences  on  its  neighbors\u2019 \ncurrencies. Specifically, while the US dollar seems to dominate in the case of the Hong \nKong dollar, the won, and the baht, the RMB affects the Indian rupee, the rupiah, the \nringgit, and the Singapore dollar more, though this finding is still slightly odd given that \nit  is  not  yet  fully  convertible  and  the  exchange  rate  is  not  yet  freely  floating.  It  is, \nnonetheless, consistent with the fact that Asian central banks pay close attention to the \nmovement of the RMB exchange rate. \n\nTable 3: Asian Currency Regimes with Rise of the Renminbi \n\nIndian \nrupee \n\nWon \n\nRinggit \n\nSingapore \ndollar \n\nBaht \n\nHong \nKong \ndollar \n\nRupiah \n\n \nBefore the Renminbi Reform (1 Jan 1999\u201320 Jul 2005) \nUS dollar \n \nEuro \n \nYen \n \nYuan \n \nConstant \n \n\n0.994*** \n(0.0162) \n0.0103 \n(0.0116) \n0.00996* \n(0.00555) \n0.00555 \n(0.0348) \n\u20134.2E-04 \n(2.74E-04) \n\n0.858*** \n(0.0737) \n0.0309** \n(0.0144) \n0.0150* \n(0.00876) \n0.00139 \n(0.00155) \n5.06E-05 \n(1.18E-04) \n\n0.875*** \n(0.091) \n0.197 \n(0.136) \n0.243*** \n(0.0732) \n1.913 \n(2.111) \n0.00128 \n(1.7E-03) \n\nObservations \nR-squared \n\n1,340 \n0.951 \n\n1,205 \n0.738 \n\n1,089 \n0.131 \n\nAfter the Reform (20 Jul 2005\u201310 Jun 2013) \nUS dollar \n \nEuro \n \nYen \n \nYuan \n \nConstant \n \n\n0.673*** \n(0.0725) \n0.0677 \n(0.0608) \n\u20130.205*** \n(0.0253) \n0.749*** \n(0.163) \n\u20133.18E-04** \n(1.27E-04) \n\n0.966*** \n(0.0106) \n0.00119 \n(0.0072) \n\u20130.00215 \n(0.00359) \n0.0403** \n(0.018) \n\u20134.3E-06 \n(1.63E-05) \n\n0.714*** \n(0.104) \n\u20130.0216 \n(0.0638) \n\u20130.248*** \n(0.0511) \n0.954*** \n(0.177) \n\u20131.7E-04 \n(2.17E-04) \n\nObservations \nR-squared \n\n1,525 \n0.957 \n\n1,382 \n0.186 \n\n1,453 \n0.09 \n\n0.978*** \n(0.235) \n0.0192 \n(0.0388) \n0.0317 \n(0.0232) \n0.144 \n(0.515) \n3.03E-04 \n(4.09E-04) \n\n1,026 \n0.4 \n\n0.919*** \n(0.114) \n\u20130.15 \n(0.117) \n\u20130.0186 \n(0.0623) \n0.526** \n(0.229) \n\u20132.9E-04 \n(1.93E-04) \n\n1,489 \n0.164 \n\n1.000*** \n(0.0002) \n\u20133.83E-05* \n(2.32E-05) \n\u20135.2E-06 \n(1.3E-04) \n0.0066 \n(0.00417) \n5.08E-07 \n(3.28E-07) \n\n1,348 \n0.99 \n\n0.717*** \n(0.0489) \n0.0595 \n(0.0408) \n\u20130.127*** \n(0.018) \n1.227*** \n(0.136) \n\u20135.8E-05 \n(9.20E-05) \n\n1,457 \n0.286 \n\n0.570*** \n(0.0954) \n\u20130.0185 \n(0.0195) \n0.171*** \n(0.0133) \n1.452 \n(2.033) \n0.000133 \n(1.67E-04) \n\n1,286 \n0.502 \n\n0.592*** \n(0.0406) \n0.0792** \n(0.0342) \n\u20130.0593*** \n(0.0151) \n1.185*** \n(0.111) \n1.94E-05 \n(7.51E-05) \n\n1,526 \n0.26 \n\n0.619*** \n(0.177) \n\u20130.0133 \n(0.0354) \n0.164*** \n(0.0231) \n1.244 \n(3.888) \n\u20135.6E-05 \n(3.0E-04) \n\n1,108 \n0.368 \n\n0.836*** \n(0.0369) \n\u20130.0471 \n(0.0301) \n\u20130.00608 \n(0.0149) \n0.444*** \n(0.126) \n2.57E-05 \n(8.24E-05) \n\n1,329 \n0.468 \n\nSource: International Monetary Fund International Financial Statistics, CEIC. \n\nRecently,  however,  Kawai  and  Pontines  (2014)  challenged  the  validity  of  the  above \ntype  of  exercise  by  arguing  that  there  could  be  a  serious  multi-collinearity  problem \nbetween the US dollar and RMB exchange rates (as indicated above, our analyses first \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 482 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Huang, Wang, and Fan \n\ntake  out the  influences of the  US  dollar  exchange rate  on the  RMB  and  then  use the \nresidual  of  the  RMB  exchange  rate  to  estimate  its  influence  on  Asian  currencies).  By \nproposing  and  applying a  new  two-step  estimation  method,  they found  that,  while  the \nRMB\u2019s  influence  was  on  the  rise,  there  was  not  yet  a  RMB  bloc  in  East  Asia  (Kawai \nand Pontines 2014). Therefore, this issue needs to be explored further. \n\n2.3  Summary \n\nTo sum up, within a relatively short period, the PRC authorities have made meaningful \nprogress in internationalizing the country\u2019s currency. The amount of international trade \nand  direct  investment  settled  in  RMB  is  growing  very  rapidly.  RMB  deposits  have \nalready reached a relatively high level in Hong Kong, China and are growing quickly in \nother  markets.  RMB-denominated  assets,  mainly  bonds,  are  already  on  offer  both  in \nHong  Kong,  China  and  London.  In  addition  to  large  volumes  of  currency  swap \nagreements, some foreign central banks have also started holding RMB as part of their \nforeign exchange reserves. The RMB even asserts important influences on exchange \nrates of some other Asian currencies. \n\nAssessing such progress in the framework proposed by Chinn and Frankel (2005), we \nfind  that  RMB  internationalization  has  advanced  most  remarkably  in  its  use  as  a \nmedium of exchange for both the public and private sectors. International functions lag \nmost clearly as a unit of account for the private sector and store of value for the public \nsector.  The  significant  achievements  are  attributable  to  two  important  factors:  one  is \nthe  relative  decline  of  the  US  dollar  following  the  global  financial  crisis  and  therefore \nnew  demand  for  an  alternative  international  currency;  and  the  other  is  the  PRC \ngovernment\u2019s well planned and well executed policies. Some even argue that the main \ndriving force behind the impressive growth of the offshore RMB market is the strongly \nheld  view  that  the  RMB  would  inevitably  and  substantially  appreciate  against  other \nmajor  currencies. \nIn  other  words,  speculative  desire  has  overwhelmed  other \nfundamental  demand,  such  as  risk  hedging,  in  driving  the  growth  of  the  offshore \ncurrency market (Garber 2011). \n\n3.  WHAT ARE THE MAIN OBSTACLES? \n\nDespite  the  progress  the  PRC  authorities  made  in  internationalizing  the  currency,  the \nRMB is not yet an international currency. Is it realistic for it to become an international \ncurrency  in  the  perceivable  future?  Academic  assessment  may  lead  to  very  different \nconclusions.  Some  may  suggest  that  given  the  PRC  is  already  the  world\u2019s  second \nlargest economy and one of the most important global trading partners, it is a matter of \ntime  for  the  RMB  to  ascend  to  international  currency  status.  Meanwhile,  others  may \nargue  that  it  is  very  hard  for  the  international  market  to  accept  the  RMB  as  a  global \ncurrency  due  to  the  PRC\u2019s  primitive  financial  markets,  unique  monetary  policy \nmechanism, capital account controls, and underdeveloped legal system. \n\n3.1  Brief Review of International Experiences \n\nWhat are the main obstacles for the RMB to become an international currency? We try \nto  shed  some  light  on  this  question.  First,  we  take  a  brief  look  at  the  rise  of  the  US \ndollar, the deutsche mark, the yen, and the euro to global reserve currency status and \ndraw  some  simple  lessons.  Second,  we  adopt  some  quantitative  methods  to  identify \nkey  determinants  of  the  shares  of  existing  international  currencies  in  global  currency \nreserves.  The  estimation  results  are  then  applied  to  predict  the  likely  shares  of  the \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 482 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Huang, Wang, and Fan \n\nRMB under different sets of assumptions. One key message appears to be clear and \nconsistent:  size  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and  size  of  trade  are  only  a \nnecessary  condition,  but  quality  of  markets,  policies,  and  institutions  are  by  far  more \nimportant for producing international currencies. \n\nDuring the 20th century, three national currencies rose to international currency status: \nthe  US  dollar  in the first  half  of the  century,  and  the  deutsche mark and  the  yen  over \nthe two decades following the 1971\u20131973 collapse of the Bretton Woods system. The \nfirst decade of the 21st century witnessed the ascendancy of a supranational currency: \nthe euro. By looking at the circumstances in which each of the currencies became an \ninternational  currency,  we  may  be  able  to  draw  some  useful  lessons  for  the \ninternationalization of the RMB. \n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the pound sterling reigned supreme. Although the \nUS  was  already  the  largest  economy  of  the  world,  its  currency  was  still  a  relatively \nunimportant currency in global financial markets. In retrospect, the main reason the US \ndollar did not rule the world economy before World War I was its lack of a deep, liquid, \nand  open  financial  market.  Another  important  reason  was  the  absence  of  a  credible \ncentral  bank,  which  is  often  considered  a  prerequisite  for  development  of  financial \nmarkets  and  financial  instruments  (Frankel  2011).  These  reasons  suggest  that  while \nsize of the economy is an important condition for creating an international currency, it is \nfar from a sufficient condition. \n\nThe  situation  changed  in  1913  when  President  Woodrow  Wilson  ratified  the \nestablishment of the Federal Reserve and the onset of World War I accelerated the US \ndollar\u2019s  rise.  Large-scale  wartime  lending  by  the  US  to  Britain  reversed  the  long-\nestablished  creditor\u2013debtor  relationship,  positioning  the  dollar  as  a  strong  global \ncurrency.  Even  though  the  pound  sterling  made  a  slight  comeback  later  in  the  1930s \nafter  the  Great  Depression,  by  1944  the  dollar  had  sealed  its  crown  position  through \nthe  establishment  of  the  Bretton  Woods  system.  The  new  position  of  the  US  dollar \nrelative  to  the  pound  sterling  was  also  clearly  reflected  in  the  composition  of  foreign-\nowned  liquid  assets  around  that  time.  During  the  past  decade,  the  dollar\u2019s  share  in \ninternational reserves have trended down gradually but stayed above 60% (Figure 2). \n\nFigure 2: Currency Composition of Official Foreign Reserves \n\n30%\n\n25%\n\n20%\n\n15%\n\n10%\n\n5%\n\n0%\n\n80%\n\n70%\n\n60%\n\n50%\n\n40%\n\n30%\n\n20%\n\n10%\n\n0%\n\nEuro\nSwiss franc\nUS dollar (right axis)\n\nYen\nPound sterling\n\n1999-Q1\nSource: International Monetary Fund Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER) \ndatabase. \n\n2011-Q1\n\n2008-Q1\n\n2005-Q1\n\n2002-Q1\n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 482 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Huang, Wang, and Fan \n\nThe  deutsche  mark  was  born  in  Ludwig  Erhard\u2019s  currency  reform  in  1948,  but  its \ncentral bank, the Bundesbank, was not founded until 1957. Despite its short history, the \nmark continued to gain status throughout the 1980s. The main contributor to this was \nthe  growing  size  of  the  German  economy  and  the  impeccable  reputation  that  the \nBundesbank established in keeping the value of the mark strong. In 1989, the deutsche \nmark  saw  its  peak  performance  in  the  international  monetary  system  when  the \ncurrency reached almost 20% of world foreign exchange reserves. Following that peak, \nthe deutsche mark started a long journey of decline due to slowdown of the economy \nand collapse of the Berlin Wall. The Maastricht Treaty signed in 1992 came to fruition \nin January 1999 and the deutsche mark, together with the French franc and nine other \ncontinental currencies, went out of existence in the historic creation of the euro. \n\nThe  story  of  the  rise  of  the  yen  began  as  Japan\u2019s  export-driven  economic  miracle \nallowed  its  currency  to  meet  the  first  criterion  for  internationalization:  the  country\u2019s \neconomic  weight.  After  the  collapse  of  the  Bretton  Woods  system  in  1973,  central \nbanks  around  the  world  began  to  hold  yen  as  a  substitute  foreign  exchange  reserve. \nNevertheless,  since  Japanese  financial  markets  remained  uncompetitive,  highly \nregulated, and mostly closed to foreigners, the actual extent of yen internationalization \nwas  low.  International  use  of  the  yen  accelerated  in  the  late  1980s  and  the  share  of \nworld foreign exchange reserves denominated in yen reached its peak at 9% in 1991. \nSince  the  bursting  of the  real  estate  and  equity bubbles  at  the  start  of the  1990s, the \ncountry slowly yet painfully fell into a long-lasting spiral recession. By the end of 2003, \nit  became  clear  that  any  further  attempt  to  internationalize  the  yen  would  be  futile \nwithout a fundamental change in the economic might of Japan (Takagi 2011). \n \nAt the end of the 20th century, a supranational regional currency came into existence. \nThe  motivation  of  creating  the  euro  was  mainly  political:  it  was  deemed  as  an \nindispensable step toward realizing the ambition of a united Europe. Naturally the euro \nstarted  with  two  advantages:  it  was  the  home  currency  for  a  bloc  that  resembled  the \nUS  in  terms  of  economic  scale  and  it  seemed  likely  to  inherit  the  credibility  of  the \ndeutsche  mark.  As  a  result,  it  advanced  quickly  into  the  ranks  of  the  top  reserve \ncurrencies in its first decade and was expected to pose a challenge to the long global \nsupremacy of the greenback.3 \n \nExperiences  of  the  dollar,  deutsche  mark,  yen,  and  euro  suggest  that  to  assume \ninternational status, a currency needs to be supported by at least three key factors: the \nscale  of  the  economy,  which  leads  to  the  extensiveness  of  the  issuing  country\u2019s \ntransactional networks (Eichengreen 2005); the stability of the currency value, which is \nbelieved  to  be  linked  to  sound  macroeconomic  fundamentals  in  the  issuing  country \n(Chen, Peng, and Shu 2009); and the existence of well-developed and open financial \nmarkets, which guarantees the liquidity and convertibility of the currency (Cohen 2007). \nHowever,  these  may  still  not  be  sufficient.  As  Helleiner  (2008)  suggested,  confidence \nand  power  in  a  currency  may  derive  not  only  from  economic  fundamentals,  but  also \nfrom the social institutions. Further, as Krugman (1984) noted, there is a kind of circular \ncausation  encouraging  a  leading  international  currency  to  become  even  more \nprominent  over  time  since  people  find  benefits  in  using  a  currency  that  is  used  by \nothers. \n\n                                                \n3\n Whether the euro will displace the US dollar as the main international currency is far from unambiguous. \n\nSee Kenen (2002), Chinn and Frankel (2008), and McNamara (2008) for a detailed discussion. \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 482 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Huang, Wang, and Fan \n\n3.2  Determinants of Currency Shares in Global Reserves \n\ninternationalization,  we  apply  a  quantitative \n\nTo verify the above suggestions and illustrate the importance of the various factors for \nthe \nRMB \ndeterminants  of  shares  of  individual  currencies  in  total  global  reserve  holdings,  using \ndata of existing reserve currencies. Potential explanatory variables include scale of the \neconomy,  stability  of  the  currency,  and  development  of  financial  markets  and  social \ninstitutions.  After  estimation  of  the  model  using  data  for  existing  international  reserve \ncurrencies,  we  also  carry  out  a  series  of  counterfactual  exercises  to  identify  some  of \nthe main obstacles for the RMB in becoming a reserve currency. \n\nframework \n\nidentify \n\nto \n\nThere  are  several  studies  in  the  literature  looking  at  the  same  question.  Previous \nmodels, such as those adopted by Chen, Peng, and Shu (2009) and Li and Liu (2008), \nconsidered the three traditional economic fundamentals in determining currency shares \nin  global  foreign  reserve  holdings.  This  is  a  reasonable  exercise  as  they  reveal  the \npotential  that  the  PRC  could  realize  by  looking  at  only  the  three  basic  (quantitative) \nvariables.  However,  Lee  (2010)  showed  that  adding  a  capital  account  liberalization \nindex  to  the  model  could  generate  different  results.  By  adding  policy  and  institutional \nvariables  to  the  model, we  may  be  able  to  see how  restrictive  these  variables  are for \nthe  PRC\u2019s  reserve  currency  ambition.  At  the  same  time,  empirical  results  including \npolicy  and  institutional  variables  may  also  shed  light  on  where  the  authorities  should \ndirect their key reform efforts. \n\nIn  this  study,  we  intend  to  include  a  series  of  potential  determining  variables  for \ncurrency shares in global foreign reserves. We start with the basic model including only \nthe  most  commonly  used  variables,  mostly  quantitative  measures.  We  will  then \nestimate  several  additional  models  by  including  new  variables,  mostly  qualitative  or \ninstitutional  variables.  The  logic  of  doing  this  is  simple:  most  studies  examine  the \nRMB\u2019s potential share in global foreign reserves by looking only at the size of the PRC \neconomy. While this is useful, most economies in the world never reach their potential \nbecause  of  institutional  deficiencies.  For  instance,  the  currency  share  will  not  rise \nalongside  economic  growth  if  the  currency  is  not  convertible.  By  estimating  the \npotentials  with  the  policy  and  institutional  variables,  we  are  able  to  tell  what  is \npractically  achievable  under  the  current  policy  and  institutional  setting.  At  the  same \ntime,  comparison  of  different  potential  estimates  can  also  tell  what  can  be  done  to \nincrease the RMB\u2019s share in global currency reserves. \n\nThe currencies identified in the IMF Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange \nReserves (COFER) database are the US dollar, euro, pound sterling, yen, Swiss franc, \nand a category of all other currencies. Because some member countries choose not to \nreport  the  currency  compositions  of their foreign  reserves,  the  model  below  takes the \ncurrency  composition  of  the  allocated  reserves  (about  70%  of  total  reserves)  as  the \ndependent variable representing the reserve currency share.  \n\nWe use quarterly data for the period 1999\u20132011 because data before January 1999 do \nnot  cover  the  euro.  An  economy\u2019s  GDP  and  trade  share  in  the  world  are  included  to \ntackle  the  impact  of  the  scale  of  the  economy.  Inflation  differential  (vis-\u00e0-vis  OECD \naverage  inflation)  and  exchange  rate  volatility  (3-year  monthly  average,  national \ncurrency vis-\u00e0-vis the SDR) are added to the model to capture features of the stability \nof  the  currency.  The  stock  market  capitalization  as  a  share  of  five  major  financial \ncenters  (New  York,  London,  Tokyo,  Euronext,  and  Zurich)  combined  and  the  ratio  of \nsuch  a  capitalization  level  to  GDP  are  derived  to  reflect  the  development  of  financial \nmarkets. Data on stock market capitalization are obtained from the World Federation of \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 482 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Huang, Wang, and Fan \n\nExchanges, while the others are obtained from the IMF International Financial Statistics \nand CEIC. \n\nWe  use  currency  appreciation  to  proxy  market  participants\u2019  implicit  demand  for  the \ncurrency.4 As  suggested  by  Li  and  Liu  (2008),  long-term  appreciation  would  also  be \nhelpful  for  achieving  the  \u201cstore  of  value\u201d  function  of  an  international  currency.  To \nmeasure  the  extent  of  capital  account  liberalization,  previous  researchers  have \nproposed  two  distinct  approaches.  The  de  jure  approach  is  based  on  legislative \nrestrictions  (Chinn  and  Ito  2008),  while  the  de  facto  one  is  often  constructed  as  the \nratio of gross cross-border capital stock to GDP (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti 2007). Since \nthe  quarterly  data  are  employed,  the  more  refined  de  facto  index  is  a  better  fit.  The \nindicator  introduced  to  describe  the  overall  institution  is  adopted  from  Economic \nFreedom of the World: 2012 Annual Report by the Fraser Institute. Economic freedom \nis  a  composite  index  constructed  from  42  variables  in  5  broad  areas:  size  of \ngovernment,  legal  system  and  property  rights,  sound  money,  freedom  to  trade \ninternationally, and regulation.5 \n\nThe following model specification is adopted in empirical estimation: \n\n=\n\nshare\nit\n\u03b3\n+\nFXA\n1\nit\n\n\u03b1 \u03b2\n+\nGDP\n1\nit\nKALib\nit\n\n1\n+\n\n\u03b3\n2\n\n+\n\n+\n\n\u03b2\nTrade\n2\nit\n\u03b3\nMktGDP\n3\nit\n\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\nMktCap\n3\n4\nit\n\u03b3\n+\nInstitution\n4\nit\n\n+\n\nInf\n+\n\n+\n\nFXV\nit\n\n\u03b2\n5\nshare\n, 1\ni t\n\nit\n\u03b3\n5\n\n+\n\n\u03b5\u2212\n+\n\nit\n\n \n\nwhere GDP is the country\u2019s share in global GDP, Trade is the country\u2019s share in global \ntrade,  MktCap  is  total  market  capitalization,  Inf  is  inflation  differential  vis-\u00e0-vis  the \nOECD average, FXV is exchange rate volatility, FXA is currency appreciation, KALib is \ncapital  account  liberalization  index,  MktGDP  is  market  capitalization  relative  to  GDP, \nand  Institution  is  the  economic  freedom  index.

The F-statistic and Hausman test validate a \nfixed-effects  panel  regression  model.  Model  (1),  the  basic  model,  replicates  previous \nexercises,  such  as  those  by  Chinn  and  Frankel  (2005)  and  Chen,  Peng,  and  Shu \n(2009). It is not surprising that the size of GDP and that of the financial market are very \nimportant in determining the currency share in global reserve holdings. However, both \ninflation and exchange rate volatility are not significant, possibly a consequence of the \nshort sample period, as discussed in Chen, Peng, and Shu (2009). The lag-dependent \nvariable, as expected, has very strong explanatory power.  \n\nModel  (2)  considers  the  development  of  financial  markets,  by  adding  the  ratio  of \nfinancial market capitalization to GDP. This variable tells something about the financial \ndevelopment  in  a  country.  We  should  be  clear,  however,  that  it  only  captures  the \nquantity  dimension  of  financial  development,  nothing  about  depth,  liquidity,  and \nsophistication  of financial  markets.  Model  (3) further  includes  currency  appreciation  in \nthe model, which reflects implicit demand for the currency. Model (4) adds the capital \naccount  liberalization  index,  which  really  is  a  prerequisite  for  international  currency \nholding.  And  finally,  Model  (5)  includes  the  economic  freedom  indicator  to  control  the \nimpact of a broad range of policies and institutions.  \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 482 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Huang, Wang, and Fan \n\nTable 5: Panel Regressions of Determination of Currency Shares \n\nExplanatory Variables \n\nGDP share \n\n \nTrade share \n \nInflation \n \nExchange rate volatility \n \nMkt_Cap \n \nMkt_Cap/GDP \n \nAppreciation \n\n \nCapital account liberalization \n \nEconomic freedom \n \nLag of share \n \nConstant \n \n\nObservation \nR-squared \n\nDependent Variable: currency share in global reserves \n\n(1) \n\n(2) \n\n(3) \n\n(4) \n\n(5) \n\n0.145** \n(0.0576) \n0.146*** \n(0.0491) \n\u20130.0664 \n(0.086) \n0.0856 \n(0.0726) \n0.0349* \n(0.0203) \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n0.898*** \n(0.0198) \n\u20130.0151** \n(0.00355) \n\n255 \n0.948 \n\n0.146** \n(0.0576) \n0.156*** \n(0.051) \n\u20130.0612 \n(0.086) \n0.0991 \n(0.075) \n0.0327* \n(0.0195) \n0.00112 \n(0.00156) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0.897*** \n(0.0198) \n\u20130.0172*** \n(0.00370) \n\n255 \n0.948 \n\n0.0964* \n(0.0523) \n0.0975** \n(0.046) \n\u20130.0364 \n(0.0778) \n0.0378 \n(0.0657) \n0.0193 \n(0.0185) \n0.00137 \n(0.0014) \n0.0673*** \n(0.00886) \n \n \n \n \n0.925*** \n(0.0182) \n\u20130.0093*** \n(0.00166) \n\n255 \n0.958 \n\n0.0945* \n(0.052) \n0.100** \n(0.0464) \n\u20130.0513 \n(0.0776) \n0.0666 \n(0.0677) \n0.0248 \n(0.0186) \n0.000802 \n(0.00142) \n0.0672*** \n(0.0088) \n0.00631** \n(0.00311) \n \n \n0.907*** \n(0.0202) \n\u20130.0141** \n(0.00698) \n\n255 \n0.959 \n\n0.103* \n(0.0523) \n0.092* \n(0.052) \n\u20130.0133 \n(0.0871) \n0.121 \n(0.0811) \n0.0169 \n(0.0194) \n0.000862 \n(0.0014) \n0.0674*** \n(0.0093) \n0.00849** \n(0.0036) \n0.0043* \n(0.0025) \n0.891*** \n(0.0265) \n\u20130.048** \n(0.0226) \n\n235 \n0.958 \n\nGDP = gross domestic product, Mkt_Cap = market capitalization.  \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \n\nThe  general  findings  are  that  size  matters.  A  country\u2019s  GDP  and  trade  shares  in  the \nworld  play  very  important  roles  in  determining  its  currency  share  in  global  currency \nreserves. Currency appreciation, capital account liberalization, and economic freedom \nare also quite important in affecting the currency share. However, coefficient estimates \nof other variables such as inflation volatility and financial market capitalization are not \nsignificant in the estimated models. We suspect that these are mainly results of a data \nquality  problem.  For  instance,  market  capitalization  is  probably  not  an  accurate \nrepresentative  of  the  actual  degree  of  financial  market  development.  In  the  appendix, \nwe report results from various robustness checks to validate our findings.   \n\nHaving  obtained  the  results,  we  then  predict  the  likely  share  of  the  RMB  in  global \ncurrency  reserves.  We  assume  the  share  to  be  zero  in  the  first  quarter  of  1999  and \nthen apply estimated parameters and actual values of the independent variables for the \nPRC  to  predict  the  RMB\u2019s  share.  Since  the  share  of  currency  in  foreign  reserve \nholdings  is  nonnegative,  during  the  recursive  process  one  should  always  choose  the \nmaximum  of  zero  and  the  predicted  value.  The  predicted  RMB  shares  at  the  end  of \n2011 are 10.1% under Model (1), 8.9% under Model (2), 5.3% under Model (3), 6.8% \nunder  Model  (4),  and  2.2%  under  Model  (5).  In  general,  the  more  policy  and \ninstitutional variables are included in estimation, the lower the estimated share for the \nRMB in global currency reserves. \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 482 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Huang, Wang, and Fan \n\nComparison of these predictions also reinforces one of our important arguments\u2014the \npredicted potentials simply based on quantitative measures are probably too optimistic \n(Figure  3).  For  instance,  if  we  just  look  at  the  PRC\u2019s  GDP  and  trade  shares  in  the \nworld,  the  RMB\u2019s  share  should  be  around  10%.  This  is  possible  if  all  policy  and \ninstitutions  in  the  PRC  are  similar  to  those  in  the  US  and  other  developed  countries. \nYet,  we  know  this  is  not  true.  If  we  take  into  account  several  important  policy \nconsiderations  and  institutions,  such  as  capital  account  liberalization  and  economic \nfreedom, then RMB\u2019s actual potential share comes down to only around 2%. However, \nwe  think  this  last  number  makes  sense  because  (i)  it  tells  us  what  the  PRC  can \nrealistically  achieve  now  and  (ii)  what  reform  actions  the  PRC  needs  to  undertake  in \norder to realize the 10% potential. \n\nFigure 3: Counterfactual Exercise\u2014Linear Models \n\nModel (1)\nModel (2)\nModel (3)\nModel (4)\nModel (5)\n\n12%\n\n10%\n\n8%\n\n6%\n\n4%\n\n2%\n\n0%\n\n \n\n2005-Q1\n\n2006-Q1\n\n2007-Q1\n\n2008-Q1\n\n2009-Q1\n\n2010-Q1\n\n2011-Q1\n\nNote: Models (1)\u2013(5) are consistent with those models reported in Table 2. \n\n  \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \n\n3.3  Summary \n\nBased  on  the  above  analyses,  we  propose  three  sets  of  factors  that  are  critical  for \nproducing  an  international  currency:  (i)  economic  weights,  (ii)  openness  and  depth  of \nfinancial  markets,  (iii)  and  credibility  of  economic  and  legal  systems.  Comparing  the \nPRC\u2019s situation using these criteria may suggest that while the RMB\u2019s international role \nis likely to rise in the coming years, it would be difficult for it to become a global reserve \ncurrency anytime soon. \n\nThe  first  factor  should  create  more  chances  of  using  a  country\u2019s  own  currency  in \ninternational transactions. It is useful to note, however, that while economic weights are \nimportant,  they  are  perhaps  not  the  most  fundamental  factors.  The  Swiss  franc  is  an \ninternational  currency,  although  the  size  of  the  Swiss  economy  is  relatively  small. \nConversely, the US dollar did not become a global currency before World War I when \nthe  US  economy  was  already  bigger  than  the  economies  of  the  United  Kingdom, \nGermany,  and  France  combined.  Nonetheless,  the  PRC\u2019s  rising  importance  in  global \nGDP  and  trade  has  already  generated  some  demand  for  the  RMB  as  a  settlement \ncurrency.  It  is  not  too  difficult  to  imagine  such  demand  rise  rapidly  as  the  PRC \nbecomes the largest economy in the world over the coming decade. \n\nThe second factor determines how easily nonresidents can access the currency, make \nan  investment,  liquidate  it,  and  hedge  the  risk.  The  yen  provides  a  good  case.  For \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 482 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Huang, Wang, and Fan \n\ndecades,  Japan  was  the  world\u2019s  second  largest  economy  and  the  size  of  its  financial \nmarkets  was  phenomenal.  However,  the  role  of  the  yen  as  an  international  currency \npeaked  in  the  late  1980s.  This  was  partly  because  the  Japanese  economy  entered  a \nlong period of stagnation. More fundamentally, however, it was due to the fact that the \nJapanese  financial  markets  are  not  really  open  to  foreign  investors.  With  capital \naccount controls and primitive financial markets, the PRC lags significantly in this area \nbefore the RMB can truly become an international currency. \n\nAnd  the  third  factor  underscores  investor  confidence  in  the  currency  by  supporting \ncurrency, financial, economic, and even political stability. It is perhaps no coincidence \nthat all existing global reserve currencies are from developed economies. And the US \ndollar  did  not  rise  to  international  currency  status  until  after  the  establishment  of  the \nFederal Reserve System. This is probably the most difficult area for the PRC to catch \nup. The gaps  between  the  PRC and  those  existing  international  currency  countries  in \nthe five categories of the economic freedom index discussed are very wide, especially \nin the legal system and property rights, sound money, and regulation. \n\n4.  WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE? \n\nThe key challenge facing the PBC and other PRC authorities now is how to raise the \nRMB\u2019s  potential  share  in  global  reserves  from  2%  identified  by  Model  (5)  to  10% \nidentified  by  Model  (1)  and  even  higher  levels  in  the  future.  The  main  difference \nbetween the two model specifications is a set of policy and institutional gaps.  \n\nThe  PBC  has  adopted  a  two-track  approach  in  internationalizing  the  RMB:  one  is  to \npromote  the  international  use  of  the  RMB  and  the  other  is  to  liberalize  the  capital \naccount  (PBC  Study  Group  2006).  We  may  regard  the  first  track  as  facilitating \nnonresidents  to  use  and  hold  RMB  and  the  second  as  creating  demand  for  RMB  by \nnonresidents. The first-track strategies are important because a currency becomes an \ninternational  currency  only  if  nonresidents  use  it,  but  the  second-track  strategies  are \nmore critical\u2014the US dollar has been the global currency mainly because of the strong \nUS economy, its efficient and liquid market, and its sound legal system. \n\nMost of the authorities\u2019 recent policy actions are related to the first track. These include \nuse  of  the  RMB  in  trade  and  investment  settlement,  setting  up  of  offshore  markets, \nissuance  of  RMB-denominated  securities  products  overseas,  and  holding  of  RMB  as \npart  of  foreign  central  banks\u2019  currency  reserves,  etc.  These  efforts  should  continue. \nThe  authorities  may  even  take  further  steps  to  encourage  nonresidents  to  hold  RMB. \nOne  such  possible  step  is  to  add  RMB  to  the  IMF\u2019s  SDR  basket  and  another  is  to \npromote intraregional cross-holding of reserve currencies as proposed by Fan, Wang, \nand Huang (2013). \n\nThe SDR was first established in 1969 as a supplement to the US dollar as a source of \ninternational liquidity (Williamson 2009), but it is only an imperfect reserve asset since it \ndoes  not  allow  accomplishment  of  functions  such  as  market  intervention  and  liquidity \nprovision  (IMF  2011).  The  SDR  basket  currently  consists  of  four  major  global \ncurrencies only (Table 6). Adding the RMB to the basket would not only make it a part \nof  the  global  reserve  assets  but  also  significantly  increase  its  global  profile.  The  IMF \nwas initially reluctant about the idea of including the RMB in the SDR basket but now \nsuggests that \u201crecent reforms that allow nonresidents, including central banks, to hold \nRMB-denominated  deposits  \u2026  could  contribute,  over  time,  to  resolving  some  of  the \ntechnical difficulties in hedging RMB exposure\u201d (IMF 2011, 20).  \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 482 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Huang, Wang, and Fan \n\nTable 6: Official Special Drawing Right Weights (%) \n\n \n\n1990 \n\n1995 \n\n1998 \n\n2000 \n\n2005 \n\n2010 \n\nUS dollar \nDeutsche mark \nFrench franc \nEuro \nYen \nPound sterling \nTotal \n\n40 \n21 \n11 \n \n17 \n11 \n100 \n\n39 \n21 \n11 \n \n18 \n11 \n100 \n\n39 \n \n \n32 \n18 \n11 \n100 \n\n45 \n \n \n29 \n15 \n11 \n100 \n\n44 \n \n \n34 \n11 \n11 \n100 \n\n41.9 \n \n \n37.4 \n9.4 \n11.3 \n100 \n\nSource: International Monetary Fund Special Drawing Right Statistics. \n\nFan  and  his  collaborators  made  a  proposal  in  2010  to  establish  an  intraregional \nmechanism  for  cross-holding  of  reserve  currencies  (see  Fan,  Wang,  and  Huang \n2013). 7 The  key  idea  is  for  governments  in  Asia  to  reach  bilateral  agreements  in \nholding  each  other\u2019s  currencies  as  part  of  their  foreign  reserves.  Weights  of  such \ncurrency  holdings  may  be  determined  by  shares  of  their  bilateral  trade  in  total  trade. \nThis  arrangement  has  some  similarities  to  currency  swap  agreements,  which  are \nmainly  a  crisis  response  mechanism  (although  sometimes  also  used  as  a  means  to \npromote  trade  and  investment),  while  cross-reserve  holdings  are  part  of  regular \noperations.  It  immediately  makes  regional  currencies  available  as  reserve  currencies, \nopens government bond markets to each other, and also encourages parties involved \nto monitor others\u2019 macroeconomic and policy development. \n\nOur  view,  however,  is  that  whether  or  not  the  RMB  can  become  an  international \ncurrency  will  fundamentally  be  determined  by the  broadly  defined  second  track  of the \nPBC. The PRC can encourage nonresidents to hold RMB, but it will not last if  it does \nnot  possess  the  essential  qualities  of  an  international  currency.  For  instance,  the \namount  of  offshore  RMB  deposits  often  fluctuates  alongside  changes  in  currency \nexpectation.  We  now  discuss  some  of  the  important  reforms  that  could  underscore \nthese three factors. \n\n4.1  Economic Weights \n\nSo far the  hope for the RMB  to  become  an  international  currency  is  mainly  driven  by \nthe rapid rise  of the  economy.  During  the first  30  years  of economic reform, the  PRC \nmaintained  an  average  GDP  growth  rate  of  10%.  By  the  end  of  2010,  it  had  already \nsurpassed  Japan  to  become  the  world\u2019s  second  largest  economy.  The  general \nexpectation  is  that,  if  the  strong  growth  momentum  continues,  the  PRC  will  likely \novertake the US to become the largest economy in the world within the next 10 years. \nGrowth  sustainability  should  be  one  of  the  fundamental  factors  supporting  a  rising \nRMB.  The  declining  international  role  of the  yen  in  the  1990s  as  its  economy fell  into \nstagnation offers an important lesson for the PRC. \n\nHowever,  the  sustainability  of  the  country\u2019s  growth  could  be  a  big  question  mark. \nDespite  its  strong  growth  performance,  economists  and  officials  have  long  been \nworried about its growth model. Former Premier Wen Jiabao once pointed out that the \nPRC  growth  model  is  \u201cunstable,  unbalanced,  uncoordinated  and  unsustainable.\u201d 8 \nSome  of  the  key  structural  problems  frequently  discussed  include  unusually  high \n\n                                                \n7\n This paper was first completed in 2010 as a project report for the PRC Center for International Economic \nExchange  (CCIEE).  It  was  presented  at  the  ADBI/CCIEE  joint  workshop  on  regional  currency \ncooperation in November 2010.  \n\n8\n See http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-03/16/content_5856569.htm \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 482 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Huang, Wang, and Fan \n\ninvestment share of GDP, heavy dependency on resource consumption, large current \naccount  surplus,  unequal  income  distribution,  and  serious  pollution.  The  IMF\u2019s  latest \nreport  on  Article  IV  consultation  also  confirmed  the  international  community\u2019s  worry \nabout the PRC\u2019s structural problems (IMF 2013). \n\nimbalances?  One  explanation \n\nSo what lies behind the PRC\u2019s unique growth model with strong economic growth but \nserious  structural \nthe  so-called  \u201casymmetric \nliberalization  of  the  market.\u201d  On  the  one  hand,  product  markets  have  almost  been \ncompletely liberalized; on the other, distortions in factor markets have remained broad \nand serious. In general, such policy distortions depressed costs of labor, land, energy, \ncapital,  and  water,  subsidized  owners  of  the  endowments  (e.g.,  producers,  investors, \nand  exporters),  and  literally  functioned  at  the  cost  of  households.  This  special \nmechanism  redistributing  income  from  households  to  enterprises  was  the  key  reason \neconomic growth was unusually strong but the economic structure became increasingly \nimbalanced (Huang 2010; Huang and Tao 2010; Huang and Wang 2010). \n\nis \n\nThe good  news  is  that  rebalancing  of the  PRC economy  is  already  under  way. There \nare  at  least  three  pieces  of  evidence  supporting  this  claim  (Huang  et  al.  2013):  One, \nthe current account surplus has already narrowed from 10.8% of GDP in 2007 to below \n3.0% in recent years. This is the reason some officials argue that the RMB exchange \nrate  is  now  close  to  equilibrium.  Two,  recent  studies  suggest  that  shares  of  total  and \nhousehold  consumption  in  GDP  started  to  pick  up  after  2007  and  2008  (Huang  et  al. \n2013).  And  three,  official  estimates  of  the  Gini  coefficient  point  to  continued \nimprovement in income distribution among households after 2008.  \n\nSo far, improvements have been mainly triggered by the rapid rise of wages as a result \nof the emerging labor shortage problem in the PRC (Figure 4). Rapidly growing wages \nsqueeze  corporate  profits  and  therefore  slow  production,  investment,  and  export \nactivities.  At  the  same  time,  they  also  redistribute  income  back  to  households  from \ncorporations  and  therefore  contribute  to  faster  growth  of  consumption.  However, \nchange of the growth model is only in its nascence and further reforms are necessary \nto push the PRC\u2019s growth model onto a more sustainable path. \n\nFigure 4: Monthly Wages of Migrant Workers in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(yuan, 1978 price) \n\nReal salary\n\nPolynominal trend\n\n400\n\n350\n\n300\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n1980\n\n1988\n\n1996\n\n2004\n\n2012\n\n \n\nSource:  Lu  Feng.  2011.

The original data set ended in 2010 and was updated \nby the authors up to 2012. \n\n19 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 482 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Huang, Wang, and Fan \n\nEconomic policies under the Li Keqiang-led government, the so-called Likonomics, are \nmoving  in  the  right  direction.  Likonomics  is  popularly  regarded  as  supported  by  three \npillars:  no  major  stimulus,  deleveraging,  and  structural  reforms  (Huang  2013).  Since \nlate 2012, the government has shown an unusual tolerance for slowing growth, as GDP \ngrowth stayed constantly below 8%. Although the policy makers are still mindful about \ndownside  risks,  they  take  a  relatively  more  relaxed  approach  toward  the  growth \nslowdown as long as it stays close to the new and lower growth potential, evidenced by \nthe robust labor market. \n\nThe  success  or  failure  of  Likonomics  will  be  determined  by  the  outcome  of  the \nstructural  reforms.  Policy  makers  and  policy  advisors  are  currently  working  on \nproposals  for  an  extended  reform  agenda,  including  the  financial  sector,  fiscal  policy, \nland  use,  factor  price,  income  distribution,  administrative  controls,  and  household \nregistration system. These are all very important, but the following three will dictate the \nsustainability of the PRC\u2019s growth: (i) change of local government behavior from direct \ninvolvement  in  economic  activities  to  public  goods  provision;  (ii)  restructuring  of  the \nstate-owned  enterprises  to  reduce  monopoly  power  and  implicit  government  support; \nand (iii) liberalization of factor markets, especially that of capital. These reforms should \nsupport the continuous rise of the country\u2019s economy in the global system and further \nincrease the importance of the currency. \n\nIn the meantime, it is equally important for the PRC to participate or even lead global \nliberalization  efforts,  including  the  Group  of  Twenty  process  and  other  international \ninitiatives. It is hard to imagine the RMB as a global currency if the PRC is absent from \nor even resists such global initiatives. \n\n4.2  Openness and Depth of Financial Markets \n\nAn international currency should be supported by well-developed financial markets that \nare  freely  accessible  by  nonresidents,  sufficiently  liquid,  reasonably  stable,  and \nequipped  with  effective hedging  instruments. To  achieve  these goals,  the  PRC needs \nto  liberalize  its  capital  account  to  allow  free  flow  of  capital  across  the  border.  That \nalone,  however,  is  not  enough.  The  lack  of  capital  account  restrictions  does  not \nnecessarily mean that the capital market is open. Here, again, Japan provides another \nimportant  reference. While  Japan\u2019s  capital  markets  are  large,  they  are  not  very  liquid \nand foreign investment remains limited. \n\nThe  PRC appears to  have  accelerated  its  efforts  of  capital  account  liberalization  after \nthe new government took office in March 2013. One expectation is that the PBC plans \nto  achieve  basic  convertibility  of  the  RMB  under  the  capital  account  by  2015  and  full \nconvertibility  by  2020.  Such  an  expectation  is  certainly  consistent  with  the  monetary \nauthority\u2019s  plans  of  introducing  market-based  interest  rates,  adopting  the  deposit \ninsurance  system,  strengthening  market  disciplines  for  financial  institutions,  and \nallowing residents to access overseas capital markets. \n\nIt  is  important  to  point  out  that  capital  account  liberalization  did  not  just  start.  It  has \nbeen  going  on  for  more  than  30  years  in  the  PRC.  We  can  use  some  quantitative \nmeasures  of  capital  account  control  to  illustrate  this  point  (Figure  5).  The  literature \nprovides  two  types  of  measures  for  the  PRC\u2019s  capital  account  controls:  one  de  jure \nindicator,  such  as  the  Chinn\u2013Ito  index  (Chinn  and  Ito  2008)  and  Quinn\u2019s  longitudinal \ndata  (Quinn  and  Toyoda  2008);  and  the  other  de  facto  indicator  such  as  the  TOTAL \nIndex  by  Lane  and  Milesi-Ferretti  (2007).  The  former  often  has  too  broad  a  category \ncoverage  and  fails  to  capture  important  changes  over  time,  while  the  latter  cannot \ndistinguish impacts of capital account liberalization from those of other macroeconomic \nchanges. The measure depicted in Figure 5 is a de jure index constructed by Huang et \n\n20 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 482 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Huang, Wang, and Fan \n\nal.  (2012)  by  going  through  thousands  of  policy  documents  issued  by  the  State \nAdministration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) during the past three decades. \n\nHuang et al. (2012) assumed complete control of the capital account for 1977, the year \nbefore  the  leaders  officially  launched  the  economic  reform.  They  then  adopted  the \nclassifications used by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \nand SAFE, i.e., 11 categories of capital account transactions. For each item, a score of \n3  denotes full control,  2 strong  control,  1 slight  control,  and  0  liberalized.  By  updating \nthe  index  in  response  to  legislation  issued,  an  index  ranging  from  January  1978  to \nDecember  2010  is  constructed  to  describe  the  extensiveness  of  the  PRC\u2019s  capital \ncontrol. The  results  clearly  show  that  capital  account  liberalization  has been going  on \nfor  some  time  in  the  PRC.  In  fact,  the  authorities  adopted  a  well-established  strategy \nfor liberalization\u2014inflows first, outflows later; long-term first, short-term later; and direct \ninvestment  first,  portfolio  investment  later.  If  the  index  was  100  at  the  start  of  the \neconomic reform, it has already come down to close to 50 in recent years. \n\nFigure 5: Capital Account Restriction Index \n\n100\n\n95\n\n90\n\n85\n\n80\n\n75\n\n70\n\n65\n\n60\n\n55\n\n50\n\nSep-77 Sep-81 Sep-85 Sep-89 Sep-93 Sep-97 Sep-01 Sep-05 Sep-09\n\n \n\nSource: Huang et al. (2012). \n\nYet,  several  areas  are  still  under  strict  regulation  (Table  7).  In  opening  the  securities \nmarkets  to  foreign  investors,  the  government  pursued  a  strategy  of  segmenting  the \nmarkets with different investors. Foreign investors can participate in the transaction of \nforeign  currency\u2013denominated  shares  and  debt  instruments,  such  as  the  B  shares,  H \nshares,  and  red  chips  stocks.  However,  the  RMB-denominated  A  shares,  bonds,  or \nother money market instruments are not open to the nonresident investors unless they \nhave  a  QFII  quota.  Restrictions  on  PRC  residents  are  even  stricter.  Generally, \nresidents  cannot  buy,  sell,  or  issue  capital  or  money  market  instruments  in  the \noverseas markets outside the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) scheme.  \n\nThere  is  currently  a  huge  debate  in  the  PRC  about  planned  capital  account \nliberalization,  especially  about  its  sequencing  and  timing.  While  most  economists \nconcur  that  achieving  free  capital  account  is  beneficial  for  the  economy  by  bringing \nabout  efficiency  improvement,  the  critical  question  is  about  associated  financial  risk. \nAre  the  financial  institutions  and  markets  sound  enough  to  withstand  volatile  capital \nflows? As suggested by McKinnon (1991), domestic reforms should be pushed forward \nalong  with  the  opening  of  the  capital  account.  These  reforms  consist  of  reduction  of \nstate intervention in the operation of major financial institutions, introduction of market-\nbased  interest  rates,  greater  flexibility  of  the  exchange  rate,  and  improvement  in  the \n\n21 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 482 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Huang, Wang, and Fan \n\nindependence  of  the  central  bank\u2019s  monetary  policy  making  (Dobson  and  Masson \n2009). \n\nTable 7: Capital Account Management in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n\n \n\nNon \nConvertible \n\nPartially \nConvertible \n\nMostly \nConvertible \n\nFully \nConvertible \n\nTotal \n\nCapital and money market instrument \nDerivatives and other instruments \nCredit operation \nDirect investment \nLiquidation of direct investment \nReal estate transaction \nPersonal capital transaction \n\n16 \n4 \n6 \n2 \n1 \n3 \n8 \n40 \nSources:  People\u2019s  Bank  of  China;  International  Monetary  Fund  Annual  Report  on  Exchange  Arrangements \nand Exchange Restrictions Report. \n\n10 \n2 \n1 \n1 \n \n2 \n6 \n\n4 \n \n5 \n1 \n1 \n1 \n2 \n\n2 \n2 \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nTotal \n\n22 \n\n14 \n\n4 \n\n \n\n4.3  Credibility of Economic and Legal Systems \n\nAn international currency is one that nonresidents would use not only in normal times \nbut  also  depend  on  at  crisis  times.  Therefore,  just  having  a  strong  economy  and  an \nopen market is not sufficient. The US dollar served as a global currency during much of \nthe  20th  century  because  of  the  well-established  legal  system  in  the  US  and  the \nFederal  Reserve  System,  as  well  as  its  efficient  market  and  strong  economy.  This  is \nperhaps  the  highest  hurdle  that  the  PRC  will  need  to  overcome  in  order  to  make  the \nRMB an international currency. If the PRC succeeds, it would be historical because it \nwould  be  the  first  time  in  centuries  that  a  developing  country\u2019s  currency  becomes  a \nglobal  currency\u2014and  developing  economies  by  definition  are  unstable,  volatile \n(although often with stronger growth), and vulnerable in the face of shocks. \n\nWe are unable to provide a complete list of the tasks for improving the credibility of the \nPRC\u2019s  economic  and  legal  system,  but  we  can  start  with  at  least  the  following  three. \nOne, the PRC needs an independent central bank. While there are many reasons the \nPBC  is  not  independent\u2014and  perhaps  there  are  many  good  reasons  why  that  is  the \ncase\u2014this  could  seriously  affect  the  achievement  of  monetary  policy  objectives  in  an \nopen  economy.  Of  course,  independent  monetary  policy  making  does  not  mean \ncomplete  lack  of  coordination  with  the  government.  It  should  possess  the  following \ncharacteristics.  First,  monetary  policies  should  have  clearly  defined  policy  objectives, \nsuch  as  growth  or  inflation.  Supporting  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  or  local \ngovernments, however, should not be a part of the PBC\u2019s obligation. Second, the PBC \nshould use monetary policy instruments such as interest rates and liquidity measures, \nabandoning administrative tools such as credit quota and window guidance. And finally, \nthe PBC should also improve quality and timeliness of its monetary policies. \n\nTwo, the PRC needs a fair and transparent legal system to protect property rights and \nto enforce bankruptcy. An economy with many loss-making SOEs and monopoly state-\nowned financial institutions could never support an international currency. Nonresidents \nwill have confidence in holding RMB assets only if they know that their property rights \nare  effectively  protected  and  they  will  be  fairly  treated  even  if  they  are  involved  in \neconomic disputes with PRC SOEs. \n\nAnd  three,  political  reforms  may  also  be  needed  to  improve  the  transparency  and \nrepresentativeness  of  the  political  system.  While  we  do  not  have  a  fixed  idea  about \nspecific forms of needed political reform, to become a global economic leader, the PRC \n\n22 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 482 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Huang, Wang, and Fan \n\nneeds  to  adopt  a  political  system  that  the  rest  of  the  world  trusts.  Here,  again, \nimportant  changes  are  necessary  to  systemically  crack  down  on  corruption,  reduce \nsocial tension, and build a harmonious society. \n\n5.  WHAT ARE THE LIKELY IMPLICATIONS? \n\nInternationalization  of  the  RMB  will  likely  be  an  ongoing  process  and  making  it  an \ninternational  reserve  currency  should  also  be  a  long-term  goal.  Before  that,  however, \nthe  RMB\u2019s  international  role  may  grow  gradually  over  time.  Some  PRC  scholars \nspeculated  that  it  would  take  three  decades  for  it  to  be  internationalized:  in  the \nneighboring areas during the first decade, within the region during the second decade, \nand  globally  during  the  final  decade  (Chen  2013).  While  we  are  not  sure  about  the \nexact timing of each of these stages, the trajectory sounds reasonable, i.e., the RMB\u2019s \nrole will be extended gradually from the neighboring areas to the global system. \n\nThe  growing  international  role  of  the  RMB,  even  if  it  is  a  gradual  process,  should \ngenerate  significant  implications for  the  PRC,  regional  economies,  and  the  rest  of the \nworld.  First,  increasing  its  use  in  international  trade  and  investment  settlement  could \nremove one important economic risk\u2014exchange rate uncertainty\u2014for PRC households \nand  corporations.  Exchange  rate  uncertainty  is  one  of  the  main  difficulties  faced  by \nexporters, especially those of low-margin exports, and importers. Use of the RMB as a \nsettlement currency means that the exporters no longer need to worry about potential \nlosses  caused  by  currency  appreciation  (or  by  currency  depreciation  for  importers). \nHowever,  this  is  true  only  if  exports  or  imports  are  priced  in  RMB.  Currently,  a  large \nportion of trade and investment settled in RMB are still priced in US dollars, which will \nnot  remove  the  exchange  rate  risk  for  PRC  exporters  and  importers.  Therefore,  a \ncritical  step  is  to  grant  the  RMB  not  only  the  function  of  means  of  exchange  but  also \nunit of account. \n\nSecond,  turning  the  RMB  into  an  international  reserve  currency  may  help  reduce  the \nPRC\u2019s  balance  of  payment  risks,  in  addition  to  the  seigniorage  revenue.  On  the  one \nhand,  as  the  PRC  is  able  to  hold  both  international  assets  and  liabilities  in  RMB,  it \nlowers the risk of a currency crisis, potentially forced upon the PRC by a sudden stop \nor sudden reversal of cross-border capital flows. On the other hand, even if the country \nsuffers from an international payment deficit, the PBC would have the option of printing \nmore  currency  to  meet  the  shortfall.  International  investor  confidence  in  a  global \nreserve  currency  should  also  be  less  volatile  than  that  in  any  other  developing \neconomy currencies\u2014and this should support overall financial stability. \n\nThird,  the  RMB  as  a  global  reserve  currency  should  facilitate  regional  economic \ncooperation  and  integration.  East  Asia  used  to  be  a  de  facto  US  dollar  block.  In  the \n1980s, the yen became an important anchor for some regional currencies such as the \nwon and the NT dollar. This led Mundell to identify Asia dominated by the yen as one of \nthe three islands of stability\u2014the other two were North America dominated by the US \ndollar  and  Europe  dominated  by  the  euro  (Mundell  1999).  However,  the  yen  quickly \npeaked  following  stagnation  of  the  Japanese  economy.  In  the  aftermath  of  the  Asian \nfinancial crisis, there was an important proposal for creating an Asian currency (Kawai \n2008). This proposal, however, lost momentum as its role model, the eurozone, fell into \na  debt  crisis.  However,  if  the  RMB  becomes  an  international  currency,  there  is  a \npossibility for it to serve as an anchor of regional currencies in Asia. In fact, our earlier \nanalyses reveal that it already plays some kind of a role as a regional currency anchor \nalongside the US dollar. \n\n23 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 482 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Huang, Wang, and Fan \n\nLast, the most important implication of RMB internationalization may be the associated \nreforms the PRC is about to implement. As discussed earlier, such reforms range from \nmeasures to make economic growth more sustainable to those leading to improvement \nof  efficiency  and  stability  of  financial  markets  as  well  as  to  economic  and  political \nstability. In this sense, we may view RMB internationalization as having similar effects \non overall economic reform as accession to the World Trade Organization at the end of \n2001,  which  almost  completely  revamped  the  PRC\u2019s  economic  system.  If  the \ngovernment seriously implements those reforms, the economy would certainly become \nmore  efficient,  more  dynamic,  and  more  powerful,  regardless  of  whether  the  RMB \nbecomes an international reserve currency in the end. A stronger economy and a more \ntransparent  regime  can  significantly  strengthen  the  PRC\u2019s  soft  power  in  the  world \n(Helleiner  2003).  Even  for  this  purpose,  RMB  internationalization  is  a  worthwhile \nagenda to pursue. \n\nHowever, internationalization of the RMB, like any other economic strategy, could have \nits  own  downside  risks.  One  potential  risk  is  premature  liberalization  of  the  capital \naccount.  Experiences  of  developing  countries  with financial  liberalization  in  the  1980s \nand thereafter were accompanied by frequent financial crises. At the moment, the PRC \nalready suffers from a series of important risks, including a high M2/GDP ratio at 200%, \nlarge  local  government  borrowing,  and  serious  property  bubbles.  The  government\u2019s \ntentative  reform  program  could  mean  speedy  liberalization  of  interest  rates,  of \nexchange rates, and of the capital account. It is not yet clear how big the shocks will be \nfor  financial  institutions  and  manufacturing  industries.  If  the  sudden  rise  of  cost  of \ncapital and rapid outflow of capital cause serious dislocations in the economy, growth \nrecession  and  financial  crisis  could  easily  materialize.  Even  if  the  RMB  becomes  an \ninternational  reserve  currency,  it  will  have  to  maintain  a  relatively  open  financial \nsystem.  Whether  or  not  the  PRC\u2019s  economy  and  markets  are  strong  enough  to \nwithstand  serious  economic  and  financial  shocks,  including  speculative  attacks, \nremains to be seen. \n\nAnother major challenge is that if the RMB becomes an international reserve currency \nin the coming decades, the PRC should remain a developing country. It would be the \nfirst  time  in  history  that  a  developing  country  currency  serves  as  a  global  reserve \ncurrency.  Developing  country  currencies  are,  by  definition,  less  stable.  This  could \npotentially  increase  the  instability  of  the  international  monetary  system.  More \nimportantly,  if  internationalization  of  the  RMB  is  successful,  the  currency  would  likely \nserve as one of the global reserve currencies, alongside at least the US dollar and the \neuro. According to some experts, an international monetary system with more than one \nglobal  reserve  currency  is  actually  more  unstable  than  one  with  a  single  reserve \ncurrency (UN 2009). If that is indeed true, the international community should seriously \nconsider proposals for creating a supranational currency (Zhou 2009; UN 2009). \n\n6.  SUMMARY OF THE MAIN FINDINGS \n\nThe  PBC  started  planning  the  internationalization  of  the  RMB  from  at  least  2006. \nHowever, actual implementation picked up pace amid the global financial crisis, which \nhinted  at  the  potential  weakening  of  the  role  of  the  US  dollar  and  demand  for  an \nalternative  international  currency.  This  process  likely  will  accelerate  further  in  the \ncoming  years,  as  the  new  government  focuses  more  on  structural  reforms.  The  PBC \nadopted  a  two-track  strategy  for  internationalizing  the  currency,  with  the  first  track \ndirectly promoting the international use of the currency and the second track gradually \nliberalizing the capital account. \n\n24 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 482 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Huang, Wang, and Fan \n\nSo far, the emphasis has been on increasing the international use of the currency. This \nincludes use of the RMB for trade and investment settlement, mainly with neighboring \nand  regional  economies;  establishment  of  offshore  markets  in  Hong  Kong,  China, \nevidenced  by  the  rapid  growth  of  RMB  deposits  held  by  local  residents;  issuance  of \nRMB-denominated  bonds  and  other  securities  in  Hong  Kong,  China  and  London;  a \nlarge  number  of  currency  swap  agreements;  and  holdings  of  RMB  by  some  foreign \ncentral  banks  as  part  of  their  foreign  currency  reserves.  A  significant  increase  in  the \nfactors: \ninternational  use  of \nencouragement  of  the  government,  strong  growth  of  economic  activities  (the  PRC  is \nalready  the  largest  trading  partner  of  many  regional  economies),  and  expectations  of \nRMB appreciation. \n\nis  supported  by \n\nthe  RMB  so \n\nthree  related \n\nfar \n\nHowever,  the  RMB  is  still  far  from  being  an  international  reserve  currency.  Many \noptimists  tend  to  pay  a  lot  of  attention  to  the  PRC\u2019s  already  gigantic  economy.  The \nlogic  is  simple:  the  PRC  is  already  a  major  economy  in  the  world,  and  its  currency \nshould  therefore  play  some  international  role.  A  quick  review  of  experiences  of \ninternational currencies during the 20th century suggests that size of the economy may \nbe an important favorable factor, but it is by no means a sufficient condition. We apply \nquantitative  methods  to  identify  determinants  of  international  currencies\u2019  shares  in \nglobal reserves and then use the results to predict the RMB\u2019s potential share. We find \nthat  if  only  GDP  and  trade  weights  are  used,  its  potential  share  could  be  as  high  as \n10%  of  the  global  reserves  at  the  end  of  2011.  However,  if  policy  and  institutional \nfactors,  such  as  capital  account  controls  and  economic  freedom,  are  considered,  the \nRMB\u2019s  potential  share  would  only  reach  around  2%.  These  results  suggest  that  the \nmain  obstacles  for  the  RMB  to  become  an  international  reserve  currency  are  policy \nrestrictions and institutional barriers. \n\nSo what should the PRC do to effectively internationalize its currency? It can certainly \ncontinue  to  push  on  the  first  track,  i.e.,  promoting  its  use  in  international  economic \ntransactions,  including  establishment  of  more  offshore  markets,  issuance  of  more \nRMB-denominated assets overseas, and use for trade and investment settlement. The \nPRC may also adopt two additional strategies for this purpose. One is to add the RMB \nto the IMF\u2019s SDR basket, which should significantly raise the international profile of the \ncurrency and make internationalization efforts a lot easier. And the other is to introduce \na new mechanism for intraregional cross-holding of reserve currencies in Asia. \n\nHowever,  for  the  purpose  of  currency  internationalization,  the  broadly  defined  second \ntrack of the two-track strategy is probably more critical as it creates the foundation of a \nglobal  reserve  currency.  We  identify  reforms  in  the  following  three  areas  for  this \npurpose. \n\nThe  first  area  is  to  support  the  sustainable  growth  of  the  PRC  economy.  While \neconomic weights are not sufficient conditions for a global reserve currency, any hopes \nfor  the  RMB  to  become  an  international  currency  could  collapse  if  the  economy \nsuddenly stagnates, similar to what happened to the Japanese economy in the 1990s. \nAn  imminent  challenge  for  the  PRC  economy  now  is  to  change  the  growth  model, \nwhich  may  be  characterized  as  a  combination  of  strong  growth  and  serious \nimbalances. The key is to further economic reforms. The new government\u2019s economic \npolicy  framework,  popularly  termed  \u201cLikonomics,\u201d  contains  three  important  pillars\u2014no \nmore  major  stimulus,  deleveraging  to  control  financial  risks,  and  structural  reforms. \nGovernment  officials  and  policy  advisors  are  working  on  reform  programs  for  a  large \nnumber  of  areas,  including the financial  system, fiscal  policy,  land  use,  administrative \ninequality,  and  household  registration  system. \ncontrols, \nSuccessful  transformation  of  the  growth  model  depends  critically  on  the  following \nreforms\u2014liberalization  of  interest  rates,  exchange  rates,  and  the  capital  account; \n\nfactor  prices, \n\nincome \n\n25 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 482 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Huang, Wang, and Fan \n\nchange  of  the  local  governments\u2019  role  from  directly  engaging  in  production  and \ninvestment  to  public  goods  provision;  and  breakdown  of  the  monopoly  power  of  the \nstate sector. \n\nThe  second  area  is  to  create  an  open,  large,  efficient,  and  liquid  financial  market.  To \nserve  as  an  international  reserve  currency,  the  RMB  needs  to  be  supported  by  a \nfinancial  market  that  is  easily  accessible  by  nonresidents.  One  major  step  is  to \nliberalize  the  capital  account.  This  has  been  an  ongoing  process,  with  the  capital \naccount  control  index  declining  from  100%  in  1977  to  53%  in  2011.  The  government \nnow plans to realize basic convertibility by 2015 and full convertibility by 2020. There is, \nhowever, a major debate as to whether this might be too aggressive and could trigger a \nfinancial crisis. The answer to this should be to keep a close eye on both the necessary \nconditions and sequencing of liberalization. Nevertheless, capital account liberalization \nis  also  a  necessary  step  for  currency  internationalization.  However,  financial  markets \nneed  to  be  open,  liquid,  and  efficient,  and  equipped  with  well-developed  hedging \ninstruments. \n\nThe third area is to improve the credibility of the PRC\u2019s economic and political systems. \nThe  essence  of  an  international  reserve  currency  is  that  international  investors  have \nlong-term confidence in it. To support such confidence, the PRC needs to improve its \neconomic,  legal,  and  political  systems.  This  is  particularly  important  since  all  other \nexisting international reserve currencies are from developed economies that have well-\ndeveloped  economic  and  political  systems.  We  suggest  three  starting  steps  for  the \nPRC: (i) an independent monetary policy-making mechanism, (ii) a sound legal system \nthat  protects  property  rights  and  enforces  bankruptcy  law,  and  (iii)  a  political  system \nthat is more transparent and better represented. \n\nEven if all these efforts are successful, we think the internationalization of the RMB will \nbe  a  long-term  process.  We  do  not  think  the  RMB  will  become  a  global  reserve \ncurrency  in  the  coming  decade  or  any  time  soon  after  that.  The  RMB\u2019s  international \nrole, however, may be extended steadily, perhaps first in the neighboring areas, then in \nthe region, and finally globally.  \n\nThis process could also generate significant implications for the PRC, the region, and \nthe rest of the world. If the RMB is used as a unit of account, it would remove exchange \nrate uncertainties for PRC households and corporations in international transactions. If \nthe PRC can hold its international assets and liabilities all in RMB, it should also reduce \nthe  country\u2019s  balance  of  payment  risks,  in  addition  to  the  seigniorage  revenue.  The \nmost fundamental impact of RMB internationalization could be to push comprehensive \nreforms in the PRC economy, similar to the effect of WTO accession on the economy \nmore than 10 years ago. For some PRC officials and scholars, this factor alone would \nmake currency internationalization a worthwhile agenda to pursue. \n\nAt  the  same  time,  an  aggressive  push  of  the  reform  agenda  could  also  increase  the \npotential  risk  of  financial  instability.  Even  if  the  RMB  successfully  becomes  an \ninternational  reserve  currency,  the  PRC  would  have  to  withstand  more  frequent \nfinancial  shocks  or  even  speculative  attacks.  It  also  remains  to  be  seen  if  adding  a \ndeveloping  country  currency  to  the  global  reserve  currency  basket  increases  or \ndecreases the instability of the international monetary system.  \n\n \n\n26 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 482 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Huang, Wang, and Fan \n\nAPPENDIX \n\nWe  perform  four  types  of  robustness  checks  in  this  analysis.  First,  as  argued  in  the \ncontext,  market  capitalization  is  probably  not  an  accurate  representative  of  actual \ndegree  of  financial  market  development.  The  second  column  of  Table  A1  redefines \nfinancial  development  as  a  share  of  private  and  public  bond  market  capitalization  to \ngross  domestic  product  (Beck,  Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt,  and  Levine  2000).  The  alternative \nspecification suggests a positive impact from financial development on currency share \nin global reserves, which is consistent with previous evidence.  \n\nSecond,  instead  of  classifying  institutional  development  as  economic  freedom,  we \nchoose the variables economic regulation and socioeconomic stability as indicating the \ndevelopment  of  institutions. The third  and fourth columns  confirm  the  results  and,  not \nsurprisingly, show that there is no significant difference compared with the benchmark \nmodel in Column 1 of Table A1.  \n\nFinally,  we  include  log  transformation  to  allow  nonlinearity  in  determining  currency \nshare  in  global  reserves,  as  suggested  in  Chen,  Peng,  and  Shu  (2009).  Clearly,  as \nsuggested in the fifth column of Table A1, there is not much discrepancy in terms of the \nsignificance and signs of the estimated coefficients. \n\nTable A1: Robustness Check of Determination of Currency Shares \n\nExplanatory Variables \n\nDependent Variable: currency share in global reserves \n\nGDP share \n\n \nTrade share \n\n \nInflation \n\n \nExchange rate volatility \n\n \nMarket capitalization \n\n \nFinancial development \n\n \nAppreciation \n\n \nCapital account liberalization \n\n \nInstitution \n\n \nLag of share \n\n \nConstant \n\n \nObservation \nR-squared \n \n\nBenchmark \n0.103* \n(0.0523) \n0.092* \n(0.052) \n\u20130.0133 \n(0.0871) \n0.121 \n(0.0811) \n0.0169 \n(0.0194) \n0.000862 \n(0.0014) \n0.0674*** \n(0.0093) \n0.00849** \n(0.0036) \n0.0043* \n(0.0025) \n0.891*** \n(0.0265) \n\u20130.048** \n(0.0226) \n\n235 \n0.958 \n \n\nBond Market \n0.102* \n(0.06) \n0.0736 \n(0.05) \n\u20130.104 \n(0.11) \n0.20  \n(0.14) \n0.015 \n(0.02) \n0.179*** \n(0.0354) \n0.048*** \n(0.0099) \n0.00726** \n(0.0042) \n0.000278* \n(0.00) \n0.911*** \n(0.02) \n\u20130.0433** \n(0.02) \n\n235 \n0.963 \n\nRegulation \n0.124** \n(0.06) \n0.0739 \n(0.06) \n\u20130.047 \n(0.12) \n0.08  \n(0.13) \n0.00997 \n(0.02) \n0.00297 \n(0.00) \n0.0695*** \n(0.01) \n0.0162*** \n(0.01) \n0.00383** \n(0.00) \n0.883*** \n(0.03) \n\u20130.0529*** \n(0.02) \n\n235 \n0.958 \n\nSocio-Eco. \n0.149** \n(0.06) \n0.0517 \n(0.06) \n\u20130.0905 \n(0.12) \n0.17  \n(0.13) \n0.0273 \n(0.02) \n0.00443** \n(0.00) \n0.0647*** \n(0.01) \n0.0206*** \n(0.01) \n0.00231*** \n(0.00) \n0.865*** \n(0.03) \n\u20130.0542*** \n(0.01) \n\n235 \n0.96 \n\nLog Tran. \n0.738** \n(0.37) \n-0.109 \n(0.33) \n0.377 \n(0.72) \n0.43  \n(0.81) \n\u20130.144 \n(0.12) \n0.0405*** \n(0.01) \n0.289*** \n(0.06) \n0.122*** \n(0.03) \n0.0395** \n(0.02) \n0.848*** \n(0.03) \n\u20130.752*** \n(0.18) \n\n235 \n0.935 \n\n27 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 482 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Huang, Wang, and Fan \n\nREFERENCES \n\nBeck, T., A.

In  recent  years,  the  authorities  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  have \nmade  efforts  to  internationalize  its  currency  through  a  two-track  strategy:  promotion  of  the \nuse of the renminbi in the settlement of cross-border trade and investment, and liberalization \nof the capital account. We find that if we use only the quantitative measures of the economy, \nthe  predicted  share  of  the  renminbi  in  global  reserves  could  reach  12%.  However,  if \ninstitutional  and  market variables  are  included,  the  predicted  share  comes  down  to  around \n2%,  which  is  a  more  realistic  prediction.  By  reviewing  experiences  of  other  reserve \ncurrencies,  we  propose  a  three-factor  approach  for  the  PRC  authorities  to  promote  the \ninternational  role  of  the  renminbi:  (i)  increasing  the  opportunities  of  using  renminbi  in  the \ninternational  community,  which  requires  relatively  rapid  growth  of  the  PRC  economy  and \ncontinuous liberalization of trade and investment; (ii) improving the ease of using renminbi, \nwhich requires depth, sophistication, and liquidity of financial markets; and (iii) strengthening \nconfidence  of  using  renminbi,  which  requires  more  transparent  monetary  policy  making,  a \nmore independent legal system, and some political reforms. In general, we believe that the \nrenminbi\u2019s international role should increase in the coming years, but it will take a relatively \nlong period before it plays the role of a global reserve currency. \n \nJEL Classification: F30, F33, F36, F42 \n", " \n"]}
