In recent years, the authorities in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) have \nmade efforts to internationalize its currency through a two-track strategy: promotion of the \nuse of the renminbi in the settlement of cross-border trade and investment, and liberalization \nof the capital account. We find that if we use only the quantitative measures of the economy, \nthe  predicted  share  of  the  renminbi  in  global  reserves  could  reach  12%.  However,  if \ninstitutional and market variables are included, the predicted share comes down to around \n2%,  which  is  a  more  realistic  prediction.  By  reviewing  experiences  of  other  reserve \ncurrencies, we propose a three-factor approach for the PRC authorities to promote the \ninternational role of the renminbi: (i) increasing the opportunities of using renminbi in the \ninternational community, which requires relatively rapid growth of the PRC economy and \ncontinuous liberalization of trade and investment; (ii) improving the ease of using renminbi, \nwhich requires depth, sophistication, and liquidity of financial markets; and (iii) strengthening \nconfidence of using renminbi, which requires more transparent monetary policy making, a \nmore independent legal system, and some political reforms. In general, we believe that the \nrenminbi\u2019s international role should increase in the coming years, but it will take a relatively \nlong period before it plays the role of a global reserve currency. \n \nJEL Classification: F30, F33, F36, F42 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 482                                                  Huang, Wang, and Fan \nContents \n \n \n1.

INTRODUCTION \nAround mid-2008 at the height of the global financial crisis, the People\u2019s Bank of China \n(PBC) made two important decisions with regard to its currency policy: one was to \nsignificantly narrow the trading band of the renminbi\u2013US dollar exchange rate and the \nother was to promote the international use of the renminbi (RMB) in trade settlement, \nespecially trade with neighboring economies. The former was similar to what the PBC \ndid during the Asian financial crisis to stabilize investors\u2019 currency expectations. The \nlatter, however, was likely motivated by the ambition to make the RMB an international \ncurrency.  \nMany  policy  makers  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  believe  that  the \ninternational monetary system dominated by a national currency, the US dollar, is \nlogically inconsistent and unsustainable. The outbreak of the subprime crisis in the \nUnited States (US) was evidence of the problem. A possible long-term solution is to \ncreate a supranational currency, such as a revamped special drawing right (SDR) of \nthe  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  (see,  e.g.,  Zhou  2009).  In  the  short  run, \nhowever, the subprime crisis could lead to weakening demand for the US dollar and \ncreate room for the RMB to play some kind of international role. \nWhile policies to internationalize the RMB picked up pace in late 2008, the PBC\u2019s \nplanning of this effort started much earlier. In 2006, a study group of the central bank \npublished an article titled \u201cThe Timing, Path and Strategies of RMB Internationalization,\u201d \nin which it argued that \u201cthe time has come for promotion of the internationalization of \nthe  RMB\u201d  (PBC  Study  Group  2006).  The  study  group  also  suggested  that \ninternationalization  of  the  RMB  could  enhance  the  PRC\u2019s  international  status  and \ncompetitiveness and would increase the country\u2019s influence in the world economy. \nThe PRC\u2019s strategy of RMB internationalization is sometimes characterized as a two-\ntrack approach (Subacchi 2010). The first track aims at increasing the international use \nof the currency, starting with regional use for trade and investment settlement and \nestablishment of the offshore currency market in Hong Kong, China. And the second \ntrack  tackles  the  capital  account  convertibility  issue,  allowing  greater  cross-border \ncapital mobility, encouraging holding of RMB assets by nonresidents, and providing \ninstruments for hedging currency risks. In the past 5 years, the PRC authorities have \nmade significant progress in all these areas and will likely move ahead more rapidly in \nthe coming years. \nWill the RMB likely become a global reserve currency? This is the central question we \nattempt to address in this paper. To shed light on this subject, we tackle four specific \nissues  in  turn.  First,  what  has  the  PRC  accomplished  so  far  in  terms  of  RMB \ninternationalization?  Second,  what  are  the  main  obstacles  for  it  to  become  an \ninternational reserve currency? Third, what can the PRC authorities do to promote the \ninternational role of its currency? And finally, what are the implications for the PRC and \nthe world if the RMB becomes a reserve currency? In the remainder of the paper we \naddress these questions in turn and draw together the main findings of the study in the \nfinal section. \n2.  WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED? \nChinn  and  Frankel  (2005)  provide  a good  analytical  framework for  organizing  the \nPRC\u2019s  policy  efforts  in  internationalizing  its  currency  (Table  1).  An  international \ncurrency  should  possess  three  important  cross-border  functions:  store  of  value, \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 482              Huang, Wang, and Fan \nmedium of exchange, and unit of account. Each of these functions may be further \ndecomposed into public and private purposes. While Gao and Yu (2012) confirm that \nnonresidents have started using the RMB as a vehicle currency in trade and financial \nsettlement, Li and Liu (2008) sketch a promising future for it to serve as a reserve \ncurrency.  \nTable 1: International Use of the Renminbi \nFunction  Purpose  Date  Event \nStore of Value  Jul 2012  Indonesia\u2019s central bank was allowed to invest \nin the People\u2019s Republic of China interbank \nInternational reserves \nbond market \n(public) \nApr 2013  Reserve Bank of Australia plans to invest 5% \nof its foreign reserves in renminbi \nDec 2002  Provisional Measures on Administration of \nDomestic Securities Investments of Qualified \nForeign Institutional Investors \nFeb 2004  Banks in Hong Kong, China were allowed to \nCurrency substitution \nopen renminbi deposit accounts \n(private) \nJun 2007  First renminbi-denominated bond was issued \nDec 2012  Qianhai cross-border renminbi loan rules were \npublished by the People\u2019s Bank of China \nMedium of  Vehicle currency  N/A  N/A \nExchange  (public) \nJul 2009  Pilot program for renminbi settlement of cross-\nborder trade transactions \nInvoicing currency  Jan 2011  Domestic enterprises were allowed to invest \n(private)  renminbi overseas \nAug 2011  Cross-border trade settlement in renminbi was \nextended to the whole country \nUnit of Account  Anchor for pegging  N/A  N/A \n(public) \nDenominating currency  N/A  N/A \n(private) \nSource: Chinn and Frankel (2005), updated by authors. \n2.1  Public Sector and Private Sector Uses \nDue to the long-existed legal and administrative barriers, the PRC\u2019s capital market \nfeatures apparent segmentation. The nonequivalence of the offshore currency (CNH) \nmarket with the official or onshore currency (CNY) generates non-negligible benefits for \nforeign investment: while offshore equivalent instruments whose payoff is equivalent in \nmost, if not all, states of the world, investing in the onshore market could yield returns \nas much as 100\u2013150 basis points higher than the global benchmark (Maziad and Kang \n2012). As a result, RMB-denominated assets greatly appeal to foreign central banks \nthat seek high yield yet safe investment to diversify their asset portfolio. In 2010, the \nPRC began allowing foreign central banks to directly invest in its domestic interbank \nbond market without going through the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) \nprogram, which allows foreign investors to buy onshore stocks and bonds under a \nquota system. On 23 July 2012, Bank Indonesia and the PBC announced they had \nreached an agreement allowing the Indonesian central bank to invest in the PRC \ninterbank bond market. \nClearly, foreign central banks\u2019 interest in the PRC bond market is driven at least by two \nconsiderations.  One,  as  most  central  banks  with  large  foreign  exchange  reserves \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 482              Huang, Wang, and Fan \nstruggle with the only major option of investing in the US treasury market, the PRC \nbond market offers a useful option for diversification. This makes sense especially as \nthe PRC is on the way to becoming a dominant economic power in the world. And two, \nthe PRC bond market offers somewhat higher yields, compared with similar markets in \nthe developed world. It is also helped by the expectation that the onshore currency \nmarket could show a longer-term trend of appreciation. \nIn terms of functioning as a medium of exchange, the PRC started signing currency \nswap agreements with other countries under the framework of the Chiang Mai Initiative \n(CMI)  following  the  Asian  financial  crisis.  The  purpose  of  such  agreements  is  to \nimprove future financial stability by functioning as an alternative to the individually \naccumulated foreign exchange reserves, and to promote trade and investment with \nthese countries. As a result of the PRC\u2019s involvement in the buildup of the regional \nfinancial architecture, the RMB is used as a vehicle currency via the swap agreements \nand as a denominating currency in the issuance of Asian bonds under the Asian Bond \nFund II scheme.  \nThe PBC has subsequently also signed other currency swap agreements beyond the \nCMI  framework.  For  instance,  in  December  2008,  the  PRC  signed  its  first  swap \nagreement  with  the  Republic  of  Korea.  This  was  a  serious  move  by  the  PRC  in \nresponse to the widespread financial crisis. Since then, the PRC has signed swap \nagreements with central banks of 19 economies. The latest was signed between the \nPBC and the Bank of England in late June 2013 for a total of 200 billion yuan. It is \npossible  that  France  may  also  follow  the  United  Kingdom  (UK)  to  sign  such  an \nagreement with the PRC. According to our count, the total value of currency swap \nagreements is more than 2.2 trillion yuan. \nTable 2: Bilateral Swap Agreements Signed since 2008 \n  Date  Amount     Date  Amount  \n(yuan  (yuan \nbillion)  billion) \nRepublic of Korea  12 Dec 2008  180  Uzbekistan  19 Apr 2011  0.7 \n26 Oct 2011  360  Mongolia  6 May 2011  5 \nHong Kong,  20 Jan 2009  200  20 Mar 2012  10 \nChina  22 Nov 2011  400  Kazakhstan  13 Jun 2011  7 \nMalaysia  8 Feb 2009  80  Thailand  22 Dec 2011  70 \n8 Feb 2012  180  Pakistan  23 Dec 2011  10 \nBelarus  11 Mar 2009  20  United Arab Emirates  17 Jan 2012  35 \nIndonesia  23 Mar 2009  100  Turkey  21 Feb 2012  10 \nArgentina  2 Apr 2009  70  Australia  22 Mar 2012  200 \nIceland  9 Jun 2010  3.5  Ukraine  26 Jun 2012  15 \nSingapore  23 Jul 2010  150  Brazil  26 Mar 2013  190 \n7 Mar 2013  300  United Kingdom  22 Jun 2013  200 \nNew Zealand  18 Apr 2011  25  Total    2,206 \nSource: People\u2019s Bank of China.    \nAt the private level, the authorities took various steps to use the RMB for settlement of \ninternational  trade  and investment  in  order to partially  replace  traditional  invoicing \ncurrencies such as the US dollar and yen. In July 2009, the PBC and other government \ndepartments introduced the first pilot program of using RMB in the settlement of cross-\nborder  trade.  This  program  aims  at  facilitating  trade  and  investment  for  67,000 \nenterprises in 16 provinces. Two years later in August 2011, the authorities issued a \nnotice extending the geographical coverage of RMB trade settlement to the whole \ncountry.  The  PBC  issued  the  Administrative  Rules  on  RMB-denominated  Foreign \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 482              Huang, Wang, and Fan \nDirect  Investment  in  October  2011  and  announced  in  June  2012  that  all  PRC \ncompanies with an import/export license can use RMB to settle cross-border trade.  \nRMB settlement has grown very rapidly during the past years. According to PBC data, \ninternational trade and foreign direct investment settled in RMB amounted to 1 trillion \nyuan (US$161 billion) and 85.4 billion yuan (US$13.7 billion), respectively, during the \nfirst  quarter  of  2013.1 One  caveat  needs  to  be  made,  which  is  that  while  RMB \nsettlement has increased exponentially, most cross-border activities are still invoiced in \nother hard currencies such as US dollars. Therefore, the RMB is not yet being used as \na true international currency. \nThe development of the offshore currency market in Hong Kong, China made a unique \ncontribution in encouraging private nonresident holding of RMB. The offshore market \noffers a useful laboratory for strengthening RMB outbound circulation and appealing to \nnonresident investors. As early as 2004, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched \nthe RMB Business Scheme, allowing banks in Hong Kong, China to open RMB deposit \naccounts for individuals and some enterprises. However, the offshore deposit market \ndid not really take off until mid-2010 when new rules were issued to relax restrictions \non RMB activities of banks in Hong Kong, China. By March 2013, the total value of \nCNH deposits had reached 668 billion yuan (US$107 billion), almost 745 times the \nvalue of when the market was first established in February 2004 (Figure 1). In addition, \nthe number of institutions engaging in RMB business has increased to 140 from the \noriginal 32, quadrupling within less than 10 years. \nFigure 1: Renminbi Deposits in Hong Kong, China Offshore Markets, 2004\u20132013 \n160 800\nNo. of institutions engaged in renminbi business (left axis)\n140 700\nRenminbi deposits (billion yuan, right axis)\n120 600\n100 500\n80 400\n60 300\n40 200\n20 100\n0 0\nFeb-04 Aug-05 Feb-07 Aug-08 Feb-10 Aug-11 Feb-13  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority.  \nDevelopment of an offshore market for RMB-denominated bonds began in mid-2007, \nwhen selected mainland banks were permitted for the first time to raise funds by \nissuing such bonds in Hong Kong, China. The China Development Bank was the first to \nissue RMB-denominated bonds in Hong Kong, China in July 2007, while the China \nConstruction Bank became the first PRC bank to issue them in London (outside of \nHong Kong, China) in November 2012. \n                                                \n1\n See \nhttp://www.pbc.gov.cn/publish/english/955/2013/20130417083528793671703/20130417083528793671\n703_.html \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 482              Huang, Wang, and Fan \nIn 2010, bond issuance permission was extended to nonfinancial firms and foreign \nmultinationals doing business in the PRC. McDonald\u2019s, the well-known fast food chain \nstore, and Caterpillar, the US-based maker of construction equipment, were among the \nfirst group of foreign companies to tap into the \u201cdim sum\u201d bond market. HSBC became \nthe first non-Hong Kong, China institution to issue RMB bonds in London in April 2012. \nDespite its short history, the size of the offshore bond market has expanded rapidly \nsince 2012, with continuous relaxation of restrictions imposed by PRC regulators and \nstrong expectations of RMB appreciation. \nSome foreign central banks have started to hold RMB as part of their foreign reserves, \nas  the  international  significance  of  the  currency  increases  rapidly.  This  activity, \nhowever, remains primitive, mainly because the currency is not yet convertible under \nthe  capital  account  and  internationally  available  RMB-denominated  assets  remain \nscarce. One recent significant step was in June 2013 when the Reserve Bank of \nAustralia decided to invest up to 5% of its foreign reserves in RMB, which should be \nequivalent to A$2 billion according to the bank\u2019s current size of foreign reserves. \n2.2  Is the Renminbi Already a De Facto Anchor for Regional \nCurrencies? \nEconomists have long argued that there are some fundamental factors driving implicit \nor explicit regional currency arrangements in Asia (Kawai 2002). The US dollar has in \nthe past been the most significant anchor currency for the region, although in the last \ndecade of the 20th century the yen also played an important role for some regional \ncurrencies  such  as  the  won  and  the  NT  dollar.  Given  the  PRC\u2019s  capital  account \ncontrols  and  inflexibility  of  the  RMB  exchange  rate,  there  is  not  yet  an  explicit \narrangement  linking  foreign  exchange  rates  to  the  RMB.  However,  Ito  (2008) \nsuggested that, implicitly, the RMB was probably already serving as one of the anchors \nfor regional currencies. \nTo assess this possibility, especially with respect to changes over time, we conduct \nsome  statistical  analyses  by  applying  the  framework  of  Frankel  and  Wei  (1994). \nSpecifically, the following model is estimated: \n \nOn\u2206 \ud835\udc52t\ud835\udc34h\ud835\udc60e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc5ble\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc62ft\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc5fi\ud835\udc52s\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc50th\ud835\udc66/e\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc37d\ud835\udc45e=pe\ud835\udefcn0de+n\ud835\udefct 1v\u2206a\ud835\udc52r\ud835\udc48ia\ud835\udc46b\ud835\udc37l/e\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37, \ud835\udc45w+hic\ud835\udefch2 \u2206is\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc38 t\ud835\udc48h\ud835\udc45e/\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc37d\ud835\udc45ai+ly \ud835\udefcr3e\u2206tu\ud835\udc52r\ud835\udc3dn\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc4co/\ud835\udc46f\ud835\udc37 e\ud835\udc45x+ch\ud835\udefca4n\u2206g\ud835\udc52e\ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc41r\ud835\udc4ca/t\ud835\udc46e\ud835\udc37s\ud835\udc45 .of \nAsian economies. At the same time, the daily return of the US dollar, the euro, the yen, \nand the RMB are placed on the right side of the equation as explanatory variables. All \nthe  exchange  rates  are  expressed  relative  to  the  IMF\u2019s  SDR,  as  suggested  by \nFratzscher and Mehl (2011). Moreover, to ensure that all the factors are exogenous \nand circumvent the potential multi-collinearity arising from the fact that the RMB is to \nsome extent pegged to the US dollar, the RMB factor is orthogonalized with respect to \nthe US dollar factor by regressing the former on the latter and taking the residuals as \nthe new explanatory factor.2 \nAll daily data are drawn from the IMF database for the period between 1 January 1999 \nand 10 June 2013. In the empirical estimation, we use the date of the exchange rate \npolicy reform on 21 July 2005 dividing the whole sample period into two subperiods.  \nEstimation results using pre-reform data confirm that the exchange rates of all seven \nAsian currencies are significantly influenced by the US dollar (top half of Table 3). \n                                                \n2\n The following empirical findings hold when conducting a similar auxiliary regression on the euro and yen. \nThe results are available upon request from the authors.  \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 482              Huang, Wang, and Fan \nAmong them, the Hong Kong dollar and the ringgit are strict dollar pegs. The Indian \nrupee, the rupiah, and the won are heavily impacted by the US dollar with a weight of \nmore  than  0.85. The  US  dollar\u2019s  influence  on the  Singapore  dollar  and  the  baht, \nhowever, is slightly smaller, with a weight of around 0.55\u20130.65. Influences of the yen \nare noticeably smaller but present in a number of cases, such as the Singapore dollar \nand the baht. The euro does not have a noticeable effect and the RMB asserts no \nsignificant influence on other Asian currencies. \nThe story changed significantly after the July 2005 exchange rate reform (bottom half \nof Table 3). The overall impacts of the US dollar, the yen, and the euro are similar to \nthose before July 2005. Yet, the RMB shows important influences on its neighbors\u2019 \ncurrencies. Specifically, while the US dollar seems to dominate in the case of the Hong \nKong dollar, the won, and the baht, the RMB affects the Indian rupee, the rupiah, the \nringgit, and the Singapore dollar more, though this finding is still slightly odd given that \nit is not yet fully convertible and the exchange rate is not yet freely floating. It is, \nnonetheless, consistent with the fact that Asian central banks pay close attention to the \nmovement of the RMB exchange rate. \nTable 3: Asian Currency Regimes with Rise of the Renminbi \nHong \nKong  Indian  Singapore \n  dollar  Rupiah  rupee  Won  Ringgit  dollar  Baht \nBefore the Renminbi Reform (1 Jan 1999\u201320 Jul 2005) \nUS dollar  0.994***  0.858***  0.875***  0.978***  1.000***  0.570***  0.619*** \n  (0.0162)  (0.0737)  (0.091)  (0.235)  (0.0002)  (0.0954)  (0.177) \nEuro  0.0103  0.0309**  0.197  0.0192  \u20133.83E-05*  \u20130.0185  \u20130.0133 \n  (0.0116)  (0.0144)  (0.136)  (0.0388)  (2.32E-05)  (0.0195)  (0.0354) \nYen  0.00996*  0.0150*  0.243***  0.0317  \u20135.2E-06  0.171***  0.164*** \n  (0.00555)  (0.00876)  (0.0732)  (0.0232)  (1.3E-04)  (0.0133)  (0.0231) \nYuan  0.00555  0.00139  1.913  0.144  0.0066  1.452  1.244 \n  (0.0348)  (0.00155)  (2.111)  (0.515)  (0.00417)  (2.033)  (3.888) \nConstant  \u20134.2E-04  5.06E-05  0.00128  3.03E-04  5.08E-07  0.000133  \u20135.6E-05 \n  (2.74E-04)  (1.18E-04)  (1.7E-03)  (4.09E-04)  (3.28E-07)  (1.67E-04)  (3.0E-04) \nObservations  1,340  1,205  1,089  1,026  1,348  1,286  1,108 \nR-squared  0.951  0.738  0.131  0.4  0.99  0.502  0.368 \nAfter the Reform (20 Jul 2005\u201310 Jun 2013) \nUS dollar  0.966***  0.673***  0.714***  0.919***  0.717***  0.592***  0.836*** \n  (0.0106)  (0.0725)  (0.104)  (0.114)  (0.0489)  (0.0406)  (0.0369) \nEuro  0.00119  0.0677  \u20130.0216  \u20130.15  0.0595  0.0792**  \u20130.0471 \n  (0.0072)  (0.0608)  (0.0638)  (0.117)  (0.0408)  (0.0342)  (0.0301) \nYen  \u20130.00215  \u20130.205***  \u20130.248***  \u20130.0186  \u20130.127***  \u20130.0593***  \u20130.00608 \n  (0.00359)  (0.0253)  (0.0511)  (0.0623)  (0.018)  (0.0151)  (0.0149) \nYuan  0.0403**  0.749***  0.954***  0.526**  1.227***  1.185***  0.444*** \n  (0.018)  (0.163)  (0.177)  (0.229)  (0.136)  (0.111)  (0.126) \nConstant  \u20134.3E-06  \u20133.18E-04**  \u20131.7E-04  \u20132.9E-04  \u20135.8E-05  1.94E-05  2.57E-05 \n  (1.63E-05)  (1.27E-04)  (2.17E-04)  (1.93E-04)  (9.20E-05)  (7.51E-05)  (8.24E-05) \nObservations  1,525  1,382  1,453  1,489  1,457  1,526  1,329 \nR-squared  0.957  0.186  0.09  0.164  0.286  0.26  0.468 \nSource: International Monetary Fund International Financial Statistics, CEIC. \nRecently, however, Kawai and Pontines (2014) challenged the validity of the above \ntype of exercise by arguing that there could be a serious multi-collinearity problem \nbetween the US dollar and RMB exchange rates (as indicated above, our analyses first \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 482              Huang, Wang, and Fan \ntake out the influences of the US dollar exchange rate on the RMB and then use the \nresidual of the RMB exchange rate to estimate its influence on Asian currencies). By \nproposing and applying a new two-step estimation method, they found that, while the \nRMB\u2019s influence was on the rise, there was not yet a RMB bloc in East Asia (Kawai \nand Pontines 2014). Therefore, this issue needs to be explored further. \n2.3  Summary \nTo sum up, within a relatively short period, the PRC authorities have made meaningful \nprogress in internationalizing the country\u2019s currency. The amount of international trade \nand direct investment settled in RMB is growing very rapidly. RMB deposits have \nalready reached a relatively high level in Hong Kong, China and are growing quickly in \nother markets. RMB-denominated assets, mainly bonds, are already on offer both in \nHong  Kong,  China  and  London.  In  addition  to  large  volumes  of  currency  swap \nagreements, some foreign central banks have also started holding RMB as part of their \nforeign exchange reserves. The RMB even asserts important influences on exchange \nrates of some other Asian currencies. \nAssessing such progress in the framework proposed by Chinn and Frankel (2005), we \nfind  that  RMB  internationalization  has  advanced  most  remarkably  in  its  use  as  a \nmedium of exchange for both the public and private sectors. International functions lag \nmost clearly as a unit of account for the private sector and store of value for the public \nsector. The significant achievements are attributable to two important factors: one is \nthe relative decline of the US dollar following the global financial crisis and therefore \nnew  demand  for  an  alternative  international  currency;  and  the  other  is  the  PRC \ngovernment\u2019s well planned and well executed policies. Some even argue that the main \ndriving force behind the impressive growth of the offshore RMB market is the strongly \nheld view that the RMB would inevitably and substantially appreciate against other \nmajor  currencies.  In  other  words,  speculative  desire  has  overwhelmed  other \nfundamental  demand,  such  as  risk  hedging,  in  driving  the  growth  of  the  offshore \ncurrency market (Garber 2011). \n3.  WHAT ARE THE MAIN OBSTACLES? \nDespite the progress the PRC authorities made in internationalizing the currency, the \nRMB is not yet an international currency. Is it realistic for it to become an international \ncurrency in the perceivable future? Academic assessment may lead to very different \nconclusions. Some may suggest that given the PRC is already the world\u2019s second \nlargest economy and one of the most important global trading partners, it is a matter of \ntime for the RMB to ascend to international currency status. Meanwhile, others may \nargue that it is very hard for the international market to accept the RMB as a global \ncurrency  due  to  the  PRC\u2019s  primitive  financial  markets,  unique  monetary  policy \nmechanism, capital account controls, and underdeveloped legal system. \n3.1  Brief Review of International Experiences \nWhat are the main obstacles for the RMB to become an international currency? We try \nto shed some light on this question. First, we take a brief look at the rise of the US \ndollar, the deutsche mark, the yen, and the euro to global reserve currency status and \ndraw some simple lessons. Second, we adopt some quantitative methods to identify \nkey determinants of the shares of existing international currencies in global currency \nreserves. The estimation results are then applied to predict the likely shares of the \n9 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 482              Huang, Wang, and Fan \nRMB under different sets of assumptions. One key message appears to be clear and \nconsistent:  size  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and  size  of  trade  are  only  a \nnecessary condition, but quality of markets, policies, and institutions are by far more \nimportant for producing international currencies. \nDuring the 20th century, three national currencies rose to international currency status: \nthe US dollar in the first half of the century, and the deutsche mark and the yen over \nthe two decades following the 1971\u20131973 collapse of the Bretton Woods system. The \nfirst decade of the 21st century witnessed the ascendancy of a supranational currency: \nthe euro. By looking at the circumstances in which each of the currencies became an \ninternational  currency,  we  may  be  able  to  draw  some  useful  lessons  for  the \ninternationalization of the RMB. \nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the pound sterling reigned supreme. Although the \nUS was already the largest economy of the world, its currency was still a relatively \nunimportant currency in global financial markets. In retrospect, the main reason the US \ndollar did not rule the world economy before World War I was its lack of a deep, liquid, \nand open financial market. Another important reason was the absence of a credible \ncentral bank, which is often considered a prerequisite for development of financial \nmarkets and financial instruments (Frankel 2011). These reasons suggest that while \nsize of the economy is an important condition for creating an international currency, it is \nfar from a sufficient condition. \nThe  situation  changed  in  1913  when  President  Woodrow  Wilson  ratified  the \nestablishment of the Federal Reserve and the onset of World War I accelerated the US \ndollar\u2019s  rise.  Large-scale  wartime  lending  by  the  US  to  Britain reversed  the  long-\nestablished  creditor\u2013debtor  relationship,  positioning  the  dollar  as  a  strong  global \ncurrency. Even though the pound sterling made a slight comeback later in the 1930s \nafter the Great Depression, by 1944 the dollar had sealed its crown position through \nthe establishment of the Bretton Woods system. The new position of the US dollar \nrelative to the pound sterling was also clearly reflected in the composition of foreign-\nowned liquid assets around that time. During the past decade, the dollar\u2019s share in \ninternational reserves have trended down gradually but stayed above 60% (Figure 2). \nFigure 2: Currency Composition of Official Foreign Reserves \n30% 80%\n70%\n25%\n60%\n20%\n50%\n15% 40%\nEuro Yen\nSwiss franc Pound sterling 30%\n10% US dollar (right axis)\n20%\n5%\n10%\n0% 0%\n1999-Q1 2002-Q1 2005-Q1 2008-Q1 2011-Q1\n \nSource: International Monetary Fund Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER) \ndatabase. \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 482              Huang, Wang, and Fan \nThe deutsche mark was born in Ludwig Erhard\u2019s currency reform in 1948, but its \ncentral bank, the Bundesbank, was not founded until 1957. Despite its short history, the \nmark continued to gain status throughout the 1980s. The main contributor to this was \nthe growing size of the German economy and the impeccable reputation that the \nBundesbank established in keeping the value of the mark strong. In 1989, the deutsche \nmark  saw  its  peak  performance  in  the  international  monetary  system  when  the \ncurrency reached almost 20% of world foreign exchange reserves. Following that peak, \nthe deutsche mark started a long journey of decline due to slowdown of the economy \nand collapse of the Berlin Wall. The Maastricht Treaty signed in 1992 came to fruition \nin January 1999 and the deutsche mark, together with the French franc and nine other \ncontinental currencies, went out of existence in the historic creation of the euro. \nThe story of the rise of the yen began as Japan\u2019s export-driven economic miracle \nallowed its currency to meet the first criterion for internationalization: the country\u2019s \neconomic weight. After the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1973, central \nbanks around the world began to hold yen as a substitute foreign exchange reserve. \nNevertheless,  since  Japanese  financial  markets  remained  uncompetitive,  highly \nregulated, and mostly closed to foreigners, the actual extent of yen internationalization \nwas low. International use of the yen accelerated in the late 1980s and the share of \nworld foreign exchange reserves denominated in yen reached its peak at 9% in 1991. \nSince the bursting of the real estate and equity bubbles at the start of the 1990s, the \ncountry slowly yet painfully fell into a long-lasting spiral recession. By the end of 2003, \nit became clear that any further attempt to internationalize the yen would be futile \nwithout a fundamental change in the economic might of Japan (Takagi 2011). \n \nAt the end of the 20th century, a supranational regional currency came into existence. \nThe  motivation  of  creating  the  euro  was  mainly  political:  it  was  deemed  as  an \nindispensable step toward realizing the ambition of a united Europe. Naturally the euro \nstarted with two advantages: it was the home currency for a bloc that resembled the \nUS in terms of economic scale and it seemed likely to inherit the credibility of the \ndeutsche mark. As a result, it advanced quickly into the ranks of the top reserve \ncurrencies in its first decade and was expected to pose a challenge to the long global \nsupremacy of the greenback.3 \n \nExperiences  of the  dollar,  deutsche mark,  yen,  and  euro  suggest  that to  assume \ninternational status, a currency needs to be supported by at least three key factors: the \nscale  of  the  economy,  which  leads  to  the  extensiveness  of  the  issuing  country\u2019s \ntransactional networks (Eichengreen 2005); the stability of the currency value, which is \nbelieved to be linked to sound macroeconomic fundamentals in the issuing country \n(Chen, Peng, and Shu 2009); and the existence of well-developed and open financial \nmarkets, which guarantees the liquidity and convertibility of the currency (Cohen 2007). \nHowever, these may still not be sufficient. As Helleiner (2008) suggested, confidence \nand power in a currency may derive not only from economic fundamentals, but also \nfrom the social institutions. Further, as Krugman (1984) noted, there is a kind of circular \ncausation  encouraging  a  leading  international  currency  to  become  even  more \nprominent over time since people find benefits in using a currency that is used by \nothers. \n                                                \n3\n Whether the euro will displace the US dollar as the main international currency is far from unambiguous. \nSee Kenen (2002), Chinn and Frankel (2008), and McNamara (2008) for a detailed discussion. \n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 482              Huang, Wang, and Fan \n3.2  Determinants of Currency Shares in Global Reserves \nTo verify the above suggestions and illustrate the importance of the various factors for \nRMB  internationalization,  we  apply  a  quantitative  framework  to  identify  the \ndeterminants of shares of individual currencies in total global reserve holdings, using \ndata of existing reserve currencies. Potential explanatory variables include scale of the \neconomy, stability of the currency, and development of financial markets and social \ninstitutions. After estimation of the model using data for existing international reserve \ncurrencies, we also carry out a series of counterfactual exercises to identify some of \nthe main obstacles for the RMB in becoming a reserve currency. \nThere are several studies in the literature looking at the same question. Previous \nmodels, such as those adopted by Chen, Peng, and Shu (2009) and Li and Liu (2008), \nconsidered the three traditional economic fundamentals in determining currency shares \nin global foreign reserve holdings. This is a reasonable exercise as they reveal the \npotential that the PRC could realize by looking at only the three basic (quantitative) \nvariables. However, Lee (2010) showed that adding a capital account liberalization \nindex to the model could generate different results. By adding policy and institutional \nvariables to the model, we may be able to see how restrictive these variables are for \nthe PRC\u2019s reserve currency ambition. At the same time, empirical results including \npolicy and institutional variables may also shed light on where the authorities should \ndirect their key reform efforts. \nIn  this  study,  we  intend  to  include  a  series  of  potential  determining  variables  for \ncurrency shares in global foreign reserves. We start with the basic model including only \nthe  most  commonly  used  variables,  mostly  quantitative  measures.  We  will  then \nestimate several additional models by including new variables, mostly qualitative or \ninstitutional variables. The logic of doing this is simple: most studies examine the \nRMB\u2019s potential share in global foreign reserves by looking only at the size of the PRC \neconomy. While this is useful, most economies in the world never reach their potential \nbecause of institutional deficiencies. For instance, the currency share will not rise \nalongside  economic  growth  if  the  currency  is  not  convertible.  By  estimating  the \npotentials  with  the  policy  and  institutional  variables,  we  are  able  to  tell  what  is \npractically achievable under the current policy and institutional setting. At the same \ntime, comparison of different potential estimates can also tell what can be done to \nincrease the RMB\u2019s share in global currency reserves. \nThe currencies identified in the IMF Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange \nReserves (COFER) database are the US dollar, euro, pound sterling, yen, Swiss franc, \nand a category of all other currencies. Because some member countries choose not to \nreport the currency compositions of their foreign reserves, the model below takes the \ncurrency composition of the allocated reserves (about 70% of total reserves) as the \ndependent variable representing the reserve currency share.  \nWe use quarterly data for the period 1999\u20132011 because data before January 1999 do \nnot cover the euro. An economy\u2019s GDP and trade share in the world are included to \ntackle the impact of the scale of the economy. Inflation differential (vis-\u00e0-vis OECD \naverage  inflation)  and  exchange  rate  volatility  (3-year  monthly  average,  national \ncurrency vis-\u00e0-vis the SDR) are added to the model to capture features of the stability \nof the currency. The stock market capitalization as a share of five major financial \ncenters (New York, London, Tokyo, Euronext, and Zurich) combined and the ratio of \nsuch a capitalization level to GDP are derived to reflect the development of financial \nmarkets. Data on stock market capitalization are obtained from the World Federation of \n12 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 482              Huang, Wang, and Fan \nExchanges, while the others are obtained from the IMF International Financial Statistics \nand CEIC. \nWe use currency appreciation to proxy market participants\u2019 implicit demand for the \ncurrency.4 As suggested by Li and Liu (2008), long-term appreciation would also be \nhelpful for  achieving the  \u201cstore  of  value\u201d function  of  an  international currency. To \nmeasure  the  extent  of  capital  account  liberalization,  previous  researchers  have \nproposed  two  distinct  approaches.  The  de  jure  approach  is  based  on  legislative \nrestrictions (Chinn and Ito 2008), while the de facto one is often constructed as the \nratio of gross cross-border capital stock to GDP (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti 2007). Since \nthe quarterly data are employed, the more refined de facto index is a better fit. The \nindicator  introduced  to  describe  the  overall  institution  is  adopted  from  Economic \nFreedom of the World: 2012 Annual Report by the Fraser Institute. Economic freedom \nis  a  composite  index  constructed  from  42  variables  in  5  broad  areas:  size  of \ngovernment,  legal  system  and  property  rights,  sound  money,  freedom  to  trade \ninternationally, and regulation.5 \nThe following model specification is adopted in empirical estimation: \nshare =\u03b1 +\u03b2GDP +\u03b2Trade +\u03b2MktCap +\u03b2Inf +\u03b2FXV\nit 1 1 it 2 it 3 it 4 it 5 it\n \n+\u03b3FXA +\u03b3KALib +\u03b3MktGDP +\u03b3Institution +\u03b3share +\u03b5\n1 it 2 it 3 it 4 it 5 i,t\u22121 it\nwhere GDP is the country\u2019s share in global GDP, Trade is the country\u2019s share in global \ntrade, MktCap is total market capitalization, Inf is inflation differential vis-\u00e0-vis the \nOECD average, FXV is exchange rate volatility, FXA is currency appreciation, KALib is \ncapital account liberalization index, MktGDP is market capitalization relative to GDP, \nand Institution is the economic freedom index. A one-period lag of the dependent \nvariable is also added to control for the inertia of international currency choice as \n6\nsuggested by Krugman (1984).  Table 4 provides some statistical characteristics of the \ndata set. \n                                                \n4\n Currencies used in the first-stage estimation are all from developed economies (eurozone, Japan, \nSwitzerland, UK, and US). The movement of the exchange rate is generally determined by market force. \n5\n Due to data availability, the economic freedom index ends at the end of 2010.

Model (1), the basic model, replicates previous \nexercises, such as those by Chinn and Frankel (2005) and Chen, Peng, and Shu \n(2009). It is not surprising that the size of GDP and that of the financial market are very \nimportant in determining the currency share in global reserve holdings.

Model (3) further includes currency appreciation in \nthe model, which reflects implicit demand for the currency. Model (4) adds the capital \naccount liberalization index, which really is a prerequisite for international currency \nholding. And finally, Model (5) includes the economic freedom indicator to control the \nimpact of a broad range of policies and institutions.  \n14 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 482              Huang, Wang, and Fan \nTable 5: Panel Regressions of Determination of Currency Shares \nDependent Variable: currency share in global reserves \nExplanatory Variables \n(1)  (2)  (3)  (4)  (5) \nGDP share  0.145**  0.146**  0.0964*  0.0945*  0.103* \n(0.0576)  (0.0576)  (0.0523)  (0.052)  (0.0523) \nTrade  share  0.146***  0.156***  0.0975**  0.100**  0.092* \n  (0.0491)  (0.051)  (0.046)  (0.0464)  (0.052) \nInflation  \u20130.0664  \u20130.0612  \u20130.0364  \u20130.0513  \u20130.0133 \n  (0.086)  (0.086)  (0.0778)  (0.0776)  (0.0871) \nExchange rate volatility  0.0856  0.0991  0.0378  0.0666  0.121 \n  (0.0726)  (0.075)  (0.0657)  (0.0677)  (0.0811) \nMkt_Cap  0.0349*  0.0327*  0.0193  0.0248  0.0169 \n  (0.0203)  (0.0195)  (0.0185)  (0.0186)  (0.0194) \nMkt_Cap/GDP    0.00112  0.00137  0.000802  0.000862 \n    (0.00156)  (0.0014)  (0.00142)  (0.0014) \nAppreciation    0.0673***  0.0672***  0.0674*** \n \n  (0.00886)  (0.0088)  (0.0093) \n \nCapital accoun t liberalization        0.00631**  0.00849** \n        (0.00311)  (0.0036) \nEconomic freedom          0.0043* \n          (0.0025) \nLag of share  0.898***  0.897***  0.925***  0.907***  0.891*** \n  (0.0198)  (0.0198)  (0.0182)  (0.0202)  (0.0265) \nConstant  \u20130.0151**  \u20130.0172***  \u20130.0093***  \u20130.0141**  \u20130.048** \n  (0.00355)  (0.00370)  (0.00166)  (0.00698)  (0.0226) \nObservation  255  255  255  255  235 \nR-squared  0.948  0.948  0.958  0.959  0.958 \nGDP = gross domestic product, Mkt_Cap = market capitalization.  \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \nThe general findings are that size matters. A country\u2019s GDP and trade shares in the \nworld play very important roles in determining its currency share in global currency \nreserves. Currency appreciation, capital account liberalization, and economic freedom \nare also quite important in affecting the currency share. However, coefficient estimates \nof other variables such as inflation volatility and financial market capitalization are not \nsignificant in the estimated models. We suspect that these are mainly results of a data \nquality  problem.  For  instance,  market  capitalization  is  probably  not  an  accurate \nrepresentative of the actual degree of financial market development. In the appendix, \nwe report results from various robustness checks to validate our findings.   \nHaving obtained the results, we then predict the likely share of the RMB in global \ncurrency reserves. We assume the share to be zero in the first quarter of 1999 and \nthen apply estimated parameters and actual values of the independent variables for the \nPRC  to  predict  the  RMB\u2019s  share.  Since  the  share  of  currency  in  foreign  reserve \nholdings is nonnegative, during the recursive process one should always choose the \nmaximum of zero and the predicted value. The predicted RMB shares at the end of \n2011 are 10.1% under Model (1), 8.9% under Model (2), 5.3% under Model (3), 6.8% \nunder  Model  (4),  and  2.2%  under  Model  (5).  In  general,  the  more  policy  and \ninstitutional variables are included in estimation, the lower the estimated share for the \nRMB in global currency reserves. \n15 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 482              Huang, Wang, and Fan \nComparison of these predictions also reinforces one of our important arguments\u2014the \npredicted potentials simply based on quantitative measures are probably too optimistic \n(Figure 3). For instance, if we just look at the PRC\u2019s GDP and trade shares in the \nworld,  the  RMB\u2019s  share  should  be around  10%. This  is  possible  if all  policy  and \ninstitutions in the PRC are similar to those in the US and other developed countries. \nYet,  we  know  this  is  not  true.  If  we  take  into  account  several  important  policy \nconsiderations and institutions, such as capital account liberalization and economic \nfreedom, then RMB\u2019s actual potential share comes down to only around 2%. However, \nwe think this last number makes sense because (i) it tells us what the PRC can \nrealistically achieve now and (ii) what reform actions the PRC needs to undertake in \norder to realize the 10% potential. \nFigure 3: Counterfactual Exercise\u2014Linear Models \n12%\nModel (1)\n10%\nModel (2)\nModel (3)\n8%\nModel (4)\nModel (5)\n6%\n4%\n2%\n0%\n2005-Q1 2006-Q1 2007-Q1 2008-Q1 2009-Q1 2010-Q1 2011-Q1\n    \nNote: Models (1)\u2013(5) are consistent with those models reported in Table 2. \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \n3.3  Summary \nBased on the above analyses, we propose three sets of factors that are critical for \nproducing an international currency: (i) economic weights, (ii) openness and depth of \nfinancial markets, (iii) and credibility of economic and legal systems. Comparing the \nPRC\u2019s situation using these criteria may suggest that while the RMB\u2019s international role \nis likely to rise in the coming years, it would be difficult for it to become a global reserve \ncurrency anytime soon. \nThe first factor should create more chances of using a country\u2019s own currency in \ninternational transactions. It is useful to note, however, that while economic weights are \nimportant, they are perhaps not the most fundamental factors. The Swiss franc is an \ninternational currency, although the size of the Swiss economy is relatively small. \nConversely, the US dollar did not become a global currency before World War I when \nthe US economy was already bigger than the economies of the United Kingdom, \nGermany, and France combined. Nonetheless, the PRC\u2019s rising importance in global \nGDP and trade has already generated some demand for the RMB as a settlement \ncurrency.  It  is  not  too  difficult  to  imagine  such  demand  rise  rapidly  as  the  PRC \nbecomes the largest economy in the world over the coming decade. \nThe second factor determines how easily nonresidents can access the currency, make \nan investment, liquidate it, and hedge the risk. The yen provides a good case. For \n16 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 482              Huang, Wang, and Fan \ndecades, Japan was the world\u2019s second largest economy and the size of its financial \nmarkets was phenomenal. However, the role of the yen as an international currency \npeaked in the late 1980s. This was partly because the Japanese economy entered a \nlong period of stagnation. More fundamentally, however, it was due to the fact that the \nJapanese  financial  markets  are  not  really  open  to  foreign  investors.  With  capital \naccount controls and primitive financial markets, the PRC lags significantly in this area \nbefore the RMB can truly become an international currency. \nAnd the third factor underscores investor confidence in the currency by supporting \ncurrency, financial, economic, and even political stability. It is perhaps no coincidence \nthat all existing global reserve currencies are from developed economies. And the US \ndollar did not rise to international currency status until after the establishment of the \nFederal Reserve System. This is probably the most difficult area for the PRC to catch \nup. The gaps between the PRC and those existing international currency countries in \nthe five categories of the economic freedom index discussed are very wide, especially \nin the legal system and property rights, sound money, and regulation. \n4.  WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE? \nThe key challenge facing the PBC and other PRC authorities now is how to raise the \nRMB\u2019s potential share in global reserves from 2% identified by Model (5) to 10% \nidentified  by  Model  (1)  and  even  higher  levels  in  the future. The main  difference \nbetween the two model specifications is a set of policy and institutional gaps.  \nThe PBC has adopted a two-track approach in internationalizing the RMB: one is to \npromote the international use of the RMB and the other is to liberalize the capital \naccount  (PBC  Study  Group  2006).  We  may  regard  the  first  track  as  facilitating \nnonresidents to use and hold RMB and the second as creating demand for RMB by \nnonresidents. The first-track strategies are important because a currency becomes an \ninternational currency only if nonresidents use it, but the second-track strategies are \nmore critical\u2014the US dollar has been the global currency mainly because of the strong \nUS economy, its efficient and liquid market, and its sound legal system. \nMost of the authorities\u2019 recent policy actions are related to the first track. These include \nuse of the RMB in trade and investment settlement, setting up of offshore markets, \nissuance of RMB-denominated securities products overseas, and holding of RMB as \npart of foreign central banks\u2019 currency reserves, etc. These efforts should continue. \nThe authorities may even take further steps to encourage nonresidents to hold RMB. \nOne such possible step is to add RMB to the IMF\u2019s SDR basket and another is to \npromote intraregional cross-holding of reserve currencies as proposed by Fan, Wang, \nand Huang (2013). \nThe SDR was first established in 1969 as a supplement to the US dollar as a source of \ninternational liquidity (Williamson 2009), but it is only an imperfect reserve asset since it \ndoes not allow accomplishment of functions such as market intervention and liquidity \nprovision  (IMF  2011).  The  SDR  basket  currently  consists  of  four  major  global \ncurrencies only (Table 6). Adding the RMB to the basket would not only make it a part \nof the global reserve assets but also significantly increase its global profile. The IMF \nwas initially reluctant about the idea of including the RMB in the SDR basket but now \nsuggests that \u201crecent reforms that allow nonresidents, including central banks, to hold \nRMB-denominated deposits \u2026 could contribute, over time, to resolving some of the \ntechnical difficulties in hedging RMB exposure\u201d (IMF 2011, 20).  \n17 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 482              Huang, Wang, and Fan \nTable 6: Official Special Drawing Right Weights (%) \n  1990  1995  1998  2000  2005  2010 \nUS dollar  40  39  39  45  44  41.9 \nDeutsche mark  21  21         \nFrench franc  11  11         \nEuro      32  29  34  37.4 \nYen  17  18  18  15  11  9.4 \nPound sterling  11  11  11  11  11  11.3 \nTotal  100  100  100  100  100  100 \nSource: International Monetary Fund Special Drawing Right Statistics. \nFan  and  his  collaborators  made  a  proposal  in  2010  to  establish  an  intraregional \nmechanism  for  cross-holding  of  reserve  currencies  (see  Fan,  Wang,  and  Huang \n2013).7 The key idea is for governments in Asia to reach bilateral agreements in \nholding each other\u2019s currencies as part of their foreign reserves. Weights of such \ncurrency holdings may be determined by shares of their bilateral trade in total trade. \nThis  arrangement  has  some  similarities  to  currency  swap  agreements,  which  are \nmainly a crisis response mechanism (although sometimes also used as a means to \npromote  trade  and  investment),  while  cross-reserve  holdings  are  part  of  regular \noperations. It immediately makes regional currencies available as reserve currencies, \nopens government bond markets to each other, and also encourages parties involved \nto monitor others\u2019 macroeconomic and policy development. \nOur  view,  however,  is that  whether  or  not  the  RMB  can  become  an  international \ncurrency will fundamentally be determined by the broadly defined second track of the \nPBC. The PRC can encourage nonresidents to hold RMB, but it will not last if it does \nnot  possess  the  essential  qualities  of  an  international  currency.  For  instance,  the \namount  of  offshore  RMB  deposits  often  fluctuates  alongside  changes  in  currency \nexpectation. We now discuss some of the important reforms that could underscore \nthese three factors. \n4.1  Economic Weights \nSo far the hope for the RMB to become an international currency is mainly driven by \nthe rapid rise of the economy. During the first 30 years of economic reform, the PRC \nmaintained an average GDP growth rate of 10%. By the end of 2010, it had already \nsurpassed  Japan  to  become  the  world\u2019s  second  largest  economy.  The  general \nexpectation  is  that,  if  the  strong growth momentum  continues, the  PRC  will  likely \novertake the US to become the largest economy in the world within the next 10 years. \nGrowth sustainability should be one of the fundamental factors supporting a rising \nRMB. The declining international role of the yen in the 1990s as its economy fell into \nstagnation offers an important lesson for the PRC. \nHowever, the sustainability of the country\u2019s growth could be a big question mark. \nDespite  its  strong  growth  performance,  economists  and  officials  have  long  been \nworried about its growth model. Former Premier Wen Jiabao once pointed out that the \n8\nPRC  growth  model  is  \u201cunstable,  unbalanced,  uncoordinated  and  unsustainable.\u201d  \nSome  of  the  key  structural  problems  frequently  discussed  include  unusually  high \n                                                \n7\n This paper was first completed in 2010 as a project report for the PRC Center for International Economic \nExchange  (CCIEE).  It  was  presented  at  the  ADBI/CCIEE  joint  workshop  on  regional  currency \ncooperation in November 2010.  \n8\n See http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-03/16/content_5856569.htm \n18 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 482              Huang, Wang, and Fan \ninvestment share of GDP, heavy dependency on resource consumption, large current \naccount surplus, unequal income distribution, and serious pollution. The IMF\u2019s latest \nreport on Article IV consultation also confirmed the international community\u2019s worry \nabout the PRC\u2019s structural problems (IMF 2013). \nSo what lies behind the PRC\u2019s unique growth model with strong economic growth but \nserious  structural  imbalances?  One  explanation  is  the  so-called  \u201casymmetric \nliberalization of the market.\u201d On the one hand, product markets have almost been \ncompletely liberalized; on the other, distortions in factor markets have remained broad \nand serious. In general, such policy distortions depressed costs of labor, land, energy, \ncapital, and water, subsidized owners of the endowments (e.g., producers, investors, \nand  exporters),  and  literally  functioned  at  the  cost  of  households.  This  special \nmechanism redistributing income from households to enterprises was the key reason \neconomic growth was unusually strong but the economic structure became increasingly \nimbalanced (Huang 2010; Huang and Tao 2010; Huang and Wang 2010). \nThe good news is that rebalancing of the PRC economy is already under way. There \nare at least three pieces of evidence supporting this claim (Huang et al. 2013): One, \nthe current account surplus has already narrowed from 10.8% of GDP in 2007 to below \n3.0% in recent years. This is the reason some officials argue that the RMB exchange \nrate is now close to equilibrium. Two, recent studies suggest that shares of total and \nhousehold consumption in GDP started to pick up after 2007 and 2008 (Huang et al. \n2013).  And  three,  official  estimates  of  the  Gini  coefficient  point  to  continued \nimprovement in income distribution among households after 2008.  \nSo far, improvements have been mainly triggered by the rapid rise of wages as a result \nof the emerging labor shortage problem in the PRC (Figure 4). Rapidly growing wages \nsqueeze  corporate  profits  and  therefore  slow  production,  investment,  and  export \nactivities. At the same time, they also redistribute income back to households from \ncorporations  and  therefore  contribute  to  faster  growth  of  consumption.  However, \nchange of the growth model is only in its nascence and further reforms are necessary \nto push the PRC\u2019s growth model onto a more sustainable path. \nFigure 4: Monthly Wages of Migrant Workers in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(yuan, 1978 price) \n400\n350\nReal salary Polynominal trend\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n1980 1988 1996 2004 2012\n \nSource: Lu Feng. 2011.

Likonomics is popularly regarded as supported by three \npillars: no major stimulus, deleveraging, and structural reforms (Huang 2013). Since \nlate 2012, the government has shown an unusual tolerance for slowing growth, as GDP \ngrowth stayed constantly below 8%. Although the policy makers are still mindful about \ndownside  risks,  they  take  a  relatively  more  relaxed  approach  toward  the  growth \nslowdown as long as it stays close to the new and lower growth potential, evidenced by \nthe robust labor market. \nThe  success  or  failure  of  Likonomics  will  be  determined  by  the  outcome  of  the \nstructural  reforms.  Policy  makers  and  policy  advisors  are  currently  working  on \nproposals for an extended reform agenda, including the financial sector, fiscal policy, \nland  use,  factor  price,  income  distribution,  administrative  controls,  and  household \nregistration system. These are all very important, but the following three will dictate the \nsustainability of the PRC\u2019s growth: (i) change of local government behavior from direct \ninvolvement in economic activities to public goods provision; (ii) restructuring of the \nstate-owned enterprises to reduce monopoly power and implicit government support; \nand (iii) liberalization of factor markets, especially that of capital. These reforms should \nsupport the continuous rise of the country\u2019s economy in the global system and further \nincrease the importance of the currency. \nIn the meantime, it is equally important for the PRC to participate or even lead global \nliberalization efforts, including the Group of Twenty process and other international \ninitiatives. It is hard to imagine the RMB as a global currency if the PRC is absent from \nor even resists such global initiatives. \n4.2  Openness and Depth of Financial Markets \nAn international currency should be supported by well-developed financial markets that \nare  freely  accessible  by  nonresidents,  sufficiently  liquid,  reasonably  stable,  and \nequipped with effective hedging instruments. To achieve these goals, the PRC needs \nto liberalize its capital account to allow free flow of capital across the border. That \nalone,  however,  is  not  enough.  The  lack  of  capital  account  restrictions  does  not \nnecessarily mean that the capital market is open. Here, again, Japan provides another \nimportant reference. While Japan\u2019s capital markets are large, they are not very liquid \nand foreign investment remains limited. \nThe PRC appears to have accelerated its efforts of capital account liberalization after \nthe new government took office in March 2013. One expectation is that the PBC plans \nto achieve basic convertibility of the RMB under the capital account by 2015 and full \nconvertibility by 2020. Such an expectation is certainly consistent with the monetary \nauthority\u2019s  plans  of  introducing  market-based  interest  rates,  adopting  the  deposit \ninsurance  system,  strengthening  market  disciplines  for  financial  institutions,  and \nallowing residents to access overseas capital markets. \nIt is important to point out that capital account liberalization did not just start. It has \nbeen going on for more than 30 years in the PRC. We can use some quantitative \nmeasures of capital account control to illustrate this point (Figure 5). The literature \nprovides two types of measures for the PRC\u2019s capital account controls: one de jure \nindicator, such as the Chinn\u2013Ito index (Chinn and Ito 2008) and Quinn\u2019s longitudinal \ndata (Quinn and Toyoda 2008); and the other de facto indicator such as the TOTAL \nIndex by Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007). The former often has too broad a category \ncoverage and fails to capture important changes over time, while the latter cannot \ndistinguish impacts of capital account liberalization from those of other macroeconomic \nchanges. The measure depicted in Figure 5 is a de jure index constructed by Huang et \n20 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 482              Huang, Wang, and Fan \nal.  (2012)  by  going  through  thousands  of  policy  documents  issued  by  the  State \nAdministration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) during the past three decades. \nHuang et al. (2012) assumed complete control of the capital account for 1977, the year \nbefore the leaders officially launched the economic reform. They then adopted the \nclassifications used by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \nand SAFE, i.e., 11 categories of capital account transactions. For each item, a score of \n3 denotes full control, 2 strong control, 1 slight control, and 0 liberalized. By updating \nthe index in response to legislation issued, an index ranging from January 1978 to \nDecember 2010 is constructed to describe the extensiveness of the PRC\u2019s capital \ncontrol. The results clearly show that capital account liberalization has been going on \nfor some time in the PRC. In fact, the authorities adopted a well-established strategy \nfor liberalization\u2014inflows first, outflows later; long-term first, short-term later; and direct \ninvestment first, portfolio investment later. If the index was 100 at the start of the \neconomic reform, it has already come down to close to 50 in recent years. \nFigure 5: Capital Account Restriction Index \n100\n95\n90\n85\n80\n75\n70\n65\n60\n55\n50\nSep-77 Sep-81 Sep-85 Sep-89 Sep-93 Sep-97 Sep-01 Sep-05 Sep-09\n \nSource: Huang et al. (2012). \nYet, several areas are still under strict regulation (Table 7). In opening the securities \nmarkets to foreign investors, the government pursued a strategy of segmenting the \nmarkets with different investors. Foreign investors can participate in the transaction of \nforeign currency\u2013denominated shares and debt instruments, such as the B shares, H \nshares, and red chips stocks. However, the RMB-denominated A shares, bonds, or \nother money market instruments are not open to the nonresident investors unless they \nhave  a  QFII  quota.  Restrictions  on  PRC  residents  are  even  stricter.  Generally, \nresidents  cannot  buy,  sell,  or  issue  capital  or  money  market  instruments  in  the \noverseas markets outside the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) scheme.  \nThere  is  currently  a  huge  debate  in  the  PRC  about  planned  capital  account \nliberalization,  especially  about  its  sequencing  and  timing.  While  most  economists \nconcur that achieving free capital account is beneficial for the economy by bringing \nabout efficiency improvement, the critical question is about associated financial risk. \nAre the financial institutions and markets sound enough to withstand volatile capital \nflows? As suggested by McKinnon (1991), domestic reforms should be pushed forward \nalong with the opening of the capital account. These reforms consist of reduction of \nstate intervention in the operation of major financial institutions, introduction of market-\nbased interest rates, greater flexibility of the exchange rate, and improvement in the \n21 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 482              Huang, Wang, and Fan \nindependence of the central bank\u2019s monetary policy making (Dobson and Masson \n2009). \nTable 7: Capital Account Management in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n  Non  Partially  Mostly  Fully \nTotal \nConvertible  Convertible  Convertible  Convertible \nCapital and money market instrument  2  10  4    16 \nDerivatives and other instruments  2  2      4 \nCredit operation    1  5    6 \nDirect investment    1  1    2 \nLiquidation of direct investment      1    1 \nReal estate transaction    2  1    3 \nPersonal capital transaction    6  2    8 \nTotal  4  22  14    40 \nSources: People\u2019s Bank of China; International Monetary Fund Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements \nand Exchange Restrictions Report. \n4.3  Credibility of Economic and Legal Systems \nAn international currency is one that nonresidents would use not only in normal times \nbut also depend on at crisis times. Therefore, just having a strong economy and an \nopen market is not sufficient. The US dollar served as a global currency during much of \nthe 20th century because of the well-established legal system in the US and the \nFederal Reserve System, as well as its efficient market and strong economy. This is \nperhaps the highest hurdle that the PRC will need to overcome in order to make the \nRMB an international currency. If the PRC succeeds, it would be historical because it \nwould be the first time in centuries that a developing country\u2019s currency becomes a \nglobal  currency\u2014and  developing  economies  by  definition  are  unstable,  volatile \n(although often with stronger growth), and vulnerable in the face of shocks. \nWe are unable to provide a complete list of the tasks for improving the credibility of the \nPRC\u2019s economic and legal system, but we can start with at least the following three. \nOne, the PRC needs an independent central bank. While there are many reasons the \nPBC is not independent\u2014and perhaps there are many good reasons why that is the \ncase\u2014this could seriously affect the achievement of monetary policy objectives in an \nopen  economy.  Of  course,  independent  monetary  policy  making  does  not  mean \ncomplete lack of coordination with the government. It should possess the following \ncharacteristics. First, monetary policies should have clearly defined policy objectives, \nsuch  as  growth  or  inflation.  Supporting  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  or  local \ngovernments, however, should not be a part of the PBC\u2019s obligation. Second, the PBC \nshould use monetary policy instruments such as interest rates and liquidity measures, \nabandoning administrative tools such as credit quota and window guidance. And finally, \nthe PBC should also improve quality and timeliness of its monetary policies. \nTwo, the PRC needs a fair and transparent legal system to protect property rights and \nto enforce bankruptcy. An economy with many loss-making SOEs and monopoly state-\nowned financial institutions could never support an international currency. Nonresidents \nwill have confidence in holding RMB assets only if they know that their property rights \nare effectively protected and they will be fairly treated even if they are involved in \neconomic disputes with PRC SOEs. \nAnd three, political reforms may also be needed to improve the transparency and \nrepresentativeness of the political system. While we do not have a fixed idea about \nspecific forms of needed political reform, to become a global economic leader, the PRC \n22 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 482              Huang, Wang, and Fan \nneeds  to  adopt  a  political  system  that  the  rest  of  the  world  trusts.  Here,  again, \nimportant changes are necessary to systemically crack down on corruption, reduce \nsocial tension, and build a harmonious society. \n5.  WHAT ARE THE LIKELY IMPLICATIONS? \nInternationalization of the RMB will likely be an ongoing process and making it an \ninternational reserve currency should also be a long-term goal. Before that, however, \nthe  RMB\u2019s  international  role  may  grow  gradually  over  time.  Some  PRC  scholars \nspeculated  that  it  would  take  three  decades  for  it  to  be  internationalized:  in  the \nneighboring areas during the first decade, within the region during the second decade, \nand globally during the final decade (Chen 2013). While we are not sure about the \nexact timing of each of these stages, the trajectory sounds reasonable, i.e., the RMB\u2019s \nrole will be extended gradually from the neighboring areas to the global system. \nThe growing international role of the RMB, even if it is a gradual process, should \ngenerate significant implications for the PRC, regional economies, and the rest of the \nworld. First, increasing its use in international trade and investment settlement could \nremove one important economic risk\u2014exchange rate uncertainty\u2014for PRC households \nand corporations. Exchange rate uncertainty is one of the main difficulties faced by \nexporters, especially those of low-margin exports, and importers. Use of the RMB as a \nsettlement currency means that the exporters no longer need to worry about potential \nlosses caused by currency appreciation (or by currency depreciation for importers). \nHowever, this is true only if exports or imports are priced in RMB. Currently, a large \nportion of trade and investment settled in RMB are still priced in US dollars, which will \nnot remove the exchange rate risk for PRC exporters and importers. Therefore, a \ncritical step is to grant the RMB not only the function of means of exchange but also \nunit of account. \nSecond, turning the RMB into an international reserve currency may help reduce the \nPRC\u2019s balance of payment risks, in addition to the seigniorage revenue. On the one \nhand, as the PRC is able to hold both international assets and liabilities in RMB, it \nlowers the risk of a currency crisis, potentially forced upon the PRC by a sudden stop \nor sudden reversal of cross-border capital flows. On the other hand, even if the country \nsuffers from an international payment deficit, the PBC would have the option of printing \nmore  currency  to  meet  the  shortfall.  International  investor  confidence  in  a  global \nreserve  currency  should  also  be  less  volatile  than  that  in  any  other  developing \neconomy currencies\u2014and this should support overall financial stability. \nThird,  the  RMB  as  a  global  reserve  currency  should  facilitate  regional  economic \ncooperation and integration. East Asia used to be a de facto US dollar block. In the \n1980s, the yen became an important anchor for some regional currencies such as the \nwon and the NT dollar. This led Mundell to identify Asia dominated by the yen as one of \nthe three islands of stability\u2014the other two were North America dominated by the US \ndollar and Europe dominated by the euro (Mundell 1999). However, the yen quickly \npeaked following stagnation of the Japanese economy. In the aftermath of the Asian \nfinancial crisis, there was an important proposal for creating an Asian currency (Kawai \n2008). This proposal, however, lost momentum as its role model, the eurozone, fell into \na debt crisis. However, if the RMB becomes an international currency, there is a \npossibility for it to serve as an anchor of regional currencies in Asia. In fact, our earlier \nanalyses reveal that it already plays some kind of a role as a regional currency anchor \nalongside the US dollar. \n23 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 482              Huang, Wang, and Fan \nLast, the most important implication of RMB internationalization may be the associated \nreforms the PRC is about to implement. As discussed earlier, such reforms range from \nmeasures to make economic growth more sustainable to those leading to improvement \nof efficiency and stability of financial markets as well as to economic and political \nstability. In this sense, we may view RMB internationalization as having similar effects \non overall economic reform as accession to the World Trade Organization at the end of \n2001,  which  almost  completely  revamped  the  PRC\u2019s  economic  system.  If  the \ngovernment seriously implements those reforms, the economy would certainly become \nmore efficient, more dynamic, and more powerful, regardless of whether the RMB \nbecomes an international reserve currency in the end. A stronger economy and a more \ntransparent regime can significantly strengthen the PRC\u2019s soft power in the world \n(Helleiner  2003).  Even  for  this  purpose,  RMB  internationalization  is  a  worthwhile \nagenda to pursue. \nHowever, internationalization of the RMB, like any other economic strategy, could have \nits own downside risks. One potential risk is premature liberalization of the capital \naccount. Experiences of developing countries with financial liberalization in the 1980s \nand thereafter were accompanied by frequent financial crises. At the moment, the PRC \nalready suffers from a series of important risks, including a high M2/GDP ratio at 200%, \nlarge local government borrowing, and serious property bubbles. The government\u2019s \ntentative  reform  program  could  mean  speedy  liberalization  of  interest  rates,  of \nexchange rates, and of the capital account. It is not yet clear how big the shocks will be \nfor financial institutions and manufacturing industries. If the sudden rise of cost of \ncapital and rapid outflow of capital cause serious dislocations in the economy, growth \nrecession and financial crisis could easily materialize. Even if the RMB becomes an \ninternational  reserve  currency,  it  will  have  to  maintain  a  relatively  open  financial \nsystem.  Whether  or  not  the  PRC\u2019s  economy  and  markets  are  strong  enough  to \nwithstand  serious  economic  and  financial  shocks,  including  speculative  attacks, \nremains to be seen. \nAnother major challenge is that if the RMB becomes an international reserve currency \nin the coming decades, the PRC should remain a developing country. It would be the \nfirst time in history that a developing country currency serves as a global reserve \ncurrency.  Developing  country  currencies  are,  by  definition,  less  stable.  This  could \npotentially  increase  the  instability  of  the  international  monetary  system.  More \nimportantly, if internationalization of the RMB is successful, the currency would likely \nserve as one of the global reserve currencies, alongside at least the US dollar and the \neuro. According to some experts, an international monetary system with more than one \nglobal  reserve  currency  is  actually  more  unstable  than  one  with  a  single  reserve \ncurrency (UN 2009). If that is indeed true, the international community should seriously \nconsider proposals for creating a supranational currency (Zhou 2009; UN 2009). \n6.  SUMMARY OF THE MAIN FINDINGS \nThe PBC started planning the internationalization of the RMB from at least 2006. \nHowever, actual implementation picked up pace amid the global financial crisis, which \nhinted at the potential weakening of the role of the US dollar and demand for an \nalternative  international  currency.  This  process  likely  will  accelerate  further  in  the \ncoming years, as the new government focuses more on structural reforms. The PBC \nadopted a two-track strategy for internationalizing the currency, with the first track \ndirectly promoting the international use of the currency and the second track gradually \nliberalizing the capital account. \n24 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 482              Huang, Wang, and Fan \nSo far, the emphasis has been on increasing the international use of the currency. This \nincludes use of the RMB for trade and investment settlement, mainly with neighboring \nand  regional  economies;  establishment  of offshore markets  in  Hong  Kong,  China, \nevidenced by the rapid growth of RMB deposits held by local residents; issuance of \nRMB-denominated bonds and other securities in Hong Kong, China and London; a \nlarge number of currency swap agreements; and holdings of RMB by some foreign \ncentral banks as part of their foreign currency reserves. A significant increase in the \ninternational  use  of  the  RMB  so  far  is  supported  by  three  related  factors: \nencouragement of the government, strong growth of economic activities (the PRC is \nalready the largest trading partner of many regional economies), and expectations of \nRMB appreciation. \nHowever,  the  RMB  is  still far from  being  an  international  reserve  currency.  Many \noptimists tend to pay a lot of attention to the PRC\u2019s already gigantic economy. The \nlogic is simple: the PRC is already a major economy in the world, and its currency \nshould  therefore  play  some  international  role.  A  quick  review  of  experiences  of \ninternational currencies during the 20th century suggests that size of the economy may \nbe an important favorable factor, but it is by no means a sufficient condition. We apply \nquantitative  methods  to  identify  determinants  of  international  currencies\u2019  shares  in \nglobal reserves and then use the results to predict the RMB\u2019s potential share. We find \nthat if only GDP and trade weights are used, its potential share could be as high as \n10% of the global reserves at the end of 2011. However, if policy and institutional \nfactors, such as capital account controls and economic freedom, are considered, the \nRMB\u2019s potential share would only reach around 2%. These results suggest that the \nmain obstacles for the RMB to become an international reserve currency are policy \nrestrictions and institutional barriers. \nSo what should the PRC do to effectively internationalize its currency? It can certainly \ncontinue to push on the first track, i.e., promoting its use in international economic \ntransactions,  including  establishment  of  more  offshore  markets,  issuance  of  more \nRMB-denominated assets overseas, and use for trade and investment settlement. The \nPRC may also adopt two additional strategies for this purpose. One is to add the RMB \nto the IMF\u2019s SDR basket, which should significantly raise the international profile of the \ncurrency and make internationalization efforts a lot easier. And the other is to introduce \na new mechanism for intraregional cross-holding of reserve currencies in Asia. \nHowever, for the purpose of currency internationalization, the broadly defined second \ntrack of the two-track strategy is probably more critical as it creates the foundation of a \nglobal  reserve  currency.  We  identify  reforms  in  the  following  three  areas  for  this \npurpose. \nThe  first  area  is  to  support  the  sustainable  growth  of  the  PRC  economy.  While \neconomic weights are not sufficient conditions for a global reserve currency, any hopes \nfor  the  RMB  to  become  an  international  currency  could  collapse  if  the  economy \nsuddenly stagnates, similar to what happened to the Japanese economy in the 1990s. \nAn imminent challenge for the PRC economy now is to change the growth model, \nwhich  may  be  characterized  as  a  combination  of  strong  growth  and  serious \nimbalances. The key is to further economic reforms. The new government\u2019s economic \npolicy framework, popularly termed \u201cLikonomics,\u201d contains three important pillars\u2014no \nmore major stimulus, deleveraging to control financial risks, and structural reforms. \nGovernment officials and policy advisors are working on reform programs for a large \nnumber of areas, including the financial system, fiscal policy, land use, administrative \ncontrols,  factor  prices,  income  inequality,  and  household  registration  system. \nSuccessful  transformation  of  the  growth  model  depends  critically  on  the  following \nreforms\u2014liberalization  of  interest  rates,  exchange  rates,  and  the  capital  account; \n25 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 482              Huang, Wang, and Fan \nchange  of  the  local  governments\u2019  role  from  directly  engaging  in  production  and \ninvestment to public goods provision; and breakdown of the monopoly power of the \nstate sector. \nThe second area is to create an open, large, efficient, and liquid financial market. To \nserve as an international reserve currency, the RMB needs to be supported by a \nfinancial  market  that  is  easily  accessible  by  nonresidents.  One  major  step  is  to \nliberalize the capital account. This has been an ongoing process, with the capital \naccount control index declining from 100% in 1977 to 53% in 2011. The government \nnow plans to realize basic convertibility by 2015 and full convertibility by 2020. There is, \nhowever, a major debate as to whether this might be too aggressive and could trigger a \nfinancial crisis. The answer to this should be to keep a close eye on both the necessary \nconditions and sequencing of liberalization. Nevertheless, capital account liberalization \nis also a necessary step for currency internationalization. However, financial markets \nneed  to  be  open,  liquid,  and  efficient,  and  equipped  with  well-developed  hedging \ninstruments. \nThe third area is to improve the credibility of the PRC\u2019s economic and political systems. \nThe essence of an international reserve currency is that international investors have \nlong-term confidence in it. To support such confidence, the PRC needs to improve its \neconomic, legal, and political systems. This is particularly important since all other \nexisting international reserve currencies are from developed economies that have well-\ndeveloped economic and political systems. We suggest three starting steps for the \nPRC: (i) an independent monetary policy-making mechanism, (ii) a sound legal system \nthat protects property rights and enforces bankruptcy law, and (iii) a political system \nthat is more transparent and better represented. \nEven if all these efforts are successful, we think the internationalization of the RMB will \nbe  a  long-term  process. We  do not think  the RMB  will  become  a global  reserve \ncurrency in the coming decade or any time soon after that. The RMB\u2019s international \nrole, however, may be extended steadily, perhaps first in the neighboring areas, then in \nthe region, and finally globally.  \nThis process could also generate significant implications for the PRC, the region, and \nthe rest of the world. If the RMB is used as a unit of account, it would remove exchange \nrate uncertainties for PRC households and corporations in international transactions. If \nthe PRC can hold its international assets and liabilities all in RMB, it should also reduce \nthe country\u2019s balance of payment risks, in addition to the seigniorage revenue. The \nmost fundamental impact of RMB internationalization could be to push comprehensive \nreforms in the PRC economy, similar to the effect of WTO accession on the economy \nmore than 10 years ago. For some PRC officials and scholars, this factor alone would \nmake currency internationalization a worthwhile agenda to pursue. \nAt the same time, an aggressive push of the reform agenda could also increase the \npotential  risk  of  financial  instability.  Even  if  the  RMB  successfully  becomes  an \ninternational  reserve  currency,  the  PRC  would  have  to  withstand  more  frequent \nfinancial shocks or even speculative attacks. It also remains to be seen if adding a \ndeveloping  country  currency  to  the  global  reserve  currency  basket  increases  or \ndecreases the instability of the international monetary system.    \n26 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 482              Huang, Wang, and Fan \nAPPENDIX \nWe perform four types of robustness checks in this analysis. First, as argued in the \ncontext,  market  capitalization  is  probably  not  an  accurate  representative  of  actual \ndegree of financial market development. The second column of Table A1 redefines \nfinancial development as a share of private and public bond market capitalization to \ngross  domestic  product  (Beck,  Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt,  and  Levine  2000).  The  alternative \nspecification suggests a positive impact from financial development on currency share \nin global reserves, which is consistent with previous evidence.  \nSecond,  instead  of  classifying  institutional  development  as  economic  freedom,  we \nchoose the variables economic regulation and socioeconomic stability as indicating the \ndevelopment of institutions. The third and fourth columns confirm the results and, not \nsurprisingly, show that there is no significant difference compared with the benchmark \nmodel in Column 1 of Table A1.  \nFinally, we include log transformation to allow nonlinearity in determining currency \nshare in global reserves, as suggested in Chen, Peng, and Shu (2009). Clearly, as \nsuggested in the fifth column of Table A1, there is not much discrepancy in terms of the \nsignificance and signs of the estimated coefficients. \nTable A1: Robustness Check of Determination of Currency Shares \nDependent Variable: currency share in global reserves \nExplanatory Variables \nBenchmark  Bond Market  Regulation  Socio-Eco.
