The report is more \ncomprehensive than those issued in 2007 \nand 2009. It highlights how we at the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) work with our \nclient countries to facilitate their growth and \ndevelopment in a manner that is economically, \nenvironmentally, and socially sustainable. The \nreport also covers how we are continuing to \nrefine operations to minimize our environmental \nfootprint.\n\nGovernments in Asia and the Pacific have \nincreasingly recognized that, for economic \ngrowth to be sustainable, they must find ways to \nhalt environment degradation. ADB\u2019s long-term \nstrategic framework\u2014Strategy 2020\u2014reaffirms \nour mission of eliminating poverty in Asia and the \nPacific and directs our energies into three areas \nthat are critical for achieving that goal: inclusive \neconomic growth, environmentally sustainable \ngrowth, and regional integration. \n\nIn response to the need for green growth, and in \nline with Strategy 2020 where environment is one \nof the five core areas of our operations, we are \ncontinuing to support investments in sustainable \ninfrastructure and natural resource management \nand to promote capacity development for \nenvironmental management. To this end we also \nactively help tackle the causes and consequences \nof climate change by promoting low carbon \n\ngrowth and climate adaptation and in 2010 we \nissued our strategic priorities for action to address \nclimate change in Asia and the Pacific. While \npursuing this agenda we work with a wide range \nof partners and foster regional cooperation. \n\nADB is responding in numerous ways to promote \ngreen growth and address climate change. \nFor example, our investments in clean energy \nhave surpassed our target of $1 billion per \nyear, moving to $1.7 billion; our Sustainable \nTransport Initiative promotes investments in low \ncarbon, safe, accessible, and affordable transport \nsystems to ensure inclusive and environmentally \nsustainable growth; and the Asia Solar Energy \nInitiative will lower barriers to and raises \nfinancing for solar power projects.\n\nMomentum is growing with respect to the \nimplementation of several of our ongoing \ninitiatives. Through the Cities Development \nInitiative for Asia, we help to promote \u201clivable\u201d \nurban environments. Our Water Financing \nProgram works to increase investments and \nsupport reforms in rural, urban, and river \nbasin water, toward achieving \u201cWater for All.\u201d \nSeveral of our programs focus on supporting \nbetter management of natural resources and \necosystems\u2014including the Coral Triangle \nInitiative, the Greater Mekong Subregion \nBiodiversity Conservation Corridors Initiative, \nand the Heart of Borneo Initiative. Under our \n\nviii      \n\n\fSince well before our first sustainability report, we \nhave been working to promote environmentally \nsustainable growth, strengthen governance, and \nbroaden inclusive social development. I am very \npleased to report that our efforts have now been \nheightened. Our third Sustainability Report comes \nat an important juncture in our history. Our \nshareholders voted to triple our capital base, and \nwe have expanded our operations to meet part of \nthe vast needs in Asia and the Pacific to combat \npoverty and provide a decent standard of living \nfor the many diverse peoples who live here. To do \nthis we are committed to use our own resources \nsustainably and assist our client countries to do \nthe same. \n\nOperational Plan for Food Security, we assist \nthe agricultural and natural resource sector to \nenhance productivity, improve market access, \nand deepen needed reforms. We help our client \ncountries identify disaster and hazard risks and \nbuild their capacity to manage and respond to \nthem.\n\nWe are also making good progress with our \nclimate change adaptation program to help \nour client countries build climate resilience by \nincorporating climate vulnerability and risks \nin national development strategies and action \nplans, assessing climate adaptation opportunities \nin vulnerable sectors and regions, dealing with \nthe social dimensions of climate change, and \nclimate proofing projects.\n\nAll our projects are subject to environmental and \nsocial safeguards, and in July 2009, our Board of \nDirectors approved the new Safeguard Policy \nStatement, which builds on the three previous \nsafeguard policies on environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples and \nprovides a consolidated framework that enhances \ntheir effectiveness and relevance. The Safeguard \nPolicy Statement aims to avoid, minimize, or \nmitigate harmful environmental impacts and \nsocial costs, and to help clients strengthen their \nown safeguard systems. The policy also provides \na platform for participation by affected people \nand other stakeholders in project design and \nimplementation.\n\nWhile assisting our client countries toward \ngreen growth, we apply the same principles \u201cat \nhome\u201d by reducing the impact our headquarters\u2019 \nactivities have on the environment. For example, \nwe are now harvesting and using rainwater, \nwe have been recertified under ISO 14001 and \nOHSAS 18001, and we are working to have LEED \ncertification for our headquarters.\n\n  \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda\nPresident\nAsian Development Bank\n\nThe President\u2019s Message     ix\n\n\fForeword\n\nIn the 2 years since we at the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) issued our second sustainability \nreport, our region of operations\u2014Asia and the \nPacific\u2014has made important strides toward \npoverty reduction. The progress has been made \ndespite the global financial crisis that started in \n2007 and severe natural disasters. ADB continues \nto work to decrease poverty and foster inclusive \nand environmentally sustainable growth.\n\nIndeed, The Agreement Establishing the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB\u2019s Charter) states that \nADB\u2019s purpose is \u201cto foster economic growth \nand cooperation in the region of Asia and the \nFar East\u2026and to contribute to the acceleration \nof the process of economic development \nof the developing member countries in the \nregion, collectively and individually.\u201d In line \nwith the Charter, in 1999 ADB adopted its \nPoverty Reduction Strategy, making poverty \nreduction the central goal of our work. This was \nreinforced and further articulated in 2008 with \nthe approval of Strategy 2020, which identified \nthree complementary strategic agendas: inclusive \ngrowth, environmentally sustainable growth, and \nregional integration.\n  \nTo facilitate environmentally sustainable growth, \nwe promote investments in sound environmental \nand natural resource management, low carbon \ngrowth, and adaptation to climate change. \nAnd we support our client countries\u2019 efforts \n\ntoward green growth through loans, grants, and \ntechnical assistance while promoting policy, \ncapacity, and knowledge development. To \nfacilitate inclusive growth, we work to assure \nthat people are adequately fed, that children are \neducated regardless of gender, that women\u2019s \nimportant role in development is recognized \nand effective because their opinions are \ntaken into consideration and they are actively \ninvolved in the decision process, and that all \nstakeholders are engaged regardless of ethnicity \nand socioeconomic status. Good governance is \nessential to effective, equitable growth and for \nhuman, financial, and natural resources to be \nsustainably managed.\n\nThe need for development financing is vastly \ngreater than we can provide. We have to use \nour own limited resources judiciously, focusing \non results and development effectiveness. To \nleverage our effectiveness and help us \u201cwalk the \ntalk,\u201d we work in partnership with a wide range of \nstakeholders in this effort\u2014governments of our \nborrowing members and of our donor members; \nsubnational levels of government; other \ndevelopment agencies, both bi- and multi-lateral; \nnongovernment organizations, both national and \ninternational; civil society; and the private sector. \n\nWe also work hard to assure that our corporate \nbehavior is in line with the best standards for \ncorporate responsibility. We are endeavoring \n\nx      \n\n\fto follow the G3 guidelines of the Global \nReporting Initiative, which has pioneered the \nworld\u2019s most widely used sustainability reporting \nframework. Our Environmental Health and Safety \nManagement System, which has been recertified \nunder ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001, continues \nto make our operations more resource-efficient \nas our staff numbers and building occupancy \nincrease. Further, our recent initiative to secure \ncertification for Leadership in Energy and \nEnvironmental Design (LEED) through the US \nGreen Building Council is additional proof of our \nefforts toward sustainability.\n\nPreparation of this report was overseen by us. An \ninterdepartmental team, led by Nessim J. Ahmad, \nDirector of the Environment and Safeguards \nDivision, managed the report\u2019s compilation and \npresentation, with key support from Daniele \nPonzi, Lead Environment Specialist in the \nEnvironment and Safeguards Division. Team \nmembers included Chatiya Nantham, Head of the \nFacilities Planning and Management Unit; Helen \n\nCruda, Environment Specialist; Natasha Davis, \nHead of the Planning and Coordination Unit \nof the Office of Administrative Services; Marie \nAntoinette Virtucio, Environment Officer; Julito \nBaldisimo, Facilities Planning and Management \nOfficer (EHSM); and Ma. Charina Munda, Senior \nOperations Assistant. Sophia Cho, Human \nResources Specialist, and Susan Kerr, Principal \nHuman Resources Specialist, were particularly \nhelpful with the many inputs needed from \nhuman resources. Jill Gale de Villa was project \ncoordinator and editor. Any such undertaking is \nan organization-wide affair and a full list of the \nmany people who contributed to and assisted \nwith the work is given at the end of the report.\n\nWe intend this Sustainability Report to enhance \nunderstanding of how ADB is organized and \nis working to meet the many challenges to \nsustainable growth both in our region of \noperations and within our organization. We \nwelcome feedback on the report to  \nnjahmad@adb.org.\n\nXianbin Yao\nDirector General\nRegional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment\n\nBenjamin Lee\nPrincipal Director\nOffice of Administrative Services\n\nForeword      xi\n\n\fAbout the Report\n\nSustainability reporting is an important element \nin the corporate world\u2019s growing commitment \nto be accountable and responsible for actions \ntaken as global and local citizens. Multilateral \ndevelopment institutions, which aim to foster \nsound economic development, are also reporting \non their environmental, social development, and \ngovernance efforts as well as their corporate \nstructures. We at the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) issued our first sustainability report in 2007, \nand our second, covering 2007\u20132008, two years \nlater. This third report covers 2009\u20132010. We \nintend to issue a sustainability report every  \ntwo years.\n\nStructure. Like the first two ADB sustainability \nreports, this document responds to the third \nguidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative \n(GRI) G3, launched in 2006, which we adapt to \nour unique work and the interests of the many \nstakeholders seeking the information presented. \nLike other multilateral development institutions, \nADB has found it needs to tailor its sustainability \nreporting to its development work. \n\nWhile we have attempted to avoid unduly \nrepeating information provided in the first two \nreports, some facts about ADB\u2019s organization \nand program are presented again so that this \ndocument may present a clear picture of our \noperations. \n\nWe are pleased that coverage in this report is \nmore complete and accurate than in previous \nreports because additional data are available, \npartly to more fully meet the G3 indicators.\n\nFocus. The report highlights how our efforts, \nbased around Strategy 2020: The Long-Term \nStrategy of the Asian Development Bank, aim to \nimprove the lives of the poor in Asia and the \nPacific and to ensure that future generations will \nnot be disadvantaged by the activities of today. \n\nAudience. The report targets a wide audience, \nincluding our member governments, ADB staff, \nthe international development community, \nacademia, international and national civil society \norganizations (including nongovernment \norganizations), socially responsible investment \norganizations and fund managers, public and \nprivate sector proponents of projects in which \nADB is involved, and project beneficiaries \nin Asia and the Pacific. Our stakeholders are \norganizations and people who can be involved \nin or affected by our operations. Thus, the set of \nstakeholders varies with each activity.\n\nWe have tried to satisfy the needs of the multiple \naudiences this report is intended to serve, \nand we encourage your feedback to help us \nmake subsequent reports even better. E-mail \ncomments to njahmad@adb.org.\n\nxii      \n\n\fReport scope and boundary. This report covers \nthe region\u2019s significant environmental, social, \nand economic challenges, and ADB\u2019s responses, \nboth through our operations (Part 2) and our \ncorporate footprint (Part 3). When preparing \nthis Sustainability Report, ADB has applied the \nGRI G3 principles for defining the report content \nto identify material topics of interest to our \nstakeholders. For this report, we reviewed our \nreporting approach to better focus on material \ntopics, and prioritize and align the reporting to \nour Strategy 2020 and stakeholder interests. The \nreport has been formulated with input and advice \nfrom many ADB staff in our diverse departments \nand divisions.\n\nContent. The report provides ready reference to \nADB\u2019s relevant policies, practices, and programs \nas well as to additional related information. To \nfacilitate comparability, the structure of our \ncurrent Sustainability Report is similar to that of \nour first two reports and roughly in keeping with \nthe G3 guidelines.\n\nPart 1 provides information about and data \non our corporate structure, operations, and \ngovernance.\n\nPart 2 focuses especially on our work to improve \nenvironmental management (including \naddressing climate change), social development, \nand governance in Asia and the Pacific, all of \nwhich are intimately tied to the environmental \nand social sustainability of our development \nwork. \n\n(cid:114)(cid:1)\n\n(cid:114)(cid:1)\n\nPart 3 presents information about our corporate \noperations and staff, and how we are working \nto lessen our corporate footprint on our office\u2019s \nenvirons, the region, and the globe. This section \nfocuses primarily on our headquarters in \nManila, Philippines.\n\nThe Appendix, Measuring Up with the Global \nReporting Initiative Indicators, cross-references \nthe contents of the report with elements of G3.\n\nData measurement and assurance. Data \nmeasurements and techniques used adhere to \nGRI protocols where possible, and given data \navailability. Any restatements of data presented \nin previous years are fully noted and explained. \nWe have a range of internal processes to review \nand check the accuracy of data in this report. ADB \nuses independent auditors to audit its financial \nstatements (see our annual reports). ADB has \nprepared a \u201cB application level\u201d sustainability \nreport in accordance with GRI G3 guidelines \n(www.globalreporting.org/ReportingFramework/\nG3Guidelines/).\n\nTerminology and usage.

ADB continues to \nwork toward the vision of an Asia and Pacific \nregion that is free of poverty. During the last \n2 decades, some countries of our region have \nmade remarkable progress in poverty reduction, \nbut much remains to be done (Figure 1.1). While \ngender equality in primary and secondary \neducation has improved substantially, general \neducation achievements lag, many people of \nour region still subsist on less than $1.25 a day, \nchild mortality is much too high, environmental \ndegradation is continuing, and other indicators \nshow the urgent need for improvement. Our work \nis far from complete.\n\nTo help foster the broad-based economic growth \nthat has contributed to poverty reduction, ADB \n\nprovides a range of services to its client countries. \nWe invest in development projects, such as those \nproviding new infrastructure; build partnerships \nwith other development agencies, the private \nsector, and the public; carry out policy dialogue \nto support appropriate reforms; strengthen key \ninstitutions; develop and disseminate information \non policies and investment approaches that are \neffective for reducing poverty and promoting \nsustainable development; and encourage self-\nhelp initiatives across a wide range of sectors. \nWhile our primary customers are the national \ngovernments of our client countries (\u201cdeveloping \nmember countries\u201d), our work with the private \nsector and with local communities is  \nexpanding rapidly.\n\nADB assumes several types of risks in its work, \nsuch as credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, and \noperational risk. We adhere to the precautionary \nprinciple in handling these risks. Prior to approval \nby our Board of Directors, the risks of each project \nare carefully evaluated through due diligence \n\n2      \n\n\fprocedures,1 and our safeguards (see pp. 50\u201352)\nplay a crucial role in preventing and mitigating \nthe environmental and social risks of projects.\n\nmanagement team prepares integrated risk \nreports covering ADB\u2019s overall risk profile, for the \nBoard of Directors and Audit Committee.\n\nADB\u2019s risk management governance also includes \nthe Risk Committee, which provides high-\nlevel oversight of ADB\u2019s risks and recommends \nrisk policies and actions to the President and \nthe Audit Committee of the Board. ADB\u2019s \n\nFor nonsovereign transactions, our Office of Risk \nManagement (ORM) develops and implements \npolicies and procedures to measure, monitor, \nand control these risks.2  The ORM assesses \nrisks of new nonsovereign lending, equity \n\nFigure 1.1  Percent of ADB developing members considered  \noff-track in meeting the Millennium Development Goals \n\n1.

Our staff has worked on developing \nclean energy sources and sustainable transport \ninfrastructure for the region, enhancing \nthe sustainability of agriculture, expanding \neducational opportunities, establishing effective \nfinancial institutions, building water supply and \nsanitation systems, and much more.\n\nLike other multilateral development banks, we \nsupport our client countries financially primarily \nin three ways:\n\u2022  providing grants and loans to help countries \nmeet their major economic, social, and \nenvironmental goals for sustainable \ndevelopment;\ngiving grants for technical assistance to \nstrengthen policies, build institutional \ncapacity, and support specific development \nprojects; and\nhelping to mobilize public and private capital \nfor development projects.3\n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n \nIn all of this, we are guided by our own policies, \nstrategies, and processes.4  These and all related \nproject documents are publicly available.\n\nORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE\nSince its founding in 1966, ADB\u2019s headquarters \nhave been in Manila, Philippines. At the \nend of 2010, ADB had 67 member countries \n\n(shareholders), with 48 from Asia and the Pacific \n(\u201cregional members\u201d) and 19 from Europe and \nNorth America (\u201cnonregional members\u201d).5 \nThe largest shareholders are Japan and the \nUnited States, each with 15.6% shares in the \norganization. \n\nAt the apex of ADB\u2019s organizational structure \n(Box 1.1) is its Board of Governors, comprising \none representative and one alternate appointed \nby each of ADB\u2019s member countries.6 The Board \nof Governors meets formally once a year at an \nannual meeting held in a member country. The \nmembers elect their chairs and two vice- \nchairs yearly. \n\nADB\u2019s Charter (Article 28) vests all the powers \nof the institution in the Board of Governors. 7 Its \nday-to-day responsibilities are largely delegated \nto the Board of Directors, which performs its \nduties full-time at ADB\u2019s headquarters in Manila.\nAmong the powers that may not be delegated \n(Article 2), the Board of Governors (1) determines \nthe remuneration of the Board of Directors and \ntheir alternates and the salary and other terms \nof the President\u2019s contract; and (2) approves, \nafter reviewing the auditor\u2019s report, the general \nbalance sheet and statement of profit and loss.\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the \noverall direction of ADB\u2019s operations, including \napproval of policies, loans, grants, and \nguarantees.8  The 12 members of the Board of \nDirectors are elected by the Board of Governors. \nEight of the directors are elected by members \nfrom within the Asia and Pacific region, and \nfour are elected by members from beyond the \nregion. Each member of the Board of Directors \nappoints an alternate. To facilitate the conduct of \nADB\u2019s general operations, the Board of Directors \nhas established six committees (on audit, \ncompliance review, budget review, development \neffectiveness, ethics, and human resources).9  The \nBoard of Directors adopted its Code of Conduct \nto set forth principles and ethical standards for \nthe directors, alternate directors, temporary \nalternate directors, and the President in \n\n4      ADB Sustainability Report\n\n\fBox 1.1  Organization chart\n\nBoard of Governors\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nPresident\n\nManaging\nDirector General\n\nOperations Evaluation\nDepartment\n\nReview Panel\n\nVice-President\n(Private Sector\nand Co\ufb01nancing\nOperations) \n\nPrivate Sector\nOperations\nDepartment\n\nO\ufb03ce of \nCo\ufb01nancing\nOperations\n\nVice-President\n(Finance and \nAdministration)\n\nO\ufb03ce of\nthe Secretary\n\nO\ufb03ce of the\nGeneral Counsel\n\nBudget, Personnel \nand Management\nSystems Department\n\nO\ufb03ce of \nAdministrative\nServices\n\nController\u2019s\nDepartment\n\nTreasury\nDepartment\n\nO\ufb03ce of \nInformation Systems\nand Technology\n\nVice-President\n(Operations 1)\n\nVice-President\n(Operations 2)\n\nSouth Asia\nDepartment\n\nResident Missions:\nBangladesh\nIndia\nNepal\nSri Lanka\n\nResident Missions:\nAfghanistan\nArmenia\nAzerbaijan\nGeorgia\nKazakhstan\nKyrgyz\nPakistan\nTajikistan\nTurkey\nTurkmenistan\nUzbekistan\n\nEuropean \nJapanese\nNorth American  \n\nEast Asia\nDepartment\nResident Missions:\n\nPRC\nMongolia\n\nSoutheast Asia\nDepartment\n\nResident Missions:\n\nCambodia\nIndonesia\nLao PDR\nPhilippines\nThailand\nViet Nam\n\nPaci\ufb01c Liaison \n\nand Coordination \nO\ufb03ce\n\nPaci\ufb01c Subregional\n\nO\ufb03ce\n\nPapua New Guinea\nResident Mission\n\nSpecial Liaison\n\nO\ufb03ce in Timor-\nLeste\n\nCentral Operations\n\nEconomics and\nResearch Department\n\nCentral and West Asia \nDepartment\n\nVice-President\n(Knowledge\nManagement and\nSustainable\nDevelopment)\n\n \n \n\nRegional and\nSustainable\nDevelopment\nDepartment\n\nAsian Development\nBank Institute\n\nO\ufb03ce of the\nAuditor General\n\nSpecial Senior \nAdvisor (Infrastructure \nand Water)\n\nO\ufb03ce of \nAnticorruption \nand Integrity\n\nStrategy and Policy\nDepartment\n\nO\ufb03ce of Regional\nEconomic Integration\n\nO\ufb03ce of the Special\nProject Facilitator\n\nO\ufb03ce of Risk\nManagement\n\nDepartment of\nExternal Relations\n\nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.\nFor a list of management and senior staff, go to http://www.adb.org/About/management/asp.\n\nPart 1: ADB\u2014Strategy and Structure      5\n\n\fconnection with their status and responsibilities \nin ADB.10 \n\nADB\u2019s President chairs the Board of Directors and, \nunder its guidance, conducts ADB\u2019s business. The \nPresident is elected by the Board of Governors \nfor a 5-year term, and may be reelected. The \nPresident is \u201cresponsible for appointing and \ndismissing officers and staff members in \naccordance with regulations adopted by the \nBoard of Directors.\u201d11 The President is also the \nlegal representative of ADB.\n\nThe President heads a management team \n(termed \u201cManagement\u201d) comprising five Vice-\nPresidents and the Managing Director General.12 \nThey supervise the work of ADB\u2019s operational, \nadministrative, and knowledge departments. \n\nOur work is carried out by five geographically \norganized regional departments (covering East \nAsia, Central and West Asia, South Asia, Southeast \nAsia, and the Pacific) and the Private Sector   \nOperations Department. They are assisted by \ncrosscutting departments that provide advisory \nsupport. \n\nWe have 30 field offices\u2014including 24 resident \nmissions and offices serving individual \nclient countries; 3 regional missions; and 3 \nrepresentative offices (the map on pages vi\u2013vii \nshows our members and office locations).13 \nResident missions provide the primary contact \nbetween ADB and the client country. They help \nto develop and deliver our programs and supply \nrelevant and timely advice on local perspectives \nto staff based at headquarters. Regional missions \ncover more than one country, and representative \noffices liaise with nonborrowing members. Our \nannual report provides additional detail on our \norganization\u2019s structure.14\n\nCOUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGIES AND  \nTHE PROJECT CYCLE\nThe government of each client country routinely \nprepares national economic development \n\nand poverty reduction plans and strategies\u2014\nsometimes with ADB\u2019s assistance. We examine \nour role in supporting these national plans \nthrough macroeconomic, poverty, thematic, and \nsector analyses. We consult with key stakeholders \nat every stage of this process. The government \nthen requests our support based on this analysis, \ncountry priorities, and ADB\u2019s strategic agendas \nunder Strategy 2020.\n\nAfter consulting with other development \npartners to ensure good coordination and to \ndetermine synergies, the government and ADB \nreach agreement on the priorities and areas \nfor ADB to support. The result is a country \npartnership strategy and an accompanying \nbusiness plan for ADB\u2019s operations in the country, \nwhich is usually prepared for a 3-year period.\n\nThe country partnership strategy is submitted \nfor endorsement by our Board of Directors. \nThe country operations business plan, which \nis updated annually, is approved by ADB\u2019s \nmanagement team. When the client country and \nADB agree on the country partnership strategy, \nthe technical staff of our operational departments \ndesign the projects identified and prepare \ncomplementary technical assistance for policy \ndevelopment and institutional strengthening.\n\nProject design and implementation lies at \nthe core of our work, and the preparation of \na successful development project involves \nstrong engagement with the proponent \norganization, community support, and sound \ngovernance structures. All of this can only be \nachieved through committed attention to public \nconsultation, and we continue to actively seek \nparticipatory approaches.\n\nFigure 1.2 shows our project cycle for sovereign \noperations.15 The major modalities for ADB\u2019s \nfinancing are\n\u2022  project loans; \n\u2022 \n\nsector loans (for a sector or subsector as a \nwhole);\n\n6      ADB Sustainability Report\n\n\f\u2022  program loans (to improve a sector\u2019s \n\n\u2022 \n\nperformance by covering immediate costs of \npolicy adjustment);\nsector development program loans \n(combining investment and policy-based \nlending); and\n\n\u2022  private sector loans, equity investments, and \n\nguarantees.\n\nFigure 1.2  Country partnership strategy \nand the project cycle\n\nADB\n\nObjectives\n+\nOutputs\n\nClient\nCountry\n\nCountry Operations\nBusiness\nPlans\n\nCountry\nPartnership\nStrategy\n\nMonitoring\n+\nEvaluation\n\nInvestment\nDecisions\n\nDesign\n\nProject\nCycle\n\nMonitoring\n+\nEvaluation\n\nImplementation\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank.\n\nThe multitranche financing facility. In 2005, we \nintroduced on a pilot test basis the multitranche \nfinancing facility (MFF).16 The aim was to support \nour clients\u2019 medium- to long-term investment \nprograms while reducing costs that would \nhave been applicable to a series of individually \nprocessed loans. Because of the demand for the \nMFF, in June 2008, we mainstreamed the MFF into \nour operations.17 By the end of 2010, 53 MFFs had \nbeen approved for 13 client countries. \n\nAssessing results. At the close of a project, the \nimplementing department assesses its results \n\nin a completion report. Within a few years of \ncompletion, many projects are reviewed by \nthe Independent Evaluation Department to \ncheck whether project outcomes matched \nexpectations. Evaluation results feed back into \nplanning for ongoing and future projects, to \nimprove performance and outcomes. All of the \nevaluations are posted in a timely manner on  \nour website.18\n\nRegional integration. In addition to country-\nspecific projects, we support a wide range of \nefforts to enhance regional cooperation and \neconomic integration. This is one of our central \nmandates, based on our Charter, and we have \nsuccessfully organized programs of cooperation \nand information exchange pertaining to \nenvironment, health, disaster management, \ninfrastructure planning, connectivity, \nfinancial integration, and many other topics. \nPart 2 provides examples of such programs \nin environment, social development, and \ngovernance.\n\nSTRATEGY 2020\u2014ADB\u2019S LONG-TERM \nSTRATEGIC FRAMEWORK\nIn 2008, our Board of Directors approved Strategy \n2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the \nAsian Development Bank.19 This followed broad \nconsultations with our management team and \nstaff members and other stakeholders, including \nrepresentatives of ADB members, the private \nsector, and civil society.\n\nStrategy 2020 reaffirms both ADB\u2019s vision of an \nAsia and Pacific free of poverty and our mission \nto help our client countries improve their living \nconditions and quality of life.\n\nTo achieve this, under Strategy 2020 ADB \nsupports three complementary development \nagendas: \n(1) \n(2)   environmentally sustainable growth, and \n(3)   regional integration. \n\ninclusive economic growth, \n\nPart 1: ADB\u2014Strategy and Structure      7\n\n\fADB focuses on five drivers of change under  \nthe strategy: \n\u2022  private sector development and private \n\nto increase its value as a management tool and \ncascade the Strategy 2020 goals to work priorities \nat all levels of the organization. \n\nsector operations, \ngood governance and capacity development, \ngender equity, \nknowledge solutions, and \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022  partnerships. \nADB also has refocused its operations into five \ncore specializations that best support its agenda, \nreflect the client countries\u2019 needs and ADB\u2019s \ncomparative strengths, and complement efforts \nby development partners. The specializations are \ninfrastructure; environment, including climate \nchange; regional cooperation and integration; \nfinancial sector development; and education. \nIn other areas, such as agriculture, health, \nand disaster and emergency assistance, ADB \nwill continue operations selectively in close \ncooperation with  partner agencies. \n\nSignificant efforts are being made to put ADB on \ntrack to achieve the goals of Strategy 2020. ADB is \nworking to align its operational planning, human \nresources, institutional structure, policies and \nstrategies, and business processes with  \nStrategy 2020.\n\nManaging for \nDevelopment Results\n\nGuided by ADB\u2019s Managing for Development \nResults (MfDR) Action Plan for 2009\u20132011, we \nsharpened our focus on results in managing our \nentire business.\n\nWe continued to use the Strategy 2020 results \nframework to monitor our performance, identify \nissues, and adopt actions. ADB completed its \nfourth Development Effectiveness Review to \nreport our performance, and used the findings \nto prepare our work plans and budgets. Early \nin 2011, ADB will refine the results framework \n\nADB refined the guidelines on country and \nsector results frameworks to better align them \nwith the client countries\u2019 objectives and to \nimprove results monitoring. We upgraded our \nMfDR learning and development program and \nimplemented a new communications plan to \nsystematically disseminate messages on MfDR. \nIn 2010, we worked closely with five of our client \ncountries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Viet \nNam) to strengthen their capacities in MfDR. We \nalso supported the Asia\u2013Pacific Community of \nPractice on MfDR, the first regional network on \nresults management.\n\nREVIEWING OUR DEVELOPMENT \nEFFECTIVENESS\nADB has completed four Development \nEffectiveness Reviews, covering 2007\u20132010. By \nmeasuring performance using ADB\u2019s results \nframework, the review process drives informed \ndecision making on corporate management. The \n2010 review (Box 1.2) rates ADB\u2019s performance \nusing a scorecard reflecting progress against \nbaselines and targets in the results framework, \nand reports on our management team\u2019s actions \nfor improving ADB\u2019s performance. \n\nFor the 2010 review, we refined the results \nframework by introducing eight new indicators \nand replacing one of the old ones.20  These, and \nsome further refinements to definitions and \ntargets and the structure of the framework, were \napproved by our Board of Directors. \n\nThe 2010 Development Effectiveness Review \napplied an improved performance scorecard \nsystem, which provides more objective and \ntimely information to our management team. \nThe new system enables us to capture the \nlikelihood of attaining the targets of key \n\n8      ADB Sustainability Report\n\n\fBox 1.2  2010 Development Effectiveness Review\n\nThe Asian Development \nBank\u2019s fourth \nDevelopment \nEffectiveness Review \nconcluded that Asia and \nthe Pacific continued \nto make headway \nin reducing poverty, \nimproving gender \nequality, and achieving \nother development \noutcomes. However, \nprogress in many non-\nincome poverty indicators \nwas insufficient, and \nthe region is unlikely \nto achieve 6 of the 12 \nMillennium Development \nGoal targets that are \nincluded in the Strategy \n2020 results framework. \nMoreover, the recent \nreemergence of food price \ninflation may erode gains.

also \nconcluded that we made \nsteady progress toward \nmost of our operational \nand organizational \neffectiveness indicators in \n2010, and are on track to \nmeet our 2009\u20132012 output targets. However, an assessment of all recently completed operations \nfound that their success rates remained low and achievement of core sector outcomes had \ndeteriorated. We take these findings seriously, as they threaten our development effectiveness. \nWe will scrutinize the problems, identify lessons, and adopt corrective actions. We will also seek to \nmanage our business processes, human resources, and budget more effectively, and will strive to \ninculcate results-focused performance management throughout the organization.\n\nSource: http://www.adb.org/Documents/Reports/development-effectiveness-review/\n\nPart 1: ADB\u2014Strategy and Structure      9\n\n\fperformance indicators, in addition to showing \nannual change, as in previous such reviews. As \nADB approaches the target year of the results \nframework, incorporating target attainability into \nthe scorecard is essential. The 2010 review also \nuses an improved methodology for aggregating \nindividual performance indicators in the \nsummary performance scorecard.\n\nSTREAMLINING BUSINESS PROCESSES\nImproved business processes are essential for \neffectively implementing both ADB\u2019s overarching \ngoal of poverty reduction and Strategy 2020. \nMandated by Strategy 2020 and the plan \nfor implementing the 10th replenishment \nof the Asian Development Fund (ADF\u2014our \nconcessional lending window), we completed a \ncomprehensive review of our business processes \nin 2009. Based on the findings from the review, \nstarting in January 2010 we phased in new \nstreamlined processes for preparing the country \npartnership strategies (CPSs) and delivering \nloans. The streamlined business processes \naim to improve ADB\u2019s efficiency in delivering \nits development assistance while optimizing \nthe use of resources to achieve the maximum \ndevelopment impact.\n\nCPSs are ADB\u2019s primary platform for designing \noperations to deliver development results \nat the country level. The streamlined CPS \nbusiness processes now focus on identifying the \nintersection between the client country\u2019s national \ndevelopment strategy and ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020. \nThe new CPSs improve the fit between ADB\u2019s \ncore areas of specialization and the priorities and \nneeds of our client countries, and complement \nthe work of other development partners. For our \ninternal procedures, the streamlined business \nprocesses \n\u2022 \n\nintroduced repositories for sector and \nthematic knowledge, to make them more \naccessible;\nabolished multiple and redundant \ndocumentation; and \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nimproved quality assurance processes by \nintroducing a peer review system and top-\nlevel oversight. \n\nThe rapid growth of ADB operations resulting \nfrom the tripling of our capital base necessitates \nbetter and faster loan delivery. Slow loan \ndelivery means high transaction costs to \nclient countries, high administrative costs for \nADB, and lost development opportunities. \nTo enhance our responsiveness to clients, the \nstreamlined business processes merged the \ntwo-step processes previously required for \npreparing and implementing project preparatory \ntechnical assistance and for processing loans. \nAlso, detailed implementation arrangements \nare now discussed with the clients at the loan \nprocessing stage, so that projects may be readily \nexecuted when they have been approved by the \nBoard of Directors. As with the CPS process, the \ndocumentation requirement was rationalized, \nand the peer review process was introduced to \nenhance product quality. Finally, loan processing \nrequirements are differentiated according to risk \nand complexity. \n\nWith the streamlined business processes, we \nexpect that the preparation time prior to the \nBoard of Directors\u2019 approval of a loan may be \nreduced from an average of 24 months to 12 \nmonths, and the time from the approval to the \nfirst disbursement may be reduced from an \naverage of 12 months to 6 months. This could \nreduce the human resource requirements, in \nperson-hours per loan, by about 20% from  \n2009 levels.\n\nADB also developed an expanded menu of \nfinancing instruments available to our client \ncountries, to include (1) an expanded scope of \nthe current program loan policy to allow for \nbudget support, (2) financial crisis response, \n(3) supplementary financing, (4) cross-border \ninvestment (for regional cooperation and \ninvestment), (5) results-based lending, and (6) \nproject development. \n\n10      ADB Sustainability Report\n\n\fHARMONIZING DEVELOPMENT AGENCY \nPOLICIES AND PRACTICES\nImproved donor coordination has remained \na significant mechanism for harmonizing the \nefforts of multilateral development banks and \nbilateral aid agencies in line with the Paris \nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness.21 This is evident \nin both regional and country-level operations \nthrough initiatives such as harmonizing \noperational policies and methodologies, \ncomplementarity, cofinancing, policy dialogue, \nand joint review. We cooperate with the broader \ninternational development community to \nincrease attention to MfDR (Box 1.3) and we \nparticipate in the Multilateral Development Bank \nFinancial Management Harmonization Working \nGroup (Box 1.4). We continue to work with other \nmultilateral development banks (MDBs) to \nharmonize the MDBs\u2019 range of standard bidding \ndocuments and include terms and conditions \nthat increase the scope for clients to manage \ntheir sustainability and quality requirements. \nBorrowers will use these documents to specify \nthe minimum sustainability criteria or standards \nfor evaluating supplier bid packages for goods, \nworks, and services. The criteria include core \nenvironmental, labor, and gender safeguards. \nWe have worked with other MDBs to incorporate \ncore labor standards into the revised MDB FIDIC \ncontract for works, which was issued in 2010.22 \nADB continues to work with other MDBs to put \nin place procedures and systems to ensure that \nthese standards are implemented by contractors.\n\nGENERATING AND SHARING KNOWLEDGE\nKnowledge is a powerful catalyst for propelling \nand enhancing development. ADB\u2019s comparative \nstrengths\u2014expertise in identifying trends in \nthe region, capacity for interdisciplinary and \nintegrated approaches, and ability to blend \nknowledge and insight with policy advice and \nsupport for capacity development and with large \nconcessional financing\u2014place it in a strategic \nposition to generate and share knowledge. \nStrategy 2020 recognized this and underlined \n\nknowledge solutions as a driver of change in  \nthis decade.\n\nADB\u2019s Knowledge Management Action Plan, \n2009\u20132011, approved in 2009, was based from \nthe 2008 review of our knowledge management \nexperience. The plan provides entry points for \nspecific actions and outputs on sustainable \ndevelopment and directs efforts toward four \ndesired outcomes: sharpening the knowledge \nfocus in ADB\u2019s operations, empowering the \ncommunities of practice (CoPs\u2014groups that \ninteract and share learning on topics germane to \nADB\u2019s focal activities), strengthening partnerships \nwith knowledge groups beyond ADB, and \nenhancing learning and skills development  \nfor staff.\n\nSharpening the knowledge focus. ADB \npromotes closer ties between its operations and \nknowledge management efforts. At the regional \nlevel, ADB\u2019s flagship publications have helped \nstakeholders make informed decisions and \nreinforce ADB\u2019s image as a knowledge provider. \nFor example, our publication, Poverty, Inequality, \nand Inclusive Growth in Asia: Measurement, Policy \nIssues, and Country Studies, analyzes the pillars of \nan inclusive growth strategy.23\n\nAt the country and project levels, knowledge \ninitiatives have helped us mainstream in-depth \nanalysis of specific topics in CPSs and project \ndesigns. Examples include (1) the ongoing \nassessment of the Philippines\u2019 environment and \nnatural resources, which will present analyses and \nrecommendations focusing on natural resources, \nenvironmental health, and climate change; and \n(2) assessments of the climate, hydrological, \nand socioeconomic characteristics of Bangkok, \nHo Chi Minh City, and Manila, done jointly with \nthe Japan International Cooperation Agency \nand World Bank. At the institutional level, we \nincorporated new sector peer review procedures \nin our business processes, harnessing the rich \noperations-based knowledge of staff members. \n\nPart 1: ADB\u2014Strategy and Structure      11\n\n\fBox 1.3  High-level forums on aid effectiveness\n\nAs part of its commitment to support global efforts to enhance aid effectiveness, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) participated in \n\u2022 \n\nthe First High Level Forum in Rome in 2003, which identified a general framework for \nharmonizing and aligning development agencies\u2019 operations; \nthe Second High Level Forum, which produced the Paris Declaration; and \nthe Third High Level Forum, which endorsed the Accra Agenda for Action (AAA).\n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\nADB actively mainstreams Paris Declaration and AAA principles in its policies, strategies, and \ninitiatives. We monitor our progress in meeting the Paris Declaration targets annually through a \nsurvey. We also ensure that our staff members are kept abreast of the evolving aid effectiveness \nagenda and the application of good practices through regular learning and development \nprograms.\n\nThe Fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness (HLF-4) will take place in 2011 in Busan, \nRepublic of Korea. HLF-4 is a multistakeholder event that will draw conclusions on the Paris \nDeclaration and AAA process, and will assess whether the commitments and targets set for 2010 \nhave been met or not, and why. ADB will play a major role in organizing and supporting the \nevent and the preparatory activities. ADB is a member of the Executive Committee of the Working \nParty on Aid Effectiveness of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s \nDevelopment Assistance Committee (OECD\u2013DAC). As such, ADB is closely involved in steering the \npreparations and influencing the international agenda for the HLF-4.\n\nMore information is available at www.adb.org/Aid-Effectiveness.\n\nBox 1.4  Harmonizing financial management across organizations\n\nThe Multilateral Development Bank Financial Management Harmonization Working Group was \nformed in February 2001, to harmonize operational policies, procedures, and practices to improve \nthe effectiveness of their development assistance to clients. The group has three main areas of \nfocus: \n\u2022 \n\nharmonization between the members, for example, on financial reporting formats and \napproaches to selecting external auditors; \nglobal and regional harmonization, to foster good practices and harmonization of capacity \ndevelopment support for public financial management; and \ncountry-level harmonization, focused on supporting joint analytical work and harmonized \nsupport to strengthen country public financial management systems.\n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nSource: ADB.

CoPs keep know-how in \nsectoral and thematic domains alive by sharing \nand adapting knowledge to specific applications.\n\nADB hosts 13 formal and a greater number \nof informal CoPs that work on many topics.24 \nThe CoPs designed and delivered customized \ncourses for their members, assessed their own \neffectiveness, participated in global conferences \nand other forums, and collaborated with external \npartners in research and knowledge sharing.\n\nFor example, the Water CoP (Box 1.5) developed \nand delivered 10 training courses for its \nmembers in 2010. All 13 formal CoPs run their \nown knowledge sharing events, contribute to \nthe formulation of ADB\u2019s operational plans for \ntheir sector, and enrich the country partnership \nstrategies and project designs.\n\nStrengthening external knowledge \npartnerships. To foster stronger partnerships, \nADB has started to incorporate knowledge \ncomponents in new partnership agreements. We \nhave built a database of strategic partnerships \nfor use across ADB. A new course on learning in \npartnerships has been developed for delivery in \n2011, and Guidelines for Knowledge Partnerships \nhave been formulated to inform ADB\u2019s efforts to \nstrengthen partnerships and develop new ones.\n\nADB has also been partnering with a number \nof external institutions. For example, on \nenvironment, ADB has institutional partnerships \nwith the following organizations:\n\u2022  Global Environment Facility (GEF)\u2014at \n\nthe end of 2010 we were implementing \nwith GEF 20 projects benefiting the global \nenvironment and promoting sustainable \nlivelihoods in local communities; \n\nBox 1.5  Communities of practice for water\n\nFor the water sector, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) has a formal and an informal community of \npractice (CoP). The formal CoP, often referred to as the \nWater Committee, serves as a think tank. It is a small \ngroup that provides advice on strategic directions of \nADB\u2019s water operations.\n\nThe informal network, with over 200 members, is \ndedicated to achieving ADB\u2019s vision of Water for All. \n\nThe Water CoP regularly conducts seminars on \nwater issues and staff development programs for its \nmembers. Regular activities and outputs include \n\u2022 \nthe monthly Water CoP Catchment Series; \n\u2022  CoP Streams (rural, urban, and basin) meetings and \n\nseminars; \nconferences and dialogues; \ninternational water events; \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022  water articles by ADB experts; and \n\u2022  books, briefs, and brochures; multimedia \n\nresources; and papers. \n\nSource: http://www.adb.org/Knowledge-management/cops-internal.asp#water\n\nWater scarcity is a major issue in many \nplaces.\n\nPart 1: ADB\u2014Strategy and Structure      13\n\n\f\u2022  World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)\u2014for \nsharing knowledge and formulating \nsustainable development policies and \nstrategies (see also Box 2.18); and \n\n\u2022  United Nations Environment Programme \n(UNEP) and United Nations Economic \nand Social Commission for Asia and the \nPacific (ESCAP) to prepare the report Green \nGrowth, Resources and Resilience\u2014a major \nknowledge product for the Asia and the \nPacific region and an input to the Rio+20 \nprocess leading to the 2012 United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development \n(UNCSD).\n\nEnhancing staff learning and skills. Due to \nthe rapidly changing nature of development \nwork and the increasingly complex needs of \nclient countries, ADB surveys on knowledge \nmanagement always indicate a need for staff \nlearning and development. Thus, during 2009\u2013\n2010, we conducted several learning programs, \nsuch as on climate change and financing for ADB \noperations and on the new Safeguard Policy \nStatement.\n\nWe developed two training series\u2014the Learning \nfor Change Primers and Knowledge Management \nand Learning Series\u2014to promote knowledge \ngeneration and sharing. E-learning applications \nfor these series are planned for 2011. Further, we \nset up new collaboration mechanisms for cross-\ndepartmental and multidisciplinary knowledge \ngeneration and sharing.\n\nAdditional knowledge flows. In addition to our \nin-house Knowledge Management Center and \nknowledge hubs, we generate and share vital \ninformation with our client countries through a \nrange of other channels:\n\u2022 \n\nthe Asian Development Bank Institute, \nestablished in 1997 in Tokyo, helps build \ncapacity, skills, and knowledge related \nto poverty reduction and other areas \nthat help support long-term growth and \ncompetitiveness in our region;25\n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nour Economics and Research Department \ncontributes to economic knowledge through \nresearch and statistics; helps determine, \nthrough macroeconomic forecasting, \nthe development needs for Asia; and \ndisseminates the results;26 and\nour Office of Regional Economic Integration \nhelps client countries harness the full \nbenefits of global and regional financial \nintegration and disseminates the results to \npromote prudent economic management.27 \n\nPrivate Sector \nInvestment\u2014The Engine \nof Economic Growth\n\nPrivate sector investment is widely recognized \nas the engine of economic growth. The adoption \nof Strategy 2020 is a milestone for ADB\u2019s \n\u201cnonsovereign\u201d operations (loans to private and/\nor public sector entities), because it prioritizes \nprivate sector development as a key driver of \nchange in our operations. \n\nADB\u2019s programs and efforts help build an \nenvironment to enable heightened and sustained \nprivate sector participation in our region\u2019s \ndevelopment. We seek to provide a bridge \nbetween the public and private sectors to help \nsatisfy the investment needs of the Asia and \nPacific region while ensuring that private capital \nis channeled to meet the public interest (Boxes \n1.6 and 1.7).\n\nADB catalyzes private investments through \ndirect financing, credit enhancements, and \nrisk mitigation instruments. We provide direct \nfunding assistance through loans and equity \ninvestments. We also offer political risk guarantee \nand partial credit guarantee instruments to \nattract both foreign and local commercial lenders \nto projects in our client countries. Through \n\n14      ADB Sustainability Report\n\n\f\u2022 \n\ncofinancing and guarantees, we also support \nlocal investors, domestic banks, and financial \ninstitutions to provide funds on terms suitable for \nADB-assisted development projects. We mobilize \nadditional resources by enabling commercial \nbanks to benefit from our preferred creditor \nstatus for projects they finance with us.\n\nOur nonsovereign operations are focused on two \ncore areas of operations identified in  \nStrategy 2020:\n\nInfrastructure. Energy projects comprise \n52% of our private sector portfolio. \nWhile efficient carbon-based power \ngeneration remains important for meeting \nbase load demand in the region, we \nare increasingly investing in clean and \nrenewable technologies. ADB also supports \ninvestment in public\u2013private partnerships in \ntransport, telecommunications, and urban \ninfrastructure.\n\nBox 1.6  Developing clean energy with private sector financing\n\nContributing to global efforts to \npromote clean and renewable \nenergy development, in 2010, \nthe Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) approved its first two solar \nenergy projects. One of them, the \nBangchak Solar Power Project, \ninvolves constructing two solar \npower generation plants (totaling \n44 megawatts) in Ayutthaya \nProvince, Thailand. The project \nis sponsored by the Bangchak \nPetroleum Public Company and \nhas been financed on a corporate \nbasis by ADB and Mizuho \nCorporate Bank.\n\nGathering sunlight for energy at the Bangchak Solar Power \nProject, Ayutthaya, Thailand. The project is providing electricity \nto homes, schools, hospitals, and businesses. \n\nThe project will (1) diversify Thailand\u2019s energy mix by adding renewable energy capacity, helping \nthe country achieve its target of 20.3% of primary commercial energy coming from alternative \nenergy by 2022; and (2) demonstrate the feasibility of a large-scale private sector solar power \ngeneration project. The outcomes will be an increased supply of clean energy sourced from solar \npower and reduced carbon dioxide emissions. \n\nOur innovative risk participation structure has a catalytic effect as it enables an international \ncommercial bank to participate in long-term financing for solar projects in Thailand. The project \nwill play a pioneering role in demonstrating the commercial viability of large-scale private sector \nsolar farms, a model that can be replicated by other private sector investors in the region. \n\nSource: ADB. 2010.

In the midst of \nthe global financial crisis, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) dramatically \nstepped up assistance for trade \nfinance. \n\nThe TFP provides guarantees and \nloans through banks to support trade. \nBacked by its AAA credit rating, ADB \nworks with over 200 partner banks to \nprovide companies with the financial \nsupport they need to engage in \n\nSpice vendor in Bangladesh\n\nimport and export activities. By providing guarantees and loans within 24\u201348 hours, the TFP is \nestablished as a key player in providing fast, reliable, and responsive trade finance support.\n\nThe TFP supported $2.8 billion in trade in 2010 alone\u2014an increase of 46% from the $1.9 billion in \n2009\u2014about $1.2 billion was from ADB and $1.5 billion was through cofinancing. The TFP does \nnot assume risk in relatively developed markets such as the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, \nMalaysia, and Thailand, but focuses on the more challenging markets. The TFP operates in 16 \ncountries. In 2010, it was most active in Bangladesh, Viet Nam, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal, in \nthat order.\n\nSupporting intraregional and south\u2013south trade are important objectives for ADB. Of the TFP\u2019s \n783 transactions in 2010, 440 were intraregional and 386 were between client countries.\n\nThe TFP supported more than 270 small and medium-sized enterprises in 2010, slightly more \nthan in 2009. Such enterprises are a huge engine for job creation and private sector development. \nThe TFP supports billions of dollars of trade throughout the region, which in turn helps create \nsustainable jobs and prosperity in Asia\u2019s poorest countries.\n\nThe TFP won two industry awards in 2010, including, for ADB, \u201cBest Development Bank in Trade.\u201d\n\n\u2022  Capital markets. We focus on expanding \naccess to finance, particularly among \nlower income groups, and micro, small, \nand medium-sized enterprises. Our work \nsupports infrastructure development \nand provides climate change finance. The \nfinancial intermediaries we partner with \n\ninclude banks, nonbank financial institutions, \nand private equity funds. The ADB Trade \nFinance Program (Box 1.7) supports \nimporters and exporters in the region\u2019s \nmost challenging countries while furthering \nregional integration. \n\n16      ADB Sustainability Report\n\n\fOur nonsovereign projects have increased \nsignificantly in recent years and are being \nadministered in more than 20 client countries.\n\nMoving forward, ADB\u2019s private sector operations \nwill increasingly focus on smaller and less well-\nserved markets. We have committed to increase \nthe share of our private sector transactions \n(1) in countries that are eligible for our most \nconcessional financing rates,28 and (2) for clean \nand renewable energy. By 2015, our goal is \nthat 40% of the number of our private sector \ntransactions approved will be for such countries, \nand 25% of the transactions will be for clean and \nrenewable energy.\n\nThe Private Sector Operations Department \nreleased its Development Effectiveness Report \nin December 2010,29 the first in an annual series \nthat assesses and reviews performance trends \nand identifies actions required to improve results. \nThe report reviews how ADB\u2019s private sector \noperations have contributed to promoting its \noverall development effectiveness and offers an \nopportunity to reflect on the value that private \nsector operations contributed to achieving  \nADB\u2019s goals.\n\nBy 2020, 50% of ADB\u2019s lending is expected to be \nin private sector development and private sector \noperations.\n\nTransparency and \nAccountability\n\nOUR STAKEHOLDERS\nAs a public institution, ADB is accountable to its \nshareholders and other stakeholders. Contacts \nfor our management team and senior staff are \nposted on the internet.30 Our wide range of \nstakeholders includes our member countries, \ndevelopment partners such as multilateral and \nbilateral agencies, nongovernment organizations, \nand civil society. \n\nSEEKING STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT\nPublic communications. The Public \nCommunications Policy (PCP) guides our \nefforts to be transparent and accountable to \nthe people we serve.31 ADB\u2019s vision of an Asia \nand Pacific free of poverty cannot be achieved \nunless ADB is aware of its stakeholders\u2019 needs \nand they understand and support ADB\u2019s role and \noperations in the region. The right of people to \nseek, receive, and impart information and ideas \nabout ADB-assisted activities is fundamental \nto the PCP. Our website is the primary vehicle \nfor proactive disclosure of information. The \nPCP also calls for other means of information \ndissemination, depending on the intended \nrecipient, as well as the intended purpose for \ndisclosing the information.\n\nProgress in institutional transparency and \ndisclosure of project-related information \nhas been notable since the PCP took effect \nin September 2005. ADB has monitored \nimplementation of the PCP and published \nfour annual assessments of its progress.32 \nThese detailed assessments indicate our good \nprogress in adhering to the provisions of the \nPCP; promoting transparency, accountability, \nand improved communications; and making \nmore information available to a wide range of \nstakeholders. By the end of 2010, the number \nof documents posted on the ADB website had \nincreased by 125% since 2005 (versus a 70% \nincrease in 2009). The 2009 ADB Perceptions \nSurvey showed that a majority of the responding \nstakeholders thought that ADB communicates \nits mission and activities well, and has been \nresponsive to information requests.33 In 2010, all \nexternal requests received were responded to \nin an average of 4 days, an improvement from 7 \ndays in 2009 and well within the PCP requirement \nof 30 days. \n\nThe 2005 PCP requires a comprehensive review \nto be conducted 5 years after its effective date. \nWe launched the review in February 2010 to \nassess the PCP\u2019s efficacy, and to recommend \n\nPart 1: ADB\u2014Strategy and Structure      17\n\n\fchanges as necessary to improve and strengthen \nit. For the review, we requested input from all \ninterested parties by e-mail through the internet \nand conducted extensive consultations, actively \nengaging more than 500 stakeholders, including \nproject-affected people, in 12 member countries. \nTwo matrixes of comments available on the ADB \nwebsite indicate we have taken into account \nkey comments received during the consultation \nprocess.34 Based on the results, a paper is being \nprepared for consideration in 2011 by our Board \nof Directors.\n\nBEING ACCOUNTABLE  \nAND FIGHTING CORRUPTION\nBeing accountable for our projects. ADB\u2019s \nAccountability Mechanism was established \nto (1) provide a forum for affected people to \ncomplain about alleged harm or to request a \nreview of ADB\u2019s compliance with its policies \nand procedures, and (2) contribute to the \neffectiveness of ADB\u2019s development work and the \nquality of our projects. \n\nADB\u2019s Accountability Mechanism has two phases:\n\u2022 \nthe Office of the Special Project Facilitator\u2014\nwhich uses informal, consensus-based \napproaches to problem-solving;35 and\nthe Compliance Review Panel\u2014which \nindependently investigates claims of \nviolations of ADB\u2019s operational policies and \nprocedures.36 \n\n\u2022 \n\nBox 1.8 shows the steps involved in consultation \nand compliance review. In 2010, a joint working \ngroup of ADB\u2019s management team and Board \nof Directors commenced a review of the \nAccountability Mechanism. \n\nFighting corruption. A primary aim of ADB\u2019s \n1998 Anticorruption Policy is to ensure that \nour projects, and all entities and individuals \nworking on ADB-financed activities adhere to the \nhighest ethical standards.37 ADB staff members \naccomplish online the \u201cAnnual Declaration of \n\nCompliance,\u201d indicating they understand and \nadhere to ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy and \nassociated principles and guidelines.38 \n\nIn 2009, the Integrity Division was separated \nfrom the Office of the Auditor General and the \nOffice of Anticorruption and Integrity (OAI) was \nestablished to enhance the ability of the Integrity \nDivision to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s \nanticorruption policy. To handle the increasing \ncomplexity of its work, OAI was provided with \nadditional staff\u2014at the end of 2010, OAI had 18 \nstaff members, up from 12 at the end of 2008. \nOAI reports directly to ADB\u2019s President. In 2010, \n78% of staff members attended the \u201cSay No to \nCorruption\u201d briefings, and additional sessions are \nscheduled for 2011 to meet the target of 100% \nattendance.\n\nADB staff members are required to report \nincidences of fraud and corruption to OAI, which \nscreens and investigates the allegations. From \nJuly 1998, when ADB adopted its anticorruption \npolicy, to the end of 2010, 756 firms and \nindividuals had been debarred from working \nwith ADB (up from 549 in 2008) and another 42 \nreprimanded (11 more than in 2008).39 \n\nIn 2008\u20132009, OAI consolidated and updated \nADB\u2019s whistleblower provisions, and harmonized \nits approach with the best practices of \ncomparator institutions.40  Administrative \nOrder 2.10 on \u201dWhistleblower and Witness \nProtection\u201d (issued in December 2009) clarified \nand reconfirmed ADB\u2019s position that appropriate \npolicy frameworks can contribute to achieving \nsignificant progress in fighting corruption. Since \nthe Administrative Order was issued, 49% of \ncomplaints were brought to OAI\u2019s attention by \nADB staff members, an increase from 33% in \n2009.\n\nWe achieved a major milestone in our fight \nagainst corruption in April 2010, when we signed \nthe Cross-Debarment Agreement with the \nAfrican Development Bank, European Bank for \n\n18      ADB Sustainability Report\n\n\fBox 1.8  Flowchart of the Accountability Mechanism\n\nStart of the \nConsultation Process\n\nSTEP 1: Filing of the\ncomplaint\n\nSTEP 2: \nRegistration and \nacknowledgment of \nthe complaint\n\nSTEP 3: \nDetermination of \neligibility of the \ncomplaint\n\nSTEP 4: Review and \nassessment of the \ncomplaint\n\nSTEP 5: Decision by \nthe complainant to \ncarry on with the \nconsultation process\n\nSTEP 6: Comments \non findings by \nthe operations \ndepartment and \nthe complainant; \nRecommendations \nby the Special \nProject Facilitator\n\nSTEP 7: \nImplementation of \nthe course of action \nin the consultation \nprocess\n\nSTEP 8: Termination \nof the consultation \nprocess\n\nIf complaint \nis found \nineligible, \nthe \ncomplainant \nmay file a \nrequest for \ncompliance \nreview\n\nIf the \ncomplainant \nfinds the \nconsultation \nprocess not \npurposeful, \nthe \ncomplainant \nmay file a \nrequest for \ncompliance \nreview\n\nIf the \ncomplainant \nfinds the \nconsultation \nprocess \npurposeful \nbut has \nserious \nconcerns \nabout \ncompliance \nissues, the \ncomplainant \nmay file a \nrequest for \ncompliance \nreview\n\nReconstruction and Development \n(EBRD), Inter-American Development \nBank, and World Bank Group.41  From \n9 June 2010 when ADB declared the \nAgreement in force until the end \nof 2010, we have submitted 4 firms \nand 10 individuals to the World Bank \nand EBRD for cross-debarment, and \nhave cross-debarred 6 firms and 2 \nindividuals sanctioned by the World \nBank.

OCR consists primarily \nof proceeds from borrowings, paid-in capital \nprovided by our member countries, and funds \nderived from our operations. OCR resources are \nreplenished by borrowings from international \nand domestic capital markets, and OCR loans are \noffered at near-market terms to lower-to-middle \nincome borrowing countries. \n\nThe largest of our special funds is the Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF), a major instrument \nof concessional financing in the Asia and Pacific \nregion.43 The ADF provides loans at very low \ninterest rates and grants that help reduce poverty \nin client countries with low per capita income and \nlimited debt repayment capacity.44 The poorest \n\ncountries are entitled to receive a large portion \nof their ADF project funding as grants. The ADF \ngrants program allocates funding to high-priority \ntechnical assistance projects and activities in \npoor countries that are debt-stressed or in post-\nconflict situations, and to combat HIV/AIDS and \nother infectious diseases.\n\nThe Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction45 and \nADB\u2019s Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector46 \nare other important trust funds. The Japan fund \nprovides grants to support innovative poverty \nreduction and related social development \nactivities that can add value to ADB\u2013financed \nprojects. Several donor-members finance the \nwater fund, which was established to help \ncatalyze implementation of ADB\u2019s Water Policy,47 \nemphasizing promotion of effective water \nmanagement policies and practices.\n\nTable 1.1 shows investment by sector from OCR \nand ADF resources. Year-on-year comparisons \ncan sometimes be misleading, because a major \nprogram in one sector in a given year can inflate \nfigures. However, the increasing trend in OCR \nenergy sector investments reflects growing \ndemand for energy efficiency and renewable \nenergy projects. Likewise, in ADF the increased \ninvestments in the environment reflects a \nheightened appreciation for the need to address \nenvironmental concerns (see Part 2).\n\nCofinancing. The generation of external funds \nused to complement ADB financing is another \nway in which we aim to broaden and deepen our \nefforts.48 We now have cofinancing arrangements \nwith 40 development partners, for loans and \ngrants. Cofinancing arrangements significantly \nincrease the value added by ADB projects (Figure \n1.3), and contributed over $8.1 billion in financing \nto ADB projects during 2009\u20132010.\n\nFUNDING SOURCES\nADB raised, through public offerings, private \nplacements, and other transactions, $10.4 billion \n\n20      ADB Sustainability Report\n\n\f1.2\n\n0.0\n\n16.3\n\n12.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n12.6\n\n12.9\n\n2.4\n\n7.7\n\n4.8\n\n4.5\n\n2.6\n\n2.6\n\n8.4\n\n29.1\n\nOrdinary capital resources\n\nAgriculture and Natural \n\nResources\n\nEducation\n\nEnergy\n\nFinance\n\nHealth and Social Protection a\n\nIndustry and Trade\n\nPublic Sector Management b\n\nMultisector\n\nTransport and \n\nCommunications\n\nWater Supply and Other \n\nMunicipal Infrastructure \nand Services c\n\nAsian Development Fund\n\nAgriculture and Natural \n\nResources\n\nEducation\n\nEnergy\n\nFinance\n\nHealth and Social Protection a\n\nIndustry and Trade\n\nPublic Sector Management b\n\nMultisector\n\nTransport and \n\nCommunications\n\nWater Supply and Other \n\nMunicipal Infrastructure \nand Services c\n\nTable 1.1  Financing by sector and source, 2006\u20132010\n\nSource and sector\n\n$ million % $ million % $ million % $ million % $ million %\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n450\n\n0\n\n1,198\n\n1,635\n\n0\n\n200\n\n800\n\n7.5\n\n0.0\n\n20.0\n\n27.3\n\n0.0\n\n3.3\n\n101\n\n0\n\n1,312\n\n978\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1,021\n\n13.4\n\n1,043\n\n2,423\n\n27.8\n\n1,860\n\n16.9\n\n385\n\n0\n\n108\n\n39\n\n150\n\n4.4\n\n0.0\n\n1.2\n\n0.4\n\n1.7\n\n290\n\n0\n\n500\n\n50\n\n0\n\n2.6\n\n0.0\n\n4.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n246\n\n0\n\n2,306\n\n1,120\n\n0\n\n0\n\n670\n\n2.7\n\n0.0\n\n25.5\n\n12.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n7.2\n\n1,545\n\n1,212\n\n17.7\n\n13.9\n\n4,800\n\n1,224\n\n43.6\n\n11.1\n\n1,294\n\n14.0\n\n1,235\n\n20.6\n\n3,446\n\n42.7\n\n2,572\n\n29.5\n\n1,823\n\n16.6\n\n3,280\n\n35.5\n\nSubtotal\n\n5,992\n\n8,073\n\n8,705\n\n11,006\n\n9,250\n\n474\n\n7.9\n\n172\n\n2.1\n\n271\n\n3.1\n\n458\n\n4.2\n\n334\n\n3.6\n\n350\n\n251\n\n97\n\n102\n\n10\n\n20\n\n80\n\n27.5\n\n19.7\n\n7.6\n\n8.0\n\n0.8\n\n1.6\n\n6.3\n\n46\n\n145\n\n92\n\n85\n\n50\n\n50\n\n159\n\n551\n\n58\n\n130\n\n39\n\n10\n\n172\n\n18\n\n400\n\n670\n\n3.2\n\n7.3\n\n2.2\n\n0.6\n\n9.6\n\n1.0\n\n22.4\n\n37.4\n\n261\n\n11.8\n\n154\n\n85\n\n10\n\n43\n\n101\n\n506\n\n185\n\n7.0\n\n3.8\n\n0.5\n\n1.9\n\n4.6\n\n22.9\n\n8.4\n\n368\n\n70\n\n148\n\n143\n\n177\n\n0\n\n225\n\n257\n\n16.6\n\n3.2\n\n6.7\n\n6.5\n\n8.0\n\n0.0\n\n10.2\n\n11.6\n\n198\n\n15.6\n\n480\n\n25.3\n\n162\n\n9.1\n\n515\n\n23.3\n\n551\n\n24.9\n\n165\n\n13.0\n\n236\n\n12.5\n\n131\n\n7.3\n\n351\n\n15.9\n\n273\n\n12.3\n\nSubtotal\n\nTotal\n\n1,272\n\n7,264\n\n1,893\n\n9,966\n\n1,790\n\n10,494\n\n2,210\n\n13,216\n\n2,213\n\n11,463\n\nNotes: Figures exclude terminated loans.

This replenishment \namount is significantly higher than the $7 billion \nagreed for the 2005\u20132008 period.49 \n\nRaising Capital Resources. Because of ADB\u2019s \nstrong credit fundamentals and conservative \nfinancial policies, we are a leading AAA credit \nrated borrower and raise funds regularly through \ninternational and domestic capital markets. \nThis allows us to borrow at favorable rates and \nthen pass on low-interest financing to our OCR \nborrowers. We invest our liquid assets primarily \nin government and government-related \ndebt instruments, time deposits, and other \nunconditional obligations of banks and financial \ninstitutions.\n\nAt the end of 2010, ADB had about $156 billion in \ncapital stock (versus about $66 billion at the end \nof 2008), comprising\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\n$144 billion in subscribed capital, and\nalmost $12 billion in reserves available to \nprotect ADB\u2019s creditors in the event of a \nlarge-scale default by borrowers.\n\n22      ADB Sustainability Report\n\n\fPart 2\nThe Environment, \nSocial Development, \nand Governance\n\n\fThe Environment, \nSocial Development, \nand Governance\n\nAs an integral part of achieving its mission of \neliminating poverty in Asia and the Pacific, the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) works to enhance \nthe environment, improve the region\u2019s social \ndevelopment, and foster good governance. This \npart of the report focuses on our operations that \ndirectly impact these areas in our client countries.\n\nEnvironmental \nSustainability\n\nENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES  \nFACING ASIA AND THE PACIFIC\nAsia and the Pacific has made some progress \nduring 2009\u20132010 toward addressing its \nmany environmental challenges, especially in \nrenewable energy and responses to climate \nchange. However, the environment in Asia and \nthe Pacific continues to be weighed down by \nthe effects of robust economic growth in a few \ncountries and pervasive poverty in many others. \nThe result is rising urban air and water pollution; \ngrowing soil erosion, desertification, and water \nscarcity; and increasing loss of endangered \n\nspecies, vital natural habitats, and resources. The \nadditional effects of climate change\u2014shortages \nof water and food, and greater risks to health and \nlife\u2014are already evident and are expected to \nexacerbate these environmental problems in  \nthe future. \n\nThe expansion of Asia\u2019s urban populations and \naccompanying levels of congestion, poverty, \nand pollution are major challenges. Some \nimprovements have been made, yet up to a \nthird of Asian city dwellers live in overcrowded \nslums and informal settlements with poor \naccess to services such as water and sanitation.50 \nConcentrations of most principal air pollutants \nalso remain well above internationally accepted \nbenchmarks, and cities are a major contributor to \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\n\nAlong with urbanization, increasing \nindustrialization is linked to intensive use of \nenergy and natural resources, and pollution. \nBetween 1995 and 2005, material consumption \nin the Asia and Pacific region grew by 50%, from \n23.6 billion tons to about 35.3 billion tons.51 Since \nthe mid-1990s, the region has accounted for well \nover half of global material use, overtaking all \n\n24      \n\n\fthe other regions combined. The rate of growth \nin GHG emissions has also accelerated, mirroring \nthe trends in overall material and energy use. \nThese trends are expected to continue, with \ndeveloping countries of Asia accounting for 45% \nof global energy-related emissions by 2030.52 \nWhile products from natural or agricultural \nsystems support rural incomes and provide \nthe food and commodities for Asian cities and \nbeyond, a product and commodity orientation \nhas encouraged an undervaluation of the many \nservices provided by natural ecosystems and \nbiodiversity. \n\nThe degradation of these public goods across the \nregion translates into a loss of productive assets \nand reduces the efficiency and resiliency of the \nservices they provide. Biodiversity is being lost \nat unprecedented rates. Demands for freshwater \ncontinue to rise, resulting in competition among \nkey sectors and ultimately between countries \nthat share transboundary freshwater systems. \nCoastal and marine ecosystems are in decline. \nThe increasing impacts of climate change are \nleading to ecosystem collapse in major coastal \nand oceanic regions.53 \n\nClimate change is acknowledged as a real \nthreat to the economic prosperity of the region. \nAverage temperatures are predicted to rise and \nthe frequency and intensity of extreme weather \nevents are likely to increase. Thus, the region, \nwhich is already prone to natural disasters, will \nexperience more typhoons, floods, and droughts, \nand increased risks of crop failures, heat waves, \nand other hazards. The forecasted sea level rise, \nwarmer ocean temperatures, and increasing \nocean water acidity will raise the risks of coastal \nerosion and threaten coastal and marine \necosystems. The hardest hit areas will include \ncoastal cities and communities, low lying islands, \nfragile mountain ecosystems, and arid and semi-\narid lands.\n\nMEETING THE CHALLENGES\nEnsuring the environmental sustainability of \neconomic development in Asia and the Pacific \nis a high priority for ADB. Indeed, the Strategy \n2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of \nthe Asian Development Bank reaffirms the \nimportance of economic growth that is inclusive \nand environmentally sustainable and of regional \nintegration to achieve poverty reduction and \nimprovements in the quality of life for people in \nAsia and the Pacific. As one of the five core areas \nof Strategy 2020, environment is increasingly \nintegrated across ADB\u2019s operations and \ninvestment portfolio. \n\nIn line with Strategy 2020, central emphasis is \nbeing placed on climate change, liveable cities, \nand a range of complementary and supportive \nactions aiming at improving environmental \npolicies, knowledge, and management capacities \nat country, subregional, and regional levels. To \neffectively pursue this agenda and given ADB\u2019s \nexperience, our operations in environment, \nincluding climate change, have three mutually \nsupporting strategic directions: (1) promoting \ntransitions to sustainable infrastructure, (2) \nimproving natural resource management \nand maintaining ecosystem integrity, and (3) \nbuilding sound environmental governance and \nmanagement capacities. Our Addressing Climate \nChange in Asia and the Pacific: Priorities for Action \ndetails the integrated approach we will take for \nresponding to the causes and consequences of \nclimate change.54\n\nThe number of projects specifically directed \ntoward environmental improvement has \nsteadily increased, as shown in Figures 2.1 and \n2.2. In 2010, we approved 50 loan projects \nwith environmental sustainability as a theme, \ntotaling about $4.8 billion\u2014this is a 52% \nincrease in number over 2009, and the highest \nsince 1995.

Degraded land diminishes the \nlivelihoods of the poor and may result in clouds \nof dust and sand being sent to distant countries. \nAcid rain and airborne mercury and dioxin from \ncoal-fired power plants and industry waft across \nnational boundaries, damaging forests and crops \nand threatening human health. The territory \nof many river basins includes several countries \nwith shared responsibilities. Forests support the \ndaily life of local and indigenous communities, \nwhile at the same time sequestering carbon from \nthe atmosphere, regulating water flows, and \nserving as sources of crops and medicines. The \nproductivity of oceanic fisheries in one country \noften depends on the sound management of \nestuaries, reefs, and nursery grounds in the \nwaters of another. Nations must work together on \nthese issues or all lose.\n\nIn the Asia and Pacific region, ADB is currently \nsupporting important regional programs \nthat are designed to address environment \nand development issues on an ecosystem \nscale. Working with multiple partners, \nincluding sovereign governments, civil society \norganizations, and local communities, ADB\u2019s \nefforts support policy dialogue and capacity \ndevelopment at regional and national levels \nto help mainstream environment and climate \nchange considerations within development \npolices and plans, while supporting resource \nmobilization and partnerships to demonstrate \nand upscale new approaches.\n\nIn the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), ADB \nworks with representatives from all Mekong \ncountries, as well as other partners, through \n\nthe GMS Core Environment Program to assess \nand address the most important environmental \ndimensions of that subregion\u2019s rapid economic \nexpansion. This effort is managed by the GMS \nEnvironment Working Group, comprising \neconomic and environmental authorities from \neach of the six cooperating countries. The \nprogram is demonstrating the best ways to \nmitigate the subregional impacts of key sectoral \ndevelopment programs, such as those dealing \nwith energy and transport, and pays particular \nattention to biodiversity conservation through \nthe Biodiversity Conservation Corridors Initiative \n(Box 2.3). \n\nAnother example of regional cooperation efforts \nis the Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI) on Coral Reefs, \nFisheries, and Food Security. Launched in 2007 \nby Indonesian President Yudhoyono, the CTI is \na six-country program\u2014involving Indonesia, \nMalaysia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, \nSolomon Islands, and Timor-Leste\u2014to protect \nand sustainably manage an area often referred \nto as \u201cthe Amazon of the seas.\u201d The Coral Triangle \nholds more than 75% of the world\u2019s known \ncorals, over 3,000 species of fish, and the greatest \nextent of mangrove forests on Earth; supports \nthe livelihoods of over 120 million coastal \npeople; and provides more than $3 billion in \nannual foreign exchange income from fisheries \nexports and coastal tourism revenues. The marine \nand coastal resources of the Coral Triangle are, \nhowever, at immediate risk from a range of \nfactors, including the impacts of climate change, \noverfishing, unsustainable fishing methods, and \nland-based sources of pollution.\n\nTo address these threats, the six governments \nhave collaborated to develop a regional plan of \naction that was endorsed by the heads of each \ncountry at a historic CTI Summit in May 2009. In \naddition, each country has developed a national \nplan of action and supportive coordination \nmechanisms. ADB serves as an active partner and \nlead for mobilizing the considerable resources \nneeded to support this program. At the end of \n\nPart 2: The Environment, Social Development, and Governance      29\n\n\fBox 2.3  Supporting biodiversity in the Greater Mekong Subregion\n\nThe Greater Mekong \nSubregion (GMS) Program \nwas established in 1992 by \nsix countries\u2014Cambodia, \nthe People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, \nMyanmar, Thailand, and \nViet Nam, with the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) as \nthe program\u2019s secretariat. \n\nThe GMS has achieved some \nof the highest growth rates \nglobally. This demands new \nmanagement approaches \nand tools to ensure that \nenvironmental concerns \n\nFarming on the slopes of the Annamite mountains, Greater \nMekong Subregion\n\nare adequately addressed in cross-border initiatives and properly integrated into the subregion\u2019s \neconomic development efforts. In response, GMS government leaders endorsed the Greater \nMekong Subregion Core Environment Program and Biodiversity Conservation Corridors Initiative \n(CEP\u2013BCI). The CEP\u2013BCI is facilitated by ADB and receives financial support from the governments \nof Finland, the Netherlands, and Sweden. \n\nSince the CEP\u2013BCI\u2019s inception in April 2006, it has successfully \n(1)  established six pilot biodiversity conservation corridors, bringing over 2 million hectares of \nland under sustainable management regimes\u2014this has enhanced ecosystem connectivity \nand services (including carbon sequestration estimated at 100 million tons of carbon dioxide) \nwhile improving livelihoods of local communities; \n\n(2)  pilot tested three strategic environmental assessments as a tool to influence upstream \n\nplanning and optimize decision making\u2014the assessments were conducted for sectoral plans \nin Cambodia (tourism) and Viet Nam (hydropower), and area-based plans in the GMS North\u2013\nSouth Economic Corridor; \n\n(3)  prepared and secured funding for scaling up the CEP\u2013BCI and climate change mitigation \n\ninterventions to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation; \n\n(4)  strengthened institutional capacities within the environment ministries and sectoral agencies \nfor carrying out environmental performance assessments and spatial multicriteria analysis for \nland use management; and \ninstituted sustainable financing mechanisms, including commune- and village-level revolving \nfunds, and supported countries to pilot test payments for ecosystem services.\n\n(5) \n\n30      ADB Sustainability Report\n\n\f2010, more than $300 million in new financial \nresources had been mobilized, with financial and \ntechnical support provided by ADB, the Global \nEnvironment Facility (GEF), the governments \nof Australia and the United States, the United \nNations Development Programme (UNDP), and \nthe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) \nof the UN. Several international environmental \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), including \nConservation International, The Nature \nConservancy, and the World Wide Fund for Nature \n(WWF), are also providing active support through \ntheir own resources; and bilateral and multilateral \npartners are funding selected projects. \n\nPROMOTING LOW CARBON  \nECONOMIC GROWTH \nAsia and the Pacific progressed well during \n2009\u20132010 in developing and adopting \nrenewable energy technologies. For example, \nthe PRC mandated and achieved more than 19% \nreduction in its energy intensity below its 2005 \nlevel by 2010, and has formulated a target of \nreducing its energy intensity by an additional \n17% during 2011\u20132015.56 India has adopted a \nrange of long-term policy support programs \nfor low carbon development\u2014and, under \nIndia\u2019s National Action Plan on Climate Change, \na mission was launched in 2010 to install 20 \ngigawatts of solar power generation capacity \nby 2022. Under our Addressing Climate Change \nin Asia and the Pacific: Priorities for Action,57 our \ninvestments related to climate change will focus \non climate change mitigation and adaptation, \nfacilitated by financing, knowledge generation, \nand partnerships. The strategic priorities are \nexpanding the use of clean energy; encouraging \nsustainable transport and urban development; \nmanaging land use and forest for carbon \nsequestration; promoting climate-resilient \ndevelopment; and strengthening related policies, \ngovernance, and capabilities.\n\nThe region\u2019s current energy needs are \nmet primarily by burning fossil fuels, with \n\nnegative economic, environmental, and social \nconsequences. This adds considerably to the \nglobal accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) \nin the atmosphere\u2014a root cause of global \nwarming\u2014and dependency on fossil fuels \nexposes countries to global price and supply \nfluctuations that can undermine their energy \nsecurity. The PRC is now the world\u2019s largest GHG \nemitter and, with India and other large Asian \neconomies, the region will soon overtake Europe \nand North America as the largest source of GHG \nemissions. Combustion of oil, gas, and coal emits \nlarge amounts of CO2 and local air pollutants \nto the atmosphere. Our region already shows \nimpacts attributed to climate change. Energy \nsecurity can be improved and air pollution \nreduced by increasing the efficiency of energy \nproduction and using alternative sources of \nenergy, which will also mitigate GHG emissions. \n\nIn response to these needs, in 2009, our Board of \nDirectors approved the new ADB Energy Policy.58 \nThe policy is a coherent translation of Strategy \n2020, which prioritizes energy-related objectives \nand identifies the institutional capabilities \nneeded for the future within a changing \nregional, global, and technological context. The \nnew Energy Policy aims to help clients provide \nreliable, adequate, and affordable energy for \ninclusive growth in a socially, economically, and \nenvironmentally sustainable way. The policy\u2019s \nthree pillars are\n\u2022  promoting energy efficiency and renewable \n\nenergy; \n\n\u2022  maximizing access to energy for all; and\n\u2022  promoting energy sector reform, capacity \n\ndevelopment, and governance. \n\nThe policy guides ADB operations in the energy \nsector by aligning them to meet energy security \nneeds, facilitate a transition to a low carbon \neconomy, and achieve ADB\u2019s vision of a region \nfree of poverty. The policy prioritizes support \nfor improvements in energy efficiency and for \nrenewable energy projects and broadens the \nreach to many sectors. This is expected to ease \n\nPart 2: The Environment, Social Development, and Governance      31\n\n\fthe growth in demand for fossil fuel use and \nthe pressure to increase energy prices, improve \nenergy security, and reduce GHG emissions.\n\nProviding clean energy. ADB is increasingly \nresponding to country requests for investments \nin and help with developing the policies, \nregulations, and institutions needed to facilitate \na shift to clean energy. Special attention is being \ngiven to identifying and eliminating barriers \nto the adoption of new technologies for low \ncarbon energy production and improved energy \nefficiency. To support this, we have established \nseveral interlinked initiatives and programs, \nincluding the Clean Energy Program and Carbon \nMarket Program.\n\nThe Energy Efficiency Initiative, approved in April \n2005 to push ADB\u2019s clean energy investment to \n$1 billion a year starting in 2008, has evolved \ninto the Clean Energy Program59 with a new \nyearly target of $2 billion of clean energy \ninvestment from 2013. The program now focuses \non supporting clean energy in our smaller client \ncountries and on facilitating the adoption of low \ncarbon technologies through the region. ADB\u2019s \nclean energy investment has progressed well\u2014\nfrom $226 million in 2003 to average $1.2 billion \nyearly in 2007 and 2008, and to average over $1.6 \nbillion yearly in 2009 and 2010.\n\nThe Carbon Market Program60 (formerly the \nCarbon Market Initiative approved in April 2006) \naims at helping client countries benefit from \nthe growing global market for trade in certified \nemissions reductions credits generated by \nclean energy projects in developing countries \nunder the terms of the Kyoto Protocol.61 The \nCarbon Market Program supports the design and \ncofinancing of eligible projects and helps market \ncredits generated up to 2020, beyond the first \ncommitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, which \nends in 2012.\n\nThe clean energy and carbon market programs \nare helping the region\u2019s economies generate \nenergy more efficiently, curb the growth of \n\nenergy use, and promote low carbon energy \noptions. Several ADB regional initiatives and \nprojects are promoting demand- and supply-side \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy.\n\nEnhancing energy efficiency. On the energy-\ndemand side, ADB is fostering efficiency \nimprovements across the industrial, commercial, \nand municipal sectors through activities such \nas promoting the use of more efficient lighting, \ncooling, and space heating. In the transport \nsector, we are advancing the use of mass \ntransport systems, more efficient vehicles, cleaner \nfuels, and sound urban mobility planning.\n\nOur Clean Energy Program has several initiatives \nthat focus on accelerating the use of low \ncarbon technologies, including (1) the Asia \nSolar Energy Initiative and its proposed $500 \nmillion fund, intended to catalyze greater levels \nof investment in solar energy (Box 1.6); (2) the \nQuantum Leap in Wind Initiative, which aims \nto promote deployment of wind power in the \nAsia and Pacific region, targeting an additional 1 \ngigawatt of electricity from wind power during \nthe next 5 years; (3) the Asia Climate Change \nand Clean Energy Venture Initiative to increase \nthe investments of venture capital funds in \nclean energy start-ups; and (4) the Low Carbon \nTechnology Marketplace, which will broker \nconnections between prospective buyers and \nsellers to accelerate the transfer of low carbon \ntechnologies to the region. \n\nIn addition to the Carbon Market Initiative, we \nare providing access to a range of innovative \nfinancing mechanisms to scale up investments in \nnew and cleaner technologies (Box 2.4). The Asia \nand Pacific region will require billions of dollars to \nmake the transition to low carbon growth paths \nand adapt to the unavoidable impacts expected \nfrom climate change. \n\nFacilitating access to energy. Along with \nwidespread support for clean energy, our Energy \nPolicy also stresses the need to widen the access \nto energy. In developing Asia, 800 million people \n\n32      ADB Sustainability Report\n\n\fBox 2.4  Reducing emissions from thermal generation\n\nRapid economic growth and \nextensive coal consumption in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) have caused major local and \nglobal environmental concerns, \nincluding increased greenhouse \ngas (GHG) emissions. Because coal \nis expected to remain the PRC\u2019s \ndominant source for producing \nelectricity in the foreseeable \nfuture, the efficiency of the \ncountry\u2019s coal-based power plants \nshould be improved, inefficient \ncoal-based plants closed, and new \npower plants that use advanced \ntechnology developed.\n\nOne of the many needs for clean energy: light to study by\n\nIn response to this need and a request from the PRC government, in February 2010 the Asian \nDevelopment Bank provided support to construct a 250 megawatt integrated gasification \ncombined cycle power plant. This is recognized as the most efficient and least polluting \ntechnology for generating power from coal. \n\nOn completion, the plant will generate 1,470 gigawatt-hours of electricity, save about 134,000 \ntons of coal use, and thus reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 372,000 tons annually.

Rapid \nurbanization, rising incomes, and a surge in \nthe use and number of vehicles have worsened \ntraffic congestion across Asia\u2019s urban areas. As \ntraffic increases, so does the consumption of oil-\nbased fuels and the generation of GHGs. Other \nimpacts include a declining quality of life in the \nregion\u2019s cities due to congestion and local air \npollution. Alternatives to cars, such as public \ntransport systems (including bus rapid transit) \nand bikeways, are required, as are policies and \ntechnologies to boost vehicle fuel efficiencies. \nSuch alternatives will generate local and global \n\nPart 2: The Environment, Social Development, and Governance      33\n\n\fBox 2.5  Clean energy for Bhutan\n\nBhutan is trying to reach 100% \nelectrification by 2013.

Another essential \npart of climate change mitigation is capturing \n\u201cfugitive\u201d GHG emissions, often arising from \nindustrial equipment leaks or evaporative \nprocesses. We are assisting this effort through \nseveral regional initiatives and projects. We are \nfocusing on the capture of methane, which is \n24 times more potent than CO2 as a GHG. Once \ncaptured, methane can be converted to a less \npowerful GHG and then used to replace more \ncarbon-intensive fuels such as coal and kerosene. \n\nAttention is also turning to enhancing \necosystems\u2019 abilities to absorb GHGs. Forests \nand organic matter in soils act as a \u201csink\u201d for \nCO2 drawn from the atmosphere and thus play \na critical role in maintaining the earth\u2019s CO2 \nbalance. Land-use changes that disrupt forests \nand soils can greatly affect the earth\u2019s natural \nability to store and release carbon. GHG emissions \nfrom deforestation in countries such as Indonesia \nand Papua New Guinea can be significant on a \nglobal scale. \n\nTo address emissions from land-use change, ADB \nis assisting several forest conservation projects, \nsupporting sustainable development that will \nintegrate forest protection and sustainable \nuse while also capturing benefits from carbon \nsequestration and biodiversity conservation  \n(Box 2.7). \n\n34      ADB Sustainability Report\n\n\fBox 2.6  Supporting efficient and sustainable urban transport\n\nThe urban transport system in Kathmandu, Nepal, \nneeds upgrading so that it is more efficient \nand sustainable, and to mitigate air pollution. \nA project that the Asian Development Bank \napproved in 2010 will help Kathmandu to improve \nits transport system by integrating all urban \ntransport components.

More people are at risk from adverse \nclimate change impacts in this region than in \nany other, and people who are already most \nvulnerable to poverty are likely to be the most \nseverely affected. Climate change is expected to \nhave adverse effects on water, food, fuel, health, \neducation, and access to social services. Loss of \nsecurity and livelihoods will force many Asians \nto migrate, and many small island states may see \ntheir very existence under threat from sea  \nlevel rise. \n\nAsian and Pacific countries must devise \nappropriate measures to respond to the \nprojected impacts of climate change. Failure to \ndo so will result in severe social costs and will \nhamper poverty reduction efforts. Adjusting to \nthe need for climate-resilient development will \nmean building responses to the physical, social, \n\nPart 2: The Environment, Social Development, and Governance      35\n\n\fBox 2.7  Realizing REDD+: Managing land use and forests for carbon sequestration\n\nManaging land use to maintain or \nsequester carbon is a major climate \nchange issue in Asia and the Pacific, \nwith land use changes accounting \nfor 15%\u201320% of global greenhouse \ngas (GHG) emissions. In Southeast \nAsia, changes related to land use \nare responsible for as much as 75% \nof total GHG emissions; and in the \nPacific many Asian Development \nBank (ADB) member countries are \nrapidly losing their forests.\n\nMeeting at the grassroots level to discuss environmental \nmanagement\n\nNew financing opportunities \nand incentives for reducing GHG \nemissions from deforestation and \nforest degradation (REDD) have been created under the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change (UNFCCC). The approach, known as REDD+, includes sustainable forest \nmanagement, the enhancement of forest carbon stocks, and the protection of biological diversity \nand ecosystem functions, while supporting and safeguarding local and indigenous livelihoods. \n\nIn response, ADB is supporting targeted activities to develop REDD+ capacity and models at \nthe regional, national, subnational, and local levels. The Biodiversity Conservation Corridors \nInitiative in the Greater Mekong Subregion and the Heart of Borneo Initiative focus on \nreducing deforestation and supporting the livelihoods of indigenous peoples and other forest \ncommunities. Both are expected to serve as platforms for further REDD+ support financed \nthrough the Forest Investment Program under the Climate Investment Funds, for which Indonesia \nand the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic are pilot countries. \n\nIn the Philippines, the Integrated Natural Resources and Environmental Management Project will \nprotect and restore biodiverse forest watersheds. Two projects in the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2014\nthe Jiangxi Sustainable Forest Ecosystem Development Project and the Forestry and Ecological \nRestoration in Three Northwest Provinces Project\u2014are also attending to the conservation and \nenhancement of forest carbon stocks.\n\nFinancial support includes $6 million from ADB\u2019s Climate Change Fund and contributions from \nthe Global Environment Facility (GEF). These funds are linked to ADB investments in coordination \nwith other multilateral and bilateral programs such as the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility and \nCollaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in \nDeveloping Countries\u2014the UN-REDD Programme.\n\n36      ADB Sustainability Report\n\n\fand economic impacts predicted from climate \nchange into all aspects of development decision \nmaking, planning, and investment. \n\nIn line with Addressing Climate Change in Asia and \nthe Pacific: Priorities for Action, our strategy for \nclimate change, we emphasize (1) main- \nstreaming adaptation and disaster risk \nreduction into national development plans and \ncountry partnership strategies; (2) building the \nclimate resilience of vulnerable sectors such \nas agriculture, energy, transport, and health, \nincluding preparation of climate-resilient sector \nroad maps; and (3) assisting countries to climate \nproof projects to ensure the outcomes are not \ncompromised by climate change and variability \nor by natural hazards in general. 64 \n\nThe primary modalities by which ADB \nimplements its adaptation agenda are (1) \nmobilizing and innovating to meet financial \nneeds, (2) generating and disseminating \nknowledge, and (3) cultivating and fostering \npartnerships. We made significant progress in \neach of these areas in 2010.\n\nFinance for adaptation. The multilateral \ndevelopment banks developed the Climate \nInvestment Funds (CIFs) as an interim measure \nto scale up assistance to developing countries in \nresponding to climate change, and to strengthen \nthe knowledge base in the development \ncommunity on mechanisms for climate change \naction. The CIFs are implemented jointly by the \nAfrican Development Bank, ADB, the European \nBank for Reconstruction and Development, the \nInter-American Development Bank, and the \nWorld Bank Group.65 \n\nThe two trust funds under the CIFs are the Clean \nTechnology Fund and the Strategic Climate Fund. \nThe Clean Technology Fund promotes programs \nto initiate a shift toward clean technologies and \nthe Strategic Climate Fund supports targeted \nprograms to pilot test new climate or sectoral \napproaches with that could be scaled up though \n\nthree windows: the Pilot Program for Climate \nResilience, the Forest Investment Program, and \nthe Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program in \nLow Income Countries. The CIFs are now playing a \nkey role in meeting international climate change \nobjectives with activities in 45 countries.\n\nADB continues to expand its efforts to support \ncountry-driven climate change adaptation \nprograms. In 2010, we approved 36 grants \nand technical assistance projects and 20 loans \nrelated to climate change adaptation or with \nclimate change adaptation components. We have \nsupported a wide range of adaptation activities \nby grant financing, both from internal resources \nand a growing number of multilateral and \nbilateral funds.\n\n\u2022  Under the technical assistance project, \n\nPromoting Climate Change Adaptation in \nAsia and the Pacific, we are pilot testing \napproaches and developing practical tools \nfor adaptation and to improve national \ncapacity to mainstream adaptation in \ninvestment planning. Another technical \nassistance project,66 approved in 2010, \nis promoting the integration of climate \nresilience into national and sector planning \nprocesses and funding vulnerability \nassessments and adaptation strategies for \nsectors and river basins.\n\n\u2022  Under ADB\u2019s Climate Change Fund, in 2010, \n\n\u2022 \n\nwe committed an additional $4 million to the \n$10 million already allocated to 11 projects \nfor adaptation to climate change.\nFor Bangladesh and Tajikistan, ADB \nand partners have developed strategic \nprograms for climate resilience, funded \nthrough the Pilot Program for Climate \nResilience of the CIFs. The program aims at \nproviding incentives for scaled-up action \nand transformational change in integrating \nthe consideration of climate resilience in \nnational development planning, consistent \nwith poverty reduction and sustainable \ndevelopment goals. Similar programs are \n\nPart 2: The Environment, Social Development, and Governance      37\n\n\fbeing prepared for Cambodia, Nepal, and  \nthe Pacific.67 \n\n\u2022  As an Executing Agency of the Global \nEnvironment Facility (GEF), ADB assists \ncountries to access GEF windows for funding \nadaptation efforts\u2014the aim is to increase \nresilience to climate change at national, \nsector, project, and community levels. \nProposed projects include developing \nclimate-resilient infrastructure and \nmanagement in India and Viet Nam.  \nIn June 2010, ADB was accredited by \nthe Adaptation Fund Board as one of its \nmultilateral implementing entities and we \nare soliciting proposals for financing under \nthe Adaptation Fund.68 \n\n\u2022 \n\nWater resources and land management. The \nAsia and Pacific region is particularly vulnerable \nto the projected impacts of climate change on \nthe water sector. River basins are specifically \nvulnerable, as the melting of glaciers leads to \nreduced water security for hundreds of millions \nof people, while increased rainfall variability leads \nto greater risks of floods, droughts, and other \nextreme events that adversely affect the quality \nand reliability of both surface and ground water. \nIn coastal areas, rising sea levels and consequent \nsalinity intrusion will worsen the degradation of \naquifers. Climate risks exacerbate the existing \nstresses on the region\u2019s water resources due to \nrapid economic development, demographic \nchanges, and associated increase in water \ndemand. \n\nReducing vulnerability to the likely impacts \nof climate change is one of the most pressing \ndevelopment challenges facing the region. \nRecognizing this challenge, ADB is responding \nthrough a wide range of finance and technical \nassistance activities to achieve \u201cclimate-ready\u201d \nprojects, cities, and river basins. Representative \nprojects include promoting integrated water \nresources management and climate change \nadaptation strategies in India; providing \nstructural and nonstructural water sector climate-\n\nproofing measures in Khulna, Bangladesh; \nupgrading water resources management \ninfrastructure and institutions in the Citarum \nRiver basin in Indonesia; and climate proofing \nwater and energy projects in the Indus River \nbasin in Pakistan. The Citarum River basin project \nhas served as a flagship project using integrated \nwater resources management as an adaptation \nprocess. Box 2.8 describes our partnerships for \nwater and climate change.\n\nGenerating and disseminating knowledge. \nAdaptation tools and methods are being \nprepared and pilot tested to assess the \nvulnerability of projects to climate change \nimpacts and/or to climate proof vulnerable \ninvestments. The tools and methods include  \n(1) for project preparation, a screening checklist \nthat provides a rapid risk assessment for all \nhazards; (2) adaptation sector briefs; and  \n(3) technical notes on \u201chow to do climate \nproofing\u201d (for transport and agriculture) to assess \nclimate risks, evaluate impacts and adaptation \ncosts, and prioritize responses. We are also \nexpanding our regional studies of the economics \nof climate change: Southeast Asia was completed \nin 2009; studies of the Pacific client countries, \nSouth Asia, and East Asia are under way; and the \nstudy of Central and West Asia is being proposed. \nPathbreaking climate impact and vulnerability \nassessments were completed in the urban and \nenergy sectors in 2010. A study of climate change \nimpacts on Ho Chi Minh City to 2050 examined \nstructural and nonstructural options for building \nclimate resilience.\n\nNetworking and partnerships. We are working \nclosely with governments, international \ninstitutions, bilateral agencies, NGOs, and other \ndevelopment partners to improve knowledge \nand understanding of the impacts of climate \nchange and options for effective adaptation \nresponses. For example, we continue to \ncollaborate with the United Nations Environment \nProgramme (UNEP), the Institute for Global \nEnvironment Strategies, and other partners \n\n38      ADB Sustainability Report\n\n\fBox 2.8  Partnering for water and climate change\n\nThe Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) has established, maintains, \nand participates in partnerships \nfor water and climate change.

The \nAsia Pacific Adaptation Network \n(APAN) is a regional knowledge \nsharing and capacity development \nmechanism that is part of the \nGlobal Adaptation Network. \nAPAN was launched in October \n2009 during the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate \nChange (UNFCCC) Bangkok Climate \nChange Talks. APAN is facilitated \n\nDelegates at the \ufb01rst Asia-Paci\ufb01c Climate Change Adaptation \nForum, in October 2010, Bangkok, Thailand\n\nby the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Asian Institute for Technology, Institute for Global \nEnvironment Strategies, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and other partners. \n\nAPAN aims to build climate resilience by mobilizing knowledge and technologies to support \ncapacity development, policy setting, planning, and dissemination of best practices for adaptation \nto climate change. APAN activities are undertaken by its regional hub, subregional nodes, and \npartner institutions in the Asia and Pacific region. ADB is particularly supporting the enhancement \nof APAN\u2019s web portal (www.asiapacificadapt.net) and facilitating knowledge exchange among \ngovernments, development partners, and other stakeholders. \n\nThrough APAN and the Regional Climate Change Adaptation Knowledge Platform for Asia, we \nhelped organize the first Asia\u2013Pacific Climate Change Adaptation Forum (21\u201322 October 2010, in \nBangkok). At the forum, more than 550 participants shared their knowledge about and experience \nwith mainstreaming adaptation into development planning in the region.

While the \nregion currently generates about 25% of the \nworld\u2019s gross domestic product, it also accounts \nfor 42% of global economic losses and 85% of \n\ndeaths from natural hazard impacts. In addition, \npeople in Asia and the Pacific are four times more \nlikely to be affected by natural hazards than \ntheir counterparts in Africa, and 25 times more \nvulnerable than Europeans or North Americans. \nAnd the future may not be much better: a recent \nreport by the World Bank and UN suggests that \nannual disaster losses could triple by the end of \nthe current century, even without calculating the \nimpact of climate change.69 Because two-thirds of \nthe disasters in Asia and the Pacific are weather-\n\n40      ADB Sustainability Report\n\n\frelated, the effects of climate change could result \nin a significant upsurge in the frequency and \nintensity of damaging events, which will prolong \nefforts to reduce poverty. \n\nIntegrating disaster risk management. Sound \nrisk management tools and policies can address \ndisaster risks more effectively when they are \nactively planned for, managed, financed, and \n(in some cases) transferred. This requires an \nintegrated approach that combines proactive \ndisaster risk management and disaster risk \nfinancing with traditional post-disaster aid. \nIntegrated disaster risk management is an \napproach that links a series of proactive risk \nmanagement tools and policies to manage \nnatural hazards and to reduce the impacts of \ndisasters. ADB is developing its framework for \nintegrated disaster risk management based on \nthree pillars: disaster risk financing, focusing on \ndeveloping finance capacity and instruments; \ndisaster risk reduction, focusing on enhancing \nhazard management and disaster prevention; \nand climate change adaptation, focusing on \nincorporating adaptation goals and opportunities \ninto initiatives for integrated disaster risk \nmanagement. \n\nWith more than half of the world\u2019s population \nliving in cities, assuring that urban areas are \nresilient to hazards and disasters will become \nincreasingly important for the vast majority of \ndevelopment and adaptation efforts. Moreover, \nprogress toward sustainable development must \nultimately take place in the context of local \ndecision making and through the roles of local \nactors. Local development planning processes \nwill be an increasing area of focus for ADB in \norder to meet our Strategy 2020\u2019s goals for \nwork with subnational levels of government. \nTo facilitate the work on urban resilience, we \nwill explore city-level options for disaster risk \nfinancing, identify options for managing land use \nto avoid risks, and identify drivers of urban risk \nand opportunities to address their root causes \nthrough effective urban governance. \n\nVillagers in Basti Panjanwala, Pakistan, cross \ufb02ooded \nroads and \ufb01elds to get food and supplies during the \nmassive 2010 \ufb02oods. \n\nResponding to disasters. Under ADB\u2019s \nDisaster and Emergency Assistance Policy, our \napproach is to identify disaster risks during \ncountry programming, build disaster and \nhazard management capacity at the country \nlevel, and take those risks into account when \ndeveloping country programs and investments, \nas well as to support regional coordination and \nharmonization. The Asia Pacific Disaster Response \nFund that was under consideration in 2008 \nwas established in April of 2009. The fund has \nincreased ADB\u2019s capability to provide immediate \nsupport to member countries that suffer large-\nscale impact, and has been used six times since \nits inception. \n\nSocial Development\n\nADB actively supports social development \nprograms in many Asian and Pacific countries. \nProviding education targeted to a population\u2019s \nneeds is basic to long-term development, and \nwithout good health, people cannot live happy \nand productive lives or make full use of their \n\nPart 2: The Environment, Social Development, and Governance      41\n\n\fskills or other assets. To achieve good health and \nperform to their potential, people need adequate \nnutrition through access to sufficient food. \nWomen\u2019s access to and control over natural and \nother resources is crucial to their own survival \nand well-being as well as that of their households \nand communities. Thus, we pay close attention to \ngender considerations in all of our work to help \nredress continuing inequalities. We especially \nwork to provide poor and disadvantaged groups \nwith access to essential basic services so they can \nattain a good quality of life and be productive \nmembers of society. By enhancing capabilities \nand facilities for education and health, promoting \ngender equality, and facilitating access to food, \nwe are building long-term capacities to improve \nthe quality of life and transmit these benefits to \nfuture generations. \n\nADVANCING OPPORTUNITIES FOR EDUCATION\nGood quality, inclusive education is essential to \nbuilding human capabilities and a well-skilled \nlabor force to underpin a modern, competitive \neconomy. For this reason, ADB has identified \neducation as a core area of operations. In 2010, \nADB prepared Education by 2020: A Sector \nOperations Plan, which identifies key challenges \nconfronting the developing countries of Asia and \nthe Pacific, and presents our response to assisting \ncountries in meeting those challenges.70\n\n\u2022 \n\nIn line with Strategy 2020, ADB\u2019s education work \nhas five main priorities: \n\u2022 \n\nIncrease and continue to align our support \nfor education to meet the changing needs \nand priorities of our client countries. \nEmphasize quality, inclusiveness, and \nrelevant skills at all levels of education. We \nwill help to boost the quality of education \nand move toward universal secondary \neducation, institute broad policy reforms \nand capacity development, strengthen \nsocial protection measures that assist girls \nand disadvantaged students to attend \nschool, support postsecondary education, \nand ensure that technical and vocational \n\neducation and training contribute to filling \nlabor market gaps and meeting the needs of \ninformal sector workers. \n\n\u2022  Adjust subsector priorities while recognizing \nmajor differences in education needs across \ncountries. We will support comprehensive \nprograms to improve basic, secondary, and \npostsecondary education. \n\n\u2022  Use new and innovative models of service \ndelivery and financing. We will use public\u2013\nprivate partnerships as a way to improve the \nquality and cost efficiency of education, and \nsupport client countries\u2019 efforts to increase \nthe use of information and communication \ntechnology in education service delivery.\nPromote regional cooperation and cross-\nborder collaboration. We will facilitate labor \nmobility by supporting initiatives to provide \nneeded education and skills.\n\n\u2022 \n\nIn pursuing the five priorities, we will strengthen \nknowledge sharing; concentrate on achieving \nmeasurable results; and cultivate partnerships \nwith other development agencies, education \ninstitutions, and private sector actors. ADB\u2019s Work \nProgram and Budget Framework (2010\u20132012) \nenvisions that education sector assistance will \nrise to $1.5 billion, or about 4% of total ADB \nprogramming for loans and grants. From 2012, \nwe will build on this base and substantially \nincrease lending for education. We will also \npursue cofinancing arrangements with other \ndevelopment agencies and the private sector.\n\nTable 2.2 presents the progress of our education \nlending in the last 5 years by subsector. We \nresponded to client countries\u2019 demands for \na significant increase in assistance for higher \neducation and workforce skills development. \n\nThe Southeast Asia subregion continues to \nreceive the dominant share of our investments \n(the subregion received 73% of loans and grants \nand 42 % of technical assistance during 2009\u2013\n2010).

The efficient operation of labor \nmarkets is important in the region because \ninformal employment is now a major source \nof income in most communities\u2014especially \nin urban areas. Thus, labor market policies and \nprograms form an important part of our social \nprotection strategy,71 and Strategy 2020\u2019s \nagenda to promote inclusive social development \nemphasizes greater access to economic \nopportunity by improving the productivity of \nthe workforce and expanding human capacities \nthrough investments in education, health, and \nbasic social protection (Box 2.10). The task is \ndaunting. By 2030, the region\u2019s labor force will \nneed to absorb 420 million new workers.\n\nDecent working conditions. Decent working \nconditions help reduce poverty, raise living \nstandards, and enhance the inclusiveness and \nsustainability of economic growth by increasing \nproductivity. In promoting good labor relations, \nwe are guided by the internationally recognized \ncore labor standards. We are committed to \nsupporting the application of these standards \nas part of our Social Protection Strategy, and \nmost of our client countries, as members of the \nInternational Labour Organization (ILO), are \nalso held to respect, promote, and realize the \nfundamental core labor standards. We published \nthe Core Labor Standards Handbook72 and Labor \nIssues in Public Enterprise Restructuring73 to guide \nADB staff and other stakeholders in dealing \nwith labor concerns, and we carry on an active \ndialogue with trade unions and with the ILO to \naddress issues that concern workers and the \nlabor market. Loan agreements for our projects \ninvolving works contain assurances that the \ncontractors will comply with the borrowing \ncountry\u2019s labor laws and related international \ntreaty obligations, will not employ child or forced \nlabor, will provide men and women equal wages \nfor equal work, and will apply other provisions as \nappropriate.\n\nPart 2: The Environment, Social Development, and Governance      43\n\n\fBox 2.10  Enhancing skills through vocational training\n\nThe Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic needs to modernize \nits economy and provide more \nemployment for its people. To \ndo so, the country must work to \nremedy significant issues of limited \nhuman resources, weak capacity, \nand skills shortages in the labor \nforce.

ADB contributes to gender-\nrelated activities at the country level through \ncountry partnership strategies, projects, technical \nassistance, policy dialogue, and capacity \ndevelopment. \n\nADB operations contribute to achieving MDG 3 \n(promoting gender equality and women\u2019s \nempowerment) and MDG 5 (improving maternal \nhealth). Progress toward achieving MDG 3 and \nits related indicators remains mixed.74 Gender \n\nequality in primary school enrollment is high, \nwith most of our client countries having ratios of \n0.95 or more, but fewer achieve gender equality \nin secondary and especially tertiary enrollment. \nWomen\u2019s representation in national parliaments \nhas been growing across the Asia and Pacific \nregion; however, a few countries still have no \nwomen in their national parliaments. Progress \ntoward MDG 5 has been significantly slower \n(Figure 1.1). Maternal mortality ranges from 2 \nper 100,000 live births in Hong Kong, China and \n45 in the PRC to more than 300 in Bangladesh, \nIndia, Indonesia, and Pakistan and over 1,800 \nin Afghanistan.

In 2008, Strategy 2020\u2019s Results \nFramework provided an organizational \naccountability mechanism for gender \nmainstreaming in all areas of ADB operations. \nThe Results Framework set an ambitious target \nthat 40% of all our projects, and 50% of all \nprojects we finance through the concessional \nAsian Development Fund, will have a gender \ntheme or effective gender mainstreaming by \n2012. Our projects are categorized by their \ndegree of gender mainstreaming at the time \nof approval according to set criteria as having \n(1) a gender equity theme, (2) effective gender \nmainstreaming, (3) some gender benefits, or  \n(4) no gender elements. Projects classified in \nthe first categories count toward the targets. We \nachieved these targets for the first time in 2010, \nwith gender mainstreaming in 42% of overall \nprojects and 53% in Asian Development Fund \noperations. Figure 2.3 shows the trends in the \n\ngender category composition of ADB\u2019s loans and \ngrants portfolio during 2006\u20132010. \n\nWe have diversified our gender mainstreaming \nportfolio by sector, modality, and geographical \nregion. Education, health, water supply and \nsanitation, environment, and natural resources \nmanagement projects consistently and effectively \nmainstream gender. Innovative strides have \nalso been made for gender mainstreaming in \nother sectors. Efforts to mainstream gender \nissues in policy-based and multitranche program \nmodalities have also been increasingly successful \n(Box 2.11).\n\nADB continues to scale up its internal capacity \nfor gender mainstreaming with the recruitment \nof additional gender specialists and effectively \nprovides relevant support to executing agencies. \nTraining workshops contribute to increasing \nstaff members\u2019 awareness of gender-responsive \nproject design and implementation, and our \nGender Equity Community of Practice plays \nan active role in managing and disseminating \nknowledge about gender issues. In addition, we \ncontinue to strive toward increased capacity and \neffectiveness in monitoring results of action to \nenhance and ensure gender equality. \n\nPart 2: The Environment, Social Development, and Governance      45\n\n\fBox 2.11  Gender-responsive policy-based loans and grants\n\nWomen may be bypassed by social \nservices that are not targeted \nspecifically and appropriately for \nthem. As a result they suffer, and so \ndo their families. \n\nTo remedy this, a program in \nBangladesh includes enhanced \ngender targeting as one of the \npolicy reform areas to improve the \neffectiveness of service delivery, \nparticularly for social safety net \nprograms supported by the overall \n\nprogram. One of the program\u2019s targets is that 20% more women will be covered by social safety \nnet programs targeted at them. To achieve this, conditions for the release of the first tranche \nrequire that the government finalize gender budgeting guidelines and submit the gender \nbudgeting report to Parliament. A second tranche condition is that at least 20 ministries that have \nadopted the medium-term budget framework will have adopted gender budgeting guidelines. \n\nIn the Social Sectors Support Program in Mongolia, as part of the measures to improve targeting \nmechanisms of social welfare programs, gender-based proxy means testing will be conducted. A \nsex-disaggregated national database of social welfare program recipients will be developed and \ncapacity development programs for gender analysis will be held for the National Statistical Office \nand relevant line ministries, including the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour.\n\nSources: ADB. 2009.

The region\u2019s vulnerability to hunger and \nfood insecurity was made particularly apparent \nduring the food crisis of 2007 and 2008. FAO data \nindicate the effects of soaring food prices have \n\nbeen felt most acutely in our region, where two-\nthirds of the world\u2019s hungry people reside.77\n\nBuilding on the hard lessons learned during \nthat crisis and noting that there are no shortcuts \nto achieving food security, ADB approved \nin December 2009 the Operational Plan for \nSustainable Food Security in Asia and the Pacific \nfor 2010\u20132012.

The plan also commits ADB to increased \nbut focused support for agricultural research and \ninnovations for development and to strengthen \npartnerships with other development agencies, \nfor enhanced synergy and harmonization in food \nsecurity work. \n\nThe Operational Plan for Sustainable Food \nSecurity targets $2 billion a year for investments \nrelated to food security, harnessing our \ncomparative strengths in the infrastructure, \nenvironment, regional cooperation, finance, \nand education sectors. For 2010, ADB approved \napproximately $2 billion in investments and \ntechnical assistance projects related to food \n\nsecurity. Box 2.13 illustrates some of the approved \ninvestments that demonstrate the new directions \nof our investment operations in this area. \n\nReliable and transparent food trade systems and \nmeasures to stabilize food prices are significant \npublic goods, particularly for the poor. Thus, \nADB supports policy reforms and advocacy \nrelated to food security for the region, to improve \ncommodity market operations and reduce \nexcessive price volatility. A key activity is our \npartnership with the ASEAN+378 in implementing \nthe Integrated Food Security Framework in \nthree areas\u2014improving region-wide market \ninformation, strengthening rice market trade, and \ndeveloping regional rice reserve systems  \n(Box 2.14). \n\nPart 2: The Environment, Social Development, and Governance      49\n\n\fADB\u2019s recent knowledge products pertaining to \nfood markets include the relationship between \nfinancial and commodity markets; transmission of \nworld food prices to domestic markets; leakage, \ndiversion, and excess costs of food subsidies; and \nthe potential for Southeast Asia to cater to the \ngrowing food demand from the PRC. \n\nADB began to monitor food and fuel \ncommodities and financial markets in 2010 to \nrespond to requests from client countries for up-\nto-date information, assessments, and economic \nanalyses of the implications that market \nvolatilities have for macroeconomic and social \ndevelopment of the region. Such knowledge \nequips ADB to provide good policy advice to help \nclient countries adapt to and mitigate the impact \nof high and volatile commodity prices and to \nstrengthen their policy making. \n\nWe continue to provide long-term financing to \nsupport research in the food security challenges \npertaining to productivity, connectivity, and \nresilience. For 2010, ADB committed $6 million to \nkey international agriculture research centers for  \n(1) the production and promotion of knowledge \nproducts that will reduce rice yield losses due \nto poor pre- and post-harvest management \npractices and technologies, (2) technology \ninnovations required for producing more food \nwith less water use, and (3) development of a \nworkable action plan and Asian priority agenda \nfor agriculture research for development. \n\nWe actively promote the building of partnerships \nand innovative approaches to ensuring food \nsecurity in the region. For 2010, ADB, FAO, and the \nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development \n(IFAD) organized Food for All: Investment Forum \nfor Food Security in Asia and the Pacific. More \nthan 400 participants from the public and private \nsectors, civil society, and the international \ncommunity participated in the forum. As a \nresult of the forum, the heads of ADB, FAO, and \nIFAD signed the Asia and the Pacific Regional \nFood Security Partnership Framework. ADB also \ncontributed to the Asia Society and International \n\nRice Research Institute Joint Task Force report, \nNever an Empty Bowl: Sustaining Food Security \nin Asia,79 by disseminating the policy findings \nof the Task Force report in developing Asia. \nAnd we actively participated in developing and \nstructuring the Global Agricultural and Food \nSecurity Program with the World Bank as the \ntrustee.\n\nPromoting Good \nGovernance \n\nENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS\nWe place a great deal of importance on our \nsafeguard policies because they seek to avoid, \nminimize, or mitigate adverse environmental \nimpacts, social costs to third parties, and \nmarginalization of vulnerable groups that may \nresult from development projects. Safeguard \npolicies are requirements to \u201cdo no harm\u201d that \nmust be met for all projects, and their provisions \nare not negotiable.\n\nSafeguard Policy Statement. ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (SPS) was approved by the \nBoard of Directors in 2009 and came into effect \nin January 2010.80 The SPS reaffirms ADB\u2019s \ncommitment to ensure social and environmental \nsustainability of development projects we \nsupport, and the SPS emphasizes the need to \nassist client countries to strengthen their own \nsystems to address environmental and social \nissues. Despite the increased number of projects \nand the inclusion of several new safeguard \nrequirements that were not covered under the \nprevious safeguard policies, our transition to the \nSPS in 2010 was smooth and effective.\n\nSafeguard policy principles and requirements. \nThe SPS builds on the three previous safeguard \npolicies on the environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples, and brings \nthem into a consolidated policy framework \nthat enhances their effectiveness and relevance. \n\n50      ADB Sustainability Report\n\n\fBox 2.15  Policy principles and requirements of the Safeguard Policy Statement\n\nThe Safeguard Policy Statement sets up \nsafeguard policy principles and specific \nrequirements that projects supported by the \nAsian Development Bank must comply with. \nThey cover\n\u2022 \n\nenvironmental and social impact \nassessment, planning, and management;\n\n\u2022  biodiversity and sustainable natural \n\nresources management; \n\n\u2022  prevention and abatement of pollution;\n\u2022 \n\noccupational and community health and \nsafety; \n\u2022 \ninvoluntary resettlement;1 \n\u2022 \nindigenous peoples;\n\u2022  physical cultural resources;\n\u2022 \n\ninformation disclosure, consultation, and  \nparticipation; and\ngrievance redress mechanisms, \nmonitoring, and reporting.\n\n\u2022 \n\n1 Defined as \u201csocial and economic impacts that are permanent \nor temporary and are caused by (1) acquisition of land and other \nfixed assets, (2) change in the use of land, or (3) restrictions \nimposed on land as a result of an ADB operation.\u201d ADB. 2006. \nOperations Manual.

Safeguard Policy Statement. http://www.adb.\norg/Documents/Policies/Safeguards/Safeguard-Policy-Statement-\nJune2009.pdf\n\nIt lays out policy principles and outlines a set \nof specific safeguard requirements that ADB-\nsupported projects are expected to meet when \naddressing social and environmental impacts \nand risks (Box 2.15). The SPS applies to all ADB-\nsupported projects, and stipulates compliance \nwith applicable safeguard requirements of our \nclient countries. \n\nIn 2010, the Asian Development Bank approved \n115 projects. Among them, 74 were deemed \nto have potential environmental impacts and \nthus required environmental assessment, \nincluding environmental management plans or \nframeworks; 49 were considered to have potential \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts and required \nresettlement plans and frameworks; and 19 were \ndeemed to have potential impacts on indigenous \n\npeoples, requiring the preparation of indigenous \npeoples plans and frameworks. Of projects \nincluding ADB investment that goes through or \nto a financial intermediary, 15 were required to \nhave environmental and social manage- \nment systems. \n\nTo ensure sound implementation of the SPS, \nwe provided ADB staff members with extensive \ntraining prior to and after the SPS became \neffective. Nearly 700 staff members from \nheadquarters and field offices have been trained. \nAt the same time, and in line with the SPS, ADB\u2019s \nWork Program and Budget Framework 2010\u2013\n2012 includes 38 new safeguard staff positions. \nTo enhance awareness about the safeguards \namong our stakeholders, we held workshops \nin Cambodia, the PRC, India, Indonesia, the Lao \n\nPart 2: The Environment, Social Development, and Governance      51\n\n\fPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Nepal, \nPakistan, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, and \nViet Nam.

The SPS has been \ntranslated into nine languages.\n\nclients, helps them meet the requirements during \nproject processing and implementation through \ncapacity development programs, ensures due \ndiligence and review, and provides monitoring \nand supervision. \n\nSafeguard review and due diligence \nprocedures. ADB\u2019s Operations Manual, Section \nF1 on Safeguard Review Procedures,81 outlines \nour due diligence, review, and supervision \nrequirements, to ensure that borrowers comply \nwith the applicable safeguard requirements. \nWe monitor compliance with the safeguard \nrequirements at the beginning of a project and \nthroughout the project cycle. \n\nOperations departments report to ADB\u2019s \nmanagement team on each project\u2019s status of \ncompliance with the safeguards. In addition, \nthe Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment advises ADB\u2019s management team \nand operations departments on safeguard \ncompliance, particularly for projects that could \nhave significant impacts pertaining to the \nsafeguards. If risks of noncompliance arise during \nproject preparation, action to ensure compliance \nis recommended and we take steps to ensure \nthat safeguard requirements are met before \nprojects are approved by our Board of Directors. \nOperations departments and the Regional and \nSustainable Development Department field \nteams to review safeguards for on-\ngoing projects\u2014particularly for projects that \ncould have significant impacts\u2014to ensure the \nSPS requirements are properly implemented. \nExecuting agencies and project sponsors are \nrequired to produce environmental or social \nsafeguard monitoring reports, and project \ncompletion and evaluation reports include a \nreview of the implementation of safeguards. \n\nRoles and responsibilities. We work with \nour borrowers to put policy principles and \nrequirements into practice. The borrower is \nresponsible for implementing the provisions of \nthe SPS. ADB explains the policy requirements to \n\nStrengthening country safeguard systems. \nThe SPS also emphasizes the need to assist our \nclient countries to strengthen and effectively \nimplement their own systems to help ensure \nenvironmental and social safeguards are \nemployed. We have provided technical \nassistance82 for several client countries to study \ntheir safeguard systems, recommend gap-\nfilling measures, incorporate international good \npractice into national laws and regulations, \nbuild institutional capacity, engage in public \nparticipation and enable transparency, and \nenhance financial intermediaries\u2019 awareness \nand know-how in establishing and maintaining \ncorporate environmental and social  \nresponsibility systems.\n\nGOVERNANCE AND ANTICORRUPTION\nFor over a decade, ADB has been working with \nclient countries and partners in civil society and \nthe private sector to promote good governance \nand to combat corruption. \n\nOur Second Governance and Anticorruption \nAction Plan (GACAP II), endorsed in mid-2006, \nplaces a focus on three thematic priorities: public \nfinancial management; public procurement; and \nthe combating of corruption through preventive, \nenforcement, and investigative measures. GACAP \nII\u2019s four objectives are to\n\u2022 \n\nimprove the identification and management \nof governance, institutional, and corruption \nrisks to our country programs;\nstrengthen the governance and \nanticorruption components of our projects;\n\u2022  better manage our portfolio of governance-\n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nrelated actions; and\nimprove our internal capacity for and access \nto external expertise.\n\n52      ADB Sustainability Report\n\n\fBox 2.16  Supporting Indonesia\u2019s efforts to improve governance\n\nThe Indonesian government has been working \nto enhance its governance.

A key feature of GACAP II is that it \nintroduces a risk-based approach to governance \nand corruption assessments. In the context of \nGACAP II, diagnostics focus on assessing the \nrisk to development outcomes posed by weak \ngovernance, poorly performing institutions, or \nvulnerability to corruption. Under GACAP II,  \ngovernance risk assessments (focusing on \npublic financial management, procurement, \nand vulnerability to corruption) are prepared \nat country, sector, and project levels.83 These \nassessments are supported by risk management \nplans that are used to document concrete action \nneeded to manage risks that are most likely to \nadversely impact development outcomes. \n\nWe have placed particular emphasis on \nidentifying and responding to governance \nchallenges and opportunities at the sector level. \n\nIn 2010, we prepared governance guidance \nnotes for urban water, education, roads, and \nelectricity. To ensure maximum operational \nrelevance, the guidance notes were prepared as \na joint effort between the Governance and Public \nManagement Community of Practice and the \nrelevant sector community of practice.\n\nSupporting regional and country efforts to \nimprove governance and reduce vulnerability \nto corruption. In 2009, about 26% of our \nloans were classified as governance projects. \nA significant part of this support is provided \nthrough sector programs, program-based \napproaches, and projects that involve cross-\ncutting policy and institutional reforms. In \nIndonesia, for example, governance was \nimproved by addressing public financial \nmanagement through a policy-based lending \noperation (Box 2.16). \n\nPart 2: The Environment, Social Development, and Governance      53\n\n\fRegional cooperation, partnerships, and \ncofinancing.

The NGOs \nare helping flood-prone villages in Southwest Tajikistan\u2019s Khatlon region to prepare and cope with \nfloods and other natural disasters. The NGO consortium mobilized several experts (including a \nhydrogeologist, botanist, zoologist, land management expert, and legal expert) to identify issues \nand possible solutions for restoring the damaged ecosystems and strengthening riverbank and \nhousing areas against floods.\n\nDeveloping a multistakeholder network to address climate change. We are working with \nclient countries in the Pacific to build regional capacities to face the challenges posed by climate \nchange impacts.2 Under a new project approved in 2009, ADB\u2019s Pacific Climate Change Program \nwill establish a network, coordination, and communication system for the Pacific Climate Change \nImplementation Plan,3 which will include national climate change focal points, development \npartners, research organizations, NGOs, civil society groups, and private sector stakeholders. The \nPacific Climate Change Program will conduct public education and outreach activities to improve \nthe understanding of climate change adaptation in government ministries, schools, the private \nsector, and civil society. \n\n1  ADB. 2008.

As part of the \naction plan to protect and preserve these resources, \nwe and the World Wide Fund for Nature are preparing \nto publicize them in a book showcasing the Coral \nTriangle\u2019s ecosystem and some of its species. \n\nADB and WWF have held annual consultations \nsince 2002 to review their activities, discuss \nnew areas of focus, and conduct joint \nprogramming. The partnership has mainly \nfocused on the management of some critical \necosystems in Asia and the Pacific through \nthree regional environmental initiatives\u2014the \nCoral Triangle Initiative, the Heart of Borneo \nInitiative, and the Greater Mekong Subregion \nBiodiversity Conservation Corridors Initiative. In October 2010, ADB and WWF organized several side \nevents at the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity held in Nagoya, \nJapan to highlight the importance of joint actions to sustain biodiversity and promote sustainable \ndevelopment in the region. Cooperation between the two organizations continues to expand in \ndeveloping approaches for conserving and managing forests, protecting coastal ecosystems, and \nimplementing ecosystem-based adaptation. \n\nThe following three examples demonstrate other ADB activities with international nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs).\n\u2022 \n\n  In partnership with SNV Netherlands Development Organisation, we are promoting a pilot biogas \n\nenergy development project to benefit rural farmers in Bhutan (Box 2.5).1 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n  ADB has consulted with Bhutan\u2019s Royal Society for Protection of Nature, a national NGO well \n\nknown for its work in environmental awareness, to inform project design and policy formation and \nguidelines for hydropower and water usage. \n\n  We have consulted WWF, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and the \n\nCentre for International Studies and Cooperation regarding Nepal\u2019s climate change adaptation \nprogram in order to support a new Climate Investment Fund Strategic Program for Climate \nResilience. NGOs will be involved in implementing a community-based vulnerability assessment \nand action planning initiative to respond to effects of climate change.\n\n1 See http://www.adb.org/Projects/project.asp?id=37399.\n\nPart 2: The Environment, Social Development, and Governance      55\n\n\fcapacity development aspects of the United \nNations Convention against Corruption. Other \ninternational networks in which ADB actively \nparticipates include the Governance Network, \nthe Task Force on Public Financial Management, \nthe Task Force on Tax and Development (all \nthree coordinated by the OECD Development \nAssistance Committee), and the Multilateral \nDevelopment Bank Financial Management \nHarmonization Working Group (see Part 1).\n\nWORKING WITH CIVIL SOCIETY\nWe continue to contribute to good governance \npractices by engaging with civil society \norganizations (CSOs) in project design and \nimplementation as well as in developing and \nreviewing our major policies. For example, in \n2010, hundreds of representatives of project-\naffected people, NGOs, and community-based \norganizations contributed to updating our Public \nCommunications Policy (Part 1). \n\nWe recognize CSOs as key actors in addressing \nthe governance and other challenges confronting \nthe Asia and Pacific region. CSOs are especially \nwell-situated to channel the inputs of poor and \nmarginalized communities into the design and \nformulation of development interventions. Civil \nsociety continued to contribute to the country \npartnership strategy development process \nthrough in-country consultations. For example, \nthe new country partnership strategy for Nepal84 \nidentifies engaging with civil society as one of six \nthematic priorities; and approximately two-thirds \nof our sovereign investment projects85 involve \nCSOs in some way\u2014many play an important \nrole in monitoring project implementation. Our \ncollaboration with CSOs thus comes in many \nforms (Boxes 2.17 and 2.18 on pp. 54 and 55 \nprovide examples).\n\n56      ADB Sustainability Report\n\n\fPart 3\nADB\u2019s\nCorporate \nFootprint\n\n\fADB\u2019s\nCorporate\nFootprint\n\nOur Staff and Offices\n\nADB\u2019s headquarters\n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) is based \nin Manila, Philippines, and has 30 field offices, \nincluding country and regional missions and \nrepresentative offices (see the map on pp. vi-vii). \nWe opened two additional field offices during \n2009\u20132010.\n\n58  \n\nAt the end of 2010, ADB\u2019s headquarters served \nmore than 2,200 staff members. In addition, over \n3,600 consultants and service providers were \nusually engaged in our Manila facilities. We have \nconsistently worked to ensure that our facilities \nand staff are models of good practice and \ncitizenry in the Manila community and at other \nsites where we have offices.\n\nOur head office facilities occupy 6.5 hectares \nin Ortigas Center, Mandaluyong City, Metro \nManila. The building complex, which uses over \n41% of the site\u2019s land area, comprises a nine-\nstorey office tower block linked to a two-storey \nspecial facilities block. The buildings provide \nabout 144,000 square meters of space and were \ndesigned to be energy efficient. A six-storey car \nparking building was nearing completion at the \nend of 2010. These facilities are managed by \nADB\u2019s Office of Administrative Services. Because \nwe need to provide additional office space for \nthe increased number of staff members, the \noffice tower block will be extended by about \none third, into part of the current car park. The \n\n\fThe respondents identified characteristics of \nwork at ADB that they appreciated (i.e., goals \nand objectives, physical work environment, \nemployment security, job satisfaction, and \nworking relationships), and priority areas for \nimprovement (i.e., stress, balance and workload, \nperformance evaluation, work organization \nand efficiency, salary and benefits, and career \ndevelopment). The survey results serve as vital \ninputs into prioritizing the ongoing human \nresources and people management reforms \ndriven by and aligned with the business strategy.\n\nComprehensive review of salaries and \nbenefits. The comprehensive review of salaries \nand benefits for international staff was completed \nin 2010. The review showed that, overall, ADB\u2019s \ncompensation package is competitive and no \nmajor immediate changes are needed. Our \nmidpoint salaries are generally competitive \nagainst global markets in Asia and the Pacific, \nEurope, and the United States, including \ncomparator international organizations. However, \nthe review also found that actual average salaries \nare about 8% below the average midpoint \nsalaries (which reflects market salary levels for \ncomparable jobs). \n\nnew car parking building will compensate for the \ndecrease in ground-level parking area.\n\nWorking Together\n\nORGANIZATIONAL TRANSFORMATION\nOur People Strategy and action plan. The \nrecommendations resulting from the review \nof our 2005\u20132007 human resources strategy \nincluded two critical starting points that are \nenabling ADB to fundamentally realign its \nhuman resources and people management \nwith its business strategy\u2014Our People \nStrategy86\u2014and the Human Resources Function \nStrategic Framework and Action Plan.87 Our \nPeople Strategy provides a blueprint for ADB \nto be the premier development institution in \nAsia and the Pacific based on three interrelated \ngoals: secure skilled and motivated people who \nare well managed and operate in an enabling \nenvironment. The Human Resources Function \nStrategic Framework and Action Plan defines \nthe actions ADB will take to translate Our People \nStrategy\u2019s three goals into practice (Figure 3.1).\n\nA new staff classification system was approved \nin 2010, placing staff into three categories: \ninternational, national, and administrative \n(previously, the category \u201clocal\u201d staff included the \nnational and administrative staff at headquarters). \nThe new system appropriately recognizes and \nacknowledges differences in roles, qualifications, \nand skills sets.88\n\nStaff engagement survey. To promote positive \norganizational change, ADB completed a staff \nengagement survey administered by external \nexperts to measure progress achieved since the \nprevious 2008 survey results. Over 87% of staff \nmembers participated in the survey taken in May \n2010, compared to more than 81% in 2008. The \noverall engagement rate increased from 60% in \n2008 to more than 68% in 2010, suggesting that \nADB is progressing in the right direction.\n\nNew parking building at ADB headquarters\n\nPart 3: ADB\u2019s Corporate Footprint      59\n\n\fFigure 3.1  Our People Strategy and action plan\n\nOur People\nStrategy\n\nGoal 1\nHigh caliber, motivated, client-\nresponsive sta\ufb00\n\nGoal 2\nInspiring leadership and e\ufb00ective \npeople management\n\nGoal 3\nEnabling workplace \nenvironment and culture\n\nHuman Resources Function Strategic Framework and Action Plan\n\nSkills mix alignment\n\nMerit and skills-based \nassignment\n\nCareer management\n\nContinuous sta\ufb00 \ndevelopment\n\nCompetitive remuneration\n\nKnowledge sharing\n\nPrioritization of people \nmanagement\n\nTeamwork and \nmultidisciplinary approaches\n\nAccountability\n\nPerformance management\n\nA supportive and client\u2013 \nresponsive human resources \nfunction\n\nTransparency in human \nresources action\n\nSupported by\n\nOne ADB\n\nDiversity and cohesiveness\n\nInclusive and ethical work \nenvironment\n\nSta\ufb00 safety and welfare\n\nE\ufb03cient work processes \nand procedures\n\nCommunication\n\nADB Management\n\nHeads of department \nand team directors\n\nBudget, Personnel, and \nManagement Systems \nDepartment\n\nInformation \ntechnology \ninfrastructure\n\nChange management\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank.\n\nThus, to improve the competitiveness of its \nsalaries, ADB aims to achieve full parity with the \nmarket by 2015. Several proposals are being \nconsidered to introduce cost-effective changes \nto benefits, primarily by reallocating budgetary \nresources, with the goal of giving staff options \nand more flexibility, reducing administrative costs \nfor ADB, and maintaining the sustainability of key \nbenefit programs. Details of the proposed benefit \nchanges will be finalized after consultations \n\nwith staff and retirees, which will start in early \n2011. A similar total remuneration study will be \nundertaken in 2011 to assess the appropriateness \nand competitiveness of the compensation \npackage for ADB\u2019s national and administrative \nstaff members in headquarters and field offices.\n\nChanges. During ADB\u2019s 45 years, our work and \nstaffing have continued to expand. Only one \noffice has been closed. Its regional staff were \n\n60      ADB Sustainability Report\n\n\freassigned to other ADB offices, and local staff \nmembers who could not be reassigned were \nprovided with a generous separation package, \nlong notice period, and career counseling during \nthe phasing down period.\n\nOUR DIVERSE STAFF\nDiversity in action. We promote diversity among \nour staff members in nationality and gender, \nage, religion, disability, and lifestyle. Our People \n\nStrategy\u2019s third goal, which is \u201ca supportive and \nenabling workplace environment and culture,\u201d \ncontains several principles to encourage diversity \nand an inclusive work environment. At the end \nof 2010, our 2,833 staff members came from \n59 of our 67 member countries.89 Because we \nare located in Manila, about 1,360 of our staff \nmembers are Philippine nationals.

The table also \nprovides data on staff turnover.90\n\nAs a result of active recruitment practices, the \nproportion of female professional staff increased \nfrom less than 11% in 1996 to 29.1% at the end of \n2010. Representation of women at senior levels \nreached an all-time high of 19.7% at the end \nof 2010, reflecting the progression of women \nthrough the levels in the organization. Our \ngender action program focuses on increasing \nthe representation and leadership by female \ninternational staff, fostering gender balance, \nand ensuring management accountability for \nimproving ADB\u2019s gender balance and providing \nan inclusive work environment.\n\nCode of conduct. ADB staff members are \nbound by and must be familiar with the code of \nconduct and are required to act appropriately as \ninternational civil servants.91\n\nProfessional development and performance. \nAll staff members are scheduled for formal \ndiscussions of their performance annually, and \nsupervisors are expected to provide their staff \nmembers with constructive feedback on an \nongoing basis. Each staff member\u2019s performance \nis rated yearly and salary increases are based on \nperformance.\n\nTo encourage frequent and meaningful \nlearning and development discussions \nbetween supervisors and their staff members, \ndevelopment planning discussions are held \nseparately from performance reviews.\n\nDepartmental work plans to support the \nimplementation of Strategy 2020 are cascaded \ndown through to the individual level of each \nstaff member\u2019s work plan. These work plans are \naligned with the departmental work plans and \nare a basis of performance evaluation. In 2010, \nwe updated the Staff Development Framework \n\nand identified and reorganized staff development \nprograms based on six key pillars:\n(1) \n\ninstilling an ADB-specific business model and \nprocedures;\n\n(2)  enhancing sector, thematic, regional, and \n\ncountry-specific focus;\n\n(3)  strengthening management and leadership \n\n(4)  fostering teamwork and communication;\n(5)  enhancing ADB values, principles, and \n\ncapabilities;\n\npolicies; and\n\n(6)  supporting good ADB work\u2013life balance.\n\nThe curriculum and programs were planned \nand designed through close consultation and \npartnership with managers, client departments, \nand communities of practice. To foster knowledge \nsharing across the organization, internal resource \npeople delivered an increased share of programs. \nGiven ADB\u2019s wide geographical and functional \ncoverage, we introduced a more decentralized \nplanning and management of staff development \nresources and program delivery. The participation \nof field office staff in training at the headquarters \nincreased, while training also continued at the \nfield offices.\n\nAverage recorded hours of staff training per \nperson have decreased from mid-2009 on \nbecause they exclude some programs formerly \nrun and recorded by the training group. Data in \nTable 3.2 exclude programs for which attendance \nis not recorded by our training and information \ntechnology groups, such as briefings, learning \n\nTable 3.2  Hours of training per person\n\nStaff Category\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\nInternational\n\nNational\n\nAll staff\n\n27.5\n\n28.9\n\n28.4\n\n27.0\n\n25.5\n\n26.0\n\n28.7\n\n24.8\n\n26.2\n\n\u201cInternational\u201d includes the category \u201cprofessional staff,\u201d which \nwas changed to \u201cInternational staff\u201d in 2010, and \u201cNational\u201d \nincludes \u201cNational officers\u201d and \u201cAdministrative staff.\u201d  Training \nfor information technology is included here, but was not \navailable for the previous two sustainability reports.\n\n62      ADB Sustainability Report\n\n\fsessions by communities of practice, and self-\nstudy and online learning. In addition, the length \nof some programs has been decreased. Given the \nnature of our organization and the qualifications \nfor people to be hired, each employee is expected \nto be versed in human rights prior to joining ADB, \nand human rights is a theme that permeates \nmuch of our development training, including that \non safeguards and social dimensions.\n\nWork\u2013life balance. ADB recognizes the need to \nenhance workplace practices to promote work\u2013\nlife balance among its staff members. Thus, ADB \nstrives to achieve greater productivity and staff \neffectiveness through enhanced flextime, leave, \nwork-from-home arrangements, and maternity \nleave; dedicated private space for women staff \nmembers to express breast milk for their infants; \nenhanced discretionary time off for holidays \nmissed and spent at work and for prolonged \nwork periods; increased flexibility in work hours; \nand increased rest time to address the physical \nfatigue caused by lengthy business travel.\n\nLifelong learning and skills. We offer numerous \nprograms for lifelong learning and skills \nmanagement, including communication and \npresentation skills, working in a multicultural \nenvironment, briefings on health-related matters, \nand retirement planning. Additional programs to \nsupport staff skills and well-being are currently \nbeing designed for delivery in 2011.\n\nRECRUITMENT, SALARIES, AND BENEFITS\nRecruitment and salaries.92  We recruit our staff \nfrom among nationals of our member countries. \nAt senior levels, most positions are filled through \ninternal promotion. We do not have part-time \npositions.\n\nADB offers a comprehensive compensation \npackage that is competitive in the \ninternational market and comparable to that \nof similar multilateral institutions. National and \nadministrative staff members are provided a \n\nAnticorruption training session\n\ncomprehensive compensation package that is \nlocally competitive for locally hired staff members \nwho are nationals of the country in which they \nare based. ADB\u2019s compensation system is market \ndriven and is based on an annual salary survey \nof local comparators. Starting salaries for new \nstaff members are determined on the basis of \nthe accountabilities and responsibilities of the \nposition and comparability with other staff \nmembers in service who have equivalent or \nsimilar qualifications and experience. \n\nBenefits.93  All staff members are provided with \nworldwide medical insurance for themselves and \ndependents, life and disability insurance, and a \ndefined benefit plan providing for lump-sum or \nannuity payments on retirement. Life, disability, \nand travel insurance plans are also available to \ndependents. Starting in 2009, we also provided \nqualifying staff and retirees with access to long-\nterm care insurance, to help provide for the cost \nof care when an individual is unable to perform \nbasic activities of daily living.\n\nHealth services. To promote the health and \nwell-being of staff members, the headquarters \nin Manila has a medical clinic offering extensive \n\nPart 3: ADB\u2019s Corporate Footprint      63\n\n\femergencies when away from the duty station, \nwe are covered by a medical evacuation program \noperated by an external medical assistance \nprovider. \n\nLeave. Annual leave is granted for a minimum \nof 26 days, depending on the duration of \nemployment. For the international staff, home \ncountry travel is provided so they and their \ndependents may visit their home countries \nannually to maintain association with their own \ncultures. Sick leave and some other forms of leave \nare granted as needed. We provide several leave \noptions in support of dependents; birth-related \nneeds such as maternity and extended maternity \nleave, paternity leave, and adoption leave; and \nemergency leave to attend the funeral of an \nimmediate family member.94\n\nPension. Our defined benefit pension plan \nprovides qualifying staff members with \na withdrawal lump-sum payment and/or \nan annuity on retirement. We also have a \n\u201cdiscretionary benefits\u201d plan that allows staff \nmembers to increase their pension annuity or \nwithdrawal amount.95\n\nSTAFF REPRESENTATION\nAs provided in the ADB Staff Association\u2019s \nConstitution, on joining ADB, staff members \nautomatically become members of the Staff \nAssociation and remain so unless they opt out. \nThe Staff Association\u2019s primary goals are to \nfoster a sense of purpose among members in \npromoting the aims and objectives of ADB and to \npromote and safeguard the rights, interests, and \nwelfare of members. \n\nThe Staff Council, comprising 12 members, 2 \nof which are elected from the international, \nnational, and administrative staff in resident \nmissions and regional offices, is the executive arm \nof the Staff Association. The Staff Council serves \nas a channel of communication between staff and \nADB\u2019s Management and holds monthly meetings \nas a group and with the Budget, Personnel, and \n\nUltraviolet light therapy at the physical therapy clinic at \nADB headquarters\n\ndiagnostic and treatment facilities free of charge \nto staff members, and arrangements with outside \nproviders for basic services to staff and their \ndependents, paid for by ADB. Annual physical \nexaminations for staff and dependents are free. \nAn in-house physiotherapy center provides staff \nmembers with free treatment and ergonomic \nevaluation of their workstation. We provide staff \nand dependents with monthly presentations on \nhealth topics. We have a 24/7 medical emergency \nassistance program for staff and dependents \nliving in Metro Manila through a corporate \ncontract with a \u201c911-like\u201d ambulance company. \nThe headquarters also has an in-house pharmacy \nfor the convenience of staff, dependents, and \nretirees. In 2010, we held our first Annual Health \nCare Fair for Manila-based staff, dependents, and \nretirees to interact with the international health \ninsurance provider and with local health care \nservice organizations.\n\nStaff members traveling on business are \nequipped with a medical kit with basic needs \nand malaria prophylaxis.

This \nis linked to priority themes of transparency, \naccountability, equity, a level playing field, and \nchecks and balances. The Staff Council adopted \na results-based reform agenda and amended the \nStaff Association Constitution to address good \ngovernance. \n\nThe Staff Council applied an evidence-based \nand solutions-oriented approach in handling \nstaff issues, including, for example, benefits \nadministration, career development, and \nperformance management. Proposals for solving \nsuch issues were developed through extensive \nstaff consultations, periodic surveys, and data \nfrom comparator organizations. The Staff Council \npresented the proposals for consideration by \nBPMSD. The Director Competency Recognition \nProgram aims to identify managers who \nexemplify the criteria based on ADB\u2019s core \ncompetencies for supervisors.\n\nIn 2009, ADB hosted the meeting of staff \nassociations of international finance institutions. \nThe meeting focused on management\u2013staff \nrelations. In 2010, the Staff Council chairperson \nrepresented ADB\u2019s staff at the same meeting, held \nin London and convened by the European Bank \n\nfor Reconstruction and Development, where \n\u201cPromoting Good Management\u201d was a central \ntheme.\n\nTHE GRIEVANCE PROCESS\nBecause ADB is an international organization, \nit does not fall under the jurisdiction of \nemployment tribunals and national courts in \nits member countries. Our grievance process \nfor resolving staff members\u2019 issues about the \nterms and conditions of their employment has \nthree stages: (1) conciliation and administrative \nreview, (2) appeals, and (3) the Administrative \nTribunal. If a settlement is not reached during \nconciliation, staff members may proceed to \nadministrative review and then to the appeals \nstage. The Appeals Committee provides a venue \nfor the staff member to obtain a peer review of \nthe grievance and makes a recommendation \nto ADB\u2019s President. Final recourse is to the ADB \nAdministrative Tribunal, an independent body \nthat reviews administrative decisions about \nstaff member grievances. Decisions of the \nAdministrative Tribunal are publicly available \non the internet.96 By the end of 2010, ADB was \nseriously considering instituting an ombuds \nfunction.\n\nAny incidents involving discrimination or \nharassment are dealt with by the human \nresources division or through the grievance \nprocess, and are handled confidentially. Group \nissues are discussed by the Staff Council directly \nwith the head of BPMSD. The Administrative \nTribunal recently upheld ADB\u2019s right to dismiss \nstaff members guilty of harassment.\n\nManaging Our \nEnvironmental Footprint\n\nPart of ADB\u2019s commitment to minimize our \nenvironmental footprint is maintaining our \nheadquarters facility as a \u201cgreen building.\u201d  The \n\nThe Sta\ufb00 Council with ADB President Kuroda\n\nPart 3: ADB\u2019s Corporate Footprint      65\n\n\fOur environmental protection investments \ninclude the rainwater harvest and treated \nwastewater facilities.\n\nMost of the building materials for our \nheadquarters are now procured locally. For other \ninstitutional procurement, we strive to have at \nleast 30% of the content local, depending on \navailability. \n\nISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001. Our Environment, \nHealth, and Safety Management System (EHSMS) \nwas originally certified in 2003 under the \nInternational Organization for Standardization \n(ISO) 1400197 and Occupational Health and \nSafety Assessment Series (OHSAS) 18001.98 We \nwere recertified in 2006 and 2009. Our resource \nconservation plan comprises part of ISO 14001 \ncertification. Our EHSMS policy specifically \ntargets our headquarters building, to ensure \nit complies with internationally recognized \nmanagement system standards. The policy \nstates that ADB will (1) comply with legal and \nother requirements applicable to its buildings \nand facilities; (2) employ best practices and safe \noperating procedures to prevent the release of \npollutants; (3) optimize the use of resources; \nreduce waste generation; and reuse, recycle, and \ntreat and dispose of all wastes properly; (4) strive \nto eliminate health and safety risks to employees, \nbusiness partners, and the surrounding \ncommunity; and (5) enhance environmental, \nhealth, and safety awareness at all levels of the \norganization.99\n\nADB owns the buildings in which two of our \nfield offices are located: in Bangladesh and India. \nThe India Resident Mission is certified under \nISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001. Currently we are \nworking with our Bangladesh Resident Mission \nfor similar certification. The other field offices \nare in leased spaces for which we are gathering \ndata on resource use, and then we will develop \na program for certification. None of ADB\u2019s offices \nare near or affect protected areas.\n\nSolar panels on the roof of the new car parking building at \nADB headquarters\n\nbuilding is designed for low heat absorption, \nincluding air space between the granite slabs \non the exterior, to dissipate heat; heavy duty \naluminum window grills to diffuse light; and \nshatter-resistant film windows, to provide \nprotection and filter out 99% of ultraviolet \nrays. Windows along hallways and the inner \natrium bring in light, thus lowering lighting \nrequirements.  \n\nOur expenditures for environmental protection \ninclude \n\u2022 \n\noperating and maintaining the sewage \ntreatment plant;\ntesting water quality, wastewater quality, \nindoor air quality, and air emissions from the \nstandby generators;\n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  providing external surveillance audit \nand technical services to sustain the \nenvironmental health and safety \nmanagement system; and\n\n\u2022  managing our waste (collection, disposal, \n\ntreatment, sorting, and storage) and securing \nenvironmental permits.\n\n66      ADB Sustainability Report\n\n\f(such as Energy Star, for computers, electronics, \nand electrical products; Green Seal for cleaning \nmaterials; and the Forest Stewardship Council, \nfor paper products).101 These products are \nprepared using sustainable processes; are more \n\u201cenvironmentally friendly\u201d and less polluting than \nother similar products; contain post-consumer \nmaterials; or contain less hazardous substances \nthan products not so labeled. Some of the \nproducts may have been tagged \u201cgreen\u201d in the \ncontext of disposal for recycling (such as toners \nand ink cartridges). During 2010, about 50% \nof consumables at the ADB headquarters were \nenvironmentally friendly.\n\nWe work closely with moving companies to \nensure they use reused or recycled packing \nmaterials for shipments of official materials and \nthe goods of ADB staff members. Cartons and \ncrates are returned to suppliers that reuse them, \nreducing solid waste generated in ADB.\n\nAccident and occupational illness rate. ADB\u2019s \nOccupational Health and Safety Committee\u2019s \nmandate is to \u201cstrive to eliminate health and \nsafety risks to ADB staff, business partners, and \nsurrounding communities by using appropriate \ntechnologies, by developing disaster response \nand recovery plans for its building operations \nand facilities, and by being constantly prepared \nfor emergencies.\u201d  This is based on OHSAS \n18001 guidelines.100  The committee\u2019s findings \nare reviewed twice yearly by a high-level \nmanagement team. The review forms part of the \nEHSMS requirement (under ISO 14001 and OHSAS \n18001). All staff members and service providers \nare represented on the Joint Worker Health and \nSafety Committee.\n\nWe compile statistics on the number of calls for \nhelp inside the headquarters (Table 3.3), but \nthese are not broken down by the reason for \nthe call (e.g., illness, work-related accident, not \nwork-related accident). ADB has had no major \ncontroversies, fines, or settlements relating to \nhealth and safety.\n\nTable 3.3  Accident and assistance \nstatistics at headquarters\n\nVehicular \naccident \nwithin \nheadquarters \nproperty\n\nAmbulance \ntransport \nassistance\n\nFirst aid \nassistance\n\n2\n\n11\n\n48\n\n59\n\n131\n\n94\n\nYear\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\nGreen procurement.

In future we hope to be able to \nprovide factors that will include visitors and the actual average days that staff, consultants, and service providers spend at the headquarters \nbuilding, but such data are currently not available. Scope 2 emissions are overstated, as the electricity provider notes that 68% of the \ngeneration it supplies is clean energy and 17.5% is renewable energy, which is not factored in above. We assume for the calculations that our \nelectricity is 100% from fossil fuel because we use the World Resources Institute calculation tool based on the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change guidelines. This may change when the Philippines issues new implementing rules and regulations that consider combining \nsources of electricity. \n\nGreening our headquarters. Our well-\nlandscaped gardens and lawns provide a pleasant \ncampus for work and a modest carbon sink for \ngreenhouse gases (GHGs). Native and adapted \nplants enhance the grounds and lawns. Greening \nactivities have included the main entrance \nfountain area and the facilities block and office \ntower roof decks, and are planned for the new car \nparking building. \n\nConserving resources. ADB\u2019s resource \nconservation programs are governed by the 3Rs \nprinciple (reduce, reuse, and recycle) and are \nimplemented by staff members, consultants, and \nservice providers. Table 3.4 indicates our use of \nelectricity and water and our emissions of GHGs \nduring 2005\u20132010, as a total and per person \nat headquarters. In 2009, we started an ADB-\nwide campaign for resource conservation using \n\nelectronic messages that appear each time a staff \nmember\u2019s computer is turned on. The campaign \nfocuses on reducing solid waste and conserving \nelectricity, water, and paper.\n\nEnergy. The Energy Conservation Team \nmonitors ADB\u2019s consumption of electricity and \nformulates conservation strategies. Our electricity \nconsumption remained almost unchanged from \n2006 to 2007 because we installed four additional \nair handling units to improve the air quality in \nthe building, then declined by 2% in 2008 as \nconservation and efficiency measures had their \nimpact. Our electricity consumption rose 2% in \n2009 and 3.5% in 2010 because we expanded \nour staff and increased the number of people \nworking at the headquarters building and events \nheld, and increased \u201cair purging\u201d in response \nto threats of pandemics (e.g., avian influenza). \n\n68      ADB Sustainability Report\n\n\fMeralco, our electricity supplier, reported that \nin 2009, 68% of the energy provided to its \nconsumers was clean energy and 17.5% was \nrenewable energy.102\n\nRecent initiatives to reduce electricity \nconsumption include using light emitting diodes \n(LED) in several areas, including the new car \nparking building. Solar panels have been added \nto provide electricity for the lagoon in the west \nparking area, the central courtyard, and the new \ncar parking building. We plan to measure the \nresulting energy saving in future.\n\nAt headquarters, we use small quantities of diesel \nto power standby generators used only during \npower outages and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) \nto heat water for showers and for preparing food.\n\nIn March 2009, as a commitment to \u201cGreen \nBuilding\u201d initiatives, we opted to seek Leadership \nin Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) \ncertification through the United States Green \nBuilding Council. LEED is an internationally \nrecognized system for certifying green buildings. \nOur application for LEED certification for existing \nbuilding operation and maintenance was \nregistered in May 2010. LEED certification focuses \non sustainable sites, energy and atmosphere, \nwater efficiency, indoor environmental quality, \nand materials and resources. The data for the \nEHSMS were used as input for LEED certification.\n\nTable 3.5  Water use at ADB headquarters \n(cubic meters)\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\nVolume\n\nVolume\n\n% of \nTotal\n\n% of \nTotal\n\nPotable    \nwater\n\nRecycled \nwater\n\nRainwater\n\n138,602.00\n\n95.86\n\n151,826.00\n\n94.39\n\n5,409.83\n\n579.80\n\n3.74\n\n0.40\n\n7,312.23\n\n1,704.00\n\n4.55\n\n1.06\n\nTotal\n\n144,591.63\n\n160,842.23\n\nDemonstrating the new rainwater harvesting system to \nVice-President Bindu N.

During 2009\u20132010, our water \nconsumption increased by 10% (Table 3.5) due \nto the increased number of staff and consultants. \nHowever, by using treated water from the \nsewage treatment plant and harvested rainwater \nfor cleaning the grounds and fa\u00e7ade and for \nwatering the plants, we reduced our use of \npotable water by almost 0.7%. ADB purchases \nits water from Manila Water, which is supplied \nby dams in two watersheds: Ipo and Angat, both \nin Bulacan Province. Manila Water was the first \nPhilippine corporation to issue a sustainability \nreport following Global Reporting Initiative \nguidelines.103 The volume of water we use is \ninsufficient to have a significant impact on the \nreceiving body, Manila Bay.\n\nPaper and printing. The Paper Conservation \nCommittee inspects paper use in all units in ADB \nquarterly. Staff recycle used paper by placing it \nin marked bins. At headquarters, we use 100% \nrecycled paper with Forest Stewardship Council \ncertification, manufactured using Certified \nRenewable Energy (Green-e). All our publications \nare printed using vegetable-oil based ink. An \nincreasing number of the documents provided to \nour Board of Directors are only sent electronically \n\nPart 3: ADB\u2019s Corporate Footprint      69\n\n\fto conserve on paper use.

In 2008, we initiated \na scheme to capture GHGs from operational \nactivities and convert them to carbon dioxide \nusing guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel \non Climate Change. Table 3.6 presents data on \nScope 1 GHGs from direct emission sources\u2014\npower generators, stoves and heaters powered \nby LPG, our official vehicles, and the refrigeration \nsystem. Trends in GHG emissions from indirect \nsources, such as electricity, decreased during \n2005\u20132008 and increased in 2009\u20132010. The \nincrease is in proportion to the use of electricity \nand is attributed to the increased use of the \nbuilding. \n\nMeasures to continue reducing our GHG \nemissions are ongoing. We carefully monitor \nthe emissions levels of our vehicle fleet and \nconsider these and fuel efficiency ratings when \nprocuring new vehicles. To reduce direct carbon \ndioxide emissions in Metro Manila and improve \nthe fuel efficiency of our official vehicle fleet, we \nintroduced three hybrid cars and will purchase \nanother in 2011. To reduce transport associated \nwith mail, we now have one post office box \n(previously we had two, in widely spread \nlocations).\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2007\nYear\n\nCumulative solid waste generation\n\nTrend\n\nWe use fire-suppression, refrigeration, and air-\nconditioning systems at headquarters that are \nfully compliant with the Montreal Protocol. \n\n70      ADB Sustainability Report\n\n\fTable 3.6  Greenhouse gas emissions: ADB headquarters\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\nCO2eq Emissions, t\n\nPower generator\n\n57.14\n\n160.87\n\n83.66\n\n31.84\n\n94.16\n\n98.39\n\n227.40\n\n129.27\n\n16.55\n\n230.25\n\n171.70\n\n35.30\n\n227.93\n\n203.54\n\n29.77\n\n223.71\n\n173.68\n\n37.71\n\n224.15\n\n153.57\n\n13.33\n\n298.00\n\n150.20\n\n18.04\n\nTotal direct emissions\n\n430.46\n\n598.12\n\n544.90\n\n466.94\n\n485.21\n\n564.63\n\nTotal Scope 1 + 2\n\n10,064.33 10,206.99 10,154.90\n\n9,965.97 10,220.98 10,704.82\n\n9,633.87\n\n9,608.87\n\n9,610.00\n\n9,499.03\n\n9,735.77 10,140.19\n\nRented vehicles\n\n60.6\n\n16.3\n\n7.40\n\n6.70\n\n8.45\n\n9.52\n\nCategory and Type of \nEmissions\n\nScope 1: Direct emissions\n\nLPG-fired cook stoves and \n\nheaters\n\nOfficial vehicles\n\nRefrigeration system\n\nScope 2: Indirect emissions \n(electricity)\n\nScope 3: Indirect emissions\n\nBusiness travel arranged by \n\nADB (Air)\n\nBusiness travel arranged by \n\nADB (Hotel)\n\nTransport of waste for \n\ndisposal\n\nCO2eq methane emission of \nbiodegradable waste\n\n(Methane emissions of \n\nbiodegradable waste in \nlandfill, t)\n\nPostage and freight\n\nShipment of goods\n\n5,713.09\n\n4,857.17\n\n4,948.00\n\n5,339.87\n\n5,967.60\n\n7,606.73\n\n635.82\n\n559.71\n\n554.29\n\n594.63\n\n510.58\n\n625.32\n\n4.2\n\n3.6\n\n2.82\n\n2.53\n\n1.83\n\n1.32\n\n503.25\n\n227.1\n\n209.62\n\n59.91\n\n54.93\n\n112.8\n\n(23.96)\n\n231.00\n\n414.66\n\n(10.81)\n\n187.76\n\n406.41\n\n(9.98)\n\n168.64\n\n222.17\n\n(2.86)\n\n225.36\n\n172.52\n\n(2.61)\n\n118.57\n\n198.68\n\n(5.37)\n\n113.42\n\n202.74\n\nTotal Scope 3\n\n7,562.62\n\n6,258.05\n\n6,112.94\n\n6,401.51\n\n6,860.64\n\n8,671.85\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, CO2 = carbon dioxide, CO2eq = carbon dioxide equivalent, LPG = liquified petroleum gas, t = ton.\nNote: \u201cTravel\u201d includes air transport and hotels, and is highly dependent on the location of ADB's annual meeting. \n\nIn addition, we encourage our staff members to\n\u2022 \n\nreduce air travel by using videoconferencing \n(we have now have 32 rooms equipped with \nvideoconferencing\u2014double the number \nreported in 2009\u2014and 12 large venues \nwhere such facilities may be set up on \nrequest); \ncombine official travel for multiple trips to \nminimize overall distance traveled; and\ntake the most direct route in air travel.\n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nThe use of videoconferencing has increased \nsignificantly\u2014the number of sessions has risen \nby 49% since 2008, and the number of hours has \nincreased by 54% (Table 3.7).\n\nGiven the nature of ADB\u2019s business, reducing \nair travel remains a challenge, especially as we \nhave expanded operations in Central Asia.

The Occupational Health \nand Safety Committee monitors indoor air quality \nwithin the headquarters. With the outside air \nsupply system moved to the upper level of the \noffice tower block, our staff is assured of indoor \nair quality compliant with standards of the United \nStates Environmental Protection Agency and the \nAmerican Society for Heating, Refrigeration, and \nAir-Conditioning Engineers. As noted earlier, we \nincreased the frequency of purging air from the \nbuilding and replacing it from once a week to \nthree times.\n\nEnsuring the security of our staff. ADB \npersonnel live and work in a region prone to \nnatural disasters. And some locations in which \nthey work present challenges of terrorism risks, \ncrime, and political and social instability. The \nincreased staffing and operations called for in \nStrategy 2020 are heightening the demands on \nour security, safety, and disaster management \nresources. We continue to seek appropriate and \nsustainable methods to meet the \u201cduty to care\u201d \ntoward our personnel through our own initiatives \n\nand in association with the United Nations \nSecurity Management Team. \n\nADB\u2019s security personnel are contractors who \nare appropriately trained for their job, which \nprimarily involves contact with people who go to \nthe headquarters building. They do not operate \nin the public domain, except for a small unit \nthat, in cooperation with the national police, \nprotects our President and his dependents; and \na few guards at pedestrian crossings adjacent \nto our headquarters. All our security procedures \nare guided by our internal procedures and local \npublic safety legislation. Public demonstrations \noutside our offices are managed by the local \npolice, not by our security personnel. \n\nAsset and business continuity. Our crisis \nmanagement structure supports the continuity of \nour critical business processes. To assure proper \nrisk mitigation (and support maintenance of \nour AAA financial rating), we recently engaged \nexperts to reassess threats that could adversely \nimpact our operations, and their study led to \nformulation of action needed. The ADB Business \nContinuity Core Group maintains and improves, \nwithin and outside the Philippines, facilities \nto store and rapidly retrieve critical data and \ninformation pertaining to our core business \nand finance. We use environmentally friendly \nequipment and supplies for the backup facilities.\n\nOur Community\n\nADB, its staff members, and their families \ncontinue to be active in the communities \nsurrounding our headquarters by financially \nsupporting charities with proven track records, \nthrough volunteer work, and by donating \nneeded goods to disadvantaged people and the \norganizations assisting them. These activities \nare accomplished primarily through the Staff \nCommunity Fund (SCF), which raises money \n\n72      ADB Sustainability Report\n\n\fthrough an annual \u201cShow\u201d that serves as the \nfocus for raising donations from staff members; \nADB\u2019s Spouses Association; and our institutional \ndonation program. \n\nThe guidelines for the institutional donation \nprogram, which were revised in 2009, place top \npriority on recipients including schools and \nacademic and training institutions, consonant \nwith Strategy 2020\u2019s emphasis on education \nand capacity building. One of the highlights \nof the donation activities was the turnover of \n100 used computers to public schools in Metro \nManila identified by the Philippine Department \nof Education. Also in 2010, we established a \npartnership with St. Francis Charity Clinic. The \nclinic serves indigent families in Mandaluyong \nand Pasig, where our headquarters is located. \nThrough the clinic we sponsor free medical \ntreatment and consultations 1 day each week. We \ndonated an ultrasound machine to the clinic. Staff \nmembers have participated in building homes \nfor the poor with Gawad Kalinga Foundation and \nhave provided supplies and Christmas packages \nfor poor children.\n\nThe SCF raises much of its funding from staff \nby focusing efforts around the annual \u201cShow\u201d \nheld in ADB. The Show features performances \nby staff members and SCF beneficiaries, and is \nlaunched by ADB\u2019s President. The proceeds from \nthe show and from contributions throughout the \nyear support numerous charities. In 2009, the \nSCF raised over P7.9 million (about $173,000) in \ndonations from staff and retirees. \n\nIn 2009, the SCF approved P5.8 million (about \n$135,000) in grants to 23 charities. Disbursals \nexceeded P7.1 million (about $165,000), including \namounts committed during 2008 but disbursed \nin 2009. In 2010, the SCF raised P6.7 million \n(about $156,000) and disbursed P4.4 million \n(about $102,000). Examples of assistance include \n\u2022  meals for students and children from poor \n\nfamilies;  \n\nMrs. Kumiko Kuroda (wife of ADB\u2019s President) \ndonated on behalf of ADB an ultrasound machine \nto St. Francis Charity Clinic. The clinic is near the \nheadquarters. \n\n\u2022 \n\nsupport for sexually abused girls and for \nsexually, emotionally, and/or physically \nabused children without access to legal \nservices; and\n\u2022 \na skills enhancement program for children.\nIn 2010, the SCF also ran a drive to provide over \n250 pairs of footwear for children who walk \nbarefoot on Smokey Mountain, a massive refuse \ndump where many families live and work. The \nSCF supported 20 organizations, approving \nfunding of P4.4 million (about $100,000).\n\nThe SCF and the Association of Former Employees \nof the Asian Development Bank also raised \nmoney for donations to poor victims of Typhoon \nOndoy, which caused extensive and prolonged \nflooding in Metro Manila in 2009. \n\nThe ADB Spouses Association also supports \nsocial welfare organizations (including centers \nfor development of poor children, orphanages, \na foster care center, and microfinance for \nlivelihood) and provides scholarships to needy \ndeserving students. During 2009\u20132010, the ADB \n\nPart 3: ADB\u2019s Corporate Footprint      73\n\n\fSpouses Association donated P1,050,500 (over \n$24,000) to social welfare organizations and \nprovided P492,000 (over $11,000) to support \nscholarships. \n\nIn 2008, the SCF and ADB Spouses Association \ncombined their efforts to support scholarships \nand education institutions. Together they \nsupported 75 scholarships in 2009 and 70  \nin 2010.\n\nThis collage of images includes bene\ufb01ciaries of activities and programs supported by the Sta\ufb00 Community \nFund and the ADB Spouses Association, and two Sta\ufb00 Community Fund representatives.\n\n74      ADB Sustainability Report\n\n\fEndnotes\n\nPart 1:  ADB\u2014Strategy and Structure\n1    http://www.adb.org/Financial-Management\n2    http://www.adb.org/bond-investors/cf-risk-\n\n3 \n4 \n\n5 \n6 \n7 \n\nmanagement.asp\nhttp://www.adb.org/About\nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/Manuals/\nOperations/default.asp?p=policies\nhttp://www.adb.org/About/membership.asp \nhttp://www.adb.org/gov\nThe Agreement Establishing the Asian \nDevelopment Bank. 1996.

For comparability, ADB\u2019s \ncurrent Sustainability Report is structured similarly to its first two. All three reports respond \nto the latest guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative while adapting to the particular \ncharacteristics of ADB\u2019s work and the many different audiences interested in the information \npresented. For information and comments, please e-mail njahmad@adb.org.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the \nregion\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: 1.8 billion people \nwho live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less than $1.25 a day.
