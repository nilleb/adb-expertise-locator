For comparability, ADB\u2019s \ncurrent Sustainability Report is structured similarly to its first two. All three reports respond \nto the latest guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative while adapting to the particular \ncharacteristics of ADB\u2019s work and the many different audiences interested in the information \npresented. For information and comments, please e-mail njahmad@adb.org.\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the \nregion\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: 1.8 billion people \nwho live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less than $1.25 a day. ADB is \ncommitted to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally \nsustainable growth, and regional integration.\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\nISBN 978-92-9092-321-3\nPublication Stock No. RPS113043\n \nPrinted on recycled paper Printed in the Philippines"], "metadata": {"Author": "Asian Development Bank", "CreationDate": "D:20110729104506+08'00'", "Creator": "Adobe InDesign CS3 (5.0.4)", "Keywords": "sustainability report, adb sustainability report, adb's corporate footprint, how adb works, environment, social development, governance ", "ModDate": "D:20110729110859+08'00'", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 9.0.0 (Windows)", "Subject": "The third Sustainability Report of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) offers easily accessible information on ADB\u2019s policies, programs, and practices as they relate to the social and environmental sustainability of development in Asia and the Pacific, and on changes in this work that have occurred since ADB published its second Sustainability Report, in 2009.", "Title": "Asian Development Bank Sustainability Report 2011", "Trapped": "False"}}
