This paper elaborates on a simple framework for \nregional corridors development in the context of regional cooperation, anchored \non two dimensions of these corridors: the extent to which they are national or \nregional and the area of their utilization. The framework is subsequently applied \nto the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) regional cooperation program, yielding \nseveral implications for its future.

Introduction\nRegional corridors are an important part of the toolkit for regional cooperation initiatives. \nSeveral corridors are promoted under regional cooperation initiatives in sub-Saharan \nAfrica, such as the Common Market for East and Southern Africa and South African \nDevelopment Committee.1 In the Asia and Pacific region, regional corridors are frequently \npromoted by regional cooperation initiatives supported by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), which is active in strengthening regional cooperation across the region. The \nGreater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Economic Cooperation Program, and the Central \nAsia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program, both supported by ADB, have \nidentified several regional corridors. Other initiatives based primarily along maritime areas \nhave also adopted regional corridors to promote their cooperation, such as the Indonesia, \nMalaysia, Thailand Growth Triangle.\nWhile regional cooperation initiatives have clearly recognized development of regional \ncorridors as central to enhancing their effectiveness and impact, the discussion of corridor \ndevelopment is often characterized by fairly general formulations that are frequently \ndifficult to pin down in terms of content or implications. Starting from the unequivocal \npremise that these corridors encompass improved transport infrastructure and connectivity \nacross the countries in the region, the regional corridors are then linked in general terms \nto increased trade and regional development. In the process, the corridors are expected \nto evolve into various stages through improvements in trade facilitation and provision \nof logistical services, but this transformative process is not informed by any explicit \nframework. The absence of a coherent framework is further intensified by the fact that \nregional corridor development intrinsically encompasses a broad spectrum of activities \nand stakeholders.\nFor instance, one approach to development of regional corridors envisages them as \ntransforming through five stages, namely, Stage 1: Transport Corridor, Stage 2: Transport \nand Trade Facilitation Corridor, Stage 3: Logistics Corridor, Stage 4: Urban Development \nCorridor, and Stage 5: Economic Corridor. This taxonomy is a useful initial step but needs \nto be further developed. The differences between stages 2\u20135 is not clear-cut, in part \nbecause the stages in themselves are not all well defined. Further, although some overlap \nbetween the stages is envisioned, there is a clear sequencing imposed across the stages \n1  Examples include the Northern Corridor linking landlocked countries of East and Central Africa, namely: Burundi, \nDemocratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, and Uganda to the sea port of Mombasa in Kenya; the Walvis Bay Corridor \nlinking the Port of Walvis Bay in South Africa to three neighboring countries of Angola, Botswana, and Namibia; \nand the Maputo Corridor between Mozambique and South Africa.  See Adzibgey et al. (2007).", "2 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 258\nthat is quite similar to the structural linearity of Rostovian \u201cstages of growth\u201d and may thus \nneed further analysis.2 The taxonomy also does not easily answer how the transition will \ntake place across the various sequenced stages. Will the drivers be public investment, \nor will private investment lead the way? Will it be driven by foreign direct investments \nand trade? Is there room for small and medium enterprise (SME) development or will the \ntransition be at the expense of SMEs, with large industrial enterprises in special economic \nzones and large logistics companies playing the dominant role? Even if several of these \nfactors together provide the impetus, there still remain issues concerning pace and \nsequencing of specific categories of initiatives.\nRegional corridors have been discussed extensively in urban planning and spatial \norganization of transportation, for example, in the form of growth poles or transport \ncorridors.3 Growth poles are centers of economic activities from which growth gets \ndistributed spatially within a regional urban system, but this process is uneven, with the \ncore benefiting first and the periphery becoming integrated only later. In the growth poles \ntheory, transportation is a factor of accessibility that reinforces the importance of poles. \nIn the context of regional urban planning, transport corridors are an accumulation of \nflows of services and infrastructures of various modes, and their development is linked to \nincreased urbanization and urban development.4\nThe use of the term \u201cregional\u201d in urban planning is of course quite different from its \nmeaning in regional cooperation due to the former being in a national context while the \nlatter applies across sovereign states. This cross-border connotation leads to important \ndifferences in stakeholders, policy space, and institutional options for coordinating actions \ncompared to subnational urban planning (Marrian 2001).5 The direct relevance of regional \ncorridors in urban planning is thus diluted when the context is regional cooperation across \ncountries and cross-border regional corridors.\n2  Rostow\u2019s model of national development based on stages of growth became popular in the 1960s but was later \ncharacterized as being mechanical and historical (in the sense the end result is known at the outset) and thus not \nuseful. For a basic discussion of the \u201cstages-of-growth\u201d model, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostovian_take-\noff_model.\n3  See, for example, Rodrigue et al. (2009).\n4  The concept of regional corridors is also utilized in other contexts such as environment management, and in \nmovement of animals and spread of communicable diseases.\n5  Corridors in urban planning are frequently likened to a major services duct that accommodates a number of \ndifferent engineering services within the one channel; or a human arm containing veins and arteries, bones \n(\u201cspines\u201d), and elbow and hands (\u201cnodes\u201d). The corridors are connecting large activity nodes, traversing urban \nor interurban areas, and containing a high concentration of population and mixed land uses, such as shopping, \nsocial, cultural, and sporting facilities, and a large amount of residential accommodation. This implies a very \ndifferent set of questions, institutions, and stakeholders than in regional (cooperation) corridors.", "Regional Corridors Development in Regional Cooperation | 3\nIn the next two sections, this paper develops and elaborates a simple framework for \nassessing development of regional corridors in the context of regional cooperation.6 \nThe framework allows bringing together and analyzing links between various concepts \nof importance in regional cooperation such as (i) corridor development, (ii) trade and \ntransport facilitation, (iii) measuring and monitoring performance of corridors, and \n(iv) logistics development. Analyzing such links highlights complementarities but also \ntrade-offs across these categories that may need to be recognized in operational work in \nregional cooperation.\nThe framework for regional corridors development presented here is subsequently applied \nin Section IV to the GMS regional cooperation program, where corridor development \nremains a central guiding principle. The GMS program, a flagship regional cooperation \ninitiative begun in 1992 and supported by ADB, is among the first proponents of the \neconomic corridor approach to regional cooperation, having been adopted in its early \nyears. Given the centrality of corridor development to the GMS program, the framework \npresented here has several important implications for the program going forward, as it \nmoves into starting a third decade of regional cooperation.\nFinally, in Section V, the framework for corridor development is used to discuss an \nappropriate methodology for monitoring performance of regional corridors and their \ndevelopment. There is increasing commitment of resources to improving transport and \ntrade facilitation (TTF) along the GMS corridors\u2014their \u201csoftware\u201d\u2014and thus a growing \ndemand to monitor the performance of the corridors in terms of trade facilitation. The \nproposed framework is useful in clarifying the need to ensure that the growing locus \nof TTF resources and activities does not lead to an unnecessarily narrow domain that \nmay be characterized as \u201cTTF for the sake of TTF\u201d. By embedding TTF within the \nbroader context of corridors development, the framework can contribute to improving the \noperational context of TTF initiatives and to better prioritization of scarce resources. \nII. Two Dimensions of Regional Corridors\nThe essential structural components of a regional corridor are its outer nodes or urban \ncenters and the transport connectivity between them, along with other smaller nodes that \nmay exist in between and the land surrounding the corridor in its vicinity. For corridors \nto be viable, they must make economic sense through encompassing actual or potential \neconomic growth, which requires at the least that the nodes linked by the corridor are \nsubstantive centers of economic activity. Corridor development does not create economic \nstrength so much as it channels, focuses, and amplifies the potential for economic \ngrowth. Thus, a corridor from \u201cnowhere to nowhere through nowhere\u201d would not be very \n6  Subsequent references to \u201cregional corridors\u201d will refer not to urban planning but to corridors in the context of \nregional cooperation across sovereign states.", "4 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 258\nmeaningful. Similarly, a corridor linking two substantive nodes but with no potential for \ngrowth in between (because of adverse geography such as extremely rugged terrain or \ndesert) is also of limited interest, as is a maritime \u201ccorridor\u201d linking two ports.\nThis is particularly true when we think in terms of a corridor development approach to \nregional cooperation. The corridor development approach can be described as using \ntransport corridors to provide a backbone or spatial focus for regional cooperation \nprojects and activities, clustering them along corridors or at nodal centers on the \ncorridors. This is expected to help develop surrounding areas, including through \ncatalyzing other investment from within and outside the region. The spatial focus can \nalso facilitate prioritization of regional projects, and coordination of national projects \namong neighboring countries. The corridor development approach is thus a very practical \nresponse to maximizing the impact of typically limited resources available for regional \nprojects. \nIn this section, the two building blocks of a basic framework for regional corridor \ndevelopment are analyzed, namely, the extent to which the corridors are national or \nregional, and the extent to which they are narrow or broad. This allows a more detailed \nelaboration of various aspects of corridor development in the next section, including \nconsiderations of sequencing over time. \nA.  National versus Regional Corridor\nWhat constitutes a regional project as distinct from a national one? This is of course a \ncentral question in regional cooperation. Conceptually, regional projects would comprise \nprojects that embody cross-border spillovers (positive or negative externalities), which \nmay then require joint or coordinated actions by two or more countries. Good examples \nof these are pure regional goods such as sustainable use of shared natural resources, \ncontrolling regional communicable diseases, air pollution, and cross-border crimes such \nas trafficking, etc. While \u201cregional\u201d aspects of public goods are relatively straightforward to \nidentify, this does not translate as widely in the context of infrastructure projects such as \nroads.7 There are examples in energy infrastructure, such as production of hydropower in \none country for sale to another country, but this may be independent of any externalities.8 \nThe regional dimension of transport projects, which are the focus here, is even more \nnuanced. \nFor infrastructure projects, the operational definition used by ADB is wider, going beyond \njoint (or even coordinated) projects across countries, or projects with cross-border \nexternalities, to also include \u201cnational projects with regional implications\u201d, such as a \n7  Theoretical examples can be easily constructed of cross-border spillovers of costs or benefits for road projects, but \ntheir practical relevance is limited.\n8  However, there may be cross-border externalities due to environmental impact of large hydropower projects.", "Regional Corridors Development in Regional Cooperation | 5\nnational transport system that is part of a regional transport system, or a national power \ngrid within a regional power grid.9\nIndeed, the most common category of regional infrastructure projects in ADB operations \nare \u201cnational projects with regional implications\u201d. This definition of regional projects is \nnot only operationally relevant (albeit difficult to standardize in practice), but also useful \nconceptually because it explicitly recognizes the intrinsic duality of many infrastructure \nprojects, specifically transport corridors, as both a national entity as well as a regional \none. \nFigure 1: Intercountry Distribution of GMS Corridors (percent)\nNSEC Eastern Sub:  501 km 41 59\nNSEC Central Sub:  695 km 51 49\nNSEC Western Sub via Myanmar:  1,462 km 39 14 47\nNSEC Western Sub via Lao PDR:  1,434 km 41 12 47\nEWEC:  1,481 km 14 13 55 18\nSEC Intercorridor Link:  1,149 km 65 35\nSEC Southern Coastal Sub:  1,000 km 30 42 28\nSEC Northern Sub:  1,609 km 65 20 15\nSEC Central Sub:  944 km 53 33 14\n0 20 40 60 80 100\nCambodia PRC Lao PDR\nMyanmar Thailand Viet Nam\nEWEC = East-West Economic Corridor; GMS = Greater Mekong Subregion; km = kilometers; NSEC = North-South Economic Corridor;  \nPRC = People's Republic of China; SEC = Southern Economic Corridor; sub = subcorridor.\nNote:   The horizontal axis represents the estimated country-wise length of GMS corridors as a percentage of the total.\nSources: ADB (2010a, 2010b, 2010c); ADB staff estimates.\nThis duality is quite apt for transportation infrastructure. To illustrate, Figure 1 provides \nsummary data on the three GMS corridors, in terms of the fraction of total length of their \nsubcorridors lying within specific countries. For each corridor/subcorridor, it is evident that \nthe corridor lies substantially within a particular country. For example, 53% of the central \nsubcorridor of the Southern Economic Corridor (SEC) lies within Cambodia, while 65% \nof the northern subcorridor of the SEC is also within Cambodia. Similarly, 55% of the \nEast West Economic Corridor (EWEC) is accounted for by Thailand, which also accounts \nfor 33% of the central subcorridor of the SEC. Given that the corridors are almost 1,000 \n9  The ADB Operations Manual Section B1/BP (2010) defines regional projects as also including other categories \nsuch as those that (i) facilitate regional policy dialogue that leads to regional agreements promoting trade, \ninvestment, and monetary and financial cooperation; (ii) support research and knowledge generation on issues \nrelated to the four pillars of the regional cooperation and integration strategy, and promote knowledge sharing \nand dissemination among the ADB\u2019s developing member countries; and (iii) support initiatives or strengthen the \ninstitutional capacity of regional groupings, such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, GMS, CAREC, etc.", "6 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 258\nkilometers or more, these are substantial stretches within a specific country. From the \nperspective of that country, it would be strange to not consider the corridor as a national \ncorridor. This is particularly true if the corridor represents a major route within the country, \nas is true for example, for the central subcorridor of the SEC in Cambodia. Nonetheless, \nit would be equally valid to consider the substantive stretch of the SEC in Cambodia as \nalso comprising part of a regional corridor.\nThe intrinsic national/regional duality of these corridors implies that the same national \ncorridor can have an increasing regional aspect to the extent it reaches across borders. \nThe latter would entail the nodes of the corridor being across national borders and having \neconomic attraction to each other through mutual demand for factors of production and/\nor goods. Increased regionality would also depend upon the ease with which factors and \ngoods can cross borders. \nB.  Narrow versus Broad Corridor\nA corridor starts with the physical connectivity, a road or a highway connecting two or \nmore nodes. It is natural to view the corridor as the means of transport connectivity, \nnamely, the highway. This view is useful and practical, but narrow relative to the view that \na corridor comprises not only the highway per se but also the areas around the highway \nthat use it.  The relationship between development of connectivity and of areas or zones \naround the connecting infrastructure is not always one way in terms of causality\u2014demand \nfor connectivity may arise due to developed areas already in existence, while connectivity \nmay lead to new or further development. \nThe concepts of narrow and broad corridors are depicted in Figure 2 below, where Y and \nZ denote two nodes or end-points connected by a highway. \nFigure 2: Narrow versus Broad Corridors\nY Z\n\u2022A \u2022B\nSource:  Author\u2018s representation.\nThe narrowly defined corridor is the \u201cdumb-bell\u201d comprising Y and Z, and the significance \nof the middle (highway/corridor) is simply that it connects Y and Z. However, consider \nnow the points A and B lying off the highway at distance of A and B, respectively. Let \nC  represent the cost of moving from A to the highway, and let C  represent the same \nA B", "Regional Corridors Development in Regional Cooperation | 7\nfor B. Presumably, C  (C ) depends upon the distance between A and the highway, the \nA B\nroad conditions that will determine the fuel costs and costs of wear and tear as well as \nthe speed or time to travel, the availability of transport vehicles appropriate for the road \nconditions, and other factors such as the extent of decentralization and local taxes/\nsurcharges. \nThe choice of moving from A to B lies between going directly across versus going to the \nhighway from A, traveling along the highway, and then getting off to reach B. If the cost of \ndirectly going from A to B is C  and the cost of traveling on the highway is C , then it is \nAB H\nbetter to go from A to B via the highway if \nC  + C + C  \u2264  C (1)\nA B  H  AB    \nAll points off the highway like A and B that satisfy the relationship above can also be \ndeemed as part of the corridor, which would then constitute a broader view of the corridor \nthan the dumb-bell connecting X and Y.  \nThe representation above is at the most basic level necessary for the present purposes. \nMore complexity can be brought in to incorporate other features. For example, the end \npoints/nodes A and B may be represented more realistically as larger, concentric rings of \nurbanization with the corridor opening up into a funnel shape as it comes closer to each. \nSimilarly, existence of another node near or in-between A and B, or of other corridors in \nthe vicinity, is also abstracted from for purpose of simplicity in illustration. \nTo formalize the discussion above, let the distance between A and B along the highway \nbe denoted by D, and let D also be the distance between A and B if traveling directly, \nwithout using the highway. Let C , the cost along the highway, be proportional to D, i.e.,\nH\nC   =  \u03b8(w). D                     (2)\nH\nwhere w = (w, i = 1,2,\u2026 ) denotes various determinants of \u03b8 and thus the cost of \ni\ntransport along the highway, such as road quality, road congestion, and other such \nfactors.\nSimilarly, the cost of traveling from A to the highway can also be written as proportional to \nthe distance traveled (to the highway), denoted as \u03b4. \nC  = \u03bb(w). \u03b4                     (3)\nA\nwhere  w again denotes factors determining the cost. We can also assume without any \nloss that the distance and cost of transport from B to the highway is the same as that for \nA, i.e, C  = C  = \u03bb(w). \u03b4.\nB A", "8 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 258\nFinally, let \u03c6(v).D be the cost for traveling directly from A to B without using the highway \n(C ), where the factors determining costs of transport, v, are assumed for simplicity \nAB\nto be distinct from those in w. Since the highway has lower costs of transportation, by \ndefinition \u03c6> \u03b8.\nFor the highway to be preferred in use, equation (1) above can be rewritten as \n2 \u03bb (w). \u03b4 + \u03b8(w). D \u2264 \u03c6(v).D, and if \u03b4* is the value that results in equality then\n\u03b4*(w,D; v) = [\u03c6(v) - \u03b8(w)]. D/ 2 \u03bb (w) (4)\n \nwhere \u03b4* is the distance off the highway that defines the limit of areas that are integral \nusers of the corridor\u2019s connectivity. It can thus be interpreted as the (one-sided) width of \nthe transport corridor given the nodes A and B. \nEquation (4) provides straightforward and intuitive relationships between the corridor \nwidth and the parameters w and D, namely,10\n(i)  \u2202\u03b4*/\u2202D > 0, or the width of the corridor is positively related to the distance \nbetween A and B. The greater the distance necessary to be traveled on the \n(lower cost) highway, the more worthwhile it is for farther points to use it \ndespite having to travel extra to reach the corridor;\n(ii)  \u2202\u03b4*/\u2202w > 0 if \u2202\u03b8(w)/\u2202w < 0, implying increase in any parameter w that \nj j j\nreduces costs of transport on the corridor will widen the corridor; and \nconversely, \n(iii)  \u2202\u03b4*/\u2202w  > 0 if \u2202\u03b8(w)/\u2202w  < 0, implying a factor w  results in a narrower \nk k k\ncorridor if its increase results in higher costs along the corridor.\nThus, if there is an increase in stoppages for toll charges of various kinds along the \nhighway, the width of the corridor will be decreased, while investment in upgrading the \nhighway will imply a widening of the corridor. \nWe can also look at situations where a factor affects costs on the corridor but not on the \nlink from A (or B) to the corridor, and vice versa, i.e., \n(iv)   A factor k such that \u2202\u03b8(w)/\u2202w \u2260 0 while \u2202\u03bb(w)/\u2202w  = 0. Thus, factor k \nk  k\naffects costs on the highway corridor but not between points A or B and the \ncorridor. This will result in widening (narrowing) of the corridor if the effect \non \u03b8 is inverse.  For example, introducing trade facilitation measures to \n10 From total differentiation of (2), \u2202\u03b4*/\u2202w = -( \u03b8\u2019 + 2\u03b4*\u03bb\u2019)/2 \u03bb, where \u03b8\u2019 and \u03bb\u2019 are derivatives with respect to \nj\nw. \u03b8\u2019 and \u03bb\u2019 have the same sign (unless one of them is zero), implying \u2202\u03b4*/\u2202w < (>) 0 if \u03b8\u2019 and \u03bb\u2019 > (<) 0.\nj j ", "Regional Corridors Development in Regional Cooperation | 9\nlower costs on the highway will increase corridor width, even though costs \nof traveling from A (or B) to the corridor are unaffected.\n(v)  Conversely, consider a factor j such that \u2202\u03b8(w)/\u2202w = 0 while \u2202\u03bb(w)/\u2202w \u2260 0. \nj  j\nThis represents a factor that affects costs of transportation from A (or B) \nto the corridor, but not costs along the corridor. For example, a rural roads \nproject that reduces costs of linking points like A and B to the highway \nwithout affecting costs on the highway itself.  This again would result in \nwidening of the corridor.\nFinally, note that the analysis of corridor width above applies specifically to the stretch \nbetween points A and B. Outside that range, the corridor would not have any width, \nunless there are other such points. This would imply that greater presence or density of \npoints like A and B\u2014essentially urban or semi-urban nodes off the corridor\u2014would also \ncontribute to widening of the corridor.11 \nThese relationships can be used to consider various determinants of costs of \ntransportation as shown in Table 1 below, which shows the impact of specific factors and \ntypes of regional projects on development of the corridor. \nTable 1: Corridor Effect of Selected Factors/Projects\nFactor/Project Relationship to Corridor Effect\n\u03b8 (direct) \u03bb (indirect)\nHighway/corridor upgrading Inverse Inverse Widening\nRoad safety improvement Inverse Inverse Widening\nIncreased costs at borders Inverse Nil Narrowing\nIncreased transport costs due to lack of sector  Inverse Inverse Narrowing\ncompetitiveness\nLogistics development Inverse Inverse Widening\nRural road improvement Nil Inverse Widening\nCorridor town development Nil Nil Widening*\u00a0\nValue chain and SME development Nil Nil Widening*\nTourism infrastructure Nil Inverse Widening*\nSME = small and medium enterprise.\n* Corridor widening impacts either by bringing into existence more nodes off the corridor (points such as A or B), or by developing \nthe existing ones. Improved tourism infrastructure in assets off the corridors may lead to corridor widening through \nimproved secondary roads and also through increased nodes off the corridor (even if secondary road improvement is not \nincluded in tourism infrastructure). SME development and integration of such firms into value chains will also increase \ndensity of off-corridor nodes, thus leading to corridor widening. \nSource:  Author\u2018s representation.\n11 The simplified formalization here does not address the issues of corridor congestion and demand or \nbenefits of traveling from A to B. Presumably, at initial stages of corridor development, congestion would \nnot be a significant constraint, and can thus be ignored. Expanding the analysis to bring in the benefits of \ntraveling can be done but is beyond the scope of the immediate analysis.", "10 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 258\nProjects such as creating 2\u20134-lane highways or reduction of highway hazards would lead \nto corridor widening through reduced transportation costs. Increased competitiveness of \nthe transport sector, often characterized by monopolistic practices and other distortions, \nis another cost-reducing factor that can contribute to corridor widening. Improved logistics \nsimilarly can lead to corridor widening by reducing transport costs along major routes. \nIII. A Framework for Corridor Development\nThe two dimensions of corridors in the previous section\u2014national/regional and narrow/\nbroad\u2014provide a useful framework to assess the components for development of \ncorridors and their interrelations. The framework is presented in Figure 3 below, where \nthe x-axis shows the national/regional characterization of corridor, representing increased \nregionality of the corridor as one moves to the right, and the y-axis represents the narrow/\nbroad dimension, with increased widening of the corridor moving up the axis. Together \nthese two dimensions divide into four quadrants or zones.\nZone I, representing the national and narrow stage of the corridor, is a useful starting \npoint, marked by the corridor or highway\u2019s initial construction, or by upgrading of existing \n(lower-quality) roads. This phase is obviously intensive in infrastructure investments, and \nby the nature of such investments, can last over several years. \nIn terms of sequencing, Zone II (National, Broad) and Zone III (Regional, Narrow) are \ninterchangeable (i.e., either or both may be pursued at any time), but the two are quite \ndistinct in content. In particular, the locus of actions for promoting Zone II development \nlies primarily within national governments (discussed further in the next section), while \nZone III development requires regional cooperation. Another substantive difference \nbetween the two zones relates to the level of investments required. Zone III is relatively \n\u201cinvestment-light\u201d, with the focus being on strengthening and developing the software for \nthe physical infrastructure already in place, while Zone II is \u201cinvestment-intensive\u201d due to \nthe continued need for developing diverse infrastructure.", "Regional Corridors Development in Regional Cooperation | 11\nFigure 3: Four Zones of Regional Corridors Development\nZone II Zone IV\nNational +   Regional +    \nBroad Broad\nd\noa (Area development,  (Cross-border \nBr SMEs, rural  economic \n> \nw ----- roads) zones)\no\narr Zone I  Zone III\nN\nNational +  Regional +  \nNarrow Narrow\n(Construction,  (Trade facilitation, \nupgrading) logistics)\nNational                  Regional\nSource:  Author\u2018s representation.\nFor Zone II, as noted previously, there are several initiatives that may be undertaken \nfor widening the corridor. These include activities that may broadly be termed \u201carea \ndevelopment plans\u201d through a variety of methods such as urbanization, improving \nurban infrastructure, promoting industrial development, enhancing business climate and \ncapacities for SMEs, and investing in tourism infrastructure. Within the national context, \napproaches promoting integrated rural development for corridor-linked rural areas are \nanother example of Zone II development of corridors. Other initiatives such as developing \nsecondary or rural roads that link to the corridors, improving road safety, and enhancing \ncompetition in the transport sector would also contribute to corridor widening. While the \ninterventions above refer to role of the public sector, clearly substantial private investment \nwould need to complement the public sector. This will require government policies that \nencourage crowding in of private investment, and also utilize public\u2013private partnership as \nappropriate.\nZone III is the transformation of the (narrow) national into a regional corridor through \nextension beyond national boundaries. This may take the form of linking national \ncorridors, but is more usefully viewed as the subsequent stage of diminishing the height \nand density of the barriers at national boundaries through increasing trade, combined \nwith enhanced transport and trade facilitation. The focus of the \u201cnarrow\u201d corridor is on \nmoving goods and people at fast speed and least cost from \u201cpoint to point\u201d. The \u201cpoints\u201d \nare usually urban centers, which may now be in more than one country along the \ncorridor. These centers may be dominated by manufacturing and, within manufacturing, ", "12 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 258\nby large and medium enterprises. Areas between the centers do not have high priority. \nConsequently, there is less focus on SME development, which typically is common \nin the rural or semi-urban areas between the centers served by the regional corridor. \nEnhancing the regionality of narrow corridors may also be supported by developing \nand strengthening the larger logistics companies,12 and by improving vehicles and \nstandardization of procedures on the corridor. The private sector again has a critical role \nin Zone III development, particularly in the strengthening of the logistics sector that can \nreduce the costs and increase the flow of internodal exchange of goods and services \nacross the corridor. The private sector also has to take the lead in enhancing transport \nand trade facilitation as the lead stakeholder.\nFinally, Zone IV marks the last stage of corridor development, wherein the transformation \nof the corridor from a narrow, national entity into a broad and seamless regional entity \nis completed. This is an advanced stage that is neither inevitable, nor easy to achieve \nin the short run. Movement toward Zone IV corridors may require joint regional plans, \nor joint plans for cross-border area development by the concerned countries or, at the \nleast, coordination of national plans. Clearly, the former option is not trivial, and may \nnot be feasible for a long time if it will need mechanisms for fiscal or other transfers \nto be effective. The alternative, of coordinating national plans (including private-sector \ninvestment and activities) is a more viable option. \nThis framework is relatively static in the sense it does not delve into issues of sequencing \nand dynamics within a specific zone. Yet there is a sequence across the four zones, with \nZone I clearly preceding Zones II and III, which in turn are necessary as prerequisites \nfor Zone IV development. Successful implementation of Zone II and Zone III is not \nonly chronologically prior, but the quality of Zone II and III implementation will also \nfundamentally affect the quality of Zone IV development and growth.\nIV. Implications for the GMS Program\nThe GMS program is a flagship regional cooperation initiative of the ADB, started in \n1992. It includes Cambodia, People\u2019s Democratic Republic of Lao (Lao PDR), Myanmar, \nThailand, Viet Nam and two provinces of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Yunnan \nProvince and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.13 Three regional corridors have been \npromoted in the GMS program: (i) the East\u2013West Economic Corridor (EWEC), the only \ndirect and continuous land route between the Andaman Sea and the South China Sea; \n(ii) the North\u2013South Economic Corridor (NSEC) with three subcorridors, namely, Kunming \nto Bangkok via the Lao PDR or Myanmar; Kunming to Ha Noi and on to Hai Phong, and \n12 Logistics development in principle can be within Zone I also, if there is adequate demand for value chains \nwithin the domestic economy.\n13 See http://www.adb.org/gms/ for more details on the GMS program.", "Regional Corridors Development in Regional Cooperation | 13\nNanning to Ha Noi; and (iii) the Southern Economic Corridor (SEC), which includes three \nsubcorridors including the route linking Bangkok to Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh City.\nThe GMS program adopted the economic corridor approach to regional development in \n1998, and has anchored regional projects and initiatives on these corridors. Continuing \nits emphasis on development of the regional corridors, the GMS countries established \nthe Economic Corridor Forum (ECF) in Kunming, PRC, in June 2008. The ECF is a \nministerial-level multisector platform for coordination, networking, and facilitating initiatives \nto develop the GMS corridors. \nWith almost $12 billion worth of investment projects completed or under implementation, \nand entering its third decade, the GMS program is one of the more advanced regional \ncooperation initiatives. Given the centrality of corridor development in GMS cooperation, \nthe simple framework presented here has some direct implications for the GMS program. \n(i)  National/regional dichotomy has little relevance to the GMS program. A \nclear implication of the framework presented here is the rejection of the strict \nnational/regional dichotomy for corridor development. The logic for rejecting \nexplicit regional/national dichotomy in the context of GMS corridors is reinforced \nwhen second-generation projects are examined: once the larger national/regional \ncorridors are already in place, the forced dichotomy of national versus regional \nproject becomes further diluted. A project linking other parts of the country (urban \nor semi-urban) to the regional corridor is legitimately as much a regional project \nas it is national. As shown in Table 1, a wide variety of projects have direct impact \non regional corridors, through either increasing their regional characteristic or \nwidening their area of influence. In this sense, a criterion for relevance of national/\nregional dichotomy may be the extent to which the early, national projects (Zone I) \nhave been completed.\n  Thus, it is necessary in the GMS context to reject the strict national versus \nregional dichotomy, which is administratively useful but conceptually less \nrewarding, particularly for second-generation regional projects. In an advanced \nregional cooperation program like GMS, very often regional is national and \nnational is regional. In terms of the operational definition used by ADB for defining \nregional projects as \u201cnational projects with regional implications\u201d, it may be argued \nthat for a program like GMS with second-generation projects, one should go \nfurther and look instead at \u201cregional projects with national implications\u201d.14 The \ndifference is more than semantics, and is particularly relevant in the context of \nsubsequent transition from Zone II toward Zone IV corridor development. The \ngenesis and rationale of \u201cnational projects with regional implications\u201d is national \nwherein the regionality is an addendum or a side benefit. In contrast, \u201cregional \n14 Or more strictly, \u201cprojects regional in scope but national in implementation\u201d. This is just another way of \nphrasing the oft quoted maxim, \u201cThink regionally, act nationally\u201d. ", "14 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 258\nprojects with national implication\u201d have to be justified in a regional framework and \nlogic, constrained by the requirement to meet adequate national development \ncriteria.15 \n  A good example of a mechanism in which this approach is operating may be the \nMekong River Commission (MRC), an intergovernmental body whose program is \nintended to be \u201cregional\u201d, covering the countries and areas sharing the Mekong \nRiver and whose projects are \u201cregional with national implications\u201d. Despite some \nissues facing the MRC on the use of the Mekong River, it has a clear regional \nframework and mandate anchored on the Mekong River. In a sense, the members \nhave defined the Mekong Basin as a regional entity for which planning and \nexecution of (national) projects are envisioned to be coordinated by and through \nthe MRC.  \n(ii)  The GMS program needs to transition into second generation. For much of \nthe first phase of the GMS program comprising the 2 decades since its inception \nin 1992, the program has remained anchored on Zone I. Of the total investments \nmade under the GMS program ($11.8 billion as of end-2010), more than 90% has \ngone into construction and/or upgrading of highways related to the three GMS \ncorridors.  The GMS corridors are not yet completed, with some segments yet to \nbe developed. Nonetheless, the overwhelming proportion of Zone I development of \nGMS corridors is in the advanced stage of completion.\n(iii)  The second generation will comprise Zone II and Zone III development. \nGiven that the GMS program has to transition into other zones, the question is \nwhich zone(s), and in what sequence?16 As already noted, Zone II and III can \nbe sequentially concomitant while Zone IV is operationally meaningful only at \na subsequent stage of regional development and cooperation in the GMS. The \nmovement to Zones II and/or III has to be the next stage of the GMS, constituting \nthe second-generation of regional cooperation initiatives in GMS.\n(iv)  Zone III activities are increasingly integrated into the GMS program. \nReflecting the need for transition, there has been a clear and growing shift in \nthe GMS program toward Zone III activities for development of the corridors. \nTransport and trade facilitation (Zone III) has been recognized as a high priority \nin recent years, and in 2010, the GMS countries agreed upon an Action Plan for \nTransport and Trade Facilitation. Development of logistics and freight forwarding \n15 Put differently, the difference between \u201cnational project with regional implications\u201d and \u201cregional project \nwith national implications\u201d is not in the implementation, which in both cases is national, but in the objective \nfunction being maximized and the constraints. In one case, the objective would be to maximize national \ntarget (GDP or welfare) subject to a minimum benefit to regional countries. The alternative would be to \nmaximize a regional target subject to minimum benefit to the country implementing the project.\n16 The analysis here excludes another option, namely, to start other corridors, including railways. \nDevelopment of railway corridors will likely grow over time, but the focus here is on development of \nexisting regional corridors.", "Regional Corridors Development in Regional Cooperation | 15\nservices is also growing in priority. It is expected that these areas will be the \ncenter of considerable resources and efforts on the part of GMS stakeholders \nin the medium term. Several development partners have also embraced the \nenhancement of Zone III initiatives since these are consistent with requirements \nof the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Economic Community, and are \nalso \u201cinvestment-light\u201d. Transport and trade facilitation issues are admittedly \ncomplex, requiring institutional changes and capacity building, but are relatively \nless resource-intensive since no major investments are necessary in infrastructure. \nSome investments may be required for equipment, border facilities, laboratories, \netc. but the scale is modest compared to investments needed for developing or \nimproving physical infrastructure. \n(v)\t Zone\tII\tdevelopment\tremains\tlow\tkey,\treflecting\tcomplexity\tand\tresource\t\nconstraints. Unlike Zone III however, the shift into Zone II development is not \nas pronounced yet, although a few projects and initiatives are under preparation \n(such as rural roads project in Cambodia and a project on development of \ntowns along corridors). The framework above suggests there is a need to \ngreatly increase the resources and projects for Zone II development of the GMS \ncorridors. Why is the shift toward Zone II not as pronounced? One possibility may \nbe the fact that Zone III transition is less resource-intensive being \u201cinvestment-\nlight\u201d, while Zone II needs substantially more investment of resources. It is also \npossible that Zone II development is even more difficult (than Zone III) in terms \nof conceptualizing and implementing projects. For example, development of rural \nroads, even if linking to regional corridors, often faces difficulty within national \nprograms due to constraints of unfavorable commercial cost\u2013benefit ratios. To \nmitigate these, it may be necessary to package the roads with other infrastructure \ninvestments to increase not only the link to markets through rural roads, but also \ncapacity and skills for producing for the markets. Developing and implementing \nsuch integrated rural development projects is inherently more complex than just \nbuilding roads, and has often proved difficult in the past. However a generation \nspent in Zone I should not make it into a \u201ccomfort zone\u201d for the GMS program, \nleading to inertia toward the complexity and different challenges of the investment-\nintensive Zone II.\n(vi)  Greater integration of Zone II in GMS program is a necessity. Notwithstanding \nthe difficulties, the challenges of Zone II actually are opportunities for the next \nstage of GMS corridor development. A shift toward investment-light Zone III alone \nwould not be sufficient for the GMS program, and would actually intensify the \npangs of the needed generational transition. The success of the GMS program \nin its first generation in Zone I has been defined by its essential characteristic as \nan investment-driven vehicle around which the member countries have coalesced \nto cooperate on other issues. Thus, a transition to Zone III minus Zone II risks \ndraining the GMS program of its well-earned gravitas and the key ingredient to its ", "16 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 258\nsuccess. It may also lead to growth that would be geographically imbalanced and \nless inclusive than desired.\n(vii)\t Zone\tII\ttransition\tshould\tbe\tanchored\ton\ta\tregional\tmaster\tplan.\tThe GMS \ncountries straddle a dynamic region between large and fast-growing economies \nin East and South Asia, and it is easy to project economic activity of several \ntrillions of dollars in the expanded region within the next decades. Growth nodes \nof today may be surpassed by new centers catering to the increasing trade \nflows accompanying the high levels of economic activity. This is a good time to \ndo a regional master plan for the GMS subregion based on current trends and \nmedium-term forecasts in regional economic activity, including trade and urban \ndevelopment. The regional master plan can ensure that increased channeling of \nresources in Zone II development is also based on good cost\u2013benefit analysis \nfrom the start. The regional master plan can also serve as the launch pad for \ndiscussing higher-level cooperation in the GMS program in its third decade, \nincluding increased regional cross-border investments.\n  The regional plan can and should incorporate issues that are increasingly \nand repeatedly being emphasized by the GMS member countries as critical \ngoing forward, namely, environment and climate change. This recognizes that \nZone II development of corridors has to use them and build on them, and also \nsustain them over the long run. If we view Zone II development as enhancing \nor preserving the natural infrastructure along the corridors, then Zone II would \nbe comparable to Zone I, (with the difference being replacement of \u201cphysical\u201d \nby \u201cnatural\u201d infrastructure).17 The GMS countries are quite vulnerable to climate \nchange and the natural infrastructure of these countries is under great stress.  \nEmbedding the framework for Zone II development within climate change \nand environment management also has the benefit of encompassing several \ninitiatives already under implementation among GMS countries with the same \nunderlying motivation (i.e., sustainable development) under the rubric of disaster \nrisk reduction, natural resource management, and climate change adaptation/\nmitigation. At the same time, the regionality of environment and climate change \napproach is quite obvious. \n(viii)  Economic\tCorridors\tForum\tmay\tprovide\tthe\tseeds\tof\tZone\tIV\tregional\t\ncorridors development. The Economic Corridors Forum (ECF), which has \nalready met twice and is seeking a well-defined role within the overall GMS \nframework, should be developed as the nascent platform for Zone IV development \nover the longer term. In the short term, the ECF should focus on coordinating \nZone III initiatives (it has focused on transport and trade facilitation to date, and \nthat should continue), but it should also incorporate within its active ambit Zone \n17 It would also provide an apt development role for GMS development partners, including ADB, given the \nrelative ease of financing hardware infrastructure today compared to 2 decades ago; at the same time, \nresources for enhancing natural infrastructure are more difficult to mobilize.", "Regional Corridors Development in Regional Cooperation | 17\nII development of the GMS regional corridors. The development of the regional \nmaster plan and monitoring its implementation and its updating could be added \nprojects of the ECF in the short term.\nV. Monitoring Corridor Performance\nIn view of the large resources already invested in the GMS corridors, there is a need \nto monitor their performance. This need is further underlined by the increased shift \ntoward strengthening the intangible \u201csoftware\u201d of the corridors. Sporadic attempts \nhave been made in recent years to measure transport costs along the GMS corridors, \nusing the time/cost distance method (TCD) of the United Nations Economic and Social \nCommission for Asia and the Pacific,18 and at selected border sites on the corridors, \nthe time-release surveys based on the World Customs Organization methodology.  The \nCAREC regional program has already instituted a system to generate quarterly indicators \nbased on the TCD, with the data being generated in collaboration with associations of \nfreight forwarders and road associations. This section addresses the question: what \nis the appropriate methodology to monitor corridor performance for GMS corridors? \nThe question is motivated by the fact that it is not advisable to take \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d the \napproach developed in CAREC and apply it to the GMS for two sets of reasons: there are \nsignificant differences between CAREC and GMS corridors, and the framework developed \nearlier indicates there are several aspects to corridor development and performance, and \nthe time/cost distance and time-release surveys cover only a small component of these. \nBoth sets of issues are considered below. \nA.  Differing Contexts of CAREC and GMS \nA major difference in the context of the CAREC and GMS corridors is that the GMS \ncorridors account for a much smaller proportion of trade than the CAREC corridors \nconnecting landlocked countries. GMS has a long sea coast and a lot of the trade is \nmoved over short sea distances, e.g., Viet Nam coal to the PRC. Unlike CAREC, GMS \nalso has a substantial number of navigable rivers and coastal and river ports. The GMS \nrivers are active commerce corridors that exist in parallel to road corridors. Finally, many \nCAREC countries aim to be transit countries between Asia and Europe. This is generally \nnot the case in GMS, though Myanmar may be quite effective for the PRC to reach the \nIndian Ocean, while Viet Nam can be a transit country for Cambodian exports; the Lao \nPDR is landlocked, needing exports and imports to transit through neighboring countries. \nAt the level of software and institutions, the shared history of CAREC countries as part of \nthe former Soviet Union implies greater prevalence of a common language, and similarity \nin institutional frameworks, laws, and regulations related to transport.\n18 The methodology relies on cost and time characteristics of every section along a transit route to identify \nthe location and size of inefficiencies and bottlenecks.", "18 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 258\nB.  Corridor Development and Corridor Monitoring\nMonitoring corridor performance through the time/distance cost methodology or time \nrelease surveys implicitly incorporates a narrow view of the corridor, namely, the specific \ntransport route connecting two specified points. On the other hand, the concept of \ncorridor when discussing corridor development is broader. Emphasizing measures of \none kind at the expense of the other would provide an incomplete and unbalanced view \nsince some measures to develop a corridor broadly may complement development of \nthe narrowly defined corridor, but others may entail a tradeoff. It is important therefore \nto contextualize and firmly anchor corridor performance monitoring on development and \ngrowth, which can be aided by using the framework provided earlier. This would suggest \nusing indicators for corridor development and performance that reflect all the zones, or at \nleast Zones I to III.\nConsider first the border trading costs as measured by time release surveys. These \nare important indicators of Zone III development of the corridor, and thus a very \nuseful indicator of attempts at transport and trade facilitation, which is a growing area \nof emphasis in the GMS program. Yet, it is also important to underline that trade \nfacilitation has to begin with trade. This means trade facilitation, as measured by costs \nof transactions at the border, has to take due cognizance of actual trade flows (including \ninformal trade if the latter is a significant activity, as suggested by anecdotal evidence \nfor some GMS countries with relatively porous borders). Put differently, measures of \ntrade facilitation at the borders should be trade-weighted, reflecting the quantitative trade \nflowing through that border. For example, high costs at a border crossing point where \nthere is virtually no flow of traded goods, combined with lower border costs at points \nwith high trade flows, would be quite different at an aggregated level if compared to the \nconverse situation where border costs are high at points with large trade volume and low \nelsewhere. This is relevant given the relatively low share of GMS corridors in national \ntrade volumes.\nInternal trade is another issue relevant to corridor performance monitoring. Measuring \nperformance through border costs alone can miss out on an important role of the \ncorridor, even narrowly defined, in promoting economic growth. Imagine a corridor that \nis 60% within one country, with the remaining 40% divided into neighboring countries. \nTo focus only on cross-border trade activities, either bilateral or transit, implies ignoring \nthe relevance of much of the 60% that may be effectively catering to domestic trade and \ndevelopment.  In the extreme case, one can consider a case of extremely high border \ntrading costs that prevent almost any cross-border trade from occurring, but a hugely \ndynamic internal trade catering to domestic demand. Performance monitoring based on \nborder costs alone would provide a misleading assessment of the corridor. \nFinally, internal costs of transport may not necessarily be heavy on transaction costs \nat the borders, but more on the logistics costs (other than border costs).  So poorly ", "Regional Corridors Development in Regional Cooperation | 19\ndeveloped infrastructure, poor policies that allow monopolistic profits, corruption, and lax \nenforcement can lead to deterrence of total trade and poor corridor performance, even if \nborder costs are relatively low.\nThe TCD methodology for monitoring corridor performance avoids some of these \nproblems since it encompasses a view of the entire corridor. However, it is constrained by \nits narrow view of the corridor, which focuses on the time and resource costs of moving \ngoods between any two points with little to say about development of the corridor through \nits widening. Both border costs indicators and time/cost distance indicators are useful \nindicators, but only of Zone III corridor development. They need to be supplemented by \nZone I and II indicators, and also informed by the context of the corridors (as discussed \nin Section VA above).\nC.  Indicators for Monitoring GMS Corridors\nIt is evident from the discussion that indicators of trade facilitation in GMS may not be \nvery meaningful in a broad sense, given the relatively low trade weight of corridors in the \nGMS countries. Neither can the transport and trade facilitation indicators be considered \nas sufficient for monitoring corridor performance. At the same time, these indicators are \nclearly necessary inputs and can be relatively easily implemented. The approach adopted \nin CAREC, whereby partnership with freight and transporters\u2019 association is designed \nto collect such data, is a useful starting point, though needed capacity building may be \nsomewhat greater in the GMS context. The system to collect data should work with both \nnational and local carrier associations and logistics associations, using them to recruit \nsmall, medium, and large carriers and logistics operators.\nUse of time/cost distance methodology for indicators of transport and trade facilitation \nshould explicitly incorporate the quality of trade, particularly asymmetry in trade \nflows. Activities thus should be on a round-trip basis, to take into account the cost \nof empty repositioning (i.e., returning empty equipment home or moving a piece of \nempty equipment to another location where a load can then be secured). Similarly, \nquantification of exchange of traffic rights needs to look at both the utilization rate by \nrespective countries, as well as country benefits from the exchange (e.g., are vehicles \nusing exchange of traffic rights based in the country but owned by another country). \nThe measurements of time/distance costs should also address heterogeneity in trading \nenvironment by considering truckload, less than truckload, container load, and wagon \nload shipments. Attempts should be made to cover road, rail, water and road/water \nand road/rail movements of goods. This will also provide useful inputs ahead on issues \nrelated to interface between different modes.

Conclusions\nDevelopment of regional corridors is an essential component of the regional cooperation \ntoolkit. This paper elaborated on a framework for regional corridor development on the \nbasis of two essential aspects of these corridors, namely, the extent of their regionality \nand their area of influence or width. These two dimensions of regional corridors led to a \nframework identifying four zones of corridor development, along with associated interzone \nsequencing. \nThe framework was applied to the GMS program, with several implications emerging. A \nkey implication is that an advanced program like the GMS now needs to redefine regional \nprojects differently since the national/regional dichotomy is less relevant to the program. \nThe program needs to transition out of the first development zone into Zone II and Zone \nIII development. In particular, the program needs to balance its thrust into investment-light \nZone III, which is already under way, with a greater emphasis on investment-heavy Zone \nII. This may require developing a medium-term regional master plan. The plan can also \naddress the issue of defining regional projects for the GMS program by identifying an \nassociated pipeline of investment projects. \nThe framework developed in the paper is preliminary and can be extended and deepened \nin several ways. The formal analysis does not explicitly address the issues of additional \nnodes and congestion, nor does it incorporate benefits (of using corridors), which may \nmake it a richer optimizing framework. Another useful extension would be to look at links ", "Regional Corridors Development in Regional Cooperation | 21\nbetween Zone II and Zone III developments that benefit both types of development. \nEmpirical application of the framework to corridors, including implementing the corridor \nperformance indicators, is another area that will be useful in future work. A rich set of \nindicators can allow comparison of corridors and linkages to policies and stakeholder \nactions\u2014public and private\u2014to assess better interventions for development of the \nregional corridors.\nReferences\nADB, n.d.

The framework is subsequently applied to the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) regional cooperation program, yielding several implications for its future. The GMS program needs to redefine what constitutes a regional project and to formulate a regional master plan for further development of GMS regional corridors. The framework is also applied toward identifying an appropriate methodology for monitoring performance of regional corridors.", "Title": "Regional Corridors Development in Regional Cooperation (No. 258)", "Trapped": "False"}}
