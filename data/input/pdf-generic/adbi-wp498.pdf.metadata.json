INTRODUCTION \n\nAfter  a  decade  of  civil  conflict,  Nepal  is  going  through  a  transitional  phase  in  its  economic \ndevelopment.  Economic  growth  and  the  overall  macroeconomic  situation  have  improved \nsomewhat  during  the  post-conflict  period (that  is,  after  November  2006). This  is mainly  due  to \ntwo  factors:  the  rise  in  remittances  from  the  export  of  labor  services  and  the  improved \nperformance  of  the  agricultural  sector,  which  is  still  very  much  weather  driven.  This  paper \nmakes  the  case  for  a  connectivity-driven  development  strategy  for  Nepal. 1  It  argues  that \nimproved  connectivity  within  Nepal  and  Nepal\u2019s  cross-border  connectivity  with  its  neighbors  in \nSouth Asia, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina  (PRC)  that  are  converting  Nepal  from  a  landlocked  into  a  land-linked  state,  will  be \nimportant \u201cengines of growth\u201d for the country\u2019s economy. Such a development strategy in Nepal \nwould also lead to a win\u2013win situation for all countries in South Asia and East Asia. \n\nWhy do we need a connectivity-driven strategy for Nepal? National, sub-regional, and regional \ncontexts  need  to  be  considered.  First,  Nepal  is  a  landlocked  and  mountainous  country  and \ntherefore faces high trading costs. Improved connectivity within the country would reduce such \ncosts  and  promote  internal  trade,  investment,  and  economic  growth.  Second,  Nepal  is \nstrategically located between two dynamic \u201cgiant\u201d countries, the PRC and India, which rank first \nand  third,  respectively,  in  terms  of  Asia\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  (the  PRC  also  ranks \nsecond  in  terms  of  world  GDP,  behind  the  United  States).  Hence,  Nepal  has  the  potential  to \nbenefit greatly from regional cooperation and integration (RCI) for improving connectivity with its \nneighbors through transport, energy, and telecommunications projects. Connectivity-related RCI \nwith its neighbors could unlock the full development potential of Nepal by reducing trading costs \nand  by  helping  the  country  to  overcome  the  disadvantages  of  size\u2014a  small  population,  small \nmarkets,  and  an  inability  to take  advantage  of agglomeration  and  scale economies.  Ahmed et \nal. (2010) estimated that Nepal could double its GDP if it were to export hydro-based electricity \nto  India,  which  is  an  energy-thirsty  country.  A connectivity-driven  strategy  in  Nepal  would  also \nbenefit India and the PRC. Third, as argued in this paper, a connectivity-driven strategy is not a \nnew one for Nepal. In the past, Nepal was strategically located on the Southwestern Silk Road \n(SSR), which started in the PRC\u2019s Yunnan province, then passed through Myanmar to India and \nNepal,  and  looped  back  through  Tibet  to  Yunnan.  Nepal  was  an  entrep\u00f4t  for  trade  mainly \nbetween India and the PRC on the SSR. After a gap of about 5 centuries, the case for reviving \nthe  SSR  has  become  strong  and  Nepal  has  an  important  role  to  play.  A  connectivity-driven \nstrategy  for  Nepal,  together  with  the  ongoing  efforts  to  revive  the  SSR,  would  benefit  all \ncountries along the SSR. Economic integration in South Asia and broader pan-Asian integration \nwould also deepen (Rana and Chia 2014, forthcoming).  \n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the recent performance of the \nNepalese  economy.  Section  3  presents  indicators  of  infrastructure  development  in  Nepal  and \nhighlights the poor state and quality of physical connectivity in Nepal, which is among the worst \nin South Asia. Section 4 describes the strategic location of Nepal in Asia, and the historical role \nNepal  had  played  in  the  past  as  an  entrep\u00f4t  for  India\u2013PRC  trade  and  as  a  node  in  the  SSR. \nSection  5  argues  that  the  case  for  reviving  Nepal\u2019s  role  as  a  land-linked  state  has  increased \nsignificantly in recent years for a number of reasons. This section also proposes four conceptual \neconomic  corridors  for  the  purpose  and  makes  the  case  for  the  involvement  of  the  Asian \n\n                                                \n1 Such a development strategy could be feasible for a landlocked country facing high transport cost. It could also be \nfeasible for inland regions in a large continental country like the United States (in the 19th century) and presently \nthe PRC (Lee 2013). \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 498        \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n    \n\n              \n\nRana and Karmacharya \n\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  as  an  \u201chonest  broker\u201d  to  carry  forward  the  ideas  (as  in  other  sub-\nregional  schemes,  such  as  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  [GMS];  Brunei  Darussalam, \nIndonesia,  Malaysia,  Philippines\u2013East  Association  of  South  East  Asian  Nations  [ASEAN] \nGrowth Area [BIMP-EAGA]; and Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation [CAREC]). Such \na  role  would  lead  to  a  \u201cgarlanding\u201d  or  linking  of  sub-regional  cooperation  efforts  and  enhance \nADB\u2019s catalytic role in pan-Asian integration. Section 6 reviews Nepal\u2019s multi-track approach to \npromoting  RCI  in  connectivity\u2014national,  bilateral,  subregional,  interregional,  regional,  and \nmultilateral.  Section  7  highlights  the  recently  completed  and  ongoing  connectivity-related  RCI \nprojects  (cross-border  projects  as  well  as  national  projects  with  cross-border  implications)  in \nNepal and identifies the priority connectivity projects the country should consider in future under \nthe proposed connectivity-driven strategy. Section 8 summarizes and concludes.  \n\n2.  RECENT ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE \n\nSince  its  emergence  from  the  decade-long  civil  conflict  (from  1996  to  2006),  Nepal  has  been \ngoing  through  a  challenging  transitional  phase  in  its  development.  The  signing  of  a \nComprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in November 2006 resulted in a number of significant \nachievements,  such  as  participation  of  the  Maoist  party  in  mainstream  politics  and  relative \npeace,  the  election  of  the  Constituent  Assembly  in  2008,  and  the  decommissioning  of  the \nMaoist army. Unfortunately, however, the failure of the Constituent Assembly to meet the end-\nMay 2012 deadline to ratify a new constitution has proven to be a serious political setback for \nthe  country,  taking  a  heavy  toll  on  the  economy.  Following  the  expiry  of  the  Constituent \nAssembly\u2019s term in May 2012, a second Constituent Assembly was elected in November 2013.  \n\nThe data in Table 1 show that both the real sector and the current account balance have been \nfairly resilient in Nepal. While economic growth slowed to an average 4.12% per year during the \nconflict period (1996\u20132006), it recovered somewhat, to 4.52%, in the post-conflict period (2007\u2013\n2012). GDP per capita has shown an upward trend since the 1990s. Although export growth has \nslowed considerably, the current account balance as a share of GDP has been increasing. This \nhas been due mainly to rapid growth of remittances, which stood at around 21% of GDP during \nthe  post-conflict  period.  Needless  to  say,  Nepal\u2019s  economic  performance  would  have  been \nbetter had the constitution been ratified on time and had political stability been achieved. \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 498        \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n    \n\n              \n\nRana and Karmacharya \n\nTable 1: Key Macro-economic Indicators for Nepal  \n\n(annual averages) \n\n  \n\n  \n\nGDP Growth Rate (%) \n\nGDP per Capita ($) \n\n \nMerchandise Exports ($) Growth (%) \n\nMerchandise Imports ($) Growth (%) \n\nTrade Balance (% of GDP) \n\nCurrent Account Balance (% of GDP) \n\n \nRemittances (% of GDP)a \n\nGDP = gross domestic product; ( ) = negative values. \n\na Remittances also include pensions. \n\nPre-conflict \n\nConflict \n\nPost-conflict \n\n1990\u20131995 \n\n1996\u20132006 \n\n2007\u20132012 \n\n5.52 \n\n200.73 \n\n \n14.76 \n\n12.62 \n\n(14.70) \n\n(6.21) \n\n4.12 \n\n265.94 \n\n \n9.53 \n\n6.62 \n\n(16.63) \n\n(0.38) \n\n4.52 \n\n570.97 \n\n \n3.08 \n\n16.11 \n\n(21.84) \n\n1.44 \n\n \n1.80 \n\n \n8.32 \n\n \n20.96 \n\nSources:  Government  of  Nepal,  Economic  Survey  (various  issues);  Nepal  Rastra  Bank,  Quarterly  Economic  Bulletin \n(various issues); Central Bureau of Statistics, Population Census (1991, 2001, 2011). \n\nNepal shares a 1,800 km long porous border and 15 mutually agreed border points with India, \nso India is a \u201cnatural\u201d trading partner of Nepal. India provides a large market for Nepali goods \nand  services,  and  is  Nepal\u2019s  largest  trading  partner.  Nepal\u2019s  merchandise  trade  (exports  plus \nimports)  with  India,  rose from  9%  of  its total trade in  1990,  to  18%  in  1999,  and  53%  in  2012 \n(Figure 1).2 The PRC\u2019s overall share of Nepal\u2019s total trade also increased (from 6% in 1990 to \n13%  in  1999  to  30%  in  2012)  mainly  due  Nepal\u2019s  growing  imports  from  the  PRC  to  meet \ndomestic needs as well as re-exports to India. The PRC\u2019s share in Nepal\u2019s exports is very small \n(only about 3% in 2012), while India\u2019s share accounted for 60% in 2012. During the last decade \n(2002\u20132014),  Nepal\u2019s  external  trade  sector  has  seen  a  very  important  change.  Remittances \nfrom  labor  exports  have  increased  very  rapidly,  making  Nepal  one  of  the  most  remittance-\ndependent  countries  in  the  world.  From  an  estimated  $100  million  in  1996,  remittance  flows \nincreased to  $4.9  billion  in  2013 (a thirty-five-fold  increase).  As  a  share of GDP,  these figures \namounted  to  0.5%  and  25.5%,  respectively.  Remittances  from  labor  exports  are  the  single \nlargest  source  of  foreign  exchange  inflows.  While  India  has  been  a  traditional  destination  for \nNepalese  migrants,  an  increasingly  large  share  of  remittances  comes  from  other  countries, \nreflecting changing  migration  patterns,  in  part  due  to  higher  earnings  in  these new  destination \ncountries. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n2 This  figure  underestimates  the  value  of  actual  trade  with  India.  The  open  and  porous  border  between  the  two \ncountries  makes  it  hard  to  capture  the  level  of  informal  trade.  Survey  based  research  suggests  that  Nepalese \ninformal trade is 30%\u201340% of formal merchandise trade (Karmacharya et al. 2004).  \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 498        \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n    \n\n              \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRana and Karmacharya \n\nFigure 1: Nepal\u2014Direction of Exports in 1990, 1999, and 2012 \n\nFigure 1b: Nepal\u2014Direction of Imports in 1990, 1999, and 2012 \n\nFigure 1c: Nepal\u2014Direction of Total Trade in 1990, 1999, and 2012 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, US = United States. \n\nSource: Calcuated based on IMF, Direction of Trade Statistics (2013). \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 498 \n\n        \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n    \n\n             Rana and Karmacharya \n\n3.  INFRASTRUCUTRE DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS FOR \n\nNEPAL \n\nGiven  the  difficulties  associated  with  the  landlocked  nature  of  the  country  (Arvis  et  al.  2011), \nNepal  ranks  low  in  terms  of  infrastructure  development  indicators.  In  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Doing \nBusiness  Survey  2013,  Nepal  dropped  significantly  in  the  overall  \u201cease  of  doing  business\u201d \nrankings, falling from 55th position (out of 155 countries) in 2006 to 108th position (out of 185 \ncountries) (Table 2). This 2013 ranking is about the same as that for Pakistan (107th), but better \nthan that of India (132nd) and Bangladesh (125th) (Table 2). In terms of \u201ctrading across border\u201d \nindicators, Nepal ranked 171st, the lowest in South Asia. \n\nInter-country  comparisons  of  the quality  of  infrastructure  are  difficult  because  of  measurement \nproblems and the subjective nature of assessments. Those available from the World Economic \nForum\u2019s  Global  Competitiveness  Report  2013\u20132014  suggest  that  the  overall  quality  of \ninfrastructure  in  Nepal  was  among  the  worst  in  South  Asia  (Table  3).  With  a  score  of  2.9,  it \nranked  higher  only  than  Bangladesh  (2.8).  Nepal  scored  the  lowest  among  South  Asian \ncountries in terms of quality of roads, railroads, air transport, and supply of electricity. \n\nThe situation is similar in terms of indicators of information technology (IT) penetration. During \n2010\u20132011,  only  9%  of  the  population  in  Nepal  used  the  internet.  All  other  South  Asian \ncountries, except for Bangladesh (5%), had a higher share of internet users than Nepal (Table \n4).

NEPAL\u2019S STRATEGIC LOCATION AND ITS HISTORICAL \n\nROLE AS A LAND-LINKED STATE \n\nNepal  is  a  rectangular  shaped  country,  stretching  roughly  1,800  km  from  east  to  west  and  a \nquarter  of that from  north  to south,  sandwiched  between  the giant  economies  of the  PRC  and \nIndia.  Although  both  countries  are  experiencing  a  slowdown  in  their  economies,  the  PRC  and \nIndia are among the fastest growing countries in the world. Between them, the PRC and India \nhave around 2.5 billion people, accounting for approximately a third of the world population. \n\nNepal  is  a  landlocked  and  mountainous  country  and  has  high  trading  costs,  which  reduces \ncompetitiveness domestically and externally. Connectivity problems facing Nepal on its northern \nborder with the PRC are related to the Himalayan mountain range, which has eight out of the 10 \nhighest mountain peaks in the world. Nine points of connectivity with Tibet have been identified, \nof which only several are economically feasible at present. The one that is operational and used \nfor  trade  with  the  PRC  is  in  Kodari  along  the  Friendship  Road  connecting  Kathmandu  with \nLhasa  or  the  Kodari\u2013Barhabise\u2013Kathmandu\u2013Hetauda\u2013Birgunj  road.  However,  open  space  is \nlimited in this pass and it is not possible to set up a dry port to handle large volumes of traffic \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 498 \n\n        \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n    \n\n             Rana and Karmacharya \n\n(Pandey  2010).  Another  point  of  connectivity  that  has  recently  become  operational  since  the \ncompletion  of \nthe  Rasuwagarhi\u2013Syafrubeshi\u2013\nKathmandu\u2013Hetauda\u2013Birgunj  corridor.  This  new  corridor  has  greater  potential  and  there  are \nongoing efforts  to  build a  dry  port for  trade  with  the  PRC.  But  a  lot  still  remains to  be  done to \nmake it a proper transport corridor with modern highways and border points. \n\nthe  Rasuwagarhi\u2013Syaphrubeshi \n\nroad \n\nis \n\nThe  southern  border  of Nepal  with  India  is  essentially  porous,  with  large  amounts  of  unofficial \ntrade.  There  are  15  mutually  agreed  entry/exit  points,  seven  of  which  are  operational,  and  of \nwhich the most important are Birgunj and Bhairawa. Inland container depots (ICDs) have been \nbuilt  in  these  two  cities  and  in  Biratnagar.  The  closest  sea  port  for  Nepal\u2019s  foreign  trade  is \nKolkata port, which is 400 km away from Nepal\u2019s border. This port is very congested and roads \nleading  to  it  from  the  Nepalese  border  are  in  poor  condition.  Nepal  has  been  attempting  to \ndiversify its trade and use sea ports in Bangladesh, but there are sensitivities and transit issues \nwith India. \n\nFigure  2  highlights  the  strategic  location  of  Nepal.  Nepal  has  the  potential  to  be  a  land  link \nbetween India and other South Asian countries and the PRC. Nepal, together with Bangladesh, \nthe  northeastern  part  of  India,  and  the  PRC  can  also  be  a  land  link  between  Pakistan, \nAfghanistan, Central Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Rana (2013) has argued that in the \npast Nepal had indeed been an entrep\u00f4t for India\u2013PRC trade and a node on the historical SSR, \nwhich started in Yunnan (the southeastern province of the PRC), passing through Myanmar to \nIndia and Nepal, and looping back to Tibet and Yunnan.3 \n\nFigure 2: Strategic Location of Nepal \n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSource: Authors. \n \n\nThe entrep\u00f4t role of Nepal in trade between India and the PRC, however, declined significantly \nafter the late 18th century. Two explanations are given for this. Pandey (2010) argues that the \nBritish, who had colonized India at that time, diverted their trade and started selling opium to the \nPRC through the ports on the eastern coast of the PRC. This trade was very profitable for the \nBritish and their interest in the trade route through Nepal dwindled as a consequence. Another \n\n \n\n                                                \n3 See also Appendix 1. \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 498 \n\n        \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n    \n\n             Rana and Karmacharya \n\nexplanation is the discovery of a new trade route between India and Tibet in 1888 through the \nChumba Valley and the Nathu La pass closer to Lhasa.  \n\nEver since, Nepal has seen the Himalayas as a barrier and focused on greater trade with India \n(Pandey  2010).  The  recent  policies  of  pro-Indian  parties  in  Nepal  have  further  deepened  this \ntrend. Thus Nepal has become overly dependent on the congested Kolkata port for its external \ntrade. The  Chinese,  on  the  other  hand,  have  continued  to  use  Nepal to trade  with  India.  PRC \ngoods  enter  Nepal  through  the  Khasa  point  on  the  Kodari  highway  and  are  taken  to  northern \nIndian cities, either through Kathmandu or directly to the border towns in Nepal\u2019s Terai. \n\n5.  THE CASE FOR REVIVING NEPAL\u2019S ROLE AS A LAND-\n\nLINKED STATE \n\nAlthough  sea  transport  is  expected  to  be  the  dominant  form  of  connectivity  in  the  foreseeable \nfuture, the case for reviving Nepal\u2019s role as a land-linked state in Asia has strengthened greatly \nin recent years. This is for a number of reasons: \n\n(i)  Maritime Asia, defined as the dynamic north\u2013south coastal region from the Republic of \nKorea to Indonesia, is starting to become increasingly continental-based, with expanding \nnetworks  of  roads,  railways,  and  pipelines.  The  trend  toward  the  evolution  of  a \ncontinental-based  Asia  is  mainly  a  result  of  the  PRC\u2019s  \u201cWestern  Development\u201d  plan  or \nthe \u201cGo West\u201d policy being implemented since 2000. The main components of this policy \nwere  the  construction  of  infrastructure  (mainly  transport,  but  also  power  plants), \nattracting foreign direct investment (FDI) to the inner provinces, and the development of \nhuman  resources  (health  and  education)  in  the  inner  provinces.  A  number  of \nexpressways  have  been  constructed from  the  coastal  cities  of  Shanghai and  Beijing  to \nthe  inner  provinces  (Figure  2  in  Rana  and  Chia  [2014]).  These  include  the  Shanghai\u2013\nXi\u2019an,  Shanghai\u2013Chongqing\u2013Kunming,  Shanghai\u2013Kunming,  and  Beijing\u2013Lhasa \nexpressways.4  \n\nFigure  3  in  Rana  and  Chia  (2014)  shows  the  key  existing  and  proposed  railways  and \npipelines  in  the  PRC.  In  addition  to  east  to  west  railways,  several  north\u2013south \nconnectivity projects have either been completed (such as the Sino\u2013Myanmar pipeline) \nor planned (such as the Pakistan\u2013PRC rail and road link project across the Karokoram \nmountain  ranges,  and  the  Yunnan\u2013Lao  PDR\u2013Thailand  Railway).  Railway  connectivity \nwith Europe and oil pipelines connecting the PRC with the Central Asian Republics have \nalso been established.  \n\nLhasa  is  emerging  as  a  major  transportation  hub  in  the  western  part  of  the  PRC.  Five \nmajor  highways  converge  in  Lhasa:  the  Kunming\u2013Lhasa,  Shanghai\u2013Chengdu\u2013Lhasa, \nBeijing\u2013Lhasa,  and  Yecheng\u2013Lhasa  expressways,  and  the  Friendship  Highway  that \nconnects  Kathmandu  (Nepal)  with  Lhasa.  Also,  the  Beijing\u2013Tibet  Railway  will  reach \nXigaste in late 2014 and is to be extended soon to reach the border with Nepal. Mainly \nbecause of these massive efforts to build infrastructure, cities in inner provinces, such as \nKunming, Chongqing, Chengdu, Xi\u2019an, and Xining have emerged as major metropolitan \n\n                                                \n4 The PRC\u2019s highways have grown rapidly in total length, from 271 km in 1990 to 85,000 km in 2011, making it the \nworld\u2019s  largest  national  freeway  system.  The  United  States  Interstate  Highway  system\u2014started  in  1956  and \nconsidered complete in 1991\u2014totals 75,932 km and is not expected to grow much. The PRC, on the other hand, \nwill  expand  its  expressway  system  and  is  intent  on  connecting  all  provincial  capitals  and  cities  with  populations \nover 200,000. The new highways and the economic growth they will drive will help close the gap with the United \nStates (Lee 2013).  \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 498 \n\n        \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n    \n\n             Rana and Karmacharya \n\ncities with urban infrastructure projects rivaling some of those in the coastal areas. Nepal \ncould benefit from joining this trend. \n\n(ii)  Increasing  connectivity  within  India  and  ongoing  efforts  to  promote  ASEAN\u2013India \nconnectivity  have  also  strengthened  the  case  for  Nepal  to  improve  connectivity  with \nneighboring  countries.  In  India,  the  Golden  Quadrilateral  Project,  which  improves \nconnectivity between the four major nodal cities in the country\u2014Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, \nand  Kolkata\u2014has  been  completed.  As  a  component  of  its  \u201cLook  East\u201d  policy,  India  is \nactively promoting connectivity with Southeast Asia. More recently, further to the request \nof  the  East  Asia  Summit  (EAS),  the  Economic  Research  Institute  for  ASEAN  and  East \nAsia (ERIA) has come up with two projects for ASEAN\u2013India connectivity: the Mekong\u2013\nIndia  Economic  Corridor  (MIEC)  and  the  Trilateral  Highway  connecting  India  and \nMyanmar with Thailand (Figure 4 in Rana and Chia 2014). While the first project focuses \non  connecting  production  blocks  and  supply  chains  in  Southeast  Asia  with  those  in \nIndia\u2014especially the automotive industry in Bangkok\u2014with those in Chennai (India) by \nsea and land, the second project focuses on the development of the North East Region \nof  India.  One  major  project  in  the  MIEC  is  the  $8.6  billion  Dawei  deep-sea  port  and \nindustrial estate in Myanmar. ADB is the implementing body for the MIEC and it stands \nready  to  bring  together  the  stakeholders  and  provide  technical  assistance  and  co-\nfinancing. This  role  is  similar to the  one  ADB  played  in  the Greater  Mekong  Subregion \n(GMS)  and  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  sub-regional \ncooperation efforts. \n\n(iii) The  encouraging  but  gradual  political  and  economic  reforms  in  Myanmar,  a  node \nbetween South Asia and East Asia, has also provided a fillip for improving connectivity \nbetween South Asia and East Asia. Both the PRC and India are actively involved. PRC \nstrategists  have  written  about  the  \u201cMalacca  Dilemma,\u201d  with  the  Straits  being  a  natural \nchoke  point,  and  the  need  to  find  an  alternative  route. 5 The  1,100  km  gas  pipeline \ncomponent of the Sino\u2013Myanmar pipelines project from Kyaukphyu, a port in Myanmar, \nto  Kunming  became  operational  earlier  this  year.  Next  year,  an  oil  pipeline  that  is \nexpected to meet about 10% of the PRC\u2019s oil import demand will open along the same \nroute.  Road  and  railway  are  to  follow  suit.  Work  on  the  Kaladan  Multimodal  Project, \nseeking  to  connect  Kolkata  in  India  with  Sittwe  in  Myanmar  by  sea  and  then  the  north \neast region of India by river and road transport, is ongoing. \n\n(iv) To realize the potential of dynamic complementarities associated with the newer theories \nof  trade  pioneered  by  Jones  and  Kierzkowski  (1990),  connectivity  between  South  Asia \nand  East  Asia  needs  to  be  strengthened,  and  Nepal  has  a  role  to  play.  The  traditional \ntheory  of  comparative  advantage  proscribes  that  developing  countries  produce  labor- \nintensive  goods  which  they  exchange  for  relatively  capital-  and  skill-intensive  goods \nproduced by more advanced countries. All separate tasks involved in producing a good, \nhowever, are carried out entirely in one country. Under the newer theories, production is \nspliced and diced into separate fragments and production of parts and components are \nlocated in production blocks around the world, which are linked by efficient service links. \nThe  type  of  service  link  required  depends  on  the  sector  being  considered.  While  for \nbulky items sea freight is still the most cost-effective way of moving goods, for less bulky \nand  high  value-added  parts  and  components,  road  transportation  could  be  more  cost-\neffective, especially between neighboring countries. \n\n                                                \n5 Roughly 80% of the PRC\u2019s crude oil imports pass through the Straits. The other strategic projects for the PRC\u2019s oil \nimports  are:  (i)  the  proposed  PRC\u2013Pakistan  Economic  Corridor  passing  through  some  of  the  highest  and  most \nlandslide-prone  mountains  (Figure  3B);  (ii)  the  proposed  Kunming\u2013Lao  PDR\u2013Thailand  Railway  (Figure  3b);  and \n(iii) pipelines with Central Asian countries and the Russian Federation.  \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 498 \n\n        \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n    \n\n             Rana and Karmacharya \n\n(v)  A  final  reason  for  reviving  Nepal  as  a  land-linked  state  is  that  the  distances  between \nIndian  cities  and  the  inner  cities  of the  PRC would  be greatly  reduced  if  the  land  route \nthrough  Nepal  were  used  (Table  6).  For  example,  the  distance  from  New  Delhi,  where \nthe Delhi\u2013Mumbai Industrial Corridor starts, to Kunming via Hong Kong, China is about \n10,345  km,  whereas  through  Nepal  it  would  be  only  about  a  quarter  of  that  distance. \nSimilarly, the distance from Chennai to Kunming through Hong Kong, China is 6,841 km \ncompared with 3,540 km through Nepal. Besides, using Nepal as a land link would result \nin  an  additional  cost  saving  as there  would  be  no  need  to transship goods  in  the  PRC \nports from  ships to trucks  to ferry  them to  the  PRC\u2019s  inner  cities.  Finally, the  Nathu  La \nPass, the height of which is around 4,300 meters (14,000 feet above sea level), is higher \nthan the passes in Nepal (Zhangmu and Kyirong near Syaphrubeshi) (Table 7). Hence, \nfor  much  of  the  year  the  Nathu  La  pass  is  covered  by  ice  and  the  value  of  trade  that \npasses through it averages only about US $100,000 per annum. \n\nTable 6: Distance Between Indian Cities and Inner Cities of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina \n\n(km) \n\nTo \n\nFrom \n\nVia Sea and Land Route \n(through Hong Kong, China) \n\nVia Land Route  \n(through Nepal) \n\nKunming  Chongqing  Chengdu  Kunming  Chongqing  Chengdu \n\n \nNew Delhi \nChennai \nNote: Sea distances are actual; land distances are based on the straight-line method. \n\n10,669 \n6,745 \n\n10,437 \n7,004 \n\n10,345 \n6,841 \n\n2,887 \n3,540 \n\n3,151 \n3,804 \n\n2,911 \n3,564 \n\nSources: www.searates.com and www.freemaptools.com. \n\nTable 7: Height above Sea Level \n\n \n\nZhangmu (near Kodari) \n\nKyirong (near Syaprubeshi) \n\nLhasa \n\nNathu La Pass \n\nSource: Google Map Find Altitude. \n\nMeters \n\n2,300 \n\n2,600 \n\n3,657 \n\n4,297 \n\nFeet \n\n7,544 \n\n8,500 \n\n11,997 \n\n14,097 \n\nAs part of the revival of the Southwestern Silk Road, Rana and Chia (2014) have proposed four \nconceptual  multimodal  economic  corridors:  (i)  Kolkata\u2013Kathmandu\u2013Lhasa\u2013Kunming\u2013ASEAN; \n(iii)  New  Delhi\u2013\n(ii)  Kolkata\u2013Kathmandu\u2013Lhasa\u2013Pakistan\u2013Afghanistan\u2013Central  Asia; \nKathmandu\u2013Lhasa-Kunming\u2013ASEAN  (linking  up  with  the  Delhi\u2013Mumbai  Industrial  Corridor); \nand (iv) New Delhi\u2013Kathmandu\u2013Lhasa\u2013Pakistan\u2013Afghanistan\u2013Central Asia (Figure 3).6 \n\nLohani (2005) and Pandey (2010) have made the case for a trans-Himalayan railway. While rail \ntransport  has  a  potential  advantage  over  roads  because  of  higher  speed,  shorter  border \ncrossings,  and  fewer  en  route  delays,  the  extent  to  which  this  potential  can  be  realized  is \nsubject to debate (Arvis, Raballand, and Martheu 2011). Hence, the corridors proposed in this \nstudy are multimodal, both railways and roads, pending further analysis of feasibility. \n\n                                                \n6 These  corridors  are  consistent  with  the  corridors  identified  in  the  ADB\u2013South  Asian  Association  for  Regional \n\nCooperation (SAARC) Regional Multimodal Transport Study. \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 498 \n\n        \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n    \n\n             Rana and Karmacharya \n\nFigure 3: Proposed Conceptual Multimodal Corridors in South Asia \n\n \n\nASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\nSource: Rana and Chia (2014). \n\nTransport  corridors  foster  linkages  between  major  urban  centers  and  their  relatively  backward \nhinterlands.  They  generate  the  potential  for  development  along  the  corridor  and  for  exploiting \neconomies  of  scale,  and  provide  opportunities  for  industrial  agglomeration  along  the  corridor. \nThey  also  provide  an  opportunity  for  complementary  specialization  to  be  exploited  within  a \ngeographic  region  and  to  link  remote  regions  to  global  supply  chains.  Sometimes,  trade \ncorridors or roads by themselves can also have negative impacts (Box 1). For this potential to \nbe  realized,  however,  transport  corridors  have  to  be  transformed  into  full-fledged  economic \ncorridors,  where  stakeholders  are  fully  involved  in  coming  up  with  initiatives  to  promote \neconomic growth and poverty reduction. This has been the experience of the GMS and CAREC \nregions (Box 2). \n\nHowever,  Nepal  is  only  one  of  the  countries  involved  in  the  proposed  economic  corridors. \nActions  are  required  in  the  PRC  as  well  as  India.  Just  as  in  the  GMS,  CAREC,  South  Asian \nSubregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC), and more recently in the MIEC, ADB will have to \nplay  an  important  role  as  a  \u201cfacilitator,  financier,  honest  broker,  and  technical  advisor\u201d.  The \ndifference in size, institutional capacity, and the distribution of the benefits and costs among the \nthree countries involved in the proposed India\u2013Nepal\u2013PRC economic corridor will make ADB a \nwelcome balancing force and honest broker. \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 498 \n\n        \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n    \n\n             Rana and Karmacharya \n\n \n\nBox 1: Connectivity in the GMS and Impacts on the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic \n\nNot so long ago, references to economic development in Lao PDR typically mentioned \nthe disadvantages of being a country that is landlocked. Lao PDR was viewed as fated \nto grow less rapidly than its neighbors. But now, with the GMS corridors, Lao PDR finds \nitself as the pivot point between ASEAN\u2019s 600 million people with $2 trillion in GDP, and \nthe PRC\u2019s population of 1.3 billion and its $7 trillion economy. \n\nBut not all of the impacts of connectivity are positive. If Lao PDR ends up serving only \nas  a  \u201cchute\u201d  for  goods  and  passengers  speeding  between  its  richer  neighbors,  the \ncountry  could  find  itself  lagging  even  further  behind  the  region\u2019s  fast  development. \n(Human trafficking would also increase.) The Lao PDR trucking industry, for example, is \nsuffering because of a recent agreement under which pre-inspected fruits from Thailand \ncan  be  transported  cross-border  to  the  PRC  uninterruptedly,  without  being  loaded  into \nLao PDR trucks. \n\nFortunately,  Lao  PDR  has  plenty  to  offer,  in  regional  commerce  and  supply  chains  as \nwell  as  in  tourism.  With  wages  rising  sharply  in  the  PRC  and  other  Southeast  Asian \ncountries, Lao PDR has been able to attract FDI in food processing, wood furniture, and \nthe apparel industry, and is able to sell finished products to neighboring countries using \nthe  new  transport  infrastructure.  It  has  also  developed  two  special  economic  zones \n(SEZs) situated near routes connecting Thailand to the PRC and Thailand to Viet Nam. \nThese  SEZs  have  attracted  FDI  to  make  products  such  as  electrical  wire,  processed \nfoods, wood products, textiles, shoes, and handbags for export to neighboring countries. \nToyota is planning to locate in one of the SEZs to make interior components, including \nvehicle seat covers, to supply assembly plants in Thailand. \n\nImproved  connectivity  has  enabled  Lao  PDR  to  attract  more  tourists  to  its  world-class \nsites. Data show that most international visitors to the Indochina region now include Lao \nPDR in their itineraries. Data also show that more European tourists choose to enter Lao \nPDR via the bridge in Vientiane than through the Vientiane International Airport. \n\nSource: Bangkok Post, 1 July 2013. \n\n \n\n \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 498 \n\n        \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n    \n\n             Rana and Karmacharya \n\nBox 2: GMS and CAREC Corridors, and the MIEC: the Role of ADB \n\nThe  corridor  approach  to  subregional  development  was  adopted  by  ADB  in  1992  in  the  Greater \nMekong  subregion  comprising  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  Myanmar,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam  plus  the \nPRC\u2019s  Yunnan  Province  and  the  Guangxi  Autonomous  Region.  The  GMS  corridor  system \ncomprises three main corridors involving multiple routes: the North\u2013South Economic Corridor, the \nEast\u2013West Economic Corridor, and the Southern Economic Corridor. These corridors are oriented \ntowards  seaports  and  provide  valuable  access  to  world  markets  for  landlocked  Lao  PDR  and \nYunnan  province  of  the  PRC.  Of  the  three  corridors,  the  North\u2013South  Economic  Corridor  is  the \nmost advanced. \n\nInitially,  these  corridors  were  transport  corridors,  but  since  2008  efforts  have  been  made  to \ndevelop institutions to transform these corridors into full-fledged economic corridors. An Economic \nCorridors Forum (ECF) has been established to bring together the various stakeholders in corridor \ndevelopment\u2014national  governments,  local  governments,  the  business  community,  and  civil \nsociety\u2014to  network,  exchange  views,  recommend  initiatives  for  economic  development,  and \npromote corridor activity.  \n\nADB has taken on the role of secretariat as well as \u201croles of the facilitator, financier, honest broker, \nand technical advisor.\u201d \n\nThe  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Program  is  a  partnership  of  10 \ncountries in Central Asia, several of which are landlocked, supported by six multilateral institutions \nwith  ADB  as  the  secretariat.  CAREC  has  identified  six  multimodal  transport  corridors  that  run \neast\u2013west  from  the  north  of  the  PRC  to  Azerbaijan  in  the  Caucasus,  and  north\u2013south  from  the \nborder  of  Kazakhstan  to  Pakistan.  Nearly  50%  of  the  corridors  have  been  built  or  rehabilitated, \ncovering  almost  4,000  km  of  roads  and  3,500  km  of  railways.  There  are  plans  to  convert  these \ntransport corridors into economic corridors. \n\nSources: Weimer (2009), ADB (2012). \n\n \n\n6.  NEPAL\u2019S REGIONAL COOPERATION AND INTEGRATION \n\nPOLICIES \n\nNepal has adopted a multi-track approach to fostering RCI in connectivity with its neighbors and \nthe  rest  of  the  world,  comprising  actions  at  the  national,  bilateral,  subregional,  regional,  inter-\nregional, and multilateral levels. \n\n6.1  National Policies \n\nSince it embarked on the periodic development planning exercise in 1956, Nepal has conducted \nan interventionist, protectionist, state-led policy, which has resulted in a large public sector, the \ndominance of state corporations, and a relatively closed economy. The serious macroeconomic \nimbalances  and  widening  current  account  deficit  in  the  mid-1980s  led  Nepal  to  start \nimplementing  economic  policy  reforms  to  facilitate  its  integration  with  rest  of  the  world  by \nopening  up  its  economy  to  trade  in  goods  and  services,  technology,  and  investment.  The \neconomic  reform  process  was  further  intensified  in  1992,  when  the  newly  elected  democratic \ngovernment brought about a sea change in economic and trade policies. The new government \ntried to inject new life into the economy by adopting a range of liberal and private sector-friendly \npolicies; enacting new rules and regulations and establishing new institutions; privatizing public \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 498 \n\n        \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n    \n\n             Rana and Karmacharya \n\nenterprises;  and  giving  greater  importance  to  the  private  sector  in  the  economy.  In  the  most \nrecent round of reforms, the government has improved tax administration, introduced a medium-\nterm expenditure framework, and started a reform of the financial sector.  \n\na) Trade and Industrial Policies \n\nEconomic policy reforms since early 1990s have substantially reduced the level and variations \nin nominal tariff rates in Nepal. The average applied Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariff rate had \nfallen to 12.1% by 2012, down from 39.8% in 1991 (Table 8). The tariff structure has also been \nstreamlined:  the  highest  level  of  tariff  had  been  reduced  from  245%  in  1991  to  80%  in  2012, \nmostly applicable to motor vehicles.  \n\nTable 8: Nepal\u2019s Average MFN Tariff Rate for Selected Years \n\n \nAverage tariff rates (simple applied) \nMaximum tariff rate \nNumber of tariff bands \n\nMFN = Most Favored Nation. \n\n1991 \n39.8 \n245 \n7 \n\n2001 \n14.4 \n80 \n\n \n\n2012 \n12.2 \n80 \n6 \n\nSources: Government of Nepal, Economic Surveys: Trade Policy Review, Nepal; World Trade Organization (WTO) 2011: \nWorld Trade Indicators; World Bank. \n\nRecognizing the vital role of trade in the growth and transformation of its economy, Nepal has \nundertaken several major reviews of its trade policy. In 2009 it issued its first new trade policy \nsince  its  accession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  in  2004,  fully  consistent  with  the \nprinciples  of  the  WTO  and  adhering  to  the  principles  of  a  liberal,  open,  and  transparent \neconomic system. This new policy contained a variety of export promotion and trade facilitation \nmeasures to enhance Nepal\u2019s competitiveness. In 2010, Nepal came up with the Nepal Trade \nIntegration  Strategy  (NTIS)  to  enhance  the  competitiveness  of  its  exports  and  seek \nopportunities abroad. This strategy seeks to improve market access and build domestic support \ninstitutions  for  exporters,  and  enhance  the  government\u2019s  capacity  to  coordinate  trade-related \ninstitutions and development partners. \n\nInitiatives have been taken to establish integrated checkpoints at five major customs facilities in \nthe border areas and priority has been given to establish dry ports at all major customs points. \nEfforts  have  also  been  initiated  to  establish  Special  Economic  Zones  in  major  business  hubs. \nThe  government  has  drafted  a  Special  Economic  Zone  Bill  and  submitted  it  for  parliamentary \napproval.  \n\nb) Customs Reform and Modernization Policies  \n\nIn  recent  years,  there  have  been  a  number  of  efforts  to  modernize  the  customs  system  to \nreduce  costs  and  clearance  times.  Customs  authorities  have  recently  finalized  their  latest \nCustoms Reform and Modernization Plan (2013\u20132017). This 4-year plan contains a number of \nmeasures in relation to: (i) simplification of procedures; (ii) establishment of client service desks \nat  border  offices;  (ii)  improvement  of  cargo  selectivity,  based  on  better  risk  management \nprofiling;  (iv)  more  effective  use  of  post  clearance  audits;  (v)  Memorandums  of  Understanding \nwith  the  trading  community;  (vi)  an  improved  valuation  data  base  access;  and  (vii)  zero \ntolerance of incorrect declarations. \n\nA  major  development  has  been  the  introduction  and  expansion  of  the  Automated  System  for \nCustoms Data (ASYCUDA), which is now available at 15 customs posts. The government has \nbeen  planning  to  eventually  launch  a  web-based  clearance  system.  It  is  also  planning  to \nestablish a national single window to streamline trade procedures and reduce transaction costs \nfor doing business across the border. \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 498 \n\n        \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n    \n\n             Rana and Karmacharya \n\nc) Transport Sector Policies  \n\nThe  transport  sector  in  Nepal  continues  to  be  governed  by  the  following  policies:  the  National \nTransport  Policy  (2001),  the  20-year  Strategic  Road  Network  Master  Plan,  the  Priority \nInvestment  Plan  (PIP)  2007\u20132016,  and  the  Local  Infrastructure  Development  Policy  (2004). \nThese policies recognize the need to connect the whole country and develop and extend a road \nnetwork  that  brings  all  people  within  reach  of  an  all-season  road  within  four  hours  walk  in  the \nhills  and  mountains  and  two  hours  walk  in  the  Terai.  Air  transport  is  focused  mainly  on \npromoting  tourism  and  access  to  remote  mountain  districts,  where  road  transport  will  not  be \neconomically viable. \n\nIn the road subsector, substantial efforts are being made through partnerships with the donors \nto  help  the  Department  of  Roads  improve  its  road  management  capacity,  planning  and \nmonitoring capability, environmental and traffic safety practices, and control of overloading.  \n\nd) Energy Sector Policies  \n\nThe government\u2019s  policy  initiatives  in  the  energy  sector  include the  Electricity  Act  1992,  which \nwas designed to develop and manage the hydropower regime in Nepal and to standardize and \nsafeguard electricity services. It dealt with issues such as licensing, royalties, duties and taxes, \ntariff  fixation,  and  land  acquisition.  This  was  followed  by  the  Hydropower  Development  Policy \nNepal  (2001),  which  listed  objectives  and  rules  to  govern  the  hydropower  sector,  including \nspecific  functions  relating  to  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution,  and  the  creation  of  an \nindependent power systems operator.  Recently, draft versions of the Nepal Electricity Act and \nthe  Nepal  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  Act  have  been  approved  by  the  Cabinet  and \nsubmitted  to  Parliament  in  2013:  the  former  is  to  restructure  Nepal  Electricity  Authority  (NEA) \nthrough  unbundling  of  its  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  operations;  the  latter  is  to \nset up an independent regulatory regime for the power sector, which has long been considered \nnecessary to attract investment into the sector. Other government initiatives include the National \nWater  Resource  Strategy  2002,  which  contains  policy  directives  such  as  (i)  NEA  to  become \ncommercially viable through corporatization, improved management, and separation of its rural \nelectrification  operations;  (ii)  NEA  to  be  unbundled  by  separately  creating  a  transmission/load \ndispatch center; and (iii) generation to become the responsibility of a separate corporation. With \na declared state of energy crisis, the National Electricity Crisis Resolution Action Plan 2008 was \napproved  by  the  cabinet  with  various  action  points,  ranging  from  immediate  to  long-term \nstrategies, to deal with the worsening situation. These included increasing power imports from \nIndia,  construction  of  thermal  power  plants,  expanding  transmission  capacity,  and  curbing \nelectricity theft. In December 2006, the government set up a task force to prepare a road map \nfor a hydropower development plan in Nepal, with the objective of generating 10,000 MW in 10 \nyears.  \n\ne) Infrastructure Financing Policies  \n\nNepal  has  recently  recognized  the  need  to  engage  the  private  sector  in  infrastructure \ndevelopment.  The  priorities  are  the  construction  of  new  road  networks,  generation  of \nhydroelectricity,  railways,  and  airports.  It  established  the  Nepal  Investment  Board  to  focus  on \nmobilization  of  investment  for  mega  infrastructure  projects  under  public\u2013private  partnerships \n(PPP)  and  other  suitable  funding  mechanisms.  It  introduced  the  Build,  Own,  Operate,  and \nTransfer (BOOT) Act 2006, the Banks and Financial Institutions Act, and the Private Financing \nin Build and Operation of Infrastructures Act 2063 BS (2006).  \n\nRecently, Kathmandu\u2013Kulekhani\u2013Hetauda tunnel (58 km) project received the permission from \nthe  government  to  be  developed  under  the  BOOT  system.  Some  of  the  other  projects  under \nconsideration  for  private  participation  include  a  \u201cfast-track\u201d  north\u2013south  corridor  linking \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 498 \n\n        \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n    \n\n             Rana and Karmacharya \n\nKathmandu with Terai, an east\u2013west rail corridor in Terai, and two north\u2013south corridors linking \nthe PRC with India. \n\nNumerous studies have indicated that the prolonged political instability that has weakened the \ncountry\u2019s  governance  has  been  a  critical  constraint  on  private  sector  investment.7 The  political \nuncertainties following  the  dissolution  of  the  country\u2019s  constituent assembly  in  May  2012  have \ndisrupted  the  formulation  and  implementation  of  policies  conducive  to  private  investment.  Of \nparticular importance is the delay in amending the Private Financing in Build and Operation of \nInfrastructures  Act\u2014popularly  known  as  the  BOOT  act\u2014which  governs  PPP  investments  and \ncurrently lacks clarity. For example, the government\u2019s ability under the act in its current form to \ncancel  concession  agreements  without  effective  compensation  for  the  concessionaire  in  FDI \nand  BOOT  projects  heightens  the  risk  profile  in  the  view  of  private  investors  and  discourages \nthem  from  investing  in  Nepal.  Moreover,  the  limited  capacity  of  the  bureaucracy  and  its  weak \ngovernance  has  meant  that  a  comprehensive  strategy  to  deal  with  the  exigencies  of  private \nsector  development  (PSD)  is  lacking.  Among  other  obstacles  to  business,  the  private  sector \nmust  deal  with  slow  bureaucratic  procedures,  weak  enforcement  of  contracts,  a  cumbersome \ntax regime, and inconsistent policies. In 2010, the government set up the Nepal Business Forum \nto address these issues; facilitate a national platform for public\u2013private dialogues; and establish \na structured, transparent, and results-oriented mechanism through which the public and private \nsector can collaborate to find solutions.  \n\n6.2  Bilateral Cooperation and Integration Policies \n\n Nepal has also attempted to improve cooperation with its neighboring countries. \n\na) Nepal\u2013India Cooperation \n\nThe  governments  of  Nepal  and  India  have  a  long  history  of  cooperation  on  trade  and  transit. \nThe  treaties  governing  bilateral  trade  and  transit  between  the  two  countries  include:  (i)  the \nTreaty of Trade, (ii) the Treaty of Transit, and (iii) the Railway Service Agreement. \n\nThe  Treaty  of  Transit,  which  was  renewed  in  March  2006  and  again  in  2013,  confirms  transit \nrights  through  each  other\u2019s  territory  through  mutually  agreed  routes  and  modalities,  restricting \nNepalese  traders  to  the  use  of  only  the  port,  at  Kolkata\u2013Haldia.  India  allows  Nepali  trucks  to \noperate on designated routes. Indian trucks can go anywhere in Nepal as long as they return to \nIndia  within  72  hours.  Goods  can  move  by  road  or  rail  through  the  two  countries.  The  Inland \n\n                                                \n7  World  Economic  Forum  (2013);  ADB,  Department  for  International  Development,  and  International  Labour \n\nOrganization (2009).  \n\n \n\n19 \n \n\n(non-reciprocal)  preferential \n\nThe  Treaty  of  Trade  was  renewed  in  October  2009  for  7  years.  Under  this  treaty,  India  and \nNepal  accord  each  other  unconditional  MFN  treatment;  they  also  exempt  imports  of  certain \nprimary  products  from  customs  duties  and  quantitative  restrictions  on  a  reciprocal  basis;  and \nindustrial  products \nIndia  grants \nmanufactured in Nepal to promote the industrial development of Nepal. The renewed treaty has: \n(i) expanded the list of primary products with duty free access to India; (ii) agreed to recognize \nthe  sanitary  and  phyto-sanitary  certificates  issued  by  the  competent  authority  of  the  exporting \ncountry  if  that  authority  is  internationally  accredited;  (iii)  adopted  a  joint  mechanism  for \nclearance  of  perishable  goods;  (iv)  established  an  Inter-Governmental  Sub-Committee  at  the \njoint-secretary level in addition to an Inter-Governmental Committee; and (v) agreed to capacity \nbuilding  for  Nepal  on  technical  standards,  quarantine  and  testing  facilities,  and  human \nresources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n\nto  almost  all \n\ntreatment \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 498 \n\n        \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n    \n\n             Rana and Karmacharya \n\nClearance/Container Depot (ICD) in Birgunj and the extension of the railway line from Raxaul to \nBirgunj has facilitated the direct movement of goods by rail between the two countries. \n\nAs  part  of  a  2012  review  of  the  Rail  Services  Agreement,  India  agreed  to  the  movement  of \ncontainerized  railway  cargo  between  all  ICDs  and  Integrated  Check  Posts  (ICPs)  between \nNepal  and  India  through  which  Nepal  is  authorized  to  carry  out  third  country  trade.  However, \nbreak bulk and open wagons are still not permitted, restricting the types of products Nepal can \ntrade internationally. \n\nNepal and India have also signed an Agreement of Cooperation to Control Unauthorized Trade \nbetween India and Nepal, a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement, Bilateral Investment \nPromotion and Protection Agreement (BIPPA), and Air Service Agreement. Moreover, the two \ncountries have signed a bilateral agreement to exchange power to address the seasonal \ndisparity of demand and supply of electricity in both countries.  \n \nb) Nepal\u2013Bangladesh Cooperation \n\nIn 1976, Nepal and Bangladesh signed a bilateral agreement on transit under which traffic-in-\ntransit was made exempt from customs duty and from all transit duties or other charges (except \nreasonable charges for transportation). It provides six points of entry and exit for the movement \nof traffic-in-transit through Bangladesh ports and border crossings\u2014Mongla Port, Chittagong \nPort, Birol, Banglabandha, Chilahati, and Benapole. However, the agreement is bilateral rather \nthan tripartite and Nepal still needs Indian consent to reach Bangladesh through India. It may be \nthat this agreement is largely symbolic, as this is not considered to be a commercially viable \ntransit route. Furthermore, rail connection between Nepal and Bangladesh is also possible on \nthe Rohanpur\u2013Singhabad sector. The necessary studies on the feasibility of this route have \nbeen conducted, but the government has yet to make the necessary arrangements and \namendments to make the route fully operational.  \n\nc) Nepal\u2013PRC Cooperation \n\nNepal and the PRC have concluded a number of trade and trade-related treaties. These include \nthe  Trade  and  Payment  Agreements  1981,  the  Agreement  with  Tibet  Autonomous  Region \n(TAR) of the PRC on Trade and Other Related Matters 2002, the Bilateral Road Transportation \nAgreement 1994, the Agreement of Cooperation for Industrial Product Inspection 2005, and the \nAir Services Agreement 2003. Moreover, a Memorandum of Understanding between Nepal and \nTAR  of  the  PRC  to  establish  a  Nepal\u2013Tibet  Trade  Facilitation  Committee  was  signed  on  2 \nSeptember 2009. The letter of exchange of 14 May 2010, which provides zero-tariffs for 4,721 \nexports to the PRC, could also serve as an important step in promoting Nepal\u2019s exports to the \nPRC.  \n\nThe Trade and Payments Agreements 1981 also identified three trading points for frontier trade: \nKodari\u2013Nyalam,  Rasuwa\u2013Kerung,  and  Yari  (Humla)\u2013Purang.  Two  further  trading  points, \nKimanthang\u2013Riwu and Nechung (Mustang)\u2013Lizi, were added through letters of exchange on 3 \nDecember 2003, and it was recognized that the Olangchunggola\u2013Riwu trading point was also in \noperation.  The  provisions  of  the  traditional  border  trade  on  barter  basis  and  the  movement  of \nthe border inhabitants were also given continuity by the agreement. The Kodari\u2013Nyalam (41 km) \ntrading  route  was  the  only  trading  point  with  a  road  connection  until  recently.  With  the  recent \ncompletion  of  the  Syaphrubesi\u2013Rasuwagadhi  (18  km)  road,  Rasuwa\u2013Kerung  (22km)  has  also \ncome into operation. \n\n20 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 498 \n\n        \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n    \n\n             Rana and Karmacharya \n\n6.3  Subregional Cooperation and Integration Policies \n\nNepal  has  played  an  active  role  in  the  South  Asian  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation \n(SASEC)  program,  which  is  designed  to  promote  subregional  cooperation  initiatives  between \nBangladesh,  Bhutan,  India,  and  Nepal.  It  aims  to  foster  cooperation  among  these  countries  in \nthe areas of transport, energy, and trade. Nepal perceives that the advantage of SASEC lies in \nits  pragmatic, results-oriented,  and  project-based focus.  ADB  assumed  the  role  of facilitator  in \nsupporting  the  SASEC  initiative  program  as  an  honest  broker.  SASEC  provided  strategic \nidentification  and \ndirections  and  venues \nimplementation  of  cross-border  projects.  Following  the  successful  meetings  of  its  working \ngroups in Bangkok (20\u201322 October 2011) and Kolkata (5 March 2012), the SASEC program has \nmade substantial progress, particularly in the areas of transport, trade facilitation, and energy.  \n\nfor  dialogue  and  decision-making  regarding \n\n6.4  Regional Policies \n\nNepal played an active role in the formation of the economic development-oriented South Asian \nAssociation  for  Regional  Cooperation  (SAARC)  and  hosts  its  secretariat.  The  original \nseven members  (Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India,  the  Maldives,  Nepal,  Pakistan,  and  Sri  Lanka) \nsigned  the  South  Asian  Preferential  Trading  Arrangement  (SAPTA)  in  1993.  Afghanistan \nbecame a member in 2008. The objective of SAPTA was to promote and sustain mutual trade \nand economic cooperation among the member states through exchange of trade concessions. It \nwas  agreed  that  SAPTA  would  be  a  first  step  to  higher  levels  of  trade  liberalization  and \neconomic cooperation among the members.  \n\nNepal is also a party to the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA), whose members have \ncommitted to a 10-year tariff phase-out beginning in 2006. Members reached an agreement on \nsome  outstanding  issues  to  render  SAFTA  effective  from  January  2006,  which  include \nsafeguard  measures\u2014sensitive  lists  (to  be  within  20%  of  the  total  tariff  lines  of  member \ncountries) and rules of origin (at least 40% value addition)\u2014as well as a revenue compensation \nmechanism for the least developed country (LDC) members for loss of customs duties (to be in \nplace  for  4  years).  The  SAFTA  agreement  does  not  address  cross-border  investment  or \nmovement of labor, and no timeframe has been set for eliminating NTBs. In 2010, the SAARC \nAgreement  on  Trade  in  Services  (SATIS)  was  signed  with  the  aim  of  fostering  economic \nintegration in the region.8 \n\nThe net benefits from regional integration under SAFTA for Nepal depend on scale economies \ngained  from  access  to  a  larger  market,  offsetting  any  trade  diversion  and  loss  of  customs \nrevenue (Karmacharya 2005). Given that it already has significantly higher interregional trade by \nvirtue  of  its  ties  with  India,  particularly  important  for  Nepal  would  be  whether  and  how  the \npreferential  trading  agreement  with  India  is  integrated  into  SAFTA.  The  impact  on  tariff-free \nmarket access to the Indian market as well as a reduction in NTBs would be crucial. However, \nas  trade  gains  might  be  limited  by  similar  production  structures  and  factor  endowments, \nappropriate focus would be required on improving trade facilitation (transit agreements, lowering \ntrade-related  costs  through  more  efficient  customs  procedures,  and  harmonizing  standards). \nThe  benefits  of  SAFTA  will  also  depend  on  the  effective  and  time-bound  implementation  of \nsafeguard measures, better infrastructure, and regional connectivity.  \n\n                                                \n8 The signing took place during the Sixteenth SAARC Summit held in Thimpu, Bhutan. \n\n21 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 498 \n\n        \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n    \n\n             Rana and Karmacharya \n\n6.5  Inter-regional Policies \n\nNepal  is  a  member  of  the  Bay  of  Bengal  Initiative  for  Multi-Sectoral  Technical  and  Economic \nCooperation (BIMSTEC), which entered into force in 1997 as a forum to facilitate and promote \ntrade,  investment,  and  technical  cooperation  among  participating  countries.  It  consists  of  five \nSAFTA  member  countries  (Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India,  Nepal,  and  Sri  Lanka),  plus  Myanmar \nand Thailand  of  ASEAN.9 BIMSTEC  has  identified  13 broad  sectors for  cooperation,  including: \ntrade  and  investment,  technology,  tourism,  transport  and  communication,  energy,  agriculture, \nfisheries, poverty alleviation, and counter-terrorism and transnational crimes.10  \n\nIn  2004,  BIMSTEC  parties  agreed  to  establish  the  BIMSTEC  Free  Trade  Area  Framework \nAgreement  on  goods,  services,  and  investment.  Article  3  of  the  agreement  provides  that \nproducts,  except  those  included  in  the  \u201cnegative  list,\u201d  will  be  subject  to  tariff  reduction  or \nelimination  on  the  basis  of  fast  and  normal  tracks  for  its  developing  country  parties  (India,  Sri \nLanka,  and  Thailand)  and  LDC  parties  (Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  Myanmar,  and  Nepal).  Rules  of \norigin have not yet been agreed among BIMSTEC countries. These issues are being discussed \nin BIMSTEC\u2019s Trade Negotiating Committee. \n\n6.6  Multilateral: World Trade Organization and Nepal \n\nNepal  had  applied  for  membership  of  the  General  Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade  (GATT)  in \n1989 and finally acceded to the WTO in April 2004 following a strenuous accession process. It \nbecame  the  first  LDC  member  to  join  the  WTO  through  the  accession  process.  Nepal  is  an \nactive  participant  in  WTO  negotiations.  It  participates  mainly  in  NAMA,  Agriculture,  Services, \nTrade-Related  Aspects  of  Intellectual  Property  Rights  (TRIPS),  Trade  Facilitation,  Sub-\ncommittee  on  Least  Developed  Countries,  Special  and  Differential  (S&D)  treatment,  and \nSanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement (SPS) negotiations. Mostly, Nepal raises issues related \nto LDCs.  \n\nIn  the  process  of  accession,  Nepal  had  made  several  commitments,  many  of  which  have \nalready been implemented. Regarding those that remain to be implemented, although Nepal is \nfully committed to implementing them, the government intends to do so gradually and prudently \nto avoid hurting Nepal's already weak and vulnerable economy as much as possible. As part of \nthis  process,  the  Ministry  of  Commerce  and  Supplies  (MoCS)  has  launched  a  project  to \nformed  a  committee \nimplement \nrepresenting  concerned  agencies  and  other  stakeholders \nto  support  and  oversee \nimplementation of WTO commitments. \n\nthe  remaining  WTO  commitments.

ONGOING AND PRIORITY CONNECTIVITY-RELATED \n\nREGIONAL COOPERATION AND INTEGRATION \nPROJECTS IN NEPAL \n\n7.1  Recently Completed and Ongoing Regional Cooperation and \n\nIntegration Projects \n\nAppendix 2 provides a detailed list of recently completed and ongoing connectivity-related RCI \nprojects  in  Nepal,  together  with  their  expected  benefits  and  costs.11 The  key  RCI  connectivity \nprojects are: \n\n(i)  Nepal  Multimodal  Transit  and Trade  Facilitation Project,  which focused  on  constructing \nInland Container Depots (ICDs) at three locations along the Indian border: a rail-based \nICD at Sirsiya (close to the Birgunj border), where rail traffic from India is transshipped to \nroad trucks in Nepal; and road-based ICDs at Biratnagar in the eastern part of Nepal and \nBhairahawa to the west of Kathmandu. \n\n(ii)  Syaphrubesi\u2013Rasuwagadhi Road Project and the Galchi\u2013Trisuli\u2013Dhunche\u2013Syaphrubesi \nroad under the Road Connectivity Sector I Project: the Syaphrubesi\u2013Rasuwagadhi road \nlinked  Rasuwa  in  Nepal  to  Kerung  in  Tibet  and  together  with  the  Galchi\u2013Trisuli\u2013\nDhunche\u2013Syaphrubesi  road  provides  the  second  alternative  road  connecting  the  PRC \nwith India. It is believed that this road has greater potential than the present one through \nKodari. \n\n(iii) Integrated  Check  Posts  Project,  which  helped  to  construct  and  improve  four  integrated \ncheck  posts  (ICPs)  on  the  border  with  India.  These  included  check  posts  in  Raxaul \n(India)\u2013Birgunj (Nepal), Sunauli (India)\u2013Bhairahawa (Nepal), Jogbani (India)\u2013Biratnagar \n(Nepal), and Nepalgunj Road (India)\u2013Nepalgunj (Nepal). \n\n(iv) B. P. Koirala Highway Project, which seeks to connect the capital city of Kathmandu with \nthe  Eastern  Terai  and  link  them  to  neighboring  cities  in  India.  This  road  link  will  also \nprovide an alternative link between Kathmandu and the Terai. \n\n(v)  Airport  Enhancement  Project,  has  been  upgrading Tribhuvan  International  Airport (TIA) \n\nand three domestic airports. \n\n(vi) Sub  Regional  Transport Enhancement (STEP)  Project,  which  aims  to facilitate  efficient \nand safe transport within Nepal, with India and through India, with Bangladesh, and with \nBhutan  by  (a)  improving  connectivity  of  remote  areas  with  national  and  subregional \nmarkets,  and  (b)  enhancing  the  capacity  of  major  international  trade  corridors  in \nconjunction with customs system improvement. \n\n(vii)  SASEC  Trade  Facilitation  Project  aims  to  help  the  three  SASEC  countries,  including \nNepal,  adopt  an  international  customs  administration  protocol,  upgrade  existing \nautomated  customs  management  systems,  and  establish  web-based  electronic  trade \nportals, which will give importers and exporters timely, accurate information. \n\n(viii) Nepal\u2013India Electricity Transmission and Trade Project, which seeks to establish cross-\nborder  transmission  capacity  of  about  1,000  MW  to  facilitate  electricity  trade  between \nIndia and Nepal and to increase the supply of electricity in Nepal by at least 100 MW. \n\n                                                \n11 For details, see Karmacharya (2013). \n\n23 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 498 \n\n        \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n    \n\n             Rana and Karmacharya \n\n(ix) East\u2013West  Optical  Fibre  Cable  Project,  which  includes  placing  858  km  of  optical  fibre \n\nalong the East\u2013West Highway. \n\n(x)  SASEC  Information  Highway  Project,  which  seeks  to  develop  (i)  a  SASEC  regional \nnetwork with fiber-optic and data interchangeable capacity, (ii) a SASEC village network \nby expanding broadband information and communications technology (ICT) access, and \n(iii) a SASEC research and training network to build technical and business skills in ICT. \n\n(xi) South  Asia  Tourism  Infrastructure  Development  Project,  which  aims  to  develop  the \nNepal  side  of  the  \u201cFootsteps  of  the  Lord  Buddha  Circuit\u201d  by  focusing  interventions  on \nLumbini.  \n\n(xii)  SASEC  Road  Connectivity  Project,  which  aims  to  enhance  local  and  regional \n(India)\u2013\nconnectivity  along \nBanglabandha  (Bangladesh)  regional  road  corridor  identified  by  the  ADB-supported \nSAARC Regional Multimodal Transport Study (SRMTS). In particular, the project aims to \nimprove  the  East\u2013West  Highway  links  around  the  Indian  border  in  the  east  and \nincreasing the cross-border trade volume and hence regional economic growth. \n\n(Nepal)\u2013Panaitanki \n\nthe  Kakarbhitta \n\n(India)\u2013Phulbari \n\n(xiii) Nepal  India  Trade  and  Transport  Facilitation  Project,  which  aims  to  decrease  transport \ntime  and  logistics  costs  for  bilateral  trade  between  Nepal  and  India  and  transit  trade \nalong  the  Kathmandu\u2013Kolkata  corridor  for  the  benefit  of  traders  by  reducing  key \ninfrastructure  bottlenecks  in  Nepal  and  by  supporting  the  adoption  of  modern \napproaches to border management. \n\n(xiv) Tatopani  Frontier  Inspection  Station  Project,  which  seeks  to  construct  a  dry  port  at \nLarcha in Tatopani, the main customs point between Nepal and the PRC. The project is \nexpected  to  facilitate  trade  between  the  two  neighboring  countries  by  reducing  the \nmassive congestion at the Tatopani customs point. \n\n7.2  Priority Regional Cooperation and Integration Connectivity \n\nProjects for Nepal \n\nThe priority RCI connectivity projects that should convert Nepal into a land-linked state are:12 \n\na) Transport Sector (Appendix 3) \n\n(i)  Completion  of  the  Kathmandu\u2013Kulekhani\u2013Hetauda  Tunnel  Road  (the  \u201cTunnel  Road\u201d), \nwhich is at the planning stage and implementation has been proposed to start soon. This \nwill be a new mountainous road along an entirely new alignment connecting Kathmandu \nwith  Hetauda  in  the  south.  The  project  will  be  developed  under  a  PPP  scheme  by  a \nprivate company. \n\n(ii) Upgrading of four important trade routes to six-lane highways to facilitate bilateral trade \nwith  India.  These  include:  (i)  Pathalaiya\u2013Birgunj  (Nepal)\u2013Raxaul  (India)  Road;  (ii) \nDharan\u2013Biratnagar (Nepal)\u2013Jogbani (India) Road; (iii) Belhiya (Nepal)\u2013Sunauli (India) to \nBhairahawa\u2013Butawal Road; and (iv) Suryabinayak\u2013Dhulikhel Road (Appendix 3). \n\n(iii) Upgrading  of  the  Kathmandu\u2013Kolphu\u2013Trishuli\u2013Syaphrubesi\u2013Raswagadhi  corridor  to  a \nhigh  quality  (7-meter  wide  paved)  road  and  connecting  it  to  the  fast-track  Kathmandu\u2013\nBirgunj road. An ICD also needs to be built at Raswagadhi. \n\n                                                \n12 The projects were identified based on the authors\u2019 assessments of their development impacts and discussions with \n\nseveral researchers. \n\n24 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 498 \n\n        \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n    \n\n             Rana and Karmacharya \n\n(iv) Upgrading  of  the  international  airport  in  Kathmandu,  upgrading  of  airports  in  various \nparts  of  the  country  and  building  a  new  international  airport  somewhere  in  the  country \n(possibly  in  Nijgadh)  to  reduce  pressure  at  the  Kathmandu  airport  and  to  act  as  a \ndiversion airport in case of adverse weather.  \n\n(v) Establish new rail links between the Nepalese border towns and the Indian rail network \nat  five  locations  on  the  Indo-Nepal  border. 13 One  of  these  rail  links  could  eventually \nconnect to Kathmandu. \n\n(vi) Consider  the  Trans-Himalayan  Railway  project  to  link  the  PRC  with  India.  For  bulky \nitems,  railroads  will  be  more  cost-effective  than  roads.  Railroads  will  be  more  energy- \nefficient  and  environmentally-friendly  as  well.  A  recent  feasibility  study  has  established \nthe viability of a railway from Kathmandu to Birgunj. Also, the Beijing\u2013Tibet Railway has \nalready reached Xigaste, a PRC city close to Nepal.  \n\nb) Energy  \n\nPrioritize the three projects that were proposed in ADB\u2019s SAARC Regional Energy Trade Study \n(SAARC Secretariat 2010). \n\n(vii) SASEC Power System Expansion ($180 million), which will support the construction and \noperation  of  national  high-voltage  transmission  lines  for  domestic  demand  and  also \nenhance  cross-border  power  trading  capacity.  The  interconnection  between  Nepal  and \nIndia will eventually form part of interconnected SASEC power systems. \n\n(viii) Subregional Transmission Capacity Expansion Project ($225 million), which targets the \nstrengthening  and  expansion  of  transmission  systems  and  will  enable  Nepal  to  benefit \nmore extensively from its abundant hydropower resources. \n\n(ix) Project  Preparatory  Facility  ($21  million),  which  is  intended  to  prepare  a  series  of \nhydropower  projects  and  related  transmission  infrastructure  for  development  in  Nepal, \nemphasizing private sector participation and regional integration. \n\nc) Trade Facilitation \n\n(x) Prioritize modernizing customs procedure under the SASEC Trade Facilitation Program II \n\n($60 million) supported by ADB. \n\n8.  CONCLUSIONS \n\nThis paper makes the case for a connectivity-driven development strategy for Nepal by making \nit a land-linked state between South Asia, the Association of Southeast Asian nations (ASEAN), \nand the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). It has argued that such a strategy is not a really new \none  for  Nepal  as  in  the  past  the  country  was  strategically  located  on  the  Southwestern  Silk \nRoad. A number of factors have strengthened the case for reviving the Southwestern Silk Road \nfor the mutual benefits of the countries it straddles. However, a large number of constraints will \nhave  to  be  overcome  for  Nepal  to  be  able  to  realize  this  vision.  The  main  constraints  are  the \nunstable  political  situation  and  rampant  corruption  in  the  country\u2014which  is  hampering \nimplementation  of  projects\u2014the  chronic  lack  of  financial  resources,  and  the  lack  of  goodwill \nfrom  some  of  the  neighboring  countries.  The  quality  of  infrastructure  is  also  poor  in  Nepal. \nPartnerships  with  neighboring  countries  and  donor  support  will  be  the  key  factors  determining \nthe success of the proposed connectivity-driven strategy. \n\n                                                \n13 Nepalgunj, Bhairahawa, Janakpur, Biratnagar, and Kakarbhitta. \n\n25 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 498 \n\n        \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n    \n\n             Rana and Karmacharya \n\nThis  paper  has  proposed  four  conceptual  corridors  to  connect  South  Asia  with  the  PRC  and \nASEAN.

This  continued  during  the  British  colonial \nrule  over  India  and  to  the  present  day.  While  trading  with  India  is  important  for  Nepal,  India\u2019s \nmotivation  for  trading  with  Nepal  is  largely  strategic  because  the  volume  of  trade  with  Nepal \nrepresents only a fraction of India\u2019s trade globally. Although relations between India and Nepal \nare intimately intertwined, they are fraught with difficulties, due in part to the asymmetric power \nrelations between the two neighbors (SAWTEE 2012a). \n\nHistorically, Nepal\u2019s cultural and economic ties with Tibet were also quite extensive. There are \nhundreds  of  cave  dwellings  in  the  upper  Mustang  Valley  of  Nepal  filled  with  magnificent \ncenturies old Hindu and Buddhist paintings. These vast cave settlements are evidence that the \nvalley  was frequented  by  pilgrims from Tibet  and India (Bohara  2010). On  the  economic front, \nNepal  and  Tibet  traded  salt,  rugs,  and  spices  for  centuries  and  Nepal  used  to  have  a  strong \nbusiness presence in Lhasa. Even now, there are hundreds of Nepalese permanently settled in \nTibet (Bohara 2010). \n\nIn  those  days,  cultural  and  trade  relations  between  the  PRC  and  India  were  close.  As  Tan \n(1999) writes, \u201cIndia and PRC are naturally a pair of sister countries. Their similarities and their \nassociations  are great, numerous,  and  intimate.  Looking  over  the geography  and  history  of  all \nthe nations in the world, we find there are not any other two nations that can be compared to our \ntwo  countries.  This  is  true  from  every  respect  and  from  every  standard  of  observation  and \njudgment. Our two countries, both situated in the bright and glorious continent of Asia. India to \nthe  south\u2013west  and  PRC to the  north-east,  spread  out  lordly  in  different  directions  but  yet  are \nlinked up at the main line, just like the two wheels of a carriage or the two wings of a bird, and, \neven better to say, like the two hands and feet or the two ears and eyes of a person. And the \nHimalayas,  gigantic  and  majestic,  brilliant  and  magnificent,  exactly  resemble  the  common \nbackbone,  or  the  shoulders,  or  the  neck,  and  also  the  nerve  system  of  theirs.  Though  their \nboundaries are marked off, yet the physical shape is similar.\u201d \n\nNepal also used to be an entrep\u00f4t or a gateway for India and PRC trade during historical times, \nas alluded to in the preceding paragraph, and the country benefited significantly from this role.1 \nIn  those  days,  prosperity  of  Nepal  and  its  major  cities  was  well  synchronized  with  those  of  its \nneighbors in the north and the south and during much of the Moghul era and the Tang dynasty \nin the PRC, Nepal was a prosperous state (Pandey 2010). The Licchavi and Malla kings in the \n14th and 15th centuries, in particular, encouraged Nepalese businessmen to arbitrage between \nthe two  countries.  One Licchavi  king,  Angsuverma,  even got  his  daughter,  Bhrikuti, married to \nthe emperor of Tibet. \n\n                                                \n1 For centuries Nepal was a cradle of refuse in the middle of the Himalayas. It was a place where Hinduism, \n\nBuddhism, and Animism met (www.panasiacreativity.com). \n\n29 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 498        \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n    \n\n              \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRana and Karmacharya \n\nAPPENDIX 2  \n\n \n \n\nNepal Multimodal \nTransport  \n(1997\u20132003) \n\nSector/ \nSubsector \nTF \n\nRoad/TF \n\nSubregional \nTransport \nFacilitation Project \n(2005\u20132010) \n\nTable A2: Detailed List of Recently Completed and Ongoing Regional Cooperation and Integration Connectivity Projects in \nNepal, 2010 onward \n\nDescription/Components \n\nBenefits \n\nCost \n\nFunding \nSource \n$21.4 million  World Bank \n\n$27 million \n\nADB \n\nConstruction  of  ICDs  at  three  locations  along  the \nIndian border: a rail based ICD at Sirsiya, Birgunj; \nand \nICDs  at  Biratnagar  and \nBhairahawa. \n\nroad  based \n\ni.

The authors \nmake the case for a connectivity-driven development strategy for the country. They argue that \nimproved  connectivity  within  Nepal  and  cross-border  connectivity  with  its  neighbors  in  South \nAsia, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) that are converting Nepal from a landlocked into a land-linked state, could be important \n\u201cengines of growth\u201d for the country. It is argued that such a development strategy is not a new \none  for  Nepal  as  in  the  past  the  country  was  strategically  located  on  the  Southwestern  Silk \nRoad (SSR). A number of factors have revived the case for making Nepal a land-linked state in \nAsia.  Nepal  has  adopted  a  multi-track  approach  to  promoting  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration in connectivity with its neighbors. But a lot more needs to be done, especially in the \ncontext of the difficult political situation in the country, and donors have an important role to play \nin this regard. Ten priority projects to convert Nepal into a land-linked state are identified, but a \ndetailed impact analysis of these projects is beyond the scope of this paper. \n", " \n", "JEL Classification: F15 \n", " \nThis paper was produced as part of the ADB\u2013ADBI flagship project on \u201cConnecting South Asia \nand Southeast Asia.\u201d\n", " \n \n"]}
