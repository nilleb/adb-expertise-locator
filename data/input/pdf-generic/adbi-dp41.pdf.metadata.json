The \nviews expressed in this paper are the views of the author and do not necessarily reflect \nthe view or policies of the Asian Development Bank Institute. \n\n\fThis paper examines the inter-relationships between subregionalism, regionalism, \nand multilateralism using the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) and the ASEAN Free \nTrade Area (AFTA) as case studies.  In particular, we look at whether subregionalism or \nregionalism can assist a country in moving towards multilateralism. We find that the \nGMS program is assisting its members to integrate more closely with the ASEAN region \nand, through this, with the rest of the world. As a program based on market rather than \ninstitutional integration, the GMS is promoting regionalism without hampering \nmultilateralism.  With regard to AFTA, if members pursue open regionalism and offer \ntheir trade and other preferences to nonmembers on a nondiscriminatory basis, then this \nis consistent with the objectives of multilateralism.  For the original ASEAN members, \nAFTA has actually hastened the speed at which they have moved towards their goal of \nfree trade because of the ambitious liberalization program it has committed them to.  The \nnewer ASEAN members should follow suit if they are going to maximize the benefits \nfrom liberalization and minimize the costs associated with trade diversion and trade, \nproduction, and investment deflection. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \nI.  Introduction \n \n\nThe last two decades have witnessed a proliferation of formal regional trading \narrangements (RTAs) mostly in the form of free trade areas (FTAs). There is strong \ndemand to form or to join RTAs on political grounds.  As Bhagwati (1997) puts it, \u201cNo \npolitician is happy unless he has put his signature on at least one of them.\u201d There is also \nan apparently strong compulsion to avoid being an outsider on economic grounds.1  As \nfar back as 1964, Robert Mundell demonstrated how trading partners who do not join a \npreferential trading arrangement might be made worse off (through terms of trade \neffects)2 even when global welfare is enhanced. Even in the absence of terms of trade \neffects, the fact that an outsider\u2019s competitors may have negotiated preferential access \nto its major markets suggests that the costs of not joining could be high.  The threat of \ntrade and investment diversion is viewed as a compelling reason to seek membership in \nRTAs (Lawrence1996). \n \n\nMore recently, however, there has been significant interest in less formal \narrangements sometimes referred to as growth triangles or quadrangles or more \ngenerally as subregionalism.3 Every member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) \ntoday is also a member of at least one subregional or regional cooperation arrangement, \nmany are members of both, and some are even members of multiples of each.  This is \nsometimes referred to as the \u201dspaghetti bowl\u201d effect (Bhagwati 1993).  \n \n\nIn light of these developments, it is pertinent to ask the question, what are the inter-\n\nrelationships between subregionalism, regionalism, and multilateralism?  Apart from the \ninter-relationships, it is also interesting to consider the conditions under which \nsubregionalism or regionalism can assist a country in moving towards multilateralism. \nPut a different way; is there anything that countries can do to ensure that their \nmembership in subregional or regional cooperation arrangements will act as building \nrather than stumbling blocks towards free and open trade and investment? The \nrelevance of this question is rooted in the fact that, in economic terms, preferential trade \nliberalization will always be inferior to nondiscriminatory or multilateral tariff reductions.4 \nThus, if subregionalism or regionalism can help move a country towards multilateralism, \nthen it is working in the right direction. \n \n\nIn answering these questions, we use the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) \n\ncooperation arrangement to represent subregionalism and the Association of Southeast \n\n                                                 \n1   As  of  1994,  all  but  3  of  the  128  members  of  the  General  Agreement  on  Trade  and  Tariffs  were  also \nmembers  of  at  least  one  RTA  (see  Sampson  1996).    Hong  Kong,  China;  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina;  Japan;  and  the  Republic  of  Korea  were  the  exceptions,  but  the  latter  two  have  negotiated \nbilateral trade agreements since then. If the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation initiative is included as \nan RTA, then there are no exceptions.  \n\n2   This occurs when the preferential arrangement is large enough to affect world prices, and outsiders as a \n\nwhole are harmed because their terms of trade deteriorate as a result of trade diversion. \n\n3   There has also been a sharp increase in the number of bilateral trading arrangements of late, most of \nwhich are quite formal and comprehensive and as such are treated here like any other regional FTA. \n4   As Cooper and Massell (1965) have shown, a nondiscriminatory tariff reduction will enable a country to \nenjoy  trade  creation  without  any  trade  diversion.  Furthermore,  the  extent  of  trade  creation  under \nmultilateral  liberalization  would  be  either  equal  to  or  greater  than  that  possible  within  a  preferential \ntrading arrangement. The extent of trade creation under multilateral liberalization would be greater than \nthat  possible  with  preferential  liberalization  if  the  lowest-cost  producer  lies  outside  the  grouping  and \nwould be equal to it if the lowest-cost producer were a member. \n\n\fAsian Nations (ASEAN) Free Trade Area (AFTA) to represent regionalism.  These \nchoices are appropriate for our purpose because all countries in the GMS cooperation \narrangement are also members of AFTA and are either already members of the WTO or \nare actively pursuing membership.  \n \n\nThe paper is organized in 6 sections.  Section 2 provides a brief overview of the \nGMS program and AFTA to set the stage for the ensuing analysis. In Section 3, we \nexamine how subregionalism is affecting both regionalism and multilateralism. Next, we \nturn to the relationship between regionalism and multilateralism.  One of the questions \nthat we attempt to answer in this section is whether it is necessary to have \u201dopen \nregionalism\u201d in order for the arrangement to be a building block towards multilateral \nprinciples and objectives.  In other words, can multilateral objectives be achieved even \nwithout open regionalism? This question is relevant because some countries in the \nregion have pursued open regionalism while others have been somewhat reluctant to do \nso. In Section 5, we look at what additional benefits WTO membership can bring to \ncountries that are already members of both subregional and regional cooperation \narrangements.  A final section summarizes the main points. \n \n \nII.  The  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Program  and  ASEAN  Free  Trade  Area:  An \n\nOverview \n\n \nA.  The GMS Program \n \n\nThe origins of the GMS can be traced to the 1957 establishment of the Mekong \nCommittee, which then comprised the four riparian countries of the lower Mekong Basin. \nThe region was, however, racked by conflict, so there was little cooperation over the \nfollowing three decades. The process gained substance only in 1992 when ADB initiated \na more organized program of cooperation among its members.  The original members of \nthe GMS were Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Myanmar, \nThailand, Viet Nam, and Yunnan Province of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). In \n2004, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of the PRC also joined the GMS. \n \n\nThe GMS program is a classic case of market as opposed to institutional integration. \n\nWhile institutional integration is characterized by legal agreements and institutional \narrangements that promote preferential trade among members of the agreement, market \nintegration relies on nonofficial institutions that provide public and quasi-public goods \nthat reduce transaction costs associated with the international movement of goods, \nservices, and other production factors (Cooper 1968; Garnaut and Drysdale 1994). \n \n\nAs a program of market-based integration, the GMS agenda has concentrated on the \n\nprovision of physical infrastructure that has public good characteristics, e.g., cross-\nborder infrastructure.  Indeed, essential infrastructure of all types remains \nunderdeveloped in most of the GMS economies, and the GMS program has focused on \novercoming this constraint. Initiatives such as the east-west, north-south, and southern \neconomic corridors are creating a network of roads that connect the region, reducing the \ncost of transporting goods and people from one corner of the region to the other.5 \nOptions for interconnections for power transmission and the development of fiber optic \ntransmission links\u2014both covered through the GMS flagship programs on power and \n                                                 \n5   For a recent analysis of the economic and social impacts of projects, see ADB (2005). \n\n\ftelecommunications\u2014also fall within the geographic scope of these corridors. As argued \nby Mussa (2000), the role that transport and communication infrastructure plays in \ndriving economic integration should not be under-estimated.  In many ways, the \nreductions in transport and communication costs taking place in much of the Mekong \nregion today parallel those that took place in the industrialized world decades ago. \n \n\nApart from \u201chardware\u201d in the form of physical infrastructure, the GMS program has \nalso tried to address complementary \u201csoftware\u201d issues. The facilitation of cross-border \ntrade and investment is another key feature of increasing subregional economic \nintegration in the GMS. The GMS program supports a range of measures to facilitate \ntrade and investment that are designed to promote integration. These include improving \nprocedures and transparency for customs clearance and enhancing technical skills to \nimprove the application of various regulatory systems. Included in these efforts is the \npilot testing of single-stop procedures of customs inspection at selected border sites. \nResearch conducted by UNCTAD and cited in the Joint Study Group (2000) suggests \nthat customs paperwork and procedures costs add up to about 7% of the global value of \ntrade (see also Hertel et al., 2001). This is likely to be an understatement of these costs \nin the case of the Mekong region given initial conditions, or the relatively poor state of \nsuch systems and procedures at present. The GMS program is also helping member \neconomies prepare for a single GMS visa system. Besides promoting tourism and \nreducing the direct cost of cross-border control and management, a single-visa system \nwould have indirect but positive effects on trade and investment. \n \n\nThe direct impact of interventions through the GMS program is already being \n\nreflected in trade and investment statistics for the subregion. Cross-border trade among \nthe six GMS economies has increased sharply. For example, Thailand\u2019s imports from its \nthree neighboring countries, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Cambodia has been increasing by \nan annual compound growth rate of almost 10% since 2000. More than two thirds of Lao \nPDR\u2019s trade is with other GMS economies; more than a third is with Myanmar, and \nabout a fourth is with Cambodia. In 2004, these three countries conducted more than \n40% of their trade with each other. Nonetheless, a significant portion of trade among the \nGMS economies is not recorded. The nature of this type of trade makes it difficult to \nknow its magnitude, but estimates range from about 30\u201350% or more of total recorded \ntrade. \n \n\nThe trend is similar for intra-GMS net foreign direct investment (FDI) flows. Net FDI \n\nflows from the six GMS economies to Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and \nViet Nam combined rose sharply from $130 million in 2000 to about $210 million in 2002, \nand estimates suggest that this growth trend has continued since. That trade and \ninvestment are growing hand-in-hand in the subregion is no coincidence. Early signs of a \ntrade-investment nexus are emerging whereby trade not only encourages investment, \nbut investment, in turn, encourages trade. This is a virtuous circle that links back to \neconomic growth (Athukorala and Menon 1997). \n \nB.  AFTA \n \n\nAlthough the origins of ASEAN date back to the early 1960s, it was officially \n\nlaunched in August 1967 as a result of the Bangkok Declaration.  The original members \nwere Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. Brunei\u2019s accession in \n1984 brought the total membership to six nations. During its early phase, ASEAN \n\n\foperated as a consensus-based, politico-security community with little attention paid to \neconomic issues. On the economic front, ASEAN was dormant for its first 10 years.   \n \nThe first attempt at promoting intra-ASEAN trade through institutional integration via \nregional trade preferences occurred at the Bali Summit in 1976 when ASEAN adopted \npreferential trading arrangements (PTA).  Despite some initial promise and enthusiasm, the \narrangements had little impact on intra-regional trade.  In short, they were a failure. There \nwere a number of reasons for this.  First, the commodity coverage was narrow, and \nimplementation was half-hearted.  Second, the size of the proposed tariff cuts was too \nsmall to have any discernable effect on trade flows.  On top of this, the PTA failed to deal \nadequately with non-tariff barriers, which were a greater impediment to trade than tariffs \nwere (see Menon 1996 for a fuller discussion of these issues). \n \n \nASEAN trade liberalization.  At the summit meeting of ASEAN heads of state in January \n1992, the six agreed to establish AFTA by the year 2008. This deadline was subsequently \nmoved forward to 2003. AFTA represents the most ambitious attempt at regional \nintegration by ASEAN thus far.  It is also the first political attempt to bring about regional \nfree trade in Asia.   \n \n\nIt took until the early 1990s before the next formal attempt was made to pursue intra-\n\nThe centerpiece of the AFTA proposal is the common effective preference tariff \n\n(CEPT).  It differs from the PTA in that its approach is essentially by sectors, making it more \ncomprehensive and less cumbersome than the item-by-item approach of the PTA.  The \nobjective of the CEPT scheme is to lay the foundation for the creation of a single ASEAN \nmarket.  Under the revised AFTA plan, tariffs were to be reduced to 20% within a time \nframe of 5\u20138 years (beginning in January 1993) before they were cut to 0\u20135% by the year \n2003.  This target has already been virtually realized for the six original members of \nASEAN.  \n \n\nThe first step in the widening of AFTA took place at the Fifth ASEAN Summit on 15 \nDecember 1995 when Viet Nam joined and acceded to the CEPT agreement. Lao PDR \nand Myanmar joined in 1997 while Cambodia came on board in 2000. For Viet Nam, the \ntarget date when 0\u20135% tariffs will apply to most intra-ASEAN trade is 2006. Lao PDR \nand Myanmar must adopt these tariff rates by 2008, and Cambodia by 2010.  \n \n\nBesides having tariff lines with strictly reciprocal preferences, the ASEAN integration \n\nsystem of preferences (AISP) was initiated to accelerate integration of the CLMV \ncountries (Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Viet Nam) into the regional market for \ntrade in goods. At the 15th AFTA Council Ministerial Meeting in 2001, the original ASEAN \nmembers agreed to unilaterally extend tariff preferences to ASEAN's new members \nbeginning 1 January 2002. This move is unprecedented for ASEAN, which has always \noperated on the basis of equal partnership. Although the AISP is implemented bilaterally \nand voluntarily, it is based on products that the CLMV countries themselves propose \u2014 \nnot on those proposed by the providing countries. This provision was designed to avoid \nthe so-called \u201csnow-plow effect\u201d whereby providing countries tend to extend preferences \non tariff lines where there is little or no intra-regional trade.  \n \n \n\n\fIII.  Subregionalism: Impact on Regionalism and Multilateralism6 \n\nHow is the subregionalism of the GMS program affecting regionalism and \n\nmultilateralism? Are these intensive efforts at promoting subregionalism taking place at \nthe expense of openness? We have already noted the rapid increase in intra-GMS trade \nand FDI flows, but is this running the risk of making the subregion more inward looking? \nThe short answer is \u201cno.\u201d  \n \n\nAs noted in Section 2.1, the GMS program is a classic case of market as opposed to \n\ninstitutional integration. There is no legal agreement prescribing preferential tariff \nconcessions, so there is no potential for trade diversion as a result of the integration \narrangement. Although there is no avenue for the textbook definition of trade diversion, \nis the GMS program giving its members an unfair advantage over nonmembers by \nmaking the movement of goods, services, and factors of production less costly inside the \nsubregion compared with outside? In other words, is not an implicit subsidy to insiders \njust as bad as an explicit tax on outsiders? The short answer in this case is again \u201cno.\u201d \n  \n\nAlthough the hardware and software initiatives of the GMS program are mainly \n\ndirected at promoting trade and investment, nothing in their design or application \nconfines their impacts to the subregion. These public and quasi-public goods, once \nprovided in or for the subregion, will also improve economic relations with the ASEAN \nregion as a whole. In other words, subregionalism is driving regionalism because the \nway in which these subregional public goods are provided also enables them to operate \nas regional public goods.7 \n \n\nEmerging transport networks and economic corridors in the subregion are \ntransforming its economic geography (ADB 2004). As connectivity between GMS \ncountries improves, their linkage with the region as a whole is also enhanced. For \nexample, when the economic corridors are completed, it should be technically feasible \nfor goods to be transported by land from Singapore through Malaysia to anywhere in the \nsubregion. Apart from physical connectivity, various legal and other software issues \ncurrently stand in the way of such a movement of goods.  To address them and other \nrelated issues, trade and investment facilitation measures that are nondiscriminatory and \nWTO-consistent are being pursued subregionally. They complement measures AFTA is \npursuing. Thus, directly or indirectly, countries outside the subregion will also have \naccess to these initiatives and measures, so they will contribute on a general level to \nincreased trade and investment. Thus not only can subregionalism be consistent with \nregionalism, but the former can also be a catalyst in driving progress with the latter.  \n \n\nOn the other hand, what is the effect of subregionalism on multilateralism? Although \n\nthe vast majority of positive spillover effects currently appear to be confined to the \nregion, there are already signs that they are beginning to spread to outside countries. \nOver time, we should observe that subregional initiatives not only promote regionalism \nbut also indirectly contribute to multilateralism as trade and investment increase globally. \nIn other words, these subregional public goods can operate not only as regional public \ngoods; they also have the potential to be global public goods.  Consider the land-locked \ncase of Lao PDR for instance.  Without the economic corridors that provide road access \nto ports in neighboring countries, its exports to the rest of the world would be severely \n                                                 \n6 Sections III and IV draw freely upon Menon (2005). \n7   For a recent review of regional public goods, see Estevadeordal et al. (2005). \n\n\fconstrained by high transport costs.  The same would be true for its imports from the rest \nof the world.  In this way, connectivity through infrastructure development is reducing \n\u201cnatural protection\u201d in a nondiscriminatory manner. \n \n\nThe GMS program itself provides a different kind of example of this phenomenon.  It \nhas helped its members become more effective members of ASEAN. This, in turn, will \nhelp them become more effective and visible members of the global community. These \ninterrelations operate not only in terms of outcomes, however, but also in the process of \nmoving toward these outcomes. For example, measures to facilitate subregional trade \nand investment complement many of the liberalization measures pursued as part of \nAFTA membership. This, in turn, helps some AFTA members prepare for WTO \naccession. \n  \n \nIV.  Regionalism: Impact on Multilateralism  \n \n\nIn this section, we examine how regionalism a la AFTA is affecting multilateralism. \n\nUnlike the GMS program of subregional cooperation, AFTA clearly falls within the \ntextbook definition of institutional as opposed to market integration. In essence, AFTA is \na preferential trading arrangement based on a legal agreement that prescribes tariff \nreductions on a purely discriminatory basis. It therefore has all the ingredients necessary \nfor trade diversion and the potential to produce a classic second-best outcome where \nthe welfare of even its members is reduced as a result.  Necessary? Yes. Sufficient? No.  \nAlthough AFTA members must extend trade preferences on a reciprocal basis and in \naccordance with a predetermined time frame, there is nothing that prevents members \nfrom voluntarily extending the same preferences to nonmembers. This is largely what \nthe original ASEAN members have been doing by embracing the concept of \u201copen \nregionalism\u201d and thereby largely avoiding the second-best outcome. \n\nA.  Multilateralism through Open Regionalism \n \n\nTo minimize trade diversion, the original ASEAN members have been reducing their \n\nexternal tariffs, or tariffs applicable to non-ASEAN members, in conjunction with \nreductions on intra-ASEAN trade. This has minimized the margin of preference, or the \ndifference between intra- and extra-ASEAN tariff rates, and thus minimized the potential \nfor trade diversion. When preferences are fully multilateralized, the margin of preference \nis zero as is the potential for trade diversion. This was the case for more than two-thirds \nof the tariff lines for the original ASEAN countries in 2002 (see Feridhanusetyawan, \n2005) and this continues to increase year by year.  Furthermore, because the \npreferential tariff reduction schedules have been ambitious and rapid, AFTA has \naccelerated the pace of multilateral trade liberalization in the original ASEAN member \ncountries. Instead of jeopardizing multilateralism, it has hastened the speed at which \nthese countries have moved towards their goal of free and open trade.  In this way, \nAFTA\u2019s greatest achievement may have less to do with what it prescribes or mandates \nand more to do with what it promotes indirectly through the long-standing commitment of \nits members to the concept of open regionalism. \n\n \nFigure 1 compares, in stylized form, trade liberalization outcomes under various \n\nscenarios involving WTO and AFTA.  WTO negotiations and outcomes reduce the \namount of time required for countries to move towards their goal of free and open trade \n\n\f(defined here as 0-5% average tariff rates).  How does AFTA affect this outcome?  If \nAFTA is implemented on a purely minimalist basis, or without any multilateralization of \ntariff preferences, then the time taken to arrive at the aforementioned goal is unchanged.  \nAverage tariff rates do fall more rapidly however, particularly up to AFTA\u2019s 2003 deadline \nfor 0-5% internal tariff rates, but this gain could be offset by the trade diversion that it \nwould also induce.  If, however, members choose to fully multilateralize their preferences \nfor all tariff lines soon after AFTA\u2019s commencement, then the deadline for free and open \ntrade is moved forward to coincide with AFTA\u2019s deadline of 2003.  In reality, we observe \nthat preferences for a majority of tariff lines have been fully multilateralized and if the \nremaining one-third or so of tariff lines are dealt with in the same way relatively soon, \nthen the deadline will fall somewhere between 2003 and the WTO-based deadline. If this \nhappens, AFTA would have served as a building block that enables countries to pursue \nmultilateral goals at a faster pace. \n \n\nEmulation of the approach taken by the original members would be in the interest of \nthe Mekong economies. Indeed they will need to emulate this approach if they are not to \nbe left behind, and if they are to succeed in deepening regional integration. Regionalism \nthrough ASEAN membership could then provide the GMS economies with an \nopportunity to pursue multilateralism aggressively and thus allow regionalism through \nAFTA to be a building block rather than stumbling block toward free and open trade. \nHowever, whether the worldwide proliferation of RTAs will eventually integrate rather \nthan fragment the world economy remains a separate and open question. \n \n\nThere are reasons apart from minimizing trade diversion why the new member \ncountries should emulate their predecessors in concurrently bringing down external \ntariffs. The freedom of members of an FTA to set their own barriers against trade with \nnonmembers raises the possibility of trade, production, and investment deflection. Trade \ndeflection occurs when imports enter the FTA via the member country with the lowest \ntariff on nonmember trade. Trade deflection distorts the region\u2019s trading patterns with the \nrest of the world and deprives the member country that eventually consumes the import \nof tariff revenue. In the case of the GMS, revenue is likely to be lost to a member like \nSingapore, which is virtually a free-trade port. \n \n\nProduction deflection will occur if the manufacture of products containing imported \n\ninputs shifts to countries that have lower tariffs on the inputs because differences in \ntariffs outweigh differences in production costs. This is detrimental to economic \nefficiency and welfare since the pattern of productive activity will be based on differences \nin duties rather than on comparative advantage. The deflection of production may also \naffect the pattern of international investment. If differences in tariffs outweigh differences \nin production costs, tariffs will dictate investment decisions. Investment deflection will \nreinforce detrimental effects on welfare and efficiency associated with production \ndeflection. Although the GMS economies may not currently be subject to much \nproduction or investment deflection because most are still not developed enough to \ncompete with the other ASEAN members for the same types of investments, they could \navoid it in the future by multilateralizing their AFTA tariff preferences. \n \n\nTo deal with potential trade, production, and investment deflection, AFTA imposes \n\n\u201cdomestic ASEAN content\u201d requirements based on \u201crules of origin.\u201d These rules limit \nregional trade preferences to commodities that incorporate a minimum of 40% domestic \nASEAN content. At best, application of these rules can only limit, but not eliminate, \ntrade, production, and investment deflection in AFTA. Krueger (1995) goes further to \n\n\fsuggest that these rules can lead to the \u201cexport\u201d of protection. This occurs when a \nmember country deliberately purchases a higher-cost input from another member rather \nthan the lower-cost alternative from a nonmember in order to satisfy rules of origin \nrequirements and to gain duty-free access for its end-product exports. \n \n\nFurthermore, rules of origin are notoriously difficult to police, and the administrative \nburden can be substantial. Not only is the origin of a product difficult to determine in this \nera of increasing internationalization of production, but the transaction costs resulting \nfrom the extensive documentation associated with this cumbersome process could \nnullify any benefits coming from freer intra-regional trade. In many of the GMS \neconomies, the administrative costs associated with implementing rules of origin or \nmeasuring domestic content could be crippling. \n \n\nAdoption of the nondiscriminatory approach to regionalism by the new member \n\ncountries would maximize the extent and pace of their integration with the global \neconomy. They could avoid trade diversion, as well as trade, production, and investment \ndeflection. The new members could also do away with the tedious and costly tasks of \nimplementing rules of origin and measuring domestic content of their imports. This would \nbe the first-best option.  \n \nB.  Multilateralism Even Without Open Regionalism? \n \n\nA myriad of political economy considerations often stands in the way of first-best \neconomic solutions. As Krugman (1993) puts it, preferential trading arrangements may \nhave to be accepted, \u201c\u2026more or less grudgingly, as the best option in an age of \ndiminished expectations.\u201d This view may derive from the fact that the first-best option of \nnondiscriminatory trade liberalization may not always be politically feasible, or at least \nnot immediately feasible, and that the second-best option is to liberalize trade within \nregional blocks. In some of the Mekong countries, concerns relating to the impact on \ngovernment revenue and the competitiveness of domestic production appear to stand in \nthe way of multilateral trade preferences (see Appendix 1).  \n \n\nIn light of this, the question then is whether the pursuit of discriminatory regionalism \n\nnecessarily implies that multilateralism will be impaired?  This need not be so for the \nGMS economies in AFTA. Even if they chose not to multilateralize their preferences, \nregionalism can work in other ways as a vehicle to promote closer integration with the \nrest of the world. Even as a second-best option, regionalism through AFTA can help in \nthe pursuit of multilateralism.  \n \n\nOne avenue through which regionalism can promote multilateralism is through the \nstrong links that the original ASEAN countries have with industrialized nations. Regional \nintegration is bringing globalization to the doorstep of the Mekong through these links. \nIncreasing integration with the original ASEAN countries will provide the GMS \neconomies with a conduit to the outside world. Because the original ASEAN members \nconduct most of their trade extra-regionally and receive most of their FDI from non-\nASEAN members, they have long-established links with the major industrialized \ncountries. By integrating more closely with the original ASEAN members, the GMS \neconomies will increase their opportunities for trade and investment with the rest of the \nworld. \n \n\n\fIndeed, the objective of establishing the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) by \n2020, a decision made at the 2003 Bali Summit, is to present this region of 530 million or \nso people to the global community as a single market and production base with a free \nflow of goods and services and relatively free flows of capital and labor.  The AEC \nprovides the GMS economies with a great opportunity to increase trade and investment \nwith the outside world and to integrate more closely with the world economy.8  \n \n\nThe strategic location of the GMS between the burgeoning economies of the PRC \n\nand India provides opportunities for integration beyond the region and presents a \nnumber of opportunities. The potential to boost trade, tourism, and investment is \nsignificant. Recognizing this potential, ASEAN leaders again confirmed their commitment \nto regionalism as a means to an end by signing framework agreements at the Bali \nSummit on comprehensive economic cooperation with both the PRC and India. These \nagreements will create free-trade areas between ASEAN and these countries.9  \n \n \nV.  Multilateralism through the WTO \n \n\nSome GMS economies are pursing multilateralism directly and independently \n\nthrough WTO membership while others seek to join. Myanmar and Thailand have been \nmembers for some time, and Cambodia joined WTO in September 2003. The other GMS \neconomies, Lao PDR and Viet Nam, are aggressively seeking membership.  \n \n\nIn previous sections, we have argued that both subregionalism and regionalism can \nbe consistent with the pursuit of multilateralism.  More than that, and depending on the \nway in which countries go about it, both subregionalism and regionalism can actually \ncontribute to multilateralism.  If this is the case, what additional benefits, if any, will there \nbe for members of subregional or regional cooperation arrangements in pursuing WTO \nmembership? \n\n \nWTO membership now will have less impact on Lao PDR and Viet Nam than it might \n\nhave had prior to AFTA. Lao PDR conducts most of its trade with other ASEAN \ncountries, so it already receives most favored nation (MFN) and national treatment (NT) \nstatus in these countries as a result of AFTA membership, which is what WTO \nmembership, would have conferred. Lao PDR also already receives preferential \ntreatment from many non-ASEAN trading partners, particularly the European Union. \nWTO membership will not affect that. With the recent granting of normal trade relation \n(NTR) status with the United States (US), Lao PDR is no longer the only Asian country \n\n                                                 \n8  \n\nIn the agreement that lays the foundation for AEC\u2019s establishment, ASEAN gave priority to integrating \n11 industrial sectors: wood, rubber, automotive, textiles, electronics, agriculture, information technology, \nfisheries, health care, air travel, and tourism. Many of these sectors are important to the GMS \neconomies. \n\n9   Closer integration with the burgeoning economy of the PRC in particular, but also with India\u2019s, is widely \nacknowledged not only to present opportunities but also to create challenges. The PRC and India have \nlarge  reserve  pools  of  labor  and  thus  have  cost  advantages  in  labor-intensive  activities.  With  the \nscheduled  end  of  the  Multi-Fiber  Agreement  in  2005,  both  countries  may  be  in  a  position  to  increase \nexports  of  textiles  and  clothing.  Some  of  this  could  be  at  the  expense  of  GMS  economies.  The  GMS \neconomies must eventually face the reality that the world\u2019s trading environment is changing in such a \nway that preferential treatment must eventually give way to comparative advantage. The challenge that \nthis  poses  for  the  GMS  is  to  restructure  production  to  focus  on  activities  in  which  they  have  a \ncomparative cost advantage. The best trade policy  environment to encourage specialization based on \ncomparative advantage is one based on multilateralism. \n\n\fto face punitive tariffs on its exports to that country. In short, many of the benefits that \nWTO membership would have delivered have already been realized through \nmembership in AFTA. \n \n\nViet Nam has a comprehensive and wide-ranging bilateral trade agreement with the \n\nUS and recently signed a trade and investment agreement with Japan that solidifies \nMFN and NT status for its trade and investment. The bilateral trade agreement with the \nUS involves various commitments that will not only complement its push for WTO \nmembership but will also fast track many of the benefits of that membership. In other \nwords, the reform measures that Viet Nam is now implementing for the US bilateral \nagreement and the benefits that accrue from these measures plus the concessions that \nthe US provides will lessen the net impact of WTO accession.  \n \n\nThese are good things; they reaffirm the complementarities between regionalism and \nmultilateralism. Perhaps the best illustration of this point is a comparison with the PRC\u2019s \naccession to WTO. The benefits are expected to be substantial, mainly because the \nPRC has long remained relatively closed and isolated from the global community, but \nunlike the PRC, years of liberalization and opening up associated with participation in \nsubregional and regional initiatives means that a significant portion of the benefits have \nalready accrued to countries like Lao PDR and Viet Nam. Thus, although WTO \nmembership will unambiguously deliver net benefits to these countries, the benefits at \nthis stage will be largely incremental. \n \n\nConsidering this, the most significant benefit to Lao PDR and to Viet Nam from WTO \nmembership may well be a demonstration effect. WTO membership will signal to the rest \nof the trading world that these countries were able to meet a demanding set of \ninternational trade and investment rules and guidelines. The returns from strong \ndemonstration effects should not be underestimated because they can have a significant \nimpact on forging new trading relationships and attracting FDI. \n \n \nVI.  Summary and Conclusions \n \n\nIn this paper, we examined the inter-relationships between subregionalism, \n\nregionalism, and multilateralism using the GMS and AFTA as case studies.  In particular, \nwe looked at whether subregionalism or regionalism could assist a country in moving \ntowards multilateralism. We found that the GMS program is assisting its members to \nintegrate more closely with the ASEAN region and, through this, with the rest of the \nworld. As a program based on market rather than institutional integration, the GMS is \npromoting both regionalism and multilateralism.  The subregional public goods provided \nthrough the program are spilling over to become not only regional but also global.  \n \n\nNext we examined the relationship between regionalism and multilateralism.  If \n\nmembers pursue open regionalism and offer their trade and other preferences to \nnonmembers on a nondiscriminatory basis, then this is consistent with the principles and \nobjectives of multilateralism.  For the original ASEAN members, it has actually hastened \nthe speed at which these countries have moved towards their goal of free and open \ntrade because of the ambitious liberalization program that AFTA has committed them to.  \nThe newer ASEAN members should follow suit if they are going to maximize the benefits \nfrom the overall liberalization program as well as minimize the costs associated with \ntrade diversion and trade, production, and investment deflection.   \n\n\f \n\nEven if the newer members decide not to go this route, there are other ways in which \n\nregionalism is promoting multilateralism. Increasing integration with the original ASEAN \ncountries will provide the GMS economies with a conduit to the outside world because \nthe original members conduct most of their trade and investment extra-regionally. The \nstrategic location of the GMS also provides opportunities for integration beyond the \nregion. Location between the burgeoning economies of the PRC and India in particular \npresents great potential to boost trade, tourism, and investment.  Finally, since both \nsubregionalism and regionalism can actually contribute to multilateralism, is there still \nany basis for countries such as Lao PDR and Viet Nam to pursue WTO membership? \nThe answer is still a definite yes, although the net impact will now be necessarily smaller \ngiven the benefits that subregionalism and regionalism have delivered. Perhaps the \nmost significant benefit to Lao PDR and Viet Nam from WTO membership may now be \nin the form of demonstration effects. \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n \nConcerns over Open Regionalism: Competitive and Revenue Effects \n \n\nSome major concerns of the GMS economies about multilateralizing tariff \npreferences relate to perceived negative impacts on domestic production and \ngovernment tariff revenue collection. The fear for domestic production is that if \nliberalization were to proceed multilaterally rather than regionally, a flood of imports \nmight wipe out some industries. It is often argued that a number of industries in the \ntransitional economies of the GMS are infant industries requiring protection for survival, \nbut this issue relates to protectionism, not to whether liberalization should be preferential \nor multilateral once the decision has been made to liberalize. If grounds for protection \nbased on the infant industry argument are valid, then such an industry should be \nquarantined from both preferential and multilateral liberalization until it has developed \nsufficiently to survive without protection. AFTA provides for a more gradual phasing in of \ntariff reductions for such industries by allowing them to be placed on the temporary \nexclusion and sensitive lists. For other industries, there is no reason to fear multilateral \nliberalization; on the contrary, it ensures that consumer welfare is maximized by enabling \nimports to be sourced internationally from the lowest-cost producer. So multilateralizing \npreferences should not jeopardize production of so-called sensitive industries in these \neconomies because all that is being recommended is uniformity in provision of tariff \nreductions to all trading partners with no change in the time frame of liberalization \nschedules or in the range of products covered. \n \n\nAnother major concern about multilateral tariff reductions is that they might further \n\nerode revenue from trade taxes associated with AFTA-based trade liberalization. In \nother words, it is expected that a two-tier tariff rate\u2014a CEPT rate for the intra-ASEAN \nproducer and a higher MFN rate for extra-ASEAN producers\u2014will mitigate total revenue \nloss somewhat. A significant difference between the two rates would, however, create a \nstrong incentive for trade deflection. This would simply result in revenue being lost \naltogether to the member country with the lowest external tariff, which in this case is \nmost likely Singapore. In short, if trade deflection occurs as a result of the dual tariff \nsystem, then tariff revenue collected by the importing country could actually be lower \nthan if the tariff reductions were multilateral. \n \n\nApart from this, maintaining a system whereby two rates apply to each (if not most) \ntariff lines also increases the potential for rent-seeking behavior. It is an open secret that \nsome portion of revenue associated with trade taxes is collected privately rather than \npublicly. This is reflected in the high estimates of the share of informal cross-border \ntrade in the GMS. A higher MFN rate compared with the CEPT rate will provide a new \navenue through which private rents are extracted with little or no change to public \ncustoms revenue collection. Indeed, reducing tariffs would remove some of the incentive \nfor smuggling thereby increasing the share of total trade subject to tariffs. For these \nreasons, concerns about potential revenue loss should not stand in the way of these \neconomies multilateralizing their CEPT tariffs and offering them to all trading partners on \na nondiscriminatory MFN basis.  \n\n\fReferences \n \nADB. 2004.

Introduction \n \n", "The last two decades have witnessed a proliferation of formal regional trading \narrangements (RTAs) mostly in the form of free trade areas (FTAs). There is strong \ndemand to form or to join RTAs on political grounds.  As Bhagwati (1997) puts it, \u201cNo \npolitician is happy unless he has put his signature on at least one of them.\u201d There is also \nan apparently strong compulsion to avoid being an outsider on economic grounds.1  As \nfar back as 1964, Robert Mundell demonstrated how trading partners who do not join a \npreferential trading arrangement might be made worse off (through terms of trade \neffects)2 even when global welfare is enhanced. Even in the absence of terms of trade \neffects, the fact that an outsider\u2019s competitors may have negotiated preferential access \nto its major markets suggests that the costs of not joining could be high.  The threat of \ntrade and investment diversion is viewed as a compelling reason to seek membership in \nRTAs (Lawrence1996). \n \n", "More recently, however, there has been significant interest in less formal \narrangements sometimes referred to as growth triangles or quadrangles or more \ngenerally as subregionalism.3 Every member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) \ntoday is also a member of at least one subregional or regional cooperation arrangement, \nmany are members of both, and some are even members of multiples of each.  This is \nsometimes referred to as the \u201dspaghetti bowl\u201d effect (Bhagwati 1993).  \n \n", "In light of these developments, it is pertinent to ask the question, what are the inter-\n", "relationships between subregionalism, regionalism, and multilateralism?  Apart from the \ninter-relationships, it is also interesting to consider the conditions under which \nsubregionalism or regionalism can assist a country in moving towards multilateralism. \nPut a different way; is there anything that countries can do to ensure that their \nmembership in subregional or regional cooperation arrangements will act as building \nrather than stumbling blocks towards free and open trade and investment? The \nrelevance of this question is rooted in the fact that, in economic terms, preferential trade \nliberalization will always be inferior to nondiscriminatory or multilateral tariff reductions.4 \nThus, if subregionalism or regionalism can help move a country towards multilateralism, \nthen it is working in the right direction. \n \n", "In answering these questions, we use the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) \n", "cooperation arrangement to represent subregionalism and the Association of Southeast \n", "                                                 \n1   As  of  1994,  all  but  3  of  the  128  members  of  the  General  Agreement  on  Trade  and  Tariffs  were  also \nmembers  of  at  least  one  RTA  (see  Sampson  1996).    Hong  Kong,  China;  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina;  Japan;  and  the  Republic  of  Korea  were  the  exceptions,  but  the  latter  two  have  negotiated \nbilateral trade agreements since then. If the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation initiative is included as \nan RTA, then there are no exceptions.  \n", "2   This occurs when the preferential arrangement is large enough to affect world prices, and outsiders as a \n", "whole are harmed because their terms of trade deteriorate as a result of trade diversion. \n", "3   There has also been a sharp increase in the number of bilateral trading arrangements of late, most of \nwhich are quite formal and comprehensive and as such are treated here like any other regional FTA. \n4   As Cooper and Massell (1965) have shown, a nondiscriminatory tariff reduction will enable a country to \nenjoy  trade  creation  without  any  trade  diversion.  Furthermore,  the  extent  of  trade  creation  under \nmultilateral  liberalization  would  be  either  equal  to  or  greater  than  that  possible  within  a  preferential \ntrading arrangement. The extent of trade creation under multilateral liberalization would be greater than \nthat  possible  with  preferential  liberalization  if  the  lowest-cost  producer  lies  outside  the  grouping  and \nwould be equal to it if the lowest-cost producer were a member. \n"]}
