INTRODUCTION \nThe electrification of transportation (or electric mobility) appears to be the mainstream or \na game changer in road transport. Many countries of the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) are promoting the electrification of road transportation or electric \nmobility.  Mainly  economic  and  energy-related  benefits  drive  this  interest,  but  the \nconsequences of electric mobility could extend beyond the economic and energy-related \nbenefits.  The  reduction  of  primary  energy  consumption  due  to  higher  levels  \nof electric mobility will result in the reduction of air pollutants, such as carbon dioxide  \nor  sulfur  oxide  emissions,  which  in  turn  will  improve  the  air  quality  in  the  urban \nenvironment. The electrification of transportation such as buses can reduce the amount \nof carbon dioxide emissions by 1 million tons per year (Li and Chang 2019). \nPeople consider energy insecurity a way of verifying the relationship between energy, \nthe built environment, and health in relation to climate change (Hernandez 2013, 2016). \nLower access to energy causes deterioration of the built environment, which in turn has \nsignificant negative repercussions for health or public health. The higher the level of \nelectric mobility penetration is, the lower the level of pollutant emissions is. If all other \nthings are equal, a lower level of pollutant emissions means an improvement in the urban \nair quality. \nThe National Development and Reform Committee (NDRC) in the People\u2019s Republic  \nof China (PRC) circulated draft Administrative Rules on Auto Industry Investment on  \n17 May 2018. The draft rules aim to reduce investments in internal combustion engine-\ndriven vehicles and boost investments in electric vehicles. Once fully enacted, the draft \nrules  will  encourage  investment  in  and  promote  technological  progress  in  electric \nvehicles, among others. \nThe electrification of road transport not only facilitates more mobilization but reduces \nurban air pollution, as it decreases tailpipe pollution provided that renewable energy \naccounts for a substantial share of the electricity generation. Early adoption of electric \nvehicles seems to be possible, but little research has examined how this will affect the \nenergy and environmental sphere in the ASEAN (Li and Chang 2019).  \nElectric  vehicles  (EVs) can  solve  transport  problems and  spearhead  technological \ndominance,  especially  in  transportation  technologies.  The  so-called  EV  drive  in  \nthe  PRC  is  a  good  example  of  the  effort  to  become  a  technological  pioneer.  \nOther examples are the developing technologies of autonomous driving or artificial \nintelligence that many tech firms, such as Google, Amazon, Apple, and Tesla, are \npursuing. \nUsing the projections of EVs and the electrification of road transport (e.g., Li and Chang \n2019), this study aims to show how electric mobility affects the urban air quality in the \nASEAN and alleviates the consequences of energy insecurity. It also aims to determine \nhow the integration of renewable energy into the power grid affects the urban air quality \nand mitigates the negative consequences of energy insecurity. \nThe remainder of the study proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the relationship \nbetween energy use, urban air quality, and health and explains the choice of sulfur oxides \nas a proxy indicator for urban air quality to examine the possible relationship between \nenergy insecurity and health. Section 3 shows the status of and projected figures for road \nelectrification in the ASEAN. Following this, section 4 describes how electric mobility \naffects primary energy consumption in the ASEAN countries. Section 5 examines the \nmain theme of this study, whether and how electric mobility improves the urban air \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1025  Chang and Li \n \nquality, taking the level of sulfur dioxide emissions as an indicator of energy insecurity \nrepresenting the nature of public health. Section 6 concludes this study.  \n2.  ENERGY USE, URBAN AIR QUALITY,  \nAND IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH \nEnergy acts as an input for production in an economy. It enables the economy to function \nproperly and grow. At the same time, the use of energy produces pollutants as by-\nproducts, such as particular matter 10 micron (PM ), particular matter 2.5 micron (PM ), \n10 2.5\nnitrogen oxide (NO ), ozone (O ), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO ), and \n2 3 2\nsulfur oxides (SO ), among others. This is how the energy use affects the urban air \n2\nquality. The greater the use of energy, the larger the amounts of air pollutants emitted. \nThe emitted air pollutants stay in the atmosphere for a while, increase the concentration \nlevel of the pollutants, and eventually affect the health of the inhabitants in the economy. \nThe characteristics, sources, concentrations, and behavior of these pollutants in the \natmosphere are the key subjects of urban air pollution-related studies (e.g., Barkley et \nal. 2017; Hasan et al. 2014; Hosamane and Desai 2013; Khan et al. 2017; Mansouri, \nHoshyari, and Mansouri 2011; Nikolic et al. 2010; Szyda et al. 2009; Xiao et al. 2018) \nalong with ways to improve the urban air quality (Buckley and Mitchell 2011; Nowak, \nCrane, and Stevens 2006). These studies have presented the key sources of air \npollutants and the trend of air quality in urban areas, among others. The level of SO  in \n2\nthe  atmosphere  is  apparently  highly  correlated  with  the  heating  season  in  Seoul, \nRepublic of Korea (Khan et al. 2017), in Chengdu, PRC (Xiao et al. 2018), and in Shiraz, \nIran (Mansouri et al. 2011) and with coal production and traffic intensity in Poland (Szyda \net al. 2009). \nThere are prolific studies on regional urban air quality (e.g., Alpopi and Colesca 2010; \nEuropean  Environmental  Agency  (EEA)  n.d.;  International  Gas  Union  2016).  A \ncomparative study of urban air quality in European capital cities presented the steel \nindustry, oil refining, motor vehicles, and power generation as the key sources of  \nSO  (Alpopi and Colesca 2010). Power generation and domestic dwellings are the major \n2\nstationary sources of SO  in Europe (EEA n.d.). Urban air pollution, however, may not \n2\nhurt the economy much if it makes extensive use of a cleaner fossil fuel, such as natural \ngas, rather than coal in power generation and heating (International Gas Union 2016).  \nUrban air pollution is one of the main threats to health at the global scale (International \nGas Union 2016; WHO 2000, 2005). Whether and how urban air pollution affects health \nin an economy have been the subject of extensive studies (e.g., International Energy \nAgency 2016; Kosan et al. 2018; Perera 2018; Prescott et al. 1998; Qin et al. 2017; World \nResources Institute 1988). Urban air pollutants, such as particulate matters, sulfur \ndioxides, and ozone, appear to pose serious health damage and risks (World Resources \nInstitute 1998). There seems to be a statistically significant and strong association \nbetween urban air pollution and cardiac and pulmonary disease (Prescott et al. 1998). A \nstudy has pointed out pollutants from the combustion of fossil fuels as a leading \nenvironmental threat to children\u2019s health and their future at the global scale (Perera \n2018). The development of a new energy source, such as synthetic natural gas in the \nPRC, however, appears to benefit the households with the smallest carbon footprints \n(Qin et al. 2017).  \n \nResearchers  understand  the  level  of  SO   concentration  in  the  atmosphere  has  a  \n2\nstrong correlation with urban transport (e.g., Afif et al. 2008; Ilyas 2007). A study has \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1025  Chang and Li \n \nhighlighted long-range transport as the key source in the variation of SO  concentration \n2\nin Beirut (Afif et al. 2008), and there is a belief that air pollutants from motor vehicles are \nthe main contributor to urban air pollution in Pakistan (Ilyas 2007).  \nThere is a strong positive relationship between energy use and air pollution levels (e.g., \nADB 2006; International Energy Agency 2016; National Academy of Engineering and \nNational  Research  Council  2008;  Wuebbles  and  Sanyal  2015).  \nA cleaner energy world is a possible solution to improve the air quality and climate \nchange (Wuebbles and Sanyal 2015). Another stream of research on the relationship \nbetween  energy  use  and  air  pollution  has  indicated  that  the poor  air  quality  due  \nto energy use, such as haze, appears to hinder the performance of photovoltaics (Peters \net al. 2018). \nThe analysis of the effect of electrifying vehicles and equipment on urban air quality \npresents  a  modest  impact  of  electrification  on  the  urban  air  quality  in  the  US \n(Nopmongcol et al. 2017). The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) or plug-in electric \nvehicles (PEVs) is likely to decrease air pollutants. The exact level of the contribution is \ndependent on how electricity is generated, where it is generated, and how people use \nthe vehicles, but the current grid specification may cause the level of SO  emissions in \n2\nTexas to increase (Nichols, Kockelman, and Reiter 2015). \nAmong various air pollutants, sulfur oxides (SO ) are one of the main urban air pollutants. \n2\nTransportation and power generation that uses fossil fuels are pointed out as the main \nsources of SO . As a way of decreasing SO  emissions, the PRC has explored a trading \n2 2\nscheme for SO  emissions (Yang and Schreifels 2003) and is implementing it across the \n2\nPRC. \nThis study takes sulfur oxides as a proxy indicator of the urban air quality. The following \nsections present the way in which electro mobility in the ASEAN countries changes the \nfuel mix of power generation and the number of various types of vehicles, including \nelectric  vehicles.  Using  the  forecast  numbers  of  all  vehicles  and  primary  energy \nconsumption in 2040, this study investigates whether and how electric mobility improves \nthe urban air quality and alleviates the negative consequences of energy insecurity as \nwell as suggesting policy implications for decreasing energy insecurity.  \n3.  ELECTRIFICATION OF THE ROAD TRANSPORT \nSECTOR IN THE ASEAN: OUTLOOK IN 2040 \nThe ASEAN countries are expected to achieve the electrification of road transport by \nadopting appropriate policies (Li and Chang 2019). Changes in the primary energy \nconsumption and the emissions of air pollutants, such as carbon dioxide or sulfur dioxide, \nwill realize the possible impacts of such a transition. \nThe  statistics  of  the  transport  sector  in  the  ASEAN  countries  suggest  how  the \nelectrification of the road transport sector affects the dependence on fossil fuel imports \nin these countries. As the transport sector typically accounts for 30% or more of the total \nprimary energy consumption in the ASEAN countries, the expectation is that the impacts \nwill be significant (Li and Chang 2019).  \n   \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1025  Chang and Li \n \nThis study adopts the baseline scenario of the road transport sector in the ASEAN in \n2040 that Li and Chang (2019) developed. The baseline scenario reflects various \ntransport-related and economics-related data. These include the number of vehicle \nfleets, fuel consumption by road transport, fuel economy of various fleets, including \nelectric vehicles, and fuel mix of power generation, which are transport related. Other \ndata included are the outlook for the future economy and energy consumption, the fuel \nmix of the power sector, changes in the share of fleets in the total vehicle population and \nthe amount of vehicle ownership, the outlook of the road transport sector in the ASEAN, \nincluding the number of vehicles in various fleets, and the corresponding level of fuel \nconsumption. \nFollowing the baseline scenario, the study adopts four scenarios to analyze the impact \nof introducing electric vehicles, together with other possible policies, such as aggressive \nfuel  economy  policies  for  both  fossil  fuel-based  and  conventional  vehicles  and \naggressive policies toward cleaner power generation in the power sector. Table 1 shows \nthe four scenarios with brief descriptions. \nTable 1: Scenario Definition \nScenarios  Definitions \n2040 BAU  Baseline projections on vehicle numbers and fuel consumption \n2040 EV10  10% of the projected number of vehicles are EVs \n2040 EV30  30% of the projected number of vehicles are EVs \n2040 EV10 + FE  10% of the projected number of vehicles are EVs + aggressive fuel \neconomy standards \n2040 EV30 + FE  30% of the projected number of vehicles are EVs + aggressive fuel \neconomy standards \nSource: Li and Chang (2019). \nDue to the deep penetration of EVs into the vehicle population in the future, the road \ntransport sector needs strong support from the power generation sector. To capture  \nthe  feedback  between  the  two  sectors,  the  scenarios  include  two  sets  of  policy \nalternatives so that they can reflect the possible impacts of the policies on the fuel mix in \nthe  power  generation.  The  study  applies  a  set  of  power  sector  alternative  policy \nscenarios (APSs) to the abovementioned scenarios. The APSs will presumably make \nthe power generation cleaner or greener. The APS case states the target of an annual \nimprovement of 3.7% in a fuel economy and in turn its achievement between 2015 and \n2030 (GFEI and IEA 2017).  \nThe GFEI and IEA report shows, however, that non-OECD countries achieved an annual \nimprovement of 0.8% in the fuel economy during the period from 2005 to 2015, while \nOECD countries experienced an annual improvement of 1.8% during the same period. \nThe fuel improvement in the BAU scenario is hence assumed to be 0.8% until 2030 and \nthe same for the period from 2030 to 2040. The study applied the non-OECD rate of \n0.8% to all the countries except for Brunei Darussalam and Singapore and the OECD \nrate of 1.8% to Brunei Darussalam and Singapore. \nIt is worth noting that the data relating to the number of vehicle fleets in the ASEAN  \nand the level of corresponding fuel consumption are highly fragmented. Therefore, even \nthe best effort to collect data from various sources, such as the literature, public \ndatabases, government reports, and news reports, has left room for improvement in data \ncollection. Better data could make the best available estimation possible. \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1025  Chang and Li \n \nTable 2 presents the number of vehicles in various fleets in the ASEAN countries in 2015, \nwhile Table 3 presents the estimated fuel consumption levels in 2015. \nTable 2: Number of Vehicles in Various Fleets in the ASEAN Countries in 2015  \n(Unit: Thousand) \n \nBru  Cam  Indo  Lao  Mal \nPassenger Cars  277.02  28.28  13,480.97  5.18  12,180.29 \nTrucks  20.29  6.84  6,611.03  55.72  1,177.44 \nBuses  2.37  0.44  2,420.92  63.01  72.49 \nMotorcycles  6.83  326.78  98,881.27  1,531.97  12,289.03 \nTotal  306.51  362.34  121,394.19  1,655.88  25,719.25 \n \nMya  Phil  Sing  Thai  Viet \nPassenger Cars  521.08  4,037.07  604.72  13,290.47  971.93 \nTrucks  214.26  24.68  162.18  982.70  870.32 \nBuses  30.43  28.80  17.74  142.86  157.75 \nMotorcycles  5,276.68  4,616.06  143.90  20,395.93  45,164.71 \nTotal  6,042.45  8,706.61  928.54  34,811.97  47,164.71 \nSource: Li and Chang (2019). \nTable 3: Fuel Consumption in the Road Transport Sector in the ASEAN in 2015  \n(Unit: Liter) \n \nBru  Cam  Indo  Lao  Mal \nPassenger Cars  424,635,527.7  20,574,918  8,796,550,000  3,417,540  14,470,200,50\n0 \nTrucks  91,569,160.12  14,660,379.24  12,179,986,43 108,204,595  4,118,882,720 \n9 \nBuses  35,482,894.34  3,438,411.53  19,018,022,23 521,306,740  1,270,042,254 \n1 \nMotorcycles  3,630,345.73  79,298,376.05  21,330,889,69 336,945,481  5,197,872,767 \n5 \nTotal (Mtoe)  0.47  0.10  53.83  0.86  21.36 \n \nMya  Phil  Sing  Thai  Viet \nPassenger Cars  340,924,500  6,574,974,714  983,136,000  14,367,700,47 638,251,086.2 \n1 \nTrucks  412,789,539  118,355,056.2  761,330,957  3,128,201,737  1,682,920,994 \nBuses  323,330,408  761,600,000  440,657,053  2,191,210,856  1,351,522,097 \nMotorcycles  1,151,368,711  2,276,687,314  79,671,837.8  7,261,453,351  9,505,862,419 \nTotal (Mtoe)  1.92  8.19  1.99  22.93  11.25 \nSource: Li and Chang (2019). \nTable 4 presents the status of power generation in the ASEAN power sector as of 2015. \nIt is worth noting that the fuel mix in the power sector and the conversion efficiency \nappear to affect the analysis of EV penetration significantly. \nFour main factors appear to determine the number of vehicle fleets in the ASEAN \ncountries by 2040.

ELECTRIC MOBILITY AND ENERGY CONSUMPTION \nIN ASEAN COUNTRIES \nThe projection shows that there will be significant increases in the level of final energy \nconsumption in the ASEAN countries by all types of fleets, such as passenger cars, \ntrucks, buses, and motorcycles. As electric vehicles penetrate into the fleets, the degree \nof reduction in the level of final energy consumption will be drastic. Figure 1 presents the \nlevel of final energy consumption by fleets and scenarios in 2040 in the ASEAN countries.  \nFigure 1: The Level of Final Energy Consumption by Fleets and Scenarios  \nin the ASEAN Countries in 2040  \n(Unit: Mtoe) \n \nSource: Li and Chang (2019). \n \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1025  Chang and Li \n \nCombining the effects of the introduction of EVs and higher fuel efficiency, the ASEAN \nanticipates a possible future with a lower level of final energy consumption in the road \ntransport sector, which the APS with 30% of EV penetration shows. The introduction of \nEVs into the road transport sector typically proceeds by combining the road transport \nand  the  power  sector.  When  considering  the  level  of  primary  fossil  fuel  energy \nconsumption in the power sector, the penetration of EVs actually may not contribute \nmuch  to  reducing  the  level  of  primary  energy  consumption  if  thermal  power  still \ndominates the power generation in the ASEAN countries by 2040. A higher penetration \nrate of EVs and a higher level of primary energy consumption in the road transport sector \nwould be the case.  \nSuch a finding is not surprising for two reasons. First, although an EV power train \nintrinsically has a high level of performance in fuel economy, the low efficiency of thermal \npower generation will mostly erode such an advantage if thermal power dominates the \npower sector. Second, the fuel economy of conventional vehicles in the BAU scenario is \nlikely to improve by about 30%. In the APS scenarios, the fuel economy can improve by \nas much as 70% or more. Further application of conventional vehicles with improved fuel \neconomy will actually contribute to a lower level of primary energy consumption than EVs \n(Li and Chang 2019). \nThe  last  two  scenarios  provide  other  interesting  observations.  The  aggressive \nimplementation  of  fuel  economy  in  the  ASEAN  countries  appears  to  promote  EV \npenetration (Li and Chang 2019). The level of primary energy consumption in the road \ntransport sector seems to be improving significantly, and the aggressive fuel economy \nappears to be the main driver. Figure 2 presents the level of consumption of fossil energy \nby scenarios in 2040 in the ASEAN. It shows that the AP case integrates renewable \nenergy aggressively into the power sector. In the case of 30% penetration of EVs, the \nlevel of primary energy consumption will be higher than with only 10% of EV penetration \nfor two reasons. First, in terms of energy efficiency, aggressive fuel economy results in \na higher level of energy efficiency than EVs, so more EVs mean a higher level of primary \nenergy consumption if all other things are equal. Second, EVs obtain their energy from \na power grid, and fossil fuel-fired generation, such as coal and natural gas, still dominates \nthe power grid. In such a case, higher losses in the conversion process of fossil fuels \ninto electricity further erode the level of well-to-wheel energy efficiency of EVs.  \nHaving  noticed  such  a  contradictory  case,  in  which  the  level  of  primary  energy \nconsumption is increasing rather than decreasing, it would be interesting to examine \nwhat will happen if aggressive policies increase the integration of renewables into the \npower  sector.  The  ASEAN  will  implement  the  policies  by  2040,  when  the  power \ngeneration sector in the ASEAN follows the assumptions that the APS scenario of  \nthe power sector outlook presents according to the Economic Research Institute for \nASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) (2016). With the adoption of aggressive policies to improve \nthe integration of renewables into the power sector of the ASEAN, the penetration of EVs \nwill help to reduce the level of primary energy consumption in the ASEAN\u2019s road transport \nsector. First, without the achievement of the aggressive fuel economy in the ASEAN, the \n30%  penetration  of  EV  appears  to  be  the  best  policy  target.  Second,  with  the \nachievement of the aggressive fuel economy in the ASEAN, only the penetration level of \n10%  appears  to  be  the  ideal  level  for  the  penetration  \nof EVs. \n \nFigure 2: Fossil Energy Consumption by Scenarios in 2040 in ASEAN  \n(Unit: Mtoe) \n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1025  Chang and Li \n \n \nSource: Li and Chang (2019). \nThe introduction of EVs into the ASEAN countries appears to make the ASEAN\u2019s  \nfinal energy consumption in the road transport sector decrease significantly in the \nalternative scenarios of 2040 compared with the BAU scenario of 2040. However, taking \ninto consideration the level of primary energy consumption in the power sector to charge \nEVs, the level of primary energy consumption in the ASEAN\u2019s road transport sector \nactually appears to be higher than that in the BAU scenario of 2040. This is mainly \ncaused by the expectation that fossil fuels will generate a majority of the electricity in the \nASEAN and that there will be huge losses during the conversion process from fossil fuels \ninto electricity (Li and Chang 2019). When considering the large-scale introduction of \nEVs into the ASEAN countries\u2019 road transport sector, the large-scale introduction of \nrenewables should either precede EVs or at least occur simultaneously with EVs. It is \nworth  noting  that,  due  to  the  lack  of  availability  of  data,  this  study  makes many \nassumptions. Such assumptions need further testing or the building of sub-models to \nincorporate those assumptions to obtain more accurate estimations in future studies. \n5.  ELECTRO MOBILITY AND THE URBAN AIR QUALITY \nWhen implementing the electrification of the road transport sector in the ASEAN, the \nlevel  of  primary  energy  consumption  appears  to  decrease  under  aggressive APS \nscenarios. Taking SO  emissions as an indicator of the urban air quality, this study shows \n2\nhow the electrification of the road transport sector could affect the urban air quality in the \nASEAN in 2040. \nFigure 3 presents the level of SO  emissions in 2040 by scenarios. As expected, the no-\n2\nEV case shows that the urban air quality in 2040 could be far worse than in 2015 as the \nexpectation is that the level of SO  emissions will actually increase. The cases of 10% \n2\nEVs and 30% EVs appear not to improve the urban air quality either, as the higher level \nof electrification in the road transport sector is likely to drive the level of primary energy \nconsumption to increase. Electricity generated from fossil fuel sources can meet the \nhigher demand for electricity due to the higher penetration of electric mobility, eventually \nincreasing the primary energy consumption.  \nWith the implementation of an aggressive fuel mix policy for power generation with 10% \npenetration of electric mobility, as the scenario of \u201cFE plus 10% EV\u201d shows, the urban \nair quality in 2040 can be better than that in 2015. With an aggressive fuel mix policy and \n12 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1025  Chang and Li \n \n30% penetration of electric mobility, as the scenario of \u201cFE plus 30% EV\u201d shows, the \nurban air quality can be far better than in 2015.  \nFigure 3: Sulfur Dioxide (SO ) Emissions by Scenarios  \n2\n(Unit: Tons) \n \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \nThe penetration of electric vehicles contributes to lower SO  emissions, and higher  \n2\nfuel efficiency standards seem to contribute even more. In addition, if countries introduce \nmore renewable energy into the power generation sector, SO emissions will fall far \n2 \nmore.  \nApart from the economic and energy-related benefits, people expect electric mobility to \nbring environmental benefits, such as improvements in the urban air quality. The current \nstudy, however, shows that achieving such environmental improvements with electric \nmobility alone appears to be very difficult. It suggests that a more aggressive policy \ntoward the fuel mix in power generation is necessary, together with an electric mobility \npolicy. \n6.  CONCLUSION \nThis study links energy insecurity to public health through the analysis of the changes in \nurban air quality due to the penetration of electric mobility in the ASEAN countries in \n2040. It finds that electric mobility can decrease the primary energy consumption in \nrelation to sulfur dioxide emissions from vehicles and power generation. \nIt calculates the amount of sulfur dioxides by scenarios and finds that two scenarios with \nan aggressive fuel mix policy for power generation will decrease sulfur dioxide emissions \ncompared with the no EV scenario and even 2015. This indicates that electric mobility \n(but only with an aggressive fuel mix policy for power generation) can alleviate the status \nof energy insecurity by improving the urban air quality. \nThe high penetration of electric mobility in the ASEAN countries can decrease the level \nof final energy consumption compared with the case of no electric mobility. For the level \nof primary energy consumption, however, electric mobility alone will not bring much of a \ndecrease. Implementing electric mobility with an aggressive fuel mix policy for power \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1025  Chang and Li \n \ngeneration appears to decrease the level of primary energy consumption compared with \nthe no electric mobility scenario, and it could be lower than the base case scenario.  \nThe study understands energy insecurity in the framework verifying the consequences \nof less access to energy for public health. Electric mobility can improve the urban air \nquality by decreasing the amount of harmful air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxides. High \npenetration of electric mobility with an aggressive fuel mix policy for power generation, \nas shown in the scenario of \u201cFE+30% EV\u201d in 2040, can decrease the amount of sulfur \ndioxides emitted in cities so that the urban air quality improves, in turn alleviating the \nproblem of energy insecurity.  \n \n   \n14 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1025  Chang and Li \n \nREFERENCES \nAfif, C., C.

The level of primary energy consumption, however, may not decrease unless countries adopt aggressive policies toward the integration of renewable energy into electricity generation. We present the consequences of the electrification of road transport in the ASEAN in terms of various energy dimensions, namely primary and final energy consumption, the integration of renewable energy, the importing of fossil fuels, and the levels of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions. Taking the emissions of sulfur dioxides as an indicator of the urban air quality, we investigate whether and how the electrification of road transport helps to enhance the status of energy insecurity by improving the urban air quality. Our findings suggest the need to implement an aggressive fuel mix policy for electricity generation with a strong drive for electric mobility.", "Title": "Electric Vehicles and Energy Insecurity in ASEAN Countries: Renewable Energy Integration and Urban Air Quality"}}
