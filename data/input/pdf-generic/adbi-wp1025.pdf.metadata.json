INTRODUCTION \n\nChang and Li \n\nThe electrification of transportation (or electric mobility) appears to be the mainstream or \na game changer in road transport. Many countries of the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations  (ASEAN)  are  promoting  the  electrification  of  road  transportation  or  electric \nmobility.  Mainly  economic  and  energy-related  benefits  drive  this  interest,  but  the \nconsequences of electric mobility could extend beyond the economic and energy-related \nbenefits.  The  reduction  of  primary  energy  consumption  due  to  higher  levels  \nof electric mobility will result in the  reduction of air pollutants, such as carbon dioxide  \nor  sulfur  oxide  emissions,  which  in  turn  will  improve  the  air  quality  in  the  urban \nenvironment. The electrification of transportation such as buses can reduce the amount \nof carbon dioxide emissions by 1 million tons per year (Li and Chang 2019). \n\nPeople consider energy insecurity a way of verifying the relationship between energy, \nthe built environment, and health in relation to climate change (Hernandez 2013, 2016). \nLower access to energy causes deterioration of the built environment, which in turn has \nsignificant  negative  repercussions  for  health  or  public  health.  The  higher  the  level  of \nelectric mobility penetration is, the lower the level of pollutant emissions is. If all other \nthings are equal, a lower level of pollutant emissions means an improvement in the urban \nair quality. \n\nThe  National  Development  and  Reform  Committee  (NDRC)  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  \nof  China  (PRC)  circulated  draft  Administrative  Rules  on  Auto  Industry  Investment  on  \n17 May 2018. The draft rules aim to reduce investments in internal combustion engine-\ndriven vehicles and boost investments in electric vehicles. Once fully enacted, the draft \nrules  will  encourage  investment  in  and  promote  technological  progress  in  electric \nvehicles, among others. \n\nThe  electrification  of  road  transport  not  only  facilitates  more  mobilization  but  reduces \nurban  air  pollution,  as  it  decreases  tailpipe  pollution  provided  that  renewable  energy \naccounts for a substantial share of the electricity generation. Early adoption of electric \nvehicles seems to be possible, but little research has examined how this will affect the \nenergy and environmental sphere in the ASEAN (Li and Chang 2019).  \n\nElectric  vehicles  (EVs)  can  solve  transport  problems  and  spearhead  technological \ndominance,  especially  in  transportation  technologies.  The  so-called  EV  drive  in  \nthe  PRC  is  a  good  example  of  the  effort  to  become  a  technological  pioneer.  \nOther  examples  are  the  developing  technologies  of  autonomous  driving  or  artificial \nintelligence  that  many  tech  firms,  such  as  Google,  Amazon,  Apple,  and  Tesla,  are \npursuing. \n\nUsing the projections of EVs and the electrification of road transport (e.g., Li and Chang \n2019), this study aims to show how electric mobility affects the urban air quality in the \nASEAN and alleviates the consequences of energy insecurity. It also aims to determine \nhow the integration of renewable energy into the power grid affects the urban air quality \nand mitigates the negative consequences of energy insecurity. \n\nThe  remainder  of  the  study  proceeds  as  follows.  Section  2  presents  the  relationship \nbetween energy use, urban air quality, and health and explains the choice of sulfur oxides \nas a proxy indicator for urban air quality to examine the possible relationship between \nenergy insecurity and health. Section 3 shows the status of and projected figures for road \nelectrification  in  the  ASEAN.  Following  this,  section  4  describes  how  electric  mobility \naffects  primary  energy consumption  in  the  ASEAN  countries.  Section  5 examines  the \nmain  theme  of  this  study,  whether  and  how  electric  mobility  improves  the  urban  air \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1025 \n \n\nChang and Li \n\nquality, taking the level of sulfur dioxide emissions as an indicator of energy insecurity \nrepresenting the nature of public health. Section 6 concludes this study.  \n\n2.  ENERGY USE, URBAN AIR QUALITY,  \nAND IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH \n\nEnergy acts as an input for production in an economy. It enables the economy to function \nproperly  and  grow.  At  the  same  time,  the  use  of  energy  produces  pollutants  as  by-\nproducts, such as particular matter 10 micron (PM10), particular matter 2.5 micron (PM2.5), \nnitrogen  oxide  (NO2),  ozone  (O3),  carbon  monoxide  (CO),  carbon  dioxide  (CO2),  and \nsulfur  oxides  (SO2),  among  others.  This  is  how  the  energy  use  affects  the  urban  air \nquality. The greater the use of energy, the larger the amounts of air pollutants emitted. \nThe emitted air pollutants stay in the atmosphere for a while, increase the concentration \nlevel of the pollutants, and eventually affect the health of the inhabitants in the economy. \n\nThe  characteristics,  sources,  concentrations,  and  behavior  of  these  pollutants  in  the \natmosphere are the key subjects of urban air pollution-related studies (e.g., Barkley et \nal. 2017; Hasan et al. 2014; Hosamane and Desai 2013; Khan et al. 2017; Mansouri, \nHoshyari, and Mansouri 2011; Nikolic et al. 2010; Szyda et al. 2009; Xiao et al. 2018) \nalong  with  ways  to  improve  the  urban  air  quality  (Buckley  and  Mitchell  2011;  Nowak, \nCrane,  and  Stevens  2006).  These  studies  have  presented  the  key  sources  of  air \npollutants and the trend of air quality in urban areas, among others. The level of SO2 in \nthe  atmosphere  is  apparently  highly  correlated  with  the  heating  season  in  Seoul, \nRepublic of Korea (Khan et al. 2017), in Chengdu, PRC (Xiao et al. 2018), and in Shiraz, \nIran (Mansouri et al. 2011) and with coal production and traffic intensity in Poland (Szyda \net al. 2009). \n\nThere are prolific studies on regional urban air quality (e.g., Alpopi and Colesca 2010; \nEuropean  Environmental  Agency  (EEA)  n.d.;  International  Gas  Union  2016).  A \ncomparative  study  of  urban  air  quality  in  European  capital  cities  presented  the  steel \nindustry,  oil  refining,  motor  vehicles,  and  power  generation  as  the  key  sources  of  \nSO2 (Alpopi and Colesca 2010). Power generation and domestic dwellings are the major \nstationary sources of SO2 in Europe (EEA n.d.). Urban air pollution, however, may not \nhurt the economy much if it makes extensive use of a cleaner fossil fuel, such as natural \ngas, rather than coal in power generation and heating (International Gas Union 2016).  \n\nUrban air pollution is one of the main threats to health at the global scale (International \nGas Union 2016; WHO 2000, 2005). Whether and how urban air pollution affects health \nin  an  economy  have been  the  subject  of  extensive  studies  (e.g.,  International  Energy \nAgency 2016; Kosan et al. 2018; Perera 2018; Prescott et al. 1998; Qin et al. 2017; World \nResources  Institute  1988).  Urban  air  pollutants,  such  as  particulate  matters,  sulfur \ndioxides, and ozone, appear to pose serious health damage and risks (World Resources \nInstitute  1998).  There  seems  to  be  a  statistically  significant  and  strong  association \nbetween urban air pollution and cardiac and pulmonary disease (Prescott et al. 1998). A \nstudy  has  pointed  out  pollutants  from  the  combustion  of  fossil  fuels  as  a  leading \nenvironmental  threat  to  children\u2019s  health  and  their  future  at  the  global  scale  (Perera \n2018). The development of a new energy source, such as synthetic natural gas in the \nPRC,  however,  appears  to  benefit  the  households  with  the smallest  carbon  footprints \n(Qin et al. 2017).  \n\n \n\nResearchers  understand  the  level  of  SO2  concentration  in  the  atmosphere  has  a  \nstrong correlation with urban transport (e.g., Afif et al. 2008; Ilyas 2007). A study has \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1025 \n \n\nChang and Li \n\nhighlighted long-range transport as the key source in the variation of SO2 concentration \nin Beirut (Afif et al. 2008), and there is a belief that air pollutants from motor vehicles are \nthe main contributor to urban air pollution in Pakistan (Ilyas 2007).  \n\nResearch \n\nThere is a strong positive relationship between energy use and air pollution levels (e.g., \nADB  2006;  International  Energy  Agency  2016;  National  Academy  of  Engineering  and \nNational \n2015).  \nA  cleaner  energy  world  is  a  possible  solution  to  improve  the  air  quality  and  climate \nchange (Wuebbles and Sanyal 2015). Another stream of research on the relationship \nbetween  energy  use  and  air  pollution  has  indicated  that  the  poor  air  quality  due  \nto energy use, such as haze, appears to hinder the performance of photovoltaics (Peters \net al. 2018). \n\n2008;  Wuebbles \n\nCouncil \n\nSanyal \n\nand \n\nThe  analysis  of  the  effect  of  electrifying  vehicles  and  equipment  on  urban  air  quality \npresents  a  modest  impact  of  electrification  on  the  urban  air  quality  in  the  US \n(Nopmongcol  et  al.  2017).  The  adoption  of  electric  vehicles  (EVs)  or  plug-in  electric \nvehicles (PEVs) is likely to decrease air pollutants. The exact level of the contribution is \ndependent on how electricity is generated, where it is generated, and how people use \nthe vehicles, but the current grid specification may cause the level of SO2 emissions in \nTexas to increase (Nichols, Kockelman, and Reiter 2015). \n\nAmong various air pollutants, sulfur oxides (SO2) are one of the main urban air pollutants. \nTransportation and power generation that uses fossil fuels are pointed out as the main \nsources of SO2. As a way of decreasing SO2 emissions, the PRC has explored a trading \nscheme for SO2 emissions (Yang and Schreifels 2003) and is implementing it across the \nPRC. \n\nThis study takes sulfur oxides as a proxy indicator of the urban air quality. The following \nsections present the way in which electro mobility in the ASEAN countries changes the \nfuel  mix  of  power  generation  and  the  number  of  various  types  of  vehicles,  including \nelectric  vehicles.  Using  the  forecast  numbers  of  all  vehicles  and  primary  energy \nconsumption in 2040, this study investigates whether and how electric mobility improves \nthe urban air quality and alleviates the negative consequences of energy insecurity as \nwell as suggesting policy implications for decreasing energy insecurity.  \n\n3.  ELECTRIFICATION OF THE ROAD TRANSPORT \nSECTOR IN THE ASEAN: OUTLOOK IN 2040 \n\nThe  ASEAN countries  are  expected  to  achieve  the  electrification  of  road  transport  by \nadopting  appropriate  policies  (Li  and  Chang  2019).  Changes  in  the  primary  energy \nconsumption and the emissions of air pollutants, such as carbon dioxide or sulfur dioxide, \nwill realize the possible impacts of such a transition. \n\nThe  statistics  of  the  transport  sector  in  the  ASEAN  countries  suggest  how  the \nelectrification of the road transport sector affects the dependence on fossil fuel imports \nin these countries. As the transport sector typically accounts for 30% or more of the total \nprimary energy consumption in the ASEAN countries, the expectation is that the impacts \nwill be significant (Li and Chang 2019).  \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1025 \n \n\nChang and Li \n\nThis study adopts the baseline scenario of the road transport sector in the ASEAN in \n2040  that  Li  and  Chang  (2019)  developed.  The  baseline  scenario  reflects  various \ntransport-related  and  economics-related  data.  These  include  the  number  of  vehicle \nfleets,  fuel  consumption  by  road  transport,  fuel  economy  of  various  fleets,  including \nelectric vehicles, and fuel mix of power generation, which are transport related. Other \ndata included are the outlook for the future economy and energy consumption, the fuel \nmix of the power sector, changes in the share of fleets in the total vehicle population and \nthe amount of vehicle ownership, the outlook of the road transport sector in the ASEAN, \nincluding  the  number  of  vehicles  in  various  fleets,  and  the  corresponding  level of  fuel \nconsumption. \n\nFollowing the baseline scenario, the study adopts four scenarios to analyze the impact \nof introducing electric vehicles, together with other possible policies, such as aggressive \nfuel  economy  policies  for  both  fossil  fuel-based  and  conventional  vehicles  and \naggressive policies toward cleaner power generation in the power sector. Table 1 shows \nthe four scenarios with brief descriptions. \n\nTable 1: Scenario Definition \n\nScenarios \n2040 BAU \n2040 EV10 \n2040 EV30 \n2040 EV10 + FE \n\n2040 EV30 + FE \n\nDefinitions \nBaseline projections on vehicle numbers and fuel consumption \n10% of the projected number of vehicles are EVs \n30% of the projected number of vehicles are EVs \n10% of the projected number of vehicles are EVs + aggressive fuel \neconomy standards \n30% of the projected number of vehicles are EVs + aggressive fuel \neconomy standards \n\nSource: Li and Chang (2019). \n\nDue to the deep penetration of EVs into the vehicle population in the future, the road \ntransport  sector  needs  strong  support  from  the  power  generation  sector.  To  capture  \nthe  feedback  between  the  two  sectors,  the  scenarios  include  two  sets  of  policy \nalternatives so that they can reflect the possible impacts of the policies on the fuel mix in \nthe  power  generation.  The  study  applies  a  set  of  power  sector  alternative  policy \nscenarios  (APSs)  to  the abovementioned  scenarios.  The  APSs  will  presumably make \nthe power generation cleaner or greener. The APS case states the target of an annual \nimprovement of 3.7% in a fuel economy and in turn its achievement between 2015 and \n2030 (GFEI and IEA 2017).  \n\nThe GFEI and IEA report shows, however, that non-OECD countries achieved an annual \nimprovement of 0.8% in the fuel economy during the period from 2005 to 2015, while \nOECD countries experienced an annual improvement of 1.8% during the same period. \nThe fuel improvement in the BAU scenario is hence assumed to be 0.8% until 2030 and \nthe  same  for  the  period  from  2030  to 2040.  The  study  applied  the  non-OECD  rate  of \n0.8% to all the countries except for Brunei Darussalam and Singapore and the OECD \nrate of 1.8% to Brunei Darussalam and Singapore. \n\nIt  is  worth  noting  that  the  data  relating  to  the  number  of  vehicle  fleets  in  the  ASEAN  \nand the level of corresponding fuel consumption are highly fragmented. Therefore, even \nthe  best  effort  to  collect  data  from  various  sources,  such  as  the  literature,  public \ndatabases, government reports, and news reports, has left room for improvement in data \ncollection. Better data could make the best available estimation possible. \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1025 \n \n\nChang and Li \n\nTable 2 presents the number of vehicles in various fleets in the ASEAN countries in 2015, \nwhile Table 3 presents the estimated fuel consumption levels in 2015. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2: Number of Vehicles in Various Fleets in the ASEAN Countries in 2015  \n(Unit: Thousand) \n\nPassenger Cars \nTrucks \nBuses \nMotorcycles \nTotal \n\n \n\nPassenger Cars \nTrucks \nBuses \nMotorcycles \nTotal \n\nBru \n277.02 \n20.29 \n2.37 \n6.83 \n306.51 \n\nMya \n521.08 \n214.26 \n30.43 \n5,276.68 \n6,042.45 \n\nCam \n28.28 \n6.84 \n0.44 \n326.78 \n362.34 \n\nPhil \n4,037.07 \n24.68 \n28.80 \n4,616.06 \n8,706.61 \n\nIndo \n13,480.97 \n6,611.03 \n2,420.92 \n98,881.27 \n121,394.19 \n\nSing \n\n604.72 \n162.18 \n17.74 \n143.90 \n928.54 \n\nLao \n\n5.18 \n55.72 \n63.01 \n1,531.97 \n1,655.88 \n\nThai \n13,290.47 \n982.70 \n142.86 \n20,395.93 \n34,811.97 \n\nMal \n12,180.29 \n1,177.44 \n72.49 \n12,289.03 \n25,719.25 \n\nViet \n971.93 \n870.32 \n157.75 \n45,164.71 \n47,164.71 \n\nSource: Li and Chang (2019). \n\nMal \n14,470,200,50\n0 \n4,118,882,720 \n\nTable 3: Fuel Consumption in the Road Transport Sector in the ASEAN in 2015  \n(Unit: Liter) \n\nPassenger Cars \n\nBru \n424,635,527.7 \n\nCam \n\n20,574,918 \n\nIndo \n8,796,550,000 \n\nLao \n3,417,540 \n\nTrucks \n\nBuses \n\n91,569,160.12 \n\n14,660,379.24 \n\n108,204,595 \n\n35,482,894.34 \n\n3,438,411.53 \n\n521,306,740 \n\n1,270,042,254 \n\nMotorcycles \n\n3,630,345.73 \n\n79,298,376.05 \n\n336,945,481 \n\n5,197,872,767 \n\n12,179,986,43\n9 \n19,018,022,23\n1 \n21,330,889,69\n5 \n53.83 \n\nTotal (Mtoe) \n\n \n\n0.47 \n\n0.10 \n\nPassenger Cars \n\n340,924,500 \n\nMya \n\nPhil \n6,574,974,714 \n\nSing \n\n983,136,000 \n\nTrucks \nBuses \nMotorcycles \nTotal (Mtoe) \n\n412,789,539 \n323,330,408 \n1,151,368,711 \n1.92 \n\n118,355,056.2 \n761,600,000 \n2,276,687,314 \n8.19 \n\n761,330,957 \n440,657,053 \n79,671,837.8 \n1.99 \n\n0.86 \n\n21.36 \n\nThai \n14,367,700,47\n1 \n3,128,201,737 \n2,191,210,856 \n7,261,453,351 \n22.93 \n\nViet \n638,251,086.2 \n\n1,682,920,994 \n1,351,522,097 \n9,505,862,419 \n11.25 \n\nSource: Li and Chang (2019). \n\nTable 4 presents the status of power generation in the ASEAN power sector as of 2015. \nIt  is  worth  noting  that  the  fuel  mix  in  the  power  sector  and  the  conversion  efficiency \nappear to affect the analysis of EV penetration significantly. \n\nFour  main  factors  appear  to  determine  the  number  of  vehicle  fleets  in  the  ASEAN \ncountries by 2040.

ELECTRIC MOBILITY AND ENERGY CONSUMPTION \n\nIN ASEAN COUNTRIES \n\nThe projection shows that there will be significant increases in the level of final energy \nconsumption  in  the  ASEAN  countries  by  all  types  of  fleets,  such  as  passenger  cars, \ntrucks, buses, and motorcycles. As electric vehicles penetrate into the fleets, the degree \nof reduction in the level of final energy consumption will be drastic. Figure 1 presents the \nlevel of final energy consumption by fleets and scenarios in 2040 in the ASEAN countries.  \n\nFigure 1: The Level of Final Energy Consumption by Fleets and Scenarios  \nin the ASEAN Countries in 2040  \n(Unit: Mtoe) \n\nSource: Li and Chang (2019). \n\n \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1025 \n \n\nChang and Li \n\nCombining the effects of the introduction of EVs and higher fuel efficiency, the ASEAN \nanticipates a possible future with a lower level of final energy consumption in the road \ntransport sector, which the APS with 30% of EV penetration shows. The introduction of \nEVs  into  the  road  transport  sector  typically  proceeds by combining  the  road  transport \nand  the  power  sector.  When  considering  the  level  of  primary  fossil  fuel  energy \nconsumption  in  the  power  sector,  the  penetration  of  EVs  actually  may  not  contribute \nmuch  to  reducing  the  level  of  primary  energy  consumption  if  thermal  power  still \ndominates the power generation in the ASEAN countries by 2040. A higher penetration \nrate of EVs and a higher level of primary energy consumption in the road transport sector \nwould be the case.  \n\nSuch  a  finding  is  not  surprising  for  two  reasons.  First,  although  an  EV  power  train \nintrinsically has a high level of performance in fuel economy, the low efficiency of thermal \npower generation will mostly erode such an advantage if thermal power dominates the \npower sector. Second, the fuel economy of conventional vehicles in the BAU scenario is \nlikely to improve by about 30%. In the APS scenarios, the fuel economy can improve by \nas much as 70% or more. Further application of conventional vehicles with improved fuel \neconomy will actually contribute to a lower level of primary energy consumption than EVs \n(Li and Chang 2019). \n\nThe  last  two  scenarios  provide  other  interesting  observations.  The  aggressive \nimplementation  of  fuel  economy  in  the  ASEAN  countries  appears  to  promote  EV \npenetration (Li and Chang 2019). The level of primary energy consumption in the road \ntransport sector seems to be improving significantly, and the aggressive fuel economy \nappears to be the main driver. Figure 2 presents the level of consumption of fossil energy \nby  scenarios  in  2040  in  the  ASEAN.  It  shows  that  the  AP  case  integrates  renewable \nenergy aggressively into the power sector. In the case of 30% penetration of EVs, the \nlevel of primary energy consumption will be higher than with only 10% of EV penetration \nfor two reasons. First, in terms of energy efficiency, aggressive fuel economy results in \na higher level of energy efficiency than EVs, so more EVs mean a higher level of primary \nenergy consumption if all other things are equal. Second, EVs obtain their energy from \na power grid, and fossil fuel-fired generation, such as coal and natural gas, still dominates \nthe power grid. In such a case, higher losses in the conversion process of fossil fuels \ninto electricity further erode the level of well-to-wheel energy efficiency of EVs.  \n\nHaving  noticed  such  a  contradictory  case,  in  which  the  level  of  primary  energy \nconsumption  is  increasing  rather  than  decreasing,  it  would  be  interesting  to  examine \nwhat will happen if aggressive policies increase the integration of renewables into the \npower  sector.  The  ASEAN  will  implement  the  policies  by  2040,  when  the  power \ngeneration  sector  in  the  ASEAN  follows  the  assumptions  that  the  APS  scenario  of  \nthe  power  sector  outlook  presents  according  to  the  Economic  Research  Institute  for \nASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) (2016). With the adoption of aggressive policies to improve \nthe integration of renewables into the power sector of the ASEAN, the penetration of EVs \nwill help to reduce the level of primary energy consumption in the ASEAN\u2019s road transport \nsector. First, without the achievement of the aggressive fuel economy in the ASEAN, the \n30%  penetration  of  EV  appears  to  be  the  best  policy  target.  Second,  with  the \nachievement of the aggressive fuel economy in the ASEAN, only the penetration level of \n10% \npenetration  \nof EVs. \n\nappears \n\nideal \n\nlevel \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\nbe \n\nto \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Fossil Energy Consumption by Scenarios in 2040 in ASEAN  \n(Unit: Mtoe) \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1025 \n \n\nChang and Li \n\nSource: Li and Chang (2019). \n\n \n\nThe  introduction  of  EVs  into  the  ASEAN  countries  appears  to  make  the  ASEAN\u2019s  \nfinal  energy  consumption  in  the  road  transport  sector  decrease  significantly  in  the \nalternative scenarios of 2040 compared with the BAU scenario of 2040. However, taking \ninto consideration the level of primary energy consumption in the power sector to charge \nEVs,  the  level  of  primary  energy  consumption  in  the  ASEAN\u2019s  road  transport  sector \nactually  appears  to  be  higher  than  that  in  the  BAU  scenario  of  2040.  This  is  mainly \ncaused by the expectation that fossil fuels will generate a majority of the electricity in the \nASEAN and that there will be huge losses during the conversion process from fossil fuels \ninto  electricity  (Li  and  Chang  2019).  When  considering  the  large-scale  introduction  of \nEVs  into  the  ASEAN  countries\u2019  road  transport  sector,  the  large-scale  introduction  of \nrenewables should either precede EVs or at least occur simultaneously with EVs. It is \nworth  noting  that,  due  to  the  lack  of  availability  of  data,  this  study  makes  many \nassumptions.  Such  assumptions  need  further  testing  or  the  building  of  sub-models  to \nincorporate those assumptions to obtain more accurate estimations in future studies. \n\n5.  ELECTRO MOBILITY AND THE URBAN AIR QUALITY \n\nWhen  implementing  the  electrification  of the  road  transport  sector  in  the  ASEAN,  the \nlevel  of  primary  energy  consumption  appears  to  decrease  under  aggressive  APS \nscenarios. Taking SO2 emissions as an indicator of the urban air quality, this study shows \nhow the electrification of the road transport sector could affect the urban air quality in the \nASEAN in 2040. \n\nFigure 3 presents the level of SO2 emissions in 2040 by scenarios. As expected, the no-\nEV case shows that the urban air quality in 2040 could be far worse than in 2015 as the \nexpectation is that the level of SO2 emissions will actually increase. The cases of 10% \nEVs and 30% EVs appear not to improve the urban air quality either, as the higher level \nof electrification in the road transport sector is likely to drive the level of primary energy \nconsumption  to  increase.  Electricity  generated  from  fossil  fuel  sources  can  meet  the \nhigher demand for electricity due to the higher penetration of electric mobility, eventually \nincreasing the primary energy consumption.  \n\nWith the implementation of an aggressive fuel mix policy for power generation with 10% \npenetration of electric mobility, as the scenario of \u201cFE plus 10% EV\u201d shows, the urban \nair quality in 2040 can be better than that in 2015. With an aggressive fuel mix policy and \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1025 \n \n\nChang and Li \n\n30%  penetration  of electric  mobility,  as  the  scenario of  \u201cFE  plus 30%  EV\u201d  shows,  the \nurban air quality can be far better than in 2015.  \n\nFigure 3: Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Emissions by Scenarios  \n(Unit: Tons) \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation. \n\n \n\nThe  penetration  of  electric  vehicles  contributes  to  lower  SO2  emissions,  and  higher  \nfuel efficiency standards seem to contribute even more. In addition, if countries introduce \nmore  renewable  energy  into  the  power  generation  sector,  SO2  emissions  will  fall  far \nmore.  \n\nApart from the economic and energy-related benefits, people expect electric mobility to \nbring environmental benefits, such as improvements in the urban air quality. The current \nstudy,  however,  shows  that  achieving  such  environmental  improvements  with  electric \nmobility  alone  appears  to  be  very  difficult.  It  suggests  that  a  more  aggressive  policy \ntoward the fuel mix in power generation is necessary, together with an electric mobility \npolicy. \n\n6.  CONCLUSION \n\nThis study links energy insecurity to public health through the analysis of the changes in \nurban  air  quality  due  to  the  penetration of  electric  mobility  in  the  ASEAN  countries  in \n2040.  It  finds  that  electric  mobility  can  decrease  the  primary  energy  consumption  in \nrelation to sulfur dioxide emissions from vehicles and power generation. \n\nIt calculates the amount of sulfur dioxides by scenarios and finds that two scenarios with \nan aggressive fuel mix policy for power generation will decrease sulfur dioxide emissions \ncompared with the no EV scenario and even 2015. This indicates that electric mobility \n(but only with an aggressive fuel mix policy for power generation) can alleviate the status \nof energy insecurity by improving the urban air quality. \n\nThe high penetration of electric mobility in the ASEAN countries can decrease the level \nof final energy consumption compared with the case of no electric mobility. For the level \nof primary energy consumption, however, electric mobility alone will not bring much of a \ndecrease.  Implementing  electric  mobility  with  an  aggressive  fuel  mix  policy  for  power \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1025 \n \n\nChang and Li \n\ngeneration appears to decrease the level of primary energy consumption compared with \nthe no electric mobility scenario, and it could be lower than the base case scenario.  \n\nThe study understands energy insecurity in the framework verifying the consequences \nof  less access  to  energy  for  public  health.  Electric  mobility  can  improve  the  urban  air \nquality by decreasing the amount of harmful air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxides. High \npenetration of electric mobility with an aggressive fuel mix policy for power generation, \nas shown in the scenario of \u201cFE+30% EV\u201d in 2040, can decrease the amount of sulfur \ndioxides emitted  in cities so  that  the urban  air  quality  improves,  in  turn alleviating  the \nproblem of energy insecurity.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1025 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nChang and Li \n\nAfif, C., C.

The level of primary energy consumption, \nhowever, may not decrease unless countries adopt aggressive policies toward the integration \nof renewable energy into electricity generation. This study presents the consequences of the \nelectrification of road transport in the ASEAN in terms of various energy dimensions, namely \nprimary and final energy consumption, the integration of renewable energy, the importing of \nfossil  fuels,  and  the  levels  of  carbon  dioxide  and  sulfur  dioxide  emissions.  Taking  the \nemissions of  sulfur  dioxides  as an  indicator  of  the  urban  air  quality,  this  study  investigates \nwhether and how the electrification of road transport helps to enhance the status of energy \ninsecurity by improving the urban air quality. The findings of this study suggest the need to \nimplement an aggressive fuel mix policy for electricity generation with a strong drive for electric \nmobility. \n \nKeywords: electric mobility, urban air quality, sulfur dioxide, ASEAN, fuel mix policy for \nelectricity generation \n \nJEL Classification: N75, Q40, Q42, Q48 \n \n", " \n"]}
