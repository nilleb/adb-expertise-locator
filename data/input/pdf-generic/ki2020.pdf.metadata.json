In the photo are Mai, an ethnic mother and her child living in Cao Bang, \na poor province in the North Viet Nam. The single mother has two children, one of whom is disabled. She and the other \nchild were happy when receiving an SMS informing that money had been transferred successfully to her bank account. \nThey no longer have to travel far and wait in a long line every month. E-payment is more convenient, faster, and safer.\nCover design by Nguyen Thanh Hien.

and the Pacific 2020 is the 51st edition in an annual series that has \nbecome a vital reference for policymakers, development practitioners, government officials, \nresearchers, and students around the world.\nCovering the 49 Asian Development Bank (ADB) member economies located in Asia \nand the Pacific, the publication provides statistics on a comprehensive set of economic, \nfinancial, social, and environmental measures as well as select indicators for the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs). This information is also accessible in digitized format via the Key \nIndicators Database (kidb.adb.org). \nPrepared by ADB\u2019s Statistics and Data Innovation Unit, Key Indicators for Asia and the \nPacific 2020 highlights the tremendous development progress made throughout the Asia \nand Pacific region from 2000 to 2019. In that time, our region has become the world\u2019s largest \ncontributor to global gross domestic product (in current United States dollars), reaching a \n34.9% share in 2019. Value chain statistics also show that changes over time in comparative \nadvantages across economies in Asia and the Pacific reflect their ability to expand their \ncompetitiveness in key sectors and strengthen, broaden, and diversify their participation \nin global production networks. Meanwhile, the region\u2019s maternal mortality ratio was more \nthan halved from 2000 to 2017. Perhaps most heartening of all, from 2002 to 2015, almost 850 \nmillion people across Asia and the Pacific were raised out of extreme poverty (based on the \n$\u00a01.90 a day poverty line).\nWhile the region has done remarkably well, the issues that challenge inclusive and \nsustainable development remain, and these will likely be amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic \nand the strategies adopted to mitigate the spread of the virus. The data for SDG indicators \nto 2019 show that poverty and its associated issues need to be addressed as a priority. The \nindicators highlight areas in which urgent attention is necessary, in particular, the need to \nexpand provision of safe water and sanitation facilities; improve access to, and the quality of, \neducation and health services; and ensure that all people have safe, nutritious, and sufficient \nfood to eat all year round. \nTo live up to the \u201cleave no one behind\u201d principle that is inherent in the SDGs, the \navailability of accurate, granular, and more informative data is crucial. Factors such as location, \nage, gender, ethnicity, income status, and disability status are needed to identify and address \ninequitable socioeconomic progress. The special supplement to this year\u2019s Key Indicators \nfor Asia and the Pacific explores how innovative data sources (such as satellite imagery) and \nartificial intelligence can complement conventional methods to enhance the granularity of \npoverty statistics, providing more detailed guidance for policymakers throughout the region.", "xiv Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2020\nADB is indebted to our statistical partners in member economies, who provide us with the \nmost recent data from their official sources. We are also thankful for the contributions of the \ninternational agencies that are responsible for the data in many of the publication\u2019s tables. We \nappreciate that many of our friends and colleagues have been working under especially trying \ncircumstances during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we applaud them for their professionalism \nthroughout. At a time when sound evidence for policy design, formulation, and monitoring \nmay be more essential than ever, we hope that Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2020 will \nbe a valuable resource for data on major development issues. As always, we welcome feedback \nfrom our users on both the content and structure of the publication. \nMasatsugu Asakawa\nPresident \nAsian Development Bank", "xv\nAcknowledgments\nThis 51st edition of Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific was prepared by the Statistics and \nData Innovation Unit (EROD-SDI) within the Economic Research and Regional Cooperation \nDepartment (ERCD) at the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The publication team was led by \nStefan Schipper, under the overall direction of Elaine S. Tan. Pamela Lapitan, Melissa Pascua, \nand Eric Suan provided technical and coordination support in preparing the data and tables. \nThe statistical tables presenting development indicators for ADB\u2019s regional member \neconomies in Parts I and II of the printed publication (and also available online via kidb.adb.org), \nas well as the 49 tables for individual economies available exclusively online, were prepared by \nEROD-SDI staff and consultants, under the supervision of Kaushal Joshi, Mahinthan Joseph \nMariasingham, Arturo Martinez Jr., Lakshman Nagraj Rao, and Stefan Schipper.

Some values may not add up to 100% due to limitations on data availability.\nb  For 2016, data refer to April\u2013September only.\nc  Recommendations from the 19th International Conference of Labour Statisticians were adopted by Armenia, for 2018 onward; Mongolia, for 2019; Nepal, for 2018; the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic, for 2017; and Timor-Leste, for 2010 and 2016. Hence, data for these years may not be directly comparable with data in other years. The conference provides the statistical concept of work \nfor reference purposes; and the operational concepts, definitions, and guidelines for (i) three distinct subsets of work activities, referred to as forms of work (including own-use production work), \nemployment work, and volunteer work; (ii) related classifications of the population according to their labor force status and main work status; and (iii) measures of labor underutilization. The concept \nof employment has also been refined to refer to work for pay or profit.\nd  Prior to 2017, employment in services includes people who were engaged in construction industries.\ne  For 2000, employment in services includes people who were engaged in electricity, gas, and water industries.\nf  Refers to persons engaged in social labor and receiving remuneration or earning business income.\ng  Employment in services includes people who are engaged in electricity and gas supply; water supply; and sewerage, waste management, and remediation activities.\nh  For 2000, employment in services includes people who are engaged in electricity, gas, water, and construction industries.\ni  For 2005 and 2017, data are from censuses of population. For all other years, data are from labor force surveys. Thus, data prior to and after the census years may not be directly comparable with 2005 \nand 2017 data.\nj  Figures include local population only. For 2010, employment in services includes people who were engaged in industries other than agriculture, forestry, and fishing; mining and quarrying; or manufacturing.\nk  Some data may not add up because (i) for 2005 and 2011\u20132013, data cover all islands; (ii) for 2003, data exclude the Northern Province; (iii) for 2004, data exclude Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi districts; \nand (iv) for years prior to 2003 and 2006\u20132010, data exclude northern and eastern provinces.\nl  For 2005, employment in services includes people who were engaged in water supply; and sewerage, waste management, and remediation activities.\nm For 2005, annual data on labor force refer to the average of April, July, and October figures, in view of the adoption of a new definition.\nn  Refers to Singapore residents only.\no  Refers to total number of persons engaged in any activity regardless of age.\np  Covers all wage and salary earners from all islands. For 2001, employment in services includes people who were engaged in electricity, gas, water, and construction industries.\nq  Refers to the number of employed persons excluding those who are engaged in unpaid employment as of end of June.\nr  Refers to cash work and unpaid village work. For 2005, employment figures by industry include only paid (cash work) workers, and as such, the number of employed for all industries may not add up to \nthe total number of employed, which includes both cash workers and unpaid village workers. For 2010, employment in agriculture includes people who were engaged in mining and quarrying.\ns  For 2000 and 2005, employment in services includes people who were engaged in electricity, gas, water, and construction industries.\nt  Figures for 2001, 2006, and 2011 may not be directly comparable to 2017 figures due to differences in the primary data sources.\nu  For 2009, the figure refers to paid

From 2000 to 2019, Taipei,China maintained its place as the most competitive \neconomy for electricals, having an unchanged RCA of 3.1. Meanwhile, Viet Nam registered a notable \nincrease in its NRCA, from 0.1 to 0.6, while that of the People\u2019s Republic of China climbed from 1.1 to 2.3. \n\u2022  Results affirm the potential of \u201cservicification\u201d, especially in business services. Among the outstanding \nperformers here was the Philippines, whose increase in RCA from 0.6 in 2000 to 1.0 in 2019 catapulted \nit to fifth place among the Asian economies. This is driven by its business process outsourcing sector. \n\u2022  While increasing the space for international competition, GVCs also expose economies to greater \nuncertainties. On average, an increase in GVC participation of 10 percentage points is associated with \na 0.06-increase in the standard deviation of the RCA index. This points to the need for a strong policy \nframework that maximizes benefits while minimizing risks.\nThe years since the 1990s have been a time of global  (RCA) index of Balassa (1965), a measure used to \nvalue chain (GVC) revolution\u2014the rise of internationally  examine  the  competitiveness  of  Asian  economies \nlinked production processes that are fragmented across  and identify the sectors they specialize in.

This information can then \nare less efficient at producing. However, because it  guide policy.\nBox 1: Calculating Measures of Revealed Comparative Advantage\nThe traditional measure of revealed comparative advantage (TRCA) follows Balassa (1965). The measure is obtained by dividing the share of \nan economy\u2013sector\u2019s gross exports with the sector\u2019s gross exports from all economies as a share of world total gross exports. More formally, \nTRCA can be expressed as \nwhere   is economy r\u2019s exports of products from sector i, N is the number of products (or industries in the input\u2013output setting), and G is the \nnumber of economies in the world economy. Economy r is said to have a comparative advantage (with respect to the world) in the production \nof product i if  . Otherwise, it is said to have a comparative disadvantage in product i. \nBalassa\u2019s index more accurately reflects cross-economy differences in comparative advantage in a world that exclusively trades finished \nproducts. As argued in literature, TRCA may not be the most appropriate measure of comparative advantage in a global value chain world \ncharacterized by intensive and extensive networks of trade in intermediates. There are at least two reasons for this. First, TRCA ignores the \nfact that an economy\u2013sector\u2019s value-added may be exported indirectly via the economy\u2019s exports in other sectors. Hence, a more conceptually \ncorrect measure should be able to account for value-added exported indirectly across economy\u2013sectors. Second, TRCA neglects the fact that \nan economy\u2013sector\u2019s gross exports may at least partly carry foreign value-added. Therefore, a conceptually correct measure should exclude \nforeign value-added embedded in exports. \nThe abovementioned empirical complications may be evaded by using forward-linkage based domestic value-added in exports (DVA_F) in \nlieu of gross exports, as proposed by Wang, Wei, and Zhu (2018). An economy-sector\u2019s DVA_F refers to the domestic value-added that is \noriginated from that economy-sector and ultimately embodied in exports regardless of where these exports are finally consumed. Intuitively, \nDVA_F may be interpreted as a measure of an economy-sector\u2019s significance as a supplier of value-added in exports. Rewriting Balassa\u2019s \nindex by replacing gross exports with DVA_F yields a new revealed comparative advantage measure that more accurately depicts patterns of \nspecialization. Here, new revealed comparative advantage of economy r in product i is obtained using the following formula: \nAs in TRCA, economy r is said to have a comparative advantage (with respect to the world) in the production of good i if  . \nOtherwise, it is said to have a comparative disadvantage in product i.  \nReferences\nB.

GNI is the sum of value added by all resident \nproducers, plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output, \nplus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees and property income) \nfrom abroad. GNI, calculated in national currency, is usually converted to US dollars \nat official exchange rates for comparisons across economies, although an alternative \nrate is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally \nlarge margin from the rate actually applied in international transactions. To smooth \nfluctuations in prices and exchange rates, a special Atlas method of conversion is used \nby the World Bank. This applies a conversion factor that averages the exchange rate \nfor a given year and the 2 preceding years, adjusted for differences in rates of inflation \nbetween the country, and through 2000, the G-5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, \nthe United Kingdom, and the US).
