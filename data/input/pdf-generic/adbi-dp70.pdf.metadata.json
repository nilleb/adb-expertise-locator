INTRODUCTION \n\nIndonesia, the country worst hit by the December 2004 tsunami that struck numerous \ncountries across Asia, is located in the \u201cRing of Fire\u201d consisting of volcanic arcs and \noceanic trenches partly encircling the Pacific Basin. The Basin sits between the Indo-\nAustralian and Eurasian plates, making it a zone of frequent volcanic eruptions and \nearthquakes.  Historically,  several  of  the  natural  disasters  that  have  occurred  in \nIndonesia  have  been  among  the  worst  in  the  world.  The  Tambora  and  Krakatoa \neruptions in 1815 and 1883 were among the largest eruptions in history. Further, the \ncontour and climate of the archipelago increase the likelihood of other deadly natural \ndisasters such as cyclones, droughts, and floods. From 1907 to mid-2006 there were \n338 natural disasters in Indonesia\u2014an average of around three to four disasters per \nyear. 1  On  average,  approximately  700  people  died,  1,200  were  injured,  5,200 \nbecame  homeless,  and  64,000  people  were  affected  per  event. 2  Indonesia  is \nconsidered  to  be  among  the  five  countries  that  most  frequently  experience  deadly \nnatural  disasters\u2014the  others  being  the  US,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  India, \nand the Philippines. Recent data suggests that the frequency of these deadly events \nmay be increasing in these countries (Figure 1).  \n\nIn terms of human fatalities the tsunami on 26 December 2004 was the worst natural \ndisaster  in  Indonesian  history.  Most  people  in  Aceh  and  North  Sumatra  and  other \nnearby parts of Indonesia felt the tremor caused by a massive earthquake measuring \n9.0  on  the  Richter  scale  that  occurred  beneath  the  seabed  about  30  kilometres  off \nthe  west of Sumatra at  about 8 am local time. Shortly after, a great tsunami hit the \nnorthern  and  western  parts  of  Aceh  and  North  Sumatra  as  well  as  other  smaller \nislands  such  as  Nias  and  Simeulue.  Ten-metre  waves  struck  Banda  Aceh,  the \nprovincial capital city of the province of Aceh, at a tremendous speed of around 800 \nkilometres  per  hour.  In  some  places  waves  swept  over  seven  kilometres  inland. \nWaves as high as twelve metres hit the  towns of Meulaboh, Calang, and Lamno in \nwestern Aceh and in some places up to about ten kilometres from the coastline were \nsubmerged (Soehaimi et al., 2005). The official death toll (including missing) in Aceh \nand Nias was close to 167,000. More than 500,000 persons were displaced. Official \nreports also listed widespread destruction, including the loss of over 110,000 houses, \n3,000 kilometres of roads, 14 seaports, 11 airports and air strips, 120 arterial bridges, \n2,000  school  buildings,  and  8  hospitals,  among  much  other  damage  (BRR  and \nInternational Partners, 2005; BRR, 2006) \n\nOn  28  March  2005,  while  Aceh  was  still  coping  with  the  first  emergency,  another \nmajor  earthquake  devastated  the  western  part  of  Sumatra.  The  epicentre  of  this \nearthquake,  8.7  on  the  Richter  scale,  was  located  to  the  north  of  Nias\u2014halfway \nbetween  Simeulue  and  the  Nias  islands  (Map  1).  Although  the  government  never \ndeclared  this  to  be  a  national  disaster, for  an  island  as small  and  poor  as  Nias  the \nimpact  was  overwhelming.  Over  800  people  died  and  6,300  were  injured.  In  the \ncapital city of Gunungsitoli around 70 per cent of the buildings collapsed. There was \nwidespread  fear  and  it  was  estimated  that  over  15,000  people  fled  the  island.  The \nearthquake  disrupted  the  livelihood  of  the  entire  population  of  Nias,  most  of  whom \n\n                                                 \n1 This is based on records maintained by the World Health Organization\u2019s Center for \nResearch on the Epidemiology of Disasters at the Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, \nBrussels. To be included in this WHO database of natural disasters, a disaster should fulfill at \nleast one of the following criteria: (1) ten or more people reported killed, (2) 100 people \nreported affected, (3) a call for international assistance, or (4) a declaration of a state of \nemergency. \n2 See http://www.em-dat.net \n\n1 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\nare  farmers  and  fishermen  (Kompas,  29  March  2005;  Aceh  Media  Center,  5  May \n2005; BPS Kabupaten Nias, 2005).  \n\nThis survey aims to evaluate the rehabilitation process in Aceh and Nias following the \ntsunami and earthquake. Our evaluation sets out to assess progress and to identify \nthe  challenges  of  redevelopment.  With  this  goal  in  mind,  we  undertook  three  main \nactivities.  First,  we  conducted  a  survey  of  the  data  sources  on  the  impact  of  the \ndisasters  in  Aceh  and  Nias  and  on  the  progress  of  reconstruction.  Second,  we \nanalysed  data  from  the  census  (Sensus  Penduduk  Aceh  dan  Nias  or  SPAN  2005) \ncarried  out  by  the  Indonesian  Central  Statistics  Agency  (Badan  Pusat  Statistik  or \nBPS) in Aceh and Nias in September 2005 to obtain a detailed picture of the impact \nat household level (see BPS, 2005a; 2005b, hereafter cited as SPAN 2005).3 Third, \nwe  arranged \nlocal \ngovernment  officials,  officials  at  the  Badan  Rekonstruksi  dan  Rehabilitasi  (BRR) \nreconstruction  agency,  contractors,  and  many  others  (Appendix  I).  Most  of  the \ninterviews took place in January, May, and June 2006. A triangulation procedure was \napplied to draw inferences from these in-depth interviews (Patton, 2002).4  \n\ninterviews  with  national  government  officials \n\nin  Jakarta, \n\nThis  monograph  is  structured  as  follows.  Following  this  introduction,  background \nmaterial  is  provided  on  the  socio-economic  and  political  situation  in  Aceh  and  Nias \nbefore the disasters. In particular, information is provided about political conflicts and \nthe  Aceh  freedom  movement.  The  next  section  summarises  the  impact  of  the \nDecember  2004  tsunami  in  Aceh  and  the  March  2005  earthquake  in  Nias.  This \nsection is followed by a discussion of the emergency relief stage. Three main issues \nneed to be elaborated upon concerning the foundations of the recovery:  \n\nthe Master Plan,  \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nthe establishment of the reconstruction and rehabilitation agency (BRR), and  \n\nthe  peace  agreement  between  the  Government  of  Indonesia  (GoI)  and  the \nFree Aceh Movement (GAM).  \n\nThen  we  describe  recent  progress  in  various  areas\u2014land  titling,  housing,  livelihood \narrangements,  school  and  health  services,  and  infrastructure\u2014and  note  that \nprogress  towards  meeting  goals  is  slow  and  that  huge  challenges  remain.  In  this \nsection  we  also  discuss issues relating  to  managing  expectations,  coordination  and \n\n                                                 \n3  The  census  was  conducted  by  BPS,  Bappenas,  and  UNFPA  (with  the  help  of  the \ninternational donor agencies CIDA, AusAID, and NZAID) in response to the need for accurate \ndemographic data after the disasters in Aceh and Nias. BPS, the main agency conducting the \nfield survey, must be congratulated on this achievement for several reasons. First, the census \nwas prepared very quickly. By comparison, for example, preparations for the 2010 Indonesian \nNational  Census  are  already  being  made  now  in  2006.  Second,  the  challenges  involved  in \nconducting a population census in the post-disaster area of Aceh and in the remote areas of \nNias were enormous. These included security challenges in several conflict regions of Aceh. \nThird,  BPS  has  been  able  to  include  all  people  in  Aceh  and  Nias  in  the  census.  The  actual \nwork, in the form of instrument finalisation, started in June 2005, and the census date as the \nreference  for  the  data  was  set  as  15  September  2005.  The  data  set  has  been  publicly \navailable  since  early  2006.  In  addition  to  collecting  demographic  data  at  the  time  of  the \nreference date, the census also collected data on internally displaced persons (IDPs) defined \nas persons that, due to a natural disaster, have had to leave their usual dwelling. These IDPs \ncould be located in tents, ruined houses, or other family houses.  \n4 In a triangular procedure, any information obtained from an interview is used only when \nreconfirmed by at least two other respondents.  \n\n2 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\ncommitments, budget realisation, and the exit strategy of the BRR. Finally, we set out \nsome conclusions.  \n\n2. ACEH AND NIAS BEFORE THE DISASTERS  \n\nThere are significant differences between the socio-economic and political structures \nin  Aceh  and  on  the  island  of  Nias.  Aceh  is  a  much  larger  and  more  heterogenous \nregion  than  Nias.  Aceh  is  itself  a  province  while  Nias  is  only  a  small  region  of  the \nprovince of North Sumatra (Map 1). Although the majority of the population in Aceh \nwork  in  the  agricultural  sector,  the  economy  of  Aceh  has  been  dominated  for \ndecades by the oil and gas industry. In contrast, Nias has a less sophisticated and a \npredominantly  semi-subsistence  economy.  Aceh  has  experienced  three  decades  of \nserious political conflict while there has not been any serious political turmoil in Nias.  \n\n2.1. Economic Conditions in Aceh \n\nAceh\u2019s GDP in 2003 was approximately US$4.5 billion, about 2 per cent of the GDP \nof Indonesia. While the Acehnese economy has generally benefited from the regional \noil  and  gas  industry,  in  2004  the  local  energy  sector  contracted  somewhat, \ncontributing  to  negative  growth  in  the  province  (Table  1).  The  agriculture  sector, \nwhich  makes  up  around  32  per  cent  of  regional  GDP,  also  plays  a  key  role  in  the \nlocal economy. Agriculture absorbs almost 50 per cent of labour in Aceh. Other major \nsectors  of  employment  are  trade  (21  per  cent)  and  public  services  (18  per  cent) \n(Bappeda Aceh, 2005).  \n\nIn  the  early  2000s  Aceh\u2019s  exports  to  other  parts  of  Indonesia  were  small,  around  8 \nper cent of regional output. About 26 per cent of Aceh\u2019s output was exported abroad \nand  66  per  cent  was  consumed  within  the  province.  Imports  from  other  parts  of \nIndonesia  and  from  abroad  were  a  small  part,  about  6  per  cent  and  4  per  cent \nrespectively,  of  the  total  material  inputs  needed  for  Aceh\u2019s  productive  sectors \n(Athukorala and Resosudarmo, 2005).  \n\nRegional  inflation  (as  measured  in  the  provincial  capital  of  Banda  Aceh)  was \nmoderate in the period just before the tsunami (Figure 2).  \n\nAceh\u2019s  population  was  around  4.1  million  in  2003.  Although,  on  paper,  Acehnese \nGDP per capita (almost US$1,100) was among the highest in Indonesia because of \nthe statistical boost to measured production provided by the oil and gas sector, in fact \nmany local areas in Aceh did not receive noticeable benefits from the enclave energy \nsector  and  were  quite  underdeveloped.  Indeed,  before  the  tsunami  the  Ministry  for \nthe Development of Least Developed Regions had classified eleven districts in Aceh \n(around half of the total in the province) as \u201cleast developed districts\u201d. In 2003 it was \nestimated that the percentage of poor people in Aceh was almost 30 per cent (almost \n20 per cent and 34 per cent in urban and in rural areas, respectively), while the figure \nfor  Indonesia  as  a  whole  was  around  17  per  cent  (14  per  cent  and  20  per  cent  in \nurban  and  rural  areas,  respectively).  Aceh  was  among  the  five  provinces  with  the \nhighest percentage of poor people (BPS, 2005). The long-term socio-political conflict \nwas widely believed to be one of the major causes for the lack of development in the \nprovince (Soesastro and Ace, 2005). \n\nThe  Indonesian  national  decentralisation  program  which  became  effective  in  2001 \nbrought  dramatic  changes  to  the  public  revenue  and  expenditure  patterns  in  Aceh. \nRegional government spending in 2004 was double that in 1999. However, the bulk \nof the expenditure was still for routine administrative expenses (such as salaries and \nbuilding maintenance) (World Bank, 2003 and 2006b; Bappeda Aceh, 2005).  \n\n3 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\n2.2. Economic Conditions in Nias \n\nWith  a  population  of  about  700,000  people,  Nias  is  considered  to  be  one  of  the \npoorest  regions  in  the  province  of  North  Sumatra.  The  island\u2019s  economy  is  still \nprimarily subsistence-based. There is not much trade between Nias and other parts \nof North Sumatra and its contribution to the provincial economy of North Sumatra is \nvery  small.  Per capita  income  was  estimated  at  about  US$340  per  annum  in  2004. \nThe  share  of  the  population  living  below  the  poverty  line  in  2002  was  31  per  cent, \nroughly twice North Sumatra\u2019s level of 16 per cent or the Indonesia-wide figure of 18 \nper  cent.  Further,  compared  to  the  regions  in  the  North  Sumatra  province  and \nnationally,  human  development  results  were  low  and  signs  of  progress  were  also \nvery  slow.  Close  to  half  of  the  household  heads  in  Nias  only  have  elementary \nschooling.  About  one-third  of  children  between  7\u201318  years  of  age  did  not  attend \nschool in 2002. Despite the availability of health centres throughout the island, lack of \naccess  to  satisfactory  basic  health  services  was  still  widespread  because  of \ninadequate services and poor infrastructure (BPS Kabupaten Nias, 2005). \n\nLack  of  infrastructure  is  commonly  cited  as  one  of  the  main  reasons  for  the \nbackwardness of the region. Poor infrastructure limits mobility across the island and \nisolates  villages  from  markets,  leading  to  low  levels  of  economic  development.  In \n2004  the  local  Nias  economy  was  still  mainly  reliant  on  agriculture  and  trade \nservices, accounting for almost 37 and 35 per cent, respectively, of the total regional \nGDP. Trade services in  Nias,  however,  are  largely  limited  to  activities  conducted  in \nthe informal sector. As in other backward regions, the role of local government in the \nformal  sector  of  the  economy  was  quite  high.  In  2004,  total  local  government \nexpenditure was around Rp 200 billion (a little over US$20 million), approximately 10 \nper cent of the Nias GDP (BPS Kabupaten Nias, 2005).  \n\n2.3. Conflict and Freedom Movements in Aceh \n\nSocio-political conflict between the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) and the Indonesian \ngovernment began in the mid-1970s. This conflict escalated in the five years prior to \nthe  2004  tsunami,  destroying  or  damaging  about  900  schools,  causing  a  dramatic \ndecline in school attendance, and displacing over 100,000 people. Meanwhile, health \ncare became less accessible because people were afraid to visit medical centres for \nsecurity  reasons  (Soesastro  and Ace,  2005; World  Bank,  2005).  Another  significant \nimpact was the drop in the number of economic establishments and in the quality of \ninfrastructure in the region. The total number of firms declined from around 7,600 in \n2001  to  only  around  1,200  by  2004.  Many  roads  were  not  properly maintained  and \npeople  were  often  afraid  to  travel  outside  of  their  towns  and  villages,  particularly  at \nnight (Bappeda Aceh, 2005). \n\nThe  basic  causes  of  the  separatist  movement  can  be  found  in  the  history  of  the \nrelationship between the people of Aceh and the central authorities in Jakarta. During \nthe  Dutch  colonial  period  the  region  was  never  formally  annexed.  Consequently, \nduring  the  early  years  of  Indonesian  independence  in  the  late  1940s  there  was  a \nstrong feeling in  some quarters of Aceh that the region should not be automatically \nincorporated into the new state of Indonesia and that, certainly, the Acehnese people \nshould have  been consulted  as  to  whether  they  wanted  to  join  with  Indonesia or  to \nform an independent state. Twenty years later, the centralised mode of government \nduring Soeharto's \u201cNew Order\u201d government strengthened this sentiment among some \nAcehnese,  particularly  when  the  central  government  signed  contracts  with  foreign \ncompanies for the mining of natural resources in Aceh without consultation with the \npeople of Aceh. Much local resentment was generated when the Acehnese realised \n\n4 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\nthat  most  of  the  income  from  the  oil  and  gas  activities  in  the  region  flowed  to  the \ncentral government rather than into local coffers.  \n\nThe  armed struggle  waged  by  the  GAM  guerrilla movement  escalated in  the  1980s \nwhen  they  allegedly  received  support  from  overseas  groups.  The  Government  of \nIndonesia  responded  with  repressive  measures  and  placed  the  region  under \nOperational  Military  status.  This  led  to  an  increase  in  local  conflict,  causing  deaths \nand  a  rise  in  the  number  of  internally  displaced  persons.  During  the  military \noperations,  both  GAM  and  the  Indonesian  government  accused  each  other  of \nviolating human rights. The military operation officially ended in 1996. However, the \nmilitary presence in the region was not reduced, even after Soeharto stepped down \nfrom office in 1998. In fact the military presence is thought to have increased in the \nearly 2000s during the Megawati Sukarnoputri administration (World Bank, 2006b).  \n\n3. THE IMPACTS \n\nThis  section  reviews  the  impact  of  both  disasters\u2014the  December  2004  tsunami  in \nAceh and the March 2005 earthquake in Nias. \n\n3.1. Human Loss and IDPs \n\nWithin days of the December 2004 tsunami international news reports led the world \nto expect huge losses in Aceh. Nevertheless, it was several months before the world \nknew  of  the  real  extent  of  the  death  toll  and  the  numbers  missing,  and  of  the \ncontinuing  plight  of  internally  displaced  persons  (IDPs)  in  Aceh.  Indeed,  different \nagencies provided different numbers. The official death toll in Aceh was estimated at \nclose  to  167,000  by  the  Department  of  Social  Affairs  in  mid-March  2005,  and  the \nnumber  displaced  was  put  at  811,000,  of  whom  920  were  in  hospitals  while \napproximately 477,000 were living in refugee camps. Based on information collected \nduring  field  visits  and  interviews,  several  organisations  reported  that  children, \nwomen,  and  the  elderly  accounted  for  more  than  two-thirds  of  the  tsunami  victims \n(see  also  Athukorala  and  Resosudarmo,  2005).  This  meant  that  the  demographic \nstructure of many villages and towns hit by the tsunami had changed dramatically. By \n1 June 2005, the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, described the \nAceh tsunami as \u201cthe largest natural disaster the organisation has had to respond to \non  behalf  of  the  world  community,  in  the  60  years  of  our  existence\u201d  (UN  Press \nRelease SG/SM/9666 IHA/978, 6 January 2005). \n\nIn  contrast,  Nias  did  not  suffer  greatly  as  a  result  of  the  tsunami.  The  March \nearthquake  resulted  in  a  high  local  death  toll  which  was,  however,  small  in  total \ncompared to that in Aceh. The official BRR report reported that 850 people had been \nkilled and 6,000 injured (BRR Nias, 2005).  \n\nAs  noted  earlier,  in  response  to  the  need  for  accurate  demographic  data  after  the \ndisaster,  BPS  conducted  the  Aceh-Nias  population  census  (SPAN  2005)  in \nSeptember 2005 (Table 2). The earthquakes and tsunami displaced a total of almost \n900,000 people. In September 2005, almost 260,000 people still held IDP status. The \ndata indicate that the districts of Aceh Jaya, Aceh Barat, Aceh Besar, and the city of \nBanda Aceh suffered most from the tsunami. Table 3 provides rough estimates of the \nnumber of people killed and missing per region. Though it is impossible to determine \nthe  exact  numbers  more  precisely,  this  seems  to  provide  a  reasonably  accurate \npicture  of  the  overall  impact  in  terms  of  the  numbers  of  people  killed  and  missing. \nHowever,  the  impact  of  the  earthquakes  and  tsunami  was  indeed  concentrated  in \nthese areas. \n\n5 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\nIt is important to note that the relatively high percentage of IDPs on Simeulue Island \nwas  not  preceded  by  a  high  death  toll.  Only  seven  deaths  were  recorded  on  the \nisland despite the fact that Simeulue is situated only  about 100 kilometres from the \nepicentre  of  the  March  earthquake.  The  island  was  indeed  severely  hit  by  the \nDecember  tsunami:  approximately  5,500  houses  were  destroyed  and  hundreds  of \npeople were injured (Kompas, 1 April 2005). There are two probable explanations for \nthe relatively small number of fatalities. First, the coastal ecosystem\u2014the coral reef, \nsea  grass,  and  mangrove  forests\u2014softened  the  force  of  the  giant  waves.  Second, \nlocal  customs  and  traditions  on  the  island  include  important  information  about  the \nwarning signs of a tsunami: According to local tradition a tsunami is always preceded \nby the retreat of the sea, knowledge that has been transferred from one generation to \nanother.  Indeed,  the  retreat  of  the  sea  did  occur  on  the  morning  of  26  December \n2004. Local inhabitants who recognised the signs of an impending tsunami ran to the \nclosest hills shouting \u201csmong . . . smong . . . smong\u201d (tsunami in the local language). \nOthers  took  up  the  warning,  running  to  the  hills  while  contributing  to  the  chorus  of \n\u201csmong . . . smong . . . smong\u201d. This simple procedure proved to be very effective in \nSimeulue  when  the  tsunami  struck  (Wetlands  International\u2013Indonesia  Programme, \n2005; Kompas, 1 April 2005). Sadly, in other areas of Aceh and North Sumatra such \nsimple traditional mitigation procedures imbedded in local cultures had never existed \nor  had  been  long  forgotten.  The  experience  in  Simeulue  suggests  it  is  important  to \ndevelop programs strengthening local knowledge about natural disasters. One way of \ndoing so would be to introduce special training courses on natural disasters into the \nnational elementary education system across Indonesia. \n\nSPAN  2005  also  provided  information  on  the  impact  of  the  disaster  on  personal \nlivelihoods and the daily lives of affected people (Table 4). Almost 265,000 people in \nAceh  and  over  85,000  in  Nias  lost  their  sources  of  income;  over  190,000  people  in \nAceh  and  almost  62,000  in  Nias  lost  their  houses;  and  around  391,000  people  in \nAceh and 539,000 in Nias suffered damage to their houses.  \n\n3.2. Physical Impacts \n\nThe  immediate  physical  impacts  of  the  December  tsunami  in  Aceh  and  the  March \nearthquake in Nias were tremendous. The tsunami wiped out practically all physical \nobjects  in  many  parts  of  Aceh\u2019s  western  and  northern  coastal  areas,  flattening \nhundreds of thousands of houses, infrastructure of all kinds, and many other facilities \n(Table 5).  \n\nWhile  the  disasters  in  Aceh  and  Nias  wrought  similar  types  of  devastation  on  local \npeople,  there  was  an  important  difference  as  to  the  causes.  In  Aceh,  a  great  wave \nsmashed buildings, cars, trees, people, and everything else in its path. Most of those \nwho  were  able  to  climb  up  trees  or  onto  roofs  or  those  in  higher  storey  premises, \nsurvived. In Nias, the earthquake preceding the December tsunami did not do much \ndamage and caused few deaths. But things were quite different in March. The March \nearthquake  in  Nias  destroyed  numerous  buildings.  The  fact  that  the  March \nearthquake occurred when most people were asleep added to the toll because when \nthe earthquake struck, houses collapsed and many sleeping occupants were buried. \nIn  addition,  the  typical  construction  of  houses  in  urban  areas in  Nias also  added  to \nthe fatalities. As is the case in other towns in Indonesia, typical urban houses in Nias \nare  made  of  bricks  that  have  usually  replaced  previous  wooden  structures.  The \nfoundations  are  usually  not  sufficiently  strong  for  a  brick  structure  because \ncompliance  with  building  codes  is  mostly  lax.  Worse,  some  homeowners  add  a \nsecond storey imposing additional  strains  on  the  inadequate  foundations.  This  non-\ncompliance with building codes is the main reason why four out of five houses in Nias \nwere damaged (BRR Nias, 2005).  \n\n6 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\nIn  many  cases  in  poorer  areas  of  Aceh  and  Nias,  the  heavy  physical  damage  to \ninfrastructure  (such  as  falling  bridges)  was  apparently  due  to  the  low  quality  of  the \nstructures  or  insufficient  maintenance  rather  than  to  the  severity  of  the  natural \ndisasters.  In  rural  areas,  lack  of  proper  maintenance  probably  contributed  to  the \ndestruction  of  schools  or  health  facility  buildings.  In  December  2005,  the  BRR \nannounced its initial estimates of physical damage in Aceh and Nias caused by the \nnatural  disasters.  In  April  2006,  the  BRR  corrected  its  estimates  of  damages, \nparticularly regarding damages in Nias (Table 6). \n\n3.3. Economic Impacts \n\nThe World Bank\u2019s assessment of the total damage caused by the Aceh tsunami was \nUS$4.45 billion, almost equal to Aceh\u2019s GDP in 2003.5 Of this total, 60 per cent was \nestimated to be physical damage and 40 per  cent  was from losses of income flows \nthrough the economy. Almost 80 per cent of total damage and losses was borne by \nthe private sector while the rest was borne by the public sector (World Bank, 2005). \nThe Institute for Economic and Social Research (LPEM) at the Faculty of Economics, \nUniversity of Indonesia, estimated the total damage in Aceh to be slightly higher than \nthe  World  Bank\u2019s  estimate  at  US$4.6  billion  (LPEM,  2005).  The  World  Bank  also \nestimated the damage of the March earthquake in Nias to be around US$392 million. \nTherefore,  after  adjusting  for  predicted  inflation,  the  World  Bank  put  the  expected \ncost  of  repairing  the  damage  caused  by  the  two  disasters  at  around  US$5.8  billion \n(BRR and International Partners, 2005). \n\nAccording to the World Bank, Aceh\u2019s GDP in 2005 could contract by 7\u201328 per cent of \nthe 2004 level (World Bank, 2005). LPEM (2005) arrived at a slightly lower estimate \nthan the World Bank\u2019s upper estimate (22 per cent). The destruction in the province \nof North Sumatra was mainly concentrated in Nias, the poorest district in the province \nand one whose contribution to the overall regional economy is rather small. In Nias, \nthe  island  economy  was  predicted  to  contract  by  around  20  per  cent  (BRR  and \nInternational Partners, 2005). \n\nThe oil and gas industry in Aceh escaped the tsunami virtually unharmed. The most \nseriously  affected  sector  in  terms  of  both  the  number  of  casualties  and  capital \ndestroyed was agriculture, particularly fisheries. (Soesastro and Ace, 2005). \n\nAccording to information gathered by the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries, by \nmid-January  2005  approximately  55,000  fishermen  and  aquaculture  workers  were \nconfirmed  dead  (approximately  one-half  of  the  total  number  of  fishermen  in  Aceh) \nand around 14,000 were still missing. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization of \nthe United Nations (FAO) reported that 40\u201360 per cent of coastal aquaculture ponds \nalong  coastal  Aceh  and  between  36,000  and  48,000  hectares  of  brackish-water \naquaculture  ponds  (which  mainly  produced  shrimp  and  milkfish)  were  seriously \ndamaged.  It  is  estimated  that  about  65\u201370  per  cent  of  the  small-scale  fishing  fleet \nand associated gear was destroyed in Aceh (FAO, 2005a). \n\nIn Aceh about 30,000 hectares of rice fields\u2014around 10 per cent of the area under \nrice cultivation in the province\u2014were badly affected. Soil salinity problems were the \nmain  concern.  Fortunately,  because  of  humid  conditions,  salt-polluted  arable  land \nwas cleaned by rainfall and by irrigation water relatively quickly. A survey carried out \nby  FAO  in  early  2005  indicated  that  salt  deposited  in  more  than  two-thirds  of  the \n\n                                                 \n5 The World Bank's estimate was based on a standard assessment technique developed by \nthe United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC, \n2003). \n\n7 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\naffected  agricultural  land  was  leached  out  within  a  few  months  allowing  planting  to \nresume  in  April  and  May  2005.  It  was  estimated  that  only  9,000  hectares  could  no \nlonger be used for farming (China View, 31 March 2005; FAO, 2005b). \n\nThe  impact  of  the  decline  in  Aceh\u2019s  GDP  on  Indonesia\u2019s  overall  economic \nperformance is expected to be small. Both the World Bank and the LPEM estimated \nthat Indonesia\u2019s GDP growth in 2005 was expected to be no more than around half a \nper cent less than the pre-tsunami growth forecast (World Bank, 2005; LPEM, 2005). \nAn increase in poverty is probably the most serious economic problem caused by the \ntsunami  and  earthquake.  In  2004,  the  Indonesian  Central  Agency  of  Statistics \ncalculated  that  almost  30  per  cent  of  people  in  Aceh  were  living  below  the  poverty \nline. LPEM predicted that this figure could grow to around 50 per cent. \n\n4. THE IMMEDIATE RESPONSE \n\n4.1. Rescue and Relief \n\nIn  the  first  couple  of  days  after  the  tsunami,  little  information  was  received  by  the \noutside world so initial rescue operations were relatively limited and slow. In this early \nstage, local people had to depend on their own resources to survive for some days \nbefore  Indonesian  government  agencies  responded.  Soon  after,  when  the  outside \nworld  started  to  realise  what  had  happened,  international  responses  began  to  get \nunderway. It is worth noting that during this first week, the Indonesian military\u2014which \nhas come under some criticism for their military operations in Aceh\u2014provided crucial \nassistance in conducting rescue and relief operations and in helping to cope with the \nlarge number of dead. \n\nBy the beginning of the second week the numbers of domestic and international aid \norganisations arriving in Aceh increased significantly. Although there  was reportedly \nsome lack of coordination between these organisations, the fact that they were able \nto provide relief for the tsunami victims was much more important. In the third week, \nthe number of international organisations arriving in Aceh continued to rise\u2014around \n250 domestic and international organisations sent workers to Aceh. Countless others \nprovided  other  types  of  assistance  (Sen  and  Steer,  2005;  Indrawati,  2005).  The \nmedia  also  played  a  very  important  role  by  attracting  these  domestic  and \ninternational supports. \n\nBy  mid-February  2005,  the  UN  Office  for  the  Coordination  of  Humanitarian  Affairs \n(OCHA) recorded that total pledges and commitments from over thirty countries and \nvarious  organisations  had  reached  approximately  US$800  million  (OCHA,  2005). \nAround  2.3  million  people  were  directly  affected  by  the  disaster  so  the  aid \ncontribution for rescue and relief activities per person was about US$350. The norm \nin  previous  international  fundraising  attempts  in  the  face  of  natural  disasters  in \ndeveloping  countries  has  been  a  mere  US$40  per  person  (Economist,  5  February \n2005; Athukorala and Resosudarmo, 2005).  \n\nThe Indonesian central government also responded quickly by announcing at the end \nof December 2004 that the government would release approximately US$5 million to \nsupport  relief  activities.  The  Government  also  announced  that  it  would  support \noperations  in  three  phases:  (1)  emergency  rescue  and  relief  operations,  (2) \nrehabilitation  and \ninfrastructure  and \nreconstruction  of  basic  socioeconomic \nrestoration of law and order, and (3) reconstruction of the economy and government \nsystem. The first phase was completed by April 2005. The second phase has been in \nprogress since April 2005 and was expected to last for around two  years. The third \n\n8 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\nphase  will  take  around  three  to  five  more  years  (BRR  and  International  Partners, \n2005).6  \n\nIt  can  be  said  that  the  relief  efforts  conducted  by  both  domestic  and  international \norganisations  provided  great  physical  and  financial  assistance.  It  should  also  be \nnoted,  however,  that  local  people  were  obliged  to  depend  on  their  own  resources \nduring  the  first  couple  of  days  after  the  disaster.  This fact  shows  the  importance  of \nestablishing strong and resilient local communities. \n\n4.2. Funding  \n\nThe  international  focus  on  victims  of  the  Aceh  tsunami  as  well  as  the  Nias \nearthquake continued well beyond the initial relief period. The Paris Club of creditor \nnations  at  its  meeting  in  Paris  on  12  January  2005  declared  a  moratorium  on  the \nforeign  debt  of  the  tsunami-hit  countries.  Some  key  players  in  the  international  aid \ncommunity, including World Bank President James Wolfensohn, suggested that debt \nwrite-offs would be preferable to debt deferral. However this proposal was not agreed \nto on the grounds that that it might raise moral hazard issues: countries absolved of \ndebt might be tempted to borrow excessively in the future in the expectation that they \nwould  eventually  be  bailed  out  if,  for  some  reason,  they  had  difficulties  in  meeting \nrepayments.  The  IMF  and  World  Bank  officially  endorsed  the  moratorium  and  the \nmajor international credit-rating agencies agreed that they would not regard deferral \nof  debt  service  payments  as  a  negative  factor  in  their  risk  assessments  and  credit \nratings.  Subsequently,  the  IMF  and  the  World  Bank  also  announced  considerable \ndebt  relief  for  the  affected  countries,  particularly  the  Maldives,  Sri  Lanka,  and \nIndonesia (Soesastro and Ace, 2005; Economist, 5 February 2005). \n\nMembers  of  the  Consultative  Group  on  Indonesia  (CGI)  at  a  meeting  convened \nhurriedly on 19\u201320 January 2005 agreed to contribute US$1.7 billion in 2005 for the \nreconstruction  of  Aceh.  Of  this  amount,  US$1.2  billion  was  promised  in  the form  of \ngrants and the remaining US$0.5 billion  was pledged  as soft loans at  zero or near-\nzero  interest  rates.  Of  the  US$1.2  billion  in  grants,  only  US$0.2  billion  was  to  be \ndistributed  through  the  Indonesian  Government.  The  rest  was  to  be  distributed \nthrough non-governmental organisations (NGOs) (Soesastro and Ace, 2005).  \n\nfor  emergency \n\nto  provide  grants \n\nIn February 2005, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) set up a US$600 million Asian \nTsunami  Fund \ntechnical  assistance  and \nreconstruction  projects.  Indonesia  would  receive  half  of  the  grant,  divided  into \nUS$290  million  for  the  Earthquake  and  Tsunami  Emergency  Support  Project \n(ETESP) and US$10 million as the ADB\u2019s contribution to the Multi Donor Fund (MDF) \nfor  Aceh-Nias.  The  ETESP \nto  support  disaster  management, \nreconstruction, and rehabilitation in affected areas of Aceh and North Sumatra. The \nsectoral  targets  of  the  grant  include  agriculture,  fisheries,  micro  and  small \nenterprises,  health,  education,  water  supply,  irrigation,  housing,  power,  roads,  and \nspatial planning (ADB, 2006).  \n\nintended \n\nis \n\nCommitments  from  various  countries,  organizations,  and  private  individuals  to \nsupport  the  reconstruction  effort  were  considered  generous.  For  example,  Australia \nagreed  to  provide  financial  support  amounting  to  about  A$1  billion\u2014A$500  million \nwas expected to be  in the form of grants and A$500 million in soft loans\u2014over the \nperiod  2005\u20132010.  According  to  records  maintained  by  the  BRR,  78  countries,  30 \norganisations,  and  many  individual  donors  pledged  support  (both  grants  and  soft \n\n                                                 \n6 There is no clear information yet on when the third phase will be ended. The current \nmandate of BRR to coordinate reconstruction in Aceh-Nias, however, will be ended in 2009. \n\n9 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\nloans)  of  around  US$6.1  billion  in  total  by  November  2005.  The  total  amount  given \nthrough direct private contributions was quite large; according to some estimates, this \namounted to US$2.5 billion out of the total donor pledges. In some cases, such as in \nthe  United  Kingdom,  United  States,  and  Italy,  private  contributions  exceeded \ngovernment contributions by a wide margin (BRR and International Partners, 2005).  \n\nA multi-donor trust fund for Aceh-Nias, the MDF, was established by the Indonesian \nGovernment in early 2005. The main goal of this fund was to attract and pool bilateral \nand  other  resources  so  as  to  ensure  a  coordinated  approach  to  the  support  of \nrehabilitation activities in Aceh and Nias.7 Contributions were also expected from the \nprivate sector, foundations, and NGOs. The fund was designed to support two types \nof activities (MDF, 2005): \n\n1.  New  projects  or  new  components  of  existing  projects,  including  the  co-\nfinancing  of  existing  or  new  projects  supported  by  multilateral  agencies  or \nother financiers. \n\n2.  Assistance for  government  programs  that  were  part  of  the  rehabilitation  and \n\nreconstruction efforts.  \n\nBy  January  2006  about  66  per  cent  of  the  US$530  million  pledges  had  been \nformalised  in  the  form  of  a  contribution  agreement  and  the  MDF  had  received \nUS$229 million in cash. Disbursements had been made to seven projects amounting \nto  US$79  million.  These  projects  included  land  titling,  rural  and  urban  community \nrecovery, housing and settlements, waste management, and technical assistance to \nthe BRR. By December 2006 the amount provided to the fund had reached US$655 \nmillion with pledges from fifteen donors (Table 7). About 77 per cent of these pledges \nhad  been  formalised  in  the  form  of  contribution  agreements  and  approximately \nUS$480  million  had  been  allocated  to  17  projects  in  four  sectors:  recovery  of \ncommunities,  infrastructure  and  transport,  capacity  building  and  governance,  and \nsustainable  management  of  the  environment.  Disbursement  to  these  projects  had \nreached around US$170 million (http://www.multidonorfund.org/).  \n\nThe  Indonesian  Government  also  provided  large-scale  support  for  reconstruction  in \nAceh  and  Nias.  The  2005  government  budget  allocation  for  Aceh\u2019s  reconstruction \n(which  included  some  of  the  funding  received  from  international  agencies)  was \napproximately  US$880  million  (Kompas,  27  August  2005)  and  in  2006  was \napproximately  US$960  million.  Over  five  years,  the  total  government  budget  for \nAceh\u2019s reconstruction, including government loans, is expected to be around US$3 to \nUS$4 billion (Tempo Interactive, 27 March 2005).  \n\nIn  total,  according  to  the  BRR,  the  composition  of  funding  commitments  for \nrehabilitation and reconstruction activities until 2009 is as follows:  \n\nDomestic sources through the government budget   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n      US$ Billion \n\n   3.0 \n\n   3.6 \n\n \n\nForeign governments  \n\n                                                 \n7 The MDF is co-chaired by the BRR, the European Commission (EC) as the largest donor, \nand the World Bank as the Trustee. The steering committee of this fund comprises the \nGovernment of Indonesia, contributors, civil society, and other international NGOs and the \nUN. The broad representation of the steering committee was expected to allow the MDF to \nact as a donor coordination mechanism and a forum for dialogue on recovery policy between \nthe Government of Indonesia and the international community. \n\n10 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\nPrivate sector and NGOs \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   2.5 \n\n   9.1 \n\n \n\nThis total amount of over US$9 billion, which is much larger than the initial estimate \nof damages and losses, reflects an intention to \u201cbuild back better\u201d in Aceh and Nias. \nBy  the  end  of  2005  around  US$4.4  billion  had  been  allocated  to  specific  projects \n(BRR and International Partners, 2005).  \n\n5. FOUNDATIONS FOR RECOVERY \n\nAs  noted  earlier,  the  Indonesian  Government  responded  to  the  disasters  in  three \nmain  phases:  (1)  emergency  rescue  and  relief  operations,  (2)  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction of basic socioeconomic infrastructure and restoration of law and order, \nand  (3)  reconstruction  of  the  economy  and  government  system.  Due  to  the  difficult \neconomic and political conditions of Aceh and the sheer magnitude of the destruction \nof  its  infrastructure,  the  first  phase  of  crisis  management  took  much  longer  than \nexpected.  \n\nWith  the  second  phase,  there  were  three  main  concerns  regarding  the  process  of \nreconstruction.  The  first  was  the  need  to  coordinate  the  activities  conducted  by  the \nvery  large  number  of  official  and  other  agencies  active  in  the  field.  The  national \ngovernment  appointed  Bappenas  as  the  central  agency  for  developing  recovery \nplanning  for  the  tsunami-affected  areas.  The  main  challenge  for  Bappenas  was  to \ndevelop  a  master  plan  that  satisfied  all  of  the  main  institutions  working  in  the \nprovince. For a considerable time, dialogue between Bappenas on the one hand, and \nlocal  governments  in  the  region  on  the  other,  was  rather  limited.  Lacking  direct \ninvolvement in much of the planning process, many local governments felt that they \nhad been excluded from the reconstruction process by the central government. As a \nresult,  local  governments  had  drawn  up  programs  that  in  some  cases  were \nincompatible  with  Bappenas  plans.  At  times,  this  led  to  duplication  of  activities  and \nthe inefficient utilisation of funds.  \n\nThere  were  also  cases  of  poor  coordination  of  activities  between  NGOs  and \nBappenas.  Many  NGOs  resisted  accepting  plans  that  emanated  exclusively  from \nBappenas.  Indeed,  several  groupings  of  NGOs  developed  their  own  reconstruction \nprograms  for  Aceh  and  Nias  although  it  was  not  clear  how  they  intended  to  relate \nthese plans to those of Bappenas or local governments.  \n\nto  coordinate \n\nrecovery  activities.  However \n\nIn  these  difficult  circumstances  the  Indonesian  national  government  decided  to \nestablish  a  new  agency \nlocal \ngovernments, communities, and private sector firms as well as NGOs were not very \nkeen  on  this  approach.  They  were  worried  that  this  new  agency  would  add  an \nadditional  bureaucratic  layer  to  the  problems  of  working  in  Aceh.  They  were  also \nconcerned that construction work would be tendered in Jakarta and would be won by \nlarge  construction  companies  with  good  connections  to  high-ranking  officers  in  the \ncentral  government  and  that  the  implementation  of  these  activities  would  be \nconducted  without  proper  attention  to  the  needs  of  local  people.  Local  people  and \nNGOs  therefore  pressed  for  a  more  decentralised  approach  (Athukorala  and \nResosudarmo, 2005). \n\nA  second  concern  related  to  security  conditions  in  Aceh.  The  three  decades  of \nconflict  between  the  Free  Aceh  Movement  (GAM)  and  the  Indonesian  Government \nhad held back development in the province and had severely limited the flow of news \n\n11 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\nout of Aceh, both to other parts of Indonesia as well as to the rest of the world. For \nexample, it was not until 28 December 2004\u2014two days after the tsunami\u2014that most \nof Indonesia and the rest of the world knew how badly the tsunami had hit Aceh. In \ncontrast,  news  of  the  scale  of  the  disaster  in  Sri  Lanka  and  Thailand  reached  the \ninternational  media  almost  immediately.  Poor  roads  and  telecommunications  also \nmade  it  difficult  to  provide  speedy  assistance  to  many  villages  along  the  coast  of \nAceh. Additionally, there were worries that the ongoing political conflict would hinder \nreconstruction operations. \n\nA  third  concern  was  to  ensure  that  commitments  pledged  by  international  donors \nwould  materialise  in  a  timely  manner.  For  various  reasons  beyond  the  control  of \nIndonesian  officials,  there  was  a  risk  that  some  of  the  commitments  would  never \ntranslate into actual aid flows. It is also true, however, that limitations on Indonesia\u2019s \nability  to  absorb  aid  quickly  were  relevant.  For  these  and  other  reasons,  it  soon \nbecame apparent that it was very important for Indonesian officials and local NGOs \nto  work  effectively  with  donors  to minimise  the  mismatch  between  donors\u2019 interests \non  the  one  hand  and  local  reconstruction  priorities  on  the  other  (Athukorala  and \nResosudarmo, 2005). \n\n5.1. The Master Plan  \n\nThe  central  government  seemed  to  understand  the  need  for  more  effective \ncoordination  with  local governments and NGOs as well as for a more decentralised \napproach  to  the  reconstruction  effort.  From  March  2005  onwards,  Bappenas \nconducted  intensive  consultations  with  community  and  political  leaders  in  the \naffected  areas  as  well  as  with  NGOs  and  donors.  Syiah  Kuala  University  in  Banda \nAceh  was  given  assistance  to  organise  input  from  local  communities  into  the \nconsultation process while central and local government line agencies also provided \nexpertise. Donors were also encouraged to contribute suggestions. The Master Plan \nthat  resulted  was  quite  comprehensive  though  the  central  government  recognised \nthat  no  one  plan  could  address  every  issue  likely  to  arise  in  the  rehabilitation \nprocess.8  \n\nNevertheless,  despite  the  extensive  consultations,  many  local  communities  and \nNGOs reacted negatively  to the  Master Plan.  Many local communities felt that  their \naspirations  had  not  been  properly  reflected.  In  response,  as  a  conciliatory  gesture \nonly a couple of days after his inauguration in April 2005, the new Head of the BRR, \nDr.  Kuntoro,  agreed  that  many  aspects  had  not  been  adequately  covered  in  the \nMaster  Plan.  He  indicated  that  the  BRR  would  not  follow  the  plan  to  the  letter  and \nthat rather, it would be used as a reference document in a flexible way  (Kompas, 3 \nMay 2005). The local Head of the BRR in Nias also agreed that the Master Plan was \nnot  necessarily  a  suitable  strategy  for  redevelopment  in  Nias  (Kompas,  19  August \n2005). It was therefore soon agreed that an evolutionary approach would be adopted \nand that there would not be any single rigid \u201cblueprint approach\u201d that would guide the \nprocess  of  reconstruction  (Indrawati,  2005; World  Bank,  2005).  For  example,  under \nthe new approach communities were to be provided with opportunities to participate \nin decision-making about where, how, and by whom houses and other buildings were \nto  be  reconstructed.  The  central  government  would  concentrate  on  the  provision  of \nprincipal  infrastructure  facilities  such  as  main  roads,  electricity  and  water  sanitation \nstructures.  Earlier  plans  that  had  outlined  regulations  for  tough  zoning,  mandatory \n\n                                                 \n8 The Master Plan was released through the President Regulation (Perpres) No. 34/2005 in \nApril 2005. The main book, which was effectively an extended summary of the whole study, \ncomprised 129 pages. The sectoral information which is the detailed version of the Master \nPlan comprised twelve books totalling 1,400 pages. \n\n12 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\nsetbacks  from  the  sea,  relocation  of  local  markets,  and  so  on  were  set  aside. \nLeaders in Jakarta committed themselves to ensuring that local people in Aceh and \nNias  were  involved  in  the decision-making  processes  about  such matters (Sen  and \nSteer, 2005). In this way, disagreements between the central government on the one \nhand and local governments and communities on the other were kept to a minimum. \nIf  the  reconstruction  process  in  Aceh  turns  out  to  be  successful  over  the  long-term \nthere  is  a  strong  likelihood  that  this  pattern  of  strong  collaboration  between \nstakeholders will be adopted as the blueprint for regional development in other parts \nof Indonesia. \n\n5.2. The Aceh-Nias Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency (BRR) \n\nThe  central  government  preferred  to  set  up  a  special  Aceh-Nias  Rehabilitation  and \nReconstruction  Board  as  a  one-stop  shop  for  the  coordination  of  all  agencies  and \ndonors  in  Aceh  and  Nias.  There  was  no  strong  objection  from  local  governments, \ncommunities, NGOs, and international donors to this decision. There were two main \nreasons  for  this.  First,  the  central  government  had  shown  that  it  was  willing  to \ncollaborate with local stakeholders as well as donors in developing the Master Plan \nand  to  be  flexible  in  implementing  the  plan.  Second,  the  person  appointed  to  head \nthe BRR, as well as the deputies, had a reputation for being \u201cclean\u201d and capable.  \n\nIn  April  2005  the  Government  embarked  on  the  second  phase  of  recovery \noperations.  On  16  April  2005,  the  Government  established  the  Badan  Rekonstruksi \ndan  Rehabilitasi  (BRR)  Aceh-Nias,  with  the  stated  mission  of  restoring  livelihoods \nand  strengthening  communities  in  Aceh  and  Nias  by  overseeing  a  coordinated, \ncommunity-driven  reconstruction  and  development  program.  Initially,  the  BRR  was \nestablished as a coordinating rather than executive agency to operate for a four-year \nperiod. It is based in Banda Aceh, with a branch office in Nias and a representative \noffice  in  Jakarta.  Operationally,  the  BRR  comprises  three  bodies:  the  Executive \nAgency  (Badan  Pelaksana  or  Bapel),  the  high-level  Advisory  Board  (Badan \nPengarah),  and  the  Supervisory  Board  (Badan  Pengawas).  Since  the  end  of  2005, \nthe BRR has received an additional mandate to build around 120,000 houses in Aceh \nand  Nias  starting  in  2006.  With  this  mandate,  the  BRR  to  some  extent  took  over \nresponsibilities  earlier  given  to  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  (Tempo  Interaktif,  26 \nDecember 2005). \n\nThe  organisational  structure  of  the  BRR,  since  mid-2006,  can  be  seen  in  Figure  3. \nThe Executive Agency (Bapel), commonly referred to by  the term BRR, is the body \nresponsible  for  managing  the  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  activities.  The  BRR \nhas four main offices and several regional offices. This structure is much leaner than \nin the initial period of its establishment.  \n\nThe  BRR  has  an  Advisory  Board  chaired  by  the  Coordinating  Minister  for  Political \nand  Security  Affairs.  This  board  consists  of  17  representatives  from  central  and \nregional  governments,  religious  and  adat  (local  custom)  institutions,  and  other \nparticipants  from  civil  society.  It  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  aspirations  of \nagencies  and  groups  that  they  represent  are  reflected  in  the  BRR's  operational \nplanning.  The  Supervisory  Board,  meanwhile,  consists  of  nine  members  appointed \nby the President. It is made up of community representatives and technical advisers, \nincluding  representatives  of  donor  organisations.  This  board  is  responsible  for \nensuring that the reconstruction and rehabilitation activities are carried out effectively \nin  a  manner  corresponding  with  the  needs  of  local  people  (Kuncoro  and \nResosudarmo, 2006). \n\n13 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\n5.3. Peace Agreement \n\nOne of the few unexpected benefits of the bitter wind brought with the tsunami was a \nnew willingness among political disputing parties in Aceh to cease military hostilities, \nand  later  to  begin  negotiations.  The  Government  of  Indonesia  and  the  GAM \nunderstood that a peace treaty was an essential part of a successful reconstruction \nprocess  in  Aceh.  A  series  of  talks  was  conducted  to  bring  about  the  process. \nFacilitated by the former President of Finland, Martti Ahtisaari, GAM and Indonesian \ngovernment officials commenced talks in February 2005 and signed an official peace \nagreement just six months later on 15 August 2005. The agreement provided for the \ncessation of all hostilities between the Government of Indonesia and the GAM. Key \npoints of the agreement included the following (World Bank, 2006a): \n\n\u2022  The  Government  of  Indonesia  and  GAM  would  cease  all  hostilities;  to  this \nend,  the  Government  of  Indonesia  would  withdraw  non-local  military  and \npolice forces from Aceh by the end of 2005. \n\n\u2022  GAM  would  decommission  all  arms,  demobilise  its  3,000  troops,  and \n\nsurrender 840 weapons. \n\nbased political parties. \n\n\u2022  The  Government  of  Indonesia  would  facilitate  the  establishment  of  Aceh-\n\n\u2022  Aceh would be governed under a new special law and would be entitled to 70 \n\nper cent of revenues from its natural resources. \n\n\u2022  GAM members and political prisoners would be granted amnesty. \n\n\u2022  A  human  rights  court  and  a  truth  and  reconciliation  commission  would  be \n\n\u2022  An  Aceh  Monitoring  Mission  (AMM)  would  be  established  by  the  EU  and \n\nestablished. \n\nASEAN. \n\nFollowing  the  agreement,  GAM  surrendered  all  weapons  and  the  Government  of \nIndonesia withdrew all non-local military and police by the end of 2005. The EU and \nASEAN  oversaw  the  disarmament  process  by  establishing  the  Aceh  Monitoring \nMission. A presidential decree was later issued granting amnesty to GAM members \nin  exile  in  other  countries  and  about  1,400  GAM  members  were  released \nunconditionally  from  jails.  The  Government  of  Indonesia  agreed  to  facilitate  the \nformation  of  a  local  political  party,  which  would  participate  in  the  election  of  local \nregional government representatives (World Bank, 2006a; World Bank, 2006b). \n\nTo  reintegrate  ex-GAM  personnel  into  the  community,  the  Indonesian  Government \nagreed to provide assistance in both cash and kind. Each ex-combatant and released \nprisoner was to receive Rp5 million support (around US$500) in the form of cash and \nin kind from the Indonesian Government. It was estimated that around 3,000 ex-GAM \ncombatants and 1,400 political prisoners would receive this support.  \n\nAt  the  implementation  stage,  the  planned  package  for  former  combatants  was \nchanged  due  to  difficulties  in  providing  rigorous  proof  of  eligibility.  Hence,  the \nGovernment of Indonesia distributed three rounds of Rp1 million per person (around \nUS$100) of livelihood assistance as a form of minimum social security.  \n\n14 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\nIn reality, as reported by the World Bank, the actual amount received by each former \nGAM member was much less, often being only around Rp170,000\u2013260,000 (US$18\u2013\n30).  This  is  because  ex-GAM  leaders  included  orphans  and  widows  in  their \ncalculation  of  who  should  receive  support,  resulting  in  a  greater  number  of  people \nclaiming  assistance.  The  process  of  allocating  the  amount  of  money  involved  local \npeople and was relatively transparent so that in general this approach was accepted \nwithout trouble (World Bank, 2006a).  \n\nThe peace agreement, nevertheless, had several immediate side effects. It refueled \nefforts  to  form  new  provinces  in  Aceh  by  sub-dividing  Aceh  into  several  separate \nprovinces. Since early 2000 various groups had aspired to form new provinces within \nAceh. The two most favoured new provinces were Aceh Leuser Antara (consisting of \nAceh Tengah, Aceh Tenggara, Aceh Singkil, Gayo Lues, and Bener Meriah districts) \nand  Aceh  Barat  Selatan  (consisting  of  Aceh  Barat,  Aceh  Selatan,  Simeulue,  Aceh \nBarat Daya, Aceh Jaya, and Nagan Raya districts). The symbolic declaration of these \ntwo new provinces was made by several local government officers, local parliament \nmembers,  and  informal  leaders  in  these  eleven  districts  before  thousands  of \nsupporters  in  Jakarta  on  4  December  2005  (Kompas,  6  December  2005  and  14 \nAugust 2006).  \n\nThe central government, however, is ambivalent about these plans to establish new \nprovinces. Law 32 of 2004 on Regional Government allows for the formation of new \nadministrative units, although, in practice, the exact mechanism involved is not clear. \nIn  various  interviews  officials  from  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  have  said  that \nconsideration of the division of current Aceh into new provinces still has a long way to \ngo.  The  current  provincial  government  of  Aceh  has  also  maintained  an  ambivalent \nposition delaying recommendations to the central government for the formation of the \nnew  provinces.  Moreover,  the  ex-GAM  activists  who  supported  the  Helsinki  MoU \nwere  also  opposed  to  the  division  of  Aceh  into  several  provinces  because  the \nHelsinki MoU states that the borders of Aceh correspond to those of 1 July 1956, and \nas such constitute the current province of Aceh. This reluctance may also be seen as \na way for ex-GAM activists to maintain useful bargaining power.  \n\nOn  11  December  2006,  almost  two  years  after  the  tsunami,  for  the  first  time  in \nIndonesian  history  the  Acehnese  people  voted  to  directly  elect  their  own  governor \nand  district/municipality  heads.  The  election  process  was  widely  judged  as \nsuccessful.  There  were  no  major  conflicts,  the  division  of  Aceh  did  not  become  an \nissue,  and  the  participation  rate  was  very  high.  Interestingly,  a  prominent  ex-GAM \nmember, Irwandi Yusuf, won the election to be Governor of Aceh from 2007 to 2012. \nThe success  of  this  election  and  the  fact  that  an  ex-GAM  member  was  able  to  win \nthe election were promising signs that the peace agreement might eventually lead to \na truly peaceful and democratic environment in Aceh. \n\n6. REHABILITATION, RECONSTRUCTION, AND RECOVERY \n\nThe BRR commenced operations in  May  2005 and began  to implement the agreed \nplans for rebuilding housing, infrastructure, and livelihoods. It followed the sequence \nof  emergency  and  recovery  activities  shown  in  Figure  4.  The  plan  was  that  the \nintensive  relief  operations  that  began  in  early  2005  would  be  wound  down  by  mid-\n2005 and formally ended in mid-2007. The main priority in the early period was to be \nhouse  building.  House  building  activities  were  expected  to  peak  at  the  end  of  2006 \nand  be  completed  by  the  end  of  2007.  The  second  priority  in  the  early  period  was \nrebuilding  livelihoods.  Rebuilding  infrastructure  would  take  longer\u2014only  limited \nactivity  was  expected  until  2006,  but  the  activity  was  then  expected  to  intensify \n\n15 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\nrapidly  and  become  the  main  priority  from  mid-2006  onwards.  The  process  of \nrebuilding livelihoods and infrastructure was expected to be mostly complete by  the \nend of 2009. \n\n6.1. Land Titles \n\nSignificantly, the tsunami changed much of the physical landscape in some parts of \nAceh.  Not  only  were  houses  destroyed  but  worse,  in  many  places  boundaries  and \nreference marks of land simply disappeared. Although less tragic than losing family \nmembers, the loss of land is one of the greatest blows that can befall an Acehnese \nfamily. For many people, land is their most valuable physical asset. In many cases, \nhowever, the legal documents of ownership were lost after the disaster. The changes \nthe tsunami made to the contours of the landscape in some places also complicated \nclaims  of  land  ownership.  There  was  also  a  risk  of  land-grabbing.  In  urban  areas \nland-grabbing was more likely to affect the more vulnerable groups: women, children, \nand  orphans.  Because  of  all  these  concerns,  tsunami  survivors  were  sometimes \nseen  installing  markers  on  land  where  they  believed  their  house  had  stood.  In \ncontrast, problems with land titles were much less serious in Nias. The earthquake in \nNias caused houses to collapse but proprietary  landmarks were unchanged. Where \ndifficulties for individuals were concerned, land title problems in Nias were limited to \nthe loss of legal documents. \n\nLooking  to  the  future,  the  protection  of  land  rights  is  a  high  priority.  Land  rights \nprovide  the  foundation  for  spatial  planning,  compensation,  and  long-term  economic \ndevelopment.  Indeed,  already  there  have  been  some  important  cases  where \nreconstruction activities have been delayed because people in the affected area were \nnot  satisfied  with  the  arrangements  under  which ownership  rights  to  land  had  been \nassigned for construction activities.  \n\nIn response to this serious problem of land ownership, a US$28.5 million Multi-Donor \nFund  project  for  the  Reconstruction  of  Aceh  Land  Administration  System  (RALAS) \nwas  launched  in  August  2005.  RALAS  has  two  major  components:  first,  the \nreconstruction  of  property  rights  and  the  issuance  of  land  titles,  and  second,  the \nreconstruction  of  a  land  administration  office  in  Aceh.  The  project,  executed  by  the \nNational  Land  Administration  Agency  (Badan  Pertanahan  National  or  BPN),  is \ndesigned  to  identify  land  ownership  and  to  issue  land  titles  through  establishing  a \ncommunity  land  inventory,  recovering  land  records,  and  establishing  a  land \ndatabase.  It  is  estimated  that  when  the  project  is  finished  in  2008,  about  600,000 \nland titles will have been issued in Aceh and Nias (http://www.multidonorfund.org/).  \n\nProject  implementation  was  expected  to  take  place  in  several  stages.  First, \ncommunity  land  mapping  would  be  arranged,  facilitated  with  the  support  of  NGOs. \nAfter  that,  a  team  from  BPN  would  arrange  adjudication  procedures  that  measured \nthe  land  parcels  and  validated  ownership  and  boundary  demarcations.  BPN  would \nthen issue public notifications of adjudication, and provided there were no objections, \nBPN would subsequently issue the land titles. Under the RALAS project all services \nwere to be provided free of charge.  \n\nThe  first  supervision  team  fielded  in  November  2005  observed  that  progress  had \nbeen slow. The team noted that there had been delays on the part of the Indonesian \nMinistry of Finance in signing regulations for the  waiver of taxes and other charges \nrelating  to  the  issuance  of  land  titles.  However  the  supervision  team  remained \noptimistic that the 2006 targets would still be met. The team also noted that the first \ncomponent of RALAS was more advanced than the second. By end of 2006, about \n17,400  land  titles  had  been  signed  and  134,300  land  parcels  had  been  measured \n\n16 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\n(BRR  and  Partners,  2006).  This  was  certainly  an  achievement,  demonstrating  that \nlocal  communities  can  effectively  resolve  such  problems  at  grass  root  levels \n(UNORC, 2006).  \n\n6.2. Housing  \n\nMajor  housing  rehabilitation,  resettlement  of  displaced  people,  and  restoration  of \nbasic  utilities  only  began  in  mid-May  2005.  According  to  SPAN  2005  data,  around \n66,700 displaced families (almost 300,000 IDPs) in Aceh and around 62,600 (around \n340,000  IDPs)  in  Nias  had  returned  to  their  areas  by  September  2005  (Table  8). \nHowever  in  Aceh  only  around  7,000  families  (who  were  no  longer  considered \ninternally displaced) and around 5,000 families in Nias had received new houses by \nthis time. Most of the others (around 59,000 families in Aceh and 57,000 families in \nNias)  returned  to  their  old  properties  even  though  their  houses  had  not  yet  been \nrenovated or rebuilt. For these people the first priority was to reclaim their properties \nand then wait until it was their turn for their houses to be rebuilt or renovated. Many \nfamilies had to rent houses or stay with relatives.  \n\nDuring the second half of 2005 building activity  gathered pace. The BRR estimated \nthat  by  October  2005  around  10,000  houses  had  been  built,  by  December  around \n16,000,  by  April  2006  around  42,000,  and  by  December  2006  around  57,000  had \nbeen  completed  (Table  6).  However,  although  activity  accelerated  in  2006,  the \nnumber  of  houses  completed  was  expected  to  be  well  behind  the  BRR  target  of \n90,000\u2013100,000 houses completed by the end of 2006.  \n\nThe  total  estimated  budget  committed  by  donors  and  the  Government  of  Indonesia \nfor  housing  was  almost  US$976 million.  Initially  the  BRR  estimated  that  the  cost  of \nbuilding a 36 square metre house was around US$3,000. Meanwhile, compensation \nto rehabilitate damaged houses varied, but for planning purposes the upper limit was \nalso  set  at  US$3,000.  With  this  figure  in  mind,  it  was  estimated  that  the  total \ncommitted  funding  for  housing  would  be  enough  to  build  or  rehabilitate  around \n200,000 houses (BRR and International Partners, 2005).  \n\nHowever there were significant cost escalations. By the end of 2005 it was reported \nthat  the  cost  of  building  a  new  36  square  metre  house  had  increased  to  around \nUS$5,000 (BRR and International Partners, 2005). Table 9 illustrates the significant \nincrease \nthe  disasters. \nConsequently, by early 2006, the BRR revised their estimate of the cost of a new 36 \nsquare metre house to around US$4,000 (BRR and International Partners, 2005).9  \n\nin  building  costs  compared \n\nthe  situation  before \n\nto \n\nin  Yogyakarta/Indonesia  after \n\nWhy did construction costs rise after the tsunami? The issue of cost increases is an \nimportant one because recent reports from other places in the world hit by disasters \n(Pakistan,  US/Katrina,  and  even \nthe  Yogya \nearthquake) indicate that sharp cost increases in disaster zones are not unusual. But \nunusual  or  not,  it  is  important  to  establish  whether  the  cost  increases  reflected \nplausible  economic  factors  or,  instead,  unacceptable  profiteering.  Looking  at  the \ncomponents  of  construction  costs  in  an  effort  to  find  answers,  it  is  notable  that \nincreases  in  labour  costs  in  Aceh  and  Nias  were  not  as  markedly  high  as  the \nincrease in prices in some other material inputs. It seems, therefore, that the supply \nof labour was apparently more elastic than the supply of materials. One likely reason \nfor  this  is  that  the  peace  agreement  in  Aceh  quickly  led  to  an  improvement  in  the \nsecurity  situation  in  the  region.  Hence,  workers  from  elsewhere  in  Indonesia  were \n\n                                                 \n9 BRR might predict that the cost per house only temporarily increased and so the average \ncost per house in 2006 would be around US$4,000.  \n\n17 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\napparently willing to move to Aceh for only small premiums over their existing wages. \nIn addition, North Sumatra, adjacent to Aceh, is a relatively labour abundant region; it \nbecame  the  main  source  of  outside  labour  for  reconstruction  in  Aceh.  Nias,  on  the \nother  hand,  never  had  a  serious  security  problem.  The  main  issue  affecting  the \nsupply  of  labour  there  was  the  ease  of  transportation  to  the  island  after  the \nreconstruction  begun.  It  appears  that  the  reconstruction  efforts  attracted  outside \nlabourers to take up work in Nias.  \n\nAt  first  glance,  a  large  increase  in  the  price  of  timber  is  surprising  given  that \nIndonesia,  and  Sumatra  in  particular,  is  well  endowed  with  forest  resources.  The \nBRR estimated that the housing reconstruction activities would need about 1.5 million \ncubic metres  of  timber.  Many  observers  estimated  that  this  amount  could  easily  be \nsupplied  from  normal  domestic  timber  production  supplemented  by  drawing  on \nseized  illegal  timber  stocks  held  by  the  Indonesian  Government  as  well  as  small \namounts of imported timber and supplies provided by donor countries. However, it is \nnow  thought  that  the  significant  increases  in  timber  prices  are  probably  related  to \ndifficulties in accessing the stocks of seized illegal timbers and in using imported and \ndonated  timbers. To explain further, from the  outset there  was a consensus among \nthe  BRR,  donors,  and  NGOs  that  reconstruction  activities  in  Aceh  and  Nias  would \nonly use legal timber, and where possible would only use timber available locally or \nfrom  elsewhere  in  Indonesia  (Jawa  Post,  27  December  2006).  This  attitude \nintroduced legal and administrative bottlenecks that restricted the supply of timber in \nthe  short-run.  Moreover,  the  legal  status  of  the  stocks  of  seized  illegal  timbers \nneeded to be clarified before the timber could be released use for in Aceh. Similarly, \ncriteria establishing the  amount of timber that could be imported and the guidelines \nfor  the  use  of  timber  provided  by  donor  countries  needed  to  be  established. \nReflecting  general  concerns  about  these  issues,  there  has  been  a  call  for  serious \nefforts from the Government to legalise the use of illegal timbers so that they could \nbe  utilised  immediately.  The  matter  was  not  as  straight-forward  as  it  might  seem \nsince there were valid concerns that the legalisation of illegal timber might encourage \nfurther illegal logging because of the possibility of legalising this product. \n\nIt may seem surprising that the supply of other building material inputs has not been \nmore elastic. Construction activities in other parts of the country since the crisis have \nbeen  relatively  sluggish  compared  to  the  situation  before  the  1997  crisis  and  it  is \nlikely  that  there  was  excess  capacity  in  other  regions.  But  even  if  inputs  for  house \nreconstruction can be accessed relatively easily elsewhere in Indonesia, it takes time \nto physically move materials and for labourers to arrive. There are therefore practical \nconstraints on the rate at which housing can be supplied. Realistically, the upper limit \nof housing construction achievable may be significantly lower than the original BRR \ntarget of 90,000\u2013100,000 houses by the end of 2006.  \n\n6.3. Livelihoods \n\nEfforts to rehabilitate livelihoods involved several activities. First, steps were taken to \nrestore  the  agriculture  and  fishery  sectors  through  revitalising  agricultural  and \nplantation \nfishing  boats.  Second, \nmicrofinance,  other  forms  of  cheap  credit,  and  assistance  were  made  available  for \nsmall  and  medium  enterprises.  Third,  employment  programs  such  as  cash-for-work \nand training programs were developed (BRR and International Partners, 2005). \n\nland,  rebuilding  ports,  and  replacing \n\nlost \n\nBy  December  2006  the  BRR  reported  that  approximately  50,000  hectares  of \nagricultural land had been restored (around 70 per cent of the total area damaged). \nIn  the  fishery  sector  about  4,400  boats  had  been  replaced  and  around  6,800 \n\n18 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\nhectares of fish ponds had been repaired (approximately 30 per cent of the total area \nof fish ponds damaged) (Table 6).  \n\nThe  information  available  on  how  many  activities  need  to  be  rehabilitated  and \ncreated, however, is not very clear. Table 4 indicates that more than 260,000 people \nin  Aceh  and  85,000  in  Nias  lost  their  sources  of  income.  But  it  is  also  important  to \nnote that unemployment and poverty were serious problems in Aceh and Nias before \nthe disasters. \n\nSPAN  2005  data  indicates  that  in  September  2005  around  46  per  cent  of  the \npopulation  in  Aceh  above  the  age  of  ten  (around  63  per  cent  of  the  population  in \nNias) were engaged in some form of employment while around 10 per cent in Aceh \n(6 per cent in Nias) were unemployed (Table 10). Of those who  worked, around 49 \nper  cent  in  Aceh  (56  per  cent  in  Nias)  were  self-employed  (Table  11),  which  is \ncommon in the informal sectors. Approximately 14 per cent  in Aceh (24 per cent in \nNias)  of  those  who  were  working  were  unpaid  workers, most  likely  family members \ninvolved  in  family  businesses.  Around  15  per  cent  in  Aceh  (7  per  cent  in  Nias)  of \nthat \nIDPs  and  ex-IDPs  were  unable \nreconstruction  activities  in  the  early  post-disaster  period  were  not  able  to  generate \nemployment for significant numbers.  \n\nfind  any  employment,  suggesting \n\nto \n\nOverall, around 300,000 jobs in Aceh and around 30,000 in Nias need to be created, \ncertainly  a  challenging  task.  By  April  2006,  the  BRR  reported  that  around  148,000 \npeople had received some skill training to enable them to re-enter the job market and \nthat  more  than  41,000  farmers  had  been  assisted  to  return  to  their  fields  (BRR, \n2006). By December 2006, the BRR claimed that around 69 per cent of the male and \n36 per cent of the female labour force in urban areas as well as around 68 per cent of \nthe male and 45 per cent of the female labour force in rural areas of both Aceh and \nNias  were  actively  engaged  in  some  form  of  work  (BRR  and  Partners,  2006). \nNevertheless, reliable data on how many of the people who were unemployed in mid-\n2005 actually obtained some form of employment is not available. \n\n6.4. School and Health Services \n\nTable 6 indicates that in the aftermath of the disasters around 2,000 school buildings \nneeded  to  be  rebuilt  and  approximately  2,500  teaching  positions  needed  to  be \nrefilled.  It  should  be  noted  that  there  was  a  serious  shortage  of  teachers  in  Aceh \neven  before  the  tsunami.  By  December  2006,  the  BRR  reported  that  around  750 \nschool buildings had been built and approximately 5,400 teaching positions had been \nfilled.  In  other  words,  in  terms  of  school  buildings,  only  around  40  per  cent  of  the \ntarget  had  been  reached  but  the  number  of  teachers  now  exceeded  pre-tsunami \nlevels, thus partially alleviating the teacher shortage (BRR and Partners, 2006).  \n\nIn rebuilding the education system in Aceh and Nias, besides taking into account the \ndamage caused by the disasters it is important to understand local needs. Table 12 \nshows the numbers of children and young adults who have never been to school and \nthose who have dropped out. Around 23,000 young persons aged 7 to 24 years old \nin  Aceh  and  around  31,000  in  Nias  have  never  been  to  school.  Table  13, \nfurthermore,  shows  that  among  those  who  have  dropped  out  of  school,  around \n50,000 in Aceh and 30,000 in Nias did not obtain any elementary education degree. \nThus, considering the low elementary school attainments and the low attainments at \nhigher  educational  levels,  even  if  the  elementary  schools  and  teacher  numbers  are \nrestored to pre-disaster levels they will still fall well below those needed to rebuild a \nbetter Aceh and Nias.  \n\n19 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\nIn the health sector, by December 2006 324 hospitals and health centres had been \nrebuilt. This far exceeds the number of hospitals and health services damaged by the \nearthquakes and tsunami. It should be said that health facilities before the disasters \nwere  in  a  state  of  neglect  and  the  need  for  health  facilities  has  substantially \nincreased in the aftermath. Approximately 63,000 people in Aceh and Nias suffered \nsome mental problems following the disasters and although reconstruction activities \nare underway, the risk of communicable disease outbreaks remains high. Looking at \nhousehold  sources  of  drinking  water  and  sanitation  facilities  (Tables  14  and  15),  it \ncan be seen that access to piped water in Aceh and Nias has been very limited and \nrelatively few households have septic tanks.10 Moreover, many people are still living \nin  shelters.  With  the  majority  of  people  in  Aceh  depending  mainly  on  wells  for \ndrinking water, it is important to monitor the water quality of these wells.  \n\n6.5. Infrastructure \n\nTowards the end of 2005 USAID signed an MOU with the Ministry of Public Works to \nreconstruct  240  kilometres  of  road  from  Banda  Aceh  to  Meulaboh.  Phase  1  of  the \nproject  (80  km\u2014connecting  Banda  Aceh  to  Lamno)  was  expected  to  be  completed \nby August 2006. Phase 2 of the project, the remaining 160 kilometres, was expected \nto take another two or  more years. Meanwhile, the Japan International  Cooperation \nAgency  agreed  to  rehabilitate  the  existing  122-kilometre  road  from  Calang  to \nMeulaboh (BRR and Partners, 2006).  \n\nMoreover,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  has  agreed  to  finance  the  rehabilitation  of \nanother  main  route,  a  490-kilometre  road  connecting  Banda  Aceh  with  North \nSumatra.  Overall  the  total  road  length  needing  to  be  rehabilitated  or  built  in  Aceh \nfollowing  the  disaster  was  around  3,000  kilometres  (Table  6).  Nias,  naturally,  does \nnot need as many roads as Aceh (BRR and International Partners, 2005). \n\nBesides  roads,  the  BRR  also  indicated  that  14  seaports,  11  airports  and  air  strips, \n120  arterial  bridges,  and  around  1,500  minor  bridges  need  to  be  rebuilt  (Table  6). \nCompared  with  progress  in  other  sectors,  infrastructure  reconstruction  has  been \nrelatively slow. The BRR reported that around 1,200 kilometres of roads in Aceh and \n300 kilometres in Nias had been built or repaired as at December 2006. Further, 14 \nferry  terminals  and  harbours,  8  airports  and  airstrips,  and  158  bridges  had  been \nrestored (BRR and Partners, 2006). The types of problems causing slow progress in \nthis area can be illustrated by an example. The construction of the road from Banda \nAceh to Meulaboh is experiencing serious delays. Issues concerning land acquisition \nand poor weather have been mentioned as the main reasons for the delay (USAID, \n2006). As far as land acquisition is concerned, significant differences have emerged \nbetween  the  kind  of  road  that  local  people  want  and  what  USAID  wants  to  build. \nUSAID  plans  to  build  a  highway  with  seven-metre  carriageways  and  two-metre \nshoulders.  Locals,  however,  not  only  fear  speeding  traffic  but  would  also  like  to  be \nable  to  sell  snacks  and tea  from stalls  along  the  roadside  (The New  York  Times,  9 \nOctober  2006).  The  dilemma  is  an  interesting  one.  While,  as  noted  earlier,  the \nIndonesian  Government  has  been  willing  to  set  aside  the  Master  Plan  and  follow  a \nmore bottom-up approach by taking into account local voices, some donors seem to \nbe committed to a top-down approach. \n\n                                                 \n10 In Aceh only around 30 per cent of households have toilets with septic tanks. In Nias the \npercentage is even lower; i.e., around 6 per cent. Thus a large proportion of households \nutilise toilets without septic tanks or use a pond or river as their toilet.   \n\n20 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\n7. CHALLENGES \n\nThere  are  four  main  challenges  that  the  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  process \nnow  faces.  The  first  arises  from  the  unrealistically  high  community  expectations \ngenerated by the various statements and pledges from government leaders, NGOs, \ndonors,  and  others.  Local  communities  now  expect  not  only  to  have  their  houses \nrebuilt and their livelihoods restored but also to participate in reconstruction activities. \nIt  is  hoped  that  expectations  can  be  managed  by  focusing  on  reasonable  targets \nalthough the BRR\u2019s operational approach does not yet provide for this.  \n\nthe  BRR  needs \n\nThe BRR\u2019s budget realisation for the 2005 and 2006 fiscal years is quite low. This is \nthe second challenge faced in the reconstruction process. We discuss this further in \nsection 7.2. The third challenge relates to issues of coordination and commitment. As \nto  establish  smooth  coordination \na  coordinating  agency, \narrangements with local governments and donor agencies. The relationship with local \ngovernments  is  pivotal  to  spending  monies  effectively  while  the  relationship  with \ndonor  agencies  is  vital  to  ensure  that  aid  commitments are  implemented  efficiently. \nFinally, there is the challenge of establishing a viable exit strategy for the BRR. The \ncurrent mandate of the BRR extends until 2009. By then it is expected that the BRR \nwill  have  arranged  the  transfer  of  the  whole  redevelopment  process  to  local \ngovernments.  There  is,  therefore,  a  challenge  for  both  the  BRR  and  local \ngovernments in handling the transition processes well.  \n\nThe following sections elaborate on these four challenges.  \n\n7.1. Managing Expectations \n\nThe  ambitious  plans  for  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  in  Aceh  and  Nias  have \ncreated  high  expectations.  During  the  initial  emergency  stage,  local  inhabitants \nwitnessed  the  arrival  of  large-scale  support  from  both  the  government  and  non-\ngovernmental  organisations  alike.  Figure  4  indicates  a  peak  of  activity  in  the  early \nstage which was much more intensive than the more sustained work carried out later \nin  the  recovery  stage.  But  as  the  diagram  shows,  there  is  a  risk  of  a  lull  in  activity \nwhen  the  emergency  stage  scales  back  to  a  lower  intensity  because  there  is  no \nguarantee  that  the  housing  recovery stage  will  kick in  quickly. A  lull  of  this kind  did \noccur and was seen by many people as reflecting inactivity on the part of the BRR. A \n\u201cslow  start\u201d,  which  is  the  term  some  observers  used  in  referring  to  the  first  year  of \nBRR  operations,  is  a  polite  judgement  compared  to  the  views  expressed  by  others \nwho cynically translated BRR as baru rapat-rapat (just hold meetings). \n\nFor  the  Acehnese  in  general  and  the  people  of  Nias  in  particular,  the  disasters \naroused expectations of significant improvements at the local level. Development in \nthese areas has long lagged behind development elsewhere in Indonesia. People in \nthese regions feel marginalised and isolated from the national development process, \neconomically  as  well  as  politically\u2014in  Aceh  because  of  the  long  socio-political \nconflict, and in Nias because of the separation from Sumatra and the remoteness of \nthe island.  \n\nThe  establishment  of  the  BRR  in  2005  led  to  considerable  excitement  among  the \nlocal  populace  in  Nias.  Many  people  imagined  that  they  would  take  part  in  the \nreconstruction  process  following  the  plans  set  out  by  the  agency.  Who  would  the \nBRR recruit if not locals who know the region well? It has to be acknowledged that in \nIndonesia  the  sentiment  of  putera  daerah  (local  people)  is  still  important  in  isolated \nareas. Local people were therefore very disappointed to find that their involvement in \nthe administration of the BRR in Nias was quite limited.  \n\n21 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\nIn the case of Nias, the irony is that for non-locals, an assignment to Nias is generally \nregarded  as  a  punishment  rather  than  a  promotion.  In  the  first  six  months  of  the \noperation of the BRR branch in Nias, only one out of twelve heads of BRR working \nunits lived on the island. This problem was remedied in early 2006 when the heads of \nBRR working units were instructed to live in Nias.  \n\nLocal  businesses  and  contractors  in  Aceh  and  Nias  were  also  excited  by  the \nprospect  of  involvement  in  BRR  projects.  Most  local  contractors,  however,  were \ndisappointed to find that in practice they were unable to participate in the construction \nprojects.  The  reason  for  this,  they  reported,  was  that  the  procurement  procedures \nand  requirements  set  down  by  the  BRR  for  redevelopment  construction  were  so \ncomplicated that local contractors were effectively excluded from participating.  \n\nFinally, the BRR\u2019s target of building around 92,000 houses in Aceh and Nias during \n2006\u2014which, added to those built in 2005, amounted to a target of around 108,000 \nhouses in total by the end of 2006\u2014raised special expectations. Although restoration \nof  the  housing  stock  was  justifiably  seen  as  the  main  priority,  the  feasibility  of  this \ntarget was questionable from the start, even allowing for the fact that the size of the \nnew homes was expected to be small (only 36 square metres). Typically, the number \nof new homes constructed nationwide in Indonesia is only around 60,000 per annum. \nIn  the  absence  of  any  decline  in  house  construction  elsewhere,  the  BRR  target \nimplied  an  increase  of  roughly  150  per  cent  in  the  output  of  the  national  housing \nconstruction industry, a very ambitious target.  \n\nEven  with  the  relatively  modest  rate  of  construction  achieved  in  2005  in  Aceh  and \nNias, wages in the construction industry and the price of building materials increased \nduring the year at levels higher than elsewhere in Indonesia (BRR and International \nPartners,  2005).  Adhering  closely  to  such  an  ambitious  target  thus  ran  the  risk  of \nencouraging the lowering of construction standards, and this implied that the much-\npublicised  opportunity  to  \u201cbuild  back  better\u201d  would  be  missed.  Moreover,  the  heavy \nadditional  demand  for  timber,  if  not  carefully  managed,  threatened  to  hasten \ndeforestation in Aceh and other parts of Indonesia.11  \n\nNevertheless,  BRR  officials  declared  themselves  confident  of  meeting  the  housing \ntargets and mentioned the following considerations in support of their optimism. First, \nafter  a  delay  of  some  months  in  its  establishment,  the  agency  had  generally  been \nable to demonstrate leadership in the reconstruction effort and hence had been able \nto  encourage major  participants  to  focus  their  efforts  on  housing.  Second,  the  BRR \nhas  been  allowed\u2014at  least  up  until  the  time  of  writing\u2014to  modify  the  Master  Plan \nstipulations  where  appropriate  after  consultations  with  local  communities.  This \npragmatic  approach  has  worked  to  overcome  a  number  of  conflicts  between  the \nperceived  interests  of  local  communities  and  the  constraints  of  the  Master  Plan  on \nhousing  programs.  Third,  most  problems  of  land  identification  had  been  solved \nthrough  the  Reconstruction  of  Aceh  Land  Administration  System  (RALAS)  project. \nFourth, the central government and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) agreed to end \ntheir thirty years of conflict on 15 August 2005. The result was that the general level \nof safety in Aceh improved greatly allowing reconstruction activities to be conducted \nin a conducive environment. Fifth, the BRR\u2019s special new authority, which allowed for \nthe  implementation  of  housing  projects  through  direct  contracting,  helped  to \noffset  delays  in  other  government  agencies  responsible  for  building  houses, \nsuch as the Ministry of Public Works. Finally, funds for reconstruction activities \n                                                 \n11 This issue has caused considerable controversy. Some local environmental groups have \nargued that reconstruction activities in Aceh have contributed to faster deforestation. See \nSijabat (2007). \n\n22 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\nbegan  to  flow  smoothly  (Kuncoro  and  Resosudarmo,  2006).  In  spite  of  this \noptimism  by  the  BRR,  however,  it  should  be  noted  that,  judging  by  the  number  of \nhouses built by November 2006, it seems highly unlikely that the housing target will \nbe  achieved.  Delays  in  reaching  targets,  in  turn,  may  weaken  the  credibility  of  the \nBRR as a reliable reconstruction partner in the region.  \n\nThere  is  a  quite  widespread  view  that  the  BRR  should  put  more  emphasis  on  the \nquality of reconstruction\u2014that is, maintaining house construction as its main priority \nbut  without  committing  itself  to  ambitious  numerical  targets\u2014while  meanwhile \nensuring that all those waiting to receive new housing are properly accommodated in \ntemporary  comfortable  living  conditions.  Arguably,  there  should  also  be  stronger \nemphasis  on  supporting  the  restoration  of  livelihood  activities  through  provision  of \nsuitable fishing boats, support for farming activities (such as the provision of seeds), \nrepair of the relevant infrastructure, and so on (Kuncoro and Resosudarmo, 2006).  \n\n7.2. BRR Spending \n\nAs at September 2006, spending by the BRR has lagged well behind budget (Table \n16).  Underexpenditure  of  this  kind  can  lead  to  widespread  dissatisfaction  among \nlocal people. The inability of the BRR to achieve its reconstruction target is reflected \nin  the  planned  budget  for  BRR  operations.  Indeed,  for  the  2005  budget,  the  BRR\u2019s \nfiscal  year  was extended up  to 2006. Thus, during January\u2013September 2006,  there \nwere two fiscal budgets running.  \n\nHowever,  even  after  the  extension  of  the  fiscal  year,  the  level  of  budget  spending \nwas  still  very  low.  Out  of Rp4  trillion  (around  US$410 million)  allocated  in  the  2005 \nbudget  for  the  BRR,  only  63  per  cent  was  spent.  Moreover,  the  higher  spending \nareas  appear  to  have  been  on  administrative  activities  related  to  offices,  planning, \nand programming.  \n\nThere was a sharp increase in the BRR budget for 2006.12 The main reason for this \nwas that, beginning in 2006, the BRR received an additional mandate to implement \nhousing  construction  in  an  effort  to  speed  up  activity  in  this  sector  following  the \nearlier disappointing performance. The agency was provided with additional funding \nof Rp4 trillion (around US$430 million) to build up to 40,000 houses during the year. \nMainly because of this initiative, the budgeted expenditure for the BRR in 2006 was \nset at around Rp10 trillion (around US$1 billion), an increase of over 150 per cent on \nits budget for 2005. It is not clear, however, that this approach will be successful. As \na new agency lacking experience in managing large-scale construction projects, it is \nuncertain  whether  the  BRR  will  able  to  implement  this  daunting  new  task  more \nsuccessfully  than  the  other  organisations  involved.  Moreover,  this  major  additional \nspending program is likely to further constrain the capacity of the BRR to coordinate \nother reconstruction programs. And if it turns out that the BRR does not perform well, \nthis  is  likely  to  further  lessen  its  moral  authority  to  oversee  the  programs  of  other \ninstitutions. Perhaps of greatest concern is whether, having such a large budget, the \nBRR  can  avoid  the  taint  of  mismanagement.  There  is  bound  to  be  considerable \npressure  on  its  officials  to  engage  in  corrupt  behaviour.  If  they  succumb  to  this \npressure,  the  ability  of  the  BRR  to  continue  to  lead  the  reconstruction  effort  will \nquickly diminish.  \n\nData  up  to  30  September  2006  suggest  that  expenditure  outcomes  throughout  the \nfinancial year remained well behind target (Table 16). While a slow start in 2005 was \n                                                 \n12 Table 16 shows the old format of BRR\u2019s budget, while Table 17 presents the new format \nand an additional budget of around Rp1 trillion in 2006. \n\n23 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\nperhaps  understandable,  the  continued  underspending  must  raise  concerns  about \nthe ability of the BRR to deliver on the promises that have been made. Nine months \ninto 2006 only about 18 per cent of the budget had been spent. The challenge for the \nBRR in the remaining months therefore was important. \n\nWhat  can  be  said  about  these  problems?  First,  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  local \npeople,  the  spending  delays  are  most  unfortunate.  In  2005  alone,  actual  spending \nreportedly  lagged  behind  planned  expenditures  by  about  Rp2.8  trillion  (around \nUS$290 million), the bulk of which reflected underspending in the areas of housing, \ninfrastructure, and land use coordination. One widely mentioned reason for spending \ndelays  was  said  to  be  the  BRR\u2019s  commitment  to  careful  management  of  project \nprocurement activities. This explanation, however, was not well-received at the local \nlevel.  What  the  locals  know  is  that  they  have  not  received  the  things  that  were \npromised to them by the BRR. People still living in barracks feel that they should by \nnow  have  been  able  to  move  into  permanent  housing,  and  fishermen  and  farmers \nfeel that their operations should, by this stage, have returned to normal. Second, this \ncontinuing underexpenditure naturally begs the question of whether the BRR will be \nable to execute planned budgets into the future.  \n\nWhat  are  the  policy  options?  First,  the  BRR  could  perhaps  have  tried  to  speed  up \nspending in the last three months of fiscal 2006. The danger is that quality would be \ncompromised  for  the  sake  of  quantity.  Worse,  the  emphasis  on  careful  project \nprocurement might be compromised. Alternatively,  the BRR could have  asked for a \ntechnical extension of the 2006 budget into the next year. However, the Indonesian \nGovernment would have been unlikely to agree to this because it would be reluctant \nto accept the idea that budget extensions were a normal way of doing business.  \n\nThe BRR seems to have preferred the first option. In the last three months of 2006, \nthe BRR spent around Rp8.8 trillion or almost 60 per cent of its total budget for 2006 \n(Table  17).  In  order  to  speed  up  spending  the  BRR  explored  the  idea  of \ndecentralising expenditure authority to local BRR offices across Aceh and Nias. For \nexample,  starting  in  April  2006  the  BRR  experimented  with  the  idea  of  placing  a \nliaison officer at the local level by creating joint secretariats with local governments in \nNias.  The  secretariats  were  given  a  wide  range  of  duties  including  coordinating \nactivities carried out by stakeholders, sharing information on the progress of recovery \nactivities,  involving  local  governments  in  the  recovery  process,  and  assisting  local \ngovernments  with  the  management  capacity  to  be  professional  lead  agencies  for \ndevelopment  activities.  Additional  liaison  officers  were  appointed  in  seven  or  more \nregional offices by the end of 2006.  \n\nThis  innovation  seems  to  have  helped  to  accelerate  the  housing  and  infrastructure \ndevelopment  program  in  that  more  decisions  will,  hopefully,  be  made  at  the  local \nlevel  under  this  approach.  The  current  plan  is  to  continue  to  decentralise  activities \nconsiderably during the next few years. In 2005 some 90 per cent of BRR staff were \nin Banda Aceh. However it is now expected that the proportion of staff in the central \nBanda Aceh office will go down to just 50 per cent by 2008. By gradually shifting the \ndecision-making and management to district and local town authorities across Aceh \nand  Nias,  it  is  expected  that  the  BRR\u2019s  role  will  be  reduced  mainly  to  monitoring, \ncountering corruption, problem solving, gap filling, and donor relations.  \n\nBut another option that perhaps should be considered\u2014which is also a very effective \nform  of  decentralisation\u2014is  the  establishment  of  a  much  larger  program  of  direct \ncash  transfers.  If  this  approach  were  adopted,  households  would  receive  cash  and \nbe able to organise building and rehabilitating their houses themselves. \n\n24 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\nThe donor community, too, has naturally been important in all of these activities. But \nunfortunately little public information is available regarding the expenditure programs \nof  donors.  There  are  no  comprehensive  reports  easily  available  on  how  much  the \ninternational donor community has spent so far. It would be particularly interesting to \nfind  out  how  much  has  been  spent  on  the  ground  in  Indonesia  and  how  much,  in \ntheir  own  administrative  activities.  More \ncontrast,  donors  have  spent  on \naccountability on the part of donors is clearly needed. \n\n7.3. Coordination and Commitments \n\nDeveloping  effective  coordination  within  the  BRR,  between  the  BRR  and  local \ngovernments,  as  well  as  between  the  BRR  and  other  organisations  has  been  a \ncontinuing challenge.  \n\nThe three key structures within the BRR itself are the Executive Agency, the Advisory \nBoard,  and  the  Supervisory  Board.  The  question  of  how  these  three  bodies  can \ninteract  efficiently  so  that  the  BRR  as  a  whole  can  be  effective  has  been  a  major \nissue ever since the BRR was established in early 2005.  \n\nSince  the  early  days  of  the  BRR,  the  Executive  Agency  has  shown  flexibility, \nchoosing  to  follow  the  Bappenas  Master  Plan  when  practical  but  being  ready  to \nmodify it when necessary. However the definition of \u201cpractical\u201d is not clear. There is \nno agreement on this matter between the Executive Agency, the Advisory Board, and \nthe  Supervisory  Board.  There  is  a  perception  that  the  Executive  Agency  can  do \nwhatever  it  wants,  even  though  the  Advisory  and  Supervisory  Boards  may  have \ndifferent views. Even within the Executive Agency itself there is no clear guidance on \nthis for staff. The result is a lack of consistency in operations. Some directors follow \nthe  stipulations  of  the  Master  Plan\u2014even  when  doing  so  is  problematic\u2014on  the \ngrounds that abandoning the Plan would be tantamount to ignoring the law because \nit is embodied in a presidential decree (Kuncoro and Resosudarmo, 2006). \n\nThus  there  is  now  a  growing  view  that  the  role  of  the  Supervisory  and  Advisory \nBoards  needs  to  be  strengthened.  There  are  also  some  calls  to  reevaluate  the \noriginal  Master  Plan  with  the  aim  of  removing  the  parts  that  create  problems, \nsimplifying  others,  and  strengthening  those  that  are  important\u2014particularly  those \nrelating to land use planning. It is hoped that a revised version of the Plan might then \nprovide guidance that would be followed by both the BRR and by all other institutions \ncontributing to the reconstruction effort (Kuncoro and Resosudarmo, 2006). \n\nBRR coordination with local governments has so far been rather weak. Initially, local \ngovernments  expected  that  the  BRR  would  help  them  implement  local  priorities. \nHowever,  seeing  that  local  governments  lacked  comprehensive  rehabilitation  plans, \nthe  BRR  devised  its  own  plan  and  spent  considerable  time  in  2005  establishing \noffices  and  learning  about  local  problems.  This  approach  did  not  work  very  well. \nLocal  governments  felt  that  they  already  had  sufficient  knowledge  about  local \nconcerns and were furious over what they regarded as a late start by the BRR. The \nweak coordination between the BRR and local governments should not be attributed \nto a lack of commitment. There were many meetings and discussions. However, the \ndifferent  organisations  just  did  not  relate  to  each  other  very  well.  As  noted  in  the \npublication  of  BRR  and  International  Partners  (2005):  \u201c\u2026most  meetings,  ostensibly \nfor  coordination,  achieved  little  more  than  information-sharing  rather  than  strategic \nplanning [and] ... agency leaders were so busy on their own programs that they were \nfrustrated  when  they  attended  a  meeting  that  wasn\u2019t  useful  ...  [so  that]  they  were \nlikely to send junior staff in future, so reinforcing the information rather than strategy \ncontent\u201d.  \n\n25 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\nThe  result  was  that  local  Bappeda  kabupaten  (district)  and  kota  (municipality) \nagencies did not align their 2006 regional budgets with the BRR\u2019s 2006 plan. Indeed, \nmany  regional  governments  complained  that  they  did  not  know  what  the  BRR \nplanned to do in their regions. \n\nThe  BRR  also  struggled  to  develop  relations  with  other  agencies  involved  in  the \nAceh-Nias  reconstruction  activities  although,  in  general,  the  BRR  was  able  to  take \nthe lead in management. The struggle was evident in several areas. First, there were \nsignificant  imbalances  within  the  various  components  of  the  rehabilitation  effort \nbetween  the  minimum  requirements  and  the  available  funds.  Figure  5  shows  the \ndifference between total current commitments of funding by government and donors \nin each sector and the minimum funding requirements. It can be seen that funding far \nin  excess  of  actual  needs  has  been  allocated  to  areas  such  as  health,  culture  and \nreligion,  governance  and  administration,  enterprise  rehabilitation,  education,  and \nwater  and  sanitation,  while  energy  supply,  the  environment,  flood  control  and \nirrigation works, and transport are significantly under-funded. So far, the BRR has not \nbeen  able  to  persuade  donors  to  reallocate  funding  from  excessively  funded  to \nunder-funded sectors. Another example of the BRR\u2019s limited ability to coordinate the \nrecovery effort is that several of the NGOs involved have not been able to deliver the \noutcomes  they  have  promised,  particularly  in  relation  to  housing  construction  and \nprovision of income earning opportunities.  \n\nSecond, it is not apparent that the BRR has the ability to ensure that commitments by \ninternational  and  domestic  donors  will  materialise  in  a  timely  manner.  Some \ncommitments  may  not  translate  into  actual  fund  flows  for  various  reasons  beyond \nIndonesia\u2019s control. Indonesia\u2019s capacity to absorb domestic aid is also an important \nfactor.  It  is  vital  that  the  BRR  maintains  effective  communication  with  donors  and \nengages donors in developing activities so as to minimise any mismatches between \ndonors\u2019 interests and reconstruction priorities. \n\n7.4. Exit Strategy \n\nIt is important that reconstruction programs following a natural disaster should fit into \nbroader  programs  of  economic  development  for  the  affected  regions.  The  current \nplan  is for  the mandate  of  the  BRR  to  end  in  2009.  The  question  of  the BRR\u2019s  exit \nstrategy  therefore  becomes relevant. Figure  4  suggests  that  the  agency  might  start \nphasing out its activities by mid-2008. For housing, the target was to finish rebuilding \nby mid-2007. The dotted lines at the far right of Figure 4 suggest that the BRR will no \nlonger  execute  projects  itself,  but  will  leave  certain  activities  for  other  agencies. \nIndeed,  at  the  end  of  its  term,  the  expectation  is  that  the  BRR  will  hand  over  the \nresources it has been using to local governments (at both the provincial and district \nor  municipality  levels),  which  will  be  expected  to  continue  reconstruction  and \ndevelopment activities. \n\nSustainability, then, is an issue that needs to be considered. First is the sustainability \nof  the  development  process  initiated  by  the  BRR.  In  its  operations,  the  BRR  had \nintroduced procedures and practices that appear in some cases to be different from \nthe operational procedures currently in use by local governments. It is important that \nthe  BRR\u2019s  governance systems can  be  implemented  by  local  governments  while  at \nthe same time allowing for different local values and cultures. During the period to the \nend  of  2009  when  the  BRR  is  expected  to  cease  operations,  the  BRR  and  local \ngovernments  must  work  together  to  find  governance  systems  that,  given  the  local \ncontext  and  capability,  are  workable  and  acceptable  to  local  people.  Second,  the \nBRR currently also acts as a focal point for various budgetary matters including the \ncoordination of funds from donor agencies. In many instances the BRR matches local \n\n26 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\nneeds  with  possible  funding  from  both  national  and  international  donor  agencies. \nThis task requires understanding and sensitivity to local needs on the one hand, and \non  the  other  calls  for  effective  networking  and  good  diplomatic  skills  to  liaise  with \ndonors  and  upper  level  governments.  As  2009  approaches,  the  BRR  should \nincreasingly share its knowledge and information about financial networks with local \ngovernments.  \n\nThe issue of an exit strategy certainly emphasises the need for close communication \nbetween the BRR and local governments across Aceh and Nias.  \n\n8. CONCLUSION \n\nThis paper has discussed recent progress in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of \nAceh and Nias following the greatest natural disaster in recorded Indonesian history. \nOn  the  economic  front,  the  December  2004  earthquakes  and  tsunami  severely \naffected  the  livelihood  of  hundreds  and  thousands  of  people  in  the  region. \nFurthermore,  despite  large-scale  reconstruction  activities  in  the  aftermath  of  the \ndisaster, many people have still been unable to find jobs. Moreover, the region was \nalso  affected by relatively  high inflation partly caused by  the reconstruction process \nitself. \n\nNotably,  the  various  stakeholders  in  the  reconstruction  process  have  been  virtually \nunanimous  in  claiming  that  progress  has  been  too  slow.  Many  reconstruction  plan \ntargets have not yet been met and it appears likely that achievements will tend to fall \nshort  of  targets  in  the  foreseeable  future.  Budget  expenditures  have  fallen  well \nbehind  targets  as  well,  even  though  a  four-month  extension  of  the  2005  fiscal  year \nwas agreed to with  the  aim of providing leeway  in implementing activities.  Late and \nnon-realisation  of  the  2006  budget  are  no  less  worrying\u2014a  mere  18  per  cent  of \nspending had taken place up to the end of September 2006.  \n\nSeveral observations may be made about this slow progress. Effective coordination \namong agencies, both domestic and foreign, is essential. The BRR as a coordinating \nagency needs to operate in close collaboration with local people, local governments, \nand  donor  agencies. \ninadequate  consultation  and  coordination, \nreconstruction  programs  will  be  delayed,  parties  will  lack  a  sense  of  ownership \ntowards  the  various  activities,  and  the  risk  that  different  agencies  will  operate  at \ncross-purposes will increase. A second issue relates to the overall financing needs of \nreconstruction.  In  the  longer-term,  unanticipated  and  large  cost  increases  in \nreconstruction activities can be expected to produce a funding gap that must be met \none way or another if reconstruction work is to be completed.  \n\nthere \n\nis \n\nIf \n\nIn  one  respect  at  least,  the  awful  natural  disasters  brought  some  benefits  to  the \nconflict-ridden region of Aceh. Three decades of political and military conflict before \nthe  tsunami  had  caused  widespread  suffering  in  the  province.  Peace  talks  had \ncommenced  before  the  tsunami  but  progress  had  been  slow.  The  natural  calamity \nput sharply renewed pressure on the parties to the peace negotiations to reach early \nagreements  on  key  issues so  that  reconstruction  activities  could  proceed  smoothly. \nIn  short,  suddenly  the  great  majority  of  people  in  the  region  were  united  in  their \ndemand that there be peace. \n\nOne nagging question remains: How can Indonesia best prepare to cope with natural \ndisasters in the future? It seems clear that in a developing country such as Indonesia, \ndisaster management should start with local society, at the local level. In this context \nthere  are  two  main  lessons  to  learn.  First,  it  is  important  to  improve  local  early \nwarning systems across the nation and to increase awareness of the local indications \n\n27 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\nthe  great \n\nimportance  of  disseminating  such \n\nthat a natural disaster might be about to occur. Indeed, as we have discussed, local \nknowledge  of  some  of  these  indications  currently  exists  among  some  traditional \ncommunity  groups  in  Indonesia.  As  a  country  prone  to  natural  disasters,  Indonesia \nshould  acknowledge \ntraditional \nknowledge  throughout  the  country  by,  for  example,  including  the  topic  of  natural \ndisasters  in  the  national  curriculum  beginning  at  the  elementary  school  level \n(Kompas,  12  October  2006).  Second,  it  is  important  to  note  that  community  self \nreliance  is  vital  in  a  society  facing  severe  natural  disasters,  especially  during  the \ncritical first hours following a disaster. It is inevitable that outside help will take time to \narrive, especially in remote areas. Indeed, by the time that news of the disaster has \nbeen reported on the national, and especially the international media, it is often that \ncase  that  many  of  the  injured  have  already  died.  And,  of  course,  international \nagencies  also  need  to  improve  their  ability  to  respond much faster  and  much more \nefficiently to disasters in developing countries. \n\nAs  a  last  observation,  it  should  be  emphasised  that  reconstruction  after  a  natural \ndisaster  poses  numerous  difficult  challenges.  Close  coordination  between  all  of  the \nagents  involved  is  essential,  as  is  a  peaceful  socio-political  environment  and  active \ncommunity involvement in program implementation. Further, it is important that there \nare no false promises  of assistance so that local people have realistic expectations \nabout  the  speed  of  reconstruction  work.  Targets should  be  realistic,  significant  cost \nincreases  must  be  expected  and  budgeted  for,  and  plans  should  reflect  a  sensible \napproach  to  the  sequencing  of  programs.  In  particular,  from  the  very  beginning, \nrebuilding  economic  livelihoods  and  housing  reconstruction  should  be  seen  as  top \npriorities. Strategies must be developed to ensure that there is efficient coordination \namong  different  agencies,  that  commitments  of  assistance  from  both  domestic  and \ninternational organisations are fulfilled, and  that  those agencies are accountable for \nthe  promises  that  they  have  made.  Finally,  reconstruction  agencies  should  set  out \nclear exit strategies to allow for a smooth transfer of activities into the hands of local \ngovernments and organisations at the end of the reconstruction period.  \n\n28 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 70 \n\n \n\nNazara and Resosudarmo \n\nReferences \n\n \nADB  (Asian  Development  Bank)  (2006).  \u201cProgress  Report  Indonesia:  Aceh-Nias \n\nRehabilitation and Reconstruction\u201d.

This  was  followed  soon  after  by  a  major  earthquake  in  the \nneighbouring island of Nias. A large reconstruction programme was launched by the \ngovernment,  with  pledges \nthe \nreconstruction costs. The changed approach in Aceh following the tsunami paved the \nway  for  a  peace  settlement  that  ended  a  decades-long  military  conflict  in  the \nprovince. However, two years after the tsunami key reconstruction plan targets have \nnot  been  met  and  are  unlikely  to  be  met  in  the  foreseeable  future.  The  Indonesian \nexperience  highlights  coordination  problems  between \nthe  many  government \nagencies, international donors, and  NGOs; difficulties for reconstruction agencies in \nusing funds effectively; and the dangers of a large funding gap emerging because of \nunderestimation  of  local  cost  increases.  Lessons  and  implications  are  drawn  for \ninstitutional development and policy formulation to cope with future natural disasters. \nThese  have  relevance  not  only  for  Indonesia  but  also  for  many  other  developing \ncountries.  \n \nJEL Classifications: Q54, F35, H54, I38, O19 \n \nSuggested citation: Nazara, Suahasil and Budy P.
