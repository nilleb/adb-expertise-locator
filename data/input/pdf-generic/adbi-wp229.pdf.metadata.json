INTRODUCTION \nThe costs of building and upgrading the Asia-Pacific region\u2019s infrastructure to meet the basic \nneeds  of  its  citizens  and  industries  and  raise  standards  and  quantity  levels  to  those \ncomparable to advanced countries are huge. During 2010\u20132020, it is estimated that Asia will \nneed  to  invest  approximately  US$8  trillion  in  overall  national  infrastructure  for  energy, \ntransport, telecommunications, water, and sanitation. In addition, the region will need to \nspend approximately US$300 billion on regional pipeline infrastructure projects2 in transport, \nenergy, and telecommunications. This amounts to an overall infrastructure investment need \nof about US$750 billion per year during this 11-year period (for details see ADB/ADBI 2009 \nand  Bhattacharyay  2010).  Financially,  the  demand  for  cross-border  and  regional \ninfrastructure  funding  will  often  directly  compete  with  funding  for  improved  national \ninfrastructure3, which will be primarily financed by the home country (national and local) \nauthorities. These financial requirements are huge and the result is a very large financing \ngap, or the difference between total financial requirements and the likely available financing \nthrough direct public resources. However, it simultaneously offers considerable benefits and \nvast investment opportunities for the large savings and international reserves in Asia and the \nPacific (hereafter referred to simply as Asia).  \nAsia has an abundance of resources that can be utilized to meet these financing needs. \nTable 1 shows how the total annual savings of the eleven Asian economies were a massive \nUS$4  trillion  in  2007  and  US$3.6  trillion  in  2006.  Moreover,  the  stock  of  total  official \ninternational reserves reached US$3.7 trillion in 2007 (US$3.1 trillion in 2006). This huge \npool of Asian savings is sufficient to finance Asia\u2019s infrastructure development if means can \nbe found to direct it to that purpose. \n                                                 \n2 Regional infrastructure projects are defined as: (i) projects that involve physical construction works and/or \ncoordinated policies and procedures spanning two or more countries; and (ii) national infrastructure projects \nthat have a significant cross-border impact including: (1) their planning and implementation involve cooperation \nor coordination with one or more other countries, (2) they aim to stimulate significant amounts of regional trade \nand income; and (3) they are designed to connect to the network of a neighboring or third country (ADB/ADBI \n2009). \n3 For example, according to the Indian Planning Commission\u2019s Eleventh Five-Year Plan, India requires US$500 \nbillion to US$515 billion during the years up to fiscal year 2011/12 to upgrade its infrastructure and maintain \nrobust growth (Planning Commission 2008). \n1  ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \n  \nTable 1: Gross Domestic Products, Gross Domestic Savings, and Foreign Reserves of \nSelected Countries in Asia, 2006-2007 (in US$ billion) \nCountry/region  2006  2007 \nGDP  Saving  Reserv GDP  Saving  Reserv\nes  es \n  PRC  2,774  1,313  1,066  3,239  1,384  1,434 \n  Hong Kong, China  190  63  133  201  84  141 \n  Japan  4,366  1,247  875  4,403  1311  923 \n  Korea  888  282  238  958  311  257 \n  Taipei,China  356  88  266  372  116  280 \nEast Asia-5  8,574  2,992  2,579  9,173  3,207  3,034 \n  Indonesia  365  105  41  388  140  51 \n  Malaysia  156  63  82  175  85  98 \n  Philippines  118  22  20  140  47  30 \n  Singapore  132  67  136  150  88  152 \n  Thailand  206  72  65  237  97  79 \nASEAN-5  977  328  343  1091  457  409 \n  India  911  308  170  1085  329  267 \nAsia-11  10,461  3,628  3,093  11,349  3,992  3,710 \nExcluding Japan  6,095  2,381  2,218  6,946  3,992  3,710 \nNotes:  \nOfficial reserves at 2007 represent values as of the end of the third quarter. \nData on GDP, savings, and reserves for each economic region are the sum over the countries in the region.  \n2005~2006 data on gross domestic saving of Japan are imputed based on trend term, GDP, and second-order lag \nterms of saving itself.  \nSources: Asian Development Bank (ADB) - Key Indicators 2007; Asian Development Outlook (2008), ADB, Manila; \nInternational Financial Statistics (IFS) (2008), International Monetary Fund, Washington, D.C.; World Development \nIndicators CD-ROM (2007), World Bank, Washington, D.C. \nThere can be no single path to mobilizing sufficient funding for infrastructure in Asia. The \nfunding  requirements  are  too  large,  widespread,  and  diverse  and  will  require  multiple \nsources of funding. Different forms of financing will be appropriate for different types of \nprojects belonging to various sectors and social, legal, or institutional settings. Multilateral \ndevelopments banks, such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank, and \nbilateral development banks (BDBs) or agencies, like the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency (JICA) and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), can provide funds \nand facilitate co-financing. However, their ability is quite limited compared with the vast \nneeds. Public, private, and mixed funding\u2014such as public-private partnerships (PPP)\u2014will \nall be needed within and beyond Asia. \nWhy have Asian economies not been able to fill the financing gaps? Incentives must be \nfound to increase the total funding of infrastructure. It is equally important to direct funds to \nwhere they could be most beneficial, including finding methods for dispersing funds to \nsmaller or low income countries that might normally be missed.  \nThis  paper  will  review  various  options  for  financing  national  and  regional  infrastructure \ndevelopment in Asia to create a pan-Asian infrastructure network that supports basic human \nneeds,  enhances  regional  connectivity,  promotes  intraregional  trade  and  economic \ndevelopment, and provides public safety and welfare. Particularly, it will discuss the role of \nfinancial integration in financing infrastructure with the examination of experiences in Asia \nand other regions, such as the European Union (EU) and Latin America. This paper also \nfocuses on steps that could be taken to raise the needed funds based on the lessons \nlearned and prior experiences.  \n2 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 examines the role of financial \nmarket integration in mobilizing infrastructure funds. It also sets out general steps that can \nsupport the building of strong and effective integrated financial markets in Asia. Section 3 \nreviews the experiences in Asia and other parts of the world, particularly the European Union \n(EU).  Section  4  recommends  ways,  means,  and  specific  changes  to  institutions  and \nprograms  to  address  the  infrastructure  financing  gap.  This  includes  the  role  of  major \nfinancing institutions such as ADB, World Bank, and the Asian Bond Market Initiative (ABMI). \nThe last section concludes with final thoughts and recommendations.  \n2.  ROLE OF FINANCIAL INTEGRATION IN ASIA \nIn this paper, it is hypothesized that inefficient and segmented financial markets in Asia \nprevent effective intermediation between Asia\u2019s large savings and Asian investment needs. \nIn the absence of effective financial markets with significant penetration throughout the \nregion, Asian financial markets are mostly outwardly oriented. Massive savings from net \nexport surpluses flow out of Asia through a few Asian financial centers to global financial \ncenters, such as New York and London. This process is inefficient in addressing Asia\u2019s \ninvestment needs and creates a range of serious problems from capital flow management, \nnegative carrying costs, and poor investment signals, to difficulties in monetary policy and \nshallow and volatile markets, among others. It also unnecessarily embeds monetary and \nexchange policy decisions made in Washington, London, or Frankfurt into the savings-\ninvestment process in Asia. Efforts to build stronger and more relevant integrated financial \nmarkets in Asia can thus address such serious issues, and also facilitate the real economic \nadjustments needed to support Asia\u2019s development. \n2.1   Impediments to Intra-Asian Regional Investments \nWhy  are  Asian  financial  markets  and  private  sector  companies  failing  to  adequately \ncontribute to regional investments? Some of the answers can be found in several areas \nwhere there are impediments to effective cross-border flows of investment capital in Asia. \nOne major impediment is that, despite reforms, there is still a deficiency in appropriate legal, \nregulatory,  and  governance  frameworks  that  encourage  cross-border  investment  and \nmitigate political, legal and regulatory risks. Many potential investors may fear that cross-\nborder  investments  are  too  risky,  with  uncertain  prospects  to  recover  funds  or  resolve \ncommercial disputes in the absence of any dispute settlement mechanisms. Concerns about \npolitical uncertainties or discrimination against foreign investors might also impede capital \nflows. Development of commercial and legal codes and conflict resolution frameworks, such \nas those envisioned in the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN (ERIA) East Asian \nCommunity blueprint, can contribute greatly to mitigating these concerns and creating an \nenabling environment.4 Progress dealing with legal and governance impediments to cross-\nborder  investment  is  needed.5 Linking  Asian  capital  markets  such  as  stock  and  bond \nmarkets can facilitate cross-border investment. \nInhibiting the development of viable infrastructure projects are difficulties in design, cost \nestimation, and technical preparation of bankable cross-border, or regional6, infrastructure \nprojects. Difficulties also arise in gaining full understanding of all potential risks involved \n                                                 \n4 On 4 March 2008, a joint Institute for Development Economics/Japan External Trade Organization conference \n\u201cCreating the World\u2019s Largest Business Space\u201d unveiled plans for a unified economic space in Asia including \nall major South and East Asia countries. To support this initiative, the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN \nand East Asia (ERIA), located in ASEAN headquarters in Jakarta is preparing a blueprint for integration of \ntrade and infrastructure and supporting institutions and policies. Harmonization of commercial codes and \nadjudication of business disputes are key parts of the agenda.  \n5 For in-depth discussions of these issues, please refer to works by Alburo (2010) and Wang (2010). \n6 The terms \u201ccross-border\u201d and \u201cregional\u201d are used interchangeably in this paper.  \n3 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \n(such as political, socio-economic, operational, and financial), and the pricing those risks. \nCross-border projects are more complex in many dimensions and are often of larger scale \ncompared to national projects. A long, expensive, and technically demanding process is \nrequired to prepare infrastructure projects that will appeal to international investors and offer \nprofits.  Feasibility  studies  for  large  cross-border  projects  require  considerable  financial \noutlays  and  determining  the  criteria  for  sharing  these  expenses  among  participating \ncountries is challenging. Cross-border infrastructure projects are typically non-rival and/or \nnon-excludable  and  can  be  fronted  by  entrepreneurs,  or  governments,  with  possible \nassistance from International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and Multilateral Development Bank \n(MDBs)  such  as  ADB  or  the  World  Bank.  Difficulties  in  locating  funding  for  technical \npreparations, lack of expertise, lack of project implementation capacity, and the absence of a \nprioritized program for development are among the major impediments to effective cross-\nboarder project implementation. \nTraditional  infrastructure  financing\u2014government  financing  through  debt  or  bonds\u2014has \nsevere limitations. Most Asian debt is financed through bank loans, but these loans are \nlimited in tenor and expose projects to refinancing risks. The past reliance on government \nfunding of infrastructure has stunted the growth of private bond markets and financing, and \nonly now that demand for private participation exists,7 are the tools to support private funding \nbeing built. Funding can be facilitated by building effective capital markets, but often must \nalso be supplemented by public investment initiatives and guarantees to promote the desired \ntypes of infrastructure investment. This requires efficient and stable financial markets that \nprovide investment signals promoting the most productive use of capital for infrastructure.  \nMany of the reasons for the financial sector in Asia having failed to provide the needed \nsupport  for  infrastructure  finance  were  discussed  in  depth  in  the  2008  OECD-ADBI \nRoundtable on Capital Market Reform in Asia and some key conclusions taken from that \ndiscussion are summarized in Box 1. Overcoming financial sector impediments to encourage \nefficient  flows  of  private  capital,  in  conjunction  with  supportive  official  investment, \nguarantees, and concessional finance, is a necessary component for addressing regional \ninfrastructure investment needs and the financing gap. \n \n                                                 \n7 For instance, India\u2019s 11th Five Year Plan (2007\u20132012) has total investment requirements of US$494 billion, \nwith private contributions for infrastructure development at nearly 30%. India has adopted an open model that \nencourages foreign investment. India permits 100% foreign direct investments in most sectors and this has \nresulted in large private flows primarily through private equity placements. However, bond market financing \nremains very limited, and promoting bond market development is on the public agenda (Radhakrishnan 2008). \n4 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \nBox 1: The State of Asian Financial Markets - Conclusions from the 2008 OECD-\nADBI Roundtable on Capital Market Reform in Asia \nAsian  financial  markets  are  dominated  by  banks,  many  of  which  are  integrated  with \ninternational interbank markets, allowing the banks to serve as intermediaries between Asian \nsources of capital (generated by high local savings and high export earnings) and global \ninterbank markets, which absorb these funds. Capital from international markets comes back \nto Asia through banks, but also through equity markets and foreign direct investment. This \nout-and-in  pattern  has  very  successfully  supported  export  expansion  and  private  sector \nconstruction in many Asian countries. Moreover, until quite recently, it contributed to very \nlarge  accumulations  of  official  reserve  assets,  as  authorities  accumulated  reserves  and \nsuccessfully kept prices under control through sterilization. Also, the condition of banking \nsystems steadily improved and banks have built strong capital bases, improved efficiency and \nprofitability, and reduced nonperforming loans.  \nThis system, however, tended to slow the development of deep capital markets that permit \nlocal lenders and borrowers to lend and borrow across the range of maturities at rates \nreflecting local supply and demand conditions. Banks often failed to serve large communities \nwithin their countries, which left potential market niches for innovative institutions or capital-\nmarket instruments. Also contributing to the weak impetus to develop capital markets were \nrestrictions on cross border investments, lack of institutional underpinnings, lack of legal \nharmonization between countries, exchange rate risks, and lack of market depth and volume, \nwhich resulted in more volatility and higher costs. The investor base remained small, with \ninstitutional investors largely missing. Market and prudential information and disclosures were \nweak. Markets remained largely isolated from each other.  \nThe pattern above is gradually changing, with a deepening of markets and incremental growth \nof equity and bond markets. In particular, there has been significant progress in developing \nlocal currency bond markets. Also, securitization is being introduced as a way of channeling \ninvestments into new areas. The improvements are in part due to progress in revamping \nregulations, oversight, and institutions that have improved market conditions. Capital markets \nare deeper, more inclusive, and more open; Legal arrangements are improving; corporate \ngovernance is better; the regulatory and supervisory frameworks are stronger; and countries \nhave adopted international standards and best practices.  \nSource: Author \nHigh capital intensity of cross-border projects implies a high debt service ratio, long pay-off \nperiods, and uncertainty of the forecast traffic volumes or demand. This requires availability \nof  appropriate  and  innovative  financial  instruments  in  the  financial  markets.  Equity \ninvestment is an efficient method for sharing risk between public and private sectors for long \ntenure,  cross-border  projects.  However,  several  Asian  countries  do  not  allow  equity \ninvestment by foreign companies in certain infrastructure sectors. The private sector would \nthen have to bear a higher risk in the form of a debt position in order to participate in \ninfrastructure projects in these countries (van der Geest and Nunez-Ferrer 2010). \nImprovements are apparent, but the pace lags behind the potential and important current \nneeds remain unserved. Many countries in the region need to do more to enhance the \noperations and efficiency of their financial markets, but resources for facilitating these efforts \nare  often  limited.  Moreover,  the  culture  of  capital  market  investment  needs  to  be \nsubstantially  strengthened.  Overcoming  financial  sector  impediments  and  aspects  of \nfinancial packages are covered in greater detail later in this paper. \n5 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \n \n2.2  Regional Financial Integration \u2013 A Regional Approach to \nFinancing Infrastructure  \nThe  financing  of  cross-border  infrastructure  inherently  demands  a  regional  perspective, \nbecause projects that involve more than one country introduce risks that single country \nprojects do not face and the financing comes from different economies. It is useful to review \nthis situation from the perspective of an integrated Asian economy rather than as the sum of \nneeds of individual Asian countries. The regional approach must take into consideration \nexchange rates, inflation, and interest rates, as well as benefit and cost valuation issues over \ntime.  \nAssessing Asia-wide infrastructure costs and benefits on a consistent basis, uninfluenced by \nvarying  configurations  of  exchange  rates,  national  inflation  rates,  and  interest  rates,  is \nadvantageous, because funding costs and the discounting of project costs and services \nbenefits are affected.8 Premiums for exchange rate risk and country risk will affect the cost of \nborrowing for infrastructure. Differences in inflation performance between countries also \naffects the cost of infrastructure development, with countries that have a history of high \ninflation facing elevated borrowing costs as inflation premiums are built into borrowing rates. \nConsidering inter-temporal infrastructure costs is also important, because the structure of the \nindividual economies will change as infrastructure systems are developed and countries \nbecome increasingly integrated into the regional economy, and the valuation of infrastructure \ncosts and benefits will change as the infrastructure evolves. \nNew institutions and markets will be needed to tap savings within the region, to lure private \nand public foreign capital, and direct them to priority infrastructure projects throughout the \nregion.  The  most  efficient  application  of  capital  infrastructure  development  will  involve \nsignificant intra-Asia flows of capital because individual country programs may be at odds \nwith the optimal regional arrangement, given differences between countries in domestic \nsavings  and  infrastructure  needs,  and  likely  externalities  in  benefits  of  infrastructure \ndevelopment that are not captured on a national basis. The new regional institutions and \nmarkets could be structured in two ways: either effectively integrated across the region or \nconverged in practice through collaborative national efforts.  \nEach factor mentioned above suffers from the absence of efficient bond markets in Asia, \nwhich is a tool for tapping long-term capital for use in building infrastructure that usually \ninvolves long time frames. Long-term bond rates are affected by inflation and exchange rate \npremiums, which vary from country to country. Moreover, without convergence to efficient \ncommon  bond  pricing  between  economies,  their  respective  capital  markets  will  remain \nseparate, which hinders borrowing of large capital and the reallocation of capital to the most \nproductive infrastructure projects. Also, without a common bond rate, discounting the value \nof future benefits and costs is difficult.9  \n                                                 \n8 A unified method of valuing projects through the region should be considered. The International Comparison \nProject (ICP) has shown that national exchange rates can systematically diverge for extended periods from \nappropriate values based on purchasing power parity. Moreover, the specific configuration of exchange rates \ncan affect assessments in two ways: the costs of individual cross-border projects are affected by the exchange \nrates between countries, and the exchange rate of Asian currencies vis-\u00e0-vis the denominator currency \n(presumably the external currency used to fund most of the imported capital requirements for infrastructure \ndevelopment) also affects calculations. Moreover, changes in exchange rates over time, perhaps resulting from \nendogenous economic changes created by the new infrastructure, affect overall valuations. \n9 The segmentation of a financial market is likely to result in non-convergence in pricing between two markets for \nsimilar or identical products. This imperfection in the \u201claw of one price\u201d has been observed even for identical \nequities selling in two economies, even if such non-convergence is very small. This is relevant for the \ninfrastructure project in two ways; a security to fund infrastructure in a common currency unit or basket might \nhave somewhat different values between countries based on differing liquidity and trading practices, and \n6 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \nBased on these considerations, the question arises whether a basket measure of currency \nrequirements for infrastructure investment should be constructed to provide a cross-country, \ntemporally consistent method of project valuation in different Asian countries.10 A basket \ncould be constructed according to size of the economies, regional purchasing power parity, \nor based on the costs of technical inputs for development of Asian infrastructure, among \nothers. This paper, therefore, will examine currency risk exposures of lenders and borrowers \nin  cross-border  infrastructure  projects  under  different  types  of  currency  basket \narrangements.11  \nMany of the issues presented in  this  sub-section  were also faced  when the euro was \ncreated. In the European experience, a virtual currency (the European Currency Unit, ECU) \nwas initially used to denominate official cross-border transactions, but it eventually evolved \nto serve as the basis for a real, single currency (the euro) to which the exchange rates of \nindividual economies were irrevocable linked. Also, in Europe a major program was put in \nplace to fully integrate national financial markets into a single market, which until the onset of \nthe financial crisis was notably successful in erasing differences in national risk premiums.12 \nA full monetary union approach as in the case of Europe is an option, but other approaches \nthat would achieve similar benefits must be explored, as a monetary union is not generally \nconsidered feasible in the Asian context.  \n3.  INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE \nThis section investigates issues concerning the development of integrated financial markets \nin Asia and their role in financing regional infrastructure investment in Asia. It includes \nlessons for Asia from financial market integration initiatives in Europe and Latin America, \ncovering  both  the  creation  of  a  single  integrated  market  and  policy  investments  that \npromotes  infrastructure.  It  also  looks  at  the  potential  for  using  the  resources  held  in \nSovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) and mobilizing funds from Islamic Financial Markets. \n3.1  The European Union \nThe  integration  of  European  financial  markets  to  support  infrastructure  development  in \nEurope provides important lessons for Asia. Here, the pros and cons of different types of \nintegrated regional financial markets supporting infrastructure development are compared \nwith a base line of no integration and reliance on individual country markets to promote \ninfrastructure. \nThe European Monetary Union (EMU) (also called the Euro area) was created in 1999 \nbased on the Maastricht Treaty signed in 1992. It was the culmination of a long process of \neconomic, political, and social integration that began shortly after World War II. The process \nof financial sector integration in the EU since 1999 can be divided into four stages: \n\uf06c  Stage 1: In 1999, the Euro area monetary union was created with the euro as the \nsingle common currency. The euro was used as a virtual currency or accounting unit \nin  all  member  countries.  The  exchange  rate  of  each  national  currency  was \n                                                                                                                                                     \nreturns on Islamic bonds (sukuks) and conventional bonds for the same project are unlikely to ever fully \nconverge.  \n10 The use of a basket of currencies to create a standard measure of value is in some way like creating a virtual \ncurrency that can be used to denominate transactions and assets. A virtual currency might ultimately evolve \ninto a real currency, perhaps in the manner in which the European Currency Unit (ECU) morphed into the euro, \nbut evolution into a true currency is not inevitable, especially if political interest in creating a currency is \nmissing. \n11 Dealing with intertemporal consistency for a basket is a major challenge.  \n12 It is relevant to distinguish between technical financial issues and politico-economic issues in constructing an \nefficient capital market for cross-country infrastructure finance. The financial rationale for integration may be at \nodds with the political environment.  \n7 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \nirrevocably fixed against the euro, a single monetary policy was introduced and run \nby the European Central Bank (ECB), a common exchange rate and international \nreserves policy was created, and a euro-based clearing system was set up, among \nmany other actions. The key goals at this stage were implementation of a common \nmonetary and exchange policy.  \n\uf06c  Stage 2: In 2002, the existing national currencies were retired and the euro entered \ncirculation as a physical currency in all member countries. The changeover was \nquick and smooth. This fostered integration of currency markets, with free use of the \ncurrency throughout the union and elimination of national borders for currency.  \n\uf06c  Stage 3: The successful launch of the euro permitted the ECB to refocus attention to \nactively promote creation of a single financial market in which there would effectively \nbe no national borders for financial markets in Europe. An example is the Single \nEuropean Payments Area (SEPA) that seeks to make retail and business cross-\nborder transactions in Europe as easy and cheap as domestic transactions.  \n\uf06c  Stage 4: Geographic expansion of the union began with Greece joining the Euro \narea in 2001. In 2004, the EU expanded eastward and into the Mediterranean to \nbring  aboard  10  new  members.  Bulgaria  and  Romania  joined  the  EU  in  2007. \nSlovenia, Malta, and Cyprus have also already joined the Euro area and Slovakia \njoined in 2009. All the new EU countries are legally committed to join the monetary \nunion once they meet a set of  rigorous entry requirements.  \n3.1.1  Financial Market Integration \nThe  steps  toward  greater  financial  sector  integration  in  Europe  are  multifaceted  and \ncomplex. Many institutional and policy changes were introduced and harmonized between all \nmember countries and with union-level institutions.  \nThe European Currency Unit (ECU) began in 1975 as the European Unit of Account (EUA) \nto  serve  the  purpose  of  having  a  standardized  accounting  value  for  projects  involving \nmultiple  European  countries,  such  as  the  European  Development  Fund.  Following  the \nbreakup  of  the  Bretton  Woods  agreement  in  1971,  European  countries  lacked  fixed \nexchange  rates  to  denominate  transactions  between  countries  or  for  community-wide \npurposes. A common measure was needed to set the budget for the European Economic \nCommunity,  for  settlements  between  countries,  and  for  administering  the  Common \nAgricultural Policy and pricing agricultural commodities. Moreover, the measure of value also \nneeded to serve as a measure of future values in order to measure investments and their \ncosts and returns over time (EC 1984). \nIn  the  early  days  of  the  EMU,  implementation  of  the  single  monetary  policy  required \nintegration of money markets and markets in short-term capital and creation of a common \nsystem of clearing in the new currency, all backed up by institutions applying and enforcing \ncommon standards in all member countries. This was mandatory to ensure monetary control \nand permit transmission of monetary policy impulses throughout the Euro area. After that \ninitial stage, new actions and institutions began to be put into place in order to complete the \nintegration of European long-term capital markets and retail financial markets (Trichet 2006). \nBox 2 details the levels and types of European programs and institutions supporting financial \nintegration. \n8 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \n \nBox 2: Financial Integration Programs and Institutions in Europe \nTo support the goal of financial market integration, the ECB and other European institutions are involved in a wide range of \nregional financial programs. The programs fall into three areas: (i) programs that directly support monetary policy by permitting \nshort-term monetary policy impulses to course throughout the union; (ii) programs to enhance and integrate equity and bond \nmarkets; and (iii) programs to integrate business and retail financial markets. Each is considered as necessary to ensure the \noverall efficiency of the market and the effectiveness of the market in providing proper signals that will help channel investment \ninto priority markets throughout the continent.

The LGTT guarantee program of the European Investment Bank \n(EIB) and European Commission facilitates greater participation of the private sector in the \nTrans-European Transport Network Infrastructure (TEN-T). Networks cover transportation, \nenergy, and communications. The LGTT deals with the specific issue of guaranteeing \nservicing in the initial phases of a project\u2019s operations.  \nUnder the LGTT, the EIB incurs greater risk than in its normal lending. It backs stand-by \nfacilities (SBF) sold by lenders to borrowers that can cover servicing needs during the first \nyears of a project. The EIB and European Community (EC) each contribute equally in order \nto back up guarantees sold by banks providing infrastructure funding. The banks receive \nfee income for selling the guarantee, but because the guarantee substantially enhances \nthe quality of the credit, the bank should be able to offer significantly cheaper financing to \nthe borrower for the project. The reduction in risk and lower borrowing costs both will \nsupport increased infrastructure finance.  \nOnce a project is online, the borrower can draw on the SBF during the first five years if \nneeded to ensure payment of the senior line of credit. Payments of principal, interest, and \ninterest accruals are covered. The SBF is funded by the creditor bank. If the creditor bank \ncalls on the LGTT, the EIB makes payments and becomes a subordinated creditor on the \nproject. The EIB claims are subordinate to senior credits, but superior to equity. Several \noptions are provided to service the EIB claim after the senior credit obligations are fulfilled.  \nSource: European Investment Bank (2008) \nThis integration is a sign of the EMU\u2019s success. Furthermore, Ehrmann et al. (2007)13 found \nthat the creation of the union fostered significant integration of financial markets, creating \nsignificant improvements in the functioning of financial markets with the convergence in the \nlevels and co-movements of long-term sovereign bonds, in bond yield responses to common \nshocks, and in long-term inflation expectations built into bond yields toward the rates of the \ncountries with lowest inflation expectations. The integration of financial markets in the Euro \narea has brought down and stabilized bond yields by eliminating exchange rate risk and \ncreating confidence that the common monetary policy will achieve low inflation throughout \nthe union. Further contributing to the convergence are three additional elements integral to \nthe European economic environment: general macroeconomic convergence and stability, \ngovernment fiscal restraint, and financial sector stability.  \nTo support macroeconomic convergence and stability, European authorities moved toward \nmore intensive policy coordination and the strengthening of national institutions through \nstrong regulatory oversight. These actions, although indirect, create a system of strong \nnational institutions within the regional framework that facilitated cross-border investment \nand market integration.14  \n                                                 \n13 See also Baele et al.

The Maastricht Treaty specifies that deficits and government debt cannot exceed 3% and 60% of GDP, \nrespectively. The Growth and Stability Pact provides sanctions for countries that violate these limits. Also, the \nimportance of a strong and stable financial system to support monetary policy operations and to contribute to \nstrong economic growth was recognized. These factors, even though decentralized, contributed to clear \n10 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \n3.1.2. European Development Banking \nAlthough strong financial markets in Europe enable capital markets to finance much of the \ninfrastructure  requirements,  Europe  has  a  number  of  programs  to  provide  more  direct \nfunding of priority infrastructure, with emphasis on supporting funding in poorer regions or \nareas with special needs. Box 3 illustrates one innovative program to guarantee loans to \nsupport transportation infrastructure development. The European efforts show that even in a \nregion with ample capital market funding, special efforts are needed to directly provide \nlending for infrastructure or to provide a range of enhancements to investors to prompt their \ninvestment.  Another  broad  conclusion  is  that  great  flexibility  and  use  of  sophisticated \nfinancial engineering techniques are required to construct financial incentive packages that \nmake infrastructure projects attractive to potential investors. Extending the European model \nto Asia suggests that both an efficient regional integrated market and continuing official \nassistance are needed to support infrastructure development. \nIf  similar  approaches  were  attempted  in  Asia,  new,  well-capitalized  institutional \narrangements may be needed to emulate the results achieved in Europe, and continuing \nsources  of  concessional  funding  will  be  needed  to  cover  the  costs  of  incentives  and \nguarantees. Also, Asian development institutions can\u2014as is done in Europe\u2014serve as a \nsource of technical expertise and assistance in building local bond markets. The importance \nof development banking and concessional incentives is likely to be especially important over \nthe next several years because of the current crisis in financial markets, which has made \nmany investors hesitant to make commitments. \n3.1.3. Relevance of the European Financial Integration Program for Asia \nThe EMU places strong emphasis on development and integration of the financial markets, \nwhich may hold lessons for how markets should develop in Asia to support infrastructure \nfinance and support financial market efficiency in general. What lessons can be drawn for \nAsia from the EMU experience? \nForemost is the aggressive nature of the programs to integrate financial markets in Europe. \nThe efforts are explicitly tied to promoting innovation and competitiveness for the financial \nsector and to support the general economy. Improvements in the financial sector are seen \nas  directly  contributing  to  the  productivity  and  competitiveness  of  Europe  in  the  world \neconomy. Asian financial systems are starting from a less competitive position and will need \nto make continuing improvements to not fall further behind.  \nThe European system also directly addresses the diverse risks that can inhibit cross-border \ninvestment through the introduction of the euro, which eliminates currency risks in cross-\nborder transactions. In Asia, by contrast, infrastructure projects denominated in national \ncurrencies have currency risks affecting (1) investors via loss on investments denominated \nin a foreign currency; (2) servicing costs of projects that increase if the national currency \ndepreciates, and (3) cross-border projects where a relative exchange rate change for one \ncountry  could  jeopardize  the  project.  The  long-term  nature  of  infrastructure  investment \nincreases the probability of experiencing such exchange rate risks. Europe, through its wide \nrange  of  oversight,  market-building  efforts,  and  policy  lending  and  guarantees,  is  also \neffectively addressing other key risks including country risk, default risk, interest rate risk, \nand traffic risk (the danger that start-up traffic is insufficient to service debts). \nMoreover, within the integrated European system, effective oversight of individual member \ncountries through review of macroeconomic and fiscal policies is used to promote and \nachieve the benefits of integration and avoid possible collective destabilization. Asia is also \nslowly working to build and expand its economic oversight and policy dialog systems. The \n                                                                                                                                                     \nlessening of national risk in the bond markets, and fostered an environment conducive to cross-border \ninvestment. \n11 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \nrecent strengthening of the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI)15 and the recommendations of ADB \nInstitutes\u2019 (ADBI) capital flows management project16 are clear steps in the right direction \nthat  hopefully  will  be  further  advanced.  Potentially,  an  Asian  financial  market  oversight \nsystem or Asian Financial Markets Stability Forum could contribute to stronger and less \nvolatile financial markets for Asia. \nAn  enforcement  arm  in  the  Euro  area  makes  member  countries  abide  by  strict  rules \ngoverning  individual  country  economic  and  fiscal  policies,  which  are  embodied  in  their \nconvergence indicators, to create conditions conducive to overall macroeconomic and fiscal \nstability. Such a transnational enforcement tool does not exist in Asia. An alternative would \nbe to develop a set of Asian convergence indicators that would be published, thus using \nmarket discipline through disclosure as a tool to promote greater convergence. \nEurope applies many common standards and codes by regulation, but they often represent \nthe local application of internationally accepted standards, such as those in the fields of \naccounting, banking supervision, or payments systems. An alternative for Asia would be to \npromote and support regional adoption of international standards and codes, or adoption \nand establishment of a common Asian standard and codes. Asian adoption of international \nstandards is largely done locally, and although Asia is not at a point where a transnational \nbody can create and impose its own standards, more aggressive steps should be taken to \ncoordinate  across  Asian  countries  to  bring  all  systems  in  the  region  individually  and \ncollectively up to high levels of compliance with international standards. An Asian Financial \nStability Institution could provide leadership in this regard.17 \nConcessionary financing of incentives to promote bond markets would also be needed. This \ncould involve developing private insurance firms or a public infrastructure insurance firm to \ncover the various types of insurance or guarantees involved. A major challenge would be to \ngenerate the necessary capital infusion and annual receipt of contributions to the pool for \nconcessional financing.18 This pan-Asian entity would need to have some sort of oversight \nfunction of the instruments and entities it insures, and therefore would collaborate with \nsecurities and insurance supervisors. \nClearing and payments infrastructure development should be a high priority, as it was in \nEurope. The initiatives on clearing systems of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN) ministers in the 2007 ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint appear to have \nadvanced well and efforts can be made to move them to the implementation stage.  \nCreating cross-border adjudication mechanisms would also contribute to the success of \nregional integration. This is difficult in the absence of an overarching legal framework as \nexists  in  Europe,  but  wherever  possible  common  codes  and  documentation  should  be \ndeveloped. This convergence is being pursued aggressively in relation to trade and customs \ndocumentation, and a similar emphasis in the financial sphere would be welcome.19 A legal \nworking group could be created (as was done in Europe) to explore areas of convergence in \na legal framework to support financial market development. \n                                                 \n15 CMI was created in May 2000 by ASEAN+3 finance ministers in response to the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, \nusing the ASEAN+3 framework to expand the ASEAN Swap Arrangement and establish bilateral swap and \nrepurchase agreement facilities among ASEAN+3 countries (Henning 2002). \n16 For details see Kawai and Lamberte (2008). \n17 One of the first tasks of the FSF set up by the G-10 countries was to survey the range of international \nstandards and codes relevant for international financial stability. Twelve codes were identified as priorities for \ninternational implementation; a larger number of codes were identified as important, but less pressing. \n18 One option for creation of such a pool is to link contributions to the pool with redirected flows from SWFs \ntoward inward regional investment, or other efforts to manage capital flows associated with the SWFs.  \n19 ERIA (Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia) is a research body that conducts policy analysis \nand other research related to East Asian economic integration) will conduct research in this area. It was \nannounced on March 4, 2008, in Tokyo that ERIA would work on a blueprint to make East Asia the largest \nbusiness space in the world through harmonization of practices across countries, logistics improvements, and \nremoval of impediments to cross-border trade in goods and services. \n12 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \n3.1.4. Lessons for Asia \nThe  listing  of  programs  and  experiences  in  the  previous  subsections  indicates  the \nseriousness of the European effort to promote a high degree of integration of national \nfinancial markets within the EMU. Many gains in efficiency are envisioned and cuts in costs \nof maintaining separate financial markets have been estimated by the ECB to be equal to \nseveral percent of GDP. Direct actions were taken to strengthen integration and the common \noverarching legal and institutional framework also contributed importantly. \nSuch results are desirable goals for Asia as well in its efforts to promote financing for \ninfrastructure development. The European experience shows that creating the best situation \nfor Asia, where it could use its vast savings for regional infrastructure development, would \ninvolve eliminating barriers and frictions in cross-border financial flows so that funds move to \nwhere they are most productive, reducing currency-risk for cross-border finance through \npolicy dialog and recommendations that effectively reduce exchange rate volatility between \nthe Asian currencies, creating stable inflation expectations to eliminate inflation premiums in \nnational bond issues,  and reducing national risk premiums embedded in national bond \nprices. This would involve both reduction in sovereign risk due to poor government fiscal \nmanagement and a reduction in general country bond premiums by building expectations of \ngeneral macroeconomic and financial sector stability. \nProviding access for all national investment projects to deep and liquid markets so that there \nis price discovery, competitive pricing, limited volatility, a range of tenors, and comparable \nfinancing  costs  for  infrastructure  development  in  each  country  would  also  be  needed. \nAchieving  this  would  imply  that  investors  and  borrowers  throughout  Asia  would  have \nunrestricted access to regional financial centers, with a collateral system and surety of cross-\nborder settlement, as such liquidity can be generated only in larger, concentrated market \ncenters or through internet trading. \nAnother necessary component would be the building of comparable market indices. The \nyield curves of separate Asian financial markets should begin to converge over time and a \nbroad range of maturities should be available in order to most effectively encourage cross-\nborder and regional investment. \nThe aforementioned tasks add up to a heavy agenda, but it is one that Asia should seriously \nconsider, because in addition to supporting infrastructure investment, such initiatives would \nincrease policy effectiveness, create more effective markets that support growth, save costs, \nand, importantly, create a financial system that could be more competitive in relation to \nfinancial markets in Europe and America. Promoting financial market integration and bond \nmarket development has gained increasing traction because of the need to rebalance Asian \neconomies and increase the use of regional savings to support Asian investment priorities. \nAlso, there is a need to build effective and resilient financial markets that open up a wider \nrange of funding options and provide greater overall financial stability. \n4.  ADDRESSING ASIA\u2019S INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING \nGAP \n4.1. Countering the Financial and Economic Turmoil \nIn addition to the major challenges of financing infrastructure for future growth and improving \nthe lives of over two billion people, Asian and Pacific countries are facing headwinds from \nthe ongoing global financial and economic turmoil. The turmoil makes raising needed funds \nmore difficult, private sector investment is threatened in the short term and public finance is \nmore difficult. But it also increases the importance of infrastructure investment. If private \nflows of credit for infrastructure decline, governments and MDBs can look to infrastructure \ninvestments  for  stable,  long-term,  and  countercyclical  investments.  Also,  the  need  for \n13 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \ninfrastructure services as part of the social safety net in hard times might make it an even \nmore important priority. Thus, the crisis may change the nature of the challenges in building \ninfrastructure networks, but the needs for infrastructure are as, if not more, important than \never. For example, the stimulus package announced by PRC in 2009 totaling US$586 billion \nhad important infrastructure components\u2014rural infrastructure, roads, energy, railroads, and \nairports.  A  package  announced  in  2008  planned  to  spend  US$292  billion  for  railway \ndevelopment alone. Moreover, components of the package dealing with social welfare, such \nas education and health care, are likely to include an infrastructure component in the form of \nconstruction of new facilities (IFCE 2009; FAITC 2009).  \nThe  global  turmoil  and  economic  slowdown  will  hurt  the  finances  of  Asian  and  Pacific \ncountries. If exports drop and economic activity slows, total savings in the region will fall, \ngovernment tax revenues will decline, and additional expenditure for social security is likely. \nFunding for infrastructure will face stiffer competition from such other needs. At the same \ntime, global investors see their investable funds decrease, leading to drops in capital inflows \nfor portfolio investments and direct investment, and possibly shifts in capital outflows.  \nHowever, the special properties of infrastructure as long-term, steady investments that can \noffer investors lucrative returns make it suitable for countercyclical investment. Governments \nand multilateral lenders should accelerate infrastructure investment (compatible with overall \neconomic fundamentals) as a countercyclical tool and support long-term economic activity. \nThe returns on such investment will support future economic growth when conditions begin \nto improve. Moreover, there is potential to continue drawing in private investment from \ninstitutions, such as pension funds, that need outlets for long-term investments and, with the \nproper incentives and prospects for good, long-term returns, infrastructure investment may \nbe  seen  as  a  favored  investment  in  turbulent  times.  Additionally,  the  global  crisis  has \nsignificantly affected Asia\u2019s exports to advanced economies. Investing Asian savings for \nAsian  regional  connectivity  can  assist  in  rebalancing  Asia\u2019s  growth  from  high  export \ndependency  on  advanced  economies  to  enhanced  regional  demand  and  consumption \nthrough increased intraregional trade and cross-border investment.  \n4.2. Utilizing Asian Savings for Asian Infrastructure \nWhile a large financing gap for infrastructure development and maintenance does exist, \nAsian economies have huge savings and surpluses. At present, Asian savings are heavily \ninvested in developed countries in safe, but low yielding, securities, such as US treasury \nbills. At the same time, due to underdeveloped local capital markets much Asian savings are \ninvested in non-productive sectors, such as real estate or stock market speculation. This has \ncreated a global imbalance through financing advanced economies\u2019 consumption with cheap \nmoney supplied from huge Asian savings.  \nTo attract these savings into investments in productive sectors, there is a need to develop \nindigenous financial markets, particularly a strong bond market, as well as appropriate and \ninnovative financial instruments. Furthermore, innovative instruments and incentives will be \nneeded to create bankable projects and attract private sector participation. The following \nsection makes recommendations about how Asian savings might be refocused to serve \nAsian infrastructure needs. These recommendations will draw on the earlier discussions on \nmarket integration initiatives in Europe, the potential to use Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) \nresources  for  infrastructure  investment,  and  the  possible  role  of  Islamic  finance  in \ninfrastructure investment. \nNot addressed in this paper is a critical issue of the sequencing of changes to bolster \nfinancial market integration. The question is whether financial market integration in Asia is \nbest achieved in stages. The stronger and financially more sophisticated economies could \nachieve integration first, with other economies following. A complex mix of technical and \npolitical factors will affect this decision. However, there is serious concern that those left out \nare increasingly uncompetitive and once left out are soon forgotten.

Financing Institutions for Regional Infrastructure Investment in \nAsia \n4.3.1 Pan-Asian and Subregional Infrastructure Funds \nIt is proposed that a series of special funds be set up that will support financing projects at \nboth national and regional levels by identifying, prioritizing, designing, and then promoting \nthe development of infrastructure projects. There is a need for a pan-Asian and/or a series of \nsubregional  infrastructure  funds  dedicated  to  cross-border  projects  to  enhance  Asia\u2019s \nconnectivity and move toward the creation of a seamless Asia. These can be best thought of \nas multi-donor platforms that provide good means to collect and administer funds received \nand then have flexibility to move them according to suitable priorities and sequencing. \nSuch funds could be administered in a variety of ways and it is not necessary to set up new \ninstitutions, though that is always a possibility. For example, ADB could be the administrator \nof all or some of the funds as trust funds, a participant with other partners, or an investor in a \nnew entity. Whatever the structure (which is a policy issue) it is important that the funds \nperform certain important functions in support of infrastructure development and financing.  \nThe  first  need  is  identifying,  prioritizing,  designing,  and  promoting  the  development  of \ninfrastructure projects. The quality of this process is critical because the goal is to produce a \nlist of well-designed, bankable projects that accurately describe the benefit, costs, and risks \nof projects in ways that make clear how they are good bets for large public and private \ninvestments. These funds can be supported by creating a special joint grant facility by ADB \nand  other  MDBs  and  bilateral  contributors,  such  as  the  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation (JBIC) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), to help identify \nand  prepare  bankable  cross-border  projects.  These  funds  need  to  provide  grants  and \nconcessional  financing  to  Asian  countries  that  have  low-incomes  and  low  technical \ncapacities to reduce asymmetric costs and distribute benefits among participating countries.  \nThese funds might include private sector participation, which could be necessary to obtain \nadequate funding. Such private sector participation may also be designed to provide access \nto technical or industry expertise of the private sector, such as creating consortiums of firms \nin rail development or port logistics. The interface with the private sector would help in \nidentifying  and  designing  bankable  cross-border  projects  and  in  negotiating  with \ngovernments and potential private investors sectors. Finally, the fund would need to consider \nhow to provide necessary incentives to countries (particularly low income ones) to agree to \nand implement cross-border projects. One option is to provide concessional funds to low-\nincome  developing  countries  who  may  not  receive  proportionate  benefits  compared  to \nmiddle-income countries participating in a regional project.  \n4.3.2. Reserve Bank of Asia \nAgarwala (2008) proposed the establishment of a Reserve Bank of Asia (RBA) to address \nthe infrastructure financing gap of Asia, both at national and regional levels, and also to \nserve as a type of regional central bank. The RBA would have an authorized capital of about \nUS$300 billion, 10% of which could be in the form of paid up capital. The bank would have \nauthority to borrow from the central banks of Asia about 10% of their foreign exchange \nreserves at the rate of return on 30-year US Treasury Bills and to invest them in global \nequity indices.20 The bank would utilize the profits earned to promote infrastructure in a \npublic-private partnership mode.  \n                                                 \n20 The source of funding of the RBA is a critical variable in its financing and mode of operation. If funds are taken \nfrom official reserve assets, then the RBA must hold the funds in a liquid form in which they are readily usable \nin case of balance of payments need of the participating countries. Also, if the national contributors have a \nnegative carrying cost on the contributions, it is unclear why the net profit from RBA investments should accrue \nto the RBA and not the countries. (Conversely, if the pooling of funds by the RBA permits countries to hold \n16 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \nThe RBA would also be authorized to act like a regional monetary fund or central bank. It \nwould have authority to provide balance of payments support to member countries when \nneeded and to issue an Asian Currency Unit (ACU) as a parallel (co-circulating) currency \nthat would be freely convertible internationally. These aspects are not very different from the \nconcepts of the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (EMCF) and the European Currency \nUnit (ECU) set up in Europe in the 1970\u2019s.  \nThe  option  of  creating  a  co-circulating  currency,  as  proposed  by  Agarwala  (2008),  is \nappealing in many respects, especially if it benefits economies undergoing financial turmoil \nthat have weak and depreciating currencies. Other such proposals have been made, and in \na sense the European Currency Unit (ECU) was almost a type of co-circulating unit of value \nthat was used for public and private financial instruments in Europe. The Asian Infrastructure \nCurrency Unit (AICU) proposed later on in this study has potential to develop into a co-\ncirculating currency. However, there are many challenging operational aspects, such as solid \nfunding of the alternative central bank, clearing and settlement, sharing of seigniorage, and \nnot destabilizing regular currencies and monetary policies. \nThe  creation  of  the  RBA,  combining  functions  of  a  reserve  bank  and  an  infrastructure \nfinancing bank like ADB, is without precedent and may not be feasible. In the past, ADB had \nperformed the functions of the proposed RBA when it provided quick adjustment loans to \nsome Asian crisis-affected countries, such as the Republic of Korea (hereafter Korea), but \nthis was far more limited than the arrangement conceived by Agarwala (2008). Moreover, \ncreating a formal regional central banking system parallel to national central banks, each \nwith their own monetary policies and exchange rates, is challenging. It may be a better \nstrategy  to  keep  the  investment  aspects  separate  (handled  by  an  expanded  ADB  that \nadministers a new Asia infrastructure fund), and have a separate monetary institute that can \npromote a long-term financial integration program. \n4.3.3. Multilateral and Bilateral Development Institutions  \nMultilateral development banks (MDBs) have an important role to play in reducing funding \ngaps if private sector funds do not meet financing needs. MDBs can also facilitate regional \ncooperation  for  the  provision  of  regional  public  goods,  such  as  sharing  services  and \nresources  among  neighboring  countries  through  cross-border  collective  action  and \ncoordination.  Through  financing  regional  infrastructure,  MDBs  can  assist  countries  in \nachieving the full potential of cross-border trade and investment, as well as improving their \ncompetitiveness in the region by reducing trade costs, especially cross-border costs, by \nhelping to improve transport and logistics systems, procedures, and protocols and supply \nchain management. \nMDBs,  such  as  ADB  and  the  World  Bank,  are  already  playing  an  important  role  in \ninfrastructure development by creating bankable projects and mobilizing long-term funds \nthrough  capital  markets  and  arranging  co-financing.  Bilateral  development  banks  or \nagencies  like  JICA  and  JBIC,  are  also  playing  a  useful  role,  and  similar  bilateral \ndevelopment banks in major Asian economies, such as PRC, Singapore, Korea, and India, \ncan also contribute to the provision of financing facilities. To reduce large financing gaps, \nMDBs need to expand their roles in mobilizing funding, particularly in arranging co-financing \nand providing loan and financing guarantees. Moreover, MDBs can create appropriate and \ninnovative financial instruments for PPP projects to encourage private sector investment and \ncan also promote further integration and enhancement of Asian financial market efficiency, \nliquidity, and depth, with adherence to international and regional standard best practices. \nThis  will  enhance  cross-border  flows  of  capital  and  promote  efficient  infrastructure \ninvestment utilizing Asia\u2019s huge savings. \n                                                                                                                                                     \nlower balances of reserve assets, it could permit the countries to make more profitable use of their funds.) If \ncontributions to the RBA come from sovereign wealth funds or other national assets, the countries may expect \nto participate in any higher returns.  \n17 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \nBy acting jointly as money banks, knowledge banks, capacity builders, and honest brokers, \nMDBs can continue to support Asia\u2019s infrastructure development. Utilizing their AAA ratings \nand ability to raise funds in international capital markets at and lending funds with low \nspreads, MDBs should be active in providing loans and guarantees and catalyzing private \nsector financing. These institutions can also continue to be a key source of policy and \ntechnical advice, assisting in building the \u201csoft infrastructure\u201d (i.e., legal, regulatory, policy, \ncustoms,  and  procedural  components)  in  member  country  governments  and  regional \ninstitutions. Finally, MDBs can play a key role coordinating multiple stakeholders for regional \nintegration and infrastructure development. ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation and Integration \n(RCI)  Strategy  passed  in  October  2006,  for  example,  promotes:  (i)  cross-border \ninfrastructure and associated soft infrastructure, especially greater cross-border physical \nconnectivity  and  (ii)  regional  cooperation  in  the  provision  of  regional  public  goods  and \navoidance of regional public \u201cbads\u201d, (such as pollution and Green House Gas emissions). \nThese kinds of roles and responsibilities by MDB activities in the region should be further \nenhanced to better facilitate regional infrastructure development and financing. \nAsia needs to funnel its massive savings into \u201cbankable\u201d projects, primarily through bond \nmarket development and better use of savings and foreign reserves. In view of this, it is \nimportant to continue developing Asia\u2019s bond market (through the ABMI) to improve regional \nfinancial intermediation. MDBs can contribute to this process by providing further technical \nand research assistance to ABMI Working Groups and Focal Group of the ABM Initiative, \nstimulating market activities by issuing prime name credit papers and local currency bonds, \npromoting transparency and information dissemination, and contributing to policy dialogue. \nIn the past, ADB in particular has been a reliable funder of a large and broad variety of \ndevelopment projects in Asia, including cross-border infrastructure. It has historically offered \ntraditional financing and other types of assistance at competitive rates, in the form of loans, \nequity financing, various financial risk guarantees, syndication arrangements, and technical \nassistance. More recently, it has also begun financing projects through the use of local \ncurrency  financing,  finance  for  trade  facilitation,  securitization,  mortgage  financing,  and \nservicing of non-performing or under-performing financial assets (ADB 2008a). Clearly, there \nis room for greater assistance of MDBs in the development of cross-border infrastructure, \neither as sole investors or in partnerships with other institutions. Recently, ADB\u2019s capital has \ntripled  to  $165  billion,  which  will  facilitate  mobilizing  additional  funds  for  infrastructure \ninvestment and poverty reduction in Asia (ADB 2009b).  \nMDBs can also promote projects that could be considered as \u201cAid for Trade\u201d, perhaps in \ncoordination with the World Trade Organization (WTO). Aid for Trade, according to the \nWTO, is donor financing from developed and developing countries that is invested in soft \ninfrastructure, such as trade-promoting infrastructure and assistance projects, including aid \nfor supply chains and industrial (i.e., capacity) development. In 2005, a total of US$15 billion \nwas committed to Aid for Trade by highly developed countries, including US$10 billion from \nJapan (ADB 2007). Such support continues to be forthcoming and assisting in structuring \ndeals  and  projects  so  they  meet  the  provisions  of  Aid  for  Trade  programs  is  of  great \nimportance and is another way that MDBs can play an active role in obtaining increased \nfinancing for cross-border infrastructure. \n4.3.4. Local Currency Bond Markets  \nThe development of local currency bond markets is a key method to reduce foreign currency \nrisk for borrowers and should be promoted to meet growing infrastructure financing needs. \nDeveloping these markets would also minimize currency and maturity mismatches, which \nwere among the major factors behind the severe financial crisis in 1997\u20131998. Currency \nmismatch problems arise if countries borrow in foreign currency to finance infrastructure \nprojects and the revenues are earned is in local currency. On the other hand, if countries \nborrow foreign currency for the short-term or medium-term, but the cash flow lags after the \n18 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \ncompletion of the project, there could be maturity mismatch problems. This is a demand risk \nproblem that can be addressed through official foreign currency guarantees. \nSince the 1997\u20131998 financial crisis, Asian economies have undertaken considerable efforts \nto  further  develop  and  strengthen  institutions  and  market  infrastructure  to  enhance  the \ngrowth of local currency bond markets. In 2003, finance ministers from ASEAN plus Japan, \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and Korea introduced the ABMI. Several working \ngroups were established to develop the infrastructure, regulations, and best practices of the \nlocal currency bond markets. Such an initiative can promote the utilization of Asia\u2019s savings \nand  increasing  foreign  exchange  reserves  within  the  region,  particularly  for  use  in \ninfrastructure  development.  The  creation  of  standing  working  groups  to  promote  the \ndevelopment of various aspects of financial market infrastructure is a strong step in the right \ndirection and should continue to be aggressively pursued. \nAt the Madrid ADB annual meeting in May 2008, the commitment to the ABMI was renewed \nwith a focus on promoting local currency bond issuance, facilitating demand for the bonds, \nimproving the regulatory framework, and improving the market infrastructure. Efforts are \nvoluntary, but each country is tasked to make periodic self-assessments in meeting the \nABMI goals. All these steps, which are at the national level of integration with some regional \noversight, appear to be moving in the right direction, but it remains to be seen how effective \nthe approach will be. \nMDBs, as banks with continuing involvement in capital markets, can play an important role in \nraising long-term funds for financing infrastructure projects, contributing to building market \nliquidity and depth and issuing local currency bonds by undertaking currency swaps. The \nADB has been integral in developing Asia\u2019s bond market by providing technical and research \nassistance to ABMI Working Groups and the Focal Group of the ABMI; stimulating market \nactivities by issuing prime name credit papers; promoting transparency and information \ndissemination; contributing to policy dialogue; and issuing local currency bonds.21 \nIn order to attract private investors for local currency infrastructure bonds, the return should \nbe  attractive  and  high  rated.  According  to  a  report  by  Asia  Bond  Monitor,  the  policy \nchallenges for the development of a stable, deep, and strong bond market include:  \n\u201c(i)  bolster investor confidence by strengthening legal protection and thus certainty, \nimprove  standards  of  corporate  governance  and  transparency,  and  adhere  to \ninternational accounting standards; \n(ii) reduce constraints to market entry, investment, and encourage investor diversity \nto promote greater demand for local currency bonds;  \n(iii) develop derivative and swap markets to broaden the investor base, increase \nmarket liquidity, and allow a wider dispersal of risk; and  \n(iv) strengthen  broader  arrangements  for  regulatory  oversight  and  regional \ncooperation  in  the  areas  of  information-sharing  and  in  coordinated  actions  to \nmaintain financial stability\u201d (ADB 2008b: 1-2). \n4.3.5. Asian Infrastructure Financing Bank or Fund \nAn important issue to be examined is whether Asia should establish a new, specialized \ninvestment bank for infrastructure financing similar to the European Investment Bank or the \nAndean Development Corporation (Corporaci\u00f3n Andina de Fomento, or CAF). This bank \n                                                 \n21 ADB has issued several local currency bonds. In October 2005, ADB launched its fifth market-opening \ntransaction P2.5 billion (US$45.37 million) peso-denominated bonds to develop Asia\u2019s local currency bond \nmarkets. Starting in early 2004, ADB undertook five other market-opening transactions in the region's local \ncurrency bond markets in India, Malaysia, PRC, the Philippines, and Thailand. In 2007, the ADB issued local \ncurrency bonds in Hong Kong, China; Kazakhstan; Malaysia; Philippines; and Singapore. Moreover, according to \nAsia Bond Monitor (2008), emerging East Asia\u2019s local currency (LCY) bonds outstanding increased at a very \nrapid annual 21% rate in the second half of 2007. Also, LCY government bond markets expanded by 21% in \n2007, primarily due to central bank sterilization and fiscal stimulus. LCY corporate bonds grew by 20% in 2007, \nexhibiting the limited initial impact of the global credit crisis.  \n19 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \nmight  serve  to  intermediate  (through  deposit  facilities,  bond  issuance,  and  transactions \nservices) the use of the large accumulations of official financial assets for infrastructure and \nother  regional  and  development  projects.  Another  alternative  could  be  a  new  Asia \nInfrastructure Fund (AIF) which could be managed by ADB. This fund could be dedicated to \nregional infrastructure projects. The new bank or fund may consider issuing liabilities in the \nform of equities and bonds to be contributed by participating countries and multilateral and \nbilateral development banks as well as private sector using some standard measure to \ndenominate investments, such as a regional currency basket. The participating countries can \nuse a portion of their excess foreign reserve to purchase these bonds.  \nThere  have  been  previous  proposals  for  establishing  either  an  Asian  Infrastructure \nInvestment Bank (AIIB) or an Asian Infrastructure Finance Corporation (AIFC). For example, \nin  2007,  Kim  Hak-Su,  executive  secretary  of  the  United  Nations  Economic  and  Social \nCommission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), stated that the region could learn from \nIndia\u2019s  experiences  utilizing  special  purpose  vehicles  for  infrastructure  investment.  The \nregion could authorize an entity such as AIIB or AIFC to borrow from regional foreign \nexchange reserves and both invest in capital and equity markets globally\u2014using the returns \nto finance regional infrastructure projects\u2014as well as provide direct lending for infrastructure \nfinancing (UNESCAP 2007). Agarwala (2005) judged that such an Asian Investment Bank \n(AIB) could provide infrastructure loans and collaborate with the banking community in both \nraising and investing resources. It could work with the private sector by co-financing and \nguaranteeing private investment financing. Even if only 50% of Asia\u2019s incremental current \naccount surpluses during the next five years are put in these assets, there would be ample \nfunding for the huge investment needs in these regional projects. Besides raising funds, this \ninstitution  could  also  help  regional  countries  address  non-financial  constraints  that \ndiscourage  infrastructure  investment  by  the  private  sector;  these  constraints  could  be \nregulatory barriers, lengthy processes or procedures, and risks involved in long-term and \nlarge-scale investment (Jayanth 2007).  \nHowever, there would be many disadvantages in setting up a new investment bank. First, \nnegotiation, planning, and implementation of a new large institution would be lengthy and \npossibly less cost-effective than using existing institutions. The bank would need to establish \na credible track record to ensure trust and confidence among member countries and their \nprivate sectors. Furthermore, the overall cost of borrowing could be higher compared with \nestablished institutions due to the additional operational cost of the bank and the bank\u2019s \ninitial smaller scale of operation and initial lack of the AAA ratings necessary for the bank to \nmobilize funds at a low cost in the international capital market. \nIt would also be challenging for a new bank to create an adequate knowledge base and \nexpertise comparable to that of existing institutions, which is essential for winning the trust \nand confidence of participating Asian countries. Organizations such as ADB, the World \nBank,  and  UNESCAP  have  solid  track  records  in  providing  significant  assistance  for \ninfrastructure development in Asia and conceiving and implementing cross-border projects \nunder several subregional programs, such as Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), South Asia \nSubregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC), Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \n(CAREC), Brunei Darussalam Indonesia Malaysia Philippines \u2013 East ASEAN Growth Area \n(BIMP-EAGA),  and  Bay  of  Bengal  Initiative  for  Multi-Sectoral  Technical  and  Economic \nCooperation (BIMSTEC)22. For example, ADB has provided approximately US$83 billion to \ndate in infrastructure loans and grant financing in the region, and has strong financial and \nrisk management capacity and practices and international-level disclosure standards. The \nresources of these organizations, however, are still limited and would be insufficient to meet \nthe entire financing gap (ADB 2009a).  \n                                                 \n22 Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC), Central Asia \nRegional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC),  Brunei  Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-The  Philippines-East \nASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA), Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-sectoral Technical and Economic \nCooperation (BIMSTEC). \n20 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \nIn view of the above, an Asian Infrastructure Financing Fund (or a special vehicle fund) could \nbe set up under an appropriate governance structure such as an affiliate, subsidiary, or trust \nfund managed by ADB. This fund should have its own resources or capital contributed from \nnational governments of major Asian countries. In addition, this fund could intermediate and \ndirect Asian savings to infrastructure development and assist in meeting the infrastructure \ninvestment  gap  by  selling  bonds  for  cross-border  infrastructure  finance,  customizing \ninstruments to fit market preferences, and potentially providing guarantees, incentives, and \nconcessionary finance. It could also generate additional funds through co-financing from \nother  development  and  financial  institutions,  SWFs,  pension  funds,  private  portfolio \ninvestments,  and  special  vehicle  funds.  A  portion  of  major  Asian  countries\u2019  excess \ninternational reserves could be utilized initially to set up such a fund. A new institutional \nframework for this fund would allow for more flexible rules, regulations, policies, systems, \nand procedures. This fund could be structured to identify, prioritize, prepare, and facilitate \nfinancing commercially viable regional infrastructure projects. For making the projects viable, \nthe fund needs to provide guarantees against major risks (e.g. political risk, credit risk, and \nrefinancing risk) faced by large cross-border projects, as well as grant and concessional \nfinancing to low-income participating countries. .  \nThe advantages of this new infrastructure fund would include a more focused mission for \nspecialized jobs like cross-border infrastructure financing, and the creation of simpler and \nmore efficient systems and procedures, such as the quick processing of loans with few \nconditions that borrowing member countries find difficult to implement and can delay project \nimplementation and  increase project  cost.  Also, it  would offer better customization and \nsophisticated techniques to meet borrower countries\u2019 needs and the utilization of Asian \nsavings for Asian infrastructure in a cost effective manner. ADB/ADBI (2009) has proposed a \nsimilar Asian Infrastructure Fund.  \n4.3.6. Regional Infrastructure Companies for Financing Specific Sectors \nAnother alternative could be to create several regional companies that would finance and \nmanage regional projects for specific sectors, such as transport (road, railways, seaports \nand airports), energy, and telecommunications. Major Asian economies could invest in these \ncompanies together, allowing for private sector participation at a later stage. Experts from \nvarious parts of Asia, and also from outside Asia, could be invited to join these companies. \nThese companies could also raise funds from capital markets through equity or infrastructure \nbonds. Special sub-regional infrastructure funds could be created to finance sub-regional \nprojects.  \nThis  alternative  might  take  the  form  of  the  European  Aeronautic  Defense  and  Space \nCompany  (EADS),  which  would  be  jointly  owned  by  Asian  governments,  public  sector \ncompanies, or both together. An Asian infrastructure group for cross-border infrastructure \ndevelopment established akin to the EADS could be owned by Asian governments, relevant \nregional  public  sectors,  and  private  sector  firms  with  appropriate  expertise  in  the \ninfrastructure development. The sale of public shares throughout the region would help \ndeepen equity markets and provide a needed outlet for household savings and institutions\u2019 \ninvestment  funds.  This  group  could  own  subsidiaries  specializing  in  sectors,  such  as \ntransport, energy, and telecommunications. Infrastructure companies need to specialize in a \nsector to earn credibility, and hence sectoral Asian companies (specializing in transport, \ntelecommunication, energy, etc.) would need to be established. Subsequently, a significant \nportion  of  shares  could  be  distributed  to  the  public  and  employees  to  create  a  good \ngovernance structure. Multiple locations for operations could be selected depending on \nlocations of planned cross-border projects.  \n4.3.7. Subregional Infrastructure Funds or Subregional Infrastructure Companies \nThere are already several subregional initiatives on infrastructure development in Asia, such \nas GMS, ASEAN, South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), CAREC, and \n21 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \nSASEC. Special subregional infrastructure funds could be created to finance sub-regional \nprojects.  Special  subregional  companies  could  also  be  established  to  manage  these \ninfrastructure projects. Such subregional institutions could work in a way similar to that \ndescribed in sections 4.3.5 and 4.3.6. Recently, ASEAN has decided to set up an ASEAN \nInfrastructure  Fund  through  ADB,  which  in  turn  is  now  preparing  the  fund\u2019s  needed \nframework  (Nam  News  Network  2010).  It  is  possible  that  this  fund  could  initially  be \nestablished by major ASEAN countries utilizing their excess international reserves, and the \nother  ASEAN  countries  would  be  allowed  to  join  subsequently.  Once  this  ASEAN \nInfrastructure Fund has been created, other major Asian countries could join to create an \nASEAN+323 or an ASEAN+624 infrastructure fund. This process is similar to the pattern \nobserved in the Asian trade integration using ASEAN as a hub and forming the ASEAN+1 \nfree trade agreement.  \n4.4. Instruments for Financing Asia\u2019s Regional Infrastructure \n4.4.1. Guaranteed and Linked Bonds \nInfrastructure projects could also be financed through innovative bond structures that would \ninclude guarantees or enhancements to protect investors in terms of various risks, insulate \nborrowers from adverse changes in servicing costs, and customize issues to fit the specific \nneeds  of  lenders  and  borrowers.  Contemporary  financial  markets  have  become  quite \nsophisticated in fashioning instruments to cover specific situations and to appeal to different \nclasses  of  borrowers.  Where  these  techniques  could  be  married  with  availability  of \nconcessional finance, it could be possible to craft lending instruments that could strongly \npromote economic development. \nCustomization could involve enhancing instruments with one or more guarantees, links that \nwould provide protection against specific types of risk, or spreading returns and risks to \nbetter fit the profiles of lenders and borrowers. A wide range of instruments could provide the \nenhancements\u2014direct guarantees or insurance could be used, derivatives like forwards and \noptions would be possible, income and expense flows could be capped, income flows could \nbe swapped, instruments could be linked to commodity prices or other measures, etc.\u2014\ndepending on the specific borrowing situation and the sophistication of markets in crafting \ninstruments. Types of risks and examples of instruments that could be use to mitigate them \ncould include: \n \nRisk  Instrument \nExchange rate guarantees; \nExchange risk \nCurrency Baskets \nInflation risk  Inflation-linked instruments \nCommodity price risk  Commodity price-linked instruments \nCredit risk  Credit guarantees \nDemand (traffic) risk  Demand (traffic) guarantees \nEconomic risk  GDP-linked instruments25 \n                                                 \n23 ASEAN+3 is composed of ASEAN member countries plus PRC, Korea, and Japan. \n24 ASEAN+6 is composed of ASEAN+3 plus Australia, New Zealand, and India. \n25 GDP-linked instruments adjust payments to the speed of growth of GDP of the borrowing country. There is a \ngrowing body of literature recommending the use of GDP-linked bonds. For borrowers, they can lower debt \nservice payments in times of economic distress, allowing for greater fiscal policy flexibility and lowering the \nprobability of default. For investors, GDP-linked bonds provide opportunities to diversify portfolios and can offer \nhigh returns if payments are linked to nominal GDP growth. In this latter case, the borrowers are de facto \nprotected from real obligations to make higher payments because of the larger size of GDP and also the \npossibility that there is an inflationary component in the higher nominal GDP. \nSee, for example: Borensztein and Mauro (2002), Griffith-Jones and Sharma (2006), Miyajima (2006), Schr\u00f6der \net al. (2004), and Shiller (1993). \n22 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \n \nFinancial sophistication would be needed to design and implement the full range of these \ninstruments.  Cross-border  issues  would  require  additional  skills  to  deal  with  differing \ninstitutions,  practices,  and  legal  frameworks.  Only  a  limited  number  of  institutions  and \nmarkets could be expected to provide the range of skills required, which could reside both in \npublic institutions and private markets. Asian financial market development would benefit \nfrom the building of such skills at ADB, other Asian public institutions, and also in key \nregional private markets. Infrastructure projects in countries that do not have the skills \navailable domestically would have to have ready and cost efficient access to markets where \nthey are available. ADB or other regional public institutions could deal directly with projects \nanywhere in the region, but it would also be important to have easy cross-border access to \nprivate markets in key financial centers within Asia.  \n4.4.2. Sovereign Wealth Funds \nSeveral Asian economies, as well as economies of other regions, have created sovereign \nwealth funds (SWFs) to hold and invest part of their large holdings of international reserve \ncurrencies. This subsection examines the potential for SWFs, and other large national pools \nof investable funds such as national pension funds, to invest in Asian infrastructure. The \nspecific character of infrastructure investments often fits the investment profile of SWFs. \nMoreover, the global financial crisis has highlighted the usefulness of regional infrastructure \ninvestment  as  an  important  source  of  stimulus  funding  as  short-  or  medium-term \ncountercyclical measures, but that also offers high,  long-term economic benefits. It  will \ndescribe an important initiative in this regard by ASEAN to set up a regional infrastructure \nfund that will draw on resources similar to SWFs, and which may become a model for use of \nSWFs for infrastructure funding.  \nThe best source of information on SWFs is the initial report of the International Working \nGroup on Sovereign Wealth Funds (IWG) that presents 24 voluntary Generally Accepted \nPrinciples and Practices (GAPP) for SWFs, called the \u201cSantiago Principles\u201d (IWG 2008). 26 \nSWFs are defined by the working group as: \n \u201cSpecial  purpose  investment  vehicles  or  arrangements  owned  by  the  general \ngovernment.  Created  by  the  general  government  for  macroeconomic  purposes, \nSWFs  hold,  manage,  or  administer  assets  to  achieve  financial  objectives,  and \nemploy  a  set  of  investment  strategies  that  include  investing  in  foreign  financial \nassets. SWFs have diverse legal, institutional, and governance structures. They are \na heterogeneous group, comprising fiscal stabilization funds, savings funds, reserve \ninvestment  corporations,  development  funds,  and  pension  reserve  funds  without \nexplicit pension liabilities\u201d (IWG 2008: 3). \nThe formal definition of SWFs excludes foreign currency reserves assets held by monetary \nauthorities for traditional balance of payments or monetary policy purposes, state-owned \nenterprises, government employee pension funds, and assets managed for the benefit of \nindividuals. These are important exclusions, but for the purposes of this study on a case-by-\ncase basis the investment profiles of such funds might include infrastructure investments. \nFor example, state-owned enterprises might seek infrastructure investments ancillary to their \nmain line of business. Thus, these non-SWF pools of investable funds might be approached \nwith investment proposals, but they will not be further discussed here.  \nMany SWFs segregate funds into accounts separate from countries\u2019 official international \nreserves to generate higher returns and many are explicitly designed to pass wealth to future \n                                                 \n26 The IWG was set up as an ad hoc group to determine the principles of conduct for SWF and treatments in host \ncountries. The GAPP agreement is an important step forward in understanding the nature of SWFs and making \nthem more accountable and transparent, but the code is voluntary and adoption by all SWFs is not assured. \nWork is underway to build on the achievements of the IWG to create a standing body to represent SWFs. See \nalso IMF (2008).  \n23 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \ngenerations, especially when the income is derived from exploitation of an expendable \nresource. 27 Although the capital and income from SWFs are intended for strategic or future \nuse, the rules to draw on SWFs vary by country and have often not been transparent, \nalthough application of the GAPP could change that. It has been reported that during the \ncrisis a number of SWFs have been tapped as stimulus funds for domestic projects. \nIn broad terms, three different types of SWFs can be distinguished. Different investment \nstrategies and policy perspectives may apply to each type. \n\u2022  Commodity-based  SWFs:  These  SWFs  are  based  on  high  returns  from  the \nproduction of commodities. Strong demand and favorable price movements for a \ncommodity, such as oil, can result in rapid accumulations of foreign currency assets. \nThese funds are unencumbered assets that are not associated with specific liabilities \nand thus can be freely invested by the SWFs in accordance with their directives. \nCountries with these types of SWFs may create them to isolate funds from the \ndomestic economy, use them as stabilization funds to cushion drops in prices, or \nbuild long-term investment income to support the economy after the resource is \ndepleted.  The  funds  might  also  be  domestically  invested  to  help  the  economy \ndiversify, but such investment must avoid destabilizing the economy. \n\u2022  Pension-based  SWFs:  Some  countries  create  SWFs  from  funds  raised  from \npension or social security contributions (funds with explicit liabilities to individual \npension  holders  are  excluded).  These  funds  must  be  invested  with  a  long-term \nperspective and with recognition of the liability to cover future payments. Long-term \ninfrastructure investments with stable return profiles fit the investment needs of this \ntype of SWF well. \n\u2022  SWFs  for  countries  with  a  large  current  account  surplus  and  large international \nreserve assets. The assets are often acquired due to sterilization of export earnings, \nwhich creates a liability to the public. PRC and several other Asian economies have \nthis type of accumulation of foreign currency assets that can be used to fund SWFs. \nThese types of SWFs often play a key role in the macro-financial stance of the \ncountry and can affect policies on exchange rates, capital flows, inflation, and money \nand credit. The investment strategies of these types of funds must not contradict the \nsterilization policies that led to their creation in the first place, but are otherwise \nflexible.  Because  this  type  of  SWF  is  based  on  an  explicit  policy  configuration, \nchanges in the policies (such as an exchange rate appreciation or shifts in national \nabsorption) can affect the SWF, including the possibility of slowing or capping the \nSWF\u2019s  future  growth.  These  types  of  SWFs  may  be  constrained  from  making \ndomestic infrastructure investments because they were launched to isolate the funds \nfrom the domestic economy, but they could do so if it is compatible with balanced \nmacroeconomic  conditions.  However,  they  might  be  good  sources  for  regional \ninfrastructure funding. \nTable 3 lists 13 Asian and Pacific countries (including Russia) that are often considered to \nhave SWFs. The SWFs themselves have different functions and range in size. Estimates of \nthe size of assets held by SWFs vary widely, but the Asian SWFs listed below appear to hold \nsomewhere between US$700 and US$950 billion, which is about one-third of total assets \nheld by the more than 30 SWFs currently operating worldwide. By size of total assets in \nearly 2008, the largest SWFs in Asia were in the PRC, Singapore, Russia, and Australia. \n                                                 \n27 International reserve assets serve a special purpose to be available for exchange rate policy and to deal with \nbalance of payments imbalances. According to the IMF definition of reserves, they must be readily available \nand in a readily convertible currency, SDRs, or monetary gold. The requirement that reserves have high \nliquidity precludes their use for long-term investments, such as those made by SWFs. Countries with reserves \nexceeding balance of payments needs can transfer them to SWFs to allow for their long-term investment. Also, \nincome generated on international reserves is usually low (and sometimes negative, net, if reserves are built \nup by issuing high-interest rate liabilities to sterilize the monetary impacts of foreign currency assets held by \nthe public). SWFs have the flexibility to invest in higher return assets.  \n24 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \nTable 3: Selected Asian Sovereign Wealth Funds \nCountry  Sovereign Wealth Fund \nAustralia   Australian Future Fund \nAzerbaijan   State Oil Fund \nBrunei Darussalem   Brunei Investment Authority \nPRC  China Investment Corporation (CIC) \nIran   Development Fund \nKazakhstan   National Fund \nKiribati   Revenue Equalization Fund \nKorea  Korea Investment Corporation \nMalaysia   Khazanah \nNew Zealand   New Zealand Superannuation Fund \nRussia Federation  Oil Stabilization Fund \nSingapore   Government Investment Corporation \n   Temasek \nTimor-Leste   Petroleum Fund \nViet Nam  State Capital Investment Corporation \nMost  SWFs  are  professionally  invested  to  earn  good  market  returns  that  exceed  the \nearnings on official international reserves, which usually are invested in very safe, low return \nassets. SWFs are typically granted wide latitude in making investments, including in equities. \nAlthough most SWF  investments  are in foreign countries, investments within the home \ncountry or within a region are also common. Investments at home can be made for national \nstrategic development purposes; for example, the Libyan SWF directly makes domestic \ninfrastructure  investments  (IWG  2008).  As  noted  previously,  the  appropriate  investment \nstrategy can differ depending on the type of SWF funding, the associated liability, and the \npublic policy goals of the SWF.  \nThe  GAPP  makes  it  clear  that  there  is  great  diversity  in  SWF  investment  strategies. \nDomestic investments are made by some SWFs, and some SWFs may address social, \nenvironmental, or other factors in their investment policy. Whenever investments are made \non such grounds, the GAPP recommend that the policies should be publicly disclosed (IWG \n2008).  \nInfrastructure projects appear to fit the investment profile of many SWFs because of their \nsize,  long-term  tenor, competitive  returns, ability  to  diversify  portfolios  with  cyclically  or \nfinancial  market  uncorrelated  investments,  and  because  they  often  have  investment \nguarantees.  Moreover,  the  current  turmoil  in  global  financial  markets  may  shrink  other \ninvestment opportunities and increase the competitiveness of infrastructure investments.  \nAlso,  a  point  made  strongly  in  the  GAPP  is  that  investment  strategies  must  respect \nmacroeconomic and macro financial limitations; they must not contribute to overheating of \nthe  domestic  economy  or  contradiction  of  sterilization,  exchange  rate,  or  capital  flows \npolicies. SWF activities can affect domestic fiscal and monetary conditions and therefore \nshould fit within a country\u2019s overall macroeconomic policy framework and coordinated with \ndomestic authorities. Several of the Asian SWFs have activities that involve exchanges \nbetween domestic and foreign currencies, which may affect monetary conditions, exchange \n25 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \nrates, and domestic demand and that must be subjected to regular macroeconomic policy \noversight as national macroeconomic or financial policies would be affected.28 \nCurrently available information about the activities and governance of SWFs is still limited, \nbut  has  improved  in  recent  years.  SWFs  that  implement  the  GAPP  would  provide \nsubstantially more information, reporting in line with host country or international standards \nand improving both internal and external reporting, and such SWFs would provide regulatory \nand statistical information for use in macroeconomic accounts. \nSeveral prominent SWFs have made public statements regarding their goals and policies. \nThey  clearly  seek  to  assure  the  public  and  officials  in  host  countries  that  investment \ndecisions have been based on commercial considerations only and that there should be no \nfear of political or other motivations. Overwhelmingly, the investment goals are to produce \nlong-term gains, competitive with market returns or better. Two SWFs pay regular dividends \nto the government, two invest in accordance with guidance from their governments on the \ntypes  or  allocations  of  investments  and  the  situation  with  the  others  in  each  case  is \nuncertain.  \nThe information in these statements provides some clues about how SWFs may respond \nregarding possible investments in infrastructure. Overall, using SWFs to induce substantial \ninvestment in infrastructure is challenging because this type of investment is still unfamiliar \nto most SWFs and their investment managers. It does not fit into a seeming preference for \nmore arms-length investment, and may not generate the higher returns that SWFs are \nseeking. However, the long run tenor of infrastructure investment and the opportunity to \ndiversify and hedge cyclical exposures may make it an attractive investment for some SWFs. \nInvestments  packaged  with  exchange  rate  or  traffic  guarantees  could  be  especially \ninteresting for SWFs. \nSWFs could become a regular source of funding for infrastructure within the home country \nand within the region, but because of the limited information about them and the diverse \nobjectives of SWFs, it is hard to be specific about under what conditions and how much they \nwould be willing to invest in infrastructure projects.29 Although there are major uncertainties, \na strategy for drawing on their resources for infrastructure investment is proposed below.  \nFirst,  planning  for  infrastructure  development  should  involve  a  serious  commitment  to \nattempt to tap SWFs to support Asian cross-border infrastructure investment. This type of \ncommitment should be initiated early in the project planning process and should involve \nSWFs within the affected region and outreach by organizations such as ADB to SWFs in \nother Asian countries or in the Middle-East. This early interaction with SWFs will allow \ncustomization of financial packages to fit the preferences of SWFs. Also, the strong profit \nmotivation of SWFs will require that infrastructure investment proposals provide market \nreturns or better. Attracting investment by SWFs may require extension of enhancements or \nguarantees by governments, development banks, etc. to ensure that investments are secure \nand profitable.  \nSWFs often are expected to invest to support national strategic economic development \npriorities, so it could be argued that infrastructure investment is a natural area of investment \nthat supports the strategic development strategies for the country. SWFs could adopt a \nstrategy to create mixed and hedged portfolios, along the lines of commercial practice, of \nwhich part will be in long-term infrastructure investments. Here, a target of 10% investment \n                                                 \n28 By extension, regional, cross-border, or international investments by SWFs can also have macroeconomic \nramifications on the host countries that need to be considered by the host country or by regional authorities. \n29 For purposes of how SWFs could support infrastructure finance, precise definitions of the type of SWF are not \nneeded. Various types of large state funds exist, with different legal standings and purposes. Any of them could \nbe potential investors in infrastructure and thus it is not necessary for this purpose to draw precise distinctions \nbetween  the  types  of  funds.  For  other  purposes,  taxation  or  prudential  supervision  for  example,  precise \ndefinitions will be needed.  \n26 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \nin  Asian  infrastructure  is  suggested. 30  Equity  investment  by  SWFs  could  also  be \nencouraged, especially when the pattern of returns is uncertain or cannot be easily valued. \nEquity investments would be well suited to situations where the returns on the infrastructure \nhave social or welfare benefits, such as educational or health benefits. \nFinally, a portion of SWF funds should be used as official development assistance (ODA), \nalthough  tapping  SWFs  set  up  as  pension  funds  for  ODA  may  be  inappropriate.  ODA \ncontributions by SWFs are not explicitly mentioned in the GAPP, but the GAPP recognizes \nthat social or environmental factors could be taken into consideration in lending. For ODA, a \ntarget of 1% is suggested.31 This contribution recognizes that SWFs are official institutions \nsubject to national policy priorities, and one strategy could be to focus any development aid \ninto areas of financial market development and technical capacity in the financial sector. In \nIslamic finance, there is a zakat32 obligation for those that can afford it to provide a portion of \nearnings (2.5%) to the poor. The earnings of SWFs of Islamic states could be sources of \nzakat as ODA to those in need. Very roughly, annually this might equal about 0.1 to 0.2% of \nSWF asset holdings. To take an arbitrary example, this could amount to US$20 to US$40 \nmillion annually from Malaysia\u2019s Khazanah Fund. \nOn 2 April 2008, the World Bank proposed the \u201cone-percent solution\u201d, that SWFs invest 1% \nof their nearly US$3 trillion assets in Africa, or about US$30 billion (Mufson 2008). The \nproposal stressed equity investment. This total is significantly large, but for individual SWFs, \ndoes not represent a critical risk and less than needed for prudent diversification of the \nportfolio. Following this suggestion could bring some emerging economies into the group of \nproviders of ODA.33 Alternatively, rather than make direct contributions, the SWFs might \ntransfer funds to other government agencies that specialize in aid or capacity building. \nThe receptivity of SWFs to making infrastructure investments is yet unknown. Some may be \nhesitant to take direct equity positions, but be willing to invest in securities based on the \ninfrastructure investment or take equity positions in companies making the investment. A \nhigh level inquiry into SWFs and their governments (or the proposed standing organization \nof SWFs) might help to learn more about the potential and the conditions, and solicit views \nfrom SWFs on how they might contribute to infrastructure investment in Asia. \nAn important note of caution is that the use of SWFs for infrastructure investment in the \nhome  country  or  in  other  Asian  countries  could  have  macroeconomic  or  financial \nramifications. Any SWF investment in infrastructure in the home country or elsewhere within \nAsia should be scrutinized to see that it does not contribute to overheating or contradiction of \nsterilization or other policies. One implication is that new regional oversight arrangements \nmay be needed that bring SWFs under macroeconomic surveillance as an integral part of \nthe overall macroeconomic and macrofinancial policy framework. An excellent example, \nidentified by Radhakrishnan (2008), is India where a SWF has not been created, but the \npolicy has been to channel reserves accumulations into infrastructure. In one promising, but \n                                                 \n30 Estimates of total assets of Asian SWFs are imprecise, but 10% devoted to infrastructure would be around \nUS$70 to US$100 billion. This portfolio adjustment would require several years, so the annual contribution, \nwhich might reasonably total less than US$20 billion per year, would clearly cover only a small portion of the \nannual financing gap. \n31 A 1% ODA contribution from total Asian SWF assets might yield something between US$7 billion and US$10 \nbillion annually, which is a large amount. It could be a direct contribution, but could also be leveraged into more \ninvestment if it enhances private lending. ODA provided by SWFs could be used in many ways, but one \ninteresting option is to use it to provide enhancements to financial instruments issued for infrastructure \nprojects, including instruments purchased by the SWF itself. Enhancements can include exchange rate \nguarantees,  credit  guarantees,  coverage  for  grace  periods,  subordinated  capital  contributions,  traffic \nguarantees, etc.  \n32 Zakat is essentially a wealth tax. For more information, see Sulaiman (2003). \n33 For example, World Bank President Zoellick said that government-sponsored funds could invest equity in \ndevelopment, which would allow emerging countries to join the 185-nation development lender's aid program, \nthrough the support of their SWFs. Such contributions would avoid allegations sometimes made that bilateral \naid is politically motivated (Mufson 2008).  \n27 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \nstill relatively small, program (US$5 billion), India Infrastructure Finance Co. Ltd. set up an \noffshore  subsidiary  in  London  that  can  borrow  reserves  and  lend  them  on  to  Indian \ninfrastructure companies to meet their capital expenditure solely outside India. The main \ncondition is that such financing should not lead to any domestic absorption of liquidity. \nFinally, two initiatives could serve as models for infrastructure investment that may apply to \nSWFs. Asia can create an Asian SWF dedicated to infrastructure development out of excess \ninternational reserve assets. Many state-owned enterprises in major Asian countries have \nbeen witnessing high savings and profit. Asian countries can also form national infrastructure \nfunds based on the contribution of a portion of the excess profit of major state-owned \nenterprises.   \n4.4.3. Mobilizing Funds from Islamic Financial Markets \nIslamic finance has a distinctly different form than conventional finance\u2014no interest, no fixed \nreturns, sharing of risk, prohibition of certain types of investment, and obligation to contribute \nto the poor, among others.34 It is a growing field, but practices still vary and are unsettled, \naffected by differing interpretations of Islamic financial law. In many ways, it increasingly \nemulates the results of financing with conventional instruments, but sometimes with difficulty \nor inefficiency. While there are cases of blurring with conventional instruments, it remains \nlargely separate from conventional finance.  \nZeti Akhtar Aziz, the governor of Bank Negara Malaysia (Malaysia\u2019s central bank), has \nargued that Islamic financing will be critical to the future development of infrastructure in \nAsia. At the London Sukuk Summit in June 2007, she mentioned that the global sukuk \nmarket is estimated to be US$18 billion and these funds could be utilized to increase liquidity \nin the Islamic world. The Islamic bond market has typically been 10 to 20 basis points lower \nthan  mainstream  bonds,  but  more  multilateral  agencies  are  issuing  sukuks  to  finance \ndevelopment projects and government agencies and the corporate sector have considered \ndoing the same (Aziz 2007). \nOne major issue facing the prospect of utilizing Islamic finance for infrastructure investment \nis the shortfall of basic banking and savings instruments for Islamic populations. Many of the \nmore than one billion Moslems in Asia have no, or limited, access to modern financial \ninstruments. In some cases, Moslems may need to use conventional banks and instruments, \nbut compensate through actions such as donating interest earnings as zakat contributions to \nthe poor. The lack of basic banking facilities imposes major hardships on this population \nsegment,  which  is  denied  the  means  to  save  and  transact.  Development  of  Islamic \ninstruments  to  serve  basic  individual  and  community  financial  needs  and  effectively \ndelivering them to the target population would have two important impacts. First, it would \ncontribute to poverty alleviation for a very large population and, second, it would mobilize the \nsavings  of  a  very  large  population  in  ways  that  might  help  support  infrastructure \ndevelopment. By taking action on increasing access to basic, Islamic financial services, over \ntime a new pool of Islamic investment funds could be developed.35 \nAnother major issue in Islamic finance for infrastructure investment involves bonds and \nequity participation. Markets for Islamic bonds and equity participation exist, called sukuk, \nwhich are based on principles of sharing of the profit or loss of investment projects. Kuala \nLumpur and Dubai are currently the most active markets, but there is some activity in other \nAsian markets as well. Islamic bond and equity participation instruments are naturally suited \nfor project finance and their potential should be explored through consultations early on in \n                                                 \n34 For  information  on  the  background  and  characteristics  of  Islamic  finance,  and  prospects  for  its  future \ndevelopment, please refer to ISDB/IFSB (2005). \n35 Noibi (2008) of the Islamic Development Bank has said that Takaful instruments, which are a form of collective \ninsurance, seem to be an appropriate means to gather funds within Islamic communities and provide financial \nprotection for the individual contributors. Also, Ibrahim (2008) has said that injunctions to fight poverty are \npressure to move Islamic finance to adopt microfinance programs.  \n28 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \nthe project development process so that the financing plan can be tailored to the specific \nrequirements of Islamic finance. \nProspects for using Islamic bonds to support infrastructure funding are also limited because \nof difficulties in constructing long-term instruments that are not specifically tied to sharing of \nincome or loss on specific projects, which is not in the nature of many types of infrastructure \nprojects, and because of lack of standardization of instruments because of unharmonized \nShari\u2019a  (Islamic  law)  interpretations,  which  acts  to  segment  the  market  and  prevent \ndevelopment of market signals that can help direct the flow of funding into high priority \ninfrastructure projects. The Islamic Financial Services Board\u2019s \u201cTen Year Framework and \nStrategies\u201d states that harmonization of Shari\u2019a interpretations and effective legal interaction \nwith  conventional  finance  will  play  an  important  role  in  fostering  greater  growth  of  the \nindustry (ISDB/IFSB 2005). This is obviously a specialized topic related to infrastructure \nfinance,  but  mobilizing  Asian  savings  and  directing  them  to  Asian  and  subregional \ninfrastructure development will need to address how to involve the large Moslem community.  \nWorking  with  the  Islamic  Development  Bank  (IsDB),  which  channels  donations  for \ninvestment in infrastructure among other things, is another way that Islamic financing could \nbe used for Asian infrastructure projects. Projects should consider how IsDB programs might \nlink to ADB or other regional infrastructure initiatives, or how the IsDB programs might \nevolve to provide more support for infrastructure. In the past few years, the IsDB has begun \nissuing sukuk bonds in international capital markets, which opens the potential for future \nissuing of bonds focused on infrastructure development (Gulfnews 2005). In September \n2008, the IsDB and ADB signed a co-financing agreement in which both institutions stated \nthat they would collaborate on projects in common member countries.36 Each will contribute \nUS$2 billion from 2009 to 2012 for a range of projects, including infrastructure projects. The \nagreement also opens new avenues to promote infrastructure investment by third party \nfunds and through private sector participation (Gulfnews 2008). \nSignificant funds for infrastructure investment should be available through Islamic bond and \nequity markets in Kuala Lumpur and the Middle East. This requires that consultations begin \nduring  the  planning  stages  of  infrastructure  projects  on  how  to  configure  the  financial \npackage to meet Shari\u2019a requirements and to appeal to Islamic investors. Also, currently \neach project requires customization to meet Islamic requirements, but work is underway to \ncreate standardized documentation. This will greatly facilitate the process. ADB could create \na small working group on Islamic Finance for Infrastructure to work primarily with the Islamic \nFinancial Services Board in Kuala Lumpur and the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) in \nJeddah to promote this standardization and explore the potential for expanding  Islamic \nfinancing.  The  recent  announcement  of  collaboration  between  the  ADB  and  IsDB  is  a \npromising step in the right direction. \n4.4.4. Public-Private Partnerships (PPP)  \nIt is expected that the bulk of financing for new physical infrastructure (greenfield projects) \nand maintenance or upgrading of existing infrastructure (brownfield) projects will come from \nthe public sector, ODA, or multilateral development banks, but the private sector also can \ncontribute substantial amounts, up to perhaps 30% of total investment needs. For example, \nfor the estimated investment in India, as mentioned above, the private sector is expected to \ncontribute around 30% (about US$150 billion) of the total infrastructure spending, whereas \nthe federal government will invest a further 37.2% and provincial governments will cover the \nremaining 32.8%.  \nPPPs are required not only for funding, but also for technology and efficiency in the project \nimplementation. In order to attract private sector funds, Asian governments need to create \n                                                 \n36 Countries include: Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Maldives, \nPakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. \n29 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \ngood business environments and find ways to manage potential projects risks that cannot be \naddressed  by  the  private  sector.  PPP  projects  could  be  undertaken  through  various \nmodalities, such as joint ventures, concessions, management contracts, BOO (Build Own \nOperate), BOT (Build Operate and Transfer), BOOT (Build Own Operate Transfer), and \nBOLT (Build Own Lease Transfer)37.  \nOne of the major weaknesses of Asian developing countries is their level of skills and \ncapacities in handling PPP projects, particularly in their procurement and service delivery. At \nthe same time, the private sector should consider PPP infrastructure projects as a new \nmarket  opportunity.  They  need  to  gather  market  intelligence  and  conduct  appropriate \ntechnical  analysis  to  evaluate  and  prepare  bankable  or  commercially  viable  projects  in \ndeveloping countries. At present, there exists a significant information asymmetry between \nthe public and private sector regarding infrastructure development. Further details on the \npotential  for  PPP  options  are  discussed  in  another  paper  prepared  for  the  ADB/ADBI \nFlagship Study by van der Geest and Nunez-Ferrer (2010).  \n4.4.5. Asian Infrastructure Currency Unit Based Bond (AICU) \nThe lengthy implementation of infrastructure projects exposes borrowers and lenders to \nsubstantial currency risk, which is one of the major risks for financing regional projects. This \ncalls for financing schemes that can minimize exchange rate risk. One way to minimize \nexchange  rate  risk  would  be  to  create  an  Asian  Infrastructure  Currency  Unit  (AICU) \nconsisting of major Asian and non-Asian advanced economies\u2019 currencies. An AICU is \nsimply an accounting device for use in valuing infrastructure investments and repayment \nobligations  that  equals  some  weighted  measure  of  Asia  and  non-Asian  currencies.  An \ninfrastructure  AICU  bond  will  have  reduced  exchange  rate  risk  for  Asian  lenders  and \nborrowing countries based on de facto relative stability between Asian currencies.38 The \nAICU could be a precursor to the type of parallel currency described by Agarwala (2008), but \nit lacks many of the features of a true currency as it is basically just an accounting device. \nThe weights may depend on factors such as GDP, international reserves, trade or any other \nappropriate variable of those selected economies. A weighting scheme that uses the basket \nof  currencies  used  for  infrastructure  investment  itself  merits  consideration.  Total \ninfrastructure currency demand in Asia could be estimated, providing a measure of value \nrelated to the costs and benefits of the infrastructure projects. Investors would gain access to \ninvestment instruments using a standard measure of value that has muted exchange rate \nrisk; borrowers would be able to raise funds that have value related to projects\u2019 costs that \nwould also have the feature of muted exchange rate risk. One variant of this weighting \nscheme  includes  only  the  weights  of  currencies  estimated  needed  for  infrastructure \ninvestment in Asia (or in a subregion such as ASEAN). A second variant adds the currency \nrequirements for official funding of cross-border initiatives in Asia, such as funding of a \ndevelopment bank. In the second case, countries would pay their official obligations in AICU, \ngiving it a natural initial market.  \nEurope  created  a  similar  valuation  scheme  that  evolved  over  time,  beginning  with  the \nEuropean Unit of Account (EUA) and changing into the European Currency Unit (ECU) in \n1979, which ultimately became a real currency, the euro. The EUA was established as a \n\u201cclosed\u201d basket of fixed quantities of the nine EEC currencies. In contrast, the ECU was \nintended  to  be  revised  every  5  years.  The  ECU  was  initially  a  virtual  currency,  with \nsettlements made in other \u201creal\u201d currencies. Subsequently settlements were made in ECU. \nThe synthetic ECU currency unit was also used for denomination of bonds, including private \nsector  bonds.  Many  Asian  countries  cannot  issue  bonds  denominated  in  their  own \ncurrencies, but if AICU is established, they could issue AICU bonds. This would diversify \n                                                 \n37 For more details on PPP modalities, please refer to Finlayson (2008) and van der Geest and Nunez-Ferrer \n(2010). . \n38 Should Asian countries collaborate in the future to enhance policy coordination to make the exchange rates \nbetween countries more stable, the exchange rate risk of the AICU would be further reduced. \n30 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \ntheir  risk  by  not  issuing  bonds  in  one  international  currency  but  in  a  basket  of  Asian \ncurrencies (Castell et al. 2007). Creating a virtual unit such as the AICU should involve \nsurveillance of the participating currencies by a regional entity because changes in any \ncurrency in the basket affects the weighted average value and could force fellow participants \nin the scheme to make adjustments as a result of poor policy of another member. Thus, \neach  currency  should  be  obligated  to  bear  the  burden  of  macroeconomic  surveillance \nbecause all currencies are affected by the actions of each individual currency (this oversight \n39\nfeature is in line with the proposed Asian Monetary Fund (AMF)  or Asian Surveillance \n40\nUnit  model, in which a transnational oversight entity is created. \nIt would be useful to create an institution for managing regional infrastructure financing \nbonds (or build such capability into existing institutions). Countries participating in a regional \nproject could raise funds through AICU denominated bonds, which would minimize the risk \nof repayment for any individual country. The entity might also include arrangements to \nguarantee AICU-denominated bonds issued by public entities, or provide insurance for a fee \nto private issuers.  \n5.  FRAMEWORKS TO SUPPORT FINANCIAL MARKET \nDEVELOPMENT AND INTEGRATION IN ASIA \nIn addition to specific programs that promote infrastructure finance, efforts should also be \nmade to enhance and harmonize the legal, institutional, and governance frameworks in ways \nthat support cross-border investment and contribute to the general stability and effectiveness \nof financial markets. The experience of Europe highlights the very important roles, albeit \nindirect, that building harmonized frameworks had on the effectiveness of financial markets. \nSimilar steps in Asia can contribute to making effective use of Asia\u2019s savings to support its \nown infrastructure investment and development. \n5.1  Harmonization of Financial Practice and Infrastructure \nThe experience in Europe strongly emphasizes the importance of creating an overarching \nframework of comparable practices, infrastructure, and codes affecting the financial sector. \nThe ability of an economy to attract investment is seen as depending on creating a stable \nenvironment in which investments are secure, macroeconomic risks are minimized, and \ncompetitive conditions result in unbiased market signals that attract investments. Financial \nmarket distortions can arise from many sources, and the Europeans have methodically \nattempted to increase harmonization between countries as a necessary part of creating a \nunified financial system for Europe. Areas of potential harmonization include bankruptcy \ncodes, licensing, financial accounting, dispute resolution, provisioning and recognition of \nimpairment, taxation, capital adequacy and other supervisory requirements, disclosures, and \nincome repatriation, among others. Asia should systematically review where infrastructure, \nstandards,  and  practices  hinder  equal  treatment  of  cross-border  investments  or  create \nfrictions in cross-border flows. Coordinated efforts in Asia should be taken to introduce \nharmonized practices and in some ways this process is already underway as countries \nimplement international standards and best practices. These efforts should be strengthened \nand accelerated (including providing significant technical assistance to poorer economies), \nbecause they offer\u2014in addition to their other benefits\u2014ways to strengthen the effectiveness \nof financial markets. The improvements will enhance the general investment atmosphere in \nAsia, and help in infrastructure financing.  \n                                                 \n39 See Rajan (2000) for more details on this proposal. \n40 See ADB (2009c) for more details. \n31 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \nAs mentioned, the impediments to regional integration are both non-financial and financial in \nnature. In Asia, work on dismantling non-financial barriers seems to be progressing steadily, \nas  can  be  seen  from  Soesastro\u2019s  (2007)  discussion  on  how  the  ASEAN  Economic \nCommunity (AEC) Blueprint focuses on integration of trade and infrastructure and supporting \ninstitutions and policies. Progress is also being made on the financial side, especially by \nASEAN working groups, but it appears that this effort could be intensified.  \n5.2  Regional Mechanisms for Macroeconomic Oversight \nMacroeconomic  stability  is  important  in  reducing  risk  that  can  hinder  infrastructure \ninvestment.  Poorly  designed  macroeconomic  policies  can  make  investments  in  specific \ncountries unattractive and can result in recessions, high inflation, volatile exchange rates, \netc. Good macroeconomic policy making is thus a precondition for infrastructure investment. \nAlso, cross-border investment would benefit from coordinated macroeconomic oversight to \npromote macroeconomic stability in all affected countries, and to coordinate in areas such as \ndefending a configuration of exchange rates. A strong macroeconomic oversight and policy \ndevelopment apparatus is needed\u2014the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI) was a movement in the \nright direction, but it has faltered in this regard\u2014and the type of structured oversight and \nconsultation offered by an institution such as an AMF should be seriously considered.  \nThe Chiang Mai framework includes a provision for \u201cEconomic Review and Policy Dialogue\u201d \nat regular intervals at the minister and deputy levels to work towards prevention of financial \ncrises and swift taking of remedial actions. Recently, there has been increased discussion \nabout strengthening the CMI, including raising the size of potential rescue packages and \nstrengthening the oversight function to build a credible system in ASEAN+3 to monitor the \neconomic and financial situation of member countries. Such a strengthening of CMI would \nfurther its functions for effective Asian macroeconomic oversight. ASEAN+3 countries have \nagreed to set up an ASEAN+3 Surveillance Unit in Singapore (ASEAN 2009). This is a \nstrong step towards building an AMF. \nBolstering macroeconomic stability will require dealing with the cluster of related issues \nassociated with the large accumulation of reserves, exchange rates (external and between \nAsian countries), inflation control, monetary sterilization, stability of inward and outward \ncapital  flows,  and  sovereign  wealth  funds.  These  have  become  regional  issues  and  a \nregional oversight and policy development entity should be created to handle them. Such a \nregional entity or institute could also function to determine how the large accumulation of \nreserves and SWF assets could be channeled into investment in Asia. \n5.3  Regional Mechanisms for Financial Stability Oversight \nA  similar  line  of  argument  applies  to  financial  stability.  A  strong  banking  system,  well-\nfunctioning securities markets, reliable payments systems, etc., all supervised by effective \nregulators, are needed to maintain financial stability. A coordinated effort by financial sector \nregulators is called for to create stable financial conditions that can bolster infrastructure \ninvestment  flows.  Creating  an  Asian  equivalent  to  the  Financial  Stability  Board  now \nembodied in the proposal for an Asian Financial Stability Dialogue (AFSD) by ADB President \nKuroda is recommended to facilitate this coordinated effort. Among tasks for the AFSD \nwould be to identify and promote high quality standards and practices throughout Asia, \nsupport development of mechanisms for cooperation between national supervisors (in all \nfinancial subsectors), and address issues related to crisis management and lender of last \nresort  situations  (ADB  2008c).  The  AFSD  should  also  take  steps  to  ensure  that  rapid \nchanges in financial markets associated with the globalization of finance or integration of \nregional markets do not introduce new risks to financial soundness. Finally, the current \nturmoil in international financial markets provides a sharp warning to all Asian countries that \npreventive steps to avoid financial distress in Asia are an extremely high priority, and that \n32 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \nthere is an urgent need for an institution such as the AFSD to address threats to Asian \nfinancial systems.  \n5.4  Final Thoughts: Global Financial Crisis as a spur to Asian \nIntegration \nThe financing of national and regional infrastructure in Asia for increased connectivity and \nintegration should be viewed in the context of the ongoing global financial and economic \ncrisis and the rebalancing of the global financial system, including its governance and the \nbuilding of a sustainable, integrated, resilient, and balanced Asia. The severity and global \nnature  of  the  crisis  has  forced  many  changes\u2014among  them  is  a  new  view  that  the \nmacroeconomic policies being followed in Asia were components of global imbalances that \nneed to be redressed. One piece of the rebalancing is that Asia must become more inward \noriented so that more of its savings shift from short-term investment in external markets \ntoward regional long-term productive investments, of which infrastructure investment is ideal. \nProviding appropriate market infrastructure (investment tools, integrated markets, innovative \nand cost effective financing options, clearing operations, good cooperation and coordination \nframeworks, sound rules and regulations, stable internal and external macroeconomic and \nmacroprudential  conditions,  and  business  environments  conducive  to  private  sector \nparticipation, among others) would bolster the development of efficient and secure markets \nin  which  long-term,  cross-border  infrastructure  investment  could  thrive.  All  this \nsimultaneously would help create rebalanced, resilient markets that could be part of the \nsolution to the crisis. This would facilitate Asia\u2019s move toward rebalanced growth, with less \ndependence  on  exports  to  advanced  economies,  increased  intraregional  trade,  and \nincreased regional demand and consumption.  \nThe development and integration of Asian financial markets could serve twin goals. It could \nenhance  Asian  integration  through  enhanced  regional  connectivity \u2014 financing  the \ndevelopment and implementation regional infrastructure projects\u2014which would have high \npay-offs  for  all  participating  countries.  At  the  same  time,  Asian  financial  and  technical \nresources could be effectively mobilized and allocated to meet the large investment needs in \nproductive sectors like infrastructure \nBoth the prevention and management of crises and the building of regional infrastructure \nrequire a high degree of cooperation and partnership between countries so that increasingly \ncommon solutions can be offered and policy and technical friction between countries can be \nminimized. Regional efforts, such as the CMI or the renewed commitment to the ABMI, are \npointing  a  way,  as  are  various  calls  to  create  regional  macroprudential  or  financial \ncooperation entities. Efforts are becoming more cooperative\u2014at this point most are multi-\ncountry in nature, but over time some elements may become more supranational\u2014and a \nprocess  of  integration  of  aims  and  methods  is  underway,  spurred  both  by  technical \nadvantages and by the financial crisis. Regional infrastructure investment and development \nfor seamless Asian connectivity is both a beneficiary of, and contributor to, this evolution. \n33 ", "ADBI Working Paper 229    Bhattacharyay \n \nREFERENCES \nAgarwala, R. 2005.
