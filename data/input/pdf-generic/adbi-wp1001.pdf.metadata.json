Hashimoto \n \n1.  INTRODUCTION \nEven though access to sanitation facilities has improved in the urban areas of many \nAsian developing countries, the pollution of public water bodies remains a serious \nproblem. One of the causes of water pollution is improper decentralized wastewater \nmanagement. Most urban residents in Asian developing countries use septic tanks, \nmany  of  which  are  improperly  installed,  sometimes  making  them  inaccessible  for \ndesludging.  Although  sludge  management  is  essential  for  any  kind  of  wastewater \ntreatment, the type of desludging for septic tanks in developing countries is mostly  \n\u201con-call,\u201d which is not reliable. Regular desludging is the first step for decentralized \nwastewater management, which is good not only for household septic tanks but also for \npackaged aerated wastewater treatment plants (PAWTPs, or johkasou in Japanese) or \nsimilar facilities already widely used by non-household users (commercial buildings) in \nAsian developing countries. The proper treatment and disposal of the collected sludge \nis also essential. However, the development of sludge treatment facilities is far behind \nthat of sewerage systems in developing countries. \nThis is in contrast with Japan, where more than 1,000 night soil treatment facilities were \nbuilt in the 1950s and 1960s, prior to the nationwide development of sewerage systems \nthat started in the 1970s. The incidence of waterborne diseases in Japan was virtually \neliminated by 1970. This was attributed to the rapid diffusion of both piped water supply \nsystems and night soil treatment facilities. In the 1960s and 1970s, an older PAWTP \ntype, which treated only black water, was diffused widely among citizens who wanted to \ninstall  flush  toilets  as  a  symbol  of  modern  life  but  did  not  want  to  wait  \nfor sewerage system development. From the 1980s, however, the pollution of public \nwater bodies caused by untreated domestic wastewater became highly visible and was \nattributed to delays in sewerage system development and to the poor performance of the \nold-type  PAWTPs,  which  released  untreated  gray  water  into  the  environment.  \nTo  improve  the  situation,  sewerage  system  development  was  accelerated,  a  new  \ntype of PAWTP that could treat both black and gray water was developed, and a \ncomprehensive reform of decentralized wastewater management was introduced, with \nthe promulgation of the PAWTP Act (Johkasou Act) in 1983. Under the act, the legal \nbasis for manufacturing, installing, maintaining, inspecting, and cleaning (desludging) \nPAWTPs became clearly defined. To translate these measures, the act specified the \nresponsibilities and duties of users, the central government, municipalities, PAWTP \noperators, inspectors, desludging businesses, and training institutions. Accordingly,  \na system of state certifications for installation workers and maintenance operators  \nwas created. \nThe management of decentralized wastewater treatment facilities had been a neglected \nissue in Asian developing countries until 10 years ago. Recently, its importance has been \nrecognized, and in a few countries and cities, namely India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the \nPhilippines,  Hai  Phong  City  (Viet  Nam),  and  Manila  City  (the  Philippines),  sludge \nmanagement for septic tanks is being strengthened. But the problems of unregulated or \ntoo few desludging operators persist in many Asian developing countries (see Araral \n[2010]). The performance of unregulated desludging vendors is poor, and there are many \nreports of the illegal disposal of sludge into rivers. Improper operation and maintenance \nof  the  decentralized  wastewater  treatment  systems  (also  known  as  DEWATS)  of \ncommercial buildings due to the lack of human resources is another issue to be urgently \naddressed. \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1001  K. Hashimoto \n \nThis study explains the evolution of Japan\u2019s decentralized wastewater management \nsystem and extracts elements that may be useful in developing countries, including those \nthat use technology other than PAWTPs. These elements are the following: \n1.  the  establishment  of  a  qualification  and  training  system  for  decentralized \nwastewater treatment facility installation businesses;  \n2.  the introduction of a regular desludging system;  \n3.  the  establishment  of  a  qualification  and  training  system  for  desludging \nbusiness/workers; and \n4.  the establishment of a qualification and examination system for operators of \nPAWTPs or similar facilities mainly targeted for non-household users. \nThe  establishment  of  these  systems  would  not  consume  excessive  government \nresources but would require substantial administrative work. Political support would  \nbe essential, since establishing them would affect the relationships between citizens, \nadministration,  and  sanitation  workers.  The  reward  for  such  efforts  would  be  \nbetter  decentralized  wastewater  management  systems  and  the  creation  of  job \nopportunities, which are badly needed in developing countries. In Japan, nearly 200,000 \nprofessionals are working for the betterment of decentralized wastewater management \nsystems. \n2.  CURRENT SITUATION OF DECENTRALIZED \nWASTEWATER MANAGEMENT IN THE URBAN \nAREAS OF ASIAN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES \n2.1  Water Pollution Caused by Improper Decentralized \nWastewater Management \nWater Pollution in Asian Developing Countries \nWhile industrial economies in Asia have improved their public water bodies in recent \nyears, most Asian developing countries have not, and some have experienced a severe \ndeterioration. In Indonesia, 70%\u201380% of the major rivers are seriously polluted (Water \nEnvironment Partnership in Asia 2018). \nImprovement of Access to Sanitation Facilities Does Not Mean Improvement  \nof the Aquatic Environment \nThe pollution of public water bodies is serious, particularly in the urban areas of Asian \ndeveloping countries, where the coverage of centralized wastewater treatment systems \nremains low (see Araral and Wu [2016]). Although the percentage of residents in Jakarta \nwith access to improved sanitation facilities has reached 87% (2% to sewer systems, \n85% to septic tanks), the rivers in the city, in which the average biochemical oxygen \ndemand (BOD) level is 61 milligrams per liter (mg/l), have become natural sewers (Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency [JICA] 2012). Similar situations can be seen in many \nAsian urban areas. It is apparent that the increase in access to improved sanitation \nfacilities does not necessarily lead to the improvement of the aquatic environment. \n   \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1001  K. Hashimoto \n \nImproper Decentralized Wastewater Management as a Cause of Water Pollution \nWater pollution in Asian developing countries may be attributed to: (i) the low treatment \nefficiency of septic tanks, though they are widely used as household decentralized \nwastewater  treatment  facilities;  (ii)  the  large  number  of  septic  tanks  treating  only \nwastewater from toilets (black water) but not miscellaneous wastewater (gray water), \nwhich contains a higher pollution load and is discharged without treatment; or (iii) the \nimproper  management  of  the  sludge  generated  in  household  septic  tanks  and  in  \nnon-household individual wastewater treatment plants. \n2.2  Prevailing Decentralized Wastewater Treatment Systems \nwith Poor or Variable Performances \nPoor Effluent Water Quality of Septic Tanks \nInformation on the effluent water quality of septic tanks, which are widely diffused in \nAsian developing countries, is limited. However, JICA\u2019s water quality testing of septic \ntanks in Jakarta indicates that their average effluent water quality is poor (BOD of  \n200  mg/l,  chemical  oxygen  demand  of  530  mg/l)  (JICA  2012).  There  are  similar  \ntesting data for Viet Nam (Ha Noi) (Harada et al. 2008) and India (Kazumi 2014) that \nprovide similar figures. We can consider that because of the current lack of sludge \nmanagement  with  regular  desludging  systems,  even  the  inherently  insufficient \nperformance standards of septic tanks are not being achieved. \nLimitation of Anaerobic Decentralized Wastewater Treatment Systems \nIn a few countries, improved versions of anaerobic-type wastewater treatment facilities, \nsuch as BORDA\u2019s DEWATS, have been introduced. Although the effluent quality of these \nfacilities has been improved to some extent from that of septic tanks, they do not comply \nwith the new and recently revised water quality standards of the countries where they \nhave been installed. For example, the effluent water quality of DEWATS installed under \ncommunity-based sanitation programs (known as SANIMAS) in Indonesia has a BOD of \napproximately 50 mg/l, total suspended solids of 40 mg/l, and ammonia (NH -N) of 50\u2013\n4\n60  mg/l,  which  met  the  standards  of  Indonesia  at  the  time  \nof  installation  (2011),  but  not  those  of  neighboring  countries  (the  Philippines  and \nMalaysia) (Kerstens et al. 2012). It is not possible to meet Indonesia\u2019s new effluent water \nquality standard, which was revised in 2016 to a BOD of 30 mg/l, total suspended solids \nof 30 mg/l, and ammonia of 10 mg/l.  \n2.3  Improper Installation of Decentralized Wastewater \nTreatment Systems, Such as Septic Tanks, which are \nSometimes Inaccessible for Desludging Operations \nInappropriate Installation of Existing Septic Tanks \nMany septic tanks in old houses in Jakarta were installed underneath the floor in areas \nsuch as the kitchen without access covers, seemingly without any consideration for \ndesludging. In some cases, since the elevation of the house floor against the road \nsurface is not sufficient, it is difficult to discharge the septic tank effluent into the street \ndrain, meaning it is inevitably discharged underground, causing groundwater pollution. \nSimilarly, septic tanks installed inside without access covers for desludging can be \ngenerally seen in many Southeast Asian countries other than Indonesia. In Hai Phong \nCity in Viet Nam, it is reported that plastic covers are being installed on access holes by \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1001  K. Hashimoto \n \nworkers of the Drainage Corporation (the desludging entity) after septage removal \n(Water Environment Partnership in Asia 2013).  \nPoints of Attention for the Installation of Decentralized Wastewater  \nTreatment Facilities \nDecentralized wastewater treatment facilities must be installed in a way that is accessible \nfor maintenance, including desludging. Piping to connect them to toilets and street drains \nmust be conducted properly. The elevation of the installation site is also important so \nthat the effluent can be discharged to the street drain by gravity.  \nNecessary Regulatory Framework for the Appropriate Installation  \nof Decentralized Wastewater Treatment Facilities \nIn some newly built houses in Jakarta, the septic tank is installed outside the house and \nfacing  the  street,  which  is  convenient  for  desludging  and  enables  the  effluent  to \ndischarge  into  the  street  drains.  The  city  administration  has  environmental  impact \nassessments and a building permission system that checks large buildings\u2019 wastewater \nmanagement; however, such checks are not conducted for individual houses. \nIt is essential for the decentralized wastewater treatment facility installation business to \nhave the correct knowledge on all the points of attention for the installation works, \nincluding  the  selection  of  proper  locations.  Accordingly,  technical  standards  for \ninstallation, a qualification system for the installation business, and a training system for \ninstallation workers are essential. \n2.4  Lack of Sludge Management  \nImportance of Sludge Management in Decentralized Wastewater Management \nAny wastewater treatment facility, regardless of whether it is a septic tank, a DEWATS, \nor a PAWTP, generates sludge. Unless sludge is properly and regularly removed, its \nintended treatment performance will not be attained, and it will become a pollution source \nitself. The volume of generated sludge is larger in aerobic systems than in anaerobic \nsystems. In the United States, where 25% of the population uses a septic tank, the \nEnvironmental  Protection  Agency  recommends  sludge  pump-outs  every  \n4 years, but the final decision is left to the users (United States Environmental Protection \nAgency 1999). The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) (2010) \nindicates that in a regularly desludged system, sludge fills less than one-third of the tank. \nThe Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (EAWAG) recommends \ndesludging a septic tank every 2\u20135 years (EAWAG 2008). In Japan, desludging once a \nyear is a legal obligation for household PAWTP users. \nDesludging Currently Conducted in Developing Countries is \u201cOn-call\u201d  \nIn developing countries, preventive regular desludging has not been conducted, with only \na few exceptions. The desludging system mostly used in developing countries is \u201con-\ncall,\u201d in which household owners call vendors only in emergencies when their toilet \nbecomes unusable due to blockages caused by accumulated sludge in septic tanks that \nhave been unmaintained for long periods of time. According to the results of JICA\u2019s social \nsurvey (JICA 2012), summarized in Table 1, around 45% of Jakarta residents replied \nthat their septic tanks had never been desludged or that they did not know when their \ntanks had been desludged, while 7% replied that their tanks were desludged more than \nonce a year. It may be possible that if a septic tank is larger than the required size for \nthe number of users, it would not cause any inconvenience and blockages would not \noccur even if the tank is not desludged for over 10 years. This may be the case for higher-\n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1001  K. Hashimoto \n \nincome users who enjoy flush toilets connected to larger septic tanks. But, even in such \ncases, the septic tanks would have lost their treatment function and would spread \npollutants  long  before  blockages  happen.  In  contrast,  \nmost of the house owners who desludged more than once a year were or low- or middle-\nincome respondents. This may be explained by the fact that since their septic tanks are \nsmaller  than  the  required  size  for  the  number  of  users,  the  tanks  would  \nfill in a short time. \nTable 1: Frequency of Desludging in Jakarta, Indonesia  \nLow- Middle- High-\nIncome  Income  Income  Share of \nDesludging Frequency  Level  Level  Level  Leaders  Total \n1.

Unknown  7.8%  6.5%  4.5%  8.0%  6.7% \nSource: JICA (2012). \nCorrelation Between the Frequency of Desludging and the Water Quality  \nof Decentralized Wastewater Treatment Facilities \nAlthough there are not many actual data correlating the frequency of desludging and the \ntreated water quality of decentralized wastewater treatment facilities, a test by Harada et \nal. (2008) of Ha Noi\u2019s water quality indicates that while the pollutant removal rate of septic \ntanks desludged once a year is 71%, the removal rate of septic tanks desludged only \nonce in 10 years is 0%. \nFurthermore, testing data by Tadokoro et al. (1988) on old-type PAWTPs (treating only \nblack water) indicated that their treated water quality deteriorates quickly if they are not \ndesludged within 1 year. \nIntroduction of a Regular Desludging System  \nThe establishment of a regular desludging system for household septic tanks is the first \nstep for improved decentralized wastewater management since it sets a benchmark for \nthe regular desludging of PAWTPs or similar facilities for non-household users. The \nrealistic frequency of the regular desludging of septic tanks needs to be decided with \ncare, taking into consideration the capacity of households to pay the associated fees, \nsince desludging is very expensive. In Malaysia, the desludging frequency was set at \nevery 2 years initially, but it has since been revised to every 3 years.  \nProper Disposal of the Collected Sludge  \nIn many developing countries, municipalities do not recognize their responsibility for \nbuilding and operating sludge treatment facilities, with the result that their development \nis behind that of sewer systems. Even where facilities exist, their utilization rate remains \nlow, implying that substantial amounts of collected sludge are disposed of in rivers or \nother water bodies.  \n \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1001  K. Hashimoto \n \nFigure 1: Correlation between the Frequency of Desludging and the Treated \nWater Quality of Septic Tanks in Ha Noi, Viet Nam  \n \nSource: Harada, H. \u201cBetter Septic Tank Management: Challenges and Remarkable Effects (PPT)\u201d. \nPresentation. Kyoto University. \nOn-site Sludge Management in Asia and the Pacific \nSludge management of decentralized wastewater treatment facilities was a neglected \nissue until 10 years ago. Recently, even in developing countries, the importance of this \nissue has been recognized, and, in a few countries and cities, sludge management has \nbeen strengthened. In India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, etc., sludge \nmanagement for septic tanks has become an element of their sanitation and wastewater \nmanagement policy. For example, in Indonesia, the development of sludge treatment \ncapacity in all municipalities is included in their national 5-year development plan, and \npilot projects for regular desludging have been implemented in several cities. Meanwhile, \nin Hai Phong City and Manila City, the regular desludging of septic tanks has been \nsystematized and implemented for over 10 years. Malaysia started to tackle this issue \nmore than 20 years ago and is undergoing a trial-and-error process. Dumaguete City, in \nthe Philippines, established a regular desludging system in 2007 but reportedly returned \nto on-call desludging services in recent years (SNV 2015).  \nSeptage Management is Not an Issue Limited to the Poor \nThough septage management is often considered as an issue for the poor, Harada \nshowed how the regular desludging rate is lower for educated groups than for low/middle \neducation level groups. To introduce a regular desludging system, the most crucial factor \nis how to engage middle-to-high-income households.  \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1001  K. Hashimoto \n \n2.5  Unregulated and Insufficient Numbers of Desludging \nOperators  \nInadequate Performance of Unregulated Desludging Vendors \nEven in developing countries, there are demands for on-call desludging. Currently, they \nare rarely regulated or trained, with the result being inadequate performance. In Jakarta, \nresidents complained that private desludging vendors tend to do careless work, removing \nonly the water content of the tank and leaving the sludge, thus resulting in it becoming \nfull again very soon. There are many reports on the illegal disposal of collected sludge \ninto rivers and other water bodies to avoid disposal fees and long trips to facilities. \nImproving Desludging Vendors\u2019 Service is Essential for Effective Non-household \nIndividual Wastewater Treatment Facilities \nThe poor quality of desludging vendors is an obstacle for the improvement not only  \nof household septic tanks, but also non-household individual wastewater treatment \nfacilities.  If  vendors  conduct  desludging  works  without  proper  knowledge  of  these \nfacilities, which are far more complex and sizable than septic tanks, there is the risk not \nonly of error, but also that the equipment may be broken.  \nMeasures to Improve the Social Status of Desludging Workers is Also Essential \nOn the other hand, the social status of desludging workers in developing countries is low, \nand their income is unstable under current on-call systems. To improve DEWATS in \ndeveloping countries, measures to improve their social status are also required. \n2.6  Improper Operation and Maintenance of Decentralized \nWastewater Treatment Systems for Non-Household Users \nRecent Move Toward Tightening Regulations on Non-household Individual \nWastewater Treatment Facilities \nThe wastewater generated by non-household users, such as apartments, hotels, office \nbuildings, shopping malls, schools, hospitals, and large restaurants, etc. (collectively \ncalled commercial buildings) is generally similar to that generated by individual houses, \nalthough their volume per square meter is bigger. Therefore, in many countries, stricter \nregulation is applied to non-household users in comparison to household users. For \nexample, in Jakarta, there are 4,000 commercial buildings for which stricter effluent water \nquality standards have been applied since 2005, i.e., BOD 50 mg/l, which was revised \nto 30 mg/l in 2016, and mandatory effluent water quality testing by the municipal \nenvironment authority has been introduced since 2005. Consequently, many commercial \nbuildings  have  replaced  their  septic  tanks  with  aerobic-type  wastewater  treatment \nfacilities. Some of them are locally manufactured Japanese-type PAWTPs, while others \nare  imported  from  other  countries  such  as  Australia;  both  are  aerobic  facilities \n(collectively called \u201cPAWTPs or similar facilities\u201d). \nImproper Operation of Individual Wastewater Treatment Facilities of Commercial \nBuildings in Asian Developing Countries \nIn  Jakarta,  60%  of  non-household  PAWTPs  or  similar  facilities  were  not  properly \noperated. The majority of PAWTPs or similar facilities use activated sludge processes \nwherein, if the sludge concentration in the reactor is too high, treatment performance \ndeteriorates. Therefore, to control the density of sludge, a Mixed Liquor Suspended \nSolids monitor is required. However, there is no evidence that such control work is being \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1001  K. Hashimoto \n \nconducted. Moreover, since PAWTPs or similar facilities use aerobic processes, the \nsludge volume is large, requiring desludging at least once a year, twice a year in case of \nall aeration formula types. Nonetheless, there are facilities that have not been desludged \nsince installation (JICA 2012). \n2.7  Lack of Human Resources for Operation and Maintenance \nof Decentralized Wastewater Treatment Facilities \nOperating Wastewater Treatment Facilities from Commercial Buildings Requires \nExpert Knowledge and Experience \nFor households in developing countries, regular septic tank desludging is the only way \nto maintain their limited treatment performance. In contrast, PAWTPs or similar facilities \nused by non-household users feature numerous mechanical parts and devices that \nrequire expert knowledge and experience for proper maintenance. Since such human \nresources are lacking, a system to develop them is required. Once such systems are \nestablished, PAWTPs or similar advanced facilities will become usable for households \nin the future. \n2.8  Lack, or Underutilization, of Sludge Treatment Capacity \nNecessity to Increase the Capacity of On-site Sludge Treatment \nIn order to ensure efficient operations from desludging operators (a desludging vehicle \ncan cover a multiple number of septic tanks or PAWTPs in a day), treatment facilities \nneed to be conveniently located (for example, within 30 minutes\u2019 drive). In Japan, for \nexample, about 1,000 treatment facilities were built nationwide. Kumagaya City, a typical \nmid-size city with a population of 200,000 and an area of 160 km2, has two treatment \nfacilities. It should be noted that in developing countries, if the distance to the treatment \nfacility is too large, desludging operators will dispose of the collected sludge in nearby \npublic water bodies. \nIn Developing Countries, Sludge Treatment Capacity is Inadequate \nIn developing countries, sludge treatment capacity is far behind that of the sewerage \nsystems. For example, 10 years ago in India, there were no sludge treatment facilities. \nIndonesia is an exceptional case; in some cities, there are existing sludge treatment \nfacilities, but some are currently not operating. In Jakarta, there are two sludge treatment \nfacilities, both of which are operating, but their utilization is limited. The reason for this \nmay be due to the low coverage of the regular desludging program and the operators \ndisposing the sludge into public water bodies.  \nProblems of Sludge Treatment Facilities Recently Built in Developing Countries \nRecently, a few developing countries have strengthened sludge treatment capacity in \nline with their policy for improving sludge management for septic tanks. For example, the \nMinistry of Public Works in Indonesia has established a target to build sludge treatment \nfacilities in all 700 municipalities. As a result, new treatment facilities have been built in \na few municipalities and the two existing facilities in Jakarta have been renovated. \nSludge from septic tanks and PAWTPs or similar facilities contain a lot of water, and the \nbasic treatment principles are: i) solid/liquid separation; ii) disposal of solid (dried sludge) \nby landfill, incineration, composting or reuse as building materials or other measures; \nand iii) wastewater treatment of the supernatant. These principles are not much different \nfrom the principles for treatment and disposal of the excess sludge generated in the \nWastewater Treatment Plant. But the on-site sludge has two distinct features; it contains \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1001  K. Hashimoto \n \nmore  sand  and  screen  residues  than  in  the  usual  wastewater  and  has  a  less \nhomogeneous nature due to its being collected from various sources. For example, in \nJapan,  not  only  the  sludge  collected  from  PAWTPs  but  \nalso night soil collected from vault toilets, is brought to sludge treatment facilities. \nBecause  of  these  features,  the  pre-treatment  process,  in  which  sand  and  screen \nresidues are removed and sludge from various sources is stored and agitated before the \nsolid-liquid separation, is important. The \u201cpre-treatment\u201d of many newly built sludge \ntreatment facilities in developing countries is not properly designed, resulting in their poor \nperformances. \n3.  JAPAN\u2019S DECENTRALIZED WASTEWATER \nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM \n3.1  Evolution of Decentralized Wastewater Management  \nin Japan \nAchievements in Sanitation: Night Soil Treatment (1950\u20131960s)  \nIn Japan, vault toilets, which have a water-tight structure and functioned as a temporary \nstorage for night soil, were the most popular historical style of toilet. The night soil stored \nin the vault toilets in urban houses in Japan was collected and transported to rural areas \nand used as fertilizer for agricultural production. This night soil recycling mechanism was \nestablished well before World War II. \nDuring the rapid economic growth starting from the late 1950s, the traditional night soil \nrecycling systems broke up due to urbanization and the spread of chemical fertilizers, \nand night soil turned from fertilizer to waste. Meanwhile, sanitary treatment of the \nincreasing night soil in major cities resulted in a serious social problem. To cope with \nthis, municipalities carried out the treatment of night soil and promoted the development \nof advanced night soil treatment technologies. \nIn 1953, the government launched a subsidy program for the construction of night soil \ntreatment facilities. As a result, more than 1,100 night soil treatment facilities were built \nnationwide before the development of sewer systems, which started in the mid-1970s.  \nIn Japan, water-borne diseases (cholera, shigellosis, typhoid) were almost completely \neliminated by 1970. This was attributed to the rapid diffusion of both piped water supply \nsystems and the night soil treatment facilities (Ministry of Environment of Japan 2013). \nAchievements in Sanitation: The Spread of Flush Toilets (1970s) \nDuring the rapid economic growth starting from the late 1950s, a housing boom occurred, \nand the demand for flush toilets was high. On the other hand, sewer system development \nhad  just  started  and  could  not  connect  to  every  household.  In  order  \nto meet the desire for plumbing of those who were unlikely to be connected to the sewer \nin  the  near  future,  PAWTP  technology  was  developed,  which  could  be  used  \nfor flush toilets in 1950s and 1960s. PAWTPs became a prominent 1970s measure  \nfor the dissemination of flush toilets and sanitation improvement, together with the sewer \nsystem.  \n   \n9 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1001  K. Hashimoto \n \nPAWTPs at the time treated only black water (herein after referred to as \u201cthe PAWTP \nblack water only-type\u201d). Entering the 1970s, however, the development of small-scale \nPAWTPs, which treat both black water and gray water, was undertaken. \nFrom Sanitation to Wastewater Management Based on the PAWTP  \n(1980s to the Present) \nFrom the early 1980s, the pollution of public water bodies caused by untreated domestic \nwastewater, e.g., eutrophication, became highly visible, particularly in closed water \nareas. Although legal regulations were already established, the effects of the measures \nfor  domestic  wastewater  did  not  become  apparent  at  the  time  because  of  \nthe delay of the development of public sewerage systems. Especially in areas where the \nPAWTP black water only-type prevailed, pollution problems in public water bodies was \nattributed to untreated domestic wastewater (gray water), and improper installation \nand/or maintenance of the PAWTP black water only-type. \nIn 1983, the Johkasou Law (hereafter referred to as \u201cthe PAWTP Law\u201d) was enacted to \novercome this situation. In Japan, such laws are usually drafted by the ministry in charge \nand presented to the parliament. In the case of the PAWTP Law, however, since its \ncontents would affect multiple ministries and no single ministry would write the draft, it \nwas  drafted  by  the  parliamentarians  supported  by  the  stakeholders  of  Japan\u2019s \ndecentralized  wastewater  management  system,  such  as  the  PAWTP  maintenance \nvendors and desludging operators who deemed it vital for their business. With this law, \nthe legal basis for the installation of manufactured PAWTPs, and their maintenance, \ninspection,  and  desludging  became  clearly  defined.  To  securely  translate  these \nmeasures into reality, the responsibility and duties of PAWTP users were specified and \nstate certification systems were established for both PAWTP installation workers and \nmaintenance operators (Sasaki 2003).  \nIn order to promote the use of PAWTPs that treat both black and gray water, when \nindividuals install them, this facility can be subsidized through a system established \nnationwide. When the municipalities themselves install the PAWTP in the individuals\u2019 \npremises as municipal property across their administrated areas, a special subsidy \nsystem was launched by the central government in 1998 with the aim of promoting \nmunicipalities\u2019 initiatives. The PAWTP Law was amended in 2000 to eliminate the  \nblack  water  only-type  and  make  implementation  compulsory  when  newly  installing  \nsuch facilities. \n3.2  How Does It Work? \nPrevention of the Water Pollution Caused by Improper Decentralized  \nWastewater Management \nIn Japan, while centralized sewer systems are expected to play a central role for the \nclean-up of rivers and other public water bodies, decentralized systems, which cover \nareas where sewer installation is not planned in the near future, are expected to play  \na supplemental role. However, even when there is no choice other than installing \ndecentralized systems, the structural standards, manufacturing, installation, operation \nand maintenance, including desludging, of these systems are strictly regulated by the \nPAWTP Law.  \n   \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1001  K. Hashimoto \n \nEnsure Good Performance of Decentralized Wastewater Treatment Plants \nIn Japan, decentralized wastewater treatment plants are standardized. Legally, the \nPAWTP  is  the  only  standard  decentralized  wastewater  treatment  plant  in  Japan.  \nA  corporate  body  that  intends  to  manufacture  PAWTPs  must  receive  government \napproval, which is issued when these proposed plants meets the prescribed design \nstandard. If a manufacturer intends to manufacture a new, non-standardized type of \nPAWTP, it must be tested by a designated institution. \nEnsure Proper Installation of Decentralized Wastewater Treatment Plants \nIn Japan, those building a new house or building must submit a certification application \nprior to the start of construction to the municipality and seek confirmation by the district \nconstruction surveyor deployed by the municipality. Usually, this application is made by \nthe house building company on behalf of the house owner. To the building certification \napplication, the type of PAWTP to be installed, together with a copy of the government \napproval letter, must be attached. If these are satisfactory, the district construction \nsurveyor issues a building permit.  \nPAWTP installation businesses are subject to registration with the prefectural governor \nthat has jurisdiction over the area where they intend to conduct business, and they must \nassign an installation worker certified by the Japan Education Center for Environmental \nSanitation in each place of business. \nEnsure Proper Sludge Management, Indispensable for Decentralized  \nWastewater Management \nAs mentioned previously, the owner or user of a PAWTP installed in a house or building \nis, under the PAWTP Law, designated as the \u201cPAWTP (Johkasou) Manager\u201d. The Law \nmandates these managers to desludge their PAWTP once a year, work that can be \nentrusted to a PAWTP Desludging Vendor. \nRegulate Desludging Vendors to Ensure Proper Operations while Providing Job \nOpportunities and Social Status  \nAll the PAWTP desludging businesses in Japan need to obtain the approval of the local \nmayor. This approval may be for a limited period and is issued if the desludging \nequipment and the applicant capability conform to the standards prescribed by the \nMinistry of the Environment (MOE). The applicant must also show no record of violating \nthe PAWTP Law during the 2 years preceding the application.  \nIn order to protect the desludging workers from the anticipated unemployment because \nof the diffusion of sewerage systems, municipalities are obligated to support their  \njob transfer according to the Act on Special Measures Concerning Streamlining of \nDomestic Waste Disposal Business incidental to Improvement of Sewerage (1975). \nEnsure Proper Operation and Maintenance of Decentralized Wastewater \nTreatment Systems for Commercial Buildings \nThe PAWTP Law requires adherence to the maintenance frequency specified by the \nMOE, which is once every 4 months for small-scale PAWTPs (e.g., a household type), \nand more frequently for medium- and large-scale PAWTPs, according to the type of \ntreatment process. For example, in case of activated sludge treatment processes, the \nrequired frequency is once a week, while for the contact aeration process with screen \nand flow equalization chambers or flow equalization tanks, the required frequency is \nevery two weeks. \n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1001  K. Hashimoto \n \nPAWTP  managers  must  deploy  qualified  supervisors  when  the  user  population \nequivalent exceeds 500, and may entrust operation and maintenance (O&M) to a \nregistered vendor. The PAWTP Maintenance Vendors are required to use certified \nPAWTP Operators in order to engage them in the O&M of these facilities. PAWTP \nmanagers must also ensure that their PAWTP receives the inspection of the newly \ninstalled PAWTP and an annual inspection for water quality (or the number of times \ndesignated  by  the  MOE)  by  the  Specified  Inspection  Agency  designated  by  the \nprefectural governor. If it is found that O&M and/or desludging is not done properly, an \nimprovement order will be issued to the O&M vendor and/or to the desludging vendor. \nThe PAWTP manager may be ordered to stop using PAWTP for the period of 10 days or \nless, if required. \nLack of Human Resources for Operation and Maintenance of Decentralized \nWastewater Treatment Facilities \nIn order to secure the number of technicians required for the decentralized wastewater \nmanagement, the Japan Education Center for Environmental Sanitation (JECES) was \nestablished to provide training for professionals in the businesses related to PAWTP in \n1966. The following includes details on the certification process for PAWTP workers and \noperators. \nIn 1983, the Johkasou (PAWTP) Act was established, which stipulated that only the \nqualified vendors and/or workers can engage in the installation, O&M, and desludging of \nPAWTPs. In 1984 and 1985, national examinations for PAWTP Operators and PAWTP \nInstallation Workers started. JECES was appointed as the agency for training courses \nand the agency for the examinations by the PAWTP Act. As for PAWTP Desludging \nTechnicians, although training and national examination are not legally mandatory, since \nthe desludging vendor is subject to the approval of a municipality, many municipalities \ngive  approval  on  the  condition  that  the  applying  desludging  \nvendor employs desludging technicians who hold the completion certificate of JECES\u2019s \ntraining course. Therefore, in reality, only trained professionals can engage in desludging \nworks.  \nThrough  the  examinations  and  the  training  courses,  more  than  3,000  PAWTP \ntechnicians  join  PAWTP  businesses  every  year.  As  of  31  March  2016,  213,732 \ntechnicians were registered as shown in the Table 2. \nTable 2: Numbers of Certified Technicians Engaged in the Management  \nof the Decentralized Wastewater Treatment System in Japan \nNumber of \nCertified Technicians  Registrants  Business Content  Legal Basis \nPAWTP operators  80,042  Operation and maintenance  PAWTP Act \nPAWTP installation workers  86,595  Installation/construction \nPAWTP technical supervisor  29,794  Management of PAWTP with  Ordinance of \n501 PE or more  PAWTP Act \nPAWTP desludging technicians  16,021  Desludging \nRegistered PAWTP inspectors  1,280  PAWTP inspection and water \nquality examination \nTotal  213,732     \nSource: Ministry of Energy, Japan, \u201cNight Soil Treatment and Decentralized Wastewater Treatment Systems in Japan\u201d. \n12 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1001  K. Hashimoto \n \n3.2.1  Activities of the Goto Group  \nThe Goto Group was established in 1963 and is a private company engaged in the \nmaintenance and desludging business of PAWTPs in Kumagaya City, Saitama. The \ncompany started its operation with the cleaning of vault toilets and the desludging of \nPAWTPs, and expanded its operations to the PAWTP maintenance business. The \ncompany currently employs 43 staff, 16 of whom hold the certificate of PAWTP operator. \nA further two hold the certificate of PAWTP installation worker and 14 hold the completion \ncertificate of the PAWTP desludging technician training course. \nThe maintenance of a household-type PAWTP is performed by a single operator and \ntakes 15 minutes. Households pay \\4,000/work/house as a fee. In Kumagaya City, the \nfrequency  is  four  times  a  year,  one  more  than  the  mandated  minimum.  After \nmaintenance, a checklist is handed over to the household and shared. A PAWTP \noperator may cover 12 units per day.  \nThe desludging of a household PAWTP is also performed by a single technician taking \n15  minutes/house  (excluding  the  time  for  transportation).  The  desludging  fee  is \n\\11,000/m3, equivalent to \\17,000 for a typical PAWTP for household, the size of which \nis 1.5 m3. The required frequency of desludging works is once a year. A desludging \ntechnician may cover six units per day. \nThe service life of the blower for a household PAWTP is about 10 years, if replacement \nof the failed component is done properly, which costs about \\8,000 each time. The blower \nis exchanged with a new one every 10 years, which costs \\50,000/unit. These costs are \npaid by the household.  \nThe Goto Group provides maintenance and desludging services not only for household-\ntype PAWTPs, but also for mid-size and large PAWTPs installed for buildings and \nhousing complexes. The company has a group of specialists for the maintenance of mid- \nand large-size PAWTPs. Maintenance of a mid-size PAWTP installed in a housing \ncomplex is also performed by a single operator taking 1.5\u20132 hours. Operators that cover \nsix buildings/complexes per day meet their target. \nAs an example, the Goto Group received a contract from the Saitama Prefectural \nGovernment for the maintenance and desludging of a mid-size PAWTP installed in a \nhousing complex (about 300 residents) with a capacity of 60 m3/day. The annual contract \nis \\2.1 million. The treatment process of this PAWTP is the contact aeration type, with a \nrequired  maintenance  frequency  of  every  2  weeks.  But,  in  accordance  with  the \ninstruction of the prefectural government, maintenance is performed once a week. This \nhousing complex was built in the 1960s\u20131970s. Accordingly, the PAWTP is considered \nto have been operating for more than 40 years, but maintains good effluent water quality \nof BOD 20mg/l or less. \nThis PAWTP is not only subject to the legal inspection (once a year), but is also subject \nto a spot check by the prefectural government under the Water Pollution Prevention Act, \nwhich regulates all the wastewater treatment facilities whose capacity is 50 m3/day or \nmore. Therefore, there is no room to pull out. (Notice of spot check will be given 2 weeks \nin advance. It is impossible to recover the performance of this size PAWTP within 2 \nweeks if it has not been taken care of properly.) \nSecure Sufficient Sludge Treatment Capacity \nAs stated before, during the 1950s and 1960s, many night soil treatment facilities were \nconstructed  throughout  the  country  by  local  governments.  Since  the  diffusion  of \nPAWTPs, the same facilities are operated as sludge treatment facilities.  \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1001  K. Hashimoto \n \n3.3  Elements of Japan\u2019s Decentralized Wastewater \nManagement System Useful for Wastewater Management  \nin Developing Countries \nEffluent Water Quality Standards and Selection of Decentralized Wastewater \nManagement System \nIn order to achieve good effluent water quality, introducing the aerobic-type PAWTP or \na similar facility as a decentralized wastewater treatment facility would be required. \nHowever, it would increase the capital and operating expenditure, which would exceed \nthe ability of household users to pay, making it difficult to introduce a uniform regulation \nin  developing  countries.  Therefore,  it  would  be  a  realistic  policy  response  for \ngovernments,  on  the  one  hand,  to  allow  the  currently  prevailing  anaerobic-type \nwastewater treatment facilities, under the condition that their maintenance, including \nsludge management, is substantially improved. On the other hand, conversion to the \naerobic  PAWTP  or  a  similar  facility  should  be  promoted  for  non-household  users  \nand high-income households if sewer connection is difficult. Accordingly, regulations \nconcerning domestic wastewater, such as the effluent water quality standards, should \nbe  different  according  to  the  type  of  user.  Otherwise,  such  effluent  water  quality \nstandards would end up as a mere target, not the standards which are actually imposed \nto regulate polluters based on the established value, as is currently the case in many \ndeveloping countries. \nQualification and Training System for Installation Business of Decentralized \nWastewater Treatment Facilities \nImproving the decentralized wastewater management would mandate that, when a new \nhouse or building is to be built, a municipal construction surveyor checks the facility  \nin the process of issuing building permits, as is the case in Japan. But, the building \npermits  system  works  only  if  the  decentralized  wastewater  treatment  facilities  are \nstandardized by the performance testing system. In developing counties, however, as \nmentioned earlier, the standardization of decentralized wastewater treatment facilities, \nparticularly those for household users, would be difficult at this moment. Therefore,  \nit  would  be  a  realistic  policy  response  that,  while  the  government  allows  diverse \ndecentralized wastewater treatment facilities, particularly those for household use, it \ntakes measures to ensure the quality of installation of these various facilities via a \nqualification and training system modeled on that used in Japan. \nIntroducing Regular Desludging System for Decentralized Wastewater  \nTreatment Facilities \nMany countries issue manuals for maintenance of septic tanks, which indicates their \nrecommended desludging frequency. In many cases, the decision on the timing of \ndesludging is left to the users. As a consequence, in reality, the desludging of septic \ntanks is conducted only when some troubles such as a blockage happen. If that is  \nthe case, the septic tanks would have lost their treatment function, thus spreading \npollutants prior to the blockage happening. Therefore, it is essential to establish a \nregulatory framework in which the timing of the desludging is not left to the users. In \nJapan, the desludging of PAWTPs is a legal obligation for the users, established as once \na  year,  with  the  timing  controlled  by  the  desludging  businesses  approved  by  \nthe municipalities. \n \n14 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1001  K. Hashimoto \n \nIt is not clear whether a Japan-type system would work in developing countries, since \nthe high cost of desludging (US$30\u2013$100/unit in Asian developing countries) would \nbecome an obstacle. In both Manila City and Hai Phong City, the regular desludging of \nseptic tanks, which has been implemented in a relatively organized manner city-wide for \nover a decade, is the obligation of the utility (sewer operator) and its cost is recovered \nby an add-up to the water bill (20% of the water bill in both cities) and by the wide \ncollection from all the household and non-household customers. As the water charge \ncontains a cross-subsidy from non-household users to household users, a similar knock-\non effect occurs with the desludging fee. In this way, the average desludging intervals of \n5\u20137 years in Manila City and 4 years in Hai Phong City are achieved. This is a different \napproach than Japan, but it may fit the actual situation of developing countries. \nQualification System and Training System for Desludging Business and Workers \nIn Manila City and Hai Phong City, desludging works are performed by water and \nwastewater operators or sewer and drainage corporations. In many countries, including \nJapan, however, desludging works of on-site facilities such as septic tanks and PAWTPs \nare  performed  by  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises.  Some  of  these  are  micro \nenterprises, a few of which belong to the informal sector, as also used to be the case in \nJapan. Consequently, their performance is poor, and they end up conducting illegal \nactivities such as dumping the collected sludge into rivers. \nIn order to improve this, it would be effective for the government to establish a training \nsystem for desludging technicians, and a system in which only the desludging vendors \nwho employ the properly trained technicians are allowed to engage in desludging \nbusiness so that the authority can regulate them, cultivate their professionalism, and \nraise their social position. \nQualification System and Examination System for Operators of PAWTPs  \nor Similar Facilities for Non-household Users \nThough qualifications such as those for engineers or graduates from an engineering \nuniversity are not necessary, it is desirable that technicians for PAWTPs or similar \nfacilities attend a professional training course and pass an official examination, and it \nwould thus be good policy for developing nations to ensure such a system monitors skill \nlevels. As practiced in Japan, if the cost of the training and of the examination is paid by \nthe trainees or the companies for which they work, they would become more serious and \nthe sustainability of the training/examination system would be secured. \nIn  addition,  the  penalty  on  the  non-household  users  who  fail  to  engage  qualified \noperators for their PAWTP or similar facility must be strengthened.  \nDevelopment of Proper Sludge Treatment Facilities \nIn many developing countries, the development of on-site sludge treatment facilities trails \nthe  development  of  sewer  systems.  For  these  countries  to  improve  decentralized \nwastewater  management,  its  development  must  be  accelerated.  In  reality,  some  \nrecent  facilities  built  in  developing  countries  are  not  operating  properly  due  to \ninappropriate design. \nJapan  has  a  60-year  history  of  developing  sludge  treatment  facilities.  More  than  \n1,000 facilities were built nationwide, and while Japan\u2019s sophisticated technologies may \nnot be suitable for developing countries, the accumulated knowledge and experiences \non the basic process of on-site sludge treatment, pretreatment, solid-liquid separation, \ndisposal of dried sludge, treatment of supernatant (wastewater treatment) would be \nuseful for developing countries and should be shared internationally. \n15 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1001  K. Hashimoto \n \nAmong the above-mentioned measures, the establishment of qualifications, training, and \nan  examination  system  for  installation  workers,  desludging  business/workers  \nand operators of PAWTPs or similar facilities would consume few government resources. \nHowever, these would require political will since copious administrative work is required \nand relationships between citizens, administrations, and sanitation workers need to be \naugmented.  The  1983  PAWTP  Law  was  achieved  by  politicians  backed  \nby sanitation workers. Similar efforts would create better decentralized wastewater \nmanagement systems and the creation of work opportunities, which are badly needed in \ndeveloping countries. In Japan, 200,000 professionals are working for the betterment of \ndecentralized wastewater management systems. \n   \n16 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1001  K.
