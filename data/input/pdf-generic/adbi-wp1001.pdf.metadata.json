INTRODUCTION \n\nK. Hashimoto \n\nEven  though  access  to  sanitation  facilities  has  improved  in  the  urban  areas  of  many \nAsian  developing  countries,  the  pollution  of  public  water  bodies  remains  a  serious \nproblem.  One  of  the  causes  of  water  pollution  is  improper  decentralized  wastewater \nmanagement.  Most  urban  residents  in  Asian  developing  countries  use  septic  tanks, \nmany  of  which  are  improperly  installed,  sometimes  making  them  inaccessible  for \ndesludging.  Although  sludge  management  is  essential  for  any  kind  of  wastewater \ntreatment,  the  type  of  desludging  for  septic  tanks  in  developing  countries  is  mostly  \n\u201con-call,\u201d  which  is  not  reliable.  Regular  desludging  is  the  first  step  for  decentralized \nwastewater management, which is good not only for household septic tanks but also for \npackaged aerated wastewater treatment plants (PAWTPs, or johkasou in Japanese) or \nsimilar facilities already widely used by non-household users (commercial buildings) in \nAsian developing countries. The proper treatment and disposal of the collected sludge \nis also essential. However, the development of sludge treatment facilities is far behind \nthat of sewerage systems in developing countries. \n\nflush \n\nlife  but  did  not  want \n\ntoilets  as  a  symbol  of  modern \n\nThis is in contrast with Japan, where more than 1,000 night soil treatment facilities were \nbuilt in the 1950s and 1960s, prior to the nationwide development of sewerage systems \nthat started in the 1970s. The incidence of waterborne diseases in Japan was virtually \neliminated by 1970. This was attributed to the rapid diffusion of both piped water supply \nsystems  and  night  soil  treatment  facilities.  In  the  1960s  and  1970s,  an  older  PAWTP \ntype, which treated only black water, was diffused widely among citizens who wanted to \ninstall \nto  wait  \nfor  sewerage  system  development.  From  the  1980s,  however,  the  pollution  of  public \nwater bodies caused by untreated domestic wastewater became highly visible and was \nattributed to delays in sewerage system development and to the poor performance of the \nold-type  PAWTPs,  which  released  untreated  gray  water  into  the  environment.  \nTo  improve  the  situation,  sewerage  system  development  was  accelerated,  a  new  \ntype  of  PAWTP  that  could  treat  both  black  and  gray  water  was  developed,  and  a \ncomprehensive reform of decentralized wastewater management was introduced, with \nthe  promulgation  of  the  PAWTP  Act  (Johkasou Act)  in  1983.  Under  the  act,  the  legal \nbasis  for  manufacturing,  installing,  maintaining,  inspecting,  and  cleaning  (desludging) \nPAWTPs  became  clearly  defined.  To  translate  these  measures,  the  act  specified  the \nresponsibilities  and  duties  of  users,  the  central  government,  municipalities,  PAWTP \noperators,  inspectors,  desludging  businesses,  and  training  institutions.  Accordingly,  \na  system  of  state  certifications  for  installation  workers  and  maintenance  operators  \nwas created. \n\nThe management of decentralized wastewater treatment facilities had been a neglected \nissue in Asian developing countries until 10 years ago. Recently, its importance has been \nrecognized,  and  in  a  few  countries  and  cities,  namely  India,  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  the \nPhilippines,  Hai  Phong  City  (Viet  Nam),  and  Manila  City  (the  Philippines),  sludge \nmanagement for septic tanks is being strengthened. But the problems of unregulated or \ntoo  few  desludging  operators  persist  in  many  Asian  developing  countries  (see  Araral \n[2010]). The performance of unregulated desludging vendors is poor, and there are many \nreports of the illegal disposal of sludge into rivers. Improper operation and maintenance \nof  the  decentralized  wastewater  treatment  systems  (also  known  as  DEWATS)  of \ncommercial buildings due to the lack of human resources is another issue to be urgently \naddressed. \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1001 \n \n\nK. Hashimoto \n\nThis  study  explains  the  evolution  of  Japan\u2019s  decentralized  wastewater  management \nsystem and extracts elements that may be useful in developing countries, including those \nthat use technology other than PAWTPs. These elements are the following: \n\n1.  the  establishment  of  a  qualification  and  training  system  for  decentralized \n\nwastewater treatment facility installation businesses;  \n\n2.  the introduction of a regular desludging system;  \n\n3.  the  establishment  of  a  qualification  and  training  system  for  desludging \n\nbusiness/workers; and \n\n4.  the  establishment  of  a  qualification  and  examination  system  for  operators  of \n\nPAWTPs or similar facilities mainly targeted for non-household users. \n\nThe  establishment  of  these  systems  would  not  consume  excessive  government \nresources  but  would  require  substantial  administrative  work.  Political  support  would  \nbe  essential,  since  establishing  them  would  affect  the  relationships  between  citizens, \nadministration,  and  sanitation  workers.  The  reward  for  such  efforts  would  be  \nbetter  decentralized  wastewater  management  systems  and  the  creation  of  job \nopportunities, which are badly needed in developing countries. In Japan, nearly 200,000 \nprofessionals are working for the betterment of decentralized wastewater management \nsystems. \n\n2.  CURRENT SITUATION OF DECENTRALIZED \n\nWASTEWATER MANAGEMENT IN THE URBAN \nAREAS OF ASIAN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES \n\n2.1  Water Pollution Caused by Improper Decentralized \n\nWastewater Management \n\nWater Pollution in Asian Developing Countries \n\nWhile  industrial  economies  in  Asia  have  improved  their  public  water  bodies  in  recent \nyears, most Asian developing countries have not, and some have experienced a severe \ndeterioration. In Indonesia, 70%\u201380% of the major rivers are seriously polluted (Water \nEnvironment Partnership in Asia 2018). \n\nImprovement of Access to Sanitation Facilities Does Not Mean Improvement  \nof the Aquatic Environment \n\nThe pollution of public water bodies is serious, particularly in the urban areas of Asian \ndeveloping countries, where the coverage of centralized wastewater treatment systems \nremains low (see Araral and Wu [2016]). Although the percentage of residents in Jakarta \nwith access to improved sanitation facilities has reached 87% (2% to  sewer systems, \n85%  to  septic  tanks),  the  rivers  in  the  city,  in  which  the  average  biochemical  oxygen \ndemand (BOD) level is 61 milligrams per liter (mg/l), have become natural sewers (Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency [JICA] 2012). Similar situations can be seen in many \nAsian  urban  areas.  It  is  apparent  that  the  increase  in  access  to  improved  sanitation \nfacilities does not necessarily lead to the improvement of the aquatic environment. \n\n \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1001 \n \n\nK. Hashimoto \n\nImproper Decentralized Wastewater Management as a Cause of Water Pollution \n\nWater pollution in Asian developing countries may be attributed to: (i) the low treatment \nefficiency  of  septic  tanks,  though  they  are  widely  used  as  household  decentralized \nwastewater  treatment  facilities;  (ii)  the  large  number  of  septic  tanks  treating  only \nwastewater  from  toilets  (black  water)  but  not  miscellaneous  wastewater  (gray  water), \nwhich contains a higher pollution load and is discharged without treatment; or (iii) the \nimproper  management  of  the  sludge  generated  in  household  septic  tanks  and  in  \nnon-household individual wastewater treatment plants. \n\n2.2  Prevailing Decentralized Wastewater Treatment Systems \n\nwith Poor or Variable Performances \n\nPoor Effluent Water Quality of Septic Tanks \n\nInformation  on  the  effluent  water  quality  of  septic  tanks,  which  are  widely  diffused  in \nAsian  developing  countries,  is  limited.  However,  JICA\u2019s  water  quality  testing  of  septic \ntanks  in  Jakarta  indicates  that  their  average  effluent  water  quality  is  poor  (BOD  of  \n200  mg/l,  chemical  oxygen  demand  of  530  mg/l)  (JICA  2012).  There  are  similar  \ntesting data for Viet Nam (Ha Noi) (Harada et al. 2008) and India (Kazumi 2014) that \nprovide  similar  figures.  We  can  consider  that  because  of  the  current  lack  of  sludge \nmanagement  with  regular  desludging  systems,  even  the  inherently  insufficient \nperformance standards of septic tanks are not being achieved. \n\nLimitation of Anaerobic Decentralized Wastewater Treatment Systems \n\nIn a few countries, improved versions of anaerobic-type wastewater treatment facilities, \nsuch as BORDA\u2019s DEWATS, have been introduced. Although the effluent quality of these \nfacilities has been improved to some extent from that of septic tanks, they do not comply \nwith the new and recently revised water quality standards of the countries where they \nhave been installed. For example, the effluent water quality of DEWATS installed under \ncommunity-based sanitation programs (known as SANIMAS) in Indonesia has a BOD of \napproximately 50 mg/l, total suspended solids of 40 mg/l, and ammonia (NH4-N) of 50\u2013\n60  mg/l,  which  met \ntime  \nstandards \nof  installation  (2011),  but  not  those  of  neighboring  countries  (the  Philippines  and \nMalaysia) (Kerstens et al. 2012). It is not possible to meet Indonesia\u2019s new effluent water \nquality standard, which was revised in 2016 to a BOD of 30 mg/l, total suspended solids \nof 30 mg/l, and ammonia of 10 mg/l.  \n\nIndonesia \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\nat \n\nof \n\n2.3  Improper Installation of Decentralized Wastewater \n\nTreatment Systems, Such as Septic Tanks, which are \nSometimes Inaccessible for Desludging Operations \n\nInappropriate Installation of Existing Septic Tanks \n\nMany septic tanks in old houses in Jakarta were installed underneath the floor in areas \nsuch  as  the  kitchen  without  access  covers,  seemingly  without  any  consideration  for \ndesludging.  In  some  cases,  since  the  elevation  of  the  house  floor  against  the  road \nsurface is not sufficient, it is difficult to discharge the septic tank effluent into the street \ndrain, meaning it is inevitably discharged underground, causing groundwater pollution. \nSimilarly,  septic  tanks  installed  inside  without  access  covers  for  desludging  can  be \ngenerally seen in many Southeast Asian countries other than Indonesia. In Hai Phong \nCity in Viet Nam, it is reported that plastic covers are being installed on access holes by \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1001 \n \n\nK. Hashimoto \n\nworkers  of  the  Drainage  Corporation  (the  desludging  entity)  after  septage  removal \n(Water Environment Partnership in Asia 2013).  \n\nPoints of Attention for the Installation of Decentralized Wastewater  \nTreatment Facilities \n\nDecentralized wastewater treatment facilities must be installed in a way that is accessible \nfor maintenance, including desludging. Piping to connect them to toilets and street drains \nmust be conducted properly. The elevation of the installation site is also important so \nthat the effluent can be discharged to the street drain by gravity.  \n\nNecessary Regulatory Framework for the Appropriate Installation  \nof Decentralized Wastewater Treatment Facilities \n\nIn some newly built houses in Jakarta, the septic tank is installed outside the house and \nfacing  the  street,  which  is  convenient  for  desludging  and  enables  the  effluent  to \ndischarge  into  the  street  drains.  The  city  administration  has  environmental  impact \nassessments and a building permission system that checks large buildings\u2019 wastewater \nmanagement; however, such checks are not conducted for individual houses. \n\nIt is essential for the decentralized wastewater treatment facility installation business to \nhave  the  correct  knowledge  on  all  the  points  of  attention  for  the  installation  works, \nincluding  the  selection  of  proper  locations.  Accordingly,  technical  standards  for \ninstallation, a qualification system for the installation business, and a training system for \ninstallation workers are essential. \n\n2.4  Lack of Sludge Management  \n\nImportance of Sludge Management in Decentralized Wastewater Management \n\nAny wastewater treatment facility, regardless of whether it is a septic tank, a DEWATS, \nor  a  PAWTP,  generates  sludge.  Unless  sludge  is  properly  and  regularly  removed,  its \nintended treatment performance will not be attained, and it will become a pollution source \nitself.  The  volume  of  generated  sludge  is  larger  in  aerobic  systems  than  in  anaerobic \nsystems.  In  the  United  States,  where  25%  of  the  population  uses  a  septic  tank,  the \nEnvironmental  Protection  Agency \nevery  \n4 years, but the final decision is left to the users (United States Environmental Protection \nAgency 1999). The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) (2010) \nindicates that in a regularly desludged system, sludge fills less than one-third of the tank. \nThe Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (EAWAG) recommends \ndesludging a septic tank every 2\u20135 years (EAWAG 2008). In Japan, desludging once a \nyear is a legal obligation for household PAWTP users. \n\nrecommends \n\npump-outs \n\nsludge \n\nDesludging Currently Conducted in Developing Countries is \u201cOn-call\u201d  \n\nIn developing countries, preventive regular desludging has not been conducted, with only \na few exceptions. The desludging system mostly used in developing countries is \u201con-\ncall,\u201d  in  which  household  owners  call  vendors  only  in  emergencies  when  their  toilet \nbecomes unusable due to blockages caused by accumulated sludge in septic tanks that \nhave been unmaintained for long periods of time. According to the results of JICA\u2019s social \nsurvey (JICA 2012), summarized in Table 1, around 45% of Jakarta residents replied \nthat their septic tanks had never been desludged or that they did not know when their \ntanks had been desludged, while 7% replied that their tanks were desludged more than \nonce a year. It may be possible that if a septic tank is larger than the required size for \nthe  number  of  users,  it would  not  cause  any  inconvenience  and  blockages  would  not \noccur even if the tank is not desludged for over 10 years. This may be the case for higher-\n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1001 \n \n\nK. Hashimoto \n\nincome users who enjoy flush toilets connected to larger septic tanks. But, even in such \ncases,  the  septic  tanks  would  have  lost  their  treatment  function  and  would  spread \npollutants \ncontrast,  \nblockages \nmost of the house owners who desludged more than once a year were or low- or middle-\nincome respondents.

(2008) of Ha Noi\u2019s water quality indicates that while the pollutant removal rate of septic \ntanks desludged once a year is 71%, the removal rate of septic tanks desludged only \nonce in 10 years is 0%. \n\nFurthermore, testing data by Tadokoro et al. (1988) on old-type PAWTPs (treating only \nblack water) indicated that their treated water quality deteriorates quickly if they are not \ndesludged within 1 year. \n\nIntroduction of a Regular Desludging System  \n\nThe establishment of a regular desludging system for household septic tanks is the first \nstep for improved decentralized wastewater management since it sets a benchmark for \nthe  regular  desludging  of  PAWTPs  or  similar  facilities  for  non-household  users.  The \nrealistic  frequency  of  the  regular  desludging  of septic  tanks  needs  to  be  decided  with \ncare, taking into consideration the capacity of households to pay the associated fees, \nsince desludging is very expensive. In Malaysia, the desludging frequency was set at \nevery 2 years initially, but it has since been revised to every 3 years.  \n\nProper Disposal of the Collected Sludge  \n\nIn  many  developing  countries,  municipalities  do  not  recognize  their  responsibility  for \nbuilding and operating sludge treatment facilities, with the result that their development \nis behind that of sewer systems. Even where facilities exist, their utilization rate remains \nlow, implying that substantial amounts of collected sludge are disposed of in rivers or \nother water bodies.  \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1001 \n \n\nK. Hashimoto \n\nFigure 1: Correlation between the Frequency of Desludging and the Treated \nWater Quality of Septic Tanks in Ha Noi, Viet Nam  \n\nSource:  Harada,  H.  \u201cBetter  Septic  Tank  Management:  Challenges  and  Remarkable  Effects  (PPT)\u201d. \nPresentation. Kyoto University. \n\n \n\nOn-site Sludge Management in Asia and the Pacific \n\nSludge  management  of  decentralized  wastewater  treatment  facilities  was  a  neglected \nissue until 10 years ago. Recently, even in developing countries, the importance of this \nissue has been recognized, and, in a few countries and cities, sludge management has \nbeen  strengthened.  In  India,  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  and  the  Philippines,  etc.,  sludge \nmanagement for septic tanks has become an element of their sanitation and wastewater \nmanagement  policy.  For  example,  in  Indonesia,  the  development  of  sludge  treatment \ncapacity in all municipalities is included in their national 5-year development plan, and \npilot projects for regular desludging have been implemented in several cities. Meanwhile, \nin  Hai  Phong  City  and  Manila  City,  the  regular  desludging  of  septic  tanks  has  been \nsystematized and implemented for over 10 years. Malaysia started to tackle this issue \nmore than 20 years ago and is undergoing a trial-and-error process. Dumaguete City, in \nthe Philippines, established a regular desludging system in 2007 but reportedly returned \nto on-call desludging services in recent years (SNV 2015).  \n\nSeptage Management is Not an Issue Limited to the Poor \n\nThough  septage  management  is  often  considered  as  an  issue  for  the  poor,  Harada \nshowed how the regular desludging rate is lower for educated groups than for low/middle \neducation level groups. To introduce a regular desludging system, the most crucial factor \nis how to engage middle-to-high-income households.  \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1001 \n \n\nK. Hashimoto \n\n2.5  Unregulated and Insufficient Numbers of Desludging \n\nOperators  \n\nInadequate Performance of Unregulated Desludging Vendors \n\nEven in developing countries, there are demands for on-call desludging. Currently, they \nare rarely regulated or trained, with the result being inadequate performance. In Jakarta, \nresidents complained that private desludging vendors tend to do careless work, removing \nonly the water content of the tank and leaving the sludge, thus resulting in it becoming \nfull again very soon. There are many reports on the illegal disposal of collected sludge \ninto rivers and other water bodies to avoid disposal fees and long trips to facilities. \n\nImproving Desludging Vendors\u2019 Service is Essential for Effective Non-household \nIndividual Wastewater Treatment Facilities \n\nThe  poor  quality  of  desludging  vendors  is  an  obstacle  for  the  improvement  not  only  \nof  household  septic  tanks,  but  also  non-household  individual  wastewater  treatment \nfacilities.  If  vendors  conduct  desludging  works  without  proper  knowledge  of  these \nfacilities, which are far more complex and sizable than septic tanks, there is the risk not \nonly of error, but also that the equipment may be broken.  \n\nMeasures to Improve the Social Status of Desludging Workers is Also Essential \n\nOn the other hand, the social status of desludging workers in developing countries is low, \nand  their  income  is  unstable  under  current  on-call  systems.  To  improve  DEWATS  in \ndeveloping countries, measures to improve their social status are also required. \n\n2.6  Improper Operation and Maintenance of Decentralized \n\nWastewater Treatment Systems for Non-Household Users \n\nRecent Move Toward Tightening Regulations on Non-household Individual \nWastewater Treatment Facilities \n\nThe wastewater generated by non-household users, such as apartments, hotels, office \nbuildings,  shopping  malls,  schools,  hospitals,  and  large  restaurants,  etc.  (collectively \ncalled commercial buildings) is generally similar to that generated by individual houses, \nalthough their volume per square meter is bigger. Therefore, in many countries, stricter \nregulation  is  applied  to  non-household  users  in  comparison  to  household  users.  For \nexample, in Jakarta, there are 4,000 commercial buildings for which stricter effluent water \nquality standards have been applied since 2005, i.e., BOD 50 mg/l, which was revised \nto  30  mg/l  in  2016,  and  mandatory  effluent  water  quality  testing  by  the  municipal \nenvironment authority has been introduced since 2005. Consequently, many commercial \nbuildings  have  replaced  their  septic  tanks  with  aerobic-type  wastewater  treatment \nfacilities. Some of them are locally manufactured Japanese-type PAWTPs, while others \nare  imported  from  other  countries  such  as  Australia;  both  are  aerobic  facilities \n(collectively called \u201cPAWTPs or similar facilities\u201d). \n\nImproper Operation of Individual Wastewater Treatment Facilities of Commercial \nBuildings in Asian Developing Countries \n\nIn  Jakarta,  60%  of  non-household  PAWTPs  or  similar  facilities  were  not  properly \noperated. The majority of PAWTPs or similar facilities use activated sludge processes \nwherein,  if  the  sludge  concentration  in  the  reactor  is  too  high,  treatment  performance \ndeteriorates.  Therefore,  to  control  the  density  of  sludge,  a  Mixed  Liquor  Suspended \nSolids monitor is required. However, there is no evidence that such control work is being \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1001 \n \n\nK. Hashimoto \n\nconducted.  Moreover,  since  PAWTPs  or  similar  facilities  use  aerobic  processes,  the \nsludge volume is large, requiring desludging at least once a year, twice a year in case of \nall aeration formula types. Nonetheless, there are facilities that have not been desludged \nsince installation (JICA 2012). \n\n2.7  Lack of Human Resources for Operation and Maintenance \n\nof Decentralized Wastewater Treatment Facilities \n\nOperating Wastewater Treatment Facilities from Commercial Buildings Requires \nExpert Knowledge and Experience \n\nFor households in developing countries, regular septic tank desludging is the only way \nto maintain their limited treatment performance. In contrast, PAWTPs or similar facilities \nused  by  non-household  users  feature  numerous  mechanical  parts  and  devices  that \nrequire expert knowledge and experience for proper maintenance. Since such human \nresources are lacking, a system to develop them is required. Once such systems are \nestablished, PAWTPs or similar advanced facilities will become usable for households \nin the future. \n\n2.8  Lack, or Underutilization, of Sludge Treatment Capacity \n\nNecessity to Increase the Capacity of On-site Sludge Treatment \n\nIn order to ensure efficient operations from desludging operators (a desludging vehicle \ncan cover a multiple number of septic tanks or PAWTPs in a day), treatment facilities \nneed  to  be  conveniently  located  (for  example,  within  30  minutes\u2019  drive).  In  Japan,  for \nexample, about 1,000 treatment facilities were built nationwide. Kumagaya City, a typical \nmid-size city with a population of 200,000 and an area of 160 km2, has two treatment \nfacilities. It should be noted that in developing countries, if the distance to the treatment \nfacility is too large, desludging operators will dispose of the collected sludge in nearby \npublic water bodies. \n\nIn Developing Countries, Sludge Treatment Capacity is Inadequate \n\nIn  developing  countries,  sludge  treatment  capacity  is  far  behind  that  of  the  sewerage \nsystems. For example, 10 years ago in India, there were no sludge treatment facilities. \nIndonesia  is  an  exceptional  case;  in  some  cities,  there  are  existing  sludge  treatment \nfacilities, but some are currently not operating. In Jakarta, there are two sludge treatment \nfacilities, both of which are operating, but their utilization is limited. The reason for this \nmay be due to the low coverage of the regular desludging program and the operators \ndisposing the sludge into public water bodies.  \n\nProblems of Sludge Treatment Facilities Recently Built in Developing Countries \n\nRecently,  a  few  developing  countries  have  strengthened  sludge  treatment  capacity  in \nline with their policy for improving sludge management for septic tanks. For example, the \nMinistry of Public Works in Indonesia has established a target to build sludge treatment \nfacilities in all 700 municipalities. As a result, new treatment facilities have been built in \na  few  municipalities  and  the  two  existing  facilities  in  Jakarta  have  been  renovated. \nSludge from septic tanks and PAWTPs or similar facilities contain a lot of water, and the \nbasic treatment principles are: i) solid/liquid separation; ii) disposal of solid (dried sludge) \nby  landfill,  incineration, composting  or  reuse  as  building  materials  or  other  measures; \nand iii) wastewater treatment of the supernatant. These principles are not much different \nfrom  the  principles  for  treatment  and  disposal  of  the  excess  sludge  generated  in  the \nWastewater Treatment Plant. But the on-site sludge has two distinct features; it contains \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1001 \n \n\nK. Hashimoto \n\nthe \n\nnot \n\nonly \n\nmore  sand  and  screen  residues  than  in  the  usual  wastewater  and  has  a  less \nhomogeneous nature due to its being collected from various sources. For example, in \nJapan, \nbut  \nalso  night  soil  collected  from  vault  toilets,  is  brought  to  sludge  treatment  facilities. \nBecause  of  these  features,  the  pre-treatment  process,  in  which  sand  and  screen \nresidues are removed and sludge from various sources is stored and agitated before the \nsolid-liquid  separation,  is  important.  The  \u201cpre-treatment\u201d  of  many  newly  built  sludge \ntreatment facilities in developing countries is not properly designed, resulting in their poor \nperformances. \n\nPAWTPs \n\ncollected \n\nsludge \n\nfrom \n\n3.  JAPAN\u2019S DECENTRALIZED WASTEWATER \n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM \n\n3.1  Evolution of Decentralized Wastewater Management  \n\nin Japan \n\nAchievements in Sanitation: Night Soil Treatment (1950\u20131960s)  \n\nIn Japan, vault toilets, which have a water-tight structure and functioned as a temporary \nstorage for night soil, were the most popular historical style of toilet. The night soil stored \nin the vault toilets in urban houses in Japan was collected and transported to rural areas \nand used as fertilizer for agricultural production. This night soil recycling mechanism was \nestablished well before World War II. \n\nDuring the rapid economic growth starting from the late 1950s, the traditional night soil \nrecycling systems broke up due to urbanization and the spread of chemical fertilizers, \nand  night  soil  turned  from  fertilizer  to  waste.  Meanwhile,  sanitary  treatment  of  the \nincreasing night soil in major cities resulted in a serious social problem. To cope with \nthis, municipalities carried out the treatment of night soil and promoted the development \nof advanced night soil treatment technologies. \n\nIn 1953, the government launched a subsidy program for the construction of night soil \ntreatment facilities. As a result, more than 1,100 night soil treatment facilities were built \nnationwide before the development of sewer systems, which started in the mid-1970s.  \n\nIn Japan, water-borne diseases (cholera, shigellosis, typhoid) were almost completely \neliminated by 1970. This was attributed to the rapid diffusion of both piped water supply \nsystems and the night soil treatment facilities (Ministry of Environment of Japan 2013). \n\nAchievements in Sanitation: The Spread of Flush Toilets (1970s) \n\njust  started  and  could  not  connect \n\nDuring the rapid economic growth starting from the late 1950s, a housing boom occurred, \nand the demand for flush toilets was high. On the other hand, sewer system development \nhad \nIn  order  \nto meet the desire for plumbing of those who were unlikely to be connected to the sewer \nin  the  near  future,  PAWTP  technology  was  developed,  which  could  be  used  \nfor  flush  toilets  in  1950s  and  1960s.  PAWTPs  became  a  prominent  1970s  measure  \nfor the dissemination of flush toilets and sanitation improvement, together with the sewer \nsystem.  \n\nto  every  household. \n\n \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1001 \n \n\nK. Hashimoto \n\nPAWTPs at the time treated only black water (herein after referred to as \u201cthe PAWTP \nblack water only-type\u201d). Entering the 1970s, however, the development of small-scale \nPAWTPs, which treat both black water and gray water, was undertaken. \n\nFrom Sanitation to Wastewater Management Based on the PAWTP  \n(1980s to the Present) \n\nFrom the early 1980s, the pollution of public water bodies caused by untreated domestic \nwastewater,  e.g.,  eutrophication,  became  highly  visible,  particularly  in  closed  water \nareas. Although legal regulations were already established, the effects of the measures \nfor  domestic  wastewater  did  not  become  apparent  at \ntime  because  of  \nthe delay of the development of public sewerage systems. Especially in areas where the \nPAWTP black water only-type prevailed, pollution problems in public water bodies was \nattributed  to  untreated  domestic  wastewater  (gray  water),  and  improper  installation \nand/or maintenance of the PAWTP black water only-type. \n\nthe \n\nIn 1983, the Johkasou Law (hereafter referred to as \u201cthe PAWTP Law\u201d) was enacted to \novercome this situation. In Japan, such laws are usually drafted by the ministry in charge \nand  presented  to  the  parliament.  In  the  case  of  the  PAWTP  Law,  however,  since  its \ncontents would affect multiple ministries and no single ministry would write the draft, it \nwas  drafted  by  the  parliamentarians  supported  by  the  stakeholders  of  Japan\u2019s \ndecentralized  wastewater  management  system,  such  as  the  PAWTP  maintenance \nvendors and desludging operators who deemed it vital for their business. With this law, \nthe  legal  basis  for  the  installation  of  manufactured  PAWTPs,  and  their  maintenance, \ninspection,  and  desludging  became  clearly  defined.  To  securely  translate  these \nmeasures into reality, the responsibility and duties of PAWTP users were specified and \nstate  certification  systems  were  established  for  both  PAWTP  installation  workers  and \nmaintenance operators (Sasaki 2003).  \n\nIn  order  to  promote  the  use  of  PAWTPs  that  treat  both  black  and  gray  water,  when \nindividuals  install  them,  this  facility  can  be  subsidized  through  a  system  established \nnationwide.  When  the  municipalities  themselves  install  the  PAWTP  in  the  individuals\u2019 \npremises  as  municipal  property  across  their  administrated  areas,  a  special  subsidy \nsystem  was  launched  by  the  central  government  in  1998  with  the  aim  of  promoting \nmunicipalities\u2019  initiatives.  The  PAWTP  Law  was  amended  in  2000  to  eliminate  the  \nblack  water  only-type  and  make  implementation  compulsory  when  newly  installing  \nsuch facilities. \n\n3.2  How Does It Work? \n\nPrevention of the Water Pollution Caused by Improper Decentralized  \nWastewater Management \n\nIn  Japan,  while  centralized  sewer  systems  are  expected  to  play  a  central  role  for  the \nclean-up  of  rivers  and  other  public  water  bodies,  decentralized  systems,  which  cover \nareas where sewer installation is not planned in the near future, are expected to play  \na  supplemental  role.  However,  even  when  there  is  no  choice  other  than  installing \ndecentralized  systems,  the  structural  standards,  manufacturing,  installation,  operation \nand maintenance, including desludging, of these systems are strictly regulated by the \nPAWTP Law.  \n\n \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1001 \n \n\nK. Hashimoto \n\nEnsure Good Performance of Decentralized Wastewater Treatment Plants \n\nIn  Japan,  decentralized  wastewater  treatment  plants  are  standardized.  Legally,  the \nPAWTP  is  the  only  standard  decentralized  wastewater  treatment  plant  in  Japan.  \nA  corporate  body  that  intends  to  manufacture  PAWTPs  must  receive  government \napproval,  which  is  issued  when  these  proposed  plants  meets  the  prescribed  design \nstandard.  If  a  manufacturer  intends  to  manufacture  a  new,  non-standardized  type  of \nPAWTP, it must be tested by a designated institution. \n\nEnsure Proper Installation of Decentralized Wastewater Treatment Plants \n\nIn Japan, those building a new house or building must submit a certification application \nprior to the start of construction to the municipality and seek confirmation by the district \nconstruction surveyor deployed by the municipality. Usually, this application is made by \nthe house building company on behalf of the house owner. To the building certification \napplication, the type of PAWTP to be installed, together with a copy of the government \napproval  letter,  must  be  attached.  If  these  are  satisfactory,  the  district  construction \nsurveyor issues a building permit.  \n\nPAWTP installation businesses are subject to registration with the prefectural governor \nthat has jurisdiction over the area where they intend to conduct business, and they must \nassign an installation worker certified by the Japan Education Center for Environmental \nSanitation in each place of business. \n\nEnsure Proper Sludge Management, Indispensable for Decentralized  \nWastewater Management \n\nAs mentioned previously, the owner or user of a PAWTP installed in a house or building \nis, under the PAWTP Law, designated as the \u201cPAWTP (Johkasou) Manager\u201d. The Law \nmandates  these  managers  to  desludge  their  PAWTP  once  a  year,  work  that  can  be \nentrusted to a PAWTP Desludging Vendor. \n\nRegulate Desludging Vendors to Ensure Proper Operations while Providing Job \nOpportunities and Social Status  \n\nAll the PAWTP desludging businesses in Japan need to obtain the approval of the local \nmayor.  This  approval  may  be  for  a  limited  period  and  is  issued  if  the  desludging \nequipment  and  the  applicant  capability  conform  to  the  standards  prescribed  by  the \nMinistry of the Environment (MOE). The applicant must also show no record of violating \nthe PAWTP Law during the 2 years preceding the application.  \n\nIn order to protect the desludging workers from the anticipated unemployment because \nof  the  diffusion  of  sewerage  systems,  municipalities  are  obligated  to  support  their  \njob  transfer  according  to  the  Act  on  Special  Measures  Concerning  Streamlining  of \nDomestic Waste Disposal Business incidental to Improvement of Sewerage (1975). \n\nEnsure Proper Operation and Maintenance of Decentralized Wastewater \nTreatment Systems for Commercial Buildings \n\nThe  PAWTP  Law  requires  adherence  to  the  maintenance  frequency  specified  by  the \nMOE, which is once every 4 months for small-scale PAWTPs (e.g., a household type), \nand  more  frequently  for  medium-  and  large-scale  PAWTPs,  according  to  the  type  of \ntreatment process. For example, in case of activated sludge treatment processes, the \nrequired frequency is once a week, while for the contact aeration process with screen \nand  flow  equalization  chambers  or  flow  equalization  tanks,  the  required  frequency  is \nevery two weeks. \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1001 \n \n\nK. Hashimoto \n\nPAWTP  managers  must  deploy  qualified  supervisors  when  the  user  population \nequivalent  exceeds  500,  and  may  entrust  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  to  a \nregistered  vendor.  The  PAWTP  Maintenance  Vendors  are  required  to  use  certified \nPAWTP  Operators  in  order  to  engage  them  in  the  O&M  of  these  facilities.  PAWTP \nmanagers  must  also  ensure  that  their  PAWTP  receives  the  inspection  of  the  newly \ninstalled  PAWTP  and  an  annual  inspection  for  water  quality  (or  the  number  of  times \ndesignated  by  the  MOE)  by  the  Specified  Inspection  Agency  designated  by  the \nprefectural governor. If it is found that O&M and/or desludging is not done properly, an \nimprovement order will be issued to the O&M vendor and/or to the desludging vendor. \nThe PAWTP manager may be ordered to stop using PAWTP for the period of 10 days or \nless, if required. \n\nLack of Human Resources for Operation and Maintenance of Decentralized \nWastewater Treatment Facilities \n\nIn order to secure the number of technicians required for the decentralized wastewater \nmanagement, the Japan Education Center for Environmental Sanitation (JECES) was \nestablished to provide training for professionals in the businesses related to PAWTP in \n1966. The following includes details on the certification process for PAWTP workers and \noperators. \n\nIn  1983,  the  Johkasou  (PAWTP)  Act  was  established,  which  stipulated  that  only  the \nqualified vendors and/or workers can engage in the installation, O&M, and desludging of \nPAWTPs. In 1984 and 1985, national examinations for PAWTP Operators and PAWTP \nInstallation Workers started. JECES was appointed as the agency for training courses \nand  the  agency  for  the  examinations  by  the  PAWTP  Act.  As  for  PAWTP  Desludging \nTechnicians, although training and national examination are not legally mandatory, since \nthe desludging vendor is subject to the approval of a municipality, many municipalities \ndesludging  \ngive \nvendor employs desludging technicians who hold the completion certificate of JECES\u2019s \ntraining course. Therefore, in reality, only trained professionals can engage in desludging \nworks.  \n\ncondition \n\napproval \n\napplying \n\nthat \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\non \n\nThrough  the  examinations  and  the  training  courses,  more  than  3,000  PAWTP \ntechnicians  join  PAWTP  businesses  every  year.

Hashimoto \n\n3.2.1  Activities of the Goto Group  \n\nThe  Goto  Group  was  established  in  1963  and  is  a  private  company  engaged  in  the \nmaintenance  and  desludging  business  of  PAWTPs  in  Kumagaya  City,  Saitama.  The \ncompany  started  its  operation  with  the  cleaning  of  vault  toilets  and  the  desludging  of \nPAWTPs,  and  expanded  its  operations  to  the  PAWTP  maintenance  business.  The \ncompany currently employs 43 staff, 16 of whom hold the certificate of PAWTP operator. \nA further two hold the certificate of PAWTP installation worker and 14 hold the completion \ncertificate of the PAWTP desludging technician training course. \n\nThe maintenance of a household-type PAWTP is performed by a single operator and \ntakes 15 minutes. Households pay \\4,000/work/house as a fee. In Kumagaya City, the \nfrequency  is  four  times  a  year,  one  more  than  the  mandated  minimum.  After \nmaintenance,  a  checklist  is  handed  over  to  the  household  and  shared.  A  PAWTP \noperator may cover 12 units per day.  \n\nThe desludging of a household PAWTP is also performed by a single technician taking \n15  minutes/house  (excluding  the  time  for  transportation).  The  desludging  fee  is \n\\11,000/m3, equivalent to \\17,000 for a typical PAWTP for household, the size of which \nis  1.5  m3.  The  required  frequency  of  desludging  works  is  once  a  year.  A  desludging \ntechnician may cover six units per day. \n\nThe service life of the blower for a household PAWTP is about 10 years, if replacement \nof the failed component is done properly, which costs about \\8,000 each time. The blower \nis exchanged with a new one every 10 years, which costs \\50,000/unit. These costs are \npaid by the household.  \n\nThe Goto Group provides maintenance and desludging services not only for household-\ntype  PAWTPs,  but  also  for  mid-size  and  large  PAWTPs  installed  for  buildings  and \nhousing complexes. The company has a group of specialists for the maintenance of mid- \nand  large-size  PAWTPs.  Maintenance  of  a  mid-size  PAWTP  installed  in  a  housing \ncomplex is also performed by a single operator taking 1.5\u20132 hours. Operators that cover \nsix buildings/complexes per day meet their target. \n\nAs  an  example,  the  Goto  Group  received  a  contract  from  the  Saitama  Prefectural \nGovernment  for  the  maintenance  and  desludging  of  a  mid-size  PAWTP  installed  in  a \nhousing complex (about 300 residents) with a capacity of 60 m3/day. The annual contract \nis \\2.1 million. The treatment process of this PAWTP is the contact aeration type, with a \nrequired  maintenance  frequency  of  every  2  weeks.  But,  in  accordance  with  the \ninstruction of the prefectural government, maintenance is performed once a week. This \nhousing complex was built in the 1960s\u20131970s. Accordingly, the PAWTP is considered \nto have been operating for more than 40 years, but maintains good effluent water quality \nof BOD 20mg/l or less. \n\nThis PAWTP is not only subject to the legal inspection (once a year), but is also subject \nto a spot check by the prefectural government under the Water Pollution Prevention Act, \nwhich regulates all the wastewater treatment facilities whose capacity is 50 m3/day or \nmore. Therefore, there is no room to pull out. (Notice of spot check will be given 2 weeks \nin  advance.  It  is  impossible  to  recover  the  performance  of  this  size  PAWTP  within  2 \nweeks if it has not been taken care of properly.) \n\nSecure Sufficient Sludge Treatment Capacity \n\nAs stated before, during the 1950s and 1960s, many night soil treatment facilities were \nconstructed  throughout  the  country  by  local  governments.  Since  the  diffusion  of \nPAWTPs, the same facilities are operated as sludge treatment facilities.  \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1001 \n \n\nK. Hashimoto \n\n3.3  Elements of Japan\u2019s Decentralized Wastewater \n\nManagement System Useful for Wastewater Management  \nin Developing Countries \n\nEffluent Water Quality Standards and Selection of Decentralized Wastewater \nManagement System \n\nIn order to achieve good effluent water quality, introducing the aerobic-type PAWTP or \na  similar  facility  as  a  decentralized  wastewater  treatment  facility  would  be  required. \nHowever, it would increase the capital and operating expenditure, which would exceed \nthe ability of household users to pay, making it difficult to introduce a uniform regulation \nin  developing  countries.  Therefore,  it  would  be  a  realistic  policy  response  for \ngovernments,  on  the  one  hand,  to  allow  the  currently  prevailing  anaerobic-type \nwastewater  treatment  facilities,  under  the  condition  that  their  maintenance,  including \nsludge  management,  is  substantially  improved.  On  the  other  hand,  conversion  to  the \naerobic  PAWTP  or  a  similar  facility  should  be  promoted  for  non-household  users  \nand  high-income  households  if  sewer  connection  is  difficult.  Accordingly,  regulations \nconcerning domestic wastewater, such as the effluent water quality standards, should \nbe  different  according  to  the  type  of  user.  Otherwise,  such  effluent  water  quality \nstandards would end up as a mere target, not the standards which are actually imposed \nto regulate polluters based on the established value, as is currently the case in many \ndeveloping countries. \n\nQualification and Training System for Installation Business of Decentralized \nWastewater Treatment Facilities \n\nImproving the decentralized wastewater management would mandate that, when a new \nhouse  or  building  is  to  be  built,  a  municipal  construction  surveyor  checks  the  facility  \nin  the  process  of  issuing  building  permits,  as  is  the  case  in  Japan.  But,  the  building \npermits  system  works  only  if  the  decentralized  wastewater  treatment  facilities  are \nstandardized by the performance testing system. In developing counties, however, as \nmentioned earlier, the standardization of decentralized wastewater treatment facilities, \nparticularly  those  for  household  users,  would  be  difficult  at  this  moment.  Therefore,  \nit  would  be  a  realistic  policy  response  that,  while  the  government  allows  diverse \ndecentralized  wastewater  treatment  facilities,  particularly  those  for  household  use,  it \ntakes  measures  to  ensure  the  quality  of  installation  of  these  various  facilities  via  a \nqualification and training system modeled on that used in Japan. \n\nIntroducing Regular Desludging System for Decentralized Wastewater  \nTreatment Facilities \n\nMany  countries  issue  manuals  for  maintenance  of  septic  tanks,  which  indicates  their \nrecommended  desludging  frequency.  In  many  cases,  the  decision  on  the  timing  of \ndesludging  is  left  to  the  users.  As  a  consequence,  in  reality,  the  desludging  of  septic \ntanks  is  conducted  only  when  some  troubles  such  as  a  blockage  happen.  If  that  is  \nthe  case,  the  septic  tanks  would  have  lost  their  treatment  function,  thus  spreading \npollutants  prior  to  the  blockage  happening.  Therefore,  it  is  essential  to  establish  a \nregulatory  framework  in  which  the  timing  of  the  desludging  is  not  left  to  the  users.  In \nJapan, the desludging of PAWTPs is a legal obligation for the users, established as once \na  year,  with  the  timing  controlled  by  the  desludging  businesses  approved  by  \nthe municipalities. \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1001 \n \n\nK. Hashimoto \n\nIt is not clear whether a Japan-type system would work in developing countries, since \nthe  high  cost  of  desludging  (US$30\u2013$100/unit  in  Asian  developing  countries)  would \nbecome an obstacle. In both Manila City and Hai Phong City, the regular desludging of \nseptic tanks, which has been implemented in a relatively organized manner city-wide for \nover a decade, is the obligation of the utility (sewer operator) and its cost is recovered \nby  an  add-up  to  the  water  bill  (20%  of  the  water  bill  in  both  cities)  and  by  the  wide \ncollection  from  all  the  household  and  non-household  customers.  As  the  water  charge \ncontains a cross-subsidy from non-household users to household users, a similar knock-\non effect occurs with the desludging fee. In this way, the average desludging intervals of \n5\u20137 years in Manila City and 4 years in Hai Phong City are achieved. This is a different \napproach than Japan, but it may fit the actual situation of developing countries. \n\nQualification System and Training System for Desludging Business and Workers \n\nIn  Manila  City  and  Hai  Phong  City,  desludging  works  are  performed  by  water  and \nwastewater operators or sewer and drainage corporations. In many countries, including \nJapan, however, desludging works of on-site facilities such as septic tanks and PAWTPs \nare  performed  by  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises.  Some  of  these  are  micro \nenterprises, a few of which belong to the informal sector, as also used to be the case in \nJapan.  Consequently,  their  performance  is  poor,  and  they  end  up  conducting  illegal \nactivities such as dumping the collected sludge into rivers. \n\nIn order to improve this, it would be effective for the government to establish a training \nsystem for desludging technicians, and a system in which only the desludging vendors \nwho  employ  the  properly  trained  technicians  are  allowed  to  engage  in  desludging \nbusiness  so  that  the  authority  can  regulate  them,  cultivate  their  professionalism,  and \nraise their social position. \n\nQualification System and Examination System for Operators of PAWTPs  \nor Similar Facilities for Non-household Users \n\nThough  qualifications  such  as  those  for  engineers  or  graduates  from  an  engineering \nuniversity  are  not  necessary,  it  is  desirable  that  technicians  for  PAWTPs  or  similar \nfacilities attend a professional training course and pass an official examination, and it \nwould thus be good policy for developing nations to ensure such a system monitors skill \nlevels. As practiced in Japan, if the cost of the training and of the examination is paid by \nthe trainees or the companies for which they work, they would become more serious and \nthe sustainability of the training/examination system would be secured. \n\nIn  addition,  the  penalty  on  the  non-household  users  who  fail  to  engage  qualified \noperators for their PAWTP or similar facility must be strengthened.  \n\nDevelopment of Proper Sludge Treatment Facilities \n\nIn many developing countries, the development of on-site sludge treatment facilities trails \nthe  development  of  sewer  systems.  For  these  countries  to  improve  decentralized \nwastewater  management,  its  development  must  be  accelerated.  In  reality,  some  \nrecent  facilities  built  in  developing  countries  are  not  operating  properly  due  to \ninappropriate design. \n\nJapan  has  a  60-year  history  of  developing  sludge  treatment  facilities.  More  than  \n1,000 facilities were built nationwide, and while Japan\u2019s sophisticated technologies may \nnot be suitable for developing countries, the accumulated knowledge and experiences \non the basic process of on-site sludge treatment, pretreatment, solid-liquid separation, \ndisposal  of  dried  sludge,  treatment  of  supernatant  (wastewater  treatment)  would  be \nuseful for developing countries and should be shared internationally. \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1001 \n \n\nK. Hashimoto \n\nfor \n\nAmong the above-mentioned measures, the establishment of qualifications, training, and \nan  examination  system \ninstallation  workers,  desludging  business/workers  \nand operators of PAWTPs or similar facilities would consume few government resources. \nHowever, these would require political will since copious administrative work is required \nand relationships between citizens, administrations, and sanitation workers need to be \naugmented.  The  1983  PAWTP  Law  was  achieved  by  politicians  backed  \nby  sanitation  workers.  Similar  efforts  would  create  better  decentralized  wastewater \nmanagement systems and the creation of work opportunities, which are badly needed in \ndeveloping countries. In Japan, 200,000 professionals are working for the betterment of \ndecentralized wastewater management systems. \n\n \n\n \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1001 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nK.
