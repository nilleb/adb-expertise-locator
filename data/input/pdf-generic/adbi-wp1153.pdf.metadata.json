Apart from that, key challenges and main success factors in relation to \nlinking SMEs with GVCs are also identified. A total of 329 SMEs in both provinces were \nsurveyed to collect quantitative data while four and eight FGDs and KIIs, respectively, were \nconducted to gather qualitative information. Both econometric and descriptive analyses were \nemployed to accomplish the objectives of the research. The econometric analysis found that \nSMEs that are linked with GVCs have a higher level of profit than those that are not. Apart \nfrom the direct impact of GVCs, the study also observed that linking with GVCs indirectly \nincreases the performance of SMEs through enhancing the sales revenue and research  \nand development activities of SMEs. The descriptive analysis recognized five main business \nsectors,  namely  information  technology,  apparel,  gems  and  minerals,  tea  and  other \nagricultural products, and handcraft, as the sectors with the most potential to link with GVCs. \nAmong these five sectors, SMEs in information technology, apparel, and gems and minerals \nare more likely to link with GVCs. In addition, the study recognized challenges such as a lack \nof access to finance, a lack of technology, a lack of information, being unable to meet quality \nstandards, and an inability to produce the quantity required as the main obstacles to linking \nwith GVCs. Furthermore, factors such as ensuring the quality of products, the availability of \nskilled labor, better access to finance, access to better technologies, the ability to produce  \nat low cost, and access to BDSs increase the potential to link SMEs with GVCs. The findings \nof the study strongly recommend that government, nongovernment organizations, and policy \nmakers  should  encourage  SMEs  to  participate  in  GVCs  by  allowing  them  to  grow  as \ninternationally competitive entrepreneurs.  \n \nKeywords: global value chain, small and medium-sized enterprises, production networks, \nsustainable SME development \n \nJEL Classification: B17, O24, M11, Q01 \n \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1153  Deyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n \nContents \n \n \n1.

INTRODUCTION \n1.1  Global Value Chain (GVCs) and Small and Medium-Sized \nEnterprises (SMEs): Concepts and Definitions \nGlobal value chains (GVCs) have been a growing concept in global economy with the \ndevelopment of globalization. Since globalization is a common concept for all countries, \nGVCs are also linked with each and every country at different capacities irrespective  \nof the status of the countries. Moreover, Harvie and Charoenrat (2015) highlighted  \nin  particular  that  the  development  of  information  and  communication  technology, \ntransportation technology, and complex production processes has created a suitable \nenvironment for firms to engage with value chains across borders. However, there is  \nno unique and well-recognized definition of GVCs and different scholars have defined \nand explained the concept of GVCs by considering different aspects of them. According \nto ESCAP (2009), a global value chain refers to the full range of cross-border, value-\nadded business activities that are required to bring a product or service from the \nconception, design, sourcing raw materials, and intermediate input stages to production, \nmarketing, distribution, and supplying the final consumer (ESCAP 2009). In addition, \nPorter (1985) explains that value chains provide a way to identify firms\u2019 source of \ndifferentiation, and the fundamental factors that drive it. Similarly, UNCTAD (2013) \nelaborated  a  value  chain  as  a  fragmentation  of  the  production  process  and  the \ninternational dispersion of tasks and activities within these value chains has led to the \nemergence of a borderless production system. Moreover, APEC (2010) described a GVC \nas a value chain that operates in more than one economy.  \nAs Figure 1 indicates, there are two main steps in a GVC \u2013 production and distribution. \nTherefore, a GVC is a collection of numerous producers/suppliers, distributors, and \nbusiness service providers. Figure 1 below illustrates the process of a GVC and how raw \nmaterials are converted into a final product, and also the distribution process of final \nproducts.  \nAs Abe (2015) has highlighted, there are three key drivers of GVCs: (1) resource \nendowments;  (2)  market  access;  and  (3)  efficiency  maximization.  The  resource \nendowment may include advanced infrastructure, land, and other limited resources, low-\ncost  labor,  and  locational  benefits  (Feenstra  1998;  Kimura  and  Ando  2005).  As \nChristopher (2011) emphasized, efficiency maximization includes supply chain concepts \nsuch as just-in-time movement of goods, zero inventory, outsourcing and offshoring, and \nproduction agglomeration (Ronkainen, Halsall, and Heineman 2010; Kotler and Keller \n2011). As Abe (2015) elaborated, factors such as low entry barriers, an enabling \nbusiness environment, symmetric distribution of market information, and advanced \nlogistic systems are crucial to ensure better market access.  \nAbe (2015), ESCAP (2009), and Gereffi, Humphrey, and Sturgeon (2005) identified four \nmain  types  of  GVCs:  (1)  an  international  supply  market  that  requires  minimal \nrelationships among buyers and sellers and where transactions are made between \nbuyers and sellers across borders; (2) international supply markets where leading \nproducers have the controlling power over the international network of subsidiaries, \naffiliates,  and  suppliers;  (3)  a  buyer-driven  network  where  large  retailers,  brand \nmanufacturers, and marketers play the central role in the GVC; and (4) integrated firms \nwhere hierarchical governance systems are implemented and produce all major products \nin-house.  \n \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1153  Deyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n \nFigure 1: The Process of a Global Value Chain \n \nSource: Abe (2015). \nSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play a crucial role in each and every \neconomy irrespective of their development status. SMEs\u2019 contributions to the economy \nare multidimensional and output growth, employment generation, poverty alleviation, \neconomic empowerment, and export growth can be considered among them (Harvie \n2002; Asasen, Asasen, and Chuangcham 2003). As Abe et al. (2012) indicated, SMEs \naccount for more than 95% of private enterprises in Asia and have generated more than \n50% of employment. In Sri Lanka in particular, as of 2014, SMEs made up nearly 90% \nof enterprises (over 1 million SMEs), contributed 52% to the country\u2019s GDP, and \nproduced 45% of its employment. \nTable 1: Number of Persons Engaged and Percentage Distribution  \nof SMEs in Economic Sectors \nPeople Engaged  Sector-wise Distribution (percentages) \nScale of the \nEstablishment  No.  %  Industry  Trade  Service \nTotal   3,003,119  100  100  100  100 \nMicro   1,338,675  44.6  29.7  68.1  44.6 \nSmall   529,751  17.6  14.0  16.8  22.6 \nMedium-sized   386,756  12.9  16.7  5.5  13.9 \nLarge   747,937  24.9  39.6  9.5  18.9 \nNote: The definitions of types of SMEs are provided in Table 2. \nSource: Created by authors based on Ministry of Industry and Commerce (2016). \n \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1153  Deyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n \nTable 1 indicates the number of people engaged in each type of SME and the sector-\nwise percentage distribution of SMEs. The total number employed in the micro scale is \n1.3 million, which is 45% of the total, although the micro scale represented almost 92% \nof the establishments. The large-scale business sector represents almost 25% of the \nemployment, although it accounts for only 0.2% of the establishments.  \nCountries define SMEs based on different bases and dimensions and therefore different \ncountries have different definitions of SMEs. In the United States (US), the definition of \nSMEs varies by industry as well. SMEs in the manufacturing sector should have 500 or \nless employees, while in trade and wholesale sectors there should be 100 or less \nemployees. In contrast, SMEs in the mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sectors \nare eligible to have up to 1500 employees while SMEs in silver ore mining can have 250 \nemployees (Ward 2018). The Industry of Canada (2017) identified four types of SMEs \nbased on the number of employees. Industries with 1\u20124, 5\u201299, and 100\u2012499 employees \nare defined as micro, small, and medium-sized industries while industries with more than \n500  are  considered  large  industries.  The  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  has \nconsidered the number of employees, annual revenue, and assets in defining SMEs. In \nthe EU, a similar system is used to define small to medium-sized enterprises. A business \nwith a headcount of fewer than 250 is classified as medium-sized, a business with a \nheadcount of fewer than 50 is classified as small, and a business with a headcount of \nfewer than 10 is considered a microbusiness. The European system also takes into \naccount  a  business\u2019s  turnover  rate  and  its  balance  sheet.  In  fact,  the  European \nCommission considers three dimensions, namely the number of employees, the annual \nturnover, and the total balance sheet, in classifying SMEs (European Commission 2005).  \nHowever, it is crucial to focus on the Sri Lankan definition of SMEs as the current study \nis based on SMEs in Sri Lanka. As indicated in Table 2, Sri Lanka has also considered \ntwo dimensions, namely the number of employees and annual turnover, in order to \nclassify SMEs into micro, small, and medium-sized categories. Under the present SME \npolicy framework in Sri Lanka, SMEs are defined based on the number of employees \nand annual turnover. In order to qualify as an SME, an enterprise must employ less than \n300 people and generate an annual turnover of less than USD LKR 4.41 million.  \nTable 2: SME Classification in Sri Lanka \nManufacturing Sector  Service Sector \nCompany  Number of  Annual Turnover  Number of  Annual Turnover \nCategory  Employees  (Million)  Employees  (Million) \nMicro  1\u201210  \u2264 LKR 15  1\u201210  \u2264 LKR 15 \nSmall  11\u201250  \u2264 LKR 16\u2012250  11\u201250  \u2264 LKR 16\u2012250 \nMedium-sized  51\u2012300  \u2264 LKR 251\u2012750  51\u2012200  \u2264 LKR 251\u2012750 \nSource: Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Sri Lanka (2002). \nSri Lanka has also identified slightly different thresholds in terms of the number of \nemployees for manufacturing and service sectors. The current study applied the SME \nclassification indicated in Table 2.  \n1.2  Problem Statement and Objectives \nThe national policy adopted to promote SME development was documented by the \nMinistry of Industry and Commerce in 2016. The idea for this took root in 2002 with the \nlaying down of a white paper by a task force comprising government officials, business \nleaders, and members of chambers and industry. Their vision was to help SMEs to be \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1153  Deyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n \nglobally competitive through fostering an entrepreneurial culture and adopting socially \nand environmentally sustainable practices. The intervention strategies of the policy are \nillustrated by Figure 2A (left). According to this figure, factors such as an enabling \nenvironment, access to research and development, an entrepreneurial culture, skills and \ndevelopment, access to finance, and market facilitation have been recognized as the \ndeterminants of sustainable SME development.  \nFigure 2: Policy Intervention Strategies \nA  B \n   \nSource: Ministry of Industry and Commerce (2016).  Source: Modified by authors based on Ministry of Industry \nand Commerce (2016). \nHowever, the policy has not included the impact of linking with GVCs, which affects \nsustainable SME development and all the other five dimensions in Figure 2A (on the left). \nIn  fact,  linking  with  GVCs  has  become  a  novel  concept  for  most  SMEs  in  \nSri Lanka. Thus, the impact of GVCs on SMEs has not been considered by either policy \nmakers or researchers. Under this scenario, the current study examines the impact of \nGVCs  on  the  performance  of  SMEs  in  Uva  and  central  provinces  of  \nSri Lanka. Accordingly, Figure 2A can be changed by incorporating the impact of GVCs \nas illustrated in Figure 2B on the right. Hence, the study aims to provide appropriate \nsuggestions and policy implications to enrich the existing SME Development Strategic \nPlan in Sri Lanka while highlighting the benefits of getting involved with GVCs. The \nspecific objectives of the study are as follows.  \n1.  To  recognize  and  profile  the  SMEs  in  Uva  and  the  central  provinces  of  \nSri Lanka  \n2.  To examine the economic impact of GVCs on the performance of SMEs in Uva \nand the central provinces of Sri Lanka  \n3.  To  recognize  potential  local  business  sectors  and  their  intention  in  linking  \nwith GVCs \n4.  To  identify  key  challenges  and  key  success  factors  in  relation  to  linking  \nwith GVCs \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1153  Deyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n \nThe paper is structured as follows. The next section reviews the existing body of \nknowledge followed by a description of the methodology of the research. After that, \nresults and discussions are elaborated while the final section accounts for conclusions \nand recommendations followed by a list of references.  \n2.  LITERATURE REVIEW \n2.1  Challenges faced by SMEs in Sri Lanka \nA large number of empirical studies have identified key challenges faced by SMEs in \ngeneral. However, a study performed by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) \nobserved that 77% of Sri Lankan SMEs out of all the SMEs included in the study \nhighlighted the need for medium- and long-term loans for their businesses. Among them \nonly 53% of SME holders had access to bank loans and out of this 53%, only 29% of \nSMEs successfully secured their financial requirements (Nanayakkara 2011). However, \nAttygalle et al. (2014) argued that the government has formed special banks such as the \nLankaputhra Development Bank to provide loans for SMEs while other banks such as \nthe  People\u2019s  Bank,  Sanasa  Bank,  and  Regional  Development  Bank  \nalso provide such loan schemes. In contrast, Gamage (2003) highlighted that SMEs face \nsevere difficulties in accessing loans as banks and financial institutions ask for heavy \ncollateral  and  also  charge  higher  interest  rates.  Abeyratne  (2006)  conducted  \na  survey  in  Monaragala  district  in  order  to  analyze  the  key  challenges  faced  by  \nSMEs. The study identified 27% of SME holders in Monaragala district as having been \nnegatively affected by unsupportive government policies. In contrast, only 16% of SMEs \nin Monaragala district mentioned any financial difficulties faced by them. This is mainly \ndue to the availability of informal financial institutions that provide loans without any \ncollateral with repayment collected on a daily or weekly basis. However, interest rates \nattached to these loan schemes are extremely high and the borrowers do not even know \nthe  interest  rate.  In  addition  to  financial  constraints  highlighted  by  the  authors, \nnonfinancial barriers such as a lack of technology and managerial skills also hinder the \nefficiency and performance of SMEs. \nIn fact, most SMEs perform at the micro and medium level and have not linked up with \nhigh-tech industries and value chains. Similarly, Esim (2001) pointed out that SMEs in \nSri Lanka do not receive updated information about market opportunities and marketing \nskills. Esim (2001) further highlighted that in addition to the lack of access to market \nopportunities, SMEs in Sri Lanka also suffer from insufficient know-how to market their \nproducts in domestic and international markets.  \nAs Athukorala (2017) highlighted, one of the key issues in Sri Lanka is the absence of a \nclear policy that a typical small or medium-scale entrepreneur can use as a guide. In \nThailand, there was an SME promotional plan and in the Philippines there was an SME \ndevelopment plan launched with aggressive field administration. ASEAN got together \nand launched a blueprint for ASEAN SMEs that got traction, but Sri Lanka could  \nnot latch on to this. Athukorala (2017) further stressed that it would take approximately \n258 days to complete the business registration process together with a cost of 5%  \nof the land value, which is not conducive to fostering entrepreneurship. The lack of \nbusiness development services, inadequate research and development facilities, the \nlack of quality certification at district level, and the linkage to export markets not being \nreadily  available  come  up  as  key  issues  whilst  the  biggest  issue  is  the  difficulty  \nin gaining access to concessionary finance. Another point highlighted by Athukorala \n(2017) is that SMEs pay on average 28 types of taxes, which are highly complex and \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1153  Deyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n \ntime-consuming. Similarly to Athukorala (2017), Priyanath and Premaratne (2014) also \ncriticized the policy framework related to SMEs in Sri Lanka.  \nThe government SME development programs do not help SMEs to access sufficient and \nreliable  information  that  leads  to  more  rational  decision-making,  to  safeguarding \ntransactions from opportunism, and to selecting a suitable governance mechanism. SME \ndevelopment programs have neglected to support formal governance; as a result, there \nis a high possibility that SMEs in Sri Lanka have greater transaction costs, which impedes \nthe growth of SMEs (Priyanath and Premaratne 2014). Vijayakumar (2013) highlighted \nthat there is only very poor growth in SMEs, in terms of mean value of assets, value of \nturnover, and mean value of number of employees as well as growth stages of SMEs. \nThe Central Bank Annual Report of 2016 cites a World Bank study that states that firms \naged 25 years or more are only 50%\u201290% larger than firms less than five years old. \nVision 2025 has identified several steps to address this problem, such as gradation of \nmicroenterprises to SMEs. These will include: introducing policies to increase project-\nbased lending vs. collateral-based lending; removing taxes that prevent expansion; \nencouraging knowledge sharing between SMEs and R&D institutions; enhancing brand \nvalue; increasing access to markets and access to credit. The ultimate aim is to integrate \nSMEs into the formal sector. The key policy challenge is translating vision into policy and \npractice. \n2.2  Impact of Linking with GVCs on SME Development \nDuring the past few years, the organization of production has undergone significant \nchanges with its extension to the global platform. GVCs have influenced the production \nprocess, which is determined by sourcing inputs from lower sources of suppliers, finding \nmore opportunities in new marketplaces, and available strategic partnership options \n(OECD 2007). Extending SMEs into GVCs is not just a matter of internationalization but \ngoes  beyond  that.  Therefore,  restructuring  the  production  \nlevel at the global level is more essential for SMEs, especially in expanding their business \nopportunities and market outreach. It is a fact that cross-border business activities are \nchallenging and a costly step for SMEs. Most SMEs claim that insufficient resources and \ncapabilities, and inadequate self-confidence in reaching out to international markets are \nmajor obstacles to touching the global business atmosphere. Furthermore, grasping \nforeign business opportunities, maintaining control over foreign intermediaries, and \naccessing export distribution channels are also challenging for SMEs (OECD 2007). \nAlthough there are a few obstacles, overcoming them and participating in GVCs may \nbring possible benefits to SMEs. Enterprises that have successfully integrated into one \nor more value chains have been able to obtain stability or expand their businesses. It is \nevident that participation in the activities of GVCs can produce benefits for domestic \neconomies (OECD 2012). \nParticipation in GVCs provides opportunities to suppliers and individuals to acquire new \ncompetencies and skills. The trade, investment, and knowledge flows that underpin \nGVCs lead to fast learning, innovation, and industrial upgrading. GVCs have provided \ninstantaneous  access  to  new  information,  opening  up  new  market  opportunities  \nand  bringing  a  technological  learning  atmosphere  through  linked  transactions and \ninvestments. Local enterprises can enhance their performance in their own markets by \ncombining national and international intermediate inputs, and by creating economies  \nof  specialization  that  can  leverage  cross-border  complementarities  and  allow  the \nenterprises to benefit from knowledge and technology spillovers (OECD 2012). \n \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1153  Deyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n \nYuhua and Bayhaqi (2013) highlighted the benefits to SMEs of macro- and micro-level \nparticipation in global production networks, which include: (1) enhancement of technical \ncapacity; (2) increased demand for existing products and services leading to optimal \nutilization of production capacity and improvement of production efficiency; (3) enabling \nSMEs to raise equity finance from foreign investors and acquire competent human \nresources through prestige and credibility created through the global production network; \n(4) uncovering a steady and sustainable way to enter into internationalization, which may \nnot  be  impossible  for  SMEs.  Moreover,  according  to  Yuhua  and  Bayhaqi  (2013), \nparticipation of SMEs in global production networks may provide benefits, such as: (1) \nfast-growing economies identify SME sectors as one of the positive and influencing \nfactors in economic growth; (2) GVCs create a number of job opportunities for the local \ncommunity; (3) SMEs can expand their exports to foreign markets and allow them to \ncreate  a  tank  of  foreign  reserves  that  is  necessary  for  the  growth  of  developing \neconomies; (4) consequently GVCs provide a solid platform for the sustainable economic \ngrowth and development of local economies and businesses through SME sector \nparticipation.  \nHowever, no studies have been conducted to examine the impact of GVCs on SMEs in \nSri Lanka. The current study believes that incorporating with GVCs will be crucial to \novercome the highlighted challenges related to the Sri Lankan SME industry. Since  \nno previous studies have systematically addressed the impact of GVCs on SMEs  \nin Sri Lanka, the present study attempts to fill the gaps in both the literature and  \npolicy framework. \n3.  METHODOLOGY \n3.1  Study Area and Data Collection Procedures \nThe study mainly focuses on four districts (Badulla, Monaragal, Matale, and Nuwara \nEliya) located in Uva and the central provinces. In particular, the selected districts \nrepresent  rural  and  estate  sectors  where  most  of  the  lower-income  groups  and \nmarginalized groups are located. Moreover, the government has started a special \nprogram to enhance the profile of the SMEs in both Uva and the central provinces in \norder to reduce poverty through providing better employment opportunities. Moreover, \ndistricts such as Colombo and Gampaha located in the western province feature both \nmedium- and large-scale industries rather than SMEs. Furthermore, it is easy to find two \ngroups, one that engaged with GVCs and one that did not, in both Uva and the central \nprovinces and this allows the impacts of GVCs on SMEs\u2019 performance across both \ngroups to be compared.  \nThe study will be mainly based on primary data, although it is expected that some \nsecondary data will be collected from the desk review. The proposed study uses the \nfollowing data collection tools to collect required data. \n1.  Enterprise survey with SME holders \n2.  Focus group discussions (FGDs) \n3.  Key informant interviews (KIIs) \nTable  3  elaborates  the  data  collection  procedure  in  detail.  The  study  collected  \nrelevant quantitative data from 329 SME holders located across the four districts of  \ntwo provinces by applying the snowball sampling technique. Moreover, four FGDs and \neight KIIs were also conducted to collect qualitative data required for the study.  \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1153  Deyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n \nTable 3: Details of the Survey, FGDs, and KIIs \nNo. of Divisional  FGDs  KIIs \nProvinces  Districts  Secretariat Divisions  Total \nUva Province  Badulla  DS 1  18  1  2 \n  DS 2  18 \n  DS 3  15 \n  DS 4  18 \n  DS 5  15 \nMonaragala  DS 1  17  1  2 \n  DS 2  17 \n  DS 3  16 \n  DS 4  19 \n  DS 5  12 \nCentral  Matale  DS 1  18  1  2 \nProvince    DS 2  14 \n  DS 3  15 \n  DS 4  16 \n  DS 5  16 \nNuwara Eliya  DS 1  19  1  2 \n  DS 2  16 \n  DS 3  23 \n  DS 4  12 \n  DS 5  15 \nTotal      329  4  8 \nSource: Created by authors. \n3.2  Data Analysis  \nBoth econometric and descriptive analyses are incorporated to accomplish the objectives \nof the study. Moreover, qualitative information collected through FGDs and KIIs is used \nto validate the quantitative findings and also to provide in-depth analysis on GVC and \nSME development in the context of Sri Lanka.  \nEconometric Analysis \nAn econometric analysis was employed to quantify the impact of engaging with GVCs \non SME development. The following empirical model was estimated to accomplish the \nmain objectives of the study. The empirical model is aligned with the econometric model \nused by Vidavong (2019) in the context of Lao PDR and also empirical studies by Dikova \net al. (2015) and Biesebroeck (2005). Logarithmic values of all continuous variables were \ntaken to reduce unnecessary variation of the variables. Similarly, profits of firms were \nconsidered as a proxy for the performance of SMEs. Moreover, a dummy variable was \nassigned to measure the impacts of GVCs on SMEs\u2019 performance as the dummy variable \nallows comparison of the impacts across two groups \u2012 SMEs that are engaged with \nGVCs and SMEs not engaged with GVCs.  \n\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 =\ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd0+\ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd1\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd 2(\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 \u00d7\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56)+\ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd3(\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\u00d7\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56)+\ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd4(\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\u00d7 (1) \n\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56)+\ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd5\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 +\ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd6\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 +\ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd7\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 +\ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd8\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 +\ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd9\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 +\ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd10\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 +\nThe var\ud835\udefd\ud835\udefdia1b1\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59le\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59s\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3ain\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59d\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56ic+a\ud835\udefd\ud835\udefdte1d2\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59 in\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43th\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 +em\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48p\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56irical model are explained in Table 4 below.  \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1153  Deyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n \nTable 4: Operationalization and Explanation of Variables  \nVariable Name  Explanation  Expected Sign \nProfit  Annual profit of the firm after tax    \nGVC  Dummy variable for global value chain  Positive when GVC = 1 \nGVC = 1 for SMEs that are engaged in GVC \nGVC = 0 for SMEs that are not engaged in GVC \nlnSL  Log of annual sales revenue  Positive \nlnTR  Log of number of employees who are trained annually   Positive \nlnRD  Log of share of R&D expenditure in total revenue  Positive \nlnK  Log of total capital of the firm  Positive \nlnL  Log of number of workers  Positive \nlnHC  Log of the level of education of SME holder  Positive \nlnAGE  Log of age of SME holder  Positive \nTYPE  Dummy variable for type of SME  Negative when TYPE = 1 \nTYPE = 1 for small \nTYPE = 0 for otherwise (medium and large) \nSource: Created by authors. \nSummary  statistics  related  to  each  variable  (without  logarithm)  are  presented  in  \nTable 5 below.  \nTable 5: Summary Statistics of Variables  \nNumber of \nVariables  Units of Variables  Observations  Maximum  Minimum  Mean \nProfit  Sri Lankan Rupee  329  275,000  17,500  185,000 \nGVC  Dummy Variable  329  1  0  0.49 \nSL  Sri Lanka Rupee  329  552,402  39,142  209,231 \nTR  Number of Employees  329  120  1  24 \nRD  Sri Lanka Rupee  329  120,000  15,000  35,000 \nK  Sri Lanka Rupee  329  120,0000  95,000  1 \nL  Number of Employees  329  375  2  68 \nHC  Years of Schooling  329  19  1  13 \nAGE  Years  329  69  20  52 \nSource: Created by authors based on survey data. \nIn addition to the econometric analysis, a descriptive analysis is also utilized in support \nof the objectives of the research.  \n4.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n4.1  Profiling the SMEs in Uva and the Central Provinces  \nof Sri Lanka \nProfiling the identified enterprises in four districts is important in order to understand the \nsalient  features  and  composition  of  SMEs.  This  allows  for  a  comprehensive \nunderstanding of existing SMEs, which in turn enables evaluation of their performance, \nlimitations, challenges, etc. Therefore, this section profiles the SMEs based on gender, \n9 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1153  Deyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n \nage structure, educational attainment of the entrepreneurs, source of capital, average \nmonthly income of the SMEs, and number of workers employed. \nSMEs\u2019 Participation in GVCs and Profit of SMEs \nThe SMEs that export their products or services as a final or intermediate product  \nor service are considered to be SMEs participating in GVCs. Enumerators asked \nrespondents whether they engage with such a process and accordingly the respondents \nwere classified as GVC or non-GVC SMEs. Table 6 clearly indicates the percentage and \nnumber of SMEs that are classified as GVC and non-GVC SMEs across four districts.  \nTable 6: Distribution of GVC and Non-GVC SMEs across the Districts \nDistricts  GVC  Non-GVC  Total \nBadulla  35 (41.7%)  49 (58.3%)  84 (100%) \nMonaragala  28 (34.6%)  53 (65.4%)  81 (100%) \nMatale  51 (64.6%)  28 (35.4%)  79 (100%) \nNuwara Eliya  47 (55.3%)  38 (44.7%)  85 (100%) \nSource: Calculated by authors based on enterprise survey. \nAccording to Table 6, Matale and Nuwara Eliya districts are the districts where more than \n50%  of  SMEs  engage  with  GVCs.  In  particular,  64.6%  and  55.3%  of  SMEs  \nin  Matale  and  Nuwara  Eliya,  respectively,  engage  with  GVCs.  However,  SME \nparticipation in GVCs is significantly lower in both Badulla (41.7%) and Monaragal \n(34.6%) than in Matale and Nuwara Eliya. In fact, Badulla and Monaragala districts are \nextremely remote and lack infrastructure, information, and financial facilities compared \nto the other two districts considered.  \nFurthermore, profit is the key variable and was assigned as the dependent variable of \nthe model. The profit was calculated by subtracting the cost of all inputs and taxes from \nsales revenue. Figure 3 compares the average monthly profit of GVC and non-GVC \nSMEs across four districts. The figure clearly shows that SMEs linked with GVCs achieve \na higher average profit than non-GVC SMEs. In general, SMEs in Matale district achieve \nthe highest average profit followed by Monaragala. Interestingly, the average profit levels \nof SMEs that are engaged in GVCs are considerably higher than that of the average \nprofit for SMEs in all four districts, which is Rs. 178,125.  \nFigure 3: Average Monthly Profit of SMEs in Four Districts (in Sri Lankan rupees) \n \nSource: Created by authors based on enterprise survey. \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1153  Deyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n \nMoreover, as Figure 3 illustrates, the difference in profit of both GVC and non-GVC SMEs \nis more substantial in Matale and Badulla districts while Nuwara Eliya district has the \nlowest profit related to GVC SMEs.  \nGender Composition of SME Holders \nFigure 4 depicts the gender composition of SMEs in the four districts of Uva and the \ncentral provinces. On average, the number of female entrepreneurs is lower than that of \nmales and this trend is more pronounced in Nuwara Eliya district, where our survey \ncaptured only 17 female-headed SMEs (20%) as compared to 68 SMEs run by males. \nIn fact, the majority of women in Nuwara Eliya district are employed in the plantation \nsector, where there are only limited opportunities for them to become entrepreneurs. \nHowever, the gender gap in SME ownership is comparatively low in both Monaragala \nand Badulla districts where 39 (48.1%) and 35 (41.7%) SMEs, respectively, are run  \nby females.  \nFigure 4: Gender Composition of SMEs in Four Districts \n \nSource: Created by authors based on enterprise survey. \nAccording to the survey results, in the Badulla district, the majority of agriculture-based \nSMEs (72.0%) are run by males while the majority of industry-based SMEs are run by \nfemales (56.8%). However, an opposite trend is seen in Monaragala, where a majority \nof females operate agriculture-based micro SMEs (53.3%), while the majority of industrial \nSMEs are run by males (54.9%). In contrast, the gender composition for SMEs in the \nNuwara Eliya district is extremely male-skewed and the majority of SMEs in all three \nsectors (agriculture, industry, and service) are owned by males while the proportion \nheaded by females is very low.  \nTable 7 indicates that according to the survey findings, 62.3% of businesses are run by \nmales while only 37.7% are owned by females, thereby showing a significant gender gap \nin the four districts.  \n   \n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1153  Deyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n \nTable 7: Gender Composition of SMEs by Type of Business \nSex \nType of Business  Female  Male  Total \nAgriculture, farming, and dairy  27  (27.3%)  72  (72.7%)  99 \nArts and crafts  8  (23.5%)  26  (76.5%)  34 \nApparel and bags  39  (70.9%)  16  (29.1%)  55 \nAuto parts and maintenance  1  (12.5%)  7  (87.5%)  8 \nFood and beverages  23  (40.4%)  34  (59.6%)  57 \nHotels and homestay  5  (35.7%)  9  (64.3%)  14 \nCement and metalwork  9  (37.5%)  15  (62.5%)  24 \nFurniture  4  (33.3%)  8  (66.7%)  12 \nSalons and spas  2  (28.6%)  5  (71.4%)  7 \nHousehold items  4  (57.1%)  3  (42.9%)  7 \nOther  2  (16.7%)  10  (83.3%)  12 \nTotal  124  (37.7%)  205  (62.3%)  329 \nSource: Created by author based on enterprise survey. \nAge Structure of SME Holders \nTable 8 summarizes the age composition of SME holders in the four districts based on \nthe main economic sectors.

It should be noted that information related to income could be extremely \nsubjective, thus the data presented in this regard should be used with caution.  \nIt was revealed that the incomes of industry-related SMEs were higher in the Monaragala \ndistrict than in the other two SME sectors. Income from industry-related SMEs was \nreported as being the second highest in the other three districts. Agriculture-related \nSMEs in the Badulla district seem to be performing better as their income is the highest \namong the three SME sectors.

Three models were estimated by adding independent \nvariables gradually in order to check the robustness of the relationship between GVCs \nand the profit of SMEs.  \nThe key variable, GVC, and another three independent variables, namely capital, labor, \nand human capital, were included in model 1. Model 2 incorporated additional variables \nsuch as sales revenue, number of annually trained workers, expenditure on research \nand development, age of the firm, and type of SME. Finally, the third model can be \nconsidered the complete model, which measures both direct and indirect impacts of \nGVCs on the profit of SMEs along with the impacts of other characteristics of firms. \nSpecifically, interaction terms included in the third model estimate the indirect effect of \nGVCs through the sale revenue, training, and research and development of firms.  \nIt is worth highlighting that the estimated coefficients for GVCs in all three models are \npositive and statistically significant at the 1% level. This implies that SMEs that have \nengaged with GVCs achieve a higher profit than SMEs that have not. Specifically, this \nrelationship is consistent even when the models are controlled by other characteristics \nof firms. In fact, SMEs that have engaged with GVCs have a higher potential to enhance \ncompetitiveness, productivity, and also economies of scale while reducing production \ncosts. Moreover, GVCs allow SMEs to link with a broader network in the international \nbusiness arena, which is crucial for SMEs that are in the growing stage. Scholars such \nas Harvie, Narjoko, and Oum (2010), Yuhua (2014), and Arudchelvan and Wignaraja \n(2015) also indicated that SMEs participating in GVCs can increase their profit through \nhigher  competitiveness  and  production  cost  efficiency.  Moreover,  Pietrobelli  and \nRabellotti (2011) confirmed that GVCs benefit SMEs through production expansions and \n \n1  This observation is supported by the estimated VIF being 4.46 from the regression in Table 12, while the \ncommonly agreed threshold for the presence of multicollinearity is greater than 10. \n15 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1153  Deyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n \nnew information, and in turn the profit of SMEs also increases. Therefore, it is apparent \nfrom the estimated results that engaging with GVCs essentially increases the profit of \nSMEs in Sri Lanka, which ensures future development of such SMEs.  \nTable 12: Impact of GVC on Performance of SMEs  \nVariable Name  Model 1  Model 2  Model 3 \nGVC  0.8091***  0.7863***  0.7231*** \n(0.1321)  (0.2314)  (0.2256) \nlnK  0.7732***  0.6352**  0.6733** \n(0.2124)  (0.2931)  (0.3167) \nlnL  0.2341***  0.2031**  0.2122** \n(0.0814)  (0.0987)  (0.0923) \nlnHC  0.0813**  0.0736**  0.0675 \n(0.0387)  (0.0352)  (0.1064) \nlnSL    0.8056**  0.7863** \n(0.2787)  (0.3848) \nlnTR    0.0245**  0.0271 \n(0.0109)  (0.0324) \nlnRD    0.0223*  0.0127 \n(0.0116)  (0.0267) \nlnAGE    0.8201  0.7861 \n(0.8971)  (0.9171) \nTYPE    \u20130.1897***  \u20130.2787** \n(0.0621)  (0.1072) \nGVC x lnSL      0.2018** \n(0.0827) \nGVC x lnTR      0.0626 \n(0.7871) \nGVC x lnRD      0.0876** \n(0.0372) \nConstant  12.7161***  8.8971***  6.6371*** \n(0.9781)  (0.8181)  (0.8761) \nNumber of Observations  329  329  329 \nR2  0.4582  0.5672  0.7762 \nProb on F  0.0000  0.0000  0.0000 \n*** 1% significance level, ** 5% significance level, * 10% significance level. \nNote: Standard errors are in parentheses. \nSource: Estimated by authors. \nApart from the direct impact of GVCs, the indirect effects of GVCs are also taken into \naccount by incorporating interaction terms. As model 3 indicates, both interaction terms \n\u2013 (GVC x lnSL) and (GVC x lnRD) \u2012 have a positive coefficient and are also statistically \nsignificant at the 5% level. This reflects the fact that SMEs that have engaged with GVCs \nhave higher sales revenue and research and development capabilities than those that \nhave not. Therefore, GVCs increase the profit of Sri Lankan SMEs through enhancing \nsales revenue and research and development activities and this is in line with the \nempirical findings of Vidavong (2019).  \nIn addition to the key findings, the estimated models also confirm that factors such as \ncapital assets, number of workers, and sales revenue of firms also positively affect the \nprofit of SMEs. More specifically, a 1% increase in capital and labor may increase the \nprofit of the SMEs considered by 0.67% and 0.21%, respectively. Human capital has also \nbeen recognized as a factor in the profit of SMEs when the model is not controlled for \n16 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1153  Deyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n \ninteraction terms. In addition, considering the estimated coefficient for the variable \n\u201cTYPE\u201d (\u20130.2787), it is apparent that the profits of small-scale SMEs are significantly \nlower  than  those  of  medium-  and  large-scale  SMEs.  The  estimated  models  are \nstatistically significant at the 1% level overall and also have a higher R2 value in model 3 \n(0.7762), representing a higher level of goodness of fit.  \n4.3  Recognizing Potential Local Business Sectors  \nand Their Intention to Link with GVCs \nPotential Local Business Sectors \nIt is recognized that Sri Lanka has only a limited number of SMEs that have linked with \nGVCs. However, there are numerous business sectors that have a higher potential to be \nlinked with GVCs. The study initially conducted KIIs with relevant experts in the field to \nexplore business sectors that can be easily linked with GVCs. Figure 6 indicates the \nrecognized business sectors that can be connected with GVCs and the figure also \nillustrates the magnitude of the potential in relation to each recognized business sector \nbased on a five-point Likert scale.  \nFigure 6: Recognized Business Sectors and their Potential  \nto Be Linked with GVCs \n \nSource: Created by authors based on KIIs and survey. \nAccording to KIIs, five main business sectors, namely information technology, apparel, \ngems and minerals, tea and other agricultural products, and handcraft, were recognized \nas the sectors with the most potential. As Figure 6 illustrates, the information technology \nsector and the apparel sector seem to be the sectors with the highest potential for GVCs. \nMore than 70% of the respondents confirmed that these two sectors have \u201chigher \npotential\u201d  while  less  than  5%  indicated  \u201cno  potential\u201d  to  \nlink with GVCs. Moreover, 68% and 62% of the respondents mentioned that both  \ngems and minerals and tea sectors, respectively, have a higher potential to link with \ninternational markets.  \n   \n17 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1153  Deyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n \nWe have the best gems and also a world-famous tea brand \u2013 Ceylon Tea. I don\u2019t \nthink we have capitalized on the opportunities that come from such world popular \nbrand names yet. In particular, tea should be promoted as a value-added product \nthat can be easily marketed internationally. Although some companies have \nalready  started,  there  are  ample  opportunities  still  available  \nfor new firms and they can make use of this opportunities to get into GVCs. \n(Source: KII \u2013 01 \u2013 A Government Officer in Badulla District, 12/10/2019)  \nIn addition to tea, other agricultural products such as organic fruits and vegetables, and \nvalue-added products such as banana chips and tomato pulp and sauce can also be \nlinked with GVCs. In particular, during the harvesting season bananas and tomatoes can \nbe stored at low cost and also fruit pulps and sauce can be prepared with the available \ntechnology in the country. These semi-value-added products can then be linked with \nGVCs efficiently and ensure better earning opportunities for such entrepreneurs.  \nWe have more than 150 farmers and they produce high-quality cucumbers and \nbell peppers. They also use more advanced technology for their cultivation and \nalso to build their greenhouses. Currently, more than 50% of the output of  \nour organization is purchased by SriLankan Catering of SriLankan Airlines.  \nWe have the potential to double our capacity, if demand can be ensured. (Source: \nFGD  \u2012  02  \u2013  An  Organization  of  Greenhouse  Farmers  in  Badulla  District, \n14/10/2019) \nIt is apparent from the above statement that SMEs in the agricultural sector also have \nhigher potential to access GVCs. Moreover, the KIIs and survey also emphasized the \npotential to link handcraft-related SMEs to GVCs.  \nIntention of Potential Business Sectors to Link with GVCs \nThe study explores the intention of recognized business sectors to link with GVCs. Figure \n7 illustrates the level of intention of each business sector to link with GVCs. According to \nFigure 6, 69% of information technology-related SMEs and 67% of apparel-related SMEs \nreported that they have a \u201chigher intention\u201d related to linking with GVCs. In particular, \nSMEs in the information technology sector have a greater intention to expand their \nservices internationally and link with GVCs in order to achieve the benefits of a globalized \nworld. Similarly, the garment and apparel sector in which Sri Lanka has comparative \nadvantages compared to other regional counterparts has also been searching for global \nopportunities. In fact, their greater intention to link with GVCs is justifiable considering \nboth the quality of Sri Lankan apparel and the higher demand from international markets.  \nIn our district we have both human and physical resources required for garment \nand apparel industries. We have a good and efficient supply chain in a local \nmarket and some medium-level garment factories export their production through \nintermediaries. Since we have the capacity, technology, and also skilled labor, \nwe have also been looking for some opportunities to reach the global market. \n(FGD \u2013 03 \u2013 An Owner of a Garment Factory in Monaragala District, 22/10/2019) \nIn addition, entrepreneurs in business sectors such as gems and minerals, and tea and \nother agricultural products have also shown a greater desire to engage with GVCs. More \nspecifically, 65%, 62%, and 60% of SME holders, respectively, in the gems and minerals, \nand tea and other agricultural product sectors have reported that they have higher \nintentions to link with GVCs.  \nFigure 7: Level of Intention of Business Sectors to Link with GVC \n18 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1153  Deyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n \n \nSource: Created by authors based on KIIs and survey. \n4.4  Challenges and Key Success Factors Related to Coping \nwith GVCs \nChallenges Related to Linking with GVCs \nAlthough SMEs can earn ample benefits through joining GVCs, there are a number of \nbarriers that hinder SMEs\u2019 participation in GVCs. The current study recognized 10 main \nchallenges that SMEs face when they attempt to link with GVCs, and Figure 7 illustrates \nhow  SME  holders  have  ranked  these  challenges  based  on  their  severity.  \nAs Figure 8 shows, a lack of access to finance, a lack of technology, and a lack of \ninformation can be recognized as the three key challenges. More specifically, 42% of the \nrespondents who recognized a lack of access to finance as a challenge have marked it \nas a \u201csevere challenge\u201d while 34% have recognized it as a \u201cchallenge.\u201d Moreover, 40% \nand 34% of SME holders have recognized a lack of technology and a lack of information \nas \u201csevere challenges\u201d when expanding their business globally. In fact, access to finance \nhas been a critical issue in relation to expansion of SMEs even in the local market. Most \nof the government and private commercial banks are reluctant to provide financial \nfacilities to SMEs, indicating that financing SMEs is a risk to banks. Furthermore, most \nof the microfinance institutions functioning in Sri Lanka have imposed higher but hidden \ninterest rates on their loans and consequently SMEs may end up in a debt trap.  \nI started this business using the inheritance from my parents. Now the business \nis running smoothly but I need financial support to expand this business further. \nI discussed this with a few banks and their procedures and standards are too high \nfor us to afford. Although microfinance institutions are willing to finance us, I know \ntheir interest rates are too high and a few of my fellow businessmen have had \nvery bad experiences with their loan schemes.

The  global  market  needs  high-quality  products  and  also  at  a \ncompetitive price. However, how can we increase quality and reduce production \ncosts when outdated technology is used? We don\u2019t even have cool room facilities \nto store fruits and vegetables. Hence, there should be a proper and long-term \nmechanism to enhance technology related to food processing. (Source: SME \nholder, food processing, in Nuwara Eliya District, 23/10/2019) \nIn addition to the three key challenges, being unable to meet the quality standards of the \ninternational market, being unable to meet the production capacity demanded by the \nglobal market, unpopularity of the product in the market, a lack of government support, \na lack of infrastructure, a lack of skilled labor, and legal barriers are also recognized as \nbarriers to SMEs going global. Among these challenges, being unable to meet the quality \nstandard and the quantity demanded by the international market are also mainly due to \na lack of technology. Hence, it is apparent that these challenges are linked with each \nother and therefore the final impact might be much more adverse than expected. \nFurthermore, it seems that government support has also not been sufficient to overcome \nthe challenges attached with SMEs. SMEs need to expand their business in the global \narena. In fact, the government of Sri Lanka has been implementing different strategies \nhighlighted in Section 1.1 in order to promote SMEs at national level. However, there is \nno  proper  mechanism  or  policy  implementation  in  relation  \nto  linking  SMEs  with  GVCs.  Moreover,  there  is  a  lack  of  coordination  between \ngovernment policies, policy makers, and implementers. For instance, the recent policy \nformulation called \u201cEnterprise Sri Lanka\u201d was launched to provide low-interest rate loans \nfor SMEs through government commercial banks. However, the commercial banks still \navoid  providing  loans  to  SMEs,  saying  that  \u201cEnterprise  Sri  Lanka\u201d  has  not  been \nimplemented yet.  \n \n20 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1153  Deyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n \nKey Success Factors Related to Joining GVCs  \nIn addition to the barriers related to joining GVCs, it is crucial to recognize key success \nfactors that stimulate the process of linking SMEs with GVCs. The survey conducted in \nthe current study recognized 12 success factors that every SME should focus on in order \nto ensure they link up with a GVC. Figure 9 indicates all recognized success factors \nalong with their level of importance.  \nAs Figure 9 visualizes, ensuring a higher level of quality, the availability of skilled labor, \nand access to better finance have become the most crucial success factors that can push \nSMEs into linking with GVCs. In particular, 64% of SME holders stressed that the quality \nof products was \u201cvery important\u201d while 62% equally recognized that having skilled labor \nand better access to finance were also \u201cvery important.\u201d In fact, the global market is \nhighly  competitive  and  therefore  the  quality  of  products  and  services  plays  \na major role when competing with homogeneous products from different countries. \nMoreover, most of the successful SMEs in Sri Lanka have better access to finance and \nalso have productive and skilled workers. Better access to finance fulfills all types of \nfinancial  requirements  of  firms  while  skilled  labor  sustains  an  efficient  production \nprocess. In addition, access to better technologies and the ability to produce at low cost \nare also recognized as \u201cvery important\u201d by 58% and 53% of respondents, respectively. \nIn fact, technological improvements are always linked with the success of businesses in \ndifferent ways. On the one hand, advanced and appropriate technology plays a major \nrole in ensuring both quality and quantity of outputs, and on the other hand, technological \ndevelopment makes the distribution process more efficient. Similarly, the ability to \nproduce at low cost is also very important in order to compete with other suppliers in the \nglobal market. \nFigure 9: Key Success Factors that Promote SMEs\u2019 Link with GVCs  \n \nSource: Created by authors based on KIIs and Survey. \nMoreover, business development services (BDSs) also play a vital role when SMEs look \nfor global opportunities. BDSs enhance SMEs\u2019 awareness related to global opportunities \nwhile providing necessary guidance and instructions on the process of GVCs. Similarly, \nBDSs generate networking opportunities for SMEs at both local and global levels. \n21 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1153  Deyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n \nTherefore, according to the findings of the survey, 51% and 34% of SME holders have \nreported that access to BDSs is \u201cvery important\u201d and \u201cimportant,\u201d respectively.  \nActually, the BDS given by \u2026\u2026\u2026 organization was highly important for me to \nmake my business more successful. They enriched us in many aspects such as \nhow to register a business, how to access financial opportunities, what the \navailable advanced technologies are, currently available global opportunities, the \nlegal background of the international market, and import and export procedures. \nTherefore, BDSs are a main success factor in relation to SMEs that are willing to \ngo  global.  (Source:  SME  holder,  apparel  sector,  in  Monaragala  District, \n22/10/2019) \nIn addition to the above highlighted success factors, awareness related to international \ntrade procedures, the ability to produce innovations, better access to information related \nto global markets, institutional support, and networking with both local and international \npartners  are  also  recognized  as  \u201cvery  important\u201d  factors  by  more  than  30%  of \nrespondents on average.  \n5.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \nThe current study focuses on the impact of GVCs on the performance of SMEs in Uva \nand the central provinces of Sri Lanka. Moreover, the study examines potential local \nbusiness sectors that can be linked with GVCs and also key challenges and main \nsuccess factors in relation to linking SMEs with GVCs. A mixed research method that \ncombined both quantitative and qualitative data and analytical tools was employed  \nto accomplish the research objectives. More specifically, 329 SMEs were surveyed  \nto collect quantitative data while four and eight FGDs and KIIs were respectively \nconducted to gather qualitative information. A regression equation based on three \ndifferent models was econometrically estimated to quantify the impact of linking with \nGVCs on the performance of SMEs while descriptive analysis was employed in relation \nto other objectives of the study. According to the survey findings, over 60% of the  \n200 entrepreneurs were male. It is felt that the patriarchal values still prevail in these \nprovinces. Nevertheless, there are signs of change with several initiatives of multiple \norganizations targeting the empowerment of women. The average age of SME holders \nis between 40 and 50. SME holders in the Nuwara Eliya district have the lowest \neducational qualifications followed by the Monaragala district, while SME holders in  \nthe Badulla and Matale districts have the highest educational attainments. According  \nto the survey findings, over 80% of the SMEs in each district are at a micro level.  \nThe Badulla district accounts for the largest number of micro-level SMEs followed  \nby the Monaragala district. There are a larger number of industrial sector SMEs than \nagriculture and service sector ones. According to the survey findings, about 80% of \nmicro-level SMEs in the Matale district are industry related while 71.8% and 56.4% are \nin the Monaragala and Badulla districts, respectively. The study recognized 10 main \ntypes of business, including agriculture, farming and dairy industry, food and beverages, \narts and craft, and apparel and bag production. \nThe econometric analysis found that SMEs that are linked with GVCs have a higher level \nof profit than SMEs that are not. Therefore, there is a positive relationship between linking \nwith GVCs and SMEs\u2019 performance and this relationship is consistent even when the \nmodels are controlled by other firm characteristics. Apart from the direct impact of GVCs \non SMEs\u2019 performance, the study also observed that linking with GVCs indirectly \nincreases the performance of SMEs through enhancing the sales revenue and research \nand development activities of SMEs. In addition to the key findings, the estimated models \n22 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1153  Deyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n \nalso confirm that factors such as capital assets, number of workers, sales revenue of \nfirms, human capital, and types of SMEs also affect the performance of SMEs. The \ndescriptive  analysis  recognized  five  main  business  sectors,  namely  information \ntechnology,  apparel,  gems  and  minerals,  tea  and  other  agricultural  products,  and \nhandcraft, as the sectors with the most potential to link with GVCs. Moreover, among \nthese five business sectors, SMEs in business sectors such as information technology, \napparel, and gems and minerals have greater intention to link with GVCs. Furthermore, \nthe study recognized a total of 10 key challenges that SMEs face when they attempt to \nlink with GVCs. Challenges such as a lack of access to finance, a lack of technology, a \nlack of information, being unable to meet quality standards, and being unable to produce \nthe quantity required were recognized as the most critical challenges. In addition to key \nchallenges, the survey also identified 12 key success factors that stimulate the process \nof linking SMEs with GVCs. As the survey highlighted, factors such as ensuring the \nquality of products, the availability of skilled labor, better access to finance, access to \nbetter technologies, the ability to produce at low cost, and access to BDSs increase the \npotential to link SMEs with GVCs. \nThe  findings  of  the  study  strongly  indicate  that  government,  nongovernment \norganizations,  and  policy  makers  should  encourage  SMEs  to  participate  in  GVCs  \nby allowing them to grow as internationally competitive entrepreneurs. Firstly, it is \nessential to recognize new SMEs that are interested in linking with GVCs and also SMEs \nthat are already involved with GVCs. Then, it is recommended to ensure a solid public-\nprivate partnership in order to inculcate an entrepreneurial culture in the society and to \nprovide advanced technological know-how. Advanced technological know-how can be \nattracted  through  foreign  direct  investments  (FDIs)  and  therefore  both  Uva  \nand the central provinces should facilitate to access to such FDIs efficiently. Moreover, \nlocal and international training for SME holders can also be an option to enhance \ntechnological  know-how.  Moreover,  financial  facilities  and  also  access  to  financial \nfacilities should be improved by getting the help of both state-owned and private banks \nand financial institutions. In particular, recognized SME sectors such as information \ntechnology,  apparel,  gems  and  minerals,  tea  and  other  agricultural  products,  and \nhandcraft should be prioritized when providing financial facilities. Additionally, SMEs \nshould be enriched with symmetric and efficient information and awareness regarding \nGVCs and production networks, required infrastructures, appropriate BDSs, and training \nprograms to develop human capital capabilities to enhance the SMEs\u2019 potential to link \nwith GVCs.  \n \n   \n23 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1153  Deyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n \nREFERENCES \nAbe, M.

We also identify key challenges and main success factors in relation to linking SMEs with GVCs. A total of 329 SMEs in both provinces were surveyed to collect quantitative data while four and eight FGDs and KIIs, respectively, were conducted to gather qualitative information. Both econometric and descriptive analyses were employed to accomplish the objectives of the research. The econometric analysis found that SMEs that are linked with GVCs have a higher level of profit than those that are not. Apart from the direct impact of GVCs, we also observe that linking with GVCs indirectly increases the performance of SMEs through enhancing the sales revenue and research and development activities of SMEs. The descriptive analysis recognized five main business sectors, namely information technology, apparel, gems and minerals, tea and other agricultural products, and handcraft, as the sectors with the most potential to link with GVCs. Among these five sectors, SMEs in information technology, apparel, and gems and minerals are more likely to link with GVCs. In addition, we recognized challenges, such as a lack of access to finance, a lack of technology, a lack of information, being unable to meet quality standards, and an inability to produce the quantity required, as the main obstacles to linking with GVCs. Furthermore, factors such as ensuring the quality of products, the availability of skilled labor, better access to finance, access to better technologies, the ability to produce at low cost, and access to BDSs increase the potential to link SMEs with GVCs. The findings of our study strongly recommend that government, nongovernment organizations, and policy makers should encourage SMEs to participate in GVCs by allowing them to grow as ", "Title": "Impact of Global Value Chains on Performance of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in Sri Lanka: Evidence from Sri Lanka"}}
