INTRODUCTION \n\nDeyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n\n1.1  Global Value Chain (GVCs) and Small and Medium-Sized \n\nEnterprises (SMEs): Concepts and Definitions \n\nGlobal value chains (GVCs) have been a growing concept in global economy with the \ndevelopment of globalization. Since globalization is a common concept for all countries, \nGVCs  are  also  linked  with  each  and  every  country  at  different  capacities  irrespective  \nof  the  status  of  the  countries.  Moreover,  Harvie  and  Charoenrat  (2015)  highlighted  \nin  particular  that  the  development  of  information  and  communication  technology, \ntransportation  technology,  and  complex  production  processes  has  created  a  suitable \nenvironment  for  firms  to  engage  with  value  chains  across  borders.  However,  there  is  \nno unique and well-recognized definition of GVCs and different scholars have defined \nand explained the concept of GVCs by considering different aspects of them. According \nto ESCAP (2009), a global value chain refers to the full range of cross-border, value-\nadded  business  activities  that  are  required  to  bring  a  product  or  service  from  the \nconception, design, sourcing raw materials, and intermediate input stages to production, \nmarketing,  distribution,  and  supplying  the  final  consumer  (ESCAP  2009).  In  addition, \nPorter  (1985)  explains  that  value  chains  provide  a  way  to  identify  firms\u2019  source  of \ndifferentiation,  and  the  fundamental  factors  that  drive  it.  Similarly,  UNCTAD  (2013) \nelaborated  a  value  chain  as  a  fragmentation  of  the  production  process  and  the \ninternational dispersion of tasks and activities within these value chains has led to the \nemergence of a borderless production system. Moreover, APEC (2010) described a GVC \nas a value chain that operates in more than one economy.  \n\nAs Figure 1 indicates, there are two main steps in a GVC \u2013 production and distribution. \nTherefore,  a  GVC  is  a  collection  of  numerous  producers/suppliers,  distributors,  and \nbusiness service providers. Figure 1 below illustrates the process of a GVC and how raw \nmaterials  are  converted  into  a  final  product,  and  also  the  distribution  process  of  final \nproducts.  \n\nAs  Abe  (2015)  has  highlighted,  there  are  three  key  drivers  of  GVCs:  (1)  resource \nendowments;  (2)  market  access;  and  (3)  efficiency  maximization.  The  resource \nendowment may include advanced infrastructure, land, and other limited resources, low-\ncost  labor,  and  locational  benefits  (Feenstra  1998;  Kimura  and  Ando  2005).  As \nChristopher (2011) emphasized, efficiency maximization includes supply chain concepts \nsuch as just-in-time movement of goods, zero inventory, outsourcing and offshoring, and \nproduction agglomeration  (Ronkainen, Halsall,  and  Heineman 2010;  Kotler  and Keller \n2011).  As  Abe  (2015)  elaborated,  factors  such  as  low  entry  barriers,  an  enabling \nbusiness  environment,  symmetric  distribution  of  market  information,  and  advanced \nlogistic systems are crucial to ensure better market access.  \n\nAbe (2015), ESCAP (2009), and Gereffi, Humphrey, and Sturgeon (2005) identified four \nmain  types  of  GVCs:  (1)  an  international  supply  market  that  requires  minimal \nrelationships  among  buyers  and  sellers  and  where  transactions  are  made  between \nbuyers  and  sellers  across  borders;  (2)  international  supply  markets  where  leading \nproducers  have  the  controlling  power  over  the  international  network  of  subsidiaries, \naffiliates,  and  suppliers;  (3)  a  buyer-driven  network  where  large  retailers,  brand \nmanufacturers, and marketers play the central role in the GVC; and (4) integrated firms \nwhere hierarchical governance systems are implemented and produce all major products \nin-house.  \n\n \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1153 \n \n\nDeyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n\nFigure 1: The Process of a Global Value Chain \n\nSource: Abe (2015). \n\n \n\nSmall  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  play  a  crucial  role  in  each  and  every \neconomy irrespective of their development status. SMEs\u2019 contributions to the economy \nare  multidimensional  and  output  growth,  employment  generation,  poverty  alleviation, \neconomic  empowerment,  and  export  growth  can  be  considered  among  them  (Harvie \n2002; Asasen, Asasen, and Chuangcham 2003). As Abe et al. (2012) indicated, SMEs \naccount for more than 95% of private enterprises in Asia and have generated more than \n50% of employment. In Sri Lanka in particular, as of 2014, SMEs made up nearly 90% \nof  enterprises  (over  1  million  SMEs),  contributed  52%  to  the  country\u2019s  GDP,  and \nproduced 45% of its employment. \n\nTable 1: Number of Persons Engaged and Percentage Distribution  \nof SMEs in Economic Sectors \n\nPeople Engaged \n\nSector-wise Distribution (percentages) \n\nScale of the \nEstablishment \nTotal  \nMicro  \nSmall  \nMedium-sized  \nLarge  \n\nNo. \n3,003,119 \n1,338,675 \n529,751 \n386,756 \n747,937 \n\n% \n100 \n\n44.6 \n17.6 \n12.9 \n24.9 \n\nIndustry \n100 \n\n29.7 \n14.0 \n16.7 \n39.6 \n\nTrade \n100 \n\n68.1 \n16.8 \n5.5 \n9.5 \n\nService \n100 \n\n44.6 \n22.6 \n13.9 \n18.9 \n\nNote: The definitions of types of SMEs are provided in Table 2. \n\nSource: Created by authors based on Ministry of Industry and Commerce (2016). \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1153 \n \n\nDeyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n\nTable 1 indicates the number of people engaged in each type of SME and the sector-\nwise percentage distribution of SMEs. The total number employed in the micro scale is \n1.3 million, which is 45% of the total, although the micro scale represented almost 92% \nof  the  establishments.  The  large-scale  business  sector  represents  almost  25%  of  the \nemployment, although it accounts for only 0.2% of the establishments.  \n\nCountries define SMEs based on different bases and dimensions and therefore different \ncountries have different definitions of SMEs. In the United States (US), the definition of \nSMEs varies by industry as well. SMEs in the manufacturing sector should have 500 or \nless  employees,  while  in  trade  and  wholesale  sectors  there  should  be  100  or  less \nemployees. In contrast, SMEs in the mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sectors \nare eligible to have up to 1500 employees while SMEs in silver ore mining can have 250 \nemployees (Ward 2018). The Industry of Canada (2017) identified four types of SMEs \nbased on the number of employees. Industries with 1\u20124, 5\u201299, and 100\u2012499 employees \nare defined as micro, small, and medium-sized industries while industries with more than \n500  are  considered  large  industries.  The  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  has \nconsidered the number of employees, annual revenue, and assets in defining SMEs. In \nthe EU, a similar system is used to define small to medium-sized enterprises. A business \nwith  a  headcount  of  fewer  than  250  is  classified  as  medium-sized,  a  business  with  a \nheadcount of fewer than 50 is classified as small, and a business with a headcount of \nfewer  than  10  is  considered  a  microbusiness.  The  European  system  also  takes  into \naccount  a  business\u2019s  turnover  rate  and  its  balance  sheet.  In  fact,  the  European \nCommission considers three dimensions, namely the number of employees, the annual \nturnover, and the total balance sheet, in classifying SMEs (European Commission 2005).  \n\nHowever, it is crucial to focus on the Sri Lankan definition of SMEs as the current study \nis based on SMEs in Sri Lanka. As indicated in Table 2, Sri Lanka has also considered \ntwo  dimensions,  namely  the  number  of  employees  and  annual  turnover,  in  order  to \nclassify SMEs into micro, small, and medium-sized categories. Under the present SME \npolicy framework in Sri Lanka, SMEs are defined based on the number of employees \nand annual turnover. In order to qualify as an SME, an enterprise must employ less than \n300 people and generate an annual turnover of less than USD LKR 4.41 million.  \n\nCompany \nCategory \nMicro \nSmall \nMedium-sized \n\nTable 2: SME Classification in Sri Lanka \n\nManufacturing Sector \n\nService Sector \n\nNumber of \nEmployees \n1\u201210 \n11\u201250 \n51\u2012300 \n\nAnnual Turnover \n(Million) \n\u2264 LKR 15 \n\u2264 LKR 16\u2012250 \n\u2264 LKR 251\u2012750 \n\nNumber of \nEmployees \n1\u201210 \n11\u201250 \n51\u2012200 \n\nAnnual Turnover \n(Million) \n\u2264 LKR 15 \n\u2264 LKR 16\u2012250 \n\u2264 LKR 251\u2012750 \n\nSource: Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Sri Lanka (2002). \n\nSri  Lanka  has  also  identified  slightly  different  thresholds  in  terms  of  the  number  of \nemployees for manufacturing and service sectors. The current study applied the SME \nclassification indicated in Table 2.  \n\n1.2  Problem Statement and Objectives \n\nThe  national  policy  adopted  to  promote  SME  development  was  documented  by  the \nMinistry of Industry and Commerce in 2016. The idea for this took root in 2002 with the \nlaying down of a white paper by a task force comprising government officials, business \nleaders, and members of chambers and industry. Their vision was to help SMEs to be \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1153 \n \n\nDeyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n\nglobally competitive through fostering an entrepreneurial culture and adopting socially \nand environmentally sustainable practices. The intervention strategies of the policy are \nillustrated  by  Figure  2A  (left).  According  to  this  figure,  factors  such  as  an  enabling \nenvironment, access to research and development, an entrepreneurial culture, skills and \ndevelopment,  access  to  finance,  and  market  facilitation  have  been  recognized  as  the \ndeterminants of sustainable SME development.  \n\nFigure 2: Policy Intervention Strategies \n\nA \n\nB \n\nSource: Ministry of Industry and Commerce (2016). \n\nSource: Modified by authors based on Ministry of Industry \nand Commerce (2016). \n\n \n\n \n\nHowever,  the  policy  has  not  included  the  impact  of  linking  with  GVCs,  which  affects \nsustainable SME development and all the other five dimensions in Figure 2A (on the left). \nIn  fact,  linking  with  GVCs  has  become  a  novel  concept  for  most  SMEs  in  \nSri Lanka. Thus, the impact of GVCs on SMEs has not been considered by either policy \nmakers or researchers. Under this scenario, the current study examines the impact of \nGVCs  on \nin  Uva  and  central  provinces  of  \nSri Lanka. Accordingly, Figure 2A can be changed by incorporating the impact of GVCs \nas  illustrated  in  Figure  2B  on  the  right.  Hence,  the  study  aims  to  provide  appropriate \nsuggestions and policy implications to enrich the existing SME Development Strategic \nPlan  in  Sri  Lanka  while  highlighting  the  benefits  of  getting  involved  with  GVCs.  The \nspecific objectives of the study are as follows.  \n\nthe  performance  of  SMEs \n\n1.  To  recognize  and  profile  the  SMEs  in  Uva  and  the  central  provinces  of  \n\n2.

LITERATURE REVIEW \n\n2.1  Challenges faced by SMEs in Sri Lanka \n\nA  large number  of empirical studies have  identified  key challenges  faced  by  SMEs  in \ngeneral.  However,  a  study  performed  by  the  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC) \nobserved  that  77%  of  Sri  Lankan  SMEs  out  of  all  the  SMEs  included  in  the  study \nhighlighted the need for medium- and long-term loans for their businesses. Among them \nonly 53% of SME holders had access to bank loans and out of this 53%, only 29% of \nSMEs successfully secured their financial requirements (Nanayakkara 2011). However, \nAttygalle et al. (2014) argued that the government has formed special banks such as the \nLankaputhra Development Bank to provide loans for SMEs while other banks such as \nthe  People\u2019s  Bank,  Sanasa  Bank,  and  Regional  Development  Bank  \nalso provide such loan schemes. In contrast, Gamage (2003) highlighted that SMEs face \nsevere difficulties in accessing loans as banks and financial institutions ask for heavy \ncollateral  and  also  charge  higher  interest  rates.  Abeyratne  (2006)  conducted  \na  survey  in  Monaragala  district  in  order  to  analyze  the  key  challenges  faced  by  \nSMEs. The study identified 27% of SME holders in Monaragala district as having been \nnegatively affected by unsupportive government policies. In contrast, only 16% of SMEs \nin Monaragala district mentioned any financial difficulties faced by them. This is mainly \ndue  to  the  availability  of  informal  financial  institutions  that  provide  loans  without  any \ncollateral with repayment collected on a daily or weekly basis. However, interest rates \nattached to these loan schemes are extremely high and the borrowers do not even know \nthe  interest  rate.  In  addition  to  financial  constraints  highlighted  by  the  authors, \nnonfinancial barriers such as a lack of technology and managerial skills also hinder the \nefficiency and performance of SMEs. \n\nIn fact, most SMEs perform at the micro and medium level and have not linked up with \nhigh-tech industries and value chains. Similarly, Esim (2001) pointed out that SMEs in \nSri Lanka do not receive updated information about market opportunities and marketing \nskills.  Esim  (2001)  further  highlighted  that  in  addition  to  the  lack  of  access  to  market \nopportunities, SMEs in Sri Lanka also suffer from insufficient know-how to market their \nproducts in domestic and international markets.  \n\nAs Athukorala (2017) highlighted, one of the key issues in Sri Lanka is the absence of a \nclear  policy  that  a  typical  small  or  medium-scale  entrepreneur  can use  as  a guide.  In \nThailand, there was an SME promotional plan and in the Philippines there was an SME \ndevelopment  plan  launched  with  aggressive  field  administration.  ASEAN  got  together \nand  launched  a  blueprint  for  ASEAN  SMEs  that  got  traction,  but  Sri  Lanka  could  \nnot latch on to this. Athukorala (2017) further stressed that it would take approximately \n258  days  to  complete  the  business  registration  process  together  with  a  cost  of  5%  \nof  the  land  value,  which  is  not  conducive  to  fostering  entrepreneurship.  The  lack  of \nbusiness  development  services,  inadequate  research  and  development  facilities,  the \nlack of quality certification at district level, and the linkage to export markets not being \nreadily  available  come  up  as  key  issues  whilst  the  biggest  issue  is  the  difficulty  \nin  gaining  access  to  concessionary  finance.  Another  point  highlighted  by  Athukorala \n(2017) is that SMEs pay on average 28 types of taxes, which are highly complex and \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1153 \n \n\nDeyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n\ntime-consuming. Similarly to Athukorala (2017), Priyanath and Premaratne (2014) also \ncriticized the policy framework related to SMEs in Sri Lanka.  \n\nThe government SME development programs do not help SMEs to access sufficient and \nreliable  information  that  leads  to  more  rational  decision-making,  to  safeguarding \ntransactions from opportunism, and to selecting a suitable governance mechanism. SME \ndevelopment programs have neglected to support formal governance; as a result, there \nis a high possibility that SMEs in Sri Lanka have greater transaction costs, which impedes \nthe growth of SMEs (Priyanath and Premaratne 2014). Vijayakumar (2013) highlighted \nthat there is only very poor growth in SMEs, in terms of mean value of assets, value of \nturnover, and mean value of number of employees as well as growth stages of SMEs. \nThe Central Bank Annual Report of 2016 cites a World Bank study that states that firms \naged  25  years  or  more  are  only  50%\u201290%  larger  than  firms  less  than  five  years  old. \nVision 2025 has identified several steps to address this problem, such as gradation of \nmicroenterprises to SMEs. These will include: introducing policies to increase project-\nbased  lending  vs.  collateral-based  lending;  removing  taxes  that  prevent  expansion; \nencouraging knowledge sharing between SMEs and R&D institutions; enhancing brand \nvalue; increasing access to markets and access to credit. The ultimate aim is to integrate \nSMEs into the formal sector. The key policy challenge is translating vision into policy and \npractice. \n\n2.2  Impact of Linking with GVCs on SME Development \n\nthat. \n\nbeyond \n\nTherefore, \n\nrestructuring \n\nDuring  the  past  few  years,  the  organization  of  production  has  undergone  significant \nchanges with its extension to the global platform. GVCs have influenced the production \nprocess, which is determined by sourcing inputs from lower sources of suppliers, finding \nmore  opportunities  in  new  marketplaces,  and  available  strategic  partnership  options \n(OECD 2007). Extending SMEs into GVCs is not just a matter of internationalization but \ngoes \nproduction  \nlevel at the global level is more essential for SMEs, especially in expanding their business \nopportunities and market outreach. It is a fact that cross-border business activities are \nchallenging and a costly step for SMEs. Most SMEs claim that insufficient resources and \ncapabilities, and inadequate self-confidence in reaching out to international markets are \nmajor  obstacles  to  touching  the  global  business  atmosphere.  Furthermore,  grasping \nforeign  business  opportunities,  maintaining  control  over  foreign  intermediaries,  and \naccessing  export  distribution  channels  are  also  challenging  for  SMEs  (OECD  2007). \nAlthough  there are  a  few  obstacles,  overcoming  them and  participating  in  GVCs may \nbring possible benefits to SMEs. Enterprises that have successfully integrated into one \nor more value chains have been able to obtain stability or expand their businesses. It is \nevident  that  participation  in  the  activities  of  GVCs  can  produce  benefits  for  domestic \neconomies (OECD 2012). \n\nthe \n\nParticipation in GVCs provides opportunities to suppliers and individuals to acquire new \ncompetencies  and  skills.  The  trade,  investment,  and  knowledge  flows  that  underpin \nGVCs lead to fast learning, innovation, and industrial upgrading. GVCs have provided \ninstantaneous  access  to  new  information,  opening  up  new  market  opportunities  \nand  bringing  a  technological  learning  atmosphere  through  linked  transactions  and \ninvestments. Local enterprises can enhance their performance in their own markets by \ncombining  national  and  international  intermediate  inputs,  and  by  creating  economies  \nof  specialization  that  can  leverage  cross-border  complementarities  and  allow  the \nenterprises to benefit from knowledge and technology spillovers (OECD 2012). \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1153 \n \n\nDeyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n\nYuhua and Bayhaqi (2013) highlighted the benefits to SMEs of macro- and micro-level \nparticipation in global production networks, which include: (1) enhancement of technical \ncapacity;  (2)  increased  demand  for  existing  products  and  services  leading  to  optimal \nutilization of production capacity and improvement of production efficiency; (3) enabling \nSMEs  to  raise  equity  finance  from  foreign  investors  and  acquire  competent  human \nresources through prestige and credibility created through the global production network; \n(4) uncovering a steady and sustainable way to enter into internationalization, which may \nnot  be  impossible  for  SMEs.  Moreover,  according  to  Yuhua  and  Bayhaqi  (2013), \nparticipation of SMEs in global production networks may provide benefits, such as: (1) \nfast-growing  economies  identify  SME  sectors  as  one  of  the  positive  and  influencing \nfactors in economic growth; (2) GVCs create a number of job opportunities for the local \ncommunity;  (3)  SMEs  can  expand  their  exports  to  foreign  markets  and  allow  them  to \ncreate  a  tank  of  foreign  reserves  that  is  necessary  for  the  growth  of  developing \neconomies; (4) consequently GVCs provide a solid platform for the sustainable economic \ngrowth  and  development  of  local  economies  and  businesses  through  SME  sector \nparticipation.  \n\nHowever, no studies have been conducted to examine the impact of GVCs on SMEs in \nSri  Lanka.  The  current  study  believes  that  incorporating  with  GVCs  will  be  crucial  to \novercome  the  highlighted  challenges  related  to  the  Sri  Lankan  SME  industry.  Since  \nno  previous  studies  have  systematically  addressed  the  impact  of  GVCs  on  SMEs  \nin  Sri  Lanka,  the  present  study  attempts  to  fill  the  gaps  in  both  the  literature  and  \npolicy framework. \n\n3.  METHODOLOGY \n\n3.1  Study Area and Data Collection Procedures \n\nThe  study  mainly  focuses  on  four  districts  (Badulla,  Monaragal,  Matale,  and  Nuwara \nEliya)  located  in  Uva  and  the  central  provinces.  In  particular,  the  selected  districts \nrepresent  rural  and  estate  sectors  where  most  of  the  lower-income  groups  and \nmarginalized  groups  are  located.  Moreover,  the  government  has  started  a  special \nprogram to enhance the profile of the SMEs in both Uva and the central provinces in \norder to reduce poverty through providing better employment opportunities. Moreover, \ndistricts such as Colombo and Gampaha located in the western province feature both \nmedium- and large-scale industries rather than SMEs. Furthermore, it is easy to find two \ngroups, one that engaged with GVCs and one that did not, in both Uva and the central \nprovinces  and  this  allows  the  impacts  of  GVCs  on  SMEs\u2019  performance  across  both \ngroups to be compared.  \n\nThe  study  will  be  mainly  based  on  primary  data,  although  it  is  expected  that  some \nsecondary  data  will  be  collected  from  the  desk  review.  The  proposed  study  uses  the \nfollowing data collection tools to collect required data. \n\n1.  Enterprise survey with SME holders \n\n2.  Focus group discussions (FGDs) \n\n3.  Key informant interviews (KIIs) \n\nTable  3  elaborates  the  data  collection  procedure  in  detail.  The  study  collected  \nrelevant  quantitative  data  from  329  SME  holders  located  across  the  four  districts  of  \ntwo provinces by applying the snowball sampling technique. Moreover, four FGDs and \neight KIIs were also conducted to collect qualitative data required for the study.  \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1153 \n \n\nDeyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n\nTable 3: Details of the Survey, FGDs, and KIIs \n\nFGDs \n\nKIIs \n\nProvinces \nUva Province  Badulla \n\nDistricts \n\nNo. of Divisional \nSecretariat Divisions \nDS 1 \nDS 2 \nDS 3 \nDS 4 \nDS 5 \nDS 1 \nDS 2 \nDS 3 \nDS 4 \nDS 5 \nDS 1 \nDS 2 \nDS 3 \nDS 4 \nDS 5 \nDS 1 \nDS 2 \nDS 3 \nDS 4 \nDS 5 \n\nTotal \n18 \n18 \n15 \n18 \n15 \n17 \n17 \n16 \n19 \n12 \n18 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n16 \n19 \n16 \n23 \n12 \n15 \n329 \n\n \n \n \n \nMonaragala \n \n \n \n \nMatale \n \n \n \n \nNuwara Eliya \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1 \n\n1 \n\n1 \n\n1 \n\n4 \n\n2 \n\n2 \n\n2 \n\n2 \n\n8 \n\nCentral \nProvince \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nSource: Created by authors. \n\n3.2  Data Analysis  \n\nBoth econometric and descriptive analyses are incorporated to accomplish the objectives \nof the study. Moreover, qualitative information collected through FGDs and KIIs is used \nto validate the quantitative findings and also to provide in-depth analysis on GVC and \nSME development in the context of Sri Lanka.  \n\nEconometric Analysis \n\nAn econometric analysis was employed to quantify the impact of engaging with GVCs \non SME development. The following empirical model was estimated to accomplish the \nmain objectives of the study. The empirical model is aligned with the econometric model \nused by Vidavong (2019) in the context of Lao PDR and also empirical studies by Dikova \net al. (2015) and Biesebroeck (2005). Logarithmic values of all continuous variables were \ntaken to reduce unnecessary variation of the variables. Similarly, profits of firms  were \nconsidered as a proxy for the performance of SMEs. Moreover, a dummy variable was \nassigned to measure the impacts of GVCs on SMEs\u2019 performance as the dummy variable \nallows  comparison  of  the  impacts  across  two  groups  \u2012  SMEs  that  are  engaged  with \nGVCs and SMEs not engaged with GVCs.  \n\n\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd0 + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd1\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd2(\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 \u00d7 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd3(\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 \u00d7 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd4(\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 \u00d7\n\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd5\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd6\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd7\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd8\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd9\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd10\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 +\n\ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd11\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd12\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\n\nThe variables indicated in the empirical model are explained in Table 4 below.  \n\n  \n\n(1) \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1153 \n \n\nDeyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n\nTable 4: Operationalization and Explanation of Variables  \n\nVariable Name \nProfit \nGVC \n\nlnSL \nlnTR \nlnRD \nlnK \nlnL \nlnHC \nlnAGE \nTYPE \n\nExplanation \n\nAnnual profit of the firm after tax  \nDummy variable for global value chain \nGVC = 1 for SMEs that are engaged in GVC \nGVC = 0 for SMEs that are not engaged in GVC \nLog of annual sales revenue \nLog of number of employees who are trained annually  \nLog of share of R&D expenditure in total revenue \nLog of total capital of the firm \nLog of number of workers \nLog of the level of education of SME holder \nLog of age of SME holder \nDummy variable for type of SME \nTYPE = 1 for small \nTYPE = 0 for otherwise (medium and large) \n\nExpected Sign \n\n \nPositive when GVC = 1 \n\nPositive \nPositive \nPositive \nPositive \nPositive \nPositive \nPositive \nNegative when TYPE = 1 \n\nSource: Created by authors. \n\nSummary  statistics  related  to  each  variable  (without  logarithm)  are  presented  in  \nTable 5 below.  \n\nTable 5: Summary Statistics of Variables  \n\nVariables \nProfit \nGVC \nSL \nTR \nRD \nK \nL \nHC \nAGE \n\nUnits of Variables \n\nSri Lankan Rupee \nDummy Variable \nSri Lanka Rupee \nNumber of Employees \nSri Lanka Rupee \nSri Lanka Rupee \nNumber of Employees \nYears of Schooling \nYears \n\nNumber of \nObservations \n329 \n329 \n329 \n329 \n329 \n329 \n329 \n329 \n329 \n\nMaximum \n275,000 \n1 \n552,402 \n120 \n120,000 \n120,0000 \n375 \n19 \n69 \n\nMinimum \n17,500 \n0 \n39,142 \n1 \n15,000 \n95,000 \n2 \n1 \n20 \n\nMean \n185,000 \n0.49 \n209,231 \n24 \n35,000 \n1 \n68 \n13 \n52 \n\nSource: Created by authors based on survey data. \n\nIn addition to the econometric analysis, a descriptive analysis is also utilized in support \nof the objectives of the research.  \n\n4.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n4.1  Profiling the SMEs in Uva and the Central Provinces  \n\nof Sri Lanka \n\nProfiling the identified enterprises in four districts is important in order to understand the \nsalient  features  and  composition  of  SMEs.  This  allows  for  a  comprehensive \nunderstanding of existing SMEs, which in turn enables evaluation of their performance, \nlimitations, challenges, etc. Therefore, this section profiles the SMEs based on gender, \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1153 \n \n\nDeyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n\nage structure, educational attainment of the entrepreneurs, source of capital, average \nmonthly income of the SMEs, and number of workers employed. \n\nSMEs\u2019 Participation in GVCs and Profit of SMEs \n\nThe  SMEs  that  export  their  products  or  services  as  a  final  or  intermediate  product  \nor  service  are  considered  to  be  SMEs  participating  in  GVCs.  Enumerators  asked \nrespondents whether they engage with such a process and accordingly the respondents \nwere classified as GVC or non-GVC SMEs. Table 6 clearly indicates the percentage and \nnumber of SMEs that are classified as GVC and non-GVC SMEs across four districts.  \n\nTable 6: Distribution of GVC and Non-GVC SMEs across the Districts \n\nDistricts \nBadulla \nMonaragala \nMatale \nNuwara Eliya \n\nGVC \n35 (41.7%) \n28 (34.6%) \n51 (64.6%) \n47 (55.3%) \n\nNon-GVC \n49 (58.3%) \n53 (65.4%) \n28 (35.4%) \n38 (44.7%) \n\nTotal \n84 (100%) \n81 (100%) \n79 (100%) \n85 (100%) \n\nSource: Calculated by authors based on enterprise survey. \n\nAccording to Table 6, Matale and Nuwara Eliya districts are the districts where more than \n50%  of  SMEs  engage  with  GVCs.  In  particular,  64.6%  and  55.3%  of  SMEs  \nin  Matale  and  Nuwara  Eliya,  respectively,  engage  with  GVCs.  However,  SME \nparticipation  in  GVCs  is  significantly  lower  in  both  Badulla  (41.7%)  and  Monaragal \n(34.6%) than in Matale and Nuwara Eliya. In fact, Badulla and Monaragala districts are \nextremely remote and lack infrastructure, information, and financial facilities compared \nto the other two districts considered.  \n\nFurthermore, profit is the key variable and was assigned as the dependent variable of \nthe model. The profit was calculated by subtracting the cost of all inputs and taxes from \nsales  revenue.  Figure  3  compares  the  average  monthly  profit  of  GVC  and  non-GVC \nSMEs across four districts. The figure clearly shows that SMEs linked with GVCs achieve \na higher average profit than non-GVC SMEs. In general, SMEs in Matale district achieve \nthe highest average profit followed by Monaragala. Interestingly, the average profit levels \nof  SMEs  that  are  engaged  in  GVCs  are considerably  higher  than  that  of  the  average \nprofit for SMEs in all four districts, which is Rs. 178,125.  \n\nFigure 3: Average Monthly Profit of SMEs in Four Districts (in Sri Lankan rupees) \n\nSource: Created by authors based on enterprise survey. \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1153 \n \n\nDeyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n\nMoreover, as Figure 3 illustrates, the difference in profit of both GVC and non-GVC SMEs \nis  more substantial  in  Matale  and Badulla  districts while  Nuwara  Eliya  district  has  the \nlowest profit related to GVC SMEs.  \n\nGender Composition of SME Holders \n\nFigure  4  depicts  the  gender  composition  of  SMEs  in  the  four  districts  of  Uva  and  the \ncentral provinces. On average, the number of female entrepreneurs is lower than that of \nmales  and  this  trend  is  more  pronounced  in  Nuwara  Eliya  district,  where  our  survey \ncaptured only 17 female-headed SMEs (20%) as compared to 68 SMEs run by males. \nIn  fact,  the  majority  of  women  in  Nuwara  Eliya  district  are  employed  in  the  plantation \nsector,  where  there  are  only  limited  opportunities  for  them  to  become  entrepreneurs. \nHowever, the gender gap in SME ownership is comparatively low in both Monaragala \nand  Badulla  districts  where  39  (48.1%)  and  35  (41.7%)  SMEs,  respectively,  are  run  \nby females.  \n\nFigure 4: Gender Composition of SMEs in Four Districts \n\nSource: Created by authors based on enterprise survey. \n\n \n\nAccording to the survey results, in the Badulla district, the majority of agriculture-based \nSMEs (72.0%) are run by males while the majority of industry-based SMEs are run by \nfemales (56.8%). However, an opposite trend is seen in Monaragala, where a majority \nof females operate agriculture-based micro SMEs (53.3%), while the majority of industrial \nSMEs are run by males (54.9%). In contrast, the gender composition for SMEs in the \nNuwara  Eliya  district  is  extremely  male-skewed  and  the  majority  of  SMEs  in  all  three \nsectors  (agriculture,  industry,  and  service)  are  owned  by  males  while  the  proportion \nheaded by females is very low.  \n\nTable 7 indicates that according to the survey findings, 62.3% of businesses are run by \nmales while only 37.7% are owned by females, thereby showing a significant gender gap \nin the four districts.  \n\n \n\n \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1153 \n \n\nDeyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n\nTable 7: Gender Composition of SMEs by Type of Business \n\nType of Business \nAgriculture, farming, and dairy \nArts and crafts \nApparel and bags \nAuto parts and maintenance \nFood and beverages \nHotels and homestay \nCement and metalwork \nFurniture \nSalons and spas \nHousehold items \nOther \nTotal \n\nFemale \n\nMale \n\nTotal \n\n27 \n8 \n39 \n1 \n23 \n5 \n9 \n4 \n2 \n4 \n2 \n124 \n\n(27.3%) \n(23.5%) \n(70.9%) \n(12.5%) \n(40.4%) \n(35.7%) \n(37.5%) \n(33.3%) \n(28.6%) \n(57.1%) \n(16.7%) \n(37.7%) \n\nSex \n\n72 \n26 \n16 \n7 \n34 \n9 \n15 \n8 \n5 \n3 \n10 \n205 \n\n(72.7%) \n(76.5%) \n(29.1%) \n(87.5%) \n(59.6%) \n(64.3%) \n(62.5%) \n(66.7%) \n(71.4%) \n(42.9%) \n(83.3%) \n(62.3%) \n\n99 \n34 \n55 \n8 \n57 \n14 \n24 \n12 \n7 \n7 \n12 \n329 \n\nSource: Created by author based on enterprise survey. \n\nAge Structure of SME Holders \n\nTable 8 summarizes the age composition of SME holders in the four districts based on \nthe main economic sectors. It is apparent from the table that the average age of SME \nholders  is  between  40  and  50  for  any  type  of  SME.

Three  models  were estimated  by  adding  independent \nvariables gradually in order to check the robustness of the relationship between GVCs \nand the profit of SMEs.  \n\nThe key variable, GVC, and another three independent variables, namely capital, labor, \nand human capital, were included in model 1. Model 2 incorporated additional variables \nsuch  as sales  revenue,  number  of  annually  trained  workers,  expenditure  on  research \nand  development,  age  of  the  firm,  and  type  of  SME.  Finally,  the  third  model  can  be \nconsidered  the  complete  model,  which  measures  both  direct  and  indirect  impacts  of \nGVCs  on  the  profit  of  SMEs  along  with  the  impacts  of  other  characteristics  of  firms. \nSpecifically, interaction terms included in the third model estimate the indirect effect of \nGVCs through the sale revenue, training, and research and development of firms.  \n\nIt is worth highlighting that the estimated coefficients for GVCs in all three models are \npositive  and  statistically  significant  at  the  1%  level.  This  implies  that  SMEs  that  have \nengaged with GVCs achieve a higher profit than SMEs that have not. Specifically, this \nrelationship is consistent even when the models are controlled by other characteristics \nof firms. In fact, SMEs that have engaged with GVCs have a higher potential to enhance \ncompetitiveness,  productivity,  and  also  economies  of  scale  while  reducing  production \ncosts. Moreover, GVCs allow SMEs to link with a broader network in the international \nbusiness arena, which is crucial for SMEs that are in the growing stage. Scholars such \nas  Harvie,  Narjoko,  and  Oum  (2010),  Yuhua  (2014),  and  Arudchelvan  and  Wignaraja \n(2015) also indicated that SMEs participating in GVCs can increase their profit through \nhigher  competitiveness  and  production  cost  efficiency.  Moreover,  Pietrobelli  and \nRabellotti (2011) confirmed that GVCs benefit SMEs through production expansions and \n\n1   This observation is supported by the estimated VIF being 4.46 from the regression in Table 12, while the \n\ncommonly agreed threshold for the presence of multicollinearity is greater than 10. \n\n \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1153 \n \n\nDeyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n\nnew information, and in turn the profit of SMEs also increases. Therefore, it is apparent \nfrom the estimated results that engaging with GVCs essentially increases the profit of \nSMEs in Sri Lanka, which ensures future development of such SMEs.  \n\nTable 12: Impact of GVC on Performance of SMEs  \n\nVariable Name \nGVC \n\nlnK \n\nlnL \n\nlnHC \n\nlnSL \n\nlnTR \n\nlnRD \n\nlnAGE \n\nTYPE \n\nGVC x lnSL \n\nGVC x lnTR \n\nGVC x lnRD \n\nConstant \n\nModel 1 \n0.8091*** \n(0.1321) \n0.7732*** \n(0.2124) \n0.2341*** \n(0.0814) \n0.0813** \n(0.0387) \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nModel 2 \n0.7863*** \n(0.2314) \n0.6352** \n(0.2931) \n0.2031** \n(0.0987) \n0.0736** \n(0.0352) \n0.8056** \n(0.2787) \n0.0245** \n(0.0109) \n0.0223* \n(0.0116) \n0.8201 \n(0.8971) \n\u20130.1897*** \n(0.0621) \n \n\n \n\n \n\nModel 3 \n0.7231*** \n(0.2256) \n0.6733** \n(0.3167) \n0.2122** \n(0.0923) \n0.0675 \n(0.1064) \n0.7863** \n(0.3848) \n0.0271 \n(0.0324) \n0.0127 \n(0.0267) \n0.7861 \n(0.9171) \n\u20130.2787** \n(0.1072) \n0.2018** \n(0.0827) \n0.0626 \n(0.7871) \n0.0876** \n(0.0372) \n6.6371*** \n(0.8761) \n329 \n0.7762 \n0.0000 \n\nNumber of Observations \nR2 \nProb on F \n\n12.7161*** \n(0.9781) \n329 \n0.4582 \n0.0000 \n\n8.8971*** \n(0.8181) \n329 \n0.5672 \n0.0000 \n\n*** 1% significance level, ** 5% significance level, * 10% significance level. \n\nNote: Standard errors are in parentheses. \n\nSource: Estimated by authors. \n\nApart from the direct impact of GVCs, the indirect effects of GVCs are also taken into \naccount by incorporating interaction terms. As model 3 indicates, both interaction terms \n\u2013 (GVC x lnSL) and (GVC x lnRD) \u2012 have a positive coefficient and are also statistically \nsignificant at the 5% level. This reflects the fact that SMEs that have engaged with GVCs \nhave higher sales revenue and research and development capabilities than those that \nhave not. Therefore, GVCs increase the profit of Sri Lankan SMEs through enhancing \nsales  revenue  and  research  and  development  activities  and  this  is  in  line  with  the \nempirical findings of Vidavong (2019).  \n\nIn addition to the key findings, the estimated models also confirm that factors such as \ncapital assets, number of workers, and sales revenue of firms also positively affect the \nprofit of SMEs. More specifically, a 1% increase in capital and labor may increase the \nprofit of the SMEs considered by 0.67% and 0.21%, respectively. Human capital has also \nbeen recognized as a factor in the profit of SMEs when the model is not controlled for \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1153 \n \n\nDeyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n\ninteraction  terms.  In  addition,  considering  the  estimated  coefficient  for  the  variable \n\u201cTYPE\u201d  (\u20130.2787),  it  is  apparent  that  the  profits  of  small-scale  SMEs  are  significantly \nlower  than  those  of  medium-  and  large-scale  SMEs.  The  estimated  models  are \nstatistically significant at the 1% level overall and also have a higher R2 value in model 3 \n(0.7762), representing a higher level of goodness of fit.  \n\n4.3  Recognizing Potential Local Business Sectors  \n\nand Their Intention to Link with GVCs \n\nPotential Local Business Sectors \n\nIt is recognized that Sri Lanka has only a limited number of SMEs that have linked with \nGVCs. However, there are numerous business sectors that have a higher potential to be \nlinked with GVCs. The study initially conducted KIIs with relevant experts in the field to \nexplore  business  sectors  that  can  be  easily  linked  with  GVCs.  Figure  6  indicates  the \nrecognized  business  sectors  that  can  be  connected  with  GVCs  and  the  figure  also \nillustrates the magnitude of the potential in relation to each recognized business sector \nbased on a five-point Likert scale.  \n\nFigure 6: Recognized Business Sectors and their Potential  \nto Be Linked with GVCs \n\nSource: Created by authors based on KIIs and survey. \n\n \n\nAccording to KIIs, five main business sectors, namely information technology, apparel, \ngems and minerals, tea and other agricultural products, and handcraft, were recognized \nas the sectors with the most potential. As Figure 6 illustrates, the information technology \nsector and the apparel sector seem to be the sectors with the highest potential for GVCs. \nMore  than  70%  of  the  respondents  confirmed  that  these  two  sectors  have  \u201chigher \npotential\u201d \nto  \n5% \nlink  with  GVCs.  Moreover,  68%  and  62%  of  the  respondents  mentioned  that  both  \ngems  and  minerals  and  tea  sectors,  respectively,  have  a  higher  potential  to  link  with \ninternational markets.  \n\npotential\u201d \n\nindicated \n\nwhile \n\nthan \n\nless \n\n\u201cno \n\n \n\n \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1153 \n \n\nDeyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n\nWe have the best gems and also a world-famous tea brand \u2013 Ceylon Tea. I don\u2019t \nthink we have capitalized on the opportunities that come from such world popular \nbrand names yet. In particular, tea should be promoted as a value-added product \nthat  can  be  easily  marketed  internationally.  Although  some  companies  have \nalready \navailable  \nample \nfor  new  firms  and  they  can  make  use  of  this  opportunities  to  get  into  GVCs. \n(Source: KII \u2013 01 \u2013 A Government Officer in Badulla District, 12/10/2019)  \n\nopportunities \n\nstarted, \n\nthere \n\nare \n\nstill \n\nIn addition to tea, other agricultural products such as organic fruits and vegetables, and \nvalue-added products such  as  banana chips  and  tomato  pulp  and sauce can  also  be \nlinked with GVCs. In particular, during the harvesting season bananas and tomatoes can \nbe stored at low cost and also fruit pulps and sauce can be prepared with the available \ntechnology  in  the  country.  These  semi-value-added  products  can  then  be  linked  with \nGVCs efficiently and ensure better earning opportunities for such entrepreneurs.  \n\nWe have more than 150 farmers and they produce high-quality cucumbers and \nbell peppers. They also use more advanced technology for their cultivation and \nalso  to  build  their  greenhouses.  Currently,  more  than  50%  of  the  output  of  \nour  organization  is  purchased  by  SriLankan  Catering  of  SriLankan  Airlines.  \nWe have the potential to double our capacity, if demand can be ensured. (Source: \nFGD  \u2012  02  \u2013  An  Organization  of  Greenhouse  Farmers  in  Badulla  District, \n14/10/2019) \n\nIt is apparent from the above statement that SMEs in the agricultural sector also have \nhigher potential to access GVCs. Moreover, the KIIs and survey also emphasized the \npotential to link handcraft-related SMEs to GVCs.  \n\nIntention of Potential Business Sectors to Link with GVCs \n\nThe study explores the intention of recognized business sectors to link with GVCs. Figure \n7 illustrates the level of intention of each business sector to link with GVCs. According to \nFigure 6, 69% of information technology-related SMEs and 67% of apparel-related SMEs \nreported that they have a \u201chigher intention\u201d related to linking with GVCs. In particular, \nSMEs  in  the  information  technology  sector  have  a  greater  intention  to  expand  their \nservices internationally and link with GVCs in order to achieve the benefits of a globalized \nworld.  Similarly,  the  garment  and  apparel  sector  in  which  Sri  Lanka  has  comparative \nadvantages compared to other regional counterparts has also been searching for global \nopportunities. In fact, their greater intention to link with GVCs is justifiable considering \nboth the quality of Sri Lankan apparel and the higher demand from international markets.  \n\nIn our district we have both human and physical resources required for garment \nand  apparel  industries.  We  have  a  good  and  efficient  supply  chain  in  a  local \nmarket and some medium-level garment factories export their production through \nintermediaries. Since we have the capacity, technology, and also skilled labor, \nwe  have  also  been  looking  for  some  opportunities  to  reach  the  global  market. \n(FGD \u2013 03 \u2013 An Owner of a Garment Factory in Monaragala District, 22/10/2019) \n\nIn addition, entrepreneurs in business sectors such as gems and minerals, and tea and \nother agricultural products have also shown a greater desire to engage with GVCs. More \nspecifically, 65%, 62%, and 60% of SME holders, respectively, in the gems and minerals, \nand  tea  and  other  agricultural  product  sectors  have  reported  that  they  have  higher \nintentions to link with GVCs.  \n\nFigure 7: Level of Intention of Business Sectors to Link with GVC \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1153 \n \n\nDeyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n\nSource: Created by authors based on KIIs and survey. \n\n \n\n4.4  Challenges and Key Success Factors Related to Coping \n\nwith GVCs \n\nChallenges Related to Linking with GVCs \n\nranked \n\nthese  challenges  based  on \n\nAlthough SMEs can earn ample benefits through joining GVCs, there are a number of \nbarriers that hinder SMEs\u2019 participation in GVCs. The current study recognized 10 main \nchallenges that SMEs face when they attempt to link with GVCs, and Figure 7 illustrates \nhow  SME  holders  have \ntheir  severity.  \nAs  Figure  8  shows,  a  lack  of  access  to  finance,  a  lack  of  technology,  and  a  lack  of \ninformation can be recognized as the three key challenges. More specifically, 42% of the \nrespondents who recognized a lack of access to finance as a challenge have marked it \nas a \u201csevere challenge\u201d while 34% have recognized it as a \u201cchallenge.\u201d Moreover, 40% \nand 34% of SME holders have recognized a lack of technology and a lack of information \nas \u201csevere challenges\u201d when expanding their business globally. In fact, access to finance \nhas been a critical issue in relation to expansion of SMEs even in the local market. Most \nof  the  government  and  private  commercial  banks  are  reluctant  to  provide  financial \nfacilities to SMEs, indicating that financing SMEs is a risk to banks. Furthermore, most \nof the microfinance institutions functioning in Sri Lanka have imposed higher but hidden \ninterest rates on their loans and consequently SMEs may end up in a debt trap.  \n\nI started this business using the inheritance from my parents. Now the business \nis running smoothly but I need financial support to expand this business further. \nI discussed this with a few banks and their procedures and standards are too high \nfor us to afford. Although microfinance institutions are willing to finance us, I know \ntheir interest rates are too high and a few of my fellow businessmen have had \nvery bad experiences with their loan schemes.

The  global  market  needs  high-quality  products  and  also  at  a \ncompetitive price. However, how can we increase quality and reduce production \ncosts when outdated technology is used? We don\u2019t even have cool room facilities \nto  store  fruits and  vegetables.  Hence,  there  should  be  a proper  and  long-term \nmechanism  to  enhance  technology  related  to  food  processing.  (Source:  SME \nholder, food processing, in Nuwara Eliya District, 23/10/2019) \n\nIn addition to the three key challenges, being unable to meet the quality standards of the \ninternational  market,  being  unable  to  meet  the  production  capacity  demanded  by  the \nglobal market, unpopularity of the product in the market, a lack of government support, \na lack of infrastructure, a lack of skilled labor, and legal barriers are also recognized as \nbarriers to SMEs going global. Among these challenges, being unable to meet the quality \nstandard and the quantity demanded by the international market are also mainly due to \na lack of technology. Hence, it is apparent that these challenges are linked with each \nother  and  therefore  the  final  impact  might  be  much  more  adverse  than  expected. \nFurthermore, it seems that government support has also not been sufficient to overcome \nthe challenges attached with SMEs. SMEs need to expand their business in the global \narena. In fact, the government of Sri Lanka has been implementing different strategies \nhighlighted in Section 1.1 in order to promote SMEs at national level. However, there is \nno \nrelation  \nto  linking  SMEs  with  GVCs.  Moreover,  there  is  a  lack  of  coordination  between \ngovernment policies, policy makers, and implementers. For instance, the recent policy \nformulation called \u201cEnterprise Sri Lanka\u201d was launched to provide low-interest rate loans \nfor SMEs through government commercial banks. However, the commercial banks still \navoid  providing  loans  to  SMEs,  saying  that  \u201cEnterprise  Sri  Lanka\u201d  has  not  been \nimplemented yet.  \n\nimplementation \n\nmechanism \n\nproper \n\npolicy \n\nor \n\nin \n\n \n\n20 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1153 \n \n\nDeyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n\nKey Success Factors Related to Joining GVCs  \n\nIn addition to the barriers related to joining GVCs, it is crucial to recognize key success \nfactors that stimulate the process of linking SMEs with GVCs. The survey conducted in \nthe current study recognized 12 success factors that every SME should focus on in order \nto  ensure  they  link  up  with  a  GVC.  Figure  9  indicates  all  recognized  success  factors \nalong with their level of importance.  \n\ntherefore \n\nAs Figure 9 visualizes, ensuring a higher level of quality, the availability of skilled labor, \nand access to better finance have become the most crucial success factors that can push \nSMEs into linking with GVCs. In particular, 64% of SME holders stressed that the quality \nof products was \u201cvery important\u201d while 62% equally recognized that having skilled labor \nand  better  access  to  finance  were  also  \u201cvery  important.\u201d  In  fact,  the  global  market  is \nhighly  competitive  and \nthe  quality  of  products  and  services  plays  \na  major  role  when  competing  with  homogeneous  products  from  different  countries. \nMoreover, most of the successful SMEs in Sri Lanka have better access to finance and \nalso  have  productive  and  skilled  workers.  Better  access  to  finance  fulfills  all  types  of \nfinancial  requirements  of  firms  while  skilled  labor  sustains  an  efficient  production \nprocess. In addition, access to better technologies and the ability to produce at low cost \nare also recognized as \u201cvery important\u201d by 58% and 53% of respondents, respectively. \nIn fact, technological improvements are always linked with the success of businesses in \ndifferent ways. On the one hand, advanced and appropriate technology plays a major \nrole in ensuring both quality and quantity of outputs, and on the other hand, technological \ndevelopment  makes  the  distribution  process  more  efficient.  Similarly,  the  ability  to \nproduce at low cost is also very important in order to compete with other suppliers in the \nglobal market. \n\nFigure 9: Key Success Factors that Promote SMEs\u2019 Link with GVCs  \n\nSource: Created by authors based on KIIs and Survey. \n\n \n\nMoreover, business development services (BDSs) also play a vital role when SMEs look \nfor global opportunities. BDSs enhance SMEs\u2019 awareness related to global opportunities \nwhile providing necessary guidance and instructions on the process of GVCs. Similarly, \nBDSs  generate  networking  opportunities  for  SMEs  at  both  local  and  global  levels. \n\n21 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1153 \n \n\nDeyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n\nTherefore, according to the findings of the survey, 51% and 34% of SME holders have \nreported that access to BDSs is \u201cvery important\u201d and \u201cimportant,\u201d respectively.  \n\nActually, the BDS given by \u2026\u2026\u2026 organization was highly important for me to \nmake my business more successful. They enriched us in many aspects such as \nhow  to  register  a  business,  how  to  access  financial  opportunities,  what  the \navailable advanced technologies are, currently available global opportunities, the \nlegal background of the international market, and import and export procedures. \nTherefore, BDSs are a main success factor in relation to SMEs that are willing to \ngo  global.  (Source:  SME  holder,  apparel  sector,  in  Monaragala  District, \n22/10/2019) \n\nIn addition to the above highlighted success factors, awareness related to international \ntrade procedures, the ability to produce innovations, better access to information related \nto global markets, institutional support, and networking with both local and international \npartners  are  also  recognized  as  \u201cvery  important\u201d  factors  by  more  than  30%  of \nrespondents on average.  \n\n5.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nThe current study focuses on the impact of GVCs on the performance of SMEs in Uva \nand  the  central  provinces  of  Sri  Lanka.  Moreover,  the  study  examines  potential  local \nbusiness  sectors  that  can  be  linked  with  GVCs  and  also  key  challenges  and  main \nsuccess factors in relation to linking SMEs with GVCs. A mixed research method that \ncombined  both  quantitative  and  qualitative  data  and  analytical  tools  was  employed  \nto  accomplish  the  research  objectives.  More  specifically,  329  SMEs  were  surveyed  \nto  collect  quantitative  data  while  four  and  eight  FGDs  and  KIIs  were  respectively \nconducted  to  gather  qualitative  information.  A  regression  equation  based  on  three \ndifferent  models  was  econometrically  estimated  to  quantify  the  impact  of  linking  with \nGVCs on the performance of SMEs while descriptive analysis was employed in relation \nto  other  objectives  of  the  study.  According  to  the  survey  findings,  over  60%  of  the  \n200 entrepreneurs  were  male.  It  is  felt  that  the patriarchal  values  still  prevail  in  these \nprovinces.  Nevertheless,  there  are  signs  of  change  with  several  initiatives  of  multiple \norganizations targeting the empowerment of women. The average age of SME holders \nis  between  40  and  50.  SME  holders  in  the  Nuwara  Eliya  district  have  the  lowest \neducational  qualifications  followed  by  the  Monaragala  district,  while  SME  holders  in  \nthe  Badulla  and  Matale  districts  have  the  highest  educational  attainments.  According  \nto  the  survey  findings,  over  80%  of  the  SMEs  in  each  district  are  at  a  micro  level.  \nThe  Badulla  district  accounts  for  the  largest  number  of  micro-level  SMEs  followed  \nby  the  Monaragala  district.  There  are  a  larger  number  of  industrial  sector  SMEs  than \nagriculture  and  service  sector  ones.  According  to  the  survey  findings,  about  80%  of \nmicro-level SMEs in the Matale district are industry related while 71.8% and 56.4% are \nin  the  Monaragala  and  Badulla  districts,  respectively.  The  study  recognized  10  main \ntypes of business, including agriculture, farming and dairy industry, food and beverages, \narts and craft, and apparel and bag production. \n\nThe econometric analysis found that SMEs that are linked with GVCs have a higher level \nof profit than SMEs that are not. Therefore, there is a positive relationship between linking \nwith  GVCs  and SMEs\u2019  performance  and this  relationship  is  consistent  even when  the \nmodels are controlled by other firm characteristics. Apart from the direct impact of GVCs \non  SMEs\u2019  performance,  the  study  also  observed  that  linking  with  GVCs  indirectly \nincreases the performance of SMEs through enhancing the sales revenue and research \nand development activities of SMEs. In addition to the key findings, the estimated models \n\n22 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1153 \n \n\nDeyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n\nalso confirm that factors such as capital assets, number of workers, sales revenue of \nfirms,  human  capital,  and  types  of  SMEs  also  affect  the  performance  of  SMEs.  The \ndescriptive  analysis  recognized  five  main  business  sectors,  namely  information \ntechnology,  apparel,  gems  and  minerals,  tea  and  other  agricultural  products,  and \nhandcraft, as the sectors with the most potential to link with GVCs. Moreover, among \nthese five business sectors, SMEs in business sectors such as information technology, \napparel, and gems and minerals have greater intention to link with GVCs. Furthermore, \nthe study recognized a total of 10 key challenges that SMEs face when they attempt to \nlink with GVCs. Challenges such as a lack of access to finance, a lack of technology, a \nlack of information, being unable to meet quality standards, and being unable to produce \nthe quantity required were recognized as the most critical challenges. In addition to key \nchallenges, the survey also identified 12 key success factors that stimulate the process \nof  linking  SMEs  with  GVCs.  As  the  survey  highlighted,  factors  such  as  ensuring  the \nquality of products, the availability of skilled labor, better access to finance, access to \nbetter technologies, the ability to produce at low cost, and access to BDSs increase the \npotential to link SMEs with GVCs. \n\nthrough \n\nindicate \n\nfindings  of \n\nforeign  direct \n\nthe  study  strongly \n\nThe \nthat  government,  nongovernment \norganizations,  and  policy  makers  should  encourage  SMEs  to  participate  in  GVCs  \nby  allowing  them  to  grow  as  internationally  competitive  entrepreneurs.  Firstly,  it  is \nessential to recognize new SMEs that are interested in linking with GVCs and also SMEs \nthat are already involved with GVCs. Then, it is recommended to ensure a solid public-\nprivate partnership in order to inculcate an entrepreneurial culture in the society and to \nprovide advanced technological know-how. Advanced technological know-how can be \nattracted \ntherefore  both  Uva  \nand the central provinces should facilitate to access to such FDIs efficiently. Moreover, \nlocal  and  international  training  for  SME  holders  can  also  be  an  option  to  enhance \ntechnological  know-how.  Moreover,  financial  facilities  and  also  access  to  financial \nfacilities should be improved by getting the help of both state-owned and private banks \nand  financial  institutions.  In  particular,  recognized  SME  sectors  such  as  information \ntechnology,  apparel,  gems  and  minerals,  tea  and  other  agricultural  products,  and \nhandcraft  should  be  prioritized  when  providing  financial  facilities.  Additionally,  SMEs \nshould be enriched with symmetric and efficient information and awareness regarding \nGVCs and production networks, required infrastructures, appropriate BDSs, and training \nprograms to develop human capital capabilities to enhance the SMEs\u2019 potential to link \nwith GVCs.  \n\ninvestments  (FDIs)  and \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n23 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1153 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nDeyshappriya and Maduwanthi \n\nAbe, M.
