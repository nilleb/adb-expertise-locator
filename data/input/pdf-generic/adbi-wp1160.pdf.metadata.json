INTRODUCTION \n\nBeirne, Renzhi, and Volz \n\nClimate risks can have material impact on the sustainability of public finances. In climate-\nvulnerable countries,  fiscal health  is  under  threat  by  potential output  losses  related  to \nclimate  hazards  and  disaster  recovery  costs,  as  well  as  transition  risks  that  may  hit \nspecific  sectors  or  the  economy  at  large.  For  example,  Koetsier  (2017)  finds  a \nconsiderable increase in government debt for most damaging and deadliest disasters. \nWhile a growing body of research has studied the macroeconomic impacts of climate \nchange  (Hochrainer  2009;  von  Peter,  von  Dahlen,  and  Saxena  2012;  Cabezon  et  al. \n2015;  Batten  2018;  Mercure  et  al.  2018;  Cantelmo,  Melina,  and  Papageorgiou  2019; \nBatten, Sowerbutts, and Tanaka 2020), relatively little research has been conducted on \nthe nexus between climate risk and sovereign risk. That said, recent research by Kling \net al. (2018) on the relationship between climate vulnerability, sovereign credit profiles, \nand  the  cost  of  capital  in  climate-vulnerable  developing  countries  shows  that  these \ncountries incur a risk premium on their sovereign debt, reducing their fiscal capacity for \ninvestments  in  climate  adaptation  and  resilience. 1  Although  this  is  an  area  that  is \nincreasingly  receiving  attention  from  rating  agencies,  to  date  there  has  been  little \nsystematic research to investigate this deeper.2 \n\nOur paper builds upon the work carried out by Kling et al. (2018), primarily through the \nuse of a series of structural panel VARs that allow us to examine the response of bond \nyields  to  shocks  imposed  on  climate  risk  and  resilience.  The  regression  analysis \nconducted in the first stage of our approach is largely consistent with the findings of Kling \net al. (2018) in terms of the extent of the effect of climate risk on bond yields, although \nour  paper  employs  alternative  measures  of  climate  risk  and  a  higher  data  frequency. \nHowever, the main added value of our approach is the examination of how bond yields \nreact to climate risk and resilience shocks which, crucially, control a large set of domestic \nand global factors. \n\nOur findings confirm that climate vulnerability has significant implications for sovereign \nborrowing costs, and that the direct effects of climate change matter substantially more \nthan climate risk resilience. Furthermore, the magnitude of the effect on bond yields is \nlarger  for  countries  deemed  highly  vulnerable  to  climate  change.  Impulse  response \nanalysis  suggests  that  the  reaction  of  bond  yields  to  shocks  imposed  on  climate \nvulnerability and resilience become permanent after around 12 quarters, and that high \nrisk economies experience larger permanent effects on yields than other country groups. \nThe  remainder  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  The  next  section  provides  an \noverview of the related literature. Section 3 lays out our empirical methodology and the \ndata that we use. Section 4 presents the empirical results. Section 5 concludes. \n\n2.  RELATED LITERATURE \n\nThis paper contributes to the literature on the determinants of the price of sovereign risk, \nwith  early  work  by  Edwards  (1984)  finding  a  strong  role  for  domestic  macroeconomic \nfundamentals  to  play  in  driving  government  bond  spreads,  particularly  public  debt, \nforeign  reserves,  the  current  account  balance,  and  inflation.  More  recently,  work  on \nsovereign risk has been set against the context of the European sovereign debt crisis. \nBeirne and Fratzscher (2013) find in a study of 31 advanced and emerging economies \n\n \n\n1   See also Buhr et al. (2018). \n2   Credit ratings agencies are increasingly incorporating climate risk into their assessment of sovereign risk \n\nand risk across other asset classes (e.g., Mathiesen 2018).  \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1160 \n \n\nBeirne, Renzhi, and Volz \n\nfundamentals  are \n\nthe  main  driver  of \n\nthat  worsening  economic \nthe  price  \nof  sovereign  risk.  However,  in  crisis  times,  a  further  important  issue  was  found  to  \nbe \u2018fundamentals contagion\u2019\u2014i.e., an abrupt increase in financial market sensitivity to \nfundamentals.  Other  work  by  Aizenman,  Hutchison,  and  Jinjarak  (2013),  studying  \n60  economies,  find  evidence  that  credit  default  swap  (CDS)  spreads  for  euro  area \nperiphery countries were mispriced based on a set of macroeconomic fundamentals (see \nalso  Amato  2005;  Packer  and  Zhu  2005;  Cecchetti,  Mohanty,  and  Zampolli  2010). \nD\u2019Agostino  and Ehrmann  (2014)  focus  on  the  G7  economies,  showing  that  sovereign \nrisk appears to have been mispriced both before and after the crisis. Favero and Missale \n(2012) make the point that when global risk aversion is high, this can increase the role \nplayed  by  fiscal  fundamentals  in  driving  the  price  of  sovereign  risk.  The  issue  of \ncontagion has also been a feature of the literature on government bond yields. Some of \nthis work has focused on spillovers and contagion between sovereigns and banks. For \nexample, Alter and Beyer (2014) test the effect on sovereign risk and bank CDS from \nunexpected  shocks  imposed  on  sovereign  creditworthiness  and  country-specific  bank \nindices.  Other  work  has  taken  a  financial  integration  perspective,  with  Baldacci  and \nKumar  (2010)  noting  that  price  discovery  in  government  bond  markets  and  the  more \nefficient  pricing  of  sovereign  risk  are  associated  with  the  ongoing  integration  of \ngovernment bond markets at the global level.  \n\ninclude \n\nThere  is  a  range  of  channels  through  which  the  cost  of  sovereign  borrowing  may  be \naffected by climate  change,  and  these  are  important  to  consider  in  the context  of  the \ncurrent paper. One way that this may occur is through the depletion of natural capital, \nand  implications  for  fiscal  sustainability  and  the  price  of  sovereign  risk  (e.g.,  Pinz\u00f3n  \net al. 2020). Climate risk can also affect sovereign risk due to the fiscal impact of climate-\nrelated natural disasters. For example, macroeconomic risks related to natural disasters \nand  extreme  weather \nrisks  of  a  disruption  of  economic  activity,  \nwhich may adversely affect tax income and other public revenues and increase social \ntransfer  payments  (e.g.,  Schuler  et  al.  2019).  A  further  channel  relates  to  the  fiscal \nconsequences of adaptation and mitigation policies for climate change. Public adaptation \nto climate change affects public budgets directly on the expenditure side (e.g., Bachner, \nBednar-Friedl, and Knittel 2019). Likewise, investment in mitigation\u2014for example, clean \nenergy investment\u2014can strain public finances, while climate mitigation policies such as \ncarbon  taxes  can  affect  the  revenue  side.  United  Nations  Conference  on  Trade  and \nDevelopment  (2019)  estimations  for  a  group  of  31  developing  countries  suggest  that \npublic  debt-to-GDP  ratios  would  have  to  rise  from  47%  to  185%  to  finance  basic \ninvestments  to  meet  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  in  poverty,  nutrition,  health, \nand  education  if  these  investments  had  to  be  financed  through  debt.  Many  of  these \ninvestments  are  linked  to  adaptation  and  mitigation.  Less  developed  economies \nespecially tend to have a relatively low debt servicing capacity and are vulnerable to the \nbuild-up  of  external  debt.  Since  these  are  the  countries  with  the  greatest  need  for \nadaptation finance, it will be important to develop robust debt management frameworks \nand limit risk exposure to international debt financing.  \n\nClimate  change  can  also  affect  the  cost  of  sovereign  borrowing  via  broader \nmacroeconomic implications. The first progress report of the Network of Central Banks \nand Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) stresses that climate risks \ncan  have  negative  side  effects  on  macroeconomic  conditions,  leading  to  lower \ninvestment,  financial  losses,  and  disruption  in  asset  valuations  (NGFS  2018).  On  the \nmacroeconomic  impacts  of  climate  change,  our  paper  contributes  to  the  strand  of \nliterature that examines the implications of climate change for long-run economic growth. \nSupply and demand shocks from extreme weather events, although short-term in nature, \ncan have lasting impacts on growth (Acevedo 2014; Klomp and Valckx 2014; Botzen, \nDeschenes, and Sanders 2019) and public finances. Moreover, the supply and demand \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1160 \n \n\nBeirne, Renzhi, and Volz \n\nside  effects  of  gradual  global  warming  and  transition  impacts  can  cause  fundamental \nand enduring structural changes to the economy, and adversely affect long-term output \ntrajectories (Burke, Hsiang, and Miguel 2015a; Kahn et al. 2019). For many countries, \nclimate  change  will  have  a profound  impact  on  their  long-run  productive  capacity  and \npotential output. A country\u2019s long-term growth potential will inevitably have ramifications \nfor public finances and debt sustainability. In addition, the extent to which climate change \naffects financial stability can have ramifications for the cost of sovereign borrowing and \nthe  price  of  sovereign  risk.  For  example,  physical  risks  related  to  extreme  weather \nconditions can cause a rise in bank credit risk owing to damage to the operating assets \nand production output of borrowers. This may lead to an inability of borrowers to meet \ntheir  debt  service  obligations,  and  a  higher  incidence  of  non-performing  loans,  with \nnegative implications for the sovereign risk profile. Bolton et al. (2020) note that central \nbanks \nas  \na \u2018climate rescuer of last resort\u2019 in a systemic financial crisis by purchasing significant \namounts of impaired financial sector assets. Empirical research on bailouts indicates that \nthere can be negative implications for public debt ratios (e.g., Acharya, Drechsler, and \nSchnabl  2014;  European  Central  Bank  2015).  Also,  it  is  important  to  consider  \nhow  natural  disasters  may  impact  upon  international  capital  flows  (e.g.,  David  2010; \nEscaleras  and  Register  2011;  Osberghaus  2019),  affecting  balance  of  payments \npositions and thus sovereign risk. Finally, climate risk could lead to a rise in sovereign \ndefault  rates  should  it  lead  to  political  instability.  The  positive  link  between  political \ninstability and sovereign default has been widely researched (e.g., Clark 1997; Cuadra \nand  Sapriza  2008).  However,  more  recently,  there  has  been  some  work  to  show  \nthat  climate-related  disasters  can  lead  to  migration  within  and  between  countries,  \nwhich  may  induce  political  instability  (e.g.,  Black  et  al.  2011;  Burke,  Hsiang,  and  \nMiguel 2015b). \n\nseriously \n\nconsider \n\npossible \n\nneed \n\nrole \n\nto \n\na \n\nWhile it is not the aim of our paper to test all of these transmission channels between \nclimate risk and sovereign risk, we seek to empirically confirm the nexus between climate \nvulnerability and higher sovereign cost of debt identified by Kling et al. (2018). The latter \nstudy conducts a panel and principal component analysis with annual data for a sample \nof 46 countries over the period 1996\u20132016, and finds that countries with higher exposure \nto  climate  vulnerability,  measured  by  indices  from  the  Notre  Dame  Global  Adaptation \nInitiative  (ND-GAIN),  exhibit  higher  cost  of  debt. 3  The  present  paper  builds  on  this \nanalysis, using higher frequency data and refined measures of climate vulnerability, risk, \nand  resilience.  Importantly,  we  also  develop  a  set  of  structural  panel  VAR  models  to \nconduct an impulse response analysis and simulate shocks on climate vulnerability and \nresilience. \n\n3.  DATA AND EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY \n\nA twofold approach is implemented. First, using quarterly data frequency, we use a fixed \neffects panel model over the period from 2002Q1 to 2018Q4 across 40 countries, the \nsample of which includes advanced economies, emerging economies (EMEs), and the \nmember  countries  of  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN). 4  \nWe also examine a sub-panel based on economies characterized as having high climate-\nrelated  risks,  defined  as  being  in  the  top  quartile  for  risk  exposure.  The  first  stage \nexamines the drivers of sovereign bond yields, based on a large set of macroeconomic \n\n \n\n3   In a related paper using firm-level data, Kling et al. (2020) show that climate vulnerability also affects the \ncost of corporate financing and access to finance, controlling for various firm-specific and macroeconomic \nfactors. \n\n4   See Table A1 in the Appendix for the full list of countries. \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1160 \n \n\nBeirne, Renzhi, and Volz \n\ntwo \n\nand \n\nclimate-related \n\ndata \nvulnerability  \nand  climate  risk  resilience).  Drawing  on  the  literature  that  examines  the  drivers  of \nsovereign  bond  yields  and  the  price  of  sovereign  risk,  the  macroeconomic  controls \ninclude  the  current  account  balance,  public  debt/GDP,  the  fiscal  balance,  GDP  per \ncapita, and GDP growth. These variables have been attained from Bloomberg, the IMF \nInternational Financial Statistics, the OECD, and China Economic Database (CEIC).5 \n\nindicators \n\n(climate \n\nrisk \n\nRegarding  the  climate  vulnerability  indicator,  data  for  vulnerability  to  climate  risk  are \ntaken from a refined version of the ND-GAIN vulnerability index developed by Kling et al. \n(2020). The refined vulnerability measure comprises all of the components from the ND-\nGAIN  vulnerability  index  that  are  not  highly  related  to  economic  variables  in  order  to \nmitigate  against  endogeneity  concerns. 6  Data  for  climate  resilience  are  from  FTSE \nRussell. This indicator refers to the extent to which an economy has measures in place \nto address exposure to climate risks. Details of the construction of these variables are \nshown in the Appendix (Tables A3 and A4).7  \n\nThe following baseline equation is estimated: \n\nyi,t = \u03b2xi,t-1 + \u03b3Zi,t-1 + \u03c7VIXt-1 + \u03c4USYt-1 + CRISISi,t-1 + \u03b4i + \u03b5i,t i=1,\u2026,N, t=1,\u2026,T  (1) \n\nwhere  yi,t  represents  the  government  bond  yield;  xi,t  represents  a  set  of  domestic \nmacroeconomic  fundamentals;  Zj  denotes  our  climate  vulnerability  and  resilience \nindicators; VIX stands for the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index, \na  measure  of  global  risk  aversion;  USY  are  US  long-term  government  bond  yields; \nCRISIS represents the Laeven and Valencia (2018) indicator for the incidence of a crisis \nevent for each country in the sample; \u03b4i are country fixed effects; and \u03b5i,t is the error term. \nThe variables are lagged by one period to mitigate against endogeneity concerns. \n\nSecond,  a  structural  panel  VAR  is  used  to  examine  the  response  of  sovereign  bond \nyields to shocks to climate vulnerability and resilience. Crucially, these shocks control for \na  range  of  macroeconomic  fundamentals  and  global  factors.  The  panel  SVAR  is \nimplemented across the same 40 countries as in stage one, but over the period from \n2007Q1 to 2017Q4 in a balanced set-up. The panel SVAR can be denoted as follows in \nits general specification, with structural shocks identified by a recursive restriction: \n\n   \n\n (2) \n\n\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f)\u0394\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\n\nwhere  A(L)  is  the  matrix  of  lag  polynomial;  Yi,t  refers  to  the  demeaned  value  of  Xt  of \ncountry i to accommodate country-specific fixed effects; and \u03b5i,t is a vector of structural \ndisturbances.  Following  the  setting  of  the  previous  SVAR  model,  we  take  a  first-\ndifferencing form of Yi,t as \u0394Yi,t. The ordering of the variables imposed in the recursive \n\n \n\n5   See Table A2 in the Appendix for details of all variables used, including sources. \n6   The original ND-GAIN vulnerability index (Chen et al. 2015) comprises three core measures: (i) the extent \nto  which  an  economy  is  exposed  to  significant  climate  change  from  a  biophysical  perspective;  \n(ii) the degree to which an economy is dependent upon sectors that are particularly sensitive to climate \nchange;  and  (iii)  the  extent  of  an  economy\u2019s  adaptive  capacity  to  climate  change.  This  measure  can \ntherefore be interpreted as an overall measure reflecting both physical and transition climate-related risks. \nWe use the refined measure by Kling et al. (2020) which strips out measures that are highly correlated \nwith  macroeconomic  variables,  so  that  the  new  vulnerability  index  is  less  correlated  with  countries\u2019 \nfinancial or economic conditions, which might cause endogeneity. \n\n7   As can be seen from Tables A3 and A4 in the Appendix, there is largely no overlap in the components of \nthe climate vulnerability and resilience indicators. The only overlap applies to just one component, namely \nthe freshwater withdrawal rate.  \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1160 \n \n\nBeirne, Renzhi, and Volz \n\nform is the same as the previous SVAR model. The panel VAR includes two lags selected \nby the Akaike information criterion (AIC). \n\nOur  identification  strategy  is  based  on  a  block  recursive  restriction  (Christiano, \nEichenbaum,  and  Evans  1999),  which  results  in  the  following  matrix \n to  fit  a  just-\nidentified model: \n\n\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\n\n(3) \n\n\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34 =\n\n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e1,1\n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e2,1\n\u22ee\n\n \n\u2026\n\u23a4\n\u23a1\n\u22f1\n\u23a5\n\u23a2\n\u22f1\n\u23a5\n\u23a2\n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e11,1 \u2026 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e11,10 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e11,11\u23a6\n\u23a3\n\n0\n\u22f1\n\u22f1\n\n0\n\u22ee\n0\n\n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e2,1, \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e11,1, . .. \n\nThe ordering of the variables imposed in the recursive form implies that the variables  \n)  will  not  be  affected  by  contemporaneous  shocks  to  the  \nat  the  top  (such  as \nlower  variables  (such  as \n),  while  the  lower  variables  will  be  affected  by \n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e1,1\ncontemporaneous shocks to the upper variables. Usually, slower moving variables are \nbetter  candidates  to  be  ordered  before  fast-moving  variables  (Bruno  and  Shin  2015).  \nIt  follows  therefore  that  we  place  the  climate  vulnerability  variable  at  the  top  in  the \nordering, which implies that it will only be affected by contemporaneous shock to itself. \nFollowing the vulnerability variable, we place the climate resilience variable second in \nthe ordering, which implies that resilience will be affected by contemporaneous shocks \nto  vulnerability  and  itself,  but  not  by  contemporaneous  shocks  to  macroeconomic \nfundamentals  or  sovereign  bond  yields.  Importantly,  we  put  the  sovereign  yields  in  \nlast place in the ordering, which is not only based on the assumption that climate risk will \naffect bond yields, but also on the consideration of our first-stage empirical results that \nimply the macroeconomic fundamentals that are driving bond yields. Last, we place our \nmacroeconomic  fundamentals  in  the  middle  of  the  ordering.

The  results  are  presented \nacross four main country groups: advanced economies, emerging markets, ASEAN, and \na  high  risk  group. 9  Across  all  countries  as  a  whole,  controlling  for  domestic  and  \nglobal  factors,  it  is  clear  that  vulnerability  to  climate  risk  and  resilience  to  climate risk \nhave significant effects on sovereign bond yields. Increases in vulnerability and lower \nresilience to climate risks lead to rises in bond yields.10 The premium on sovereign bond \nyields from rising climate risk vulnerability is highest for the high risk group at 275 basis \npoints, compared to 155 basis points for ASEAN and 113 basis points for other EMEs. \n\n \n\n8   As shown in Figure A5 in the Appendix, the models estimated across all the country groups appear to \nexplain sovereign bond yields well based on a comparison of actual yields and the yields implied by the \nmodels\u2014i.e., the fitted values. \n\n9   The high risk group is defined as economies that are in the top quartile for climate risk exposure based \non  the  refined  ND-GAIN  vulnerability  index  (Kling  et  al.  2020).  This  group  comprises  the  following \ncountries:  Japan,  the  Netherlands,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Sri  Lanka,  Singapore,  the  Philippines,  \nViet Nam, Thailand, Indonesia, and India. \n\n10  The direction of the effects is in line with intuition and also reflects the pattern that can be observed from \nraw  plots  of  sovereign  bond  yields  against  our  climate  risk  indicators  (see  Figures  A1  to  A4  in  the \nAppendix). \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1160 \n \n\nBeirne, Renzhi, and Volz \n\nThe  effect  of  vulnerability  on  bond  yields  for  advanced  economies  is  not  statistically \nsignificant.

First, it is apparent that vulnerability to climate \nrisk  matters  substantially  more  for  the  cost  of  sovereign  borrowing  than  resilience  to \nclimate risk. In other words, exposure to the direct effects of climate change remains key, \nwith a sizable and significant impact on the cost of sovereign debt for developing and \nemerging economies. Improving resilience efforts further may help to combat exposure \nto these direct effects and hence bring down the cost of sovereign financing. Second, it \n\n11  Interpretation of the coefficients on vulnerability and resilience applies to a unitary rise in the series\u2019 which \n\nare standardized between 0 and 1. \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1160 \n \n\nBeirne, Renzhi, and Volz \n\nto \n\nrisks. \n\nclimate \n\nexposed \n\nare  more \n\nis clear that the magnitude of the effect on bond yields is notably higher for economies \nthat \neffect  \non bond yields for the high risk group is higher than for EMEs as a whole by a factor  \nof  about  three,  and  higher  than  for  ASEAN  by  a  factor  of  around  two.  Our  findings \ntherefore suggest that those economies that are particularly exposed to climate change \nand  have  the  greatest  need  for  resilience  investment  face  the  highest  climate  risk \npremium  on  their  sovereign  borrowing  costs.  Given  that  a  significant  share  of  the \nfinancing  of  adaptation  and  vulnerability  reduction  measures  would  have  to  be  borne  \nby  the  public  sector,  a  higher  cost  of  borrowing  could  severely  hamper  these  crucial \ninvestments.12 \n\nparticular, \n\nthe \n\nIn \n\nTurning  to  the  domestic  macroeconomic  fundamentals,  worsening  current  account \npositions, lower GDP per capita, and lower GDP growth have detrimental effects on the \ncost of sovereign borrowing, increasing yields as expected. Economies with weak net \ninternational  investment  positions  tend  to  have  higher  bond  yields.  Moreover,  lower \nlevels of economic development and growth prospects can lead to investor flight, thereby \nincreasing sovereign bond yields. Other important factors affecting bond yields include \nthe public debt/GDP ratio and the fiscal balance. On global factors, positive spillovers \nfrom  the  US bond  market  are  evident  in the  majority of  cases  as  expected,  similar  to \nglobal risk aversion. \n\nAs  a  robustness  check,  we  also  examine  alternative  measures  of  climate  risk \nvulnerability.  These  results  are  provided  in  Table  A5  in  the  Appendix  and  are  fully \nconsistent with those from our baseline specification. Using measures of physical climate \nrisks and transition risks taken from FTSE Russell (Table A6 in the Appendix), we find \nthat both transition and physical risk are positively and significantly related to sovereign \nbond yields. On transition risks\u2014i.e., risks related to shifting to a low-carbon economy\u2014\nwe find that the magnitudes of the effects on sovereign bond yields are lower on average \nacross our sample of countries than for physical risks or resilience. This may be related \nto the fact that financial markets have not yet fully priced in these risks. Nonetheless, the \neffect that we find is certainly not trivial, in particular for higher risk-exposed groups. On \nphysical risks, we find that the effect on sovereign bond yields is significant in all cases \napart from advanced economies. Exposure to the physical effects of climate risk is clearly \na factor that policymakers should be increasingly aware of. As in our baseline, and as \nexpected, we find that the magnitude of the effect on yields from physical climate risks \nis  large  for  economies  deemed  to  be  exposed  due  to  their  geographic  location  and \npropensity  for  the  incidence  of  natural  climate-related  disasters.  These  include  the \nASEAN \nas  \nin \nsub-panels  deemed  high  risk  (the  top  quartile  of  countries  based  on  physical  and \ntransition risk exposure) and very high risk (the top decile of countries based on physical \nand transition risk exposure). Indeed, we find that the magnitude of the effect on yields \nis  progressively  higher  as  the  degree  of  risk  exposure  rises,  in  line  with  economic \nintuition. \n\ncountries \n\nsample, \n\ngroup \n\nwell \n\nour \n\nas \n\nof \n\nIn order to understand better the relationship between sovereign bond yields and climate \nrisk exposure and resilience, we delve into this issue further using a structural panel VAR \napproach. Across our full sample, as well as sub-panels, Figure 1 shows the effect on \nsovereign  bond  yields  following  a  one  standard  deviation  shock  on  climate  risk \nvulnerability and resilience. \n\n \n\n12  Some  have  argued  that  adaptation  measures  should  be  conducted  by  the  private  sector  and  that  \nthe role of the government is limited to setting the right incentives (e.g., Tol 2005; Jones, Keen, and Strand \n2013). \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1160 \n \n\nBeirne, Renzhi, and Volz \n\nFigure 1: Response of Sovereign Bond Yields to Climate Risk Vulnerability  \nand Climate Risk Resilience Shocks \n\nAll countries \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAdvanced economies \n\nEmerging economies \n\nASEAN \n\nHigh risk economies \n\n8 \n \n\nNote: Pink line represents 95% confidence interval. Blue line represents the impulse response of government bond yield \nto shocks. \n\nSource: Authors. \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1160 \n \n\nBeirne, Renzhi, and Volz \n\nFigure 1 indicates that across the sample of 40 countries, sovereign bond yields respond \npositively to a positive shock imposed on climate risk vulnerability, and negatively to a \npositive  shock  on  resilience,  in  line  with  economic  intuition.  The  shock  becomes \npermanent after around 12 quarters. The direction of the effect of the shocks on bond \nyields is consistent across each of our sub-panels. Moreover, and in line with our stage \none analysis, the magnitude of the effect on bond yields is notably larger for economies \nin the high risk category.  \n\nFor the high risk economies, the upward effect on yields of the vulnerability shock peaks \nat around six quarters, while for ASEAN and other EMEs, the peak is reached at a longer \nduration of around 15\u201318 quarters, albeit with lower magnitudes. The upward reaction of \nadvanced  economy  bond  yields  also  peaks  after  around  six  quarters.  For  shocks  to \nclimate risk resilience, the downward response of yields is most pronounced after around \nsix quarters for EMEs, ASEAN, and the high risk group, with advanced economy bond \nyields peaking downwards much more quickly after around two quarters. Given that the \neffect of climate risk vulnerability and resilience to climate risk on sovereign bond yields \nis  not  transitory  and  does  not  subside  over  time,  this  underscores  the  importance  for \npolicymakers to ramp up efforts aimed at mitigating the effects of physical climate risks. \nWithout such action, the negative ramifications for fiscal sustainability and, as a result, \neconomic growth could be substantial. \n\n5.  CONCLUSIONS \n\nThis paper contributes to a better understanding of the effects of climate vulnerability on \nthe price of sovereign risk and fiscal sustainability. Set against the a growing literature \nhighlighting the impacts of climate risks on macroeconomic conditions, this paper tests \nempirically  the  link  between  climate  vulnerability  and  resilience  to  climate  risk  and \nsovereign bond yields. This is also an important issue to consider in light of the increasing \nincorporation  of  climate  risk  by  credit  risk  agencies  in  their  sovereign  rating \nmethodologies. Using a diverse sample of 40 advanced and emerging economies, many \nof which are particularly vulnerable to climate risks due to their geographical location and \nsusceptibility  to  natural  disasters,  our  results  provide  evidence  that  climate  risks  and \nresilience to these risks have significant effects on the cost of sovereign borrowing. In \nparticular,  higher  climate  risk  vulnerability  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  lower  climate  risk \nresilience, lead to significant rises in the cost of sovereign borrowing. Given the material \neffects of climate change on the cost of sovereign borrowing, our analysis indicates that \nmore attention needs to be paid to the incorporation of climate risk into the operational \nframeworks  of  central  banks.  Moreover,  the  issue  warrants  further  consideration  by \nfinancial supervisors from a financial stability perspective. Last but not least, our findings \nstrongly suggest  that  adaptation  investments  that  help  to  mitigate  climate  risks  would \ncontribute  to  a  lowering  of  the  cost  of  sovereign  debt,  and  this  would  provide  much-\nneeded fiscal space to those countries particularly affected by climate change. \n\n \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1160 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nBeirne, Renzhi, and Volz \n\nAcevedo, S. 2014. \u201cDebt, Growth and Natural Disasters: A Caribbean Trilogy.\u201d IMF \nWorking Paper No. 14/125.

Controlling  for  a  large set  of  domestic  and \nglobal  factors,  the  paper  shows  that  both  vulnerability  and  resilience  to  climate  risk  are \nimportant factors driving the cost of sovereign borrowing at the global level. Overall, we find \nthat vulnerability to the direct effects of climate change matter substantially more than climate \nrisk  resilience  in  terms  of  the  implications  for  sovereign  borrowing  costs.  Moreover,  the \nmagnitude of  the  effect  on bond yields  is  progressively  higher  for  countries deemed  highly \nvulnerable to climate change. Impulse response analysis from a set of panel structural VAR \nmodels indicates that the reaction of bond yields to shocks imposed on climate vulnerability \nand  resilience  become  permanent  after  around  12  quarters,  with  high  risk  economies \nexperiencing larger permanent effects on yields than other country groups. \n \nKeywords: climate risk, cost of sovereign borrowing  \n \nJEL Classification: F32, F41, F62 \n \n", " \n"]}
