INTRODUCTION \nClimate risks can have material impact on the sustainability of public finances. In climate-\nvulnerable countries, fiscal health is under threat by potential output losses related to \nclimate hazards and disaster recovery costs, as well as transition risks that may hit \nspecific  sectors  or  the  economy  at  large.  For  example,  Koetsier  (2017)  finds  a \nconsiderable increase in government debt for most damaging and deadliest disasters. \nWhile a growing body of research has studied the macroeconomic impacts of climate \nchange (Hochrainer 2009; von Peter, von Dahlen, and Saxena 2012; Cabezon et al. \n2015; Batten 2018; Mercure et al. 2018; Cantelmo, Melina, and Papageorgiou 2019; \nBatten, Sowerbutts, and Tanaka 2020), relatively little research has been conducted on \nthe nexus between climate risk and sovereign risk. That said, recent research by Kling \net al. (2018) on the relationship between climate vulnerability, sovereign credit profiles, \nand the cost of capital in climate-vulnerable developing countries shows that these \ncountries incur a risk premium on their sovereign debt, reducing their fiscal capacity for \ninvestments in climate adaptation and resilience.1 Although this is an area that is \nincreasingly receiving attention from rating agencies, to date there has been little \nsystematic research to investigate this deeper.2 \nOur paper builds upon the work carried out by Kling et al. (2018), primarily through the \nuse of a series of structural panel VARs that allow us to examine the response of bond \nyields  to  shocks  imposed  on  climate  risk  and  resilience.  The  regression  analysis \nconducted in the first stage of our approach is largely consistent with the findings of Kling \net al. (2018) in terms of the extent of the effect of climate risk on bond yields, although \nour paper employs alternative measures of climate risk and a higher data frequency. \nHowever, the main added value of our approach is the examination of how bond yields \nreact to climate risk and resilience shocks which, crucially, control a large set of domestic \nand global factors. \nOur findings confirm that climate vulnerability has significant implications for sovereign \nborrowing costs, and that the direct effects of climate change matter substantially more \nthan climate risk resilience. Furthermore, the magnitude of the effect on bond yields is \nlarger for countries deemed highly vulnerable to climate change. Impulse response \nanalysis suggests  that  the  reaction of  bond  yields  to  shocks  imposed  on  climate \nvulnerability and resilience become permanent after around 12 quarters, and that high \nrisk economies experience larger permanent effects on yields than other country groups. \nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section provides an \noverview of the related literature. Section 3 lays out our empirical methodology and the \ndata that we use. Section 4 presents the empirical results. Section 5 concludes. \n2.  RELATED LITERATURE \nThis paper contributes to the literature on the determinants of the price of sovereign risk, \nwith early work by Edwards (1984) finding a strong role for domestic macroeconomic \nfundamentals to play in driving government bond spreads, particularly public debt, \nforeign reserves, the current account balance, and inflation. More recently, work on \nsovereign risk has been set against the context of the European sovereign debt crisis. \nBeirne and Fratzscher (2013) find in a study of 31 advanced and emerging economies \n \n1  See also Buhr et al. (2018). \n2  Credit ratings agencies are increasingly incorporating climate risk into their assessment of sovereign risk \nand risk across other asset classes (e.g., Mathiesen 2018).  \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1160  Beirne, Renzhi, and Volz \n \nthat  worsening  economic  fundamentals  are  the  main  driver  of  the  price  \nof sovereign risk. However, in crisis times, a further important issue was found to  \nbe \u2018fundamentals contagion\u2019\u2014i.e., an abrupt increase in financial market sensitivity to \nfundamentals.  Other  work  by  Aizenman,  Hutchison,  and  Jinjarak  (2013),  studying  \n60 economies, find evidence that credit default swap (CDS) spreads for euro area \nperiphery countries were mispriced based on a set of macroeconomic fundamentals (see \nalso Amato 2005; Packer and Zhu 2005; Cecchetti, Mohanty, and Zampolli 2010). \nD\u2019Agostino and Ehrmann (2014) focus on the G7 economies, showing that sovereign \nrisk appears to have been mispriced both before and after the crisis. Favero and Missale \n(2012) make the point that when global risk aversion is high, this can increase the role \nplayed by fiscal fundamentals in driving the price of sovereign risk. The issue of \ncontagion has also been a feature of the literature on government bond yields. Some of \nthis work has focused on spillovers and contagion between sovereigns and banks. For \nexample, Alter and Beyer (2014) test the effect on sovereign risk and bank CDS from \nunexpected shocks imposed on sovereign creditworthiness and country-specific bank \nindices. Other work has taken a financial integration perspective, with Baldacci and \nKumar (2010) noting that price discovery in government bond markets and the more \nefficient  pricing  of  sovereign  risk  are  associated  with  the  ongoing  integration  of \ngovernment bond markets at the global level.  \nThere is a range of channels through which the cost of sovereign borrowing may be \naffected by climate change, and these are important to consider in the context of the \ncurrent paper. One way that this may occur is through the depletion of natural capital, \nand implications for fiscal sustainability and the price of sovereign risk (e.g., Pinz\u00f3n  \net al. 2020). Climate risk can also affect sovereign risk due to the fiscal impact of climate-\nrelated natural disasters. For example, macroeconomic risks related to natural disasters \nand  extreme  weather  include  risks  of  a  disruption  of  economic  activity,  \nwhich may adversely affect tax income and other public revenues and increase social \ntransfer payments (e.g., Schuler et al. 2019). A further channel relates to the fiscal \nconsequences of adaptation and mitigation policies for climate change. Public adaptation \nto climate change affects public budgets directly on the expenditure side (e.g., Bachner, \nBednar-Friedl, and Knittel 2019). Likewise, investment in mitigation\u2014for example, clean \nenergy investment\u2014can strain public finances, while climate mitigation policies such as \ncarbon taxes can affect the revenue side. United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment (2019) estimations for a group of 31 developing countries suggest that \npublic debt-to-GDP ratios would have to rise from 47% to 185% to finance basic \ninvestments to meet the Sustainable Development Goals in poverty, nutrition, health, \nand education if these investments had to be financed through debt. Many of these \ninvestments  are  linked  to  adaptation  and  mitigation.  Less  developed  economies \nespecially tend to have a relatively low debt servicing capacity and are vulnerable to the \nbuild-up of external debt. Since these are the countries with the greatest need for \nadaptation finance, it will be important to develop robust debt management frameworks \nand limit risk exposure to international debt financing.  \nClimate  change  can  also  affect  the  cost  of  sovereign  borrowing  via  broader \nmacroeconomic implications. The first progress report of the Network of Central Banks \nand Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) stresses that climate risks \ncan  have  negative  side  effects  on  macroeconomic  conditions,  leading  to  lower \ninvestment, financial losses, and disruption in asset valuations (NGFS 2018). On the \nmacroeconomic impacts of climate change, our paper contributes to the strand of \nliterature that examines the implications of climate change for long-run economic growth. \nSupply and demand shocks from extreme weather events, although short-term in nature, \ncan have lasting impacts on growth (Acevedo 2014; Klomp and Valckx 2014; Botzen, \nDeschenes, and Sanders 2019) and public finances. Moreover, the supply and demand \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1160  Beirne, Renzhi, and Volz \n \nside effects of gradual global warming and transition impacts can cause fundamental \nand enduring structural changes to the economy, and adversely affect long-term output \ntrajectories (Burke, Hsiang, and Miguel 2015a; Kahn et al. 2019). For many countries, \nclimate change will have a profound impact on their long-run productive capacity and \npotential output. A country\u2019s long-term growth potential will inevitably have ramifications \nfor public finances and debt sustainability. In addition, the extent to which climate change \naffects financial stability can have ramifications for the cost of sovereign borrowing and \nthe price of sovereign risk. For example, physical risks related to extreme weather \nconditions can cause a rise in bank credit risk owing to damage to the operating assets \nand production output of borrowers. This may lead to an inability of borrowers to meet \ntheir debt service obligations, and a higher incidence of non-performing loans, with \nnegative implications for the sovereign risk profile. Bolton et al. (2020) note that central \nbanks  need  to  seriously  consider  a  possible  role  as  \na \u2018climate rescuer of last resort\u2019 in a systemic financial crisis by purchasing significant \namounts of impaired financial sector assets. Empirical research on bailouts indicates that \nthere can be negative implications for public debt ratios (e.g., Acharya, Drechsler, and \nSchnabl  2014;  European  Central  Bank  2015).  Also,  it  is  important  to  consider  \nhow natural disasters may impact upon international capital flows (e.g., David 2010; \nEscaleras  and  Register  2011;  Osberghaus  2019),  affecting  balance  of  payments \npositions and thus sovereign risk. Finally, climate risk could lead to a rise in sovereign \ndefault rates should it lead to political instability. The positive link between political \ninstability and sovereign default has been widely researched (e.g., Clark 1997; Cuadra \nand Sapriza 2008). However, more recently, there has been some work to show  \nthat  climate-related disasters can  lead  to  migration  within and between countries,  \nwhich may  induce political  instability  (e.g.,  Black et  al.  2011;  Burke,  Hsiang, and  \nMiguel 2015b). \nWhile it is not the aim of our paper to test all of these transmission channels between \nclimate risk and sovereign risk, we seek to empirically confirm the nexus between climate \nvulnerability and higher sovereign cost of debt identified by Kling et al. (2018). The latter \nstudy conducts a panel and principal component analysis with annual data for a sample \nof 46 countries over the period 1996\u20132016, and finds that countries with higher exposure \nto climate vulnerability, measured by indices from the Notre Dame Global Adaptation \nInitiative (ND-GAIN), exhibit higher cost of debt.3 The present paper builds on this \nanalysis, using higher frequency data and refined measures of climate vulnerability, risk, \nand resilience. Importantly, we also develop a set of structural panel VAR models to \nconduct an impulse response analysis and simulate shocks on climate vulnerability and \nresilience. \n3.  DATA AND EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY \nA twofold approach is implemented. First, using quarterly data frequency, we use a fixed \neffects panel model over the period from 2002Q1 to 2018Q4 across 40 countries, the \nsample of which includes advanced economies, emerging economies (EMEs), and the \nmember  countries  of  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN). 4  \nWe also examine a sub-panel based on economies characterized as having high climate-\nrelated risks, defined as being in the top quartile for risk exposure. The first stage \nexamines the drivers of sovereign bond yields, based on a large set of macroeconomic \n \n3  In a related paper using firm-level data, Kling et al. (2020) show that climate vulnerability also affects the \ncost of corporate financing and access to finance, controlling for various firm-specific and macroeconomic \nfactors. \n4  See Table A1 in the Appendix for the full list of countries. \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1160  Beirne, Renzhi, and Volz \n \ndata  and  two  climate-related  indicators  (climate  risk  vulnerability  \nand climate risk resilience). Drawing on the literature that examines the drivers of \nsovereign bond yields and the price of sovereign risk, the macroeconomic controls \ninclude the current account balance, public debt/GDP, the fiscal balance, GDP per \ncapita, and GDP growth. These variables have been attained from Bloomberg, the IMF \nInternational Financial Statistics, the OECD, and China Economic Database (CEIC).5 \nRegarding the climate vulnerability indicator, data for vulnerability to climate risk are \ntaken from a refined version of the ND-GAIN vulnerability index developed by Kling et al. \n(2020). The refined vulnerability measure comprises all of the components from the ND-\nGAIN vulnerability index that are not highly related to economic variables in order to \nmitigate against endogeneity concerns.6 Data for climate resilience are from FTSE \nRussell. This indicator refers to the extent to which an economy has measures in place \nto address exposure to climate risks. Details of the construction of these variables are \nshown in the Appendix (Tables A3 and A4).7  \nThe following baseline equation is estimated: \ny  = \u03b2x  + \u03b3Z  + \u03c7VIX  + \u03c4USY  + CRISIS  + \u03b4 + \u03b5  i=1,\u2026,N, t=1,\u2026,T (1) \ni,t i,t-1 i,t-1 t-1 t-1 i,t-1 i i,t  \nwhere y  represents the government bond yield; x  represents a set of domestic \ni,t i,t\nmacroeconomic  fundamentals;  Z  denotes  our  climate  vulnerability  and  resilience \nj\nindicators; VIX stands for the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index, \na measure of global risk aversion; USY are US long-term government bond yields; \nCRISIS represents the Laeven and Valencia (2018) indicator for the incidence of a crisis \nevent for each country in the sample; \u03b4i are country fixed effects; and \u03b5  is the error term. \ni,t\nThe variables are lagged by one period to mitigate against endogeneity concerns. \nSecond, a structural panel VAR is used to examine the response of sovereign bond \nyields to shocks to climate vulnerability and resilience. Crucially, these shocks control for \na  range  of  macroeconomic  fundamentals  and  global  factors.  The  panel  SVAR  is \nimplemented across the same 40 countries as in stage one, but over the period from \n2007Q1 to 2017Q4 in a balanced set-up. The panel SVAR can be denoted as follows in \nits general specification, with structural shocks identified by a recursive restriction: \n     (2) \nwhere A\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34((L\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f)) \u0394is\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc4c \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56t,\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61he= m\ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56,a\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61trix of lag polynomial; Y  refers to the demeaned value of X of \ni,t t\ncountry i to accommodate country-specific fixed effects; and \u03b5  is a vector of structural \ni,t\ndisturbances.  Following  the setting  of  the  previous  SVAR  model,  we  take  a  first-\ndifferencing form of Y  as \u0394Y . The ordering of the variables imposed in the recursive \ni,t i,t\n \n5  See Table A2 in the Appendix for details of all variables used, including sources. \n6  The original ND-GAIN vulnerability index (Chen et al. 2015) comprises three core measures: (i) the extent \nto  which  an  economy  is  exposed  to  significant  climate  change  from  a  biophysical  perspective;  \n(ii) the degree to which an economy is dependent upon sectors that are particularly sensitive to climate \nchange; and (iii) the extent of an economy\u2019s adaptive capacity to climate change. This measure can \ntherefore be interpreted as an overall measure reflecting both physical and transition climate-related risks. \nWe use the refined measure by Kling et al. (2020) which strips out measures that are highly correlated \nwith macroeconomic variables, so that the new vulnerability index is less correlated with countries\u2019 \nfinancial or economic conditions, which might cause endogeneity. \n7  As can be seen from Tables A3 and A4 in the Appendix, there is largely no overlap in the components of \nthe climate vulnerability and resilience indicators. The only overlap applies to just one component, namely \nthe freshwater withdrawal rate.  \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1160  Beirne, Renzhi, and Volz \n \nform is the same as the previous SVAR model. The panel VAR includes two lags selected \nby the Akaike information criterion (AIC). \nOur  identification  strategy  is  based  on  a  block  recursive  restriction  (Christiano, \nEichenbaum, and Evans 1999), which results in the following matrix   to fit a just-\nidentified model: \n\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e1,1 0 \u2026 0   (3) \n\u23a1 \u23a4\n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e2,1 \u22f1 \u22f1 \u22ee\n\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34 =\u23a2 \u23a5\n\u23a2 \u22ee \u22f1 \u22f1 0 \u23a5\nThe orderin\u23a3g\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e 1o1f, 1the\u2026 var\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4eia11b,1le0s i\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4em1p1,o11s\u23a6ed in the recursive form implies that the variables  \nat the top (such as  ) will not be affected by contemporaneous shocks to the  \nlower variables (such as  ), while the lower variables will be affected by \n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e1,1\ncontemporaneous shocks to the upper variables. Usually, slower moving variables are \nbetter candidates to be or\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4ed2e,1r,e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4ed1 1b,1e,f.o..r e fast-moving variables (Bruno and Shin 2015).  \nIt follows therefore that we place the climate vulnerability variable at the top in the \nordering, which implies that it will only be affected by contemporaneous shock to itself. \nFollowing the vulnerability variable, we place the climate resilience variable second in \nthe ordering, which implies that resilience will be affected by contemporaneous shocks \nto  vulnerability  and  itself,  but  not  by  contemporaneous  shocks  to  macroeconomic \nfundamentals or sovereign bond yields. Importantly, we put the sovereign yields in  \nlast place in the ordering, which is not only based on the assumption that climate risk will \naffect bond yields, but also on the consideration of our first-stage empirical results that \nimply the macroeconomic fundamentals that are driving bond yields. Last, we place our \nmacroeconomic fundamentals in the middle of the ordering. The lag selection of the \nSVAR model is based on the AIC, which suggests that our model should be with two \nlags. \n4.  EMPIRICAL RESULTS \nThe results from the estimation of equation (1) are provided in Table 1.8 The coefficients \non  the  domestic  and  global  factors  accord  largely  with  priors,  and  are  \nalso in alignment with the findings in the related literature. The results are presented \nacross four main country groups: advanced economies, emerging markets, ASEAN, and \na  high  risk  group.9 Across  all  countries  as  a  whole,  controlling  for  domestic  and  \nglobal factors, it is clear that vulnerability to climate risk and resilience to climate risk \nhave significant effects on sovereign bond yields. Increases in vulnerability and lower \nresilience to climate risks lead to rises in bond yields.10 The premium on sovereign bond \nyields from rising climate risk vulnerability is highest for the high risk group at 275 basis \npoints, compared to 155 basis points for ASEAN and 113 basis points for other EMEs. \n \n8  As shown in Figure A5 in the Appendix, the models estimated across all the country groups appear to \nexplain sovereign bond yields well based on a comparison of actual yields and the yields implied by the \nmodels\u2014i.e., the fitted values. \n9  The high risk group is defined as economies that are in the top quartile for climate risk exposure based \non the refined ND-GAIN vulnerability index (Kling et al. 2020). This group comprises the following \ncountries: Japan, the Netherlands, the Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka, Singapore, the Philippines,  \nViet Nam, Thailand, Indonesia, and India. \n10  The direction of the effects is in line with intuition and also reflects the pattern that can be observed from \nraw plots of sovereign bond yields against our climate risk indicators (see Figures A1 to A4 in the \nAppendix). \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1160  Beirne, Renzhi, and Volz \n \nThe effect of vulnerability on bond yields for advanced economies is not statistically \nsignificant.  As  regards  climate  risk  resilience,  the  magnitude  of  the  effect  \non bond yields is substantially lower than that of climate risk vulnerability, with higher \nresilience associated with declines in bond yields by fewer than 10 basis points across \nall country groups.11 \nTable 1: The Determinants of Sovereign Bond Yields \n  (1)  (2)  (3)  (4)  (5) \n  All  ADV  EME  ASEAN  HRSK \nClimate risk vulnerability and resilience \nVulnerability  0.634***  \u20130.001  1.134***  1.549***  2.753*** \n  (0.150)  (0.164)  (0.434)  (0.328)  (0.388) \nResilience  \u20130.067***  \u20130.084***  \u20130.070***  \u20130.057***  \u20130.057*** \n  (0.009)  (0.013)  (0.016)  (0.015)  (0.016) \nDomestic factors \nCurrent account/GDP  \u20130.051***  \u20130.019  \u20130.127***  \u20130.0650***  \u20130.106*** \n  (0.011)  (0.015)  (0.029)  (0.013)  (0.015) \nGDP per capita  \u20130.748*  \u20139.181***  \u20130.265  \u20134.587***  1.049 \n  (0.385)  (0.992)  (0.571)  (0.868)  (0.666) \nPublic debt/GDP  0.016***  0.013***  \u20130.0133*  0.0294***  0.00991*** \n  (0.001)  (0.002)  (0.008)  (0.005)  (0.003) \nFiscal balance/GDP  0.008  \u20130.014  0.172***  \u20130.015  \u20130.023 \n  (0.008)  (0.008)  (0.035)  (0.022)  (0.020) \nGDP growth  \u20130.180***  \u20130.142***  \u20130.242***  \u20130.042  \u20130.042* \n  (0.014)  (0.019)  (0.027)  (0.027)  (0.023) \nCrisis  0.673***  1.325***  \u20130.129  n/a  0.605 \n  (0.203)  (0.226)  (0.377)    (0.743) \nGlobal factors \nUS bond yield  0.803***  0.832***  0.587***  0.282**  0.861*** \n  (0.052)  (0.072)  (0.092)  (0.129)  (0.101) \nVIX  0.049***  0.035***  0.059***  0.006  0.038*** \n  (0.005)  (0.007)  (0.009)  (0.010)  (0.009) \nConstant  \u201314.94**  102.3***  \u201336.96**  \u201330.90*  \u2013142.3*** \n  (7.242)  (13.16)  (17.67)  (17.54)  (20.95) \nObservations  2,399  1,088  949  362  600 \nR-squared  0.296  0.430  0.236  0.573  0.411 \nNumber of countries  40  17  17  6  10 \nCountry fixed effects  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes \nTime effects  No  No  No  No  No \nNote: Standard errors in parentheses; *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. \nSource: Authors, based on estimation of equation (1). \nThe results are striking in two main ways. First, it is apparent that vulnerability to climate \nrisk matters substantially more for the cost of sovereign borrowing than resilience to \nclimate risk. In other words, exposure to the direct effects of climate change remains key, \nwith a sizable and significant impact on the cost of sovereign debt for developing and \nemerging economies. Improving resilience efforts further may help to combat exposure \nto these direct effects and hence bring down the cost of sovereign financing. Second, it \n \n11  Interpretation of the coefficients on vulnerability and resilience applies to a unitary rise in the series\u2019 which \nare standardized between 0 and 1. \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1160  Beirne, Renzhi, and Volz \n \nis clear that the magnitude of the effect on bond yields is notably higher for economies \nthat  are  more  exposed  to  climate  risks.  In  particular,  the  effect  \non bond yields for the high risk group is higher than for EMEs as a whole by a factor  \nof about three, and higher than for ASEAN by a factor of around two. Our findings \ntherefore suggest that those economies that are particularly exposed to climate change \nand have the greatest need for resilience investment face the highest climate risk \npremium on their sovereign borrowing costs. Given that a significant share of the \nfinancing of adaptation and vulnerability reduction measures would have to be borne  \nby the public sector, a higher cost of borrowing could severely hamper these crucial \ninvestments.12 \nTurning  to  the  domestic  macroeconomic  fundamentals,  worsening  current  account \npositions, lower GDP per capita, and lower GDP growth have detrimental effects on the \ncost of sovereign borrowing, increasing yields as expected. Economies with weak net \ninternational investment positions tend to have higher bond yields. Moreover, lower \nlevels of economic development and growth prospects can lead to investor flight, thereby \nincreasing sovereign bond yields. Other important factors affecting bond yields include \nthe public debt/GDP ratio and the fiscal balance. On global factors, positive spillovers \nfrom the US bond market are evident in the majority of cases as expected, similar to \nglobal risk aversion. \nAs  a  robustness  check,  we  also  examine  alternative  measures  of  climate  risk \nvulnerability. These results are provided in Table A5 in the Appendix and are fully \nconsistent with those from our baseline specification. Using measures of physical climate \nrisks and transition risks taken from FTSE Russell (Table A6 in the Appendix), we find \nthat both transition and physical risk are positively and significantly related to sovereign \nbond yields. On transition risks\u2014i.e., risks related to shifting to a low-carbon economy\u2014\nwe find that the magnitudes of the effects on sovereign bond yields are lower on average \nacross our sample of countries than for physical risks or resilience. This may be related \nto the fact that financial markets have not yet fully priced in these risks. Nonetheless, the \neffect that we find is certainly not trivial, in particular for higher risk-exposed groups. On \nphysical risks, we find that the effect on sovereign bond yields is significant in all cases \napart from advanced economies. Exposure to the physical effects of climate risk is clearly \na factor that policymakers should be increasingly aware of. As in our baseline, and as \nexpected, we find that the magnitude of the effect on yields from physical climate risks \nis large for economies deemed to be exposed due to their geographic location and \npropensity for the incidence of natural climate-related disasters. These include the \nASEAN  group  of  countries  in  our  sample,  as  well  as  \nsub-panels deemed high risk (the top quartile of countries based on physical and \ntransition risk exposure) and very high risk (the top decile of countries based on physical \nand transition risk exposure). Indeed, we find that the magnitude of the effect on yields \nis progressively higher as the degree of risk exposure rises, in line with economic \nintuition. \nIn order to understand better the relationship between sovereign bond yields and climate \nrisk exposure and resilience, we delve into this issue further using a structural panel VAR \napproach. Across our full sample, as well as sub-panels, Figure 1 shows the effect on \nsovereign  bond  yields  following  a  one  standard  deviation  shock  on  climate  risk \nvulnerability and resilience. \n \n12  Some have argued that adaptation measures should be conducted by the private sector and that  \nthe role of the government is limited to setting the right incentives (e.g., Tol 2005; Jones, Keen, and Strand \n2013). \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1160  Beirne, Renzhi, and Volz \n \nFigure 1: Response of Sovereign Bond Yields to Climate Risk Vulnerability  \nand Climate Risk Resilience Shocks \nAll countries \n \nAdvanced economies \n \nEmerging economies \n \nASEAN \n \nHigh risk economies \n \nNote: Pink line represents 95% confidence interval. Blue line represents the impulse response of government bond yield \nto shocks. \nSource: Authors. \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1160  Beirne, Renzhi, and Volz \n \nFigure 1 indicates that across the sample of 40 countries, sovereign bond yields respond \npositively to a positive shock imposed on climate risk vulnerability, and negatively to a \npositive  shock  on  resilience,  in  line  with  economic  intuition.  The  shock  becomes \npermanent after around 12 quarters. The direction of the effect of the shocks on bond \nyields is consistent across each of our sub-panels. Moreover, and in line with our stage \none analysis, the magnitude of the effect on bond yields is notably larger for economies \nin the high risk category.  \nFor the high risk economies, the upward effect on yields of the vulnerability shock peaks \nat around six quarters, while for ASEAN and other EMEs, the peak is reached at a longer \nduration of around 15\u201318 quarters, albeit with lower magnitudes. The upward reaction of \nadvanced economy bond yields also peaks after around six quarters. For shocks to \nclimate risk resilience, the downward response of yields is most pronounced after around \nsix quarters for EMEs, ASEAN, and the high risk group, with advanced economy bond \nyields peaking downwards much more quickly after around two quarters. Given that the \neffect of climate risk vulnerability and resilience to climate risk on sovereign bond yields \nis not transitory and does not subside over time, this underscores the importance for \npolicymakers to ramp up efforts aimed at mitigating the effects of physical climate risks. \nWithout such action, the negative ramifications for fiscal sustainability and, as a result, \neconomic growth could be substantial. \n5.  CONCLUSIONS \nThis paper contributes to a better understanding of the effects of climate vulnerability on \nthe price of sovereign risk and fiscal sustainability. Set against the a growing literature \nhighlighting the impacts of climate risks on macroeconomic conditions, this paper tests \nempirically the link between climate vulnerability and resilience to climate risk and \nsovereign bond yields. This is also an important issue to consider in light of the increasing \nincorporation  of  climate  risk  by  credit  risk  agencies  in  their  sovereign  rating \nmethodologies. Using a diverse sample of 40 advanced and emerging economies, many \nof which are particularly vulnerable to climate risks due to their geographical location and \nsusceptibility to natural disasters, our results provide evidence that climate risks and \nresilience to these risks have significant effects on the cost of sovereign borrowing. In \nparticular, higher climate risk vulnerability and, to a lesser extent, lower climate risk \nresilience, lead to significant rises in the cost of sovereign borrowing. Given the material \neffects of climate change on the cost of sovereign borrowing, our analysis indicates that \nmore attention needs to be paid to the incorporation of climate risk into the operational \nframeworks of central banks. Moreover, the issue warrants further consideration by \nfinancial supervisors from a financial stability perspective. Last but not least, our findings \nstrongly suggest that adaptation investments that help to mitigate climate risks would \ncontribute to a lowering of the cost of sovereign debt, and this would provide much-\nneeded fiscal space to those countries particularly affected by climate change. \n   \n9 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1160  Beirne, Renzhi, and Volz \n \nREFERENCES \nAcevedo, S. 2014. \u201cDebt, Growth and Natural Disasters: A Caribbean Trilogy.\u201d IMF \nWorking Paper No. 14/125.

Controlling for a large set of domestic and global factors, we show that both vulnerability and resilience to climate risk are important factors driving the cost of sovereign borrowing at the global level. Overall, we find that vulnerability to the direct effects of climate change matter substantially more than climate risk resilience in terms of the implications for sovereign borrowing costs. Moreover, the magnitude of the effect on bond yields is progressively higher for countries deemed highly vulnerable to climate change. Impulse response analysis from a set of panel structural VAR models indicates that the reaction of bond yields to shocks imposed on climate vulnerability and resilience become permanent after around 12 quarters, with high risk economies experiencing larger permanent effects on yields than other country groups.", "Title": "Feeling the Heat: Climate Risks and the Cost of Sovereign Borrowing"}}
