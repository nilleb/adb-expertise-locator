Contributing to this impressive \neconomic outcome, Vietnam\u2019s bond market continued to grow rapidly and synchronously, \naffirming its role as an effective financing channel for the government, enterprises, sub-\nnational governments and State-owned policy banks. \n\nThe bond market\u2019s size accounted for 40.14 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2019, \na five-fold jump from 2011, saw the bond market\u2019s total financing amount to VND 581,089 \nbillion - equivalent to 9.62 percent of GDP and an increase of 25.7 percent compared to 2018 \nas well as 4.6 times higher than in 2011, while improving liquidity in the secondary market. \nInstruments and the investor base have also become increasingly diversified. \n\nIn an effort to systematically inform investors about the bond market and its dynamics, the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) developed and published the landmark \u201cVietnam Annual Bond \nMarket Report in 2018\u201d. This report was highly appreciated by the investor community, \nmarket members and organizations. For 2019, with support from the World Bank, the Swiss \nState Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) and Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale \nZusammenarbeit (GIZ), the MOF has further enhanced the content, data and format in \ncompiling this \u201cVietnam Bond Market Annual Report 2019\u201d, ensuring a rich and timely source \nof information for investors on development of Vietnam\u2019s bond market.\n\nI hope this report will be an insightful resource and reference point for investors as well as \nothers interested and participating in Vietnam\u2019s bond market.\n\nMinister of Finance \n\nDinh Tien Dzung\n\n\f6\n\nLIST OF ABBREVIATIONS\n\nBIDV  Vietnam Bank for Investment and Development \n\nCPI \n\nConsumer Price Index\n\nDIV  \n\nDeposit Insurance of Vietnam \n\nGDP  Gross Domestic Product\n\nHNX  Hanoi Stock Exchange\n\nHOSE   Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange \n\nICOR  \n\nIncremental Capital-Output Ratio\n\nMOF   Ministry of Finance \n\nOTC \n\nOver-the-counter\n\nPPP  \n\nPublic-Private Partnership\n\nSBV  \n\nState Bank of Vietnam \n\nSECO   State Secretariat for Economic Affairs\n\nSSC  \n\nState Securities Commission \n\nUSD  United States Dollar\n\nVBMA   Vietnam Bond Market Association \n\nVDB \n\nVietnam Development Bank\n\nVND \n\nVietnam Dong\n\nVSD  \n\nVietnam Securities Depository Center \n\nVSPB  Vietnam Social Policy Bank\n\nVSS  \n\nVietnam Social Security Agency \n\n\fPART I\nOVERVIEW OF THE VIETNAM \nBOND MARKET\n\nI. CONCEPTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE BOND MARKET\n\nVietnam\u2019s bond market began to take shape in the mid-1990s, with the Government issuing \na series of construction and national bonds to finance the State budget. During 1990-2000, \nthe State Treasury was the only authorized issuer to raise market finance through short-tenor \nTreasury bills and bonds of less than three years.\n\nAlongside the economy and financial market\u2019s development, the bond market has evolved \ninto two main branches: i) Government bond, Government-guaranteed bond and municipal \nbond markets and ii) the corporate bond market. Both were established and gradually grew \nin response to financing requirements of the Government, State-owned policy banks, sub-\nnational governments and enterprises. \n\nFour main types of issuers operate in the bond market: i) the State Treasury is authorized by \nthe Ministry of Finance (MOF) as the issuer of Government bonds to finance State budget \ndeficits and refinance due debt principals as stipulated in the State Budget Law and Public \nDebt Management Law, ii) State-owned policy banks (Vietnam Social Policy Bank (VSPB) and \nVietnam Development Bank (VDB)) are permitted to issue bonds with Government guarantees \nto  finance  State  policy-targeted  credit  schemes,  iii)  sub-national  People\u2019s  Committees \nof provinces and municipalities issue municipal bonds to fund respective sub-national \ngovernment budgets and iv) incorporated entities issue corporate bonds to service productive \nand commercial investments.\n\nThe investor base consists of financial intermediaries (credit institutions, securities firms, \ninsurance companies and investment funds), Vietnam Social Security Agency (VSS), Deposit \nInsurance of Vietnam (DIV), individual and other investors.\n\nThe Vietnam Bond Market Association (VBMA) is a socio-professional body established in \n2009, whose members are bond market investors and intermediaries - some of whom are \nalso corporate issuers. VBMA acts as a platform for information exchanges and updates, \nto strengthen collaboration among regulators, issuers and investors, provide opinions to \nregulators for enhancements to the legal framework governing the bond market, deliver \nsupport services to its members, deliver training and capacity building for its members and \nengage in cooperation with global and regional bond market associations.\n\nThe Vietnam Securities Depository Center (VSD), Hanoi Stock Exchange (HNX) and Ho Chi \nMinh Stock Exchange (HOSE) are service providers for bond registration, custody, listing and \ntrading for issuers. Accordingly, HNX and VSD organize and operate platforms for government, \ngovernment-guaranteed and municipal bond primary issuance, registration, custody listing \nand trading in the secondary market as well as making interest and principal payments on debt \n\n\f8\n\nV I E T N A M   B O N D   M A R K E T   2 0 1 9\n\ninstruments and clearing debt instrument transactions. Corporate bonds can be registered and \ndeposited at the VSD and listed and traded on the HNX and HOSE.\n\nBond market products have increasingly diversified in response to investors\u2019 demands and \nthe increasing debt-carrying capacity of issuers. As for Government bonds, a full range of \ntenors were observed, ranging from T-bills of less than 364 days to bonds with 30-year tenors, \nGovernment-guaranteed bonds have fixed-rate tenors from two to 15 years and municipal \nbonds from three to 30 years. The corporate bond market boasts a full range of products \nencompassing fixed to variable rates, secured and guaranteed bonds. \n\nIntermediary institutions in the capital and bond markets have emerged and developed with \nparticipation of securities firms, fund management companies, investment funds pension \nfunds and credit rating agencies.\n\nThe institutional and policy framework has been steadily reformed with increasingly diversified \nproducts and steadfast growth in intermediary institutions and market infrastructure. During \n2011-2019, the bond market developed in depth and breadth with an annual average growth \nrate of 24 percent. The Government bond market\u2019s 31 percent average annual growth was a \nparticularly eye-catching feature, with the corporate bond market posting an average annual \ngrowth rate of 26 percent. \n\nThe bond market\u2019s size expanded from just 2.82 percent of GDP in 2001 to 17.36 percent in \n2011 and upward to 40.14 percent in 2019. By the end of 2019, the Government bond market\u2019s \nsize equalled 26.54 percent of GDP, followed by corporate bonds (10.85 percent), Government-\nguaranteed bonds (2.43 percent) and municipal bonds (0.32 percent).\n\nFIGURE 1  Bond market sizes relative to GDP \n\n45.00%\n\n40.00%\n\n35.00%\n\n30.00%\n\n25.00%\n\n20.00%\n\n15.00%\n\n10.00%\n\n5.00%\n\n0.00%\n\n37.00%\n\n37.69%\n\n39.55% 40.14%\n\n27.33% 27.59% 27.25%\n\n26.54%\n\n24.13%\n\n16.19%\n\n21.27%\n\n13.84%\n\n19.08%\n\n11.26%\n\n17.60%\n\n16.59%\n\n8.16%\n\n5.45%\n3.75%\n\n9.52%\n\n4.85%\n1.96%\n\n0.24%\n\n0.26%\n\n4.63%\n\n2.73%\n0.46%\n\n4.30%\n2.53%\n0.60%\n\n3.85%\n\n3.40%\n\n0.69%\n\n9.01%\n\n10.85%\n\n6.29%\n\n5.36%\n\n3.68%\n\n3.31%\n\n2.85%\n\n2.43%\n0.44% 0.32%\n\n0.63%\n\n0.50%\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nWhole market\nCorporate bond\n\nGovernment bond\nMunicipal bond\n\nGovernment guaranteed bond\n\n\fP A R T   I   \u2013   O V E R V I E W   O F   T H E   V I E T N A M   B O N D   M A R K E T\n\n9\n\n1. GOVERNMENT BONDS, GOVERNMENT-GUARANTEED BONDS AND MUNICIPAL BONDS \n\nGovernment bonds (Government debt instruments): Can be issued by the State Treasury \nvia three methods: i) auctioning on securities exchanges, ii) underwriting and iii) private \nplacement. Upon the specialized Government bond market\u2019s establishment in 2009, the \nauctioning and listing of tradable Government bonds have taken place on the HNX, with \nregistration, custody, interest and principal payments and clearing services performed by \nVSD. Currently, most Government bonds are issued through auctions, listed and traded \non the Government bond market-specialized HNX. Primary Dealers: According to a new \nregulation  in  Decree  No.95/2018/ND-CP,  from  2019  a  system  of  primary  dealers  was \nestablished (previously referred to as \u201cGovernment bond auctioning members\u201d), consisting \nof commercial banks and securities firms satisfying eligibility conditions and selected from \nannual short-lists issued by the MOF, as exclusive participants in Government bond auctions \non behalf of themselves or for their customers. \n\nCurrently, key Government bond investors consist of commercial banks, VSS, DIV and \ninsurance companies. In recent years, Government bond holdings amongst commercial \nbanks have declined considerably, while those of non-bank financial institutions (VSS, DIV, \ninsurance companies, investment funds) are trending up, which demonstrates the improving \ndiversity of the investor base within the Government bond market.\n\nGovernment-guaranteed bonds: Are issued via auctions on the HNX, registered and deposited \nat the VSD, listed and traded on the HNX - as are Government bonds. Currently, the Vietnam \nDevelopment Bank and Vietnam Social Policy Bank are the two organizations issuing \ngovernment-guarantee bonds on the HNX.\n\nSimilar to Government bond auctions, Primary Dealers are exclusive members permitted to \nparticipate in Government-guaranteed bond auctions on behalf of themselves or customers. \nOther dealers and investors can purchase Government-guaranteed bonds from or via \nPrimary Dealers. Government-guaranteed bond investors are primarily commercial banks, \ninsurers and securities firms.\n\nMunicipal bonds: Can be issued through one of two methods: (i) auctioned via the securities \nexchanges and (ii) underwriting. After issuance on the primary market, bonds are registered \nand put into VSD custody, listed and traded in securities exchanges and when requested by \nthe issuer. Most municipal bond investors are commercial banks.\n\n2. CORPORATE BONDS  \n\nThe corporate bond market can be viewed as two components: i) private placement and ii) \npublic offerings. \n\nFor public offerings of bonds,  the State Securities Commission (SSC) issues registration \ncertificates for offerings of bonds and/or provides opinions on plans for offerings of privately-\nplaced convertible bonds, privately-placed bonds with warrants of public companies, directly \nmonitors public offerings and private placements of bonds in public companies. \n\nFor privately-placed bonds, the enterprise is not required to be licensed by regulators and \nonly needs to comply with regulations on conditions, issuance process and full disclosure of \ninformation as prescribed by law. Regarding international market bond issuances, issuing \ncompanies must register with the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) for compliance with external \n\n\f1 0\n\nV I E T N A M   B O N D   M A R K E T   2 0 1 9\n\ncommercial borrowing limits and issuing bonds in accordance with regulations of the issuing \nmarket.\n\nBond-issuing  enterprises,  under  the  principles  of  self-borrowing,  self-repayment  and \nresponsibilities to debt-carrying capacity and solvency through compliance with eligibility \nconditions, must fully disclose information as stipulated by regulations. Enterprises can issue \nbonds through: i) auctioning, ii) underwriting and iii) direct placement with investors. At each \nstage, corporate bond regulations are subject to change, yet their cross-cutting objectives are \nprotection of investor interests, transparency, corporate bond market openness and facilitation \nof company financing. \n\nInvestors must self-assess the risks of investing in bonds, restrictions on trading bonds invested \nand take responsibility for their investment decisions. The corporate bond market investor base \nconsists of commercial banks as well as insurance companies, securities investment funds, \nindividuals and other organizations. The share of commercial bank holdings of corporate \nbonds has declined in recent years, a sign of growing interest from other (domestic and \nexternal) investors in local corporate bonds, including individual investors. Corporate bonds are \ninvestment products suitable for professional investors who have financial capacity, investment \nexperience and an ability to analyze and take risks. As for individual investors, they are advised \nto only buy corporate bonds when they have the requisite financial knowledge, investment \nexperience, ability to analyze and take risks.\n\nIntermediary and service institutions that assist the development of the corporate bond market \nare established and developing, including credit ratings agencies, advisory service providers, \ndepository agencies, underwriters for bond issuances as well as bond settlement and private \nplaced corporate bond information center1.\n\nII. GOVERNMENT BOND, GOVERNMENT-GUARANTEED BOND AND \nMUNICIPAL BOND MARKETS\n\n1. GOVERNMENT BOND MARKET \n\nUnder the Public Debt Management Law,  Government debt instruments - which include \nTreasury bonds, Treasury bills and national construction bonds - are issued regularly to finance \nthe State budget.\n\nThe Government bond market plays a pivotal role in development of the overall bond market, \ndue to solid foundations anchored in its legal framework, primary and secondary markets, \ninfrastructure and investor base. The Government is the overarching and most frequent issuer \nin the bond market, with an annual average Government bond issuing value of VND 203,712 \nbillion during 2011-2018.\n\n1.1 Legal framework\n\nFrom July 1, 2018, Government bond issuances and transactions are governed by the Public \nDebt Management Law 2017, Decree No.95/2018/ND-CP (June 30, 2018), promulgating \nregulations on the issuance, registration, custody, listing and trading of Government debt \n\n1  The corporate bond information center is based at the HNX.\n\n\fP A R T   I   \u2013   O V E R V I E W   O F   T H E   V I E T N A M   B O N D   M A R K E T\n\n1 1\n\ninstruments in securities markets and other guideline circulars (please refer to Annex 1: the list of \nlegal and regulatory documents governing the issuance and transactions of Government bonds).\n\n1.2. Market  features\n\nIssuance plan: The annual Government bond issued volume is determined by the State budget \nplan enacted by the National Assembly and cognizance of bond market conditions. In view of \nthe State budget financing mandate, the MOF decides Government bond issued volumes and \nmandates the State Treasury to prepare and disclose the annual bond issuance and tentative \nquarterly bond issuance plans on the websites of the Vietnam State Treasury (http://vst.mof.gov.\nvn) and HNX (https://hnx.vn/en-gb/trai-phieu.html). \n\nAuctions calendar: At the beginning of each year, the State Treasury notifies Primary Dealers \nof the annual auctions calendar broken down by weeks to allow the latter to actively plan \nengagement in Government bond auctions performed each Wednesday morning (excluding \npublic holidays and festivals as stipulated by legislation). \n\nIssuing methods: In alignment with regulations, Government bonds can be issued through \nauctions, underwriting and private placements. The former is the most common method, while \nunderwriting is used to launch new products on the market.\n\nIssuance auctions: Are conducted on the trading system of HNX. Multiple-price or uniform-price \nauctions can be applied. The latter is more common, with the uniform cut-off rate determined \nas the auction result for all successful bidders. \n\nCognizant of members\u2019 financing needs and bids, the State Treasury immediately after each \nmorning auction can announce an additional afternoon session on the same day if within \napproved limits. In additional auction sessions, the fresh issued volume can be up to 50 \npercent of the original offered volume for each bond code, depending on State Treasury cash \nmanagement and investor demand.\n\nUnderwriting  method  of  bond  issuances:  Is  conducted  via  a  lead  underwriter  and/or \nco-underwriter(s) that can solicit potential investors and act on behalf of an underwriting \nsyndicate  to  sign  the  underwriting  contract  and  distribute  bonds  to  members  as  per \ninternational practice (please refer to issuing procedures in Annex 3 and Annex 4).\n\nPrimary Dealers\u2019 roles, rights and obligations: Primary Dealers are organizations selected by the \nMOF to exercise the rights and obligations to issue and trade government debt instruments \nin the domestic market under provisions of Decree No.95/2018/ND-CP and MOF guidance to \ncreate liquidity in the primary and secondary markets for Government bonds.\n\nAs for the rights, in addition to being exclusive participants in Government bond auctions, \nPrimary Dealers are also prioritized to act as lead underwriters in auctions and in buybacks and \nswitching of Government bonds as well as engage with State regulators on market regulations. \nIn fulfilment of obligations to quote firmly committed prices whilst having insufficient \nGovernment bonds for a trade, Primary Dealers can request the State Treasury issue benchmark \nbonds to support market liquidity. \n\nAs for the obligations, Primary Dealers are obliged to quote firmly committed bid-ask prices \nfor benchmark bonds in the secondary market to create market liquidity as well as purchase \nand trade Government bonds in minimum volumes specified for each period by the MOF. \nSuch quotations are stipulated by Decree No.95/2018/ND-CP, MOF guidelines and State \n\n\f1 2\n\nV I E T N A M   B O N D   M A R K E T   2 0 1 9\n\nTreasury announcements of benchmark bonds, start and end dates for firmly committed price \nquotations, frequency and volumes of firmly committed price quotations for each benchmark \nbond and the maximum spread for calculations of firmly committed bid-ask prices.2 Annually, \nthe MOF evaluates the performance of obligations to rank and publish the list of Primary \nDealers.\n\nConditions and procedures for registration of Primary Dealers: Commercial banks and securities \ncompanies that meet conditions for purchasing Government debt instruments in the primary \nmarket and trading on the secondary market with minimum amounts prescribed by the MOF \nin each period, have contributed sufficient charter capital, have operated for three years or \nmore and aspire to be a Primary Dealer should send a dossier to the MOF within the period of \nNovember 1-10 each year. The MOF assesses the satisfaction of conditions specified in Decree \nNo.95/2018/ND-CP and publishes the list of Primary Dealers before December 31 every year.\n\nInstruments: Government bond market products include Treasury bills with tenors of up to 364 \ndays, Government bonds with tenors of two, three, five, seven, 10, 15, 20 and 30 years (20- and \n30-year tenors were first issued in 2015). Fixed-rate bonds can have short or long first coupons. \nIn addition to fixed-rate Government bond products, zero-coupon bonds have been issued. \nIn view of Government bond portfolio restructuring and investor base diversification policies, \nissued volumes of Government bonds with longer tenors of at least five years or more account \nfor an increasing share of annual issued volumes.\n\nSettlement, registration and custody processes: Government bond auctions are settled via the \nSBV\u2019s Banking Operations Center. The auction date is T, the settlement date of Government \nbond purchases via auctions is the day after the auction (T+1), and Government bonds are \nlisted and traded on the HNX on the day after (T+2) the settlement date. Government bonds \nare registered and deposited with the VSD, while secondary market purchases are settled via \nthe SBV\u2019s Banking Operations Center on the day after the trade date (T+1).\n\nSecondary market transactions: The four types of Government bond transactions are: i) outright, \nii) repo, iii) sale and repurchase repo and iv) lending and borrowing transactions, with the first \nand third most common. Government bonds are traded via electronic and common put-\nthrough methods, with the latter seeing investors negotiate transaction conditions and enter \nthe result into HNX\u2019s Government bond trading platform for transaction establishment. \n\nBond buybacks and switching: Government bonds can be bought back and switched as \narranged by the State Treasury under initiatives approved by the Prime Minister through \nnegotiations or auctions. Specific procedures for Government bond buybacks or switching are \nspecified in MOF guideline circulars.  \n\n1.3. Market overview (2011-2018)\n\nGovernment bond market operations, driven by legal framework refinement, have witnessed \nfundamental reforms to instrument types, processes and procedures for bond issuances, \nregistration, custody, listing, trading and the investor base. During 2011-2018, total issued \nvolumes of Government bonds amounted to VND 1,972 trillion (or VND 220 trillion per year on \naverage) accounting for 60-70 percent of annual State budget financing volumes.  \n\n2  Primary Dealer market making and Vietnam State Treasury liquidity support are in the pre-implementation \n\nphase.\n\n\fP A R T   I   \u2013   O V E R V I E W   O F   T H E   V I E T N A M   B O N D   M A R K E T\n\n1 3\n\nInstruments: Prior to 2014, Government bonds were mainly issued in short- to medium-term \ntenors of less than 10 years. Subsequently, longer-term bonds were prioritized to lengthen \nthe average term to maturity of the Government bond portfolio, starting with issuances of 20- \nand 30-year tenors in 2015. Following National Assembly Resolution No.25/2016/NQ-QH on \napproval of the five-year national financial plan for 2016-2020, Government bonds have been \nissued with tenors of five years or more, while Treasury bills have not been issued since 2017. \nAs a result, the average issuing maturity of Government bonds has lengthened to increase \nportfolio debt sustainability. In addition, several Government bond sizes have grown to VND \n10,000 billion and can be re-opened on tap during three to four-month periods depending on \nmarket conditions. Bond sizes are forecast to further expand to establish benchmark bonds \nsuitable for market development. \n\nFIGURE 2  Proportion of Government bonds issued by tenors (2011-2018)\n\n60,00%\n\n50,00%\n\n40,00%\n\n30,00%\n\n20,00%\n\n10,00%\n\n0,00%\n\nUnder 1yr\n\n2yr\n\n3yr\n\n5yr\n\n7yr\n\n10yr\n\n15yr\n\n20yr\n\n30yr\n\n30.00%\n\n25.00%\n\n20.00%\n\n15.00%\n\n10.00%\n\n5.00%\n\n0.00%\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nFIGURE 3  Government bond issuing volumes and \noutstanding (2011-2018)\n\nIssuing methods: Government bonds during \n2011-2018  were  mainly  issued  by  HNX \nauctions. To launch new market products \n(bonds with 20- and 30-year tenors, zero-\ncoupon  bonds),  the  State  Treasury  may \narrange  underwriting  method  issuing \nsessions before conducting auctions.\n\nThe secondary market for Government bonds \ngradually emerged with increasing volumes \nacross 2011-2018. The average transaction \nvolume in 2018 was VND 7,432 billion per \ntrading session, while the average transaction \nvolume  for  Government,  Government-\nguaranteed and municipal bonds was VND \n9,000 billion per trading session.

Since August 2017, VSD settled Government bond \ntransactions via the SBV by inter-bank settlements for each transaction. \n\nThe secondary market IT platform has been upgraded to facilitate a shortened period from the \ndate of bond auction to the date the bond can be traded from 10 days (T+10 in 2009) to only \ntwo days (T+2 from 2015).\n\nTABLE 1  Government bond trading volumes in secondary market (2011-2018) (Unit: VND billion)\n\n \n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nOutright transactions\n\n45,268\n\n115,857\n\n290,847\n\n562,281\n\n504,985\n\n831,220\n\n1,036,792 899,244\n\nRepo transactions\n\n827\n\n18,101\n\n57,501\n\n176,177\n\n219,447\n\n459,642\n\n866,481\n\n958,933\n\nTotal transaction value\n\n46,095\n\n133,958\n\n348,348\n\n738,458\n\n724,432\n\n1,290,862 1,903,273 1,858,177\n\nAverage transaction \nvalue per session\n\n186\n\n536\n\n1,393\n\n2,990\n\n2,921\n\n5,143\n\n7,613\n\n7,432\n\nBuyback and switching operations: The State Treasury during  2011-2018 also conducted bond \nswitching operations to enhance market liquidity and public debt consolidation with a volume \nof VND 12,802 billion. \n\nInvestor base: The MOF initiated a series of steps during 2014-2018 to restructure the investor \nbase composition towards sustainability. This was achieved through drawing down the \nholdings of short-term Government bond investors and increasing those of long-term non-\nbank financial institution investors through: (i) prioritizing issuance of long tenor Government \nbonds when market conditions were favorable and (ii) converting VSS loans into bonds. As a \nresult, compared to pre-2016 when the majority of Government bond market investors were \ncommercial banks, this player\u2019s holdings have since decreased over the years (76.7 percent in \n2015, 55.4 percent (2016), 52.7 percent (2017) and 47.8 percent in 2018). While non-resident \ninvestors also participate in the Government bond market, they only hold around 1 percent of \nthe portfolio (Annex 5 explains non-resident investors\u2019 participation).\n\nFIGURE 4  Composition of investors in Government bond market (2011-2018)\n\n120.00%\n\n100.00%\n\n80.00%\n\n60.00%\n\n40.00%\n\n20.00%\n\n0.00%\n\nOther\n\nInsurance\n\nCommercial banks\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n\fP A R T   I   \u2013   O V E R V I E W   O F   T H E   V I E T N A M   B O N D   M A R K E T\n\n1 5\n\n2. GOVERNMENT-GUARANTEED BOND MARKET \n\nThe  nascent  market for Government-guaranteed bonds emerged from 2009 when the \nGovernment provided guarantees for two policy banks issuing bonds to raise funds for State-\ntargeted credit schemes in compliance with the Public Debt Management Law. Since 2011, the \nGovernment-guaranteed bond market has operated smoothly with an average annual issued \nvolume of VND 38 trillion.    \n\n2.1. Legal framework\n\nDuring  2011-2017,  Government-guaranteed  bond  issuances  complied  with  the  2009 \nPublic Debt Management Law, Decree No.01/2011/ND-CP on issuances of Government, \nGovernment-guaranteed and municipal bonds as well as applicable MOF circulars. Since \nJuly 1, 2018  issuances of Government-guaranteed bonds were governed by the 2017 \nPublic Debt Management Law, Decree No.91/2018/ND-CP (June 26, 2018) on issuance \nand management of Government guarantees. Accordingly, the Government shall issue \nguarantees for enterprises issuing bonds to finance investment projects eligible against \ncriteria of investment policy decision-making authorities, overdue debt, debt-to-equity ratio, \nbusiness performance and minimum equity requirements for project participation. The two \npolicy banks (VDB and VSPB) are also Government guaranteed for bond issuances to finance \nState credit schemes. \n\nPolicy  bank-issued  government-guaranteed  bonds  shall  follow  auction  procedures \napplicable to Government bonds. For enterprises, issuances of Government-guaranteed \nbonds follow securities legislation as per public offerings of bonds. \n\n2.2. Market overview (2011-2018) \n\nDuring 2011-2018, only the two policy banks were Government-guaranteed for bond \nissuances  to  finance  State  credit  schemes. The  total  issued  volume  of  Government-\nguaranteed bonds during this period was VND 270,768 billion, equivalent to an average \nVND  38,681  billion  per  year,  essentially \nresponsive to policy banks\u2019 financing needs \nfor implementation of State-targeted credit \nschemes.\n\nFIGURE 5 \nguaranteed bonds (2011-2018)\n\nIssuing volumes of Government-\n\n180,000\n160,000\n140,000\n120,000\n100,000\n80,000\n60,000\n40,000\n20,000\n0\n\nIssuance plan: In light of the Prime Minister-\napproved annual bond issuing limits, the two \npolicy banks shall announce pre-issuance \ninformation on the HNX and home websites. \nInformation for disclosure includes issued \nvolumes, tenors, auction calendar, coupon \ndates and principal repayments. \n\nInstruments: In the Government-guaranteed \nbond market, products range from two- to \n15-year tenors (10- and 15-year tenors issued \nfrom 2014). Common issuing tenors are five-, \n10- and 15-years. \n\nIssuing methods: Policy banks issue bonds \nthrough HNX auctions, with  a uniform price \n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nIssuing volume (VND billion)\n\nOutstanding (VND billion)\n\nOutstanding to GDP\n\n6.00%\n\n5.00%\n\n4.00%\n\n3.00%\n\n2.00%\n\n1.00%\n\n0.00%\n\n\f1 6\n\nV I E T N A M   B O N D   M A R K E T   2 0 1 9\n\nauction method similar to that for Government bonds. A uniform interest rate is applicable for \nall successful bidders. \n\nWeekly auction dates are selected by the two policy banks, with the VSPB typically conducting \nauctions on Mondays and VDB on Fridays. \n\nTrading and settlement: Government-guaranteed bonds are settled and traded in the secondary \nmarket using uniform procedures for trading and settlement of Government bonds. Bond \npurchase payments are settled on T+1, listed and traded in the securities market on T+2, and \npayments cleared via the SBV. During 2011-2018, trading volumes have generally increased in \nthe secondary market as shown in Table 2.\n\nTABLE 2  Transaction volumes of Government-guaranteed bonds (2011-2018) (Unit: VND billion)\n\n \n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nOutright transactions\n\n42,430\n\n45,568\n\n47,405\n\n74,350\n\n98,095\n\n158,725\n\n102,212\n\n111,232\n\nRepo transactions\n\n766\n\n18,779\n\n69,445\n\n77,932\n\n143,542\n\n240,709\n\n209,876\n\nTotal transaction value\n\n43,196\n\n66,184\n\n143,795\n\n176,027\n\n302,266\n\n342,921\n\n321,108\n\n32,188\n\n77,756\n\nAverage transaction \nvalue per session\n\n174\n\n311\n\n265\n\n582\n\n710\n\n1,204\n\n1,372\n\n1,284\n\nInvestor base: Government-guaranteed bond investors are chiefly commercial banks that buy \naround 90 percent of total issued volumes, while insurers and securities firms account for 10 \npercent.\n\n3. MUNICIPAL BOND MARKET \n\nAlongside development of the Government bond market, the local government bond market \nis gradually developing in response to infrastructure financing needs, with Ho Chi Minh City \nthe first sub-national government to issue municipal bonds in 2003. By now, eight sub-national \ngovernments (Ba Ria-Vung Tau, Bac Ninh, Danang, Dong Nai, Haiphong, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh \nCity and Quang Ninh) had issued municipal bonds to finance projects as part of respective \nbudget expenditure mandates.  \n\n3.1. Legal framework\n\nFrom July 1, 2018, municipal bond issuances have followed the 2017 Public Debt Management \nLaw,  Decree  No.93/2018/ND-CP  (June  30,  2018)  on  sub-national  government  debt \nmanagement and other regulatory guidelines on Government bond issuances. As stipulated \nin the 2017 Public Debt Management Law and 2015 State Budget Law, People\u2019s Committees \nof provinces and cities are permitted to issue municipal bonds to finance respective budget \ndeficits and/or refinance sub-national government debt principals. The bond issued volume \nmust be within the annual sub-national government debt limit approved by the National \nAssembly. Issuing municipal bonds is one of the means to raise capital for local governments \nunder provisions of the State Budget Law and Law on Public Debt Management. \n\n3.2. Municipal bond market overview (2011-2018)   \n\nThe total issued volume of municipal bonds in the primary market amounted to VND 35,384 \nbillion during this period, equivalent to an annual average of VND 5,054 billion, partially \nresponsive to financing needs of sub-national governments. Ho Chi Minh City was the biggest \nissuer in the municipal bond market with an issued volume of VND 18,110 billion.\n\n\fP A R T   I   \u2013   O V E R V I E W   O F   T H E   V I E T N A M   B O N D   M A R K E T\n\n1 7\n\nIssuance plan: Subject to sub-national government annual budget revenue and expenditure \nplans, annual debt borrowing and repayment plans as well as bond issuance plans approved \nby the People\u2019s Council, People\u2019s Committee of a province or city shall announce its municipal \nbond issuance plan five days prior to the auction issuing date or one working day prior to the \nunderwriting issuing date for potential investors to register. The municipal bond issuance plan \nis published on the website of HNX where the auction will take place, website(s) of the sub-\nnational government or issuing agent as authorized by the sub-national government. \n\nInstruments: In the municipal bond market, products range from three- to 30-year tenors \nwith fixed rate (three-, five-, seven-, 10-, 15-, 20- and 30-years). The majority of sub-national \ngovernments issue bonds with five-year tenors, accounting for 50 percent of total issued \nvolumes. Only Ho Chi Minh City has successfully issued bonds with 10- to 30-year tenors, \naccounting for 21.1 percent of total issued volumes. \n\nIssuing method(s): Most  sub-national  governments  issue  municipal  bonds  through  the \nunderwriting method. Only Ba Ria-Vung Tau, Danang and Hanoi have issued bonds through \nHNX auctions. \n\nTABLE 3  Transaction volumes of municipal bonds (2011-2018) (Unit: VND billion)\n\n \n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nOutright transactions\n\nRepo transactions\n\nTotal transaction value\n\nAverage transaction \nvalue per session\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n2,434.13\n\n15,968\n\n2,902.64\n\n1,284\n\n-\n\n1,455\n\n2,614.60\n\n336\n\n2,434.13\n\n17,423\n\n5,517.24\n\n1,620\n\n2017\n\n3,018\n\n752\n\n3,770\n\n2018\n\n551\n\n33.54\n\n585\n\n9.74\n\n70.54\n\n22.25\n\n6.45\n\n15.08\n\n2.34\n\nTransaction and settlement: Municipal bonds are traded and settled in the secondary \nmarket as per Government bonds.

CORPORATE BOND MARKET \n\nThe corporate bond market started to emerge in 2000 in response to the financing needs \nof enterprises. With legal framework enhancements over time, since 2011 this market \nhas expanded robustly and since 2017 it has reached a vibrant state in response to a full \nspectrum of enterprises\u2019 financing needs.\n\n1. LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n\nAs regulatory stipulated, enterprises can issue corporate bonds by public offerings or private \nplacements.\n\n1.1.

OVERVIEW OF CORPORATE BOND MARKET (2011-2018)\n\nThe total issued volume of corporate bonds during 2011-2018 was VND 643,524 billion, an \nannual average of VND 80,440 billion, mostly issued by private placement. While the issued \nvolume by public offering method reached VND 23,936 billion (VND 3,000 billion annual \naverage), private placement issuances  hit VND 619,588 billion (VND 77,448 billion annual \naverage). \n\nIssuance plans: There were 1,676 registrations for corporate bond issuances in the domestic \nmarket during this period, with a total registered issuing value of VND 1,146,924 billion.\n\nInstruments: In the corporate bond market, products range from one- to 15-year tenors, \nwith two-, three- and five-year tenors most common and relevant to investment project \ncycles of enterprises. \n\nIssuing interest rate: Most issuing enterprises adopted floating rates on the basis of interest \nrates for one-year deposits offered by State-owned commercial banks, plus a margin of 2-4 \npercent per year. \n\n\f2 0\n\nV I E T N A M   B O N D   M A R K E T   2 0 1 9\n\nFIGURE 7  Volumes of corporate bonds issued and bonds outstanding (2011-2018)\n\n600,000\n\n500,000\n\n400,000\n\n300,000\n\n200,000\n\n100,000\n\n0\n\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\n \n\nb\nD\nN\nV\n\n10.00%\n\n9.00%\n\n8.00%\n\n7.00%\n\n6.00%\n\n5.00%\n\n4.00%\n\n3.00%\n\n2.00%\n\n1.00%\n\n0.00%\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nIssuing volume\n\nOutstanding\n\nOutstanding to GDP\n\nIssuing methods: Most enterprises issued by the non-underwriting method, in which a \nsecurities firm or commercial bank plays the role of advisory service provider and agent for \nbond distribution and custody. \n\nTrading and settlement: Secondary market trading of corporate bonds issued by private \nplacement was limited, as investors tended to buy and hold to maturity. Settlement of bond \npurchases is undertaken via the underwriter.\n\nInformation on transactions of corporate bonds issued in the market is limited as the \ncorporate bond-dedicated website has yet to gather information on corporate bonds \ntrading.\n\nInvestor base: Investors that purchase corporate bonds are mainly commercial banks (40-\n45 percent of total bonds outstanding), securities firms (35-40 percent of total bonds \noutstanding), insurance companies and retail investors. \n\nIV. GREEN BOND MARKET\n\nThe green bond market in Vietnam began to form in 2016 with Ho Chi Minh City and Ba \nRia-Vung Tau province piloting the issuance of green municipal bonds to raise capital for \nnumerous environmental protection projects as part of respective budget expenditure \nmandates.\n\nDevelopment of the green bond market is one of the key steps to develop the bond \nmarket as per the bond market roadmap for 2017-2020, with a vision to 2030 approved by \nthe Prime Minister in Decision No.1191/QD-TTg (August 14, 2017).\n\n\fP A R T   I   \u2013   O V E R V I E W   O F   T H E   V I E T N A M   B O N D   M A R K E T\n\n2 1\n\n1. LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n\nIn order to meet the capital mobilization needs of the Government, local governments \nand enterprises in servicing rapid and sustainable economic development, the legal \nframework on green bond issuances encompassing Government bonds, municipal bonds \nand corporate bonds has been issued as a basis for the Government, local authorities and \nbusinesses to raise capital through issuing green bonds.\n\n1.1. Issuance of green government bonds\n\nIn Decree No.95/2018/ND-CP (June 30, 2018) on the issuance, registration, depository, \nlisting  and  trading  of  government  debt  instruments  on  the  stock  market,  Article  21 \nstipulates the process for issuing green government bonds and the content for issuing \ngreen  government  bond  schemes,  in  which  the  issuance,  registration,  depository, \nlisting and trading of green government bonds are similar to those of Government debt \ninstruments.\n\n1.2. Issuance of green municipal bonds\n\nIn  Decree  No.93/2018/ND-CP  (June  30,  2018)  stipulating  debt  management  of  local \ngovernments, Article 8 states the issuance of green bonds must comply with the same \nregulations  for  ordinary  municipal  bonds  and  provincial  People\u2019s  Committees  must \nreport lists of projects using green municipal bond issuance capital under MOF guidance. \nAccordingly, the issuance of green municipal bonds must comply with a scheme approved \nby the Prime Minister and guided by the MOF.\n\n1.3. Issuance of green corporate bonds\n\nDecree No.163/2018/ND-CP (December 4, 2018) stipulating the issuance of corporate \nbonds that regulates the issuance of green corporate bonds includes the principle of \nissuance and use of proceeds, information disclosure. The issuance, registration, deposit, \nlisting and transactions of green corporate bonds are similar to those of ordinary corporate \nbonds.\n\n2. IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS\n\nIn 2016, Ho Chi Minh City issued VND 3,000 billion in 15-year municipal bonds to raise \ncapital for projects as part of respective budget expenditure mandates, including 11 \nenvironmental protection projects. Also in 2016, Ba Ria-Vung Tau province issued VND \n500 billion in five-year bonds to raise capital for projects under local budget spending, \nincluding one environmental protection project.\n\nPrior  to  2018, however, the Government and enterprises have not implemented the \nissuance of green bonds. In order to develop and implement new regulations on the \nissuance of green bonds (green government bonds, green local government bonds, green \ncorporate bonds), the MOF has actively participated in forums on developing the green \nbond market regionally and globally. Moreover, the MOF engaged with market participants \nand enterprises on the need to invest and issue green bonds as well as achieve the ASEAN \nGreen Bond Standard and ICMA Green Bond Principles as the basis for issuance. The list of \ngreen projects and green taxonomy was also studied for development in accordance with \ncommon practices and current context of Vietnam.\n\n\fPART II\nBOND MARKET OPERATIONS\nIN 2019  \n\nI. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN 2019\n\n1. MACROECONOMIC SITUATION IN 2019\n\nIn 2019, the global economy and trade growth slowed, while trade tensions among major \neconomies increased. The domestic economy faced difficulties caused by natural disasters \nand climate change. However, the economy continued to post strong growth with stable \nmacroeconomic indicators.\n\nGDP growth in 2019 hit 7.02 percent (with first, second, third and fourth quarter growth at 6.82, \n6.73, 7.48 and 6.97 percent, respectively), exceeding the National Assembly target of 6.6 to 6.8 \npercent. This year\u2019s growth rate is lower than 2018\u2019s 7.08 percent, but higher than seen during \n2011-2017.\n\nThe quality of economic growth improved in step with strong GDP growth and other stable \nmacroeconomic indicators. The average Consumer Price Index (CPI) in 2019 increased by 2.79 \npercent compared to the average in 2018, lower than the target set by the National Assembly \nand was the lowest CPI in the past three years. State budget revenues exceeded 9.9 percent of \nthe estimate, the State budget deficit was controlled at 3.36 percent and the public debt-GDP \nratio was 54.8 percent.\n\nMobilizing capital from society reached 33.9 percent of GDP, of which the non-State sector \naccounted for 46 percent. Foreign direct investment reached USD 38 billion, a 7.2 percent \nincrease compared to 2018, realized capital reached USD 20.4 billion (USD 19.1 billion in 2018) \nand the ICOR coefficient in 2019 was 6.07 (average of 6.14 during 2016-2019).\n\n2. FINANCIAL AND MONETARY MARKET SITUATION\n\nVietnam\u2019s stock market maintained good growth momentum. By the end of 2019, stock market \ncapitalization reached VND 4,390 trillion, a rise of 11.5 percent - equivalent to 72.6 percent of \nGDP. Total capital mobilization in 2019 hit VND 313.9 trillion, a 12.6 percent jump from the \nprevious year. The size of the capital market at the end of 2019 had reached 112.76 percent of \nGDP, up 10.8 percent in absolute value compared to 2018.\n\nIn the bank credit market, 2019\u2019s credit growth was 13.65 percent, with total means of payment \nand capital mobilization of credit institutions up by 14.78 and 14.82 percent, respectively \ncompared to 2018.\n\nThe foreign exchange market was stable, the exchange rate policy was operated flexibly and \nforeign reserves also increased.\n\n\fP A R T   I I   \u2013   B O N D   M A R K E T   O P E R A T I O N S   I N   2 0 1 9 \n\n2 3\n\nII. GOVERNMENT BOND, GOVERNMENT-GUARANTEED BOND AND \nMUNICIPAL BOND MARKETS\n\n1. GOVERNMENT BOND MARKET \n\nBond issuance plan: Total National Assembly-approved borrowing to finance the budget deficit \nand refinance debt principals of the central government in 2019 amounted to VND 391,471 \nbillion, of which Government bonds issued through auctions to finance the budget totalled \nVND 242,000 billion. \n\nGovernment bond issuance arrangements: In 2019, the total value of Government bonds to \nbe issued was VND 239,769 billion, an increase of 41.2 percent compared to 2018, with VND \n197,769 billion through auctions and VND 42,000 billion by private placement. \n\nThe State Treasury conducted 48 Government bond auction sessions, with the total value of \ncalls for bids amounting to VND 246,250 billion, a 15.7 percent decline from 2018. The total \nbidded amount was VND 793,970 billion, up by 22 per cent compared to 2018. The total value \nof successful bids was VND 197,769 billion, a 19.2 percent rise from 2018.\n\nTABLE 4  Ratio of bidding/calls for bids by volume (2018-2019)\n\nJanuary February March April May June July August\n\nSeptember October November December\n\nYear \n2018 4.26\n\nYear \n2019 3.48\n\n3.73\n\n2.45\n\n2.61 2.11\n\n2.18\n\n2.33 1.63\n\n1.78\n\n2.05\n\n1.78\n\n3.59\n\n2.13\n\n2.08 2.81 4.91 3.26 4.56\n\n4.41\n\n3.77\n\n2.99\n\n1.66\n\n2.43\n\nIssuing tenors: All issued bonds were in tenors of five years or more, of which bonds with tenors \nof 10 years or more accounted for 94 percent of the total bond issued volume and tenors of 20 \nyears or more (11.3 percent).\n\nThe average issuing maturity of Government \nbonds  was  13.44  percent  in  2019,  which \nlengthened  the  average  time  to  maturity \nof the Government bond portfolio to 7.42 \nyears by the end of 2019. This was 0.59 years \nlonger than the average time to maturity of \n6.83 years (2018), and 1.44 years to 5.98 years \n(2017). \n\nIssuing interest rates: The Government bond \nissuance interest rate in 2019 declined across \nthe full spectrum of maturities. By the end of \n2019, the issuing rate was 2 percent for a five-\nyear tenor, 3.48 percent for a 10-year tenor, \n3.65 percent for a 15-year tenor, 4.02 percent \nfor a 20-year tenor and 4.55 percent for a \n30-year tenor.

The \naverage issuing rate in 2019 was 4.51 percent, 0.2 less than the 4.71 percent, per year interest \nrate in 2018.\n\nIn the Government bond market, interest rates tended to decrease due to the positive impacts \nfrom the macroeconomic situation and money market interest rates, whereby investors \nincreased demand for government bonds. The ratio of bidding/calls for bids in 2019 maintained \nat two to four and each bidding session attracted from nine to 15 participants.\n\nFIGURE 9 \n\nInterest rate dynamics for all issuing tenors (2019)\n\n7.00%\n\n6.00%\n\n5.00%\n\n4.00%\n\n3.00%\n\n2.00%\n\n1.00%\n\n0.00%\n\n5yr\n\n7yr\n\n10yr\n\n15yr\n\n20yr\n\n30yr\n\nJan\n\nFeb Mar Apr May June July Aug\n\nSep Oct Nov Dec\n\nFIGURE 10  Government bonds outstanding \ndisaggregated by time to maturity of debt \nportfolio \n\n9.90%\n\n53.70%\n\n36.40%\n\nEqual or less than 1 yr\n\n1yr to 5yr\n\nAbove 5yr\n\nGovernment bond market size: By  the  end \nof  2019,  the  Government  bond  market \namounted to 26.54 percent of  GDP, driven \nby  6.1  percent  growth  in  absolute  value \ncompared to 2018.\n\nSecondary  market  listing  and  trading:  The \nvolume of Government bonds listed on the \nHNX by the end of 2019 amounted to VND \n987,814 billion by face value, with 172 listed \nbond codes. \n\nThe total value of Government bond trading \ntransactions  in  the  secondary  market \nincreased  by  3.36  percent  from  2018,  of \nwhich  the  value  of  outright  transactions \nclimbed by 14.4 percent from 2018, while \nrepo transaction values dropped by 7 percent \nfrom 2018. Repo transactions accounted for \n46 percent of the total value of Government \nbond trading transactions (6 percent decline \n\n\fP A R T   I I   \u2013   B O N D   M A R K E T   O P E R A T I O N S   I N   2 0 1 9 \n\n2 5\n\nfrom 2018). Government bond trading volumes increased in 2019 due to the downward trend \nin interest rates, which made bond prices increase and allow investors to record profits when \ntrading on the market.\n\nThe average volume of bond trading transactions in a session was VND 7,682 billion in 2019, a \n3.4 percent rise from 2018. \n\nTABLE 5  Government bond transactions values (2018-2019) (Unit: VND billion)\n\nTransaction types\n\nOutright transactions\n\nRepo transactions\n\nTotal transaction value\n\n2018\n\n899,244\n\n958,933\n\n1,858,177\n\nAverage transaction value per session\n\n7,432\n\n2019\n\n1,028,768\n\n891,824\n\n1,920,592\n\n7,682\n\nInvestor base: In 2019, the MOF focused on issuing government bonds with tenors of five \nyears or more to meet the investment needs of non-banking financial institutions, such as \nsocial insurance, deposit insurance and insurance companies. With long-term funding, non-\nbank financial institutions actively participated in bidding for Government bonds, creating a \nstable demand for tenors of 10 years or more. By the end of 2019, credit institutions held 43.87 \npercent of Government bonds outstanding (a 3.93 percent drop from the end of 2018), while \nnon-bank financial institutions (insurance companies, investment funds, Social Security Agency \nand Deposit Insurance Corporation) held 56.13 percent of Government bonds outstanding. As \nsuch, credit institution holdings of Government bonds have continuously declined, while those \nof non-bank financial institutions have climbed.\n\nGovernment bond switches: With the goal to restructure the Government bond debt portfolio \nin a sustainable manner and form large-scale Government bond codes to increase liquidity \nin the secondary market, in 2019 the MOF implemented five switch auctions of Government \nbonds to extend the remaining maturity of the Government bond portfolio, reduce pressure \non refinancing and cut the debt peak for the State budget. Accordingly, the MOF successfully \nswitched VND 2,830.5 billion in source bonds with remaining maturities of about 1.17 year with \ndestination bonds having an average maturity of 13.09 years to restructure the Government \ndebt portfolio.\n\nGovernment bond futures: On July 4, 2019, five-year Government bond future products were \nofficially traded on the HNX to offer more hedging products for investors. Clearing and \nsettlement of Government bond futures is implemented at the VSD. The average trading \nvolume of this product reached 10 contracts per session. As of December 31, 2019, VSD \nhad cleared and made settlement on five Government bond future contracts, of which two \ncontracts were expired.\n\n2. GOVERNMENT-GUARANTEED BOND MARKET \n\nIssuance plan: In 2019, the Prime Minister approved the total limit on bond issuance guarantees \nfor the two policy banks at VND 17,499 billion (VND 13,797 billion for Vietnam Development \nBank and VND 3,702 billion for Vietnam Social Policy Bank). \n\n\f2 6\n\nV I E T N A M   B O N D   M A R K E T   2 0 1 9\n\nIssuance arrangements: All Government-guaranteed bonds issued by the Vietnam Social Policy \nBank and Vietnam Development Bank were auctioned on the HNX.

The total trading volume of Government-guaranteed bonds in 2019 was VND \n336,895 billion, 4.9 percent higher than in 2018, of which the value of outright transactions was \nVND 106,933 billion \u2013 a  3.86 percent fall from 2018. The value of repo transactions was VND \n229,962 billion, 9.6 percent higher than in 2018. The average transaction value per session was \nVND 1,348 billion, a 4.92 percent rise from 2018. \n\n3.

CORPORATE BOND MARKET \n\nIn 2019, the corporate bond market had dynamically expanded compared to previous \nyears, by 31.2 percent from 2018 and equal to 10.85 percent of GDP in 2019. The size of the \nprivately-placed corporate bond market was equal to 10.14 percent of GDP, underlining the \npoint that enterprises are increasing their focus on the bond issuance channel to mobilize \ncapital in addition to bank loans.\n\n\f2 8\n\nV I E T N A M   B O N D   M A R K E T   2 0 1 9\n\nLegal framework:\n\nFrom February 1, 2019, Decree No.163/2018/ND-CP (December 4, 2018) on the issuance of \ncorporate bonds in private placement came into effect. Accordingly, the decree introduces \nnew provisions to create favorable conditions for enterprises to mobilize capital from bond \nissuances through: i) relaxing issuance conditions (that enterprises must post a profit in \nthe preceding year), ii) supplementing regulations on the issuance of bonds in tranches in \naccordance with progress in investment projects, iii) standardizing issuing documents and \niv) adding an information disclosure mechanism and forming a corporate bond-dedicated \nwebsite on the HNX to increase the profile and transparency of the corporate bond issuance \nprocess.\n\nOn November 26, 2019, the National Assembly issued the Securities Law No.54/2019/QH14, \neffective from January 1, 2021 with new regulations on the issuance and trading of corporate \nbonds issued through public offerings and private placement. Specifically:\n\nPublic offerings: i) having credit rating results for bond issuers in accordance with Government \nregulations on credit ratings and time of application, ii) linking the issuance of corporate \nbonds to the public with listing and trading on the stock market, iii) simplifying documents \nand processes to create favorable conditions for enterprises to raise capital, iv) stipulating \nthat enterprises conducting public offerings would have chartered capital contributed at the \ntime of registration of offering from VND 30 billion or more according to the value recorded \nin the accounting books (Securities Law 2006 regulated that the enterprises conducting \npublic offerings would have chartered capital of VND 10 billion).\n\nPrivate placement: i) For public companies, securities business organizations (securities \ncompanies,  fund  management  companies),  only  professional  investors  can  buy  and \ntrade bonds issued by these organizations and ii) for privately-placed corporate bonds of \nenterprises that are not public companies, provisions of the Enterprise Law and relevant laws \nshall apply.\n\nIssued volume: The total volume of corporate bonds issued in 2019 amounted to VND 332,852 \nbillion, of which private placement accounted for VND 309,352 billion and 92.9 percent of \nthe issued volume. Public offerings amounted to VND 23,500 billion and 7.1 percent of the \nissued volume. One enterprise issued on the international market with the volume of USD \n300 million.\n\nDomestic privately-placed corporate bonds: Some 38.7 percent of bonds issued were secured, \nwhile convertible bonds and bonds with warrants accounted for 0.3 and 0.2 percent, \nrespectively of the total issuance volumes.\n\nIssuing maturities: Corporate bonds were issued in a range of tenors from one to 15 years. The \naverage tenors of privately-placed corporate bonds exceeded four years, a one year increase \nfrom 2018. The volume of privately-placed bonds with tenors of 10 years or more reached \n14.4 percent of the total issued volume, a nearly three-fold rise from 2018. The average \ntenors of bonds issued to the public exceeded five years (commercial bank bonds issued \nwith tenors of seven-10 years, bonds issued by other companies with tenors of three years). \nThe increase in average terms of corporate bonds issued in 2019 shows that businesses \nmainly issued medium and long-term bonds to raise capital.\n\n\fP A R T   I I   \u2013   B O N D   M A R K E T   O P E R A T I O N S   I N   2 0 1 9 \n\n2 9\n\nInterest  rates:  The  average  coupon  of \ncorporate bond issuances was 8.91 percent/\nyear. In particular, 81.4 percent of corporate \nbonds  issued  had    coupons  below  11 \npercent/year,  16.8  percent  had  coupons \nof  11-13  percent,  1.3  percent  had  yields \nabove 13 percent/year. The highest coupon \nwas 14.5 percent/year. The average bond \ncoupon of commercial banks reached 7.04 \npercent/year, while the average coupon of \nreal estate enterprises was 10.45 percent/\nyear  and  common  coupon  was  9.5-11 \npercent/year. For bonds issued to the public, \na floating coupon is based on the average \nreference  rate  of  four  major  commercial \nbanks  (Agribank,  BIDV, Vietcombank  and \nVietinbank).\n\nFIGURE 12  Corporate bonds issued by tenors in \n2019\n\n0.99%\n\n11.04%\n\n20.62%\n\n10.10%\n\n57.25%\n\n1-2 yr\n\n2-5 yr\n\n7-10 yr\n\nSecondary  market  listing  and  trading:  24 \ncorporate bond codes were listed on the \ntwo stock exchanges HOSE (22) and HNX \n(two), total value of listed corporate bonds \namounted  to  VND  37.42  trillion,  equal \nto 5.9 percent of the outstanding amount. The total traded value in 2019 reached VND \n42,900 billion, an increase of 4.6 percent compared to 2018. The average trading volume of \ncorporate bonds listed at the stock exchanges was VND 119 billion per session. For privately-\nplaced corporate bonds, investors usually conducted transfer transactions with securities \ncompanies as distribution agents. At the same time, from March 2019 investors could obtain \ninformation on issued bonds through updates by the HNX\u2019s Bond Information Center.\n\nover 10yr\n\n5-7 yr\n\nInvestor base: By the end of 2019, domestic investors held 96.4 percent of corporate bonds \nprivately placed, while foreign investors claimed 3.6 percent. The main investors in the \nprivately-placed market were institutional investors accounting for 91.2 percent, with \nindividual investors the remainder.\n\nBy type of investors, credit institutions reduced investment in the corporate bond primary \nmarket (from 35.6 percent in 2018 to 17.4 percent of issued volume in 2019), meanwhile \nsecurities companies were active in the primary market (30.3 percent of issued volume \nin 2018 to 44.1 percent in 2019), followed by insurers (4.3 percent), investment funds (0.8 \npercent), individual investors (8.4 percent), other domestic investors (25 percent) and foreign \ninvestors (3.6 percent).

GREEN GOVERNMENT BONDS\n\nIn 2019, the MOF coordinated and consulted with line ministries (Ministry of Planning and \nInvestment, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment) and international experts to \nstudy and evaluate the feasibility of issuing green government bonds to raise capital for \npublic environmental protection projects to 2020 (from 2016) and 2021-2025.\n\nTo prepare for the pilot issuance of green government bonds, the MOF is working with these \nministries to build a green bond legal framework:\n\nSelection of green projects to utilize proceeds from the issuance of green government bonds: The \nissuance of green bonds to mobilize funds for public environmental protection projects is in \naccordance with the Law on Environmental Protection and provisions of the State Budget \nLaw and Law on Public Investment. Regarding the selection of green projects, now in the last \nyear of the five-year medium-term public investment period (2016 to 2020), the Government \nis focusing on solutions to accelerate disbursement of public investment projects. Therefore, \nin addition to examining the issuance of government bonds for new public investment \nprojects, the MOF is studying international practices for issuance of green government \nbonds for ongoing public investment projects. Along with pilot implementation, the MOF \nwill develop a legal framework to streamline the issuance of green government bonds.\n\nFormulating a process to select green projects: The MOF is coordinating with line ministries \nto elaborate an internal process to identify projects eligible to use proceeds from green \ngovernment bond issuances.\n\nManagement and use of proceeds from issuance of green government bonds: The proceeds from \nthe issuance of green government bonds can only be used for disbursement to selected \ngreen projects and have to be disclosed to bondholders before utilizing for oversight \npurposes.\n\nReporting and information disclosure regime: The MOF has been coordinating with line \nministries on disclosure of information on the use and disbursement of proceeds from \nthe issuance of green government bonds, including a list of projects using green bond \ncapital (project details to include disbursement progress, implementation schedule and \nenvironmental impact assessment report etc.).\n\n2. GREEN CORPORATE BONDS\n\nIn 2019, the MOF coordinated with international organizations to encourage enterprises \nlooking to raise capital for environmental protection projects through provision of technical \nassistance on: i) guiding the issuance of green bonds following international practice, \nii) disseminating the regulations on issuing green corporate bonds to enterprises and iii) \nseeking support for costs of issuance consultancies and third party reviews providing \nindependent opinions on the issuance framework\u2019s green credentials. The MOF has also \nengaged with foreign investment funds on the potential of buying green corporate bonds \nissued by domestic enterprises.\n\n\fPART III\nOBJECTIVES AND POLICIES FOR \nBOND MARKET DEVELOPMENT\nIN 2020\n\nI.

Accordingly,  the  State \nTreasury announced the Government bond \nissuance plan for 2020 is VND 260,000 billion. \nDuring the implementation process, based \non the central budget\u2019s capital mobilization \nneeds and status of State budget revenues \nand expenditures, the volume of government \nbonds may be adjusted and announced to \ninvestors.\n\nIssuance plan by maturities is as Table 8.\n\nMaturity\n\n5 years\n\n7 years\n\n10 years\n\n15 years\n\n20 years\n\n30 years\n\nTotal\n\nTentative volumes \n\nVND 20,000 billion\n\nVND 15,000 billion\n\nVND 90,000 billion\n\nVND 100,000 billion\n\nVND 20,000 billion\n\nVND 15,000 billion\n\nVND 260,000 billion\n\nIssuance arrangements: The State Treasury has increased the size of bonds to be newly issued \nor re-opened on tap bonds towards the benchmark size of some bonds to reach VND 10,000-\n12,000 billion to promote secondary market liquidity. \n\nThe State Treasury focuses on issuing government bonds through auctions and Government \nbond issuance tenors are adjusted to investors\u2019 demands and interest rates are set according \nto market levels. The State Treasury will issue government bonds to ensure liquidity when the \nPrimary Dealer fulfills the two-way quoting obligation.\n\nBond switching and buybacks: In 2020, the State Treasury intends to switch some bonds due in \n2020 and 2021 to promote secondary market liquidity and restructure the Government bond \nportfolio.

GOVERNMENT-GUARANTEED BOND MARKET \n\nIssuance plan: On April 8, 2020, the Government issued Resolution No.40/NQ-CP approving the \nGovernment\u2019s guarantee limit and loan limit for re-lending in 2020, in which the maximum \nguarantee limit for two policy banks equals the obligation for debt principal repayments for \nGovernment-guaranteed  bonds in 2020. Based on the Government\u2019s approval and the credit \ngrowth policy of the two policy banks, the MOF will seek Prime Ministerial approval for a \nspecific guarantee limit for the two banks to issue Government-guaranteed bonds.\n\nIssuance arrangements: In light of limits on Government-guaranteed bond issuances approved \nby the Prime Minister, the two policy banks shall arrange for issuances of Government-\nguaranteed bonds through HNX auctions to raise finance for implementation of State credit \nschemes.\n\n3. MUNICIPAL BONDS MARKET\n\nThe total sub-national government debt borrowing limit in 2020 is VND 29,482 billion (26,780 \nbillion in 2019) (VND 18,103 billion to finance sub-national budget deficits and VND 11,379 \nbillion to re-finance debt principals). In line with the approved debt borrowing limit, sub-\nnational governments shall select borrowing instruments,  including issuances of municipal \nbonds.\n\nThe amount of capital mobilized through issuing local government bonds in 2020 depends on \nfinancing needs of sub-national governments and bond market conditions. \n\nObligations on due debt principal repayments of municipal bonds in 2020 amount to VND \n8,565 billion (VND 3,315 billion by Ho Chi Minh City, VND 4,000 billion by Hanoi, VND 500 billion \nby Haiphong, VND 200 billion by Bac Ninh and VND 550 billion by Quang Ninh).\n\nII. CORPORATE BOND MARKET \n\nLegal framework: Based on provisions of the Securities Law 2019 and the amended Enterprise \nLaw (effective from January 1, 2021), in 2020 the legal framework for corporate bond issuances \nwill continue to be enhanced. \n\nThe MOF is developing two decrees on the issuance of corporate bonds for submission to the \nGovernment for promulgation: (i) one decree guiding the implementation of a number of \narticles of the Securities Law to guide the dossier and process for issuing bonds through public \nofferings and (ii) one decree to replace Decree No.163/2018/ND-CP on the issuance of corporate \nbonds through private placement. At the same time, the MOF is reviewing and strengthening \nsanctions for violations by issuers and service providers of corporate bonds issued through \npublic offerings and private placement as defined by the decree on administrative sanctions in \nthe areas of securities and the securities market in line with the Securities Law 2019.\n\n\f3 4\n\nV I E T N A M   B O N D   M A R K E T   2 0 1 9\n\nAt the same time, the MOF is coordinating with the Ministry of Planning and Investment to \nfinalize regulations on project bond issuances through the Law on Investment in the form of \npublic-private partnerships (PPP). A guiding decree effective from January 1, 2021 will also \nact as a legal basis for a special purpose vehicle to issue project bonds to raise capital for PPP \nprojects.\n\nIssuance plan: The volume of corporate bonds to be issued in 2020 is dependent on enterprises\u2019 \nfinancing needs and market conditions. Due to complications from the Covid-19 pandemic, \nthe economy will encounter challenges that could impact the demand for corporate bond \nissuances in 2020.\n\nIssuance arrangements: In 2020, Vietnam\u2019s corporate bond market will take the following \ndevelopment steps:\n\nFirst, step-by-step upgrade and effectively operate a HNX\u2019s specialized corporate bond website \nto support the needs of investors and issuing enterprises seeking information on corporate \nbond issuances. \n\nSecond, enhance infrastructure to support the registration, custody, listing and trading of \ncorporate bonds. This will facilitate enterprises and investors to participate in corporate bond \nfinancing through public offerings and private placements to elevate public disclosure and \ntransparency in bond financing. \n\nThird, actively provide systematic information on corporate bond market operations and \ncollaborate with international organizations to conduct workshops and conferences focussed \non corporate bond market development. \n\nFourth, develop and release a handbook as a guideline for bond issuances and provide trainings \nfor enterprises participating in market bond raising, led by VBMA.\n\nFifth, issue regulations to provide specific guidance on publishing information on a specialized \ncorporate bond website and the process to transfer ownership of corporate bonds (HNX-\nissued regulation on operating a bond information website on corporate bonds. VSD will issue \na regulation guiding the process and procedures to identify privately-placed corporate bond \nownership). \n\nIII. GREEN BOND MARKET\n\n1.
