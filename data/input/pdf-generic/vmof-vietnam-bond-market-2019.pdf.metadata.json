Contributing to this impressive \neconomic outcome, Vietnam\u2019s bond market continued to grow rapidly and synchronously, \naffirming its role as an effective financing channel for the government, enterprises, sub-\nnational governments and State-owned policy banks. \nThe bond market\u2019s size accounted for 40.14 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2019, \na five-fold jump from 2011, saw the bond market\u2019s total financing amount to VND 581,089 \nbillion - equivalent to 9.62 percent of GDP and an increase of 25.7 percent compared to 2018 \nas well as 4.6 times higher than in 2011, while improving liquidity in the secondary market. \nInstruments and the investor base have also become increasingly diversified. \nIn an effort to systematically inform investors about the bond market and its dynamics, the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) developed and published the landmark \u201cVietnam Annual Bond \nMarket Report in 2018\u201d. This report was highly appreciated by the investor community, \nmarket members and organizations. For 2019, with support from the World Bank, the Swiss \nState Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) and Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale \nZusammenarbeit (GIZ), the MOF has further enhanced the content, data and format in \ncompiling this \u201cVietnam Bond Market Annual Report 2019\u201d, ensuring a rich and timely source \nof information for investors on development of Vietnam\u2019s bond market.\nI hope this report will be an insightful resource and reference point for investors as well as \nothers interested and participating in Vietnam\u2019s bond market.\nMinister of Finance \nDinh Tien Dzung", "6\nLIST OF ABBREVIATIONS\nBIDV  Vietnam Bank for Investment and Development \nCPI  Consumer Price Index\nDIV   Deposit Insurance of Vietnam \nGDP  Gross Domestic Product\nHNX  Hanoi Stock Exchange\nHOSE   Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange \nICOR   Incremental Capital-Output Ratio\nMOF   Ministry of Finance \nOTC  Over-the-counter\nPPP   Public-Private Partnership\nSBV   State Bank of Vietnam \nSECO   State Secretariat for Economic Affairs\nSSC   State Securities Commission \nUSD  United States Dollar\nVBMA  Vietnam Bond Market Association \nVDB  Vietnam Development Bank\nVND  Vietnam Dong\nVSD   Vietnam Securities Depository Center \nVSPB  Vietnam Social Policy Bank\nVSS   Vietnam Social Security Agency ", "PART I\nOVERVIEW OF THE VIETNAM \nBOND MARKET\nI. CONCEPTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE BOND MARKET\nVietnam\u2019s bond market began to take shape in the mid-1990s, with the Government issuing \na series of construction and national bonds to finance the State budget. During 1990-2000, \nthe State Treasury was the only authorized issuer to raise market finance through short-tenor \nTreasury bills and bonds of less than three years.\nAlongside the economy and financial market\u2019s development, the bond market has evolved \ninto two main branches: i) Government bond, Government-guaranteed bond and municipal \nbond markets and ii) the corporate bond market. Both were established and gradually grew \nin response to financing requirements of the Government, State-owned policy banks, sub-\nnational governments and enterprises. \nFour main types of issuers operate in the bond market: i) the State Treasury is authorized by \nthe Ministry of Finance (MOF) as the issuer of Government bonds to finance State budget \ndeficits and refinance due debt principals as stipulated in the State Budget Law and Public \nDebt Management Law, ii) State-owned policy banks (Vietnam Social Policy Bank (VSPB) and \nVietnam Development Bank (VDB)) are permitted to issue bonds with Government guarantees \nto finance State policy-targeted credit schemes, iii) sub-national People\u2019s Committees \nof provinces and municipalities issue municipal bonds to fund respective sub-national \ngovernment budgets and iv) incorporated entities issue corporate bonds to service productive \nand commercial investments.\nThe investor base consists of financial intermediaries (credit institutions, securities firms, \ninsurance companies and investment funds), Vietnam Social Security Agency (VSS), Deposit \nInsurance of Vietnam (DIV), individual and other investors.\nThe Vietnam Bond Market Association (VBMA) is a socio-professional body established in \n2009, whose members are bond market investors and intermediaries - some of whom are \nalso corporate issuers. VBMA acts as a platform for information exchanges and updates, \nto strengthen collaboration among regulators, issuers and investors, provide opinions to \nregulators for enhancements to the legal framework governing the bond market, deliver \nsupport services to its members, deliver training and capacity building for its members and \nengage in cooperation with global and regional bond market associations.\nThe Vietnam Securities Depository Center (VSD), Hanoi Stock Exchange (HNX) and Ho Chi \nMinh Stock Exchange (HOSE) are service providers for bond registration, custody, listing and \ntrading for issuers. Accordingly, HNX and VSD organize and operate platforms for government, \ngovernment-guaranteed and municipal bond primary issuance, registration, custody listing \nand trading in the secondary market as well as making interest and principal payments on debt ", "8 VIETNAM BOND MARKET 2019\ninstruments and clearing debt instrument transactions. Corporate bonds can be registered and \ndeposited at the VSD and listed and traded on the HNX and HOSE.\nBond market products have increasingly diversified in response to investors\u2019 demands and \nthe increasing debt-carrying capacity of issuers. As for Government bonds, a full range of \ntenors were observed, ranging from T-bills of less than 364 days to bonds with 30-year tenors, \nGovernment-guaranteed bonds have fixed-rate tenors from two to 15 years and municipal \nbonds from three to 30 years. The corporate bond market boasts a full range of products \nencompassing fixed to variable rates, secured and guaranteed bonds. \nIntermediary institutions in the capital and bond markets have emerged and developed with \nparticipation of securities firms, fund management companies, investment funds pension \nfunds and credit rating agencies.\nThe institutional and policy framework has been steadily reformed with increasingly diversified \nproducts and steadfast growth in intermediary institutions and market infrastructure. During \n2011-2019, the bond market developed in depth and breadth with an annual average growth \nrate of 24 percent. The Government bond market\u2019s 31 percent average annual growth was a \nparticularly eye-catching feature, with the corporate bond market posting an average annual \ngrowth rate of 26 percent. \nThe bond market\u2019s size expanded from just 2.82 percent of GDP in 2001 to 17.36 percent in \n2011 and upward to 40.14 percent in 2019. By the end of 2019, the Government bond market\u2019s \nsize equalled 26.54 percent of GDP, followed by corporate bonds (10.85 percent), Government-\nguaranteed bonds (2.43 percent) and municipal bonds (0.32 percent).\nFIGURE 1  Bond market sizes relative to GDP \n45.00%\n39.55% 40.14%\n40.00% 37.69%\n37.00%\n35.00%\n24.13%\n30.00% 27.33% 27.59% 27.25%\n26.54%\n25.00% 21.27%\n19.08% 16.19%\n20.00% 16.59%\n17.60%\n13.84%\n15.00% 11.26%\n9.52% 9.01%\n10.00% 8.16% 6.29% 10.85%\n5.36%\n5.00% 53..4755%% 41..8956%% 42..6733%% 42..3503%% 33..8450%% 3.68% 3.31% 2.85% 2.43%\n0.00%\n0.24% 0.26% 0.46% 0.60% 0.69% 0.63% 0.50% 0.44% 0.32%\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\nWhole market Government bond Government guaranteed bond\nCorporate bond Municipal bond", "PART I \u2013 OVERVIEW OF THE VIETNAM BOND MARKET 9\n1. GOVERNMENT BONDS, GOVERNMENT-GUARANTEED BONDS AND MUNICIPAL BONDS \nGovernment bonds (Government debt instruments): Can be issued by the State Treasury \nvia three methods: i) auctioning on securities exchanges, ii) underwriting and iii) private \nplacement. Upon the specialized Government bond market\u2019s establishment in 2009, the \nauctioning and listing of tradable Government bonds have taken place on the HNX, with \nregistration, custody, interest and principal payments and clearing services performed by \nVSD. Currently, most Government bonds are issued through auctions, listed and traded \non the Government bond market-specialized HNX. Primary Dealers: According to a new \nregulation in Decree No.95/2018/ND-CP, from 2019 a system of primary dealers was \nestablished (previously referred to as \u201cGovernment bond auctioning members\u201d), consisting \nof commercial banks and securities firms satisfying eligibility conditions and selected from \nannual short-lists issued by the MOF, as exclusive participants in Government bond auctions \non behalf of themselves or for their customers. \nCurrently, key Government bond investors consist of commercial banks, VSS, DIV and \ninsurance companies. In recent years, Government bond holdings amongst commercial \nbanks have declined considerably, while those of non-bank financial institutions (VSS, DIV, \ninsurance companies, investment funds) are trending up, which demonstrates the improving \ndiversity of the investor base within the Government bond market.\nGovernment-guaranteed bonds: Are issued via auctions on the HNX, registered and deposited \nat the VSD, listed and traded on the HNX - as are Government bonds. Currently, the Vietnam \nDevelopment Bank and Vietnam Social Policy Bank are the two organizations issuing \ngovernment-guarantee bonds on the HNX.\nSimilar to Government bond auctions, Primary Dealers are exclusive members permitted to \nparticipate in Government-guaranteed bond auctions on behalf of themselves or customers. \nOther dealers and investors can purchase Government-guaranteed bonds from or via \nPrimary Dealers. Government-guaranteed bond investors are primarily commercial banks, \ninsurers and securities firms.\nMunicipal bonds: Can be issued through one of two methods: (i) auctioned via the securities \nexchanges and (ii) underwriting. After issuance on the primary market, bonds are registered \nand put into VSD custody, listed and traded in securities exchanges and when requested by \nthe issuer. Most municipal bond investors are commercial banks.\n2. CORPORATE BONDS  \nThe corporate bond market can be viewed as two components: i) private placement and ii) \npublic offerings. \nFor public offerings of bonds,  the State Securities Commission (SSC) issues registration \ncertificates for offerings of bonds and/or provides opinions on plans for offerings of privately-\nplaced convertible bonds, privately-placed bonds with warrants of public companies, directly \nmonitors public offerings and private placements of bonds in public companies. \nFor privately-placed bonds, the enterprise is not required to be licensed by regulators and \nonly needs to comply with regulations on conditions, issuance process and full disclosure of \ninformation as prescribed by law. Regarding international market bond issuances, issuing \ncompanies must register with the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) for compliance with external ", "10 VIETNAM BOND MARKET 2019\ncommercial borrowing limits and issuing bonds in accordance with regulations of the issuing \nmarket.\nBond-issuing enterprises, under the principles of self-borrowing, self-repayment and \nresponsibilities to debt-carrying capacity and solvency through compliance with eligibility \nconditions, must fully disclose information as stipulated by regulations. Enterprises can issue \nbonds through: i) auctioning, ii) underwriting and iii) direct placement with investors. At each \nstage, corporate bond regulations are subject to change, yet their cross-cutting objectives are \nprotection of investor interests, transparency, corporate bond market openness and facilitation \nof company financing. \nInvestors must self-assess the risks of investing in bonds, restrictions on trading bonds invested \nand take responsibility for their investment decisions. The corporate bond market investor base \nconsists of commercial banks as well as insurance companies, securities investment funds, \nindividuals and other organizations. The share of commercial bank holdings of corporate \nbonds has declined in recent years, a sign of growing interest from other (domestic and \nexternal) investors in local corporate bonds, including individual investors. Corporate bonds are \ninvestment products suitable for professional investors who have financial capacity, investment \nexperience and an ability to analyze and take risks. As for individual investors, they are advised \nto only buy corporate bonds when they have the requisite financial knowledge, investment \nexperience, ability to analyze and take risks.\nIntermediary and service institutions that assist the development of the corporate bond market \nare established and developing, including credit ratings agencies, advisory service providers, \ndepository agencies, underwriters for bond issuances as well as bond settlement and private \nplaced corporate bond information center1.\nII. GOVERNMENT BOND, GOVERNMENT-GUARANTEED BOND AND \nMUNICIPAL BOND MARKETS\n1. GOVERNMENT BOND MARKET \nUnder the Public Debt Management Law,  Government debt instruments - which include \nTreasury bonds, Treasury bills and national construction bonds - are issued regularly to finance \nthe State budget.\nThe Government bond market plays a pivotal role in development of the overall bond market, \ndue to solid foundations anchored in its legal framework, primary and secondary markets, \ninfrastructure and investor base. The Government is the overarching and most frequent issuer \nin the bond market, with an annual average Government bond issuing value of VND 203,712 \nbillion during 2011-2018.\n1.1 Legal framework\nFrom July 1, 2018, Government bond issuances and transactions are governed by the Public \nDebt Management Law 2017, Decree No.95/2018/ND-CP (June 30, 2018), promulgating \nregulations on the issuance, registration, custody, listing and trading of Government debt \n1  The corporate bond information center is based at the HNX.", "PART I \u2013 OVERVIEW OF THE VIETNAM BOND MARKET 11\ninstruments in securities markets and other guideline circulars (please refer to Annex 1: the list of \nlegal and regulatory documents governing the issuance and transactions of Government bonds).\n1.2. Market  features\nIssuance plan: The annual Government bond issued volume is determined by the State budget \nplan enacted by the National Assembly and cognizance of bond market conditions. In view of \nthe State budget financing mandate, the MOF decides Government bond issued volumes and \nmandates the State Treasury to prepare and disclose the annual bond issuance and tentative \nquarterly bond issuance plans on the websites of the Vietnam State Treasury (http://vst.mof.gov.\nvn) and HNX (https://hnx.vn/en-gb/trai-phieu.html). \nAuctions calendar: At the beginning of each year, the State Treasury notifies Primary Dealers \nof the annual auctions calendar broken down by weeks to allow the latter to actively plan \nengagement in Government bond auctions performed each Wednesday morning (excluding \npublic holidays and festivals as stipulated by legislation). \nIssuing methods: In alignment with regulations, Government bonds can be issued through \nauctions, underwriting and private placements. The former is the most common method, while \nunderwriting is used to launch new products on the market.\nIssuance auctions: Are conducted on the trading system of HNX. Multiple-price or uniform-price \nauctions can be applied. The latter is more common, with the uniform cut-off rate determined \nas the auction result for all successful bidders. \nCognizant of members\u2019 financing needs and bids, the State Treasury immediately after each \nmorning auction can announce an additional afternoon session on the same day if within \napproved limits. In additional auction sessions, the fresh issued volume can be up to 50 \npercent of the original offered volume for each bond code, depending on State Treasury cash \nmanagement and investor demand.\nUnderwriting method of bond issuances: Is conducted via a lead underwriter and/or \nco-underwriter(s) that can solicit potential investors and act on behalf of an underwriting \nsyndicate to sign the underwriting contract and distribute bonds to members as per \ninternational practice (please refer to issuing procedures in Annex 3 and Annex 4).\nPrimary Dealers\u2019 roles, rights and obligations: Primary Dealers are organizations selected by the \nMOF to exercise the rights and obligations to issue and trade government debt instruments \nin the domestic market under provisions of Decree No.95/2018/ND-CP and MOF guidance to \ncreate liquidity in the primary and secondary markets for Government bonds.\nAs for the rights, in addition to being exclusive participants in Government bond auctions, \nPrimary Dealers are also prioritized to act as lead underwriters in auctions and in buybacks and \nswitching of Government bonds as well as engage with State regulators on market regulations. \nIn fulfilment of obligations to quote firmly committed prices whilst having insufficient \nGovernment bonds for a trade, Primary Dealers can request the State Treasury issue benchmark \nbonds to support market liquidity. \nAs for the obligations, Primary Dealers are obliged to quote firmly committed bid-ask prices \nfor benchmark bonds in the secondary market to create market liquidity as well as purchase \nand trade Government bonds in minimum volumes specified for each period by the MOF. \nSuch quotations are stipulated by Decree No.95/2018/ND-CP, MOF guidelines and State ", "12 VIETNAM BOND MARKET 2019\nTreasury announcements of benchmark bonds, start and end dates for firmly committed price \nquotations, frequency and volumes of firmly committed price quotations for each benchmark \nbond and the maximum spread for calculations of firmly committed bid-ask prices.2 Annually, \nthe MOF evaluates the performance of obligations to rank and publish the list of Primary \nDealers.\nConditions and procedures for registration of Primary Dealers: Commercial banks and securities \ncompanies that meet conditions for purchasing Government debt instruments in the primary \nmarket and trading on the secondary market with minimum amounts prescribed by the MOF \nin each period, have contributed sufficient charter capital, have operated for three years or \nmore and aspire to be a Primary Dealer should send a dossier to the MOF within the period of \nNovember 1-10 each year. The MOF assesses the satisfaction of conditions specified in Decree \nNo.95/2018/ND-CP and publishes the list of Primary Dealers before December 31 every year.\nInstruments: Government bond market products include Treasury bills with tenors of up to 364 \ndays, Government bonds with tenors of two, three, five, seven, 10, 15, 20 and 30 years (20- and \n30-year tenors were first issued in 2015). Fixed-rate bonds can have short or long first coupons. \nIn addition to fixed-rate Government bond products, zero-coupon bonds have been issued. \nIn view of Government bond portfolio restructuring and investor base diversification policies, \nissued volumes of Government bonds with longer tenors of at least five years or more account \nfor an increasing share of annual issued volumes.\nSettlement, registration and custody processes: Government bond auctions are settled via the \nSBV\u2019s Banking Operations Center. The auction date is T, the settlement date of Government \nbond purchases via auctions is the day after the auction (T+1), and Government bonds are \nlisted and traded on the HNX on the day after (T+2) the settlement date. Government bonds \nare registered and deposited with the VSD, while secondary market purchases are settled via \nthe SBV\u2019s Banking Operations Center on the day after the trade date (T+1).\nSecondary market transactions: The four types of Government bond transactions are: i) outright, \nii) repo, iii) sale and repurchase repo and iv) lending and borrowing transactions, with the first \nand third most common. Government bonds are traded via electronic and common put-\nthrough methods, with the latter seeing investors negotiate transaction conditions and enter \nthe result into HNX\u2019s Government bond trading platform for transaction establishment. \nBond buybacks and switching: Government bonds can be bought back and switched as \narranged by the State Treasury under initiatives approved by the Prime Minister through \nnegotiations or auctions. Specific procedures for Government bond buybacks or switching are \nspecified in MOF guideline circulars.  \n1.3. Market overview (2011-2018)\nGovernment bond market operations, driven by legal framework refinement, have witnessed \nfundamental reforms to instrument types, processes and procedures for bond issuances, \nregistration, custody, listing, trading and the investor base. During 2011-2018, total issued \nvolumes of Government bonds amounted to VND 1,972 trillion (or VND 220 trillion per year on \naverage) accounting for 60-70 percent of annual State budget financing volumes.  \n2  Primary Dealer market making and Vietnam State Treasury liquidity support are in the pre-implementation \nphase.", "PART I \u2013 OVERVIEW OF THE VIETNAM BOND MARKET 13\nInstruments: Prior to 2014, Government bonds were mainly issued in short- to medium-term \ntenors of less than 10 years. Subsequently, longer-term bonds were prioritized to lengthen \nthe average term to maturity of the Government bond portfolio, starting with issuances of 20- \nand 30-year tenors in 2015. Following National Assembly Resolution No.25/2016/NQ-QH on \napproval of the five-year national financial plan for 2016-2020, Government bonds have been \nissued with tenors of five years or more, while Treasury bills have not been issued since 2017. \nAs a result, the average issuing maturity of Government bonds has lengthened to increase \nportfolio debt sustainability. In addition, several Government bond sizes have grown to VND \n10,000 billion and can be re-opened on tap during three to four-month periods depending on \nmarket conditions. Bond sizes are forecast to further expand to establish benchmark bonds \nsuitable for market development. \nFIGURE 2  Proportion of Government bonds issued by tenors (2011-2018)\n60,00%\n50,00% Under 1yr\n2yr\n40,00% 3yr\n5yr\n30,00%\n7yr\n10yr\n20,00%\n15yr\n20yr\n10,00%\n30yr\n0,00%\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\nIssuing methods: Government bonds during  FIGURE 3  Government bond issuing volumes and \n2011-2018 were mainly issued by HNX  outstanding (2011-2018)\nauctions.

Since 2011, the \nGovernment-guaranteed bond market has operated smoothly with an average annual issued \nvolume of VND 38 trillion.    \n2.1. Legal framework\nDuring 2011-2017, Government-guaranteed bond issuances complied with the 2009 \nPublic Debt Management Law, Decree No.01/2011/ND-CP on issuances of Government, \nGovernment-guaranteed and municipal bonds as well as applicable MOF circulars. Since \nJuly 1, 2018  issuances of Government-guaranteed bonds were governed by the 2017 \nPublic Debt Management Law, Decree No.91/2018/ND-CP (June 26, 2018) on issuance \nand management of Government guarantees.

As stipulated \nin the 2017 Public Debt Management Law and 2015 State Budget Law, People\u2019s Committees \nof provinces and cities are permitted to issue municipal bonds to finance respective budget \ndeficits and/or refinance sub-national government debt principals. The bond issued volume \nmust be within the annual sub-national government debt limit approved by the National \nAssembly. Issuing municipal bonds is one of the means to raise capital for local governments \nunder provisions of the State Budget Law and Law on Public Debt Management. \n3.2. Municipal bond market overview (2011-2018)   \nThe total issued volume of municipal bonds in the primary market amounted to VND 35,384 \nbillion during this period, equivalent to an annual average of VND 5,054 billion, partially \nresponsive to financing needs of sub-national governments.

The municipal bond issuance plan \nis published on the website of HNX where the auction will take place, website(s) of the sub-\nnational government or issuing agent as authorized by the sub-national government. \nInstruments: In the municipal bond market, products range from three- to 30-year tenors \nwith fixed rate (three-, five-, seven-, 10-, 15-, 20- and 30-years). The majority of sub-national \ngovernments issue bonds with five-year tenors, accounting for 50 percent of total issued \nvolumes. Only Ho Chi Minh City has successfully issued bonds with 10- to 30-year tenors, \naccounting for 21.1 percent of total issued volumes. \nIssuing method(s): Most sub-national governments issue municipal bonds through the \nunderwriting method. Only Ba Ria-Vung Tau, Danang and Hanoi have issued bonds through \nHNX auctions. \nTABLE 3  Transaction volumes of municipal bonds (2011-2018) (Unit: VND billion)\n  2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\nOutright transactions - - 2,434.13 15,968 2,902.64 1,284 3,018 551\nRepo transactions - - - 1,455 2,614.60 336 752 33.54\nTotal transaction value - - 2,434.13 17,423 5,517.24 1,620 3,770 585\nAverage transaction \nvalue per session - - 9.74 70.54 22.25 6.45 15.08 2.34\nTransaction and settlement: Municipal bonds are traded and settled in the secondary \nmarket as per Government bonds.

Issuance of green municipal bonds\nIn Decree No.93/2018/ND-CP (June 30, 2018) stipulating debt management of local \ngovernments, Article 8 states the issuance of green bonds must comply with the same \nregulations for ordinary municipal bonds and provincial People\u2019s Committees must \nreport lists of projects using green municipal bond issuance capital under MOF guidance. \nAccordingly, the issuance of green municipal bonds must comply with a scheme approved \nby the Prime Minister and guided by the MOF.\n1.3. Issuance of green corporate bonds\nDecree No.163/2018/ND-CP (December 4, 2018) stipulating the issuance of corporate \nbonds that regulates the issuance of green corporate bonds includes the principle of \nissuance and use of proceeds, information disclosure. The issuance, registration, deposit, \nlisting and transactions of green corporate bonds are similar to those of ordinary corporate \nbonds.\n2. IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS\nIn 2016, Ho Chi Minh City issued VND 3,000 billion in 15-year municipal bonds to raise \ncapital for projects as part of respective budget expenditure mandates, including 11 \nenvironmental protection projects. Also in 2016, Ba Ria-Vung Tau province issued VND \n500 billion in five-year bonds to raise capital for projects under local budget spending, \nincluding one environmental protection project.\nPrior to 2018, however, the Government and enterprises have not implemented the \nissuance of green bonds. In order to develop and implement new regulations on the \nissuance of green bonds (green government bonds, green local government bonds, green \ncorporate bonds), the MOF has actively participated in forums on developing the green \nbond market regionally and globally. Moreover, the MOF engaged with market participants \nand enterprises on the need to invest and issue green bonds as well as achieve the ASEAN \nGreen Bond Standard and ICMA Green Bond Principles as the basis for issuance.
