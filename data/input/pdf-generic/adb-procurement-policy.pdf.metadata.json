The rights and obligations of the borrower and the providers \nof goods, works, and services for the project are governed by the \nbidding documents, and by the contracts signed by the borrower with \nthe providers of goods, works, and services and not by this policy or the \nfinancing agreements. No party other than the parties to the financing \nagreement shall derive any rights therefrom or have any claim to the \nproceeds of the financing.\n\nGeneral considerations \n\nThis policy is derived from the Articles of Agreement of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank Article 14, Operating Principle (xi), that ADB shall \ntake the necessary measures to ensure that the proceeds of any loan \nmade, guaranteed, or participated in by ADB are used only for the \npurposes for which the loan was granted, and with due attention to \nconsiderations of economy and efficiency.\n\nThe responsibility for the implementation of the project, and therefore \nfor the procurement, award, and administration of contracts under the \nproject, rests with the borrower. ADB, for its part, has the obligation to \nensure that the proceeds of its financing are used with due attention to \nconsiderations of the core procurement principles mentioned herein.\n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\nThe term \u201cproject\u201d shall include technical assistance.\nThe term \u201cborrower\u201d as used in this policy includes recipients of ADB-financed grants and ADB-\nadministered funds, and also refers to the executing agency for the ADB-financed project, in each \ncase in the context of ADB\u2019s sovereign operations. Unless specifically stated, a borrower does not \ninclude a borrower under ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations. In some cases, the borrower acts only as \nan intermediary and the project is carried out by another agency or entity, in which case references \nto the borrower include such agencies and entities, as well as sub-borrowers under onlending \narrangements.\nThe term \u201cservices\u201d shall include both nonconsulting and consulting services unless otherwise \nindicated.\n\n\f2\n\nADB Procurement Policy\n\niii. \n\ncore Procurement Principles\n\n5. \n\nThe specific procurement rules and procedures to be applied in \nimplementation of a project depend on the circumstances of the \nparticular case, but the following six core procurement principles  \n(\u201cCore Procurement Principles\u201d) guide ADB requirements: \n\n(i)  economy. The principle of economy means taking into account \nfactors such as price, quality, and any nonprice attributes,  \nas appropriate, without adversely affecting the viability of the project.\n\n(ii)  efficiency. The principle of efficiency ensures that procurement \nprocesses are proportional to the value and risks of the required \noutcome and underlying project activities, taking into account \nimplementation capacity, time constraints, and cost-effectiveness. \n\n(iii)  Fairness. The principle of fairness means (a) equal opportunity for \nand treatment of eligible bidders; (b) equitable distribution of rights \nand obligations between borrowers and bidders; and (c) credible \nmechanisms for addressing procurement-related complaints and \nproviding recourse. ADB encourages open competition as the \npreferred procurement approach, whenever possible, to maximize \nfairness of the opportunity to bid. \n\n(iv)  transparency. The principle of transparency means ensuring, \n\nthrough appropriate documentation and review of activities in the \nprocurement process, that (a) relevant procurement information \nis made publicly available to interested parties, in a consistent and \ntimely manner, through readily accessible and widely available \nsources at no (or reasonable) cost; (b) appropriate reporting of \nprocurement activity; and (c) use of confidentiality provisions in \ncontracts only where justified.\n\n(v)  Quality. This principle requires that the procurement \n\narrangements4 are structured to procure inputs and deliver outputs \nof appropriate standard in a timely and effective manner to achieve \nthe project outcomes and development objectives, taking into \naccount the context, risk, value, and complexity of procurement. \n\n(vi)  Value for money. This principle enables the borrower to obtain \noptimal benefits through effective, efficient, and economic use \nof resources by applying, as appropriate, the Core Procurement \n\n4 \n\nProcurement arrangements include procurement modalities and, as the context permits, the nature \nand extent of borrower responsibility and ADB oversight.\n\n\fADB Procurement Policy\n\n3\n\nPrinciples and related considerations, which may include life-\ncycle costs and socioeconomic and environmental development \nobjectives of the borrower. Price alone may not sufficiently \nrepresent value for money. \n\niV. \n\nFitness for Purpose\n\n6. \n\nV. \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\nFitness for purpose requires procurement arrangements to \nappropriately reflect the strategic needs and circumstances of the \nsituation. In case a standardized approach cannot effectively and \nefficiently meet project outcomes and development objectives, \nincluding in capacity-constrained environments, a customized \napproach may be adopted, entailing transaction-specific methods  \nand documentation. \n\neligibility\n\nExcept in any case in which the Board of Directors determines \notherwise, (i) loans or grants from Special Funds resources can be used \nonly for procurement of goods, works, and services produced in,  \nand supplied from, developed member countries that have contributed \nto such resources or developing member countries; and (ii) loans or \ngrants from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources or ADB-administered \nfunds can be used only for procurement of goods, works, and services \nproduced in, and supplied from, member countries. \n\nADB permits bidders from all eligible countries to offer goods, works, \nand services for ADB-financed projects. For a contract to be financed in \nwhole or in part by ADB, any participation conditions shall be limited to \nthose that are essential to ensure the bidder\u2019s capability and resources \nto successfully perform the contract in question. \n\nVi.  Development of Domestic industry \n\n9. \n\nADB encourages the development of domestic contracting, consulting, \nand manufacturing industries in the country of the borrower.\n\n\f4\n\nADB Procurement Policy\n\nVii. \n\nintegrity\n\n10.   \n\n11. \n\n12. \n\nX. \n\n13. \n\n14. \n\nADB requires application of the highest standard of ethics during any \nprocurement process subject to this Policy and use of funds, resources, \nassets, and authority in accordance with ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \nand Integrity Principles and Guidelines (both as amended from time to \ntime) (Anticorruption Guidelines).\n\nViii.  conflict of interest \n\nADB considers a conflict of interest to refer to situations in which \na party has interests that could improperly influence that party\u2019s \nperformance of official duties or responsibilities, contractual \nobligations, or compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  \nA conflict of interest may not, in all cases, in and of itself, constitute  \na violation of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Guidelines, if appropriately \naddressed or mitigated.\n\niX.  Accountability\n\nThe concept of accountability, as it applies to ADB and borrowers, \ncombines the requirements of transparency and responsibility,  \nholding those involved in the procurement process accountable  \nfor their actions (or inactions).\n\nnoncompliance\n\nIf the borrower or other parties involved in the procurement process  \ndo not comply with the applicable procurement requirements,  \nADB may, in addition to the contractual remedies set out in the relevant \nfinancing agreement, take appropriate actions consistent with ADB\u2019s \nimplementation support and monitoring and fiduciary role. \n\nXi. \n\ncomplaints\n\nProcurement-related complaints may be brought to the attention of the \nborrower or ADB, or both, at the appropriate stage of the procurement \nprocess. They must be addressed objectively and in a timely manner, \nwith transparency and fairness.\n\n\fADB Procurement Policy\n\n5\n\n15. \n\n16. \n\n17. \n\n18. \n\n19. \n\nXii.  Alternative Procurement Arrangements\n\nADB may agree to (i) apply the procurement rules and procedures of \nanother multilateral or bilateral agency or organization involved in the \nproject, and may agree to such a party taking a leading role in providing \nimplementation support and monitoring project procurement activities; \nor (ii) rely on the procurement rules and procedures applied by an agency \nor entity of the borrower accredited by ADB, provided that in each case \nsuch arrangements are (a) compatible with the value, risk, or complexity \nof the procurement; (b) consistent with the Core Procurement \nPrinciples; and that (c) unless waived, ADB\u2019s member country eligibility \nrestrictions continue to apply; and (d) ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Guidelines \nand contractual remedies in applicable financing agreements with the \nborrower continue to apply.\n\nFor cases where ADB relies on procurement risk assessments carried \nout by another development partner, ADB shall be satisfied with \nthe quality of such assessments, and associated fiduciary risks and \nmitigation measures that have been established.\n\nXiii.  e-procurement\n\nTo facilitate transparency and efficiency in the procurement \nprocess, ADB encourages borrowers to continually modernize their \nprocurement systems, including procurement through electronic means \n(e-procurement). \u00a0\n\nXiV.  Procurement Plan\n\nThe procurement plan describes how the project procurement activities \nsupport the development objectives of the project and deliver value for \nmoney under a risk-managed approach. The scope and details of the \nprocurement plan take into account, and are proportional to, the relevant \nmarket, scale, risk, value, and country circumstances, including, when \napplicable, situations of urgent need of assistance or capacity constraints, \nand the specific economic, environmental, and social objectives of  \nthe project.\n\nThe procurement plan sets forth (i) the particular contracts for the \ngoods, works, and/or services required in carrying out the project;  \n(ii) the proposed methods for procurement of contracts that are \npermitted under the financing agreement; (iii) the types of bidding \n\n\f6\n\nADB Procurement Policy\n\n20. \n\ndocuments to be used; and (iv) the related ADB review procedures and \nproposed contract supervision arrangements.\n\nThe borrower prepares and furnishes the procurement plan to ADB as \npart of project preparation, and this is to be confirmed by ADB before \nloan negotiations. The borrower updates the procurement plan annually \nor as needed throughout the duration of the project. Any changes or \nmodifications to a procurement plan by a borrower are subject to ADB \nconcurrence. ADB publicly discloses the initial procurement plans (and \nany subsequent updates), indicating the general scope and value of \nprocurement for the coming year.\n\nXV.  Procurement for nonsovereign operations\n\n21. \n\nIn the case of procurement contracts to be financed by ADB under its \nnonsovereign operations from the proceeds of (i) an ADB loan,  \n(ii) a loan guaranteed by ADB, or (iii) a grant to a private sector \nrecipient, procurement shall be carried out following established  \nprivate sector or commercial practices acceptable to ADB.\n\n\fAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its \ndeveloping member countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their \npeople. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to a large share of the \nworld\u2019s poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic \ngrowth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region.
