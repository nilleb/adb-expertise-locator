This has \nspecial implications for Asia which, despite being the new engine of growth to \nthe world economy, continues to be challenged by the persistent gap between \ndevelopments in its financial and real sectors. This paper examines how Asia\u2019s \nfinancial and economic landscapes have improved under the wave of regional \nmacroeconomic and financial management reform, yet continue to be beset by \nhighly bank-dominated local financial systems, financial infrastructures anemic in \nproper legal and regulatory frameworks, and shallow regional financial markets. \nThe situation compromises Asia\u2019s ability to respond to the financial needs of \nits vast small and medium enterprise sector, infrastructure deficits, and poor \nhouseholds, constraining prospects for sustained high growth, development, and \npoverty reduction.  The paper concludes that the financial development policy \nagenda in developing Asia should be focused on: (i) supporting economic growth \nand development, (ii) promoting financial inclusion, (iii) balancing regulation \nand innovation, and (iv) strengthening crisis prevention and management \nmechanisms.\n\n\f\fI.  Introduction\n\nSurviving the Lehman collapse in September 2008 and the postcrisis recession, the \nglobal economy struggles to regain strength. In response to the crisis, the G-20 leaders \nmade firm commitments to \u201cbuild a stronger, more globally consistent, supervisory and \nregulatory framework for the future financial sector, which will support sustainable global \ngrowth\u201d (Group of Twenty 2009a, 3). Yet, the G-20 reforms have thus far focused more on \nstrengthening the global regulatory system and restoring financial stability rather than on \nfinancial sector development, paying limited attention to the role of finance in supporting \nsustainable global growth. \n\nDespite the often devastating effects of the crisis, finance remains central to economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction.1 Theoretically, a well-functioning financial system has an \nimportant role to play in promoting economic growth and reducing poverty. Levine (2005) \nidentified the functions of the financial sector under five broad categories, namely  \n(i) producing information about potential investment opportunities; (ii) mobilizing \nsavings to the most productive investment; (iii) monitoring firms and exerting corporate \ngovernance; (iv) promoting risk diversification and sharing across individuals, firms, and \ncountries; and (v) facilitating the exchange of goods and services. Development of the \nfinancial sector reduces the cost of information collection, contract enforcement, and \ntransaction, thereby increasing allocative efficiency and promoting economic growth. \n\nAlthough not without contention, a large empirical literature has established a positive \nrelationship between financial sector development and economic growth.2 Past studies \ndemonstrated that financial sector development influences real economic activity by \naltering saving and investment decisions, capital accumulation, technological innovation, \nand hence income growth. Essentially, the financial sector pools and mobilizes savings \nto the most productive investment. Development of the financial sector can also ease \nconstraints on credit to improve the efficiency of resource allocation, hence promoting \nproductivity growth. Here, the quality as well as the quantity of investment is also an \nimportant factor for determining the productive capacity of an economy. An important \nfunction of financial services is therefore to produce information about potential \ninvestment. \n\n1  Zhuang et al. (2009) review the theoretical and empirical literature on the role of financial sector development in \n\npromoting economic growth and hence achieving poverty reduction.\n\n2  See Levine (2005) for a literature survey.\n\n\f2 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 285\n\nThe role of finance in achieving strong, sustainable, and balanced global growth seems \ncrucial more than ever as persistent weakness in advanced economies threatens the \npostcrisis global economic and financial stability. Risks remain large with increased \nbudget deficits, sovereign debt burdens, and incomplete household and banking \nsector restructuring in Europe and the United States (US). With the expectation \nof prolonged weakness in advanced economies, it is essential that emerging and \ndeveloping economies in Asia strengthen their own domestic demand for the sources \nof growth. G20 members with sustained, significant external surpluses also pledged \nto strengthen domestic sources of growth, including (depending on circumstances) \nincreasing investment and/or consumption, reducing financial market distortions, boosting \nproductivity in service sectors, improving social safety nets, and lifting constraints on \ndemand growth.\n\nIn Asia, the crisis effects differed across borders depending on the degree of economic \nand financial openness, as well as on dependency on external demand and credit. \nAlthough most Asian financial systems exhibited remarkable resilience to the crisis, \ninevitable changes in the postcrisis global economic and financial landscape require a \nrevisit to the reform of national financial sectors. \n\nAcross Asia, financial sector development remains an important development agenda. \nIn fact, in the wake of the global financial crisis and the consensus to support more \nbalanced and sustainable global growth, further domestic and regional financial \ndevelopment in Asia is now imperative. Experience and research demonstrate that \nan appropriately designed institutional framework for finance is crucial to achieve the \ntwin objectives of supporting economic growth and financial stability. First, effective \nregulation and supervision is the basic foundation for financial sector development and \nsophistication. Second, a reliable institutional framework is essential to provide the \nrules of the game for financial transactions and to support financial sector development. \nWithout an appropriate legal and institutional framework, effective finance will not develop. \nThird, previous episodes of financial crises, including the Asian financial crisis and the \nglobal financial crisis, underscore the importance of ensuring financial stability yet being \nprepared for times of financial distress and crisis. In times of financial distress or crisis, \nan effective resolution framework supports prompt responses to troubled institutions and \nhelps contain the spread of financial troubles and minimize the impact of the crisis. \n\nThis paper will examine key development agenda of the Asian financial systems in the \nface of rapidly changing global financial landscape to shed light on challenges facing \nthe region\u2019s policy makers. Section II explains salient features of the region\u2019s financial \nsector developments. Section III discusses challenges of financial sector development \nfor balanced and inclusive growth in Asia. Section IV examines approaches to financial \nsector development for diversity and stability. Section V concludes with some policy \nimplications. \n\n\fAsian Financial System: Development and Challenges | 3\n\nII.  Financial Sector Developments in Asia\n\nDeveloping Asia has emerged as a new growth pole of the world economy. With its robust \ngrowth, developing Asia has provided another \u201cengine of growth\u201d to the world economy \nwhen the traditional markets faltered. The region\u2019s economic rise in the past few decades \nhas been spectacular. Rapid growth in the region has been bolstered by policies to \npromote export-oriented industrialization while mobilizing a high level of savings. As the \nworld\u2019s fastest-growing region, developing Asia has not only outperformed industrialized \neconomies, but also other parts of the developing world. During 1980\u20132010, developing \nAsia\u2019s real gross domestic product (GDP) grew 7.3% annually on average, compared \nto the world average of 2.9%. The region\u2019s real GDP in purchasing power parity (PPP) \nterms climbed from about $2.2 trillion in 1980 to $18.5 trillion in 2010. That is an increase \nof more than eight times, compared with about three times for the world economy during \nthe same period. By 2010, the region accounted for 32.3% of world GDP; including \nJapan, the share reached 42.1%.\n\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s economic and financial systems showed remarkable resilience to the \nglobal financial crisis, largely owing to their limited exposure to toxic assets that sparked \nthe crisis. In some part, however, it also reflects the successful reforms and restructuring \nundertaken in the aftermath of the region\u2019s own crisis of 1997\u20131998. The Asian crisis \nprompted a comprehensive reform of the macroeconomic policy framework and financial \nsector regulation. Reform of macroeconomic and financial management had improved \nfiscal and external positions. The regulatory system was revamped, ensuring that financial \ninstitutions remain sound with capital adequacy ratios well above international norms. In \nthe aftermath of the Asian crisis, massive external deleveraging was undertaken by the \nprivate sector, including bank and nonbank financial institutions. As a result, the region\u2019s \nexternal vulnerability was reduced substantially. With current account surpluses from \nyears of export-driven growth, the region had also accumulated international reserves, \naccounting for 45.0% of the world\u2019s total foreign exchange reserves as of 2010. \n\nFinancial sector reforms following the Asian financial crisis centered on bank rehabilitation \nand recapitalization while upgrading in the prudential norms. Strong economic growth \nand profits strengthened banks\u2019 balance sheets (Figure 1), reduced nonperforming loans, \nand improved their resiliency against external shocks as proven in the wake of the global \nfinancial crisis. Across the region, the crisis also prompted the development of financial \nsystems beyond bank financing into, for example, government and corporate bonds, \nwhich improves financial resilience. The region\u2019s financial sectors and markets have \nbroadened and deepened in the past decade. The size of financial assets has increased \nsignificantly, with greater participation of nonbank financial institutions and capital \nmarkets, especially stock and government bond markets (Figure 2). \n\n\f4 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 285\n\nFigure 1: Banking Sector Soundness Indicators\u2014Developing Asia (percent)\n\nNonperforming\nLoans to \nTotal Loans \n\nBank Regulatory \nCapital to Risk\nWeighted Assets \n\nBank Provisions to\nNonperforming\nLoans \n\n1997\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\nNote:  Unless otherwise indicated, Developing Asia refers to Bangladesh; the People\u2019s Republic of China; Hong Kong, China; \n\nIndia, Indonesia; Kazakhstan; the Republic of Korea; the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR); Malaysia; Nepal, Pakistan; \nthe Philippines; Singapore; Sri Lanka; Thailand; and Uzbekistan.

First, development of the region\u2019s financial sectors and \nmarkets lags behind the progress of real sector economy, unable to provide necessary \nfunding and financial services for the private sector. Weak financial sectors and markets \npresent a significant constraint on economic growth and development. The region\u2019s \nfinancial sectors remain much smaller in size compared to those of advanced economies \n(Figure 3). Although wide variation exists across borders, there is room for further \nexpansion even in the region\u2019s middle-income economies. The situation is much worse in \na large number of low-income and conflict-affected economies, where the size of financial \nassets is much smaller even with a higher concentration in the banking sector (Figure 4). \nIn addition, their banking systems have very limited physical presence in the number of \nbranches and automated teller machines (Figure 5), failing to provide adequate access \nfor the public (CGAP and World Bank 2010).\n\nFigure 3: Comparison of Financial Asset Sizes, 2010 (percent of GDP)\n\n400\n\n350\n\n300\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\nDeposit-taking\nFinancial \nInstitutions\n\nNon-bank\nFinancial\nInstitutions\n\nTotal Bonds\nOutstanding\n\nDeveloping Asia\nJapan\n\nEurozone\nUnited States\n\nGDP = gross domestic product\nNote:   Market capitalization data not available for the Lao PDR and Uzbekistan.

The 1997\u20131998 crisis highlighted the risk of heavy reliance on \nbank lending, which limited financial diversity and hence threatened financial stability. \nThe absence of well-developed domestic capital markets constrains the availability of \nalternative sources for stable long-term corporate financing and thereby increases the \nrisks to the overburdened banking system from maturity and currency mismatches. \nThe lack of diversification in firms\u2019 capital structure and investors\u2019 portfolios can also \naggravate the financial position of the corporate balance sheets, should an adverse \neconomic condition dampen investment demand, triggering a sudden withdrawal of capital \nand a rush for credit crunch. \n\nThird, underdeveloped financial infrastructure combined with lack of proper legal \nand regulatory framework hinders efficient functioning of the financial sectors and \nmarkets. Basic financial infrastructure is lacking in many developing economies in the \nregion. Rapidly growing middle-income economies\u2014for example, India, Indonesia, the \nPhilippines, Thailand\u2014have strengthened financial infrastructure such as electronic \npayment systems, credit information bureaus, and collateral registries in the past \ndecade. That helped significantly enhance the efficiency of banking operations and public \nconfidence in the banking and financial systems. However, basic financial infrastructure, \nincluding necessary legal and institutional framework and governance systems, remain \ninadequate in most low-income developing economies. \n\nFinally, the region\u2019s financial sectors and markets remain largely fragmented, hindering \nthe deepening and broadening of the regional financial markets and services and thus \neffectively constraining the mobilization of the region\u2019s savings for its vast investment \nneeds. Asia as a whole is a net saver and exports a large amount of capital to advanced \neconomies3 (Table 1). This already presents an irony\u2014that capital flows from low-income \nto high-income economies. What is more ironical, however, is that a number of regional \neconomies in need of external funding for their investment import these necessary funds \nfrom outside the region. This reflects the inability of the region\u2019s financial systems to \neffectively channel the surplus funds within the region, leaving the region vulnerable to \nswings in external credit and financial conditions. \n\n3  Petri (2008) reports that the advanced economies (especially the US) imported about $0.7 trillion in capital, out of \n\nwhich $0.4 trillion came from Asia in 2005.   \n\n\f8 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 285\n\nTable 1: Savings and Investment, 2010 (US$ billion)\n\nEconomy\n\nGDP\n\nSavings\n\nGDCF\n\nSavings \n(% of GDP)\n\nGDCF \n(% of GDP)\n\nNet Savings \n(% of GDP)\n\nAsia\n   Japan* \n   Emerging Asia\n      China, People\u2019s Rep. of\n      India\n   NIEs\n      Hong Kong, China\n      Korea, Rep. of*\n      Singapore\n      Taipei,China**\n   ASEAN-5\n      Indonesia\n      Malaysia*\n      Philippines\n      Thailand\n      Viet Nam\n\n16,564 \n5,498 \n7,608 \n5,879 \n1,729 \n1,892 \n224 \n1,014 \n223 \n430 \n1,566 \n707 \n238 \n200 \n319 \n104 \n\n5,691 \n1,173 \n3,491 \n2,999 \n492 \n559 \n67 \n251 \n103 \n138 \n467 \n226 \n60 \n54 \n98 \n29 \n\nNet \nSavings\n633 \n141 \n275 \n345 \n(70)\n171 \n14 \n36 \n49 \n72 \n46 \n(4)\n32 \n13 \n15 \n(10)\n\n5,058 \n1,032 \n3,216 \n2,654 \n561 \n389 \n53 \n216 \n53 \n67 \n421 \n230 \n28 \n41 \n83 \n39 \n\n34 \n21.3 \n46 \n51.0 \n28.4 \n30 \n29.9 \n24.8 \n46.0 \n32.2 \n30 \n32.0 \n25.2 \n27.2 \n30.6 \n28.4 \n\n31 \n18.8 \n42 \n45.2 \n32.5 \n21 \n23.7 \n21.3 \n23.8 \n15.5 \n27 \n32.5 \n11.8 \n20.5 \n26.0 \n37.9 \n\n3.8 \n2.6 \n3.6 \n5.9 \n(4.0)\n9.0 \n6.2 \n3.5 \n22.2 \n16.7 \n3.0 \n(0.5)\n13.4 \n6.7 \n4.6 \n(9.5)\n\nASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations, GDCF = gross domestic capital formation, GDP = gross domestic product, NIEs = \n\nnewly industralized economies.\n*Savings and GDCF values are for 2009.\n**GDCF value is for 2009.\nSources: World Development Indicators and Global Development Finance, World Bank. Values for Taipei,China are from eng.stat.gov.tw/\n\nmp.asp?mp=5.\n\nReforming the banking and financial sector should start with the development of a \ncentral bank. Weak central banks often compound the problems of weak financial \nsectors and markets as well as inadequate financial supervision in many low-income \nand crisis-affected developing economies. In particular, the inability of central banks to \nproperly monitor the economy, formulate and conduct appropriate monetary policy, and \neffectively supervise banks is a major hurdle to development of the financial system \nin many developing economies in the region. Particularly in low-income and/or crisis-\naffected countries, public confidence in the monetary and financial systems is very low. \nAnother important complication is prevailing dollarization in a number of low-income \ndeveloping economies such as Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n(PDR), Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Viet Nam. While the impact of \ndollarization on financial sector development is still debated, it is clear that dollarization \nis a serious threat to fiscal and monetary policy effectiveness. Past studies also find that \nhigh dollarization of banks\u2019 assets may increase the banks\u2019 solvency and liquidity risks.4 \n\nBroadening financial sectors and deepening markets is also an important long-term \nagenda for creating more efficient and resilient domestic financial systems. Across \nthe region, banks play a dominant role in the financial system (Table 2). However, the \nscope of banking businesses and services are limited in many developing economies\u2014\n\n4  See Asel (2010), Duma (2011), and Menon (2007) for dollarization experiences in developing Asia.\n\n\fAsian Financial System: Development and Challenges | 9\n\nauthorities need to promote greater public access to banking; encourage banks and other \nfinancial institutions to diversify savings instruments and provide credits to traditionally \nunderserved sectors such as households and small and medium enterprises (SMEs); \nand allow diverse products to develop for better risk management. Development of \nthe nonbanking financial sector is also largely limited while the progress of capital \nmarket development is often biased toward equities. The region\u2019s equity markets have \ngrown robustly and have emerged as an important source of corporate funding in a \nfew large developing economies such as the PRC and India on the back of strong \nforeign capital inflows. However, the development of local currency bond markets has \nlagged. Government debt markets are yet to be fully functioning in many emerging and \ndeveloping economies in the region. \n\nIn the aftermath of the 1997/1998 financial crisis, East Asian economies in particular took \nvarious steps to improve the domestic financial system and promote regional financial \nintegration. They took the crisis as an opportunity to deepen financial cooperation and \nintegration\u2014both as a safeguard against the spillovers of global market instability and to \nprovide a platform for regional financial market development. Some regional initiatives are \nnoteworthy, such as the ASEAN+3 Economic Review and Policy Dialogue, the Chiang \nMai Initiative, the Asian Bond Market Initiative, and the Asian Bond Fund Initiative.5 \n\nHowever, there is much room for improvement in the region\u2019s financial integration. A \nnumber of studies find that the region\u2019s financial markets remain largely fragmented \nand provide evidence that the region\u2019s financial markets are integrated more with the \nglobal markets rather than with each other in the region (see Kim, Lee, and Shin 2008; \nHinojales and Park 2011; and Park and Lee 2011). The region\u2019s financial markets also \nlack depth and liquidity due to fragmentation and limited availability of regional financial \nproducts.

Financial Sector Development for Balanced  \nand Inclusive Growth\n\nThe global financial crisis highlighted the risk of substantial global savings and investment \nimbalances at its root. Working out these imbalances is paramount to sustaining the \npostcrisis recovery momentum and safeguarding financial stability. The crisis has made it \nclear that the world economy also needs multiple sources of growth. Asia has pulled the \nglobal economy out of recession and its strong growth is expected to contribute to a more \nbalanced and resilient global economic expansion. Given the expectations of prolonged \nweaknesses in external demand, accelerating the shift in the sources of demand toward \ndomestic and regional demand would be also largely in the region\u2019s self-interest.   \n\nFinancial sector development is essential to increasing private investment and \nconsumption, hence contributing to the rebalancing process. Across Asia, there is a \nclear need to focus efforts on financial sector development to support inclusive and \nbalanced growth. The region\u2019s predominantly bank-based financial systems have made \nconsiderable progress broadening, enhancing the reach, and improving the efficiency and \nstability of financial services since the 1997\u20131998 Asian financial crisis (Ghosh 2006). In \nmany developing economies, however, the limited access of the poor and SMEs to formal \ncredit remains an important constraint on achieving sustained high growth, development, \nand poverty reduction. \n\nThe promotion of financial access for the traditionally underserved sectors, such as \nthe poor and SMEs, is a high priority. Banks need to extend their reach to the broader \npublic, including through continued development of microfinance markets. Middle-income \neconomies need to continue their effort to diversify the financial systems by developing \nthe nonbanking sector and capital markets while at the same time improving access to \nbanking services. For low-income developing economies, however, the focus should be \non strengthening the banking systems and broadening public access to basic financial \nservices, with particular attention paid to increasing microcredit facilities. \n\nPoor households typically have uncertain income sources with limited savings in \nperishable assets. They also face substantial difficulty in managing their financial risks \ndue to limited access to any formal financial sector including insurance while relying \nheavily on social networks and their offspring. It is often very expensive for banks to \nreach out to the poor. Lack of pledgeable assets or collateral and credit information also \ncompounds the adverse condition for the poor households\u2019 credit access. Promoting \nhousing finance and mortgage markets would be helpful to strengthen households\u2019 \nfinancial position. Very little efforts have been made in the region, except for a few \n\n\f12 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 285\n\neconomies, to introduce mortgage schemes and systemically assist housing finance \ndevelopment.6 \n\nMany emerging and developing economies in the region also continue to face the \nchallenge of developing financial sectors and markets to efficiently channel domestic \nsavings into productive investment. The region\u2019s bank-dominated and underdeveloped \ncapital markets present an important hurdle to funding long-term development needs and \nthus achieving sustained high growth. Funding needs for infrastructure and SMEs are \nparticularly significant in this respect. \n\nAn important issue in bank financing of infrastructure is the asset\u2013liability mismatches. \nWhile infrastructure is typically a long-term project, banks\u2019 main funding sources are \nshort-term deposits. Therefore, funding infrastructure investment will naturally create \nsignificant asset\u2013liability mismatches in bank balance sheets. This asset\u2013liability \nmismatch problem is particularly acute in emerging Asia, where banks remain a major \nsource of corporate funding. \n\nSME financing is another important issue. In many emerging and developing economies, \nSMEs are the main pillars of production and job creation. Despite SMEs\u2019 economic \nimportance, however, banks are reluctant to lend to them because of their generally high \nbusiness risks, lack of reputation, inadequate credit information and history, and collateral. \nRelatively high nonperforming loans by SMEs and higher costs associated with managing \na large number of small accounts also discourage banks from lending to them. \n\nThe progress of SME finance varies widely across the region. The most visible progress \nhas been made in the region\u2019s middle-income economies, where secured and nonsecured \nlending regimes have been established with collateral management systems, credit \ninformation bureau, etc. But in low-income developing economies, lack of legal and \nregulatory framework, inadequate information and market transparency, weak corporate \ngovernance, and underdeveloped financial infrastructure continue to hamper effective \nSME finance.  \n\nIn order to enhance financial access by the poor and SMEs as well as meet the region\u2019s \nhuge infrastructure financing needs, strong policy intervention and support is necessary. \nFirst, legal and regulatory reforms as well as capacity building can support financial \ninstitutions to provide more efficient microfinance services. In many developing economies \nin the region, state-owned financial institutions offer commercial microfinancial services. \nHowever, their limited ability of credit assessment and risk management as well as weak \n\n6  Malaysia established Cagamas, the National Mortgage Corporation, in 1986 to serve as a special vehicle to \n\nmobilize low-cost funds to support the national home ownership policy and to spearhead the development of \nthe private debt securities market. In Thailand, there was a specific-purpose financial institution, the Government \nHousing Bank, to provide a source of finance with lower interest rates for people seeking to purchase their own \nhomes, especially those of low- and middle-income groups. In 1997, the Secondary Mortgage Corporation was \nestablished to promote and develop the secondary mortgage market.\n\n\fAsian Financial System: Development and Challenges | 13\n\ncorporate governance hamper efficient services and leave them prone to financial losses \nand bankruptcy. Inadequate monitoring and supervision of these institutions add another \nlayer of complication. \n\nIt is imperative to strengthen the legal and regulatory system including clear and \ntransparent property rights, proper insolvency arrangements, and bankruptcy procedure \nwhile enhancing credit assessment, risk management, and corporate governance. At \nthe same time, however, it is important to create an enabling environment where private \nmicrofinance institutions can thrive by removing unnecessary legal and regulatory hurdles \nto market entry and undue administrative burdens on their operations.\n\nSecond, building critical financial infrastructure such as web-based collateral registers or \ncredit information systems is essential to ensuring the efficient functions of microfinance \nmarkets. It is particularly important to build institutional and systemic support toward \neffective risk management. Credit risk managers in emerging markets have a difficult \ntask, as necessary information on credit ratings and traded security prices, for example, \ncan be hard to come by. Many microfinance institutions have very limited data on credit \ninformation and default histories of their clients. There is also little infrastructure support \nsuch as credit information bureaus. Even where there is some data availability, drastic \nchanges in the economic environment in which banks and financial institutions operate \nsince the mid-1990s across Asia would make it difficult to gauge default probabilities or \nexposures to defaults in the current situation. \n\nThird, it is important to encourage innovative ways to provide a better array of financial \nservices and products that cater to the needs of small entrepreneurs and investors while \neffectively reducing banks\u2019 operational costs. The use of innovative technology needs to \nbe positively considered and pursued. In many developing economies with low population \ndensity or disconnected geography, internet or mobile banking may help extend banks\u2019 \nreach to their remote clients. This will also help reduce the cost of setting up bank branch \nnetworks. \n\nSecuritization is another important financial innovation that is potentially very useful to \npool assets or future incomes for necessary funding for investment. In Asia, securitization \nwas used increasingly in the wake of the Asian financial crisis as a means to address \nloan losses by financial intermediaries or as a device to help bring about market-based \nfinancial sector restructuring. However, the global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009 put a \nrather abrupt stop to the growth of securitization markets worldwide. Given its great \npotential in facilitating mobilization of savings for investment by increasing the degree \nof freedom for both savers and investors to customize their financial positions that can \nfit their risk profiles and preferences, the use of securitization needs to be positively \nreviewed with a proper regulatory and monitoring framework. \n\n\f14 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 285\n\nSimilarly, developing diverse market segments such as venture capital, factoring, and \nlease markets would be a good way to improve SMEs\u2019 access to finance. The Republic \nof Korea successfully developed a well-functioning stock market for start-up SMEs to \nraise capital through publicly traded shares. Singapore established an impact investment \nexchange\u2014a social stock exchange that provides a trading platform and an efficient \ncapital-raising mechanism for social enterprises (which includes microfinance entities). \nWith a substantial portion of Asian SMEs in export industries, providing effective financial \nassistance in hedging against foreign exchange volatility and trade financing is also \nvaluable.  \n\nFinally, developing domestic capital markets and contractual savings is important to \nfinance long-term investments. A transition from short- to medium- and long-term funding, \nhowever, requires certain policy initiatives with a long-term view, such as gradually \nextending tenors of government and corporate bonds and accelerating the process of \npension reforms. Development of pension and insurance sectors has an added value of \nstrengthening the nation\u2019s social security system. \n\nThe development of liquid and well-functioning local currency bond markets provides \na venue for long-term finance for infrastructure investment. An important element to \nthis development is a strong presence of domestic institutional investors with long-term \nhorizons\u2014such as funded national pension schemes, mutual funds, and domestic \ninsurance companies. Institutional investors not only mobilize long-term savings for \nlong-term investment, but also reinforce market disciplines as they exercise the right of \ncreditors in oversight of the firm performance. \n\nIV.  Financial Sector Developments for Diversity  \nand Stability\n\nThe recent strength of Asian financial systems reflects the success of the financial sector \nand regulatory reforms undertaken in the aftermath of the 1997\u20131998 crisis. The region\u2019s \nbanking systems\u2014which play a dominant role in financial intermediation\u2014are stronger \nthan before: their balance sheets are healthy; risk management practices have generally \nimproved; and prudential oversight has strengthened. Even so, there is a large scope of \nimprovement in terms of their efficiency, inclusivity, and stability. Lack of diversity in the \nregion\u2019s financial systems is another structural weakness that may undermine systemic \nresilience and hence jeopardize financial stability.\n\nFor Asia, where banks remain the main channel for financial intermediation, building a \nstrong banking system remains a priority. Although the region\u2019s banking systems exhibited \nremarkable resilience during the latest crisis, recent developments in global financial \nmarkets and some notable changes in the region\u2019s banking business such as increasing \nhousehold lending and securities transactions require special attention (Figures 6a-b).\n\n\fAsian Financial System: Development and Challenges | 15\n\nFigure 6a: Real Estate Loans (percent of total loans) \n60\n\nHong Kong, China\n\nUnited States\n\nSingapore\n\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nTaipei,China\n\nJapan\n\nMalaysia\n\nThailand\n\nIndonesia\n\nPhilippines\n\n2000 01\n\n02\n\n03\n\n04\n\n05\n\n06\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\nSources: CEIC database; Hong Kong Monetary Authority; Bank of Indonesia; Bank of Japan; Bank Negara Malaysia; US Federal Reserve \n\nBoard; Taipei,China\u2019s central bank.\n\nFigure 6b: Securities Investment of Commercial Banks (percent of total bank assets)\n\nIndia\n\nJapan\n\nIndonesia\n\nPhilippines\n\nUnited States\n\nHong Kong, China\n\nSingapore  \n\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nThailand\n\nEuropean Union\n\nMalaysia\n\nTaipei,China\n\n2000 01\n\n02\n\n03\n\n04\n\n05\n\n06\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\nSources: CEIC database; Hong Kong Monetary Authority; Bank of Indonesia; Bank of Japan; Bank Negara Malaysia; US Federal Reserve \n\nBoard; Taipei,China\u2019s central bank.\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n50\n\n45\n\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\f16 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 285\n\nAsian banking systems returned to profit and strengthened their operational efficiency \nfollowing the reforms after the 1997\u20131998 crisis (Figures 7a-e). Earnings have improved, \nwith commercial banks venturing into new areas such as credit cards, mortgages, \ninsurance, and other retail financing. Profit performance generally improved on strong \ngrowth in noninterest income as banks strengthened their fee businesses. Net interest \nincome also improved as banks reduced operational expenses and funding costs declined \nto historically low levels, reflecting the extended period of low interest rates and strong \nliquidity conditions. However, rapid expansion of banks into unfamiliar areas may entail \nnew types of risks.

Strengthening regulatory and supervisory framework is particularly \nimportant for developing economies with a relatively weak financial market infrastructure \nto support credit risk assessment and effective risk management. It is critical that the \nminimum capital requirements are met for regulated financial institutions. But more \nimportantly, implementation of a rigorous supervisory review process needs to ensure \nthat banks maintain sound balance sheets and exercise due vigilance in their risk \nmanagement practice. Regulators also need to strengthen their capacity\u2014and be fully \nempowered\u2014to evaluate banking soundness against the rapidly evolving financial \nenvironment and assess the impact of new developments on the micro- and macro-\nprudential soundness of financial institutions, risk management, investor protection, and \nsystemic financial stability. \n\nRapid penetration of financial innovation in some parts of the region\u2019s largely \nunderdeveloped financial systems is a significant regulatory concern, while some of the \nmore advanced regional economies also need to remain vigilant against their banking \nsystem\u2019s exposures to new financial products and services. The degree of financial \ninnovation and globalization in the region\u2019s banking and financial systems may not be \nas high compared to their counterparts in industrial countries. Asia\u2019s banks held up \nwell compared to their western counterparts in large part because of their relatively low \ndegree of financial innovation and sophistication. But the region continues to embrace the \nwave of financial globalization and sophistication, brought by various factors, including \nthe increasing participation of foreign investors, the tightening global network with \nthe revolution in information and communications technology, and introduction of new \nfinancial products and services. \n\nFinancial innovation and globalization complicates local authorities\u2019 tasks of effectively \nregulating and supervising financial institutions. Despite its potential to create more \nefficient and resilient financial markets, financial innovation entails significant risks and \nuncertainties by changing the ways of financial intermediation and market functioning. \nThe past episodes of financial crises showcased the risk of innovation that challenged \nmarket participants and regulators\u2019 understanding of risk while generating overly optimistic \nviews about its benefits. A lack of institutional capacity among both financial institutions \nand regulators is another factor that can hamper effective risk monitoring and control. \n\nThe crisis also highlighted the importance of adequate information on cross-border \nfinancial activities and effective knowledge sharing. The region\u2019s regulatory authorities \nneed to have adequate information on cross-border financial activities and promote \neffective knowledge sharing perhaps through formal regional policy dialogues, which can \nalso ensure adherence to international standards and minimum regulatory principles by \nadding peer pressure. \n\n\f20 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 285\n\nLack of necessary infrastructure and institutional support continues to impair the \ndevelopment of the region\u2019s banking sector. Many low-income developing economies \nwith less developed financial systems face longer-term development issues such as \n(i) establishing legal and institutional infrastructure for finance such as creditor rights, \nprudential regulations, and insolvency regimes; (ii) building information and governance \ninfrastructure such as credit information systems, accounting and disclosure rules, and \ninternal and external auditing systems; and (iii) strengthening the role of central banks \nto provide systemic liquidity support through effective monetary operations and efficient \npayments and settlement systems. Such institutional building is also an important \nprerequisite to financial liberalization without undermining financial stability. \n\nAuthorities must also foster a broader range of financial sectors and markets\u2014including \nnonbank financial institutions, debt and equity capital markets, securitization, and \nderivatives\u2014to enhance systemic resilience and promote financial stability. Diversity \nof financial systems\u2014while meeting the demand from the society for diverse financial \nservices by accommodating various risk preferences of savers and investors\u2014helps \nreduce the risk of overreliance on banks and hence promotes financial stability. \n\nNonbank financial institutions such as private investment funds, mutual and pension \nfunds, hedge funds, insurance and leasing companies, and venture capital firms, while \ngrowing rapidly in the region\u2019s relatively more advanced economies, remain largely \nunderdeveloped (Lee and Park 2008). As shown in Table 3, in most Asian middle-income \neconomies, pension systems are relatively new with limited coverage (Park 2009). \nIn recent years, some larger middle-income countries, including the PRC, Indonesia, \nThailand, and Viet Nam, established national pension systems or strengthened their \nexisting schemes by extending coverage and improving benefits. Private pension funds \nare, however, still at an embryonic stage of development even in middle-income countries \nin Asia. With the concern of aging population growing in some large middle-income \ncountries notably in the PRC and Thailand, the process of pension reform needs to \naccelerate. \n\n\fAsian Financial System: Development and Challenges | 21\n\nTable 3: Pensions in the Asia and Pacific Region\n\nEconomy\n\nType of Pension \nScheme*\n\nPublic\n\nDB\n\nDC\n\nPrivate\nDC\n\nReplacement \nRate, 2007\n(in %)**\n\nLabour Force \nCoverage\nRate, 2007\n(in %)**\n\nRatio of Total \nPension Assets\nto GDP, 2006\n(in %)**\n\nYear Pension \nSystem was \nIntroduced\n\n\u2022\n\nAsia and Pacific\nHigh-Income\n   Hong Kong, China\n    Japan\n    Korea, Rep. of\n    Singapore\n    Taipei,China\nUpper Middle-Income\n    China, People\u2019s Rep. of\n    Malaysia\n    Thailand\nLower Middle-Income\n    India\n    Indonesia\n    Pakistan\n    Philippines\n    Sri Lanka\n    Viet Nam\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nDB = defined benefit, DC = defined contribution.\nSources: OECD (2008), Park (2009).\n\n50\n21\n\n48\n37\n33\n\n19\n\n77\n\n55\n\n48.5\n58\n\n20.5\n50\n22.5\n\n15.5\n\n27.1\n\n13.2\n\n21.1\n62.9\n\n1.3\n48.7\n4.8\n\n0.1\n\n8\n\n3.3\n\n2000\n1942\n1988\n1955\n1950\n\n1951\n1951\n1990\n\n1952\n1992\n1976\n1957\n1958\n1962\n\nBroadening and deepening domestic financial markets remains an important long-term \nagenda for more efficient and resilient financial systems. Some of Asia\u2019s stock markets \nare now as large as\u2014or even larger than\u2014those of other regional emerging markets at \nsimilar income levels. However, growth is uneven across different segments of capital \nmarkets. Especially, short-term money and fixed income markets are often shallow and \nfragmented. Except in Japan and the Republic of Korea, local currency bond markets \naccount for a smaller share of GDP than in the US or Europe. Although it is undeniable \nthat growth has been phenomenal in terms of the size of local currency bond markets, \nthis has been also driven primarily by the government bond markets. Development of the \ncorporate bond markets has been considerably lagging behind that of government bond \nmarkets (Figure 8), suggesting much remains to be done. \n\nDevelopment of local currency bond markets improves resource allocation by allowing \ngreater scope for market-determined interest rates to accommodate various risk profiles \nof the issuers; providing essential market indicators for credit and market risks, thus \nhelping risk management of financial institution; and promoting risk sharing and debtor \nmonitoring among a large number of creditors. \n\n\f22 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 285\n\nFigure 8: Government and Corporate Bond Issuance (US$ billion)\n\n1,200\n\n1,000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\nQ1\n2008 \n\nQ2  Q3  Q4  Q1\n09 \n\nQ2  Q3  Q4  Q1\n10 \n\nQ2  Q3  Q4  Q1\n11 \n\nGovernment\nCorporate\n\nNote:   Government figures include central bank issuances.

By providing an essential benchmark yield curve, a government bond \nmarket facilitates the introduction of new financial products and services. More often \nthan not in emerging markets, government securities also provide crucial market liquidity \nfor the secondary market trading and lays a foundation for market infrastructure. The \nexistence of primary issues on certain benchmark maturities, however, would not \nnecessarily create benchmarks or a benchmark yield curve, while the quoted price \nremains only indicative. \n\nWithout active secondary trading, the price discovery process is largely stalled, unable \nto provide reliable prices. Especially in many emerging markets, liquidity is often \nconcentrated on some of the benchmark issues, failing to create a continuous benchmark \nyield curve. In order to enhance market liquidity in the secondary market and induce firm \nprices for benchmark issues, authorities should establish a conducive environment for \nmarket making, such as providing hedging tools for primary dealers. To enhance liquidity \nin the secondary market, market infrastructure, including the trading, depository, clearing \nand settlement systems, need to be strengthened. Rationalizing tax impediments is also \nimportant, while streamlining regulation and accounting practices to ensure equal tax \ntreatment among different savings vehicles.\n\nDevelopment of the asset management industry can help foster the retail investor \nsegment of the market, enhancing demand and market liquidity (Figure 9). Mutual funds \n\n\fAsian Financial System: Development and Challenges | 23\n\nand various investment funds can effectively channel retail demand to the short- and \nmedium-term segment of the market. Well-developed pension and insurance sectors will \nalso have the desirable demand impact on the long-term segment of local currency bond \nmarkets in the future as the maturity of instruments gradually extends. Some middle-\nincome countries including India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand have \npromoted investment funds for the growth of the pension and insurance sector, but the \nsize of assets managed by the region\u2019s institutional investors remains much lower than \nthat of Europe and the US.\n\nFigure 9: Assets under Management, 2006 and 2009 (US$ billion)\n\nJapan\n\n3,310\n\n8,160\n\nHong Kong, China \n\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of\n\nSingapore\n\nRepublic of Korea \n\n1,066\n\n896\n\n1,072\n\n853\n\n1,063\n\n747\n\n747\n632\n\n683\n\nIndia\n\nTaipei,China\n\n334\n\n407\n\n130\n\n0\n\n1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 7,000 8,000 9,000\n\n2009\n\n2006\n\nSources: 2006 figures are from Matrix Services Limited. 2009 figures are from CEIC Database; Census and Statistics Department \n\n(Hong Kong, China); Central Provident Fund Annual Report 2010 (Central Provident Fund Board 2010); China Country Finance \nReport (Economist Intelligence Unit  2010a); India Country Finance Report (Economist Intelligence Unit 2010b); Singapore \nCountry Finance Report (Economist Intelligence Unit 2010c); Investment Company Fact Book 2011 (Investment Company \nInstitute 2011); Monetary Authority of Singapore; OECD Institutional Investors Statistics; China Financial Stability Report 2010 \n(The People\u2019s Bank of China 2010); and World Insurance 2010 (Swiss Reinsurance Company Limited 2011).\n\nDevelopment of other related investment instruments, including repurchase agreements \n(repos), forwards, interest rate swaps, futures, and other derivatives should enhance \nrisk management, contributing to financial stability. The development of a private repo \nmarket is crucial for improving market liquidity and thus facilitating price discovery. A well-\nestablished repo market also provides a link between collateral and money markets, thus \nstrengthening the market infrastructure. Establishment of a futures market may present \na great opportunity for enhancing market liquidity and transparency at an early stage of \nbond market development. By concentrating liquidity on certain generic products such as \ngovernment bond futures, the reliable and centralized price information facilitates trading \nactivities in the secondary market.\n\n\f24 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 285\n\nV.  Policy Implications\n\nThe experience of the global financial crisis underscores a new as well as unfinished \nreform agenda as the environment where financial institutions do business and markets \nfunction continue to transform with innovation and globalization. Following the crisis and \nthe G20 responses to it, significant reforms have taken place to build a stronger, more \nglobally consistent, supervisory and regulatory framework for the financial sector.7 Despite \nthe critical nature of these reforms for the future financial landscape worldwide, however, \ntheir focus has been rather exclusively on strengthening global regulatory guidelines such \nas the Basel III standards, filling the regulatory gaps, and broadening a swathe of the \ncoverage. \n\nThere is an urgent need to establish effective and collaborative implementation \nmechanisms at the national levels, reinforcing global efforts at revamping the financial \narchitecture to avoid a repeat of the crisis. However, such reform efforts should not \noverlook enormous development challenges faced by the region\u2019s low- and middle-income \ncountries and the different conditions that they face in terms of financial sector and \nmarket development, regulatory capacity, availability and flow of information, and financial \nopenness. \n\nAcross the region, there are two important reform priorities: first, there is an overriding \ninterest of economic growth and development in the context of financial stability; and \nsecond, there is the drive to create inclusive growth to support social stability and \nequity. Therefore, when considering issues related to financial sector development \nand regulatory reform, these twin objectives must be central. For Asia\u2019s emerging and \ndeveloped economies, special attention needs to be paid to the balance between growth \nand stability; and between financial innovation and regulation. In this respect, appropriate \nsequencing of reforms is important to support financial development and economic \ngrowth. Finally, issues that are pertinent for the region\u2019s financial sector development and \nregulatory reform may be summarized as follows.\n\n7 \n\nIn the wake of the unprecedented global financial crisis, the G20 Leaders gathered at the Washington Summit \nin November 2008. Under the premise of the G20\u2019s guiding principles, the Financial Stability Board and its \nconstituents sculpted specific reform proposals to strengthen financial stability. The Basel III package of capital \nand liquidity reforms\u2014the first concrete outcome of such reforms\u2014was  endorsed by the G20 Leaders at the \nNovember 2010 Seoul summit to be implemented from January 2013 and fully phased in by 1 January 2019. \nFurther reform is ongoing in the areas of strengthening macroprudential policy frameworks; studying regulation \nand supervision of commodities and futures markets; improving market integrity and efficiency; enhancing \nconsumer protection; strengthening regulation and supervision of shadow banking; and assessing regulatory \nreform issues, which are especially relevant to emerging markets and developing economies.\n\n\fAsian Financial System: Development and Challenges | 25\n\n(i) \n\n(ii)\t\n\nSupporting economic growth and development: Developing Asia\u2019s \nunderdeveloped financial systems remain an important constraint on \nfunding necessary development and ensuring sustained high growth. \nThere is a clear need to focus efforts on financial sector development to \nsupport growth, in the context of establishing necessary foundations of \nfinance and financial infrastructure, such as effective payment systems, \nclear and transparent property rights, information infrastructure, corporate \ngovernance structure, and strong legal and regulatory framework, including \ninsolvency and dispute resolution systems. In the context of financial sector \ndevelopment, particular attention needs to be paid to the region\u2019s financial \nneeds for infrastructure and for SMEs, and promoting financial inclusion of \nlow-income households. In the context of banking, it is important to extend \nthe banking service to a broader portion of the population, especially \nSMEs, including through continued development of microfinance markets. \nIn the context of securities markets, infrastructure, transparency, and \ncorporate governance are central to development (as well as stability), not \nonly in equity markets but also in debt markets. \n\nPromoting\tfinancial\tinclusion: Financial inclusion empowers people, \nparticularly the poor, women, and marginalized sectors of society to \nparticipate in business and economic activity. At the Pittsburgh Summit in \n2009, the G20 leaders committed to improving access to financial services \nfor the poor (Group of Twenty 2009b). It is agreed that the G20 supports \nthe safe and sound spread of new modes of financial service delivery \ncapable of reaching the poor and, building on the example of microfinance, \nwill scale up the successful models of SME financing. Further efforts \nneed to be made to increase public access to banking; promote financial \nliteracy and consumer protection; provide adequate credit to promote \nentrepreneurship; diversify savings instruments; and develop appropriate \nproducts and markets for better risk management. It would be helpful \nto encourage a more innovative approach to doing them. Necessary \nlegislative/regulatory reform can also ensure that financial institutions and \nmarkets provide affordable credits, savings accounts, and basic insurance \nto the financially excluded sectors. \n\n(iii) \n\nBalancing regulation and innovation: The key challenge for regulators \nin emerging and developing economies is how to encourage and manage \nfinancial market development without stifling innovation. Regulators \nshould be wary of complex innovations that make the underlying risks \nof products or services more difficult to assess or trace\u2014whether by \nbank management, regulators, or investors. However, an important \ndistinction should be made between the basic elements for financial \nmarket development and risky financial innovation. For many developing \n\n\f26 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 285\n\neconomies, simple innovation\u2014creating and utilizing new financial \ninstruments, technologies, and services such as securitization and \nderivatives\u2014could be very useful to broaden access to finance and \npromote financial efficiency and resiliency. \n\n(iv)\t\n\nStrengthening\tcrisis\tprevention\tand\tmanagement\tmechanisms: \nThe global financial crisis highlighted the need for an effective national, \nregional, and global framework to ensure financial stability. At the national \nlevel, it would imply that a comprehensive framework and contingency plan \nfor financial institution failure is needed, including consumer protection \nmeasures such as deposit insurance. At the regional level, establishing \nregional and subregional fora would be of added value to support regional \neconomic and financial cooperation, policy coordination, and crisis \nassistance, while complementing and augmenting the role of G20 and \nthe Financial Stability Board. Asia also needs to actively participate in the \nreform of the international financial architecture and establishment of global \nfinancial safety nets to enhance crisis prevention and management.\n\nReferences\n\nADB. 2008.

Cyn-Young Park explores the key development agenda \nof Asian financial systems that aims to promote economic growth and development \nthrough well-functioning financial markets and, in the process, bolster inclusive growth \nto support social stability and equity in the region. Pertinent issues in the region\u2019s \nfinancial sector development include: (i) supporting economic growth and development, \n(ii) promoting financial inclusion, (iii) balancing regulation and innovation, and  \n(iv) strengthening crisis prevention and management mechanisms.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its \ndeveloping member countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their \npeople. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the \nworld\u2019s poor: 1.8 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million \nstruggling on less than $1.25 a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through \ninclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional \nintegration. \n \nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its \nmain instruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, \nequity investments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\n\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/economics\nISSN: 1655-5252\nPublication Stock No. WPS124250 \n\nNovember 2011\n\nPrinted on recycled paper\n\n< 0 1 2 4 2 5 08 >\n\nPrinted in the Philippines\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 285\n", "Asian Financial System:  \nDevelopment and Challenges\n", "Cyn-Young Park \nNovember 2011\n", "Cyn-Young Park is Assistant Chief Economist of the Economic Analysis and Operations Support Division, \nEconomics and Research Department, Asian Development Bank.
