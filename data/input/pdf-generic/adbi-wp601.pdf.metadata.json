INTRODUCTION \nIndonesia adopted a wide range of social reforms (reformasi) after the fall in February \n1998 of President Suharto, who had been in power for 32 years from 1966 to 1998. \nFirst, the reform ended the authoritarian military-led political system and replaced it \nwith an expensive democratic multiparty system. The political role of the military ended \nwith the abolishment of its dual function or direct role in politics. Second, the reform \nended the dominant role of the government in the economy and started a move toward \na market-based economic system and a globalized open economy. A third aspect of \nthe reform was a \u201cbig bang\u201d approach to wide-ranging decentralization by giving both \ngreater political power and budgets to local governments. It is a uniform system under \nwhich  all  subnational  governments  in  Indonesia  operate.  This  democratic  and \nautonomous  system  replaced  the  previous  system  of  centralized  government  and \ndevelopment planning. Fourth, the government in 2003\u20132004 introduced a package of \nthree modern laws on state finance covering state treasury and auditing management \nand accountability. The new system replaced the antiquated cash-based, single-entry \nsystem with a modern double-entry accounting system and uses a single treasury \naccount, transparent management of the public treasury, expenditure and financial \ncontrol  with  performance  indicators  and  computerized  reporting,  and  a  tightly \nscheduled auditing system.  \nWithout much preparation, through Laws No. 22/1999 and No. 25/1999, the central \ngovernment abruptly transferred political authorities and financial resources to the third \nlevel  of  government  of  Indonesia.  These  two  laws  decentralized  political  \nand  economic  powers  away  from  the  central  government  after  decades  of  highly \ncentralized and autocratic rule. Bypassing the provincial government, the laws provide \ndistricts (kabupaten) and municipalities (kota) at the subprovincial level, with greater \ninvolvement in the management of their day-to-day affairs and in the provision of  \npublic  goods  to  satisfy  regional  interests,  and  it  was  hoped  this  would  result  in  \nbetter  local  service  delivery.  Laws  No.  22/1999  and  No.  32/2004  give  authority  \nto local governments to execute a wide range of responsibilities in areas such as \nhealth, education, public works, environment, communication, transport, agriculture, \nmanufacturing industry and trade, capital investment, land, cooperatives, labor force, \nand infrastructure services. Law No. 23/2014 and revised Law No. 32/2004 itemize the \nresponsibilities of the subnational governments.  \nThe  decentralization  of  government  functions,  however,  was  not  followed  up  with \nequipping  subnational  governments  with  the  capacity  to  produce  public  goods, \nincrease  productivity  and  employment,  and  promote  economic  growth  in  their \njurisdictions.  Before  the  reform,  subnational  governments  had  mainly  functioned  \nas implementing agencies of national policies and programs. The number of good \nfinancial managers, as required by the new laws of public treasury and auditing, was \nalso limited. Because of long periods of centralization, local governments never built \nthe  necessary  capacity  for  economic  planning  or  to  take  initiatives  to  promote \neconomic growth in their jurisdictions. The rising revenues of local governments do not \nfollow their increasing government functions to promote economic development that \ncould potentially cause fiscal imbalances. On the other hand, the central government \nlacks  the  capability  to  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  government  functions \ntransferred to the subnational level, to monitor subnational governments\u2019 spending \npatterns and efforts.  \n   \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 601  A. Nasution \n \nUnlike in many developing and transitioning countries, the decentralization program  \nin Indonesia did not cause major political or economic problems. Only the former \nProvince of East Timor seceded to establish the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste  \nin  1989.  Supported  by  the  West  during  the  Cold  War,  Indonesia  had  absorbed  \nTimor-Leste  in  1976  after  a  coup  d\u2019\u00e9tat  led  by  the  communist-leaning  military  in \nPortugal. The region was not part of the original Indonesia as it had been a colony of \nPortugal until 1976. \nTo preserve the unity of the country and end the sporadic rebellious independent \nmovements, Aceh and Papua were granted more autonomous powers in local decision \nmaking  in  four  areas:  (i)  religious  affairs,  (ii)  local  customs  and  institutions,  (iii) \neducation and (iv) local development policy. Law No. 4/2001 splits Papua into two \nprovinces,  namely,  Papua  and  West  Papua.  Under  the  Helsinki  Accord,  peace \nagreement was signed with the Aceh Free Movement (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka [GAM]) \non  15  August  2015.  Law  No.  11/2006  establishes  the  province  Aceh  Nangru \nDarussalam (NAD) that uses Islamic shariah law.  \nThe rest of this paper is divided into three parts. Section 2 describes the institutional \nsetting:  division  of  responsibilities  between  the  central  and  local  governments, \ngovernment financing, and administration of public funds and state-owned enterprises. \nSection 3 discusses revenues of local governments and fiscal transfer from the central \ngovernment  to  address  horizontal  imbalances  of  local  government.  Section  4 \nsummarizes the findings. \n2.  INSTITUTIONAL SETTING \n2.1  Division of Responsibilities between Levels of Government \nIndonesia is a unitary republic and is divided into five layers of government: central, \nprovinces, kabupaten (districts) and kota (municipalities), kecamatan (subdistricts), and \nkelurahan/desa (villages). Prior to the present reform, there had only been very little \nimplementation  of  effective  devolution  of  authority  and  financial  resources  to  \nlower tiers of government. The central government appointed local officials, carried  \nout  central  planning,  and  directly  provided  financing  to  local  governments  for  the \nproduction of public goods and the financing of the general administration. To assure \npolitical loyalty to the regime, most of the appointed heads of local governments, from \nthe provinces down to kelurahan, were from the military services (mainly the army) and \npolice force. The regional heads were also assigned to eradicate communism from the \nvillage level and the rural sector. \nThe rapid proliferation of local governments since 1998 has increased fragmentation \nand  instability  because  of  local  interracial,  interethnic,  and  interreligious  conflicts  \nand violence as well as the unstable presidential and multiparty system. The present \ndecentralization  and  political  democracy  makes  the  decision-making  process more \ndifficult as the decision makers must accommodate the interests of conflicting political \nparties and districts. As noted earlier, Aceh and Papua were granted special authority \nin dealing with local customs, education, religion, and local development policy. In \ntheory, the accountability system should have been improved as it is now basically \norganized around a triangular relationship between the heads of districts/mayors, the \nlocal parliaments, and the community (voters). The heads of the local governments and \nthe members of local parliaments are supposed to be accountable to the community \nthrough regular elections. In reality, they are mainly accountable to the parties and not \nto the public. A potential candidate has to pay the political parties to get nominated in \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 601  A. Nasution \n \nthe local election. The positions of heads of kabupaten and kota are often handed \ndown to their wives and family members. \nDuring the past authoritarian military regime, the governors, and mayors and heads  \nof districts were appointed by the central government. Most of the heads of local \ngovernments, from governors of provinces to village heads, were active or retired \nmilitary or police officers. As they were appointed by the central government, the \nappointed officers faced strong political and fiscal incentives to be accountable to \nsuperiors at higher levels of government rather than to local communities. The highly \ncentralized fiscal structure further reduced accountability, adversely affected the rates \nof return on public sector projects, and constrained development of local institutions. At \nthat time, Golkar was the dominant party, supported by both the military and the civil \nservants. Under the dual function system, the military was directly involved in politics. \nUnder this system, 10% of the seats in the central and local parliaments were reserved \nfor the military and police, and party candidates received the rest based on their rank \non the party list. \nAt  present,  the  technical  capabilities  of  the  local  bureaucracies,  Parliament,  and \npolitical parties at the regional level are insufficient to meet the rising demand for \nbusiness planning, managing state funds, and implementing development programs. \nPrior to 1999, provincial government had a small office, the Provincial Development \nBoard  or  BAPPEDA  (Badan  Perencanaan  Pembangunan  Daerah),  responsible  for \nplanning  how  to  use  the  small  provincial  budget.  Local  capability  was  limited  to \nencouraging economic growth and creating jobs by promoting private investment and \nexports. Decentralization has created new oligarchs at the local levels. Corruption, \ncollusion, and nepotism are now widespread in local governments. Most of the districts \ndid not have the technical staff to implement the newly obtained powers. Because of \nthese  institutional  weaknesses,  the  decentralization  program  has  not  been  very \nsuccessful at bringing local policies and local public goods closer to the people. \nWith the reforms, the number of provinces increased by seven, from 27 in 1980 to 34 in \n2013  (Table  1).  Timor-Leste  seceded  from  Indonesia  to  become  an  independent \ncountry in 1999. As it was not part of the Dutch colony, Timor-Leste was not part of the \noriginal Republic of Indonesia. Afraid of communist revolution in Portugal, Indonesia \nabsorbed the region in 1975 with the approval of the Western countries. During the \nsame period, the number of districts (kabupaten) increased from 246 to 413 and the \nnumber  of  municipalities  (kota)  from  54  to  98.  At  the  same  time,  the  number  of \nsubdistricts (kecamatan) increased from 3,349 to 9,982 and the number of villages \n(desa) rose from 65,372 to 80,414.  The top five provinces with the highest populations \nin 2013 were West Java, East Java, Central Java, North Sumatra, and Banten. All the \npopulous provinces, except North Sumatra, are on Java Island. The top five provinces \nwith  the  largest  areas  are  Papua  and  West  Papua  on  Papua  Island;  and  North \nKalimantan,  East  Kalimantan,  and  Central  Kalimantan  on  Kalimantan  Island.  The \ncapital city of Jakarta is the smallest province in terms of area, and North Kalimantan \nhas the smallest population.  \n   \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 601  A.

At present, \nthe power of central government is limited to six broad areas\u2014finance, foreign affairs, \ndefense, security, religion, and state administration and justice. These functions include \ninternational policies and implementation of treaties with foreign countries, citizenship \nand immigration, judicature, external trade, national monetary and fiscal policy, national \nplanning,  macroeconomic  national  development  control,  currency,  banking  and \ninsurance, financial balance fund, state administration and state economic institutional \nsystems, human resources development, natural resources utilization, strategic high \ntechnology, conservation, and national standardization. \nTo pacify sporadic armed secessionist movements in Aceh and Papua, the central \ngovernment granted these two regions greater autonomy to deal with local affairs and \nmore revenue sharing in 2000. Aceh was allowed to adopt an Islamic Syariah legal \nsystem in parallel to the national one. A Syariah Council was established to ensure that \nthe local governor and Parliament are in line with Islamic teachings. Each province in \nPapua  has  a  Papua  Council  to give  advice  to  local  governors  and the  House  of \nRepresentatives. The two provinces also have their own provincial flag and anthem. \nIn contrast to most of the countries that give autonomy to provincial and state levels  \nof government, Laws No. 22/1999 and No. 25/1999 of Indonesia give autonomy directly  \nto the regencies and municipalities at the subprovincial level. The laws give local \ngovernments  responsibilities  and  authority  to  determine  the  size  and  structure  of \nbudget expenditure. Compared with local governments, provinces have only limited \nresponsibilities. The provincial governments have double roles as autonomous regional \ngovernments and as regional representatives of the national government. They are \nresponsible for supervisory functions and are supposed to intervene in matters that \nrequire cross-jurisdictional cooperation. As the regional representatives of the central \ngovernment,  the  provincial  governments  are  expected  to  oversee  and  closely \nsupervise, making decentralization work more effectively. \nThe present structure of the government administration in Indonesia was designed  \nto unleash centrifugal tendencies and prevent secessionist movements by allowing \ncentral  government  to  mediate  differences  between  districts,  municipalities,  and \nprovinces. During the colonial era, the Dutch deliberately made the provinces weak to \nmake it easier to colonialize the country. Strong centralized government policies were \ncontinuously adopted to safeguard the unitary state against secessionist movements \nand rebellions after independence. The provinces have no hierarchical authority over \nsubordinate  governments  and  perform  largely  coordinating  tasks.  In  the  transition \nperiod, provinces may undertake tasks that specific districts may not be in a position to \nperform except in education, health, and infrastructure.  \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 601  A. Nasution \n \n2.2  Government Finance \nAt present, local governments are given significant control over expenditure, which \nreduces the control exerted by the central government. On the other hand, the power  \nof  local  governments  to  collect  tax  and  borrow  remains  very  limited.  The  central \ngovernment  collects  major  taxes  and  can  borrow  from  domestic  and  international \nfinancial markets. To keep inflation low, the central government stopped inflationary \nfinancing in 1996 to finance the budget deficit through borrowing directly from Bank \nIndonesia, the central bank. \nUnder the administration of President Suharto, nearly all of government revenue from \nnatural resources; tax and nontax, including land and property taxes; foreign aid; and \nloans were collected and received by the central government. The central government \nalso  tightly  controlled  both  the  size  and  structure  of  budget  expenditure  of  local \ngovernments. Only minor taxes were assigned to the local governments. The rates of \nthese taxes were set by the central government within ranges specified in the law. \nMajor taxes were collected by the Directorate General of Taxation at the Ministry of \nFinance. Until recently, the central government had collected tax on land and buildings. \nAfter the reform, the originating provinces and districts received part of the tax revenue \ngenerated from natural resources. \nPrior to the introduction of Law No. 17/2003, only the central government was allowed \nto borrow from both domestic and foreign financial markets. As soon as it consolidated \nits power in 1966, the New Order Government of President Suharto ended inflationary \nfinancing to finance the budget deficit. Prior to that, the government had financed its \nbudget deficit through printing money and by selling government bonds in the primary \nmarket, directly to Bank Indonesia. The end of monetary financing rapidly reduced \ninflation, from over 650% in 1966 to slightly below 10% in 1969. This allowed the New \nOrder government to start the first Five Year Plan on 1 April 1969. After that, the \nstrategy  for  financing  the  budget  deficit  was  shifted  to  financing  of  the  central \ngovernment budget deficit through foreign aid and loans from official sources (Official \nDevelopment Assistance [ODA]) with long-term maturity and concessionary rates. A \nconsortium  of  Western  creditors,  the  Inter  Government  Group  on \nIndonesia/Consultative Group on Indonesia, was established in 1966 to finance the \nentire budget deficit of President Suharto\u2019s administration for 32 years. Over that long \nperiod, both the governments and the parliaments of the donor countries approved \ntheir budget allocations to help finance the budget deficits of Indonesia. At that time, \nIndonesia met the conditionality requirements imposed by its diverse foreign creditors.  \nThe ODA financing of the public debt ended after the fall of President Suharto in May \n1998 Since then, Indonesia has issued sovereign bonds floated both in domestic and \ninternational markets to finance the budget deficits and has recapitalized its financially \nailing banks. Law No. 23/1999 on Bank Indonesia continues the policy of prohibiting \nmoney printing for financing the budget deficit. At present, local governments neither \nissue  government  debt  nor  use  public\u2013private  partnership  to  finance  their  \nlong-term expenditure, such as for building infrastructure. To solve their short-term \nliquidity  problems,  local  governments  usually  borrow  from  commercial  banks, \nparticularly from their own regional development banks (bank pembangunan daerah \n[BPD]), while waiting for disbursements of transfers from the central government. Every \nprovince, and subprovincial government, has a BPD that acts as a cashier for its \nowners. \nDuring the era of President Suharto, central government re-lent some of its foreign  \naid,  and  loans  were  distributed  to  subnational  governments.  In  1988,  the  central \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 601  A. Nasution \n \ngovernment established a Regional Development Account (RDA) as the main source of \ndomestic loans to finance both local governments and local enterprises. Foreign and \ndomestic loans were used by subnational governments for local investment projects \nsuch as village improvement projects, urban drinking water supply projects, and market \nfacilities/small  shopping  centers.  Central  government  injected  sovereign  bonds  to \nrecapitalize the financially distressed Regional Development Banks during the 1997\u201398 \nAsian financial crisis.  \nThe authority of the central government under the administration of President Suharto \nwas strengthened as it centralized development planning and distributed development \nprojects and funds to the lower levels of government through a plethora of Presidential \nInstructions  (Instruksi  Presiden  [Inpres]).  International  donors,  including  the  World \nBank, the Asian Development Bank, and the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment,  funded  some  of  the  Inpres  programs  such  as  urban  and  rural \ndevelopment  projects, reforestation,  and regreening. The  Central  Planning  Agency \n(Badan Perencanaan dan Pembangunan Nasional [BAPPENAS]) mainly determined \nthe total size and allocation of the general and specific Inpres programs. Aside from \nsetting  designs  and  standards  for  public  services,  the  line  ministries  or  technical \ndepartments also played a role in the cases of specific grants.  \nThere were eight Inpres programs\u2014Village Development Grant (Inpres Desa), District \nDevelopment  Grant  (Inpres  Dati  II),  Provincial  Development  Grant  (Inpres  Dati  I), \nPrimary School Grant (Inpres Sekolah Dasar [SD]), Health Grant (Inpres Kesehatan), \nRegreening/Reforestation  Grant  (Inpres  Penghijauan/Reboisasi),  Road  Grant  for \nMunicipalities and Districts (Inpres Jalan Dati II), and Road Grant for Provinces (Inpres \nJalan Provinsi). The Village Development Grant was given as a subsidy for villages, \nwhere the District Development Grant was awarded based on population size. The \nPrimary School Grant was used for operational costs, rehabilitation, new construction, \nadditional classrooms, and books. The Health Grant was provided to cover medicine, \nhealth centers, health sub-centers, mobile health centers, and to pay for salaries of \ndoctors and paramedics, health centers rehabilitation, and basic medicines as well as \nclean water. Regreening and reforestation grants were used to cover expenses for \nregreening,  reforestation,  and  field  staff.  Road  Grants  for  Dati  I  and  Dati  II  were \nawarded based on the length, condition, or density of roads, and the per unit price of \ntheir maintenance. \nThe central government also tightly supervises the regions through unified auditing  \nof all public sector finances, including state-owned enterprises and enterprises owned \nby regional governments, centralized at the Supreme Audit Board (Badan Pemeriksa \nKeuangan [BPK]). The BPK is the external auditor of the government that annually \naudits financial reports of the entire public sector from the central to the kabupaten and \nkota levels. During the authoritarian regime of Orde Baru, the BPK was practically \ncontrolled by the government as it controlled its staff, budget, and auditing methods. To \nassure  the  transparency  and  accountability  of  government  finances,  \nLaw  No.  15/2004  on  Auditing  Management  and  Accountability  of  State  Finance \nrestored the independence and autonomy of the BPK. The new law expands the type \nof audit from financial audit to include compliance and performance audit. To carry  \nout its audit function, the BPK established its representative offices in all capital cities \nof the provinces. The audit reports of the BPK are presented to the Parliament of \ncentral government and to the Parliaments of both provincial and kabupaten and kota \ngovernments, and the reports are made available to the general public through the \nBPK website.  \n   \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 601  A. Nasution \n \nIn  addition  to  BPK,  the  government  has  three  layers  of  internal  control  (Badan \nPemeriksa  Keuangan  Pemerintah  [BPKP]),  and  Inspector  Generals  of  the  line \nministries and provincial governments. Originally, BPKP was under the Ministry of \nFinance, but it moved to the office of the Vice President and subsequently shifted to \nThe  Ministry  for  Supervision  of  the  State  Apparatus  (Kementerian  Pengawasan \nApparatur Negara [Menpan]). Both the external and internal auditors review the sizes \nof  the  budget  of  regional  governments,  the  sources  of  the  revenue,  and  their \nexpenditure. \n2.3  Fiscal Reforms  \nThe  allocation  of financial  resources to  each  level  of government  is  important for  \ntwo  main  reasons.  First,  it  would  enable  each  level  of  government  to  exercise \nconstitutionally  assigned  legislative  and  executive  responsibilities.  Second,  taxing \npowers and expenditure are important policy instruments for the three objectives of \nmacroeconomic  policy\u2014maintaining  economic  stability,  pursuing  high  economic \ngrowth,  and  equity.  The  stabilization  function  is  normally  assigned  to  the  central \ngovernment to maintain internal and external economic stability.  \nThe  budget  constraint of  the  subnational governments,  both  at the provincial  and \nkabupaten and kota levels, can be written as: \nG \u2013 (T + P) = A + \u0394D + TRA  (1) \nwhere,  \nG is government expenditure; \nT is own-source revenue or government tax and nontax revenue;  \nP is profit from enterprises owned by local government, privatization, and rent from \nleasing of assets of the local government; \nA is revenue from sale of assets, including privatization of state-owned enterprises and \nrent from leasing of state assets; \nD is government debt. At present, the subnational governments can only borrow from \ndomestic  sources:  (i)  central  government,  (ii)  other  subnational  governments,  and \n(iii) domestic banks and non-bank financial institutions. Floating bonds in the domestic \nmarket requires permission from the Ministry of Finance. Subnational governments \ncannot directly receive grants or borrow from overseas;  \nTRA is the central government transfer to local governments, provinces, kabupaten, \nand kota\u2014also known as Equalization Funds or Transfer (Dana Perimbangan); and \n\u0394 is change or difference operator. \nDecentralization  in  Indonesia  only  gives  autonomy  to  the  local  government  to \ndetermine the size and structure of their budget expenditure. Taxing power remains \nwith the central government, while local governments are only given the right to collect \nminor taxes such as taxes on land and building, motor vehicles, hotels, restaurants, \nentertainment, base metal and mineral extraction, and water. Local governments do \nnot have the power to impose and collect customs and excise, corporate tax, personal \nincome  tax,  and  sales  tax.  Until  recently,  collecting  land  and  property  taxes  had  \nbeen  in  the  hands of the  central  authorities  even  though  the country  was  rapidly \nurbanizing, with 49.4% of its population in 2011 living in big cities. This means that \nwealth is increasingly vested and locked up in land and property. The low municipal \nrevenue-to-gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  ratio,  at  1%,  indicates  that  urban  and \nproperty taxes are still untapped. Local governments also have no right to modify tax \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 601  A. Nasution \n \nrates according to their needs. Both assessment and tax rates are uniform for the \nwhole country, and local governments do not have control over the rate structure for \ntheir major sources of revenue. \nMany affluent local governments, particularly in the urban sectors, sell or lease their \nland to private developers for commercial uses. Some public parks, playgrounds, and \nsport fields have been converted into shopping malls and hotels, and other commercial \nbuildings. Those in rural areas can raise funds from issuing licenses for opening up \nvirgin forest for small operators of commercial logging, plantation, and mining that \ncould damage the environment. \nSince the introduction of Law No. 17/2003, local governments have been allowed to \nborrow from both domestic and foreign markets. Local governments, however, require \npermission from the Ministry of Finance for issuing local debts. The law adopts the \nfiscal and debt rules of the European Union by limiting the budget deficits of central and \nlocal governments to 3% of their respective annual GDP or regional GDP. The ratio of \ndebt to GDP or regional GDP is set at a maximum of 60%. \nSo far, nearly 40% of central government expenditure has been transferred to the \nregional governments. The high transfer to subnational governments does not cause \nfiscal  strain  in  the  national  public  sector  or  deficits  that  pose  a  major  threat  to \nmacroeconomic stability. At present, the budget deficit of the central government is \nbelow the limit of 3% of annual GDP and the ratio of public debt is about 27%, much \nlower than the maximum limit of 60%. \nThere are three main sources of revenue for local governments:  \n(i)  local governments\u2019 own source of revenue  (Pendapatan Asli Daerah), \nwhich includes local retribution and small amounts of revenue from profits of \npublic enterprises owned by local governments, and revenue from their \nprivatization and lease;   \n(ii)  tax and revenue sharing from income, corporate tax, and tax on natural \nresources; and  \n(iii)  transfers from the central government.  \nAs noted earlier, the grant from the central government to the local governments has \ntwo components. The first component is a minimum allocation known as the General \nAllocation Fund (Dana Alokasi Umum [DAU]). DAU is a lump sum given to all local \ngovernments regardless of their fiscal gap and is mainly intended to cover the salaries \nof civil servants. The second portion of DAU is a fiscal gap component, which is the \ndifference  between  own  fiscal  capacity  and  fiscal  needs.  Most  local  government \nfinancing comes from DAU, which accounted for more than 60% of their total revenue. \nThis indicates the high dependency of local government budgets on grants from the \ncentral government to finance local service provision. Law No. 22/1999 establishes a \nfloor of 25.5% of domestic revenue (including oil and gas revenue) for transfer to \nsubnational levels through DAU or a general block grant that equalizes regional needs \nand revenue capacities.  \nEqualization Grant (Dana Bagi Hasil [DBH]) is the second transfer from central to \nsubnational governments. This DBH is the revenue sharing or tax sharing from the \ngeneral tax revenue and revenue from the exploitation of natural resources, including \nmining,  oil,  and  gas  revenue.  This  exacerbates  horizontal  imbalances  between \nprovinces and districts. Some areas receive revenue sharing for reforestation.  \nThe  third  transfer  is  the  Special  Allocation  Funds  (Dana  Alokasi  Khusus  [DAK]) \nprovided  to  finance  central  government  initiatives  implemented  by  the  region, \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 601  A. Nasution \n \nparticularly in remote and less developed areas. This is a special purpose grant similar \nto  a  capital-financing  program.  As  it  is  given  to  all  local  governments,  there  is \ncompetition between the recipients for effective implementation of the programs. Also, \nthere  is  neither  a  bonus  scheme  nor  an  incentive  scheme  to  encourage  local \ngovernments to compete for improvements in the implementation of the programs.  \nAt the provincial level, the DAK grants are used for provincial road improvements, \ndevelopment of regional art and culture, and rural extension services. At the district \nlevel,  the  DAK  grants  are  used  for  basic  education  and  preventive  health  care,  \ndistrict  road  development,  basic  infrastructure,  district  markets,  and  small-scale \nindustry development. The block grant can only be used for development purposes, \nprimarily infrastructure.  \nOn  top  of  these,  the  central  government  provides  emergency  financing  to  cover  \nbudget deficits of subnational governments due to natural disasters, and to restore  \ntheir solvability. \n2.4  Debt Financing \nAt present, none of the subnational government in Indonesia has floated local currency \nbonds  to  diversify  funding  and  attract  the  financing  required  for  investment  in \ninfrastructure.  In  general,  debt  financing  is  only  available  for  wealthy  subnational \ngovernments in countries with mature financial markets with good rule of law that \nprovides transparent information, protects property rights, and enforces contracts. In \nthe case of Indonesia, accounting standard or practices, disclosure requirements and \ncorporate governance of the issuers, and bankruptcy law and procedures need to be \nimproved.  Debts  are  to  be  repaid  from  the  revenue  generated  by  investment  in \nproduction activities. Indonesia does not have cash-rich domestic institutional investors \nsuch as insurance companies, pension and mutual funds, or a shadow banking system \nto absorb the bonds. Unlike in some European countries and Japan, Indonesia does \nnot have a rich Postal Savings Bank (Cargill and Yoshino 2003). \nUntil now, in terms of assets and branch networks, the commercial banking industry \nhas  been  the  core  of  the  financial  system  in  Indonesia.  Financial  intermediation \nprimarily takes the form of bank lending rather that the issuing of bonds or equity in the \ncapital market. Much of the credit is collateralized against land. Bank operations are \nmainly concentrated on traditional deposit taking and lending, and less focused on the \ncapital and bond market. This is because of the long period of financial repression \nduring President Suharto\u2019s administration from 1966 to 1998. The availability of low-\ncost and low-risk credit from state-owned banks reduces the needs of the business \nsector to float bonds or issue equity shares. \n2.5  State-owned Enterprises \nIndonesia has a mixed economy. In addition to the provision of public goods, the public \nsector at all levels has state-owned enterprises (SOEs) producing private goods that \noperate  in  many  sectors  of  the  economy,  including  oil  and  mining;  plantations; \nelectricity; sea, air, and land transport; hotels; and shops. The government also has \nland  and  productive  forest.  Some  of  the  SOEs  originated  from  the  former  Dutch \ncompanies nationalized during the conflict over the present Papua in the mid-1950s. \nSome former  British  companies  were  nationalized  during  the military confrontation \nwhen Malaysia and Singapore gained independence from England. Companies owned \nby communist suspects and those that were regarded as being close to President \nSukarno and PKI (Partai Komunis Indonesia) or the Indonesian Communist Party were \n9 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 601  A. Nasution \n \ntaken over after the collapse of the communist rebellion in 1965. At present, there are \n414 enterprises which are owned by the government under the management of the \nMinistry of State Owned Enterprises. There are 650 enterprises, including drinking \nwater companies and marketplaces, owned and managed by local governments (Table \n2). Through owning golden shares, the government retains exclusive rights to make \nappointments to the Boards of Commissioners and the Boards of Directors as well as \nappoint key officers of SOEs, and to intervene in their day-to-day operations. \nTable 2: Number of Local State-owned Enterprises: Provinces and Local \nGovernments \nYear  Provinces  Local Governments \n2005  90  518 \n2009  91  595 \n2010  92  603 \n2011  95  619 \n2012  100  626 \n2013  108  650 \nSource: Central Bureau of Statistics. 2014. Statistical Yearbook of Indonesia 2014. \nSome losses of the SOEs during the era of President Suharto, including subsidized \nlending and directed credit of the state banks, are quasi-fiscal activities by the public \nbanks.  At  that  time,  the  subsidized  loans  were  primarily  received  by  politically  \nwell-connected groups. These contingent liabilities of the government became future \nbudget commitments of the government that were not recognized until cash payments \nhad been made.  \nAll  provinces  have  RDBs  as  a  legacy  of  the  past  to  mobilize  long-term  savings  \nfor financing long-term investment projects in their respective provinces. In reality,  \nthey operate as cashiers for their owners\u2014the provincial and Kabupaten and Kota \ngovernments. In practice, the regional development banks save the funds transferred \nfrom the central government to the local governments and recycle them back to Jakarta \nto be invested in SBI (Sertifikat Bank Indonesia) or Bank Indonesia Certificates and \ngovernment bonds. Most of their credits are given to buy vehicles and housing for local \ncivil servants. \n2.6  Administration of Public Sector\u2019s Funds \nTo  reform  the  fiscal  system  and  bring  it  into  line  with  international  practices,  the \nnational Parliament passed three laws on state finance in 2003 and 2004: Law No. \n17/2003 on State Finance, Law No. 1/2004 on State Treasury, and Law No. 15/2004 \non Auditing Management and Accountability of State Finance. The laws impose a \nuniform  system  of  financial  accounts,  audit  rules,  and  disclosure  requirements  for \nborrowing by all levels of government. Six distinct reforms were introduced to address \nthe weaknesses of the past fiscal system:  \n(i)  End the separation between routine and development budget. During the \nadministration of the New Order, all routine expenditure was financed by the \ngovernment\u2019s own revenue. The financing of the development budget came \nfrom foreign aid and loans and surplus of government revenue over routine \nexpenditure.  The  development  expenditure,  however,  did  not  \nonly cover capital expenditure, as it also included routine and operational \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 601  A. Nasution \n \nexpenditure such as travel expenses and honorarium received by those \ndirectly involved in development activities \n(ii)  Replace  the  antiquated  cash-based,  single-entry  bookkeeping  of  the \nIndonesian Treasury Law (Indische Comtabilitetwet), Statute Book No 443 \nof  1925,  inherited  from  the  colonial  past  with  a  double  entry,  accrual \naccounting system, and performance-related multiyear budgets.  \n(iii)  Apply an integrated and computerized accounting system.  \n(iv)  Decentralize  the  accounting  implementation  in  a  hierarchical  manner  to \neach accounting unit both at the central and regional levels.  \n(v)  Gradually  adopt  a  single  treasury  account.  In  the  past,  accounts  were \ndivided into many accounts, including the personal accounts of government \nofficials.  \n(vi)  Use a tight time framework for the accountability report. The new system is \ntherefore required to establish standard budgeting, auditing, and reporting \nprocedures for all local budgets; and mechanisms to monitor the sharing of \nnatural resources revenue and transfers. The new system demands the \nestablishment of an independent treasury and payment systems. The old \nsystem,  by  contrast,  did  not  need  an  independent  treasury  as  most \nfinancing  was  done  through  special  purpose  grants  administered  by \ncentrally appointed officials. As mentioned earlier, in addition to the financial \naudit, the BPK will also carry out a performance and compliance audit.  \nAs noted above, the new audit law expanded the traditional financial audit to include a \nperformance and compliance audit. The financial audit includes financial statements, \naccounting, receipts, and related financial matters. The objective of this audit is to \nassess the internal control system to ensure the quality of accounting information and \nfinancial reporting. The compliance audit evaluates how well the organization complies \nwith and adheres to relevant policies, laws, directions, plans, and procedures. The \nobjective of a performance audit is to evaluate and review the effectiveness, efficiency, \nand economic results of the government activities (Baltaci and Yilmaz 2007). \nFor various reasons, the shift toward the new fiscal system occurred very slowly. The \nfirst reason is because the standardized types, format, and structure of the government \nfinance and state financial reports are still in the making. Second, measurable standard \nperformance indicators for government applicable to the whole country need to be set \nup by the central government. With this data, the central government is able to monitor \nthe financial transactions of subnational governments. Third, it takes time to adopt the \nsingle treasury account. Fourth, implementation of a double-entry accounting, accrual, \nand performance-based system and a multiyear budget is very slow. This is because \nthe single accounting system for all local government and public entities is not yet \navailable. Moreover, these new changes demand highly educated and well-trained \naccounting personnel, which are not yet available at government agencies and public \nentities.  Fifth,  non-budgetary  funds  and  quasi-fiscal  activities  have  not  yet  been \nincorporated  into  the  state  budget.  Many  government  agencies  have  their  own \nbusiness entities and extra budgetary funds, which they inherited from the past. Sixth, \nthe roles and responsibilities of state institutions have not yet been clarified at all levels. \nSeventh, the legal status of many of the state assets is not clear yet. Until now, there \nhave  been  no  comprehensive  centralized  accounting  records  of  the  government\u2019s \nphysical assets such as land holdings, infrastructure, buildings, plants and equipment, \nand capital stocks and stores. \n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 601  A. Nasution \n \n3.  FINANCING SUBNATIONAL GOVERNMENTS \nThe districts and municipalities are given more financial resources to carry out their \ngreater responsibilities. This is because the main thrust of the decentralization program \nhas been to devolve expenditure responsibilities. The subnational governments have \nlimited freedom to set tax rates such as land and building tax and motor vehicle tax and \ntheir transfer tax. Borrowing powers of subnational governments are strictly controlled. \nCentral government controls wage and salary rates for local government employees. \n3.1  Revenues of Local Governments \nAs pointed above, at present, tax capacity and the effort of subnational governments to \ncollect tax revenue is irrelevant as they are only given a very low tax base and no \npower to collect major taxes. At present, tax bases of regional governments are limited \nto minor taxes (Table 3). Effective from 1 January 2010, Law No. 28/1999 transferred \nthe  authority  to  collect  land  and  building  taxes  from  the  central  government  to \nsubnational governments. Prior to that, taxes were collected by the central government \nand  returned  mostly  to  district  governments  and  municipalities  after  deducting \ncollection  costs.  Most  of  the  tax  bases,  such  as  motor  vehicles  and  high  value \nresidential and office buildings, are located in big cities, but not much in the rural areas \nwith sparse populations and less commercial activity. Hotel, restaurant, entertainment, \nand street lighting taxes are also more relevant to big cities and tourist areas such as \nYogyakarta  and  Bali.  Annual  assessment  of  the  tax  bases,  particularly  land  and \nbuilding taxes in a big and diverse country such as Indonesia, is costly. The Directorate \nGeneral of Taxation of the Ministry of Finance provides benchmarks for each province. \nThe standard tax rate for a given base is also difficult to calculate for each region given \ntheir great diversity. \nTable 3: Regional Taxes \nType of tax  Assignment  Tax base  Tax rate (%)  Sharing \nMotor vehicles  Province  Vehicle value (annual)  5  30% to local \ngovernments \nMotor vehicle  Province  Vehicle resale price (annual)  10  30% to local \ntransfer tax  governments \nFuel excise tax  Province  Fuel consumption (retail  5  70% to local \nprice, excluding VAT)  governments \nUtilization of water  Province  Water consumption  20  70% to local \ngovernments \nHotel tax  Local  Turnover  10   \nRestaurant tax  Local  Turnover  10   \nEntertainment tax  Local  Turnover (admission price)  35   \nStreet lighting tax  Local  Electricity consumption (retail  10   \nprice, excluding VAT) \nMining tax for  Local  Market value of extracted  20   \nClass C minerals*  minerals \nParking tax  Local  Parking fees  20   \nNotes: VAT = value-added tax. \n* Class C minerals include asbestos, slate, semiprecious stone, limestone, pumice, precious stone, bentonite, dolomite, \nfeldspars, halites, graphite, granite and andesite, gypsum, calcite, kaolin, leucite, magnesium, mica, marble, nitrate, \nobsidian, ocher, sand and gravel, quartz sand, perlite, phosphate, talc, fuller\u2019s earth, diatom soil, clay, alum, trass, \nyarosite, zeolite, basalt, and tracite. \nSource: Law No. 34/2000.  \n12 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 601  A. Nasution \n \nThe motor vehicle tax is an annual tax on the value of the vehicle. Motor vehicle \ntransfer tax, the largest source of provincial tax revenue in major provinces such as \nJakarta and other big cities on Java, Medan, and Makassar, is levied at the time of \nresale  of  a  motor  vehicle.  At  present,  the  tax  rate  is  1.5%.  For  both  taxes,  the \ndetermination of the value is set periodically by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) \nand made available to provincial governments who then collect the tax. The provincial \ngovernment  collects  fuel  tax  at  5%,  and  the  revenue  is  shared  with  district \ngovernments.  \nLaw No. 34/2000 gives rights to local governments to impose local taxes as long as \nthose taxes do not impose high costs on the economy or restrict mobility of factors of \nproduction as well as goods and services across regions and constrain international \ntrade. Specifically, the new taxes should meet the following eight criteria: (i) they are \ntaxes and not user charges, (ii) the tax base is located locally in the region and is \nimmobile, (iii) the taxes do not conflict with public interest, (iv) the tax base is not \nsubject  to  provincial  and  national  taxation,  (v)  the  revenue  potential  is  adequate, \n(vi) the taxes do not exert economic distortions, (vii) equity concerns are taken into \naccount,  and  (viii)  environmental  sustainability  is  taken  into  account.  The  local \ngovernments also raise revenue from license fees from small operators of mines and \nplantations operating in their jurisdictions. The laws on mining and plantation give the \ndistricts power to issue such licenses. Licenses for big operators are issued by the \ncentral government, and the subnational governments receive royalties from them.   \nFiscal Balance Law No. 25/1999 introduced special revenue sharing for oil and gas. \nThis  law  creates  further  imbalances  between  regions  due  to  concentration  of  the \nproduction of oil and gas in a few producing provinces and kabupaten. The main oil-\nproducing provinces are Riau, East Kalimantan, Ambon, West Papua, Aceh, and East \nJava. The law assigns 15% of nontax revenue from onshore oil to local governments, \n3% of which goes to the producing province, 6% to the producing district, and 6% is to \nbe shared by nonproducing districts in the producing region. For onshore gas, 30% of \nthe nontax revenue is to be shared, 6% goes to the producing province, 12% to the \nproducing district, and 12% to nonproducing districts in the producing province.1 This \nformulation is quite opaque, further complicated by the inclusion of offshore oil within \n12  miles.  The  nonproducing  provinces  may  also  need  to  be  compensated  by  an \n\u201cequalization\u201d transfer system that reduces the interregional disparities created by the \noil- and gas-sharing formula. The revenue-sharing arrangement has become more \ncomplicated with the volatility in international prices of oil and gas that rapidly changed \nthe realized revenue or the tax base for oil sharing. \nTo redress the grievances of the resource-rich regions, Law No. 33/2004 gives some \nportions of the personal income taxes and taxes on natural resources to the originating \nprovinces and districts (Table 4). The DBH (Dana Bagi Hasil) or revenue or tax sharing \nfrom the general tax resources and revenue from extraction of natural endowments \ninclude mining, oil and gas, forestry, fishery, and geothermal. \nTo end the secessionist armed rebellions in the provinces of Aceh and Papua, the \ngovernment  gave  them  more  political  autonomy,  special  local  treatment,  special \nintergovernmental transfer treatment, and higher rates of revenue sharing from natural \nresources (Table 5). They are allowed to establish local political parties. Aceh has been \nallowed to adopt Islamic Syariah law, a council of Moslem scholars, and Islamic courts. \nPapua receives special additional allocations of funds amounting to 2% of DAU for \nproducing public services.  \n                                                \n1  The Law does not specify the method for distributing the 6% oil revenue and 12% gas revenue to  \nnonproducing districts. \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 601  A.

Nasution \n \n3.2  Expenditure Needs of Local Governments \nThe expenditure needs of local governments are estimated by using the most important \nneeds of a regional government. Each regional government has five main categories of \nexpenditure  needs:  (i)  education;  (ii)  health  and  social  welfare;  (iii)  government \nadministration; (iv) infrastructure and public works; and (v) economic development, \nincluding  transport,  agriculture,  industry  and  trade,  capital  investment,  land, \ncooperatives, labor force, and environment. The expenditure needs for education are \nestimated  by  the  number  of  school-age  children  and  average  years  \nof education. At present, it is compulsory for children to finish 9 years of schooling. \nExpenditure  for  health  and  social  welfare  is  calculated  by  using  information  on \npopulation numbers, the proportion of the old-age population, average life expectancy, \nand infant mortality. The government provides free medical services and contraception \nfor its birth control program to control population growth. The needs of the general \ngovernment administration are estimated from population numbers and the percentage \nof urban population. The expenses for infrastructure are estimated using the length of \nlocal roads, the share of poor roads in the total length of local roads, and population \ndensity. The expenditure needs for economic development, including for agriculture, \ntrade, industry, and telecommunications are calculated based on population numbers, \nper capita GDP, and a poverty head count ratio.  \nUnder  the  centralized  system  of  the  past,  the  minimum  standards  for  the  public \nservices were set by the central government. Local government workers, such as \nteachers,  medical  workers,  workers  building  and  maintaining  infrastructure,  and \nagriculture extension services workers, were assigned by the central government to the \nregion. In a large and diverse country like Indonesia, the cost of producing public \nservices greatly varies from one region to another. Because of the transfer of civil \nservants to the jurisdiction of local governments, local budgets are heavily skewed \ntoward  operating  expenditure,  particularly  to  cover  personnel  expenses  including \nsalaries of teachers, and personnel in health care and public works. This reduces  \nthe budget for maintenance and rehabilitation of infrastructure, school buildings, and \nmedical equipment.  \nUnder the local autonomy program, public services must be provided by staff employed \nby  local  governments.  It  is  not  easy  to  transfer  the  civil  servants  of  the  central \ngovernment to lower-level administrations. There are many reasons for this, including \nthe  reluctance  of  civil  servants  to  move  to  other  districts  with  different  ethnic \nbackgrounds, with which they have few ties, and with fewer amenities. Because of \nthese  problems,  the  central  government  continues  to  finance  all  civil  servants\u2019 \nexpenditure even if they work for local governments. The quality of spending is limited \nby the inadequacy of qualified teachers, health workers, and technicians to produce the \npublic goods and financial managers to manage the state funds. \n3.3  Horizontal Imbalances of Regional Government \nAs  noted  above,  there  are  vast  differences  in  the  geographic  and  socioeconomic \ncharacteristics of local governments. About two-thirds of the population of Indonesia \nlives  on  Java,  one  of  the  most  populous  islands  on  earth.  Provinces  with  big \npopulations (West Java, East Java, Central Java, and Banten) are located on Java. \nJava was strongly controlled by the Dutch and British colonialists. They built vast \ntransportation networks for military and trading purposes. They developed modern \ncommercial agricultural plantations and mining on Java. Sumatra has the second- \nbiggest  population,  and  most  modern  commercial  plantations  are  located  in  North \n15 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 601  A. Nasution \n \nSumatra.  Oil and gas are extracted in Aceh, Riau, and South Sumatra. Tin bauxite \nmines are developed in Bangka Belitung along the strategic Malacca Straits. Makassar, \nat the southern tip of Sulawesi, is strategically located to control the spice trade from \nthe Eastern part of Indonesia and strategic Sulawesi Straits to East Asia. West Papua \nis  the  biggest  island  in  Indonesia,  followed  by  Kalimantan,  but  they  are  sparsely \npopulated and relatively less developed in terms of transportation. These two islands \nare rich in natural resources: minerals and metals, as well as forest products. \nIndonesia also has widely diverging levels of Regional Gross Development Product \n(RGDP), and diverse economic structure, natural resource endowment, and stages of \nindustrialization. The regions have diverse capacities to raise revenues from their own \nsources and revenue-sharing arrangements. The regional GDP per capita of the richest \noil- and gas-producing region among the districts is $334,759 (in Bontang), which is \nmore than 16,230 times higher than that of the poorest in district Nusa Tenggara Timur \n($208) with poor natural resources. The provinces on Java are the centers for the \nmanufacturing industries as well as labor-intensive handicrafts and small and medium-\nsized enterprises with very low marginal productivity of labor. Java and South Sulawesi \nare rice-producing areas.  \nPapua, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Sumatra are the centers of mining, forestry, and \nagricultural industries dominated by large companies and subject to cyclical shocks. PT \nFreeport Indonesia, which has mined copper and gold in the rugged Estberg area since \n1966, contributed over 50% of Papua\u2019s economy and 90% of its total exports. Over \n42% of West Papua\u2019s GDP is contributed by the LPG project in Bintuni area operated \nby BP Indonesia. East Kalimantan\u2019s economy is dependent on the LNG Project in \nBontang, coal mining, and forestry. Meanwhile, Sumatra, Java and Kalimantan are \nhome  to  modern  commercial  plantations.  The  benefits  of  mining  and  plantation \nbusinesses for local communities in terms of value-added are, however, relatively small \nas they are either capital-intensive or knowledge-based industries that directly export \nunprocessed raw materials. Skilled technical workers are imported from either Java or \noverseas. \nThere are also large disparities in living conditions. Indonesia\u2019s economy, particularly \non Java, Madura, and Bali Island, is a labor surplus economy with very low marginal \nproductivity because of low levels of education and minimal skills. The poverty rate \nranges from about 7% in the industrial district of Bekasi, close to Jakarta the capital \ncity, to more than 40% in West Sumba in West Nusa Tenggara. The illiteracy rate in \nSampang, Madura Island in East Java is more than 21% though it has fallen to 9% for \nIndonesia as a whole. Being devout Moslems, the Maduranese are well versed in the \nArabic alphabet. Secondary school gross enrollment in the poorest districts is only nine \nstudents as compared with 125 students in richer areas. Life expectancy in the poorest \ndistrict is 57.5 years, which is far below the national average of 66.3 years, and 73.7 \nyears  for  the  richest  areas.  About  98%  of  people  in  Tanjung  Jabung,  \nJambi, have access to primary health care, but only about 21% do in Sintang, West \nKalimantan. In 2013, the highest unemployment rate was registered in Aceh (10.30%), \nfollowed by Banten (9.90%), the Moluccas (9.75%), West Java (9.22%), and Jakarta \n(9.02%). The  lowest  unemployment  rates  during that  year  were  registered  in  Bali \n(1.79%), West Sulawesi (2.33%), and Yogyakarta (3.34%). \nThe disparity in public service also indicates disparity in both the cost of tax collection \nand the cost of public sector service delivery. Some cities and districts in big provinces \nhave large jurisdictions but sparse populations, such as the City of Sabang at the \nnorthern tip of Sumatra with a population of almost 4 million. For this reason, it cannot \nmeet the threshold for economies of scale to deliver services efficiently. But some local \n16 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 601  A. Nasution \n \ngovernments are too large in relation to their populations, such as the cities of Jakarta, \nBandung, and Surabaya. \n3.4  Equalization Transfer  \nIn principle, the equalization transfer (Dana Perimbangan [TRA]) is made available to \nsupplement own revenue and to finance local service provision (as defined by the \ncentral government) that does not affect neighboring jurisdictions. At present, there are \nthree grant arrangements for subnational governments in Indonesia that replace the \nInpres programs of the past: General Revenue Grants (Dana Alokasi Umum [DAU]), \nEqualization  Grants  (Dana  Bagi  Hasil  [DBH]),  and  Special  Purpose  Grants  (Dana \nAlokasi  Khusus  [DAK]).The  general  grants  should  be  made  available  to  cover  \nthe  recurrent  needs  of  the  subnational  governments  and  their  working  capital \nrequirements. At present, there are no transfers to address regional inequalities or \neconomic growth in less developed regions. \nEckardt  and  Shah  (2006)  identified  five  main  reasons  for  grants  from  the  central \ngovernment to lower levels of government:  \n2\n(i)  correct for inefficiencies arising from inter-jurisdictional spillovers;   \n(ii)  address fiscal gaps or imbalances arising from a mismatch between the \nrevenue and expenditure of local governments; \n(iii)  ensure common minimum service standards for all regions;  \n(iv)  narrow the difference in tax base as well as the cost of delivery of public \nservice between regions; and  \n(v)  stabilize the economy by increasing grants in periods of slack economic \nactivity and contain expenditure during upswings in the economic cycle.  \nFor a number of reasons, the real allocation of grants can deviate from the Equalization \nTransfer formula. The reasons include political considerations and lobbying by local \ngovernment  associations.  The  provinces  of  Aceh  and  Papua  are  given  special \ntreatment because of the combination of strong secessionist movements and their \nbackwardness,  and  higher  costs  of  service  delivery.  In  addition,  the  Transfer \nEqualization  formula  has  not  been  fully  implemented  partly  because  the  central \ngovernment continues to finance all civil service expenditures that should be totally \ntransferred  to  the  subnational  governments.  The  distribution  of  teachers,  health \nworkers, and public sector workers, who build and maintain infrastructure and other \npublicly produced goods, is uneven between regions. The production cost of public \nservices also varies greatly between regions. \n3.5  Budget Realization  \nTable 6 shows the realization of budgets of provincial and local governments between \n2001 and 2013. In 2013, 74.44% of the budget of local governments belonged to \ndistricts and municipalities and only 25.56% was owned by the provinces. Transfers \nfrom the central government are the main source of revenue for provinces as well as \ndistricts and municipalities. Extraction of financial transfers from the central government \nis one of the motives for the creation of new government units by provinces, districts, \nmunicipalities, sub-districts, or villages. In 2001, transfers from the central government \n                                                \n2\n  Spillovers occur because benefits of locally provided goods or services (such as pollution control) spill \nbeyond the local jurisdiction to benefit those not contributing to the costs. \n17 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 601  A. Nasution \n \naccounted for  57%  of revenue  of  provincial  governments  and  90%  of  revenue  of \ndistricts and municipalities. The share of own revenue in total revenue for provincial \ngovernments,  as  well  as  districts  and  municipalities,  rose  significantly  after  the \nintroduction of tax and revenue sharing in 2004.  \nTable 7 shows the breakdown of own source of revenue for provinces and districts and \nmunicipalities.  User  charges,  profits  of  government-owned  enterprises,  and  other \nrevenue are more relevant for districts and municipalities than for provinces. \n \nTable 6: Sources of Revenue and Expenditure of Provincial Government  \nand District/Municipality, 2001\u20132013 \nLocal \nProvinces  Governments \nYear  (%)  (%) \n% of Total Revenue         \nOwn-Source Revenue-  200 1  39  7 \nIntergovernmental Transfer (Dana Perimbangan)  2001  57  90 \nAdjustment and Special Autonomy Fund  2001  1  0 \nOther Revenue  2001  3  3 \n% of Total Expenditure \nRoutine Expenditure  200 1  64   69  \nCapital Expenditure  2001  36  31 \n% of Total Revenue \nOwn-Source Revenue  201 0  49   7  \nIntergovernmental Transfer (Dana Perimbangan)  2010  42  77 \nAdjustment and Special Autonomy Fund  2010  9  7 \nOther Revenue  2010  1  8 \n% of Total Expenditure \nRoutine Expenditure  201 0  73   79  \nCapital Expenditure  2010  27  21 \n% of Total Revenue       \nOwn-Source Revenue  201 3  50  11 \nIntergovernmental Transfer (Dana Perimbangan)  2013  31  72 \nAdjustment and Special Autonomy Fund  2013  18  9 \nOther Revenue  2013  1  8 \n% of Total Expenditure \nRoutine Expenditure  201 3  79   72  \nCapital Expenditure  2013  20  28 \nSources: Directorate General for Fiscal Balances, The Ministry of Finance.

This is mainly due to the transfer of civil servants \nto local governments to implement the decentralization program. At present, over 70% \nof the budget of local governments is allocated to pay for the salaries of civil servants. \nThe  largest  share  of  capital  expenditure  of  the  local  governments  has  been  for \npurchasing goods and services. \nThe number of provinces with budget deficits decreased from 22 in 2009 to 11 in 2011, \nbut  increased  to  15  in  2013.  The  number  of  provinces  with  budget  surpluses  \nwas 11 in 2009, 22 in 2011, and 18 in 2013. The number of districts and municipalities \nwith budget deficits fell from 281 in 2009 to 87 in 2011, but increased to 139 in 2013. \nThe number of district and municipalities with budget surpluses rose from 196 in 2009  \nto  404  in  2011,  and  fell  to  352  in  2013.  To  restore  the  solvency  of  some  local \ngovernments, their budget deficits were financed by emergency funds from the central \ngovernment. The high number of subnational governments with budget deficits shows \nthe presence of the soft budget constraint, which allows them to increase expenditure \nwithout eventually having to bear the full costs, as ultimately budget deficits were \ncleared by the central government. \n4.  CONCLUSIONS \nWithout much preparation, Laws No. 22/1999 and No. 25/1999 abruptly transferred \nresponsibilities for the delivery of 11 obligatory functions from the central government \nto districts and municipalities, bypassing the provincial governments. Unlike in many \nemerging and transitioning countries, the decentralization program in Indonesia was \nimplemented quickly without any major political or economic problems. Only the former \nProvince of East Timor seceded to establish the Republic of Timor-Leste in 1989. To \nend the sporadic armed rebellious independent movements, Aceh and Papua were \ngranted with special autonomy in dealing with local customs, education, religion and \nlocal development policy. \n19 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 601  A. Nasution \n \nThe  rapid  rise  in  the  expenditure  of  subnational  governments  that  came  with \ndecentralization did not carry serious fiscal risks at the national level nor a breakdown \nin public sector delivery. Neither has the growth of subnational spending on public \nservices and capital investments (in health, education, basic infrastructure, and other \nobligatory functions) so far posed a major threat to macroeconomic stability. At present, \nno subnational government has floated bonds to diversify their funding needs or to \nattract the financing required for investment in infrastructure. However, after over 15 \nyears of reform, institutions have yet to be built to allow both the provincial and sub-\nprovincial governments to implement the newly acquired responsibilities.  \nSubnational  governments  have  different  capabilities  to  deliver  public  services  \nin education, health care, infrastructure, and other areas. They also have different \ncapabilities in managing their finances and raising revenue, and different tax bases. \nThe central government can supervise the subnational governments through setting \nnational standards for public services applicable throughout the country. The central \ngovernment can also supervise the subnational governments through a unified system \nof financial accounts, audit rules, disclosure requirements, and financial auditing. The \ncombination  of  the  absence  of  unified  public  service  standards  and  the  lack  of \nknowledge in the new administration of public funds has led to corruption and delays in \nthe disbursement of government budget expenditure. The political system needs to be \nimproved to make the elected governors, mayors, and heads of districts accountable to \nthe community through regular elections, and not to their political parties. \nThe central government remains substantially in control of local governments through \ncontrolling their budgets, through auditing local governments (compliance, financial, \nand performance audit), and rotation of civil servants and senior officials between \nprovinces and sub-provinces.  \nTaxing capacities and expenditure decisions of local governments also remain very \nweak. At present, none of the subnational governments has floated local currency \nbonds to diversify funding and attract the financing required for long-term investment in \ninfrastructure. The responsibility for taxing and expenditure decisions should lie with \nthe  authority  that  is  in  the  best  position  to  evaluate  the  alternatives  available. \nSubnational governments should have the information that will enable them to balance \nneeds as reflected in expenditure proposals against the sacrifices that must be made to \nsatisfy those needs. The capabilities of local governments also need to be upgraded in \nthe planning of economic development to promote economic growth and to address \nregional inequalities by promoting private sector investment and exports.  \nThe  reform  has  given  larger  financial  resources  to  subnational  governments  and \ngreater freedom on budget expenditure. So far, over 40% of government expenditure of \nthe central government has been transferred to subnational governments. However, \nthe basic issues in fiscal federalism have not been answered. Who should do what to \nmake expenditure assignment more specific? The revenue assignment should answer \nthe question of who should levy tax. How to resolve vertical imbalance to resolve the \nimbalance between revenue and expenditure of districts and municipalities? How to \naddress the horizontal imbalance or equalization due to the difference in needs as  \nwell as the capacity of districts and municipalities to raise revenue and produce the \nsame standards of service? How to maintain fiscal discipline to avoid overspending by  \nthe  subnational  governments?  How  to  regulate  internal  and  external  borrowing  of \nsubnational governments for financing their budgets? \n \n   \n20 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 601  A.
