These replace the former Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) and Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). The procurement policy and the \nprocurement regulations address the procurement activities of project executing \nagencies and implementing agencies on projects financed in whole or in part by a \nloan or grant from ADB, or by ADB-administered funds. ADB designed the 2017 \nprocurement policy to deliver significant benefits and flexibility throughout the \nproject procurement cycle, as well as to improve project delivery through a renewed \nfocus on the concepts of quality, value for money (VFM), and fitness for purpose.\n\nThis note is part of a series of guidance notes published by ADB in 2018 to \naccompany the 2017 procurement policy and the procurement regulations. \nEach\u00a0note discusses a topical issue for borrowers (including grant recipients), \nbidders, and civil society under the new framework (see list below). The guidance \nnotes cross-reference each other frequently and should be read in conjunction. \nAll\u00a0references to \u201cguidance notes\u201d pertain to these notes.

VFM is part of a holistic procurement structure \nwith three support pillars: efficiency, quality, and flexibility. The two key principles of \ntransparency and fairness weave across all elements of the structure.\n\nt r a n sparency\n\nValue for Money\nThe effective, efficient, and economic use of resources,  \nwhich requires an evaluation of relevant costs and benefits along  \nwith an assessment of risks, nonprice attributes, and/or total cost  \nof ownership as appropriate\n\nefficiency\n\nQuality\n\nFlexibility\n\n\u2022\tDecreased transaction \n\n\u2022\tContract management \n\n\u2022\tOpen competitive \n\ncosts\n\nsupport\n\n\u2022\tIncreased skills\n\u2022\tIncreased high-level \ntechnology usage\n\n\u2022\tImproved \n\nprocurement planning\n\n\u2022\tPrompt resolution of \n\ncomplaints\n\n\u2022\tImproved developing \n\nmember country \nprocurement process \n\n\u2022\tSupport and \n\n\u2022\tImproved \n\nencouragement \nof e-procurement \nsystems\n\nprocurement planning\n\n\u2022\tGovernance\n\u2022\tContracts with clear \nperformance criteria\n\u2022\tMinimal number of \n\ncomplaints\n\n\u2022\tImproved ADB \n\nprocesses \n\nFairnes s\n\nbidding\n\n\u2022\tDecentralization\n\u2022\tAccreditation \nfor alternative \nprocurement \narrangements\n\u2022\tPrinciples-based \n\ndecisions\n\u2022\tImproved \n\nprocurement planning\n\n\u2022\tDelegation\n\u2022\tBids with weighted  \n\nproposal  \ncriteria \n\ntime\n\nTime is an important element of VFM. When a project is delivered promptly or when a \nprocess is completed rapidly, greater value is created for all stakeholders. For example, a \nroad project completed early provides economic benefit, security, or other value to the \ncommunity it serves. It increases the return on investment to the executing agency and \naccelerates the project and payment cycle to the successful bidder. Likewise, a project \ndelivered late loses significant value. \n\nWhen considering VFM in the context of procurement, pay attention to anything \nthat (i)\u00a0shortens the procurement cycle time frame or (ii) accelerates delivery of the \ndevelopment project.\n\n\fAbout This Publication\n\nvii\n\nobjective\n\nThis guidance note is intended to assist readers by elaborating on and explaining  \nADB\u2019s 2017\u00a0procurement policy and procurement regulations for borrowers \n(including grant\u00a0recipients). \n\nThis note identifies additional information for the reader to consider when applying ADB\u2019s \nprocurement policy and procurement regulations to their circumstances. \n\nliving document\n\nThis guidance note is intended to be a living document and will be revised as required.\n\nBe sure to check the ADB Business Center website for the latest version and updates,  \nhttps://www.adb.org/business/main.\n\nthe reader \n\nIn many circumstances, readers are expected to use this guidance note in a manner unique \nto their needs. For consistency throughout the suite of guidance notes, the following \nassumption is made about the reader:\n\nThe reader is a professional involved in activities financed in whole or in part by an ADB loan \nor grant, or by ADB-administered funds. \n\nFaQs\n\nFrequently asked questions, clarifications, examples, additional information, links to training, \nand other useful resources will be made available on the ADB website. \n\nBe sure to check the ADB Business Center website for more information,  \nhttps://www.adb.org/business/main.\n\nlegal and order of Priority\n\nThis guidance note explains and elaborates on the provisions of the Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers: Goods, Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting Services \n(2017, as amended from time to time) applicable to executing (and implementing) agencies \nunder sovereign (including subsovereign) projects financed in whole or in part by an \ninvestment loan from ADB (i.e., excluding ADB results- or policy-based loans),  \nADB-financed grant (excluding ADB-administered technical assistance and staff \nconsultancies), or by ADB-administered funds. \n\nIn the event of any discrepancy between this guidance note and the procurement \nregulations, the latter will prevail. The financing agreement governs the legal relationships \nbetween the borrower and ADB. The rights and obligations between the borrower and the \nprovider of goods, works, or services are governed by the specific procurement document \nissued by the borrower and by the contract signed between the borrower and the provider, \nand not by this guidance note.\n\n\fviii\n\nabbreViations\n\nADB \n\nIFP \n\nPQD \n\nPQER \n\nSPQD \n\nVFM \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\nAsian Development Bank\n\nInvitation for Prequalification\n\nprequalification document\n\nPrequalification Evaluation Report\n\n Standard Procurement Document for \nPrequalification of Bidders \n\nvalue for money\n\n\fexeCutiVe suMMary\n\nix\n\nThis guidance note demonstrates the benefits of using a robust prequalification \nprocess and shows how it may be applied in ADB operations. It distinguishes \nbetween work required during the prequalification and bidding phases of the \nprocurement cycle. During the prequalification phase, the borrower (or grant \nrecipient) assesses the suitability of an applicant to work on a project before inviting \nthem to submit a bid.\n\nThe following features are new to the prequalification process:\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nthe ability to limit the number of qualified applicants that are invited to bid \nand \ncriteria for historical contract nonperformance. \n\nA robust prequalification exercise may \n\nIncrease Efficiency and Reduce Procurement Time\n\nEnsures that only applicants who meet the requirements of the project\u2014\nincluding experience and capability\u2014are invited to submit bids, while at the \nsame time allowing for healthy competition.\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nEnsure Quality\n\nThe ability to limit the number of qualified applicants invited to bid (new \nin this guidance note) leads to higher quality outcomes by reducing the \nnumber of bidders to a manageable number of the most qualified applicants.\n\nReduce Risk and Improve Value for Money\n\n\u2022\t\n\nThe provisions for handling historical contract nonperformance among \nbidders reduce risk and improve value for money.\n\n\f\fi.\u2003introduction\n\nThis guidance note is intended to provide clarity on the circumstances \n\n1.1 \nwhere it is appropriate to conduct prequalification\u2014and the process to be \nfollowed\u2014in projects financed in whole or in part by a loan or grant from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), or by ADB-administered funds. The Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers: Goods, Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting \nServices (2017, as amended from time to time) include prequalification as a \nmechanism intended to ensure that only those applicants that have adequate \ncapabilities and resources submit bids for the supply of goods, works, and services.\n\nPrequalification is a process associated with open competitive bidding \n\n1.2 \nwherein the borrower (or grant recipient) assesses the suitability of applicants \nto carry out a specific contract before inviting them to submit bids. Generally, \nall\u00a0applicants that meet the minimum prequalification criteria are invited to bid. \nThere are situations where the number of successfully prequalified applicants \ninvited to submit bids may be limited (section III of this guidance note).\n\n1.3 \nconcentrates on the technical and financial aspects of specific bids.\n\nThe prequalification process is distinct from the bid process\u2014which \n\n1.4 \nThe prequalification procedure described in this guidance note applies \nto the procurement of (i) goods; (ii) large and complex works; (iii)  plant: design, \nsupply, and install; and (iv) design-and-build projects, among others, requiring \nbidders (or a group of bidders) who are suitably experienced in the type of work and \nconstruction technology involved in the contract to demonstrate their capacity.\n\n1.5 \nIn the case of consulting services, prequalification is included in the \ncontext of the process of shortlisting firms and is considered in the Guidance \nNote on Consulting Services Administered by ADB Borrowers. Prequalification of \nnonconsulting services is considered in the Guidance Note on Nonconsulting Services \nAdministered by ADB Borrowers.\n\n1.6 \nThe prequalification process is optional and should be used on a \u201cfit-for-\npurpose\u201d basis, i.e., where the nature and complexity of the contract are such that \nthe value of prequalification would create in the procurement process exceeds \nthe costs and its associated risks.

However, the 2017 procurement regulations \n(in Appendix\u00a03, para. 19) allow the borrower to limit the number of prequalified \napplicants to be invited to bid for the contract, provided\n\n(i)  any criteria used to limit the number of prequalified applicants to be \ninvited to bid are stated in the prequalification documents, and \n\n(ii)  doing this does not limit fair competition. \n\n3.3 \nused sparingly and only in the following circumstances:\n\nLimiting the number of prequalified applicants invited to bid should be \n\n(i)  Where the strategic procurement planning suggests that the executing \nagency has capacity to administer the process effectively (refer to the \nGuidance Note on Strategic Procurement Planning). \n\n(ii)  Where the relevant expertise cannot be identified from the standard \nprequalification criteria, e.g., in projects that are highly specialized or \ninvolve high-level technology (refer to the Guidance Note on High-\nLevel Technology).\n\n(iii)  Where the means of delivering the project outcomes require \n\ninnovation, or the project outcomes can be delivered in different ways.\n(iv)  Where the market assessment suggests there may be a large number \n\nof applicants that are likely to be prequalified. \n\nLimiting the number of prequalified applicants invited to bid is achieved \n\n3.4 \nby using \u201cscorable\u201d prequalification criteria. These are criteria related to the special \nrequirements of the project that are scored against a predefined scoring scale so \nthat overall scores are calculated for each applicant for the purpose of comparison \nof their relative capabilities. The scored prequalification criteria are used in addition \nto the pass/fail prequalification criteria.\n\n\f6\n\nPrequalification\n\n3.5 \napplicants invited to bid:\n\nTwo methods can be used to reduce the number of prequalified \n\nthe minimum cut-off score methodology and\n\n(i) \n(ii)  the score ranking methodology. \n\nThe minimum cut-off score methodology involves setting a minimum \n\n3.6 \nscore against the scored prequalification criteria that applicants must meet to be \nprequalified. In this methodology, all applicants that have achieved the minimum \ncut-off score must be invited to bid.\n\nThe ranking methodology involves selecting the top scoring applicants \n\n3.7 \nto be invited to bid. The number of applicants to be invited to bid is required to be \nstated in the prequalification document.\n\nTo ensure that applicants invited to bid are of a suitable quality, the \n\n3.8 \nborrower may wish to combine the ranking and the minimum cut-off score \nmethodologies, stating in the prequalification document that a fixed number \n(or\u00a0range) of prequalified applicants will be invited to bid subject to meeting a \nspecified minimum cut-off score.\n\nThe choice of methodology used should be informed by the market \n\n3.9 \nassessment and the nature of the contract. For example, if the assessment \nshows a large number of applicants are likely to be prequalified, or the number of \napplicants likely to be prequalified is unknown, the ranking approach may be more \nsuitable. If capability of bidders is the primary consideration, a minimum cut-off \nscore may be more suitable (if limiting prequalified applicants is still considered \nappropriate in this circumstance). If the market assessment shows a small number \nof applicants, the use of prequalification may not be an appropriate option. Instead, \npostqualification should be used with the appropriate qualification criteria.\n\nAn example of a prequalification evaluation using pass/fail and scored \n\n3.10 \nprequalification criteria to limit bidders, using the minimum cut-off score \nmethodology, is shown in Figure 2.2 Note that the scored prequalification criteria \nand the scoring scale shown in the example are for illustration purposes only and \nwill vary depending on the nature of the contract, contract requirements, and the \nborrower\u2019s preferred scoring scale methodology.\n\nIn this example, a two-step evaluation process is used. In Step 1, \n3.11 \napplications are assessed against the standard pass/fail prequalification criteria and \nassessed as either \u201cpass\u201d or \u201cfail.\u201d In this example, Applicants C and D fail one or \nmore of the pass/fail criteria and, therefore, do not progress to the next stage of the \nevaluation.\n\n2  Note that, in this example, a minimum cut-off score of 80% was used.\n\n\fConsiderations When Using Prequalification\n\n7\n\nFigure 2: Example of the Use of Scored Criteria to Limit Bidders,  \nUsing the Minimum Score Method\n\nPrequalification\nEvaluation Criteria\n\nScoring \nMethod\n\nApplicant \nA\n\nApplicant \nB\n\nApplicant \nC\n\nApplicant \nD\n\nApplicant \nE\n\nApplicant \nF\n\nApplicant \nG\n\nStep 1: Pass/Fail Prequalification Criteria\n\nPass/Fail\n\nPass/Fail\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nFail\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass/Fail\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass/Fail\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nFail\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass/Fail\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass/Fail\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nFail\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass/Fail\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nStep 1 Result\n\nPass/Fail\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nFail\n\nFail\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nStep 2: Scored Prequalification Criteria (Used for limiting bidders.

This \ncalculation method implies equal weighting applied to each scored prequalification \ncriterion, but different weightings may be applied to reflect the relative importance of \nthe criteria.\n\n3.13 \nIn this example, a minimum cut-off score of 80% was set and \ndocumented in the prequalification document. Applicants A, F, and G meet the \nminimum score and so are selected to be invited to bid. Applicants B and E did not \nmeet the minimum score of 80% and so were not selected to be invited to bid.\n\nNote that similar criteria can be used as pass/fail criteria and scored \n\n3.14 \nprequalification criteria, if suitable. In the above example, one of the standard pass/\nfail criteria in Step 1 is Experience, expressed as a minimum number of contracts \nof a similar size and nature. The pass level may be three contracts of a similar size \nand nature in the past 5 years. A similar Experience criterion is used in Step 2 as a \nscored criterion, namely, \u201cNumber of successfully completed contracts of similar \nsize and nature in past 5 years in excess of the minimum requirement.\u201d Utilizing \n\n\fConsiderations When Using Prequalification\n\n9\n\na rating scale of 0 to 5, scores may be assigned based on the number of contracts \nthe\u00a0applicant has performed in excess of the minimum requirement as illustrated \nin\u00a0Table 2.\n\nTable 2: Example Evaluation Score Definitions  \nfor Scored Prequalification Criteria\n\nCriterion = Experience (Number of contracts performed in past 5 years in excess of the \nminimum requirement)\n\nEvaluation Score\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nNumber of contracts \nin excess of minimum \nrequirement  \n(i.e., in excess of three)\n\n0 \ncontracts\n\n2 \ncontracts\n\n4 \ncontracts\n\n6 \ncontracts\n\n8 \ncontracts\n\n10 or \nmore \ncontracts\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\nUsing this method, an applicant that has performed a total of five \n\n3.15 \ncontracts, passes the Experience criterion in Step 1 having met the minimum \nrequirement of three contracts, and is given an evaluation score of 1 in Step 2 \nbecause it has performed two contracts in excess of the minimum requirement \nof\u00a0three.\n\n3.16 \n\nScored evaluation criteria that may be used to limit bidders may include\n\n(i)  management capability,\n\n(a)  risk management processes and systems,\n(b)  knowledge management and continuous improvement,\n(c)  quality management system and quality assurance processes, and\n(d)  workplace health and safety management systems; \n\n(ii)  project methodology and capability,\n\n(a)  project management capability, and\n(b)  preliminary project methodology; \n\n(iii)  innovation and high-level technology capability,\n\n(a)  innovative solutions supporting project objectives, and\n(b)  experience in the use of the high-level technology. \n\n3.17 \nThe use of scored prequalification criteria carries with it the risk that \nsubjectivity may be introduced into the prequalification process. In the above \nexample, the scored criterion \u201crisk management processes and systems\u201d is difficult \nto evaluate with complete objectivity. A way of reducing subjectivity is to use \nquantifiable criteria (e.g., the number of contracts of similar size and nature). \nEven\u00a0so, there may be some subjectivity in the interpretation of applicant responses \nin determining scores and, therefore, sound professional judgment will be required \nduring the evaluation.\n\n\f10\n\nPrequalification\n\nAnother way to reduce subjectivity is to establish \u201cscore descriptors\u201d prior \n\n3.18 \nto issuance of prequalification documents, setting out evidence required to be \nprovided by applicants in support of the criteria at each score level. Table 2 shows \nan example of the use of score descriptors. Score descriptors are used to guide \nthe evaluation panel and should be included in the prequalification document. \nFor\u00a0more information on the use of score descriptors, refer to the Guidance Note \non\u00a0Quality. \n\n3.19  Where limiting the number of prequalified applicants invited to bid is to \nbe used, the prequalification documents shall specify\n\n(i) \n\nthe methodology to be used will be to limit bidders (i.e., minimum cut-\noff score method or ranking method);\n\n(ii)  where the minimum score methodology is to be used\u2014the minimum \n\ncut-off score;\n\n(iii)  where the ranking methodology is to be used\u2014the number of \n\napplicants to be invited to bid;\n\n(iv)  the criteria to be used for evaluation; and\n(v)  the method for applying the criteria, including relative weighting. \n\nIn the case of the ranking methodology, the number of selected bidders \n\n3.20 \nwill depend on the project but should balance the efficiencies gained from limiting \nthe number of bids to be evaluated against the potential benefits of having a \ngreater number of responses (i.e., improving the probability of receiving suitable \nbids, increasing competition).\n\n3.21 \n\nA summary of this subsection is provided in Box 2.\n\nbox 2\nlimiting Prequalified applicants invited to bid\n\u2022\t Limiting the number of successfully prequalified applicants that are invited to bid is \n\nallowed under the 2017 procurement regulations.\n\n\u2022\t It should be used sparingly\u2014only when the standard prequalification criteria are \n\nnot sufficient to identify suitable applicants or to reduce the number of prequalified \napplicants to a manageable level.\n\n\u2022\t Scored prequalification criteria should be used to limit the number of qualified bidders.\n\u2022\t Two methodologies can be employed to limit bidders: minimum cut-off score method \n\nand ranking method.\n\n\u2022\t Where limiting the number of prequalified applicants invited to bid is to be conducted, \n\nthe prequalification documents should specify\n\n \u203a\n \u203a\n \u203a\n \u203a\n \u203a\n\nthe criteria used to evaluate applicants,\nthe relative weighting of the criteria,\nthe methodology to be employed (minimum cut-off or ranking),\nthe minimum cut-off score (where the minimum score method is used), and\nthe number of bidders to be invited to bid (where ranking is used).\n\n\u2022\t The number of bidders to be selected should balance efficiency and competition.\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\n\fConsiderations When Using Prequalification\n\n11\n\nB.  \n\nTreatment of Multiple Contracts/Lots\n\n3.22 \nseparate \u201ccontracts/lots\u201d as per the following example:\n\nDepending on the nature of the project, the scope may be divided into \n\n(i)  Lot 1: Build road section A (60 kilometers [km]).\n(ii)  Lot 2: Build road section B (80 km). \n\nThe borrower may decide to conduct separate prequalification exercises \n\n3.23 \nfor each contract/lot, or for groups of contracts/lots (\u201cpackages\u201d). In the latter case, \ncontracts/lots should only be grouped into packages in the same prequalification \nexercise if such are of similar type, size, and scope. In the case of prequalification \nexercises involving multiple contracts/lots, applicants should be instructed in \nthe prequalification documents to indicate the contracts/lots for which they \nare\u00a0applying.\n\nIt should be noted that when prequalifying applicants using multiple \n\n3.24 \ncontracts/lots grouped into a package, the objective of the exercise is to determine \nwhether applicants qualify for each contract/lot in the package separately \nand whether the applicants have the capacity to perform all contracts/lots or \ncombinations of contracts/lots. In the example in Figure 3, applicants would be \nprequalified for Lot 1 and Lot 2 individually. No opinion would be given on whether \napplicants could perform Lots 1 and 2 combined. Aggregation of qualification \nrequirements is not done at the prequalification stage, but at the bid stage.\n\nFigure 3: Example of Prequalification Using Packages\n\nPrequali\ufb01cation for a Package Consisting of \u201cLot 1\u201d and \u201cLot 2\u201d\n\nLot\n\nDescription\n\nPrequali\ufb01cation Applications\n\nApplicant A\n\nApplicant B\n\nApplicant C\n\nApplicant D\n\nApplicant E\n\nLots for which applicant \nhas applied\n\nLot 1\nLot 2\n\nLot 1\nLot 2\n\nLot 1\nLot 2\n\nLot 1\n\nLot 2\n\nExperience pass/fail evaluation\n\nLot 1\n\nLot 2\n\nRoad \nSection A\n\nRoad \nSection B\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nFail\n\nPass\n\nPass\n\nFail\n\nDid not \napply\n\nDid not \napply\n\nPass\n\nKEY:\nPass = Passed quali\ufb01cation\nFail= Did not pass quali\ufb01cation\nDid not apply = Did not apply for lot\n\nLot 1: Road Section A = 60 kilometers of road construction, \nestimated value $30 million \nLot 2: Road Section B = 80 kilometers of road construction, \nestimated value $40 million\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\n\f12\n\nPrequalification\n\nIn this example, the package for which the prequalification process is \n\n3.25 \nconducted consists of Lot 1, Road section A, comprising 60 km of road construction \nwith estimated value of $30 million, and Lot 2, Road section B, comprising 80 km of \nroad construction with estimated value of $40 million.\n\nApplicants A, B, and C have applied for both Lot 1 and Lot 2. Applicant D \n\n3.26 \nhas indicated interest in Lot 1 only and Applicant E has indicated interest in Lot 2 \nonly.\n\nApplicants A and C pass the experience criteria for Lot 1 and Lot 2, \n\n3.27 \nmeaning that they have constructed roads of value equivalent to (or equivalent to \nsome specified percentage of) Lot 2, Road section B. Since they have passed the \nexperience criterion for Lot 2, they also pass the experience criterion for the smaller \nLot 1.\n\nApplicant B met the experience requirement for Lot 1, but did not qualify \n3.28 \nfor the higher value Lot 2. Applicant D applied for Lot 1 but failed to show evidence \nof past experience sufficient to perform Lot 1. Applicant E applied for Lot 2 only and \nhas provided evidence of past experience sufficient for it to pass the experience \ncriterion for Lot 2.\n\n3.29 \nApplicants should not be disqualified if they have not provided unique \ncontract experience for each lot (for example, three contracts for Lot 1 and three \ndifferent contracts for Lot 2). In the preceding example, if Applicant A submitted \nthree contracts for $40 million each in support of its application for Lot 2, it is \ndeemed to have also qualified for Lot 1, even though it did not submit three other \ncontracts of $30 million supporting its application for Lot 1.\n\nC.  \n\nTreatment of Subcontractors\n\n3.30 \nThe prequalification of subcontractors should generally be avoided \nat the prequalification stage, because it may lock applicants into subcontract \narrangements without the ability to change at the time of bidding. Instead, \nsubcontractors\u2019 capabilities should be assessed during the bid. However, \nif\u00a0the nature of the project and key activities are such that prequalification of \nsubcontractors is warranted, qualification requirements should explicitly be \nincluded in section 3 of the prequalification document. In addition, changing \nsubcontractors at bid submission should only be allowed in exceptional cases, \nprovided such requirements are clearly included in the prequalification documents \nand with prior approval of the borrower or ADB. \n\nDepending on the circumstances, the employer may not accept changes \n\n3.31 \nin subcontracting arrangements at bidding stage if, because of reassessment, \nthe applicant is no longer compliant to the evaluation and qualification criteria \nrequirements or it may have implications on competition. \n\n\fConsiderations When Using Prequalification\n\n13\n\n3.32 \nIn most circumstances, it is the experience of the applicant that is being \nprequalified, regardless of how the role of the applicant was described at the time \nthat experience was obtained. Where applicants submit experience gained as \nsubcontractor, this may be viewed as equivalent to experience obtained as main \ncontractor subject to an assessment of the extent of the involvement, scope or \ncomplexity, and nature of work and services provided by the subcontractor under \nthe previous contract. Before deciding, this should be carefully assessed on a  \ncase-by-case basis.\n\nClaiming experience of affiliated companies to satisfy qualification \n\n3.33 \nrequirements. The ADB Standard Procurement Document for Prequalification \nof Bidders (SPQD) (in its Instructions to Applicants [ITA] clause ITA 25.4) \nstates that \u201cunless permitted in the Application Data Sheet, the qualifications of \nthe other firms, including the Applicant\u2019s subsidiaries, parent entities, affiliates, \nsubcontractors (other than Specialist Subcontractors in accordance with ITA 25.2) \nor any other firm(s) different from the Applicant shall not be considered.\u201d In the \ndefault provision of the SPQD, it is the applicant who must meet the qualification \nrequirements. However, in exceptional circumstances, depending on the nature of \nthe project scope and market assessment, the applicant may claim the experience, \ncapability, and resources of its parent, subsidiary, and/or other affiliates3 (referred to \ncollectively as \u201caffiliates\u201d) for the purposes of meeting the minimum qualification \nrequirements for a specific application, provided such requirements were prior \nreviewed, agreed by ADB, and included in the prequalification documents \nbefore issuance. For further details on this topic, refer to the ADB User\u2019s Guide to \nPrequalification of Bidders (2018).\n\n3 \n\n\u201cAffiliates\u201d is a broad term and would include, in addition to parent and subsidiary companies, \n\u201csister\u201d companies of an applicant\u2014that is, companies that are owned directly or indirectly by \nthe applicant\u2019s parent company.\n\n\fiV.\u2003Prequalification Process\n\n4.1 \nFigure 4 shows the process flow for prequalification.\n\nThe borrower manages assessing the qualifications of prospective bidders. \n\n4.2 \nfollowing subsections.\n\nThe main steps in the prequalification process are summarized in the \n\nA.  \n\nStep 1: Notification and Advertisement\n\nTimely notification of procurement opportunities is essential in open \n\n4.3 \ncompetitive bidding, providing applicants with enough time to prepare and submit \nprequalification applications.\n\n4.4 \nAn Invitation for Prequalification (IFP) is required to be developed and \npublished by the borrower in accordance with requirements for notification and \nadvertising of bidding opportunities described in the 2017 procurement regulations \nand the Guidance Note on Open Competitive Bidding.\n\nNotification of a forthcoming procurement is required to be issued prior \n\n4.5 \nto the issuance of an IFP through a procurement notice.

For details on other aspects of evaluation criteria, refer to \nthe\u00a0SPQD.\n\n1. \n\neligibility\n\nThe SPQD specifies the criteria used to determine whether applicants are \n\n4.12 \neligible to participate in projects. An applicant will not be eligible under a project \nthat ADB finances, administers, or supports while under temporary suspension or \ndebarment by ADB, pursuant to the ADB Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date)4 and the ADB Integrity Principles and Guidelines (2015, as amended from \ntime to time),5 whether such debarment was directly imposed by ADB, or enforced \nby ADB pursuant to the Agreement for Mutual Enforcement of Debarment \nDecisions (2006).6\u00a0An applicant that has a conflict of interest, or is suspended \nor debarred will be rejected. An application for prequalification from an ineligible \napplicant must be rejected.7\n\nState-owned enterprises are eligible to participate provided they meet the \n\n4.13 \nrequirements included in the prequalification documents. For further details, refer \nto Guidance Note on State-Owned Enterprises.\n\n4.14 \nSome borrowers maintain registers of contractors and suppliers. \nSuch\u00a0registers cannot be used as substitute for the prequalification process under \nopen competitive bidding. Prequalification is open to all applicants who meet the \neligibility requirements as defined in the specific prequalification documents. \n\n2. \n\nhistorical Contract nonperformance\n\nEvaluation of historical contract nonperformance is new to the \n\n4.15 \nprequalification process. This criterion seeks to identify applicants that have a \nhistory of contract nonperformance. Refer to the SPQD for more information.\n\n4.16 \nThe preferred method for distribution of the prequalification document \nis electronic. Where documents are distributed in hard copy, a nominal fee may be \ncharged.\n\nSufficient time should be allowed for the submission of applications\u2014\n\n4.17 \nfrom the date of publication of the IFP\u2014to enable applicants to properly \nprepare their applications. For less complex contracts, a minimum of 6 weeks for \ninternationally advertised contracts and 4 weeks for nationally advertised contracts \n\n4  ADB. 2010. Anticorruption and Integrity.

Such periods should be shortened or lengthened appropriately depending on \nthe nature and complexity of contracts.\n\n4.18 \nAfter issuance of the prequalification document, borrowers must \npromptly respond to requests for clarifications from applicants and amend, \nas needed, the prequalification document. Where prior review is required, the \nprequalification document may be amended only with the prior approval of ADB \n(for details on review requirements, refer to the Guidance Note on Procurement \nReview).\n\nC.  \n\nStep 3: Submission and Evaluation of Applications\n\n4.19 \nThe borrower should perform due diligence on the qualifications of the \napplicant, including rigorous and careful review of supporting documents, to be \nassured of their eligibility and capabilities in relation to the contract at issue. During \nthe evaluation, the borrower must\n\n(i)  maintain strict confidentiality throughout the evaluation process,\n(ii)  reject any attempts or pressures to distort the outcome of the \nevaluation and maintain the highest ethical standards, and\n(iii)  strictly apply only and all the qualification criteria specified in the \n\nprequalification document. \n\n4.20 \nEvaluation Report (PQER).

For further information, refer to ADB\u2019s Guide on Bid \nEvaluation (2018). \n\n4.21 \nThe report should be submitted to ADB where prior review is being \napplied. ADB may then ask the borrower to justify the evaluation and provide \nfurther information or clarification.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, where the prequalification exercise is found \n\n4.22 \nto be flawed (e.g., the prequalification criteria were set such that no, or very few, \napplicants were able to meet the requirements for prequalification, yet it is known \nthat the supply market has the capability to adequately perform the contract), the \nborrower can either accept the result and move forward with the bid, or declare \nthe prequalification exercise void and progress to an open bid. Alternatively, the \nborrower can revise the prequalification document and reconduct the exercise; \nhowever, this should only be done where this will lead to improved competition \nand improved project outcomes. Where prior review is required, ADB should be \nconsulted on the course of action.\n\n\fPrequalification Process\n\n19\n\nD.  \n\nStep 4: Notification of Applicants\n\nThe last step in the process is to inform all applicants, in writing, of the \n\n4.23 \noutcome of the prequalification assessment. For each applicant, the outcome \ncan\u00a0be\n\n(i)  applicant meets the criteria and has been prequalified or\n(ii)  applicant has not met the criteria and has not been prequalified. \n\n4.24  Where applicants have been disqualified, specific reasons should be given \nfor the rejection of their application.\n\nThe borrower should publish the list of prequalified applicants, and invite \n\n4.25 \nprequalified applicants to bid as soon as possible. ADB does not recommend \nlong gaps between the completion of prequalification and the start of the bidding \nprocess. It also encourages the bidding documents to be made available to the \nprequalified prospective applicant as soon as prequalification is completed, \ngenerally within 6 months upon receipt of a no-objection notice from ADB. \nA\u00a0period longer than 6 months may require a fresh prequalification process or other \nsuitable options, with prior agreement with ADB. \n\nThe borrower should make clear to qualified applicants that verification of \n\n4.26 \nthe information provided during prequalification may occur at the time of bidding, \nand that if the information is unable to be verified satisfactorily, the applicant\u2019s bid \nmay be rejected at the discretion of the borrower.\n\n\fV.\u2003resources for Further review\n\n5.1 \nprequalification:\n\nThese resources may be consulted for further information related to \n\n(i)  Guide on Bid Evaluation: \n\nhttps://www.adb.org/documents/guide-bid-evaluation\n\n(ii)  Standard Procurement Document for Prequalification of Bidders:  \nhttps://www.adb.org/site/business-opportunities/operational-\nprocurement/goods-services/documents#prequalification\n\n(iii)  User\u2019s Guide to Prequalification of Bidders: \n\nhttps://www.adb.org/documents/prequalification-bidders-users-guide\n\n\fPrequalification\nGuidance Note on Procurement\n\nThis guidance note discusses prequalification as a mechanism to ensure that only \nqualified applicants submit bids for the supply of goods, works, and services, and \nprocesses to be followed for projects financed in whole or in part by an ADB loan \nor\u00a0grant, or by ADB-administered funds. Under ADB\u2019s 2017 procurement framework, \nthere are new features to the prequalification process, including the ability to limit \nthe number of qualified applicants that are invited to bid and criteria for historical \ncontract nonperformance. Prequalification is optional and should be used on a \u201cfit-for-\npurpose\u201d basis, where the nature and complexity of the contract enable the value of \nprequalification to exceed its costs and\u00a0risks.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its \ndeveloping member countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their \npeople. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to a large share of the \nworld\u2019s poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic \ngrowth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, \nequity investments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\n\nasian deVeloPMent bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["PREQUALIFICATION\nGUIDANCE NOTE ON PROCUREMENT\n", "JUNE 2018\n", "ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n", "   Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0  \n  IGO license (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 IGO) \n", "\u00a9 2018 Asian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City, 1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nTel +63 2 632 4444; Fax +63 2 636 2444\nwww.adb.org\n", "Some rights reserved.
