These replace the former Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) and Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). The procurement policy and the \nprocurement regulations address the procurement activities of project executing \nagencies and implementing agencies on projects financed in whole or in part by a \nloan or grant from ADB, or by ADB-administered funds. ADB designed the 2017 \nprocurement policy to deliver significant benefits and flexibility throughout the \nproject procurement cycle, as well as to improve project delivery through a renewed \nfocus on the concepts of quality, value for money (VFM), and fitness for purpose.\nThis note is part of a series of guidance notes published by ADB in 2018 to \naccompany the 2017 procurement policy and the procurement regulations. \nEach\u00a0note discusses a topical issue for borrowers (including grant recipients), \nbidders, and civil society under the new framework (see list below).

VFM is part of a holistic procurement structure \nwith three support pillars: efficiency, quality, and flexibility. The two key principles of \ntransparency and fairness weave across all elements of the structure.\ntransparency\nValue for Money\nThe effective, efficient, and economic use of resources,  \nwhich requires an evaluation of relevant costs and benefits along  \nwith an assessment of risks, nonprice attributes, and/or total cost  \nof ownership as appropriate\nefficiency Quality Flexibility\n\u2022\tDecreased transaction  \u2022\tContract management  \u2022\tOpen competitive \ncosts support bidding\n\u2022\tIncreased skills \u2022\tPrompt resolution of  \u2022\tDecentralization\n\u2022\tIncreased high-level  complaints \u2022\tAccreditation \ntechnology usage \u2022\tImproved developing  for alternative \n\u2022\tImproved  member country  procurement \nprocurement planning procurement process  arrangements\n\u2022\tSupport and  \u2022\tImproved  \u2022\tPrinciples-based \nencouragement  procurement planning decisions\nof e-procurement  \u2022\tGovernance \u2022\tImproved \nsystems \u2022\tContracts with clear  procurement planning\nperformance criteria \u2022\tDelegation\n\u2022\tMinimal number of  \u2022\tBids with weighted  \ncomplaints proposal  \n\u2022\tImproved ADB  criteria \nprocesses \nFairness\ntime\nTime is an important element of VFM. When a project is delivered promptly or when a \nprocess is completed rapidly, greater value is created for all stakeholders. For example, a \nroad project completed early provides economic benefit, security, or other value to the \ncommunity it serves. It increases the return on investment to the executing agency and \naccelerates the project and payment cycle to the successful bidder. Likewise, a project \ndelivered late loses significant value. \nWhen considering VFM in the context of procurement, pay attention to anything \nthat (i)\u00a0shortens the procurement cycle time frame or (ii) accelerates delivery of the \ndevelopment project.", "About This Publication vii\nobjective\nThis guidance note is intended to assist readers by elaborating on and explaining  \nADB\u2019s 2017\u00a0procurement policy and procurement regulations for borrowers \n(including grant\u00a0recipients). \nThis note identifies additional information for the reader to consider when applying ADB\u2019s \nprocurement policy and procurement regulations to their circumstances. \nliving document\nThis guidance note is intended to be a living document and will be revised as required.\nBe sure to check the ADB Business Center website for the latest version and updates,  \nhttps://www.adb.org/business/main.\nthe reader \nIn many circumstances, readers are expected to use this guidance note in a manner unique \nto their needs.

The Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers: Goods, Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting \nServices (2017, as amended from time to time) include prequalification as a \nmechanism intended to ensure that only those applicants that have adequate \ncapabilities and resources submit bids for the supply of goods, works, and services.\n1.2  Prequalification is a process associated with open competitive bidding \nwherein the borrower (or grant recipient) assesses the suitability of applicants \nto carry out a specific contract before inviting them to submit bids. Generally, \nall\u00a0applicants that meet the minimum prequalification criteria are invited to bid. \nThere are situations where the number of successfully prequalified applicants \ninvited to submit bids may be limited (section III of this guidance note).\n1.3  The prequalification process is distinct from the bid process\u2014which \nconcentrates on the technical and financial aspects of specific bids.\n1.4  The prequalification procedure described in this guidance note applies \nto the procurement of (i) goods; (ii) large and complex works; (iii)  plant: design, \nsupply, and install; and (iv) design-and-build projects, among others, requiring \nbidders (or a group of bidders) who are suitably experienced in the type of work and \nconstruction technology involved in the contract to demonstrate their capacity.\n1.5  In the case of consulting services, prequalification is included in the \ncontext of the process of shortlisting firms and is considered in the Guidance \nNote on Consulting Services Administered by ADB Borrowers. Prequalification of \nnonconsulting services is considered in the Guidance Note on Nonconsulting Services \nAdministered by ADB Borrowers.\n1.6  The prequalification process is optional and should be used on a \u201cfit-for-\npurpose\u201d basis, i.e., where the nature and complexity of the contract are such that \nthe value of prequalification would create in the procurement process exceeds \nthe costs and its associated risks.

Disadvantages\n2.1  Potential disadvantages of prequalification include that\n(i)  it may increase the total procurement process time; and\n(ii)  it may facilitate corruption and collusion among applicants, since the \nidentification of prequalified applicants will be made public. ", "iii.\u2003Considerations When \nusing\u00a0Prequalification\n3.1  Several factors should be given special consideration when deciding to \nconduct prequalification:\n(i)  limiting the number of bidders,\n(ii)  treatment of multiple \u201clots,\u201d and\n(iii) treatment of subcontractors. \nA.   Limiting the Number of Bidders\n3.2  Generally, all applicants that meet the minimum prequalification \ncriteria should be invited to bid. However, the 2017 procurement regulations \n(in Appendix\u00a03, para. 19) allow the borrower to limit the number of prequalified \napplicants to be invited to bid for the contract, provided\n(i)  any criteria used to limit the number of prequalified applicants to be \ninvited to bid are stated in the prequalification documents, and \n(ii)  doing this does not limit fair competition. \n3.3  Limiting the number of prequalified applicants invited to bid should be \nused sparingly and only in the following circumstances:\n(i)  Where the strategic procurement planning suggests that the executing \nagency has capacity to administer the process effectively (refer to the \nGuidance Note on Strategic Procurement Planning). \n(ii)  Where the relevant expertise cannot be identified from the standard \nprequalification criteria, e.g., in projects that are highly specialized or \ninvolve high-level technology (refer to the Guidance Note on High-\nLevel Technology).\n(iii) Where the means of delivering the project outcomes require \ninnovation, or the project outcomes can be delivered in different ways.\n(iv) Where the market assessment suggests there may be a large number \nof applicants that are likely to be prequalified. \n3.4  Limiting the number of prequalified applicants invited to bid is achieved \nby using \u201cscorable\u201d prequalification criteria. These are criteria related to the special \nrequirements of the project that are scored against a predefined scoring scale so \nthat overall scores are calculated for each applicant for the purpose of comparison \nof their relative capabilities. The scored prequalification criteria are used in addition \nto the pass/fail prequalification criteria.", "6 Prequalification\n3.5  Two methods can be used to reduce the number of prequalified \napplicants invited to bid:\n(i)  the minimum cut-off score methodology and\n(ii)  the score ranking methodology. \n3.6  The minimum cut-off score methodology involves setting a minimum \nscore against the scored prequalification criteria that applicants must meet to be \nprequalified. In this methodology, all applicants that have achieved the minimum \ncut-off score must be invited to bid.\n3.7  The ranking methodology involves selecting the top scoring applicants \nto be invited to bid. The number of applicants to be invited to bid is required to be \nstated in the prequalification document.\n3.8  To ensure that applicants invited to bid are of a suitable quality, the \nborrower may wish to combine the ranking and the minimum cut-off score \nmethodologies, stating in the prequalification document that a fixed number \n(or\u00a0range) of prequalified applicants will be invited to bid subject to meeting a \nspecified minimum cut-off score.\n3.9  The choice of methodology used should be informed by the market \nassessment and the nature of the contract. For example, if the assessment \nshows a large number of applicants are likely to be prequalified, or the number of \napplicants likely to be prequalified is unknown, the ranking approach may be more \nsuitable. If capability of bidders is the primary consideration, a minimum cut-off \nscore may be more suitable (if limiting prequalified applicants is still considered \nappropriate in this circumstance). If the market assessment shows a small number \nof applicants, the use of prequalification may not be an appropriate option. Instead, \npostqualification should be used with the appropriate qualification criteria.\n3.10  An example of a prequalification evaluation using pass/fail and scored \nprequalification criteria to limit bidders, using the minimum cut-off score \nmethodology, is shown in Figure 2.2 Note that the scored prequalification criteria \nand the scoring scale shown in the example are for illustration purposes only and \nwill vary depending on the nature of the contract, contract requirements, and the \nborrower\u2019s preferred scoring scale methodology.\n3.11  In this example, a two-step evaluation process is used. In Step 1, \napplications are assessed against the standard pass/fail prequalification criteria and \nassessed as either \u201cpass\u201d or \u201cfail.\u201d In this example, Applicants C and D fail one or \nmore of the pass/fail criteria and, therefore, do not progress to the next stage of the \nevaluation.\n2  Note that, in this example, a minimum cut-off score of 80% was used.", "Considerations When Using Prequalification 7\nFigure 2: Example of the Use of Scored Criteria to Limit Bidders,  \nUsing the Minimum Score Method\nPrequalification Scoring  Applicant Applicant Applicant Applicant Applicant Applicant Applicant \nEvaluation Criteria Method A B C D E F G\nStep 1: Pass/Fail Prequalification Criteria\nEligibility Pass/Fail Pass Pass Pass Pass Pass Pass Pass\nHistorical  Pass/Fail Pass Pass Fail Pass Pass Pass Pass\nContract \nNonperformance\nFinancial  Pass/Fail Pass Pass Pass Pass Pass Pass Pass\nSituation\nAverage Annual  Pass/Fail Pass Pass Pass Fail Pass Pass Pass\nTurnover\nTechnical  Pass/Fail Pass Pass Pass Pass Pass Pass Pass\nCapacity\nExperience  Pass/Fail Pass Pass Fail Pass Pass Pass Pass\n(contracts of \nsimilar size and \nnature)\nExperience (key  Pass/Fail Pass Pass Pass Pass Pass Pass Pass\nactivities)\nStep 1 Result Pass/Fail Pass Pass Fail Fail Pass Pass Pass\nStep 2: Scored Prequalification Criteria (Used for limiting bidders.

The Step\u00a02  \nresult is calculated by dividing the sum of the 5 criteria scores together and dividing \nby the maximum possible score of 25 to arrive at an overall percentage score \n(e.g.,\u00a0Applicant A\u2019s overall Step 2 score = 100 x (4+4+3+5+5)/25 = 84%). This \ncalculation method implies equal weighting applied to each scored prequalification \ncriterion, but different weightings may be applied to reflect the relative importance of \nthe criteria.\n3.13  In this example, a minimum cut-off score of 80% was set and \ndocumented in the prequalification document. Applicants A, F, and G meet the \nminimum score and so are selected to be invited to bid. Applicants B and E did not \nmeet the minimum score of 80% and so were not selected to be invited to bid.\n3.14  Note that similar criteria can be used as pass/fail criteria and scored \nprequalification criteria, if suitable. In the above example, one of the standard pass/\nfail criteria in Step 1 is Experience, expressed as a minimum number of contracts \nof a similar size and nature. The pass level may be three contracts of a similar size \nand nature in the past 5 years. A similar Experience criterion is used in Step 2 as a \nscored criterion, namely, \u201cNumber of successfully completed contracts of similar \nsize and nature in past 5 years in excess of the minimum requirement.\u201d Utilizing ", "Considerations When Using Prequalification 9\na rating scale of 0 to 5, scores may be assigned based on the number of contracts \nthe\u00a0applicant has performed in excess of the minimum requirement as illustrated \nin\u00a0Table 2.\nTable 2: Example Evaluation Score Definitions  \nfor Scored Prequalification Criteria\nCriterion = Experience (Number of contracts performed in past 5 years in excess of the \nminimum requirement)\nEvaluation Score 0 1 2 3 4 5\nNumber of contracts  0  2  4  6  8  10 or \nin excess of minimum  contracts contracts contracts contracts contracts more \nrequirement   contracts\n(i.e., in excess of three)\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n3.15  Using this method, an applicant that has performed a total of five \ncontracts, passes the Experience criterion in Step 1 having met the minimum \nrequirement of three contracts, and is given an evaluation score of 1 in Step 2 \nbecause it has performed two contracts in excess of the minimum requirement \nof\u00a0three.\n3.16  Scored evaluation criteria that may be used to limit bidders may include\n(i)  management capability,\n(a)  risk management processes and systems,\n(b)  knowledge management and continuous improvement,\n(c)  quality management system and quality assurance processes, and\n(d)  workplace health and safety management systems; \n(ii)  project methodology and capability,\n(a)  project management capability, and\n(b)  preliminary project methodology; \n(iii) innovation and high-level technology capability,\n(a)  innovative solutions supporting project objectives, and\n(b)  experience in the use of the high-level technology. \n3.17  The use of scored prequalification criteria carries with it the risk that \nsubjectivity may be introduced into the prequalification process. In the above \nexample, the scored criterion \u201crisk management processes and systems\u201d is difficult \nto evaluate with complete objectivity. A way of reducing subjectivity is to use \nquantifiable criteria (e.g., the number of contracts of similar size and nature). \nEven\u00a0so, there may be some subjectivity in the interpretation of applicant responses \nin determining scores and, therefore, sound professional judgment will be required \nduring the evaluation.", "10 Prequalification\n3.18  Another way to reduce subjectivity is to establish \u201cscore descriptors\u201d prior \nto issuance of prequalification documents, setting out evidence required to be \nprovided by applicants in support of the criteria at each score level.

Treatment of Multiple Contracts/Lots\n3.22  Depending on the nature of the project, the scope may be divided into \nseparate \u201ccontracts/lots\u201d as per the following example:\n(i)  Lot 1: Build road section A (60 kilometers [km]).\n(ii)  Lot 2: Build road section B (80 km). \n3.23  The borrower may decide to conduct separate prequalification exercises \nfor each contract/lot, or for groups of contracts/lots (\u201cpackages\u201d). In the latter case, \ncontracts/lots should only be grouped into packages in the same prequalification \nexercise if such are of similar type, size, and scope. In the case of prequalification \nexercises involving multiple contracts/lots, applicants should be instructed in \nthe prequalification documents to indicate the contracts/lots for which they \nare\u00a0applying.\n3.24  It should be noted that when prequalifying applicants using multiple \ncontracts/lots grouped into a package, the objective of the exercise is to determine \nwhether applicants qualify for each contract/lot in the package separately \nand whether the applicants have the capacity to perform all contracts/lots or \ncombinations of contracts/lots. In the example in Figure 3, applicants would be \nprequalified for Lot 1 and Lot 2 individually. No opinion would be given on whether \napplicants could perform Lots 1 and 2 combined.

Treatment of Subcontractors\n3.30  The prequalification of subcontractors should generally be avoided \nat the prequalification stage, because it may lock applicants into subcontract \narrangements without the ability to change at the time of bidding. Instead, \nsubcontractors\u2019 capabilities should be assessed during the bid. However, \nif\u00a0the nature of the project and key activities are such that prequalification of \nsubcontractors is warranted, qualification requirements should explicitly be \nincluded in section 3 of the prequalification document. In addition, changing \nsubcontractors at bid submission should only be allowed in exceptional cases, \nprovided such requirements are clearly included in the prequalification documents \nand with prior approval of the borrower or ADB. \n3.31  Depending on the circumstances, the employer may not accept changes \nin subcontracting arrangements at bidding stage if, because of reassessment, \nthe applicant is no longer compliant to the evaluation and qualification criteria \nrequirements or it may have implications on competition.

For further details, refer \nto Guidance Note on State-Owned Enterprises.\n4.14  Some borrowers maintain registers of contractors and suppliers. \nSuch\u00a0registers cannot be used as substitute for the prequalification process under \nopen competitive bidding. Prequalification is open to all applicants who meet the \neligibility requirements as defined in the specific prequalification documents. \n2.  historical Contract nonperformance\n4.15  Evaluation of historical contract nonperformance is new to the \nprequalification process. This criterion seeks to identify applicants that have a \nhistory of contract nonperformance. Refer to the SPQD for more information.\n4.16  The preferred method for distribution of the prequalification document \nis electronic. Where documents are distributed in hard copy, a nominal fee may be \ncharged.\n4.17  Sufficient time should be allowed for the submission of applications\u2014\nfrom the date of publication of the IFP\u2014to enable applicants to properly \nprepare their applications.

Step 3: Submission and Evaluation of Applications\n4.19  The borrower should perform due diligence on the qualifications of the \napplicant, including rigorous and careful review of supporting documents, to be \nassured of their eligibility and capabilities in relation to the contract at issue. During \nthe evaluation, the borrower must\n(i)  maintain strict confidentiality throughout the evaluation process,\n(ii)  reject any attempts or pressures to distort the outcome of the \nevaluation and maintain the highest ethical standards, and\n(iii) strictly apply only and all the qualification criteria specified in the \nprequalification document. \n4.20  After evaluating applications, borrowers should prepare a Prequalification \nEvaluation Report (PQER).
