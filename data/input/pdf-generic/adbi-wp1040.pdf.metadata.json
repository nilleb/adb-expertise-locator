HSR can simultaneously become a core component on \ndesired urban developments, while also having undesirable outcomes. Positive impacts will \nbe achieved only if interactions with other factors and contexts are maintained. This paper \nstratifies and expands the understanding of the development effects of HSR at three levels  \n\u2013 regional, urban, and station area \u2013 based on the economic and temporal nature of all \ninfrastructure projects. \n \nThere is ample evidence that at the regional level, the implementation of an HSR service \ndisrupts the existing network of cities along the proposed corridor. The HSR network changes \nthe accessibility of a locality. Better accessibility will change the mobility patterns and will \neventually affect the development in the impacted region, reshaping the entire urban-regional \nsystem. The HSR is expected to play a catalyzing role in driving the spatial and urban \ntransformation process. This paper emphasizes the importance of establishing a synergy \nbetween HSR and urban development. A synergy between HSR and other elements, like \nurban  transit  facilities,  paratransit,  station  area  development,  node,  and  sub-center \ndevelopment,  can  usher  in  spatial  and  economic  development,  but  an  institutional \narrangement across all the elements is of paramount importance. Such a synergy would \nenhance livability and provide improved quality of life opportunities in cities and regions served \nby HSR. \n \nLast, an HSR corridor is beneficial both to the settlements along the corridor and to the railway \noperator. An HSR corridor is also beneficial to the cities along the railways, and the station \nareas provide an important opportunity to harness revenue through non-railway businesses. \nHowever, achieving the full development effects of an HSR project may take decades. Careful \npre-planning of the project and coordination amongst the stakeholders are necessary to \naccomplish a set of phased goals to realize the envisioned development of an HSR corridor. \n \nKeywords: high-speed rail, regional development, urban development, station area \ndevelopment \n \nJEL Classification: O18, R11, R12, R52, R58 \n \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1040  Bharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n \nContents \n \n \n1.

DEFINING HIGH-SPEED RAILWAY AND ITS STATUS \nTHROUGHOUT THE WORLD \nSince the origin of railways in Great Britain in the early 19th century, \u2018high-speed\u2019 has \nbeen a time-relative concept. The 56 km Liverpool-Manchester Railway was the world\u2019s \nfirst passenger railway developed for intercity transport. The 50km/h speed record \nachieved by the steam-powered \u2018Rocket\u2019 locomotive in 1830 represented a truly high \nspeed for its time. Soon, with the change in technology, passenger rail travel would see \ntremendous upgrades in speed. The German diesel trains achieved 215km/h in 1939; \nFrench electric-powered TGV holds the current record on steel rails at 574km/h (set in \n2007). More recently, the magnetic levitation Chuo Shinkansen of Japan achieved  \n603 km/h on a test track in Central Japan. \nIn rail transport, trains that use specialized rolling stock and operate at more than  \n250 km/h on new dedicated lines and 200 km/h or 220 km/h on upgraded lines are \naccepted as HSR, as per the International Union of Railways (UIC 2008), although there \nis no single standard definition of HSR. In order to provide a non-speed related definition, \nCampos and de Rus (2009) reviewed the technical and economic characteristics of 166 \nHSR lines in 20 countries. Examining various lines \u2013 based on the infrastructure, \ndevelopment costs, operation costs, and forecasted demand \u2013 the authors distinguish \nfour HSR network types, namely, the exclusive exploitation type, mixed speed type, \nconventional mixed type, and thoroughly mixed type. The description makes it clear that \nHSR is a combination of various infrastructural elements, which together form a single, \nintegrated system and should be observed as a complete system. Figure 1 compares \nthe planned and currently operational HSR corridors across the world (Bharule 2019a).  \n1.1  Japan \nJapan is the pioneer in introducing the HSR to the world. The first HSR link in the \nJapanese Rail network came into commercial service in 1964, connecting Tokyo to \nOsaka. Known as the Shinkansen (\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda), meaning \u2018new trunk line,\u2019 the 515.4 km \nTokaido line corridor was built in a linear geographic setting that was apt for rail travel, \nwith a primary goal of expanding the capacity on an overcrowded route. Takatsu (2007) \npoints out that the design of the Tokaido line alignment attempted to use existing railway \nstations through many cities along the corridor served by new stations. The author \nhighlights that after the first speed upgrade from 210 km/hr to 270 km/hr in 1992, the \ntravel time was reduced to 3 hours and 10 minutes, making Tokyo\u2013Osaka day trips \nfeasible. \n1.2  Republic of Korea \nThe Republic of Korea's Seoul\u2013Busan axis is the primary passenger and freight traffic \ncorridor. The National Rail operator introduced the Korail Express (KTX) HSR service in \n2004. The KTX service has shrunk the inter-city travel time to fewer than three hours. \nThis has not only changed commuting habits and lifestyles, but it has also had a \nsignificant  social,  economic,  and  cultural  impact  (Terabe  et  al.  n.d.).  Since  the \nintroduction of KTX, the number of rail passengers has increased, alongside a significant \ndecrease in the number passengers opting for private cars, express buses, and aircraft \nto travel along the same route. The national government aims to expand the KTX network \nand reduce the road usage to the extent that it is possible to reach any part of the country \nwithin 1 hour and 30 minutes (The Chosun Ilbo 2010). \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1040  Bharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n \nFigure 1: Comparison of Global High-Speed Rail Corridor Length \n \nSource: Adapted from Bharule (2019a). \n1.3  Taipei,China \nPlans for Taipei,China\u2019s first HSR corridor came to light in 1989. The plan aimed  \nto  tackle  the  growing  issues  in  managing  the  congestion  between  Taipei,China\u2019s  \ntwo largest cities. The THSRC, HSR Corporation operates 345 km of HSR between \nTaipei,China in the north, to Kaohsiung in the south. Valued at $13 billion at the  \ntime of implementation, the project was one of the world\u2019s largest privately funded railway \nconstruction projects. Under the Station Zone Development Agreement, the government \ngranted the rail corporation a 50-year concession to develop the land surrounding the \nstations for commercial, residential, and recreational purposes (Terabe et al. 2013). \nAlthough the project started without much delay, the ridership count was lower than \nexpected. The government revived the debt-ridden company, introducing new operations \nand management structure. The Government of Taipei,China is a major stakeholder in \nthe THSRC, but the company operations are privately managed (Chen 2018). The \noperator expects an increase in ridership after the opening of more stations on the line \nin the near future. \n1.4  People\u2019s Republic of China \nThe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) leads the world in terms of HSR line length. The \nMid-to-Long Term Railway Network Plan, laid out for Horizon 2020 and adopted by the \ngovernment in 2004, was updated in 2008. Under this plan, the Beijing\u2013Tianjin HSR was \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1040  Bharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n \nfirst of a new generation of HSR, opened in August 2008 with a maximum speed of 350 \nkm/hour. High density corridors, like Beijing\u2013Shanghai and Beijing\u2013Guangzhou, have a \ndesign speed of 350 km/hr, one of the highest in the world, while several other corridors \nwith  more  modest  passenger  volumes  have  a  maximum  design  speed  of  \n250 km/hour. Generally, both of these types of HSR projects in the PRC are passenger-\ndedicated lines (PDL) and green-field projects (UIC 2008). At the end of December 2013, \nmost of the metropolitan regions in the PRC were either connected, or in the process of \nbeing connected, to lines with a maximum speed of 200 km/hour or higher (Ollivier, \nSondhi, and Zhou 2014). \nThe PRC\u2019s HSR network is expected to span 30,000 km by 2020. This expansion will \nhelp in connecting 80% of PRC cities by creating eight corridors, each from north to south \nand  east  to  west.  This  network  configuration  is  envisioned  to  revitalize  many \neconomically challenged cities in west and central PRC, because of the hub effect \ncreated by the HSR system, especially at junctions (Li et al. 2016). With increasing \npassenger  flow  and  accessibility,  cities  on  HSR  lines  are  becoming  strategically \nimportant targets for industries, such as hotels, catering, logistics, and real estate. While \nregional economic differences are not rare in a global economy, the PRC\u2019s regional \ndifferences are by far the most disparate of any in the world (Amos, Bullock, and Sondhi \n[2010]; Ollivier et al. [2014]). \n1.5  Europe \nThe first HSR lines in Europe were built around the 1980s. By connecting important cities, \nthey improved the travel time on intra-national corridors. Private operators operate \nalmost  all  lines  in  the  European  Union  (EU),  and  they  receive  EU  funding.  \nThe  EU  Council  Directive  of  1996  specifically  aimed  to  achieve  interoperability  of  \nHigh-Speed Trains.1 This cross-border infrastructure promotion was the part of larger \nTrans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T), which are a part of wider Trans-European \nNetworks (TENs) envisioned by the EU in 1990. The wider system of TENs includes \ntransportation, telecommunication, and a proposed energy network spread across the \nEU. \n1.6  France \nFrance was the first European country to start HSR services in 1981. The TGV service \nbetween Paris and Lyon has a duration of 2 hours and covers for 450 km, as part of a \nstrategy to decongest the overly congested conventional routes. A dedicated HSR line \nwas  adopted,  and  the  terminals  were  integrated  with  the  existing  stations.  While \nconverging all the lines toward Paris, the French government strategically developed \nmore profitable lines first. In recent years, the observed regional development in terms \nof social returns was higher than expected.2 Such an initiative has encouraged the \ngovernment to contribute to the construction costs and further expand the network.3 \n \n1  EU Law.

As in the case \nof Japan, the incompatible Spanish rail gauge made it necessary to overlay a new \nstandard  gauge  line  (Givoni  2006).  The  first  line  was  progressively  extended  and \nconnected to Barcelona. As a part of an EU Commission to develop an extended Trans-\nEuropean Network (TEN), the Spanish network was connected to the French railway \nnetwork in 2012.4 In 2010, Spain developed the largest HSR network in Europe. With \nthe population concentration around the coast and Madrid in the center of the country, \nSpain developed a radial railway network. Currently, with over 3,200 km of HSR lines, \nSpain\u2019s network is second to the PRC HSR network. \n1.6.2  Germany \nDeutsche Bahn, the German railway company, started its first railway service, InterCity \nExpress (ICE), in 1991. The ICE network is designed to connect many major cities and \nhubs within Germany and in the neighboring countries of France, the Netherlands, \nSwitzerland, Denmark, Belgium, and Austria (Sands 1993). German ICE services are \nused for short to medium distances between the cities, and lines operate at speeds of \n200 km/hr and 250 km/hr (UIC 2008). \n1.6.3  Italy \nItaly partially began its first dedicated HSR in 1978, while a 254 km \u2018direttissima\u2019 line \nconnecting Rome and Florence was under construction. The line was completed in 1992. \nWith the introduction of direttissima lines, the travel time between the main Italian cities \nhas been progressively reduced (Desmaris 2016). Infrastructure in Italy follows the \ncountry\u2019s geography, and the HSR lines are oriented in a north-south perspective, with \nthe greatest density in the north. Italian HSR is an exception in Europe, as the distance \nbetween the cities is shorter compared to other countries, and Italian HSR lines operate \nat different speed levels. A comparison of the operational speed of all HSR lines across \nthe world is shown in Figure 2 (Bharule 2019a). \n   \n \n4  Railway Gazette. (2011).

COUNTRIES CURRENTLY DEVELOPING  \nHSR INFRASTRUCTURE \n2.1  India \nIn early 2010, the Ministry of Railways of the government of India announced \u2013 in its \n\u2018Vision  2020\u2019  \u2013  seven  HSR  lines  connecting  several  cities  in  distinct  parts  of  \nthe country. A 508 km HSR line connecting Mumbai and Ahmedabad along western India \nwill be the first in development. In 2015, India and Japan entered into a \u2018Memorandum \nof  Cooperation  on  High-Speed  Railways.\u2019  Under  the  agreement,  the  Mumbai \nAhmedabad High-Speed Rail will adopt Japanese Shinkansen Technology. Adopting a \ndedicated  track  configuration,  the  line  is  envisioned  to  decongest  India\u2019s  busiest \npassenger railway corridor. The project is estimated to be operational by late December \n2023 and to cost $16 billion funded by Official Development Aid (ODA) from the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency. \n   \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1040  Bharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n \n2.2  Indonesia \nThe Java HSR project is planned to connect the densely populated region between  \nthe national capital Jakarta and the second-largest city, Surabaya, which are located 730 \nkm apart on the Indonesian island of Java. As a part of the PRC\u2019s Belt Road Initiative, a \n150 km initial phase of the rail link is envisioned to be operational by early 2021. After \nseveral rounds of proposals and bidding since 2008, the project was finally awarded to \nthe  PRC  in  2015,  and  it  is  being  developed  at  an  estimated  cost  of  \n$5.5 billion for the first phase connecting Jakarta to Kertajati-International Airport, the \nsecond-largest airport in Indonesia, near Bandung city. \n2.3  Thailand \nThe  Government  of  Thailand  approved  five  HSR  lines  in  late  2010.  Although  the  \nstatus of all lines varies, all the planned 1500 km network converges in Bangkok, the \ncapital city of Thailand. The network will be developed in several stages and it is \nenvisioned to be complete by 2036, with the earliest operation beginning in 2021. The \ncomplete network inclusive of airport links is estimated to cost $30 billion. The Thai HSR \nnetwork is developed as ODA projects, with two lines awarded each to Japan and the \nPRC, while the fifth line is still in the proposal stage. In addition to the network, a 220 km \ncorridor of airport link HSR is under development as a part of the Thai Eastern Economic \nCorridor  (EEC)  Project.  Under  the  EEC  project,  the  airport  link  is  proposed  \nto  connect  three  international  airports  between  Bangkok  and  Pattaya.  Developed  \nunder a Sino-Thai public\u2013private partnership (PPP) consortium, the project is due to \nopen in 2024. \n3.  HSR AND ITS EFFECTS \nSince the early 1900 Japan has been the pioneer in railway operations and integrated \nland development (De Souza, Ochi, and Hosono [2018]). A consistent incremental \nimprovement in the integrated land development practices has resulted in economic \ndevelopment of the cities served by the Shinkansen corridors, suggesting an inter-\ndependence of implementation and the planning process. Over time, services and \nindustries agglomerated along the first Shinkansen corridor, established nodes with \nconnecting transit facilities in cities like Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka, which have emerged \nas prominent hubs (RIDA and OECF 1995). \nThe Republic of Korea has followed the Japanese integrated model of development, but \nhas required additional efforts in integrating regional public transport to the KTX corridors \nand  stations  to  enhance  revenue.  With  the  fast  mobility  of  KTX,  a  new  form  \nof the national economy was born. International conferences could now be held at places \nother than Seoul. The added accessibility attracted almost 10,000 people to connected \ncities from the Seoul capital area (KOTI 2015). This population shift was unprecedented \nin the country\u2019s history. The integration of public transit with KTX is underway around \nhub stations (Lee 2014). \nThe case of THSRC, an HSR corporation in Taipei,China, is unique. After becoming \nalmost bankrupt, the company has resurrected itself in the past ten years by making \nmeticulous efforts to streamline the operations and sustainability of HSR. Reorganizing \nthe  company\u2019s  operations  management;  improving  stakeholder  relationships;  and \nestablishing station-to-city-center bus services, which increased ridership, resulted in \nsteady revenue growth (Chen 2018). \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1040  Bharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n \nThis countrywide discourse makes it clear that it takes more than a decade to establish \na thriving HSR corridor, and that the methods to achieve success can be different. \n3.1  Temporal Effects of HSR \nHSR  systems  are  built  to  reinforce  accessibility  and  strengthen  inter-regional,  as  \nwell as intra-regional, relations. HSR corridors are set between pairs of cities, which \nushers in a paradigm shift for inter-regional mobility, boosting the national economy. \nEmpirical  data  analysis  of  HSR\u2019s  impact  in  Japan  and  other  countries  shows  the  \ndirect impacts of salient features of HSR, like savings in travel time, safety, comfort, \npunctuality, and frequency of trains, which are significant in terms of increased business \nactivity and productivity. With the increased accessibility to better markets, it is possible \nfor businesses located in one region to explore national and international opportunities, \nwhich would previously have been accessible only to businesses located in capital cities. \n3.2  Immediate Effects \nHSR contributes significantly to saving in travel time, comfort, and safety. For 400\u2013700 \nkm distances, HSR is the preferred mode of travel over automobiles and planes. Since \nthe inauguration of the first Shinkansen line, the intercity travel time has reduced by over \n50% in Japan. Technological innovations have helped in upgrading top-speed and train \ncar safety, assuring increased frequency and improving the ride quality (KOTI 2015). \nHSR competes with roadways and airlines, not just because of the change in share, but \nalso the total travel time, including access and egress, with the added comfort and travel \nsafety. \n3.3  Medium-Term Effects \nA city is a complex geographic setting with inter-linked functions. Urban life in a city is \nextremely intertwined, and interdependencies of networks of activities are endless.  \nAn HSR line is one such link connecting and creating important hubs in the cities through \nwhich it travels. Yoshino and Abidhadjaev (2016) analyze the effects of linking cities with \nan HSR in the case of Kyushu Shinkansen in Japan. The Shinkansen line construction \nstarted in 1991. It was partly operational until 2004, and in 2011, it became fully \noperational. During construction, the land price and the property tax revenue increased \nin municipalities around HSR stations. However, the trend around each station varied \nafter the opening of the line. \n4.  HIGH-SPEED RAIL AND DEVELOPMENT \n4.1  HSR and Regional Spillover of Development \nEvidence  through  academic  work  emphasizes  inter-city  and  inter-region  HSR \ninvestments, they can create regional imbalances. When HSR investments are made \nwhere the city or region pairs have different levels of development, such investments \nmay work in favor of primate regions and cities at the expense of weaker surrounding \nregions.5 \n \n5  A primate city distribution is a rank-size distribution that has one very large city with many much smaller \ncities and towns, and no intermediate-sized urban centers. \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1040  Bharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n \nAlong a proposed corridor, cities that will have access to HSR through a station may \naccrue benefits, although the distribution of impacts and gains requires rigorous study. \nCities of regional importance might benefit at the sacrifice of neighboring hinterlands, \nthereby yielding certain impacts, although various research has argued that countries \nwith dominant cities tend to accumulate net benefits. \nUnder the umbrella term of \u2018New Economic Geography\u2019 (NEG), Krugman (1991) explains \nthe prolonged existence of regional disparities. Krugman emphasizes the advantages for \nhigher productivity gains developed due to the agglomeration of economic activity in \nmajor cities, which attracts organizations and labor. NEG is a theoretical framework for \nunderstanding the economic processes that produce regional inequalities (Tomaney \n2012a). The theory explains the choice of location of individual businesses as an \noutcome of a trade-off between increasing returns to scale and optimum transportation \ncosts (Krugman 1999). \nNEG establishes itself as an important principle, although it fails to explain the preference \nof  an  organization  to  relocate  in  urban  areas,  where  costs  of  establishment  are \nsignificantly higher compared to peripheral hinterlands. A city is the resultant product of \nlocalization or agglomeration economies. The concentration of organizations and firms \nin  specialized  clusters  is  understood  as  \u2018localization,\u2019  whereas  the  presence  of \norganizations and firms in cities and urban areas with a diversified economy is referred \nto as \u2018agglomeration\u2019. Fujita and Krugman (2003) conclude that the combination of the \nbenefits of agglomeration and localization in the form of scale economies, labor pool, \nand knowledge spillover collectively explains the \u2018pull effect\u2019 of urban locations on firms. \nFurther detailing the transport cost and regional economic relationship, Lafourcade  \nand  Thisse  (2011)  point  out  that  core  regions  are  more  likely  to  benefit  through  \nreduced transport costs, although these benefits will involve disservice to poorer regions. \nAgglomeration economies generate positive externalities, which are mutually reinforcing. \nTherefore, city regions and their surroundings are likely to create a more competitive \nbusiness environment, resulting in higher overall productivity. As a result, when firms and \nbusinesses located in the core of the region are competing with those located in the \nperiphery of the region, the former has an advantage over the latter. \nNevertheless, a prevailing assumption states that the impact of transport cost reductions \non the regional economies follows a bell curve (Tomaney 2012a). Tracking the timeline \nof  transport  infrastructure,  Rodrigue,  Comtois,  and  Slack  (2016)  clarify  \nthat the concentration of certain economic activities in the immediate agglomerations \nmay in fact be a result of lowered transportation costs. Lower transportation costs  \ntend to expedite redistribution of economic activity, especially toward the periphery. This \nis  particularly  true  for  manufacturing  activities.  However,  this  would  imply  that \ntransportation costs become almost negligible, which might not be the case. In such \ncases, the centrally located peripheral region supports the connected region. \nExamining the trends in regional inequalities in the EU, Puga (2002) focuses on regional \ndisparities. He notes that connectivity augmentation between regions of different levels \nof development not only allows the less developed region to have access to better \nmarkets located in the more developed regions, but it also makes it easier for firms in \ndeveloped regions to supply more impoverished areas. This added advantage may \ndirectly harm the industrialization prospects of areas with lower development levels, and \nthe result may directly affect the environment as well as the quality of life of individuals \n(Hayashi et al. 2015; Rothengatter et al. 2015). \n \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1040  Bharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n \nHighlighting the importance of NEG models, Puga stresses that they not only point out \nthe potential ambiguity of reductions in transport costs on less developed regions. The \nmodels also clarify that the overall effects depend not just on the characteristics of the \ntransportation infrastructure projects, but also on specific aspects of the economic \nenvironment where the project is implemented \u2013 for instance, among two regions to be \nconnected by new transport infrastructure and if the difference in wages and inter-\nregional migration are low, and the regions differ widely in terms of the attractiveness to \nbusiness services. \nThe investment in the new transport infrastructure can do very little to reduce the regional \ninequalities. Puga (2002) argues that the potential impact of HSR is primarily focused on \nbusinesses and the location of headquarters. Puga suggests that HSR services give an \nadded advantage for business service providers to serve remote locations and access \nthe headquarters at the same time, which leads to a further concentration of businesses \nin a few large cities. A resultant effect is higher tariffs in cities, making them less attractive \nfor manufacturing firms to relocate. The rise in tariff accelerates the transformation in the \neconomic  geography  from  sectorally  specialized  regions  to  functionally  specialized \nregion (Bharule 2019a). \nOn the emergence of the trend described above, Duranton and Puga (2001) draw \nevidence from France. After the construction of the TGV between Paris and Lyon, the \nTGV investment led to the relocation of business headquarters from Lyon to Paris. This \nmovement contrasted with the government's claims of new commercial development \nalong Part-Dieu station in Lyon, an indicator of the positive effects of HSR. Although \nthere was no mention of net impacts on growth and employment, this points to a negative \nnet impact for the city of Lyon. \nDifferentiating the types of ail investments, Puga (2002) concludes that inter-regional \ninvestment facilitates trade between regions, and intra-regional investment facilitates \ntrade within regions. Puga concludes that improvements in the inter-region infrastructure \nmay  causes  more  harm  than  good  \u2013  especially  to  peripheral  regions  \n\u2013 whereas intra-regional improvements appear to have no negative impacts. Similarly, \nhub-and-spoke type HSR network systems appear to produce different effects on their \nsurroundings. In a multiple spoke network, where several of the spokes or rail corridors \nare connected to a single hub or city core, this tends to promote agglomeration in  \nthe hub. Businesses and firms located at the hub will face lower transport costs to  \nany end of the spoke than firms going from one spoke to another. Moreover, hub \nlocations would tend to trigger inequalities among spoke regions (Duranton and Puga \n2000, 2005, 2014, 2015; Fujita, Krugman, and Mori 1999; Fujita and Mori 1996, 2005; \nPuga 1999). \nHighlighting the ambiguity in the results of the impact assessment of HSR projects,  \nde Rus (2009) concludes that impact assessment using NEG models to ascertain  \nthe  potential  impact  of  lower  transport  costs  on  less  developed  regions  remains \nundetermined. Furthermore, the overall effect on the region would also depend on the \neconomic environment and the characteristics of the transport projects. In this regard, \nthe TEN-T has resulted in developing better accessibility in most of the economic centers \nacross the EU. However, the \u2018time-space convergence\u2019 due to the new infrastructure \nmay widen the relative accessibility gap between the urban core and the periphery. The \nemphasis on HSR links is likely to favor the central and terminal nodes of the HSR \nsystem network and is not likely to promote the development of new activity centers in \nminor nodes or intermediate locations (de Rus 2008). The accessibility gap widens with \neach added HSR service, thus augmenting inequality in regions and reinforcing the core \nregions as transport hubs (Puga 2002). \n9 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1040  Bharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n \nOn the contrary, Rodr\u00ecguez-Pose and Fratesi (2002) argue that the effects on regional \nconvergence were barely noticeable, in spite of investments in new roads, freeways, \nexpressways,  and  high-speed  rail  proposed  under  the  TEN-T  project  masterplan. \nSignificant returns were visible only in the case of education and human capital. They \nconsider several potential reasons for this, but they conclude that the primary reason for \nthe  disappointing  performance  and  low  returns  is  the  weak  relationships  between \ninfrastructure investments and regional convergence. \nHighlighting the bi-directional nature of transport and telecommunication links, they \nemphasize the formulation of a strategy with a strong understanding of the regional \ncharacteristics, which must act as a root of all the infrastructure development in the \nregion. They further explain that providing various activities around the investment \ncorridor may resolve a vital block in development while reducing the gap in infrastructural \ndemand with the rest of Europe (Rodr\u00edguez-Pose and Fratesi [2004]; Tomaney [2012]). \nHowever, such a policy may expose the weaker regions to competition from stronger and \nmore technologically advanced businesses located in the core cities, causing more harm \nthan benefit. \n5.  HSR AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT \nEmpirical evidence through academic work emphasizes that HSR investments become \na catalyst for urban restructuring. Extensive research focuses on one concern: \u2018Location \nof the HSR station with respect to the City Center.\u2019 The HSR-urban interaction can result \nin a boon for urban development. Studying the HSR station location typologies in Europe \n(see Figure 3), Hall (2009) identified three types of urban impacts of HSR depending on \nthe location of the station: \n\u2022  The first type is when the station is located beside or within the traditional Central \nBusiness District (CBD). This improves or reinforces the CBD\u2019s attraction as a \nplace for commercial investment. \n\u2022  The second type of station is usually located on the edges of cities, adjacent  \nto,  but  separate  from,  the  major  urban  centers.  This  helps  in  developing \ncomplementary sub-centers within the urban area. \n\u2022  The third type of station uses the station as a driver for a new commercial \u2018edge \ncity\u2019 on the periphery of the urban area. \nThe latter two types may help in promoting the transformation of a mono-centric city  \nto a poly-centric urban region. Priemus (2008) clarifies that having an HSR station away \nfrom the city center helps in the development of more nodes and urban centers by \nconnecting  the  urban  patterns  and  infrastructure  network  together.  Discussing  the \ndevelopment of the European high-speed rail network, Vickerman, Spiekermann, and \nWegener (1999) demonstrate accessibility improvement for hub cities in the EU, whereas \nperipheral  cities  have  gained  some  improved  accessibility,  but  still  less  \nthan hub cities. Nodal cities gain the most from improvements to the high-speed network, \nwhile places between the nodes or on the edge of the network do not make significant \ngains. \n   \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1040  Bharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n \nFigure 3: Types of HSR Station Location with Respect to CBD and Urban Fabric  \n \nSource: Hall (2009). \nThe HSR-urban interaction should be observed at an urban-regional level. The advent \nof HSR plays two roles in influencing the urban economy: a catalyzing role and a \nfacilitating role. The HSR network plays a catalyzing role by drawing new activities to the \nurban region, and a facilitating role by impacting the cities in terms of accessibility to \nenhance the local economy (van den Berg and Pol 1998). However, the major challenges \nthat loom in the landscape of development adjacent to HSR stations include managing \nthe competition and dynamics between the old and new station areas, nodes, and \ncenters and to blend the new development with the existing urban fabric (Yin, Bertolini, \nand Duan 2015). \n5.1  Characteristics of HSR Station Area Development Projects  \nHSR station areas have been described in various texts using several characteristics \nand indicators. Terrin, Marie, and Leheis (2011) highlighted the characteristics of HSR \ndevelopment  projects  in  the  European  cities  of  Barcelona,  Lille,  Lyon,  Marseille, \nRotterdam, and Turin. They argue that HSR stations may be on their way to becoming a \nnew architectural typology: a new kind of mobility infrastructure that is a hybrid of an \nairport hub and a service-oriented shopping space, while still being a multi-cultural public \nspace at the same time. The highlighted characteristics described are primarily based \non two models: transport infrastructure-led economic development, and a network model \nconnecting local and global hubs while producing mobility-induced services (Terrin \n2016). \nReviewing the urban development impacts induced by HSR, Sands (1993) presents \nempirical evidence from Shinkansen in Japan, the TGV in France, and the ICE in \nGermany. He focused on the change in travel time and urban economic impacts, such \nas demographic changes, as well as station area development and redevelopment. At \nthe local level, his analysis categorized the station in two types: first, HSR that was \nintroduced into existing conventional rail stations and, second, new stations exclusively \nbuilt for HSR. At a regional level, he compared stations by looking at stations where only \nexpress HST stopped in comparison with those served by slow HSTs, which stopped at \nall the stations. \n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1040  Bharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n \nBerg and Pol (1998) propose two groups of cities in the European context: international \nservice cities and cities in transition. They pointed out that international service cities \nsuch as London, Paris, Barcelona, Amsterdam, and Lyon have a competitive edge in the \ninternational  service  and  knowledge  economy,  and,  because  of  their  international \nfacilities, attractiveness, and accessibility, they compete to be global players. The cities \nin transition, such as Lille, Liverpool, Marseilles, Rotterdam, and Turin are often old port \nor industrial cities seeking to transform and boost their economy by attracting new \neconomic activities and inhabitants through investments. Both groups of cities see the \nHSR station as an opportunity to attract more business activity and commercial and real \nestate land development in and around the station area (Pol 1998). However, not all the \nstation area developments observed were similar. For instance, Peters and Novy (2012, \n2013) analyzed cases in Europe and identified four distinct categories of train station \narea development: \n\u2022  Station Renaissance Projects: These were focused on the redevelopment of \nstation facilities, such as the restoration and expansion of historic stations. Some \nstations also enhance the shopping and entertainment facilities within the station \npremises. \n\u2022  Transport  Development  Projects:  The  primary  goal  of  these  projects  is  to \nenhance the transportation infrastructure and improve the transfers between \ndifferent modes available at the station. \n\u2022  Strategic Mega-Projects: They involve significant and large-scale development in \nthe vicinity of a railway station, and they require the active involvement of \nstakeholders in both public and private investment. \n\u2022  Urban Development Projects: The redevelopment of the railway station and its \nsurroundings  must  be  conducted  under  as  single,  integrated  master  plan. \nComplementarity in-land use while master planning of the station surroundings is \ncarried out helps in balancing the pressures on infrastructure. \nComparing  the  case  of  the  proposed  California  HSR  with  Japanese  Shinkansen, \nMurakami and Cervero (2010) examined the locational characteristics of job and labor \nmarkets around the planned HSR stations. They applied cluster analysis to build a \ntypology of 26 proposed stations in California and 17 exiting stations in Japan. The \npurpose of categorization was to assess how different factors would influence the impact \nof HSR on urban development. On the basis of variables based on city characteristics, \nthe authors categorized 26 proposed stations in the following five categories: \n\u2022  Global and regional business centers,  \n\u2022  Edge cities, \n\u2022  Aerotropolis, \n\u2022  Leisure cities, and \n\u2022  Small intermediate cities. \nHall (2003) stresses that the edge city stations have a locational advantage of maximum \npotential for future development, especially when the HSR services directly connect to \nairports. Kasarda (2011) proposed the concept of aerotropolis, a city based on aviation-\nlinked businesses with outlying HSR corridors extending across the clusters of these \nbusiness  and  associated  residential  developments  to  a  30\u201340 km  radius  from  an \ninternational airport. Empirical findings suggest that new HSR projects are more likely to \nlead to benefits in knowledge- and service-based industries along the corridor, but they \ntend to agglomerate in large, globally connected cities (Blanquart and Koning 2017; \n12 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1040  Bharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n \nChen and Hall 2012; Chen, Loukaitou-Sideris, de Ure\u00f1a, and Vickerman 2019; Hall \n2014). Growth may also shift from small intermediate cities to edge cities because of \nenhanced accessibility. \nLearning from cases in Spanish cities, Bellet (2009) finds that cities adopt inter-related \nstrategies on the advent of an HSR: \n\u2022  Strategy: An HSR station is placed in the city periphery, and simultaneous \nremoval occurs of the conventional line tracks from the city center of Ciudad Real. \nThis strategy provided the city with an opportunity to strengthen the core by \nconsequently redeveloping the city center. The new HSR station at the periphery \nis an opportunity to create a secondary center in the city. \n\u2022  Strategy: Using land in a central location to build the HSR station, relocating the \nexisting railway activities in the periphery of Zaragoza city. There is relocation of \nrailway yards, freight facilities, and workshops. This provides a significant amount \nof land in the core city area, making it possible to be redeveloped for commercial \nestablishments. \n\u2022  Strategy: Integrating new HSR services within the existing conventional rail \nstation by expanding the station building and simultaneously redeveloping the \narea around the station in Lleida. The city was able to accommodate more \ncommercial activity in the vicinity of the station. \nLoukaitou-Sideris et al. (2011) discuss six variables that intervene and influence the type \nof urban design strategy and station area development: \n\u2022  Geographic  context:  Large  metro  center,  small  metro  center,  suburban \nemployment center, suburban dormitory and outer-urban dormitory, rural, airport-\nrelated \n\u2022  Ridership: Origin, destination \n\u2022  Station location: Central or peripheral \n\u2022  Network type: Shared with a conventional line or dedicated tracks \n\u2022  Guideway track: Elevated, surface tunnel, type of parking \n\u2022  Type of parking: Structure or surface; concentrated or distributed \nLoukaitou-Sideris and Colton (2017) argue that the geographic context, ridership count, \nand station location directly influence the mix of land use as well as the type and scale \nof development in the station area. The type of rail network will drive the type of \ndevelopment on the adjacent land, whether it is shared with the conventional rail or \ndedicated tracks. The arrangement of the guideway tracks also defines the morphology \nof the surroundings: For instance, stations located underground or elevated stations \nprovide more land for development adjacent to the station in comparison to stations \nlocated on the surface. This aspect, along with the type of parking, would together define \nthe level of integration of the station into its surroundings. \n5.2  Factors That Trigger Station Area Development \nEurope in the past two decades had observed intensification of station area development \nand redevelopment projects. Bertolini and Spit (1998) identify several innovations and \nchanges  that  were  responsible  for  redevelopment  projects  near  \nHSR railway stations across Europe. Changes such as technological innovations, new \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1040  Bharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n \ninstitutional frameworks, and transformation in the spatial dynamics of the region have \nbeen driving innovative public policies, adding to the quality of life. \nCutting-edge engineering and technological innovations, particularly the development of \nHSR, helped in minimizing the distances and improving accessibility of the cities served \nby HSR. This enhanced accessibility worked as a boon for many multi-branch firms. This \ndemand  generated  by  the  relocation  of  firms  triggered  new  developments  around \nstations. One of the most reviewed case studies is that of Lille, a critical junction between \nLondon, Paris, and Brussels on the Channel-Tunnel link. The proposal of a station at this \njunction  triggered  significant  development  in  the  station  surroundings,  known  as \n\u2018Euralille.\u2019 \nPrivatization of railway operating companies is one of the common institutional changes \nfound  across  rail  operators  in  Europe.  Privatization  helps  companies  capture  the \nlocational advantage of a railway station to its maximum potential, attracting investments \nto develop land above and around the station. Not only the railway operators, but also \nthe city municipal corporations, were seen updating their policies in order to improve the \ncity\u2019s competitive image, taking advantage of the HSR investment. This resulted in some \nlarge-scale station-city redevelopment plans. In the case of the Netherlands, such \nredevelopment plans are part of national policies: The country\u2019s HSR stations are part of \nsizeable nation-wide, government-funded urban development projects, referred to as the \n\u2018New Key Projects\u2019 (Bruinsma et al. 2008). \nIn addition to the aim to gain economic advantages, policies for urban development are \noften provoked by a desire for sustainable, inclusive, and compact urban forms. These \nare desirable since they can easily be served by city-level transportation, promote \nwalkability, reduce environmental impacts, and enhance quality of life. Development of \ndense urban nodes around the HSR stations has been promoted to achieve a certain \ndesired urban form, as some of the central European cities are currently shrinking. These \ndevelopments are enabled by the public, as well as private, sectors who are willing to \ninvest, as well as the availability of large parcels of developable land near many station \nareas. However, a significant driver has been the brownfield sites \u2013 left empty in the \nwake of de-industrialization and the shift to a service economy \u2013 resulting in the structural \ntransformation of the whole region. \nSeeking to understand and measure the forces behind the intensification of station area \ndevelopment in the Netherlands, Bertolini (1998) elucidates the node-place dynamics of \nthe station area. He uses examples of different station areas around Dutch railway \nstations to form a model in which different station areas vary in their value as nodes and \nas places. In the Node-Place model (shown in Figure 4), the value of a station as a node \nis a function of the accessibility of the HSR station. However, value as a place is a \nfunction of the intensity and diversity of activities in the station area. \nNevertheless, the model clarifies the tremendous need for urban design considerations \nto be given to each station type \u2013 node or place, or both. The binary nature of station \nareas having to become nodes, catering to both transport and non-transport networks, \nand as places hosting diverse uses, generates a series of challenges. Bertolini and Spit \n(1998) identified five challenges: \n\u2022  Spatial challenges arise because of the compressed nature of most of the station \nsites.  These  challenges  may  paralyze  the  fluidity  required  for  passengers\u2019 \nintermodal  transfers,  as  well  as  other  users,  including  railway  staff.  The \ncumbersome  nature  of  railway  infrastructure  often  creates  a  barrier  effect \ndissecting the station from the area around it. However, unlike airports, railway \nstations may be integrated into dense urban contexts, forming nodes. \n14 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1040  Bharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n \n\u2022  Temporal challenges arise as urban redevelopment plans and investments in \ntransport  infrastructure  do  not  align  on  time  horizons.  Moreover,  with  the \ngenerally decade-long time frame of station area development, the projects \ngenerate  uncertainty.  Such  uncertainty  is  exceptionally  puzzling  for  public \nauthorities as well as private developers, delaying subsequent investments in the \nsurroundings. Unexpected fluctuations in the real estate markets can indirectly \naffect planning. \n\u2022  Functional challenges arise in setting up multifunctional environs, as HSR railway \nstations  act  as  both  transit  nodes  and  places  for  passengers  and  \nnon-travelers to move and or assemble. The complexity thus created by the \nm\u00e9lange of activities within a relatively tight area is challenging to address. \n\u2022  Financial challenges become a burden in the case of addressing technical \ndifficulties and including incompatible design requirements. Hence, the public \nsector often relies on private sector instruments, like the use of higher floor-area \nratios (FARs) or floor-space index (FSI) and the transfer of development rights \n(TDR) for intensifying the land use. Revenue from the tax is essential; this creates \nmore demand for commercial land use than other land-uses in the proximity of \nthe station. \n\u2022  Management challenges give rise to \u2018not in my backyard\u2019 issues and arguments. \nDue to the presence of public, private, and public\u2013private investments and \nproperties  in  and  around  the  station,  many  stakeholders  \nare  involved  in  and  are  responsible  for  maintenance.  Hence,  the  need  for \nstakeholder coordination is of paramount importance for operation and future \nplanning of the station, as well as the station area. \nFigure 4: Node-Place Model by Luca Bertolini (1998) \n \n5.3  The Good Station Area Plan \nThe earlier section elaborated on the fact that development within an HSR station and \nsurrounding  areas  is  crucial  and  challenging  in  inter-disciplinary  ways,  too.  What \ncontributes to proper HSR station area planning? \n15 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1040  Bharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n \nAs  the  previous  sections  have  highlighted,  HSR  station  areas  should  be  both \ntransportation  nodes  and  connector  places.  A  third  dimension  regarding  the \nsophisticated setting of a good station area consists of planning and policy factors. \nPlanning  and  policy  factors  result  in  an  envisioned  blend  of  facilities  around  the  \nstation.  Compatible  planning  and  urban  development  policies  can  achieve  good \nintermodal connections, better door-to-door services, and compact urban forms, by the \nconcentration of business, cultural, and entertainment activities.  \nJapan, after the introduction of the first HSR, has had the most extensive history of \nstation-adjacent developments (\u99c5\u524d\u958b\u767a). Learning from the station area development \ncases in Japan, Morichi (2013) suggests a decision-making process for station area \ndevelopment.  He  suggests  a  four-step  guideline  for  achieving  positive  impacts  of  \nhigh-speed rail on urban development in the form of station area development projects: \n\u2022  Developing a strategy for future urban structures based on the potential of the \nimpact on the region and formulating a master plan of the station area; \n\u2022  Select the target zone to be developed and decide on the types of incentives and \navailable or required regulation mechanisms; \n\u2022  Establish an institution for the development to be responsible for implementing \nthe zoning and land-use changes as per the target zone requirements; and \n\u2022  Implement the project as per by the master plan. \nThe above points demand an uncluttered understanding amongst the stakeholders. \nMoreover, the timing of the land development around the station overrides all other \ndecisions made during the project. Timing is critical for driving the relationship between \nthe demand for land and its price as soon as an HSR project is announced. Land prices \nare expected to be lower soon after the completion of the HSR project, even though they \nmight  be  higher  without  the  HSR  project.  This  means  that  the  cost  of  \nland development can be less expensive compared to delayed development in the \nstation area. \nSchutz (1998) (quoted and translated in Pol 2003) describes the development areas that \nmight  benefit  from  the  advent  of  an  HSR.  He  distinguished  the  areas  around  \nan  HSR  station  into  three  development  zones:  primary,  secondary,  and  tertiary \ndevelopment zones (see Table 1).  \nTable 1: Development Zones around an HSR Station \n \nPrimary  Secondary   Tertiary  \nDevelopment Zone  Development Zone  Development Zone \nAccessibility to and  Direct 5\u201310 min on  Indirect <15 min, by  Indirect >15 min, by \nfrom the HSR station  foot or by seamless  complementary transport  complementary \ntransport  modes (including travel  transport modes \nand transfer time)  (including travel and \ntransfer time) \nLocation potential  Location for high- Secondary location for  Variety of functions \ngrade (inter)national  high-grade functions.  depending on specific \nfunctions  Specialized functions  location factors \nrelated to specific location \n(cluster) \nBuilding density  Very high  High  Depends on specific \nsituation \nDevelopment dynamic  Very high  High  Modest \nSource: Schutz (1998). \n16 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1040  Bharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n \nSchutz affirms that the primary development zone, among all other zones, would receive \nand reflect the greatest effects of the advent of an HSR station. Because of the proximity \nto the HSR, the area profits directly from its improved status as a location. Therefore, in \nthe  primary  development  zone,  high-grade  office  and  residential  functions  can  be \nestablished, and within the same zone, land and real estate prices are expected to \nchange the most. As a result, to reap maximum benefits, high building density becomes \nan important aspect in the development of this area. Secondary development zones may \nalso establish high-grade functions, although the benefits in real estate will be less \ncompared to those of the primary development zone. The tertiary development zones \nmay  add  to  the  benefits  of  the  primary  development  zone  by  the  introduction  of \ncomplementary transport modes that would serve other areas in the urban region. The \ntertiary zone, however, is not likely to show any direct development effects that can be \nassociated with the arrival of HSR services. \nFigure 5: Three Development Zones around an HSR Station  \n \nSource: Schutz (1998), adapted from Pol (2002). \nFigure 6: Hub and Spoke Model of Station Area Development  \n \nSource: Oh (2013). \n   \n17 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1040  Bharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n \nAccording to Oh (2013), the KTX stations are emerging as the core of the regional \ndevelopment in the Republic of Korea. Station area development plans were prepared \nfor KTX stations. A hub-spoke model was adopted to increase station accessibility from \nthe surrounding areas (refer to Figures 5 and 6). The plans embedded intermodal \ntransport  center  complexes  (ITCCs),  which  both  combine  intermodal  transfer  and \nintegrate business and commercial activities within the station area, although, the station \ndevelopment projects have had some difficulties that resulted in inadequate returns from \ninvestment. First, there was a delay in the construction of the feeder transport system. \nSecond,  there  was  a  delay  in  development  due  to  lack  of  capability  \nof the project-executing agencies. Third, there were no rules or guidelines for the station \narea  development  (Sunduck  et  al.  2005).  The  integrated  coordination  of  all  the \nstakeholders is overly complicated and is very difficult to be adjusted, if not established \nbeforehand. \nIn a survey of HSR experts, Loukaitou-Sideris and colleagues (2011) summarize the \nessential preconditions found for station area development. The experts highlighted \nsome critical pre-conditions for the policymakers and other stakeholders to develop the \nHSR station areas. These include central station location, integration of the station with \nits surroundings, connectivity to the station, level of service, and strong political will and \nvision of the stakeholders. \n6.  SUMMARY \nHSR has been in operation for over 50 years in many countries. Within Asia itself, during \nthe  past  two  decades  several  corridors  have  been  developed  in  the  PRC  \nand countries like India, Viet Nam, and Thailand, and others are also planning and \nconstructing HSRs. The studies reviewed in the paper have argued that the effects  \nof transport infrastructure investments on the location are subject to externalities. In spite \nof  such  growth  in  the  HSR  networks,  the  doubts  of  the  potentials  of  the  HSR \ninfrastructure have not been fully dispelled. While the potential effects of HSR can be \nlong-ranging and multitudinous. Such challenges include building alternative resources \nthat are required to elicit benefits from the spillovers of mega-infrastructure projects. \nThis paper outlines the global experience of HSR and concludes that HSR brings in \nconsiderable socio-economic benefits that cannot be captured through econometric \nmodelling alone. Capturing the impacts of HSR infrastructure requires analysis involving \na  scaler  as  well  as  a  temporal  lens.  Impacts  of  infrastructure  on  quality  of  \nlife vary with the scale of development and time required to achieve the expected \nimpacts. This paper shows that HSR may become a core infrastructure for desired urban \ndevelopments and \u2013 at the same time \u2013 may also lead to undesirable outcomes. \nIn terms of scale, first \u2013 at the regional level \u2013 the HSR network changes the accessibility \nof  a  locality.  Better  accessibility  will  change  the  mobility  patterns  and  \nwill  eventually  affect  the  development  in  the  impact  region,  reshaping  the  entire  \nurban-regional system. Countries developing an HSR network need to rigorously plan \nthe  path  to  elicit  maximum  benefits  while  investing  in  HSR  infrastructure.  This  is \nparticularly important in the case of countries with an elaborate city system. Countries \nlike  India,  Thailand,  and  Indonesia  need  to  understand  their  metropolis  formation \nprocesses. Understanding the current system of cities may aid in planning HSR routes \nto redistribute the urban functions from one region to another, in order to attain a \nbalanced regional development. \n   \n18 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1040  Bharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n \nSecond, at the urban scale, the HSR is expected to play a catalyzing role to drive the \nspatial and urban transformation processes. The paper emphasizes the importance of \nestablishing a cooperation between HSR and urban and local development. A synergy \nbetween HSR and other elements, like urban transit-paratransit facilities, station area \ndevelopment, and sub-center development, would radically increase the spillover effects \n(Bharule 2019a). Increased accessibility to services and the convenience of travelling \nthereby enhance the overall quality of life in the city. This has been a common experience \namong all HSR-operating countries. Achieving such cooperation demands innovation in \ninstitutional arrangements across all the relevant elements to deliver enhanced livability \nin an urban space. \nThird, this paper also draws attention to the importance of station area development \nplanning and its relationship with HSR stations. The discussion elucidates the multiple \ncharacteristics and overlapping factors associated with station area development, while \nnoting  that these  complexities  collectively  lead  to  the  formation  of  a  station  area. \nDevelopment in the station surroundings usually takes more than a decade, and a robust \nstrategy and long-term vision are therefore necessary from the outset of the project \n(Seetharam and Bharule 2019). A vision for long-term integrated development demands \nfor a policy framework that gives equal importance to all the members, stakeholders, and \nactors.  However,  varying  governmental  setups  and  frameworks  of  infrastructure \nadoption present several challenges in setting up an egalitarian policy framework, \nespecially in emerging economies, where these policy challenges are sensitive to local \ncontext. \nLast, an HSR corridor is beneficial both to the cities and towns along the corridor and the \nrailway operator. To the cities and towns, HSR serves as a form of urban amenity that is \ncrucial to accelerating their economic growth and improving the quality of life. For the \nrailways, station areas provide an important opportunity to harness revenue through non-\nrailway businesses (Bharule 2019b). Realizing the full development effects of an HSR \nproject may take decades. Therefore, careful planning and coordination among the \nstakeholders is a necessity to accomplish a set of phased goals. Although evidence \nsuggests that the introduction of HSR services is largely associated with the service \nsector, the spillover of the economic activities and transport infrastructure generates \nimplications for local as well as regional spatial development strategies, enhancing the \nquality of life at all levels. \n   \n19 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1040  Bharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n \nREFERENCES \nAmos, P., Bullock, D., and Sondhi, J.

We summarize the evolution of HSR and elaborate on the development effects of the HSR transport infrastructure. HSR can simultaneously become a core component on desired urban developments, while also having undesirable outcomes. Positive impacts will be achieved only if interactions with other factors and contexts are maintained. We stratify and expand the understanding of the development effects of HSR at three levels - regional, urban, and station area \u2013 based on the economic and temporal nature of all infrastructure projects. There is ample evidence that at the regional level, the implementation of an HSR service disrupts the existing network of cities along the proposed corridor. The HSR network changes the accessibility of a locality. Better accessibility will change the mobility patterns and will eventually affect the development in the impacted region, reshaping the entire urban-regional system. The HSR is expected to play a catalyzing role in driving the spatial and urban transformation process. We emphasize the importance of establishing a synergy between HSR and urban development. A synergy between HSR and other elements, like urban transit facilities, paratransit, station area development, node, and sub-center development, can usher in spatial and economic development, but an institutional arrangement across all the elements is of paramount importance. Such a synergy would enhance livability and provide improved quality of life opportunities in cities and regions served by HSR.", "Title": "Evolution of High-Speed Rail and Its Development Effects: Stylized Facts and Review of Relationships"}}
