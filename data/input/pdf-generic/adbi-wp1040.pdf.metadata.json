DEFINING HIGH-SPEED RAILWAY AND ITS STATUS \n\nTHROUGHOUT THE WORLD \n\nSince the origin of railways in Great Britain in the early 19th century, \u2018high-speed\u2019 has \nbeen a time-relative concept. The 56 km Liverpool-Manchester Railway was the world\u2019s \nfirst  passenger  railway  developed  for  intercity  transport.  The  50km/h  speed  record \nachieved  by  the  steam-powered  \u2018Rocket\u2019  locomotive  in  1830  represented  a  truly  high \nspeed for its time. Soon, with the change in technology, passenger rail travel would see \ntremendous upgrades in speed. The German diesel trains achieved 215km/h in 1939; \nFrench electric-powered TGV holds the current record on steel rails at 574km/h (set in \n2007).  More  recently,  the  magnetic  levitation  Chuo  Shinkansen  of  Japan  achieved  \n603 km/h on a test track in Central Japan. \n\nIn  rail  transport,  trains  that  use  specialized  rolling  stock  and  operate  at  more  than  \n250  km/h  on  new  dedicated  lines  and  200  km/h  or  220  km/h  on  upgraded  lines  are \naccepted as HSR, as per the International Union of Railways (UIC 2008), although there \nis no single standard definition of HSR. In order to provide a non-speed related definition, \nCampos and de Rus (2009) reviewed the technical and economic characteristics of 166 \nHSR  lines  in  20  countries.  Examining  various  lines  \u2013  based  on  the  infrastructure, \ndevelopment costs, operation costs, and forecasted demand \u2013 the authors distinguish \nfour  HSR  network  types,  namely,  the  exclusive  exploitation  type,  mixed  speed  type, \nconventional mixed type, and thoroughly mixed type. The description makes it clear that \nHSR is a combination of various infrastructural elements, which together form a single, \nintegrated system and should be observed as a complete system. Figure 1 compares \nthe planned and currently operational HSR corridors across the world (Bharule 2019a).  \n\n1.1  Japan \n\nJapan  is  the  pioneer  in  introducing  the  HSR  to  the  world.  The  first  HSR  link  in  the \nJapanese  Rail  network  came  into  commercial  service  in  1964,  connecting  Tokyo  to \nOsaka.  Known  as  the  Shinkansen  (\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda),  meaning  \u2018new  trunk  line,\u2019  the  515.4  km \nTokaido line corridor was built in a linear geographic setting that was apt for rail travel, \nwith a primary goal of expanding the capacity on an overcrowded route. Takatsu (2007) \npoints out that the design of the Tokaido line alignment attempted to use existing railway \nstations  through  many  cities  along  the  corridor  served  by  new  stations.  The  author \nhighlights that after the first speed upgrade from 210 km/hr to 270 km/hr in 1992, the \ntravel  time  was  reduced  to  3  hours  and  10  minutes,  making  Tokyo\u2013Osaka  day  trips \nfeasible. \n\n1.2  Republic of Korea \n\nThe Republic of Korea's Seoul\u2013Busan axis is the primary passenger and freight traffic \ncorridor. The National Rail operator introduced the Korail Express (KTX) HSR service in \n2004. The KTX service has shrunk the inter-city travel time to fewer than three hours. \nThis  has  not  only  changed  commuting  habits  and  lifestyles,  but  it  has  also  had  a \nsignificant  social,  economic,  and  cultural  impact  (Terabe  et  al.  n.d.).  Since  the \nintroduction of KTX, the number of rail passengers has increased, alongside a significant \ndecrease in the number passengers opting for private cars, express buses, and aircraft \nto travel along the same route. The national government aims to expand the KTX network \nand reduce the road usage to the extent that it is possible to reach any part of the country \nwithin 1 hour and 30 minutes (The Chosun Ilbo 2010). \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1040 \n \n\nBharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n\nFigure 1: Comparison of Global High-Speed Rail Corridor Length \n\n \n\nSource: Adapted from Bharule (2019a). \n\n1.3  Taipei,China \n\nPlans  for  Taipei,China\u2019s  first  HSR  corridor  came  to  light  in  1989.  The  plan  aimed  \nto  tackle  the  growing  issues  in  managing  the  congestion  between  Taipei,China\u2019s  \ntwo  largest  cities.  The  THSRC,  HSR  Corporation  operates  345  km  of  HSR  between \nTaipei,China  in  the  north,  to  Kaohsiung  in  the  south.  Valued  at  $13  billion  at  the  \ntime of implementation, the project was one of the world\u2019s largest privately funded railway \nconstruction projects. Under the Station Zone Development Agreement, the government \ngranted the rail corporation a 50-year concession to develop the land surrounding the \nstations  for  commercial,  residential,  and  recreational  purposes  (Terabe  et  al.  2013). \nAlthough  the  project  started  without  much  delay,  the  ridership  count  was  lower  than \nexpected. The government revived the debt-ridden company, introducing new operations \nand management structure. The Government of Taipei,China is a major stakeholder in \nthe  THSRC,  but  the  company  operations  are  privately  managed  (Chen  2018).  The \noperator expects an increase in ridership after the opening of more stations on the line \nin the near future. \n\n1.4  People\u2019s Republic of China \n\nThe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) leads the world in terms of HSR line length. The \nMid-to-Long Term Railway Network Plan, laid out for Horizon 2020 and adopted by the \ngovernment in 2004, was updated in 2008. Under this plan, the Beijing\u2013Tianjin HSR was \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1040 \n \n\nBharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n\nfirst of a new generation of HSR, opened in August 2008 with a maximum speed of 350 \nkm/hour. High density corridors, like Beijing\u2013Shanghai and Beijing\u2013Guangzhou, have a \ndesign speed of 350 km/hr, one of the highest in the world, while several other corridors \nwith  more  modest  passenger  volumes  have  a  maximum  design  speed  of  \n250 km/hour. Generally, both of these types of HSR projects in the PRC are passenger-\ndedicated lines (PDL) and green-field projects (UIC 2008). At the end of December 2013, \nmost of the metropolitan regions in the PRC were either connected, or in the process of \nbeing  connected,  to  lines  with  a  maximum  speed  of  200  km/hour  or  higher  (Ollivier, \nSondhi, and Zhou 2014). \n\nThe PRC\u2019s HSR network is expected to span 30,000 km by 2020. This expansion will \nhelp in connecting 80% of PRC cities by creating eight corridors, each from north to south \nand  east  to  west.  This  network  configuration  is  envisioned  to  revitalize  many \neconomically  challenged  cities  in  west  and  central  PRC,  because  of  the  hub  effect \ncreated  by  the  HSR  system,  especially  at  junctions  (Li  et  al.  2016).  With  increasing \npassenger  flow  and  accessibility,  cities  on  HSR  lines  are  becoming  strategically \nimportant targets for industries, such as hotels, catering, logistics, and real estate. While \nregional  economic  differences  are  not  rare  in  a  global  economy,  the  PRC\u2019s  regional \ndifferences are by far the most disparate of any in the world (Amos, Bullock, and Sondhi \n[2010]; Ollivier et al. [2014]). \n\n1.5  Europe \n\nThe first HSR lines in Europe were built around the 1980s. By connecting important cities, \nthey  improved  the  travel  time  on  intra-national  corridors.  Private  operators  operate \nalmost  all  lines  in  the  European  Union  (EU),  and  they  receive  EU  funding.  \nThe  EU  Council  Directive  of  1996  specifically  aimed  to  achieve  interoperability  of  \nHigh-Speed  Trains.1 This  cross-border  infrastructure  promotion  was  the  part  of  larger \nTrans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T), which are a part of wider Trans-European \nNetworks  (TENs)  envisioned  by  the  EU  in  1990.  The  wider  system  of  TENs  includes \ntransportation, telecommunication, and a proposed energy network spread across the \nEU. \n\n1.6  France \n\nFrance was the first European country to start HSR services in 1981. The TGV service \nbetween Paris and Lyon has a duration of 2 hours and covers for 450 km, as part of a \nstrategy to decongest the overly congested conventional routes. A dedicated HSR line \nwas  adopted,  and  the  terminals  were  integrated  with  the  existing  stations.  While \nconverging  all  the  lines  toward  Paris,  the  French  government  strategically  developed \nmore profitable lines first. In recent years, the observed regional development in terms \nof  social  returns  was  higher  than  expected. 2 Such  an  initiative  has  encouraged  the \ngovernment to contribute to the construction costs and further expand the network.3 \n\n \n\n1   EU Law.

As in the case \nof  Japan,  the  incompatible  Spanish  rail  gauge  made  it  necessary  to  overlay  a  new \nstandard  gauge  line  (Givoni  2006).  The  first  line  was  progressively  extended  and \nconnected to Barcelona. As a part of an EU Commission to develop an extended Trans-\nEuropean  Network  (TEN),  the  Spanish  network  was  connected  to  the  French  railway \nnetwork in 2012.4 In 2010, Spain developed the largest HSR network in Europe. With \nthe population concentration around the coast and Madrid in the center of the country, \nSpain developed a radial railway network. Currently, with over 3,200 km of HSR lines, \nSpain\u2019s network is second to the PRC HSR network. \n\n1.6.2  Germany \n\nDeutsche Bahn, the German railway company, started its first railway service, InterCity \nExpress (ICE), in 1991. The ICE network is designed to connect many major cities and \nhubs  within  Germany  and  in  the  neighboring  countries  of  France,  the  Netherlands, \nSwitzerland,  Denmark,  Belgium,  and  Austria  (Sands  1993).  German  ICE  services are \nused for short to medium distances between the cities, and lines operate at speeds of \n200 km/hr and 250 km/hr (UIC 2008). \n\n1.6.3  Italy \n\nItaly  partially  began  its  first  dedicated  HSR  in  1978,  while  a  254  km  \u2018direttissima\u2019  line \nconnecting Rome and Florence was under construction. The line was completed in 1992. \nWith the introduction of direttissima lines, the travel time between the main Italian cities \nhas  been  progressively  reduced  (Desmaris  2016).  Infrastructure  in  Italy  follows  the \ncountry\u2019s geography, and the HSR lines are oriented in a north-south perspective, with \nthe greatest density in the north. Italian HSR is an exception in Europe, as the distance \nbetween the cities is shorter compared to other countries, and Italian HSR lines operate \nat different speed levels. A comparison of the operational speed of all HSR lines across \nthe world is shown in Figure 2 (Bharule 2019a). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4   Railway Gazette. (2011).

COUNTRIES CURRENTLY DEVELOPING  \n\nHSR INFRASTRUCTURE \n\n2.1  India \n\nIn  early  2010,  the  Ministry  of  Railways  of  the  government  of  India  announced  \u2013  in  its \n\u2018Vision  2020\u2019  \u2013  seven  HSR  lines  connecting  several  cities  in  distinct  parts  of  \nthe country. A 508 km HSR line connecting Mumbai and Ahmedabad along western India \nwill be the first in development. In 2015, India and Japan entered into a \u2018Memorandum \nof  Cooperation  on  High-Speed  Railways.\u2019  Under  the  agreement,  the  Mumbai \nAhmedabad High-Speed Rail will adopt Japanese Shinkansen Technology. Adopting a \ndedicated  track  configuration,  the  line  is  envisioned  to  decongest  India\u2019s  busiest \npassenger railway corridor. The project is estimated to be operational by late December \n2023 and to cost $16 billion funded by Official Development Aid (ODA) from the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency. \n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1040 \n \n\n2.2  Indonesia \n\nBharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n\nThe  Java  HSR  project  is  planned  to  connect  the  densely  populated  region  between  \nthe national capital Jakarta and the second-largest city, Surabaya, which are located 730 \nkm apart on the Indonesian island of Java. As a part of the PRC\u2019s Belt Road Initiative, a \n150 km initial phase of the rail link is envisioned to be operational by early 2021. After \nseveral rounds of proposals and bidding since 2008, the project was finally awarded to \nis  being  developed  at  an  estimated  cost  of  \nthe  PRC \n$5.5  billion  for  the  first phase  connecting  Jakarta  to  Kertajati-International  Airport,  the \nsecond-largest airport in Indonesia, near Bandung city. \n\nin  2015,  and \n\nit \n\n2.3  Thailand \n\nThe  Government  of  Thailand  approved  five  HSR  lines  in  late  2010.  Although  the  \nstatus of all lines varies, all the planned 1500 km network converges in Bangkok, the \ncapital  city  of  Thailand.  The  network  will  be  developed  in  several  stages  and  it  is \nenvisioned to be complete by 2036, with the earliest operation beginning in 2021. The \ncomplete network inclusive of airport links is estimated to cost $30 billion. The Thai HSR \nnetwork is developed as ODA projects, with two lines awarded each to Japan and the \nPRC, while the fifth line is still in the proposal stage. In addition to the network, a 220 km \ncorridor of airport link HSR is under development as a part of the Thai Eastern Economic \nCorridor  (EEC)  Project.  Under  the  EEC  project,  the  airport  link  is  proposed  \nto  connect  three  international  airports  between  Bangkok  and  Pattaya.  Developed  \nunder  a  Sino-Thai  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  consortium,  the  project  is  due  to \nopen in 2024. \n\n3.  HSR AND ITS EFFECTS \n\nSince the early 1900 Japan has been the pioneer in railway operations and integrated \nland  development  (De  Souza,  Ochi,  and  Hosono  [2018]).  A  consistent  incremental \nimprovement  in  the  integrated  land  development  practices  has  resulted  in  economic \ndevelopment  of  the  cities  served  by  the  Shinkansen  corridors,  suggesting  an  inter-\ndependence  of  implementation  and  the  planning  process.  Over  time,  services  and \nindustries  agglomerated  along  the  first  Shinkansen  corridor,  established  nodes  with \nconnecting transit facilities in cities like Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka, which have emerged \nas prominent hubs (RIDA and OECF 1995). \n\nThe Republic of Korea has followed the Japanese integrated model of development, but \nhas required additional efforts in integrating regional public transport to the KTX corridors \nand  stations  to  enhance  revenue.  With  the  fast  mobility  of  KTX,  a  new  form  \nof the national economy was born. International conferences could now be held at places \nother than Seoul. The added accessibility attracted almost 10,000 people to connected \ncities from the Seoul capital area (KOTI 2015). This population shift was unprecedented \nin the country\u2019s history. The integration of public transit with KTX is underway around \nhub stations (Lee 2014). \n\nThe  case  of  THSRC,  an  HSR  corporation  in  Taipei,China,  is  unique.  After  becoming \nalmost  bankrupt,  the  company  has  resurrected  itself  in  the  past  ten  years  by  making \nmeticulous efforts to streamline the operations and sustainability of HSR. Reorganizing \nthe  company\u2019s  operations  management;  improving  stakeholder  relationships;  and \nestablishing  station-to-city-center  bus  services,  which  increased  ridership,  resulted  in \nsteady revenue growth (Chen 2018). \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1040 \n \n\nBharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n\nThis countrywide discourse makes it clear that it takes more than a decade to establish \na thriving HSR corridor, and that the methods to achieve success can be different. \n\n3.1  Temporal Effects of HSR \n\nHSR  systems  are  built  to  reinforce  accessibility  and  strengthen  inter-regional,  as  \nwell  as  intra-regional,  relations.  HSR  corridors  are  set  between  pairs  of  cities,  which \nushers  in  a  paradigm  shift  for  inter-regional  mobility,  boosting  the  national  economy. \nEmpirical  data  analysis  of  HSR\u2019s  impact  in  Japan  and  other  countries  shows  the  \ndirect  impacts  of  salient  features  of  HSR,  like  savings  in  travel  time,  safety,  comfort, \npunctuality, and frequency of trains, which are significant in terms of increased business \nactivity and productivity. With the increased accessibility to better markets, it is possible \nfor businesses located in one region to explore national and international opportunities, \nwhich would previously have been accessible only to businesses located in capital cities. \n\n3.2  Immediate Effects \n\nHSR contributes significantly to saving in travel time, comfort, and safety. For 400\u2013700 \nkm distances, HSR is the preferred mode of travel over automobiles and planes. Since \nthe inauguration of the first Shinkansen line, the intercity travel time has reduced by over \n50% in Japan. Technological innovations have helped in upgrading top-speed and train \ncar  safety,  assuring  increased  frequency  and  improving  the  ride  quality  (KOTI  2015). \nHSR competes with roadways and airlines, not just because of the change in share, but \nalso the total travel time, including access and egress, with the added comfort and travel \nsafety. \n\n3.3  Medium-Term Effects \n\nA city is a complex geographic setting with inter-linked functions. Urban life in a city is \nextremely  intertwined,  and  interdependencies  of  networks  of  activities  are  endless.  \nAn HSR line is one such link connecting and creating important hubs in the cities through \nwhich it travels. Yoshino and Abidhadjaev (2016) analyze the effects of linking cities with \nan HSR in the case of Kyushu Shinkansen in Japan. The Shinkansen line construction \nstarted  in  1991.  It  was  partly  operational  until  2004,  and  in  2011,  it  became  fully \noperational. During construction, the land price and the property tax revenue increased \nin municipalities around HSR stations. However, the trend around each station varied \nafter the opening of the line. \n\n4.  HIGH-SPEED RAIL AND DEVELOPMENT \n\n4.1  HSR and Regional Spillover of Development \n\nthrough  academic  work  emphasizes \n\nEvidence \ninter-region  HSR \ninvestments,  they  can  create  regional  imbalances.  When  HSR  investments  are  made \nwhere  the  city  or  region  pairs  have different  levels  of  development,  such  investments \nmay work in favor of primate regions and cities at the expense of weaker surrounding \nregions.5 \n\ninter-city  and \n\n5   A primate city distribution is a rank-size distribution that has one very large city with many much smaller \n\ncities and towns, and no intermediate-sized urban centers. \n\n \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1040 \n \n\nBharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n\nAlong  a  proposed  corridor,  cities  that  will  have  access  to  HSR  through  a  station  may \naccrue benefits, although the distribution of impacts and gains requires rigorous study. \nCities  of  regional  importance  might  benefit  at  the  sacrifice  of  neighboring  hinterlands, \nthereby  yielding  certain  impacts,  although  various  research  has  argued  that  countries \nwith dominant cities tend to accumulate net benefits. \n\nUnder the umbrella term of \u2018New Economic Geography\u2019 (NEG), Krugman (1991) explains \nthe prolonged existence of regional disparities. Krugman emphasizes the advantages for \nhigher  productivity  gains  developed  due  to  the  agglomeration  of  economic  activity  in \nmajor cities, which attracts organizations and labor. NEG is a theoretical framework for \nunderstanding  the  economic  processes  that  produce  regional  inequalities  (Tomaney \n2012a).  The  theory  explains  the  choice  of  location  of  individual  businesses  as  an \noutcome of a trade-off between increasing returns to scale and optimum transportation \ncosts (Krugman 1999). \n\nNEG establishes itself as an important principle, although it fails to explain the preference \nof  an  organization  to  relocate  in  urban  areas,  where  costs  of  establishment  are \nsignificantly higher compared to peripheral hinterlands. A city is the resultant product of \nlocalization or agglomeration economies. The concentration of organizations and firms \nin  specialized  clusters  is  understood  as  \u2018localization,\u2019  whereas  the  presence  of \norganizations and firms in cities and urban areas with a diversified economy is referred \nto as \u2018agglomeration\u2019. Fujita and Krugman (2003) conclude that the combination of the \nbenefits of agglomeration and localization  in the form of scale economies, labor pool, \nand knowledge spillover collectively explains the \u2018pull effect\u2019 of urban locations on firms. \n\nFurther  detailing  the  transport  cost  and  regional  economic  relationship,  Lafourcade  \nand  Thisse  (2011)  point  out  that  core  regions  are  more  likely  to  benefit  through  \nreduced transport costs, although these benefits will involve disservice to poorer regions. \nAgglomeration economies generate positive externalities, which are mutually reinforcing. \nTherefore,  city  regions  and  their  surroundings  are  likely  to  create  a  more  competitive \nbusiness environment, resulting in higher overall productivity. As a result, when firms and \nbusinesses  located  in  the  core  of  the  region  are  competing  with  those  located  in  the \nperiphery of the region, the former has an advantage over the latter. \n\ntransport \n\nNevertheless, a prevailing assumption states that the impact of transport cost reductions \non the regional economies follows a bell curve (Tomaney 2012a). Tracking the timeline \nof \n(2016)  clarify  \ninfrastructure,  Rodrigue,  Comtois,  and  Slack \nthat  the  concentration  of  certain  economic  activities  in  the  immediate  agglomerations \nmay  in  fact  be  a  result  of  lowered  transportation  costs.  Lower  transportation  costs  \ntend to expedite redistribution of economic activity, especially toward the periphery. This \nis  particularly  true  for  manufacturing  activities.  However,  this  would  imply  that \ntransportation  costs  become  almost  negligible,  which  might  not  be  the  case.  In  such \ncases, the centrally located peripheral region supports the connected region. \n\nExamining the trends in regional inequalities in the EU, Puga (2002) focuses on regional \ndisparities. He notes that connectivity augmentation between regions of different levels \nof  development  not  only  allows  the  less  developed  region  to  have  access  to  better \nmarkets located in the more developed regions, but it also makes it easier for firms in \ndeveloped  regions  to  supply  more  impoverished  areas.  This  added  advantage  may \ndirectly harm the industrialization prospects of areas with lower development levels, and \nthe result may directly affect the environment as well as the quality of life of individuals \n(Hayashi et al. 2015; Rothengatter et al. 2015). \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1040 \n \n\nBharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n\nHighlighting the importance of NEG models, Puga stresses that they not only point out \nthe potential ambiguity of reductions in transport costs on less developed regions. The \nmodels also clarify that the overall effects depend not just on the characteristics of the \ntransportation  infrastructure  projects,  but  also  on  specific  aspects  of  the  economic \nenvironment where the project is implemented \u2013 for instance, among two regions to be \nconnected  by  new  transport  infrastructure  and  if  the  difference  in  wages  and  inter-\nregional migration are low, and the regions differ widely in terms of the attractiveness to \nbusiness services. \n\nThe investment in the new transport infrastructure can do very little to reduce the regional \ninequalities. Puga (2002) argues that the potential impact of HSR is primarily focused on \nbusinesses and the location of headquarters. Puga suggests that HSR services give an \nadded advantage for business service providers to serve remote locations and access \nthe headquarters at the same time, which leads to a further concentration of businesses \nin a few large cities. A resultant effect is higher tariffs in cities, making them less attractive \nfor manufacturing firms to relocate. The rise in tariff accelerates the transformation in the \neconomic  geography  from  sectorally  specialized  regions  to  functionally  specialized \nregion (Bharule 2019a). \n\nOn  the  emergence  of  the  trend  described  above,  Duranton  and  Puga  (2001)  draw \nevidence from France. After the construction of the TGV between Paris and Lyon, the \nTGV investment led to the relocation of business headquarters from Lyon to Paris. This \nmovement  contrasted  with  the  government's  claims  of  new  commercial  development \nalong  Part-Dieu  station  in  Lyon,  an  indicator  of  the  positive  effects  of  HSR.  Although \nthere was no mention of net impacts on growth and employment, this points to a negative \nnet impact for the city of Lyon. \n\nthan  good  \u2013  especially \n\nDifferentiating  the  types  of  ail  investments,  Puga  (2002)  concludes  that  inter-regional \ninvestment  facilitates  trade  between  regions,  and  intra-regional  investment  facilitates \ntrade within regions. Puga concludes that improvements in the inter-region infrastructure \nmay  causes  more  harm \nregions  \n\u2013 whereas intra-regional improvements appear to have no negative impacts. Similarly, \nhub-and-spoke type HSR network systems appear to produce different effects on their \nsurroundings. In a multiple spoke network, where several of the spokes or rail corridors \nare  connected  to  a  single  hub  or  city  core,  this  tends  to  promote  agglomeration  in  \nthe  hub.  Businesses  and  firms  located  at  the  hub  will  face  lower  transport  costs  to  \nany  end  of  the  spoke  than  firms  going  from  one  spoke  to  another.  Moreover,  hub \nlocations would tend to trigger inequalities among spoke regions (Duranton and Puga \n2000, 2005, 2014, 2015; Fujita, Krugman, and Mori 1999; Fujita and Mori 1996, 2005; \nPuga 1999). \n\nto  peripheral \n\nHighlighting  the  ambiguity  in  the  results  of  the  impact  assessment  of  HSR  projects,  \nde  Rus  (2009)  concludes  that  impact  assessment  using  NEG  models  to  ascertain  \nthe  potential  impact  of  lower  transport  costs  on  less  developed  regions  remains \nundetermined. Furthermore, the overall effect on the region would also depend on the \neconomic environment and the characteristics of the transport projects. In this regard, \nthe TEN-T has resulted in developing better accessibility in most of the economic centers \nacross  the  EU.  However,  the  \u2018time-space  convergence\u2019  due  to  the  new  infrastructure \nmay widen the relative accessibility gap between the urban core and the periphery. The \nemphasis  on  HSR  links  is  likely  to  favor  the  central  and  terminal  nodes  of  the  HSR \nsystem network and is not likely to promote the development of new activity centers in \nminor nodes or intermediate locations (de Rus 2008). The accessibility gap widens with \neach added HSR service, thus augmenting inequality in regions and reinforcing the core \nregions as transport hubs (Puga 2002). \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1040 \n \n\nBharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n\nOn the contrary, Rodr\u00ecguez-Pose and Fratesi (2002) argue that the effects on regional \nconvergence  were  barely  noticeable,  in  spite  of  investments  in  new  roads,  freeways, \nexpressways,  and  high-speed  rail  proposed  under  the  TEN-T  project  masterplan. \nSignificant returns were visible only in the case of education and human capital. They \nconsider several potential reasons for this, but they conclude that the primary reason for \nthe  disappointing  performance  and  low  returns  is  the  weak  relationships  between \ninfrastructure investments and regional convergence. \n\nHighlighting  the  bi-directional  nature  of  transport  and  telecommunication  links,  they \nemphasize  the  formulation  of  a  strategy  with  a  strong  understanding  of  the  regional \ncharacteristics,  which  must  act  as  a  root  of  all  the  infrastructure  development  in  the \nregion.  They  further  explain  that  providing  various  activities  around  the  investment \ncorridor may resolve a vital block in development while reducing the gap in infrastructural \ndemand with the rest of Europe (Rodr\u00edguez-Pose and Fratesi [2004]; Tomaney [2012]). \nHowever, such a policy may expose the weaker regions to competition from stronger and \nmore technologically advanced businesses located in the core cities, causing more harm \nthan benefit. \n\n5.  HSR AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT \n\nEmpirical evidence through academic work emphasizes that HSR investments become \na catalyst for urban restructuring. Extensive research focuses on one concern: \u2018Location \nof the HSR station with respect to the City Center.\u2019 The HSR-urban interaction can result \nin a boon for urban development. Studying the HSR station location typologies in Europe \n(see Figure 3), Hall (2009) identified three types of urban impacts of HSR depending on \nthe location of the station: \n\n\u2022  The first type is when the station is located beside or within the traditional Central \nBusiness District (CBD). This improves or reinforces the CBD\u2019s attraction as a \nplace for commercial investment. \n\n\u2022  The  second  type  of  station  is  usually  located  on  the  edges  of  cities,  adjacent  \nto,  but  separate  from,  the  major  urban  centers.  This  helps  in  developing \ncomplementary sub-centers within the urban area. \n\n\u2022  The third type of station uses the station as a driver for a new commercial \u2018edge \n\ncity\u2019 on the periphery of the urban area. \n\nThe  latter  two  types  may  help  in  promoting  the  transformation  of  a  mono-centric  city  \nto a poly-centric urban region. Priemus (2008) clarifies that having an HSR station away \nfrom  the  city  center  helps  in  the  development  of  more  nodes  and  urban  centers  by \nconnecting  the  urban  patterns  and  infrastructure  network  together.  Discussing  the \ndevelopment  of  the  European  high-speed  rail  network,  Vickerman,  Spiekermann,  and \nWegener (1999) demonstrate accessibility improvement for hub cities in the EU, whereas \nless  \nperipheral  cities  have  gained  some \nthan hub cities. Nodal cities gain the most from improvements to the high-speed network, \nwhile places between the nodes or on the edge of the network do not make significant \ngains. \n\nimproved  accessibility,  but  still \n\n \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1040 \n \n\nBharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n\nFigure 3: Types of HSR Station Location with Respect to CBD and Urban Fabric  \n\nSource: Hall (2009). \n\n \n\nThe HSR-urban interaction should be observed at an urban-regional level. The advent \nof  HSR  plays  two  roles  in  influencing  the  urban  economy:  a  catalyzing  role  and  a \nfacilitating role. The HSR network plays a catalyzing role by drawing new activities to the \nurban  region,  and  a  facilitating  role  by  impacting  the  cities  in  terms  of  accessibility  to \nenhance the local economy (van den Berg and Pol 1998). However, the major challenges \nthat loom in the landscape of development adjacent to HSR stations include managing \nthe  competition  and  dynamics  between  the  old  and  new  station  areas,  nodes,  and \ncenters and to blend the new development with the existing urban fabric (Yin, Bertolini, \nand Duan 2015). \n\n5.1  Characteristics of HSR Station Area Development Projects  \n\nHSR  station  areas  have  been  described  in  various  texts  using  several  characteristics \nand indicators. Terrin, Marie, and Leheis (2011) highlighted the characteristics of HSR \ndevelopment  projects  in  the  European  cities  of  Barcelona,  Lille,  Lyon,  Marseille, \nRotterdam, and Turin. They argue that HSR stations may be on their way to becoming a \nnew  architectural  typology:  a  new  kind  of  mobility  infrastructure  that  is  a  hybrid  of  an \nairport hub and a service-oriented shopping space, while still being a multi-cultural public \nspace at the same time. The highlighted characteristics described are primarily based \non two models: transport infrastructure-led economic development, and a network model \nconnecting  local  and  global  hubs  while  producing  mobility-induced  services  (Terrin \n2016). \n\nReviewing  the  urban  development  impacts  induced  by  HSR,  Sands  (1993)  presents \nempirical  evidence  from  Shinkansen  in  Japan,  the  TGV  in  France,  and  the  ICE  in \nGermany. He focused on the change in travel time and urban economic impacts, such \nas demographic changes, as well as station area development and redevelopment. At \nthe  local  level,  his  analysis  categorized  the  station  in  two  types:  first,  HSR  that  was \nintroduced into existing conventional rail stations and, second, new stations exclusively \nbuilt for HSR. At a regional level, he compared stations by looking at stations where only \nexpress HST stopped in comparison with those served by slow HSTs, which stopped at \nall the stations. \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1040 \n \n\nBharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n\nBerg and Pol (1998) propose two groups of cities in the European context: international \nservice  cities  and  cities  in  transition.  They  pointed  out  that  international  service  cities \nsuch as London, Paris, Barcelona, Amsterdam, and Lyon have a competitive edge in the \ninternational  service  and  knowledge  economy,  and,  because  of  their  international \nfacilities, attractiveness, and accessibility, they compete to be global players. The cities \nin transition, such as Lille, Liverpool, Marseilles, Rotterdam, and Turin are often old port \nor  industrial  cities  seeking  to  transform  and  boost  their  economy  by  attracting  new \neconomic activities and inhabitants through investments. Both groups of cities see the \nHSR station as an opportunity to attract more business activity and commercial and real \nestate land development in and around the station area (Pol 1998). However, not all the \nstation area developments observed were similar. For instance, Peters and Novy (2012, \n2013)  analyzed  cases  in  Europe  and  identified  four  distinct  categories  of  train  station \narea development: \n\n\u2022  Station  Renaissance  Projects:  These  were  focused  on  the  redevelopment  of \nstation facilities, such as the restoration and expansion of historic stations. Some \nstations also enhance the shopping and entertainment facilities within the station \npremises. \n\n\u2022  Transport  Development  Projects:  The  primary  goal  of  these  projects  is  to \nenhance  the  transportation  infrastructure  and  improve  the  transfers  between \ndifferent modes available at the station. \n\n\u2022  Strategic Mega-Projects: They involve significant and large-scale development in \nthe  vicinity  of  a  railway  station,  and  they  require  the  active  involvement  of \nstakeholders in both public and private investment. \n\n\u2022  Urban Development Projects: The redevelopment of the railway station and its \nsurroundings  must  be  conducted  under  as  single,  integrated  master  plan. \nComplementarity in-land use while master planning of the station surroundings is \ncarried out helps in balancing the pressures on infrastructure. \n\nComparing  the  case  of  the  proposed  California  HSR  with  Japanese  Shinkansen, \nMurakami and Cervero (2010) examined the locational characteristics of job and labor \nmarkets  around  the  planned  HSR  stations.  They  applied  cluster  analysis  to  build  a \ntypology  of  26  proposed  stations  in  California  and  17  exiting  stations  in  Japan.  The \npurpose of categorization was to assess how different factors would influence the impact \nof HSR on urban development. On the basis of variables based on city characteristics, \nthe authors categorized 26 proposed stations in the following five categories: \n\n\u2022  Global and regional business centers,  \n\n\u2022  Edge cities, \n\n\u2022  Aerotropolis, \n\n\u2022  Leisure cities, and \n\n\u2022  Small intermediate cities. \n\nHall (2003) stresses that the edge city stations have a locational advantage of maximum \npotential for future development, especially when the HSR services directly connect to \nairports. Kasarda (2011) proposed the concept of aerotropolis, a city based on aviation-\nlinked  businesses  with  outlying  HSR  corridors  extending  across  the  clusters  of  these \nbusiness  and  associated  residential  developments  to  a  30\u201340 km  radius  from  an \ninternational airport. Empirical findings suggest that new HSR projects are more likely to \nlead to benefits in knowledge- and service-based industries along the corridor, but they \ntend  to  agglomerate  in  large,  globally  connected  cities  (Blanquart  and  Koning  2017; \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1040 \n \n\nBharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n\nChen  and  Hall  2012;  Chen,  Loukaitou-Sideris,  de  Ure\u00f1a,  and  Vickerman  2019;  Hall \n2014).  Growth  may  also  shift  from  small  intermediate  cities  to  edge  cities  because  of \nenhanced accessibility. \n\nLearning from cases in Spanish cities, Bellet (2009) finds that cities adopt inter-related \nstrategies on the advent of an HSR: \n\n\u2022  Strategy:  An  HSR  station  is  placed  in  the  city  periphery,  and  simultaneous \nremoval occurs of the conventional line tracks from the city center of Ciudad Real. \nThis  strategy  provided  the  city  with  an  opportunity  to  strengthen  the  core  by \nconsequently redeveloping the city center. The new HSR station at the periphery \nis an opportunity to create a secondary center in the city. \n\n\u2022  Strategy: Using land in a central location to build the HSR station, relocating the \nexisting railway activities in the periphery of Zaragoza city. There is relocation of \nrailway yards, freight facilities, and workshops. This provides a significant amount \nof land in the core city area, making it possible to be redeveloped for commercial \nestablishments. \n\n\u2022  Strategy:  Integrating  new  HSR  services  within  the  existing  conventional  rail \nstation  by  expanding  the  station  building  and  simultaneously  redeveloping  the \narea  around  the  station  in  Lleida.  The  city  was  able  to  accommodate  more \ncommercial activity in the vicinity of the station. \n\nLoukaitou-Sideris et al. (2011) discuss six variables that intervene and influence the type \nof urban design strategy and station area development: \n\n\u2022  Geographic  context:  Large  metro  center,  small  metro  center,  suburban \nemployment center, suburban dormitory and outer-urban dormitory, rural, airport-\nrelated \n\n\u2022  Ridership: Origin, destination \n\n\u2022  Station location: Central or peripheral \n\n\u2022  Network type: Shared with a conventional line or dedicated tracks \n\n\u2022  Guideway track: Elevated, surface tunnel, type of parking \n\n\u2022  Type of parking: Structure or surface; concentrated or distributed \n\nLoukaitou-Sideris and Colton (2017) argue that the geographic context, ridership count, \nand station location directly influence the mix of land use as well as the type and scale \nof  development  in  the  station  area.  The  type  of  rail  network  will  drive  the  type  of \ndevelopment  on  the  adjacent  land,  whether  it  is  shared  with  the  conventional  rail  or \ndedicated tracks. The arrangement of the guideway tracks also defines the morphology \nof  the  surroundings:  For  instance,  stations  located  underground  or  elevated  stations \nprovide  more  land  for  development  adjacent  to  the  station  in  comparison  to  stations \nlocated on the surface. This aspect, along with the type of parking, would together define \nthe level of integration of the station into its surroundings. \n\n5.2  Factors That Trigger Station Area Development \n\nEurope in the past two decades had observed intensification of station area development \nand redevelopment projects. Bertolini and Spit (1998) identify several innovations and \nchanges \nnear  \nHSR railway stations across Europe. Changes such as technological innovations, new \n\nredevelopment \n\nresponsible \n\nprojects \n\nwere \n\nthat \n\nfor \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1040 \n \n\nBharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n\ninstitutional frameworks, and transformation in the spatial dynamics of the region have \nbeen driving innovative public policies, adding to the quality of life. \n\nCutting-edge engineering and technological innovations, particularly the development of \nHSR, helped in minimizing the distances and improving accessibility of the cities served \nby HSR. This enhanced accessibility worked as a boon for many multi-branch firms. This \ndemand  generated  by  the  relocation  of  firms  triggered  new  developments  around \nstations. One of the most reviewed case studies is that of Lille, a critical junction between \nLondon, Paris, and Brussels on the Channel-Tunnel link. The proposal of a station at this \njunction  triggered  significant  development  in  the  station  surroundings,  known  as \n\u2018Euralille.\u2019 \n\nPrivatization of railway operating companies is one of the common institutional changes \nfound  across  rail  operators  in  Europe.  Privatization  helps  companies  capture  the \nlocational advantage of a railway station to its maximum potential, attracting investments \nto develop land above and around the station. Not only the railway operators, but also \nthe city municipal corporations, were seen updating their policies in order to improve the \ncity\u2019s competitive image, taking advantage of the HSR investment. This resulted in some \nlarge-scale  station-city  redevelopment  plans.  In  the  case  of  the  Netherlands,  such \nredevelopment plans are part of national policies: The country\u2019s HSR stations are part of \nsizeable nation-wide, government-funded urban development projects, referred to as the \n\u2018New Key Projects\u2019 (Bruinsma et al. 2008). \n\nIn addition to the aim to gain economic advantages, policies for urban development are \noften provoked by a desire for sustainable, inclusive, and compact urban forms. These \nare  desirable  since  they  can  easily  be  served  by  city-level  transportation,  promote \nwalkability, reduce environmental impacts, and enhance quality of life. Development of \ndense urban nodes around the HSR stations has been promoted to achieve a certain \ndesired urban form, as some of the central European cities are currently shrinking. These \ndevelopments are enabled by the public, as well as private, sectors who are willing to \ninvest, as well as the availability of large parcels of developable land near many station \nareas.  However,  a  significant  driver  has  been  the  brownfield  sites  \u2013  left  empty  in  the \nwake of de-industrialization and the shift to a service economy \u2013 resulting in the structural \ntransformation of the whole region. \n\nSeeking to understand and measure the forces behind the intensification of station area \ndevelopment in the Netherlands, Bertolini (1998) elucidates the node-place dynamics of \nthe  station  area.  He  uses  examples  of  different  station  areas  around  Dutch  railway \nstations to form a model in which different station areas vary in their value as nodes and \nas places. In the Node-Place model (shown in Figure 4), the value of a station as a node \nis  a  function  of  the  accessibility  of  the  HSR  station.  However,  value  as  a  place  is  a \nfunction of the intensity and diversity of activities in the station area. \n\nNevertheless, the model clarifies the tremendous need for urban design considerations \nto be given to each station type \u2013 node or place, or both. The binary nature of station \nareas having to become nodes, catering to both transport and non-transport networks, \nand as places hosting diverse uses, generates a series of challenges. Bertolini and Spit \n(1998) identified five challenges: \n\n\u2022  Spatial challenges arise because of the compressed nature of most of the station \nsites.  These  challenges  may  paralyze  the  fluidity  required  for  passengers\u2019 \nintermodal  transfers,  as  well  as  other  users,  including  railway  staff.  The \ncumbersome  nature  of  railway  infrastructure  often  creates  a  barrier  effect \ndissecting the station from the area around it. However, unlike airports, railway \nstations may be integrated into dense urban contexts, forming nodes. \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1040 \n \n\nBharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n\n\u2022  Temporal  challenges  arise  as  urban  redevelopment  plans  and  investments  in \ntransport  infrastructure  do  not  align  on  time  horizons.  Moreover,  with  the \ngenerally  decade-long  time  frame  of  station  area  development,  the  projects \ngenerate  uncertainty.  Such  uncertainty  is  exceptionally  puzzling  for  public \nauthorities as well as private developers, delaying subsequent investments in the \nsurroundings. Unexpected fluctuations in the real estate markets can indirectly \naffect planning. \n\n\u2022  Functional challenges arise in setting up multifunctional environs, as HSR railway \nstations  act  as  both \nfor  passengers  and  \ntransit  nodes  and  places \nnon-travelers  to  move  and  or  assemble.  The  complexity  thus  created  by  the \nm\u00e9lange of activities within a relatively tight area is challenging to address. \n\n\u2022  Financial  challenges  become  a  burden  in  the  case  of  addressing  technical \ndifficulties  and  including  incompatible  design  requirements.  Hence,  the  public \nsector often relies on private sector instruments, like the use of higher floor-area \nratios (FARs) or floor-space index (FSI) and the transfer of development rights \n(TDR) for intensifying the land use. Revenue from the tax is essential; this creates \nmore demand for commercial land use than other land-uses in the proximity of \nthe station. \n\n\u2022  Management challenges give rise to \u2018not in my backyard\u2019 issues and arguments. \nDue  to  the  presence  of  public,  private,  and  public\u2013private  investments  and \nproperties \nstakeholders  \nthe \nare  involved  in  and  are  responsible  for  maintenance.  Hence,  the  need  for \nstakeholder  coordination  is  of  paramount  importance  for  operation  and  future \nplanning of the station, as well as the station area. \n\nstation,  many \n\naround \n\nand \n\nin \n\nFigure 4: Node-Place Model by Luca Bertolini (1998) \n\n5.3  The Good Station Area Plan \n\nThe earlier section elaborated on the fact that development within an HSR station and \nsurrounding  areas  is  crucial  and  challenging  in  inter-disciplinary  ways,  too.  What \ncontributes to proper HSR station area planning? \n\n \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1040 \n \n\nBharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n\nAs  the  previous  sections  have  highlighted,  HSR  station  areas  should  be  both \ntransportation  nodes  and  connector  places.  A \nthe \nsophisticated  setting  of  a  good  station  area  consists  of  planning  and  policy  factors. \nPlanning  and  policy  factors  result  in  an  envisioned  blend  of  facilities  around  the  \nstation.  Compatible  planning  and  urban  development  policies  can  achieve  good \nintermodal connections, better door-to-door services, and compact urban forms, by the \nconcentration of business, cultural, and entertainment activities.  \n\nthird  dimension  regarding \n\nJapan,  after  the  introduction  of  the  first  HSR,  has  had  the  most  extensive  history  of \nstation-adjacent developments (\u99c5\u524d\u958b\u767a). Learning from the station area development \ncases  in  Japan,  Morichi  (2013)  suggests  a  decision-making  process  for  station  area \ndevelopment.  He  suggests  a  four-step  guideline  for  achieving  positive  impacts  of  \nhigh-speed rail on urban development in the form of station area development projects: \n\n\u2022  Developing a strategy for future urban structures based on the potential of the \n\nimpact on the region and formulating a master plan of the station area; \n\n\u2022  Select the target zone to be developed and decide on the types of incentives and \n\navailable or required regulation mechanisms; \n\n\u2022  Establish an institution for the development to be responsible for implementing \nthe zoning and land-use changes as per the target zone requirements; and \n\n\u2022 \n\nImplement the project as per by the master plan. \n\nThe  above  points  demand  an  uncluttered  understanding  amongst  the  stakeholders. \nMoreover,  the  timing  of  the  land  development  around  the  station  overrides  all  other \ndecisions made during the project. Timing is critical for driving the relationship between \nthe demand for land and its price as soon as an HSR project is announced. Land prices \nare expected to be lower soon after the completion of the HSR project, even though they \nmight  be  higher  without \nthe  cost  of  \nland  development  can  be  less  expensive  compared  to  delayed  development  in  the \nstation area. \n\nthe  HSR  project.  This  means \n\nthat \n\nSchutz (1998) (quoted and translated in Pol 2003) describes the development areas that \nmight  benefit  from  the  advent  of  an  HSR.  He  distinguished  the  areas  around  \nan  HSR  station  into  three  development  zones:  primary,  secondary,  and  tertiary \ndevelopment zones (see Table 1).  \n\nTable 1: Development Zones around an HSR Station \n\n \n\nAccessibility to and \nfrom the HSR station \n\nLocation potential \n\nPrimary \nDevelopment Zone \nDirect 5\u201310 min on \nfoot or by seamless \ntransport \n\nLocation for high-\ngrade (inter)national \nfunctions \n\nBuilding density \n\nVery high \n\nDevelopment dynamic  Very high \n\nHigh \n\nSource: Schutz (1998). \n\nSecondary  \nDevelopment Zone \n\nTertiary  \nDevelopment Zone \n\nIndirect <15 min, by \ncomplementary transport \nmodes (including travel \nand transfer time) \n\nSecondary location for \nhigh-grade functions. \nSpecialized functions \nrelated to specific location \n(cluster) \nHigh \n\nIndirect >15 min, by \ncomplementary \ntransport modes \n(including travel and \ntransfer time) \nVariety of functions \ndepending on specific \nlocation factors \n\nDepends on specific \nsituation \nModest \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1040 \n \n\nBharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n\nSchutz affirms that the primary development zone, among all other zones, would receive \nand reflect the greatest effects of the advent of an HSR station. Because of the proximity \nto the HSR, the area profits directly from its improved status as a location. Therefore, in \nthe  primary  development  zone,  high-grade  office  and  residential  functions  can  be \nestablished,  and  within  the  same  zone,  land  and  real  estate  prices  are  expected  to \nchange the most. As a result, to reap maximum benefits, high building density becomes \nan important aspect in the development of this area. Secondary development zones may \nalso  establish  high-grade  functions,  although  the  benefits  in  real  estate  will  be  less \ncompared to those of the primary development zone. The tertiary development zones \nmay  add  to  the  benefits  of  the  primary  development  zone  by  the  introduction  of \ncomplementary transport modes that would serve other areas in the urban region. The \ntertiary zone, however, is not likely to show any direct development effects that can be \nassociated with the arrival of HSR services. \n\nFigure 5: Three Development Zones around an HSR Station  \n\nSource: Schutz (1998), adapted from Pol (2002). \n\nFigure 6: Hub and Spoke Model of Station Area Development  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Oh (2013). \n\n \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1040 \n \n\nBharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n\nAccording  to  Oh  (2013),  the  KTX  stations  are  emerging  as  the  core  of  the  regional \ndevelopment in the Republic of Korea. Station area development plans were prepared \nfor KTX stations. A hub-spoke model was adopted to increase station accessibility from \nthe  surrounding  areas  (refer  to  Figures  5  and  6).  The  plans  embedded  intermodal \ntransport  center  complexes  (ITCCs),  which  both  combine  intermodal  transfer  and \nintegrate business and commercial activities within the station area, although, the station \ndevelopment projects have had some difficulties that resulted in inadequate returns from \ninvestment. First, there was a delay in the construction of the feeder transport system. \nSecond, \nlack  of  capability  \nof the project-executing agencies. Third, there were no rules or guidelines for the station \narea  development  (Sunduck  et  al.  2005).  The  integrated  coordination  of  all  the \nstakeholders is overly complicated and is very difficult to be adjusted, if not established \nbeforehand. \n\nin  development  due \n\nthere  was  a  delay \n\nto \n\nIn  a  survey  of  HSR  experts,  Loukaitou-Sideris  and  colleagues  (2011)  summarize  the \nessential  preconditions  found  for  station  area  development.  The  experts  highlighted \nsome critical pre-conditions for the policymakers and other stakeholders to develop the \nHSR station areas. These include central station location, integration of the station with \nits surroundings, connectivity to the station, level of service, and strong political will and \nvision of the stakeholders. \n\n6.  SUMMARY \n\ntwo  decades  several  corridors  have  been  developed \n\nHSR has been in operation for over 50 years in many countries. Within Asia itself, during \nthe  past \nthe  PRC  \nand  countries  like  India,  Viet  Nam,  and  Thailand,  and  others  are  also  planning  and \nconstructing  HSRs.  The  studies  reviewed  in  the  paper  have  argued  that  the  effects  \nof transport infrastructure investments on the location are subject to externalities. In spite \nof  such  growth  in  the  HSR  networks,  the  doubts  of  the  potentials  of  the  HSR \ninfrastructure have not been fully dispelled. While the potential effects of HSR can be \nlong-ranging and multitudinous. Such challenges include building alternative resources \nthat are required to elicit benefits from the spillovers of mega-infrastructure projects. \n\nin \n\nThis  paper  outlines  the  global  experience  of  HSR  and  concludes  that  HSR  brings  in \nconsiderable  socio-economic  benefits  that  cannot  be  captured  through  econometric \nmodelling alone. Capturing the impacts of HSR infrastructure requires analysis involving \na  scaler  as  well  as  a  temporal  lens.  Impacts  of  infrastructure  on  quality  of  \nlife  vary  with  the  scale  of  development  and  time  required  to  achieve  the  expected \nimpacts. This paper shows that HSR may become a core infrastructure for desired urban \ndevelopments and \u2013 at the same time \u2013 may also lead to undesirable outcomes. \n\nlocality.  Better  accessibility  will  change \n\nIn terms of scale, first \u2013 at the regional level \u2013 the HSR network changes the accessibility \nof  a \nthe  mobility  patterns  and  \nwill  eventually  affect  the  development  in  the  impact  region,  reshaping  the  entire  \nurban-regional system. Countries developing an HSR network need to rigorously plan \nthe  path  to  elicit  maximum  benefits  while  investing  in  HSR  infrastructure.  This  is \nparticularly important in the case of countries with an elaborate city system. Countries \nlike  India,  Thailand,  and  Indonesia  need  to  understand  their  metropolis  formation \nprocesses. Understanding the current system of cities may aid in planning HSR routes \nto  redistribute  the  urban  functions  from  one  region  to  another,  in  order  to  attain  a \nbalanced regional development. \n\n \n\n \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1040 \n \n\nBharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n\nSecond, at the urban scale, the HSR is expected to play a catalyzing role to drive the \nspatial and urban transformation processes. The paper emphasizes the importance of \nestablishing a cooperation between HSR and urban and local development. A synergy \nbetween  HSR  and  other  elements,  like  urban  transit-paratransit  facilities,  station  area \ndevelopment, and sub-center development, would radically increase the spillover effects \n(Bharule 2019a). Increased accessibility to services and the convenience of travelling \nthereby enhance the overall quality of life in the city. This has been a common experience \namong all HSR-operating countries. Achieving such cooperation demands innovation in \ninstitutional arrangements across all the relevant elements to deliver enhanced livability \nin an urban space. \n\nThird,  this  paper  also  draws  attention  to  the  importance  of  station  area  development \nplanning and its relationship with HSR stations. The discussion elucidates the multiple \ncharacteristics and overlapping factors associated with station area development, while \nnoting  that  these  complexities  collectively  lead  to  the  formation  of  a  station  area. \nDevelopment in the station surroundings usually takes more than a decade, and a robust \nstrategy  and  long-term  vision  are  therefore  necessary  from  the  outset  of  the  project \n(Seetharam and Bharule 2019). A vision for long-term integrated development demands \nfor a policy framework that gives equal importance to all the members, stakeholders, and \nactors.  However,  varying  governmental  setups  and  frameworks  of  infrastructure \nadoption  present  several  challenges  in  setting  up  an  egalitarian  policy  framework, \nespecially in emerging economies, where these policy challenges are sensitive to local \ncontext. \n\nLast, an HSR corridor is beneficial both to the cities and towns along the corridor and the \nrailway operator. To the cities and towns, HSR serves as a form of urban amenity that is \ncrucial to accelerating their economic growth and improving the quality of life. For the \nrailways, station areas provide an important opportunity to harness revenue through non-\nrailway businesses (Bharule 2019b). Realizing the full development effects of an HSR \nproject  may  take  decades.  Therefore,  careful  planning  and  coordination  among  the \nstakeholders  is  a  necessity  to  accomplish  a  set  of  phased  goals.  Although  evidence \nsuggests  that  the  introduction  of  HSR  services  is  largely  associated  with  the  service \nsector,  the  spillover  of  the  economic  activities  and  transport  infrastructure  generates \nimplications for local as well as regional spatial development strategies, enhancing the \nquality of life at all levels. \n\n \n\n \n\n19 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1040 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nBharule, Kidokoro, and Seta \n\nAmos, P., Bullock, D., and Sondhi, J.

HSR  can  simultaneously  become  a  core  component  on \ndesired urban developments, while also having undesirable outcomes. Positive impacts will \nbe  achieved  only  if interactions  with  other  factors  and  contexts  are  maintained.  This  paper \nstratifies and expands the understanding of the development effects of HSR at three levels  \n\u2013  regional,  urban,  and  station  area  \u2013  based  on  the  economic  and  temporal  nature  of  all \ninfrastructure projects. \n \nThere  is  ample  evidence  that  at  the  regional  level,  the  implementation  of  an  HSR  service \ndisrupts the existing network of cities along the proposed corridor. The HSR network changes \nthe  accessibility  of  a  locality.  Better  accessibility  will  change  the  mobility  patterns  and  will \neventually affect the development in the impacted region, reshaping the entire urban-regional \nsystem.  The  HSR  is  expected  to  play  a  catalyzing  role  in  driving  the  spatial  and  urban \ntransformation  process.  This  paper  emphasizes  the  importance  of  establishing  a  synergy \nbetween  HSR  and  urban  development.  A  synergy  between  HSR  and  other  elements,  like \nurban  transit  facilities,  paratransit,  station  area  development,  node,  and  sub-center \ndevelopment,  can  usher  in  spatial  and  economic  development,  but  an  institutional \narrangement  across  all  the  elements  is  of  paramount  importance.  Such  a  synergy  would \nenhance livability and provide improved quality of life opportunities in cities and regions served \nby HSR. \n \nLast, an HSR corridor is beneficial both to the settlements along the corridor and to the railway \noperator. An HSR corridor is also beneficial to the cities along the railways, and the station \nareas provide an important opportunity to harness revenue through non-railway businesses. \nHowever, achieving the full development effects of an HSR project may take decades. Careful \npre-planning  of  the  project  and  coordination  amongst  the  stakeholders  are  necessary  to \naccomplish a set of phased goals to realize the envisioned development of an HSR corridor. \n \nKeywords: high-speed rail, regional development, urban development, station area \ndevelopment \n \nJEL Classification: O18, R11, R12, R52, R58 \n \n", " \n"]}
