Data used in the paper are mainly taken\nfrom two national surveys: Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES)\nand Poverty Monitoring Survey (PMS) conducted by Bangladesh Bureau of\nStatistics (BBS). Poverty in Bangladesh was earlier measured by direct calorie\nintake (DCI) method. The food energy intake (FEI) method was first used in the\nPoverty Monitoring Survey 1995. The cost of basic need (CBN) method was first\nused in HIES 1995-1996 and then in HIES-2000.\nFindings from the surveys indicate that the incidence of poverty has declined\nover the years. The Foster-Greer-Thorbecke class of poverty estimates also indicate\nreduction of the poverty head count ratio, poverty gap, and squared poverty\ngap in the recent past. The distribution of income and expenditure shows that\nthough nominal income has increased, income distribution has become skewed\nwith high concentration of income in the highest decile and comparatively lower\nincome share in the lowest decile. The quintile distribution of income also shows\nsimilar evidence. With respect to nonincome indicators, infant mortality rate has\ndeclined, life expectancy has increased, and enrollment in primary and secondary\nlevels has increased.", "I. INTRODUCTION\nPoverty refers to forms of economic, social, and psychological deprivation among people arising\nfrom a lack of ownership and control of or access to resources for the attainment of a required minimum\nlevel of living. It is a multidimensional problem involving a deficiency of income, consumption, nutrition,\nhealth, education, housing, etc.\nThe purpose of this paper is to describe and analyze data pertaining to poverty in Bangladesh\u2014\nhow it is collected, how poverty is measured\u2014in order to facilitate the work of researchers, planners,\nadministrators, policymakers, and donors in finding appropriate measures for poverty alleviation\nin Bangladesh.\nThere are several measures of poverty, all of them belonging to the so-called Foster-Greer-\nThorbecke (FGT) poverty indices (Foster et al. 1984). One of them is the simple and popular index\nwidely known as the head count index. Others are the poverty gap and squared poverty gap measures.\nAll these measures need a poverty line for their computation. Three methods are used in Bangladesh\nfor poverty line estimation. These are the direct calorie intake method (DCI), the food energy intake\nmethod (FEI), and the cost of basic needs method (CBN).\nThe Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) of the Planning Division under the Ministry of Planning\nis the organization mandated by law to collect, compile, and disseminate statistics of importance.\nThe BBS has conducted Household Expenditure Surveys (HES) since 1963-1964. After modifying\nthe HES by adding more questions on income, the survey was renamed Household Income and\nExpenditure Survey (HIES) in 2000.1 So far, BBS has conducted 13 rounds of the HIES. In the\nmid-1990s BBS started another survey, this time focusing on poverty. The survey was called Poverty\nMonitoring Survey (PMS).  By 1999, seven rounds of the PMS survey had been completed.\nThe latest HIES, conducted during February 2000 through January 2001, indicates that rural\npoverty in Bangladesh has declined since the HES survey of 1995-1996. However, urban poverty has\nincreased in the same period.\nThe paper samples data from three surveys: HES 1985-1996, PMS 1999, and HIES 2000. The\nnext section of the paper discusses data sources. Section III discusses income and expenditure\ndistribution, Section IV discusses the poverty line, and Section V discusses poverty estimates at\nnational and subnational levels. Section VI discusses nonincome indicators of poverty and Section\nVII discusses the quality of survey data. The last section summarizes the findings of the study.\n1 Although HES also had an income module, more emphasis on income is given in the HIES.", "PRACTICES OF POVERTY MEASUREMENT AND POVERTY PROFILE OF BANGLADESH\nFAIZUDDIN AHMED\nII. DATA SOURCES\nThe main source of poverty-related data in Bangladesh is the HIES, earlier known as HES.\nThe latest HIES was conducted in 2000.2 Another source is the PMS, which focuses exclusively\non poverty. The PMS was conducted separately for urban and rural areas from 1995 to 1999. The\nsample designs of HES, HIES, and PMS are described below.\nA. Household Expenditure Survey 1995-1996\nA two-stage stratified random sampling technique was followed in drawing the sample of HES\n1995-1996 under the framework of the Integrated Multipurpose Sample design developed on the basis\nof the Population and Housing Census 1991. The sample consists of 372 primary sampling units (PSUs)\nthroughout the country, broken down into 252 rural and 120 urban PSUs. The PSU is defined as\ncontiguous two or more enumeration areas in the Population and Housing Census 1991. Each PSU\ncomprises around 250 households.\nIn the first stage, a total of 372 PSUs was drawn from the sample frame with probability\nproportional to size. These PSUs were selected from 14 different strata, of which five were rural and\nnine urban (including four statistical metropolitan areas and five municipal areas). In the second\nstage, 20 households were selected from each PSU by systematic random sampling method.\nAmong the 372 PSUs, one in the Dhaka statistical metropolitan area  could not be visited by\nfield teams. As a result, a total of 371 PSUs were covered, 119 in urban and 252 in rural areas. A\ntotal of 7,420 households were interviewed.\nB. Household Income & Expenditure Survey 2000\nThe sample design adopted for HIES 2000 was the same as that of HES 1995-1996, except only\nfor the addition of questions on income. However the number of PSUs in the statistical metropolitan\nareas  was doubled to 140 instead of 70 as in HES 1995-1996. At the same time the number of\nhouseholds in each of these PSUs was reduced to one half of the number in the HES, i.e., only 10\nhouseholds instead of 20.  Thus the number of sample households remained the same for both the\nsurveys but the number of PSUs increased from 372 to 442. Table 1 presents the distribution of\nsample PSUs and sample households by division and residence.\n2 For the 1990s, there were two HES: 1991-1992 and 1995-1996. The results of the 1991-1992 and 1995-1996 surveys\nhave all been published.\n2 AUGUST 2004", "SECTION III\nINCOME AND EXPENDITURE DISTRIBUTION\nTABLE 1\nNUMBER OF SAMPLE PSUS AND HOUSEHOLDS\nHES 1995-1996 HIES 2000\nDIVISION NATIONAL RURAL URBAN NATIONAL RURAL URBAN\nSample PSUs\nBarisal 36 26 10 36 26 10\nChittagong 86 60 26 102 60 42\nDhaka 113 69 44 149 69 80\nKhulna 48 29 19 59 29 30\nRajshahi 88 68 20 96 68 28\nTotal 371 252 119 442 252 190\nSample Households\nBarisal 720 520 200 720 520 200\nChittagong 1720 1200 520 1720 1200 520\nDhaka 2260 1380 880 2280 1380 900\nKhulna 960 580 380 960 580 380\nRajshahi 1760 1360 400 1760 1360 400\nTotal 7420 5040 2380 7440 5040 2400\nC. Poverty Monitoring Survey 1999\nA two-stage stratified sampling design was followed in drawing the sample for PMS 1999. The\nlist of the enumeration areas of the 1991 Population Census was used as the sample frame. These\nenumeration areas were treated as primary sampling units. Each PSU was a cluster of around 100\nhouseholds.  The universe, i.e., the whole country, was divided into two strata: urban and rural. Each\nof the two strata was further subdivided into 23 substrata, i.e., each of the country\u2019s 23 regions\nformed a separate substratum. Using the 1991 population census frame, a sample of 300 PSUs was\nallocated to the 23 urban substrata at the first stage. Proportional allocation was made in allocating\nthe PSUs to the 23 regions.\nThe required number of PSUs was drawn systematically using a random start. All the households\nin the selected PSUs were listed completely in a listing form. Then a subsample of 20 households\nwas drawn randomly from each selected PSU using a table of random numbers. Thus in the urban\nuniverse, there were 300*20, i.e., 6,000 households in the sample. A similar procedure was adopted\nin drawing the sample from the rural universe except that the number of PSUs selected for the rural\nuniverse was 500 and the ultimate sample households 500*20, i.e., 10,000.\nIII. INCOME AND EXPENDITURE DISTRIBUTION\nUsing data collected from various rounds of the HES/HIES, this section deals with average\nhousehold income, expenditure, and household consumption expenditure by major items of expenditure,\nand the distribution of income and expenditure to each decile of the households, and related\nconsiderations.\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 54 3", "PRACTICES OF POVERTY MEASUREMENT AND POVERTY PROFILE OF BANGLADESH\nFAIZUDDIN AHMED\nA. Household Income, Expenditure, and Consumption Expenditure\nHousehold income, expenditure, and consumption expenditure from 1985-1986 to 2000 are\npresented in Table 2. Expenditure refers to total expenditure, including nonrecurring expenditure.\nOn the other hand, consumption expenditure excludes nonrecurring expenses.3 The table shows that\nhousehold income and consumption increased gradually over the years. Income increased between\n1985-1986 and 1988-1989 by 11.1 percent, between 1988-1989 and 1991-1992 by 16 percent, between\n1991-1992 and 1995-1996 by 30.7 percent, and between 1995-1996 and 2000 by 33.8 percent. The\ncorresponding annual rates of increase were 3.7, 5.3 , 7.7, and 7.5 percent.\nTABLE 2\nMONTHLY HOUSEHOLD NOMINAL INCOME EXPENDITURE AND CONSUMPTION\nAVERAGE MONTHLY (TAKA)\nSURVEY YEAR RESIDENCE HOUSEHOLD INCOME EXPENDITURE CONSUMPTION\nSIZE EXPENDITURE\n2000 National 5.2 5842 4881 4537\nRural 5.2 4816 4257 3879\nUrban 5.1 9878 7337 7125\n1995-96 National 5.3 4366 4096 4026\nRural 5.3 3658 3473 3426\nUrban 5.3 7973 7274 7084\n1991-92 National 5.3 3341 2944 2904\nRural 5.3 3109 2721 2690\nUrban 5.3 4832 4377 4280\n1988-89 National 5.5 2865 2592 2554\nRural 5.5 2670 2405 2374\nUrban 5.6 4223 3900 3816\n1985-86 National 5.9 2578 2345 2316\nRural 5.8 2413 2179 2157\nUrban 6.1 3766 3540 3459\nOn the other hand expenditure increased between 1985-1986 and 1988-1989 by 10.5 percent,\nbetween 1988-1989 and 1991-1992 by 13.6 percent, between 1991-1992 and 1995-1996 by 39.1\npercent, and between 1995-1996 and 2000 by 19.2 percent. Consumption expenditure increased in\nthese years also, between 1985-1986 and 1988-1989 by 13.3 percent, between 1988-1989 and 1991-\n1992 by 13.7 percent, between 1991-1992 and 1995-1996 by 38.6 percent, and between 1995-1996\nand 2000 by 12.7 percent. The annual increases for the corresponding years for consumption expenditure\nwere 4.3, 4.6, 9.7, and 3.2 percent.\n3 Nonrecurring expenditure such as ceremonial expenditure, taxes, and major repairs is excluded from the expenditure to\nderive consumption expenditures and for this reason consumption expenditure is always less than expenditure.\n4 AUGUST 2004", "SECTION III\nINCOME AND EXPENDITURE DISTRIBUTION\nIt can be noticed that the rate of increase in income was higher than the rate of increase\nin expenditure except for the years 1991-1992 to 1995-1996 when income increased by 30.7 percent\nwhereas expenditure increased by 39.1 percent. Between 1995-1996 and 2000 the excess of the rate\nof increase of income over the rate of increase of consumption expenditure was substantial\u201433.8\npercent as against only 19.2 percent.\nB.    Food and Nonfood Expenditure\nThe proportion of food and nonfood expenditure changed gradually over the years, as shown\nin Table 3. Between 1985-1986 and 2000, at the national level the proportion of food declined\nfrom 63.3 to 54.6 percent, a fall of 8.7 percentage points. The same trend is evident in both rural\nand urban areas except that in the rural areas the decline was only 5.8 percentage points. In the\nurban areas the decline was greater, 10.5 percentage points.  These changes suggest that households\nare increasingly allocating their consumption expenditure to nonfood items.\nTABLE 3\nFOOD AND NONFOOD EXPENDITURE AS PERCENTAGE OF HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES\nNATIONAL RURAL URBAN\nSURVEY YEAR FOOD NONFOOD FOOD NONFOOD FOOD NON-FOOD\n2000 54.6 45.4 59.3 40.7 44.6 55.4\n1995-1996 57.7 42.3 62.4 37.6 46.3 53.7\n1991-1992 66.6 33.4 69.2 30.8 56.1 43.9\n1988-1989 65.5 34.2 67.6 32.4 56.1 43.9\n1985-1986 63.3 36.7 65.1 34.9 55.1 45.0\nC.

In 1988-1989,\nthe lowest 30 percent of households received incomes equal to 37 percent of the income of the\ntop 10 percent of households. This was down to 28 percent in 2000.\nThe Gini coefficient tells the same story.  This was 0.379 in 1988-1989 and 0.417 in 2000.\nMuch the same trend can be seen in the rural and urban areas, although the decline was less\nsharp in the rural areas. In the rural areas, the lowest 5 percent of households received 1.1 percent\nof total income in 1988-1989 and only 1.1 percent in 2000.  The opposite is true for the top 5 percent\nof households, which received 19.8 percent of income in 1988-1989 and 24.1 percent in 2000.\nThe Gini coefficient fell slightly, from 0.368 in 1988-1989 to 0.366 in 2000.  If the deterioration\nwas only slight in the rural areas, it was glaring in the urban areas. Here, the lowest 5 percent\nof the households received an income of 1.1 percent of total in 1988-1989 but only 0.8 percent\nin 2000. On the other hand, the top 5 percent of households increased their share of 20.0 percent\nin 1988-1989 to 32.4 percent in 2000. The Gini coefficient rose from 0.381 in 1988-1989 to 0.452\nin 2000.\n Altogether, the data indicate that the inequality of income distribution widened in the country,\nparticularly in the urban areas. The high incidence of poverty in the urban areas supports this fact.\nE. Distribution of Expenditure\nThe distribution of household expenditure by decile in 2000 is presented in Table 6. The\ntable shows that the expenditure accruing to the lowest decile was 3.6 percent while for the top\ndecile the expenditure was 28.2 percent. In other words, the expenditure of the lowest decile was\nonly 13 percent of the top decile\u2019s. Even if the lowest three deciles are counted, their expenditure\nof 13.9 percent of total expenditure constitutes only 49 percent of the expenditure of the top\ndecile. In the rural areas, the picture is less lopsided. Here the lowest decile expended 4.0 percent\nof total expenditure as against 24.9 percent by the top decile. The expenditure of the three lowest\ndeciles amounting to 15.3 percent of total represents 61 percent of the expenditure of the top\ndecile. The situation is much less rosy in the urban areas where the expenditure of 2.9 percent\nof the lowest decile compares with the 30.3 percent of the highest decile. In fact, the expenditure\nof the lowest three deciles amounting to 11.9 percent of total constitutes only 39 percent of the\nexpenditure of the top decile.\nThe Gini coefficient for 2000 was 0.32 for the nation as a whole, and the weighted average\nwas 0.28 for the rural areas and 0.34 for the urban areas.\n8 AUGUST 2004", "SECTION III\nINCOME AND EXPENDITURE DISTRIBUTION\nTABLE 6\nDISTRIBUTION OF HOUSEHOLD EXPENDITURE, 2000\nDECILES NATIONAL RURAL URBAN\nDecile-1 3.58 3.99 2.94\nDecile-2 4.75 5.26 4.01\nDecile-3 5.54 6.07 4.92\nDecile-4 6.37 6.90 5.79\nDecile-4 7.25 7.81 6.82\nDecile-6 8.24 8.77 8.21\nDecile-7 9.61 9.99 9.89\nDecile-8 11.52 11.79 11.84\nDecile-9 14.89 14.46 15.24\nDecile-10 28.22 24.91 30.31\nGini Coefficient 0.32 0.28 0.34\nF.

POVERTY LINES\nBangladesh has used all commonly known approaches to the setting of poverty lines, i.e., direct\ncalorie intake, food energy intake, and cost-of-basic needs methods. Since the mid-1990s the government\nhas used the CBN method.4 Independent researchers favor the CBN method.\nA. The DCI Method and the FEI Method\n The earliest official poverty estimates in Bangladesh were made through the use of the DCI\nmethod. Using this method, poor households were defined as those with per capita energy intake\nless than the standard per capita requirement of energy. Reviews made of the DCI method conclude\nthat it results in a consistent poverty line in terms of reflecting the same nutrient intake. The number\nand percentage of poor are also easy to understand because of the simplicity and transparency of\nthe standard used. However, it is said that the DCI measures \u201cundernourishment\u201d and not poverty.\nThe latter entails deprivation in all aspects of welfare and not just in calorie intake.\nMore recently, the FEI method has been used officially along with the DCI method. The FEI\nmethod sets the poverty line as the income or consumption level at which \u201cbasic needs\u201d are met.\nIt estimates the poverty line on the basis of the empirical relationship between food energy intakes\nand consumption expenditure. This method, like the DCI method, is consistent in terms of calorie\nintake, since individuals at the poverty line, on average, have the same food energy intake. But this\npoverty line, when converted into expenditure levels, has a consistency problem. Instead of representing\na consistent cut-off that should differ only with the cost of a fixed basic needs bundle, the expenditure\nlevel is in fact a revealed preference based on different market conditions where individuals operate.\nFor instance, it is possible that because per capita expenditure in richer areas tends to be higher\nthan in the poorer areas, the resulting poverty lines, even when using the same benchmark calorie\nrequirement, will tend to be higher in the former. While the difference may be due to the fact that\nprices are generally higher in more progressive areas, preference for superior or more expensive sources\nof calories and other items of expenditure also pulls the poverty line upward (Ravallion and Sen\n1994).\nIt is worth mentioning that there exists a distinct difference between the DCI method and FEI\nmethod. Under the DCI method data collected from the households on food consumption (quantities)\nare converted to calorie by multiplying each food item consumed by that household by its corresponding\ncalorie content. The conversion factor derived by the Institute of Nutrition and Food Science, Dhaka\nUniversity, is used. The population/households consuming less than 2122 kilocalories (kcal) are defined\nas poor. On the other hand under the FEI method a poverty line expenditure is determined on the\nbasis of the threshold calorie intake of 2122 kcal from the food and nonfood expenditure using the\nsemi-log model: ln(y) = a + b*x where y is the per capita expenditure per month (food + nonfood)\nand  x  is the per capita calorie intake per day.\n4  The poverty estimates from the PMS have been based on the FEI method, however. Therefore, poverty estimates from\nthis survey are not comparable with those derived from the HES/HIES, which have been based on the CBN method.\n10 AUGUST 2004", "SECTION IV\nPOVERTY LINES\nB. The CBN Method\nThe CBN method was introduced in the mid-1990s. This method sets the poverty line by computing\nthe cost of a food basket that enables a household to meet predetermined nutritional requirements,\nand adds to this an allowance for basic nonfood consumption. The CBN method yields a poverty line\nthat provides for nonfood needs and is consistent in terms of the assumed living standard.\nTable 8 shows the poverty lines calculated through the CBN method for the various geographical\nareas of the country, for the years 1991-1992, 1995-1996, and 2000. These are the poverty lines\ncurrently being used in Bangladesh.\nTABLE 8\nCBN POVERTY LINES (PER CAPITA, PER MONTH)\n1991-92 1995-96 2000\nGEOGRAPHIC AREA ZL ZU ZL ZU ZL ZU\nSMA Dhaka 480 660 574 791 649 893\nOther Urban Dhaka 399 482 480 580 521 629\nRural Dhaka 425 512 492 593 548 659\nRural Faridpur Tangail Jamalpur 432 472 484 529 540 591\nSMA Chittagong 523 722 627 867 702 971\nOther urban Chittagong 517 609 619 730 694 818\nRural Sylhet Comilla 432 558 499 644 572 738\nRural Noakhali Chittagong 438 541 522 645 582 719\nUrban Khulna 482 635 552 727 609 803\nRural Barishal Pathuakali 413 467 494 558 546 616\nRural Khulna Jessore Kushtia 420 497 499 592 527 624\nUrban Rajshahi 446 582 496 647 557 726\nRural Rajshahi Pabna 459 540 535 630 586 690\nRural Bogra Rangpur Dinajpur 426 487 468 535 510 582\nNote: SMA means statistical metropolitan area.\nNote that there are two poverty lines, the \u201clower\u201d and the \u201cupper\u201d poverty lines. Both consist\nof the same amount of food items but differ in the amount allowed for nonfood items. The \u201cupper\u201d\nlines embrace a more generous allowance for nonfood items than the \u201clower\u201d lines. See Appendix\nA for technical details.\nThe government policy document entitled \u201cBangladesh: A National Strategy for Economic\nGrowth, Poverty Reduction and Social Development\u201d (EG-PRSD) used the above CBN poverty estimates\n(Bangladesh Economic Relations Division 2003).\nA World Bank poverty report in 1998 (World Bank 1998) uses the CBN method by valuing\na consumption bundle that meets a predetermined and fixed basic needs standard. Price differentials\nover time and across areas are taken into account by costing the food items in the fixed bundle\nusing area-specific prices prevailing each year. (See Tables of Appendix B for some of the price\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 54 11", "PRACTICES OF POVERTY MEASUREMENT AND POVERTY PROFILE OF BANGLADESH\nFAIZUDDIN AHMED\nindices and deflators used.) Nonfood allowances are also based on area-specific and actual nonfood\nexpenditures. The CBN method, however, poses more data requirements than the DCI and FEI methods.\nQuantities consumed and prices paid by the poor for the food items consumed have to be computed.\nFurther, the use of a fixed food bundle is contrary to the welfare-maximizing behavior of consumers.\nConsumers change their preferences when confronted by different sets of prices as they try to\noptimize utility and, therefore, maximize welfare (BBS 1998).\nFinally, the assumption of a fixed consumption bundle is not representative of the consumption\nbehavior of the poor. From actual findings of household surveys, the food consumption of the urban\nand rural poor differs substantially from the fixed food bundle. The FEI method, on the other hand,\nby using independent urban and rural samples, is able to take into account urban and rural variations\nin food consumption of households for the estimation of the poverty line (BBS 1998).\nV. POVERTY ESTIMATES: NATIONAL AND SUBNATIONAL LEVELS\nThe poverty lines reported here are the \u201cupper\u201d poverty lines, i.e., the poverty lines that give\na more generous allowance for nonfood items compared to the so-called \u201clower\u201d poverty lines\n(see Table 8).  Head count ratios are given for the nation as a whole and for specific geographical\nareas of the country.\nA. Head Count Ratio at the National Level\nApplying the poverty lines calculated through the CBN method as shown in Table 8, the number\nof households whose consumption expenditure falls below the cost of 2122 kcal of food per person\nper month and the cost of nonfood essentials can be ascertained.  This is called the head count\nratio, also called the poverty incidence.\nHead count ratios using the upper poverty lines are presented in Table 9. The figures are\ngiven for the country as a whole and for the country\u2019s five major divisions. The table shows that\nthe poverty head count ratio at the national level as well as in the rural areas decreased, whereas\nit increased in the urban areas from 1995-1996 to 2000. In the national level, the ratio was 51.0\npercent in 1995-1996 and 49.8 percent in 2000. In the rural areas, the reduction is more prominent\nwith the poverty head count ratio falling from 55.3 percent in 1995-1996 to 53.1 percent in 2000.\nOn the other hand, the poverty head count ratio in the urban areas increased from 29.5 percent\nin 1995-1996 to 36.6 percent in 2000.\nB. Head Count Ratio by Division\nLooking at the divisions, it can be seen that the head count ratio of the poor is highest in\nRajshahi (61.8 percent in 1995-1996 and 61.0 percent in 2000).  In contrast, the incidence of poverty\nis lowest in Barisal (49.9 percent in 1995-1996 and 39.8 percent in 2000) and Dhaka (40.2 percent\nin 1995-1996 and 44.8 percent in 2000).\n12 AUGUST 2004", "SECTION V\nPOVERTY ESTIMATES: NATIONAL AND SUBNATIONAL LEVELS\nTABLE 9\nHEAD COUNT RATIO BY DIVISION\n2000 1995-96\nDIVISION TOTAL URBAN RURAL TOTAL URBAN RURAL\nNational 49.8 36.6 53.1 51.0 29.5 55.3\nBarisal 39.8 37.9 40.0 49.9 44.4 50.2\nChittagong 47.7 44.0 48.4 52.4 40.8 54.0\nDhaka 44.8 28.2 52.9 40.2 18.4 48.5\nKhulna 51.4 47.1 52.2 55.0 48.7 56.0\nRajshahi 61.0 48.1 62.8 61.8 36.8 65.0\nBoth in 2000 and 1995-1996 the lowest incidences of poverty in urban areas were observed\nin Dhaka, where the head count indices were 28.2 and 18.4 percent, respectively.

Poverty Gap at the National Level\nPoverty gap is the shortfall in consumption expenditure necessary for a household to just\nexactly reach the poverty line. Poverty gaps at the national level and the country\u2019s five major\ngeographical divisions, broken down into rural and urban areas, are presented in Table 10. The\npoverty gap followed the same direction as the head count ratio\u2014a decrease in the nation as a\nwhole and particularly in the rural areas, but an increase in the urban areas.  At the national level\nit fell from 13.3 percent in 1995-1996 to 12.9 percent in 2000.  In the rural areas it fell from\n14.6 to 13.8 percent in the same period. On the other hand, it increased from 7.2 percent in 1995-\n1996 to 9.5 percent in 2000 in the urban areas.\nD. Poverty Gap by Division\nScanning now the divisions, the improvement in poverty reduction can be seen in all divisions\nexcept Dhaka. From 1995-1996 to 2000, the poverty gap fell in Barisal Division from 12.9 to 8.9\npercent; in Chittagong from 13.1 to 11.5 percent; in Khulna from 13.9 to 12.7 percent; and in Rajshahi\nfrom 17.8 to 17.7 percent. Only in Dhaka did it increase, from 10.1 to 11.5 percent.

NONINCOME INDICATORS OF POVERTY\nIn addition to income, there are nonincome indicators of poverty. Two of these are the infant\nmortality rate and the school enrolment ratio. The infant mortality rate reflects the state of the primary\nhealth care system of the country and the pace of its improvement over time while the school enrolment\nratio indicates the extent to which the country is able to deliver universal education to its people.\nThe infant mortality rate in Bangladesh is shown in Table 12.\nThe infant mortality rate, defined as the number of deaths per 1,000 live births, declined markedly\nover the decade. It was 94 in 1994 and down to 56 in 2001. The decline was true for each of the\nsexes. The rate was 98 down to 58 for boys, and 91 down to 55 for girls. This can be ascribed no\ndoubt to the improvement of the maternal health care system in the country in the last decade.\nTABLE 12\nINFANT MORTALITY RATE IN BANGLADESH\nYEAR BOTH SEXES MALE FEMALE\n1990 94 98 91\n1994 77 77 76\n1995 71 73 70\n1996 67 68 66\n1997 60 61 59\n1998 57 58 56\n1999 59 61 57\n2000 58 59 57\n2001 56 58 55\nThe net school enrolment ratio, defined as the number of children in school belonging to\nthe officially prescribed school age relative to the total number of children belonging to that\nprescribed age, is shown in Table 13.

Though improving, the ratio can be said to be on the low side, considering that,\nexcept in extraordinary cases, all children of school age should be in school.  In other words, the\nratio should in theory approach 100 percent.\nThe ratio for each of the sexes followed the same trend.

QUALITY OF DATA\nThe data on household consumption expenditure obtained from the HIES can be characterized\nas generally good and reliable. However, it differs from private consumption expenditure as generally\ncalculated in the System of National Accounts (SNA). Household consumption expenditure as estimated\nfrom different rounds of the HIES and private consumption expenditure in the NA are presented\nin Table 14.\nTABLE 14\nHOUSEHOLD AND PRIVATE CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURE\nYEAR HES SNA HES/HA\n(MILLION TAKA) (MILLION TAKA) (PERCENT)\n1991-92 662826 728632 91\n1995-96 1068870 1342157 79.6\n2000 1325557 1979929 66.9\n16 AUGUST 2004", "SECTION VIII\nCONCLUSION\nAs can be seen from the table, household consumption expenditure from HES was Tk 662,826\nmillion in 1991-1992 as against Tk 728,632 million of private consumption expenditure in the SNA\nof the same year.  The HIES estimate constitutes 91 percent of the NA estimate. In the succeeding\nyear, 1995-1996, the estimated household consumption expenditure of Tk 1,068,870 million in the\nHIES was 79.6 percent of the Tk 1,342,157 million of private consumption expenditure in the national\naccounts. In 2000, the HIES estimate was 66.9 percent of the NA estimate. The discrepancy has narrowed\nover the years.\nIt should be noted that in the national accounts, private consumption expenditure consists\nof the value of final consumption expenditure on goods and services of households and final consumption\nexpenditure of private nonprofit institutions serving households. Further, national accounts estimates\ncover all types of households, not just residential dwellings but including institutions such as dormitories,\nrooming houses, prisons, hospitals, etc. In comparison, the household consumption expenditure recorded\nin the HIES covers only households in their residential dwellings.\nThe foregoing explains the existence of the discrepancy. But what explains the steady narrowing\nof the discrepancy?  Facts are scarce but one explanation is that the improvement in the coverage\nof the national accounts after SNA 1993 resulted in the increase of the number of nonprofit institutions\nserving households covered and in the consequent expansion of private consumption expenditure.\nSince then, the number of nonprofit institutions serving households has steadily declined and the\ncorresponding private consumption expenditure has gradually fallen.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nThe data collected from HIES Rounds from 1985-1986 to 2000 suggest that both income and\nexpenditure in Bangladesh increased for the population as a whole, whether in the rural or in the\nurban areas. However, the distribution of income deteriorated, with the gap between lower-income\nand higher-income groups widening in the last decade and a half. The same can be said of\nexpenditure, whose distribution also worsened during the period.\nBangladesh has used all commonly known methodologies for the measurement of poverty.\nIn early years Bangladesh used mainly the direct calorie intake method of poverty line estimation,\nand a little later the food energy intake method. Since the mid-1990s it has switched to the cost\nof basic needs method.  Strictly speaking, the setting up of an official poverty line requires the conduct\nof studies to establish the relationships of energy intake (expressed in kilo calories) with height-\nweight, age, working status, etc., of the population. Such relationships will permit the establishment\nof the threshold calorie norm for the population as a whole.  However, this sort of data is not available\nin Bangladesh. At present Bangladesh uses the norm of 2122 kcal for individuals recommended by\nthe Food and Agriculture Organisation for the estimation of the poverty line.\nThe poverty lines, based on the estimated cost of the 2122 kcal of food for individuals and\nan element of nonfood requirements was arrived at through the CBN method. Following the CBN method,\nthe head count ratio showing the percentage of people whose consumption expenditure fell below\nthe poverty line was 49.8 percent (using upper poverty line) in 2000. This was an improvement,\nthough a modest one, over the 51.0 percent of 1995-1996. For the rural areas, the ratio was 53.1\npercent in 2000, an improvement over the 55.3 percent of 1995-1996 For the urban areas, however,\nthe trend was a deterioration, 36.6 percent in 2000 as against 29.5 percent in 1995-1996.\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 54 17", "PRACTICES OF POVERTY MEASUREMENT AND POVERTY PROFILE OF BANGLADESH\nFAIZUDDIN AHMED\nNationwide, for the population in poverty, the poverty gap, or the shortfall of actual\nconsumption expenditure from the consumption expenditure as defined by the poverty line, was\n12.9 percent in 2000, an improvement over the 13.3 percent of 1995-1996. The trend was the\nsame in the rural areas but was the reverse in the urban areas.  In the rural areas, the poverty\ngap was 13.8 percent in 2000, compared to 14.6 percent in 1995-1996. In the urban areas, the\ngap was 9.5 percent in 2000, a marked deterioration over the 7.2 percent of 1995-96.\nThe squared poverty gap, an indicator of the severity of poverty, also declined from 1995-\n1996 to 2000, suggesting an improvement in the welfare of the poor in the country.\nAs regards other poverty related indicators, the situation is improving over time. The infant\nmortality rate for both sexes fell over the period 1990-2001. The net school enrolment rate for both\nsexes increased, though fell slightly for children aged 11-15 years in the period 1995-2000.\nFrom the data it can be concluded that poverty is being alleviated in Bangladesh, although\nslowly. The infant mortality rate and the school enrolment rate, nonincome poverty indicators, are\nmoving in the desired direction, downward and upward, respectively. One can only hope that the\ntrend can be accelerated in the future so that the blight of poverty is substantially diminished if\nnot totally banished in Bangladesh sooner rather than later.\n18 AUGUST 2004", "APPENDIX A\nCOST OF BASIC NEEDS METHOD\nAPPENDIX A\nCOST OF BASIC NEEDS METHOD\nThe Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) 2000 uses two methods for estimating poverty: the\ndirect caloric intake (DCI) method and the cost of basic needs (CBN) method. Under the DCI method, a household\nwith a per capita caloric intake of less than 1805 kcal per day is considered as \u201chard core poor\u201d while a\nhousehold with less than 2122 kcal per day is considered as \u201cabsolute poor.\u201d Under the CBN method, to be\nconsidered as poor, a household must have a per capita expenditure below a given poverty line. This appendix\nfocuses on the steps followed for estimating the poverty lines used in the CBN method. It also discusses various\nmeasures for estimating the number of the poor or the intensity of their poverty (head count ratio, poverty\ngap, and squared poverty gap measures).\nA. The Cost of Basic Needs Method\nWith the CBN method, poverty lines represent the level of per capita expenditure at which the members of\nhouseholds can be expected to meet their basic needs (food consumption to meet their caloric requirement and\nnonfood consumption). Making comparisons of poverty rates over time requires that the basic-needs bundles\nused to estimate poverty lines in different years are of constant value in real terms. In order to ensure this, CBN\npoverty lines were first estimated for a base year, chosen to be 1991-1992, and then updated to 1995-1996 and\n2000 for changes in the cost-of-living using a price index. As prices of some goods and services may vary\nbetween geographical areas in Bangladesh, poverty lines were estimated at a desegregated level. Specifically,\n1\nthe country was divided into 14 different geographic areas (nine urban and five rural).  The method followed\nfor estimating the 1991-1992 regional CBN poverty lines and the price indices are described below.\n1. Estimating the Base Year Poverty Lines\nThree steps were followed for estimating what it costs a household to meet its basic needs in the base year.\nFirst, the cost of a fixed food bundle was estimated. The bundle consists of 11 items: rice, wheat, pulses, milk,\noil, meat, fresh water fish, potato, other vegetables, sugar, and fruits. It provides minimal nutritional requirements\ncorresponding to 2122 kcal per day per person, the same threshold used to identify the absolute poor under the\ndirect calorie intake method. Prices for each item in the bundle were estimated for each of the 14 geographic\nareas. In order to capture the price paid by the poor for each food item, regressions were used to control for the\nimpact of household characteristic such as total consumption, education, and occupation on the quality of the\nfood consumed (better-off households buy more expensive food than the poor). Denoting the required quantities\nin the food bundle to meet the calorie requirement by (F ,\u2026F ), where F is the required per capita quantity of\n1 N j\nfood item j, food poverty lines were computed as Z = SP F. In this equation, the nutritional needs are the\nkf jk j\nsame for all areas, but the prices for each item are area-specific, with the subscript k referring to area k.\nThe second step involved computing two nonfood allowances for nonfood consumption. The first was obtained\nby taking the amount spent on nonfood items by those households whose total consumption was equal to their\nfood poverty line Z These households spend less on food than the food poverty line. Hence what they spend\nkf. \non nonfood items must be devoted to bare essentials. Algebraically, denoting total per capita consumption by\ny and food per capita consumption by x, the \u201clower\u201d allowances for non-food consumption were estimated as\nZL = E[y \u2013 x I y Z ] where E is the expectation statistical symbol. Second, \u201cupper\u201d allowances for nonfood\nkn  i  i  i  =  kf \nconsumption were estimated by taking the amount spent on nonfood items by those households whose food\nexpenditure was equal to the food poverty line (these households do meet their food requirement). These upper\nallowances for nonfood items can be expressed as ZU  = E[y \u2013 x I x = z  ]. Because the share of food\nkn  i i i kf\nexpenditure in total consumption decreases as consumption increases, Zu is larger than ZL .\n kn  kn\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 54 19", "PRACTICES OF POVERTY MEASUREMENT AND POVERTY PROFILE OF BANGLADESH SECTION V\nFAIZUDDIN AHMED KEY ISSUES\nThe third step in the estimation of the poverty lines consisted of simply adding to the food poverty lines the\nlower and upper nonfood allowances to yield the total lower and upper poverty lines for each of the 14\ngeographical areas.\nLower poverty line: ZL  = Z +ZL  where ZL = E[y-x Iy=Z ]\nk kf kn kn  i i i kf\nUpper poverty line: ZU  = Z +ZU , where Zu  = E[y-x Ix-Z ]\nk kf kn kn i i i kf\nThus, within each area, the estimates of the cost of basic food needs in the lower and upper poverty lines are\nthe same. The difference between the two lines is due to the difference in the allowances for nonfood consumption.\nThe lower poverty line incorporates a minimal allowance for nonfood goods (the typical nonfood spending of\nthose who could just afford the food requirement) while the upper poverty line makes a more generous allowance\n(the typical nonfood spending of those who just attained the food requirement).\n2. Updating Poverty Lines for Changes in Cost of Living\nPrice indices for updating the 1991-1992 CBN poverty lines to 1995-1996 and 2000 were derived by combining\nprice information available in the HIES data sets and the nonfood CPI. The HIES data provide price information\non food items and fuels that account for approximately two thirds of total household expenditure. Inflation of\nnonfoods that cannot be calculated from the HIES surveys was estimated by the nonfood component of the CPI.\nThe HIES-based price indices were derived in four steps. First, expenditure on various items in the HIES were\ndivided into 14 groups. These groups were chosen so as to retain as much desegregation as possible (to\nminimize heterogeneity within categories) as well as to be comparable across the three survey years. Second,\nunit values (arrived at by dividing expenditures by quantity) of the most commonly consumed item within each\nof the expenditure groups were calculated for each household. For each group, the median of the unit values\nwithin each geographic region was calculated. Using the price of the most commonly consumed item within\neach group and medians (which are more robust to outliers as compared to means) for the summary region-\nspecific unit values helped minimize the problem that the calculated unit values are contaminated by choice of\nquality rather than providing information on market price alone. Third, average budget shares of the 14 main\nexpenditure groups were calculated for each survey year. Finally, region-specific Tornqvist price indexes were\nthen calculated using budget shares of the expenditure groups along with median prices of the selected items.\nThe Tornqvist price indices for each region k were calculated as follows:\nlnPTK =\u2211n W1kj +W0kj ln\uf8ee\uf8efP1kj \uf8f9\uf8fa\n10 j=1 2 \uf8ef\uf8f0P0kj \uf8fa\uf8fb\nTk  k\nwhere P denotes the Tornqvist price index for region k, 1 and 0 denote the two years of comparison, W  1 and\nk k k j \nW  0 are the respective budget shares, and p  1 and p  0 are the respective prices for good j in the two years\nj j  j\nof comparison.\nOnce the HIES-based price indexes for each region had been derived from the survey data, a weighted average\nof these and the nonfood CPI (desegregated by urban and rural sectors) was taken to derive region-specific\ncost-of-living indices for 1995-1996 and 2000, the relative weights being the budget shares of covered goods in\neach region for the HES price index, and the balance (i.e., the number one minus these budget shares) for the\nnonfood consumer price index. The composite price indices were then used to update the 1991-1992 CBN\npoverty lines to 1995-1996 and 2000.\n20 AUGUST 2004", "APPENDIX A\nCOST OF BASIC NEEDS METHOD\nB. Alternative Poverty Measures\nOnce the poverty lines have been estimated, several poverty measures can be used to measure the extent of\n \ndeprivation. These are the so-called Foster-Greer-Thorbecke measures,which include (i) the head count index,\nwhich is simply the percentage of the population living in households with a per capita consumption below the\npoverty line; (ii) the poverty gap index, which measures the average distance separating the poor from the\npoverty line as a proportion of the line (with a zero distance allocated to the households who are not poor);\n(iii) and the squared poverty gap index, a measure of the severity of poverty, which takes into account not only\nthe distance separating the poor from the poverty line but also the extent of inequality among the poor.\nERD WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 54 21", "PRACTICES OF POVERTY MEASUREMENT AND POVERTY PROFILE OF BANGLADESH\nFAIZUDDIN AHMED\nAPPENDIX B\nPRICE INDICES
