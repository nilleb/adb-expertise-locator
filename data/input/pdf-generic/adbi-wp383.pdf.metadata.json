INTRODUCTION \n\nHigh  level  of  indebtedness  in  advanced  economies  is  not  a  new  phenomenon. In fact,  at  the \nonset  of  the  current  Global  Financial  Crisis  (GFC)  in  2007,  most  advanced  economies  had \nsignificantly  high  debt  levels,  way  in  excess  of  the  commonly  accepted  60%  threshold.  Yet, \nthese  high  debt  levels  did  not  trigger  fundamental  debt  sustainability  concerns  and  investor \nnervousness. Growth projections conveyed a very solid medium-term economic outlook. Most \nearly  warning  and  risk  indicators  did  not  predict  that  the  following  years  would  be  radically \ndifferent from a sovereign credit risk angle. What influenced such a benign outlook and why did \nvarious actively used models not identify \u201csovereign risk\u201d until after it got amplified and led to a \ndisruption in global sovereign debt markets? Did the policymakers have the right set of tools to \nact preventively and fix the system before concerns relating to sovereign credit risk fed into the \nreal economy?  \n\nThe complex network of direct and indirect interconnections between the balance sheets of a \nsovereign  with  those  of  the  corporate,  households,  and  banks  and  non-banking  institutions \ncalls  for  a  broader  approach  towards  identifying  and  measuring  sovereign  risk.  At  the  same \ntime, there is no silver bullet in managing sovereign risk. A full policy menu is needed that goes \nbeyond  the  traditional  monetary  and  fiscal  policy  mix  and  explicitly  takes  into  account  the \nmacro-financial  aspects  of  sovereign  credit  risk  that  propagate  and  magnify  its  negative \neffects,  particularly  those  relating  to  financial  stability.  Perhaps,  a  new  office  of  a  Sovereign \nRisk Officer (SRO) could be set up whose main tasks would be the review and the assessment \nof  risks  affecting  a  sovereign\u2019s  credit  standing  and  to  advise  the  pertinent  policymakers  on \nremedial measures. The SRO is similar to the Chief Risk Officer found in many financial firms, \nwhere (s)he is usually responsible for the three categories of risks: market risk, credit risk, and \noperational risks.  \n\nIn Section 1 below we discuss the holistic concept of sovereign credit risk that incorporates the \nmacro-financial aspects. Section 2 discusses the financial stability dimension of sovereign risk \nand the related transmission channels. Section 3 discusses the existing measures being used \nto capture sovereign risk and their limitations. Section 4 looks at policy responses, and Section \n5 concludes by highlighting challenges ahead and points at some open questions and issues \nfor further examination. \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 383 \n \n\n \n\n      Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n\n2.  MOVING TO A MACRO-FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE OF \n\nSOVEREIGN RISK \n\nA key legacy of the GFC is the realization that sovereign risk is far more than just a pure fiscal \nrisk. The analysis of sovereign risk needs to go well beyond the traditional debt sustainability \napproach to encompass the complex net of macro-financial interactions (Figure 1).  \n\nFigure 1: Debt Sustainability and Macro-Financial Perspective \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCapital \nMarket \nInfrastructure\n\nRegulatory \nFramework\n\nContingent \nLiabilities\n\nMACRO-FINANCIAL\nPERSPECTIVE\n\nALM \nApproach\n\nInvestor \nBase\n\n \n\nPrimary \nExpenditure\n\nInterest \nRate\n\nDebt \nStock\n\nEconomic \nGrowth\n\nDEBT\nSUSTAINABILITY\n\nTax\nRevenue \n\n \n\nSource: IMF staff. \n\n \n\n2.1  Pre-crisis Debt Outlook and Medium-term Macro Projections \n\nThe  sole  focus  on  sovereign  solvency  risks  in  the  early  2000s  missed  the  importance  of  the \ndirect and contingent intertwining of cross-sectoral balance sheets with that of the sovereign. \nThis  aspect  has  played  a  crucial  role  in  a  number  of  country  cases  caught  in  the  direct \nheadwind  of  the  GFC.  At  the  onset  of  the  crisis,  debt  sustainability  in  advanced  economies \nwas not an issue despite their sovereign debt levels being well above 60% of GDP in a number \nof  cases  (Figure  2).  On  average,  the  euro  area\u2019s  sovereign  debt  hovered  around  69%  of \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2000\u201307.  2007  outstanding  public  debt  levels  of  Italy, \nGreece, and Belgium were projected to be 105%, 85%, and 79% of GDP, respectively.  \n\nIn 2007, financial markets were stable and the projected medium-term macroeconomic outlook \nof  these  highly-indebted  economies  suggested  nothing  but  stability  and  solid  growth.  For \n \n4 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 383 \n \n\n \n\n      Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n\ninstance,  for  the  euro  area,  the World  Economic  Outlook  (WEO)  growth  projections  made  in \n2007 for the period 2007\u201311 averaged 4.2%, and showed a path of smooth debt consolidation. \nThe  2007  housing  market  downturn  in  the  Unites  States  (US)  and  the  subsequent  GFC, \nhowever,  led  to  significant  downward  revisions  of  the  projected  debt  consolidation  trend  and \nthe macroeconomic outlook (Figure 3). In 2011, the euro area\u2019s stock of sovereign debt surged \nby 40 percentage points relative to the 2007 levels, and nominal GDP growth rates cut back to \n1.5%. \n\nFigure 2: Public Debt to GDP Ratio \n\n \n\n \n\n \n(In percent of GDP)\n180\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3: 2011 GDP Growth \nProjections \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(WEO  projections made in 2007 and 2011)\n6.0\n\n2007\n\n2011\n\n4.0\n\n2.0\n\n0.0\n\n-2.0\n\n-4.0\n\n-6.0\n\nGreece Ireland Portugal Spain\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nItaly Belgium France\nUS\nSource : IMF, Fiscal Monitor (September \n2011). \n\nUK\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGreece Ireland Portugal Spain\n\nItaly Belgium France\n\nUK\n\nUSA\n\n \n\nSource: IMF, World Economic Outlook. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProjection in 2007\n\nProjection in 2011\n\n150\n\n120\n\n90\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\nThe  shift  in  confidence  and  market  expectations  in  future  events,  not  purely  macro  fiscal \nvariables, thus played a key role in determining the public debt trajectory going forward.1\n The \ncontinuous  revisions  of  some  advanced  economies\u2019  sovereign  debt  ratios  and  growth \nprojections  validated  the  market  perception  that  advance  economy  sovereigns  are  no  longer \nrisk  free.  Stronger  inter-linkages  between  sovereigns\u2019  and  banks\u2019  balance  sheets,  combined \nwith  the  deterioration  of fiscal  and real  sector  outlooks,  contributed  to further  exacerbation of \nthe perception of sovereign credit risk among advanced economies. \n\n2.2  From narrow Debt Sustainability to a Broader Macro-financial \n\nPerspective  \n\nOften, sovereign risk is referred to as risk to debt sustainability of a country, i.e., the probability \nthat  debt  ratios  may  cross  a  certain  threshold. 2\n  Under  this  purely  macro-fiscal  approach, \n                                                \n1\n See Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) for more discussion. \n\n2\n Aizenman et al. (2011) look at the past and current fiscal space (defined in terms of levels of debt and deficits \n\nrelative to tax revenues) to measure sovereign risk in a number of European countries that are currently facing \n\npressures. Gray et al. (2008) propose extending the notion of debt sustainability to control for the risks associated \n5 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 383 \n \n\n \n\n      Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n\nsovereign risk is defined as solvency risk measured in terms of primary expenditure, stock of \nnominal debt, and tax revenue. In a debt sustainability analysis approach, which examines the \nnet present value of future debt flows, market and investor factors enter into the equation only \nthrough  the  discount  variable.  The  qualitative  aspects  of  the  composition  of  the  debt  stock, \nthrough which market expectations operate, are mostly neglected. \n\nReliance  on  a  fiscal  approach  to  sovereign  risk,  while  important,  becomes  too  narrow  to \naddress  the  macro-financial  stability  challenges  that  sovereigns  confront.  It  is  now  well \naccepted that,  with  the evolution  and  deepening  of global  and  domestic capital  markets,  and \nthe entwining of the sovereign and financial sectors\u2019 balance sheets in developed markets, the \nnotion of sovereign risk has to inevitably expand to cover a much larger set of risk factors.3\n To \ncite a few, the sovereign risk analysis needs to capture risks deriving from the debt structure \nand  its  composition,  the  existing  capital  market  infrastructure,  the  regulatory  framework,  the \ncomposition of the investor base of the country (beyond the share of non-resident to resident \ndebt  holders),  and  the funding  conditions  of  systemically  important  corporations  and financial \nfirms, among others.  \n\nInadequate policy responses in preventing and managing a sovereign credit crisis in a timely \nmanner can be explained by misperceptions about the nature of sovereign risk. The excessive \nfocus  on  traditional  macro-fiscal  risk  indicators  and  a  poor  understanding  of  the  financial \nstability and capital market implications for the sovereign balance sheet may contribute to the \nmispricing  of  sovereign  assets  pre-crisis.  Weak  macro-prudential  and  regulatory  framework \nand sovereign debt management practices also lay the ground for a faster, broader, and more \namplified spread of market anxiety. \n\n                                                                                                                                                        \n\nwith sovereign assets and liabilities. Under the contingent claims approach, Gray et al. (2007) link sovereign \n\ncredit risk to the probability the asset value falls below the distress barrier (i.e., the present value of promised \n\npayments.). Garcia and Rigobon (2004) extend the debt accumulation equation to incorporate the stochastic \n\nfeatures of key macroeconomic variables (e.g., the real interest rate, GDP, exchange rate, and inflation) and \n\ndefine credit risk as the probability the debt will reach a threshold in a certain period of time.   \n\n3\n Cottarelli (2011a) defines rollover risks or fiscal sustainability risks as the probability that the move of certain fiscal \n\nindicators into dangerous territory, or other form of shocks, will trigger a negative market response. This concept \n\nrelies on three dimensions: (1) basic fiscal variables that are often captured under the basic fiscal solvency \n\nanalyses; (2) the composition of sovereign asset and liabilities and its management; (i.e., rollover needs, maturity \n\nstructure, and global market risks) and (3) factors affecting long-term fiscal trends. Baldacci et al. (2011) \n\nformulate the fiscal stress index using the notion of crises events that fall into one of four criteria: (i) sovereign \n\ndebt default or restructuring; (ii) IMF-program with more than a 100% quota access; (iii) very high inflation; and \n\n(iv) very high sovereign bond yields. \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 383 \n \n\n2.3  Defining Sovereign Risk \n\n \n\n      Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n\nDespite its popular use since 2009, there is little consensus on how best to define sovereign \nrisk. We propose expanding the concepts advanced in the macro-fiscal and macro-prudential \nliterature to incorporate the macro-financial risks that sovereigns encounter. Sovereign risk is a \ncomplex  combination  of  risks  that  feed  through  a  number  of  channels  into  the  sovereign \nbalance  sheet  in  a  non-monotonic  fashion  (Figure  4).  For  instance,  credit  risk  from  systemic \nfinancial institutions will  channel through the contingent liabilities component of the sovereign \nbalance  sheet,  whereas  market  risk  will  affect  the  fiscal  revenue  and  international  reserves \ncomponents. \n\nFigure 4: Defining Sovereign Risk \n\nSource : IMF staff. \n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 383 \n \n\n \n\n      Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n\nUsing a balance sheet approach, sovereign risk can be defined as the probability of a \nsignificant deterioration of the sovereign\u2019s balance sheet, either via increased vulnerabilities in \nthe domestic market (financial sector, sovereign credit market, real sector, the external sector), \nand/or vulnerabilities in foreign markets that spillover to the country. More formally: \n\nSovereign risk = Probability (event) \u2265 Threshold \n\n\u2261 Prob ( A < AThreshold \u222a L > LThreshold \u222a K < KThreshold\n\n ) \u222a Threshold \n\n(1) \n\nwhere A stands for assets, L for liabilities, and K for net debt or net worth of the country. \n\nThe  deterioration  of  the  balance  sheet  could  be  explained  by  a  weakening  of  the  asset  side \nand/or a surge of the sovereign liabilities of the country. It could be driven by a factor(s) that \nincrease(s)  the  value  of  the  sovereign  liabilities  of  the  country  and/or  reduces  the  value  of \nsovereign assets, and that, as a result, cause(s) the balance sheet to worsen. The dynamics of \nthe  asset  side  will  vary  significantly,  country  by  country,  and  depend  on  particular \ncircumstances. For instance, in the case of fixed assets, the value and liquidity of public real \nestate  properties  may  significantly  worsen  during  periods  of  stress.  Also,  assets  from  oil-rich \neconomies will be significantly affected by changes in the oil and related commodity markets. \nFurther,  the  notion  of  being  \u201csignificant\u201d  can  be  seen  as  country-specific.  For  instance, \neconomies  with  a  history  of  default  may  suffer  from  higher  risk  aversion  (Eichengreen  and \nHausmann  1999)  and  therefore  their  \u201csignificant\u201d  may  mean  less  than  for  countries  with  no \ndefault history. A conceptualization of \u201csignificant\u201d would require testing the complex net of risk \nindicators (e.g., liquidity and solvency ratios) against some pre-determined threshold values.  \n\n2.4  Sovereign Risk as a Composite of Risks: Conceptual Framework \n\nSovereign risk is a complex blend of risk factors that spread into the sovereign balance sheet \nin  a  non-monotonic  fashion  through  a  variety  of  channels.  Sovereign  risk  encompasses  (i) \ndomestic  sovereign  risk  emanating  directly  from  the  sovereign  balance  sheet,  (ii)  domestic \nnegative  feedback  risk  originating  from  the  impact  of  systemic  institutions  on  the  sovereign \nbalance sheet and, (iii) cross-border risks spilling over from foreign economies countries to the \nsovereign balance sheet. Formally, equation (1) can be re-written as the combination of risks \nat play as a result of the expansion of linkages across sectors and countries (see Figure 1): \n\nSovereign risk \u2261 F ( riski,d, sov, riski, d, SI, riski, foreign\n\n ) \n\n(2) \n\nwith the impact of event i (i = solvency, liquidity, market, and operational) fueling through the \nsovereign  (sov)  balance  sheet  of  the  domestic  market  d.

These risks are also \na  composite  of  domestic  sovereign  risks,  domestic  negative  feedbacks  from  systemic \ninstitutions, and foreign sovereign risks they are also exposed to (third markets). \n\nrisk\n\ni, f = \u03a6 ( riskf,f,sov, riskf, f, SI, riskf,foreign\n\n ) \n\n(2c) \n\nwhere risk\n\n, risks from foreign sovereigns, is also a function of (i\u2019), its own sovereign risk  \n\ni, f\n\nrisk\n\nf,f,sov = risksolvency,f,sov \u222a riskliquidity,f,sov \u222a risklocal economy,f,sov \u222a risk\n\nother,f,sov \n\n(ii\u2019) the risk deriving from its own systemic institutions,  \n\nriskf, f,SI = risksolvency,f,SI \u222a riskliquidity,f,SI \u222a risklocal economy,f,SI \u222a risk\n\nother,f,SI \n\nand, (iii\u2019) the risk spilling over from third economies,  \n\nriskf,foreign = risksolvency,foreign \u222a riskliquidity,foreign \u222a risklocal economy,foreign \u222a riskother,foreign\n. \n\nBased  on  this  framework,  we  discuss  below  the  various  channels  through  which  these  three \nrisk components amplified and materialized during the GFC. \n\n                                                \n4\n In this context, the local economy risk component refers to financial market risks driven by domestic factors only. \n\nGlobal capital market conditions are mainly considered in the context of cross-over spillovers and the foreign \n\nsources of risks. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 383 \n \n\n \n\n      Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n\n3.  AMPLIFICATION AND MANIFESTATION OF SOVEREIGN \n\nAND FINANCIAL STABILITY RISK \n\nThe  broader  notion  of  sovereign  risk  presented  above  has  surfaced  in  different  forms  during \nthe crisis. It is, however, most evident in the context of financial stability, with the tightening of \nthe sovereign and banking sector balance sheets and the larger exposures to external shocks \nthrough  financial  channels.  The  dynamics  of  global  investment,  through  changes  in  the \ninvestor base and capital flows\u2019 composition, illustrates the transmission of sovereign risk from \none country to another and its global implications.  \n\n3.1  Sovereign-Bank Inter-linkages: Concepts and Channels \n\nSovereign  credit  risk  can  fuel  through  both  sides  of  banks\u2019  balance  sheet  (e.g.,  through  the \nloan  portfolio  and  financing),  resulting  in  negative  feedback  loop  (Figure  5).  It  is  transferred \nthrough  various  channels  (Merler  and  Pisani-Ferry  2012)  including  (i)  mark-to-market  losses \non sovereign bond holdings; and (ii) an increase in bank funding costs caused by the re-pricing \nof  risk,  including  credit  rating  downgrades  and  higher  haircuts  in  liquidity  assistance from  the \ncentral bank. Moreover, bank funding pressures could lead to government guarantees on bank \nsecurities to be called, thus increasing the sovereign debt burden. In the GFC, direct support \nfrom  the  sovereign  to  the  financial  sector  in  a  selected  number  of  advanced  economies \naveraged about 6.8% of GDP, but the range is ample. In the case of Ireland, for example, the \nIrish government support to the domestic banking sector reached 41% of GDP (IMF 2011b). \n\nFigure 5: Sovereign-Banking Sector Linkage \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMark-to-market risk\nBank funding cost\n\nGovernment\ncontingent\nliabilities\n\nSimilar\nsovereigns\nunder\npressure\n\nRating \nagencies,\nInvestor \nbase,\netc \u2026\n\nMark-to-market risk\n\nMark-to-market risk\nBank funding cost\n\nSOVEREIGN\nA\n\nSOVEREIGN\nB\n\nBANKING\nSYSTEM\nA\n\nBANKING\nSYSTEM\nB\n\nCounterparty\ncredit\nrisk\n\nRating \nagencies,\nInvestor \nbase,\netc \u2026\n\n \n\n \nSource: IMF Staff. \n\n \n \n\n  10 \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 383 \n \n\n \n\n      Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n\nThe  strengthening  of  linkages  between  the  sovereign  and  domestic  banks\u2019  balance  sheets \nfurther increased the two-way shocks\u2019 transmission channel. As such, two-way spillover effects \nmay reinforce each other, potentially to a point in which implicit government guarantees to the \nbanking  sector  lead  to  value  losses.  The  tightening  of  sovereign-banks\u2019  balance  sheet  inter-\nlinkages  suggests  the  need  for  a  joint  assessment  of  banking  and  sovereign  sectors\u2019 \nvulnerabilities. In the past years, sovereign credit default swaps (CDSs) and bank CDSs in the \nEuropean region showed high correlation, reflecting the market participants\u2019 perceptions on the \nnegative feedback linkages (Figure 6). \n\nFigure 6: European Sovereign and Financial CDS Spreads \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(In bps)\n\n450\n\n400\n\n350\n\n300\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n1.2\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n \n\nSovereigns (LHS)\nFinancials, senior debt (LHS)\nCorrelations (6 month, RHS)\n\nSources: Bloomberg and IMF staff calculations. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA strong nexus between the sovereign and domestic financial institutions can lead to financial \nrisk concentration in the medium- and long-term. In the short run, both banks and sovereigns \nshare  common  interests:  banks\u2019  holdings  of  large  amounts  of  government  bonds  assures \nstable financing for sovereigns, while banks improve their solvency ratios by accumulating low-\nrisk  weighted  government  bonds.  However,  excessive  links  between  the  two  balance  sheets \nmay exacerbate future spillovers and increase their vulnerabilities.  \n\nOn the international channel, the loss of confidence in a sovereign market can cause knock-on \neffects  on  other  distressed  sovereigns  (Claessens  and  Forbes  2001).  These  well-known \ncontagion effects across highly-indebted economies evidenced once more during the GFC.

In  crisis  episodes,  global \ninvestors\u2019  willingness  to  participate  in  sovereign  debt  auctions  tends  to  get  impaired,  raising \nthe  risk  of  auctions  failures.  To  date,  there  have  been  very  few  episodes  of  failing  auctions \nduring  the  GFC  despite  high  refinancing  needs  for  banks  and  sovereigns.  However,  weak \nsovereign and bank balance sheets could still suffer from heightened refinancing risk through \nexcesses in absorption capacity (Figure 8). \n\nGRE\n\nPOR\n\nIRE\n\nSPA\n\nITA\nFRA\nBEL\nAUT\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n  12 \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 383 \n \n\n \n\n      Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n\nFigure 8: Euro area Sovereign Refinancing Risk \n\n Source: Bloomberg. \n\n \n\n3.2 \n\nInvestors\u2019 Perspective: Investor Base and Capital Flows \n\nThe  composition  of  the  investor  base  is  a  key  variable  in  the  analysis  of  sovereign  risk  and \nfinancial  stability.  The  changing  investor  base  is  a  significant  factor  in  determining  the  yield \n(Andritzky  2012).  Further,  Arslanalp  and  Tsuda  (2012)  argue  that  the  composition  of  the \nsovereign  investor  base  can  have  key  policy  implications  on  government  refinancing  risks \n(through a high participation of foreign investors) and domestic financial stability (through the \nincreasing  importance  of  domestic  banks). The  composition  of the  investor  base  can  be  also \nexamined in terms of the diversity of the investor; a more diversified investor base can foster \nsecondary market liquidity, while a disperse investor base could complicate investor relations, \nand in the extreme, post a significant challenge in debt restructuring negotiations (e.g., Greek \nprivate-sector involvement [PSI] negotiation).5\n \n\n                                                \n5\n See Das et al.

Indeed,  the  investor \nbase  of  a  country  mirrors  the  demand  side  of  the  sovereign  debt  dynamics  and  can  play  a \nmajor  role  in  the  loss  of  market  access.6\n  In  particular,  investors\u2019  balance  sheets  mirror  the \nstability  levels  of  market  demand,  since  highly-leveraged  investors  tend  to  liquidate  their \npositions  faster  than  those  with  lower  leverage.  IMF  (2011a)  discusses  evidence  on  the \nsensitivity of investors in the euro area sovereign bond markets, the loss of market access in \nsome  countries  as  well  as  the  large  negative  price  actions  in  Italy  and  Spain  in  2011  H2 \n(Figure 9). Beyond the euro area, Arslanalp and Tsuda (2012) examine the global trend of the \nmajor advanced economies\u2019 investor base and identify the rising proportion of foreign investor \nbase as risks in the future.  \n\nFigure 9: Changes in the Sovereign Investor Base \n\n \nSources: Bank for International Settlements; Quarterly External Debt Statistics database; and IMF staff estimates. \nNote: Program countries include Greece, Ireland, and Portugal. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nInvestors have become more selective in their sovereign credit risk assessments. Prior to the \nGFC, most  investors tended  to  assume that  advanced  economies\u2019  sovereigns  were  risk-free. \nThe debt crisis has, once again, crystallized the wide spectrum of credit risks among various \nsovereigns.  The  novelty  this  time  around  is  that  financial  markets  are  much  more  developed \nand integrated. The compounded set of risks and their magnification are forcing investors to be \nmore  risk-sensitive.  International  banks  are  now  shifting  their  assets  from  once  risk-free \nsovereigns to safer destinations, in particular, those with reserve currency status (Figure 10). \n\n                                                \n6\n Gelos et al.

MEASURING SOVEREIGN RISK  \n\n \n\n \n\nVarious  measures  of  sovereign  risk  are  currently  in  use.  Such  measures  include  default  risk \nextracted  from  CDS  and  bond  spreads,  financial  sector  indicator,  global  risk  indicator,  and \nfiscal  indicator.  None  of  them  captures  the  complex  nature  of  sovereign  risk  by  themselves, \nthus suggesting the need for a more holistic measure.  \n\nMeasuring sovereign risk implies attaching a scalar value to a tail event altering the sovereign \nbalance  sheet.  As  such,  it  implies  attaching  a  value  to  the  probability  of  observing  an \nundesirable development affecting the sovereign balance sheet. This probability is determined \nby  a  number  of  observable  and  unobservable  factors.  The  mis-measurement  of  risks  and  of \ntheir pricing before the GFC is often seen as having altered agents\u2019 risk taking and become a \nsource of financial fragility.  \n\nThere is no consensus among practitioners and economists on how best to measure sovereign \nrisk  from  a  sovereign  balance  sheet  angle.  The  bulk  of  the  literature  on  sovereign  risk  has \nexplicitly  focused  on  a  subset  of  risks  affecting  the  stability  of  the  economy  or  a  number  of \nsectors, prominently the banking sector. We examine several empirical methodologies applied \nby practitioners.  \n\nMarket  perception  extracted  from  CDS  or  bond  spreads.  CDS  or  bond  spreads  to \nbenchmarks  are  often  used  as  an  indicator  of  the  market's  perception  of  sovereign  risk. \nChanges  in  the  market-implied  default  probabilities  extracted  from  5-year  CDS  premia  on \nsovereign  debt  are  often  cited  as  indication  of  changes  in  sovereign  risk.  Another  standard \n\n \n \n\n  16 \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 383 \n \n\n \n\n      Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n\nmeasure  used  by  practitioners  to  track  sovereign  risk  is  spreads  of  sovereign  bond  prices  to \nrisk-free  bond  prices  (bunds  in  the  European  Union  (EU)  market,  US  bonds  in  the  Latin \nAmerican context, or swaps more in general), Drawbacks of the CDS methodology, however, \nrelate  to  its  sensitivity  to  liquidity  conditions  in  the  CDS  market  itself  and  uncertainty  in  the \ntriggering of CDS credit events. \n\nFinancial  sector  soundness  indicator.  The  IMF\u2019s  Financial  Sector  Assessment  Program \n(FSAP)  looks  at  the  effects  of  some  components  of  sovereign  risk  on  the  financial  sector. \nRecent  FSAPs  have  sharpened  their  focus  to  incorporate  the  impact  of  sovereign  debt \nholdings  on  the  banking  sector\u2019s  balance  sheet.  The  risk  assessment  relies  on  stressing  the \ncost  of  holding  sovereign  instruments  in  the  different  bank  accounts  and  assessing  the \nsensitivity  of  banks\u2019  positions  when  imposing  more  stringent  sovereign  spread  assumptions. \nThe tests assume a concentration of exposures to sovereign debt under assumptions that risks \nspill  over  through  other  asset  prices,  asset  volatility  and  the  real  sector  of  the  economy. \nHowever, they do not cover the feedback effect of risk originating from banks\u2019 balance sheets \non the sovereign balance sheet.9, 10\n \n\nGlobal  financial  stability  indicator.  The  IMF\u2019s  Global  Financial  Stability  Report  (GFSR) \nassesses risks facing the economy (macro, credit, funding liquidity, and leverage, among other \ntype of risks) and their impact on global financial stability; sovereign risk is a sub-component. \nThe  \u201csix  ray  map  indicator\u201d  builds  on  four  sets  of  risk  indicators  (macroeconomic,  emerging \nmarkets, credit, and market) and two sets of conditions (monetary and financial, investors\u2019 risk \nappetite),  each  of  which  is  a  constructed  index  summarizing  a  number  of  variables  and \nindicators identified in the literature. \n\nFiscal indicator. The fiscal vulnerability and stress indexes measure fiscal sustainability risks \nby  looking  at  government  roll  over  risks  (Baldacci  et  al.  (2011a,  b)).  The  simple  average  of \nboth indexes is used as a risk score measure to rank fiscal sustainability risks under baseline \npolicy  scenarios.  The  fiscal  vulnerability  index  tries  to  identify  abnormal  increases  in  rollover \nrisks  compared  to  the  same  country\u2019s  medium-term  trends  and  cross-country  averages.  The \nfiscal stress index tries to measure the probability of a tail event resulting from hikes in fiscal \nvariables  risks  (e.g.,  adjusted  primary  balance,  population  aging,  or  expenditure  pressures) \nand  asset  and  liability  management  risks  (e.g.,  risks  resulting  from  the  currency  and  non-\nresident investor base composition of the stock of debt.)  \n                                                \n9\n The FSAP work is based on extreme but plausible scenarios guided by past history of the country, including on \n\ndefault episodes. They produce economic assessments on the vulnerabilities of the economy that may differ from \n\nthose resulting from a regulatory approach. The treatment of issues such as bank capital, liquidity and maturity \n\nrisks based on the country\u2019s regulatory framework may differ from that resulting from economic analysis. \n\n In a similar vein, over the years the Bank of England has developed an analytical risk assessment approach to \n\nfinancial stability. Their approach also builds on a number of identified vulnerabilities to the UK\u2019s financial sector, \n\nincluding those propagating through the public sector. The focus, however, is the banking sector (Bank of \n\n  17 \n\n \n\n10\n\n \n \n\nEngland 2007). \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 383 \n \n\n \n\n      Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n\nOur  brief  summary  of  currently-existing  risk  metrics  reveals  the  absence  of  a  standardized \nindicator of sovereign risk. Some indicators discussed above include elements of sovereign \nrisk (as defined in Section 2), but either fail to capture its complex nature or mix it with other \nglobal  risks  (going  beyond  sovereign  risk).  Going  forward,  there  is  demand  for  a  \u201cmapping\u201d \napproach, \nin  a \ncomprehensive manner.  \n\nindicators  (that  explain  sovereign  risk) \n\nthat  permits  analyzing  risk \n\n5.  THE POLICY RESPONSE  \n\nAs  the  concept  of  sovereign  risk  progressively  drifts  away  from  narrow  debt  sustainability \nanalysis  to  a  more  complex  network  of  macro-financial  interactions,  so  should  too  the \nappropriate  policy  response.  With  the  debt  profile  depending  on  a  broad  range  of  financial \nvariables  (including  the  structure  and  composition  of  the  debt,  the  evolving  nature  of  the \ninvestor  base  and  cross-border  spillover  effects),  a  debt  trajectory  target  also  needs  to  be \ndesigned  controlling  for  financial  market  factors.  Policies  exclusively  focused  on  fiscal \naggregates  risk  exacerbates  the  adverse  loop  between  investor  confidence  and  demand  for \nfinancial assets, and may ultimately dampen economic activity. \n\nThe GFC highlights the need for revisiting the approach to sovereign risk management, both at \nnormal  and  crisis  prevention  phases.  Sovereign  risk  management  in  normal  times  calls  for \nmanaging the stock of debt in a way that provides insurance against a broad range of shocks, \nfor  instance,  by  achieving  low  rollover  profiles  and  building  up  sufficiently  large  cash  buffers. \nAlso,  crisis  prevention  calls  for  internalizing  exposures  on  contingent  liabilities  and  potential \nfeedback effects, and for structuring the stock of debt as to isolate it against negative shocks.  \n\nGiven  high  integration  of  financial  markets,  only  a  comprehensive  and  coherent  policy  menu \nencompassing  the  sovereign-financial  sector-foreign  spillovers\u2019  linkages  can  tilt  the  balance \nback towards a good equilibrium. Restoring a good equilibrium encompasses a \u201ccrisis\u201d policy \nmix with a solid back stopping facility that covers all members of the union, credible financing \ninstruments to achieve burden sharing, a clear role of the central bank in the crisis resolution \nframework, and an early commitment to correcting existing frictions in the market structure. \n\n5.1  The Multiple Equilibrium Risk: Tilting the Balance to the Good \n\nEquilibrium \n\nDriven by weak balance sheets and affected heavily by expectations, debt capital markets can \nbe  prone  to  multiple  equilibria.  The  bad  equilibrium  is  usually  triggered  by  market  perception \nthat sovereigns are vulnerable. A loss of investor confidence leads to higher market volatility, \nerosion  of  demand  for  financial  assets,  and  an  unstable  investor  base.  As  a  result,  funding \ncosts  surge.  If  taking  systemic  dimensions,  these  pervasive  dynamics  will  install  into  the \n \n  18 \n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 383 \n \n\n \n\n      Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n\ncountry\u2019s  real  sector  economic  activity  and  feed  backwards  into  further  loss  of  market \nconfidence  (Figure  12).11\n  A  vicious  circle  channeled  through  financial  markets  sets  in  and  is \ndifficult to break. \n\nFigure 12: Illustration of Multiple Equilibria \n\n \n\nSources: IMF, Global Financial Stability Report, September 2011. \n\n \nDuring  bad  times,  financial  market  integration  helps  catalyze  and  morph  risks  faster  and \ndeeper  into  the  economic  structures.  Similar  adverse  dynamics  may  develop  in  other  non-\nEuropean  advanced  markets  or  emerging  markets.  Benefiting  from  a  perception  of  relatively \nsafe assets, emerging markets have so far been isolated from pressures. However, spill-over \nchannels makes them vulnerable to financing stress through potential sharp outflows of capital \nor changes in investor demand. In any of these cases, only adequate policy response can tilt \nthe balance towards the good equilibrium. \n\n5.2  Managing Risk through a Crisis\u2014Crisis Prevention \n\nThe  broader  concept  of  sovereign  risk  that  has  come  with  the  crisis  highlights  the  need  to \nrevisit the risk management approach (Figures 13 and 14 and Principle 8 in Annex). Important \ninteractions between macroeconomic vulnerabilities and sovereign debt structures have been \nmissed  under  the  traditional  cost-risk  debt  management  analysis.  Once  sovereign  stress \nsurfaces, there are three broad sovereign risk management approaches to tilting the balance \n\n                                                \n11\n\n The good equilibrium is not immune to future negative debt dynamics. For instance, a lower interest rate may \n\ninduce private sector investors to pursue higher leverage again, as observed in the Great Moderation. \n\n \n \n\n  19 \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 383 \n \n\n \n\n      Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n\nto  a  good  equilibrium  (see  next  sub-section):  (i)  changing  the  issuance  mix;  (ii)  adapting \nfinancing  modalities;  and  (iii)  stepping  up  market  management  operations.  Typically,  the \ndesign of the preferred maturity structure of the debt is informed using cost-risk tradeoffs and \nhistorical  outcomes.  A  forward-looking  approach  focusing  on  existing  exposures  and  a  full \nrange  of  risk  factors  (including  in  the  macro-financial  area)  would  have  been  needed  to \nrespond to an event as extreme as the current crisis. \n\nFigure 13: Modeling Sovereign Risk \n\nSource: IMF staff. \n\nFigure 14: Assessment of Sovereign Risk and Sensitivity Concerns \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nMARKET SENSITIVITY CONCERNS\n\nCOMPLETE ASSESSMENT OF SOVEREIGN\nRISK\n\nSource: IMF staff. \n\n \n\n  20 \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 383 \n \n \n\n \n\n      Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n\nIn preventing risk build-up, nontraditional risk exposures also need to be adequately captured \n(see Principle 1 in Annex). Most cost-risk analyses do not consider financing shocks that may \nmaterialize  via  the  activation  of  implicit  financial  sector  contingent  liabilities,  large  quasi-\nsovereign  or  sub-national  debt.  Moreover,  models  do  not  contemplate  shocks  that  may  arise \nfrom  a  sudden  withdrawal  of  investment.  Excessive  reliance  on  foreign  investors,  typically \nmore  sensitive  to  negative  shocks,  may  aggravate  financing  risk  even  further.  Nonresidents \ntend  to  be  more  sensitive  and  reactive  to  events  that  undermine  the  quality  of  the  sovereign \nbalance sheet and to downgrades in credit quality. \n\nThere may be scope to strengthen the resilience of the investor base through changes in the \ndebt  structure.  To  better  understand  the  market  dynamics,  debt  managers  need  to  be \ncognizant  of  the  underlying  motivation  of  the  transactions.  For  instance,  certain  classes  of \ninvestors  may  prefer  specific  instruments  or  issuance  volumes  due  to  their  risk-return \npreferences, transaction size limits, or regulatory constrains. Traditionally, greater issuance of \ninflation-linked  debt  or  longer-dated  debt  appeals  to  institutional  investors,  such  as  pension \nfunds  and  life  insurance  companies,  but  may  not  meet  needs  of  banks  that  prefer  shorter \nduration  in  general.  Reducing  the  concentration  of  investor  type  would  not  only  reduce \nexposure  to  rollover  risk  but  could  also  enhance  market  liquidity  and,  thus,  contribute  to  the \nbroader policy goal of enhancing financial stability. Increasing the participation of the domestic \ninvestors  might  provide  greater  resilience  to  a  sudden  stop  in  market  access,  although  this \ncould  increase  the  risk  associated  with  a  greater  degree  of  interconnection  between  the \ndomestic financial sector and the sovereign. \n\nThe current crisis has highlighted the importance of favorable public debt portfolio structures in \nproviding insurance against a range of shocks (see again Principle 1 in Annex). Since the debt \ncrises  of  the  1990s,  many  emerging  market  economies  put  considerable  emphasis  on \nmitigating rollover risk and external vulnerabilities.12\n This has contributed to their resilience in \nthis  crisis.  For  example,  maintaining  a  low  rollover  profile  helps:  (i)  reduce  the  risk  that  an \ninvestor  strike  will  drive  up  yields;  (ii)  provide  resilience  where  the  exchange  rate  regime \nconstrains policy choices; (iii) reduce the cost of servicing the debt as a consequence of any \ndeterioration  in  creditworthiness;  and  (iv)  make  it  easier  to  absorb  the  financing  impact  of \nreduced tax receipts and an accommodative fiscal policy. \n\nThe appropriate scale of liquidity buffers could also be usefully recalibrated. Liquidity buffers, \nby  providing  access  to  resources  to  meet  redemptions,  can  play  a  similar  role  in  reducing \nrollover  risk.  Some  countries  actively  pre-fund  their  debt  (or  equivalently,  buyback  shorter-\ndated  maturities)  as  part  of  their  ongoing  standard  operations  (e.g.,  Belgium  and  the \nNetherlands).  Whether  and  how  large  a  liquidity  buffer  should  be  established  is  a  policy \n\n                                                \n12\n\n See Anderson, Silva, and Velandia-Rubiano (2010). \n\n  21 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 383 \n \n\n \n\n      Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n\ndecision  to  be  coordinated  across  a  range  of  stakeholders.  Large  buffers  may  raise  new \nchallenges for both government cash management and central bank liquidity management.  \n\n5.3  Managing Risk through a Crisis\u2014Debt Management Policy \n\nThe linkage between public debt management and financial stability is highlighted following the \nGFC (Das, Papaioannou, Pedras, Ahmed, and Surti 2010). Apart from the adoption of specific \nstrategies  that  may  vary  substantially  from  country  to  country,  there  are  three  broad  debt \nmanagement  measures  to  manage  sovereign  risk  during  sovereign  stress  outbursts:  (i) \nchanging the debt issuance mix; (ii) adapting financing modalities; and (iii) stepping up market \nmanagement  operations. 13\n  De  Broeck  and  Guscina  (2011)  discuss  various  crisis-related \nchanges in government debt issuance in European countries.  \n\nCountries may need to expand their use of non-core markets and borrowing instruments. For \nexample, in an effort to flexibly respond to market demand, both Belgium and the Netherlands \nintroduced  a  medium-term  note  (MTN)  program  and  issued  additional  short-term  debt \nsecurities, thus promoting investor diversification. Germany used the benefits of maintaining a \npresence in foreign markets in better times to issue new debt instruments; and in September \n2009 \nforeign  currency  denominated  bond.  Furthermore, \nsupplementary  issuance  plans  that  complement  core  programs  also  helped  raise  additional \n  In  several  countries  (e.g.,  the  Netherlands,  Belgium,  Italy,  and \nfinancing  at  the  margin.\nGermany), smaller issues of off-the-run bonds became a more frequent and significant part of \nthe financing program during the crisis. \n\nits  second  ever \n\nissued \n\nit \n\n14\n\nFinancial  fragility  may  call  for  operational  frameworks  to  adapt  to  new  conditions  both  in  the \nprimary and the secondary markets. As sovereign risk spurs, issuance mechanisms may need \nto be modified to support the primary market. With vulnerable primary dealer balance sheets, \nmechanisms that facilitate a larger participation of investors in primary issues may be needed. \nIn some cases, syndication may be a valid option. In other cases, the format of auctions may \nbe modified to make it more attractive for investors to participate. Although transparency and \npredictability  remain  at  the  core  of  risk  management  practices,  there  are  gains  to  increasing \nflexibility in periods of tension. Greater flexibility may require extending the size and choice of \ndebt  instruments  to  be  issued  through  auctions,  and  adapting  auction  programs  to  changing \nmarket conditions.  \n\nPrimary dealer frameworks also need to remain flexible to market stress. Vulnerabilities in the \nbanking sector impair dealers\u2019 ability to take large positions, leading to a significant decline in \nsecondary  market  liquidity.  Responding  to  challenging  liquidity  conditions,  countries  may \n\n See Das, Papaioannou, and Trebesch (2010) for the effects of sovereign default risk and private sector access to \n\n                                                \n13\n\n IMF 2011c for further discussion. \n\ncapital in emerging markets. \n\n14\n\n \n \n\n  22 \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 383 \n \n\n \n\n      Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n\nchoose  to  relax  or  adapt  market  making  obligations  and  to  consider  changes  as  permanent. \nThe debt managers\u2019 toolkit to enhance market liquidity may also include liability management \noperations,  such  as  debt  exchanges  and  purchases  or  sales  of  off-the-runs.  Their \nimplementation  will  hinge  on  market  circumstances  and  vary  market  to  market.  Often  liability \nmanagement operations are initiated at the request of dealers.  \n\n6.  CONCLUSIONS\u2014CHALLENGES AHEAD AND OPEN \n\nQUESTIONS \n\nWe have yet to fully comprehend the interplay of factors driving sovereign risk. The nature of \nsovereign risk has been transformed in a number of ways since the beginning of the GFC four \nyears ago. Under the conventional view, high levels of debt and fiscal vulnerabilities play key \nroles  in  market  assessments  of  sovereign  risk.  Recent  events,  however,  have  exposed  the \nrelevance of contingent liabilities and the inter-linkages between sovereigns and banks. \n\nFurthermore,  the  GFC  has  evidenced  the  lack  of  appropriate  tools  to  measure  and  manage \nsovereign  risk.  There  is  a  need  for  new  tools  to  monitor  sovereign  risk  as  a  complex  set  of \nrisks.  The  complexity  and  entwining  of  sovereign,  corporate  and  households\u2019  balance  sheets \ncalls  for  a  more  holistic  approach  to  risk  analysis  and  stress  testing  work  that  places  more \nfocus on the inter-linkages and feedback loops embedded in sovereign risk.  \n\nA sovereign risk management office (Das and Lindner 2012) could be set up to oversee and \nassess sovereign risk and vulnerabilities in the economy, and advise the country on remedial \nmeasures. The recommendations issued by this independent institution would inform and feed \ninto the policy mix design of the country authorities. \n\nThe overhauling and strengthening of the global financial system encompassed the adoption of \nseveral  new  regulations  that  could  further  increase  the  demand  for  sovereign  debt.  Basel  III \ncovers two liquidity standards\u2014a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and a net stable financing ratio \n(NSFR) to be introduced after an observation period. For the most part, the additional financing \nneeded  by  banks  to  meet  the  LCR  ratio  requires  more  purchases  of  sovereign  debt.15\n  Also, \nnew  regulations  on  capital  and  risk  weighted  assets  could  also  incentivize  banks  to  shift \ndemand towards safer assets that carry a lower risk weight, increasing demand for sovereign \n\n                                                \n15\n\n Banks may be induced to sell longer-term government bonds to meet the desired NSFR. To this extent, there \n\nmay be certain sell pressure for the government bonds. \n\n  23 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 383 \n \n\n \n\n      Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n\ndebt  further.  The  larger  demand  for  safe  assets  might  also  respond  to  changes  in  the \nregulatory framework for the non-bank financial sector.16\n \n\nThe  new  regulations  may  increase  liquidity  risks  on  the  secondary  and  repo  markets.  The \nregulation-induced demand for sovereign debt, in particular the LCR, risks reducing liquidity in \ndebt  markets  by  requiring  banks  to  hold  relatively  more  government  debt  securities  on  their \nown  balance  sheets,  and  consequently  reduce  the  proportion  available  for  sale.  This  might \nthen  reduce  trading  in  the  secondary  markets,  which  would  also  impede  price  discovery  and \ndistort  market  signals.  Jurisdictions  in  which  the  stock  of  debt  is  not  sufficient  to  cover  the \nincreased  demand  from  banks  to  meet  the  LCR  could  be  the  most  affected  ones.  Other \ncountries with a low stock of sovereign debt may face similar challenges if the new standards \nbecome  part  of  the  Basel  core  principles  and  are  adopted  more  widely.  Furthermore,  the \nadoption of outright leverage ratios that include repos as part of leverage, despite their safety, \ncould make this lending practice too costly.\n\n17\n \n\nFinally,  the  issuance  and  distribution  models  of  public  debt  could  be  at  risk.  The  heightened \nsovereign  risks  in  some  government  bond  markets  may  constrain  primary  dealers\u2019  ability  to \nwarehouse sovereign debt securities. Large financial institutions are reassessing the business \nmodel in dealing with volatile sovereign debt assets, resulting in large yield concessions ahead \nof  government  bond  auctions  and  poor  distribution  of  bids.  Alternative  debt  management \ntechniques may need to be explored. \n\n                                                \n16\n\n For instance, new regulations on money market funds in the US or on insurance companies in Europe. Other \n\nsources of safe assets\u2019 demand could result from lower reliance on credit rating agencies, greater use of central \n\ncounterparties for both repurchase agreements and derivative transactions as collateral. \n\n Collateralized lending in the form of repos is credit risk-free beyond the exposure to the sovereign. However, \n\nregulations on trading and leverage that dis-incentivize repo activity may further reduce liquidity in debt markets. \n\nIn the absence of a well-functioning repo market, government bond markets might become broker markets where \n\nmarket makers neither trade on their own books nor provide continuous pricing. \n\n  24 \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 383 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\n      Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n\nAizenman, J., M.

The  scope  of  debt  management  should  be  defined  in  a  way  that  also  accounts  for  any \nrelevant  interactions  between  the  nature  of  financial  assets,  explicit  and  implicit  contingent \nliabilities, and the structure of the debt portfolio. \n\nThe crisis-related interventions have involved a wide range of debt management operations. In \nsome  instances,  changes  have  taken  place  in  the  structure  and  the  composition  of  the  debt \nportfolio.  It  is  important  that  the  debt  management  strategy  takes  into  account  the  relevant \nvariables and the policy and financial risk implications. \n\n2. Strategic and operational debt management decisions should be supported by relevant \ninformation sharing at the domestic, regional, and global levels. \n\nThe  crisis  has  raised  the  risk  of  financial  stability  spillovers,  including  systemic  cross-border \ncontagion. Therefore, the need for information sharing on materially important aspects, at both \nthe regional and global levels, takes on greater significance. This aspect becomes especially \nimportant  when  the  investor  base  comprises  both  domestic  and  foreign  participants. \nInformation  sharing  should  take  place  among  relevant  public  authorities,  and  where \nappropriate, also with the private sector. \n\n3. Flexibility in market operations should be maintained to minimize execution risk, improve \nprice discovery, relieve market dislocations, and support secondary market liquidity. \n\nIn light of the challenges of issuing and managing increased amounts of debt, debt managers \nshould  retain  sufficient  flexibility  to  adapt  the  debt  issuance  format  and/or  adopt  different \nissuance techniques. They should also be prepared to make timely use of liability management \noperations to alleviate secondary market impairments. In such cases, the following Principle 5 \nshould also be taken into consideration. \n\n                                                \n18\n\n These principles emerged from discussions at the 10th Annual IMF consultations on \u201cPolicy and Operational \n\nIssues facing Public Debt Management,\u201d co-hosted by the Swedish National Debt Office in Stockholm, June \n\n2010. \n\n \n \n\n  27 \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 383 \n \n\nCommunication \n\n \n\n      Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n\n4. Proactive and timely market communication strategies should be maintained to support \na transparent and predictable operational framework for debt management. \n\nEffective  communication  helps  minimize  uncertainty  and  contain  costs  by  providing  investors \nwith  the  necessary  information  required  to  form  expectations  and  manage  investment \ndecisions.  This  also  facilitates  the  smooth  undertaking  of  debt  management  operations, \nincluding primary market issuance. \n\n5. Modifications to the operational toolkits of debt managers should be properly explained. \n\nAs changes are made, debt managers should communicate them to the public clearly and in a \ntimely  fashion.  Where  appropriate,  prior  consultation  with  investors  and  other  stakeholders \nshould  be  undertaken  to  garner  feedback  and  support  for  the  planned  changes,  such  as  the \nintroduction  of  a  new  debt  instrument  or  an  adjustment  to  an  existing  debt  issuance \nmechanism. \n\n6. Communication among debt managers and monetary, fiscal, and financial regulatory \nauthorities should be promoted, given greater inter-linkages across objectives, yet with each \nagency maintaining independence and accountability for its respective role. \n\nThe  higher  levels  of  debt  and  increased  uncertainties  regarding  fiscal,  monetary,  and \nregulatory  policies  imply  the  need  for  close  communication  among  different  agencies  on  all \nrelevant  aspects.  However,  it  is  important  that  these  agencies  retain  their  functional  and \noperational independence in areas for which they are accountable. \n\n7.  A  close  and  continuing  dialogue  with  the  investor  base  should  be  promoted  to  keep \nabreast of its characteristics and preferences. \n\nUnderstanding the nature of the investor base and shifts in the investment philosophy enables \ndebt  managers  to  identify  potential  vulnerabilities  and  new  opportunities,  and  to  offer \ninstruments  that  better  match  investors\u2019  needs.  This  can  have  important  positive  effects  in \nlimiting  funding  disruptions,  mitigating  adverse  funding  conditions,  and  reassuring  that \ninvestors are being treated equitably. \n\nRisk management  \n\n8.  Debt  portfolio  risks  should  be  kept  at  prudent  levels,  while  funding  costs  are  minimized \nover the medium- to long-term. \n\nGiven  the  increased  exposure  to  macroeconomic  and  financial  risks,  a  stronger  emphasis \nshould  be  placed  on  risk  mitigation  than  that  implied  by  traditional  policy  objectives  of  public \ndebt  management.  The  debt  manager  should  have  a  framework  that  helps  identify,  assess, \nand monitor the risks associated with debt management operations. \n \n \n\n  28 \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 383 \n \n\n \n\n      Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n\n9.  When  determining  medium-term  debt  management  strategies,  the  range  of  risk \nfactors considered should be consistent with the broadest definition of the debt portfolio and \nthe associated range of potential scenarios. \n\nThe  main  sources  of  the  risks  to  which  the  sovereign  balance  sheet  is  exposed  should  be \nidentified  and  a  clear  framework  on  how  these  risks  are  managed  should  be  established.  A \ncareful  analysis  of  the  debt  portfolio  should  be  carried  out  on  the  basis of  relevant  economic \nand financial stress scenarios, including the costs and risks of alternative strategies. \n\n10.  Prudent  risk  management  strategies  covering  the  full  range  of  risks  facing \nsovereign debt managers should be adopted and communicated to investors. \n\nIn many cases, the high level of debt is constraining governments\u2019 ability to absorb additional \nrisk  on  their  balance  sheets.  It  is  important  to  maintain  debt  portfolios  that  reduce  the \nsovereign  exposure  to  a  variety  of  financial  risks,  including  refinancing  risk  and  exposure  to \ncontingent liabilities. Debt managers should clearly set out the strategies being adopted to limit \nthese risks and communicate them to the public. \n\n \n \n\n  29 \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n \n", " \n", " \n", "Udaibir  S.
