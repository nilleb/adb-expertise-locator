INTRODUCTION \nHigh level of indebtedness in advanced economies is not a new phenomenon. In fact, at the \nonset of the current Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2007, most advanced economies had \nsignificantly high debt levels, way in excess of the commonly accepted 60% threshold. Yet, \nthese high debt levels did not trigger fundamental debt sustainability concerns and investor \nnervousness. Growth projections conveyed a very solid medium-term economic outlook. Most \nearly warning and risk indicators did not predict that the following years would be radically \ndifferent from a sovereign credit risk angle. What influenced such a benign outlook and why did \nvarious actively used models not identify \u201csovereign risk\u201d until after it got amplified and led to a \ndisruption in global sovereign debt markets? Did the policymakers have the right set of tools to \nact preventively and fix the system before concerns relating to sovereign credit risk fed into the \nreal economy?  \nThe complex network of direct and indirect interconnections between the balance sheets of a \nsovereign with those of the corporate, households, and banks and non-banking institutions \ncalls for a broader approach towards identifying and measuring sovereign risk. At the same \ntime, there is no silver bullet in managing sovereign risk. A full policy menu is needed that goes \nbeyond the traditional monetary and fiscal policy mix and explicitly takes into account the \nmacro-financial  aspects  of  sovereign  credit  risk  that  propagate  and  magnify  its  negative \neffects, particularly those relating to financial stability. Perhaps, a new office of a Sovereign \nRisk Officer (SRO) could be set up whose main tasks would be the review and the assessment \nof risks affecting a sovereign\u2019s credit standing and to advise the pertinent policymakers on \nremedial measures. The SRO is similar to the Chief Risk Officer found in many financial firms, \nwhere (s)he is usually responsible for the three categories of risks: market risk, credit risk, and \noperational risks.  \nIn Section 1 below we discuss the holistic concept of sovereign credit risk that incorporates the \nmacro-financial aspects. Section 2 discusses the financial stability dimension of sovereign risk \nand the related transmission channels. Section 3 discusses the existing measures being used \nto capture sovereign risk and their limitations. Section 4 looks at policy responses, and Section \n5 concludes by highlighting challenges ahead and points at some open questions and issues \nfor further examination. \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 383          Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n \n2.  MOVING TO A MACRO-FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE OF \nSOVEREIGN RISK \nA key legacy of the GFC is the realization that sovereign risk is far more than just a pure fiscal \nrisk. The analysis of sovereign risk needs to go well beyond the traditional debt sustainability \napproach to encompass the complex net of macro-financial interactions (Figure 1).  \n \nFigure 1: Debt Sustainability and Macro-Financial Perspective \n           \nCapital \nMarket \nInfrastructure\nRegulatory \nFramework\nContingent  MACRO-FINANCIAL\nLiabilities\nPERSPECTIVE\nPrimary  Interest \nExpenditure Rate\nALM  Investor \nDEBT Approach Base\nSUSTAINABILITY\nDebt  Economic \nStock Growth\nTax\nRevenue \n \n \nSource: IMF staff. \n \n2.1  Pre-crisis Debt Outlook and Medium-term Macro Projections \nThe sole focus on sovereign solvency risks in the early 2000s missed the importance of the \ndirect and contingent intertwining of cross-sectoral balance sheets with that of the sovereign. \nThis aspect has played a crucial role in a number of country cases caught in the direct \nheadwind of the GFC. At the onset of the crisis, debt sustainability in advanced economies \nwas not an issue despite their sovereign debt levels being well above 60% of GDP in a number \nof cases (Figure 2). On average, the euro area\u2019s sovereign debt hovered around 69% of \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2000\u201307.  2007  outstanding  public  debt  levels  of  Italy, \nGreece, and Belgium were projected to be 105%, 85%, and 79% of GDP, respectively.  \nIn 2007, financial markets were stable and the projected medium-term macroeconomic outlook \nof these highly-indebted economies suggested nothing but stability and solid growth. For \n    4   \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 383          Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n \ninstance, for the euro area, the World Economic Outlook (WEO) growth projections made in \n2007 for the period 2007\u201311 averaged 4.2%, and showed a path of smooth debt consolidation. \nThe 2007 housing market downturn in the Unites States (US) and the subsequent GFC, \nhowever, led to significant downward revisions of the projected debt consolidation trend and \nthe macroeconomic outlook (Figure 3). In 2011, the euro area\u2019s stock of sovereign debt surged \nby 40 percentage points relative to the 2007 levels, and nominal GDP growth rates cut back to \n1.5%. \n \n \nFigure 2: Public Debt to GDP Ratio  Figure 3: 2011 GDP Growth \n         \nProjections \n(In percent of GDP)\n180          \n(WEO  projections made in 2007 and 2011)\n6.0\n150\n2007 2011\n4.0\n120\n2.0\n90\n0.0\n60\n-2.0\n30 Projection in 2007\nProjection in 2011\n-4.0\n0\nGreece IrelandPortugal Spain Italy BelgiumFrance UK US   -6.0\n    S ourc e : IM F, Fiscal Monitor (September  Greece IrelandPortugal Spain Italy BelgiumFrance UK USA  \n2011).   So urce:  IMF, World Economic Outlook. \n \nThe shift in confidence and market expectations in future events, not purely macro fiscal \nvariables, thus played a key role in determining the public debt trajectory going forward.1 The \ncontinuous  revisions  of  some  advanced  economies\u2019  sovereign  debt  ratios  and  growth \nprojections validated the market perception that advance economy sovereigns are no longer \nrisk free. Stronger inter-linkages between sovereigns\u2019 and banks\u2019 balance sheets, combined \nwith the deterioration of fiscal and real sector outlooks, contributed to further exacerbation of \nthe perception of sovereign credit risk among advanced economies. \n2.2  From narrow Debt Sustainability to a Broader Macro-financial \nPerspective  \nOften, sovereign risk is referred to as risk to debt sustainability of a country, i.e., the probability \nthat debt ratios may cross a certain threshold.2 Under this purely macro-fiscal approach, \n                                                \n1\n See Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) for more discussion. \n2\n Aizenman et al. (2011) look at the past and current fiscal space (defined in terms of levels of debt and deficits \nrelative to tax revenues) to measure sovereign risk in a number of European countries that are currently facing \npressures. Gray et al. (2008) propose extending the notion of debt sustainability to control for the risks associated \n    5   \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 383          Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n \nsovereign risk is defined as solvency risk measured in terms of primary expenditure, stock of \nnominal debt, and tax revenue. In a debt sustainability analysis approach, which examines the \nnet present value of future debt flows, market and investor factors enter into the equation only \nthrough the discount variable. The qualitative aspects of the composition of the debt stock, \nthrough which market expectations operate, are mostly neglected. \nReliance on a fiscal approach to sovereign risk, while important, becomes too narrow to \naddress  the  macro-financial  stability  challenges  that  sovereigns  confront.  It  is  now  well \naccepted that, with the evolution and deepening of global and domestic capital markets, and \nthe entwining of the sovereign and financial sectors\u2019 balance sheets in developed markets, the \nnotion of sovereign risk has to inevitably expand to cover a much larger set of risk factors.3 To \ncite a few, the sovereign risk analysis needs to capture risks deriving from the debt structure \nand its composition, the existing capital market infrastructure, the regulatory framework, the \ncomposition of the investor base of the country (beyond the share of non-resident to resident \ndebt holders), and the funding conditions of systemically important corporations and financial \nfirms, among others.  \nInadequate policy responses in preventing and managing a sovereign credit crisis in a timely \nmanner can be explained by misperceptions about the nature of sovereign risk. The excessive \nfocus on traditional macro-fiscal risk indicators and a poor understanding of the financial \nstability and capital market implications for the sovereign balance sheet may contribute to the \nmispricing of sovereign assets pre-crisis. Weak macro-prudential and regulatory framework \nand sovereign debt management practices also lay the ground for a faster, broader, and more \namplified spread of market anxiety. \n                                                                                                                                                        \nwith sovereign assets and liabilities. Under the contingent claims approach, Gray et al. (2007) link sovereign \ncredit risk to the probability the asset value falls below the distress barrier (i.e., the present value of promised \npayments.). Garcia and Rigobon (2004) extend the debt accumulation equation to incorporate the stochastic \nfeatures of key macroeconomic variables (e.g., the real interest rate, GDP, exchange rate, and inflation) and \ndefine credit risk as the probability the debt will reach a threshold in a certain period of time.   \n3\n Cottarelli (2011a) defines rollover risks or fiscal sustainability risks as the probability that the move of certain fiscal \nindicators into dangerous territory, or other form of shocks, will trigger a negative market response. This concept \nrelies on three dimensions: (1) basic fiscal variables that are often captured under the basic fiscal solvency \nanalyses; (2) the composition of sovereign asset and liabilities and its management; (i.e., rollover needs, maturity \nstructure, and global market risks) and (3) factors affecting long-term fiscal trends. Baldacci et al. (2011) \nformulate the fiscal stress index using the notion of crises events that fall into one of four criteria: (i) sovereign \ndebt default or restructuring; (ii) IMF-program with more than a 100% quota access; (iii) very high inflation; and \n(iv) very high sovereign bond yields. \n    6   \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 383          Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n \n2.3  Defining Sovereign Risk \nDespite its popular use since 2009, there is little consensus on how best to define sovereign \nrisk. We propose expanding the concepts advanced in the macro-fiscal and macro-prudential \nliterature to incorporate the macro-financial risks that sovereigns encounter. Sovereign risk is a \ncomplex combination of risks that feed through a number of channels into the sovereign \nbalance sheet in a non-monotonic fashion (Figure 4). For instance, credit risk from systemic \nfinancial institutions will channel through the contingent liabilities component of the sovereign \nbalance sheet, whereas market risk will affect the fiscal revenue and international reserves \ncomponents. \n  \nFigure 4: Defining Sovereign Risk \n \nSource : IMF staff. \n    7   \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 383          Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n \nUsing a balance sheet approach, sovereign risk can be defined as the probability of a \nsignificant deterioration of the sovereign\u2019s balance sheet, either via increased vulnerabilities in \nthe domestic market (financial sector, sovereign credit market, real sector, the external sector), \nand/or vulnerabilities in foreign markets that spillover to the country. More formally: \n \nSovereign risk = Probability (event) \u2265 Threshold \n\u2261 Prob ( A < AThreshold \u222a L > LThreshold \u222a K < KThreshold ) \u222a Threshold  (1) \nwhere A stands for assets, L for liabilities, and K for net debt or net worth of the country. \nThe deterioration of the balance sheet could be explained by a weakening of the asset side \nand/or a surge of the sovereign liabilities of the country. It could be driven by a factor(s) that \nincrease(s) the value of the sovereign liabilities of the country and/or reduces the value of \nsovereign assets, and that, as a result, cause(s) the balance sheet to worsen. The dynamics of \nthe  asset  side  will  vary  significantly,  country  by  country,  and  depend  on  particular \ncircumstances. For instance, in the case of fixed assets, the value and liquidity of public real \nestate properties may significantly worsen during periods of stress. Also, assets from oil-rich \neconomies will be significantly affected by changes in the oil and related commodity markets. \nFurther,  the  notion  of  being  \u201csignificant\u201d  can  be  seen  as  country-specific.  For  instance, \neconomies with a history of default may suffer from higher risk aversion (Eichengreen and \nHausmann 1999) and therefore their \u201csignificant\u201d may mean less than for countries with no \ndefault history. A conceptualization of \u201csignificant\u201d would require testing the complex net of risk \nindicators (e.g., liquidity and solvency ratios) against some pre-determined threshold values.  \n2.4  Sovereign Risk as a Composite of Risks: Conceptual Framework \nSovereign risk is a complex blend of risk factors that spread into the sovereign balance sheet \nin a non-monotonic fashion through a variety of channels. Sovereign risk encompasses (i) \ndomestic sovereign risk emanating directly from the sovereign balance sheet, (ii) domestic \nnegative feedback risk originating from the impact of systemic institutions on the sovereign \nbalance sheet and, (iii) cross-border risks spilling over from foreign economies countries to the \nsovereign balance sheet. Formally, equation (1) can be re-written as the combination of risks \nat play as a result of the expansion of linkages across sectors and countries (see Figure 1): \nSovereign risk \u2261 F ( riski,d, sov, riski, d, SI, riski, foreign )  (2) \nwith the impact of event i (i = solvency, liquidity, market, and operational) fueling through the \nsovereign  (sov)  balance  sheet  of  the  domestic  market  d.

AMPLIFICATION AND MANIFESTATION OF SOVEREIGN \nAND FINANCIAL STABILITY RISK \nThe broader notion of sovereign risk presented above has surfaced in different forms during \nthe crisis. It is, however, most evident in the context of financial stability, with the tightening of \nthe sovereign and banking sector balance sheets and the larger exposures to external shocks \nthrough  financial  channels.  The  dynamics  of  global  investment,  through  changes  in  the \ninvestor base and capital flows\u2019 composition, illustrates the transmission of sovereign risk from \none country to another and its global implications.  \n3.1  Sovereign-Bank Inter-linkages: Concepts and Channels \nSovereign credit risk can fuel through both sides of banks\u2019 balance sheet (e.g., through the \nloan portfolio and financing), resulting in negative feedback loop (Figure 5). It is transferred \nthrough various channels (Merler and Pisani-Ferry 2012) including (i) mark-to-market losses \non sovereign bond holdings; and (ii) an increase in bank funding costs caused by the re-pricing \nof risk, including credit rating downgrades and higher haircuts in liquidity assistance from the \ncentral bank. Moreover, bank funding pressures could lead to government guarantees on bank \nsecurities to be called, thus increasing the sovereign debt burden. In the GFC, direct support \nfrom  the  sovereign to the financial  sector  in  a  selected  number  of  advanced  economies \naveraged about 6.8% of GDP, but the range is ample. In the case of Ireland, for example, the \nIrish government support to the domestic banking sector reached 41% of GDP (IMF 2011b). \nFigure 5: Sovereign-Banking Sector Linkage \n       \nMark-to-market risk\nBank funding cost\nBANKING\nSOVEREIGN\nSYSTEM\nA\nGovernment A\ncontingent\nliabilities\nCounterparty\nSimilar credit\nRating  Rating \nsovereigns risk\nagencies, agencies,\nunder Mark-to-market risk\nInvestor  pressure Investor \nbase, base,\netc \u2026 etc \u2026\nMark-to-market risk\nBank funding cost\nBANKING\nSOVEREIGN\nSYSTEM\nB\nB\n \n \nSource: IMF Staff. \n    10   \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 383          Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n \nThe strengthening of linkages between the sovereign and domestic banks\u2019 balance sheets \nfurther increased the two-way shocks\u2019 transmission channel. As such, two-way spillover effects \nmay reinforce each other, potentially to a point in which implicit government guarantees to the \nbanking sector lead to value losses. The tightening of sovereign-banks\u2019 balance sheet inter-\nlinkages  suggests  the  need  for  a  joint  assessment  of  banking  and  sovereign  sectors\u2019 \nvulnerabilities. In the past years, sovereign credit default swaps (CDSs) and bank CDSs in the \nEuropean region showed high correlation, reflecting the market participants\u2019 perceptions on the \nnegative feedback linkages (Figure 6). \nFigure 6: European Sovereign and Financial CDS Spreads \n             \n(In bps)\n450 1.2\n400\n1.0\n350\n300 0.8\n250\n0.6\n200\n150 0.4\n100 Sovereigns (LHS)\n0.2\nFinancials, senior debt (LHS)\n50\nCorrelations (6 month, RHS)\n0 0.0\n \nSources: Bloombe rg a nd  IMF  staff calculations. \n \nA strong nexus between the sovereign and domestic financial institutions can lead to financial \nrisk concentration in the medium- and long-term. In the short run, both banks and sovereigns \nshare common interests: banks\u2019 holdings of large amounts of government bonds assures \nstable financing for sovereigns, while banks improve their solvency ratios by accumulating low-\nrisk weighted government bonds. However, excessive links between the two balance sheets \nmay exacerbate future spillovers and increase their vulnerabilities.  \nOn the international channel, the loss of confidence in a sovereign market can cause knock-on \neffects  on  other  distressed  sovereigns  (Claessens  and  Forbes  2001).  These  well-known \ncontagion effects across highly-indebted economies evidenced once more during the GFC. In \nEurope, the sovereign spillover risk (measured in \u201cspillover coefficients\u201d, which is a sum of \nprobabilities  of  debt  distress  of  a  sovereign,  conditional  on  other  sovereigns  becoming \ndistressed,  see  Figure 7)  not  only  increased during the  crisis for  each  of the  vulnerable \neconomies  but  also  showed  signs  of  clustering,  reflecting  the  highly-integrated  regional \n    11   \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 383          Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n \nfinancial system.

In crisis episodes, global \ninvestors\u2019 willingness to participate in sovereign debt auctions tends to get impaired, raising \nthe risk of auctions failures. To date, there have been very few episodes of failing auctions \nduring the GFC despite high refinancing needs for banks and sovereigns. However, weak \nsovereign and bank balance sheets could still suffer from heightened refinancing risk through \nexcesses in absorption capacity (Figure 8). \n    12   \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 383          Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n \nFigure 8: Euro area Sovereign Refinancing Risk \n \n Source: Bloomberg. \n \n3.2  Investors\u2019 Perspective: Investor Base and Capital Flows \nThe composition of the investor base is a key variable in the analysis of sovereign risk and \nfinancial stability.

Further, Arslanalp and Tsuda (2012) argue that the composition of the \nsovereign investor base can have key policy implications on government refinancing risks \n(through a high participation of foreign investors) and domestic financial stability (through the \nincreasing importance of domestic banks). The composition of the investor base can be also \nexamined in terms of the diversity of the investor; a more diversified investor base can foster \nsecondary market liquidity, while a disperse investor base could complicate investor relations, \nand in the extreme, post a significant challenge in debt restructuring negotiations (e.g., Greek \nprivate-sector involvement [PSI] negotiation).5 \n                                                \n5\n See Das et al.

Indeed, the investor \nbase of a country mirrors the demand side of the sovereign debt dynamics and can play a \nmajor role in the loss of market access.6 In particular, investors\u2019 balance sheets mirror the \nstability  levels  of  market  demand,  since  highly-leveraged  investors  tend  to  liquidate  their \npositions  faster  than  those  with  lower  leverage.

Beyond the euro area, Arslanalp and Tsuda (2012) examine the global trend of the \nmajor advanced economies\u2019 investor base and identify the rising proportion of foreign investor \nbase as risks in the future.  \nFigure 9: Changes in the Sovereign Investor Base \n \nSources: Bank for International Settlements; Quarterly External Debt Statistics database; and IMF staff estimates. \nNote: Program countries include Greece, Ireland, and Portugal. \n \nInvestors have become more selective in their sovereign credit risk assessments. Prior to the \nGFC, most investors tended to assume that advanced economies\u2019 sovereigns were risk-free. \nThe debt crisis has, once again, crystallized the wide spectrum of credit risks among various \nsovereigns. The novelty this time around is that financial markets are much more developed \nand integrated. The compounded set of risks and their magnification are forcing investors to be \nmore  risk-sensitive.  International  banks  are  now  shifting  their  assets  from  once  risk-free \nsovereigns to safer destinations, in particular, those with reserve currency status (Figure 10). \n                                                \n6\n Gelos et al.

MEASURING SOVEREIGN RISK  \nVarious measures of sovereign risk are currently in use. Such measures include default risk \nextracted from CDS and bond spreads, financial sector indicator, global risk indicator, and \nfiscal indicator. None of them captures the complex nature of sovereign risk by themselves, \nthus suggesting the need for a more holistic measure.  \nMeasuring sovereign risk implies attaching a scalar value to a tail event altering the sovereign \nbalance  sheet.  As  such,  it  implies  attaching  a  value  to  the  probability  of  observing  an \nundesirable development affecting the sovereign balance sheet. This probability is determined \nby a number of observable and unobservable factors. The mis-measurement of risks and of \ntheir pricing before the GFC is often seen as having altered agents\u2019 risk taking and become a \nsource of financial fragility.  \nThere is no consensus among practitioners and economists on how best to measure sovereign \nrisk from a sovereign balance sheet angle. The bulk of the literature on sovereign risk has \nexplicitly focused on a subset of risks affecting the stability of the economy or a number of \nsectors, prominently the banking sector. We examine several empirical methodologies applied \nby practitioners.  \nMarket  perception  extracted  from  CDS  or  bond  spreads.  CDS  or  bond  spreads  to \nbenchmarks  are  often used  as  an  indicator  of  the market's  perception  of  sovereign risk. \nChanges in the market-implied default probabilities extracted from 5-year CDS premia on \nsovereign debt are often cited as indication of changes in sovereign risk. Another standard \n    16   \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 383          Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n \nmeasure used by practitioners to track sovereign risk is spreads of sovereign bond prices to \nrisk-free bond prices (bunds in the European Union (EU) market, US bonds in the Latin \nAmerican context, or swaps more in general), Drawbacks of the CDS methodology, however, \nrelate to its sensitivity to liquidity conditions in the CDS market itself and uncertainty in the \ntriggering of CDS credit events. \nFinancial sector soundness indicator. The IMF\u2019s Financial Sector Assessment Program \n(FSAP) looks at the effects of some components of sovereign risk on the financial sector. \nRecent  FSAPs  have  sharpened  their  focus  to  incorporate  the  impact  of  sovereign  debt \nholdings on the banking sector\u2019s balance sheet. The risk assessment relies on stressing the \ncost  of  holding  sovereign  instruments  in  the  different  bank  accounts  and  assessing  the \nsensitivity of banks\u2019 positions when imposing more stringent sovereign spread assumptions. \nThe tests assume a concentration of exposures to sovereign debt under assumptions that risks \nspill over through other asset prices, asset volatility and the real sector of the economy. \nHowever, they do not cover the feedback effect of risk originating from banks\u2019 balance sheets \non the sovereign balance sheet.9, 10 \nGlobal  financial  stability  indicator. The IMF\u2019s Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR) \nassesses risks facing the economy (macro, credit, funding liquidity, and leverage, among other \ntype of risks) and their impact on global financial stability; sovereign risk is a sub-component. \nThe \u201csix ray map indicator\u201d builds on four sets of risk indicators (macroeconomic, emerging \nmarkets, credit, and market) and two sets of conditions (monetary and financial, investors\u2019 risk \nappetite),  each  of  which  is  a  constructed  index  summarizing  a  number  of  variables  and \nindicators identified in the literature. \nFiscal indicator. The fiscal vulnerability and stress indexes measure fiscal sustainability risks \nby looking at government roll over risks (Baldacci et al. (2011a, b)). The simple average of \nboth indexes is used as a risk score measure to rank fiscal sustainability risks under baseline \npolicy scenarios. The fiscal vulnerability index tries to identify abnormal increases in rollover \nrisks compared to the same country\u2019s medium-term trends and cross-country averages. The \nfiscal stress index tries to measure the probability of a tail event resulting from hikes in fiscal \nvariables risks (e.g., adjusted primary balance, population aging, or expenditure pressures) \nand asset and liability management risks (e.g., risks resulting from the currency and non-\nresident investor base composition of the stock of debt.)  \n                                                \n9\n The FSAP work is based on extreme but plausible scenarios guided by past history of the country, including on \ndefault episodes. They produce economic assessments on the vulnerabilities of the economy that may differ from \nthose resulting from a regulatory approach. The treatment of issues such as bank capital, liquidity and maturity \nrisks based on the country\u2019s regulatory framework may differ from that resulting from economic analysis. \n10\n In a similar vein, over the years the Bank of England has developed an analytical risk assessment approach to \nfinancial stability. Their approach also builds on a number of identified vulnerabilities to the UK\u2019s financial sector, \nincluding those propagating through the public sector. The focus, however, is the banking sector (Bank of \nEngland 2007). \n    17   \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 383          Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n \nOur brief summary of currently-existing risk metrics reveals the absence of a standardized \nindicator of sovereign risk. Some indicators discussed above include elements of sovereign \nrisk (as defined in Section 2), but either fail to capture its complex nature or mix it with other \nglobal risks (going beyond sovereign risk). Going forward, there is demand for a \u201cmapping\u201d \napproach,  that  permits  analyzing  risk  indicators  (that  explain  sovereign  risk)  in  a \ncomprehensive manner.  \n5.  THE POLICY RESPONSE  \nAs the concept of sovereign risk progressively drifts away from narrow debt sustainability \nanalysis  to  a  more  complex  network  of  macro-financial  interactions,  so  should  too  the \nappropriate policy response. With the debt profile depending on a broad range of financial \nvariables (including the structure and composition of the debt, the evolving nature of the \ninvestor base and cross-border spillover effects), a debt trajectory target also needs to be \ndesigned  controlling  for  financial  market  factors.  Policies  exclusively  focused  on  fiscal \naggregates risk exacerbates the adverse loop between investor confidence and demand for \nfinancial assets, and may ultimately dampen economic activity. \nThe GFC highlights the need for revisiting the approach to sovereign risk management, both at \nnormal and crisis prevention phases. Sovereign risk management in normal times calls for \nmanaging the stock of debt in a way that provides insurance against a broad range of shocks, \nfor instance, by achieving low rollover profiles and building up sufficiently large cash buffers. \nAlso, crisis prevention calls for internalizing exposures on contingent liabilities and potential \nfeedback effects, and for structuring the stock of debt as to isolate it against negative shocks.  \nGiven high integration of financial markets, only a comprehensive and coherent policy menu \nencompassing the sovereign-financial sector-foreign spillovers\u2019 linkages can tilt the balance \nback towards a good equilibrium. Restoring a good equilibrium encompasses a \u201ccrisis\u201d policy \nmix with a solid back stopping facility that covers all members of the union, credible financing \ninstruments to achieve burden sharing, a clear role of the central bank in the crisis resolution \nframework, and an early commitment to correcting existing frictions in the market structure. \n5.1  The Multiple Equilibrium Risk: Tilting the Balance to the Good \nEquilibrium \nDriven by weak balance sheets and affected heavily by expectations, debt capital markets can \nbe prone to multiple equilibria. The bad equilibrium is usually triggered by market perception \nthat sovereigns are vulnerable. A loss of investor confidence leads to higher market volatility, \nerosion of demand for financial assets, and an unstable investor base. As a result, funding \ncosts  surge. If taking  systemic  dimensions, these  pervasive  dynamics  will  install  into  the \n    18   \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 383          Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n \ncountry\u2019s  real  sector  economic  activity  and  feed  backwards  into  further  loss  of  market \nconfidence (Figure 12).11 A vicious circle channeled through financial markets sets in and is \ndifficult to break. \nFigure 12: Illustration of Multiple Equilibria \n \nSources: IMF, Global Financial Stability Report, September 2011. \n \nDuring  bad times, financial  market  integration helps  catalyze  and  morph risks faster  and \ndeeper into the economic structures. Similar adverse dynamics may develop in other non-\nEuropean advanced markets or emerging markets. Benefiting from a perception of relatively \nsafe assets, emerging markets have so far been isolated from pressures. However, spill-over \nchannels makes them vulnerable to financing stress through potential sharp outflows of capital \nor changes in investor demand. In any of these cases, only adequate policy response can tilt \nthe balance towards the good equilibrium. \n5.2  Managing Risk through a Crisis\u2014Crisis Prevention \nThe broader concept of sovereign risk that has come with the crisis highlights the need to \nrevisit the risk management approach (Figures 13 and 14 and Principle 8 in Annex). Important \ninteractions between macroeconomic vulnerabilities and sovereign debt structures have been \nmissed  under  the  traditional  cost-risk  debt  management  analysis.  Once  sovereign  stress \nsurfaces, there are three broad sovereign risk management approaches to tilting the balance \n                                                \n11\n The good equilibrium is not immune to future negative debt dynamics. For instance, a lower interest rate may \ninduce private sector investors to pursue higher leverage again, as observed in the Great Moderation. \n    19   \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 383          Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n \nto a good equilibrium (see next sub-section): (i) changing the issuance mix; (ii) adapting \nfinancing  modalities;  and  (iii)  stepping  up  market  management  operations.  Typically,  the \ndesign of the preferred maturity structure of the debt is informed using cost-risk tradeoffs and \nhistorical outcomes. A forward-looking approach focusing on existing exposures and a full \nrange  of  risk  factors  (including  in  the  macro-financial  area)  would  have  been  needed  to \nrespond to an event as extreme as the current crisis. \n  \nFigure 13: Modeling Sovereign Risk \n \nSource: IMF staff. \nFigure 14: Assessment of Sovereign Risk and Sensitivity Concerns \n                \nCOMPLETEASSESSMENTOFSOVEREIGN\nMARKETSENSITIVITYCONCERNS\nRISK\n \n \nSource: IMF staff. \n    20   \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 383          Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n \n \nIn preventing risk build-up, nontraditional risk exposures also need to be adequately captured \n(see Principle 1 in Annex). Most cost-risk analyses do not consider financing shocks that may \nmaterialize  via  the  activation  of  implicit  financial  sector  contingent  liabilities,  large  quasi-\nsovereign or sub-national debt. Moreover, models do not contemplate shocks that may arise \nfrom a sudden withdrawal of investment. Excessive reliance on foreign investors, typically \nmore sensitive to negative shocks, may aggravate financing risk even further. Nonresidents \ntend to be more sensitive and reactive to events that undermine the quality of the sovereign \nbalance sheet and to downgrades in credit quality. \nThere may be scope to strengthen the resilience of the investor base through changes in the \ndebt  structure.  To  better  understand  the  market  dynamics,  debt  managers  need  to  be \ncognizant of the underlying motivation of the transactions. For instance, certain classes of \ninvestors  may  prefer  specific  instruments  or  issuance  volumes  due  to  their  risk-return \npreferences, transaction size limits, or regulatory constrains. Traditionally, greater issuance of \ninflation-linked debt or longer-dated debt appeals to institutional investors, such as pension \nfunds and life insurance companies, but may not meet needs of banks that prefer shorter \nduration  in  general.  Reducing  the  concentration  of  investor  type  would  not  only  reduce \nexposure to rollover risk but could also enhance market liquidity and, thus, contribute to the \nbroader policy goal of enhancing financial stability. Increasing the participation of the domestic \ninvestors might provide greater resilience to a sudden stop in market access, although this \ncould  increase  the  risk  associated  with  a  greater  degree  of  interconnection  between  the \ndomestic financial sector and the sovereign. \nThe current crisis has highlighted the importance of favorable public debt portfolio structures in \nproviding insurance against a range of shocks (see again Principle 1 in Annex). Since the debt \ncrises  of  the  1990s,  many  emerging  market  economies  put  considerable  emphasis  on \nmitigating rollover risk and external vulnerabilities.12 This has contributed to their resilience in \nthis crisis. For example, maintaining a low rollover profile helps: (i) reduce the risk that an \ninvestor strike will drive up yields; (ii) provide resilience where the exchange rate regime \nconstrains policy choices; (iii) reduce the cost of servicing the debt as a consequence of any \ndeterioration in creditworthiness; and (iv) make it easier to absorb the financing impact of \nreduced tax receipts and an accommodative fiscal policy. \nThe appropriate scale of liquidity buffers could also be usefully recalibrated. Liquidity buffers, \nby providing access to resources to meet redemptions, can play a similar role in reducing \nrollover risk. Some countries actively pre-fund their debt (or equivalently, buyback shorter-\ndated  maturities)  as  part  of  their  ongoing  standard  operations  (e.g.,  Belgium  and  the \nNetherlands). Whether and  how  large  a  liquidity  buffer  should  be  established  is  a  policy \n                                                \n12\n See Anderson, Silva, and Velandia-Rubiano (2010). \n    21   \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 383          Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n \ndecision to be coordinated across a range of stakeholders. Large buffers may raise new \nchallenges for both government cash management and central bank liquidity management.  \n5.3  Managing Risk through a Crisis\u2014Debt Management Policy \nThe linkage between public debt management and financial stability is highlighted following the \nGFC (Das, Papaioannou, Pedras, Ahmed, and Surti 2010). Apart from the adoption of specific \nstrategies that may vary substantially from country to country, there are three broad debt \nmanagement  measures  to  manage  sovereign  risk  during  sovereign  stress  outbursts:  (i) \nchanging the debt issuance mix; (ii) adapting financing modalities; and (iii) stepping up market \nmanagement  operations.13  De  Broeck  and  Guscina  (2011)  discuss  various  crisis-related \nchanges in government debt issuance in European countries.  \nCountries may need to expand their use of non-core markets and borrowing instruments. For \nexample, in an effort to flexibly respond to market demand, both Belgium and the Netherlands \nintroduced  a  medium-term  note  (MTN)  program  and  issued  additional  short-term  debt \nsecurities, thus promoting investor diversification. Germany used the benefits of maintaining a \npresence in foreign markets in better times to issue new debt instruments; and in September \n2009  it  issued  its  second  ever  foreign  currency  denominated  bond.  Furthermore, \nsupplementary issuance plans that complement core programs also helped raise additional \nfinancing at the margin.14 In several countries (e.g., the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, and \nGermany), smaller issues of off-the-run bonds became a more frequent and significant part of \nthe financing program during the crisis. \nFinancial fragility may call for operational frameworks to adapt to new conditions both in the \nprimary and the secondary markets. As sovereign risk spurs, issuance mechanisms may need \nto be modified to support the primary market. With vulnerable primary dealer balance sheets, \nmechanisms that facilitate a larger participation of investors in primary issues may be needed. \nIn some cases, syndication may be a valid option. In other cases, the format of auctions may \nbe modified to make it more attractive for investors to participate. Although transparency and \npredictability remain at the core of risk management practices, there are gains to increasing \nflexibility in periods of tension. Greater flexibility may require extending the size and choice of \ndebt instruments to be issued through auctions, and adapting auction programs to changing \nmarket conditions.  \nPrimary dealer frameworks also need to remain flexible to market stress. Vulnerabilities in the \nbanking sector impair dealers\u2019 ability to take large positions, leading to a significant decline in \nsecondary  market  liquidity.  Responding  to  challenging  liquidity  conditions,  countries  may \n                                                \n13\n IMF 2011c for further discussion. \n14\n See Das, Papaioannou, and Trebesch (2010) for the effects of sovereign default risk and private sector access to \ncapital in emerging markets. \n    22   \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 383          Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n \nchoose to relax or adapt market making obligations and to consider changes as permanent. \nThe debt managers\u2019 toolkit to enhance market liquidity may also include liability management \noperations,  such  as  debt  exchanges  and  purchases  or  sales  of  off-the-runs.  Their \nimplementation will hinge on market circumstances and vary market to market. Often liability \nmanagement operations are initiated at the request of dealers.  \n6.  CONCLUSIONS\u2014CHALLENGES AHEAD AND OPEN \nQUESTIONS \nWe have yet to fully comprehend the interplay of factors driving sovereign risk. The nature of \nsovereign risk has been transformed in a number of ways since the beginning of the GFC four \nyears ago. Under the conventional view, high levels of debt and fiscal vulnerabilities play key \nroles in market assessments of sovereign risk. Recent events, however, have exposed the \nrelevance of contingent liabilities and the inter-linkages between sovereigns and banks. \nFurthermore, the GFC has evidenced the lack of appropriate tools to measure and manage \nsovereign risk. There is a need for new tools to monitor sovereign risk as a complex set of \nrisks. The complexity and entwining of sovereign, corporate and households\u2019 balance sheets \ncalls for a more holistic approach to risk analysis and stress testing work that places more \nfocus on the inter-linkages and feedback loops embedded in sovereign risk.  \nA sovereign risk management office (Das and Lindner 2012) could be set up to oversee and \nassess sovereign risk and vulnerabilities in the economy, and advise the country on remedial \nmeasures. The recommendations issued by this independent institution would inform and feed \ninto the policy mix design of the country authorities. \nThe overhauling and strengthening of the global financial system encompassed the adoption of \nseveral new regulations that could further increase the demand for sovereign debt. Basel III \ncovers two liquidity standards\u2014a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and a net stable financing ratio \n(NSFR) to be introduced after an observation period. For the most part, the additional financing \nneeded by banks to meet the LCR ratio requires more purchases of sovereign debt.15 Also, \nnew regulations on capital and risk weighted assets could also incentivize banks to shift \ndemand towards safer assets that carry a lower risk weight, increasing demand for sovereign \n                                                \n15\n Banks may be induced to sell longer-term government bonds to meet the desired NSFR. To this extent, there \nmay be certain sell pressure for the government bonds. \n    23   \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 383          Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n \ndebt  further.  The  larger  demand  for  safe  assets  might  also  respond  to  changes  in  the \nregulatory framework for the non-bank financial sector.16 \nThe new regulations may increase liquidity risks on the secondary and repo markets. The \nregulation-induced demand for sovereign debt, in particular the LCR, risks reducing liquidity in \ndebt markets by requiring banks to hold relatively more government debt securities on their \nown balance sheets, and consequently reduce the proportion available for sale. This might \nthen reduce trading in the secondary markets, which would also impede price discovery and \ndistort market signals. Jurisdictions in which the stock of debt is not sufficient to cover the \nincreased demand from banks to meet the LCR could be the most affected ones. Other \ncountries with a low stock of sovereign debt may face similar challenges if the new standards \nbecome part of the Basel core principles and are adopted more widely. Furthermore, the \nadoption of outright leverage ratios that include repos as part of leverage, despite their safety, \ncould make this lending practice too costly.17 \nFinally, the issuance and distribution models of public debt could be at risk. The heightened \nsovereign risks in some government bond markets may constrain primary dealers\u2019 ability to \nwarehouse sovereign debt securities. Large financial institutions are reassessing the business \nmodel in dealing with volatile sovereign debt assets, resulting in large yield concessions ahead \nof government bond auctions and poor distribution of bids. Alternative debt management \ntechniques may need to be explored. \n                                                \n16\n For instance, new regulations on money market funds in the US or on insurance companies in Europe. Other \nsources of safe assets\u2019 demand could result from lower reliance on credit rating agencies, greater use of central \ncounterparties for both repurchase agreements and derivative transactions as collateral. \n17\n Collateralized lending in the form of repos is credit risk-free beyond the exposure to the sovereign. However, \nregulations on trading and leverage that dis-incentivize repo activity may further reduce liquidity in debt markets. \nIn the absence of a well-functioning repo market, government bond markets might become broker markets where \nmarket makers neither trade on their own books nor provide continuous pricing. \n    24   \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 383          Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n \nREFERENCES \nAizenman, J., M.

The scope of debt management should be defined in a way that also accounts for any \nrelevant interactions between the nature of financial assets, explicit and implicit contingent \nliabilities, and the structure of the debt portfolio. \nThe crisis-related interventions have involved a wide range of debt management operations. In \nsome instances, changes have taken place in the structure and the composition of the debt \nportfolio. It is important that the debt management strategy takes into account the relevant \nvariables and the policy and financial risk implications. \n2. Strategic and operational debt management decisions should be supported by relevant \ninformation sharing at the domestic, regional, and global levels. \nThe crisis has raised the risk of financial stability spillovers, including systemic cross-border \ncontagion. Therefore, the need for information sharing on materially important aspects, at both \nthe regional and global levels, takes on greater significance. This aspect becomes especially \nimportant  when  the  investor  base  comprises  both  domestic  and  foreign  participants. \nInformation  sharing  should  take  place  among  relevant  public  authorities,  and  where \nappropriate, also with the private sector. \n3. Flexibility in market operations should be maintained to minimize execution risk, improve \nprice discovery, relieve market dislocations, and support secondary market liquidity. \nIn light of the challenges of issuing and managing increased amounts of debt, debt managers \nshould retain sufficient flexibility to adapt the debt issuance format and/or adopt different \nissuance techniques. They should also be prepared to make timely use of liability management \noperations to alleviate secondary market impairments. In such cases, the following Principle 5 \nshould also be taken into consideration. \n                                                \n18\n These principles emerged from discussions at the 10th Annual IMF consultations on \u201cPolicy and Operational \nIssues facing Public Debt Management,\u201d co-hosted by the Swedish National Debt Office in Stockholm, June \n2010. \n    27   \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 383          Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n \nCommunication \n4. Proactive and timely market communication strategies should be maintained to support \na transparent and predictable operational framework for debt management. \nEffective communication helps minimize uncertainty and contain costs by providing investors \nwith  the  necessary  information  required  to  form  expectations  and  manage  investment \ndecisions.  This  also  facilitates  the  smooth  undertaking  of  debt  management  operations, \nincluding primary market issuance. \n5. Modifications to the operational toolkits of debt managers should be properly explained. \nAs changes are made, debt managers should communicate them to the public clearly and in a \ntimely fashion. Where appropriate, prior consultation with investors and other stakeholders \nshould be undertaken to garner feedback and support for the planned changes, such as the \nintroduction  of  a  new  debt  instrument  or  an  adjustment  to  an  existing  debt  issuance \nmechanism. \n6. Communication among debt managers and monetary, fiscal, and financial regulatory \nauthorities should be promoted, given greater inter-linkages across objectives, yet with each \nagency maintaining independence and accountability for its respective role. \nThe  higher  levels  of  debt  and  increased  uncertainties  regarding  fiscal,  monetary,  and \nregulatory policies imply the need for close communication among different agencies on all \nrelevant  aspects.  However,  it  is  important that  these  agencies  retain their functional  and \noperational independence in areas for which they are accountable. \n7. A close and continuing dialogue with the investor base should be promoted to keep \nabreast of its characteristics and preferences. \nUnderstanding the nature of the investor base and shifts in the investment philosophy enables \ndebt  managers  to  identify  potential  vulnerabilities  and  new  opportunities,  and  to  offer \ninstruments that better match investors\u2019 needs. This can have important positive effects in \nlimiting  funding  disruptions,  mitigating  adverse  funding  conditions,  and  reassuring  that \ninvestors are being treated equitably. \nRisk management  \n8. Debt portfolio risks should be kept at prudent levels, while funding costs are minimized \nover the medium- to long-term. \nGiven the increased exposure to macroeconomic and financial risks, a stronger emphasis \nshould be placed on risk mitigation than that implied by traditional policy objectives of public \ndebt management. The debt manager should have a framework that helps identify, assess, \nand monitor the risks associated with debt management operations. \n    28   \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 383          Das, Oliva, and Tsuda \n \n9.  When  determining  medium-term  debt  management  strategies,  the  range  of  risk \nfactors considered should be consistent with the broadest definition of the debt portfolio and \nthe associated range of potential scenarios. \nThe main sources of the risks to which the sovereign balance sheet is exposed should be \nidentified and a clear framework on how these risks are managed should be established. A \ncareful analysis of the debt portfolio should be carried out on the basis of relevant economic \nand financial stress scenarios, including the costs and risks of alternative strategies. \n10.  Prudent  risk  management  strategies  covering  the  full  range  of  risks  facing \nsovereign debt managers should be adopted and communicated to investors. \nIn many cases, the high level of debt is constraining governments\u2019 ability to absorb additional \nrisk  on  their  balance  sheets.  It  is  important  to  maintain  debt  portfolios  that  reduce  the \nsovereign exposure to a variety of financial risks, including refinancing risk and exposure to \ncontingent liabilities. Debt managers should clearly set out the strategies being adopted to limit \nthese risks and communicate them to the public. \n    29   \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "Udaibir S. Das, Maria A.
