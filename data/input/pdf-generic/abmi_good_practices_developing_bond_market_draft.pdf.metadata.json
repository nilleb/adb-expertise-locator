Thailand  was  first  hit,  followed  by \nIndonesia and the Republic of Korea. The root cause, which created risks and eventually led to \nthe  crisis,  was  the  so-called  \u201cdouble  mismatch  problem.\u201d  That  is,  businesses  borrowed  short-\nterm bank loans in a foreign currency to finance long-term investments that generated returns in \na  domestic  currency.  This  problem  is  structural  and  differs  from  a  more  traditional  debt  crisis \ncaused  by  over-borrowing,  such  as  those  in  Latin  America  in  the  early  1980s.  Experts  inside \nand outside the region identified the need to develop domestic bond market to address the root \ncause of the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis. This paper will not focus on examining the behavior \nof  businesses  and  financial  institutions  in  creating  the  double  mismatch  problem.  Instead,  it \nfocuses  on  how  countries  in  Asia  addressed  the  problem  by  developing  their  domestic  bond \nmarkets. \n\nThe  crisis  severely  impacted  the  banking  and  financial  systems  of  three  countries,  with \nrepercussions that spread well beyond. The severity of impact differed from country to country, \nwhich led to different reform agendas in response. Yet, one thing in common across the region \nwas  that  governments  supported  the  stability  of  the  banking  and  financial  systems  by \nrecapitalizing distressed banks and financing the losses of finance companies. To do so, some \ngovernments  in  the region  issued  massive  amounts  of government  bonds,  which  jump-started \nthe development of the bond market in these countries. Thus, the crisis not only called for the \ndevelopment  of  local  currency  (LCY)  bond  markets  in  the  long  run,  but  also  necessitated  it  in \nthe short run. \n\nThe  crisis-hit  countries  sought  to  build  up  their  bond  markets  by  bringing  together  a  range  of \nstakeholders in the effort. Finance ministries and central banks took on a strong leadership role \nin  guiding  the  development  of  bond  markets.  In  2002,  the  10  members  of  the  Association  of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Japan, and the \nRepublic of Korea\u2014known collectively as ASEAN+3\u2014jointly launched the Asian Bond Markets \nInitiative (ABMI) to pursue the region-wide promotion of LCY bond markets to address the root \ncause of the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis. \n\n                                                            \n1 The paper was prepared by experts of ASEAN+3, Noritaka Akamatsu, Senior Advisor, and Kosintr Puongsophol, \nFinancial Sector Specialist, Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department (SDCC), Asian Development \nBank (ADB). Research assistance was provided by Yvonne Osonia, consultant, SDCC, ADB. The views and opinions \nexpressed here do not necessarily reflect those of ASEAN+3 and ADB. \n\n \n\n1 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nSince  then,  the  five  original  members  of  ASEAN  plus  the  PRC,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  and \nViet Nam  have  achieved  remarkable  progress  in  developing  their  respective  domestic  bond \nmarkets.2 Total  market  capitalization  in  the  region  has  surpassed  $10  trillion  and  comprises \nmore than 60% of the underlying gross domestic product (GDP) of the eight economies, which \nis  18  times  larger  than  the  pre-crisis  level.  Indonesia  and  Thailand  made  concerted  efforts  to \ndevelop  their  markets,  including  strong  public  debt  management  capacity.  The  Republic  of \nKorea  and  Malaysia  developed  bond  markets that  are  well  balanced  between  the  government \nand  corporate  segments  with  significant  depth  in  both,  while  the  PRC  built-up  the  region\u2019s \ndominant  bond  market  in  terms  of  size.  Many  governments  in  the  region  have  put  in  place \nsound market infrastructure in line with the level of development of their bond markets.   \n\nHowever,  bond  market  development  has  been  uneven  across  ASEAN+3.    Brunei,  Cambodia, \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and Myanmar have only recently begun (or \nwill soon need to begin) to tackle the challenges of starting a government bond market. In many \ncountries, there is a need to further develop the corporate bond market particularly in the face of \nthe increasingly tighter prudential framework for the banking system.   \n\nThis study seeks to share good practices among selected members of ASEAN+3 in developing \nLCY  bond  markets,  particularly  government  bond  markets.  It  is  meant  to  provide  models  and \nreferences for BCLM in tackling the challenges associated with bond market development. It is \nalso  meant to  share  the  experiences  of  ASEAN+3  with  the  rest  of the  Asia-Pacific community \nand the wider world. Within the Asia-Pacific region, there are a number of countries that could \nbenefit  from  the  experiences  of  ASEAN+3.  These  lessons  learned  can  also  promote  South\u2013\nSouth  cooperation  between  the  Asia-Pacific  and  other  regions  such  as  Africa,  the  Caribbean, \nand Latin America. Finally, this paper will also contribute to an initiative of the Group of Twenty \ncountries to promote LCY bond markets in the developing world. \n\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the role benefits of a government bond \nmarket. Section III discusses the status of public finance in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar \nand their need to tackle the LCY government bond market development challenge in reflection \nof the experience of Vietnam. Section IV examines building blocks of bond market, particularly \ngovernment  bond  market.    Section  V  discusses  how  to  organize  the  effort  to  tackle  the \nchallenge. Section VI discusses experiences of selected countries in tackling it.  Finally, Section \nVII  discusses  links  of  non-central  government  and  corporate  bond  markets  with  government \nbond market for possible further future discussion. \n\nII. \n\nRole and Benefits of a Government Bond Market \n\nLCY  government  bond  markets  enable  the  government  to  fund  public  sector  borrowing \nrequirements at competitive cost while avoiding risks associated with foreign currency funding. \n                                                            \n2 The five original members of ASEAN are Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. The bond \nmarkets of these five economies as well as those of the PRC; Hong Kong, China; the Republic of Korea; and \nViet Nam are monitored by AsianBondsOnline, an online resource developed under ABMI and operated by the \nAsian Development Bank. \n\n2 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nPrior  to  the  1997/98  Asian  financial  crisis,  this  basic  role  of  a  government  bond  market  was \nbarely  exploited  in  developing  Asia.  Most  developing  countries  in  the  region  practiced \nconservative fiscal management while enjoying high growth rates. Public sector borrowing was \nlargely  limited  to  that  from  multilaterals  and  bilaterals  with  concessional  terms  and  long \nmaturities.  On  the  other  hand,  the  fast-growing  private  sector  actively  took  advantage  of  low \ncost  short-term  funds  that  were  readily  available  from  foreign  commercial  sources.    Ironically, \ngovernments\u2019  avoidance  of  borrowing  from  domestic  markets  prevented  the  development  of \ntheir  LCY  bond  markets.  Meanwhile,  private  businesses  relied  on  bank  loans  to  finance  their \ninvestments. \n\nHistorical Growth of ASEAN+3 LCY Bond Market excluding Japan \n\nSource: AsianBondsOnline \n\nThe  crisis  changed  this  paradigm.  As  growing  middle-income  countries,  they  also  needed  to \nfund  expanded  infrastructure  requirements  lest  they  miss  out  on  growth  opportunities  by  not \nsufficiently  investing  in  infrastructure  and  ensuring  a  sound  business  climate to  enhance  living \nstandards.  Most  infrastructure  projects generate  returns  in  a  domestic currency,  thus  requiring \nLCY  financing  to  avoid  currency  risk.  Borrowing  from  multilaterals  and  bilaterals  also  involves \ncurrency  risk,  although  the  overall  risk  is  lower  than  with  commercial  borrowing  due  to \nconcessional  terms  and  long-term  maturities.  Thus,  middle-income  countries  need  to  continue \ndeveloping their LCY bond markets. \n\nAn  LCY  government  bond  market  forms  the  foundation  of  an  economy\u2019s  financial  and  capital \nmarkets because these debt instruments are issued by the single largest and most creditworthy \nissuer in the economy, the government. Government debt bears the \u201cfull faith and credit of the \n\n3 \n\n\f \n\n \n\ngovernment\u201d and is backed by the taxing power provided by the legislative branch. Government \nbonds  are  instruments  for  institutional  investment  and  retail  savings,  and  function  as  pricing \nbenchmarks for other debt instruments in the development of wider financial and capital markets. \nGovernment  bonds,  as  the  highest-quality  credit  assets  available,  are  also  used  as  LCY \ncollateral  or  margin  assets  to  facilitate  banks\u2019  management  of  liquidity  and  counterparty  risks. \nTheir wide availability in the market facilitates banks\u2019 mobilization of LCY deposits and promotes \nuse  of  the  domestic  currency  in  the  economy  (i.e.,  de-dollarization).  This  enables  the  central \nbank to use government securities as a market-based instrument for monetary policy operations. \nWidespread use of the domestic currency in an economy enables the central bank to act as the \nlender of last resort and ensure the stability of the banking system.   \n\nFinancial  intermediaries  and  investors  learn  about  fixed-income  instruments  by  investing  and \ntrading  in  government  bonds.  Given  typically  high  trading  volumes,  bond  dealers  can \ncommercially  justify  building  a  dedicated  fixed-income  trading  desk.  They  can  also  justify \nbuilding  a fixed-income  research  capacity. Without  a government  bond market, such  business \ndevelopment  would  be  difficult,  especially  in  emerging  markets.  A  large  volume  of  highly \nstandardized  and  creditworthy  instruments  held  by  a  wide  range  of  investors  facilitates  bond \ntrading. The resulting high level of market liquidity can help to commercially justify development \nof  a  trading  platform  and  a  large-value  settlement  system.  The  establishment  of  such  capital \nmarket infrastructure is difficult without a developed government bond market. Corporate bonds \nand  other  debt  instruments  can  benefit  from  the  availability  of  such  market  infrastructure,  but \nthey  cannot  by  themselves  commercially  support  its  development  due  to  their  limited  trading \nvolume.  It  in  turn  is  the  result  of  market  fragmentation  of  noncentral  government  bond  market \namid  many  diverse  instruments  and  issuers.  In  that  sense,  a  government  bond  market  can \ncross-subsidize the development of the wider debt market. \n\nPreconditions \n\nFor a government bond market to exist, the government must have borrowing needs generated \nby  deficits  and/or  public  investments. 3  The  country\u2019s  underlying  economy  should  be  of  a \nminimum  size  that  justifies  the  cost  of  market  infrastructure,  operation  and  supervision. \nDepending  on  the  availability  of  alternative  financing  channels,  a  country  with  a  very  small \neconomy might find other options more efficient.4 The threshold to support a government bond \nmarket  has  declined  significantly  due  to  falling  costs  for  market  infrastructure  and  bond \nadministration with the advancement of information technology. \n\nTo  ensure  the  healthy  and  sustainable  growth  of  a  government  bond  market,  the  government \nshould put in place a prudent framework and sound capacity for public debt management. The \ngovernment should carefully control deficits but be allowed to borrow to finance investments in \n                                                            \n3 Examples of issuance without a public sector deficit exist but give rise to political and fund management \nchallenges. Such borrowing can be justified in a small country with an international financial center in \nwhich the financial industry comprises an important segment of the economy.   \n4 Examples include syndicated bank loans, private placement of securities, development of retail markets, \nuse of offshore market or regional solutions. \n\n4 \n\n\f \n\n \n\neconomically  viable  public  projects  that  generate  returns  to  ensure  repayment  of  the  money \nborrowed.  The  government  should  also  be  allowed  to  flexibly  manage  its  short-term  cash \nbalances  and  refinance  or  reprofile  existing  debt  to  optimally  manage  it.  Public  debt \nmanagement objectives could expressly include government bond market development. \n\nMacroeconomic stability with controlled inflation is essential in mobilizing demand for long-\nterm  government  bonds  because  inflation  makes  it  difficult  to  evaluate  the  present  value  of \nfuture  cash  flows  to  be  generated  by  a  bond.  Other  things  being  equal,  the  issuance  of \ngovernment  bonds  with  subsequent  spending  of  the  proceeds  by  the  government  tends  to \nexpand the money supply if the bonds are purchased by commercial banks.  Direct purchase of \ngovernment bonds by the central bank in the primary market is highly expansionary in terms of \nthe  money  supply  and,  therefore,  should  be  avoided  in  principle.  Of course,  this  conventional \nwisdom  has  been  recently  revisited  under  the  practice  of  quantitative  easing  by  which  central \nbanks  in  the  European  Union,  Japan,  and  the  United  States  (US)  have  purchased  massive \namounts of government bonds to fight deflationary pressures. Either way, the authorities need \nto ensure price stability in order to competitively issue government bonds. \n\nCrowding  out  is  another  macroeconomic  concern  that  could  arise.    When  a  government \nregularly  issues  a  large  amount  of  bonds,  it  absorbs  savings  in  the  economy,  leaving  little \nresources available for the private sector. Even though the government will spend the proceeds \nfrom  the  bond  sale  and  the  money  returns  to  the  banking  system,  banking  assets  can  be \ndominated  by  government  bonds  and  banks\u2019  ability  to  lend  to  riskier  private  sector  borrowers \ncan  be  constrained.  This  especially  happens  when  the  central  bank  tries  to  contain \nexpansionary and inflationary pressures generated by government spending. It could undermine \nprivate  sector-led  growth  and  compromise  the  effectiveness  of  government-led  aggregate \ndemand generation. \n\nAnother  macroeconomic  issue  is  the  need  to  ensure  adequate  intergenerational  equity. \nGovernment  borrowing  is  expected  to  finance  public  investments  rather  than  current \nexpenditures  or  deficits.  Many  such  public  investments  are  expected  to  be  in  infrastructure. \nAssuming the average lifespan of an infrastructure is 50 years, then the borrowing to finance the \ninfrastructure  should  be  repaid  over  a  period  of  50  years  so  that  the  generations  bearing  the \nrepayment  burden  can  fully  benefit  from  the  infrastructure  services.  If  the  repayment  period  is \ntoo  short,  older  generations  would  bear  a  higher  repayment  burden  while  younger  ones  will \nenjoy  free  infrastructure  services.  If  the  period  is  too  long,  older  generations  would  receive \ncheap  infrastructure  services  while  allowing  for  the  piling  up  of  public  debt  with  the  burden \nfalling on the shoulder of younger generations for whom the infrastructure is no longer available. \nThe  debt  accumulation  could  continue  to  an  unsustainable  level,  which  could  cause  a  public \ndebt  crisis.  There  are  different  schools  of  economic  thought  on  the  validity  of  this  argument.5  \nHowever, it is considered prudent to set a reasonable repayment policy aligned with the life of \nthe infrastructure. \n                                                            \n5 The neoclassical or rational expectation school argues that people would start saving more as soon as they see a \nstep up in the government borrowing, so the transfer of repayment burden would not be acute. \n\n5 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nThe  financial  sector  should  be  adequately  liberalized  (e.g.,  interest  rates,  credit  decisions), \ncompetitive,  and  solvent.  The  core  of  the  banking  sector  needs  to  be  sound,  especially  in  a \ndeveloping economy whose financial sector is dominated by banks. Banks are expected to be \nkey  participants  in  both  primary  and  secondary  government  bond  markets  and  to  compete  in \npricing bonds, leading to price discovery of government bonds and the determination of market \ninterest rates. In an early stage of bond market development, many governments struggle with \nvolatile and unacceptably high auction yields and, understandably, often impose a ceiling rate.  \nBut  as  both  the  government  and  banks  gain  experience,  the  government  needs  to  be  a  price \ntaker, which will be discussed further below. Development of the government bond market will in \nturn facilitate interest rate liberalization. \n\nIII. \n\nCambodia, Laos People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam \n\nPublic finances in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Myanmar\u2014collectively known as CLM\u2014relies \non  concessional  financing  from  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  These  countries  are  at  a \ncritical  juncture  as  all  three  have  successively  attained  lower-middle-income  status.  CLM \ngovernments  need  to  start  preparing  for  their  graduation  from  concessional  resources  and \nsubsequently  facing  market-based  costs  for  external  financing.  The  CLM  countries  need  to \ndiversify  their  funding  sources  by  developing  domestic  bond  markets  and  reduce  currency \nmismatch  risks  in  financing  public  investments,  particularly  infrastructure.  CLM  countries  are \nlikely  to  have  to  continue  importing  capital  goods  for  the  construction  of  infrastructure.  For  as \nlong  as  the  infrastructure  generates  returns  in  local  currency,  it  will  be  necessary  to  finance \nsuch investments with local currency as much as possible to reduce currency mismatch risks. \n\nGovernments also need to avoid currency mismatch risks and contingent liabilities in the case of \npublic\u2013private partnership (PPP)-based financing of infrastructure if payment commitments are \nin  a  foreign  currency.  If  aggregate  payment  commitments  in  a  foreign  currency  comprise  a \nrelatively  large  share  of  the  (underdeveloped)  foreign  exchange  market  in  an  economy,  it  can \nlead  to  depreciation  or  devaluation  of  the  local  currency.  This  could  in  turn  undermine  the \nprofitability  of  PPPs  or  the  offtaker  if  the  returns  generated  are  in  the  local  currency.  It  could \ntrigger  materialization  of  contingent  liabilities  on  the  government  and  cause  major  stress  on \nfiscal finances and public debt management.6  \n\nViet  Nam  has managed this  transition  process  very  well  since  mid  2000.  It  was  reclassified  in \n2007 as an International Development Association (IDA)\u2013International Bank for Reconstruction \nand  Development  (IBRD)  Blend  Country  by  the  World  Bank,  and  in  2009  as  an  Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  (ADF)\u2013Ordinary  Capital  Resources  (OCR)  Blend  country  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).  These  events  marked  the  start  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  graduation  from  IDA \nand  ADF  concessional  resources  and  its  use  of  IBRD  and  OCR  priced  based  on  a  market-\n\n                                                            \n6 The Lao PDR is a rare exception as it sells electricity to Thailand and receives royalty revenues in Thai baht. The \nLao PDR\u2019s state power company can sign power purchase agreements with independent power producers and \ncommit itself to paying in Thai baht without leading to a currency mismatch risk because it is selling the electricity \nto Thailand and earning revenue Thai baht. \n\n6 \n\n\f \n\n \n\ndetermined global benchmark rate, London Interbank Offered Rate.7  Viet Nam attained lower-\nmiddle-income  status,  based  on  the  criteria  of  the  World  Bank,  in  2010  when  its  per  capita \nincome surpassed $996. \n\nIn anticipation of the start of graduation, Viet Nam explored ways to diversify funding sources in \nthe mid-2000s. The Government of Viet Nam issued its first US dollar bond in the international \nmarket  in  2005.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  started  regularly  issuing  domestic  government  bonds \nto  create  a \nwhile  consolidating  domestic  and  external  debt  management \ncomprehensive  public  debt  management  capacity.  It  also  started  regularly  publishing  an \nissuance calendar and public debt statistics.  Meanwhile, the growing availability of government \nbonds denominated in Vietnamese dong facilitated mobilization of dong deposits by banks and \nde-dollarization of the economy. \n\nfunctions \n\nIn  February  2013,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  issued  the  first  comprehensive  strategy  for  bond \nmarket development covering both government and corporate bonds. Viet Nam expects to fully \ngraduate from World  Bank IDA  and  be  classified  as  an  IBRD  Only  Country  in  2017,  and from \nADB ADF and be classified as an OCR Only Country in 2019. The Government of Viet Nam is \nnow  revising  its  strategy  to  take  domestic  bond  market  development  to  the  next  stage  in \nanticipation of the bond market\u2019s expanded role in funding mounting infrastructure requirements \nas Viet Nam strives to become an upper-middle-income country. \n\nThe CLM countries should strategize their anticipated graduation as Viet Nam has done. \n\nIV. \n\nBuilding Blocks \n\nThe  bond  market  is  not  a  single  institution  but  rather  a  place  of  interaction  between  issuers, \ninvestors, and intermediaries. It is built on market infrastructure for trading and settlement, and \non  laws  and  regulations  including  accounting  rules  and  a  taxation  framework.  Government \nbonds  and  their  primary  market  are  special  parts  of  the  broader  bond  market  that  are  not \ngoverned  by  conventional  securities  law.  Since government  bonds  are  backed  by  the full faith \nand credit of the government, they are regarded as the safest asset in the economy. Disclosure \nof relevant financial information is provided through a parliamentary approval process for fiscal \nbudgets  and  public  debt  management.    As  such,  government  bonds  are  referred  to  as \n\u201cexempted securities.\u201d   \n\nTo  strategize  measures  to  develop  a  government  bond  market,  the  following  building  blocks \nshould be assessed: \n\n(i) \n\npublic finance and debt management,  \n\n                                                            \n7 Viet Nam was classified by the World Bank as an IDA\u2013IBRD Blend Country to mark the start of graduation from \nIDA. Key factors in considering a graduation include (i) per capita income, (ii) public debt sustainability assessed by \nthe International Monetary Fund and multilateral development banks, and (iii) institutional capacity and strength \nof the economy as assessed by multilateral development banks. Regarding (iii), ADB conducts a Country \nPerformance Assessment and the World Bank conducts a Country Policy and Institutional Assessment. \n\n7 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\nmoney markets and monetary policy operations,  \nbond issuance and the primary market,  \ninvestor base (institutions and retail),  \nintermediaries and secondary markets (including repurchase [repo] market),  \nsecurities custody and settlement infrastructure, and  \naccounting and taxation framework conductive to bond market development.   \n\nChallenging reforms are necessary within each building block, while some issues are interlinked \nand/or interdependent across the building blocks. Legal and regulatory issues are imbedded in \nall  of  them  and  therefore  are  to  be  considered  within  the  context  of  each  instead  of  as  a \nseparate building block.   \n\n(i)  Public Finance and Debt Management  \n\nPublic  debt  management  is  a  foundation  of  the  government  debt  market.  It  is  built  on  a \nfoundation of budget planning and execution, and fiscal management with effective monitoring, \nanalysis,  and  control  of  revenues  and  expenditures.  A  legal  framework  must  allow  the \ngovernment  to  borrow  without  undue  constraints  (borrowing  authority),  while  being  prudent  to \nensure  debt  sustainability.  The  principle  of  fiscal  discipline  and  a  balanced  budget  is  very \nimportant  but  should  not  preclude  the  possibility  of  borrowing  to  finance  economically  viable \npublic investments including those in infrastructure. A debt management legal framework should \nprovide for a market-based funding strategy. An annual borrowing limit should be set in terms of \na net, not gross, amount to allow the government to flexibly refinance and reprofile existing debt \nand  manage  short-term  cash  balances.  A  debt  management  legal  framework  should  allow  for \neffective  communication  and  information  sharing  with  the  investor  community  and  the  central \nbank for coordination with monetary policy operations. \n\nA  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  government  debt  management  should  clearly  state  its \nobjectives,  which  should  include:  (a)  the  timely  and  secure  funding  of  required  public  sector \nfinances  and  (b)  doing  so  at  the  least  cost  in  the  long-term  while  taking  into  account  the \nassociated  risks.  The  need  to  manage  risks,  in  addition  to  minimizing  costs,  is  particularly \nimportant.  A  framework  should  also  define  the  delegation  of  the  government\u2019s  borrowing \nauthority to debt managers to ensure that their borrowing binds the government to assume the \nliabilities arising from it. The responsibilities and functions of all officials involved should also be \ndefined  and  publicly  disclosed,  including  those  related  to  debt  issuance,  restructuring,  and \nrefinancing;  as  well  as  secondary  market  arrangements,  clearing  and  settlement  (C&S) \narrangements  for  government  securities,  and  debt  management  policy  advice.  Effective \nexecution of these actions requires an efficient and well-functioning domestic government debt \nmarket  with  a  broad  investor  base.    Therefore,  a  growing  number  of  countries  include \ngovernment debt market development as the third objective of the public debt management.  \n\nRisks inherent in the structure of the government debt\u2014currency, term, floating rate\u2014should be \nmonitored, evaluated, and mitigated by modifying the debt structure and identifying the cost of \ndoing so. Debt managers should regularly conduct stress tests of the debt portfolio, taking into \naccount  possible  economic  and  financial  shocks  to  the  government  and  the  economy  as  a \n8 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nwhole. Debt managers should also carefully consider exposure to contingent liabilities, including \nthose arising from PPPs, and their potential impact on the government\u2019s financial position. The \ngovernment  should  have  a  policy  to  price  guarantees  and  limit  or  deter  the  proliferation  of \ncontingent liabilities, and develop a mechanism and the capacity to finance such liabilities if and \nwhen they are realized (e.g., an extra-budgetary guarantee fund).   \n\nGovernment  cash  managers  should  consider  the  financial  and  other  risk  characteristics  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s cash flows and ensure that its financial obligations are met cost effectively as they \nfall due. They need to be able to accurately project the volume and timing of the government\u2019s \nfuture cash inflows through tax, customs, and other revenues, as well as the volume and timing \nof outflows through salary payments, public expenditures, and redemption of outstanding debt, \nthus  identifying  future  cash  balances  and  profiles,  including  any  seasonality.  They  should  be \nable  to  timely  replenish  expected  future  cash  shortfalls,  typically  by  issuing  short-term \ninstruments  such  as  Treasury  bills  or  financing  bills.  Sound  government  cash  management \nshould  stabilize,  as  well  as  minimize,  the  government\u2019s  cash  balance,  thus  enabling  the \ngovernment to reduce the volume of debt and associated costs.  \n\nTo optimally manage the government\u2019s cash balance, funds should be kept in a single account, \ntypically  at  the  central  bank  in  the  form  of  a  Treasury  Single  Account  (TSA).  A  TSA  not  only \nfacilitates fiscal and financial planning but also allows the relevant finance ministry to minimize \nthe  volume  of  idle  cash  with  consequent  cost  savings.  On  the  other  hand,  changes  in  the \ngovernment\u2019s  cash  balance  in  the  TSA  directly  impacts  the  reserve  balance  of  the  banking \nsector.  The  central  bank  therefore  has  to  sterilize  the  impacts  with  day-to-day  open  market \noperations  and  stabilize  the  liquidity  position  of  the  banking  system  while  influencing  money \nmarket  interest  rates.  The  less  volatile  the  cash  flow  across  the  TSA,  the  easier  the  central \nbank\u2019s monetary operations are to execute. The government also benefits from such operations \nof  the  central  bank  because  a  stable  and  predictable  money  market  is  helpful  for  the \ngovernment to smoothly conduct its borrowing operations. Thus, the government and the central \nbank  need  to  frequently  communicate  and  systematically  coordinate  their  actions,  including \nexchanging  cash  flow  forecasts,  without  compromising  the  independence  of  their  respective \nmonetary and fiscal policies.  \n\nDebt and cash management activities should be supported by an accurate and comprehensive \nmanagement information system with proper safeguards. Sound business recovery procedures \nshould  be  in  place  to  mitigate  the  risk  of  business  interruptions,  including  natural  disasters, \npower cuts, social unrest, and terrorism. \n\n(ii)  Money Markets and Monetary Policy Operations  \n\nA central bank in an economy that is developing its bond market needs to avoid relying heavily \non direct monetary policy tools such as interest rate control and credit ceilings, and instead use \nmore  effective  indirect  tools  like  open  market  operations.  The  Interbank  market  should  be \nliberalized  to  allow  banks  to  compete  in  pricing  (interest  rate)  and  actively  trade  money  and \nbonds.  The  central  bank  can  incentivize  banks  to  trade  liquidity  actively  by,  for  example, \nshortening  the  reserve  compliance  period.  It  could  also  exclude  interbank  borrowing  from \n9 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nreserve  requirements.8 On  the  other  hand,  the  latest  regulatory  approach  under  Basel  III  may \nencourage repo transactions to replace some interbank deposits or call loans as it could reduce \ncapital charges against counterparty risk while allowing for repo securities to be recognized as \nhigh  quality  liquid  assets  depending  on  the  form  they  take.  Most  importantly,  the  central  bank \nneeds to minimize excess liquidity in the banking system\u2014the aggregate balance in commercial \nbanks\u2019 reserve accounts at the central bank in excess of the required reserves\u2014on a day-to-day \nbasis. It is key to creating the market conditions in which banks can competitively trade liquidity \namong themselves. \n\nTo  manage  the  level  of  aggregate  excess  liquidity  in  the  banking  system,  the  central  bank \nneeds  to  closely  coordinate  with  the  government\u2019s  cash  management  operations  because \nvolatility in the government\u2019s cash balance directly impacts the reserve balance of banks at the \ncentral  bank.  When  the  government  receives  tax  and  other  revenues,  commercial  banks\u2019 \ncurrent  accounts  at  the  central  bank  are  debited  to  make  payments  to  the  government.  An \nopposite  impact  on  the  banks\u2019  reserve  balance  is  caused  when  the  government  spends  its \ncash.9 The central bank needs to sterilize such impacts on the banks\u2019 reserve balance with day-\nto-day monetary operations. \n\nTo absorb daily excess liquidity in the banking system, however, the central bank should avoid \nrelying heavily on a standing accommodation facility. An accommodation facility offered by the \ncentral bank tends to be effective in absorbing excess liquidity because it exposes banks to no \ncounterparty  risk  under  the  Basel  III  capital  accords.  It  can  be  particularly  effective  when  it  is \ngenerously remunerated.10 But then banks would not trade liquidity among themselves, and the \ninterbank money market would not develop. The central bank needs to reduce the remuneration \nand  penalize  banks  that  do  not  seek  counterparties  in  the  interbank  market  and  come  to  the \ncentral bank to dump the excess liquidity. \n\nThe government needs to be able to manage its cash balance to minimize idle cash, volatility, \nand seasonality. Some government revenues are received periodically and some expenditures \nsuch as salaries are made periodically, which creates seasonal volatility in the government cash \nbalance.  Such  seasonality  should  be  predictable.  Major  payments  by  the  government \nassociated  with  procurement  for  public  projects  can  be  anticipated,  provided  that  the  finance \nministry  communicates  closely  with  line  authorities  and  state-owned  enterprises.  Thus,  the \nfinance  ministry  should  be  able  to  predict  such  seasonality  and  counteract  its  impacts  by \nprefunding  anticipated  shortages  with  Treasury  bills  and  redeeming  those  against  anticipated \nsurpluses. \n\nA key tool in managing government cash balance is the TSA, which consolidates cash holdings \nof different line authorities into one account while maintaining notional subaccounts for the line \n\n                                                            \n8 This requires that there is no conflict with the spirit of the latest regulatory approach under Basel III that \ndiscourages market-based funding (i.e., net stable Funding ratio). \n9 Another major cause of volatility in banks\u2019 reserve positions is the seasonality in the demand for bank notes. \n10 For example, if it offers an interest rate competitive with the interbank market rate. \n\n10 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nauthorities.  A  TSA  is  to  be  held  at  the  central  bank  and  linked  with  an  interbank  payments \nsystem.  The  central  bank  can  observe  the  TSA  balance  as  well  as  outgoing  and  incoming \npayments  on  a  day-to-day  basis.  Thus,  the  central  bank  is  well  positioned  to  provide \nmanagement  services  for  the  government\u2019s  cash  balance  as  a  fiscal  agent.  The  central  bank \ncan  manage  the  issuance  and  redemption  of  Treasury  bills  on  behalf  of  the  government  and \nconduct  the  rough-tuning  of  the  cash  balance.  It  can  also  auction  the  remaining  government \ncash  balance  daily  in  the  interbank  market  to  minimize  idle  cash  and  optimize  returns  on  the \nbalance.11 Clearly, the monetary policy department of the central bank and the government cash \nand debt managers need to closely communicate and coordinate their daily operations while not \ncompromising the independence of their respective monetary and fiscal policies.  \n\nThe  issuance  of Treasury  bills  contributes  to the  deepening  of the money  market. The central \nbank can use repos on government bonds with banks to stabilize the reserve balance of banks. \nThe finance ministry can also consider allowing the central bank to conduct add-on issuances of \nTreasury  bills  as  part  of  its  monetary  operations.12 Banks,  on  the  other  hand,  trade  their  cash \nsurpluses  in  the  money  market.  As  bond  dealers,  banks  can  also  fund  their  holdings  of \ngovernment bonds in the money market. A key instrument for such funding operations is repos, \nwhether with the central bank or with other market participants as counterparty. When the term \nstructure of interest rates is upward sloping, banks can trade liquidity along the yield curve and \nearn  returns  through  the  term  transformation.  Such  activities  by  banks  and  the  central  bank \nfurther deepen the money market and its linkages with the government bond market. \n\n(iii) Bond Issuance and the Primary Market \n\nThe government  should develop  an  issuance  strategy  based  on  the funding  requirements  and \ntheir timing, instruments and issuance methods, investor base, and the level of market access \nby different groups of investors. The government needs to provide market participants and the \npublic with sufficient information about its debt structure, funding needs, and debt management \nissuance  calendar,  description  of \nstrategies.  This \noutstanding  securities,  schedule  for  reopening  and  buyback  operations,  and  treasury  cash \nbalance.  In  formulating  debt  management  strategies,  the  government  needs  to  systematically \nconsult  key  market  participants  to  understand  sources  of  demand,  select  appropriate \ninstruments to mobilize demand, and remove impediments to investing in them.   \n\nincludes  an  amortization  schedule, \n\nThe  government  needs  to  develop  instruments  to  mobilize  demand  from  different  sources. \nTo promote wide acceptance by a broad range of investors, a simple design is important. Fixed-\ncoupon bonds are the most common type of instrument, with the coupon rate being near auction \n                                                            \n11 The Bank of Canada auctions government\u2019s cash balance to zero it every day. It enables the Canadian \ngovernment to fully earn returns on its cash balance while eliminating the impact of government cash balance \nseasonality on the banking system liquidity. \n12 In UK, the debt management office issues add-on Treasury bills at the request of the Bank of England to help the \ncentral bank conduct sell operations when it does not have a sufficient stock of government securities. The \narrangement allows the central bank to avoid issuing its own securities, which would fragment the market. \nHowever, the government and the central bank need to agree upfront on the cost sharing for such operations. \n\n11 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nyield.  Floating-rate  instruments  could  attract  demand  from  investors  who  need  to  manage \ninterest  rate  risk.  However,  floating-rate  instruments  are  not  expected  to  be  traded  actively, \nsignificantly  limiting  secondary  market  liquidity.  They  also  require  reliable  6-month  money \nmarket  rate  to  price  the  floating  rate,  which  is  not  commonly  available  in  emerging  markets. \nFloating-rate instruments have been found to be useful in Latin American economies that have \nhistorically suffered from inflation and weak savings. However, many Asian economies have a \nstrong savings culture and have been able to issue medium- and long-term fixed-coupon bonds \nfrom  an  early  stage.  Many  Asian  economies  have  struggled  more  with  building  a  sound \ngovernment  cash  management  capacity  using  short-term  Treasury  bills.  Inflation-linked  bonds \nare now increasingly found in economies where pension funds are growing. \n\nThe  government  needs  to  be  a  price  taker  in  issuing  bonds.  If  it  cannot  avoid  controlling  the \nyield  in  the  primary  market  due  to  an  unacceptably  high  yield  or  volatility  in  the  early  stage  of \nmarket development, it needs to identify steps to become a price taker as soon as possible. It is \npossible  to  place  government  bonds  at  a  below-market  rate  by  motivating  market  participants \nwith  regulations. 13  However,  a  negative  side  effect  of  such  practice  can  be  severe:  the \nsecondary market fails to materialize because the first seller in the secondary market would be \nforced to accept significant capital losses.   \n\nThe  government  needs  to  develop  capacity  to  employ  several  issuance  methods  such  as \ncompetitive  auction,  syndicated  underwriting,  private  placement,  and  tap  issuance. The \ngovernment  should  select  its  issuance  method  and  instruments  depending  on  the  market \nconditions  and  demand  sources.  Competitive  auction  is  most  useful  for  benchmark  bonds \nregularly issued in large quantities to experienced market participants. Syndicated underwriting \nis useful for tapping new sources of demand or for the introduction of new instruments for which \ndemand  is  uncertain.  Private  placement  can  be negotiated to  place  very  long-term  bonds to  a \nsmall number of expected investors such as pension funds and life insurance companies. Tap \nissuance  can  be  used  to  mobilize  demand  from  retail  investors  and  nonfinancial  corporate \ntreasuries.   \n\nThe dematerialization of securities (electronic securities) has greatly enhanced the feasibility of \nthe  direct  sale  of  bonds  to  end  investors.  Online  networks  offer  new  possibilities  for  the \ngovernment  to  tap  demand  directly  from  end  investors.  They  are  particularly  useful  in  tapping \ndemand  from  retail  investors  because  of  an  extensive  reach  to  the  public  at  low  marginal \ncosts.14 The government, or the central bank acting as its fiscal agent, must establish a sound \nelectronic bond registry. Individuals could buy bonds through intermediaries such as banks and \nbroker\u2013dealers  or  fixed-income  mutual  funds.  In  the  case  where  a  mobile  telephone  company \nmaintains retail investor accounts, special regulatory arrangements would be necessary. \n\n                                                            \n13 For example, by accepting government bond holdings as part of banks\u2019 required reserves. \n14 There are a growing number of internet-based platforms to sell government bonds around the world. For \nexample, Kenya\u2019s M-Akiba enables individuals to buy government securities using a mobile phone. \n\n12 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nNevertheless,  the  government  generally  needs  to  emphasize  competitive  auctions  to  enhance \nthe reliability of market-determined yield. This can be done as primary market participants gain \nexperience in competitive bidding and as the institutional investor base is broadened. Emerging \nmarkets tend to start with single-price auctions and consider adopting multiple price auctions as \nmarket  participants  gain  experiences  in  bidding.  A  mixed  auction  is  another  option,  which  has \nbeen adopted in the PRC, and is useful in promoting price discovery in the primary market by \ninstitutions  with  stronger  pricing  ability  while  at  the  same  time  allowing  more  institutions  with \nless pricing ability to participate.15 The government needs to periodically update and announce \nits  issuance  calendar  to  the  market  to  help  primary  market  participants  in  preparing  to  bid \naggressively  at  auctions.  It  needs to  develop  a methodology  to reopen and  refinance  existing \nseries  of  bonds  to  consolidate  them  into  a  limited  number  of  large  benchmark  series  to \nenhance  their  tradability  and  thus  secondary  market  liquidity.  It  also  needs  to  be  able  to \nrefinance  bonds  series  as  they  shift  in  and  out  of  relevant  benchmark  maturity  segments  and \navoid the concentration of redemptions.   \n\nMore  advanced  issuance  techniques,  such  as  buyback  programs,  exchange  offers,  and \nswitch  auctions  should  be  used  to  refinance  existing  bonds  and  standardize  instruments  to \npromote  their  liquidity  in  the  secondary  market.  An  issuing  strategy  should  weigh  the \npreferences  of  investors  against  the  government\u2019s  own  cost  and  risk  targets  and  debt \nmanagement  objectives.  It  should  seek  to  promote  benchmark  issues  in  key  maturities  that \nfacilitate  the  growth  of  secondary  markets.  Effective  coordination  between  the  fiscal  and \nmonetary authorities is essential for avoiding auction failures, especially when the central bank \nissues  its  own  securities  or  bills  in  maturity  segments  in  which  government  securities  are  also \nissued.  \n\nThe  government  can  consider  establishing  a  primary  dealer  (PD)  system  to  promote  the \ndevelopment of both the primary and the secondary markets. A PD system can include a set of \nprivileges and obligations for PDs, although there is no common international definition of what \nconstitutes a PD system. A common idea is for the government to provide certain privileges for \nqualified  intermediaries  acting  as  PDs  in  exchange  for  their  performing  certain  obligatory \nservices to help the government meet its debt management objectives.   \n\nGenerally,  the  privilege  of  being  a  PD  comes  from  exclusivity  in  accessing  the  primary  and \nsecondary markets (e.g., the exclusive right to participate in government bond auctions), which \ncan lead to reduced competition and increased risk of collusion among PDs. PDs are also often \ndesignated to be exclusive counterparties to the central bank in its open market operations, thus \nbenefiting  from  seeing  monetary  policy  signals  ahead  of  other  market  participants.  As  such, \nwhen nonbanks are included among PDs, they are given current accounts at the central bank in \nsome  countries.  On  the  other  hand,  obligatory  services  could  include  commitments  to  bid  to \npurchase a certain share of government bonds issued over a certain period, sell them to a wide \n                                                            \n15 In a mixed auction, the bidders whose bidding interest rates are lower than or equal to the average winning bid \nbuy the bond at the average winning bid, while the bidders whose bidding interest rates are higher than the \naverage winning bid buy the bond at their own bidding interest rates. \n\n13 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nrange  of  end  investors,  regularly  and  frequently  provide  the  government  with  feedback  on \nmarket  demand,  and  actively  make  a  market  for  government  bonds.  Market  making  to  create \nliquidity in the secondary market for government bonds is often key to maximizing the benefit of \na PD system.   \n\nMarket  making  is  a  risky  business  for  bond  dealers,  and  only  well-capitalized  and  competent \nbond dealers can perform it. It necessitates a two-step approach to establishing a PD system.  \nThe  government,  or  the  central  bank  acting  as  its  agent,  first  needs  to  select  qualified \nintermediaries  based  on  objective  criteria  such  as  financial  soundness,  capital  base, \ncompetency in monetary and fixed-income research, and the presence of a fixed-income trading \ndesk with qualified fixed-income traders. Next, the authority needs to monitor an intermediary\u2019s \nperformance against its obligations as a PD, including market making over a period of time, to \neventually  finalize  the  selection  of  PDs.  Performance  monitoring  must  continue  indefinitely \nbecause  an  underperformer  needs  to  be  replaced  with  a  qualified  intermediary  to  make \nmembership  in  the  PD  system  contestable.  Otherwise,  this  exclusive  club  could  become \nuncompetitive. Monitoring the performance of intermediaries in terms of market making is often \nchallenging  when  the  secondary  bond  market  is  poorly  organized,  resulting  in  a  lack  of \ntransparency.   \n\nThe  feasibility  of  market  making  is  preconditioned  upon  the  achievement  of  delivery-versus-\npayment  (DVP)  settlement  of  bond  trades,  the  development  of  repo  markets,  and/or  the \navailability  of  government  securities  lending  services.  It  is  because  DVP  settlement  can \nsignificantly  reduce  the  counterparty  risk  in  market  making.  Repo  market  or  government \nsecurities lending services can reduce the inventory of government bonds that a market maker \nneeds to hold, thus reducing the interest rate risk associated with holding inventory. Interest rate \nor government bond futures and when-issued market can also help a market maker reduce the \ninventory of bonds it needs for market making and hedge the interest rate risk associated with \nholding  inventory.  When  such  preconditions  are  unmet,  market  making  can  be  a  highly  risky \nbusiness for bond dealers and may not be feasible, thus reducing the viability of a PD system. \n\nThus,  designing  a  sustainable  PD  system  requires  careful  consideration  of  market  conditions.  \nOne  of  the  most  basic  conditions  is  that  there  should  be  an  adequate  number  of  market \nparticipants  and  investors  because  otherwise  limiting  the  participation  in  the  primary  market \nwould  excessively  weaken  direct  demand  and  competition  in  the  market.  Therefore,  a  PD \nsystem is generally unsuitable for a very small economy. \n\nGovernments  need  to  consider  the  pros  and  cons  of  a  PD  system  in  the  context  of  the  latest \ntechnology available in organizing the primary and secondary markets. In the primary market, it \nis increasingly possible for the government to directly reach out to end investors to place bonds \nand  mobilize  demand  widely  given  the  availability  of  public  networks  with  low  marginal  costs \nsuch  as  web-based  platforms  on  computers  and  mobile  phones.  In the  secondary  market,  the \navailability of an electronic trading platform can enhance market liquidity and reduce the value \naddition  of  market-making  services,  although  greater  transparency  could  facilitate  the \nperformance monitoring of PDs. From the standpoint of bond dealers, the better organized and \n\n14 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nmore transparent secondary market is squeezing the bid\u2013ask spread, leading to market making \nbeing less lucrative. These developments are altering the pros and cons of a PD system and its \noptimal  design.  Governments  need  to  consider  the  adoption  of  a  PD  system  in  this  new \nenvironment. \n\n(iv) Investor Base (Institutions and Retail) \n\nGovernment  securities  should  be  accessible  to  different  groups  of  investors.  A  broad  and \ndiverse  investor  base\u2014with  different  investment  time  horizons,  risk  appetites,  and  trading \nmotives\u2014is  vital for  ensuring  stable  demand for government  securities across  various tenures \nand promoting an active and stable secondary market. A heterogeneous investor base and the \nresultant  high  level  of  liquidity  are  critical  for  enabling  the  government  to  execute  its  funding \nstrategy under a wide range of market conditions.  \n\nThe structure and composition of the investor base is closely linked to the state of development \nand  sophistication  of  a  country\u2019s  financial  system.  A  diverse  investor  base  with  diverse \ninvestment  motives  and  time  horizons  stabilizes  demand  for  bonds  among  various  maturities.  \nThe  development  of  contractual  savings  institutions  is  critical  to  diversifying  the  investor  base \nsince pension funds and insurance companies provide a natural market for medium- and long-\nterm government debt.  \n\nIn frontier market economies where the nonbanking financial sector is small, banks tend to form \na  core  group  of  investors  in  the  government  securities  market  in  addition  to  their  role  as \nintermediaries  and  custodians  of  these  instruments.  Broadening  the  investor  base  beyond  the \nbanking sector is a key challenge for such markets. It requires the development of contractual \nsavings institutions (pension funds and insurance companies), collective investment funds, and \nthe asset management industry. It is also increasingly important to reach out to retail investors \nand corporate treasuries, and allow the participation of foreign investors with appropriate macro-\nprudential safeguards.     \n\nAsia  trails  behind  Latin  America  with  respect  to  pension  reforms.  Among  ADB\u2019s  developing \nmember  countries,  only  Kazakhstan  and  Georgia  have  second  pillar  pension  schemes,  which \ncan  be  understood  as  funded  (defined  contribution)  schemes,  with  mandatory  participation  for \nall  wage  earners,  that  are  privately  and  competitively  managed.  While  involving  its  own \nchallenges,  second  pillar  pension  funds  drive  the  accumulation  of  long-term  savings  over  an \nextended  time  horizon  in  a  predictable  manner.  With  the  lack  of  such  schemes,  Asian \neconomies are struggling to meet the strong demand for long-term finances despite high levels \nof  gross  domestic  savings.  Some  upper-middle-income  Asian  economies,  as  well  as  high- \nincome ones, are already entering the ageing cycle of their population. They need to strengthen \nfunded  pension  schemes  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  public  pension  and  social  security \nsystems. At the same time, Asian governments need to recognize funded pension schemes as \n\n15 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nboth  providers  of  old-age  financial  security  and  long-term  institutional  investors  as  many  Latin \nAmerican and East European countries have done.16 \n\nThe presence of insurance companies is growing in emerging Asian economies. In addition to \ntheir core insurance business, life insurers can offer annuities. Retirees can invest a portion of \ntheir lump-sum retirement benefits to buy annuities if their pension fund or provident fund does \nnot  directly  offer  annuities.  In  that  way,  insurance  companies,  together  with  pension  and \nprovident  funds,  can  build  a  large  pool  of  long-term  savings  that  can  be  a  major  source  of \ndemand for long-term, fixed-income securities. \n\nWhile pension reform is a major social and political undertaking, collective investment schemes \ncan  be  developed  in  conjunction  with  the  asset  management  industry.  Contractual  savings \ninstitutions  could  benefit  from  opportunities  to  invest  in  fixed-income  collective  funds.  Fixed- \nincome funds  comprising government  bonds  offer  a  safe  deposit  substitute for retail  investors.  \nIn  pursuing  such  developments,  investor  education  is  important.  Inexperienced  retail  investors \nin emerging markets often lack understanding of why funds in government securities can lose or \nchange value on a daily basis. In some cases, a significant loss of net asset value has triggered \npanicked runs on fixed-income funds, which exacerbated volatility in the secondary market and \nmade it difficult to place new government bonds in the primary market. Open-end mutual funds \nare more vulnerable to such runs, especially  when they invest in long-term government bonds \ninstead  of  short-  and  medium-term  ones.  Thus,  appropriate  securities  regulations  for  investor \nprotection are necessary in addition to investor education. \n\nGovernment  bonds  as  highly  creditworthy  and  liquid  securities  are  suitable for  retail  investors.  \nThat  justifies  direct  sale  to  retail  investors  by  use  of  today\u2019s  information  and  communication \ntechnology to mobilize demand. Information and communication technology also enables direct \nmobilization of demand from nonfinancial corporates and foundations, among others. Yet, direct \nsale  to  end  investors  creates  a  pricing  challenge,  which  can  be  addressed  only  through  a \ncompetitive institutional market.   \n\nForeign  investors  can  bring  valuable  capital  into  emerging  markets  through  fixed-income \nmarkets.  Liquid  markets  like  a  government  bond  market  tend  to  attract  foreign  investors, \nespecially in high-growth Asia with its prospects for real appreciation of local currencies in the \nlong-term.  Yet,  demand  from  foreign  portfolio  investors  with  foreign  currency  liabilities  can  be \ncyclical  as  they  are  sensitive  to  currency  risk.  Bond  market can  address  the  double mismatch \nproblem in the balance sheet of businesses that caused the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis, but it \nin the process creates a new channel of potentially cyclical foreign capital flows that can cause \nmacro-level stress to foreign exchange liquidity in the economy (international reserves) and the \nexchange  rate.  Thus,  the  government  needs  to  put  in  place  a  macro-prudential  framework  to \nmonitor and control speculative investments.   \n\n                                                            \n16 Chile has been a leader in Latin America in terms of pension reform, followed by Colombia and Peru, among \nothers. In Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Poland, and \nRussia had developed second pillar pension funds, while Georgia is currently establishing one. \n\n16 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nForeign  investors  in  LCY  bonds  need  to  hedge  their  currency  risk  to  feel  comfortable  in \nincreasing their investment exposure to this asset class. As such, the development of deep and \nliquid  foreign  exchange  and  derivatives  markets  complements  the  growth  of  the  LCY  bond \nmarket.  Many  developing  Asian  economies  restrict  participation  of  foreign  investors  in  their \nonshore derivatives market, and there is limited convertibility of their currencies. This has led to \nthe formation of offshore non-deliverable forward markets to address the strong demand for risk \nmanagement  and  hedging  tools  to  manage  risk  from  onshore  exposures,  typically  with \ninvestments in LCY bonds. More developed financial markets allow foreign investors access to \nthe onshore derivatives market, which broadens and deepens not just the investor base for LCY \nbonds, but also the onshore derivatives market.   \n\nEmerging  market  authorities  should  consider  making  the  over-the-counter  (OTC)  foreign \nexchange derivatives markets more transparent and safer for trading, for example, by use of a \ntrade  repository  for  transparency  or  a  central  counterparty  for  clearing  to  reduce  counterparty \nrisk. That should allow more effective regulation of the market and risk management among its \nparticipants,  and  help  facilitate  hedging  by  investors,  including  foreign  investors.  Doing  so \nshould  help  integrate  the  onshore  and  offshore  markets,  and  deepen  and  broaden  the \nintegrated  market.  For  standardized  foreign  exchange  derivatives  such  as  foreign  exchange \nfutures  and  options  contracts,  listing  the  products  on  an  exchange  can  also  help  smaller \nregional institutional investors with limited access to the offshore non-deliverable forward market \nbenefit from a regulated, safe, and inexpensive trading environment. Such arrangements should \nfacilitate  small  institutional  investors  of  the  region  to  hedge  their  exposures  as  prime  brokers \nhave reduced their credit lines to them.   \n\nTo  manage  capital  flows,  host  country  authorities  need  to  understand  two  things.  One  is  the \nsource and nature of money (identities of end investors and their investment motives) and the \nother is the destination of the money (whether the money is invested in short-term liquid assets \nor long-term illiquid ones). A key challenge for the authorities is to distinguish between bona fide \nlong-term  foreign  investors  and  short-term  speculators.  Even  if  some  foreign  funds  appear \nmedium-  to  long-term  oriented,  the  performance  of  their  fund  managers  is  evaluated  in  the \nshort-term based on fair value accounting rules (mark-to-market or mark-to-model). That makes \ntheir  behavior  short-term  oriented  and  pro-cyclical,  especially  when  they  are  open-end  funds.  \nThe Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor scheme of the PRC, or a locally adapted equivalent, \ncan be effective in addressing this. Adoption of a Legal Entity Identifier assigned to each legal \nentity  can  help  identify  and  monitor  end  investors  offshore  and  their  investment  motives. 17  \nFinancial regulators will be able to assess risks at the firm level as well as at the systemic level. \n\nA more fundamental challenge in this regard is to develop a deep and diverse domestic investor \nbase, particularly an institutional investor base, that can absorb the shocks that may be caused \n\n                                                            \n17 The Legal Entity Identifier was developed by the Group of Twenty to identify business entities uniquely so that \ntheir financial transactions in different national jurisdictions could be fully tracked.  It is non-proprietary data that \nis freely accessible to all. Over 435,000 legal entities from more than 195 countries have now been issued with \nLegal Entity Identifier. \n\n17 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nby capital flows. The improved ability of emerging Asian bond markets to withstand the shocks \nof the  tapering  of quantitative  easing  by the  United  States  Federal  Reserve  demonstrated this \nwell.  The  government  bond  markets  of  Indonesia  and  Malaysia,  which  had  and  still  have  a \nhigher proportion of foreign holdings than other Asian markets, are good examples.  \n\n(v)  Intermediaries and Secondary Markets (including Repo Markets) \n\nWell-functioning  secondary  markets  promote  efficient  price  discovery  and  transparency, \nfacilitate  liquidity  and  risk  management,  and  bolster  the  development  of  the  primary  market. \nThey do so by providing a cost-efficient environment in which market participants can trade in a \nfair  and  transparent  manner.  They  provide  an  exit  mechanism  for  investors  in  medium-  and \nlong-term  securities,  while  permitting  governments  to  issue  long-term  debt  to  better  manage \ntheir exposure to interest rate and rollover risks.  \n\nDeveloping an active and liquid secondary market requires sufficient market intermediaries and \ninstitutional  investors  with  diverse  motives  to  invest  and  trade  appropriate  instruments  using \ndifferent  transaction  types  and  well-established  trading  mechanisms.  Such  mechanisms  cover \nnot  only  the  standardized  transaction  conventions  and  technical  infrastructure  for  trading, \nclearing,  and  settlement  facilities,  but  also  prudential  and  business  conduct  rules,  effective \nmarket  surveillance,  and  investor  protection.  Different  groups  of  market  participants\u2014such  as \ndealers,  interdealer  brokers,  and  institutional  investors\u2014play  different  roles  in  the  market  and \nare  faced  with  different  business  interests  that  often  conflict.  A  sound  secondary  market \nstructure is one that reconciles and balances them well. \n\nTrading activity and liquidity are heightened when a competitive market structure is established. \nTo enhance the tradability of government bonds, bond instruments need to be consolidated in a \nlimited  number  of  standardized  and  simple  instruments  (benchmarks).  Transaction  costs, \nincluding  transaction  taxes,  need  to  be  minimized.  Market  infrastructure  needs  to  be  made \noperationally  efficient  and  robust,  and  market  participants  should  have  varying  transaction \nneeds and investment horizons. Primary dealers or market-makers and interdealer brokers that \nfacilitate trading among dealers often contribute to greater market liquidity. \n\nBonds  are  traded  predominantly  in  OTC  markets,  which  tend  to  lack  transparency  unless \nconscious  efforts  are  made  to  better  organize  them.  As  a  starting  point,  transaction \nconventions should be standardized in accordance with international standards. Private market \ninformation  vendors  are  usually  not  able  to  fully  capture  all  transactions  because  only  major \nmarket participants with high trading volumes can afford to subscribe to their expensive systems. \nThus, market participants, particularly bond dealers and interdealer brokers, should be required \nto  report  their  transactions  (post-trade  price  and  volume)  to  a  designated  trade  repository \nimmediately (e.g., within 10 minutes) after the trade. There should be arrangements in place to \nmonitor compliance with this requirement and penalties imposed for noncompliance.  The trade \nrepository  or  its  associated  trade  information  system  should  publicly  provide  information  on \nbenchmarks.  \n\n18 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nThe role of trade associations and self-regulatory organizations (SROs), such as a bankers\u2019 or a \nbond  market  association,  is  important  in  enhancing  the  efficiency  and  transparency  of  the \nmarket  and  reliability  of  benchmarks.  It  is  the  role  of  such  trade  associations  and  SROs  to \npromote the standardization of transaction conventions. They can also register bonds and play \nthe  role  of  bond  pricing  agency  for  illiquid  bonds  that  commercial  market  information  vendors \nmay  not  be  able  to  provide.18 Emerging  bond  markets  as  well  as  some  more  developed  bond \nmarkets  have  a  significant  number  of  bonds  that  are  not  traded  every  day.  The  availability  of \npricing information for such illiquid bonds not only facilitates trading but also enables institutional \ninvestors  to  evaluate  or  disclose  the  net  asset  value  of  their  bond  portfolios  and  comply  with \nprudential requirements. Therefore, bond pricing agencies need to develop models to rationally \nprice such bonds. \n\nTrade associations and SROs also need to play an important role as an administrator of money \nand bond benchmarks. Their failure to play a proper role can result in unreliable benchmarks as \nwas seen in the case of LIBOR manipulation. Benchmarks are used to price all money and debt \ninstruments, including loans for consumers, and their manipulation can cause profound damage \nto the public\u2019s trust in money and debt markets. The central bank and/or the securities regulator \nshould  consider  requiring  the  registration  of  market  information  vendors  with  a  requirement  to \nprovide monitoring access to the market through their terminals. It is because the administrator \nof benchmarks needs to rely on the platforms of the vendors and their networks to collect pricing \ninformation  from  market  participants,  process  it,  and  disseminate  it  back  to  the  market.19 In \ndoing so, it is increasingly important to make use of post-trade transaction information instead of \nrelying  on  pre-trade  price  quotes  by  dealers.  If  their  platforms  enable  market  participants  to \nexecute trades, they should be more formally regulated because they would be functioning as a \ntrading platform.20 \n\nThey  could  also  better  organize  the  secondary market  by  using  electronic  trading  platforms  to \npromote market transparency and liquidity, and to enhance the reliability of benchmarks and the \nyield  curve.  The  secondary  market  and  its  platforms  should  be  designed  to  reconcile  the \nconflicting business interests of bond dealers and buy-side investors. Bond dealers are reluctant \nto share their price quotes (pre-trade price information) beyond their clients because they invest \ntheir  resources  through  monetary  and  fixed-income  research.  Even  with  their  client  buy-side \ninvestors,  they  wish  to  disguise  the  cost  of  their  inventory  of  bonds,  while  buy-side  investors \nwish to know it as a basis for price negotiations with the dealers.   \n\nAn electronic interdealer platform should allow interdealer brokers to play an appropriate role to \norganize  the  OTC  market.  In  a  developing  economy  whose  financial  sector  is  dominated  by \nbanks, the interbank or interdealer market tends to form the core of the overall secondary bond \n\n                                                            \n18 In the Republic of Korea, commercial bond pricing services are provided by rating agencies in a competitive \nmanner. \n19 See the relevant Principles for Financial Benchmarks by the International Organization of Securities Commissions \n(2013).   \n20 Examples include Regulation of Alternative Trading Systems in Europe and the United States. \n\n19 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nmarket  because  banks  predominantly  play  the  role  of  bond  dealer.  An  electronic  trading \nplatform needs to support this market segment. An interdealer platform should allow dealers to \nquote  prices  to  each  other  so  that  they  can  trade  among  themselves  competitively  and  adjust \ntheir bond positions. \n\nDealers need to disguise their identities to their counterparties while controlling their exposures \nin accordance with the counterparty limits they set for each of them. They could do so with the \nhelp of interdealer brokers. If the trading platform provides a functionality to control counterparty \nexposure limits, they could do the same by use of the platform. Some interdealer brokers offer \nsuch  electronic  platforms  and  trading  services.  But  trading  in  such  a  \u201cblind  market\u201d  must  be \nsupported  by  DVP  settlement.  DVP  eliminates  principal  risk,  the  largest  component  of \ncounterparty risk.21 Without it, market participants in a blind market would be exposed to large \ncounterparty  risk  without  knowing  the  identity  and  risk  of  the  counterparty.  When  they  face \nstressful  market  conditions,  market  participants  might  completely  stop  trading  in  the  market \nexcept for in a face-to-face manner with fully trusted counterparties.22 \n\nAs  contractual  savings  and  other  institutional  investors  grow,  it  becomes  important  to  support \nthe  dealer-to-client  segment  of  the  market  with  a  platform.  In  fact,  it  is  generally  desirable  to \nsupport this segment of the market from a relatively early stage. By combining the two market \nsegments (interdealer and dealer-to-client segments), a multi-dealer platform can be developed.  \nIt  should  allow  buy-side  investors  to  request  quotes  from  multiple  dealers  to  compare  and \nchoose  the  best  price  for  execution,  thus  enhancing  transparency,  competitiveness,  and \nefficiency. By capturing a wider market, the market price and volume information should also be \nmore reliable and representative. \n\nA repo market needs to be developed as a special segment of the secondary market. It is a key \ninstrument  for  banks  to  trade  fund  liquidity  while  controlling  counterparty  risks  and  is  critically \nimportant for  promoting bond  market  liquidity.  A well-functioning  repo market  is  a  precondition \nfor  feasible  market  making  by  dealers,  thus  leading  to  the  successful  implementation  of  a  PD \nsystem.  A  master  repurchase  agreement  should  be  adopted  to  standardize  the  repo \ntransactions  in  line  with  international  practices.  The  development  and  adoption  of  a  master \nrepurchase agreement should involve all key participants of a repo market, including both banks \nand securities brokers. \n\nThere  are  different  legal  forms  of  repos,  which  generally  can  be  categorized  into  two  types: \npledged  repos  and  repos  with  title  transfer.  The  former  does  not  allow  repo  buyers  to  reuse \n(rehypothecate)  the  repo  securities  to  obtain  liquidity,  thus  the  efficiency  and  liquidity  of  the \ninstruments  and  the  market  would  be  limited.    It  could  also  create  uncertainty  about  the  repo \nbuyer\u2019s ownership of repo securities in the event of bankruptcy of the repo seller because repo \n\n                                                            \n21 Without DVP, if market stress mounts, market participants could shift to face-to-face trading only with a very \nlimited number of highly qualified counterparties. In a highly stressful situation, the market could completely \ncollapse, making it very difficult for dealers to manage their liquidity \n22 An example includes the Thai Bond Dealers\u2019 Club at the time of the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis. \n\n20 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nsecurities  are  to  be  booked  with  the  seller  under  accounting  rules.  The  latter  type  with  title \ntransfer,  or  so-called  classic  repos,  could  give  the  repo  buyer  greater  security  in  the  event  of \ndefault  or  bankruptcy  of  the  repo  seller.  Most  ASEAN+3  economies  with  a  repo  market  have \nadopted  this  type  of  repo  with  title  transfer.  If  the  title  transfer  allows  rehypothecation,  it \nfacilitates  market  making  by  bond  dealers  and,  therefore,  enhances  the  feasibility  of  a  PD \nsystem. \n\nHowever, rehypothecation could create systemic risk. A clearing and settlement system needs \nto  provide  efficient  clearing  of  repo  transactions  with  effective  management  of  repo  collateral \nand enforcement of margin requirements. Appropriate third parties and/or market infrastructure \nsuch  as  a  central  securities  depository  (CSD)  should  provide  repo  securities  substitution \nservices with appropriate prudential limits if rehypothecation is allowed.   \n\nIt  is  important  to  ensure  that  the  bankruptcy  framework  permits  close-out  netting  of  repo \npositions among repo market participants in the case of default by or bankruptcy of one of the \nparticipants. In countries with a continental civil code legal tradition where a core of accounting \nrules  are  built  into  law,  the  requirement  to  book  repo  securities  with  the  seller  (borrower)  can \ncompromise the right of the repo buyer (lender). It is because the court could rule in favor of the \nseller (borrower) if its bankruptcy is brought to it even if repo agreements give ownership right of \nthe repo securities to the buyer (lender). This possibility is higher if the repo seller is a bank with \nmany  retail  depositors  who  are  senior  creditors  and  are  protected  under  banking  law.    Legal \nauthorities,  the  central  bank,  the  securities  regulator,  and  market  participants  need  to  work \ntogether to address this issue to support the development of a repo market. \n\n(vi) Securities Custody and Settlement Infrastructure \n\nGovernment  securities  trades  involve  frequent  transfers  of  large  values  of  both  money  and \nsecurities  that  can  expose  market  participants  and  investors  to  significant  systemic  risks. \nFrequent high-value transfers could also involve significant time value of money, requiring swift \nsettlement.  Thus,  a  highly  safe  and  efficient  clearing  and  settlement  system  is  required  to \nsupport  the  smooth  operation  of  the  market.  A  C&S  system  needs  to  provide  efficient, \neconomical,  and  convenient  services  for  market  participants  to  reduce  transaction  costs.  It \nshould  provide  fair  access  to  broaden  and  deepen  market  participation  while  controlling  the \ncounterparty risk.   \n\nAs a starting point, government securities should be dematerialized and safe-kept in a central \ncustody system in the form of electronic records. To legally support dematerialization, securities \nlaw  should  recognize  electronic  securities  records  as  evidence  of  securities  ownership, \nregistration, and transfer. On the money leg of the settlement process, the central bank\u2019s money \nshould be used to ensure safe settlement since the central bank is the only plausible entity that \ncan readily provide necessary fund liquidity while withstanding counterparty risk. A C&S system \nmust achieve DVP to eliminate principal risk, the most serious element of counterparty risk. By \nsubstantially  reducing  the  counterparty  risk,  DVP  enables  market  participants  to  enlarge \ncounterparty  exposure  limits,  thus  helping  broaden  the market  and  activate the trading.  Active \n\n21 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nrepo  transactions  or  market  making  are  often  impossible  unless  DVP  is  achieved  in  the  C&S \nprocess.  \n\nAs the market grows, it is necessary to adopt real-time gross settlement (RTGS) for payments \nto achieve Model 1 DVP.23 The central bank needs to either incentivize or require banks to use \nan  RTGS  payment  system  by  providing  intraday  liquidity  support  since  RTGS  requires  a  high \nlevel  of  fund  liquidity.  Securities  custody  and  payments  systems  should  be  interconnected  to \nenable the central bank to automatically collateralize the intraday credit by taking an appropriate \nportion  of  the  bank\u2019s  long  holdings  of  government  bonds  as  collateral.  The  interconnected \nsystems  should  also  be  able  to  rapidly  avail  government  securities  for  market  participants  as \ncollateral  or  margin  assets  to  cover  their  exposures  in  various  financial  instruments  and  to \ncounterparties. 24 Market  participants  also  need  to  pledge  or  repo  government  securities  to \nreadily obtain fund liquidity from the interbank market or the central bank.  \n\nthe  central  custodian  of  government  securities  should  consider  providing \nIn  parallel, \ngovernment  securities  lending  services.  The  central  custodian  safe-keeps  government \nsecurities owned by its participating intermediaries and their client investors. Therefore, it needs \nto  make  an  arrangement  to  systematically  borrow  government  securities  to  create  a  pool  of \ngovernment  securities  out  of  which  it  can  lend.  Such  government  securities  lending  services \nshould  provide  only  very  short-term  lending  services  limited  to  ensuring  sure  and  timely \nsettlement of government securities trades and should not allow long-term speculation. \n\nBecause  of  the  need  to  build  interconnected  systems,  it  is  necessary  to  strategize  the  use  of \ngovernment  securities  in  a  master  plan  for  financial  market  infrastructure  development.  A \nconsensus  should  be  built  on  whether  the  central  bank  or  a  national  CSD  should  safe-keep \ngovernment bonds, considering pros and cons.  The central bank can often offer central custody \nand  core  clearing  services  for  government  securities  at  low  cost.    When  the  central  bank \nprovides such services, however, arrangements should be made to allow market participants as \nuser of the services to govern the provision of the services. The central bank should also accept \nqualified nonbank participants in the government bond market to have money accounts as well \nas  securities  accounts  so  as  not  to  give  banks  unfairly  advantageous  access  to  this  critical \nmarket infrastructure. \n\nThe  C&S  process  involves  a  trade-off  between  safety  and  cost  efficiency.  Net  settlement \nreduces the fund liquidity requirement in comparison to RTGS. However, the netting builds up \ninterdependent trades and, therefore, creates systemic risks. RTGS eliminates systemic risk but \nrequires greater money liquidity supported by the central bank for its operation. An efficient C&S \nsystem  is  one  that  strikes  an  optimal  balance  between  the  liquidity  requirement  and  the \n                                                            \n23 Model 1 DVP refers to payments against the delivery of securities on a transaction-by-transaction basis instead \nof netting. \n24 In trading in various financial instruments, market participants inevitably take positions and are exposed to risks. \nTo manage risk exposure, market participants are required by a clearing house to submit margins in the form of \nhighly creditworthy and liquid assets. Aside from cash, government securities are often accepted to satisfy such \nmargin requirements. \n\n22 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nsystemic  risk,  but  the  optimal  balance  differ  from  one  market  to  another  because  the  trading \nvolume and patterns differ. The market authority and C&S system operator should guide market \nparticipants  to  strike  a  desirable  balance.  Being  concerned  about  systemic  stability  under  its \npolicy mandate, a central bank often provides inexpensive intraday liquidity to entice (or require) \nmarket participants to use RTGS to minimize systemic risk in the government securities trades.  \n\nThe  backbone  of  a  well-functioning  C&S  system  is  operational  efficiency  and  reliability \nsupported  by  a  clear  and  sound  legal  framework  which  is  enforceable  with  a  high  degree  of \ncertainty and speed. The legal framework includes property and insolvency laws as well as laws \nspecific  to  the  operation  of  securities  settlement  systems.  Detailed  operational  rules  and \nregulations need to be provided by the regulatory authority and the C&S system operator in line \nwith the recommendations by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and the \nInternational Organization of Securities Commissions.25  \n\nFor markets aiming to attract large foreign investments in bonds and securities, efficiently linking \nthe  national  CSD  with  an  international  central  securities  depository  (ICSD)  is  important. 26 \nInternational institutional investors prefer to hold securities from different markets in one central \nplace where liquidity from the sale of securities from one country can be readily used to fund the \npurchase  of  those  from  another  country.  In  the  case  of  possible  misconduct  or  wrongdoing, \nhowever, market regulators are unlikely to be able to inspect or investigate an ICSD that does \nnot have a host computer system or database within the domestic jurisdiction. Foreign investors \nmay  not  be  willing  to  directly  invest  in  securities  of  an  emerging  market  economy  whose \ndomestic currency is not fully convertible and therefore cannot be handled by the ICSD because \nforeign  investors  need  to  obtain  convertible  currency  in  the  host  country  market.  Regulatory \nauthorities  and  national  CSDs  of  emerging  market  economies  need  to  consider  these  factors \nbefore establishing linkages with an ICSD. \n\n(vii)  Accounting and Taxation Framework Conductive to Bond Market Development \n\nTaxation of financial transactions, instruments, interest, and capital gains has major impacts on \nthe  financial  market  development.  Poor  tax  policies  can  create  serious  impediments  to  the \nproper  functioning  and  healthy  development  of  the  bond  and  capital  markets.  They  can  also \naffect the saving, investment, and financial behaviors of borrowers, savers, and investors.   \n\nA framework for capital income taxation should, in principle, provide a level playing field for all \nsavings  and  investment  instruments,  including  government  bonds.27 An  examination  of  the  tax \nframework  needs  to  take  into  account  impacts  of  not  only  taxes  on  specific  forms  of  capital \nincome such as interest income, dividends, and capital gains, but also the underlying personal \nand  corporate  income tax  framework.  Any tax  incentives  should  be  carefully  considered so  as \n                                                            \n25 Principles for Financial Market Infrastructure, Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and \nInternational Organization of Securities Commissions (2013).  \n26 Examples include Euroclear and Clearstream. \n27 Mervyn A. King and Don Fullerton. 1983. The Taxation of Income from Capital: A Comparative Study of the US, \nUK, Sweden, and West Germany\u2013The Theoretical Framework.  \n\n23 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nnot to create distortions, gaps, or loopholes, and to avoid unintended tax incidence caused by \nprice elasticity of demand and supply of capital.   \n\nTax administration should be clearly understandable, practical, and enforceable. A transactions \ntax is often adopted in place of an income tax for ease of tax collection and administration. But it \nneeds  to  avoid  inadvertently  impeding  the  trading  of  government  bonds,  particularly  repo \ntransactions.  Tax  treatment  of  foreign  investors  and  applications  under  tax  treaties  should  be \nclear  and  understandable.  The  use  of  withholding  tax  for  ease  of  tax  collection  and \nadministration should avoid creating complications or uncertainty in the tax treatment of foreign \ninvestors. \n\nTax exemption for certain investors or instruments are found in many countries. Pension funds \nare usually exempted from a tax on their investment incomes. Local government bonds in some \ncountries  are  tax  exempt.  These  arrangements  necessitate  close  monitoring  of  the  proper \napplication of tax exemptions and increase administrative costs. They also tend to fragment the \nbond  market  between  taxable  and  tax-exempt  investors,  complicate  the  pricing  of  instruments \nand thus compromising market efficiency.  \n\nAccounting  rules  for  fixed-income  instruments  should  be  clear  with  respect  to  those  held  to \nmaturity and those available for trade. Fair value accounting (mark-to-market or mark-to-model) \nof  fixed-income  portfolios  encourages  institutional  investors  and  banks  to  trade  bonds  actively \nwhile  facilitating  the  management  of  interest  rate  risk.  However,  the  implementation  of \nInternational  Financial  Reporting  Standard  928 is  challenging  in  many  emerging  markets  that \nlack liquidity and, therefore, price transparency.   \n\nV. \n\nNature of the Task: Sequencing, Mapping, and Institutional Arrangements \n\nThe building blocks discussed in section IV identify common elements in the challenges of bond \nmarket  development  across  countries.  However,  markets  with  different  levels  of  development \nface different challenges at different times within and across these building blocks.   \n\nChallenges  in  addressing  the  issues  and  implementing  the  reform  measures  identified  above \ntend  to  arise  from  two  angles.  First,  many  reform  measures  are  interdependent  in  varying \ndegrees because a bond market is not a single institution but a place of interaction. No single \nparty,  including  the  government,  can  dictate  this  development  process,  and  all  stakeholders \nmust  play  their  part.  A  successful  implementation  strategy  must  identify  critical  paths  and \nappropriate sequencing to achieve an optimal result. Market and economic circumstances can \nchange  over  time,  sometimes  quickly.  Thus,  there  should  be  continuous  consultation  among \nstakeholders to ensure the most effective implementation.  \n\nThe  second  challenge  stems  from  the  fact  that  this  effort  requires  cooperation  among \nstakeholders  and  market  participants  whose  interests  often  conflict.  They  must  be  brought \n\n                                                            \n28 IFRS 9 promulgated by the International Accounting Standard Board addresses fair value accounting for financial \ninstruments. \n\n24 \n\n\f \n\n \n\ntogether  to  achieve  the  ultimate  common  goal  of  bond  market  development.  This  requires \nstrong  leadership from  policy  making  authorities,  particularly  the finance ministry  as the  issuer \nand the central bank as the key market operator. Securities and contractual savings authorities \nalso  need  to  play  important  roles.  Market  operators\u2014such  as  exchanges,  CSDs,  and  clearing \nhouses\u2014and participants should also actively play their parts. \n\nMany  countries  that  have  successfully  developed  an  LCY  bond  market  adopted  a  high-level \ninteragency bond market committee, led by the finance ministry and the central bank, to guide \nand coordinate the implementation of interdependent tasks. Some countries faced difficulties in \nforming  an  interagency  committee  due  to  different  structures  of  the  government  and/or  the \nstatus  of  the  central  bank  in  relation  with  the  government.  It  is  highly  preferable  for  both  the \nfinance  ministry  and  the  central  bank  to  exercise  leadership  roles  even  if  one  (usually  the \nfinance ministry) takes on primary responsibility, or if they cannot officially form an interagency \ncommittee. Experiences show that the lack of either party playing a leading role in the effort is \nlikely to result in limited outcomes.   \n\nInteragency committees should develop a roadmap by identifying priority reforms in the building \nblocks  and  examining  interdependence  among them. They  should  also develop  more  detailed \naction plans along the roadmap to guide and coordinate the implementation. It can then assign \nan  appropriate  member(s)  of  the  committee  to  lead  each  task  and  ensure  that  feedback  from \nthe task teams is communicated to the committee for review and guidance. Committees need to \nmonitor  implementation progress  and  periodically  review  the  action  plan  (and the roadmap) to \nensure the relevance of actions and the effectiveness of coordination. \n\nIn prioritizing actions, studies should be conducted immediately as they facilitate identification of \nspecific  interdependencies  among  tasks  and  actions.  The  studies  should  also  identify  actions \nrequiring legislation. Preparation for such actions should be initiated as soon as possible since \nlegislation often takes time. A comprehensive study of the tax framework is recommended at an \nearly  stage  because  rational  taxation  is  a  key  prerequisite  for  building  a  liquid  and  efficient \nsecondary  market.  Tax  reform  also  tends  to  take  time  if  legislation  and/or  strict  tax  revenue \nneutrality  is  required.  Tax  reform  measures  are  generally  not  pre-conditioned  upon  prior  or \nsimultaneous  implementation  of  other  reform  measures.  This  effort  should  be  led  by  the  tax \nauthority and the securities regulator.  \n\nBeyond studies and tax reform, efforts to enhance the public debt management framework and \nprimary market reform should generally precede actions to boost the secondary market. This is \nbecause  poor  debt  management  or  an  uncompetitive  primary  market  often  leads  to \nfragmentation  or  distortions  that  make  it  difficult  to  trade  bonds  in  the  secondary  market. \nHowever,  this  does  not  mean  that  all  actions  and  reform  measures  to  enhance  debt \nmanagement  and  the  primary  market  must  be  completed  before  any  actions  to  improve  the \nsecondary  market  can  be  taken  effectively.  In  fact,  there  are  significant  interdependencies \nbetween the primary and secondary markets.  \n\nMultiple  task  teams  can  be  formed  under  the  interagency  committee.  The  committee  can \nidentify tasks and guide the formation of task teams. Each task team should formulate a detailed \n25 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\naction plan for its specific task and such plans should be aggregated to become the committee\u2019s \nmaster action plan. The master action plan should be publicly announced through the websites \nof the finance ministry, the central bank, and other members of the interagency committee, and \nupdated periodically as needed.   \n\nUpdating of the master action plan will be necessary because of uncertainties and unanticipated \nfactors.  For  example,  certain  key  policy  measures  may  not  be  implemented  without  related \nlegislation by the parliament or the government. Market development tends to be opportunistic, \nwhich  makes  the  actions  under  the  master  plan  moving  targets  to  some  extent.  Conflicts  of \ninterest among various stakeholders can also cause delays in implementation of some reforms. \nThus,  the  proposed  updating  and  public  announcement  mechanism  will  be  useful  in  keeping \nmarket participants informed of future actions and maintaining strong reform momentum.  \n\nTask  team  leaders  should  be  identified  on  the  basis  of  the  (i)  relevance  of  the  tasks  to  the \nauthority  and  the  areas  of  competency  of  potential  leader  institution,  and  (ii)  absence  of  a \npotential leader institution\u2019s vested interest in the task. The former may be obvious but the latter \nshould be carefully considered, particularly when a private sector institution needs to be a task \nleader.  In  addition,  legal  experts may  also  be  invited from  various  authorities  and  the financial \nsector to participate in these task teams. For example, the involvement of experts from the legal \ndepartment  of  the  central  bank,  the  securities  regulator,  and/or  the  insurance  regulator  will  be \nindispensable when task implementation precipitates legislative changes.  \n\nThe scope of responsibilities of the committee may be revisited over time so that the committee \ncan  revise  the  scope  of  its  responsibilities  after  achieving  its  original  objectives  of  developing \nthe  government  bond  market.  A  typical  and  natural  step  after  achieving  these  objectives  is  to \nshift  focus  to  the  corporate  bond  market.  It  is  often  useful  and/or  necessary  because  state-\nowned  enterprises  and major financial  institutions  can  play  leading  roles  as key  issuers  in the \ncorporate bond market. They can create implications on contingent liabilities of the government.   \n\nVI. \n\nCountry Cases\u2014Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Viet Nam \n\nThis section first  discusses  the  cases  of Thailand  and Indonesia that  were  successively  hit  by \nthe  Asian  financial  crisis  of  1997/98,  which  led  them  to  make  concerted  efforts  to  build  their \nmarkets \n\n26 \n\n\fSize of Thailand's LCY Bond Market\n(denominated in Thai Baht)\n\nThailand \n\n12000\n\n10000\n\n8000\n\n6000\n\n4000\n\n2000\n\n0\n\n \n\n \n\n5\n9\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n5\n9\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n6\n9\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n6\n9\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n7\n9\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n7\n9\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n8\n9\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n8\n9\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n9\n9\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n9\n9\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n0\n0\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n0\n0\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n1\n0\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n1\n0\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n2\n0\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n2\n0\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n3\n0\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n3\n0\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n4\n0\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n4\n0\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n5\n0\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n5\n0\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n6\n0\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n6\n0\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n7\n0\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n7\n0\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n8\n0\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n8\n0\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n9\n0\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n9\n0\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n0\n1\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n0\n1\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n1\n1\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n1\n1\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n2\n1\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n2\n1\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n3\n1\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n3\n1\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n4\n1\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n4\n1\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n5\n1\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n5\n1\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n6\n1\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n6\n1\n-\np\ne\nS\n\nGovernment Bond\n\nCorporate Bond\n\n \n\nSource: AsianBondsOnline. \n\nThe 1997/98 Asian financial crisis forced Thailand to let the baht float, which led to more than a \n50% depreciation of the currency. The depreciation brought down many businesses with foreign \nexchange exposures, causing massive losses to banks and finance companies. To finance the \nlosses  and  ensure  the  systemic  stability  of  the  banking  and  financial  system,  the  Ministry  of \nFinance  (MOF)  issued  an  unprecedented  amount  of  government  bonds  and  government-\nguaranteed bonds.29   \n\nGovernment bonds issued in 1998\u20131999 amounted to THB500 billion, or the equivalent of 10% \nof gross domestic product at that time. Since the domestic bond market had not been developed \nyet,  Thailand\u2019s  financial  system  relied  on  commercial  bank  loans.  The  Financial  Institution \nDevelopment  Fund,  which  is  housed  in  the  Bank  of  Thailand  (BOT),  stepped  in  to  absorb  the \nlosses.   \n\nThe  MOF  examined  how  to  develop  the  bond  market  as  an  alternative  funding  source  by \nestablishing the Domestic Bond Market Development Committee to encourage stakeholders in \nthe  public  and  private  sectors  to  participate  in  the  formulation  of  a  domestic  bond  market \nstrategy.  The committee comprised representatives of the BOT; MOF; Securities and Exchange \nCommission,  Thailand  (SEC);  Thai  Bond  Dealing  Center;  and  commercial  banks.    The \ncommittee established eight task forces to resolve problems in their respective areas. The MOF \nworked intensively to develop legislation for the establishment of the Public Debt Management \nOffice in 1999. Figure 2 below shows the structure of the committee and its relevant task forces. \n\n                                                            \n29 Government-guaranteed bonds included Financial Institutions Development Fund bonds. \n\n27 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Public Debt Management Office.  \n\nThe MOF developed its first Domestic Bond Market Development Plan, 2000\u20132004, resulting in \na notable change in terms of bond types, market infrastructure, and operation of the market for \ndebt  instruments.30 Significant  changes  were  observed,  including  publication  of  an  issuance \nschedule and establishment of the secondary market\u2019s interest rate yield curve that has served \nas a benchmark for maturities of up to 20 years. A DVP system was also introduced and RTGS \nwas  implemented  through  the  BOT\u2019s  BAHTNET  system.  Other  relevant  reforms  included  the \nintroduction of a PD system and private repo markets. \n\nFollowing  the  implementation  of  the  second  Domestic  Bond  Market  Development  Plan,  2005\u2013\n2014,  the  Domestic  Bond  Market  Development  Steering  Committee  was  established.  It  is \nchaired by the minister of finance and solicits the participation of the BOT Governor; Secretary\u2013\nGeneral  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  of  Thailand;  President  of  the  Stock \nExchange  of  Thailand  (SET),  President  of  the  Thai  Bond  Market  Association  (ThaiBMA);  and \nkey market participants.   \n\nFive  subcommittees  were  also  established:  (i)  Primary  Market  Development,  (ii)  Secondary \nMarket  Development,  (iii)  Bond  Market  Infrastructure,  (iv)  Taxation,  and  (v)  Information \nTechnology  and  Human  Resources  Development.  As  implementation  has  progressed,  the \ncommittee reviewed and updated the roadmap and addressed new challenges.

To promote liquidity in secondary market, the BOT established the bond lending \nunit  and  the  collateral  management  unit  to  maintain  market  participants\u2019  confidence  in  short-\nsales  transactions.  The  BOT  also  upgraded  the  BAHTNET  payments  system  to  BAHTNET  II, \nwhich  could  support  both  large  value  interbank  payments  in  RTGS  and  the  registration  and \ntransfer  of government  securities.  As  a  large  volume  of government  bonds  were  introduced  to \nthe market, the BOT guided banks to use RTGS capable BAHTNET II to reduce systemic risk \nas  the  trading  volume  accelerated.  Subsequently,  the  custody  function  for  government  bonds \nwas transferred to the Thailand Securities Depository Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the \nStock  Exchange  of  Thailand,  while  the  BOT\u2019s  BAHTNET  system  was  still  made  available  to \ninvestors.   \n\nThe  Thai  Bond  Dealing  Center,  which  operated  an  electronic  bond  trading  system,  was \nreformed  to  be  the  Thailand  Bond  Market  Association  (ThaiBMA)  in  September  2005  and \nformally recognized as an SRO by the SEC. Since then, ThaiBMA has assumed responsibility \nfor market monitoring and surveillance to ensure compliance with relevant regulations, fairness, \nand  efficiency.  It  has  played  important  roles  in  establishing  ethics  and  code  of  conduct, \ndeveloping  market  convention  and  standards,  and  becoming  the  bond  information  center  and \nbond  pricing  agency.  Members  of  ThaiBMA  include  banks  and  securities  firms  that  have \nsecurities dealing license granted by SEC.  \n\nIn  2006,  the  Steering  Committee  determined  that  trading  system  should  be  centered  at  the \nStock Exchange of Thailand while ThaiBMA would focus on its functions as an SRO and bond \ninformation center.   \n\nAs  the  government  bond  market  was  further  established,  the  Steering  Committee  revised  its \nroadmap  to  focus  increasingly  on  the  corporate  bond  market.  Consequently,  the  SEC  began \ntaking a more central role in promoting the corporate bond market.   \n\n29 \n\n\fIndonesia \n\n2500000\n\n2000000\n\n1500000\n\n1000000\n\n500000\n\n0\n\n \n\n \n\nSize of Indonesia's LCY Bond Market\n(denominated in Indonesian Rupiah)\n\nGovernment (in LCY Billions)\n\nCorporate (in LCY Billions)\n\n \n\nSource: AsianBondsOnline. \n\nIndonesia took a more authority-led approach in response to the severe losses in the banking \nsector  during  the  1997/98  Asian  financial  crisis.  Several  financial  institutions  were  closed  or \ntaken over by the government as a precondition for getting a financial assistance package from \nthe International Monetary Fund. The first government bond was issued in 1999 as payment for \nthe  shares  bought  by  the  government  to  ailing  banks,  which  were  known  as  recapitalization \n(recap)  bonds.  The  recap  bonds  began  trading  on  the  secondary  market  in  2000  and  grew \nsignificantly from IDR32 trillion in 2000 to around IDR712 trillion in 2011. The financial crisis also \nlet to the establishment of Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency in 1998, which was mandated \nto  segregate  bad  assets  and  recapitalize  viable  banks.  Government  bonds  were  issued  and \ndirectly placed to Bank Indonesia for the purpose of financing the recapitalization of banks. Most \nof these bonds were nontradable and index-linked. \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  established  a  debt  management  unit  in  2001  with  responsibility  for \nmanaging the government bond portfolio. In 2002, the government securities law was issued as \nthe basis for a legal framework for the issuance of government securities. \n\nTo  further  enhance  the  development  of  the  government  bond  market  and  serve  the \ngovernment\u2019s  decentralization  program, \nthe  Law  on  Fiscal  Balance  Between  Central \nGovernment  and  Regional  Government  was  enacted  in  2004  (Law  33/2004). The  law  allowed \nlocal  governments  to  borrow  from  the  public  by  issuing  local  government  bonds  (municipal \nbonds). The central government does not guarantee local government bonds so as to promote \nmarket-based financing. \n\nTo  manage  all  government  debt,  including  foreign  loans,  and  to  develop  Islamic  finance \ninstruments, the debt management unit was transformed into a debt management office in 2006 \n\n30 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nby  merging  the  Directorate  of  External  Funds  and  Directorate  of  Government  Bonds \nManagement.  In  2011,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  entered  into  a  memorandum  of  understanding \nwith the Ministry of State Owned Enterprises requiring state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to act as \nstand-by  purchasers  of  government  bonds  in  the  event  of  sudden  capital  outflows.  Under  the \nscheme,  a  bond  stabilization  framework  was  created  to  help  protect  the  economy  in  case  of \nsudden capital flight. \n\nIn accordance with the mandate of Act No.21 of the Financial Services Authority, 2011, Otoritas \nJasa Keuangan  (OJK) was established as the single regulatory authority for financial and capital \nmarkets in Indonesia, effective 31 December 2012. As of 1 January 2013, OJK effectively took \nover  the  remit  of  the  previous  Capital  Market  and  Financial  Institutions  Supervisory  Agency \n(BAPEPAM-LK) for capital markets and of the Ministry of Finance for nonbank financial industry \nsupervision.  The  functions  of  banking  supervision  and  regulation  effectively  transferred  from \nBank  Indonesia  to  OJK  on  1  January  2014.  Responding  to  its  mandate  for  the  integrated \nregulation and supervision of the financial sector, including the bond market, OJK established in \n2014  a  national  team  for  bond  market  development  that  consists  of  OJK  as  chair  plus  Bank \nIndonesia,  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  SROs  such  as  the  Indonesian  Stock  Exchange  and \nIndonesia  Bond  Pricing  Agency.  The  team  focuses  not  only  on  government  bond  market \ndevelopment, but also on the corporate bond. It has facilitated regulators in formulating policies \nand coordinating, while addressing cross-cutting issues to increase liquidity in the bond market \n(e.g., taxation issues). Some of the main recommendations that have been executed include the \nestablishment of a Bond Index in 2014 and a Global Master Repurchase Agreement in 2016. \n\nGiven Indonesia\u2019s early stage of bond market development, OJK issued a regulation in January \n2016  (No.1/POJK.05/2016)  requiring  institutional  investors  such  as  pension  and  insurance \nfunds to invest in government bonds. The regulation was subsequently revised to also include \nbonds issued by SOEs and their subsidiaries. It is expected that the investment obligations will \ncatalyze  the  bond  market  by  familiarizing  institutional  investors  with  government  bonds.  The \nurgency  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the  majority  of  institutional  investor  assets,  which  should  be \nnatural  buyers  of  long-term  assets  such  as  bonds,  are  heavily  focused  on  short-term \ninstruments, indicating a mismatch in the financial sector.  \n\nSince the Government of Indonesia issued foreign-currency-denominated government securities \nfor the first time in 2004, all payments of principal and interest for both conventional and Islamic \nforeign-currency-denominated government bonds are made free and clear of withholding taxes. \nThis policy is stipulated in the Budget Law and followed by Ministry of Finance regulations every \nyear.  For  fiscal  year  2016,  the  regulation  was  published  in  June  2016  with  effectiveness  from \nJanuary to December 2016. \n\n31 \n\n\fMalaysia \n\n1400\n\n1200\n\n1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n \n\n \n\nSize of Malaysia's LCY Bond Market\n(denominated in Malaysian Ringgit)\n\nGovernment (in LCY Billions)\n\nCorporate (in LCY Billions)\n\n \n\nSource: AsianBondsOnline. \n\nThe Malaysian bond market has a relatively long history dating back to the pre-crisis era. It has \ndeveloped on a step-by-step basis over time, attaining a level of depth and diversity exceeding \nthat of most other bond markets in the region.   \n\nThe development dates to the 1960s and 1970s when the first Malaysia Government Securities \n(MGS)  was  issued  to  meet  the  investment  needs  of  the  Employees\u2019  Provident  Fund  (EPF), \nbanks,  and  insurance  companies.  The  EPF,  an  agency  under  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  was \ninitially  required  to  invest  at  least  50%  of  its  funds  in  any  1  year  in  MGS.  The  Government  of \nMalaysia issued MGS to finance public sector investment during the 1970s and early 1980s. In \nthe late 1980s, MGS were used to finance deficits and repay some of the government\u2019s external \nloans.31 Since then, the issuance of MGS has slowed partly due to a reduction in the borrowing \nprogram as well as the government\u2019s initiative to promote private-sector led investments.32 As a \nresult,  the  development  of  debt  securities  in  Malaysia  has  been  largely  achieved  through  the \ngrowth of corporate bonds. \n\nA  PD  system  was  implemented  by  Bank  Negara  Malaysia  (BNM)  in  1989  to  promote  the \ndevelopment the primary and secondary markets. PDs were given privileges such as accepting \nrepos of less than 1 month from non-interbank customers. However, this privilege was removed \nand  replaced  with  the  privilege  of  participating  as  both  borrower  and  lender  in  the  newly \nlaunched  Securities  Borrowing  and  Lending  Program  under  Real-Time  and  Gross  Settlement \nSystem  (RENTAS)  and  allowed  to  participate  in  repo  and  reverse  repo  transactions  for  the \npurpose of hedging activities. \n\n                                                            \n31 The development of debt markets in Malaysia by Dato\u2019 Salleh Harun \n32 ibid \n\n32 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn 1999, the Government of Malaysia established the National Bond Market Committee (NBMC) \nto  provide  policy  direction  and  coordinate  a  regulatory  framework  for  the  development  of  the \nMalaysian bond market.  The NBMC was chaired by Secretary General of Treasury, Ministry of \nFinance  and  comprised  senior  representatives  from  BNM,  the  Securities  Commission, \nEconomic Planning Unit, Companies Commission of Malaysia, and Bursa Malaysia. One of the \nkey  recommendations  of  the  NBMC  was  the  introduction  of  program  issuance  of  MGS.  The \npurpose  of  regular  and  frequent  issuance  of  MGS  was  to  allow  the  market  to  use  MGS  as  a \nbenchmark and to develop a yield curve. The schedule of MGS auctions began in March 2000.   \nThe NBMC also suggested the prescribed percentage for the EPF to invest in MGS be reduced \nto  30%  because  the  issuance  of  MGS  was  insufficient  to  meet  the  EPF\u2019s  investment  needs, \nwhich  has  greatly  distorted  bond  market  liquidity  and  the  development  of  the  Malaysian  bond \nmarket. \n\nIn 2006, BNM launched Bond Info Hub, a one-stop center detailing all bond-related information \nin Malaysia. Bond Info Hub is the primary source of information on the Malaysian bond market \nfor  the  global  investment  community.  In  addition  to  being  a  key  initiative  to  promote  the \ndomestic  bond  market,  Bond  Info  Hub  acts  as  a  conduit  to  correct  misconceptions,  especially \namong foreign investors, about the state of market development in Malaysia. Also in 2006, the \nSC  issued  Guidelines  on  the  Registration  of  Bond  Pricing  Agencies  to  complement  the \ngovernment's  objective  of  building  more  efficient  and  liquid  conventional  bond  and  sukuk \n(Islamic bond) markets.   \n\nIn  2013,  Bursa  Malaysia  Securities  introduced  the  rules  to  facilitate  Exchange-Traded  Bonds \nand  Sukuk  to  be  listed  and  traded  on  Bursa  Securities  to  provide  access  to  wider  group  of \ninvestors.

By the mid-2000s, the Ministry of Finance recognized the \nneed  to  develop  a  bond  market,  starting  with  the  government  bond  market,  because  it \nanticipated the graduation from concessional resources of multilateral development banks and \nbilateral donors in the foreseeable future. It saw a need to diversify funding sources and reduce \nthe  reliance  on  foreign  currency  finances  and  risks  associated  with  them.  As  a  result,  the \nVietnamese  bond  market  is  mainly  dominated  by  government  bonds,  while  commercial  banks \nare the largest investor group in the bond market. \n\nThe Government of Viet Nam issued the first US dollar bond in the international market in 2005.  \nIn  parallel,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  started  regularly  issuing  domestic  government  bonds  while \nconsolidating  domestic  and  external  debt  management  functions  to  create  a  comprehensive \npublic debt management capacity. It also started regularly publishing an issuance calendar and \npublic debt statistics. The growing availability of LCY government bonds facilitated mobilization \nof LCY deposits by banks and de-dollarization of the economy. \n\nTo support the government\u2019s attempt to reform Vietnam\u2019s financial markets, the Vietnam Bond \nMarket  Forum  was  formed  in  November  2006  to  promote  bond  market  liquidity  through \ndissemination  of  market  information  and  standardization  of  commercial  activities  among  local \nand  international  commercial  banks,  securities  companies,  fund  management  companies,  and \ninsurance  companies.  The  Vietnam  Bond  Market  Forum  was  later  transformed  into  the  Viet \nNam Bond Market Association in 2009 following the approval by the Ministry of Interior.  \n\n34 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nIn  2009,  Hanoi  Stock  Exchange  was  designated  as  the  central  trading  venue  of  domestic \ngovernment  bonds  with  around  30  market  participants,  including  major commercial  banks  and \nsecurities  companies.    In  2013,  Hanoi  Stock  Exchange  started  publishing  a  benchmark  yield \ncurve.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  developed  and  issued  a  roadmap  in  February  2013  and \nannounced its intention to expand the bond market to 38% of gross domestic product by 2020.  \nDue to the institutional nature of its government, however, the Ministry of Finance could not form \nan  inter-agency  committee  with  the  State  Bank  of  Vietnam.  Instead,  the  ministry\u2019s  roadmap \nassigned its various responsible departments and the State Securities Commission to work with \nthe central bank and other stakeholders in carrying out their respective tasks. \n\nIn  2013,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  issued  the  first  comprehensive  strategy  for  bond  market \ndevelopment  covering  both  government  and  corporate  bonds.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  government  bond \nmarket  is  now  taking  a  critical  step  to  move  the  money  side  of  bond  trade  settlement  from  a \ncommercial bank to the central bank in accordance with international standards. \n\nViet  Nam  expects  to  fully  graduate  from  World  Bank  IDA  and  be  classified  as  an  IBRD  Only \nCountry in 2017, and to graduate from ADB\u2019s ADF and be classified as an OCR Only Country in \n2019. The Government of Viet Nam is now reviewing a possible revision of its strategy to take \ndomestic bond market development to the next stage.   \n\nVI. \n\nLinks with Subnational and Corporate Bond Markets \n\nLCY  government  bonds  function  as  benchmarks  in  pricing  most  other  bonds  and  debt \ninstruments.  This  role  is  particularly  important  in  pricing  subnational  (local  government)  and \nSOE bonds, which are important instruments in financing infrastructure. Fiscal decentralization \nto strengthen the revenue sources of local governments is a foundation for the development of \nsubnational bond markets. They are seen as guaranteed, implicitly or explicitly, by the national \ngovernment.  As  such,  it  is  essential  to  build  a  sound  framework  and  capacity  for  contingent \nliabilities  management.  The  public  debt  management  framework  of  the  national  government \nmust capture subnational bonds in its radar and exercise appropriate control over them.  At the \nsame  time,  local  governments  should  be  subjected  to  appropriate  market  disciplines  including \ncredit rating.    \n\nBonds  issued  by  SOEs  are  subsovereign  bonds.  They  sit  in-between  subnational  bonds  and \ncorporate  bonds.  In  most  bond  markets  around  the  world,  the  corporate  bond  market  is \ndominated  by  utilities  or  other  infrastructure  businesses,  financial  institutions,  and  property \ndevelopers.  Of those, many utilities and infrastructure businesses are partly or wholly owned by \nthe  government.  To  the  extent  that  their  bonds  are  guaranteed,  implicitly  or  explicitly,  by  the \ngovernment, they should be captured by the contingent liabilities management framework.   \n\nUnlike  government  bonds,  however,  corporate  bonds,  including  SOE  bonds,  bear  varying \ndegrees  of  credit  risk.  The  demand  for  them  is  influenced  significantly  by  prudential  rules  for \nbanks and insurance companies as investors. Unlike government bonds, corporate bonds tend \nto  compete  with  bank  loans  in financing  businesses.  As  such,  the  development  of a  corporate \nbond market is influenced significantly by its competitive relationships with the banking system \n\n35 \n\n\f \n\n \n\neven though corporate bonds are supported by custody, payments, and other services of banks. \nBecause  both  subnational  and  corporate  bond  markets  are  by  nature  fragmented  (comprising \nmany issuers with many different instruments), they tend to be too illiquid to justify adoption of a \ndedicated  trading  platform.  They  could  instead  benefit  from  a  platform  designed  to  trade \ngovernment  bonds  with  additional  functions.  As  in  the  case  of  interconnected  or  integrated \nsettlement  infrastructure  above,  it  is  useful  to  strategize  the  use  of  government  bond  trading \nplatforms in a master plan for financial market infrastructure development. The illiquidity of these \ninstruments  also  calls  for  arrangements  to  promote  their  price  transparency.  Indonesia, \nMalaysia,  and  Thailand  have  established  central  bond  pricing  agencies,  while  the  Republic  of \nKorea  took  a  more  private-sector-led  approach  that  promotes  price  transparency  through \ncompetition. \n\nSubnational and corporate bond market development involves a different set of challenges than \nthose  associated  with  the  government  bond  market.  Therefore,  authorities  and  other \nstakeholders  need  to  assume  different  roles  in  leading  the  effort.  In  particular,  the  securities \nregulatory authorities need to assume greater responsibility in leading it. \n\nVII. \n\nConclusion \n\nIn response to the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis, ASEAN+3 members agreed to launch ABMI in \n2002, with its activities starting in 2003. ADB was appointed as the secretariat. It was only when \nthe most urgent fire-fighting exercise of crisis management had been completed that authorities \nstarted  focusing  more  on  long-term  bond  market  development  issues.  Involving  a  mix  of  low-, \nmiddle-, and high-income economies, ABMI has been developed and implemented around the \ntwin  pillars  of  market  development  and  market  integration.  Middle-income  ASEAN  members \nparticipate  in  both.  Viet  Nam  joined  this  group  in  2000  as  it  made  progress  in  developing  its \ngovernment  bond  market.  The  PRC,  Japan,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  and  Singapore  and  are \nactive  on  market  integration  initiatives.  The  CLM  countries  now  need  to  start  tackling  this \nchallenge. \n\nThe  initiative  of  the  Technical  Assistance  Coordination  Teams,  funded  by  the  Government  of \nJapan, provides support for the CLMV countries as well as other interested ASEAN members.33  \nViet Nam has taken advantage of this support to build-up its government bond market. In order \nfor all of the CLM countries to fully benefit from this assistance, it is vital that their governments \nready  themselves for the  challenges  ahead.  As they  begin  the  process of graduating from  the \nconcessional resources of the multilateral development banks, they stand at a critical juncture. \n\nThe time is now ripe for LCY bond market development in the CLM countries. Good practices \nand  models  are  available  within  the  region.  Each  country  will  need  to  create  an  institutional \nstructure  to  guide  the  concerted  efforts  of  multiple  stakeholders  and  to  develop  their  own \nroadmaps  based  on  a  thorough  assessment  of  their  specific  market  conditions.  ADB  stands \nready to assist these important endeavors.   \n\n                                                            \n33 To date, this includes Indonesia and the Philippines. \n\n36 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nReferences \n\nAsian Development Bank (ADB). 2012.
