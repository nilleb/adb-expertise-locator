In particular, mention should be made of\nMs.  Kathleen  Moktan,  Director,  Capacity  Development  and  Governance\nDivision in the Regional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD).\nIt would be pertinent to note the contributions of Mr. Jak Jabes, the former\nDirector, Capacity Development and Governance Division who oversaw the\nbirth of this network and its nurturing until October 2005; Ms. Eden Santiago,\nwho ably managed the secretariat functions at ADB until early 2006; and the\nofficials of the China School of National Administration, led by Dr. Yuan\nShuhong who made exceptional arrangements in Beijing for the success of\nthis 2005 conference. Thanks are also due to Ms. Asha Newsum, former ADB\nstaff for her inputs during the conference, and to Dr. Claudia Buentjen, Senior\nCapacity Development Specialist, ADB, for her useful advice on the role of\nnetworks in fostering capacity development.\n\nThe  assistance  of  workshop  conveners  and  NAPSIPAG  steering\ncommittee members comprising Dr. R.K. Mishra of the Institute of Public\nEnterprise, Osmania University, Hyderabad, as well as Dr. Alex Brillantes,\nand Dr. Joel Mangahas of the National College of Public Administration and\nGovernance, University of the Philippines, must be acknowledged for carefully\nundertaking  the  first  round  of  selecting  the  papers.  Due  to  constraints  of\nspace and to maintain thematic harmony and maximum regional participation,\nwe could not include all the papers submitted at the 2005 conference. However,\nwe wish to extend our profound gratitude to the academicians and practitioners\nfrom  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region,  who  provided  invaluable  contributions\nthrough their research papers and made the Annual Conference a success.\nThe exclusion of several papers is by no means a comment on the quality of\nthe papers that could not be included in this volume.\n\nFinally,  the  National  Institute  of  Public  Administration  (INTAN),\nMalaysia and its Director, Dr. Hj. Malek Shah Bin Hj. Mohd Yusoff and Dr.\nMohd Gazali Abas, Executive Director, NAPSIPAG must be profusely thanked\nfor their valuable advice and support. A large measure of NAPSIPAG\u2019s success\nis attributable to the leadership and human resources that INTAN has provided\nover the past year while managing the network\u2019s secretariat.\n\nWe would like to thank Mary Ann Asico and Aldwin Sutarez (from the\nADB\u2019s RSDD-Knowledge Management Center) for competently copyediting\nand  managing  the  logistics  of  publishing  this  volume,  respectively.  ADB\u2019s\nDepartment of External Relations provided continued support and advice in\nputting this volume together and steering it to the publishing stage.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\fIntroduction\n\nix\n\nIntroduction\n\nGlobalization and the advancements in information and communication\ntechnology  (ICT)  during  the  1980s  and  1990s  facilitated  the  growth  in\nknowledge  or  learning  networks.1  These  networks  have  significantly\ncontributed  in  creating  and  expanding  knowledge-based  economies  and\nsocieties2 wherein performance culture and higher productivity are maintained\nthrough continuous build up, diffusion, and utilization of information and\nknowledge.\n\nLearning  or  knowledge  networks  are  increasingly  referred  to  in  the\ninnovation literature as \u201csoft infrastructure\u201d required to support innovation\nsystems  as  opposed  to  \u201chard  infrastructure\u201d  of  traditional  organizations/\nenterprises.3 Effective networks bring about faster development of new ideas,\nproducts, and services and better optimization of research and development\ninvestment. They also maximize the knowledge potential of an organization/\nenterprise as well as its responsiveness and adaptability.\n\nFurther, knowledge networks provide development practitioners with\naccess to cutting-edge advice and information in their respective fields and\nacross sectors and disciplines. Typically these networks are established as a\nresult of, or lead up to, a learning program or event although they can stand\nalone. Through the aid of information and communication technology, they\nbring together communities of practice in a wide range of subjects providing\nelectronic discussions and websites to encourage research and disseminate best\npractices and lessons learned. 4\n\nThe success of knowledge networks depends on their development into\na space for innovation, experimentation, and learning. These networks can\nboost the knowledge base, learning processes, and civil society actors\u2019 capacity\nto  generate  and  advocate  proposals.  Development  practitioners  claim  that\ncapacity development, institution building, advocacy, and societal change are\nunthinkable without considerable investment in improving networking and\nlearning among relevant development actors. This is why development agencies\ninvest in networking among their partners to enable civil society both globally\nand  locally  to  play  a  strong  role  in  shaping  the  ideas  and  knowledge  that\ndetermine  our  future.5    In  line  with  this  thrust  on  networking,  the  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  supported  the  creation  of  a  regional  network\nfocusing on cross-learning and knowledge sharing. We elaborate on this in\nthe following section.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\fx\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nEmergence of NAPSIPAG\n\nRecognizing  the  potential  of  schools  and  institutes  of  public\nadministration  as  potentially  powerful  advisory  resource  to  strengthen\ngovernance and public management in the Asia-Pacific Region, ADB fostered\nthe Network of Asia-Pacific Schools and Institutes of Public Administration\nand Governance (NAPSIPAG). Driven by its Governance Policy of 1995,6\nADB perceived that such a network would bring together regional institutions\nwhose  strength  was  inherent  in  their  acceptability,  influence,  and  local\nknowledge  that  could  make  them  locally  sustainable  and  powerful  change\nagents in the region. NAPSIPAG, as it is popularly known, is emerging into a\nthriving network of schools and institutes of public administration that seeks\nto enhance the quality of public administration in the Asia-Pacific region by\nenhancing  the  capacities  of  its  national  [and  subnational]  governments  to\npromote good governance, through practical, relevant, and responsive training,\neducation, and research.\n\nFurthermore,  ADB,  by  supporting  such  a  network  to  address  the\nknowledge  management  and  regional  cooperation  gap  within  the  region,\nfulfilled its mandated role to catalyze greater regional cooperation and exchange\nof good practices for development.\n\nAfter 2 years of regional dialogue and exchange, NAPSIPAG was launched\nin December 2004 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia with over a hundred institutions\ncommitting  to  such  an  enterprise.7  NAPSIPAG  aims  to  transform  into  a\nregional hub with the capacity to: (i) support effective capacity-development\ninterventions with member institutes on a sustainable basis; (ii) encourage\nthe sharing of expertise and good practices; (iii) assist the member institutes\nin the continuing expansion of the frontiers of public administration through\nresearch, knowledge-sharing and other initiatives; (iv) and foster collaboration\nbetween  and  among  the  member  institutes  and  individuals  with  common\nobjectives  and  interests. The  long-term  goal  of  creating  the  network  is  to\nenhance the capacities of public administration schools and institutes as well\nas  research  organizations  and  think-tanks  in  the  region  to  enable  them  to\ntransform their respective governments as effective agents of good governance.\n\nThe 2005 NAPSIPAG Conference Proceedings\n\nThis volume brings together a selection of the papers presented at the\n2005 NAPSIPAG Annual Conference, held in Beijing, the People\u2019s Republic\nof China (PRC), from 5 to 7 December 2005. The theme of this conference,\nselected  by  its  interim  steering  committee,  was  the  Role  of  Public\nAdministration  in  Building  a  Harmonious  Society.  Hosted  by  the  China\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\fIntroduction\n\nxi\n\nNational  School  of  Administration,  this  conference  was  attended  by  159\nparticipants from 26 countries in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThe  discussions  during  the  conference  centered  on  six  subthemes:\n(i) citizen  participation  and  local  autonomy,  (ii) public  administration\nstrategies,  (iii) innovations  in  governance  and  public  service,  (iv) conflict\nresolution  and  peace  building,  (v) constraints  and  challenges  arising  from\ndemographic transitions and imbalances, and (vi) health care for the poor. There\nwas also a special session on the teaching of public administration and policy.\nLeading papers: Two papers at the plenary session were presented to\nopen  the  conference  theme.  In  his  keynote  paper,  Marsh  discusses  recent\ndevelopments in seven states, all of them democracies in their infancy that\nexperienced rapid economic development. A democracy derives its legitimacy\nfrom all (and not just a few) people who come to participate in governance as\nequals. In the seven states, however, the ideologies and institutions through\nwhich ordinary people can have a larger role in governance are only slowly\nemerging. In this challenging environment, public administrators must develop\nnew skills\u2014in advocacy, policy, and institutional design\u2014to contribute to\nbuilding a more harmonious society. Guili highlights the need for deepening\nadministrative reforms in the PRC to solve deep-rooted problems that not\nonly hinder economic and social development but also government capability\nto  build  a  harmonious  society.  Governments  must  have  a  clearly  defined\njurisdiction  and  its  functions  must  be  kept  separate  from  the  roles  of\nnongovernmental  and  enterprise  sectors.  Guili  holds  that  the  government\nstructure  should  be  further  streamlined  to  establish  an  efficient  public\nadministration.  Further,  the  government  must  become  more  open,  fair,\nincorruptible, and concerned about the people\u2019s welfare.\n\nCitizen Participation and Local Autonomy\n\nPapers in this category emphasize the role of citizens working through\nlocal governments and civil society organizations to create harmonious societies,\nthus contributing to national development and global cooperation.\n\nKumara and Handapangoda argue that the size of the local government\ninstitution is an important determinant of participation by citizens. Smaller\nlocal governments tend to have greater potential for direct participation. Size\nis equally important in countries like the PRC, India, and Indonesia, where\nthere are much wider variations in area and population than in Sri Lanka.\nDecentralization has brought significant changes and challenges, but the process\nof  participatory  planning  in  Solo  municipality,  Indonesia,  as  described  by\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\fxii\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nWidianingsih, gives hope for successful cooperation among local communities\nwith promising trends for the future.\n\nYadamsuren  stresses  the  importance  of  citizen  participation  in  local\nbudgeting,  while  lamenting  the  fact  that  it  is  ignored  by  politicians  and\nadministrators in Mongolia. Lack of information, transparency, skills, and\naccountability blocks popular participation in local financial management.\nWhat  is  the  optimal  level  of  participation  in  local  administration  and\ndevelopment? Bhattacharyya argues for qualitative participation, citing the\nexample  of  the  total  literacy  campaign  in  West  Bengal,  India,  which  has\nincreased  the  awareness  and  participation  of  the  rural  population  in  local\ngovernment elections and decision making.\n\nSeveral papers deal with the importance of gender participation in local\ngovernment and development. India reserves a third of the elected membership\nand leadership of local government institutions for women. Bangladesh, which\nhas had a woman prime minister for more than a decade, requires at least\nthree directly elected women members in each local council. The Philippines\nhas city and municipal councils where more than half of the members are\nwomen, and sets aside 5% of the social welfare budget for women. For all\ncountries, the education of women is an important priority.\n\nThe role and activities of nongovernment organizations (NGOs) were\ndiscussed as well. Songyan analyzes nonprofit, voluntary, registered societies\nin the PRC and the large numbers of unregistered organizations that are neither\nprofit making nor political. Their effectiveness as links between government\nand  the  citizens  is,  however,  limited  by  governmental  control.  Singh  talks\nabout  successful  entrepreneurial  networks  of  NGOs,  local  government\ninstitutions, universities, and citizens cooperating in poverty alleviation projects\nin the Indian states of West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat, achieving\ntogether what they would not have been able to achieve separately.  Drawing\nthese stories together, Singh argues that NGO networks are powerful tools for\nenhancing societal harmony.\n\nReporting  on  recent  African  history,  Njunwa  explains  how  public\nadministration can create the conditions for societal harmony, citing examples\nfrom Tanzania. The society\u2019s commitment to the citizens\u2019 safety and security,\nparticipatory decision making, a sense of identity, education and training,\nand  sustained  economic  growth  and  trade  are  all  important  for  societal\nharmony.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\fIntroduction\n\nxiii\n\nPublic Administration Strategies\n\nBaulderstone singles out nonprofit community service organizations for\ntheir significant role in service delivery to disadvantaged or otherwise needy\nmembers  of  society.  Australia,  Baulderstone  said,  has  long  supported  such\norganizations through funding, preferential taxation, and acceptance of the\nsector\u2019s  role  in  influencing  policy  and  planning  decisions.  But  widespread\npublic sector reforms in the 1980s and 1990s had unfortunate consequences\nfor these organizations, as explored in the paper, which also identifies factors\nthat  would  support  the  emerging  partnership  between  the  public  and\ncommunity services sectors.\n\nInformation, Jain points out, is increasingly viewed as a vehicle for rural\nparticipation in governance and development. ICT, increasingly available at\ndeclining cost, can facilitate access to development-related information. But\nfor ICT projects to succeed, there must be coordination between levels of\ngovernment; public regulators and administrators must work together with\nprivate service providers. Civil society has a critical role in coordinating between\nthe public and private sectors. Jain\u2019s case studies from several states in India\nassessed key areas of influence and action for public administrators in providing\nrural ICT access.\n\nDirect poverty alleviation programs carried out by the Indian Government\nto generate employment in rural areas through infrastructure development\nare misdirected, as contended by Saha and Kakani. Many in the countryside\nare unemployed and poor because they have been \u201cdeskilled\u201d as political power\nhas  shifted  to  the  urban  metropolis.  Re-empowering  local  government,\nregenerating skills, and building institutions for skills development can reverse\nthe process, the authors said.\n\nAnand  examines  the  impact  of  the  large  targeted  public  distribution\nsystem in the state of Kerala, India and shows how even the best-intentioned\npublic administration strategies, when carried out the wrong way, can lead to\neven more inequality and poverty. The issues of poverty and exclusion, as well\nas the success of programs that try to deal with these issues, are inextricably\nlinked to governance\u2014as Dhakal emphasized in his study of Nepal\u2014thus,\nemphasizing the role of good governance in creating societal harmony.\n\nEconomic  efficiency  is  the  real\u2014though  seldom  explicitly  stated\u2014\nobjective  of  most  public  sector  reforms,  according  to  Khan  and  Akif.\nResponsive institutional arrangements have a vital role in realizing economic\npotential, supporting innovation, and achieving social development targets.\nGonzalez discusses the need to accommodate diversity in public management\nby  providing  equal  and  nondiscriminatory  public  services.  Poor  or\nunconstructive management of diversity can quickly lead to instability within\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\fxiv\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nstates.  Citing  the  case  of  the  Philippines,  Gonzalez  adds  that  diversity\nmanagement strategies must be developed and local government policies should\nbe made more inclusive and culture-sensitive. Communities and NGOs should\nbe  empowered  to  safeguard  their  rights  and  participate  in  governance.\nIndigenous groups, their advocates, and international partners should be linked\nin a \u201cconcerted global political constituency.\u201d The extent and availability of\ngovernment services in priority indigenous peoples\u2019 areas must be monitored.\nSignificant  and  increasing  differences  in  socioeconomic  development\nbetween regions in Uzbekistan, according to Yunusov and Yunusov, have had\nnegative consequences that reinforce social tensions and mistrust of governing\nbodies. The main goal of regional policies in Uzbekistan is the efficient use of\nregional factors and competitive advantage to ensure the sustainable economic\ndevelopment  of  the  country,  raise  living  standards,  and  lessen  the\nsocioeconomic disadvantages of regions.\n\nInnovations in Governance and Public Service\n\nBy far the largest workshop in the conference dealt with this topic. Alam,\nMian, and Smith analyze how, because of uncontrolled corruption, political\ninstability, and inadequate investment infrastructure, and despite liberalization\nand  microeconomic  reforms,  government  has  failed  to  create  the  business\nconditions that could induce investors to invest in Bangladesh. Guojun reviews\nthe evolution of entrepreneurial ecology in the PRC starting in 1979. Damiran\nand Pratt find a mixed model of government reform in Mongolia without the\nmuch-needed balancing of conflicting elements. Yiseang and Thomas focus\non  the  four  criteria  set  by  ADB  for  assessing  governance\u2014accountability,\nparticipation, predictability, and transparency\u2014while drawing attention to\nthe innovative tools for public service management implemented in Cambodia.\nNiu, Ho, and Jun Ma argue that budgeting reform would depend not\nonly on the managerial and technical capacity of the bureaucracy but also on\nthe political will of the leadership to tackle sensitive political questions such\nas intergovernmental fiscal arrangements. Shahnon reviews the performance-\nbased management system in Malaysia and suggested its use in validating and\nimproving the credibility of impact assessment and monitoring.\n\nDevelopments  in  ICT  have  helped  governments  transform  their\noperations and service delivery systems. Using the experience of India, Pathak\nand Prasad conclude that e governance can be effective in the fight against\ncorruption in developing countries. Hoque looks into how far citizen\u2019s interests\nhave  been  served  in  e-governance  initiatives  in  Bangladesh.  In  Malaysia,\naccording  to  Siddiquee,  e-government  has  had  limited  impact  because  of\ninfrastructure constraints and slow implementation.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\fIntroduction\n\nxv\n\nMishra, Mishra, and Kirinmai discuss participatory governance reforms\nin  the  Indian  state  of  Andhra  Pradesh.  Innovations  like  the  Janmabhoomi\n(serve  the  motherland)  Program,  water  users\u2019  associations,  watershed\ndevelopment  program,  and  vana  samrakshana  samithis  (community  forest\nmanagement groups) have fundamentally transformed the government-people\ninterface, the author said, but implementation has been far from effective.\n\nSumarto  focuses  on  natural  resources  conflicts  and  the  challenges  to\ngovernment  in  Indonesia.  Awareness  of  the  need  for  sustainable  natural\nresources management is crucial as it may lead to more rational and transparent\nnatural  resources  management,  Sumarto  states.  He  adds  that  curriculum\ndevelopment is an efficient way of building awareness.

Defining \u201cdemographic\nimbalance\u201d as a mismatch between resources and population, the author looked\nparticularly  at  population  movement  from  rural  to  urban  areas,  but  also\ndiscussed migration due to environmental catastrophes and other factors. Both\npapers expressed concern about the availability of accurate, reliable, and up-\nto-date statistics.\n\nHealth Care for the Poor in Asia\n\nIn less-developed Asian countries, the poor generally do not get adequate\nhealth care. Government does not devote enough resources to the sector, and\nwhat little it spends is often mismanaged. Hospital services and medicines are\npriced beyond the reach of the poor. For lack of good health care, the poor\ncannot get or keep a decent job, and they stay poor or become even poorer.\nThe papers in this session had three common themes: the privatization\nof  health  care;  sharing  of  the  financial  burdens  of  health  care  with  social\norganizations; and decentralization of health care. Although health care for\nthe  poor  in  Asia  has  greatly  improved,  much  still  needs  to  be  done.\nGovernments should change the way they perceive health, the participants\nsuggested. People\u2019s health is too important to be ignored. Governments should\ninvest more to improve their health-care systems and make them more efficient.\nSocial organizations can join in the supply of health care.\n\nA good health-care system, Sarfraz H. Khawaja points out in his paper,\nshould be equitable, efficient, and effective. Citing examples from Pakistan,\nhis  analysis  brings  out  the  essential  features  of  a  workable  health  system.\nGhuman and Mehta examine health care for the poor in India, particularly in\nthe state of Punjab, where the promised benefits to the poor from major policy\nreforms  have  not  materialized  for  various  reasons. To  give  the  poor  better\naccess to health-care services, Ghuman and Mehta suggest that the government\nshould  spend  more  on  health  care;  the  poor  should  be  made  more  aware\nabout their benefits; entitlement procedures should be simplified and made\nmore transparent and time-bound; the government should make it mandatory\nfor super-specialty hospitals to meet their targets for poor patients; and health\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\fIntroduction\n\nxvii\n\nservice  delivery  should  be  made  pro-poor,  more  vigilant,  transparent,  and\nbetter regulated.\n\nBautista  discusses  opportunities  in  public  health  governance  in  local\ngovernment units in the Philippines and improvements that still need to be\nmade, especially given the large number of the poor who rely on this system\nfor their needs. National and local health offices must engage in continuous\nadvocacy with local government officials to get them to commit to the delivery\nof  health  services  that  meet  the  needs  of  the  community  and  the  users  of\nprimary health care. National and local health offices should also use local\ninformation systems and other available technologies for governance to define\ncommunity needs, allow targeted service provision, facilitate planning and\nmonitoring and evaluation, and achieve commitments like the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals.\n\nZhang and Zhang examine the public health system in Jiangxi province\nof the PRC, in light of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome  epidemic of\n2003 and the measures taken since then by the PRC Government to forestall\nsimilar public health emergencies.

I want to approach this by discussing recent\ndevelopments  in  seven  states:  Indonesia,  Republic  of  Korea,  Malaysia,\nPhilippines, Singapore, Taipei,China, and Thailand. All have at least nominally\ndemocratic political structures and, save for Malaysia and Singapore, have\nachieved this political transition in the last decade or so. They have also all\nexperienced rapid economic development, although the outcomes, of course,\nstill vary widely. But save for Japan, these are the first non-Western states to\nachieve these kinds of economic and political development.\n\nThe adoption of democratic forms is a particularly significant step. This\ninvolves a new approach to the task of building a harmonious society. Indeed,\nit entails a wholly different notion of who determines what harmonious means.\nWhereas other political orders use property or some other limitation to restrict\nthe number of citizens, or invoke some other, usually transcendental, source\nof  legitimacy,  democracy,  nominally  at  least,  recognizes  all  the  people\u2014\nindividuals are the ultimate units of politics. Ideally, citizens come to the task\nof participating in governance with equal standing.\n\nOf course, views about the practical limits of democracy vary widely.\nFor example, in a classic study, Schumpeter suggested that citizen participation\nneeded to be limited to periodic selection between rival elite teams. In this\nconception, free and fair elections become the touchstone institution. Other\nvisions of democracy envisage enhanced self-realization, and expanded life\nchoices, as democracy\u2019s fundamental promise. Here citizen engagement is the\ntouchstone.  How  these  possibilities  unfold  in  the  distinctive  cultural\nenvironments  presented  by  these  seven  states  will,  it  is  hoped,  stir  the\nimagination of a future Asian Tocqueville or Mill or even Polanyi.\n\nMy present purpose is to identify some effects of democracy, even in\nthese initial stages, on key dimensions of governance. This political change is\n\nThis  paper  is  based  on  a  forthcoming  study:  I.  Marsh,  ed.  2006.  Democratisation,  Governance  and\nRegionalism  in  East  and  Southeast  Asia.

Public\nadministration must always be \u201cplaced\u201d in a wider structure of governance.\nPublic administrators need to understand how their roles depend on the effective\nworking of other arms of the political and policy-making system. They need to\nrecognize how these institutions condition and limit their own role\u2014and the\nsteps  they  can  take  to  improve  their  operations  and  surmount  obstacles.  In\nbuilding understanding of these issues, the idea of state capacity provides an\nappropriate template. This concept has a distinguished provenance and covers\ngovernance in all its aspects (e.g., Wade 1990, Painter and Pierre 2005).\n\nState capacity is divided into three primary components, namely, political,\npolicy, and administrative capacity. Political capacity covers the formal and\ninformal institutions that mediate citizen engagement, create legitimacy, and\nunderwrite executive authority and decisiveness. Policy capacity refers to the\nconcepts,  strategies,  and  institutions  that  inform  and  shape  policy\ndeliberations, and administrative capacity to the ability of bureaucracies to\nimplement agreed strategies.\n\nIn this paper, I review in detail key elements of the three components of\nstate capacity. Political capacity covers three aspects: political culture, political\nparties, and the formation of executives. Policy capacity covers two elements:\nexecutive-legislative relations and the assimilation of new policy strategies.\nAdministrative  capacity  covers  bureaucratic  politicization  and  interest\naggregation. These add up to seven elements in total. These seven elements\nare, of course, interdependent, and state capacity can be variously composed\ndepending on the condition of the individual elements and the significance of\neach  element  in  the  broader  system  of  governance.  There  are  also  other\nimportant aspects of governance, such as the media and the judicial system,\nwhich we are not considering (e.g., Rich and Williams 2000).\n\nIn  the  remarks  that  follow,  I  want  to  focus  particularly  on  political\ncapacity, since this is perhaps the most complex and multifaceted of our three\ncomponents. Here three features are discussed: the social base of individual\npolitical systems, the nature and role of political parties, and the formation of\npolitical elites.\n\nCitizen Attitudes and Orientations\n\nThe starting point for evaluating the likely character of the challenges\nassociated with the adoption of democracy concerns citizen attitudes. While\nclearly not decisive, citizen attitudes inevitably attain a new standing in this\npattern of politics. Through a survey undertaken at the end of 2000, Richard\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nPlenary 1.pmd\n\n4\n\n20/11/2006, 3:10 PM\n\n\fDemocratization and State Capacity in East and Southeast Asia\n\n5\n\nSinnott has examined aspects of the political cultures in the seven states.2 He\nconsidered  16  variables  in  six  categories:  political  efficacy  and  knowledge,\nideology, identity, confidence in the system, satisfaction with the system, and\npolitical participation.3\n\nThe results for individual states are summarized in the appendix. These\nresults show the remarkable differences between the individual states. The\nideal types used to characterize citizen orientations in Western assessments\ninvolve  a  taxonomy  that  broadly  distinguishes  between  so-called  subjects,\nparticipants, and critical citizens\u2014terms that are somewhat elastic and that\ncover relatively quiescent citizens, who are inclined to defer to governing elites,\nas  well  as  a  more  skeptical  citizenry,  who  are  more  likely  to  challenge  the\ngoverning elites.\n\nAs far as our seven countries are concerned, the data suggest that the\ncitizens of Singapore clearly tend toward the subject pole of this spectrum and\nthe citizens of the Republic of Korea, the skeptical or critical one. The other\nstates tend toward one or the other pole but with important variations and\nqualifications. Singaporeans are relatively politically quiescent, with a relatively\nweak national identity and a high level of pride in the outputs of the political\nprocess, a high level of satisfaction with politics, high confidence in the national\nparliament and in the civil service, and, finally, a low propensity to political\naction, defined in terms of contact with elected representatives, involvement\nin party and electoral politics, and partisan or campaigning activity.\n\nIndonesian and Malaysian citizens also display political attitudes and\nperceptions that tend to place them on the more quiescent side of this spectrum.\nBut  neither  country  is  unambiguously  located  there.  Indonesia\u2019s  deviant\nrankings are related to that country\u2019s higher level of political knowledge and\nsomewhat higher level of political efficacy and lower level of political deference.\nMalaysian  deviance  results  from  a  high  level  of  party  involvement  and  a\nrelatively strong sense of national identity.\n\n2 This paper draws on data on political cultures and globalization collected through the Asia-Europe\n(ASES) survey conducted in 2000, a project led by Professor Takashi Inoguchi (University of Tokyo)\nand sponsored by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Tokyo (Project\nNumber  11102000). The  European  countries  surveyed  were:  France,  Germany,  Greece,  Ireland,\nPortugal,  Spain,  Sweden,  and  United  Kingdom. The  Asian  countries  were:  People\u2019s  Republic  of\nChina, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taipei,China, and\nThailand.

Its citizens have a high sense of political efficacy and low confidence\nin their government. They have strong regional loyalties and relatively high\nlevels of participation. This was reflected in the campaigns of nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs) on behalf of liberal and Left candidates in 2000 and\n2004 culminating in the election of the first liberal government in 2004 (Shin\n2003, Cha 2005). For their part, Taipei,China\u2019s citizens show less political\nefficacy,  more  deference,  and  weaker  national  identity  than  unambiguous\nplacement on the skeptical side of the spectrum would require. Taipei,China\u2019s\nambiguous international status may, of course, be a factor in this result. Finally,\nthe Philippines has less political efficacy, decidedly less political knowledge,\nand more pride in the country\u2019s welfare system (such as it is) than would be\nthe case in a typical \u201cparticipant\u201d country.\n\nThe foregoing placement of countries leaves one country, Thailand, in\nthe middle. This is not because it is consistently in the middle of the spectrum;\nin fact, it appears in the middle on only four variables. Its placement is due\nrather to the conflicting characteristics it exhibits. Thus, it is highly placed in\nterms of identity variables but low on deference and on aspects of institutional\nconfidence. However, despite having quite a high sense of political efficacy, it is\nextremely low on the political action variables (except for potential involvement\nin  local  community  efforts  to  solve  local  problems). This  lack  of  political\nmobilization is crucial in the decision to treat Thailand as a middle case.\n\nIn sum, one could argue that these seven countries can be divided into\ntwo groups of three\u2014with Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore on the more\nquiescent side, and Republic of Korea, Philippines, and Taipei,China on the\nmore skeptical or activist side\u2014and Thailand in the middle. Which of these\nsets of orientations will lead more rapidly and more securely to a consolidated\nand stable democratic system is, of course, unclear. A variety of intermediary\ninstitutions contribute critically and variably to this outcome. But these data\nprovide some pointers to the democratic challenges that arise at this primary\nlevel.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nPlenary 1.pmd\n\n6\n\n20/11/2006, 3:10 PM\n\n\fDemocratization and State Capacity in East and Southeast Asia\n\n7\n\nPolitical Parties\n\nPolitical parties can perform critical roles in mobilizing individual citizens\ninto relatively stable political engagements. They are the primary intermediary\ninstitutions. In the Western experience, mass political parties were the agents\nnot only of democratic representation but also of democratic socialization.4\nThe causal sequence may have varied, but democracy was everywhere\nthe fruit of a bottom-up agitation based partly on the emergence of an industrial\nworking  class,  partly  on  the  development  of  trade  unions,  and  partly  on\nideologies  of  laborism,  socialism,  or  communism.  Mass  political  parties\nprogressively  emerged  to  spearhead  political  advocacy.  Coalitions  with\nbourgeois, agrarian, or religious interests were variously formed. By such means,\nand also as a result of war and civil war, more or less authoritarian political\nsystems were progressively displaced by liberal democratic regimes.\n\nWhat form are political parties taking in regional states? Save for Malaysia\nand Taipei,China,  the  cleavages\u2014ideological,  center-periphery,  religious\u2014\nthat  differentiated  identities  and  were  the  essential  foundation  for  party\ndevelopment in Europe either do not exist or do not have political salience.\nNor are the organizational forms that would provide a durable foundation\nfor  party  development  in  evidence.  Save  for  United  Malays  National\nOrganization (UMNO) in Malaysia, the major parties in Taipei,China, and\nperhaps Partai Golongan Karya or Party of Functional Groups (Golkar), Partai\nDemokrasi Indonesia Perjuangan or Indonesian Democratic Party for Struggle\n(PDI-P,) and Partai Keadilan Sejahtera or Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) in\nIndonesia and the Democratic Party in Thailand, parties in the states covered\nhave no or very limited branch structures, no mass memberships, no internal\npolicy  development  mechanisms,  and  virtually  no  or  very  limited  durable\norganizations. Where a durable organization exists, its focus is the leadership\n\n4\n\nIn the literature on political development, the role of mass parties was critical. These bodies not only\nrepresented citizen views, they also contributed to the formation of citizens. They politicized identity.\nFor example, the following describes the socializing and mobilizing contribution of  the German\nSocial Democratic party in its first years:\n\nThere emerged in the years leading up to World War I a socialist counter-culture and interlocking\ninstitutions. Aside from the party organisation, with over one million members by 1914, there was\nthe  massive  union  organisation  with  2.5  million  members. Then  there  was  the  party  press\u201490\ndaily  papers  with  a  circulation  of  1.5  million  copies,  a  humorous  weekly  with  a  circulation  of\n380,000, a multitude of other publications (e.g., Der Arbeiter-Radfahrer\u2014The Worker Cyclist\u2014\ncirculation  168,000),  printing  houses  and  more.  Isolated  from  mainstream  society  by  choice  or\nimposition, often banned from or unwelcome at the non-socialist societies, the socialist sub-culture\ncreated their own societies. There were socialist sporting organisations\u2014cycling, football, athletics\n(with  a  multitude  of  sub-societies,  e.g.,  boxing),  swimming,  hiking,  rowing,  sailing;  socialist\neducational institutions (including 1,100 libraries, 800,000 volumes, 365 librarians with their own\njournal); socialist cultural organisations like choral societies, theatres and much more. The SPD\nlaid siege to mainstream society with an entire parallel social structure. (Norman 2001, page 48).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nPlenary 1.pmd\n\n7\n\n20/11/2006, 3:10 PM\n\n\f8\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\ngroup rather than the membership base. Nor are parties largely a legal artifact,\npartly dependent on the rules of party competition, as in the United States\n(Katz 1994). Parties do not conform to \u201celectoral-professional\u201d or \u201ccatch-all\u201d\nor \u201ccartel\u201d patterns, to follow the descriptions current in recent Western party\nliterature (Mair 1997). Rather, as Jean Blondel points out, they are primarily\nbased on leaders with established national standing.5 These individuals can\ntake a preexisting organization and reshape it in their own image (Kim Dae\nJung, Roh Moo-hyun) or they can build a new organization (Thaksin). In\neither case, power flows outward and downward from the leader, not upward\nfrom  a  mass  membership.  Prime  Minister  Berlusconi  provides  a  Western\nanalogue for this particular pattern.\n\nEmerging patterns of representation and, perhaps even more importantly,\npatterns of political socialization in East and Southeast Asia will take a very\ndifferent form from those made familiar in Western experience. Top-down\ndemocratization has produced a superficially familiar formal structure, but\nthe task of citizen development remains. If political parties are not to be the\nimmediate medium for these processes, are there alternatives?\n\nIndeed, in the absence of basic democratic socialization, disappointment\nwith political outcomes may focus not primarily on current officeholders but\nrather on the overall system\u2014because attachment to the basic process has\nremained stillborn. There is a hint of this possibility in the waxing and waning\nof public support for democracy in the Republic of Korea (Shin 2003) and in\npublic attitudes to the political system in Taipei,China (Chu, Diamond, and\nShin 2001). This is, of course, wholly speculative. What is clear is that, in the\nabsence of intermediary organizations, particularly mass parties, the processes\nby which citizens will be mobilized into political engagement, and socialized\ninto democratic norms, deserve much closer attention.\n\nThe Development of Political Elites6\n\nDemocratic  consolidation  could  be  expected  to  be  marked  by  new\npatterns  of  elite  formation.  Ministers  would  increasingly  be  drawn  from\nrepresentative organizations and activities. This is because of their twin but\ndivergent roles at the apex of the political and policy-making system: on the\none hand, they need to gain popular and interest-group consent for executive\ndecisions; on the other, they are also formally responsible for managerial and\npolicy  effectiveness.  These  twin  responsibilities  also  make  these  elites\n\n5 Chapter 3: Parties and Party Systems in East and Southeast Asia by Jean Blondel.\n6 Chapter 4: National Executives in East and Southeast Asia by Jean Blondel.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nPlenary 1.pmd\n\n8\n\n20/11/2006, 3:10 PM\n\n\fDemocratization and State Capacity in East and Southeast Asia\n\n9\n\nparticularly significant in the formation of state capacity. There is no clear\nmetric for measuring either of these outcomes. But the undeveloped character\nof political parties is the biggest obstacle impeding democratic consolidation\nat the level of executive composition. In general, and with the exception of\nMalaysia,  ministerial  careers  mostly  remain  as  extensions  of  public  service\nactivities.\n\nPatterns of leadership and executive formation vary markedly in individual\ncountries.  One  cause  is  the  political  structure. The  stylized  notion  that\npresidential systems create hierarchical relationships, and parliamentary systems\ncollegial ones, does not square with practice. A wider range of mainly informal\nfactors shapes outcomes. In relation to the selection of leaders, those states\nwith presidential or semi-presidential systems (Indonesia, Republic of Korea,\nPhilippines, and Taipei,China) have all adapted first past the post-electoral\nsystems. Presidents have been elected on less than a plurality of votes, with an\naverage of around 40% and the lowest that of Ramos in the Philippines, who\ngained office in 1992 with 25% of the popular vote. Among these states, only\nIndonesia has adopted a runoff system.\n\nLeaders can be dominating or they can share power. Dual leadership has\noccurred in the semi-presidential systems: in the Republic of Korea for 18\nmonths  in  the  Kim  Dae  Jung\u2013Kim  Jong  Pil  alliance,  and  in Taipei,China\nwith the  9-month appointment of Tang Fei as prime minister by President\nChen. The tenure of leaders has been considerable in the semi-pluralist states,\nwith Lee Kuan Yew in office for 25 years, Goh for 10 years, Mahathir for 20\nyears. The incumbency of presidents in the presidential and semi-presidential\nstates is limited to one term in the Republic of Korea and the Philippines and\ntwo terms in Indonesia and Taipei,China. On the other hand, the Republic of\nKorea had 18 prime ministers between 1980 and 2000, seven for only a few\nmonths, and none much more than 2 years. In Taipei,China, there were four\nprime ministers between 1988 and 2000, all for 2 years except for Lien Chen,\nwho served 4 years and then was beaten for the presidency by Chen Shui Bian.\nThe military was the source of leaders for Indonesia up to 1999 and\nthen again in 2004, Republic of Korea up to 1992, Taipei,China up to 1988,\nand Thailand up to 1991. As already noted, the more recent crop of civilian\nleaders  has  been  made  up  of  national  rather  than  party  figures.  Blondel\nconcludes that history and circumstances, not formal governance structures,\nare the primary determinants of leadership styles and approaches:\n\nPolitical leadership in East and Southeast Asia is\u2026diverse in its role, its\norigins, its duration, its composition and its mode of appointment. What\nappears  to  be  a  universal  problem\u2014that  of  ensuring  the  economy\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nPlenary 1.pmd\n\n9\n\n20/11/2006, 3:10 PM\n\n\f10\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nprogresses\u2014and  a  widespread  if  not  yet  universal  concern\u2014that  of\nrendering political life more pluralistic\u2014has been handled in a different\nmanner in [each of these seven states] (pages 120\u2013121).\n\nAs  far  as  executives  are  concerned,  Blondel  notes  they  have  primarily\nbeen administrative in character. Only in Malaysia and Singapore and perhaps\nIndonesia are ministers part of a recognized political elite. The duration of\nministers in office averaged 3.8 years in the 1990s. But there were wide variances,\nwith Singapore recording an average of 6.6 years (the top pole) and the Republic\nof Korea, 1.4 years (the bottom pole). The causes for variations in tenure are\ncountry-specific and have nothing to do with the form of the regime.\n\nThe administrative character of executives is reflected in the background\n\nof ministers.\n\nThe  type  of  profile  that  characterizes  the  governments  of  Indonesia,\nRepublic of Korea, Singapore, Taipei,China, and with reservations, Thailand,\nindicates that the ministerial career in these countries is more in the nature of\nan appendage to a public service career to which, especially in Indonesia and\nThailand, as well as, to an extent, Republic of Korea, the military is regarded\nas belonging.\n\nThe development of \u201cpolitical\u201d executives would seem to depend on the\n\nfurther development of durable political parties.\n\nFinally,  one  distinctive  pattern  in  executive  formation  concerns  the\ncirculation  of  Members  of  Parliament  (MPs)  after  elections  as  individuals\nregroup around the winner. This is a particular feature of Indonesia, Republic\nof Korea, and Philippines. But it is unclear if this indicates the formation of\nan ad hoc coalition or rather a government of the president. An explicit coalition\ngovernment is present only in Malaysia.\n\nPolicy and Administrative Capacity\n\nThe other components of state capacity present other, no less substantial,\nchallenges. For example, executive-legislative relations have been a particular\nissue  in  the  four  presidential  and  semi-presidential  systems\u2014Indonesia,\nRepublic  of  Korea,  Philippines,  and Taipei,China. The  Republic  of  Korea\nand Taipei,China have had particularly turbulent experiences with divided\ngovernment. The Taiwan  Assembly  continues  to  block  legislation  that  the\nexecutive has labeled critical, particularly covering arms purchases from the\nUnited States. By contrast, the 2004 Assembly election in the Republic of\nKorea introduced the first liberal or Left-inclined regime. For the first time,\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nPlenary 1.pmd\n\n10\n\n20/11/2006, 3:10 PM\n\n\fDemocratization and State Capacity in East and Southeast Asia\n\n11\n\nthe party that controlled the presidency also enjoyed a majority in the National\nAssembly.  The  Philippine  Congress  enjoys  substantial  powers,  including\nimpeachment, which it exercised against former president Estrada in 2000.\nCongress  has  thwarted  important  elements  of  President  Arroyo\u2019s  program.\nFinally, the Indonesian case presents the most ambiguous example of unresolved\nexecutive-legislative relations. The relationship between the president and the\nlegislature  (DPR)  remains  unresolved.  Huntington  has  identified  metrics\n(adaptability,  complexity,  autonomy,  and  coherence)  by  which  legislative\nconsolidation could be assessed (cited in Park 2000). Procedural norms are\ninsufficiently developed for even rudimentary application.\n\nThe ability to identify and define new policy strategies is a second area of\npolicy  capacity.  Two  important  areas  that  are  potentially  affected  by\ndemocratization are social and economic policy. Social policy could be expected\nto rise in salience as a result of popular pressure and economic policy may\nhave to be framed with greater regard to public attitudes. Ramesh (2004) has\nrecently surveyed developments in the important area of social policy, which\nis clearly emerging as a much more significant domain (also Gough 2000).\nEconomic governance has traditionally been a critical domain. Notably in the\nRepublic  of  Korea,  Singapore,  and  Taipei,China,  it  has  hitherto  taken  a\ndistinctive, state-led form. The requirements of economic governance have\nprogressively become much more demanding, with the very complex notion\nof  managing  whole  systems  (crossing  a  variety  of  public  and  private\norganizations and interests) attaining greater prominence (e.g., Lipsey, Carlaw\nand  Beckar  2006;  Porter  2003).  This  has  resulted  from  the  increased\ninterdependencies associated variously with both multinational corporation\n(MNC) engagement and entry to science-based sectors. During the late 1980s,\nRepublic  of  Korea,  Singapore,  and Taipei,China  moved  progressively  into\nadvanced  technology  sectors  in  electronics.  From  the  mid-1990s,  their\nambitions  extended  to  science-based  sectors  like  biotechnology,\nnanotechnology, and new materials. They have also sought to establish a strong\nposition  in  services  (such  as  software  and,  in  Singapore\u2019s  case,  health  and\neducation).\n\nThese same challenges are apparent, if in a different form, in the other\nstates. The Malaysian Government has been the most ambitious of the second-\ntier newly industrialized countries (NICs). From the early 1990s, the Mahathir\ngovernment  introduced  an  industry  strategy,  which  sought  to  accelerate\ndevelopment in the manufacturing sector, particularly electronics. While the\nstrategic framework for industry development has been put in place, sectoral\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nPlenary 1.pmd\n\n11\n\n20/11/2006, 3:10 PM\n\n\f12\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\ncapabilities have been found to be inadequate.7 In July 2005, a new industrial\ndevelopment strategy was announced that encouraged participation by local\nsmall and medium enterprises in MNC supply chains, as well as programs to\nupgrade both individual skills and business capabilities. Indonesia,  Philippines,\nand Thailand all face similar challenges. For example, according to Doner\nand Ramsay (2003), the present imperative for Thailand is to shift from a\nstrategy based on low-cost manufacturing to one based on upgrading. This\nrequires  governance  capabilities  at  systemic  and  sectoral  levels.  It  requires\ninstitutions that can mediate human resource development, supplier linkages,\ntechnology development, and the introduction of advanced infrastructure.\nDoner and Ramsay illustrate particular patterns through analyses of electronics,\ntextiles, and automobiles\u2014all sectors in which Thailand has built a reasonably\nstrong position. Evidence that weaknesses are being tackled is sparse.\n\nTurning from policy capacity, we look at administrative capacity, which\nbasically involves the ability to implement agreed plans and programs. An\neffective bureaucracy is the key. Martin Painter has explored the \u201cquality\u201d of\nbureaucracy in the seven states against such key norms as \u201cneutral competence\u201d\nand capacity for administrative reform.8 Save for two exceptions, his account\nis of systems under considerable stress. This is the result of internal failings,\nuncertainties arising from the political context, or some combination of these\nfactors. The two exceptions are Malaysia and Singapore. In these states, semi-\npluralist  political  systems  have  produced  governments  with  relatively\nunambiguous  authority.  Meantime  their  background  as  British  colonies\nproduced  civil  services  with  strong  internal  norms  of  neutral  competence,\ntraditions that have not been upset since independence. These bureaucracies\nhave developed \u201ca culture of administrative self improvement that operates\nwithin limited boundaries defined in part by regime goals.\u201d\n\n7\n\nIn an evaluation of electronics developments, Matthews and Cho question implementation capacities:\n\u201cThe direction towards upgrading is there but its execution has been slow\u2014although much more\nadvanced than in neighbouring countries like Thailand and the Philippines\u201d (page 276). Jomo and\nFelker (1999) suggest bureaucratic capacities for sectoral analysis and for monitoring implementation\nare inadequate. They suggest that state-led strategies approaches have not been backed by adequate\nanalysis and oversight: \u201cIt is precisely the sparseness of...capacity for detailed, continuous sector-\nspecific assessment of market and industry trends which is the greatest constraint on effective industry\nimplementation\u201d  (page  25;  see  also  Dodgson,  in  Kim  and  Nelson,  pages  258\u2013260).  Doner  and\nRamsay (2003, pages 203\u2013205, 213\u2013214, 220\u2013222) reached a similar conclusion in their comparative\nassessment of the development of the hard-disk-drive industry in Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand.\nWhile  Malaysia  showed  more  strategic  capacity  than Thailand  (but,  of  course,  much  less  than\nSingapore), there was little evidence of ability to implement policy at the sectoral level\u2014save for the\nPenang Development Corporation, which was the model for the broader strategy.\n8 Chapter 5: Bureaucratic Performance, Policy Capacity and Administrative Reform.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nPlenary 1.pmd\n\n12\n\n20/11/2006, 3:10 PM\n\n\fDemocratization and State Capacity in East and Southeast Asia\n\n13\n\nA final element of administrative capacity involves interest aggregation.\nThe  absence  of  comparative  studies  of  interest  formation  and  interest\nintermediation in regional states is a major gap. The only exception concerns\nrelations between business interests and the state. Business-government relations\nwere  central  to  one  approach  that  argued  that  regional  patterns  sustained\ndysfunctional rent seeking and cronyism (Lingle 1998).This relationship also\nbecame increasingly central in the evolution of the developmental state ideal\n(Evans 1995, Weiss and Hobson 1995, Woo-Cumings 1999, Weiss 2003).\nBut the pattern of business-government relations has varied widely under the\npressure of new economic governance challenges, as well as new patterns of\ninterest  formation. There  have  been  limited  experiments  with  corporatist-\ntype  structures  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  and Taipei,China.  Following  his\nelection in 1997, President Kim established a Tripartite Commission. The\ntrade unions withdrew from this body in 1998 but rejoined in 1999. President\nLee set up a National Affairs Conference in 1990 and a National Development\nConference in 1996. No other states have sought to develop corporatist forms.\nIf business interests are well established and organized in most states, the\nsame could not be said for trade unions. The Republic of Korea has the most-\ndeveloped trade union movement, but representation is split between two\nrival  federations.  But  both  federations  (the  600,000-strong  Korean\nConfederation of  Trade Unions [KCTU] and the 900,000-member Federation\nof Korean Trade Unions [FKTU]) joined other NGOs in a progressive alliance\nbased on the Democratic Labour Party, which contested the 2002 election\nand won six Assembly seats in the 2004 election. Trade unions are relatively\nweak in, Malaysia, Taipei,China, and Thailand, and have been controlled in\nSingapore. Democratization changes the context of interest formation and\nintermediation. But patterns have not been systematically traced and compared,\nand this remains a major gap in the comparative literature.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn  five  of  the  seven  states  reviewed  here,  the  political  framework  has\nbeen  transfigured  in  recent  years.  The  framework  within  which  public\nadministrators seek to contribute to the construction of a harmonious society\nis  naturally  also  transformed,  as  a  result.  Public  administrators  need  to\nunderstand how this changes the context in which they are working if they are\nto realistically assess the challenges that they face, the limits that other actors\nimpose on their own capacity to shape events, and ways in which such obstacles\nmight be transcended.\n\nThe change to a democratic structure potentially transforms the nature\nof political authority. Ideally, it advances self-realization, expands life choices,\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nPlenary 1.pmd\n\n13\n\n20/11/2006, 3:10 PM\n\n\f14\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nand  endows  public  opinion  with  a  much  greater  salience  in  political\ndetermination. Indeed, people power has already clearly shown its strength\nand potential. But the institutions and processes through which its otherwise\nsporadic expression might be transformed into routine political pressure mostly\nremain  underdeveloped.  Save  for  Malaysia  and Taipei,China  and  perhaps\nIndonesia, the states surveyed here have not developed broad-based political\nparties, and the cleavages that might be the foundation for such developments\nare not immediately obvious. Yet bottom-up political parties were critical to\ndemocratic consolidation in Western states.\n\nDemocratic institutions also multiply the number of veto points in the\npolitical structure, make these interventions much more transparent, and can\nmultiply incentives for opposition parties to exploit these opportunities. In\npathologies of democracy, ambitious aspirants use these opportunities to distort\nor paralyze decision making.\n\nHow has the need to develop broad-based political parties been avoided,\nand how have these states escaped paralyzing rivalries and conflicts? There\nwould seem to be a single broad answer to both these issues, albeit one that\ncomes with very significant local variations. Arguably, stable government has\nmostly been preserved because the elite consensus that was forged in the pre-\ndemocratic period has carried forward into the new political environment.\nElite consensus, at least about economic goals, remains the primary foundation\nof political authority. Meantime political rivalry has focused on personality or\npopulist issues and has been expressed through leader-based political parties.\nThere are stirrings at the level of civil society but (save for the Republic of\nKorea) these are mostly confined to urban regions and involve relatively small\nnumbers.  In  the  Republic  of  Korea  and  Singapore,  an  accomplished\nbureaucracy buttresses state capacity, supported, in the latter case, by a variety\nof rules that inhibit political dissent. In the case of the Republic of Korea, a\nsingle-term presidency and turbulence in executive-legislative relations have\nproduced  that  country\u2019s  first  consolidated  Left-liberal  administration. The\nissue of sovereignty has created a real cleavage and a more problematic political\ndynamic in Taipei,China. Meantime, in two of the remaining states, Malaysia\nand Thailand, strong leaders have been the immediate sheet anchor of state\ncapacity. In Malaysia\u2019s case, this is buttressed by well-developed institutional\narrangements, which Prime Minister Thaksin seems to be seeking to emulate\nin Thailand. Indonesia and the Philippines are more problematic cases.\n\nIn sum, in these seven states, democratic forms are in their infancy. The\ncapacity of ordinary people to play a larger role in defining the meaning of a\nharmonious  society  has  potentially  been  considerably  expanded,  but  the\nideologies and institutions through which this potential can be converted to\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nPlenary 1.pmd\n\n14\n\n20/11/2006, 3:10 PM\n\n\fDemocratization and State Capacity in East and Southeast Asia\n\n15\n\nactuality are only slowly emerging. Indeed, in several cases such possibilities\nhave been deliberately stanched. For the moment, democratic regimes mostly\nconstitute  a  kind  of  varnish,  beneath  which  older  patterns  of  power  and\nauthority have been reconstituted.\n\nDespite this, democratization has meant that public administrators in\nfive of these seven states face more complex institutional environments. If\nthey are to contribute to building a more harmonious society they too must\ndevelop new skills\u2014skills of advocacy and persuasion, new policy or technical\nskills, and new skills in institutional design. Skills in advocacy, brokerage, and\npersuasion all attain a new standing as authority moves, however slowly, from\nhierarchy to consent. New policy or technical skills are needed as new issues\ncome forward on the political agenda, as older issues are redefined in new\ncontexts, or as more values and perspectives need to be accommodated in\nfinding solutions to any of these matters. Finally, new skills in institutional\ndesign may be required as whole policy systems become the focus of state\naction and as a wider variety of stakeholders need to be accommodated in\ndecision making. In these and other ways, \u201cnew modes and orders\u201d create\nhigh challenges for both the theory and the practice of public administration.\n\nPlenary 1.pmd\n\n15\n\n20/11/2006, 3:10 PM\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\f16\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nReferences\n\nCha, V. 2005.

of the Chinese Government\nin Building a Harmonious Society\nBo Guili1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this new century, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China\n(PRC) has set the strategic goal of building a harmonious socialist society in\nthe course of modernization. Governments at various levels have a unique\npart in meeting this goal.\n\nBuilding a Harmonious Society: Historical Background\nand Significance\n\nInternational  experience  shows  that  when  a  country  has  a  per  capita\ngross  development  product  (GDP)  in  the  range  of  $1,000\u2013$3,000,  it  will\nexperience  the  most  serious  bottlenecks  in  population,  resources,  and  the\nenvironment,  and  face  the  risk  of  economic  and  social  disorder  and\npsychological imbalance. It is also in a critical period of social adjustment and\nreconstruction. The PRC\u2019s per capita GDP hit $1,000 in 2003 and is striving\nto reach $3,000. In other words, the country has reached a critical period in\nits modernization. As it marches steadily forward, the PRC faces an upsurge\nof conflicts as well as strategic opportunities for development. To properly\ndeal with the conflicts, take full advantage of the opportunities, and create a\nstable and harmonious social environment for modernization, the Government\nhas put forward the strategic goal of building a harmonious socialist society.\nWhat is a harmonious society? What kind of harmonious society are we\n\ntrying to build? President Hu Jintao gave us a good answer:\n\nThe  harmonious  socialist  society  that  we  are  trying  to  build  features\ndemocracy,  rule  of  law,  fairness,  justice,  honesty,  fraternity,  dynamism,\nstability, orderliness and harmony between man and nature. Democracy\nand rule of law means that socialist democracy is brought into full play,\nthe basic policy of rule of law is implemented, and the positive elements of\nvarious sides are fully mobilized. Fairness and justice means that the interests\nof various social sectors are appropriately coordinated, civil conflicts and\n\n1\n\nProfessor, Department of Public Management, China National School of Administration, People\u2019s\nRepublic of China.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nPlenary 1.pmd\n\n19\n\n20/11/2006, 3:10 PM\n\n\f20\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nother social conflicts are correctly handled, and social fairness and justice is\ndefended and realized. Honesty and fraternity means that everyone helps\none another, honesty prevails in the society, and the people live next to each\nother in harmony with equality and fraternity. Dynamism means that every\ncreative  wish  that  is  conducive  to  social  development  will  be  respected,\ncreative activities will be supported, creative talents will be given free rein,\nand creative accomplishments will be acknowledged. Stability and orderliness\nmeans sound social organization mechanism, social management, and social\norder; people live and work in peace and contentment; social stability and\nunity are maintained. Harmony between man and nature means economic\ndevelopment, wealthy life, and balanced ecology.\n\nThese major features of a harmonious society constitute a unified whole,\n\nessential to realizing the strategic goal.\n\nBuilding  a  harmonious  socialist  society  has  great  significance  and\nprofound influence. First of all, it represents the fundamental interests and\nwishes of the people, who need a stable, orderly, united, and harmonious\nsociety.\n\nSecond,  achieving  the  goal  has  a  direct  bearing  on  the  country\u2019s\nmodernization. The PRC is a developing country. We have a long way to go\nto modernize. Without social harmony, the modernization drive may be cut\nshort and the achievements wasted.\n\nThird, building a harmonious society has a direct bearing on our political\nstability and lasting peace and order. For any country in any era, social harmony\nand stability are the basis of political stability. A society where there are many\nconflicts, some of which intensify into clashes, will inevitably fall into political\ncrisis, with very serious impact on peace and development in the international\ncommunity.\n\nThe Role of Government in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nA harmonious society does not come about automatically. Government\n\nmust build such a society.\n\nFirst, it must safeguard citizens\u2019 lawful rights. A harmonious society is\nnot an ultra-stable society under authoritarian control, but a democratic society\nthat adheres to the rule of law. The Constitution of the PRC guarantees basic\nrights to all citizens\u2014equality before the law; the right to vote and stand for\nelection; freedom of speech, press, assembly, association, demonstration, and\nreligious belief; personal freedom; personal dignity and inviolability of abode;\nthe right to work, to rest, and to receive an education; the right of those who\nare old, ill, or disabled to receive material assistance from the state and society;\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nPlenary 1.pmd\n\n20\n\n20/11/2006, 3:10 PM\n\n\fThe Role of the Chinese Government in Building a Harmonious Society\n\n21\n\nthe freedom to engage in scientific research, literary and artistic creation, and\nother cultural pursuits. Government belongs to the people. Hence, its primary\nresponsibility is to safeguard citizens\u2019 basic rights and to create conditions and\nprovide the necessary guarantees for those rights to be realized. If their basic\nrights  are  safeguarded  and  guaranteed,  the  citizens  can  be  encouraged  to\nparticipate more fully in state and social management. Failure to safeguard\ncitizens\u2019 rights will lead to conflicts and clashes, which will seriously challenge\nsocial stability and harmony. In recent years, some local governments have\nnot done well in this aspect and mishandled such issues as the takeover of\nland from farmers, urban renewal, and the reemployment of laid-off workers.\nThe lawful rights of the disadvantaged groups were not properly safeguarded,\nso that citizens clamored for help from the authorities.\n\nSecond, economic and social development must be systematic. Systematic\neconomic development and ever-improving productivity are the economic\nfoundation of a harmonious society, and a sound social structure and social\norder are its social basis. In the past, the Government was unaware of economic\nand social development theories, and could not give systematic guidance to\neconomic and social development. Today it can, with the help of advances in\nthe social sciences (e.g., economics and sociology). Governments at various\nlevels must therefore study economic and social development theories to guide\neconomic  and  social  development.  In  this  way,  detours  can  be  avoided,\ndevelopment costs can go down, waste can be reduced, and economy and\nsociety, and man and nature, can benevolently interact.\n\nFrom the late 1950s through the 1970s, the Government made huge\nmistakes in guiding economic and social development, leading to the chaos of\nthe \u201cCultural Revolution.\u201d Since 1978, the Government has boldly restored\norder and set the right policy of \u201cfocusing on economic construction, upholding\nthe four cardinal principles, and sticking to reform and opening up.\u201d The\ncountry has marched down the road to modernization. In the new century,\nthe Government has transformed the development concept and adopted a\nmore systematic perspective, embraced the principle of human-centeredness,\ninnovated development models, enhanced development quality, implemented\nthe  \u201cfive  balanced  aspects\u201d  (urban  and  rural  development,  balanced\ndevelopment of the regions, economic and social development, development\nof  man  and  nature,  and  domestic  development  and  wider  opening  to  the\noutside world), and gradually brought economic and social development onto\nthe track of coordinated and sustainable development, thus clearly showing\nthe way to a harmonious socialist society.\n\nThird, the Government must provide public goods and public services\nfor economic and social development. As living standards improve, the demand\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nPlenary 1.pmd\n\n21\n\n20/11/2006, 3:10 PM\n\n\f22\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nfor  public  goods  and  public  services  also  grows. The  people  want  better\neducation, a more secure and effective public health system, more convenient\ntransportation  and  communication  facilities,  a  safer  social  environment,  a\nbetter  natural  environment,  cleaner  air  and  drinking  water.  Satisfying  the\npeople\u2019s growing need for public goods and services is safeguarding their lawful\nrights, which is the primary function of government in building a harmonious\nsociety. If it earnestly performs this function, the Government can create a\nfavorable environment for socioeconomic development, rally the enthusiasm\nof the social sectors, enhance creativity, and energize the society. But if the\nGovernment does not perform this function satisfactorily, people\u2019s reasonable\nneeds will not be met, there will be popular resentment, and our drive to\nbuild a harmonious society will be seriously undermined.\n\nFourth, the Government must systematically and reasonably regulate\nand control social and economic development. Building a harmonious society\ncalls for coordinated and sustainable social and economic development. But\nmarket mechanisms do not help in realizing this goal because market regulation\nis mainly post-regulation. Players try to maximize their own interests instead\nof the public interest. Without macro control by government, the economic\nstructure  cannot  be  rationalized  and  the  macroeconomic  environment\nstabilized;  neither  can  coordinated  and  sustainable  economic  and  social\ndevelopment be realized and a harmonious society built. In recent years, the\nGovernment has taken macro control measures to deal with such issues as\noverinvestment,  overdevelopment,  slow  growth  in  farmers\u2019  income,  and\nunderemployment. These measures have had some effect, but they have not\nsucceeded in rooting out the problems and conflicts. These will be a constant\nheadache in our drive for coordinated and sustainable social and economic\ndevelopment  and  a  harmonious  society. The  central  Government  must\ntherefore strengthen its macro control.\n\nThe Government must exert not only macroeconomic control but also\nmacro social control and regulation, i.e., keep a mutually beneficial relationship\nbetween social classes and ensure the openness of and equal access to social\nclasses. Mutual benefits between classes reflect the principle of fairness, i.e.,\nhigher social classes shall not benefit at the expense of lower social classes. On\nthe contrary, as the interests of the higher social classes are better served, the\nwelfare of the lower social classes should also improve. Moreover, all citizens\nenjoy equal rights. While their status may vary because of political, economic,\ncultural, and social differences, class and status are not fixed, and no groups\nshould be excluded. Government will formulate and implement a fair social\npolicy to break down the barriers between social classes. There will be openness\nbetween and equal access to social classes, and upward and sideways mobility.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nPlenary 1.pmd\n\n22\n\n20/11/2006, 3:10 PM\n\n\fDemocratization and State Capacity in East and Southeast Asia\n\n23\n\nOnly in this way will the society be resilient, fairer, more dynamic and creative,\nand harmonious.\n\nFifth, government should effectively supervise the society. A harmonious\nsociety is stable and orderly. In the process of modernization, social order and\nharmony do not happen without human intervention. A social supervision\nsystem must be established and improved to effectively supervise, manage,\nand  control  the  society,  and  to  ensure  social  order  and  humane  dealings.\nGovernment makes laws and regulations to steer social and economic activities\nand to safeguard social order.\n\nTo  build  a  harmonious  society  and  strengthen  social  supervision,\nmanagement,  and  control,  a  public  crisis  management  system  must  be\nestablished  with  government  at  the  center.  We  must  clearly  define  the\nresponsibilities  and  authority  of  governments  in  the  lawful  handling  of\nunforeseen public crises, strengthen the public crisis management system, and\nformulate and constantly improve a plan for dealing with unforeseen public\nemergencies. The aim is to minimize harm and loss from unforeseen events\nand prevent them from causing social unrest.\n\nThe Need for Functional Transformation in Government\nand Better Capability to Build a Harmonious Society\n\nWe  have  made  important  progress  after  more  than  20  years  of\nadministrative reform. But some deep-rooted problems remain, and reform is\nstill a painstaking task.\n\nAt present, the major problems in the administrative system of the PRC\n\nare:\n\n(cid:127) Governments are still in charge of many things that they should have\nno hand in, that they are unable to manage, or that they are unable to\nmanage well. Many things still need administrative approval.\nSome local governments still make decisions for companies, attract\ninvestment away from companies, or interfere in the production and\nbusiness affairs of companies.\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127) The social management and public service functions of government\n\nmust be strengthened.\n\n(cid:127) The government structure needs to be rationalized. Functions overlap\nand  responsibilities  are  not  clearly  defined,  responsibility  is  often\ndivorced from authority, management is unenlightened, and there is\nmuch inefficiency.\n\n(cid:127) Performance assessment is not methodical.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nPlenary 1.pmd\n\n23\n\n20/11/2006, 3:10 PM\n\n\f24\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nThese problems not only hinder economic and social development but\nalso  the  capability  of  the  Government  to  build  a  harmonious  society. To\nimprove this capability, the Government needs to deepen administrative reform\nand speed up functional transformation.\n\nFirst, we shall clearly define the jurisdiction of governments at various\nlevels, and require governments to take good care of the things within their\njurisdiction  and  to  leave  to  others  whatever  is  outside  their  jurisdiction.\nGovernments shall further strengthen their public management and public\nservice function, direct public resources (such as human, material, and financial\nresources) to public service and public management, focus their leadership on\nsocial undertakings and the task of building a harmonious society, further\nimprove  the  handling  of  public  emergencies,  and  enhance  government\ncapability to safeguard public safety and deal with unforeseen events.\n\nSecond,  governments  shall  reform  their  social  management  system\naccording to the principle of separation of governmental and nongovernmental\nfunctions, and of the functions of government from those of the enterprise.\nGovernments  shall  standardize  the  status,  functions,  and  activities  of\ngrassroots organizations; safeguard their lawful rights; apply the principle\nof  respect  for  labor,  knowledge,  talent,  and  creativity;  break  down  the\nstructural barriers to social development and progress; and strengthen creativity\nand dynamism to make our society not only orderly and harmonious, but\nalso full of life and vigor.\n\nThird, we shall further streamline and optimize the government structure\naccording to the principles of simplicity, consistency, efficiency, and the rule\nof law. We shall reduce administrative levels; clarify jurisdictions; and establish\na system of public administration with clear jurisdictions, a rational structure,\nand orderly operation, and constantly improve the system so that governments\ncan accurately and swiftly implement the public will, effectively administer\npublic affairs, and become better able to build a harmonious society.\n\nFourth,  we  shall  establish  a  rational  system  for  assessing  government\nperformance,  institute  greater  openness  in  government,  speed  up  the\ndevelopment  of  a  government  of  service  and  the  rule  of  law,  standardize\ngovernment authority and actions according to law, improve democratic and\nrational decision making, establish efficient and smooth execution, and make\nthe government truly fair, incorruptible, efficient, and concerned about the\npeople\u2019s welfare.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nPlenary 1.pmd\n\n24\n\n20/11/2006, 3:10 PM\n\n\fSession 1\nEnlarging Citizen Participation\nand Increasing Autonomy\nof Local Government in Achieving\nSocietal Harmony\n\n(cid:102) On the Organizational Framework for Citizens\u2019 Participation\n\nin the People\u2019s Republic of China\nCHU SONGYAN\n\n(cid:102) Qualitative Participation and Social Harmony: A Study\nof the Literacy Movement in West Bengal (India)\nRABINDRANATH BHATTACHARYYA\n\n(cid:102) Enlarging Entrepreneurial Networks of Local Citizens\n\nin Backward Regions of India\nAMITA SINGH\n\n(cid:102) Local Governance, Decentralization, and Participatory\n\nPlanning in Indonesia: Seeking a New Path\nto a Harmonious Society\nIDA WIDIANINGSIH\n\n(cid:102) Citizens\u2019 Participation in Local Budgeting:\n\nThe Case of Mongolia\nBYAMBAYAR YADAMSUREN\n\n(cid:102) Relationship between the Size of Local Government\n\nand Citizen Participation in Sri Lanka\nM.

In the private sector, resources are deployed\nand risks avoided through companies, while in the public sector these same\npurposes are achieved through the government bureaucracy. People also form\ncivil society organizations (CSOs) such as clubs, associations, and unions to\nmeet their needs and enrich their lives. As the 20th century drew to a close,\nscholars heralded the \u201cglobal associational revolution\u201d (Salamon 1999), led in\ndifferent  countries  by  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  nonprofit\norganizations (NPOs), the \u201cthird sector,\u201d the voluntary sector. Therefore, stock\ncompanies, government, and civil society organizations make up the social\ngovernance structure.\n\nIn the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the private sector is relatively\nmature, after more than 20 years of openness and reform. The bureaucracy is\nundergoing reform. The CSOs are growing more and more rapidly, and are\ngradually becoming an important organizational option for people wanting\nto express and advance their interests. However, many factors still hinder public\nsupport for the social governance structure.\n\nPolitical Participation of Social Organizations\n\nCSOs come in three categories in the PRC: social organizations, privately\nrun  non-enterprise  units,  and  foundations.  Each  category  has  its  own\nregulations. According to the Regulation on the Registration and Management\nof  Social  Organizations  passed  in  1998,  social  organizations  (SOs)  are\nvoluntary, non-profit organizations of citizens formed to articulate common\nchoices and decisions.\n\nGrowth of Social Organizations\n\nThe  Regulation  sets  strict  conditions  for  social  organizations  to  be\nregistered as legal entities. Organizations that do not meet the requirements\nare not legal organizations, though such organizations far outnumber those\n\n1 Associate  Professor,  Department  of  Political  Science,  China  National  School  of  Administration,\n\nBeijing, PRC.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n27\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f28\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nregistered. Though  it  would  be  much  more  impressive  to  cover  all  social\norganizations regardless of their registration status, it is rather difficult to make\nout their exact number. Therefore, the social organizations referred to in this\npaper are the registered ones.\n\nThe growth of SOs in the PRC coincides with the period of openness\nand reform, marked by government\u2019s withdrawal from both the market and\nsociety. \u201cOne notable feature of the reform program sponsored by the Chinese\nCommunist Party (CCP),\u201d Professor Saich (2000) pointed out, \u201chas been the\nexpansion  of  social  organizations.\u201d  Before  1978,  social  organizations  were\nquite  limited  in  variety  and  numbers:  there  were  fewer  than  100  national\nSOs, and only slightly more than 6,000 local SOs nationwide (Kang Xiaoguang\n1999). The adoption of the policy of openness and reform spurred activity\namong traditional SOs and led to the rapid emergence of new types of SOs.\nBy the end of 2004, around 153,000 SOs were registered nationwide.\n\nSOs have gone through four stages of development since 1978. Stage\none (1978\u20131988) was the period of rapid growth. At this stage, there were no\nrules or regulations on social organization, as reform had just begun. Social\norganizations were managed by nearly every public agency. Their exact number\nwas therefore difficult to determine, but the number was generally believed to\nbe huge, compared with the number in later stages. In 1989, there were around\n209,400 registered SOs.\n\nStage  two  (1989\u20131992)  was  the  cleaning-up  period.  As  the  social\norganizations rapidly increased, it became necessary and important to manage\nthem through registration. On 25 October 1989, the first Regulation on the\nRegistration  and  Management  of  Social  Organizations  was  passed.  It\nestablished  the  dual  management  model  and  introduced  the  system  of\nregistration.  On  9 June 1990, the State Council issued a notice requiring\nlocal  governments  to  inventory  all  SOs.  From  then  on,  SO  statistics  were\nincluded in national statistics. By 1992, the number of registered SOs had\ndecreased dramatically to 154,500.\n\nStage  three  (1993\u20131998)  was  the  period  of  steady  growth.  With  the\nsocialist  market  economy  as  the  established  goal  of  economic  reform,\nprofessional and economic research organizations thrived. However, as social\norganizations  were  under-regulated\u2014there  was  still  only  one  regulation\ngoverning  them\u2014some  illegal  groups  acted  to  the  discredit  of  social\norganizations and caused harm to social stability. Therefore, the No. 22 File\nissued  by  the  State  Council  in  1996  required  strict  supervision  of  social\norganizations by both central government agencies and local governments.\nSOs decreased in number, but their governance structure improved.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n28\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fOn the Organizational Framework for Citizens\u2019 Participation in the PRC\n\n29\n\nStage four (since September 1998) is the regulating and nurturing period.\nOn  25  September  1998,  the  revised  Regulation  on  the  Registration  and\nManagement  of  Social  Organizations  was  passed,  and  some  measures  to\nencourage registration, such as lowering the requirements for local SOs, were\nadopted. However, in 1999, the illegal activities of the Falun Gong movement\nexposed weaknesses in the management of SOs. There followed a second round\nof housecleaning and a further decline in the number of SOs. As the weaknesses\nwere gradually dealt with, SOs resumed their slow yet steady growth in 2001.\nFigure  1  shows  the  fluctuations  in  the  number  of  SOs  from  year  to  year,\nreflecting the development of SO regulation by government since the passage\nof  the  first  Regulation  on  the  Registration  and  Management  of  Social\nOrganizations in 1989.\n\nTo understand the development of social organizations in the PRC, we\nsurveyed three provincial areas from 2002 to 2004.

Although  the  participation  of  social  organizations  has  not\nbeen an equalizing factor in politics, it has become an inevitable factor in\npublic policy making. Growing under the watchful eye of government and\nwith its encouragement, social organizations are now \u201cplaying the role the\ngovernment wishes [them to play in] ways the government wishes\u201d (Lu Jianhua\n2000)  in  policy  making  and  the  management  of  social  affairs. They  are\nbecoming an important bridge between government and the citizens. On the\none hand, they are helping to democratize policy making by articulating the\ncitizens\u2019  interests.  On  the  other  hand,  by  conveying  government\u2019s  policy\nintentions and wishes to their members and the public, social organizations\nare promoting understanding and communication.\n\nPolitical participation by social organizations in the PRC is, however,\nquite  limited  at  present.  A  survey  by  the  Zhejiang  Bureau  of  Civil  Affairs\nshows that only about 17% of business associations have actually influenced\nlocal government to stop or modify policies (Sun Jinxia 2005). Our survey\ncame up with a similar ratio of respondent SOs who believed that their opinions\nhad had a strong effect on certain policies. Another aspect shows the limited\ninfluence of SOs. The survey question \u201cDo you think that your organization\nis considered an important factor by the government and officials?\u201d drew a yes\nanswer from 67.9% of respondent SOs in Beijing, 64.5% of those in Zhejiang,\nand  64.9%  of  SOs  in  Heilongjiang.  But  only  16.8%  (411  of  the  2,445)\nrespondent social organizations surveyed said that they had strongly influenced\ngovernment decision making. This inconsistency reflects the awkward status\nof  SOs:  while  they  aspire  to  be  involved,  they  feel  powerless  to  influence\ngovernment.\n\nGovernment  decides  how  far  social  organizations  can  participate  in\ngovernment and what effect their participation will have. At present, reform\nin the PRC is still government-dominated. This means that government, relying\non traditional skills and measures, still controls information and service delivery.\nSOs are not considered important information channels and service delivery\npartners. Therefore, they are merely passive and cannot fully express and defend\ntheir  interests.  Meanwhile,  conflicting  interests  and  competition  are\nproliferating in the PRC. Government is faced with the major challenge of\nharmonizing these different interests by promoting the political participation\nof social organizations. The challenge has two aspects. On the one hand, the\nrole of social organizations as the main avenue of interest expression and social\ngovernance should be emphasized and encouraged. On the other hand, social\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n31\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f32\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\norganizations should be guided toward public interest goals so that they are\nnot  exploited  by  a  few. Therefore,  government  must  regulate  SOs  while\nnurturing them, that is, it must consider encouraging social organizations to\nmediate between conflicting interests, and at the same time design mechanisms\nto keep social organizations from being controlled by a minority.\n\nTable 1: Influence of Social Organizations on Government Decision Making\n\nInfluence on Government Decisions\n\nBeijing\n\nZhejiang\n\nHeilongjiang\n\nTotal\n\n(%)\n\n1.1\n\n6.3\n7.6\n40.0\n22.6\n22.4\n\n527\n627\n\n0.3\n\n8.6\n7.8\n45.7\n19.1\n18.6\n\n1,532\n1,782\n\n1.0\n\n10.9\n8.3\n44.6\n15.8\n19.4\n\n386\n449\n\n0.6\n\n8.4\n7.8\n44.3\n19.3\n19.6\n\n2,445\n2,858\n\nVery strong\n\nModerately strong\nStrong\nNot strong\nNo influence\nHard to say\n\nRespondents\nTotal Surveyed\n\nNote: Percentage figures represent proportions of valid responses, not of the total surveyed.\n\nThe Development of Social Organizations:\nNurturing while Regulating\n\nAs is well known, the development of SOs follows the phase of reform.\nThe  reform  process,  because  it  is  so  uneven,  both  favors  and  restricts  the\ngrowth  of  SOs. Traditional  state  institutions  still  dominate,  squeezing  the\nsurvival space of SOs. Among the SOs we surveyed, 70.4% complained of\nbeing dependent on government initiative. Since funds are in short supply\namong SOs and government is still the most important source, some researchers\nhave predicted that \u201cthe [growth] of SOs\u2019 activities mainly [depends] on the\ndeepening of reform and the growth of the market\u201d (Wang Ying, Zhe Xiaoye,\nand Sun Bingyao 1993). This is not enough, however. Since the reform is still\ngovernment-dominated, a new model for the development of SOs\u2014nurturing\nwhile regulating\u2014must be adopted.\n\nThe  Regulation  on  the  Registration  and  Management  of  Social\nOrganizations,  passed  in  1998,  is  now  being  amended  in  response  to  the\nchallenge of social governance. But the present management system is still\nfocused mainly on registering social organizations, and a complete institutional\nframework for the management of social organizations has yet to be established.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n32\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fOn the Organizational Framework for Citizens\u2019 Participation in the PRC\n\n33\n\nGenerally speaking, for social organizations to function properly\u2014for them\nto represent capably the shared interests of their members, collaborate in social\ngovernance, and enhance and preserve social welfare, complementing the state-\nmarket-society allocation of social resources and risks\u2014an institutional structure\nfor establishing, registering, governing, regulating and supervising, raising funds,\nobtaining preferential tax treatment, etc., for social organizations should be\nbuilt up step by step. Social organizations are freedom of association in practice,\nand they take various forms. A registered, legal entity is only one such form. A\nlarge number of social organizations in all countries do not meet the registration\nstandards. But registered social organizations do have easier access to tax benefits\nand government contracts, and derive legitimacy from legislation.\n\nTo nurture social organizations while regulating them, government must\nguarantee their independence while making sure that they are not for profit\nand nonpolitical, and do not harm the public interest. Independence prevents\nsocial  organizations  from  being  restricted,  especially  by  government,  from\nexpressing  their  opinions  freely. The  not-for-profit  principle  sets  social\norganizations apart from profit-oriented companies, while being nonpolitical\ndifferentiates them from political parties, and guarantees their reasonable and\nlawful participation. The principle of not causing harm to the public interest\nallows social organizations to represent specific interests that do not run counter\nto the general interest.\n\nAt present, the PRC needs to resolve various issues at the institutional\n\nlevel.\n\nRegulation of Social Organizations Based on Classification\n\nSocial organizations can be divided into mutual benefit organizations\n(MBOs) and public benefit organizations (PBOs) according to their interests,\nand further into those with legal status and those without. The Regulation on\nthe  Registration  and  Management  of  Social  Organizations  applies  only  to\nsocial organizations with legal status. Many social organizations that do not\nmeet the registration criteria are excluded, though they continue to exist by\nvirtue of the freedom of association. However, they are generally underfunded\nand do not have the legal identity to participate in public affairs, thus increasing\nthe possibility of conflicts between competing interests.\n\nThe growth in social organizations enhances social governance and public\nservices. To allow social organizations to carry out their social responsibilities,\na distinction must first be made between PBOs and MBOs, and different\nregulations set for each group. After that, the registration requirements can be\nretained as the standard for legal entities, while those social organizations that\ndo not meet the requirements are also put on record. Such organizations could\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n33\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f34\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nsend  their  organization  details  to  the  supervising  agency  by  post,  and  the\nagency could publicize the name lists of these social organizations regularly,\nso that the public knows of their existence and can decide what to do about\nthem. Moreover, such records enable the State to understand better the activities\nand  functions  of  social  organizations  and  to  consider  their  interests  when\nmaking public decisions and social development strategies.\n\nNeed for Change in the Dual Management System\n\nTo  guarantee  the  independence  of  social  organizations,  the  dual\nmanagement system must be reformed. The dual management system makes\nthe Department of Civil Affairs the registration agency while entrusting the\nactual management of the organizations to professional responsible authorities.\nIn this arrangement, the professional responsible authorities must be Party\nentities,  government  agencies,  or  other  authorized  bodies. The  Regulation\ngives them unlimited power to supervise the social organizations. Under this\nsystem,  it  is  difficult  for  social  organizations  to  be  independent  from\ngovernment and to protect their members\u2019 interests.\n\nIn  reality,  however,  the  Regulation  only  requires  the  professional\nresponsible authorities to review the registration files of the social organizations\nand to guide their activities within the legal framework, and does not specify\nprocedures for the professional responsible authorities to follow. As a result,\nsome  professional  responsible  authorities  simply  see  to  it  that  social\norganizations  are  registered.  Other  professional  responsible  authorities,\nhowever, regard social organizations as their departments or adjuncts. The\nsocial  organizations  lose  their  independence  this  way.  On  the  other  hand,\nsome professional responsible authorities could also become too immersed in\nthe interests of specific \u201cdepartments.\u201d Moreover, although the Regulation\nplaces social organizations under professional responsible authorities, it absolves\nthe latter of any legal responsibility for violations by social organizations under\ntheir charge; the legal burden falls solely on the social organizations. Hence,\nthe  legal  relationship  between  the  social  organization  and  its  professional\nresponsible  authority  is  an  amorphous  one. The  professional  responsible\nauthority can neither regulate nor nurture the social organization effectively.\nGetting  rid  of  the  dual  management  system  and  strengthening  the\ninstitutional  arrangement  for  the  supervision  of  independent  social\norganizations is an operational choice that must accord with the reality.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n34\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fOn the Organizational Framework for Citizens\u2019 Participation in the PRC\n\n35\n\nNeed for Written Supervision Procedures\n\nThe supervision of social organizations revolves around their governance\nstructure and fund-raising activities. Social organizations derive their income\nfrom membership fees, endowments from citizens and companies, and legal\ncharges  for  services,  but,  because  of  a  lack  of  connection  between  their\nmanagement  and  the  tax  system,  these  organizations  receive  very  little\nendowment and not much more in grants from government (see Table 2).\n\nTable 2: Sources of Income of Social Organizations, 2000\n\nSource\n\nBeijing\n\nZhejiang\n\nHeilongjiang\n\nTotal\n\n(%)\n\n22.0\n37.9\n15.5\n17.7\n6.9\n\n1,183\n1,782\n\n23.6\n33.6\n11.8\n23.4\n7.6\n\n362\n627\n\nGovernment grants\nMembership fees\nAll endowments\nService incomes\nOther\n\nRespondents\nTotal Surveyed\n\n20.7\n43.2\n8.1\n16.8\n11.3\n\n258\n449\n\n22.2\n37.8\n13.7\n18.7\n7.7\n\n1,803\n2,858\n\nNote: Percentage figures represent proportions of valid responses, not of the total surveyed.\n\nIndividuals and companies are entitled to tax exemption when they donate\nto PBOs such as charities, but without feasible procedures for realizing the tax\nexemption, they are not so willing to donate. Likewise, membership fees can\nhardly keep the organizations afloat with the strict regulation by the Civil\nAffairs Department, which holds down the fees. Hence, offering services for\nmoney  becomes  an  important  way  for  social  organizations  to  stay  alive.\nAccording to our survey, many social organizations now stay in existence by\nholding all kinds of exhibitions and fairs. Others have dwindled to little more\nthan an excuse for the members to establish and keep friendships.\n\nOver the near, as well as the longer term, therefore, better tax laws should\nbe passed and other institutional arrangements made to secure the survival of\nsocial organizations and facilitate their supervision. The financial affairs of\nsocial organizations\u2014statements of income and expenses, balance sheets, etc.\u2014\nshould be reported promptly to their members, and made known regularly to\nthe public, and so should their activities. The reports should be made available\nin easily accessible public places.\n\nThe  Regulation  stipulates  that  there  should  be  only  one  social\norganization  in  each  social  area  at  each  administrative  level.  Many  social\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n35\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f36\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\norganizations have ways of getting around this prohibition, sometimes using\ndifferent names and different categories of activity to achieve the purpose.\nWhat is important is that social organizations are growing, and it is hard to\nsay which ones are stronger or more representative. So the Regulation must be\nchanged to encourage more social organizations to register by guaranteeing\ntheir members the freedom to join and withdraw from the organizations. The\ngoal is to develop moderate competition to strengthen social organizations.\nBut building a perfect institutional framework in a short time is not so\neasy. For now, we can make incremental changes in laws and regulations in\ndifferent areas to nurture social organizations while regulating them.\n\nInstitutional Framework and Feasible Mechanisms\n\nModern organizations seek opportunities for political participation to\npursue a wide variety of interests. In the PRC, as reform and transformation\nproceeds,  \u201cgroup  interests\u2019  influence  [on]  politics  will  be  more  and  more\n[significant].... Consequently, to regulate interests of different groups and keep\n[the] interest balance at [a] certain level will be an important aspect of political\npractice\u201d  (Li  Jingpeng  1995,  page  10).  Political  participation  by  social\norganizations  should  therefore  follow  some  principles,  and  an  appropriate\ninstitutional framework needs to be established to ensure a more inclusive\npolitical process.\n\nPrinciples of Political Participation by Social Organizations\n\nThe participation of social organizations in political life should follow\nseveral  principles.  First,  the  public  interest  should  dominate.  Social\norganizations express their interests through various participation channels at\nevery phase of public decision making, to influence policy. Many developed\ncountries such as the UK and the USA require social organizations to follow\nthe principle of public interest in participating in public decision making on\neducation, research, etc. As the PRC is still undergoing social transformation,\nit is especially important that mutual benefit organizations and public benefit\norganizations participate in political process with a public-interest orientation.\nThis helps the State to judge the demands of different social organizations,\nbalance different interests, and mediate between conflicting interests. The social\norganizations, for their part, are able to connect the realization of their interests\nto the realization of the public interest. In the process, public-spirited citizens\nare formed.\n\nSecond,  the  principle  of  legitimacy  and  reasonability  prevents  public\npolicy issues from being monopolized by a few powerful social organizations.\nAs political participants, social organizations should not be exempted from\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n36\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fOn the Organizational Framework for Citizens\u2019 Participation in the PRC\n\n37\n\nlaws and legal principles. They must cooperate as well as compromise with\nother organizations with competing interests.\n\nFinally,  the  principle  of  nondiscrimination  applies  not  only  to  social\norganizations but also to government. Powerful organizations are usually better\nable to make adequate use of the various channels for expressing their interests,\nwhile ordinary, and especially weaker organizations use expression channels\ntoo little, for lack of financial support and skills. Government should treat\nsocial organizations equally, making sure that they have equal opportunities\nto express their demands and that more powerful social organizations do not\nencroach on the public interest.\n\nTherefore, not only must social organizations be brought into the political\nparticipation framework, but participation channels must be widened and\nfeasible institutional mechanisms innovated.\n\nFirst, social organizations should be able to represent and express their\nmembers\u2019 interests more openly in the social and political process. People are\nthe masters of the State. This is the basic principle of the PRC\u2019s political life,\nembodied in the election of representative organs of the State, as well as in\ncitizens\u2019 participation, whether direct or indirect, in public affairs. Moreover,\nas  the  basic  social  units  allocating  resources  and  risks,  social  organizations\ncontribute to the balance of social governance. In the PRC, there is no lack of\nchannels for expressing various interests in politics and governance. What is\nlacking is a way of making these various channels of expression more accessible\nthrough  concrete  institutional  arrangements  and  procedures  so  that  social\norganizations can participate in public decision making.\n\nSecond, public decision making should involve social organizations to\nencourage citizens\u2019 involvement in public concerns. For democratic decision\nmaking, social organizations should be involved at each stage of the process.\nPublic  hearings,  symposiums,  and  other  forums  are  necessary  for  decision\nmakers  to  make  sense  of  different,  often  conflicting,  opinions.  The\nimplementation of decisions is also a continuing process that requires constant\nexchange of information between government and citizens. The participation\nof  social  organizations  can  also  help  strengthen  the  relations  between\ngovernment and citizens, and improve citizens\u2019 political awareness. In some\nlocalities, deliberations on public issues and the participation of environmental\norganizations in environmental policy making, among other measures, are\ncontributing to the design of a framework for mediating between conflicting\ninterests and keeping the public trust.\n\nFinally, public affairs, especially at the community level, should be open\nto participation by social organizations. Such participation conforms to the\nrule  of  law  and  the  protection  of  citizenship  rights,  and  is  one  aspect  of\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n37\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f38\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\ndemocratization. At present, social organizations are relatively active in social\naffairs, especially in urban communities, but participate less, and ineffectively,\nin state political affairs. The Lawmaking Act requires lawmakers to hear the\nopinions of a broad spectrum of society when drafting legislation. But concrete\nprocedures are still under consideration.\n\nConclusion\n\nA harmonious society needs a strong state, a strong private sector, and a\nstrong society, as well as some kind of collaboration among the three. Though\nthe PRC is becoming richer and stronger, there is no equilibrium between the\nthree spheres: the State is too strong, the private sector is just gaining strength,\nand the society is still weak. Social organizations have been growing rapidly in\nrecent years, and a flourishing and free society is an increasingly likely prospect.\nYet the road to social harmony is still a long one.\n\nWidening social organizations\u2019 participation can not only inspire citizens\nto give greater attention to public concerns and then strengthen their awareness\nof government and its activities, it can also lead to stronger citizens and a\nstronger state. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an institutional framework\nto support such participation. The Regulation and other related institutions\neither lack feasibility or conflict with one another. Institutions and laws must\nbe developed to promote the growth of social organizations while regulating\nthem.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n38\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fOn the Organizational Framework for Citizens\u2019 Participation in the PRC\n\n39\n\nReferences\n\nKang Xiaoguang. 1999.

Since democratic\nideas gained popularity, theorists have tried to establish congruence between\nformal democracy, in the form of a constitution for popular government, and\nreal  democracy,  in  the  sense  of  qualitative  participation  by  the  people  in\ngovernment. But political theorists and political sociologists differ greatly in\ntheir  views  about  the  nature  and  extent  of  such  congruence,  especially  in\nIndia. The democratic process in India since independence has followed a\npolitical sequence of its own. But throughout this journey toward democracy,\nsome issues have continued to block the sought-for congruence between formal\nand  real  democracy.  One  such  issue  is  low  literacy,  which  has  hampered\nparticipation in two ways: (i) it has impeded the development of the rationality\nthat  is  required  for  qualitative  participation,  to  better  understand  the\nperspectives and needs of others and seek solutions to accommodate as far as\npossible the needs and interests of all; and (ii) it has helped maintain, if not\nfacilitate, social cohesions along with primordial loyalties to language, religion,\ncaste,  and  ethnic  groups  in  a  way  that  has  blocked  social  harmony  and\nhampered the extension of political citizenship through active participation\nin government. In India, participation at the village-level panchayati raj2 is\none means of participation in the larger democratic system that is relatively\naccessible to the disadvantaged and facilitates the participation of the people\nin decisions governing their lives, the public accountability of their leaders,\nand the equitable distribution of power.\n\nThis paper explores the link between increased literacy and the increased\ncompetence of citizens to participate in the decision-making structures of the\nrural local government, the gram panchayats.\n\n1 Head of the Department of Political Science, The University of Burdwan, West Bengal, India.\n2 A unique grassroots rural self-governing institutional set-up for democratic decentralization.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n40\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fQualitative Participation and Social Harmony: The Literacy Movement in West Bengal (India)\n\n41\n\nThe Notion of Qualitative Participation\n\nParticipation is a social process wherein people exercise their collective\ninitiative in an organized framework to promote their self-perceived interests\nthrough means over which they can exert effective control. The body politic is\nonly a metaphor, but communal action is a fundamental fact of social life.\nHence, the proper approach to participatory democracy is to consider the\nways in which social beings do things together.\n\nNot only do the social beings act in common, but individual acts are\nsubject to rules of ownership as complicated as the laws of property. A society\nwill seem to itself to be much more participant if the actions performed by\nofficials  are  seen  as  being  done  at  its  instigation  and  for  its  sake,  and  are\ntherefore accepted by the people as being, in some extended sense, of their\nown. This is largely a matter of social psychology, but it is grounded in the\npeculiar logic of the concept of action.\n\nThis action cannot be merely proclaimed, however; it has to be promoted.\nIn  ideal  harmonious  living,  collective  decisions  do  not  result  merely  by\naggregating the desires of the members of the polity. Rather, the participants\nattempt to influence each other\u2019s opinion in a rational manner and they strive\nto understand the perspectives and needs of others and seek solutions that\naccommodate as far as possible the needs and interests of all. This requires\ncompetence on the part of the participants.\n\nLong ago J. S. Mill (1861) attempted to combine these two contradictory\nvalues of participation and competence. He opined that the \u201cgoodness of a\ngovernment\u201d depends on (i) the degree to which \u201cit is adapted to take advantage\nof the amount of good qualities\u201d in the governed that exist at any particular\ntime; and (ii) the degree to which \u201cit tends to increase the sum of good qualities\nin the governed.\u201d The first criterion refers to what may be called the protective\ngoal, since Mill would consider government satisfactory to the extent that its\ninstitutions protect the interests of citizens and the general interest. The second\ncriterion (for Mill the more important one) is what may be termed the educative\ngoal, because it deals with government as \u201can agency of national education.\u201d\nApplying these two criteria, Mill in effect invoked two principles. The principle\nof  participation  requires  the  participation  of  each  citizen  to  be  as  great  as\npossible to promote both the protective and educative goals of government.\nMill\u2019s arguments for extensive participation appeal to the need to protect the\ninterests of each citizen and to improve the political intelligence of all citizens.\nThe principle of competence, on the other hand, stipulates that the influence\nof the more qualified citizens should be as great as possible to promote both\nthe protective and educative goals. Here Mill appeals to the need for competent\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n41\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f42\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nleadership to protect against the dangers of ignorance and sinister interests in\nthe government and among the public, and to contribute to the process of\ncivic education.\n\nAlthough the two principles set the same goals, they call for different\nmeans to realize these goals and therefore often conflict with each other. The\nprinciple of participation constrains the principle of competence, just as the\nlatter principle limits the former. Qualitative participation in effect upholds\na judicious admixture of the two principles, emphasizing the participation\nof the maximum number of competent people in the structures of decision\nmaking. Hence, for qualitative participation, education remains an essential\ncriterion.\n\nExperience of West Bengal\n\n\u201cFreedoms are, thus, among the principal means as well as the primary\n\nends of development,\u201d Dreze and Sen (2002) observe. They add:\n\nSimilarly, illiteracy and what Nehru called, more generally, \u201cignorance,\u201d\ninvolve not only a negation of the freedom to read and write, but also an\nimpairment of the opportunity to understand and communicate, to take\ninformed personal decisions, and to participate in social choice. Illiteracy is,\nin fact, a type of \u201csocial unfreedom\u201d and supplements and often intensifies the\nburden of economic unfreedom in the form of income poverty. (pages 4\u20135)\n\nLike most other Asian countries, India up to the time of independence\nhad  been  suffering  from  low  literacy,  which  had  kept  Indians  from  being\naware of their sociopolitical and economic condition. According to the Press\nRelease (6 September 2003) of the Ministry of Human Resource Development\nInformation Bureau of India.\n\nWhen India gained independence, four out of five of her citizens could\nnot read.\u2026 The fast growth in literacy in the recent decades even in the\nface of huge additions to the population depicts a remarkable positive trend.\nAt the same time, we cannot lose sight of the fact that India still have  (sic)\na long way to go towards the goal of total literacy. Out of about 87 crore3\nilliterate  adults  in  the  world,  30  crore  are  Indians.

Table 1 gives data on literacy rates from 1951 to 2001,\ndisaggregated according to gender.\n\nIndia\u2019s perception of literacy varied over time. But with the birth of the\nNational Literacy Mission in 1988, the perception of literacy, its definition\nand norms, reflected the objectives of functional literacy (National Literacy\nMission 1994). The initial phase of the literacy movement was marked by a\nTotal  Literacy  Campaign  (TLC). The TLC  model  was  area-specific,  time-\nbound, volunteer-based, cost-effective, and outcome-oriented. Its goal was\nfunctional literacy, through prescribed literacy norms. Functional literacy not\nonly refers to reading and writing skills but also touches on all other issues of\ndevelopment  such  as  health,  population  growth,  family  welfare,  women\u2019s\nempowerment, and, most important of all, employment.\n\nTable 1: Literacy Rates in India, 1951\u20132001\n(%)\n\nCensus Year\n\nAll Persons\n\nMales\n\nFemales\n\nMale-Female Literacy Gap\n\n1951\n1961\n1971\n1981\n1991\n2001\n\n18.33\n28.30\n34.45\n43.57\n52.21\n65.38\n\n27.16\n40.40\n45.96\n56.38\n64.13\n75.85\n\n8.86\n15.35\n21.97\n29.76\n39.29\n54.16\n\n18.30\n25.05\n23.98\n26.62\n24.84\n21.70\n\nNote: Literacy rates for the 1951, 1961, and 1971 census years relate to the population aged 5 years and above, while those\nfor the 1981, 1991, and 2001 census years relate to the population 7 years and above.\n\nSource: Department of Education Web site (citing Manpower Profile: India, published by the Institute of Applied Manpower\nResearch, New Delhi).\n\nWest Bengal, a constituent state in the east of India, has been ruled by a\nLeft-Front government since 1977. According to the West Bengal Human\nDevelopment Report 2004 (Government of West Bengal 2004b, pages 4\u20135):\n\nWith  a  population  of  about  82  million  in  2001  according  to  the  2001\nCensus, West Bengal is the fourth most populous state situated in the eastern\nregion of India. Accounting for about 2.7 per cent of India\u2019s area (88,752\nsquare km) but about 7.8 per cent of the country\u2019s population, this state\nranks first in terms of density of 904 per sq km as per the 2001 Census.\u2026\n\nAbout  72  per  cent  of  the  people  live  in  rural  areas.  According  to  the\nPlanning Commission, the proportion of population below the poverty\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n43\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f44\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nline in 1999-2000 in West Bengal was 31.85 per cent. The percentages of\nscheduled caste and scheduled tribe populations are 28.6 and 5.8 respectively\nin the rural areas and 19.9 and 1.5 respectively in the urban areas. Among\nthe minorities, the Muslims are the dominant section and they account for\nabout  28.6  per  cent  of  the  total  population  in  West  Bengal.  The\ncorresponding figures for rural and urban areas were 33.3 per cent and 11.8\nper cent respectively. Further, it may be noted that these three categories,\nnamely SC, ST and Minorities, together account for more than half the\npopulation, and these are also the three poorest groups in rural Bengal.\n\nSince  1977  two  major  sets  of  institutional  changes  have  occurred  in\nWest Bengal. The first consists of land reform, mainly tenancy reform and the\ndistribution of agricultural and homestead land to landless and poor farmers.\nThe second major institutional change is associated with the establishment of\na three-tier system of local government (the panchayat) in accordance with\nthe  73rd  Constitutional  Amendment  Act.  Before  the  73rd  Constitutional\nAmendment Act a two-tier system of governance\u2014federal and state units\u2014\nwas prevalent. With the passage of the act, the third tier, comprising the district,\nblock,  and  village  levels,  came  into  existence,  for  area  planning  and  the\nimplementation of development plans and programs. West Bengal was the\nfirst state in India to establish a real participatory democracy by transferring\nthe decision-making powers from government bureaucracies to the people\nthrough the directly elected panchayati raj institutions.4\n\nAlthough the Total Literacy Campaign in West Bengal started at the\nsame time as the campaign in other states, literacy in West Bengal is still far\nshort of mass literacy. According to census data, 77.0% of males and 59.6%\nof females were literate in 2001. In West Bengal the literacy campaign has\nfour categories: (i) formal education, under which children 5\u20138 years old are\nsent to the institutional system or the primary school; (ii) informal education\n(e.g., the child education program Shishu Shiksha Karmasuchi) for children\nwho remain outside the formal system of education because of socioeconomic\nconstraints; (iii) adult education, for a target group ranging from younger adults\n15\u201330  years  old  up  to  older  adults  above  the  age  of  50;  and  (iv)  women\u2019s\neducation, to put an end to the traditional belief that women are best suited for\ndomestic work and that there is therefore no need to send girl children to school.\n\n4 According to the 73rd Constitution Amendment Act, 1992, of India, [Art. 243 (d)] \u201c \u2018Panchayat\u2019 means an\ninstitution (by whatever name called) of self-government constituted under article 243B, for the rural\nareas.\u201d Panchayati Raj institutions comprise of the elected bodies at the District (Zilla Parishad),\nBlock (Panchayat Samity) and Village (Gram Panchayat) levels.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n44\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fQualitative Participation and Social Harmony: The Literacy Movement in West Bengal (India)\n\n45\n\nTable 2: Literacy Rate in West Bengal and India, 1951\u20132001\n(%)\n\nCensus                               Male\n\nWest Bengal\n\nIndia\n\n                             Female\nWest Bengal\n\nIndia\n\n30.9\n40.3\n42.8\n50.7\n67.8\n77.0\n\n27.2\n40.4\n46.0\n56.4\n64.1\n75.8\n\n11.5\n17.0\n22.4\n30.3\n46.6\n59.6\n\n8.9\n15.4\n22.0\n29.8\n39.3\n54.2\n\nYear\n\n1951\n1961\n1971\n1981\n1991\n2001\n\nSource: Census of India, various volumes; Department of Education Web site.\n\nIt is evident from Table 2 that literacy in West Bengal, especially among\nfemales, has been higher than the rate for all of India in most postindependence\ncensus years. The noticeable jump in the literacy rate between the 1991 and\n2001 census years was a direct result of the Total Literacy Campaign.\n\nThis growth in literacy is backed by growth in primary education (based\non school enrollment and not actual school attendance). But, as viewed by\nV. K. Ramachandran, Madhura Swaminathan, and Vikas Rawal (2003), official\ndata regarding school enrollment in West Bengal are poorer compared with\nthat in other states.\n\nThese data come from school registers, which are created and maintained\nby school staff whose employment depends on the enrolment that they\nregister. The fact that the proportion of pupils enrolled in an age-cohort is\noften larger than the size of the age-cohort itself is the clearest evidence of\nfalse data (page 10).\n\nHence,  while  the  State  Elementary  Education  Report  Card,  2004\n(Mehta 2005, page 25), gave impressive figures for girls\u2019 enrollment in 2004,5\nthe data came from school registers, created and maintained by school staff\nwhose employment depends on the enrollment that they register. The fact\nthat the proportion of pupils enrolled in an age-cohort is often larger than\nthe  size  of  the  age-cohort  itself  is  the  clearest  evidence  of  false  data.\nNevertheless, referring to the NSSO 52nd Round Report No. 439 (52/25.2/1)\nWest Bengal Human Development Report 2004 (Government of West Bengal\n2004b, page 154),  says:\n\n5\n\n49.5% in primary, 51.6% in primary and upper primary, 51.3% in primary and secondary/higher\nsecondary, 57.9% in upper primary, and 46.6% in upper primary and secondary.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n45\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f46\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nattendance rates for boys were generally slightly lower than the all-India\naverage and substantially lower than the best performing state, which is\nKerala, in both urban and rural areas. However, attendance rates for girls\naged 6-10 years in rural West Bengal were generally better than the all-\nIndia average, although in urban areas the rate in West Bengal was slightly\nlower. For girls aged 11-13, attendance rates were higher or the same as the\nall-India average.\n\nThe 1992 Report of the Education Commission of West Bengal provides a\nuseful account of the progress of school education (and primary education in\nparticular) under the Left-Front government.\n\nAccording to the report (Government of West Bengal 1992), there are a\nnumber of reasons for the steep progress of primary education in West Bengal.\nFirst, the number of schools increased, school enrollments increased more than\n80% between 1977 and 1992, and the average distance between schools and\nliving settlements was reduced across the state, especially in the area inhabited\nby the dalits and adivasis 6. Second, all school education was made free throughout\nthe  state. Third,  the  number  of  teachers  increased.  Fourth,  the  government\nimproved the conditions of employment of teachers: their salaries, allowances,\nand  retirement  benefits  rose  substantially  after  the  Left-Front  government\ncame to power. Fifth, textbooks were provided free of charge under certain\nschemes. Sixth, the government of West Bengal introduced a system of automatic\npromotion for the first five years of school. However, the report also noted that\ndropping out is still a major feature of primary education, that the quality of\nteaching has not improved, that \u201cthe system of school inspection has in practice\nbecome defunct,\u201d and that \u201cno real accountability exists anywhere.\u201d\n\nTo sum up, the literacy and school attendance statistics show that progress\nhas been made in West Bengal through the literacy movement. Going by the\nWest Bengal Human Development Report 2004 (Government of West Bengal\n2004b, pages 144\u2013163), this progress has been made especially among the\nscheduled castes, scheduled tribes, and other backward classes. However, the\nobjective of the literacy movement is not simply to enable the person to read,\nwrite, or do simple calculations. The movement was conceived as a dynamic\n\n6 The term Dalits refers to the marginalized sections of the Indian society. The year, in which the term\nwas initiated, in 1939 or in 1956, is a matter of conjecture. As have been observed by the analysts,\nthe term evolved due to the need felt by the untouchables of Maharashtra (a state in India), especially\nthe  Mahars  (a  low  caste)  to  go  beyond  the  Hindu  caste  structure  with  its  sheltering  concept  of\nHarijan (the out-caste people) as used by Gandhi, and also to go beyond the class system defining\nthem as proletariat obliterating their ethno-cultural distinctiveness.  Adivasi means the aboriginal\npeople, the tribal people.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n46\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fQualitative Participation and Social Harmony: The Literacy Movement in West Bengal (India)\n\n47\n\nprogram  of  social  reconstruction  intended  to  develop  untapped  human\nresources. The population covered by the program and the villagers at large\nare expected to be elevated to a new level of consciousness about environmental\nissues,  relations  in  society,  the  role  of  women  in  rural  society,  communal\nharmony or national integration, etc. Such target population of the literacy\nmovement must have the functionality and awareness that are fundamental\nin bringing about a radical change in the society through prior changes in the\nperceptual and motivational world of the individuals concerned.\n\nLiteracy and Participation\n\nThis paper works on the hypothesis that the increase in the rate of literacy\naffects participation by increasing not only its quantity but also its quality.\nFunctional literacy increases awareness among the citizenry, whose participation\nwas  confined  almost  exclusively  to  voting  and  who  had  only  limited\nparticipation in decision making after the elections. Once there is increased\nawareness,  the  principle  of  competence  operates  among  the  citizens  while\nthey participate in the institutional setup. To assess the increase in the quality\nof participation in West Bengal as a result of the increase in literacy, one may\nlook at the participation in the gram sansad7 (village constituency) grassroots\ninstitutional setup of the panchayat system in West Bengal, which has remained\nvery poor since its inception. The gram sansad and gram sabha8  are treated in\nthis paper not as a delivery system of higher level of government but as an\nactive institution of local self-government.\n\nThere are many reasons for the poor participation in gram sansad and\n\ngram sabha meetings:\n\n(cid:127) Voters lack awareness about their role and rights in the gram sansad\n\n(cid:127) The  complex  village  social  structure  prohibits  the  participation  of\n\nand gram sabha.\n\nthe weaker sectors.\n\n7 As far as the West Bengal Panchayat Act of 1973 (as modified up to 31 January 2004, especially by\nthe West Bengal Panchayat [Amendment] Act of 1994) is concerned, \u201cEvery constituency of a Gram\nPanchayat under clause (a) of sub-section (3) of section 4 shall have a Gram Sansad consisting of\npersons whose names are included in the electoral roll of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly for\nthe time being in force pertaining to the area comprised in such constituency of the Gram Panchayat.\u201d\nAnd  \u201cEvery  Gram  shall  have  a  Gram  Sabha  consisting  of  persons  registered  in  the  electoral  roll\npertaining to the area of the Gram.\u201d See in this context art. 16A and 16B of the West Bengal Panchayat\nAct of 1973 as modified up to 31 January 2004, Government of West Bengal, Law Department,\nLegislative, pages 25\u201327. Thus the difference between the gram sansad and the gram sabha is subtle.\n8 According to Art. 243 (b) of the Indian Constitution, \u201c \u2018Gram  Sabha\u2019 means a body consisting of\npersons registered  in the electoral rolls relating to a village comprised within the area of Panchayat\nat the village level\u201d.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n47\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f48\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\n(cid:127) The marginalized sector has been sidelined in decision making.\n(cid:127) Meetings are strongly perceived to be of no use, with decisions made\n\nin the party offices of the ruling party of the panchayat.\n\n(cid:127) Women hesitate to participate actively because of social taboos.\n(cid:127) Decision making is perceived to be the affair of the higher echelons\n\nof the village.\n\n(cid:127) The meeting is held in an inconvenient place.\n\nHowever, most of these reasons are bound to have reduced influence, or\nto  be  totally  negated,  by  the  increase  in  functional  literacy.  In  May  1999,\nGhatak and Ghatak (2002) assessed the attendance and participation at gram\nsansad meetings in a sample of 20 panchayat constituencies located in 14 gram\npanchayats in three districts\u201424 Parganas (N), 24 Parganas (S), and South\nDinajpur. The authors surveyed villagers following recent gram sansad meetings,\nconcerning their participation in these meetings. The overall participation\nrate in these meetings was found to be 12% of all voters, compared with the\n16% reported for West Bengal as a whole. This suggests that one out of every\nseven  or  eight  voters  attended  the  gram  sansad  meetings  (the  minimum\nattendance required for a quorum is one out of ten). Of those attending,\n43%  on  average  were  landless,  41%  were  marginal  or  small  landowners,\nand the remaining 16% were medium or large landowners. The following\ntable, using data from Ghatak and Ghatak (2002, tables 4, 5, and 6), shows\nthe attendance rates:\n\nTable 3: Gram Sansad Attendance Rates\n\n% Attending\n\n% Voters\n\nSector\n\nMen\nWomen\nSC\nST\nMuslims\nLandless\nMarginal and\n\nSmall Landowners\nLeft-Front Political\n\nAffiliation\n\n91\n9\n55\n13\n3\n43\n\n41\n\n67\n\n54\n46\n58\n15\n4\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n65*\n\n\u2014 = not available, SC = scheduled castes, ST = scheduled tribes.\n*% of constituencies secured by Left-Front candidates.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n48\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fQualitative Participation and Social Harmony: The Literacy Movement in West Bengal (India)\n\n49\n\nBut the most important observation of the authors was the improvement\n\nin the quality of the participation.\n\nThe  participants  actively  voice  demand  for  new  projects,  suggest  how\nallocated funds should be spent and debate how projects should be designed.\nThe Pradhan (Chairperson) and the local representatives are questioned\non the progress of implementation of projects, and often face allegations\nabout misuse of funds and selection of beneficiaries. The response of elected\nofficials to these criticisms showed that they could not take the voters present\nat the meeting for granted. In some cases where there was overwhelming\nevidence in favour of the criticisms raised by the people, the village council\nofficials admitted their error\u2026. Sometimes the elected representatives and\nother village council functionaries gave a detailed account of the financial\nsituation  in  respect  of  various  schemes  and  tried  to  explain  their  poor\nperformance in terms of delay of arrival of funds from the state government.\n\nThis represents a marked improvement over the previous situation where\nthe power of the village council (gram panchayat) was totally concentrated\nin the hands of the Pradhan\u2026.The Pradhan\u2019s power could be maintained\nmainly by the fact that the common villagers were not privy to information\nabout the allocation of resources and there was no forum to voice their\nopinions and criticisms. The village constituency meetings seem to be an\nimportant institutional innovation to contribute to the ideal of participatory\ngovernance, although from our study we cannot judge how much of an\neffect it will have in making the allocation of resources responsive to public\ndemand, or improving the implementation of projects. (Ghatak and Ghatak\n2002, page 53)\n\nDiscussions in the 14 gram sansad meetings, according to the Ghatak\nand Ghatak study, revolved around four main issues, showing why competence\nis required for participation: (i) agenda setting (new programs and priorities\nfor gram panchayat spending); (ii) design of future projects; (iii) selection of\nbeneficiaries (of water or housing benefits); and (iv) review and monitoring of\npast and current gram panchayat projects (including location of projects, quality\ncomplaints, and corruption and mismanagement complaints). The account\nof Ghatak and Ghatak suggests a forum that enables genuine and competent\nparticipation by diverse groups in public discussions, leading to a measure of\naccountability of elected members to their constituencies.\n\nAlthough the Ghatak and Ghatak study did take into account the quality\nof participation along with the quantity of attendance, no direct relation has\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n49\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f50\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nbeen established between attendance at village council sessions and the literacy\nrate of the members. That relation is established by an empirical study on the\ngram panchayats of Suri I Block in Birbhum district of West Bengal.9\n\nAfter the Total Literacy Campaign, Birbhum was declared a fully literate\ndistrict in 1992 with a literate population of 1,642,845, or 80.56% of the\npopulation aged 6 years old and above (National Literacy Mission 1993, page\n29). Suri I block consists of seven gram panchayats, namely, Karidhya, Nagari,\nKhatanga, Tilpara, Alunda, Mallickpur, and Bhurkuna. According to the 2001\ncensus, the block has a total population of 96,485\u201449,942 male and 46,543\nfemale. The  number  of  literate  persons  is  51,322,  or  62.98%  of  the  total\npopulation. The male literate persons number 30,805 (72.81%) and the female\nliterate  persons,  20,517  (52.37%). Tables  4  and  5  may  help  establish  the\nconnection between the increase in literacy rate and the increase in the number\nof citizens participating in postelection decisions in gram sabha (bottom level\nof the gram panchayat) and other meetings.\n\nTable 4: Voter Turnout in Panchayat Elections\n\nGram Panchayat\n\nKaridhya\nNagari\nKhatanga\nTilpara\nAlunda\nMallickpur\nBhurkuna\n\n1988\n%\n\n 45.0\n42.0\n 39.0\n 47.0\n 32.0\n 37.0\n 46.5\n\n1993\n%\n\n57.0\n58.0\n55.0\n 53.0\n 48.0\n 46.0\n  53.2\n\n1998\n%\n\n62.0\n 61.0\n59.0\n  56.0\n56.0\n  57.0\n  61.0\n\nSource: Panchayat Parichiti of Birbhum district, 1989, 1994, and 1999.\n\nFrom  the  above  tables  it  may  be  deduced  that  increased  literacy  has\nincreased voter turnout and the average attendance at gram sabha meetings\n(except in Alunda Gram Panchayat). The obvious relation between the increase\nin the rate of literacy and the increase in political awareness is established by\nthe data in Table 6, which show that candidacies in the gram panchayats of\nSuri I Block almost doubled in number between 1988 and 2003, from 118 to\n232.\n\n9 Data were collected for this study by Sudipta Pal in 2003 at Master of Philosophy level under the\n\nsupervision of R.

NGOs,  state  government  departments,  and  the  central\nGovernment have been facilitating the development of SHGs to generate self-\nemployment in the rural areas. SHGs are encouraged to form their own fund,\nand not to go to moneylenders for loans. The groups set up microenterprises\nand arrange direct contacts between self-employed persons (like weavers or\nsmall-scale  food  processors)  and  buyers  in  the  market,  directly  bypassing\nwholesale businessmen. SHGs also develop the capabilities of their members\nto participate effectively in decision making. In fact, throughout West Bengal\nthese groups are sincerely attempting to redistribute wealth and power in a\nnovel way among the poor, especially among the women. According to the\nPanchayat and Rural Development Department (2004a), there were 73,033\nsuch  groups  throughout  West  Bengal  up  to  January  in  2004.The  District\nRural Development Cell, Burdwan district, reported in March 2005 that 7,604\nsuch groups had been formed in the 277 gram panchayat area of Burdwan\nsince April 1999. More than 2,750 of these groups were exclusively for women.\nAll  these  indicate  that  literacy  has  increased  awareness  of  participation  in\ndemocratic associations, and this attitudinal change has had a positive effect\non the spread of participatory democracy throughout West Bengal.\n\nThe development of SHGs has given impetus to the establishment of a\nself-funded rural social security system, which helps to do away with the massive\nunderemployment in rural West Bengal. It articulates a concept of governance\nbased on citizens\u2019 democratic acceptance of a carefully crafted balance between\nthe freedom of markets and the provision of public goods for the redistribution\nof wealth in the society involving openness and concern for others. This favors\nthe concept of civil society at all levels, over that of state sovereignty, and is\naimed at the long-standing goal of societal harmony among different sectors,\nnamely, different religions and different castes.\n\nSocial Harmony\n\nThe word \u201csocial\u201d in the expression \u201csocial harmony\u201d is an important\nreminder of the need to view people as part of a collective body and not as\nisolated individuals. It is often said that a family flourishes if there are strong\nties among the members. Likewise a state could also achieve social harmony if\nmore of its citizens were to participate with competence in the structure and\n\n10 A group of rural poor people who voluntarily organize for poverty eradication.

Education enables human beings to make rational\ndecisions in every structure of democracy. In India various social cohesions\nalong with primordial loyalties to language, religion, caste, and ethnic groups\nhave traditionally hindered the development of political citizenship as well as\nsocial harmony. Kahane (1982, page 9) observed,\n\nAlthough in modern western societies primordial associations have recently\nbeen utilized by minorities to promote their occupational, political and\neducational  interests,  they  are  nevertheless  often  considered  a  socially\npathological phenomenon. In India, on the other hand the most common\npattern since at least the beginning of the century has been the utilization\nof primordial associations.\n\nConsciousness of participation in a democratic association cuts into the\nprimordial  loyalties  of  the  members  to  their  social  cohesions  and  thereby\nfacilitates the democratic participatory process that ultimately strengthens the\nbonds within the society.\n\nDifferent  philosophers  have  accounted  in  different  ways  for  the\ndevelopment  of  social  harmony  at  different  periods  of  history.  Confucius\nbelieved that harmony in society would flourish when social intercourse was\ndetermined  by  the  virtue  of  humanity  and  benevolence  (ren),  a  concept\ninvolving openness and concern for others. For that, men of high social rank\nhad the additional responsibility of providing the people with an example of\nproper ethical conduct. This process of widening social networks and shared\nnorms through social interactions remains relevant today, although the complex\nmechanisms,  processes,  relationships,  and  institutions  through  which  the\nprocess can be generated are now different. Literacy is an essential tool in\ncreating the social network and shared norms.\n\nConclusion\n\nParticipation  has  complex  demands,  which  certainly  include  income\ndistribution, equality of opportunity in the context of development, and basic\neducation  of  the  people.  Dreze  and  Sen  (2002,  page  144)  write,  \u201cThe\nempowerment value of basic education is so obvious that there is something\npuzzling in the fact that the promotion of education has received so little\nattention from social and political leaders in the post-independence period.\u201d\nIn fact, the comprehensive and holistic perspective of participation is often\nmissing from the concept of social progress in India.

Policies have not generated entrepreneurship\namong the poor and given them a greater share of economic benefits. A serious\ngap  discovered  after  the  failure  of  the  First  Five-Year  Plan  was  in  people\u2019s\nparticipation in the policy process. The Balwant Rai Mehta Report and later\nreports further brought out the need to narrow the gap. With decentralization\nuncoupled from people\u2019s participation, the poor could not participate in a\nmeaningful way in the policy process. The caste and communal agendas of\nthe political parties also further weakened the process. A real effort at a change\ncame with the 73rd and 74th Amendment Acts in 1992, when nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs) and civil society groups rose up to face the challenge\nof globalization in poor regions. The task was formidable: a huge mass of\npeople had to be brought out of their social alienation and apathy to rediscover\ntheir power and wealth in the deepening democracy. A versatile leadership,\nmotivational advocacy campaigns, self-help groups, and the use of information\nand communication technology (ICT) in governance would make this possible.\nBy the start of the new millennium many grassroots societies in India were\nenjoying  a  resurgence  of  entrepreneurship,  but  only  in  those  regions  that\nbrought a healthy coordination and understanding among the people, district\nadministration, NGOs, and technology. These few regions led the way for\nothers exploring policy implementation processes. This paper brings out the\nexperience of three such regions in three states in India: Purba Midinapore in\nWest Bengal in the east, Bundelkhand in Madhya Pradesh in central India,\nand Godhara in Gujarat in the west.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe assessment and targeting of the poor in backward regions precedes\npoverty  reduction  programs.  Targeting  is  done  to  obviate  the  costly\nidentification of the poor under different schemes. Long and Shrivastava (2002)\n\n1 Associate  Professor,  Centre  for  the  Study  of  Law  and  Governance,  Jawaharlal  Nehru  University,\n\nNew Delhi.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n57\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f58\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\ndescribe  targeting  as  an  innovation  in  program  design  in  response  to\ninformation asymmetry and the high costs of surmounting the information\nbarrier. This policy area has seen a large amount of public-private partnerships\nand  entrepreneurial  networking,  which  have  substantially  increased  the\nparticipation of below poverty line (BPL) families in the countryside. This is\na positive development, since the survey to identify BPL families, introduced\nin 1997, was not carried out in 18 of 31 states, and even where it was carried\nout most BPL families did not get identification cards. This inefficient targeting\nwas primarily due to the reliance on the identification of poor and vulnerable\ngroups  based  on  the  division  between  BPL  and  above  poverty  line  (APL)\npopulation groups in the process of providing food security. Conceptual and\noperational problems inherent in this division have manifested themselves in\nfailed poverty reduction programs,2 where there has been enormous rent seeking\nin  the  form  of  service  delivery  delays  and  misappropriation  of  funds. The\nReport of the Comptroller and Accountant General (CAG 2003) on the rural\nself-employment program Swarna Jayanti Grameen Swarojgar Yojana (SGSY),\nfor instance, revealed that out of $.22 billion spent up to 2003 ($.68 billion\nin all was spent on the program) 53.5% was diverted, misused, or misreported.\nThe CAG report also exposed the pathetically weak governance of program\nimplementation, with state governments using the funds to cover their fiscal\ndeficits.\n\nThis paper deals with the asymmetric information between the principal\n(government) and the agent (poor), which impedes the flow of funds to the\ntargeted poor. It explores the need for community networks that could be\nself-motivated  and  self-accountable. The  primary  data  for  this  paper  were\nobtained through site visits, informal communication with local groups and\npanchayats (rural local governance units), and semi-structured interviews. Many\nlocal beneficiaries, service providers, and fund managers responded to questions\nwith great enthusiasm. Questionnaires on financial and service sustainability\nand replicability were also circulated among those who could read and write.\nSecondary  data  were  obtained  from  project  publications  of  district\ngovernments and from the offices of NGOs working with the panchayats and\nthe district offices (collectorates). Data obtained from panchayat records traced\nthe progress of projects undertaken in partnership with civil society.\n\n2\n\nSome major antipoverty programs in India have had weak results. These include Samporna Grameen\nRozgar Yojana (Comprehensive Rural Employment Scheme), Swarna Jayanti Grameen Swarojgar\nYojana (Golden Jubilee Rural Self Employment Scheme), Indira Awas Yojana (Rural Housing Scheme),\nNational Old-Age Pension Scheme, and Drought-Prone Areas Program.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n58\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fEnlarging Entrepreneurial Networks of Local Citizens in Backward Regions of India\n\n59\n\nThe questions that were generally asked of the local groups were the\n\nfollowing:\n\n(cid:127) When and why did they participate in the NGO program?\n(cid:127) What made them change their minds about participating?\n(cid:127) Were the transactions less costly or more economical as a result?\n(cid:127) Were the transactions done faster, and did faster delivery and the use\n\nof technology influence their decision to participate?\n(cid:127) Was political influence exerted in providing the services?\n(cid:127) Did  they  witness  an  attitudinal  transformation  in  the  local\n\nbureaucracy?\n\n(cid:127) Were rents or bribes involved?\n(cid:127) How were program decisions made?\n(cid:127) Who were involved in this process?\n(cid:127) How many other stakeholders were involved?\n(cid:127) What were their roles?\n(cid:127) What were the horizontal and vertical accountability mechanisms in\n\nthe program?\n\n(cid:127) Could they suggest improvements?\n\nThe three governance experiments were selected for their contribution\nto widening the entrepreneurial networks. The following eight indicators were\nused in assessing program contribution:\n\n(cid:127) Transparency\nParticipation\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127) Accountability\n(cid:127) Ease of service delivery\n(cid:127)\nSocial well-being\n(cid:127) Replicability\nPartnership\n(cid:127)\nSustainability\n(cid:127)\n\nAchieving Governance Objectives in Three Backward Regions\n\nHaldia Subdivision in Purba Midinapore\n\nThis region had always been prone to epidemics of cholera, diarrhea,\nand malaria.

In the early 1990s, with the resurgence of civil society activism\naround the state, this region also generated an increased need for mobilization\nto solve local problems. The growth of people\u2019s networks was a symptomatic\noutcome  of  civil  society  activism  on  local  issues,  which  transformed  an\nepidemic-prone region into a fully sanitized, disease-free, and an entrepreneurial\nvillage cluster in record time.\n\nThis  region  is  made  up  of  38  gram  panchayats,  where  BPL  families\nconstitute a clear majority. The Health for All Program was implemented to\ncontrol diarrheal diseases through improvements in water supply and sanitation\nin  1990  and  1996. This  successful  experiment  reduced  child  mortality  by\ncontrolling the spread of waterborne diseases and imparting good sanitation\npractices. Working clusters of ordinary people, NGOs, and panchayat bodies\nwere formed to promote community participation. The NGOs Lokjagaran\nRamakrishna Mission, Abhyudaya, and Tamralipta Guchha Samiti brought\nthe people and the panchayat bodies together, and the district administration\nworked behind the scenes. The initial clusters shown in Table 1 increased over\ntime, as the project progressed.\n\nTable 1: Cluster Organizations in Haldia Subdivision\n\nWorking Clusters or Combinations of Voluntary Groups\n\nBlocks\n\nLokajagaran Ramkrishna Mission (NGO), Lokasiksha Parishad,\nGram Unnayan, Kendra Sibrampur,  Purba Medinipur district\n\nNandigram I and Nandigram II\n\nAbhyudaya (NGO), Haldia,Chaitanyapur (panchayat office),Purba\nMedinipur district\n\nHaldia, Sutahata, and\nMahisadal (5 gram panchayats)\n\nTamralipta Guchha Samiti and Lokajagaran Ramkrishna Mission\n(NGOs), Lokasiksha Parishad, Gram Unnayan, Kendra Dakshin\nDhalhara, Dakshin Narekeldah (panchayat office), Purba\nMedinipur district\n\nMahisadal (6 gram panchayats)\n\nNandigram II was the first block in West Bengal to be declared a fully\nsanitized block (on 29 December 2001).

TARAhaat (\u201cstar-market for communities\u201d), a project of\nthe NGO Developmental Alternatives, delivers products and services to the\nunderserved markets of rural India using ICT in the local language. The project\nwas launched in September 2000. It mainly serves the Bundelkhand region in\nMadhya Pradesh and adjoining border areas of Uttar Pradesh, where the power,\nroad, and transport systems are antiquated and there is no rail service. Local\nmafias (nati rajahs) and tribal chieftains control administration as they did in\nmedieval  times,  as  a  means  of  controlling  cheap  labor  and  the  rich  forest\nproduce, including timber.\n\nTARAhaat started as an extension of Gyandoot (e-governance project\ninitiated by the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Digvijay Singh to provide\ninformation  and  services  to  people).  A  system  that  combines  local  energy,\nskills, and wisdom with the use of modern technology has been developed to\ngenerate  a  market  for  non-timber  forest  produce,  vegetables,  animals,  and\nhandicrafts.  Villagers  have  been  gradually  inspired  to  benefit  from  skills\ndevelopment, income generation, and other government policies through small\nentrepreneurship. Shops, taxi services, and the provision of handicraft training\nto others are typical village ventures. The TARAhaat Web site now claims to\nbe the first digital portal designed specifically for rural India.\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n61\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\f62\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nTARAhaat operates through franchised business-cum-community centers\ncalled TARAkendras. The TARAkendras  are  primarily  job  markets  for  the\nrural poor, which provide the following services:\n\n(cid:127)\n\nInformation.  Timely  and  relevant  information  on  government\nschemes, health, law, and commodity prices in mandis (community\nmarket) is available.\n\n(cid:127) Communication. An e-mail service, TARAdaak (daak means \u201cpostal\n\nservices\u201d), is available in 10 Indian languages besides English.\n\n(cid:127) Education. This service is in great demand. TARAgyan (gyan means\n\u201cknowledge\u201d)  gives  job-oriented  training  in  the  English  language,\npersonality development, and other subjects (in Orcha Kendra and\nelsewhere), or in computers and information technology (in all other\nBundelkhand kendras especially Niwari, Teherka, and Tricher).\n\nThe first franchised TARAkendra  (\u201cstar center\u201d),  was launched at Orcha\nand then at Niwari, small towns in Tikamgarh district. There were 30 such\nkendras in 2005, out of which around 20 were in Punjab, the rich northern\nstate (Bhatinda, Ludhiana, and Sangrur), and the rest in the Bundelkhand\nregion of Madhya Pradesh, the central state of India. This number was expected\nto rise to 100 by the end of 2005, but as Dr. Ashok Khosla, chairman of the\nDevelopmental Alternatives Group, suggests, at least 400 to 500 TARAkendras\nare needed in rural India to make the venture self-financing.\n\nThe Punjab TARAkendras have not been functioning properly since the\ndemand for information and marketing services is quite low and confined to\nqueries related to emigration to Canada and the USA. However, kendras in\nBundelkhand regions have been providing the following services:\n\nIssuing driving licenses\nIssuing sewa (service) cards to BPL\nIssuing scheduled castes and scheduled tribes (SC/ST) certificates\n\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127) Repairing hand pumps\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127) Delivering government benefits to SC/ST, girls and women, and BPL\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n\nIssuing certificates of domicile\nIssuing ration cards\n\nProviding hospital information\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n62\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fEnlarging Entrepreneurial Networks of Local Citizens in Backward Regions of India\n\n63\n\nThe TARAkendra  charge  only  33  cents  for  each  service,  whereas  the\nvillagers used to spend more than $35 earlier for the same service. Middlemen\nhave been eliminated, so villagers now wait only 6\u201315 days to avail themselves\nof a service, versus the previous maximum waiting period of more than 6\nmonths. A new e-health project, launched to link kendra, patient, and specialist\nin a neighboring big city, has immensely benefited local people, who no longer\nneed to travel long distances to receive health care. TARAkendra services are\nprovided in the following proportion:\n\nJob placement (NGO-driven, with government as a partner) (13%)\n\n(cid:127) Gyandoot services (ICT programs of government) (50%)\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127) Training (self-paced) (33%)\n(cid:127) Others (with partners in business and technology) (4%)\n\nFigure 1 shows the role of ICT in TARAhaat service delivery.\nThe whole process is available on the Gyandoot network maintained by\ngovernment in partnership with NGOs, allowing complete transparency and\nmonitoring.\n\nTARAhaat has become an institution that helps the poor, for whom the\nlack of information, employment, and opportunities for entrepreneurship is a\nmajor weakness of governance. Its Web site is more than a Web portal. It is a\ncomplete  package  offering  Web-based  education,  information,  and\ncommunication  services  in  rural  areas  through  franchisee  cyber  caf\u00e9s  (also\ncalled TARAkendras). It includes an e-mail facility in all Indian languages,\nand  a  wide  range  of  offline  and  online  services  on  different  channels  of\nwww.tarahaat.com. Samsung has donated computers to TARAhaat cyber caf\u00e9s\nin Babina and Lalitpur (Uttar Pradesh), and Tikamgarh (Madhya Pradesh).\nMicrosoft  has  also  given  many  computers  under  the  training  program  for\nwomen in the BPL groups.\n\nTo ensure a transparent system, TARAhaat also teaches English to local\npeople and trains them in policy issues and ICT applications for a nominal\nmonthly  charge  of  Rs100.  Microsoft  and  Samsung  have  joined  this\ntransparency campaign, supporting locally produced street plays that expose\ncases of bad governance.\n\nCaste  and  religious  factors  take  a  backseat,  as  was  evident  in  the\nTARAkendras visited, where women from different communities worked and\nate together. Local products are used to produce locally required building and\nother materials. Energy systems use technology that the local people understand\nmore readily and can manage more responsibly.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n63\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f64\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nFigure 1.

The most important contribution\nof these kendras is the time saved by BPL tribal people in Bundelkhand. Now\nthey do not have to make long trips to the district collector\u2019s office to get their\ndriving licenses and SC/ST certificates, the two services in greatest demand.\nThe  lack  of  agricultural  or  any  other  means  of  livelihood  had  made  these\npeople  dependent  on  government  aid.  Information  about  the  kinds  of\noccupations available in the market has recharged these communities.\n\nSocial  well-being  has  increased  as  a  result  of  the  diversification  of\nTARAhaat services to other areas and the use of the community knowledge,\nwisdom,  and  skills  of  all  the  residents.  Small  enterprises,  self-help  groups,\nrural  cooperatives,  voluntary  organizations,  schools,  retailers,  exporting\ncorporations\u2014TARA Nirman Kendra (\u201cstar construction centre,\u201d which uses\nenvironment-and people friendly technologies and designs), Desi Power Group\nof Companies, and TARAhaat Information and Marketing Services Ltd. among\nthem\u2014have been organized under the program. There is scope for the use of\nevery bit of rural skill and sensitivity.\n\nMahiti Shakti of Godhra in Panchmahal District of Gujarat\n\nThis  governance  experiment  rose  out  of  a  partnership  between\ngovernment and local agents and the technical supply wing of the National\nInformatics Centre (NIC). The Mahiti Shakti (\u201cpower of information\u201d) project\nhas transformed the lives of tribal people especially those living in Gogumbha,\nthe poorest of the tribal villages, located at least 60 miles (97 kilometers) from\nGodhra city. Before the project, these people had to walk long distances to\nGodhra city to obtain medical aid, a ration card, an SC/ST certificate, or a\ndriving license.\n\nEight NGOs surveyed the information needs of 13 villages in the district.\nThe survey revealed that the villagers mainly needed land records (maps, records\nof  rights),  government  forms,  agriculture,  and  information  related  to  the\nadministrative system at the village level, called the panchayati raj, which may\nprovide information and support to the poor for legal assistance, health care,\nand seasonal programs of government.\n\nThe  project,  a  brainchild  of  the  district  magistrate  of  Panchmahal,\nMs.  Jayanthi  Ravi,  brought  this  information  closer  to  the  people  through\nkiosks installed in places visited most frequently by villagers, like groceries\nand eateries. In October 2000, the Concept Centre for Electronic Governance\nof the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad developed a \u201cproof of\nconcept\u201d for citizen-to-government and government-to-citizen transactions\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n65\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f66\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nusing information technology as a medium. The National Bank for Agriculture\nand  Rural  Development  (NABARD),  which  is  India\u2019s  apex  bank  for  rural\ndevelopment, also carried out a feasibility study, which has inspired many\nother banks to finance the kiosks.\n\nMahiti Shakti uses infrastructure already available in the villages. Working\ncomputers and a large number of frequented public telephone booths were\nnetworked and connected to the Internet. Trained operators from NIC helped\nvillagers get access to information at these Mahiti Shakti kendras. Printouts\ncould also be obtained, for a maximum of Rs10 per form. The kiosks thus\nprovided single-window clearance for forms and other information that people\nin the villages used to have to spend much time, energy, and money to get.\n\nAs many as 200 district services forms have been made available online.\nInformation  about  ongoing  schemes  like  those  of  the  District  Rural\nDevelopment Agency and the District Planning Board has also been made\navailable. The Web-enabled version of the Gujarat Geographic Information\nSystem gives details of the availability of resources such as land, cattle, and\nmilch  animals. Weather  forecasts  are  available  from  a  control  room  at  the\nDistrict Disaster Management Department, which functions 24 hours a day.\nThe villagers have become so dependent on these information kiosks\nthat  services  cannot  be  disconnected  even  for  an  hour.  Thus,  the  local\ngovernment officials have to work at full capacity, with transparency, individual\naccountability,  and  increased  openness.  Accountability  and  reliability  are\nensured through an on line grievance redressal mechanism called SWAGAT.\nAt a videoconference held once a month, the state chief minister and villagers\nmeet  with  the  district  administrators,  including  the  district  magistrate,  to\nresolve the villagers\u2019 problems.\n\nThe  successful  formula  has  been  replicated  in  other  programs:  the\nInternet-Dhaba  (\u201ckiosks\u201d)  scheme,  e-Dhara  (\u201cinformation  flow\u201d)  center,\ne-Gram (\u201cvillages\u201d), and e-medical help. Between 2001, when e medical help\nwas  launched,  and  July  2005,  more  than  20,845  used  the  service  for  free\ntuberculosis  treatment,  medicine  supply,  and  doctor\u2019s  appointments  for\npathological tests. On the average, 300 villagers use this service daily. Similarly,\naccording to the district office records of Godhra, from April to August 2005\nmore than 382 applications requesting information and citizens services were\nreceived at the block level, and more than 11,477 photocopies were requested.\nOn the basis of a minimal fee worked out for these services, earning for the\nlowest office of district government increased from a deficit position to an\nearning of $5,738 in a financial year. Besides the economic returns, villagers\nhave come to see the need to democratize the deliberative bodies in villages\nand blocks, and have also formed entrepreneurial groups. Some of the less-used\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n66\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fEnlarging Entrepreneurial Networks of Local Citizens in Backward Regions of India\n\n67\n\nlaws and regulatory provisions before e-governance, such as the expansion  of\nrural markets under the Agriculture Produce Committee Act of 1961 of the\nGujarat  government,  have  also  received  a  push.  For  instance,  with  the\ninformation available at the kiosks, villagers have opened 25 dairy centers in\nrural  areas  populated  mainly  by  poor  shepherd  tribes. These  community-\ngoverned  markets  or  village  cooperatives  form  the  agriculture  produce\nmarketing committee composed of farmers\u2019 and traders\u2019 representatives, an\nagricultural extension officer, a representative of the municipal corporation,\nand  the  registrar  of  cooperative  societies. This  committee  now  has  a  Web\nportal,  www.agmark.net. The  Gujarat  State  Agricultural  Marketing  Board\nmanages and coordinates the functioning of this committee.\n\nBesides forming meaningful income-generating clusters, the program\nhas transformed the poor villagers by showing them a government that works\nor can be made to work. It has also transformed the local bureaucracy, which\nhas gained through reliable service delivery.\n\nConclusion\n\nreduction programs.\n\nSome important lessons can be drawn from this study of the three poverty\n\nFirst,  the  targeted  approach  to  poverty  reduction  generally  leads  to\ninefficient  policy  implementation  and  misappropriation  of  funds.\nAdministrative identification is rooted in colonial bureaucratic models that\nare unscientific and unreliable.\n\nSecond,  non-targeted  schemes  that  provide  information  to  people\nmotivate them to know more about government programs. Income generation\nopportunities become more accessible to ordinary citizens and poor families\nrealize better the value of their assets.\n\nThird, partnership with intellectual groups and professional training from\nuniversities and management institutions infuses reliability into these programs,\nand makes funds\u2014loans from banks and project grants from national and\ninternational funding agencies\u2014more readily available. The sustainability of\nthe innovative experiment in governance is thus ensured till it becomes self-\nsufficient.\n\nFourth, ICT applications in these service delivery programs have changed\nattitudes to technology. Now technology is more commonly looked upon as a\nfacilitator rather than a tool for power accumulation, as was the case during\nthe green revolution. ICT has been able to cut through the caste and communal\nmind-set as benefit seekers appear before a neutral service provider, a kiosk.\nLast, entrepreneurial networks grow when local bodies deliver transparent,\n\nfast, and reliable service.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n67\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f68\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nReferences\n\nComptroller  and  Auditor  General.  2003.

Former development policies and programs were uniformly\nimplemented throughout the country under a ministerial decree that disallowed\nany possibility for differentiated models. As a consequence of decentralization,\nrecent  local  government  policies  and  practices  have  had  social,  cultural,\neconomic, and political influences from across the diverse archipelago. Even\nthough the decentralization laws in Indonesia are still looking for their final\nform, in terms of development planning, the decentralization process has been\nopening up chances for local government to develop new planning mechanisms,\nas  shown  in  various  localities  like  Bima  and  Dompu  regencies  under  the\nSupport for Decentralization Measures (SfDM project) of German technical\ncooperation (GTZ); 35 municipalities and regencies in various provinces under\nUSAID\u2019s Performance Oriented Regional Management (PERFORM) Project;\nand budget planning in Bandung regency (Usui and Alisjahbana 2003, Sumarto\n2003, GTZ Advisory Team 1997).\n\nWithin the framework of the new decentralization policies, participatory\nplanning allows local government to be more responsive to the public and to\ndeliver better service. More importantly, the characteristic of participatory\nplanning  of  trying  to  involve  all  development  stakeholders  can  minimize\npotential conflicts among those involved in development. This paper focuses\non how the practice of participatory planning underlines the need for public\nadministration to change its role and function in development and how it\ncontributes to building a more harmonious society. This paper examines the\npractice of participatory planning in decentralized Indonesia, with empirical\nfindings  from  Solo  municipality,  which  adopted  participatory  planning  in\n2001. This has been accorded recognition through a \u201cparticipatory award\u201d\nfrom LogoLink, an international network for participatory planning initiatives.\n\n1\n\nLecturer, Public Administration Department, Padjadjaran University, Bandung, Indonesia.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n69\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f70\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nIn Solo, rethinking the development paradigm was crucial because the city\u2019s\ndiversity has contributed to a high level of conflict and social disintegration.\n\nThe Changing Nature of Public Administration: The Emergence\nof the Participatory Approach to Local Governance\n\nEven  though  public  administration  is  still  a  debated  concept,  it  is\nconsidered the most important field of political science, both as a practice\nand as a field of study (Starling 2005, page 1). It is also viewed as a dynamic\nconcept, since it is influenced by the social, political, economic, and cultural\nenvironments. Berkley and Rouse (2004, page xi) argue that the dynamics of\npublic administration is closely related to the increasing value of disparities\nwithin the community. In the same vein, Peters (2003, page 2) notes that the\ndynamics of public administration leads to differences in public administration\npractices across countries. In view of these factors, there is a need to use an\nintegrated  and  multidisciplinary  approach  to  understanding  public\nadministration.\n\nThe emergence of the New Public Management (NPM) in the 1980s\nand  1990s  marked  the  evolution  of  the  nature  of  public  administration.\nRegardless of the different ways that public administration theorists refer to\nthe NPM model\u2014ranging from \u201cmanagerialism\u201d (Pollitt 1993) to \u201cmarket-\nbased public administration\u201d (Lan and Rosenbloom), in fact the New Public\nManagement is basically focused on management and on performance appraisal\nand efficiency. Therefore, NPM is moving toward private sector characteristics\n(Starling 2005, Peters 2003, Hughes 1998). Compared with the traditional\nunderstanding of public administration, this latest development is influenced\nby the democratization process within global economical and political systems\n(Starling 2005, Peters 2003). The new understanding of public administration\nnow  makes  the  concept  of  \u201cgovernance\u201d  an  important  element  in  public\nadministration.\n\nEven though the definition of governance has great variation, the most\nfundamental notion of governance for our purposes is that government is no\nlonger the autonomous and authoritative actor that it might have been at one\ntime. Rather, the public sector is now conceptualized as depending on the\nprivate sector in a number of different ways, and much of public policy is\ndeveloped and implemented through the interaction of public and private\nactors. Since governance is understood as the process of decision making and\nthe process by which decisions are implemented, an analysis of governance\nfocuses on the formal and informal actors involved in decision making. OECD\n(2001)  notes  that  good  governance  has  eight  major  characteristics\u2014it  is\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n70\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fLocal Governance, Decentralization, and Participatory Planning in Indonesia\n\n71\n\nparticipatory,  consensus-oriented,  accountable,  transparent,  responsive,\neffective and efficient, and equitable and inclusive, and it follows the rule of\nlaw, as shown in the figure below.\n\nThe call to establish good governance has given the public the chance to\nbe  involved  in  decision  making. The  old  style  of  government-dominated\ndevelopment programs is no longer trusted. Instead, there is an urge to ensure\nthe  direct  participation  of  the  community  in  conceptualizing,  planning,\nimplementing, monitoring, and evaluating development programs. Many argue\nthat governance will find its best performance within decentralized systems\n(Samaratungge 1998, Rondinelli and Cheema 1983). Decentralization focuses\non two main aspects: decentralization between levels of government and also\nfrom government to other institutions such as the market and nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs) (Bennet, in Samaratungge 1998, page 7). It is the transfer\nto lower-level government of legal, administrative, and political authority to\ndecide and manage public functions (Samaratungge 1998, page 8). Conyers\n(1990) argues that decentralized governance is produced by good governance.\nHer  research  found  that  more  than  62  developing  countries  have  been\nimplementing the decentralization process, which basically offers \u201copen space\u201d\nfor  the  community  to  be  involved  in  decision  making  and  development\nplanning.\n\nSaito (2000, page 1) argues that decentralization can contribute to good\ngovernance because it can change the relationship between central government\nand  local  government,  besides  strengthening  the  relationship  between\n\nCharacteristics of Good Governance\n\nConsensus-\noriented\n\nAccountable\n\nParticipatory\n\nFollows the\nrule of law\n\nGOOD\nGOVERNANCE\n\nTransparent\n\nResponsive\n\nEquitable and\ninclusive\n\nEffective and\nefficient\n\nSource: OECD (2001), page 117.\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n71\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\f72\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\ngovernment  and  civil  society.  Since  the  1980s,  decentralization  has  been\npromoted as a solution to many problems of administration and governance.\nIn the global context, according to the International Development Research\nCentre (IDRC), decentralization has almost become a prescription for a more\ndemocratic society. Most governments like the idea of unblocking centralistic\ngovernment, improving management capacity, and giving more direct access\nto policy making. In developing countries in particular, decentralization has\ngained popularity because of problems arising from the impact of centralistic\ngovernment  (IDRC  2002,  pages  1\u20132).  As  quoted  by  Gilbert  in  Helmsing\n(2001,  page  2)  estimates  that  63  out  of  75  developing  countries  are\nimplementing  decentralization  policies  to  share  their  central  government\nfunctions with local governments. More specifically, Conyers (1990, page 16)\nargues that the benefits of decentralization lie in its capacity to increase people\u2019s\nparticipation in planning development activities.\n\nHowever, LogoLink (2002, page 17) has noted that in many cases the\ndecentralization to local governments of powers, authorities, and responsibilities\nfor delivering basic services has not been accompanied by the decentralization\nof resources needed to carry out these mandates. The case of decentralization\npolicy in some South African countries showed that the incapability of local\ngovernments to manage local resources led to the failure of decentralization\n(Rondinelli 1981). One important aspect of decentralization policy is how it\nrelates to decentralized fiscal resources. How can local governments implement\nplanning and policy if they have no access to financial resources? For example,\nthe  decentralization  program  in  Zimbabwe  failed  because  the  central\nGovernment still held all the financial resources under its authority (Conyers\n1990,  page 21).  In  contrast,  the  Philippine  decentralization  program  is\nconsidered successful because it has a legal framework to ensure that the central\nGovernment will decentralize financial resources to the local level (LogoLink\n2002; IIRR, LGSP, SANREM CRSP/Southeast Asia 2000). Even though the\nrelationships between decentralization and participation are obvious, the degree\nof success of participatory planning depends on power relationships. What\npower is actually decentralized? And to whom is power decentralized? Who\nhas power at the local level? (Conyers 1990, pages 21\u201324).\n\nParticipatory  Planning  Approach:  An  Alternative  Strategy  for\nBuilding a Harmonious Society\n\nThe new planning paradigm was declared by the United Nations Centre\nfor  Human  Settlements  (UNCHS)  1994  in  Nairobi.  According  to  the\ndeclaration,  new  development  planning  should  consider  community\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n72\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fLocal Governance, Decentralization, and Participatory Planning in Indonesia\n\n73\n\nparticipation, the involvement of all interest groups, horizontal and vertical\ncoordination, sustainability, financial feasibility, and interaction of physical\nand  economic  planning. The  declaration  concluded  that  the  community\nbecomes the main agent of development because it is the community that is\ndirectly  affected  by  development  planning. The  new  terminology  of  anti-\ncentralistic planning\u2014including bottom-up planning, participatory planning,\ndemocratic planning, grassroots planning, public involvement, collaborative\nplanning, and advocacy planning\u2014shows that new development planning\nparadigms should open up more space for the public to participate in decision\nmaking that affects their own lives and future.\n\nFriedman (1992, page 3) defines planning as a process that connects\nscientific  and  technical  knowledge  with  activities  in  the  public  domain  to\nenhance social transformation. Furthermore, he argues that planning can be\nseen as social learning and social transformation. As social learning, planning\npositions the government as facilitator. The characteristic of this planning is\npeople learning by doing. It is decentralized, bottom-up, and politically open.\nAs  social  transformation,  planning  is  a  political  process  with  a  collective\nideology  (Friedman  1992,  page  4).  Participation  is  defined  as  public\ninvolvement  in  development.  The  degree  of  people  involvement  in\ndevelopment could be varied. Arnstein (1969, pages 216\u2013217) states that, in\npractice,  participation  can  develop  into  three  main  different  typologies:\nnonparticipation, tokenism, and  citizen participation. In planning theory,\nparticipation is understood as giving the public space to discuss problems and\npriorities. The degree of community participation in planning will depend on\nthe dynamics of knowledge, actors, and space within the planning process. In\nunderstanding participatory planning, these three elements become important.\nParticipatory planning usually involves different stakeholders with different\nknowledge and interests. The knowledge used in the process also varies with\nthe  stakeholders  involved.  Space  refers  to  all  opportunities  that  influence\nplanning, including formal and informal organizations and policy making\n(LogoLink 2002, pages 8\u20139).\n\nPublic participation in planning brings closer relations between the local\nauthority  and  the  community.  Decentralized  planning,  it  is  believed,  can\novercome all the limitations created by centralized planning (Rondinelli and\nCheema 1983, page 14; Samaratungge 1998, page 2). It can cut short a long\nprocedural  process  and,  as  a  consequence,  should  increase  local  officials\u2019\nknowledge of administrative capabilities (Rondinelli and Cheema 1983, page\n15). The benefits of participatory planning identified by Rondinelli (1981,\npages 135\u2013136) are:\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n73\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f74\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nLess bureaucracy\n\n(cid:127) Accommodation of local needs\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127) More effective and realistic planning\n(cid:127) Greater political and administrative emphasis on remote areas\n(cid:127) Greater representation in policy making\n(cid:127) Greater  administrative  capability  of  local  government  to  manage\n\ndevelopment\n\nFlexible, innovative, and creative administration\n\n(cid:127) More efficient political dynamics, control of decision making\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127) More effective location of services and facilities by local leaders\n(cid:127) Greater national unity, more public goods and services\n\nParticipatory  planning  also  involves  communities  in  identifying  and\nplanning  their  needs,  as  well  as  in  implementing  and  evaluating  them\n(LogoLink 2002, page 34). Moreover, the advocates of participatory planning\nbelieve  that  this  approach  can  open  up  opportunities  for  people  excluded\nfrom  development  not  only  to  participate  in  decision  making  but  also  to\nassess the level of local government transparency and accountability (LogoLink\n2002, page 4). The decentralization of management and development planning\nis important because it can spread growth and integrate different regions and\ndiverse countries. For example, the Tanzanian administrative reform in 1972\nabolished traditional government, and gave more authority to local government\nin development planning (Rondinelli 1981, page 134).\n\nIn terms of promoting a harmonious society, local governments can play\nan  important  role  in  facilitating  and  promoting  peace  through  good\ngovernance. The principles of good governance, which ensure the equitable\nand accessible provision of government services, the protection of security\nand human rights, and the active promotion of community harmony and a\n\u201cculture of peace,\u201d can be achieved through appropriate approaches and tools.\nTherefore, the participatory planning approach can be used as an alternative\nstrategy toward a harmonious society.\n\nParticipatory Planning in Decentralized Indonesia:\nSeeking a New Path to a Harmonious Society\n\nAs  previously  mentioned,  Indonesia  is  now  moving  toward  more\nparticipatory planning. However, in practice there are many differences between\nlocalities  depending  on  their  social,  cultural,  and  political  background.  A\nsuccessful example is the municipality of Solo, which adopted participatory\nplanning in 2001 and has been accorded recognition through a \u201cparticipatory\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n74\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fLocal Governance, Decentralization, and Participatory Planning in Indonesia\n\n75\n\naward\u201d from LogoLink, an international network for participatory planning\ninitiatives (Sugiartoto 2003, page 202). Solo, also known as Sala or Surakarta,\nhas an important place in Indonesia\u2019s history as the capital city of the former\nMataram kingdom. It is known as a center of Javanese culture, and is home to\ntwo historic palaces\u2014the Surakartan Palace (Keraton Kasunanan) and the\nMangkunegaran Palace. Both palaces are now chiefly symbolic, and have no\nadministrative or decision-making power. In modern Indonesia, the city has\nemerged  as  a  forerunner  in  the  reform  movement  (Sugiartoto  2003;\nQomaruddin 2002a, 2002b).\n\nSolo is located in Central Java province, only 60 kilometers from the\ncity of Yogyakarta, which is well known for its leading role in social and political\nchange. The population of Solo is about 550,000. However, during the working\nday that can triple to 1.5 million, as people come from the surrounding areas\nfor employment, trade, commerce, and governance activities (Sugiartoto 2003,\nPratikno 2002). Solo is a municipality with five subdistricts and 51 smaller\ndivisions known as kelurahan. Under the new decentralization program, the\nmunicipality carries the same functions as other Indonesian local government\nareas, including responsibility for education, health, social services, and public\nadministration.\n\nPreviously, development planning in Indonesia was highly centralized\nand followed complex stages of planning, characterized by elite and bureaucratic\ndomination from sub-village (kelurahan) to national levels. After a long struggle,\nIndonesia gained independence from the Dutch colonial power in 1945. Five-\nyear development plans were introduced in 1969, and from that time to the\nthird plan, which ended in 1984, Indonesian development prioritized economic\ngrowth rather than social issues. During this time, Indonesian development\nwas designed by and for political leaders, economists, and administrators for\ntheir own benefit (Rondinelli and Cheema 1983, Marthuur1983, Samaratungge\n1998). The main stakeholders of development planning processes at the national\nlevel were the National Development Planning Board, known as BAPPENAS\n(Badan  Perencanaan  Pembangunan  Nasional),  all  ministries,  regional\ngovernments,  and  other  related  institutions.  Universities  were  involved  as\nconsultants.  At  province  and  regency  levels,  development  planning  was\nconducted by government agencies known as Regional Development Planning\nBoards, or BAPPEDA (Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Daerah).\n\nAt the village level, planning was conducted under the strong influence\nof the village head and a government organization known as the Community\nResilience  Group  (Lembaga  Ketahanan  Masyarakat  Desa  [LKMD]).\nTheoretically, the LKMD represented community needs, although in reality\nit only strengthened the power of the village head, who appointed the LKMD\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n75\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f76\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nhead and the secretary. Members were mainly elite community figures (tokoh\nmasyarakat) (Antlov 2002a, Van Den Ham and Hady 1989). As a consequence,\npoor communities were rarely involved in decision making, and development\nfocused on physical infrastructure (Sugiartoto 2003, Pratikno 2002).\n\nThis has been categorized as \u201cdevelopment by, for, and from the kelurahan\nofficials\u201d (Sugiartoto 2003, page 140). In fact, case studies show that kelurahan\nofficials also had no strong bargaining position in planning. Although local\nplanning  may  have  been  conducted  by  kelurahan  officials,  the  programs\nundertaken were determined at higher government levels, without appropriate\nrepresentatives from the kelurahan (Rahmanto 2003, Pratikno 2002).\n\nIndonesia\u2019s  development  planning  since  the  early  1980s  has  been\ndescribed  by  officials  as  participatory,  yet  the  notion  of  participation  was\nrhetorical rather than real. Participation at that time was limited to the middle\nclass, including academics, local bureaucrats, or well-known businesspeople\n(Hady 1997, page 151; Sjaifudian 2002, page 3). Development planning in\nIndonesia evolved from mainly top-down during the 1960s to a combination\nof bottom-up and top-down planning in 1982, when a ministerial decree for\nbottom-up  planning  was  enacted. This  established  Guidelines  for  Local\nDevelopment Planning and Monitoring, known as the P5D system (Pedoman\nPenyusunan Perencanaan dan Pengendalian Pembangunan di Daerah). Under\nthis law, development planning was intended to be conducted from the lowest\nlevel of government administrative bodies (villages and kelurahan) to district\nor municipality levels. However, because the P5D system positioned upper-\nlevel governments as decision makers for the lower levels, local government\nhad no ability to decide which programs could be funded or implemented.\nAfter  lengthy  and  cumbersome  decision  processes,  higher-level  planners\napproved only 5\u201310% of proposals initiated at the village level (Buentjen,\nquoted in Sjaifudian 2002, page 4).\n\nCriticism of the old planning mechanism strengthened during the reform\nera that began in 1998, following the downfall of the Suharto government.\nAn early change under decentralization in Solo occurred in the name of the\nformer Community Resilience Board (LKMD), which became known as the\nVillage  Community  Development  Institution  (Lembaga  Pemberdayaan\nMasyarakat Kelurahan [LPMK]). The institution\u2019s function also changed. It\nis no longer the only institution with final decision in planning; rather, planning\nnow involves several village institutions, although problems still emerge because\nof  misunderstandings  about  the  new  role,  and  the  inconsistency  of  local\nregulations. For example, the mayoral decision ratifying the LPMK in 2003\nstated  that  participatory  development  planning  was  the  responsibility  of\nLPMK.  In  contrast,  an  earlier  mayoral  decision  on  participatory  planning\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n76\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fLocal Governance, Decentralization, and Participatory Planning in Indonesia\n\n77\n\nmechanisms stated that the process would be conducted by an independent\ncommittee. Another inconsistency is in the design of block grants. Again, the\nmayoral decision stated that LPMK had a role in this design, while a different\nmayoral  instruction  said  that  the  block  grant  should  be  designed  by  a\nnominated committee. Moreover, the organizational structure of LPMK is\nnot clear. For example, it includes the Women\u2019s Welfare Organization, when\nthat group existed independently under the existing kelurahan administrative\nsystem.2\n\nIn Solo, rethinking the development paradigm was crucial because the\ncity\u2019s diversity (as shown in the table) has contributed to a high level of conflict\nand social disintegration.\n\nStructure of Solo Community, 2003\n\nSubdistrict\n\nCharacteristics\nof Population\n\nReligion\n\nMuslim\nChristian\nBuddhist\nHindu\n\nPasar\nKliwon\n85,374\n\n54,130\n30,289\n869\n87\n\nReligious\n\nJebres\n136,866\n\n103,901\n30,624\n1,397\n944\n\nEthnicity\nAcademic\n\nLaweyan\n107,200\n\nBanjarsari\n162,363\n\nSerengan\n61,758\n\n85,215\n21,133\n433\n419\n\n114,368\n45,590\n1,556\n869\n\n47,048\n14,500\n145\n62\n\nEntrepreneurial\nUrban\n\nSlum area\nAgricultural\n\nDeveloping\nIndustrial\n\nSocioeconomic\nCharacteristics\n\nSource: Kartono (2004), page 54.\n\nBetween 1911 and 1998, Solo experienced at least 11 major riots relating\nto economic disparities and political and social issues. These began with conflicts\nbetween Javanese and Chinese traders in 1911, radical anti\u2013Surakartan Palace\nmovements in 1918\u20131920, and anti-Chinese movements in 1960 and 1980.\nThe most serious violence surrounding the downfall of the Suharto regime in\n1998 occurred in Solo. Apart from the social and personal loss and destruction,\nthe region lost around Rp500 billion ($58,823,529, at $1=Rp 8,500), 10,000\npeople lost their jobs, and around 50,000 to 70,000 people became unemployed\n(Kartono  2004,  Qomaruddin  2002a,  Pratikno  2002,  Sugiartoto  2003).\nKartono (2004, pages 11\u201312) notes that the high conflict potential of Solo\nwas triggered by power and value struggles within the diverse community,\nand argues for a new alternative planning process that considers community\n\n2\n\nPersonal communication, IPM Solo staff, Division of Community Empowerment and Advocacy,\n2004.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n77\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f78\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nparticipation to help overcome the socioeconomic disparities, and also for\nconflict management.\n\nIn particular, Solo has introduced a new paradigm in development called\nhumanized development (pembangunan nguwongke uwong), which positions\nequality and freedom of expression as important rights of citizens. In general,\nthis covers the issues of partnership and community participation, improved\nhuman resources management, economic development, and law enforcement.\nThe new participatory planning was jointly initiated by universities, NGOs,\nand the new Solo Planning Agency (Bapeda) (IPGI Solo 2002b, BAPPENAS\nand GTZ 2003, Kustiawan 2003, Sugiartoto 2003).\n\nThe Solo city government made a radical change in 2001 by introducing\ndirect  community  involvement  through  a  mechanism  called  Participatory\nDevelopment Planning (Perencanaan Pembangunan Partisipatif [PPP]) (IPGI\nSolo 2004b, LogoLink 2002, Pratikno 2002). The change in Solo began after\na government official at the municipality level named Qomaruddin took part\nin  a  Ford  Foundation\u2013supported  study  tour  on  decentralization  and\nparticipatory governance to the Philippines in 2000. He was able to advise\nthe mayor and other staff about participatory practices. However, as has often\noccurred in Indonesia\u2019s transition to democracy, he met with resistance from\nthose afraid of losing power and control (LogoLink 2002, Pratikno 2002). At\nthe same time, he continued working with interested NGOs and academics\nand established a partnership forum called Indonesian Partnership for Good\nGovernance Initiatives (IPGI) Solo (Sugiartoto 2003, page 30). IPGI Solo\nconducted discussions at the local level to determine an appropriate planning\nconcept. These discussions involved the Solo Planning Agency (Bapeda), the\nState  University  of  Surakarta,  and  Gita  Pertiwi,  a  local  NGO  involved  in\nenvironmental and governance issues (Sugiartoto 2003).\n\nThe  discussions  began  with  research  on  the  role  of  the  Community\nResilience Board (LKMD) in development. This was conducted in 10 selected\nkelurahan out of the 51 in Solo. The selection of the research sites was based\non certain criteria that reflected Solo\u2019s diversity: kelurahan with a mainly Muslim\npopulation, those occupied by mostly poor communities, kelurahan populated\nmostly by non-Javanese, kelurahan with complex informal sector problems,\nkelurahan mostly occupied by wealthy communities, and those far from the\ncity center, which rely on agricultural activities. This research found that the\ndomination of LKMD in development planning at the kelurahan level created\nhigh  community  resistance  to  the  role  of  LKMD  (IPGI  Solo  2004b,\nSugiartoto 2003).\n\nThe new wave of decentralization has not significantly changed local\ndevelopment  planning,  which  remains  weak  and  confusing.  The  initial\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n78\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fLocal Governance, Decentralization, and Participatory Planning in Indonesia\n\n79\n\nenactment of Solo\u2019s new participatory planning method in 2001 was not very\neffective, possibly because at that time the idea of establishing new planning\nmechanisms was still new. The wording of the relevant mayoral document\nsuggested that only kelurahan-level governments should follow participatory\nplanning.3 The Solo government was caught between accommodating a new\nidea and keeping the old system that was still used throughout the country.\nThe legal framework of participatory planning was also unclear at the\nprovincial and national levels. This lack of clarity contributed to the uncertainty\nof planning processes at the kelurahan level, and to the resistance of kelurahan\ngovernment officials to the new methods. However, IPGI Solo persisted in its\nefforts  to  introduce  change  through  participatory  pilot  projects  in  the  10\nvillages covered by the research (Sugiartoto 2003, Pratikno 2002). Regardless\nof the difficulties, the initiative of IPGO Solo, in partnership with Solo\u2019s local\ngovernment, is considered good practice because even within the uncertain\nplanning laws and procedures, local government followed a new paradigm of\ndevelopment.\n\nThe experience of other countries including Nicaragua, the Philippines,\nand Viet Nam also shows the importance of legal frameworks (LogoLink 2002).\nHowever,  the  existence  of  a  legal  framework  itself  does  not  guarantee  the\nsuccess of participatory planning. Other enabling factors, such as a strong\ncommunity, involvement of NGOs, and other social and political elements,\nare  major  contributors  to  the  success.  For  example,  the  Philippines  could\nimplement participatory local planning because an appropriate sociopolitical\nenvironment existed along with the legal framework. However, in Viet Nam,\neven  though  the  relevant  legal  framework  has  been  in  place  since  1945,\nparticipatory  planning  has  never  been  practiced  because  of  the  absence  of\nother enabling factors (LogoLink 2002, pages 32\u201335).\n\nUnder Solo\u2019s mayoral circular letter in 2001, the new planning mechanism\nbegan with development meetings at the kelurahan, sub-municipality, and\nmunicipality levels. Decisions then moved to the Regional Planning Board\n(Bapeda), and on to budget planning through the regional government, before\nprojects were undertaken at the community level. A forum was elected from\nthe community, government, university, and private sectors to conduct the\nkelurahan development meeting. The LKMD and the kelurahan head (lurah),\nwho used to be the main decision makers in kelurahan planning, were now\nonly facilitators, and the kelurahan development meeting was funded from\nthe Solo municipality annual budget (APBD) (Sugiartoto 2003, page 100).\n\n3 Circular letter from Solo\u2019s mayor (Surat Edaran, SE Walikota, No. 411.2/789).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n79\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f80\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nThe change to a new paradigm has been a slow process because the old\nplanning mechanism was in use for more than 20 years. The barriers to new\nplanning methods and ideas include cultural obstacles and the attitudes and\norientation of both the bureaucracy and the people (Sugiartoto 2003, LogoLink\n2002).  For  example,  the  Javanese  community  is  very  patrimonial  and\nhierarchical,  and  its  culture  contrasts  with  the  principle  of  participatory\nplanning (Logolink 2002, page 25). As Sugiartoto (2003, page 27) points\nout, this attitude developed in Solo\u2019s royal court (kraton) and disallows the\npossibility of viewing ordinary citizens as equals. Because of the predominance\nof the \u201cold order\u201d (represented by the traditional community leaders) in the\nmeetings  at  kelurahan,  subdistrict,  district,  and  city  levels,  this  culture\ncontinues. In this culture, the relationships between leader and community,\nand between government and community, still follow the patron-client system.\nMost of the bureaucracy in Solo shows resistance to change, especially among\nthose who benefit from the old system. Many bureaucrats are still skeptical\nand  doubtful  of  participatory  planning  (Bapeda  Kota  Surakarta  2004,\nLogoLink 2002). Hence, change is still largely superficial, and the top-down\napproach still dominates.\n\nIn the first year of its implementation, the new planning mechanism\nshowed only a slight difference from the previous method under the P5D\nsystem. From IPGI Solo\u2019s experience, the new planning implementation did\noften increase the number of people involved in the process. For example, in\nkelurahan Batuanyar, P5D meetings were usually attended by 30 to 40 people,\nwhereas in 2001 from 35 to 105 people were involved in the new mechanism.\nHowever, increased community involvement in the process did not guarantee\na significant change in the planning process, because the community did not\nunderstand the participatory planning method. Perhaps because of adherence\nto  or  the  influence  of  the  old  development  planning,  the  first  kelurahan\ndevelopment meeting was also conducted without clear direction. There was\nno  list  of  program  proposals  made. The  local  elite  still  dominated;  hence,\ndevelopment  was  still  the  same  and  was  mainly  focused  on  physical\ninfrastructure  such  as  the kelurahan  office  and  renovation  of  the  symbolic\nvillage gateway (gapura)4 (IPGI Solo 2004b, IPGI Solo 2002a).\n\nThroughout the Suharto period, the community came to understand\ndevelopment as merely physical. Moreover, people had neither the means nor\n\n4 During the Suharto New Order regime, the gapura symbolized levels of development achieved in\nIndonesian  villages  or  kelurahan.  A  gapura  could  be  erected  only  after  a  certain  percentage  of\nhouseholds in the settlement were classified as having left the poverty level. Often, disproportionately\nlarge sums of money were expended on their construction and maintenance.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n80\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fLocal Governance, Decentralization, and Participatory Planning in Indonesia\n\n81\n\nthe confidence to criticize, and tended to accept government decisions. This\nled to inappropriate programs. Qomaruddin  (2002, page 14) noted that this\nlegacy  engendered  difficulties  in  gaining  community  participation  in  Solo\nplanning  processes.  Another  problem  was  that  the  community  had  no\nexperience in conducting democratic meetings; therefore, their capacity and\nskills remained very limited. At the next level, that of the sub-municipality,\nthe situation was the same. Although up to 397 people could be involved on\nthe  first  day  of  a  sub-municipality  development  meeting  in  kelurahan\nBanjarsari, for example, the outputs were still the same as those under the\nP5D system. In 2001, 70% of programs concentrated on physical development,\nand  only  30%  on  social,  economic,  and  cultural  issues  (Sugiartoto  2003,\npage  171). At the district level, the number of people involved was far greater\nthan expected.  At  least  800  people  from  different  areas  were  involved  in\nplanning. However, the output again could not satisfy stakeholders involved\nin this case, because of inappropriate time management. Most of the time\nwas consumed by discussion of a code of conduct rather than the content of\ndevelopment issues (Sugiartoto 2003, pages 174\u2013177).\n\nIn 2002, the second year of the new mechanism, planning at kelurahan\nlevel showed a difference in prioritizing development activities. A new mayoral\ndecision provided stronger law enforcement, and increasing attention was paid\nto nonphysical activities, including a credit scheme for pedicab drivers and\nfood sellers, land reclamation programs, and street vendor issues (Pratikno\n2002, IPGI Solo 2002a, Sugiartoto 2003, IPGI Solo 2004b). After the learning\nexperience  of  the  first  year,  the  2002  kelurahan development  meeting  was\nconducted with a clearer direction and more support from higher levels of\nlocal government. For example, the Regional Planning Board collaborated\nwith IPGI Solo in training 255 facilitators for 51 villages (IPGI Solo 2004b,\npages 12\u201313). The process started from neighborhood meetings, which listed\nprogram priorities to be discussed at subdistrict meetings. Not all kelurahan\nwere able to submit a list of priorities because of their limited capability to\nproduce an appropriate plan document; in such cases the subdistrict committee\nprioritized programs on the basis of data provided at the kelurahan meeting.\nDuring  this  period,  community  interest  and  involvement  in  kelurahan\ndevelopment  meetings  increased,  and  although  some  kelurahan  heads  had\ndifficulty gaining community participation, others attracted strong interest,\nwith the highest involvement being 400 persons (IPGI Solo 2004b, page 3).\nWomen\u2019s participation in the kelurahan development meetings increased\nonly from 5% in 2001 to 7% in 2002. However, real progress was made, in\nthat people began to address structural issues, which were impossible to discuss\nopenly under the New Order regime. From the second year of implementation\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n81\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f82\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nof participatory planning, Sugiartoto (2003, pages 196\u2013197) noted at least\nthree lessons learned: people were more open to change, they were also starting\nto criticize government policy, and they were becoming more aware of their\nown problems. A number of significant problems still have to be overcome.\nThere is still a highly structured hierarchical power relationship in the local\nculture. In negotiations between people and the state, this is overtly expressed\nthrough the formal uniforms worn by local government staff. Another difficulty\nis  that  the  introductory  participatory  planning  generated  \u201cwish  lists\u201d  that\nfrustrated the community and officials because the program proposals made\nwere rarely approved (LogoLink 2002, pages 46\u201347).\n\nA number of practical problems also occurred. In one case, socioeconomic\nrepresentation was unequal, and in another ward officials were excluded from\nthe  meeting  for  the  sake  of  efficiency.  Some  kelurahan  facilitators  were\nineffective, and presented a long list of problems or needs without any clear\nindication of how problems occurred and how they could be resolved (Rahmanto\n2003, page 67). The uncertain role of the still existing Community Resilience\nGroup  (LKMD)  also  created  difficulties  (IPGI  Solo  2004b,  page  4).  Some\ninconsistencies  remained  because  of  lack  of  coordination  and  agreement\nbetween  local  government  offices,  and  the  production  of  different\ndocumentation. For example, relevant new local planning documents such as\nthe local annual plan (Repetada) and the local strategic plan (Renstrada) were\nnot  available  because  the  main  guideline,  the  local  development  program\n(Propeda)  was  still  only  in  draft  form.  Planning  documents  also  followed\ndifferent time frames. One of these was for the period 2002\u20132005, another\nfor 2002\u20132006, and yet another for 2003\u20132007 (Bappenas and GTZ 2003,\npage 70). The latest Solo participatory planning mechanism under the 2004\nmayoral decision addresses these issues by integrating the planning documents.\nDespite  the  practical  problems,  in  2003  and  2004  community\ninvolvement  continued  to  increase.  Development  prioritized  long-term\nprograms such as the poverty alleviation program in kelurahan Pasar Kliwon,\nwhich allocated a block grant for the pedicab driver credit scheme (economic\naspect). Other kelurahan allocated scholarships for the poor (free education\nfor the poor) (IPGI Solo 2004a and 2004b). Budget transparency began to\nincrease, and the allocation of funds to development programs was clarified.\nIn 2004, significant changes were made in gender issues, representation,\nprogram  priorities  and  indicators,  the  role  of  planning  committees,\nopportunities for participation, time frame, design of mayoral decisions, and\ntransparency (IPGI Solo 2004a and 2004b). Every planning stage must now\ninvolve at least 30 women, and the List of Development Programs must also\nconsider women\u2019s perspectives. The 2004 initiatives also involve the informal\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n82\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fLocal Governance, Decentralization, and Participatory Planning in Indonesia\n\n83\n\nsector more directly in planning. Another change is that the Priority List is no\nlonger held at the district level, but is decentralized to the subdistrict level.\nMayoral decisions are also designed for more public involvement, and must\nbe discussed publicly before they are enacted.\n\nThe  new  participatory  planning  method  has  generated  significant\ndifferences in the stakeholders involved, the mechanisms used, the levels of\ncommunity participation, and financial sources. The old system involved only\nthe head of the kelurahan, subdistrict staff, the LKMD, and informal leaders.\nThe new planning system involves NGOs, civil society organizations, informal\nsectors, kelurahan officials, political parties, university staff, and the Kelurahan\nCommunity Development Institution (LPMD), previously called the LKMD\n(IPGI Solo 2004b). The new planning begins with neighborhood discussions,\nand aims to maximize community participation. Financing now comes from\nSolo\u2019s local development budget, called the kelurahan block grant. The role of\ngovernment now is mainly that of facilitator rather than decision maker.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis paper argues that the implementation of a participatory planning\napproach in Solo has reduced the high conflict potential in the city because it\npositions equality and freedom of expression as important rights of citizens.\nIn  general,  participatory  planning  covers  the  issues  of  partnership  and\ncommunity participation, improved human resources management, economic\ndevelopment, and law enforcement. From analyses of the case of Solo, it is\nevident that the limitations of the participatory planning practice relate to the\nloss of community trust in the role and function of government at all levels.\nFor example, it is a tendency of local government to merely change the name\nof  institutions  or  processes  without  introducing  real  change.  One\ndemonstration of this is resistance to the former Community Resilience Board\n(LKMD) as village planner because of its image as an institution of the New\nOrder regime. Although the LKMD was renamed the Village Community\nDevelopment Institution (LPMK), the basic functions of the institution and\nthe degree of representativeness remain the same.\n\nThe dilemma of the LKMD position in development planning indicates\nthe existence of an \u201canti New Order.\u201d The same indications can be found in\nmany localities, and in my opinion this situation has engendered demands for\na  \u201cfree  New  Order\u201d\u2014the  desire  for  changes  in  institutions  and  systems\nregardless of their positive or negative aspects. The importance of understanding\nthe philosophy of the new system is sometimes neglected. This is underlined\nwhen local government in many localities introduces a \u201cnew planning system\u201d\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n83\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f84\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nthat is in fact the same New Order planning system, in the hope of erasing the\nnegative image of the New Order regime.\n\nThis  paper  also  found  stronger  recognition  of  the  importance  of\nparticipatory planning in the decentralization era. Particularly in Solo, the\nlocal government has been working together with NGOs and civil society\norganizations  to  establish  a  new  planning  mechanism  that  generates  more\nparticipatory  development. The  experience  of  Solo  shows  that  the  direct\ninvolvement of the community in all stages of participatory planning creates\na feeling of inclusion and a sense of purpose. The community is enthusiastic\nfor  the  process  (Qomaruddin  2002b,  page  15).  Moreover,  new  relations\nbetween  different  ethnic  groups  begin  to  develop.  People  are  involved  in\nparticipatory planning as a community. The community also becomes more\nresponsible for development programs in its area, and is motivated to learn\nskills related to participatory planning (Qomaruddin 2002b, page 16).\n\nFrom the Solo case study, it can be seen that the success of participatory\nplanning as an alternative strategy for building a harmonious society can be\nachieved  only  by  maximizing  the  roles  of  all  development  stakeholders.\nAwareness  of  the  importance  of  networking  between  all  development\nstakeholders should be developed further to keep balanced relationships among\ndevelopment stakeholders. However, change has not been maximized and is\nslow because there is limited understanding of the process. In Solo, the strong\nlocal culture has influenced the practice of participatory planning through\nkelurahan, sub-municipality, and municipality meetings. There is a tendency\ntoward elite domination and the exclusion of women and the young generation.\nAnother  obstacle  is  the  difficulty  in  convincing  some  top-level  local\nadministrators and local parliament members to support the new planning\nmethod. There is also a need to institutionalize access to information in decision\nmaking through an appropriate legal framework.\n\nIt  can  be  concluded  that  even  though  the  practice  of  participatory\nplanning in Solo has opened a new track toward a more harmonious society,\nshifting  to  a  new  development  paradigm  is  not  an  easy  job.  Participatory\nplanning requires those who hold power to share it with other development\nstakeholders, thus reducing their control over the community. The Solo case\nstudy shows that it is important to emphasize the need of local government to\nchange the way it behaves and to develop new relationships with the community\nand other development stakeholders.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n84\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fLocal Governance, Decentralization, and Participatory Planning in Indonesia\n\n85\n\nReferences\n\nAntlov, H., 2002a.

In 1992, the Management Development Program decentralized power\nand created management capacity at the local level. In 1994, the Public Service\nLaw sought to define the tasks and directions of the public service system. In\n1996, a reform policy on the trends and structure of government activities\nclarified the structure, authority, and functions of the central Government.\n\nBut, despite these reforms, decentralization in Mongolia has been centrally\ndriven and implemented slowly, and is so far incomplete. Citizens elect local\nparliaments, but governors are nominated by these parliaments and appointed\nby the next higher level of government. Administratively, local governments\nhave some control over local personnel, but sectoral policy decisions (primarily\nin health and education) remain centralized. Budgeting is still centralized as\nwell, and local governments neither have significant revenue-generation powers\nnor control over intergovernmental transfers.\n\nMongolia lacks an integrated decentralization strategy and still has only\na vague understanding of the decentralization concept, its virtues and threats.\nAs a result, some recent reforms have reversed the decentralization process. A\nreform  of  the  General  Tax  Law  (GTL)  in  2001  reduced  local  budgets\nsignificantly, and the Consolidated Budget Law (CBL) mandated the inclusion\nof  the  personal  income  tax  in  the  central  budget  after  2002.  Similarly,  in\n2003,  the  Public  Sector  Finance  Management  Law  (PSFML)  required  all\nspending on education and health to be part of the line ministers\u2019 portfolio,\nrather than financed out of local government\u2019s budgets, as was done previously.\nThese centralizing measures aside, the decentralization agenda is still active in\nMongolia and continues to move ahead with the support of civil society and\ninternational development organizations. The movement has been particularly\nactive in the engagement of citizens in public decision making.\n\nThis paper discusses fiscal decentralization and citizens\u2019 participation in\nlocal budgeting in Mongolia, the lessons learned, and suggested improvements.\nFiscal decentralization is influenced by the interests of the central Government,\n\n1 Director, Management College, The Academy of Management, Ulaanbaatar Mongolia.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n90\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fCitizens\u2019 Participation in Local Budgeting: The Case of Mongolia\n\n91\n\ncitizens\u2019 participation, and the capacity of the local governments to implement\nthis policy. Citizens\u2019 participation is the hallmark of fiscal decentralization.\n\nCountry Profile\n\nMongolia is a unitary state with a central government and three levels of\nsubnational governments: aimags and the capital city, which have provincial\nstatus;  soums  (rural  districts)  and  duuregs  (urban  districts);  and bags  (rural\nsubdistricts) and horoos (urban subdistricts). Aimags and the capital city are\nintermediate tiers of government, and soums/duuregs and bags/horoos are local\ngovernments. Bags and horoos are the lowest formal administrative and territorial\nunits. There are now 21 aimags with 329 soums, and 1,560 bags. The capital\ncity has nine duuregs with 117 horoos. For a country of the size and population\nof Mongolia, having 2,000 or so subnational units means jurisdictions with\nvery  low  population  densities. To  address  this  issue,  the  Government  of\nMongolia  is  discussing  a  regionalization  plan  to  reduce  the  number  of\nsubnational units in the country.\n\nAccording to the Constitution, the administrative and territorial units\nof  Mongolia  are  organized  on  the  basis  of  both  self-governance  and  state\nmanagement. Hence, Mongolia has a dual system in which each administrative\nand  territorial  unit  has  both  a  governor  and  a  hural  (assembly  of  people\u2019s\ndeputies). While the former represents the central Government throughout\nthe territory, the latter is a truly representative institution.\n\nAimag and soum hurals serve as representative bodies of the local people,\npass regulations for their respective political and administrative jurisdictions,\nand monitor the local administrative bodies. In addition, hurals approve the\nbudgets of their respective aimags and soums and oversee budget execution.\nAimag and soum governors run the local administrative organizations and are\nthe  local  representatives  of  the  central  Government.  Governors  make,\nimplement, monitor, and evaluate local policies. The governors\u2019 offices also\nprovide administrative services: they serve as civil registries, provide notary\nservices,  and  expedite  licenses  and  permits.  Bag  and  horoo  hurals  are  self-\ngoverning organizations with the direct involvement of residents; their main\nfunction is to solve common local issues. Bags and horoos also have governors,\nwho primarily provide liaison between the citizens and soum authorities.\n\nHurals are elected directly by local residents. Aimags and soums vary greatly\nin size and population, and the size of each hural varies with its population\n(see table). In the selection of governors, hurals submit their nominees to the\ngovernor at the next level of government, who makes the appointment. Thus,\naimag  governors  are  nominated  by  the aimag  hural  and  appointed  by  the\nprime minister. Soum governors are nominated by the soum hural and appointed\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n91\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f92\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nby aimag governors, and bag governors are nominated by the bag hural and\nappointed by soum governors.\n\nSize of Hurals, by Number of Representatives\n\nLevel of Government\n\nPopulation\n\nNumber of Representatives\n\nAimag\n\nUlaanbaatar\nSoum\n\nDuureg\n\nUp to 50,000\n50,001\u201390,000\nMore than 90,000\n\nUp to 2,000\n2,001\u20139,000\nMore than 9,000\n\n25\n30\n35\n40\n15\n20\n25\n15 (3 duuregs)\n35 (5 duuregs)\n\nUnder  this  dual  system,  state  management  of  government  seems  to\ndominate  self-governance,  as  the  appointed  governors  at  each  level  have\nultimate control over the functioning of the administrative and territorial\nunits. Currently, there is a substantial amount of delegation of state powers\nto aimag governors,2 and of intermediate powers to local governors. Thus, in\ngeneral the center of power lies in the governors, who implement most of\nthe major sectoral functions and decisions as representatives of the central\nGovernment.\n\nBudgeting\n\nThe budget cycle in Mongolia consists of four stages: budget formulation,\nbudget  appropriation,  budget  execution,  and  budget  monitoring  and\nevaluation. Each budget entity goes through these four stages. The PSMFL\n(article 4.1.4) defines a budget entity as \u201can organization that carries out the\nfunctions and services of the state either with national or local funds.\u201d Thus,\nfor example, at the soum level there are six budget entities: the soum hural, the\nsoum governor\u2019s office, and the soum\u2019s school, kindergarten, cultural center,\nand hospital.\n\nThe process of budget formulation begins with each soum and aimag\nbudget entity preparing its budget proposal.

The proposals are submitted by\neach entity\u2019s general manager and accountants. The deadline for submitting\nthe budget proposals of the soums\u2019 budget entities is not defined, but is usually\nbetween June and July of each year.\n\nThe  DFET  in  the  aimag  governor\u2019s  office  consolidates  the  budget\nproposals  of  the  soum  hurals  and  soum  governors\u2019  offices  and  sends  the\nconsolidated proposals to the DFET head and to the budget officers of the\nMinistry of Finance and Economy (MOFE) before 15 August. Similarly, the\naimag  education,  culture,  and  health  departments  consolidate  the  budget\nproposals of the soum budget entities and submit the consolidated proposals\nto their respective line ministries at the state level, which review the proposals\nand submit them to MOFE, also before 15 August. The MOFE reviews and\nconsolidates  the  budget  proposals  of  all  the  entities  and  submits  the\nconsolidated proposals to the Government of Mongolia before 15 September.\nThe Cabinet then discusses the state budget and submits it to the Parliament\nof Mongolia before 1 October. This marks the end of the budget formulation\nprocess (adopted from PSMFL).\n\nThe budget formulation process has its origin in the strategic business\nplans (SBPs), on which the budget entities base their budget estimates. SBPs\nare 3-year plans made according to the general budget framework approved\nby the Parliament of Mongolia. An SBP must reflect the strategic tasks of a\nbudget entity for the next 3 years, as well as the type, quantity, quality, and\ncost of the expected budgetary outputs (PSFML, article 26.2). In addition to\nthe SBPs, soums and aimags must base their budget priorities on their midterm\n(3\u20135 years) and long-term (more than 5 years) development plans, and on the\ngovernor\u2019s 4-year action programs.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n93\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f94\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nBudget Proposal Submission Process\n\nSoum Governor\u2019s\nOffice\n\n(cid:102)\n\nSoum\nGovernor\n\nSoum Hural\n\n(cid:102)\n\nChairman of\nSoum Hural\n\nSoum School,\nKindergarten,\nCultural Center,\nHospital\n\nAimag\nGovernor\u2019s\nOffice\n\nAimag Hural\n\n(cid:102)\n\nMOFE\n\n(cid:102)\n\n(cid:102)\n\nAimag Governor\n\n(cid:102)\n\n(cid:102)\nDFET in Aimag\nGovernor\u2019s Office\n\n(cid:102)\n\n(cid:102)\n(cid:102)\n\n(cid:102)\n\n(cid:102)\n\nChairman of Aimag\nHural\n\nAimag Education and\nCulture Department\nAimag Health\nDepartment\n\n(cid:102)\n\nMOECS\n\n(cid:102)\n\nMOH\n\nDFET = Department of Finance, Economics and Treasury; MOECS = Ministry of Education, Culture and Science;\nMOFE = Ministry of Finance and Economy; MOH = Ministry of Health\n\nSource: Adapted from PSFML and CBL\n\nThe  absence  of  a  specific  deadline  for  submitting  these  proposals  is\nproblematic, because it introduces uncertainty to the budgetary process and\ngives aimags very little time to consolidate the budget and engage in meaningful\ndiscussions about budget priorities.\n\nThe process of budget appropriation begins with the Parliament\u2019s approval\nof the state budget. In early December, aimag hurals approve aimag budget\nproposals within the approved budget framework. After this, the soum hurals\nalso approve soum budget proposals and submit these to the aimags sometime\nin December. While the soums\u2019 budget proposals are undergoing approval at\nthe  aimag  hural,  the  soum  governors\u2019  offices  have  the  opportunity,  though\nlimited, to exert influence.3 However, once the aimag hural approves the budgets,\nthe soum hural can no longer make changes in the line items. In January, the\nsoum hural releases a budget resolution and submits it to the DFET in the\naimag governor\u2019s office, together with the detailed budget allocation.\n\nThe process of budget appropriation, stakeholders say, is not properly\nregulated. Not only do the norms (Administrative and Territorial Units, Their\nManagement Law, CBL, and PSMFL) fail to fully and coherently regulate the\nprocess,  but  the  soum  and  aimag  hurals  have  not  yet  designed  efficient\n\n3 This is done through the elected representatives of the soums to the aimag hural.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n94\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fCitizens\u2019 Participation in Local Budgeting: The Case of Mongolia\n\n95\n\nprocedures to coordinate the process.4 As things stand today, only once during\ntheir sessions do the local hurals hold an open discussion to comment on the\nbudget proposals submitted by the governors. As a consequence, the local\nhurals pay very little attention to the process of budget approval. Also, because\nbudget proposals focus on the financing of current expenditures, which are\nrelatively  small,  these  meetings  do  not  stimulate  productive  and  effective\ndiscussions.  Moreover,  the  budget  proposals  of  soum  hospitals,  schools,\nkindergartens,  and  cultural  centers  are  not  discussed  in  the  hurals  as  the\nproposals are directly approved by the Great Hural of the State within the\nframework  of  the  respective  sector  budgets.  As  a  result,  soum  citizen\nrepresentatives indicate that in practice the budgets do not reflect the real\npriorities  of  the  soums.  For  this  reason,  budget  approval  often  becomes  a\nformality, with limited participation from soums and aimags.\n\nThe budget year goes from 1 January to 31 December. During this period,\nsoum and aimag budget entities collect revenues according to their revenue\nplans,  and  spend  in  accordance  with  two  instruments:  output  purchase\nagreements (OPAs) and performance agreements (PAs). After the Parliament\nof Mongolia approves the state budget, line ministers at the state level sign\nOPAs  with  aimag  governors  and  PAs  with  general  managers,  who  are\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of the budget entities. Similarly,\nafter the aimag hural approves the aimag budget, the aimag governors sign\nOPAs with the soum governors and PAs with the general managers. At the\nsoum level, once the hurals approve the budgets, the soum governors sign PAs\nwith the general managers.\n\nThrough OPAs and PAs the different levels of government coordinate\ntheir spending, mostly on health and education. This budget execution process\nhas helped local budget entities (schools, kindergartens, etc.) to execute their\nbudgets more effectively, to limit overspending, and, consequently, to improve\noverall fiscal discipline.\n\nDespite the improvements introduced by the performance agreement\nsystem, however, the current system of budget execution still has deficiencies,\nwhich include the lack of flexibility of budget entities to meet local needs and\na mismatch between national priorities and local revenue generation.\n\nBudget  entities  cannot  meet  local  needs.  When  higher-level  budget\nentities approve budget proposals, they largely ignore local opinions, as well\nas the geographical, economic, and social factors of each particular case. Instead,\nbudget approval is based solely on the previous year\u2019s budget, so during budget\n\n4 Only the CRHs of Tuv and Orkhon aimags, and some districts of Ulaanbaatar, have specific regulations\n\non budget approval.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n95\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f96\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nexecution soums have little flexibility to respond to local needs. For example,\nin Umnudelger soum of Khentii aimag, the budget for meals for schoolchildren\nin 2004 was the same as in 2003, so it fell short of meeting the necessities for\n2004 (Center of Mongol Management 2004).\n\nThere  is  a  mismatch  between  national  priorities  and  local  revenues\ngeneration.  In  the  current  system,  budgets  do  not  fully  provide  for  the\nappropriate  revenue  sources  for  the  financing  of  a  number  of  government\nprojects  that  local  governments  must  implement.  Local  budgets  are\noverburdened,  and  the  implementation  of  the  projects  is  often  hampered.\nThe situation has been particularly problematic in the local implementation\nof national programs related to structural changes, like the White Revolution,\nwhich is not funded out of local budgets.\n\nThe fourth stage of budgeting\u2014after budget formulation, appropriation,\nand execution\u2014is budget monitoring and evaluation. Mongolia has several\nmechanisms for budget monitoring and evaluation. These include both internal\nand external controls. The internal mechanisms are: (i) hierarchical control\nby  the  governors,  and  (ii)  financial  inspection  by  the  State  Professional\nInspections  Agency. The  external  mechanisms  are:  (i)  monitoring  by  local\nhurals, (ii) auditing by the State Audit Board, and (iii) monitoring by citizens.\nGovernors are responsible for controlling budget execution by the budget\nentities. They have authority to evaluate budget performance and, if necessary,\nto penalize misconduct. According to the Administrative and Territorial Units,\nTheir  Management  Law  (article  33.2),  soum  governors  have  the  power  to\npenalize  directors  of  soum  budget  entities  (governor\u2019s  office,  schools,\nkindergartens, etc.). Penalties for budgetary misconduct range from reductions\nin the salary of the directors of budget entities for a period of 1 to 3 months,\nto the termination of employment. In practice, however, soum governors do\nnot seem to use these powers regularly, even when they discover irregularities\nin budget execution.5\n\nThe State Professional Inspection Agency (SPIA) is a central government\nregulatory agency, with branches in each aimag. The SPIA has the right to\ninspect all administrative services, including budget execution. Its Department\nof Financial Inspections reviews the budget every 2 years. If it uncovers financial\nmisconduct, the department may impose financial penalties. According to\nsoum administrators, however, the sanctioning power of the department is\nineffective and not sufficiently preventive.\n\n5\n\nFor instance, in Tarialan soum, Uvs aimag, the hospital director was penalized by the soum governor\nwith a 20% reduction in salary for 3 months, because of a procurement problem. Unfortunately,\ncases that a soum governor exercised this power are few.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n96\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fCitizens\u2019 Participation in Local Budgeting: The Case of Mongolia\n\n97\n\nThe State Audit Board acts on behalf of the Parliament of Mongolia to\naudit the execution of the budget and the implementation of laws. The State\nAudit Board has branches in each aimag, the aimag audit boards. These boards\nperform financial audits of aimag and soum hurals, governors\u2019 offices, and\nother budget entities. In addition to the State Audit Board, the CBL, PSMFL,\nand the Administrative and Territorial Units, Their Management Law give\nhurals extensive monitoring rights. However, for a number of reasons, these\nrights are seldom fully exercised. For example, central line ministries\u2014and\nnot hurals\u2014approve the expenditures of state budget entities. Thus, since\nhurals  have  no  authority  over  these  expenditures,  they  cannot  effectively\nmonitor them.6\n\nCitizens\u2019 Participation in Budgeting\n\nCitizens in the local areas virtually do not participate in monitoring and\nother stages of the budgetary process. Generally, this is so because the budgetary\nprocess  in  Mongolia  has  traditionally  been  vertically  driven. The  new\nconstitution  promotes  participation,  but  the  development  of  local  self-\ngovernance is in its initial phases. Therefore, citizens in bags, soums, and budget\nentities have very limited participation.\n\nSome participation takes place at the local level, mostly in the form of\nwritten  and  orally  transmitted  communications  between  citizens  and  line\ndepartment civil servants, soum administrators, and elected officials. In Tarialan\nsoum,  for  example,  citizens  are  invited  to  the  budget  approval  meetings.  In\nUndurshil soum, an opinion poll conducted by the hural of Dundgobi aimag\nresulted in the creation of two bag centers at a cost of MNT800,000 (approx.\n$658).7  Also,  citizens  in  this  soum  requested,  and  received  from  the  aimag\ngovernor,  MNT500,000  (approx.  $411)  for  reconstructing  the  bag  office\nbuilding. These funds came from an emergency fund under the discretionary\ncontrol of the governor. Citizens also express their opinions concerning school\nand  hospital  heating,  schoolchildren\u2019s  meals,  prices  of  products  bought  by\nbudget entities, and local investment needs (Center of Mongol Management\n2004).\n\nAccording to this research, there are there are three main reasons for the\nlow  levels  of  citizen  participation. The  citizens  themselves  lack  knowledge\nabout  the  activities  of  local  governments  and  the  ways  in  which  they  can\nparticipate. Also, the limited size of budgets and their high fixed-expenditure\ncommitments discourage participation, as citizens believe that participating\n\n6 Only the hural of Baruunturuun soum, Uvs aimag, uses its monitoring rights.\n7\n\nBank of Mongolia. http://www.mongolbank.mn (accessed on 15 September 2005).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n97\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f98\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nwould not be effective. On the other hand, local governments, administrators,\nand politicians also rarely encourage citizen participation. According to one\nquestionnaire used the research made by CMM,8 79.7% of the citizens who\nwere  interviewed  had  not  participated  at  all  in  local  budget  making  and\nspending. This is too low a level of participation.\n\nCitizens usually do not know that they can participate in budgeting\nand how can participate in it. More than half of those asked did not know\nabout existing mechanisms for holding decision makers accountable. Citizens,\nhowever, have the right to request the SPIA and the State Audit Board to\nconduct financial inspections and audits, but they do not exercise this right.\nCitizens think that participation would not be effective. Among the\ninterviewees, 29.4% thought that they could take an active part in the local\nbudgetary process but have not participated; 64.5% said that citizens could\nnot expect to have their common issues reflected in the local budget; 34.2%\nsaid that they had participated in budgeting, but their suggestions were not\nreflected in the budget.\n\nCitizens  are  interested  in  participating,  but  local  politicians  and\nadministrators usually ignore their interest. The questionnaire also revealed\nthat more than half of the interviewees were interested in participating in the\nmonitoring of budget execution. But 40% agreed that there was not enough\ninformation on budget execution, and 90% wanted to have such information\nmade more available to the public.\n\nMore generally, citizens\u2019 participation is low in the bags, soums, and budget\nentities.  Bags  are  the  primary  organizational  units  in  the  country. These\ntraditional  forms  of  association  have  traditionally  provided  a  suitable\ngeographical division for Mongolians living in distant locations. Bags are the\nfirst entry point for citizens, so they are the basic units of decentralization and\ncitizens\u2019 participation. Citizens\u2019 participation in bags, however, is very limited.\nAt present, the legal framework is not consistent in addressing the issue of bag\nparticipation. On the one hand, the Constitution (article 59) dictates that\nbags should have meetings of citizens; on the other hand, the Administrative\nand Territorial Units, Their Management Law does not provide bags with an\nindependent budget. The salary of the bag governor, for example, is part of\nthe soum budget. Budgetary independence is a critical factor in participation.\nIn the case of the Sustainable Livelihoods Program, for example, the selection\nof projects is discussed openly in the Bag Common Hural, and this has become\nthe engine for promoting citizens\u2019 participation in local decision making. In\n\n8 The Research on Fiscal Decentralization made by the Center of Mongol Management (CMM) and\n\nfinanced by Household Livelihoods Support Program in 2004.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n98\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fCitizens\u2019 Participation in Local Budgeting: The Case of Mongolia\n\n99\n\nother words, citizens will decide to participate only if they see a benefit in\ndoing  so.  Soums,  being  the  lowest  level  of  government  with  budgetary\nautonomy, are supposed to organize open discussions to decide local budgetary\nallocations. In practice, however, this process is ineffective for at least two\nreasons. First, soums approve the budget proposals of hurals, governors, and\ngovernors\u2019 offices, but not those of schools and hospitals. Leaving out decisions\nabout health and education, which are an important component of citizens\u2019\ndemands, makes hurals less participatory. Second, even if there is a tendency\nfor  more  active  participation  in  budget  planning,  at  the  time  of  budget\napproval, authorities are not bound to incorporate citizens\u2019 proposals, and\nthis further discourages citizen participation.\n\nProblems and Suggestions\n\nThe research identified a number of problems associated with the current\nsystem  of  local  public  finances  in  Mongolia  and  the  level  of  citizens\u2019\nparticipation  in  local  budgeting.  These  problems,  together  with  some\nsuggestions, follow.\n\nLack of information and transparency. There is an overall feeling among\nstakeholders that transparency in the operation of budget entities is still limited.\nSpecific budget information is not available or is inadequately provided to\ncitizens.  Similarly,  other  information  on  the  activities  and  performance  of\ngovernment  activities  is  not  available  to  the  public.  None  of  the  local\nadministrations in the aimags and soums covered by this research provided\nopen information on its budget execution to citizens. The situation calls for\nbroadening citizens\u2019 access to government information. The whole budgetary\nprocess must be made more transparent. Budget entities especially must make\ntheir expenditures and performance measures more accessible to citizens.\n\nLow capacity (lack of knowledge and skills). Although limited, a number\nof  reforms  have  been  introduced  to  rationalize  the  budgeting  by  local\ngovernments. The reforms, however, require heavy investments in training\nand capacity building, which are still missing. Specifically, local officials require\ntraining in the preparation of strategic business plans, outcome definition,\ncost estimation, performance evaluation, and the drafting of effective contracts\nand performance agreements. In addition, a number of soums and aimags,\nespecially in the most remote parts of the country, still need basic training in\ngenerating medium- and long-term development plans, and in formulating,\nexecuting, and monitoring their budgets. For this reason, the effects of the\nreforms have not yet materialized. For example, even though local budgets\nshould be performance-oriented, budgets are still planned according to the\nold input-based classifications and provisions. The central Government must\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n99\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f100\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\ntherefore invest heavily in local capacity building. Training to improve the\ntechnical skills of public servants in charge of local fiscal functions, including\nskills in the preparation of strategic business plans, is needed.\n\nLack of accountability. Overall, local accountability in Mongolia is still\nweak. Most accountability mechanisms are vertical, so horizontal and social\naccountability is undermined. Line ministries, especially in the health and\neducation sectors, have strong vertical control over their local representatives.\nThis weakens the accountability of these central representatives to both the\nlocal hural and the citizens. Not only do elected local bodies have ineffective\nmechanisms to hold local administrations accountable, but citizens also lack\nways  to  effectively  control  their  local  governments.  Citizens  do  not  have\neffective mechanisms to voice their demands and complain about the inefficient\nwork  of  public  servants. There  must  be  additional  mechanisms  for  social\naccountability to allow citizens to voice their concerns and local governments\nto respond to those concerns.\n\nLack of local participation. Citizens\u2019 participation in both the executive\nand legislative branches in bags, soums, and aimags is marginal. Citizens have\nlimited  knowledge  and  information  about  the  public  policies  of  local\ngovernments. One questionnaire used in this research found that only 9.5%\nof those interviewed had participated actively in local budget making and\nspending.\n\nThe existing legislation fails to provide options for citizens to participate\nin  the  planning  and  monitoring  of  budget  entities,  and  citizens  also  lack\nknowledge and information about administrative and budget reforms. The\ntraditional thinking that it is up to the administrators to solve local problems\nis still dominant among local residents. Mongolia has had no experience in\nthe  decentralization  of  its  public  administrative  institutions. Therefore,\ndecentralization and local self-government skills are not yet developed. Even\namong civil servants there is no agreement on the concepts, requirements,\nand mechanisms of decentralization. In various cases, local problems continue\nto be solved in a centralized way, with very little participation from citizens.\nNew mechanisms for citizen participation must be devised to allow efficient\nstate-society interaction, especially in the areas of local planning and budgeting.\nInterference from higher tiers of government. In many ways, Mongolia\nremains a centralized country with a strong central presence\u2014administrative\nand political\u2014at the local level. Central line ministries still exercise power at\nthe  local  level,  and  this  limits  local  self-governance.  Fiscally,  most  locally\ngenerated revenue ends up in the central budget, creating a disincentive to\nincreased local tax collection. Local governments are still far from having the\npolitical, administrative, and fiscal autonomy to govern their own affairs, with\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n100\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fCitizens\u2019 Participation in Local Budgeting: The Case of Mongolia\n\n101\n\nlittle  intervention  from  the  central  Government.  In  sum,  the  limited\npossibilities for increasing local revenues and the few initiatives in support of\nlocal  interests  have  become  obstacles  to  the  development  of  local  self-\ngovernance and decentralization. The central Government must clarify the\ncurrent assignment of expenditures and ensure that the country\u2019s development\nplans incorporate both national and local priorities.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe low levels of citizens\u2019 participation are caused by citizens\u2019 insufficient\nknowledge of how they can participate in budgeting, the limited size of local\nbudgets  and  their  high-fixed  expenditure  commitments,  and  the  lack  of\ninitiative among local governments, administrators, and politicians. Mongolia\nneeds to communicate more information about local budgeting, encourage\ncitizens\u2019 participation in budget making, and improve the accountability of\ndecision makers. What is missing is citizens\u2019 participation that serves as a basis\nfor fiscal decentralization.\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n101\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\f102\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nReferences\n\nCenter  of  Mongol  Management.  2004.

Handapangoda2\n\nIntroduction\n\nPublic participation in democratic society is both vital and problematic.\nCitizen engagement in the development and implementation of policy can\nhelp to generate a heightened sense of public value for what government does.\nListening to citizen preferences, providing citizens with an opportunity to\nanalyze available options and determine a preferred option, and providing\nfeedback through performance measurement and monitoring and evaluation\nare all likely to help ensure that the public will value more highly the publicly\nfunded  services  they  receive.  According  to  Berner  (200,  page  23),  citizen\nparticipation in governance is widely encouraged by academics and professional\norganizations and is a popular conference topic. What do governments try to\naccomplish when they involve citizens? There are two expectations (Berner 2001):\n\n(cid:127) To inform the public of government decisions, and\n(cid:127) To involve the public in decision making.\n\nThis paper discusses the level of citizen participation in local government\n\nauthorities in Sri Lanka and its relationship to the size of local authorities.\n\nThe local government of Sri Lanka has a long history extending to the\nperiod of Sinhalese kings in the 4th century. The oldest chronicle of Sri Lanka,\nMahawansa (6th century), mentions local administration by the nagara guttika\n(city mayor). Village organizations called gam sabhas3 functioned under village\nleaders, who enjoyed the power to administer local affairs and also performed\njudicial functions such as dealing with petty offenses and resolving disputes.\n\n1\n\n2\n\nLecturer, Department of Public Administration, Faculty of Management Studies and Commerce,\nUniversity of Sri Jayewardenepura, Nugegoda, Sri Lanka.\n\nLecturer,  Department  of  Business  Economics,  Faculty  of  Management  Studies  and  Commerce,\nUniversity of Sri Jayewardenepura, Nugegoda, Sri Lanka.\n\n3 Village councils prevailed in ancient Sri Lanka.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n103\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f104\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nLocal  government  today  is  an  expanded  version  of  such  responsibilities,\noperating under the democratic system of governance. There are three types\nof  local  authorities\u2014municipal  councils,  urban  councils,  and  pradeshiya\nsabhas4\u2014under the administrative supervision of the provincial councils. The\nvarious  aspects  of  their  establishment  and  operation  are  covered  by  the\nMunicipal  Council  Ordinance,  the  Urban  Council  Ordinance,  and  the\nPradeshiya Sabhas Act.\n\nReview of the Literature\n\nWhat is citizen participation? According to Parry (1992, page 16; cited\nin Lowndes and Pratchett, 2002, page 2), it is taking part in the formulation,\npassage, and implementation of public policies. Parry\u2019s definition of citizen\nparticipation as political participation emphasizes the actions taken by citizens\nseeking to influence the decisions ultimately taken by local public officials\nand elected representatives. Defined this way, citizen participation includes\nnot only participating in electoral activities but also contacting public officials,\njoining protest actions, and getting involved, either formally or informally, in\nlocal issues (Brady et al. 1995, pages 272\u2013273; cited in Lowndes and Pratchett\n2002, page 2).\n\nAccording to Leatherman and Howell (2000, page 1), local officials rely\non citizen input to stay informed about public concerns and to gain insight\ninto  citizen  preferences. They  add  that  citizen  participation  is  at  work  if\ninformation flows from the electorate to the decision maker. Moreover, there\nis  a  direct  relationship  between  the  freedom  of  information  and  citizen\nparticipation in a country (Participation and Civic Engagement Group-World\nBank 2000, page 1). Freedom of information, including access to information,\nis essential for transparent and accountable government. Access to information\nenables the citizens (the clientele) to be involved in formulating social policies\nand making governance decisions, and ultimately restores societal harmony.\nOnly with adequate information can people discuss and debate the activities\nof  their  governments. Therefore,  the  right  to  information  is  increasingly\nrecognized as a fundamental human right, protected under international and\nconstitutional  law.  The  local  people  should  have  equal  opportunity  to\ncommunicate their views and suggestions regardless of ethnicity, religion, social\nstatus,  gender  and  other  characteristics. The  World  Bank  (2000,  page  2)\nadvocates the same equity principle.\n\n4 A local government authority in Sri Lanka.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n104\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fRelationship between the Size of Local Government and Citizen Participation in Sri Lanka\n\n105\n\nThe  system  of  local  government  is  itself  a  way  of  encouraging  citizen\nparticipation in public decision making. As Franklin and Ebdon (2002, page 1)\nput  it,  local  government  has  the  best  opportunity  to  promote  face-to-face\ninteraction  between  the  elected  officials  and  the  public.  Hence,  there  is  a\nstrong tradition of fostering citizens\u2019 involvement in local political decision\nmaking. Allowing citizens\u2019 groups to decide how resources should be allocated\nis thought to foster high levels of social capital (Putnam 1993; cited in Franklin\nand  Ebdon  2002,  page  1).  In  social  capital  theory,  the  clients  are  the  key\nstakeholders of government programs and their input is solicited since they\nare most likely to be affected by the decisions made.\n\nSeveral  expectations  and  prescriptions  guide  citizens\u2019  participation  in\nresource allocation. Franklin and Ebdon (2002, page 2) suggest four groups\nof factors that determine the level of citizen participation in decision making\nby a particular local government:\n\nStructure of the local government unit;\nParticipants;\n\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127) Mechanisms of participation; and\nProcess of public participation.\n(cid:127)\n\nThe  size  of  the  local  authority  is  part  of  the  structure. The  other\ncomponents are the form of government and the legal requirements for input\ninto government.\n\nWith respect to the participants, the local government officials have to\n\nconsider who will participate and who will identify and invite them.\n\nFranklin  and  Ebdon  (2002,  page  4)  mention  public  hearings,  public\nmeetings,  citizen  surveys,  citizen  juries,  and  Web  surveys  among  the\nmechanisms that countries generally use to get people\u2019s views. In the choice of\nmechanism, Franklin notes, timing is important. People must be given enough\ntime to express their views before the local administration decides. Another\nconsideration is the scope of the material to be presented. Citizens will be\nactive  when  the  discussion  concerns  neighborhood  issues,  Gurwitt  (1992,\npages 48\u201354; cited in Franklin and Ebdon 2002, page 4) points out. He adds\nthat participation tends to improve when there are several mechanisms for it.\nThe last group of factors considers the logistics of the process itself. A\ncommon barrier to meaningful participation, say Frisby and Bowman (1996,\npage 78), is lack of knowledge. Therefore, designing a participation process\nthat provides the information necessary to educate and inform the participants,\nin a language they understand, is an important first step in finding out their\npreferences.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n105\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f106\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nConcept of the Study\n\nThe study tested the assumption that the size of the local authority and\nthe population covered (independent variables) influence the level of public\nparticipation (dependent variable), which in turn leads to societal harmony.\nThe determinants of size that were considered were average total expenditure\nper  year  (both  recurrent  and  capital  expenditure)  and  number  of  staff\n(executive,  nonexecutive,  and  temporary),  contractors,  and  suppliers.\nFigure 1 shows the framework of the study.\n\nFigure 1: Framework of the Study\n\n \n\nAverage Expenditure  \nper Year  \n\nSize of the Staff\n\n \n\nNumber of  Grama Niladhari\nDivisions  \n\n \n\nPopulation  \n\nArea (km2)\n\nSource: Authors\u2019 research.\n\nSize of the \nAuthority  \n\nSize of the \nService Area  \n\nLevel of Citizen \nParticipation\n\nSocietal\nHarmony\n\nSignificance of the Study\n\nSri Lanka has a well-organized system of local government administration\nwith powers, functions, and duties vested by ordinances and a host of other\nsubsidiary  legislation.  During  the  pre-independence  period  and  more\nspecifically during the second half of British colonial rule, local government\ninstitutions  in  Sri  Lanka  were  greatly  influenced  by  local  government\ndevelopments and practices in the United Kingdom (Abeywardana 1992, pages\n116\u2013126). Thus,  the  local  government  authorities  in  Sri  Lanka  including\nmunicipal councils, urban councils, and pradeshiya sabhas have become more\nexpansive and bureaucratic.\n\nAccording to Nanayakkara (1992, page 3), two main principles of local\ngovernment should be taken into account. One is access by the community,\nwhich means the institutional capacity to utilize the views of the community\nthrough  the  direct  involvement  of  the  citizens  in  local  planning,  project\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n106\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fRelationship between the Size of Local Government and Citizen Participation in Sri Lanka\n\n107\n\nimplementation,  and  other  areas  of  decision  making.  The  capacity  of\ngovernment to promote access, Nanayakkara (1992, page 3) says, is inversely\nrelated  to  the  size  of  the  governing  bodies. The  second  principle  of  local\ngovernment is service, and it is related to the principle of access. The service\nprinciple suggests that local government has to achieve technical adequacy\naligned with community needs and interests. In the Sri Lankan context, the\nquestion to be asked in this regard is how far devolution and decentralization\nhave taken place.\n\nTherefore, to ensure effective citizen participation in local government\ndecision making and provide better services, the governing bodies and their\nclientele must be of a \u201cproper size.\u201d This empirical study set out to see whether\nthere is indeed a negative relationship between the level of citizen participation\nand the size of the governing bodies, and to gain an understanding of other\nfactors  that  can  affect  the  capacity  of  the  authorities  to  promote  effective\ncommunity participation.\n\nMethodology\n\nThis research combined qualitative and quantitative research techniques.\nThe population of the study consisted of all three types of local government\nauthorities in Sri Lanka\u2014municipal councils, urban councils, and pradeshiya\nsabhas\u2014and their clientele. As of 2003, Sri Lanka had 14 municipal councils,\n37  urban  councils,  and  258  pradeshiya  sabhas  (Department  of  Public\nAdministration 2003, page 124). One local government institution of each\ntype in the capital, Colombo, was selected. The three institutions were: Sri\nJayewardenepura Kotte Municipal Council, Maharagama Urban Council, and\nHomagama Pradeshiya Sabha. A representative sample of the clientele (general\npublic, government organizations, community-based organizations, private\nsector, and nongovernment organizations) was also drawn through stratified\nrandom sampling.\n\nOfficials of institutions were interviewed with the aid of a structured\nquestionnaire and an interview guide (Appendix 1). Beneficiaries were also\ninterviewed and observed. Secondary sources of information supplemented\nthe primary sources.\n\nIndices  of  the  size  of  the  governing  body,  service  area,  and  public\nparticipation were used. Scatter diagrams and a simple linear regression model\nwere constructed, with the size of the governing body and the size of service\narea  as  independent  variables  and  the  level  of  citizen  participation  as  the\ndependent variable. The results obtained through the regression model were\ncompared  with  the  results  of  the  interviews  conducted  with  officials  and\nbeneficiaries.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n107\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\f108\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nThe  index  of  the  size  of  governing  body  was  based  on  recurrent\nexpenditure  and  workforce.  Recurrent  expenditure\u2014expenses  incurred  to\nmaintain current activities\u2014\u201cplays a more important role in determining the\nsize of the institution than the level of capital expenditure\u201d (Central Bank of\nSri Lanka 2002, pages 50\u201356) and was therefore used to determine the size of\nthe governing body. Generally, the recurrent expenditures of local government\ninstitutions in Sri Lanka cover salaries and wages of employees, transportation,\nsupplies and instruments, maintenance of capital assets, interest, dividends\nand  bonuses,  subsidies  and  donations,  and  pensions  and  gratuities. These\nitems are divided among five major programs as follows:\n\n(cid:127) Common administration and staffing;\n(cid:127) Health services;\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127) Common utility services; and\n(cid:127) Welfare facilities.\n\nLand and buildings;\n\nThe  size  of  the  labor  force  of  the  local  authority  was  also  taken  into\naccount. The labor force was divided into three categories, namely, executive\nstaff, nonexecutive staff, and contractual employees. These categories of the\nlabor force comprised the subcategories listed in Table 1.\n\nThe index of the size of the service area of local authorities was based on\nthe population, grama niladhari divisions,5 and the area covered (in square\nkilometers).\n\nGetting Citizens to Participate\n\nLocal  authorities  in  Sri  Lanka  use  three  methods\u2014formal  meetings,\ndiscussions,  and  questionnaires\u2014to  get  the  views  of  their  clientele. The\nCommissioner of the Sri Jayewardenepura Municipal Council had this to say:\n\nThe views of the public are considered when designing projects to address\ncrucial issues such as garbage clearing. We discuss such matters informally,\nparticularly with the business community, and occasionally with the general\npublic.

Apart from that, questionnaires are distributed among the clientele\nto get their views when and where necessary. (3 October 2005 survey)\n\nIn comparison, following a survey of local authorities in England between\nMarch  and  July  2002  (with  a  55%  response  rate),  Curtain  (2003,  page  2)\nidentified a wider variety of tools and processes for enlisting citizen participation,\nas follows:\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n109\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\f110\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\n(cid:127) More  traditional  forms  of  consultation  such  as  public  meetings,\nconsultation documents, co-option into committees, and question-\nand-answer sessions;\n\n(cid:127) Customer feedback through service satisfaction surveys and complaint\n\n(cid:127)\n\nand suggestion schemes;\nInnovative  methods  of  participation  such  as  interactive Web  sites,\ncitizens\u2019 panels, focus group discussions, and referendums; and\n(cid:127) Approaches  that  encourage  citizens  to  deliberate  issues  through\ncitizens\u2019  juries,  community  plans  and  needs  analysis,  visioning\nexercises, and issue forums.\n\nThe choice of method is dictated by the goals of citizen participation\nand the desired citizen input. According to Leatherman and Howell (2000,\npages 1\u20132), the following are common purposes for which citizen input is\nsought and the methods that are generally effective in achieving the task:\n\nCommunity meetings and public hearings. Open gatherings of people\nfrom the community who wish to be heard about a topic or issue. A public\nhearing is often formal, with statements going into an official record of the\nmeeting. A community meeting will often be an informal gathering where\npeople come to share ideas with local officials.\n\nFocus groups. Small gatherings of stakeholders who meet in a confidential\nsetting to discuss an issue or react to a proposal. These meetings are often\nfacilitated by a trained individual. Participants are typically asked to respond\nto open-ended questions intended to initiate a discussion among the group.\nWorkshops. Meetings focused on the accomplishment of a predetermined\ntask. Primary stakeholders are often involved because of a high level of interest\nin the issue, but the full range of interests should be represented. Rather than\nsoliciting general opinion, workshops are intended to focus on specific concerns\nand produce a predetermined product. The benefit of such meetings is that\nthose most directly affected by an issue are directly involved in addressing it.\nTask forces. Small (usually 8 to 20 people) ad hoc citizen committees\nformed to complete a clearly defined task in the planning process. A task force\nis often appointed to study a particular issue and offer a report of findings and\nrecommendations  to  the  policy-making  body. They  often  function  under\ndeadlines.\n\nPriority-setting committees. Citizens\u2019 groups appointed to advise local\nofficials regarding citizens\u2019 ideas and concerns in planning community projects.\nParticipants are trusted to represent the concerns of citizens and sometimes\nact as a \u201cgo between\u201d with the local government.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n110\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fRelationship between the Size of Local Government and Citizen Participation in Sri Lanka\n\n111\n\nPolicy Delphi. A technique for developing and expressing the views of a\npanel of citizens chosen for their knowledge about an issue. The objective is\nto work toward a consensus of opinion that can be used by policy makers in\ndecision making. Successive rounds of presented arguments and counterpoints\nmove the group toward consensus, or at least to clearly established positions\nand supporting arguments.\n\nInterviews,  polls,  and  surveys.  Potentially  less  threatening  means  by\nwhich citizens can speak directly with someone about their views. Detailed\ninformation can be gathered. It can be informative in both content and overall\nreaction to an issue. To be valid and representative, this method requires a\ntrained survey taker to maintain confidentiality and statistical reliability.\n\nMedia-based  issue  balloting.  Coupled  with  a  media-based  effort  to\ndiscuss alternatives and consequences of potential solutions. Citizens are asked\nto respond through the local media. Letters to editors or radio call-in shows\nare monitored to gain a sense of the public reaction. It can be a good way to\ngain a quick reaction to proposals from those most likely to be active on an\nissue.\n\nCitizen advisory boards. Appointed groups of representatives of one or\nmore  community  interests.  An  advisory  board  studies  an  issue  and  makes\nrecommendations to policy makers. The range of decision-making authority\ncan vary and, in some cases, may be binding.\n\nReferendums.  Direct  and  binding  decision-making  authority  by  the\nelectorate. For highly controversial issues or where uncertainty exists about\nthe overall sentiment of the community, decision makers sometimes allow the\nissues to be decided in referendums.\n\nThe very limited and rudimentary methods of public participation in\nSri Lanka drew this comment from the Secretary of the Maharagama Urban\nCouncil:\n\nEven though we have highlighted the term \u201cpublic participation\u201d in our\nmission statement, corporate plan, and other documents, that is, in fact,\nthe most neglected by us in our duties. (29 September 2005)\n\nThe  citizens  have  no  access  to  an  elected  representative  at  the  local\ngovernment office. Instead, they meet a bureaucrat, a career official who may\nbe unresponsive to their grievances (Nanayakkara 1989, page 276). One reason\nfor this neglect could be that local government officials have not been trained\nfor citizen participation. Such training should be part of a properly organized\nmechanism of citizen participation.

As mentioned earlier, recurrent\nexpenditure and workforce were considered in determining the size of the\nauthority.\n\nTo understand the relationship between the two indices, a scatter diagram\n\nwas created out of the computed values (Figure 2).\n\nThe diagram shows a nonlinear relationship between the size and the\nlevel of citizen participation in the three types of local governmental authorities\nin the country: municipal councils, urban councils, and pradeshiya sabhas.\nThe regression line was constructed by converting the values into logarithms\nas follows:\n\nY = -14.712ln (X) + 68.636\n\nwhere Y is the level of citizen participation and X is the size of the local authority.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n112\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fRelationship between the Size of Local Government and Citizen Participation in Sri Lanka\n\n113\n\nTable 2: Citizen Participation Index (CPI)\n\nLocal\nGovernment\nAuthority/\nYear\n\nNo. of\nNo. of\nFormal\nProjects\nMeetings Discussions Are Distributed Adjusted\n\nNo.\nof\n\nNo. of\nTimes\nQuestionnaires\n\n(X1)\n\n(X2)\n\n (X3)\n\n(X4)\n\nSri Jayewardenepura Municipal Council\n10\n12\n9\n\n2002\n2003\n2004\n\n21\n18\n17\n\nMaharagama Urban Council\n\n2002\n2003\n2004\n\n2002\n2003\n\n2004\n\n11\n11\n9\n\n16\n22\n\n18\n\nHomagama Pradeshiya Sabha\n\n11\n18\n17\n\n20\n20\n\n18\n\n4\n6\n5\n\n5\n5\n5\n\n5\n7\n\n5\n\nNo. of\nProjects\n Implemented\nIrrespective\nof Views of\nClientele\n(X5)\n\nCPI\n\n3333333333\n3232323232\n3333333333\n\n2727272727\n3535353535\n3434343434\n\n4646464646\n5757575757\n5252525252\n\n5\n6\n4\n\n4\n4\n4\n\n3\n2\n\n\u2014\n\n3\n2\n6\n\n4\n5\n7\n\n8\n10\n\n11\n\nSource:  Interviews  on  29  September  and  3  October  2005  with  the  Secretaries  of  the  Sri  Jayewardenepura  Municipal\nCouncil, the Maharagama Urban Council, and Homagama Pradeshiya Sabha with additions by authors.\n\nThe value of R2 stands for the extent to which the size of the local authority\naffects the level of citizen participation in local authorities. The R2 value of\n0.625 indicates that 62.5% of the variation of the level of citizen participation\nis due to the variation in the size of the local authorities. Hence, in Sri Lanka,\nthe size of the authorities can be used to explain the level of public participation\nin local government institutions.\n\nThe slope of the regression line shows the degree of relationship between\nthe size of the local authorities and the level of public participation.

If we were to\nhave a large budget, that would lead to a larger staff, and maintaining the\nPradeshiya  Sabha  itself  would  become  an  issue.  So,  we  don\u2019t  utilize  a\nlarger staff to maintain registers, accounts, ledgers, and other documents.\nRather, more officials are utilized to work with the community. (3 October\n2005 survey)\n\nOn the other hand, a client of Homagama Pradeshiya Sabha had these\ncomments about the quality of the services rendered by the pradeshiya sabha:\n\nHomagama Pradeshiya Sabha is a very familiar public office to us.

(3 October 2005 survey)\n\nA large budget and a large workforce evidently hinder public participation\nand thereby dilute societal harmony. The internal processes of such institutions\nuse up a large amount of resources, and not enough is left for participatory\nmeetings and discussions. According to Peiris (1992, page 6), local government\nis participatory democracy, and that should be the main objective of local\ngovernment  institutions.  Hence,  local  authorities  should  focus  more  on\nstakeholder management. But local authorities in Sri Lanka are more concerned\nwith  maintaining  their  internal  business  processes.

They have very limited opportunities to meet the Mayor\nand  other  elected  officials,  and  this  is  very  unfortunate.  (29  September\n2005 survey)\n\nAs organizations become larger, there is progressively less opportunity to\n\npromote citizen participation in decision making.\n\nThe relationship between the size of the service area and the level of\ncitizen participation was also determined. The service area was calculated by\nconsidering the size of the population served, the number of grama niladhari\ndivisions  under  each  local  authority,  and  the  size  of  the  local  authority  in\nsquare kilometers (km2). Table 4 gives the index of the size of the service area\n(Appendix 2) and the CPI.\n\nAgain,  a  simple  regression  model  was  constructed  to  analyze  the\nrelationship  between  the  two  variables.  The  size  of  the  service  area  was\nconsidered the independent variable, and the citizen participation index, the\ndependent variable. Figure 3 shows the scatter diagram and the regression line\nplotted.\n\nA linear relationship between the two variables is observed. The regression\n\nequation can therefore be established as follows:\n\nY = 2.3931X + 21.229\n\nwhere X is the index of size of service area and Y is the citizen participation\n\nindex.\n\nSince R2 is equal to 0.7162, around 72% of the variation in the level of\ncitizen participation in local authorities in Sri Lanka can be attributed to a\nvariation in the size of the service area. The slope of +2.391 indicates a positive\nrelationship  between  the  size  of  the  service  area  and  the  level  of  citizen\nparticipation in the local authorities in Sri Lanka. As the size of the service\narea increases, so does the level of citizen participation, and vice versa. This\ncharacteristic of local authorities in Sri Lanka is shown in Figure 4.\n\nThus, a small governing body with a large service area will have a high\nlevel  of  citizen  participation.  The  pradeshiya  sabha,  the  smallest  local\ngovernment  organization,  serves  a  very  large  area.  Its  level  of  citizen\nparticipation and societal harmony is very high. A municipal council, on the\nother  hand,  is  very  large  but  serves  a  very  small  area.  Its  level  of  citizen\nparticipation is very low, and societal harmony is neglected.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n116\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fRelationship between the Size of Local Government and Citizen Participation in Sri Lanka\n\n117\n\nTable 4: Index of the Size of Service Area and Calculated CPI\n\nAuthority/Year\n\nIndex of Size of Authority\n\nCPI\n\nSri Jayewardenepura Kotte Municipal Council\n\n2002\n2003\n2004\n\n2002\n2003\n2004\n\n2002\n2003\n2004\n\nMaharagama Urban Council\n\nHomagama Pradeshiya Sabha\n\n11\n12\n12\n\n7\n7\n7\n\n3\n3\n4\n\n33\n32\n33\n\n27\n35\n34\n\n46\n57\n52\n\nSource:  Interviews  on  29  September  and  3  October  2005  with  the  Secretaries  of  the  Sri  Jayewardenepura  Municipal\nCouncil, the Maharagama Urban Council, and Homagama Pradeshiya Sabha with additions by authors.\n\nFigure 3: Relationship between Index of the Size of Service Area and CPI\n\nn\no\ni\nt\na\np\ni\nc\ni\nt\nr\na\nP\n \nc\ni\nl\nb\nu\nP\n\n \nf\no\n \nx\ne\nd\nn\nI\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0\n\nY = 2.3931X + 21.229\n\n2\n = 0.7162\n\nR\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nIndex of Size of the Service Area\n\nIndex of Public Participation\n\nLog.

There is an inverse relationship between the size of the governing\nbodies and the level of citizen participation, but it is a negligible one. In other\nwords, in a participatory democracy, local government institutions, whatever\ntheir size, should be able to accommodate the views of their clientele when\nand where necessary. However, there is a positive correlation between the size\nof the service area of local authorities and the level of citizen participation.\n\nSmall local government institutions with a large service area are better\nparticipatory  institutions.  On  the  other  hand,  large  local  government\ninstitutions with a small service area are poor in citizen participation in decision\nmaking.\n\nMost often, Sri Lankan local government institutions pay more attention\nto managing their internal business processes. Thus, they have largely neglected\nto consider the views of their clientele. When they do get the opinions of the\npeople,  the  local  authorities  in  Sri  Lanka  use  traditional  methods  such  as\ndiscussions, interviews, and questionnaires, and not the more comprehensive\nand sophisticated methods of citizen participation that are commonplace in\nthe developed world.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n118\n\n20/11/2006, 3:03 PM\n\n\fRelationship between the Size of Local Government and Citizen Participation in Sri Lanka\n\n119\n\nReferences\n\nAbeyawardana,  H.

The lack of harmony in these continents has often\nmanifested itself in conflicts such as wars between countries or between ethnic\ngroups fighting for control over resources (arable land, water, minerals, etc.),\nreligious dominance, or monopoly of state power (Maganga 2002). As harmony\ndeclines in these societies, social tensions emerge and the potential for conflict\nincreases. Finally wars break out, people get killed, and citizens flee their homes\nand countries for safer havens. They ultimately become refugees.\n\nFor more than 40 years societal harmony in Africa has been in serious\ncrisis. Since the 1970s more than 30 wars have been fought on the continent,\nmost of them between states. Fourteen of Africa\u2019s 53 countries were afflicted\nby armed conflicts in 1966 alone. These accounted for more than half of all\nwar-related deaths worldwide, and more than 8 million refugees, returnees,\nand  displaced  persons  (Guest  2004).  In  the  last  four  decades,  Africa  has\nproduced 9.5 million refugees and, worse, hundreds and thousands of people\nhave been slaughtered as a result of these conflicts. For instance, until July\n2004, in Darfur, Sudan, the Arab militia\u2014the janjaweed\u2014killed as many as\n30,000 people and left more than a million others displaced (see Dousing the\nFlames of Darfur, in The Economist, 3\u20139 July 2004, page 13).\n\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo 3.3 million people have been\nkilled in various wars. In 1994 close to a million people (Tutsi and moderate\nHutus) were killed in what is now known as the \u201cRwanda Genocide.\u201d This is\nwithout  mentioning  what  has  taken  place  in  Angola,  Burundi,  Ethiopia,\nEritrea,  Nigeria,  Sierra  Leone,  Somalia,  and  Uganda. Wars  have  also  been\nrecorded in the former Yugoslavia, between the Serbs, Croats, and Bosnians.\nIn Sri Lanka, two ethnic groups\u2014the Sinhalese and the Tamils\u2014have waged\nwars against each other that have left so many people dead (Bowen 1996).\n\n1\n\nSenior Lecturer and Director, Institute of Public Administration, Mzumbe University, Tanzania.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n123\n\n20/11/2006, 3:04 PM\n\n\f124\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nThis paper looks at how public administration can create conditions for\npreventing  the  emergence  of  the  conflicts  briefly  outlined  above  and  can\ntherefore promote harmony in society. It reviews the major initiatives that\nTanzania\u2019s  public  administration  has  taken  to  create  relative  harmony  and\nstability  over  the  years,  and  presents  some  lessons  for  reflection.  More\nspecifically, it describes the major local government structures that Tanzania\u2019s\nGovernment has put in place to ensure that societal harmony is maintained as\na key condition for socioeconomic development. The paper has seven main\nsections:  (i)  the  introduction,  where  the  purpose  of  the  paper  is  outlined;\n(ii) a discussion of key conceptual/theoretical issues related to societal harmony\nand public administration; (iii) a discussion of some theoretical requirements\nfor societal harmony to exist; (iv) a look at how colonial administrations created\nthe  potential  for  disharmony  in Tanzania;  (v)  a  focus  on Tanzania\u2019s  local\ngovernment system structures that have been put in place to promote societal\nharmony; (vi) some lessons for reflection; and (vii) conclusions.\n\nConceptual Issues\n\nSocietal harmony has been defined as a state of peaceful existence and\nagreement (Hornby 2000). The concepts \u201cpeaceful existence\u201d and \u201cagreement\u201d\nimply the presence or existence of diversity in society, as well as the mechanisms\nto  harmonize  diversities  for  better  and  productive  uses.  Diversity,  broadly\nviewed, may mean citizens who differ in social status, personal perspectives,\nlevel of education, socioeconomic needs, and access to power as well as public\ngoods and services. Diversity may also mean differences in natural endowments:\nsome  parts  of  the  country  may  be  better  endowed  with  resources  such  as\nminerals, rivers, forests, pastureland, and socioeconomic infrastructure than\nother parts of the same country. With such diversity in society, there is always\na struggle for access and therefore a potential for conflicts to arise and thus for\nharmony to fade. This means that certain mechanisms must be put in place to\ncontain or resolve such conflicts for societal harmony to exist.\n\nCrum (1987, page 29), for instance, writes:\n\nConflict  appears  everywhere. We  find  it  in  our  personal  lives  at  home,\nbetween parent and child and between spouses. We find it at work between\nemployer  and  employee.  It  is  there  between  man  and  woman.  We  see\nreligion against religion, nation against nation. It is the underlying theme\nthroughout all human history. With the increasing complexity of life on\nthis  planet,  the  exploding  human  population,  and  our  possession  of\nawesome weapons, which could trigger our total annihilation, conflict has\nbecome the critical issue of our time.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n124\n\n20/11/2006, 3:04 PM\n\n\fLocal Government Structures for Strengthening Societal Harmony in Tanzania\n\n125\n\nCrum contends that it is not whether one has conflict in one\u2019s life, it is\nwhat one does with that conflict that makes a difference. Shonholtz (1998)\nsees  conflict  and  democracy  as  inseparable.  He  argues  that  democracy\nlegitimates conflicts that are peacefully expressed and resolved. In a democratic\nsociety, according to Schonholtz, conflict can make the entire society aware\nthat new normative rules must be set to effect orderly change.\n\nSlaikeu and Hasson (1998) argue that conflict itself is not the problem,\nbut unresolved conflict is. The two scholars see conflict as an integral dynamic\nin the growth and development of living organisms and groups. Conflict occurs\nwhen the ideas, interests, or behavior of two or more individuals or groups\nclash.\n\nBowen (1996) addresses the causes of societal disharmony, while focusing\nmore on ethnic conflicts. He dismisses the view that the world\u2019s present conflicts\nare fueled by age-old ethnic loyalties and cultural differences. This view, he\nsays, is based on three mistaken assumptions: first, that ethnic identities are\nprimordial and unchanging; second, that these identities motivate people to\npersecute and kill; and finally, that ethnic diversity itself inevitably leads to\nviolence. Bowen argues that this view misrepresents the genesis of conflict\nand ignores the ability of diverse people to coexist. Diverse identities coexisted\nthroughout history without necessarily leading to conflicts, he adds. Moreover,\nsociety has always designed mechanisms to contain and resolve differences.\n\nTo Bowen, conflicts in Burundi, Rwanda, Sri Lanka, and the former\nYugoslavia resulted from the creation by political leaders of elite and nonelite\nclasses with varying access to public services and benefits, including state power.\nThe  creation,  for  example,  of  the  Tutsi  elites  by  the  Belgian  colonial\nadministration in Rwanda led to the emergence of antagonistic relationships\nbetween the Tutsi elites and the nonelites (the Bahutu and Batwa). The same\nhappened  in  Sri  Lanka,  where  the  British  colonial  administration  created\nSinhalese elites against the Tamils. Therefore, what Bowen is saying is that\nsocial differentiation is inherent in human society, but it can be used by ruling\nelites either for positive ends such as forging a strong social consensus for the\ndevelopment of society or for negative ends such as spawning interethnic or\ninterstate conflicts for their own political gain or other reasons. This means\nthat politics and public administration can either create and sustain societal\nharmony or destroy it.\n\nPublic administration is therefore another key concept where societal\nharmony is concerned. McSwite (1997) looks at public administration as the\nstudy and work of management in public organizations, and the study and\nwork of leadership in those organizations. Bennis (1993) says that managers\nand  administrators  focus  on  doing  their  work  right,  while  leadership  is\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n125\n\n20/11/2006, 3:04 PM\n\n\f126\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nconcerned with selecting the right programs, policies, values, and goals. Bennis\ncontends that in today\u2019s environment, it makes more sense to describe public\nadministration as the practice and theory of doing the right things the right\nway in the service of society. In short, the task of public administration is both\nto manage and to lead.\n\nBehn (1998), Terry (1995), Selznick (1983), and Denhardt (1981) discuss\nin detail the role of leadership and public administration in society. They all\nagree  that  leaders  motivate,  mobilize,  and  inspire  the  citizens  to  support\nprograms  for  implementation.  Public  administration  redefines  the  policies\nand programs and crafts strategies for putting these into practice, for the public\nbenefit. According to Perry and Keller (1991), public administration has three\ncomponents: administrators, the human side of the government bureaucracy\nand a source of action; structures, or the framework within which decisions\nare  processed  and  implemented,  views  are  exchanged,  and  information  is\nshared; and procedures for carrying out mandated activities.\n\nSo far, our review of the literature has served to remind us of a number\nof issues. First, the concept of \u201csocietal harmony\u201d assumes diversity in society\nand,  therefore,  the  possibility  of  conflict.  Second,  where  social  diversity  is\nconcerned, the key issue is not to stop conflicts from happening but rather to\nharmonize  the  various  divergences  toward  a  common  agreement  for  the\nbetterment of society. Third, public administration is a critical institution in\nthe promotion and sustainability of society harmony.  Finally, societal harmony\nis a value that public administration must purposively create and sustain.\n\nRequirements for Societal Harmony: Some Theoretical\nConsiderations\n\nSocietal  harmony  is  a  result  of  many  factors.  First,  it  assumes  a\ncommitment by the society to guarantee the safety and security of its members\nincluding their property. Secure people will have peace of mind, settle down,\nand live without worries or fear. They can concentrate on productive work for\ntheir own betterment as well as for the development of society as a whole. The\npeople in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or the Sudan can hardly be\nexpected to settle down and live harmoniously. Societal harmony does not\nexist where members of society constantly live under the threat of war, torture,\ndisplacement, or dispossession.\n\nThe second factor is political will. People in leadership positions must\nwillingly and consciously show that they are committed to creating peace and\nharmony in society. Unless the leaders do this, the followers are not likely to\nhave peace and harmony. What is happening in Burundi, Somalia, the Sudan,\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n126\n\n20/11/2006, 3:04 PM\n\n\fLocal Government Structures for Strengthening Societal Harmony in Tanzania\n\n127\n\nand Uganda is a leadership crisis in which the leaders, mainly for self-serving\nreasons, refuse to show the political will to end the armed conflicts in their\ncountries. In Uganda, President Yoweri Museven has persistently turned down\nmeetings with the Lord Resistance Army fighters, who virtually control the\nnorthern part of Uganda and have engaged the regime in armed conflict for\nmore than 10 years. If the belligerent sides can meet and discuss their differences\nhonestly, peace and harmony will be possible.\n\nThe third factor is equity. Hobbes (1651) wrote on this subject:\n\nThe safety of the people, requireth, further, from him, or them that have\nthe sovereign power, that justice be equally administered to all degrees of\npeople; that is, that as well the rich and mighty, as poor and obscure persons,\nmay be righted of the injuries done to them; so as the great, may have no\ngreater hope of impunity, when they do violence, dishonor, on any injury\nto the meaner sort, than when one of these, does the like to one of them:\nfor  in  this,  consisteth  equity,  to  which  as  being  a  precept  of  the  law  of\nnature, a sovereign is as much subject, as any of the meanest of his people.\n\nTherefore, the role of the political leadership in society is to formulate\npolicies that ensure that all members of society have equal access to public\nservices  and  goods.  Distributive  and  redistributive  policies  are  one  way  of\nattaining social equity. On the other hand, preferential treatment of one part\nof the population by politicians or administrators to the neglect of other parts\nis unfair and is likely to create discord.\n\nThe fourth factor is citizens\u2019 participation in political and governmental\ndecision making. Arguments for enhanced citizen participation often rest\non the merits of the process and the belief that an engaged citizenry is better\nthan a passive citizenry (Putman 1995, Arnstein 1969). It is also believed\nthat if the citizens participate, policies might be more realistically grounded\nin citizens\u2019 preferences, the public might be more sympathetic evaluators of\nthe tough decisions that government administrators have to make, and the\nimproved  support  from  the  public  might  smooth  divisions,  and  make  it\neasier to govern and regulate (Irvin and Stansbury 2004). Participation dispels\ninertia. The political leadership, for its part, must create an informed and\nactive citizenry by sensitizing society to its political and social rights and\nobligations, and mobilizing its members (Baregu 2001). But for all this to\nhappen,  there  must  be  relevant  structures  within  which  the  members  of\nsociety can elect their leaders, participate in resource allocation decisions,\nand air their views about the conduct of their leaders and the government in\ngeneral.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n127\n\n20/11/2006, 3:04 PM\n\n\f128\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nThe  fifth  factor  is  political  identity.  The  people,  individually  or\ncollectively, must be able to identify themselves with the state authorities and\nbe  able  to  support  their  political  or  economic  philosophies  and  strategies\n(Heater 1990). Political identity presupposes that the government is people-\ncentered and responsive to the needs of its citizens.\n\nThe sixth factor is education and training. The citizens must have the\nskills needed to carry out their responsibilities. Leading a nation whose citizens\nare illiterate and ignorant is difficult\u2014and expensive. Training can be in the\nareas  of  leadership,  citizen  mobilization  and  motivation,  management  of\nmeetings, conflict resolution, records management, or other fields that the\ngovernment may regard as critical.\n\nThe seventh is sustained growth of the economy and trade. The ability\nof a nation to produce enough commodities for internal consumption and\nfor export plays a very critical role in promoting societal harmony. Hungry\ncitizens cannot be productive and are hard to lead. Moreover, the production\nof commodities for export enables the country to earn foreign exchange that\nit  may  use  to  import  capital  goods  and  other  raw  materials  for  further\ninvestment and production. A weak economy cannot meet or sustain the needs\nof the citizens, and is thus a fertile ground for popular dissatisfaction as citizens\nchase fewer commodities and services while their needs overwhelmingly surpass\nthe commodities and services available. The government must therefore manage\nthe economy properly so that enough resources are generated to sustain the\nneeds of the citizens and the society as a whole.\n\nColonial Seeds of Disharmony\n\nBefore  we  look  at  the  structures  that Tanzania  has  put  in  place  to\nstrengthen harmony, we need to review a few historical issues about Tanzania.\nTanzania gained its independence on 9 December 1961, after more than 75\nyears  of  German  (1885\u20131918)  and  British  (1919\u20131961)  rule.  Like  most\nother colonial regimes, the Germany and British colonial administrations\ncreated social and economic imbalances to suit their colonial interests. This\nwas the policy of divide and rule. First, they created elitist classes based on\nrace (Europeans, Asians, and Africans), which had unequal access to public\ngoods and services. Europeans enjoyed the best access and Asians (mainly\nIndians) were dominant in the financial and commercial sectors. The vast\nmajority of Africans, however, occupied the lowest rung of the social ladder.\nA few Africans, mainly from chiefly lineage, were allowed limited access to\npublic goods and services. So at independence, tensions related to race and\ninequity were brewing. This was a challenge that the nationalist government\nhad to face and resolve.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n128\n\n20/11/2006, 3:04 PM\n\n\fLocal Government Structures for Strengthening Societal Harmony in Tanzania\n\n129\n\nSecond, the colonizers created imbalances in the ethnic structures of the\ncountry. Tanzania had and still has more than 125 ethnic groups, each one\nwith its own language. Development plans and strategies favored those ethnic\ngroups that resided in high places, such as those around Kilimanjaro Mountain,\nthe west lake region (i.e., Lake Victoria), the Southern Highlands region, and\nthe Indian Ocean coastal areas (from Tanga to a few kilometers south of Dar\nes Salaam). These areas had fertile land, sufficient rainfall, and cool weather.\nIncidentally,  in  these  same  places  the  European  settlers  established  private\nbusinesses (mainly coffee and sisal plantations), and allowed the establishment\nof missionary centers, which provided limited  social services such as education\nand  health  care,  besides  religious  ministry  (Christianity).  Road  and  rail\nnetworks were fairly developed in these regions. At independence, these areas\nwere far ahead of the rest of the regions in education, health care, and wealth.\nThey  had  also  developed  passionate  tribal  feelings  that  made  them  regard\nother tribes (especially those not \u201cfavored\u201d by the colonizers) as unwanted\nand inferior.\n\nThird, and related to the second factor, was the absence of a policy for\ninvesting in socioeconomic infrastructure to develop the entire territory. Places\nwhere there were settler plantations or mining facilities were well served by\nroads and railways. Hospitals, schools, and churches followed the European\nmissionaries. But the central, western, and southern regions of the territory\nwere completely ignored.\n\nFourth,  the  colonial  administration  did  not  allow  the  residents  to\nparticipate in central or local government processes. Policy and administration\nwere the exclusive monopoly of the colonial administration (European) officials.\nA small number of Asians (mainly Indians) had limited participation in colonial\nadministration. The development of political identity and national pride was\nthwarted.\n\nFifth, and related to the second and third factors above, the colonial\nadministration made no attempt to unite the people by introducing a common\nnational language. The Germans and the British promoted and used their\nown languages in official business. Very few local residents spoke these foreign\nlanguages. Every ethnic group spoke its own language. Linguistic parochialism\nreinforced  the  other  imbalances  and  severely  hampered  the  efforts  of  the\nnationalist government to build a nation.\n\nFinally,  and  directly  related  to  colonial  practices  in  Burundi,  the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, and Rwanda, was and still is the factor of\nrefugees. Tanzania has taken in close to a million refugees. The presence of\nthese refugees makes it even less likely that the Government, with its already\noverstretched capacity, can provide public goods and services to its own citizens.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n129\n\n20/11/2006, 3:04 PM\n\n\f130\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nThe refugees also cause environmental degradation by indiscriminately cutting\ndown trees and grass to build their dwellings, and pose a threat to security,\nwith the guns they illegally carry. Relations between local residents and the\nrefugees are uneasy and tense at best. Armed conflicts have broken out, and\npeople on both sides have been killed. Yet the refugees are unwilling to go\nback to the turmoil in their home countries.\n\nLocal Government Structures for Strengthening Societal Harmony\nin Tanzania\n\nThis paper deals mainly with local government in Tanzania. The local\ngovernment  system  is  patterned  after  the  British  model.  It  is  a  centralized\nsystem with limited decision making and financial autonomy. There are at\npresent 122 local authorities throughout the country. Acts of Parliament 7\nand 8 of 1982, which define the responsibilities of local authorities, provide\nthe legal framework of local government. In addition, sections 145(1)\u2013145(2)\nand 146(1)\u2013146(2) of the 1977 Constitution ordain the existence of local\ngovernment  to  promote  development  and  democracy  in  the  districts  and\nsubdistricts. Local authorities are either rural (district councils) or urban (city,\nmunicipal, and town councils). Directly under the district council is a ward,\nunder  which  there  are  the  village  governments  and,  under  each  village\ngovernment, a 10-house cell. Under the municipal or town council is a ward,\nand under that the mtaa (street government) and finally a 10-house cell. A\ncity council follows the same structure as these other two urban councils except\nthat it runs through a municipality.\n\nMore than 85% of Tanzania\u2019s population of 35 million (according to the\n2002 Census) is under local government. Because the vast majority of the\npeople live at this level, this is where most of the potential tensions discussed\nabove  are  most  strongly  felt.  Structures  must  therefore  be  put  in  place  to\nensure that tensions and disagreements are resolved and divergent views are\nharmonized. These structures are discussed below.\n\nThe Council\n\nThe  urban  or  district  council  is  the  supreme  elective  structure  that\nformulates and approves bylaws, the budget, and other development programs,\nand promotes representative democracy. Councilors elected by the citizens\nresiding in the wards bring the people\u2019s development concerns, views, and\ngrievances to the council for discussion and settlement. The council meets\nevery 3 months for this purpose. Councilors serve for a term of 5 years. Those\nwho do their work well are normally reelected. The residents\u2019 power to retain\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n130\n\n20/11/2006, 3:04 PM\n\n\fLocal Government Structures for Strengthening Societal Harmony in Tanzania\n\n131\n\ncouncilors in their posts compels the latter to be attentive to the residents\u2019\nconcerns. In this way harmony is promoted and strengthened at the grassroots\nlevel.\n\nThe council functions through committees responsible for finance and\nplanning, administration and establishment, social services, economic services,\nand education. The policies passed by the council are implemented by the\nadministrative staff under the director of the local authority, who is appointed\nby the council on the basis of merit.\n\nThe Ward Development Committee (WDC)\n\nThe ward is a political and administrative structure from which councilors\nare elected. Administratively, the ward functions under the ward executive\nofficer (WEO), who is appointed on the basis of merit by the council. The\nWEO  attends  to  the  day-to-day  management  of  the  ward,  including  the\nbuilding of roads, schools, and dispensaries and the resolution of conflicts\namong  the  residents. The  WEO  functions  under  the  ward  development\ncommittee,  whose  membership  is  made  up  of  the  ward  councilor,  street\ngovernment (mtaa) chairpersons, and council administrative staff responsible\nfor the various activities in the ward. No policy making takes place at the\nward level. The WDC is another grassroots structure that is well placed to\ndetect nascent conflicts and resolve them before they can endanger harmony.\nThe WDC meets every month to review the development status in the ward.\n\nThe Mtaa (Street) or Village Government\n\nThe mtaa (street) government exists under sections 14(1)\u201314(5) of Acts\nof Parliament Nos. 7 and 8 of 1982, and the village government under sections\n22(1)\u201322(3) of the same acts. Each of these local governments functions under\nan assembly in which all mtaa or village residents 18 years old and over can\nformulate and approve by-laws and policies for the development of the mtaa\nor village. The chairperson of the assembly is elected by the residents and is\nassisted in planning and carrying out approved policies by the mtaa or village\nexecutive officer. Like the local authority council, the mtaa or village assembly\nworks  through  committees,  each  of  which  deals  with  a  specific  functional\narea such as safety and security, education, health care, environment, women\nand  children,  water,  and  discipline.  The  assembly  likewise  promotes\nrepresentative  and  participative  democracy,  and  detects  and  resolves\ndisagreements among the residents.\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n131\n\n20/11/2006, 3:04 PM\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\f132\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nWard Land Tribunals and Village Land Councils\n\nLand is a resource for which every citizen strives to acquire for survival.\nAs  the  struggle  for  land  acquisition  goes  on,  the  likelihood  for  conflict  to\nemerge  increases.  To  forestall  such  potential  conflicts  the  Government\nestablished ward tribunals under the Act of Parliament No. 7 of 1985. The\nrole of ward tribunals is to receive, examine, and settle citizen disputes over\nland. In 2002, under the Land Dispute Settlement Act No.2, the Government\nestablished  village  land  councils,  whose  role  is  ensure  that  equity  in  land\nallocation is observed. The act also ensures that land so allocated is put to\nproductive use. Essentially, both the ward land tribunals as well as the village\ncouncils seek to maintain harmony at the ward and village levels by addressing\nresidents\u2019 land disputes before they turn into conflicts.\n\nThe 10-House Cell\n\nThe 10-house cell is the grassroots structure that is closest to the people.\nIn  this  structure,  10  households  work  under  a  chairperson,  whom  the\nhousehold  members  elect.  The  10-house  cell  mobilizes  residents  for\ndevelopment  activities  such  as  maintaining  general  cleanliness  in  the  area,\nand resolves disagreements among the household residents. The disagreements\nrelate mostly to demarcation between households, misunderstandings between\nspouses, drunken behavior, theft, and sexual abuse. Cases that demand higher\nexpertise are normally referred to the mtaa or village government committee\nfor action.\n\nSome Lessons for Reflection\n\nDespite the seeds of disharmony, Tanzania has been a model of relative\npeace and stability in Africa. Tanzania\u2019s public administration has managed to\ncontain and resolve local disagreements. From the foregoing, we can draw a\nnumber of lessons.\n\nFirst, the Tanzanian experience clearly shows that ethnic or geographical\ndiversity does not necessarily lead to societal disharmony. Tanzania\u2019s public\nadministration managed to unite the entire population, with more than 125\nethnic  groups,  by  developing  and  using  a  common  language,  Kiswahili.\nPredominantly  spoken  in  eastern,  southern,  and  central  Africa,  Kiswahili\nborrows  its  vocabulary  from  the  Bantu,  Arabic,  and  European  languages\nespecially  Italian,  German,  and  English.  More  than  90%  of  the  people  of\nTanzania now speak the language. Social identity has been strengthened and\nattempts to weaken peace and stability have been forestalled. Throughout the\nstruggle  for  independence  (1954\u20131961)  the  nationalist  leaders  strongly\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n132\n\n20/11/2006, 3:04 PM\n\n\fLocal Government Structures for Strengthening Societal Harmony in Tanzania\n\n133\n\npreached and emphasized the values of unity in Kiswahili. Ethnic parochialism\nand false notions of ethnic superiority were strongly condemned, and policies\nwere later formulated to help do away with such harmful attitudes. So the\nleadership factor is critical here.\n\nSecond, public administration with its expertise in human behavior and\nsocial science research should be able to investigate and find out the causes of\ndisharmony in society. Public administration must therefore devise and submit\nrelevant legislative proposals for this purpose, for approval and implementation.\nThird,  it  is  not  necessarily  true  that  the  wrongs  of  the  colonial\nadministrations cannot be corrected. The postindependence regimes should\nbe able to do away with the ethnic divisions.\n\nFourth, citizens\u2019 participation in the processes of government is critical\nin strengthening societal harmony. The public administration, in consultation\nwith stakeholders, should design appropriate structures to allow the people to\nexpress their views and concerns regarding policy issues. Only if the citizens,\ntoo, take ownership of the processes of government can they identify themselves\nwith the government and support it. The village assemblies, ward development\ncommittees,  and  local  authority  councils  are  some  of  the  structures  that\nTanzania\u2019s public administration has put in place to facilitate and promote\ncitizens\u2019 participation and representative democracy and ultimately strengthen\nsocietal harmony.\n\nFinally, the education of citizens is a must. It is difficult and expensive to\nlead an ignorant citizenry. Shortly after independence, Tanzania embarked on\na long-tem citizen education program, which involved full subsidy for primary,\nsecondary,  and  university  education. This  made  it  possible  for  children,\nespecially those from poor families, to acquire an education. Under the same\nprogram, all adults were compelled to register for literacy classes. At present,\n95% of the population can read and write. The citizens can understand their\nleaders and can question the soundness of their policies. They can also call on\ntheir leaders to explain their actions. The leaders are thus compelled to provide\ngood leadership. Sustainability mechanisms have been put in place to ensure\nthat these achievements do not die away. The public administration must\nanalyze training and determine the knowledge and skills required to achieve\nthe  society\u2019s  goals,  and  see  to  it  that  the  capacity-building  programs  are\ncarried out.\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n133\n\n20/11/2006, 3:04 PM\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\f134\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nConclusion\n\nSocietal harmony is a prerequisite for development. But it must be created\nand strengthened through purposeful public policies. Since societal harmony\nis for the people\u2019s benefit, the people should have a hand in its creation so that\nthey give it the proper value. They need structures through which they can\nhelp create societal harmony. Public administration should set up and sustain\nthose structures and generally facilitate the process of creating societal harmony.\nIt must have the political will to do what it ought to do.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession1.pmd\n\n134\n\n20/11/2006, 3:04 PM\n\n\fLocal Government Structures for Strengthening Societal Harmony in Tanzania\n\n135\n\nReferences\n\nArnstein, Sherry R. 1969.

Organizations  to  which  these  terms  are\napplied  can  include  social  and  sporting  clubs,  professional  associations,\nadvocacy groups, foundations, social service agencies, private schools, credit\nunions, and self-help groups. The organizations may: (i) vary in size from tens\nto thousands of people; (ii) be local to a small community or have branches\nthroughout the country; (iii) have budgets that range from hundreds to millions\nof dollars; (iv) undertake commercial activities; (v) have both paid staff and\nvolunteers, or volunteers only; (vi) provide services to nonmembers or not;\nand (vii) be governed by boards or committees elected by the members or\nappointed by sponsoring organizations.\n\nNonprofit organizations have a significant historical role in Australia,\nand, in some areas, a long-standing relationship with government. Nonprofit\nschools and assistance to the poor and the sick had the support of colonial\ngovernments,  and  were  funded  by  wealthy  individuals  or  churches  (Lyons\n1993). This history of government support of church-based welfare services\ndifferentiates Australia from the United States of America, where the recent\nfunding of faith-based services agencies has generated controversy. Nonprofit\norganizations play a significant role in the Australian economy, employing\n7.6% of the workforce and contributing 3% to gross domestic product in\n1996 (Lyons 2001).\n\nCommunity service organizations (CSOs) are a subset of the nonprofit\n\nsector comprising organizations that\n\n[P]rovide  support,  care,  encouragement  and  advice  for  people  in  a  way\nthat is primarily determined by them, involves some enduring pattern of\n\n1 Director of Studies and Programs, Flinders Institute of Public Policy and Management, Flinders\n\nUniversity, Adelaide, Australia.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n139\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f140\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\ninteraction and is designed to remove the need for support or to enable\npeople to achieve feasible independence or autonomy in their home and\ncommunity, or a setting that as closely resembles this as possible. (Lyons\n2001, page 33)\n\nSome services are provided by CSOs for a fee. But since many of the\nrecipients of services in the community services sector have limited income,\nsuch services are funded by government, individual donors, and corporate\ndonors, as well as by the service providers themselves, with revenue they raise\nthrough investments or business activities (Lyons 1997). Services may also be\nprovided by volunteers supervised by a paid staff member or another volunteer.\nIn Australia in 2000\u20132001, governments contributed 69.9% of the funding\nfor such services, with the balance coming from donations (individual and\ncorporate), fees, and sales of goods.\n\nThe relationship between CSOs and government encompasses more than\nfunding. In addition to providing some form of financial support, governments\nmay:\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\ninfluence the organization through its legislative framework, which\nmay be applicable to any organization, whether nonprofit or for profit\n(e.g., employment, occupational health and safety [OH&S], and equal\nemployment opportunity legislation), or may be specific to nonprofit\norganizations (e.g., taxation exemptions);\nfacilitate  the  setting  up  of  nonprofit  organizations  by  providing\nencouragement or infrastructure;\ninfluence organizations through regulation (e.g., regulation of nursing\nhomes) or assist in the development of service standards;\ninfluence  an  organization\u2019s  service  delivery  framework  through\nguidelines for funding and service delivery models; or, though less\nfrequently,\nauthorize an organization to act on its behalf (e.g., in Australia the\nRoyal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals [RSPCA] can\nconduct inspections and initiate prosecutions in cases of cruelty to\nanimals).\n\nNot surprisingly, the nature of the relationship between government and\nnonprofit  organizations  changes  over  time. The  change  can  result  from\ndeliberate policy decisions or from the way policy decisions are carried out\n(e.g., introduction of different funding mechanisms, competitive tendering,\nor increased monitoring), but the complexity of the relationship also means\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n140\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fContracts or Partnerships in the Delivery of Community Services\n\n141\n\nthat the change may be an unanticipated consequence of other changes (Craig\nand Manthorpe 1999). The dimensions of change include the closeness of the\nrelationship, the degree of formality, the level of risk taken by each party, the\ndegree  of  resource  sharing,  and  the  extent  of  dependency.  Changes  in  the\nrelationship between government and nonprofit organizations have had, and\nwill continue to have, a wide range of impact on nonprofit organizations as\nwell as on government representatives (Edwards 2001).\n\nThis paper draws on a recent study of CSOs in South Australia that\nexplored their changing relationship with government through a period of\npublic sector reform (Baulderstone 2005). The study involved interviews with\nmanagers of CSOs and public sector organizations in 2000\u20132001, following\na period of public sector reform, and again in 2004, after the introduction of\nthe language of partnership.\n\nPublic Sector Reform\n\nReforms  in  the  public  sector  have  been  widespread  in  Western\ndemocracies, and Western notions of public sector reform have increasingly\nbeen applied to developing countries (Minogue 2001). Such reforms have\nbeen driven by various factors (Aucoin 1995, Aucoin and Heintzman 2000,\nLipsky and Smith 1990, Peters 2001, Sullivan and Skelcher 2002):\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\neconomic factors, including a perception of increasing costs in the\npublic sector;\nthe influence of ideological concerns, including public choice theory\nand agency theory;\nthe  proliferation  of  interest  groups,  which  are  more  assertive  and\norganized as mechanisms of public participation;\nincreased media scrutiny of the public sector;\na  belief  that  government  agencies  were  unable  to  deliver  policy\noutcomes; and\ndemands by parliamentarians for a greater role in governance.\n\nPublic sector reforms required the adoption of management techniques\nthat  were  more  like  those  of  the  private  sector  (Broadbent,  Dietrich,  and\nLaughlin 1996), and a shift in emphasis toward a market-based institutional\nframework and the adoption of contract or contract-like relationships. The\nvirtues of operating under contract are said to include making responsibilities\nexplicit and creating appropriate incentives (Walsh 1995). Many of the public\nsector reforms (including the adoption of an accrual accounting framework,\nan  emphasis  on  results,  and  performance  reporting  on  outcomes)  directly\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n141\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f142\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\naffected the management of accountability, changing the focus from inputs\nand processes to outputs and outcomes (Argy 2001). Other reforms promoted\nthe empowerment of clients as well as both lower-level employees and managers\nin  the  public  service  (Peters  and  Pierre  2000).  Shergold  (1997),  as\nCommonwealth Public Service Commissioner, described the changes in the\nAustralian  public  sector  as  having  moved  it  overall  from  a  culture  of\nadministration,  emphasizing  process,  to  one  of  management,  emphasizing\nperformance and achievement of outcomes.\n\nIn Australia there has been limited contracting out of services previously\nfunded by government (Lyons 1997), with competitive tendering generally\nbeing used to award contracts for new services rather than existing ones. The\nchanges in existing program areas or services have instead primarily involved\nadopting a different set of funding arrangements (e.g., in 2000), including\nmany elements of formal contracts even if they continued to be identified as\nservice agreements. Whether provided through competitive contracts, ongoing\ncontracts, or grant funding, funding from government, for most nonprofit\norganizations, leads to mutual dependence (Nevile 2000).\n\nLyons (1995) identified five models of the funding relationship between\ngovernment and community organizations, and noted a progression toward\ncompetitive  tendering  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  quasi-voucher  systems. The\ninfluence of the different funding models on the location and type of service\nis shown in the table.\n\nBoth  the  government-as-philanthropist  and  submission  models  can  be\nseen as forms of grant funding.

The competitive tendering and\nquasi-voucher  models,  on  the  other  hand,  involve  the  purchase  of  a  clearly\nspecified service (output) for identified users. In theory, both the competitive\ntendering and quasi-voucher models require the capacity to clearly define and\ncost outputs. Historically, they have been alternative, rather than sequential,\ndevelopments from the planning model; however, the adoption of a quasi-voucher\nmodel has been limited to particular program areas in the community services\nsector in Australia, most notably the Home and Community Care program.\n\nIn practice, public sector reform left many CSOs subject to a mixture of\nfunding  models  (Australian  Council  of  Social  Services  1997,  Lyons  1997)\nwith differing requirements as a result of different approaches between the\nCommonwealth, state, and territory governments, and, in some cases, between\nprogram areas within a level of government.\n\nVarious practical difficulties with the specifications of contracts (or service\nagreements post-reform) between government and the private and nonprofit\nsectors have been identified in principle (Austin 2003, Considine 1996) and\nin practice (Auditor General of Western Australia 2000, Barrett 1997, De\nHoog 1984, Hardy and Wistow 1998, Heinrich 1999, Najam 2000, Public\nAccounts and Estimates Committee [Victoria] 2002, Smith and Lipsky 1993,\nSmyth 1997, Taylor 2000):\n\n(cid:127) Contracts often failed to identify the key attributes of the service\u2014to\nadequately define the specifications of the service or output being\npurchased.\n\n(cid:127) There was a loss of public sector knowledge and expertise, such that\npublic  servants  could  not  clearly  specify  requirements,  identify\nperformance indicators, or assess risks.\n\n(cid:127) The  public  sector  lacked  expertise  in  contract  management  and\ncomplex negotiation, in some cases as a result of the high turnover of\nstaff in these positions.\n\n(cid:127) There  was  a  risk  of  corruption  or  capture  in  contract  letting  and\n\n(cid:127) The transaction and compliance costs of service providers were high.\n(cid:127) Roles  and  responsibilities  were  not  sufficiently  defined  for  the\n\nmanagement.\n\ncontracting parties.\n\n(cid:127) The performance information requested and provided was inadequate\n\nfor determining whether outcomes were being achieved.\n\n(cid:127) Contracts included penalties for poor performance but not rewards\n\nfor good performance.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n143\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f144\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\n(cid:127) The shortness of the contract periods reduced the capacity of nonprofit\norganizations  to  achieve  efficiency  gains,  and  threatened  service\ncontinuity.\nProgress payments on contracts were not linked to program milestones.\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127) The financial risks to the government were not rigorously assessed\n\nand managed.\n\n(cid:127) Government agencies lacked awareness of the total costs and impact\nof  contracting  on  the  delivery  of  community  services.  Hardy  and\nWistow\u2019s study (1998), for example, found that the focus on price\npenalized providers who invested in staff training and quality assurance\nsystems, and paid reasonable wages.\n\n(cid:127) Delays in contract preparation by government resulted in contracted\n\nagencies delivering services without a contract in place.\n\n(cid:127) The  results  of  tendering  decisions,  as  well  as  feedback,  were\ncommunicated late to nonprofit organizations and so could not help\nthem be more successful in the future.\n\n(cid:127) Human  services  contracts  were  difficult  to  monitor,  both  because\ngovernment agencies lacked monitoring resources and expertise, and\nbecause  outcome  measures  and  monitoring  tools  were  difficult  to\ndevelop.\n\n(cid:127) The  planning  and  purchasing  areas  of  the  funding  department\n\nsometimes communicated poorly with each other.\n\nWidespread funding by government has limited the transfer of roles from\nthe public to the nonprofit sector in the area of community services, but the\nadoption of contracts and contract-like funding agreements has also clearly\nbeen problematic. Poor planning and a lack of skills and knowledge needed to\nimplement changes were commonly noted. Early planning and consultation\nmay have predicted difficulties such as price-quality tensions and the need for\nclear  communication  channels.  It  is  not  clear  whether  there  was  a  lack  of\nawareness  of  the  new  skills  that  would  be  needed  to  manage  contracted\nperformance and procurement, or whether pressure to demonstrate that change\nwas  being  achieved  led  to  premature  action.  The  increased  monitoring\nrequirements undertaken by public servants have had to be accommodated\nwithin  a  shrinking  public  sector  required  to  demonstrate  efficiency  gains\nthrough reduced staff numbers while increasing effectiveness. The concurrent\norganizational changes and requirement to adopt new roles have contributed\nto gaps between the rhetoric of reform and the actual change achieved, besides\nhighlighting gaps in public sector skills.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n144\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fContracts or Partnerships in the Delivery of Community Services\n\n145\n\nImpact on CSOs\n\nThe relationship between government and CSOs has changed during\nthe period of public sector reform. Some of these changes were deliberately\ndirected by government while others were more indirect consequences. While\nsome of the impact has been widespread, the experiences of CSO interviewees\nsuggest that other changes were mediated by individual relationships with\npublic sector staff.\n\nThis  study  found  that,  rather  than  significant  changes  in  service\nautonomy, there appears to have been a subtle change of focus in service delivery\nthat is more evident in those CSOs where government funding is the primary\nsource of income. Where this change has occurred, it is likely to have led to a\nnarrowing in the scope of services delivered, at the risk of inappropriate \u201cone\nsize fits all\u201d provision. This was seen as more evident in output-funded services.\nOther effects include:\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127) CSOs\u2019 trust in their public sector counterparts has been damaged,\nalthough this is not universally true. Trust was more likely to have\nbeen damaged in the early period of the introduction of contractual\nlanguage, partly because of the polarized interpretations of some public\nsector staff and CSO fears about the consequences. However, some\nCSO managers retained positive relationships with individual public\nsector  managers,  which  mediated  their  perception  of  the  broader\nrelationship. The monitoring of contracts in some program areas was\nseen  as  punitive,  but  again  the  approach  varied  between  public\nservants, even within the same program.\nFor CSOs, the most significant impact has been on resources\u2014the\ncost of staff time spent preparing tenders and meeting additional\nreporting  requirements,  and  the  cost  of  additional  information\ntechnology for reporting. These costs have been heightened by the\nspecific  reporting  requirements  for  different  funding  programs,\nnecessitating  the  repackaging  of  similar  information,  and  by  the\nlack of congruence between the extent of monitoring and reporting\nthe  funding  agencies  expect  and  the  level  of  funding  the  CSOs\nreceive. Further cost increases have resulted from broader government\nchanges, including changes in OH&S legislation and the introduction\nof a goods and services tax, which have made compliance more costly\nfor organizations in all sectors, but particularly for small organizations.\nMoreover, because administrative and infrastructure costs were often\nnot recognized in contracts and there was a lack of evidence to enable\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n145\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f146\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nthe establishment of unit costs for the services, some CSO tenders\nunderestimated the cost of delivery of a particular service.\n\n(cid:127) The impact on service quality appears mixed, with some CSO managers\nidentifying  positive  outcomes  from  the  increased  emphasis  on\nmeasurement while others believe that their internal accountability\nprocesses  had  already  been  working  satisfactorily.  Where  negative\neffects were identified, these tended to be associated with the diversion\nof funds to accountability requirements rather than service delivery.\nThere was evidence of an increased emphasis on the management\nand  monitoring  of  volunteer  workers,  although  influences  toward\nincreased  professionalism  of  staff  and  greater  awareness  of  the\napplicability of employment regulation are likely to be as important\nas  any  changes  in  the  relationship  with  government  funders. This\nsuggests a degree of pressure for consistency and for alignment with\ngovernment policy particularly at the managerial level, where there is\ngreater  awareness  of  the  contract  requirements. Tension  can  arise\nbetween management and frontline staff, who are often more focused\non responding to the needs of the individuals with whom they are in\nconstant contact.\n\n(cid:127) There have been structural changes in the CSO sector, with some\norganizations creating more formalized networks and partnerships,\nincluding  instances  of  small  organizations  seeking  support  or\nadministrative assistance from larger ones. While such decisions have\nbeen influenced by several factors, an acknowledged driver of change\nin  some  instances  was  an  increased  capacity  to  win  competitive\ntenders.\n\n(cid:127) The sector appears to be more aware of accountability issues, and the\nnature of accountability to government funders itself appears to have\nchanged. CSO managers in this study felt that government funders\nwere  not  clear  about  how  that  accountability  should  be  managed.\nSome  CSO  managers  were  responding  proactively  by  developing\nstronger  internal  systems  and  starting  quality  accreditation.  Such\ninitiatives were motivated by a desire not only to strengthen internal\naccountability but also, in some cases, to position the organization\nfavorably in the eyes of funders and donors.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n146\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fContracts or Partnerships in the Delivery of Community Services\n\n147\n\nPartnership and Collaboration\n\nA paradigm shift is occurring in the way in which the government, business\nand community sectors relate to each other, challenging each to redefine\ntheir respective roles and responsibilities. (Edwards 2001)\n\nA  new  discourse  that  includes  partnership,  integration,  joined-up\ngovernment, and governance has been adopted by governments in Australia\nat the federal, state, and local levels. The language of integrated service delivery\nand joined-up government has been introduced into debates about the roles\nof both government and the nonprofit sector. Collaboration and partnership\nare increasingly identified as both a policy goal (e.g., Australian Council of\nSocial Services 1999) and an implementation methodology for the delivery of\nhuman services in Australia (Institute of Public Administration Australia 2002;\nPenter, Bindi, Thompson, and Gatley 2002) and elsewhere (Lewis 2001, Miller\nand Ahman 2000). Cooperative or integrated service delivery is seen as the\nbest  approach  to  serving  user  needs,  given  their  increased  complexity\n(Department of Human Services 1999).\n\nIn the literature, collaboration, partnership, and integration are discussed\nat both the policy-making level and the practice or service provision level.\nThey can involve:\n\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\nthe service user as a partner (Bruner, Kunesh, and Knuth 1992);\nprograms  within  an  agency  (Cross, Yan,  and  Louis  2000;  Gowdy,\nRapp, and Poertner 1993);\norganizations within a system, e.g., health (Graham and Barter 1999,\nGray  1985,  Lister  2000,  Osborne  and  Murray  2000,  Penter  et  al.\n2002, Wilkinson 1997);\nsectors\u2014public,  private,  nongovernment  (Ginsler  1998,  Grubbs\n2000, Huxham and Vangen 2000, Institute of Public Administration\nAustralia 2002, Lindenberg 2001);\nsystems, e.g., health, education, welfare (Ad Hoc Working Group on\nIntegrated Services 1996; Bruner, Kunesh, and Knuth 1992; Hooper-\nBriar and Lawson 1994; State Services Commission 1999); and\nlevels of government (Ad Hoc Working Group on Integrated Services\n1996, Institute of Public Administration Australia 2002).\n\nHowever, the rationale underpinning all such approaches is the existence\nof  complex  problems  whose  resolution  is  beyond  the  capacity  of  a  single\norganization, program, or sector (e.g., Huxham and Vangen 2000).

Perhaps the earliest and most well-known of these\nis the Compact on Relations between the Government and the Voluntary and\nCommunity Sector. This is a set of principles and undertakings that provides\na  framework  for  relations  between  government  and  the  sector  in  England\n(Home Office 1998). The development of local compacts has been encouraged\nand  at  a  national  level  there  is  an  annual  review  of  progress  against  work\nplans. Good practice guidelines on funding and consultation that attempt to\nshape the relationship between funder departments and service delivery agencies\nhave been developed for government agencies. Compacts have subsequently\nbeen signed with the nonprofit sector in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n148\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fContracts or Partnerships in the Delivery of Community Services\n\n149\n\nIn response, the Government of New Zealand set up a working party in\n2000  to  look  at  the  relationship  between  government  and  community\norganizations. This group reported on resource development, capacity building\nfor  the  sector,  taxation  and  charitable  status,  and  relationships  with  local\ngovernment and the business sector, and made recommendations and identified\nresearch  questions  in  each  of  these  areas  (Community  Policy Team  2001,\nHanley  2000).  It  concluded  that  there  was  not  enough  coherence  in  the\ncommunity  sector  to  support  a  formal  agreement  with  government,  but\nrecommended that government make a formal statement of intent, setting\nout principles and values and a number of relationship-building activities.\nThe steering group set up to implement the recommendations reported on\nprogress in 2002. A Web site providing advice for government funders was set\nup  and  a  number  of  pilot  projects  were  conducted. These  included  the\ndevelopment  of  standard  documentation,  reduction  in  duplication  of\nmonitoring by different agencies, and a lead-funder approach to purchasing\n(Bailey and Wilde 2001).\n\nIn  Canada  the  Government  formed  a  task  force  to  hold  a  series  of\n\u201cjoint tables,\u201d one of whose objectives was to work toward an \u201caccord\u201d (Brock\n2000, Voluntary Sector Taskforce 2000). Strategies identified by the task\nforce  for  coordinating  participation  within  government  and  the  sector\nincluded capacity-building measures such as data collection, research, and\ninformation-sharing  initiatives  and  skills  development  for  the  sector.  An\nAccord between the Government of Canada and the Voluntary Sector (VSI\n2004) was released in 2001. It is based on five guiding principles that include\nthe  independence  of  government  and  the  voluntary  sector,  the\ninterdependence of some of their goals, and the need for commitment to\ndialogue, cooperation, and collaboration. Codes of good practice have been\ndeveloped for policy dialogue and funding. The initiative is overseen by a\njoint steering committee of government and voluntary sector representatives,\nwhich  reports  annually.  Government  departments  have  been  required  to\nappoint a champion to promote and lead the use of the accord and codes\nwithin their organizations.\n\nIn South Australia, there have been significant indicators of a changing\nrelationship  between  government  and  CSOs. These  have  included  several\ninstances of the development of formalized agreements or commitments to\ncooperative working arrangements between government and nongovernment\norganizations.\n\nA \u201ccompact\u201d between the south Australian government and the volunteer\nsector was signed in 2003 following its development by a working party of\ngovernment and nonprofit representatives (Office for Volunteers 2003).

The  compact\nwas developed through consultation with a wide range of community group\nrepresentatives and volunteers, and had the stated aim of:\n\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n\nadvancing volunteering;\nredressing issues that impede volunteering;\nestablishing communication protocols; and\ndeveloping appropriate policies and procedures.\n\nA volunteer ministerial advisory group was set up to monitor progress\ntoward these aims. It reported back to the Minister in May 2004 (Volunteer\nMinisterial  Advisory  Group  2004)  and  identified  the  initiation  of  a  local\ncompact  in  one  local  government  region,  and  plans  for  a  state  volunteer\ncongress. This initiative appears to adopt aspects of the British Compact model\nin requiring progress reports; however, it does not provide an individual arbiter\nof disputes, so it relies on goodwill and ongoing commitment from government.\nDiscussions  between  the  South  Australian  Council  of  Social  Services\n(SACOSS) and the government led to the production of Common Ground,\na partnership agreement between the state government and the community\nservices  sector,  which  was  developed  by  the  Human  Services  Peak  Bodies\nWorking  Group. This  group  included  senior  executives  from  the  funding\ndepartments and representatives of peak bodies in the health and community\nservices sectors, and is jointly chaired by the CEOs of the two relevant funding\ndepartments and SACOSS. The agreement identified a set of shared principles\nthat  include  valuing  transparency  and  accountability  and  maximizing\nopportunities for collaboration and participation. It provided for an ongoing\nmonitoring role for the partnership through a human services peaks forum. It\nbuilt on the work of the Working Together (1999) group, but extended the\nscope  beyond  the  earlier  emphasis  on  contracts  and  tendering  to  include\nplanning and procurement principles.\n\nParallel to the development of the agreement, the Community Services\nFunding  and  Planning  Working  Group  (CSFPWG)  was  established. This\nconsisted of SACOSS and public sector staff. It intended to explore simpler\nand \u201cbetter\u201d alternatives to the current funding arrangements, and to establish\nprinciples and guidelines for the \u2018participation of the community sector in the\nplanning of programs and priorities for service development (CSFPWG 2004).\nA  standard  form  of  service  agreement  had  been  developed  in  2001  and\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n150\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fContracts or Partnerships in the Delivery of Community Services\n\n151\n\nimplemented across four program areas as program funding expired, with the\nintention of extending this further through the department. This had required\nnegotiation with individual program areas; consequently, implementation was\nsomewhat piecemeal. The CSFPWG facilitated further consultation within\nthe sector and reached consensus on a standard form of agreement to be used\nin the majority of programs within the two funding departments, the exception\nbeing in program areas identified as high risk, such as alternative care services.\nCSFPWG  proposed  a  planning  and  funding  framework,  which\ncomprised a mixed model of provision that would allow for options of direct\nallocation,  invited  submissions,  advertised  submissions,  and  competitive\ntendering  based  on  principles  of  partnership,  best-value  outcomes,  and\nfinancial responsibility. This would mean a significant reduction in the time\nbetween the decision to allocate funds to a new initiative and the signing of\na service agreement with a CSO (estimated as a minimum of 2 months), as\nwell as a reduction in the work CSOs put into writing tenders. The framework\nwould also allow for \u201cprequalified provider\u201d arrangements that would, it is\nclaimed, enable a rigorous and accountable initial selection process to be\ncombined with a capacity for responsiveness to new funding opportunities,\nand could provide more opportunities for smaller agencies to participate in\ntendering.\n\nThe group proposed a planning model that required each departmental\nfunding branch to prepare triennial funding plans, which would provide an\noverview of:\n\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n\ngovernment and department policies;\nenvironmental context;\ndivision or branch strategies;\nbudget context;\nfunding context; and\nservice agreement information.\n\nThe  group  proposed  annual  updates  to  incorporate  new  funding\ninitiatives  and  any  changes  in  the  contextual  aspects  of  the  plan.  The\ncommunity sector, peak bodies, and consumer organizations were expected\nto be consulted before the development of the plan, and involved in reviews\nand evaluations of the plan. The group proposed that a program funding plan\npanel be established as a governance body for the framework with the role of\nreviewing and assessing the adequacy of program funding plans and updates.\nThe responsibility of the working group was extended to the implementation\nof the framework in late 2004.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n151\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f152\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nFurther recognition of the role of nonprofit organizations was evidenced\nby the appointment of a community board to oversee a new state government\ninitiative to develop social inclusion. This emphasized interagency cooperation\nbetween  government  departments,  and  between  departments  and  the\nnongovernment  organizations. The  Premier  appointed  Monsignor  David\nCappo, former chairman of Centacare Australia, the national peak body of\nthe Catholic social welfare agencies, to both the Social Inclusion Board and\nthe Economic Development Board, both of which provide advice directly to\ngovernment ministers.\n\nThe visible indicators of a changing relationship between government\nand  CSOs\u2014of  formalized  agreements  or  commitments  to  cooperative\nworking  arrangements  between  government  and  nongovernment\norganizations\u2014were reflected in the views of the majority of the interviewees\nin  the  second  round  of  interviews.  Changes  were  identified  both  in  the\nprocesses being used by government funders to introduce change and in the\nproducts of those changes.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  changes  in  the  area  of  tendering  and  contractual\nrelationships,  changes  were  identified  in  the  areas  of  policy  engagement,\nengagement  in  service  support  and  development,  and  in  the  general\nrelationship. This was recognized by public sector and CSO interviewees alike\nand  seen  as  a  positive  change.  As  one  interviewee  said:  \u201cThere  [are]  still\nfrustrations but that whole antipathy has gone out of the relationship with\nthe state government.\u201d\n\nIt was suggested that the public sector realized that the community sector,\nthe community itself, and the public sector all had valuable knowledge, but\nrecognized the power differentials and constraints on the public sector. While\nthe approach was within a framework of joint problem solving, it acknowledged\nthe different role and accountability of the public sector.\n\nAt a practical level, staff in public sector funding agencies were attempting\nto improve relationships through regular, informal meetings with different\ngroupings of participants, including peak bodies and regional groups of agencies\nreceiving particular program funding. Staff viewed these as a valuable way of\nsharing information and identifying emerging issues.\n\nSeveral  CSO  interviewees  commented  on  an  increase  in  CSO\nrepresentation on various committees, leading to a feeling of greater respect\nfor the sector. This contrasted with the previously implied message that the\nsector\u2019s views did not count.\n\nMuch of the disquiet over the move to contractual arrangements raised\nin the earlier interviews appeared to have dissipated. This was partly because\nsome of the earlier problems had been addressed through the move away from\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n152\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fContracts or Partnerships in the Delivery of Community Services\n\n153\n\nthe  rigid  separation  of  purchaser  and  provider,  and  improvements  in\ncontracting practices.\n\nAs in other partnerships, individual relationships between public servants\nand CSO staff were seen to be as important as the structural arrangements in\nworking  together  effectively.  It  was  evident  from  the  interviews  and\ndocumentation examined that there were clear gestures toward partnership\nby senior managers in the public sector. However, such gestures did not always\ntranslate into a changed relationship with project officers at an organizational\nlevel. This may reflect the reluctance of some individuals to move out of their\noffices and become involved with funded agencies, but it must be recognized\nthat a move to a partnership relationship removes the clarity of the boundaries\nof responsibility and accountability. In a formal and distant purchaser-provider\nrelationship, the role of the public sector project officer is more constrained,\nand responsibility and accountability are more easily directed upward through\nthe  traditional  hierarchical  system.  Adopting  the  language  of  partnership,\nengaging the sector in joint planning, and returning to service development\nactivities blurs this clarity. There appears to have been no attempt to redraw\nthese boundaries in a systematic way at the level of program area project officers.\nSome welcomed the opportunity to undertake a more service development\u2013\noriented and support role, particularly with smaller organizations. However,\nthe lack of clarity allowed those with no confidence or skills to work closely\nwith the sector to maintain their distance.\n\nSustaining Partnership\n\nThe transition from submission to contracting models of funding can\nbe represented as a move from a paradigm of \u201cfund us to do good things\u201d to\none  of  \u201cpay  us  to  produce  these  outputs.\u201d  Changing  to  a  partnership\nrelationship introduces a paradigm of \u201clet\u2019s work together to achieve these\noutcomes.\u201d This is a more difficult relationship to manage, particularly in the\ncontext of external scrutiny of public sector funding. If a partnership model is\nto be meaningful there would need to be ongoing dialogue between the players\nthrough the planning and evaluation stages. This can occur within a range of\nfunding mechanisms but means shared accountability for planning and for\nthe improvement of service delivery models.\n\nSustaining a partnership between government and CSOs requires both\nstructural and relational changes. Formal agreements signify positive intent,\nbut without a framework of reporting and monitoring are of little value and\nrisk becoming meaningless symbols through lack of systematic implementation.\nAction needs to be taken to increase the awareness of such mechanisms both\nwithin government and the public sector and among CSOs.

It does, however, indicate\nthe use of a relational framework for contracting rather than a transactional\none (Kettner and Martin 1990). Such a framework assumes a high level of\ntrust between players. Trust is built over time and easily lost; however, the\nformal  moves  toward  collaboration  and  partnership  provide  an  important\nstarting point.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n154\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fContracts or Partnerships in the Delivery of Community Services\n\n155\n\nReferences\n\nAd Hoc Working Group on Integrated Services. 1996.

Anand1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis paper examines the impact of the targeted public distribution system\n(TPDS) in the State of Kerala in India. The paper examines the strengths and\nweaknesses of TPDS and how the strategy has failed to achieve the objectives\nenvisaged, thereby widening the disparities between rich and poor, and creating\nsocial disharmony. The targeting has led to a division of the society into those\nbelow the poverty line (BPL) and those above the poverty line (APL) with the\nintroduction of dual ration cards. The experience underscores the fact that\neven the best-intentioned public administration strategies, when carried out\nthe wrong way, can pave the way to greater inequality and thus more poverty.\n\nConcept of Targeting\n\nThe targeting of welfare programs is the subject of worldwide interest, and\nthere is ongoing debate for and against targeting among economists and advisers.\nThe term \u201ctargeting\u201d refers to identifying eligible or (needy) individuals and\nscreening  out  the  ineligible,  according  to  defined  eligibility  criteria,  for  the\npurpose of transferring resources (Devereux 1999). The basic reasons for targeting\nin all welfare programs fall under three general headings (Gebrehiwot 2001):\n\n(cid:127) Humanitarian reasons\u2014so that the really needy are assisted and the\n\nless needy do not benefit unfairly;\n\n(cid:127) Resource and efficiency reasons\u2014so that scarce resources are used in\nsuch a way that they have the greatest impact on the problem to be\naddressed; and\n\n(cid:127) Development reasons\u2014so that dependency and economic disincentive\neffects  (at  all  levels,  from  households  to  the  national  level)  are\nminimized.\n\nFor  those  whose  primary  concern  is  equity,  targeting  can  channel\nmaximum benefits to the most vulnerable groups, while for those concerned\n\n1 Associate Professor, Institute of Management in Government, Kerala, India.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n161\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f162\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nwith  saving  money  (governments,  funding  agencies),  it  is  likely  to  be  a\nconsiderably cheaper option than blanket distribution or general food subsidies.\nThe World Bank and the International Food Policy Research Institute\nhave come out strongly in favor of targeted intervention to promote food\nsecurity and mitigate the social costs of economic adjustment for the poor.\n\nTargeting the Public Distribution System in India\n\nThe public distribution system (PDS) in India is the key element of the\ncountry\u2019s food security system, particularly for the poor. It is an instrument\nfor ensuring the availability, at affordable prices, of certain essential food grains\n(mainly rice and wheat), as well as sugar and kerosene. Households are given\na ration card that entitles them to buy fixed rations of these commodities The\nGovernment, through the Food Corporation of India (FCI), procures and\nstocks food grains, which are released every month for distribution through\nthe PDS network across the country. The responsibility for implementing,\nmonitoring, and enforcing this legal provision rests with the state governments.\nEarlier, the PDS was a general entitlement scheme for all consumers,\nwith no targeting. But in 1997 the Government of India introduced targeted\nPDS. TPDS has divided the population into BPL and APL categories on the\nbasis of the poverty line defined by the Planning Commission. Food grains\nare now allotted at two sets of prices\u2014a highly subsidized price for the poor,\nand a near-open-market price for the rest. Targeting, it was hoped, could play\na more meaningful role by translating the macro-level self-sufficiency in food\ngrains achieved by the country into the micro level by ensuring the availability\nof food to poor households (Ministry of Food and Civil Supplies 1997).\n\n Two more PDS schemes were introduced later. The Antyodaya Anna\nYogana Scheme (AAY), launched in 2000, provides rice and wheat at very\nnominal  prices  to  the  poorest  of  the  poor,  while  the  Annapoorna  Scheme\nintroduced in 2001 provides free rice monthly to those above the age of 65\nyears who are not receiving any pension.\n\nGeneral Situation in Kerala\n\nKerala is a relatively small state (area 38,000 square kilometers, population\n30 million), in the southwest corner of India. Its development experience has\nbeen  what  the  Human  Development  Report  (1996)  of  the  United  Nations\nDevelopment Programme would call \u201ca course of lopsided development,\u201d with\nits remarkable human development achievements well comparable with those\nof developed countries and hard-to-match economic growth. On the other\nhand,  food  security  in  Kerala  presents  a  totally  different  picture.  Kerala  is\nknown as a \u201cfood deficit\u201d state in India because of the wide gap between the\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n162\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fTargeted Public Distribution System: Lessons from a Food-Deficit State In India\n\n163\n\nconsumption and the production of food grains, especially rice, the staple\ndiet of the population. The area and production of rice since the mid-1970s\nhave been in steep decline owing to several factors like the sharp rise in wages\nand the price of fertilizers, scarcity of labor, and farmers\u2019 preference for more\nremunerative cash crops. Between 1970\u20131971 and 1999, the area planted to\nrice shrank from 875,000 hectares to 350,000 hectares. Kannan (2000), in\nhis working paper \u201cFood Security in a Regional Perspective: A View from\nFood-Deficit Kerala,\u201d mentions the extent of this deficit, which has increased\nover time. Kerala\u2019s deficit in rice was 55% in the mid-1970s but by 2000 it\nhad increased to more than 75%. At present, barely 10% of the food grain\nrequirement is met from the state (Government of Kerala Economic Review\n2004). This  alarming  situation,  coupled  with  unemployment,  can  greatly\nheighten the state\u2019s vulnerability in the matter of food security.\n\nThe expert committee (Government of Kerala 1999) that examined this\nissue concluded that Kerala could not become self-sufficient in food and hence\nemphasized the need to achieve food security instead. Food security in this\ncontext assumes great significance, as it refers to the ability to ensure access to\nfood  for  the  population.  The  PDS  in  Kerala  is  a  means  by  which  the\ngovernment can provide food security.\n\nKerala is known to have one of the best-run and most effective PDS\nwith near-universal coverage. According to the High Level Committee Report\n(Government of India 2003), in the mid-1990s, around 95% of households\nin Kerala were covered by the PDS and the monthly entitlement of grains\nsatisfied  the  minimum  cereal  requirements  recommended  by  the  Indian\nCouncil of Medical Research. The purchase of rationed articles through the\nPDS was also quite high, compared with that in most other states.\n\nHowever,  a  shift  in  the  government  policy  and  the  targeting  of  PDS\nsubsidy to BPL families since 1996\u20131997 has opened a Pandora\u2019s box. The\nserious implications, including flaws in targeting and the division of the entire\ncommunity into APL and BPL classes, have made the system ineffective and\nprompted a general call for a revamp of the PDS.\n\nObjectives and Methodology\nThis study sought to examine\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\nthe extent to which consumers, particularly the vulnerable, depend\non the PDS for food grains; and\nthe effectiveness of targeting, and flaws in TPDS like the exclusion of\nthe eligible poor.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n163\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f164\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nThe  study  was  empirical  and  used  both  primary  and  secondary  data\nextensively. It began with an exploratory study. Secondary data were reviewed,\nand  focus  group  discussions  were  held  with  officials  of  implementing\ndepartments, namely, FCI and the Department of Food and Civil Supplies,\nand  with  private  traders  and  program  beneficiaries  (those  included  in  the\nBPL and APL lists). A total of 150 households were purposively selected and\nstudied.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nThe findings of the study showed that TPDS has unilaterally increased\nthe price of food grains and other essential commodities for the poor as well\nas  the  non-poor. Those  who  depend  solely  on  the  system  have  been  most\nseriously affected. As a result, most of the people have opted to purchase in\nthe open market. The major issues have been studied and are presented in\ndetail below.\n\nDecline in Offtake and Allotments\n\nThe offtake of rationed articles has come down considerably since the\nintroduction of targeting. Even the official statistics show that the offtake of\nrice among those in the APL category is almost nil. A cursory observation in\nthe field reveals that the consumers in the higher-income brackets do not buy\ntheir allotted quota, while the lower-income groups face many problems related\nto  inadequate  quantity  and  poor  quality  of  food  grains,  inadequate  and\nuntimely allotment, etc., often caused deliberately by intermediaries.\n\nThe decline in offtake among the APL can be attributed to the higher\nprice and the low quality of grains distributed through PDS compared with\nthe grains available in the open market. Higher wages and greater purchasing\npower (fueled by remittances from family members working abroad) than in\nother states allow buyers in Kerala to go after better-quality products. Private\ndealers disparaging the quality of the grains (which has, in fact, improved)\nand complaining of their reduced margins, poor and unhygienic conditions\nin ration shops, poor quality of service, private shops sharing the same roof as\nthe ration shops (often with a common owner), and the general perception\namong the higher-income groups that PDS is for the poor\u2014all these factors\nhave contributed to the move to the open market. The public balks at having\nto pay different prices for the same quality of rice.\n\nOn the other hand, in AAY and the Annapoorna Scheme and among\nthe BPL, a detailed analysis revealed a 100% offtake. It was observed, however,\nthat the BPL cardholders do not receive their entire allotment at the reduced\nprice, although the stock registers showed that the allotments were fully taken\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n164\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fTargeted Public Distribution System: Lessons from a Food-Deficit State In India\n\n165\n\nup by the shop owners. In many cases, the food grains were siphoned off to\nother  consumers  or  traders  at  higher  rates.  Even  as  dealers  complain  of\ninadequate allotments, FCI contends that an average buffer stock for 80 days,\nat 35 kilograms (kg) per card, is maintained and there are no partial allotments.\nThese contradictory statements show serious lapses in the distribution system.\nA central government survey identified 25% of the population as BPL,\naccording to the official poverty line defined by the Planning Commission in\n1993\u20131994. The Kerala government\u2019s estimate (based on a survey) is 42%.\nUntil 2001, the subsidy for the additional 17% came from the state treasury.\nSince  the  subsidy  was  discontinued,  the  42%  BPL  population  has  had  to\ncontent itself with the 25% central government allotment. In effect, the eligible\nand deserving poor are at least partially denied access to their entitlement.\n\nTargeting and BPL Identification\n\nThe main flaw in the system is that non-eligibles are in the approved list\nof BPL families (targeted beneficiaries) whereas eligible beneficiaries have been\nleft out. The criteria for inclusion in the BPL list are solely economic, and\nthese are often willfully understated to secure inclusion. Some complain that\npersons with political patronage have found a place in the BPL list. In contrast,\na large number of the very poor are in the APL category and are thus denied\naccess to the subsidized food grains from PDS.\n\nThe BPL list, which was prepared in 1997, has not been periodically\nupdated to weed out those who are no longer below the poverty line. The\nCivil Supplies Department and the Poverty Eradication Mission conducted a\nsurvey in 2001 to update the list, but the revised list has not yet been officially\naccepted, much less released. While family income is the sole criterion used\nby the Planning Committee in identifying and targeting the poor, noneconomic\ncriteria  evolved  by  Kudumbasree  (the  Poverty  Eradication  Mission  of  the\ngovernment) can also be used. Women\u2019s groups may be called upon to help\nwith the annual updating. Unless the process of identifying the poor is made\ntransparent and foolproof, the TDPS will not serve its real purpose.\n\nThe introduction of the Antyodaya Scheme in 2002 (further culling out\nthe  poorest  of  the  poor  from  the  BPL  list)  amounted  to  further  targeting\nwithin the existing list, thereby adding chaos and confusion. As Swaminathan\n(2003) rightly pointed out, \u201ctargeting can widen social divisions: segregating\nhouseholds on the basis of income can lead to division among the poor, social\ntensions and polarization. Such division can exacerbate existing forms of caste\nand gender oppression.\u201d\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n165\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f166\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nEntitlement to Food Grains\n\nUnder the earlier policy, ration scales were in fixed quantities per person\nor unit. Now, irrespective of size and need, each household (even if it is a joint\nfamily) is entitled to 35 kg per month This has opened avenues for malpractices\nand corruption. During the field visit it was observed that the 35 kg exceeded\nthe requirements of small BPL households, but was often insufficient in tribal\nareas, pockets along the coast, and other areas. The earlier system of fixing the\nquota on the basis of family size was more realistic. This problem assumes\ngreater  significance  in  Kerala,  where  the  central  government  allotment  for\n25% of the population must be shared by 42% of the population.\n\nQuality Issue\n\nThere is a general feeling that the quality is better than it was before\n1997. An examination of food samples during a visit to godowns showed\nthe food to be quite superior, but in some cases the grain in retail shops was\nnot of the same quality. The local people who were interviewed were also of\nthe view that the food grains released from the FCI godown often do not\nreach the target group in the same quality and quantity. There appears to be\nsome  leakage  (malpractice)  in  the  chain  of  distribution.  But  neither  the\nFood and Civil Supplies Department nor the government seems to have a\nway to stop this.\n\nDemand  and  supply  are  in  seeming  mismatch  where  cardholder\npreferences regarding the quality of rice  are concerned. People in the urban\nareas prefer raw rice and wheat, while those in the rural areas look for boiled\nrice. But women in the households that were interviewed said that they had\nshifted to the open market mainly because the rationed items were not always\navailable in the preferred quality when needed. The dealers themselves claim\nnot to know for sure when the preferred quality will be available. The FCI\nstates that it has sufficient stocks of both raw and boiled rice, and that these\nare distributed according to the approved request presented by fair-price\nshopkeepers. An assessment should be made and allotments based on regional\npreferences. The weekly indent form (submitted by dealers) may be suitably\nmodified so that the requirements for raw or boiled rice and wheat, based\non the cardholders\u2019 preferences, can be separately indicated. After the demand\nfor raw and boiled rice in the district is assessed, a computerized inventory\nmanagement and distribution system may be introduced to ensure fair and\nequitable allotment and distribution of rationed articles at the district and regional\nlevel. In the matter of quality, though the grains released from FCI pass its\nquality control test (which, among other things, limits moisture content and\nthe proportion of broken rice), this is still no guarantee that the people of Kerala\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n166\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fTargeted Public Distribution System: Lessons from a Food-Deficit State In India\n\n167\n\nwill find the grains to their satisfaction. Since quality is a major issue, the following\nstrategy options, short as well as long term, are suggested:\n\n(cid:127) Augment domestic production, especially of rice.\n(cid:127) Allocate food subsidy in cash to the state, and give the states autonomy\nin implementation so that specific regional needs can be taken care\nof.\nProcure  paddy  from  local  farmers  at  the  minimum  support  price,\nand provide for centralized processing and distribution through ration\nshops.\n\n(cid:127)\n\nMonitoring by Civic/Local Bodies and Their Involvement\n\nThe keystone of the PDS is the fair-price shop and the kingpin is the\nretail dealer. The success of the system depends on how efficiently and effectively\nthe shops are run. Hence, supervision is extremely important. Though various\nguidelines have been issued from time to time to restructure the system, many\nof  these  have  either  remained  on  paper  or  have  not  been  implemented\nsuccessfully. The central Government in 1999 issued guidelines and emphasized\nthe need to form vigilance committees with the involvement of panchayat raj\ninstitutions at all levels to ensure greater public participation. The vigilance\ncommittees have yet to be formed and empowered to monitor the functioning\nof fair-price shops.\n\nThe field visits revealed that in areas where there is healthy participation\nby  local  bodies  and  nongovernmental  organizations,  the  system  has  been\nextremely beneficial for the poor and the needy. The involvement of the local\ngroups  made  the  operations  of  the  fair-price  shops  more  transparent  and\naccountable; effective monitoring of the PDS reduced leakages and corruption.\n\nCardholder Awareness\n\nKerala has 100% literacy. Yet in many cases the AAY cardholders are not\naware of their entitlement or price. Because allotments come irregularly and\nare often inadequate, and cardholders are misinformed about the sufficiency\nof  allotments,  the  ration  dealers  often  dictate  the  price  and  the  quantity\ndispensed. While admitting that they sold goods from the allotments of non-\nbuyers, some dealers were quick to add that they also made goods available to\nthe poor. The field survey, however, revealed that they did so at higher prices.\nA model citizens\u2019 charter was prepared in 1997 by the Central Ministry,\nbut it has not yet been adopted by the state. This charter stipulates entitlements,\nthe procedure for the issue of ration cards, the public\u2019s right to know, and\nother essential information. It is high time that citizens\u2019 charters are published\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n167\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f168\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nand circulated. The publication of the charter will help make the people more\naware of their rights and the PDS staff and dealers more efficient, and thereby\nhelp weed out corruption.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nThe sustainability of the PDS is a matter of concern. To quote the High\nLevel Committee report: \u201c[T]he introduction of targeting has not reduced\nthe expenditure on the food subsidy while it has at the same time weakened\nthe impact of price stabilization and weakened the overall system.\u201d According\nto the present study, however, despite the inherent weaknesses of the PDS and\ngrowing customer dissatisfaction, the participation rate of the middle- and\nlow-income groups in PDS is still more than 72%. The \u201creal poor\u201d who have\nbeen excluded from the BPL list still depend on the PDS every month for\nsubsidized food grains. The PDS has also earned praise for its role in providing\nfree rations during crises like the tsunami. Indeed, the system of subsidized\nfood distribution to the needy is of paramount significance in the food-deficit\nstate of Kerala.\n\nWith the difference between the BPL and market prices much larger\nnow (more than Rs5 per kg) there is certainly a stronger incentive to divert\nsupplies to the open market and make a quick profit. As Mooij (1996) observed\nin a study on Bihar, \u201c[I]t was difficult for the PDS dealers to make profits\nwithout being corrupt.\u201d The commission they get is quite low and the dealers\nseem to have shifted the burden of increased transportation, handling, and\nholding costs to the poor in the form of lower quality and improper billing.\nSuch leakage, coupled with exclusions in targeting, implies that the subsidy\ndoes not always reach the poor in its entirety. The multiplicity of schemes in\nthe  system  and  the  large  number  of  PDS  implementers,  including  -  Food\nCorporation  of  India,  government  departments,  private  wholesale  dealers,\nand  retail  dealers,  have  severely  undermined  the  capacity  of  the  system  to\nserve the needs of the poor (Goetz and Jenkins 2002).\n\nReverting to a system of allocating grains at a uniform price with universal\ncoverage may not be feasible at present as the government may be constrained\nby the fiscal squeeze. As experts like Madhura Swaminathan suggest, geographic\ntargeting with a focus on slums, and on tribal and coastal areas with a high\nconcentration of poor people, is a better option. Participatory community-\nbased targeting with the help of Kudumbasree and women\u2019s groups can well\nbe tested in Kerala, as long as the program is apolitical. This can ensure that\nthe PDS meets the entire food requirements of the poor and is not exploited\nby the traders and the elite.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n168\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fTargeted Public Distribution System: Lessons from a Food-Deficit State In India\n\n169\n\nMany of the pertinent guidelines issued by the central Government are\nnot yet in effect. Those guidelines should be implemented immediately rather\nthan having new ones drawn up. Vigilance committees should be formed at\nvarious levels, the citizens\u2019 charter published and disseminated, supervision\nstrengthened  at  all  levels,  the  targeted  poor  made  more  aware  of  their\nentitlements and the price of commodities, and the APL/BPL list revised by\nthe government as a matter of priority, if the desired objectives of TPDS are to\nbe achieved.\n\nKerala needs a more consistent set of policies. These would range from\nstrategies  that  promote  the  growth  of  the  agriculture  sector  to  a  more\ncommunity-oriented PDS that involves all major actors in the distribution\nchain. The state government also needs to address new challenges on the human\ndevelopment front, including security for its growing population of the aged.\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n169\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\f170\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nReferences\n\nDevereux, Stephen. 1999.

Information and communication\ntechnology  (ICT)  can  facilitate  access  to  development-related  and  other\ninformation  for  rural  and  poor  communities.  Information  kiosks  can  be\ncatalysts  of  development  by  providing  such  access  for  governance\n(e-governance).\n\nThe  rapidly  falling  costs  and  new  developments  in  technology  (for\nexample, broadband networks and emerging wireless opportunities, especially\nWi-Fi and WiMAX) and deregulation allow the cost-effective provision of\nrural connectivity for development and e-governance.\n\nHowever, public (regulatory agency, local administration, etc.) and private\nagencies  (service  and  content  providers)  must  work  together  for  the  ICT\nprojects to succeed. Public administration is critical in managing the regulatory\nframework, carrying out policy advocacy, coordinating with the rural citizens,\nand providing visibility to the government\u2019s efforts.\n\nTo assess the significance of key areas of influence and action for public\nadministration in the provision of rural ICT access, we carried out four case\nstudies in different states in India. The case studies were on the Community\nInformation Centers project in Nagaland,2 the n-Logue project in Karnataka\nand Tamil Nadu,3 the Grameen Sanchar Seva Organization (GRASSO) project\nin  West  Bengal,4  and  the  Akshaya  project  in  Kerala.5 The  projects  cover\nsubstantial  numbers  of  villages  and  use  a  variety  of  wireless  technologies\n\n1\n\nProfessor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, India.\n\n2 www.meghalaya.nic.in/blocks/about.htm\n3 www.n-logue.com\n4 www.grasso.in\n5 www.akshaya.net\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n171\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f172\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\n(WLL-CDMA, VSAT, etc.). Appendix 1 shows the spread of the projects.\nThese  case  studies  gave  us  an  opportunity  to  study  the  role  of  public\nadministrators and local citizens, operating costs, training, vendor support,\nand appropriate technology. The studies were based on primary and secondary\ndata,  and  extensive  interactions  with  the  people  concerned.  Details  of  the\nstudies are available on request.6\n\nWe evaluated the projects and drew lessons for similar projects of funding\nagencies, governments, and private enterprises. The evaluation provided for\nspecific  roles  for  the  various  public  agencies  and  policy  guidelines  for  the\ngovernment.  The  guidelines  are  intended  as  a  road  map  for  public\nadministration agencies in achieving a more harmonious society.\n\nCommunity Information Center (CIC) Project\n\nProject Background\n\nThe North Eastern (NE) states, isolated from the mainstream and with\nhostile  terrain  and  poor  availability  of  power,  pose  a  challenge  to  any\ndevelopment effort, especially those related to ICT. To reduce the isolation of\nthese communities and mainstream them, a project of the Department of\nInformation Technology (DIT), a central government department, provided\nat least two community information centers (CICs) per block in the NE states\nand Sikkim to address the education, health, information, entertainment, and\nother  basic  needs  of  citizens. The  CICs  were  to  serve  as  a  platform  for\ne-governance, e-learning, and other IT-enabled services in the states.\n\nThe CIC project is a joint effort of DIT, the National Informatics Center\n(NIC), and the NE state governments. As of July 2005, nearly 500 CICs had\nbeen set up and a decision had been made to extend the project to other parts\nof the country, beginning with Jammu and Kashmir because of the similarity\nof the terrain.\n\nTechnology and Configuration at the Kiosks\n\nThe CIC project uses very small aperture terminals (VSATs) to connect\nto the main servers that are a part of NIC\u2019s nationwide network linking the\ndistrict headquarters across the states. The network architecture is shown in\nAppendix 2. Each CIC is housed in a relatively good-quality building and\n\n6 These studies were done as part of a report to the World Bank and the Department of Telecom,\nIndia, titled Policy Recommendations on Accelerated Provision of Rural Telecom Services.

NIC7  is  the  implementing  agency.  Application  software\ndevelopment and the training of CIC operators (CICOs) is part of NIC\u2019s\nresponsibilities. The state governments select, prepare, and maintain the sites;\nrecruit manpower; and identify and create content for the various services\ndelivered through the CICs.\n\nThe project plan envisages manpower support from DIT and NIC for 5\nyears. NIC is also to provide technical and maintenance support during this\nperiod, and DIT and NIC is to continue to provide satellite connectivity after\nthat  time. The  CICs  are  then  to  be  handed  over  to  the  respective  state\ngovernments, which must evolve a viable business model to make the CICs\nself-sustaining. The private sector can collaborate with the government for\neffective service delivery. However, the plan does not provide a specific road\nmap.\n\nEach CIC has two CICOs to manage the centers, provide services to the\npublic, and give training to visitors in basic computer operations and software\npackages. They are paid a salary by NIC.\n\nBusiness Model\n\nAccording  to  top  NIC  officials,  the  CICs  were  not  envisaged  as\ncommercial ventures. Their objective is to provide connectivity. But with the\nspread of such telecenters and the constraints on state government finance,\nthere  has  been  pressure  on  the  state  governments  to  make  the  CICs\ncommercially viable.\n\nThe  CICOs  can  charge  a  nominal  fee  from  the  local  population  for\ne-mail, Internet services, or training, to cover electricity, consumables, and\nother operating expenses.\n\n7 The  National  Informatics  Center  is  the  provider  of  a  national  backbone  and  the  implementing\nagency under the Department of Information Technology for central and state government IT projects,\nincluding e-governance projects.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n173\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f174\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nEvaluation\n\nThe hilly terrain in the NE states added to the challenges of technology\ndeployment, equipment vendor management, central and state department\ncoordination, local staff training, and sustainability. Many CICs did well and\nserved the purpose for which they were set up, but others did less well. An\nanalysis of the problems faced by those other CICs would help us do better\nnext time.\n\nRecent CIC models have shown that CICOs must have an entrepreneurial\nmind set for the CICs to succeed. In the CICs that I visited, operators often\nviewed themselves not in a business development role but as typical government\nemployees  receiving  a  fixed  salary  regardless  of  the  output.  While  a  good\nnumber of other CICOs had taken the initiative to run the establishments as\ncommercial projects, a business orientation is unlikely to develop unless CICOs\nbuild  a  greater  stakeholding  in  the  running  of  the  CICs.  In  other  similar\ninitiatives (n-Logue, Akshaya) the operators made at least partial investments\nin their telecenters.\n\nSince the availability of electricity was a major concern, the CIC project\nprovided generators. Many of these became nonfunctional, and CICs stopped\noperating, because of difficulties in procuring diesel and repairing the generators\nlocally. Also, some of the money that was spent on  hardware, air conditioners\n(which  guzzle  electricity),  and  huge  television  sets  could  have  been  better\ninvested in solar panels or micro hydro enterprises to ensure continuous power.\nWithout such assurance, a CIC that relied solely on personal computers (PCs)\nfor its operations soon became useless.\n\nThe hardware (PCs, antenna direction setting) also had to be sturdy, as\nit was difficult to get service personnel to remote locations. Since maintenance\nwas done centrally from Delhi, a hardware malfunction could keep a CIC out\nof operation for at least 5 days\u2014often longer\u2014because of the difficult terrain\nand the service agreements worked out with the vendors. Spare parts were\nalso centrally requisitioned. Moreover, there were no data at the state level for\nanalyzing performance. By making the maintenance bids competitive, DIT\nhopes to reduce the costs of maintenance and make the CICs more sustainable.\nTraining local people and giving them adequate incentives would have\nhelped the project. But until the CICs could provide accredited training, it\nwould be difficult for them to get students for training. Moreover, most CICOs\nhad been trained only to provide support for CIC users and were not equipped\nto offer formal training.\n\nSince the CICs had only data services and limited voice-over-Internet\nprotocol  (VoIP)  services  (according  to  the  regulations  of  the  Telecom\nRegulatory Authority of India), they were of limited use to the general public.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n174\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fRole of Public Administration in Facilitating Rural Telecommunications and ICT\n\n175\n\nPublic applications were few and not many CICs used them. Otherwise, one\ncould well imagine a rural citizen visiting a CIC to make a phone call at first\nand  then,  over  time,  using  other  services  and  contributing  to  the  revenue\n(Jain and Sastry 1997, 1999).\n\nThe limited functioning of the CICs also reflected the compartmentalized\nthinking in government departments. DIT and the Department of Telecom\n(DOT) should have worked together to see to it that the CICs offered both\nvoice and data services.\n\nCollaboration between DOT and DIT could have improved funds flow\nas well. The CICs could have received funding from the Universal Service\nObligation Fund (USOF). In addition, since USOF funding required reports\non operations, the working of the CICs would have been monitored. Of course,\nall this would need to be linked to the availability of electricity and better\nmechanisms for rectifying problems related to hardware and VSAT functioning.\nThe location of the CICs likewise affected their revenue potential. Some\nCICs were housed in office buildings that were not centrally located. CICs\nthat were close to schools generated more revenue, the major customers being\nschoolchildren, for e-mail, online chats, and computer training. DOT had\nlearned this lesson when it implemented its scheme of providing a phone in\nevery village. Placing the phone in the house of the village head (sarpanch)\nhad made it inaccessible to a large number of people. Hence, very little revenue\nwas generated. DOT later switched to providing village phones in public places.\nAn informal review in one of the states suggested that nearly half of the\nCICs may have stopped operating. Without a proper monitoring system and\nreports, however, an accurate assessment was difficult.\n\nGiven the difficult economic situation in the NE states, the CICOs could\nhave been provided loans at rates substantially below the market. For this, the\ncentral government needed to coordinate with state government. But despite\nthe limitations of the CIC operations, the initiative was highly valued by the\nlocal people, who saw it as a sign of the government\u2019s interest in their well-\nbeing.\n\nn-Logue project\n\nProject Background\n\n8 www.tenet.res.in\n\nDeveloped by the TeNeT Group and the Indian Institute of Technology\nMadras (IITM) Chennai,8 n-Logue was established by Vishal Bharat Comnet,\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n175\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f176\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\na trust set up by several alumni of IITM Chennai and the IT industry.

Its  major  contribution  has  been  an\nindigenous wireless solution based on an internally developed standard called\ncorDECT. The specific design choices in implementing corDECT have helped\nto reduce costs.\n\nTo provide a total cost-effective system solution, TeNeT has put up several\ncompanies such as Midas Communications,9 which markets corDECT and\nother wireless solutions, and Banyan Networks,10 which developed the RAS\nInternet switching technology.\n\nn-Logue\u2019s mission is \u201cto fulfill the need for Internet and voice services in\nevery underserved small town and village in India.\u201d It believes that the potential\ndemand for Internet services in these areas is huge and largely unfulfilled.

The LSPs identified the individual kiosk operators,\nprovided the services, and collected the payments. At the bottom level were\nthe individual operators of the kiosks, who provided the services to the villagers\nand collected the payments from them.\n\nWhile n-Logue had the responsibility for identifying the LSP, which was\nusually an established local businessperson (say, a cable TV operator), the LSP\nthat had to identify the village entrepreneurs who would set up the village\nkiosks  under  the  \u201cChirag\u201d  brand  name.  n-Logue  set  up  the  access  centers\nwhile the LSP collected payments and marketed the services offered by the\nkiosks  to  both  government  and  private  enterprises.  n-Logue  also  provided\ntechnical assistance in setting up the access center and the village kiosks. This\nincluded field surveys to locate the Base Transceiver Station12 (BTS) , and\ntechnical training for both the LSP staff and the kiosk operators.\n\nn-Logue had developed a variety of content (CDs for 10th- and 12th-\nclass students that were specifically designed for rural students), providing\nmedical and veterinary help through videoconferencing, a Microsoft Office\u2013\nlike package in Tamil, videoconferencing software that used high compression\nto  enable  transmission  of  high-quality  video  images  over  the  existing\nbandwidth,  etc.  Potential  future  services  included  linking  to  existing\ncomputerized land records, wireless ATMs, and tele-medicine.\n\n12 The cellular network hierarchy consists of the handset, Base Station Controller (BSC),  Base Transceiver\nStation  (BTS),  and  the  Master  Switching  Center  (MSC).The  BTS  contains  the  equipment  for\ntransmitting and receiving of radio signals (transceivers), antennas, and equipment for encrypting\nand decrypting communications with the BSC and the MSC.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n177\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f178\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nPartnerships\n\npartnerships as follows:\n\nAn  integral  part  of  the  n-Logue  model  was  the  management  of\n\n(cid:127) Backbone  and  Internet  service  providers.  n-Logue  formed\npartnerships with the existing private and government telecom service\nproviders and the Internet bandwidth provider (Satyam Infoway) to\ngive Internet access to the kiosk operator\u2019s clients.\n\n(cid:127) Content providers. n-Logue partnered with several initiatives at the\nTeNeT Group, local doctors, and veterinary and extension workers.\n\n(cid:127)\n\nState governments (Maharashtra) for the funding of the kiosks.\n\n(cid:127) Hardware  suppliers.  n-Logue  procured  hardware  from  Midas\nCommunication (corDECT technology); Banyan Networks (RAS);\nHCL (PCs); Consul and Alacrity (UPS with battery); HP, Epson,\nand Wipro (printers); Cygnus (modems); Dax Networks (switches);\nNortel and Cisco (routers); and Honda (generators).\n\nBusiness Model\n\nEach access center costs around Rs4.5 million,13 split between the LSP\n(around Rs1.2 million) and n Logue. Each LSP covers 30\u2013200 villages. The\nfirst Rs3 million of the access center cost goes to the setting up of the basic\ninfrastructure, while the remaining Rs1.5 million is used for expansion. The\nLSP pays Rs200,000 for agency fees, Rs500,000 as refundable security deposit,\nand Rs500,000 for equipment. Revenue is shared 50:50 between the LSP and\nn-Logue.\n\nThe village operator invests Rs50,000 and pays the rent, electricity, etc.\nIn extreme shortage of power, an additional investment of Rs10,000 for petrol-\nstarted,  kerosene-run  400  volt-ampere  (VA)  generators  may  be  required.\nTypically, a village operator pays Rs400\u2013500 per month for rent, electricity,\netc..The operator will also have to pay the bank loan over the next 4\u20136 months,\nat Rs1,500 a month, and pay Rs2,500 monthly to n-Logue for Internet access\nfrom the seventh month onward.

On the basis of recent data showing\n125% growth in kiosks per quarter, ROI was estimated at 199% over a 5-year\nperiod and the return to the village operator at 299%, ensuring 50% revenue\ngrowth through data services (Paul 2004).

The core\nteam at IITM Chennai had to have a rural mind set.\n\nThe delivery system was designed so that each activity had a dedicated\ncompany (MIDAS, OOPS, n-Logue, etc.) for specific tasks and deliverables.\nManaging these diverse organizations was no easy task, as the companies had\nto be self-sufficient. Since these companies were focused on rural deployment,\nearning enough to cover costs and also be profitable was a challenge. While\nknowledge of urban service delivery models and markets was fairly readily\navailable, managing and marketing services in rural areas was not that well\nunderstood. Additionally, as n-Logue expanded its operations, it had to address\nvarious technological and management challenges:\n\n(cid:127) The  future  evolution  of  corDECT  might  have  to  incorporate\n\ndevelopments in packet-based Wi-Fi and WiMAX.\n\n(cid:127) Availability of power was a major issue. A 12-volt, 50-watt solar panel\ncosts about Rs8,000\u201310,000, thus increasing the cost to the kiosk\noperator.\nn-Logue could not bid for USOF funding, as only service providers\nwith a license for fixed-line, cellular, or unified access service were\nallowed to do so.\n\n(cid:127)\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n179\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f180\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127) The  provision  of  kiosks  had  to  be  integrated  with  existing\ndevelopmental programs such as the Prime Minister\u2019s Gram Swarajya\nYojana (Integrated Village Development Program) or with self-help\ngroups.\nn-Logue\u2019s ability to form partnerships and maintain them was critical\nto its growth, as pointed out above. It had to be able to get volume\ndiscounts  on  hardware  and  continued  access  to  developments  in\ntechnology to enable effective low-cost operations in the villages. As\nn-Logue planned to expand rapidly, it had to exercise due diligence\nin selecting LSPs and monitoring the operators\u2019 performance.\n(cid:127) Despite  collaborations  with  banks  at  the  district  level,  local\ndisbursements were often slow, since the banks may have lent earlier\nto the villagers and the loans may not have been repaid.\n\n(cid:127) Expanding operations could be a problem, since the n-Logue team\nhad to identify the LSPs that were willing to invest Rs1\u20131.5 million\nup front. In many talukas or districts, this could cause delays, unless\nthe success of the model was already widely known. n-Logue also had\nto help the LSPs package the services for the villages. While some of\nthe services could be centrally provided, the n-Logue model depends\nheavily on localized services such as tie-ups with local doctors and\nother service providers. This could take time.\n\n(cid:127) As n-Logue was growing very fast, it would need to manage its internal\ngrowth. The  ability  to  manage  its  costs,  recruit  the  right  people,\nmanage vendor relationships, and retain a core group of professionals\nwould be important for future growth.\n\n(cid:127) Many kiosk owners hired temporary operators on low wages. Hence,\nturnover was high, and it became even more difficult for n-Logue to\nprovide training.\n\n(cid:127) The criteria for selecting village beneficiaries and LSPs were important.\nIn  some  instances  where  the  process  was  not  adequately  followed\n(Maharashtra), n-Logue had mixed results.\n\nGrameen Sewa Sanchar Organization (GRASSO)\n\nProject Background\n\nGrameen Sewa Sanchar Organization (GRASSO) in West Bengal was\nan  NGO  whose  aim  was  to  form  a  self-sufficient  rural  India  with  self-\nemployment schemes generating income and wealth for the rural population.\nGRASSO intended to integrate dispersed rural resources into an IT-enabled\ndistribution  network  to  benefit  the  rural  economy.

The ultimate aim was to\nconnect the rural economies not only within India but to the vast markets of\nthe globe. GRASSO also aimed to provide other value-added information\nand services to the villages. In the phase described below, GRASSO took over\nthe  management  of  the  wireless  local  loop  (WLL)  (code  division  multiple\naccess [CDMA]) network of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. (BSNL), India\u2019s top\nInternet service provider.\n\nManagement Structure\n\nWhile reluctant at first to work with an NGO, BSNL, after checking\nGRASSO\u2019s credentials, realized that GRASSO was effectively managing the\nWLL  installations.  BSNL  therefore  planned  to  formalize  the  relationship\nthrough a memorandum of understanding.\n\nTo manage its operations, GRASSO had developed a centrally controlled\ninformation system (CCIS). A computerized database, which was analyzed\non 78 parameters, was used in selecting the beneficiaries. Data were collected\nwith the help of a questionnaire designed by a national marketing organization\n(ORG-MARG). Locations were likewise selected through a database, and one\nphone was provided for every 1,000 people.\n\nA  potential  beneficiary  could  enroll  with  GRASSO  after  paying  a\nregistration fee of Rs500 and a form fee of Rs50. GRASSO also charged a one-\ntime connection fee of Rs1,000 per connection. After evaluation, the beneficiary\nwas given a handset to start offering public call office (PCO) services.\n\nAfter the start of service, GRASSO collected the bills from BSNL and\ndistributed  them  in  the  villages. Then  it  collected  the  payments  from  the\nPCO operator and paid BSNL. GRASSO also pushed for other services. For\nexample, it worked with the top BSNL management at the state level for the\napproval of the annual maintenance contract (AMC) for village telephones.\n\nBusiness Model\n\nIn  the  first  phase,  GRASSO  took  over  the  management  of  the WLL\n(CDMA) network of BSNL. The phones had been provided or were to be\nprovided by BSNL in rural areas for PCO facilities to selected beneficiaries.\nThe towers (BTS) and other infrastructure had been set up by BSNL. GRASSO\nwas  the  \u201cbulk  franchisee\u201d  for  the  service.  It  took  part  in  selecting  the\nbeneficiaries and facilitating operations (by creating a log of problems, analyzing\nthem,  and  following  up  their  resolution  with  BSNL).  GRASSO  was  also\ninvolved in bill collection and payment to BSNL on behalf of the beneficiaries.\nAs of December 2004, it was operating in eight districts.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n181\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f182\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nSince GRASSO\u2019s involvement in the project, revenues for BSNL from\nthe selected areas have gone up significantly. The monthly revenue from the\nnearly 1,000 phones in the GRASSO project has been around Rs3\u20134 million,\ninstead of the few thousand rupees generated earlier (Appendix 4). The PCO\noperator had to invest Rs13,380 for the WLL PCO sets and patch panel and\nhad to spend Rs4,000 more for the security deposit and management fees, for\na  total  of  Rs17,380.  Of  this  amount,  Rs2,000  came  from  the  individual\ncontributions and the remaining Rs15,380 could be covered by a loan.\n\nAppendix 4 shows the average revenue per phone. The earning potential\nvaried from Rs200 to nearly Rs1,000 (at 20% share of revenue for the operator).\nWhile revenue of less than Rs500\u2013800 may not be profitable for the operator,\nlower bill amounts usually indicate a later start of operations. In most cases,\nthe bill amounts tended to go up as the operations went on. Usually operators\nalso charged for incoming calls, and most villagers did not mind paying. This\namount is not reflected in the table. So, in reality the amounts earned were\nhigher than those shown here. The very high percentage of bills collected also\nindicates the operational efficiency of GRASSO.\n\nEvaluation\n\nThe CDMA network, which was supported by the local government,\nhad many technical problems. The engineers did not give effective support in\nthe field. Relying on service engineers from Korea was expensive and caused\ndisruptions and delays in services.\n\nThe BSNL billing process was lengthy, and delays in billing caused the\namounts billed to accumulate. The villagers often found it difficult to pay the\nlarge amounts all at one time.\n\nFunding for potential operators was not easily available at the branches.\nDespite various meetings with the state governments and the state and district\nbanking committees, not a single case was financed by the banks in the first\nphase of the project.\n\nThe villages worked out innovative solutions for charging handsets, as\n\nmany GRASSO locations had never been electrified.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n182\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fRole of Public Administration in Facilitating Rural Telecommunications and ICT\n\n183\n\nAkshaya Project\n\nProject Background14\n\nThe Akshaya project, under the Kerala government, was started at the\nrequest of the local self-governance (LSG) bodies in the villages, which were\nin turn responding to the need for alternative employment opportunities for\nthe people in Mallapuram district. Among the districts in Kerala, Mallapuram\nhad the largest number of people working abroad (mostly in Gulf countries)\nbut ranked third or fourth in remittances, indicating that those who were\nworking abroad were mostly employed in lower-value jobs. Moreover, a few\nyears back there was pressure in the Gulf countries to award these lower-level\njobs to their own citizens. The LSGs in Mallapuram therefore had to think of\nemployment alternatives, and IT training emerged as a possibility.\n\nApproached for help by the LSGs, the Kerala State IT Mission (KSITM)\n\ndecided to design and implement an e-literacy program called Akshaya.15\n\nManagement Structure\n\nKSITM provided the concept, and implemented and coordinated the\nproject. Under the IT secretary, there was a mission coordinator, and an assistant\nmission  coordinator.  The  Department  of  Science  and  Technology  for\nEntrepreneurial Development of the central Government paid the salaries of\nthe four project coordinators. The other staff costs were borne by KSITM.\n\nThe basic design elements of Akshaya were (i) the setting up of 4,500\u2013\n6,000  Akshaya  centers  (ACs)  across  the  state,  with  one  AC  for  every  two\nwards of the local body, so that there was an AC within 2 kilometers (km) of\nany house; (ii) connectivity to the telecommunication network; (iii) at least\n15 hours of IT training for at least one member from each of the 0.65 million\nfamilies in the district; and (iv) the management of each AC by an entrepreneur,\nwho had to invest in a PC and connectivity. The investment would be recovered\nthough a service charge on a number of services, such as computer training,\ncollection of utility bills, and taxes.\n\nAkshaya  was  planned  as  a  hierarchical  network,  with  three  levels  of\nconnectivity at the district, subdistrict, and village levels. The connectivity to\nthe backbone would be funded by the state government and the Department\nof IT, Kerala.\n\n14 www.itu.int/osg/spu/wsis-themes/ict_stories/Informationkeralamissioncasestudy.html\n15 Akshaya means indestructible and everlasting.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n183\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f184\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nThe KSITM team had to design the network itself, as the existing NIC\nnetwork operated only up to the district level and was erratic. The public\noperator (BSNL) was unwilling to share costs, even though greater use of the\nproposed network would increase traffic in BSNL\u2019s own network.\n\nTechnology and Configuration at the Kiosks\n\nChoice of Network Technology. The geographic characteristics of the\nstate,  including  a  rural-urban  continuum,  an  uneven  terrain,  and  dense\nvegetation, created challenges for the choice of wireless technology.\n\ncorDECT was not selected because of the expected bandwidth limitations\nand  problems  with  non-LOS  transmission.  Non-LOS  transmission  was  an\nimportant requirement in the specific terrain. VSAT was ruled out, as the coverage\nwould depend on the satellite footprint and the cost was deemed too high.\nVOIP, which could be a killer application given the number of those working\nabroad, could have problems from the latency delays in a VSAT application.\nOther solutions were more expensive and did not perform adequately.\n\nOn  the  basis  of  several  considerations,  such  as  lower  cost,  non-LOS\ntransmission, and scalability, KSITM selected Tulip IT, India, as the network\nsolution provider. The provider proposed a Wi-LAN solution for the backbone\nand WipLL16 for the access network.\n\nThe backbone and the access network use two separate systems:\n\n(cid:127) Backbone  technology. The  backbone  uses  a  proprietary  wireless\ntechnology from Wi LAN, Canada. It operates in the 2.4 gigahertz\n(GHz) range, achieving data rates of 11 megabits per second (Mbps).\nA single hop range is in excess of 20 km. It is based on WiMAX, an\nimplementation of the IEEE 802.16 standard. The LOS limitation\nwas  overcome  through  point-to-multipoint  transmission.  As  the\nnetwork grows, any node could be promoted to be a repeater. The\nnetwork  could  be  deployed  one  node  at  a  time.  Each  unit  is\nfunctionally  complete  to  operate  as  a  hub,  repeater,  or  end  node.\nFurther, the bridge could be configured as a bridge or as a router.\n(cid:127) Access network technology. This was implemented with the use of\nthe WipLL implementation of Air Span.17 The system could run in\n\n16 WipLL is a point-to-multipoint wireless wide area networking system that uses Internet protocol\n(IP) technology, with an operating range in excess of 10 km line of sight (LOS) and several kilometers\nnon-LOS.

Appendix 5 gives the details\nof the architecture.\n\nThe  Network  Operating  Center  (NOC)  provides  total  control  over\ncontent delivery in terms of connectivity, packet uploads and downloads, and\nsites visited. For example, many pornography sites have been blocked out.\nThe NOC keeps a complete record of all sites visited by all the ACs. It operates\nwith an 8-hour battery backup.\n\nKiosk Computer Configuration. Each AC has four to five computers\nand Internet connectivity. The initial specifications from KSITM were not\nmandatory. However, since the training programs specified by KSITM were\ngraphics- and image- oriented, a higher configuration was required. To qualify\nto be a training center, the AC had to follow the given specifications.\n\nBusiness Model\n\nEach AC requires the entrepreneurs to invest Rp300,000\u2013400,000 and\nto pay the recurring expenses (electricity and rent). The entrepreneurs also\npay the network operator Rs1,000 monthly for spectrum and connectivity\ncharges.\n\nThe  backbone  was  provided  on  a  build-operate-transfer  model. The\nDepartment  of  IT,  Kerala,  gave  Rs36  million  and  owns  the  network. The\noperator is free to provide connectivity to other entities. But government entities\ndo not have to pay for the bandwidth.\n\nFor a 15-hour training module designed by KSITM and priced at Rs140,\nRs80  is  contributed  by  the gram  panchayat,  Rs20  by  the  block  panchayat,\nRs20  by  the  district  panchayat,  and  Rs20  by  the  beneficiary.  KSITM  has\ncontracted the training to a training agency.\n\nLoans  for  entrepreneurs  have  been  worked  out  with  public  financial\ninstitutions. At the highest level, both the state and district bankers committees\nsupported this initiative, although branches were often reluctant to provide\nthe loans, as these were to be without collateral and about 60% of the loan\nwas  to  be  repaid  directly  from  the  e-literacy  training  fee  paid  by  each  AC\nentrepreneur.\n\nThe Center for Development of Imaging Technology (C-DIT) provided\nseveral  educational  CDs  such  as  the  popular  ones  on  Spoken  English  and\nArabic, and a health facilities database.\n\nKSITM and C-DIT provided 2-day training to the trainers for the e-\nliteracy project, preceded by heavy campaigning. About 68% of the trainees\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n185\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f186\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nwere women. The setting up of the AC was perhaps viewed by women as a\npositive opportunity to earn money without having to leave the house for\nlong.\n\nEvaluation\n\nThe availability of power continues to be a major issue, not only at the\ncustomer premises but also at the BTS. In some locations generators have\nbeen installed, but have to be started manually.\n\nSeveral nodes are not connected because of the non-LOS constraint.\nAC entrepreneurs are concerned about the status of the project after a\n\ngovernment change.\n\nKSITM does not have a clear role in developing the business plan for\nthe ACs, especially those that seek to provide commercial activity over the\nnetwork for organizations like ICICI and insurance companies.\n\nThe cost of interconnectivity to the public switched telephone network\n\n(PSTN) is perceived to be high.\n\nCustomers are usually charged a premium for paying the bills at ACs or\nfor transacting business through ACs. This model is acceptable to the villagers,\nas they would otherwise have to travel someplace else and spend money and\ntime to pay their bills. A more attractive model would be where both the\nservice provider and the villagers benefit. The villager could pay a slightly\nlower bill, and the early payment would give the company enough premium\nto accept a lower payment.\n\nLower electricity tariffs could apply if the AC were treated as a small-\n\nscale industry instead of a commercial enterprise.\n\nIt was envisaged that government would provide some relevant content\nin  the  local  language  and  facilitate  the  provision  of  the  network  for\ndissemination. For example, activities such as the computerization of panchayat\nrecords could be routed to the centers.\n\nThe backbone has not been used as envisaged because of technological\nproblems. Since this is the first project to use the new technology, a tie-up\nwith educational institutes like the Indian Institute of Technology, the National\nInstitute  of Technology,  or  the  Rural  Electrification  Corporation  could  be\nuseful. The important issue for governments is whether to adopt proprietary\ntechnology or open standards. This choice is made more complex in a fast-\nchanging  area  of  technology  where  standards  are  still  evolving  and  private\nentities could influence the adoption of standards.\n\nCentral government agencies such as NIC and BSNL (in providing co-\nlocation facilities) do not appear to have acted together in this initiative. This\npoints to the need for greater coordination across the state and central bodies.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n186\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fRole of Public Administration in Facilitating Rural Telecommunications and ICT\n\n187\n\nLessons Learned from the Projects\n\nThe more commercially viable projects were either those where the civil\nsociety/private entrepreneur (GRASSO, n-Logue) took the initiative or where\nthe public administration sought such partnerships (Akshaya). In contrast,\nthe CICs had no formal mechanism for such partnerships and did not do\nwell. Although commercial viability was not a stated goal of the CIC project,\neven in operational terms this project was not doing well.\n\nGiven the requirements of services in rural areas (high costs, poorer target\ngroups,  lack  of  technical  knowledge),  the  involvement  of  public  agencies  is\nimportant, as rural private enterprise by itself may not have enough resources to\nmanage the rollout of telecenters and their connectivity. On the other hand,\npublic administration by itself may not have the necessary incentives to make\nthe project commercially viable. Further, excluding the private sector could reduce\nthe innovation and context-specific knowledge that could drive telecenter use.\nSuccessful telecenter deployment requires the formalization of processes,\nsystems, and knowledge, as well as coordination with financial institutions\nand regulatory agencies. Such skills and resources may not be easily available\nin the countryside. Civil society or intermediating organizations could help\nbring together rural private enterprise and the public administration. While\nintermediaries generally introduce more transaction costs, in this case, the\ncomplexity  of  the  underlying  processes  (technology,  understanding  of\nregulations, financial support) and the inadequacy of resources at the rural\nprivate enterprises (knowledge, interface with incumbents) could cause the\nbenefits of ICT to be locked in and unavailable. Additional costs would be a\nsmall price to pay for unlocking those benefits.\n\nWe identify below the various dimensions of telecenter provision and\nevaluate the role of the private enterprise, public administration, and civil\nsociety along those dimensions.\n\nService Content\n\nThe case studies showed access to be more critical than content. While\ncontent is currently inadequate, and therefore kiosk operators use training,\ne-mail,  and  Web  browsing  to  generate  revenues,  some  private  banks  and\ninsurance companies have started to explore the infrastructure for rural service\ndelivery. The case studies highlighted the fact that the private operator had\nsignificant initiative and wherewithal to manage content. Civil society played\nan important part in identifying, generating, and managing content, as it had\nknowledge of actual requirements and could coordinate with the government\nagencies that might have relevant content. It may also have the expertise to\nidentify sources of content.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n187\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f188\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nThe government/public administration plays a critical part not only in\nfacilitating  the  provision  of  this  basic  infrastructure  but  also  in  the\ncomputerization and reengineering of its processes, and the delivery of citizen-\noriented services.\n\nPeople perceive training to be useful if it comes with certification. Training\ncontent therefore needs to be formalized. Such linkages could be established\nat the state level, for example. Public administration can play a critical part in\naccreditation.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nThe availability of power and good-quality and reliable connections are\n\nbottlenecks where public administration can and should act as facilitator.\n\nThe availability of power is a major concern in all projects. Therefore,\nalternative  power  sources  must  be  explored.  Subsidies  or  grants  for  using\nalternative power sources also need to be part of the projects. The Ministry of\nNon-Conventional  Energy  Sources  must  be  involved  in  the  design  and\ndevelopment of such projects.\n\nThe  new  initiatives  should  be  integrated  with  the  existing  state\ninfrastructure such as statewide area networks (Jain and Raghuram 200218).\nOn  the  above  two  aspects,  the  role  of  public  administration  is  more\n\ncritical than that of private enterprise. Civil society acts as coordinator.\n\nManagement\n\nThe following are areas where public administration has a major role:\n\n(cid:127) Easy  interconnectivity  terms,  model  contracts,  monitoring  of\noperational parameters, and lessening of bureaucratic control.\n(cid:127) Coordination  between  departments,  for  example,  between  central\ngovernment agencies such as NIC and BSNL, as noted above.\n\nPublic administration and civil society need to work together on the\n\nfollowing:\n\n(cid:127) Design  of  effective  awareness  campaigns.  n-Logue,  Akshaya,  and\nGRASSO have used this tool effectively to spread awareness about\ntheir projects.\n\n18 http://www.mit.gov.in/policyguidelinesforSWAN.pdf\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n188\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fRole of Public Administration in Facilitating Rural Telecommunications and ICT\n\n189\n\n(cid:127) Assessment of the technology to be used.

Banks and financial and credit agencies could provide\nfunding.\n\n(cid:127) The availability of USOF funds would facilitate the rollout of such\n\nprojects.\n\n(cid:127) The possibility of integrating the provision of kiosks with existing\ndevelopmental programs such as the Prime Minister\u2019s Gram Swarajya\nYojana or with self-help groups should be looked into.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile  the  role  of  public  administration  in  the  spread  of  rural\ntelecommunications, specifically in the deployment of telecenters, is significant,\nits effectiveness can be leveraged through the inclusion of the private sector and\ncivil society in rural telecommunication policy and plans. Civil society has a\ncritical role in managing the coordination between the public and private sectors.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n189\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f190\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nThe  deployment  of  infrastructure  does  not  merely  require  the  cost-\neffective  use  of  technology  and  careful  choice  of  robust  and  interoperable\nstandards\u2014where public administration has a critical role.

This prosperity is derived from the pursuit of private\nactions, driven by private motives. Differences in individual skills and beliefs\nare the bedrock of such private initiative and profits. Such differences, on the\nother  hand,  increase  the  possibility  that  social  harmony  will  be  lost. The\ncontinuance of a state structure, over the long run, therefore depends on the\ntwin  objectives  of  preserving  harmony  and  providing  the  individual  with\nadequate space to pursue private initiative. Public administration, as the arm\nof the state, is subject to this dichotomy as well. In countries such as India,\nwidespread poverty, particularly in rural areas, is a threat to both the above\nobjectives  of  public  administration.  Attempts  by  the  federal  government\n(central  government)  to  tackle  the  issue  by  financing  poverty  alleviation\nprograms and implementing them through the public administration systems\nhave not borne enough encouraging results. This paper attempts to search for\nreasons for such failures and in the process tentatively move toward a framework\nthat provides a better understanding and a guide for action.\n\nWe argue specifically in this paper that this failure to deal with poverty is\nan outcome of a wedge between conceptual and actionable knowledge, a wedge\nthat is perpetuated by the power structure. Conceptual knowledge is abstract,\nand it inspires imagination. Knowledge claims flowing from abstract concepts\ngenerated in elite discourse around conceptual knowledge lead to norms and\nrules that drive governance in the system; they lead to action. However, for the\npowerless governed, lacking strategic space, knowledge claims are often generated\nonly in action, since autonomous discourse in abstract knowledge is often lacking.\nYet, because the authors of such knowledge claims generated in action are so\npowerless, the claims are not celebrated. They are not elevated, and might even\nwither away. Such actionable knowledge claims of the powerless are therefore\nlike discourse that is not voiced or cannot be voiced, and often manifested in\n\n1 Assistant Professors, XLRI School of Management, Jamshedpur, India.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n196\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fPower, Public Administration, and Poverty: Rural Employment Program in India\n\n197\n\nmacabre forms of subversion of norms and rules of the system, which give rise\nto a sense of failure of governance among those with power as well. Power thus\nbrings actionable knowledge to the fore, but in two different forms. For the\npower holder, it takes the form of a deviation from norms and rules in the\nactionable  domain  through  subversion  by  the  powerless,  revealing  a  gap  in\nknowledge between the conceptual and the actionable domain that is reluctantly\n(often  tacitly)  tolerated.  For  the  powerless,  on  the  other  hand,  actionable\nknowledge is living\u2014negotiating on the deviation is an existential requirement.\nCentral to our schema is the argument that knowledge is generated and\nacted on within a context. These contexts are local and different. They are\noften spatial (e.g., rural-urban). Different strategic actors in different contexts,\ndwelling  in  what  sociologists  would  call  different  lifeworlds,  would  have\ndifferent incentives to act, and often different beliefs and skills. Yet, driven by\nthe  strategist\u2019s  desire  to  act  (and  govern),  a  conceptual  knowledge  claim\nassociated with power needs to take cognizance of a multiplicity of contexts,\nsince  governance  is  often  desired  across  overarching  structures  that  span\nmultiple contexts. The strategist with the associated knowledge claim must\nthen seek to understand the other over whom governance is sought, since the\nother is important to strategy. The strategist must peek into other contexts.\nWhile action and knowledge in the actionable domain are tied more firmly to\nthe local context, conceptual knowledge seeks to break out to embrace other\ncontexts. This is a major source of tension.\n\nThe  project  of  understanding  the  other,  which  is  so  important,  is,\nhowever, analytically most problematic. This understanding often flows from\nabstract  theories  and  concepts  developed  in  science  (as  in  economics  or\ndevelopment  planning)  by  communities  of  experts,  which  then  produce  a\nconceptual knowledge claim and an actionable agenda. From the perspective\nof actionable knowledge, this understanding also evolves through conflicts\nand through negotiations that actors undertake in the course of an action.\nMultiple contexts, different lifeworlds, and strategic actors dialogue at the\ninterface of contexts generated in practice. There is conflict and negotiation,\nand often the creation of new shared contexts and meanings. In the process,\npreconceived abstract concepts are redefined and reformulated, and conceptual\nknowledge claims are redefined as well. There is therefore a journey back and\nforth between conceptual (abstract) knowledge and the concrete actionable\nagenda.\n\nBut this process is not smooth, nor does it necessarily occur. A basic\nproposition of this paper is that this process is mediated by structures of power.\nThe multiple actors in multiple contexts most often have asymmetrical access\nto power: some are at the center and others at the periphery of a centralized\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n197\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f198\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nbureaucracy, or some are inside and others outside a formal power structure.\nIn most cases it is useful to visualize multiple actors as located in different\ntiers  of  a  hierarchy  of  power.  This  difference  in  power  has  important\nconnotations,  for  instance,  in  the  meaning  of  \u201cother\u201d  to  those  who  wield\npower and to those over whom power is wielded. Power alters the motivation\nto know the other. Power, moreover, is not an undifferentiated mass; it has\nmany shades, many domains. Different actors also differ with respect to the\ndomain over which they exercise power, and this difference often shapes the\nnegotiations and exchanges that occur at the interface of contexts. The \u201cfolk\nelite\u201d at the periphery of a power structure, for instance, may have the power\nto negotiate a local deal but not the power to influence a scientific discourse\n(often in abstract terms) at the center of the power structure. The different\ncontexts  are  therefore  laden  differentially  with  power.  State  and  its\nadministration  are  not  homogeneous,  and  differences  between  the  tiers  of\nadministration are important. This difference often has a geographic or a spatial\ndimension  as  well,  just  as  poverty  has  a  spatial  dimension  in  the  form  of\ndifference  in  intensity,  say,  between  urban  and  rural  poverty.  Public\nadministration therefore has connotations of spatial competition.\n\nKnowledge  and  power  thus  remain  enmeshed.  A  counterclaim  of\nknowledge must not only deconstruct the dominant knowledge claim, but\nmust also reclaim and reconfigure power. It is a strategic act. Reinterpretation\nof knowledge and reconfiguration of power proceed simultaneously, and this\nreclaiming is often important in creating the strategic space required to validate\nthe local (local skills, for instance). This also implies that a counterclaim to\nknowledge, which is counter-systemic, may fail at reinterpretation because it\nfails to reconfigure power. The counter-discourse may fail to take root, to find\na voice. The counter-discourse may also wither away. This is often associated\nwith de-skilling and the withering of local skills. The dominant conceptual\nknowledge claim remains unchallenged in the discourse space. It may then\ncontinue to retain salience even though it fails to deliver, to govern. Apologists\nwould then claim a failure in the implementation of a well-formulated strategy.\nSuch claims are widespread when discussing bureaucratic failures in private\ncorporations as well as state bureaucratic structures. We argue that there is no\nsuch thing as an implementation failure. The slip lies actually in a knowledge\nclaim  that  fails  to  perceive  the  other  adequately  because  of  its  inability  to\nengage in a dialogue with the counter-discourse. A counterclaim to knowledge,\nauthored by the other, fails to negotiate with the dominant claim in order to\nrevise it. The other, however, most often retains a stealthy freedom to subvert\n(which  is  deemed  illegitimate  within  the  dominant  knowledge  claim)  the\nstrategist\u2019s desires. We have a failure of governance.

We do not provide a data-rich, objective account.\nAs we will explain later, the process of information generation and processing\nis  itself  enmeshed  in  power  conflicts. There  are  significant  \u201cnoises\u201d  in  the\ndata, not often referred to in studies, where data, slightly removed from the\nmurky local context of their generation, become \u201cscientific\u201d and inviolable.\nWe reject much of structured data. We provide instead anecdotes, snippets of\nconversation, pieces of dialogue, and some pieces of evidence (often mined\nfrom structured data sets, but interpreted accordingly) that we came across.\nOur aim is to build up the discourse surrounding the scheme, between officials\nin different layers of the bureaucracy and those outside the bureaucratic power\nstructure\u2014the poor, landless peasants around whom the scheme is designed.\nAnd we interpret the conflicting discourse surrounding the rules of the scheme\nand its numerous breaches in implementation. We interpret power, the limits\nto power, and folk life\u2019s recalcitrant refusal to fully submit.\n\nThe  following  section  gives  a  brief  overview  of  poverty  alleviation\nprograms  in  India.  In  the  process  we  also  look  into  the  structure  of  the\nmultitiered state administrative apparatus and the debates around the location\nof power within different layers of state administration. The section after that\ngives details of the scheme (including rules or norms, on which we concentrate)\nand the roles of different agencies involved in implementation. We also take a\npeek into the folk world\u2014the local government (bureaucrats), the local elite\n(most often the elected representatives in local government bodies), and the\nlocal  poor  in  rural  areas  we  visited  to  observe  the  scheme  as  it  was  being\nimplemented. We confront multiple world-views, multiple lifeworlds. And\nfinally we make conclusions.\n\nPoverty Alleviation Programs in India\n\nDevelopment planners in India have grappled with the problem of rural\npoverty  for  a  long  time.  In  the  1970s,  direct  poverty  alleviation  programs\nproviding employment and consumption support for the lowest rungs of rural\nsociety began to be designed and sponsored by the central Government. These\nprograms were largely an outcome of increasing rural unrest and the realization\n\n2 The areas we visited are shown in the table in Appendix 1.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n199\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f200\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nthat large-scale industrialization was unlikely to have positive employment\nand income effects for the larger part of the rural population in the foreseeable\nfuture.  Hence,  direct  programs  of  support  to  the  rural  poor  were  deemed\nimportant by the development elite. Rural public works programs are one\nform of such support programs. Their rationale, within the elite development\ndiscourse, lies in the seasonal nature of demand for agricultural labor and the\nresultant lack of employment and income generation opportunities during\nthe lean agricultural season\u2014a problem aggravated by the paucity of alternative\nemployment options locally (for instance in rural industry). The problem is\nacute for the lowest rungs of rural society, who depend on daily (or weekly)\nsubsistence wages (as agricultural labor) and have no access to other income-\ngenerating assets. Rural public works programs during the lean season would\nboth  improve  rural  infrastructure  and  generate  wage  employment,  thus\nproviding income and consumption support.\n\nBut  how  would  such  programs  be  designed  and  how  would  they  be\nfinanced and governed? We must digress briefly and consider the structure of\nthe state bureaucratic apparatus in India and the historical debates surrounding\nthe architecture and distribution of power between the multiple tiers. At the\ntime of independence, India had an inherited colonial administrative setup.\nWhile the national and provincial governments were legitimized through a\ndemocratic process of electoral contests (through universal adult suffrage),\nthe local governments (in the rural areas in particular) were not democratized.\nThe autonomy of local governments was thwarted, and it was only in the\nearly 1990s that an amendment to the Constitution (the 73rd amendment)\nmandated the creation of the third tier of democratic government in India,\nthe  local  panchayat  system  in  rural  areas. The  panchayati  raj  institutions\nenvisaged  in  the  amendment  consisted  of  local  government  bodies  in  the\ndistricts (zilla parishad), blocks (block samiti), and villages (gram panchayat).3\nIn the wake of this legislative move, panchayat elections were held in Bihar in\n2001, for the first time in nearly 30 years. Local government in rural India has\ncontinued  to  be  viewed  as  an  arm  or  agency  of  superior  (higher)  tiers  of\ngovernment and has lacked autonomy and powers. Local government bodies\nlack  financial  resources4  (Rajaraman  2003,  Government  of  India  2000),\n\n3 There were 2,32,278 gram panchayats, 6022 block samitis, and 535 zilla parishads in India in March\n2003. Each gram panchayat had a population of around 3,000, with wide variation between provinces\n(Government of India 2003).\n\n4 Own resources raised by panchayats along with land revenue (which is levied by provincial governments\nbut is transferred to panchayats) were just around 10% of the total resource flow from the central\nGovernment  in  the  Sampoorna  Grameen  Rozgar  Yojana  (SGRY)  scheme  alone,  attesting  to  the\nstrangling fiscal dependence of local bodies on higher tiers of government.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n200\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fPower, Public Administration, and Poverty: Rural Employment Program in India\n\n201\n\ntaxation rights, and the power to decide on the utilization (and pricing) of\nlocal resources.\n\nWhile this centralized structure of the state apparatus was, in a sense,\nnatural for the colonial administration, with its driving desire to control from\na distance, the fact that the developmental regime, after independence, inherited\nthe same structure and retained the colonial legacy is somewhat strange. This\ndecision was not arrived at without debate and contest, however. At least two\nother alternatives and discourses in the country, even within the elite national\nleadership across the ideological spectrum, contested the proposal to set up a\nunitary  state  structure.  One  was  Gandhi\u2019s  proposal  for  strong  local  self-\ngovernment  (gram  swaraj)  and  his  radical  idea  of  power  flowing  from  the\nbottom\u2014the  village  governments  federating  into  provincial  and  national\ngovernments. The other was the draft of the Constitution for free India that\nM. N. Roy espoused, which envisaged the creation of networks of local people\u2019s\ncommittees in villages, towns, and cities to discharge the local functions of\ngovernment and to exercise control over the local bureaucracy. Within the\nGandhian vision, power over local resources in villages would have remained\nwithin the local government and the community. Higher tiers of state structure\nand civil society and large-scale industry organized around the federated power\nstructures would then have negotiated for access to rural resources. It is through\nthis process of dialogue that the village would have interacted with the city,\nand the city with the village, and in the process each would have known the\n\u201cother.\u201d Control and power over local resources would have enabled the local\n(rural) community and government to nurture a local discourse and create\nthe required strategic space to valorize local skills and resources. Several local\nand  regional  discourses  and  a  national  discourse  would  have  populated  a\ncompetitive discourse space. Imagination inspired by local discourse would\nhave  found  in  local  political  power  a  vehicle  for  action  to  shape  local\ndevelopment trajectories. The local (rural), provincial, and national tiers of\nstate  and  civil  society  organized  around  it  would  have  retained  their  own\nsalience,  but  their  appropriate  roles  would  have  been  discovered  through\ncontinuing  dialogue  (and  negotiations).  Public  administration  in  such  a\nframework would be part of a process of spatial competition as well.\n\nThe centralization discourse, however, won the debate (politically) around\nthe time that India attained independence, and the Constitution and structure\nof the state were designed accordingly. What is ironic is that the centralization\ndiscourse  found  support  from  even  radical  political  constituencies.  B.  R.\nAmbedkar, who represented the dalits (lower-caste people who are socially\nand economically marginalized), for instance, argued against the empowerment\nof village panchayats, for he feared that the landed gentry of the upper castes\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n201\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f202\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nwould invariably dominate the dalits and local government institutions would\nbe used to perpetuate the exploitation of lower-caste people and the poor (see\nBandyopadhyay, S. K. Ghosh, and B. Ghosh 2003). The modern state and its\nlocal representatives, the local administration, thus became powerful in the\nname of protecting the interests of the lowest sections of rural society from\nexploitation by the local elite. A centralized modern state structure was created\nwhere the local bodies were mere implementation agencies of rural development\nprograms of national or provincial governments. This centralized structure of\nthe state apparatus meant that rural development schemes would also have\nthat bias, in the distribution of rights to decision making between the various\ntiers  of  the  government.  More  importantly,  perhaps,  the  possibility  of\ncultivating a multiplicity of local discourses was short-circuited. For instance,\nstudies  on  rural  development  that  could  generate  local  discourse  (on\ndevelopment) would mostly be carried out or intermediated (and financed)\nby central agencies. Local discourse, to be voiced (and legitimized), would\nthen have to be elevated through an intermediary at a higher level.5 This would,\nhowever, reduce power around the local discourse and stifle it. The local (or\nrural) and the national, therefore, began to constitute two different contexts\nladen differentially with power. Power over the local (resources) was usurped\nby the national. Local (rural) development began to be defined and directed\nwithin a discourse of the development elite and actions of the developmental\nadministration (bureaucracy).\n\nSampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana\n\nOur inquiry and interpretation is organized around the rural employment\ngeneration scheme, Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana (SGRY).6 Funded\nand administered by the Ministry of Rural Development, it was the major\nsource of financial flows from the central Government to local government\nbodies for rural development activities.7 The scheme was launched in August\n2001  with  the  ambitious  target  of  generating  1  billion  person-days  of\nemployment  in  rural  areas  of  the  country  and  was  in  operation  till  2004.\n\n5 Our assignment, for instance, came from the central Government, though the geographic ambit of\nthe study was a small part of a province (our institute is located in a neighboring province). The\nterms of inquiry that defined the broad parameters of the study were set by the central agency. A\nquestion that came to us was why such studies and projects are not organized by local governments\n(say, panchayats) to give voice to and build up a local discourse.\n\n6 The rural employment scheme was launched under a new name in 2004, following a change in the\npolitical party in power in the central Government. The structure, however, remains largely unchanged.\n7 According to revised budgetary estimates for the ministry in 2002\u20132003, out of a total allocation of\n\nRs183.76 billion, almost Rs90 billion was set aside for SGRY (Government of India 2003).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n202\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fPower, Public Administration, and Poverty: Rural Employment Program in India\n\n203\n\nMore than half of the allocation was in the form of food grains (5 million\nmetric tons of grains\u2014rice and wheat\u2014worth Rs50 billion) to be supplied\nfrom  the  stocks  of  the  Food  Corporation  of  India,  the  parastatal  agency\nresponsible for the procurement and distribution of food grains through the\npublic distribution system. SGRY was implemented by the three-tier panchayat\nbodies with resources they shared between them. Yet, after 2 years of operation\nof the scheme, there were a few disturbing observations. Allocated resources,\nparticularly grains, were not utilized fully. This was one of our main points of\ninquiry. As a senior bureaucrat in the Ministry of Rural Development put it:\n\nThere are many problems in the implementation of the scheme, particularly\nwith the local governments. They are inept. They are not able to utilize the\nresources provided. The Ministry is very prompt in releasing funds, if the\nreports from the implementing agencies are in order.\n\nBut why were reports not in order, we wondered.\n\nThe Management Control System\n\nWe first look into the broad contours of management control systems\nused for monitoring at different levels of the scheme. The chart in Appendix\n2 captures the different agencies involved\u2014the flow of funds and the generation\nand flow of information. \u201cHard\u201d information, or firm figures, is differentiated\nfrom \u201csoft\u201d information, which is more in the nature of estimates often arrived\nat by rule of thumb.\n\nThe Ministry of Rural Development was at the apex of the control system\nand was the principal source of funds for the program. Funds and food grains\nwere allocated every year to each district on the basis of identified parameters\nof backwardness of the district like population below the official poverty income\nlevel and population of marginalized castes and tribes. The release of funds,\nhowever, depended on the submission of reports (and, hence, data) to the\nministry and past utilization of the allocated resources. Funds were released\ndirectly to the District Rural Development Agency (DRDA), which disbursed\nthem to the implementing panchayati raj bodies on the basis of project plans.\n\nCentral Government Guidelines: Labor Intensity\n\nThe flow of funds from the central Government to local panchayat bodies\nwas accompanied by a set of conditions that the implementing agencies had\nto comply with. Although there were several such guidelines, we discuss only\none of them. It is around this guideline (norm) and the deviation from it that\nwe organize our attempt at interpretation. The scheme was envisaged primarily\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n203\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f204\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nas a wage employment generation program that would also create durable\nrural infrastructure and public assets. Given the very nature of the scheme,\ntherefore, it tried to reach the lowest rungs of rural society, where the demand\nfor wage employment is high. Hence, the guidelines emphasized labor-intensive\nworks.  Although  no  indicative  or  normative  wage-to-material  ratio  was\nspecified  for  works  in  the  scheme,  the  implicit  wage-to-material  ratio  was\nquite high, given the allocation pattern of funds and food grains in the program.\nWhen the scheme was started, the annual fund allocation for the scheme\nwas around Rs50 billion, while the food grain allocation was around 5 million\nmetric tons. At least 5 kg of grains was to be provided per person-day, and the\nrest of the minimum wage (Rs58 per day in Bihar) was to be paid in cash. An\nadditional stipulation was that 25% of the minimum wage had to be paid in\ncash. Given the ratio of cash and food grain allocation and other stipulations\n(along  with  the  valuation  norms  adopted  in  Bihar,  i.e.,  Rs5.67  per  kg  for\nrice), the implicit wage-nonwage ratio for works in the scheme came to around\n3:1 for equal utilization of both the funds and food grain components of the\nallocation.8\n\nThis implicit ratio, moreover, was binding in the sense that non-adherence\nhad costs for the local government bodies implementing the scheme. If the\nutilization of the allotted food grain is low, as would be a natural outcome of\ntaking  up  works  with  a  higher  nonwage  or  material  component,  a  lower\nallotment of food grains would be made the next year and there would be a\npro-rata  reduction  in  the  fund  allocation.9 The  fund  (cash)  allocation  was\nfungible  (it  could  be  used  for  the  cash  component  of  wages  or  spent  on\nmaterials), while the allocation of grains could be used only to pay for wages,\nunless (illegal) diversion was allowed (i.e., selling the allocated grain in the\nopen market and using the cash realized to procure materials). Since the local\ngovernment bodies were almost totally dependent on the funds flow from the\n\n8\n\nSuppose Bihar were to receive Rs10X million in funds and X/1,000 million metric tons of food\ngrains (fund and food grains being divided among states on the same pro-rata basis), with the value\nof the grains being around Rs6X million. At the beneficiary level, if rice were valued at Rs5.67 (plus\n4% sales tax and 1% market tax in some districts), this would mean that around half of the wage\ncompensation would be in the form of grains, so that, along with Rs6X million worth of grain, an\nequal amount of funds would be required to pay the cash wage. So, Rs12X million out of the Rs16X\nmillion  (of  the  total  fund  and  grain  allocation)  would  be  the  wage  component,  giving  a  wage-\nmaterial ratio of 3:1.\n\n9 The central allocation in the scheme was released in two installments each year. The second installment\nwas released if 60% of available funds that year (including unused funds from the previous year and\nthe current year\u2019s first installment) was used. In addition, 75% of the first installment of food grain\nallocation had to be taken up and 60% of the grain taken up (along with the balance) had to be\ndistributed. Otherwise, the allocation of grains was reduced and, along with that, the fund allocation\nwas reduced proportionately as well.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n204\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fPower, Public Administration, and Poverty: Rural Employment Program in India\n\n205\n\ncentral Government to carry out local development activities (as was their\nmandate), the guideline created incentives forcing local implementing agencies\nto follow the implicit wage-nonwage ratio while selecting works in the scheme.\nIn this sense, the guideline for labor-intensive works was an important control\nmeasure as well. It was a norm, a rule, in the action domain of those responsible\nfor planning and executing the scheme in the ministry.\n\nDeviation and Its Interpretation\n\nHowever, our analysis of projects taken up in the four districts we visited\nshowed that the labor intensity (wage-nonwage ratio) of projects taken up under\nthe scheme should have been far lower than the implicit norms. We analyzed in\ndetail projects taken up in the scheme in all four districts from the consolidated\nlist available at the DRDA office. Here, we present information on Bhojpur\ndistrict  only,  since  the  patterns  were  quite  similar  across  the  four  districts.10\nBroadly speaking, most projects taken up in the scheme involved around 10\u2013\n15% of project expense as wage payment. Thus, from an analysis of the project\nlist, it appears that the wage-nonwage ratio should have been far lower than the\nimplicit ratio envisaged in the scheme. The norm or rule for taking up labor-\nintensive projects under the scheme was thus violated in implementation. The\nnorm failed in action. The deviation now needs to be interpreted.\n\nLow food grain utilization is understandable, for grains are not fungible\n(unlike  cash)  and  had  to  be  used  to  pay  wages  alone.  While  the  local\nimplementing and monitoring agencies, i.e., the elected local bodies and the\n\n10 Around 500 projects were implemented through the block samithi and around 100 projects through\nthe zilla parishad between 2001 and 2003. The projects included (roughly in order of their importance\nin terms of number of projects taken up) the construction of rural link roads (mud roads with brick\nsoling), school buildings and community halls (usually the addition of a room or two in existing\nstructures), concrete local drainage systems, concrete culverts and pools, concrete sheds (chabutra),\npucca houses (awas), and mud roads (kuccha), as well as the cleaning and deepening of ponds or\nother water storage structures. Except for the last two types of projects, these projects were primarily\nmaterial-  or  capital-intensive.  Most  of  the  projects  were,  moreover,  small  (in  terms  of  cost)  and\ninvolved only temporary employment generation for short periods (maybe a month).\n\nThe independent estimates of engineers showed that the labor (wage) component of these projects\ncould  not  have  been  more  than  10\u201315%  (given  the  construction  technology  that  was  normally\nadopted). In most cases it should have been even lower. The construction of kuccha roads and the\ncleaning and deepening of water storage structures are more labor-intensive projects (50\u201370% of\ncost would be on wages). However, the share of these types of projects was very small. Out of 500\nschemes at the block samithi level, we could locate only 35 kuccha road construction projects (those\nthat did not have the phrase \u201cbrick-soling\u201c in the project title), and around 20 pond-cleaning or\npond-deepening projects. These projects, moreover, cost less. The average project cost estimate of\nthe  35  katcha  road  projects  was  around  Rs35,000,  while  the  average  estimate  of  all  projects  put\ntogether  was  roughly  around  Rs120,000.  It  would  be  safe  to  say  that  the  expenditure  on  labor-\nintensive projects was even less than 5% of the total approved expenditure in projects at the block\nsamithi level. The calculations for zilla parishad projects were similar.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n205\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f206\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nbureaucrats in the districts and blocks, could be reprimanded for not adhering\nto  the  norms  (and  non-adherence  could  also  be  interpreted  as  a  failure  to\ndischarge their duties), in our opinion this deviation was a reflection of deeper\nconflicts that need to be understood. Interestingly, guidelines for the scheme\nalso indicated that the selection of works should be participatory and projects\nthat satisfied felt needs of the local community should be taken up by local\nbodies. The  local  community,  however,  is  not  homogeneous  in  economic,\nsocial, or political power. While labor-intensive works create more employment\noptions  (per  rupee  of  total  expenditure)  for  the  lowest  strata,  particularly\nlandless laborers, the rural elite may be more interested in taking up more\nmaterial- or capital-intensive development works that make roads passable, or\ncreate other public assets that can be leveraged. What is a felt need of the rural\ncommunity then and how does it find expression?\n\nThis deviation from the norms needs to be interpreted. We inquired\ndeeper into the records (documentation; referred to locally as the measurement\nbook, or MB) of a few sample works (or projects). Most projects showed a\nfairly high wage-material ratio, consistent with the implicit wage ratio (that\nwe  discussed  earlier),  and  a  large  roster  of  laborers  who  were  employed\ntemporarily in projects taken up under the scheme. The authenticity of the\ndocumentation process and the data generated therein was therefore suspect.\nWe discuss this issue in greater detail when we look more closely into the local\nmonitoring  arrangements\u2014the  relation  between  local  bureaucrats,  elected\nrepresentatives of local bodies, and the rural poor.\n\nWe posed this problem of the material-intensive nature of most projects\n(the local debate was couched in terms of kuccha and  pucca works) to the\nlaborers whom we met (and who had worked in the projects), the local elite\n(the elected representatives), and the local bureaucrats (the regulators). These\nresponses were typical:\n\nWe plan projects that have a wage-material ratio of around 2:1, so that a\nlot  of  employment  is  generated.  We  want  the  scheme  to  allocate  more\nfunds and less grains. We require more funds to carry out development\n(pucca) works. (Elected representative - gram pradhan)\n\nWe want more employment opportunities. More projects will help us. We\nwant more roads to be built in the village. They increase connectivity, help\nall of us. (Wage laborer)\n\nPucca  works  are  much  better  since  they  create  durable  assets  that  the\ncommunity as a whole benefits from. Though kuccha works generate more\nemployment in the short run, they are also prone to greater leakages (and\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n206\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fPower, Public Administration, and Poverty: Rural Employment Program in India\n\n207\n\nmisappropriation of funds) and are far more difficult to monitor. (Local\nbureaucrat)\n\nWe interpret the responses as evidence of agreement across classes (at the\nlocal level) on the need for material-intensive works, such as all-weather roads\nwithin the rural milieu.11 The reason for such preference, however, varies: the\nbureaucrat  wants  easier  monitoring  ability,12  the  wage  laborer  wants  more\nemployment,  and  the  elected  representatives  want  more  development.\nAlthough more labor-intensive works would benefit wage laborers much more,\nneither panchayat  members  nor  even  wage  laborers  expressed  the  need  for\nmore labor-intensive works. This is not to say, however, that no scope for such\nprojects  exists.  The  possibility  of  such  projects  has  simply  not  yet  been\ndiscovered or articulated in the local discourse.\n\nThe responses of different groups also reveal their place in the overall\npower  structure. The  elected  representative,  as  the  person  responsible  for\nimplementing the project (and adhering to norms), has to demonstrate that\nnorms are being followed and documents are maintained, and that is important\nbecause well-maintained documents and timely reports bring in fresh resources\n(the next year\u2019s allocation). The demand for more funds, rather than grains, is\na  cautious  demand  for  more  material-intensive  works,  while  giving  the\nimpression (or a signal) that norms are being followed. The local discourse\narguing for more material-intensive projects fails to contest the norm or the\nknowledge claim that drove the formulation of the norm. This local discourse\nlacks legitimacy at the national level. A gram pradhan (head of a gram panchayat)\nwe met, however, was much more forthright. He said:\n\nAll elected representatives have to deviate from the norms of the scheme,\nbecause otherwise you cannot carry out any development work. So, breaking\nthe rule is commonplace, but local villagers know who is honest and breaks\nrules to carry out work in a proper way and who is dishonest and breaks it\nto derive private benefits.\n\n11\n\nIn Bhatwara gram panchayat of Korha block in Katihar district, the construction of brick-soled 10-\nfoot-wide roads in the village connecting fields inside the village with the highway made the village\nmore accessible. Banana is a major plantation crop in the village, and it is also exported outside the\nstate, and the road links helped villagers ease supply constraints, since trucks could enter the village\ndirectly. The  demand  for  these  roads,  moreover,  was  a  long-standing  issue  and  the  villagers  had\npleaded  with  the  Members  of  the  Legislative  Assembly/Members  of  Parliament  (MLA/MP)  (the\nelected representative to the provincial and federal legislature) of the region for money for the project\nfor a long time (without much effect).\n\n12 For  example,  kuccha  works  easily  get  washed  away  during  heavy  rains  and  floods,  which  are\n\ncommonplace in Bihar.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n207\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f208\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nThe context matters: local and national are separate. The credibility and\nhonesty of village leaders, built up over long periods of interaction within a\nsmall  community,  were  not  easily  observable  to  us  as  outsiders  (visiting\nresearchers). The documents or the records, however, were far more intelligible\nor understandable to us (and the bureaucrats at the national level)\u2014but do\nthese provide relevant information for judging?13 Documented information\nlooks  at  all  deviation  from  norms  in  the  same  light. The  honest  and  the\ndishonest, so easily distinguishable within the information-rich local context,\nappear quite similar to a distant observer (like a bureaucrat at the national\nlevel) using the documented information. In a way, it fails to reveal the strategic\nintent  of  the  actors\u2014the  rural  leaders  in  this  case.  Context  has  a  spatial,\ngeographic sense. The local and the national, therefore, differ.\n\nThe point to be made, however, is that projects were selected through\nthe gram panchayat or other elected representative local bodies and were in\nthat  sense  an  expression  of  revealed  felt  needs  of  the  heterogeneous  rural\ncommunity, but those revealed felt needs, in many cases, might be weighed\nmore toward the interests of more powerful sections of rural society. Although\nthe guideline specified that \u201cfelt need\u201d works should be taken up, the stringent\ncondition regarding the required labor intensity of the works actually gave\nshort shrift to the expression of community needs. Deviation from the norms\ntherefore  became  the  norm  in  action  within  the  local  context.  Was  this\nlegitimate? Within the structure of the scheme, clearly it was not. However,\nwithin the local context the answer does not come so easily. The rural areas we\nvisited lacked all-weather passable roads and many other civic amenities (or\npublic assets) that are common within an urban milieu and are often a symbol\nof development so that a lack of those amenities is perceived as backwardness.\nThe rural elite therefore strives to overcome this lack of development\u2014and to\ndevelop\u2014for the rural elite is also most closely linked (among rural classes)\nwith  the  urban  milieu  and  also  probably  aspires  most  for  urban-centered\nupward mobility. The local, probably, no longer has an autonomous discourse\non development. The symbols of development that are imagined are borrowed\nfrom the urban-centered discourse, and those images are powerful, as they\nassert themselves through their absence in the local (rural) milieu. Dreams\n(within the local) are framed in icons and motifs borrowed from the national.\n\n13\n\nIn Rampur Urf Rahimpur gram panchayat in Parwatta block of Khagaria district the construction of\na chabutra was one of the works in our sample. Although the muster roll for the work showed several\nperson-days of employment generation, the panchayat pramukh (who was widely known to be a very\nhonest and active person) was quite forthright in telling us that only five persons were involved in\nthe construction. All of them were semiskilled workers\u2014masons from outside the village. According\nto him, the gram sevak maintained the muster rolls; these were not his concern.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n208\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fPower, Public Administration, and Poverty: Rural Employment Program in India\n\n209\n\nIn the discourse space, the separation between \u201clocal\u201d and \u201cnational\u201d blurs.\nThe discourse space, in other words, lacks contesting claimants.\n\nMonitoring Systems and Agencies\n\nWe now shift to the actionable domain again, where deviation from the\n(rules  of  the)  scheme  was  commonplace.  It  is  important,  therefore,  to\nunderstand  the  monitoring  systems  and  agencies  involved  in  the\nimplementation of SGRY\u2014to find how they interfaced with each other, how\nthey engaged in conflicts, how norms were subverted, and how the conceptual\nand actionable knowledge domains were reconciled. In our schema, this is\nmost important, for it is the site of action, of implementation, and of the\nperceived failure in implementation and governance. It provides the window\nfor looking into the \u201cfolk world\u201d of the local in action.\n\nAs Appendix 2 shows, there were two stages in the monitoring process:\na pre-project (approval) stage and a post-project stage of ensuring compliance\nwith documentation requirements, which affected the flow of resources in\nlater periods. Two sets of agencies were involved in the implementation: the\nelected local bodies and the district and block administration. The roles of\nthe  two  sets  of  agencies  were  quite  different  within  the  implementation\nmechanism of the scheme. While the elected bodies were responsible for\nselecting the works to be undertaken and for implementing the projects,\nthe  administration  gave  technical  as  well  as  administrative  (pre-project)\napproval, including approval of project cost estimates. The administration\nwas  also  responsible  for  post-implementation  monitoring,  i.e.,  the\ndocumentation  of  proper  records  (the  muster  rolls  of  laborers  and  the\nmeasurement book) and post-project inspection to ensure that the project\nhad been carried out satisfactorily.\n\nThe local administration, along with the elected representatives of local\ngovernment bodies, in a sense, represents the local elite\u2014located between\nthe national (or higher tiers of the state apparatus) and the rural commoner,\nincluding the wage laborer around whom the scheme was conceived. It is\nthrough this local elite that the rural commoner often connects with the\nnational. The local elite plays the important role of information intermediary.\nThe lifeworlds of the two segments of the local elite are different, however.\nThe local political class acquired power and position through a local electoral\ncontest, and the cultivation of a local following among the rural commoner\nwould be an important part of its strategic world. It therefore has to look\ninward to the local. However, it would also aspire to upward mobility within\nthe political party\u2014moving to positions of provincial and national leadership\nand other such important organizational roles. And this would normally set\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n209\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f210\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nup  complex  dynamics  and  multiple  strategic  possibilities.  While  the  local\npolitical leaders would try to leverage their local support base to achieve upward\nmobility within their own organizations, they would also try to draw support\nand resources into the local community, to the extent that this ability to bring\nresources determines the outcome of local political contests and their continued\nsurvival in positions of power. This ability to mobilize the local population\n(in an electoral context) and link it to larger (national or regional) political\nprocesses (and parties) gives the local political class its power, albeit only as an\nagent mobilizer, to negotiate with higher tiers of political leadership or the\nbureaucracy in the actionable domain.\n\nThe  position  of  the  local  administration  is  slightly  different.  Local\nadministrators  belong  to  either  national  or  provincial  cadres  of  the  state\nbureaucratic apparatus. Broadly speaking, their role is to act as agents of the\nhigher tiers of government in the local government, to ensure, in a way, that\nresources (provided by the higher tiers of government for local development)\nare used and schemes implemented according to the norms (and rules). The\ncareer path of the administrators is up the administrative hierarchy to provincial\nor national administrative roles, for the local (rural) administrative positions\nare at the lowest rungs of the bureaucratic hierarchy. For the purpose of this\npaper, two observations stand out. First, the elected political class is structurally\nmore linked to the rural commoner, for cultivating a following within the\nlocal community is strategically important to the continued survival of this\nclass. Its members are locked into the rural milieu more strongly and would\ntherefore have a greater incentive to articulate the local community interest\neven if that means negotiating a deviation from the norms (or rules) set by the\nhigher-tier bureaucracy. This places the rural commoner in a strange position.\nThe rural commoner might, in fact, share the lifeworld and context of the\nlocal political class (often the local oppressors) and the administrative world\nof rules, norms, and schemes would be far from its lifeworld. An incident we\nwitnessed brings this out quite eloquently.\n\nA rural commoner came to meet a block development officer (BDO)\nwhile we were in the latter\u2019s office, to get his signature (of attestation) on an\napplication. We reproduce the dialogue below.\n\nRural commoner: Saab (Sir), can I get your signature on my photo?\n\nBDO: Has the gram pradhan (head of the village panchayat) signed it?\n\nRural commoner: He said that your signature would be enough.\n\nBDO: Whose photo is this? Go and get the  pradhan\u2019s signature on the\nreverse side of the photo.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n210\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fPower, Public Administration, and Poverty: Rural Employment Program in India\n\n211\n\nThe BDO gave a cursory glance at the application form and the photo\nand threw it away, castigating the rural commoner for his foolishness. We\nmanaged to take a peek at the photograph. Clearly it was that person\u2019s photo,\nbut it had been taken some years (maybe 5 years) back so that he looked just\na bit different. That was an instance of power revealed. The gram pradhan is\nmuch  closer,  perhaps,  to  the  world  of  the  rural  commoner.  Probably,  the\npradhan will also tell him a few things, give him some advice. He will probably\nalso use his services for this favor (if this is indeed a favor). But the point is\nthat the rural commoner can at least get into an alliance with the pradhan,\nuneven though the terms of that alliance may be.\n\nThe administration, on the other hand, is a sort of guardian of the norms\nand  yet  it  has  to  strike  alliances  with  the  local  community,  often  local\ncommunity leaders, to act, enmeshed as it is within the local political economy.\nIn the course of our interaction with elected representatives and administrative\nofficials,  it  was  clear  that  the  relation  between  the  two  arms  of  the  local\ngovernment machinery has not been too smooth.14 This conflict is important\nto  us  since  it  defines  the  nature  of  local  alliances  and  negotiations  that\naccompany the murky process of implementation of SGRY. To some of the\ndetails of that process we now turn.\n\nThe primary source of data (documentation) about projects in the scheme\nwas  the  MB.  It  contained  details  of  all  approvals  related  to  the  projects\n(including  the  technical  approval  provided  by  the  engineering  staff  in  the\nlocal administration), and an account of expenses on materials purchased as\nwell as on wages paid to laborers. A muster roll of laborers who worked in the\nproject was also maintained along with the MB. While material expenses were\npaid through the bank, providing traceability to the transactions, those who\nworked were paid their daily or weekly wages in cash, usually at the work site.\nThe authenticity of wage payment transactions was far more difficult to verify\nsince  they  did  not  leave  a  trace.  The  random  sample  of  (around  50)\nmeasurement books that we studied in detail had well-documented records.\nWages made up more than 50% of the total project cost on average. This was,\nas  we  argued  earlier,  an  overestimate,  since  most  of  the  projects  were\nmaterial-intensive. We felt that the wage component of the project was inflated\n\n14 The  last  panchayat  elections  in  Bihar  were  held  in  the  late  1970s,  after  which  the  same  elected\nrepresentatives  continued  to  hold  office.  After  the  73rd  amendment  and  the  drive  to  strengthen\nlocal governments in the early 1990s, the old panchayat bodies were dismantled in the mid-1990s.\nElections,  however,  were  held  only  in  2001.  In  the  interval,  full  powers  were  shifted  to  the\nadministrative wing. As a gram pradhan put it, \u201cthat period was the golden period for many local-\nlevel administrative officials in Bihar.\u201d After the panchayat elections, therefore, the elected bodies\nhad to reclaim their powers. In Khagaria district, for instance, the zilla parishad members claimed\nthat they had no access to records pertaining to zilla parishad works till August 2002.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n211\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f212\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nand,  since  wage  payments  were  in  cash  (with  the  associated  problem  of\nverifiability), the data might not have been too difficult to falsify.15 What is of\nconcern, however, is the fact that the employment generation figures available\nat the provincial and national level, which were aggregated from local data,\nare gross overestimates.16 Yet these data, published in government publications,\nare often used by researchers, oblivious to issues of their authenticity.\n\nBut how is this data fudging allowed? The need to tamper with data arises\npartly from the diverging interests of the implementers (the local political class),\nwhose revealed felt needs are biased toward material-intensive projects, while\nthe norms of the project as determined by the central Government are different.\nThe local elite, therefore, must seek and negotiate a deviation from the rules,\npaving the way for a local exchange between the administration (the local guardian\nof the rules) and the local political class. Extralegal rents are generated, leading\nto leakage of resources. Project costs are inflated17 and these extra expenses are\nprobably represented in documents as inflated expenses on wages as well. In\nareas  we  visited,  anecdotal  stories  of  (extralegal)  commissions  extracted  by\npersonnel in local administration for approving projects were widespread. The\ncommoner around the administrative offices often provided those anecdotes.18\nThe  commissions  (or  \u201ccuts,\u201d  as  they  were  called)  are  standardized. The\norganization of the local exchange and the informal rules that organize the local\nexchange around deviation (from norms) are therefore very important for action\nand implementation of the projects. It is only when the informal rules are under\ncontest that conflicts break out. Our feeling was that well-governed areas had a\nstable pattern of these local exchanges that made the process of implementation\neffective. Several respondents shared this feeling. The forging of successful local\nalliances therefore constitutes the cornerstone of implementation and action.\n\n15 We tried cross-checking with random samples of laborers listed in the muster rolls, but that did not\nprove too effective. To reach the village commoner, we often had to rely on the support of the local\nleaders. In many cases we were told that a particular person had gone out to work and we had no way\nto verify the claim. The roving sociologist\u2019s methods are not quite adequate.\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\nIn one district DRDA office, staff responsible for sending annual reports to the central Government\nwere  using  the  rule  of  thumb  (derived  from  the  norms  of  the  scheme)  to  arrive  at  the  figure  of\nemployment generated at the district level. The lower bodies, blocks and panchayats, do not send in\ndata on employment generated in that district.\n\nIn spite of detailed monitoring, including technical and administrative approval of cost estimates for\neach project, there was general agreement that cost inflation is fairly widespread. In a brick-soled\nmud road construction project undertaken by Korha block samithi (in Katihar district) in Binodpur\npanchayat in 2001\u20132002 (scheme no. 4), a cost estimate of Rupees 5,51,400 was approved for the\nconstruction of a 3,000-foot-long and 8-foot-wide road. According to independent estimates, the\ncost  per  100  feet  of  brick-soled  road  would  be  around  Rs11,000\u201312,000. This  implies  that  the\napproved project cost was inflated by more than 50%.\n\nIn East Champaran district, zilla parishad members claimed that the district engineer was available\nonly one day a week and his signature was therefore very difficult and costly to obtain.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n212\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fPower, Public Administration, and Poverty: Rural Employment Program in India\n\n213\n\nInterpreting Multiple Contexts; Conflicts and Their Resolution\n\nWe reproduce snippets of our conversation with the district magistrates\n\nin the course of our interviews.\n\nPoverty alleviation programs like SGRY have degenerated into a patronage\ndispensation mechanism for the political class. The primacy of generation\nof wage employment, which is the spirit of the scheme, has never been\ninternalized by the local bodies....\n\nThe central Government fixes too many rules, wants too many monitoring\nand conformance reports. The district administration hardly has any powers\nto act in an entrepreneurial way....\n\nSchemes like SGRY have a lot of problems. Nowadays these people do not\neven inform me about what is happening.\n\nThese snippets represent various faces of the local administration: a sense\nof disgust at the local political elites\u2019 hijacking of the scheme for their own\nstrategic benefits, thwarting the intent of the central Government in extending\nbenefits to the rural commoner; a sense of being constrained by too many\ncentralized rules to act locally; and a sense of loss of control and a failure of\ngovernance that must exist since the informal local (illegal) exchanges that\nform the concrete basis of action undermine the administrative heritage. The\nconflicting faces exist simultaneously. Yet, is it not legitimate for the local\npolitical  elite  to  cultivate  their  support  base  within  the  community  using\npatronage dispensation as a tool, so as to succeed in the local electoral contests?\nWhy  does  this  strategic  imperative  have  to  take  the  form  of  a  failure  of\ngovernance? Can\u2019t the strategic imperative of the local political elite be tapped\nfor governance? Imaginative strategy making is precisely about tapping this\ndifference  for  governance.  The  differing  strategic  imperatives  may  not\nnecessarily be a path to anarchy.\n\nAs we moved through the process of design and implementation of the\nscheme,  we  encountered  multiple  lifeworlds  and  contexts  that  generated\ndifferent knowledge claims. We alluded to differences in contexts at multiple\nlevels.  The  national  and  the  local  are  spatially  separated  contexts  laden\ndifferentially with power, and this separation leads to differences in incentives\nto act in the domain of action. Within the local context, the local administrator\n(bureaucrat),  the  political  elite,  and  the  rural  commoner  are  placed\ndifferentially, especially with regard to how they are linked (or not linked) to\nhigher tiers of the bureaucratic or political setup. Another level of contextual\ndifference is thus defined. The actors in the multiple local contexts, however,\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n213\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f214\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nshare the locale in space and time, with the rural commoner being tied most\ntightly and the bureaucrat most weakly to the local. These contextual differences\nbetween actors lead to different incentives and differences in how they perceive\nthe scheme under discussion and how they act.\n\nImplementation (or action) requires, however, an alliance between different\nlocal actors. The local political elite utilizes resources obtained through the scheme\nto realize local development objectives framed in an urban-centered discourse\n(with development images and icons that are borrowed from the urban milieu),\nwhile  at  the  same  time  cultivating  a  local  following  through  patronage\ndispensation that can be leveraged both in local electoral contests as well as in\nnegotiation with higher tiers of the political establishment. And the rural poor\u2014\nthe commoner\u2014also participates, for this alliance, which provides favored access\nto wage employment during periods of crisis (the non-cultivating season), is\nextremely essential for survival.19 For the local administration, documentation\nis the most important aspect, as it ensures a continued resource flow. It also\nensures that the role of the local administration as guardian of the norms is\nfulfilled\u2014at least when it comes to documented records, which are visible and\nmake sense to those far removed from the place where those documents were\ngenerated. Each actor therefore understands the other, and it is through this\nunderstanding that the alliance can be forged and action can proceed. Multiple\ncontexts, therefore, negotiate at the interface. The task of understanding the\nother, which is often a cornerstone of strategizing, is accomplished in the domain\nof action. The alliance, however, is forged on a deviation from the norm set by\nthe central bureaucracy. The knowledge generated in the actionable domain\nand the reaching out to other contexts that occurs in the process have a somewhat\ntragic dimension. This knowledge claim, based on a deviation (and often on\nillegal deals) can hardly be celebrated, for it is macabre: it is a knowledge claim\nthat is not, and probably cannot, be voiced. While we have looked into actors in\nthe local context so far, the question as to why the national tolerates or how it\nreconciles this deviation remains. So we turn next to the national.\n\nThe central Government looks at poverty as a problem to be tackled,\npartly through wage employment. The elite development discourse recognizes\na need to provide consumption support to the lowest rungs of rural society.\nThis recognition is often couched in terms of a right to food or employment.\nAnd a neoclassic choice of technique argument would clearly be looking at\ncreating labor-intensive assets in the rural milieu, since that would use the\n\n19 The total budgeted amount for SGRY amounted to around Rs0.2 million per gram panchayat per\nyear  and  an  equal  amount  of  grain.  Given  reasonable  estimates  of  leakages  (30%)  and  a  wage\ncomponent of 20% (at a daily wage of Rs60), employment generation would be around 500\u20131,000\nperson-days a year in a gram panchayat with average population of around 3,000.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n214\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fPower, Public Administration, and Poverty: Rural Employment Program in India\n\n215\n\nmost abundant factor of production. The conceptual knowledge claim therefore\npropounds the relevance of the types of schemes we are discussing. In the\nactionable domain it leads to the norms. However, the design of such a scheme\nmust first enter the budgetary allocation process for the central Government.\nConcerns in the actionable domain are raised in this allocation decision, where\nthe scheme has to compete with other uses of financial (budgetary) resources.\nThe  cost  of  generating  employment  becomes  an  important  parameter  of\ndecision  making.  A  labor-intensive  works  program  not  only  benefits  wage\nlaborers more, it also reduces the financial cost (for the central Government)\nof providing a unit (rupee) of wage income in rural areas. Substantial wage\nemployment opportunities can then be created at a realistic cost to the central\nGovernment.20 The implementation and monitoring of the scheme then focus\non the utilization of funds and resources and on proper documentation. The\nnorms  flowing  from  the  conceptual  domain  therefore  find  expression  in\nsatisfying the pragmatic pressures created in the budgetary allocation process.\nThe actionable domain, within what we are calling the \u201cnational context,\u201d\nfinds  the  conceptual  claim  pragmatic. The  actionable  domain  has  other\nconcerns as well. The local and the national are linked in the political sphere.\nWe argued that the local political elite is often the agent mobilizer. It is this\npower that enables the local political elite to negotiate around deviations at\nthe local level. The scheme thus acts as a patronage dispensation mechanism,\nnot only at the local level but also probably at the interface of the national and\nthe local. It serves the important purpose of political mobilization in electoral\ncontests. Within the actionable domain, therefore, the local and the national\ndo interact across contexts. Yet there is a certain sense of tragedy.\n\nThe knowledge generated in the actionable domain through negotiation\nat the interface of contexts is rich and valuable. It is on such knowledge that\nthe  system  functions  and  action  occurs. Yet  this  knowledge  also  bears  the\ntragedy of the macabre. It fails to revise the conceptual knowledge claims. It\nalso fails to find expression in a discourse that inspires\u2014a discourse where\nalliances can be struck on celebration, instead of deviation. This, we argue, is\nbecause of lack of power of the local in two different senses of the term. The\nlocal, as we argued, lacks power over the material domain\u2014importantly over\nseveral local resources\u2014and must perforce depend on a stream of grants. The\nlocal also lacks an autonomous discourse that could have lent a voice to local\nconcerns. The local dreams in borrowed motifs and images. The local elite\n\n20 Several studies have tried to compare different programs on the basis of the cost of generation of\nemployment.

It is this failure to nurture a local\ndiscourse, to counter and contest the national discourse (or even the universal\ndiscourse, as in development science) that is a more important aspect of the\nlack of local power. Power has many shades, and in important ways the local\nlacks power. Even the power of the local political elite has a certain sense of\nfutility. It is the power of a mere agent mobilizer, a power that can hardly lead\nto imaginative flights of conceptualization or strategizing.\n\nThe context therefore matters. In the domain of action, actors within\nconflicting contexts negotiate, quite effectively, to arrive at a common ground\nfor  action,  even  though  they  are  all  enmeshed  in  their  local  contexts.\nNegotiation occurs at the interface of contexts. The other is discovered. The\nnegotiation  is  subversive  yet  that  is  what  leads  to  action.  In  this  macabre\nsubversion, we interpret an existential assertion of the disempowered other\nworld of folk life. It is the moment of freedom. Yet it cannot lead to a flight of\nfancy. It has to contort, distort, and convolute within itself. Such is the tragedy.\nThe national elite discourse, however, continues. It does not have a contestant\n(from  the  local)  in  the  discourse  space\u2014universalism  continues  to  be\ncelebrated. The norm and its deviation exist simultaneously. But the norm is\nnot redefined and renegotiated. The other can be blamed for the deviation\nand the norm can be rationalized. The dominant knowledge claim can then\nreconcile to an implementation and governance failure and engage in a fruitless\nsearch for better administrative processes.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis paper was an interpretational journey through the implementation\nof the wage employment generation program (SGRY) designed and sponsored\nby the central Government in India. The scheme was designed to provide\nwage employment support to the lowest strata of rural society during the lean\nagricultural  season,  when  demand  for  wage  labor  from  other  normal\n(agriculture-linked) rural economic activities is at its lowest, by taking up a\nprogram of rural public asset and infrastructure construction. The design of\nthe  program,  in  terms  of  norms  and  rules  that  governed  implementation,\nflowed out of a knowledge claim\u2014a perception about the rural reality shared\nby those who designed the program at the level of the central Government.\nThe paper took up a few such norms as defined within the structure of the\nscheme and looked into how they were interpreted and often breached at the\nlevel of implementation\u2014on the field of action by agencies responsible for\nimplementation.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n216\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fPower, Public Administration, and Poverty: Rural Employment Program in India\n\n217\n\nIt is common to explain such phenomenon as cases of implementation\nfailure, to be tackled by tightening systems. But we argued that there is no\nsuch thing as an implementation failure. Central to this argument is the claim\nthat context and the lifeworld of actors and agencies placed at different tiers\nof the system differ. The planners in the Ministry of Rural Development, the\nlocal administration in the blocks and districts, the local political class that\nmakes up the elected representatives of panchayat bodies implementing the\nprojects, and the wage laborer (or the rural commoner)\u2014these agents dwell\nin different worlds. Their strategic imperatives differ. The multiple contexts\nand the agents implicated therein must therefore negotiate, particularly at the\ninterface of contexts. In the actionable domain this negotiation occurs, but\nthe negotiation is organized around deviation from the norms. The norm fails\nto hold in implementation, in the \u201cfolk world.\u201d\n\nYet the norm and its deviation continue to exist in simultaneity. The\nknowledge claim of this other can exist only as a stealthy subversion. This\nsubversion is an expression of a lack of harmony. The knowledge claim derived\nfrom the folk world of action fails to negotiate with and redefine the dominant\nconceptual  claim  because  the  folk  world  lacks  the  power  to  negotiate  and\nengage in strategic acts. This lack of power has two senses: a lack of power\nover the material domain and, more importantly, an inability to create and\nnurture an autonomous local discourse that can engage in a contest in the\ndiscourse space. This leads to a de-skilling or devalorization of local skills and\nsurrounding institutions. What would a redefined knowledge claim, say, an\nalternative structure of such interventions as SGRY, look like then? Though\nseveral possibilities can be imagined, we did not indulge in such imaginings\nin  this  paper.  We  did  not  pose  a  counter-knowledge  claim.  We  merely\nconfronted the multiple contexts (and the lifeworld woven around them) in\nan effort to seek out the process of implementation of a conceptual knowledge\nclaim and how it encounters the actionable domain. A redefinition of the\ndominant knowledge claim, which is a more creative, imaginative project,\nwill have to await an author\u2014the political strategic actor who has to reconfigure\npower. It is out of that process of conflict, a reassertion of power of the folk\nworld and recreation of a strategic space, that the knowledge claim will be\nredefined and new possibilities of action imagined. In that creative flight of\nfancy, the local discourse that will lend voice must be nurtured. The distant\nacademic scholar can then undertake another interpretational journey, but\none that will deal with variety (and maybe spatial competition) in the discourse\nspace.  Public  administration  and  power  of  higher  tiers  of  bureaucracy,  in\nmanaging the interfaces of contexts, will then have to assume a different role,\na role closer to that of a catalyst\u2014a Gandhian catalyst perhaps.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n217\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f218\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nReferences\n\nBandyapadhyay,  D.,  Sailo  K.

and exclusion are universal concerns. The Copenhagen\nSocial Summit (United Nations 1995, page 2), the International Development\nTargets (IDTs), and the Millennium Declaration of 2000 of the United Nations\n(UNDP 2003)2 all affirm the global commitment to seek solutions to these\nproblems through local initiatives and global partnerships.\n\nPoverty and hunger among women, the oppressed, and the minorities\nare common in developing countries like Nepal. Poverty and exclusion are\nparticularly prevalent in the rural areas of Nepal, where almost 85% of the\npopulation  lives.  Patriarchal  structures,  deep-rooted  social  values,  and  low\nincome generation are major contributory factors. The 1990 Constitution\nupholds the people\u2019s right against discrimination based on caste, creed, sex, or\nreligion, and the Government has introduced various programs to lift people\nout of poverty and exclusion (Law Book Management Committee (1991).\nBut the results have not been very encouraging. Development has largely left\nbehind ethnic communities, dalits (occupational caste groups), and women,\nwho have low participation in governance as well.\n\nThis study looks into the status of poverty and exclusion in Nepal, and\nadministrative  capacity  to  address  such  problems.  It  relies  mostly  on  desk\nresearch and a review of the literature on poverty and exclusion, and on the\neffect of antidiscrimination policies and administrative reforms initiated by\nthe Government. Thirty key informants were also interviewed about the issue.\n\nCauses and Trends of Poverty and Exclusion in Nepal\n\nPoverty has different faces. Some defined indicators are low property\nownership, lack of gainful employment, social discrimination, deprivation,\nand exploitation (Central-Level Program Implementation Committee 1999,\npages  15\u201317).  A  major  indicator  is  the  low  growth  in  gross  development\nproduct (GDP) per capita over the last three decades (Table 1).\n\n1 Associate  Professor  and  Campus  Chief,  Public  Administration  Campus, Tribhuvan  University,\n\nKathmandu, Nepal.\n\n2 These eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were set in 2000: eradicate poverty and hunger;\npromote gender equality and empower women; achieve universal primary education; reduce child\nmortality;  improve  maternal  health;  combat  HIV/AIDs,  malaria,  and  other  diseases;  ensure\nenvironmental sustainability; and develop a global partnership for development.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n221\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f222\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nTable 1: Socioeconomic Growth Rates (%)\n\nIndicator\nReal GDP growth\nAgriculture/GDP\nNonagriculture/GDP\nPopulation\nPer capita income\nAgricultural growth\n\n1971\u20131980\n2.1\n0.5\n7.0\n2.6\n-0.5\n-2.1\n\n1981\u20131990\n4.9\n4.6\n5.2\n2.3\n2.6\n2.3\n\n 1991\u20132001\n5.2\n2.2\n7.8\n2.3\n2.9\n-0.1\n\nGDP = gross domestic product\nSource: MoF (1997) in Nepal South Asia Centre (1998), CBS (2003).\n\nEmployment  is  a  serious  problem  in  Nepal.  Only  47%  of  the  total\neconomically active labor force is fully employed. Around 71% of the labor\nforce employed in agriculture farming is underemployed. The demand for\nNepali labor in the Middle East and other Asian countries over the last few\ndecades has helped to some extent, but the rate of retention of the laborers,\nwho are generally short of skills, has not been good. Violence has also displaced\nmore than a million. Besides, although around 80% of the people depend on\nagriculture, farmed land is just 18% of the total arable land, and those who\nwork the land own only a small portion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2: Size Distribution of Agricultural Land Owned by Households,\nby Region (%)\n\nRegion\n\nMountains\nHills\nTerai\nNepal\n\n<0.5 ha\n41.6\n45.8\n33.2\n40.1\n\nSize of land\n\n0.5\u20132.0 ha\n44.3\n47.6\n47.1\n47.0\n\n>2.0 ha\n14.1\n6.6\n19.7\n12.8\n\nTotal\n100\n100\n100\n100\n\nha = hectare\nSource: Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS 1997); Nepal South Asia Centre (1998), page 118.\n\nSocial inequality has contributed to economic underdevelopment (Bista\n1990).  In  addition,  the  unequal  relations  in  Nepalese  society  in  terms  of\nopportunities lead to both social and economic discrimination (Seddon 1995).\nThere are also long-standing ethnic tensions, communal rivalries, and other\nforms of social stress. The violence associated with the Maoist insurgency over\nthe  last  10  years  has  reached  an  alarming  scale.  Many  analysts  trace  the\ninsurgency to social and economic issues despite the political facade (Panday\n1999, pages 11\u201312).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n222\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fCombating Poverty and Exclusion in Nepal\n\n223\n\nIncidence of Poverty\n\nIn Nepal, the incidence of poverty is reflected in the dismal state of the\neconomy,  the  uneven  distribution  of  productive  resources,  and  high\nunemployment  and  underemployment.  Most  of  the  people  are  still  poor,\nilliterate, and in poor health, natural resources are deteriorating, and social ills\npersist.  Even  with  the  continued  efforts  of  government,  civil  society\norganizations, and international agencies, poverty in Nepal continues to be\nhigh. The poverty rate increased from 36% to 49% between 1977 and 1992.\nBut by the end of FY2003/04 around 31% of the people were living\nbelow the poverty line, compared with 42% in FY1995/96, according to the\nNepal Living Standards Survey (NLSS). During that period, the population\nliving below the poverty line declined by 8 percentage points (from 43% to\n35%) in the rural areas and by 12 percentage points (from 22% to 10%) in\nthe urban areas (CBS 2004).\n\nThis drop could be explained by at least three factors (CBS 2004):\n\n(cid:127) GDP grew at an average rate of 3.4% (2.5% per capita) during the\n\n(cid:127)\n\nfirst to second NLSS survey period\u2014positive indication.\n Agriculture, the backbone of the rural economy, grew by 3.9% per\nyear compared with the FY1995/96 period.\n\n(cid:127) The proportion of households receiving remittances increased from\n\n23% in FY1995/96 to 32% in FY2003/04.\n\nHowever, poverty is still more severe in the rural areas than in the urban\n\nareas, and varies significantly between regions (CBS 2004) (Table 3).\n\nThe factors contributing to rural poverty are:\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127) Highly skewed, urban-centric, and inequitable pattern of economic\ngrowth and development. While the rapid growth in manufacturing,\ntrade,  and  services  primarily  benefited  urban  areas,  rural  incomes\nimproved little over the past two decades, as agricultural growth barely\nexceeded rural population growth.\nLow access of the rural poor to basic social and economic services\nand infrastructure (education, health, drinking water, roads), which\nin turn limits their opportunities for income generation and human\ndevelopment.\nSocial exclusion of certain caste and ethnic groups, women, and those\nliving  in  remote  areas  (from  resources,  income  and  employment\nopportunities, and human development), for a variety of reasons (such\n\n(cid:127)\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n223\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f224\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nTable 3: Poverty Status, by Area\n\nArea\n\nPoverty Rate\n(%)\n\nDistribution of Poor\n (%)\n\nDistribution of\nPopulation (%)\n\nFY\n1995/96\n41.8\n21.6\n43.3\n\nFY\n2003/04\n30.8\n9.6\n34.6\n\nFY\n1995/96\n100.0\n3.6\n96.4\n\nFY\n2003/04\n100.0\n4.7\n95.3\n\nFY\n1995/96\n100.0\n6.9\n93.1\n\nFY\n2003/04\n100.0\n15.0\n85.0\n\nNepal\nUrban\nRural\n\nArea of Surveyveyveyveyvey\nArea of Sur\nArea of Sur\nArea of Sur\nArea of Sur\n\nUrban Area of Kathmandu\nValley\nOther Urban Areas\nRural Western Mountain/Hill\nRural Eastern Mountain/Hill\nRural Western Terai\nRural Eastern Terai\n\nDevelopment Region\nDevelopment Region\nDevelopment Region\nDevelopment Region\nDevelopment Region\n\nEastern\nCentral\nWestern\nMidwestern\nFar-Western\n\nMountain\nHills\nTerai\n\nGeographic Region\nGeographic Region\nGeographic Region\nGeographic Region\nGeographic Region\n\n4.3\n\n31.6\n55.0\n36.1\n46.1\n37.2\n\n38.9\n32.5\n38.6\n59.9\n63.9\n\n57.0\n40.7\n40.3\n\n3.3\n\n13.0\n37.4\n42.9\n38.1\n24.9\n\n29.3\n27.1\n27.1\n44.8\n41.0\n\n32.6\n34.5\n27.6\n\n0.3\n\n3.3\n32.7\n19.4\n18.4\n25.9\n\n21.0\n26.9\n18.7\n18.5\n14.8\n\n10.7\n41.9\n47.4\n\n0.6\n\n4.1\n23.6\n29.4\n18.9\n23.5\n\n23.4\n32.2\n16.7\n17.7\n9.9\n\n7.5\n47.1\n45.4\n\n2.6\n\n4.4\n24.8\n22.4\n16.7\n29.1\n\n22.5\n34.6\n20.3\n12.9\n9.7\n\n7.9\n43.0\n49.2\n\n5.4\n\n9.7\n19.4\n21.1\n15.3\n29.1\n\n24.7\n36.6\n18.9\n12.2\n7.5\n\n7.1\n42.1\n50.8\n\nNote: The rural western hilly region includes the western, midwestern, and far-western Himalayan and hilly regions.

Subsequently, poverty alleviation became\na major objective of the Eighth Plan (1992\u20131997)3 and the only goal of the\nNinth Plan (1997\u20132002), which set long-term targets with various poverty-\nrelated indicators for the first time in the country\u2019s history. Poverty alleviation\nis also the sole objective of the Tenth Plan (2002\u20132007) (NPC 1986, 1993,\n1998, 2003). The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) prepared by the\nGovernment in April 2003, based on the Tenth Plan (2002\u20132007), contains\nthese strategies for mitigating disparities and reducing the poverty rate from\n38% to 30% by the end of the Tenth Plan period (FY2006/07):\n\n(cid:127) Achieving high, broad-based, and sustainable economic growth. While\npromoting faster growth in traditional nonagricultural sectors (such\nas  manufacturing,  trade,  and  services),  the Tenth  Plan  seeks  to\naccelerate agricultural growth to increase incomes, employment, and\nfood security in the rural areas.\nImproving the quality and availability of social and economic services\nand infrastructure (primary education, health care, drinking water\nand sanitation, roads, and electricity) for rural communities.\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127) Ensuring  the  social  and  economic  inclusion  of  the  poor  and\nmarginalized groups by designing and implementing programs under\nthe first two strategies to serve their needs and by carrying out targeted\nprograms for them.\n\n(cid:127) Vigorously  pursing  good  governance  to  improve  service  delivery,\n\nefficiency, accountability, and transparency.\n\nThe  key  to  reducing  poverty,  according  to  the  PRSP,  is  the  effective\nimplementation of programs and delivery of outputs and services. For this\npurpose, it has adopted these crosscutting approaches:\n\n(cid:127)\nLimiting the Government\u2019s role and prioritizing public interventions;\n(cid:127) Accelerating  decentralization  by  transferring  to  local  bodies  the\nresponsibilities and resources for implementing key programs;\nInvolving  the  local  communities  in  the  management  of  village\ndevelopment activities; and\n\n(cid:127)\n\n3\n\nBecause of political change in 1990, FY 1990/91 and FY 1991/92 became plan holidays, i.e., there\nwas no plan during these years.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n226\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fCombating Poverty and Exclusion in Nepal\n\n227\n\n(cid:127) Harnessing the private sector, nongovernment organizations (NGOs),\ninternational  nongovernment  organizations  (INGOs),  and\ncommunity-based  organizations  (CBOs)  for  income-generating\nactivities, service delivery, and community mobilization.\n\nTo  create  an  enabling  environment  for  poverty  reduction,  the  PRSP\nemphasizes  the  importance  of  maintaining  macroeconomic  stability  and\nimplementing  structural  reforms  in  key  areas.

Legal instruments have been set up for\nthis  purpose:  Administrative  Procedures  (Regulation)  Act,  2013;\nAdministrative  Work  Completion  Rules,  2026;  Rules  related  to  Duties,\nResponsibilities and Authority of Administrative Officials, 2042; and Directives\nfor Effective Service Delivery, February 2000. Although the Government has\nnot explicitly defined \u201cbasic services,\u201d its annual budget lists health, education,\ndrinking water, and local development services under the social sector. Such\nbasic services must be made more accessible to the people to reduce poverty.\nHealth. The health sector is of critical importance in reducing human\npoverty, improving the quality of life in rural areas, and sustaining marginalized\ngroups  and  communities.  Health  indicators  have  improved  over  the  past\ndecade, but the health system does not yet adequately meet the needs of the\nrural population, especially the most vulnerable groups and those living in\nremote areas. The key sectoral objectives are: extending essential health-care\nservices to all, especially the rural poor; expanding maternal and child health\nand family planning services, particularly for the rural population; and ensuring\neffective control of communicable diseases (such as malaria, tuberculosis, and\nHIV/AIDS). Positive changes in the health indicators (Table 6) show that\nbasic health services now have a wider reach.\n\nYet health services are poor overall. They are over-centralized and therefore\nunresponsive to local needs, there are not enough trained staff at various levels\nto meet programmed needs, the Government does not have the capacity to\nregulate the growing activities in the private sector and ensure their quality,\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n227\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f228\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nemergency obstetric care is inadequate, and malnutrition among children is\nhigh (48%) by the end of second NLSS survey (CBS 2004).\n\nEducation. Education in Nepal has developed significantly since 1971,\nwhen the New Education Plan was introduced (Table 7). This plan proved to\nbe quite expensive and unmanageable. However, the Government is committed\nto the long-term goal of universal education. The Education for All Plan of\nAction (2003) sets the target of universal education by 2015. The Tenth Plan,\nunder the theme Education for All, seeks to widen access to primary, secondary,\nand vocational/technical and higher education and to improve the quality of\neducation. An expanded literacy program for deprived groups, women, and\ndisadvantaged children is also planned. Decentralization of primary school\nmanagement to local committees, expansion of teacher-training programs,\nimprovement of curriculums and teaching materials (through adequate funding\nand private sector involvement), and strengthening of school monitoring and\nsupervision are part of the strategy.\n\nTable 6: Trends in Health Indicators\n\nHealth Indicator\nMaternal mortality rate/100,000 deliveries\nCrude death rate/1,000 population\nInfant mortality rate/1,000 live births\nTotal fertility rate (15\u201349 years)\nMale/Female ratio\n\nLife expectancy at birth (years)\n\nMean age of marriage (years)\n\nMale\nFemale\n\nMale\nFemale\n\nSource: CBS (2001a).\n\n1981\n850.0\n17.1\n117.0\n5.6\n105.0\n\n50.9\n48.1\n\n20.7\n17.2\n\n1991\n539.0\n13.3\n97.0\n5.1\n99.5\n\n55.0\n53.5\n\n21.4\n18.1\n\n2001\n415.0\n10.0\n64.4\n4.1\n99.8\n\n60.1\n60.7\n\n22.9\n19.5\n\nTable 7: Literacy Trends (6 years and above), by Gender\n\n% of Total\nPopulation\n5.3\n8.9\n13.9\n23.3\n39.6\n54.1\n\n% of Male\nPopulation\n9.5\n16.3\n23.6\n34.0\n54.5\n65.5\n\n% of Female\nPopulation\n0.7\n1.8\n3.9\n12.0\n25.0\n42.8\n\nMale-Female\n Literacy Ratio\n13.57\n9.05\n6.05\n2.83\n2.18\n1.53\n\nSource: Ministry of Population and Environment (2004).\n\nYear\n1952\u20131954\n1961\n1971\n1981\n1991\n2001\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n228\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fCombating Poverty and Exclusion in Nepal\n\n229\n\nLiteracy has improved gradually over the last 50 years, as shown in Table 7.\n\nEducational attainment has also increased (Table 8).\n\nThe  education  program  is  particularly  noteworthy  for  decentralizing\ndelivery to communities and local bodies to improve school management,\nquality of education, accountability, and transparency, with good early results.\nA number of issues still need to be addressed, however.

Sustained efforts by the Government\nin recent years have led to an increase in the proportion of the population\nwith access to potable water, from 37% in 1990 to 72% in 2002. However,\nonly 27% of the population is covered by sanitation facilities (UNDP 2001).\nRural coverage is somewhat less: 70.9% for drinking water and 20% for\nsanitation. Moreover, effective coverage is even lower. Ten percent of the\nsystems are in need of major rehabilitation, and 50%, major repairs. The\nTenth Plan looks forward to increasing sustainable access to safe drinking\nwater  and  basic  sanitation  by  the  rural  population  (including  deprived\ncommunities), while also meeting urban needs. The nationwide coverage of\ndrinking water facilities is expected to rise to 85% by the end of the Tenth\nPlan period (FY2006/07).\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n229\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\f230\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nBroad-Based Economic Growth\n\nEconomic growth must be broad-based to alleviate poverty. Broad-based\neconomic growth in the Nepalese context has two components: accelerating\nagricultural growth (mainstreaming the poor, marginalized communities, and\nwomen,  and  ensuring  food  security);  and  promoting  private  sector\u2013led\nnonagricultural growth.\n\nAccelerating Agricultural Growth. More than 85% of the population\nlives in the rural areas. More than 80% is dependent on agriculture. Poverty\nalleviation is therefore directly related to growth in agriculture. The Agricultural\nPerspective Plan (APP) of 1995, which is endorsed in the Tenth Plan, has the\nmain objective of diversifying and commercializing agriculture by accelerating\ncereal production in the Terai, and promoting horticulture, high-value crops,\nand livestock production through pocket agriculture in the hills and mountains.\nAgricultural productivity is to be increased through modern inputs, technology,\nand  irrigation,  and  the  supporting  infrastructure\u2014roads,  electricity,  and\nmarketing network\u2014is to be strengthened. Also part of the strategy is greater\nprivate sector involvement in the delivery of inputs, services, research, and\nmarketing, and increased participation of communities, farmer groups, and\ncooperatives in the management of infrastructure and assets.\n\nPromoting Nonagricultural Growth. Nonagricultural growth comprises\nthe  following  economic  development  measures:  streamlining  the  role  of\ngovernment and opening up more areas for private investment, reforming\npublic enterprises, facilitating private sector development, implementing trade\npolicy (World Trade Organization) reforms, and reforming the financial sector.\n\nGood Governance\n\nPublic administration must become more enterprising, service-oriented,\nproductive, efficient, cost-effective, transparent, and accountable. At present,\nit is plagued by inefficient service delivery, ineffectual governance, ineffective\nprogram monitoring and evaluation, and the constant shuffling of project\nchiefs and development program managers.\n\nThe state, the private sector, and civil society have collaborated to improve\ngovernance. During the Ninth Plan period (1997\u20132002) various administrative\nreforms  were  introduced  (NPC  1998,  pages  596\u2013597),  particularly  in  the\nfollowing: structure of administrative reform, master planning, governance\nlaws and procedures, employee morale and motivation, management auditing,\nhierarchy  of  functions  and  authority,  civil  service  network,  government\nexamination system and curriculum, and human rights. The Tenth Plan (2002\u2013\n2007) also gives high priority to governance improvements, particularly in\nleadership and governing capacity, and in the quantity and quality of service;\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n230\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fCombating Poverty and Exclusion in Nepal\n\n231\n\nefficiency;  cost-effectiveness;  integrity  and  responsibility;  monitoring  and\nevaluation of development efforts; human rights; and judicial institutions.\n\nMoreover, the Governance Reform Program (GRP) has been under way\nsince 2001, with support from the Government and the Asian Development\nBank.  The  intent  is  to  improve  internal  capacity  for  good  governance,\nstrengthen  the  civil  service,  curb  corruption,  introduce  competition  and\nmotivation  in  the  bureaucracy,  and  improve  performance  appraisal. The\nfollowing institutions have been created to meet these objectives: Administrative\nReform  Commission  Monitoring  Committee,  under  the  Prime  Minister;\nAdministrative  Reform  Committee,  under  the  Minister  for  General\nAdministration; Governance Reform Coordination Unit (a permanent body)\nin the Ministry of General Administration; Efficiency Unit in the Ministry of\nFinance to support the GRP; and Change Management Unit in the Ministries\nof Education and Sports, Agriculture and Cooperatives, Health and Population,\nLand Reform and Management, and Local Development.\n\nTo implement the GRP effectively, the Government has adopted the\nGovernance Reform Program Implementation Policy, 2061 B.S. (2004) This\npolicy advocates merit-based recruitment and promotion in the civil service;\ntimely recruitment of staff; management of complaints and conduct of public\nhearings; gender and social inclusion; adequate salary and benefits; rightsizing\nand professionalization of the bureaucracy; and performance incentives, to be\npilot-tested  at  the  Ministries  of  Education  and  Sports,  Agriculture  and\nCooperatives, and Health and Population (MoGA n.d.).\n\nThe Civil Service Act 2062 B.S. (2005), which replaced the Civil Service\nAct  2049  B.S.  (1992),  has  introduced  two  major  changes.  It  emphasizes\ntraining rather than the academic degrees of civil servants and particularly\nsenior  administrators.  It  also  backs  affirmative  action  in  recruitment  and\nencourages  the  hiring  of  women  and  members  of  socially  deprived\ncommunities. While the impact of these changes has yet to be felt, those who\nare seriously underrepresented in government are greatly heartened.\n\nThe Poverty and Exclusion Issue\n\nPlans  and  programs  for  dealing  with  poverty  and  exclusion  in  Nepal\nhave both positive and negative aspects. On the positive side, the poverty rate\ndecreased by 11 percentage points following the plans and programs of the\n1990s, from 42% in FY1995/96 to 31% in FY2003/04. Some development\ninstitutions also increased significantly in number and scope of operations.\nNGOs had astonishing growth: from 220 in 1990, their numbers swelled to\n25,000  by  the  end  of  2002.  INGO  participation  also  intensified.  INGO\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n231\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f232\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nfunding for development increased from NRs508 million ($10.16 million) in\n1990 to NRs1,192.7 million ($18.93 million)4 in 2000 (Dhakal 2002).\n\nLegislative  acts  and  regulations  empowering  village  and  district\ndevelopment committees, municipalities, and other local institutions, including\nthe  Local  Self-Governance  Act  of  1999,  have  been  passed.  These  legal\nimprovements have broadened the scope of people\u2019s participation through\nCBOs, NGOs, and INGOs, and given local representatives more authority,\nthus bringing more of the poor and the excluded masses into development.\nThe Government has also committed to implement the APP, a 20-year\nplan for 1995\u20132015. The APP includes agricultural programs in support of\npoverty  alleviation,  such  as  the  development  of  cooperative  societies,\nagricultural and rural credit, loans for poverty alleviation, the development of\nwomen farmers, and small farmer development. This plan also aims to increase\nagricultural growth, increase factor productivity, commercialize and diversify\nagricultural  production,  and  alleviate  poverty  and  achieve  significant\nimprovement  in  the  standard  of  living  through  accelerated  growth  and\nexpanded employment opportunities over the short and long term (Agricultural\nProjects Services Centre 1995, pages 3\u20134).\n\nThe protection and use of forest resources by forest users\u2019 groups, activated\nunder community forest and other rural development projects, has helped to\nalleviate poverty by meeting the demand for energy sources. Micro and small\nhydro, biogas, and other alternative energy development programs have also\nbeen helpful in this regard. Other poverty alleviation programs involve physical\ninfrastructure  development,  increased  access  of  the  poor  to  productive\nresources, education and training, social extension and population programs,\nemployment generation, food security, and programs for the community.\n\nOn the other hand, while there have been improvements in educational\nattainment\u2014higher  literacy  and  school  enrollment,  better  health  service\ndelivery at the grassroots level\u2014there are major gaps in services. A basic problem\nis faulty allocation of resources. For example, the education budget for FY1999/\n2000, including regular and development expenditure, was only 13.2% of\nthe total budget, and the health budget was only 5.6% (MoF 2000). Those\ninterviewed for this study agreed that priority should be given to allocating\nenough funds for social sector programs. To do this the Government could\nadopt more decentralized, participatory approaches to development, make\nprudent economies, reduce unit costs, and charge users for the benefits they\nreceive. Otherwise, program implementation cannot be adequate or effective.\n\n4 At NRs50 to $1 in 1990, and NRs63 to $1 in 1996.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n232\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fCombating Poverty and Exclusion in Nepal\n\n233\n\nSome poverty alleviation projects with promising features were rather small in\nsize and coverage, and their replication elsewhere in Nepal seems doubtful.\nWhether and how far the poor and excluded population actually benefits is\nundetermined.\n\nThe lack of accountability, transparency, rule of law, and political and\nadministrative commitment stands in the way of effective implementation.\nThe fruits of development do not reach the poor because of rampant corruption\nand  mismanagement.  Therefore,  even  channeling  foreign  aid  through\ngovernment and NGOs has come under question. It is difficult to understand\nwhere the aid goes and what it achieves, although such support is believed\nessential for improving the livelihood of the poor (Panday 1999, page 11).\n\nPoverty  alleviation  efforts  to  date  have  not  been  broad,  effective,  or\nfocused on the poor and the excluded masses, and the poor are not active\nparticipants. The programs cover only a very small number of the poor, compared\nwith the total. Because of failure to identify the real poor, areas with high poverty\nare  not  reached. There  is  also  a  lack  of  information  at  the  local  level  about\nprograms run by government and NGOs. Besides, such programs are extremely\ndispersed at the field level, and effective monitoring is therefore difficult. As a\nconsequence, output is very low, compared with the investment.\n\nBringing  the  people  into  the  mainstream  of  development,  through\neconomic,  institutional,  political,  and  administrative  and  institutional\ndecentralization is also important in mobilizing human and other resources\nfor  development  (Gurugharana  1996,  pages  31\u201346).  Participation  has\nbroadened somewhat since the 1990s, but the dearth of democratic values\nand the overconcentration of resources at the center are problems. Infrastructure\nand procedural constraints, including the lack of information about market\nopportunities, limit participation. Only capable and informed people have\nroom to develop.\n\nThere are other negative factors as well. Political instability, lack of political\nconsensus, and, most importantly, the violence over the last decade have held\nback  efforts  to  alleviate  poverty  and  mainstream  the  excluded  masses  in\ndevelopment. The recent drop in the Garib Sanga Bishweshwar Karyakram\n(Bishweshwar  with  the  Poor  Program)  and  Mahila  Jagriti  Aaya  Arjan\nKaryakram (Women Awareness and Income Generating Program) shows how\nunsustainable the poverty programs are. These special programs were designed\nto improve the poverty condition of the poor people and empower the socially\nand economically backward women through awareness and income-generating\nactivities. These programs were introduced in the late 1990s when the Nepali\nCongress party was in government. When the King took power on 1 February\n2005, these programs were dropped because of political bias.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n233\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f234\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nPoverty and exclusion cannot be reduced without creating employment\nopportunities, but opportunities are constrained by the ongoing violence and\ngovernment  instability.  Nonagricultural  activities  have  been  heavily\nconcentrated in the urban areas, and linkages between economic sectors have\nbeen difficult to establish. Human development and human empowerment\nindicators in Nepal are very low. Improving them is a great challenge.\n\nConclusion\n\nNepal  has  struggled  to  solve  the  problem  of  poverty  and  exclusion.\nDevelopment plans and various measures have been adopted in the effort to\ndeal with this problem. However, intermingled with the socioeconomic issues\nare  political,  cultural,  and  administrative  problems,  which  make  change\ndifficult.The confusion, mistrust, and conflict among the King, parliamentary\nparties, and the Maoist rebels, and particularly the dual government\u2014the old\nsatta (official government) in the townships, district headquarters, and the\ncapital,  and  the  naya  satta  (unofficial  rule  of  the  Maoist  rebels)  in  the\ncountryside\u2014have severely affected governance.\n\nThe Government has brought the Maoist rebels into the peace process.\nBut all the three parties to the conflict\u2014the parliamentary parties, the King,\nand  the  Maoist  rebels\u2014are  unyielding. The  King  insists  on  his  style  of\nadministration and role in the Constitution. As commander of the military\nforces,  he  has  the  authority  to  use  these  forces. The  major  parliamentary\npolitical parties5 are in the streets demanding the restoration of the House of\nRepresentatives, which was dissolved in June 2002. The seven-party andolan\n(movement) they called is under way. The Maoist rebels living in the jungle\nhave been fighting for an autocratic government. They support neither fresh\nelections nor the reestablishment of the House of Representatives. How these\nparties  can  be  brought  to  a  consensus  has  confounded  those  who  seek  to\nmake peace.\n\nFor all its creditable intentions, the Government lacks the commitment\nand the necessary coordination with organizations outside government to make\nits targeted programs work. Education is the foundation for improving human\nquality, alleviating poverty, and solving the problem of exclusion. Meanwhile,\nhowever,  teachers  and  schoolchildren  in  Maoist-controlled  areas  are  being\nabducted and school premises are being used as training grounds by the Maoists.\n\n5 Major political parties that favor a parliamentary democratic system are the Nepali Congress Party,\nNepal Sadbhavana Party (Anandidevi), Nepal Labour and Peasant Party, United Left Front, Nepali\nCongress (Democratic) United Marxist-Leninist (UML), and the Communist Party of Nepal, Marxist-\nLeninist (CPN/ML).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n234\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fCombating Poverty and Exclusion in Nepal\n\n235\n\nAdministrative  capacity  is  indeed  important  in  mobilizing  socioeconomic\nresources for the poor and the excluded masses.

Khalid Nadeem Khan1\n\nSyed Abu Ahmad Akif2\n\nIntroduction\n\nInequality, poverty, and social strife are not new to humankind. From\nthe beginning of recorded history, every society has had these problems. What\nis  equally  true  is  that  members  of  various  human  groups  have  tried  to  do\nsomething about them to blunt their sting and turn ill into good. The scales\nin which human societies place themselves, and in which they desire balance\namong their members, keep tipping one way or the other as equality turns\ntoward inequality and back.\n\nAny effort at social harmony requires understanding the reasons for these\nswings of the equality-inequality balance. It is very important to appreciate\nthat human inequality and inequity are not the result of some natural process.\nRather, the roots of these negative phenomena lie in decisions and actions\ntaken by individual members and collective institutions of society in general,\nand by governments and influential persons in particular, which affect the\ndistribution of resources and the treatment of groups in positions of advantage\nor disadvantage.\n\nTime and time again, numerous economic, political, and social factors\nhave  disrupted  the  pursuit  of  egalitarian  ideals.  Distributional  policies  of\ngovernment (and of other power groups) have a major role in determining\ndistributional outcomes. Governments influence the distribution of resources\nnot only through fiscal decisions but also through the quality of public sector\nmanagement,  which  plays  a  more  significant  role  than  just  spending  or\ncollecting revenues.\n\nThroughout  history,  inequality  has  been  regarded  as  unfair  and\ncounterproductive. More often than not, social upheavals, revolutions, and\nchanges in government have been attributed to inequality. Apart from the\ncommon aversion to it, inequality has a strong negative impact on economic\ngrowth through various channels. High inequality pushes the poor to vote for\n\n1\n\nInstructor/Research Associate, National Institute of Public Administration, Karachi, Pakistan.\n\n2 Chief Instructor, National Institute of Public Administration, Karachi, Pakistan.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n239\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f240\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nredistributive  rather  than  growth-enhancing  policies. Where  voters  cannot\ninfluence  public  policy,  in  the  absence  of  democratic  dispensation,  and\nmercantile classes relentlessly pursue growth-enhancing policies, the result is\never-increasing  economic  and  social  disparity,  which  continues  despite  a\nprogressively larger pie, as the relative distribution either remains unaltered or\nfavors the rich even more (Alesina and Rodrik 1994, Persson and Tabellini\n1994).\n\nHigh inequality prevents the poor from investing in education (human\ncapital development) and, as a result, from pursuing most opportunities for\ngainful employment and profitable business. A poor family that cannot invest\nin education and skill development only produces more poor (Galor and Zeira\n1993, Benabou 1996). The rich, too, may not invest in human capital so as to\nkeep the poor majority politically inactive and forestall their ability to exert\npressure for better distribution policies (Bourguignon and Verdier 2000). The\nconsequence of these actions is a situation where the state is captured by the\nrich and powerful. In this scenario, public administrators tend to serve the\nobjectives of elitist interest groups and their own objectives rather than pursuing\nthe general welfare (Keefer and Knack 2002). Thus, inequality neither comes\nabout nor disappears on its own. The vicious cycle of poverty and inequality\nis the direct result of state capture.\n\nOnce a society is divided on the basis of income and consumption levels,\nits  political  stability  is  eroded  and  people  start  becoming  dissatisfied  with\ntheir economic status. In such a situation, a consensus between groups with\nhigher incomes and those with lower incomes becomes increasingly difficult\nto achieve. Political instability hinders and diminishes foreign and domestic\ninvestment as the risk of change in policy increases. In turn, low investment\nresults in fewer income opportunities, especially for the lower-income groups;3\nconsequently, the developmental potential is undermined. Societies with highly\nunequal distribution manifest certain unproductive\u2014if not disruptive\u2014norms\nof behavior as social mistrust increases and government credibility decreases.\nThis  results  in  a  higher  cost  of  doing  business,  which  then  hampers  the\nfrequency of economic exchange. Because of these far-reaching consequences,\ninequality becomes a greater concern for the public sector.\n\nWith the decision and actions of the public sector intricately linked with\nthe levels of equality and inequality, the quality of public sector institutions is\nvital  for  any  social  improvement  or  political  and  economic  development.\n\n3\n\n\u201cHigh inequality reduces the pool of people with access to the resources\u2014such as land or education\u2014\nneeded to unleash their full productive potential. Thus a country deprives itself of the contributions\nthe poor could make to its economic and social development\u201d (World Bank 2005).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n240\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fThe Quality of Public Sector Management and Economic Inequality\n\n241\n\nAlthough this role of the public sector has been prevalent for centuries, the\ndebate on the efficiency and legitimacy of the public sector and its involvement\nin business and nonbusiness activities has replaced discussion on the impact\nof the quality of public sector management on the economic and social system.\nIn the 1990s,4 a number of studies evaluating the impact of public institutions\non the economy\u2014especially on development outcomes\u2014emerged. Study after\nstudy demonstrated that the institutional settings determine the rules of the\ngame  and  therefore  have  an  impact  on  the  effectiveness  and  frequency  of\nexchange and production. Furthermore, an efficient and effective institutional\nstructure is the backbone of a sustainable social and economic structure.\n\nSome institutions5 have a much greater role in determining a certain\noutcome than others. For example, the police and the courts have significant\nroles in protecting life and property and resolving disputes. Rodrik (2003)\nclassifies institutions into five main categories: (i) market-creating institutions\nassociated  with  property  rights;  (ii)  market-regulating  institutions  creating\nsocial and governance boundaries; (iii) market-stabilizing institutions providing\nmacroeconomic stability; (iv) institutions for social insurance; and (v) market-\nlegitimizing institutions for conflict management. This classification covers\nall  the  routes  through  which  an  institutional  structure  can  influence  the\neconomic and social fabric.\n\nWith public sector institutions6 monitoring or regulating most of these\ninstitutions and their functions, any weakness in the institutional structure of\nthe  public  sector  will  necessarily  result  in  economic  and  social  distortion.\nFragile public sector management in transitional and developing countries has\ndemonstrated that the deterioration or unavailability of appropriate institutions\nhinders the ability of these societies to develop socially and economically. The\ntheoretical and empirical literature supports these propositions.\n\n4 The discussion and evaluation of this impact is not specific to the 1990s, but this decade is significant\n\nbecause of its special attention to institutional weaknesses and their results.\n\n5 A generally accepted definition of institutions is the one given by North (1981, pages 201\u2013202): \u201ca\nset of rules, compliance procedures, and moral and ethical behavioural norms designed to constrain\nthe behaviour of individuals in the interests of maximizing the wealth or utility of principals.\u201d Glaeser\net al. (2004) and Glaeser and Claudia (2004) stressed their role as \u201cconstraints\u201d on the executive\npower and their persistence in time\u2014\u201ddurability\u201d\u2014in order to exert a powerful constraint.\n\n6\n\nProperty rights are explained and protected by government institutions that have the constitutional\nright to define property rights and the necessary powers to enforce these rights. However, there are\nsituations in which a community or other organized groups compete for or complement these functions,\nbecoming quasi-governmental institutions in the process. Most regulatory institutions are established\nand supported by the state, and the state therefore has a direct bearing on the working of regulatory\ninstitutions. Thus,  we  see  that  in  spite  of  the  theoretical  independence  of  the  monetary  and  fiscal\nstructures, these two institutions are controlled by the state. Similarly, the state also provides social\nsecurity and balances individual rights through dispute resolution mechanisms, i.e., the courts.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n241\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f242\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nThis  study  raises  the  fundamental  question,  Can  the  quality  of  public\nsector management affect economic inequality? While intuitive arguments have\ndemonstrated and continue to support this assertion, this study finds the answer\nto this question through a systematic methodology. Thus, the contribution of\nthis  study  is  twofold:  (i)  it  provides  insights  into  the  relationship  between\ngovernance and inequality; and (ii) it analyzes data for empirical evidence.\n\nTo achieve these two objectives and assess the impact of public sector\nmanagement,  this  paper  identifies  four  dimensions  of  public  sector\nmanagement quality: government effectiveness, regulatory burden, rule of law,\nand control of corruption.\n\nThe first dimension covers the effectiveness of the government system\nand measures how competent public officials can accomplish its functions. It\nalso embraces the answer to the question, What is the quality of service delivery\nin a country?\n\nThe second dimension deals with the use of power by public officials,\nespecially how this aspect affects the functioning of the free market. Regulatory\nburden measures the incidence of \u201cmarket-unfriendly\u201d policies such as price\ncontrols or inadequate bank supervision, as well as perceptions of the burdens\nimposed by excessive regulation in areas such as foreign trade and business\ndevelopment. Taken together, government effectiveness and regulatory burden\nmeasure the ability of the public sector to formulate and implement sound\npolicies.\n\nThe third dimension covers the \u201cquality of contract enforcement,\u201d the\neffectiveness of the police and the courts, and the \u201clikelihood of crime and\nviolence.\u201d Finally, control of corruption deals with the overall quality of public\nsector management. This indicator measures the extent to which powers of\npublic office are exercised for private gain.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows. The next section reviews the literature\nto  gather  theoretical  and  empirical  insights  into  the  relationship  between\ngovernance and equality. The rest of the paper deals with the empirical strategy,\nissues related to the data, the study results and interpretation, and conclusions.\n\nReview of the Literature\n\nMany theories, based on both economic and noneconomic factors, have\nbeen proposed to explain the process (of reducing inequality and improving\nthe quality of governance) and to identify and differentiate between the factors\nthat  can  directly  or  indirectly  result  in  economic  inequality. This  review,\nhowever, focuses on the noneconomic explanations of economic inequality\nand, more specifically, builds an argument on the basis of the institutional\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n242\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fThe Quality of Public Sector Management and Economic Inequality\n\n243\n\ntheme7 to find answers to the questions, Is there a relationship between the\nquality of public sector management and economic inequality? If so, what are\nthe channels through which an improved quality public sector management\naffects economic inequality? The answers to these questions require a basic\nunderstanding of the relationship between economic activity and public sector\nmanagement.\n\nThe  importance  of  the  role  of  state  and  the  state  functionaries  dates\n\nback to Plato, or even earlier, as Plato states in The Republic:8\n\nbut when the guardians of the laws and of the government are only seeming\nand not real guardians, then see how they turn the State upside down; and\non the other hand they alone have the power of giving order and happiness\nto  the  State.  We  mean  our  guardians  to  be  true  saviours  and  not  the\ndestroyers of the State....\n\nWhile the boundaries between policy makers and implementers were\nnot as well defined in Plato\u2019s time, even today it is widely recognized that the\n\u201cguardians  of  the  law  and  of  the  government\u201d  (including  both  political\nrepresentatives who formulate policies and public functionaries who implement\nthese policies) have a direct impact on the functioning of the state. Furthermore,\nthrough their grip on the functions of the state, they affect the functioning of\neconomic life. Economic history is replete with both support and opposition\nfor the involvement of the state in economic affairs. In the period before the\nindustrial revolution, the emphasis on the state\u2019s role as regulator and controller\nwas a philosophical \u201cabsolute minimum.\u201d Contrary to popular belief, Adam\nSmith  wrote  in  favor  of  a  state  role  in  economic  activity:  in  part  three  of\nWealth  of  Nations  he  states:  \u201cthe  other  works  and  institutions  of  this  kind\n[public  institutions  and  public  works]  are  chiefly  those  for  facilitating  the\ncommerce of the society and those for the instruction [education] of people.\u201d\nThe industrial revolution brought the efficiency of the public sector\nmanagement into sharp focus as the demand for infrastructure rose sharply\n\n7 The three common themes regarding the involvement of public administrative systems in economic\ndevelopment are: institutional, neoclassic, and pluralist and Marxist-derived. The institutional view\nmaintains the position that market development is contingent on the establishment of institutional\nstructure,  which  provides  a  neutral  regulatory  environment  for  the  operation  of  free  markets.\nProponents  of  the  neoclassic  view  hold  that  markets  take  care  of  everything  and  deregulation  is\nnecessary to ensure economic development. The pluralist and Marxist-derived position asserts that\nmarkets and market-related institutions are a product of social and political interests and conflicts.\nInteraction between these interests and conflicts shapes the course of development.\n8 Available at: http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.html; accessed on 28 Nov, 2005.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n243\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f244\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nwhile  red  tape  (largely  inherited  from  the  monarchical  regimes,  which  were\ndistant from the people at large) hampered the pace of industrial activity. The\npost-Depression popularity of Keynesian thoughts and post\u2013Second World War\nreconstruction efforts demonstrated that an efficient public sector was necessary\nfor initiating and maintaining a high pace of economic activity. As the issue\nbecame one of peripheral interest to economists, political scientists took the\nlead in producing case studies. In 1970s and 1980s, a reversal was seen with the\nrise  of  neoclassic  political,  and  rational-choice  analyses,  which  revived  the\nSmithian perspective9 (Krueger 1974, Colclough and Manor 1991).\n\nThis  perspective  essentially  limits  the  involvement  of  the  state  in\ninvestment activities but has little to do with the functioning and management\nof the public sector. The factoring of public sector efficiency and its subsequent\nimpact  on  the  development  and  implementation  of  policy  having  been\ndisregarded\u2014to the point of almost total exclusion from economic analyses\n(especially in development accounting)\u2014has resulted in the failure of many\ndevelopment efforts.10\n\nThe rise of the new industrial states, especially the East Asian \u201ctiger\u201d\ncountries, provides evidence that a fast rate of industrial development is possible\nonce  public  sector  functionaries  pave  the  way  through  infrastructure\ndevelopment and systemic facilitation. The importance of an efficient public\nsector  has  been  realized  and  further  underscored  after  the  emergence  of\ntransition economies and their varied development experiences.\n\nIn fact, the transition experience fueled a debate in which success stories\nbegan depicting paradoxical results. On the one hand, the state was shown to\nbe a benevolent leader of the development process\u2014an \u201comniscient social-\nwelfare maximizer\u201d\u2014while, on the other hand, it was also seen as a major\nobstacle to development as public administrators act in behalf of politicians\nand other interest groups. This debate targets an altogether different question:\nWhat is the impact of public policy on economic development?\nThe former position is supported by five arguments:11\n\n(cid:127) Market failure resulting from externalities, missing markets, extensive\n\npublic goods, and information asymmetries;\n\n9 Adam Smith\u2019s views correspond to the standard laissez-faire position, where government intervention\nin economic affairs is recognized as welfare-decreasing; however, government is allowed to provide\ncritical public goods to society, e g., defense.\n\n10 The most obvious example is the structural adjustment program, which created more distortions\nrather than removing impediments to higher growth and broad-based welfare; critics even blame the\nrampant poverty in the 1990s on the structural adjustment programs.\n\n11 For more details, see Stern (1989 and 1991).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n244\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fThe Quality of Public Sector Management and Economic Inequality\n\n245\n\n(cid:127) Redistribution  concerns  originating  from  poverty  and  prevalent\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\ninequality in societies;\nProvision of facilities such as education, health, law and order, dispute\nresolution mechanisms, and housing;\nPaternalism: (subsidies to the private sector for maintaining a social\nsecurity system); and\n\n(cid:127) Management  of  intergenerational  concerns,  e.g.,  acting  to  protect\nthe  rights  of  future  generations,  as  in  environmental  conservation\nand sustainable development.\n\nThese arguments strengthened when a new institutional approach was\nseen  in  the  World  Bank\u2019s  (1991)  World  Development  Report,  under  which\ninstitutional  restructuring,  public  service  reforms,  and  establishment  of\nregulatory frameworks to ensure competition, as well as legal and property\nrights, were added to its market-friendly agenda for government. However, in\n1997 the World Development Report was dedicated to \u201cThe State in a Changing\nWorld.\u201d This realization was reinforced when Richard Barro pressed his path-\nbreaking cross-country analysis of economic growth.\n\nWhile growth literature has taken another turn from exogenous growth\nto endogenous growth, this theoretical redirection reinforces the institutional\npolitical economy and leads to the conclusion that \u201cinstitutional factors have\na  fundamental  effect  on  rate  of  growth\u201d  (Rauch  and  Evans  2000).12 The\nimplications of \u201cendogenous growth theory\u201d are deeper than technological\nshocks and learning effects, as these look straight into the heart of the problem\nby  proposing  a  growth  perspective  in  which  the  impact  of  a  variety  of\nnoneconomic variables, especially state operations, was given more weight. In\none of the most significant contributions to this field, Barro (1991) studied\nthe negative impact of government consumption on growth rates.\n\nEven though Barro\u2019s approach provides an understanding of the issue,\nthe  proxy  that  he  used  does  not  capture  the  quality  of  public  sector\nmanagement; rather it covers the fiscal management ability of the government.\nIt  was  the  revisionist  studies  of  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Singapore,  and\nTaipei,China that brought currency to the concept of a \u201cdevelopmental state\u201d\n(Rauch and Evans 2000). Among others, Knack and Keefer (1995) found\nthat country ratings by the International Currency Risk Guide and Business\nand Environmental Risk Intelligence were significant predictors of variations\nin gross development product (GDP) per capita in the data. Mauro (1995),\n\n12 For more details, see Lucas (1988), and Romer (1986, 1990, and 1994).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n245\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f246\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nusing  ratings  on  \u201ccorruption\u201d  and  \u201cred  tape\u201d  from  Business  International,\nfound that variations in these ratings across the countries provided a statistically\nsignificant explanation for variations in the rate of investment (which is the\nsingle most significant factor determining the rate of economic growth). The\nuse of corruption and red-tape ratings was a step in the right direction, as\nboth these variables capture the quality of public sector management.\n\nWhile  all  these  studies  estimate  the  impact  of  state  functioning  on\neconomic growth, the debate has not covered the impact of public policies\nand  the  quality  of  public  sector  management  on  distributional  outcomes.\nThis is surprising, given the fact that a strong reason for state regulatory and\nenabling  initiatives  is  to  reduce  poverty  levels  and  the  ever-increasing\ndistributional gap between various groups of society.\n\nFrom the very fact that the public sector has a redistribution and poverty\nalleviation responsibility, we are obliged to conclude that the quality of public\nsector  management  has  a  consequential  impact  on  economic  inequality.\nAnother  argument  that  supports  this  conclusion  is  the  rule-making  and\nregulatory function of the public sector; it is widely appreciated that the quality\nof the rules of the game in market-based economies directly affects economic\nperformance (Hall and Jones 1999, Rodrik 1999 and 2003). Indeed, public\nsector  institutions  are  the  more  influential  factor  in  development  and\ndistributional outcomes when compared with geography and openness of trade\n(Rodrik, Subramanian, and Trebbi 2004).\n\nPublic sector institutions have the responsibility of ensuring equality of\nopportunity through equal access to services like health, education, and legal\nservices. After protection of life and liberty, the sanctity of property rights is\nthe most fundamental to any opportunity for business and employment. Only\nwhen state institutions are able to provide protection for the property rights\nof all individuals without discrimination will it be possible for all members of\nthe society to invest their funds and make efforts for a profitable business or\ngainful  employment.  However,  if  the  property  rights  of  some  groups  are\nprotected  over  and  above  similar  rights  of  other  groups  (i.e.,  the  rich  and\npowerful get their way when they are in unlawful possession of the property\nof the poor and powerless), the state institutions begin to strengthen economic\ninequality, howsoever defended (an unintended or unconscious outcome) and\nhowsoever perceived. Groups with more protection have protected assets and\nare therefore able to invest with greater security. As a result, their share in the\nnational  income  increases  and  the  share  of  unprotected  groups  decreases.\nClosely  related  to  public  sector  institutions  mandated  to  enforce  property\nrights are institutions of contract enforcement.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n246\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fThe Quality of Public Sector Management and Economic Inequality\n\n247\n\nSince the public sector enjoys a monopoly over state power, it is only the\npublic sector that can enforce legal contracts when one or more parties to the\ncontract  fail  to  meet  their  obligations.  In  the  absence  of  a  secure  legal\nenvironment,  where  state  authority  is  unwilling  or  unable  to  enforce  the\ncontract, a premium has to be paid for gaining protection from the illegal\ndemands of both state and nonstate actors that increases the cost of doing\nbusiness; as a result, fewer parties are willing to enter into contracts.13  People\nwill not invest \u201cif property rights are not well defined and enforced, or if they\n[the parties involved in the contracts] believe that the contracts they write will\nnot be honored or that courts of law will not be fair\u201d (World Bank 2006).\nState institutions that cannot enforce contractual obligations in general\u2014and\nespecially those contracts that relate to economic development\u2014need more\nsafeguards and guarantees of independence from political powers, any costs\nof  which  will  be  more  than  covered  by  the  higher  investments  in  a  better\nbusiness climate.\n\nThe public sector not only enforces property and contract rights but\nalso  provides  infrastructure,  regulatory,  judicial,  and  facilitative  services  to\nbusiness and society through efficient and honest public functionaries in the\npolice and judiciary, as well as social services (education, health, etc.). Societies\nthat have established efficient public sector institutions that guarantee equality\nof opportunity have enjoyed sustainable prosperity and long-term well-being.\nAs the World Bank (2006) concludes:\n\nTo take an extreme example, institutions were severely inequitable in slave\nsocieties, such as Haiti or Barbados in the eighteenth century. Even though\nproperty rights in land and people were well defined and even well enforced\n(although subject to potential slave rebellions), most people had no property\nrights and were thus subject to expropriation by others, particularly their\nmasters. For 95 percent of society, there were no incentives to engage in\nsocially  desirable  activities.  A  similar,  although  somewhat  less  extreme,\nexample  of  inequitable  institutions  is  South  Africa  under  apartheid.\nInstitutions  there  were  good  for  the  whites  but  left  80  percent  of  the\npopulation without incentives or opportunities to engage in economically\nproductive activities (page 107).\n\n13\n\n Corporate finance is a difficult mode of financing in societies where either property rights institutions\nare  inefficient  or  the  contract  enforcement  agencies  (courts)  are  unable  to  efficiently  accomplish\ntheir functions; for more details, see La Porta et al. (1998).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n247\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f248\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nWhile protection of property rights is by no means sufficient to ensure\nthe  total  absence  of  inequality,  it  is  nonetheless  needed  to  curb  economic\ninequality. The quality of public sector management and accessibility of public\nservices  to  all  social  groups  (equitable  distribution)  is  a  precondition  for\ncontrolling  poverty  and  inequality. The  de  facto  status  of  public  sector\nmanagement  is  more  relevant  in  evaluating  its  impact  on  distributional\noutcomes.\n\nAccordingly, this study employs four separate hypotheses covering the\nfour dimensions of government effectiveness, regulation quality, rule of law,\nand control of corruption.\n\nGovernment Effectiveness and Economic Inequality\n\nThe first channel through which the quality of public sector management\naffects distributional outcomes is the \u201coverall effectiveness\u201d of the government.\nThis \u201coverall effectiveness\u201d includes the competence of public functionaries\nand the quality of services they deliver. The efficiency and quality of services\ndelivered by the public functionaries are crucial in determining the level of\nequality or inequality. If the services are provided only to the rich and powerful\nor if the general quality of the services (for the common people) is poor and\nthe public sector is not efficient in getting things done, this would naturally\nresult  in  better  income  opportunities  for  the  powerful,  who  then  become\neven more resourceful; in such a case, the income disparity increases. If the\npublic services are provided evenly and the quality of the services is good,\nincome distribution improves and, consequently, marginalized groups have\ngreater chances of coming out of the poverty trap.\n\nIn addition, the extent to which the public sector is free from political\npressure and the extent to which policies remain internally consistent and\npredictable will also determine the ability of the public sector to deliver public\ngoods and services to all the sectors of the population. On the contrary, if elite\ncapture  of  the  state  prevails  and  the  public  sector  serves  the  political  and\neconomic elite, the public sector shall not be able to deliver public goods and\nservices to all the sectors of the population. Thus, the overall effectiveness of\nthe  public  sector  in  formulating  and  implementing  effective  policies  and\ndelivering public goods is dependent on a complete accounting of \u201cinputs\u201d\ninto the public sector. Access to social services, especially education and health,\nis the main determinant of life expectancy and employability.

In fact, it is by developing a set of\nregulations that the public sector establishes the rules of the game. If the rules\nand regulations are unnecessary (overregulation) or favor a certain group of\nindividuals, then the absence of quality of opportunity with regard to entry\ninto  a  business  creates  two  groups:  one  that  can  play  in  the  given  set  of\nregulations, and another that cannot. This division then determines the benefits\nthat the given sets of individuals may derive from the economic activity. Thus,\nif government policies are not market-friendly and employ techniques like\nprice controls or over- and under-regulation, there is a high possibility that\ninequality will increase (Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi 2005).\n\nThe most common example of policies antagonistic to the market is the\ncreation of a monopoly by the government or the distribution of permits to\nregulate market distribution. The resourceful who are able to get permits at\nthe cost of excluding others succeed in gaining benefits from the monopoly.\nThis exclusion shifts the balance of distribution of income and investment\ntoward the powerful, and the result is economic inequality.\nHypothesis  2  (H2): When  government  intervenes  through  market-unfriendly\npolicies,  low-income  groups  have  less  chance  of  doing  business  or  entering  into\ngainful employment; consequently, inequality increases.\n\nRule of Law, and Economic Inequality\n\nThe  quality  of  contract  enforcement  is  a  significant  determinant  of\ninvestment.  Economies  in  which  the  rule  of  law  is  adequate  have  higher\navailability of finance and see greater amounts of external finance pouring in;\nthus, investment grows rapidly (La Porta et al. 1998). The quality of contract\nenforcement incorporates not only efficiency of the enforcement system, i.e.,\nthe courts, but also effectiveness of the police as well as the \u201clikelihood of\ncrime and violence.\u201d\n\nResearchers  have  pointed  out  that  Anglo-Saxon  \u201ccommon  law\u201d\nsupposedly delivers better protection of property rights and a more limited\nand efficient state than the French \u201ccivil law\u201d legal systems (La Porta et al.\n1998, 1999). In a panel study Barro (1996) finds a consistently positive and\nsignificant effect of property rights on growth. Even though his study does\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n249\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f250\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nnot cover the distribution of gains from economic growth, it is obvious that\nindividuals  and  groups  having  greater  access  to  investment  and  other\neconomic opportunities necessarily obtain the greater share of gains from\ngrowth. Dollar and Kraay (2000) explore this dimension and conclude that\nbetter rule of law raises real per capita income, as people spend less on private\nprotection strategies. Knack and Keefer (1995) prove that security of contract\nand property rights significantly affect opportunities for investment. This\nobliges us to conclude that the rule of law indirectly affects the generation\nand distribution of income.\n\nIf the rule of law is weak then there emerge two groups: one that can\nenforce its contracts, stand against crime and violence, and invent private\nmechanisms for security, and another that is unable to match the strength\nof the first group because of political powerlessness. This results in the poor\nsuffering from an inequality of opportunity for services, gainful employment,\nand business investment. On the other hand, the politically influential and\neconomically prosperous face no competition and enjoy ample opportunities.\nThis  disparity  gets  further  reinforced  when  the  politically  influential  are\nable  to  have  public  policy  redesigned  so  as  to  obtain  finance  and  other\nresources and have public resources allocated to safeguard their interests at\nthe  cost  of  the  interests  of  powerless  groups.  This  gives  momentum  to\neconomic inequality, and the vicious cycle of inequality keeps repeating and\nreinforcing itself.\nHypothesis 3 (H3): In the absence of rule of law, low-income groups either pay a\nhigher cost for dispute resolution or lose a major share of their investment and\nresources; consequently, in the long run, economic disparity increases because of the\nhigher cost of obtaining protection (for property and contracts) and doing business.\n\nControl of Corruption, and Economic Inequality\n\nCorruption in the public sector is of two types: apparent and hidden.\nThe  first\u2014petty  corruption\u2014mostly  comprises  \u201csmall\u201d  monetary  benefits\nobtained by public functionaries to fill gaps in income or to meet routine\naspirations; this, while appearing high in any general perception of social ills,\nis  not  as  dangerous  as  the  second,  or  hidden,  variety.  It  is  this  obscured\ncorruption that is systemic and \u201cgrand\u201d; this corruption paralyzes the state\u2019s\noperations and plays a vital part in the elite capture of the state, wherein the\npolicy formulation process is modified to benefit certain interest groups. The\npresence of corruption is often a \u201cmanifestation of a lack of respect by both\nthe corrupter (typically a private citizen or firm) and the corrupted (typically\na  paid  public  functionary  or  an  elected  office  holder)  for  the  rules  which\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n250\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fThe Quality of Public Sector Management and Economic Inequality\n\n251\n\ngovern  their  interactions,  and  hence  represents  a  failure  of  governance\u201d\n(Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi 2005).\n\nCorruption is the backbone of all disparities, as the resourceful are able\nto pay the highest bribes or bring to bear the strongest influence through their\npolitical and economic standing; as a result, the distribution and delivery of\npublic services and the enforcement of regulations through the courts and\npolice are compromised. As an example we can consider a situation in which\npublic expenditures are diverted toward a certain region, group, or class because\nthe public functionary or elected office holder either has been successfully\nbribed or has some other personal objectives to pursue. Whatever the reason\nbehind  this  diversion,  the  result  is  conflict,  social  strife,  and  continued\ndeprivation  of  other  areas,  regions,  or  classes,  which  must  suffer  the\nconsequences of the exclusion for a long time. In fact, in the case of \u201cgrand\ncorruption\u201d all public administrative structures become rent seeking and the\npower of the public office is exercised almost totally to secure private gains.\nThe welfare and distributional impact of endemic corruption in the public\nsector has long been a matter of lively debate among economists. The question,\nDoes corruption have a beneficial or detrimental impact upon economy and\npublic welfare? has been analyzed mainly in two models: the classical model\nand the principal-agent model.\n\nPublic Corruption in the Classical Model. Corruption in the public\nsector  has  been  considered  an  efficiency-enhancing  mechanism  by  some\neconomists such as Bayley (1966), Huntington (1968), Leff (1964), Morgan\n(1964), and Nye (1967). They argue that corruption overcomes cumbersome\nregulations, excessive bureaucracy, or regulatory obstacles and therefore corrects\nthe  slow  pace  of  public  administration. The  efficiency  argument  does  not\ntake  into  consideration  the  distributional  or  welfare  consequences  of  the\ncorrupting  process.  Merely  expediting  bureaucratic  process  or  overcoming\nregulatory hurdles is not an end in itself; the real questions are: Who pays the\nbribe?  and  What  does  he  or  she  get  as  a  result? The  efficiency-enhancing\nconclusion is based on the assumption that after paying the bribe the corruptor\ncompletes the project according to the conditions of the contract. However,\nthis assumption is far from reality, as the corruptor tries to escape as many\nconditions as he or she can and the result is low-quality projects and even\nworse policies that those in place before the corruption process.\n\nThrough low project quality or ineffective public policy, it is ultimately\nthe taxpayers who lose their contribution to the state and forfeit the benefits of\nthe social contract. The poor pay a greater price, as they are deprived of public\nservices and cannot get equal protection from law-enforcing authorities. Myrdal\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n251\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f252\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\n(1968) and Rose-Ackerman (1978) oppose this view on the premise that once\npublic sector officials are bribed to speed up the process, they put in place more\nadministrative hurdles to maximize their return; this is similar to the mechanism\nby which monopolists hike the price by creating artificial scarcity.\n\nThe distributional impact of corruption goes deeper, because it benefits\nonly the two parties that are directly involved in the corruption transaction\nprocess\u2014the corruptor and the corrupted. On the other hand, the corrupt\ntransaction generates externalities, and, thus, the cost is paid by the whole\nsociety, more specifically the poor and marginalized. While only a case-by-\ncase, transaction-by-transaction cost-benefit analysis can reveal the spillover\nimpact of corruption by public officials, the endemic nature of corruption\nobliges us to conclude that poor institutional settings encourage corruption,\nwhich,  in  turn,  provides  the  motivation  for  illegal  decisions,  wrong\nimplementation of policies, and simple opportunism. Thus, biased decision\nmaking at the operation level and \u201cstate capture\u201d at the policy level certainly\nmake the distribution worse.\n\nPublic Corruption in the Principal-Agent Approach. Rose-Ackerman\n(1978),  Jain  (1998),  and  Klitgaard  (1988)  apply  the  principal-agent  (PA)\napproach to understand the impact of public sector corruption. In the PA\nmodel the principal (government) creates rules and assigns tasks to the agent\n(public functionary) so that he or she can provide services to the client (an\nordinary citizen). The agent, however, has informational advantages over the\nprincipal  and  thus  has  the  propensity  to  behave  dishonestly  (Besley  and\nMcLaren 1993).\n\nThe principal can make corruption endogenous to the model and take\nvarious  actions  to  control  the  agent\u2019s  behavior.  But  these  actions  may  be\nineffective (as they have often been shown to be) and involve costs of detection,\npunishment,14 and reform (downsizing), and thus the principal may face the\nrisk of market failure (Acemoglu and Verdier 2000). For example, it may not\nbe possible for the principal to write contracts contingent on the agent\u2019s quality\nor contracts that specify the agent\u2019s level of effort (Furubotn and Richter 1998).\nEven paying the agent \u201cinformation rent\u201d (in the form of a residual claim on\nthe operation) is not a powerful incentive (Furubotn and Richter 1998), which\nis not to say that such a process will suffer from computational difficulties\n(Moe 1984). Similarly, appointing an auditor may also be fruitless, as there is\nscope for collusion between the auditor and the agent.\n\n14 For more details, see Klitgaard (1988), Kofman and Lawaree (1996), Laffont and Tirole (1993),\n\nOlsen and Torsvik (1998), and Strausz (1995).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n252\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fThe Quality of Public Sector Management and Economic Inequality\n\n253\n\nNo matter what actions a principal takes, the burden of all actions falls on\nwelfare and distribution. For example, in tax payment, some clients may collude\nwith the agent and evade tax by bribing; as a result, other clients are likely to pay\nmore  tax,  which  now  implicitly  becomes  the  price  of  honesty  (Hart  1970).\nMoreover, problems of the agency relationship result in inappropriate investment\nin  public  sector  projects  and  ineffective  policies  (Frisch  1999  and  Klitgaard\n1988). Whatever the case\u2014whether the principal (government) is able to control\nthe behavior of its  agents at a high cost or whether agents extract money from\nthe  clients  (the  public)\u2014the  cost  is  diverted  toward  the  poor15  and  the\ndistribution of income favors the powerful groups in the society.\nHypothesis 4 (H4): When corruption is endemic in the public sector, the rich get\nthe greater share of income, evade taxes, and enjoy higher levels of public services,\nand, as a result, disparity increases.\n\nEmpirical Strategy\n\nThe discussion so far illustrates the widening distribution gap resulting\nfrom decreasing efficiency in the quality of public sector management. Testing\nthis hypothesis longitudinally gives a better picture as changes in the quality\nof public administration over time are better able to explain the variation in\nincome distribution (if any), and tracing the trajectory enables researchers to\nidentify significant factors. However, since little data are available\u2014especially\ndata  on  the  quality  of  public  sector  management\u2014for  analyzing  the\nphenomenon in a time dimension, the study uses cross-sectional data.16 Thus,\nthe study tests the hypothesis: Can variations across countries in one dimension\nof the quality of public sector management explain variations in economic\ninequality across countries?\n\nThe study uses three techniques to test the hypotheses. First, the data are\ndivided into five main groups17 on the basis of gross national product (GNP)\nper capita: low income (GNP per capita of $765 or less in 1995), lower-middle\n\n15\n\n16\n\n Many studies have shown that corruption functions as an indirect tax and is regressive in nature\u2014\nthe poor pay more as a share of income than the rich. In addition, in a corrupt environment indirect\ntaxes are more depended upon than direct taxes (progressive in nature) and a higher share of indirect\ntaxes shifts the burden toward the lower-income groups. For more details, see Wei and Kaufmann\n(1999).\n\nIndeed, the cross-section data change the way a hypothesis under test is worded and tested. If one\nuses time-series data, the hypothesis will be worded thus: \u201cvariation in variable X over time explains\nvariation in variable Y over time.\u201d However, when cross-section data are used, the same hypothesis\nbecomes: \u201cvariation in variable X across sectors (countries, individuals, firms, etc.) can explain variation\nin variable Y across sectors (countries, individuals, firms, etc.).\u201d\n\n17 This  classification  is  based  on  the  World  Bank\u2019s  classification  of  countries;  for  more  details,  see:\n\nhttp://www.worldbank.org/depweb/english/beyond/global/classification.html.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n253\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f254\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nincome ($766 to $3,035), upper-middle income ($3,036 to $9,385), high-\nincome Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)\ncountries ($9,386 or more), and high-income non-OECD countries ($9,386\nor more). Thereafter, means across the groups are compared to test whether\ncountries with high income inequality have low values for the quality of public\nsector management indicators.\n\nThen  correlation  (Pierson)  test  is  applied  to  the  data  to  measure  the\ndegree  of  correlation. The  two-tail  test  is  employed  to  test  the  statistical\nsignificance of the correlation coefficients. This technique essentially analyzes\nwhether two variables are moving in the same direction (direct relationship)\nor in the opposite direction (inverse relationship). The test also identifies the\ndegree of association; the value of the coefficient ranges from -1 to +1, where\n+1 shows perfect positive correlation, -1 indicates perfect negative correlation,\nand a value tending toward +1 or -1 shows strength of relationship.\n\nFinally, univariate regressions are calculated and a scattergram is plotted\nto test the causality, as the presence of correlation necessarily implies causality.\n\nData and Summary Statistics\n\nThe study uses three measures of inequality: Gini index for income or\nconsumption,  Gini  index  for  land  distribution,  and  Gini  index  for  the\ndistribution of number of years of education.18 The Gini index measures the\nextent to which the distribution of assets in a given percentage of the population\nwithin an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution.19 A Gini index\nof  zero  represents  perfect  equality,  while  an  index  of  one  implies  perfect\ninequality.  \u201cZero\u201d  and  \u201cone\u201d  are  theoretical  possibilities,  but  in  reality  the\nvalue lies between the two numbers.\n\nThe first measure of inequality (Gini index for income or consumption)\nmeasures how much the distribution of income or consumption within an\neconomy  deviates  from  a  perfectly  equal  distribution.20 To  measure  the\ndistribution of land in a country, the Gini index of land distribution is used;\nit captures the extent to which land distribution within an economy deviates\nfrom a perfectly equal distribution. The third distribution variable covers the\ndistribution of the number of years of education across the population.

All\nthe four indices are based on data collected through many surveys among\ncountry experts, exporters, and companies doing business in countries. The\nindices  have  a  value  of  -2.5  to  +2.5,  where  -2.5  shows  the  lowest  level  of\nquality of public sector management and +2.5 shows the highest level of quality,\nand figures in between show a tendency toward a certain quality.\n\nTable 1 shows the summary (mean, standard deviation, maximum and\n\nminimum values of the indices) statistics of the data.\n\nTable 1: Summary Statistics\n\nIndicator\nGini Coefficient\nLand Gini\nEducation Gini\nGovernment Effectiveness\nRegulation Quality\nRule of Law\nControl of Corruption\n\nMean\n0.3881\n0.6050\n0.3526\n7.484E-02\n7.381E-02\n- 4.1587E-02\n1.008E-02\n\nStd.

The upper\nleft  corner  shows  that  the  Gini  index  has  a  negative  relationship  with\ngovernment effectiveness (coefficient of government effectiveness is -0.04 and\nR2  is  0.14).  The  relationship  is  statistically  significant,  as  most  of  the\nobservations lie around the regression line; the relationship is economically\nmeaningful, as the higher the effectiveness of the government, the lower is the\nincome or consumption inequality. Thus, the regression results are unable to\nreject H1. When the Gini index is regressed against regulation quality, the\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n257\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f258\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nsame relationship is observed in the data. While the relationship is significant\n(coefficient is -0.03, R2 is 0.07), the relationship is not strong, as depicted by\nthe low R2 value.\n\nThe results show that rule of law significantly affects the distribution\nof  income  or  consumption  (coefficient  is  -0.04  and  R2  is  0.12).  The\nrelationship is meaningful, as it is shown that the stronger the rule of law,\nthe better able the people are to establish a business and live safe lives, and\nall groups to benefit equally from public services. Thus, the study is unable\nto reject H3.\n\nFigure 1 also shows that there is a visible pattern between control of\ncorruption and inequality (coefficient is -0.04 and R2 is 0.10); also seen is the\nfact that control of corruption in the public sector can improve the distribution\nof income or consumption. This provides support for H4, proving that in the\npresence of corrupt public functionaries, the powerless and poor groups have\nto suffer more than the powerful and richer groups, and that, consequently,\ninequality increases.\n\nFigure 1: Income Inequality and Quality of Public Sector Management\n\n- 1.00\n\n0.00\n\n1.00\n\n2.00\n\n- 2.00\n\n- 1.00\n\n0.00\n\n1.00\n\n2.00\n\nControl of

There is another important reason for this analysis:\nin most countries, basic education is the responsibility of the public sector\nand the quality of the public sector is directly depicted in the management of\nthe education service. Figure 3 shows the relationship between the distribution\nof the number of years of schooling and the four dimensions of public sector\nmanagement quality.\n\nThe upper left corner shows that there is a significant relationship between\nthe two variables: coefficient is -0.06 and R2 is 0.07. The coefficient has a\nhigh value and the results support H1. An interpretation of the results shows\nthat as government effectiveness increases, years of education are distributed\nmore evenly among the population. The upper right corner shows the same\nresults for regulation quality and education Gini, and therefore the study is\nunable to reject H2.

of Public Sector Management and Economic Inequality\n\n261\n\nof the fact that the results are not totally unambiguous, it is concluded that on\nthe basis of the data available and the methodology adopted, there appears to\nbe a significant relationship between the quality of public sector management\nand economic inequality.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe impact of the state\u2019s involvement in economic activity has long been\na matter of heated debate, with convincing arguments on both sides. However,\ngrowing  concerns  in  the  area  of  market  failure,  such  as  externalities\nmanagement, distributional concerns, and provision of social services, have\nincreasingly received the attention of policy makers. Among the areas where\nthe market has failed to provide a remedy is the distribution of economic\nassets  and  income.  While  it  is  widely  supported  that  the  government  is\nresponsible for controlling (and alleviating) poverty, as well as the growing\ninequality between and among socioeconomic groups, the issues covered under\nthe broad question, How does the quality of public sector management affect\neconomic inequality?, have not been addressed.\n\nThis study argues that the quality of public sector management itself\ndetermines  the  distributional  outcomes.  As  public  policy  evolves  and  is\nimplemented by the public sector, any inherited or acquired weaknesses in\nthe policy process are reflected in the distribution of public services, collection\nof taxes, and allocation of expenditures. Four hypotheses have been formulated\nwith regard to the routes through which public policy creates distributional\ndistortions:\n\n(cid:127) As the quality of public services deteriorates and bureaucracy becomes\ninefficient, some groups (generally, low-income) have decreasing access\nto public services while other groups (from the high-income bracket)\nproportionally enjoy more public services; this, in the long run, leads\nto an increase in inequality.\n\n(cid:127) Excessive  government  intervention  in  markets  through  market-\nunfriendly  policies  results  in  market  weakness  and  the  exclusion\nlow  income  groups  from  businesses  and  consequently  inequality\nincreases.\n\n(cid:127) Weak rule of law makes low-income groups vulnerable to law-and-\norder problems and inefficient dispute resolution limits their ability\nto  invest  in  and  operate  businesses;  thus,  too,  economic  disparity\nwidens.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n261\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f262\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\n(cid:127) High rates of corruption in the public sector result in limited access\nto services with the result that the poor pay a much higher price of\ncorruption than the rich; the result of this is high inequality.\n\nData on income or consumption inequality, land distribution inequality,\nand distribution of years of educational attainment are used as proxies for\ninequality  and  the  quality  of  public  sector  management  is  measured  from\nfour different angles: overall public sector effectiveness, extent to which public\nsector interferes unnecessarily in markets (regulation quality), rule of law, and\ncontrol of corruption in the public sector.\n\nThe relationship is tested by three methods: mean-comparison within\ndata  (divided  on  the  bases  of  income),  Pierson  correlation  analysis,  and\nunivariate linear regression analysis. All the three methods provide enough\nevidence to conclude that the quality of public sector management has a strong\nbearing on economic inequality. These results, however, are significant in the\ncase  of  income  or  consumption  inequality  and  education-years  inequality,\nwhile in the case of land distribution inequality the results lose significance.\nVariation in the level of inequality is explained by variation in the quality of\npublic sector management across geographical and national boundaries.\n\nThe study addresses the question whether or not the quality of public\nsector  management  affects  economic  inequality.  Even  though  the  results\ngathered by the study are not completely unambiguous, on the basis of the\ndata available and the methodology used in the study it can be concluded that\nthe quality of public sector institutions has a bearing on economic inequality.\nThe results support the four hypotheses formulated in the study. While\ntwo measures\u2014income or consumption inequality and distribution of years\nof schooling\u2014are affected by the quality of public sector management, the\ndistribution of land does not appear to be so affected (by the quality of public\nsector institutions).\n\nAll the same, in spite of the results of this study, more research is required\non this issue, particularly on the methods of analysis, model specification,\nand causality. Research is also necessary on the channels through which the\nquality  of  public  sector  management  affects  economic  inequality.  Richer\nmeasures of the pubic sector expenditure allocation framework need to be\ndeveloped. Furthermore, as these results conform to only a few studies dealing\nwith  the  impact  of  institutional  settings  of  growth  and  development,  the\nconfiguration of the appropriate type of public sector management institutions,\npublic policy formulation and implementation processes, and poverty and\ninequality  created  by  public  sector  need  to  be  brought  to  the  forefront  of\ndevelopment economics and the public sector reform agenda.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n262\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fThe Quality of Public Sector Management and Economic Inequality\n\n263\n\nReferences\n\nAcemoglu, D., and T.

Gonzalez1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAccommodating  diversity  in  public  management  means  making  sure\npublic services are provided in equal and nondiscriminatory ways. Providing\nservices that are efficient, effective, culturally sensitive, and equal and that\nvalue equality and diversity can help to improve service quality and meet the\nneeds of diverse citizens.\n\nIn this paper, diversity is defined as any collective mixture of people set\napart by similarities and differences. The focus is on acceptance of and respect\nfor  the  uniqueness  of  all  groups,  and  the  primary  need,  from  a  public\nmanagement point of view, is for governance systems to embrace differences\nand avoid mutual accommodation.\n\nFor  many countries, diversity is a national treasure and is sometimes\ncelebrated.  It  is  expressed  most  notably  in  culture,  arts,  music,  folklore,\nliterature, and skills practiced by different ethnic groups, which, over periods\nof cohabitation, created what has become the national distinctiveness of the\ncountries where they live (Anyaoku n.d.). Like biodiversity, it embodies the\nvariety of cultures in a systemic perspective where each culture evolves through\ncontact with other cultures. That suggests that diversity requires dialogue and\nsharing of values (Kiyindou 2005).\n\nBut in many countries, including the Philippines, managing diversity is\nstill  a  difficult  test  for  national  governance.  If  managed  unconstructively  or\npoorly,  diversity  can  quickly  lead  to  instability  within  states,  triggering  civil\nconflict that takes development the wrong way (UNDP 2004, Anyaoku n.d.).\nYet, despite turning out ethnic fault lines, diversity itself cannot be traded off\njust to keep the peace. There is no evidence to suggest that cultural differences\u2014\nwhen  ethnic  groups  are  at  odds  over  values\u2014are  the  root  cause  of  violent\ndisagreements (UNDP 2004). What is apparent is that if unconstructive diversity\nmanagement is not addressed, it will increase the social costs of discrimination,\nsegregation, and marginalization of certain groups. Society pays a high price\n\n1\n\nPresident, Development Academy of the Philippines.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n271\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f272\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nthrough increased punitive expenditures and greater public outlays to keep social\nintegration from completely falling apart (Laubeov\u00e1 2001).\n\nIndeed, the good governance case for diversity indicates this can help to\nenhance the potential, creativity, and contribution of people from different\nbackgrounds  to  provide  more  efficient  and  responsive  services.  Thus,\nrecognizing  diversity  is  important,  but  not  important  enough  on  its  own.\nGovernment, business, and civil society must invest in diversity, managing it\neffectively and efficiently so that it is embedded in the fabric of the country\u2019s\nlaws and institutions.\n\nIn Praise of Diversity Management\n\nManaging diversity is a wide-ranging governance process of developing\nan environment that works for all groups. This process takes into account the\nneed to change organization systems to sustain the ability of government and\nother  stakeholders  to  get  from  all  groups  the  potential  contributions  they\nhave to offer. It requires a pluralist system that holds within it groups differing\nin basic background experiences and cultures. It allows for the development\nof common practices, while preserving the right of each group to maintain its\ncultural heritage (MPA 2005). Recognizing and respecting peoples\u2019 differences\nand similarities helps government understand ethnic groups better and improve\nits ability to deliver innovative and creative solutions. It enables government,\nwhether national or local, to build teams with a unique range of capabilities\nthat can win the trust of various disadvantaged groups. From the point of\nview of these groups, a well-managed diverse setting increases the available\nrange of options and freedom of choices for citizens, encourages a healthy\ncompetition between different ideas and ways of life, thereby preventing the\nascendancy of one culture over the other, engenders tolerance and respect for\ndifferent cultures, and creates a climate in which different cultures can have a\nmutually beneficial dialogue and collaborate on commonly agreed national\ngoals and vision (Jemiai 2001).\n\nIt is important in a diverse environment that competition for political\npower, which is a normal part of every governance system, can be articulated\nin such a way as to avoid \u201cethnicization,\u201d a situation where all initiatives and\ndecisions are read in ethnic terms and only in ethnic terms. In such situations,\naccording  to  Sch\u00f6pflin  (2001),  the  public  good  character  of  diversity\nmanagement is lost since the decisions do not transcend ethnicities. What\nethnicization does is to legitimize institutional arrangements which\u2014though\nformally democratic\u2014promote ethnicity-based majority rule in multiethnic\ncontexts. This culture revolves around an intolerant ethical preference for the\nparticular collective good of a specific (majority) group. The outcome is to\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n272\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fManaging Diversity in the Philippines\n\n273\n\ndivide  people  along  ethnic  lines,  since  the  partiality  of  the  state  creates\nopportunity for exclusionary inequality (Dimitrijevi\u00e7 and Kovacs 2004).\n\nConventional government thinking has tended to ignore diversity as a\ncritical variable in the development process for a good reason: diversity brings\nuncertainty and distortions to a stylized planning process. But if development\nis a holistic process, it must factor in diversity, or face the prospect of a systemic\nfailure. The new approach ought to be inclusive, all the more because current\nthinking  also  requires  harmonization  with  the  calls  for  participation,\ntransparency, accountability, and democratization\u2014all of which, paradoxically,\nhave pronounced inexact dimensions.\n\nThe Need for Non-discriminating Public Policies\n\nThe  key  to  successful  diversity  management  is  to  ensure  that  public\npolicies and decisions are based on objective criteria, and not on unlawful\ndiscrimination, prejudice, or unfair assumptions. A state adhering to these\nassumptions is expected to have accumulated a good deal of nondiscriminatory\nlaws  and  jurisprudence  and,  to  a  certain  extent,  to  have  followed  what\ninternational  conventions  require:  recognizing  cultural  differences  in  its\nconstitution  and  legislating  policies  to  advance  the  interests  of  particular\ngroups\u2014especially historically marginalized minorities. In the Philippines,\nthe  latter  is  typified  by  the  Indigenous  Peoples\u2019  Rights  Act  and  other\nenvironmental  regulations  on  ancestral  domain.  The  country\u2019s  policy\ninterventions that aim to reduce economic and social exclusion must help\nprevent or end violent conflict. Policies of multicultural accommodation, if\npracticed, must also improve state capacity and promote social harmony.\n\nGood governance that is culturally sensitive is often upheld by formal\nlegal recognition of customs and mores or customary law, despite the fact that\nthey may compete with the formal legal system of the state. In this case, the\ngovernment offers, through legal and extralegal means, considerable latitude\nand  space  to  resolve  disputes  when  norms  of  unwritten  customary  law  go\nagainst the country\u2019s legal system, or when the application of the country\u2019s\nlaws entails a destruction of community norms and customs (Stavenhagen\n2005). Legal pluralism is resisted by those who fear that it chips away at the\nprinciple of a unified legal system or that it would uphold traditional practices\nopposed to democracy and human rights. There are real trade-offs societies\nmust face, but legal pluralism does not require the wholesale adoption of all\ntraditional practices. Accommodating customary law should not be an excuse\nto preserve practices that violate human rights, no matter how \u201ctraditional\u201d\nor \u201cauthentic\u201d they may happen to be (UNDP 2004).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n273\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f274\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nFocus on Indigenous Peoples\n\nTo date, little attention has been given to ascertaining whether Philippine\npublic management reflects ethnic diversity and takes on broad issues such as\nethnicity, language, culture, religious beliefs, and customs. This paper examines\nwhether the Philippines has been on track in managing diversity, especially\nwith  respect  to  indigenous  peoples.  Indigenous  groups  living  in  socially\ndisadvantaged,  remote,  or  rural  communities  have  serious  difficulty  in\nparticipating in the policy process compared with others and may be more\ndisempowered. They continue to have unacceptably low levels of education\nand employment, and are in situations of real poverty\u2014in part a consequence\nof their being subjected to unique forms of discrimination as service users.\n\nFollowing the Asian Development Bank\u2019s working definition, indigenous\npeoples are those with a social or cultural identity distinct from that of the\ndominant or mainstream society, a fact that makes them vulnerable to being\ndisadvantaged in the processes of development (Rovillos and Morales 2002).\nIndigenous peoples are kinship-based. They have attempted to maintain local\nself-sufficiency, and resist assimilation. Almost without exception, they have\nbeen regarded as backward and inconvenient by nation-states, and have been\ndecimated,  dispossessed,  or  forced  to  assimilate  in  the  process  of  nation\nbuilding. As small, nonhierarchical societies, indigenous peoples do not have\nthe  bureaucratic  institutions,  strong  centralized  leadership,  and  power  of\norganized government (Barsh n.d.). They are rarely included in present-day\nnational decision making. Indigenous organizations may claim the right to\npolitically represent indigenous peoples at the national level, but this may or\nmay not be compatible with existing political structures (Stavenhagen 2005).\nBecause  of  the  indigenous  peoples\u2019  stewardship  of  their  natural\nenvironment, this has become the base of their identity as people and their\ndistinct collectivity. Indigenous governance systems are largely based on the\nprinciples of collective peaceful coexistence and consensus building in decision\nmaking. This indigenous worldview makes them distinct from the prevailing\npractice of managing resources (Carling 2005). Government agencies allocate\nresource use rights to forest concessionaires and mining interests, often ignoring\ncommunity claims to land and forests (Perrot-Ma\u00eetre and Ellsworth 2003).\nFrom occupying most of the earth\u2019s ecosystems two centuries ago, indigenous\npeoples today have the legal right to use only a small fraction of each nation\u2019s\nterritory. In many cases the rights are partial or qualified (UNDP 2004).\n\nYet all people benefit from cultural diversity. Indigenous peoples have,\nover  time,  important  sources  of  ecological  information.  Revitalizing  this\nknowledge helps to improve food security, raise household incomes, and foster\nself-esteem (IFAD n.d.). Today, they are a reservoir of human cultural, artistic,\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n274\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fManaging Diversity in the Philippines\n\n275\n\nand  social  possibilities,  the  economic  value  of  which  is  suggested  by  the\nemerging  global  market  for  indigenous  peoples\u2019  art,  designs,  music,  and\nfolklore.  Likewise,  their  indigenous  ways  are  a  rich  source  of  models  of\nalternative social structures and institutions in indigenous cultures (Barsh n.d.).\nIn  the  Philippines,  about  140  indigenous  ethno-linguistic  groups,\nrepresenting 15\u201320% of the total population of 80 million, are present in more\nthan  50  of  the  country\u2019s  78  provinces. They  have  continuously  lived  as\ncommunities  in  communally  bounded  and  defined  territories,  which  they\noccupied long before European colonization (Stavenhagen 2003). Until recently,\nthese people have had little security of tenure over their ancestral lands.\n\nTable 1: Location of Indigenous Peoples of the Philippines\n\nRegion\nCAR\nRegion II\nRegion X\nRegion XI\nCaraga\n\nIndigenous\nPopulation1\n1,252,962\n1,014,955\n1,470,296\n2,107,285\n874,456\n\nTotal Regional\nPopulation2\n1,254,838\n2,536,035\n2,463,272\n4,604,158\n1,942,667\n\nProportion of\nIndigenous in\nRegional Population\n(%)\n99.9\n40.0\n59.7\n45.8\n45.0\n\nProportion of\nRegional Pop.\nin National Total\n(%)\n1.8\n3.7\n3.6\n6.7\n2.8\n\nSources of basic data: Total population, NSO (1995); Estimated IP population, Office of Northern Cultural Communities\n(ONCC)  and Office of Southern Cultural Communities (OSCC) (1989), cited in IBON Facts and Figures, vol. 24, no. 7,\n15 April 2001.\n\nFigure 1: Indigenous Peoples of the Philippines\n\nIgorots (Cordillera peoples)\nIsneg\nItneg\nKalinga\nBalangaw\n\nBontok\nKankanai\nIfugao\nIbaloi\n\nIkalahan\nGaddang\n\nMangyan of Mindoro\nAlangan\nTao-Buhid\nRatagnon\nIraya\nBangon\nHanunnuo\n\nGubatnon\nTadyawan\n\nPalawan Peoples\nTagbanwa\nBatak\nMoros (Jama, Mapun, Palawani, Malbog)\n\nAeta and scattered groups\nIlongot\nAtta\nAgta\nDumagat\n\nAta\nSulod\nBukidnon\nMagahat\nKorolanos of Negros\nAti\n\nMoro peoples\nKaraga\nSangil\nMaranao\nIlanun\nMagindanao\n\nYakan\nSamal\nBadjau\nTausug\nKalibugan\n\nLumads of Mindanao\nMamanwa\nTagkaolo\nHigaonon\nBanwaon\nManobo\nDibabawon\nBukidnon\nBagobo\nMandaya\nMansaka\nKaraga\n\nKaagan\nSarangani\nTiruray\nKalagan\nTalaandig\nTasaday\nSanduka\nTboli\nUbo\nB\u2019laan\nSubanen\n\nSource: Many Islands, Many Peoples \u00a9 Survival 1998.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n275\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f276\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nTable 1 shows the location of indigenous peoples in the Philippines and\ntheir share in subnational populations. Figure 1 shows their distribution by\nmajor indigenous grouping. The northern mountain ranges of the Cordillera\nare  the  ancestral  homeland  of  the  Igorots.  Lowland  indigenous  groups,\nprincipally the Aetas, inhabit the other regions in Luzon. Mangyan groups\nthrive in the island of Mindoro. There are at least 13 Islamized ethno-linguistic\ngroups and 18 other groups indigenous to Mindanao. The introduction of\nIslam split the peoples of Mindanao into two distinct categories, Moros and\nLumads. Those who adopted Islam became the Moros and those who did not\nbecame the Lumads (from a Visayan term that means \u201cborn of the earth\u201d)\n(Rovillos and Morales 2002).\n\nEthnic minorities and indigenous people are the poorest groups in the\nPhilippines.  They  have  shorter  life  expectancies  and  lower  educational\nattainments. Public spending on basic social services systematically discriminates\nagainst them\u2014a result of lower financial allocations or of distance. Indigenous\npeople receive fewer health-care inputs and have worse health outcomes than\nthe average population. Studies have shown high levels of infant mortality, lower-\nthan-average nutritional levels, difficulty of access to social welfare institutions,\nand  lower-than-average  delivery  of  the  services  provided  by  government\ninstitutions (Stavenhagen 2005).

They have put into question its ability to provide social\nand  economic  services  that  are  efficient,  effective,  culturally  sensitive,  and\nequal and that value diversity.\n\nIn the past, paternalistic development schemes often tried to assimilate\nindigenous  peoples  into  mainstream  cultures.  Not  only  were  these  efforts\nunwelcome, they were unsuccessful. Philippine laws that were passed assumed\nhomogeneity  among  Filipinos.  National  programs  in  education,  health,\nenvironmental protection and agriculture, paid no attention to variations in\nvalues, institutions, and culture. Resentment among indigenous communities\nwas rooted in the contradiction between traditional practices and the national\nlaw as regards landownership, utilization of natural resources, and crime and\ndispute settlement (Laya 2001).\n\nThere was also a widely held perception that allowing diversity could\nweaken the state, lead to conflict, and curb progress. The best approach to\ndiversity,  in  this  view,  was  assimilation  around  a  single  national  standard,\nwhich requires the suppression of cultural identities (UNDP 2004). Even to\nwell-meaning decision makers, diversity came to be identified with disparity\n(Kiyindou 2005).\n\nThere is, of course, an important area that the state tended to emphasize\nat the expense of guaranteeing equality for indigenous peoples. Philippine\nlaws have a distinct bias for individual rights\u2014equal for all Filipino citizens\u2014\n\nFigure 2: Educational Attainment\nof Indigenous Peoples\n\n46%\n\nelementary\nsecondary\ncollege undergrad\ncollege grad\npostgrad\nno educ\n\n18%\n\n0.46%\n\n2%\n\n7%\n\n19%\n\nSource: Census of Population and Housing 2000.

It failed to recognize\ncollective rights. According to Stavenhagen (2003), states think there must be\na general law for everyone and nothing special about indigenous people. But\nindigenous  peoples  argue  rightly  that  their  survival  depends  on  a  cultural\nfactor: a specific and special relationship to the land and to the resources of\nthe land. Likewise, all too often law and policy have unreservedly presumed\nthat all Filipinos think and respond to stimuli in the same way as the policy\nmakers and central government officials do\u2014as educated, lowland Christian\nFilipinos.  The  assumption  is  obviously  wrong  and  provides  fodder  for\nmisunderstanding among majority group Filipinos and the Muslim Filipinos,\nthe  Cordillerans,  and  other  traditional  societies  (Laya  2001).  Formal  and\nlegalistic  remedies  based  on  wrong  assumptions  do  not  bridge\nmisunderstandings and bring people together; they do little to heal the wounds\nthat have led to outright conflagration in areas such as Mindanao (Colleta,\nGhee, and Kelles-Viitanen 2001).\n\nThe Philippines has ratified Convention 169 of the International Labour\nOrganization, adopted in 1989, which calls on states to respect indigenous\nlands and territories and proclaims the right of indigenous people to control\ntheir natural resources. Yet while one Philippine law could recognize the rights\nof  indigenous  people  over  their  lands,  other  laws  could  make  it  hard  for\nindigenous communities to protect their ancestral claims. In many instances\ntransnational corporations unleash conflicts by coveting resources for minerals,\noil deposits, and even patentable forest products. Or, as Stavenhagen (2003)\npoints out, even when there are court cases decided in favor of indigenous\npeople, the authorities sometimes refuse to comply.\n\nThus, the ambiguous Philippine record regarding diversity was set early,\nand has continued with intriguing contradictions ever since. On the one hand,\nthe  Philippine  Government  has  pioneered  in  positive  steps  to  integrate\nminorities peacefully and offer them articulated civic rights; on the other hand,\nit has repressed their varied traditions and threatened their autonomy in terms\nof both property and civil rights. This is a case where the basic problem of\nstructural discrimination is not only not being resolved, but state policy cannot\neven  tell  the  difference  (Laubeov\u00e1  2001). Yet\u2014to  paraphrase  Stavenhagen\n(2005)\u2014there  is  a  need  to  find  constructive  arrangements  between  the\nlegitimate  concerns  of  the  state  regarding  territorial  integrity  and  national\nunity, and the equally legitimate concerns of indigenous peoples regarding\ntheir collective rights within a system made up of laws and institutions that\nhave adverse consequences for them.\n\nFor  the  purposes  of  this  paper,  it  is  best  to  see  constructive  diversity\nmanagement in the Philippines as multidimensional, the achievement of which\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n278\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fManaging Diversity in the Philippines\n\n279\n\nrequires legal, institutional, and practical ways of formulating and carrying\nout policies. Rectifying exclusion requires a combination of policies, including\naddressing  unequal  social  investments  to  achieve  equality  of  opportunity,\nacknowledging legitimate collective claims to land and livelihoods, and taking\naffirmative action in favor of disadvantaged groups (UNDP 2004). A recent\ndevelopment that creates opportunities for indigenous peoples to move forward\nis  decentralization.  Local  governments  in  the  Philippines  can  play  more\nsignificant roles in empowering indigenous groups. This shift could result in\nbetter outcomes, since delivering services to disadvantaged groups is more\ncost-effective at the local level.\n\nIn general, national laws and policies have to be adjusted in ways that\nmore rewardingly take into account these myriad issues, offering indigenous\npeoples  ample  stakes  in  the  flows  of  resources,  land  utilization,  and  job\nrationing. According to UNDP (2004), legal and policy measures must include\nexplicit  recognition  of  indigenous  peoples\u2019  rights  over  their  physical  and\nintellectual  property,  informed  consent  for  access  to  ancestral  lands  and\nindigenous knowledge, and equitable sharing of benefits. Cultural expressions\nand community-based rights must be placed under state protection. In the\nend, corrective action is about giving a wide range of participatory choices to\nindigenous groups within a pluralist governance system.\n\nLegal Recognition and Support\n\nSince legislation is the main avenue for protecting rights and promoting\nequality, this section examines whether a recently passed law, the Indigenous\nPeoples\u2019 Rights Act, has been helpful in bringing about public management\nchanges,  for  example,  legal  acceptance  of  indigenous  institutions  such  as\nancestral domain.\n\nTo begin with, indigenous communities are powerless to establish their\ncustomary claims without formal legitimacy or protection. They cannot define\nthe rules, as they have no knowledge of the limits of state power. They need to\nfit into state law to protect their interests. It is necessary for them to access\nstate law for the latter to recognize local ownership and identify those with\nrights to community property systems. Of course, clear legal recognition of\ncustomary  property  rights  is  not  sufficient  to  guarantee  good  resource\nmanagement, but it is a necessary condition. A legal framework for customary\ntenure is an enabling tool that can supply legal space for indigenous ownership\nregimes and offer a level playing field (Ellsworth and White 2003).\n\nThe legal basis for indigenous peoples\u2019 right to participate meaningfully\nin  natural  resource  management  has  been  established  in  international\nagreements including the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development,\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n279\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f280\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nthe  International  Convention  on  the  Elimination  of  All  Forms  of  Racial\nDiscrimination, ILO Convention 169, Agenda 21, the OAS Declaration on\nthe Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the UN Draft Declaration on the Rights of\nIndigenous Peoples, and the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. These\ndeclarations explicitly recognize indigenous land rights, traditional resource\nmanagement, equal rights to participate in public affairs, the need to protect\nindigenous lands from environmental threats, and the need for prior informed\nconsent  of  indigenous  peoples  before  decisions  affecting  their  rights  and\ninterests are made (Downing et al. 2002).\n\nA  turn-of-the-20th-century  case  showed  that  the  king  of  Spain  had\nrecognized  indigenous  property  rights  in  the  Philippines  until  1894. This\ndiscovery led to the reversal of a legal doctrine affirming that all land in the\narchipelago belonged to the crown (or the government) (Perrot-Ma\u00eetre and\nEllsworth 2003). These rights were again recognized in 1909 in a unanimous\nopinion of the US Supreme Court written by Oliver Wendell Holmes. The\nUS colonial regime in Manila, however, suppressed the decision and for most\nof the 20th century, the colonial regime and the post-1946 Philippine Republic\nasserted a claim of public ownership over ancestral domains. Consequently,\nafter decades of struggle for legal redress concerning ancient land rights, the\nIndigenous Peoples\u2019 Rights Act (IPRA) was passed by the Philippine Congress\nin 1997. It marked the first time that a state in Asia explicitly recognized the\nrights of indigenous peoples to their ancestral domain,2 to self-determination,\nand to the free exercise of their culture (UNDP 2004).\n\nThe IPRA now constitutes the principal framework, after the Philippine\nConstitution,3 in which indigenous rights must be considered. The act affirms\nthat native title is the main basis of the ancestral domain rights of indigenous\npeoples and offers the alternative of applying for a certificate of ancestral domain\ntitle,  which  formally  acknowledges  such  rights.  It  respects  and  recognizes\npolitical structures and systems, culture, resource management practices, and\nconflict settlement mechanisms that are indigenous. It mandates the delivery\n\n2\n\nIPRA  defines  ancestral  domain  as  all  areas  belonging  to  indigenous  cultural  communities  and\nindigenous people. This includes lands, inland waters, and coastal areas occupied or possessed by\nindigenous people since time immemorial. The right remains even when war, force majeure, deceit,\nor government projects interrupt the possession. Ancestral domain also includes forests, pastures,\nburial grounds, worship areas, and mineral and other resources no longer exclusively occupied and\nused by indigenous peoples but to which they had access for their subsistence and traditional activities.\nThis provision clearly recognizes the essential connection of indigenous cultures and traditions with\nthe land (UNDP 2004).\n\n3 The  1987  Constitution  recognizes  \u201cthe  rights  of  indigenous  cultural  communities  within  the\nframework of national unity and development\u201d and the creation of autonomous regions in Muslim\nMindanao and in the Cordillera.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n280\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fManaging Diversity in the Philippines\n\n281\n\nof basic services to indigenous communities and provides for their holistic\nand  integrated  development.  It  provides  for  the  indigenous  peoples\u2019  self-\ndelineation of ancestral domains and ancestral lands (Bennagen 2000). It even\nrequires  that  communities  be  informed  and  consulted  before  any  mining\nconcessions or other projects are started (Perrot-Ma\u00eetre and Ellsworth 2003).\nThe IPRA also provides that indigenous peoples can \u201creceive just and fair\ncompensation  for  any  damages  to  their  lands  sustained  as  a  result  of\ndevelopment projects.\u201d Full compensation is also available for loss or injury\nresulting from relocation. These provisions suggest that damages are designed\nto be \u201crestorative\u201d rather than punitive (Hughes 2000).\n\nThe certificate of ancestral domain title (CADT) is considered by many\nto  be  a  step  forward  for  more  secure  community  property  rights.  As  of\nDecember 2004, the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP)\nhad awarded CADTs to 150,000 indigenous beneficiaries covering 604,000\nhectares  (NCIP  Web  site). The  recipients,  mostly  residing  in  Mindanao,\nCagayan Valley, and Bicol, constitute a tiny proportion of the total indigenous\npopulation of about 12\u201315 million. Also, claims that had been issued through\nformer environment programs under the Department of Environment and\nNatural Resources were to be converted to titles (LRCKSK/Friends of the\nEarth Philippines n.d.).\n\nThe story of the Calamian Tagbanwa of Coron Island demonstrates\nthat  the  rights-based  approach  through  IPRA  does  indeed  provide  legal\nguarantees over land, resources, culture, and life (Ferrari and de Vera 2004).\nCoron  Island  in  northern  Palawan  is  surrounded  by  waters  once  rich  in\nmarine resources, the Tagbanwa\u2019s main source of livelihood. By the mid-\n1980s, the Tagbanwa were facing food shortages, the result of encroachment\nby  migrant  fishers,  dynamite  fishing,  tourism  entrepreneurs,  politicians\nseeking land deals, and government agencies interested in controlling various\nresources  of  the  island. Through  the  use  of  an  executive  order  passed  in\n1993 that allowed the Department of Environment and Natural Resources\n(DENR) to issue Certificates of Ancestral Domain Claims (CADCs), and\nthe  assistance  of  a  national  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  (the\nPhilippine Association for Intercultural Development), in 1998 the Tagbanwa\nmanaged to obtain the first CADC in the country that included both land\nand  marine  waters,  for  a  total  of  22,284  hectares. They  produced  high-\nquality  maps  of  their  territories  and  an  Ancestral  Domain  Sustainable\nManagement Plan. In early 2001, the group successfully invoked IPRA to\nobtain a CADT. The CADT implies that the Tagbanwa are now in control\nof decisions concerning the use and sustainable management of the island\u2019s\nresources (Ferrari 2002). \n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n281\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f282\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nThis shows that in the current legislative and political context of the\nPhilippines, an indigenous community that is steadfast in its effort to secure\nits rights can invoke a legal framework that supports its claims, and when\nbacked by NGOs, can take effective action to obtain recognition of existing\nrights and protect local ecosystems (Ferrari and de Vera 2004). Despite the\nlegal  breakthrough,  however,  IPRA  has  weak  spots. The  act  merely  grants\nindigenous people priority use rights over ancestral domains. Since local people\nare accountable under the law for managing resources, it imposes a potentially\ncostly  burden.  Likewise,  indigenous  communities  are  still  subject  to  the\noversight and decisions of local government and the DENR (Perrot-Ma\u00eetre\nand Ellsworth 2003). This and the fact that other laws (such as the Mining\nAct  of  1995)  are  still  operative  mean  that  mining  interests  remain  a  large\nthreat to effective tenure security. Despite legal safeguards such as those referring\nto free, prior, and informed consent, or environmental impact and assessment\nstudies,  indigenous  peoples  report  that  powerful  economic  and  political\ninterests prevail over their legitimate rights (Stavenhagen 2003). The 1987\nPhilippine  Constitution  also  retained  the  Regalian  doctrine.  Its  premise  is\nthat all natural resources in the Philippines belong to the state and that private\nownership of title must therefore emanate from the state. All land not covered\nby official documentary certificates of title is thus presumed to be owned by\nthe Republic of the Philippines (Cari\u00f1o 2001). Even the Supreme Court, in a\ndecision  in  2000  that  quashed  legal  challenges  to  the  IPRA,  merely  gave\nindigenous peoples surface rights over their ancestral domains (Rovillos and\nMorales 2002). This may lead to contradictory or ambiguous interpretations\nthat do not fully favor indigenous rights.\n\nIn the end, the major concern seems to be not so much the text of the\nlaw  itself  as  the  difficulties  of  its  implementation,  primarily  because  of\nbureaucratic inadequacies and the discriminatory behavior of politicians and\ncivil  servants  (UNDP  2004).  Also  apparent  is  the  lack  of  organizational\ninfrastructure  and  specific  enabling  rules  within  governmental  agencies\nresponsible for interacting with indigenous communities (Perrot-Ma\u00eetre and\nEllsworth 2003). These issues appear to be a challenge that must be met squarely\nby government agencies and the judiciary, as well as by civil society, if the\nobjectives of the act are to be effectively met. As Ellsworth and White (2003)\nobserve, even when a law or policy is in place that establishes community\ntenure rights, the processes for acquiring the official documents and exercising\nthose rights are often extremely cumbersome and bureaucratic. The political\nforces opposed to community rights often have sufficient political clout to\ncreate administrative procedures and bureaucratic hoops that make it almost\nimpossible for communities to obtain the rights.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n282\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fManaging Diversity in the Philippines\n\n283\n\nA range of other culturally sensitive legislative actions can be important\nprerequisites for providing equality of access and equality of participation for\ndisadvantaged ethnic minorities. Public recognition of customary law can help\ncreate a sense of inclusion. Recognizing the ability of indigenous people to be\ngoverned by their own laws is also denial of historic injustice\u2014and can be\ncentral to self-government by indigenous people (UNDP 2004).\n\nSome customary practices have been \u201caccommodated\u201d and have acquired\nthe force of law over time, coexisting alongside old systems of jurisprudence.\nPresidential  Decree  No.  1083,  the  Code  of  Muslim  Personal  Laws  of  the\nPhilippines, issued in 1977, acknowledged that Islamic practices differ from\nnational law. It covered marriage and divorce, matrimonial and family relations,\nsuccession and inheritance, and similar domestic matters and established shari\u2019a\ncircuit courts. The Muslim system of laws, the Cordillera peace pact system\n(bodong)  and  its  administration,  and  other  traditional  dispute  resolution\npractices are likewise recognized in Republic Act No. 8371 (Laya 2001).\n\n State policies are silent on other important customary practices, such as\ndress that is a visible marker of identity\u2014for example, the head scarf worn by\nsome Muslim women\u2014and can be seen as allowing (not suppressing) their\nuse. In other cases, policies of exclusion may be less direct and often unintended,\nas when the public calendar does not recognize a minority\u2019s religious holidays\n(UNDP 2004). The Philippines officially celebrates mostly Christian holidays\nbut  the  current  administration  has  declared  the  end  of  Ramadan  as  a\nnonworking holiday in recognition of a diverse population.\n\nPolicy gaps persist. The Philippines remains weak in successful multiple-\nlanguage  management,  for  example.  A  bilingual  (English  and  Tagalog)\neducation policy at least reduces exclusion and opens opportunities for children\nwhose mother tongue is Tagalog or Tagalog-based, since children learn best\nwhen they are taught in their native tongue. But there are scores of minority\nlanguages  in  the  Philippines  that  are  not  used  in  public  discourse. The\ndominant use of English creates a high hurdle between the political elite and\nethnic minorities. The use of English as the primary language of legal discourse\ndenies justice to those who have little or no facility in English. State policy\ndoes  not  provide  any  space  in  which  minority  languages  can  thrive.  An\nexception is the Book Publishing Industry Development Act of 1995, which\nauthorizes the development of indigenous authorship and translations into\nand from the various languages of the country (Laya 2001). Yet, as UNDP\n(2004) argues, in multilingual societies a multiple-language policy is the only\nway to ensure full democratic participation. Otherwise, much of a country\u2019s\npopulation can be excluded by an inability to speak the official language of\nthe state.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n283\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f284\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nThe Philippines still follows a traditional approach to basic education:\nequal education for all within a single national secular educational system.\nIndigenous people must be \u201cabsorbed\u201d into the national system, with a standard\ncurriculum. The nationwide use of the same curriculum and textbooks for\npublic  schools  has  endowed  most  Filipinos  with  the  same  educational\ndenominator, including \u201cnational\u201d values, history, and culture (Laya 2001).\nPartial policy relief was attained recently when Muslims in Mindanao won\nconcessions from the central Government over the implementation of madaris,\nwhich  prescribes  Arabic  and  Islamic  values  (DAP  2005).  But  for  the  rest,\nthere is no educational model respectful of their cultures and worldviews (this\nassumes, of course, that culture is not a frozen set of values and practices),\nadapted to local contexts, and useful as a tool that gives them the choice to\nenter the formal system or function effectively in their own communities or\nboth. Still, some progress is being made, albeit piecemeal. Laya (2001) points\nout  that  the  Department  of  Education  has  adopted  a  system  of  multiple\ntextbooks, giving school superintendents the leeway to choose from a list of\napproved textbooks. The policy could accord more importance to local culture\nand history. But if alternative educational models are not in place, education\nmaterials cannot be purged of discriminatory content and erroneous historical\naccounts that make indigenous peoples invisible and misrepresent them.\n\nIn  all  these,  it  would  be  helpful  if  research  institutions  could  collect\ninformation on customary laws and practices\u2014whether in education, business,\ndispute  settlement,  land  utilization  and  environmental  protection,  or\nindigenous products and processes\u2014codify them, and make them available\nto legal practitioners and policy makers. That would pave the way for their\nadoption into the country\u2019s legal framework, and the fulfillment of a public\nadministration and management system that is sensitive to cultural variations.\n\nMainstreaming Diversity\n\nMainstreaming  diversity  means  mobilizing  policies,  provisions,  and\npractices in government departments and agencies to give ethnic minorities\naccess to public services in equal ways. This section examines whether the\norganizational  practices  of  critical  public  agencies  are  sensitized  to  service\ndelivery to indigenous peoples, if there have been attempts to assess the impact\nof policies and programs on ethnic groups, and what \u201cbest practices\u201d get results\nand set some institutions apart.\n\nIt is crucial first to define what mainstreaming is. Following Rovillos\nand Morales (2002), there are three points to consider. First, mainstreaming\nis not assimilation or integration. Rather, it should be based on respect for\ncultural diversity. Second, mainstreaming starts with the process of changing\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n284\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fManaging Diversity in the Philippines\n\n285\n\nthe mind set, or worldview, of government personnel with regard to indigenous\npeoples. They should steer clear of patronizing and stereotyped ideas about\nindigenous peoples. In their place, they should promote trust and acceptance\nof indigenous peoples as equal partners in the development process. Third,\nmainstreaming means integrating viable indigenous sociopolitical structures\ninto state structures and processes.\n\nSuch  changes  in  governance  and  public  administration,  if  adopted\nwidely in the bureaucracy, can theoretically lead, directly or indirectly, to\nimproving the status of indigenous peoples. Some emerging strategies, to\nborrow from the list prepared by the International Centre of Innovation\nand  Exchange  in  Public  Administration  (2003),  include,  for  example,\nparticipatory  assessments  of  conditions  of  indigenous  groups;  inclusive\n(multi-stakeholder,  multisectoral)  and  decentralized  policy  development,\nimplementation, and evaluation; targeted service delivery of social services;\nculture-sensitive budgeting and expenditure management; minority-involved\nevaluation of program outputs and impacts; and indigenous community-\nbased benchmarking.\n\nThe prevailing practice, however, is for national government units still\nto take it upon themselves to administer the affairs of indigenous communities.\nA specific indigenous affairs bureau is often mandated to that effect; local\nindigenous groups need to deal with this institution rather than with various\nunits of the national administrative system in general. Stavenhagen (2003)\ncalls attention to the situation where indigenous organizations may consider\nthis to be a form of discrimination, while government can argue that such\narrangements are designed for the protection of indigenous people themselves,\nin keeping with their best interests, but as defined by the state.\n\nThe National Commission on Indigenous Peoples\n\nIn  the  Philippines,  the  National  Commission  on  Indigenous  Peoples\n(NCIP) is the primary government agency responsible for promoting the rights\nand well-being of the indigenous cultural communities and indigenous peoples\nin the Philippines. The IPRA created the NCIP, which is directed\n\nto  formulate  and  implement  policies,  plans,  and  programs  for  the\ndevelopment of indigenous cultural communities and indigenous peoples\nand to review the applications for ancestral land titling, the issuance of\ncertificates of these titles, and the adjudication of disagreements regarding\nland ownership.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n285\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f286\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nNCIP\u2019s  governing  body  is  composed  of  seven  commissioners,  each  one  of\nwhom belongs to an indigenous cultural community chosen from the different\nethnographic areas in the Philippines where indigenous peoples reside.\n\nMore  specifically,  NCIP  does  the  following:  review  and  assess  the\nconditions of indigenous peoples, including existing laws and policies regarding\ntheir situation, and propose relevant laws and policies to address their role in\nnational development; issue certificates of ancestral land and ancestral domain\ntitle; enter into contracts, agreements, or arrangements with government or\nprivate agencies or entities; coordinate development programs and projects\nfor  the  advancement  of  the  indigenous  peoples  and  oversee  the  proper\nimplementation of these initiatives; and issue certification (as a precondition\nto the grant of a permit, lease, grant) for the disposition, use, management,\nand  appropriation  of  any  part  of  the  ancestral  domain,  provided  there  is\nconsensus approval of the indigenous peoples concerned (Bennagen 2000).\nTo ensure the delivery of basic services to indigenous peoples, NCIP is also\ntasked to coordinate closely with ongoing national initiatives on antipoverty\nreduction, such as KALAHI (Rovillos and Morales 2002).\n\nTo date, the institutional effectiveness of NCIP remains in doubt, as it\nhas  yet  to  consolidate  its  specific  role  and  leadership  in  the  promotion  of\nindigenous peoples\u2019 rights within the framework of IPRA. NCIP\u2019s weakness\nis illustrated by the slow pace of processing and approval of CADTs. There are\nalso  numerous  reports  that  several  CADT  applications  were  haphazardly\napproved, and did not go through the procedures mandated by the law. NCIP\u2019s\nAchilles\u2019 heel is its lack of clear leadership, according to assessment reports by\nindigenous groups themselves. NCIP officials are not equipped to meet its\ngoals, leading to flaws in its policy making, adjudication, and coordinated\ndelivery of basic services (Rovillos and Morales 2002).\n\nAccording to Rovillos and Morales, the challenge is to transform NCIP\ninto  a  model  of  good  governance.  Internally,  that  means  reenergizing  its\nbureaucracy, strengthening its leadership, equipping it with the right skills to\nmeet  its  duties,  and  changing  employees\u2019  mind  set  with  respect  to  their\nunderstanding of IPRA. Externally, it should help in building the capacities\nof  indigenous  organizations,  and  this  involves  strengthening  traditional\nstructures of leadership, governance, conflict resolution, and unity building,\nand setting up mechanisms for meaningful indigenous peoples\u2019 participation\nin government structures.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n286\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fManaging Diversity in the Philippines\n\n287\n\nEquality Institutions\n\nAside from a primary agency, other institutions to protect rights and\npromote equality must exist within the bureaucracy. Arguably, all public bodies,\ngovernment departments, and agencies must have a rights-based approach\nand  be  culturally  sensitive.  But  in  fact  only  a  few  public  agencies  exist  to\npromote  equality  and  combat  discrimination.  Aside  from  NCIP,  it  is  the\nCommission  on  Human  Rights  (CHR)  that  has  prospects  of  defending\nindigenous peoples\u2019 rights. But to do this, according to Stavenhagen (2003),\nit has to broaden its activities in the area of indigenous rights and incorporate\nand train an increasing number of indigenous legal defenders to be active in\ntaking up the human rights grievances of indigenous peoples. Stavenhagen\nindicates  that  CHR  could  organize  a  movement  to  create  a  broader  legal\nstructure  to  determine  and  certify  prior,  free,  and  informed  consent  by\nindigenous peoples.\n\nOn a broader front, NCIP and CHR can combine resources and jointly\nenforce equality proofing to improve service delivery in all government agencies.\nEquality proofing can be used to identify equality impacts and equality issues\nin the development of policy and in the provision of services, especially for\nindigenous groups. The aim is to remove the institutional processes and barriers\nthat prevent equality and the full and equal participation of minority ethnic\npeople. It can assist government agencies in checking that services meet the\nneeds  of  groups  that  experience  discrimination.  As  sketched  out  by  the\nEuropean Commission, equality proofing requires that equality objectives run\nthrough  all  aspects  of  the  policy  process\u2014planning,  implementation,\nmonitoring, and review. Agencies should assess at each step of their operation\nthe  impact  on  minority  groups.  For  this  purpose,  they  need  to  produce\ntemplates and guidelines that can help to address the specific experiences of\ninequality of indigenous peoples and ensure that equality is mainstreamed\ninto all agency activities (EC 2005).\n\nThe Civil Service\n\nThe challenge of diversity has wider implications for the Philippine civil\nservice, instead of just equality proofing. A really representative bureaucracy\nlends legitimacy to government by broadening its own base, and intensifying\nthe involvement of multiple stakeholders in delivering services that should\nreflect understanding of the cultures of the diverse communities served (UN\nSecretariat 2001).\n\nWhen minority groups are counted in, diversity promotes fairness and\njustice in the workplace, helps create economic opportunity, and reduces social\ninequality. A diverse workforce can improve organizational productivity and\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n287\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f288\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\ncreativity. Diversity gets the most out of the special abilities and insights that\nvarious groups bring to the job environment, in the process adding a greater\nvariety of viewpoints into policy making, broadening the range of possibilities\nfor consideration, and providing more realistic insights into complex, dynamic\nproblems. Increased representation thus ought to lead to a more responsive\nbureaucracy,  broad-based  consensus  around  the  decisions  reached,  and\nimproved grassroots support for programs and policies (Jemiai 2001). This\ntransforms the nature and demands of the tasks carried out in behalf of the\ncommunities served.\n\nThe civil service has to become more diverse to better accommodate the\nneeds of the heterogeneous communities it serves. It must recruit more from\nminority groups, in proportion to their numbers in the population. This assures\nfair treatment of groups, especially those that have been deprived in the past.\nThe Civil Service Commission (CSC) must meet the challenge of managing\nand motivating a workforce that includes individuals from indigenous groups.\nIt should start incorporating diversity goals and objectives into the agencies\u2019\nhuman resources management performance reviews. With CSC as the central\noversight body outlining the requirements of the plan, individual agencies\nand departments develop their own plans that are tailored to their specific\nneeds. When diversity efforts are decentralized, government agencies acquire\na sense of ownership and ensure that managing diversity has both top-level\nsupport and is a reality throughout the bureaucracy (Reichenberg 2001).\n\nIn order for underrepresented groups to gain their share of the benefits\nand power related to a civil service career, the CSC must spearhead policy\nmoves  to  encourage  diverse  recruitment.  It  can  work  with  colleges  and\nuniversities with significant minority students, and sourcing firms as well, to\nrecruit  diverse  talent.  The  hiring  strategies  include  outreach  through\nprofessional organizations, the posting of positions on the Internet, and the\nprovision of materials in minority languages.\n\nA more proactive stance would involve affirmative action\u2014a quota- and\ncompliance-driven approach that attempts to right past wrongs. It has statistical\ngoals for the recruitment, training, and promotion of specific underrepresented\ngroups (Bruce 2002). It would allocate jobs and promotions on the basis of\nmembership in a disadvantaged group. Affirmative action works when there\nis cultural exclusion. To depend only on general policies (say, growth with\nequity)  to  remove  group  inequalities  would,  according  to  UNDP  (2004),\ntake an unbearably long time, and create conditions for civil strife. Legislation,\nhowever, may be necessary to provide a legal basis for action and set standards.\nRequiring affirmative-action efforts through law compels agencies to establish\nserious goals and to make earnest efforts to meet those goals (Reichenberg\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n288\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fManaging Diversity in the Philippines\n\n289\n\n2001). It might be difficult, though, to achieve proportionality in the civil\nservice where the indigenous population is generally poor. In this case, securing\naccess to basic services like health care and education must precede any move\nto reduce underrepresentation.\n\nExtra care must be taken so that merit principles are not compromised\nwhen recruiting on the basis of ethnic quotas. Sometimes, marking out ethnic\norigin might have to the unintended result of highlighting differences between\nsocial  groups  in  the  workplace,  polarizing  them,  producing  conflict,  and\ngenerating a worse situation than the one it sets out to do away with (Jemiai\n2001). Affirmative-action programs may be contested as becoming a source\nof patronage\u2014but they can be managed better (UNDP 2004). They might\nlikewise  create  resistance  from  the  majority  group,  which  believes  that\n\u201cproportionality\u201d has unjustly deprived them of opportunities that, they think,\nmust  be  earned  through  individual  merit.  Note  that  disproportionate\nrepresentation  is  not  in  itself  objectionable;  what  is  disagreeable  is  when\nprocedures  and  practices  that  virtually  guarantee  disproportionate\nrepresentation to some while denying it to most are institutionalized (UN\nSecretariat 2001).\n\nIn  most  cases,  workforce  data  and  demographics  would  be  useful  to\neach  agency. That  would  make  it  easy  to  identify  underrepresentation  in\nplantilla positions and to establish goals to reduce it. Effective action plans\nalso link hiring to organizational performance, allowing the agency to map\ncareer paths for employees belonging to indigenous groups to see what critical\nskills are needed to advance. In a diverse workplace, agencies can determine,\nthrough  the  use  of  metrics,  surveys,  focus  groups,  customer  surveys,\nmanagement and employee evaluations, and training and education assessments\nhow  employees  deal  with  people  of  different  cultures  and  styles,  support\nworkplace diversity, include diverse people in work teams, and understand\nthe impact of diversity on the agency\u2019s goals. Affirmative action can succeed\nonly  if  agencies  utilize  more  measurable  criteria  to  rate  their  progress  in\nmanaging diversity (Reichenberg 2001).\n\nIndependent Arbitration\n\nAnother key building block of security for indigenous peoples can be\nthe presence of an independent third party to sift through local claims for\nvarious resources. For Ellsworth and White (2003), this can be a legal system\nof customary justice, independent courts, or an independent arbitrator.

Public-interest\nlawyers can use a variety of means to support community claims. They can\ntest cases in court, challenge previous court decisions, provide the legal expertise\nto write new laws, and fully use alternative dispute-resolution mechanisms.\nEllsworth and White note that in the whole sequence of events that led to the\npassage of IPRA\u2014from drafting and lobbying to advocacy and momentum\nbuilding  for  its  approval\u2014public  interest-lawyers  were  key  players  behind\nlegal actions. They likewise supplied key arguments in the Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision  to  uphold  the  law  after  mining  interests  challenged  the  act  as\nunconstitutional. One such group of public-interest lawyers is the Legal Rights\nand Resources Center (LRRC), which participated actively in the lobbying\nfor IPRA. LRRC helps litigate indigenous peoples\u2019 rights cases, and tries to\nchange the \u201crules of the game\u201d via policy advocacy. It also monitors changes\nin the \u201cpolicy climate\u201d to check whether it can favor minority groups (Leonen\n1998). These legal activists will have their hands full in future challenges to\nthe act, since the justices of the High Court themselves in separate opinions\nraised doubts on the all-encompassing nature of ancestral domain in light of\nthe existing Regalian doctrine (Rovillos and Morales 2002).\n\nIn developing countries like the Philippines, the infrastructure of public-\ninterest law is often frail, and activist lawyers willing to work with marginal\ncommunities are few. To build on this small beginning, it may be necessary to\nchampion  a  few  things,  like  seeking  donor  support  to  underwrite  legal\ncasework, supporting judicial reform and anticorruption measures, sponsoring\ntraining, and providing case mentorship for would-be public-interest lawyers\nand judges (Ellsworth and White 2003).\n\nDecentralizing Diversity Management\n\nIt will prove very difficult to introduce structural changes in diversity\nmanagement with a long-term impact if they do not extend to the local level.\nMost policies, special measures, and services that positively affect the daily\nlives of indigenous peoples are truly effective only if conceived and carried out\nat a level closest to those affected. In the Philippines, a bright prospect that\ncould come from the passage of the Local Government Code (LGC) in 1991\nwould be local authorities gaining competencies to design and implement\npolicies responsive to ethnic diversity.\n\nLocal-level initiatives\u2014or \u201cbottom up\u201d processes with the representation\nor  direct  involvement  of  indigenous  minorities\u2014are  crucial  in  resolving\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n290\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fManaging Diversity in the Philippines\n\n291\n\nequality issues. They are often better than centrally directed schemes to manage\nethnic disputes at the local level. It is the development of inclusive local systems\nof governance that are quick to respond to the special needs of diverse minorities\nthat  is  crucial  to  the  preservation  of  multiethnic  communities  and  the\nprevention of conflict (B\u00edr\u00f3 and Kov\u00e1cs 2001).\n\nDecentralization  is  not,  of  course,  a  cure-all  for  the  woes  of  ethnic\nminorities. At the same time, it is clear that an exclusive national approach,\neven if based on international standards, does not necessarily secure a superior\nmethod of dealing with the exclusion of minorities in decision making. What\nis needed, according to Gyurova (2001), is a realistic balance between the\nauthorities  of  the  central  government  and  the  local  government  in\nimplementing effective diversity management in a multiethnic setting. What\nis wrong is when central government control gets in harm\u2019s way and becomes\na barrier\u2014along with skewed enforcement of law, poor technical know-how,\nand too little resources\u2014to boosting local government capacity to manage\nthe needs of diverse communities (B\u00edr\u00f3 and Kov\u00e1cs 2001).\n\nAs an ethnically diverse country, the Philippines has taken steps to grant\ndecentralized powers to territorially concentrated ethnic groups, to respond\nmore flexibly to their needs. It is an asymmetrical arrangement in which two\nsubnational units have special status. The Autonomous Region of Muslim\nMindanao (ARMM), covering five Muslim-dominated provinces, the outcome\nof  arduous  negotiations  between  the  central  Government  and  the  Moro\nNational  Liberation  Front,  has  substantial  autonomy  in  key  areas  such  as\neducation, agriculture, social development, health, and industry. It has been\ngranted  explicit  tax  and  expenditure  powers  beyond  those  of  other  local\ngovernment units. This power-sharing arrangement has proven to be somewhat\ncrucial in resolving tensions in Southern Philippines, which is still faced with\nMuslim  secessionist  movements.  The  drawback  of  negotiated  political\nsettlements (like ARMM), however (as UNDP 2004 contends), is that they\nshould  have  been  introduced  early  enough  (when  tensions  were  still\nmanageable) to preclude violence and civil strife. The Cordillera Region in\nNorthern Luzon, another territorially compact grouping, also negotiated for\nself-government but had to settle for less than that as a result of two failed\nplebiscites. Indigenous groups in the Cordillera have a long tradition of self-\ngovernment that they are unwilling to compromise.\n\nThese out-of-the-ordinary measures allow political cohabitation between\ngroups that are territorially packed together and the central authority. Such\nhands-on interventions have helped accommodate important differences, yet\ndo not compromise allegiance to the state. They are often worth much more\nthan the organizational costs that such arrangements bring upon themselves\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n291\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f292\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\n(UNDP  2004).  In  a  few  cases,  even  if  the  center  is  acquiescent  on  ethnic\nissues, separatists may block the implementation of decentralized minority\npolicies.  Even  if  the  principle  of  subsidiarity  has  proven  its  value,  existing\npublic  management  arrangements  are  still  very  much  works-in-progress,\nrequiring  vigorous  domestic  supervision  and  international  monitoring  to\nimprove minority protection in the affected regions (B\u00edr\u00f3 and Kov\u00e1cs 2001).\nFor the rest of the ethnic groups that are territorially dispersed, their\npolitical  participation  at  different  levels  is  much  more  circumscribed. The\nethnic patchwork across the country means significantly lower multiethnic\nrepresentation  in  municipal  and  provincial  councils.  Virtually  no  equal\nopportunity policies exist at the local level. The LGC is quiet on local diversity\nmanagement. Antidiscrimination measures are initiated by local authorities\nmore to prevent violence against ethnic minorities. Institutional bias takes\nplace but is largely ignored. Other negative factors that hold back diversity\ninclude the political exploitation of ethnic problems (mainly by local-level\nand district-level politicians), low levels of professionalism and competence\namong local public administration officials, the lack of culture-sensitive training\nfor administrative staff at all levels, and poor interaction between municipalities\nand ethnic minority representatives. There are no public management initiatives\nthat can have room for proportional ethnic representation in local councils.\nIronically, it takes a major conflict, such as the civil strife in Southern\nPhilippines, to dissect the ramifications of ethnic discrimination and highlight\na post-conflict need for diversity management.\n\nA  postwar  context,  as  Dimitrijevi\u00e7  and  Kovacs  (2004)  suggest,  often\ngives rise to governance practices (management of everyday life issues, as well\nas of specific post-violence issues) that may further deepen intergroup distrust\nand exclusion, especially if there are \u201cmajoritarian domination patterns\u201d\u2014\ncases where victorious groups form political cocoons, taking power by virtue\nof their numbers. Post-conflict public management is more effective if it focuses\non crosscutting issues not directly linked to the conflicting positions of the\nrecent  past  but  equally  imperative  to  all  groups  in  local  settings.  Daily,\nnoncontroversial \u201creal life\u201d issues include housing, schooling, health care, local\ninfrastructure, and jobs. The overriding intent, according to Dimitrijevi\u00e7 and\nKovacs (2004), is to narrow the gap between conflict-burdened groups by\nrestoring their interaction on questions that are jointly observable as being in\nthe common interest. Once confidence is reestablished, the hard issues of the\nlegacy of violent conflict can be approached in sober, non-functionalist terms.\nIt can be argued that the current situation in Mindanao requires a more\ncomplex and comprehensive approach, which must go beyond existing ad\nhoc mechanisms for managing multiethnic concerns. Right now, there are\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n292\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fManaging Diversity in the Philippines\n\n293\n\ntwo  conflict  management  patterns  that  may  help  alleviate  the  burden  of\nintolerance that still characterizes much of the Mindanao reality. Top-down\napproaches initiated by the central Government\u2014for example, the current\nnegotiations on ancestral domain between the Moro Islamic Liberation Front\nand the national authorities\u2014have their usefulness in mediating minimum\nconditions for peace and security. Bottom-up conflict-resolution efforts zero\nin on locally supported processes of reconciliation and sustainable coexistence.\nNGOs and people\u2019s organizations are the major players in these rehabilitation\nand reintegration schemes.\n\nIt  is  helpful  to  check  whether  such  synergies  are  present  in  many\ncommunities in the area. Datu Paglas, located in Maguindanao, has gone\nfrom being the scene of intense conflict to being a model for municipalities\nthat are attempting to encourage postwar reconciliation through responsive\ngovernance.  Its  constituency  of  Muslims,  Christians,  and  Lumads  have\nbanded  together  to  help  the  local  government  unit  identify,  plan,  and\nimplement  program  measures  that  range  from  shelter,  child  care,  and\nnutrition to livelihood. NGOs, people\u2019s organizations, and local councils\nget together to understand their own constraints, analyze their problems\nand opportunities, and implement self-help projects (LGSP 2004). A more\nadvanced \u201cenabling\u201d case was the effort of people\u2019s organizations to pick up\nthe  pieces  in  post-conflict  settings  in  several  sites  across  Mindanao. The\ngroups that \u201cowned the conflict,\u201d that is, those who sustained the conflict\nthrough their attitudes and actions, had to yield to entities who wished to\n\u201cown the peace\u201d through the construction of structures of peace and the\ndeconstruction of the structures of violence (and the power and authority\nthat goes with it). In Sultan sa Barongis, Ipil, Busbus, Siocon, Malita, and\nLake Sebu\u2014all multiethnic and multireligious areas\u2014people\u2019s organizations\nemerged to get together and initiate projects such as peace education and\nthe  installation  of  a  community  radio  that  aired  peace  promotion  and\ninformation. The local government units supported the project and allocated\nthe budget needed to take it off the ground (Bush 2004).\n\nKrylova-Mueller (2004) makes a case for the need for good governance\nof ethnic minorities in post-conflict situations. Central to local governance is\nthe introduction of nondiscriminatory public services and budgeting, inter-\nmunicipal planning of infrastructure and economic rehabilitation, increased\nmechanisms for power sharing and civic participation, and, more importantly,\nthe  revision  of  local  policies  and  approaches,  including  those  aimed  at\nminorities. A nondiscriminatory approach to resource distribution, Krylova-\nMueller suggests, helps create a government that can guarantee local human\nsecurity and ensure multiethnic confidence.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n293\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f294\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nNon-conflict local jurisdictions with indigenous peoples, on the other\nhand, can promote culturally sensitive public management in a number of\nways.  They  can  begin  drafting  plans  of  action  for  minorities  with\nrepresentatives  of  these  groups;  examine  whether  there  is  low  uptake  of\nservices and culturally inappropriate services and improve equality-focused\nentitlements;  raise  awareness  among  local  civil  servants  of  culturally\nappropriate and responsive ways to organize services; develop a culturally\ncompetent workforce; and develop support networks in local communities\n(EC  2005).  They  can  adjust  the  ethnic  composition  of  social  services,\nemployment, and social activities to the ethnic structure of the population\n(Janji\u00e7 2004).\n\nSince  there  are  no  \u201cofficial\u201d  institutional  mechanisms  for  managing\ndiversity at the local level, local government units with considerable indigenous\npopulations  can  choose  to  implement  varying  types  of  power-sharing\narrangements with indigenous groups. They can, following Bieber (2004),\nguarantee minority representation in local bodies and enable minorities to\nexert some kind of a veto at appropriate levels of decision making. Control\nover decisions about who has access to services will, of course, create changes\nin  the  political  landscape,  which  local  authorities  should  be  prepared  to\nconcede. Compromise is in the nature of rights acquired through political\nbattles (Ellsworth and White 2003).\n\nPromoting Voice and Participation\n\nA closely linked enfranchising element is participation and involvement\nof indigenous groups as service users and of the organizations representing\nthem. Diversity management is more likely to yield a positive outcome if all\ncitizens and all ethnic groups living in local communities realize that the stakes\nof good governance are their own stakes, and, therefore, can be sustained only\nif they chip in their voice and participation. The question is, can government\nhelp put in place the building blocks of participation to advance the cause of\nindigenous  groups?  What  forms  of  interaction  can  be  developed  between\ngovernment agencies and indigenous communities?\n\nIndigenous groups develop their own internal institutions. They monitor\nand sanction compliance with those rules. These are often consensus-based\nand guided by assemblies that represent households; elders often preside at\nthese assemblies. Historically, this tradition came before the rise of nation-\nstates  and  formal  governance  systems  and  continues  to  function  wherever\ncommunities retain collective rights over resources (Ellsworth and White 2003).\nEthnic minorities have common grounds with majority groups, which generally\nrely on community and self-help initiatives. In the Philippines, this is due in\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n294\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fManaging Diversity in the Philippines\n\n295\n\npart to the limitations on the government\u2019s ability to respond to community\nneeds (Siddique 2001).\n\nIt is inevitable that these customary systems have to interrelate with formal\nstate systems. To a large extent, according to Ellsworth and White (2003), the\npower of local institutions can be measured by their effectiveness in handling\ninteraction with the government. Success\u2014when customary rules are effectively\nenforced\u2014is affected by the degree to which a community acts in a coherent\nand organized manner and by the degree to which the state recognizes the\nlegitimacy of local rules and enforcement. The community must be organized\nto  face  the  government;  in  turn,  the  government  must  be  willing  to\nacknowledge community-drawn policies.\n\nThese days, there are many ways in which an organized group and a\nresponsive government can act together. Even if legal recognition has been\nsecured by indigenous groups (as in the case of the IPRA), legal, policy, and\nadministrative assistance is a helpful companion (given in part by NCIP). A\npolitical constituency for indigenous rights can profit from the advice and\ntechnical assistance of interested individuals who cannot be an active part of a\ncoalition, such as people who work within the government bureaucracy. For\nexample, indigenous peoples can be given technical advice on how to recognize\nrights and assess risks (particularly rights at risk) in the planning and project\ncycles associated with development projects and programs\u2014particularly large-\nscale interventions such as mining and dams.4\n\nIn the Philippines, government social services work to rebuild broken\nrelationships in communities divided by conflict. Through dozens of focus\ngroup discussions conducted with indigenous peoples, Muslims, and Christians\ndisplaced  by  violence,  teams  from  the  Department  of  Social  Work  and\nDevelopment bring people together across lines of religion and conflict to\nfind peaceful solutions to common problems. In some cases, these sessions\nlead  to  community-level  conflict  mediation,  and  in  others  they  produce  a\ncommitment  to  establish  \u201czones  of  peace\u201d\u2014conflict-free  areas  where\ncommunity members work with local authorities to pursue local development\npeacefully.  A  more  passive  interaction  can  take  place  when  government\nrecognizes a local organization as the legal representative of an indigenous\ngroup.  For  instance,  the  community-based  Bakun  Indigenous  Tribes\nOrganization (BITO) in Benguet, was officially accredited to lead in managing\n\n4 Clarifying the rights context for a proposed project is a necessary phase in identifying those legitimate\nclaims and entitlements that may be affected by the project. The assessment of risk adds an important\naspect to understanding how, and to what extent, a project may affect people\u2019s rights. The group\u2019s\nstake in the project must be equal to their exposure to the risk (WCD 2000).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n295\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f296\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nthe ancestral domain of the Kankanaey and Bago peoples in Bakun, who were\nawarded a CADC in 1998 (Rovillos and Morales 2002).\n\nDuring the post-martial law period, the state encouraged the formation\nand growth of civil society. The Philippines is the only Southeast Asian country\nthat  has  a  strong  civil  society.  In  most  central  concerns  of  governance,\ninstitutions  of  civil  society  are  taking  part  (Siddique  2001)  and  have  a\nsophisticated understanding of the political and social landscape. In the national\nplanning  process,  they  are  now  recognized  as  legitimate  partners  and\ninterlocutors of government (Stavenhagen 2005). Civil society groups have\nthe ability to lobby, as well as to assist Congress in legislation. The IPRA is a\ncase in point. The indigenous peoples and the groups working for their rights\ncontributed substantially to the provisions of the law. They were also able to\nsee the law through to its enactment (Bennagen 2000). The victory of this\ncivil society coalition owed much to the quality of their legal and lobbying\nwork (Perrot-Ma\u00eetre and Ellsworth 2003). The civil society\u2013Congress interface\nwas brought about in part by the appointment of sectoral representatives for\nindigenous peoples in the House of Representatives. The sectoral representatives\ncould touch base with their constituencies and solicit their inputs and at the\nsame time be an organic part of the legislative process itself, aided considerably\nby  sympathetic  elected  legislators.  An  important  outcome  of  civil  society\nparticipation in the making of the law is the increasing recognition within\nCongress, or at least in the Senate, of the value of a participatory legislative\nprocess (Bennagen 2000). Civil society, in short, can build grassroots consensus\nand bring legitimacy to it at a critical political moment.\n\nAn important role the government can play is to link indigenous groups\nand their organizations to international donors. Donors played an important\nrole in the great effort to obtain the passage of the IPRA. Over many years,\nthey financed and gave technical support to many of the public-interest law\nfirms,  NGOs,  and  indigenous  rights  organizations  that  were  at  its  center.\nThey funded field trials for and training on ancestral domain mapping and\nconcession management. They also paid for influential research, evaluations,\nand  consultancies  that  intimated  to  government  the  consequences  of\ndiscriminating against indigenous communities (Perrot-Ma\u00eetre and Ellsworth\n2003).\n\nGiving  power  to  local  political  constituencies  and  accepting  civic\nmobilization as a tool to achieve reforms are but two of the important ways in\nwhich government can help the cause of minorities. As the IPRA case illustrates,\ncivic activity can be activated to lobby Congress, hold consultations, and even\nstage  peaceful  protests.  Indigenous  peoples  must  be  allowed  to  participate\nfully in national and international gatherings where issues directly affecting\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n296\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fManaging Diversity in the Philippines\n\n297\n\nthem  are  being  discussed\u2014including  environmental  agreements,  and\nnegotiations around global, regional, and bilateral trade agreements and debt\n(UN ESC 2005). The least government can do is uphold these rights and\nincrease the capacity of indigenous peoples to negotiate with others on their\nown behalf.\n\nJumpstarting Monitoring and Evaluation\n\nThis section deals with monitoring and evaluation aspects by checking\nwhether government collects information that properly reflects the experiences\nof the ethnic groups that suffer inequality.\n\nKeeping  an  eye  on  the  progress  of  diversity  management  is  essential.\nSince managing diverse groups is a complicated process, it makes technical\nsense  to  track  its  growth  and  advancement.  Here,  there  are  several  ways\ngovernment  can  help.  Government  research  institutions  like  the  National\nStatistics Office can provide data\u2014demographics, among others\u2014necessary\nfor analyses. Government think tanks like the Philippine Institute for Policy\nStudies, the Development Academy of the Philippines, and the University of\nthe Philippines can produce policy research outputs, as an aid to policy making\nby NCIP. DENR can assist indigenous communities in mapping and creating\nland use plans, making use, say, of geographic information systems (GIS).\nDSWD can undertake participatory appraisal at the community level.\n\nThe lack of government capacity and resources, however, has left the\nresponsibility to the communities and support groups and their donor partners.\nFor example, mapping the ancestral domains in Mindanao is being facilitated\nby the Philippine Association for Intercultural Development (PAFID), with\nfinancial  and  technical  support  from  the  Rome-based  International  Land\nCoalition. Interestingly, the participatory mapping process follows the principle\nof \u201cself-delineation,\u201d as required by the IPRA in its guidelines for plotting\nancestral  domains.  To  facilitate  this  critical  activity,  PAFID  provides\nprofessional know-how on both traditional and state-of-the-art technology,\nincluding the Global Positioning System (GPS), to ensure data accuracy and\ncost minimization. The Ancestral Domain Sustainable Protection Plans, based\non the map and developed by the indigenous groups, serve as the community\u2019s\nguide in managing its resources. The only government role here is to receive,\nthrough the NCIP, formal claims for CADTs accomplished and filed by the\npartner  communities  (ILC  2003).  Sadly,  most  ancestral  domains  with\ncompleted CADCs have not undergone on-ground survey and delineation,\nand therefore remain vulnerable to various competing claims. Cultural mapping\nis a prerequisite to any government activity that seeks to direct services to the\nreally deserving communities. As an initial step, Rovillos and Morales (2002)\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n297\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f298\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nsuggest an inventory of baseline data on indigenous peoples from government\nagencies and NGOs; NCIP should provide a specific format for data gathering\nand should consolidate all collected information. The lack of basic information\nalso translates into lack of indicators to chart the well-being of indigenous\npeoples.\n\nWithin  government,  \u201cequality  monitoring\u201d  can  help  jump-start  the\nprocess.  National  agencies  and  local  government  units  can  start  with  the\ncollection and analysis of basic data specific to their mandates to serve ethnic\nminorities. But beyond that, they can assess the effectiveness of their policies,\nprocesses, and practices in ending inequalities among indigenous groups. The\nfirst can help to give a picture of the composition of ethnic minorities and\nidentify where particular groups are underserved and underrepresented. The\nsecond is a proactive way to assess the impact of policies on claims, entitlements,\nand resource allocation. The equality review should end with an action plan\nhighlighting areas for policy and organizational changes.\n\nThe Way Forward\n\nThe lack of effective diversity management is one of the most urgent\nissues  affecting  stability  and  human  development  in  the  Philippines. The\nchallenge of building a pluralist, multiethnic, and multicultural governance\nstructure and directing the richness of the country\u2019s diversity toward positive\nchange remains. The cost of ignoring diversity will be far greater than the\ncosts  of  accepting  and  managing  it.  Hence,  public  administration  in  the\nPhilippines ought to be transformed into a responsive instrument to meet the\nneeds of all citizens, including ethnic groups, to be accountable to the most\nvulnerable  populations,  and  to  understand  differences  and  prevent  social\nexclusion.\n\nPublic  administration  cannot  remain  its  old  self.  To  begin  with,\ngovernment needs to be revitalized, to become more proactive, more efficient,\nmore accountable, and especially more service-oriented. To accomplish this\ntransformation,  government  agencies  need  to  make  innovations  in  their\norganizational structure, practices, capacities, and how they mobilize, deploy,\nand  utilize  the  human,  material,  information,  technological,  and  financial\nresources for service delivery to remote, disadvantaged, and challenged people\n(UNPAN 2003). Cultural differences must be considered in the design of\nlaws on public administration (Laya 2001).\n\nThere are a few things to consider when developing diversity management\n\nstrategies.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n298\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fManaging Diversity in the Philippines\n\n299\n\nSustaining the Legal Framework\n\nThe government should develop and act with indigenous communities\non a new agenda. This agenda could, following Ellsworth and White (2003),\nbe used to: (i) accelerate the transition from access to ancestral domain to\ncommunity  ownership,  as  required  by  IPRA;  (ii)  aggressively  explore  and\ndevelop mechanisms to ensure the protection of community rights in markets\nfor environmental services and genetic materials; and (iii) develop and support\neffective  enforcement  mechanisms  for  protecting  community  resources.\nGovernment must hasten the legal process of claim making through various\nbureaucratic reform actions. (The government\u2019s current rationalization program\nshould cover NCIP, so that it can be professionally prepared to jump into\naction.  Corollary  measures  include  supporting  anticorruption  and  justice\nreform activities at the national level.)\n\nThe proposal of the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights, that the\nPhilippine judiciary fully respect the legislative intent and spirit of IPRA and\nensure  that  utmost  favor  be  accorded  to  indigenous  peoples  in  resolving\nconflicts of law between IPRA and other national legislation such as the 1995\nMining Act, should be adopted. Moreover, special training programs should\nbe designed for judges, prosecutors, and legal defenders regarding indigenous\npeoples\u2019 rights and cultures (Stavenhagen 2003).\n\nThe IPRA provisions on free prior and informed consent in securing\nclearance for projects in indigenous peoples\u2019 areas should be fully implemented.\nA citizen\u2019s charter on free, prior, and informed consent must be formulated\nand distributed to organizations of indigenous peoples. To the extent possible,\nland rights should take priority over commercial development, but in cases of\ntrade-offs, reconciling claims and entitlements must be founded on upholding\nsocial justice for indigenous communities.\n\nThe Special Rapporteur\u2019s suggestions with respect to strengthening NCIP\nmust also be followed: that the NCIP be firmly established as the lead agency\nin protecting and promoting indigenous rights, as well as in implementing\ngovernment policy with regard to the indigenous communities; that adequate\ninstitutional,  human,  and  financial  resources  be  allocated  to  NCIP;  that\ncompetent NCIP offices be set up in every indigenous area; that NCIP further\nimprove its coordination with other government agencies, particularly with\nDENR, for the effective implementation of IPRA, especially as regards the\nquestion of ancestral domain claims and titles (Stavenhagen 2003).\n\nNCIP  should  help  in  the  capability  building  of  indigenous  peoples\u2019\norganizations at the local, regional, and national levels.

With the assistance of the CSC, NCIP should\nmainstream  indigenous  peoples\u2019  rights  and  development  concepts  in  all\ngovernment line agencies and local government units.\n\nMaking the Civil Service IP-Friendly\n\nEmploying  persons  with  indigenous  background  in  visible  public\npositions (in central and local public administrative positions, for example)\nwould  represent  an  important  initial  step  in  offsetting  their  striking\nunderrepresentation in the public sector. Intensive training to increase the job\nqualifications of minorities can remove discrimination in the bureaucracy.\n\nEducating government officials on the issues of community rights and\nwell-being can make a difference in the way these officials behave vis-\u00e0-vis\nindigenous peoples. The reorientation, according to Laya (2001), should cover\nthe history, culture, and struggle of cultural communities; for Staich (2000),\nit should discard stereotypes and stay away from generalizations.\n\nThe CSC must create a blueprint for action, especially with respect to\nrecruitment and training issues. A diversity steering committee might help.\nFor this purpose, the CSC should produce materials that are culturally correct\nand are translated appropriately into minority languages, with messages that\nare culturally relevant and that resonate with target audiences.\n\nReinventing Culture-Insensitive LGUs\n\nLocal government units, especially those with ethnic minorities, should\nmake their policies more inclusive and culture-sensitive. They should launch\ncampaigns against the assimilationist attitudes of local majority communities.\nTo  trigger  these  changes,  amending  the  LGC  may  be  necessary.  Likewise,\nfurther  decentralization  initiatives  must  consider  putting  in  place  culture-\nfriendly program mechanisms at the local level.\n\nLocal government units are in the best position to monitor commercial\ninterests so that they do not needlessly appropriate the ancestral domain of\nindigenous residents. Likewise, it is local authorities who can design, with\nrepresentatives from the indigenous communities, locality-specific plans that\nhave heightened sensitivity to cultural nuances and are fine-tuned to local\ntenurial systems.\n\nEmpowering Communities and NGOs\n\nGovernment agencies like NCIP and CHR can assist in educating and\ninforming communities of their rights, and in developing legal property rights\nmodels  involving  ancestral  domain  that  can  withstand  the  scrutiny  of  the\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n300\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fManaging Diversity in the Philippines\n\n301\n\njudiciary. They can develop the capacity of indigenous peoples\u2019 organizations\nat the community level to implement projects that safeguard their rights, with\nappropriate intervention from local government units. They can build and\nfield-test models related to such projects and scale these up if successful. Central\nauthorities can help create a learning network that includes cross-site visits\nand apprenticeships nationally.\n\nGovernment  can  provide  scholarships  and  training  opportunities  to\nindigenous  groups,  complemented  with  opportunities  for  their  leaders  to\ninteract with political leaders and government officials. It can improve the\ntechnical capacity and skills of civil society groups so that they can be better\nequipped to participate in the legislative process. It should sponsor in-depth\ndiscussions and dialogues among indigenous peoples and between them and\ngovernment,  to  develop  further  perspectives  and  recommendations  on\nindigenous development.\n\nLinking with International Donors\n\nIt will be necessary, according to Ellsworth and White (2003), to link the\ndiverse networks of indigenous groups, their advocates, and international partners\nto build a concerted global political constituency able to leverage new funds,\nnew technology, and new political openness to expand community rights.\n\nMonitoring and Sustainability Concerns\n\nA necessary first step is to know the \u201cnumbers\u201d (e.g., ethnic composition,\ngeographic concentration). Disaggregated data on indigenous peoples should\nbe collected in all areas where they are found. Government should also collect\ndata on property claims and ownership at local and subnational levels. These\ndata are useful in marshaling arguments for advancing community claims.\nThe mapping and delineation of ancestral domain boundaries can be supported\nby providing a sound policy environment to those who undertake it in support\nof ancestral tenure (Ellsworth and White 2003).\n\nPrograms and projects on the extent and availability of (and access to)\ngovernment services must be checked regularly, to determine if there is greater\nfocus and better targeting of basic services in priority indigenous peoples\u2019 areas.\nAll  things  considered,  it  should  be  remembered  that  there  are  no\npermanent solutions to key issues of diversity management, only more or less\nacceptable ones. Following Sch\u00f6pflin (2001), what is important is to provide\nspace for clarifications and remedial action, which in turn requires that those\nexercising power (central and local authorities) have the nuanced awareness\nand flexibility to reconcile competing claims and interests sensibly and in a\nnondiscriminatory way.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n301\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f302\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nReferrences\n\nAnyaoku, Emeka. n.d.

Yunusov1\n\nShamshod A. Yunusov2\n\nAdministrative Reform in Uzbekistan\n\nThe Republic of Uzbekistan has been a sovereign state since September\n1991. It is in the middle of Central Asia and occupies most of the area between\nthe Amu-Darya and Syr-Darya rivers, a total of 448,900 square kilometers.\nThe population of Uzbekistan, estimated at 26,410,416 in 2004, is the\nlargest in the Central Asian republics, composing more than 40% of their\ntotal population.\n\nThe ethnic composition of Uzbekistan consists of Uzbeks (77%) and\nseveral minorities: Russians (6%), Tajiks (5.1%), Kazakhs (4.2%), Crimea\nTartars (2%), Karakalpaks (2%), Koreans (1%), Kyrgyzs (1%), and others\n(1.7%).\n\nMore than 60% of the population of Uzbekistan is rural. During the\nSoviet era (1924\u20131991), the production of cotton and grain led to overuse of\n\n1\n\n2\n\nProfessor, Economics Theory Department, Ferghana State University, Uzbekistan.\n\nStudent, Faculty of Economics, Ferghana State University, Uzbekistan.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n307\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f308\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nagrochemicals and the depletion of water supplies, which left the land polluted\nand  the  Aral  Sea  and  certain  rivers  half  dry.  Independent  since  1991,  the\ncountry  is  seeking  to  gradually  lessen  its  dependence  on  agriculture  while\ndeveloping its mineral and petroleum reserves. Uzbekistan is now the world\u2019s\nsecond-largest cotton exporter to Russia, People\u2019s Republic of China, Iran,\nBangladesh, Republic of Korea, and Viet Nam; a large producer of gold and\noil; and a regionally significant producer of chemicals and machinery. After\nindependence  in  December  1991,  the  Government  sought  to  prop  up  its\nSoviet-style  command  economy  with  subsidies  and  strict  controls  on\nproduction and prices. Uzbekistan chose to emphasize import-substituting\nindustrialization (the country milled 3% of its cotton harvest in 1990 and\n28% in 2004, and is expected to mill up to 51% of the harvest by 2008) and\nhas tightened export and currency controls within its already largely closed\neconomy, following the Asian financial crisis.\n\nIn the Republic of Uzbekistan regional policy deals with the Republic of\nKarakalpakstan, 12 oblasts3 or regions, and the capital city of Tashkent, with\ntheir 120 cities, 113 towns, 159 rural administrative districts, 11,844 rural\nsettlements, and 7,501 local self-governing bodies (makhallya).\n\nPresent-day  governance  of  the  regions  does  not  fully  meet  the\ndevelopment needs of the country. Traditional methods of governance are still\nin use. The established structure, functions, and practice of regional government\nface increasing challenge as administrative reform proceeds and the economy\nis further liberalized.\n\nAs foreign and Uzbek experts have pointed out, one way to improve\ngovernance is through decentralization, which transfers responsibility from\nthe center to local self-governing bodies, and at the same time builds up civil\nsociety  organizations  (Economic  Review  2005,  page  3;  Pugach  2005,  pages\n21\u201325). The experience worldwide shows that decentralization that does not\ntake into account the specific conditions of the country can have the most\ndisastrous  consequences:  a  weakened  economy,  unequal  access  to  services,\nand greater poverty. Economic and social development differences between\nregions  can  be  evened  out  only  through  efficient  use  of  geography  and\ncompetitive advantage.\n\n3 The  12  regions  are:  Andijan,  Bukhara,  Jizzakh,  Kashkadarya,  Navoi,  Namangan,  Samarkand,\nSurkhandarya, Sirdarya, Tashkent, Ferghana, and Khorezm. Other researchers (Madirimov 2005,\npage 29) divide the regions into six territories: Ferghana (Andijan, Ferghana, and Namangan), Tashkent\n(Tashkent city and Tashkent region), Mirzachul (Jizzakh and Sirdarya), Central (Samarkand, Navoi,\nand Bukhara), Southern (Kashkadarya and Sukrhandarya), and Amudarya (Khorezm and Karakalpak\nRepublic) (Madirimov 2005, page 29).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n308\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fReducing Socioeconomic Inequality in Uzbekistan\n\n309\n\nDecentralization  is  one  of  the  directions  of  administrative  reform  in\nUzbekistan. It is the framework within which the functions of state governing\nbodies are being revised and reduced, and the authority of regional and local\ngoverning bodies is being strengthened. Abaturov (2005, page 15) affirms the\nsignificance of the current situation in the regions of Uzbekistan, given the\nneed for social harmony:\n\nEstablished structure, functions and practice of regional government bodies\ncome to contradiction with process of decentralization of state government,\ndeepening  of  the  administrative  reforms  and  further  liberalization  of\neconomics.\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\nSince 2003, Uzbekistan has carried out a series of administrative reforms\n\naimed at:\n\nFurther reducing state influence on the economy, doing away with\nelements  of  the  command  administrative  system,  and  radically\nchanging the structure and system of government;\n\n(cid:127) Abolishing the centralized system of distribution and changing over\n\nto market-driven methods of production; and\nSetting up new modes of interaction between the state and the society,\nwith provisions for greater transparency in state government activity.\n\nThe primary tasks of state government reform in the regions within the\n\nframework of the public administrative reforms are as follows:\n\nImprove the standard of living;\n\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127) Ensure the efficient functioning and economic development of the\n\nregions;\nSet  the  conditions  and  the  foundation  for  sustainable  regional\ndevelopment; and\nImplement institutional, investment, and technical policies.\n\nRegional government reforms are based on several assumptions. First,\nthe regional government bodies carry out economic policies developed by the\ncentral  Government.  Second,  the  regional  government  bodies  plan  and\nimplement regional policies to improve the standard of living in the regions\nand to ensure sustainable regional development in social, economic, political,\nand  ecological  terms.  Third,  the  regional  government  bodies  act  as\nintermediaries between government, enterprise, and civil society.

Pugach (2005, page 22) believes that greater economic balance\nbetween the regions can be achieved if government were to create the conditions\nfor the development of entrepreneurship.\n\nRegional Economic Development in Uzbekistan\n\nUzbekistan is a collection of regions that differ from one another in the\nlevel of economic development, specialization, and natural-climatic conditions,\nbut are closely bound together as well by trade and by modern-day specialized\nproduction. Each one produces largely for other regions and also receives a\nmajor part of the production of other regions. The economy of the country\noften depends on the trade turnover of only one region.\n\nThe  regional  aspects  of  economic  development  have  significance  for\nUzbekistan  because  of  the  climatic,  geographic,  and  economic  differences\nbetween  regions.  Regional  factors  may  greatly  affect  the  nature  and\nconsequences of the socioeconomic changes in the country.\n\nIn  recent  years  some  positive  results  have  been  achieved  in  regional\ndevelopment by expanding the authority of local government, strengthening\nthe  local  economies,  and  setting  up  and  modernizing  facilities  for  the\nexploitation of their mineral and raw material resources, as well as their natural\nand economic potential.\n\nThe  socioeconomic  disparities  have  objective  causes  (differences  in\ngeography and economic potential). All the same, the present situation and\nthe dynamics of the interregional differentiation need to be improved.\n\nThe  main  reasons  for  the  differences  in  socioeconomic  development\n\nbetween regions are:\n\n(cid:127) The  high  concentration  of  industrial  production  and  production\n\ninfrastructure in the Tashkent and Ferghana regions;\n\n(cid:127) The insufficient adaptation of the mostly agrarian regions (particularly\nthe  Republic  of  Karakalpakstan,  and  the  Khoresm,  Surkhandarya,\nSyrdarya, and Jizzakh regions) to the market environment;\n\n(cid:127) Uneven distribution of local and foreign investment;\n(cid:127) Unsound use of the natural and economic potential of the regions;\n(cid:127) Unequal budget allocation; and\n(cid:127)\n\nInadequate economic regulation of the regions taking their unique\nfeatures into account.\n\nAdjusting  the  level  of  socioeconomic  development  of  the  regions  by\nremoving  or  at  least  minimizing  the  current  obstacles  and  inequalities  is\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n310\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fReducing Socioeconomic Inequality in Uzbekistan\n\n311\n\nimportant  for  the  sustainable  and  balanced  economic  development  of  the\ncountry. It requires defining development trends in the regions and analyzing\ntheir economy in some depth.

At the regional\nlevel, the governing bodies (of the Republic of Karakalpakstan, the 12 regions,\nand Tashkent city) implement policies with the use of the national and regional\nbudgets, non-budget sources, and other funds, to provide the conditions needed\nto live in the districts and cities in their territory.

As a result, the economic potential of the regions is not put to efficient\nuse, and the gap between the regions further widens (see Table 2).

All\nthese increase social tensions and mistrust of governing bodies. Hence, large\ndifferences in living standards between regions, though they may have objective\nreasons, must be reduced through central government policies.\n\nUnfortunately, no national program for the economic development of\nunderdeveloped regions has yet been drawn up, and specific regional features are\nnot thoroughly taken into account in program planning and implementation.\n\nSocial Organizations and Local Self-Governing Bodies:\nTheir Role in Solving the Problem of Regional Inequality\n\nThe community (makhallya) is the primary administrative and territorial\nunit, and therefore also the primary self-government unit. The makhallya is a\ntraditional association of families living in a neighborhood, established by the\nresidents  to  protect  their  interests  and  rights,  and  meet  their  needs.  It  is\nindependent of the local government system.\n\nOn average, each makhallya has around 1,500\u20132,000 members. More\nthan 25 members are directly involved in self-governance (through the assembly\ncouncil  formed  by  the  makhallya  members).  Only  two  of  the  25  are  paid\nsalaries out of the local (district or city) budget. The other members of the\nassembly  council  are  volunteers. Throughout  Uzbekistan,  7,501  such  self-\ngoverning bodies now exist.\n\nOver the years the makhallya has evolved into the main conduit for\nantipoverty programs of government. Since 1994, public funds have been\ndistributed among needy families through the makhallya, according to the\ndecision of the makhallya members and current legislation. This mechanism\nof state support to families is not hampered by bureaucratic barriers and\nfosters  the  spirit  of  voluntarism  in  the  purpose  and  payment  of  grants\n(Yunusov 2005).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n315\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\f316\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nOn 6 October 2005, the amount of $1,614,035 was made available to\nsocially vulnerable families in the Ferghana region, to help them in developing\ntheir family business. Of the 8,051 families that applied, 2,987 families were\ngranted micro credits. Each family received $500\u2013$700 for home production,\nhandicrafts, and livestock rising. By the end of October 2005, $1,535,614 of\nthe total amount had gone to micro credits. Jobs had been provided for 5,705\npeople (2,542 of them women).6 Such measures were adopted in Andijan,\nNamangan, and Ferghana regions, which are densely populated and therefore\nhave the most number of unemployed people in Uzbekistan.\n\nSelf-governing  bodies  must  therefore  involve  their  citizens  in  self-\ngovernment by making it possible for the interests and needs of individual\ncitizens and the entire community to be realized, and by ensuring economic\nindependence and stable funding for functions delegated by both the national\nand local governments.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe main goal of regional policies in Uzbekistan is the effective use of\nregional factors to ensure the sustainable economic development of the country,\nraise living standards, and lessen the socioeconomic disadvantages of various\nregions.\n\nThe  regions  of  Uzbekistan  differ  in  the  degree  of  socioeconomic\ndevelopment. The  differences  have  objective  and  subjective  reasons. The\nobjectives  are  concerned  with  differences  in  natural  resources,  production\ncapacity, infrastructure, economic structure and population distribution, and\nlevel of adaptation to market mechanisms. The subjective reasons relate to\nuneven investment, administrative regulation of socioeconomic processes, and\ninsufficiency  of  material,  technical,  and  financial  resources.  Economic\ndevelopment has been shown to have a direct bearing on the well-being of the\npopulation.\n\nSignificant  and  increasing  interregional  differences  in  socioeconomic\ndevelopment entail such negative consequences as reduced investment and\nhigh  unemployment  in  less-developed  regions,  growing  in-migration  into\nmore-developed regions, increased pressure on the labor market, lowered real\nincome in less-developed regions, and heightened poverty. All these reinforce\nsocial tensions and mistrust of governing bodies. Hence, large differences in\nliving standards between regions, though they may have objective reasons,\nmust be reduced through central state policies.\n\n6 Data analyzed by Shamshod Yunusov on the basis of official information on the Ferghana region\nfrom the Administration of Labour Business and Social Defence of the Population, October 2005.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n316\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\n\fReducing Socioeconomic Inequality in Uzbekistan\n\n317\n\nNational  governance  of  the  regions  does  not  fully  correspond  to  the\ndevelopment needs of the country. Governance is still mostly traditional. The\nstructure, functions, and practice of regional government bodies face increasing\nchallenge  with  deepening  administrative  reform  and  further  economic\nliberalization. One way of improving governance is through decentralization,\nwhich transfers responsibility from the center to local self-governing bodies,\nwhile also strengthening civil society organizations. Differences in economic\nand social development between regions can be equalized only through well-\nthought-out strategies for the efficient use of regional factors and competitive\nadvantages.\n\nTo achieve more equitable socioeconomic development in the regions,\npromote decentralization, and deepen administrative reforms in Uzbekistan,\na package of social programs is planned for 2005. The programs, aimed at\nensuring social stability and raising living standards, involve, among other\nthings, housing reforms, social support for vulnerable sectors of the population,\ntraining,  school  education,  provision  of  drinking  water  and  natural  gas  to\nrural inhabitants, development of children\u2019s sports, and increased employment.\nThe central Government has no economic development program for\nless-developed regions, and does not fully take the unique features of each\nregion into account in development planning and implementation.\n\nAll these show how much more the central Government, regions, and\nself-governing  bodies  in  Uzbekistan  have  to  do  to  promote  economic  and\nsocial development in Uzbekistan.\n\nNapsipag Session final.pmd\n\n317\n\n20/11/2006, 3:12 PM\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\f318\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nReferences\n\nAbaturov, Vicktor. 2005.

Smith3\n\nIntroduction\n\nForeign  direct  investment  (FDI)  is  seen  as  an  instrument  by  which\ncountries can gain access to the benefits of globalization (Azim and Uddin\n2001). In recent years, FDI has received singular attention in many developing\ncountries. The close integration of national economies, driven by worldwide\ncompetitive pressures, economic liberalization, and the opening up of new\nareas of investment, has helped many countries to attract FDI (IFC 1997).\nPolicy makers and multilateral organizations have increasingly emphasized\nthe importance of a sound investment climate and flow of FDI in promoting\neconomic growth in developing countries (Stern 2002).\n\nThe  climate  for  investment  is  determined  by  the  interplay  of  many\nfactors\u2014economic, social, political, and technological\u2014which have a bearing\non the operations of a business. The business environment has three main\nfeatures: macroeconomic conditions, governance, and infrastructure. The more\nfavorable these factors are to a firm\u2019s operation, the more likely it is that the\nfirm will invest in the economy and help create a bandwagon effect for others.\nBangladesh has long been trying to attract FDI. In the 1990s, Bangladesh\nachieved a growth rate far superior to that of most low-income countries and\npositioned itself with a better macroeconomic policy regime to attract FDI.\nThe Government introduced a generous program of incentives for investors.\nThe country experienced an upward trend in FDI inflow in the early 1990s,\nbut recently too little foreign capital has come in (Azim 1999, World Bank\n2005b). In gross FDI inflows as a share of gross development product (GDP)\nin the 1990s, Bangladesh was 137th out of 141 countries (World Bank 2005b).\n\n1\n\nSenior Lecturer, Department of Management, Monash University, Australia.\n\n2 Deputy Director, BCS Administration Academy, Dhaka, Bangladesh.\n3\n\nSenior Lecturer, Department of Management, Monash University, Australia.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n321\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f322\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nDespite a relatively liberal FDI regime, foreign investors are not interested in\nmoving  to  Bangladesh.  It  is  therefore  crucial  to  understand  the  major\nimpediments  that  distort  the  business  environment.  A  conducive  business\nenvironment\u2014with  well-functioning  factor  markets,  efficiently  run\ninfrastructure  services,  easy  market  entry  and  exit,  an  enabling  regulatory\nenvironment, access to information, and strong competitive pressures\u2014allows\nbusinesses to become productive, competitive, dynamic, and innovative (World\nBank  2005b).  In  view  of  these  considerations,  this  paper  investigates  the\nbusiness environment in Bangladesh and identifies critical factors, especially\neconomic governance issues, that affect the volume of FDI.\n\nFDI in Developing Countries\n\nThe preconditions of FDI have been addressed by a number of theories.\nAmong these theories are: the theory of market imperfection (Hymer 1960,\nDunlop  1999);  behavioral  theory  (Aharoni  1966,  Dunlop  1999);  product\nlife  cycle  theory  (Vernon  1977;  Hossain,  Islam,  and  Kibria  1999);\ninternalization theory (Buckley and Casson 1976); transaction cost theory\n(Williamson 1975, 1985); location-specific advantage (Franco 1971, 1974;\nPorter 1990); and eclectic theory (Dunning 1988). Caves (1971) argues that\nthrough FDI multinational corporations (MNCs) attempt to exploit firm-\nspecific assets in a foreign market. But FDI is more than merely moving capital\nacross borders; it offers certain advantages to both the host country and the\ninvestor.  Dunning  (1980,  1988)  argues  that  a  firm\u2019s  foreign  investment\ndecisions  are  influenced  mainly  by  firm-  and  location-specific  advantages.\nOpen-door economic policy (Singh and Jun 1995, Walder 1996),  market size\n(Lardy 1995, Milner and Pentecost 1996, Fittock and Edwards 1998),  political\nstability (Tesai 1994), and the host country\u2019s macroeconomic policy, tax regime,\nand regulatory practices are considered major determinants of FDI.\n\nFDI inflows generate jobs through new establishments and expanded\nactivities, and indirectly increase competition within domestic markets and\nfacilitate the transfer of improved technology and management techniques\n(Crone  and  Roper  1999).  For  the  investor,  the  potential  benefits  lie  in\npenetrating a new market, gaining access to raw materials, diversifying business\nactivity,  rationalizing  production  processes,  and  overcoming  some  of  the\ndrawbacks of exporting, such as trade barriers and transport costs. FDI also\nenables companies to learn about the host market and how to compete in it.\nTransaction cost theory (Williamson 1975, 1985; Buckley and Casson\n1976;  Caves  1971;  Caves,  Christensen  and  Diewert  1982)  explains  how\nmultinational  enterprises  (MNEs)  own  and  control  operations  abroad  to\nbenefit from diverse production locations and globalization of markets (Benito\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n322\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fThe Impact of Poor Governance on Foreign Direct Investment: The Bangladesh Experience\n\n323\n\nand Gripsurd 1992, Buckley and Casson 1976, Teece 1986). Similarly, Vernon\n(1966) and Dunlop (1999) argue that MNEs undertake production in different\ncountries to minimize production costs and expand globally. Firms therefore\nchoose  least-cost  locations  for  their  production  activities  (Buckley  1988).\nDunning (1980, 1988) suggests that the propensity of a firm to get involved\nin  international  production  depends  on  three  conditions:  ownership\nadvantages, location advantages, and internalization advantages.\n\nInternal factors in host countries are also important determinants. Tatoglu\nand Glaister (1998) classify the host country location\u2013related factors into two\ntypes. First are Ricardian-type endowments, which mainly comprise natural\nresources,  most  kinds  of  labor,  and  proximity  to  markets.  Second  are\nenvironmental variables, or the political, economic, legal, and infrastructural\nconditions in a host country.\n\nAccording to Dunning and Pearce (1988), FDI can be \u201cresource seeking\u201d\n(gaining access to local, natural, or human resources); \u201cimport substituting\u201d\n(producing  locally  instead  of  exporting  to  the  local  market);  an  \u201cexport\nplatform\u201d (providing a basis for exporting to a regional market); or \u201crationalized\nor vertically disintegrated\u201d (locating each stage of production where the local\ncosts  are  most  advantageous).  A  particular  investment  may,  however,  be\nmotivated by several of these factors at the same time.\n\nAn economy that offers long-term business prospects can influence an\nFDI decision, but the prospects need to be directly relevant to the profitability\nof the venture (Petrochilos 1989). The inflow of FDI to a host country depends\non the availability of location-specific factors and the opportunity to use those\nresources effectively. Overall, the factors that influence FDI decisions\u2014Porter\n(1990) called these \u201cfactor endowments\u201d\u2014can include the size and growth of\nthe host-country market, factor prices (labor, raw materials, etc.), economic\npolicies  (interest  rates,  exchange  rates,  taxes,  etc.),  profitability,  and  the\nprotection afforded to investing firms by tariffs and other measures.\n\nKey Features of the Investment Climate\n\nMajor factors that influence firms to choose to locate their investment\nin a particular developing country are macroeconomic factors, governance,\ninfrastructure, access to finance and international integration, political stability,\nknowledge infrastructure and labor-force skills, and technology.\n\nMacroeconomic Factors\n\nInvestment is driven by profit, and foreign investors will always prefer a\ncountry with a buoyant business sector (measured in terms of GDP growth\nrate, inflation rate, level of industrialization, etc.). There is an element of herd\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n323\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f324\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nmentality among foreign investors that tends to create a bandwagon effect in\na particular country. The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and some other\nEast Asian countries are recent examples of this phenomenon, and India now\nexerts a similar attraction. By contrast, Nepal, Bangladesh, and many other\nslow-growth Third  World  economies  have  so  far  received  very  negligible\namounts of FDI.\n\nGovernance\n\nA  country\u2019s  general  structure  of  governance  and  the  institutions  that\nregulate interactions between business and government determine the burden\nof compliance with government regulations, the quality of government services,\nand  the  extent  to  which  corruption  is  associated  with  the  procurement  of\nthese services. Recent empirical research confirms, for example, that measures\nof  corruption  are  significantly  and  negatively  related  to  inflows  of  FDI\n(Smarzynska and Wei 2000, Wei 2000, Stiglitz 2003).\n\nRegulations in developing countries may tend to be more complex and\nbureaucratic than necessary as a result of corruption, and often are not intended\nto correct market failures or protect consumers (World Bank 2005b). Djankov\net al. (2002) state that having more regulations is generally not associated\nwith better societal outcomes in developing countries. They also find that\nstricter regulation of entry is correlated with increased corruption and costs.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nThe better its infrastructure, the more attractive the host economy is to\nforeign investors. For example, the quality of transport and communication\nsystems can be estimated from expenditure on road transport (Hill and Munday\n1991).  Ernst  and  Young  (1992,  in  Dunlop  1999)  identify  the  following\ninfrastructure factors as important in attracting FDI:\n\n(cid:127) Good  base  of  related  and  supporting  industries  (suppliers,\nsubcontractors, university research center, business services, and raw\nmaterials)\n\n(cid:127) Good transport facilities (road, rail, and air) and port system\n(cid:127)\n\nLow  cost  and  availability  of  utilities  (telecommunications,  energy,\nand water)\n\n(cid:127) Existence of environmental regulations and procedures\n(cid:127) Availability of sites and premises\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n324\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fThe Impact of Poor Governance on Foreign Direct Investment: The Bangladesh Experience\n\n325\n\nIn  countries  with  poor  infrastructure,  businesses  must  devote  more\nresources  to  acquiring  information,  procuring  inputs,  and  delivering  their\nproducts to the market. This undermines their competitiveness at best, and at\nworst deters them from entering markets where they could otherwise operate\nefficiently.\n\nAccess to Finance and International Integration\n\nAccess to finance significantly influences a firm\u2019s propensity to invest.\nBusinesses invest in projects where the expected benefits exceed the cost of\ninvestment. However, this can be achieved only where businesses do not face\ncredit constraints unrelated to their own performance. Credit constraints are\nless  likely  in  countries  with  well-developed  and  well-functioning  financial\nsystems. Indeed, a great deal of research has shown the importance of financial\nsector development for growth (Levine 1997). A healthy financial system allows\nbusinesses to expand according to their expected potential, rather than their\ncurrent stock of cash. Thus, countries with well-developed financial systems\n(banks, stock and bond markets) tend to grow faster than countries with less-\ndeveloped systems (World Bank 2003).\n\nCountries that aggressively pursued integration with the global economy\n(such as Brazil, PRC, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, and Thailand)\ngrew more quickly in the 1990s than those that did not (World Bank 2003).\nIndeed, many studies find that openness to trade and FDI accelerates growth\n(Dollar and Kraay 2001, Frankel and Romer 1999).\n\nPolitical Stability\n\nPolitical certainty and transparency makes developing countries much\nmore likely to attract FDI. Political uncertainty in a potential host country\nmay unexpectedly change the rules of the game under which businesses operate\n(Butler and Joaquin 1998). Adverse consequences have a profound influence\non  multinational  corporations  (MNCs)  (Boddewyn  1988).  An  unstable\ngovernment or monetary and fiscal policies lead to greater uncertainty about\ninvestment outcomes and detract from firm value (Brewer 1983).\n\nPolitical factors like frequent changes of government, a political opposition\ncritical of foreign direct investment, lack of transparency in the public service,\nrabid  nationalism,  corruption,  and  the  possibility  of  terrorism  are  seriously\nconsidered by investors before making investment decisions (Azim and Uddin\n2001).  Mudambi  (1995)  says  that  business  and  political  risks  are  plausible\ndeterminants  of  FDI  location.  He  uses  variables  representing  the  regulatory\nenvironment, inflation, incidence of violent or peaceful power transitions, and\nhost-country relationships with other countries to proxy this risk factor.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n325\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f326\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nKnowledge Infrastructure and Labor Force Skills\n\nA  fundamental  requirement  of  economic  growth  is  the  knowledge\ninfrastructure and the level of human development in a country. Developing-\ncountry governments must therefore strengthen their human resources through\neducation,  training,  health,  and  social  services.  According  to  Reza  (1995)\ngovernments must first make a systematic assessment of their human resources\nbefore formulating any policy to attract FDI. Such an assessment should be\ndesigned to:\n\n(cid:127)\n\nIdentify critical shortages of skilled manpower in the various sectors\nof  the  economy  and  take  measures  to  address  the  reasons  for  the\nshortage,\n\n(cid:127) Develop knowledge development strategies for creating a skilled labor\nforce that foreign investors find advantageous for future growth, and\nSet  targets  for  human  resources  development  based  on  reasonable\nexpectations of growth.\n\n(cid:127)\n\nTechnology\n\nTechnological progress encourages innovation and attracts FDI. A well-\ndeveloped  technology  infrastructure  allows  the  implementation  of  better\nbusiness processes. It also involves a great deal of adaptation (Reza 1995). To\nsupport innovation, the public sector can undertake research and development\n(R&D) activities on its own or with private sector partners.\n\nWhether  singly  or  in  combination  the  factors  canvassed  above  set  a\nsubstantial policy agenda that developing countries wishing to attract FDI\nneed to address.\n\nResearch Method\n\nAn empirical study of 21 businesses was conducted in December 2004\nand  January  2005  to  collect  primary  data  on  the  investment  climate  in\nBangladesh. Thirty  structured  face-to-face  interviews  were  held  to  gather\ninformation. The study used a quantitative structure encompassing a wide\nrange of topics.\n\nThe  interviews  were  done  face-to-face  (rather  than  through  mailed\nquestionnaires) to achieve greater flexibility, a better response rate, and a clearer\nunderstanding of the questions among the respondents. Face-to-face contact\nwith the respondents was also considered valuable from a qualitative standpoint.\nThe interviewees came from two target groups\u2014foreign investors and\nlocal business experts, and researchers (see Table 1). A structured questionnaire\n(see Appendix) was prepared for 21 foreign firms operating in different places\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n326\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fThe Impact of Poor Governance on Foreign Direct Investment: The Bangladesh Experience\n\n327\n\nin Bangladesh. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data from\nnine other interviewees\u2014various experts, researchers, policy makers, and policy\nobservers in Bangladesh. The interviews with experts helped clarify issues arising\nfrom the policy regime and helped identify institutional dysfunction.\n\nTable 1: Distribution of Interview Sample\n\nNo. of Interviewees\n\nCategory\n\nForeign investors\n\nSenior representatives of Foreign Investors\u2019 Chamber of Commerce and\nIndustry of Bangladesh and Federation of Bangladesh Chamber of\nCommerce and Industry\n\nRepresentatives of research groups and the academe\n\nGovernment officials  (senior executives of BOI-2 and\nBEPZA-1, and Joint Secretary\u20131, Ministry of Commerce)\n\nTTTTTotalotalotalotalotal\n\n21\n\n3\n\n2\n\n4\n\n3030303030\n\nBOI= Board of Investment (Bangladesh), BEPZA= Bangladesh Export Processing Zone Authority.\n\nAnalytical Framework\n\nFifty-eight common questions were posed in each interview with the\ncompanies,  and  the  data  were  analyzed  with  the  use  of  two  statistical\ntechniques\u2014frequency  analysis  of  responses  and  weighted  index  for  the\nquestions.\n\nFrequency Analysis\n\nThe opinion survey elicited qualitative data. The interview responses\nwere classified into three groups. Two positive response levels (\u201cvery attractive\u201d\nand \u201cattractive\u201d) made up one group, and two negative perceptions (\u201cvery\nfrustrating\u201d and \u201cfrustrating\u201d) composed the other. The third group contained\nthe indifferent responses\u2014those that were neither positive nor negative . The\nfrequency of the three groups was calculated and reported. Missing values\nwere excluded from the analysis.\n\nWeighted Average of Responses\n\nBecause  the  frequency  method  would  have  given  equal  weight  to  all\nthree levels of response, weighted frequency analysis was used (see Appendix).\nFirst, the scores -2 and -1 were assigned to the two different levels of negative\nresponses,  the  scores  1  and  2  were  assigned  to  the  two  levels  of  positive\nresponses, while the score 0 was assigned to the indifference level. The weighted\napproach allows readers to understand at a glance trends in the perceptions of\nexecutives about the business environment in Bangladesh.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n327\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f328\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nInterview Design\n\nIn view of the position and role of the target groups in their organization,\ndata  were  collected  through  purposive  sampling,  from  December  2004  to\nJanuary 2005.\n\nOf the 21 foreign companies covered by the interviews, 10 were in Dhaka,\n6  in  Gazipur,  and  2  in  Narayanganj,  and  there  was  1  company  each  in\nHobiganj, Sunamgonj, and Chittagong.\n\nTwelve companies were from the manufacturing sector, two were financial\ninstitutions (banks), one was from the energy sector, and there were three\ncompanies each from the wholesale and retailing sector and the services sector.\nTable 2 shows the sector distribution of the companies.\n\nOf the companies surveyed, 43% were entirely devoted to the domestic\nmarket, while around 24% were exclusively export-oriented. The remaining\n33% operated in both domestic and export markets. More than one third\n(43%) of the respondent companies were fully owned foreign companies and\nthe rest (57%) were joint ventures.\n\nTable 2: Industry Sectors Surveyed\n\nCompanies\n\nNumber\n\nPercentage of Total\n\nSector\n\nManufacturing\nFinancial institution\nEnergy\nWholesale and retailing\nServices\nTTTTTotalotalotalotalotal\n\n12\n2\n1\n3\n3\n2121212121\n\n57\n10\n5\n14\n14\n100100100100100\n\nTo obtain in-depth information, the researchers followed a topic guide\nlike  the  semi-structured  questionnaires  for  the  other  interviewees.  The\nrespondents were thus encouraged to share their experiences, attitudes, needs,\nand ideas, and the interviewer could zero in on areas that the respondents\nconsidered important.\n\nThe following issues were considered in preparing the questionnaire for\nthe representatives of business and research groups, and government officials:\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\nFactors that generally influenced the firm to select Bangladesh for\nFDI or joint venture;\nProblems  and  difficulties  usually  experienced  when  considering\nBangladesh for FDI location;\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n328\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fThe Impact of Poor Governance on Foreign Direct Investment: The Bangladesh Experience\n\n329\n\n(cid:127) Government policies, incentives, and future plans for FDI;\n(cid:127)\n\nSuggestions  to  the  Government  in  relation  to  FDI  incentives  and\npolicies in Bangladesh;\nSuggestions to the Board of Investment and other facilitating agencies\nto promote FDI in Bangladesh;\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127) Major impediments to a better FDI climate in Bangladesh; and\n(cid:127)\n\nSuggestions  for  the  improvement  of  the  investment  climate  in\nBangladesh.\n\nAnalysis of the Data\n\nThe  study  revealed  that  Bangladesh  could  provide  a  favorable\nenvironment  for  foreign  investment,  as  the  overall  weighted  response  was\npositive, although the total weighted average score of 8.927 was at the lower\nend  of  the  range  (1\u201358)  for  an  attractive  location. This  means  that  while\nforeign investors in Bangladesh are not altogether satisfied with the business\nenvironment, there is hope for improvement.\n\nMacroeconomic Context\n\nThe macroeconomic factors together scored an average of 0.548, between\n\u201cneutral\u201d (0) and \u201cattractive\u201d (1). This score indicates that investors are not\nworried about the macroeconomic aspects. Among the macroeconomic factors,\ninflation (0.762) and exchange rate (0.619) were more promising to investors,\nfollowed by fiscal policy (0.476) and monetary policy (0.333). More than\n55% of the respondents found Bangladesh attractive in terms of inflation rate\n(81%), exchange rate (67%), and fiscal policy (57%), while about 52% said\nthat monetary policy was either \u201cneutral\u201d or \u201cfrustrating.\u201d\n\nInfrastructure\n\nThe overall negative perception (-0.152) of business executives indicates\nthe inadequacy of infrastructure. The high negative weighted score for poor\nand inefficient supply and service of power (-1.048) and ports (-0.762) is an\nespecially significant concern. More than 80% (17 out of 21) of the respondents\nwere  strongly  critical  and  said  that  electric  supply  in  the  country  was\nfrustratingly poor (\u201cvery frustrating\u201d to some). Most of the respondents relied\non private generators to ensure continuous power supply.\n\nAround  76%  of  the  respondents  also  expressed  dissatisfaction  and\nfrustration  with  the  poor  port  facilities  in  Bangladesh.  Frequent  strikes  in\nports, lack of modern equipment, corruption, container congestion, and similar\nproblems cause serious trouble for foreign investors.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n329\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f330\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nFixed-line phones were perceived to be scarce. But the availability of\nmobile phones partly offset the negative perceptions (overall positive weighted\nvalue of 0.286).\n\nMore than 60% of the respondents noted that the transport system was\nbelow average. The respondents were especially dissatisfied with the quality of\nrailroads and waterways. The weighted average score of transportation was -0.095.\nNatural gas is a very vital fuel resource in Bangladesh. It accounts for\nabout 70% of commercial fuel used in the country (Government of Bangladesh\n2003). More than 75% of the respondents (16 out of 21) rated Bangladesh\nattractive or very attractive because of its gas supply (average positive weighted\nvalue of 0.857).\n\nThe low overall weighted value for natural resources (0.206) indicates\nthat these are scarce and limited in quantity. But positive values were assigned\nto the availability of land (0.238), natural resources (i.e., gas, coal, etc.) (0.190),\nand raw materials (0.190). A significant number of respondents (about 90%)\nagreed that the Government should take more effective steps to maximize the\nuse of its natural resources and land.\n\nMarkets\n\nBangladesh has a very good domestic market, with very high prospects.\nAn overwhelming majority of the respondents (more than 90%) rated the\ndomestic market attractive (positive weighted average value of 1.429).\n\nIn addition, more than two thirds of the respondent companies (71%)\nbelieved that Bangladesh could gain much by making good use of the regional\nmarket. They said that the South Asian Free Trade Agreement could have a\npositive effect on the Bangladesh economy if only negotiations could be more\neffective. The  northeastern  part  of  India  is  an  especially  good  market  for\nBangladeshi products because of its proximity and the facilities of the port at\nChittagong.\n\nOpinions about the availability of local suppliers in Bangladesh were\nmixed (cumulative average of 0, indicating a situation that is neither good nor\nbad). More than 60% of the respondents (13 out of 21) gave a neutral rating\n(0) to this aspect, while the scores of the rest were equally divided between\n\u201cattractive\u201d (1) and \u201cfrustrating\u201d (-1).\n\nThe overall weighted value for the quality of local suppliers was positive\n(0.048) but close to zero. More than 75% of the respondents (16 out of 21)\neither gave this aspect a neutral rating (0) or said it was an attractive feature\n(1) of the country. However, the results indicate that there is much room for\nimprovement in the quality of local suppliers.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n330\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fThe Impact of Poor Governance on Foreign Direct Investment: The Bangladesh Experience\n\n331\n\nInterestingly  enough,  all  of  the  respondents  strongly  believed  in  the\nmarket prospects of Bangladesh, provided the environment could be made\nmore conducive to business. They rated the prospects of the domestic market\n\u201cattractive\u201d or \u201cvery attractive.\u201d The weighted average value of 1.381 is a good\nsignal for FDI.\n\nGlobal Integration\n\nAlthough the study results indicated a positive weighted value for global\nintegration (0.603), Bangladesh still needs to develop an industrial development\nstrategy for better integration with regional and global markets.\n\nAmong the three factors considered in this regard, the respondents pointed\nout the low level of integration with the regional economy (0.381) and the\nglobal economy (0.524). However, they were satisfied with bilateral investment\ntreaties (average weighted value of 0.905).\n\nMore  than  42%  of  the  respondents  rated  regional  integration  either\n\u201cneutral\u201d (0) or \u201cfrustrating\u201d ( 1), while alluding to the very good prospects of\nthe country in the regional market. About two thirds (66%) of the respondents\nhad positive attitudes toward integration with the global economy, adding\nthat more integration would be better for business.\n\nThe research findings correspond with the results of recent World Bank\nstudies on growth and export competitiveness, which likewise indicated low\nintegration, by most measures, with the global economy (World Bank 2005a).\nBangladesh  ranked  56th  out  of  62  countries  in  A. T. Kearney\u2019s  2004\nglobalization index (Table 3). In the area of economic integration, Bangladesh\nis not doing well (Foreign Policy 2004).\n\nKnowledge Infrastructure and Skills\n\nAlmost  every  respondent  expressed  dissatisfaction  with  access  to\ninformation and the dismal state of R&D. To start a new business or adopt\nany  business  strategy,  all  kinds  of  companies  require  sufficient  reliable\ninformation,  relevant  data,  and  proper  R&D.  The  data  indicate  that\nBangladesh lags behind in this aspect.\n\nThis factor was \u201cfrustrating\u201d (or even \u201cvery frustrating\u201d) to more than\n62% of the respondents. The remaining 38% gave it a neutral rating (no one\nmade a positive comment). The average weighted negative value was -0.762\nfor access to information and -0.571 for R&D.

Respondents had mixed\nopinions about the workers\u2019 skills and education (average positive value of\n0.333). More than 42% of the respondents rated Bangladesh \u201cattractive\u201d (1)\nin terms of the skill and education of its workers, while 47% gave this factor\na neutral rating (0) and about 9% declared it \u201cfrustrating\u201d (-1). One interesting\ncomment by respondents (about 75%) was that workers were very keen to be\ntrained.\n\nRegarding  the  availability  of  qualified  managers,  about  42%  of  the\nrespondents  considered  it  an  attractive  feature  of  the  country,  while  the\nremaining 58% thought this factor either neutral or frustrating. However, the\naverage weighted value was negative (-0.143).\n\nThe study also showed the unsatisfactory quality of education and training\nin Bangladesh. To a majority of the respondents (more than 80%), this factor\nwas \u201cneutral\u201d or \u201cfrustrating\u201d  (overall negative score of -0.190).\n\nA recent World Bank report indicated that Bangladesh still lags behind\non  most  human  development,  innovation,  and  knowledge  indicators,  and\nthis deficiency keeps labor productivity, growth, and wage levels down (2005).\n\nLegal and Regulatory Framework\n\nThis study considered the legal and regulatory framework as one, with\nnine related elements of regulations, including the court system, all of which\nhave a direct impact on the business environment. The overall weighted value\nwas positive (0.265), indicating that the rules and regulations themselves are\nfavorable to business. But, as the respondents pointed out, implementing the\nregulations or securing benefits through them is another matter. This gap was\ncause for dissatisfaction among the respondents.\n\nMore than two thirds (66%) of the respondents rated either \u201cattractive\u201d\n(1) or \u201cvery attractive\u201d (2), four out of nine aspects of the legal and regulatory\nframework. They gave a score of 0.714 to labor regulations,  0.714 to the fire\ndepartment, 0.9048 to environmental certification and 0.4762 to customs,\ntrade, and other government regulations.\n\nBut the respondents showed frustration with the court system of the\ncountry (average negative weighted value of -0.524. More than half of the\nrespondents  (52%)  found  the  court  practice  \u201cfrustrating\u201d  (-1)  or  \u201cvery\nfrustrating\u201d (-2), while about 42% gave a neutral rating (0). Moreover, two\nother aspects had negative average values: intellectual property rights (-0.190)\nand legal operational facilities (-0.048).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n333\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f334\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nHowever, the overall legal and regulatory framework in Bangladesh has\nbeen described as lax, with a positive weighted score, and was also criticized\nby  the  respondents.  According  to  the  World  Economic  Forum  report,  on\naverage, Bangladesh takes 30 days to clear procedures in relation to starting a\nnew business. The cost of these procedures is very high in Bangladesh (World\nEconomic Forum 2004).\n\nData from the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business project also suggest that\nstarting  a  new  firm  in  Bangladesh  is  relatively  costly,  although  hiring  and\nfiring workers is generally perceived to be easier than in most other developing\ncountries  in  East  and  South  Asia.  An  entrepreneur  must  complete  seven\nprocedures to start a firm\u2014the smallest number among a group of comparator\ncountries in Asia (Malaysia also has seven). But the cost of these procedures\namounts  to  77.6%  of  per  capita  income,  by  far  the  highest  among  these\ncountries (see figure).\n\nAnother statistic suggests that start-up regulations and utility connections\nare  relatively  more  difficult  in  Bangladesh  than  in  other  Asian  countries.\nExecutives  surveyed  for  the Global  Competitiveness  Report  2001/02  (World\nBank 2003) ranked Bangladesh 60th out of 75 countries with regard to the\ndegree of difficulty in starting a new business. This ranking is worse than that\nof all the comparator countries in East and South Asia.\n\nNumber of Procedures and Cost of Starting a Firm in Bangladesh\nand Comparator Countries, 2002\n\ns\ne\nr\nu\nd\ne\nc\no\nr\np\n \nf\no\n \nr\ne\nb\nm\nu\nN\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n77.6\n\n12\n\n8\n\n8\n\n7\n\n10\n\n10\n\n51.1\n\n7\n\n26.6\n\n15.7\n\n13.2\n\n14.5\n\n6.7\n\nBangladesh\n\nThailand Philippines Malaysia\n\nIndia\n\nSri\nLanka\n\nPeople\u2019s\nRepublic\nof China\n\nNo. of procedures\n\nCost as a percentage of gross national\nincome per capita\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\na\nt\ni\np\na\nc\n \nr\ne\np\n \ne\nm\no\nc\nn\ni\n \nl\na\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nn\n \ns\ns\no\nr\ng\n \nf\no\n \ne\ng\na\nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\np\n \na\n \ns\na\n \nt\ns\no\nC\n\nSource: World Bank (2003).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n334\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fThe Impact of Poor Governance on Foreign Direct Investment: The Bangladesh Experience\n\n335\n\nInstitutional Support\n\nThe overall weighted average value of the institutional support sector\nwas positive (0.262). Among the six elements of institutional support, only\nthe  cost  of  finance  had  a  negative  score  (0.286).  More  than  38%  of  the\nrespondents were frustrated at the high cost of finance in Bangladesh, while\nabout 57% gave a neutral response. Some of the respondents expressed the\nview  that  the  interest  rate  and  inflation  together  may  increase  the  cost  of\ncapital, and adversely affect business.\n\nSix out of the 21 respondents (28%) rated access to finance \u201cattractive,\u201d\nwhile more than 47% gave a neutral response (0.048). Some of the respondents\nsaid that they did not usually depend on financing from the host country, so\nthey were not that concerned about the accessibility and cost of capital.\n\nWith regard to modern banking, more than 42% of the respondents\nconsidered the facilities and services \u201cattractive,\u201d while 38% gave a neutral\nrating, and 19% declared themselves \u201cfrustrated\u201d (overall weighted score of\n0.238). However, among the factors related to finance and openness, the\nrespondents emphasized the low level of sophistication of the financial market\nand  services  by  international  standards,  as  well  as  the  inaccessibility  of\nfinancing.\n\nThe  foreign  investors  had  positive  opinions  about  the  tax  rates  and\nincentives offered by the Government of Bangladesh (average score of 0.857).\nAn overwhelming number of the respondents (more than 80%) were quite\nsatisfied with the tax rates and incentives for foreign investment. However,\nsome respondents also reported difficulties in gaining access to incentives.\n\nThe  respondents  had  mixed  reactions  to  the  facilitation  role  of\ngovernment agencies (average score of 0.2381). Out of the 21 respondents,\n10 (about 47%) had a positive reaction, while 6 (29%) were neutral and 5\n(24%) voiced their frustration. However, the majority of the respondents (more\nthan 70%) stated that the quality of services and authority of the government\nfacilitating  agencies  like  Board  of  Investment  (BOI),  Bangladesh  Export\nProcessing Zone Authority (BEPZA), and Export Promotion Bureau (EPB)\nneeded to be improved.\n\n The findings showed that, along with other factors, the cost of finance\nis a major obstacle to economic performance and the ability of the country to\nattract investments. The average real lending rate in Bangladesh is higher than\nthe real GDP growth rate and substantially more then the real lending rates of\ncompeting countries like India, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam\n(World Bank 2005b).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n335\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f336\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\n Political Uncertainty\n\nThe study covered five relevant aspects of the political environment, for\nwhich the average weighted value was -0.1714\u2014not conducive to business.\nThe political climate in Bangladesh is rife with warring political parties, strikes,\ndemonstrations, and pressure groups. In this connection, the Centre for Policy\nDialogue (CPD) raised the issue of the alarming drop in trust in politicians in\nits 2004 report on business competitiveness in the country.4\n\nHowever, most of the businesses were affected by strikes and other political\ndemonstrations. As much as 91% of the respondents were critical about this\naspect and rated it \u201cfrustrating\u201d or \u201cvery frustrating\u201d (average negative score\nof -1.333).\n\nPolitical uncertainty is another major concern, followed by economic\npolicy  uncertainty.  A  large  majority  of  the  respondents  (more  than  85%)\nexpressed frustration in this regard or had a neutral response (weighted average\nscore  of  -0.2381  for  political  instability  and  -0.1905  for  economic  policy\nuncertainty).\n\nThe study also revealed the equivocal attitude of the opposition parties\ntoward foreign investment (below-average score of 0.333). The majority of\nthe respondents ranked the attitude of the opposition parties either \u201cneutral\u201d\nor \u201cfrustrating,\u201d as the political parties used strikes and demonstrations for\nshort-term political gains. These tactics disrupted the entire supply chain and\nmajor  export  activities,  increasing  the  cost  of  production  and  market\nuncertainty.\n\nGovernance\n\nThe governance framework, a cluster of six factors, scored an average of\n-0.401,  far  below  expectations.  All  the  respondents  viewed  government\nattitudes toward foreign investment as either \u201cattractive\u201d or \u201cvery attractive.\u201d\nBut  the  performance  of  the  Government  and  the  public  sector  was  rated\nunsatisfactory. Most of the respondents mentioned burdensome administrative\nregulations, favoritism in policy decisions, and poorly managed contracts.\n\n4 The Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), a partner organization of the World Economic Forum for\nBangladesh, conducted a survey of 100 local and foreign companies in May\u2013June 2004 as part of its\ncontribution to the Global Competitiveness Report 2004\u20132005. In that report, the CPD mentioned\nthat almost all (98%) top executives (of surveyed companies) believe that public trust in financial honesty of\npoliticians is low and this belief has become stronger in 2004 (compared to previous years). The weighted response\nhas  declined  from  -2.43  to  -2.68  in  2004.  The  change  of  scores  between  these  two  years  is  also  statistically\nsignificant. As the score is closer to -3, the highest score, it is obvious that this perception is very strong. This is a\nstrong signal of the business community to the government and the politicians to work on improving such bad/\nnegative image of the politicians. (CPD 2004). This indicated that investors were worried and unhappy about the\npolitical environment.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n336\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fThe Impact of Poor Governance on Foreign Direct Investment: The Bangladesh Experience\n\n337\n\nThe findings indicate weak economic governance\u2014a major reason for\nthe  poor  performance  of  Bangladesh.  Economic  governance  here  refers  to\nquality of public service delivery and public private dealings that directly affect\nthe operations of the foreign firms. The problem of endemic corruption is\nundeniable and it has a significant impact on business and on FDI. Two out\nof the 21 respondents did not comment about corruption. The rest (89%)\nranked corruption as \u201cfrustrating\u201d or \u201cvery frustrating\u201d (overall weighted score\nof -1.263). Firms reported having to make unofficial payments (bribes) to\nprocure various government permits, gain access to public utilities (telephone,\nelectricity, gas), get customs clearance (import and export permits), make tax\npayments, or file tax returns.\n\nA large proportion of the respondents (more than 85%) commented\nthat the bureaucratic procedures and regulatory and administrative bottlenecks\nwere directly affecting the day-to-day operations of their firms. Bureaucratic\ncontrol had an overall weighted average value of  0.9524, giving a clear sense\nof the burden that governance problems impose on firms.\n\nThe study also revealed the dissatisfaction of respondents with law and\norder, security, and cooperation between government agencies. About 42% of\nthe respondents rated law and order \u201cfrustrating\u201d (on account of the high\nincidence  of  crime,  theft,  and  other  disorders),  while  47%  had  neutral\ncomments (overall average value of -0.333).\n\nThe majority of the respondents (52%) expressed apprehension about\noverall security (referring to both personal security and security of property),\nwhile 42% gave a neutral response (weighted average of -0.4762). Almost\nhalf  of  the  respondents  (48%)  expressed  frustration  with  the  degree  of\ncooperation between government agencies, like customs, tax, and police, while\n52% made neutral remarks (average value of -0.524). No one had a very good\nimpression of these agencies.\n\nA number of studies have been conducted by international organizations\n(World  Bank,  Asian  Development  Bank,  World  Economic  Forum,\nTransparency International, Centre for Policy Dialogue, Bangladesh Enterprise\nInstitute) on the problems of governance in Bangladesh. In most cases their\nfindings coincide with the empirical findings of this study.\n\nFDI Climate in Bangladesh\n\nRespondents  were  asked  to  rank  the  major  factors  that  motivate\ncompanies to do business in Bangladesh.

As  listed  in Table  5,  the  main  obstacles  to\ninvestment are corruption, red tape, and political unrest.

The  factors  evaluated  positively  by\ninvestors  were  market  prospects,  availability  of  labor,  labor  productivity,\nincentives for investors, and language and culture.\n\nBut respondents painted a bleak picture of economic governance. They\nhad  significant  inhibitions  about  investment  because  of  perceptions  of\ncorruption, bureaucratic red tape, strikes and other political demonstrations,\ninadequate infrastructure, law and order difficulties, policy uncertainty, and\nlow  access  to  information.  These  factors  dulled  the  attractions  of  the\ncompetitive, market-driven environment.\n\nThe findings of this research correspond with observations of the World\nEconomic Forum (WEF) (2004). The WEF survey suggested that Bangladesh\nranked among the lowest in effectiveness of bankruptcy law (96th out of 102\ncountries)  and  in  business  competitiveness  (80th  out  of  102).  In  a  recent\nreport, the WEF ranked Bangladesh on list of most competitive economies to\nthe 99th. The ranking is based on various factors affecting a nation\u2019s business\nenvironment and economic development. In the last year, Bangladesh\u2019s position\nwas 98th among 117 countries. According to the WEF report released on 26\nSeptember  2006,  Bangladesh  ranked  121st  in  institutions  and  117th  in\ninfrastructure.  The  report,  however,  recognized  the  country\u2019s  better\nperformance in macroeconomy as it ranked 47th in this sub-index. In South\nAsia, Bangladesh is the only country that failed to retain its previous position.\nThe WEF ranking was based on a survey of over 11,000 business leaders in\n125 countries. The survey was conducted to examine the range of factors that\ncan affect an economy\u2019s business environment and development as it seeks to\nmaintain  economic  growth  including  the  levels  of  judicial  independence,\nprotecting  property  rights,  government  favoritism  in  policy  making  and\ncorruption (The Daily Star 28 September 2006).\n\nTaken together with the findings of such studies, the analysis here suggests\nthat the FDI potential of Bangladesh may be realized with the help of public\npolicy and management agendas that improve governance generally, coordinate\nthe  instruments  of  economic  governance,  and  ensure  more  effective  and\naccountable public management.\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n339\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\f340\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nReferences\n\nAharoni, Y. 1966.The Foreign Investment Decision Process, Boston: Division of\nResearch,  Graduate  School  of  Business  Administration,  Harvard\nUniversity.\n\nAzim, M.

The Survey Mechanics\n\nStructure of the Questionnaire\n\nThe questionnaire contained mostly structured close-ended questions\nwith  a  five-point  response  scale. The  response  scale  represented  the  entire\nspectrum of possible views, from extremely negative (\u201cvery frustrating\u201d) to\nextremely  positive  (\u201cvery  attractive\u201d). The  middle  of  the  scale  represented\ncompletely neutral views.\n\nThe points were defined precisely to facilitate an exact response. \u201cVery\nattractive\u201d was defined as a situation where no further improvement was needed.\n\u201cAttractive\u201d meant that the situation was quite satisfactory but improvement\nwas  expected.  \u201cNeutral\u201d  represented  a  situation  where  the  respondent  was\nundecided whether to respond positively or negatively. \u201cFrustrating\u201d indicated\na situation where there was enough room for improvement, but it would take\nmuch time. \u201cVery frustrating\u201d was defined as a situation that was very bleak\nand hopeless.\n\nIn  addition  to  a  description  of  the  company,  the  11  sections  of  the\nquestionnaire  contained  58  questions  pertaining  to  the  macroeconomic\ncontext,  infrastructure,  markets,  integration,  natural  resources,  human\nresources, legal and regulatory framework, institutional support, governance\nframework, political setting, and social setting. A separate open-ended section\nwas intended to generate more information.\n\nRespondents were also requested to cite the most common motivating\nfactors and problems that affect decisions to do business in Bangladesh. In\nline  with  the  inductive  studies  on  FDI  in  developing  counties  and  the\npeculiarities  of  the  Bangladesh  economy,  the  researcher  identified  some\nenvironmental factors that were more likely to influence the operations of\nforeign firms in Bangladesh.\n\nCalculation of Weighted Average of Responses\n\nTo estimate the weighted average of responses, the following were defined:\n\nfi= Frequency of response belonging to the ith response level (i = 1,2,...,5)\n                         {-2, if very frustrating, with negative side response\n                         {-1, if frustrating, with negative side response\n  Scores, xi =     {0, if indifferent between the two answers\n                         {1, if attractive, with positive side response\n                         {2, if very attractive, with positive side response\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n344\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fThe Impact of Poor Governance on Foreign Direct Investment: The Bangladesh Experience\n\n345\n\nThen, the weighted response (Rw) was defined as\n                 Rw=  (cid:200)fixi /(cid:200)fi (i = 1,2,...,5)\n\nThe value 0 of Rw was considered the demarcation value between the\naverage positive and negative side response. If Rw>0, the response was positive\noverall; if Rw<0, the response was considered negative. However, the distance\nof the score of the response from 0 showed a relatively stronger opinion on a\nparticular aspect of the business environment.\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n345\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\f346\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nE-governance in Bangladesh:\nA Scrutiny from the Citizens\u2019 Perspective\n\nShah Mohammad Sanaul Hoque1\n\nIntroduction\n\nInformation and communication technology (ICT) applications in public\nadministration, among other areas, have achieved transparent, responsible,\naccountable,  participatory,  and  responsive  governance  in  many  countries.\nInnovative ICT applications also allow information and public services to be\ndelivered at the citizens\u2019 convenience. Ways of integrating new technologies\ninto public administration to modernize systems, ensure good governance,\nand enhance democratic practices are now commonly discussed as e-governance\nhas become popular worldwide.\n\nICT in Bangladesh\n\nIn  Bangladesh,  computer-aided  applications  were  first  introduced  in\npublic  sector  organizations  in  the  1980s,  but  only  in  a  very  few  agencies,\nwhere  the  applications,  installed  in  stand-alone  personal  computers,  were\nmostly limited to providing support for management information systems,\nreporting, payroll, accounting, and budgeting. The concept of e-governance\ncame late to the country and has not yet been discernibly adopted in public\nadministration.\n\nObjectives\n\nThis  paper  looks  at  the  e-governance  posture  of  the  Government  of\nBangladesh from the standpoint of benefits to its citizens. Specifically, it reviews\n(i) how the policies and strategies of the country protect the citizens\u2019 interests\nin  e-governance,  and  (ii)  how  the  citizens  have  benefited  so  far  from\ne-governance initiatives.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe  paper  is  exploratory  and  descriptive,  and  uses  qualitative  and\nquantitative data collected from both primary and secondary sources. Various\nresearch  techniques,  procedures,  and  methods  were  used  in  collecting,\n\n1\n\nSystems Analyst (Deputy Secretary), Bangladesh Public Administration Training Centre (BPATC),\nDhaka, Bangladesh.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n346\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fE-governance in Bangladesh: A Scrutiny from the Citizens\u2019 Perspective\n\n347\n\nprocessing, analyzing, and presenting data on various aspects. To attain the\nobjectives of the paper, many administrative studies, reports, and development\nplans were reviewed to find out how those provide policy guidelines for reforms\nby integrating modern technologies into governance and development, and\nto extract the major trends and features of e-governance in the country. A\nlimited survey was conducted in 36 ministries and divisions in the Bangladesh\nsecretariat  to  identify  the  focus  of  current  e-governance  initiatives  and  to\nunderstand how new electronic means of communication are being used to\nbring citizens closer to the public administration. The Web sites of 20 selected\nministries  and  divisions  were  also  reviewed  to  find  out  how  these  provide\ninformation and services to the people.\n\nToward Reform and Development\n\nAdministrative Reforms and ICT\n\nAn efficient, transparent, and accountable public sector, greater focus\non the citizenry, reorganization, simplified procedures and forms, and the use\nof modern technology to improve governance\u2014these are some areas of public\nadministration  that  have  long  been  discussed  in  Bangladesh.  Many\nadministrative reports and documents, including the early ones, have advocated\nthese reforms in governance.\n\nAlthough ICT in its modern form had not yet emerged at the time, the\nreport of the Administrative and Service Reorganisation Committee, formed\nin 1972, observed that \u201cProgress in science and technology and the vast amount\nof new knowledge have made a major impact on the tasks of the Government\nand on the process of decision-making\u201d (Government of Bangladesh 1973,\npage  2). The  report  suggested  the  creation  of  a  permanent  body  \u201cfor  the\ncontinuous study for the simplification of the forms and procedures with a\nview to removing the hardships the people have to undergo because of the\ncumbrous forms and complicated procedures\u201d (Government of Bangladesh\n1974, page 1). The report of the Public Administration Efficiency Study in\n1989  recommended  the  modernization  of  government  offices  and  the\nimprovement of the file management system and office operations through\nthe use of computers and the training of the workforce in the new technology\n(Government  of  Bangladesh  1989a,  pages  14\u201317).  Another  report  on\nadministrative reform, prepared by four secretaries of the Government in 1993,\nsuggested the increased use of modern office equipment, including computers,\nfor efficiency and transparency in the public sector (Rahman et al. 1993,\npage 96). In 2000, the report of the Public Administration Reform Commission\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n347\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f348\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nspecifically called for the use of modern technologies in \u201celectronic government.\u201d\n(Government of Bangladesh 2000, page xvii). The report pointed out:\n\nTo ensure customer services of a particular department or organisation all\ninformation, procedures, list of services obtainable, and requirement for\nthe services can be preserved in the computer at the reception from where\na customer can easily get information on the status of the services he/she\nhas sought (Government of Bangladesh 2000, pages 11\u201312).\n\nThese reports, and many others, attempted to identify long-standing\nissues and problems in Bangladesh public administration and to offer ways of\naddressing  them.  Many  of  the  suggestions  endorsed  the  use  of  modern\ntechnology  to  improve  governance.  Some  of  the  suggestions  have  been\nimplemented and the structure of the civil service has changed. But internal\nprocedures, work methods, logistical support have received limited attention\n(Government of Bangladesh 1989b, page 1).\n\nICT for National Development\n\nFive-Year Plans. The Five-Year Plan also calls for the use of technology\nfor effective public administration in Bangladesh. The Fourth Five-Year Plan\nadvocates  \u201cincreas[ing]  the  comparative  strength  of  the  economy  through\ncontinuous  technological  innovations  and  adaptations\u201d  (Government  of\nBangladesh 1991, pages xxii\u20135). It draws attention to the use of technology in\nrecords management, personnel management, and financial management in\nthe public sector, and specifically mentions the computerization of some public\norganizations.  \u201cThe  Bangladesh  Computer  Council  will  promote  use  of\ncomputer and information technology, provide advisory and technical services\nto different organizations and standardize computerization and information\ntechnology\u201d (Government of Bangladesh 1991, pages xxii\u20136). Categorically\nemphasizing  the  need  to  prepare  the  public  workforce  to  use  the  new\ntechnologies, this plan states: \u201cAdministrative training at all levels should now\ncover the area of technology as well\u201d (Government of Bangladesh 1991, pages\nxxii\u20135).\n\nThe Fifth Five-Year Plan, on the other hand, takes the strategy, among\nothers,  of  \u201cexposing  the  country  as  a  whole  to  the  process  of  change  and\nprogress at the frontiers of production, development, knowledge, market and\nchanges through the information technology\u201d (Government of Bangladesh\n1998,  page  533).  Particularly  in  organization  development,  personnel\nmanagement, and system improvement, the plan acknowledges the importance\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n348\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fE-governance in Bangladesh: A Scrutiny from the Citizens\u2019 Perspective\n\n349\n\nof \u201cextend[ing] computer facilities to government organizations\u201d (Government\nof Bangladesh 1998, page 549) and sets the objective of \u201cintroduc[ing] large-\nscale technological changes in all public organizations with computerization\nthat will foster modern record-keeping, filing and other office procedures\u201d\n(Government of Bangladesh 1998, page 552). It recognizes the need to build\nthe capacity of the public workforce to keep up with technological changes,\nand states: \u201cAll officers should be able to operate computers\u201d (Government of\nBangladesh 1998, page 556).\n\nPoverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper.  The  impact  of  ICT  on  good\ngovernance, economic growth, people\u2019s empowerment, and poverty reduction\nis acknowledged in the National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction\n(Government of Bangladesh 2004, pages 106\u2013110). The strategy recognizes\nthat  ICT  \u201chas  capabilities  to  overcome  barriers  of  social,  economic  and\ngeographical isolation, increase access to information and education, and enable\npoor people to participate in more of the decisions that affect their lives.\u201d It\nemphasizes the need to convert the vast population, rural as well as urban,\ninto human resources trained in ICT and connected by adequate and efficient\nICT infrastructure to the global village.\n\nMany administrative reform studies and the Government\u2019s midterm and\nlong-term development plans and strategies acknowledge the need to integrate\nICT  into  administration  and  development  activities.  Yet,  those  plans  and\nstrategies do not say how this should be done. More efforts are needed to map\nout specific routes for incorporating ICT particularly in public administration.\n\nICT Policy\n\nThe national ICT policy adopted by the Government in 2002, among\nother things, sets policy guidelines for introducing e-governance in Bangladesh.\nThe  ambitious  goal  is  to  build  a  knowledge-based  society  by  2010.  A\nnationwide  IT  infrastructure  is  also  to  be  developed  to  give  access  to\ninformation to every citizen, to empower the people and enhance democratic\nvalues and standards for sustainable economic development. The policy is yet\nto be accompanied by specific strategies or action plans for bringing lasting\nbenefits to the public. But there are apparent moves to prepare a national\ne-governance strategy.\n\nOfficial Internet Connection and Usage Policy\n\nThe  Government\u2019s  Internet  connection  and  usage  policy,  adopted  in\n2004,  provides  for  the  use  of  Internet  facilities  in  government  offices  and\ndetermines its management and financial aspects, such as entitlement, approval\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n349\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f350\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nprocedures, and cost limits. But the policy does not deal with operational\naspects (rules for the effective use of the Internet) and therefore does not say\nhow the new communication channels should be used to connect and serve\nthe citizens and engage their participation. A limited survey in this regard\nshowed that practice of electronic correspondence has generally not yet caught\non among the ministries and divisions in the Bangladesh secretariat.\n\nTable 1:  E-mail Communication by the Ministries and Divisions\n\n(No. of Respondents = 32)\n\nDegree of Frequency (% of Responses)\n\nE-Mail Correspondent\n\nExclusively Mostly Sometimes Rarely Never\n\nScore\n\nOwn department/agency\nOther ministries/divisions\nForeign missions and\norganizations\nNGOs and civil society\nGeneral public\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n12.5\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n50.0\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.0\n3.1\n\n31.3\n21.9\n0.0\n\n50.0\n40.6\n\n6.3\n50.0\n16.7\n\n50.0\n56.3\n\n0.0\n28.1\n72.2\n\n50.0\n46.8\n\n268.9\n93.8\n16.7\n\nNGO = nongovernment organization\nNotes: Score provides the sum of the row where each cell is multiplied by  corresponding values assigned to the categories\nas: exclusively = 4, mostly = 3, sometimes = 2, rarely = 1, never = 0.\n\nAs Table 1 shows, e-mail correspondence is rare within and between the\nministries and divisions, and between the ministries and divisions, on the one\nhand, and nongovernment organizations and civil society, on the other. E-mail\nis  exchanged  mostly  with  foreign  organizations.  More  than  72%  of  the\nministries and divisions in the Bangladesh secretariat have never communicated\nwith the general public through e-mail.\n\nNational Commitment to Strengthening the ICT Sector\n\nNevertheless,  the  Government  has  made  ICT  a  strategic  sector  for\neconomic development and identified ICT applications as important tools in\nachieving public administration goals. The Prime Minister in 2002 turned\nthe  Ministry  of  Science  and Technology  into  the  Ministry  of  Science  and\nInformation and Communication Technology to link Bangladesh with ICT\nprogress worldwide. Import duty and tax on computers and accessories were\nremoved to make technology more affordable and to facilitate the diffusion\nand  adoption  of  ICT  in  the  country.  This  overt  commitment  of  the\nGovernment to the development of the ICT sector is a basic strength in the\nintroduction of e-governance in Bangladesh.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n350\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fE-governance in Bangladesh: A Scrutiny from the Citizens\u2019 Perspective\n\n351\n\nE-governance Initiatives\n\nManagement Structures\n\nThe  Government  has  also  made  efforts  to  institute  e-governance  in\npractice. The National ICT Task Force (NTF), headed by the Prime Minister,\nis the highest policy-making and oversight body for the ICT sector at the\nnational  level.  Immediately  below  it  is  the  Executive  Committee  on  ICT,\nformed on 21 March 2002 to strengthen the ICT sector with the ultimate\ngoal of national development. Focal points and committees for e-governance\nhave also been formed in every ministry and are now preparing road maps for\nthe  introduction  of  e-governance  in  their  respective  sectors.  Besides  these\nbodies, key ministries and specialized agencies set strategic directions as well.\n\nStrategic Directions for E-governance\n\nAt its very first meeting, the NTF, eager to define an appropriate vision\nand mission for the IT sector in Bangladesh, formed a committee for this\npurpose under the leadership of the minister of the then Ministry of Science\nand Technology. The NTF also formed another committee to identify targets\nand draw up an action plan for human resources development in the sector.\nStill, these initiatives were made with the commercial growth of the IT sector\nin mind; the governance perspective had yet to be considered. However, at its\nthird meeting on 8 August 2002, the NTF paid particular attention to the\nissues of connectivity, regulation, and e governance. The fifth NTF meeting\ndealt specifically with e-governance. The ministries and divisions could start,\nso  the  discussions  went,  by  identifying  specific  e-governance  services  and\ngradually  mature  through  outsourcing.  Regulatory  actions  also  had  to  be\nexpedited to standardize the Bengali keyboard.\n\nOn  the  other  hand,  among  the  major  efforts  it  has  taken  so  far,  the\nExecutive  Committee  has  launched  an  umbrella  project  in  e-governance,\nformed  e-governance  focal  points  in  the  various  ministries  and  divisions,\narranged for the preparation of a draft ICT act, and amended the Copyright\nAct.  Besides,  as  decided  by  the  NTF,  the  principal  secretary  to  the  Prime\nMinister,  who  also  chairs  the  Executive  Committee,  has  requested  all  the\nministries and divisions, through their focal points and teams, to formulate\nand implement integrated road maps for e-governance. These road maps are\nnow being finalized for the various sectors. Table 2 lists the official directives\nthat carry strategic value for the introduction of e-governance in Bangladesh.\nE-governance in Bangladesh is evidently still at a very early stage, and\nthe specific management structures have yet to be expressly defined by the\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n351\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f352\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nTable 2: Government Guidelines for E-governance\n\nTopics Covered\n\nFocus\n\nIssuing Authority,\nDocument No., and\nIssue Date\n\nMinistry of Science and ICT No:\nSecretary-1/2001/442, dated 7\nJanuary 2002\n\nNationwide expansion of IT\n\nPreparatory (HRD)\n\neducation; IT professionals;\nIT institutes\n\nChanges in laws\n\nPreparatory (legal framework)\n\nAssistance from nonresident\n\nPublic-private partnership\n\nBangladeshis, private sector,\nand NGOs\n\nMinistry of Science and ICT No:\nSec-13/IT-47/2002  (Part-2)/117,\ndated 29 March 2003\n\nSurvey of facilities, resources,\nWeb sites, including their\nproblems and needs\n\nPreparatory\n\nMinistry of Science and ICT No:\nSec-13/computer-7/97/273,\ndated 12 July 2003\n\nStandardization of public Web\nsites; functional design\nparameters for public Web sites\n\nStandardization of Web sites\n\nG2G, G2B, G2C\n\nPrime Minister\u2019s Office No:\n33.34.07.00.03.01.2003-75,\ndated 20 April 2004\n\nRegular updating of Web sites\n\nG2G, G2B, G2C\n\nImportance and Government\n\nGovernment commitment\n\nEnhancement of efficiency and\n\nG2G and G2C\n\ncommitment\n\nservices to citizens\n\nemployees\n\nIT training for public sector\n\nPreparatory (capacity building)\n\nCreation of focal points and teams\n\nPreparatory (key sectoral players)\n\nShort- and long-term actions:\n\nPreparatory (sectoral road map\n\ntraining and HRD, connectivity,\ncyber laws, interface with\ncitizens, etc.\n\nand priority areas)\n\nExamples of activities for online\n\nG2C (Web content and priority)\n\npublication;\n\nOne-stop payment of utility bills\n\nG2C (one-stop service)\n\ncontinued on next page\n\nGovernment.  As  a  result,  strategic  directions  for  e-governance  come  from\ndifferent authorities. E-governance in Bangladesh is also concerned mostly\nwith simple preparatory guidelines. However, these preparatory guidelines do\nnot yet adequately cover the citizen-centered aspect of e-governance.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n352\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fE-governance in Bangladesh: A Scrutiny from the Citizens\u2019 Perspective\n\n353\n\nTable 2: Government Guidelines for E-governance (cont\u2019d)\n\nTopics Covered\n\nFocus\n\nIssuing Authority,\nDocument No., and\nIssue Date\n\nMinistry of Establishment.\nNo: MOE (PACC)-e-mail/\n2001-108, dated 26 May 2004\n\nMinistry of Establishment No:\nMOE (PACC)-E-Governance \u2013\n203/2004-148, dated 5 May 2005\n\nUse of e-mail in governmental\n\ncommunications\n\nG2G (no specific suggestions\nfor communicating with\nbusinesses and citizens)\n\nGuidelines for short-term and\n\nPreparatory guidelines\n\nlong-term actions to be taken by\nall ministries and divisions\n\nDevelopment and updating of Web\n\nG2G, G2B, G2C\n\nsites\n\nConnectivity infrastructure for the\n\nConnectivity\n\nsecretariat and Internet\nconnections in all district offices\n\nTraining for civil servants\n\nPreparation of the workforce\n\nE-governance road map\n\nStrategic guidelines\n\nIntroduction of Bengali on the\n\nUser-friendly Web presence\n\nInternet\n\nPublic-private partnership;\nopen-source policy\n\nStrategic option\n\nExpansion of ICT education\n\nPreparation of citizens\n\nG2B = government to business, G2C = government to citizens, G2G = government to government, HRD = human resources\ndevelopment, ICT = information and communication technology, IT = information technology\n\nFocus of E-governance Projects\n\nSome e-governance projects have already started. Currently, 38.9% of\nthe ministries and divisions in the Bangladesh secretariat have at least one\nproject  that  either  resulted  directly  from  e-governance  initiatives  or  will\nsomehow facilitate future e governance efforts. On the other hand, 16.7% of\nthe ministries and divisions are just launching e-governance projects, while\n44.4% have no e-governance project at all. Except for one, no ministry has\ncompleted any e-governance project so far. As the responses of 142 ministries\nand divisions in the Bangladesh secretariat show, current e-governance drives\nare concerned mainly with planning and strategy formulation, connectivity\nand  infrastructure,  procurement  of  technology,  and  Web  site  creation.\n\n2 Most of the respondents from the sample ministries/divisions were reluctant or declined to respond,\nsaying that their e-governance drive was too rudimentary for them to determine the areas of attention\nor that they had had no knowledge in this regard. Only 14 ministries/divisions filled out this part of\nthe questionnaire.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n353\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f354\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nTable 3 shows that better use of technology and human resources development\nreceive only inert attention.

The World Bank (1996, page 102) noted:\n\nMost industrial and developing countries now regularly consult concerned\ncitizen groups. In the UK, for example, the Government informs the people\nof proposed policies through series of \u2018white\u2019 or \u2018green\u2019 papers. In the US,\nbefore Congress starts formal consideration of the budget, the proposals\nare made public several months ahead of the fiscal year.\n\nThis practice has now become easier and more comprehensive through the\nInternet. Government can publish information and connect people through\nWeb  sites.

Two of the Web sites are still being developed and simply display\nblank home pages. However, the survey covered only the 36 ministries and\ndivisions  within the  Bangladesh secretariat. Of these 36, only 20 (55.6%)\nhave Web sites, including some still under construction.\n\nAppearance and Contents of the Web Sites\n\nThe  Government  adopted  official  Web  design  parameters  as  early  as\nJuly 2003 to standardize the appearance, menu, and contents of public Web\nsites. Yet, the ministries and divisions follow their own preferences in designing\ntheir Web sites. As a result, the sites do not have the same look and feel, and\nare difficult to access and browse.

Publications,  reports,\nregulations, and public documents are simply listed; and the lists are often\nincomplete. Only four of the ministries/divisions (20%) offer public forms\non their Web sites; however, they do not provide many features that could\nbenefit the citizens and attract wider use.\n\nInteractive Functions\n\nFor interactive functions, the official guidelines suggest three options:\nqueries  and  complaints;  comments,  suggestions,  and  compliments;  and\nstatistical queries with a pull-down menu. As can be seen from Table 5, the\nexisting Web sites have practically no interactive features so far.\n\nTable 5: Interactive Functions of the Web Sites\n(No. of Respondents = 20)\n\nOption\n\nExists(%)\n\nComment\n\nFAQ only.\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\nQueries, complaints\nComments, suggestions, compliments\nStatistical queries, pull-down menu\n\nFAQ = frequently asked questions\n\nPurpose and Benefits of the Web Sites\n\nGiven the foregoing observations, the present Web sites narrowly serve a\npublic  administration  purpose  and  hardly  bring  benefits  to  businesses  or\ncitizens. Table 6 shows that the sites have yet to take on features that appeal to\nthese groups and to other users in Bangladesh.\n\nTable 6:  Purpose and Benefits of Web Sites\n\nStatus, Purpose, or Benefit\n\nNumber Percentage\n\nComment\n\nUnder construction\nMere presence\nOrganizational information only\nTender notice/documents for\n\nbusiness sector and\norganizational information\n\nSome useful information, documents.\nor rules and regulations for citizens,\nincluding organizational information\n\nFew useful forms for citizens and\norganizational information\n\n1\n3\n7\n3\n\n4\n\n2\n\nG2B = government to business, G2C = government to citizens\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\nInformative.\nInformative; also carry, in a very\nlimited sense, G2B  aspect.\nHowever, 2 sites were found to\ncarry outdated notices.\n\nInformative, and with a nominal\n\nG2C purpose.\n\nInformative, and with a nominal\n\nG2C purpose.\n\n5\n20\n0\n\n5\n15\n35\n15\n\n20\n\n10\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n356\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fE-governance in Bangladesh: A Scrutiny from the Citizens\u2019 Perspective\n\n357\n\nOverall, public Web sites in Bangladesh do not have a common look\nand  feel.  On  the  other  hand,  their  contents  do  not  meet  the  government\nguidelines. Public information and forms are not adequately available, online\nservices are not offered, and the desired interactive functions do not yet exist.\nRather,  the  sites  mostly  provide  detailed  information  on  organizational\nstructure, hierarchy, activities, achievements, top personnel, etc., all of which\ntend to continue the legacy of traditional governance. The sites, as they are,\ntherefore hold little value for the people, given their needs and choices, and\ncannot attract a wide range of active users. Fresh ideas and sensible efforts are\nrequired to engage the interest and participation of the citizens.\n\nAvailability of Technologies and Connectivity\n\nAs a result of specific measures and steps taken by the Government in\nrecent years, technology and connectivity status have shown visible growth.\nTax incentives have been extended to the private sector to achieve the intended\nspread of computers and Internet use in the country. The Government also\nhas specific plans and ongoing projects to upgrade core infrastructure, including\ndigitizing telephone switches, installing fiber optic and radio technologies,\nand expanding national networks to the rural areas. Moves to privatize the\ntelecommunication  sector  are  noteworthy  in  this  regard.  Links  with  a\nsubmarine cable network are also being established to facilitate international\nconnectivity and increase transmission speed. Still, ICT in Bangladesh lags far\nbehind in geographic and population coverage, particularly in the rural areas.\n\nTeledensity\n\nStatistics  show  that  as  of  March  2005,  only  1.007  million  people  in\nBangladesh had access to fixed phones. But, with the rapid growth in mobile\nphones,  telephone  subscribers  (fixed  and  mobile)  numbered  6.42  million.\nTeledensity was therefore only 0.72 for every 100 persons for fixed phones,\nand 4.6 for every 100 persons for fixed and mobile phones in total. Fixed\ntelephones are mostly found in the urban areas. According to a newspaper\nreport in May 2003, out of 895,000 fixed telephones installed by Bangladesh\nTelephone and Telegraph Board, 770,000 lines were in urban areas and 456,000\nlines were in Dhaka alone (The Daily Star, 18 May 2003). Grameen Phone\n(mobile  phones  only)  maintains  a  countrywide  network  that  has  earned  a\nglobal reputation for covering rural people, particularly the women. Mobile\ntelephony has been growing at 35\u201340% a year (Government of Bangladesh\n2003, page 3), and \u201cthe number of connections is projected to increase more\nthan 200% over the next few years\u201d (Ahmed and Mashroor 2004). However,\nmost of the mobile phones now in use can access only other mobile phones.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n357\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f358\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nBTTB has recently reduced its nationwide and international tariff for\nfixed phones and charges a comparatively low tariff for mobile phone calls.\nBut mobile phone operators in the private sector are under criticism for their\nhigh charges.\n\nPC Penetration\n\nPersonal computers (PCs) started gaining popularity among individuals\nand organizations in the early 1990s as prices fell and awareness of computers\nincreased. Sales of PCs climbed rapidly from 1998 because computers and\naccessories were exempted from taxes. Now, 250 computers are sold every\nday, on the average, in Bangladesh (Bangladesh Computer Samity and The\nAsia Foundation 2000, page 4). A study done by the Bangladesh Computer\nCouncil  (BCC)  and  the  Bangladesh  Bureau  of  Statistics  (BBS)  placed  the\ngrowth of PCs between 1999 and 2000 at about 32.88% (Government of\nBangladesh 1999, page 3). The International Telecommunication Union (ITU)\nestimated the number of PCs per 100 population in 2003 at only 0.78 (United\nNations 2003). Ahmed and Mashroor (2003), on the other hand, noted \u201can\nincrease of 35% in PC imports...[such that]...the number of PCs in the country\nstands at 1.5 million.\u201d With this higher figure, the number of PCs per 100\npopulation would therefore be about 1.07. However, the rate of computer\npenetration in Bangladesh is still far below acceptable standards. Most of the\ncomputers are in the urban areas, particularly in Dhaka. The survey by BCC\nand  BBS  showed  that  IT  concentration  was  highest  in  Dhaka  (72.76%),\nfollowed by Chittagong (11.14%), Rajshahi (7.39%), Khulna (4%), Sylhet\n(2.8%),  and  Barisal  (1.3%)  (Government  of  Bangladesh  1999,  page  3),\nindicating a digital divide within the country.\n\nInternet Penetration\n\nIn 1999, there were about 22,000 account holders with 10 Internet Service\nProviders (ISPs) (eight in Dhaka and two in Chittagong) and users numbered\naround 0.1 million. In 2000, there were about 50 ISPs providing Internet services\nto more than 0.35 million users (Bangladesh Country Gateway n.d., page 8).\n\nBTTB has started providing dial-up Internet services in all of the districts\nand about half of the upazilas (subdistricts) and plans to extend the facilities\nto the rest of the upazilas as soon as possible. The number of Internet users\nper 100 population was 0.18 in 2003, according to the ITU estimate (United\nNations 2003).  At present, the number of Internet subscribers stands at nearly\n200,000; if the users of cyber cafes, academic institutions, libraries, etc., are\nadded to this figure, the total number of users could reach nearly one million\nand the number of Internet users per 100 population would be 0.71.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n358\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fE-governance in Bangladesh: A Scrutiny from the Citizens\u2019 Perspective\n\n359\n\nIn the early years of Internet use in Bangladesh, bandwidth was limited\nand expensive because of the high cost of very small aperture terminals (VSATs).\nThe deregulation of VSATs has made increased bandwidth available at lower\nrates. More than 200 licenses have been issued to ISPs; nearly half have yet to\nstart or operate fully, however. ISPs in Bangladesh have been growing at 65%\na  year  (Government  of  Bangladesh  2003,  page  3). These  are  also  mostly\nconcentrated  around  Dhaka  city.  Outside  Dhaka,  there  are  eight  ISPs  in\nChittagong, six in Sylhet, two in Rajshahi, and one each in Khulna, Kustia,\nand Bogra (Abubakar 2002, page 21).\n\nThe cost of Internet access varies from Taka5 15 to Tk30 per hour for\nindividual use, and Tk1,000 to Tk3,000 per month for unlimited use. For\n64\u2013512 kilobytes per second (Kbps) broadband connection, the monthly fee\nvaries from Tk10,000 to Tk90,000. The annual license fee for private VSAT\nis $3,500. At the same time, the average ISP in the country pays Tk290 (or\n$5) per Kbps monthly for international bandwidth, or $5,000 per megabytes\nper second (Mbps) monthly. ISPs in neighboring India pay $2,500 per Mbps\nmonthly, and those in the People\u2019s Republic of China, $1,800 (Government\nof Bangladesh 2003, pages 42\u201343).\n\nAn Evident Digital Divide\n\nSo, a digital divide separates Bangladesh from other countries and the\ngap is unlikely to be closed soon. Within the country, there are further divides\nbetween various groups of people\u2014between rich and poor, male and female,\nadvantaged  and  disadvantaged,  rural  and  urban\u2014and  between  geographic\nregions.  with  respect  to  the  availability,  connectivity,  and  affordability  of\ntechnologies.  Besides,  as  the  Bangladesh  Computer  Samity  and The  Asia\nFoundation (2000, page 5) note: \u201cA dependable information system has not\nyet been developed for the management of large volume data/information\ntransactions in the public/private sectors.\u201d From the perspective of the citizens,\ntherefore, the challenge lies in making technology available at the grassroots\nlevel and in planning and building network infrastructure that is accessible,\navailable, and affordable to everyone.\n\nHuman Development and Awareness Building\n\nThe most vital component of human development is empowering people\nwith  knowledge  and  skills  (Government  of  Bangladesh  2004,  page  119).\nRealizing  the  need  for  the  \u201cwidespread  introduction  of  IT  education  as  a\nprerequisite for producing skilled human capital\u201d (Government of Bangladesh\n\n5\n\n$1 = Taka 60.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n359\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f360\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\n2002), the national ICT policy provides for facilities to be built to promote\nIT  education  and  computer-aided  education  at  all  levels  (Government  of\nBangladesh 2002). The policy also sees the shortage of trained teachers for\nICT education as an impediment to the human resources development plan.\nInitiatives  were  taken  about  13  years  ago  to  introduce  computers  in\nschools and colleges in Bangladesh (Choudhury n.d.). Course curricula for\nthe secondary and higher secondary levels have been developed and these are\ntaught as optional subjects in schools and colleges, at a time when the younger\ngeneration  is  becoming  increasingly  interested  in  ICT  training  to  gain\nadditional  skills.  Under  a  plan  to  distribute  computers  to  educational\ninstitutions, by June 2004, the Ministry of Education had distributed more\nthan 12,000 PCs and provided IT training to 6,000 teachers6 and the BCC\nhad  distributed  725  computers  to  schools  and  arranged  training  for  838\nteachers. Similar efforts have been made by other entities in the public as well\nas the private sector and nongovernment organizations, and private educational\ninstitutions have their own projects in this regard. While the distribution of\ncomputers in schools also creates awareness and makes people familiar with\nnew technologies, however, the optimum or proper use of the computers in\nthese schools, particularly those in rural areas, is not beyond question. Major\nproblems  pertain  to  low  availability  of  power,  poor  location,  the  lack  of\ntrained  teachers,  and  low  motivation  and  awareness.  Nevertheless,  the\nGovernment plans to introduce ICT as a mainstream subject in secondary\nand higher education.\n\nDuring the late 1990s, the number of ICT training institutes increased\nthreefold in 4 years (Sobhan, Khaleque, and Rahman 2002). There are now\nabout 1,500 ICT training institutions in the private sector, with enormous\npotential for extending IT literacy and raising awareness among the general\npublic. But many lack a standard syllabus and technical qualities, leading to\na  mismatch  between  the  ICT  training  courses  and  market  demand. The\nBCC  has  begun  to  evaluate  and  rank  the  private  training  institutes  to\nstandardize their ICT training courses. Some government agencies, such as\nthe Department of Youth, Department of Women Affairs, and BCC, also\nhave  their  own  ICT  training  programs  for  citizens.  Some  of  those\norganizations have facilities for training at the divisional and district level,\nbut not in adequate numbers.\n\n6\n\nInformation collected through personal contact with the Ministry of Education.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n360\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fE-governance in Bangladesh: A Scrutiny from the Citizens\u2019 Perspective\n\n361\n\nCitizens\u2019 Preparedness\n\nCitizens in general do not need more advanced or more extensive ICT\neducation to prepare for e-governance, particularly when it comes to enjoying\npublic services. Preparation relates to bringing public administration closer to\nthe people and making the people aware of and able to enjoy the government\nservices that are offered online. Despite several positive efforts, however, online\nservices are not ready and the citizens are not prepared. They are not aware of\nmany  traditional  public  services  or  their  right  to  such  services.  \u201cThe  vast\nmajority of people in Bangladesh,\u201d the World Bank (1996, page 7) noted,\n\u201care  severely  handicapped  in  their  dealings  with  the  bureaucracy  by  their\nilliteracy and lack of knowledge of their rights as citizens.... In short, ordinary\ntaxpayers in Bangladesh have no sense of a right to services, or, indeed, of\nownership of the government for which they pay.\u201d\n\nThis situation demands sincere efforts on the part of the Government to\nidentify and implement specific public programs, enter into partnerships with\nthe  private  sector,  and  collaborate  with  nongovernment  organizations.\nAttention is needed to make people aware of government services and their\nright to those services, to introduce technology throughout the country, to\nconnect people with the help of ICT, to interest them in government services\nin  innovative  ways.  Publicity  and  literacy  campaigns  generally  help  build\nawareness and empower people. The distribution of computers in educational\ninstitutes, for one, also makes rural people familiar with new technologies\nand aware of their use.\n\nMajor Findings of the Study\n\nThe Government is understandably eager to introduce e-governance in\nthe country. Already, it has taken some visible initiatives. A UN report (2002)\nobserved: \u201c\u2026 there are nations who are finding the resources and the expertise\nto  make  e-government  happen.  Bangladesh,...for  example  recognize[s]  the\nimportance of the role technology plays in development and [has] embarked\non  e-government  programs  representative  of  their  respective  development\nagendas.\u201d However, such efforts are not being adequately marshaled; nor are\nthey supported by an integrated strategy or a \u201cwhole approach.\u201d Besides, current\ne-governance  initiatives  merely  circle  around  the  issue  of  modernizing\ngovernance. The major findings of the study are provided below.\n\nThe national commitment to strengthening the ICT sector is evident in\nmany government policies and activities in Bangladesh, particularly in the use\nof government persuasion in introducing e-governance.\n\nAdministrative reform studies and the Government\u2019s midterm and long-\nterm development plans and strategies acknowledge the need to integrate ICT\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n361\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f362\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\ninto  administration  and  development. Yet,  they  do  not  offer  any  concrete\nsuggestions as to how such integration should be achieved. More efforts are\nneeded to map out specific routes for incorporating ICT particularly in public\nadministration.\n\nA specific management structure for e-governance has yet to be expressly\ndefined by the Government. As a result, strategic directions for e-governance\ncome from different authorities. The directions are concerned mostly with\npreparatory guidelines and less with the needed focus on the citizens.\n\nE-governance  in  Bangladesh  has  started  out  with  no  set  vision  and\nobjectives. Likewise, no national strategic road map for e-governance has been\nprepared so far.\n\nTechnologies, particularly telephone, computer, and Internet, tend to\ncongregate in urban areas, indicating an increasing digital divide within the\ncountry.\n\nThe current e-governance drives of ministries and divisions are focused\nmainly on preparing plans and strategies, achieving connectivity, procuring\ntechnologies, and creating Web sites. Areas that receive less attention include:\nregulation, organizational changes, public services, and awareness building\nfor e governance. As a result, the e-governance initiatives mostly just circle\naround the modernization of government and do not deal directly with the issue.\nThe  culture  and  practice  of  official  e-mail  communications  is  yet  to\nflourish. E-mail communications to and from the general public has yet to\ncatch on.\n\nPublic Web sites are unselective and their contents represent traditional\ngovernance rather than e-governance. The sites do not engage citizens\u2019 interest\nand participation; nor do they serve people through innovative uses of ICT.\nSo far, online services are not ready and the citizens are not prepared;\npeople  are  not  even  aware  of  the  many  traditional  government  services  or\ntheir right to public services.\n\nThe  absence  of  a  computing  platform  in  Bangla  has  been  a  major\n\nconstraint on the popularization enthusiastic use of the technology.\n\nGovernment  has  moved  to  prepare  citizens  through  training.  But\nawareness raising has yet to become a regular part of e-governance initiatives.\nComputers in rural schools also make rural people familiar with new\n\ntechnologies and aware of their use.\n\nThe national commitment to strengthening the ICT sector is evident in\nmany governmental policies and activities in Bangladesh, particularly in the\nuse of government influence to persuade the country to adopt e-governance.\n\nConclusion\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n362\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fE-governance in Bangladesh: A Scrutiny from the Citizens\u2019 Perspective\n\n363\n\nE-governance management structures and strategic directions are emerging.\nThe Government has made specific moves to upgrade core infrastructure and\nfacilitate the spread of ICT.

Consequently, governments the world over have been forced\nto undertake programs and projects for ICT application in their operations,\naiming to inject speed and ease in service provision and thus achieve greater\nproductivity and excellence. Commonly known as e-government, the drive\nhas  become  a  major  feature  of  current  administrative  reforms  globally.\nIncreasingly, it is seen and introduced as a popular strategy for transforming\nthe  delivery  of  public  services,  improving  the  performance  of  public\ninstitutions, and making them more responsive to public needs. So popular is\nits appeal today that it is hard to find a government that has not initiated\nsome  programs  in  ICT  application  and  online  service  provision  (United\nNations  2002,  Saxena  2005).  Despite  differences  in  their  level  of\nimplementation, such initiatives share some common objectives: they all seek\nto provide the citizens with more convenient access to information and services,\nimprove the quality of services offered, and enhance the efficiency, transparency,\nand  accountability  of  the  government  (Commonwealth  Secretariat  2002).\nWhile  advanced  countries  like  Australia,  Canada,  United  Kingdom,  and\nUnited  States  have  already  achieved  remarkable  success  in  their  drive  for\ne-government and improved service delivery, in developing countries, such\nattempts have produced only modest results. This is largely because, in the\nlatter case, e-government initiatives have often been handicapped by a plethora\nof constraints and challenges (UN 2004). This paper examines and analyzes\nMalaysia\u2019s experience with e-government and its impact on service delivery.\nHowever, the paper begins with a brief overview of conceptual issues.\n\n1\n\nSenior Lecturer, Department of Public Policy and Administration, Universiti Brunei Darussalam,\nBrunei Darussalam.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n366\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fInnovations in Governance and Service Delivery: E-government Experiments in Malaysia\n\n367\n\nConceptualizing E-government\n\nGenerally  speaking,  e-government  refers  to  the  use  of  technology  in\ngovernment institutions and operations to enhance access to and delivery of\npublic services. Government agencies are not insulated from the practices of\nthe private sector, nor can they ignore the rising expectations of their clients.\nAs the private sector has taken the lead in ICT adoption and the delivery of\nservices  electronically,  public  organizations  have  found  themselves  under\ngrowing pressure to embrace new technologies to be able to perform better.\nThe  citizens,  having  experienced  the  ease  and  flexibility  of  online  services\ndelivered by private banks and a host of other agencies, have started clamoring\nfor  similar  improvements  in  public  delivery  systems. Their  demands  have\nreceived further strength as a growing number of academics and professionals\nhave made a strong case2 for e-government. Such demands and advocacies\nhave  had  a  profound  impact  on  government  policies  and  decisions. Thus,\ne-government  represents  governmental  response  to  public  demands  and\nexpectations  for  enhanced  and  better  services  by  exploiting  emerging\ntechnologies.  Often  used  interchangeably  with  \u201cdigital  government,\u201d\n\u201cnetworked government,\u201d or \u201cgovernment online,\u201d e-government has been\nsubject to various interpretations and definitions. However, a key element in\nall  these  definitions  is  the  application  of  new  technology\u2014especially  the\nInternet as a tool for enhancing public access to and the delivery of government\nservices. Though e-government has several other manifestations, in its ultimate\nform it entails a process whereby the government agencies at various levels\ntransact their businesses with clients online, strategically addressing client and\ninternal business needs through the application of new ICT tools. As a matter\nof  fact,  most  writers  currently  see  e-government  as  electronically  executed\ntransactions  between  government  agencies  and  citizens.  Therefore,\ne-government is much more than just the application of technology, since it\nseeks to improve both the internal operations and the external interface of\ngovernment by transforming the process in which public services are generated\nand delivered and the entire range of relationships that public bodies have\nwith citizens, businesses, and other governments (Leitner 2003). It is about\nhow organizations in the public sector perceive and apply technology to bring\nabout transformations in service provision, as well as in their relations with\nservice users.\n\n2\n\nE-government has been presented as something that is likely to remedy many of the ills of public\nsector management. It has been argued that e-government will reduce costs and delays in service\ndelivery, widen citizens\u2019  access  to  government  information  and  services,  reinforce  innovations  in\npublic  agencies,  and  increase  transparency  and  accountability,  among  others  (Pardo  2000,  Yong\n2003).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n367\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f368\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nSince  e-government  is  seen  as  a  means  of  promoting  efficiency  in\ngovernment  operations  and  improving  the  delivery  of  public  services,\ne-government typically focuses on the following dimensions seeking to bring\nabout major changes in the quality of services, the nature of interactions, and\ngovernmental relations with relevant stakeholders (Yong 2003).\n\n(cid:127) Government to Citizens (G2C)\u2013to facilitate citizens\u2019 interaction with\nthe government through the development of user-friendly \u201cone-stop\u201d\ncenters offering high-quality services.\n\n(cid:127) Government  to  Business  (G2B)\u2013to  expedite  business  transactions\nbetween  government  and  private  agencies  through  improved\ncommunication and connectivity.\n\n(cid:127) Government  to  Government  (G2G)\u2013to  share  data  and  conduct\nelectronic transactions between governmental actors. This includes\nboth  intra-  and  interagency  interactions  between  employees,\ndepartments, and ministries, and even between governments.\n\nE-government programs initiated thus far in most societies are essentially\ngeared toward effecting change in one or more of these dimensions. Clearly,\nthese dimensions demand an effective and efficient networking of government\nagencies, citizens, and businesses so as to evolve a collaborative environment.\nIt is only through this connectivity and collaboration between various parties\nand agencies that the goal of offering efficient, high-quality services to the\ncitizens and businesses can be achieved.\n\nAlthough  e-government  is  quite  popular  and  promising,  it  is  neither\nmagical nor an automatically occurring phenomenon. It calls for a multitude\nof changes in organizational structures, business processes, tools and strategies\nused, and the relationship between the government and the governed. Hence,\nthe  transition  from  government  to  e-government  is  far  from  easy  and\nstraightforward;  it  is  an  evolutionary  process,  usually  characterized  by  five\nmajor stages of development. The first stage, the country\u2019s commitment to\nbecome an e-government player, is reflected in the presence of government on\nthe Internet. Commonly known as the emerging presence stage, this first stage\nis characterized by the existence of government Web sites providing the citizens\nwith some information that is basic and limited. Most information available\non the Web remains static, with few options for the citizens. In stage 2, known\nas the enhanced presence stage, a greater amount of information on public policy\nand governance (e.g., policies, laws, regulations, reports, newsletters) is provided\nwith  downloadable  databases. Though  more  sophisticated,  interaction  is\nprimarily unidirectional, with information flowing from the government to\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n368\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fInnovations in Governance and Service Delivery: E-government Experiments in Malaysia\n\n369\n\nthe citizens. In the interactive stage (stage 3), the citizens are able to interact\nwith the government through the Internet, and a wide variety of services are\navailable  online.  Hence,  the  people  are  also  able  to  search  for  specialized\ndatabases,  download  forms,  and  apply  for  services  like  tax  payment  and\napplication for license renewal online. To give the people current and up-to-\ndate information, Web sites are regularly updated. In the transactional stage\n(stage 4), complete, secure, and two-way transactions between the citizens\nand government is possible for a range of online services like obtaining visas,\npassports, licenses, and permit renewals; paying taxes; and performing other\nG2C interactions. Providers of goods and services are able to bid online for\npublic contracts through secure links. Stage 5 represents the most sophisticated\nlevel, characterized by an integration of services delivered and the institutions\noffering them. Known as the integration stage, it seeks to remove the physical\nbarriers  and  offer  most,  if  not  all,  public  services  seamlessly.  Also,  here  the\ngovernment encourages participatory decision making to involve the society in\ntwo-way open dialogues, and uses interactive features to solicit citizens\u2019 views\non public policy, lawmaking, and a variety of issues (Yong 2003, UN 2004).\n\nE-government in Malaysia: Innovations in Governance and Service\nDelivery\n\nIn line with the global trend, Malaysia has also embarked on elaborate\nprograms  seeking  to  improve  the  state  of  governance  and  service  delivery\nsystems through the application of emerging technologies. One of the early\ninitiatives in this regard was the introduction of a public service network (PSN)\nin the early 1990s. As a step toward ICT application in government3 and the\nnetworking and integration of service delivery, this program has enabled post\noffices throughout the country to act as one-stop bill payment centers and\nprovide other services. Services like the renewal of various licenses, stamping,\nand payment of road tax for motor vehicles were made available at the same\ncounter  of  post  offices  throughout  the  country.  Subsequently,  additional\nservices like the payment of local government assessment rates, sewerage charge,\nand a number of private sector services have been added for the convenience\nof the public. The experience with the PSN model has encouraged privatized\nutility agencies like Telekom Malaysia and Tenaga Nasional Bhd to follow\nsimilar  models.  While  the  PSN  initiatives  have  prepared  the  ground  for  a\nmore integrated service delivery through information sharing and networking,\nthe establishment of the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC)4  in 1996 is seen\n\n3\n\nIt is, in fact, a part of the Government\u2019s larger policy objective, which seeks to develop Malaysia as a\nregional and global hub for ICT and multimedia.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n369\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f370\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nas a major landmark in Malaysia\u2019s drive for e-government and improved service\ndelivery. The MSC is conceived as a principal vehicle for achieving a knowledge-\nbased society through a fusion of ideas in management, research in technology,\nand dissemination of information and multimedia-based products and services.\nThough computerization in both private and public sectors began much earlier,\nit  was  the  MSC  that  essentially  set  off  the  process  of  a  more  robust\nimplementation of e-government initiatives. To achieve the objectives of MSC,\na total of seven flagship applications have been identified for implementation.5\nE-government is one of the leading flagship applications of the MSC\nproject.  It  is  aimed  at  reinventing  how  the  government  works,  as  well  as\nimproving the quality of its interactions with citizens and businesses through\nimproved  connectivity  and  better  access  to  information  and  services.  It\nenvisions not only an efficient system of administration and service delivery\nbut also a collaborative environment where the government, businesses, and\ncitizens will work together for the benefit of the country as a whole (Karim\nand Khairuddin 1999). Such a vision calls for reinventing government through\nthe application of ICT and multimedia and making the governmental agencies\nmore efficient, effective, and consequently more responsive to the needs of\nthe citizens. Thus the ultimate objective of e-Government is to achieve public\nservice  excellence  by  reducing  paperwork  and  streamlining  public  service\nprocesses so as to enable the citizens to access public services anytime and\nfrom  anywhere.  It  is  to  lead  to  dramatic  improvements  in  service  delivery\nsystems,  for  the  outcomes  e-government  is  expected  to  achieve  include\nconvenience, speed, choice, accessibility, and responsiveness (Khalid 2004).\nWhile  five  pilot  projects  were  initially  selected  for  the  first  phase  of\nimplementation, subsequently more projects were added to cover all three\ndimensions of e-government, namely, intra-agency and interagency, G2C, and\nG2B service applications. Thus, currently a total of eight projects involving\ne-government flagship applications are at various stages of implementation or\n\n4 The MSC is a 750-square kilometer area extending from the Kuala Lumpur city center project in the\nnorth to Putrajaya in the south and to Kuala Lumpur International airport in Sepang. Within this\ncorridor are two smart cities\u2014Putrajaya, the new seat of the federal Government, and Cyberjaya,\nthe site for ICT companies investing in the country. Apart from providing the best ICT infrastructure\nand  a  high-quality  multimedia  test  bed,  the  MSC  also  offers  access  to  and  opportunities  for\nsophisticated research and development, a set of cyber laws, and the benefits of a modern and futuristic\nlifestyle with new highways, high-quality houses, schools, shopping malls, and business and recreation\ncenters.\n\n5 These are e-Government, Telehealth, Government Multipurpose Card (smart card), Smart School,\nR&D Cluster, World Wide Web Manufacturing, and Borderless Marketing. The implementation of\nthese flagship projects is expected to improve the country\u2019s productivity and competitiveness through\nthe use of multimedia technology.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n370\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fInnovations in Governance and Service Delivery: E-government Experiments in Malaysia\n\n371\n\nrollout. These are Electronic Services (e-Services), e-Procurement (eP), General\nOffice  Environment  (GOE),  Human  Resource  Management  Information\nSystem  (HRMIS),  Project  Monitoring  System  (PMS),  Electronic  Labor\nExchange (ELX), EG-AG Integration,6 and e-Syariah. Here we focus on a few\nof these applications and some MSC flagship projects that have a significant\nbearing on service delivery.\n\ne-Services\n\nThe e-Services scheme was among the five pilot projects chosen by the\nGovernment for the first phase of the implementation. The primary objective\nof this project is to enhance service access through multiple electronic delivery\nchannels that are widely accessible to the public and one-stop service windows\nwhere multiple services can be obtained at each delivery channel. Under the\nscheme, the citizens are able to conveniently access the services offered by a\nvariety of departments and agencies7\u2014the issuance and renewal of driving\nlicenses, payment for summons, payment of electricity, telephone, and Internet\nbills  (Karim and Khalid 2003). Also, there are provisions for multiple electronic\nchannels, as services are also available through the Internet, multimedia kiosks,\ninteractive voice response (IVR), telephone, and wireless devices, with facilities\nfor payment with credit cards, debit and ATM cards, and other modes of\npayment. Thus, the citizens are provided with a choice of multiple delivery\nchannels 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. In other words, they are no longer\nrequired to conduct transactions at agency branches and utility offices; they\ncan do so anywhere, at their convenience. To make the services more user-\nfriendly, multiple language capabilities for each access device have also been\nintroduced. The  implementation  of  the  project  has  resulted  in  significant\nimprovements  in  public  service  delivery,  apart  from  ease  and  public\nconvenience. It has encouraged users to be more responsive in paying their\nbills (Karim 2003, page 196).\n\n6 This is intended to integrate the various elements of the e-Government with the Accountant-General\n(AG)\u2019s  Department.  Such  an  integration  is  considered  necessary  as  an  end-to-end  solution  for\nelectronic payment processes and procedures under e-government projects.\n\n7 The  agencies  involved  in  this  case  are  the  Road Transport  Department,  the  Ministry  of  Health,\n\nTenaga Nasional Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd, and the Police Department.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n371\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f372\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\ne-Perolehan (e-Procurement)\n\nSince the Government of Malaysia is a major purchaser of goods and\nservices from the private sector, spending a total of RM35 billion annually,\nthe e-Procurement project has been launched with the objective of ensuring\nvalue  for  money,  as  well  as  transparency  and  accountability  in  public\nprocurement. The project seeks to reengineer and automate the existing manual\nprocurement  system  in  the  public  sector  to  transform  it  into  an  online\nmarketplace for suppliers and government agencies. Under the project, begun\nin 1999 and implemented in phases, the Government and suppliers are allowed\nto conduct procurement activities electronically. Suppliers may present their\nproducts on the Internet; receive, manage, and process purchase orders online;\nand eventually receive the payment from government agencies, also through\nthe  Internet.  Government  agencies  may  approve  and  submit  the  purchase\norders, and also select items to be purchased and initiate the approval process\u2014\nall  electronically.  Thus,  the  e-Procurement  system  supports  the  entire\nprocurement cycle, from the submission of tender or contract to approval and\npayment,  including  alert  notifications  to  the  potential  bidders.  For  the\nGovernment,  the  system  will  lead  to  cost  savings  through  a  shortened\nprocurement cycle (made possible by the electronic retrieval and submission\nof quotations) and the creation of centralized products and supply databases\nacross agencies. It will also enable the Government to be a smart buyer, as well\nas  improve  control  and  accuracy  in  ordering  and  billing. The  suppliers\u2014\nsmall or large\u2014will also benefit from increased transparency and faster and\naccurate payment through electronic fund transfers (Karim and Khalid 2003).\nWith the creation of an electronic catalogue with internationally recognized\nproduct classifications, suppliers will also be able to reach new customers on a\nglobal scale.\n\nElectronic Labor Exchange\n\nThe Electronic Labor Exchange (ELX) was launched in 1999 as a new\ne-government  pilot  project  that  is  aimed  at  serving  as  the  country\u2019s  single\nsource of labor market information for government agencies, businesses, and\nthe public. The three applications of ELX\u2014Job Clearing System, Labor Market\nDatabase,  and  Office  Productivity  System\u2014permit  the  registration  of  job\nseekers  and  employers,  job  matching  and  the  generation  of  profiles  of\ncandidates for prospective employment, the consolidation of labor market\ndata from various sources, and a variety of other functions. Thus, the ELX\nserves as a one-stop center for labor market information, facilitating the sharing\nof  such  information  by  various  parties,  both  locally  and  overseas.  Such\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n372\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fInnovations in Governance and Service Delivery: E-government Experiments in Malaysia\n\n373\n\navailability of information enables Malaysian students studying overseas to\nmake informed decisions about their career, and potential foreign investors,\nabout  their  investment.  It  also  helps  improve  the  mobilization  of  human\nresources and optimize manpower utilization through systematic matching of\njob seekers and job vacancies (Karim 2003).\n\nGovernment Multipurpose Card (MyKad)\n\nThe Government Multipurpose Card, commonly known as MyKad, is\none of the major innovations promoted by MSC. With the introduction in\n2002 of MyKad (which is to replace the old identity card), Malaysia has become\nthe first country in the world to have a multipurpose smart card that facilitates\ntransactions with government agencies and private organizations. The single\nsmart card contains the owner\u2019s identity code and electronic signature in a\nplastic card with an embedded microprocessor chip. The national identification\ndocument and driving license are combined into one card that serves as a key\nto  managing  access  to  many  other  services.  Instant  passport  information\nfacilitates  the  efficient  exit  and  reentry  of  Malaysians  at  immigration\ncheckpoints. Health information available on MyKad is found to be extremely\nuseful as instant source of personal health data during emergencies and general\ntreatment. E-cash facilities enable cashless financial transactions at government\nagencies,  restaurants,  clinics,  bookshops,  and  gasoline  stations  throughout\nthe country. With additional facilities now being added, MyKad is expected\nto serve as a vehicle of convenience in all aspects of the lives of Malaysians\n(Karim 2003).\n\nTelehealth\n\nOne of the major flagship projects of MSC, the Telehealth project is\naimed at promoting Malaysia as a leading regional center for telemedicine. It\nalso  seeks  to  widen  public  access  to  health-care  facilities,  as  well  as  their\nknowledge of health care. A key element of the project is linking rural clinics\nwith medical experts in the city and renowned clinics worldwide using new\ntele-instruments for remote diagnosis (Karim and Khalid 2003). Thus, the\nproject is essentially geared toward developing an efficient and user-oriented\nhealth-care system. Both public and private health-care agencies will be involved\nand connectivity will be ensured via Internet access and call centers. Thus,\nonce completed, the project is expected to transform the country\u2019s health-care\nsystem to ensure integrated, accessible, and high-quality health-care services\nto the citizens. Four pilot projects are now being implemented in areas ranging\nfrom  the  provision  of  health  information  and  education  to  the  public,  to\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n373\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f374\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nlong-distance health-care consultation and referrals. It is expected that the\nfull implementation of this project will allow individuals to manage their own\nhealth and eventually lead to an integrated and user-oriented health-care system.\nSince e-government is high on the agenda of the Government, it has\nreceived strong financial, institutional, and legal support. The massive revised\nallocation made for the development of ICT and e-government projects to\nthe tune of RM7.7 billion under the Eighth Malaysia Plan (EPU 2003) clearly\nreflects the Government\u2019s commitment to develop this sector. The Government\nhas also developed the necessary institutional framework and coordination\nmechanisms for e-initiatives. At the highest level is the powerful e-Government\nSteering  Committee  (EGSC),8  responsible  for  providing  policy  directions,\napproving  e-government  programs  and  activities,  and  monitoring  their\nimplementation.  The  Malaysian  Administrative  Modernization  and\nManagement Planning Unit (MAMPU) serves as the secretariat of the EGSC,\nbesides acting as the central agency in planning and devising e-government\ninitiatives. Also, there are IT councils at national and state levels. The National\nIT Council (NITC) represents the highest forum that acts as a think tank\nadvising the Government on relevant strategies. At the agency level, the post\nof chief information officer (CIO) has been created, with the task of overseeing\nthe implementation of the ICT agenda in the various agencies. The CIO is\nalso to determine the strategies for achieving the vision and business needs of\nthe organization, provide leadership and direction, coordinate and allocate\nresources, and keep abreast of new knowledge and continuous change in the\nfield of ICT (MAMPU 2000).\n\nMalaysia  has  taken  a  holistic  approach  to  the  implementation  of\ne-government, encompassing elements such as applications, networks, security,\nprocess engineering, operations and support, change management, and skills\nand knowledge (see Karim and Khalid 2003). Four guiding principles have\nbeen identified, namely, collaboration between the public and private sectors,\nsharing  of  data  and  information,  customer  satisfaction,  and  data  and\ninformation security (UNESCO 2002). To keep pace with developments in\nICT infrastructure and use, the Government has also introduced legislation\nto curb abuse in the new digital environment. The laws cover such issues as\n\n8 Chaired  by  the  chief  secretary  to  the  government,  the  committee  draws  its  members  from  the\nEconomic Planning Unit; the Implementation and Coordination Unit; the National Institute of\nPublic  Administration  (INTAN);  the  Treasury;  the  Ministry  of  Energy,  Communication  and\nMultimedia;  the  Malaysian  Administrative  Modernization  and  Management  Planning  Unit\n(MAMPU); the Office of the Attorney General; the Public Service Department; and the Multimedia\nDevelopment Corporation.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n374\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fInnovations in Governance and Service Delivery: E-government Experiments in Malaysia\n\n375\n\ninformation security, integrity and confidentiality, legal recognition of online\ntransactions, and the protection of intellectual property rights.9\n\nSince the development of adequate infrastructure is critical in realizing\nthe full benefits of the ICT revolution and the vision of e-Government, the\nMalaysian Government has made continuous efforts to develop and strengthen\nthe  necessary  infrastructure  in  the  country. The  Government  Integrated\nTelecommunications Network (GITN) is a major step toward this end. The\nCivil  Service  Link  (CSL),  established  in  1994  as  a  tool  to  disseminate\ngovernment information to the public, has since been upgraded and renamed\nthe Malaysian Civil Service Link (MCSL). Further improvements are now\nunder way to replace it with the Malaysian Government Portal, or myGOV,\nwhich will serve as a single gateway for gaining access to all government services\nand  making  online  payments.  Continuous  efforts  are  being  made  by  the\nGovernment to encourage agencies to create and use their Web sites as a means\nof diversifying public service delivery mechanisms. At present, virtually every\nagency in the public sector maintains its own Web site displaying some key\ninformation. Evidence shows that not only have there been improvements in\nthe quality of Web sites and the types of information available, but an increasing\nnumber of people have also visited these Web sites (Nair 2002).\n\nThe pervasive nature of ICT and the demand for skills and knowledge\nin the emerging technology have posed a serious challenge to governments\nworldwide. The Smart School flagship project of MSC is intended to address\nthe  critical  challenge  of  manpower  needs.  Equipped  with  multimedia\ntechnology, the smart schools are to prepare students for the ICT era and\ndevelop a new generation of graduates who are creative, innovative, and capable\nof using ICT to leverage the wealth of information and knowledge in the\ninformation age. With the same aims and objectives in mind, a new Multimedia\nUniversity has also been established. The Government is investing heavily in\na high-quality and comprehensive education system to meet the demands of\nthe evolving workplace. Training institutions like the National Institute of\nPublic Administration (INTAN) have made sustained efforts to equip public\nservants with the relevant knowledge, skills, and attitudes. As an organization\nresponsible for creating a critical mass of ICT users to support e-government\ninitiatives, INTAN has undertaken various other programs. The Government\nis also aware of the widening gap between IT haves and have-nots within the\ncommunity, and between the urban and rural areas, and the potential dangers\n\n9\n\nSome of the laws are the Digital Signature Act of 1997, the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 1997,\nthe Communications and Multimedia Act of 1998, the Telemedicine Act of 1997, and the Computer\nCrimes Act of 1997.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n375\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f376\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nit poses. Therefore, programs like Medan Infodesa, Internet Desa, and Pondok\nHarmoni and the establishment of e-Services kiosks at community and public\nareas have been launched to bridge the digital divide. While Medan Infodesa\nprovides  training  and  hardware  to  rural  communities,  Internet  Desa  and\nPondok  Harmoni  entail  the  supply  of  PCs  and  Internet  access  to  rural\ncommunities.10\n\ne-Government and Service Delivery: Achievements\nand Limitations\n\nMalaysia has made concerted and sustained efforts to ensure the successful\nimplementation of e-Government. Apart from the implementation of various\ne-Government  flagship  projects,  Malaysia  has  developed  and  put  in  place\ninstitutional frameworks and coordination mechanisms, all of these supported\nby the necessary guidelines and ICT policies and legislation. The Government\nhas also embarked on various novel initiatives to reinvent itself and its service\ndelivery, empower state and local authorities to implement ICT applications,\nand set up special committees to oversee the implementation of e-Government\ninitiatives. It has also adopted various strategies and schemes to enhance ICT\nliteracy and skills in the society, in an attempt to support the application and\ndiffusion of  ICT. The Smart School initiative under the MSC project responds\nto the need for manpower and skills to make the transition from an industrial\nto a knowledge-based economy. Since much of the e-initiatives are still either\nin the process of pilot testing or at the initial stage of rollout, it is too premature\nto  make  any  definitive  judgment  about  their  impact.  However,  initial\nindications suggest that they have quite a favorable impact on governance and\nservice delivery.\n\nIn line with the objective of providing efficient and high-quality services\nto the public electronically, various government ministries and agencies have,\nas noted earlier, introduced Web sites. Virtually every agency in Malaysia has\na  Web  site,  which  displays  its  vision,  mission,  objectives,  charter,  services\navailable, and a host of other useful information for its clients. As more and\nmore information is being posted, the citizens also increasingly find the Web\nsites to be useful sources of relevant information. Since such Web sites often\nallow the public to express their views and opinions about the quality of services\nprovided and lodge their complaints and grievances, these sites also serve as\neffective tools for public consultation and engagement (Khalid 2004). Some\nagencies  have  gone  beyond  this  stage  by  offering  online  services,  thereby\n\n10\n\nIn 2001\u20132003, a total of 16 Internet Desa and 15 InfoDesa were established nationwide. These now\nfunction as one-stop centers of information and government services (EPU 2003).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n376\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fInnovations in Governance and Service Delivery: E-government Experiments in Malaysia\n\n377\n\nallowing the public to use their facilities and services in a far more convenient\nmanner than before. The e-portal of the Ministry of International Trade and\nIndustry (MITI) is a case in point. It has not only enhanced the sharing of\ntrade-related information and resources, but has also expedited the approval\nof licenses and permits. The potential entrepreneurs can now obtain useful\ninformation and guidelines on how to start a business and get it registered,\nall  online  (EPU  2003).  Similarly,  the  introduction  of  self-assessment  and\ne-calculation systems by the Inland Revenue Board allows taxpayers to access\nonline information, perform self-assessment, and submit their tax returns in a\nmore convenient way. Such initiatives are said to have helped modernize and\nstreamline tax administration and contributed to an increased level of income\ntax compliance (Aziz 2003).\n\nThus, e-Government initiatives have led to a new mode of governance\nwhereby the conventional method of offering services at office counters is\nbeing increasingly replaced by new methods. The provisions for online services\nhave been particularly convenient, as the citizens are not required to make\ntransactions over the service counter of an agency; they can now make such\ntransactions online using the Internet, multimedia kiosks, and other channels.\nThe  integration  of  services  offered  by  multiple  agencies  means  that  the\ncustomers are no longer required to visit each agency to access their services; a\nsingle agency is able to provide all these services in a more convenient and\nhassle-free manner. Therefore, the public now gets better services, which are\noften streamlined and integrated with other services offered by government\nand private agencies. As elaborated earlier, under the e-Services system, the\nclients of several public and private agencies can access multiple services at\none point. Moreover, the availability of services 24 hours a day and 7 days a\nweek means that services are available without any loss of time. In some cases,\nlong queues at service counters have now become a thing of the past. Even\nthose members of the public who are not electronically connected at home\nmay conduct business with government agencies at community-based centers\nor kiosks. While the customers and businesses enjoy the convenience and ease\nof accessing multiple services at one point, such networking of services has\nalso relieved the departments and agencies of excessive workload. They can\nnow  focus  on  control  and  data  integrity  while  leaving  the  onerous  job  of\ndirect delivery of services to a network of providers.\n\nSimilarly, the Telehealth project marks a new chapter in the country\u2019s\nhealth-care system, especially in rural and remote areas. Now available in 41\nclinics,  the  program  offers  remote  diagnosis  and  consultation  as  well  as\ncontinuous medical training through the use of virtual resources (EPU 2003).\nPatients from these areas are no longer required to make expensive and often\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n377\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f378\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\ntroublesome trips to major urban centers and even overseas to seek consultation\nand medication from specialist physicians; such facilities are now available\nlocally  for  their  benefit.  Likewise,  the  National  Registration  Department\u2019s\nMyKad, already issued to more than 15 million Malaysians (New Straits Times,\n25  April  2005),  has  become  truly  a  vehicle  of  convenience  in  a  variety  of\nareas. While information like personal identification, driving license, and health\nand passport details facilitate a number of functions related to government,\nwith  cash,  \u201ctouch-n-go,\u201d  and  ATM  facilities  cardholders  can  also  make\ntransactions with private agencies.\n\ne-Government  initiatives  are  contributing  significantly  as  well  to\nenhancing the efficiency of public agencies in service delivery, and the benefits\nare enjoyed by citizens, businesses, and the government alike. e-Procurement\nby government ministries is not only reducing the government\u2019s procurement\ncosts but also making the operations faster and steadier, contributing to the\nsatisfaction  of  all  parties.  For  private  contractors,  the  introduction  of\ne-Procurement has meant a significant increase in overall efficiency, since the\nsystem has reduced the time between application for registration and approval\nof supplies from 36 days to 20 days. The number of lost supplier registration\ndocuments has fallen from 5% to 1% (Karim 2003). Similar improvements\nhave been reported elsewhere. It now takes the Immigration Department just\n2  days  to  issue  an  international  passport;  before  the  introduction  of\ne-Government, the same task used to take 8 weeks (Aziz 2003). e-Government\nhas  also  considerably  improved  the  efficiency  of  port  authorities  and  the\nCustoms Department. The electronic data interchange (EDI) enables port\nauthorities across the country to process applications for import and export\nin a nearly paperless environment.\n\nDespite  such  gains  in  service  delivery  and  governmental  efficiency,\nhowever, the overall impact of e-Government in Malaysia has remained limited.\ne-Government has promised a lot, but for most of the population, the promise\nhas not been realized because of some serious constraints and limitations.\n\nWhile the potentials of ICT in general and e-Government in particular\nare enormous for both government and the citizens, the unlocking of such\npotentials  requires  sufficient  ICT  infrastructure,  including  computers  and\ntelecommunications capacity in terms of wireless and broadband networks,\namong  others. Therefore,  the  lack  of  such  infrastructure,  or  inadequate\ninfrastructure  and  capacity,  will  seriously  hamper  the  delivery  of  services\nthrough the Internet. Although Malaysia fares well in ICT infrastructure, its\nfacilities, when compared with those of the rest of the region (Karim 2003)\nand other developing countries in general, are still poor overall. This is clear\nwhen Malaysia\u2019s position is compared with that of the regional leaders. As\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n378\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fInnovations in Governance and Service Delivery: E-government Experiments in Malaysia\n\n379\n\nTable 1 shows, in terms of most vital infrastructure like ownership of personal\ncomputers (PCs), access to the Internet, and telephone connections, Malaysia\nlags  far  behind  Republic  of  Korea,  Australia,  and  neighboring  Singapore.\nConsequently,  Malaysia\u2019s  score  on  the  Global  e-Readiness  Index  and  its\ne-Readiness rank have been notably poor, although it has made significant\nprogress over the years.\n\nTable 1: E-government Readiness of Malaysia and Selected Countries in\nAsia Pacific Region\n\nE-Gov\u2019t\nReadi-\nness\nIndex\n\n0.8575\n0.8377\n0.8340\n0.5409\n\nE-\n\nInternet\nReadi- Users\n(per\nness\n \u2019000)\nRank\n\n5\n6\n8\n42\n\n551.9\n481.7\n504.4\n319.7\n\nPCs\n(per\n\u2019000)\n\n558.8\n565.1\n622.0\n146.8\n\nCountry\n\nRep. of Korea\nAustralia\nSingapore\nMalaysia\n\nSource: United Nations (2004).\n\nPopulation\n Online\nper\n\u2019000)\n\nTele-\nphones\nper\n\u2019000)\n\nMobile\nPhone\n Sub-\n\nTV\nSets\n(per\nscribers  \u2019000)\nper\u2019000)\n\n538.0\n543.8\n518.4\n251.5\n\n488.6\n538.6\n462.9\n190.4\n\n679.9\n639.9\n795.6\n376.8\n\n363\n731\n300\n201\n\nDespite governmental initiatives and strong emphasis put on multimedia,\nbroadband use has remained relatively low (Yong 2003). In fact, apart from\nthe corporate sector and government departments and agencies, only a few\nhouseholds in Malaysia have broadband connections. This explains why the\nInternet penetration rate has been slow and the proportion of the population\nreceiving benefits from e-Government initiatives has not been high. There are\nalso regional variations and variations across socioeconomic groups. Because\nof inadequate ICT infrastructure, the Internet facility is not easily and widely\naccessible to all. While services are generally accessible in Klang Valley and in\nmajor urban centers, those from other areas and especially in geographically\nisolated regions do not have access to many of the online services. Moreover,\nthe poorer groups and people with economic and social disabilities have neither\nthe capacity nor the ability to use online technologies. Programs like InfoDesa\nand  Internet  Desa  are  yet  to  bring  a  significant  proportion  of  the  rural\npopulation under their coverage. In some areas, problems with electrical power\nmake the job even more difficult (Yong 2003).\n\nA study on the adoption of ICT in the public sector and its impact on\nservice delivery in Malaysia has observed that in most cases ICT has been\ndeployed in internal processes, or what is known as backroom operations.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n379\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f380\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nThese activities remain invisible to the public although they directly affect the\nservices provided to them. The study further noted that the delivery of services\nthrough special kiosks is highly limited and so is the delivery of services via\nthe  Internet  (Abdullah  and  Ahmad  2001).  Although  things  have  certainly\nimproved since then, evidence shows that the progress has been rather slow\nespecially with regard to the online delivery of services. Still, many agencies\nuse ICT more to facilitate their internal operations than to augment online\ndelivery and transactions. Consequently, a large majority of services continue\nto be offered through traditional methods. Even in information access and\ndissemination between government and the citizens, Malaysia is still considered\ninadequate (Karim 2003). This is also evident in Malaysia\u2019s overall level of\ne-government  maturity.  As  the  following  table  shows,  compared  with  the\ne-maturity  of  world  and  regional  leaders  in  e-government,  Malaysia\u2019s\ne-maturity  has  been  particularly  low.  While  it  comes  as  no  surprise  that\ncountries  like  Australia,  Singapore,  and  Republic  of  Korea  have  higher  e\nmaturity scores than Malaysia, it is noteworthy that even India (53.6) and\nThailand (50.4) are ahead of Malaysia (46.4). A close look at the table also\nshows that Malaysia has been bogged down between stage 2 and stage 3. This\nbasically  suggests  that  while  government  Web  sites  provide  some  useful\ninformation  and  some  online  services,  the  scope  for  transactions  between\ncitizens  and  government  and  for  service  delivery  in  a  seamless  fashion  is\nextremely limited. Therefore, more robust policy initiatives are called for, to\ntackle that challenge and improve public access to services significantly.\n\nTable 2: E-government Maturity Index\n\nCountry\n\nTotal\n\nStage 1\n\nStage 2\n\nStage 3\n\nStage 4\n\nStage 5\n\nUSA\nUK\nSingapore\nRep. of Korea\nAustralia\nIndia\nThailand\nMalaysia\n\n94.5\n92.0\n91.6\n89.4\n78.5\n53.6\n50.4\n46.4\n\n Source: United Nations (2004).\n\n100.0\n100.0\n100.0\n100.0\n100.0\n100.0\n87.5\n100.0\n\n100.0\n97.7\n95.4\n100.0\n93.1\n73.6\n79.3\n67.8\n\n100.0\n94.0\n98.8\n100.0\n91.7\n70.2\n50.0\n53.6\n\n92.7\n92.7\n85.4\n70.7\n61.0\n17.1\n0.0\n17.1\n\n77.8\n77.8\n77.8\n68.5\n44.4\n16.7\n37.0\n14.8\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n380\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fInnovations in Governance and Service Delivery: E-government Experiments in Malaysia\n\n381\n\nDespite all the improvements and continuous efforts that are being made,\nit is not uncommon to find Web links that are either nonfunctional or under\nconstruction or have not been updated for a long time. In some cases, no\nmultilingual options are available, despite professed policy in this regard. The\nRoad Transport Department\u2019s Web site available only in Bahasa Melayu, is\nnot user-friendly especially for those not adept in local language. The Inland\nRevenue  Board\u2019s  e-Payment  is  yet  to  be  functional;  the  Immigration\nDepartment  provides  only  downloadable  forms  with  no  provision  for\ne-lodgment of new passports or the renewal of existing ones. Likewise, the\nbenefits of e-Procurement cannot be fully enjoyed by either the government\nagencies or the suppliers since a very small fraction of total government contacts\nare managed online. Only 1,000 out of the total 4,288 government agencies\nnow  use  e-Procurement.  Likewise,  out  of  more  than  35,000  suppliers\nnationwide, only 500 have been IT-enabled, i.e., equipped with smart cards\nthat allow them to do transactions electronically (Yong 2005). One may find\na  host  of  other  anomalies  and  limitations  in  the  present  e-Government\nprograms.\n\nConclusion\n\nMalaysia is among the leading countries in the developing world in the\nimplementation of huge e-government programs. The unwavering support\nfrom  the  leadership  of  the  country  and  generous  allocations  for  the\ndevelopment of the ICT sector in general and e-government in particular has\nhelped build necessary e-government infrastructure and facilities. The various\ne-government and MSC projects that are currently being tested and rolled\nout have shown enormous promise in different spheres. The provision for\nonline  services  has  made  a  fundamental  difference  in  public  access  to\ngovernment information and facilities. The distance between the government\nand the citizens has been reduced and the public is able to obtain services\nconveniently  without  any  loss  of  time. Thus,  the  programs  signal  a  new\nrelationship  between  government  and  the  citizens.  The  old  relationship\ncharacterized  by  rigidity,  long  delays,  unnecessary  complexity,  and  public\ndistress  is  being  replaced  by  a  new  relationship,  which  is  characterized  by\nspeed, better public access, reduced cost, and public ease and convenience.\nThe e-initiatives have helped the agencies become not only more efficient and\neffective in their operations but also more responsive to the needs of their\nclients. The Web sites maintained by most public agencies not only provide\ninformation  about  their  activities  and  programs,  many  of  them  also  offer\nfeedback options, thereby allowing the public to express their views, needs,\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n381\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f382\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nand problems. Though it is difficult to ascertain the impact of such feedback\non government policies and decisions, the mere presence of such provisions\nindicates an increasing public orientation on the part of the agencies.\n\nHowever, as this paper shows, despite such promise and positive trends,\nthe overall impact of e-government in Malaysia has remained limited because\nof a plethora of infrastructure constraints and the slow pace of implementation.\nAt present, Malaysia is behind many other developing countries in e-readiness\nand  e-maturity  levels.  Broadening  public  access  to  ICT  significantly  and\nbridging the digital divide in the society represents a major challenge for the\nMalaysian leadership. Recent policy measures initiated by the Government\nallowing Employees Provident Fund (EPF) contributors to withdraw a portion\nof their savings to purchase computers, and civil servants to get interest-free\ncomputer loans are steps in the right direction. Likewise, the initiatives to\nenhance  community  access  to  the  Internet  in  both  urban  and  rural  areas\nthrough publicly provided facilities are bold attempts to level the access gap.\nHowever, much more needs to be done to widen public access to e-government\nand Internet facilities in other remote areas. While infrastructure is critical,\npeople also need awareness, skills, and motivation to use such facilities. Training\nin e-technology is necessary for senior citizens in both rural and urban areas\nso that they can make use of e-kiosks and other new channels.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n382\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fInnovations in Governance and Service Delivery: E-government Experiments in Malaysia\n\n383\n\nReferences\n\nAbdullah, H., S., and A.

In  addition,  governance\u2014or\ngood governance, according to the terminology of international institutions\u2014\nis more often decried because of the Western values it carries (Charvin and\nCassen 2001, page 28), being imposed on countries that do not share the\nsame  referents.  However,  the  transformation  wrought  in  the  international\ncommunity by economic globalization requires in-depth changes in states\u2019\nmodes of action. In that capacity, governance highlights contradictions in this\ntransformation  movement,  and  entails  a  global  review  of  public  affairs\nmanagement.\n\nFrom  a  political  standpoint,  governance  is  in  fact  the  way  in  which\ngovernments manage the social and economic resources of a country. Therefore,\n\u201cgood\u201d governance would be the various levels of government exercising power\nin an effective, honest, fair, transparent, and responsible way. There are some\nprinciples clarifying the concept and giving it a more concrete framework.\nHowever,  these  concepts  vary  noticeably  according  to  the  international\ninstitutions  that  shaped  them  and  imposed  them  on  governments.  In  this\ninstance, being interested in the type of governance developed by an Asian\n\n1 Director of Studies and Training Courses Office, Royal School of Administration (RSA) of Cambodia.\n2 Technical Assistant to the RSA.\n3 Among  numerous  national Web  sites  dedicated  to  good  governance,  see  the  Canadian Web  site\n\nInstitute on Governance at http://www.iot.ca\n\n4 The  International  Monetary  Fund,  the  World  Bank,  the  European  Union,  and  many  other\ninternational institutions make available countless works on governance regarding the Asian region.\nThe Asian Development Bank\u2019s Web site is a good source of information on the subject, at http://\nwww.adb.org/Governance/default.asp.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n385\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f386\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\ncountry,  Cambodia,  we  will  focus  on  four  criteria  identified  by  the  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank:  accountability,  participation,  predictability,  and\ntransparency.5\n\nIn a developing country like Cambodia, good governance understandably\nbecomes a political priority and is at the heart of government reform. Numerous\ninternational institutions\u2014including the European Union, the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, the International Monetary Fund, ADB, and the\nWorld Bank\u2014have made good governance a core element of their development\nprograms. The political strategy of the Cambodian Government (2004\u20132008),\nwhich has been called a \u201crectangular strategy,\u201d has incorporated this requirement:\n\nFor the Royal Government, good governance is the prior and sine qua non\ncondition to sustainable economic development, characterized by equity\nand social justice. To reach the objectives of good governance requires the\nactive  participation  of  all  spheres  of  society,  more  extensive  sharing  of\ninformation, accountability, transparency, equality, integration and the rule\nof law (Council for the Development of Cambodia 2004).\n\nExceedingly  political,  good  governance  cannot  fail  from  having\n\nrepercussions in the legal arena.\n\nThus, in this study on public services, viewed as activities identified by\nthe state as required to meet the public interest\u2014generally speaking, public\nservices  cover  two  types  of  activities,  regalian  and  economic,  but  we  will\nconcentrate on economic services\u2014governance occurs in the development of\ntools whose status and workings lessen the nature departing from ordinary\nlaw, of which public services are traditionally the subject. Thus, the government\nstructure gets reshaped through the emergence of an independent authority\ncharged with the regulation of a sector. Regulation and governance are therefore\nbound and form the new paradigms of state reform. \u201cGood governance concern\nhas  thus  become  the  development  vehicle  for  independent  authorities\u201d\n(Chevalier 2003, page 216).\n\nIn  accordance  with  these  precepts,  Cambodia  does  not  escape  this\nuniversal tendency and is also subjected to regulation requirements. But does\nsuch a pattern meet the needs for solidarity, cohesion, and development of\nthis country, and does it allow the implementation of innovative tools for\npublic service management that could meet those expectations?\n\n5\n\nSee: http://www.adb.org/Governance/gov_elements.asp.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n386\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fInnovative Tools in the Governance of Public Services in Cambodia\n\n387\n\nIn order to comprehend these issues, a first look at the types of public\nservice regulation viewed as legal embodiments of good governance will take\nus, with more markers, on the path of developing-country regulation.\n\nPublic Service Control: Legal Embodiment of Good Governance\nPublic services liberalization and, as a result, their opening to competition\nhave led in developing countries to an increase in the number of independent\ninstitutions being charged with controlling and overseeing public services,\nwhich falls under the heading of regulation. These sectoral structures provide\na relevant field of analysis with regard to the principles introduced by the\nconcept of good governance, and they encourage their implementation. As a\nfactor for the evolution and revitalization of the classic institutional framework,\nregulation  leads  to  the  emergence  of  practices  that,  indeed,  underlie  the\nimplementation of precepts that good governance claims to follow.\n\nTheoretical Foundations of Public Service Legal Regulation\n\nUnfortunately,  regulation  does  not  have  a  precise  legal  definition.\nTherefore it is described in its most simplified form, or, following one\u2019s point\nof view, as an \u201caction to regulate a phenomenon (Cornu 2000).\n\nAt this stage, it seems difficult to be satisfied with such an approach,\neven though one can already emphasize the regulatory nature of regulation, as\nwell as its overall nature.\n\nThe  absence  of  a  specific  and  formalized  definition  is  tackled  in  the\nconsiderable  literature  on  the  subject  produced  in  the  various  fields  of\neconomics and social sciences. Regulation is a predominant issue in scientific\ndebate, and especially in the legal arena (Clam and Martin 1998, du Marais\n2004). Still, constant elements emerge from these varied researches that stress\nthe legal transformation logic embodied in the regulation designation. From\nthe viewpoint of crisis in modern law and of the monistic notion according to\nwhich the state would be the exclusive source of legal standards (Chevalier\n2003), regulation would offer a new type of standard whose institutional and\nfunctional aspects constitute the central theme of our research.\n\nGenerally speaking, regulation should make it possible to compensate\nfor weaknesses in society\u2019s two major players, the state and the market, to\nanswer legitimate questions regarding the workings of institutions (Timsit\n2004).  It  then  serves  as  the  balance  point  between  two  standards,  the\nspontaneous standard of the market and the imposed standard of the state.\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n387\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\f388\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nHowever, contrary to an approach that seems to be spreading, this does\n\nnot mean\n\nthe  disappearance  of  the Third  party  figure,  the  characteristic  figure  of\nlegally constituted State. It suggests on the other hand that this Third party,\nwhether it is the State, a judge or international organizations, does not\nhave the monopoly in regulation decrees anymore, since these also derive\nfrom a balance of power process (Supiot 2001).\n\nIn the field on which we are focusing, that of public services, the balance\nof power is set through state and market interaction in the first phase, but\nmust integrate user-consumer interest in the second phase.\n\nConsequently, with regard to opening these services to competition and\nconsequently to the progressive disappearance of a legal system departing from\ncommon law, regulation becomes a renewed type of public service management,\ncorresponding  to  \u201cthe  whole  intervention  of  the  authorities6  aimed  at\nimplementing competition\u2014as much as needed\u2014in a sector in which it did\nnot exist or hardly did, and at reconciling honest competition practice with\nthe mandate of public interest with which public service networks are invested\n(Bergougnoux 2000, page 212).\n\nRegulation therefore meets a double phenomenon: on one hand, public\nservices\u2019 liberalization, and, on the other hand, a redefinition of the state\u2019s role\nin the management of these services. Public service regulation is seen as a way\nof  setting  up  free  and  fair  competition  in  the  market  and  of  keeping  this\ncompatible with the public interest mandate linked to public service activities.\nThe issue of regulation is thus symbolized by its ability to make the two\nphenomenons\u2014free  trade  and  the  public  interest\u2014at  first  seemingly\ncontradictory, coexist. However, if one refers to theoreticians of the public\nservice  school  of  thought,  such  as  Hauriou,  \u201cThe  nature  of  public  service\ndoes not mean monopoly to the benefit of government authorities and their\nrepresentatives.\u201d Actually,  \u201cas  long  as  opening  to  competition  does  not\nconstitute an end in itself but a way meant to ensure public interest\u2019s greatest\nsatisfaction (Duguit, cited in Quiot 2002), contradictions disappear.\n\nIn order to fulfill this double mission, some regulatory authorities have\nbeen established in diverse legal systems, whether they come under common\nlaw  or  Roman-Germanic  law.  US  independent  regulatory  agencies,  British\n\n6\n\n\u201cThe public intervention needed when competition is introduced can be classified in several important\ncategories: to harmonize, control remaining monopoly sectors, promote fair competition in these\nsectors while guaranteeing public service mandates and protecting consumers\u2019 interests.\u201d\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n388\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fInnovative Tools in the Governance of Public Services in Cambodia\n\n389\n\nindependent  administrations,  and  also  French  independent  administrative\nauthorities\u2014regulatory\u2014authorities use various methods and have helped for\na long time to ensure \u201cregulation of some of the sensitive sectors\u201d and to look\nafter \u201cthe respect of some of the constituents\u2019 rights (Gentot 1994, page 16).\n\nHowever, worldwide dissemination of the regulation concept is proving\nto be much more recent and shows the advent of a new approach to public\nservice regulation, in particular the establishment of independent regulatory\nauthorities adopting operating procedures based on good governance as defined\nby the international community.\n\nPractical Implications of Public Service Legal Regulation\n\nRegulatory  authorities  have  various  responsibilities  according  to  the\nsectors they regulate. However, some general characteristics emerge. Those\nauthorities are usually involved in competition regulation and service access,\nand equipped with regulatory, decision, consultative, inquiry, information,\narbitration, and sanction powers. At these different stages, the implementation\nof transparency, participation, and accountability principles must be handled\nby the regulatory authorities.\n\nTransparency  constitutes  the  most  significant  aspect  of  regulatory\nauthorities\u2019 operations. On one hand, as far as the publication of deeds is\nconcerned, whether it is notices or decisions, most regulatory authorities have\ndeveloped procedures enabling access to information. Web sites, information\nnewsletters, and annual public reports, which give an account of activities\nand  regulatory  and  legislative  implementation  measures,  are  widely  used\ncommunication tools (Law n0 2000-108, article 32).\n\nOn the other hand, through assessment to check that for the purpose of\nchecking that public interest tasks entrusted by public powers have really been\naccomplished, regulatory authorities provide relevant information on whether\npublic  services  are  fulfilling  their  mandates.  In  fact,  as  the  European\nCommission  (2003,  page  30)  stresses,  \u201ca  global  assessment  increases\ntransparency  and  allows  for  better  political  choices  as  well  as  for  a  firmly\nsustained  democratic  debate.\u201d  In  this  regard,  assessment  must  take  into\nconsideration the interests and the opinions of all interested parties: users-\nconsumers (especially the vulnerable and marginalized groups), social partners,\nand other parties. Thus, it is important to determine what those parties consider\ngood performance and what their expectations are for the future.\n\nIt is therefore through a participatory process that an assessment can\nlegitimately reach its objectives. Participation proves to be a means of achieving\ntransparency, mostly through its consultation and consulting aspects.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n389\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f390\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nPublic  service  assessment,  public  inquiries,  and  the  creation  of  user\ncommittees in contact with regulatory authorities constitute the most common\nforms  of  users\u2019  participation.  For  example,  the  activities  of  French\nTelecommunications\u2019 Regulatory Agency (TRA) were based on an ongoing\nconsultation process with users and the market\u2019s players. For J. M. Hubert\n(2000), the agency\u2019s director general, \u201cpublic consultation, the working groups\nand  experiments  were  extremely  useful  working  tools.\u201d  More  recently,  the\nFrench  Agency  for  Communications  and  Post\u2019s  Regulation  (ACPR)  has\nplanned to hold episodic meetings for consultative authorities, and to organize\nregular  hearings,  meetings,  and  public  consultation  chiefly  to  request\ncomments.\n\nAnd yet, participation remains the most sensitive and ambiguous element.\nIts  implementation  is  not  a  new  notion  and  its  limitations  are  numerous.\nNevertheless, recent regulators\u2019 practices show a will to include users-consumers\nin the decision process and to collect their complaints. In Great Britain7 but\nalso in Western countries, the creation of consultative councils working with\nregulators has become common practice, mostly because of strong lobbying\nof regulators by consumers\u2019 associations. Similarly in the United States\u2014a\nprecursory country in liberalization terms\u2014regulatory authorities, especially\nin the electricity sector, have been undergoing major restructuring in order to\ngive  consumers  a  \u201cdefinite  majority  position  in  these  authorities  watching\nmarkets of the utmost importance\u201d (Greene 2000).\n\nAs the report of the French General Plan Commission points out, it\nseems  desirable  \u201cto  make  it  compulsory  to  submit  to  these  [consultative]\ncouncils cases in which decisions will directly effect consumers\u2019 interests or, in\nbroader terms, citizens\u2019, and conversely to allow these representatives to refer\nto regulators any problem they detect\u201d (Bergougnoux 2000, page 226).\n\nThis  last  point  brings  up  accountability  demands,  and  documents\nregarding the implementation of these regulatory authorities provide some\nsubstantial elements on the subject.\n\nThis  usually  must  make  a  regulator\u2019s  duties  incompatible  \u201cwith  any\nprofessional activity, any elective local council, departmental, regional, national\nor European mandate, any public job and any direct or indirect holding of\ninterest in a firm in the sector\u201d (Law n0 2000-108, article 28). Then, a double\ncontrol can be put in place: judicial control, for example, through appeals\nlodged against ACPR\u2019s decisions depending on the case;8 and political control,\n\n7 An  audit  conducted  in  1997  by  the  National  Audit  Office,  at  the  Labour  government\u2019s  request,\n\nemphasizes the democratic deficit in the workings of regulatory authorities.\n\n8 The ACPR\u2019s mandate and competence, at http://www.art-telecom.fr\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n390\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fInnovative Tools in the Governance of Public Services in Cambodia\n\n391\n\nmaking it mandatory for the authority to submit accounts of its activities at\nparliamentary  committees\u2019  request.  Finally,  the  obligation  of  supplying\nopinions and explanatory proposals constitutes a last defense against arbitrary\npower.\n\nAt different levels, regulatory authorities take part in the implementation\nof principles embodied in the concept of good governance, opening the way\nfor more lawful public service management with regard to users-consumers\u2019\nneeds. But is such an approach compatible with a developing country\u2019s reality?\nWhen simply talking about access to service, how to integrate notions such as\nquality, which is nevertheless a major users\u2019 demand in developed countries?\nThe development of regulatory authorities in developing countries has, in\nany case, become a reality. Through the example of Cambodia, we will attempt\nto bring up issues for discussion on this institutional and legal transposition\nthat recalls similar practices in other fields.\n\nPublic Service Regulation: The Reality of Good Governance\nPut to Development Test\n\nRegarding  the  process  of  administrative  reform  and  public  service\ndevelopment in Cambodia, the diffusion of good governance practices in public\naffairs management has become a significant priority. It applies to all public\nactivities without sparing the public service sector. And one finds again similar\ntypes of regulation, following the example of what has been put in place in\nWestern countries.\n\nThe Electricity Authority of Cambodia (EAC) is the first regulator of\nCambodia\u2019s public service. In spite of recent practices, it is already possible to\nglimpse its limitations and prospects in view of Cambodia\u2019s political, economic,\nand  cultural  society,  whose  references  and  operations  clearly  differentiate\nthemselves from Western models, and in which economic development dictates\nchoices and is confronted with realities often difficult to face.\n\nA Regulatory Model: The Electricity Authority of Cambodia\n\nElectricity is an important sector for Cambodia\u2019s development. It has\nsuffered the harmful effects of decades of war. Its opening to privatization\nmarks the transition from a centralized system to a liberalized economy. The\nlaw on electricity in Cambodia (Kram n0 NS/RKM/0201/03) passed in 2001\nby the Cambodian Parliament, was adopted with the goals of reinforcing the\nautonomy of the service management structure by avoiding recourse to grants;\npromoting  private  sector  participation  in  financing  and  networks  and\nproduction-tool development; improving minimum service access for most\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n391\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f392\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nof the population; and instituting a sector regulatory structure. With this law,\nthe first regulatory authority for a public service in Cambodia9 was created.\nThe EAC regulatory authority has the mandate10 of ensuring, as far as\nconsumers\u2019 rights are concerned, access to electricity, and of safeguarding public\ninterest by issuing licenses and guaranteeing reasonable rates. For that purpose,\nit consists of three members appointed by the executive power. At this stage,\nthis authority\u2019s institutional terms meet the general standards adopted by public\nservice  regulatory  authorities  in  developed  countries.  But  what  about  the\nimplementation of good governance principles\u2014do they play a role in this\nregulatory system?\n\nFirst, the accountability of this authority seems to be accepted to some\nextent.  If  one  may  deplore  the  absence  of  parliamentary  control,  political\ncontrol can, however, be exercised by the executive power. In addition, an\nappeal procedure for the public service\u2019s operations is available to users at the\nregulatory  authority,  whose  decision  can  be  appealed  before  a  court  of\ncompetent  jurisdiction. These  measures  are  complemented  by  numerous\nrequirements for transparency. Thus,\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  Electricity  Law  of The  Kingdom  of  Cambodia,\nEAC has the duty to collect the main data and relevant information from\nlicensees for preparing the Annual Report on Power Sector of the Kingdom\nof Cambodia. This report is for dissemination to the Royal Government,\ninstitutions,  investors  and  public  desirous  to  know  about  the  present\nsituation of the power sector of the Kingdom of Cambodia.\n\nIn  addition,  a  great  deal  of  information  is  available  at  the  regulatory\nauthority\u2019s Web site;11 its decisions and notices are explained and published;\nand  users\u2019  appeal  procedures  can  be  openly  obtained.  In  this  regard,  the\nregulatory authority seems to meet transparency requirements as mandated.\n\n9 However, a national regulatory authority for the new information communications technology has\nexisted  since  2000\u2014the  National  Information  Communications  Technology  Development\nAuthority\u2014with the mandate of promoting information technology development and regulating\nprojects implemented in the Kingdom of Cambodia. And yet, at the present time, this authority\ndoes not seem to perform its full functions of regulator.\n\n10 According to the law, the four key responsibilities of the Electricity Authority of Cambodia are to\n(i) establish a legal and reasonable environment in the power sector for promoting fair competition\nin electric power business, promoting long-term efficient and quality investment, and motivating\nthe private sector to play a role as to promoting economic growth; (ii) protect the right of the user to\nreceive continuous, qualitative, and adequate electric power supply at a reasonable tariff; (iii) establish\ncompetition where it can be done in the power sector; and (iv) establish the conditions so that the\nsupply and use of electric power will be efficient, qualitative, continuous, and transparent.\n\n11 http://www.eac.gov.kh.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n392\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fInnovative Tools in the Governance of Public Services in Cambodia\n\n393\n\nHowever, this set of measures, which comply with the implementation\nof  the  principles  of  good  governance,  fails  in  one  area,  that  of  users\u2019\nparticipation. The  constitutional  framework  of  1993  does  not  provide  for\ncitizens\u2019 participation. Moreover, the social organization does not legitimize a\nparticipative  system  because  of  the  preeminence  of  family  ties  and  the\nsolidarities  they  engender  (Jennar  1997,  Gaillard  1994).  In  addition,  the\nCambodian civil society remains rather unstructured and users-consumers\u2019\nrepresentation is virtually nonexistent. Lastly, \u201ctheir main concerns are acceding\nto a service...that will pave the way for modernity\u201d (Carlier, Gay, and Conan\n2001), which remains very far...\u201d which remains very far from the expectations\nof quality or respect for the environment voiced by users in developed countries.\nIn view of this, no form of participation is foreseen as part of the regulatory\n\nauthority\u2019s operations.\n\nHowever,  we  notice  numerous  citizens  taking  part  in  the  authority\u2019s\nfulfillment of one of its public service tasks through the acquisition of electricity\nlicenses.  In  recent  years,  there  has  been  an  increase  in  the  number  of\nindependent power companies whose activities are regulated by the regulatory\nauthority. This increase in the number of players-suppliers does not necessarily\ninvolve a recognition of users-citizens\u2019 needs and does not meet the logic for\nthe service. It marks a strong commercial approach that is not motivated by\npublic interest satisfaction.\n\nExclusion linked to poverty and the quality of the service remain sensitive\nissues that economic logic alone is not in a position to change. One of the\nregulatory authority\u2019s roles is therefore to create an environment favorable to\nprivate investors in order for them to meet public service mandates.\n\nLimitations and Prospects for Public Service Regulation in Cambodia\nBeyond the absence of participation, some intrinsic limitations prevail,\nnotably  the  characteristic  of  the  financial  and  human  cost  they  generate.\nActually, the establishment of a regulatory authority involves the recruitment\nof skilled persons and financial means to guarantee its independence.\n\nHowever,  this  independence  does  not  seem  to  correspond  with  the\npolitical reality, especially in relation to the executive power. Consequently,\nwe turn to the concept of impartiality developed in the report of the French\nGeneral Plan Commission (Bergougnoux 2000, page 214), which highlights\nthree elements for the achievement of the regulatory mandate achievement.\nFirst, the regulatory authority must have \u201csufficient means\u201d at its disposal to\ncomplete its task successfully. Second, its powers \u201cdo not have to be arbitrary,\nand therefore the authority must be answerable.\u201d Lastly, the tasks exercised by\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n393\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f394\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nthis authority are \u201cinside a framework that exceeds a single regulation, and\nthat the authority can legitimately establish.\u201d\n\nIn  a  country  like  Cambodia  in  which  human  resources  are  still\ninsufficient, an increase in the number of regulatory authorities would face a\nrecruitment problem and also a lack of funds. These limitations hinder the\ndevelopment  of  Cambodia\u2019s  institutions,  and  make  one  wonder  about  the\ncountry\u2019s prospects.\n\nCreating an environment for healthy and fair competition and ensuring\nequitable access for most of the population are necessary conditions for the\ndevelopment  of  public  services  in  Cambodia.  Good  governance  principles\nshould lead to the success of the process in which the regulatory authority has\na key role to play. But the transposition of operating approaches based on\nWestern models does not make it possible to overcome difficulties specific to\na developing country, in which recourse to justice, users\u2019 representation, and\nalso Internet access are far from similar.\n\nTherefore, do principles embodied in good governance remain of interest\nin  the  Cambodian  context,  and,  furthermore,  is  there  still  room  for\nparticipation?\n\nWhile it is a fact that fundamental freedoms and economic and social\nrights asserted in the constitution encourage the emergence of a civil society,\nwhich is widely politicized, this does not seem at the present time to really\nproduce a fertile breeding ground for users\u2019 participation.\n\nBut in a society in which preference for conciliation is declared by a\npolitical or social authority (Crouzatier 2001, page 149), participation adopts\ndifferent forms, less characterized by the formality and representation so dear\nto Western models.\n\nIn this context, assessment constitutes a modality for participation better\nadapted to Cambodian society premises. With the prospect of a developing\ncountry with institutional and legal mechanisms still distant from the citizens,\nthe possibility of having recourse to a mediator or of simply lodging a complaint\nenables  the  laying  of  foundations  for  a  public  service  assessment  process.\nThrough its complaint mechanism, the EAC authority is likely to provide\nindicators on public interest satisfaction. Through a synthesis of dissatisfied\nusers\u2019 comments, the regulatory authority could create an assessment model\nfor public service mandates. Thus, control methods could give users ways to\ntake part in the workings of public services. Users\u2019 satisfaction and the public\nservices\u2019 performance then become closely linked.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n394\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fInnovative Tools in the Governance of Public Services in Cambodia\n\n395\n\nThe people\u2019s office12 constitutes in this context a complementary initiative\nto regulatory authority work and its activities could extend to complaints on\nall public service operations. Initiatives like paying attention to the problems\nof users with few means, or assessing their public service needs and expectations,\nmaintain  an  ongoing  political  dialogue  and  establish  true  user-consumer\nparticipation in public service assessment.\n\nIn good governance, the regulatory authority makes it possible to support\nprivate investors by supplying them with transparent information and the\npossibility  of  lodging  appeals,  for  which  the  law  creating  EAC  has  made\nprovision. But it must also guarantee citizens a minimum level of service. The\nrecourse to mediation on a local and national scale for problem cases enables\nan assessment of public service tasks, and also supports the development of a\nmore harmonious society.\n\nIn this instance, the implementation of good governance standards does\nnot appear sufficient to guarantee public interest satisfaction, especially because\nof the arduous application of the participation  principle. The standards seem\nmore geared toward the satisfaction of private players\u2019 interest and the smooth\nfunctioning of the market. The protection of public interest seems to require\nthe definition and implementation of a regulatory authority based on standards\nother than those embodied in good governance.\n\n12 Article 12 of Decision n\u00b047 of 11 June 2003 of the Royal Government of Cambodia on the structure\nand  administration  of  Battambang  district,  Battambang  province,  and  Siem  Reap  district,  Siem\nReap  province,  states:  \u201cto  enhance  good  governance,  each  of  the  districts  shall  set  up  a  \u2018people\u2019s\noffice\u2019 which is tasked to receive complaints from and provide information to the locals, companies,\nenterprises and civil organizations regarding the irregularities and shortcomings carried out by staff\nat the district administration.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n395\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f396\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nReferences\n\nAgency  for  Communications  and  Post\u2019s  Regulation,  France.  n.d.  http://\n\nwww.art-telecom.fr (accessed on 10 October 2005).\n\nAsian Development Bank. 2003.

Low and MacMillan (1988) defined entrepreneurship\nas the \u201ccreation of new enterprise\u201d and proposed that entrepreneurship research\nseek to explain and facilitate the role of new enterprise in furthering economic\nprogress. By this definition, we can say that the entrepreneurial activities of\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) started at the end of 1970s, with the\nPRC\u2019s reform and opening that was begun in December 1978 by the Third\nPlenary Session of the 11th National Congress of the Communist Party of\nChina (CPC). Generally speaking, the evolution of entrepreneurship in the\n27 years since then can be divided into three stages.\n\nThe initiating stage covered the years from 1978 to 1984. Before the\nreforms, almost all of the enterprises in the PRC were uniformly owned by all\nthe people, that is, they were state-owned and state-run. A small number of\ncollectively owned enterprises did exist, but their managerial system was not\nessentially different from that of state-owned enterprises. Enterprises of any\nother ownership did not exist at all. State-owned enterprises are not enterprises\nin the real sense, but are administrative institutions under the control of the\nCPC and the Government. These so-called \u201centerprises\u201d are merely production\nunits that are neither independent nor creative. Starting from this basic reality,\nthe Government put forward the idea of \u201cdelegating power and sharing profits\u201d\nwith enterprises for carrying out reforms, while gradually establishing in the\ncountryside  a  household  contract  responsibility  system  with  remuneration\nlinked  to  output.  The  economic  responsibility  system  confirmed  the\nresponsibilities  and  rights  of  the  State,  enterprises,  and  farmers,  allowing\nenterprises and farmers to have at their disposal a certain amount of financial\nresources and economic benefits. In October 1984, the Third Plenary Meeting\nof the 12th National Congress of the CPC passed the Resolution on Reforming\n\n1 Chancellor for Academic Affairs, Chongqing Administration College, Chongqing, People\u2019s Republic\n\nof China.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n398\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fBuilding a Harmonious Entrepreneurial Ecology in the People\u2019s Republic of China\n\n399\n\nthe  Economic  System,  which  called  for  \u201cthe  whole  people,  collectives  and\nindividuals to go all out,\u201d and encouraged all sectors of the economy, whether\nowned by the whole people, the collectives, or individuals, or with foreign\nfunds, to cooperate with each other by establishing contractual joint ventures,\nequity joint ventures, or associations. Small state-led enterprises were allowed\nto be \u201clet out\u201d or \u201ccontracted\u201d to collective or individually owned enterprises.\nDuring this stage, four different entrepreneurial models arose in eastern and\nsouthern PRC: the WenZhou model, in the \u201crushing market\u201d style adopted\nby  farmers  with  limited  resources  (Fei  Xiaotong  1986,  Shi  Jinchuan  et  al.\n2002); the SuNan model, based on the township and village enterprise tradition\nand technology from Shanghai industry (Fei Xiaotong 1983); and the ZhuJiang\nand JinJiang models, patterned after overseas models (Gong Weibin 2000,\nXie Jian 2002).\n\nThe exploring stage covered the years from 1985 to 1991. Starting from\nthe Third Plenary Session of the 12th National Congress of the CPC, the\ncentral emphasis for reforming the PRC\u2019s economy shifted from rural areas to\nurban areas, and the reform of state-owned enterprises was identified as the\ncentral  link  in  the  reforms.  During  this  period,  reforms  in  state-owned\nenterprises, as their most prominent feature, distinguished between the roles\nof government and enterprise, and separated the right to own from the right\nto run. To this end, the Government promoted the responsibility system of\ncontracted operation, and implemented the system of leased operation in some\nsmall state-owned enterprises. The 13th National Congress of the CPC in\n1987 further proposed that the joint-stock system be tried out as one form of\nproperty organization. The property rights of small state-owned enterprises\ncould  now  be  transferred  to  collectives  or  individuals  in  exchange  for\nremuneration.  In  December  1986,  the  Standing  Committee  of  the  Sixth\nNational  Congress  passed  the  Enterprise  Bankruptcy  Law  (Trial),  which\nstipulated that insolvent enterprises could apply for bankruptcy. In April 1988,\nthe First Session of the Seventh National People\u2019s Congress passed the Enterprise\nLaw. This was the first law for state-owned enterprises since the founding of\nthe PRC. In addition, to protect the non-state-owned sector and provide legal\nguarantees for its development, policies, rules, and regulations were successively\nissued. Among these were the Interim Regulations for the Administration of\nUrban and Rural Individual Industrial and Commercial Businesses, the Law\nof Foreign Invested Enterprises, and the Provisional Regulations of Private\nEnterprises. The  non-state-owned  sector  made  significant  breakthroughs\nduring this period. Between 1985 and 1991, state-owned industry output\ngrew by only 8.3% yearly on average, while the output of non-state-owned\nindustry  grew  by  as  much  as  23.9%  yearly.  Compared  with  state-owned\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n399\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f400\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nenterprises, non-state-owned enterprises were on the whole independent market\nentities, possessing relatively independent market rights and pursuing relatively\nindependent  economic  benefits.  In  addition,  the  ZhongGuanCun\nentrepreneurial model, representative of technology entrepreneurship, arose\nin Beijing (Xie Jian 2002).\n\nThe expanding stage began in 1992 and extends up to the present. In\nNovember 1993, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th National Congress of\nthe CPC passed the CPC Central Committee\u2019s Decision on Several Issues for\nEstablishing a Socialist Market Economy System, which stated that the \u201cmarket\nwas  to play a  fundamental role concerning the resources under the macro\ncontrol by the State\u201d; that \u201cthe State was to create the conditions for all sectors\nof the economy to participate in the market competition on an equal footing,\nand enterprises from all sectors would be treated indiscriminately.\u201d In 1997,\nthe 15th National Congress of the CPC further stated that \u201cthe non-public\nsector  is  an  important  component  part  of  this  country\u2019s  socialist  market\neconomy.\u201d This statement was incorporated into the Constitution when it\nwas amended in 1999. The status and the role of the non-state-owned sector,\nespecially  the  private  sector,  in  China\u2019s  economic  structure  were  officially\nconfirmed. In 2003, the Third Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee\nof the CPC, in a break from non-state economic theory and policies, decided\nto  actively  guide  the  development  of  the  private  sector. The  Constitution\namended  in  2004  stated  that  \u201cthe  lawful  private  property  of  citizens  is\ninviolable.\u201d In 2005, the State Administration of Industry and Commerce\nreformed its registration system to better serve private enterprises. In addition,\nthe transformation of state-owned enterprises, aimed at establishing a modern\nenterprise system, was implemented in 1994. While the transformation was\ncontinuously  pursued,  an  exit  mechanism  for  state-owned  enterprises  was\ngradually taking shape. According to a survey done in 2002, 25.8% of private\nenterprises  had  been  transformed  from  state-owned  enterprises.  The\nconfirmation and protection afforded by the policies and laws of the State to\nthe status of non-state-owned enterprises as market entities encouraged the\nrapid development of the sector. Entrepreneurial activities, even including\nhome entrepreneurship, are expanding all over China (Wang Xiyu et al. 2003).\nTo sum up, even as the PRC\u2019s reforms and development enterprises have\nmade the transition to a market economy, entrepreneurship has continuously\nbeen on the rise. According to statistics from the departments in charge of\nsmall and medium enterprises (SMEs), there were around 10 million SMEs\n(14.8% of them state-owned) in 2004, accounting for 99% of all registered\nenterprises in the country, 60% of the national industrial output value, and\n40% of national revenue, and employing 75% of the labor force.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n400\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fBuilding a Harmonious Entrepreneurial Ecology in the People\u2019s Republic of China\n\n401\n\nEntrepreneurial Ecology: Features and Problems\n\nEntrepreneurial ecology refers to the entire entrepreneurial environment.\nIn the PRC, it normally refers to the development environment. The term\nwas first used by local administrators in their efforts to further local economic\ndevelopment, and later became an approach to deepen reform and advance\ndevelopment. The Decision on Several Issues for Consummating a Socialist\nMarket Economy System, passed in 2003 by the Third Plenary Session of the\n16th Central Committee of the CPC, transformed the role of government to\nthat of serving market agents and creating a good development environment.\nThe  Decision  on  Strengthening  the  Party\u2019s  Governing  Capacity,  passed  in\n2004 by the Fourth Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee of the\nCPC, pointed out that the Party\u2019s governing capacity embodies, first of all,\nthe Party\u2019s ability to lead development, and that one of its most important\naspects was to serve market agents and build a good development environment.\nIn  this  paper  we  use  \u201centrepreneurial  environment,\u201d  \u201cdevelopment\nenvironment,\u201d and \u201centrepreneurial ecology\u201d interchangeably. Gnyamali and\nFogel (1994) defined the entrepreneurial environment as a combination of\nfactors that play a role in the development of entrepreneurship. First, it refers\nto  the  overall  economic,  sociocultural,  and  political  factors  that  influence\npeople\u2019s willingness and ability to undertake entrepreneurial activities. Second,\nit refers to the availability of assistance and support services that facilitate the\nstart-up  process.  Using  this  definition,  we  may  view  the  evolution  of\nentrepreneurial ecology in the PRC as follows.\n\nFirst, the widening of entrepreneurship is related to the Party\u2019s ideological\nand theoretical rebuilding. During the era of the planned economy, private\nproperty was viewed as the root of all evil. But under the leadership of Deng\nXiaoping, from the late 1970s, the Government put forward a plan to develop\nprivate companies in order to adapt to the people\u2019s pursuit of personal wealth.\nIndeed, these policies have become a driving force behind the PRC\u2019s economic\ngrowth. On the macro level, the most fundamental characteristic of economic\nreform in the PRC is the transition from a planned economy to a market\neconomy through the dual-track system\u2014developing the elements (or sectors)\nof a new system side by side with the old unreformed system, and then, if\nthings go well, reforming the old system in line with the positive developments\nemerging from the new components of the economy. This reform strategy\nmay  not  justify  itself  by  \u201celiminating  efficiency  loss\u201d  or  \u201cminimizing  the\nimplementation costs\u201d of the reform, but may reduce the costs of political\nconflict  the  reform  may  generate  in  the  real  world.  On  the  micro  level,\nownership reform is at the core of economic system reform in the PRC. For\nexample, the State Statistical Office used to present data for seven different\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n401\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f402\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nclasses  of  enterprise  ownership:  individual  ownership,  private  ownership,\nforeign  ownership,  joint  ownership,  shareholding  corporations,  collective\nownership, and state ownership. Theoretically, the PRC\u2019s economic reform\ncannot completely succeed until major reform of the ownership structure is\nundertaken in the state sector, and the sooner and more aggressively actions\nare taken to improve the conditions for conducting ownership reform, the\nlower the costs of the transition. However, ownership reform will not only\nencounter  strong  resistance  but  also  be  technically  difficult  to  implement.\nEven today, the ownership reform of state-owned enterprises still evokes extensive\ndiscussion but with less insightful measures (Lang Xianping et al. 2004).\n\nThe  ideological  and  theoretical  rebuilding  is  helped  along  by  policy\npractices that directly drive entrepreneurial activities. So the entrepreneurial\nopportunities are uneven. Among the typical models of entrepreneurship, the\nZhuJiang, ZhongGuanCun, and JinJiang models, and even the SuNan model,2\nare opportunity-driven and based on favorable policies or resource accessibility,\nwhile the WenZhou model is a model of survival-driven entrepreneurship. In\ngeneral, the socialist planned economy was a quiet life where everything was\n\u201cfixed.\u201d The right to decide was concentrated in the hands of a small group of\npeople; most of the people did not make many choices for themselves, and\neven for those who were decision-makers, most of the work was routine since\nthe environment was stable. There was little need for initiative, creativity, and\ninnovation. People who have lived for decades under such a system cannot\neasily adjust to a market economy, where everyone needs to make his or her\nown choice in an uncertain environment. It takes time for them to learn how\nto deal with price fluctuation, uncertainty, a range of choices, and competition.\nAn entrepreneurial society takes time to emerge (Drucker 1984), as the PRC\nis finding out.\n\nSecond, entrepreneurial ecology in the PRC has been dominated by local\ngovernment. PRC\u2019s economic reform has been an experimental process (Zhang\nWeiying  et  al.  2005),  with  reform  experiments  based  in  regions  (typically\ncities), sectors, or even firms. If a reform program succeeds in the selected\nregions, sectors, or enterprises, it is implemented in other regions, sectors, or\nenterprises; if it fails, it is stopped. Experiment is used not only for single\nreform programs, but also for comprehensive reform. Decentralization was\none way of governance reform by the central leadership (Shi et al. 1993). So\ngovernment entrepreneurship at the local, even grassroots, level is an important\n\n2\n\nIn the PRC, place-names are used to define the different regional models of development. ZhuJiang\nis  in the south;  ZhongGuancun is in Beijing; JinJiang, SuNan, and WenZhou are in the east.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n402\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fBuilding a Harmonious Entrepreneurial Ecology in the People\u2019s Republic of China\n\n403\n\nfeature  of  the  reform  process.  Many  reform  programs  started  by  local\ngovernments or at the grassroots level were later recognized and adopted as\nnational policies by the central Government. This was the case with agriculture\nreform  in  Anhui  Province,  industry  reform  in  Sichuan  Province,  and  the\ndevelopment  of  stock  exchanges  in  Shanghai  and  Shenzhen.  In  fact,  local\ngovernments and the grassroots are important inner-system forces against the\nmore conservative central ministerial bureaucrats. This does not necessarily\nmean that local governments act contrary to the will of the central leaders,\nbut the local governments have greater flexibility and can influence actions\ntaken on a larger scale. Local governments dismantled much of the central\nplanning system. Many are far ahead of the national leadership in reforming\nthe economy. Reform has been both a top-to-bottom and a bottom-to-top\nprocess (Chen et al. 1992).\n\nThe entrepreneurial efforts of local governments have reaped broad gains\nin economic development and public administration reform. On the one hand,\nlocal economic development is the main force pushing local administration\nreform, since political reform lags behind economic reform as a whole. On\nthe other hand, local administrators have a strong impetus for development\nbecause their performance is assessed mainly on the basis of gross domestic\nproduct (GDP). Chongqing, a young municipality, struggled mightily on the\nway to the \u201ceconomic center of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River\u201d while\ndirectly under the central Government. But in 2000, Chongqing launched a\n\u201ccomprehensive renovation activity for development environment\u201d with the\naim of becoming within 3 years one of the best areas in entrepreneurial ecology\nin western PRC. It sought efforts from \u201ceverybody, every time, for each action,\nand everywhere.\u201d So the city planned measures, called \u201c10 passels,\u201d for each\nof the 3 years. In 2002, the \u201c10 passels\u201d comprised measures for coping with\nentry into the World Trade Organization, boosting consumption, administering\nmore  capably,  stopping  makers  of  counterfeit  goods,  sprucing  up  tourism\ndestinations, invigorating trade in farm products, developing specialty markets,\neliminating safety hazards in production, clearing up pollution, and burnishing\nshowcase areas. Growth pressures and expectations may, however, lead local\ngovernments to take shortsighted actions, such as land or mine exploitation\nto maximize revenue.\n\nGiven  the  local  differences  in  resource  endowments  and  policy\nopportunities, entrepreneurial activities have exhibited wide regional variations.\nIn the late 1980s, some coastal areas such as Guangdong Province became\nquasi-market  economies,  while  most  inland  areas  were  still  dominated  by\ncentral planning. The level of entrepreneurship mirrors the level of economic\ndevelopment. Take the private-owned enterprises as an example. There were\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n403\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f404\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\n3.44 million of these in 2004, and eight provinces or municipalities (Jiangsu,\nGuangdong, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Shandong, Beijing, Liaoning, and Sichuan)\neach had more than 1 million private-owned enterprises, all accounting for\n63.24% of the national total. These same eight provinces or municipalities\ncontributed more than half of GDP. As for the entrepreneurs, those from the\ncoastal areas are opportunity-focused, while their counterparts from western\nPRC are necessity-driven, according to Zhang Yuli et al. (2003).\n\nThird, entrepreneurial ecology now faces many problems. Reform with\nthe approach of \u201cgroping for stones to cross the river,\u201d or dealing with the\nproblems  one  by  one,  is  inevitable.  Surveys  done  in  recent  years  on  the\ndevelopment profiles of private-owned enterprises described the evolution and\nthe main problems that beset entrepreneurial ecology. The Basic Units Census\nin  2001  indicated  the  challenges  faced  by  private-owned  enterprises:\nstandardizing  the  criteria  for  market  entry,  ensuring  fair  taxes  and  fees,\nregulating contracts between government and enterprises, providing finance\nand credit guarantees, making procedures more transparent and stable, building\na credit system, and safeguarding property rights. Another survey organized\nin  2002  by  the  United  Front  Work  Department  of  the  CCP  Central\nCommittee, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the\nSociety of Private Economy Research revealed that social security, barriers to\nentry, fair competition, fee standardization, accessibility of financing, and access\nto  overseas  markets  were  the  main  problems  of  private-owned  enterprises,\nand that unfair competition was a heavy barrier to development. In 2003, the\nChina Entrepreneur Survey recognized that entrepreneurs running the private-\nowned enterprises were looking for streamlined bureaucratic procedures, the\nrule of law, more transparent policies and procedures, reforms in the financial\nsystem, fewer barriers to financing, a reduction in monopolies, and reforms\nin  the  earnings  tax  system.  In  2004,  the  Corporation  Survey  of  the  State\nStatistical Office revealed that the five main problems of non-state enterprises\nwere low access to financing, undisciplined public servants, policy distortions\nduring implementation, lack of provisions for social security, and inadequately\ntrained human resources.\n\nDevelopment of Entrepreneurial Ecology: An Emerging\nUnderstanding\n\nAlthough the development environment concept in the PRC arose in\nthe special context of a country in transition, studies on entrepreneurial ecology\ndate  back  to  earlier  entrepreneurial  research  in  the West.  Pennings  (1982)\ninvestigated  how  human  ecology  and  the  quality  of  urban  life  influenced\nfrequency variations in organizational start-ups in 70 urban-metropolitan areas\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n404\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fBuilding a Harmonious Entrepreneurial Ecology in the People\u2019s Republic of China\n\n405\n\nin the United States. Specht (1993) combined two streams of research and\ntheory development, resource dependence and population ecology, to develop\na model of relationship between organization formation, on the one hand,\nand  environmental  munificence  and  carrying  capacity,  on  the  other.\n\u201cEnvironmental  munificence\u201d  refers  to  the  degree  of  resource  abundance.\n\u201cCarrying  capacity\u201d  is  related  to  the  density  or  number  of  organizations\ncompeting for the same resources in a niche. So Specht (1993) came up with\na  five-dimension  model  comprising  the  social,  economic,  political,\ninfrastructure, and market emergence dimensions. The social dimension refers\nto social networks, support of social-political elites, and cultural acceptance.\nThe  economic  dimension  refers  to  capital  availability,  aggregate  economic\nindicators, unemployment, etc. The political dimension refers to support from\ngovernment. The infrastructure dimension refers to quality of life, education\nsystem, transportation and communication system, nature of the local labor\nmarket, information accessibility, etc. The market emergence dimension refers\nto niche emergence and technological innovation. Gnyawali and Fogel (1994)\ndeveloped  a  framework  for  understanding  the  environmental  conditions\nconducive to entrepreneurship. This framework consists of five dimensions\nlinked to the core elements of new-venture creation\u2014developing opportunities,\nenhancing entrepreneurial propensity, and promoting entrepreneurial ability.\nThe five dimensions are government policies and procedures, socioeconomic\nconditions,  entrepreneurial  and  business  skills,  finance  support,  and  non-\nfinance  support.  Armington  and  Acs  (2002)  examined  the  role  of  human\ncapital, training and education, and entrepreneurial environment in new-firm\nformation in 394 labor market areas in the United Sates. As a result of the\nstudy, the authors attributed variations in firm birth rates to industrial density,\npopulation, and income growth.\n\nLi Shaomin et al. (2004) used data on 30 provinces, 566 cities, 2,612\ncounties, and more than 20,000 townships in the PRC to empirically analyze\nthe variations in the ownership structure of new firms.

Social justice is now an important challenge in the PRC, owing to\nthe large differences between city and countryside, between the eastern and\nwestern parts of the country, and between income classes.

However, the means of support should\nchange somehow, for support is firstly dominated by justice. Ecological cost\nincludes not only economic cost, but also institutional cost and moral cost.\nAfter  1992,  local  governments  mostly  paid  more  attention  to  \u201chard\u201d\nenvironment  building,  and  focused  on  economic  cost.  For  example,  they\ncompeted with one another in selling land at lower prices to attract capital\ninvestment. Today, the Government shall put more efforts on the \u201csoft\u201d and\n\u201cdeeper\u201d part of entrepreneurial ecology building. Ecological modeling is the\nbasic way for entrepreneurs to become more socially aware and extend their\nentrepreneurial activities.\n\nEntrepreneurship  is  crucial  for  the  efficiency  of  a  market  economy.\nEntrepreneurship is also a basic precondition of economic growth (Piazza-\nGeorgi 2002). After 27 years of reform, the PRC\u2019s private sector economy is\nbecoming  a  force  to  equal  the  state-owned  economy.  Future  economic\ndevelopment in the PRC depends on the dissolution of the dual economic\nstructure in which a vibrant private sector coexists with a lethargic state-owned\nsector. As Premier Wen Jiabao (2005) asserted when discussing \u201cSome Opinions\nRegarding the State Council\u2019s Encouragement and Support of the Development\nof the Non-state-owned Economy\u201d:\n\nNot only does encouraging, supporting and guiding the development of\nthe non-state-owned economy help promote the economic prosperity in\nurban and rural areas and increase fiscal revenue, it is also beneficial in\ncreating new jobs, bettering the lives of the people, improving the economic\nstructure and accelerating economic growth. It also has important strategic\nsignificance in realizing an all-round well-off society and in pushing forward\nthe process of socialist modernization.\n\nEntrepreneurship in the non-state-owned economy will intensify. Hu\nJintao (2005) writes about the harmonious society\u2014where there is democracy\nand nomocracy, justice and equity, honesty and fraternity, energy and vitality,\nstability and orderliness, and concordance between human and nature\u2014as\nthe social target for socialism, PRC-style.\n\nToward the goal of entrepreneurial ecology building, which by its very\nnature is a process of learning by doing, the PRC has now reached the fourth\nstage of entrepreneurship\u2014the normal, everyday stage.\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n407\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\f408\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nReferences\n\nArmington C.

It is intended to shift the focus of budgeters\nand  policy  makers  from  internal  control  and  input  to  the  efficiency  and\noutcomes of programs, so that performance information is used to enhance\nthe quality of budget deliberations and decision making and so that resources\nare allocated more effectively to meet the expectations of politicians and the\npublic (Schick 1966, US GAO 2001).\n\nThe 1990s were a golden era for PBB reform. The US Congress passed\nthe Chief Financial Officer Act of 1990 and the Government Performance\nand Results Act of 1993, which together laid down the legislative foundation\nfor PBB reforms in recent years. The George W. Bush administration also\ninitiated a performance rating scheme that ties agency performance to program\nfunding requests (Peckenpaugh 2002). In addition to reforms at the federal\nlevel, many US state and local governments introduced their own version of\nPBB in the 1990s (Berman and Wang 2000, NASBO 2002, Poister and Streib\n1999, Willoughby and Melkers 2000).4 Despite criticism from skeptics about\nthe results of these efforts, the momentum of reform has remained strong.\n\nPBB has also advanced rapidly in other countries in the Organisation\nfor Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) over the past decade\nbecause many politicians see it as a way to make government more competitive\nand cost-efficient and a possible response to cynical taxpayers who demand\n\n1 Assistant Professor, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, People\u2019s Republic of China.\n2 Associate Professor, Indiana University\u2013Purdue University Indianapolis, United States of America.\n3\n\nProfessor, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\n4\n\nBy the end of the 1990s, 47 of the 50 US states had some sort of performance-oriented budgeting\nrequirements, 31 had legislated how the process was to be conducted, and 16 had specifically tied\nthe reform to budget guidelines or instructions (Willoughby and Melkers 2000).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n410\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fPerformance-Based Budgeting in China: A Case Study of Guangdong\n\n411\n\nmore accountable government spending. Many have expanded the practice of\nPBB and introduced new legislation that requires performance measurement\nand benchmarking (Helgason 1997). For those countries that have been using\nperformance measurement for a number of years, many have also begun to\nshift their focus to reporting outcome and to building a stronger link between\nperformance measurement and budgeting (OECD 2002, Perrin 2003).\n\nPBB initiatives have not been introduced solely in developed countries\nover the past decade. India, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand,\nfor example, have all introduced their own versions of PBB (Dean 1986, OECD\n2002, Straussman 2005). Some of these countries have adopted the reform to\nreduce waste, enhance government efficiency, and increase public satisfaction\nwith public programs. Others have adopted PBB because of external pressure\nfrom donor countries and international organizations, which have begun to\ndemand more transparency in recipient countries to demonstrate how grant\nresources are used and what results foreign aid has brought.\n\nRegardless of the motivation for reform, there is little doubt that PBB\nhas become more widespread among both developed and developing countries\ntoday than it was a decade ago. Its worldwide popularity, however, does not\nimply that it always offers a quick fix for many governmental problems. Quite\nthe contrary, the decades-long experience of Western countries in PBB reforms\nshows that PBB tends to create many new challenges for policy makers and\nrequires tremendous time and resource commitments in implementation.\n\nThis  paper  examines  these  challenges  in  the  context  of  the  People\u2019s\nRepublic of China (PRC). In 2003, Guangdong became the first provincial\ngovernment in the PRC to initiate PBB reform. Through personal interviews\nwith  Guangdong  officials  and  documentation  analyses,  we  evaluated  the\nimplementation  process  and  analyzed  the  administrative  and  political\nchallenges that Guangdong reformers may face in the future. In the following\ndiscussion,  we  first  review  the  reform  experiences  of  developed  countries,\nprimarily the US, to highlight some of the factors critical to the success of\nPBB reforms. Then we apply the framework to an analysis of the recent PBB\nreform in Guangdong.\n\nCritical Factors in PBB Success: Western Experiences\n\nIn the past few decades, many studies have been done to evaluate the\nsignificance, challenges, and impact of PBB in the US and other developed\ncountries. The general consensus is that, if implemented effectively, PBB can\nhelp improve the communication between the legislative and executive branches\nand the communication between the budget office and departments (Lee 1997,\nWilloughby and Melkers 2000). It can also encourage stronger accountability\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n411\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f412\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nand customer focus, and better strategic planning to guide program decisions\nand management (Broom and McGuire 1995, Barrett and Greene 2002, Hatry\n1999, US GAO 2000, GASB 2002, Melkers and Willoughby 2001).\n\nHowever, these potential benefits cannot happen in a vacuum. A close\nexamination of Western experiences, particularly in the US, shows that an\norganizational, technological, and cultural infrastructure has to be present to\nmake PBB work. These fundamental success factors include the following.\n\nTop Leadership Support, Emphasis, and Legislative Mandate\n\nTop leadership support is critical in any governmental reform. If the top\nleadership is enthusiastic and shows full support for the reform, the lower\nhierarchy of the organization is more likely to take the reform seriously and\nimplement it faithfully. Legislative mandate can often help to reinforce the\npolitical  urgency  and  importance  of  the  reform.  Passing  performance\nmeasurement requirements as law and specifying how government officials\nshould  follow  the  requirements  gives  government  officials  the  legal\nresponsibility to implement the reform and makes them accountable if they\nfail to do so. The Government Performance Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 of\nthe  US  federal  Government  is  an  example  of  legislative-mandated  reform\n(Radin 2000). Many PBB reforms in US state governments are also initiated\nand required by state legislatures to make sure that the executive branch will\nfollow through (Willoughby and Melkers 2000). New Zealand has likewise\nrelied on legislation, including the Public Finance Act of 1989 and the Fiscal\nResponsibility Act of 1994, to guide the progress of PBB reforms.\n\nA Solid Foundation of Cost Accounting in Government\n\nA key performance measure is cost-efficiency. However, to accurately\naccount for cost-efficiency, a government must first build a reliable and accurate\ncost accounting system for all government programs and budget items (Breul,\nforthcoming; US GAO 2003). The system must cover all direct functional\nexpenses, such as salaries, benefits, and supplies, as well as overhead costs,\nsuch as administrative overhead, rent and physical building costs, and utilities.\nIn addition, a clear methodology must be developed for allocating these costs\nnot only to departments, but also to various programs within each department,\nso that the program cost data can be compared with the output and outcome\ndata to determine cost-efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n412\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fPerformance-Based Budgeting in China: A Case Study of Guangdong\n\n413\n\nA Clearly Defined and Well-organized Budgeting Structure\n\nA budgeting structure is the fundamental infrastructure of PBB reform.\nAt the very least, a government should have a well-defined line-item budget\nfor all departments and programs, so that government managers and policy\nmakers can hold departments accountable for financial management results.\nHowever,  to  truly  implement  PBB,  the  line-item  budget  must  be\nreorganized by program, which can be multi-departmental, and aligned with\na clearly defined structure of strategic goals and targets. This allows government\nofficials and policy makers to see more clearly what social and economic goals\nthey are trying to accomplish, how much resources are budgeted to accomplish\nthese goals, and what results these resources have achieved at the end of the\nfiscal  year. This  alignment  exercise  can  be  very  difficult,  costly,  and  time-\nconsuming. In the US, for example, the federal Government has spent decades\nto align the goals of many federal programs, but has made significant progress\nonly in recent years (US GAO 2002).\n\nAn Effective Administrative Mechanism for Budgeting\n\nHaving a budgetary structure is not sufficient. Someone must enforce\nand monitor the use of the structure and rules, and use the information to\nimprove  the  performance  of  government  programs.  In  the  US,  this\nresponsibility  falls  primarily  on  the  executive  budget  office  within  each\ndepartment. Successful PBB reform often requires giving these budget offices\nsufficient manpower, legal authority, and analytical capacity to help program\nmanagers analyze and use performance results effectively (Lee, Johnson, and\nJoyce 2004).\n\nEqually  important  is  the  central  budget  office,  which  oversees  all\ndepartmental budget requests. It is often responsible for providing budgetary\nguidelines and priorities to departments and agencies. It also helps compile\nand analyze departmental performance information so that the information\ncan be integrated into the executive\u2019s budget requests.\n\nA Well-defined Strategic Plan and Goal Structure for Agencies\nto Define \u201cPerformance\u201d\n\nAnother success factor is having a well-defined strategic plan and goal\nstructure  with  which  performance  measurement  can  be  aligned.  Previous\nstudies on PBB show that the reform can help program managers see more\nclearly what they are trying to accomplish and rethink how they can accomplish\nthose goals more effectively (Ho, forthcoming; Willoughby and Melkers 2000;\nUS GAO 2004). However, these benefits can be realized only if there is a\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n413\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f414\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nstrategic planning process that defines the long-term and short-term goals\nand the performance targets of public programs.\n\nCompetent Budget Analysts and Program Managers to Handle\nProgram Evaluation\n\nPBB  also  requires  the  presence  of  many  competent  and  well-trained\nbudget analysts and program evaluators within each department and at the\nbudget office. These analysts need to understand not only program operation\nand  budgeting,  but  also  evaluation  methodology  and  different  types  of\nperformance measurement (Melkers and Willoughby 2001). They may require\ntraining not only in cost accounting, statistics, and budgetary analysis, but\nalso in program evaluation, policy analysis, and other public administration\nskills.\n\nOrganizational Capacity to Handle Program Evaluation\n\nPersonnel capacity is just one of the building blocks of successful PBB\nreform. A government also needs to build other administrative capacity, for\ndata  collection  and  analysis,  among  other  things  (Newcomer  and  Scheirer\n2001). The use of modern information technologies can offer tremendous\nhelp  and  time  savings.  Many  city  governments  in  the  US  today  use  a\ncomputerized system that tracks the time they receive an emergency call for\npolice or fire assistance, the type of assistance needed, and the amount of time\nit takes for the police or fire department to arrive at the scene. Without these\ninformation technologies, performance measurement would be very costly\nand difficult to implement effectively and accurately.\n\nPositive and Negative Incentives for Workers to Focus\non Performance\n\nPositive incentives are important because they reward government officials\nwho perform well and encourage them to enhance public program efficiency\nand  effectiveness. These  positive  incentives  may  include  financial  rewards,\nsuch as performance bonuses, faster and better promotion, and higher salaries.\nThey  can  also  be  nonfinancial,  such  as  public  recognition  of  the\naccomplishments of a program or a department.\n\nDisincentives can also be used, but more cautiously, because they tend\nto generate opposition to the reform and insubordination. Disincentives may\ninclude delays in promotion or salary raise, and public shaming of the people\nwho are in charge of a poorly performing program.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n414\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fPerformance-Based Budgeting in China: A Case Study of Guangdong\n\n415\n\nCultural Shift to \u201cResults-oriented\u201d Management\n\nFor PBB reform to succeed, officials must also be helped to understand\nthat the old ways of managing programs and budgets are no longer enough,\nand that the government needs to develop a new organizational culture that\nemphasizes  public  accountability  and  results.  PBB  is  not  just  about  data\ncollection  and  reporting.  It  is  a  cultural  transformation  that  requires\ngovernment officials to think and work differently (Wholey 2002).\n\nTime for the Reform to Sink In and Make a Difference\n\nFinally, the Western reform experience shows that a successful PBB system\ntakes a long time to evolve and happens incrementally. In the US, the first\nsystematic PBB reform, the planning, programming, and budgeting system\n(PPBS), was introduced in the federal Government in the late 1960s. It was\nlater followed by zero-based budgeting, management by objectives, and national\nperformance review. Today, the US federal Government has an elaborate system\nthat  links  performance  information  with  strategic  goals  and  budgetary\ninformation.  However,  after  four  decades  of  implementation  and\nexperimentation, the federal Government still struggles with many technical\nand administrative issues in performance measurement and needs more time\nand effort to refine its current system (US GAO 1997).\n\nPerformance-based Budgeting in Guangdong Province\n\nBackground\n\nThe  lessons  from  Western  countries  provide  a  useful  framework  for\nanalyzing and evaluating some of the potential challenges faced by PBB reforms\nin developing countries, including the PRC. In recent years, several subnational\ngovernments in the country have paid close attention to the development of\nperformance measurement and performance budgeting in developed countries\nand  have  introduced  their  own  versions  of  PBB  reform  to  rationalize  and\nsystematize their budgeting. These reforms include departmental budgetary\nreform,  zero-based  budgeting,  procurement  management,  and  treasury\nmanagement (Ma and Niu, forthcoming). Several local governments, such as\nthose  of  Hebei  City,  Shenzhen  City,  and  Guangdong  Province,  are  often\nrecognized as pioneers among their peers (Niu 2005).\n\nIn 2003, Guangdong Province became the first provincial government\nin the PRC to launch PBB reform. The province, located in Southern PRC, is\nwell known for bold economic and political reforms. In the late 1970s, it was\nselected by the central Government as the first experimental area for market-\noriented reforms. Since then, the province has transformed its economy and\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n415\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f416\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nexperienced rapid economic growth. In 2003, Guangdong\u2019s per capita gross\ndomestic product (GDP) reached CNY17,310.84, one of the highest among\nsubnational governments in the PRC. Its revenues of CNY131,551.51 million\nthat year amounted to roughly 13.4% of total local government revenue and\nits expenditures of CNY169,563.24 million made up about 9.8% of total\nlocal government expenditure\u2014the largest share in both cases.\n\n  The  finance  department  of  Guangdong  Province  initiated  and\ncoordinated the PPB initiative. In preparation, the department sent officials\nto Canada, France, the United Kingdom, and the US. It also secured support\nfrom key government and party officials, the local congress, and the Chinese\nPeople\u2019s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). Even though no formal\nlegislation was passed with respect to PBB, legislative support for the reform\nwas widespread and strong.\n\nTo promote the idea further among department officials, the finance\ndepartment  publishes  the  yearly  Guidelines  for  Expenditure  Performance\nEvaluation in Guangdong. In addition to updated regulations and guidelines\nfor  the  reform,  the  publication  contains  public  speeches  of  key  officials,\nincluding the president of the Guangdong Communist Party, the governor\nand vice governors, and the director of the finance department, to emphasize\nthe political significance of the PBB reform. The publication also includes\nexpert opinions from the central Ministry of Finance, the local congress, and\nthe Guangdong finance, audit, and supervision departments to demonstrate\nthe broad support behind the reform initiative.\n\nFurthermore, the department created a new division, the performance\nevaluation division (PED), chiefly to (i) compile and analyze financial statistics,\nand  (ii)  organize  and  conduct  the  performance  evaluation  of  provincial\nprograms. The PED has eight employees, three of whom are responsible for\nstatistical analysis. The other five employees are divided into two groups: one\nperson is in charge of basic performance evaluation, and the other four are in\ncharge  of  specified  or  focused  program  evaluation.  Basic  performance\nevaluation, also called self-evaluation, is the first stage of PBB evaluation. It is\nconducted by agencies with the help of guidelines from the finance department,\nand the results are submitted to PED (see self-evaluation form in the Appendix).\nOn the basis of the information it receives, PED organizes and conducts focused\nprogram evaluation to examine selected programs and agencies.5\n\n5 The focused evaluation is done by public officials from the finance department and experts in related\nissues  and  topics. The  finance  department  is  responsible  for  maintaining  an  expert  inventory  of\nscholars, public officials, and agents, whose opinions may be solicited for focused program evaluation.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n416\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fPerformance-Based Budgeting in China: A Case Study of Guangdong\n\n417\n\nOverview of PBB Implementation\n\nIn the first year, the finance department launched six pilot projects in\nperformance  evaluation  (see  table). The  selection  of  these  programs  was  a\ntop-down,  centralized  decision  by  the  finance  department.6 The  programs\nthat were chosen were those that (i) drew the attention of the party president\nor the governor; (ii) were believed to have the capacity to implement PBB;\n(iii)  had  a  large  appropriation  and  fiscal  significance;7  or  (iv)  were  under\nagencies with strong incentives to support PBB. Most of these programs were\nalso included in the long-term strategic plan of Guangdong Province and had\nrelatively  well-defined  program  goals  and  performance  targets.  Only  the\ntourism  department,  among  the  agencies  in  the  experiment,  had  had  a\nperformance  evaluation  program,  a  year  before  the  PBB  experiment. This\ndepartment is discussed in greater detail later on in this paper.\n\nPBB Pilot Projects in Guangdong, 2003\n\nPilot Program\n\nResponsible Agency\n\nScience and Technology Park for\n\nScience and Technology Department\n\nReconstruction of Elementary Schools\n\nAccelerating Commission for Development\n\nPrivate Enterprises\n\nfor Mountainous and Old\nAreas in 16 Cities\n\nHighroad Construction for 16 Poor Areas\nBasic Construction for Universities\nin the Tenth Five-Year Plan\nAsset Reorganizations of Commercial\n\nand Enterprises Group\n\nof Revolution and Old Areas;\nEducation Department\n\nTransportation Department; Road Department\nEducation Department\n\nCommercial and Enterprises Group\n\nSupporting Poor Areas with Tourism\n\nTourism Department\n\nDevelopment\n\nSource: Finance Department of Guangdong, 2004.\n\nAfter selecting the six pilot projects, the finance department notified the\nresponsible agencies. It also organized a working committee, chaired by the\ndirector  of  the  finance  department  and  having  members  drawn  from  the\ndifferent divisions of the department, to guide PED in performance evaluation.\nThe working committee then designed a self-evaluation form for the\npilot programs. After the forms had been accomplished and sent back to PED,\n\n6\n\nSince 2004, all long-term programs (more than 5 years) and programs with a budget of more than\nCNY5 million have had to carry out performance evaluation.\n\n7 The Highroad Construction Program for 16 Poor Areas, for example, received annual funding of\n\nCNY250 million.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n417\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f418\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nthe performance review process began. It consisted of four major steps. First,\nPED checked for information completion and data errors in the basic data\nreview. Second, the division conducted fieldwork evaluation and site visits,\nand  asked  program  managers  and  agency  officials  to  present  performance\ninformation and respond to questions from PED and its group of experts\nabout the programs. Third, PED analyzed the data and site visit information\nand  produced  performance  reports. The  final  step  was  to  disseminate  the\nresults. An early draft of the evaluation report was circulated among the relevant\nexpert groups and agencies for feedback. On the basis of the feedback, PED\nrevised the report and sent the final results to the responsible agencies and\nother relevant organizations and individual officials.\n\nTwo Case Studies\n\nTo better understand the challenges and accomplishments of the PBB\npilot project, PED conducted site visits in the fall of 2005 and held interviews\nwith budget officials and staff of the Guangdong finance department and two\nof the departments that were included in the pilot implementation, namely,\nthe tourism and transportation departments.8 The tourism department was\nchosen because it had the longest history of performance measurement among\nthe six pilot programs and was highly supportive of PBB. It was also a functional\nagency with relatively more autonomous authority in its daily operation and\nmanagement. The transportation department, on the other hand, was new to\nthe idea of PBB and did not volunteer to participate in the pilot phase. Because\nof these differences in background, capacity, and attitude toward PBB, the\nfollowing case studies should provide an interesting comparison that highlights\nsome of the daunting challenges and barriers to implementing PBB.\n\nA Case Study of the Guangdong Tourism Department. The tourism\ndepartment began to conduct program performance evaluation in 2002, a\nyear before the PBB pilot project. The department evaluated 14 programs in\n2002  and  35  in  2003.  One  of  its  programs,  Supporting  Poor  Areas  with\nTourism Development, was selected by the finance department for the PBB\nexperiment. The program has an annual budget of about CNY30 million.\n\nBecause  the  tourism  department  has  had  an  internal  history  of\nperformance measurement, it has shown strong support for the idea of PPB\nand has been very proactive about it. The promotion of tourism development\nin poor areas is among its strategic goals (interviewee D). It has also arranged\n\n8 The following were interviewed: two budget officials of the PED (interviewees A and B), a budget\nanalyst of the PED (interviewee C), a budget analyst of the tourism department (interviewee D),\nand a budget analyst of the transportation department (interviewee E).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n418\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fPerformance-Based Budgeting in China: A Case Study of Guangdong\n\n419\n\nfor representatives of the local congress and CPPCC to visit these poor areas\nto  improve  their  understanding  of  the  importance  of  the  program  and  its\naccomplishments.\n\nThe tourism department created a working committee to assist in the\nimplementation of PBB. The deputy director of the department, who is also\nvice  president  of  the  branch  committee  of  the  communist  party  in  the\ndepartment, headed the committee. The committee members came from the\nvarious divisions of the department and represented different areas of expertise,\nsuch as natural resource extraction, tourism program management, and tourist\nmanagement.  In  addition,  the  department  developed  a  vertical  reporting\nstructure and required tourism departments at the city level to create their\nown working committees if they had tourist programs in poor areas. Mayors\noften headed these working committees, showing the political significance of\nthe performance evaluation.\n\nTo align its internal performance evaluation with the PBB pilot project\nat the finance department, the tourism department broke down the Supporting\nPoor Areas with Tourism Development program into subprograms, prepared\nfinancial plans for each subprogram, and submitted these plans with the budget\nrequest to the finance department. The PBB pilot project evaluated investment\nin public facilities such as restrooms and sidewalks, as well as security and\ntourist product development. But it did not review entertainment projects in\nscenic spots, because these projects are usually done with private investment\n(interviewee D).\n\nSince the National Tourism Bureau had not started any performance\nmeasurement reform, the Guangdong tourism department did not have much\nprior experience to draw from and had to rely on its own thinking and research\nto define and measure performance. The key performance measures collected\nand used by the department were: (i) number of tourists; (ii) increase in local\nemployment, hotels, and restaurants; (iii) increase in local resident income;\n(iv) amount of matching private investment; and (v) amount of matching\ninvestment from local governments. The department also determined whether\nscenic spots were open to the public (availability measure) and whether local\nresidents had started paying attention to protecting natural resources, and\nevaluated the quality of communication between residents and tourists.\n\nHowever, because of lack of experience and data, some of the measures\nwere still primitive and the data were not comprehensive. Also, no significant\nchange was made in the line-item budget structure to make it more oriented\ntoward  performance.  Interviewee  D  admitted  that  the  current  accounting\nsystem could not provide adequate information for financial analysis. Also,\nmost of the budget analysts and program managers of the department still\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n419\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f420\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nlacked the necessary experience and analytical capacity to define, measure,\nand analyze \u201cperformance.\u201d As a result, \u201cthe tourism department used mostly\nqualitative evaluation\u201d (interviewee D).\n\nDespite  these  limitations,  the  performance  measurement  effort  has\nstimulated  innovative  thinking  and  has  had  a  positive  effect  on  program\nmanagement. It has led to more discussion between the tourism department\nand  the  agriculture,  fishery,  and  forestry  industries  about  facilitating\ndevelopment  in  poor  mountainous  areas.  It  has  also  raised  policy  makers\u2019\nawareness of the need to improve highway and highroad development and to\ndevelop  long-term  economic  development  and  environmental  protection\nmeasures.9 Furthermore, budget analysts and program analysts were trained\nto use performance information more effectively. Although there were some\ncomplaints about the workload associated with the PBB program, departmental\nstaff were generally supportive (interviewee D). The management also helped\nin  reducing  staff  resistance  to  PBB  by  linking  program  performance  with\nemployees\u2019 performance evaluations and paying public compliments to high-\nperforming  employees.  Moreover,  well-performing  programs  were  offered\nfinancial incentives, such as continuous funding and easier budget approval.\nFinally,  PBB  has  contributed  to  a  cultural  shift  within  the  tourism\ndepartment. Public officials and program managers today have become more\naware of the importance of public accountability and pay closer attention to\nthe  results  of  public  spending.  PBB  has  also  raised  the  significance  of  the\nprogram within the department. The success is directly linked to the attitude\nof  the  top  leadership.  As  interviewee  D  commented,  \u201ctop  leaders\u2019\nacknowledgement is very important for PBB implementation. Many times in\npublic, they reiterated the importance of tourism development in supporting\npoor areas so that the voice of tourism could be heard and be taken seriously.\u201d\nA  Case  Study  of  the  Guangdong  Transportation  Department.  In\ncontrast to the experience of the tourism department, the PBB initiative at\nthe transportation department took a very different development path. First,\neven though one of its programs, Highroad Construction for 16 Poor Areas,\nwas selected as a PBB pilot project in 2003, the department itself did not start\nusing PBB until 2004. It also had limited capacity to handle performance\nmeasurement tasks and had to rely on the finance department to do most of\nthe data work for the pilot project in 2003.\n\n9 However,  interviewee  D  also  admitted  the  shortsightedness  of  tourism  development  policies:\n\u201cPrograms  cannot  be  too  long. Two  or  three  years  is  OK.  Otherwise,  private  investors  or  local\ngovernments would not like to invest.\u201d\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n420\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fPerformance-Based Budgeting in China: A Case Study of Guangdong\n\n421\n\n\u201cHighroad\u201d refers to the road system that connects highways and rural\nroads. Highroad construction is an important item in the Guangdong Province\nTenth Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005) for Supporting Poor Areas. According to\nthis  plan,  CNY250  million  would  be  invested  annually  in  highroad\nconstruction for 16 mountainous poor areas from 2001 to 2005, and by 2009,\nGuangdong  would  build  48,000  more  kilometers  of  highroad  to  meet\ntransportation demand in the province.\n\nThe  program  has  not  only  economic  but  also  political  significance.\nAccording to interviewee E, highways are built for public officials who like to\nget credit and national attention for their accomplishments. Rural roads, on\nthe other hand, are built for the public, especially in poor areas, to improve\nthe quality of life. Highroads, linking these two road systems, are critical to\npoliticians because they help realize the full potential benefits of both types of\ninfrastructure investment (interviewee E).\n\nHowever, the results of the first 2 years of spending on highroad programs\nin poor areas was not satisfactory, and this was probably one reason why the\nprogram  was  selected  as  a  PBB  pilot  project  by  the  finance  department\n(interviewee B). Since the transportation department itself had no previous\nexperience  with  performance  measurement  reform,  support  for  the  PBB\nexperiment was weak (interviewee E) and the pilot project was done only to\nsatisfy the demands of the finance department.\n\nFrom the beginning of the project, there were many technical hurdles to\novercome.  Since  there  was  no  unified  accounting  system  within  the\ntransportation department, it was almost impossible to provide all the details\nfor  program  evaluation  and  cost  analysis  (interviewee  E).  Performance\nmeasurement  in  the  department  was  further  complicated  by  the  fact  that\nmultiple providers and funders were involved. The department had more than\n30 programs, with a total budget of about CNY400 million. However, this\nwas just part of the financial picture, as the department often required matching\nfunds from local governments and private investors.10 Because external parties\nwere involved, the performance of the department in road construction was\nmore difficult to measure because it depended not only on the effort of the\nprovincial government but also on the cooperation of the external entities.\n\nThe transportation department was also highly constrained in staffing\nthe  management  of  performance  measurement  tasks.  Its  financial  division\nhad nine employees: the director, the deputy director, the internal auditor, the\ncashier, three internal accountants, an accountant responsible for managing\n\n10 One  of  the  performance  measures  in  the  PBB  pilot  project  was  whether  the  department  had\n\nsuccessfully secured matching funds for projects.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n421\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f422\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nbusiness with the central Government, and, finally, an accountant responsible\nfor managing business with the provincial government. All of them were already\nheavily occupied and could not commit much time to performance evaluation.\nSince individual departments had no fiscal or administrative authority to add and\nhire for new positions, the problem could not be resolved easily (interviewee E).\nIn addition, because of the diversity of its programs, the department\nfound it difficult to define the goals of the programs and develop reliable and\nvalid measures for program evaluation. For example, determining how the\neffectiveness of environment protection or the social benefits of building a\nnew road should be defined and measured was a serious challenge. As a result,\nthe  department  kept  track  of  only  very  simple  performance  data,  such  as\nwhether roads were open or closed. It also relied mostly on qualitative analysis\nin the evaluation process. As interviewee E remarked, the department could\nfocus only on very raw performance measures and its ultimate goal was to\nensure that people could have efficient access to roads for basic daily needs\nand emergency purposes.\n\nThis is not to say that there was no benefit from the PBB pilot project. It\nis believed to have contributed to better strategic planning and helped shift\nthe  budgeting  focus  from  input  to  results  of  programs.  However,  with  its\nhighly  constrained  staff  and  administrative  capacity,  the  transportation\ndepartment was not enthusiastic about the PPB pilot project. In reviewing\nthe situation, interviewee E agreed that the involvement of a third party, such\nas a private agent funded by the finance department, might have helped the\nsituation  and  increased  the  financial  transparency  of  the  transportation\ndepartment.  Also,  the  department  needed  more  incentives  to  encourage\nvoluntary cooperation. Interviewee E remarked:\n\nThe finance department is responsible for developing an incentive system\nto increase agencies\u2019 initiatives to implement PBB. For example, the finance\ndepartment can simplify the budgetary request process for agencies that\nhave  better  performance. This  will  help  reduce  the  workload  of  these\nagencies. In addition, the finance department can publicize the PPB results\nand give nonfinancial acknowledgment to agencies that implement PBB\nwell.  This  will  further  motivate  not  only  agencies  that  have  good\nperformance  but  also  agencies  that  have  poor  performance.  Financial\nincentives could work, but if more resources were given to programs with\nbetter performance and less resources to poorly performing programs, this\nmay  contradict  the  principle  of  fiscal  administration  and  reduce  the\nefficiency of budget allocation.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n422\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fPerformance-Based Budgeting in China: A Case Study of Guangdong\n\n423\n\nLessons from the Guangdong PBB Experience\n\nAccomplishments\n\nThe review of the pilot projects showed that Guangdong Province had\nto, and will need to, surmount many hurdles in implementing PBB. However,\nthe province should be complimented for its progress so far and its realistic\napproach to implementation. The Guangdong experience, when compared\nwith the decades-long experience in Western countries, confirms the fact that\nthe success of PBB reforms depends on several critical factors.\n\nSecuring top leaders\u2019 support is important. Like the Western experiences,\nthe Guangdong case study shows that strong commitment and support from\nthe top leadership is a key to the successful implementation of PBB. From the\nvery beginning of the reform, the finance department carefully secured political\nsupport for reform. The finance director introduced PBB to the president of\nthe  communist  party  in  Guangdong,  Dejiang  Zhang,  and  to  Guangdong\nGovernor Hua Huang and received their full support. Careful selection of the\nsix pilot projects and the ability to demonstrate accomplishments to top leaders\nhelped  the  projects  win  further  political  support.  President  Zhang\ncomplimented the department thus: \u201cThe [Guangdong] finance department\nhas  done  a  great  job  in  the  performance  evaluation  of  the  Science  and\nTechnology  Park  for  Private  Enterprises  program.  I  recommend  that  the\ndepartment  draw  lessons  for  others  from  this  pilot\u201d  (Guangdong  Finance\nDepartment 2005, page 2).\n\nPatience is necessary; the reform must be given time to evolve. The\nWestern  experiences  show  that  PBB  reform  may  take  decades  of\nexperimentation to evolve and succeed. Therefore, the Guangdong reformers\nset a modest goal at the early stage of the reform: to \u201cenhance understanding\nof performance evaluation.\u201d11 They did not expect to make drastic changes in\nthe system. Instead, they focused on learning, education, experimentation,\nand  information  dissemination  to  help  officials  understand  better  the\nimportance of PBB. As interviewee A said, \u201cWe will not introduce PBB in all\nagencies until people have very good understanding of PBB. The challenges\nin PBB implementation in Guangdong are more political than technical.\u201d\n\nFocusing on the cultural shift is important. Guangdong officials realized\nthat even though many technical and administrative conditions were not fully\nready  for  a  comprehensive  PBB  reform,  they  could  start  working  on  the\nnecessary  cultural  shift  and  create  a  different  managerial  mentality  in  the\n\n11 This is the first principle of Guangdong\u2019s PBB, published in Guidelines for Performance Evaluation\n\n(2005) (Guangdong Finance Department 2005, page 227).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n423\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f424\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nbureaucracy. They wanted all provincial officials to understand that PBB was a\nnecessary and inevitable step in reform. \u201cWe must show results where we spend\nmoney\u201d (interviewee B). They also wanted to make sure that all budget officials\nin the finance department understood the importance of PBB as the driving\nforce for the result-oriented reform in the future (interviewees A and E).\n\nFuture Challenges\n\nDespite these accomplishments, tremendous hurdles still confront the\n\nGuangdong finance department. These challenges include the following.\n\nHow to define \u201cperformance.\u201d The first technical challenge is how to\ndefine \u201cperformance\u201d for different departments. The finance department needs\nto  develop  an  inventory  or  a  knowledge  base  of  performance  measures,\nquantitative as well as qualitative, for different departments. This is especially\nimportant at the early stage of reform, when many departments lack experience\nand  understanding  of  which  measures  are  appropriate,  reliable,  and\nquantifiable.\n\nHow  to  benchmark  \u201cperformance.\u201d  After  performance  measures  are\ndefined,  the  finance  department  and  program  analysts  in  the  different\ndepartments still need to know whether performance is acceptable or not.\nCurrently, there is no benchmark for the PBB pilot projects. As a result, PED\nhas had difficulty evaluating and analyzing their performance.\n\nHow  to  expand  the  pool  of  expertise  in  performance  evaluation.\nCurrently,  the  finance  department  is  the  primary  source  of  expertise  in\nperformance measurement and budgeting, and within the department, PED\nspecializes  in  performance  evaluation.  However,  PED  originated  from  the\nstatistics and evaluation division, which primarily evaluates state-owned assets,\nnot programs. Hence, if PBB is to cover more programs and agencies, the\nfinance department will have to provide more training and staff development\nto reorient its analysts. In addition, it may need to rely on external experts in\nrelated fields. Unfortunately, the progress in establishing an expert inventory\nhas  remained  unsatisfactory. This  may  create  a  bottleneck  for  the  future\nexpansion of PBB reform in Guangdong.\n\nNeed for complementary personnel reforms to support PBB. As the\nWestern experiences have shown, PBB is an intensive data exercise and demands\nmuch time and resources from departments. The special software programs\ncreated by PED to reduce the reporting workload of departments have helped\nonly the basic data exchange between agencies and the finance department.\nTime and people are still needed to collect and analyze data. Unfortunately,\nhiring decisions are outside the control of the functional departments and the\nfinance  department  and  are  in  the  hands  of  the  Staff  Administration\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n424\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fPerformance-Based Budgeting in China: A Case Study of Guangdong\n\n425\n\nCommission (interviewee B). If the commission fails to recognize the mounting\nhiring needs of the finance department and other agencies, this will only create\nmore work stress among staff and ultimately resistance to reform.\n\nNeed to create stronger departmental support for PBB. The case studies\nabove  show  that  the  different  departments  have  varying  degrees  of\nunderstanding and support for PBB. The finance department apparently has\nthe strongest support and motivation to implement the reform. The tourism\ndepartment also got solid support for PBB from its director, the party president,\nand  the  governor. The  transportation  department,  however,  has  been  less\nenthusiastic about the reform. Diverse opinions about PBB can be expected.\nHowever,  if  not  managed  carefully,  those  opinions  may  create  significant\npolitical roadblocks in the way of reform.\n\nNeed for accounting and financial management reforms. The current\nfocus of the Guangdong PBB reform is on performance measurement and\nprogram evaluation. Not much has been done to link performance information\nto cost information and budgetary requests, which are the focus of PBB reform\nin  Western  countries  today. To  fully  link  budgeting  and  performance\nmeasurement  will  require  major  reforms  in  the  accounting  system  of  the\nGovernment to improve the cost analysis of programs. However, the Ministry\nof Finance at the national level, and not the provincial finance departments,\nmanages government accounts. Hence, how the accounting system reforms\ncan be accomplished remains a puzzling intergovernmental question.\n\nIn  addition,  the  current  PBB  reform  in  Guangdong  focuses  only  on\nindividual  programs  without  considering  the  full  operation  and  personnel\ncosts of an agency, and hence does not give a full cost picture of programs.\nUnder the current budgeting structure, budget expenditures are divided into\nthree major categories: personnel expenditures, operation expenditures, and\nprogram  expenditures.  \u201cPersonnel  expenditures\u201d  are  payments  made  to\nagencies\u2019 employees, including basic salary, allowances, subsidies, social security\nand retirement benefits, education stipends, health insurance, and housing\nsubsidies. \u201cOperation expenditures\u201d are amounts spent on daily operations,\nsuch as business travel, supplies, maintenance and repairs, reception, and other\nbusiness-related  spending.  \u201cProgram  expenditures\u201d  go  to  the  repair  and\npurchase of large facilities, basic construction, renovation, and the provision\nof products and services. If future PBB reform is to include other expenditures\nin the analysis, significant changes in the accounting and budgeting system\nwill be needed.\n\nIssues of power distribution between the finance department and the\nbudget offices of functional departments. The finance department currently\nplays  a  significant  role  in  initiating  and  coordinating  the  PBB  reform  in\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n425\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\f426\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nGuangdong. But it has to work closely with the executive budget offices within\nthe functional agencies, which are responsible for financial management and\nbudgeting at the agency level. Because of lack of understanding of PBB and\nmiscommunication between the finance department and these budget agencies,\nhowever, agencies sometimes fail to meet the reporting requirements set by\nthe finance department. Some agencies also play \u201cword games\u201d with the finance\ndepartment and fail to submit the necessary information. How the power\nstructure between agencies\u2019 budget offices and the finance department should\nbe reshaped in the future is another major challenge and may create political\nhurdles for PBB reform.\n\nRealignment  of  responsibilities  between  divisions  in  the  finance\ndepartment.  As  mentioned  above,  PED  is  a  new  division  in  the  finance\ndepartment,  with  responsibility  for  performance  evaluation  and  PBB\nimplementation. However, other functional divisions in the finance department\nmonitor  departmental  budgets.  How  PED  should  coordinate  with  these\ndivisions has remained a challenge (interviewee B). Before the implementation\nof PBB, these functional divisions were authorized to review budget requests\nfrom agencies and provide suggestions. Under PBB, after division review, all\nprogram budgets must be sent to PED for performance evaluation. This can\nsometimes be regarded as a challenge to the authority of functional divisions\nand  can  create  political  resistance  to  the  reform. The  problem  is  further\ncomplicated when PED is short of expertise in specific fields and when agencies\ncomplain  that  PED  guidelines  are  unhelpful  or  are  misinformed. These\nproblems may require more careful examination of the administrative structure\nof the Guangdong finance department, which may need to evolve toward the\nmodel  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budgeting  of  the  US  federal\nGovernment.\n\nDifficulties  in  aligning  strategic  planning  and  performance\nmeasurement.  As  shown  in  the  Western  countries\u2019  experiences,  strategic\nplanning is an essential element of PBB. Program objectives should be the\nbasis for developing performance measures, and performance measurement\nshould be used to evaluate whether program goals have been met. Ideally,\nprogram  goals,  objectives,  and  performance  measures  should  be  aligned.\nHowever, the institutional setting in the PRC may not allow this to happen\neasily. First, strategic planning is a top-down process. Public polices and goals\nare  often  set  by  the  central  and  provincial  governments,  and  departments\nhave little flexibility in establishing their own strategic goals and performance\ntargets. Even if a program is found to be ineffective and inefficient, a department\nmay  still  need  to  continue  its  operation  if  the  program  is  mandated  by  a\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n426\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fPerformance-Based Budgeting in China: A Case Study of Guangdong\n\n427\n\nhigher level of government. Situations like this may frustrate program managers\nand performance analysts who believe that PBB is meaningless and futile.\n\nPerformance incentives. As in the Western experience, the creation of\npositive incentives is critical in encouraging compliance and support for PBB\nreforms. In the current PBB system, there is no formal incentive policy to\nreward  high-performing  agencies  or  punish  poorly  performing  programs.\nHowever, according to interviewee B, the finance department has informal\nrules for giving agencies incentives to perform. It tends to give higher priority\nto  the  budget  requests  and  concerns  of  programs  and  agencies  that  have\nperformed well in previous years. \u201cThis does not mean that programs that\nwere not done well will get budget cuts,\u201d said interviewee B. \u201cBudget allocation\nshould  serve  public  policy  and  strategic  plans,  but  we  have  considered\naccommodating agencies that have done a very good job.\u201d Under this strategy,\n\u201cthe better the agencies spend their budget, the easier it is for them to have the\nnext year\u2019s budget approved\u201d (interviewee E). These rules seem to be reasonable\nand are highly consistent with the PBB practices in many Western countries.\nIn the future, the finance department might formalize these rules and make\nthem  more  transparent  to  program  and  agency  managers  so  that  they  can\nrespond positively to the PBB reform. Also, they might extend the incentive\nsystem to personnel management and reward managers that help organizations\nbecome more effective and efficient.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis  paper  analyzes  the  recent  PBB  reform  in  Guangdong  Province,\nPRC.  Our  analysis  shows  that  reformers  in  Guangdong  face  technical,\nadministrative, and political challenges that are very similar to those in other\ncountries. The common core questions seem to be how \u201cperformance\u201d should\nbe defined and measured, how performance information should be aligned\nwith  budgeting  and  strategic  planning,  and  how  the  reform  should  be\nimplemented within a political system.\n\n Our analysis also implies that the future success of the Guangdong reform\nwill depend not only on the improvement of its administrative and technical\ncapacity, but also on the political will of the leadership to tackle some sensitive\nquestions, such as the role of the finance department and its relationship with\nfunctional departments, the power distribution between divisions of the budget\noffice, intergovernmental relations, and the responsibilities of the executive\nand the legislative branches. In the PRC, the role of the Communist Party in\nthe budgetary process and in other governmental decision making is also a\nfundamental issue that deserves special attention.

It\nalso challenges policy makers and reformers to rethink some of the fundamental\nquestions of governance, such as who should have what power in the decision-\nmaking process, and when they should be granted the power. Perhaps one\nreason why PBB reforms in many Western countries often took decades to\nevolve is that the answers to some of these questions are not easily resolved. If\nany lesson can be drawn from the Western experience with PBB, it would be\nthe prediction that the reform by Guangdong is just the beginning of a long\njourney that may take decades to complete.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-1.pmd\n\n428\n\n20/11/2006, 3:15 PM\n\n\fPerformance-Based Budgeting in China: A Case Study of Guangdong\n\n429\n\nReferences\n\nBarrett, Katherine, and Richard Greene. 2002.

D. Pathak1\n\nR. S. Prasad2\n\nIntroduction\n\nCorruption is a complex phenomenon. A vast literature is dedicated to\ndefining the term. This paper defines corruption as the \u201cuse of public office\nfor  private  gains\u201d  (Bardhan  1997).  A  similar  definition  is  given  by  Rose-\nAckerman  (1999,  page  3),  who  describes  corruption  as  a  symptom  that\nsomething  has  gone  wrong  in  the  management  of  the  state.  Institutions\ndesigned to govern the interrelationships between the citizen and the state are\nused  instead  for  personal  enrichment  and  the  provision  of  benefits  to  the\ncorrupt. The price mechanism, so often a source of economic efficiency and a\ncontributor to growth, in the form of bribery, undermines the legitimacy and\neffectiveness of government.\n\nThe work of Rose-Ackerman (1978, 1994) and Klitgaard (1995a, 1995b)\nis  especially  pertinent  here.  Professor  Klitgaard\u2019s  and  Rose-Ackerman\u2019s\ncorruption framework is succinctly summarized in the following equation:\n\nCorruption = Monopoly + Discretion - Transparency (in governance)\n\nCorruption reflects poor governance and erodes the moral fiber of society\n(TII and CMS 2005). Corruption is anti-poor: the poor, the downtrodden,\nand the underprivileged are its worst victims. Corruption in any form affects\nsocietal harmony and all the institutions of civilized society. It affects human\ndignity, freedom of speech, equity, equal opportunities, social development,\nprompt redress of grievances and injustice, uniform distribution of wealth,\nrule of law, transparency, and accountability in governance. To create a more\nharmonious society, corruption must be eliminated or reduced.\n\nE-governance, on the other hand, is defined as the use of information\nand  communication  technology  (ICT)  to  bring  about  simple,  moral,\n\n1\n\n2\n\nProfessor and Head, Department of Management and Public Administration, School of Social and\nEconomic Development, The University of the South Pacific, Suva, Fiji Islands.\n\nFaculty  Member  and  Head,  IT  Department,  Institute  of  Chartered  Financial  Analysts  of  India\n(ICFAI) Business School, ICFAI University, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n434\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fRole of E-Governance in Tackling Corruption: The Indian Experience\n\n435\n\naccountable, responsive, and transparent (SMART) governance (Budhiraja\n2003,  Rajashekar  2002,  Heeks  2001,  Harris  2004).  The  objective  of\ne-governance is to support and simplify governance for the community of\ncitizens, civil society organizations, private companies, government lawmakers,\nand regulators (Tapscott and Agnew 1999). E-governance includes citizen-\nto-government (C2G), government-to-citizen (G2C), business-to-government\n(B2G),  government-to-business  (G2B),  and  government-to-government\n(G2G) transactions.\n\nIndia is one of the few countries that have taken up projects to harness\nthe potential of ICT for better governance. Different e-governance projects in\nIndia have had different objectives. Many of these projects have been very\nsuccessful, whereas others have not been as successful and some projects have\nfailed to achieve the objectives. But all the projects have succeeded in reducing\ncorruption to some extent.\n\nThis study examines the relationship between successful e-governance\nand reduced corruption by analyzing some successful e-governance initiatives\nin India.\n\nCorruption in India\n\nAfter gaining independence, India opted for a parliamentary democracy.\nDemocracy was supposed to bring good governance. But, though India has\nproved to be a stable democracy, it has not had good governance. The most\nimportant reason for this is pervasive corruption. Former Prime Minister Rajiv\nGandhi observed that for each rupee spent on antipoverty programs only 15\npaise reached the beneficiary: 40 paise was spent on overhead and 45 paise\nwas lost to corruption.\n\nIndia ranked 92nd among 159 countries in the Corruption Perception\nIndex of Transparency International (TI) for 2005. On a range of 0 (highly\ncorrupt) to 10 (very clean), India\u2019s score was a poor 2.9. India ranked 72nd in\nthe 2001 version of the index, 73rd in 2002, 83rd in 2003, and 91st in 2004.\nIn other words, corruption in the country is perceived to be increasing from\nyear to year. It is no consolation that all the other countries in South Asia also\nrank poorly.\n\nIn the India Corruption Study 2005, Transparency International India\n(TII) studied the corruption that common citizens face daily in 11 public\nservices in 20 major states of India. The public services were grouped into\n(i) need-based services, comprising income tax, municipalities, judiciary, land\nadministration, police, and rural financial institutions; and (ii) basic services,\ncomprising schools, water supply, public distribution system, electricity, and\ngovernment hospitals. Corruption was found to be greater among need-based\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n435\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f436\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nservices. According to the study, to avail themselves of the 11 public services,\ncitizens had paid bribes totaling Rs210.6 billion ($4.57 billion) in 2004. The\nmost disturbing finding of the study was that even the judiciary is plagued by\ncorruption. Sam Piroj Bharucha, former chief justice of the Supreme Court,\nsaid that up to 20% of all judges in India are corrupt. TII\u2019s study put the value\nof corruption in the judiciary at Rs26.3 billion ($0.5 billion) yearly. The study\nalso reported that three fourths of the citizens feel that corruption is increasing\n(TII and CMS 2005).\n\nThe study did not include political and business-related corruption or\ngrand larceny, where billions of rupees are paid as bribes or siphoned off. If\nthose figures were to be included, the magnitude of corruption in India would\nbe mind-boggling. According to TI (2004), in government procurement alone,\n$400 billion a year is lost to bribery worldwide. The loss due to all forms of\ncorruption could well run into trillions of dollars yearly. India contributes a\nmajor chunk as one of the world\u2019s largest economies\u2014and also one of the\nmost corrupt.\n\nTypes of Corruption in India and Contributing Factors\n\nBhatnagar  (2003c)  differentiates  between  administrative  corruption,\ncollusion,  and  extortion.  Administrative  corruption  involves  delaying  or\ndenying service until a bribe is paid. Collusion, where both parties gain at the\nexpense of government, involves favors, lowered taxes, waived penalties, and\ntampered government records. Extortion involves unreasonable demands by\nlaw enforcement authorities or tax collectors to extract bribes. Corruption in\nIndia  can  be  classified  into  petty  bureaucratic  corruption  at  lower  levels,\nadministrative  corruption  involving  senior  public  servants,  and  political\ncorruption. Common corrupt practices are kickbacks, bribes, nepotism and\nmisuse of office, misuse and abuse of public funds, unfair decisions in public\nprocurement, and unethical and unfair award of contracts for personal gain.\nThe factors contributing to corruption are many: political patronage,\npolitician-bureaucrat connections, politician-police-criminal connections, lack\nof  transparency  in  government  and  bureaucratic  functioning,  lack  of\naccountability, complex administrative procedures, discretionary powers of\nexecutive  and  administrative  authorities,  absence  of  effective  corruption\nreporting mechanisms, lack of deterrents, poor conviction rates of the corrupt,\ncorrupt judiciary, poor economic policies, black money, inadequate training\nof officials. Unfortunately, Indian society seems to have accepted corruption\nas a way of life, and the cost of being corrupt in India today is much less than\nthe cost of not being corrupt (Sondhi 2000, Vittal 2004).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n436\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fRole of E-Governance in Tackling Corruption: The Indian Experience\n\n437\n\nEffects of Corruption\n\nThe Supreme Court of India has compared corruption to cancer, plague,\nHIV/AIDS, and also royal thievery. On the effects of corruption, the honorable\ncourt said (AIR 2000):\n\nThe socio-political system exposed to such a dreaded communicable disease\nis  likely  to  crumble  under  its  own  weight.  Corruption  is  opposed  to\ndemocracy and social order, being not only anti people, but also aimed\nand  targeted  at  them.  It  affects  the  economy  and  destroys  the  cultural\nheritage.  Unless  nipped  in  the  bud  at  the  earliest,  it  is  likely  to  cause\nturbulence shaking of [the] socioeconomic political system in an otherwise\nhealthy, wealthy, effective and vibrant society.\n\nAccording to Peter Eigen, TI chairman, \u201ccorruption is a major cause of\npoverty as well as a barrier to overcoming it\u201d (TI 2005). Corruption makes\npublic investment more expensive, reduces government income and its capacity\nfor investment, retards the country\u2019s growth potential and the growth of its\ngross domestic product, results in poor public infrastructure, shifts investments\nfrom priority sectors (socially important areas) like education or health and\nsocial  welfare  projects  for  the  underprivileged  sectors  of  society  to  large\ninvestments with the capacity to provide illegal earnings like defense purchases.\nCorruption restricts the access of citizens to public services they are supposed\nto get freely, generates black money, which in turn generates corruption, and\nincreases the rich-poor divide. The costs of corruption to the country also\ninclude personal losses, loss of time, development cost, political cost, decline\nin the work ethic and degradation of values, and cost to the economy (TI\n2001b). Politically, corruption increases injustice and disregard for the rule of\nlaw  (Sondhi  2000).  Corruption  also  affects  foreign  direct  investment  and\nforeign aid. Among the factors that contribute to poverty and its persistence,\ncorruption is the most significant. Everyone suffers because of corruption,\nbut  the  poor  and  developing  countries,  and  the  poorest  people  in  these\ncountries, suffer the most. Corruption keeps the society, the government, and\nthe  economy  underdeveloped,  in  the  process  creating  social  tensions  and\ndisharmony.\n\nCombating Corruption with E-Governance\n\nN. Vittal, India\u2019s former chief vigilance commissioner, suggested a three-\npoint  formula  for  combating  corruption:  simplified  rules  and  procedures,\ngreater transparency and empowerment of the public, and effective punishment\nfor the corrupt (Vittal 2004). In an opinion poll by Cho and Choi (2004),\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n437\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f438\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\n84.3% of the respondents said that the OPEN system (for \u201conline procedures\nenhancement\u201d)  for  civil  applications,  set  up  by  the  Seoul  metropolitan\ngovernment  to  fight  corruption,  had  made  the  city  administration  more\ntransparent, and 72.3% said that they were happy with the administration.\nAnother survey by Fuliya and Bansal (2005) showed that providing a wide\nrange of citizen-friendly services in one place through e-governance did away\nwith middlemen, reduced corruption, and improved service delivery.\n\nICT offers benefits not found in conventional information management\nsystems that make these reforms possible. As Colby (2001), Chaurasia (2003),\nBudhiraja  (2003),  and  Millard  (2004)  point  out,  ICT  allows  greater\naccessibility, wider reach, instant communication and spread of information,\nautomatic record keeping, systematic classification and recovery of data, better\nknowledge management, and sharing of information. Those responsible for\nparticular decisions or activities are readily identified and administrative actions\nare more transparent. These characteristics can transform public administration\nand the relations between government and citizens, and make ICT a powerful\ntool in combating corruption in public administration.\n\nAccording  to  Bhatnagar  (2003b,  2005),  e-governance  introduces\ntransparency in the data, decisions, actions, rules, procedures, and performance\nof government agencies. It simplifies processes and rules, takes away discretion\nby automating processes, builds accountability, introduces competition among\ndelivery channels, standardizes documentation for more effective supervision,\ncentralizes and integrates data for better audit and analysis. Citizens no longer\nhave to bribe officials because the chances of exposure are high. The result is\ngreater civic engagement and less corruption, leading to good governance.\n\nE-governance upholds honesty and integrity in public administration,\nYisheng  (2002)  puts  in,  adding  that  e-governance,  in  helping  to  prevent\ncorruption, helps to promote democracy and the rule of law.\n\n\u201cTransaction governance capacity\u201d can thus be created, Prahalad (2005)\nsays.  The  citizens  are  empowered,  no  longer  information-poor,  able  to\nparticipate, no longer obliged to wait in long queues for services that are their\ndue, and, above all, no longer exposed to the social and economic consequences\nof corruption.\n\n\u201c[In India] e-governance initiatives have begun to cut through the web\nof bureaucracy,\u201d notes Sing (2003). \u201cSome states in India have begun to provide\nservice delivery on line. And government web sites sometimes provide practical\ninformation on how to confront complaints about corrupt acts.\u201d A study of\n21 successful e-governance projects in India by Skoch consultancy services\n(Kochhar and Dhanjal 2004) brought out the marked decline in corruption\nas a result of the projects. According to the study report, 81% of the respondents\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n438\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fRole of E-Governance in Tackling Corruption: The Indian Experience\n\n439\n\nreported a reduction in corruption. The findings of that report are summarized\nin a table in the appendix.\n\nA survey of 4,500 citizens from five cities (Hyderabad, Delhi, Mumbai,\nKolkata [Calcutta], and Chennai) by the Center for Media Studies (Economic\nTimes,  19  January  2004)  showed  that  e-governance  has  brought  down\ncorruption in India. The study covered basic services, electricity, municipal\ncorporations, urban development, transport, civil supplies, hospitals, water\nsupply, and railways. Between 2000 and 2004, corruption went down from\n63% to 27% in Hyderabad, from 51% to 19% in Kolkata, and from 38% to\n18% in Chennai. But the level of corruption stayed about the same in Mumbai\nand even spurted from 40% to 49% in Delhi. The decline in corruption in\nHyderabad, Kolkata, and Chennai was attributed to the successful functioning\nof e-governance projects.\n\nE-Governance Projects leading to Reduced Corruption\n\nFor this study, we analyzed e-governance projects that, according to most\nstudies of egovernance projects (including Dataquest 2003, and Kochhar and\nDhanjal 2004), succeeded not only in achieving their stated primary objectives\nbut also in reducing corruption.\n\nBhoomi\n\nBhoomi, a G2C e-governance project in Karnataka, a state in southern\nIndia, is a noteworthy example of how ICT can help reduce the discretion of\nauthorities, improve accountability and transparency, and reduce corruption.\nFarmers in Karnataka who apply for a bank loan, verification, or a government\npension have to present land deeds\u2014known as records of rights, tenancy, and\ncrops  (RTCs).  Before  this  e-governance  project,  9,000  village  accountants\n(VAs) managed all the land records. These were not subject to scrutiny and\nthere was no accountability or transparency in providing the service. The VAs\nenjoyed  many  discretionary  powers.  Mostly  these  village  accountants  were\ninaccessible and they delayed or withheld the service until bribes were paid. It\nused to take 3 to 30 days to get an RTC, depending on the bribe paid. The\nbribes ranged from Rs100 to Rs2,500  ($2.1 to $52.1). Similarly, requests to\namend land records to reflect sale or inheritance first had to be verified by the\nVA, who then forwarded the applications to the revenue inspector for the\nchanges to be made. The process used to take up to 2 years, again depending\non the bribe paid. It was not uncommon for these officials to tamper with\ngovernment records to provide unfair advantages to people who paid bribes.\nVAs used to get bribes of around Rs10,000 ($220) for writing ambiguous\nreports.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n439\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f440\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nFor Bhoomi, the Karnataka government set up computerized land record\nkiosks (Bhoomi centers) in taluk (subdistrict) offices to provide the service to\nthe farmers. The Bhoomi project automated 20 million land records affecting\n6.7 million farmers. Now in less than 10 minutes and for only  Rs15 ($0.30)\na farmer can get a copy of an RTC online from any of the 180 computerized\nkiosks. A touch-screen facility allows easy access. Bhoomi has totally eliminated\nthe discretionary powers of officials by providing for online change requests.\nAccountability has been built in, as the kiosk operators have to provide the\nservice  within  a  given  time,  and  so  has  security  of  data,  transactions,  and\nprocedures. The operator of the system is accountable for decisions. Improved\naccountability has resulted from the deterrents imposed by the system: it tracks\nall database changes, documents all objections, gives the citizens easy access,\nand enables them to back their complaints with evidence.\n\nService is no longer delayed or withheld, as the transactions occur in a\npublic place and follow a simple first-in-first-out procedure, and the people are\nbecoming more aware that they do not have to pay bribes. According to an\nempirical assessment made in 2004 by the Public Affairs Center Bangalore under\nthe  World  Bank-funded  Governance  Knowledge  Sharing  Program,  78%  of\nsystem users found it easy to use and simple and 66% could use the kiosks\nwithout help. Seventy-nine percent did not have to meet any officials except the\nkiosk operator, whereas in the manual system 19% had to meet at least one\nofficial and 61% had to meet two to four officials. Errors in documents had\ngone  down  from  64%  to  8%.  Ninety-three  percent  of  users  who  received\ndocuments with errors sought to have them corrected, compared with 49% in\nthe manual system. The cost of service to the farmers had gone down considerably,\nas 84% of the users surveyed had to make only one visit to get the service. The\nimplementation of change requests had improved by 85%. The most important\nbenefit was that corruption had gone down from 66% to less than 3%. The\nBhoomi  project  has  saved  the  farmers  Rs806  ($17.5)  million  in  bribes  and\nRs66 mission ($1.43) in wages yearly (2002\u20132003) (Lobo and Balakrishnan\n2002, Narayan 2004, Bhatnagar  and Chawla 2001).\n\nComputer-aided Administration of Registration Department (CARD)\nCARD is a major success story of e-governance in Andhra Pradesh, one\nof the most IT-savvy states in India. The conventional procedure of registration\nwas cumbersome. It involved 13 steps, among them, ascertaining the value of\nthe property, calculating the stamp duty, writing the legal document, having\nit verified by a sub-registrar, copying the document, posting entries into the\nregister. Even a person selling a small piece of land had to go through stamp\nvendors,  document  writers,  registration  agents  (middlemen),  registration\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n440\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fRole of E-Governance in Tackling Corruption: The Indian Experience\n\n441\n\noffices,  and  other  agencies.  In  Andhra  Pradesh  the  387  registration  (sub-\nregistrar) offices were all loaded with work, as registrations ran into 120 million\ndocuments  a  year.  Each  step  and  each  person  in  the  process  caused  and\ncontributed to corruption. The entire process was shrouded in secrecy. The\nprocedures were very complex, rigid, and incomprehensible to ordinary citizens.\nThere was total lack of transparency in the evaluation of stamp duty, a major\nsource of revenue to the state government. Although guidelines were available,\nthe procedure gave much discretion to the officials and led to a considerable\namount of corruption. Dishonest citizens exploited this weakness by paying\nbribes.  Honest  citizens,  who  would  not  pay  bribes,  were  assessed  a  higher\nstamp  duty  or  had  to  endure  slow  service. There  was  no  accountability.\nOrdinary citizens had to seek the help of middlemen, who colluded with the\nofficials and served as conduits for bribes.\n\nThe  aim  of  the  CARD  project  was  to  purge  the  corruption-ridden\nregistration  system  by  demystifying  the  process,  introducing  transparent\nand easily understandable valuation, speeding up the process, and improving\nefficiency and the citizen interface with an electronic document writing and\ndocument  management  system. The  idea  of  automating  the  functioning\nwas  conceived  in  1988  but  met  with  little  success  at  the  time.  A  second\nstudy in 1996 led to a pilot project in September 1997, which had more\nsuccess  and  was  extended  to  212  registration  offices.  At  present,  CARD\noperates in 387 sub-registrar offices throughout Andhra Pradesh. The service\nlevels for various services have been established and prominently displayed\nin the offices. Registration now takes only 1 hour (instead of 1\u20137 days under\nthe old system), encumbrance certificates are issued in 10 minutes (instead\nof  1\u20135  days),  certified  copies  are  released  in  10  minutes  (instead  of  1\u20133\ndays).  Document  writing,  which  used  to  take  several  days,  can  now  be\ncompleted in 30 minutes, and valuation certificates, which used to take a\nwhole day to issue, can now be obtained in less than 10 minutes. Within 6\nmonths  of  operation,  80%  of  CARD  transactions  were  carried  out\nelectronically. CARD has brought transparency in property valuation, and\ncitizens themselves can calculate the duty. Officials are now responsible for\nproviding the service within the specified service levels. CARD has established\nthe accountability of officials and greatly reduced discretion. Now the system\nhandles on the average 5.7 million documents, 3.6 million encumbrance\ncertificates,  and  2  million  market  valuation  slips  annually.  The  most\nsignificant  achievement  of  CARD  has  been  eliminating  middlemen  and\norganized corruption. Corruption is down by 90%. In the absence of bribes,\nthe savings to the citizens amount to more than Rs1 billion and more revenue\ngoes to the treasury (Satyanarayana 2001).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n441\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f442\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nComputerized Interstate Checkpoints in Gujarat\n\nGujarat, a state in the western part of India, has an extensive road network.\nThe national highway links the Indian capital of Delhi with Ahmedabad and\nallows the passage of goods between the northern and western states. One of\nthe largest seaports, Kandla port, is in this state. For these reasons, there is\nheavy movement of vehicles carrying interstate goods on Gujarat highways. It\nis estimated that more than 25,000 interstate transport vehicles ply these roads\nevery day. More than 70% of these vehicles were found to be overloaded,\nposing grave danger to other road users. The truckers overloaded their trucks\nto earn more (and the manufacturers of goods avoided sales tax and central\nexcise duties), as the normal practice was to calculate weight or size by the\ntruckload.\n\nThe Gujarat government has 10 interstate checkpoints managed by road\ntransport officials of the Gujarat motor vehicles department, which controls\nroad transport activity in the state. The officials check whether the interstate\nvehicles  have  paid  the  required  road  taxes  or  not,  have  all  the  required\ndocuments (like insurance and permits), and are not overloaded. They can\nalso impose penalties for headlights that are broken or not working and for\nnonstandard license plates.\n\nThese checkpoints were notoriously corrupt. Officials were known to\npay  Rs10  million  ($0.21  million)  to  purchase  jobs  at  especially  lucrative\ncheckpoints. In 1999, out of 137 officials in the department, 27 were under\nsuspension for corrupt practices.\n\n  Under  the  old  system,  suspect  vehicles  had  to  wait  in  line  at  the\ncheckpoint. The average waiting time was 46.6 minutes. The official (inspector)\nexamined each vehicle and, if he wanted its accurate weight, he sent it to the\nnearest weigh bridge. After inspecting the documents, the inspector calculated\nthe penalty depending on the overload and issued a penalty notice. This process\ntook 22.4 minutes on the average. The driver paid the penalty and then drove\naway.  Documents  were  verified  manually  and  the  penalties  imposed  were\narbitrary and discretionary. The old system also had other shortcomings. Only\na few vehicles could be checked in a day, so that revenue was lost to the state.\nTruck drivers were normally held up for several hours and were forced to pay\nspeed money (bribes) to the officials. Collusion between the officials and truck\noperators was not rare; in fact, some officials were known to be on the payroll\nof large transport companies.\n\nTo speed up the service and to ensure full inspection, the government of\nGujarat implemented computerized interstate checkpoints. In this automated\nsystem, all vehicles were checked at the checkpoint, in the order they arrived.\nEach vehicle was weighed on an electronic weigh bridge, and the weight was\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n442\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fRole of E-Governance in Tackling Corruption: The Indian Experience\n\n443\n\nautomatically transmitted to the computer in the checkpoint office. At the\nsame time, the license plate was digitally scanned and the information was\nsent to a video server, where it was converted into text form. The weight and\nlicense  number  of  the  vehicle  were  transmitted  to  a  control  room  in\nAhmedabad, the state capital, over dedicated communication lines. At the\ncontrol room, the particulars of the vehicle and details like road tax payment\nwere checked with the help of license plate tracking software. If the vehicle\nwas not yet included in the system, the details were added to the database. If\ntaxes had not been paid, a message to that effect showed up on the computer\nscreen at the checkpoint. The permissible weight and actual weight were also\ndisplayed. The software computed the penalty automatically and a system-\ngenerated receipt was issued to the driver for the necessary payment. To ensure\ntransparency, all these details were also displayed on an electronic board outside\nthe  checkpoint  office  for  the  benefit  of  the  driver. The  driver  paid  with  a\nprepaid card and was required to make good any other aspect noted on the\ncomputer, like repairing broken headlights, before exiting the checkpoint, as\nonly then would the automated barrier let the vehicle through. The entire\nprocess now took only 2 minutes, despite the thorough check.\n\nCheckpoint officials could no longer be arbitrary or collude with erring\ntruck drivers. As a result, the annual income of the checkpoints quadrupled\nfrom Rs627.75 million ($13.6 million) to Rs2.6 billion ($0.05 billion). The\nincrease in revenue itself indicates how prevalent corrupt practices were in the\nsystem. A study team from the Center for E-Governance of the Indian Institute\nof Management (IIM)\u2013Ahmedabad conducted a survey on the effectiveness\nof the project 1 year after it was first implemented. According to the survey\nreport, revenues had gone up tenfold and the $4 million investment had been\nrecovered in just 6 months, increasing the revenue of the state. This project\nsucceeded  in  eliminating  corruption.  However,  it  was  later  abandoned  for\nreasons unrelated to the functioning or efficiency of the system. This project\nwas conceived in 1998 by a former transport commissioner of Gujarat state\nand implemented with support from the Gujarat government. Many road\ntransport officials saw the project as a threat. However, it was implemented\nsmoothly and ran well for a year, under the former commissioner. After his\ntransfer to another post after that year, monitoring mechanisms fell into disuse,\nmaintenance and service contracts were not renewed on various pretexts, and\nthe service provider therefore withdrew his people. This gave the road transport\nofficials the opportunity to misuse the system and revert to old practices (CEG-\nIIMA  2002,  UNDP-APDIP  2005).This  case  amply  demonstrates  how\nimportant it is for the project champion and the government to give sustained\nsupport to e-governance projects that root out corruption.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n443\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f444\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nSaukaryam\n\nLike  all  other  municipal  organizations  in  India,  the  Visakhapatnam\nMunicipal  Corporation  in  the  state  of  Andhra  Pradesh  was  known  for\ninefficiency, corruption, complicated procedures, and poor service. Even simple\nservices like getting a birth certificate or property tax assessment used to take\nseveral  days\u2014and  bribes  from  citizens.  Building  plan  approval  was  not\ntransparent, took an inordinate length of time, and bred corruption. Marked\nby  secrecy,  bids  and  tenders  for  public  works  and  procurement  by  the\nmunicipality were also traditional sources of corruption.\n\nSaukaryam  (\u201ccomfort  or  facility\u201d  in  the Telugu  language)  is  a  pilot\ne-governance project aimed at bringing transparent municipal services to the\ncitizen\u2019s doorstep. It is also the first project in the country that is based on\npublic-private participation in e-government. This project covers the whole\ngamut of online service provision. Citizens can access the Saukaryam through\nits Web site, through kiosks in civic centers, or through a network of banks.\nWith Saukaryam, citizens can check and pay their tax dues, apply for building\nplan approval and track the status of approval, get birth and death certificates\ninstantly, and register their complaints\u2014all online. They can also get redress\nof problems regarding taxation, water supply, and works management, as well\nas information about town planning and leases of municipal property online.\nHospitals can forward birth and death information online. With the Saukaryam\nproject,  the  Municipal  Corporation  has  started  publishing  all  information\nabout bids and auctions, tenders, and procurement decisions on its Web site.\nInterested parties can apply online and follow the progress online. The result\nof all this is transparency.\n\nAnother salient feature of the project is the citizen\u2019s charter, which lays\ndown  the  standards  of  service  to  citizens,  thus  ensuring  and  improving\naccountability. The rules and procedures are prominently displayed on the\nSaukaryam  Web  site.   The  utility-driven  site  serves  every  need  of  citizens\naround-the-clock and has done away with the need for a personal visit, which\nused to present an opportunity for corruption and harassment of citizens at\nthe hands of corrupt officials. This project also provides an online citizen\u2019s\nforum, where citizens can discuss problems and vent their grievances.\n\nEvery day more than 3,000 citizens use this facility, and the Web site has\nmore than 25,000 registered users. Services have improved many times over,\nin quality and speed, and corruption has largely been eliminated. This can be\nseen  from  the  increase  in  municipal  tax  collections.  The  Municipal\nCorporation, which had run up debits of  Rs350 million ($7.6 million), has\nearned  a  surplus  of  Rs1.0  billion  ($21.7  million)  since  the  project  was\nimplemented.

Customs\nused to be perceived as one of the most corrupt departments and was known\nfor slow service. Like any other government department, it had quite complex\nrules  and  procedures,  with  18  stages  of  processing  for  exports  and  15  for\nimports. The authorities had vast discretionary powers and no accountability.\nThe Government of India has introduced online functioning in all 23\ncustoms offices all over the country. The process has been reengineered and\nthe number of stages of processing has been reduced from 18 to 6 for imports\nand from 15 to 5 for exports. Digital signatures and payment gateways have\nbeen brought in. The e-filing of customs documents for imports and exports\nis in place and remote filing through an electronic gateway became functional\nin January 2004. Now 95% of all documents are filed online and 100,000\npeople visit the customs Web site daily to file papers or to check their status.\nOn 1 April 2005, the customs department started accepting the electronic\npayment of duties. Users can now pay through designated banks.\n\nVarious studies on the effectiveness of the new system have found it to\nbe simple, transparent, fast, and on the whole a great success. The reduction\nin corruption is estimated in billions of rupees. In the absence of detailed data\nit is difficult to quote exact figures. But there is ample evidence that online\nfunctioning has brought down corruption substantially, increased transparency\nin functioning, and improved services to the citizens (www.nasscom.org).\n\nVijayawada Online Information Center (VOICE)\n\nThe  Vijayawada  Online  Information  Center  (VOICE)  was  an\ne-governance  initiative  launched  in  1999  by  the  Vijayawada  Municipal\nCorporation. Municipal corporations are well known for corrupt practices\nand  Vijayawada  Municipal  Corporation  was  no  exception.  Citizens,  who\ndepended on it for services had to make a number of visits to the municipal\noffice and pay bribes. The speed of service depended entirely on the bribe\npaid.\n\nTo bring the services closer to the citizens, five kiosks connected to the\ncentral  server  were  opened  in  the  town,  eliminating  the  need  for  personal\nvisits by the citizens. Some information was also provided on a voice response\nsystem.

Rent for\nadvertising  space  was  calculated  automatically,  removing  discretion  and\nintroducing transparency. In just one year, 2002, the system issued 15,000\nbirth and death certificates, 2,100 building approvals, and 224,000 demand\nnotices  for  taxes.  Of  the  7,700  grievances  that  were  registered,  97%  were\nresolved. This project has reduced corruption, made services more accessible,\nand improved the finances of local governments (Kumar and Bhatnagar 2001,\nwww.worldbank.org, CMC Limited 2004, Government of Andhra Pradesh\n2005).\n\nKarnataka Valuation and E-Registration (KAVERI)\n\nKAVERI  is  a  Karnataka  government  e-governance  project  aimed  at\nspeeding up property registration and the delivery of documents to citizens\nthrough fully automated registration. The maladies of the registration system\nwere similar to those in Andhra Pradesh (CARD project): no transparency,\ncomplicated  procedure,  discretionary  powers,  presence  of  middlemen  and\ninsensitive officials. Corruption flourished. In addition to paying bribes, the\npeople found that the process also took a large toll of their time. Earlier attempts\nby government to improve the system through automation did not produce\nthe desired results. Various studies on the functioning of the old system clearly\nindicated that unless all the processes were reengineered, the project might\nnot  achieve  the  stated  aim.  Also,  large  amounts  of  funds  were  needed  to\nautomate 201 registration offices.\n\nThe government of Karnataka overcame this problem through public-\nprivate participation, whereby private parties run the front-end operations\n(interactions with citizens) through kiosks and the registration department\nhandles the back-end process. The private partners provide the hardware, office\nfurniture,  and  manpower  needed  for  front-end  operations  like  data  entry,\nscanning, and archiving. They are expected to recover their costs from the\nservice  fee  charged  to  the  users. The  registration  department  provides  the\nsoftware, completes the registration, and issues the certificates. The project\nbecame  fully  operational  in  2003  and  is  a  success.  A  survey  by  Skoch\nInternational in Bangalore found the project user-friendly, simple, and fast in\ndelivering  service.  A  major  finding  of  the  survey  was  that  corruption  had\ngone down by 80%. Respondents rated the reduction in corruption at 8 on a\nscale of 0 to 10 (Murthy, Mujibshiekh, and Patil 2002) (see Appendix).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n446\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fRole of E-Governance in Tackling Corruption: The Indian Experience\n\n447\n\nCentral Vigilance Commission (CVC) Web Site\n\nBy any standards, the CVC Web site is the most innovative experiment\nin  e-governance  by  a  government  department  with  the  responsibility  of\ncontrolling corruption in the government. CVC was made a statutory body\nin 1988 at the direction of the Supreme Court of India. Under the leadership\nof the then Commissioner N. Vittal, CVC had the idea of propagating zero\ntolerance of corruption. It launched a Web site to share information about\ncorruption with the general public. This Web site is unique in many aspects.\nIt gives information about the role, responsibilities, and strategies of CVC for\nfighting corruption. It guides the citizens on the procedure to be followed in\nlodging complaints without fear of reprisal. Other information on the Web\nsite includes a list of nominated officers from different departments who are\nresponsible  for  taking  the  complaints,  and  corruption  statistics. The  most\nimportant feature of the Web site is the published list of Indian Administrative\nService and revenue service officers who have been charged with corruption\nor punished.\n\nThe easy procedure of making complaints against corrupt government\nservants, and the likelihood that the names will be published on the Internet,\nhas  been  an  effective  deterrent  to  corruption. The  initiative  has  generated\nmuch resentment among senior officials but has been well received by the\npublic. A public survey by the Economic Times on the effectiveness of this\nexperiment showed that 83% of the respondents believed that naming the\nofficials charged with corruption would have a deterrent effect. In a separate\nstudy by the Hindustan Times, 90% of the respondents welcomed the move.\nSome officials tainted with corruption were found to be in sensitive posts,\nwhich they should not have been occupying in the first place. The Web site\nalso enables the mass media to transmit important information to the public,\noffsetting the problem of low computer and Internet density in India. The\nsite is undoubtedly a bold attempt to make information available to the general\npublic  and  discourage  corruption  (Bhatnagar  2003a,  Vittal  2004,\nwww.cvc.nic.in).\n\ne-Seva\n\nThe aim of e-Seva (\u201celectronic service\u201d) is to provide services to citizens\nunder one roof. The e-Seva project, first implemented by the Andhra Pradesh\ngovernment on 25 August 2001, allows citizens to pay their utility bills and\ntaxes, register births and deaths, obtain birth and death certificates, apply for\npassports, file sales tax returns, and pay bills to telecom companies, all under\none roof. Previously, the citizens availed themselves of these services at many\ndifferent offices, in the process going up against petty bureaucratic corruption,\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n447\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f448\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nand generally wasting much time. Now e-Seva provides a one-stop shop for\nmore  than  66  G2C  and  B2C  services.  Many  more  services  like  railway\nreservations  are  in  the  pipeline.  Forty-six  e-Seva  centers,  with  400  service\ncounters, are spread over the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad, and\nalso Ranga Reddy district, and any citizen in these areas can access the services\nat an e-Seva service center. The centers are open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. on\nworking days and 9 a.m. to 3 pm on holidays (second Saturday and Sunday of\neach month). Payments can be made by cash, check, or demand draft, with a\ncredit card, or on the Internet.\n\nThis project is a tremendous success and has been extended to other\nparts  of  the  state,  including  the  rural  areas.  It  cost  Rs360  million  ($7.82\nmillion). In August 2001, collections amounted to a modest Rs 4.3 million\n($0.093 million); by 2004, they had reached Rs2.5 billion ($0.54 billion).\neSeva centers now collect revenues of Rs3 billion ($0.06 billion) monthly and\nserve  3.5  million  citizens.  eSeva  has  succeeded  in  providing  all  services  to\ncitizens under one roof and in making the processes transparent and eliminating\ncorruption (www.esevaonline.com, Raghuveer 2005).\n\nDiscussion\n\nAn analysis of the above cases amply demonstrates that e-governance\n\ncan be very effective in reducing corruption or eliminating it altogether.\n\nCorruption  flourishes  where  there  is  no  transparency  in  government\nfunctioning. The availability of high-quality information about governance\nenhances transparency. Most of the e-governance projects studied above have\nincreased transparency by making available information about the functioning\nof government and its officials to the citizens around the clock or on demand\nby using technologies like the Internet. The Saukaryam project, for example,\nprovided total transparency in awarding public works contracts by publishing\nall the relevant information on the Web. This transparency in operations and\ndecision making has greatly eliminated corruption. The more transparent the\nsystem of governance, the less the opportunities for corruption.\n\nMost e-governance projects brought governance (services) to the citizen\u2019s\ndoorstep. Under the old system, for every service the citizen had to go to the\ndepartment concerned and hand over the applications for the service to officials.\nThis face-to-face contact gave the officials the opportunity to extract bribes,\nwhich most citizens felt compelled to pay to speed up the service and not have\nto make another visit. With e-government projects like Saukaryam, Bhoomi,\nand Customs Online, citizens and businesses can get now services without\nmeeting  any  officials.  Thus,  e-governance  projects  strike  at  the  root  of\ncorruption by eliminating opportunities to commit it.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n448\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fRole of E-Governance in Tackling Corruption: The Indian Experience\n\n449\n\n Complex and ambiguous rules and cumbersome procedures give officials\ndiscretionary  powers,  which  are  the  root  cause  of  corruption  in  many\norganizations like the customs, income tax, and road transport departments.\nIn Gujarat, the road transport officials enjoyed unquestioned discretionary\npowers in checking vehicles or setting the penalties levied on truck operators.\nThe  computerized  interstate  checkpoint  project  has  taken  away  the\ndiscretionary powers of road transport inspectors by making innovative use of\ntechnology and simplifying the process. The fivefold increase in state revenue\nproves  how  effective  the  e-governance  project  has  been  in  eliminating\ncorruption.\n\nAs the government is the sole provider of many services to citizens, the\nofficials used the government monopoly to commit corruption by delaying or\ndenying services to the citizens. In the manual system in Karnataka state, no\none could get an RTC from the village accountant within a reasonable amount\nof time without paying a bribe. In the Bhoomi project of Karnataka, CARD,\nand other e-governance initiatives, technology helped overcome the problem\nof monopoly by setting service levels. Government agencies or officials could\nno longer delay the service for want of bribes.\n\nThe e-governance projects discussed above made the government and\nits officials accountable for their actions. Unlike the manual processes, the\ncomputerized  systems  allow  all  actions  to  be  traced  back  to  the  source.\nResponsibility  for  inappropriate  actions  or  incorrect  decisions  can  thus  be\ndetermined. Citizens can track their applications and complaints, and bring\nany delay to the notice of higher authorities. Unlike the paper-based systems,\nthe computerized systems enable superiors while working online to monitor\nthe progress and retrieve electronic documents. The publication of budgets,\nperformance indicators, and citizen\u2019s charters also helps improve accountability\nand reduce corruption.\n\nIn most cases, the reduction of corruption is a by-product of a primary\nobjective like enhancing the speed of delivery of services to citizens. But as the\nCVC Web site experiment proved, such e-governance initiatives can be used\nto declare war on corruption. Despite strong objections from many quarters,\nthe CVC persisted with the initiative, which awakened the consciousness of\nthe society. Many corrupt officials had to face the ignominy of finding their\nnames in the published list.\n\nSuccessful e-governance systems standardized rules and procedures, and\nreengineered processes to eliminate discretion. The design of the systems did\nnot permit any deviation from the established procedure, and nonconformance\nwas  reported.  Similarly,  features  contributing  to  accountability  and\ntransparency were deliberately built into the design of the systems. However,\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n449\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f450\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\ne-governance systems also need continuous monitoring and assessment. The\ngovernments cannot afford to be complacent after the initial success. Once\nthe employees understand the new system, some of them can develop new\nways to circumvent the system or they can contribute to the project\u2019s premature\ndemise  through  other  means.  Gujarat\u2019s  interstate  checkpoint  project  is  an\nexample of this.\n\nTo fight corruption, e-governance projects must be selected from areas\nwhere opportunities for corruption are high, and the citizens must be involved\nright from the design stage. The design should be based on what the citizens\nwant  rather  than  what  the  government  thinks  they  want  (the  traditional\napproach).  But  the  use  of  ICT  alone  will  not  guarantee  the  success  of  an\ne-governance project in achieving its objective and eradicating corruption.\nThe processes must be examined thoroughly and reengineered, as using ICT\nwith outdated processes only increases corruption by providing opportunities\nto perform corrupt practices faster.\n\nMost of the e-governance projects discussed above (including Bhoomi,\nSaukaryam, and CARD) have also improved government revenues and paid\nback the investment in a few months of their operation. E-governance projects\nlike Bhoomi, VOICE, Saukaryam, and e-Seva have generated employment\nopportunities for the poor. These projects have also proved that problems like\nilliteracy and the digital divide can be tackled through innovative use of ICT;\nthe Bhoomi project is a clear example of this.\n\nMuch research has been done on corruption and e-governance. But not\nmany  studies  have  focused  on  the  impact  of  e-governance  on  corruption.\nWell-designed citizen feedback surveys can be of immense help in improving\nthe e-governance projects and are urgently needed.\n\nConclusion\n\nCorruption destabilizes society by creating social tensions. Corruption\nalso indirectly increases the crime rate and violence in the society. Rampant\ncorruption  in  government  has  pushed  many  young  people  into  extremist\ngroups. The  e-governance  projects  discussed  above  have  made  governing\ntransparent,  taken  away  arbitrary  and  discretionary  powers  of  government\nservants, and made these government servants accountable. The citizens now\nhave more say in governance and feel empowered. The e-governance projects\nhave showed that innovative use of ICT not only improves services to citizens\nbut also reduces corruption and improves government revenues, which can\nbe used for socially relevant areas like health, education, eradication of poverty,\nand  the  uplift  of  the  downtrodden.  The  e-governance  projects  have  also\ngenerated employment especially for the rural poor. All the citizens share equal\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n450\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fRole of E-Governance in Tackling Corruption: The Indian Experience\n\n451\n\nopportunities; no one is more equal than others. E-governance alone may not\nbe enough to eradicate corruption, but it certainly can complement other\nefforts. Conversely, the elimination of corruption results in good governance.\nIn the light of the Indian experience, we conclude that e-governance has the\npotential to tackle corruption effectively and usher in societal harmony.\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n451\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\f452\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nReferences\n\nAll India Reporter (AIR). 2000.

Kiranmai3\n\nIntroduction\n\nInnovations  in  governance  and  public  services  have  led  to  societal\nharmony  in  developed  countries.  Similar  reforms  are  being  carried  out  in\nmany  Asian  countries. This  paper  discusses  the  participatory  governance\nreforms that have been introduced in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh to\nboost societal harmony.\n\nScope of the Study\n\nThe paper starts by discussing the concept of stakeholder participation\nin  governance  in  Andhra  Pradesh  and  then  goes  on  to  discuss  innovative\nprograms  based  on  the  concept.  The  programs  reviewed  here  are  the\nJanmabhoomi  (serve  the  motherland)  Program,  water  users\u2019  associations,\nwatershed development program, and vana samrakshana samithis (community\nforest management groups).\n\nMethodology Used\n\nAn impact evaluation exercise was undertaken to gauge the effectiveness\nof these schemes in the light of suitable parameters.  Achievements in the core\nareas  were  compared  with  the  status  of  the  core  programs  in  2000  and\nmilestones  to  be  achieved  in  2010  and  2020.  Policy  makers,  government\nofficials,  and  other  stakeholders  were  interviewed.  A  pre-designed  and\nstructured questionnaire was used in the interviews.\n\nFree veterinary camps organized in five districts of Andhra Pradesh as\npart of the Janmabhoomi Program were evaluated in detail. First, 599 livestock\nowners in 42 villages in the five districts, 59 departmental staff and nodal\nofficers, and 46 people\u2019s representatives were interviewed. Then qualitative\n\n1 Assistant Professor, Post Graduate AV College, Hyderabad, India.\n2 Associate Director, Institute of Public Enterprises, OU Campus, Hyderabad, India.\n3 Research Associate, Institute of Public Enterprises, OU Campus, Hyderabad, India.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n464\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fInnovations in Governance and Public Service: The Case of Andhra Pradesh State in India\n\n465\n\ninformation was obtained through observations and detailed discussions with\npeople\u2019s representatives, village functionaries, and district officials.\n\nThe  innovations  have  fundamentally  transformed  the  government-\npeople interface. But implementation has been far from perfect. Some critical\naspects,  such  as  transaction  cost,  change  management,  and  institutional\nreform,  have  not  received  the  required  attention  from  government,  such\nthat  the  achievement  of  the  objective  of  societal  harmony  has  been\nundermined. The  survey  findings  indicated,  for  instance,  that  veterinary\nservices have indeed been brought closer to the local people, as planned.\nBut  those  surveyed  also  felt  that  the  program  must  be  strengthened  and\nsustained. The veterinary camps were seen to be constrained by inadequacy\nof personnel, drug supplies, and logistical support.\n\nThe Janmabhoomi Program\n\nThe Janmabhoomi Program was launched in the state of Andhra Pradesh\non 1 January 1997. This people-centered participatory development process\nreportedly evolved out of the experience gained in the implementation of the\nPrajala Vaddaku Palana (taking administration to the people) and Sharmadan\n(volunteer labor for development) programs and micro-level planning in the\nstate from November 1995 to December 1996. The program was deemed\nnecessary because of uneven and inequitable development, and the wide gap\nbetween  the  people\u2019s  aspirations  and  their  fulfillment,  particularly  for  the\npoorest  of  the  poor.  The  people\u2019s  participation  in  formulating  and\nimplementing development schemes had not been effectively harnessed; they\nhad become mere beneficiaries instead of partners in development.\n\nThe Janmabhoomi concept envisions public participation in all aspects\nof development. Everyone is encouraged to internalize the time-tested values\nof  sacrifice,  hard  work,  diligence,  discipline,  honesty,  self-respect,  and  the\nquest  for  excellence,  and  every  institution,  the  principles  of  participation,\nequity and equality, transparency and accountability, organizational excellence,\nand sustainability. As the village develops, so will the wider area, the district,\nthe state, the country, and the people as a whole.\n\nObjectives and Interventions\n\nThe interventions contemplated under Janmabhoomi are sensitization\nand values education, promotion of grassroots people\u2019s institutions built around\nspecific interests (such as women\u2019s thrift and credit groups, youth groups, and\nwatershed committees), institutional strengthening of local bodies through\ndecentralization and participatory planning, training and orientation for all\nthose involved in program implementation, and administrative reforms.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n465\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f466\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nAll  activities  of  public  bodies  are  subjected  to  social  audit,  and  each\ndepartment has a citizen\u2019s charter, which sets standards for the services to be\nprovided to the citizens. Emphasis is given to awareness building through the\nspread of knowledge and information.\n\nCore Areas\n\nThe  core  areas  of  the  Janmabhoomi  Program  are  community  works,\nprimary education, primary health care and family welfare, environmental\nconservation, and responsive governance.\n\nCommunity works under Janmabhoomi are taken up to provide basic\nservices to the people, strengthen social and human development infrastructure,\nand give sustained employment to the unemployed and the underemployed.\nThese  community  works  are  categorized  into  priority,  permissible,  and\nrestricted work. The priority work includes supply of drinking water, sanitation\nand access to primary health care and education. The permissible work includes\nthe  construction  of  community  halls  and  link  roads. The  restricted  work\nincludes construction of marriage halls, open air theaters, high school buildings.\nThe people (except for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes) contribute 30%\nof  the  costs  in  priority  work,  50%  in  permissible  work,  and  100%  (no\ncounterpart  funding  from  government)  in  restricted  work.  Except  for  the\nscheduled castes and scheduled tribes, which constitute the weaker section of\nsociety, in all other cases the contribution has to come in the form of funding.\nThe scheduled castes and scheduled tribes are completely exempt from funding\nthe Janmabhoomi programs.\n\nThe focus in the core area of health and family welfare is on providing\neffective, accessible, and affordable basic health care and family services to\nensure  child  survival,  development,  and  protection,  and  equal  status  and\nopportunity for women.\n\nProgram Goals\n\nThe goals to be achieved in the core area of primary health care and\n\nfamily welfare in 2000, 2010, and 2020 are presented in Table 1.\n\nEnvironmental Conservation\n\nThe community activities in the core area of environmental conservation\nare campaigns for clean and green villages, clean and green towns, sanitation\nmaintenance (a weekly drive), construction of individual sanitary latrines suited\nto  the  local  conditions,  planting  of  trees,  and  popularization  of\nnonconventional energy sources like biogas and smokeless chullahs (stoves),\nsolar energy, and windmills.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n466\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fInnovations in Governance and Public Service: The Case of Andhra Pradesh State in India\n\n467\n\nTable 1: Primary Health Care and Family Welfare Goals\nof the Janmabhoomi Program\n\nArea\n\nIndicator\n\nAs of\n1 January\n1997\n\nGoal\n2010\n\n2020\n\nPopulation\nand\n Health\n\nChild Survival,\nDevelopment,\n and Protection\n\nWomen\u2019s\nEmpowerment\n\nCrude birth rate (%)\nCrude death rate (%)\nTotal fertility rate (%)\nInfant morality rate (%)\nMaternal mortality rate (%)\nLife expectancy at birth\n(years): Male\nLife expectancy at birth\n(years): Female\n\nIncidence of low birth\nweight (%)\nChildren 6\u20139 months receiving\nfood supplements (%)\nFully immunized children (%)\nPreschool children receiving\nvitamin A dose (%)\nEarly detection and rehabilitation\nof disabled children (%)\n\nLiteracy rate among females\naged 7 and above (%)\nEnrollment rate of females (%):\nPrimary school\nWomen getting married below\n18 years (%)\nAnemia prevalence among\nwomen (%)\nSkilled work force among\nwomen (%)\nWomen\u2019s participation in\norganized sector (%)\nReservation for women local \u2013\nself government institutions (%)\nAccess to cheap credit (%)\n\n24\n8.4\n2.60\n66\n3.8\n61\n\n63.7\n\n33\n\n48\n\n40\n42.4\n\n0\n\n32.7\n\n42.4\n\n53\n\n60\n\n<10\n\n14\n\n33.3\n<10\n\n60\n<10\n\n2000\n\n19\n7.5\n2\n45\n2\n63.5\n\n66\n\n20\n\n55\n\n80\n70\n\n25\n\n40\n\n61\n\n45\n\n40\n\n10\n\n30\n\n33.3\n30\n\n70\n50\n\n15\n7\n1.5\n30\n1.2\n66.5\n\n70\n\n16\n\n75\n\n100\n100\n\n50\n\n75\n\n85\n\n30\n\n25\n\n30\n\n50\n\n50\n50\n\n85\n80\n\nHousehold\n\nConsumption of iodized salt (%)\nAccess to basic sanitation (%)\n\nSource: Janmabhoomi Operational Guidelines, Government of Andhra Pradesh, 1997, page 30.\n\n13\n6\n1.5\n15\n0.5\n69\n\n73\n\n8\n\n100\n\n100\n100\n\n75\n\n100\n\n100\n\n10\n\n10\n\n60\n\n50\n\nNil\n>80\n\n100\n100\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n467\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f468\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nInstitutional Arrangements\n\nTeams of Janmabhoomi volunteers headed by social activists are formed\nin every habitation to encourage participation in the core areas. Among other\nactivities, the team members assist in house-to-house surveys. An official of\nthe village or gram panchayat (village governance unit; the lowest unit of local\ngovernance) is designated as habitation officer (in the rural areas) or ward\nofficer (in the urban areas), and convenor of the habitation or ward committee.\nAt the mandal level, there is a mandal committee consisting of the mandal\nparishad president (the member-convenor), the mandal development officer,\nand  the  nodal  officer.  A  mandal  parishad  is  the  assembly  of  elected\nrepresentatives of the various villages constituting a mandal. The members of\nthe state legislative assembly are ex-officio members of the mandal committees\nin their jurisdiction. The mandal committees meet once a month to supervise\nand  monitor  the  implementation  of  all  the  core  area  activities  under  the\nprogram at the mandal level. A mandal (lowermost institutionalized tier of\nthe state administration) constitutes a population ranging from 35,000 to\n500,000.\n\nMonitoring\n\nThe information system developed by the planning department is used\nin monitoring the implementation at all levels of the core area activities under\nJanmabhoomi. The habitation committee and the nodal officer maintain two\nregisters at the mandal level, namely, the community works register and the\nregister of felt needs, which are updated during the weekly review meetings.\nThe state monitoring cell in the planning department makes the Janmabhoomi\ninformation systems operational at the habitation, slum, mandal, municipality,\ndistrict, and state levels.\n\nVeterinary Camps\n\nThe aim is to organize veterinary camps in all gram panchayat headquarters\nand major habitations with focus on free vaccination against foot-and-mouth\ndisease for graded buffalos and jersey cows, and free deworming of sheep. The\nveterinary camps also offer periodic health checkups and treatment. Thus, the\ncamps cover both the preventive and curative aspects of animal health care.\n\nThe animal husbandry department of Andhra Pradesh with its 5,004\nfield establishments and institutions has been serving the needs of the 28,465\ngram panchayats and major hamlets. It has received a much-needed boost from\nthe Janmabhoomi Program of veterinary camps with its emphasis on reaching\ncattle  and  cattle  owners  in  remote  villages,  bringing  in  the  concept  of\npreoperative provision of animal health care and the assurance of better funding.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n468\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fInnovations in Governance and Public Service: The Case of Andhra Pradesh State in India\n\n469\n\nTable 2 shows the number of animals vaccinated and sheep dewormed\nin  the  veterinary  camps  in  the  last  five  (fourth  to  eighth)  rounds  of  the\nJanmabhoomi Program.

These reforms are seen as vital to both the welfare and the economic\ndevelopment of the state. They are also seen as inevitable, given the history of\nthe irrigation system, the shrinking command area, and the increasing inability\nof government to manage and run the large canal systems. There are bottlenecks\nin the irrigation structure. Hundreds of thousands of acres of land have been\ndeprived of water. On the one hand, the weather has its vagaries; on the other\nhand, the water facilities do not reach the parched lands. Hence, for the fields\nto yield good produce, irrigation management has to be reformed.\n\nThe irrigation reforms and the establishment of water users\u2019 associations\n(WUAs) in Andhra Pradesh are steps in the right direction. The reforms aim\nto achieve high production, increase efficiency and equity, and build the land\nand  water  management  capacity  of  the  new  institutions.5 These  reforms\nassume  that  the  transfer  of  rights  from  the  irrigation  department  to  the\n\n4 Rs45 = $1 as of 31 March 2005.\n5 At the initiative of the government of Andhra Pradesh, the Government of India has also issued\nguidelines to all states for earmarking funds for the forestry sector under Environmental Assistance\nScheme and Jawahar Rojgar Yojana.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n469\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f470\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nWUAs will improve the management of the system, through the collective\naction of the members.\n\nThe main functions of the WUAs are to repair the canals and supervise\nwater distribution, settle conflicts, and raise enough funds to sustain their\noperations  on  their  own. The  Andhra  Pradesh  WUAs  have  taken  up  the\nfollowing activities extensively:\n\nIrrigation system surveys\nPlanning for cropping pattern\n\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127) Water management and water budgeting\n(cid:127) Resolution of disputes among farmers\n(cid:127) Operation and maintenance works with collective participation\n(cid:127) Maintenance of accounts\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127) Training and motivation\n\nFinancial and social auditing\n\nThe  recognition  earned  by  WUAs  in  the  state  has  helped  make  the\nexperiment a success. The ideals that prompted the Andhra Pradesh government\nto form the societies have been achieved. Farmers have been given full control\nover the management of irrigation canals, and they have done yeoman service\nto achieve results.\n\nEfficient and Equal Distribution of Water\n\nIrrigation System Development and Management by Farmers. As of\nMarch 2003, the WUAs had completed about 52,500 works for about Rs5,790\nmillion and provided irrigation water to about 404,700 hectares of tail-end\nlands.\n\nTimely Supply of Water and Early Planting. The WUAs have made it\npossible for water to be supplied on time, resulting in a 10% increase in yield.\nIncrease in Ayacut (Cultivable Land). Because of the desilting of canals\nand drains by the WUAs, the tail-end lands now get water. Irrigation now\nreaches up to 200,700 hectares more of land, as of March 2003. Channel silt\nremoval  has  been  undertaken  on  a  wider  scale.  Hundreds  of  thousands  of\nfarmers have enthusiastically participated in the repair works. These silt removal\noperations are perhaps the first of this magnitude. Eliminating contractors\nreduces the cost of works by 20%. Moreover, because of the well-repaired\ncanals, higher income can be obtained from agricultural lands. Every additional\nayacut  that  comes  under  irrigation  fetches  about  Rs7,500  million.  Other\nbenefits resulting from the formation of WUAs are:\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n470\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fInnovations in Governance and Public Service: The Case of Andhra Pradesh State in India\n\n471\n\n(cid:127) Resolution of disputes\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127) Reforms in irrigation administration\n\nImproved drainage and execution of minor drains; capacity building\n\n- Merging of irrigation and drainage wings\n- Merging  of  construction,  operation  and  maintenance,  and\ncommand area development and administration (CADA) wings\n\n- Rationalization of staff distribution\n- Closure of mechanical units\n- Direct contracting\n\nThe management of canal and irrigation projects has empowered the\nfarmers, but it has also produced a few negative results. Without proper training\nfor WUA members and with funds in short supply, operation and maintenance\nis not up to professional standards. Further, the associations are becoming\npoliticized and disputes among farmers have arisen in some places.\n\nWatershed Program\n\nThe watershed program is not a technology but a concept that integrates\nthe conservation, management, and allocation of rainwater through discrete\nhydrological units. In 1997, the government of Andhra Pradesh initiated a\nmassive watershed development program that involved the development of\nwastelands,  degraded  lands  (dry  lands  being  cultivated  under  rain-fed\nconditions),  and  degraded  reserve  forests. The  approach,  as  it  is  evolving,\nenables the identification of wastelands along village boundaries. Community\nparticipation has also been mobilized throughout the state. The main activities\nof the watershed development program are given below:\n\nSoil and moisture conservation\n\n(cid:127) Entry-point activities\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127) Water harvesting structures\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127) Biogas and smokeless chullahs\n(cid:127)\n\nSocial forestry /Agro forestry\nPasture development\n\nSelf-employment revolving fund for thrift groups\n\nVana Samrakshana Samitis (Community Forest\nManagement Groups)\n\n\u201cSave the tree and it will save you.\u201d So the age-old saying goes.

The cultivation of forests will\nenhance  environmental  conservation  and  human  life.  In  Andhra  Pradesh,\n23.2% of the land is forest, but only 11% is dense forest.\n\nThe National Forest Policy of 1988 provides for the people\u2019s involvement\nin forest management, as did a circular issued on 1 June 1990. The government\nof Andhra Pradesh, acknowledging the need for the people\u2019s cooperation in\nthis regard, formed the vana samrakshana samitis (VSSs) to establish a strong\nbond between the people and the forest department. The VSSs have had a\ncommendable role in saving the forests and preventing the smuggling of timber.\nThe citizens and the government have carried out this program with the help\nof a World Bank loan.\n\nAndhra Pradesh is in the forefront of the community forest management\nprogram. While other states reserve only 25% of the rights over forest produce\nto the VSSs, such rights in Andhra Pradesh are 100%. For newly grown\ntimber  and  bamboo,  VSS  members  have  sole  rights,  subject  to  certain\nconditions.\n\nThe following benefits accrue to the VSSs:\n\n(cid:127) Except for timber, all the forest produce belongs to the VSSs, and all\n\nthe income from the produce is enjoyed by the villagers.\n\n(cid:127) VSSs that cooperate in containing the theft of forest produce receive\n\n25% of the penalty for the theft.\n\nSo far, 1.2 million villagers have benefited from this program. As of 31\nMarch 2003, 6,575 VSSs were looking after 16.25 million hectares of forest\nlands.6\n\nTable 3 shows the growth of the VSSs and the extent of their coverage.\nThe progress over the years shows the enthusiastic participation of the\npeople in community forest management in Andhra Pradesh state.

People  do  not  realize  that  unhealthy  economic\ngrowth through exhaustive natural resources extraction, without considering\nthe future of society, imperils the ecosystem. Instead, they are confident that\nthe technological development accompanying high economic performance\nwill solve the problems. The report Limits to Growth published by the Club of\nRome  in  1972  confronted  the  optimism  critically.  It  concluded  that\ninternational development was destroying the environment far beyond the\nlevel  predicted  by  previous  studies,  threatening  continued  economic\ndevelopment. The Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 tried to achieve a\nwin-win situation by increasing production and at the same time upgrading\nthe environment as well as the capacity for long-term development (Martinuzen\n1997, pages 149\u2013152).\n\nDeveloping  countries  react  to  the  debate  differently  from  developed\ncountries. They face different environmental problems from different economic\ncircumstances. Indonesia and other developing countries cope with the scarcity\nand depletion of natural resources simply because their economies rely on\nnatural resources extraction. The decentralized political system in Indonesia\nreveals  more  plainly  the  significance  of  natural  resources  to  the  economy.\nNatural  resources  extraction  is  the  major  source  of  revenue  in  many\nautonomous districts throughout the country, especially those outside Java.\nOnly a few regions, mostly in Java, derive local revenues from industry and\ntrade. During the centralized regime, the central Government subsidized all\ndistricts  uniformly.  In  the  decentralization  period,  they  have  to  be  self-\ngoverning. When  the  idea  of  decentralization  was  first  talked  about,  local\ngovernments were apprehensive about their local revenues. Most of them did\nnot feel that they could get enough income on their own (Dwiyanto 2003,\n\n1\n\nJunior Faculty Member, Department of Social Development, Faculty of Social and Political Sciences,\nGadjah Mada University, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n475\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f476\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\npage 35). They started to think about where and how they could get local\nrevenues. Most of the resource-rich regions, such as Kutai Kartanegara, now\nget most of their revenues from natural resources extraction.\n\nHow to govern the extraction of natural resources is therefore critical.\nInappropriate  governance  leads  to  conflict. There  are  at  least  two  types  of\nconflict: conflicts between local government and the central administration,\nand conflicts between the local people, the private sector, and local government.\nIn  the  New  Order  period,  most  local  governments  with  abundant  natural\nresources felt they did not benefit from revenue sharing. For this reason, many\nprovinces such as Papua tried to separate from Indonesia or to become self-\ngoverned. This type of conflict has died down with decentralization. But the\nsecond type is still raging, and the Indonesian Government has not found a\ncomprehensive solution to the conflict.\n\nMany studies (Aman 2002, CPPS and UNDP 2003, Sumarto 2003,\nWalhi n.d.) show that natural resources management in Indonesia is laden\nwith this second type of conflict. The extraction of natural resources generates\nexternalities manifested in environmental problems (Stiglitz 2000, page 215)\nthat eventually cause conflict. This conflict has a long history. Since the 1980s,\nthere have been conflicts between local communities and business because of\nland  issues.  Dayak  Benuaq  and  Tonyoi,  traditional  communities  in  East\nKalimantan, have opposed gold mining by PT Kelian Equatorial Mining in\ntheir areas. Dayak Siang, Murung, and Bekumpai, conservative communities\nin central Kalimantan, have tried to protect their traditional land rights from\nillegal occupancy by PT Indomuro Kencana (Aurora Gold), which is digging\ngold  on  their  land.  A  traditional  community  in  Paser  Regency,  East\nKalimantan,  has  struggled  for  its  rights  over  traditional  land  against  PT\nKideco Jaya. In still another case, Amungme, an indigenous tribe in Papua,\nhas been wrangling with PT Freeport Indonesia over its traditional rights\nfor several years (Aman 2002).\n\nThe  Freeport  dispute  is  one  of  the  most  controversial.  Over  the  last\nthree decades, the company has had major conflicts with various parties over\nenvironment, land, and human rights issues. It was sued by Amungme for\nenvironmental and human rights abuse (Sari 1998, page 10). With the help\nof the Government and the armed forces, Freeport violently suppressed civil\ndisobedience by Amungme, as well as Komoro; many local people died (Sari\n1998, page 11; Walhi n.d., page 21). Walhi, an Indonesian nongovernment\norganization (NGO) concerned with on environmental issues, also accused\nthe corporation of environmental deterioration (Walhi n.d., page 21), saying\nthat the company has caused physical destruction to the environment, and\ncontaminated  35,820  hectares  of  land  and  84,154  hectares  of  ocean  area.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n476\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fThe Proper Role of Government in Natural Resources Management in Indonesia\n\n477\n\nHowever, Freeport has denied any responsibility. It claims that it applies the\nbest mining practices (Walhi n.d., page 24).\n\nThe conflicts arise because the Indonesian Government cannot enforce\na comprehensive system for responding to the externalities. The contract to\nexcavate is signed by the mining corporation and the central Government.\nThose affected by the externalities, i.e., the local government and the local\npeople, are not involved (Sumarto 2003, page 6). The corporation believes\nthat it complies with government requirements. The local government and\nthe  local  people  believe  that  they  are  entitled  to  compensation.  Each  side\nsticks to its claims in its own way, in line with its interests.\n\nIn  fact,  there  are  regulations  for  figuring  out  and  dealing  with  the\nexternalities. After signing the contract, the corporation is required to carry\nout a community development program to empower the local people living\naround its plant. Most local communities are poor and need social assistance.\nThe program also provides compensation for the externalities. To protect the\nenvironment, the corporation has at least two obligations: install a facility to\ncontain  toxic  waste  and  reduce  its  effects,  and  restore  the  ecosystem  after\nextracting natural resources. But many corporations do not comply. Moreover,\nthey are not subjected to significant sanctions. All this is due to rent seeking\n(see Clark 1991, page 108).\n\nThe situation is complicated by asymmetric information: the local people\nhave no access to information about toxic waste and its impact, especially\nwith the corporation doing its best to conceal the information (Sumarto 2005,\npage 4). As the local community lives close to the business, it is in a position\nto control the extraction. Ideally, if the control mechanism worked, governance\nwould be more transparent, asymmetric information and rent seeking could\nbe restrained, and externalities could be dealt with more easily. But the people\nare not aware of the damage wrought or of the importance of environmental\nprotection. A meaningful way to develop such awareness is by attacking this\nissue in the education system.\n\nThis paper discusses the conflicts in natural resources management, the\nrole of government in natural resources extraction, and the need to build a\ncommon consciousness of peaceful and sustainable environmental governance.\n\nEconomic Development and Natural Resources Management:\nThe Role of Government\n\nThe analysis of links between environmental protection and economic\ndevelopment shows a major incongruity (Martinuzen 1997, page 147). The\nmain concern is how to achieve high economic performance without causing\nharm to the environment. But there is often a trade-off between these two\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n477\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f478\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nobjectives (Clark 1991, page 258). If the extraction of natural resources is not\nregulated, production will increase but the ecosystem will be at risk. On the\ncontrary, regulations that are too tight may protect environment but will also\ndiscourage investment. To guarantee sustainable growth, a proper role is needed\nfor government.\n\nThe theory of government, and, in a broader context, state theory, has\nstirred  thoughtful  discussion  among  scholars.  Jessop  (1990,  pages  2\u20134)\nsystematically maps the shifts in state theory. In the 1970s, the theory was\ndominated by Marxism. The assumption was that the state functioned within\nthe class struggle. In the 1980s, sociopolitical scientists lost interest in the\ntheoretical debate and concerned themselves with empirical studies. A major\ncause of this shift was globalization. As the globalization discourse spread,\nacademics saw a reduced role for the state in formulating public policy.\n\nMarxism  rejects  the  notion  of  a  \u201cproper\u201d  role  for  government.  In  a\ncapitalist  system,  according  to  the  Marxists,  government  stands  for  the\ninterests  of  the  bourgeoisie  and  facilitates  the  accumulation  of  capital.\nHeightened conflict between the classes could lead to a revolution by the\nworkers, who seize power and establish a government that embodies their\ncollective interests\u2014what Marx called the \u201cdictatorship of the proletariat\u201d\n(Clark  1991,  pages  111\u2013112).  In  contrast,  economic  liberalists  view\ngovernment as providing wider room for private interests to expand their\neconomic activities. The less the government intervenes in the market, the\nbetter (Clark 1991, page 106).\n\nBut in a democratic society, neither capitalists nor workers prevail. A\ndemocratic government is a constitutional elective government based on law\nand  representing  the  aspirations  of  all  the  people.  The  proper  role  of\ngovernment in a democracy is mediating the competition between the classes\n(Jessop 1990, pages 171\u2013174).\n\nSimilarly, society is assumed to be pluralist. It encompasses various groups\nor classes with different interests. While they may contend with and try to\ncontrol one another, no one group or class dominates the society. The state is\ntherefore seen as an arena of conflict between interest groups, and the policy-\nmaking process as political bargaining between conflicting groups. Government\nmust regulate conflicts in society so that they are resolved peacefully (Smith\n1995, pages 209\u2013227).\n\nSince interest groups and classes compete against one another, the state\nrepresents a variety of group pressures (Smith 1995, page 211). In fact, although\nthe legitimate government takes authority through legal means, i.e., election,\nthe process involves many compromises among interest groups. This implies\npolitical  contracts  between  the  government  and  the  interest  groups  that\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n478\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fThe Proper Role of Government in Natural Resources Management in Indonesia\n\n479\n\nsupported it in the election, obliging the government to protect those interests.\nIn a country in which corruption is high, such as Indonesia, giving government\na central role in controlling natural resources management is risky. Natural\nresources management must be transparent. Civil society should be empowered\nso that it can watch how government administers natural resources extraction.\n\nDecentralization and Conflicts related to Natural Resources\n\nDecentralization is generally associated with political-economic values.\nIt  brings  government  close  to  the  people  so  that  accountability,  efficiency\n(Smith 1985, pages 4\u20135), and transparency are reinforced. At the same time,\npublic services improve (see Bailey 1999, page 44). Political-economic reform\nleading to a decentralized system in Indonesia is still chaotic and the desired\nvalues have not yet been achieved. The reform has been carried out in the\ngeneral political euphoria as political aspirations, stifled during the Suharto\nadministration, can now be spontaneously expressed. In the transition, the\nnew system is unable to make the proper adjustments, anarchy seems to reign,\nand conflicts tend to escalate (see Dwiyanto 2003, page 59).\n\nThe complexity of the conflicts can be discerned from their variety and\nthe  stakeholders  involved.  According  to  a  study  on  governance  and\ndecentralization  in  20  provinces  in  Indonesia  (Dwiyanto  2003,  pages  62\u2013\n70), the conflicts encompass disputes between political party supporters, land\ndisputes, conflicts related to natural resources management, and violence. They\ntake place among local governments, between local government and the people,\nbetween labor and management, and among ethnic as well as religious groups.\nCorporations,  local  governments,  and  local  communities  behave\ndifferently with one another (Sumarto 2003, pages 5\u20138). Conflicts between\nlocal communities and corporations, which were latent in the New Order\nperiod, have escalated in the decentralization period. Local people are pressing\ncorporations to pay damages. Local governments are requiring businesses to\nhire local people for their plants, and also to assess environmental impact.\nMoreover, corporations are expected to support local governments in providing\nsocial services to local people. The corporations have no choice but to comply\nwith these demands to diminish the threat of conflict, which to them is a risk\nto production. They allocate funds for local government and they carry out\ncommunity development programs.\n\nUnocal, a private petroleum mining company that has been operating\nin  Marangkayu,  East  Kutai,  East  Kalimantan,  since  the  1970s,  began\nconducting community development programs in 2002, after the Marangkayu\ncommunity protested against the pollution caused by the company. The conflict\nturned  violent\u2014a  demonstrator  was  shot  by  military  troops  hired  by  the\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n479\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f480\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\ncompany to secure the plant\u2014and the case was brought to court. Unocal was\ncompelled to implement the community development programs (CPPS and\nUNDP 2003, pages 44\u201345).\n\nCaltex Pacific Indonesia (CPI) has also been operating in Indonesia for\ndecades, but it began to conduct community development programs only in\nresponse to local demands (CPPS and UNDP 2003, page 71). One CPI case\nwas  quite  complicated.  The  Duri  community,  living  near  a  CPI  plant,\ncomplained  of  health  and  economic  problems  caused  by  the  expansion  of\nCPI\u2019s oil exploration activities. The extension narrowed the distance between\nthe  company  premises  and  the  residential  area  to  only  about  150  meters.\nArtesian wells in the community began to dry up and the supply of potable\nwater  became  a  serious  problem.  Fishponds  also  dried  up.  The  Duri\ncommunity, through the local legislature, demanded compensation from CPI.\nThe local legislature could not solve the dispute and the case was elevated to\nthe central assembly. The issue is still pending (CPPS and UNDP 2003, pages\n78\u201380).\n\nEnvironmental damage is caused not only by private corporations but\nalso by state-owned mining-companies. Belitung, a district where the state-\nowned tin mining company PT Timah used to operate, now faces serious\nenvironmental  problems. The  tin  has  been  exhausted,  so  the  company  no\nlonger works in the area. It left wide holes, which pose the risk of erosion and\nin the rainy season could be breeding grounds for malaria-carrying mosquitoes.\nThe company also did not undertake programs to protect the environment\nand empower the local people (Sumarto 2005, page 11). A similar situation\ncan be observed in mining sites worked by Pertamina, a state-owned petroleum\nmining company.\n\nThe local people are powerless, and yet neither the local NGOs nor the\nlocal governments support them. The role of government is to protect the\npeople, but, instead of empowering them, the local governments prefer to\nseek rents. The case of Kapital shows how local NGOs would rather work for\nlocal bureaucrats and corporations than for the local community. Kapital is a\nlocal NGO established to help supervise the community development programs\nof corporations in Kutai Timur, East Kalimantan. Kapital was appointed by\nKaltim Prima Coal and Unocal. Since a sizable amount has been allocated for\nthe programs, the participation of local elites is not without economic motives.\nThey  work  hand  in  hand  with  the  corporations  through  the  NGO. The\nappointment of Kapital, however, caused the dismissal of other NGOs, which\nwere more competent (Sumarto 2003, page 8). Local protests went unheeded.\nSuch occurrences are common throughout Indonesia.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n480\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fThe Proper Role of Government in Natural Resources Management in Indonesia\n\n481\n\nNatural Resources Management: Social Responsibility\nand Sustainability\n\nOver the last 5 years, the private sector has made significant moves to\npromote community development programs and environmental protection\nin Indonesia (Sumarto 2005, page 5). The extractive companies, most of them\nin remote areas, perceive a higher risk in conflicts than do manufacturing,\nbanking, and services companies, which are usually in urban areas. Hence,\nmotivated by profit, the extractive companies, particularly those in the mining\nindustry,  are  leading  the  environmental  sustainability  movement.  The\nmovement is not confined to Indonesia. It is a global phenomenon. In 2000,\nthe United Nations (UN) established the UN Global Compact, a framework\nof corporate social responsibility (CSR) for the private sector representing the\nsector\u2019s  commitment  to  human  rights,  labor  standards,  environmental\nprotection,  and  the  fight  against  corruption.  Community  development\nprograms, in this context, are simply a part of CSR.\n\nType of Program\n\nMechanism\n\nSubjects\n\nCharacteristics\n\nCharity\n\n(cid:130) Building\nphysical\nfacilities\nprograms\n\n(cid:130) Giving financial\nand technical\nendowment\n\nCSR Programs\n\n(cid:130) education\n(cid:130) health\n(cid:130) clean water\n(cid:130) sports\n(cid:130) income\n\ngeneration\n\n(cid:130) religion\n(cid:130) transportation\n(cid:130) agriculture\n(cid:130) home industry\n\nCapacity building\n\nTraining\n\n(cid:130) In general, the programs are not\n\nintended to empower local\npeople to cope in the post-\nextraction period.\n\n(cid:130) The coordination between the\ncorporations and the local\ngovernments where the programs\nare being conducted are not\nsmooth.\n\n(cid:130) Generally, the programs are\n\ndesigned by the corporations\nin top-down fashion.\n\n(cid:130) Local people and the local\n\ngovernments do not get many\nopportunities to participate in the\nimplementation of the programs.\nAlthough the opportunity is not\nsignificant, they obtain it in the\ncase of agricultural programs.\n(cid:130) The programs are not planned\n\n(cid:130) The programs do not empower\n\nsystematically.\n\nlocal people.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSources:  Modified  from  the  results  of  interviews  and  focus  group  discussions  with  local  people  and  with  district and\nprovincial government officers (Sumarto 2005, page 14).\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n481\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f482\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nThe concept of CSR is itself controversial. Some people may argue that\ndecentralization and welfare pluralism (see Midgley 1997, page 8; Spicker\n1995, pages 115\u2013117) give the private sector, as well as civil society, wider\nroom  to  contribute  to  socioeconomic  development.  Others  may  question\nwhether the profit-maximizing private sector has the social responsibility to\nredistribute profits for community development and environmental protection.\nA  study  on  the  CSR  programs  of  three  mining  companies  and  one\nagricultural company in East Kalimantan and Riau provinces (CPPS and UNDP\n2003) (see table) showed that corporations carry out such programs not out of\na sense of social responsibility, according to the UN Global Compact, but to\ngain the public trust and to secure their production facilities. Public trust is a\nlong-term investment of corporations. Many cases show that corporations with\nan unhealthy track record in environmental protection and unresolved conflicts\nwith the people cannot get their trust and, consequently, can no longer operate.\nSince the programs are simply a response to specific protests, they are\nnot concerned with the broader goal of empowering the local people. The\nprograms  do  not  provide  ample  opportunity  for  the  local  community  to\nparticipate. They are planned centrally by the corporations. The programs\nalso do not equip the local people to cope in the period after the extraction,\nwhen the companies leave and the local economy is made vulnerable (Sumarto\n2005, pages 13\u201314).\n\n25\n\n30\n\nFigure 1: Company Actions in\nResponse to Environmental Damage\n\nThe  corporations\u2019  production  processes  cannot  be  dissociated  from\nenvironmental contamination. They must therefore solve the problems they\ncause.  Figure  1  shows  how  the\nprivate sector actually responds to\nenvironmental  damage.  A  high\nproportion of the companies take\nno  action.  Since  conflicts  are\nmainly triggered by environmental\nproblems  and  demands  for\ncompensation,  the  companies\u2019\nenvironmental  protection  and\ncommunity development programs\nnot  only  do  not  answer  the\nproblems they were meant to solve\nbut  also  put  sustainable  natural\nresources  management  at  risk  (see\nWeaver, Rock, and Kusterer 1997,\npage 2; Conca 1996, pages 25\u201329).\n\nSource: Center for Population and Policy Studies, Gadjah Mada\nUniversity, Governance and Decentralization Surveys, 2002.\n\nChange \nthe method \nof production\n\ns\ne\ne\ng\ng\na\na\nt\nn\nt\nn\ne\nc\ne\nr\nc\ne\nr\nP\ne\nP\n\nTake\nno action\n\nReforest Relocate\n\nRecycle\nwaste\n\nthe activities\n\n20\n\n10\n\n15\n\n0\n\n5\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n482\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fThe Proper Role of Government in Natural Resources Management in Indonesia\n\n483\n\nDecentralization and the Challenge to Develop Transparent\nControl Mechanisms\n\nIf the private sector does not show adequate concern for environmental\nproblems in practice, neither does government. According to Figure 2, only  a\nsmall number of cases of environmental damage are taken to court. The number\nis less than half of the number of cases on which no action is taken.\n\nThere are many ways of controlling environmental degradation and the\nresulting conflicts. Stiglitz (2000, pages 217\u2013233) says that externalities can\nbe remedied by both the public and private sectors, working independently.\nThese  sectors  use  different  methods  but  a  similar  approach,  i.e.,  the  legal\nsystem. The  liberal  perspective,  as  elaborated  by  Clark  (1991,  pages  267\u2013\n269), also emphasizes the importance of the legal system. But to solve the\nproblem of externalities, he says, the appropriate institution is government,\nwhich can enforce environmental laws such as pollution standards. Weaver,\nRock,  and  Kusterer  (1997,  page  254)  also  argue  that  the  efficient  way  to\nprotect the ecosystem is through environmental regulation.\n\nThese recommendations rely on the normative role of government. In\nthe Indonesian case, as described above, the recommendations do not work\nwell. Government cannot contain the ecological damage. Rent seeking worsens\nthe externalities of natural resources management. Since the regulations are\ndesigned to protect the private sector (see Clark 1991, page 108), rent seeking\ndiminishes the ability of government\nto administer the extraction process.\nFigure 3 shows the great inadequacy\nof  legal  means  of  solving  natural\nresources  management  disputes  in\nIndonesia:  violent  means  are  used\nnearly as often, and legal action is\ncertainly much rarer than instances\nwhere no action is taken.\n\nFigure 2: Local Government Actions in\nResponse to Environmental Damage\n\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\ns\ne\ne\ng\ng\na\na\nt\nn\nt\nn\ne\nc\ne\nr\nc\ne\nr\nP\ne\nP\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nIssue \nwarning \n\nPunish \nviolators\n\nStop \nthe\n activities\n\nRelocate \nthe \nactivities\n\nTake the\ncase to\ncourt\n\nTake \nno \naction\n\nSource: Center for Population and Policy Studies, Gadjah Mada\nUniversity, Governance and Decentralization Surveys, 2002.\n\nDuring the decentralization pe-\nriod, rent seeking and corruption tend\nto be higher (Dwiyanto 2003, pages\n117\u2013118). The situation is worsened\nby asymmetric information. To mini-\nmize protests, corporations do not\nshare information about the impact\nof extraction.

If  people  become  more\nliterate  in  the  issues,  natural  resources  management  will  become  more\ntransparent, and asymmetric information and rent seeking can be contained.\nRowe  (2002)  sees  a  clear  relationship  between  environmental  literacy  and\nsocial responsibility. People who are literate in environmental issues possess a\nsufficient conceptual framework and belief in the future of society so that\nthey are not reluctant to take part in resolving environmental problems. This\nsituation, in other words, builds a community-based control mechanism for\nnatural resources extraction.\n\nSource:  Center  for  Population  and  Policy  Studies,    Gadjah\nMada  University,  Governance  and  Decentralization  Surveys,\n2002.\n\nTake no\naction\n\nLegal \naction\n\nMany experiences, such as those of Botswana, Namibia, Bulgaria, and\nFlorida in the US, show comprehensive efforts to respond to environmental\nproblems through education. Jones (1999) writes that the governments of\nBotswana and Namibia have been training their people in sustainable natural\nresources management. With the goal of community-based natural resources\nmanagement, the Government of Botswana is enhancing public awareness of\nenvironmental issues through curriculum development, among other methods.\nAn educational curriculum has also been developed in Bulgaria, Markowitz\n(1993) says, to foster environmental literacy and appreciation of the ecosystem\namong schoolchildren. Monroe (2003) describes 11 years of implementation\nof environmental education in the US state of Florida. The program is aimed\nat increasing the environmental literacy of youth and adults.\n\nDeveloping an environmental curriculum, with local content, is not a\nnew approach, but it has not been carried out systematically in Indonesia.\nDuring  the  centralized  regime,  it  was  out  of  the  question.  The  central\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n484\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fThe Proper Role of Government in Natural Resources Management in Indonesia\n\n485\n\nGovernment issued the curriculum and implemented it uniformly throughout\nIndonesia. The widely diverse local conditions were not accommodated. In\nthe decentralization period, the system has changed. The decentralized system\nallows  district  education  officials  to  develop  a  curriculum  based  on  local\nresources. However, the response to the new system has so far been shaky.\nLocal governments do not have enough understanding of the decentralized\nsystem of public services (see Dwiyanto 2003, pages 88\u201389). Local corruption\nis also on the rise. Therefore, developing a curriculum based on local resources\nis still a serious challenge. In addition, there are many self-governing districts,\neach one consisting of different social, economic, and cultural backgrounds.\nA program that works well in one district may not succeed in others. Before\nthe program can be conducted, it is necessary to assess the diversity of problems,\nneeds, and local natural resources, and suit the curriculum content and method\nof implementation to those needs and resources.\n\nConclusion\n\nNatural  resources  management  in  Indonesia  is  characterized  by\ndisharmony  between  national  or  local  government,  the  private  sector,  and\ncivil society. The causes of the disharmony are multifaceted. However, the\nmain  cause  is  the  improper  role  of  government  in  building  a  system  for\nresponding  to  externalities  resulting  from  the  extractive  activities  of\ncorporations. The externalities are largely detrimental to the ecosystem and\nlocal community, and engender conflicts. This circumstance is exacerbated\nby  asymmetric  information  and  rent  seeking. To  provoke  less  conflict,\ncorporations limit the disclosure of information about the extraction process\nand its impact. And, while there are regulations to control the extraction, they\ndo not work properly because of rent seeking. Government therefore cannot\ncontrol the externalities.\n\nThe shift from a centralized to a decentralized system of government has\nnot  significantly  improved  the  government  response  to  these  externalities.\nLocal governments are not well positioned vis-\u00e0-vis the private sector and civil\nsociety to implement an adequate response. Motivated mainly by the need to\ngenerate local revenues, they do not concern themselves with environmental\nproblems  and  their  long-term  consequences. Therefore,  they  do  not  take\nsignificant action to improve the ecosystem even as environmental degradation\nand  natural  resource  conflicts  arise  in  many  places. The  same  can  be  said\nabout the corporations that create the environmental problems. They carry\nout CSR programs to minimize the environmental damage and conflicts, but\nthe programs, for various reasons including complicity with local officials, do\nnot contribute substantially to lessening the degradation.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n485\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f486\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nThese  facts  show  that  government  is  not  equipped  to  administer  the\ntrade-off  between  economic  growth  and  environmental  protection.  It\nemphasizes  natural  resources  extraction,  often  to  the  detriment  of\nenvironmental protection. The corporations, for their part, extract natural\nresources but do not restore the ecosystem or compensate the local people for\nthe externalities. In short, both government and the private sector concentrate\non high economic performance but do not pay enough attention to the future\nof the environment and society (Sumarto 2005, page 15).\n\nCivil society must take the initiative to build collective awareness of the\nimportance of natural resources. A more environmentally conscious society\ncan control political behavior and management of natural resources extraction,\nand ensure better governance and environmental sustainability.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n486\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fThe Proper Role of Government in Natural Resources Management in Indonesia\n\n487\n\nReferences\n\nAman. 2002.

Also on the increase are public complaints\nabout difficulties in measuring government\u2019s performance, about diverse and\ncontradictory objectives, unreliable measurement tools, and the unwillingness\nof governments to invest resources in new management techniques.\n\nIn Malaysia, Prime Minister Dato\u2019 Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi has\nvoiced increasing skepticism of activity-based measures of performance and\nthe need to see evidence that public agency investments in personnel, training,\nequipment, and space are indeed improving the lives of those served. This has\nresulted in a dramatic push among public service delivery agencies to develop\noutcome-based  indicators  of  agency  performance  both  within  and  outside\nthe realm of public governance.\n\nWhile difficulties undoubtedly exist, the vast amount of literature suggests\nthat performance-based management is an advanced public governance tool\nthat is becoming more and more sophisticated to accommodate the service\nneeds of different communities and levels of government ranging from public\nsafety  and  public  works  to  economic  development.  Performance-based\nmanagement is management that defines and measures agency success through\nthe achievement of desired changes in the behavior or conditions of citizens\nserved,  at  an  acceptable  cost.  Performance-based  management  ties  agency\nprogram  and  treatment  functions  directly  to  citizen  outcomes\u2014the  only\nmeaningful criterion for agency success.\n\nLocal Organizational Capacity for Public Service Delivery\n\nThere are two major criteria for assessing the quality of any service delivery\nsystem. One is a measure of efficiency, or the ability of the system to deliver\n\n1 Deputy Director, Centre for Policy Research, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n489\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f490\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nservices to the greatest number of people at the lowest cost. In this approach,\nmeasures of the processes or activities performed by an agency, such as the\nnumber  of  people  served  or  the  number  of  units  of  service  provided,  are\ncollected and examined in relation to the costs associated with the delivery.\nUntil  recently,  services  were  largely  managed  to  optimize  efficiency. Thus,\nmanagement information or reporting systems collected data to report on the\nquantity of services offered and the use of those services by eligible people in\nthe community.\n\nA second way of assessing the quality of service is through measures of\neffectiveness. In this approach, measures of the outcomes generated by agency\nactivities  or  the  results  achieved  by  those  served  are  collected.  Thus,\neffectiveness-based management strategies are designed to promote knowledge,\nattitudes, or behavior that reflects significant changes in the people who are\nserved, such that program success is defined by these results rather than by the\nprocesses  that  produce  them. This  management  approach  is  referred  to  as\n\u201cresults-oriented management\u201d or \u201cperformance-based management.\u201d\n\nThe  focus  of  a  performance-based  management  program  is  on  the\noutcomes to be achieved rather than the activities to be developed and provided.\nActivities are only means to ends not ends in themselves. Everything that is\ndone,  and  every  dedicated  resource,  is  devoted  to  accomplishing  clear-cut\noutcome goals that can be measured and demonstrated. Thus, in this context,\nindicators of agency activities are useful only to the extent that they are tied to\nresults. While this sounds obvious on the surface, it marks a very significant\nchange in the way most service programs operate. We often think in terms of\nthe outcomes of our activities rather than the activities that are necessary to\nproduce the outcomes.\n\nA performance-driven public service delivery system is developed and\nimplemented in several steps. First, the key client or customer groups that are\nto be served and their specific needs are identified. Then the organizational\n(community) and client outcomes that must be achieved are defined as clearly\nas possible; these reflect the client needs that are being met and the community\nobjectives being addressed. Outcomes are chosen because they are highly valued\nand desired by the community and they reflect an area in which an agency can\nhave an impact. Once these outcomes are defined, it is important to identify\nthe types of activities that can be directly related to the specified outcomes. In\nthis  type  of  system  the  focus  shifts  from  activity-based  accountability  to\naccountability for outcomes.\n\nThe following case study demonstrates the experience of Malaysia\u2019s largest\nmunicipality  (in  surface  area),  Seberang  Perai,  in  involving  citizens  in  the\ndevelopment  of  community  outcome-based  performance  measures  to\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n490\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fBuilding a Performance-based Management System\n\n491\n\ninstitutionalize a performance-based management system for their municipal\ncouncil.\n\nIdentification of Performance Measures by Citizens:\nThe Seberang Perai Experience (A Case Study)\n\nBackground\n\nIn  mid-2001,  the  Seberang  Perai  Municipal  Council,  or  Majlis\nPerbandaran  Seberang  Perai  (MPSP),  commissioned  the  Centre  for  Policy\nResearch, Universiti Sains Malaysia, to create a process that would lead to\nfundamental decisions and actions by which the diverse citizenry of Seberang\nPerai could achieve what they wanted to achieve collectively as a community.\nThe 18-month strategic planning project, called Project Research In Strategic\nManagement (PRISM),2  was based on the premise that involving citizens in\nthe development of performance measures would give them another avenue\nbeyond traditional means to affect municipal decision making. In addition,\nthrough  PRISM,  the  municipal  council  hoped  to  improve  the  quality  of\ndecision making and service delivery with the help of the citizens\u2019 perspectives.\nThe following were the performance-based specific goals of the PRISM project:\n\n(cid:127) To  assist  the  Seberang  Perai  Municipal  Council  in  establishing  a\nsustainable  process  of  involving  citizens\u2019  representatives,  executive\nboard members of the municipal council, and department staff in\ndeveloping  performance  measures,  to  give  greater  credibility  to\nperformance measurement and to guide the municipal government\nin improving public services; and\n\n(cid:127) To  set  up  a  dialogue  between  the  citizens  and  the  municipal\nadministration  about  the  functions  and  responsibilities  of  the\nmunicipal government and its public service priorities, to make elected\nand  nonelected  (appointed)  officials  more  sensitive  to  citizens\u2019\nperspectives, and more accountable to the public.\n\nThe state of Pulau Pinang, popularly known as Penang, consists of two\ndistinct parts: the island of Penang and the mainland province of Seberang\nPerai. Seberang Perai province is divided into three districts of about equal\nsize\u2014North  Seberang  Perai,  Central  Seberang  Perai,  and  South  Seberang\n\n2 The principal consultants of the PRISM project were Dr. Suhaimi Shahnon, deputy director of the\nCentre for Policy Research (CPR), Universiti Sains Malaysia, and Dr. Kamarudin Ngah, associate\nprofessor and coordinator of the Program for Local Government Studies (PROLOGS) in CPR.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n491\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f492\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nPerai\u2014each of which is managed by a district officer.

Phase 1, which was\ncompleted in the first quarter of 2002, focused on building the process of\ncitizen involvement, selecting service areas, developing performance measures,\nand  making  those  measures  known  to  the  general  public,  elected  political\nofficials in the three districts, and appointed executive board members and\ndepartment staff of the municipal council. This case study documents the\naccomplishments of Phase 1 and summarizes the lessons learned.\n\nPhase 1 Activities\n\nStep 1: The first step was to create a Citizen Performance Team (CPT)\nin  each  precinct  identified  by  the  district  officers.  The  CPT  comprised\ncitizens, representatives of the municipal council executive board, and key\nmanagers of the municipal council\u2019s administration. The citizens came from\ndiverse backgrounds. Some were members of neighborhood watches or of\nvarious ethnic community boards. There were also businessmen, ordinary\ncitizens  (including  housewives,  self-employed,  and  trained  unemployed),\nand leaders of inner-city, suburban, and village communities. Two of the\nmembers  represented  departments  of  the  municipal  council  and  were\nexpected  to  provide  service-specific  information  to  the  CPT.  Figure  1\nillustrates the CPT concept.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n492\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fBuilding a Performance-based Management System\n\n493\n\nFigure 1: The Citizen Performance Team\n\nMunicipal Council \nExecutive Board \n\nCitizenry \n\nMunicipal Council \nAdministrative Staff \n\n2 members \n\nMajority \n\n2 members \n\nCitizen Performance Team \n\nSolicit citizen \ninput about \nperceivable \noutcomes of \npublic services \n\nDevelop \nperformance \nmeasures \nbased on \ncitizen input \n\nCollect \nperformance \ndata \n\nWith municipal \nofficials, use \ncitizen-initiated \nperformance \nmeasures in \ndecision \nmaking \n\nAssist \nmunicipal \nofficials in \npublicizing \nperformance \nmeasurement \ninformation \n\nStep  2:  The  CPTs  then  went  through  two  exercises  to  gain  a  better\nunderstanding of the process. They were asked to identify key groups in their\nrespective precincts that should either be part of the CPT or be informed\nabout the functions and results of the CPT\u2019s work.

Citizens in different precincts\nhad  different  community  concerns  and  priorities,  and  therefore  tended  to\nselect different services.\n\nCitizens in the Butterworth precinct, an industrial precinct facing many\neconomic challenges, decided to evaluate public security and public safety\nservices because of their highly visible and immediate impact on daily life.\nCitizens in the Bukit Mertajam precinct selected emergency medical services\nand public security services, not because of significantly growing demand for\nthese services but because suburban families, especially those with children,\nwere genuinely concerned about response time, given the geographic spread\nof  the  precinct.  Citizens  in  Kepala  Batas  picked  recreational  facilities  and\nservices because quality of life was an important issue in the precinct\u2019s effort\nto sustain economic development and retain the younger population. Citizens\nin Seberang Jaya selected engineering or public works (especially street) services,\npartly  because  many  of  the  citizens  had  to  travel  daily  to  work  in  nearby\ncentral cities, and were therefore more concerned about traffic flow and the\nquality of street repairs and maintenance. Citizens in Perai also selected public\nworks but for a different reason: they noted that a significant share of the\nprecinct\u2019s funds was going to public works, and wanted to ensure efficient\nand  effective  public  spending.  Finally,  citizens  in  Nibong Tebal  and  Jawi\nprecincts decided to evaluate community development at the neighborhood\nlevel, where there were significant differences in the quality of life; the citizens\nwere eager to see a visible improvement in some neighborhoods.\n\nEach precinct-CPT identified \u201ccritical elements\u201d for the selected services.\nThese elements are summarized in Table 2 and discussed in the boxed text\nafter it. Many of these\u2014such as reducing the crime rate; lowering the response\ntime for police, fire, and emergency medical services; improving the safety\nand quality of recreational facilities; increasing the timeliness of response and\neffectiveness in nuisance control and solid waste removal\u2014have long been\nidentified  as  important  issues  in  the  literature  on  performance-based\nmanagement (see, for example, Hatry et al. 1992 and Campbell 1997).\n\nStep 4: The next step was for the CPTs to develop performance measures\nbased on the critical elements they identified. Professionals guided the CPT\nmembers through the unfamiliar task of thinking up different performance\nmeasures. Then the CPT members evaluated their own suggestions, using a\nworksheet that the PRISM project team had developed (see Appendix 1). The\nworksheet proved to be extremely useful; it helped the citizens identify those\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n494\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fBuilding a Performance-based Management System\n\n495\n\nTable 2: Critical Elements of Public Services Identified by Seberang Perai Citizens\n\nPublic Service\nPublic Security and\nPublic Safety\n\nEmergency Medical\nServices\n\nRecreational\nPrograms for Youth\nand Adults\n\nCommunity\nDevelopment and\nNeighborhood\nServices\n\nPublic Works,\nStreet Construction,\nRepairs, and\nMaintenance\n\nCritical Elements\n\nLegal knowledge and compliance; effective identification of problems;\nadequacy of training; response time; public relations; communication of\nprogress on a case to citizens after the case is filed; professionalism in\ninteracting with citizens; citizens\u2019 perception of competence; citizens\u2019 trust\nin the municipal council\u2019s enforcement officers; visibility of enforcement\nofficers in residential and school areas; timely follow-up; effective\ninvestigation; effectiveness of crime prevention programs; reduction in\ncrime rate; prevention of loss of property and life; insurance costs; public\nrelations; proper certification and professional standards.\n\nResponse time; quality of staff and volunteers; adequacy of professional\ntraining; adequacy of personnel and equipment; professionalism in\ninteraction with citizens.\n\nAvailability of programs to different user groups; diversity of programs;\nquality of day care; effectiveness of marketing; adequacy of space;\nconvenient hours; adequate maintenance of facilities and equipment;\nmotivating and effective instructors; success in drawing attendance; a\nwelcoming environment; security; reasonable cost; convenient location.\n\nTimeliness and effectiveness in crowd control, noise control, mosquito\ncontrol; removal or renovation of abandoned buildings; clearance of illegal\ndumps; clearance of graffiti and illegal billboards and sale signs; trimming\nof trees and bushes from sidewalks; cleanliness of streets; maintenance of\nstreetlights; solid waste collection and disposal; maintenance of public\nhousing.

How a department communicates the process and results to the public is\nimportant to citizens, and they want to measure this. This is especially important in public works and\npublic safety services. In the precinct-CPT meetings, citizens often complained that after filing a case\nwith a department, they heard nothing more from the department and were left to wonder about the\nprogress of work on the case and its results.\n\nInteraction between citizens and public officials is also critical. Effectiveness in resolving a grievance\nor providing services is definitely important. However, citizens also care about \u201ccustomer service\u201d\nand want to ensure professional, courteous, and evenhanded delivery of services and interaction with\ncitizens during the process. This is often mentioned in connection with almost all services (Blodgett\nand Newfarmer 1996).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n495\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f496\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nsuggestions that were not reasonably measurable, valid, or useful to the general\npublic. The  list  of  suggested  performance  measures  was  thus  significantly\nreduced, and data collection was made more manageable for the project team.\n\nKey Findings\n\nMany of the suggested measures were not significantly different from\nthose identified in professional publications on performance measurement.\nSeveral findings should, however, be pointed out:\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127) The  citizens  were  generally  more  concerned  about  outcome  and\nintermediate outcome measures (see Appendix 2 for a brief definition)\nthan input or output measures; however, some input measures were\nstill useful and recommended. For example, many citizens in different\nprecincts were interested in knowing the types and length of training\nreceived by public security and public safety enforcers and emergency\nmedical personnel, even though this is an input measure.\nPerformance measurement should not ignore equity concerns. For\nexample, citizens in the Kepala Batas precinct suggested measuring\nthe accessibility of recreational facilities and services to low-income\nfamilies. Citizens in the Nibong Tebal precinct were also concerned\nabout the accessibility of recreational programs to different age groups\nand the physically challenged.\nSurprisingly, not many citizens were interested in efficiency measures.\nThis  might  have  been  because  citizens  were  not  asked  during  the\nCPT discussions to consider performance measurement in the context\nof  budgeting.  Hence,  they  were  primarily  concerned  about  the\noutcome of services rather than output.\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127) The precincts in the PRISM project were advised to measure and\nreport  performance  not  only  at  the  precinct  level  but  also  at  the\nneighborhood or even street level, so that the information would be\nmore relevant and useful to citizens. Department staff of the municipal\ncouncil, especially information management personnel, were asked\nto take this need into account in designing their performance-based\nmanagement system database.\n\n(cid:127) Many of the measures suggested require citizen surveys to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of public services. Hence, municipal administrators\nshould  integrate  citizen  survey  strategies  into  performance\nmeasurement  so  that  the  information  can  be  made  available  for\nperformance  reporting.  User  surveys  are  an  alternative  means  of\ngathering data on many effectiveness and outcome measures. These\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n496\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fBuilding a Performance-based Management System\n\n497\n\nsurveys can be quite short. For instance, a small response card with\nseveral  questions  can  be  very  effective  in  gathering  this  type  of\nperformance information (Ammons 1995).\n\nIn  addition  to  developing  performance  measures,  each  precinct-CPT\nidentified  ways  of  informing  the  public  as  well  as  the  municipal  council\nexecutive board members and administrative staff about their work. All of the\nprecincts  in  the  PRISM  project  planned  to  have  one  or  more  citizen\nrepresentatives make a presentation to the municipal council about the PRISM\nprocess and outcomes.\n\nEvaluation of the Seberang Perai Experience\n\nThe seven Seberang Perai precincts in the PRISM project provided an\ninteresting  experimental  setting  to  test  the  feasibility  of  citizen-initiated\nperformance measurement. PRISM\u2019s Phase 1 experience showed that there\nmay not be a \u201cstandard\u201d procedure or a \u201cone size fits all\u201d process. All the seven\nprecincts developed performance measures; however, the processes used differed\nbetween precincts. In some precincts (Kepala Batas and Seberang Jaya), the\nCPT members wanted to help put the performance measures in writing. In\nButterworth, Perai, and Bukit Mertajam, the CPT members wanted to help\ndetermine  whether  the  measures  suggested  by  citizens  were  valid  and\nmeasurable, and to help modify the measures. In Nibong Tebal and Jawi, the\nCPT members were a bit more passive. They preferred to be involved merely\nin identifying the critical factors and to leave the PRISM project team and\ncouncil officials to decide which measures addressed these factors. They also\nasked  the  PRISM  project  team  members  to  provide  examples  from  other\nprecincts so that the suggested measures could be modified.\n\nAs the experience in these seven precincts showed, how a precinct handled\nthe process depended on how much the citizens knew about performance\nmeasurement in their private jobs or in their previous public services; how\ncomfortable they felt about writing down specific measures; how much time\nthey  were  willing  to  spend  in  meetings;  and  how  much  trust  they  had  in\nmunicipal council officials or external consultants.\n\nKey Success Factors and Challenges\n\nIn general, Phase 1 of the PRISM project was a success in the following\n\nways:\n\n(cid:127) The creation of effective, working CPTs with citizens, elected political\nofficials,  and  municipal  council  executive  board  members  and\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n497\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f498\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nadministrative  staff  working  together  to  develop  performance\nmeasures. Municipal council officials and staff did not dominate, as\nsome at first thought they might; in fact, the officials and staff were\nvery deferential to the citizens and willingly answered the questions\nthey raised. Most of the CPTs not only asked sound, clear questions\nbut also asked to tour facilities, review internal reports and information\non performance criteria used in the municipal council, and analyze\ncommunity survey data.\n\n(cid:127) The identification of critical elements and related performance measures.\nThe  process  of  identifying  critical  elements  was  very  effective  in\nproviding  a  context  for  citizens  to  develop  performance  measures.\nBreaking the selected service area into critical factors allowed the citizens\nto express what they felt to be the important aspects of a service and\nsubsequently develop performance measures based on these aspects.\n(cid:127) The strengthening of communication between government and the\ncitizens. The measures suggested by the CPTs were similar to those\ndeveloped by professional or national organizations, but adapted to\nthe local context. The CPTs also put greater emphasis on methods of\ninforming the public. The citizens in all seven Seberang Perai precincts\nin the PRISM project felt a great need to let the citizens know what\nthe municipal council was doing, how effectively this was being done,\nand what follow-up actions had been taken on the citizens\u2019 opinions\nand complaints. This was somewhat of a surprise for the municipal\ncouncil officials and staff, who had thought all along that they were\ncommunicating  effectively  with  the  citizens.  Both  the  municipal\ncouncil  and  the  district  offices  are  now  reexamining  their\ncommunication strategies.\n\nThe project also faced some challenges. The most significant one was\nsustaining citizen involvement. School holidays saw a drop-off in involvement\nin six of the seven precincts. There was some improvement after the holidays\nbut not to the original level of the early stages. This issue was identified by\nPRISM project team members, municipal council officials and staff, and CPT\nmembers as needing attention.\n\nThe PRISM project team plans to survey CPT members who did not\nremain hopeful about the process, to understand and, if necessary, modify the\nproject  approach.  One  factor  that  may  have  contributed  to  the  loss  of\nconfidence was the protracted formation of the precinct-CPTs after the key\ngroups were identified. The CPTs had to be reoriented many times and this\nfurther slowed the assessment of public services.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n498\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fBuilding a Performance-based Management System\n\n499\n\nA  second  major  challenge  was  the  weak  response  of  the  media. The\nmunicipal council and the PRISM project team were disappointed in their\nefforts to attract media coverage. As a result, the CPTs were unable to achieve\nwider public involvement in the performance measurement process.\n\nAnother challenge was specific to the precinct of Bukit Mertajam. The\ninitial  CPT  identified  was  somewhat  dysfunctional  and  had  difficulty\nidentifying  target  service  areas.  Some  members  wanted  to  use  the  PRISM\nproject to debate municipal government policies. On the positive side, CPT\nmembers decided to survey the various neighborhoods themselves. They also\nheld a precinct-wide meeting to gather information. The CPT members thus\ngot  a  clearer  sense  of  which  public  service  areas  had  to  have  performance\nmeasures.  The  very  active  involvement  of  an  elected  opposition  state\nassemblyman in the CPT contributed as well to reviving the Bukit Mertajam\nprocess. It sent a strong signal that the precinct was committed to the process.\nFinally, citizens, like professionals and elected political officials, struggled\nto identify outcome measures. Many could not tell the difference between\noutput  and  outcome  measures.  Indeed,  some  measures,  such  as  citizens\u2019\nsatisfaction  with  a  public  service  or  citizens\u2019  participation  in  municipal\nprograms, are not necessarily outcome or output measures. The Urban Institute\ncalls  these  measures  \u201cintermediate  outcome  measures\u201d  (Hatry  1999).\nProfessional  assistance  in  this  process  is  therefore  definitely  necessary  and\nhelpful.\n\nOverall, the experience in Phase 1 of the PRISM project in Seberang\nPerai was positive. The project demonstrated that a CPT consisting of citizens,\nmunicipal council executive board members, and key administrators of the\nmunicipal  council  can  function  effectively  together.  It  also  showed  that  if\nelected political officials and municipal council executive board members are\ncommitted, that commitment sends a strong signal to citizens that the PRISM\napproach will make a difference in municipal decision making. Also, the fact\nthat the process is transparent to all parties allayed skepticism and the fear\nthat one party would manipulate the process.\n\nCase Study Conclusion\n\nTraditionally,  performance  measurement  has  been  an  exercise  for\nmunicipal  government  managers  and  budgeting  officials.  However,  many\nmeasures developed internally by municipal council staff may not reflect the\nconcerns  and  priorities  of  citizens. The  PRISM  project  in  Seberang  Perai\ndemonstrated the feasibility of engaging citizens in developing performance\nmeasures. It also proved that the process can be done in such a way as to give\nvalue to citizens and the municipal council.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n499\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f500\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nWhile it may be premature to make any conclusion about the long-term\nimpact of the project, several lessons have been learned. First, the PRISM\nproject  helped  the  Seberang  Perai  Municipal  Council  focus  on  outcome\nmeasures and citizens\u2019 concerns. This should enhance public accountability\nand the result-orientation of public services. Second, the PRISM project showed\nthe importance of public communication. For example, any government agency\nshould  not  neglect  to  notify  citizens  about  the  progress  or  results  of\ndepartmental actions after a service request is filed. Third, municipal council\nadministrators should prepare for comparative performance measurement, as\nmany  citizens  are  interested  in  knowing  how  well  their  municipality  is\nperforming  relative  to  its  neighbors.  Fourth,  many  performance  measures\nshould be reported at the neighborhood level to make them more relevant to\ncitizens. Finally, public reporting of performance measurement is important.\nLocal authorities should consider the use of technologies, such as the Internet,\nto do this cost-effectively.\n\nThe Seberang Perai Municipal Council continues to collect data for the\nmeasures identified by the CPTs, and disseminate the results to the general\npublic. Several precincts in the PRISM project have indicated a desire to expand\nthe project and add new public service areas for performance measurement.\nOther precincts have indicated the desire to join the project in the near future.\nThe  outlook  is  optimistic  for  citizens  becoming  an  effective  partner  in\ndeveloping and using agency performance measures.\n\nDeveloping a Performance-based Management System\n\nThe performance-based management strategy adopted in the Seberang\nPerai Municipal Council through the PRISM project should result in more\ndefensible and accountable public service. It should also result in public services\ndesigned  to  produce  relevant  community  outcomes  and  provide  a  set  of\nindicators  that  will  keep  agency  activities  accountable  for  these  outcomes.\nAnother potential benefit is that the indicators selected to monitor agency\nperformance  will  be  directly  related  to  measures  of  agency  effectiveness\nproviding  the  kind  of  ongoing  justification  needed  to  support  continued\nfunding in a time of scarce resources. The agency\u2019s executive board members\nand managerial staff should also see this type of system as promoting more\neffective links to other agencies and better cooperation with other agencies in\naccomplishing outcomes for which they are jointly responsible.\n\nThe performance-based management model put into operation in the\nPRISM  project  for  the  Seberang  Perai  Municipal  Council  carried  out  the\nfollowing actions:\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n500\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fBuilding a Performance-based Management System\n\n501\n\n(cid:127) Action 1: Identify the citizens to be served, and their problems and\nneeds that must be addressed. This first action is to clearly state the\ntarget of a service and the specific problems or needs that justify a\npotential service program or policy intervention. While a primary\nintervention program may target an entire community, it is best to\nacknowledge  that  certain  people  in  the  community  are  at  greatest\nrisk of having a particular problem or challenge in their lives, and\nthat these are the people who are most likely to need the service. We\nasked ourselves: Who are the people most likely to have a particular\nproblem? Who are the people most likely to need help in a particular\npart of their lives? What are some of the prevailing conditions in their\nlives that make it likely that they will be at risk of some condition\nthat  may  require  intervention?  What  are  the  specific  needs  that\nprevious  research  or  other  evidence  suggests  these  individuals  or\nfamilies have?\n\n(cid:127) Action  2:  Identify  the  community  outcomes  to  be  achieved. This\naction is a significant leap forward in thinking about the kinds of\nsystem-level results that should be achieved by addressing the problems\nand needs of the citizens. In other words, how would the community\nbe different if people\u2019s needs were truly addressed or their problems\nsignificantly reduced? What benefits would the system itself find so\ndesirable that it would invest significantly in interventions to achieve\noutcomes that it can value and support? In a public setting, what\nkinds of outcomes would taxpayers be willing to support to achieve\nthese outcomes?\nThese  outcomes  must  be  carefully  defined  and  defensible.  While\ncommunity  outcomes  are  often  influenced  by  many  factors,  they\nshould  be  logical  consequences  of  an  agency\u2019s  efforts  to  solve  the\nproblems and needs of the potential client population. The desired\noutcomes should also be few in number, stated in nontechnical terms,\nand easily understood within and outside the public service agency\n(Ammons 2000).\n\n(cid:127) Action  3:  Identify  the  agency  outputs  (see  Appendix  2  for  a  brief\ndefinition) that can be directly related to the community outcomes.\nThese  agency  outputs  are  those  for  which  an  agency  is  primarily\nresponsible and that have clear ties to the outcomes or benefits the\nagency wants to achieve for its people. Agency outputs are referred to\nin Total Quality Management literature as \u201ccritical success variables\u201d\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n501\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f502\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nor \u201ccritical success factors.\u201d These are the agency outcomes that, if\nachieved, will have the greatest chance of ensuring that the individual,\nfamily, or community outcomes will occur. The critical agency outputs\nsend  a  very  clear  message  about  how  agency  performance  will  be\nmeasured.\nThere are many potential outcomes of agency activities, but critical\noutputs are what the agency wants to be directed toward and measured\nagainst. Usually, agency outputs like these are defined on the basis of\na careful review of research evidence or policy evaluation results or, in\ntheir absence, clear logic. Ultimately, good agency output indicators\nshould be few in number, easily understood, related directly to agency\nactivities, and worded in such a way that the service population is the\ngroup for whom the results are to be achieved.\n\n(cid:127) Action 4: Define the agency activities likely to produce each desired\ncommunity  outcome.  Agency  activities  are  designed  to  produce\noutcomes  instead  of  responding  directly  to  client  needs.  In\nperformance-based management, activities are oriented forward, to\nresults, rather than backward, to either citizen or agency needs. This\ntype of performance management model supports only those activities\nwhose probable impact on results can be clearly defined. All too often,\nagencies develop shotgun-type activities that attempt to \u201cbe everything\nto everybody.\u201d When this happens, the scope of activities ranges from\nthe effective to the ineffective, and the overall results are often mixed\nat best or completely unknown.\nActivity  measures  in  a  performance  system  are  directly  related  to\nspecific community outcomes and the responsible agency is now the\n\u201cactor\u201d in the information system. But only those agency activities\nthat can be directly related to community outcomes are measured.\nFor  example,  simple  counts  of  people  served  are  to  be  avoided  in\nfavor of the percentage of the target population that is reached. The\nlatter is a much better indicator of whether the program is likely to\nproduce outcomes for the target population. The focus here is on\nactivities that are specifically targeted toward community outcomes,\nand only a limited number of measures of activity are necessary to\ngauge performance in relation to intended results (Ammons 1996).\n\n(cid:127) Action  5:  Acquire,  allocate,  and  manage  resources  to  accomplish\ncritical agency activities. This step refers to program planning, fiscal\nmanagement, and budget allocation and analysis. If the activities are\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n502\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fBuilding a Performance-based Management System\n\n503\n\naccomplished according to the performance management criteria, the\ndirect or indirect contribution of all resources to those activities that\nare  designed  to  support  specific  community  outcomes  should  be\nmeasurable. In management terms, this is referred to as the activity-\nbased  costing,  or  ABC,  model. The  proportional  contribution  of\nactivities to outcomes should also be measurable, such that the cost-\neffectiveness of each activity can be defined. The overall model allows\nfor a \u201creturn on investment\u201d analysis in which outcomes or benefits\ncan then be attributed to specific activities and costs, thereby justifying\nthe intervention within a formal accountability structure.\n\n(cid:127) Action 6: Monitor agency performance indicators. The performance-\nbased measurement program described in the Seberang Perai case study\nabove established a set of key indicators at several levels that can be\nused  to  assess  agency  performance.  All  of  the  indicators  can  be\nmeasured  in  a  way  that  clearly  justifies  program  operations. The\noutcome indicators (see Appendix 2 for the outcome matrix) that are\nneeded are the following:\n\n-\n\n- Knowledge: these indicate improvements in the level of knowledge\nthat are necessary to operate effectively in the area of concern of\nthe agency.\nAttitudes: these include perceptions or beliefs that are considered\nimportant in achieving desired outcomes or that reflect outcomes\nconsidered necessary by the agency for optimum performance.\nBehavior: these are specific behaviors or activities that should occur\nif the program has been effective or that the community deems\nnecessary on the part of some portion of its people.\n\n-\n\n- Cost-effectiveness:  these  results  should  indicate  that  the  benefits\nderived from the intervention are worth the costs or investments\nmade in the delivery of those benefits.\n\n(cid:127) Action  7:  Evaluate  citizen-initiated  outcomes  and  measure  the\nagency\u2019s  impact  on  those  outcomes. The  final  step  in  building  a\nperformance-based  management  system  is  the  periodic  and\ncomprehensive  assessment  of  the  extent  to  which  citizen  and\ncommunity outcomes are achieved by the services delivered by the\nagency.  All  too  often,  this  step  is  ignored  and  the  results  of\ninterventions  are  unknown.  Without  evaluation,  service  agencies\noften \u201cshoot in the dark\u201d with no real data to determine how well\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n503\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f504\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nthey are meeting their mark and achieving the intended results for\nwhich they are funded.\nAny intervention should be continually evaluated. Agencies should\ncontinually improve the intended outcomes in knowledge, attitudes,\nbehavior, and cost-effectiveness. Without evaluation, there is no way\nto tell if one intervention is better than another or if one works better\nwith one target population than with another. Furthermore, lack of\ngood  and  ongoing  evaluation  leads  to  public  mistrust  of  human\nservices and overreliance on anecdotal or exceptional case data to justify\nan agency\u2019s operations. When there is no shortage of funds, this type\nof justification is sometimes adequate, but when funds are tight, fuzzy\ndata  are  usually  insufficient  to  justify  continued  support.\nUnfortunately, this means that the agencies that do not have good\nperformance indicators and outcomes suffer in the competition for\nscarce dollars (Ammons 2000).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n504\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fBuilding a Performance-based Management System\n\n505\n\nReferences\n\nAllen, J.

Consultative Mechanism to Improve\nGovernance\n\nHashim Yaacob1\n\nNorma Mansor2\n\nIntroduction\n\nConsultation  has  become  part  and  parcel  of  the  government  policy\nmaking and planning framework in Malaysia today. Although the types of\nconsultation vary from policy to policy, most public policies went through\nsome kind of discussion at various levels, involving relevant groups in the\nsociety depending on the issue. The latest is the draft of the Malaysian Specific\nCreative Commons Licenses, which was discussed in October 2005. Together\nwith the Multimedia Development Corporation (a public agency), the Law\nFaculty  of  the  University  of  Malaya  held  a  public  discussion  and  invited\nprofessionals and members of the public to voice their opinions on the draft.\nThe  Government  is  planning  to  legislate  an  alternative  to  the  traditional\ncopyright approach of \u201cAll rights reserved\u201d: \u201cOnly some rights reserved.\u201d Other\ndialogues include those held by the Ministry of Finance (on the annual budget\nfor 2005), the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and the Central\nBank of Malaysia (an annual dialogue). Certain government ministries and\nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) have also held forums to get inputs\nfor the Ninth Malaysia Five-Year Development Plan for 2006\u20132010.\n\nEngagement with a wider group of the society outside the government\nbureaucracy in Malaysia is premised on three main factors: historical ethnic\nrelations, which were essentially based on negotiations and bargaining; the\nprevailing view in the 1980s that the private sector was more efficient than\nthe public sector; and the desirability of including the private sector and NGOs\nin policy making because it would also legitimize government policies.\n\n1 Vice-Chancellor, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n2 Dean, Department of Economics and Administration, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n508\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fEngaging Societies: Institutionalizing a Consultative Mechanism to Improve Governance\n\n509\n\nHistory of Consultation: Political Bargaining\n\nThe  political,  economic,  and  administrative  milieu  of  the  country  is\nshaped  by  the  pluralistic  nature  of  Malaysian  society.  Malaysia\u2019s  political\nexperience  is  one  of  achieving  consensus  between  ethnic  groups. Though\ncompromises were inevitable in reaching an agreement, each group worked to\noptimize its interests. Consensus building started with the independence, or\nmerdeka, framework, for which the three main ethnic groups had to draw a\nworkable governing formula. This can be regarded as a consultative process in\na limited sense, as the three main ethnic groups were represented by their\nleaders. The coalition formed, known as the Alliance Party and later renamed\nthe National Front, won the elections after independence and has been ruling\npost-independence Malaysia since then.\n\nIndependence, however, did not translate into a better standard of living\nfor all, especially among the majority Malays (bumiputra). The growth strategy\nadopted  by  the  Government  in  the  1950s  and  1960s  had  limited  success,\nresulting  in  rising  inequalities  within  and  between  ethnic  groups.  Income\ninequalities between ethnic groups, economic sectors, and regions were made\nworse by rising unemployment (8%) and underemployment despite a growing\neconomy. The sole emphasis on growth was inevitably reviewed in the wake\nof the racial riots in 1969.\n\nThe shift from growth, to growth with distribution, became the objective\nof the new development initiative called the New Economic Policy (NEP).\nThe NEP was launched in 1971 and eventually covered three decades. In its\nmission to eradicate poverty and restructure the society, the public sector had\nadopted a new role by getting directly involved in business. Hence, the role\nsomewhat blurred the regulatory function of the Government. It was further\ncomplicated when it was associated with ethnic domination, i.e., the public\nsector was Malay-dominated while the private sector was Chinese-dominated.\nHence, 10 years into the NEP period, there was a high level of mistrust\nbetween the private sector and the Government over the implementation of\nthe  second  prong  of  objectives  of  the  New  Economic  Policy,  i.e.,  the\nrestructuring of the society that had led to the proliferation of public enterprises.\nThe  establishment  public  enterprises,  seen  as  an  economic  vehicle  of  the\nGovernment to specifically address inequality between bumiputras and non-\nbumiputras and to reduce poverty, existed in almost all sectors, and were in\ndirect  competition  with  private  enterprises. The  perceived  \u201ccrowding  out\u201d\neffect had led to capital flight out of the country. There was dissatisfaction\nwith certain affirmative actions, including the Industrial Coordination Act\nmandating  30%  bumiputra  capital  participation  in  industrial  enterprises.\nMeanwhile, some public enterprises underperformed, and some of these public\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n509\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f510\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nenterprises were faced with management and financial problems. In addition,\nthere was growing disenchantment in the country with other public services.\nPolitical  and  economic  events  of  the  1980s  had  prompted  the\nGovernment  under  Mahathir  to  engage  the  private  sector,  academics,  and\nNGOs in policy making. There were at least three pertinent events during\nthis period. The first was the economic crisis in 1984, and the second was the\nend of the NEP period (1970\u20131990) and hence the formulation of a new\ndevelopment plan. The economic crisis of the mid-1980s was attributed to\nboth endogenous and exogenous factors. The world oil crisis caused by the\nIran-Iraq War triggered the economic recession. There were also issues in the\ndomestic economy that were unresolved. Chief among these was excessive\ninvestment in nonproductive sectors like the property sector by both the public\nand  the  private  sector. These  projects  were  financed  heavily  with  external\nborrowings, thus causing heavy government indebtedness.\n\nThe third event was a challenge to political leadership. Notably, this was\nnot an easy period at the national level politically: the leadership challenge\nhad led to the expulsion and de-registration of the main political party, United\nMalays National Organisation (UMNO), the backbone of the ruling party.\nThe opposing faction had formed a splinter party known as Semangat 46.\nThe power struggle caused a split among the government political parties, as\nit was a test of loyalty among partners and friends of more than 20 years. For\nUMNO, a party with a well-planned succession plan for leadership, this was\nunprecedented, as it signified strong dissatisfaction with the UMNO leadership.\nWith  the  scenario  mentioned  above  and  the  push  for  a  structural\nadjustment program by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank\nto liberalize the economy, and influenced by Thatcher-Reaganism wisdom,\nthe Government adopted a privatization policy. Private sector management\nwas seen to be superior to the public sector in delivering public services. Also,\nthe Government under then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad felt that a\nwider section of the community needed to be reached to address the negative\nperceptions of the Government, to manage the uncertainties in the country,\nand to seek solutions to the economic problems. A partnership formula through\nthe concept Malaysia Incorporated was therefore launched.\n\nConsultative Forums\n\nEconomic Forums\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nThe consultation with the private sector that was formalized through\nthe Interagency Planning Group started with the creation of the Malaysian\nIndustrial Group for High Technology to advise the Government in mapping\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n510\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fEngaging Societies: Institutionalizing a Consultative Mechanism to Improve Governance\n\n511\n\nout an industrial strategy and industrialization plan for the country. The group\nconsists of heads of industry and was created to identify the types of industries,\ntheir linkages, and their potential. Malaysia then embarked into heavy industry\nlike the steel and the automotive industries. This group remains relevant in\nadvising the Government on science and technology.\n\nThe  National  Economic  Consultative  Council  (NECC)  has  a  wider\nrepresentation  and  was  established  in  1986  to  frame  the  Second  Outline\nPerspective Plan (OPP 2). OPP2 was to replace the First OPP, which ended in\n1990. The OPP is a long and broad development plan that outlines national\npriorities and strategies. NECC members include central government agencies,\nthe ruling party, opposition parties, NGOs, and academics. Although some\nmembers have expressed concern on the lip-service treatment given to this\ncommittee, there has been a significant shift in emphasis in economic policy.\nThe most influential forum within the private sector, many say, would\nbe the Malaysian Business Council (MBC), which was launched in 1991 by\nformer Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. It is the main body supporting\nthe  Malaysia  Incorporated  program,  which  is  aimed  at  cooperation  and\ncollaboration between the public and private sectors for national development.\nThere are 72 members, including prominent industry leaders, several cabinet\nministers, senior government officials, and several members of NGOs. National\neconomic policies are the main agenda of the meetings, which cover topics\nranging from industrial and tax policies to trade and employment matters.\nAlthough the MBC meets infrequently, its working committees have already\nsubmitted 30 working papers to the Government. An important document,\nthe Privatization Master Plan, was drawn up in consultation with the private\nsector, particularly the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers.\n\n The Annual Budget Dialogue, in actual fact a pre-budget input gathering,\ndates back to the 1970s but was further modified when more organizations\nwere invited to systematically submit proposals. Organizations representing\nbusiness  associations,  NGOs,  trade  unions,  and  youth  organizations  were\nsubsequently invited to present their proposals to the finance minister. Many\nclaim that the dialogue is a significant way of presenting their issues to the\nGovernment. In addition, every ministry and state has a consultative panel to\nadvise on policies affecting them.\n\nThe National Economic Action Council became the main consultative\npanel when the country was faced with the 1997 economic crisis. This council\nof 26 members representing the private sector, NGOs, the academe, and think\ntanks  was  established  in  January  1998  with  a  twofold  objective:  to  gauge\nopinions and suggestions from the private sector, and to gain support for the\nGovernment\u2019s  effort  to  revive  the  economy.  The  council  advised  the\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n511\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f512\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nGovernment  on  a  suitable  policy  response  to  the  crisis  and  came  up  with\nsuggestions such as capital control and a fixed exchange rate.\n\nSocial Accountability Forums\n\nThe establishment of commissions, both outside and under parliament,\nwas  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  effort  to  promote  a  harmonious  society.\nComplaints about human rights abuses had caused the Government to establish\nthe  Malaysian  Human  Rights  Commission. This  commission  also  draws\nrepresentation  from  NGOs  and  prominent  persons  in  the  country. This\ncommission comes close to the function of an ombudsman, in the absence of\nthe latter.\n\nIn  response  to  complaints  of  corruption  among  the  police  force,  the\nGovernment set up the Royal Commission of Police to enhance the operation\nand management of the Royal Malaysian Police, according to the Commission\nof Inquiry Act of 1950. The members are again former senior government\nofficials,  former  judges,  NGOs,  and  the  academe.  Commission  members\nreported  that  they  were  given  autonomy  and  were  well  supported  by  the\nGovernment during the inquiry. Moreover, their report was released to the\npublic  within  a  fortnight  after  its  submission. The  transparent  manner  in\nwhich the inquiry was administered further legitimized the police force reform.\n There have been efforts by the Government to widen representation in\nthe management of public accountability. The Public Accounts Committee\n(PAC), which has traditionally been very much in the government domain\nand  somewhat  ineffective,  is  now  a  more  open  club  since  Prime  Minister\nAbdullah Ahmad Badawi took over the helm in 2003. The committee is elected\nat the beginning of each parliament with powers to audit a wide range of\ngovernment activities. The chairman is a backbencher of the ruling party and\nthe cochairman is a member of parliament from an opposition party. Members\nare from both the government and opposition parties. This is a step toward\ninclusion to bring about harmony.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusion\n\nAlthough it is difficult to conclude that there is a direct causal relation\nbetween social engagement and harmonious society, the forums have provided\nan avenue for government officials, private sector, academe, and NGOs to\nshare opinions and information with one another. These forums have served\nat least three purposes. First, they help to narrow the social gap in a racially\ndivided society, especially when the sectors are identified with race. The forums\nserve as an arena through which dissonance within each interest group can be\nexpressed, debated, and resolved behind closed doors. Second, the process\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n512\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\fEngaging Societies: Institutionalizing a Consultative Mechanism to Improve Governance\n\n513\n\ndraws  on  the  expert  knowledge,  insights,  and  judgment  of  leaders  in  the\ncommunity. This is one way of discerning risks associated with certain policy\ndirections and evaluating long-term implications. Finally, participation in these\npolicies  provides  the  members  with  a  sense  of  ownership  and  a  sense  of\ncommitment to the policies.\n\nThe effectiveness of these economic policies has contributed to decades\nof economic progress, despite the periodic difficulties. It is also worth noting\nthat  the  country  has  been  able  to  sustain  political  and  social  stability.\nTransparency in policy making has gained wide support from the public, as\ndemonstrated by their support for some radical economic policies taken by\nthe Government in response to the 1997 economic crisis.\n\nThe consultative process has its limitations. The representation claimed\nby  some  was  from  organizations  that  were  viewed  positively  by  the\nGovernment.  And  this  automatically  excluded  useful  but  controversial\nopinions. The representation of leaders who were able to state their opinions\nmarginalized groups that were less articulate. Also, members felt that there\nwas lack of monitoring to ensure that recommendations were implemented.\nGenerally,  the  Government  adopted  recommendations  made  by  members,\nbut members were not informed of the outcomes of the policy.\n\nThe closer relationship between the private and public sectors could also\nlead to corrupt practices, as some critics argue. The critics assert that a network\ncould develop and it could lead to cronyism. However, in the case of Malaysia,\nconsultation is institutionalized and transparent, and there is less tendency to\nfavor any one party.\n\nThe  institutionalization  of  consultation  in  Malaysia  well  beyond  a\nperiodic event is an innovation to ensure sustained political and social stability.\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n513\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\f514\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nReferences\n\nAhmad, Abdullah Sanusi, Norma Mansor, and Abdul Kuddus Ahmad. 2003.\nThe  Malaysian  Bureaucracy:  Four  Decades  of  Development.

Public  administration  in  these\ncountries was characterized by a formal hierarchical government structure.\nThe ruling party controlled policy formulation, assets, resource allocation,\nand  the  selection  and  distribution  of  personnel,  with  everything  directly\naccountable to the party auditing bodies. The collapse of the communist regime\nbrought the need to search for ways to change the public administration system.\nThe  options  were  to  exchange  the  communist  type  of  Weberian\nbureaucracy to the Western bureaucratic form, or to search for ways to become\nan entrepreneurial, less regulated, more flexible, and more participatory civil\nservice.  In  the  beginning  of  the  transition  there  were  no  indigenous  ideas\nabout democratic styles of administration, and officials were eager to adopt\nany  model  that  would  seem  acceptable  for  particular  social  and  political\nconditions. The objective of the post-communist countries, however, was not\nreform and improvement of the old system of public administration. With\nthe collapse of the communist regime the \u201cparty administration\u201d had lost all\ntrust and respect from society. Therefore, these countries needed to dismantle\nthe old system of party administration and develop a new system of public\nadministration (Verheijen 2003).\n\nIn Mongolia, the beginning of the transition, from 1990 to 1997, was\ndominated  by  a  developmental  approach  to  public  administration,  not  a\nreformist approach. The collapse of communism brought two contradicting\nideas about the theory and practice of the transition. The rush of ideas imposed\nfrom  abroad,  reflected  in  the  dominance  of  foreign  consultants,  brought\nnegative reactions to all foreign ideas and experiences as just another attempt\nto impose an unreliable model and system.

The attempt to find a balance between learning from international\npublic administration systems, the reform movement, and empirical assessment\nof the needs of the existing social reality created a developmental approach to\ntransition in Mongolia. Traditional Marxist methodology, which states that\nthe political and administrative structure of society has to be matched to the\neconomic and cultural basis of society, was deep-seated in the minds of scholars\nand experts at the beginning of the transition. This influenced the focus on\nthe  empirical  assessment  of  the  socioeconomic  condition  of  public  service\ntransition in defining ways of public sector transition. Mongolian scholars\nand experts were not only focusing on the new international reform movement\nbut also considering the transitional reality of society in order to reach a balance\nbetween  these  internal  and  external  factors.  Unfortunately,  learning  and\nevaluating the international public administration experience, studying and\nassessing the reality of the transitional society, and reflecting both of these in\npolicy development were not easy not only for scholars from the transitional\nregime, but also for specialists from developed countries. Therefore, not only\nwas balance between internal and external factors not always achieved but\nthese factors were not considered enough.\n\nAt the beginning of the transition, inspiration was drawn from countries\nwhere a traditional public administration was predominant, like Republic of\nKorea, Japan, and Germany. It is therefore not surprising that building the\ntraditional  career  system  was  given  a  high  priority  at  that  time.  However,\nfrom 1997, with problems emerging from the implementation of the newly\nestablished traditional system of public administration, on the one hand, and\nrising  influence  from  countries  (Australia,  New  Zealand,  Sweden,  United\nKingdom [UK], United States[US]) and international organizations (the World\nBank and the Asian Development Bank) advocating neoliberal views, on the\nother, reformist, New Public Management approaches became the dominant\nconsideration in Mongolia\u2019s public service transition.\n\nDevelopment of the Traditional Public Administration System\nin Mongolia\n\nThe traditional concepts of public administration, like hierarchy and\nrules,  permanence  and  stability,  and  equality  and  regulation,  appeared\nsomewhat similar to those that transitional regimes3 had used in the past and\n\n3\n\n In this paper \u201ctransitional regime\u201d refers only to post-communist transitional governments.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n516\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f Institutional Change in Mongolia:  Balancing Waves of Reform\n\n517\n\nmore acceptable to a society emerging from an authoritarian system. Some\nelements of the New Public Management (NPM) models seemed attractive,\nbut no one knew all the systems and models of public administration, including\nthe  traditional. Traditional  systems  of  public  administration  were  easy  to\nunderstand and accept, and seemed not too difficult to implement, given the\nsocial and cultural condition of the transitional regime. Also, it was only the\nfully developed and exercised public administration systems that were suitable\nfor the countries with no indigenous democratic style of administration. All\nother models of NPM consisted mostly of some new elements adapted to the\ntraditional  system  in  order  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  public  service.\nNaturally, from the beginning of its transition Mongolia opted to develop a\ntraditional style of public administration system.\n\nThe following policy documents contain the main principles of the new\npublic administration system developed in Mongolia at the initial stage of\ntransition:\n\n(cid:127) The new  Constitution (1992) and related key consequential laws.\nThis  defines  Mongolian  political  institutions  and  their  structure,\norganization, and functions.\n\n(cid:127) The  \u201cManagement  Development  Program\u201d  (1993),  which  was\nimplemented by the Government with assistance from the United\nNations  Development  Programme  and  other  donors.  The  roles,\nfunctions, and structures of the machinery of government with regard\nto the central and local governments and the private sector interface\nwere revised. The power of administrative institutions was clarified\nand significant improvements were made in improving the knowledge\nand skills of civil servants and private sector managers.\n\n(cid:127) The Law on Government Service (LGS) (1994), which provided the\nlegal environment of the new public service system. It defined public\npersonnel policy and the status of public employees, their duties and\nrights,  responsibilities,  incentives,  conditions  of  work,  and\nmanagement of the public service.\n\n(cid:127) Mongolian State Policy on Reforming Government Processes and the\nGeneral  System  of  Structure  (1996),  which  defined  a  new\norganizational structure for central government based on policy and\nplanning ministers with oversight of executive agencies. It identified\nthe policy of government cost reduction, including downsizing the\npublic service and strengthening accountability and control through\nministry and agency business plans and new financial management\nsystems.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n517\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f518\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nThe policy documents essentially established a traditional career-based\ncivil service within a Weberian type of bureaucracy, with central control over\nthe grading and classification of positions, remuneration and other personnel\ndecisions, and relatively permanent tenure positions. Decentralization was a\npart of the management development program, but it never received the same\npriority as public administration and civil service reform, and privatization\nand  private  sector  development.  As  a  consequence,  decentralization  lost\nmomentum and did not have the same impact as these other parts.\n\nBy comparing the main principles in these policy documents with the\n\u201cfive  old  chestnuts\u201d  of  the  traditional  model  (Peters  2001)  we  can  get  a\nsomewhat more complete idea about the traditional character of the public\nadministration system that was established at the beginning of the transition.\n\nAn Apolitical Civil Service\n\nIn order to establish and maintain a politically neutral civil service, the\nConstitution of Mongolia declared that \u201cParty membership of some categories\nof State employees may be suspended\u201d (article 16. section 10).\n\nThe Law on Government Service states that government core employees\nshall  have  the  duty  \u201cto  maintain  political  neutrality  while  exercising  the\nfunctions  of  the  post\u201d  (article  13,  section  8).  Later,  when  NPM  was\nimplemented,  this  article  was  amended  to  include  the  provision  that\ngovernment core employees should express only official positions in the media\nwhen discussing issues related to government policy. The Law on Government\nService (LGS) also restricts government core employees from \u201cparticipating\nin the activity of political parties in the capacity of a government officer\u201d and\n\u201cholding  concurrently  a  permanent  position  in  political  and  other\norganizations, unless otherwise provided by legislation.\u201d\n\nBecause there was no clear definition of what activities could be considered\n\u201cpolitical\u201d and what nonpolitical, these regulations provided only a general\ndeclaration of neutrality. Political allegiance and loyalty of civil servants to\npolitical parties were common and open.\n\nHierarchy and Rules\n\nThe public administration transition process in Mongolia from 1990 to\n1997 tried to create a Weberian and rule-directed bureaucracy. In the beginning,\nthe  first  priority  was  a  civil  service  independent  from  party  control,  and\ncompatible  with  the  emerging  market  society.  Issues  of  greater  economic\nefficiency and social effectiveness were not the highest priority.\n\nThe Government established a centrally managed career civil service,\nappointed on the principle of merit.

Further,  according  to  the  LGS,  public  service  \u201cis  the  activity  of\naccomplishing and implementing state goals and functions within the vested\npower,  as  set  out  in  the  Constitution  of  Mongolia  and  other  legislation\u201d\n(article 3.1)  These  statements  show  clearly  that  public  organizations  are\nestablished to act only in accordance with the law and public servants should\nimplement state goals and functions only within the vested power set out in\nthe law. The hierarchical structure and management of the newly established\npublic  service  was  reflected  in  its  overall  classification,  categorization,  and\nranking of all government posts by the LGS (Law on Government Service;\nResolution 73/1995 of the State Great Hural; Resolution 132/1995 of the\nGovernment).  The  first-ever  handbook  on  the  Mongolian  administrative\nstructure and personal management system stated that\n\nThe classification system enables the State to design the Government service\nand to allocate the resources to finance it. It also is used to estimate the\nremuneration  costs  and  other  running  costs  for  different  parts  of  the\ngovernment service. Decisions on salary and other forms of remuneration\nare also based on the classification system. (Samballhundev, Tsedev, and\nMujaan 1996, page 19).\n\nPermanence and Stability\n\nThe  newly  established  government  service  had  characteristics  of  the\ntraditional public administration, such as permanent and stable organization\nand staff. The Constitution requires that public offices \u201cshall be constituted\nin accordance with law\u201d and \u201cthe work conditions and social guarantees of\nState employees shall be determined by law\u201d (article 46), reflecting an overall\nphilosophy  of  permanence  of  government  organizations  and  stability  and\n\u201csocial guarantees for civil servants.\u201d According to the LGS, \u201ca real government\nemployee shall be a citizen of Mongolia, who holds a Government governing\nor executive post permanently on the basis of qualifications\u2026\u201d (article 11.2).\nIn  addition,  by  the  same  law  the  State  is  responsible  for  any  damage  that\noccurs as a result of a wrongful action by a government official in the course\nof exercising the powers provided by law (article 4.2.7). The LGS abolished\nthe patronage system and introduced recruitment and promotion on merit,\ncompetitive examinations, regular appraisal, common grading, and salary scales\nthroughout the civil service. It left recruitment open for all posts in the civil\nservice, the senior civil service included. Civil servants were to be recruited on\na permanent basis, with fixed-term contracts used for temporary staff only.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n519\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f520\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nHuman resources management in the civil service was to a large degree\ncentralized. This  system  included  entrance  examinations,  salary  schedules,\nincentive programs, training systems, and important procedures such as hiring\nand  firing.  The  Administrative  Service  Consul  organized  recruitment\nexaminations  centrally.  Every  ministry,  agency,  and  local  government  was\nresponsible  for  implementing  these  centrally  established  procedures  and\nregulations.  How  well  they  followed  the  procedures  and  regulations  was\nsupposed to be monitored by authorities within each hierarchy.\n\nHowever, senior civil servants continued to be appointed, evaluated, and\npromoted centrally. Vacancies for senior positions were not publicly announced\nand competitive examinations for senior positions were not organized until\n1 June 2003.\n\nInternal Regulation and Equality\n\nOne of the key principles of the LGS that guide government service is\n\u201cto administer and to be administered.\u201d This means that government core\nemployees  shall  implement  the  lawful  decisions  of  higher-ranking  officers\n(articles 4.2.1, 13.1.4). The result of this principle is management by hierarchy.\nEquality is another fundamental principle guiding the activities of the\nstate. It is found in the Constitution (article 1, paragraph. 2). The principle of\nequality in the administrative system means, for example, that the amount,\nscale,  and  rate  of  remuneration  for  a  particular  government  employee  is\ndetermined by a similar rate of remuneration for similar government positions\nthroughout the public service (LGS article 28.3.1). It also means that citizens\nshould expect to be treated the same without regard to their differences.\n\nProblems Emerging with the Traditional System\nof Public Administration\n\nThe  new  public  administration  system  met  the  social  needs  of  the\ntransition period with some promising outcomes. However, the structure did\nnot bear as much fruit as it did in developed countries (Tsedev 2002, page\n120). The reasons for this were as follows.\n\nProblems Associated with a Neutral Civil Service\n\nAn  apolitical  civil  service  did  not  work  well  at  the  beginning  of  the\ntransition,  when  a  traditional  public  administration  system  was  being\nestablished.\n\n(cid:127)\n\nIn socialist times everything was politicized. Citizens, especially civil\nservants, used to be \u201cpolitically\u201d very active, and usually saw most\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n520\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f Institutional Change in Mongolia:  Balancing Waves of Reform\n\n521\n\nthings through an ideological lens. Civil servants were selected and\nappointed using ideological criteria.\n\n(cid:127) The beginning of the transition was a time of \u201crevolutionary change,\u201d\nand everything became even more politicized. The nation was deeply\ndivided politically, from very conservative \u201ccommunist tip\u201d democrats\nto left-wing liberal democrats and \u201canarchist democrats.\u201d There were\nmore than 20 political parties for about only one million adults. Every\nissue was interpreted politically. Everyone, every time and everywhere,\ndiscussed every issue as a political issue.\nIn a small state it is very difficult to rely on the politics-administration\ndichotomy and establish a politically neutral civil service. Politicians\nand administrators at all levels have very close ties with each other.\nThere are very informal relations and networks between them and it\nis  difficult  to  differentiate  political  allegiance,  loyalty,  or  personal\nrelations.\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127) A small state does not have enough qualified specialists to organize\nthe civil service and the political sphere separately. A small number of\npeople have experience in both public administration and politics. It\nis almost impossible to find highly experienced and politically neutral\nspecialists to appoint to senior civil service positions. The recruitment\nof former high-ranking elected officials to senior civil service positions\nis common and necessary in small states. For this reason an amendment\nwas made to the LGS in 2002. According to this amendment, former\npoliticians who were holding high government posts can be included\non the civil servants resources list, without entrance examination and\non  the  basis  of  the  recommendation  of  the  Government  Service\nCouncil (article 17.11). Equally, most leading politicians and political\nconsultants come from the civil service. There are not many career\nsteps in a small civil service. A successful civil service career very quickly\nends up as a political position.\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127) When there is little respect for laws and regulations it is impossible to\nenforce a politics-administration dichotomy and the principles of an\napolitical, neutral civil service.\nFrom the beginning of the transition, long before the establishment of a\nnew civil service, competition among political parties for experienced\nand  skilled  specialists  deeply  politicized  and  divided  the  civil  service.\nCompeting  political  parties  began  using  political  loyalty  as  the  main\ncriterion of any career, including a civil service career. The situation could\nnot be changed simply by adapting new laws and regulations of the civil\nservice when law and rule meant very little to people.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n521\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f522\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nProblems Associated with Hierarchy and Rules\n\nAt first glance, a hierarchical and rule-bound system seemed to work in\nMongolia. The  law  established  public  organizations  and  regulations,  and\ngovernment  posts  were  organized  according  to  official  classification  and\nranking. Even the management of the public service was organized according\nto laws and regulations. But the quality of service of public organizations and\nthe work attitudes and habits of government employees had not changed much.\nThe organizational structure and management system still was not promising\neconomic efficiency or social effectiveness. Rule-directed organizations and\nmanagement in public service did not promise much because of the general\ndisrespect  for  law  and  regulations.  Obeying  rules  and  regulations  was  not\nalways the first priority of citizens, including civil servants. In a small state,\ninformal relationships and networks dominate all levels of the civil service,\nand  these  did  not  leave  much  space  for  the  effective  functioning  of  the\nhierarchical structure and management. Even though there are many steps in\nthe salary system, the differences in salary do not provide incentives that support\nthe role hierarchy. In addition, at the beginning of the transition, the views of\ncivil servants changed in ways that created a dilemma for them. Civil servants\nhad duties and responsibilities from the hierarchy in the new system. At the\nsame time, citizens had lost respect for civil servants, and civil servants had\nlost their authority and because of their loss of authority the hierarchy was\nnot functioning.\n\nProblems Associated with Permanence and Stability\n\nAlthough patronage has been banned and politics is officially separated\nfrom administration in laws and regulations, patronage is one of the main\nbreaches in the public service system. The rise of new political parties in the\ntransition reinforced this tendency, creating new incentives for patronage and\nfavoritism. In order to win elections and gain power, political parties began\nasking for the support and loyalty of key people in society in exchange for\npositions in the public service. In that way political parties became a host of\npotential seekers of administrative positions. Another factor that stimulated\npatronage was the small society and shared culture. Family and friends are\nfavored  over  official  norms  and  regulations.  Even  though  a  merit-based,\nprofessional civil service is espoused in current laws or decrees, it is clear that\nmany civil servants anticipated that after the new elections there would be\nsubstantial changes throughout the civil service. They expected that many of\nthe  current  civil  servants  would  be  replaced  by  people  chosen  by  the  new\ngovernment. On the other hand, many supporters and relatives of the party\nleaders  expected  that  if  their  party  won  they  would  be  rewarded  with\nadministrative positions.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n522\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f Institutional Change in Mongolia:  Balancing Waves of Reform\n\n523\n\nFor a year and a half after the LGS passed in 1994 until the next elections,\nvarious laws and acts were passed and went into force, and the new public\nservice  structure  appeared  promising.  Right  after  the  elections,  however,\nsuspicions arose and the process deteriorated. Political parties and the new\nelectoral process politicized the new public service structure and used it for\ntheir own interests, negatively affecting the confidence of the people in the\nstructure. On 1 June 1995, the LGS was enacted, allowing a large number of\nmembers of the then ruling power, the Mongolian Revolutionary Party, to\ntake an oath and become civil servants, without passing any examinations or\nassessments. This had a negative impact on the implementation of a merit-\nbased system for the new public service. The winner of the 1996 elections, the\nDemocratic Union and Coalition, further worsened the situation and weakened\nthe implementation of the new structure. Instead of correcting the previous\nmistakes, they simply carried out a deconstruction mechanism by replacing\nthe former officials en masse with their own. Public servants were laid off or\nsent  to  different  positions  in  spite  of  the  principles  and  spirit  of  the  new\nstructure.  At  the  same  time,  for  senior  positions,  civil  service  entrance\nprocedures (selection examinations, a waiting list, appointment, probationary\nperiod, and performance evaluation) were skipped and the oath ceremony\nwas used to give politically appointed employees core civil service status. For\nlower positions there was an appearance of using the procedures, but there\nwas much manipulation around the procedures. As an example, temporary\nappointments were used to avoid competition for a position.\n\nThe newly adopted traditional administration emphasized stability by\nhaving most positions in the civil service. For example, in the ministries only\nthe  minister  and  at  the  provincial  level  only  the  governor  were  political\nappointments. All the rest were administrative. This regulation contradicted\nthe interests of political parties to place more of their supporters in political\npositions  and  became  difficult  to  implement.  The  new  constitution,  in\naddressing local governments, emphasized more democratic practices by having\nthe lowest officials\u2014bag governor\u2014elected. It was very inefficient to have the\nlowest administrative officials in political positions, changing them every 4\nyears. This regulation facilitated the politicization of civil servants at the local\nlevel. Under the new system, high-ranking political officials were employed\nby the Government Administrative Service Consul, which started politicizing\nthe management of the civil service. In this way, in the new administrative\nsystem  political  positions  were  made  administrative  and  administrative\npositions were made political.\n\nThus, as in many other post-communist states (see Verheijen 2003), the\nadoption  of  civil  service  laws  and  related  regulations  did  not  resolve  the\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n523\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f524\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nproblems of instability, predictability, and politicization and did not lead to\nthe development of a well-working system of long-term career development.\n\nPublic Administration Reform in Mongolia\n\nMongolia adopted a traditional system of public administration until\n1997. As we see from above, the newly created system was not functioning\nwell  and  needed  either  further  development  or  reform. The  dominant\nassumption was that government could not do anything well, so it was a good\nidea to introduce change that was as radical as possible to make government\nas modern as possible.\n\nInitial  advocates  of  the  NPM  reform  were  leaders  of  the  democratic\ncoalition  government  and  international  consultants  from  the  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).  Although  NPM  advocates  promised  more\nindependence for government organizations and their managers, government\nwas not attracting civil servants at all levels. Their main concern was instability,\npoliticization, and corruption in the public service.\n\nLeaders of the democratic coalition government had several reasons to\nsupport the reforms. First, they were not satisfied with the responsibility and\naccountability of government organizations and their public employees and\nwanted to improve these by reforming the system. Second, the finance and\nbudgeting mechanism of the public service was not transformed from the old\nmodel  and  needed  to  be  fixed.  Political  leaders  hoped  that  NPM  reforms\nwould not only establish new finance and budgeting mechanisms, but also\nsolve many other problems now emerging from the traditional model. Third,\nleaders of the coalition government were not happy with public employees\nwho were collectively transferred from the old regime into a stable career system.\nThey  saw  NPM  reform  as  one  way  to  deal  with  their  problem  of  the\npermanence of ineffective bureaucrats. Fourth, they wanted to reduce the size\nof the government and redirect resources to higher-priority social needs like\npoverty reduction and economic development. Finally, adopting these reforms\nin  the  public  service  was  in  compliance  with  requirements  of  the  major\ninternational  donor  organizations\u2014what  has  come  to  be  known  as  \u201cgood\ngovernance\u201d\u2014for loans and grants\u201d (Peters 2001, page 163).\n\nIn  addition  to  this,  there  were  external  pressures  to  impose  the  New\nZealand model of NPM. The major international advocate of the New Zealand\ntype  of  reform  was  the  ADB.  In  March  1997,  the  coalition  government\nscrapped  the  Management  Development  Program,  the  program  that  had\nassisted  Mongolian  public  administration  development,  and  initiated  a\ntechnical aid project supported by ADB. It was called the Public Administration\nReform  Project.  The  purpose  of  the  new  project  was  to  reform  the\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n524\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f Institutional Change in Mongolia:  Balancing Waves of Reform\n\n525\n\nadministrative  and  financial  structure  of  the  state  budget  organization;  to\npromote outcome-based budgetary planning, spending, and report structures;\nand to reduce government expenditures. Since then, ADB has supported and\nparticipated in every step of the reform through this project.\n\nNot every international donor organization supported reform initiatives\nin the beginning. Many donor organizations and international consultants\nfrom  the  European  Union,  Japan,  and  Republic  of  Korea  were  suspicious\nabout the predicted successes of the reform. Most of these donor organizations\nwere assisting the public service transition in Mongolia and some of them\ncontinued their assistance within the traditional reform, some taking more\nneutral positions and reducing their involvement in the process.\n\nThis new public service reform initiative was strongly opposed at the\noutset by elected and appointed officials, and by public servants. Public servants\ndid not welcome the initiative, as they believed the new structure would bring\ntoo much uncertainty. The classic form of bureaucracy used in the first phases\nof  transition  was  close  to  Mongolia\u2019s  understanding,  knowledge,  skills,\nexperience, and culture. NPM, on the other hand, was difficult to receive in a\nshort time and most people were still unfamiliar with it. Public servants and\nnational professionals were not ready to embrace the ideology of NPM. The\nattempt to impose it from the top, changing the direction of public service\nand administration, undermined confidence in implementing and developing\nnew structures for public service and administration and left a lingering disbelief\nin the past and suspicion about the future (Tsedev 2002, page 120).\n\nIn November 1999 the Government introduced a draft of the Public\nSector Management and Finance Law (PSMFL) into Parliament. It was not\npassed, but was the subject of considerable debate. Public servants worked for\n5 years to implement a new structure of public service and administration,\ngreeting every new session of the Parliament with the expectation that things\nwould change with the passage of PSMFL (Tsedev 2002, page 120). After\nmany debates and amendments to the draft PSMFL, the law passed in June 2002\nand began gradual implementation from January 2003. The law is based on\nprinciples that are very different from traditional public administration, with\nmost control over inputs, including personnel decision making, devolved to\nmanagers  in  line  agencies,  and  comprehensive  strategic  planning  processes\nand accountability for performance being \u201cpurchased\u201d by the Government.\nAt the same time, the LGS and other laws and regulations of the public\nservice were reviewed and substantially amended in order to take the PSMFL\ninto account. However, although reviewed and amended, the LGS retained and\nstrengthened  the  traditional  central  controls  on  civil  service  staffing  inputs,\nincluding  central  control  over  the  grading  and  classification  of  positions,\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n525\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f526\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nremuneration and other personnel decisions, and relatively permanent positions.\nAccording to the PSMFL, the main concepts of public service reform\nconsist of the following tools and principles (Government of Mongolia 2002a):\n\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n\nLegislated medium-term strategic business plans and fiscal objectives.\nPerformance agreements negotiated between ministers and general\nmanagers, and between general managers and public employees.\n(cid:127) Output-based  budgeting  (receiving  funding  on  the  basis  of  the\n\ngovernment purchasing contract).\n(cid:127)\nPerformance reporting on the basis of performance indicators.\n(cid:127) Accounting standards in accordance with international accounting\n\nstandards (full accrual accounting).\n\n(cid:127) Capital charges on net assets employed by government organizations.\n(cid:127) Managerial authority over inputs, including employment of staff and\n\n(cid:127)\n\noperating expenses.\nFor vacant chief executive positions, selection by the State Service\nCouncil of a short list of candidates for appropriate authorities to\ndecide. The  council  holds  the  employment  contracts  of  the  chief\nexecutives and assesses their performance.\n\n(cid:127) Annual  audits  of  all  government  organizations  by  the  State  Audit\n\nAuthority.\n\nSince several former officials of the New Zealand Treasury (Dr. Graham\nScott, Prof. Ian Ball) had been involved as advisers in the initial drafting of\nthe PSMFL and much has been learned from the New Zealand experience,\nthe Law closely tracks the relevant New Zealand legislation, and the reform\nconcepts  and  principles  reflect  many  of  the  characteristic  features  of  New\nZealand\u2019s financial management reform (Laking 2000).\n\nPublic Administration Reform in Mongolia and Basic Models\nof Governance Reform\n\nTo present a more complete idea of Mongolia\u2019s public administration\ntransition we now examine its development and reform efforts by comparing\nthem with concepts and principles of four basic models of reform of governance\ncreated by Peters (2001).\n\nMongolian Reform Effort and Market Models\n\nThe basic assumption of the market model is that the best way to obtain\nbetter results from public sector organizations is to adopt some sort of a market-\nbased mechanism to replace the traditional bureaucracy (Peters 2001, page 23).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n526\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f Institutional Change in Mongolia:  Balancing Waves of Reform\n\n527\n\nAccording to the market model, competitive mechanisms would allocate\npublic resources efficiently and minimize the cost of delivering services (Peters\n2001, pages 25\u201330). In the case of a small society, such as Mongolia, it is\ndifficult to use competitive mechanisms in the public sector, especially in the\ncivil service. Not only can small societies not organize competing institutions\nand positions in one area of service, but public institutions and civil service\npositions  usually  have  multiple  functions.  In  small  countries  one  public\norganization usually deals with several different tasks and has only one specialist\nfor  every  specific  area  of  service  (Randma  2001).  On  the  other  hand,  the\nprivate sector is underdeveloped in transitional regimes and competition with\na public sector monopoly is quite limited. Introducing the market model to\npublic service in a small society in a period of transition cannot guarantee the\ncompetitiveness  of  service  and  greater  efficiency.  In  the  case  of  Mongolia,\nreform  was  introduced  to  improve  the  efficiency,  accountability,  and\nresponsibility of public servants by pricing the services delivered by public\ninstitutions and financing, evaluating, and accounting for this price. Yet it is\ndifficult to find the true price and drive the costs of the service in the absence\nof competition. In addition, without competition public bureaucrats have a\nchance to use their monopoly on information and their informal relations\nwith  officials  in  the  budgeting  process  to  supply  what  they  are  able  to  do\nwhile asking more than it costs.\n\nAnother fundamental idea of the market model is generic management\n(Peters  200,  page  31).  This  is  based  on  the  idea  that  \u201cmanagement  is\nmanagement, no matter where it takes place\u201d and introduces the principal-\nagent relationship in public service. In the early stages of the transition, elements\nof  strategic  planning  and  management  by  objectives  were  introduced.\nSpecifically, the Mongolian State Policy on Reforming Government Processes\nand  the  General  System  of  Structure  (1996)  included  many  managerialist\nideas,  such  as  entrepreneurial,  innovative,  and  creative  management;\ncontinuous improvement and experimentation; customer-oriented services;\nand  managers  managing  within  an  appropriate  accountability  framework.\nContracting and service output price\u2013based budgeting were introduced with\nthe NPM reforms. Government, through its ministers and local governors,\nbecame the purchaser of the outputs of the public organizations that produced\nthe service. One of the difficulties facing the Government now is defining the\noutputs  or  products  that  it  can  order  from  public  organizations  and\ndetermining the true cost of the products.\n\nPerformance  management  is  one  of  the  central  points  of  the  NPM\nreform. With the introduction of NPM, government has created general\nguidelines  for  performance  measurement,  including  qualitative  and\nquantitative criteria. According to this guide, every single organization and\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n527\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f528\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nemployee each year has to set specific measures for every task they have to\nperform. Because of the lack of knowledge and skills of managers and public\nemployees, this task is not going well. Public employees do not know what\ncriteria to use and how to measure the quality of what they produce. There\nis a great need for training and practice for performance management in the\npublic  sector.  Different  criteria  of  measurement  are  needed  for  different\ntimes and conditions. It is unusual to be able to use the same criteria of\nmeasurement across all situations.\n\nThe market model tends to see public and private management as the\nsame thing, and citizens as consumers or customers who should expect the\nsame quality of services that they receive from a private sector firm (Peters\n2001, page 45). However, citizens in transitional countries do not have enough\nexperience as costumers of the private sector. Newly emerging private sectors\nin these countries do not have a great deal of experience not only to share with\nthe  public  service,  but  even  to  provide  high-quality  service  for  their  own\nconsumers. So, all private sector experiences that would be introduced to the\npublic service of the transition countries within the market model can only be\nimposed from the business experience of other countries.\n\nOne central element of the market reforms is decentralization of policy\nmaking and implementation (Peters 2001, page 34). The most common way\nof doing this is \u201cto use private or quasi-government organizations to deliver\npublic service,\u201d  to \u201c[split] up large departments into smaller \u2018agencies,\u2019 or [to\nassign]  functions  to  lower  levels  of  government,\u201d  and  to  \u201ccreate  multiple\ncompetitive organizations to supply goods and services\u201d (Peters 2001, pages\n33\u201334). Privatization, the use of private and nongovernment organizations to\ndeliver  public  services,  has  been  used  by  the  Mongolian  Government  as  a\nreform tool to create some competition in public services, such as schooling,\nhealth, and transport, but not much in the civil service. Because of the small-\nsociety  factor,  all  public  organizations  need  to  be  multiservice  and\nmultifunction  bureaus.  Splitting  public  organizations  into  \u201cproduct  line,\u201d\nsingle-purpose organizations is not applicable to the Mongolian public service.\nTherefore,  from  the  beginning,  public  administration  development  was\noriented  to  reorganizing  several  small  organizations  into  one  larger,  more\nmultiservice organization, or transferring their functions to nongovernment\nand private organizations. For example, the number of government ministers\nwas reduced from 16 to 9 and government agencies from 57 to 48. However,\nafter  the  elections,  the  number  of  government  ministers  grew  again.  For\ninstance, while the Government in 2000 had organized 12 ministers instead\nof the previous 9, the coalition government 2004 established 18 ministers.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n528\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f Institutional Change in Mongolia:  Balancing Waves of Reform\n\n529\n\nThe orientation to personnel management in the market model includes\npay for performance so that better performance can be rewarded with better\npay.\n\nGovernments should provide sufficient incentives for individuals working\nwithin them to perform their jobs as efficiently as they might (Peters 2001,\npages 23, 37). In communist countries, most public servants believed that\nthey had to work not for personal rewards but to exercise communist ideology,\nto serve society as a whole, and to implement public policy for the country\nand the communist system. With the collapse of communism, this kind of\naltruism and any concern for public interests was disregarded as old-fashioned\ncommunist ideology. Therefore, for public employees in transitional regimes,\nthe idea of working not for personal rewards but in behalf of a public policy is\nnot very applicable. Furthermore, civil servants\u2019 self-determination on their\njobs is limited by the self-interests of their managers and politicians. If the\nself-interests of these bosses were to interrupt any area of their job, civil servants\nwould most likely lose their \u201cempowerment.\u201d\n\nAccording  to  the  LGS,  the  scale,  rate,  procedure,  and  amount  of\nremuneration and supplementary payment due to government employees shall\nbe defined by the Parliament or by the Government in accordance with the\npost classification, rank, and length of government service (article 28, sections\n3\u20138).  Thus,  by  reregulation  of  the  LGS,  there  is  not  much  room  for\nperformance-based pay in public service. NPM introduced the reform elements\nof bonus pay to the government employees\u2019 remuneration system to achieve\nsome coordination between pay and performance. For many reasons this bonus\npay is not making much difference. Poor salary and poor bonus do not motivate\ncivil servants. Poor performance evaluation practices also are not promising\nmuch  from  the  bonus  system.  Funding  these  bonuses  adequately  and\ndeveloping workable measures for performance is not only a difficult problem\nfor  transitional  countries,  it  is  an  issue  for  developed  countries,  too.  As\nmentioned  in  Peters  (2001,  p.  38),  \u201cthe  failure  of  Congress  to  fund  these\nbonuses  adequately  and  difficulties  in  developing  the  measures  to  judge\nmeritorious performance have rendered the merit pay system only a hollow\necho  of  its  original  intent.\u201d  As  with  other  countries,  marketability  and\nmeasurability of many government services is limited. The capacity of the\ngovernment to measure performance in relation to impact is limited. Mostly\nit can be done on the activity level, or on the quantity of outputs. On the\nother hand, for Mongolia and some other transitional countries to provide\nsufficient incentives for individuals working in public service is very difficult.\nThey do not have sufficient financial resources to motivate people materially.\nImproving the performance of civil servants would not save enough resources\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n529\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f530\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nto motivate individuals. Even if government could save sufficient resources,\nthese  would  go  to  high-priority  social  and  economic  needs  instead  of  to\nmotivate civil servants. It is therefore hard to say that adopting some sort of a\nmarket-based  mechanism  in  a  traditional  public  administration  system  of\ntransitional countries can motivate civil servants. Civil servants in transitional\ncountries do not expect material motivation but have other motivations such\nas job security, the possibilities of self-development, and social status.\n\nThe public interest in the market model requires that government deliver\npublic services cheaply and allow citizens to exercise free choice (Peters 2001,\npages 46\u201347). In the case of Mongolia, it is too early to judge cost savings\nresulting from NPM reforms. Public institutions are learning to calculate the\ncost  of  goods  and  services  that  they  deliver  to  citizens. Time  is  needed  to\ncompare and find out whether public goods and services have become cheaper\nfor citizens. The fact that government organizations are now calculating their\ncost is progress compared with input-oriented, line-item budgeting. With its\npoor budget the Government is not capable of creating many public service\noptions  in  order  to  provide  freer  choice  to  citizens.  Without  a  strong,\ncompetitive private sector it is impossible to break up the traditional public\nservice  monopolies.  Even  after  the  introduction  of  output  budgeting  and\ncompetitive mechanisms in public service, we cannot expect free choices of\nservices  by  citizens.  A  small  society  and  extremely  limited  market  are  not\ngoing to change quickly to develop real competitive markets with many choice\noptions.\n\nIn the end, some ideas from the market model have been introduced\nand gradually implemented, while many other elements of the model do not\nwork well. Many generic management ideas, like legislated strategic planning,\nperformance  agreement,  output-oriented  budgeting,  and  performance\nreporting, have been. However, other fundamental pieces of market model,\nlike competitive mechanism, performance pay, free choice, and cheap service\nare not promising much in the current stage of social transition.\n\nThe Participatory State and Reform Effort of Mongolia\n\nThe empowerment of citizens and lower-echelon employees and their\nactive involvement in policy making and the delivery of public services is the\nmain assumption of the participatory model of public administration (Peters\n2001, pages 50\u201376).\n\nOn  the  one  hand,  in  transitional  regimes  the  bureaucracy  had  been\nauthoritarian and permitted little if any options for the clients of the programs\nto express individual demands or complain about the services being rendered\n(Peters 2001, page 171). On the other hand, citizens of the communist legacy\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n530\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f Institutional Change in Mongolia:  Balancing Waves of Reform\n\n531\n\nonce received every possible service without a great deal of participation in\nthe decision-making and service delivery process. They had little intention of\nand enthusiasm for productive participation. Citizens in transitional countries\ntend to criticize the public service and wait for good service from bureaucrats,\ninstead of participating in the process. If the authoritarian and hierarchical\ncharacter of the traditional regime resisted more participation and democracy,\nthe  lower-echelon  servants  and  citizens\u2019  inability  to  become  involved\nproductively in policy making and service creation created a more hierarchical\napproach.\n\nIn order to involve central and local public administrative bodies at all\nlevels, NGOs, the private sector, mass media, academic institutions, and citizens\nin  policy  formulation  and  implementation,  the  Government  of  Mongolia\ninitiated  and  implemented  the  Good  Government  for  Human  Security\nProgram  starting  in  2000. The  project  was  intended  to  establish  a  policy\nformulation and implementation partnership through the participation of all\nrelevant actors and stakeholders in the process. Special consideration was given\nto community participation and citizens\u2019 voice in the policy process and their\nsatisfaction  and  feedback  with  regard  to  services,  rights,  and  government\nresponsiveness to citizens\u2019 demands. This broad participation was supposed\nto create consensus among all major actors, stakeholders, and opinion formers.\nThis  would  establish  societal  ownership  of  policies,  which  could  lead  to\nextensive collaboration between the sectors in implementation and greater\npolicy effectiveness, in addition to greater policy continuity and sustainability.\nThere has been much talk about the participation of citizens and lower-\nechelon  civil  servants  in  decision-making  processes,  but  this  right  of\nparticipation is not well regulated legally. In practice there is not much informal\nparticipation in decision making. In order to facilitate greater participation\nwe need to find more organized and slightly controlled ways to practice it.\nThere is still not much room for participation in the public service system\neven after the introduction of the NPM reforms. Studies show that there has\nbeen  no  participation  by  citizens  at  any  level  of  budget  making  in  local\ngovernments.  Equally,  there  appears  to  be  no  participation  in  the  budget\nprocesses  of  any  other  government  organizations  (Household  Livelihoods\nSupport Program Office of Mongolia 2004). Civil servants and senior managers\nare setting the goals, objectives, and performance criteria in noncompetitive\nand nonparticipatory conditions. Without market competition and citizens\u2019\nparticipation, public employees tend to set lower goals and general, acceptable\ncriteria of performance.\n\nParticipation  and  democracy  in  Mongolia  is  generally  based  on\nparticipation  through  political  parties  and  interest  groups.  Citizens\u2019  direct\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n531\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f532\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nparticipation in administrative decision making and control over public service\nis not common. Citizens do not have any direct control over public services,\nsuch  as  education  or  health.  First,  public  service  is  highly  centralized  and\nbureaucratic and there is not much room for direct participation. Second,\nextreme individualism has become a dominant public characteristic in the\ntransition to a market society. This is in contrast to the common public interest\napproach  of  the  communist  legacy.  Now  most  citizens  tend  to  use  their\nparticipation in administrative decision making not for the public interest\nbut for their private self-interests. In small societies with complex relationships,\ncitizens\u2019 participation many times turns into meaningless fights between local\nsubgroups. Third, not every citizen has the ability and capacity to participate\nin administrative processes. Nomads, for example, living far from each other\nand  the  administrative  centers  and  traveling  across  the  seasons,  cannot\nparticipate in governance directly and constantly. Fourth, citizens have little\nexperience,  culture,  expectation,  and  enthusiasm  for  participating  in\nadministrative process. They do not have any experience of public service in a\nmarket  regime,  and  most  expectations  of  public  service  are  based  on  the\nsocialist. Citizens, especially local citizens, are not used to taking responsibility\nfor their lives. This attitude is part of the inherited culture, which emasculated\ncitizens and made them look above for decisions about their own lives. Finally,\ngovernment employees have little knowledge and skills to handle broad citizens\u2019\nparticipation in any area of public service.\n\nIn Mongolia, administrative development and reform processes hierarchy\nwas more dominant than participation. One of the problems was that reforms\nwere imposed by a \u201ctop-down process\u201d through legislation. This started with\nthe  formulation  of  new  laws  and  was  followed  by  implementation  down\nthrough the government hierarchy. As a result of management by hierarchy\nand regulation, the implementation of the public service reforms became more\na matter of compliance with new rules and regulations than a mechanism of\nchange. At the beginning of the reform, adjustment and adaptation to the\nnew requirements became the goals and objectives of public servants rather\nthan the stated reform goals. Because of this, there are big gaps between the\nexpected output of the reforms and the reality of their implementation. In\nthis regard, there are not many differences between the implementation of the\ntraditional system of public administration and the NPM model. Filling the\ncontents of NPM reform model would require more time, effort, energy, and\nskills than implementing the traditional model.\n\nIn Mongolia, a very common negative impression of government is the\nimproper work of the lower- and middle-level public employees. The argument\nis usually that government works well on the policy design\u2013making level, but\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n532\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f Institutional Change in Mongolia:  Balancing Waves of Reform\n\n533\n\nbecause of the poor performance of the low- and middle-level bureaucrats in\nimplementing decisions, overall government performance is poor and leaves a\nnegative impression. There is no doubt that citizens are dissatisfied by the\nservice provided by the low- and middle-level bureaucrats. But citizens are\nalso not happy with the performance of politicians. It seems the top-down\napproach to development and reform in public administration works the same\nway in the policy formulation and strategic planning stages. Yet when the\ntime comes for implementation and further development the approach reaches\nits limits. Pressures are coming from the bottom to establish more room for\ninitiatives and creativity in order to further develop reforms.\n\nFrom the beginning of the transition, the Government took the lead in\nfinding a balance between the central Government and local self-government.\nIn the Constitution, local governance is defined as a combination of the state\nand local self-governance (article 59, para. 1). In the same Constitution, all\nlevels of local officials are considered state representatives (article 60, para. 1)\nand  their  offices  are  part  of  state  administration.  As  a  result,  public\nadministration is still fundamentally state administration. Decentralization\nhas been implemented by transferring power from the central administrative\nbodies  to  local  administrative  institutions  and  by  privatizing  state-owned\nenterprises.  Since  the  end  of  the  implementation  of  the  Management\nDevelopment Program in 1996, the laws and policies of decentralization have\nnot  been  sufficiently  consolidated.  Currently  there  are  no  particular  policy\ndocuments  focusing  specifically  on  decentralization,  and  the  issue  of\ndecentralization  itself  has  not  been  addressed  as  a  policy  priority. There  are\ndifferent understandings of decentralization at both social and administrative\nlevels. Even some administrative decisions are creating a negative environment\nfor  decentralization  (Household  Livelihoods  Support  Program  Office  of\nMongolia 2004).\n\nNPM reform without strong competition and active citizens\u2019 participation\ncreates opportunities for civil servants to determine their goals, objectives,\nand performance criteria on the basis of their own interests. These interests do\nnot set high goals or hard criteria for performance, and serve the interests of\ntheir  own  organization,  along  with  limited  special  private  interests.  Civil\nservants also price their services higher than their true cost. One way to enforce\norder and the public interest would be through citizens\u2019 participation at all\nlevels of government decision making and implementation. Within the NPM\nreform,  citizens\u2019  participation  is  one  of  the  main  components  of  quality,\nequality,  and  honesty  of  service,  and  of  control  over  corruption  and\nmismanagement in transitional regimes. Thus, in transitional regimes, citizens\u2019\nparticipation is as important as stability and predictability of administration,\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n533\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f534\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nor the entrepreneurialism of managers and the hierarchy and regulation of the\nbureaucracy.\n\nPublic Administration Reform in Mongolia and Flexible Government\nAccording  to  advocates  of  flexible  government,  permanent  structures\npresent significant problems for effective and efficient governance, and the\norganizational universe needs to be shaken up to make it capable of responding\neffectively to new challenges (Peters 2001, pages 77\u201396).\n\nAt first glance, the transitional administration in Mongolia had to be\nflexible. Public organizations in these regimes attempt to adapt to frequently\nchanging  socioeconomic  and  political  environments  and  to  global\ndevelopments, and are forced to reorganize and restructure themselves more\nfrequently  than  government  organizations  in  the  developed  world.  In  this\nsense,  permanence  is  not  a  characteristic  of  government  organizations  in\ntransitional societies.\n\nThese constant changes in most cases produce problems in predictability\nand coordination. In addition, the bureaucrats of transitional regimes are too\nflexible in their responses to society when it comes to their preferential treatment\nof citizens (Peters 2001, page 173). It is common for government bureaucrats\nto treat citizens differently, using criteria such as politics, family, friends, and\nbusiness  relations.  Accordingly,  in  Mongolian  public  administration,\ndevelopment stability and predictability, rather than flexibility, were given the\nfirst priority. The state introduced a career-based, permanent employment\nsystem in its civil service. Moreover, within the NPM reforms the Government\ndecided to strengthen the stable, career-based character of the civil service\npersonnel management by amending the LGS.\n\nOn the other hand, the administrative culture, bureaucratic behavior,\nand the working habits of public employees are not much changed. In contrast\nwith the new developments, civil servants have been locked into certain ways\nof running public business (Peters 2001, page 173). The problems are in the\ncommon practices of exercising public power. Little if anything has been done\nto  replace  the  culture  and  working  attitude  of  bureaucrats.  So  within  the\nchanges  in  policy  and  regulations,  bureaucrats  tend  to  adapt  to  the  new\nsituation rather than changing themselves. They keep doing what they have\nbeen doing for years, in the same traditional way, but within the new. Flexible\nadaptation  to  change  occurs  mostly  for  the  self-interest  of  government\norganizations or the bureaucrats, not for the needs and interests of the public.\nMost  government  organizations,  especially  local  governments,  continue  to\noperate as if the phenomenon of public service reform had never occurred.\nThese organizations use NPM tools only for formal report purposes. They\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n534\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f Institutional Change in Mongolia:  Balancing Waves of Reform\n\n535\n\nremember  NPM  only  at  the  times  each  year  when  they  set  the  goals  and\nperformance measurements, sign performance contracts, evaluate contracts,\nand issue reports. Many government organizations want change without any\ninvestment. They  want  to  implement  public  administration  reform  not  by\nchanging their working habits and cultures but by setting goals and performance\nstandards and making formal contracts and reports. In addition, as noted earlier,\nfrom communist times many civil servants worked for ideas and principles rather\nthan for clients or customers. For many government employees, these ideas and\nprinciples now are directly connected to the concepts and principles of public\nadministration reform, to status, and to the future existence of their organization.\nFor these bureaucrats, formal compliance with new concepts and principles is\nmore important than real change in service to citizens.\n\nAnother factor that makes Mongolian civil service stable is the small\npool of experts and the prominence of family and friends in a small society. It\nis common that when someone is fired from a government organization for\nany reason, he or she ends up with an offer of a similar or higher position\nfrom another government organization. On the other hand, experts attracted\nfrom business to government organizations in most cases happen to be former\ncivil servants who transferred to business not long ago. The main reason for\nthis is the small number of experts and their traditional relations with each\nother. As a consequence, from the personnel point of view civil servants mostly\nremain permanent in a small society.\n\nThus, if \u201cshaking up the organizational universe\u201d is not the first priority\nof  public  administration  reform,  shaking  up  the  cultural  and  behavioral\nuniverse  of  public  bureaucrats  becomes  a  critical  issue  for  these  regimes.\nWithout changing the social attitudes of citizens, administrative culture, and\nthe bureaucratic behavior of civil servants, no permanent and stable traditional\nsystem, no flexible system, and no other model could provide the predictable\nand  fair  treatment  of  citizens  that  is  so  much  needed  in  transitional\nadministration. Thus, changing the attitudes of administrative culture and\nmaking it responsive to the changing demands of citizens is one important\ntask of transitional regimes. In the end, the continuously changing environment\nof transitional societies demands a degree of permanence and stability within\na flexible service that is capable of coping with rapid changes.\n\nDeregulated Government and Public Administration Reform\nin Mongolia\n\nThe main assumption of deregulated government is that the rule-bound\nnature of public administration slows action and reduces creativity. With the\nremoval of the constraints of internal red tape, activities can become more\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n535\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f536\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\ncreative,  more  effective,  and  more  efficient  and  liberate  workers  as\nentrepreneurial engineers (Peters 2001, pages 97\u201398).\n\nWith the collapse of the ruling communist party, large numbers of rigid\nex ante and ex post controls over bureaucrats were disregarded automatically,\nwithout being replaced by new, more flexible, democratic, and legal regulations.\nMost  of  these  rigid  and  arbitrary  regulations  were  ideological,  and  their\ndismissal  at  the  beginning  of  transition  produced  a  form  of  \u201cderegulated\ngovernment.\u201d\n\nTransitional governments do not have many rules and regulations that\nslow action and reduce the creativity of civil servants. Therefore, deregulation\nof the public service and liberation of public employees is not much of an\nissue. In reality, in the transition period there is always a lack of regulation in\nall sectors of society. Civil servants have much room to exercise discretion.\nPeople in government are free to act creatively, but one does not see much\npositive action or creative initiatives from public employees. There are several\nreasons for this. First, there are still some regulations from the communist\nperiod that, even if not respected or obeyed by many people, are still enforced\nand slow creative action. Second, people in general, and public employees in\nparticular, are accustomed to acting on directions from above and on the basis\nof clear rules and regulations. They are not to ready take a chance and set their\nown directions. They wait instead for new regulations that will authorize their\naction. These people need to be free from the past and encouraged to act\ncreatively. Third, those who were taking chances and being creative mostly\ndid not work for the public interest. Unfortunately, many of them saw the\nuncertainty of the transition as a chance to use public power for own private\npurposes. For these employees, transitional government needed more rules\nand regulations.\n\nWithin its transition, Mongolia started adopting and enforcing laws and\nregulations  designed  to  protect  public  servants  from  abuse,  to  ensure  more\nequitable  hiring,  and  to  prevent  patronage  and  political  exploitation  of\ngovernment positions. Legal reforms have been implemented according to the\nConstitution (1992), the attachment law to the Constitution (\u201cOn Transference\nfrom  Implementation  of  the  Constitution  of  PRM  to  the  Constitution  of\nMongolia\u201d) (1992), the Legal Reform Program (1998), and the Main Directory\nof Improving the Laws and Regulations until the Year 2004 (2001). In complying\nwith this legal reform policy, between 1992 and 2000 the Parliament adopted\naround 370 new laws and made changes and amendments to more than 340\nlaws (Amarsanaa 2002, page 81). In just the 4 years between 1992 and 1996,\nabout 70 laws associated with government service were adopted. Furthermore,\nin only about a half-year\u2019s time, more than 60 new procedures and regulations\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n536\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f Institutional Change in Mongolia:  Balancing Waves of Reform\n\n537\n\nof public service were adopted and gradually implemented (Samballhundev,\nTsedev, and Mujaan 1996). These rules and regulations helped managers to\nhire, pay, promote, and terminate employees. Yet, not all government agencies\naccepted them, and breaking them for self-interest was very common. In addition,\nall these regulations were derived from the traditional model of public service\nwith few elements from new models.\n\nEven  in  these  early  stages  of  the  process  of  legal  reform,  signs  of\noverregulation become apparent. There was a \u201cmechanical\u201d increase in the\nnumber of laws because every ministry and agency wanted to have its \u201cown\nlaw\u201d  or  raise  up  to  the  level  of  the  laws  their  own  \u201ctiny\u201d  instructions  and\norders  (Amarsanaa  2002,  page  81;  Chimid  2002,  page  71).  Furthermore,\nbesides  the  law  itself,  a  massive  number  of  instructions  and  rules  on  the\nimplementation  of  laws  were  produced.  Ministers  and  agencies  started\n\u201ccompeting\u201d for the production of different instructions and regulations. Other\nsources  of  trouble  came  in  the  form  of  regulations  that  were  sometimes\nunrelated  and  legislation  that  was  contradictory,  copied  from  the  laws  of\ncountries with a different level of development and different legal systems.\nThere were also amendments to the laws based on specific \u201ctiny\u201d interests\n(Amarsanaa  2002,  page  81).  These  difficulties  of  reregulation  caused  a\nrethinking about the process itself.\n\nBecause of this, Mongolia did not intend to deregulate government with\nthe introduction of the NPM reforms. The Government attempted to build\nboth effective managerialism and formal administrative rules and procedures\nwith strong ethical regulations. If some countries implementing public service\nreform  throw  out  the  10,000-plus  pages  of  personnel  regulations  amassed\nover the decades and discard their rules permitting departments to purchase\nmost materials and services on their own (Peters 2001, page 100), Mongolia\ntook the opposite direction of change. The Government started adopting and\nenforcing new personnel and purchasing rules and regulations. In order to\nprevent corruption and preferential contracting, it established and enforced\nrules for procurement and purchasing, requiring elaborate bidding procedures\nfor even small purchases (Government of Mongolia 2000). However, these\nrules and biding processes did not prevent government officials from making\npurchases in ways that involved corruption and preferential contracting.\n\nIn the transitional period, on the one hand, there is a need for deregulation\nor dismissal of the communist era\u2019s rigid and arbitrary regulations and controls\nof  the  public  bureaucracy.  At  the  same  time,  in  order  to  function  at  least\nwithin  some  boundaries  and  strategic  direction,  transitional  public  service\nneeds new, flexible, democratic regulations and controls. For this reason the\ntransitional regime requested deregulation from the communist legacy and\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n537\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f538\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nreregulation  in  a  new  democratic  way.  In  the  end  the  public  service  of  a\ntransitional regime needs as much deregulation as it needs reregulation.\n\nThe Mixed Model of Government Reform\n\nAfter  the  collapse  of  the  communist  regime,  Mongolia  was  left  with\n\u201cunregulated\u201d and highly \u201cflexible\u201d governance. In order to achieve some degree\nof stability and predictability, it developed a rule-bound traditional public\nadministration  system.  This  was  followed  by  the  introduction  of  the\nmanagerialist  approach  of  the  market  model,  promoting  efficiency  and\naccountability. Imposing a new output-based, contractual market model at\nthe same time, the Mongolian Government hopes to maintain and strengthen\na merit-based, centralized traditional system of civil service. Furthermore, in\norder to promote law and order, new rules and regulations were brought into\nthe governing process. In addition, the Good Governance program was initiated\nto facilitate transparency and citizens\u2019 participation in all levels of civil service\ndecision making.\n\nAs was suggested by international consultants and donor organizations\n(Laking  2000),  the  Mongolian  Government  decided  to  establish  effective\ncentral control over the budget, staff, and auditing as a necessary prior step to\nthe introduction of a market model of public service. Government established\ncentral control over the budget by creating a Treasury Single Account system\nin the Ministry of Finance and Economics. According to this system, all public\norganizations are requested to have only one account under the control of the\nministry and to have their expenditures for each month preapproved at the\nbeginning of the month. In addition, amending the LGS increased central\ncontrol over staff, especially over the recruitment and promotion of senior\ncivil servants. A centralized monitoring body was created by strengthening\nthe State Auditing Authority\u2019s responsibility to conduct annual, mandatory\nauditing of all government organizations.\n\nImposing  NPM  reforms  has  not  removed  the  ex  ante  control  over\npersonnel,  purchasing,  and  budgeting,  but  introduced  ex  post  control  by\ncombining two mechanisms of control into one system. The development of\nthe rule-bound traditional public administration system did not encourage\naccountability among public bureaucrats in many post-communist countries.\nThe  traditional  approach  to  accountability  required  public  bureaucrats  to\ncomply with rule-bound, standardized behavior as the basis for \u201cerror-free\ngovernment\u201d and fair service (Thomas 2003). In contrast, bureaucrats and\ncitizens  in  the  transitional  regimes  were  not  respectful  of  the  rules  and\nregulations. Therefore, the Mongolian Government decided to introduce new\nperformance  accountability,  but  not  by  shifting  from  compliance\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n538\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f Institutional Change in Mongolia:  Balancing Waves of Reform\n\n539\n\naccountability.  Instead,  it  enforces  both  at  the  same  time.  Thus,  public\norganizations now face double accountability: more accountability for results\nwith more procedural regulation.\n\nMongolia perceived NPM reform as a performance- and output-oriented\nimprovement of the traditional system of public service, not as a replacement\nor dismantling of the traditional system. This was a consensus that was reached\nafter 5 years of extensive debate between 1997 and 2002 over maintaining the\ntraditional system or imposing the NPM model.\n\nIn Mongolia, contradictions are emerging between the transition from\nthe  communist  administration  to  the  traditional  system  of  public\nadministration and attempts to introduce NPM reforms into the new system.\nIf the traditional system and the transitional character of public administration\nrequires a more regulated, stable, and centralized approach, the market-based\nNPM reform requires deregulation, decentralization, and flexibility. In order\nto combine the development of a new system and reform of the system, along\nwith traditional and NMP approaches to public administration, Mongolia\nparadoxically seems to be intending to accomplish decentralization through\nhighly  centralized  mechanisms,  deregulation  through  highly  regulatory\nmechanisms, flexibility through permanency mechanisms, and participation\nwithin the hierarchy. The transition that started with the goal of establishing\nstable, predictable, and professional public administration generated ambitious\nreform objectives that tried to cover all the e\u2019s (economy, efficiency, effectiveness,\nethics, equalities, and equity) as well as other modern reform objectives like\naccountability  and  customer  orientation.  One  of  the  characteristics  of  the\nMongolian public administration transition is that its reform process is moving\nfaster than in many other transitional countries, incorporating most common\nconcepts and elements from \u201ca shopping basket\u201d (Pollitt 1995) of the NPM,\nand contemporary trajectories of civil service reform. Mongolia transition has\nthus ended up as a mixed model of reform.\n\nAs we can see from the most recent policy document on reforming public\nadministration, Civil Service Reform Medium-Term Strategy (2004), within\nthe NPM reform the Mongolian Government is trying to find some balance\nbetween  the  characteristics  of  a  centrally  regulated  career  system  and\ncompetitive, performance-based personnel management. Specifying the balance\nof elements and characteristics of the different models is the biggest challenge\nfor public administration reform in transitional regimes. These countries cannot\nimpose NPM without establishing a traditional system, but they also cannot\nstay only with a traditional model of public service in a global environment.\nTransitional  regimes  need  to  establish  a  public  administration  system  that\nreflects the specifics of the country and balances the characteristics of traditional\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n539\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f540\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\npublic administration with the positive benefits of NPM. In the transitional\nregimes that are emerging from dictatorship, one-party domination, and state\nmonopoly, where any sign of bureaucracy and extreme position is seen as a\nlegacy of the past, it is difficult to impose a strong type of traditional public\nadministration. This  is  especially  true  in  Mongolia,  a  small  society  with  a\ntraditional  nomadic  culture,  and  a  style  of  life  with  extreme  and  rapid\nliberalization, both of which mean that the traditional bureaucratic model of\nmanagement  is  no  longer  favored.  The  requirement  of  balancing  the\ncharacteristics of the traditional system and the important values of NPM in\nthe establishment of the public service in transitional regimes is apparent.\n\nFactors Determining the Mixed Model in Mongolian\nPublic Administration Transition\n\nA transitional society is not a communist regime, but it is also not yet a\nmarket system. It has elements from both systems. Public administration in\ntransitional regimes needs a stable, regulated, traditional character as much as\nflexible,  participatory,  market  mechanisms.  First,  the  transition  is  a  more\nunpredictable, mostly unique process that requires from administration a more\nentrepreneurial,  flexible  approach  rather  than  the  regulated,  standardized\napproach  that  has  been  part  of  the  Western  market  system.  Many  events,\nprograms, procedures, regulations, and decisions in transition are first-time\nprocesses that were not present before and will not be repeated again. In this\nrespect, transitional regimes require more NPM-like approaches from public\nemployees  rather  than  traditional,  standardized  approaches.  Second,  the\ntransition from an authoritarian system to a market society is taking place in\nmore  open,  democratic,  participatory,  and  global  conditions  than  market\nregimes used to have in the time of the Cold War. Public service in the new\nsociety  needs  to  be  more  democratic  and  market-oriented. Transition  is  a\nmixture of the characteristics of different systems from different times and\nperspectives. This society may need a more complicated system of public service.\nOn the one hand, transitional regimes need to establish some stability and\npredictability,  but,  on  other  hand,  they  also  need  to  promote  democratic\nchanges. In order to achieve some degree stability and predictability in public\nservice,  transitional  regimes  must  build  a  traditional  system  of  public\nadministration. But in order to promote change and produce efficiency and\neffectiveness in public service and cope with social and economic development,\nthese  regimes  need  to  introduce  NPM  reform.  This  is  one  reason  to\nsimultaneously accomplish the developmental and reformist tasks of public\nadministration in the post-communist regimes.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n540\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f Institutional Change in Mongolia:  Balancing Waves of Reform\n\n541\n\nAll  new  models  are  made  up  of  elements  added  to  the  traditional\nadministration in order to achieve more effective and efficient service. One\nway for a transitional regime to introduce a new model of administration is to\nestablish first traditional public administration or a traditional system with\nnew  elements.  A  more  effective  way  to  transition  is  establishing  a  public\nadministration system with NPM elements from the beginning of the transition\nrather than starting with a traditional system and introducing civil service\nreform  midway.  Changing  direction  in  the  middle  of  a  transition  without\nstrategic planning from the beginning is not just ineffective and inefficient.\nChanges like that interrupt processes, slow energy and enthusiasm for previous\nchange, generate uncertainty and disbelief, and require time for discussion to\novercome  the  resistance  to  the  reform.  Mongolia  started  by  adopting  a\ntraditional system of public service and then began discussion about NPM\nreforms  in  the  middle  of  the  transition.  It  took  5  years  to  overcome\nmisunderstanding  and  resistance,  reach  consensus,  and  adopt  the  law  and\nregulations and introduce reform.\n\nIn a global world, the public service transition of any country cannot be\ndetermined by internal conditions alone. Much as one cannot ignore internal\nfactors, neither can one ignore external factors. International conditions \u201cpush\u201d\nNPM reform onto the public administration system of the post-communist\ncountries. The adoption of neoliberal, market-embracing reforms is typically\na condition for the approval of loans and other benefits (Dimitrakopoulos\nand Passas 2003, page 447). If the internal conditions of post-communist\nregimes stand more for public administration development of the traditional\nbureaucratic system, the external conditions push more for NPM reform (Pratt\n2005).\n\nMongolia today is an extremely mixed society with the coexistence of\nnomadic  and  modern  lifestyles;  European  and  Asian  cultures;  former\ncommunist and modern market ideology, and ethics; and Romano-Germanic\nand Anglo-Saxon legal and administrative systems. Given this, a mixed or \u201call\nin one\u201d approach is the common method of organizing and making decisions,\nnot only for everyday life, but for socioeconomic, political, and administrative\nprocesses. The \u201ccombining approach\u201d to social transition and reform started\nwith constitutional reform. Mongolia is a parliamentary republic with a directly\nelected president as head of state (Constitution of Mongolia, 1992, chapter 3,\nparts 1, 2). According to the Constitution, \u201cGovernance of administrative\nand  territorial  units  of  Mongolia  shall  be  organized  on  the  basis  of  a\ncombination  of  the  principles  of  both  self-government  and  Central\nGovernment\u201d (chapter 4, article 59). In other parts of the Constitution we\ncan see attempts to combine \u201cthe tradition of national statehood, history and\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n541\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f542\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nculture\u201d  and  \u201cthe  accomplishments  of  human  civilization\u201d  (Preface). The\ntraditional public administration system at the beginning of transition already\nhad a mixed character. Principles and elements of the new system were selected\nfrom different concepts and a different set of assumptions. If the main principles\nof the civil service system were based on the career system, some elements\nwere drawn from job systems like training, recruitment, and promotion. Many\nelements  were  selected  from  the  civil  service  practices  of  countries  with  a\ndifferent public administration system like Germany, Japan, Republic of Korea,\nSweden, the UK, and the US. Some civil service management elements, like\nmanagement by objectives, costumer-oriented management, and performance\nmanagement, were selected from NPM and adapted to a traditional civil service\nsystem.\n\nAnother reason that the Mongolian public administration system came\nto be a mixed model is political liberalization and the consensual character of\ntransitional policies. In societies where there is little respect for laws and rules,\nwhere informal relations stand above formal rules and regulations, to establish\na strong, centrally controlled, rule-bound bureaucracy, it is necessary to have\npermanent backing from a stable majoritarian political regime. For example,\na high degree of political stability without a fully developed political party\nsystem characterizes the comparatively successful implementation of the reform\nprocesses in Kazakhstan to date (Verheijen 2003, page 495). On the contrary,\nMongolia is characterized by political pluralism rather than a stable majoritarian\nregime. The political party system is polarized between ex-communists and\nthe opposition democratic parties, and voters have been rotating them in office\nduring elections. Accordingly, it was not possible for any single interest or\npolicy  to  establish  stability.  Because  of  this,  in  its  public  administration\ntransition policy Mongolia tried to reach consensus among all interests. These\nincluded the interests of core civil servants and other public employees, elected\nofficials, citizens, and all international donor organizations. This approach\ntended to create change without \u201closers,\u201d so that the losing interest was directly\nrepresented in the new system. This balance may be possible only in mixed\nsystems  of  public  administration  to  some  degree.  Furthermore,  after  the\nelections of 2004, Mongolia\u2019s opposing political parties\u2014former communists\nand democratic coalitions\u2014not only established a coalition government but\norganized a joint coalition in the Parliament. As Pollitt and Bouckaert (2000,\npage  48)  state,  consensual  regimes,  whose  innovations  have  longer  life\nexpectancies,  are  politically  less  susceptible  to  deep,  radical  reforms  than\nmajoritarian regimes.\n\nWhenever the adopted system of public administration in a transitional\nregime  does  not  work  well,  the  common  reaction  is  to  impose  one  of  the\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n542\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\n\f Institutional Change in Mongolia:  Balancing Waves of Reform\n\n543\n\nemerging models of public administration on top of the existing one. The\nNPM reforms in transitional regimes tend to pile new models on top of newly\nestablished civil service systems. It is better to adopt a mixed system of public\nservice from the beginning of transition instead of piling one model on top of\nanother. Furthermore, the process of organizing government in transition has\nbeen to start with one reform from one donor and add on top of it another\nreform  from  another  donor  in  a  cumulative  fashion.  Because  reform  was\ninitiated and sponsored from different sources and supported inside the country\nby different political and administrative powers, it soon is not easy to find the\nright balance among the administrative dualisms.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nMany  important  administrative  issues  exist  as  dualisms  among  these\ncontradictory factors (Peters 2001), and the solutions for the organizational\nproblems then tend to come in opposing pairs (Simon 1947, cited in Peters\n2001). Reform may be seen as a continuing search for the right balance among\nfactors in the administrative structure (Peters 2001)\u2014something true for all\ngovernments, including transitional regimes. In the case of Mongolia, instead\nof choosing one direction for reform as the best solution, or going in one\ndirection and then switching to the opposite direction, there has been a search\nfor the right balance among the contradicting factors. The Mongolian approach\nof a mixed model of reform has not achieved a proper balancing of conflicting\nelements and factors so far. An important issue for further Mongolian public\nadministration reform processes is to clarify these contradicting features of\nchange and find the most suitable balance in the process of change. This, of\ncourse, must be done while being realistic about what is feasible given the\neconomic,  social,  and  cultural  resources  and  emerging,  often  competing,\ninterests.\n\nSession3-2.pmd\n\n543\n\n20/11/2006, 3:17 PM\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\f544\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nReferences\n\nAmarsanaa, J. 2002.

Fertility and birth rates dropped and the death rate declined2 (see\nfigure) following the transition to independence and the market economy,\naccompanied  by  sharp  political  and  economic  shocks  and  a  period  of\ncontinuous instability, the sudden shift to a new environment with significantly\ngreater risks and uncertainties, the end of massive subsidies from the central\nSoviet budget, and the resulting decline in the quantity and quality of social\nservices. The natural population growth rate fell from 24.1% in 1987 (the\nlast \u201cquiet\u201d year of the Soviet period) to 14.7% in 2004. Still, the population\nis growing relatively fast; in 2005, it reached 5.1 million people, or 0.6 million\nmore  than  in  1991,  when  the\ncountry gained independence.\n\nDemographic Trends in the\nKyrgyz Republic, 1987\u20132004\n\nThe  population  is  predomi-\nnantly rural (65% of the population)\nand young (children compose about\n40% of the population; about half\nof the population is of working age).\nThe issue of employment, especially\nrural employment, is therefore very\nacute. While official unemployment\nfigures  are  rather  low  (registered\nunemployment  is  just  3%,  and\nestimated unemployment as defined\nby  the  International  Labour\nOrganization is 9%), these figures\nassume  that  all  peasants  with  a\npiece  of  land  are  employed.\n\nl\n\ne\np\no\ne\np\n \n0\n0\n0\n,\n1\n \nr\ne\np\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n32.7\n\n4.1\n\n8.6\n\n1987\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n21.6\n\n2.5\n\nn\na\nm\no\nw\n\n \nr\ne\np\n\n6.9\n\n2004\n\n19.7\n\n2.6\n\n6.9\n\n2000\n\nbirth rate (lhs)\n\ndeath rate (lhs)\n\nfertility rate (rhs)\n\n* Note: lhs \u2013 left-hand side axis, rhs \u2013 right-hand side axis\n\nSource:  World  Bank,  World  Development  Indicators;  National\nStatistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\n1\n\nExecutive Director, Center for Social and Economic Research (CASE), Bishkek, the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\n2 The decline in mortality is mainly due to the decline in infant mortality rate (from 69 per 1,000 live\nbirths in 1990 to 52 in 2002, according to the World Development Indicators) which, in turn, is a\nconsequence of reduced fertility rate.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 4.pmd\n\n549\n\n20/11/2006, 3:20 PM\n\n\f550\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nBecause land and agrarian reform in the 1990s gave land to virtually every\npeasant,  there  is  no  rural  unemployment,  according  to  official  records.  In\nreality,  however,  since  the  collapse  of  the  previous  mode  of  agricultural\nproduction,  based  on  extensive  use  of  resources  and  permanent  inflow  of\nsubsidies to large agricultural enterprises, agricultural activities have not been\nable to feed the growing rural population. A natural response to this situation\nis the migration of young people from rural to urban areas and, increasingly,\nabroad in search of employment opportunities. Migration has become a major\nsocial and economic phenomenon in the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\nMigration Pattern in the Country\n\nMigration both from and to the Kyrgyz Republic has been traditionally\nlarge since the end of the 19th century. However, in the pre-Soviet and especially\nin  the  Soviet  period,  migration  was  mainly  immigration  from  Russia  and\nUkraine and was forced or organized (Cossack settlers in pre-Soviet times,\nevacuees during World War II, specialists and skilled workers participating in\npostwar industrialization, students); voluntary migration was marginal. The\nsituation changed dramatically after independence. There was a large outflow\nof people in the early 1990s. All emigrated voluntarily for ethnic identity and\neconomic reasons. All these migrations (apart from those of students) were\nassociated with a permanent change of residence. Recently, however, there has\nbeen a new trend: temporary migration driven exclusively by economic reasons.\nThe temporary migrants are mainly ethnic Kyrgyz, but ethnic minorities\nare  also  well  represented. This  makes  the  phenomenon  different  from  the\npermanent migrations, where the migrants were mostly minorities (mainly\nRussians, Ukrainians, and Germans). The main destinations of the temporary\nmigrants are Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation (especially the Urals and\nSiberia). The total number of migrants from the Kyrgyz Republic is not known\nas there are no reliable official statistics. By conservative estimates, 160,000\u2013\n200,000 people from the Kyrgyz Republic, or about 10% of the labor force of\nslightly  more  than  2  million,  are  working  abroad.  The  Department  of\nMigration Service of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs provides larger estimates:\n300,000  people  working  in  the  Russian  Federation,  40,000\u201380,000  in\nKazakhstan, and 20,000 in Western Europe (Italy, United Kingdom, and other\ncountries), Republic of Korea, Turkey, and United States. Journalists say the\ntotal  numbers  are  closer  to  500,000\u2013700,000,  but  these  figures  seem  too\nsubjective and unfounded.\n\nThe reasons for migration are mostly economic. Living standards, wages,\nemployment,  and  market  opportunities  are  significantly  higher  in  oil-rich\nKazakhstan and the Russian Federation than in the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan,\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 4.pmd\n\n550\n\n20/11/2006, 3:20 PM\n\n\fLabor Migration in the Kyrgyz Republic and its Social and Economic Consequences\n\n551\n\nor Uzbekistan. Migrants fill niches in the labor markets of Kazakhstan and\nthe Russian Federation that their citizens do not find as attractive as other\nemployment options. Apart from economic reasons, the migrants choose to\ngo  to  Kazakhstan  and  the  Russian  Federation  because  they  speak  Russian\n(universally spoken by people in their 30s and 40s in the Kyrgyz Republic,\nbut  less  common  among  younger  people)  or  (for  those  less  conversant  in\nRussian)  find  the  Kazakh  language  not  much  different  from  the  Kyrgyz\nlanguage,  and  because  of  cultural  kinship  with  the  other  former  Soviet\nrepublics.\n\nInterestingly, relatively few temporary migrants from the Kyrgyz Republic\nwork for hire; most are self-employed or small entrepreneurs, mainly in trade\nbut  also  in  services. This  circumstance  is  often  overlooked  when  the  legal\nstatus  of  migrants  is  discussed  because  people  (and  policy  makers)  think\ntraditionally of migrant hiring rules, while the right for and conditions of\nself-employment and entrepreneurial activity are much more important for\nthe migrants from the Kyrgyz Republic. Labor migration to Kazakhstan has a\nspecific  purpose:  migrants  from  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  work  in  agriculture,\ngrowing crops like tobacco, where they have much more experience than the\nlocal peasants.\n\nIt  is  worth  noting  that  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  not  only  supplies  labor\nmigrants to other countries but also receives them from other countries, mainly\nfrom Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. These immigrants work in agriculture and\nconstruction and successfully compete in the domestic labor market of the\nKyrgyz Republic with their attractive combination of skill, readiness to work\nfor modest pay (even by Kyrgyz Republic standards), and good work ethic.\nAgain, there are no reliable statistics on these immigrants as they largely work\non an informal basis, but there are certainly thousands of immigrant workers\nduring the agricultural season in the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\nWhile economically motivated migration is the core of all intercountry\nhuman  flows  in  the  region,  the  movement  of  people  for  business  (non-\nemployment) and personal needs is also quite intensive. This is very easily\nunderstandable, if one accounts for the still close economic, cultural, scientific,\nand  (last  but  not  least)  family  ties  among  the  people  of  Central  Asia.\nUnfortunately,  this  movement  is  hindered  by  the  visa  regime  for  Kyrgyz\nRepublic citizens in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, complicated registration\nrules in Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation, and burdensome border checks\nat virtually all borders. Given government corruption and ineffectiveness in\nthe region, these measures only serve to create problems for ordinary people\nand  do  not  discourage  those  involved  in  illegal  activities,  who  should  be\nprevented from crossing the borders.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 4.pmd\n\n551\n\n20/11/2006, 3:20 PM\n\n\f552\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nEconomic and Social Implications of Migration\n\nThe availability of such a large labor force working abroad has numerous\neconomic, social, and human implications for the Kyrgyz Republic. From the\neconomic standpoint, migration has two positive consequences: (i) reduced\nunemployment in the country, and (ii) even more importantly, large inflow of\nremittances  from  the  migrant  workers. The  National  Bank  of  the  Kyrgyz\nRepublic has estimated incoming remittances in 2004 at $179 million.3 This\nfigure takes into account only the money sent through financial institutions\n(mainly Western Union and the like); however, it is well known that a large\npart  of  money  is  in  cash,  brought  back  by  people  when  they  periodically\nreturn  home  to  see  their  families  or  sent  through  relatives,  friends,  and\nneighbors. By different estimates, the remittances may reach $300 million, or\nmuch more than gross foreign direct investment. Many experts believe that\nthe remittances are a main reason for the reduction in poverty in the last few\nyears. The remittances have also reduced inequality because migrants generally\ncome from families that are not rich. This money mainly goes to personal\nconsumption or is saved or invested in housing; in the last 3 years real estate\nprices in Bishkek and Osh (the largest towns in the country) increased four-\nor fivefold. Unfortunately, the concentration of remittances in the capital and\nthe largest towns and their limited use for productive investments has increased\nregional inequality in the Kyrgyz Republic and reduced the potential positive\nimpact  on  the  economy.  Another  less  positive  effect  of  migration  on  the\ndomestic situation is the outflow of young and well-educated people, who\neasily  find  employment  in  much  less  competitive  markets  in  Almaty,\nKazakhstan, or in Moscow and other Russian Federation cities. On the other\nhand, the possibility of finding well-paid employment abroad supports the\ninflow of young people to universities in the Kyrgyz Republic, especially those\nwith a reputation for providing good education.\n\nUntil recently, despite the obvious large importance of migration in the\neconomic and social development of the Kyrgyz Republic and the recipient\ncountries,  governments  paid  too  little  attention  to  its  less  fortunate\nconsequences. The legal status of migrants abroad is unclear, especially for the\nself-employed and those employed in agriculture; migrants who are hired for\nurban jobs in the Russian Federation are now subject to protectionist legislation,\nwhich  makes  it  more  costly  to  hire  foreign  migrants.  Getting  temporary\nregistration  in  Russian  Federation  cities  poses  much  greater  difficulties.\nTherefore, official employment opportunities are not many, and people work\nmostly in the shadow economy with no legal protection. This makes them\n\n3\n\n8.1% of GDP at the current exchange rate.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 4.pmd\n\n552\n\n20/11/2006, 3:20 PM\n\n\fLabor Migration in the Kyrgyz Republic and its Social and Economic Consequences\n\n553\n\nvery vulnerable to exploitation and crime, and leaves them without good access\nto health care and education for their children.\n\nNow the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic is addressing these problems\nby  concluding  agreements  whereby  its  migrants  would  be  granted  a  more\nstable status by the central and regional governments of Kazakhstan and the\nRussian  Federation.  An  important  direction  of  support  to  migrants  is  the\nestablishment of recruitment companies in the Kyrgyz Republic, to organize\nmigration according to the legislation of recipient countries and provide needed\nlegal  guarantees  to  the  workers. The  Governments  of  Kazakhstan  and  the\nRussian  Federation  also  have  the  creation  of  such  companies  in  mind.\nObviously, the Kyrgyz Republic must also develop a migration policy that\ntakes into account the long-term nature of migration and its potential for\nfurther expansion in view of the reduced population in the Russian Federation\nand the still high population growth in the Kyrgyz Republic. The policy should\nnot only protect the legal rights of the country\u2019s migrants abroad, but also\nprovide them with training suitable for the target labor markets, create hiring\ninfrastructure,  strengthen  the  financial  infrastructure  for  migrants  to  send\nmoney back safely, among other measures. This policy should be developed\nwith  the  participation  of  migrants;  however,  they  have  not  yet  organized\nthemselves to become a partner in discussions with the Government.\n\nLabor immigration requires a proper policy response as well. Recently,\nlabor migrants from Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have become so visible and\ncompetitive that the Parliament of the Kyrgyz Republic (Jogorku Kenesh)\neven attempted to introduce a protectionist measure against immigrant workers\nwho would set their deductions for the Social Fund at a prohibitively high\nrate (100% of their wage, compared with 25% for Kyrgyz hired workers). But\nsuch a policy, like others of this kind, would not solve the problem as migrants\nremain in the shadow economy, but would only create unnecessary distortions\nin the domestic labor market.\n\nLabor migration has recently emerged as an important item: the country\u2019s\nlong-term  development  agenda.  It  requires  a  proper  regulatory  and  policy\nenvironment, which has yet to be created. The Government and the society of\nthe Kyrgyz Republic are just at the very start of this process.\n\nSession 4.pmd\n\n553\n\n20/11/2006, 3:20 PM\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\f554\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nReferences\n\nWorld Development Indicators 2005.

The future of people,\neconomies, societies, and the state lies in their population dynamics. On the\nother  hand,  the  future  of  population  dynamics  also  lies  in  the  future  of\neconomies and societies, and the ideals, plans, and programs of government.\nDemographic statistics are essential in assessing growth and development,\ndetermining educational capabilities, drafting plans, and drawing up economic\npolicies.  Demographic  data  are  analyzed  to  answer  basic  questions  about\neconomic  development,  labor  force  participation,  occupational  structure,\nemployment status, use of manpower, and distribution of literacy in technical\nand vocational fields. Demographic data are helpful in examining the types,\nquantity, and quality of major public facilities like water, electricity, and basic\nhealth units within given geographic areas. Indeed, population concerns must\nbe central, not peripheral, to the programs of government.\n\nDemographic  analysis  helps  to  gain  knowledge  about  unsettled  and\nnomadic people. It elaborates migration trends and effects on community life.\nDemographers highlight the relationship between the distribution of resources\nand the population, and forecast labor force trends and needs. Is there capability,\nfor example, to absorb rural migrants? The demographic study explains the\ngeographic and occupational transfers, the rural to urban shifts, the areas and\nextent of the pressures, the sufficiency or insufficiencies of the opportunities.\n\nDemographic Imbalance\n\nDemographic  imbalance  is  a  mismatch  of  population  and  resources.\nAccording to a United Nations report released on 25 August 2005 (The Daily\nNews, 29 August 2005, page 17):\n\nthe  gap  between  the  world\u2019s  rich  and  poor  is  getting  bigger.  Inequality\nbetween the world\u2019s richest and poorest nations has grown progressively\n\n1 Assistant Professor, Department of International Relations, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 4.pmd\n\n555\n\n20/11/2006, 3:20 PM\n\n\f556\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nworse  over  the  last  10  years.  Some  80  percent  of  the  world\u2019s  domestic\nproduct belongs to 1 billion people living in the developed world, while\nthe remaining 20 percent is shared by 5.5 billion people living in developing\ncountries. The poorest countries have fallen even further behind the richest\ncountries. The disparity has been widened between the income of the poor\nand the income of the rich.\n\nThe inequality could be in income or in access to basic social services\nand decision making. The widening of the gap shows that governments are\nunable to confront profound social challenges and place people at the center\nof development.\n\nChallenges and Constraints\n\nSerious gaps in available information and in the amount and quality of\ndata  must  be  eliminated.  Sometimes  the  data  are  not  accurate  in  the  first\nplace because people tend not to provide information to (official) government\nworkers for fear of harassment. People do not trust data collection agencies\nand their objectives. In developing countries, the government sometimes tends\nto use the data for political ends. Figures are sometimes inflated. For instance,\nPakistan\u2019s  literacy  rate  placed  at  53%    (Islamabad,  Planning  Commission,\nGovernment of  Pakistan: Pakistan Economic Survey 2004\u20132005, page 138).\nIn 1951, when Pakistan had its first census, the country had a population\nof 34 million. In the most recent census in 1998, the population was 134\nmillion, and the Pakistan Economic Survey 2004\u20132005 placed the figure at\nclose to 150 million. A census is a vast undertaking that needs much planning,\nadequate  resources,  control,  and  trained  enumerators.  An  increasingly\nimportant function of the demographer is developing survey techniques for\ncollecting information about the family structure, way of life, quality of life,\nand family planning (not only birth control but also resource distribution).\nInadequate  and  unreliable  population  statistics  make  it  very  difficult  to\nformulate effective plans for social and economic development.\n\nBut  the  predictability  of  population  dynamics  is  less  useful  without\npredictable economic and social development. To maintain balance in a society,\nbasic needs like food must be provided for increasing numbers. Pakistan, once\nconsidered the breadbasket of the area, now does not even have half a basketful\nand must import basic food items like potatoes, garlic, and onions from India.\nPakistan  receives  600  sacks  of  potatoes  from  India  daily  (Ocampo  2005).\nHow was this population imbalance created in a country with agriculture as a\nbackbone of the economy and about 70% of the people are in the villages? A\nmajor cause is migration.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 4.pmd\n\n556\n\n20/11/2006, 3:20 PM\n\n\fConstraints and Challenges Arising from Demographic Transitions and Imbalances in Pakistan\n\n557\n\nMigration is as old as the need of human beings to have a better life. Its\nimpact on a country and on the migrants themselves is profound. The whole\npattern of politics, economy, and social values and norms can change as a\nresult (The Daily Nawa-i-Waqt, 7 August 2005). Migration is a process of\nchanging residence and moving the migrant\u2019s social activities from one place\nto  another  (Rizvi,  Farzana.  2005.  International  Migration  and  Pakistan.\nPakistan Vision 6(1 July): page 97). Migrants generally attach themselves to\nareas where economic opportunities are abundant and where they will receive\nbetter pay for their work (Weeks 1992, page 223). Migration can be explained\nby a variety of socioeconomic conditions. It can be free or forced. People in\nPakistan migrated to seek safer areas during the floods of June\u2013July 2005, and\nto escape drought in Cholistan and Thar. Whatever the cause of the migration\nmay be, the balance of the host place is disrupted.\n\nIn the developing world, migration is most remarkable in its rural-urban\nform, often the main cause of the so-called urban explosion. Thousands of\nThird World peasants leave their villages daily to find permanent or temporary\nshelter elsewhere (Selier 1988, page 7). The main driving force is the search\nfor jobs and for refuge from a difficult situation. In Islamabad, 58% of the\npeople come from different areas. These include not only the proper job seekers\nbut also the gypsies, who wander from place to place before settling in a spot\nclose to the road but away from the local population, where daily food needs\nand water are available. A few years ago, empty plots were easy to find. Now,\nwith commercialization, it is difficult to get one. In Lahore\u2019s upscale localities,\nempty plots rent for as much as PRs600 a month.\n\nIn the 21st century, gypsies still live the traditional way, totally different\nfrom the rest. Their unity is their main characteristic. They provide cheap\nlabor in the cities and put up with extreme weather conditions. Some male\ngypsies earn about PRs200\u2013300 a day pulling donkey carts (Selier 1988, page\n11). Others earn a living with magic tricks, while a few simply stay home.\nGypsy women make very good housemaids. A major part of the gypsy economy\nis run by females. In the villages, they sell small items on barter.\n\nAbout  15  million  people  live  as  gypsies  in  Pakistan.  In  Lahore,  they\nnumber more than 50,000 and the number is constantly rising (Weekly Family\nMagazine, 18\u201324 September 2005, pages 10\u201328) because the gypsies move\nconstantly from place to place and do not get themselves registered at birth\nand  get  identity  cards.  Most  of  them  cannot  vote.  But  their  dwellings\nunfortunately dispense with hygiene and pose health problems, especially in\nthe rainy season. Another negative aspect is the incidence of thefts and fraud.\nThree hundred gypsy children were arrested for theft in Lahore in September\n2005 (Weekly Family Magazine, 18\u201324 September 2005, pages 10\u201328).

Today, urbanites make up more than 32% of the population, having\nleft behind fertile agricultural lands and forests to build businesses and houses\nin the cities. The rapid urbanization, at 4.9% a year, reflects the urban bias of\nstate investment. Pakistan is projected to be predominantly urban by the next\ndecade  (The  Daily  News,  30  August  2005). More  than  half  of  the  urban\npopulation is in the eight big cities of Karachi, Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi,\nMultan, Hyderabad, Gujranwala, and Peshawar. According to the 1998 census,\nSindh is the most urbanized province with 49% of the population in urban\ncenters, followed by Punjab with 31%, Balochistan with 24%, and the North-\nWest Frontier Province (NWFP) with 17%. The proportion of migrants from\nother provinces is significant in Sindh, while shifts to urban areas in Punjab\nand NWFP are mostly from within the province. In Karachi, more than 38%\nof the immigrants are from Punjab (The Daily News, 2 October 2005).\n\nThe population shift requires more land and space to settle. Class I and\nII agricultural land is taken up by city dwellers because it is level and easy to\ndevelop. Fertile land is sold at lucrative prices. There are no controls over the\nacquisition of agricultural land for housing. The demographic imbalance is\nresponsible for many problems.\n\nShocks and Their Effects\n\nHarsh socioeconomic inequalities and struggles over meager resources\nbring  violence  and  terror.  Failure  to  pursue  a  comprehensive  integrated\napproach to development will perpetuate the inequalities, for which every\none pays the price (The Daily News, 2 October 2005). The society faces a host\nof important problems in this regard.\n\nPoverty\n\nAccording to the Human Development Index of the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (2005), Pakistan in 2003\u20132004 ranked 144th in\npoverty indices; in 2001\u20132002, it was 138th from 175 countries. Six million\nfamilies in Pakistan live below the poverty line. According to the State Bank\nof Pakistan (October 2005), unemployment is at 36% and 41% of the people\nlive below the poverty line. The top 20% own 43.3% of the wealth, while the\npoorest  20%  must  make  do  with  3.7%  of  the  national  wealth. The  gross\ndomestic product (GDP) may have grown by 8.4% in 2005 but the growth\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 4.pmd\n\n558\n\n20/11/2006, 3:20 PM\n\n\fConstraints and Challenges Arising from Demographic Transitions and Imbalances in Pakistan\n\n559\n\nhas not reached the masses. Investment in big cities has not trickled down.\nInstead, the wealth of villages goes to the cities and only a very small part\ncomes back. The lack of rural industrialization deprives the rural masses of\nthe benefits of development. Meanwhile, poverty-driven migration from the\nrural to the urban areas proceeds, posing severe threats to economic, social,\nand physical conditions.\n\nPoor Land Utilization\n\nThe cities, already overcrowded, are choked further with the flood of\nmigrants.  Problems  related  to  jobs,  food  and  water,  sanitation,  and\ntransportation have become even more acute. Despite being an agricultural\ncountry, Pakistan imports its vegetables, spices, beans, and meat. Agriculture\nlacks solid planning. As the cities have expanded into nearby agricultural lands,\nuncultivated land has been left unused. Of the total land area of 803,940 km2,\n60% is not cultivated. A third of the farmers give half of their yield to landlords;\n\u201c0.1 percent of landlords control 15 percent of all cultivable land\u201d (The Daily\nNews, 2 October 2005). Consumers, on the other hand, spend 60% of their\nincome on food and utilities and spend a great deal less on clothing, medicines,\nand education (The Daily Nawa-i-Waqt, 18 September 2005). A survey in\nOctober 2005 by the Statistics Department of Pakistan showed that 75% of\nthe population is not satisfied with the economy. About 27% of the youth\ncapable  of  employment  are  unemployed.  Policies  favor  the  elite  while  the\nbulk of population does not benefit and many even have reduced incomes\nespecially in the rural areas.\n\nLow Public Investment in Agriculture\n\nAgriculture\u2019s share in the recent budget, 2004\u20132005 is PRs 9.1 billion,\n($1 dollar is equivalent to Rs60 or $151.66 million) or 4.5% of the development\nbudget. Agriculture contributes 24% of the national income but receives only\n0.15% of GDP in government investment (The Daily Nawa-i-Waqt, August\n2005).\n\nEcological Imbalance\n\nThe population of cities is ever increasing as people look for jobs, security,\nhealth and education services, and generally better living conditions, and the\ncities pay a heavy toll. The landscape is a mix of overly crowded mega cities,\ndecaying intermediate cities, paralyzed secondary cities and towns, and a vast\nrural hinterland. Fertile land is used for residential and industrial expansion.\nOne Kanal (500 sq yard) piece of land in Islamabad sells for PRs20 million\n(approximately $333,333). The price of oil also rises and falls steeply.

Our industries use about 525 types of chemicals and dyes/\ncolors  in  different  processing  industries. Their  processing  generates  wastes\n[that]...contaminat[e]...soil[,]...pose  [a]  potential  risk  to  public  health  and\ndamage the fertility of cropland.\u201d The industrial units set up on agricultural\nland  release  toxic  effluents  that  have  wasted  huge  parcels  of  land.  Kasur,\nFaisalabad, and Sialkot are a few examples. The demographic imbalance, poor\nsanitation, and inadequate resources also exert pressure on the facilities. The\npower supply is overburdened. Worn-down water and sanitation pipes pose\nhealth hazards as well.\n\nResource distribution is uneven between cities. Lahore has a population\nof about 7.5 million but only 6,500 sanitary workers. Delhi, on the other\nhand, has 46,000 sanitary workers to serve its population of 11 million (The\nDaily Nawa-i-Waqt, 22 August 2005). Eighty-four percent of Lahore\u2019s budget\nis for nondevelopment uses.\n\nPoor Governance\n\nThe district coordinating officer of Lahore said in 2005 that only PRs1\nbillion ($16.66 million) out of the PRs6.2 billion ($103.3 million) district\nbudget is available for development. Of the total budget, the district government\nraised only PRs500 million ($8.3 million); PRs5.7 billion ($95 million) came\nfrom the provincial government.\n\nAround 10,000 motor vehicles on average are registered every month\nowing to the ease of leasing (Dawn, 23 August 2005). Parking is a serious\nproblem. The  vehicles  also  produce  air  and  noise  pollution  beyond  the\nprescribed  levels.  Because  of  over  consumption  and  underproduction  of\nelectricity, supply disruptions many times a day cause great inconvenience to\nhouseholds and industrial consumers. Even on the eve of Independence Day\n(14 August) lights went off almost 1,500 times in the Lahore metropolis (The\nNews, 16 August 2005). The proliferation of squatters, katchi abadis (clusters\nof makeshift dwellings), and gypsy towns, and even the sprawling upmarket\nsectors  all  overburden  the  system. The  imbalance  creates  social  disarray\u2014\nbehavioral problems, intolerance, ethnic friction, unemployment, breakdowns\nin law and order, and traffic snarls\u2014and environmental degradation.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 4.pmd\n\n560\n\n20/11/2006, 3:20 PM\n\n\fConstraints and Challenges Arising from Demographic Transitions and Imbalances in Pakistan\n\n561\n\nLack of Potable Water\n\nWater is the universal lifeline. Of the water used worldwide, 70% goes\nto agriculture, 20% to industry, and only 6% to households. Potable water is\navailable to only 25.61% of the people in the urban areas of Pakistan and to\nonly  23.5%  of  those  in  the  rural  areas.  In  the  provision  of  potable  water,\nPakistan ranks 80th out of 122 countries (UNDP 2005). The countries of the\nworld  resolved  in  2000  to  provide  potable  water  to  at  least  half  of  their\npopulation by 2015. According to the director general of the Environmental\nProtection Agency, which is in charge of the Clean Drinking Water Initiative\n(CDWI) in Pakistan, it will take 5 years to install water purification plants all\nover the country (The Daily News, 11 September 2005). Government plans\nto set up those plants with a budget of PRs10 billion ($166.66). The problem\nis that most of the population, and especially the at-risk population, would\nstill not have access to drinking water because the areas where these people\nlive are not covered by water purification plants. Clean water is hard to come\nby. Despite government efforts to provide clean water to every citizen, cases of\nwater contamination occur from time to time and even the federal capital is\nnot exempt.\n\nThe population of [the] metropolis has crossed 800,000 and at present\nneeds 100 million gallons of water daily [to meet] the civil and industrial\nneeds of the...city but the supply of this essential source of life is limited to\n65 million gallons per day. During the dry [season] the administration has\nto [ration] the water. The people resort to the tapping of [subsoil] resources\nand [the water table] further recedes. With the construction boom, the\ncorporate sector needs more water. (The Daily News, 8 September 2005)\nGovernment plans to provide safe drinking water by 2007 under the\ngrand program Water for All costing PRs6.5 billion. But not more than\n30%  of  the  country\u2019s  population  would  get  purified  water  under  that\nscheme. (Dawn, 25 August 2005)\n\nHealth\n\nAccess to medical help is a basic right, and governments are responsible\nfor providing medical care. Pakistan devotes less than 1% of gross national\nproduct (GNP) to health. It ranks 135th among 177 countries in health service\nprovision according to the Human Development Report (UNDP 2005). Most\npeople in the rural areas have no access to health services. Whatever help they\nget in this regard is likely to be substandard or provided by charlatans. Even\nvillages near the federal and provincial capitals do not get health services or\nclean water. The basic health units (BHUs) set up in the villages each have an\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 4.pmd\n\n561\n\n20/11/2006, 3:20 PM\n\n\f562\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nofficially appointed doctor but, most of the time, the doctor is not around to\nhelp, so the support staff attends to the patients. The doctor does not deserve\nall the blame either. BHUs are hard to reach and are not properly equipped\nwith medicines, clean water, and other facilities. To get the care they need, the\npatients travel to the city.\n\nThe  doctor-patient  ratio  reflects  the  level  of  development  of  health\nservices,  and  the  country  in  general.  In  Pakistan,  as  Governor  Khalil-Ur-\nRehman of North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) observed, one doctor serves\nnearly 2,000 patients, compared with the international standard of one doctor\nfor every 500 patients. The doctor-population ratio in NWFP is 1:5,146; in\nthe rest of the country, it is 1:1,773. There is one hospital bed for every 1,703\npersons in NWFP, and one bed for every 1,514 persons elsewhere in the country\n(Islamabad,  Planning  Commission,  Government  of  Pakistan:  Pakistan\nEconomic Survey 2004\u20132005, page 148).\n\nEducation\n\nAccording to the Pakistan Economic Survey of 2004\u20132005, the official\nliteracy rate in 2003\u20132004 was 53%. Pakistan plans to increase investment in\neducation to 4% of GDP within the next 5 years (The Daily Nawa-i-Waqt, 8\nOctober  2005). The  Education  for  All  Global  Monitoring  Report  2005\nestimated the size of the literate population at less than 40% and those with at\nleast a college degree at 4%. Although the Government claims that it spends\nbillions of rupees for education, none of the 5,500 villages in Punjab province\nhave even one school, the report on an education management and information\nsystem survey said. Literacy in most parts of southern Punjab, like Mailis, Pak\nPatan, Pirwala, Ouch Sharif, and Ahmad Pur East is only around 12% (The\nDaily News, 2 September 2005).\n\nThe Government spent about 2.7% of GDP on education in 1999. In\n2005, it spent only 1.8%. Five million children of school age are not in school\n(The Daily Nawa-i-Waqt, 15 September 2005).\n\nGovernment  schools  cannot  accommodate  all  applicants.  Hence,  the\nchildren of the poor, if they can be spared their economic tasks, go instead to\nneighborhood institutions. But there they have to spend for books, uniforms,\nand other essentials. Passing a few classes leads nowhere. The private schools\ngive good-quality education but are too costly.\n\nOpportunities\n\nDemographic imbalances can occur with over- or under-population. In\nsome instances, the demographic imbalance is quite visible but is ignored and\noverlooked  for  reasons  known  only  to  the  policy  makers,  whose  priorities\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 4.pmd\n\n562\n\n20/11/2006, 3:20 PM\n\n\fConstraints and Challenges Arising from Demographic Transitions and Imbalances in Pakistan\n\n563\n\nhave yet to be defined. Some areas are overdeveloped, while others in the same\ncity are underdeveloped. The Government has promised to provide potable\nwater and electricity for all by 2007 (The Daily News, 30 August 2005). The\nPunjab government plans to change the rusted water pipes (mainly in posh\nareas)  to  avoid  sewage  contamination.  To  settle  the  problem  of  power\ndisruptions  in  Lahore,  1,500  transformers  will  be  installed  to  relieve  the\noverloaded system. The social welfare department, for its part, is helping the\npoor. The Child Protection and Welfare Bureau in Punjab rescues and cares\nfor  poor  and  abandoned  children  in  the  province  and  attends  to  their\nrehabilitation. The Institute of Pakistan Bait-ul-Mall has a budget of PRs5\nbillion ($83.3 million), which it uses to help people. Efforts have also been\nmade to eradicate child labor through training and the provision of financial\nincentives to children.\n\nThe demographic changes, especially upward mobility, have some positive\nelements as well. Migrants to the cities provide skilled and unskilled labor.\nFemales make good household help. To meet the rising cost of living, these\npeople often take up two or three jobs. A parallel economy thus exists. After\narriving in the city, the migrants become better aware of education, health,\nand hygiene needs. Vaccinations are done properly. Birth certificates, needed\nfor school registration, help in keeping data on the migrants. The new entrants\ninto the cities and the communities they join can learn from each other.\n\nConclusions and Suggestions\n\nThe demography of big cities is continuously changing. Migrants from\nthe countryside work as porters, street vendors, taxi drivers, and day laborers,\nand often live in shantytowns on the outskirts of the cities. The cities, especially\ntheir more upscale areas, are encroaching on agricultural lands.\n\nProportional urbanization is needed for balanced regional growth. Six\npercent  of  the  population  of  Pakistan  is  urban  and  22%  of  this  urban\npopulation  lives  in  Karachi\u2019s  more  than  500  towns  and  cities. The  United\nNations,  in  its  annual  report  (2005),  has  recommended  that  developing\ncountries set aside at least 20% of their budget for basic health and social\nservices for the poorest sectors of the population. To resolve the inequality\nbetween the urban and rural sectors, Pakistan must provide social and physical\ninfrastructure with no political bias.\n\nWater supply and health services are basic rights of the citizens and not\na privilege. If the rights are not given, those deprived may take them by force.\nAwareness of basic rights and needs is growing as communication systems\ndevelop. With the cities spreading outward, urban and rural areas must join\nhands  in  a  relationship  based  on  equality,  social  justice,  and  harmonious\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 4.pmd\n\n563\n\n20/11/2006, 3:20 PM\n\n\f564\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\ninterdependence.

Instead, everything has\nbeen shamelessly politicized, and democratically elected governments have\nfailed to perform the very basic functions of a polity\u2014ensuring law and order,\nestablishing  justice,  and  collecting  revenue  from  the  citizens\u2014leaving  the\npeople bewildered and disenchanted. Bangladesh may have achieved electoral\ndemocracy through free, fair, and participatory elections but its ambition to\nbecome a liberal democracy is still a distant dream.\n\nAlthough Bangladesh has achieved remarkable socioeconomic progress,\nlaw and order continues to deteriorate and rampant corruption persists. A\nrecent study ranked Bangladesh 17th among 60 weak and failing states that\nare vulnerable to violent internal conflict (Foreign Policy 2005, page 56). The\nranking is based on research methods and findings that are deemed suspect in\nmany quarters, but Bangladesh has undeniably underperformed as a nascent\ndemocracy.  Several  key  factors,  such  as  economic  underdevelopment,  a\ncheckered political history, and weak political institutions, partly explain the\nfailings. This paper, however, looks at the influence of culture on Bangladesh\nsociety and politics, a subject that has not received much scholarly attention\nand has yet to be examined in a systematic manner.\n\nThis paper depicts the cultural landscape of Bangladesh society in the\nlight of cultural theory as propounded by Thompson et al. (1990) and Hofstede\n(1997, 2001), in a bid to comprehend how the dominant culture affects the\nsociety and body politic of Bangladesh. What is the cultural configuration of\nBangladesh society? What is the dominant way of life as posited by Thompson?\nWhere does Bangladesh stand with respect to Hofstede\u2019s four national cultural\ndimensions?  How  do  the  broad  cultural  attributes  of  Bangladesh  society\ninfluence and shape political institutions and the behavior of politicians and\nother major groups? All these questions are addressed in this paper.

Culture  is  about  how\norganizations work, or groups behave, not just how an individual thinks or\nfeels. The theory explains how people in a society derive a limited range of\nanswers to basic social questions such as: How does the world work? What are\nhumans really like? To whom are we accountable? (Wildavsky 1987, page 6).\nGrid-group theorists argue that people\u2019s answers to these questions produce\norientations toward two basic dimensions of sociality (Christensen and Peters\n1999, page 138):\n\n(cid:127) Group: the extent to which people in a society believe that they belong\n\nto particular social groups.\n\n(cid:127) Grid:  people\u2019s  perception  of  the  appropriate  extent  and  variety  of\nrules in a society\u2014in other words, do people believe that social behavior\nshould be determined largely by rules (informal or formal) or is there\nmore leeway for them to determine which behavior is appropriate?\n\nFigure 1: Four Ways of Life\n\nHigh (Group)\nHigh (Group)\nHigh (Group)\nHigh (Group)\nHigh (Group)\n\n)\nd\ni\nr\n\nG\n\n(\n \nh\ng\ni\nH\n\nHierarchical\nHierarchical\nHierarchical\nHierarchical\nHierarchical\n(Collectivism)\n\nFatalistic\nFatalistic\nFatalistic\nFatalistic\nFatalistic\n(Apathy)\n\nEgalitarian\nEgalitarian\nEgalitarian\nEgalitarian\nEgalitarian\n     (Equality)\n\nIndividualistic\nIndividualistic\nIndividualistic\nIndividualistic\nIndividualistic\n(Competition)\n\nL\no\nw\n\n \n(\n\nG\n\nr\ni\nd\n)\n\nLow (Group)\nLow (Group)\nLow (Group)\nLow (Group)\nLow (Group)\n\nSource: Thompson, Ellis, and Wildavsky(1990).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n570\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\fProblems of Democratic Consolidation in Bangladesh: A Cultural Explanation\n\n571\n\nThe answers to these two crucial questions\u2014who we are (group) and\nwhat are we to do (grid)\u2014have profound consequences for the major decisions\nthat people make (Wildavsky, cited in Grendstad 1995, page 101). In any\nsociety, these two dimensions can vary from low to high, thereby resulting in\nfour main ways of life (Figure 1):\n\n(cid:127) Hierarchical (high grid, high group): strong group membership with\nstrong systematic prescriptions. For hierarchists, stratification is an\ninescapable part of social organization (Coughlin and Lockhart 1998,\npage 41). Order is the ultimate goal, and it is sustained and upheld\nthrough wide application of rules and regulations (Lockhart 1999,\npage 868).\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127) Egalitarian (low grid, high group): strong group membership and\nfew systematic prescriptions. The absence of effective and enforceable\nsocietal rules, in turn, appears to require consensual decision making\nwithin the group (Christensen and Peters 1999, page 139).\nIndividualistic  (low  grid,  low  group):  weak  systematic  constraints\nand no binding group membership. Individualists view humans as\nself-interested and broad in capacities (Couhglin and Lockhart 1998,\npage 38). Individualists therefore appear to correspond to the familiar\nmodel of economic man as utility maximizers relatively unconstrained\nby  collective  rules  and  norms  (Christensen  and  Peters  1999,  page\n138).\nFatalistic (high grid, low group): strong systematic prescriptions and\nno group membership. Fatalists have little control over their own life\n(Christensen and Peters 1999, page 139). Fatalism is a passive way of\nlife and experience of involuntary exclusion (Jensen 1998, page 123).\n\n(cid:127)\n\nIn  any  society,  all  ways  of  life  may  coexist  in  a  dynamic  pattern  of\nattraction and separation, particularly at the individual level (Thompson 1996,\npage 9). No way of life entirely dominates an individual\u2019s everyday life and\nidea  of  himself  or  herself  and  the  world.  However,  most  individuals  find\nthemselves living one way more than others (Thompson, Ellis, and Wildavsky\n1990, page 267). The same is not the case with a society or a country. The\nway of life of people (values, norms, and culture) in a society or country is\nmuch  more  stable  and  enduring.  Switching  from  one  way  of  social  life  to\nanother produces not only a different way of looking at the world but also\ndifferent individual and social skills (Jensen 1998, pages 137\u2013138). People\naccustomed  to  a  hierarchical  way  of  life  cannot  easily  do  away  with  their\nsocial convictions and values and switch to an individualistic way of life. So\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n571\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\f572\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nmost people in a society live one way of life, and the way of life they choose\nshapes the lives of other people in that particular society.\n\nNow let us have a look at another prominent cultural theory\u2014this time\nfrom Hofstede (1997, 2001)\u2014which is more empirical in trying to gauge the\ninfluence of culture on institutions and institutional actors.\n\nHofstede\u2019s Four Dimensions of Culture\n\nHofstede\u2019s investigations into the work-related attitudes and values of\nmanagers working for IBM in more than 50 countries and three regions led\nto an impressive analysis of the cultural variations between nationalities (Tayeb\n1988, pages 38\u201339; Handy 1993). He ended up with four cultural dimensions:\n\n(cid:127) Power distance: Conceptually related to the concentration of authority\n(centralization), it indicates the extent to which a society accepts that\npower in institutions and organizations is distributed unequally. In\nsome  national  and  regional  cultures,  huge  inequality  of  power  is\nconcentrated in the hands of a small and permanent elite, organizations\nare  centralized  with  tall  hierarchical  pyramids,  and  upward\ncommunication is restricted. Other cultures have much less inequality,\nmore social mobility, less concentration of power in the hands of a\nfew, decentralized organizations with flatter hierarchies, and relatively\nfree upward communication.\n\n(cid:127) Uncertainty  avoidance:  Related  to  the  structuring  of  activities\n(formalization, specialization, and standardization), it indicates the\nlack  of  tolerance  in  a  society  for  uncertainty  and  ambiguity. This\nexpresses itself in higher levels of anxiety and energy, greater need for\nformal rules and absolute truth, and less tolerance for people or groups\nwith deviant ideas or behaviors. Activity and personal energy levels\nare higher in some cultures. Organizations in more active cultures\ntend to be more specialized, formalized, and standardized. They put\nmore value on uniformity and are less tolerant of deviant ideas. They\ntend to avoid risky decisions. Less active cultures attach less importance\nto formal rules and specialization, are not interested in uniformity,\nand are able to tolerate a large variety of different ideas. They take\nrisks more easily in personal decisions.\nIndividualism/Collectivism:  Individualism  refers  to  a  loosely  knit\nsocial framework in which people take care only of themselves and\ntheir immediate families. Collectivists, on the other hand, can expect\ntheir relatives, clan, or work organization to look after them. Members\nof more collectivist societies have greater emotional dependence on\n\n(cid:127)\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n572\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\fProblems of Democratic Consolidation in Bangladesh: A Cultural Explanation\n\n573\n\ntheir organizations. In a society in equilibrium, the organizations in\nturn assume broad responsibility for their members.\n\n(cid:127) Masculinity/Femininity: The predominant pattern of socialization\nin almost all societies is for men to be more assertive and women to\nbe more nurturing. Data on the importance of work goals show men\ngenerally emphasizing the importance of advancement and earnings,\nand women putting a higher value on quality of life and people. With\nrespect to work goals, some societies are nearer to the masculinity\nend of the masculinity/femininity dimension, while others are nearer\nthe femininity end.\n\nIf these pioneering works of Thompson and Hofstede were juxtaposed,\nsome  sort  of  congruence  would  emerge. The  high  group  represents  the\ncollectivist end of the scale, and the high grid stands for \u201ca system of shared\nclassifications\u201d and greater uncertainty avoidance (Hofstede 1997, page 325).\nA society with high power distance and uncertainty avoidance, collectivity,\nand masculinity may resemble a hierarchic one. Where the opposite dimensions\nof  societal  configuration  hold  true  (low  power  distance  and  uncertainty\navoidance, individuality, and femininity), the society is close to individualistic.\nA society where masculinity and collectivity are dominant dimensions and\nthere is high power distance and uncertainty avoidance is like Thompson\u2019s\nfatalistic  society.  In  an  egalitarian  society  the  dominant  dimensions  are\ncollectivity and femininity, and power distance and uncertainty avoidance are\nboth low.\n\nCultural Landscape of Bangladesh\n\nAlthough  religiously,  ethnically,  and  linguistically  homogeneous,\nBangladesh appears to have a predominantly hierarchical society with high\ngroup and grid values (Kochanek 1993, Bertocci 1996, Hussain and Khan\n1998). Individuals identify strongly with groups, which help in organizing a\ngreat deal of daily life. The following is an attempt to figure out the dominant\nculture of Bangladesh in the light of the theories discussed above, and the\nconsequences for Bangladesh society and body politic.\n\nThe social dimension (grid) of Bangladesh society is heavily influenced\nand shaped by the Hindu religious culture with its caste system and other\nceremonials, as well as the colonial heritage based principally on master-slave\n(unequal) relations. Social stratification and its manifestations in organizations,\nbased on elaborate rules and hierarchy, distance the elite from the common\nmasses. On the other hand, Islam, the major religion in the country, advocates\negalitarian values, brotherhood, and fraternity (group values), and has thus\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n573\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\f574\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\ngained  wider  appeal  and  acceptance  among  the  masses  regardless  of  their\nreligious affiliation.\n\nBangladesh  society  is  collective,  but  collective  norms  are  confined  to\ngroups. It is also predominantly masculine. Uncertainty avoidance is high, as\ncan be seen from the low level of trust placed in people outside the immediate\nfamily. Low trust also promotes factionalism and consolidates hierarchy and\nformal rules in organizations including political parties (Kochanek 1993, Jamil\n1998).\n\nIn Bangladeshi organizations like the family, there is a high degree of\npower distance. Subordinates feel comfortable working under superiors rather\nthan with equals. Superiors confer protection, patronage, and favor in exchange\nfor respect, loyalty, and compliance from their subordinates. Deviant behavior\nand ideas are less encouraged. Opposing a superior\u2019s decisions or raising a\nquestion  is  often  considered  beyadobi  (ill-mannered).  Proper  manners\u2014\nobedience and deference\u2014gain access to patronage and favor. The essence of\nloyalty is order (Jamil 1998, page 148).\n\nAccording to Hofstede\u2019s cross-cultural study (2001), Bangladeshi society\n\nis predominantly hierarchical, as shown in the following table.\n\nCultural Features of Bangladesh Society according to Hofstede (2001)\n\nCultural Dimension\n\nBangladesh\n\nHighest\n\nPower distance\nIndividualism\nMasculinity/Femininity\nUncertainty avoidance\n\n80\n20\n55\n60\n\n104\n 91\n 95\n112\n\nSource: Compiled by the author from Hofstede (2001, page 502).\n\nIndex\n\nLowest\n\n11\n6\n5\n8\n\nMean\n\n58\n48\n50\n60\n\nIn short, according to Hofstede\u2019s features of national culture, Bangladesh\ntends to be a collective, somewhat masculine society with high power distance\nand uncertainty avoidance, resembling the hierarchic one posited by Thompson\n(Thompson, Ellis, and Wildavsky 1990).\n\nHierarchism in Bangladesh: Consequences for Society and Politics\n\nPatron-Client Relations\n\nPeople  who  control  the  mode  of  production,  resource  accumulation,\nand resource distribution are the patrons and the rest are clients. Those of\nhigher rank have the right to extract labor, services, and deference from people\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n574\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\fProblems of Democratic Consolidation in Bangladesh: A Cultural Explanation\n\n575\n\nof lower rank who, in turn, can expect material and other forms of support\nfrom  their  patrons.  Thus,  the  system  is  hierarchically  structured  in  a\ncomplicated maze of mutual obligations (Kochanek 1993, page 44), which\ntend  to  work  at  the  caprice  of  the  patron,  perpetuating  inequality  and\ncorruption.\n\nGroupism/Factionalism\n\nAlthough Bangladesh is not driven by major socioeconomic divisions,\nindividual and group interests often conflict. Someone whose interests are\nbelieved  to  be  threatened  by  others  will  immediately  try  to  blacken  their\nreputation and to approach a group or form one to further his or her interests.\nRivalry and vulgar infighting are common in all walks of life (Siddqui\n1996, page 20). This factionalism may be attributed to the uneven race for\nscarce resources among numerous contenders, who are averse to following the\nrules of the game, as well as the tendency of the contending parties to take\nadvantage of their political ties.\n\nIn politics, party defections and factionalism are widespread. Of the 318\nmembers of parliament (MPs) in the 7th Jatiya Sangsad (JS), 200 (65%) had\nstayed with the same party throughout their political life, while most of the\nrest had changed political affiliation at least once (Rashid 1997). Likewise, all\npolitical parties in Bangladesh are plagued by chronic factionalism. Apart from\nthese explicit factions, there are also covert factions and conflicts within major\nparties.\n\nNepotism/Favoritism\n\nCorruption in the form of nepotism, favoritism, and bribery has become\ninstitutionalized in Bangladesh. It is so rampant; in fact, the country has led\nTransparency  International\u2019s  list  of  corrupt  countries  for  the  last  4  years\n(TI 2005). Small groups share the fruits of corruption among themselves at\nthe cost of national progress. Even the social value system, which once looked\ndown on corrupt persons, is crumbling as honesty is increasingly deemed a\nliability.\n\nTadbir2 is widely practiced. Officials are approached for favors directly\nor through relatives, on the conviction that even the simplest thing will not\nmove by itself. Tadbir is seen as a useful lubricant in overcoming bureaucratic\nobstacles and getting things done faster. One who refuses to entertain tadbir\n\n2 Tadbir  is  a  Bengali  word  that  denotes  the  practice  of  achieving  one\u2019s  purpose  by  capitalizing  on\nkinship  or  friendship  and  offering  gifts,  money,  or  other  inducements  to  a  person  of  power  and\nauthority. It is a form of corruption.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n575\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\f576\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\ninvites criticism from friends and relatives. Closely related to tadbir is political\ninterference in the posting and transfer of civil servants (Siddqui 1996, pages\n26\u201327, 90).\n\nLack of Trust\n\nPeople are generally skeptical of the motives of politicians and do not\nbelieve they are in politics for the benefit of the country. They are disappointed\nand bewildered by the performance of MPs in lawmaking and government\noversight. Parliament often suffers from lack of quorum. Forbidden to criticize\nthe government and express grievances, the main opposition party has taken\nto calling for hartal3 and boycotting parliamentary sessions, sometimes for\nmonths.\n\nPeople show relatively more trust in the nonpartisan caretaker government\nheaded by a retired chief justice of the Supreme Court in Bangladesh, which\nis constitutionally mandated to hold power 3 months before each parliamentary\nelection  and  to  hand  over  power  to  the  new  government.  Incumbent\ngovernments are not trusted to hold free and fair elections. They have also\nbeen sharply criticized by the main opposition for appointing people of their\nchoice to the Supreme Court and the Election Commission with the intention\nof influencing the results of elections.\n\nAlthough the legal system in Bangladesh (especially the lower courts) is\nnot free from political interference, people have relatively high trust in the\nhigher courts. Even political issues that are supposed to be resolved by the\nParliament, as in the \u201cfloor crossing\u201d of two opposition MPs in the 7th JS\n(1996\u20132001),4 are often referred to the Supreme Court for final decision.\n\nLack of Compromise and Consensus\n\nCompromise is rare in Bangladesh politics. The ruling party looks with\nsuspicion at the opposition party and their relationship is marked by much\nanimosity and conflict. Their leaders have not been on speaking terms since\nthe  restoration  of  democratic  governance  in  1991.  Opposition  views  and\ngrievances are treated as a threat to government stability and are unwelcome\n\n3 Hartal refers to shop closures and work stoppages, which bring public life to a standstill.\n4 Two MPs in the 7th JS from the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) became junior\nministers  in  the  government  cabinet  against  their  party\u2019s  directives.  Article  70  of  the  Constitution\nprovides that if an MP resigns or votes against the party that nominated him or her in the election, that\nseat is declared vacant. In this case, the Speaker declared that the MPs had neither voted against nor\nresigned from their party, and refused to refer the dispute to the Election Commission. The BNP took\nthe issue to the High Court, which declared that the two MPs had acted ultra vires. Later, the Election\nCommission declared the two seats vacant on account of floor crossing.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n576\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\fProblems of Democratic Consolidation in Bangladesh: A Cultural Explanation\n\n577\n\nin the plenary sessions. It is not uncommon to have the Speaker switch off the\nmicrophone of the leader of the opposition, and therefore, neither are walkouts,\nboycotts, and street protests (Ahmed 1995, page 394; Ahmed 1997, page 90).\nIn fact, the history of opposition political parties in Bangladesh is a history\nof oppression and intimidation by the incumbent government, and police\nharassment. Laws and the judicial process have been muzzled in countless\ninstances to humiliate political opponents, who are tempted with powerful\npositions and financial offers; and if those soft approaches fail, they are finally\nsilenced with stiff measures. The forms of coercion include threats to life from\nmastans5 and corruption charges filed by the ruling government against the\nfrontline opposition leaders. The opposition, as a result, opposes all proposals\nby the ruling party, irrespective of content or utility.\n\nIn the absence of compromise between the contending parties, hartal\ncalled by the main opposition parties took up 173 days in 1995\u20131996, and\n100 days from 1996\u20132003, causing great distress to the economy and the\ndaily  lives  of  Bangladeshis.  According  to  a  press  statement  from  a  former\nfinance minister, a single day\u2019s hartal costs the economy an estimated Tk3,860\nmillion  ($67  million)  (The  Daily  Star,  29 September  2003). The  lack  of\nconsensus and compromise between the ruling and opposition political parties\nhas also made rubber-stamp parliaments of the 5th, 7th, and 8th JSs, despite\ntheir  having  come  into  being  in  free  and  fair  elections,  and  provoked  the\nmajor opposition parties into boycotting and hartal.\n\nFatalistic Attitude\n\nMost Bangladeshis perceive time as a linear dimension,6 reflecting their\nfatalistic attitude toward life. They live on relaxed time\u2014attendance at crucial\nmeetings is often deliberately delayed, even by those in responsible positions\u2014\nand,  while  prompt  in  making  commitments,  are  careless  in  keeping  those\ncommitments. Their fatalism is driven not only by religious belief in Takdir\nor Vhagga  (unseen  destiny  regulated  by  Allah)  but  also  by  the  cruelties  of\nnature  and  unjust  governance,  which  Bangladesh  is\u2014especially  the  less\naffluent\u2014feel powerless to stop.\n\n5 Mastans are terrorists living outside the law of the land on toll collections and with the protection of\n\ninfluential patrons.\n\n6 They live in awe of the day of judgment and believe that the future is in the hands of an absolute\nGod, not of mere mortals (Hayashi 1988, pages 25\u201329). Allah (God) is senior and human beings are\njunior.  Hence,  anyone  seeking  an  appointment  with  a  Bangladeshi  will  get  the  standard  answer,\n\u201cInshallah\u201d (If Allah permits).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n577\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\f578\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nCentralized Leadership\n\nEach major political party is headed by a person who is all-powerful in\nits management. The party structure and the central and executive committees\nare filled by nomination and not by election (Ahmed 1995, page 372).\n\nNone of the major parliamentary parties distinguish between the party\nwing and the parliamentary chapter. The leadership of both wings is closely\nlinked in the present ruling party (the Bangladesh Nationalist Party [BNP]).\nKhaleda  Zia,  the  prime  minister,  holds  three  major  positions\u2014aside  from\nbeing prime minister, she heads the BNP Parliamentary Party and is the BNP\nchairperson.  Likewise,  Sheikh  Hasina,  the  former  prime  minister,  is  the\npresident  of  the  Bangladesh  Awami  League  (BAL)  and  the  leader  of  its\nparliamentary party, besides being the current leader of the opposition.\n\nThe top leadership of each party also nominates the members of the\nparliamentary board, which selects candidates for parliamentary election. The\nrole of the constituency is marginal in this regard. In most cases, the central\nleadership imposes its decisions on the local branches of the party. The tendency\nto concentrate all powers in the center keeps the backbenchers at bay and\nmakes them subservient to the whims of the central leadership (Ahmed 1998,\npages 88\u201389). To be nominated for the parliamentary election, it is not enough\nto be loyal to the party and to have political experience and commitment.\nOne  must  also  have  wealth,  influence,  and  the  blessings  of  the  central\nleadership. After election, MPs are bound to find their autonomy seriously\nconstrained  by  party  directives  and  the  party  chief.  Loyalty  to  the  party\nleadership becomes the ticket to progress in their political career. Leaders need\nand  demand  reassurance  from  admiring  followers. The  followers,  in  turn,\ndepend on the security of an understanding guru (preceptor) or an idealized\nbrotherhood (Pye 1985, page 157). Intra-party dissent is well-nigh prohibited.\nThe decision of the party chief is usually final and irreversible. The suppression\nof dissent among party workers is a major cause of factionalism and defection.\n\nRelaxed Accountability for Superiors\n\nThe notion of accountability in Bangladesh is set within an ambiguous\nand bewildering cultural framework. Patron-client relations profoundly affect\naccountability mechanisms. The relationship between father and child, teacher\nand student, senior official and subordinate, husband and wife, housewife\nand maidservant, landlord and tenant, rich farmer and marginal peasant, the\neducated and the uneducated, the ruling party and the opposition party, the\nprime minister and the leader of the opposition\u2014all these are based on the\nkey concept of boro-choto (superior-inferior). There is still no viable mechanism\nfor ensuring the accountability of the senior or stronger group or patron, and\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n578\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\fProblems of Democratic Consolidation in Bangladesh: A Cultural Explanation\n\n579\n\nhence no effective sanction for the group. This uneven treatment is prevalent\nand accepted by the whole society.\n\nA minister holds a high rank and status in the social hierarchy as part of\nthe elite strata, usually from a reputable and affluent family and with long\nexperience in politics and a highly developed network. A minister is likely to\nhave access to all persons and institutions. Government backbenchers who\nmake up the majority membership of parliamentary committees (entrusted\nwith oversight of the executive) may therefore find it a career risk to call a\nminister from the executive branch to account. The minister is viewed as a\nfather  figure  and  any  serious  attempt  by  government  backbenchers  to\ninterrogate the minister vigorously in committee sessions may be taken as an\novert act of disrespect.\n\nNow we will have a look at the comparative competence of MPs and the\nbureaucracy  to  determine  who  is  superior  to  whom  and  in  what  respect.\nAppendix  1  summarizes  the  background\u2014education,  occupation,  and\nparliamentary  experience\u2014of  MPs.  In  the  5th  JS,  38%  of  the  MPs  had\npostgraduate degrees and 46% had graduate degrees. In the 7th JS, 40% of\nthe MPs had postgraduate degrees while 45% had graduate degrees. Most\nMPs have a general educational background rather than specialized background\nin law, politics, or administration (Rashid 1997).\n\nBusinessperson MPs were the largest elite group in the 5th (59%) and\n7th (48%) JSs, while somewhat smaller in the 8th. A considerable proportion\nof the MPs who entered the parliaments in the 1990s (68% in the 5th, 40%\nin the 7th, and 33% in the 8th JS) were new and inexperienced in parliamentary\nprocedures, let alone the specialized committee assignments. They were not\ntrained in legislative and administrative affairs. Even the committee members\nin the 8th JS, with their parliamentary experience from earlier JSs, had seen\nonly the operations of committees in the 5th and 7th JSs. Now, to compare\nthe  competence  of  MPs  with  bureaucrats,  let  us  have  a  look  inside  the\nbureaucracy.\n\nMost  of  the  permanent  secretaries  in  charge  of  ministries  are  well\neducated, and some hold higher degrees from universities overseas. They have\nundergone intensive probationary and in-service training since their entrance\ninto  the  civil  service  and  have  vast  experience  (32  years  or  more)  in\nadministration  under  diverse  civil  and  military  regimes.  Bureaucracy  is\nessentially domination through information. A bureaucracy becomes more\nautonomous to the extent that its decisions are shielded from outside influence,\ni.e., from politicians, academics, voluntary organizations, citizens, and the like\n(Olsen 1983). According to a survey by Jamil (1998, page 108), bureaucratic\ndecisions  in  Bangladesh  are  derived  mostly  from  internal  sources,  such  as\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n579\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\f580\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nsuperiors, colleagues, juniors, official circulars, and gazettes, rather than from\nexternal sources. This shows the bureaucrats\u2019 stranglehold on information.\n\nIt  is  evident  from  the  comparison  between  the  bureaucracy  and  the\nParliament that the bureaucrats have an advantage over the MPs in having a\nstable career; expertise and collective knowledge borne of formal education,\nintensive  training,  and  professional  experience;  monopoly  on  practical\ninformation; numerical strength; and material resources accumulation (Olsen\n1983, page 143; Rosen 1998, page 79). Moreover, the bureaucracy still seems\nto be more institutionalized than the Parliament, as explained in Rahman\n(2000). Hence, MPs lag behind the bureaucrats in major aspects of competence,\nwhich  hinder  the  committee  members  from  taking  command  of  the\nbureaucracy  and  holding  bureaucrats  accountable  for  their  decisions  and\nactions (Weber, cited in Rosen 1998, page 79).\n\nFrom the standpoint of the prevalent cultural value of bureaucrats and\nMPs in superior-inferior positions, MPs lag behind the bureaucrats in almost\nall respects. Culturally, MPs are supposed to be in a better position to hold the\nbureaucrats accountable. The reality is contrary to the expectation. Enforcing\naccountability solely on the basis of authority and legitimacy gained through\nelection is a formidable task for the committee members. The cultural value\nof having no viable mechanism for ensuring the accountability of the senior\nor stronger group is reflected in the formal arrangement of the committee\nsystem and its real-world implications for ensuring bureaucratic accountability.\nThe institutional rules for running parliamentary committees are devised in a\nway that puts the incumbent government in a convenient position to be the\nfinal arbiter of any accountability issues.\n\nThe cultural value makes the ruling party (government) always superior\nto the opposition parties. Even after 1990, democratically-elected governments\nbrought about changes in the institutional rules of committees with an eye to\ntheir own convenience, and these were not enough to hold the bureaucrats\naccountable. Latent in the halfhearted efforts to overhaul the committee system\nwas  the  cultural  value  of  domination  and  nonaccountability  of  the  ruling\nregime.  Formulating  robust  rules  for  committees  to  hold  the  executive\naccountable  might  compel  the  ruling  elite  to  account  for  their  activities.\nBureaucratic accountability and political accountability are so inexorably linked\nthat  without  political  accountability,  it  is  almost  impossible  for  the\nparliamentary  committees,  composed  of  elected  political  elite,  to  ensure\nbureaucratic accountability. Hence, the cultural values profoundly influenced\nthe ruling regime to devise institutional rules that allowed it to be immune\nfrom accounting for its actions.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n580\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\fProblems of Democratic Consolidation in Bangladesh: A Cultural Explanation\n\n581\n\nEmergence of the Elite as Cartel\n\nA  hierarchical  network  cannot  sustain  social  trust  and  cooperation\n(Putnam 1993, page 174) throughout the society. Consequently, mutual trust\nand symbiotic relations loom in small coteries with no incentive to work for\nthe common well-being of the society and every incentive to indulge in costly\nand inefficient rent seeking and the pursuit of group interests only (Olson,\ncited  in  Putnam  1993,  page  176).  Politicians,  mastans,  loan  defaulters,\nbusinesspersons, parliamentarians, and bureaucrats in Bangladesh belong to a\nsmall elite group whose members serve one another\u2019s interests. There is no\npolar capitalist class in the country that can put the brakes on corruption by\nthe executive.\n\nA considerable percentage (about 9%) of MPs in the 7th JS belonged to\nthe  top  bank-loan  defaulter  coterie  of  the  country  (see  Appendix  2).\nBusinessperson MPs were the largest group of elite in the 5th (59%), and 7th\n(48%) JSs (see Appendix 1). The politicians (MPs) depend on businesspersons\nand mastans for party funds and muscle power to establish hegemony in their\nconstituencies. Many of the top bank-loan defaulting MPs were in 7th JS\ncommittees entrusted with ensuring financial propriety and keeping watchful\neyes  on  the  executive.  For  example,  29  defaulting  MPs  held  46  of  472\ncommittee positions (9.4%) in the 7th JS. Among the loan-defaulting MPs\nholding committee positions, five were cabinet ministers and four were former\nministers, while six (13%) were committee chairpersons in the 7th JS. (See\nAppendix 2.)\n\nThe fact that the standing committee on finance in the 7th JS intervened\nin favor of a defaulter and took the finance minister to task demonstrated the\ninfluence of defaulters on the political system. A survey of defaulted bank\nloans by the Bangladesh Institute of Bank Management (BIBM) revealed that\nin sanctioning the loans ministers (most of them MPs) influenced 46% of the\ncases; MPs, 35%; ruling party leaders, 13%; and collective bargaining agency,\nleaders 4% (The Daily Star, 30 May 2000). Committees have been used to\nelicit official information for private benefit or to put pressure on public officials\nto realize some personal agenda (Sobhan 2000). For many other reasons, the\ncommittee members have become the allies of the bureaucracy.\n\nFor  instance,  MPs  spend  a  great  deal  of  money  (an  average  of Tk70\nmillion in each constituency, according to the present World Bank country\ndirector in Bangladesh) to get themselves elected, and the lion\u2019s share of this\nmoney is provided by the candidates themselves relatives, well-wishers, and\nbusinesspersons.  Once  elected,  they  inevitably  expect  to  recover  the\nexpenditure\u2014often,  many  times  over.  Now  the  MP  must  approach  the\nbureaucrats who run the administration and the banks and are guardians of\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n581\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\f582\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nstate resources. A senior colleague who also happens to be the executive head\nof a ministry can help further the interests of the bureaucrats in the ministry\nthrough  promotions,  transfers,  and  material  gains.  Hence,  the  bureaucrat,\nthe minister, the treasury bench committee member, the businesspersons, and\nthe  mastans  connive  in  corruption  by  making  accountability  mechanisms\nperfunctory. Even former World Bank country director in Bangladesh Frederick\nT. Temple was openly wary about the commercialization and criminalization\nof politics and the adverse effects on Bangladesh society. As partners in the\nsmall coterie, committee members can hardly be expected to arrest corruption\nand ensure executive accountability until this vicious cycle of symbiotic relations\ndeclines or at least weakens.\n\nConclusion\n\nPathologies like factionalism, nepotism, centralization, fatalism, relaxed\naccountability mechanisms for superiors, and elitism are manifestations of\nthe dominant hierarchical culture in Bangladesh. A hierarchical society with\nhigh group values sets great store by values like collectivity, solidarity, fraternity,\nand compromise or consensus, which are present\u2014albeit in a different form\n(also with a strong element of fatalism)\u2014in Bangladesh. Likewise, a hierarchical\nsociety is typified by grid values, where informal rules are stressed and formal\nrules are honored more in the breach than in the observance. In that respect,\nBangladesh  also  falls  short  of  being  a  true  hierarchical  society.  Because\nBangladesh has several features of the fatalistic dimension of sociality, we can\ncall its society a hierarchic-fatalistic one.\n\nThe hierarchical culture has enormous consequences for the functioning\nof the country\u2019s key political institutions as well as the behavior of the major\nactors in the society. Culture does matter a great deal and can explain the\nmany  failings  of  Bangladesh\u2019s  relentless  and  tireless  endeavor  to  establish\ndemocratic governance in Bangladesh.\n\nBangladesh  is  a  densely  populated  society  of  140  million  people  on\n144,000 km2 of land where resources are scarce and dealings between seniors/\nsuperiors  and  juniors/inferiors  are  marked  by  widespread  disparity  and\ndiscrimination,  fostering  intolerance,  enmity,  rivalry,  and  vindictiveness.\nJuniors/inferiors are not left enough room in the social and political sphere to\nbreathe. There is virtually no accommodation of the juniors/opposition and\nno sharing of power. The superior groups/parties, to make up for losing their\npredominant positions, resort to oppressive measures to weaken and destroy\nthe opposition. The junior parties also use all sorts of measures, legal or illegal,\nto force the superiors from their positions and take them over. In Bangladesh,\na  low-trust  society,  the  contending  parties  are  skeptical  of  each  other\u2019s\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n582\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\fProblems of Democratic Consolidation in Bangladesh: A Cultural Explanation\n\n583\n\nintentions, have no respect for each other, and are not used to following the\nrules of the game. The \u201cwinner takes all\u201d attitude of the superiors is reflected\nnot only in their behavior toward the juniors but also in the rules they set for\nall  the  major  institutions  in  the  country,  including  the  electoral  system\n(plurality), the Parliament, the judiciary, the bureaucracy, the armed forces,\nlocal government, media, and even civil society. The rules are heavily biased\nin favor of the powerful/superior parties/groups. Moreover, because of lack of\ntrust  across  the  society,  politicians,  businesspersons,  parliamentarians,  and\ncivil-military bureaucrats have come together in a small coterie with symbiotic\nrelations to serve one another\u2019s interests. No interested party in the country\n(barring the opposition) can hold the brakes on corruption by the executive\nand  call  the  executive  to  account. Thus,  the  country\u2019s  destructive  political\nculture, which is premised on the dominant hierarchical structure and values\nof  the  society,  is  a  serious  threat  to  democracy  and  a  serious  hindrance  to\ndemocratic governance in Bangladesh.\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n583\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\f584\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nReferences\n\nAhmed, M. 1995.

Agarwal1\n\nIntroduction\n\nMahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, wrote in his autobiography\n\n(1962; reprinted 2001, page 258) about the role of the law and lawyers:\n\nI had learnt the true practice of law. I had learnt to find out the better side\nof human nature, and to enter men\u2019s hearts. I realised that the true function\nof a lawyer was to unite parties riven asunder. The lesson was so indelibly\nburnt into me that the large part of my time during the twenty years of my\npractice as a lawyer was occupied in bringing about private compromises\nof hundreds of cases. I lost nothing thereby\u2014not even money, certainly\nnot my soul.\n\nAny conflict is like a cancer. The sooner it is resolved, the better for all\nthe parties concerned in particular, and; society in general. If it is not resolved\nat the earliest possible opportunity, it grows at a very fast pace; and with time,\nthe effort required to resolve it increases exponentially as new issues emerge\nand conflicting situations proliferate. One dispute leads to another. Hence, it\nis essential to resolve the dispute the moment it rears its head. The method of\nachieving this goal must be agreeable to both parties and should achieve the\ngoal  of  resolving  the  dispute  speedily.  This  state  of  uncertainty  and\nindecisiveness should be as brief as possible to avoid psychological, physical,\nand mental losses.\n\nThe Constitution of India has defined and declared the common goal\nfor its citizens as: \u201cto secure to all the citizens of India, justice\u2014social, economic,\nand  political\u2014liberty,  equality,  and  fraternity.\u201d  The  eternal  value  of\nconstitutionalism is the rule of law, which has three facets (i.e., rule by law,\nrule under law, and rule according to law).\n\nHow to secure to all the citizens the justice that the Constitution talks\nabout is a big question faced by the judiciary. Court dockets are overloaded\nand new cases are filed every day. It is becoming humanly impossible for the\n\n1\n\nFaculty, Business Policy Area, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, India.\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n589\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\f590\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nregular courts to decide all these cases in a speedy manner. This is not true in\nIndia alone. This, unfortunately, is the situation in a large number of jurisdictions.\n\nNeed for Alternative Dispute Resolution Methods\n\nWith the evolution of modern states and sophisticated legal mechanisms,\nthe  courts  run  on  very  formal  processes  and  are  presided  over  by  trained\nadjudicators entrusted with the responsibility of resolving disputes on behalf\nof the state. Those who seek justice approach the courts of justice with pain\nand anguish in their hearts, having faced legal problems and having suffered\nphysically or psychologically. They do not take the law into their own hands\nbecause they believe that they will get justice from the courts in the end. It is\nthe obligation of the judiciary to deliver quick and inexpensive justice shorn\nof the complexities of procedure. However, the reality is that it takes a very\nlong time to get justice through the established court system. Obviously, this\nleads  to  a  search  for  an  alternative  mechanism  complementary  and\nsupplementary to the process of the traditional civil court, for inexpensive,\nexpeditious,  and  less  cumbersome\u2014and  also  less  stressful\u2014resolution  of\ndisputes. But the elements of judiciousness, fairness, equality, and compassion\ncannot be sacrificed at the altar of expeditious disposal. It is said that justice\ndelayed is justice denied. But justice has to be imparted: it cannot be hurried\nto be buried. The cases must be decided and not just disposed of. Justice that\nis both speedy and true must be provided. This is easier said than done.\n\nThe Indian judiciary is held in very high esteem in all the developing as\nwell as the developed countries of the world. However, there is criticism that\nthe  Indian  judiciary  is  unable  to  clear  the  backlog  of  cases.  Available  and\nrelevant statistics show that though the pendency of cases is always highlighted,\nthe number of cases filed and disposed of each year is never mentioned. In\n2001\u20132004, on the average, the subordinate courts disposed of 13 million\ncases every year, and the High Courts, 1.5 million cases. The Fast Track Courts\ndisposed of 370,000 cases during the same period. The Supreme Court of\nIndia disposes of about 50,000 cases per year.\n\nThe law courts are confronted with four main problems:\n\n(cid:127) The number of courts and judges in all grades is alarmingly inadequate.\n(cid:127) The  flow  of  cases  has  increased  in  recent  years  because  of  the\nmultifarious acts passed by the central and state governments.\nProsecuting or defending cases in a court of law is very costly because\nof the heavy court fees, lawyers\u2019 fees, and incidental charges.\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127) The disposal of cases is often delayed, resulting in huge pendency in\n\nall the courts.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n590\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\fRole of Alternative Dispute Resolution Methods in the Development of Society: Lok Adalat in India\n\n591\n\nThese problems do not have an instant solution. For each problem, there\nare a number of reasons that need to be tackled; however, tackling those reasons\nrequires much time and willpower on the part of the leaders of the nation.  In\nthe meantime, the country has to move on. Disputes will keep emerging and,\nif not resolved, will keep on piling up, making life difficult for everyone.\n\nIn every kind of civilization\u2014and India is no exception\u2014the pursuit of\njustice is instinctive. It is an individual and societal instinct, which every society\nstrives to satisfy through its legal system. The degree of perfection attained by\na legal system may be measured by the extent to which the justice system is\nable to express itself and to find its fulfillment. Not every legal system meets\nthis  goal.  Sometimes  a  legal  system  fails  to  achieve  its  purpose  because  of\ndefects and deficiencies in its substantive laws, and sometimes the failure is\nmainly due to frailties in its procedural rules. Fortunately, the judicial system\nin India is well organized, with a high level of integrity, and has been able to\ndevelop a system of alternative dispute resolution (ADR).\n\nADR has become a global necessity. In recent times, methods of ADR\nhave emerged as one of the most significant movements in conflict management\nand  judicial  reform. The  entire  legal  fraternity\u2014lawyers,  students,  judges,\nand legislators\u2014all over the world have started viewing dispute resolution in\na new perspective. Many more alternatives to litigation have emerged. ADR is\nnow an integral part of modern legal practice and jurisprudence.\n\nADR Methods\n\nLitigation does not always lead to a satisfactory result. It is expensive in\nterms of time and money. A case won or lost in a court of law does not change\nthe mind-set of the litigants, who continue to be adversaries and file appeal\nafter appeal. ADR systems enable a change in the mental approach of the\nparties. Those who go to court know that they will either win all or lose all.\nBut when they opt for any method of ADR or for informal settlement, they\nknow fully well that they may not get all that they want, but they will not lose\neverything.\n\nThe main methods of ADR are negotiation, mediation, conciliation,\nand arbitration. Conciliation is often held to be a constructive approach to\njusticiable disputes. Though the term \u201cconciliator\u201d is interchangeable with\nthe  term  \u201cmediator,\u201d  there  are  differences  between  these  two  positions.  A\nmediator is usually a person accepted by the disputants themselves, whose\nprincipal task is to bring the parties together so that they can arrive at an\nagreed solution to the dispute. The mediator may see the parties privately,\nlisten to their viewpoint, and impress upon each party an understanding of\nthe viewpoint of the other party.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n591\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\f592\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nLike a mediator, a conciliator also has the primary duty of helping the\nparties to a dispute reach an amicable settlement. On the other hand, the\nconciliator also draws up the terms of the agreement for settlement after having\na detailed discussion with the parties to the dispute. Each party is invited to a\nconciliation conference to place their viewpoints before the conciliator, who\nclarifies complicated issues and takes notes. After the conference, the conciliator\nmay talk to the parties separately and ascertain their \u201cbottom line,\u201d that is,\nthe figure at which each party would be prepared to settle. The conciliator\nthen proposes a solution to the parties.\n\nConciliation and mediation differ from arbitration, as the former two\nmethods do not result in a binding or enforceable settlement without any\nstatutory sanction.\n\nThe Lok Adalat is a fine blend of all these ADR methods.\n\nADR and Lok Adalat in India\n\nADR has long been practiced in India, especially at the grassroots level.\nThe panchayat (village council) is widely used to resolve disputes, commercial\nas well as noncommercial.\n\nThe Lok Adalat (People\u2019s Court), where justice is dispensed without delay\nand without too much emphasis on legal technicalities, is ADR method, most\nsuited to the Indian environment, culture, and societal interests. Its salient\nfeatures are participation, accommodation, fairness, expectation, voluntariness,\nneighborliness, transparency, efficiency, and lack of animosity. The concept\nlost value in the last few centuries before independence and particularly during\nthe British regime, but has since been revived.\n\nLok Adalat camps were started in Gujarat in March 1982 and have now\nbeen extended throughout the country, to relieve the heavy burden on courts\nwith pending cases. They have been very successful in the settlement of motor\naccident  claims,  matrimonial  and  family  disputes,  labor  disputes,  disputes\nrelating to public services, bank recovery cases, and other cases.\n\nUp to the middle of 2004, more than 200,000 Lok Adalat camps had\nbeen held and they had led to the settlement of more than 16 million cases,\nhalf  of  them  involving  motor  accident  claims.  More  than  $1  billion  was\ndistributed to compensate those who had suffered accidents, and 6.7 million\npeople have received legal aid and advice.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n592\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\fRole of Alternative Dispute Resolution Methods in the Development of Society: Lok Adalat in India\n\n593\n\nLok Adalat Benefits\n\nLitigants derive many benefits through the Lok Adalat.\nFirst, there is no court fee, and even if the case has also been filed in a\nregular court, the fee already paid will be refunded if the dispute is settled at\nthe Lok Adalat.\n\nSecond, procedural laws and the Evidence Act are not strictly applied\nwhile the merits of the claim are assessed by the Lok Adalat. The parties to a\ndispute, though represented by their advocate, can deal directly with the Lok\nAdalat judge and explain their stand and the reasons for it. This is not possible\nin a regular court of law.\n\nThird, disputes can immediately be brought before the Lok Adalat without\n\nhaving to go through a regular court first.\n\nFourth, the decision of the Lok Adalat is binding on the parties to the\ndispute and its order is capable of execution through the legal process. No\nappeal can be made against the order of the Lok Adalat, whereas in the regular\nlaw courts there is always scope for appeal to a higher forum, causing delay in\nthe final settlement of the dispute.\n\nThe system has been acclaimed by the parties involved and by public\nand legal functionaries. Besides the advantage of fast settlement, free of cost,\nthe Lok Adalat also promotes the jurisprudence of peace in the larger interest\nof justice and wider sections of society.\n\nLok Adalat Procedure\n\nThe  procedure  followed  at  a  Lok  Adalat  is  very  simple  and  shorn  of\nalmost all legal formality and ritual. A sitting or retired judicial officer presides\nas chairperson, and there are two members, usually a lawyer and a social worker.\nAny one or more of the parties to a dispute can apply to have a case that\nis pending or even at the pre-litigation stage taken up in the Lok Adalat. The\nLok Adalat constituted for the purpose then attempts to resolve the dispute by\nhelping the parties arrive at an amicable solution. Once it succeeds, the decision\nis final and has as much force as a decree of a civil court that is obtained after\ndue contest.\n\nCivil or criminal matters may be brought before a Lok Adalat, but it\ncannot decide on any matter relating to an offense that is not compoundable\nunder any law, even if the parties involved were to agree to settle the case. A\nLok Adalat can take cognizance not only of matters involving persons who are\nentitled  to  free  legal  services  but  also  of  all  other  matters.  One  important\ncondition is that both parties to a dispute should agree to have the dispute\nsettled through the Lok Adalat and abide by its decision.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n593\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\f594\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nExperience has shown that money claims are more easily settled in a Lok\nAdalat since in most such cases the amount alone may be in dispute. Thus, a\nmultitude of motor accident compensation claims have been brought before\nthe Lok Adalat and been disposed of.\n\nLegislation Pertinent to Lok Adalat\n\nThe Lok Adalat was given statutory recognition in 1987, pursuant to the\nconstitutional mandate in article 39A of the Constitution of India. The Legal\nServices Authorities Act, 1987, provides for the constitution of legal services\nauthorities to provide free and competent legal services to the weaker sections\nof the society to ensure that no citizen is denied opportunities to secure justice\nbecause  of  economic  or  other  disabilities,  and  for  the  organization  of  Lok\nAdalats to promote justice on the basis of equal opportunity.\n\nIn  2002,  the  Parliament  of  India  amended  the  act  requiring  the\nestablishment of permanent Lok Adalats for public utility services. \u201cPublic\nutility services,\u201d as defined in the amended act, include transport services for\nthe carriage of passengers or goods by air, road, or water; postal, telegraph, or\ntelephone services; insurance service; services in a hospital or dispensary; supply\nof power, light, or water to the public; and systems of public conservancy or\nsanitation. Any civil dispute with a public utility service, where the value of\nthe property in dispute does not exceed Rs1 million (about $2,200), or any\ncriminal dispute that does not involve an offense not compoundable under\nany law, can be taken up in the Permanent Lok Adalat.\n\nAn important feature of this amendment is that after an application is\nmade to the Permanent Lok Adalat, no party to that application can invoke\nthe jurisdiction of any court in the same dispute. The Permanent Lok Adalat\nattempts  to  settle  such  disputes  involving  public  utility  services  through\nconciliation and, failing that, it decides on the basis of merit. It is guided by\nthe principles of natural justice, objectivity, fair play, equity, and other principles\nof justice without being bound by the Code of Civil Procedure and the Indian\nEvidence Act.\n\nA 2002 amendment to Section 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure has\nalso opened the way for conciliation, mediation, and pretrial settlement. Once\nthe model rules framed by the committee headed by Justice Jagannadha Rao,\nchairperson, Law Commission of India, under the direction of the Supreme\nCourt of India, have been adopted by all the High Courts, funds will need to\nbe  sanctioned  for  the  requisite  infrastructure  and  for  the  employment  of\nmediators and conciliators. The mediators and conciliators must be trained in\nthe art of mediation and conciliation in India. ADR would drastically bring\ndown the pendency of cases by accelerating their disposal. In California, where\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n594\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\fRole of Alternative Dispute Resolution Methods in the Development of Society: Lok Adalat in India\n\n595\n\nsystems of mediation, conciliation, and pretrial settlement were introduced\nonly 2 decades ago, 94% of cases are referred for settlement through ADR\nand 46% of such cases are settled without contest. The result is that California\nhas been able to decide civil cases within less than 2 years from the date of filing.\nThe constitutional validity of the amendments to section 89 of the Code\nof Civil Procedure incorporating ADR methods were upheld by the Supreme\nCourt of India in a recently decided case (Supreme Court 2005b).\n\nSome  of  the  relevant  sections  from  the  Legal  Services  Authority  Act,\n\n1987, are as follows.\n\nSection 19: General Provisions\n\n(cid:127) Central, state, district, and taluk legal services authorities have been\ncreated  to  organize Lok  Adalats.  Taluk  is  also  known  as  \u2018block\u2019.  A\ndistrict is divided into several blocks.\nLok Adalat conciliators comprise the following:\n- A sitting or retired judicial officer,\n- Other persons of repute as may be prescribed by the state government\n\n(cid:127)\n\nin consultation with the chief justice of the High Court.\n\nSection 20: Reference of Cases\n\ncircumstances:\n\nCases can be referred for the consideration of Lok Adalat in the following\n\n(cid:127) Both parties to the dispute give their consent.\n(cid:127) One of the parties applies to have the case referred to the Lok Adalat.\n(cid:127) The  court  is  satisfied  that  the  matter  is  an  appropriate  one  to  be\n\ntaken cognizance of by the Lok Adalat.\n\nCompromise settlement shall be guided by the principles of justice, equity,\n\nfair play, and other legal principles.\n\nWhere no compromise is arrived at through conciliation, the matter is\n\nreturned to the concerned court for disposal according to the law.\n\nSection 21: Award\n\nAfter  the  parties  agree,  the  award  is  decided  by  the  conciliators. The\n\nmatter need not be referred to the concerned court for a consent decree.\n\nThe relevant provisions of the act are as follows:\n(cid:127) Every award of Lok Adalat shall be deemed as a decree of a civil court.\n(cid:127) Every award made by the Lok Adalat shall be final and binding on all\n\nthe parties to the dispute.\n\n(cid:127) The award of the Lok Adalat shall not be subject to appeal.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n595\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\f596\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nEvery  proceedings  of  the  Lok  Adalat  shall  be  deemed  to  be  judicial\n\nSection 22: Status of Proceedings\n\nproceedings for the purpose of:\nSummoning witnesses,\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\nPresenting documents,\n(cid:127) Receiving evidence, and\n(cid:127) Requisitioning public records.\n\nFinality of Lok Adalat Award\n\nOne issue that often arises is the finality of the award of the Lok Adalat.\nDuring the Lok Adalat, the parties agree to abide by the decision of the Lok\nAdalat judge. However, the order is often challenged on several grounds. In a\nrecent decision, the Supreme Court of India stated in unequivocal terms that\nthe award of the Lok Adalat is as good as the decree of a court. Therefore, the\ncourts have all the powers in relation to it as they have in relation to decrees\nthey themselves passed. These powers include the power to extend time in\nappropriate cases. The award passed by the Lok Adalat is taken to be the decision\nof the court itself, though arrived at by the simpler method of conciliation\ninstead of the process of arguments in court (Supreme Court 2005b).\n\nConsent of the Parties\n\nThe most important factor to be considered while deciding cases in the\nLok Adalat is the consent of both parties. However, once the parties agree, the\nmatter has to be decided by the Lok Adalat. Then neither party can walk away\nfrom the decision. In several instances, the Supreme Court has held that without\nthe consent of the parties the award of the Lok Adalat is not executable, and\nalso that if the parties fail to agree to have the dispute resolved through Lok\nAdalat, the regular litigation process remains open to the contesting parties\n(Supreme Court 2004a).\n\nThe  Supreme  Court  has  also  held  that  \u201ccompromise\u201d  implies  some\nelement of accommodation on both sides but cannot be described as \u201ctotal\nsurrender\u201d  (Supreme  Court  2005c).  A  compromise  is  always  bilateral  and\nmeans mutual adjustment. \u201cSettlement\u201d is termination of legal proceedings\nby mutual consent. If no compromise or settlement is or can be arrived at, no\norder can be passed by the Lok Adalat (Supreme Court 2004b).\n\nLegal Aid, National Legal Services Authority, and State Bodies\n\nThe poor find it difficult to prosecute or defend a case because of the\nhigh costs involved. Eminent judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts\nhave often emphasized the need for free legal aid to the poor. The central\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n596\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\fRole of Alternative Dispute Resolution Methods in the Development of Society: Lok Adalat in India\n\n597\n\nGovernment,  taking  note  of  this  need,  introduced  article 39A  into  the\nConstitution in February 1977.\n\nThe article reads:\n\nThe State shall secure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice\non a basis of equal opportunity, and shall, in particular, provide free legal\naid, by suitable legislation or schemes or in any other way, to ensure that\nopportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reason\nof economic or other disability.\n\nArticles  14  and  22(1)  also  make  it  obligatory  for  the  state  to  ensure\nequality before law and to establish a legal system that promotes justice on the\nbasis  of  equal  opportunity  for  all.  Legal  aid  strives  to  ensure  that  the\nconstitutional pledge is fulfilled in its letter and spirit and that equal justice is\nmade available to the poor, the downtrodden, and other weaker sections of\nsociety.\n\nSince 1952, the Government of India has also addressed the question of\nlegal  aid  for  the  poor  in  various  conferences  of  law  ministers  and  law\ncommissions. In 1960, the Government drew up some guidelines for legal aid\nschemes. In different states, such schemes were put forward through legal aid\nboards and societies, and law departments.\n\nIn 1987, the Legal Services Authorities Act was passed, giving a statutory\nbasis to legal aid programs throughout the country. This act was finally enforced\non  9  November  1995  after  certain  amendments  were  introduced  by  the\nAmendment Act of 1994. The National Legal Services Authority (NALSA)\nwas constituted on 5 December 1995.\n\nNALSA  lays  down  policies  and  principles  for  making  legal  services\navailable under the provisions of the Legal Services Authorities Act and to\nframe effective and economical schemes for legal services. It also disburses\nfunds  and  grants  to  state  legal  services  authorities  and  nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs) for legal aid schemes and programs. NALSA provides\nlegal services, legal aid, and speedy justice through Lok Adalats. The authority\nhas its office in New Delhi and is headed by the chief justice of India, who is\nthe ex-officio patron-in-chief.\n\nSimilarly, state legal services authorities have been formed in every state\ncapital.

It has provided an\nimportant tool for the easy and early settlement of disputes that best suits\nIndian society and culture. The concept of legal services, which includes Lok\nAdalat, is a \u201crevolutionary evolution of resolution of disputes\u201d (Bhatt 2002).\nThere is a need to improve the quality of legal aid by advocates. The\nteeming millions of this country who live below the poverty line in tribal,\nbackward, and far-flung areas look to the legal services authorities for help\nand support in resolving their legal problems. When involved in litigation,\nthey very often feel that they are fighting an unequal battle, in which the\nparty with better financial resources can secure more able legal assistance. The\npayment schedule for legal aid panel advocates should be improved.

Intertwining ADR methodology with justice dispensation\nwould succeed in delivering quicker, inexpensive, good-quality justice that\ncould hold its own versus its counterparts elsewhere in the world. Besides Lok\nAdalat, India has to be a venue for international arbitration.\n\nNew trends in litigation\u2014such as those related to intellectual property\nrights,  cyber  crimes,  environmental  protection,  money  laundering,\ncompetition, telecommunication, taxation, international arbitration, and so\non\u2014need new expertise. The judges need to be brought up to date. A dialogue\nhas  already  been  initiated  to  restructure  law  education  in  such  a  way  that\nafter basic education, different levels of legal education are available to those\nwho aspire to enter the legal profession, those who want to join judicial services,\nand those who wish simply to acquire a degree in law for academic purposes\nor for research. There is a need to make the masses legally literates; and for\nthis, NALSA is doing yeoman service along with the state legal services authority\n(Lahoti 2004).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe large population of India and the unlettered masses have found the\nregular dispensation of justice through the regular courts very cumbersome\nand ineffective. Given the special conditions prevailing in Indian society and\nthe economic structure, highly sensitized legal service is required. The Lok\nAdalat movement is no longer an experiment in India. It is now a success and\nneeds to be replicated in matters that are as yet beyond its domain. Some\nbrainstorming on the part of lawmakers, judges, lawyers, and teachers might\nresult in some modifications so that the same model can be used effectively in\nbusiness disputes. Moreover, there is a need to use the techniques of Lok Adalat\nin conflicts related to public issues where the number of players is quite large\nand the government is also involved one way or the other.\n\nLok Adalats have to reinvent themselves to meet the challenges faced by\nthe judiciary. The new branches of law will require newer tools to come up\nwith decisions that are acceptable to the litigants.\n\nOnly time will tell how far the Lok Adalat movement will go in India\n\nand elsewhere in curbing conflicts and disputes and in spreading harmony.\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n599\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\f600\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nReferences\n\nBharucha, S.

Sometimes the conflict is over\nwho gets the benefits bestowed by government and who bears the costs. Other\ntimes the conflict is over what behavior will be prohibited by government and\nwhat  will  be  permitted.  And  still,  other  times  the  conflict  is  simply  a\ndisagreement  about  which  information  should  be  used  so  that  the  most\nefficient, efficacious, or fair decision will be made.\n\nThis paper is concerned with conflict that is based on competing interests,\ncompeting beliefs, or both, as policy proposals are being considered. Conflict\nover many of these types of policy issues generates such strong feelings or has\nsuch  high  stakes  that  it  is  beyond  compromise.  For  these  issues,  policy\ndeliberation is a zero-sum game. However, other issues\u2014even though they\ngenerate strong competing positions\u2014may yield to compromise solutions.\nSuch  compromises  are  possible  when  interests  or  beliefs  (or  both  together\nwhen they coincide) are not so intense that they preclude finding some common\nground.\n\nWhen compromise solutions are possible for contentious policy issues,\nQ-methodology can help the process of finding mutually acceptable policies\nto address the problems associated with the issue. As I suggest in this paper,\nQ-methodology can contribute to resolving conflicts and finding solutions to\ndifficult policy problems in three ways. It can (i) clarify perspectives (the beliefs\nand interests of decision makers, stakeholders, and the public); (ii) identify\ncompeting problem definitions and solutions, as well as agreements across\ncontending  groups;  and  (iii)  provide  information  that  can  help  forge  new\npolicy solutions that may attract a majority coalition of decision makers or\nstakeholders.\n\nThe main contribution of Q-methodology is that it can make clear the\ncontext of conflict over a policy issue. It can make transparent to all participants\nin deliberation the bases for the conflict, including the different perspectives\n(beliefs and interests) of contending groups and their different understanding\n\n1 Director, International Center for Democratic Governance, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia,\n\nUSA.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n601\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\f602\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nof the nature of the policy problem and its preferred solution. Also, it can\nreveal the interests, beliefs, and preferred actions on which conflicting groups\nof stakeholders agree.\n\nAll of this information\u2014plus ideas for alternative policies that can be\ngarnered from Q-methodology studies\u2014can be used in policy making. Policy\nanalysts  can  use  the  information  to  move  forward  discourse  among  the\nstakeholders  in  search  of  a  compromise  solution.  Also,  they  can  use  the\ninformation to help negotiate a compromise policy action that will attract\nsufficient support to be adopted.\n\nPolicy Characteristics and Policy Conflict\n\nWhat happens to a policy issue in the various stages of the policy process\nis influenced by its \u201ccharacteristics,\u201d which are defined as the information,\nideology  (beliefs),  and  interests  evoked  by  the  policy  issue.  Knowing  the\ncharacteristics  of  a  policy  issue,  one  can  predict  the  broad  features  of  its\ninitiation, analysis, decision making, and implementation.\n\nThis classification of the characteristics of policy issues is borrowed from\n\nCarol Weiss (1983). She wrote:\n\nThe premise that I want to develop is that public policy positions taken by\npolicy actors are the resultant of three sets of forces: their ideologies, their\ninterests (e.g., in power, reputation, financial reward), and the information\nthey have. Each of these three forces interacts with the others in determining\nthe participants\u2019 stance in policy making. (p. 221)\n\nWeiss explained that this model of the formation of policy positions is\none  in  which  there  is  \u201cconstant  and  iterative  interaction\u201d  of  information,\ninterests, and ideology (beliefs).\n\nWith this premise or model, the expectation is that policy issues will\nevoke different levels of information (what is known about the issue), interests,\nand beliefs among policy makers, stakeholders, and the public. That is to say,\nissues will cause participants in policy making to be influenced more strongly\nby one characteristic (or a combination of two characteristics) than by the\nothers. For example, when an issue directly affects the livelihood of the person,\nthat person\u2019s policy position will be most strongly influenced by self-interest\nconsiderations. When an issue is largely technical, the policy position will be\ninfluenced by information. If an issue is related to powerful beliefs, the person\u2019s\nposition will be most influenced by those beliefs.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n602\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\fUsing Q-methodology to Resolve Conflicts and Find Solutions to Contentious Policy Issues\n\n603\n\nOf course, the formation of policy positions will be complicated by the\ninteractions of the three characteristics. Weiss (1983, p. 243) suggested how\nthe characteristics of policy issues could interact:\n\n\u2026if ideological commitments and strong interests are joined in a compelling\nway, they probably represent a combination too formidable to be overcome\nby  an  infusion  of  social  science  knowledge.  If  ideologies  are  weak  or\nconfused, or if there are division in interests among key actions, then social\nscience knowledge is likely to stand a better chance of consideration and\neven action.\n\nPolicy decision making is a social process into which people bring their\nknowledge,  beliefs,  and  interests,  as  well  as  their  political  skills  and  other\nresources. A policy issue affects the various stages of the policy process because\nit influences such things as who will be involved in making the decision and\nwhat they know, want, and believe. Dahl (1961), for example, showed that\ndifferent types of local issues mobilized different sets of decision makers in\nNew Haven, Connecticut.\n\nThus, the impact of policy characteristics on the policy process depends\non the issue involved and the distribution of information, beliefs, and interests\namong policy makers, stakeholders, and the public related to that issue. The\ncharacteristics of an issue are essential in determining which interest groups\nare involved, their interests, and their beliefs. It will also determine the extent\nto which the public takes an interest in policy making and favors one position\nover another.\n\nI suggest that issues can be characterized along these three dimensions:\n\nContinuum 1:  Availability of empirical knowledge\n\nFull empirical information\nabout cause-effect relationships\nunderlying a policy issue\ncan be obtained\n\n(cid:168)(cid:167)\n\nNo empirical information\nabout cause-effect relationships\nunderlying a policy issue\n can be obtained\n\nThis dimension is concerned with both what is knowable and what is\nknown. Empirical knowledge may be available because research can or has\nproduced  reliable  knowledge  of  cause-effect  relationships.  Little  empirical\nknowledge may be available either because research tools are not available to\nprovide that information or because the research has not been undertaken.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n603\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\f604\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nThe availability of knowledge is largely a function of the complexity of\nan issue and its putative cause-effect relationships. Research on technical and\nscientific issues is more likely to yield verifiable empirical conclusions than is\nresearch on behavioral issues.\n\nContinuum 2: Strength of beliefs\n\nStrong beliefs about the\npolicy issue\nheld by relevant groups\n\n(cid:167)\n\n(cid:168)\n\nWeak beliefs about the\npolicy issue\nheld by relevant groups\n\n This dimension is concerned with the extent to which issues are related\nto  or  evoke  strongly  held  beliefs.  If  the  issue  is  related  to  or  evokes  (e.g.,\nthrough the use of symbols) a strongly held belief, it can be expected to influence\nthe policy positions of policy makers. In the absence of strongly held beliefs,\nother characteristics are more likely to be influential.\n\nMoral issues are likely to evoke deeply held beliefs. Thus, discussions of\ngay rights, gay marriages, euthanasia, and cloning will engage the beliefs of\nmany policy makers. Similarly, issues related to important institutions such as\nfamilies, religion, or private property can cause passionate reactions by decision\nmakers and the public. On the other hand, few people have strong beliefs\nabout countless issues such as soil conservation or civil service policies.\n\nContinuum 3: Extent of material rewards and deprivations\n\nSubstantial material rewards or\ndeprivations are distributed\nby the policy issue\n\n(cid:167)\n\n(cid:168)\n\nNo materials rewards or\ndeprivations are distributed\nby the policy issue\n\nThis dimension is concerned with self-interest considerations. It suggests\nthat if substantial rewards (money, power, prestige) from a policy issue are to\nbe gained or deprivations (taxes, punishment) are to be avoided, the policy\nposition of the persons who may receive the rewards or avoid the deprivations\nwill be influenced by self-interest considerations. In the absence of potential\nrewards  and  deprivations,  self-interest  will  not  play  an  important  role  in\nforming a policy position.\n\nFor each of these three dimensions, there may be consensus or conflict.\nFor example, consensus exists when information supports one position on a\npolicy issue, when most participants in the policy process share beliefs related\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n604\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\fUsing Q-methodology to Resolve Conflicts and Find Solutions to Contentious Policy Issues\n\n605\n\nto the policy issue, and when rewards or deprivations are divided in a way that\nevokes no conflicts among interest groups. When consensus exists on all three\ndimensions, potential policy issues do not generate conflict and policy decisions\nare easy.\n\nConflict will occur when decision makers, stakeholders, and the public\ndisagree about the efficacy of information, when they hold different beliefs\nabout an issue, and when they compete for substantial material rewards that\nwill be produced by a policy. The most contentious issues will be those for\nwhich  different  groups  of  organized  stakeholders  have  competing  beliefs,\ncompeting interests, or both. For example, many issues in the policy process\nare characterized by the strongly held beliefs that they evoke among policy\nmakers and the public. These issues include such things as whether abortion\nshould be legal, if ownership of guns should be regulated, if the constitution\nshould be amended to forbid burning the American flag, and whether prayers\nshould be permitted in public schools. These issues evoke contradictory beliefs\namong substantial portions of society and thus provoke continuing conflict\nover public policy related to abortion.\n\nPolicy makers often have a difficult time resolving contentious issues\nwhen different groups (each with substantial numbers, resources, or influence)\nhave  competing  beliefs,  interests,  or  both.  In  many  cases,  they  will  seek\ncompromise policy actions that will be acceptable to as many stakeholders as\npossible.\n\nQ-methodology to Assist in Resolving Contentious Policy Issues\nIn  the  search  for  compromises  and  broadly  acceptable  solutions  to\ncontentious policy issues, Q-methodology can be a useful analytic tool. As\ndescribed in more detail below, it can provide decision makers and stakeholders\nwith information that can assist with the search for compromise. Because, as\nsuggested above, different beliefs and interests are the main sources of policy\nconflict, Q-methodology can facilitate reaching a compromise by clarifying\nthe perspectives and preferences of the participants in enacting governmental\nand organizational policies.\n\nWhat is Q-methodology?\n\nQ-methodology provides policy analysts with a research tool for studying\nsystematically the subjectivity of one person or a group of people. It enables\nthem to explore and understand in more depth the subjective perceptions of\nstakeholders, decision makers, and even themselves about the policy issues\nthey are investigating.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n605\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\f606\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nThis methodology was first proposed in an article published in Nature\nin 1935 by William Stephenson, a British physicist-psychologist. The theory\nunderlying Q-methodology and its application is best described in Stephenson\u2019s\nbook The Study of Behavior, published in 1953. Its application to political\nscience  was  advanced  in  a  book  by  Steven  Brown,  Political  Subjectivity,\npublished in 1980.\n\nQ-methodology has been widely used in research, especially in psychology,\nsociology, social psychology, and political psychology. It has also been used in\nresearch in political science and, to a lesser extent, in public administration\nand public policy (Brown, Durning, and Selden 1999). However, advocates\nof post-positivist methods in policy analysis have urged its wider use by policy\nanalysts (see Dryzek 1990 and Durning 1999).\n\nThe basic ideas of Q-methodology are simple, though its application\nrequires substantial effort to master. It provides procedures for the empirical\nstudy of human subjectivity. The main steps in Q-methodology are as follows:\n\n(cid:127) Creation of a Q-sort, which is a set of statements that are broadly\nrepresentative of the discourse on the topic of interest to the researcher.\n(cid:127) Administration  of  the  Q-sort  to  one  or  more  persons  whose\nperspectives on the topic are of interest to the researchers or analysts.\nEach  person  sorts  the  statements  in  a  quasi-normal  distribution,\nplacing each statement in relation to all other statements on the basis\nof  the  instructions  given  (e.g.,  agree  more,  disagree  more). The\nselection of persons to complete the Q-sorts is purposeful, designed\nto include people whose opinions are of practical or theoretical interest.\n(cid:127) Correlation  of  the  completed  sorts  and  the  factor  analysis  of  the\ncorrelation matrix to identify clusters or groups of participants who\nsorted their statements similarly. In the factor analysis, the individual\nsorters are the variables and the Q-statements are the observations.\n\n(cid:127) Close examination of the weighted average sorts of the different groups\nof  participants  (the  factors  in  the  factor  analysis)  to  identify  the\nattitudes that characterize each of them and that cause them to differ\nfrom one another.\n\nFollowing these steps, the researcher obtains insights into the sorters\u2019\nminds. Through analysis of the Q-sorts, an analyst can map a participant\u2019s\nperspective on the topic that is being researched, that is, the research examines\neach participant\u2019s operant subjectivity. Thus, Q-methodology is an intensive\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n606\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\fUsing Q-methodology to Resolve Conflicts and Find Solutions to Contentious Policy Issues\n\n607\n\nmethodology that provides a picture of an individual\u2019s \u201csubjective\u201d understanding\nof the topic of interest.2\n\nThe  designation  of  this  method  as  \u201cQ\u201d-methodology  is  intended  to\ndifferentiate it from \u201cR\u201d-methodology, which comprises the statistical methods\nused for \u201cobjective\u201d research in the social sciences. The differences between\nthe \u201cQ\u201d- and \u201cR\u201d-methods are not simply a matter of technique; they reflect\ndifferent philosophies of inquiry that encompass competing epistemologies\nand understandings of what constitutes sound scientific practice. Some of the\nkey differences between Q-methodology and R-methodology are:\n\n(cid:127) Q-methodology seeks to understand how individuals think (i.e., the\nstructure of their thoughts) about the research topic of interest. R-\nmethodology  identifies  the  structure  of  opinion  or  attitudes  in  a\npopulation. Thus, the results of the Q-method identify the perspective\nof  an  individual,  or  individuals  with  common  views,  on  the  issue\nbeing  researched;  the  results  of  the  R-methods,  describe  the\ncharacteristics  of  a  population  that  are  associated  statistically  with\nopinions, attitudes, or behavior being investigated.\n\n(cid:127) While R-methods are intended for the \u201cobjective\u201d analysis of research\nissues,  Q-methodology  is  designed  to  study  subjectivity.\nR-methodology  is  founded  on  logical  positivism  in  which  the\nresearcher is an outside objective observer. In contrast, Q-methodology\nis more closely related to post-positivist ideas that reject the possibility\nof observer objectivity and question the assumption that the observer\u2019s\nviewpoint is, if not objective, then in some sense superior to that of\nany  other  observer,  including  the  person  being  observed. Thus,\nQ-methodology is in tune with phenomenological, hermeneutic, and\nquantum theories.\n\n(cid:127) Q-methodology  is  an  intensive  method  that  seeks  in-depth\nunderstanding of how at least one person thinks about the topic of\ninvestigation. As an intensive method, Q-methodology requires a small\nnumber of well-selected subjects to complete the Q-sort, which is a\nsample  of  the  communications  about  the  topic  of  interest.  In\ncomparison,  R-methods  are  extensive  methodologies  designed  to\nextract  understandings  of  populations  by  surveying  representative\nsamples of them; thus, they require\u2014depending on population size\n\n2\n\nFor a fuller discussion of Q-methodology and its use, see Brown (1980), McKeown and Thomas\n(1988), and Brown, Durning, and Selden (1999).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n607\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\f608\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nand sampling techniques\u2014data drawn from a certain percentage of\nthe population of interest.3\n\nDryzek (1990) explained Q-methodology and its value as a post-positivist\n\nmethod as follows:\n\nThe hallmark of Q-methodology is that it takes the subjective, self-referential\nopinions of respondents seriously in seeking to model the whole subject as\n[they apprehend] a particular situation.... (p. 176) Q is essentially interpretive\nin its philosophy of social science. As such, it abjures both objectivism and\ncausal explanation\u2026. Instead, Q seeks a \u201cfeeling for the organism\u201d [Brown].\nIt engages in intensive analysis of particular individuals or collectivities in\norder to apprehend the fullness of their subjectivity in the subject\u2019s own\nterms\u2026.  It  does  not  (and  cannot)  seek  causal  explanation  of  individual\nactions. That is, Q interprets the actions of individuals in terms of their\nconsistency (or otherwise) with the subjective orientations it uncovers....\n(pp. 178\u2013179) The encounter Q contrives is a thoroughly egalitarian one\nand the roles of observer and responded are interchangeable. (p. 184)\n\nHow Can It Help?\n\nQ-methodology  can  assist  with  the  search  for  compromise  policy\nsolutions for contentious issues in three ways. It can assist decision makers\nand stakeholders to:\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127) Understand more completely the interests and beliefs of contending\nstakeholders and search for commonalities among them; for example,\nit can help determine if positions on an issue are bipolar or multipolar.\nIdentify  different  and  competing  definitions  of  problems  to  be\naddressed by a policy and the competing solutions linked to those\nproblem definitions. This type of analysis can also identify actions\nthat different groups of stakeholders find mutually agreeable.\nForge a new solution that has not been advocated by any group of\nstakeholders, but may attract the support of a majority of stakeholders.\n\n(cid:127)\n\nAs  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  conflict  over  policy  issues  in\ngovernments and organizations is often based on disagreements about which\nvalues should guide the decision, which interests should benefit from them,\nor both. Q-methodology can clarify for participants in the policy process the\n\n3 This comparison of Q- and R-methodologies is taken from Brown, Durning, and Selden (1999).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n608\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\fUsing Q-methodology to Resolve Conflicts and Find Solutions to Contentious Policy Issues\n\n609\n\nbases for the conflict and, perhaps, possible cooperation. It can enhance dialogue\nby  precluding  misunderstandings  of  the  perspectives  and  motivations  of\ncontending groups of stakeholders. Also, it can help policy analysts to engage\nstakeholders in discourse about the issue and find widely acceptable compromises.\nEach of these three uses of Q-methodology is discussed below in more\n\ndetail.\n\nClarifying Stakeholder Perspectives4\n\nQ-methodology  makes  transparent  the  values,  beliefs,  interests,  and\nknowledge  that  underlie  the  competing  positions  of  decision  makers,\nstakeholders,  and  the  public  on  issues  to  be  decided.  For  example,  the\nQ-method  has  been  used  to  identify  stakeholder  perspectives  related  to\nenvironmental  policies  and  specific  controversial  policies  (e.g.,  abortion).\nStudies of this type have addressed many different issues, including forests\n(Hooker  2001,  Clarke  2002,  Steelman  and  Maguire  1999),  coastal  zone\nmanagement (Shilin, Durning, and Gajdamaschko 2003), nature restoration\n(Wooley and McGinnis 2000), wolf management (Byrd 2002), biotechnology\nin Mexico (Galve-Peritore and Peritore 1995), corrections policy (Baker and\nMeyer 2002, 2003), and diversity in New Zealand (Wolf 2004).\n\nTwo good examples of these types of studies are Hooker\u2019s (2001) study\nof how stakeholders think about the relationship of individuals and society to\nforests,  and  Deitrick\u2019s  research  (1998)  on  how  stakeholders  in  Pittsburgh\nperceive the issue of how brownfields should be redeveloped.\n\nThe purpose of Hooker\u2019s research was to identify competing perspectives\nrelated to forest policy. She wanted to understand the competing concepts of\npreservation,  conservation,  and  development  that  influence  individual\nperspectives on forest policy. She used Q-methodology for that purpose, gaining\ninsight into how different stakeholders perceive the relationship of individuals\nto society and to forests.\n\nTo carry out the study, she created a 60-statement Q-sort that was a\nsample of 400 statements taken from literature on forest and natural resource\npolicy.  She  administered  the  sort  to  a  select  group  of  diverse  participants,\nincluding  forest  landowners,  government  officials,  forest  industry\nrepresentatives,  trade  association  representatives,  scientists,  leaders  of\nconservation groups, academics, and public interest group representatives. A\ntotal of 189 participants ranked the 60 statements on a quasi-normal array\nfrom -5 (most disagree) to +5 (most agree).\n\n4 The discussion of the three uses of Q-methodology to find solutions to contentious issues is taken\n\nfrom Durning and Brown (forthcoming).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n609\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\f610\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nHooker used principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation\nto analyze the Q-sort correlation matrix, and she identified five factors, which\nrepresent five perspectives, that influence the positions that people take on\nforestry issues. She labeled these factors as New Stewards, New Conservationists,\nIndividualists, Traditional  Stewards,  and  Environmental  Activists,  and  she\nexplained  how  these  have  different,  but  sometimes  overlapping,  views  on\npolicies regarding the use of forests.\n\nThe purpose of Deitrick\u2019s (1998) research was to determine the different\nstakeholder views on proposals to redevelop brownfields in Pittsburgh. She\nconstructed her 24-statement Q-sort from interviews with stakeholders (people\nwith a direct interest in the brownfields issue), newspaper articles, letters to\nthe editor, and other published materials. She asked stakeholders from the\nprivate, public, and nonprofit sectors, plus community activists in the areas\naffected by brownfields, to sort the statements from -4 (most disagree) to +4\n(most agree). In all, 117 persons completed the Q-sort.\n\nDeitrick analyzed the correlation matrix of the completed Q-sorts using\nprincipal components factor analysis and varimax rotation. She identified three\nfactors, which can be considered to be separate perspectives related to this\nissue.  She  labeled  them  as  (i)  the  development  perspective,  (ii)  the\ncommunity\u2014environmental  nonprofit/activist  perspective,  and  (iii)  the\ntechnical perspective.\n\nBoth of these studies provided novel social science knowledge about the\nperspectives related to these issues, and also offered decision makers information\non the rival views of contending groups. Hooker\u2019s study gave decision makers\na clearer picture of the clashing views on the use of forests, and Deitrick\u2019s\nstudy helped local decision makers understand better the differing perspectives\non this difficult issue.\n\nIn her article, Hooker not only identified the different perspectives, but\nalso  suggested  how  that  information  could  be  used.  She  proposed  that\nknowledge of the four different perspectives, especially information on the\nviews they have in common, would be a good starting point for structuring\nbeneficial interactions between factors. She wrote:\n\nConversations among analysts and members of the public who are interested\nin  forest  policy  can  use  the  new  framework  of  beliefs  identified  in  this\nstudy to redefine a policy agenda as well as commence facilitating dialogue.\n(p. 174)\n\nHooker  also  suggested  that  the  results  of  her  study  could  be  used  to\nassist  an  effort  to  \u201cstructure  a  more  effective  public  involvement  strategy\u201d\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n610\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\fUsing Q-methodology to Resolve Conflicts and Find Solutions to Contentious Policy Issues\n\n611\n\n(p. 174). She argued that citizen participation should be set up so that all of\nthe four perspectives were represented in the discussions. By including people\nwith the four main perspectives in public hearings and advisory groups, policy\nmakers could make sure that all of the competing views are heard.\n\nDeitrick  concluded  that  \u201cplanning  and  policy\u201d  could  benefit  from\nunderstanding the three perspectives her study identified. She agreed with\nHooker  that  knowledge  of  these  three  perspectives  should  improve  public\nparticipation by ensuring that each of the three perspectives is represented\nwhen brownfield issues are discussed. Also, she pointed out that the study\nidentified not only the disagreements among the three factors, but also the\nways  that  they  agreed. Thus,  conversations  among  people  with  different\nperspectives could start with areas of agreement.\n\nIdentifying Competing Problem Definitions and Solutions\n\nMaxwell and Brown (1999) provide an example of how Q-methodology\ncan be used as a consulting or organizational tool to help an organization\nmake decisions to address a complex problem. Their case concerned a middle\nschool in which faculty members disagreed on how best to deal with increasing\nlevels of student misconduct. The consultants were brought in to help the\nschool manage the conflict and to find solutions to the problem that would\nbe widely accepted.\n\nAs their first step, they conducted a Q-methodology study to determine\nhow  members  of  the  organization  understood  the  problem  of  student\nmisconduct. They  began  by  interviewing  the  teachers,  staff  members,  and\nadministrators in the middle school, asking them for their thoughts on the\nproblems facing the school related to misconduct. Through these open-ended\ninterviews, they compiled a list of 44 problems identified by the interviewees.\nThe  following  are  examples  of  the  problems  perceived  by  one  or  more\ninterviewees:\n\n(cid:127) Too many office detentions are given.\n(cid:127) Kids do not want to put in the effort.\n(cid:127) Teachers do not know how to punish kids effectively.\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127) Kids have too many rights.\n\nParents do not respect the teachers.\n\nThe 44 problem statements were used as the Q-sort. Faculty and staff\nwere asked to sort the statements into an array from +4 (most important) to\n-4 (least important). In all, 30 participants completed the Q-sorts.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n611\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\f612\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nThe Q-sorts were correlated and the correlation matrix was factor analyzed\nusing the centroid method with varimax rotation. The factor analysis showed\nthat most participants loaded on one of two factors, which the consultants\nlabeled as (i) the Resentment Factor and (ii) the Differentiating Factor.\n\nAn  examination  of  these  two  factors  indicated  that  the  participants\nloading significantly on the Resentment Factor strongly identified with teachers\nand  staff  in  general,  and  had  complaints  against  students,  parents,\nadministrators, and the school board, all of whom were viewed as \u201cplacing\nthem in an untenable position\u201d (p. 38). While the Resentment Factor was\nconcerned largely with inter-group relations, the Differentiating Factor was\nmore  concerned  with  intra-group  relations.  The  participants  loading\nsignificantly on this factor wanted to recognize that the school had both helpful\nand harmful elements. They differentiated between groups of students (those\nneeding support, as well as those needing discipline) and groups of teachers\n(those who punish effectively and those who do not).\n\nThe  consultants  presented  the  results  of  the  first  part  of  the  Q-\nmethodology  study  to  the  participants,  showing  them  the  statements  that\nrepresented the sources of disagreement about the issue, but also pointing out\nthe statements on which they agreed. They likened this process to \u201cholding a\nmirror up to the teachers and staff\u2026so that they might see themselves and co-\nworkers more clearly\u201d (p. 40).\n\nIn the second part of the study, the same participants were interviewed\nto elicit their proposals to solve the problems that had been identified. They\ncame up with a list of 35 potential solutions, which became the Q-sort that\nwas completed by 28 faculty and staff members. They were asked to sort the\n35 potential solutions in an array from +4 (least effective) to +4 (most effective).\nThis  time  the  consultants  used  judgmental  rotation  rather  than  varimax\nrotation to analyze the Q-sort. They found three different perspectives, which\nthey  described  as  (i)  Punishment  (solve  the  discipline  problem  through\npunishment), (ii) Quarantine (use special programs to separate children causing\nproblems from others), and (iii) Coordination (get teachers and staff to work\ntogether more effectively through cooperation and coordination).\n\nIn addition to these competing approaches to solving the problem, the\nQ-sorts identified actions that all three groups agreed should be implemented\nor should be avoided. For example, all three groups agreed that actions should\nbe taken to:\n\n(cid:127) Establish a procedure for parents to sign an agreement about the rules\nof conduct and the consequences for misconduct that will apply to\ntheir child; and\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n612\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\fUsing Q-methodology to Resolve Conflicts and Find Solutions to Contentious Policy Issues\n\n613\n\n(cid:127) Consistently follow rules and regulations already in existence, such as\n\nthe Student Conduct Code.\n\nOn  the  basis  of  the  results  of  their  Q-methodology  research,  the\nconsultants informed school administrators about the differences of opinion\non the causes of student misconduct and the differing preferences for actions\nto address the problems. Also, they identified the actions that were agreeable\nto all three factors as well as those they unanimously opposed.\n\nOther studies report a similar approach to identifying competing problem\ndefinitions and solutions for other policy issues. For example, a paper by Brown\net al. (2004) describes a 2-day workshop to \u201cimprove practices and to establish\nsome  common  ground  amid  the  controversies  and  conflicts  surrounding\ncarnivore management.\u201d At the start of this workshop, 30 participants with\nvery different perspectives (e.g., ranchers, environmental activists, scientists,\nand state and federal government managers) brainstormed about \u201cthe nature\nof problems associated with carnivore conservation.\u201d The almost 300 problems\nidentified  by  the  group  were  recorded  and  a  sample  of  51  of  them  was\nincorporated  into  a  Q-sort  that  the  participants  completed. This  exercise\nidentified  four  different  decision  structures  (perspectives)  on  the  issue  of\ncarnivore management.\n\nAfter that, the researchers elicited opinions from the participants about\npossible solutions to the problems that had been identified. The solutions\nwere recorded, and 40 of them were incorporated into a Q-sort, which was\nadministered to the same group of participants. An analysis of those sorts\nfound four factors, each a different decision structure (perspective) on how\nthe problems associated with carnivore conservation should be addressed.\n\nAs with the middle school study, this workshop on carnivore management\nidentified some possible policy actions that would be supported\u2014or at least\nnot opposed\u2014by the four groups. These proposed actions are good starting\npoints for policy makers. By identifying both the differences and commonalities\nin decision structures, Q-methodology provides policy makers with information\nthat can help them put together a winning coalition to support policy actions.\nAn article by Gargan and Brown (1993) presents a case showing how\nQ-methodology  can  clarify  \u201cthe  perspectives  of  decision  makers\u201d  and,  in\nconjunction with other procedures, can ferret out \u201cprudent courses of action\u201d\n(p.  348).  According  to  these  authors,  the  special  contribution  of\nQ-methodology to decision making is \u201cthat it helps overcome the limitations\nof the mind in dealing with complexity, and also serves to locate elements of\nconsensus (if they exist) that might otherwise go unnoticed in the emotional\nturmoil of political debate.\u201d\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n613\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\f614\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nThe case concerns the formation of a strategic plan by a Private Industry\nCouncil (PIC), a local nonprofit agency primarily responsible for implementing\nthe federal Job Training Partnership Act in a rural Midwestern county. The\nprogram\u2019s  goal  was  to  improve  the  employment  chances  of  people  having\ndifficulty getting a job by providing them with training and skill development.\nThe PIC board of directors decided to develop a strategic plan to respond\nto opportunities and challenges it faced. First, the PIC board used nominal group\ntechnique to identify major issues and problems facing the agency. The board\nmembers answered this question: \u201cWhat issues and problems must be considered\nas most important and of highest priority for PIC over the next 2 to 4 years if the\nemployment needs of the hard-to-serve are to be dealt with effectively?\u201d (p. 349).\nA total of 33 answers were collected and were used as a Q-sort. Each of\nthe  10  board  members  was  asked  to  sort  the  statements  according  to  the\nfollowing condition:\n\nSince  all  of  the  issues  raised  cannot  be  addressed  simultaneously,  some\npriorities  must  be  established.  To  do  this,  you  need  to  rank  order  the\nstatements from those which you think should be the most important for\nPIC to deal with in the next two to four years (+4), to those which should\nbe considered least important (-4). (p. 351)\n\nThe  Q-sorts  were  correlated,  and  the  correlation  matrix  was  factor\nanalyzed using the centroid method with varimax rotation. The factor analysis\nproduced  three  factors,  each  representing  different  preferences  for  PIC\npriorities. These  factors  can  be  viewed  as  decision  structures  based  on  the\nvalues, beliefs, interests, and ideology of each of the board members.\n\nGargan and Brown noted that the different policy preferences revealed\nin the Q-sorts sometimes converged into agreement while at other times they\nconflicted sharply. Sometimes two of the factors (say, factors A and B) converged\nto  agree  on  statement  while  factor  C  disagreed  with  them.  On  another\nstatement, factors A and C agreed, but factor B disagreed. On some proposed\npolicy actions, all three agreed; on others, all three disagreed.\n\nBy identifying the underlying conflicting perspectives and their views of\ndifferent actions, Q-methodology provided valuable information to the board\nmembers who were going to decide about the strategic plan. Brown and Gargan\nsuggested three ways that the decision makers could use the information from\nthis Q-method study:\n\n(cid:127) Create a committee to write the group\u2019s strategic plan, including a\n\nrepresentative of the three groups;\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n614\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\fUsing Q-methodology to Resolve Conflicts and Find Solutions to Contentious Policy Issues\n\n615\n\n(cid:127) Adopt policies for which there is consensus support; and\n(cid:127) Use insights from the study to help formulate mutually beneficial\n\ndeals and build coalitions to support a set of actions.\n\nFinding New Solutions\n\nMaxwell and Brown (1999) and Gargan and Brown (1993) illustrated\nhow decision makers could use the results of Q-methodology to help with\ndecisions on important issues. They showed that Q-methodology provides\ninformation about (i) consensus statements on which all of the factors agree,\n(ii) statements on which some factors\u2014but not all\u2014agree, and (iii) statements\nshowing the greatest disagreements among the factors. This information can\nbe employed in different ways to assist decision makers in making good choices.\nOther research has shown how Q-methodology can be used innovatively\nto help decision makers facing intractable problems. Van Eeten\u2019s (2001) research\ndemonstrated the utility of Q-methodology to help \u201crecast intractable problems\u201d\nto make them tractable.5 He presented a case study in which Q methodology\nwas used to change an intractable problem into one that can be solved. The\ncase was based on his experience in 1998 as a consultant to the Government of\nthe Netherlands. He was involved in a study to determine the future policy for\nexpanding Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol Airport. A controversial expansion of the\nairport (requiring the building of a fifth runway) had been approved in 1995,\nand future expansion was due to come up again soon for consideration.\n\nWhen discussing another expansion of the airport with stakeholders, he\nfound bipolar positions. Stakeholders advocating an expansion of Schiphol\nAirport  argued  that  it  was  necessary  for  the  economic  benefits  that  would\nresult. Stakeholders opposing expansion argued that the environmental costs\nwere too great for it to be allowed to happen.\n\n As part of his work, van Eeten wanted to get a better understanding of\nhow stakeholders viewed this issue: Were views really bipolar? To answer that\nquestion, he wanted stakeholders to reveal their views rather than being forced\ninto the predefined categories (e.g., business orientation vs. environmentalists).\nTo do so, he conducted a Q-study using Q-methodology. He collected 200\nstatements about the expansion of the airport from media archives, advocacy\npapers, interviews, and transcripts of several stakeholder meetings. From these\nstatements, he extracted a sample of 80 statements for a Q-sort and administered\nit to 38 stakeholders.\n\n5 Also see Dayton (2000), who suggested how Q-methodology could be used to assist dialogue about\nintractable issues, such as global climate change.  For another example, see Focht and Lawler (2000).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n615\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\f616\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nThe participants in his Q-methodology study were selected to reflect the\ndistribution of views on the expansion issue, including people who worked\nfor airlines, airport management, different levels and sectors of government,\nnational environmental organizations, local citizens, environmental groups, and\ncommercial or regional economic interests. The participants were asked to sort\nthe 80 statements into seven groups from -3 (most disagree) to +3 (most agree).\nVan  Eeten  analyzed  the  38  Q-sorts  by  correlating  them  and  factor\nanalyzing  the  correlation  matrix  using  the  centroid  method  with  varimax\nrotation. He identified four factors containing five \u201cpolicy arguments\u201d (which\ncould also be understood as \u201cdecision structures\u201d). He labeled these as:\n\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\nPolicy Argument A: Societal integration of a growing airport;\nPolicy Argument B1: Expansion of aviation infrastructure as a necessity\nin the face of international competition;\nPolicy Argument B2: Expansion of civil aviation as an unjustified use\nof public funds;\nPolicy Argument C: Ecological modernization of the civil aviation\nsector; and\nPolicy Argument D: Sustainable solutions to a growing demand for\nmobility.\n\nVan Eeten noted that policy arguments B1 and B2 captured the main\npublic debate on the issue, and they represented a dichotomy of views that\ncould  not  be  reconciled.  The  clash  of  these  two  views  made  the  issue\nintractable\u2014they offered no room for compromise. However, he also observed\nthat the Q study had identified three other perspectives, policy arguments not\ncaptured in the B1 vs. B2 arguments. He wrote,\n\nArguments A, C, and D\u2026each state that there is more to the problem\nthan what key stakeholders are now considering. Although these arguments\nare habitually collapsed into and treated as part and parcel of the positions\nfor or against growth, the analysis indicates that they are, in fact, relatively\nindependent. Instead of conflating the alternatives in A, C, and D into B1\nor  B2,  the  data  insist  that  they  can  be  sensibly  viewed  as  relatively\nindependent from (indeed orthogonal to) the continuum for-or-against\nfurther growth. (2001, p. 404)\n\nVan  Eeten  suggested  that  the  alternatives  corresponding  to  policy\narguments A, C, and D should be brought into the debate. They could be\ndecoupled from the B1-B2 arguments and placed on the policy agenda for\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n616\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\fUsing Q-methodology to Resolve Conflicts and Find Solutions to Contentious Policy Issues\n\n617\n\nconsideration. According to him, their addition would present a \u201cricher package\nof proposals\u201d for consideration by decision makers. He wrote, \u201cthe alternatives\nposed by policy arguments A, C, and D address the expansion proposal by\ndefining the problem more tractably as something in which decision makers\ncan intervene in real and important ways\u201d (2001, p. 406).\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper, I have suggested that Q-methodology can be a valuable\ntool for policy analysts to help resolve contentious policy issues for which\ncompromise is possible. The paper maintains that some issues generate conflict\nbased on differing beliefs held by groups of stakeholders. Other issues evoke\nconflict  because  they  provide  benefits  and  impose  costs,  and  different\nstakeholders want to maximize the benefits they receive from the policy and\nminimize the costs. Still other issues create conflict because they evoke both\ncompeting beliefs and interest in gaining benefits and avoiding costs.\n\nQ-methodology  can  help  resolve  conflict  over  policy  decisions  by\nclarifying  the  beliefs  and  interests  of  different  groups  of  stakeholders  with\ncompeting positions on a policy issue. Also, it can reveal how different groups\nunderstand (or define) the problem that a policy is supposed to address, along\nwith the preferred solution to the problem. This information can be used by\nanalysts to help structure a productive discourse among competing stakeholders\nthat avoids misunderstandings of the motives and preferences of the competing\ngroups. This transparency can help groups negotiate compromises.\n\nIn  addition,  as  shown  in  the  research  summarized  in  this  paper,\nQ-methodology can help resolve contentious issues in other ways. It can be used to:\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\nStructure an effective public and stakeholder involvement program\nby making sure that representatives of all perspectives are invited to\nparticipate in hearings and discussions (Hooker 2001, Deitrick 1998,\nGargan and Brown 1993).\nIdentify  ways  that  different  groups  agree,  often  finding  consensus\nactions that can be adopted with little controversy (Deitrick 1998,\nMaxwell and Brown 1999, Gargan and Brown 1993).\n\n(cid:127) Create insights to help formulate mutually beneficial deals and build\ncoalitions to support a set of actions (Gargan and Brown 1993).\nFind new policy alternatives that can make a policy issue more tractable\n(van Eeten 2001).\n\n(cid:127)\n\nThese uses of Q-methodology to help solve difficult issues suggest that\n\nthis analytic tool should be more widely used and taught.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 5.pmd\n\n617\n\n22/11/2006, 8:57 AM\n\n\f618\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nReferences\n\nBaker, Ralph, and Fred Meyer. 2002.

Health, like education,\nis a \u201cmerit good,\u201d which, if left to individuals, is generally under-consumed.\nThis is so especially among the poor who have meager resources. Merit goods\nalso have benefits that are not confined to the individuals who pay for it; the\nsociety at large also benefits. Health care being a merit good, private markets\nmay restrict access. In India, the provision of health care is marred by class\ninequalities,  the  denial  of  opportunities  to  disadvantaged  groups,  low\naccessibility to the lower classes of society, and rampant corruption. The same\ntrend is noticeable in Punjab (Government of Punjab 2004). Government\nmust either provide health-care services or regulate their provision by the private\nsector to ensure equitable access particularly for the poor (Walsh 1997).\n\nAt present, there are three health-care policy initiatives for the poor: (i)\nexemption from the user fee in government hospitals; (ii) free treatment in\nprivate super-specialty hospitals (within a defined proportion of total patients);\nand (iii) health insurance.\n\n This paper examines health care for the poor in India, particularly in\n\nthe state of Punjab.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe study used both primary and secondary data. The secondary data\ncame from various government and private sector reports. The primary data\nwere collected with the help of a structured questionnaire with five sections:\ngeneral information about the respondents, awareness of the yellow card (an\nentitlement card for groups below the poverty line), use of the yellow card at\ngovernment and private hospitals, level of satisfaction with health-care services,\n\n1\n\nProfessor and Chairperson, Department of Public Administration, Panjab University, Chandigarh,\nIndia.\n\n2 Research Fellow, Department of Public Administration,  Panjab University, Chandigarh, India.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n623\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\f624\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nand health insurance. The questionnaire was pretested before it was finalized.\nCopies  of  the  final  questionnaire  were  given  to  100  respondents,  mainly\nresidents of Mundi Kharar village in the Kharar development block of Ropar\ndistrict in Punjab state. All the respondents belonged to the scheduled caste,\nthe lowest class of society. In Punjab, as in the rest of the country, most of the\npoor  belong  to  the  scheduled  caste.  Data  were  also  collected  through\nobservation,  to  supplement  the  information  obtained  through  the\nquestionnaire.  The  data  were  analyzed  through  simple  techniques  like\npercentages and averages.\n\nResource Allocation to Health Sector and Inequity\nin Health Services\n\nThe Indian economy has been growing at a rate of 5% since the mid-\n1980s, barring a few years of economic crisis. The benefits of economic growth,\nhowever, have not percolated to the social sector. The health sector\u2014a major\npart of the social sector\u2014instead of gaining has suffered on account of the\nallocation of funds during the period of high growth. Public expenditure on\nhealth was 3.12% of total government expenditure during the first year of\neconomic liberalization (1992\u20131993) and declined to 2.99% in 2003\u20132004\n(see Table 1). The combined expenditure on health as a percentage of gross\ndomestic product (GDP) follows the same trend, according to Table 1: from\n1.01% in 1992\u20131993, it went down to 0.99% in 2003\u20132004.\n\nTable 1: Public Expenditures on Health, Disaggregated\n\nYear\n\n% of Total Government Expenditure\nCenter\n\nStates\n\nTTTTTotalotalotalotalotal\n\nStates\n\n% of GDP\nCenter\n\n4.96\n5.16\n4.85\n4.98\n4.85\n4.94\n4.98\n4.80\n4.65\n4.41\n4.27\n4.12\n\n1.31\n1.49\n1.62\n1.78\n1.50\n1.55\n1.58\n1.75\n1.87\n1.99\n1.67\n1.69\n\n3.123.123.123.123.12\n3.283.283.283.283.28\n3.263.263.263.263.26\n3.393.393.393.393.39\n3.213.213.213.213.21\n3.323.323.323.323.32\n3.333.333.333.333.33\n3.343.343.343.343.34\n3.333.333.333.333.33\n3.253.253.253.253.25\n3.063.063.063.063.06\n2.992.992.992.992.99\n\n0.79\n0.81\n0.77\n0.75\n0.72\n0.74\n0.76\n0.78\n0.77\n0.73\n0.77\n0.73\n\n0.22\n0.25\n0.25\n0.26\n0.21\n0.21\n0.23\n0.26\n0.28\n0.30\n0.26\n0.26\n\nTTTTTotalotalotalotalotal\n\n1.011.011.011.011.01\n1.051.051.051.051.05\n1.011.011.011.011.01\n1.001.001.001.001.00\n0.930.930.930.930.93\n0.950.950.950.950.95\n0.990.990.990.990.99\n1.041.041.041.041.04\n1.051.051.051.051.05\n1.031.031.031.031.03\n1.031.031.031.031.03\n0.990.990.990.990.99\n\nSource: National Accounts Statistics, 2004, Table Sl.1, pages 196\u2013197, cited in Planning Commission, 2005.\n\n1992\u20131993\n1993\u20131994\n1994\u20131995\n1995\u20131996\n1996\u20131997\n1997\u20131998\n1998\u20131999\n1999\u20132000\n2000\u20132001\n2001\u20132002\n2002\u20132003\n2003\u20132004\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n624\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\fHealth Care for the Poor in India with Special Reference to Punjab State\n\n625\n\nNot only has public investment in health been declining, public health\nbenefits have been accruing mainly to those who are better off. Marginalized\nand socially disadvantaged people have been hit hard (Government of India\n2002). By one estimate, the infant mortality rate is 2.5 times higher among\nthe poorest 20% of the society than among the richest 20% (Deogaonkar\n2004). Mahal et al. (2002) also found bias in favor of the rich in public policy.\nAccording to them, the poorest 20% of the population receive only about\n10% of the total net public subsidy. The richest 20%, on the other hand, get\naround 30% of the subsidy (Planning Commission 2005). The mushrooming\nof private sector hospitals has further widened the gap between  urban and\nrural areas and between the classes of society. The Hindu in its editorial on 5\nApril 2005 stated:\n\nInternational studies have shown nearly 80 percent of patients in India\nresorting to private caregivers for major and minor ailments\u2014despite the\nexistence of a public health system of a sort. Such patronage and steadily\nincreasing  demand  have  resulted  in  a  significant  expansion  of  private\nhospital bed capacity, although this is concentrated largely in urban India\nand  remains  unaffordable  to  the  overwhelming  majority  of  the  people.\nThe  strong  growth  of  private  healthcare  has  understandably  led  to  the\ndemand for a system of oversight in the interests of equity, credibility, and\nprofessional accountability.\n\nThe case of Punjab state is not much different. Punjab state is one of the\nrichest states of the Indian Union. Its growth rate (around 5%) was the highest\namong Indian states for about 30 years, although it has started to decelerate\nrecently. Yet, despite being the richest state in economic development, Punjab\nlags behind in social development, particularly in health. According to the\nHuman Development Report 2004 prepared by the Punjab government, public\ninvestment in health in Punjab is very low. The lack of investment has affected\nprimary health care the most and is pushing people, particularly the poor,\ntoward expensive and unregulated private sector providers (Government of\nPunjab 2004). The state budget allocates meager resources to both the primary\nand secondary health-care sectors. Table 2 shows that the state allocates only\naround 4% of total expenditure to health. The total expenditure on medical\nand public health is only 0.79% of the net state domestic product, which is\nbelow the average expenditure of 0.99% nationwide.\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n625\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\f626\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nTable 2: Punjab Government Expenditure on Medical and Public Health\n\n(Rs10 million)\n\nItem\n\nTotal Expenditure\nExpenditure on Medical and Public Health\nNet State Domestic Product (NSDP)\n\nYear\n\n2003\u20132004\n(Actual)\n\n2004\u20132005\n(Revised)\n\n15,701.92\n556.70\n69,840.82\n\n19,220.07\n704.77\n\u2013\n\nExpenditure on Medical and Public Health as % of Total Expenditure\nExpenditure on Medical and Public Health as % of NSDP\n\n3.54\n0.79\n\n3.66\n\u2013\n\n\u2013 = not available\n\nSource: Punjab State Budget for 2005\u20132006. www.punjabgovt.nic.in.\n\nExemption from User Fee in Government Hospitals\n\nSince the start of economic liberalization, privatization, and globalization\nin the 1990s, the Punjab government has introduced two drastic reforms in\nhealth policy. First, it set up the Punjab Health Systems Corporation (PHSC)\nin  October  1995,  under  the  World  Bank-sponsored  State  Health  Systems\nDevelopment Project II, and transferred more than 150 health-care institutions\nrun by the government to PHSC. To mobilize more resources, the hospitals\nno longer provide free services and instead charge all patients a user fee, barring\na few categories of patients including people below the poverty line.\n\nThe second policy decision is the significant opening up of health-care\nservices to the private corporate sector. Private sector hospitals have been getting\nland and facilities at subsidized rates and are expected in return to provide free\ntreatment to yellow card holders (people below the poverty line)\u2014up to 10%\nof outpatients and 5% of inpatients. Each year these hospitals are required to\nprovide the details of their yellow card holder patients to the Punjab Urban\nDevelopment Authority (PUDA), the organization that allotted land to these\nhospitals at subsidized rates.\n\nIn  government  hospitals,  under  the  new  policy,  the  poor  are  exempt\nfrom  user  charges,  as  stated  earlier.  However,  the  outcome  is  far  from  the\nrhetoric.\n\nPrimary data show that only a negligible proportion of people below the\npoverty line avail themselves of exemptions from user charges at government\nhospitals. According to Table 3, the yellow card holders treated free of cost\nmake up only 0.4% of the patients treated in the outpatient department of\nthe Kharar civil hospital in Punjab in 2002\u20132003, and the proportion further\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n626\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\fHealth Care for the Poor in India with Special Reference to Punjab State\n\n627\n\nTable 3: Treatment of Patients in the Outpatient Department\nof Civil Hospital Kharar, Ropar District, Punjab\n\nTime Period\n\nYellow Card\nHolders Treated\n\nTotal Patients\nTreated\n\n% of Yellow Card Holders\n  to Total Patients Treated\n\nSept 2002\u2013Sept 2003\nSept 2003\u2013Sept 2004\nSept 2004\u2013Sept 2005\n\n321\n18\n7\n\n80,109\n78,107\n79,553\n\nSource: Health Management Information System, Civil Hospital, Kharar, Punjab.\n\n0.4\n0.02\n0.008\n\ndeclined  to  a  negligible  0.008%  in  2004\u20132005.  In  the  district  hospital  of\nRopar, of the 148,300 patients in 2004\u20132005, only four were yellow card\nholders.\n\nAccording to the field survey, two main factors\u2014ignorance among the\npoor about the free treatment, and the complex and cumbersome procedure\nfor getting and renewing the yellow cards\u2014are constraining the access of the\npoor to public health-care services.\n\nAround 58% of the survey respondents were yellow card holders at some\npoint. Seventy-five percent of the respondents were not aware that a yellow\ncard holder is exempted from user fees at government hospitals. As many as\n43% of the respondents faced renewal problems and 32% said that they had\nencountered  procedural  problems  while  obtaining  the  yellow  card.  The\noverwhelming majority of the respondents, 84%, were illiterate. As a result,\n37% of the respondents were not aware of the procedure for getting a yellow\ncard and 31% did not apply to get one. While applying for a yellow card,\n77% respondents had loan benefits in mind and only 7% were aware of the\nhealth benefits.\n\nOf those who were aware of the user-fee benefits of the yellow card in\ngovernment  hospitals,  only  8%  used  this  facility.  X-rays,  medicines,  and\ntreatment were made available to them at concessional rates or free of charge.\nBut even with the benefits, the out-of-pocket expenses were quite high, at\naround Rs500 per case on average.\n\nGetting  health-care  benefits  with  the  yellow  cards  is  not  easy.  About\n10%  of  the  respondents  found  it  difficult  to  get  yellow-card  benefits  at\ngovernment hospitals. The hospital staff were uncooperative and insensitive.\nThe waiting list was long, so the card holders had to visit repeatedly to get the\nbenefits.  Others were told to pay for the services instead.\n\nLack of adequate health services from the government compels the poor\nto depend mainly on their own resources for health care. On average, poor\nhouseholds spend Rs428 per month on health care, or about 25% of their\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n627\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\f628\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nmean household income (Rs1,730). Among poor families the elderly suffer\nmost from the lack of resources for health care. All survey respondents said\nthat  old  people  had  to  make  a  sacrifice  because  of  low  income.  Children,\nfollowed  by  young  people,  get  preference  in  health-care  expenditure.\nInterestingly enough, among the poor there is no gender bias in getting medical\ntreatment for family members.\n\nIn the absence of adequate opportunities from the government for health\ncare, the poor in Punjab depend largely on the unorganized private sector\n(Gupta  2002).  About  90%  of  the  respondents  preferred  private  hospitals\nbecause they get proper attention and immediate relief, and so they save time.\nTime saving is the major consideration, as the opportunity cost in the form of\nlost wages is high. But the private sector in Punjab is dominated by quacks.\nEighty-nine percent of the respondents use the services of quacks, traditionally\nknown as dais, for childbirth. Only when the dais cannot handle a case or\ncomplications  develop  are  the  patients  taken  to  the  government  hospitals.\nDais  are  preferred  because  their  services  are  cheaper  and  more  accessible.\nAccording to a recent report, three children died while two other children and\none man were taken seriously ill within minutes of taking medicines given by\nquacks in Ludhiana. Such cases are not uncommon in Punjab (Hindustan\nTimes 2005b).\n\nPrivate Super-specialty Hospitals and the Poor\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the second policy decision was to open up health-\n\ncare services in a major way to the private sector.\n\nUnfortunately, the benefits of this policy decision have not percolated\ndown to the poor. In one very prestigious private hospital, not a single poor\npatient received free treatment, against the targets of 10% for outpatients and\n5% for inpatients. The PUDA so far has not received the required list of poor\npatients from any of the private hospitals in the state. The elite orientation of\nmanagement, lack of awareness among the poor about free treatment in private\nhospitals, and ineffective regulatory mechanisms are the major hindrances to\nfree treatment for the poor in private hospitals.\n\nThe  field  survey  revealed  that  99%  of  the  respondents  had  not  even\nheard about the user-fee benefits of yellow card holders at private super-specialty\nhospitals. Not only were the respondents unaware of any such facility but\nthey simply could not imagine that the private sector, motivated solely by\nprofit, could offer services for free. Only 1% of the respondents had approached\na  private  sector  super-specialty  hospital.  They  said  that  the  staff  were\nnonsupportive because of their profit orientation and added that such hospitals\ndo not pay attention to poor patients.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n628\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\fHealth Care for the Poor in India with Special Reference to Punjab State\n\n629\n\nBut it is not only in Punjab where the poor have not gotten free treatment\nat the super-speciality private hospitals. Two public interest litigations (PILs)\nhave  been  filed  in  Delhi  High  Court  and  in  Bombay  High  Court  against\ncorporate hospitals for not providing free treatment to the poor. According to\nthe PIL in Delhi High Court, the Delhi Development Authority provided\nland at concessional rates to 12 private hospitals, yet none of these hospitals\nprovides free treatment to the deserving poor; but then nor do the 70 others\nin Bombay that have been similarly favored (Thomas 2005, The Tribune 1999).\nOn  the  other  hand,  there  have  been  reported  cases  of  the  nonpoor  being\nclassed as poor and given free treatment (The Tribune 1999). A recent study\nby the Planning Commission also says that the bulk of private health-care\nunits in India are run by doctors and doctor-entrepreneurs and are unregulated\nin  terms  of  adequacy  of  facility  or  competence,  standards  of  quality,  and\naccountability. Also, as a follow-up to the National Health Policy 2002, private\nhospitals were given concessional lands, customs exemption, and liberal tax\nbenefits  against  a  commitment  to  reserve  beds  for  poor  patients  for  free\ntreatment.  Unfortunately,  as  no  procedure  to  monitor  this  exists  and  the\ndisclosure systems are far from transparent, redress of patient grievances is\npoor (Neogi 2005). Adenwalla (2005), while making similar observations,\nnoted: \u201cThe administrators in most private sector hospitals and medical colleges\nare essentially businessmen. They have reduced medical care to the level of an\nindustry. The  poor  man,  unless  he  is  willing  to  incur  enormous  debts,  is\nunceremoniously elbowed out of these institutions\u201d (also see Praveenlal et al.\n2005). The Prime Minister of India, while inaugurating a private sector multi-\nspecialty hospital in Punjab recently, reiterated the Government\u2019s view that\nthe benefits of these institutions must reach the poor (Hindustan Times 2005a).\n\nHealth Insurance and the Poor\n\nHealth insurance is another means of improving the access of the poor\nto health-care services, as was also underlined by the Prime Minister of India\n(Hindustan Times  2005a).  In  India,  public  sector  insurance  companies,\nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), and community-based organizations\noffer  a  host  of  insurance  schemes  for  the  poor. Two  prominent  schemes\nintroduced by public insurance companies are Jan Arogya (an insurance policy\ndesigned  for  the  poor  with  a  view  to  protect  them  from  high  costs  of\nhospitalization) and the Universal Health Insurance Scheme. The NGOs have\naround 26 insurance schemes for the poor. But all these schemes have not\nachieved their objective of helping the poor when they fall sick. For example,\nBennett, Creese, and Monasch (1998), while reviewing the community-based\ninsurance schemes, expressed the view that most of the schemes are poorly\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n629\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\f630\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\ndesigned and mismanaged, and fail to reach the poorest of the poor. Their\nmembership is not widely spread over the poor population, and these schemes\nalso need extensive financial support (World Health Organization 2004). In\nPunjab, health insurance for the poor is in a grim situation. The insurance\ncompanies have not launched any comprehensive awareness and marketing\nstrategies  for  the  schemes,  and  thus  the  poor  fail  to  take  advantage.  For\nexample, the field survey showed that none of the respondents had even\nheard of health insurance policies for the poor, as nobody had told them;\nilliteracy  also  restricted  their  access  to  the  policies. Though  most  of  the\nrespondents showed keen interest in the scheme, they did not know which\nagency to contact or what to do.\n\nConclusion and Policy Implications\n\nIn India, the social sector in general and the health sector in particular\nhave been the loser on account of poor resource allocation during the post-\nliberalization and globalization phase. In the first year of liberalization (1992\u2013\n1993), the combined expenditure of the central and state governments on\nhealth was 1.01% of gross domestic product. This declined to 0.99% in 2003\u2013\n2004. A similar trend was noticeable in Punjab state. The meager allocations\nto the health sector have affected the poorer members of society more.\n\nPunjab  health  policy  has  undergone  two  major  reforms  in  the  post-\nliberalization phase. First, the government set up the Punjab Health Systems\nCorporation  (PHSC)  in  October  1995,  under  the  World  Bank-sponsored\nState Health Systems Development Project II, and transferred more than 150\nhealth-care institutions run by the government to PHSC. To raise resources,\nthe  earlier  practice  of  free  services  was  discarded;  instead  the  user  fee  was\napplied to all patients except for a few categories, including people below the\npoverty  line. The  second  major  reform  was  the  opening  up  of  health-care\nservices to the private sector. Under this policy, private sector hospitals get\nland and facilities at subsidized rates from the government in return for free\ntreatment for yellow card holders.\n\nThe  data  gathered  from  both  secondary  and  primary  sources  suggest\nthat the promised free treatment for the poor has not materialized. Two main\nfactors\u2014lack of awareness of the benefit among the poor and the bureaucratic\nprocedures involved in getting and renewing the yellow cards\u2014are holding\nback the poor from access to free health-care services.\n\nWithout  adequate  access  to  government  hospitals,  the  poor  depend\nmainly on the unorganized private sector for health care, a sector unfortunately\ndominated  by  untrained  doctors  or  quacks. The  poor,  as  a  result,  have  to\nspend around one fourth of their income on health care.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n630\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\fHealth Care for the Poor in India with Special Reference to Punjab State\n\n631\n\nThe benefits of super-specialty hospitals have not reached the poor at\nall. Factors such as the elite orientation of management, the lack of awareness\namong the poor about free treatment, and ineffective regulatory mechanisms\nare the major stumbling blocks.\n\nThe government and NGOs have announced many health insurance\npolicies for the poor. Here the outcome is again unsatisfactory. Poor design\nand management of the policies, narrow coverage, and inadequacy of funds\nexplain the unsatisfactory progress of insurance policies for the poor.\n\nOn the basis of this analysis, the study suggests the following ways of\nimproving the access of the poor to health-care services in India in general\nand in Punjab in particular.\n\nFirst, the national and state governments should allocate more resources\nto health care and achieve the target of 6% set by the National Health Policy\n2002. Further, within the health sector, allocations for primary health care\nshould progressively increase, as the poor are the major beneficiaries of primary\nhealth care services.\n\nSecond, the government and NGOs should launch a campaign to make\nthe  poor  more  aware  of  the  exemption  from  user  charges  in  government\nhospitals and super-specialty private hospitals. The government should make\nit mandatory for both public and private hospitals to prominently display  on\ntheir premises information on the exemption.\n\nThird, the procedure for getting and renewing the yellow card should be\nsimplified  and  made  more  transparent  and  time-bound.  In  the  light  of\ndecentralization initiatives (the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments)\nto empower rural and urban locally elected bodies, the authority to issue yellow\ncards should be transferred to local governments.\n\nFourth, the government should make it mandatory for super-specialty\nhospitals to meet their targets for poor patients. The hospitals should regularly\nsubmit data regarding poor patients served to PUDA, and if they fail to do\nthat, they should be heavily penalized.\n\nFifth, the poor should be widely informed through locally elected bodies\nand civil society organizations about the health insurance plans for them. The\nparticipation of the poor in the design, management, and implementation of\nsuch plans should be solicited.\n\nSixth,  to  make  the  delivery  of  health-care  services  pro-poor,  a  more\nvigilant,  transparent,  and  regulatory  regime  is  all  the  more  necessary.\nInformation about the regulatory authorities, particularly the nodal officer\u2019s\nname and phone number, should be displayed prominently in each hospital,\nso that the poor patients can easily contact the officer if the hospital refuses to\nserve them.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n631\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\f632\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nReferences\n\nAdenwalla,  H.

Khawaja1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe  development  of  the  social  sector  of  Pakistan  in  general,  and  the\nhealth sector in particular, has lagged behind and has not gotten the priority it\ndeserves. As a result, the country\u2019s Human Development Index is abysmal.\nThe 2004 Human Development Report of the United Nations Development\nProgramme places Pakistan with nine others at the lowest level of development.\nThe  living  standard  of  the  poor  has  declined  steadily  over  the  years,\nwhile the gap between the rich and the poor has significantly widened. More\nthan a third of the population lives below the poverty line. Overcrowding,\nimproper ventilation, and poor sanitation make the poor vulnerable to various\ninfectious  diseases.  Chilling  stories  of  deaths  due  to  slow  starvation  and\nmalnutrition  have  become  routine.  According  to  the  United  Nations\nPopulation Fund, Pakistan\u2019s maternal mortality rate is 300\u2013700 per 100,000\nlive births, partly because 80% of the 4.5 million births yearly occur at home.\nThe Pakistan report (2003) of the United Nations Children\u2019s Education Fund\nsuggests an infant mortality rate of 82 per 1,000 live births\u2014the second highest\nin South Asia. A major reason for this poor performance is the Government\u2019s\nlow spending on health. In 2004-2005, Pakistan spent only 0.6% of its gross\ndevelopment product (GDP) on the sector (Pakistan Economic Survey, 2005,\nGovernment of Pakistan, page 151).\n\nThis paper analyzes the issues facing the health sector of Pakistan and\nlooks  into  the  possibility  of  achieving  the  mid-decade  Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) for the country by 2015.\n\nHealth-care Facilities in Pakistan\n\nThere is a Ministry of Health at the federal level and health departments\nat provincial levels. The Ministry of Health supervises the overall health delivery\nsystem of the country sets health sector policies and reforms. It also has a vast\nnetwork of hospitals all over the country. However, the major responsibility\nfor providing health services to the general public rests with the provincial\nhealth departments.\n\n1 Chief Instructor/Professor, Civil Services Academy, Walton, Lahore, Pakistan.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n634\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\fHealth Care for the Poor and the Millennium Development Goals: A Case Study of Pakistan\n\n635\n\nThe public health delivery system has three tiers: (i) primary health-care\nfacilities, comprising basic health units and rural health centers; (ii) secondary\nhealth-care facilities, made up of tehsil (subdistrict) and district headquarters\nhospitals; and (iii) tertiary health-care facilities (teaching hospitals).\n\nPrimary Health-care Facilities\n\nBasic Health Units (BHUs). The BHU, with two labor beds and outdoor\ndispensing facilities, is the health-care facility provided at the level of the union\ncouncil,  the  smallest  administrative  unit  (population:  4,000\u20138,000). The\nMinistry of Health has made efforts to see that all union councils have at least\none BHU each, providing basic curative, preventive, and supportive services.\nThe BHU is staffed with a doctor, a male health technician, a female health\ntechnician,  a  lady  health  visitor,  and  other  support  staff.  Every  BHU  also\nsupervises the activities of 20 outreach lady health workers (LHWs). From 20\nto 40  patients visit a BHU a day, on average.\n\nRural Health Centers (RHCs). The RHC is a better-equipped facility\nat the town committee level in the districts and has 20\u201330 beds. It provides\ninpatient and outpatient curative and preventive health services to a population\nof 20,000\u201340,000. The RHC is staffed with four to six male doctors and one\nor two lady doctors, plus technical and support staff, both male and female.\nEach RHC is a small colony consisting of the main building and residences\nfor the medical officers and LHWs to ensure that they are available throughout\nthe day.\n\nSecondary Health-care Facilities\n\nTehsil Headquarters Hospitals (THQs). Each THQ has 50\u201360 beds.\n\nThe services the THQs provide differ from place to place.\n\nDistrict Headquarters Hospitals (DHQs). Each DHQ has 100 or more\nbeds  and  provides  secondary  health-care  services  to  a  population  of  more\nthan two million.\n\nTertiary Health-care Facilities (Teaching Hospitals)\n\nAt the highest level of the public health delivery system are these hospitals,\nsituated in relatively larger cities. They offer extensive health facilities in several\nmedical fields and are normally also attached to a medical college.\n\nThe present vision and strategy for the health sector of Pakistan is built\non  (i)  the  Health  for  All  (HFA)  principle;  (ii)  accessible,  acceptable,  and\naffordable service delivery; (iii) efficient, equitable, and effective health care;\nand (iv) preventive and promotive health care.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n635\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\f636\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nShortcomings of the Health System\n\nThrough the network of primary health-care facilities, free treatment is\nprovided  to  patients.  But  owing  to  inadequate  laboratory  equipment  and\nmedical staff, these government-owned health facilities and hospitals fail to\nprovide  adequate  health  care.  Furthermore,  most  health  practitioners  are\nemployed in public health facilities during the morning and practice privately\nin the evening. Most physicians in the basic health units are fresh graduates\nfrom the medical schools. (See Table 1 for a summary of health personnel\nnumbers.) The allocation to the health sector is less than 1% of gross domestic\nproduct (GDP), but the distribution of financial resources is an even more\nserious problem, as can be seen from Table 2.\n\nEfforts to contain infectious diseases are mostly in vain because of poor\nfinancial accountability, the scarcity of skilled manpower, inaccessibility, and\nother factors. Technical difficulties in the supply of medicines, such as the\nfailure to maintain the cold chain in the case of the polio vaccine, are just as\nimportant. Polio cases are still found in the country despite the multiple mass\ncampaigns. Pakistan has also been running a tuberculosis control program for\nthe last decade and a half without achieving much.\n\nTable 1: Health Personnel\n\nCategory\n\n2002\u20132003\n\n2003\u20132004\n\n2004\u20132005\n\nRegistered doctors\nRegistered dentists\nRegistered nurses\nPopulation per doctor\nPopulation per dentist\nPopulation per nurse\n\n101,635\n5,068\n44,520\n1,466\n29,402\n3,347\n\n108,062\n5,530\n46,331\n1,404\n27,414\n3,296\n\nSource: Pakistan Economic Survey 2005; Government of Pakistan, page 150.\n\n113,206\n6,127\n48,446\n1,359\n25,107\n3,175\n\nTable 2: Population Served and Share of Health Expenditure\n\nService\n\nPopulation Served\n\nShare of Expenditure\n\nPrimary health care\nSecondary health care\nTertiary health care\n\nSource: Ministry of Health.\n\n90%\n 9%\n 1%\n\n15%\n45%\n40%\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n636\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\fHealth Care for the Poor and the Millennium Development Goals: A Case Study of Pakistan\n\n637\n\nState-run hospitals are tremendously overstretched and their standards\nare getting worse by the day. Primary health-care facilities are often without a\ndoctor,  so  that  patients  are  left  to  the  care  of  paramedics  or  even  peons.\nInsufficient funds and flagging management contribute in large measure to\nthe failure of these facilities. The quality and delivery of services is likewise\nnegligible at the secondary level of health care. At the tertiary level, care is well\nstructured in the private sector but not accessible to more than 80% of the\npopulation. Tertiary care in the public sector is clogged. Lacking trust and\nconfidence in primary and secondary level care, the masses move to the tertiary\nlevel if the facilities are accessible.\n\nDespite the recent proliferation of medical colleges, there is still a shortage\nof doctors. There is at present a huge imbalance in the doctor-patient ratio.\nDoctors are reluctant to serve in remote areas because of insecurity and lack of\nprofessional growth. This, in turn, has bred quackery. According to one survey,\n600,000 quacks are practicing illegally in the country.\n\nThe World  Bank  argues  that  poor  health  is  largely  a  consequence  of\npoverty, reflecting low income, poor sanitation, inadequate water supplies,\nand  low  level  of  education  especially  among  women.  But  poor  health  in\nPakistan  is  also  indicative  of  major  shortcomings  in  its  health  policy,  and\nparticularly denotes a failure to design and deliver the kind of health care that\ncould be cost-effective, besides improving the health of most of the population.\nHealth policies and program in Pakistan have often set ambitious health targets\nwithout adequate concern for the distributional aspect of health.\n\nPolicy Measures\n\nTo  provide  acceptable,  accessible,  and  affordable  health  care,  it  is\nimportant to (i) promote the primary health care approach in the light of the\nglobal HFA strategy, (ii) improve the quality of health care in both rural and\nurban  areas,  (iii)  encourage  community  and  private  sector  involvement  in\nhealth-care delivery, (iv) evolve and initiate a strong district health system,\nand (v) reduce or eliminate the use of narcotics and psychotropic drugs.\n\nShort-term Policies\n\nThese will include the following:\n\n(cid:127) Reorganizing district health offices to make them more community-\n\nbased and locally managed;\n\n(cid:127) Consolidating  the  primary  health-care  network  in  rural  areas,\nachieving  the  functional  integration  of  the  vertical  program,  and\nmaking structural adjustments;\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n637\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\f638\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nPromoting child spacing as a component of reproductive health services;\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\nImproving hospital administration and financial management;\n(cid:127) Establishing a properly regulated private health sector and protecting\n\ncommunities against quackery;\n\n(cid:127) Evolving a policy for making good-quality drugs available at affordable\n\nprices; and\n\n(cid:127) Reviving traditional medicine and the quality control center at the\n\nNational Institute of Health (NIH).\n\nLong-term Policies\n\nwill be taken over the long term:\n\nIn addition to continuing the above policy measures, the following steps\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\nStreamlining the role of the federal and provincial governments to\ngive  more  responsibility  for  health  delivery  implementation  to\nprovincial governments;\n\n(cid:127) Recovering the cost of services rendered and subsidizing services to\n\nthe poor segment of vulnerable population through zakat;2\n\n(cid:127) Encouraging public-private partnership in health with nongovernment\n\norganizations (NGOs), local bodies, and the private sector;\nImproving services and making them more efficient through good\ngovernance;\n\n(cid:127) Making continued efforts to achieve self-sufficiency in vaccine and\n\ndrug production;\n\n(cid:127) Eliminating malnutrition of all kinds among vulnerable groups; and\n(cid:127) Creating a drug-free society.\n\nImprovements in Equity, Efficiency, and Effectiveness\n\nAt present, the provision of health services is inequitable and inadequate,\ninefficient, and ineffective. The long-term strategies will address the issue of\nequity  by  establishing  primary  health  outlets  in  the  public  sector  only  for\nunserved and underserved populations and areas, involving NGOs, removing\ngender imbalance, and developing public-private partnerships in service delivery.\nThe long-term health sector strategies will address the issue of efficiency\nby improving the social environment and management capacity, controlling\nmalpractice at all levels, enforcing accountability, decentralizing, recovering\ncosts, maximizing the role of the private sector, reducing waste, and following\na health sector reform agenda.\n\n2\n\nIt is incumbent on every Muslim to give 2.5% charity on amount of gold kept for more than a year.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n638\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\fHealth Care for the Poor and the Millennium Development Goals: A Case Study of Pakistan\n\n639\n\nThe long-term health strategies will address the effectiveness issue by\navoiding expansion, focusing on consolidation, linking primary health care\nwith other components of the health sector, ensuring the availability of good-\nquality  drugs  at  affordable  prices,  regulating  the  private  sector,  checking\nquackery, involving and empowering the community and NGOs/community-\nbased  organizations,  and  strengthening  preventive  and  promotive  health\nservices through health and nutrition education.\n\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs)\n\nThe Millennium Summit 2000 convened by the United Nations is a\nlandmark in the history of this global organization.

In the urban areas, health\ncenters will be established to cover the underserved population.\n\nTo address the issue of accessibility of health-care services to vulnerable\nsectors of the society, the Women Health Project, which is being implemented,\nwill be replicated in the rest of the districts.\n\nMedical staff at all levels will be trained and retrained through further\nsupport for the provincial and district human development centers established\nunder health-care and family health projects.\n\nHealth sector reforms will deal with service cost recovery, subsidization\nfor the poor segments of the target population, and regulation of the private\nsector.\n\nPublic-private partnerships will be instituted in the health sector through\nthe privatization of unutilized and underutilized health facilities up to the\nsecondary health-care level.\n\nAutonomy will be given to teaching hospitals, and health boards and\n\nvillage health committees will be established.\n\nThe program of tuberculosis and malaria control\u2014with the new strategies\nof directly observed treatment short course for tuberculosis and the Roll Back\nMalaria  global  partnership\u2014will  greatly  help  to  deal  with  reemerging\ncommunicable diseases affecting mainly the reproductive age group.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe failure of successive national governments in Pakistan to develop a\ncompact and comprehensive health policy is due to various factors. Other\nthan  the  fragmented  urban  health  services  and  problems  related  to  public\nexpenditure, these factors also include issues related to development projects\nlike  overlapping;  gaps  in  planning  and  implementation;  vertical  program;\ndependency of provinces on the federal Government for funding, which delays\nthe projects; planning problems; lack of regulation of the private sector; the\nissue of service accessibility; and poor community involvement.\n\nThe analytical review by Dr. Talib Lashari of different health policies in\nPakistan leads to the conclusion that these initiatives were nothing more than\nGovernment\u2019s attempts to institutionalize and regularize the drafting of policies.\nDeploring  the  irrationality  of  decision  making  regarding  health  policy  in\nPakistan, Lashari (2004) writes: \u201cThis is due to three reasons: Health does not\nget priority in [the] overall decision-making process[;] health expenditures\nhardly differ from [the] previous budget; within the health sector, there is no\nproper use of minimal resources[;] and...decision making takes place in [an]\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n640\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\fHealth Care for the Poor and the Millennium Development Goals: A Case Study of Pakistan\n\n641\n\nisolated manner without including all stakeholders[,] i.e.[,] legislatures and\ncivil society[,] etc.\u201d\n\nLack of continuity of policies, lack of community participation, lack of\ngovernment initiatives to bring the private health sector into the mainstream\nof health care, lack of good governance, and lack of the necessary skills and\ninterest on the part of some stakeholders including public representatives and\nNGOs are some of the other negative factors.\n\nThe role of civil society organizations is very important in this regard.\nThey can be very helpful to policy makers through their policy-related research\nand advocacy. Private sector resources can also be used to bring about a positive\nchange in the health sector. But the private sector needs to be regulated so\nthat the irrational use of drugs and other ills can be eliminated.\n\nWith  the  present  low  level  of  investment  in  the  health  sector,  weak\nimplementation, and poor accountability and monitoring, achieving the MDG\ntargets within the given time frame would be an uphill task.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe  first  step,  which  urgently  needs  to  be  taken,  is  to  change  the\ntraditional governmental perception of health. No development is possible\nwithout improving the health of a country. Development also depends on\nimprovements in economic, political, and social conditions.\n\nAll these require better planning of human resources for health by (i)\nidentifying shortages and surpluses of specific groups of health workers, (ii)\ndefining  the  necessary  core  skills  and  competencies  of  categories  of  health\npersonnel,  (iii)  identifying  the  training  needs  of  health  workers  and  using\nappropriate training methodologies, (iv) analyzing subsequent absorption and\nretention in the public and private sectors, and (v) instituting appropriate\nregulation.\n\nHuman resources are central to managing and delivering health services\nand to meeting the MDGs and other health targets. Given the diversity of\nhealth workers and their skills and experience, defining and classifying these\nhuman resources precisely can help policy makers and planners better appreciate\nthe importance of health personnel. The development of human resources at\nall levels of health care must inevitably be a top priority. The medical education\nsystem  should  be  allowed  to  develop  in  a  decentralized  manner.  The\ndevelopment of local talent base should be undertaken as a top priority, and\nencouraged. It is a tedious and lengthy process, which cannot be cut short.\n\nThe level of investment in the health sector must increase: it should be\nno less than 2% of GDP to start with. Strategies must also be implemented\nwell.

Bautista1\n\nIntroduction\n\nPoverty is a persistent problem in the Philippines. While incidence has\ndeclined from 49.2% in 1985 to 39.5% in 2000, according to the National\nStatistical Coordination Board (cited in Reyes 2003, pages 10\u201311), the poor\nhave increased in number over time, from 26.7 million in 1985 to 30.8 million\nin 2000. This increase can be attributed to the high population growth rate in\nthe Philippines, which was 2.36 from 1995 to 2000 (Reyes 2003, page 5).\nThere are also regional disparities in poverty. In some regions in Mindanao\nand the Visayas, more than 40% of the population is poor\u2014in the Autonomous\nRegion of Muslim Mindanao, where the proportion is highest, the poor make\nup  71.3%  of  the  population\u2014while  in  most  regions  in  Luzon,  except  the\nBicol region, the poor make up less than 40%.\n\nThe governance of public health should be of interest to Filipinos, especially\nthe  poor,  who  rely  on  this  system  for  their  needs.  Public  health  services  are\ngenerally cheaper, if not available for free. The reliance of the poor on public\nhealth facilities is borne out by studies on the use of these facilities, such as the\nones done for the National Demographic Survey of 2003 and the Social Weather\nStation study for the World Bank in 2001 (cited in Olarte and Chua 2005).\n\nPublic health is normally concerned with \u201cthreats to the overall health of a\ncommunity\u2026[and] includes surveillance and control of infectious disease and\npromotion  of  healthy  behaviors  among  members  of  the  community\u201d\n(www.answers.com/topic/public-health).  Doctors,  on  the  other  hand,  treat\npatients one-on-one for a specific disease or injury (www.answers.com/topic/\npublic-health). Thus, public health involves not only the curative aspect of health\nfor the entire community but also the promotion and prevention of diseases.\n\nIn this context, this paper discusses two key topics:\n\n(cid:127) What  are  the  opportunities  in  public  health  governance  in  local\n\ngovernment units (LGUs)?\n\n(cid:127) What still needs to be improved (challenges)?\n\n1 Vice-Chancellor for Academic Affairs, University of the Philippines Open University and Professor\nof the National College of Public Admininistration and Governance, University of the Philippines.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n644\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\fOpportunities and Challenges in the Local Governance of Public Health\n\n645\n\nOpportunities\n\nDevolution\n\nDevolution is one of the opportunities in public health. For one thing,\ndevolution gives local executives and implementers a direct hand in designing\nrelevant projects and approaches according to the needs of their constituents.\nThis mode of management veers away from the traditional way of having\nnational planners and implementers design program and project packages for\nlocal government units, which may not suit the conditions in some localities.\nDevolution also allows local executives and implementers to use resources\nthat are indigenous to the locality, and to boost local capacities and energies\nin the process. Local knowledge, which has given rise to the application of\nsome herbal medicines to treat ailments, could be harnessed to generate local\nenterprise and improve the local economy.\n\nThen, of course, transferring decision making in health matters to local\ngovernment enables the citizenry to see firsthand how decisions are made, to\nexpress their needs and concerns, and, more importantly, to be more actively\ninvolved  in  analysis,  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  and\nevaluation. For participatory governance, development programs can be placed\nunder the jurisdiction of local chief executives (LCEs), who have direct access\nto the people, instead of having decisions made chiefly by national decision\nmakers and their regional counterparts.\n\nThe Local Government Code of 1991 made the maintenance of barangay\nhealth centers a key responsibility of the lowest level of the local government\nunit, the barangay. At the municipal level, the responsibility for health services\nincludes the implementation of programs and projects in primary health care,\nmaternal and child care, and control of communicable and non-communicable\ndiseases, besides secondary and tertiary health-care services. Municipal health\nfacilities  also  attend  to  the  purchase  of  medicines,  medical  supplies,  and\nequipment to carry out the services. Provincial health facilities provide health\nservices in hospitals and tertiary health services.\n\nThese services are to be funded from the share of the local government\nunit in the proceeds of national taxes and other local revenues, and receive\nfunding support from the national Government and its instrumentalities, and\ngovernment-owned and -controlled corporations.\n\nVolunteerism\n\nOne of the most significant contributions of advocacy for primary health\ncare  (PHC)  is  motivating  community  health  volunteers.  Barangay  health\nworkers  (BHWs)  have  emerged  as  partners  of  government  health  workers\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n645\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\f646\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nsince the early 1980s. They are in the frontline of the referral system chain,\nfirst-aid provision, community mobilization in public health projects, and the\nhealth  information  campaign.  Even  after  devolution,  we  see  vibrant\nvolunteerism among BHWs. In fact, BHWs are active not only in public health\nbut also in many community development projects. They gather information\non local poverty indicators for the nationwide monitoring of the quality of\nsuch as in the communities. They take an active part as well in poverty programs\nlike the Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of Social Services (CIDSS),\nwhich was led by the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD)\nuntil 2004, and the foreign-funded Kapit-Bisig Laban sa Kahirapan (\u201cshared\nfight against poverty\u201d)\u2013CIDSS (KALAHI-CIDSS) project of the DSWD.\n\nBHWs are also a very visible part of community-based health programs\nmanaged  by  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  as  Plan  International\nPhilippines, which supports community-managed health programs, and World\nVision,  through  its  advocacy  advocacy  program  against  tuberculosis  called\nKusog Baga (\u201cstrong lungs\u201d) Program.\n\nThe federations of BHWs around the country could be channels for\n\nsocial mobilization and advocacy.\n\nThe legacy of the Department of Health (DOH) in steering volunteerism\nin the community is still felt and seen today. If properly steered, the volunteers\ncan be a significant force in public health advocacy and serve as key mobilizers\nin harnessing community participation in decision making.\n\nBasic Needs Approach\n\nThe  basic  needs  approach  to  assessing  the  quality  of  life,  and  even\nmeasuring poverty, is a comparative advantage for public health. It is a useful\nplanning tool in determining which services should be prioritized, and which\nindividuals  and  families  should  be  given  priority  attention.  Basic  needs\nindicators have already been institutionalized in the Social Reform and Poverty\nAlleviation Act (Republic Act 8425) passed in December 1997. The indicators\nwere advocated and implemented in national programs like the CIDSS.\n\nThe Local Poverty Reduction Action Agenda (LPRAA), drawn up by\nlocal government units at the prompting of the Department of the Interior\nand Local Government (DILG) applies a modified version of the basic needs\nindicators. The indicators have been reduced to 14 (with six of these related\nto health) from the original 33 indicators (the Minimum Basic Needs [MBN]).\nLGU advocacy of these indicators called the Core Local Poverty Indicators\nreinforces the local mandate for health embodied in the Local Government\nCode. These  indicators  set  the  parameters  for  allocating  resources  and  for\ndetermining the progress made by different LGUs.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n646\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\fOpportunities and Challenges in the Local Governance of Public Health\n\n647\n\nAn improvement in the new set of indicators is their focus on impact\nconcerns rather than a combination of inputs, outputs, and impact (the concern\nof the set of 33 indicators). The 14 indicators also focus on individual household\nmembers and not on the household (the unit of analysis in the original set of\nindicators). The MBN and Core Local Poverty Indicators sets of indicators\nare compared in Appendix A.\n\nHowever, both sets of indicators highlight the importance of enabling\nmembers of the community to identify the programs that respond to their\nneeds, rather than providing them with packaged services.\n\nLocal Empowerment\n\nAn  important  feature  of  LPRAA  is  the  recognition  of  people\u2019s\norganizations as participants in decision making. In the Guidebook on Local\nDiagnosis and Planning prepared by the DILG, the National Economic and\nDevelopment  Authority  (NEDA),  National  Anti-Poverty  Commission\n(NAPC),  and  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),\nrepresentatives of the basic sectors (farmers, fisherfolk, women, children, youth,\nsenior citizens, persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples, informal labor,\nformal labor, urban poor, victims of calamities, cooperatives, and NGOs),\nmostly  from  the  marginalized  groups,    are  expected  to  be  included  in  the\nLocal Poverty Reduction Action Team (DILG, NEDA, NAPC, and UNDP\n2002). In effect, this directive reinforces the participatory approach to health\nmanagement consistent with PHC, a devolved responsibility under the 1991\nLocal Government Code. The advantage of planning with a poverty reduction\nfocus is its holistic view of development, which the PHC approach underscores.\nIn addition, NGOs and people\u2019s organizations can participate in local\nplanning,  with  their  representatives  composing  at  least  one  fourth  of  the\nplanning bodies.\n\nRole of LGUs in National and Foreign-funded Programs\n\nMany  national  and  foreign-funded  programs  or  projects  in  health\nrecognize the need to work in tandem with local government. The CIDSS\nand the KALAHI-CIDSS programs in poverty alleviation are national programs\nthat engage the participation of local chief executives, who will ultimately\nhave to commit their resources and people to these projects. In the case of the\nKALAHI-CDSS project, municipal officials chair inter-barangay forums to\nevaluate proposals for funding support from the World Bank, with counterpart\nfunding from the local government unit. The inter-barangay forums also set\nthe criteria for assigning priority to proposals from the different barangays.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n647\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\f648\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nThe  forums  are  composed  of  representatives  from  the  national  and  local\ngovernment units in social development, people\u2019s organizations, NGOs, and\nthe basic sectors.\n\nThe  foreign-funded  project  Family  Health  by  and  for  Poor  Settlers,\nfunded by German technical cooperation (GTZ), on the other hand, mobilizes\nLGUs to help improve family health self-management activities and the use\nof family and reproductive health services by target groups; to organize and\nsupport community centers for family health; and to develop family health\nworkers (DOH 2001a).\n\nWorking together with LGUs ensures transfer of technology and, hence,\nlocal ownership and program sustainability after the phaseout of the national\nand internal interventions.\n\nCommunity-based  Approach  and  Integrated  Planning  in  National\nand Foreign-funded Projects\n\nMany national and foreign-funded projects operating in different LGUs\nare committed to mobilizing communities to empower them, as well as to\npartnering with other civil society groups, especially NGOs. They also strive\nto  take  a  multidimensional  view  to  development,  where  health  is  often  a\nconcern.\n\nFor instance, UNDP, with P14 million in grants, supports the promotion\nof  a  multi-sectoral  and  community-based  approach  to  HIV  prevention  in\nurban  areas  in  the  National  Capital  Region,  Region  IV,  Cordillera\nAdministrative Region, and Region VI (DOH 2001).\n\nThe  Canadian  International  Agency  for  International  Development\n(CIDA)  has  also  extended  a  grant  of  P1.234  billion  for  community\nmobilization to reduce the incidence of tuberculosis in areas in four regions\ncovered by the previous community-based program of World Vision (DOH\nWeb site 2005).\n\nA P49.882 billion grant from the Australian Agency for International\nDevelopment supports the implementation and evaluation of self-sustaining\ncommunity-based  projects  in  malaria  eradication. This  entails  mobilizing\nvolunteers,  setting  up  health  insurance,  conducting  health  education,  and\nsetting up surveillance systems (DOH Web site 2005).\n\nThus,  of  the  36  foreign-funded  projects  listed  by  DOH  Bureau  of\nInternational Health Cooperation in 2001 (DOH Web site 2005), 13 have\ncommunity mobilization at the top of their agenda and, hence, conform to\nthe PHC mandate.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n648\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\fOpportunities and Challenges in the Local Governance of Public Health\n\n649\n\nLocal Innovations Recognized by Award-giving Bodies\n\nAward-giving bodies have recognized innovative approaches and strategies\nin governance in LGUs. An award specific to local health development is the\nSentrong Sigla (\u201chealth center\u201d) seal  that the DOH gives to LGUs that meet\nhealth-care  quality  standards  and  comply  with  indicators  pertinent  to  the\nphysical and human resources available in their facility. The standards pertain\nto  infrastructure  and  amenities,  services,  attitudes  and  behavior  of  health\nworkers,  human  resources,  equipment,  medicines  and  supplies,  health\ninformation system, and community intervention (Bautista, Legaspi, et al.\n2002, page 32). These standards have been improved lately to incorporate\nnot only input indicators but also process and outcome indicators. Sentrong\nSigla LGUs receive monetary rewards by DOH for their use in their operations\n(interview with DOH technical staff, 6 June 2003).\n\nThe  Galing  Pook  (\u201cexcellent  place\u201d)  Foundation,  started  in  1993,  is\nconsidered a pioneering program that recognizes innovation and excellence in\nlocal governance in the Philippines. From 1994 to 2004, Galing Pook annual\nawards went to 195 outstanding local governance programs, which are now\nmodels of effective local governance (Galing Pook Web site  2005). This award\nsystem  is  part  of  an  international  network  of  local  governance  award\nmechanisms  in  eight  countries  (Brazil,  Chile,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,\nMexico, Peru, Philippines, South Africa, and United States) assisted by Ford\nFoundation  (Rodriguez  2002).  Innovations  in  governance  with  direct  or\nindirect implications for health care are evident among the roster of winners.\nIn 2002, 5 of the 10 awards went to the health sector, the highest number\nregistered so far. The health awardees all subscribed to participatory governance,\naccording to the PHC approach (Galing Pook Foundation 2002).\n\nOne of the recipients of a Galing Pook health award, a drive participated\nin by people\u2019s organizations and other civil society groups, cleaned up the\ncoastline  of  Bataan  and  helped  prevent  diseases.  A  constituent-responsive\nprogram  in  Bulacan,  which  applied  the  survey  research  method  to  get\nrepresentative  feedback  from  citizens  on  projects,  led  to  the  setting  up  of\nhealth insurance (Medicare para sa Masa) (\u201cMedicare for the Masses\u201d). Another\ninitiative, this one started by the governor of Davao del Norte Province, used\nbasic needs indicators, including health indicators, as tools in project planning\nand prioritization (Galing Pook Foundation 2002). Also a recent awardee was\nthe inter-LGU-NGO partnership in health-care delivery in the province of\nNegros Oriental, where hospital boards capitalized on partnerships between\nstakeholders outside government to devise creative ways of addressing concerns\nin  health-care  delivery.  Health  zones  were  formed  to  devolve  program\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n649\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\f650\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nmanagement further to the districts, a level of administration between the\nprovinces and the municipalities.\n\nAll these award systems motivate LGUs to innovate in governance for\n\nlocal development.\n\nInternational Commitments Reinforcing Health Priorities\n\nAnother opportunity is the commitment of global networks to prioritize\nhealth. For instance, the 20-20 agreement is a commitment that grew out of\nthe World Summit for Social Development. It stipulates the allocation of 20%\nof government resources to so-called human priority expenditures to attain\ndecent  levels  of  human  development.  Official  development  assistance  will\nallocate another 20%. The expenditures are mainly for PHC\u2014reproductive\nhealth, basic nutrition, low-cost water supply, and sanitation. The others go to\nbasic education, early child care, and basic social welfare.\n\nThe  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  reinforced  the  20-20\ninitiative which were passed at a Special Session of the United Nations General\nAssembly in September 2000. Four out of the 10 goals pertain to health, with\nquantitative targets up to the year 2015 for use in assessing if the goals have\nbeen achieved. Corresponding programs of action to address each goal have\nbeen incorporated by the Philippines in its Medium-Term Development Plan.\nThe four health-related goals are (United Nations 2000, Manasan 2002):\n\n(cid:127) Two-thirds  reduction  in  child  mortality  (among  children  under  5\n\n(cid:127)\n\nyears old);\nImprovements  in  maternal  health,  as  indicated  by  a  three-fourths\nreduction in maternal mortality;\n\n(cid:127) Control  of  HIV/AIDS,  malaria,  and  other  diseases  through  the\n\nprevention or reversal of their spread; and\n\n(cid:127) Environmental sustainability, as indicated by a 50% reduction in the\nproportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water,\nand the integration of the principles of sustainable development into\ncountry policies and programs to reverse the loss of environmental\nresources.\n\nThe  institutionalization  of  these  goals  in  the  Philippines  steered  the\nadoption of the Local Poverty Indicator Monitoring System by some LGUs to\nassess the extent of attainment of the MDGs. This was reported by DILG\nAssistant Secretary Austere Panadero (2005), citing the experience of Pasay\nCity and the provinces of Camiguin, Marinduque, and Masbate.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n650\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\fOpportunities and Challenges in the Local Governance of Public Health\n\n651\n\nChallenges\n\nRole of Local Chief Executives (LCEs)\n\nThe most critical challenge in public health is obtaining the commitment\nof LCEs. While public health is a devolved responsibility, this is no assurance\nthat the local executives fully understand the responsibility or will commit to\nit. Most problematic is local appreciation of the meaning of PHC, since the\nconcept is not well defined even in the implementing rules and regulations of\nthe Local Government Code. Hence, traditional curative health, and not health\npromotion and prevention (and even less the mobilization of communities\nand people in governance), is how these executives normally perceive their\nresponsibility..\n\nThe most difficult challenge for public health workers is the 3-year term\nof local executives, since a change in political leadership could also mean a\nchange  in  commitment  and  investments  in  health.  Continuity  of  projects\ncould be a problem, especially if the new executives are bent on making their\nmark through a change in administrative focus. Each change in administration\nnecessitates advocacy and orientation for the new leaders.\n\nThe DILG and local universities can be allies in an orientation program\n\nin public health for new LCEs.\n\nCareer Path and Mobility for Public Health Workers\n\nThere is a need to assess how public health workers in LGUs can be\nmotivated, as their career path is not clearly spelled out in the Magna Carta\nfor Health Workers. This fact is considered a key problem by the national\noffice (Bautista 2001, page 13). Unless innovative mechanisms for mobility\nare instituted in LGUs, not knowing how much professional growth is open\nto them could demoralize health workers.\n\nMoreover,  although  the  Magna  Carta  for  Health  Workers  stipulates\nbenefits and incentives for devolved health workers\u2014including hazard pay,\nlaundry allowance, holiday pay, and even remote allowance and medico-legal\nallowance (Olarte and Chua 2005)\u2014many LGUs have reportedly failed to\nfully implement the provisions. Frustrated, the health workers either transfer\nto Manila or go abroad (Olarte and Chua 2005).\n\nNeed to Motivate and Orient BHWs\n\nThere is a need to continuously motivate BHWs to keep abreast of recent\ndevelopments and challenges in health. Devolved health workers have a major\nrole in harnessing, orienting, and motivating BHWs. But political intervention\nis possible, as local officials have the power to determine how much hazard\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n651\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\f652\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nand subsistence pay the BHWs can receive, in accordance with the BHW\nBenefits  and  Incentives  Act  (Republic  Act  7883)  of  15  February  1995.  A\nrecent study on the Directly Observed Treatment Short Course Strategy among\ntubercular patients noted that local chief executives had appointed political\nallies to replace well-trained and knowledgeable BHWs (Bautista and Gervacio\n2003).\n\nNeed for Focused Targeting Technology in Health\n\nIn  training  programs  of  LCEs  conducted  by  the  National  College  of\nPublic Administration and Governance of the University of the Philippines,\nhealth is often a dreaded service because, to them, it is a curative service that\nmust  be  universally  provided.  Public  health  management  should  consider\nfocused targeting technology, as this will enable health workers to determine\nwho should receive priority attention. It is important to have a system that\nseparates those who can afford the service from those who cannot, so that\nhealth services can benefit the most marginalized. Mechanisms for charging\nthose who can afford to pay can be considered in public health systems to\nensure that medicines, immunizations, and laboratory fees are not given to\nthem for free.\n\nThe application of focused targeting technology hinges on the adoption\nof a set of indicators to assess the extent of deprivation. At the moment, only\nselected barangays that had been targeted in poverty alleviation programs have\nimplemented the methodology as a national government priority, besides areas\nwhere LCEs took the initiative to adopt the system.\n\nAdvocacy of the indicators, as the basis for the LPRAA, has to be fast-\n\ntracked to cover more LGUs.\n\nHaving a reliable set of indicators could also be helpful in setting up a\nhealth insurance system, as was discussed recently at a National Conference\nfor  Community-based  Monitoring  Systems  (Angelo  King  Institute  for\nEconomics  and  Business  Studies  of  the  De  La  Salle  University  2005).\nParticipants from the provinces shared the applicability of the indicators in\ntargeting families and individuals that deserve priority attention.\n\nThe Challenge for Community Mobilization\n\nThe extent to which community mobilization is to be undertaken remains\nan  issue. This  devolved  responsibility  has  been  transferred  to  local  health\nworkers. The question is, who assumes this responsibility, and is mobilization\nto be continuous?\n\nIn a study on the impact of Plan International Philippines, an NGO\nthat advocated community-managed health systems, its partner communities\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n652\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\fOpportunities and Challenges in the Local Governance of Public Health\n\n653\n\ndid better in mobilizing people\u2019s participation in governance after advocacy\nby  the  NGO\u2019s  mobilizers  (Bautista,  Nicolas,  et  al.  2004). This  assessment\nshows  the  importance  of  continuous  advocacy  to  institutionalize  the\nparticipatory approach.\n\nFunds for Public Health\n\nOne of the nagging problems affecting the national Government is having\nto service government borrowings made to supplement revenue deficits. Debt\nservice  has  major  implications  for  the  amount  of  money  available  for\ndevelopment projects and directly affects public health. The national budget\nfor social development, including health, has declined from a high of 33.2%\nin 1999 to a low of 29.6% in 2003. Economic services also suffered a decline,\nfrom 24% to 20.2%. On the other hand, debt servicing increased from 18.3%\nto 27.8% in the same period (Briones 2002). By year 2006, the prognosis is\neven worse for social development, estimated to be P27.91% and economic\nservices,  18.72%  (Briones  1996:  2).  This  is  because  debt  servicing  has\nsubstantially increased to 32.28%.\n\nAnother issue is the extent of priority given to public health care. In a\nreport on health spending by Simbulan (2001), it was learned that curative\nservices got the major chunk of the national allocation for 1986\u20132000, as 20\u2013\n73% of the budget went to hospital and regional operations, services, and\nmaintenance. On the other hand, promotive and preventive health care got\nonly 1.3\u201330% (Simbulan 2001, page 60).\n\nGa\u00f1ac and Amoranto (2001, page 23) disclosed that in 1999, 16.8% of\nthe health-care expenditure of DOH went to public health, as against 67.54%\nfor curative services. Also in 1999, in LGUs where basic health services were\ndevolved, Ga\u00f1ac and Amoranto (2001) showed 47.39% going to public health\nwhile curative care got 26.35%. However, the average expenditure per public\nhealth facility was a measly P147,000 as against a whopping P1,720,000 per\nhospital.\n\nHealth-care spending in 1999 was below 5% of gross national product\n(GNP), the standard set by the World Health Organization (WHO), with\nthe Philippines spending 3.4% of GNP (Ga\u00f1ac and Amoranto 2001).\n\nThe current Secretary of Health believes that a budget of P86 billion\n(versus the present P10 billion) is needed to allow the Government to comply\nwith the WHO recommendation (Crisostomo 2005).\n\nPoor Appreciation of Health Insurance\n\nAppreciation for health insurance to date is very low. That leaves the\npoor at the mercy of government health facilities. Per capita expenditure for\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n653\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\f654\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nhealth in 1999 was P1,449, with P70 of that (or 0.5%) coming from social\ninsurance and P549 (or 37.9%) from government. Private spending, to make\nup for the difference, amounted to P829, or 57.2% (NSCB 2001).\n\nThis pattern implies that the financial burden of health on individual\nfamilies remains heavy, leaving access to care highly inequitable (NSCB 2001).\n\nPreventable Diseases Still Prevalent\n\nA raging public health concern is the burden of managing and controlling\ninfectious diseases that can be prevented or avoided. The latest statistical data\nfrom the DOH on leading causes of morbidity for 2001 show that 8 out of 10\nare  preventable  (diarrhea,  bronchitis,  pneumonia,  influenza,  tuberculosis,\nmalaria, measles, and chicken pox) (DOH Web site 2005). The two other\ncauses are hypertension and diseases of the heart. (See Appendix B.)\n\nTwo of the 10 causes of mortality in 1997 (pneumonia and tuberculosis)\nwere preventable (DOH Web site 2005). The other eight causes were diseases\nof the heart, diseases of the vascular system, malignant neoplasms, accidents,\nchronic  obstructive  pulmonary  diseases  and  allied  conditions,  certain\nconditions originating in the perinatal period, diabetes mellitus, and nephritis/\nnephritic syndrome/nephrosis) (DOH Web site 2005) (See Appendix B).\n\nThe fact that preventable disease still exist shows the need to invest more\n\neffort in promotive and preventive health care.\n\nThe health management burden is aggravated by the fact that annual\npopulation  growth  (2.36%  in  1995\u20132000)  is  higher  than  in  neighboring\ncountries (Reyes 2003, citing National Statistics Office data). In 1997, the\npopulation growth rate was 1.9% in Bangladesh, 1.9% in the People\u2019s Republic\nof China, 1.6% in Indonesia, and 0.9% in the Republic of Korea (Government\nof the Philippines and United Nations Fund for Population 1999, page 10).\nThen, of course, new global threats as bird flu have to be dealt with and\n\nare a further drain on local resources.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the whole, these issues and challenges reflect expectations on the\npart of the national and local governments to improve the implementation of\npublic health services.\n\nMore specifically, national and local health offices have a major role to\nplay in continuous advocacy among local government officials to get them to\ncommit  to  the  delivery  of  health  services,  consistent  with  the  needs  and\ndemands of the community, and the principles of the PHC approach. This\nmeans that advocacy must deal not only with health programs but also with\nthe basic principles of participatory governance, which is what PHC is all\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n654\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\fOpportunities and Challenges in the Local Governance of Public Health\n\n655\n\nabout. There  is  therefore  a  need  to  orient  a  new  breed  of  public  health\npractitioners who will also excel in social mobilization, policy advocacy, and\nalliance building, apart from the technical dimension of health. This group\ncan foster partnerships with civil society groups, the private sector, and LGUs\nin devising more urgent solutions to public health problems. Hence, these\npractitioners must have the skills to mobilize the community to participate in\ngovernance.\n\nAn information dissemination network that makes available constantly\nupdated data on the technical aspects of diseases will help prevent outbreaks\nand facilitate public health service planning and implementation.\n\nNational and local health offices should also seize opportunities to use\nexisting technologies for governance, such as local information systems, that\ncould  objectively  and  rationally  define  the  needs  of  the  community. The\ntechnology could be used for focused targeting of beneficiaries, apart from\nplanning and monitoring and evaluation, to achieve global commitments such\nas the MDGs.\n\nFurthermore,  strengthening  the  capacities  of  LGUs  to  seek  out  new\nsources of revenues to supplement what they can generate apart and what the\nnational government is able to transfer to them is another possible area of\nadvocacy.\n\nNGOs and multinational agencies have as much responsibility to consider\nthe capabilities of the localities and recognize their role in the governance of\ndevelopment projects. In keeping with the spirit of PHC, they should involve\npeople\u2019s organizations in local governance to ensure that programs and services\nare appreciated and sustained.\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n655\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\f656\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nReferences\n\nAngelo King Institute School for Economic and Business Studies, De La Salle\nUniversity. 2005.

The  7-month  SARS\nproblem sparked public health issues and related economic, social, cultural,\nand psychological problems. The event also had a significant impact on PRC\u2019s\npolitics, economy, and society, especially public health. It is thus important to\nanalyze the impact of SARS, find out what problems remain, and examine\nthe  development  and  future  directions  of  the  public  health  emergency\npreparedness and response system in the PRC.\n\nThe history of mankind is a history of struggle with diseases that threaten\nsurvival and development. The shocks dealt by these diseases have often affected\nnot only the body but also the mind and the spirit. For this reason, there have\nbeen more severe than those caused by wars, revolutions, and riots. The SARS\noutbreak in the spring of 2003 is a case in point.\n\nThe outbreak lasted for about 220 days\u2014from 16 November 2002 (in\nGuangdong Province) until 24 June 2003, when the World Health Organization\nannounced that it was lifting its warning against travel to the PRC. In that\ntime, there were 8,430 cases of SARS. The PRC had 5,327 reported cases,\nincluding 349 deaths. SARS was reported to have caused a loss of $50 billion\nin Southeast Asia and CNYI51 billion (Ping 2005).\n\nFrom the first to the last case, the Chinese Communist Party, the new\nadministration, and local governments tried their best to deal with SARS and\nachieved temporary success. But the SARS crisis exposed weaknesses in the\ncountry\u2019s public health system. It showed that the PRC lacked the knowledge\n\n1 Assistant Professor, School of Humanities and Social Sciences, Nanyang Technological University,\n\n2 Deputy Director, Public Health Bureau, Jiangxi Province, People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nSingapore.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n662\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\fBuilding the Public Health Emergency Management System of the PRC\n\n663\n\nand the capacity to respond to public health emergencies. Disease prevention\nand control was deficient; the flow of information about the disease was not\nsmooth;  laboratories  had  no  quick-diagnosis  system;  monitoring  and\nenforcement was inadequate; medical care did not fit the requirements; laws\nand  regulations  were  incomplete;  government  functions  were  unclear;\ncoordination was weak. Moreover, the public psyche had been severely damaged\n(Wu 2003).\n\nThe experience with SARS showed that the management of public health\nemergencies had to be strengthened to guarantee the security and safety of the\ncountry, social stability, and the interests of the public.\n\nNow, 3 years after SARS, the PRC has built an emergency preparedness\nand response mechanism, as the Central Committee of Chinese Communist\nParty and the State Council planned, and with the help of relevant organizations\nand  medical  staff. The  system  covers  the  management  of  public  health\nemergencies,  disease  prevention  and  control,  medical  care,  and  health\nmaintenance and monitoring (Zhao 2003). The national Government and\nlocal governments have also restructured public expenditure to increase public\nhealth spending.\n\nYet much more needs to be done. Using Jiangxi Province as an example\nand data from surveys and focus group discussions, this paper looks at the\npresent status of public health and disease prevention in the PRC, reveals\nthe areas that still need to be addressed, and proposes policies to strengthen\nthe system.\n\nPublic Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Systems\n\nThe United States (US)\n\nThe public health emergency preparedness and response system in the\nthe United States (US) is one of the most advanced in the world. Through\nvertical (federal-state-local) coordination and horizontal collaboration among\ngovernment organizations, the US has built a comprehensive and multilayered\nresponse network for public health emergencies. When a significant public health\nemergency occurs, a system-wide alert is raised, a suitable response is readied,\nand information is fed into the federal emergency program via the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. The President decides,\ndepending on the nature and seriousness of the emergency, whether to declare\na state of emergency and start the federal emergency program (Zhang 2003).\nAt present, the US Government is improving the following aspects of\n\nthe response system (Liu and Hu 2003):\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n663\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\f664\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127) Preparedness  planning  and  assessment.

Training  personnel  for  public  health\nemergencies and communicating relevant information to the public\nthrough a variety of channels.\n\nThe PRC\n\nThe Government has prioritized to develop and improve the public health\nresponse system in view of the weaknesses revealed during the SARS outbreak.\nTo effectively prevent and immediately control and do away with public health\nthreats, ensure the health and safety of the public, maintain the normal social\norder,  and  build  a  lawful  system  of  information,  rapid  response,  vigorous\nmanagement, and clear responsibility to cope with public health emergencies,\nthe State Council, on 12 May 2003, passed a regulation governing the suitable\nresponse to public health emergencies. The regulation is based on the law on\nthe prevention and treatment of contagious diseases and other relevant laws,\nas well as the experience with SARS in early 2003. While its passage was an\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n664\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\fBuilding the Public Health Emergency Management System of the PRC\n\n665\n\nimmediate outcome of the SARS event, the regulation applies to all public\nhealth emergencies in the PRC. The SARS incident made the country realize\nthe importance and necessity of building a comprehensive response system\nfor public health emergencies. It is looking to borrow from the experience of\nother countries with more advanced systems and to adapt the experience to\nthe PRC context.\n\nResearch Questions and Methodology\n\nThis paper is mainly interested in two research questions related to the\n\nbuilding of the public health emergency management system:\n\n(cid:127) What is the status of the system and what remaining issues need to be\n\nsettled?\n\n(cid:127) What are the policy implications of the construction of the public\n\nhealth emergency management system?\n\nThe authors of this paper relied on empirical research (a case study) to\ndeal with the foregoing issues. Survey questionnaires, focus group discussions,\nindividual interviews, and a review of the experience of the PRC and other\ncountries, particularly the US, were used. The respondents were drawn from\namong the officials and staff of provincial health organizations in Jiangxi and\npublic health agencies in Nanchang and Ganzhou cities. Materials from other\nprovinces were also referred to for a broader understanding of the issues.\n\nThe 150 survey questionnaires sent out to public health agencies at the\nprovincial, prefecture, and county levels were all filled out and returned. The\norganizations surveyed included the Chinese Center for Disease Control and\nPrevention  (CDC),  hospitals,  and  health  surveillance,  administration,\neducation, and other agencies. The questionnaires were distributed as follows:\nJiangxi Provincial Health Bureau, 10; Jiangxi Provincial Medical University,\n10;    Jiangxi  Provincial  CDC,  15;  Jiangxi  Provincial  Health  Surveillance\nInstitute, 15; Health Bureau of Nanchang City, 10; Health Bureau of Ganzhou\nCity, 10; CDC of Ganzhou City, 30; The First People\u2019s Hospital of Ganzhou\nCity, 30; and Health Surveillance Institute of Ganzhou, 20.\n\nThe survey questionnaires asked three open-ended questions:\n\n(cid:127)\n\nIs the provincial public health response system adequate or not?

Of the 76 respondents, 25 had bachelor\u2019s degrees, 31 had\nmaster\u2019s degrees, and 15 had doctoral degrees; five gave no details about their\neducational qualifications. The respondents comprised 24 administrative staff\n(31.6%), 51 professional personnel (67.1%), and one whose job position was\nunspecified.\n\nThe analysis and proposed policy recommendations in this paper were\n\nbased on these primary and secondary data.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n666\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\fBuilding the Public Health Emergency Management System of the PRC\n\n667\n\nAdministrative Constraints on the Public Health Response System\nof the PRC\n\n The  PRC  has  a  vast  territory  (9.6  million  square  kilometers)  and  a\npopulation of about 1.3 billion. Its economic and social development is still\nlow, and public health emergencies are frequent.\n\nThe  PRC  has  dealt  with  a  number  of  such  emergencies  in  the  last  5\ndecades, among them, the cholera epidemic of Yang Jiang City in Guangdong\nProvince in 1961 and the hepatitis A outbreak in Shanghai in 1988. Thus, the\nPRC has had some experience in preventing and treating contagious diseases.\nNevertheless, the PRC tends to be tentative and to rely on compulsion in\ndealing with public health emergencies. This approach may be effective in the\nshort run but is wasteful of resources. Agencies are created ad hoc and are\ndissolved after the crisis. Thus, the rich experience of handling the crisis is not\nsummarized, systematized, and institutionalized, and the experience is not\nshared throughout the country.\n\nThe SARS epidemic in 2003 had a significant impact on the economic\ndevelopment, social stability, and foreign relations of the PRC. Among the\nmain reasons for the spread of SARS in the early stage were the defects in the\npublic health response system. The PRC lacked the capacity to cope with and\nmanage the crisis.\n\nBlind Faith in Economic Growth and Market Principles\n\nThe  Government  has  often  emphasized  the  country\u2019s  focus  on\ndevelopment.  But  development  has  been  narrowly  interpreted  to  mean\neconomic growth. Other areas, public health among them, have had to give\nway to the pursuit of economic development (Ge 2005). There seems to be a\nconsensus  that  development  is  the  answer  to  a  host  of  problems.  The\nassumption is that as long as economic growth is maintained and the pie gets\nprogressively bigger, other issues as public welfare can easily be solved. Indeed,\nif all social classes closed the fruits of economic growth, public welfare would\nimprove.  However,  the  fruits  of  economic  growth  are  not  equally  shared.\nTherefore, regardless of how fast the economy grows, public welfare will not\nimprove.\n\nOn the other hand, the country has put too much trust in the market in\nmany areas, including public health. Behind health sector and other reforms\nis  the  unproved  assumption  that  the  market  can  allocate  resources  more\nefficiently. In reality, this assumption could hardly be farther from the truth.\nIn public health as in other areas of life, human behavior has externalities,\ninformation is asymmetric, and information asymmetry leads to market failure.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n667\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\f668\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nIn short, blind faith in economic growth has resulted in the failure of\ngovernment to shoulder its responsibility, and blind belief in the market has\nresulted in unequal and inefficient allocation of health resources.\n\nInability of the Current System to Cope with the New Situation\n\nMany countries have built emergency management systems. International\norganizations  have  also  prepared  crisis  management  plans  for  coping  with\nepidemics, natural disasters, and wars that cost millions of lives (Qin 2003).\nIn  the  US,  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency  has  a  system  of\nassessment, recovery, and management, and an innovative emergency response\nsystem  (www.fema.gov/tabs_disaster.shtml).  Believing  that  public  health  is\npart of national security and is as important as defense, financial stability, and\ninformation security, the US established and strengthened its public health\nresponse  system.  The  electronic  surveillance  and  reporting  system  has\nsubsystems for different types of diseases. The objective is to detect signs of a\ndisease  outbreak  early  enough  to  prepare  and  respond  adequately  (Huang\n2003). Communication is an essential part of these emergency systems.\n\nIn the PRC, the traditional way of handling an epidemic is to conceal it\nfrom the public. Without information from the Government, the public relies\non rumors, and rumors feed confusion and panic.\n\nTo improve its image and earn the public trust, the Government must\nhandle public health emergencies with greater openness and transparency. There\nmust be open, timely, and smooth flow of information to the public. Public\nhealth, after all, is all about the public, and the public has the right to know.\n\nShortage of Public Health Resources\n\nThe shortage of public health resources and the policy of requiring the\nhealth sector to fend for itself have jeopardized and even paralyzed the public\nhealth defense system. Public finance is market economy finance in essence.\nAs such, it should not intervene in areas where the market is effective but\nshould play a role where the market cannot effectively solve the problems (Xia\n2004). Public health cannot rely solely on the market economy to provide\nservices. Thus, government intervention is necessary in arranging financing\nand promoting usage. Public finance should be central to public health.\n\nPerceived Defects of the Public Health Response System\nin the PRC\n\nThe SARS emergency revealed the vulnerability and inefficiency of the\npublic health response system in the PRC. At least six problems weigh down\nthe system.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n668\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\fBuilding the Public Health Emergency Management System of the PRC\n\n669\n\nFirst, the response management system is not equipped to respond. Health\nresources  are  vertically  and  horizontally  segregated.  Communication  and\ncoordination are not sound, and some local governments cannot manage on\ntheir own. Thus, it is hard to integrate resources effectively. In the face of\npublic  health  emergencies,  there  is  no  mechanism  for  coordinating  the\nparticipation of several organizations. Vertical management is unclear, as is\nthe devolution of authority to local governments. Local governments do not\nfeel quite responsible, in the belief that such emergencies are properly the\ndomain of public health agencies. On the other hand, public health agencies\nare not sufficiently empowered to act (Li 2003).\n\nSecond, response plans are absent or ineffective. The agencies therefore\nhave no clear duties and tasks, and management and operations are poorly\ncoordinated.  The  surveillance  warning  system  is  not  reliable;  response\nequipment and facilities are far from adequate. Some places stay passive for\nsome time. Thorough drills involving different agencies are rare. When public\nhealth emergencies as the SARS epidemic arise, public health organizations\nare unprepared and do not know what to do (An 2004).\n\nThird, information reporting is not sound. Data on epidemics are not\nefficiently collected, analyzed, and reported. Governments and relevant agencies\nare slow to grasp emergencies. The PRC is not inferior to advanced countries\nin the number of hospitals. Beijing, for example, has 275 hospitals, including\nabout 70 \u201ctriple AAA\u201d hospitals. However, these 275 hospitals belong to eight\ndifferent systems, including those of the Ministry of Public Health, the People\u2019s\nLiberation Army, and the Medical Branch of Beijing University, and thus do\nnot  exchange  information  (http://industry.ccidnet.com/art/35/20040409/\n101608_1.html, accessed on 8 October 2005).\n\nThe  vertical  and  horizontal  segregation  of  hospitals  and  the  lack  of\ninformation exchange were to blame for the initially passive reaction to SARS\nin Beijing. Public health agencies could not get accurate information in time,\nand frontline medical staff could not receive relevant background materials as\nwell as information on clinical behavior and means of prevention and cure.\nFourth, the capacity for responsive medical care is not adequate. Many\nmedical organizations are not equipped for emergencies and the medical staff\nlack knowledge of emergency prevention and response techniques. The SARS\nepisode also exposed the risk of contamination in hospitals. Internal contagion\nmanagement in hospitals is the task of the contagion and defense section. But\nthis section is usually the weakest. Moreover, brain drain has seriously depleted\npersonnel resources in many places, especially in the old base of the revolution,\nminority regions, hinterlands, and poor areas. The age and specialty structure\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n669\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\f670\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nof the current staff is unsatisfactory. With the current staff, the PRC will be\nhard put to meet the challenge of future public health emergencies.\n\nFifth, the disease prevention and control system is weak. Less than 1%\nof public health staff have master\u2019s degrees. In the US, about 10% to 20% of\nsuch  staff  have  master\u2019s  degrees  in  public  health  (MPH)  or  other  relevant\ndegrees, and 5% to 6% of those working in the public policy area have MPH\ndegrees. At each level of disease prevention and control in the PRC, poorly\nqualified  personnel  and  backward  medical  equipment  are  common.  In\naddition, there is no clear division of labor, and efficiency suffers. The public\nhealth sector is in urgent need of an emergency response workforce armed\nwith sound public health knowledge (Li 2003).\n\nSixth, the legal infrastructure for handling public health emergencies is\ndeficient. During the SARS period, only the Contagious Disease Prevention\nand  Remedy  Law  was  available.  Legalizing  administrative  authority  for\nemergency management is a worldwide issue. While the Constitution regulates\nemergency status, administrative power in emergencies must be authorized\nby law. The public health emergency response regulations passed with urgency\nby the State Council in 2003 are far from complete. Detailed laws must be\npassed for coping with different types of emergencies (Yang 2005).\n\nThese problems, and others, have serious consequences. When public\nhealth emergencies happen, they cannot be effectively addressed and controlled\nin time. Thus, epidemics spread and persist. Not only do they threaten the\nhealth  of  the  public,  they  also  have  significant  impact  on  economic\ndevelopment and social stability (Gao 2004).\n\nPolicy Recommendations for Improving the Public Health\nResponse System\n\nIn the global SARS crisis of 2003, the PRC was the hardest hit. The\ncrisis severely tested the capacity of the Government to handle emergencies\nand exposed its inexperience in dealing with large-scale public health crises. It\nraised challenges and questions for the public health management system of\nthe country in general. The PRC has no public health alert and treatment\nsystem. But a response mechanism for emergent public health emergencies\nhas been initially set up (The 2003 Executive Order 376 of the State Council,\nEmergent Public Health Responsive Regulations).\n\nThe  surveys  of  the  Ministry  of  Public  Health  and  the  Public  Health\nBureau of Jiangxi Province indicate that the PRC has made a good start in\nestablishing and improving its public health response system. Still, there are\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n670\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\n\fBuilding the Public Health Emergency Management System of the PRC\n\n671\n\nproblems. The  crisis  mind-set  is  not  firmly  ingrained  in  the  public  health\nagencies,  which  are  not  attuned  to  effectively  addressing  public  health\nemergencies.  Communication  and  education  in  public  health  emergencies\nare  inadequate. The  public  does  not  know  enough  to  protect  itself  and  is\ntherefore easily driven to panic. At the grassroots level, the CDC and medical\ninstitutions have weak capacity to prevent and deal with epidemics. Medical\npersonnel are poorly qualified and do not have much opportunity to learn.\nThey can hardly identify major epidemics. Funding for public health is far\nfrom enough. Because of the funding shortage, grassroots prevention is difficult\nor even impossible. The legal infrastructure has yet to be completed.\n\nCoordination in emergencies is a significant problem. There is a lack of\nconcerted effort between the public health sector and other departments. Many\nother  areas\u2014such  as  public  finance,  education  and  communication  for\nemergency management, personnel training, public health response system in\nthe  rural  areas,  and  the  speed  and  sensitivity  of  the  response\u2014need  to  be\nstrengthened.\n\nFrom the Jiangxi survey, 89 of the 150 respondents (59.3%) considered\nthe response system inadequate. Lack of funding is still a bottleneck, particularly\nfor public health in the local areas. For lack of funds and attention, the necessary\nequipment cannot be purchased and training is inadequate. The respondents\nwere concerned about the effectiveness of the response workforce, security of\nresponse  supplies  and  equipment,  preparedness,  coordination  between\nprevention and cure, and the legal framework.\n\nThe following principles are offered to guide improvements in the public\n\nhealth response system of the PRC:\n\n(cid:127) Establish  a  response  system  that  is  in  harmony  with  the  Chinese\n\ncontext and strengthen the system.\n\n(cid:127) Make prevention the priority.\n(cid:127) Build  a  strong  response  workforce  to  prevent,  control,  and  cure\ndiseases. Recruit and train more people, and equip them with the\nright techniques and materials.\n\n(cid:127) Constantly deepen awareness of crisis.\n(cid:127)\nStrengthen communication and education in public health events.\n(cid:127) Monitor public health activities according to the law and establish a\n\nresponsibility system.\n\nSession 6.pmd\n\n671\n\n22/11/2006, 9:03 AM\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\f672\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nReferences\n\nAn,  Xuejun.  2004.

Its  formation  reflected  a  shared  view  among  those  in  the\nconsortium that one of the significant challenges for all governments in the\n21st century was to enhance the breadth and depth of policy and management\nskills  in  government,  and  accordingly  invest  in  the  further  education  and\ndevelopment of those who are destined to be leaders of the public sector.\n\nThe founding members of ANZSOG comprised five governments\u2014\nthe  national  governments  of  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  and  the  state\ngovernments of New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria; nine universities;\nand one business school, the Melbourne Business School. The universities\nthat joined the consortium were the Australian National University; Griffith\nUniversity; Monash University; the Universities of Canberra, Melbourne, New\nSouth Wales, Queensland, and Sydney; and Victoria University of Wellington.\nThe objective of these founding members was to create a first-tier school of\ngovernment that was equivalent to the best international business schools and\nschools of government, and whose programs would be tailored to the unique\nneeds of the Australian and New Zealand governments.\n\nNow in its 4th year of operation, the school offers a master\u2019s-level program\nin public administration (the Executive Master of Public Administration, or\nEMPA), offered in partnership with all but one of its member universities; a\nnon-award-based senior executive program (the Executive Fellows Program);\nand a growing range of other specialized non-award-based short programs for\nemerging leaders in the public and not-for-profit sectors.\n\n1 Academic Director, EMPA Program, Australia and New Zealand School of Government (ANZSOG),\n\nCarlton, Australia.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n677\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\f678\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nThe EMPA Program\n\nObjectives\n\nThe EMPA program was created to address as a priority issue the need\nfor participating governments to develop high-potential successor pools of\nappropriate breadth and depth. The intention was that the EMPA provide\nparticipants in Australia and New Zealand with an educational experience of\ncomparable quality to the postgraduate degrees in public administration and\npublic policy offered by flagship schools of government around the world\u2014\nsuch as the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, the Maxwell School\nat Syracuse, the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California\nat Berkeley, the Ford School at University of Michigan, and the Woodrow\nWilson School of Public Policy at Princeton.\n\nThe EMPA is designed to develop world-class public sector managers\n\nwho:\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\nhave a broad view of, and an excellent skill base in, management,\nservice delivery, and policy analysis across the spectrum of public sector\nactivities;\ndemonstrate  a  critical  understanding  of  the  central  concepts  and\nliterature from the fields of public administration, public management,\nand public policy;\ncan  undertake  critical  analyses  of  public  sector  issues,  using\nmultidisciplinary perspectives, and engage in informed debate on the\nissues;\ncan  understand  and  apply  research  methods  and  undertake\nindependent research;\nare prepared for and committed to a long-term career path in the\npublic service; and\ncan improve service delivery and policy outcomes across all levels of\nthe public sector of Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIn summary, the EMPA is designed to enhance the depth and breadth of\nmanagement and policy skills of high-potential public sector managers, to\nprovide these managers with the tools and frameworks needed to be clearer\nabout the value public managers deliver to the public, and to better equip\npublic managers to manage complex accountabilities in the face of shifting\npolitical, economic, and organizational environments.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n678\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\fInnovations in Teaching Public Policy and Management: The Case of ANZSOG\u2019s EMPA Program\n\n679\n\nStructure\n\nThe EMPA is a 2-year, part-time university degree program offered in\npartnership with all of ANZSOG\u2019s member universities except the University\nof Queensland. The school itself does not award the degree in its own name.\nRather, EMPA candidates enroll in one of the school\u2019s partner universities\nand upon successful completion of the course are awarded their degree from\nthat university.\n\nDesigned in close consultation with the funding jurisdictions, the degree\nhas been tailored to the specific needs of future public sector leaders. Of the\n10  subjects  in  the  EMPA,  seven  are  core  subjects  delivered  by  ANZSOG\nteaching faculty. The three remaining elective subjects are taken by each student\nat the university of his or her enrollment. One elective must be taken in the\nfield of public sector financial management, and the other two electives are\nexpected  to  be  chosen  from  disciplines  related  to  public  policy  and\nmanagement.  Students  may  choose  electives  to  establish  a  bridge  between\ntheir  past  study  and  experience  and  the  core  curriculum  to  enhance  their\nknowledge in a specific discipline, or to enhance their knowledge of a specific\npolicy area, such as health, education, or the environment.\n\nCurriculum\n\nThe curriculum of the EMPA was developed after extensive consultation\nwith public sector chief executive officers in member governments. Initially\nthese consultations were conducted by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG),\nwhich led to the sketching out of a 10-unit program, of which 70% would be\ndelivered by the school as core subjects. The details of the curriculum were\nfinalized  after  considerable  input  from  leading  academics  in  the  partner\nteaching institutions. The finalized curriculum reflects the spirit of the original\nBCG proposal\u2014maintaining a strong focus on the role of the manager within\nthe public sector, emphasizing problem solving and cross-disciplinary learning,\nand involving a careful blend of academics and practitioners (including current\nand former political leaders) as teachers.\n\nThe seven core subjects in the EMPA are:\n\n(cid:127) Delivering Public Value\u2014reflects the reality that delivering value to\nthe public is the essential management task of government today.

Public  managers  need  to  understand  frameworks  for\nsuccessful problem solving, policy context, institutions and processes\nsurrounding  policy  advice,  various  frameworks  for  explaining  the\nrationale and role of government in policy development, intervention\nlogic, and public management initiatives and strategies for linking\noutputs to outcomes.\n\n(cid:127) Government in a Market Economy\u2014is a compulsory subject because\na  more  outward-looking  public  sector  culture  calls  for  a  robust\nunderstanding of what is valuable individually and collectively, and\nhow the workings of markets, governments, and other institutions\naffect the value. This means understanding both how markets work\nand how they can fail\u2014and balancing this understanding with an\nappreciation of how government can add value and how governments\ncan  fail.  In  many  areas  of  government  activity,  market-related\ndisciplines  do  not  apply,  increasing  the  risk  that  real  costs  will  be\nopaque or disguised.\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127) Decision Making Under Uncertainty\u2014addresses the requirement that\nmanagers  in  government  must  become  more  critical  users  of\ninformation and evidence.

Over the past 30 years, an array\nof  global  and  domestic  pressures  has  significantly  changed  the\nchallenges  confronting  government.

Public  managers  need  to  have  an  applied\nappreciation of the role of legislation, regulations, and conventions;\ntheir importance to good government; and how the authority of the\nState is appropriately used to deliver government objectives in accord\nwith the underpinnings of the system of government.\n\n(cid:127) Work-based Project\u2014the final compulsory subject is a team-based\nresearch project addressing a real-life issue confronting government.\nProjects typically span jurisdictions, and disciplines, and the work of\nthe teams reflects the fact that many issues in government are now\nfrequently addressed collaboratively and interjurisdictionally rather\nthan individually.\n\nThe  core  curriculum  of  the  EMPA  is  thus  multidisciplinary  and\napplication-oriented, and emphasizes technique, experience, judgement, and\nvalues\u2014in short, the \u201ctrade craft\u201d of government.

Delivering Public Value, which starts the program, and\nLeading Public Sector Change are currently delivered in residential intensive\nmode over 5 days to the entire cohort of about 125 students. Governing by\nthe Rules and Designing Public Policies and Programs are also delivered in\nresidential  mode  over  5  days  to  cohorts  of  about  60  and  40,  respectively.\nDecision Making Under Uncertainty and Government in a Market Economy\nare taught in each jurisdiction over 5 days in blocks of 1\u20132 days over a period\nof 3 months.

In\nthe  main,  ANZSOG  faculty  are  drawn  from  the  partner  universities  and\nbusiness schools.\n\nTeaching Philosophy\n\ndistinctive features. These include:\n\nThe  teaching  philosophy  in  the  EMPA  program  has  a  number  of\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\na primary focus on the public sector and specifically the management-\npolicy intersection;\nan emphasis on interactive learning and in particular the use of case\nstudies, most of which have been developed by ANZSOG\u2019s own Case\nStudy Program;\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n683\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\f684\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\nthe inter-jurisdictional nature of much of the learning process, and\nespecially  the  use  of  teams  or  groups  to  undertake  learning  and\nassessment tasks;\nthe use of expert guest presenters from government and elsewhere;\nand\ncontinuous  improvement  through  the  completion  of  subject\nevaluations by students and regular feedback from key stakeholders.\n\nRole of Case Teaching\n\nWith the creation of ANZSOG came a conscious decision to avoid the\ntraditional didactic (or \u201cchalk and talk\u201d) approach to postgraduate teaching.\nInstead, a far more interactive approach, in which students assume greater\nresponsibility for their learning, was adopted. At the forefront of this approach\nis the use of case studies, potentially involving all participants in class discussion,\nchallenging students to reflect on judgments and opinions, and enabling them\nto experience the dilemmas that a real manager is likely to face.\n\nThe educational rationale of the case method is firmly located within\nthe problem-based learning paradigm. Case studies, which involve real-life\nsituations  that  have  confronted  public  sector  managers,  are  considered  a\npowerful means of exploring how key theories and concepts imparted by the\ncourse may inform problem solving and decision making. Learning with cases\nenables students \u201cto take on the roles and responsibilities of specific people in\nspecific organisations\u2026to become deeply involved in decisions actually faced\nby real people in real organisations; to take ownership, to feel pressure, to\nrecognize the risks, and to expose your ideas to others\u201d (Mauffette-Leenders\net al. 2001, p. 3). Through case studies, students can place concepts in context\nand  gain  an  appreciation  of  their  significance  and  relevance  to  differing\ncircumstances. As Mauffette-Leenders et al. observe, cases give students \u201ca\nchance to practice the art as well as the science of management in a laboratory\nsetting, with little corporate and personal risk involved\u201d (2001, p. 4).\n\nCase studies are extensively used in the EMPA program. Preparation for\na class involving case discussion will typically require that students read and\nreread the case circulated in advance of the class and consider a small number\nof key questions in groups of four to six students before the class meets. This\npreparation enables each student to contribute to discussion in class and to\nmaximize their learning from the case study.\n\nThe ANZSOG Case Study Program\n\nThe ANZSOG Case Study Program developed nearly every case study\nused  in  the  EMPA  program. This  program,  which  has  been  developed  in\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n684\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\fInnovations in Teaching Public Policy and Management: The Case of ANZSOG\u2019s EMPA Program\n\n685\n\nANZSOG to enhance and extend the teaching options for ANZSOG courses,\noffers  high-quality,  topical  case  studies  for  public  sector  management\ndevelopment,  with  a  focus  on  current  events  and  issues  in  Australia,  New\nZealand, Commonwealth countries, and Pacific and Southeast Asian countries.\nWith  dedicated  case  writers  in  both  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  the\nANZSOG Case Study Program has in a very short time built a collection of\nsome over 70 cases covering real-life episodes in Australia, New Zealand, and\nelsewhere.  While  this  in-house  development  of  teaching  material  is  not\nunique\u2014the Harvard Business School has a similar program\u2014it is a highly\ndistinctive aspect of the EMPA program that sets it apart from other master\u2019s\nprograms in public management and public policy in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nGroup-based Learning and Assessment\n\nAnother distinctive feature of the EMPA teaching philosophy is group-\nbased learning and assessment. Each core subject in the program usually has at\nleast one piece, and often two pieces, of assessment prepared by cross-jurisdictional\nteams of four to six students. The justification for this arrangement is that it\nplaces students in a fairly accurate approximation of the real world\u2014where the\nachievement of goals frequently depends on the successful navigation of complex\nworking relationships with others. Research consistently indicates that the ability\nto  collaborate  creatively,  write,  and  manage  tasks  and  projects  is  becoming\nincreasingly important in the business environment (Pfaff and Huddleston 2003).\nThe academic literature also reports that collaborative learning has the potential\nto increase individual achievement more than individual or competitive learning.\nThis is so, it is argued, because collaborative learning requires persistence when\nfacing  adversity,  willingness  to  perform  difficult  tasks,  ability  to  translate\nknowledge  from  one  task  to  another,  greater  social  skills,  and  intrinsic\nmotivation (Johnson, Johnson, and Smith 1998).\n\nSubject Evaluations\n\nAt the end of each core EMPA subject, students complete a comprehensive\nevaluation covering all aspects of the curriculum, teaching (including teaching\nmaterials),  workload,  teaching  facilities,  meals,  accommodation  (if\nappropriate), and other support services. The purpose of these evaluations is\ntwofold. The first is to gain an overall assessment of the subject, in terms of\nboth its academic content and its management\u2014in other words, to gain an\nimpression of how a subject is \u201ctraveling.\u201d The other purpose of the evaluations\nis to gain a more specific understanding of how the student cohort  perceives\neach element of the subject. To this end, every session and every presenter  the\nstudents evaluate.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n685\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\f686\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nSubject evaluations, once collated and \u201ccrunched,\u201d are made available to\nthe dean, the academic director of the EMPA, and the subject leader. The key\nfindings from these evaluations play a critical role in the debriefing process\nthat follows each subject\u2019s delivery. The feedback from the evaluations also\nplays an essential part in the final shape and delivery of a subject in its next\niteration. Summaries of subject evaluations are made available to the school\u2019s\nEMPA committee and the ANZSOG board.\n\nProblem-based Learning\n\nThe  teaching  philosophy  that  the  EMPA  program  has  adopted\u2014\ncharacterized by the use of case studies, a high level of interaction, and student-\nbased learning in groups\u2014has much in common with the concept of problem-\nbased learning (PBL) popularized in US medical schools some 30\u201340 years\nago.  According  to  Vernon  and  Blake  (1993,  p.  600),  PBL  is  more  than  a\nsimple  teaching  method.  It  is  \u201ca  complex  mixture  of  a  general  teaching\nphilosophy, learning objectives and goals, and faculty attitudes and values.\u201d\n\nThe Process of Problem-based Learning\n\nReflecting  on  the  process  of  PBL  within  the  paradigm  of  medical\npedagogy, Schmidt (1983) reports that it might typically start with a description\nof  a  clinical  situation  where  a  patient  sees  a  doctor  with  an  undiagnosed\ncomplaint. The PBL process might then proceed as follows:\n\nStep1: Clarify terms and concepts not readily comprehensible.\nStep 2: Define the problem.\nStep 3: Analyze the problem.\nStep 4: Draw a systematic inventory of the explanation inferred from\n\nStep 5: Formulate learning objectives.\nStep 6: Collect additional information outside the group.\nStep 7: Synthesize and test the newly acquired information.\n\nstep 3.\n\n(1983, p. 13)\n\nWriting about the application of PBL to nonmedical teaching, Hadgraft\n(2000, p. 3) argues that problem-based learning has the following key elements:\n\na problem as the focus of learning;\nintegration of many concepts and skills required in the resolution of\nthe problem;\n\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n686\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\fInnovations in Teaching Public Policy and Management: The Case of ANZSOG\u2019s EMPA Program\n\n687\n\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n\nteamwork (which can make the process easier or sometimes harder);\na problem-solving process; and\na commitment to self-learning.\n\nPBL, thus contrasts starkly with the conventional didactic approach, in\nwhich students are instructed by teachers whose primary role is to impart\nknowledge, and in which assessment tasks are completed individually.\n\nThe Benefits of Problem-based Learning\n\nSchmidt (1993, p. 428) reports that PBL has the following cognitive\n\neffects on student learning:\n\n(cid:127) Activation  of  prior  knowledge. The  initial  analysis  of  a  problem\n\nstimulates the retrieval of knowledge acquired earlier.\n\n(cid:127) Elaboration of prior knowledge through small-group discussion, both\nbefore or after new knowledge has been acquired; active processing of\nnew information.\n\n(cid:127) Restructuring of knowledge to fit the problem presented; construction\n\nof an appropriate semantic network.\nLearning in context. The problem serves as a scaffold for storing cues\nthat may support the retrieval of relevant knowledge when needed\nfor similar problems.\n\n(cid:127) Emergence  of  epistemic  curiosity,  since  students  see  the  problems\n\npresented as relevant and engage in open-ended discussion.\n\nNorman and Schmidt (1992) report that students in PBL curricula are\nlikely to be more highly motivated, better problem-solvers, and self-directed\nlearners, better able to learn and recall information, and better able to integrate\nbasic science knowledge into the solutions of clinical problems. Vernon and\nBlake (1993) confirm these claims, reporting that:\n\nStudent attitudes, class attendance, and student moods were generally\nmore positive for PBL than for traditional courses or curricula.\nFaculty who participated in both PBL and more traditional teaching\nwere relatively positive about PBL.\n\n(cid:127) There was more self-directed learning in PBL programs.\n(cid:127)\n\nPBL  students  placed  greater  emphasis  on  understanding  and\ncorrespondingly less emphasis on memorizing.\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n687\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\f688\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nVernon and Blake thus conclude that \u201cstudents in PBL programs place\nmore emphasis on \u201cmeaning\u201d (understanding) than on \u201creproducing\u201d (rote\nlearning and memorization)\u201d (1993, p. 556). This is generally consistent with\nHadgraft\u2019s view that by placing students in a situation similar to that in which\ngraduates would find themselves on entering the workforce, PBL trains students\n\u201cto be problem solvers and lifelong learners\u201d (2000, p. 3).\n\nThe claims made in relation to PBL are very similar to those made for\nthe case-learning process. Mauffette et al. refer to \u201can inventory of skills\u201d being\ndeveloped  by  the  case  method  of  learning. These  include  analytical  skills,\ndecision-making  skills,  application  skills,  oral  communication  skills,  time\nmanagement skills, interpersonal or social skills, creative skills, and written\ncommunication skills (2001, pp. 5\u20136). This \u201cinventory of skills\u201d resonates\nwith Hadgraft\u2019s conclusions that PBL draws on students\u2019 ability to undertake\ngroup  work,  meeting  skills,  time  management  skills,  information  retrieval\nskills, and communication skills (2000).\n\nReview of EMPA Program\n\nWhen  the  first  cohort  of  students  completed  their  studies  in  2005,\nANZSOG  initiated  the  first  review  of  the  EMPA  program. The  school\ndetermined that the review should focus on the curriculum, teaching methods,\nand structure of the program within the framework of the course adopted\nwhen the school was established. The purpose of the review was to evaluate\nthe overall effectiveness of the program for agencies and individual participants.\nThe review thus sought feedback from students, line managers, chief executives,\nand other senior staff within sponsoring agencies; partner universities; teaching\nfaculty; and presenters.\n\nStudent Feedback\n\nData collected as part of the review process strongly endorsed the teaching\nphilosophy underpinning the EMPA program. Specifically, student feedback\n(compiled from completed questionnaires) confirmed that the program had:\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n\nincreased  students\u2019  knowledge  of  public  management  and  public\npolicy;\nincreased students\u2019 skills and competencies;\nassisted in shaping strategic thinking;\nincreased students\u2019 ability to communicate with influence;\nhelped students in developing productive relationships;\nbeen relevant to the workplace; and\nhad a positive impact on sponsoring agencies.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n688\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\fInnovations in Teaching Public Policy and Management: The Case of ANZSOG\u2019s EMPA Program\n\n689\n\nData  collected  from  the  students\u2019  questionnaires  also  confirmed  that\nEMPA learning had been both applied and shared in the workplace. Students\nreported that behavioral changes as a result of participation in the EMPA had\nhad a noticeable impact on individual and team performance in the workplace.\nIndeed, 44% of students participating in the review had received a promotion\nsince starting the program, and an overwhelming proportion of respondents\nthought that the program would enhance their career progression. All students\nresponding  to  the  review  believed  that  the  program  had  provided  many\nopportunities for cross-jurisdiction and cross-agency networking, and that they\nwould continue to use and develop the networks established through the course.\nStudent feedback was especially illuminating in relation to the use of\ncase  studies  and  group  work.  Case  studies  were  strongly  supported  as  an\neffective teaching strategy and syndicate groups were also strongly endorsed\nfor both learning and networking. Written comments indicated that students\nsaw  case  studies  as  providing  valuable  insights  into  real  issues  faced  by\norganizations, and enabling students to see how the principles and concepts\nunderpinning their studies were applied in the \u201creal world.\u201d\n\nManager Feedback\n\nAs  part  of  the  review  of  the  EMPA  program,  detailed  questionnaires\nwere also sent to managers of students, asking for feedback on their experience\nin  the  program. The  feedback  was  extremely  positive.  An  overwhelming\nproportion of responses  to the review reported that:\n\nParticipants had a highly favorable opinion of the program.\n\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127) Managers were aware of students sharing what they had learned from\nthe program (e.g., through discussion in seminars and meetings) with\nother staff in their agency.\n\n(cid:127) The program had a positive impact on the participants\u2019 capability\nand performance in the areas of strategic thinking, communicating\nwith  influence,  development  of  productive  working  relationships,\nachievement of results, and personal drive and integrity.\n\n(cid:127) The program was of value to the agency in delivering government\n\npriorities.\n(cid:127)\nParticipants had extended their networks through the program.\n(cid:127) The program had enhanced participants\u2019 leadership capabilities and\n\npotential.\n\n(cid:127) Managers would recommend the EMPA program to others.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n689\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\f690\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nWritten comments from managers confirmed that they saw the program\nas one that broadens the experiences, skills, and knowledge base of students,\nwho gain a much wider appreciation of the broader environment as a result of\ntheir participation in the program. Managers reported that students became\nmore highly skilled and confident with better networks, as well as demonstrated\nenhanced breadth and depth of policy and management skills.\n\nAs the EMPA program only commenced in 2003, it is not possible at\nthis early stage to reach any definitive conclusions in relation to the program\nand  its  teaching  philosophy.  Such  conclusions  would  need  to  wait  until  a\nmore thorough and authoritative assessment of the program is possible. So\nwhile any conclusions drawn from data generated by the EMPA review must\nnecessarily be regarded as being preliminary, it is nonetheless gratifying to\nobserve how much of the data appeared to affirm the school\u2019s basic philosophy\nand approach.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe  ANZSOG  EMPA  program  was  developed  with  the  objective  of\nbuilding capability to meet the emerging challenges confronting governments\nin Australia and New Zealand. In its design and delivery, the EMPA program\nsought to provide a learning experience that would be comparable in quality\nwith  that  provided  at  the  foremost  schools  of  public  policy  and  public\nadministration around the world.\n\nAt  the  core  of  the  EMPA  program  is  a  strong  and  uncompromising\nemphasis on teaching quality. The key features of this approach can be seen in\nthe  cross-disciplinary  curriculum  and  learning  activities,  multiple  delivery\nmodes, the extensive use of group or team-based learning and assessment, in-\nhouse development of teaching material, rigorous evaluations conducted at\nthe end of each subject, and, perhaps most particularly, the highly interactive\n(as  opposed  to  passive)  teaching  style  linked  to  the  use  of  case  studies\nthroughout  the  program.

Teaching public administration and public policy,\nwhich involves a myriad of issues and concerns, necessitates a very effective\ninstructional method that challenges students \u201cto learn how to learn.\u201d Many\nteachers, as is common in the academe, favor the content-coverage paradigm\u2014\ninstructing primarily through lecture-discussion. Such a teaching tradition\nhas  limitations  in  typical  classrooms  with  their  conventional  study  chairs,\noften with fixed seating arrangements, where small-group study areas are rare.\nThis simply indicates that, too often in the academe, there is a preference for\nreflecting on theory rather than doing small experiments. Thus, the incremental\nbody of knowledge about how students learn must be reengineered to create a\nshift from the traditional lecture-discussion method to a more sensitive and\nresponsive  method  that  will  enable  students  achieve  higher  levels  of\ncomprehension. There  is  a  need  to  move  from  traditional  course-based\ndiscipline, with a passive recipient of knowledge, to active learning. Teaching\nought not to be seen as a set of learned skills but rather as the application of\nparticular  knowledge,  skills,  and  dispositions  through  a  problem-solving\napproach. This makes learning more relevant to the real world, promotes critical\nthinking, and encourages self-directed learning. This paper, therefore, aims to\nput  across  a  far-reaching  teaching  approach  anchored  on  problem-based\nlearning as practiced in the Graduate School of Capitol University, Cagayan\nde Oro City, Philippines.\n\nThe Main Issue\n\nThis paper demonstrates one very specific issue that faces both professors\nand students in public administration and policy. It derives from the fact that\nwhat is provided in the law regarding public administration and public policy\nin many cases does not match actual practice. The process often contradicts\nthe policy. And the students are understandably confused. While students are\nexposed to a working knowledge of political theories, their learning experience\n\n1 Vice-President for Academic Affairs, Capitol University, Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n692\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\fThe Problem-Based Learning Approach: Issues and Concerns\n\n693\n\nwould be enriched if it were three-dimensional: personal, pedagogical, and\ninteractional. This trilogy explains how the learner gets into a kind of confusion\nas he approaches the issue/problem. The tri-dimensional approach will show\nhow the personal point of view of the learner as well as his previous learning\nexperiences and his interaction with the group will affect the new learning.\nThis approach, which is discussed in the rest of this paper, encompasses the\nproblem-based learning (PBL) method.\n\nMoving toward the Concept\n\nFinkle and Torp (1995) define PBL as a curriculum development and\ninstructional  system  that  simultaneously  develops  both  problem-solving\nstrategies and disciplinary knowledge bases and skills by confronting students\nwith ill-structured problems that mirror those in the real world and to which\nthey must find meaningful solutions. As discussed by Woods (1996), PBL is\nany learning environment in which the problem drives the learning. That is,\nbefore students learn some knowledge they are given a problem. The problem\nis  posed  so  that  the  students  discover  that  they  need  to  learn  some  new\nknowledge before they can solve the problem. The Public Service Management\nProgram of Capitol University has moved toward this concept through its\nphilosophy, which maintains that learners must become active problem-solvers\nand problem-posers if they are to function adequately in authentic, real-world\nsettings. The goal is to learn to integrate theory and practice thoughtfully and\nreflectively. An emphasis on the importance of small-group settings encourages\nan  inquisitive  and  detailed  look  at  all  issues,  concepts,  and  principles\nsurrounding the problem, incorporating the three dimensions of the learning\nexperience, which operate simultaneously and interrelatedly.\n\nThe  functions  of  each  dimension  must  be  understood  for  a  better\nappreciation of this approach. The personal stance is anchored on how the\nindividual learner sees himself or herself in relation to the new learning context.\nAccording to Savin-Baden (1996), the personal stance encompasses the means\nby which the learner discovers, defines, and expresses the interplay between\nwhat he or she brings to, and takes from, the learning experience. The ways in\nwhich people speak about themselves and view their profession, their peers,\nthe facilitator, and the institution are within the conceptual framework of the\npersonal stance. If the learner is a civil service employee, then he or she places\nhimself or herself within the PBL environment in examining how being a\npublic servant interplays with the new learning experience. The way the learner\nsees himself or herself in relation to the work environment, including peers\nand the entire system, plays a vital role in dissecting the problem. In most\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n693\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\f694\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\ncases, this stance has to deal with the biggest share of the problem because in\nmost cases the student\u2019s experience is in conflict with the policy itself.\n\nThe  pedagogical  stance,  as  discussed  by  Barnett  (1994),  exposes  a\nparticular constraint because it is influenced by the students\u2019 prior learning\nexperience  and  learning  history.  The  concept  of  pedagogical  stance\nacknowledges  the  relationship  between  the  self  and  what  is  being  learned.\nTherefore,  the  pedagogical  stance,  for  some,  encompasses  the  notion  of\n\u201creflective knowing,\u201d whereby the student not only embraces knowing but\nalso queries it. Since public service management students come from various\noffices and have varied learning experiences, this is one issue that must be\ntackled.\n\nThe  interactional  stance,  on  the  other  hand,  as  presented  by  Barnett\n(1994), captures the way in which a learner interacts with others in a learning\nsituation. It refers to the relationships between students within the group and\nbetween groups of students. Thus, the interactional stance encompasses the\nway in which students interpret the way they as individuals, and others with\nwhom they learn, construct meaning in relation to one another. This needs to\nbe dealt with carefully in the PBL approach because the students\u2019 interpretation\nof the new learning depends on how they relate to the group.\n\nThe Process\n\nPBL  entails  a  process  in  which  the  problem  drives  the  learning. The\n\napproach applied in Capitol University follows this process:\n\n(cid:127) The learning content is introduced in the context of complex real-\nworld problems, in contrast with traditional teaching strategies, where\nthe concepts are usually presented in a lecture format. In other words,\nthe problem comes first.\nStudents are randomly assigned to small groups.\nStudents  in  the  small  groups  organize  their  ideas  and  previous\nknowledge related to the problems, and attempt to define the broad\nnature of the problem.\n\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127) Throughout  the  group  discussion,  students  raise  questions,  called\n\u201clearning  issues,\u201d  on  aspects  of  the  problem  that  they  do  not\nunderstand.\n\n(cid:127) The group records these learning issues.\n(cid:127)\n\nStudents are continually encouraged to define what they know and\nwhat they do not know.\nStudents rank the learning issues according to order of importance.\n\n(cid:127)\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n694\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\fThe Problem-Based Learning Approach: Issues and Concerns\n\n695\n\n(cid:127)\n\nStudents discuss what resources will be needed to find out more about\nthe learning issues, and where to find the information.\nStudents share research findings with their peers.\n\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127) When  the  groups  meet  again,  the  students  explore  the  previous\nlearning  issues,  integrating  their  knowledge  and  connecting  new\nconcepts to old ones.\n\n(cid:127) New issues continue to be defined as students progress through the\n\nproblem.\n\nIt should be noted that before students can gain some knowledge they\nmust first identify the problem. They are expected to ask themselves these\nquestions:\n\n(cid:127) What do I know about this?\n(cid:127) What is the problem?\n(cid:127) What solutions are possible?\n(cid:127) What criteria will I use to assess the solutions?\n(cid:127) What do we need to know?\n(cid:127) Who will collect which information?\n(cid:127) Where will we find such information?\n(cid:127) How can we gain access to such information?\n(cid:127) What other resources are needed to support the learning process?\n(cid:127) How can I teach my group members about this?\n(cid:127) How do I apply my new knowledge to solve the problem?\n(cid:127) What documentation is needed?\n(cid:127) What similar problems could I solve this way?\n(cid:127) How do I relate this to my work setting?\n(cid:127) How does this problem relate to others in my experience?\n(cid:127) What have I learned that could help me solve other related problems?\n\nThe Student\u2019s Responsibility\n\nUnlike other public administration or public service management classes\nthat follow the traditional learning style, students in a problem-based setting\nmust assume responsibility for their own learning. They should be able to\nidentify what information they need and what resources they will use to gain\nthat knowledge. The resources include books, journals, online resources, and\nother experts. Through this process students can design their learning to meet\nindividual  needs,  because  they  differ  in  knowledge,  experience,  and  career\naspirations.  Allowing  students  to  assume  this  responsibility,  under  faculty\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n695\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\f696\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nguidance, prepares them to become effective and efficient lifelong learners\u2014\nan  absolute  essential  in  a  profession  where  more  and  more  new  types  of\nproblems  and  new  information  continuously  surface.  Capitol  University\nencourages students to organize symposiums, forums, and congresses, with\nthe students themselves facilitating the programs, inviting experts, and also\nacting  as  paper  discussants  on  issues  related  to  an  identified  problem.\nSometimes they go out of the campus to visit organizations and industries to\nobserve  real-world  complexities  firsthand.  They  also  conduct  in-depth\ninterviews  with  government  officials  and  employees,  as  well  as  their\nconstituencies.  After  the  students  share  and  evaluate  the  information  they\nhave  gathered  from  the  various  learning  sources,  they  decide  if  they  need\nfurther information. If so, the research continues. If not, the students form a\nrecommendation.  PBL  sessions  also  involve  students  critiquing  the\nperformance of other group members and commenting on their own efforts.\nAt the end of each activity, the professor gives feedback to each group before\nthe  class  can  proceed  to  the  next  activity. What  the  students  have  learned\nmust be applied to the problem, which is analyzed again and then resolved. A\nclosing analysis of the learning and a discussion of the concepts and principles\nlearned  are  essential. This  means  that  before  completing  their  work  on  a\nproblem the students should reflect on what they have learned and determine\nif anything is missing in their overall understanding of the problem. Assessing\nthemselves and their peers at the end of the process allows them to reflect on\nhow their new learning relates to prior problems and prepares them for future\nproblems, besides providing colleagues with feedback. Such an assessment is\nan important skill in life and in their careers.\n\nAs  PBL  revolves  on  a  problem  in  focus,  students  learn  to  become\nproficient in problem analysis, hypothesis generation, and the generation of\nlearning issues that warrant further exploration.\n\nThe Teacher\u2019s Responsibility\n\nThe  faculty  is  the  central  variable  in  the  effective  implementation  of\nPBL. Instead of lecturing and transferring information to students, he or she\nbecomes both learning manager and coach.\n\nThe  teacher  selects  appropriate  problem  situations. The  selection  is\ncritical. The  teacher  must  also  ensure  that  appropriate  physical  resources,\nincluding library or electronic sources, are available. Because PBL represents a\nparadigm shift in learning new skills, the teacher must move from being the\n\u201csage on the stage\u201d to serving as a \u201cguide by the side.\u201d As a learning coach, the\nteacher observes the students, strengthens poor performance, and encourages\nappropriate performance.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n696\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\fThe Problem-Based Learning Approach: Issues and Concerns\n\n697\n\nGenerally the role of the professor comprises the following:\n\nFacilitating groups\nPreparing the structure of the course\nPreparing the problem\n\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127) Giving guidance\n(cid:127) Giving assessments\n(cid:127) Challenging students\nPreparing for the process (including the time and space requirements)\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\nSupervising the classroom\n(cid:127) Acting as resource person\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127)\n(cid:127) Evaluating students\n(cid:127) Giving feedback\n(cid:127) Redirecting the work\nInitiating discussions\n(cid:127)\n\nIdentifying dysfunctional groups\nPromoting good group dynamics\n\nExpertise  in  facilitating  learning  is  vital.  The  teacher  must  assist\ncollaborative  learning,  and  assess  and  encourage  students  through  their\nproblem-solving difficulties. In some instances, as is done in Capitol University,\nthe teacher can invite outside experts to provide supplementary knowledge.\nIn no case should the teacher dominate the learning process.\n\nFinally, the teacher helps the students generalize their learning. As students\ntalk about what they have learned while dealing with the problem situation,\nthe teacher helps them understand how that same knowledge and skill has\nbroader applications.\n\nConclusion\n\nApplying PBL in the public service management or public administration\nprogram  is  like  entering  into  a  new  learning  community.  PBL  generates  a\ndeeper understanding of the issues, and whatever learning is gained can be\napplied to the problem with reanalysis and resolution. More importantly, the\nprocess teaches new problem-solving skills that can be applied more generally\nin the students\u2019 lives and work setting.\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n697\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\f698\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nRerences\n\nBarnett, R. 1994.

Raagas1\n\nIntroduction\n\nUnless  the  students  in  our  Master  of  Public  Administration  (MPA)\nprogram are empowered, their potential for research in policy development,\npublic  management,  governance,  citizens\u2019  participation,  delivery  of  basic\nservices, program evaluation, and the like will remain undeveloped. Our MPA\ncurriculum provides instruction in the use of quantitative techniques of analysis\nin  policy  and  program  formulation,  implementation,  and  evaluation,  in\ndecision  making,  and  in  problem  solving.  Most  of  these  areas  require  the\ncollection  and  analysis  of  quantitative  data. These  requirements  are  being\naddressed  by  such  MPA  offerings  as  the  courses  in  statistics  and  research\nmethods for public administration. However, even after these two foundation\ncourses  and  the  major  public  administration  offerings,  MPA  students  still\nlack preparedness to undertake research.\n\nFor decades our tools and methods for teaching statistics and research in\nthe  MPA  program  were  coherent  and  potent,  but  they  could  be  hard  for\nbeginners to grasp, and difficult for nonexperts to use effectively. In my own\nuniversity, for example, the statistics course is taught as a first course in graduate-\nlevel statistics, usually more than a few years removed from any statistics course\ntaken, if at all, at the undergraduate level.\n\nCourses in statistics and research methods for public administration are\ngenerally  more  of  the  lecture  type,  focusing  on  the  important  practical\nimplications and interesting applications of these two courses, and ensuring\nthat  students  are  exposed  to  the  tools  essential  for  research  in  public\nadministration.  However,  fear  of  research  due  to  inadequacies  in  statistics\npersists  among  MPA  students,  especially  those  working  on  their  thesis\nrequirement. These are all evident to me from my years of work as a statistics\nconsultant and now coordinator of our public administration program.

In my meetings with other research and statistics\nprofessors, we all agreed on the merits of the lecture method in familiarizing\nMPA students with the basic concepts of statistics and research. These are not\nenough, though. We need to offer a course that would reinforce the current\nstatistics and research offerings of the MPA program and that would allow\nstudents to \u201cput it all together,\u201d as Hill (2003) pointed out.\n\nThis paper therefore describes a problem-based data analysis course for\nthe MPA program that would reinforce students\u2019 understanding of research\nand statistics in public administration. This course gives students practical\nexperience  by  focusing  on  actual  public  administration  studies  and  data\nanalysis.\n\nA Problem-based Data Analysis Course\n\nOverview of the Course\n\nThis course is primarily anchored in problem-based learning (PBL). A\nPBL course starts with research studies in public administration rather than\nwith the exposition of knowledge related to the discipline. These studies move\nstudents  toward  the  acquisition  of  knowledge  and  skills  through  a  staged\nsequence of problems in context, together with the associated learning materials\nand support from the faculty (Boud and Feletti 1991). These studies drive the\nprocess of learning; hence, the starting point of teaching problem-based data\nanalysis is a real research study in an area of public administration that students\nwish to learn more about. The PBL approach is expected to develop among\nstudents a set of competencies such as adapting to and participating in change,\ndealing with problems, making reasoned decisions in unfamiliar situations,\nand reasoning critically and creatively. MPA students can also develop more\ntheir critical thinking, teamwork, time management, information gathering,\nand  even  communication  skills  over  and  above  their  computing  skills\n(Hollingshed  2004).  All  these  are  vital  in  undertaking  research  in  public\nadministration,  not  only  for  one  country  but  also  considering  global\nperspectives. These aspects of the PBL approach as applied to the problem-\nbased data analysis course in the MPA program are summarized in Figure 1.\nIn  many  ways,  PBL  can  be  considered  as  an  implementation  of  the\nconstructivist model of learning. PBL marks a change in the understanding of\nthe learning process, from a transfer of information from teachers to students\nto social interaction and individual construction of knowledge. According to\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n700\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\fTeaching Problem-Based Data Analysis to Public Administration Students\n\n701\n\nFigure 1: The Problem-based Data Analysis Course as Reinforcement\nof Statistics and Research Methods in the MPA Program\n\nMPA\nStatistics\nCourse\n\nMPA\nResearch\nCourse\n\n(cid:88)\n\n(cid:88)\n\nTeaching-Learning\nMaterials\n(Manual/Sample\nReseach Studies)\n\nComputer Technology\n\nSelf-directed\nLearning\n\nGroup-based\nLearning\n\nthis model, people construct knowledge by making sense in terms of what\nthey already know. Constructivism, on the other hand, holds that people can\nunderstand only what they have constructed themselves (Leidner and Jarvenpaa\n1995). Learning is an active process where learners develop their own mental\nmodels. In fact, in PBL, the students\u2019 own questions, experience, formulations,\nand  conceptions  of  problems  serve  as  the  basis  for  learning.  Furthermore,\nPBL makes the group another important resource for the learning process,\nextending constructivism to include social interaction and collaboration among\nthe students in a group.\n\nThe success of the problem-based data analysis course depends greatly\non  the  accompanying  teaching  materials,  computer  technology,  and  the\neducator\u2019s capability. We created in-house materials to fit the course design in\ntandem  with  the  studies  conducted  on  policy  implementation. Teaching\nmaterials, such as the Operation Manual for Data Analysis, were prepared by\nthe  professors  who  teach  the  course. The  manual  combines  in  one  place\nexposure  to  a  research  problem  on  public  administration,  the  research\ninstruments,  instructions  for  encoding  responses,  computer  commands,\napproaches to analyzing the data sets according to the research problem, and\ninterpretation  of  results. Thus,  in  the  problem-based  data  analysis  course,\nmost  of  the  time  and  efforts  of  the  faculty  are  spent  before  the  course,\ndeveloping the teaching materials such as the sample research studies and the\nmajor reference material that will guide both the MPA students and the faculty\nin achieving the objectives of the course.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n701\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\f702\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nDevelopment of Cases and Course Materials\n\nIn preparing this course, I opted to use public administration research\nstudies  that  I  had  supervised  as  MPA  program  coordinator.  So  I  had  easy\naccess to the original data and insights into the investigators\u2019 reasons for doing\nthe studies and the problems they had while preparing and doing the studies.\nAnother consideration in the choice of the studies was their timeliness and\nrelevance to public administration in the Philippine setting. These research\nstudies were also rated above average in overall quality by the panel of examiners\nin our MPA program, adding credibility and importance to these studies in\nthe eyes of the public administration students.\n\nThe major reference material, in the form of a manual, blends a sample\nstudy  in  public  administration  and  the  use  of  spreadsheets  for  common\nstatistical computations. A problem-based data analysis course when based\non spreadsheets becomes more accessible to different types of students and\ndeepens students\u2019 understanding of the statistical tools needed for research in\npublic administration.\n\nThe manual introduces the sample study (its framework, the problems\nto be answered, the instruments used in the gathering of data, and the like)\nand  gives  in  great  detail  the  steps  involved  in  data  analysis  and  statistical\ncomputation, the requisite mouse clicks, and computer keystrokes.\n\nSpreadsheets and Statistics in Data Analysis\n\nThis course also relies heavily on computer technology, including the\nuse of the online databases of the university and spreadsheet manipulation.\nThe  spreadsheet  itself  is  a  laboratory,  one  that  presents  the  stages  of  a\ncalculation, showing much detail. If the calculation is incorrect, the spreadsheet\ngives clues as to what is wrong. This feature makes a spreadsheet a vehicle for\ninteractive learning.\n\nOne benefit of a spreadsheet is that it automates calculation. A spreadsheet\nprovides easy access to descriptive statistics and common statistical tests. For\nexample, after just a few clicks of the mouse and the use of the Excel \u201cadd in\u201d\nfeature, the statistics are all ready. Instead of spending much time on statistical\ncomputations, the students can now focus on the research itself and grapple\nwith the implications of the statistics for public administration and governance.\nStudents would then also be eager to sharpen their spreadsheet skills for\ntheir theses and other courses, as well as in their research activities in their\nrespective offices. Using spreadsheets for statistical computations speeds them\nup considerably and thus removes a major barrier to research. And with success\nin spreadsheet use come positive reinforcement, self-confidence, enthusiasm,\nand the ability to apply the new skills and knowledge in novel ways.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n702\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\fTeaching Problem-Based Data Analysis to Public Administration Students\n\n703\n\nOrganization of the Course\n\nThe practical implementation of PBL does, of course, vary. The model\nadopted for the data analysis course is a combination of \u201cself-directed learning\u201d\nand \u201cbase group\u201d sessions, where the students work in groups of five to seven\nto complete the course. As students pursue solutions to their assigned research\nstudies,  each  one  tends  to  assume  more  responsibility  for  his  or  her  own\nlearning.\n\nBefore each student or group of students starts to work on the required\ntasks,  the  faculty  gives  a  lecture  or  its  equivalent  to  set  the  borders  of  the\nsession and to make sure the students do not lose their way in the research\nstudy. The  lecture,  plus  a  demonstration  of  spreadsheet  manipulation  and\nunobtrusive facilitation, is to guarantee that the students cover the relevant\nmaterial for the course.\n\nThe problem-based data analysis course follows the prescribed 48 class\nhours in a semester. It is divided into 16 3-hour sessions. More than half of\nthe time, the students are left to themselves; however, the faculty and students\ndo meet for seven sessions, distributed as follows:\n\n(cid:127) Orientation on the course and introduction to public administration\nresearch studies to familiarize the students with the objectives and\nbackground of the research study and other pertinent information (1\nsession).\n\n(cid:127) Demonstration of data encoding on spreadsheets and generation of\n\ndescriptive statistics and test statistics (2 sessions).\n\n(cid:127) Evaluation  of  students  (1  session  midway  through  the  term  and\n\nanother at the end of the semester).\n\n(cid:127) Demonstration of presentation of research outputs using PowerPoint,\nhyperlinks, and online databases to bring out research insights and\nimplications (1 session).\nStudent presentation of research outputs and critique of presentations\n(1 session).\n\n(cid:127)\n\nThe first discussion is aimed at understanding the research study. Students\nare led to recognize how the research questions, the kind of data gathered, and\nthe  research  design  influence  the  selection  of  statistical  methods.  The\nassumptions underlying various statistical methods and ways of testing these\nassumptions  are  reviewed  and  considered.  The  faculty  also  demonstrates\nspreadsheet  manipulation  for  statistical  computations,  complete  with  the\nrequisite mouse clicks and keystrokes on the computer.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n703\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\f704\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nThe  students  use  the  remaining  nine  sessions  to  analyze  the  research\nstudy  assigned  to  them. They  have  the  option  to  do  the  task  initially  by\nthemselves and then in groups so that they can meet the deadlines. If they\nhave short questions, they can send these by e-mail or text messages to the\nfaculty.\n\nExperience with the Course\n\nEvaluation\n\nThis course has been presented for six semesters in our MPA program,\nwith class size varying from 10 to 14 students. All the students had taken the\nrequired courses in statistics and research methods before this course. Almost\nall had very minimal knowledge of how to navigate spreadsheets, and average\nfamiliarity with the internet and word processing.\n\nThe  MPA  students  enrolled  in  our  university  work  full  time  in\ngovernment agencies and local government units, and, like other professionals\nworking toward a graduate degree, have considerable personal and professional\nconstraints on their time spent in school. With the problem-based approach\nto  teaching  data  analysis,  students  have  time  options  for  their  learning\nexperience. They  can  even  work  at  home,  since  the  computer  technology\nrequirement is very minimal.\n\nThe results of a brief evaluation of the course are shown in the table.\nThere is a general trend in the students\u2019 appreciation of the course, particularly\nin the integration of statistics, research, and computer technology. However,\nthe results indicate difficulty in achieving better time management. This is\nvery  evident  among  the  students  who  found  it  difficult  to  use  the  online\ndatabases of the university. This activity needs time to sift through the materials.\nThe statistical computations, however, posed no problem because most of the\nstudents have personal computers at home or laptop computers.\n\nAfter  the  course,  most  of  the  students  consulted  me  concerning  the\nanalysis  of  data  for  their  theses. They  displayed  less  statistics-anxiety  than\nother students who had not taken the course. When consulting me, these\nother students would begin with \u201cMa\u2019am, I am very poor in statistics; do you\nthink I can finish the thesis requirement?\u201d or, worse, \u201cIs there anybody you\ncan recommend who will analyze my data for a fee?\u201d\n\nThose who had taken the course in problem-based data analysis, on the\nother hand, tended to focus more on the research itself and to seek confirmation\nthat the statistical tools they were using were the most appropriate. This is a\nbig  improvement  on  the  very  extensive  and  time-consuming  research  and\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n704\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\fTeaching Problem-Based Data Analysis to Public Administration Students\n\n705\n\nResults of Evaluation of the Problem-based Data Analysis Course\n\n(No. of Respondents = 34)\n\nComments\n\nScope of Evaluation\n\n1.

There is also better appreciation of the usefulness of\ncomputer technology in research activities.\n\nChallenges\n\nThe problem-based data analysis course was not without its challenges.\nMost of the students needed more than the prescribed time to take complete\nresponsibility for investigating all the learning issues related to their research\nstudies\u2014particularly public administration theories; computer manipulation\nfor the required statistics, graphs, and tables; and use of the university\u2019s online\ndatabases.\n\nThe faculty also spent time answering short queries sent by the students\nthrough e-mail or text messages. Otherwise, the faculty met the students a\ngroup  at  a  time  to  provide  essential  supplementary  information  without\nencouraging passive student behavior.\n\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nOur experience suggests that the use of well-prepared teaching materials\nand  actual  studies  in  public  administration  in  conjunction  with  common\nstatistical software helps overcome the traditional barriers to the teaching and\nlearning of statistics and research methods in public administration.

The\nmain  academic  subjects  in  this  field  usually  give  the  basic  historical  and\ninstitutional  context  of  personnel  administration,  recruitment,  human\nresources selection, compensation, training and development, and appraisal.\nClasses in this field not only present learners with concepts related to human\nresources management in public agencies but also encourage learners to prepare\nfor the required competencies.\n\nProblem-based learning (PBL) is literally the problem comes first (Boud\n1985, Boud and Feletti 1991, and Woods 1985, as cited in White 1996).\nPBL involves several areas of concern. Unlike the traditional lecture method,\nin which only the instructor presents and discusses information (Savin-Badin\n2000,  as  cited  in  Samford  University  n.d.),  PBL  makes  the  instructor  a\nfacilitator of group process and learning.\n\nIntroducing  the  context  of  complex  real-world  problems  is  the  most\nessential  component  of  PBL. The  instructor  provides  the  students  written\ninformation to study before class. With this information and the lecture given\nin class, students must come to grips with a problem and decide what to do\nabout it. To solve problems, students must identify what they know and what\nthey do not know, and must learn by working either individually or in small\ngroups.  PBL  does  not  look  for  students  to  give  simple  answers  to  those\nproblems.  Students  should  try  to  go  in  depth  and  may  pursue  knowledge\nfrom other resources instead of the textbook and discuss the problem in group\nmeetings (Savin-Badin 2000, as cited in Samford University n.d.).\n\nPBL gives students opportunities to focus on identifying learning issues\napplicable to the resolution of problems during the learning process. Laying\nemphasis on critical thinking skills, understanding, and the ability to learn\nhow to learn and work cooperatively with others, the PBL approach, if applied\n\n1 Associate Professor, Department of Public Administration, Tamkang University, Taipei,China.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n709\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\f710\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nsuccessfully, can energize learners and catalyze institutional reform in education\n(Samford University n.d.).\n\nThe distinction between PBL and other forms of learning is often unclear\nbecause they share common features (White 1996). The difference between\ncase-based and problem-based learning is particularly difficult to ascertain.\nFor the case-based format, the students are provided with written case histories\nbefore the lecture and an in-class discussion about content and concepts follows.\nPBL focuses more on problems than cases, and more on what students do,\nrather than what the faculty does (MacDonald and Issacs 2001, as cited in\nSamford University n.d.).\n\nThe Assessment Center has been adopted in human resources selection\nand development in both public and private organizations. Assessment Center\nsimulation is broadly applied because of its reliability and validity. In its earlier\nstage, the Assessment Center focused on the purpose of selection. Recently,\nthe Developmental Assessment Center (DAC), which provides assistance in\nindividual career development, was established as the contemporary trend of\nthe Assessment Center. After job analysis, the establishment of a competency\nmodel, and the collection of critical incidents related to the target position,\nsimulated exercises are designed and these serve as the assessment tools. During\nsome  exercises,  assessors  observe  trainees\u2019  behavior  and  performance,  and\nprepare the reports on the results after a meeting among the assessors. Multiple\nexercises  give  opportunities  for  trainees  to  demonstrate  the  range  of  their\nabilities by experiencing a variety of simulated exercises, which represent various\nmanagerial issues that managers may face in the workplace. Thus, the exercise\ngives trainees opportunities for PBL.\n\nThis research is on the application of the in-basket exercise, Leaderless\nGroup  Discussion  (LGD),  and  written-analysis  exercise\u2014the  simulation\nexercises  commonly  used  in  the  Assessment  Center\u2014as  instructional\ninstruments in the Public Personnel Management course. The field study was\nconducted  among  students  currently  enrolled  in  Master  in  Public\nAdministration (MPA) programs in Taipei,China to probe into the effects of\napplying these simulation exercises in the MPA programs. This article provides\nrecommendations  based  on  the  results  of  the  field  study,  to  introduce\nAssessment Center simulation as a part of integrated instructional methods to\nmake learning more effective and to improve the problem-solving abilities of\npublic managers.\n\nLiterature Review\n\nPopularly applied in Western countries, the Assessment Center is a set of\nmeasurement instruments. The idea of the Assessment Center is to apply several\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n710\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\fAssessment Center Simulation as a Problem-Based Learning Tool for the MPA Program\n\n711\n\nmeasurement tools to assess candidates\u2019 knowledge, skills, and abilities. The\ndimension for the assessment is set according to the goal of the human resources\nselection. During the assessment, candidates have opportunities to display\ntheir  knowledge,  skills,  and  abilities  by  making  decisions  in  the  simulated\nsituations. Trained  assessors  observe  the  assessment  process. They  observe\ncandidates\u2019 behaviors and determine candidates\u2019 grades during the meeting of\nassessors. They  then  decide  the  suitability  of  the  candidates  for  the  target\npositions (Huang 2004).\n\nThe Assessment Center is designed according to the job analysis, which\ndetermines the core competencies needed for certain jobs. The assessment\nassumes  that  only  candidates  with  certain  capacities  can  accomplish\norganizational goals and missions effectively. Thus, these core competencies\nare adopted in the assessment design and dimension. This kind of human\nresources method has the following advantages: (i) the content of the assessment\nis  compatible  with  the  real  task  of  the  target  position,  ensuring  a  valid\nassessment;  and  (ii)  the  core  competencies  are  the  dimension  for  the\nrecruitment, ensuring that the recruited staff bring their knowledge and skills\ninto full play effectively in their work. The most frequent assessment tools are\nthe  in-basket  exercise,  written-analysis  exercise,  LGD,  interview,  and  oral\npresentation (More and Unsinger 1987).\n\nThe  in-basket  exercise  is  the  most  popular  assessment  tool  in  the\nAssessment Center. It measures the candidates\u2019 ability to solve problems, make\ndecisions, and develop ideas. A complete in-basket exercise has three parts:\nscenario  introduction,  the  exercise  proper,  and  relevant  resources  and\ndocuments. The scenario usually includes a plot, an organizational chart, an\nemployee task list, and mail, e-mail, and other messages and memos such as\nfinancial reports, project schedules, and task reports from subordinates. During\nthe  exercise,  candidates  play  a  member  of  the  organization  and  deal  with\nproblems in a given situation. The exercise procedure and scoring dimension\nare introduced to candidates before the exercise. They must read the provided\ninformation during the exercise and decide which cases should have priority\nand which ones can wait. Then they are required to write down the handling\nprocedure such as setting priorities, authorizing others to deal with a certain\ncase, creating message reply and forward lists, and summarizing solutions to\neach problem, including the decision made, responsibilities delegated, plans,\nand procedure for evaluating progress.\n\nA  traditional  in-basket  exercise  usually  has  the  candidates  working\nindependently, after which they are interviewed about their actions by the\nassessors  and  then  graded.  Recently,  the  practice-and-assess  method  of  in-\nbasket exercise has changed because of the effects of the internet and the popular\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n711\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\f712\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nSituational Judgment Test (SJT). For instance, some in-basket exercises now\ntend to be multiple-choice and require candidates to answer questions on a\ncomputer. Most cases have been modified into e-mail format. A computer\nprogram automatically calculates the scores of each candidate for the different\nabilities. Thus, the role of assessor in the in-basket exercise is gradually becoming\nmore minor (Huang and Cheng 2004).\n\nThe  written-analysis  exercise  tests  the  candidates\u2019  practical  ability.\nCandidates are given a paragraph describing problems faced by an organization.\nThey must then figure out solutions and sketch out operational plans and\nmethods.\n\nLGD divides candidates into groups, each one with five to six members.\nWithout  an  appointed  leader  for  the  group,  each  group  member  gets  the\nsame opportunities for participation and presentation. There are two types of\ngroup discussion. In the first one there are no appointed roles for the group\nmembers. This type of exercise emphasizes candidates\u2019 team dynamics. The\nother type of group exercise appoints roles for all the group members and tests\neach individual\u2019s ability.\n\nThe oral presentation includes presentation in formal meetings, informal\npresentation to managers, and focus groups. Candidates are given a job-related\nsubject and are given time to prepare before presentation. The assessors are\nthe audience. After the presentation, the candidate must answer questions\nfrom the assessors.\n\nIn the interview exercise, the interviewer usually plays the candidate\u2019s\nmanager and questions the candidates about one or several job-related issues.\nThe interviewer can be someone familiar with the position, not necessarily\nthe assessor. The assessors can observe the whole interview process from the\nother room or by camera.\n\nOther assessment tools are also used in the Assessment Center depending\non the needs of the position. For instance, to measure managerial ability the\nmanagement  exercise  often  simulates  departmental  meetings  where  the\ncandidate plays the top manager and has to deal with difficult issues. The\nprogress of the meeting is usually videotaped and reviewed by assessors to see\nif  the  candidate  is  capable  of  being  a  leader  and  displays  his  or  her\ncommunication  ability,  influence  on  others,  flexibility,  planning  ability,\ncreativity, and judgment under pressure and limited time (More and Unsinger\n1987).\n\nIn recent years, time and cost considerations have led to the scaling down\nof these work sample tests into simplified tests like the SJT, in written-exam\nformat. The  SJT,  which  used  mostly  multiple-choice  questions,  made  the\nassessment less complex (Huang and Cheng 2004).\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n712\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\fAssessment Center Simulation as a Problem-Based Learning Tool for the MPA Program\n\n713\n\nExercise Design and Arrangements\n\nAccording  to  the  process  and  method  of  the  Assessment  Center,  the\nauthor  edited  teaching  materials  from  public  administration  activities,\nincluding the most common tasks for public personnel administrators such as\nhandling  official  documents,  interviewing  candidates  for  promotion,  and\nholding  meetings. This  study  therefore  chose  the  following  three  types  of\nsimulated exercises that are commonly used in the Assessment Center: in-\nbasket exercise, interview exercise, and LGD exercise. (For the competencies\ncovered by each exercise, see the appendix.)\n\nExercise Planning\n\nThis study looked into the feasibility of applying each type of exercise in\nclass instruction. The instructor played the role of assessor. MPA students\ntaking  the  Seminar  on  Public  Personnel  Administration  class  at Tamkang\nUniversity played the candidates. Instead of grading candidates according to\ntheir  actions  right  after  the  exercise,  the  teacher  recorded  the  exercise  and\nwatched the videotape after class, evaluated the students\u2019 performance, and\ngave the students suggestions for their future learning.\n\nThe interview exercise allowed the students to experience the interview\nprocess firsthand and practice their interview skills. Also, by playing the role\nof applicant, the students were able to practice how they might answer the\nquestions asked. The first LGD exercise was a performance evaluation exercise.\nStudents  decided  as  \u201ccommittee  members\u201d  how  to  select  outstanding\nemployees.  Compensation  grading  is  a  significant  component  of  public\npersonnel administration. The second LGD exercise therefore required the\nstudents to evaluate six job positions using the point system, and to decide\nthe points for each position after discussion.\n\nConduct of the Exercise\n\nIn-basket Exercise. The students were given a description of the exercise,\nan organization chart, a work calendar, and other documents. They were asked\nto play a new personnel manager of a local government. The \u201cnew manager\u201d\nhad to deal with all the documents on the desk on the very first day on the\njob,  using  personnel  administration  skills  related  to  selection,  training,\nemployment, promotion, compensation, and insurance. In view of the limited\ntime,  there  were  only  12  documents  in  the  in-basket  of  the  \u201cpersonnel\nmanager.\u201d The procedure was as follows:\n\n(cid:127) The instructor presented the scenario for the exercise.\n(cid:127) The  students  wrote  notes  regarding  actions  to  be  taken  on  the\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n713\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\f714\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\ndocuments and affixed the notes onto the 12 exercise materials\u2014all\nwithin 60 minutes.\n\n(cid:127) The  instructor  guided  the  students  in  discussing  the  process  of\n\nhandling each document.\n\nInterview Exercise. The interview exercise simulated the selection of a\nhuman resources planning commissioner for a local government. The instructor\nplayed  the  applicant,  and  the  students  played  the  personnel  manager  and\nother recruitment staff. The procedure was as follows:\n\n(cid:127) The  students  read  the  job  description  for  the  position  of  human\nresources planning commissioner and the personal data and r\u00e9sum\u00e9\nof the applicant. Then they discussed the questions they wanted to\nask during the interview.\n\n(cid:127) The students were divided into groups and alternately took charge of\n\nthe interview.\n\n(cid:127) The instructor guided the students in reviewing the interview process\n\nand provided pointers about the selection interview.\n\nLGD I: Promotion Review Committee. The promotion review exercise\nsimulated the annual selection by a local government of its top performer.\nThe exercise materials included descriptions and data information about each\ncandidate from each sector. The students played members of the Promotion\nReview Committee and discussed how promotions were to be distributed.\nThe procedure was as follows:\n\n(cid:127) The instructor guided the students through the reading of the materials\nand  gave  them  sample  arguments  and  defense  strategies  for  the\nsimulated committee meeting.\n\n(cid:127) The discussion was divided into two stages. First, the students played\nunspecified roles as members of the committee. All of them gave fair\nand objective reasons for choosing a certain candidate. Second, the\nstudents  were  assigned  different  roles.  Each  one  played  the  sector\nmanager  of  one  of  the  candidates  and  fought  for  the  candidate\u2019s\npromotion, for the honor of the sector.\n\n(cid:127) The  instructor  guided  the  students  in  reviewing  the  process  of\ndiscussion and gave them more information on the procedure of the\nmeeting and the role of the personnel manager.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n714\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\fAssessment Center Simulation as a Problem-Based Learning Tool for the MPA Program\n\n715\n\nLGD II: Human Resources Development Committee. Students played\nmembers  of  the  Human  Resources  Development  Committee  of  a  local\ngovernment. They had to prepare job evaluations for six clerks according to\nthe main tasks of the clerks and other basic information. The grading format\nwas modified from Kelly and Whatley (1977). It included 11 evaluation factors,\neach divided into six grades. The procedure was as follows:\n\n(cid:127) The students read the exercise materials and evaluated the employees\n\naccording to the designed evaluation format.\n\n(cid:127) The  students  elected  a  \u201cchairman\u201d  among  themselves  before  the\n\ndiscussion.\n\n(cid:127) The \u201cchairman\u201d listed the grading results of each \u201ccommittee member\u201d\non the board. Then the \u201ccommittee\u201d eliminated those with unanimous\nresults  and  discussed  only  those  about  whom  the  \u201ccommittee\nmembers\u201d disagreed.\n\n(cid:127) The instructor guided the students in reviewing the evaluation process\nand showed them how job evaluation is related to position ranking\nand compensation.\n\nDiscussions and Recommendations\n\nReview of the Process\n\nGenerally, the students had positive impressions of the exercises applied\nin class. They thought these lifelike activities made the curriculum interesting,\nhelped them understand \u201creal life\u201d personnel administration, and made them\naware of the managerial skills they needed to improve. However, some parts\nof each exercise must be improved. For instance, given the limited time, the\nstudents  only  had  individual  exercises  and  no  group  discussion  in  the  in-\nbasket exercise. They thus missed out on opportunities to share opinions and\nexperiences.\n\nIn  the  interview  exercise,  although  the  students  prepared  and  listed\ninterview questions before the exercise, asking questions along the list deprived\nthe  interview  process  of  easy  and  smooth  progression  and  created  an\nuncomfortable atmosphere. Also, the instructor who played the applicant was\nusually interview-savvy enough to switch roles with the interviewer and lead\nthe interview.\n\nIn the Promotion Review Committee exercise, student attention first\ncentered  on  selection,  instead  of  the  appraisal  standards. Then  when  the\nstudents played the part of sector managers of the candidates, conflicts or\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n715\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\f716\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\narguments in behalf of the candidates were rare because the students lacked\nempathy with them. In other words, these \u201csector managers\u201d seldom fought\nfor their subordinates.\n\nIn the Human Resources Development Committee exercise, for lack of\nunderstanding of the purpose and methods of job evaluation, the students\ncould only grade the candidate according to the designed evaluation format.\nIn the discussion after the exercise, the students found two major problems\nwith the job evaluation exercise: it provided unclear grading dimensions, and\nthe \u201ccommittee members\u201d had different grading standards.\n\nExercise: Bridge between Theory and Practice\n\nThere are always differences and gaps between theory and practice. The\nacademic  circle  complains  that  the  pragmatists  give  too  much  weight  to\ninsignificant details. The pragmatists, for their part, claim that the academic\ncircle talks only about theories and does not teach useful ideas for practical\ntasks. J. W. McGuire believes that managerial theories and ideas lack surprising\nbreakthroughs and rarely make further progress\u2014the so-called failure of theory\n(Glueck 1985). To solve real-life problems, the pragmatist continually pursues\nmore  meaningful  theories  to  explain  and  predict  what  takes  place  in\norganizations.\n\nWhen analyzing managerial behavior, Mintzberg (cited in Glueck 1985),\npointed  out  that  terms  as  organization,  coordination,  and  control  do  not\ndescribe real management. These are just abstract words that scholars use to\ndescribe the management that they do not know.\n\nThus, from the teaching standpoint, instructional theories and concepts\ngive students basic knowledge, while the exercise materials help them check\ntheir knowledge against real-world situations. Exercise materials give newly\nemployed personnel administrators an overall view of personnel administration\nand help them become familiar with their tasks in a short time. And personnel\nmanagement knowledge provides them with concepts that they can use to\nmake changes in the system. Therefore, these two teaching methods, when\ncombined, help cultivate institutional innovators, instead of routine followers.\n\nExercise Method of Teaching\n\nGroup  exercises  have  been  applied  in  management  classes  for  years.\nTaiwanese psychologists as Jing-Ji Wu and Mu-Lan Shu have made significant\ncontributions to this field. Using case studies also achieves good results in business\nmanagement teaching. The exercises in this study focused on public personnel\nadministrators and strove to use real-world situations, to mold students into\npersonnel managers with the requisite knowledge, skills, and abilities.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n716\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\fAssessment Center Simulation as a Problem-Based Learning Tool for the MPA Program\n\n717\n\nDuring  the  role-playing  exercise,  the  students  found  it  difficult  to\ncompletely  get  into  the  part. They  knew  each  other  so  well  that  they  had\nproblems pretending to be other people. The instructions were also unspecific.\nAnd the students often needed to make assumptions during the discussion.\nThe exercises should contain more relevant information and encourage the\nparticipants to plunge more readily into the role playing.\n\nThe  purpose  of  the  LGD  exercise,  on  the  other  hand,  is  to  have  the\nparticipants interact with each other in more unstructured situations than in\nother  exercises. Through  the  interaction,  students  express  their  knowledge\nand skills in different aspects. A student with leadership skills might lead the\ngroup during the discussion.\n\nMost students, however, rarely shared their opinions especially at the\nstart of the discussion. During the discussion, most gave their opinions but\nseldom questioned the opinions of others. This reserve may have to do with\nthe traditional emphasis on harmonious relationships in Chinese culture. Thus,\nwhen  arranging  roles  for  an  exercise,  teachers  must  increase  the  potential\nconflicts between roles to stimulate discussion.\n\nThe exercises nonetheless made the students realize that they did not\nknow  enough  about  organizations  or  personnel  administration  laws  and\nregulations. During the Promotion Review Committee exercise, for example,\nstudents found themselves unfamiliar with the meeting procedure. The Human\nResources  Development  Committee  exercise,  on  the  other  hand,  required\nstudents to improve their understanding of compensation theory. The exercise\nmethod of teaching can therefore be a useful tool for evaluating learning.\n\nRelationship between Instructors and Students\n\nExperience-based learning emphasizes that learning is every participant\u2019s\nresponsibility. The instructor only guides and assists. This study found that\nstudents still rely too much on the instructors during the learning process.\nStudents  pointed  out  that  during  the  discussion,  without  the  instructor\u2019s\nexplanation, some of them could not agree or decide which opinion was right\nor wrong. Most students obviously thought that only the information that\ncame from the instructor was right.\n\nSome students believed that the exercises during the class helped them\nthink about the subject. Instead of receiving the answers from the instructors,\nthe students spent time and effort on the learning process before they obtained\nthe final outcomes. The students also believed that the situations they dealt\nwith in the exercises mirrored real-life situations in their future tasks.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n717\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\f718\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nTo the instructor, discussion was just a way to get students interested. It\nhas to be used in coordination with references and assigned reading from the\ntextbooks so that this teaching method can really benefit the students.\n\nLimitations of the Study\n\nConstrained  by  limited  time  and  resources,  this  study  arranged  only\nfour exercises, which did not touch on all personnel administration activities.\nIn  the  future,  teaching  materials  in  other  significant  topics  in  personnel\nadministration, such as human resources planning, training and development,\nperformance appraisal, and labor-management disputes, should be included.\nAnd the purpose of each exercise\u2014for instance, the abilities and skills for a\ngiven job that students can expect to learn\u2014must be clearly defined according\nto the job analysis.\n\nThe lectures should be supplemented with exercises. The lecture and the\nexercises should be coordinated to improve learning. Also, the lecture should\ncontain  both  basic  theories  and  relevant  laws  and  regulations,  and  their\nexplanations  and  examples,  so  that  the  students  can  understand  how  the\norganization relates to its environment.\n\nFurthermore, this study did not discuss instructional evaluation. Future\nstudies on this teaching method should deal with both the quality and quantity\nof learning. The success of the method cannot be determined by numbers or\ngrades on questionnaires or tests but through sustained, long-term observation\nand  interaction  between  the  instructor  and  students.  Case  studies  may  be\nprepared to help determine the success of the teaching method.\n\nConclusion\n\nPBL  allows  the  students  to  find  the  answers  to  problems  themselves\ninstead of receiving the answers from the instructor. The Assessment Center\nmethod  attempts  to  create  problems  by  designing  exercises,  and  requires\nstudents to find the answers through interaction. In the process, the students\nmay find the underlying problems.\n\nStudents benefit from this kind of exercise by discussing and sharing\ntheir experiences. Exchanging experiences promotes originality in students\nand encourages them to think as a group. However, students often focus on\nindividual  experiences  during  the  discussion  and  ignore  the  fundamental\nproblems. The composition of the group should be made more varied so that\nstudents not only benefit by sharing their experiences but also accomplish the\nobjective of the exercise.\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n718\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\n\fAssessment Center Simulation as a Problem-Based Learning Tool for the MPA Program\n\n719\n\nAnother problem encountered during these exercises is that some students\nharangue and strut their own experiences instead of spending time reading\nresearch publications. They neglect research results on the excuse that \u201ctheories\ncannot resolve practical issues.\u201d To lessen grandstanding, MPA instruction\nshould comprise four stages: reading, practice exercise, experience sharing,\nand discussion.\n\nWhether  recording  the  whole  exercise  and  keeping  the  videotape  for\nreview after class is time well spent and effective will be discussed in a future\nstudy.\n\nSession 7.pmd\n\n719\n\n22/11/2006, 9:11 AM\n\nNAPSIPAG\n\n\f720\n\nThe Role of Public Administration in Building a Harmonious Society\n\nReferences\n\nChang, K.
