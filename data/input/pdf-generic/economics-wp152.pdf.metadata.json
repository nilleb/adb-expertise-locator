Introduction\nThe global financial crisis that originated in the \ufffdnited States (\ufffdS) subprime mortgage \nmarket is now pummeling the real economy. As household and corporate sectors cut \nspending on tightened credit and reduced wealth, global recession has become almost \ninevitable. Output in all major industrial countries is expected to fall in 2009. The \nrecession will likely be deeper and more prolonged than originally expected, as it will take \ntime for the global financial system to stabilize and government expansionary policies to \ntake effect.\nThe global crisis has spread to Asia, affecting real economies and financial markets \nthroughout the region. The global financial turmoil and economic slowdown have reversed \ncapital flows and stunted export demand. Asia\u2019s output growth is decelerating given its \nclose ties to the global economy through both trade and financial links. A more protracted \nrecession and high volatility in G31 financial markets would have severe spillover effects \non Asia\u2019s economic outlook.  \nThe purpose of this paper is to empirically examine historical crisis episodes of Asian \neconomies to derive implications of the current global crisis for Asia. We first investigate \nbasic features of crisis episodes for 21 developing Asian economies during 1961\u20132007, \nproviding stylized facts on movements of key macroeconomic and financial variables \naround crisis episodes. We then consider how Asia\u2019s crisis episodes link to global crises \nto derive implications of the current global crisis on Asia.\nThere have been several studies assessing how the current global crisis will compare \nwith other past crises. Claessens, Kose, and Terrones (2008) provide extensive cross-\ncountry empirical analysis of past recessions that coincide with credit crunches, house \nprice busts, and equity price busts. Lall, Cardarelli, and Elekdag (2008) also provide a \nsimilar analysis, but focus on financial stress in banking, securities, and foreign exchange \nmarkets on economic activity. Reinhart and Rogoff (2008) focus on 18 bank-centered \nfinancial crises in industrialized countries since World War II. Barro and \ufffdrsua (2008) also \nlook at long-term historical data to analyze major economic crises. To date, we know of \nno systematic empirical research focusing on the stylized facts of economic and financial \ncrises in developing Asian economies, and the links of these crises with global financial \ncrises and recessions. This paper fills in this gap.\n\u0004  G3 includes European \ufffdnion, Japan, and \ufffdS.", "\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 15\u0018\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the data and methodology in \nidentifying crises; Section III provides various stylized facts on macroeconomic and \nfinancial crises in Asia; Section IV examines impacts of the \ufffdS/global crises on Asia,   \nand Section V concludes the paper.\nII. Data and Methodology\nA.   Data\nIn our analysis, we mainly investigate 21 developing Asian economies: the 10 Association \nof South East Asian Nations;2 Bangladesh; People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC); Hong \nKong, China; India; Kazakhstan; Republic of Korea (Korea); Kyrgyz Republic; Pakistan; \nPapua New Guinea; Sri Lanka; and \ufffdzbekistan. We exclude the Middle East and \ncountries with low data availability. The sample period is from 1961 through 2007 at its \nlongest and substantially shorter in many cases. For example, gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth rates for Cambodia are available for 19 years; 17 years for Kazakhstan; \nand 20 years for \ufffdzbekistan. We use unbalanced panel data to include as many \nobservations as possible.\nTo examine the impact of global shocks on Asian economies, we define the global \neconomy as represented by 21 industrial, mostly Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development (OECD) countries, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, \nDenmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New \nZealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, \ufffdnited Kingdom, and \ufffdS. This is \nthe reference set for our comparative analysis with Asian economies. \nAmong key variables, GDP and other variables from national income accounts are \nconsidered at the annual frequency because, for most Asian economies in our sample, \nnational income accounts data are available quarterly for only short periods of time. For \nprices and financial variables such as the consumer price index (CPI), domestic credit, \nand stock prices, we use quarterly series. When we need to combine the two sets of \ndata, we annualize quarterly data. National income accounts data are mostly from the \nWorld Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators and most of our financial variables are from \nthe International Monetary Fund\u2019s International Financial Statistics. \n2  Includes Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), \nMalaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam.", "Crises in Asia: Historical Perspectives and Implications  | 3\nB.   Definition of Recession\nWe define recessions based on \u201cclassical\u201d business cycles, which dates turning points \n(peaks and troughs) in the level of economic activity to separate periods of relative \nprosperity and relative decline. The concept of \u201cclassical\u201d business cycles was formalized \nby Burns and Mitchell (1946) and later implemented in algorithm by Bry and Boschan \n(1971) for monthly series and by Harding and Pagan (2002) for quarterly series. As our \ndata are either annual or quarterly, we first need to consider the Harding and Pagan \nalgorithm where for a quarterly series x, period t is defined as a trough if x < x , for k \nt t+k\n= -1, -2, 1, 2; and a peak if x > x , for k = -1, -2, 1, 2. A recession is naturally defined \nt t+k\nas the period immediately after a peak to the following trough. A censoring rule is also \nrequired to ensure that each cycle and each of its phases has a minimum duration. \nHarding and Pagan recommend setting the minimum duration for a single phase at two \nquarters and the minimum duration for a complete cycle at five quarters. \nHowever, as mentioned above, we use annual, not quarterly, series for GDP and other \nnational income account variables and thus modify Harding and Pagan\u2019s definition \naccordingly. When applied to annual series, their rule will imply that, for an annual \nseries x, period t should be defined as a trough if x < x , for k = -1 and 1, and a peak \nt t+k\nif x > x , for k = -1 and 1. In other words, any period (year) of negative growth can \nt t+k\nbe regarded as a recession. We apply this rule to our annual real GDP series to date \nrecession periods. Watson (1994) uses the same reasoning in his analysis of annual \ndata. It is clear that we do not need a separate censoring rule for annual series, because \na complete cycle (from peak to peak) will always take at least 2 years, which is greater \nthan five quarters.\nWe also follow Harding and Pagan in defining duration, amplitude, and cumulative loss \nof a recession. The duration is simply the length (number of years) of a recession, while \nthe amplitude measures the peak-to-trough fall in the logarithmic value of the series. \nThe cumulative loss is the sum of all losses from the peak value during the recession. \nAmplitude and cumulative loss both measure the severity of a recession. Figure 1 \nprovides an example. If the series in the figure represents the logarithm of GDP, the \nduration is given by 4 years (b), the amplitude 0.9 (a), and the cumulative loss 2.5 \n(=0.4+0.5+0.7+0.9).\nWe follow Claessens et al. (2008) and define severe recessions as those with the \namplitude belonging to the top quartile of the distribution.", "\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 15\u0018\nFigure 1: Definition of Recession, Duration, Amplitude, and Cumulative Loss\n3.6\n3.4\n3.2\nm\nh 3.0\narit a\ng\no 2.8\nal l\nur 2.6\nat\nN\n2.4 b\n2.2\n2\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nTime (year)\nC.   Definitions of Financial Downturns\nDownturns in the financial market, i.e., credit contractions and equity price declines, are \ndefined the same way: we examine domestic credit and stock price levels to determine \npeaks and troughs in each series. Similar to recessions, credit contractions and stock \nprice declines are defined as time periods between a peak and the following trough. \nWe deflate both domestic credit and stock prices by the CPI before dating peaks and \ntroughs. As both financial variables are available quarterly, we can directly use the Gauss \nalgorithm provided by Harding and Pagan. Once peaks and troughs are dated, the \nduration, amplitude, and cumulative loss can be defined the same way as before. Also, \nwe pick those severe downturns with the amplitude belonging to the top quartile of the \ndistribution for each credit contraction and stock price decline, considering them as credit \ncrunches and stock price busts, respectively.\nWhen changing the frequency of our indicator series from quarterly to annual, we classify \na whole year with any one or more quarters of contraction as a contractionary year. The \nduration, amplitude, and cumulative loss can be annualized in the same manner. We \nassign quarterly measures of the duration, amplitude, and cumulative loss to whichever \nyear the quarter belongs. For example, if there is a trough in the second quarter of \n1990, the duration, amplitude, and cumulative loss of that period are considered as the \ncorresponding measures for all of 1990.", "Crises in Asia: Historical Perspectives and Implications  | 5\nIII. Stylized Facts of Economic Crises in Asia\nA.   Descriptive Statistics on Recessions\nUsing the above dating methodology, we identify recessions, credit contractions, and \nstock price declines. Table 1 offers some descriptive statistics on recession episodes for \neach Asian economy in our sample. Claessens et al. (2008) provide an almost identical \ntable for OECD countries. The first column shows the proportion of time in recession that \nis defined as the number of recessionary years divided by the total number of years for \nwhich GDP data are available. The second column shows the average length (measured \nin number of years) of a recession episode. The third and the fourth columns indicate \nthe severity of recessions. As shown in the table, Asian countries on average were \nin recession about 13% of the time, and each recession lasted about 1.6 years. The \naccumulated decrease in GDP during a recession (cumulative loss) was about 12%.  \nTable 1: Descriptive Statistics on Recessions \nAll Recessions Severe Recessions\nCountry Proportion  Duration  Amplitude  Cumulative  Duration  Amplitude  Cumulative \nof Time in  (years) (%) Loss (%) (years) (%) Loss (%)\nRecession\n(%)\nBangladesh \u00040.64 \u0004.25 6.47 7.84 2.0 \u00049.45 24.93\nBrunei Darussalam 23.33 \u0004.4 7.44 9.\u00044 2.0 26.82 33.82\nCambodia \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of \u00040.64 \u0004.5 5.7 8.55 2.0 9.8 \u00045.5\nHong Kong, China 2.\u00043 \u0004.0 6.03 6.03 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nIndia 8.5\u0004 \u0004.33 2.74 3.55 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nIndonesia 4.26 \u0004.0 7.69 7.69 \u0004.0 \u00043.\u00043 \u00043.\u00043\nKazakhstan 35.29 \u0004.0 \u0004.9 \u0004.9 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nKorea, Rep. of 4.26 \u0004.0 4.\u00047 4.\u00047 \u0004.0 6.85 6.85\nKyrgyz Republic 33.33 2.33 20.97 62.33 5.0 62.7\u0004 \u000486.78\nLao PDR 7.4\u0004 2.0 3.64 5.\u00045 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nMalaysia 4.26 \u0004.0 4.24 4.24 \u0004.0 7.36 7.36\nMyanmar \u00047.78 \u0004.6 6.94 9.\u00044 2.5 \u00043.6 \u00049.08\nPakistan \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nPapua New Guinea 27.66 \u0004.86 3.63 5.57 2.0 7.67 \u0004\u0004.58\nPhilippines 8.5\u0004 \u0004.33 5.26 7.7 2.0 \u00044.63 2\u0004.95\nSingapore 8.5\u0004 \u0004.0 \u0004.3\u0004 \u0004.3\u0004 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nSri Lanka 4.26 \u0004.0 0.98 0.98 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nThailand 4.26 2.0 \u0004\u0004.88 \u00043.25 2.0 \u0004\u0004.88 \u00043.25\nUzbekistan 25.0 5.0 20.09 65.46 5.0 20.09 65.46\nViet Nam \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nAverage \u00043.33 \u0004.59 6.73 \u00042.44 2.29 \u00047.83 34.97\nUnited States \u00040.64 \u0004.25 0.76 0.88 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nG7 7.29 \u0004.\u00043 \u0004.28 \u0004.46 \u0004.50 3.0\u0004 4.04\nOECD 8.52 \u0004.32 \u0004.73 2.58 2.07 4.83 8.77\n\u2013 refers to nonavailability of data or such event.\nNote:   Severe recessions refer to recession episodes (including all economies) with the amplitude belonging to the top quartile of \nthe distribution. The cutoff value of the amplitude in classifying severe recessions is 6.85.", "\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 15\u0018\nAlso reported in the table are characteristics of severe recessions. According to the \ntable, a severe recession lasts for about 2.3 years on average and is associated with \ncumulative GDP loss of about 35%. This result is roughly consistent with Barro and \ufffdrsua \n(2008) for GDP disasters based on much longer historical data. As Table  6 in Section IV \nshows, the average duration of a GDP disaster is 2.9 years and the cumulative loss is \nabout 25%.3 \nThe same statistics are computed for OECD economies in order to provide a reference \npoint for comparison. We do not simply cite the results from Claessens et al. (2008) \nbecause their results are derived from quarterly data and thus are not directly comparable \nto our results. When using annual data, some of the GDP fluctuations at the quarterly \nfrequency are likely to be undetected or smoothed out. Indeed, a comparison between \nour statistics for OECD countries in Table 1 with the statistics by Claessens et al. (2008) \nconfirms that our recessions are less frequent and less severe than recessions defined \nfrom quarterly data. The proportion of time in recession and the amplitude of a recession \nfor OECD countries reported in Claessens et al. (2008) are 11% and 2.63%, respectively.\nIn our view, the most important pattern in Table 1 is the systematic difference between \nAsian economies and OECD countries in the duration and severity of recessions. While \nthere is substantial diversity in Asia, the table shows that on average recessions are \nmore often longer lasting and more severe in Asian economies than in OECD countries. \nClearly, Central Asian countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and \ufffdzbekistan \nexhibit extraordinary recession characteristics. The difference between Asia and OECD, \nhowever, is not solely driven by these countries. Even when these Central Asian \neconomies are excluded from the sample, recessions still appear to be more severe in \nAsia: the duration is 1.35 years, the amplitude 5.21%, and the cumulative loss 6.29%. \nThis suggests that Asian economies were more vulnerable to negative shocks. This \npattern is consistent with previous findings on business cycles of developing economies. \nMendoza (1995), Agenor, McDermott, and Prasad (1999), Neumeyer and Perry (2005), \nAguiar and Gopinath (2007) commonly find that GDP volatility is greater in developing \neconomies than in developed ones. One difference is that these studies consider not \nonly recessions but also expansions. Our paper considers only recessions as we are \nconcentrating on crisis episodes.\n3  With wartime periods excluded from the Barro and Ursua (2008) sample, the duration is 2.35 years and the \ncumulative loss is \u00049.36%. When Central Asian countries (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan) are \nexcluded from our sample, the duration of severe recessions becomes \u0004.75 years and the cumulative loss \u00046.75%. ", "Crises in Asia: Historical Perspectives and Implications  | 7\nB.   Descriptive Statistics on Credit Contractions  \n  and Stock Price Busts\nWe compute the same statistics for credit contractions and equity price declines for \neach economy, and report the results in Table 2. As credit contractions and equity price \ndeclines are identified from quarterly data, the duration here refers to the number of \nquarters between a peak and the following trough. As can be expected from the volatile \nnature of the financial variables, both credit and equity-price cycles exhibit a greater \nprobability of a downturn than the GDP cycle, although the duration, when translated \nto the annual frequency, is similar to that of GDP recessions. Also, the peak-to-trough \namplitude and the cumulative loss are much greater than those from GDP series. \nTable 2: Descriptive Statistics on Financial Downturns\nAll Credit Contractions Credit Crunches\nCountry Proportion  Duration  Amplitude  Cumulative  Duration  Amplitude  Cumulative \nof Time  (quarter) (%) Loss (%) (quarter) (%) Loss (%)\nin Credit \nContraction \n(%)\nBangladesh \u00047.05 5.0 5.66 \u00047.36 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nBrunei Darussalam 62.07 9.0 72.46 340.93 9.0 72.46 340.93\nCambodia \u00049.64 5.5 \u00048.07 5\u0004.68 7.0 22.05 67.94\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of \u00045.56 4.0 8.04 26.86 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nHong Kong 40.00 5.33 \u0004\u0004.38 40.29 7.0 26.\u00040 \u000400.34\nIndia \u00046.\u00045 3.5 7.6\u0004 \u00047.37 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nIndonesia 2\u0004.29 4.\u00043 36.79 82.20 3.67 77.\u00044 \u000454.82\nKazakhstan \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nKorea, Rep. of 7.\u00044 2.4 2.34 4.56\nKyrgyz Republic 30.00 4.33 32.\u00044 94.64 4.33 32.\u00044 94.64\nLao PDR 46.\u00045 4.50 29.50 7\u0004.67 5.67 43.48 \u0004\u00044.\u00040\nMalaysia \u00046.67 3.00 5.38 \u00042.77\nMyanmar 35.66 4.44 20.52 68.70 6.0 36.6\u0004 \u00043\u0004.05\nPakistan 20.83 4.44 \u00040.9\u0004 29.84 7.0 55.23 \u00047\u0004.79\nPapua New Guinea 43.80 9.33 27.79 230.52 \u00042.75 38.\u00048 339.98\nPhilippines 32.8\u0004 5.\u00047 \u00048.78 \u0004\u00044.97 \u0004\u0004.5 66.94 547.99\nSingapore 22.62 3.45 \u0004\u0004.78 29.42 2.0 35.5\u0004 52.95\nSri Lanka 22.40 3.58 \u0004\u0004.52 26.68 4.0 3\u0004.20 52.56\nThailand \u00048.75 8.33 \u00048.\u00049 \u000438.6\u0004 \u00048.0 32.37 374.99\nUzbekistan \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nViet Nam 7.69 2.0 2.0\u0004 3.5 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nAverage 26.\u00042 4.8\u0004 \u00048.47 73.82 7.53 43.80 \u000495.70\nUnited States 2\u0004.35 6.83 4.02 22.49 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nG7 \u00047.29 4.50 5.50 2\u0004.84 7.83 20.07 88.83\nOECD \u00047.42 4.36 7.3\u0004 27.64 7.0\u0004 \u00049.27 79.07\ncontinued.", "\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 15\u0018\nTable 2: continued.\nAll Stock Price Declines Stock Price Busts\nCountry Proportion of  Duration  Amplitude  Cumulative  Duration  Amplitude  Cumulative \nTime in Stock  (quarter) (%) Loss (%) (quarter)  (%) Loss (%)\nPrice Decline \n(%)\nBangladesh 5\u0004.25 6.0 66.67 542.44 \u00043.0 \u00049\u0004.73 \u0004987.53\nBrunei Darussalam \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nCambodia \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of 42.25 5.4 53.82 208.76 8.0 \u000425.94 468.25\nHong Kong 32.\u00044 4.33 43.38 \u000426.65 4.0 70.\u00046 \u000490.97\nIndia 47.40 7.0 37.60 2\u00044.5\u0004 \u00047.0 74.56 784.9\u0004\nIndonesia 40.00 5.0 6\u0004.07 227.\u0004\u0004 7.0 \u000428.\u00045 46\u0004.08\nKazakhstan \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nKorea, Rep. of 54.\u00047 7.22 5\u0004.79 283.09 \u00043.0 \u000406.72 648.3\u0004\nKyrgyz Republic \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nLao PDR \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nMalaysia 38.39 4.78 48.\u00044 \u000449.38 7.33 92.22 330.\u00042\nMyanmar \u2013\nPakistan 49.47 7.0 39.39 230.57 \u00049.0 \u000453.24 \u0004542.45\nPapua New Guinea 35.7\u0004 2.33 \u00042.89 26.03 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nPhilippines 58.33 \u00040.2 98.80 740.86 \u00042.83 \u000433.24 \u0004088.4\u0004\nSingapore 55.43 9.2 39.68 2\u00043.87 \u00040.0 82.65 279.09\nSri Lanka 62.79 \u00043.2 78.07 824.85 22.0 \u000443.40 \u00046\u00040.69\nThailand 43.\u00048 3.5 23.28 56.27 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nUzbekistan \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nViet Nam 57.\u00044 4.0 \u00043.76 38.49 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nAverage 47.69 6.37 47.74 277.35 \u00042.\u0004\u0004 \u0004\u00048.36 853.8\nUnited States 38.54 5.2\u0004 24.22 84.27 8.0 65.20 2\u00045.\u00047\nG7 42.85 5.88 33.55 \u000459.79 9.96 84.79 4\u00042.63\nOECD 43.02 6.64 38.47 207.66 \u0004\u0004.89 89.49 6\u00043.44\n\u2013 refers to nonavailability of data or such event.\nNote:   Credit crunches refer to credit contractions (including all economies) with the amplitude belonging to the top quartile of \nthe distribution.

The cutoff values of the amplitude in classifying credit crunches and stock price busts are 2\u0004.09 and 67.98, \nrespectively.\nWe examine severe financial downturns separately, though the same way we did for \nrecessions in Table 1. Credit contractions and stock price declines with the amplitude \nbelonging in the top quartile of the corresponding distributions are regarded as credit \ncrunches and stock price busts, respectively. According to the last three columns in \nTable 2, credit crunches and stock price busts involve not only greater losses but also \nlonger durations.\nSimilar to Table 1, Table 2 shows that there exist systematic differences between Asian \ndeveloping countries and OECD countries. Downturns in the financial market are more \nfrequent, longer-lasting, and more severe among Asian countries. This suggests that not \nonly the output market but also the financial market are more volatile in Asian economies \nthan in OECD countries.", "Crises in Asia: Historical Perspectives and Implications  | 9\nC.   Synchronization of Recessions, Credit Contractions,  \n  and Stock Price Busts\nRegional/global economic integration can make macroeconomic and financial fluctuations \ncoincide across economies. One simple approach to considering synchronization of \nevents is to examine their bunching in time. In Figure 2, we plot the proportion of \neconomies in recession, credit contraction, and stock price declines during 1960\u20132007, \nseparately for developing Asia and OECD. A clear pattern that emerges from Figure 2  is \nthat recessions are less synchronized among Asian countries. For OECD, the proportion \nof countries in recession exceeds 50% in a couple of incidents and equals zero in \nmany years. The high synchronization of recessions among OECD countries has been \nreported in Claessens et al. (2008) as well. For Asia, on the other hand, the proportion \nexhibits relatively small time-series variation, except during the 1997/1998 Asian financial \ncrisis. Our results suggest that Asian countries are not as homogenous or interrelated \nas OECD countries. A similar difference is observed between the two regions for stock \nprice declines. For OECD, the proportion of countries in stock price declines reaches \nas high as 100% on a few occasions and below 20% on several others. For Asia, the \nproportion reaches 100% only once during the Asian financial crisis since 1980 and never \nbelow 20% during the sample period. The high values of the series for earlier years \nare not reliable because the stock price data for that period are available only for a few \neconomies. It is not clear whether the two regions can be similarly distinguished in terms \nof synchronization of credit contractions. The time series variation in the proportion of \ncountries in credit contractions (measured by standard deviation) is greater for Asia, partly \ndue to the positive time trend apparent in the series since the 1990s. \nOftentimes a recession is accompanied or preceded by a financial downturn. For \nexample, the Asian crisis in 1997 was triggered by turmoil in the foreign exchange \nmarket. The current \ufffdS economic downturn was initiated by the subprime mortgage \ncrisis. The synchronization of real downturns and financial downturns is clearly observed \nin our data set as well. In particular, we find that credit contractions and stock price \ndeclines tend to concur with recessions while stock price declines tend to precede credit \ncontractions. As shown in Table 3, the correlation coefficient between recessions and \ncredit contractions in Asia is 0.19 and the correlation between recessions and stock price \ndeclines is 0.18. Credit contractions and one-year-lagged stock price declines are also \npositively correlated, with the correlation coefficient reaching 0.13. These correlations \nare all significant at the 5% level. In OECD countries, credit contractions tend to concur \nwith GDP recessions while stock prices tend to precede GDP recessions. According to \nthe lower panel of Table 3, the correlation between recessions and credit contractions in \nOECD is 0.24 and the correlation between recessions and one-year-lagged stock price \ndeclines is 0.17. This suggests that stock prices are more forward looking in OECD \ncountries. Stock price declines and credit contractions are weakly correlated with each \nother, either contemporaneously or with a lag.", "10 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 15\u0018\nFigure 2: Proportion of Economies in Recession, Credit Contraction, and Stock Price Decline (percent)\nRecession     \n      Asia                      OECD\n0.6 0.6\n0.5 0.5\n0.4 0.4\n0.3 0.3\n0.2 0.2\n0.1 0.1\n0 0\n1960 64 68 72 76 80 84 88 92 96 200004 08 1960 64 68 72 76 80 84 88 92 96 200004 08\nCredit contraction\n      Asia                      OECD     \n0.9 0.7\n0.8\n0.6\n0.7\n0.5\n0.6\n0.5 0.4\n0.4 0.3\n0.3\n0.2\n0.2\n0.1\n0.1\n0 0\n1960 64 68 72 76 80 84 88 92 96 200004 08 1960 64 68 72 76 80 84 88 92 96 200004 08\nStock price decline\n      Asia                      OECD\n1.2 1.2\n1.0 1.0\n0.8 0.8\n0.6 0.6\n0.4 0.4\n0.2 0.2\n0 0\n1960 64 68 72 76 80 84 88 92 96 200004 08 1960 64 68 72 76 80 84 88 92 96 200004 08", "Crises in Asia: Historical Perspectives and Implications  | 11\nTable 3: Correlations between Recessions, Credit Contractions, and Stock Price Declines\nA: Asia Recession Credit Contraction Stock Price Decline\nCredit Contraction 0.\u00049**\nStock Price Decline 0.\u00048** 0.02\nRecessiont-\u0004 0.30** 0.2\u0004** \u20130.06\nCredit Contraction t-\u0004 0.04 0.29** \u20130.2\u0004**\nStock Price Decline t-\u0004 0.\u00043** 0.\u00042** 0.\u00047**\nB: OECD Recession Credit Contraction Stock Price Decline\nCredit Contraction 0.24**\nStock Price Decline 0.04 0.06*\nRecessiont-\u0004 0.\u00047** 0.\u00044** 0.02\nCredit Contraction t-\u0004 0.\u00049** 0.38** \u20130.05\nStock Price Decline t-\u0004 0.\u00047** 0.07* 0.22**\n* and ** refer to \u00040% and 5% significance level, respectively.\nNote: Central Asian countries are included.\nD.   Recessions Associated with Financial Crises\nWhen an economy is hit by combined recession and financial downturn, one may expect \nthat the impact will intensify. This expectation is largely supported by Table 4, which \ncompares recessions that are in association with financial crises and those that are not. \nFollowing Claessens et al. (2008, 13), \u201cif a recession episode starts at the same time \nor after the beginning of an ongoing credit crunch or asset price bust\u201d, we consider the \nrecession to be associated with a financial crisis. Since sample means of the recession \ncharacteristics are sensitive to outlier observations, Central Asian countries are excluded \nin Table 4. The last two columns of Table 4 indicate that the peak-to-trough drop in GDP \nand the associated cumulative loss in GDP tend to be greater when the recession is \naccompanied by a credit crunch or a stock price bust.4 Similar patterns are observed for \nOECD countries.\nTable 4: Descriptive Statistics on Combined Recession and Financial Crises\nA: Asia Proportion of  Duration  Amplitude  Cumulative \nTime Spent (%) (years) (%) Loss (%)\nRecession + Credit Crunch 9.32 \u0004.3\u0004 7.36 8.65\nRecession + No Credit Crunch 7.26 \u0004.37 4.42 5.28\nRecession + Stock Price Bust 6.24 \u0004.\u00049 5.00 5.76\nRecession + No Stock Price Bust \u00042.37 \u0004.60 4.0\u0004 5.3\u0004\nB: OECD Proportion of  Duration  Amplitude  Cumulative \nTime Spent (%) (years) (%) Loss (%)\nRecession + Credit Crunch 3.65 \u0004.63 3.22 4.79\nRecession + No Credit Crunch  8.08 \u0004.26 \u0004.65 2.44\nRecession + Stock Price Bust  4.92 \u0004.33 \u0004.48 2.3\u0004\nRecession + No Stock Price Bust 4.92 \u0004.\u00043 \u0004.28 \u0004.62\nNote: Central Asian countries are excluded because sample means are sensitive to outlier observations.\n4  When Central Asian countries are included, mmeeddiiaann vvaalluueess eexxhhiibbiitt ssiimmiillaarr ppaatttteerrnnss..", "1\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 15\u0018\nFinancial crises may increase not only the severity of a recession but also the likelihood \nof a recession. In order to examine this possibility, Table 5 counts the frequencies \nof recessions and financial downturns and their joint events, and computes various \nconditional probabilities. Severe credit contractions and severe stock price declines \nin the table are the same as credit crunches and stock price busts as defined above, \nrespectively. The first row of Panel A of the table, for example, shows that the total \nnumber of credit contraction episodes in our sample is 115 and the total number of \nrecession episodes is 32. For consistency with Table 4, the joint event is defined as \na recession episode that starts at the same time or after the beginning of an ongoing \ncredit contraction. The conditional probability, computed as the number of the joint \nevents divided by the number of credit contractions, thus indicates there is about 19% \nchance of a recession for a given credit contraction episode. Similarly, the conditional \nprobability of 39% in the third row refers to the probability of a recession given that the \neconomy currently has a severe credit contraction. From these two rows, it is clear that \nTable 5: Frequencies of Recessions and Financial Downturns\nAsia\nA: Credit  Recession Frequency of Conditional \nContraction Credit  Recession Joint Event Probability\nContraction\nAll All \u0004\u00045 32 \u00047 0.\u00045\nAll Severe \u0004\u00045 8 4 0.03\nSevere All 27 32 9 0.39\nSevere Severe 27 8 2 0.09\nB: Stock Price  Recession Frequency of Conditional \nDecline Stock Price  Recession Joint Event Probability\nDecline\nAll All 98 \u00049 \u00048 0.\u00049\nAll Severe 98 5 5 0.05\nSevere All 23 \u00049 \u00042 0.52\nSevere Severe 23 5 4 0.\u00047\nOECD\nC: Credit  Recession Frequency of Conditional \nContraction Credit  Recession Joint Event Probability\nContraction\nAll All \u000432 59 34 0.26\nAll Severe \u000432 \u00046 9 0.07\nSevere All 33 59 8 0.24\nSevere Severe 33 \u00046 2 0.06\nD: Stock Price  Recession Frequency of Conditional \nDecline Stock Price  Recession Joint Event Probability\nDecline\nAll All 22\u0004 47 34 0.\u00045\nAll Severe 22\u0004 8 4 0.02\nSevere All 57 47 23 0.40\nSevere Severe 57 8 2 0.04\nNote:   Severe stock price declines are the same as stock price busts.

The total number of recessions is not the same between Panels A and B and between \nPanels C and D because the number of observations with both GDP and stock price data is smaller than the number of \nobservations with both GDP and domestic credit data.", "Crises in Asia: Historical Perspectives and Implications  | 13\nthe probability of a recession increases when domestic credit decreases more severely. A \nsimilar pattern emerges from the second and the fourth rows. The probability of a severe \nrecession increases from 3% to 9% as domestic credit decreases more severely. Panel B \nof the table repeats the computation for stock price declines. The total number of (severe) \nrecessions in Panel B is smaller than that of Panel A because the number of observations \nwith both GDP and stock price data is smaller than the number of observations with both \nGDP and domestic credit data. Panel B of Table 5 shows that the probability of a (severe) \nrecession increases when the stock price decreases more severely. The probability of a \nrecession is 19% conditional on stock price decline, and jumps to 52% conditional on a \nstock market crash. Likewise, the probability of a severe recession is 5% conditional on \nstock price decline, and 17% conditional on a stock market crash. \nOECD countries exhibit somewhat different patterns. As Panels C and D of Table 5 \nshow, the conditional probability of a recession in OECD countries, while increasing \nwith the severity of the stock price decline, is almost independent of the severity of the \ncredit contraction. This, combined with Table 4 results, suggests that credit contractions \nin OECD increase the severity of a recession but not particularly the likelihood of a \nrecession.\nE.   Adjustments in Macroeconomic and Financial Variables\nOur discussion thus far has focused mainly on movements of GDP during a recession. In \nthis subsection, we examine how various macroeconomic and financial variables change \naround a recession episode. Figure 3  plots the growth rate of each variable for 3 years \neach before and after a peak. The peak year is denoted by 0. For variables that are \navailable at quarterly frequencies (such as CPI, domestic credit, and the stock price), \nwe use the year-on-year growth rate of the fourth quarter. In order to avoid influence of \noutlier values, Central Asian countries are excluded.\nA prominent pattern in Figure 3  is that all components of GDP tend to move in the same \ndirection around a recession. For each component, the growth rate becomes negative \nin period 1 and resumes positive in period 2. Also, consistent with common expectation, \nfixed investment is most volatile, with the amplitude exceeding that of all the other \ncomponents of GDP. It appears that fixed investment is the first thing to cut when things \ngo bad. The least volatile component is consumption. Previous studies on business \ncycles of developing economies have often stressed that, unlike in developed countries, \nconsumption is more volatile than GDP in developing economies. Aguiar and Gopinath \n(2007), for example, find that \u201csmoothness\u201d of consumption is not observed among 13 \ndeveloping economies including Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand. In order to \nexplain the lack of consumption smoothness, they develop a hypothesis on the nature \nof underlying productivity shocks. According to Figure 3, however, the amplitude of the \nfall is smaller for consumption than for GDP. This suggests that, at least during GDP \nrecessions, consumption smoothing is present even among Asian economies.", "1\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 15\u0018\nFigure 3: Adjustments in Macroeconomic and Financial Variables around a Recession (percent)\nGDP growth Consumption growth\n7 8\n6 7\n5 6\n4 5\n3 4\n2 3\n1 2\n0 1\n-1 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 0\n-2 -1 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3\n-3 -2\n-4 -3\nFixed investment growth Export  growth\n20 15\n15\n10\n10\n5\n5\n0\n-5 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 0\n-3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3\n-10\n-5\n-15\n-20 -10\nImport growth Current account/GDP\n15 10\n8\n10\n6\n5 4\n2\n0 0\n-3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3\n-2\n-5\n-4\n-10 -6\nInflation Real credit growth\n25 16\n14\n20 12\n10\n15\n8\n6\n10\n4\n5 2\n0\n-3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3\n0 -2\n-3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3\nMean Median Current recession\ncontinued.", "Crises in Asia: Historical Perspectives and Implications  | 15\nFigure 3: continued.\nShare price growth\n60\n40\n20\n0\n-3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3\n-20\n-40\n-60\nMean Median Current recession\nNote: Period 0 refers to a peak.\nAlso shown in Figure 3 are adjustments in other macroeconomic variables and financial \nvariables. As the figure illustrates, the current account/GDP ratio improves during a \nrecession. On average, economies experience current account deficits prior to a peak and \ncurrent account surpluses after a peak. This is consistent with the pattern that imports \ndecrease more than exports. In the next graph, we see the inflation rate tends to increase \nduring a recession. The combination of high inflation and low growth suggests that \nrecessions in developing Asia are mainly driven by supply shocks rather than demand \nshocks. As Claessens et al. (2008) report, OECD countries exhibit the opposite pattern, \nwith the inflation rate decreasing during a recession.\nThe last two graphs in Figure 3  show that recessions are likely to be associated with \nfinancial downturns. In particular, the growth rate of real credit falls substantially in period \n1 and remains low even 3 years after the peak. This implies that adjustments in real \ncredit are quite persistent. Stock prices seem to be forward-looking (at least on the way \ndown), starting to fall even before the real economy peaks. Also, stock prices recover \nmore quickly than domestic credit.\nF.   Comparing the Current Recession with Past Recessions\n\ufffdsing the patterns in Figure 3, we can make a rough conjecture on how the current \nrecession in Asia will evolve in the coming years. To compare the current recession with \npast recessions, the most recent changes and forecasts (where available) for Asian \neconomies are plotted under the name \u201ccurrent recession.\u201d The economies considered \nare Hong Kong, China; Korea; Malaysia; Papua New Guinea; Philippines; Singapore; \nand Thailand, for which the Economist Intelligence \ufffdnit (EI\ufffd) forecasts negative GDP \ngrowth in 2009 (as of February). For these economies, period 0 refers to 2008. According \nto Figure 3, recent developments in GDP and its components have been similar to the \naverage during past recessions. This implies that, at the onset of the current recession, ", "1\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 15\u0018\nAsian economies were not particularly different from the norm. It is not clear, however, \nwhether the peak-to-trough drop will also be typical. The EI\ufffd predicts that, while GDP \nand consumption will decrease by about the same percentages as before, the fall in \nfixed investment will be more modest and the fall in exports will be more severe. This \nprediction seems reasonable because fixed investment growth prior to the peak before \nthis recession was not particularly high anyway, reducing the need for large adjustments \nin subsequent periods, and because export demand for Asian products will be hurt by the \nglobal recession.\nThe current account/GDP ratio is higher than usual because many Asian economies \nhad current account surpluses in recent years. As a consequence of the sharper-than-\nusual decrease in exports, current accounts are expected to deteriorate rather than \nimprove during the current recession. For the inflation rate and the financial variables, \nEI\ufffd forecasts are not available. Recent developments in these variables suggest that \ninflation may further pick up while domestic credit growth further decreases during the \ncurrent recession. The sharper-than-usual adjustment in stock prices hints that the current \nrecession will be a severe one. Above all, the sharper-than-usual fall in exports bodes ill \nfor the many highly trade-dependent Asian economies.\nIV. The Global Crises and Asia\nA.   The Impact of US/Global Crises on Asia  \nAs the ongoing global financial crisis continues to take its toll on the global real economy, \ntwo related questions are foremost on the minds of Asia\u2019s policymakers, researchers, \nand commentators. First, how deep will the global recession bite and for how long will \nit last, particularly as it relates to the \ufffdS economy (which aside from being the world\u2019s \nlargest economy, is the country where the crisis originated). Second, how bad will \nAsian economies be affected? The early view that the \ufffdS would have seen the worst of \nthe downturn heading into the second half of 2009 now looks increasingly optimistic.5 \nInstead, the prevailing view is one of continued bearishness at least until the last quarter \nof the year.6 \nThus far, the current \ufffdS recession has behaved very much like previous episodes of \nrecession cum financial crisis, which undoubtedly is more severe than the case without \nbanking and housing crises (see Reinhart and Rogoff 2008 and 2009; Claessens, Kose, \nand Terrones 2008; and Lall, Cardarelli, and Elekdag 2008). There are reasons to believe \nthe current downturn will be even more protracted. The build-up in the \ufffdS housing price \n5  For the earlier prediction see, among others, the \ufffdS Federal Reserve Board (2008) and Reddy (2008). \n6  See the latest forecasting survey by the Wall Street Journal in Evans and Izzo (2009). ", "Crises in Asia: Historical Perspectives and Implications  | 17\nbubble was unparallelled (Reinhart and Rogoff 2008) and the resulting pull-back in \nresidential investment has been equally sharp (Claessens et al. 2008). The bursting of the \nhousing bubble has not only devastated traditional banking institutions, but more so the \nhighly leveraged shadow banking institutions, with repercussions reaching every corner of \nthe financial system. Amid these ongoing corrections, the stock market continues to slide \ndownward. In essence, the \ufffdS is experiencing a tri-factor of housing bust, stock market \nbust, and credit crunch simultaneously. With all major economies in crisis to differing \ndegrees\u2014and worse, all contracting at the same time\u2014it will be a mammoth task for the \n\ufffdS to simply export its way out of the slump. Based on Reinhart and Rogoff\u2019s (2009) \nhistorical comparison of crisis events, a typical peak-to-trough real GDP contraction is \nabout 9.3% and lasts just under 2 years. This implies that if December 2007 was the \nstart of recession, as indicated by the National Bureau of Economic Research, the \ufffdS \neconomy should  stop contracting by end-2009. If, on the other hand, the collapse of \nLehman Brothers in September 2008 is taken as the beginning of the current recession, \nthe case for an early recovery in 2009 looks very unlikely. They also find real housing \nprices tend to fall 36% on average from peak to trough, lasting 5\u20136 years. Given the \nhousing price peak of 2005, this implies current prices still have 8\u201310% to fall and will \nlast well into 2011. In terms of equity prices, given that most stock prices peaked around \nmid-2007, any sustained rebound would be unlikely before 2010.\nBy and large, past US recessions were accompanied by recessions in other parts of the \nworld, including emerging Asia (Table 6). Because emerging Asia\u2019s economies are more \nopen, \ufffdS recessions and Asian recessions seem to be more synchronized. During the \npast five \ufffdS recessions since the early 1970s, \ufffdS real GDP contracted, on average, \n3.8% per year. GDP in other industrial countries fell by 2.0%; emerging Asia, 1.3%; \nLatin America, 1.7%; and emerging Europe, 3.6%. There were notable variations across \nrecessions and regions. The 1972\u20131974 recession was unique because it was a common \nshock (oil price) that affected nearly all countries simultaneously. On the other hand, \nthe 1982 recession, engineered to break the back of \ufffdS inflation, was accompanied \nby continued positive growth in other industrial countries, while significantly higher \ufffdS \ninterest rates and concern over debt sustainability brought large output contractions to \nLatin America and emerging Asia,. The 1991 recession was more specific to the \ufffdS due \npartly to the aftermath of the savings and loan crisis, where other industrial economies \nexperienced only small declines in growth and many emerging economies continued to \ngrow. And the 2001 \ufffdS recession was special to emerging Asia as it affected them more \nwidely than previous episodes. \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF 2008) provides a comprehensive study that \nattempts to analyze the impact of \ufffdS spillovers on Asia both descriptively and \nquantitatively. The study finds Asia\u2019s trade and financial links with the \ufffdS remain strong, \nand more importantly, that financial links have become stronger over time. Asia\u2019s export \nexposure to the \ufffdS has in fact risen, despite prima facie evidence of decoupling, if one \naccounts for the PRC\u2019s role as final assembler of goods eventually shipped to industrial \ncountries. Financial integration with the \ufffdS has also increased markedly\u2014given the huge ", "1\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 15\u0018\nrise in Asia\u2019s holdings of \ufffdS securities bought from the large accumulation of international \nreserves since the Asian financial crisis. In addition, Asia\u2019s growth\u2014particularly in the \nhigh-trade exposure economies of Malaysia; Singapore; and Taipei,China\u2014were more \ncorrelated with the \ufffdS growth cycle since 2000 than in the 1990s (see Kim, Lee, and \nPark 2009). The same can be said about financial correlations in the form of stock market \nmovements. As IMF (2007) noted, the correlations tended to be larger in falling markets. \nBesides trade openness and export exposure to the \ufffdS, other initial economic conditions \nbefore an economy enters recession matter as well. Emerging economies with high \ncurrent account deficits, net government debt, depreciated currencies, and larger negative \noutput gaps tend to be more affected by \ufffdS recessions than others.\nTable 6:  US Recessions and Global Growth\nRecession* Average\n1974\u201375 1980 1982 1991 2001\nChange in GDP growth (median for region)\nUS -6.\u0004 -3.4 -4.5 -2.\u0004 -2.9 -3.8\nOther Industrial Countries -5.4 -\u0004.5 0.4 -\u0004.3 -2.0 -2.0\nLatin America -3.2 -0.8 -3.9 \u0004.\u0004 -\u0004.8 -\u0004.7\nMiddle East and North Africa \u0004.2 -\u0004.0 -3.3 0.8 -0.7 -0.6\nEmerging Asia+ -3.5 -0.3 -\u0004.5 -0.\u0004 -\u0004.\u0004 -\u0004.3\nSub-Saharan Africa -0.5  \u2014 \u0004.0  \u2014 0.6 0.2\nEmerging Europe and CIS \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 -6.9 -0.3 -3.6\nRatio of Median Growth Changes to US Growth Changes (%)\nOther Industrial Countries 90 44 -\u00040 6\u0004 69 5\u0004\nLatin America 52 22 87 -53 6\u0004 34\nMiddle East and North Africa -20 30 74 -38 24 \u00044\nEmerging Asia 57 \u00040 33 4 37 28\nSub-Saharan Africa 9 -\u0004 -23 0 -\u00049 -7\nEmerging Europe and CIS \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 335 \u0004\u0004 \u000473\nPercent of Countries Experiencing Growth Declines\nOther Industrial Countries 9\u0004 64 45 73 9\u0004 73\nLatin America 77 62 90 37 83 70\nMiddle East and North Africa 40 57 60 40 53 50\nEmerging Asia 72 56 78 53 84 68\nSub-Saharan Africa 53 50 46 50 35 47\nEmerging Europe and CIS \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 93 60 76\n\u2026  means nonavailability of data.\nCIS = Commonwealth of Independent States.\n*  Year during which most of the impact on US growth was recorded\u2014may not be the same as the dating by the National Bureau \nof Economic Research. \n+  Emerging Asia refers to People\u2019s Republic of China; India; Hong Kong, China; Republic of Korea; Singapore; Taipei,China; \nIndonesia; Malaysia; Philippines; Thailand; and Viet Nam.\nSource:  Based on Table 4.4 in World Economic Outlook (IMF 2007).\nIn terms of the quantitative impact of \ufffdS recessions, Table 7  summarizes the results of \ndifferent methodologies used in the study, which range from a decline of 0.2% to 0.6% \nin Asia for every percentage point fall in \ufffdS real GDP. Within Asia, different economies \nare affected differently with the more open ones being more vulnerable. For example, \nresults from the vector autoregression model show the impact ranges from a decline of \n0.0% to 0.9%. Among them, the high-trade exposure economies are most susceptible: ", "Crises in Asia: Historical Perspectives and Implications  | 19\nSingapore declined by 0.9; Taipei,China 0.9; Hong Kong, China 0.8; and Malaysia 0.7.7 \nInterestingly, though the results are not shown here, during 1996\u20132007, the impact of the \n\ufffdS recession on Asian economies was larger than during the previous 1980\u20131995 period, \nreinforcing the importance of increased indirect trade exposure and financial linkages to \nthe \ufffdS. Finally, the study also examines several past \ufffdS recessions (1980, 1981\u20131982, \n1990\u20131991, and 2001) and finds that the 2001 recession was most severe. The burst of \nthe information technology bubble in 2001 badly impeded electronics, a key export driver \nof Asian economies. As expected, economies that were most dependent on electronics \nwere most severely affected: Malaysia; Singapore; and Taipei,China. Moreover, the 2001 \nUS recession occured when many economies were still recuperating and undergoing \nreforms in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis. \nTable 7: Summary Results: Impact of a One Percentage Point US Slowdown\n(in percentage points)\nVector Autoregression Cross-Country  2001 Recession1\nRegressions\nJapan  0.2 0.3 0.7\nAustralia 0.5 0.7 0.4\nNew Zealand 0.3 0.9 0.0\nChina, People\u2019s Republic Rep. of  0.0 0.\u0004 0.2\nHong Kong, China 0.8 \u0004.0 \u0004.5\nIndia 0.0 -0.2 -0.\u0004\nIndonesia 0.4 0.2 -0.3\nKorea, Rep. of 0.\u0004 0.\u0004 0.5\nMalaysia 0.7 0.5 \u0004.8\nPhilippines 0.4 0.6 0.6\nSingapore 0.9 \u0004.\u0004 4.\u0004\nTaipei,China 0.9 \u0004.2 2.9\nThailand 0.5 \u0004.0 0.5\nAsia*  0.2 0.3 0.6\nEmerging Asia* 0.2 0.2 0.5\nEmerging Asia*   0.5 0.5 \u0004.\u0004\n  (ex.

The biggest declines, \nhowever, were recorded during World War II, in the vicinity of 50% for most Asian \neconomies, and lasted between 5 to 9 years, though not strictly triggered by the \ufffdS \nrecession.\nB.   Synchronization of Global Crises and Asian Recessions\nIn this subsection, we calculate various conditional probabilities to see how \ufffdS financial \ncrises (and global recessions) relate to Asian financial crises and recessions. The \nmethodology is the same as in Table 5. We count the frequencies of foreign crises, Asian \ncrises, and their joint events, and compute the probability of an Asian crisis conditional on \na \ufffdS crisis. Table 9, Panel A, last column, shows there is a 40% chance that Asia also \nexperiences a credit contraction for a given \ufffdS credit contraction. However, there is only \nan 8% chance that the Asian credit contraction will be a severe one. In the case of stock \nprice declines (Panel B), there is a larger 51% chance that Asia also experiences a stock \nprice decline when the \ufffdS stock price drops. Similarly, the chances of that coinciding \nwith a severe Asian stock price decline are also higher at 12% when compared with a \ncredit contraction. This highlights the greater regularity of stock price declines (or volatility \nof stock price movements) in contrast to credit contractions. What is also salient is that \nin the severe cases of US credit contractions and severe US stock price declines, the \nprobabilities of Asian credit contractions and stock price declines are even greater, at \n63% and 88% respectively. This means that when a severe credit contraction (or severe \nstock price decline) happens in the US, the chances of an Asian credit contraction (or \nstock price decline) also increases. \nTable 9: Frequencies of US Credit Contractions/Stock Price Declines and Asian Credit \nContractions/Stock Price Declines\nA: US Credit  Asian Credit  Frequency of Conditional \nContractions Contractions US Credit  Asian Credit  Joint Event Probability\nContractions Contractions\nAll All 75 \u0004\u00049 30 0.40\nAll Severe 75 28 6 0.08\nSevere All 35 \u0004\u00049 22 0.63\nSevere Severe 35 28 4 0.\u0004\u0004\nFrequency of\nB: US Stock  Asian Stock  US Stock Price  Asian Stock  Joint Event Conditional \nPrice Declines Price Declines Declines Price Declines Probability\nAll All 94 98 48 0.5\u0004\nAll Severe 94 22 \u0004\u0004 0.\u00042\nSevere All 42 98 37 0.88\nSevere Severe 42 22 9 0.2\u0004\nNote:   Severe US credit contractions refer to US credit contractions with the amplitude greater than the median.

", "\u0018\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 15\u0018\nAnother interesting aspect to examine is the relationships between \ufffdS credit contractions \nand stock price declines with Asian recessions. These results are presented in Table 10. \nWhat stands out is that for a given US credit contraction or US stock price decline, \nthe chances of Asia being in recession are much less than Asia in credit contraction \nor having a stock price decline. Simply put, this means not all \ufffdS financial downturns \nlead to an Asian recession. Still, if it is a \ufffdS credit contraction, the chances of an \nAsian recession are higher (at 19%) than if it is a \ufffdS stock price decline (13%). \nAlthough stock price declines happen more often than credit contractions, their impact \non Asian economic activity is not as detrimental. Likewise as in Table 9, the severity \nof \ufffdS financial downturns increases the chances of Asian recession. An even more \ninteresting relationship to examine is between OECD (including \ufffdS) recessions and Asian \nrecessions. Table 11 shows a 14% chance of an Asian recession happens together with \nan OECD recession. In case of a severe OECD/\ufffdS recession, the chances of an Asian \nrecession increases further to 24%.8 \nTable 10: Frequencies of US Credit Contractions/Stock Price Declines and Asian Recessions\nA: US Credit  Asian  Frequency of Conditional \nContractions Recessions US Credit  Asian  Joint Event Probability\nContractions Recessions\nAll All 85 5\u0004 \u00046 0.\u00049\nAll Severe 85 \u00043 3 0.04\nSevere All 44 5\u0004 \u00044 0.32\nSevere Severe 44 \u00043 3 0.07\nB: US Stock  Asian  Frequency of Conditional \nPrice Declines Recessions US Stock Price  Asian  Joint Event Probability\nDeclines Recessions\nAll All 2\u00042 5\u0004 28 0.\u00043\nAll Severe 2\u00042 \u00043 8 0.04\nSevere All \u0004\u00043 5\u0004 \u00045 0.\u00043\nSevere Severe \u0004\u00043 \u00043 3 0.03\nNote:   Severe US credit contractions refer to US credit contractions with the amplitude greater than the median.

Concluding Remarks \nOur analysis of historical crisis episodes in Asia shows that while there is substantial \ndiversity, on average recessions and financial downturns are more frequent, longer \nlasting, and more severe in Asian economies than in OECD countries. We also find that \nthe likelihood and severity of a recession tends to increase when it is associated with \nfinancial crises, such as credit crunches and stock market crashes. The probability of an \nAsian recession is 19% conditional on stock price decline, and jumps to 52% conditional \non a stock market crash.\nOur results also support the strong links between Asian economies and the global \neconomy. Severe financial downturns or recessions in advanced economies are often \nassociated with financial crises or recessions in Asia. Conditional on a stock market crash \nin the \ufffdS, the probability of an Asian credit contraction is 63% and stock price decline is \n88%. The probability of an Asian recession is 14% conditional on an OECD/\ufffdS recession, \nand 24% on a severe OECD/\ufffdS recession. \nThe financial turmoil that stemmed from the \ufffdS subprime mortgage crisis in 2007 has \nblown up into a global economic crisis. Major industrialized economies have already \nentered recessions and despite policy measures taken, the probability of a deeper and \nmore prolonged global recession is high. Emerging Asian economies have also been \nhit hard due to strong links between Asian economies and the global economy through \ntrade and financial channels. A rapid reversal in capital flows due to risk repricing and \ndeleveraging has led to a squeeze of external funding conditions and a collapse of asset \nprices. Asian export growth is slowing sharply as demand from major economies shrinks.     \nGiven the severity of the current global crisis and financial downturns, the risk that \nmany Asian economies will experience a deeper recession is high. The stylized facts of \nthe movements of macroeconomic and financial variables from the historical recession \nepisodes suggest that sharper declines in stock prices and export demand are associated \nwith severe recession. However, considering that the current recession is unprecedented \nin many aspects, this episode may not entirely follow the stylized pattern previous \nrecessions have taken.  \nIn addition, the actual impact of the global crisis on Asian economies depends on the \npolicies adopted in response to the crisis. Policymakers across the region have taken \nimmediate actions to contain the spillover effects of global financial turmoil on domestic \nfinancial systems. However, the wide spread of the crisis on to the real sector has called \nfor policy reactions to hold down economic deterioration. Asian countries have adopted \na mix of policy tools including monetary, financial, fiscal, exchange rate, and structural. \nBut it remains a question of what types of policies would be more effective in reducing \nthe length and severity of the recession. For example, the current public debate focuses \non calling for more active fiscal responses, considering that monetary policy may have ", "\u0018\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 15\u0018\nless traction when financial conditions worsen. However, it is not clear whether and to \nwhat extent countercyclical fiscal policies can help limit the impact of the global crisis. \nThis is where future research on the role of national policies in dealing with financial and \nmacroeconomic crises in Asia will be useful.  \nReferences\nAgenor, P., C.

", "About the Paper\nKiseok Hong, Jong-Wha Lee, and Hsiao Chink Tang find that based on historical crisis \nepisodes in 21 developing Asian economies from 1961 to 2007, recessions and financial \ndownturns are more frequent, longer lasting, and more severe  in Asia than in the \nindustralized countries. Also, severe financial downturns or recessions in the global \neconomy are often coupled with financial crises or recessions in Asia. The severity of the \ncurrent global financial crisis and recession means Asian economies are likely to experience \na severe recession in 2009.\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their \npeople. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two thirds of the world\u2019s \npoor: 1.8 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less \nthan $1.25 a day.  ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic \ngrowth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. \n     Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/economics\nISSN: 1655-5252\nPublication Stock No.: \nPrinted in the Philippines"], "metadata": {"Author": "Kiseok Hong, Jong-Wha Lee, Hsiao Chink Tang", "CreationDate": "D:20090326110241+08'00'", "Creator": "Adobe InDesign CS2 (4.0.5)", "Keywords": "capital, markets, financial crisis, credit crunch, gross domestic product, gdp, consumer price index, cpi, organization for economic co-operation and development, OECD, bangladesh, ban, people's republic of china, prc, hong kong, china, hkg, india, ind", "ModDate": "D:20130813185455+08'00'", "Producer": "Adobe PDF Library 7.0", "Subject": "The paper analyzes the stylized features of historical crisis episodes for 21 developing Asian economies over 1961-2007.", "Title": "Crises in Asia: Historical Perspectives and Implications", "Trapped": "False"}}
