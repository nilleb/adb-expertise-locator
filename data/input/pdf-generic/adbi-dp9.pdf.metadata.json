Such schemes can range from the \nprovision of infrastructure, subsidized food, employment creation, access to health and \nother social facilities, microfinance and occasionally cash grants. Types of targeting \ninclude that by activity, such as primary health care and primary education, where it is \nestablished that the distribution of benefits tends to be progressive (so-called \u2018broad \ntargeting\u2019), by indicator, where alternatives to income that may be expected to be \ncorrelated with poverty are used to identify the poor, by location, where area of \nresidence becomes the criteria for identifying the target group, and self-targeting, where \nprograms are designed to be attractive only to the poor.  Insofar as these measures all \ninvolve the use of public resources to achieve benefits for a target group at or below the \npoverty line they can be thought of a \u2018poverty projects,\u2019 whose efficiency in principle \nshould be amenable to formal quantification. \n \nPoverty targeted interventions achieved prominence in development initiatives in the \n1990\u2019s in part due to the demonstrated weakness of universal schemes with high \nleakage rates and in part due to fiscal pressures that undermined governments\u2019 ability to \nfunds large universal programs (World Bank 1990).1 This paper surveys briefly evidence \non the impact of poverty projects in a number of large economies in South Asia (India), \nSouth East Asia (Thailand, Philippines and Indonesia) as well as in People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC), drawing on the detailed studies in Weiss (2005). In some of these \ncountries poverty targeting has a relatively long history stemming from longstanding \nsocial welfare concerns (India and to some extent the Philippines and PRC), whilst \nelsewhere it originated principally in the late 1990\u2019s in response to the impact of the \nregional Financial Crisis (Thailand and Indonesia). The paper begins with a digression \non methodology, before giving an overview of the quantitative importance of such \nprojects. It then highlights difficulties in relation to identification of the poor, and errors of \ntargeting relating to both misappropriation and technical errors causing under-coverage \nand leakage. Finally we draw some conclusions.   \n \n \nAppraisal methodology for poverty projects \n \nA basic distinction in the targeting literature is between two forms of error, that of under-\ncoverage, that is the failure to reach some of the target group, and of leakage, that is \nwhere benefits accrue to those outside the target group. Following statistical terminology \nthese are termed \u2018type 1\u2019 and \u2018type 2\u2019 errors, respectively. Practical application of \ntargeting measures inevitably involves some trade-off between these two errors. For \nexample to minimize undercoverage or type 1 error more generous means of assessing \n\n                                                 \n1 Besley and Kanpur (1991) introduce the theory of targeting in a development context. Finely \ntargeted schemes imply high administrative costs for their operation and in general there will be \nan expectation that the more finely targeted these are (that is the lower is the degree of leakage) \nthe higher will be the ratio of administrative costs to benefits to the poor. This has the important \nimplication that the optimal degree of targeting need not be to be aim for the minimum degree of \nleakage, since the costs of such targeting need to be compared with the benefits. \n\n \n\n2\n\n\feligibility may be used, whilst to minimize leakage or type 2 error, stricter criteria may be \napplied, and if these are not specified or applied correctly they may serve to exclude \nsome of the target group (Cornia and Stewart 1993). \n \nIf the objective of a project is to channel resources to the poor and it suffers from type 1 \nand  type 2 errors, as noted above, such projects may have low social returns? However \nquantifying project impact has rarely been done with any rigor and there are important \nconceptual issues to be addressed. For example, if one wishes to estimate a social \nreturn to such a project strictly one must identify the full distribution of the benefits from \nthe project. As the poor are the target group they are explicitly favored, with the \nimplication that benefits they receive have a higher social value than benefits received or \ncosts incurred by those who are above the poverty line. Hence full social appraisal \nrequires not only that all project effects (both short term and long- term) be monetized, \nbut that benefits be adjusted by a set of social weights that reflect an aversion to \ninequality or poverty (or both). These weighted benefits must then be compared with the \nfull costs of the targeting project, both administrative and running costs of the project and \ncosts of additional government financing (for example through taxation or bond issue) if \nit is a project that is incremental to the budget. Hence social efficiency E can be \nexpressed as  \n \n\nE =        \u03a3i(di* Bi)  + \u03a3j(dj*Bj)   -  \u03a3jdj*A( 1 + t)                                              (1) \n \nWhere Bi and Bj are the present value of benefits to groups i (the poor) and j (the \nnon-poor), respectively, di and dj are the social weights for gains to these groups, A is \nthe present value of the administrative and running costs of a project and t is the cost of \nadditional financing as a proportion of the funds required. An efficient project requires \nE>0.  \n \nThe greater is leakage the larger will be Bj relative to Bi, and the greater is under-\ncoverage the lower will be Bi relative to its potential. A time profile of impacts is required \nand this will vary greatly between targeting interventions; food subsidies or employment \nschemes, for example, will provide immediate consumption, whilst microfinance and \nhealth cards will longer-term impacts. Long-run impacts are not always more desirable, if \na short-term transfer can forestall catastrophic consequences, like starvation, although \nthis raises complex problem of valuation, where life saving effects are involved and an \nappropriate discount rate will be needed.2  \n\n \nThe groups the poor and non-poor can be treated as homogenous or broken down by \nliving standard. In the first case there will be simply two weights di and dj, but in the latter \ncase there will be a range for all i and all j. The theoretical literature has offered as the \nmain solution to the weighting problem, a continuous weighting function based on \ndiminishing marginal utility of consumption at a constant elasticity.  This requires a \nreference point (for example, the poverty line consumption level) as the numeraire and \nan elasticity parameter reflecting the degree of aversion to inequality. \n\n                                                 \n2 The theory underlying this exposition is in Squire and van der Tak (1975), with a restatement in \nBrent (1990) and Curry and Weiss (2000). Complications related to the costs of raising public \nfunding to cover A and who bears this cost, can be removed if one assumes that there is a fixed \ngovernment budget irrespective of choice project so that the costs of raising A are the same, \nwhichever project is implemented. \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n\n\fThus for group x the social weight dx is   \n \ndx =  (cp/cx)n                                                    (2)      \n                                                                         \nwhere cp is the poverty line consumption, cx is per capita consumption for group or \n\nhousehold x and n is the elasticity parameter. \n\n \nA weighting scheme such as this is implicit in the widely cited \u2018squared poverty gap\u2019 \n\nmeasure of poverty that utilizes a value of n equals 2.0 (Foster et al 1984). Use of a \nvalue of two for the elasticity parameter has the implication that gains to the poorest of \nthe poor, receive a very high weight. For example whilst those on the poverty line have a \nweight of 1.0, those at 50 per cent of the poverty line consumption have a weight of 4.0. \nConversely those above it have a very low weight. A household with an average \nconsumption of twice the poverty line has a weight of only 0.25 for example. \n\n \nIn practice, however, calculations based on (1) are rarely, if ever, carried out for \npoverty projects, due to a combination of lack of data and lack of consensus on the \nprecise weights to use. Less ambitious and much closer to practice is the alternative of \nsetting out the targeting problem as one of cost-effectiveness, with the objective to \nprovide an income transfer or its equivalent, to the poor at the lowest cost. Now using \nthe previous terminology social efficiency requires that one minimizes the A/Bi ratio, \nwhere both sides of the ratio are present values and there is no distinction drawn \nbetween groups of the poor (di = 1.0). One can of course attempt to disaggregate gains \nto the poor and employ a weighting function as in (2), although this is rarely if ever done.  \n\n \nStrictly ranking poverty projects by A/Bi will be valid where there is no concern for \ntransfers to the non-poor (dj = 0) and where one is comparing alternative schemes with \nthe same scale of impact. If this latter qualification is not made one can choose low cost \nschemes with a small impact, over larger schemes with a higher cost, and this may imply \nimplicit valuations of gains to the poor that if made explicit would be unacceptable. Also \nwhere one ranks projects by a cost-effectiveness indicator, one still requires some cut-\noff point at which a targeting project becomes too high cost as a means of reaching the \npoor. In principle assuming social budgets for targeting are fixed, this would be the cost-\neffectiveness of the marginal scheme that just exhausts the available budget. If budgets \nare not fixed the cut-off rate could be set as the cost of raising additional government \nfunds (for example the deadweight and incentive losses from raising taxes) plus the \nadministrative cost of a cash transfer to the poor, per unit of benefit received.  Allowing \nfor longer-term productive impacts, any poverty project that could not match this cost on \na long-term basis should not be implemented since cash transfers would be lower cost. \nIn practice neither of these figures for the cut-off rate are known with any degree of \nprecision and comparisons are likely to be based on approximate rules of thumb, for \nexample costs on similar types of project either in the country or elsewhere. \n \n \n  How important have poverty-targeting measures been in monetary terms? \n \n     This question is important not just in assessing the overall impact of such \nexpenditures on the poor, but also in terms of the potential trade-off between poverty \nalleviation and economic growth. It is well known that in the longer term it is sustained \ngrowth that drives poverty reduction. There is a vast literature on the relationship \nbetween growth and poverty, which concludes there is virtually everywhere a clear \n\n \n\n4\n\n\fnegative relationship, although its strength varies between countries, with different \nsocial, economic and political structures. 3  In most countries, however, the scale of \npublic poverty projects has not been large enough to raise the issue of a potential or \nactual trade-off. Further there is often lack of clarity as to what actually constitutes \npoverty targeted expenditures. \n \nIndia is the country with the longest record of poverty \u2013focused interventions and of our \ncases the one where such expenditures appear to have taken the highest share of the \nbudget of central and state or local governments. Estimation of total expenditure on \npoverty-targeted programs in India is difficult because of the variety of schemes and the \nrange of financing whether at the central, state or district level. Excluding fertilizer \nsubsidies, which are not explicitly targeted at poor farmers, Srivastava (2005) estimates \nexpenditure on the largest targeted programs to be about Rs 411 bill in 2001-02 (which \nis about 11 % of the central government expenditure and 2% of GDP). 4 If fertilizer \nsubsidies are treated as poverty targeted interventions the proportions rise to 15% and \n3%, respectively. Another estimate of the time trend of this expenditure suggests a rise \nof about 50% in real terms over the 1990\u2019s with the main increase between 1992-3 and \n1993-4 (Shariff et al 2002).  \n \nIn PRC since the mid 1980\u2019s, when the responsibility for poverty reduction initiatives was \ncentralized in the Leading Group for Poverty Reduction of the State Council, three types \nof funds are categorized in official statistics as central government poverty reduction \nfunds \u2013 subsidized loans, workfare programs and budgetary funds for poor counties. In \n2002 these were RMB 29.1 bill showing a real average annual growth since 1986 of \naround 6%. Most of this real increase came after 1996 and the real value of these funds \nalmost trebled between 1996 and 2002 (Wang 2005, table 4.15). There are also poverty \nexpenditures by local governments and government departments that might be as much \nas 25% of the central government poverty expenditure (or around another RMB 7.5 bill). \nIn combination this estimate of RMB 37 bill is 5 % of the central government budget in \n2002. Over the period 1986-2002 central government poverty expenditure has averaged \n5% of the budget and no more than 0.2% of GDP (Wang 2005, table 4.15). \n \nIn Indonesia although it is difficult to obtain data on the costs of all schemes, in 1998-99 \nat their peak, approximate estimates suggest that they might have taken around 9% of \nthe central government budget  (Perdana and Maxwell 2005, table 3.6). In Thailand \ngovernment poverty reduction programs have focused on cash and in-kind (principally \n\n                                                 \n3 Warr (2000), for example, examines changes in poverty incidence (the headcount ratio based \non official poverty estimates) across a set of countries including India, Indonesia and Thailand. \nHe finds elasticities of poverty incidence (the proportionate change in the headcount ratio relative \nto the proportionate change in GDP per capita) of \u20130.9 for India, -2.0 for Thailand, and \u20130.7 for \nthe Philippines. For PRC a similar exercise finds an elasticity for poverty incidence of -0.8 (World \nBank 2001). Estimates are also available for the income poverty elasticity, that is the relation \nbetween growth (change in mean income) and the change in the income of the poor (normally \ntaken as the bottom quintile). For the Philippines the income poverty elasticity (defined as the \nratio of latter to the former) is found to be relatively low at 0.54, whilst for Indonesia the \ncomparable elasticity is 0.71 (Balisacan and Pernia 2003, Balisacan, Pernia and Asra 2003). In \nboth countries there is a clear tendency for the elasticity for different quintiles to rise as one \nmoves up the income scale, although this is particularly marked in the Philippines. In other words, \nalthough the poor benefit from growth they do not benefit as much (both proportionately as well \nas absolutely) as the better \u2013off.  \n4 Schemes with budgets of below Rs 1 bill are excluded from this total. \n\n \n\n5\n\n\fhealth facility) transfers to poor families, and interest free loans for either productive \nactivities or education. Over the 1990\u2019s these programs in total rose from 1.1% (in 1993) \nto 4.6% (in 2000) of central government expenditure (Warr and Sarnsitart 2005, table \n5.13). However the education loans program is controversial and there is some dispute \nas to whether it is poverty-focused. If it is excluded the increase in poverty-related \nexpenditure is from 1.1% to 3.3% of total central government expenditure. Since 2000 \nthe government definition of poverty-focused expenditure has been widened \nconsiderably with the result that now officially a significantly higher proportion of \nexpenditures are seen as poverty programs. Under this wider definition these activities \ntook 10% of central government expenditure in 2000 rising to around 13% in 2003 (Warr \nand Sarntisart 2005, table 5.16).  \n \nIn the Philippines even including the food subsidy activities of the National Food \nAuthority (NFA), which were often general rather than targeted, total direct poverty \nfocused expenditure was not more than 1.5% of total central government expenditure in \nthe immediate pre-Crisis period in 1997-98 and no more than 0.3% of GDP (Balisacan \nand Edillon, 2005). \n \nThese poverty projects have encountered a range of problems and we highlight these \nbelow prior to a discussion of their overall effectiveness.  \n \n \nIdentification of the poor. \n \nApart from self-targeting and the use of broad targeting, that focuses on particular \ncategories of activities rather than their users, other forms of targeting, by definition, \nrequire inclusion and exclusion criteria, so that the poor can be separated from the non-\npoor. However collecting accurate data on income or consumption is difficult. The use of \nmodern \u2018poverty mapping\u2019 techniques, which combine data from household surveys (that \nallow a link between consumption levels and various household characteristics) with \ndata from population censuses that collect detailed location-based data on households, \nis very recent for our country cases.5 Hence in practice up to very recently all of the \ncountries used approximate indicators for identifying the poor; for example various basic \nneed measures or rough estimates of average income in a particular village or larger \nunit. \n \nIn India there was a serious effort in the 1990\u2019s at administrative identification of the poor \nas a means of targeting principally the food and other subsidies from the public \ndistribution system. As income estimates were uncertain, other additional criteria \nincluded housing conditions, number of family earners, land access and ownership of \nlivestock and consumer durables. State governments had the responsibility for \nidentifying the poor, although the process was slow and incomplete and even where \n\n                                                 \n5 For example, a poverty map has just been completed on a trial basis for three provinces in \nIndonesia  (Suryahadi et al 2003). There are doubts however as to whether this approach can \napply at the village level. Hentschel et al (2000) explain the poverty mapping approach and \nillustrate how it can improve on the use of simple basic indicators to identify the poor. \n\n \n\n6\n\n\fsurveys were undertaken identification cards were not provided to a significant number \nof poor families.6  \n \nIn Indonesia receipt of food subsidies was determined by the classification scheme of \nthe National Family Planning Coordinating Board (BKKBN), which covers households \nnationally. This classified households into a number of categories on the basis of criteria \nincluding food consumption patterns, access to health care and possession of alternative \nsets of clothing. In response to the impact of the Crisis of 1998-99 additional economic \ncriteria were added; the poorest category covered households that failed any one of the \nfollowing;  \n\n-  all family members normally able to eat at least twice a day; \n-  all family members have different types of clothing for home, work, school and so \n\n- \n- \n\nforth; \nthe largest section of the floor of the family home is not made of earth; \nsick children are able to receive modern medical attention and women have \naccess to family planning services. \n\nHowever administration of the food subsidy program showed both a disappointingly high \nleakage rate to the non-poor and high undercoverage.7 \n \n  Village-based programs were also an important part of targeted poverty measures in \nIndonesia. Here poor villages were designated using a scoring system covering social \nand economic characteristics, including infrastructure, housing and population. \nClassification of a village as poor (\u2018neglected\u2019) was based on a combination of its \nposition relative to the provincial average and a subjective assessment from a field \ninspection by local officials. By this twin approach, 31% of villages in the country were \nclassed as neglected in 1993. Within these villages village leaders appear to have had a \nmajor influence on how program funds were allocated (Perdana and Maxwell 2005).  \n \nIn PRC, the Philippines and Thailand  geographic targeting was the key approach, with \nas we shall see problems in ensuring that this was implemented accurately.  \n \nErrors of targeting - misappropriation \n \nApart from technical difficulties in identifying, who the poor actually are, in all the country \ncases weak governance helps explain relatively high levels of leakage, as funds \nintended for the poor are diverted to others. This is brought out in a number of evaluation \nreports on the various targeting schemes. Food and credit subsidy programs and \nemployment creation schemes, in particular, offer considerable scope for malpractice. \nIndia may not be the worst of the country cases studied here, but various evaluation \nreports both official and unofficial ensure that error there are the best documented.  \n \nApart from the early days of the Maharashtra Employment Guarantee Scheme, \nemployment creation and food for work programs are judged to have fared poorly.8 An \n\n                                                 \n6 For evidence of undercoverage a World Bank survey in Uttar Pradesh, one of the poorest \nstates, found that 56% of the lowest income quintile did not get identification cards to enable them \nto access the public distribution system (Srivastava 2005). \n7 Perdana and Maxwell (2005) report that in the late 1990\u2019s those in the top four quintiles of \nhousehold expenditure were three quarters of the recipients of subsidized rice and that only \nroughly half poor families under the official criteria were recipients. \n\n \n\n7\n\n\fassessment of the Employment Assurance Scheme (EAS) found that the rules were \nbeing broken (for example self-selection was undermined by the use of contractors who \nhired local labor and the norm that 60% of costs should be on labor was often ignored). \nNationally it was estimated that only 15% of expenditure on the scheme was going as \nbenefits to workers, against a target of 60%. Another well-studied scheme has been the \nComprehensive Rural Employment Scheme formed by a merger of the EAS with another \nscheme. Here poor workers are to receive foodgrains as payment in kind for wages, as \nwell as some money income. There is an estimate that due to malpractice amongst local \ngovernment administrators and contractors no more than 25% of the wage fund that the \npoor are entitled to actually reaches them (Nayak et al 2002). Another study drawing on \na village level survey in Andhra Pradesh finds local elites controlling the implementation \nof the scheme at the village level, with beneficiaries (that is those who would obtain work \nand food) selected at local meetings. Contrary to the guidelines of the scheme the use of \ncontractors was widespread. The contractors were often found to obtain profits illegally \nthrough a number of means including claiming the full rice quota for incomplete work, \ndouble-claiming to different government departments, submitting inflated costs and \npaying workers wholly in cash and reselling the rice on the open market (Deshingkar and \nJohnson 2003).  \nApart from motives of corruption, the institutional objectives of public officials can also \ncreate targeting errors. This appears to have been particularly important in the poor \ncounty employment creation and subsidized loan programs in PRC, where because of \nthe financial constraints they faced, local officials had incentives to divert funds to \nprojects capable of generating revenue rather than funding projects with the greatest \ndirect poverty impact (Wang 2005). Similarly with micro credit schemes, the officials of \nthe implementing banks were under pressure to lend to the more credit-worthy \ncustomers who would not be the poorest households (Park and Ren 2001). \n \n \nErrors of undercoverage and leakage \n \nAside from malpractice, which has been relatively common, if not always well \ndocumented, there are many instances of technical errors of targeting. This can be \ndemonstrated most readily for location targeting measures, since average income and \nconsumption estimates are normally available at the level of provincial or local \ngovernment units and these can be compared with national or provincial poverty lines \nand with the allocation of public expenditure. Most studies indicate that regional targeting \nhas in practice been a relatively \u2018blunt instrument\u2019 for reaching the poor.  \n \nFor Thailand, we have detailed evidence from Warr and Sarntisart (2005), who examine \nthe distribution of government expenditure between rich and poor provinces, although \nthey have no information to allow an assessment of intra-province distribution. They \ncorrelate provincial public expenditure per capita under different broad categories with \nprovincial per capita incomes and find positive elasticities, so that in general expenditure \nper person and by implication benefit rises with income. Hence there is no evidence of \nprogressive targeting across provinces by broad expenditure category. When the same \nexercise is repeated for the specifically poverty-focused expenditure no significant \nrelationship with provincial income per capita is found for most categories. However \n\n                                                                                                                                                 \n8 This scheme received a great of attention internationally and was commented on very favorably \nin World Bank (1990). Its performance declined substantially after 1979 following a large increase \nin the wage offered, thus weakening the self-selection by the poor (Gaiha 1996).  \n\n \n\n8\n\n\fprovincial size does appear to matter so that, in general on a per capita basis, smaller \nprovinces are favored in poverty-targeted expenditure. Only in the case of one minor \ncategory (the \u2018Poor and Low Income People\u2019 expenditure) is there a significant negative \nrelationship between allocations per capita and provincial income. This category was \nonly 6% of total poverty expenditures over 2000-2002, and within it the clearest evidence \nof a progressive allocation was for grants for health care. Hence on a regional basis \nwithin Thailand, there is no evidence of a successful targeting at poorer provinces.  \n \nFor PRC, Park et al (2002) and Wang (2005) assess what they term targeting gap errors \nby examining the classification of counties as \u2018poor\u2019 in the light of their estimated income \nper capita relative to the poverty line.9 What they term the targeting count gap (TCG) can \nbe interpreted as the percentage of counties that are mistargeted and this can be \ndisaggregated into the two types of error. Table 1 below shows the situation taking the \nofficial poverty line to estimate mistargeting. \n \n \nTable 1 PRC Provinces: Targeting Count Gap 1986 to 1995 \n\nYear  \n\nType 1 error \n\nType 2 error \n\nTotal \n\n(undercoverage) \n\n(leakage) \n\n0.094 \n\n0.082 \n\n0.044 \n\n0.056 \n\n0.078 \n\n0.058 \n\n0.038 \n\n0.002 \n\n0.005 \n\n0.004 \n\n0.144 \n\n0.146 \n\n0.144 \n\n0.152 \n\n0.171 \n\n0.158 \n\n0.145 \n\n0.227 \n\n0.237 \n\n0.222 \n\nSource: Park et al (2002) table 4. \n\n                                                 \n9 The targeting count gap (TCG) is defined as  \n\nTCGt  = 1/N \u2211 {Iit1(Pit =0, Yit<Zt)  + Iit2 (Pit = 1, Yit>Zt)} \n\nWhere N is the total number of counties, indexed by i and t is a time period.

However even with perfect designation at the \ncounty level there would still be targeting errors due to the present of the non-poor in \npoor counties and of the poor in non-poor counties. Estimates suggest that the share of \nthe poor (at the official poverty line) living in non-poor counties rose from 29% in 1992 to \n38% in 2001 (Wang 2005).10 \n \nFurther evidence of errors in regional targeting comes from the Philippines. Balisacan et \nal (2000) identify the 25 most depressed provinces in the late 1990\u2019s ranked alternatively \nby the incidence of poverty or by the poverty gap measure (the rankings are not \nidentical). These are then compared with the priority provinces under the Social Reform \nAgenda of the Ramos administration. Out of the 26 priority provinces only 11 are in the \nranking of most depressed by the poverty indicators. It is clear that formal poverty data \nwere only one of a number of factors used by the government to determine priority \nstatus. \n \n For Indonesia, the National Economic Survey (SUSENAS) provides detailed \ninformation, which has been used to assess who has benefited from the set of poverty \ntargeting measures introduced in the wake of the Financial Crisis (Perdana and Maxwell \nin this volume). Table 2 summarizes the results of the most detailed study based on this \ndata. \n \nTable 2 Indonesia: Impact of anti-poverty programs Aug 1998- Feb 1999 \n\nProgram \n\nPotential \n\nCoverage\n\nCoverage \n\nCoverage \n\nProportion \n\nrecipients \n\nPoorest \n\nRichest \n\nall \n\nof \n\n(mill) \n\n20% (%) \n\n20% (%) \n\npotential \n\nbeneficiaries \n\nTargeting \nratioa \n (%) \n\n50.4 \n\n52.6 \n\n24.3 \n\n0.92 \n\nrecipients \n\nfrom non-\n\n(%) \n\n40.1 \n\npoor  \n\n0.74 \n\nSubsidized \nriceb \n\nEmployment \ncreationb \n\nPrimary \nscholarshipsc \n\nsecondary \n\n50.4 \n\n8.3 \n\n2.5 \n\n5.6 \n\n0.70 \n\n0.88 \n\n29.7 \n\n5.8 \n\n2.0 \n\n4.0 \n\n0.71 \n\n0.89 \n\nLower \n\n10.4 \n\n12.2 \n\n4.9 \n\n8.4 \n\n0.71 \n\n0.89 \n\n                                                 \n10 Weiss (2003) finds that the key factor influencing rural poverty reduction in PRC across \nprovinces has been the growth of agricultural production and to a lesser extent the trend in farm-\ngate prices. \n\n \n\n10\n\n\fscholarshipsc \n\nsecondary \nscholarshipsc \n\nHealth \ncardsd \n\nNutritione \n\nNotes  \n\nUpper \n\n6.4 \n\n5.4 \n\n2.0 \n\n3.7 \n\n0.71 \n\n0.90 \n\n27.6 \n\n10.6 \n\n3.1 \n\n6.3 \n\n0.67 \n\n0.83 \n\n20.0 \n\n16.5 \n\n14.2 \n\n15.9 \n\n0.79 \n\n0.99 \n\n Source : Sumarto et al (2001) \n\na) Targeting Ratio is share of non- poor (defined as those above bottom quintile) in \n\ntotal beneficiaries to their share in total population, which is 0.80 by definition. \n\nb)  Subsidized rice and employment creation programs potentially available to all \n\nc)  Scholarships are potentially available to all individual pupils enrolled at the \n\nhouseholds. \n\nrelevant levels. \n\nd)  Health cards potentially available to all those individuals who were estimated to \n\nhave visited a healthcare provider in the three months prior to the survey. \n\ne)  Nutrition support potentially available to all individuals in the \u2018pregnant women \n\nand children under three years\u2019 category. \n\nThe data are extremely detailed and reveal clearly that of the anti-poverty programs over \nthe period only the subsidized ration scheme reached a significant proportion of those \neligible (40%). Subsidized rice reached over 50% of households in the bottom quintile, \nbut for all other schemes the proportion of the target group reached was below 20% and \noften well below it. Hence under-coverage was clearly a problem. In terms of leakage \nthis was most serious for the rice and nutrition programs, where gains to the richest 20% \nwere high and the ratio of non-poor beneficiaries to their share in total population was \nhighest (nearly 1.0 for the nutrition program implying nearly zero targeting effectiveness), \nalthough these figures do not reveal the magnitude of gains per family, only whether \nthey were in receipt of some benefits. \n \n Self-targeting schemes were intended to overcome many of the problems faced by \ndirected or narrowly targeting. Nonetheless they have also proved disappointing in many \ncases. In India there has been considerable experience with food for work and \nemployment creation programs designed to attract the poor by offering below market-\nclearing wage rates.  Evaluations have revealed serious under-coverage. In the 1990s \nthe Employment Assurance Scheme offered on average only 17 days of employment \nper person per year against a target of 100 days. Further its village coverage was low \nwith another evaluation finding no more than one third of eligible villages actually \ncovered. This meant that in some states less than 10% of the target group was reached. \nThis, combined with the low number of days work on offer under the scheme, rendered \n\n \n\n \n\n11\n\n\fits overall impact on the welfare of the poor largely minimal. In this case part of the \nproblem had to do with the slow release of central government funds to the states and \npart to lack of matching funding by the states themselves (Srivastava, 2005). In other \nschemes, however, the level of wages set for employment has been identified as a \ncritical factor with relatively high and therefore attractive wages leading to a \u2018crowding \nout\u2019 of the poor.  In India under the food for work scheme in a survey in Andhra Pradesh, \nDeshingkar and Johnson (2003) conclude that wages either in cash or in kind were set \ntoo low in prosperous villages thus attracting non-poor migrants, but too high in poorer \nvillages leading to crowding out of the poor. A similar conclusion is reached for an \nIndonesian employment creation scheme (the Padat Karya). An evaluation of this, \ndrawing again on the (SUSENAS) data, found that for the 1998-99 period, as many as \n70% of beneficiaries were from non-poor households (Perdana and Maxwell, 2005). \n \n Micro credit programs aimed at the poor have a substantial element of self-targeting \ninsofar as they involve the potential embarrassment of clients being associated with \npoverty programs and the inconvenience of frequent group meetings. Micro-credit, is \nseen by many in the development community, as an important innovation in the fight \nagainst poverty (Morduch, 2000). There is now considerable evidence that micro credit \nhas had a positive impact on poverty reduction in a number of countries, although often \nit is not the \u2018core poor\u2019 who are the main recipients, but rather those close to or just \nabove the poverty line (Weiss et al 2004). However this leakage appears to be much \nless than from conventional subsidized credit programs. For example, for PRC the \nsubsidized loan program available for poor counties went principally to economic entities \nrather than poor households (although formally it was an obligation that recipient \nenterprises should have at least 50% of their employees who were below the poverty \nline). Many of these loans went to Township and Village Enterprises in poor counties \nand the direct link with poverty reduction came to be questioned. The introduction of \nmicro credit schemes in PRC in 1997 was a direct response to this concern (Wang \n2005). In the Philippines an assessment of the main low interest credit program for the \npoor (the Tulong sa Tao program) of the Aquino administration concluded that targeting \nwas vague and that only around one-third of beneficiaries were from low income groups \n(let alone being amongst the core poor) (Balisacan et al 2000). Similar assessments are \ngiven for such schemes in India. For example, an assessment of the Integrated Rural \nDevelopment program, which was designed to provide subsidized credit to the poor for \nincome generating activities, found that in the states of Bihar and Jharkand, 24% of \nbeneficiaries were above the poverty line and a high proportion had incomes just below \nit (MAKAR 2002). \n \nFinally, broad targeting based on types of expenditure, which the poor will use \ndisproportionately, offers an alternative to the type of narrow targeted schemes \ndiscussed above. Assessing the impact of measures like health and education \nexpenditure is normally done by \u2018benefit incidence analysis\u2019 (van de Walle 1998a). A \ntypical conclusion being that primary health care and primary education expenditure \nhave a disproportionate positive effect on the poor, whilst expenditure on hospitals and \nhigher education have a disproportionate positive effect on the better-off.11 The net effect \n\n                                                 \n11 van de Walle (1998b) reports this result for Indonesian data from the late 1980\u2019s, although the \nbias is much greater for hospitals where gains to the top decile of the income strata in monetary \nterms are roughly seven times those to the bottom decile. World Bank (2004) figure 2.5 reports \nestimates for Indonesia in 1989 and 1990 showing the gains to the poor (the bottom 20%) from \n\n \n\n12\n\n\fof aggregate health and education spending will vary therefore depending on how \nexpenditure is allocated within the sector, but in general there is evidence that broad \ntargeting within these sectors can reach poor.  \n \n \nEvidence on targeting projects \n \nThe limited evidence we have tends to be on cost effectiveness, that is costs per unit of \nbenefit received by the poor (A/Bi). Even with this simpler approach few rigorous cost \neffectiveness studies of alternative targeting projects are available. In some instances \nbenefits are not fully specified (for example future gains from investment financed by \nmicrocredit or the long-run productive impact of improved health) and discounting may \nnot always be applied to take account of the time profile of impacts. Further a rigorous \ncomparator, in terms of a cut-off rate for costs per unit of benefit is normally unavailable. \n \n For India a comparison of employment guarantee schemes and food subsidies suggest \nthat at best the cost of transfer is nearly double the benefits received by the poor. \nApproximate estimates suggest that the cost of transferring a rupee to the poor through \nthe Maharashtra Employment Guarantee Scheme in its early years (Rs 1.85 per rupee \ntransferred) compared very favorably with both the later national employment scheme, \nthe Jawahar Rogzar Yojona, (Rs 2.28 per Rupee transferred) and the food subsidy \nprogram under the Public Distribution System  (Rs 6.68 per Rupee transferred) (Dev and \nEvenson, 2003). Separate estimates for impact of the Employment Assurance scheme \nin three states (West Bengal, Gujarat and Haryana) found the cost per job per day to be \nRs 200-Rs 300, which is well in excess of wage rates as rough estimate of benefit to the \npoor (assuming a zero opportunity cost of time and no costs for additional effort), which \nwere roughly in the range of Rs 35-50 (Srivastava 2005). \n \nThe operations of the National Food Authority in the Philippines, particularly through its \nrice subsidy, have been the subject of several cost effectiveness assessments. For the \nearly 1990\u2019s cost are again roughly twice the sum transferred to consumers (Subbarao \net al 1996). However NFA rice is sold in special retail outlets in a form of self-targeting \nand much will leak to the non-poor. Assuming a 50% leakage rate more recent cost \neffectiveness estimates for the NFA rice subsidy suggest that in 1997 it costs Pesos 4.2 \nper peso of benefit received by poor consumers and Pesos 2.5 per peso of benefit in \n1998. Much of this mistargeting will have been due to a regional misallocation with some \nof the poorer provinces being under-represented, relative to their share in poverty, in the \nreceipt of NFA rice (Manasan, 2001).  \n \n\nThere is often a general expectation that microfinance institutions are an effective \nmeans of reaching the poor, although for the countries surveyed here there are few full \ncost effectiveness studies. For India, Burgess and Pande (2003) examine whether the \npattern of commercial bank expansion in India into rural areas, previously not served by \nbanks, has impacted on rural poverty and their work allows a simple comparison with \nmicrofinance. Their estimates suggest that it costs 2.72 rupees to generate an additional \nrupee of income for the poor via the \u2018social banking initiative\u2019 of the commercial banks. \nMore detailed work on microfinance institutions is available for Bangladesh, one of the \n\n                                                                                                                                                 \npublic spending to exceed the gains to the rich (the top 20%) for primary health care and primary \neducation expenditure, whilst the reverse holds for aggregate expenditure under both headings.  \n\n \n\n13\n\n\fkey centers for microfinance in Asia, and several studies allow a comparison both \nbetween different micro finance institutions and between microfinance and other projects \nto reach the poor (see table 3). Khandker (1998) compares the cost-effectiveness of \nmicro credit in Bangladesh (that is costs per taka of consumption for the poor) as \ncompared with more formal financial institutions and other poverty-targeted \ninterventions. They appear to be based on the assumption of a zero leakage rate to the \nnon-poor. The interesting result that emerges is that the Grameen Bank is considerably \nmore effective than the other main institution the Bangladesh Rural Advancement \nCommittee (BRAC) and that as expected loans to female borrowers are considerably \nmore cost-effective than loans to males. Further, subsidies to Grameen (but not to \nBRAC) appear to be a more cost effective means of reaching the poor than various food \nfor work programs. However a food for education scheme appeared very cost- effective \nrelative to the food for work programs and to BRAC.  Formal financial institutions than \noffer small loans to the poor are less cost-effective than Grameen for both female and \nmale borrowers and less cost effective than BRAC in some, both not all, cases \nexamined (Khandker 1998:134-139). The high figure for BRAC is in part due to the \nrange of services, such as training, offered in addition to micro credit, but nonetheless if \nsuch services are essential to the success of micro credit, including their cost in a cost-\nbenefit assessment of micro-credit is legitimate. 12 \n \n\nTable 3 Cost effectiveness ratiosa: Bangladesh early 1990\u2019s \n\nIntervention  \n\nFemale  \n\nAll borrowers \n\nGrameen Bank  \n\nBRAC \n\nAgricultural \n\nDevelopment bank \n\n(BKB)b \n\nAgricultural \n\nDevelopment bank \n\n(RAKUB)c \n\nVulnerable Group \n\nDevelopment \n\n0.91 \n\n3.53 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMale \n\n1.48 \n\n2.59 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4.88 \n\n3.26 \n\n1.54 \n\n                                                 \n12 Khandker does not conclude from this that all subsidies to other poverty interventions should \nbe withdrawn and reallocated to micro-finance. Rather he points out that as participants to micro \ncredit borrowing self-select (that is they judge that micro credit suits their particular needs, often \nfor self employed work) others amongst the poor may not be able to benefit. For this latter group \nother forms of targeting will still be required.   \n\n \n\n14\n\n\fFood for Work d \n\nFood for Work (World \n\nFood Program) \n\nFood for Educatione \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.62 \n\n1.71 \n\n0.94 (1.79) \n\nSource: Khandker (1998) tables 7.2 and 7.3 and Wodon (1998) \n\nNotes:  a) Ratio of costs to income gains to the poor. \n\n              b) Bangladesh Krishi bank \n\n             c) Rajshahi Krishi Unnayan bank   \n\n             d) Run on behalf of USAID \n\n             e) Source for this data is Wodon (1998); figure in brackets is the cost \n\neffectiveness ratio         for the very poor. \n\n \nA further look at the effectiveness of Grameen is provided by Schreiner (2003), who \ncalculates the subsidy-lending ratio at 0.22 over the period 1983-97. This is not directly \nequivalent to the ratios in table 3, but assuming the same return to borrowing as in \nKhandker (1998) these figures can be converted into a broadly equivalent ratio of cost to \ngains to the poor of 1.15. This is consistent with the figures in table 3 which would need \nto be averaged to give an overall return to male and female borrowing combined. The \nresult confirms Grameen as a relatively cost-effective form of poverty intervention.  \n \nNone of these studies provide a reference or cut-off point so that one cannot judge \nwhether a more cost-effective alternative for providing resources to the poor was \navailable. Neither do they throw any light on the distribution of gains within the group the \npoor. Few attempts have been made to assess the social returns to poverty projects in \nthese economies, in part because they have often been assumed to be distribution \nrather than growth-focused. However some estimates are available from the PRC, \nlargely because the poverty program there was largely designed around poverty loans \nfor productive activities located in areas where poverty was judged to be prevalent (the \n\u2018poor counties\u2019). In all cases these studies use regression models to explain income \nchange and relate this change to project costs to derive a social return, in terms of \nchanges in incomes within the poor counties (although there is no evidence on who \nwithin these areas receives benefits and no social weights are applied). From a \nregression model Rozelle et al (1998) find some positive income effects from direct \nlending to households in poor counties in Shaanxi 1986-91, however funds allocated \ndirectly to enterprises in these counties do not appear to have any positive effect on \ngrowth. Zhang et al (2002) look at Sichuan province and compare growth across \nprogram poor, non-program poor and non-poor counties. Allowing for a range of others \nfactors they find that program status does appear to have a positive effect on growth. \nHence, whilst non-poor counties grew more rapidly, the gap between poor and non-poor \ncounties is lower when counties have a designated poor status and receive poverty \n\n \n\n15\n\n\ffunding commensurate with this designation. An even stronger result is provided by Park \net al (2002) using a regression model, which makes growth across counties a function of \ninitial income, other initial characteristics (principally grain production), time invariant \ncharacteristics, including poor county status, and a number time-varying factors. They \nfind that designation as a poor county increases household per capita income, over that \notherwise expected, by 2.2 % annually 1986-92 and 0.9% annually 1992-95. When this \nrate of increase is compared with the amount of funding to poor counties this gives a \nrate of return of between 12% and 16% depending on the time period. \n \n \nConclusions \n \nWhat can one conclude from all of this for targeting policy? The need to reach the poor \ndirectly and to minimize leakage from and under-coverage of poverty programs remains \ncritical. Self-targeting initiatives have proved only a modest improvement in leakage \nterms and raise issues of under-coverage. Technical improvements, principally new \npoverty mapping techniques, offer a means of more sharply identifying who the poor are, \nbut in the absence of strong governance over poverty schemes the risk of misuse of \nfunds remains. Whilst the case for special promotion and protection policies for the poor \nremains strong, past errors associated with their implementation and design must not be \nforgotten. In the debates of the 1980\u2019s more universal schemes were strongly criticized \nfor their high leakage and their budgetary implications. The more targeted measures of \nthe 1990\u2019s as we have seen, have cost more modest amounts relative to the size of \ngovernment budgets, but their leakage rates have also been disappointingly high, as \nhave been their costs per unit of benefit to the poor, where these can be estimated.  \n \nNonetheless some of these schemes may nonetheless have been influential in \nprotecting the poor at times of adverse shocks. This is the judgement, for example, on \nsome of the many schemes introduced in Indonesia at the time of the Crisis of the late \n1990\u2019s, particularly in relation to health and education initiatives. There is some evidence \nthat the education scholarship program helped in keeping up school enrolment rates and \nreducing drop-out rates from poor families. Similarly the health card scheme to allow free \naccess to public health facilities is credited with stabilizing the utilization rate of such \nfacilities by the poor. Cost and leakage may have been high, but some real benefits \nappear to have been created.  \n \nIt is perhaps not widely appreciated that under many widely cited weighting schemes \neven the relatively high cost interventions examined here, may still be justifiable in \nwelfare terms, since if one introduces a form of social weighting (as in equation (1) \nabove) it is not difficult to rationalize even apparently high cost schemes. For example, \nwhere the average income per capita is twice the poverty line, using the weighting \nscheme with n = 2  in equation (2) those on the poverty line will have a weight four times \nthe average. Hence if one accepts this set of weights a project funded by taxing average \nconsumers and transferring resources to the poor, could have a cost effectiveness ratio \nof somewhere between 3 and 4 to one unit of benefit to the poor and still be socially \nacceptable. This is not an argument for ignoring the cost-effectiveness of poverty \nprojects, but the strong implication is that poverty targeting projects should remain an \nimportant component of poverty reduction strategies, although improvements in both \ngovernance and the technical design of schemes are needed. This is likely to require a \ncombination of greater focus on broad targeting (primary education and health care, for \nexample) and selective narrowly focused support for the very poor. Broad targeting \n\n \n\n16\n\n\fmeasures, such as expenditure on primary health care, have been shown to reach the \npoor disproportionately, in a number of countries and clearly have an important role.  \nSuch measures are not solutions to the short-term problem of providing protection to the \npoor, which is why measures like employment creation schemes and food subsidies \nhave been employed, with the disappointing results that we have observed. However \nwhat works and what does not, is likely to vary substantially between countries. The \ncase for their abandonment has not been demonstrated, although that for their \nimprovement is very strong. \n \n\n \n\n17\n\n\fBibliography \n \nBalisacan, A.

Such schemes can range from the \nprovision of infrastructure, subsidized food, employment creation, access to health and \nother social facilities, microfinance and occasionally cash grants. Types of targeting \ninclude that by activity, such as primary health care and primary education, where it is \nestablished that the distribution of benefits tends to be progressive (so-called \u2018broad \ntargeting\u2019), by indicator, where alternatives to income that may be expected to be \ncorrelated with poverty are used to identify the poor, by location, where area of \nresidence becomes the criteria for identifying the target group, and self-targeting, where \nprograms are designed to be attractive only to the poor.  Insofar as these measures all \ninvolve the use of public resources to achieve benefits for a target group at or below the \npoverty line they can be thought of a \u2018poverty projects,\u2019 whose efficiency in principle \nshould be amenable to formal quantification. \n \nPoverty targeted interventions achieved prominence in development initiatives in the \n1990\u2019s in part due to the demonstrated weakness of universal schemes with high \nleakage rates and in part due to fiscal pressures that undermined governments\u2019 ability to \nfunds large universal programs (World Bank 1990).1 This paper surveys briefly evidence \non the impact of poverty projects in a number of large economies in South Asia (India), \nSouth East Asia (Thailand, Philippines and Indonesia) as well as in People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC), drawing on the detailed studies in Weiss (2005). In some of these \ncountries poverty targeting has a relatively long history stemming from longstanding \nsocial welfare concerns (India and to some extent the Philippines and PRC), whilst \nelsewhere it originated principally in the late 1990\u2019s in response to the impact of the \nregional Financial Crisis (Thailand and Indonesia). The paper begins with a digression \non methodology, before giving an overview of the quantitative importance of such \nprojects. It then highlights difficulties in relation to identification of the poor, and errors of \ntargeting relating to both misappropriation and technical errors causing under-coverage \nand leakage. Finally we draw some conclusions.   \n \n \nAppraisal methodology for poverty projects \n \nA basic distinction in the targeting literature is between two forms of error, that of under-\ncoverage, that is the failure to reach some of the target group, and of leakage, that is \nwhere benefits accrue to those outside the target group. Following statistical terminology \nthese are termed \u2018type 1\u2019 and \u2018type 2\u2019 errors, respectively. Practical application of \ntargeting measures inevitably involves some trade-off between these two errors. For \nexample to minimize undercoverage or type 1 error more generous means of assessing \n", "                                                 \n1 Besley and Kanpur (1991) introduce the theory of targeting in a development context. Finely \ntargeted schemes imply high administrative costs for their operation and in general there will be \nan expectation that the more finely targeted these are (that is the lower is the degree of leakage) \nthe higher will be the ratio of administrative costs to benefits to the poor. This has the important \nimplication that the optimal degree of targeting need not be to be aim for the minimum degree of \nleakage, since the costs of such targeting need to be compared with the benefits. \n", " \n", "2\n", "eligibility may be used, whilst to minimize leakage or type 2 error, stricter criteria may be \napplied, and if these are not specified or applied correctly they may serve to exclude \nsome of the target group (Cornia and Stewart 1993). \n \nIf the objective of a project is to channel resources to the poor and it suffers from type 1 \nand  type 2 errors, as noted above, such projects may have low social returns? However \nquantifying project impact has rarely been done with any rigor and there are important \nconceptual issues to be addressed. For example, if one wishes to estimate a social \nreturn to such a project strictly one must identify the full distribution of the benefits from \nthe project. As the poor are the target group they are explicitly favored, with the \nimplication that benefits they receive have a higher social value than benefits received or \ncosts incurred by those who are above the poverty line. Hence full social appraisal \nrequires not only that all project effects (both short term and long- term) be monetized, \nbut that benefits be adjusted by a set of social weights that reflect an aversion to \ninequality or poverty (or both). These weighted benefits must then be compared with the \nfull costs of the targeting project, both administrative and running costs of the project and \ncosts of additional government financing (for example through taxation or bond issue) if \nit is a project that is incremental to the budget. Hence social efficiency E can be \nexpressed as  \n \n", "E =        \u03a3i(di* Bi)  + \u03a3j(dj*Bj)   -  \u03a3jdj*A( 1 + t)                                              (1) \n \nWhere Bi and Bj are the present value of benefits to groups i (the poor) and j (the \nnon-poor), respectively, di and dj are the social weights for gains to these groups, A is \nthe present value of the administrative and running costs of a project and t is the cost of \nadditional financing as a proportion of the funds required. An efficient project requires \nE>0.  \n \nThe greater is leakage the larger will be Bj relative to Bi, and the greater is under-\ncoverage the lower will be Bi relative to its potential. A time profile of impacts is required \nand this will vary greatly between targeting interventions; food subsidies or employment \nschemes, for example, will provide immediate consumption, whilst microfinance and \nhealth cards will longer-term impacts. Long-run impacts are not always more desirable, if \na short-term transfer can forestall catastrophic consequences, like starvation, although \nthis raises complex problem of valuation, where life saving effects are involved and an \nappropriate discount rate will be needed.2  \n", " \nThe groups the poor and non-poor can be treated as homogenous or broken down by \nliving standard. In the first case there will be simply two weights di and dj, but in the latter \ncase there will be a range for all i and all j. The theoretical literature has offered as the \nmain solution to the weighting problem, a continuous weighting function based on \ndiminishing marginal utility of consumption at a constant elasticity.  This requires a \nreference point (for example, the poverty line consumption level) as the numeraire and \nan elasticity parameter reflecting the degree of aversion to inequality. \n", "                                                 \n2 The theory underlying this exposition is in Squire and van der Tak (1975), with a restatement in \nBrent (1990) and Curry and Weiss (2000). Complications related to the costs of raising public \nfunding to cover A and who bears this cost, can be removed if one assumes that there is a fixed \ngovernment budget irrespective of choice project so that the costs of raising A are the same, \nwhichever project is implemented. \n", " \n", " \n", "3\n"]}
