Over time, the economy has taken center stage and the ASEAN Economic \nCommunity (AEC) is going to be launched in 2015. The AEC is a milestone promoting ASEAN \neconomic integration and centrality, but it alone is insufficient for the group to retain relevance \nin an increasingly multipolar world. This paper suggests that ASEAN needs an ambitious plan \nfor economic integration beyond the AEC to achieve its economic development aspirations. \nAs ASEAN designs its post-2015 agenda with a view to strengthening its role as a hub of Asian \ndynamism, its members need to adopt an appropriate policy mix including deep domestic \nstructural reforms and bold actions to further deepen regional integration\u2014transforming the \nAEC into a truly borderless economic community. \nKeywords: ASEAN, regional economic integration, development aspirations, post-2015 agenda\nJEL codes: F4, F55, O53, R11", "", "The ASEAN Economy in the Regional Context: Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Options   |   1\n1. Introduction \nAs the global economy recovered from the 2008/09 financial crisis, analysts converged on the \nnotion that Asia has emerged as the growth engine of the world. A recent study commissioned by \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) projected the possibility that by 2050 Asia\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) will exceed 50% of the world\u2019s total, making this century an \u201cAsian\u201d century \n(Kholi et al. 2011). While a debate on the foundations of the Asian century is still ongoing, the \nregion\u2019s economies continue to perform far better than the world\u2019s average. Within Asia, Japan \nmay have finally exited a deflationary trap and seems to be ready to enter a new era of growth. \nAt the same time, despite huge internal and external challenges, the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) and India continue to perform as two giant poles for economic dynamism in Asia and the \nworld (ADB/ADBI 2014). The Republic of Korea; Taipei,China; and Hong Kong, China are also \non track of sustained development with great improvement in people\u2019s quality of life. \nIn this context, the economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are \nshowing strong macroeconomic fundamentals and robust economic growth. As a group, they \nhave a large internal market, with a rapidly expanding middle class. They are also implementing \nan ambitious plan to create an ASEAN Economic Community (AEC)\u2014a single market and \nproduction base\u2014by 2015. Although marked by great diversity within and across member \neconomies, since its establishment in 1967 the group was able to strengthen its role to maintain \npeace and security in the region, eventually gaining centrality in Asia\u2019s architecture for economic \nand political cooperation. \nAs Asia\u2019s economy continues its rapid growth, ASEAN member economies will be facing both \nopportunities and challenges. In particular, the rise of the PRC and (more recently) India has \ngenerated serious concerns among some economists and political scientists who, conscious of \nASEAN\u2019s internal weaknesses, warned against the possible erosion of competitive advantages \nand loss of the region\u2019s central position.\nThis paper takes, however, a more positive view. It argues that the rise of the PRC and India creates \npotentially much higher opportunities for ASEAN member economies than the challenges it \nposes. Increasing economic interdependence with the PRC and India creates opportunities to \nexpand ASEAN\u2019s markets for goods and services and improve economic and financial stability \nthrough diversification of risk outside traditional economic partners such as the United States \n(US) and the European Union (EU). At the same time, however, the rising weight of the PRC\u2019s \nand India\u2019s economies creates a threat to ASEAN, imposing a shift in comparative advantages \nand causing the possible erosion of the pivotal role ASEAN has been playing in Asia\u2019s architecture \nfor integration. \nTo  address  these  challenges,  ASEAN  economies  need  to  introduce  a  two-track  strategy \nincluding domestic reforms to facilitate economic restructuring and liberalization, and initiatives \nto deepen and widen regional integration, leading to higher productivity and cost reductions \nthrough economies of scale and network externalities. Domestic policies need to enhance \ncompetitiveness and productivity by leveraging on regional production networks and substantially ", "2   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 145\nincreasing investment in human capital and research and development (R&D) to upgrade their \ntechnological capabilities. In turn, such investment will also help ASEAN economies from falling \ninto the middle-income trap, which remains a major threat for economies such as Thailand, \nMalaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. \nIn order to remain relevant in a region increasingly dominated by the PRC and India, and \nwhere Japan and the Republic of Korea maintain technological leadership, ASEAN member \neconomiesneed to close their ranks, strengthen regional institutions, and move beyond the AEC \nby creating a truly borderless economic community. Free trade and investment agreements \n(FTAs), which have proliferated in the last few years, can also greatly help binding the region \ntogether and promote further improvements in competitiveness and productivity. \n2. The ASEAN Economy in the Regional Context\nASEAN was established almost 50 years ago mainly for political and security reasons. Economic \nand social issues started attracting the attention of its members only after the first leaders\u2019 \nSummit in 1976. Today, ASEAN constitutes an overarching regional institution with several \nactivities and initiatives in a wide-range of functional areas (ADB 2010). Its member economies \nare working to accomplish the ambitious plan to create an ASEAN Community by the year 2015, \nformed by three pillars: (i) the political-security community, (ii) the socio-cultural community, \nand (iii) the AEC.\nToday, the ten ASEAN member economies form a major economic bloc. In 2012, their combined \nGDP was above $2.3 trillion, or 3.2% of the world\u2019s total\u2014a share which doubled from 1990. In \nthe same year, with a total population of 620 million (around 9% of the world\u2019s total), ASEAN\u2019s \naverage per-capita income at market prices was close to $3,800, between that of India ($1,600) \nand the PRC ($6,100), or to about one-third the global average\u2014up from one-fifth in 1990 \n(Table 1).1 \nA relatively large and still young population, with a growing middle class of well over 100 million \npeople, represents one of ASEAN\u2019s major strengths. Its member economies are also strategically \nlocated in the heart of Asia, connected to the PRC and India through maritime and land routes, \nand blessed with abundant natural resources\u2014including oil, gas, hydropower, and minerals\u2014a \nlarge biodiversity, and a substantial agricultural base. \n1   ASEAN\u2019s total land mass in 2012 was more than 4,300 square kilometers (about 1.5 times that of India and \n0.5\u00a0times that of the People\u2019s Republic of China).", "The ASEAN Economy in the Regional Context: Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Options   |   3\nTable 1.

The differences \nacross and within ASEAN economies are indeed huge. For example, in 2012 Singapore\u2019s per-\ncapita GDP (at market prices) was almost 60 times that of Myanmar, while Indonesia had a \npopulation more than 611 times bigger than that of Brunei Darussalam\u2014with a land area 340 \ntimes larger. Development gaps within and across ASEAN economies are indeed remarkable, \nparticularly between rural and urban areas, as well as in archipelagic regions such as Luzon and \nMindanao in the Philippines or the Western and Eastern provinces of Indonesia. \nDisparities  remain  pronounced  in  governance  systems  and  in  the  capacity  to  effectively \nimplement the rule of law. Indicators of economic and social development, such as the human \ndevelopment index, the infrastructure efficiency index, and the ease of doing business index, \nall show pronounced diversity in individual economies\u2019 performance (Table 2), with important \nimplications in meeting the targets to form the AEC by 2015. Needless to say, the challenges \nto create a \u201csingle market and production base\u201d expand with greater regional diversity, which \nmakes it difficult for member economies to proceed along similar tracks of liberalization and \nintegration, using similar timeframes.\nFour ASEAN member economies (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand) have \nachieved middle income status a few years ago, positioning themselves along a wide range of \nper-capita GDP levels from $2,500 in the Philippines to more than $10,000 in Malaysia. Viet \nNam has recently entered the lower middle income status, with a per-capita income above \n$1,500, while Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR), and Myanmar remain \nlow income economies, with major pockets of poverty\u2014although in these economies economic \ngrowth has been accelerating with a fast improvement in living standards. \nAll ASEAN economies have rapidly internationalized during the past decades. Viet Nam has \nshown, in particular, a dramatic increase in its degree of trade openness (total exports plus \nimports over GDP), from 24% in 1985 to 160% in 2012. During the same period, trade has risen \nfrom 42% to 47% of GDP in the PRC, while in India it has more than doubled from 17% of GDP to \n40%\u2014both very large shares given the large size of these two economies2 (Figure 1).\nStrengthening regional trade and investment\nContinuous progress in trade and investment liberalization and the creation of regional production \nnetworks are two main factors driving the trend toward ASEAN economies\u2019 increased global \nand regional interdependence. Within East Asia, the PRC has been expanding its role as a major \nassembly site for manufactures, which has contributed to a continue rise in its share of global \ntrade from 2% in 1990 to 11.5% in 2012.

Indonesia (21% of the total), Thailand, Malaysia, and \nViet\u00a0Nam were, in order, the other most preferred destinations.3 \nEvolving macroeconomic policies\nFollowing the rapid economic growth experienced by Asian economies over the 15 years after \nthe financial crisis of 1997/98, the center of global economic gravity has been shifting toward \nAsia (ADB 2008). This trend, accompanied by a rebalancing of the sources of growth from \nexports toward the region\u2019s internal demand, is likely to continue over the coming decades. \nThis process was hastened by the 2008/09 global financial crisis and the eurozone crisis. While \nadvanced economies have entered a prolonged period of subdued growth, emerging Asia is are \nexpected to continue its expansion, even as the region remains vulnerable to external shocks \nand economies continue facing the challenges of adopting more sustainable and inclusive \ndevelopment strategies. \n3  The recipient economies\u2019 shares of total FDI to ASEAN is calculated from data available at the United National \nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), which estimates the total FDI stock to ASEAN for the period \n1970-2012 at USD 1.4 trillion.", "10   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 145\nIn the aftermath of the 2008/09 global financial crisis, advanced economies\u2019 central banks used \nunconventional monetary easing policies to spur activity in their economies as they were facing \nlong-term sluggish growth, high unemployment, and debt restructuring. These policies resulted \nin a significant surge in global liquidity, sudden exchange rate re-alignments, and large swings in \nliquidity generating spillover effects on emerging markets exposed to potential volatility. High \nliquidity and low interest rates in advanced economies led to large capital outflows, leaving \nASEAN economies, as well as other emerging markets, exposed to possible overheating, excessive \ngrowth of credit, greater exposure to bank loans, and weakening overall macroeconomic and \nfinancial stability. \nThe capacity to use appropriate macroprudential policy has become therefore a critical element \nin managing ASEAN economies (Sussangkarn 2003). Similar to the events unfolding after \nthe crisis of 1997/98, ASEAN member economies\u2014and India\u2014have largely pursued market-\nbased exchange rate regimes, whereas the yuan appreciation against the US dollar has been \ntightly managed. With current account surpluses and capital inflows, it is possible that ASEAN \ncurrencies will continue to appreciate vis-\u00e0-vis the dollar as well as the yuan, thus weakening \ntheir  competitiveness  against  other  regional  currencies.  Overall,  sluggish  export  demand \nfrom advanced economies increases competitive pressure from the PRC, India, and other \nemerging markets. As they react to changing external conditions, ASEAN economies\u2019 possible \nintervention in currency markets needs to be closely coordinated as it may eventually distort \nprice competitiveness and disrupt the underlying stability that is the foundation for smooth \nfunctioning regional production networks.\nThe various levels of macroeconomic vulnerabilities ASEAN economies are exposed to reveal \nother important dimensions of the group\u2019s pronounced diversity. Macroeconomic conditions \nin ASEAN+64\u2014with far better data availability and reliability than in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, \nMyanmar, and Viet Nam (CLMV economies)\u2014are in general quite robust, with current account \nsurpluses in all economies but Indonesia, relatively strong external reserve positions, low-to-\nmoderate public debt (with the notable exception of Singapore), and relatively sound banking \nsectors in terms of capital adequacy ratios and non-performing loans. CLMV economies, \nhowever, show greater vulnerability than the ASEAN6 due to high external and fiscal deficits, \nwith moderate-to-low gross official reserves. Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam have also \nlimited degrees of freedom in using monetary policy tools, due to the high degree of dollarization \nof their economies. \nAt the same time, fiscal sustainability is a potential policy issue for several ASEAN economies \ngiven their high public deficits. A number of ASEAN economies where monetary indicators have \ngrown rapidly are also facing a challenge in managing the risk of asset bubbles, as reflected in \nmonetary growth indicators. Data show Viet Nam, Cambodia, and Lao PDR must pay special \nattention to monitor their macroeconomic developments going forward, while Malaysia, the \n4  ASEAN+6 refers to Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand\u2014the first six \nASEAN member states.

Table 4, \nwhich compares key financial sector indicators for ASEAN economies with other major Asian \neconomies in 2002 and 2012, shows that Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand rank close to Japan \nand the Republic of Korea, while Viet Nam and the Philippines fall next to the PRC and India, with \nTable 3.

Data also show that ASEAN financial systems are largely \nbank-based, with stock markets expanding in terms of their relative importance, especially in \nthe six economies shown in the table.5 Although ASEAN equity markets are more developed \nthan bonds\u2019, none of the regional exchanges\u2014except for Singapore\u2014are among the world\u2019s \n20 largest financial centers in terms of either trading value or capitalization.

During the same period, the PRC economy is expected to grow at an average 8.6% per year \nand India\u2019s at an average 7.9% per year (Figure 6).\n3. ASEAN Toward 2030\nA recent Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) study conducted in collaboration with the \nASEAN Secretariat and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) projects the growth of the ASEAN \neconomy to 2030, analyzing individual member economies\u2019 aspirations and challenges moving \nforward (ADBI 2014). The study also provides recommendations for policymakers\u2014its main \nmessage is that ASEAN urgently needs a plan beyond the AEC and that the strategy ought to be \nin the direction of strengthening regional integration and creating a truly borderless economic \ncommunity. The study suggests that ASEAN member economies need not only to further \nliberalize the movement of goods, services, capital and people across their economies as well \nas harmonize and standardize rules and regulations region-wide: they also need to strengthen \nregional institutional bodies, with national agencies delegating more powers to enable them to ", "14   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 145\neffectively implement regional cooperation initiatives, including fully implementing the AEC \nBlueprints. \nWith  pressing  competition  from  the  PRC  and  India\u2014as  well  as  other  Asian  emerging \neconomies\u2014ASEAN economies need to close their ranks and boost competitiveness and \nproductivity by forming a tighter regional block able to generate sizeable economies of scale \nand capture network externalities. They must ensure the ability for firms and individuals to trade \nand travel across ASEAN borders, allowing information to flow through a seamless network of \ncommunications. ASEAN member economies have to more efficiently manage scarce natural \nresources, protect the environment, and ensure food and energy security. Eventually, they also \nneed to develop a stronger sense of community among themselves, with ASEAN acting as a \nclosely-knit family of nations. \nAspirations moving forward\n2030 economic perspectives are provided by a set of projections prepared by the ADB and \nindividual economies\u2019 aspirations obtained through stakeholders\u2019 consultations and analysis \nconducted by local experts, including economies\u2019 own development strategies. \nThe outcome of this exercise indicates that ASEAN economies have reached a major crossroads. \nBy introducing deep structural reforms domestically and through more determined efforts \nfor regional economic integration, they can enter the path of a positive scenario (defined by \naspiration targets) leading to tripling per-capita incomes between 2010 and 2030 and raising \ncitizens\u2019 quality of life to levels enjoyed today by average members of the Organisation for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD). In the absence, however, of such policies, \nASEAN economies will face a negative scenario with subdued GDP growth to an average 3% per \nannum over the two decades, and several economies falling in the middle-income trap as they \nfail to invest in R&D and education (ADBI 2014). This negative scenario is also defined by the \ninability to manage pressing challenges posed by climate change and increasing natural disasters, \nand to solve mounting political tensions, both within and across economies.

If these economies will introduce the right policies allowing them to follow a \ndevelopment path similar to that of Japan in the first decades after the Second World War and \nof the Republic of Korea more recently, they may avoid the middle-income trap and join the \ngroup of economies driving global growth and prosperity. This may in turn inspire Cambodia, the \nLao PDR, and Myanmar entering a similar growth path following the example of other ASEAN \nmember economies. In this context, adopting the two-track strategy suggested in the ADBI \nstudy\u2014domestic structural reforms and bold initiatives for regional integration\u2014is important \nto strengthen ASEAN economies\u2019 competitive edge and leverage at the same time on the \nopportunities created by growth in other Asian economies. \nADB\u2019s projections for GDP growth in the current decade and the next suggest that while ASEAN \nmay expand at an average 5.4% during 2010-2030, India\u2019s economy will likely grow at an average \n7.7% every year, and the PRC by 7.0% over the same period. While GDP growth in ASEAN is \nexpected to remain quite stable during these years, both India and the PRC will likely slow down \ntheir average rates in the second decade, with the PRC entering a new growth normal within the \n6% level (Figure 8).6 \n6  The level for ASEAN economies is approximately 1 percentage point below the aspiration target shown in Figure\u00a07.", "16   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 145\nFigure 8.

Projections \nfor the period 2011-2020 and 2021-2030 are provided by ADB\u2019s Economics and \nResearch Department, January 2013.\nWhile GDP growth rates are an important measure to assess economic development, improvement \nin citizens\u2019 quality of life should be observed through a broader set of concepts and indicators. \nMalaysia has already developed its own \u201cquality of life\u201d index, including measurements of several \nelements such as income and distribution, health, education, transport and communication, \nhousing, work-life balance, environment, public safety, social participation, culture and leisure, \nand family life. Several other ASEAN economies are in the process of introducing similar indexes \nin preparing their long-term economic development strategies.7 The ADBI study analyzed four \ndimensions of quality of life (income, health, education, and governance) to conclude that \nentering a positive growth scenario will imply reaching, by 2030, a quality of life similar to that \nenjoyed in 2010 by average OECD economies (ADBI. 2014).\n4. Opportunities and Challenges\nAsia\u2019s rapid growth and closer economic integration implies opportunities as well as challenges \nfor ASEAN member economies. On balance, the potential benefits outweigh the costs, as the \n7  The Human Development Index (HDI), shown in Table 2, is an early attempt to measure some key components of \nquality of life, started by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) back in 1980.", "The ASEAN Economy in the Regional Context: Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Options   |   17\nincome effect and creation of new markets induced by sustained economic expansion remains \nlarge compared with the substitution effect related to the evolving structures of comparative \nadvantages across the region, erosion of ASEAN economies\u2019 international competitiveness, and \nshrinking shares in exports and FDI inflows.\nOpportunities arising from regional economic interdependence\nASEAN\u2019s strategic location at the center of Asia offers the group the opportunity to serve as \na natural land bridge between East and South Asia\u2014especially between two of the world\u2019s \nmost  dynamic  markets:  the  PRC  and  India.8  Such  role  has  been  strengthened  since  the \ndramatic changes recently occurred in Myanmar, which led to the economy\u2019s opening up and \nnormalization through deep political and economic reforms, enhancing regional connectivity. \nIn the years running up to 2030, opportunities for ASEAN member economies to further grow \nthrough trade and investment will be enormous as the group creates its single market through \nthe AEC and new regional demand is generated by other Asian economies.\nA growing middle class, an aging population, and an increasing percentage of people living in urban \nareas are major trends defining Asia\u2019s future growth (Kholi, et al. 2011). Increased intraregional \neconomic interdependence creates a unique chance for ASEAN economies to exploit the PRC\u2019s \nand India\u2019s huge and rising domestic markets. The rapid expansion of a vast middle class in both \neconomies creates large opportunities for goods and services made in ASEAN, catering local \nconsumption. Recent estimates suggest that, by 2030, more than 1.2 billion people in the PRC \nand 1 billion people in India (respectively 85% and 70% of the population) will have reached \nmedium- or high-income levels (ADB/ADBI 2014). \nCloser interdependence is also important for ASEAN member economies to benefit from \nbuyer-supplier relations in production and distribution networks and technology transfer from \neconomies such as Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Taipei,China, which continue to invest in the \nregion\u2019s productive capacity and maintain leadership in many product and process technologies. \nIndeed, participation in regional supply chains helps create robust and competitive export sectors \nand offer significant opportunities for local SMEs\u2019 internationalization. As a matter of fact, one \nof key tenets to bypass the middle-income trap is to reduce reliance on foreign technologies \nby building a business climate that promotes investment in R&D and creates incentives for \ninnovation (Kholi, et al. 2001). Without progress in these areas, it will be hard for ASEAN to \nbecome a highly competitive region, also given the generally low educational attainment and the \nrelatively large proportion of unskilled labor in the total workforce. \nBeside manufacturing exports, changing patterns of Asian consumers are expected to benefit \nresource and agriculturally rich ASEAN economies. Rapidly rising energy and food demand from \nthe region hold large potential gains. Indeed, ASEAN maintains vast potential to increase the \nproduction and export of energy and food, allowing it to play an increasingly strategic role in \n8  Aside from the geographic position, ASEAN economies hold deep historical, cultural, and trade links with the rest \nof Asia, which facilitate gains from international relations.

By improving connectivity across the region (including \nhard and soft infrastructure plus institutions), ASEAN economies can also develop regional hubs \nin sectors such as tourism, health, education, logistics services, and financial \u00a0services.\nTourism, in particular, is one of the areas offering enormous potential for further growth. As \nshown in Figure 9, the number of tourists entering ASEAN economies has increased by 30% \nfrom 2007 to 2011, with a significant increase in the share of Asian tourists on the total. A recent \nreport of the United Nations\u2019 World Tourism Organizations (United Nations, 2012) suggests that \nbetween 2010 and 2030 ASEAN will experience an average 5.1% yearly increase in international \ntourist arrivals, surpassing the 3.3% global average growth over the same period of time. This \ntrend is expected to translate into a yearly average increase of close to 6 million tourists visiting \nASEAN economies. As an outcome, by 2030 ASEAN economies are expected to attract more \nthan 10% of total international tourism (estimated at 1.8 trillion people). Data from the PRC \nsuggest that the total number of tourists from the PRC going abroad has doubled between 2006 \nand 2011, and that those visiting ASEAN economies have tripled, from 2.6 to 8 million over the \nsame\u00a0period. \nUltimately, Asia\u2019s growth can also be seen as a positive balancing factor for ASEAN in the sense \nof improving economic and financial stability through risk diversification. In the past, Western \npartners such as the US and the EU had very large shares of ASEAN economies\u2019 international \ntransactions, as shown in the trade and FDI data, creating in turn economic dependence on \nthem. However, during the last decade or so the combined relative share of Asian economies has \nbeen increasing considerably, thus giving ASEAN member economies an opportunity to diversify \nthe economic risk related to financial and economic crises across regions. The relatively limited \nimpact on ASEAN economies of the 2008/09 global financial crisis can also be attributed to the \nincrease Asian economies\u2019 share in the group\u2019s overall economic transactions.\nKey challenges for the ASEAN economy\nAsia\u2019s economic growth\u2014focused on the PRC and India\u2014is also a major cause of concern \nfor ASEAN. In particular, the loss of centrality in the institutional architecture for regional \ncooperation is a diffused threat among ASEAN economies. Closing intra-ASEAN development \ngaps, being ready to complete the AEC by 2015, and moving on to form a borderless economic \ncommunity by 2030 are other main challenges, as ASEAN needs to strengthen its unity against \nrising competition from within and outside the region.\nAs a matter of fact, the notion of centrality is a strategic concern for policymakers. Every ASEAN \nSummit\u2019s Leaders\u2019 Statement explicitly mentions the importance for the group to \u201cmaintain \ncentrality\u201d since the 12th Summit held in Cebu, the Philippines, in January 2007.9 Even Article \n9  Actually the 13th Summit\u2019s Leaders Statement (held in Singapore) does not explicitly mention the words \u201cmain-\ntaining centrality\u201d, but the theme itself of the Summit was: \u201cOne ASEAN at the Heart of Dynamic Asia\u201d. The Lead-\ners\u2019 Statement at the 18th Summit in Jakarta, Indonesia (May 2011) is the one with the highest frequency of explicit \nreferences to maintaining ASEAN centrality (7 times).", "The ASEAN Economy in the Regional Context: Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Options   |   19\nFigure 9.

The Asian Regional Forum, which gathers 17 \nmembers (including the EU) around ASEAN economies, is a clear example of success in the \ndiplomatic and security area (Wihardja 2011). As far as economic relations are concerned, over \nthe years ASEAN was able to create an articulated system of dialogue partnerships with many \neconomies including Australia, Canada, Japan, India, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, the \nUSA, and economies of the EU. In the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis of 1997/98, it also \ndeveloped a framework of \u201cASEAN-Plus\u201d relationships, starting from the ASEAN+3 group with \nthe PRC, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, and later on the ASEAN+6 group (adding Australia, \nIndia, and New Zealand) at the time the East Asia Summit (EAS) was established in December \n2005 in Kuala Lumpur.10 \nASEAN has also established a strong network of ASEAN+1 free trade and investment agreements \nwith Australia and New Zealand, the PRC, Japan, India, the Republic of Korea.11 In addition, \nvarious transregional, regional, and subregional groups are de-facto centered on ASEAN. Asia-\nPacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) connects, for example, East Asia with the Americas, and \nthe Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) with Europe, while the Forum for East-Asia Latin America \nCooperation (FEALAC), promotes international relations with Latin America. At the subregional \nlevel, ASEAN economies are linked with South Asia through the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-\nSectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) and with Pacific island economies \nsuch as Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste through the Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI). \nFigure 10 shows the importance of ASEAN as a pivotal group for transregional and subregional \ncooperation. By bringing together large and small powers, it serves as a catalyst for different \ninterests in the wider Asian region. Through its ability of following a pragmatic approach to \nproblem-solving,  ASEAN  has  placed  a  pivotal  role  in  Asia\u2019s  architecture  for  cooperation. \nMany analysts see ASEAN centrality as a default way to maintaining peace and stability when \nother major regional powers such as Japan, the PRC, or India have been lacking either political \nlegitimacy or the human and financial resources needed to providing regional public goods and \npromoting economic cooperation (Kesavapany, 2010; Caballero-Anthony 2012, Acharya 2012).\n10  The East Asia Summit (EAS) gathers today the 10 ASEAN economies plus Australia, the PRC, India, Japan, the \nRepublic of Korea, and New Zealand, While the first 16 economies joined the EAS since its establishment in 2005, \nthe Russian Federation and the US. The Russian Federation and the US joined the group at a later stage.\n11  India, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the US have also created bilateral programs in support of economic coop-\neration for ASEAN\u2019s Mekong River economies\u2014Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam\u2014includ-\ning the Mekong-Ganga Cooperation (with India), the Japan-Mekong Cooperation, the Mekong-Republic of Korea \nComprehensive Partnership for Mutual Prosperity, and the Lower Mekong Initiative (with the US). In 1992, ADB \nlaunched the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) program including as areas of operations the Yunnan Province \nand Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of the People\u2019s Republic of China in addition to Cambodia, the Lao \nPDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam.", "The ASEAN Economy in the Regional Context: Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Options   |   21\nHowever, as the PRC and India continue to rise and the process of Asian integration broadens, \nit remains unclear whether ASEAN can maintain its centrality. ASEAN\u2019s key role can be eroded \nnot only by external powers, but also internally due to an institutional setting which have become \nin some aspects obsolete and needs reform. On the one hand, ASEAN\u2019s informal approach has \nthe virtue of enabling members with diverse interests to remain nominally united. On the other \nhand its informality is also a great limitation as it inhibits taking operational decisions and renders \nstrengthening regional cooperation more difficult by giving a de facto veto power to member \neconomies favoring the status quo under consensus-based decision making. The threat of losing \ncentrality provides therefore a strong rationale pushing for institutional reform and innovation.\nOther key challenges for ASEAN economies moving forward, as they aspire to meet 2030 \nchallenges, were identified by the ADBI study as: (i) promoting competitiveness and innovation; \n(ii) supporting equitable growth; (iii) enhancing macroeconomic stability; and (iv) protecting \nthe environment (ADBI, 2014). Improving competitiveness vis-\u00e0-vis the PRC, India, and other \nemerging regional markets, while maintaining stable macroeconomic and financial conditions \nemerge indeed as the two major challenges. At the same time, given the large discrepancy in \ndevelopment outcomes existing across ASEAN economies, pursuing an inclusive, equitable, \nand sustainable development path while ensuring the proper management of existing natural \nresources and the capacity to grow in harmony with the environment and neighboring economies \nare identified as the two other major 2030 challenges. Although their emphasis may differ across \neconomies, existing long-term development strategies of ASEAN governments typically touch \nupon all these challenges. \nThe study also recognizes the importance of four growth-enabling factors: (i) developing \nfinancial  markets;  (ii)  harnessing  human  capital;  (iii)\u00a0 building  seamless  connectivity;  and \n(iv)\u00a0strengthening governance. Ultimately, overcoming the above four challenges and ensuring \nsufficient progress in the enabling factors will allow ASEAN economies receive net benefits from \ntheir increased interdependence with the PRC, India, and other Asian economies, paving the \nway for the formation of a truly borderless economic community in the region by 2030.\n5. Conclusion: Recommendations for ASEAN Economies\nIn order to benefit from the opportunities created by the increased interdependence with the \nPRC, India, and other Asian economies, ASEAN economies need to adopt a two-track strategy \nbased on the introduction of deep structural reforms at national level, together with broad \nand deep initiatives for regional cooperation. As ASEAN policymakers plan the region\u2019s future \ndevelopment they should aim at further liberalizing and restructuring their economies, lowering \ncosts while increasing competitiveness, ultimately avoiding falling in the middle income trap.\nNational policies and structural reforms\nThe experience of economies such as Japan and the Republic of Korea, which were able to see \ntheir per-capita incomes reach their current high levels, suggests the importance to strengthen ", "22   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 145\nFigure 10: Panel A - ASEAN Centrality: Major Groups Focused on ASEAN \nARF=ASEAN Regional Forum; ASEAN=Association of Southeast Asian Nations; ASEAN+3=ASEAN plus the People\u2019s Republic \nof China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea; ASEAN+6=ASEAN+3 plus Australia, India, and New Zealand; EAS=East Asia Summit.\nSource: ADBI 2014.\nFigure 10: Panel B - ASEAN Centrality: Major Transregional Groups \ninvolving ASEAN Economies\nAPEC=Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (21 members); ASEAN=Association of Southeast Asian Nations (10 members); \nASEM=Asia-Europe Meeting (44 members); BIMSTEC=Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic \nCooperation (7 members); CTI=Coral Triangle Initiative (6 members); FEALAC=Forum for East Asia-Latin America Cooperation \n(36 members).\nNote: The list of additional 17 Latin American members of FEALAC includes: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, \nDominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela.\nSource: ADBI 2014.", "The ASEAN Economy in the Regional Context: Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Options   |   23\ninnovation through investment in R&D, to reduce business costs through a policy environment \nthat  encourages  the  development  of  a  dynamic  private  sector,  to  expand  the  reach  of \ninformation and communication technology (ICT), including its infrastructure and institutions, \nand to improve governance, particularly in areas related to regulation and trade (Habito, 2012; \nTran, 2011).\nIncreasing investment in R&D to a level close to 2% of GDP (or more) is the first important step \nin avoiding the middle-income trap. R&D investment can be directed to create new product and \nprocess technologies, but also to expand economies\u2019 absorptive capacity of existing technologies. \nSadly, ASEAN member economies have been spending only very small fractions of their national \nincomes on R&D, and in many cases trends have declined. During the 1996-2010 period only \nMalaysia shows constantly increasing shares of R&D spending as a portion of GDP. As Figure 11 \nindicates, businesses and governments spend well-below 1% of GDP on R&D in middle-income \nASEAN economies. Without the realization that R&D investments are of utmost importance to \npromote innovation and competitiveness, ASEAN economies may not be able to show a marked \nimprovement toward high-income status, and related increases in quality of life. \nBased on the economy-level analysis conducted by the ADBI study, the set of national policies \nand structural reforms needed to reduce costs and improve competitiveness and productivity \nshould be geared to improve the overall business environment, nurture SMEs, and develop \nhuman capital (ADBI, 2014). In particular, improvement in the business environment can \nbe obtained by removing regulatory bottlenecks required to encourage business start-ups, \nstreamlining regulations to reduce the time needed for opening and closing businesses, and \neasing market entry and exit of firms. Facilitating the provision of venture capital and lowering \nthe penalty of failure in bankruptcy law can also help promote innovation and entrepreneurship. \nAs several ASEAN members are still lacking competition laws and policies, institutional progress \nin this area, as well as in curbing monopolies and leveling the playing field, are urgently needed.\nGiven the fact that SMEs represent the backbone of production systems in all ASEAN member \neconomies, policies aiming to increase competitiveness and productivity would include the \npromotion of business incubators for SMEs, strengthening trade and logistic networks, and \nproviding targeted financial support for R&D development of SMEs and for attracting venture \ncapital through enhanced equity markets. Training programs are also needed to develop SMEs \nskills, encourage innovation, and eventually upgrade the positioning of ASEAN SMEs in regional \nproduction and distribution networks.\nIn general, ASEAN economies need to strengthen their education and training systems to \nimprove matching between labor supply and demand, especially of skilled labor, at national and \nregional level. Reforms are needed to improve the overall quality of education and to increase \nthe number and quality of technical and vocational schools, also by promoting a more active \nparticipation of private institutions in this sector. Health care, tourism and engineering are areas \nwhich offer increasing opportunities. R&D activities should become more institutionalized \nin tertiary education, which needs to become more closely linked with the demand for skills \ncoming from the private sector.

A deeper initiative is needed to create \na truly borderless economic community in order to further reduce production costs and take \nadvantage of regional synergies, enabling investors to compete as well as strengthen trade and \ninvestment links with firms based in the PRC, India, and other Asian economies. \nEstablishing a borderless ASEAN economy by 2030 implies a number of coordinated initiatives \nat the regional level, which eventually require national action such as eliminating remaining \nbarriers to the flow of goods, services, capital and labor, enhancing regional connectivity, further \nadvancing standardization and harmonization, promoting free trade and investment agreements, \nand strengthening regional institutions. ", "The ASEAN Economy in the Regional Context: Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Options   |   25\nIn  this  context,  the  2010  Master  Plan  for  ASEAN  Connectivity,  which  covers  physical \ninfrastructure, software and institutions, and people-to-people exchanges, provides an excellent \nexample. The development and maintenance of efficient infrastructure such as airports, ports, \nrailways, and roads, require a set of policies and institutions to facilitate coordination between \nregional agencies as well as national and local governments. Strengthening public-private \npartnership (PPP) is also of utmost importance to develop and modernize infrastructure \nand logistic systems and lower transport costs throughout the region. In particular, initiatives \nare needed to simplify PPP procedures required for infrastructure\u2019s projects approvals and to \npromote ICT development.\nAs far as policies related to improving labor market conditions are concerned, the use of a regional \napproach is complicated by the fact that issues largely differ economy by economy. Brunei \nDarussalam, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand are net importers of (particularly unskilled) labor, \nwhile Indonesia, the Philippines, Myanmar and Viet Nam are large net exporters. Cambodia \nand Lao PDR are net exporters, although to a lesser degree due to their smaller labor force size. \nWhile the AEC aims to introduce free mobility of skilled labor across member economies by \n2015, progress is slow and limited to very few professions as mutual recognition agreements are \nyet to be signed and ratified by member economies, including on educational standards and \nqualifications. Immigration policies also create significant barriers, limiting progress in ASEAN \nproductivity increases to achieve higher levels of economic competitiveness.\nRegional free trade and investment agreements\nWith ASEAN economies being very open, agreements meant to facilitate global and regional \ntrade and FDI are of strategic importance to boost competitiveness and promote GDP growth. By \nmid-2013, ASEAN economies had signed 40 such agreements, while 29 were under negotiations \nand 21 being proposed for further discussion. The majority of such agreements were of bilateral \nnature (i.e. between two economies), with 10 plurilateral agreements under negotiation (mostly \nbetween individual ASEAN economies and the EU or the European Free Trade Association). \nNotably, the signed multilateral agreements include the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) of \n1992, and the five ASEAN+1 FTAs, signed more recently with Australia and New Zealand, the \nPRC, India, Japan, and the Republic of Korea (Table 5).12 \nAs a matter of fact, most of these FTAs materialized after the year 2000, with an increasing \nnumber involving non-Asia economies (Plummer and Chia 2009, ADBI 2014), as shown in \nFigure\u00a012. A main reason behind the exponential growth in ASEAN FTAs experienced during the \nlast decade derives from the stalled multilateral Doha Round of the World Trade Organization \nand the approach to embrace regional cooperation as a second-best, yet feasible solution. A \n12  The first trade agreement among ASEAN member states, the ASEAN Preferential Trade Agreement (APTA) was \nsigned in 1977, following the first ASEAN Summit organized in 1976. But not much progress in trade liberalization \nwas experienced until AFTA came into place and a Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme was \nintroduced in 1993 to ultimately eliminate all intra-ASEAN tariffs. To further eliminate restrictions on trade in ser-\nvices, the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services (AFAS) was adopted in 1995 and to liberalize intra-ASEAN \nFDI and attract additional FDI flows from abroad the ASEAN Investment Agreement (AIA) was signed in 1998.", "26   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 145\nTable 5.

TPP negotiations, which began in 2007 and are perceived to be largely \nUS-drive, are expected to be concluded soon. It currently involves twelve economies, of which \nonly four from ASEAN are members \u2013 Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Singapore, and Viet Nam. \nHopefully more will join in the near future as the benefits of being part of TPP are potentially \nquite large. In fact, TPP is a comprehensive, modern, high-standard agreement covering more \nthan 20 areas with sectors often excluded from FTAs, such as agriculture and the environment. \nIt addresses issues related to technical trade barriers, sanitary and phyto-sanitary measures, \ngovernment procurement, service trade, intellectual property rights, competition policy, and \ninvestment. Other economies participating in TPP negotiations are Australia, Canada, Chile, \nJapan, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, and the US. For now key Asian economies such as the PRC \nand India are not involved in the TPP (Das 2012, Wu and Mealy 2012).\nIn contrast, RCEP is a clearly an ASEAN-based initiative, which many experts believe was \nproposed in response to the possibility of losing centrality, and the threat that TPP could divide \nASEAN member states\u2014between those joining and those remaining out of it. RCEP is designed \nto be more comprehensive, but has less stringent requirements than TPP (i.e. adopting a more \nflexible approach for economies requiring temporary exclusion for sensible sectors and longer \ntime for implementing liberalization schemes), and development-oriented, including provisions ", "The ASEAN Economy in the Regional Context: Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Options   |   27\nFigure 12.

In \nprinciple, however, more economies, either from Asia or outside the region, could join RCEP. Its \nnegotiations started in 2011 and are expected to be concluded by 2015.\nAn intense debate was started on TPP and RCEP which focused on membership\u2019s pros and cons \nand whether the two agreements are complementary or if they compete with each other. While \nproponents of the competitive view focus on the fact that the US is not part of RCEP and the \nPRC and India are excluded from TPP, in reality both agreements are open for new members to \njoin and should be regarded as complementary. In particular, it is easier for developing economies \nwhich are ready for some degree of liberalization to join RCEP, while economies which intend to \nundertake deeper liberalization can aim to be TPP members. Eventually, the two FTAs could \nconverge to form a wide and deep regional agreement, with large income gains for its members. \nAs more ASEAN economies will be ready to join TPP negotiations, benefits for the region (and \nthe world) are expected to increase (Petri, Plummer, and Zhai, 2010). \n13  The RCEP aims to rationalize rules of origin by using a simplified approach to their definition and to focus on \nnon-tariff barriers, streamlining and harmonizing custom procedures, and making them more consistent and pre-\ndictable. It covers trade in goods and services, plus investment, intellectual property rights, investment, a dispute \nsettlement mechanism, as well as economic and technical cooperation.", "28   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 145\nIn addition to TPP and RCEP, ASEAN economies could largely benefit from signing FTAs with \nthe EU. Currently, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam are independently negotiating \nFTAs with the EU (with Singapore close to conclude a deal), while individual negotiations with \nother ASEAN member economies may also start soon.14 An ASEAN-EU FTA is also being \ndiscussed. Although negotiations have remained suspended for some time, such FTA would \nconsolidate and replace individual economy agreements and, if concluded, generate large gains \nfor its members.\nASEAN centrality and institutional reforms\nA successful conclusion of the RCEP will greatly boost ASEAN centrality in the regional \ninstitutional architecture for cooperation, confirming the ability of the association to develop \nmechanisms and processes that deliver a strong sense of ownership from a large number of \nstakeholders around a core group of economies that are not perceived as threats by others \n(Capannelli and Kawai 2014). The expansion of RCEP to include other economies beyond the \nASEAN+6 members may form the core component of an Asia-wide economic community. \nCloser regional and global linkages can also be forged by RCEP and TPP converging into a wide \ncross-regional agreement.\nASEAN members may find merit in adopting a broad approach to regional cooperation with a \nperspective to create an economic community embracing the entire region, from East, South, \nand Central Asia to the Pacific. ASEAN\u2019s ability to deal with pronounced intraregional diversity \ngives the association the potential to continue acting as an honest broker to knit the region \ntogether. The 23rd ASEAN Summit concluded in Brunei Darussalam in October 2013 tasked the \nCoordinating Council to identify a post-2015 strategy for the group, moving beyond the AEC. \nHopefully, such strategy will be focused on creating a truly borderless economic community, \nwhich could eventually constitute the core of an Asia-wide economic community in the future \n(ASEAN 2013).15\nWhile ASEAN\u2019s centrality in the wider regional architecture is compelling, some of the group\u2019s \ngoverning principles have become obsolete and need to be urgently updated to increase \ninstitutional efficiency. When ASEAN was established in 1967 its focus was on regional security. \nReflecting the wide diversity of member states, the group chose a pragmatic approach based \non informal, nonbinding rules and noninterference in economies\u2019 domestic affairs\u2014the ASEAN \nWay. After the first ASEAN summit in 1976 the regional dialogue shifted to economic and social \n14  The negotiations for a Singapore-EU FTA were finalized in December 2012. While discussions on investment pro-\ntection are still on-going, both parties seem to be ready to sign the agreement very soon.\n15  The idea of an Asian economic community as a region-wide overarching institution, gathering all Asia\u2019s subregions, \ncovering areas such as infrastructure, trade and investment, money and finance, and the provision of regional public \ngoods was discussed in a recent ADB study (ADB 2010). The study clarified that given Asia\u2019s pronounced diversity, \nthe region\u2019s institutional architecture is expected to maintain a much greater degree of flexibility than Europe\u2019s, \nwithout the implementation of a grand plan for Asian regionalism. While there is large scope to strengthen existing \nAsian institutions for regionalism given their current \u201clightness\u201d, Asian opinion leaders\u2019 surveys confirmed the lack \nof appetite in the region for centralized, strong institutions \u00e0-la EU.", "The ASEAN Economy in the Regional Context: Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Options   |   29\nissues. Since then, reflecting the rapid growth of Southeast Asian economies, and in line with the \nplan to create the ASEAN Community by 2015, economic and socio-cultural issues have gained \ngreat momentum.\nWhile the ASEAN Way has served the region well so far, efficiency-boosting reforms are needed \nto some of the group\u2019s governing principles. Handling economic and social issues requires \nflexibility, and timely decisions, which the current institutional system is often unable to provide. \nWithout institutional reform ASEAN will be unable to maintain its centrality and to strengthen \nits competitive edge against the rise of the PRC, India, and other emerging regional economies.\nThe need for institutional reform covers several key areas: (i) delegating more power to regional \ninstitutions to manage the new markets generated by the AEC and ensure that member states \ncomply with their commitments; (ii) allowing for a qualified majority in decision making on \noperational issues; (iii) upgrading the principle of equal budget contribution to one of diversified \ncontributions based on the capacity as well as willingness of member states to pay; (iv) greatly \nincreasing human and financial resources devoted to the ASEAN Secretariat (currently supported \nonly by some 70 professional staff, operating on an annual budget of only about US$16 million \nagainst a disproportionate volume of tasks to be accomplished); and (v)\u00a0creating an ASEAN \nAcademy to form a regional civil service on ASEAN affairs.16 \nA coherently integrated, not a fragmented, Asia is needed to realize an \u201cAsian\u201d century. ASEAN \nshould maintain its centrality in the regional architecture for cooperation to allow an Asia-wide \neconomic community to emerge. The association has a very important role to play in ensuring \nthat other major Asian economies such as the PRC, India, and Japan will be able to work \ntogether to create such a community. ASEAN and its AEC can play a core central function in this \nprocess, as no regional member wants other groups to take leadership. Eventually, a more closely \nintegrated and coordinated Asia is of strategic importance to ensure sustained global economic \nintegration, growth, and shared prosperity.\n16  A detailed discussion on these reforms is included in the ASEAN 2030 study (ADBI 2014).", "30   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 145\nReferences\nAcharya, Amitav. 2012.

Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the \nregion\u2019s many successes, it remains home to approximately two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor:               \n1.6 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 733 million struggling on less than $1.25 a \nday. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally \nsustainable growth, and regional integration.\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments \nfor helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, \nguarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org Printed in the Philippines\nPublication Stock No. WPS147014-2"], "metadata": {"Author": "Giovanni Capannelli", "CreationDate": "D:20150109154108+08'00'", "Creator": "Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)", "Keywords": "asean, asean economic community, regional economic integration, development aspirations, post-2015 agenda, economic development, domestic structural reforms, economic restructuring, economic liberalization, asean economy, asean community by 2015, giovanni capannelli", "ModDate": "D:20150112160438+08'00'", "Producer": "Adobe PDF Library 9.9", "Subject": "This paper suggests that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) needs an ambitious plan for economic integration beyond the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), which is going to be launched in 2015.
