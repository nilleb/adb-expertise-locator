The AEC is a milestone promoting ASEAN \neconomic integration and centrality, but it alone is insufficient for the group to retain relevance \nin an increasingly multipolar world.

Introduction \n\nAs the global economy recovered from the 2008/09 financial crisis, analysts converged on the \nnotion that Asia has emerged as the growth engine of the world. A recent study commissioned by \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) projected the possibility that by 2050 Asia\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct  (GDP)  will  exceed  50%  of  the  world\u2019s  total,  making  this  century  an  \u201cAsian\u201d  century \n(Kholi et al. 2011). While a debate on the foundations of the Asian century is still ongoing, the \nregion\u2019s economies continue to perform far better than the world\u2019s average. Within Asia, Japan \nmay have finally exited a deflationary trap and seems to be ready to enter a new era of growth. \nAt the same time, despite huge internal and external challenges, the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) and India continue to perform as two giant poles for economic dynamism in Asia and the \nworld (ADB/ADBI 2014). The Republic of Korea; Taipei,China; and Hong Kong, China are also \non track of sustained development with great improvement in people\u2019s quality of life. \n\nIn  this  context,  the  economies  of  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  are \nshowing strong macroeconomic fundamentals and robust economic growth. As a group, they \nhave a large internal market, with a rapidly expanding middle class. They are also implementing \nan  ambitious  plan  to  create  an  ASEAN  Economic  Community  (AEC)\u2014a  single  market  and \nproduction  base\u2014by  2015.  Although  marked  by  great  diversity  within  and  across  member \neconomies, since its establishment in 1967 the group was able to strengthen its role to maintain \npeace and security in the region, eventually gaining centrality in Asia\u2019s architecture for economic \nand political cooperation. \n\nAs Asia\u2019s economy continues its rapid growth, ASEAN member economies will be facing both \nopportunities and challenges. In particular, the rise of the PRC and (more recently) India has \ngenerated serious concerns among some economists and political scientists who, conscious of \nASEAN\u2019s internal weaknesses, warned against the possible erosion of competitive advantages \nand loss of the region\u2019s central position.\n\nThis paper takes, however, a more positive view. It argues that the rise of the PRC and India creates \npotentially  much  higher  opportunities  for  ASEAN  member  economies  than  the  challenges  it \nposes. Increasing economic interdependence with the PRC and India creates opportunities to \nexpand ASEAN\u2019s markets for goods and services and improve economic and financial stability \nthrough diversification of risk outside traditional economic partners such as the United States \n(US) and the European Union (EU). At the same time, however, the rising weight of the PRC\u2019s \nand India\u2019s economies creates a threat to ASEAN, imposing a shift in comparative advantages \nand causing the possible erosion of the pivotal role ASEAN has been playing in Asia\u2019s architecture \nfor integration. \n\nTo  address  these  challenges,  ASEAN  economies  need  to  introduce  a  two-track  strategy \nincluding domestic reforms to facilitate economic restructuring and liberalization, and initiatives \nto  deepen  and  widen  regional  integration,  leading  to  higher  productivity  and  cost  reductions \nthrough  economies  of  scale  and  network  externalities.  Domestic  policies  need  to  enhance \ncompetitiveness and productivity by leveraging on regional production networks and substantially \n\n\f2   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 145\n\nincreasing investment in human capital and research and development (R&D) to upgrade their \ntechnological capabilities. In turn, such investment will also help ASEAN economies from falling \ninto  the  middle-income  trap,  which  remains  a  major  threat  for  economies  such  as  Thailand, \nMalaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. \n\nIn  order  to  remain  relevant  in  a  region  increasingly  dominated  by  the  PRC  and  India,  and \nwhere  Japan  and  the  Republic  of  Korea  maintain  technological  leadership,  ASEAN  member \neconomiesneed to close their ranks, strengthen regional institutions, and move beyond the AEC \nby  creating  a  truly  borderless  economic  community.  Free  trade  and  investment  agreements \n(FTAs), which have proliferated in the last few years, can also greatly help binding the region \ntogether and promote further improvements in competitiveness and productivity. \n\n2. The ASEAN Economy in the Regional Context\n\nASEAN was established almost 50 years ago mainly for political and security reasons. Economic \nand  social  issues  started  attracting  the  attention  of  its  members  only  after  the  first  leaders\u2019 \nSummit  in  1976.  Today,  ASEAN  constitutes  an  overarching  regional  institution  with  several \nactivities and initiatives in a wide-range of functional areas (ADB 2010). Its member economies \nare working to accomplish the ambitious plan to create an ASEAN Community by the year 2015, \nformed by three pillars: (i) the political-security community, (ii) the socio-cultural community, \nand (iii) the AEC.\n\nToday, the ten ASEAN member economies form a major economic bloc. In 2012, their combined \nGDP was above $2.3 trillion, or 3.2% of the world\u2019s total\u2014a share which doubled from 1990. In \nthe same year, with a total population of 620 million (around 9% of the world\u2019s total), ASEAN\u2019s \naverage per-capita income at market prices was close to $3,800, between that of India ($1,600) \nand  the  PRC  ($6,100),  or  to  about  one-third  the  global  average\u2014up  from  one-fifth  in  1990 \n(Table 1).1 \n\nA relatively large and still young population, with a growing middle class of well over 100 million \npeople, represents one of ASEAN\u2019s major strengths. Its member economies are also strategically \nlocated in the heart of Asia, connected to the PRC and India through maritime and land routes, \nand blessed with abundant natural resources\u2014including oil, gas, hydropower, and minerals\u2014a \nlarge biodiversity, and a substantial agricultural base. \n\n1 \n\n ASEAN\u2019s  total  land  mass  in  2012  was  more  than  4,300  square  kilometers  (about  1.5  times  that  of  India  and \n0.5\u00a0times that of the People\u2019s Republic of China).\n\n\fThe ASEAN Economy in the Regional Context: Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Options   |   3\n\nCambodia\n\nIndonesia\n\nLao PDR\n\nMalaysia\n\nMyanmar\n\nPhilippines\n\nSingapore\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\nASEAN\n\nASEAN+6\n\nCLMV\n\nPRC\n\nIndia\n\nJapan\n\nTable 1.

The differences \nacross and within ASEAN economies are indeed huge. For example, in 2012 Singapore\u2019s per-\ncapita  GDP  (at  market  prices)  was  almost  60  times  that  of  Myanmar,  while  Indonesia  had  a \npopulation more than 611 times bigger than that of Brunei Darussalam\u2014with a land area 340 \ntimes larger. Development gaps within and across ASEAN economies are indeed remarkable, \nparticularly between rural and urban areas, as well as in archipelagic regions such as Luzon and \nMindanao in the Philippines or the Western and Eastern provinces of Indonesia. \n\nDisparities  remain  pronounced  in  governance  systems  and  in  the  capacity  to  effectively \nimplement the rule of law. Indicators of economic and social development, such as the human \ndevelopment index, the infrastructure efficiency index, and the ease of doing business index, \nall show pronounced diversity in individual economies\u2019 performance (Table 2), with important \nimplications in meeting the targets to form the AEC by 2015. Needless to say, the challenges \nto create a \u201csingle market and production base\u201d expand with greater regional diversity, which \nmakes  it  difficult  for  member  economies  to  proceed  along  similar  tracks  of  liberalization  and \nintegration, using similar timeframes.\n\nFour  ASEAN  member  economies  (Indonesia,  Malaysia,  the  Philippines,  and  Thailand)  have \nachieved middle income status a few years ago, positioning themselves along a wide range of \nper-capita GDP levels from $2,500 in the Philippines to more than $10,000 in Malaysia. Viet \nNam  has  recently  entered  the  lower  middle  income  status,  with  a  per-capita  income  above \n$1,500, while Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR), and Myanmar remain \nlow income economies, with major pockets of poverty\u2014although in these economies economic \ngrowth has been accelerating with a fast improvement in living standards. \n\nAll  ASEAN  economies  have  rapidly  internationalized  during  the  past  decades.  Viet  Nam  has \nshown,  in  particular,  a  dramatic  increase  in  its  degree  of  trade  openness  (total  exports  plus \nimports over GDP), from 24% in 1985 to 160% in 2012. During the same period, trade has risen \nfrom 42% to 47% of GDP in the PRC, while in India it has more than doubled from 17% of GDP to \n40%\u2014both very large shares given the large size of these two economies2 (Figure 1).\n\nStrengthening regional trade and investment\n\nContinuous progress in trade and investment liberalization and the creation of regional production \nnetworks  are  two  main  factors  driving  the  trend  toward  ASEAN  economies\u2019  increased  global \nand regional interdependence. Within East Asia, the PRC has been expanding its role as a major \nassembly site for manufactures, which has contributed to a continue rise in its share of global \ntrade from 2% in 1990 to 11.5% in 2012. As the corresponding share for ASEAN has stagnated \n\n2 \n\nIn 2012 the trade openness ratio was 107% for ASEAN as a whole, against 51% for the world.\n\n\fThe ASEAN Economy in the Regional Context: Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Options   |   5\n\nTable 2.

A rapidly increased competition from the PRC in export \nmarkets,  combined  with  PRC\u2019s  expanding  internal  market,  could  further  deflect  FDI  toward \nthe  PRC,  accelerating  the  trend  in  place  since  the  mid-1990s.  Removing  existing  barriers  to \nintraregional  trade  and  investment  is  therefore  a  vital  step  for  ASEAN  to  reduce  production \ncosts,  enabling  investors  to  compete  with  companies  based  in  the  PRC,  and  strengthening \nregional production networks.\n\n\f6   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 145\n\nFigure 1.

While the relative importance of traditional markets such as the US and the \nEU has been declining, the share of exports and imports with Asia has basically increased from \n50% to 60% of the total between 1991 and 2011. In particular, intra-ASEAN trade has largely \nrisen to reach about one fourth of total trade, while the relative share of Japan on both exports \nand  imports  has  considerably  declined  by  8-10  percentage  points  over  this  period  to  about \none-tenth of the total. At the same time, however, trade with the PRC\u2014but also India and the \nRepublic of Korea\u2014has increased considerably (Figure 3).\n\nThe importance for ASEAN economies of regional production networks, especially in industries \nsuch  as  electronics,  automotive,  and  machinery,  can  be  captured  by  the  rise  in  intermediate \ngoods\u2019 trade, which has been the glue for binding East Asia together, and linking it to international \nmarkets  (Athukorala  2010).

The  ASEAN \nSecretariat has been working for several years to construct a reliable database on the origin of \nincoming FDI flows in the ten ASEAN economies. Based on this source, during the period 1995-\n2012 the cumulated FDI inflows to ASEAN amounted to a total USD 879 billion\u2014about 75% \nof which were received during the 2003-2012 period alone, as production networks expanded \nconsiderably. Approximately one-fourth of such investment originated from the EU, one-tenth \nfrom  the  US,  and  more  than  one-third  from  Asia.

Indonesia (21% of the total), Thailand, Malaysia, and \nViet\u00a0Nam were, in order, the other most preferred destinations.3 \n\nEvolving macroeconomic policies\n\nFollowing the rapid economic growth experienced by Asian economies over the 15 years after \nthe financial crisis of 1997/98, the center of global economic gravity has been shifting toward \nAsia  (ADB  2008).  This  trend,  accompanied  by  a  rebalancing  of  the  sources  of  growth  from \nexports  toward  the  region\u2019s  internal  demand,  is  likely  to  continue  over  the  coming  decades. \nThis process was hastened by the 2008/09 global financial crisis and the eurozone crisis. While \nadvanced economies have entered a prolonged period of subdued growth, emerging Asia is are \nexpected to continue its expansion, even as the region remains vulnerable to external shocks \nand  economies  continue  facing  the  challenges  of  adopting  more  sustainable  and  inclusive \ndevelopment strategies. \n\n3  The recipient economies\u2019 shares of total FDI to ASEAN is calculated from data available at the United National \nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), which estimates the total FDI stock to ASEAN for the period \n1970-2012 at USD 1.4 trillion.\n\n\f10   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 145\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2008/09 global financial crisis, advanced economies\u2019 central banks used \nunconventional monetary easing policies to spur activity in their economies as they were facing \nlong-term sluggish growth, high unemployment, and debt restructuring. These policies resulted \nin a significant surge in global liquidity, sudden exchange rate re-alignments, and large swings in \nliquidity generating spillover effects on emerging markets exposed to potential volatility. High \nliquidity  and  low  interest  rates  in  advanced  economies  led  to  large  capital  outflows,  leaving \nASEAN economies, as well as other emerging markets, exposed to possible overheating, excessive \ngrowth  of  credit,  greater  exposure  to  bank  loans,  and  weakening  overall  macroeconomic  and \nfinancial stability. \n\nThe capacity to use appropriate macroprudential policy has become therefore a critical element \nin  managing  ASEAN  economies  (Sussangkarn  2003).  Similar  to  the  events  unfolding  after \nthe crisis of  1997/98,  ASEAN  member economies\u2014and India\u2014have largely pursued market-\nbased  exchange  rate  regimes,  whereas  the  yuan  appreciation  against  the  US  dollar  has  been \ntightly managed. With current account surpluses and capital inflows, it is possible that ASEAN \ncurrencies will continue to appreciate vis-\u00e0-vis the dollar as well as the yuan, thus weakening \ntheir  competitiveness  against  other  regional  currencies.  Overall,  sluggish  export  demand \nfrom  advanced  economies  increases  competitive  pressure  from  the  PRC,  India,  and  other \nemerging markets. As they react to changing external conditions, ASEAN economies\u2019 possible \nintervention in currency markets needs to be closely coordinated as it may eventually distort \nprice  competitiveness  and  disrupt  the  underlying  stability  that  is  the  foundation  for  smooth \nfunctioning regional production networks.\n\nThe various levels of macroeconomic vulnerabilities ASEAN economies are exposed to reveal \nother  important  dimensions  of  the  group\u2019s  pronounced  diversity.  Macroeconomic  conditions \nin ASEAN+64\u2014with far better data availability and reliability than in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, \nMyanmar, and Viet Nam (CLMV economies)\u2014are in general quite robust, with current account \nsurpluses  in  all  economies  but  Indonesia,  relatively  strong  external  reserve  positions,  low-to-\nmoderate public debt (with the notable exception of Singapore), and relatively sound banking \nsectors  in  terms  of  capital  adequacy  ratios  and  non-performing  loans.  CLMV  economies, \nhowever, show greater vulnerability than the ASEAN6 due to high external and fiscal deficits, \nwith  moderate-to-low  gross  official  reserves.  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam  have  also \nlimited degrees of freedom in using monetary policy tools, due to the high degree of dollarization \nof their economies. \n\nAt the same time, fiscal sustainability is a potential policy issue for several ASEAN economies \ngiven their high public deficits. A number of ASEAN economies where monetary indicators have \ngrown rapidly are also facing a challenge in managing the risk of asset bubbles, as reflected in \nmonetary growth indicators. Data show Viet Nam, Cambodia, and Lao PDR must pay special \nattention  to  monitor  their  macroeconomic  developments  going  forward,  while  Malaysia,  the \n\n4  ASEAN+6 refers to Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand\u2014the first six \nASEAN member states.

During the same period, the PRC economy is expected to grow at an average 8.6% per year \nand India\u2019s at an average 7.9% per year (Figure 6).\n\n3. ASEAN Toward 2030\n\nA recent Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) study conducted in collaboration with the \nASEAN Secretariat and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) projects the growth of the ASEAN \neconomy to 2030, analyzing individual member economies\u2019 aspirations and challenges moving \nforward  (ADBI  2014).  The  study  also  provides  recommendations  for  policymakers\u2014its  main \nmessage is that ASEAN urgently needs a plan beyond the AEC and that the strategy ought to be \nin the direction of strengthening regional integration and creating a truly borderless economic \ncommunity.  The  study  suggests  that  ASEAN  member  economies  need  not  only  to  further \nliberalize the movement of goods, services, capital and people across their economies as well \nas harmonize and standardize rules and regulations region-wide: they also need to strengthen \nregional institutional bodies, with national agencies delegating more powers to enable them to \n\n\f14   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 145\n\neffectively  implement  regional  cooperation  initiatives,  including  fully  implementing  the  AEC \nBlueprints. \n\nWith  pressing  competition  from  the  PRC  and  India\u2014as  well  as  other  Asian  emerging \neconomies\u2014ASEAN  economies  need  to  close  their  ranks  and  boost  competitiveness  and \nproductivity  by  forming  a  tighter  regional  block  able  to  generate  sizeable  economies  of  scale \nand capture network externalities. They must ensure the ability for firms and individuals to trade \nand travel across ASEAN borders, allowing information to flow through a seamless network of \ncommunications. ASEAN member economies have to more efficiently manage scarce natural \nresources, protect the environment, and ensure food and energy security. Eventually, they also \nneed  to  develop  a  stronger  sense  of  community  among  themselves,  with  ASEAN  acting  as  a \nclosely-knit family of nations. \n\nAspirations moving forward\n\n2030  economic  perspectives  are  provided  by  a  set  of  projections  prepared  by  the  ADB  and \nindividual  economies\u2019  aspirations  obtained  through  stakeholders\u2019  consultations  and  analysis \nconducted by local experts, including economies\u2019 own development strategies. \n\nThe outcome of this exercise indicates that ASEAN economies have reached a major crossroads. \nBy  introducing  deep  structural  reforms  domestically  and  through  more  determined  efforts \nfor  regional  economic  integration,  they  can  enter  the  path  of  a  positive  scenario  (defined  by \naspiration targets) leading to tripling per-capita incomes between 2010 and 2030 and raising \ncitizens\u2019  quality  of  life  to  levels  enjoyed  today  by  average  members  of  the  Organisation  for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD). In the absence, however, of such policies, \nASEAN economies will face a negative scenario with subdued GDP growth to an average 3% per \nannum over the two decades, and several economies falling in the middle-income trap as they \nfail to invest in R&D and education (ADBI 2014). This negative scenario is also defined by the \ninability to manage pressing challenges posed by climate change and increasing natural disasters, \nand to solve mounting political tensions, both within and across economies. The average yearly \nGDP growth rates over 2010-2030\u2014by ASEAN economies and groups\u2014under the positive and \nnegative scenarios, are shown in Figure 7.\n\nThe still uncertain economic recovery in the US and the eurozone, combined with the volatility \nof natural resources\u2019 prices (particularly oil and gas) and the PRC\u2019s declining pace of growth since \n2011, may make it difficult for the ASEAN economy as a whole to reach such its ambitious 2030 \naspiration targets. But ASEAN can count on several factors supporting the region\u2019s sustained \neconomic growth once it becomes a truly borderless community as individual economies\u2019 GDP \ncan expand faster by capturing economies of scale, playing a more significant role as regional \nindustrial  hubs,  and  enhancing  economic  integration  with  the  rest  of  the  world\u2014i.e.  growing \naccording to the positive growth scenario.\n\n\fThe ASEAN Economy in the Regional Context: Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Options   |   15\n\nFigure 7.

If  these  economies  will  introduce  the  right  policies  allowing  them  to  follow  a \ndevelopment path similar to that of Japan in the first decades after the Second World War and \nof  the  Republic  of  Korea  more  recently,  they  may  avoid  the  middle-income  trap  and  join  the \ngroup of economies driving global growth and prosperity. This may in turn inspire Cambodia, the \nLao PDR, and Myanmar entering a similar growth path following the example of other ASEAN \nmember  economies.  In  this  context,  adopting  the  two-track  strategy  suggested  in  the  ADBI \nstudy\u2014domestic  structural  reforms  and  bold  initiatives  for  regional  integration\u2014is  important \nto  strengthen  ASEAN  economies\u2019  competitive  edge  and  leverage  at  the  same  time  on  the \nopportunities created by growth in other Asian economies. \n\nADB\u2019s projections for GDP growth in the current decade and the next suggest that while ASEAN \nmay expand at an average 5.4% during 2010-2030, India\u2019s economy will likely grow at an average \n7.7% every year, and the PRC by 7.0% over the same period. While GDP growth in ASEAN is \nexpected to remain quite stable during these years, both India and the PRC will likely slow down \ntheir average rates in the second decade, with the PRC entering a new growth normal within the \n6% level (Figure 8).6 \n\n6  The level for ASEAN economies is approximately 1 percentage point below the aspiration target shown in Figure\u00a07.\n\n\f16   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 145\n\nFigure 8.

Projections \nfor  the  period  2011-2020  and  2021-2030  are  provided  by  ADB\u2019s  Economics  and \nResearch Department, January 2013.\n\nWhile GDP growth rates are an important measure to assess economic development, improvement \nin citizens\u2019 quality of life should be observed through a broader set of concepts and indicators. \nMalaysia has already developed its own \u201cquality of life\u201d index, including measurements of several \nelements  such  as  income  and  distribution,  health,  education,  transport  and  communication, \nhousing, work-life balance, environment, public safety, social participation, culture and leisure, \nand family life. Several other ASEAN economies are in the process of introducing similar indexes \nin preparing their long-term economic development strategies.7 The ADBI study analyzed four \ndimensions  of  quality  of  life  (income,  health,  education,  and  governance)  to  conclude  that \nentering a positive growth scenario will imply reaching, by 2030, a quality of life similar to that \nenjoyed in 2010 by average OECD economies (ADBI. 2014).\n\n4. Opportunities and Challenges\n\nAsia\u2019s rapid growth and closer economic integration implies opportunities as well as challenges \nfor ASEAN member economies. On balance, the potential benefits outweigh the costs, as the \n\n7  The Human Development Index (HDI), shown in Table 2, is an early attempt to measure some key components of \n\nquality of life, started by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) back in 1980.\n\n\fThe ASEAN Economy in the Regional Context: Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Options   |   17\n\nincome effect and creation of new markets induced by sustained economic expansion remains \nlarge compared with the substitution effect related to the evolving structures of comparative \nadvantages across the region, erosion of ASEAN economies\u2019 international competitiveness, and \nshrinking shares in exports and FDI inflows.\n\nOpportunities arising from regional economic interdependence\n\nASEAN\u2019s strategic location at the center of Asia offers the group the opportunity to serve as \na  natural  land  bridge  between  East  and  South  Asia\u2014especially  between  two  of  the  world\u2019s \nmost  dynamic  markets:  the  PRC  and  India.8  Such  role  has  been  strengthened  since  the \ndramatic changes recently occurred in Myanmar, which led to the economy\u2019s opening up and \nnormalization  through  deep  political  and  economic  reforms,  enhancing  regional  connectivity. \nIn the years running up to 2030, opportunities for ASEAN member economies to further grow \nthrough trade and investment will be enormous as the group creates its single market through \nthe AEC and new regional demand is generated by other Asian economies.\n\nA growing middle class, an aging population, and an increasing percentage of people living in urban \nareas are major trends defining Asia\u2019s future growth (Kholi, et al. 2011). Increased intraregional \neconomic interdependence creates a unique chance for ASEAN economies to exploit the PRC\u2019s \nand India\u2019s huge and rising domestic markets. The rapid expansion of a vast middle class in both \neconomies creates large opportunities for goods and services made in ASEAN, catering local \nconsumption. Recent estimates suggest that, by 2030, more than 1.2 billion people in the PRC \nand  1  billion  people  in  India  (respectively  85%  and  70%  of  the  population)  will  have  reached \nmedium- or high-income levels (ADB/ADBI 2014). \n\nCloser  interdependence  is  also  important  for  ASEAN  member  economies  to  benefit  from \nbuyer-supplier relations in production and distribution networks and technology transfer from \neconomies such as Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Taipei,China, which continue to invest in the \nregion\u2019s productive capacity and maintain leadership in many product and process technologies. \nIndeed, participation in regional supply chains helps create robust and competitive export sectors \nand offer significant opportunities for local SMEs\u2019 internationalization. As a matter of fact, one \nof key tenets to bypass the middle-income trap is to reduce reliance on foreign technologies \nby  building  a  business  climate  that  promotes  investment  in  R&D  and  creates  incentives  for \ninnovation  (Kholi,  et  al.  2001).  Without  progress  in  these  areas,  it  will  be  hard  for  ASEAN  to \nbecome a highly competitive region, also given the generally low educational attainment and the \nrelatively large proportion of unskilled labor in the total workforce. \n\nBeside manufacturing exports, changing patterns of Asian consumers are expected to benefit \nresource and agriculturally rich ASEAN economies. Rapidly rising energy and food demand from \nthe region hold large potential gains. Indeed, ASEAN maintains vast potential to increase the \nproduction  and  export  of  energy  and  food,  allowing  it  to  play  an  increasingly  strategic  role  in \n\n8  Aside from the geographic position, ASEAN economies hold deep historical, cultural, and trade links with the rest \n\nof Asia, which facilitate gains from international relations. \n\n\f18   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 145\n\nresponse to potential crises in their supply. By improving connectivity across the region (including \nhard and soft infrastructure plus institutions), ASEAN economies can also develop regional hubs \nin sectors such as tourism, health, education, logistics services, and financial \u00a0services.\n\nTourism,  in  particular,  is  one  of  the  areas  offering  enormous  potential  for  further  growth.  As \nshown in  Figure  9, the  number  of  tourists entering ASEAN  economies has  increased  by 30% \nfrom 2007 to 2011, with a significant increase in the share of Asian tourists on the total. A recent \nreport of the United Nations\u2019 World Tourism Organizations (United Nations, 2012) suggests that \nbetween 2010 and 2030 ASEAN will experience an average 5.1% yearly increase in international \ntourist arrivals, surpassing the 3.3% global average growth over the same period of time. This \ntrend is expected to translate into a yearly average increase of close to 6 million tourists visiting \nASEAN economies. As an outcome, by 2030 ASEAN economies are expected to attract more \nthan  10%  of  total  international  tourism  (estimated  at  1.8  trillion  people).  Data  from  the  PRC \nsuggest that the total number of tourists from the PRC going abroad has doubled between 2006 \nand 2011, and that those visiting ASEAN economies have tripled, from 2.6 to 8 million over the \nsame\u00a0period. \n\nUltimately, Asia\u2019s growth can also be seen as a positive balancing factor for ASEAN in the sense \nof improving economic and financial stability through risk diversification. In the past, Western \npartners such as the US and the EU had very large shares of ASEAN economies\u2019 international \ntransactions,  as  shown  in  the  trade  and  FDI  data,  creating  in  turn  economic  dependence  on \nthem. However, during the last decade or so the combined relative share of Asian economies has \nbeen increasing considerably, thus giving ASEAN member economies an opportunity to diversify \nthe economic risk related to financial and economic crises across regions. The relatively limited \nimpact on ASEAN economies of the 2008/09 global financial crisis can also be attributed to the \nincrease Asian economies\u2019 share in the group\u2019s overall economic transactions.\n\nKey challenges for the ASEAN economy\n\nAsia\u2019s  economic  growth\u2014focused  on  the  PRC  and  India\u2014is  also  a  major  cause  of  concern \nfor  ASEAN.  In  particular,  the  loss  of  centrality  in  the  institutional  architecture  for  regional \ncooperation is a diffused threat among ASEAN economies. Closing intra-ASEAN development \ngaps, being ready to complete the AEC by 2015, and moving on to form a borderless economic \ncommunity by 2030 are other main challenges, as ASEAN needs to strengthen its unity against \nrising competition from within and outside the region.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the notion of centrality is a strategic concern for policymakers. Every ASEAN \nSummit\u2019s  Leaders\u2019  Statement  explicitly  mentions  the  importance  for  the  group  to  \u201cmaintain \ncentrality\u201d since the 12th Summit held in Cebu, the Philippines, in January 2007.9 Even Article \n\n9  Actually the 13th Summit\u2019s Leaders Statement (held in Singapore) does not explicitly mention the words \u201cmain-\ntaining centrality\u201d, but the theme itself of the Summit was: \u201cOne ASEAN at the Heart of Dynamic Asia\u201d. The Lead-\ners\u2019 Statement at the 18th Summit in Jakarta, Indonesia (May 2011) is the one with the highest frequency of explicit \nreferences to maintaining ASEAN centrality (7 times).\n\n\fThe ASEAN Economy in the Regional Context: Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Options   |   19\n\nFigure 9.

The  Asian  Regional  Forum,  which  gathers  17 \nmembers (including the EU) around ASEAN economies, is a clear example of success in the \ndiplomatic and security area (Wihardja 2011). As far as economic relations are concerned, over \nthe years ASEAN was able to create an articulated system of dialogue partnerships with many \neconomies including Australia, Canada, Japan, India, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, the \nUSA, and economies of the EU. In the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis of 1997/98, it also \ndeveloped a framework of \u201cASEAN-Plus\u201d relationships, starting from the ASEAN+3 group with \nthe PRC, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, and later on the ASEAN+6 group (adding Australia, \nIndia, and New Zealand) at the time the East Asia Summit (EAS) was established in December \n2005 in Kuala Lumpur.10 \n\nASEAN has also established a strong network of ASEAN+1 free trade and investment agreements \nwith  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  the  PRC,  Japan,  India,  the  Republic  of  Korea.11  In  addition, \nvarious transregional, regional, and subregional groups are de-facto centered on ASEAN. Asia-\nPacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) connects, for example, East Asia with the Americas, and \nthe Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) with Europe, while the Forum for East-Asia Latin America \nCooperation (FEALAC), promotes international relations with Latin America. At the subregional \nlevel, ASEAN economies are linked with South Asia through the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-\nSectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) and with Pacific island economies \nsuch as Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste through the Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI). \n\nFigure 10 shows the importance of ASEAN as a pivotal group for transregional and subregional \ncooperation.  By  bringing  together  large  and  small  powers,  it  serves  as  a  catalyst  for  different \ninterests  in  the  wider  Asian  region.  Through  its  ability  of  following  a  pragmatic  approach  to \nproblem-solving,  ASEAN  has  placed  a  pivotal  role  in  Asia\u2019s  architecture  for  cooperation. \nMany analysts see ASEAN centrality as a default way to maintaining peace and stability when \nother major regional powers such as Japan, the PRC, or India have been lacking either political \nlegitimacy or the human and financial resources needed to providing regional public goods and \npromoting economic cooperation (Kesavapany, 2010; Caballero-Anthony 2012, Acharya 2012).\n\n11 \n\n10  The East Asia Summit (EAS) gathers today the 10 ASEAN economies plus Australia, the PRC, India, Japan, the \nRepublic of Korea, and New Zealand, While the first 16 economies joined the EAS since its establishment in 2005, \nthe Russian Federation and the US. The Russian Federation and the US joined the group at a later stage.\nIndia, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the US have also created bilateral programs in support of economic coop-\neration for ASEAN\u2019s Mekong River economies\u2014Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam\u2014includ-\ning the Mekong-Ganga Cooperation (with India), the Japan-Mekong Cooperation, the Mekong-Republic of Korea \nComprehensive Partnership for Mutual Prosperity, and the Lower Mekong Initiative (with the US). In 1992, ADB \nlaunched the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) program including as areas of operations the Yunnan Province \nand Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of the People\u2019s Republic of China in addition to Cambodia, the Lao \nPDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam.\n\n\fThe ASEAN Economy in the Regional Context: Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Options   |   21\n\nHowever, as the PRC and India continue to rise and the process of Asian integration broadens, \nit remains unclear whether ASEAN can maintain its centrality. ASEAN\u2019s key role can be eroded \nnot only by external powers, but also internally due to an institutional setting which have become \nin some aspects obsolete and needs reform. On the one hand, ASEAN\u2019s informal approach has \nthe virtue of enabling members with diverse interests to remain nominally united. On the other \nhand its informality is also a great limitation as it inhibits taking operational decisions and renders \nstrengthening regional cooperation more difficult by giving a de facto veto power to member \neconomies favoring the status quo under consensus-based decision making. The threat of losing \ncentrality provides therefore a strong rationale pushing for institutional reform and innovation.\n\nOther  key  challenges  for  ASEAN  economies  moving  forward,  as  they  aspire  to  meet  2030 \nchallenges, were identified by the ADBI study as: (i) promoting competitiveness and innovation; \n(ii)  supporting  equitable  growth;  (iii)  enhancing  macroeconomic  stability;  and  (iv)  protecting \nthe environment (ADBI, 2014). Improving competitiveness vis-\u00e0-vis the PRC, India, and other \nemerging  regional  markets,  while  maintaining  stable  macroeconomic  and  financial  conditions \nemerge indeed as the two major challenges. At the same time, given the large discrepancy in \ndevelopment  outcomes  existing  across  ASEAN  economies,  pursuing  an  inclusive,  equitable, \nand sustainable development path while ensuring the proper management of existing natural \nresources and the capacity to grow in harmony with the environment and neighboring economies \nare identified as the two other major 2030 challenges. Although their emphasis may differ across \neconomies, existing long-term development strategies of ASEAN governments typically touch \nupon all these challenges. \n\nThe  study  also  recognizes  the  importance  of  four  growth-enabling  factors:  (i)  developing \nfinancial  markets;  (ii)  harnessing  human  capital;  (iii)\u00a0 building  seamless  connectivity;  and \n(iv)\u00a0strengthening governance. Ultimately, overcoming the above four challenges and ensuring \nsufficient progress in the enabling factors will allow ASEAN economies receive net benefits from \ntheir increased interdependence with the PRC, India, and other Asian economies, paving the \nway for the formation of a truly borderless economic community in the region by 2030.\n\n5. Conclusion: Recommendations for ASEAN Economies\n\nIn order to benefit from the opportunities created by the increased interdependence with the \nPRC, India, and other Asian economies, ASEAN economies need to adopt a two-track strategy \nbased  on  the  introduction  of  deep  structural  reforms  at  national  level,  together  with  broad \nand deep initiatives for regional cooperation. As ASEAN policymakers plan the region\u2019s future \ndevelopment they should aim at further liberalizing and restructuring their economies, lowering \ncosts while increasing competitiveness, ultimately avoiding falling in the middle income trap.\n\nNational policies and structural reforms\n\nThe experience of economies such as Japan and the Republic of Korea, which were able to see \ntheir per-capita incomes reach their current high levels, suggests the importance to strengthen \n\n\f22   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 145\n\nFigure 10: Panel A - ASEAN Centrality: Major Groups Focused on ASEAN \n\nARF=ASEAN  Regional  Forum;  ASEAN=Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations;  ASEAN+3=ASEAN  plus  the  People\u2019s  Republic \nof China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea; ASEAN+6=ASEAN+3 plus Australia, India, and New Zealand; EAS=East Asia Summit.\n\nSource: ADBI 2014.\n\nFigure 10: Panel B - ASEAN Centrality: Major Transregional Groups \ninvolving ASEAN Economies\n\nAPEC=Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  (21  members);  ASEAN=Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (10  members); \nASEM=Asia-Europe  Meeting  (44  members);  BIMSTEC=Bay  of  Bengal  Initiative  for  Multi-Sectoral  Technical  and  Economic \nCooperation (7 members); CTI=Coral Triangle Initiative (6 members); FEALAC=Forum for East Asia-Latin America Cooperation \n(36 members).\nNote: The list of additional 17 Latin American members of FEALAC includes: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, \nDominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela.\n\nSource: ADBI 2014.\n\n\fThe ASEAN Economy in the Regional Context: Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Options   |   23\n\ninnovation through investment in R&D, to reduce business costs through a policy environment \nthat  encourages  the  development  of  a  dynamic  private  sector,  to  expand  the  reach  of \ninformation and communication technology (ICT), including its infrastructure and institutions, \nand to improve governance, particularly in areas related to regulation and trade (Habito, 2012; \nTran, 2011).\n\nIncreasing investment in R&D to a level close to 2% of GDP (or more) is the first important step \nin avoiding the middle-income trap. R&D investment can be directed to create new product and \nprocess technologies, but also to expand economies\u2019 absorptive capacity of existing technologies. \nSadly, ASEAN member economies have been spending only very small fractions of their national \nincomes on R&D, and in many cases trends have declined. During the 1996-2010 period only \nMalaysia shows constantly increasing shares of R&D spending as a portion of GDP. As Figure 11 \nindicates, businesses and governments spend well-below 1% of GDP on R&D in middle-income \nASEAN economies. Without the realization that R&D investments are of utmost importance to \npromote innovation and competitiveness, ASEAN economies may not be able to show a marked \nimprovement toward high-income status, and related increases in quality of life. \n\nBased on the economy-level analysis conducted by the ADBI study, the set of national policies \nand structural reforms needed to reduce costs and improve competitiveness and productivity \nshould  be  geared  to  improve  the  overall  business  environment,  nurture  SMEs,  and  develop \nhuman  capital  (ADBI,  2014).  In  particular,  improvement  in  the  business  environment  can \nbe  obtained  by  removing  regulatory  bottlenecks  required  to  encourage  business  start-ups, \nstreamlining  regulations  to  reduce  the  time  needed  for  opening  and  closing  businesses,  and \neasing market entry and exit of firms. Facilitating the provision of venture capital and lowering \nthe penalty of failure in bankruptcy law can also help promote innovation and entrepreneurship. \nAs several ASEAN members are still lacking competition laws and policies, institutional progress \nin this area, as well as in curbing monopolies and leveling the playing field, are urgently needed.\n\nGiven the fact that SMEs represent the backbone of production systems in all ASEAN member \neconomies,  policies  aiming  to  increase  competitiveness  and  productivity  would  include  the \npromotion  of  business  incubators  for  SMEs,  strengthening  trade  and  logistic  networks,  and \nproviding targeted financial support for R&D development of SMEs and for attracting venture \ncapital through enhanced equity markets. Training programs are also needed to develop SMEs \nskills, encourage innovation, and eventually upgrade the positioning of ASEAN SMEs in regional \nproduction and distribution networks.\n\nIn  general,  ASEAN  economies  need  to  strengthen  their  education  and  training  systems  to \nimprove matching between labor supply and demand, especially of skilled labor, at national and \nregional level. Reforms are needed to improve the overall quality of education and to increase \nthe number and quality of technical and vocational schools, also by promoting a more active \nparticipation of private institutions in this sector. Health care, tourism and engineering are areas \nwhich  offer  increasing  opportunities.  R&D  activities  should  become  more  institutionalized \nin  tertiary  education,  which  needs  to  become  more  closely  linked  with  the  demand  for  skills \ncoming from the private sector. Although the labor market situation differs quite substantially \n\n\f24   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 145\n\nFigure 11.

Reforms  aimed  at  improving  social \nsafety nets and financial inclusion are also important to foster human capital in ASEAN.  \n\nRegional infrastructure policies for a borderless economic community\n\nCreating  the  AEC  is  an  important  step  to  form  an  environment  conducive  to  generate \nproductivity and competitiveness increases and to build ASEAN\u2019s distinct brand of integration \n(ERIA 2010). But the AEC will be insufficient to remove all barriers to internal trade. More needs \nto be done to cope with its ASEAN\u2019s future challenges. A deeper initiative is needed to create \na truly borderless economic community in order to further reduce production costs and take \nadvantage of regional synergies, enabling investors to compete as well as strengthen trade and \ninvestment links with firms based in the PRC, India, and other Asian economies. \n\nEstablishing a borderless ASEAN economy by 2030 implies a number of coordinated initiatives \nat  the  regional  level,  which  eventually  require  national  action  such  as  eliminating  remaining \nbarriers to the flow of goods, services, capital and labor, enhancing regional connectivity, further \nadvancing standardization and harmonization, promoting free trade and investment agreements, \nand strengthening regional institutions. \n\n\fThe ASEAN Economy in the Regional Context: Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Options   |   25\n\nIn  this  context,  the  2010  Master  Plan  for  ASEAN  Connectivity,  which  covers  physical \ninfrastructure, software and institutions, and people-to-people exchanges, provides an excellent \nexample. The development and maintenance of efficient infrastructure such as airports, ports, \nrailways, and roads, require a set of policies and institutions to facilitate coordination between \nregional  agencies  as  well  as  national  and  local  governments.  Strengthening  public-private \npartnership  (PPP)  is  also  of  utmost  importance  to  develop  and  modernize  infrastructure \nand  logistic  systems  and  lower  transport  costs  throughout  the  region.  In  particular,  initiatives \nare  needed  to  simplify  PPP  procedures  required  for  infrastructure\u2019s  projects  approvals  and  to \npromote ICT development.\n\nAs far as policies related to improving labor market conditions are concerned, the use of a regional \napproach  is  complicated  by  the  fact  that  issues  largely  differ  economy  by  economy.  Brunei \nDarussalam, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand are net importers of (particularly unskilled) labor, \nwhile  Indonesia,  the  Philippines,  Myanmar  and  Viet  Nam  are  large  net  exporters.  Cambodia \nand Lao PDR are net exporters, although to a lesser degree due to their smaller labor force size. \nWhile  the  AEC  aims  to  introduce  free  mobility  of  skilled  labor  across  member  economies  by \n2015, progress is slow and limited to very few professions as mutual recognition agreements are \nyet  to  be  signed  and  ratified  by  member  economies,  including  on  educational  standards  and \nqualifications. Immigration policies also create significant barriers, limiting progress in ASEAN \nproductivity increases to achieve higher levels of economic competitiveness.\n\nRegional free trade and investment agreements\n\nWith ASEAN economies being very open, agreements meant to facilitate global and regional \ntrade and FDI are of strategic importance to boost competitiveness and promote GDP growth. By \nmid-2013, ASEAN economies had signed 40 such agreements, while 29 were under negotiations \nand 21 being proposed for further discussion. The majority of such agreements were of bilateral \nnature (i.e. between two economies), with 10 plurilateral agreements under negotiation (mostly \nbetween individual ASEAN economies and the EU or the European Free Trade Association). \nNotably,  the  signed  multilateral  agreements  include  the  ASEAN  Free  Trade  Area  (AFTA)  of \n1992, and the five ASEAN+1 FTAs, signed more recently with Australia and New Zealand, the \nPRC, India, Japan, and the Republic of Korea (Table 5).12 \n\nAs  a  matter  of  fact,  most  of  these  FTAs  materialized  after  the  year  2000,  with  an  increasing \nnumber  involving  non-Asia  economies  (Plummer  and  Chia  2009,  ADBI  2014),  as  shown  in \nFigure\u00a012. A main reason behind the exponential growth in ASEAN FTAs experienced during the \nlast decade derives from the stalled multilateral Doha Round of the World Trade Organization \nand  the  approach  to  embrace  regional  cooperation  as  a  second-best,  yet  feasible  solution.  A \n\n12  The first trade agreement among ASEAN member states, the ASEAN Preferential Trade Agreement (APTA) was \nsigned in 1977, following the first ASEAN Summit organized in 1976. But not much progress in trade liberalization \nwas  experienced  until  AFTA  came  into  place  and  a  Common  Effective  Preferential  Tariff  (CEPT)  scheme  was \nintroduced in 1993 to ultimately eliminate all intra-ASEAN tariffs. To further eliminate restrictions on trade in ser-\nvices, the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services (AFAS) was adopted in 1995 and to liberalize intra-ASEAN \nFDI and attract additional FDI flows from abroad the ASEAN Investment Agreement (AIA) was signed in 1998.\n\n\f26   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 145\n\nTable 5.

TPP  negotiations,  which  began  in  2007  and  are  perceived  to  be  largely \nUS-drive, are expected to be concluded soon. It currently involves twelve economies, of which \nonly four from ASEAN are members \u2013 Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Singapore, and Viet Nam. \nHopefully more will join in the near future as the benefits of being part of TPP are potentially \nquite large. In fact, TPP is a comprehensive, modern, high-standard agreement covering more \nthan 20 areas with sectors often excluded from FTAs, such as agriculture and the environment. \nIt  addresses  issues  related  to  technical  trade  barriers,  sanitary  and  phyto-sanitary  measures, \ngovernment  procurement,  service  trade,  intellectual  property  rights,  competition  policy,  and \ninvestment.  Other  economies  participating  in  TPP  negotiations  are  Australia,  Canada,  Chile, \nJapan, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, and the US. For now key Asian economies such as the PRC \nand India are not involved in the TPP (Das 2012, Wu and Mealy 2012).\n\nIn  contrast,  RCEP  is  a  clearly  an  ASEAN-based  initiative,  which  many  experts  believe  was \nproposed in response to the possibility of losing centrality, and the threat that TPP could divide \nASEAN member states\u2014between those joining and those remaining out of it. RCEP is designed \nto be more comprehensive, but has less stringent requirements than TPP (i.e. adopting a more \nflexible approach for economies requiring temporary exclusion for sensible sectors and longer \ntime for implementing liberalization schemes), and development-oriented, including provisions \n\n\fThe ASEAN Economy in the Regional Context: Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Options   |   27\n\nFigure 12.

In \nprinciple, however, more economies, either from Asia or outside the region, could join RCEP. Its \nnegotiations started in 2011 and are expected to be concluded by 2015.\n\nAn intense debate was started on TPP and RCEP which focused on membership\u2019s pros and cons \nand whether the two agreements are complementary or if they compete with each other. While \nproponents of the competitive view focus on the fact that the US is not part of RCEP and the \nPRC and India are excluded from TPP, in reality both agreements are open for new members to \njoin and should be regarded as complementary. In particular, it is easier for developing economies \nwhich are ready for some degree of liberalization to join RCEP, while economies which intend to \nundertake  deeper  liberalization  can  aim  to  be  TPP  members.  Eventually,  the  two  FTAs  could \nconverge to form a wide and deep regional agreement, with large income gains for its members. \nAs more ASEAN economies will be ready to join TPP negotiations, benefits for the region (and \nthe world) are expected to increase (Petri, Plummer, and Zhai, 2010). \n\n13  The  RCEP  aims  to  rationalize  rules  of  origin  by  using  a  simplified  approach  to  their  definition  and  to  focus  on \nnon-tariff barriers, streamlining and harmonizing custom procedures, and making them more consistent and pre-\ndictable. It covers trade in goods and services, plus investment, intellectual property rights, investment, a dispute \nsettlement mechanism, as well as economic and technical cooperation.\n\n\f28   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 145\n\nIn addition to TPP and RCEP, ASEAN economies could largely benefit from signing FTAs with \nthe EU. Currently, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam are independently negotiating \nFTAs with the EU (with Singapore close to conclude a deal), while individual negotiations with \nother  ASEAN  member  economies  may  also  start  soon.14  An  ASEAN-EU  FTA  is  also  being \ndiscussed.  Although  negotiations  have  remained  suspended  for  some  time,  such  FTA  would \nconsolidate and replace individual economy agreements and, if concluded, generate large gains \nfor its members.\n\nASEAN centrality and institutional reforms\n\nA  successful  conclusion  of  the  RCEP  will  greatly  boost  ASEAN  centrality  in  the  regional \ninstitutional architecture for cooperation, confirming the ability of the association to develop \nmechanisms  and  processes  that  deliver  a  strong  sense  of  ownership  from  a  large  number  of \nstakeholders  around  a  core  group  of  economies  that  are  not  perceived  as  threats  by  others \n(Capannelli and Kawai 2014). The expansion of RCEP to include other economies beyond the \nASEAN+6  members  may  form  the  core  component  of  an  Asia-wide  economic  community. \nCloser regional and global linkages can also be forged by RCEP and TPP converging into a wide \ncross-regional agreement.\n\nASEAN members may find merit in adopting a broad approach to regional cooperation with a \nperspective to create an economic community embracing the entire region, from East, South, \nand Central Asia to the Pacific. ASEAN\u2019s ability to deal with pronounced intraregional diversity \ngives  the  association  the  potential  to  continue  acting  as  an  honest  broker  to  knit  the  region \ntogether. The 23rd ASEAN Summit concluded in Brunei Darussalam in October 2013 tasked the \nCoordinating Council to identify a post-2015 strategy for the group, moving beyond the AEC. \nHopefully,  such  strategy  will  be  focused  on  creating  a  truly  borderless  economic  community, \nwhich could eventually constitute the core of an Asia-wide economic community in the future \n(ASEAN 2013).15\n\nWhile ASEAN\u2019s centrality in the wider regional architecture is compelling, some of the group\u2019s \ngoverning  principles  have  become  obsolete  and  need  to  be  urgently  updated  to  increase \ninstitutional efficiency. When ASEAN was established in 1967 its focus was on regional security. \nReflecting the wide diversity of member states, the group chose a pragmatic approach based \non informal, nonbinding rules and noninterference in economies\u2019 domestic affairs\u2014the ASEAN \nWay. After the first ASEAN summit in 1976 the regional dialogue shifted to economic and social \n\n14  The negotiations for a Singapore-EU FTA were finalized in December 2012. While discussions on investment pro-\n\ntection are still on-going, both parties seem to be ready to sign the agreement very soon.\n\n15  The idea of an Asian economic community as a region-wide overarching institution, gathering all Asia\u2019s subregions, \ncovering areas such as infrastructure, trade and investment, money and finance, and the provision of regional public \ngoods was discussed in a recent ADB study (ADB 2010). The study clarified that given Asia\u2019s pronounced diversity, \nthe region\u2019s institutional architecture is expected to maintain a much greater degree of flexibility than Europe\u2019s, \nwithout the implementation of a grand plan for Asian regionalism. While there is large scope to strengthen existing \nAsian institutions for regionalism given their current \u201clightness\u201d, Asian opinion leaders\u2019 surveys confirmed the lack \nof appetite in the region for centralized, strong institutions \u00e0-la EU.\n\n\fThe ASEAN Economy in the Regional Context: Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Options   |   29\n\nissues. Since then, reflecting the rapid growth of Southeast Asian economies, and in line with the \nplan to create the ASEAN Community by 2015, economic and socio-cultural issues have gained \ngreat momentum.\n\nWhile the ASEAN Way has served the region well so far, efficiency-boosting reforms are needed \nto  some  of  the  group\u2019s  governing  principles.  Handling  economic  and  social  issues  requires \nflexibility, and timely decisions, which the current institutional system is often unable to provide. \nWithout institutional reform ASEAN will be unable to maintain its centrality and to strengthen \nits competitive edge against the rise of the PRC, India, and other emerging regional economies.\n\nThe need for institutional reform covers several key areas: (i) delegating more power to regional \ninstitutions to manage the new markets generated by the AEC and ensure that member states \ncomply  with  their  commitments;  (ii)  allowing  for  a  qualified  majority  in  decision  making  on \noperational issues; (iii) upgrading the principle of equal budget contribution to one of diversified \ncontributions based on the capacity as well as willingness of member states to pay; (iv) greatly \nincreasing human and financial resources devoted to the ASEAN Secretariat (currently supported \nonly by some 70 professional staff, operating on an annual budget of only about US$16 million \nagainst  a  disproportionate  volume  of  tasks  to  be  accomplished);  and  (v)\u00a0 creating  an  ASEAN \nAcademy to form a regional civil service on ASEAN affairs.16 \n\nA coherently integrated, not a fragmented, Asia is needed to realize an \u201cAsian\u201d century. ASEAN \nshould maintain its centrality in the regional architecture for cooperation to allow an Asia-wide \neconomic community to emerge. The association has a very important role to play in ensuring \nthat  other  major  Asian  economies  such  as  the  PRC,  India,  and  Japan  will  be  able  to  work \ntogether to create such a community. ASEAN and its AEC can play a core central function in this \nprocess, as no regional member wants other groups to take leadership. Eventually, a more closely \nintegrated and coordinated Asia is of strategic importance to ensure sustained global economic \nintegration, growth, and shared prosperity.\n\n16  A detailed discussion on these reforms is included in the ASEAN 2030 study (ADBI 2014).\n\n\f30   |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 145\n\nReferences\n\nAcharya,  Amitav.  2012.

As ASEAN designs its long-term development agenda with a view to \nstrengthening its role as a hub of Asian dynamism, its members need to adopt an appropriate \npolicy mix including domestic structural reforms and bold actions to deepen regional integration\u2014\ntransforming the AEC into a truly borderless economic community.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the \nregion\u2019s many successes, it remains home to approximately two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor:               \n1.6 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 733 million struggling on less than $1.25 a \nday. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally \nsustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments \nfor helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, \nguarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\nPublication Stock No. WPS147014-2\n\nPrinted in the Philippines\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["ADB Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration\n", "The ASEAN Economy in the Regional Context: \nOpportunities, Challenges, and Policy Options\n", "Giovanni Capannelli\n", "No. 145  |  December 2014\n", "Principal Economist \nRegional Cooperation and Operations Coordination \nDivision (CWRC) \nCentral and West Asia Department \nAsian Development Bank\ngcapannelli@adb.org\n", "ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n"]}
