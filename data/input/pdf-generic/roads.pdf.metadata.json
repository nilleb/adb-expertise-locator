The study was financed through a $600,000 regional\ntechnical assistance grant - RETA 5753: Developing Best Practices for Promoting Private Sector\nInvestment in Infrastructure. This report focuses on the road sector; the other reports cover the\npower, water supply, airport and air traffic control, and port sectors.\nTransport is central to achieving prosperity and the quality of life, to which all countries\naspire. Transport policy has pervasive impacts: on economic performance; on the shape and\nstructure of human settlements through its impact upon physical development and economic\nstructures; on the distribution of income; and on the environment. This report develops best\npractices for promoting private sector investment in the road sector. It defines the objectives of\nprivate sector participation, reviews experiences of private sector participation in Asia and\nelsewhere, examines the degree of success that has been achieved to date, and identifies the\nkey issues that provide the basis for determining best practices. In addition, the report discusses\nADB\u2019s role in facilitating both private sector participation and competition in the road sector. It is\nhoped that the report will help ADB\u2019s developing member countries successfully attract well\nmanaged and cost-effective private investment.\nThe five reports have benefited from the support of and valuable contributions from many\nindividuals, both inside and outside ADB. The reports were prepared by a team of individual\nconsultants: Water Supply - Michael Porter of Tasman Asia Pacific; Power - Elliot Roseman of\nPricewaterhouseCoopers; Ports - John Arnold, an independent ports specialist; Airports and Air\nTraffic Control - Ian Jones of National Economic Research Associates; and Roads - Roger\nAllport of Halcrow Fox. In ADB, Sean O\u2019Sullivan, Senior Public/Private Sector Specialist\nmanaged the technical assistance implementation with the help of Marcelo Minc, Project\nEconomist. ADB staff in the Energy; Transport and Communications; and Water Supply, Urban\nDevelopment and Housing Divisions as well as the Private Sector Group helped in guiding the\ndirection of the study and in reviewing the outputs. In December 1998, a workshop, hosted by\nADB as an integral component of the study, provided a forum for the exchange of ideas and\nexperiences. Participation and contributions of delegates from many developing member\ncountries and representatives from the private sector in the workshop were very much\nappreciated by ADB.\nThe publication of the five reports is especially timely as it coincides with the introduction\nof a new strategy for private sector development by ADB.\nVladimir Bohun\nDirector\nInfrastructure, Energy and Financial\nSectors Department (East)", "ABBREVIATIONS\nADB \u2013 Asian Development Bank\nBOl \u2013 Board of Investments\nBOOT \u2013 build-own-operate-transfer\nBOT \u2013 build-operate-transfer\nCDCP \u2013 Construction and Development Corporation of the Philippines\nCPI \u2013 Consumer Price Index\nCREMA \u2013 Contrato de Recuperaci\u00f3n y Mantenimiento\nCTS \u2013 Comprehensive Transportation Studies\nDBFO \u2013 design-build-finance-operate\nDMC \u2013 developing member country\nDNV \u2013 Direci\u00f3n Nacional de Vialidad\nDOH \u2013 Department of Highways\nDPWH \u2013 Department of Public Works and Highways\nEBRD \u2013 European Bank for Reconstruction and Development\nEIRR \u2013 Economic Internal Rate of Return\nEPU \u2013 Economic Planning Unit\nETA \u2013 Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand\nEU \u2013 European Union\nGDP \u2013 gross domestic product\nGSZ \u2013 Guangzhou-Shuzhen-Zhuhai\nIADB \u2013 nter-American Development Bank\nICC \u2013 nvestment Coordination Committee\nIFC \u2013 International Finance Corporation\nJBIC \u2013 Japan Bank for International Cooperation (formerly Japan I\nInternational Cooperation Agency/Overseas Economic\nCooperation Fund)\nKL \u2013 Kuala Lumpur\nMRT \u2013 Mass Rapid Transit\nMHA \u2013 National Highway Authority\nNESDB \u2013 National Economic and Social Development Board\nNPV \u2013 net present value\nNSE \u2013 North-South Expressway\nPEA \u2013 Public Estates Authority\nPNCC \u2013 Philippine National Construction Corporation\nPNR \u2013 Philippine National Railway\nPRC \u2013 People\u2019s Republic of China\nPSP \u2013 private sector participation\nROT \u2013 rehabilitate-operate-transfer\nRTA \u2013 Road and Traffic Authority\nSEM \u2013 Societes d\u2019conomie Mixte\nSTAR \u2013 Southern Tagalog Arterial Road\nTA \u2013 technical assistance\nTCA \u2013 Transportation Corridor Agency\nUK \u2013 United Kingdom\nUS \u2013 United States\nWHC \u2013 Western Harbour Crossing\nvpd \u2013 vehicles per day", "TABLE OF CONTENTS\nFOREWORD ............................................................................................................................... i\nABBREVIATIONS......................................................................................................................... ii\nLIST OFTABLES..........................................................................................................................v\nLIST OF FIGURES...................................................................................................................... vi\nLIST OF BOXES ......................................................................................................................... vi\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY ..........................................................................................................vii\nA.

Context\nBefore the Asian financial crisis, it was becoming clear that private sector participation\n(PSP) in the roads sector was proving problematic. The crisis has reinforced this, and brought\nabout a withdrawal of investor confidence. There is broad agreement that countries must now\ndevelop a clear strategy, with four pillars:\n\u2022 The environment for PSP must be improved.\n\u2022 Government must determine sector priorities and identify a pipeline of PSP projects.\n\u2022 The full range of PSP modalities must be deployed, not just build-operate-transfer\n(BOT).\n\u2022 The procurement, implementation and operational processes must be improved.\nSince the crisis, much is changing, and ADB is taking a leading role in assisting its\ndeveloping member countries (DMCs). This is greatly welcomed by governments and the private\nsector alike.\nB. BOT Project Experience\nIn Asia, BOT projects have been synonymous with PSP. After more than a decade of\nconcerted effort, however, implementation experience has not matched expectations:\n\u2022 Surprisingly little has been implemented \u2014 just 20 projects are operational in Asia outside\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).1\n\u2022 Those projects implemented have usually required substantial, unexpected\ngovernment support (the crisis is bringing home the impact of contingent guarantees).\nVery few projects are profitable on a stand-alone basis without substantial\ngovernment support.\n\u2022 Projects have had unexpected adverse impacts sometimes contrary to government\npolicy. In particular, they have led to a concentration of government support in and near\nthe capital cities, and along existing major corridors.\n\u2022 Their cumulative impact upon the problems of the roads sector has been small. Most\nBOT projects have been concentrated where traffic is high, and PSP has had little\nimpact on problems elsewhere.\n\u2022 There has been concern that financial objectives have been the sole determinant of\nwhat happens, to the detriment of development and social objectives.\n1 Many more are operational in PRC, which is different for known reasons \u2014 see Appendix 2.", "viii\n\u2022 There has been concern that corruption, nepotism and cronyism have sometimes\nreduced the prospective benefits for road users.\nHowever, much has been learned, and there have been beacons of innovation. This report\nbrings all the international experience together, and recommends best practices.\nC. Towards Best Practices\n1. Need for a Process\nDeveloping a pipeline of PSP projects in the roads sector requires government to determine\na process, which comprises the following activities, at two different levels:\na. Sector Level\n\u2022 Preparing the PSP environment \u2014 legal, regulatory, and contractual.\n\u2022 Identifying PSP projects in the context of a transport strategy and the realistic level of\npublic sector support necessary, both investment and contingent investment.\nb. Project Level\n\u2022 Preparing a business case for each project, to establish the basis for bidding, and\nconfirm this is acceptable to government.\n\u2022 Securing competitive bids and negotiations leading to bid award.\n\u2022 Providing support and enforcing the concession agreement during construction.\n\u2022 Enforcing the concession agreement and regulating effectively during the concession\nperiod.\nThe economic crisis has reinforced on governments the need for increased transparency\nin the PSP process, and increased rigor in project preparation since they are now faced with a\nbetter informed, and more cautious investment community. Governments are likely to need\nassistance until this demanding process is established both at the roads sector level and more\ngenerally in structuring the PSP environment.\n2. The PSP Environment\na. Country Conditions\nNot all countries are suited to PSP, and particularly to major BOT projects. PSP is likely to\nbe favored in countries where there is:\n\u2022 Political leadership and commitment to a PSP policy.\n\u2022 Political stability.", "ix\n\u2022 An existing income level which is not low - and preferably an income distribution which\nis equitable.2\n\u2022 A sound macro-economy, creating increasing output and real income growth.\n\u2022 Low and stable inflation.\n\u2022 A stable exchange rate.\n\u2022 Domestic capital markets capable of providing domestic financing.\n\u2022 A program of concession projects to build private sector confidence. This will also\nallow the government and the private sector to spread the learning-curve costs.\nThe absence of any one of these features may not hinder the prospects for PSP, but a\ncountry lacking points two or three will likely struggle to introduce effective PSP.\nb. Project Characteristics\nSome types of projects are more likely to be implemented and financed than others. Broadly\nspeaking, the implementation and financing challenge increases with the size and complexity of\nthe PSP option (Table 1) and the challenge for government increases similarly.\nFor many countries, the entry route into PSP in roads should be through maintenance and\noperating concessions. This allows the private sector and government to become familiar with\nperformance-based contracting, and offers the prospect of tackling the maintenance and\nrehabilitation problems, common in many countries.\nThe focus of most countries to date has, however, been on BOT expressways. Many of\nthese have not been financially successful. The characteristics favoring private financing of major\nBOT expressways are as follows:\n\u2022 Projects down existing heavily-trafficked/congested corridors, or where there are missing\nlinks in the network, e.g., estuarial crossings or tunnels. This maximizes traffic prospects\non opening, and minimizes land/relocation costs.\n\u2022 Inter-urban, as opposed to urban projects. This keeps the implementation problems\nand cost relatively low, reduces the traffic risk, and is likely to be effective in tackling\ntraffic congestion.\n\u2022 Elevated or preferably at-grade alignments in cities, and at-grade construction for\ninterurban projects. This keeps construction costs low.\n2 This is important because:\n\u2022 As country income increases project benefits and revenues increase proportionately, but costs much less so. The result is\nthat project profitability increases, and the need for government support reduces.\n\u2022 Conversely, low-income countries require substantial government support, yet are unlikely to be able to provide it rationally\nbecause other projects should often have higher public investment priority.\n\u2022 Where income distribution is equitable, car ownership and use increases.", "x\n\u2022 Projects in middle-income developing countries, preferably with an equitable\nincome distribution. Here the willingness-to-pay tolls and the prospects for traffic growth\nexist.\n\u2022 Tariffs close to revenue-maximizing, and with an appropriate tariff escalation formula\nthat allows potential revenues to be captured over time, for the main vehicle classes.\n\u2022 Projects with an existing income stream, e.g., from an existing estuarial\ncrossing/tunnel, or an existing public sector expressway. This is hugely beneficial\nto financing.\n\u2022 A project that has been well prepared \u2014 in technical terms, in securing\nplanning consents and in proving the feasibility of land acquisition \u2014 thereby reducing\nimplementation risks.\n\u2022 A large project, which recognizes the high fixed bidding costs associated with BOT\nprojects.\n3. Preparing the PSP Environment\nPolitical leadership is essential. Institutions may need to be restructured, with the\nobjectives of controlling the PSP process in the public interest, avoiding tendencies for\ncorruption or empire building, and creating a regulatory body, separate from vested sector\ninterests.\nThe core requirements are:\n\u2022 Developing an acceptable PSP legal framework \u2014 the exact nature of which will be\ncountry specific.\n\u2022 Securing competition for the market. Government should identify good projects and\nthen subject those to competitive bidding (rather than the widespread existing practice\nof accepting unsolicited bids). Where unsolicited bids are accepted, they should be\nsubject to realistic competition.\n\u2022 Securing competition in the market. This requires:\n- Legally-binding concession agreements which set out clearly the rights and\nobligations of all parties, and the procedures to be followed in the case of unforeseen\nevents.\n- Establishment of an autonomous and independent regulator which is also\naccountable. This is likely to be in government, but quite separate from vested sector\ninterests.\n- Encouragement of user groups, maybe empowered through an ombudsman function,\nto exert pressure on infrastructure providers.\n\u2022 Granting concessions only after government has determined they are clearly in the\npublic interest, and can be revoked if this is not met.", "xi\nMulti-lateral support for government is likely to be beneficial in implementation. A model that\nhas worked well combines a multi-sector PSP Center with PSP cells in the main line agencies.\nThe main PSP Center has the brief to assist line agencies prepare, market and negotiate projects,\nand is staffed accordingly.\n4. Identifying PSP Projects\nThis is a government function, which must take place in the right institutional setting if the\nresults are to be accepted and implemented.\n3\nPriority projects must be identified in the context of a transport (or roads) strategy,  in a two-\nstage process.\na. Prepare Transport (or Roads) Strategy\nThis is required to:\n\u2022 Be acceptable, which means that all affected stakeholders should be involved in its\npreparation.\n\u2022 Identify the package of policies and priority projects which best promote development\nobjectives, given an assessment of existing problems and available future public funds.\n\u2022 Specifically, highlight those projects/programs which may be implemented under PSP\narrangements, having regard to strategic objectives and the range of PSP options\navailable (see Table 1).\nTable 1: The PSP Options\nRehabilitate-\nMaintain Corredor\nStrategy Objective Maintenance Turnkey Operate- BOT\n& Operate Management\nTransfer (ROT)\nNew source of funds \u00d6 \u00d6 \u00d6 \u00d6\nMajor capacity\nincrease (new road) \u00d6 \u00d6 \u00d6\nImproved\nmaintenance \u00d6 \u00d6 \u00d6 \u00d6\nRehabilitation of \u00d6\nexisting roads\n3\nA transport strategy is normally required for cities, and inter-urban corridors where modal competition can be effective", "xii\nb. Identify Priority PSP Projects\nGovernment must prepare feasibility studies, which will allow it to commit to specific\nprojects. Again, the institutional setting is central to achieving acceptability, and requires the\nparticipation of the key stakeholders.\nThis form of feasibility study requires:\n\u2022 A focus on optimizing the project specification, and delivering a project with robust\ncharacteristics. Specifically, the potential of the project to promote development,\nsocial, and environmental objectives, as well as economic efficiency, should be\naddressed.\n\u2022 Tariff policy should be set in the light of government objectives.\n\u2022 A focus on implementability and financing.\n\u2022 A  scope  including  all  those  activities  which  affect  government\u2019s  decision as to\nwhether to go ahead (technical, economic, financial, institutional, legal, and land).\n5. Preparing the Business Case\nThis is required in order to confirm the decision to let the project, and identify the terms of\nthe bidding in the knowledge of the likely market response; hence contact with potential bidders\nis necessary. This in-depth analysis should:\n\u2022 Establish the project financial structure.\n\u2022 Identify the nature and scale of all the project risks.\n\u2022 Define the balance between government support and provisions (such as defined tariffs)\nto secure specific government objectives.\n\u2022 Allocate risks between government and the concession company. Experience suggests\nthe allocation in Table 2 is likely to be appropriate at a general level.\n\u2022 Define the provisions for unforeseen events and specify the procedures for renegotiation.\n\u2022 Confirm that the proposed allocation of risks and government support are likely to attract\nserious bids.", "xiii\nTable 2: Risk Allocation\nRisk Responsibility of Responsibility of\nGovernment Concession Company\nCompletion\n\u2013  Land acquisition/permissions         \u00d6\n\u2013  Design \u00d6\n\u2013  Construction time/cost \u00d6\nCommercial \u2013 operations and \u00d6\nmaintenance cost\nCommercial \u2013 Traffic Revenue              Joint, government sharing in \u2018super-profits\u2019, and providing\n                 downside guarantees4\nFinancing                (government support)           Agreed with the banks\nDevaluation and Inflation        \u00d6 \u00d6\nDefault and Force Majeure\n\u2013  By Concession Company \u00d6\n\u2013  By Government        \u00d6\nThe Government should not normally be an equity holder in the project company, as the\nparties have different interests. Rather, the concession agreement should foster common views,\nby revenue sharing and provision for project extensions.\n6. Securing Competitive Bids, Negotiation and Award\nThe basis for bidding follows directly from the business case. International marketing to\npotential investors may be necessary to maximize market interest. Success in attracting serious\nbidders requires the existence of an acceptable PSP process, realism in the balance of risks and\nrewards offered, confidence in the Government resulting from its past performance, and good\ntiming, given the external macro-economic environment.\nIt is necessary to establish a clear bidding and negotiating process:\n\u2022 The project requirements need to be specified closely, to ensure that evaluation of bids\nare equitable.\n\u2022 The Government support should be defined, where necessary as a maximum - rather\nthan held back for negotiation. This allows the private sector to prepare realistic bids,\nand helps to avoid failed bids.\n\u2022 The Government should have access to expert advice during the entire process, from\npreparation of bid documentation through to contract signature. The private sector will\nhave such advice and governments need to be equally well prepared.\n4      This is likely to be particularly necessary for projects on green-field sites.", "xiv\n\u2022 There is merit in having simple evaluation criteria - for example, bidding at defined tariffs\nto minimize the level of government investment required since it gives transparent\ndecisions.\n\u2022 Conforming and non-conforming bids should be allowed, in order to foster private sector\ninnovation.\nGovernment should establish whether and to what extent PSP projects achieve value-for-\nmoney, by comparing costs with the best public sector alternative. Government should also seek\nto establish, through before-and-after audits, how expectations are matched by reality - as a basis\nfor continuous improvements to the PSP process.\n7. Supporting Implementation and Operations\nGovernment should be proactive during this period, with the objective of maximizing the\nsuccess of the project. Government will administer the concession contract, and regulate on an\nagreed basis in the public interest. When unforeseen circumstances occur, government must\nfollow the procedures set out in the concession agreement.\nD. Prospects and Role for ADB\n1. Future Prospects\nThe potential for improvement in the roads sector is large. What may be achievable in the\nnext 5-10 years? While every situation is different, something along the following lines will often be\nsought in Asian countries:\n\u2022 Improvement in the PSP environment - legal, institutional and regulatory.\n\u2022 The institutionalization within government of PSP procurement process and skills.\n\u2022 Development, within government, of an effective transport strategy and project\nidentification process.\n\u2022 Improved preparation of BOT projects, to meet the more demanding requirements of\ninvestors.\n\u2022 A widespread understanding, through education and application, of the different PSP\noptions which can be effective in the sector.\n\u2022 A progressive transfer of maintenance activity under performance-based management\ncontracts with the private sector.\n\u2022 Looking further ahead, the direction is towards greater commercialization of the roads\nsector. It does not seem to be unrealistic to expect the main road system to be packaged\ninto areas or corridors, for management, maintenance and improvement under\nperformance-based contracts. The contracts will be with private sector companies and\nwill have required those companies to develop new skills. This will become a major\nprivate sector industry, focused on both the implementation of new projects, and the\nmanagement of the road system.", "xv\n2. Role for ADB\nThere is widespread recognition by government technocrats and private sector players,\nthat ADB needs to be increasingly involved in this area. The government requires technical assistance\nto restructure and reshape policy, as well as funding and other support. The private sector requires\ntechnical assistance support to secure financing arrangements and to appreciate that ADB assistance\ncan help government to determine sector policy. This offers encouragement for ADB policy that\nalready exists.\nThe five areas for ADB assistance are to:\n\u2022 Prepare the environment and procurement process for PSP.\n\u2022 Broaden the understanding of the range of PSP options that exists in the roads sector.\nMost options are currently not applied, and they provide an undoubted opportunity, as\nexperience elsewhere demonstrates. In particular, they tackle the problems of\nmaintenance and rehabilitation, which underlie the problems of the roads sector in most\ncountries.\n\u2022 Assist with transport strategy formulation. This is necessary for identifying priority PSP\nprojects. It requires coordination with other donors to create the necessary institutional\nsetting for sound strategy development, and its widespread acceptance.\n\u2022 Assist to identify priority projects for joint public-private funding (so-called hybrid projects).\nIt is not yet clear how the different imperatives of ADB and the private sector can best\nbe combined, when faced with an uncertain environment. Experimentation is required\nto establish how this is best achieved.\n\u2022 Invest in projects through ADB\u2019s public and private sector windows, and where\nappropriate, provide guarantees. These activities are widely recognized to leverage\nsubstantial additional funds in projects that ADB has determined are sound\ninvestments.", "xvi", "xvii\nPART ONE\nSTUDY OVERVIEW", "I.           INTRODUCTION\nAn Asian Development Bank (ADB) regional technical assistance was approved with the\naim of developing sector specific best practices for promoting private sector participation (PSP)\nin key infrastructure sectors in ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs). The sectors\nstudied included power, water supply, roads, ports and airports and the best practices covered:\n(i) sector policy issues relating to pricing and competition; (ii) conducive legal and regulatory\nframeworks; (iii) the unbundling, mitigating, and management of risks; and (iv) mechanisms to\nreduce transaction costs. Five individual experts were engaged to undertake the study, one for\neach sector. A two-day regional workshop was held at ADB on 9-10 December 1998 for the\nexperts to present their findings and validate them with an invited group of experienced senior\ngovernment and private sector individuals, together with ADB staff. These volumes represent\nthe final outputs of the study.\nA summary of the expressed views in these volumes in relation to preferred forms of\nPSP in infrastructure, informed by the currency crisis, is that it is \u201cbest practice\u201d to have a customer\nfocus and a well structured regulatory environment around infrastructure projects, in part since\nthis can allow domestic financing. In other words, it is financially and economically sensible to\nutilize the essential and often monopoly status of efficient infrastructure services in creating, in\neffect, a customer finance model of PSP. Under this customer-focused concession or franchise\nmodel, government provides the regulatory and legal framework that can satisfy customer and\ninvestor alike, with the securitization of customer accounts (say via an escrow account) or\ninsurance techniques underpinning financing arrangements. Investors will always seek to mitigate\nuncertainties, but many of the privatization models to date have done so by way of government\nguarantees which have undermined the process in the longer run.\nRegulation by entities appointed by the government is still required in the new model,\ngiven that monopoly provision of key network assets is often the only efficient option. For\nexample there is a need to regulate access charges for connection to network assets such\nas pipelines, high voltage wires and port channels. But where competition can be achieved\nin the product market, as with electricity generation selling into a power pool, then this\ncompetition is generally the best mechanism to achieve good outcomes for customers.\nRealistically, in much of Asia, there is little experience with these new pro-competitive models\nof regulation and thus there is an expectation, on the part of the experts, of a substantial\nphase-in to this regulatory element of best practice in the future.\nThe challenge as we enter 2000 with its information-rich possibilities, is to learn from the\n1990s infrastructure experience on investor-to-government build-operate-transfer (BOT) deals\nand concession transactions so that DMCs can benefit from the adoption of best practices in the\nvarious infrastructure sectors.\nThe following presents an overview of the study, including a discussion on the growth of\nprivate sector infrastructure investment in Asia, a review of the cross-sectoral issues, a\nsummary of the sectoral best practices for each sector and suggestions on the role of ADB\nin supporting private sector investment in infrastructure. Part 2 comprises the specific sectoral\nreport.", "2\nII. THE GROWTH OF PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION\nA. Expansion and Contraction of Private Sector Investment\nThe last decade, and notably the period to 1996, saw both the rapid expansion of private\ninvestment in public infrastructure and a sharp increase in private management of the services\nassociated with this infrastructure. The investment was fuelled by the development of new forms of\nPSP including varying forms of public/private partnerships: BOT, build-own-operate, build-own-\noperate-transfer (BOOT), and concessions.\nNew financial instruments, especially project finance, and the globalization of private\ninvestment funds, played a major role in the expansion of the infrastructure sectors in most countries.\nPSP in infrastructure, and in particular power generation, was supported enthusiastically by the\nmultilateral development banks and bilateral development agencies, as well as by the international\nfinancial community. But fewer transactions were completed in the more complex and customer-\nfocused areas such as water, electricity distribution and transport infrastructure. Early successes\ninvolved financial transactions without major organizational restructuring; later transactions focused\non major infrastructure in mega-cities such as Manila, Jakarta and Shanghai. For example, water\ntreatment plants, bulk water supply, individual power generation units, container terminals, passenger\nterminals, and airport toll roads.\nIn the first half of the 1990s, investment requirements for infrastructure in Asia were\nseen to be on a scale that dwarfed earlier projections and experience. Asian tiger economies\nwere growing rapidly, and demanding massive investments in power, roads, telecommunications\nand other infrastructure. In most Asian economies, there was also a sense that development\nwas being hindered by bottlenecks in power (e.g., the Philippines), transport (e.g., Thailand),\nwater (most of Asia) and telecommunications. Since government infrastructure spending,\ninternational aid, and official sector lending could not be on a scale sufficient to meet requirements,\nthe private sector was the focus of attention.\nThe new infrastructure investment requirements were estimated by ADB to be of the order\nof US$1,000 billion for the 1 990s for East Asia. Subsequently, they were estimated by the World\nBank to be of the order of US$1,500 billion for the decade 1995 to 2004. Such projections were\nuseful as a means of highlighting the scale and structure of the huge infrastructure requirements\nof a growing and increasingly prosperous and urbanized Asia. They helped make clear the need\nfor a major shift of focus towards PSP in infrastructure, to some extent motivated by efficiency\nconsiderations, but mainly reflecting the view that public sector financing for this scale of\ninfrastructure requirements was neither feasible nor desirable.\nThere had also been a shift in views as to the comparative advantages of governments\nand the private sector in performing the various roles related to the provision of quality infrastructure\nservices. Increasingly, an expanded regulatory and restructuring role was seen for governments,\nwith investment, construction, financing, and management viewed as best opened to competitive\nPSP. Risks should, under this approach, be assigned to the parties best able to mitigate them,\nand this meant a greatly expanded role for the private sector.\nThere was recognition that while many private sector investments of the BOT type were\nbeing completed, the assignment of risks in many of these projects left much to be desired.\nGovernment guarantees of bulk take-or-pay contracts (between utilities and investors), often", "3\nindexed to exchange rates, had created huge contingent financial obligations of the utilities and\ntheir governments.\nAs  with  many  investment trends,  optimism,  a  proliferation  of  Memoranda  of  Understanding\nand glossy investment announcements gradually replaced careful evaluation. Some early\nsuccesses, under special circumstances, led to the assumption that this BOT approach could\nbe universally applied. The expression BOT had become a shorthand for PSP in many countries\nby the mid 1 990s; but by 1999 BOTs and often the associated power purchasing agreements\nhad also become a shorthand for unacceptable government risk exposure, and of project isolation\nfrom customer and market pressures.\nThis optimism ended with the Asian financial crisis; itself brought on by a lack of sound\ninvestment policies, in particular, in relation to government guaranteed power purchasing\nagreements. The power purchasing agreements had inadvertently converted a shortage of\npower supply into an oversupply, secured by take-or-pay guarantees. The result of the crisis\nhas been a sharp contraction in private sector investment and a significant exposure of\ngovernment and private sector investors to contingent liabilities. This contraction not only limits\nthe capacity of governments to stimulate economic growth but also has led to the deterioration\nor stagnation of many partially completed and privately financed public infrastructure projects.\nThe rise and fall of private sector finance is clearly shown in the private finance data presented\nin Box 1.\nThe currency crisis has caused some dramatic revisions both to economic growth forecasts\nand to infrastructure investment programs. However, as the analysis in Box 1 shows that while\nforecasts for infrastructure are lower due to lower growth and the expected move to best practice,\nthe magnitude of investment is still huge and efficient PSP will be required.\nB. The Challenge for Private Sector Infrastructure Investment\nAs this difficult period unwinds, it is important to re-consider the comparative advantages of\nthe public and private sectors and the critical role of improved regulation and governance \u2014\nincluding transparency, enforcement of contracts, and the adoption of viable commercial tariff\nstructures. There is a need to review, sector by sector, the strengths and weaknesses of the\nprocess that has been used to implement these investments. The opportunities and risks of new\napproaches need to be addressed \u2013 e.g., the case for expanding the emphasis on customer\nfocused and privately managed concessions. There is a need to develop bankable versions of\nthese models, ideally backed by the security of customer accounts rather than government\nguarantees or public sector assurances. This series of volumes addresses these and other\nsectoral best practice concerns.\nThere are major challenges for governments and investors alike, emerging from this shift\nto a new model for infrastructure development. The new best practice model does not mean a\ntotal retreat by governments; on the contrary, moving to best or better practice involves a shift to\ngood governance, and requires an upgrade of regulatory, restructuring, and monitoring roles.\nWithout greatly improved governance, the shift to increased PSP could just mean monopoly\npowers being shifted to the well connected in the private sector. Moreover, without improved\ngovernance, PSP would eventually flounder and the demands for infrastructure will not be met,\nas risks would become unacceptable.", "Box 1: Past Project Finance and Future Infrastructure Demand \u2014 East Asia\nProject Finance \u2014 Opportunity and Volatility\n      Figure  1  draws  on  a  Euromoney  (Capital DATA)\nFigure 1:\ndatabase  and  highlights  the  dramatic  growth,  and\nProject Finance\nsubsequent decline of infrastructure funded through project\n45\nfinance in selected East Asian countries.

McKinlay (Macquarie\nBank and Tasman Asia Pacific).", "5\nIII. CROSS-SECTORAL ISSUES FOR PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION\nThere are a number of cross-sectoral issues relating to promoting private sector investment\nin infrastructure that were identified during the study. The review of best practices in each of the five\nsectors highlighted the importance of competition, transparent tendering, and effective regulation.\nThere was broad agreement that:\n\u2022 Government  should  specialize  in  planning,  structuring,  and  regulation  while  the\nprivate sector should specialize in management, investment, construction, and\nfinancing;\n\u2022 The transfer of responsibility to the private sector should be accomplished through\nderegulation and open competition or well-established contractual arrangements\nincluding management contracts, capital leases, concessions, sale of assets and\nrights to operate;\n\u2022 Economic regulation should be applied where there is insufficient competition but it\nshould be transparent and predictable while still accommodating the concerns of the\naffected parties;\n\u2022 Long-term domestic financing sources must be developed; and\n\u2022 Commercial risks should be assigned to the private sector but other risks should be\nassigned according to which party is able to mitigate the risks.\nThe cross-sectoral issues are discussed in more detail below.\nA. The Need for Reform and Role of Government\nPSP in infrastructure development still requires the government to play a key role in planning,\npolicy, and regulation. The reason that infrastructure industries have remained so long in the public\nsector is that they have components that are natural monopolies; e.g., the costs are lower with only\none provider and the services are often essential (water, power and transport). These infrastructure\nmonopolies also typically have a relatively high proportion of capital costs, have long-lived assets\nwith low unit variable costs, and exhibit significant economies of scale. It had been a common\njudgement that state ownership of such monopolies, rather than state regulation of privately owned\nassets, was likely to deliver the best outcomes.\nExisting service providers in these infrastructure areas have also had a considerable\ncompetitive advantage over potential new entrants, because of the relatively long time required\nto construct expensive new networks and to build up the market for their services. The scarcity\nof  land,  rights-of-way  and  airspace  suitable  for  development  of  the  network  also  act  as  an\nadditional barrier to competition. Sites for airports and seaports, dams, power plants, and rightsof-\nway  for  roads,  rail  lines  and  transmission  systems  had  become  increasingly  difficult  to\nacquire. Another common argument for retaining these industries within the public sector was\nthat they must provide common (or universal) access to their services and that subsidies are\nrequired.", "6\nIt turns out that public ownership and management is neither necessary, nor the best way\nto ensure universal access. Subsidies can easily be a requirement of a competitive tender or\ncan be directly financed by government. A key advantage of having the private sector provide\npublic services is that it allows public administrators to concentrate on planning, policy and\nregulation. The private sector, in turn, is empowered to do what it does best (i) invest capital; (ii)\nmanage the businesses; (iii) manage and create appropriate incentives for staff and management;\n(iv) deal with customers; and (v) improve the efficiency and quality of service; more recently,\nunder the spur of benchmark competition - competition by comparison.\nGovernments should allow the private sector to provide infrastructure services to the\nmaximum extent possible, with governments concentrating on planning, policy and regulation,\nand with the private sector on efficiently investing capital and improving the efficiency and quality\nof such services.\nB. Institutional Reform\nThe organization of the infrastructure sectors (i.e., ministries, regulatory agencies, and\nutilities) has remained largely unchanged with the introduction of PSP. With financial\ntransactions being the primary mechanism for transferring infrastructure services to the private\nsector, insufficient attention has been given to the broader issue of institutional reforms. It has\nbeen implicitly assumed that the introduction of private management into the ownership or\noperation of specific assets would obviate the need for such reforms. Instead, the weaknesses\nof existing institutional structures have limited the effectiveness of the private sector initiatives. In\nmost countries, the piecemeal transfer of infrastructure components has proceeded slowly and\nthe controlling bureaucracies that add overhead costs and often limit improvements in\ninfrastructure performance, have remained relatively unaffected. The currency crisis has\nemphasized the importance of institutional reforms but government bureaucracies rarely reform\nthemselves. Governments should carefully review the structure, size and responsibilities of state-\nowned utilities and other entities in the infrastructure sectors and establish special reform units\nreporting directly to top level ministers to spearhead the necessary reforms.\nC. Strategic Planning\nGovernments\u2019 acceptance of private sector investment in infrastructure has been due, in\npart, to their failure to anticipate future bottlenecks and make timely strategic investments to\nprevent  shortages  in  capacity.  The  increased  role  of  the  private  sector  in  developing\ninfrastructure has caused many governments to neglect their responsibility for sector planning.\nInstead, governments have offered assets and public services to the private sector in an ad hoc\nmanner, often failing to ensure that individual investments were complementary. In certain\ncircumstances, unsolicited proposals have been used as a surrogate for planning. For its part,\nthe private sector has selected projects that had already been identified in government plans,\ngiving preference to those which offered the highest rate of return, the lowest risk or the greatest\nshort-term benefit. The private sector has had neither the interest nor the capacity to consider\nthe network implications of its proposals. Governments have failed to subject these proposals\nto rigorous financial analysis to determine their sustainability in the absence of major increases\nin user charges or government guarantees. Governments have also often overlooked the\ncomplementary investment required from the public sector to make the private investments\nsuccessful. The results have been unsolicited proposals that involved little commercial risk\n(government guarantees, wrap-around provisions, transfer of existing assets, granting select", "7\nrights of way) or politically generated proposals. Governments should maintain and strengthen\ntheir role in strategic planning of the infrastructure sectors and in the process identify where\nPSP should be encouraged and the level of complementary support that should be provided.\nD. Legal and Regulatory Framework\nThe effectiveness of PSP has suffered from the lack of adequate regulatory structures to\ncontrol both technical and economic performance. Regulation of tariffs and other economic\nfactors is particularly undeveloped. The basic objectives of autonomy, accountability,\ntransparency and predictability have been difficult to achieve. More importantly, the mechanism\nfor consultation between the public and private sector and for dispute resolution between the\nproviders and users of the network has not been fully developed. A further problem has been\nthe failure to separate regulation from administration in order to avoid conflicts of interest. Most\ncountries have been slow to establish autonomous regulatory agencies with independent funding\nand professional staff.\nUnbundling the network into competitive and monopolistic components can significantly\nreduce the need for regulation. The competitive components can be transferred to the private\nsector in a way that promotes competition and allows deregulation. The monopolistic components\ncan then be transferred to the private sector once an effective regulatory framework has been\nestablished. This regulation should create a situation where the businesses derive their profits\nfrom increased efficiency and the attraction of additional demand.\nEffective economic regulation covers also deterrence of anti-competitive practices. Most of\nthe developing countries lack laws or agencies for dealing with anti-competitive practices. Economic\nactivity continues to be concentrated in large conglomerates. The currency crisis has provided\nnew impetus for breaking up the monopolies and introducing anti-monopoly laws.\nThe lack of established legal and regulatory procedures applies to contract law as well. The\nmeans for enforcement of contracts and the resolution of disputes are not well established. Political\ninterference in the award of contracts has also been a problem.\nPSP without a well-developed legal and regulatory framework increases the level of risk to\ninvestors. It also encourages investors to rely on special situations and political relationships rather\nthan their merits as a means for securing and implementing contracts. The transfer of infrastructure\nservices to the private sector should not lead to privileged deals or profits secured by government\nguarantees. They should be businesses with regulated income streams which derive their profits\nfrom increased efficiency and the attraction of additional demand. These income streams should\nbe capable of securing substantial private sector funding, both because their semi-regulated nature\nmakes them much like a government bond, and because the essential and often monopoly nature\nof the service lowers demand risk. Such assets are also long-lived and thus attractive to pension\nand similar long-term funds.\nE. Unbundling and Introducing Competition\nExperience in a number of countries has shown that unbundled infrastructure sectors\nwith individual components managed separately can perform better than centrally-controlled\nnetworks.  The  additional  costs  of  unbundled  networks  due  to  increased  communications  and", "8\ntransactions among components have been reduced by improvements in technology. At the same\ntime, the unbundled management has been able to better focus on the capacity and productivity of\nthe individual components and their interface with other components.\nThe unbundling of the infrastructure sectors is an important technique for reducing their\nnatural monopoly and promoting competition. Many parts of the network can support competition.\nWhere it is not possible to create direct competition between suppliers of network services, it is\noften possible to create competition among providers of complementary network services. For\nexample, in the power sector, many countries are separating the networks into generation,\ntransmission, distribution, and in some cases, a fourth segment responsible for retailing power to\ncustomers, with different companies responsible for each segment.\nWhere competition cannot be created, it is often possible to establish contestable\nenvironments e.g., a market for the business. One method is through effective competitive\nbidding for the sale or lease of assets and licensing or franchising of services. Another is to\nreduce the period of the contractual agreements or to provide for a periodic review of\nperformance. A third is to introduce performance targets related to the quality of the service,\nthe range of services, the prices charged for the services and overall market share. The ability\nof the private sector to achieve these targets is then linked to penalties, or provisions that may\nlead to early termination of the agreement. A fourth method is to require comparable performance\nvis-a-vis other networks. This may be in the form of requirements for increasing market share\nrelative to other providers of similar services, or requiring a quality of service and price that is\ncomparable to other networks serving similar markets.\nMost infrastructure sectors are composed of profitable and unprofitable components.\nOne practical, but not ideal, strategy for transferring the components to the private sector is to\nbundle profitable and unprofitable components to produce a combination that has an acceptable\nlevel of profitability. Another is to tender the profitable components through techniques ranging\nfrom operating agreements and franchising to sales of assets and to transfer the unprofitable\ncomponents using management contracts; in effect, bidding out the government support for that\ncomponent. A third strategy has been to transfer the profitable components to the private sector\nand to retain the unprofitable components in the public sector, but under control of local government\nunits rather than the national government.\nF. Sources of Financing\nPrivate sector funding of infrastructure usually brings the risk of foreign currency\nmismatches in the financing package; income is in local currency, but the need to resort to\nforeign debt and equity markets means that debt service requires substantial foreign currency.\nThe root problem is inadequate depth in capital markets in most DMCs which prevents a tailoring\nof local currency debt to long-lived assets. The need to resort to foreign debt (and equity) creates\nsubstantial risks, which have been exposed in the recent crisis. Few infrastructure consortia can\nwithstand an exchange rate depreciation of 40 to 50 percent, let alone the 80 percent decline\nexperienced in Indonesia when their product is sold for local currency. Hence the priority on\nprograms to deepen the domestic capital market.\nIn principle, currency matching requires that the bulk of debt funding of infrastructure\nservices such as transport, water supply, electricity and other urban services should be in local\ncurrency. In the absence of the necessary capital market reforms, it is hard to see how private", "9\nsector provision of infrastructure can proceed on the scale required to meet future demand. A\npriority, therefore, given the recent experiences, is that international development agencies such\nas ADB expand their role both in facilitating political risk insurance and in fostering the development\nof domestic capital markets in Asia, particularly bond markets.\nDirect foreign investment will remain an important source of funds for the development of\nthe infrastructure sectors. However, it will take time to restore investor confidence and, given the\nexperience of Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines, Republic of Korea and others, governments will\nnaturally seek to limit their exposure to these funds in preference to local sources of capital, if\npossible. The development of domestic long-term capital markets will be critical for private sector\ninvestment in infrastructure, but these markets must have much better regulation as well.\nG. Risk and Risk Mitigation\nIn order to reach financial closure, governments have often accepted commercial risks\nthat should have been assigned to the private sector. This includes not only the foreign exchange\nrisk but also demand/traffic (volume) risk. The most obvious example has been the take-or-\npay provisions in power purchase agreements. These guarantees have had three negative\nimpacts. First, they have isolated the private sponsors from the influences of the market. Second,\nthey have created a large amount of contingent liabilities for governments that now add to their\nfiscal problems. Third, they have encouraged price rigidity leading to distortions in the market\nand reducing the potential of the private sector to improve efficiencies in investment and\noperations. Other examples are build-lease-transfer agreements and volume guarantees for\ntoll roads, airports and seaports.\nBecause governments have had limited contract-related knowledge or experience, the private\nparties have been frequently able to convince them to assume some of the commercial risks. Also,\nbecause governments have often not been able to engage suitable legal, technical and financial\nexperts to assist during negotiations, they have been at a disadvantage in arguing with foreign\nproponents concerning international practices such as take-or-pay contracts, or with international\nlenders concerning guarantees to protect their loans. Bureaucrats who have gone through a long,\noften contentious bidding process have been willing to accept some commercial risks during\nnegotiations rather than to face rebidding. Alternatively, private parties frustrated with drawn out\nnegotiations and the continuing renegotiating of clauses have accepted risks that should have\nbeen borne by the government.\nGovernments should build up capacity to negotiate and deal with the private sector.\nCommercial risks should be assigned to the private sector and other risks should be assigned to\nthe party best able to mitigate them.\nIV.         SUMMARY OF SECTORAL BEST PRACTICES\nThe challenge for governments is to encourage an appropriate form of private sector\ninvestment in infrastructure. The study has identified significant differences among the\ninfrastructure sectors concerning the appropriate balance between private and public\nparticipation in ownership of assets and provision of services. Only some of the sectors have\nwell defined models for PSP. Other best practices are still evolving and the menu will continue\nto develop as experience grows. The decisions on which infrastructure components should be", "10\ntransferred  to  the  private  sector  are  of  a  strategic  nature.  They  depend  not  only  on  the\ncharacteristics of the sector and the market it serves but also on government objectives. There\nwas consensus among the experts that the primary objective should be to benefit consumers.\nHowever there were a number of additional objectives which governments should consider:\n(i) reduction in national debt; (ii) stimulation of domestic capital markets; (iii) reduction in\ncapital and operating subsidies; (iv) investment in new infrastructure or rehabilitation of existing\ninfrastructure; (v) improvements in the quality of service; (vi) increased range of services;\n(vii) reduced prices for services; (viii) client-oriented operations; and (ix) more effective\nmarketing.\nGovernments have at their disposal a number of means for effecting the transfer of\ninfrastructure components to the private sector. The pace and sequence of such a transfer\ndepends on the: (I) size and complexity of the infrastructure sector; (ii) rate of growth in demand\nand the competitiveness of the market; (iii) options for unbundling by function or geography; (iv)\nlegal regime regarding ownership of land and other critical assets; and (v) capacity for economic\nregulation. The established mechanisms, which range from management contracts to unregulated\ncompetition, are not new and have proven effective. The key is to have a vision of where the\nsector is going, and to carry through the reforms as quickly as possible so as not to allow the\ninterim change to become the final state of affairs. The findings of the sectoral experts for each\nsector are summarized below.\nA. Power\nIn the electricity sector, IPPs provided a quick solution (in the Philippines, for example) by\noffering generation capacity needed for rapid economic growth. However, the costs were often\nhigh because the new capacity was not consistent with the least-cost expansion path and the\nprivate sector required high rates of return. However, these costs have been decreasing as the IPP\nmarket has matured. The focus on production rather than efficient distribution put the public sector\nin the position of retaining that activity in which it was least effective and restricting the private\nsector from performing the customer focused activities (distribution and supply) where it had real\nexpertise. At the same time, it isolated the private sector from the market through a combination of\nregulated pricing and guarantees against commercial risks.\nThe power sector expert advocates restructuring to achieve a competitive market model\nwith wholesale and retail competition. Such reform will encourage sustainable PSP and maximize\nthe benefits to consumers. The expert suggests five major steps in implementing this\napproach, and their order of precedence. To some extent, these steps may proceed in parallel,\nbut they should be considered sequential actions that will lead to the implementation of a\ncompetitive power market:\n1. Getting the investment framework right.\n2. Deciding on the goals of restructuring and the ideal industry structure.\n3. Preparing the players to participate in a competitive market.\n4. Privatizing existing and new assets.\n5. Ensuring that the competitive market is implemented properly.", "11\nBest practices for power sector restructuring would include the following:\n\u2022 Create an enabling legal and regulatory environment to support competitive markets in\nelectricity.\n\u2022 Unbundle the power sector into separate generation, transmission, distribution, and\npossibly retailing sectors to achieve the maximum benefits for customers.\n\u2022 Privatization should include the sale of power distribution utilities as well as generation,\nand should include existing assets as well as new projects, using a transparent\nprocess.\n\u2022 Open access to transmission and distribution wires, and the ability to trade power\nbetween buyers and sellers in an open market, are critical to achieve a competitive\nframework.\n\u2022 Operate the generation and retailing markets competitively, with a large number of\ngenerators selling into a wholesale electricity market at prices which balance demand\nand supply throughout the day.\n\u2022 Operate the transmission network as a concession on the basis of competitive\nbidding, or privatize it within a tight regulatory framework, controlling rates of return,\nprices or gross revenue.\n\u2022 The independent regulator should mainly oversee prices and incentives for transmission\nand distribution operations.\n\u2022 Restructuring should proceed at a pace consistent with the development of a\ncompetitive and unbundled system.\nB. Water\nThe water sector has moved more slowly towards private sector investment, relative to\nelectricity  and  telecommunications  for  example,  not  least  because  of  the  jurisdictional,\nenvironmental and sensitive social concerns about water supply, and its affordability. While major\nprivate  sector i nvolvement  has  now  been  achieved  in  distribution  (Manila and Jakarta),  the\nbulk of transactions were BOT models with take-or-pay clauses guaranteed by governments.\nAdding to these difficulties was the lack of knowledge about the location and condition of the\n(underground) networks and aquifers in many countries.\nThe volume on the water supply sector addresses the question of why, given the\nalternatives, the private sector should seek to invest in a sector with so many uncertainties,\nnatural, governmental and financial. Water, unevenly supplied as rainfall, is often wrongly deemed\na free public good, despite the costs of treatment and retail supply. Thus, there is often an ill-\ninformed community constraint against private sector involvement in water supply, which in most\ncountries has prevented the sorts of best practice referred to in this report.\nThe water expert makes the point that when it comes to best practice in the case of\nwater supply, most of the messages are for government \u2014 to install sound and independent\nregulatory regimes, catchment management policies and enforceable laws on tariff setting and\ncollections.  Once  in  place,  best  practices  such  as  water  supply  concessions  can  be", "12\nimplemented. If not in place, then best feasible practice may simply relate to contracting out some\nservices under government guarantee, or BOOT bulk supply to public sector water supply\ncompanies. It follows from this that since the particular features of the water supply situation and\nregulatory and privatization policies differ greatly across countries, so, too, will the feasible best\npractice.\nOne misunderstanding regarding the scope for bringing commercial practices to water\nsupply is the issue of affordability. The report notes that the poor often pay more for water than the\ncost from efficient commercial piped supplies. Experience has shown that low-income families will\npay for quality water supply \u2013 and are not averse to PSP \u2013 it it delivers.\nThe key points recommended were:\n\u2022 The benefits of PSP in the water sector must be explained to win public acceptance.\n\u2022 The starting point in any reform process for water supply is to form a high-level\nreform unit to drive and manage the process. It would be responsible for coordinating\nand facilitating the entire reform and PSP process. The reform unit may be a\ncrosssectoral unit.\n\u2022 While not essential to commence reform, the introduction of tradable water rights leads\nto efficient use of water, particularly when it is scarce and has alternative uses.\n\u2022 The water sector should be unbundled to the extent possible. The private sector\nconcession model is most likely to achieve the greatest benefits to the community and\nthe economy as a whole. The government continues to own the network while the\nprivate operators lease the long-term right to use the assets and collect revenue from\nservice delivery. The benefits accrue due to strong financial incentives to reduce water\nlosses and expand service.\n\u2022 If politically difficult, then the next best strategy is to use BOT, BOOT, and rehabilitate-\noperate-transfer arrangements to bring expertise and finance to urgently required water\nsupply projects. The bidding procedure should be carefully managed to ensure reasonable\ncost and the contractual arrangements should not constrain subsequent progression\nto more competitive models.\n\u2022 Commercialization/corporatization of water supply utilities together with tariff reform is\nadvantageous as an interim step if the introduction of PSP is to be phased.\n\u2022 Tariff reform to achieve full cost recovery is essential for PSP. Cross-subsidies for the\npoor can still be considered in a transparent manner.\n\u2022 Critical to the success of PSP in the water supply sector is for the government to create\nsound and independent regulatory regimes, catchment management policies, and\nenforceable laws on tariff setting and collection.\n\u2022 Risks are likely to vary between countries and even between different water utilities in a\ncountry. They should be managed by the party best able to minimize and manage each\nrisk most effectively. Where no party has a clear comparative advantage to manage the\nrisk, it should be shared.", "13\nC. Roads\nIn Asia\u2019s roads sector, PSP has been equated with major BOT toll roads. These have been\ntargeted where traffic is greatest \u2013 in and near the capital city and sometimes along major inter-city\ncorridors. This private investment has produced some successes but also many failures. After\nmore than a decade of concerted effort, implementation experience has not matched expectations.\nIndeed, surprisingly little has been implemented outside the PRC.\nThe road sector expert has advanced three reasons for modest progress in roads. First,\ngovernments have not defined their policy, often leaving the private sector to identify projects.\nSecondly, almost everyone involved has expected such toll roads to be profitable without government\nsupport, but this has only rarely proved to be the case (outside the dense PRC market, which is\ndeemed a \u2018special case\u2019). Thirdly, it has proved difficult to introduce promised tariffs and tariff\nincreases in a sector where roads have become to be regarded as free.\nWhat is clear is that private construction and maintenance of public roads produced better\nresults where there was adequate competition and effective methods for enforcing contracts. Efforts\nto substitute private sector management for public sector officials in the management of the public\nnetwork are in their early stages, even in the developed economies, but the preliminary results are\nencouraging.\nWorldwide experience identifies a broad range of PSP modalities, in which BOT is close to\nbeing the most difficult to implement. Other modalities include maintenance management contracts,\nturnkey, operate, and maintain or rehabilitate-operate-transfer concessions. Many of these modalities\ntarget improved maintenance, and rehabilitation of the network (rather than solely network capacity\nexpansion). They have potentially much greater application than BOT projects. Looking ahead, the\nrequirements are to both improve the BOT process, and to extend the modalities that are applied.\nThe key points to emerge are:\n\u2022 Governments must prepare the PSP environment. Institutions may need to be\nrestructured with the objectives of controlling the PSP process in the public interest,\nand creating a regulatory body, separate from vested interests. A sound legal framework\nand a predictable regulatory regime are essential.\n\u2022 Governments must identify priority PSP projects. This will almost always require\nan independent feasibility study, which focuses on traffic and tariff policy, project\nstaging, network integration issues, risk allocation, finance and implementation\nissues.\n\u2022 The best prospects for BOT projects are in middle-income countries (where the\nwillingness-to-pay tolls exist) along existing congested corridors, or where there are\nmissing links (e.g., estuarial/river crossings). A regulated income stream from a tolled\npublic toll road is capable of securing project financing of an appropriate kind (i.e., suitable\nto pension funds and other long-term investor groups).\n\u2022 Private sector modalities other than BOT exist, e.g., concessions, and should be\napplied more widely, as they can address many of the sector problems, and in the\nprocess create a new high growth industry for transport management companies.", "14\n\u2022 Traffic risk is the major risk and may be shared. The core risk being taken by the private\nsector, with government taking a share of the upside benefit and providing a downside\nguarantee in the event of low traffic.\n\u2022 Transparency and competition are essential in the procurement process.\n\u2022 Government support should be defined upfront as a maximum so that the private\nsector can prepare realistic bids.\nD. Ports\nIn the port sector, the transfer of cargo-handling activities to the private sector has been,\nin most cases, extremely successful in replacing inefficient government bureaucracy with\ncommercially-oriented management. Improvements in productivity and maintenance has\nincreased the quality of service. However, where there was no competition, these arrangements\nwere less likely to sustain these improvements. Private investment in port infrastructure has\ngenerally been limited to new and existing cargo terminals. Trans-shipment terminals were the\nmost successful, since they were less dependent on local markets and land transport.\nGreenfield ports were slower to develop because they were further from their markets and the\ntransport access was less developed. Basic infrastructure offered few opportunities for full\ncost recovery.\nThe ports sector expert, noted that the private sector has always been actively involved in\nport affairs. The land and water transport services that use the port are almost entirely private\nsector. Nearly all of the cargo shipped through ports is privately owned. The private sector provides\nan array of complementary trade facilitation and logistics services for this cargo. Within the confines\nof the public port, cargo owners, forwarders, and ship agents actively participate in decisions\nconcerning the handling and storage of cargo. The public sector\u2019s role is to own, develop, and\nmanage basic port infrastructure and common-user facilities.\nThe process of port privatization has rarely involved pure privatization, since land and\ninfrastructure are rarely sold. Instead, the process involves PSP in operations and investment in\nequipment and facilities. The process is not a monolithic effort because of the diversity and\ncomplexity of ports and the services they provide. It can be divided into three components: (i)\ninstitutional reform, (ii) divestiture of existing services and assets, and (iii) investment in new\nfacilities and services. These can be implemented individually or in combination. For each port\ncomponent, there are many possible public-private partnerships. The main points regarding moves\nto best practice were:\n\u2022 The bidding process should encourage unbundling not only of the network but also for\nthe services within the ports. Where ports are not financially viable, they should\nnot be bundled with profitable ports, but treated as stand-alone facilities that are\nturned over to local government or put under management contract using a\ncompetitive tender.\n\u2022 The landlord model is the best structure for promoting PSP because it\naccommodates different forms of public-private partnership while recognizing that\nthe only fixed responsibility of the public port is the ownership of the site.", "15\n\u2022 The most effective and efficient procedure for promoting PSP in the port sector is to\nlease existing facilities with relatively short-term agreements that allow for reorganization\nand improvement in productivity. Subsequently, concession agreements can be used\nto encourage private investment in additional capacity. Where this capacity is required\nimmediately, or labor problems make it difficult to lease out existing facilities, then\nconcessions might precede lease agreements.\n\u2022 Continued public investment will be required, as it is difficult to recover the costs for\nbasic infrastructure in a time period reasonable to the private sector. Public investment\nmay also be required to reduce the barriers to entry. This is important where a new\nentrant would otherwise have to make a large investment before competing with existing\nservice providers.\n\u2022 The best form of tariff regulation is market regulation; the second best is through the\nterms of the contract that identify the non-competitive services requiring regulation,\nstate the maximum rates, the formulae for escalating these rates over time, and the\narbitration procedures for discriminatory behavior in excess of that justified by commercial\npricing. The third best is the establishment of a regulatory agency outside of the port\nwhich would apply a pricing formula related to cost recovery. All of these are preferable\nto a vague procedure for negotiating future changes in tariffs.\n\u2022 The private sector should assume all commercial risks. Other risks should be negotiated,\nbased on which party has the capability to mitigate the risk.\n\u2022 The critical element in any effort to promote PSP is competition, or at least the potential\nfor competition. This can be provided through direct competition between private sector\nservice providers, between public and private service providers or between bidders in\nthe case of an activity that does not allow competition.\nE. Airports\nFor the airport sector, PSP in terminal operations produced significant improvements in\nfinancial performance and the quality of service. Private sector investments have increased\nsubstantially over the last five years. During the previous twenty years, there was little capital\ninvestment in airports, despite a five-fold increase in traffic. The airports coped with the higher\nlevels of traffic through a combination of larger aircraft, better air traffic control, improved runway\ndesign, and the addition of second runways and additional terminal space. This period has now\nended and most countries need to invest in new airports. These are proving to be costly, complex\nand often controversial investments.\nThe key policy questions concern how best to structure airports and groups of airports to\nobtain maximum customer benefits. The discussion in the volume on airports and air traffic\ncontrols indicates that there is little evidence of significant scale benefits flowing from multiple\nairport operation; equally, however, there is little evidence of significant scale diseconomies.\nThe case for significantly reducing the concentration of airport ownership at privatization\ntherefore depends on the trade-off between the up-front and visible costs of re-structuring, and\nthe possibly less tangible benefits of increased competition resulting from break-up. The\ncompetition benefits in this industry are not clear-cut, primarily because major airports mainly\nserve distinct regional markets.", "16\nIn the United Kingdom, the authorities took the view that any potential competition gains\nfrom breaking up the British Airport Authority prior to privatization would have been offset by\nrestructuring costs. In Australia, in contrast, the Government has preferred to restructure and reduce\nindustry concentration radically, emphasizing the public policy benefits of inter-airport competition\nfor long haul international traffic. The benefits of fragmented ownership also include those that flow\nfrom yardstick competition, enabling regulatory agencies to assess individual operator performance\nmore effectively; and from introducing a limited element of competition by emulation between\noperators. The airport expert found the benefits from the Australian model to be greater. Key\nrecommendations for the airport sub-sector are as follows:\n\u2022 Airport privatization will be encouraged by the existence of legislation in the form of a\nBOT law or similar, signaling the government\u2019s recognition of the need for PSP in\ninfrastructure provision. It is also important to ensure that the government is able to\ndemonstrate that any projects offered to the private sector are economically viable.\n\u2022 Regarding the optimum approach, full privatization based on asset transfer or acquisition\nthrough long-term leases is preferable to more restricted forms of PSP (but is also\nmore demanding in terms of legal and regulatory frameworks).\n\u2022 As to airport industry restructuring, there is no evidence of significant economies of\nscale in airport operation other than those associated with increased traffic density at a\nparticular location. Hence, PSP can be based on individual airports (although facilities\nmay need to be bundled to assist financing of major new developments or extensions\nto capacity).\n\u2022 The existence of unprofitable airports does not justify the maintenance of a highly\nconcentrated industry structure to facilitate cross-subsidies.\n\u2022 Limited sharing of traffic and revenue risk (between the private sector partner and\ngovernment) is justifiable in airport BOT or concession contracts.\n\u2022 Denomination of some, or all, airport charges in US dollars is an effective way of\nhedging against currency risk and may significantly reduce the risk premium required\nby private investors;\n\u2022 The benefits of PSP in airports are likely to be maximized by regulatory frameworks that\nincorporate good regulatory governance practice. The price-cap approach to constraining\nairport charges is likely to encourage better performance outcomes than one based on\nrate of return regulation.\n\u2022 Competition for the market, whether through sale or leases, or BOT/concessioning,\nwill be maximized by transparent bidding/sale processes.", "17\nV. THE ROLE OF THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\nThe crisis has focused on the urgent need for institutional strengthening and governance\nreforms in both the financial and infrastructure sectors, areas where ADB can play a major role.\nThere are a number of ways identified in the study in which ADB can assist in the reforms\nassociated with increased PSP in infrastructure. The most obvious is to provide technical\nassistance to define policy objectives, develop network master plans, identify and evaluate\nprojects, define the role of new regulatory institutions, and train regulators to handle their new\nresponsibilities, prepare contracts and negotiate with the private sector. ADB\u2019s efforts to\npromote financial sector reform and develop long term capital markets will also be important.\nThis would include efforts to improve the bankruptcy laws, and the regulation of domestic\ndebt and equity markets.\nIn order for ADB to have a significant role in promoting PSP, it should link this promotion\nwith on-going project lending. ADB can provide support for private sector investment directly\nthrough its private sector window and through its guarantee operations. More importantly, ADB\nshould provide sovereign loans to complement but not compete with private sector investment in\nthe form of public-private partnerships. Public sector project lending should also be used to\nfinance basic infrastructure that cannot be packaged into financially viable investments for the\nprivate sector but provides significant economic benefits and improves sector efficiency. Program\nlending is another key modality to promote the necessary reforms where ADB provides financing\nfor the adjustment costs in stages, upon the satisfactory achievement or fulfillment of government\nactions that will promote PSP and sector restructuring. This modality allows ADB to exercise\nsome leverage on government decisions and actions to support reform. Country strategies should\naddress which areas of development are to be financed by government using sovereign loans,\ngeneral revenues and government bonds and which are to be financed by private investment and\nshould ensure a coordinated approach to all forms of ADB assistance.", "17-A", "17-B\nPART TWO\nROADS SECTOR REPORT", "17-C", "18\nI.             OBJECTIVES\nA. Context\n1. Objective of the Report\nThis report develops best practices for promoting private sector investment in the roads\nsector. Originally the subject matter was expressways. Expressways are defined in this report\nas: access-controlled roads capable of providing a high level of service, with a capturable\nrevenue stream. Subsequently, it was decided that the report should incorporate the whole\nroads sector, since much potential exists for private sector participation (PSP) other than\nexpressways. In practice, the report focuses on the main road network, which attracts\nreasonably high traffic flows, and may either be tolled or subject to \u2018shadow tolls\u2019 (by which\npayment is made to the concessionaire on the basis of the traffic \u2014 but without collecting\npayment from motorists directly).\nThe report is set out as follows:\nChapter I \u2013 Defines the objectives of PSP, and the objectives for the roads sector, as a\nbasis for measuring \u2018success\u2019.\nChapter II \u2013 Reviews experience - in Asia and elsewhere, and establishes the degree of\nsuccess that has been achieved to date.\nChapter III \u2013 Identifies the key issues, which provide the basis for defining best practices.\nChapter IV \u2013 Defines best practices, draws conclusions, and identifies the role for the\nAsian Development Bank (ADB).\n2. The Demand for Investment\nThe context for this technical assistance is that the demand for infrastructure investment in\nAsia is much greater than the public sector can finance (given macro-economic lending constraints\nand the willingness of people to pay - and government to collect - taxes). Funding by the private\nsector is therefore necessary.\nThe World Bank (World Bank, 1995) estimated the indicative infrastructure investment\nrequirements for Asia for 1995-2O04.5 The transport sector demand was estimated to be about\nUS$500 billion. The proportion of transport sector funding represented by the roads sector was\nnot  defined,  but  would  represent  the  majority.  Assuming  it  is  60  per  cent,  the  demand  for\ninvestment in the roads sector would be about US$350 billion, or some US$35 billion per year.\nThis sets the scale of the challenge.\n5 This was done as part of major research into the infrastructure sector, which was the theme of the 1994 World Development\nReport. The estimates are based upon World Bank country and sector specific reviews and on a quantitative modeling exercise.", "19\n3. Key Issues Facing PSP in the Roads Sector\nIt is important to start from a viewpoint of realism. Four factors identify the dimensions of\nthis and point to the challenges that must be faced:\n\u2022 For 15 years, Asia\u2019s press has been inundated with articles on build-operate-transfer\n(BOT) projects. But despite the rhetoric, the record of projects completed is \u2014 with a\nfew exceptions \u2014 small. Instead, the experience has often been frustrating for those\nconcerned. There has been few benefits for road users and few profits for participating\ncompanies.\n\u2022 The experience of implemented projects has been mixed - some good, and some not\nso good. The objective should be to secure private sector investment in the public\ninterest. These last four words are crucial \u2014 for private sector investment alone may\nnot be desirable. This report probes how PSP can deliver investment in the public\ninterest.\n\u2022 In Asia, this subject has to date been confined to so-called BOT projects6 \u2014 usually\nvery large new infrastructure projects. This is not the case elsewhere \u2014 notably in Latin\nAmerica, where lower cost approaches have been implemented widely. This report will\nconclude that the potential for PSP in Asia will be realized only when these other PSP\napproaches are applied. This report therefore considers all such options.\n\u2022 The attitudes and motivations of the key players determine what happens in practice,\nand it is important to commence here (see Table 1).\n6\nBOT is used here as the generic name for major projects implemented under private sector concessions.", "20\nTable 1: Motivation/Attitudes of the Key Players\nGovernments7\n\u2022 Politicians  want  the  physical  result:  an  expressway  (and  are  often  little  concerned  with its\ntraffic/benefits).\n\u2022 A \u2018cargo cult\u2019 mentality: BOT projects - a cost-less solution which happen without major government\neffort.\n\u2022 Expressways can be built without acquiring land.\n\u2022 Infrastructure makes money - the easy solution.\n\u2022 All BOT projects are a good thing.\n\u2022 BOT a substitute for transport policy (capacity expansion is the core policy objective).\n\u2022 Once a concession is let, it is up to the private sector to make it a success (no active government\nsupport is necessary).\n\u2022 Reluctance to contemplate tolling existing free roads.\n\u2022 concern to keep tolls affordable to road users.\n\u2022 Reluctance to give up control, and concern to protect government jobs.\nProject Sponsors/Developers\n\u2022 Belief that a combination of purposeful action, good connections, and some technical/financial\nwork can: (i) secure government approval for a new project and (ii) result in effective implementation.\n\u2022 Primary objective for contractor members is short-term construction profits, and an acceptable exit\nstrategy once the project is operational.\n\u2022 Interest in future business prospects in the country (growth in profits come from spreading start-up\ncosts over enlarged networks).\n\u2022 Focus on maximizing revenue capture from tolls.\nFinancial Institutions\nTheir concerns are:\n\u2022 the downside risk - bankers have no upside;\n\u2022 to put a floor under the risk - and get others to take the risk below this.\nTheir requirements are:\n\u2022 strong government commitment to private sector policy;\n\u2022 an adequate legal framework, as a precondition;\n\u2022 adequate procedures for project development (planning consent, environmental, land acquisition\netc) are essential;\n\u2022 sound business plan;\n\u2022 government to have access to world-class consultants, contractors, operators;\n\u2022 forecastable (reliable) project financial risk profile;\n\u2022 acceptable allocation of risks, and where necessary government support;\n\u2022 equity to be fully committed.\nCommunity Groups\n\u2022 Power of the anti-toll and anti-car lobby.\n\u2022 concern that the alignment protects sensitive areas.\n\u2022 concern that environmental and social policies are not circumvented - re: land acquisition!\ncompensation/relocation.\n7\nIn the early stages, many of these views are widely held by domestic financial institutions and project\nsponsors/developers too.", "21\n4. The Sustainability Agenda\nExperience demonstrates the importance of the right transport policy. Transport is central\nto delivering prosperity and the quality of life to which most countries aspire. This is because the\nimpacts of transport policy are pervasive. Policy may impact on economic performance (and\ntherefore incomes); on the shape and structure of human settlements through its impact upon\nphysical development and economic structures; on the distribution of income (and therefore the\nbalance of winners and losers, and on poverty); and on the environment (and hence on the quality\nand enjoyment of life).\nTransport policy can become a catalyst for creating synergy in public policy, delivering\na wide range of benefits, or its failure can create bottlenecks and frustrate the best-prepared\nplans. Transport policy is central to the sustainable development that forward-thinking leaders\nincreasingly recognize as essential. Yet a review of the performance of the sector in ADB\u2019s\ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) shows that all is not well, and that this potential is rarely\nbeing realized.\nIt is concluded that this shortfall in performance is substantially a failure of the traditional\nsystem of government-led planning, implementation, and regulation. This is manifest by\nineffective and under-investment, and by the failure to tackle effectively the scale and diversity\nof problems that face the sector. This is firstly an institutional problem, and secondly a failure of\ntransport policy; yet many believe that the solution lies in more government funding and more\nprojects.\nThe decades ahead pose new challenges for transport policy. Two are fundamental:\n(i) it is increasingly recognized that policy must be sustainable \u2014 planning must be for the\nlong-term, as well as for tomorrow and the day after; and (ii) markets must increasingly set\nthe transport agenda of tomorrow, to meet the diverse and changing needs of consumers and\nproducers \u2014 partly the result of global competition, and because of limitations on future public\nfunding. New challenges need to be met too - the need to develop intermodal transport chains,\ntackle rapidly increasing urban transport problems, address the predicted large increases in\nmotorization, reduce the large and increasing toll of traffic-related deaths and injuries, and address\nthe profound concerns associated with increasing air pollution.\nHow do we \u2018meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future\ngenerations to meet their own needs\u2019?8 The World Bank has published its conclusions after a\nsubstantive  review  of  policy  (World  Bank,  1996).  There  are  three  strands  to  the  answer:\n(i) economic sustainability, this recognizes that economic growth is a valid objective of society;\nwhich must go hand-in-hand with (ii) social sustainability, the problems of poverty and protection\nof the disadvantaged are central to the sustainability agenda; and (iii) environmental\nsustainability \u2014 congestion, pollution, sprawling development and the exhaustion of resources\nall threaten a sustainable future.\n8 This is the definition of sustainability commonly adopted, from Our Common Future (The Bruntland Report), World Commission on\nEnvironment and Development, Oxford University Press, 1987.", "22\nCompetition is the key to promoting efficiency in the sector, and economic sustainability\nrequires the creation of competitive markets (competition in or for the market). This is a central\ntask of government, and it poses critical problems for a government not experienced in the skills of\nlight regulation - of how to regulate in the public interest. When \u2018the prices are right\u2019 scarce resources\nwill increasingly be allocated efficiently, cost recovery will improve, and the sector will become\nincreasingly attractive to the private sector. In short, the imperative of a sustainable transport policy\ngoes hand-in-hand with the funding imperatives for the transport sector.\nThe global change to \u2018A New World\u2019 provides the driving force behind the new transport\nstrategy. Its characteristics are summarized in Table 2.\nTable 2: The Change to \u2018A New World\u2019\nCharacteristic \u2018Old World\u2019 \u2018New World\u2019\nPolicy Objectives Promoting economic Promoting economic growth\ngrowth Reducing poverty\nReducing poverty Protecting the environment\nImproving the status of women\nSupporting human development\nPlanning Timeframe Short/medium term Short/medium and long-term\nDriving Forces Public sector Private sector skills/resouces and public sector\nmanagement/funding policy making, regulation, facilitation restructuring\nprocurement\nForms of Intervention Investment in projects Capacity building/institutional restructuring\nPolicy reform to create competitive markets\nInvestment in projects\nThis future will be very different from the past, and requires a new transport policy agenda.\nThe changes may be expected to take 10-15 years to complete, and once embarked upon are\nlikely to be irreversible.\nCentral to the sustainability agenda is that increasingly, users must pay for the (improved)\nservices they receive - there is no other way to fund the sector. But because of problems in collecting\ntolls, the roads sector is unlike others - charges for use are currently rare.9 There are two options\nfor funding the sector:\n\u2022 The introduction of direct user charges - as with tolled expressways.\n\u2022 Increasing gasoline and diesel prices, such that they incorporate a specific user charge,\nwhich is earmarked for sector investment.\nTechnology will increasingly allow user charges to be brought into line with use, although\nthis will take time before it can be applied to developing countries.\n9\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) is a notable exception. Until the recent reforms, PRC did not have a good intercity road network - inter-\ncity trade and travel was mainly by rail. A new road network is being created and financed through the incremental application of tolls\nto finance construction and maintenance.", "23\n5. Learning from Experience\nThis phase of PSP and investment in infrastructure is relatively new - and only dates back\nto the mid 1980\u2019s; so everyone is on a learning curve. The purpose of this technical assistance is\nto facilitate \u2018jumping up\u2019 the learning curve, by drawing on experiences elsewhere, in the context of\nthe future imperatives of transport policy.\nMuch that we see today is relatively crude, and there is surprisingly little innovation in\nAsian PSP in this sector, while some examples are clearly problematic when measured against\nthe public policy objectives described. This should not be a surprise or a cause for undue\nconcern \u2014 providing purposeful steps are taken to improve the situation, in recognition of the\nscale of the problem, and the urgency required. The Asian economic crisis is providing that\nspur to improvement, and this study is required to define a strategy, and open up the possibilities,\nfor such purposeful steps to be taken.\n6. The Asian Economic Crisis\nHow can investor confidence be regenerated, post-crisis? The starting point is to understand\nthe cause and impact of the crisis. Arguably it is a failure to deliver productive private sector\ninvestments in this (and other) sectors that is a contributory cause of the crisis.\nThe capital cost of a typical BOT project is huge compared with the scale of public funding\nin the sector:\n\u2022 BOT expressway projects typically cost US$0.25 billion - US$1 .0 billion.\n\u2022 The annual public investment in the whole transport sector (roads, rail, ports, airports)\nin developing countries is low - in the Philippines it is just US$1 .2 billion.\n\u2022 This highlights the importance of good BOT projects which massively increase sector\nfunding.\n\u2022 But even a few BOT projects, which do not deliver expected benefits, become a dead\nweight, and can affect the ability of the national economy to grow.\nThe current crisis has huge implications for the future, and should be seen as both a threat\nand an opportunity for future Asian PSP strategy in this sector.\na. The Threat\nIt is paradoxical that there is a huge investment shortfall that the private sector is required to\nmeet; yet the impact of the crisis is very likely to be a reduction in sector funding. Bankers expect\nlittle new risk investment for the next three years. The following responses to the crisis are taking\nplace:\n\u2022 Government transport infrastructure budgets are being cut, due to reduced economic\ngrowth, and increased priorities for social spending in the short-term.\n\u2022 Project costs are increasing in domestic currency terms, as currencies have\ndepreciated.", "24\n\u2022 Traffic and revenues are stagnating, and forecasts are being revised downwards \u2014due\nto expected lower economic growth and incomes.\n\u2022 The prospects for project finances to be supported by property deals, have been\nundermined by weak property markets.\n\u2022 Many private investors have been badly hit by the shock. There is more caution from the\nprivate sector in respect to BOT projects.\n\u2022 Some governments are only now realizing their liabilities under concession contracts.\nCombined with concerns for the macroeconomy, they too are more cautious.\nb. The Opportunities\nIf the right steps are taken, investor confidence will be re-established. The next five-year\nperiod is the time when concerted action is required:\n\u2022 It provides the opportunity for government to create the necessary PSP environment.\nThis is already happening.\n\u2022 Investors are now forcing a much more rigorous appraisal of projects than hitherto.\n\u2022 It is at times of crisis that peoples\u2019 minds open up to new ways of doing things.\n\u2022 The crisis reinforce the need for a change of focus to include lower-cost/higher-impact\nPSP modalities, as well as massive BOT infrastructure projects.\nThe crisis, therefore, provides a window of opportunity for the governments of Asia\u2019s\ndeveloping countries, and for ADB to assist them in the transition towards \u2018The New World\u2019.\nB. PSP and Funding\n1. PSP Objectives\nExperience shows that there are two broad reasons for embarking on PSP:\n\u2022 Because the government\u2019s imperative to do something is not matched by the reality of\nthe public finances - and private funding is the only option (sometimes too it is seen as\nthe easy option, and therefore the obvious course to follow - particularly as most people\nseem to think that infrastructure makes money).\n\u2022 Because PSP is seen as the better way, leading to sector efficiency, and funding its\nnatural consequence - but not necessarily its principal objective.\nToday, most countries fall into the first category. In Europe, the United Kingdom (UK) has\nbroken out of this thinking, and in Asia, Hong Kong, China; has done likewise. Worldwide, the\ndevelopment banks are leading the argument and assisting their DMCs in the transition to the\nsecond category - recognizing that PSP is the better way. In Asia\u2019s developing countries there\nare many individuals who are leading this change in mindset, but there is a long way to go before\nthe true rationale for PSP is understood and believed.", "25\nPart of the reason is that PSP is seen by many in the public sector as a threat, both\ninstitutionally and personally. These attitudes are understandable, and need to be addressed in\nthe context of strong political leadership \u2014 which is increasingly taking place.\nMany are also asking whether the balance between economic objectives and social/\nenvironmental impacts has been addressed? What are the social equity and environmental\nimplications of the PSP policy - and more to the point, should existing policies be changed to\ntarget these concerns?\nWith this introduction, Table 3 defines a framework which allows the success or\notherwise of PSP in the public interest to be assessed, and Table 4 identifies key issues arising\nfrom PSP policies.", "26\nTable 3: Objectives of PSP and Funding\nObjective Comment\n1.

Their involvement in private financing of infrastructure is\ndetailed in Table 5.\nTable 5: Development Bank Involvement in PSP Expressways\nLending to the Private Sector Investment in  Private\nBank Public SectorInvestment\nPublic Sector   Guarantees        Xway projects\nADB Yes Yes (equity & lending via Yes - Partial credit 1 project in Thailand10\nPrivate Sector Group) and co- and partial risk\nfinancing\nWorld Yes Yes (International Finance Yes - against political 2 in Argentina, 1 in each\nBank Corp.

These are strongly supportive, subject to requirements being met concerning:\n\u2022 The importance and priority of the project. This should be compatible with the country\nstrategy and (if this exists) sector strategy.\n\u2022 The preparatidn of the project. The project must be technically sound, must meet\neconomic, social and environmental requirements, and must be institutionally and\nfinancially sustainable.\n\u2022 The procurement of the project. This concerns confirming that the benefits of competition\nare realized, either by providing competition directly, or by checking prices against best\npractice.\n\u2022 Specifically, there is a major concern that PSP does not engender corruption. Bank\npolicies are targeted to counter this.\nAll of the Banks like to appoint (at the expense of the concessionaire) an independent engineer.\nThese requirements are demanding. This is because the decision to implement such projects is\noften a big decision \u2014 projects typically have major impacts and major opportunity costs; and it\nshould not be surprising that demanding requirements need to be met.\nThe policies of the banks in these respects are summarized in Table 6.\n10\nADB is involved in various stages of appraisal and loan processing for other projects, including: Ciawi-Sukabumi\n(Indonesia - suspended); Guangzhou-Zuhai (dormant); Delhi Bridge (India - active: ADB would invest US$5 million\nequity and lend US$20 million of a US$100 million project); Pasig Expressway (Philippines - active), Chaing RaiLaos-\nKunming (active).", "EEAcsTCDotecnsoreucaoRvsmvhttniereerenpyoosqlgia/omncssuytpmameiiibcmrlcleeelayteneom nl lFtnyrtwae etl Vin BatIhtismaasibnbpllkaeect YYYcMfuoeeeulmfsssisllmt  csitoetTeneaet rtbdah cla&eAttu   Dgha6Boal: vv oee b r l npi gmo a leiDttiinocetnasvl  aewrlielol ptoemYYMneRceeocetusosm qsBntum oaibrmieentmnsykIF ee gCfnRiott veloeqcrnaumlireenmt ents YfYUriEeMwtnoereecIpaituvRtsreosh-nse  trnRisotI&nnn onp.-uha   dmoapvBeatair uo vyeottsc. ebennltop l,uavei htocsdrlfe elia titycpcasmrn oeyat bsetnnEreioy-tttsBi io ,nocui lnfoRins-tlpdtct uD ahaiaeismnnetlpit to-ap e&sanPia nn r &ictdSana tt ebtslrPssenal euor&tf nf i E tinarcafeaxa tbi&qlotplliueonrinareealsdlswYacGNrfYcieoeneyooohusasmtsva. nne sbptNcrrpirniylenoiet mwgmacre/tei fiaigpsoincsuerntaso l  amlejplaeyttIroul cAlo tsrtrjDyestea  ,lBcia nsgetyps ixbsfpfepetlreeraoa .mnvs eReis xbm iceoi&lli-nuuty sd&te ndot                                                                             2\n9\nInstitutionally & Investment in private sector of a Must have good prospect Appropriate legal framework, state Borrower must be established\nFinancially DMC.

Expressways and the Road Network\n1. Road Network Priorities\nThe importance of the road network to delivering national social and economic objectives is\nrarely matched by the performance of government in providing infrastructure of the right quality and\nquantity. These problems are often not marginal, but reflect a fundamental failure over a prolonged\nperiod, and frequently after repeated assistance from development banks.\nThe problems in the Philippines are just one example (Allport, 1998, op cit):\n\u201cThe core problem is institutional, in that the Department of Public Works and\nHighways (DPWH) is not sufficiently proactive in maintaining and developing the\nnational road network. The symptoms of this problem are many: there is no\nstrategy for the sector, with priorities for what to do, how, where and when; there\nis a patchy picture of maintenance, some good but much that is not good;\nplanning is substantially ineffective; design and construction are often poor, with\nlengthy construction times, which reduce estimates of economic viability, and\nthe performance of some contractors is questionable; and there are still large\nareas with network deficiencies.\nThe causes are understood. First and foremost, politics intrude very extensively\nin the sector. This has almost completely subverted the planning and\nimplementation process. The road investment and maintenance budgets are\napproved annually by Congress, and are under constant uncertainty. In addition,\nfunding is spread far too thinly, leading to patchy and insufficient project\nimplementation. As a result, DPWH has found it increasingly difficult to develop\nand implement a clear, coherent strategy, and to deliver what it is mandated to\ndeliver. Moreover, funds for national roads are allocated by DPWH to regions\naccording to a \u2018block allocation\u2019 formula - a system that does not meet actual\nengineering needs or stated physical policy objectives.\u201d\nThis is a common story throughout the developing world. It is paradoxical that side-by-side\nwith this profound failure - which impacts upon virtually the whole national road network, massive\nnew BOT expressway(s) monopolize the attention - projects which typically make only a small\naddition to the network.\nIt is necessary to establish an overview of the sector needs and priorities, before\nconcluding that major investment in new expressways is justified. To continue the previous\nexample for the Philippines, the priorities for the current plan period (1999-2004) were\nestablished (Allport, 1998 op cit):", "31\nTable 7: Strategic Priorities for the Roads Sector: An Example - Philippines\nCategory                   Description                              Required Scale of\n   Expenditure\nMaintenance Routine and periodic Substantial\nRehabilitation Reconstruction of the road structure Substantial\nImprovement Upgrading pavement design/bridges for Substantial (most of the\nheavier traffic network)\nRoad widening/realignment and junction\nimprovements to increase capacity\nBypasses to avoid traffic bottlenecks\nSafety improvements\nDevelopment New roads to stimulate development Small/very small\n(Penetrator) Roads (agriculture, mining, tourism)\nMissing Links New roads. Priority to port/airport access Small/very small\nroads\n2. Development and Transport Strategy\nRoads are not an objective in themselves, but a means of providing accessibility, and\nthereby achieving economic, development, social and environmental objectives.\nTable 8: Expressway Objectives\nObjective Impact of Road Investment\nEconomic efficiency Improved accessibility by reducing congestion and increasing capacity \u2014\naccommodating increased traffic.\nImproved allocation of resources, by introducing user charges.\nDevelopment Development is encouraged in one area/corridor over another.\nSocial Impact on the poor/disadvantaged as a result of land acquisition/relocation/\nconstruction.\nImpact on accessibility for the poor/disadvantaged.\nImpact on traffic accidents.\nEnvironment Impact on sensitive areas.\nImpact on severance, visual intrusion, air pollution and noise.\nExpressways typically have one or more of the following objectives:\n\u2022 Link town A to town B more effectively (improve the accessibility of A and B), or\n\u2022 Develop the corridor A to B (or develop an expanding area in a city/region).", "32\nThey may have subsidiary objectives to:\n\u2022 Relieve existing town centers of through traffic, particularly trucks, and\n\u2022 Improve access for low-income travelers.\nRoads have a huge impact upon the physical development of a city or region. If a road is\nbuilt, then development is widely observed to follow it; by comparison if it is not built, or not improved,\nthen development takes place much more slowly. Over a period of one or two generations these\nchanges have a profound impact upon the structure of a city or region.\nThe starting point is to ask \u2018What (city or sub-regional or regional) development strategy\nis road investment required to assist in bringing about?\u2019 Given such a development strategy a\ntransport strategy needs to be formulated. This will determine the priorities for road investment,\nin the context of economic and social objectives and environmental, funding and institutional\nconstraints.\nNot all roads are a good thing. They may profoundly distort the development of a city,\ncause unjustifiable dislocation or destroy habitats, or create major operational problems. Many\ntransport corridors comprise other modes too, and the transport strategy needs to determine\nthe right balance of investment and policies. Ill-founded road investment can undermine such\na strategy.\nIn summary, road investment will only be effective if carried out in the context of an\nacceptable development and transport strategy. We return to this issue later in the report, and\nreview the way that Asia\u2019s governments have sought to use expressway investment to further\ntheir policy objectives.\nSuffice to say now that typically expressway studies are undertaken (expressway meaning\nhere limited-access grade-separated high-capacity roads) in a vacuum, without:\n\u2022 A meaningful development strategy (defining the objectives of transport strategy).\n\u2022 A transport strategy (defining the roles of roads, rail, buses etc. and identifying which\ncorridors should incorporate expressways).\n\u2022 A realistic assessment of available public funding.\nInstead, an expressway network is typically developed and recommended, almost always\na hugely ambitious network, which assumes that the private sector will somehow fund it. The\nresult is that government is led to believe that this can - and should happen, whereas neither is\nthe case.\n3. Towards Commercialization\nBefore becoming involved in the detail, it is helpful to look forward - say 25 years, and to\nhave some perspective on the direction of change in the roads sector. This is already becoming\napparent, and is best described as \u2018commercialization\u2019.\nThe roads sector is different from other infrastructure sectors, because it is not\ncommercial. Users of telecommunications or electricity or ports or railways or airports pay for\ntheir use \u2013 and the more they use, the greater the payment. The same is true in many countries\n(where water is metered) for water. But it is not so for road transport. Drivers pay annual\nlicenses to use the roads and gasoline/diesel has a large tax element - but these payments are", "33\nneither recognized as payments for access/use (governments take the proceeds into the general\nfund), nor do they vary with cost (the basis of economic pricing). Thus, while a telecoms\ncompany offers price discounts to encourage off-peak traffic and a price supplement at peak\ntimes when users willingness-to-pay is high, there is no price mechanism in the roads sector,\nsolely congestion - the great leveler, affecting everyone, those with valuable and those with\ntrivial journeys, equally.\nProgress to full commercialization is speculative, but is increasingly discussed as a\npossible development in the sector (most recently in Roth 1996). Roth describes the basic\ncomponents of a commercial road system, which would substantially remove government from\nthe business of planning, financing, implementing, managing, operating, and maintaining the\nroad system as:\n\u2022 There would be owners.\n\u2022 They would be financially self-supporting.\n\u2022 Revenues would go to those who earn them, not to governments.\n\u2022 They would operate to common standards to facilitate inter-connection.\nOne possible approach is described:\n\u2022 The national road system would be geographically divided into sectors.\n\u2022 Ownership would be vested in road corporations.\n\u2022 Road corporations would manage and operate the sectors.\n\u2022 New private corporations could be formed to provide new roads.\n\u2022 The road corporations would be regulated by government to safeguard the assets.\n\u2022 Income could be from user charges supplemented by tolling which would be\ndedicated to a roads fund.\n\u2022 Revenues would be distributed between road corporations on a traffic-related basis.\nImplementation steps are suggested:\n\u2022 Bring about institutional reforms \u2014 the main obstacle to reform.\n\u2022 Introduce \u2018shadow tolls\u2019 - which enable new road providers to enter the market and\nshoulder some of the major risks.\n\u2022 Establish dedicated road funds.\n\u2022 Develop electronic methods of charging for road use (already advanced).\n\u2022 Government to be responsible for creating a competitive market for roads, ensuring\nconsistent technical and safety/environmental standards.\n4. PSP Modalities\nThe typical PSP modality for Asian expressways has been that of BOT \u2014 new\nconstruction undertaken and financed in the private sector with operation and toll collection to\nsecure financing over a 20 to 30 year period, after which the asset returns to government. This\nhas  been  used  in  all  of  the  case  study  countries  and  dominates  thinking  within  the  Asian\ntransport sector.\nThere are other options for involving the private sector however, which allow differing\ntransfers of responsibility and risk and can be appropriate when the government is concerned to\nensure contract stability and economic viability of the project. These other forms of contract can\nalso be useful in developing private sector capacity to undertake activities which had previously", "34\nbeen in the public domain and where the public sector contract management skills are still under\ndevelopment.\nNot all of these forms of contract require tolls to be levied, since less financial responsibility\nis being transferred away from the government. Where tolls are levied, depending on the revenue\nderived and the obligations of the private sector, payments may be made to the government.\nThese options can also be used where there is an existing road or network of roads, and\nthe government is seeking to improve maintenance or to rehabilitate the road (and yet not bear the\ncost or associated risks).\nThe full spectrum of PSP modalities in order of risk transfer to the private sector are as\nfollows:\n\u2022 Maintenance Management Contracts \u2014 the private sector maintains an existing\nroad under performance specifications, for which it receives payments from the\ngovernment.\n\u2022 Turnkey Contracts \u2014 the private sector designs and constructs a new road, to\ngovernment specifications, and receives a fixed payment on completion.\n\u2022 Operation (tolling) and Maintenance Contracts \u2014 the private sector maintains the\nroad to agreed standards, and collects tolls from users which finance the maintenance.\n\u2022 Rehabilitation, Maintenance and Operation \u2014 the private sector undertakes\nsignificant rehabilitation works to bring the existing road to agreed standards, maintains\nit to those standards, and collects tolls to finance both rehabilitation and maintenance.\n\u2022 BOT \u2014 the private sector undertakes and finances design, construction, tolling, and\nmaintenance, usually of large infrastructure projects. The private sector can also bear\nmuch of the risk \u2014 depending on the negotiated concession agreement.\n\u2022 Corridor Management Contracts \u2014 the private sector undertakes new construction\nand the maintenance (or rehabilitation) and operation of existing facilities. It allows\ngovernment and the private sector to consider the roads on a corridor or network basis.\nThese options are described further later in the report.", "35\nII. EXPERIENCE\nThis section reviews experience in Asia and other parts of the world, before drawing\nconclusions about the degrees of success that have been achieved.\nIn Asia the focus is on: Hong Kong, China; Malaysia; Philippines; and Thailand - case study\ncountries which offer experience and insights to guide future policy. Appendix 1 describes these in\nsome detail.\nAppendix 2 describes other relevant experience, which highlights examples of interest or\ninnovation.\nA. Asia\n1. BOT Expressway Projects\nTable 9 summarizes the BOT activity in Asia - this is a summary of more detailed project\ninformation provided in Appendixes 1, 2, and 3.\nAfter a decade of effort, and huge rhetoric, there are just 20 operational projects, with a\nfurther 32 under construction (see Table 9).\nWhen set against the problems, this is a surprisingly short list. One country, Malaysia,\ndominates and represents one-half of total activity, while seven countries have negligible activity in\nterms of construction and operational projects.\nThere are a large number of projects being planned or at pre-planning. This covers\neverything from serious pre-bid activity to little more than pre-feasibility assessment. Before the\nrecent economic crisis, the realism of many projects was questionable. Now many such projects\nare dormant.\nThe types of project vary by country. In Thailand and the Philippines the projects are\nconcentrated in the capital city, and the radial roads leading from it; while in Malaysia the projects\nhave been used to help open up the country, with a mix of urban and inter-urban projects. In Hong\nKong, China; the project finance capital of Asia, is notable in that all projects have been (or in the\ncase of Route 3, incorporated major) tunnels.\nThe obvious questions that follow in the light of huge problems and the limited amount of\nactivity to date are:\n\u2022 How can the BOT process be improved, to deliver more projects?\n\u2022 Are there other options to BOT, which may be more effective?", "Table 9:        Expressway BOT Concessions in Asia\n      Country No. of Projects by Project Status No Projects by Type\nOpen Construction Plannng Pre-Planning Abandoned Total Urban Inter-Urban Bridge/Tunnel\nBangladesh - - 1 - - 1 1 - -\nMyanmar - - - - - - - - -\nHong Kong, 4 1 - - - 5 - 1 4\nChina\nIndia - - 11 4 - 15 2 9 4\nIndonesia 2 6 7 20 - 35 11 23 1\nLao PDR - - 1 - - 1 - 1 -\nMalaysia 9 15 8 8 - 40 18 19 3\nPakistan 1 - 3 - - 4 - 4 -\nPhilippines -11 5 9 1 - 15 9 6 -\n3\n6\nSri Lanka - - 1 - - 1 - 1 -\nTaipei, China - - - - - - - - -\nThailand 4 5 2 112 2 14 11 3 -\nViet Nam - - - 1 - 1 - 1 -\nTOTAL 20 32 43 35 2 132 52 68 12\nPRC13 21 - 11 3 - 35mostly inter-urban, including several bridges\nNotes: Based upon the consultants\u2019 database of BOT projects-Appendix 3 reproduces summary informatio\nThe information is comprehensive - apart from PRC, where the picture is complicated by many deals and arranged projects.

Alternative (non-BOT) Examples of PSP\nFor reasons that are not obvious, there has been a fixation with massive BOT projects in\nAsia, with very little interest in other, lower-cost forms of PSP. The only examples we are aware\nof are:\n\u2022 In Hong Kong, China, management contracts have been let for government tunnels\n(Aberdeen, Lion Rock, etc).\n\u2022 Also in Hong Kong, China, the Tsing Ma Control Area management contract has been\nlet, to manage a single major corridor (leading to the new airport), and featuring an\ninnovative traffic control system.\n\u2022 In Pakistan, it is intended to sell the operating concession for the Lahore-Islamabad\nexpressway, the project having been constructed under government funding (via a\nKorean contractor).\n\u2022 Management contracts were let 20 years ago for the Manila North and South\nexpressways. The contractor was required to levy tolls and maintain the road, until\nthe capital cost was amortized (after which it was to revert to government, and tolls\nwere to be removed).\n3. Case Studies\nAppendix 1 reports on the case studies for Hong Kong, China; Malaysia; Philippines; and\nThailand; which were effective in illuminating the key issues. These built on a working knowledge\nof the countries and sector, supplemented by a study tour, which benefited from the assistance\nof many individuals and organizations.\nTable 10 summarizes the project characteristics:\n\u2022 The case studies include 17 of Asia\u2019s 20 operational BOT projects, and 20 of the\nprojects under construction (these figures exclude PRC for which information is\nincomplete, but where activity is extensive).\n\u2022 All countries have plans for major future programs. Malaysia, which has 18 projects\nopen or under construction, plans to double this network. This points to the scale of\nactivity in the sector - and it reinforces the embryonic stage of development almost\neverywhere else.\n\u2022 More than half the projects are urban.

About one-third overall\nwould be foreign funding. This varies very much by country, it is negligible in Malaysia, but high in\nthe Philippines (for example, Skyway was virtually all foreign funding).\n19 Direct - meaning intended in cash or kind. Government may have contingent liabilities which get called when project\nfinances go wrong.\n20 Based on substantive information, pro-rated for missing information, and converted to US$ at existing (post-economic\ncrisis) exchange rates.\n21 Consultant estimate, based on knowledge of many of the projects.\n22 With existing BOT process.\n23 Consultant estimate based on available information.\n24 The revenue sources are predominantly tolls (plus small ancillary concessions, advertising). The costs are: bidding,\ndesign, land, construction, equipment, maintenance, asset replacement together with dividends. This profitability criterion asks\nwhether the revenues will fund the operating costs, repay debt and provide a reasonable return to shareholders - without\ngovernment support.", "40\nPerhaps the main conclusion, and one that underpins this subject, is that few BOT projects\nare intrinsically profitable - meaning that their revenues fund all their development, capital, operating\nand asset replacement costs and provide an acceptable return to shareholders. It is estimated,\nbased on discussions with government, concessionaires and banks, and from observation and\nanalysis that no more than three to five of existing BOT projects in the case study countries are\ntruly profitable.\nB. Other Experience\nAppendix 2 describes relevant experiences in the remainder of the world. This is selected\nto provide insights relevant to future policy not available from the case studies.\nIn Asia the focus is on:\n\u2022 PRC - because of its importance, and because it is different (expressways are often\nprofitable).\n\u2022 The Indian Sub-continent - because of its importance, and because it is currently at the\nlower end of the income range, and yet is actively pursuing BOT policies.\n\u2022 Indonesia - because of its importance, and because it has been active in realigning its\npolicy to the requirements of the post-crisis world.\nElsewhere the focus is on:\n\u2022 Latin America - because there has been much lower-cost innovation.\n\u2022 Eastern Europe - because it too is different, and has lessons from applying BOT policies.\n\u2022 UK - because it has been a leader in this field, and has pioneered the design-build-\nfinance-operate (DBFO) approach.\n\u2022 France, Italy, and Spain - which have all developed large expressway networks, but\nhave had to progressively involve Government.\n\u2022 United States (US) - which has a large expressway network, and has innovated.\n\u2022 Australasia - Australia which is actively pursuing a BOT policy, and New Zealand which\nhas pioneered re-engineering of the government machine to improve management of\nthe roads, and is moving to introducing user-charges.\n\u2022 South Africa - which is also developing major expressways through a BOT policy.\nC. Degrees of Success\n1. Overview\nThis section bring together the Asian and other international experience, to:\n\u2022 Assess its degrees of success in meeting the objectives for expressway PSP defined\nin Table 12.\n\u2022 Summarize what has been learned concerning its impact on the key issues set out in\nTable 13.", "41\na.         Asia is Different\nIt is clear that in two respects Asia is currently different to other regions of the world: there\nis an exclusive concentration on BOT to the exclusion of other forms of PSP; and there is a\nconcentration on urban projects. Asian countries have generally planned huge expressway systems\non the basis of optimistic growth assumptions that some countries have indeed achieved, on the\nassumption that they represent a sound basis of transport policy. This has been done almost\nuniformly without attention to public sector affordability, because the projects were expected to be\nprofitable for the private sector.\nBy contrast, in Latin America, PSP policies have been devised against a background of\nsevere economic problems - what has been implemented has been that which could clearly be\nafforded, and often they were assisted by the World Bank or IADB. Urban hierarchies are different\ntoo - with many large cities, whereas many Asian countries are primate, with activity dominated by\nthe capital city and the roads radiating from it, and lower levels of traffic on the inter-urban road\nnetwork.\nWestern Europe has virtually no urban expressways, partly because of public concern\nabout their acceptability, and partly because of a recognition of their lack of merit in contributing to\nsustainable transport policy; while large inter-urban expressways have been developed by both the\nprivate and public sectors, but mostly requiring substantial public sector support.\nIn Eastern Europe, pressure for expressways comes from Western Europe which is both\ntheir role model, and political objective. For the European Union (EU) has invested hugely in its\nperipheral lower-income member states, to reduce income disparities; and there is an expectation\nthat as the EU expands, the countries of Eastern Europe will benefit from similar investment in\ninfrastructure.\nThe United States has been slower to get onto the BOT bandwagon because of the\ninterstate highway system, which has created a highly developed inter-urban highway network\nsince the 1950s, and because of the social backlash against urban expressways in the 1 960s\nand 70s. Hence, little new construction was considered until the 1 980s when urban radial roads\nwere beginning to be considered to relieve traffic congestion. However, there remains little\ninterest because: the projects are still very political; there were early failures (e.g., Dulles\nTollway); and perhaps because of the difficulty of US employment law which does not allow\ngovernment funds to be spent on projects which will put existing government units out of\nbusiness.", "42\nTable 12: Degrees of Success in Meeting PSP Objectives\n    Objective              Examples of Degrees of Success\n1. Political\nImplement Achieved on a massive scale in Mexico (unsuccessful), and Malaysia (mixed experience).\nsomething Individual projects implemented with difficulty, e.g., Don Muang Tollway (Bangkok), Skyway (Manila).\nGeneral conclusion is that the private sector is limited in what it can achieve, without strong government\n(this refers to: its ability to plan, purchase and clear land, award necessary permits, and get political\nacceptance of the scheme).\nCreate an Preserves social cohesion: a major objective of PSP in Malaysia, to develop a bumiputra\nEntrepreneurial entrepreneurial class.

Ability to introduce! PRC is an exception - tolls readily used, acceptable, often no realistic free\nincrease tolls alternative. But in other countries:\nTolls are always difficult to introduce e.g., Thailand.\nA free alternative is normally required by government.\nConcessionaire\u2019s and government objectives are in conflict.\nThe location of toilgates very sensitive: Mozambique-South Africa N4, KL\nCheras, Mexico are examples.\nToll increases are almost uniformly subject to political interference: in Thailand,\nMexico, to some extent Malaysia, and until the Toll Stability Fund, even Hong\nKong, China.\nUndoubtedly PSP reduces \u2018leakage\u2019, which is common with government projects.\n3. Macroeceonomic effects: Yes in Mexico: crowding out domestic markets and requiring foreign funding,\nwith disastrous results.\nCrowding out other Maybe an issue in Malaysia, where the scale of investment relative to market\ninvestment size has been large.\nForeign exchange Mexico demonstrated the crippling impact of devaluation on unprotected project\nexposure finances.\nA major current concern in the wake of recent devaluations, emphasising the\nimportance of domestic financing.\nCertainly a concern in Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia.\nMisallocation of Resources Where much has happened quickly, there is particular concern that economic internal\nrates of return (EIRRs) are poor or mixed. Certainly so in Mexico, mixed performance in\nMalaysia, concern in Thailand.\nMany projects have questionable EIRR\u2019s, with traffic much less than estimated.\nBecause investment costs are very large relative to the roads sector budget (yet\nlots of rehabilitation and maintenance is needed on existing roads), the\nopportunity cost of misallocation is large - reducing future economic growth.\n4. Development of Domestic The hypothesis is that PSP may develop new financial mechanisms and\nCapital Markets products, with widespread benefits. No evidence was obtained one way or the\nother, except perhaps in the stock market floatations in Malaysia and Hong\nKong, China.\n27 Reference should be made to sections 4,5 and Appendix 2 for detail.", "44\nTable 13:           Impact on Key Expressway PSP Issues (continued)\n                Issue Impact\n5.Road Network Where much is done quickly, there is little opportunity to learn from mistakes \u2014\nDevelopment Mexico and Malaysia are examples.\nNo evidence that private groups are developing strategic networks \u2014 except\nPace of network Malaysia where Renong are prominent in the transport sector.\ndevelopment?

One result is the abandonment of Hopewell.\n6.Impact on Development When concessions are let (often without construction taking place), and in the\nand Transport Strategy absence of clear policy, the result can become a straightjacket, which constrains\nfuture government action. This describes Bangkok \u2014 almost every corridor has\nConcessions may constrain one or more BOT prolects.\nand/or distort strategy, by High land prices and the attempt to find profits result in BOT projects\nconcentration on the major concentrating along existing transport corridors, rather than new alignments\ncorridors opening up areas for development. Urban efficiency requires megablocks to be\nbroken up, but PSP makes this less likely.\nThe BOT approach is sometimes market-led, focused on the capital and roads\nradiating from it. Most such projects still require substantial government\ninvestment. The result may be to starve high priority/lower-cost projects, and\ndisadvantaged regions of public investment. This is in prospect in the Philippines.\n7.Social/Environmental There is little evidence that projects are designed to secure social equity or\nissues environmental objectives.\nThere is however no evidence that PSP circumvents government requirements\nConcessions may affect the regarding land acquisition, relocation and compensation. In Bangkok revaluing\napplication of social and land at market prices increased the cost of all BOT projects markedly.\nenvironmental policy Neither is there compelling evidence that direct impact of BOT projects (visual,\nseverance etc) are worse or better than other projects.\n8.Development of road Companies have developed in the UK and elsewhere.\ntransport companies But in Asia, concession companies are usually strongly construction-led.\nIn Hong Kong, China the later winning concessionaires (Western Harbour Tunnel\nand Route 3) have not included any contractor equity \u2014 a preferred arrangement.\n9.Procurement BOT processes vary hugely. Hong Kong, China is without doubt the benchmark in\nAsia. Many countries secure little or no competition or risk transfer, with obvious\nresults.\nThe absence of transparent procurement processes can readily result in\nsubstantial corruption, which frustrates the core PSP objectives.\n10. Implementation Traffic congestion during construction is a concern, but is surprisingly well managed,\nand not a serious problem.\nFailed implementation is rare. When it occurs it is problematic. This faces the Thai authori-\nties re Hopewell.\n11. Political There is sometimes a fear of \u2018re-colonization\u2019 by foreigners. This exists in Eastern\nEurope, but not in Asia.\nThere is sometimes concern to protect government jobs. This stopped the\nHungary M3, and has been a problem in Poland too.\n12. Role of international IFI\u2019s play almost no direct role in project financing.\n   financial institutions This is for a variety of reasons: the size and economic viability of the projects,\nconcerns about their preparation, concerns about competitive procurement etc.\nIn Asia the sole expressway involvement has been Bangkok Second Stage\nExpressway (ADB).", "    45\nWe started this report by noting that there were two generic arguments for PSP - a need for\nprivate funding so that political aspirations could be implemented, and a belief in PSP as the better\nway to improve sector efficiency. It is notable that those countries that support the second argument:\nfor example, UK; Hong Kong, China; and Australasia \u2014 have not developed huge expressway\nBOT networks, but rather targeted individual BOT investments, and developed alternative PSP\nmodalities, widely.\n2. Conclusions\nThe overwhelming conclusion is that in Asia it is early days for PSP:\n\u2022 Despite the rhetoric, there are not many projects: just 20 operational to date (with\nmany more in PRC).\n\u2022 Only a handful of projects are profitable - they are the exception. Clearly, the\nwidespread belief that \u2018BOT expressways make money\u2019 is, outside PRC, incorrect.\nThis conclusion is reinforced by all the evidence in Asia, Latin America, Western\nEurope, and in Eastern Europe.\n\u2022 It is difficult to make unprofitable projects profitable without radical changes in\ngovernment policy towards the road sector. Linking property development to\nexpressways is rarely an answer (the revenues are uncertain, and few banks will lend\non the basis of them). Providing substantial assets certainly helps \u2014 for example, an\nexisting un-tolled expressway or tunnel, when tolled and extended may indeed be\nprofitable as a private concession.\n\u2022 There is a very mixed performance against the stated PSP objectives - some good but\nmuch that is not good:\n- Implementation, yes - some projects, but not always in the public interest.\n- Better implementation: faster usually, lower-cost only sometimes (depending on\nthe extent of competition).\n- Substantial private funds mobilized, but often underwritten by government - and\nmore limited amounts of risk capital.\n- Better travel for inter-urban road users, but in cities expressways certainly (alone)\ndo not solve traffic congestion.\n- Certainly advances in understanding risks - a major advance; but often risks\nsubsumed by government, explicitly or implicitly.\n- Innovation - yes, many good examples but usually isolated (see below).\n\u2022 There are varying impacts on the key issues identified:\n- Little evidence that the private sector can alone make projects happen.\n- Almost always problems introducing tolls, with the location of tollgates sensitive.\nPervasive interference in allowing contracted toll increases to occur.", "46\n- Evidence that implementing too much too quickly is risky, resulting in a substantial\nmisallocation of resources (with no chance to learn from experience) and may\nalso have adverse macroeconomic effects.\n- A  public  policy  question  concerning  the  development  of  an  integrated\nexpressway network from individual (competing) concessionaires: how is this\nto be done? No one yet has the answer.\n- Concern that the policy is distorting public investment priorities substantially\nby default, because of the wide ption that projects are profitable, and the\ncontingent liabilities many governments take on, and are then called.\n- Concern that corruption is undermining the core PSP objectives.\n- Concern too that the policy is not encouraging urban efficiency, rather reinforcing\nexisting transport taxes, and failing to bring inaccessible land into development.\n- Little evidence that social equity objectives are incorporated in projects, when\nthey could be.\n- Reassurance that the policy is not subverting governments\u2019 environmental and social\npolicies.\n- Reassurance that traffic disruption during implementation is by-and-large well-\nmanaged.\n\u2022 Many aspects of PSP are relatively primitive:\n- In Asia, PSP is often assumed to mean BOT projects, which is surprising -\nBOT projects are the exception, and will only rarely be widely implemented.\nThere is, by contrast, no use of lower-cost PSP options, which have the\npotential to be applied widely.\n- Emphasis is almost exclusively on implementing a construction project, rather\nthan on improving the level of service in the transport corridor - which requires\nother issues to be addressed such as: integration with the existing roads,\nconserving the capacity of existing roads, reducing accidents, minimizing\ndisruption from incidents, maintenance, etc.\n- BOT projects comprise huge pieces of infrastructure, whose construction it would\nseem natural to stage. Yet Hungary M5 and some of the expressways in Buenos\nAires are the only examples we are aware of.\n- Tolls only rarely derive from public policy objectives, rather they are the results\nof the bidding process. Yet it is clear they are important in determining the impact\nof expressways and therefore their rationale. If tolls for trucks are high (the normal\ncase), few trucks use the expressway. If tolls for buses are low (as in one case\n-Malaysia), then the benefits for low-income travelers are huge.", "    47\n- Tariffs are often optimized for revenue-maximization on opening, then allowed to\nbecome hugely sub-optimal. And they are often determined by the precedent of the\nfirst project (as in Malaysia), unrelated to the specifics of each particular project\n(which a user charge should do).\n\u2022 There are many examples of innovation. Some hold great promise. Yet they ar.e almost\nalways isolated, confined to one project or one country.\n\u2022 Governments are only now coming to terms with the scale of government commitment\nresulting from BOT projects - in kind, as investment, or through guarantees (contingent\nliabilities) being called.\n\u2022 The absence of value-for-money analyses or before-and-after studies is striking.\na. Impact of the Economic Crisis\nWhile evidence is patchy, there is reason to believe that PSP processes are improving,\noften with the assistance of the major multilateral development banks. In the Philippines, ADB\nhas assisted government carry out a Transport Strategy Study, focused upon action to improve\nPSP sector-wide; and it is currently preparing a loan, providing capacity-building support to\ngovernment, improving PSP processes and identifying possible hybrid projects for\nimplementation.\nIn Indonesia, the Government recognizes that in spite of many successes, past practices\nhad their shortcomings, and it is now actively reforming the legislative and regulatory frameworks,\nand improving the process of project identification and procurement. Presidential decree No. 7\napproved in January 1998 requires open competitive bidding for all infrastructure projects, that\nsuch projects should have been identified as priorities by Government, and that unsolicited bids\nwould also be subject to competitive bidding. ADB is providing loan assistance for a Transport\nStrategy Study to build upon these initiatives.\nIn Malaysia, the Government is revisiting its PSP processes, in particular its automatic\nunderwriting of bank loans, and is considering how to deal with the many project developers who\nhave applied for government financial assistance.\nThese are all promising signs that the window of opportunity which the economic crisis has\nopened is indeed being grasped. PSP processes are likely to be better suited to the future when\neconomic growth reasserts itself.\nb. Overall Conclusion\nThe overall conclusion based upon all the case studies and other available evidence is\nthat:\n\u2022 Much needs to change, before the required benefits of PSP in this sector are\nrealized.\n\u2022 Implementing a successful BOT policy is very demanding \u2014 only Hong Kong, China in\nAsia achieves this, and nowhere else is yet close.", "48\n\u2022 There is much to learn from the case studies, and these offer great potential to improve\nthe BOT process.\n\u2022 Other PSP modalities hold considerable promise, are less demanding to implement\nand may have more to offer than the BOT process, given the economic needs of most\nAsian countries, including the rehabilitation or improved maintenance of the existing\nroad network.\n\u2022 Events since the economic crisis offer hope that change is taking place.\nIII. KEY ISSUES\nThis section of the report identifies the key issues established from the review of current\npractice, and the implications for best practices.\nA. Expressways are Different\nPSP in infrastructure was applied first in the power sector in most Asian countries. Usually\nthis was for power generation plants which could be sited remotely, and where the deal involved\nmodification to an existing concession contract. This model of privatization is still perceived to be\nsuccessful by many \u2014 albeit that it has now been widely superseded, for two reasons:\n\u2022 First, because the contracts have not stood up to the recent economic crisis \u2014 they\nwere formulated without anticipating the large currency devaluations and the reduced\ndemand for power which has resulted.\n\u2022 Second, because the privatization of the power sector is now recognized as being far\nmore complex, first requiring consideration of the whole structure of the industry, and\nthen the development of a strategy for implementation of the inter-related elements.\nNevertheless, the expectations of many of the key players for BOT expressways are usually\nbenchmarked against this perception of success. Even in these terms however, the expectations\nof success are misplaced \u2013 because expressways are seen to be very different from power\nstations (Table 14).", "49\nTable 14:  Characteristics of Power and Expressway Projects\n        CHARACTERISTIC                        POWER STATION EXPRESSWAY\nProject Identification Straightforward Demanding (not all expressways ar\u2018good\u2019,\nproblems with competing projects)\nCost High - but costs spread over High - but all costs up-front (operating costs are low)\nlife (operating costs are high)\nLocation Remote In the middle of big cities, or major developed\ncorridors\nLand requirements Small: a single site for the Large: Often in central locations, often a continuous\npower station strip (difficult acquisition)\nEnvironmental impact Small (remote location) Large for elevated structure, medium for others.\nInvolves extensive land acquisition/relocation\nIntegration requirements Considerable Extensive \u2014 traffic depends upon effective\nintegration with the transport system\nTariff problems Same (at least people Huge: roads are \u2018free\u2019 to use\nalready pay for electricity) There is almost always a \u2018free alternative\u2019\nA separate negotiation for each project\nDemand/Revenues\n\u2022 Size High - fixed from day 1 Low in early years\n\u2022 Uncertainty Certain (defined in the Uncertain in the future (depends on external factors)\nconcession agreement)\nFinancial Viability as a Viable Not viable (only a few projects are viable)\nstand-alone project.\nComplexity Power station output often Expressway small relative to the network.

Why Prepare Forecasts?\nMost forecasts are prepared either for project sponsors or bankers, before the\nimplementation of an expressway. Sponsors are concerned primarily that the project is financially\nviable and proceeds (allowing them to secure short-term construction profits). Bankers are\nconcerned to ensure their loans are repaid. In some instances, repayment is guaranteed by\ngovernment within concession agreements, but usually the banks are at some risk, and then\nthey are concerned with downside risk - specifically: what is the probability of the revenue stream\nbeing so low that repayment is threatened?\nNeither of these parties typically has an understanding of traffic and revenue forecasts.\n2. Expectations and Reality\nProject sponsors, and many bankers too, believe that it is not difficult to forecast traffic.\nThis report dispels that view, which is a principal cause for the problems in this sector.\nAlthough toll roads represent significant investments by developers (and often governments),\nthere seems little understanding of why some traffic uses a toll road whilst other traffic does not, or\nof the resistance to tolls by companies/drivers of all vehicle categories, or of the likely growth in\neither traffic or revenues. Rather, there is a widespread belief that expressways should make\nmoney; and sometimes the forecasts are required to justify this.28\nRevenue projections are too often based on forecasting studies which are severely\nlimited by time and budget constraints. This reveals ignorance of the complexities of traffic\nforecasting. Thus, it is usual for sponsors to invest a substantial amount in technical studies,\ncost estimation, and in financial and legal advisers; but only a small amount to determine the\nrevenue stream \u2014 on which expectations of profits and debt repayment principally depend.\nThis failure to invest adequately in traffic studies leads to the lack of essential information\nabout existing traffic characteristics in the proposed toll road corridor, and a simplified forecasting\nmodel using limited and sometimes poor inputs. The result is often very unrealistic outputs,\nwhich are misleadingly used to demonstrate the project\u2019s apparent financial viability.\nTraffic and revenue projections are typically developed as follows:\n\u2022 Traffic surveys are carried out in the corridor of the proposed toll road, usually\ncomprising some (but rarely all) of: traffic counts classified by vehicle type, origin-\ndestination surveys, stated or revealed preference surveys29 to establish users\u2019\nwillingness-to-pay tolls, and journey time surveys.\n\u2022 Other data are collated on land uses (current and projected), historic traffic, and\neconomic growth.\n28 We hasten to add that this is the last thing a professional consultant should accept, but it is nevertheless far too common an\noccurrence.\n29 Revealed  preference  surveys  are  based  upon  observations  of  how  drivers  behave  when  faced  with  an  expressway\n(unfortunately there is relatively little such evidence). Stated preference surveys estimate response based upon surveys\nwith potential users, who are presented with a series of trade-off questions. Both approaches are required, additionally\ndrawing upon international comparisons.", "   51\n\u2022 A traffic-forecasting model is developed, validated to base year conditions, which\nproduces traffic and revenue forecasts for a few specific future years, for a range of\nscenarios.\n\u2022 A revenue stream for the project concession period is developed by interpolation and\nextrapolation of the model revenue forecasts.\nThe forecasts require assumptions about generated traffic - new traffic not previously\nmade in the corridor, and resulting from the expressway - this may result in a significant addition\n(e.g., 10 percent - 20 percent) to traffic determined by the model. Simple forecasts are prepared\nfor economic growth and the growth in vehicle ownership, while government or other external\nforecasts are typically used for population/land use (which may or may not have been well\ndeveloped). Whilst forecasts are usually prepared for a limited number of separate vehicle classes\n(e.g., cars and goods vehicles) the number of vehicle classes is often less than the number of\ntolled categories which will be enforced when the toll road opens. Forecasts may be prepared for\ndifferent time periods during the day (especially in urban areas) but rarely cover weekends or\nholidays (instead traffic in these periods is incorporated in the annualization of daily revenues to\nannual totals).\nTable 15 summarizes the forecasts for selected tolled expressways:\nTable 15: Expressways - Comparison of Forecasts and Outturn Performance\nCar Toll Traffic \u2018000 Traffic Outturn compared to\nProject\nUS cents vehicles/day growth Forecast?\nMalaysis - Singapore 18130 10,000 n/a traffic haft forecast; revenues\nSecond Crossing (incl. motorcycles) (just opened) one third forecast\nLahore \u2013 Islamabad 1.35/km 4,000 n/a Traffic half forecast; revenues\nMotorway, Pakistan less than one third forecast\nNorth-South 2.9/km up to 100,000 10% pa Correctly forecast\nExpressway, Malaysia\nThis sample of expressways is, in our experience, typical both of Asia and of other\ndeveloping countries. It demonstrates a most important fact: that forecasts are usually high and\noptimistic.\na. The Impact of an Expressway\nWhen a toll road opens, the following chain of events typically occur:\n\u2022 The toll road will parallel one or more existing roads, which appear to be congested. In\nfact, vehicle flows may be relatively low as much of the congestion may be caused by\nlow technology/low speed vehicles consuming much of the available capacity. Typically,\nexisting inter-urban roads may be carrying between 10,000\u201420,000 vehicles per day\n(vpd), with generally higher flows in urban areas. Of course, much of this traffic would\nnot use a toll road, e.g., low technology vehicles as above, motorcycles, local buses,\nmany goods vehicles.\n30 Toll levied in each direction, by the Malaysian and Singaporean authorities.", "    52\n\u2022 When the toll road opens - except in urban areas or short sections of new road -traffic\ntakes time to find the new facility; this is referred to as the \u2018ramp-up\u2019 time, which may\nextend for up to several years.\n\u2022 Tolls on opening will usually have been determined by the developer and agreed with\ngovernment; depending on the process involved and the quality of the traffic forecasting\nstudies, these may or may not be the intended optimum (in the sense of either\nmaximizing revenues or achieving social goals). However, the scope for subsequently\nadjusting tolls is usually limited: examples where unrealistically high tolls were set\ninclude both the Malaysia - Singapore Second Crossing and Lahore -Islamabad\nMotorway.\n\u2022 Cars and buses are the most willing to pay tolls for time savings, goods vehicles and\nsome taxis are the most resistant. The typical composition of toll road traffic is\noverwhelmingly cars (80 percent of traffic on Malaysia\u2019s North South Expressway, 65\npercent on the North Luzon Expressway in the Philippines, the JAGORAWI toll road in\nIndonesia, and the Lahore-lslamabad Motorway in Pakistan). As noted elsewhere, the\nPRC is different with private car traffic the exception.\n\u2022 Initially, traffic is low relative to the road capacity \u2014 typically, it may be around 10,000\nvpd relative to a capacity of 60,000 vpd for a dual-2 lane road - i.e., about 15 percent of\ncapacity; and less for a dual-3 lane road.\n\u2022 The diversion of traffic onto the toll road may come from other corridors, and in\nextreme cases may be derived from other countries (for example, the M5 motorway\nin Hungary).\n\u2022 The diversion which occurs depends in part on the impact on capacity of the existing\nroads. A poorly designed elevated expressway, for example, can reduce capacity of\nthe existing road (e.g., losing one lane in each direction to allow space for pier\nsupports).\n\u2022 Traffic growth is often rapid for two reasons: firstly, traffic starts from a low base\n(during the ramp-up period); secondly, there is a generation effect in the sense of new\ntrips being made which were not made before the toll road opened. In practice, it is\ndifficult to quantify either effect precisely, but together they can lead to significant\ngrowth \u2014 observed traffic increases following opening on some well used roads are\nas follows:\n- JAGORAWI (Indonesia) -140 percent in four years.\n- Guangzhou - Foshan (PRC) - 180 percent in three years.\n- Malaysia North South Expressway (sections open in 1989) - up to 65 percent in\ntwo years.\n\u2022 Other effects can then act to sustain the high traffic growth rates. These include:\n(i) longer-term generation effects as new developments move into the corridor as a\nresult of the improved accessibility provided by the toll road, (ii) network effects as other\nsections of the same route or of feeder routes open, and (iii) increasing congestion on\nunrelieved sections of the non-tolled alternative routes.\n\u2022 However, traffic growth is constrained by toll rate increases. These are often subject\nto  political i nterference  which  tends  to  favor  the  deferral  of  increases.  Therefore,", "    53\nwhen increases are allowed, they are then larger than originally planned. For example,\ntolls on Malaysia\u2019s North South Expressway are supposed to have increased at six\npercent per annum since 1988; in practice, tolls on cars have been increased by 50\npercent in 1993, 20 percent in 1996, 17 percent in 1997, and the six percent increase for\n1998 is currently deferred; while tolls on inter-urban roads in Indonesia have not been\nincreased between 1992 and 1997).\n\u2022 Five years after opening, toll road traffic has typically increased to two to three times the\ntraffic level on opening (i.e., typically 30,000 vpd on important inter-urban roads). Traffic\non the existing road can be back to or even higher than the pre-toll traffic level (reflecting\nthe generally increased activity in the corridor as a whole resulting from the improved\naccessibility). Thus, the total corridor traffic may have increased by a factor of around\nthree.\nb. Tariffs\nThere is considerable variation in tariffs. This variation is primarily between urban and inter-\nurban roads (with bridges/crossings as a separate highly tolled category), rather than between\ncountries.\nThe mark-up for heavy goods vehicles is around twice the car rate on well-used roads;\nhigher mark ups exist but only on roads where traffic levels are low. For buses (and taxis), Malaysia\nhas adopted a social policy which keeps tolls low - below that of cars - in order to help the mobility\nof the poorer sections of society.\nCurrent tariffs or proposed tariffs on a selection of toll roads are summarized in Table 16.\nTable 16: Tariffs on Toll Roads (US cents per vehicle)\n        Expressway Car               Small goods             Large goods                     Buses\nMalaysia: North South Expressway 2.9 4.2 5.7  1.7\nMalaysia: North South Central Link 2.9  4.2 5.7    2.2\nMalaysia\u2013Singapore: Second 18131  411 821    219\nCrossing\nPakistan: Lahore \u2013 Islamabad 1.4 2.0 3.6 - 4.5    2.9\nIndonesia: JAGORAWI 2.2 (1997)  2.2 (1997) 2.7 -3.8 (1997) 2.7\u20133.8 (1997)\n1.1 (1998)\nIndonesia: Jakarta \u2013 Tangerang 2.6 (1997)  2.6 (1997) 4.1 (1997)   4.1 (1997)\n1.3 (1998)\nIndonesia: Jakarta \u2013 Cikampek 2.4 (1997)  2.4 (1997) 4.1 - 4.9 (1997) 4.1 \u20134.9(1997)\n1.2 (1998)\nIndonesia: Jakarta Inner Ring Road 5.5 - 8.2\n(Urban)\nPhilippines: South Luzon Proposed 2.0\nExpressway Extension (Batangas)\nPhilippines Skyway (Urban) 14.5\nPRC: - typical rates 3.0 - 7.0\n31 Toll levied in each direction, by the Malaysian and Singaporean authorities.", "54\nc. Forecasting Errors\nMany traffic and revenue forecasts ignore some of the realities described above or are\nbased on key input assumptions which do not in fact occur. Typical errors include:\n\u2022 Data. The database is often constrained by budgets and time-scales so that it does\nnot include good origin-destination data or accurate traffic composition data (which\ncan be crucial to the revenue forecasts given the different toll rates by vehicle\ncategory).\n\u2022 Model specification. Models can be poorly specified, especially those which estimate\nthe willingness of drivers to pay tolls, leading to over-optimistic assumptions about\ndiversion rates to the toll road. There are technical issues concerning:\n- The best methods to establish values of time. Stated intention surveys are often\nused rather than stated or revealed preference; this can lead to serious\nmisjudgment.32\n- How these values of time are applied in the traffic model.\n- How growth in values of time should be estimated.\n\u2022 Model inputs. Simple assumptions are generally made for future traffic and\neconomic growth (these generally ignore short-term effects), interactions between\ntraffic on different roads, and macro developments elsewhere. The derivation of\nforecasts between model forecast years - often separated by 10 years or more -\ncan ignore key events such as other projects opening, which affect traffic\ndisproportionately during this period. Often, no allowance is made for traffic ramp-\nup (i.e., the time it takes traffic to discover the new route).\n\u2022 Tariff assumptions. Forecasts generally assume that tariff increases (and even\nthe initial tariffs) will occur as planned. In practice, these are often subject to\nconsiderable political interference. Sensitivity tests rarely consider this issue, but\ninstead tend to concentrate on variations in economic and traffic growth, and\ndiversion rates from existing roads.\n\u2022 Network assumptions. Governments may have a strategic plan for their highway\nnetwork, but this may not be used to determine what is implemented. Some BOT\nprojects suffer from competition from other projects which are subsequently opened\nin the same corridor. The possibility and impact of competing infrastructure is often\noverlooked.\n32 A survey of goods vehicle drivers outside the JAGORAWI corridor (south of Jakarta) identified 80 percent of drivers\nwho claimed to have used the toll road; subsequent surveys within the corridor revealed that only around 40 percent\nactually used the toll road. The impact on the project finances was far greater than this, because goods vehicles were\nassumed to pay far higher tolls than cars.", "55\n3. Key Issues\nForecasting requires understanding and segmenting the travel market into homogeneous\nsub-markets with individual behavioral characteristics. In particular, it requires an understanding of\nhow traffic responds when faced with tolls.\na. Tariffs\nOnce a toll road has opened, we are not aware of any studies to establish whether the\nappropriate (i.e., revenue or social objective maximizing) tariff levels have or have not been set.\nThere is often little provision or opportunity to change toll levels post opening, even when an\nexpressway is clearly performing badly. This may reflect some inflexibility in the concession\nagreement or by the regulatory authority, but is mainly the result of the financial imperatives that\nmust be met by the developer/operator (who is usually unprepared to reduce tolls in case even\nthe small revenues that are being collected should be lost; or the potential for future increase is\nlost). So, to the question: \u2018Could revenues be increased by setting tolls better?\u2019 there is no clear\nanswer available.\nb. Willingness-to-Pay Tolls\nThe drivers of cars and motorcycles decide whether or not the toll is worth paying. For\nbuses the decision is made by the company - and because the benefits are usually high (in terms\nof improved utilization of the bus, and the increased tariff which may be chargeable) and the costs\nlow (the toll is divided between all passengers) most inter-city buses use toll roads.\nHowever, for goods vehicles it is a more complex issue, and the use of the toll road\ndepends upon:\n\u2022 The structure of the industry. The more it comprises small owner-operated or leased\nvehicles, the less likely is the toll road to be used - because such vehicles rarely have\nback-loads, and in practice may expect to spend several days before returning to\nbase. Not surprisingly, their value of time is very low. This is common in developing\ncountries.\n\u2022 The form of payment. Some operators market tokens to large companies, which\nensures that drivers actually use the toll road (as opposed to pocketing the payment\nand avoiding it).\nThe choice in each case is between the perceived cost of the expressway and the\nexisting road. This cost may include illicit payments to police, provincial taxes, bridge or other\ntolls, as well as long journey times. Some of these \u2018unexpected\u2019 costs may be faced on\nexpressways too, negating part of their advantage.\nWhere the marginal costs of tolls is relatively unimportant (and especially if the expressway\nforms only a small part of the route but offers large time savings), operators have an opportunity to\nset high tolls. However, this needs to be a decision based on an informed understanding of the\nmarket traveling in their corridor.\nc. Integration with the Highway Network\nThere is a tendency for the expressway to be seen as an end in itself, yet the traffic it carries\nis affected very substantially by the success, or otherwise, with which it is integrated into the\nexisting road network.", "56\nFactors that are important are:\n\u2022 Junction locations and design - unless traffic can access the expressway readily, it\nmay be deterred from using it.\n\u2022 Road improvements in and near the expressway corridor. These may be outside the\ninfluence of the concessionaire, yet they can impact substantially on its traffic. This\nwas a major problem on the Don Muang Tollway in Bangkok (in which the Government\nhas now had to invest).\n\u2022 Integration faced with other competing expressways. This concerns physical integration,\nand tariff integration, and is considered below.\nA BOT road stands a better chance of success if it is part of a wider strategic network into\nwhich it is well integrated. The North South Expressway in Malaysia is a good example of a strategic\nroute of national importance; even rural sections, which are directly tied into the rest of the route,\ncarried significant traffic volumes on opening (typically at least 20,000 vpd).\nd. Marketing\nLittle marketing seems to be carried out at present, and there are few toll roads where rates\nare varied by time of day, or offer concessions for regular use, or operate widespread prepayment\ndeals. There are significant opportunities for action in these areas, even where an expressway is\nreliant on manual toll collection methods.\ne. Uncertainty and the Treatment of Risk\nImplementation and operation of an expressway in a developing country environment faces\nmany risks. There are, however, two issues which should be highlighted here:\n\u2022 It is clearly the case, that uncertainty in the revenue stream is much larger than in the\ncosts, yet it is the latter that receives the main attention.\n\u2022 There is surprisingly little attention given to comprehensive risk assessment.\nGovernment should be very concerned, but largely ignores risk (save to ensure that excess\nprofits are not made). Developers are usually contractors, concerned primarily with construction\nrisks rather than other downstream uncertainties (which they do not expect to face, having exited\nthe project after opening). While lenders are usually33 concerned with the downside risks, but\nthey often examine these issues late in the planning process, by which time developers and\ngovernments have become committed to the scheme and the project has developed an\nunstoppable momentum of its own. Lenders (and their advisers) are usually under considerable\npressure not to halt progress or kill the project at the eleventh hour.\nIn summary, it is the case that only rarely are project risks addressed comprehensively and\nearly enough to influence the project specification, staging, etc.\n33   \nExcept where they are underwritten by government, as in Malaysia, where they have - until the current crisis - been little\ninterested in risk.", "57\n4. Toll Revenues\na. Objectives\nTypically 95 percent of the revenues from a toll road result from tolls; with the remaining\nfive percent from advertising and small concessions; so securing the revenue from traffic using\na toll road is of critical importance. It is interesting that it is the banks who often seem more\ninterested in this than the concessionaires.\nThe purpose of tolling is to maximize net revenues (revenues less the costs of tolling). The\nfactors involved are:\n\u2022 Maximizing the quality of service offered to customers (avoiding frequent stops for\npayment at one extreme, and any stops at the other, while simultaneously making\npayment easy. This maximizes traffic and the willingness-to-pay of users.\n\u2022 For companies owning trucks/vans, their objective is to ensure that the payments they\nmake, result in their vehicles actually using the toll road (i.e., that the driver does not\npocket the toll). Some tolling systems can guarantee this \u2014 which is strongly to the\nadvantage of the concessionaire too.\n\u2022 The need for land-take (for tollbooths) and the capital and operating costs of tolling\nsystems need careful assessment.\nb. Tolling Systems\nThese are categorized as:\n\u2022 Open, closed or hybrid (the latter being part open, part closed). Generally, open toll\nsystems are used in urban or semi-urban areas where traffic flows are high and there\nare numerous entry/exit points along the toll road which it is difficult/costly to control;\nwhile closed systems tend to be used on inter-urban roads with limited access. But\nthese are not hard and fast rules.\n\u2022 Closed systems ensure that all toll road users are charged a toll directly related to\ntheir usage of the toll road. Open systems do not charge all users (only those passing\nthrough the tollgates) and the charge is the same irrespective of journey length; as\nsuch they do not collect all the potential revenues. However, their operating costs are\nlower and there are fewer delays to traffic.\n\u2022 A well-designed open system can achieve most of the revenues of a closed system,\nbut there will inevitably be some leakage. This needs to be minimized by careful design\nand analysis of trip patterns and route choices.\n\u2022 Single lane/manual collection, or electronic or mixed - where regular users have tags\nand are required to slow down only at the toll gates (to 10kph-15kph). There are more\nthat one hundred such systems worldwide.\n\u2022 Free flow multi-lane all electronic.\nToday in Asia, all systems are relatively simple, usually requiring drivers to stop for payment\nat toll-gates, but with several examples of exclusive lanes for regular users with tags, for example,\nin Hong Kong, China; Malaysia; and Bangkok.", "58\nc. Electronic Systems\nThe key aspects of these advanced systems are as follows:\n\u2022 The technology: this is now proven, but not perfect, even for complex multi-lane solutions.\n\u2022 A EU/international (CEN/ISO) standard exists for the vehicle to roadside communications,\nsupported by competing manufacturers (in use in Austria, Australia, etc., but not yet\nimplemented in the US).\n\u2022 Devising strategies which both provide support for irregular users, and enforce penalties\nagainst people who do not intend to pay.\nThe technology typically comprises:\n\u2022 A tag in the center of the vehicle windscreen, conforming to the EU standard, is the\nsimplest method, and is no more than an identification card. An in-vehicle smart card\nsystem complicates the design (due to more sophisticated strategies which are required\nto reliably enforce payment violations).\n\u2022 Tag-to-overhead beacon communications, now reliable (provided the tags are working\nand fitted properly \u2014 making fitting every vehicle highly desirable.\n\u2022 Overhead equipment which detects a vehicle, captures the registration number (by\ntaking an electronic image of the number plate), and classifies the vehicle by length/\nheight/width.\n\u2022 Roadside computers linked to a central computer/database which results in any of the\nfollowing courses of action:\n- Notifies the central computer of a \u2018successful\u2019 payment using the tag.\n- Notifies the central computer of a \u2018successful\u2019 payment from an irregular user (no\ntag).\n- Identifies no pay where the tag is not functioning (for follow up).\n- Identifies no pay where there is a willingness to evade.\n- Organizes billing.\nThe key to the enforcement of non-payers is an understanding of the customer-base -\nhence an ability to separate deliberate avoiders (multiple offenders) from good customers with\noccasional problems (maybe due to tag failure). The technology allows reliable classification into\nthree categories:\n\u2022 Those who pay - success.\n\u2022 Those who do not - probably because the tag is badly installed (occasional defaulter).\n\u2022 Those who choose not to pay (repeated defaulters).", "    59\nA large penalty is required for offenders.\nEnforcement depends upon having accurate records of car owners\u2019 addresses. If these\ndon\u2019t exist, then electronic systems (such as speed/red light camera enforcement) will not work.\nd. Regulatory/Legal Requirements\nThe key bodies involved are the concessionaire, the state legal authorities (police, courts),\nand the road authority.\nIf a law is passed (as in Singapore) requiring a car to have a tag, then enforcement is\nrelatively straightforward (it is an offense not to have a tag, and as such the technical problems of\ndealing with valid unequipped users is avoided). Moreover, the tag can incorporate the vehicle tax,\nallowing tax evaders to be simply traced. But this is the exception at present.\nAny toll road needs regulations to exist. Legislation is required to cover the following\nissues:\n\u2022 Collect tolls.\n\u2022 Sign the toll road, from the existing roads.\n\u2022 Control advertising along the toll road.\n\u2022 Define operational procedures - access for emergency vehicles (who is responsible for\nwhat?).\n\u2022 Issues of privacy: whether an electronic photograph of a number-plate will be accepted\nby courts; defining the approval process for such equipment, or defining what information\ncan be disclosed to whom under what circumstances.\n\u2022 Defining the right to enforce for non-payment, with penalties that make violation\nunattractive (who is the enforcing agency, is it a civil or criminal offense). Non-renewal\nof annual vehicle licenses for outstanding penalties is one option.\ne. Inter-operability\nHow can systems work in a network which comprises different concessionaires? The answer\nis likely to be that:\n\u2022 All systems should use the same EU standard tag. This can be used to bill different\nconcessionaires, with different accounts. This is the most likely scenario (usually, as in\nFrance and Germany, there is a single dominant operator).\n\u2022 Alternatively and additionally, adopt single billing for the convenience of customers.\nThis requires a clearing house with revenues allocated on the basis of clear\nguidelines. No such system is known to exist, although Malaysia/Klang Valley is\nlooking at such a system.", "60\nf. Costs\nAn example: Melbourne CityLink - the costs for one project, which is pioneering the effective use\nof electronic technology are as follows:\n\u2022 Construction cost for the expressway are US$0.8 billion excluding financing, and US$1.1\nbillion including financing.\n\u2022 Contract for all electronic tolling equipment: US$40 million. The technology therefore costs\nabout five percent - six percent of the cost.\n\u2022 Tags cost about US$30 each. The concessionaire pays for them (600,000 in total34) -\nthey are given to customers when they open their account.\nFor a more typical project the electronic tolling system might cost say four percent of total cost\n(Melbourne has costly tunnels).\ng. Applicability of Tolling Systems to Developing Country Environments\nExperience may be simply summarized as follows:\n\u2022 Existing practices are often primitive - there is little doubt that electronic techniques will\nincreasingly be applied.\n\u2022 Electronic systems have great potential to maximize revenues: by providing an attractive\nlevel of service on the expressway, and a convenient payment system by providing\nflexibility to change tariffs - by time of day (peaking) or over time; and by securing trucking\nrevenues etc.\n\u2022 The tolling strategy has to be carefully designed (there are many subtle pitfalls).\n\u2022 Tolling always requires legislative/regulatory requirements which must be enacted in law.\n\u2022 Electronic systems require information about vehicle owners\u2019 addresses, for enforcement.\nWhere this is insufficient, or enforcement is likely to be poor, manual systems are still\nnecessary.\n\u2022 Inter-operability is relatively easy to provide with electronic systems - by requiring use of\nEU standard tags. For manual systems it is not - repeated stopping is probably necessary\n(unless a clearing house can be set up \u2014 which is unlikely in most commercial\nenvironments).\n \n34  1 million customers, 700 thousand transactions per day.", "61\n5. Non-Toll Revenues\nMany assume that there are other sources of funds that the private sector can capture, other\nthan tolls from motorists, but this is only rarely so. Typically, five percent of gross revenues come from\nother sources - primarily advertising and concessions.\nProperty profits are usually held out as the great hope, on the grounds that the expressway itself\nincreases land values near interchanges, and results in development gain. This is often so, but the\nproblems in capturing it are substantial.\n\u2022 The first problem is that the profits are unpredictable (all property markets typically exhibit\nboom-and-bust cycles). If property gain underpins the project finances, it follows that the\ntiming of the project is determined by the property cycle - which does not fit with the\nrequirements of government\u2019s procurement processes.\n\u2022 Secondly, land deals are not always straightforward and it is sometimes difficult (e.g., in\nPRC) to know who owns the land and what is happening. This makes it risky to depend\non such deals.\n\u2022 For these reasons, banks are usually unwilling to accept such forecasts of property profits\nas a component of a funding package, instead they assume they are zero.\nC. Sector Policies\n1. Policy Overview\na. The Need for a Change in Direction\nTransport infrastructure provides essential access to jobs, education and health facilities\nand is crucial to economic activity. It is necessary for development. Changing economic\ncircumstances and social aspirations are changing the way we use transport infrastructure and\nhow we need to plan its development. Sustainability in economic, financial, environmental and\nsocial terms is now high on the agenda, and these re-defined objectives underpin a new approach\nto the provision of transport infrastructure. The traditional approach of provision by the public\nsector is disappearing. It is being replaced by an increasing involvement of the private sector,\nto achieve a more responsive transport sector, which, crucially, has to be given the right\nsignals to respond to.\nThere are compelling economic and financial35 reasons to involve the private sector in the\nfunding and operation of the roads sector.\nThe traditional approach to the provision of transport infrastructure and services has\nbeen based on detailed government intervention. Infrastructure has normally been provided\ndirectly by the state and the state has either directly provided transport services or heavily\n35 This section distinguishes between \u2018economic\u2019 and \u2018financial\u2019 impacts. The former includes all of the project impacts\n(both those which are costs and revenues, and all others); while financial impacts include only the costs and\nrevenues.", "62\nregulated privately provided services, usually controlling entry to the market, product characteristics,\nprice levels and maximum profit rates.\nThe critical weakness of this traditional approach is clearly shown in the World Bank\npublication Sustainable Transport: Policies for Reform, 1996. It is the absence of incentives to\nensure that infrastructure and services provided are in tune with market requirements, the public\ninterest. The absence of competition leads to excess, monopoly profits, inefficiency in provision,\nand failure to respond to the needs of the market. The report explicitly defines government\u2019s central\nrole succinctly: \u2018The basis for increasing economic sustainability in transport is to create a\ncompetitive, market-based transport sector\u2019.\nFor this objective to be fulfilled with regard to the roads sector, the private sector has to be\ninvolved in their provision within a regulatory framework that delivers the effects of competition.\nIdeally, prices would be set at levels which send effective signals to transport system users and\nthose making investment decisions.\nHowever, experience of PSP to date has raised many issues. ADB is particularly concerned\nthat, in some instances, corruption has distorted the impacts of the policy, and that social and\nenvironmental consequences have not been addressed.\nb. Strategy for Attracting PSP\nFigure 1 summarizes the strategy that needs to be followed if PSP in funding transport\ninfrastructure is to be effective. Its key features are:\n\u2022 The objective (to the right of the figure) is to provide improved services to passengers\nand operators that are available and reliable, that offer choice and that are competitively\npriced.\n\u2022 Political will is the essential starting point. Investors and lenders need to be sure that\ngovernments are committed to PSP, and to the private sector collecting tolls and\nrepatriating debt service costs and returns on investment.\n\u2022 An institutional framework which offers the private sector a level playing field is required.\nThe public and private sector must operate on the same basis: an independent\nregulatory body and framework is now required (the same body cannot be both\nprovider/operator and regulator).\n\u2022 The right regulatory and pricing policies are needed, to create competitive markets.\nMarket access must be guaranteed, monopoly practices controlled and safety\nstandards enforced. Freedom in tariff setting is required to ensure that - as far as\npossible - users pay the full costs to society of their use of infrastructure and\nservices. Where tariffs are kept low and are supported, the existence of the\ngovernment support has to be identified and governments forced to decide whether\nthe support should continue.\nSuch a framework will send the right signals to investors and lenders, encouraging their\ninvolvement in funding, building and operating transport projects. All of the components of the\nstrategy need to be in place: the absence of any will discourage involvement, no matter how attractive\nthe projects may be.", "Figure 1:       Philippines - Strategy for Attracting PSP\n-   Finance\nPRIVATE SECTOR\n-   Entrepreneurial Skills\nt\nt t\nPOLITICAL SERVICE\nWILL POLICY OPERATIONS\nt t\nInstitutional Transport\nt\nRestructing Strategy 6\n-  Availability 3\nFUNDING\nRegulatory\n(Clarity Governemnt Policy -  Price\nfunction:\nof   \u2022  purchaser BOT -  Choice\nPurpose) Tariff\nt   \u2022  facilitator t Liberalisation t Other user t PROJECTS t -  Quality\ncharge\nBOT\nIndependent\nRegulation Concessions Government\nPolicy budget", "    64\nc. Preventing Corruption\nThere is understandable concern that in some cases, the private-sector approach has led to\ncorruption and nepotism, which has seriously undermined the approach. This was based on the\nassumption by private groups that even in a chaotic environment, they could make money from such\nconcessions.\nHowever, the experience is that in practice very few have made money out of such\nprojects, and there is a growing recognition that the current PSP process in most countries\nserves no-one\u2019s interests.\nMoreover, the current economic crisis has reinforced government\u2019s commitment to make\nthe procurement and regulatory processes more truly competitive and transparent. Change has\nbeen forced by the need to attract private finance, and the international competition for such\nfinance.\nThe agenda for the future is to translate these objectives into effective action, in the\nknowledge that there is a growing constituency of support in both the public and private sectors\nfor such changes.\nd. Funding the Transport Sector\nThe principles of public sector pricing and taxation have been difficult to implement in\nthe transport sector in most developing countries. In addition, it has been difficult to charge\nroad users at the point-of-use for use of the road network. Because of this difficulty, the sector\nremains under-funded, having to rely on a share of general public funds rather than generating\nits own funds. Moreover, road funds are not secure; they are typically raided by governments\nwith many demands and constrained resources. The result is no security in funding even for\nmaintaining the basic road assets, and frequent disinvestment - where costs incurred to\nrehabilitate the road structure and pavement are many times those that good maintenance\nwould have required.\nEconomic efficiency is served by setting prices equal to the full cost of an activity. In the case of\nthe use of expressways, prices should cover:\n\u2022 The road user\u2019s own costs of vehicle operation.\n\u2022 The marginal costs imposed on the provider of the expressway, particularly damage to the\ncarriageway.\n\u2022 External costs, particularly in terms of congestion costs (delays and additional vehicle\noperating costs) and environmental costs.\nIn the absence of a mechanism for imposing direct charges for road use, the most\nappropriate way of approximating these costs is by incorporating them in fuel prices (see the\naforementioned World Bank Publication entitled Sustainable Transport). Fuel prices should be\nset to cover:\n\u2022 Its resource cost - normally the import (or export) price.\n\u2022 Its environmental impact, mainly its impact upon air pollution (including global\nwarming).\n\u2022 The proxy road-user charge - which should reflect the cost of using the infrastructure.", "65\nFigure 2:      Fuel Price in Different Countries (Premium Gasoline\nPUMP PRICES FOR PREMIUM GASOLINE\nDeveloping Industrial\n5.25\neconomies economies\nJapan\n5.00\n4.75\n4.50 Norway\nNetherlands\n4.25\nSweden\nItaly\n4.00\nFrance, Hong Kong\nBelgium\n3.75 Western European average ($3.69)\nPortugal\n3.50\nUnited Kingdom\nAustriaIreland\n3.25 Finland, Luxembourg, Greece\nUruguay\nBarbado\nSuriname Spain\n3.00\nRepublic of Korea\nCroatia\nArgentina\nHungary 2.75\nSingapor\nNicaragua\n2.50\nPero, Bolivia\nTaipei, China 2.25\nIsrael\nAntigua New Zealand\nPoland, El Salvador 2.00\nDeveloping country average ($1.87)\nParaguay Australia\nChile 1.75\nGrenada Canada\nPanama Ghana\nMalaysia, Trinidad 1.50\nGuatemala Honduras\nPhilippines, Ecuador\nIndonesia, Benin United State\nCosta Rica, Vietman 1.25\nColombiaMozambique Puerto Rico\nThailand\nPRC 1.00\n0.75\nRussia 0.50\n0.25\nVenezuela 0.00\nSource: Energy Detente (1994); World Bank.", "66\nFigure 2 demonstrates that fuel prices in most Asian countries are substantially below\n(only one third of) the average in industrial economies. The World Bank estimate that European\nprices are likely to be a more appropriate benchmark for developing Countries than the very low\nprices found in US \u2014 if this is the principal mechanism of recouping the costs imposed on\nsociety by road transport.\nA critical first step is, therefore, to increase fuel prices so that they better represent the\nfull costs of fuel use. At a stroke, this would provide a more efficient use of resources in the\ntransport sector, and generate funds, the user-charge component of which should be dedicated\nto the roads sector. This is necessary, because there is no other available option, and without it\nthe road sector in developing countries will remain seriously under-funded, and there will be no\nincentives to drivers in using their cars (the reason why congestion is widespread today).\nA combination of fuel prices set in this way, and direct charges for the additional benefits\noffered by high-quality facilities such as many expressways, represents an appropriate development\nof transport sector pricing policies.\n2. Appraisal of Expressways\na. Objectives\nTable 11 summarized the objectives of expressways under four criteria: economic\nefficiency, development, social, and environment. The case studies demonstrated that while\neconomic efficiency was always central to proposals, and development sometimes (in Malaysia\nand Hong Kong, China), social objectives were addressed only in Malaysia and environmental\nimpacts were little mentioned.\nMany arguments are put forward in support of expressways, they are usually considered\nto be the obvious response to serious traffic congestion. The fact of this problem is obvious, and\nthe prospect of it becoming more serious is equally obvious. But the following questions are\nrarely asked, before drawing the conclusion that expressways are the right answer:\n\u2022 Do expressways solve traffic congestion problems? It is often assumed that this is\nso, yet particularly in big cities - in Bangkok, Tokyo, or Seoul, all of which have large\nexpressway networks, it is clear that (alone) they do not. The answer may be \u2018yes\u2019,\nparticularly in inter-urban corridors, but it is not self-evidently so. Sometimes an\nexpressway is clearly the wrong response.\n\u2022 What other impacts do expressways have? Do they promote a sustainable form of\ndevelopment, are they environmentally sustainable? The answer depends upon\ncircumstance, but some projects clearly distort strategy.\n\u2022 Is an expressway affordable (if it is not, it cannot be implemented, however bad the\nproblem). This question is rarely asked \u2014 instead, expressways are assumed to be\nprofitable, and therefore free to the public sector. But unfortunately this is only rarely\nso.\nIt may be asked what is the alternative? The conclusion throughout the world is that the\nanswer to the pervasive problems created by traffic congestion requires a combination of\nmanagement policies for the existing network, improved public transport in urban areas, and", "67\nnew road construction which targets identified problems and helps structure land development. In\nshort, expressways have their place, but particularly in urban areas, this needs to be part of a\nbalanced transport strategy.\nIt may also be asked what role exists for the private sector, if expressways are not\nappropriate. The answer is increasingly recognized to be very substantial. For example, it may\nwell be that in the medium-term, the management of the whole main road system is concessioned\nout to private sector operating companies, creating a major new business opportunity for the\nprivate sector. The focus of such concessions will increasingly be on the management of existing\nassets, rather than creating new capacity.\nb. The Nature of Expressways\nThis report defines expressways as controlled-access roads, from which a revenue stream\nmay be secured, by tolling or through shadow-tolls. Expressways are what economists refer to as\n\u2018semi-private goods\u2019, and this has important implications.\nSimply,36 private goods can be produced by either the private or the public sector; and public\ngoods can be produced by the public sector, or by the private sector in many cases.\nA private good is one supplied in a form that involves:\n\u2022 Excludability \u2013 supply is provided for particular customers (there are no free-riders).\n\u2022 Subtractability \u2013 supply to one customer reduces supply to other customers.\nThus, power and water delivered to a house, office or factory is excludable and, at a given\ncapacity, subtractable.\nRoads are generally public goods, being both non-excludable and non-subtractable. But\nthey can be converted into private goods through regulation and charging \u2013 as long as the costs of\ndoing this (the transaction costs) are not too high. In practice, the costs of contracting, charging,\nand enforcement would be far too high for the road network as a whole, and many of the economic\nbenefits would be lost.\nBut some roads can be made semi-private through controlling their access. Some of their\npotential customers (non-motorized etc.) are excluded, but they are not fully subtractable - their\nuse by one authorized user does not prevent use by others. Access-controlled roads generally\nprovide a high level of service, for which users are willing, and should, pay.\nc. Financing Expressways\nControlled access roads provide a better service, and beneficiaries should pay. When the\nbeneficiaries are also tolled, there is some loss of benefits. The contracting, tolling and enforcement\ncosts of tolling should be reduced as far as possible to reduce this loss in benefits.\n36 We refer here to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.", "68\nThe semi-private characteristic of expressways provides one argument for some public funding.\nThe other is that the roads generate benefits for people on the existing roads (who do not pay towards\nthe cost of the expressway) through de-congestion, etc., and government should be prepared to pay to\nsecure these benefits.37\nd. Profitability\nAn expressway is defined in this report as \u2018profitable\u2019 if the (almost entirely toll) revenues\ncan finance the full cost of implementation (project development, land acquisition and construction),\ntogether with operating and asset replacement costs \u2014 and provide an acceptable return to\nshareholders.\nAt first glance, it would \u2014 contrary to the widely-held view \u2014 be surprising if expressways\nwere profitable. Because expressways benefit two categories of people:\n\u2022 Those who use them - and pay towards their cost.\n\u2022 Those who do not use them, and instead travel along the de-congested parallel free road,\nand do not pay towards their cost.\nThe economic evaluation captures both these categories of benefit, but the financial evaluation\nonly the former.\nThe evidence summarized in this report is compelling. Throughout the world, not only in\ndeveloping countries, very few expressways are profitable given this definition. In the four case study\ncountries, it is estimated that between three and five projects may be profitable (defined as above),\nout of a large number.\ne. The PRC is Different\nAs described in Appendix 2, only the PRC is different, for understandable reasons.\nHere, costs are kept extremely low (the roads in question are inter-urban, and are constructed,\noperated and maintained using local inputs), the existing \u2018 alternativ \u2019 routes are very poor and\ncongested, traffic growth is rapid, and for many journeys the toll is only a small part of the total\nperceived cost of the journey.\nThe firm conclusion for everywhere other than the PRC is that expressways require\ngovernment support/investment in order to create profitability for PSP. This may be in the form\nof an existing road asset, which is handed \u2018free\u2019 to the private concessionaire. Or it may be in\nthe form of government guarantees, which \u2014 if they are called (because, for example, expected\ntraffic has not materialized) then requires actual government investment.\n \n37  Arguably otherwise government would have to invest in alternative projects to secure the benefits.", "69\nf. The Impact of Country Income on Profitability\nThere is a prima facie reason to expect that profitability will increase with incomes.\nThis is because while revenues should increase at least proportionately (as willingness-to-pay\nincreases proportionately, as traffic growth increases at least proportionately, and as congestion\non the free alternative route rapidly increases), costs should not increase. Their labor component\ncost will increase, but materials and energy costs are traded commodities, and should not.\nTypically, construction costs are estimated to rise at about one-third to one-half of the increase\nin income. The result is illustrated in Figure 3. There is one caveat - expressways in big cities\ncan incur very high land costs - up to one-half of their cost when on a new alignment, but this\nis not the norm.\nThe implications are important:\n\u2022 As incomes increase, expressways become more affordable to both their users and to\ngovernment.\n\u2022 Conversely, they are unlikely to be feasible where incomes are low.\ng. The Implications of Non-Profitability\nThe implications should be obvious, but are not always appreciated. They are that:\n\u2022 BOT expressways are costly - typical costs are in the range US$0.25 billion-US$1 .0\nbillion.\n\u2022 They mobilize large private funds, but only at the cost of large public funds - a government\ninvestment requirement of US$0.1 billion - 0.4 billion in just one project is not unusual.\n\u2022 Public funds are scarce - the annual public sector budget for the whole transport sector\n(roads, ports, airports, and rail) in the whole of the Philippines is currently just US$1\nbillion.\nThere is, therefore, a concern that BOT projects will inadvertently (because projects are\nwidely thought to be profitable) pre-empt resources - maybe on a massive scale - which should\ninstead be invested in:\n\u2022 Other higher-priority investments in the same city or inter-urban corridor (traffic\nmanagement, secondary roads, developmental roads, bus facilities etc.).\n\u2022 Other disadvantaged areas. BOT projects are always concentrated where the traffic flows\nare high. This is usually in the capital city, or for the radial roads leading to it. Government\nusually has development objectives for other regions and provinces, for which it requires\nfunds. If these are pre-empted by investment in so-called private roads elsewhere then\nplans can be undermined.\nThere is a further issue, which arises particularly in big cities - where many of Asia\u2019s BOT\nprojects have been built. Land costs can become a very important component of expressway\ncosts, which naturally leads to low-cost corridors being used. These are almost always existing\nmajor  arteries,  and  the  expressway  reinforces  the  existing  concentration  along  a  few  big", "    70\ncorridors. This would be fine if government was developing other arteries, necessary to open up land\nfor efficient development. But this rarely happens, and one reason is that public funds are\nconcentrated in supporting BOT projects.\nTherefore, a central message for planners is that the public component of BOT projects\nneeds to be evaluated against the other competing priorities before committing to such projects. BOT\nprojects will not always be a rational use of government resources.\nTherefore, private funding should be considered additional to public funding. But in practice it\ncan only be so when economic analysis determines that the project has a high priority, and that the\npublic investment required can be rationally justified against competing priorities.\nFigure 3: ToIl Road Finances and Income\nCountry\nIncome\nLevel\n\u201cProfitable\u201d\nProjects\nCost\n\u201cProfitable\u201d\nProjects\nRequirement for\nGovernment Support\nR e v e n u e s\nExpressway cost and revenues", "71\nh. Role and Scope of the Economic Evaluation\nThe public sector has an obligation to ensure that the development of the nation\u2019s\ninfrastructure, including its road network, fulfills economic, financial, environmental, and social\nsustainability criteria. The economic appraisal of projects is a crucial public sector responsibility.\nAppropriate valuation of impacts should include social factors (e.g., the distributional impacts of a\nscheme) and some environmental impacts (others are incorporated outside it) - factors with which\nthe private sector will have no concern.\nThe public sector should ensure that any proposed concession is an important and\nworthwhile use of funds. It should estimate EIRR and net present value (NPV) of the project not just\nto ensure that these are acceptable but also to ensure:\n\u2022 That in a financially constrained environment, the project\u2019s NPV per unit of capital cost\nranks it sufficiently highly to warrant the use of public funds.\n\u2022 That the project as it will be implemented, with an appropriate toll structure, generates\nan appropriate EIRR or NPV.\nIt is not acceptable that the project solely exceeds government\u2019s test discount rate (typically\n10\u201312 percent in developing countries) \u2014 because far more projects exceed this threshold than\nthe public funds allow to be implemented (i.e., it is solely a threshold, which ensures that projects\nare not bad). Neither should the public sector accept projects that are financially viable; rather, it\nshould satisfy itself that the project is a priority in its strategic plans, and does not have unforeseen\nconsequences. Here the economic evaluation is essential.\nIt will be clear from the above that the economic and financial assessments will not give the\nsame answers (in terms of their NPV or IRR) and are likely to be in conflict. The economic\nassessment has a wider focus and more detailed measurement than a financial assessment,\nwhich is narrow and crude by comparison. Figure 4 highlights the principal economic benefits\nwhich are excluded from, or will be under-represented in, a financial appraisal; and it shows that\nnot all of the economic benefits are capable of being captured via tolls.\ni. Implications of Government Investment\nThe semi-private characteristics of expressways and the existence of economic benefits\nthat cannot be captured in toll revenues provides the rationale for public sector investment. It is,\ngiven the caveats above, right for government to want to invest in PSP expressways to secure\nthe decongestion benefits for non-users of the expressway (and also other non-capturable\nbenefits).\nMany expressways should therefore be implemented under reverse-tender BOT\ncontracts: e.g., the private sector bids at defined tolls to minimize the government investment.\nThis is a most important conclusion, for it applies to most expressways (i.e., those that are not\nfinancially viable). Yet the case studies suggest that no government in Asia invites bids on this\nbasis. Instead, bids are invited in the expectation that projects will be profitable, and when they\nare not, then either government support is committed (often in the form of contingent guarantees\nthat do not become a liability for many years), or the project is delayed, or occasionally that it is\nabandoned.", "Figure 4:  Expressway Economic and Financial Characeristic\nEconomic Evaluation Financial Evaluation\nBENEFIT REVENUES\nUser Benefits \u2022 Tolls recovered only from expressway users\n\u2022 Time savings to all road network users valued:\nboth expressway users (who pay tolls) and users\nof the existing decongested roads (who do not)\n\u2022 Individual estimate of time savings for each zone to zone movement \u2022 Toll collection systems unable to differentiate different zone to zone\n\u2022 Each fraction of a minute saved is valued movements, except coarsely, using distance as a proxy\n\u2022 Separate values of time savings by vehicle type and trip pupose \u2022 Toll collection systems unable to extract different tolls by purpose\n\u2022 Values of time assumed to grow through time in line with GDP/head \u2022 Tolls often allowed to grow only in line with inflation\nas well as inflation\n\u2022 Vehicle operating cost saving fully estimated and valued \u2022 Can only be recovered coarsely through tolls\n7\nExternal Benefits \u2022 No mechanism for their recovery 2\n\u2022 Environmental benefits\n\u2022 Accidental benefits\nRevenue\nBenefit maximum\nrevenue\nToll Toll\nrevenue\nmaximising\ntolls", "   73\nj. Impact of the PSP Environment\nTraditionally, economic analysis was used to determine what should be implemented,\nand that was the end of economic analysis: implementation was assumed to be a neutral\nprocess. But the PSP environment has both highlighted that this is not the case, and focused\nattention on the huge importance of the implementation process in determining actual project\nimpacts.\nIt is not unusual for projects to be approved on the basis of one set of assumptions,\nonly to find that what happens is very different. In the case of PSP, this is critical. If the project\ntolls are very different from those assumed, if the roads accessing the expressway are not\nimproved or if the construction cost and time are optimistic, then the decisions of both government\nand concessionaire will have been wrong, and conflict between the parties will be the result.\nThe decision-point for PSP projects needs to be made later, and on the basis of far\nmore information than has traditionally been the case. Government should make its commitment\non the basis of a business case, and central to this should be optimization of the project \u2014\nconfirming that it meets both economic and financial appraisal criteria.\nThese two appraisals should be seen as two-sides of the same coin. For example,\ngovernment should be presented with choices such as the following, in order to decide the\nbest trade-off between economic and financial performance:\nToll level Economic IRR Government Contribution\nUS$ million\n1 20% 400\n2 15% 300\n3 10% 100\nIn this illustration, the medium toll level may be the most acceptable compromise - that is,\ngovernment would wish to invest an extra US$100 million, relative to the low-toll level, in order to secure\na much improved economic performance.\n3. Competition and Regulation\nThere is evidence that corruption and nepotism occur where this is absent, resulting in services\nwhich may not satisfy government objectives.\nToll roads are normally introduced into an existing free road network. Existing free roads will\ncarry traffic to and from the toll road and may compete with it. In some countries it is a statutory\nrequirement that there has to be a free road available as an alternative to a tolled road. There may\nbe strong modal alternatives to tolled roads: rail for passenger or freight movements, air for passenger\nmovements, and shipping for freight movements.\na. Ensuring a Competitive Market\nA competitive environment is necessary to ensure that appropriate investment and pricing\npolicies are followed and that services are provided efficiently and are responsive to\nmarket  demand.  Competition  can  be  provided  for  a  market,  and  within  a  market.", "74\nCompetition for the market - retaining public regulation of the right to supply transport is desirable\nin circumstances when:\n\u2022 Duplication of services is wasteful or impractical, indicating a natural monopoly.\n\u2022 A lack of regulation leads to the duplication of schedules, potential excess capacity, pressure\nto engage in dangerous practices, or a loss in the stability or reliability of services.\n\u2022 Social objectives require direct financing or support to be provided. Competitive bidding\nis then required to ensure that services are provided at the lowest support.\nCompetition for the market for transport infrastructure is primarily achieved through the\ncompetitive award of long-term concessions. This competitive process introduces market forces\ninto the provision and management of infrastructure with the objective of stimulating efficiency by\ntransferring risk to the private sector.\nCompetition in a market, free from barriers to entry, is appropriate when the market size\nis large relative to the efficient scale of operation of services within the market. A number of\noperators can then provide efficient services in competition with one another. Alternatively, if the\nefficient scale of operation is large relative to market size, competition in the market may still be\nachieved if there is strong competition between modes or, for international movements, if there\nis strong international competition.\nThe characteristics of expressways therefore require both competition for, and in, the\nmarket.\nb. Requirements for Regulation in the Market\nThere is a need for the independent regulation of the activities of transport sector\nproviders and operators, including the government, if PSP is to be encouraged. Regulation\nhas to create a level playing field. The principal requirements for regulation in the context of\nexpressways are:\n\u2022 The Provision of Alternative Routes. For some transport services, a regulatory environment\nthat permits the free entry of competing operators is required. For expressways, for which\ndemand is normally unlikely to be sufficient to support competing routes, a regulatory\nframework which restricts the government provision of, or government support for alternative\nroutes is likely to be required. Concessionaires and their lenders will want to be assured that\ngovernment will not promote competing routes and that compensation will be payable in\nrespect of government policies that discriminate against private concessions. Had this\nprovision existed, the combined expressway/rail Hopewell project in Thailand may not have\nfailed.\n\u2022 Tariffs. Allowing a monopoly expressway operator to specify tolls will result in a\nmonopoly profit that maximizes the price charged to the user. A regulatory framework\nthat controls toll levels, toll structures, and mechanisms for increasing tolls through\ntime is required.\n\u2022 Technical Standards. Government will wish to control the standards to which roads\nare designed and constructed, to ensure they comply with safety requirements, the\nrequirements for transport services, and that they can be integrated effectively with", "75\nother expressways and roads. For example, if government determines that buses\nshould use expressways at low tariffs - to assist low-income travelers, then the\nexpressway has to be designed for bus stopping-places, and convenient access at\njunctions.\n\u2022 Profits. In order to prevent monopoly profits, the regulatory framework might specify\nmaximum profits, but at the risk of stifling the entrepreneurial activity of a\nconcessionaire. However, if as usual, the public sector is involved in funding a project\njointly with the private sector, then a profit-sharing mechanism would need to be agreed.\nThis paradoxically helps both parties - because it is embarrassing for government\nwhen projects are known to be too profitable: Was the contract let fairly? Why was\nthis not foreseen? etc.\n4. Costs, Tariffs, and Integration\na. Costs\nThe costs of constructing expressways have been reviewed on the basis of the case study and\nother evidence, from Asia and elsewhere. They are (with the exception of PRC, as previously noted)\nhigh, and typically as follows:\n  Expressway                                 Cost per kilometer\n                                           USS million\nRange Typical\nUrban 15-50 25\nInter-urban 3-10 5\nThus a 15-kilometer expressway will typically cost US$400 million if urban, and US$75\nmillion if inter-urban.\nOperating costs comprise: operation of tolling stations, traffic management, facilities\nmanagement, maybe policing, routine maintenance and resurfacing/rehabilitation/\nreconstruction as necessary. These costs are, relative to the initial costs, not high. They\nmay amount to 15 percent of the annual gross revenues.\nb. Tariffs\nEconomic efficiency requires beneficiaries to meet the marginal economic costs of the\nservice, where marginal includes the capital cost of new roads. This would lead to:\n\u2022 Tariffs by vehicle type, depending on their contribution to pavement deterioration\nand congestion (if traffic levels approached the expressway capacity, tolls would\nincrease).\n\u2022 Tariffs targeting the poor, and adjusted for pollution - if these are important\ngovernment objective. This could translate to low tariffs for buses (assuming first that\nthe bus market is competitive).", "76\nConcessionaires attempt to base tariffs on: the financing imperatives \u2013 of early payback,\ngiven the willingness-to-pay of users. One might think that they would be motivated to maximize\ntraffic (and thereby also serve economic objectives), but this is not always so. Rather, they seek to\nmaximize net revenue, which can mean excluding trucks by design, and certainly targeting the higher-\nincome users.\nThe normal practice in determining expressway tariffs is as follows:\n\u2022 The preferred bidder will play the key role in setting tolls at levels he believes to be revenue-\nmaximizing, i.e., in pursuit of financial objectives.\n\u2022 Tolls tend to follow international experience with a toll rate for cars of US$0.05 \u2014\nUS$0.1 per km and higher tolls for trucks.\n\u2022 The largest trucks with 4+ axles and buses, tend to pay a toll of three to four times the\ncar toll.\n\u2022 Tolls are set at revenue-maximizing levels from the outset, causing lower value,\nnonbusiness trips to use parallel non-tolled routes and very often pricing trucks off the\nexpressway also.\n\u2022 There is usually an inflation-based escalation clause, but real increases in tolls (e.g.,\nin excess of the rate of inflation) are often not permitted.\nTolls, which are central to delivering government\u2019s policy objectives, are rarely\nconsidered by governments as a policy tool \u2013 instead, they are defined by bidders against a\ngovernment requirement to minimize the tolls. It is not clear that this best achieves\ngovernment\u2019s objectives, for example:\n\u2022 Tolls that are too high lead to under-use of the expressway, contrary to transport\nobjectives. This is a common occurrence.\n\u2022 Tolls that are too low (and cannot be increased) lead to congested expressways, which\ndefeat their original purpose.\n\u2022 Tolls that are too high for trucks result in them avoiding the expressway, instead continuing\ntravel through towns etc.\n\u2022 Low tolls for buses can result in huge benefits for low-income travelers \u2013 usually a\ngovernment objective, but only implemented in Malaysia, to our knowledge.\n\u2022 Tolls do not vary by time of day/week, yet congestion on many inter-urban expressways\nusually does. Maybe higher tolls at congested times would be desirable.\nThis private sector-led, ad hoc practice may not suit anybody\u2019s best interest.", "77\nc. Integration Requirements\nThere are several forms of integration. They can hugely affect expressway traffic and\ntherefore benefits and revenues. All require government to define its policy - but few governments\n(yet) do this effectively:\n\u2022 The expressway must be physically integrated with the existing corridor and area.\nJunctions must be located (or be capable of location) at the right places \u2014 to serve\npresent and future requirements - i.e., government must specify its requirements, the\nconcessionaire will be concerned mainly in the short-term.\n\u2022 Expressways must be linked effectively with the existing road network, allowing\nconvenient access and regress. Often this requires road improvements and traffic\nmanagement outside the expressway site, something government must implement.\nIncreasingly, it should involve integrated transport control with the existing road\nsystem. If special facilities are required for buses, these need to be designed from\nthe outset.\n\u2022 Expressways must themselves be physically linked.\n\u2022 The tolling technology of different expressways should at least be compatible. This would\nallow each to charge different tariffs, but be more attractive to the driver \u2014 with less stopping\nand queuing to pay (this is already a problem in the Klang Valley in Malaysia); and desirably\neasier payment through the introduction of electronic tolling.\n\u2022 Possibly, the tariffs of different expressways could be integrated into a common tariff\nsystem. This requires a central revenue collection and allocation mechanism and is\nobviously not easy to implement - but it will become much easier when electronic\ntolling becomes widespread. The benefit would be substantial \u2014 increased traffic on\nthe system as a whole, as routes are not distorted by different tariffs for each\nexpressway.\n5. Social and Environmental Impacts\nThere is current concern in ADB and elsewhere about the impact of private sector-led\ntransport infrastructure on social equity and the environment. On the one hand, has it harmed\nthese core objectives, and on the other, have opportunities to promote the social and environmental\nagenda been missed?\n\u2022 Land acquisition and relocation \u2013 the evidence here is reassuring: due processes for\nsecuring land, and relocating and compensating affected families have generally been\nrespected.\n\u2022 Serving development objectives - in some cases38 the objectives of the road are\nnot well defined. Are inter-urban roads or roads near the urban periphery required to\n38 ADB is currently addressing this issue in PRC in the context of the substantial lending programme for expressways.", "78\nbring land into efficient development, or to serve longer-distance \u2018through\u2019 traffic? If\nthis question is left to the concessionaire, he will focus on the existing major traffic\ngenerators and attractors. The issue reverts to the need for government to identify\nsuch major projects, including the location of interchanges, and the access\ninfrastructure.\n\u2022 Policy for lower-income \u2013 Malaysia has demonstrated that by the simple expedient\nof keeping bus tariffs low, and designing separate facilities for motor-cycles, lower\nincome passengers benefit, without major detriment to project finances. They would\nbenefit more if the accesses at interchanges were designed with bus access and\nstopping in mind. This requires government to set policy. With this isolated exception,\nwe are unaware of any such policies being applied anywhere.\n\u2022 Visual impact and severance - the BOT policy as implemented in many big cities is\ncreating an elevated spaghetti of structures. The visual impact does not appear to\ncause the concern that it would in, say, Europe. Severance is clearly often a major\nproblem which is rarely addressed.\nThe conclusion, based upon the evidence, is that the concern about social and\nenvironmental impacts is opposite. Much could be done to align such projects better with\ngovernment\u2019s stated objectives.\n6. Ensuring value for money\nGovernments need to ensure they are getting value for money from expressways,\nwhether or not the public sector contributes to their funding. In practice, the public sector is likely\nto have to make a substantial contribution. Governments also need to be sure that any public\nsector contribution is a priority use of scarce public funds. Establishing performance against this\ncriterion is necessary both as part of the normal audit role of government, and to inform future\npolicy in the light of experience.\nGovernments therefore need to:\n\u2022 Identify, structure and procure PSP projects, using best-practice guidelines such as those\nestablished in this technical assistance.\n\u2022 Make use of public sector comparators (a database of expressway unit costs would be\na valuable input to this process) to ensure that the bidders\u2019 cost estimates represent a\ngain over having the project commissioned as a public sector project.\n\u2022 Establish the economic value-for-money of expressways - through before-and-after\nstudies.\nD. Identification\n1. Introduction\nIdentification is the process which allows government to:\n\u2022 Determine strategy.\n\u2022 Identify projects for priority implementation.", "79\n\u2022 Determine the role for the private sector.\n\u2022 Specify key features of the project that affect its priority in the roads program.\nTo be meaningful, the results of these activities must be accepted widely. The process of carrying\nthem out must have the right institutional setting if they are to achieve this essential support. It is for\nexample, not unusual for major transport studies undertaken by one ministry to be ignored by others,\nwhose support is necessary for implementation.\nIdentification must:\n\u2022 Determine the overall transport strategy in the context of government\u2019s development strategy/\nplan. This comprises transport policies, investment in projects, and institutional components.\nFor cities, and for some other corridors/areas the strategy will be multi-modal, defining the\nrole of road sector improvements in overall strategy.\n\u2022 Determine the core projects of the roads sector, which could be implemented as PSP\nprojects. Guard against other projects - which may conflict with the transport strategy.\n\u2022 For these priority PSP projects, prepare feasibility studies, with a focus on economic viability,\nimplementability and fundability. Government must confirm that permissions can be obtained,\nthat necessary land can be acquired, and people relocated. The project vertical alignment (if\nrelevant) must be acceptable on environmental grounds.\n\u2022 Define how the project is to be integrated into the transport system: defining the\nlocation/nature of physical interchanges, and the required impact on the capacity of\nthe existing road.\n\u2022 Define the tariffs, which must be socially acceptable. These materially affect economic\nviability, and must be considered at this identification stage.\n\u2022 Define special requirements - for example access for buses (hence for low-income travelers\n- these impose special design requirements) and their tariffs.\n\u2022 Determine the broad risks and scale of government support (investment and guarantees)\nthat will be necessary.\n2. The Importance of Identification\nIdentification is particularly important in the land transport sector. Not all projects are\ngood \u2014 an expressway in the wrong location can cause enormous problems \u2013 hence, identifying\nthe right project is important:\n\u2022 For example in a big city, it is conventional for mass transit to be improved down\nradial roads to the city center, with expressways serving circumferential movements,\nwhich are less easily catered for by public transport. But if expressways are instead\nbuilt to/through city centers, the strategy is fundamentally undermined, and th\u2019ere is\nno prospect of controlling traffic congestion \u2014 Bangkok suffers from this problem.\n\u2022 If too many expressways are built, the strategy is similarly undermined. Again in\nBangkok this occurs: in the northern corridor, the Second-Stage Expressway System,\nthe Don Muang Tollway and Hopewell have been developed by different sponsoring", "80\nagencies \u2018in competition\u2019. Second Stage Expressway System was opened first and\nis successful; the Don Muang Tollway was second and has had huge problems -\nGovernment now owns part of the equity; while the Hopewell project which was\nthird has been abandoned while part-completed.\nMajor road projects must be integrated in the network. This requires positive action\nboth in the corridor and adjacent to it. If expressway junctions are not in the right place, or\ninterchange designs are poor, or the design/construction has not been well-devised, or provision\nhas not been made for buses, or local road improvements necessary to provide access to the\nexpressway have not been made - then:\n\u2022 Traffic and revenues on the expressway will be tower than they should be.\n\u2022 Land in the expressway corridor will not be developed efficiently.\n\u2022 Traffic congestion on the existing road will remain (particularly if its capacity has been\nreduced by expressway construction).\n\u2022 Lower income bus travelers may not benefit.\nIf a network of expressways Is being developed through projects implemented by competing\nconcessionaires, integration becomes particularly challenging. Physical interchange must be\npossible, toll equipment integration is desirable, and tariff integration may become possible. When\nsuch integration is made to happen, the network becomes more attractive to use (with less stopping/\nqueuing to pay, and easier payment mechanisms), and traffic increases, in turn, leading to\ndecongestion on the existing roads.\nExperience.is that integration does not happen when there are several concessionaires,\nwho perceive each other as competitors. Government therefore needs to define integration\nrequirements, and impose these on private concessionaires.\n3. From Public to Private Sector Process\nThe typical public sector identification process of the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s may be characterized\nas planning-led and often based upon what in insight has been an optimistic future scenario. To\nsome extent, this approach continues today. It typically assumed that once the project(s) was\nidentified, its implementation was a neutral process.\nIt typically featured, in turn, the development of the following, with decisions taken at the end\nof each stage:\n\u2022 A development strategy \u2014 the context for.\n\u2022 A transport (or roads) strategy - which allowed priority projects to be identified.\n\u2022 A feasibility study of a priority expressway \u2014 this allowed government to commit to\nimplementation.\nThe requirements of the planning process in the era of PSP are both unchanged, and\nyet very different. What is unchanged is the requirement that there must be a clear framework\nof objectives from which to determine strategy and identify projects, and the importance of\neconomics and cost-effectiveness in determining what should be done. While PSP changes\nthe impact of expressways, the resulting project is still required to be economically (as opposed\nto financially) viable.", "81\nThe main differences are an emphasis on:\n\u2022 Implementability and fundability - the public sector approach presumes that these issues\ncan be overcome, once a good project is identified. The private sector approach\nrecognizes the reality that these are absolutely critical - because implementation and\nfunding of land transport projects are both very difficult.\n\u2022 Acceptability - of tariffs, and of environmental impacts (particularly for elevated structures).\nThe absence of these will prevent implementation.\n\u2022 The implementation process. The presumption that, once identified, this is neutral is\npatently wrong. What happens during implementation has a profound effect upon the\nproject impacts - hence on the costs and benefits of the project.\n\u2022 Risk and upon developing a robust, rather than optimal project. The project\nenvironment clearly requires this, yet it is rarely addressed adequately by the public\nsector.\n\u2022 Innovation in both process and projects. In process, to fast-track the project\ndevelopment cycle (which, particularly when development banks are involved, can be\nvery long), and in projects, recognizing that the public sector does not hold a monopoly\non good ideas.\nThese changes are unambiguously necessary. The sole issue in the new era of PSP is\nhow best to make the change. Specifically, what are \u2014 or should be \u2014 the bounds of the public and\nprivate sectors?\n4. Roles for the Public and Private Sectors\nPrevious sections of this report have reviewed the evidence. The firm conclusion is that\nwhile the private sector has often thought it could identify and implement expressways, this has\nonly exceptionally proved possible. Even in UK this was thought possible, but it has failed.39 And,\neven if this were possible, we have noted that not all projects are \u2018good\u2019.\nThe unambiguous conclusion is that government must set policy and determine strategy.\nThe issue then is how this is done - and how the undoubted benefits of PSP can be realized.\nThere is no monopoly of knowledge here, instead much experimentation, and lessons are\nbeing learned.\n39 Original proposals for the Birmingham Northern Relief Road, one of the first BOT proposals in UK, left the private sector to define\nthe precise alignment, in the expectation that land holdings and associated development might determine alignment and thereby\ncontribute to financing. The result is that government has had to define the detailed alignment, and now (10 years later) this is still\nbeing opposed and is awaiting permissions.", "82\nE. PSP Modalities\n1. Introduction\nThere are several tasks to be undertaken in the planning and construction of\nexpressways, as follows:\n\u2022 Planning.\n\u2022 Design.\n\u2022 Finance.\n\u2022 Land acquisition/relocation.\n\u2022 Construction.\n\u2022 Operation (primarily tolling, but including management of the road-checking vehicle\nweights, cleaning the carriageway, maintaining lighting fixtures, etc.).\n\u2022 Maintenance.\nIn a pure public sector project, all functions are undertaken by the public sector. However,\nin most countries, there has already been some evolution away from force account construction,\nand construction is undertaken by a private construction firm, under contract. Typically, the\ncontract is determined by the detailed (public) design and does not allow for variations except\nunder change orders. This process requires significant levels of supervision from government\nand often sees substantial price rises during the course of the contract as a result of the\nchange orders.\nPrivate sector involvement has at least one of the objectives:\n\u2022 Reduction in immediate cost to the public sector (through use of innovative construction\nor design techniques, tighter cost control, or risk allocation).\n\u2022 Improved revenue collection, through improvement in revenue collection and through\nreducing the extent of revenue leakage.\n\u2022 Transfer of some risk to the private sector (under the traditional construction contract,\nchange orders leave much of the risk with the public sector and there is typically no\npenalty for late completion of work).\n\u2022 Reduction in public sector maintenance responsibility.\n\u2022 Development of private sector skills (in maintenance management, in design, etc.).\n\u2022 Understanding and unbundling of requirements and priorities so that each requirement\nis explicitly acknowledged rather than being wrapped up (bundled) into a single all-\nencompassing contract, which is the normal practice under public sector provision.\nIt is important to note that the objective(s) are not always achieved in practice, whether as\na result of poor concession design, an overriding desire to involve the private sector in provision of\npublic services, or simply because of weak government.\nSome functions will nearly always remain in the public arena. For expressways this\nprobably only includes land acquisition and relocation. Ensuring that the practices undertaken", "83\nmeet the appropriate social and environmental guidelines is important and could be difficult to\nmonitor. The risks involved are very high and include time delays and cost escalation, as well as\nconsiderable political/public opinion risk. Since the risks are so high, transferring this role to the\nprivate sector would be costly.\n2. Options for PSP\nTable 17 presents the generic options for PSP, and illustrates the continuum in PSP\nexperience that they represent. It should be noted that intermediate contract forms can be devised\nwhich include elements of more than one option.\nReading from the left, the forms of contract presented offer:\n\u2022 An increasing transfer of risk and financial responsibility to the private sector.\n\u2022 An increasingly large public policy commitment from government, since the contracts\ntend to be in place for longer periods of time.\nKey features of this table are:\n\u2022 Not all of the risks specified are always transferred to the private sector - this is decided\non a case-by-case basis.\n\u2022 The contracts are performance driven. In traditional government construction\ncontracts, the full details of procedures and quantities to be used are specified. In\nthese contracts, by contrast, the inputs are not specified, rather the government\ndetermines the level of service which it requires (e.g., the road capacity and ride\nquality) and allows the private contractor to determine how it can most effectively\nprovide those requirements. This leaves government with the role of ensuring that\nthe services provided are as specified, and making payments or charging penalties\nas agreed in advance.", "Table 17:   Characteristics of the PSP Options\nForm of Contract Maintenance Turnkey Operate & Maintain Rehabilitate-Operate- BOT Corridor Management\nManagement Transfer (ROT)\nDefinition Maintain Design & Build Maintain and Operate Finance, Rehabilitate, Finance, Design, Construct, Finance, Design, Construct,\nFree from Fixed Fee from Maintain and Operate Maintain & Operate Maintain & Operate a\nCorridor/Network\nExamples New South Wales US Argentina Argentina Malaysia; Philippines; UK (DBFO)\n- see case studies US Hong Kong, China Hong Kong, China Colombia Thailand, Hong Kong, China Colombia\nArgentina, US, etc.\nCost Recovery No income \u2014 fixed No income - fixed Typically government Concessionaire may pay Substantial government Government contributes\ngovernment government payment receives some toll Government or vice-versa investment usually required existing roads, and other\npayment revenue investment usually required\nScale of Private Very low Considerable for very Low Medium Large/ Very Large Medium/Large\nInvestment short term\nPrivate Sector Risks Maintenance Design Traffic & revenue levels Rehabilitation Design Design\nConstruction Revenue collection Traffic & revenue levels Construction Construction\nPolitical Revenue collection Traffic & revenue levels Traffic & revenue levels 8\nFinancial Political Revenue collection Revenue Collection 4\nMaintenance Financial Political Political\nMaintenance Financial Financial\nMaintenance Maintenance\nPublic Sector Risks Force majeure Revenue received Force majeure Planning Planning\n(land acquisition and Planning Social Social Force Majeure Force Majeure\nrelocation risks are Traffic levels Macro Macro\nalways carried) Maintenance Social/ environmental Social/ environmental\nTypical Contract size Small Medium/Large Small/Medium Medium/Large Very Large Medium/Large\n(US$ million) $50 - $800 m c. $l00m -$1 billion c. $90- $300 m\nMinimum size Small/local Medium/large Construction firm with Larger construction firm Consortium including major Consortium incl.: a\nconcessionaire construction firm construction firm management skills with management skills construction firms construction firm\nrequired\nExtent of Government Low High Low Medium High High\npreparation/super\nvision required\nTypical Duration 2-10 years Defined construction 2-10 years 10-20 years 25-30 years 25-30 years\nperiod only", "Figure 5:         Characteristics of the PSP Options\nRANGE OF PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION OPTIONS\nA B C D E F\nMaintainance Operate Corridor\nManagement Turn key and Maintain ROT BOT Management\n8\n5\nMakes Investment from the Private Sector over a longer period\nSIMPLE Consideration of Life Costs more likely COMPLEX\nMore Government Preparation and Supervision Required\nMore Risk Transfer possible: more effective PSP", "86\nThe most limited contracts, in terms of risk transfer, are those which employ the private\nsector for only one or two of the tasks. Typically this has been through a package of either:\nMaintenance management. Management of maintenance here refers to the business\nof deciding what maintenance is required and when, in order to achieve the desired level of\nservice on the road for the duration of the contract. The work may be carried out by the winner\nof the contract, or he may sub-contract elements to other parties, while being responsible to\ngovernment for performance delivery. These are typically short-term contracts since there is\nno need for large investments on the part of the contractor. The government makes a defined\nstream of payments to the concessionaire in return for its\u2019 achieving the pavement and other\nstandards defined in the agreement. If the standards are not achieved, then government will\nimplement an agreed penalty schedule. Such contracts are in use in UK, New South Wales,\nAustralia, and US.\nDesign and construction (turnkey contracts). These contracts require design and\nconstruction of a new facility (for which the alignment and basic construction parameters are\ndefined) to an agreed price and timetable. Should the timetable slip, the government may levy\npenalties as agreed, and sometimes, early completion leads to the payment of a success fee.\nThese contracts are often referred to as turnkey contracts, because the public sector is supplied\nwith a facility that is ready for use and they simply need to \u201cturn the key\u201d. Turnkey contracts\nhave been used extensively in the US.\nIn both of the above cases, the contracts are performance based and there can be significant\npenalties for under performance on the part of the contractor. These two options are also particularly\napplicable where government does not wish to allow tolls to be levied; instead it pays the private\nsector on a fixed-fee lump sum basis.\nPackaging elements together reduces the private sector risk, since they have direct control\nover important interfaces. This reduces the cost to the public sector.\nFull performance based, operate and maintain contracts are the next in the hierarchy\nof private sector involvement. Some parts of the network are maintained under this type of\ncontract in Argentina. The contracts involve specified maintenance standards and collection of\ntolls from traffic at agreed toll rates. The toll revenues will typically be collected and retained by\nthe contractor.\nThese revenues may be sufficient to cover toll collection and maintenance costs and the\ncontractors profit, and result in a payment to government. The revenue threshold above which\npayment will be made to government is usually defined in the concession agreement.\nThe three options so far described can be particularly applicable where:\n\u2022 Capital markets are not well developed (and therefore there is no access to long term\ndebt - so that the private sector could not take on a full BOT style contract).\n\u2022 The government is concerned about private capacity to undertake more comprehensive\ncontracts and/or its capacity to administer them.", "87\nIn some cases, where the road network is of particularly poor quality, resulting from many\nyears of under-funded or ineffective maintenance, rehabilitation is added to the operate and maintain\ncontracts. These are known as ROT contracts.\nThese require larger scale investments from the concessionaire. The standard of road\nsurface required is defined in the concession agreement and must usually be achieved within\na defined period of the contract commencing; before this time, tolls cannot be levied. The toll\nlevels are defined in the agreement (with escalation rates) and this revenue is used to finance\nthe rehabilitation, maintenance and operation. Depending on the degree of rehabilitation work\nrequired, and the traffic revenues, some government financial assistance may also be\nnecessary. In this case, contracts can be designed to allow governments to share in the upside\npotential as well.\nROT contracts are of slightly longer duration than the simple maintain and operate\narrangement, because of the need to re-coup the higher costs of rehabilitation. Such contracts\nhave been used widely in Argentina. Their basic advantage is that good rehabilitation is\nnecessary to minimize future maintenance to which the concessionaire is also committed (he\naims to minimize his total cost).\nNext in the hierarchy of transferring responsibility are the BOT style contracts. These\ncover design, finance, construction, operation, and maintenance. This has been the preferred option\nin Asia. These are very large projects in which the government and private sector agree the principles\nfor construction, maintenance, and management of a new facility which is then provided by the\nconcessionaire. Tolls are charged in order to finance the construction and where necessary (given\nthe traffic, revenue, and construction costs) these are supplemented by government. Again, the\ngovernment may share in the upside potential of the project. At the end of the long concession\nperiod, the road usually reverts to the government at no cost.\nThe final contract form is corridor management. This represents a combination of the\noperate and maintain (or ROT) and BOT contracts. The private sector takes responsibility for a\nroad corridor or a defined part of the road network. He is required to operate and maintain these\nexisting facilities and expand capacity as defined by government (widening or constructing new\nlinks).\nThis approach allows government to pass responsibility for the management and capacity\nexpansion of whole corridors or areas of the road network to the private sector. The contractor may\nbe given incentive payments on achieving performance standards (e.g., a reduction of accidents,\nor minimizing lane closures as in the UK DBFO); and be required to pay penalties where agreed\nperformance is not achieved.\nThese latter contract forms allow government to transfer many risks to the private sector,\nwhile gaining a road which it has planned for the national network. However in practice, the extent\nof risk transfer will depend on:\n\u2022 The relative strength at negotiation of the concessionaire and government.\n\u2022 The confidence with which toll revenues and construction costs can be predicted.", "88\n3. Ownership\nUnder the BOT and corridor management forms, there are two principal ownership\noptions for the infrastructure:\n\u2022 Ownership can be transferred on completion of construction to the public sector \u2014\nunder a sale and lease back arrangement.\n\u2022 Ownership can remain with the private sector for the duration of the concession and\nthen be transferred to the public sector (with or without a payment).\nUnder the first of these options (a Build-Lease-Transfer arrangement), the public sector\nwill operate the infrastructure for the duration of the concession, making lease payments to the\nprivate sector construction company. This is an evolution from the simple turnkey structure by\nwhich the government makes use of private sector financing for construction. The concept can\nbe supplemented by a maintenance and operation contract awarded by the government, under\nthe terms of which the lease payment obligations are transferred to the operations and\nmaintenance contractor.\nThe optimum ownership solution for each situation depends on local circumstances,\nincluding:\n\u2022 Structure of the concession company.\n\u2022 Local taxation arrangements.\n\u2022 Profitability of the expressway (and hence tax liability).\n\u2022 Duration of the concession.\n4. Planning\nThe most comprehensive transfer of risk and financial responsibility can be achieved\nwhen the private sector also undertakes the planning of the project. These are known as\nunsolicited bids to governments and are relatively common in some Asian countries. Their\nadvantages are that the private sector can be expected to carry all traffic risks (since it has\nadvocated a project). Their disadvantages lie in:\n\u2022 Their questionable cost effectiveness if, as often happens in practice, they are not\neffectively integrated into the existing road network.\n\u2022 The additional costs that the government may carry in providing supporting infrastructure\n(access roads, etc.).\n\u2022 The disruption to the network which has been planned by government, of which the\nproposed project may not be part. These network effects can be significant.\nThe Don Muang expressway in Thailand represents a clear example of failure to\nacknowledge these difficulties. In the concession agreement, the Government undertook to remove\nflyovers on the parallel existing road (reconstructing them to carry cross-traffic). However, this\ndid not happen and there was a delay of over two years, leading to significant under-use of the\nexpressway. This was a principal cause of the near bankruptcy of the concession company and\nthe need for a large cash injection from Government.", "89\nF. Legal and Regulatory Framework\n1. Legal\nPSP in the provision of public services has been limited until the last decade or so. This\nmeans that often the legal arrangements of a country have not yet been adapted to the requirements\nof private sector provision. In their absence \u2014 or the absence of their implementation, corruption\nhas sometimes emerged to undermine the benefits of PSP.\na. Why should Government be concerned with the Legal Environment?\nGovernments must seek to ensure that the objectives they have determined for the\nconcession are achieved. This can only be done if the legal framework allows it. Without an\nappropriate legal code in place, governments may find themselves challenged in the courts and\nthe process halted; there are several recent examples of this. Also, governments wish to ensure\nthat competition is maximized \u2014 to reduce the price of the contract; and that can only be done by\nensuring that potential bidders are not dissuaded because of the fear of inequitable treatment\nunder the law.\nGovernment needs to ensure that under the law:\n\u2022 Concessions are permitted (i.e., that government can transfer the right of construction\nand maintenance to a private party).\n\u2022 Tolling for use of public facilities, and tolling by the private sector, is permitted.\n\u2022 Exclusivity (where granted) is permitted.\n\u2022 Responsibilities are clearly divided between departments and levels of government\n(local, regional, or national), and that these different roles are co-ordinated, so that\napprovals are given effectively.\n\u2022 The legal framework in all areas - such as contract, land, or financial law (e.g.,\ncurrency convertibility and profit repatriation arrangements) - allows national and\ninternational companies to compete on an equitable basis. Labor and tax and\nimmigration laws are all important.\nb. Why should a Potential Bidder be concerned with the Legal\nEnvironment?\nBidding for BOT projects is costly \u2014 US$5 million is not unusual for a winning bidder in\nan efficient environment, and more where the BOT process is not well-developed. A stable policy\nand legal environment reduces these costs (which at the end of the day are usually borne by\ngovernment through the bontract price) and encourages keen competition.\nSince concessions typically include fixed delivery dates, concessionaires need to ensure\nthat they can meet those dates. If permits or approvals are held up in government, because\nresponsibilities are not clear, they may default on the contract despite their best efforts. Similarly,\na court challenge to the legality of their contract, even if eventually overcome, poses financial\ncash flow difficulties for the concessionaire.", "90\nConcessionaires are seeking to earn a return on their investment. They need to be\nreassured that they will be able to earn such a return and that they will then be able to repatriate\nthe profits if appropriate.\nDifferent private sector players will require different levels of assurance (depending in\nlarge part on their country of origin). However, their basic requirements will include reassurance\nthat:\n\u2022 The appropriate processes are in place to ensure that permits and approvals can be\nsecured when needed and that government can meet its obligations.\n\u2022 Their corporate structure is permitted Under the existing law.\n\u2022 Currency is convertible and profits can be repatriated.\n\u2022 Employment (including immigration), environmental, and safety laws are clear and\nreasonable.\n\u2022 Land law is compatible with the concession arrangements.\n\u2022 Accounting laws are known so that they can forecast the project financial return reliably.\n\u2022 The dispute resolution mechanisms are clear and provide reassurance.\nc. General Concessioning Law or Sector Specific Legislation?\nOnce governments have determined that they will change laws to achieve a satisfactory\nconcessioning environment, they may opt to make these changes globally, through a general\nconcessioning law which specifies the basic framework for PSP, or act at sector level. Regional\nauthorities also sometimes have significant power in the management of the concession process.\nMany of these comments apply equally at the regional and national level. With regional treatment\nof policy however, additional factors come into play, such as the treatment of national debts/\ncommitments, inter-regional requirements, and sharing of experience.\nSector level treatment will always be required because of the different nature of the\ncosts, the demand for the service, and the policy environment. Most countries select a hybrid\ntreatment which combines a sector specific with a cross-sectoral approach. The sector level\nmanagement allows different approaches to be used where appropriate and sector level\nexpertise to be developed at the same time. The cross-sectoral aspects protect government\nfrom developing inconsistent policies, from financial over-exposure, and ensures that sectoral\nexperience is shared.\nd. International or Local Law?\nDepending on the stage in development of national legal codes, and the extent to which\ninternational participation is desired, international legal codes may be invoked. Using\ninternational law can give foreign investors confidence that they will be treated equitably by the\ngovernment. The use of local law, with which a foreign company may be unfamiliar, can increase\nthe price of the contract to government, as the risks are perceived to be greater by the foreign\nbidder.", "91\nInternational laws are most often adopted for dispute resolution. Governments must ensure\nthat any arbitral awards are recognizable under the national legal codes. Concessionaires will want\nto be assured that the awards are enforced in practice.\ne. The Concession Agreement\nDespite the need for these specific legal arrangements, the concession agreement specifies\nthe rights and obligations of each party. This is the key legal document. It does not matter what has\nbeen said in the months (or years) of negotiation, or what has been written in the past \u2014 the critical\nrequirement is that the final agreement is understood and acceptable to the parties; for it defines\ntheir contractual rights and obligations, typically for 25-30 years.\nBoth governments \u2018and private sector operators therefore need to take the concession\nagreement very seriously, since it is here that much of their protection lies. The document\nembodies the principles which they have discussed over the period of negotiation. It is vital that\neverything is included in that document. Both sides will therefore want to employ skilled lawyers\nto help them get the most advantageous agreement. This probably means that they will require\nboth international and national lawyers, each bringing different perspectives and expertise to the\nnegotiations. Governments, in particular, are often unable to do this, and are seriously\ndisadvantaged as a result.\nObviously the larger the contract, the more important the agreement. Where these\nconcession agreements last for 30 years, there are many more eventualities to be considered\nthan those which cover only a two-year period. As well as this, the longer the period, the more\ncomplicated the financial arrangements are likely to be \u2014 this in itself puts more strains on the\nlegal structures.\nf. Legal Arrangements in the Case Study Countries\nTable 18 presents the legal and regulatory arrangements in place in each of the case\nstudy countries. Each has adopted a different legal approach. The Philippines has the most\ndefined legal environment (having passed two BOT laws) while Malaysia has no specific legislation;\nand Hong Kong, China; defines new legislation (an ordinance) for each project.\nThe absence of a clear legal framework and BOT process has resulted in little\ninternational interest in the expressway projects in Malaysia; however it is important to note\nthat building up local private sector players was one of the government\u2019s key objectives for\ntheir concessioning program. On this criterion the lack of a defined legal environment has not\nprevented success.", "Table 18:   Legal and Regulatory Responsibilities in the Case Study Countries\nCountry Relevant Laws National or Regional Sector Specific or Multi-sectoral Management Level of International\nLevel Management Interest/Involvement\nPhilippines 1977 TAB Law \u201cAuthorizing the National (NEDA) Multi-sectoral co-ordination and approval (NEDA - ICC) Medium-High\nestablishment of toll facilities on public\nimprovements\u201d Multi-sectoral implementation assistance and international\nresponsibilities (BOT Center)\n1990 BOT law\nSector specific tariff regulation (TAB)\n1994 Amended BOT law\nSector specific technical review (DPWH)\nMalaysia None National (EPU) Multi-sectoral decision-making and economic regulation (EPU) Low\nSector Specific concession and technical regulation (MHA)\nThailand 1993 Royal Act \u2014 framework for PSP National - excl.

Regulation40\nCompetition for the award of a contract does not provide protection against the abuse of\nmonopoly power during the operating period. While there is no simple and universal answer, a\ncombination of the following is likely to be effective:\n\u2022 The importance of the concession contract as a regulatory tool should, first and foremost,\nbe recognized. The contract allocates risks and rewards between the private and public\nsector parties, by defining legal rights and obligations. Therefore a sound contract should\nbe the starting point for any regulatory framework; this is one that exerts appropriate\nregulatory pressure on both parties. For example:\n- Shorter contract periods provide a useful curb on monopoly power.\n- Even for long-term contracts, short-term contracts can be employed with renewal\nor extension subject to meeting minimum performance requirements.\n\u2022 An independent regulatory framework and regulator is usually seen to be required.\nThis is often specified as requiring to be autonomous, separate from government,\nhaving clear and transparent procedures, and being accountable for decisions. But\nexperience shows this formula is neither unambiguous nor cost-free. What is likely to\nbe required is an autonomous and independent body that is also accountable. The\nsolution in each country needs to be developed in the context of its particular\ncharacteristics. It is likely that the regulator should be part of government, but quite\nseparate from the agency responsible for promoting, or having a direct interest in\nroads.\n\u2022 User groups, if sufficiently empowered (e.g., through an ombudsman function or as\nuser associations) can also exert a useful regulatory role on infrastructure providers. It\nshould be said that this is not yet generally well developed, but could become more\neffective.\nA government\u2019s willingness to manage the concession agreement with transparency and\ncommitment quickly becomes clear over the course of one or two transactions. If governments\nact within the confines of the legal arrangements, private sector confidence grows. If governments\nfail to follow these ground rules, then bids for subsequent projects will include substantial risk\npremiums. It is this desire to ensure that competitive pressures on price are retained through the\ncourse of a privatization program which ensures government commitment to agreed processes.\nThis is one of the reasons why private sector players tend to be more interested in a concession\nin a country with a program of concession projects.\n40 Regulatory activity can be divided into regulation for the market (covering regulation of market entry, usually by requiring entrants\nto bid for the right to provide services) and regulation in the market (curbing tendencies towards monopoly behavior). Regulation\nfor the market is discussed in section 7.9 \u2014 Procurement. Regulation in the market is the subject of this section.", "94\nThere are two basic forms of regulation: technical and economic. Each can be undertaken\nin two ways:\n1. Enforcement of provisions laid out in a concession agreement - through contract\nmanagement.\n2. Establishment in the concession agreement of separate processes for regulation (more\nakin to a full privatization process which establishes regulatory frameworks in order to\nprovide confidence for the private sector investors).\nThe options overlap in some cases where the concession agreement defines the technical\nprinciples (such as quality of the pavement) while it leaves economic issues (such as escalation of\ntoll rates) open.\na. The Nature of a Concession Agreement\nThere are two different ways of looking at the concession agreement:\n1. As the Regulation - the concession agreement should determine the required\nresponse, from concessionaire and government, to any situation. With this view,\nregulators are not needed - since regulation is through the contract (or through the\ncourts). Typically, the government agency or its\u2019 representative, monitors the\nconcessionaire to ensure compliance with contractual obligations. In some cases\nthey rely primarily on information provided by the concessionaires \u2014 with some\nspot-checking. Contractual enforcement can be through penalty payments or\nreductions in government support payments defined in the concession agreement.\nWhere there is no such prior agreement, or where these mechanisms have failed\nto achieve an improvement in the concessionaire\u2019s behavior, arbitration mechanisms\nare then used. Some contracts specify procedures for arbitration, others call on the\nuse of local dispute resolution law and others call on international law. In these\ncases contract management is all that is required.\n2. As a Guide to the Allocation of Responsibilities. Since concession agreements are\ntypically in place for periods of up to 30 years, and given the dynamic environment in\ndeveloping countries, it is not reasonable to expect that all eventualities have been\nconsidered during the negotiating phase. Hence with this view, the initial agreements\nare seen as setting the basis for future negotiations and instead present the approach\nto eventualities (risks or opportunities) which cannot be determined at the time of\nsigning. In this case, procedures for re-negotiation, including where appropriate, the\nuse of third parties and arbitrators, should be specified in the agreement.\nb. Interests of the Parties\nThe attitudes of the concessionaire and government to such concessions are determined\nby their interests. Government may be assumed to be primarily concerned with the public interest,\nwhile concessionaires are often interested primarily in the short-term. Most expressway\nconcessionaires are contractors (or a consortium dominated by the contractors), whose objective\nis to make construction profits and then exit as soon as financially attractive.", "95\nTheir primary concerns are:\n\u2022 Controlling risks during the (relatively short) implementation time.\n\u2022 Having a safe exit strategy, including selling-on at a reasonable price.\nThis price will be determined by any or all of the terms of the concession agreement, revenue\non opening, and market sentiment towards the profitability of such concessions.\nPossible early exit strategies are:\n\u2022 Private arrangement \u2014 finding a willing buyer.\n\u2022 Floating the project company on the stock exchange - this is done in Hong Kong, China,\nand planned in Malaysia, but has provided no easy answer. The traffic/revenue stream\non opening must be healthy.\n\u2022 Defaulting on payments to government, or other obligations, and hence forcing\ngovernment to resort to termination of the concession.\nc. Influence of the Timing of Re-Negotiation\nIf the concession agreement is signed, but implementation has not occurred, the\nconcessionaire is in a strong position \u2014 because the government does not want the major delay of\nre-bidding. Once the project is operational however, the government is in a strong position:\nthe facility exists and is used, while the investors have so far received no return.\nThe investors are then dependent on arrangements to collect or increase tariffs and for\ngovernment support for the project. These arrangements are typically specified in the concession\nagreement, but often not adhered to by the government in practice (see Table 21). In such cases,\nthe concessionaires tend not to walk away from the project. This is because of the investments\nwhich they have made (and on which they need to reap a return), and in many Asian countries\nthe view that the government would not let them down in the end and hence that profits will be\nmade eventually.\nd. Incentives for Government\nWhile most governments would claim that they view the concession agreement as the\nregulation, there are few examples of this being the case. There are strong incentives for\ngovernments to view the concession as a guide in practice, yet claim that the concession\nagreement is binding.\ne. Government Incentives to Re-Negotiate\nGovernment has many incentives in practice to renegotiate (avoiding re-bidding) when \u2018things\ngo wrong\u2019:\n\u2022 Governments enter into the arrangement because they perceive that the\ninfrastructure is important for the development of their country. If, through minor\nrenegotiation, they can still achieve this objective then re-negotiation is likely to be\npreferred.", "96\n\u2022 Once the concession agreement has been signed there are substantial sunk costs for the\ngovernment and there is a trade-off between incurring more costs from re-bidding, including\ndelay to the project, and incurring more costs through providing better conditions for the\nconcessionaire through re-negotiation.\n\u2022 A government may well take the view that if the concessionaire is in difficulty then if it were to\nhave undertaken the project as a public sector project with the same conditions, it too would\nhave been in difficulty.\n\u2022 Re-negotiation may allow the government to reap the benefits of new technologies\nwhich were not feasible at the time at which the contract was signed. For expressways,\nthis may apply to tolling options where government is seeking to develop an\nexpressway network, which requires common technology across the different projects\nwithin the network. In this case, without re-negotiation, the network may be inefficiently\nused for a generation.\n\u2022 It may be realistic and cheaper to separately provide for re-negotiation in the event of\nextreme circumstances which could not be reasonably foreseen, e.g., economic\ncrises. The alternatives are:\n- Force the concessionaire to accommodate all risks within the bid and therefore to inflate\nthe price of the concession \u2014 which is unrealistic.\n- If government is unwilling to accept such possibilities, the concessionaire may\nsimply ignore the down-side risk, taking the view that in these circumstances\ngovernment will have to renegotiate \u2014 an approach which ignores reasonable\nrisk allocation.\n\u2022 Where the government plans to extend the expressway operated by a concessionaire, he may\nhave the first option to bid. Government can then capture part of any unexpected profits made\non the first concession, through renegotiating that agreement and extending it to incorporate\nthe extension.\n\u2022 However, concessions are awarded through a competitive process. In this situation, if\nthe conditions under which the award was made are later changed, losing bidders are\nliable to challenge the legality of such subsequent changes. They may well claim that the\ngovernment would have secured better value for money had it selected their \u201creasonable\nand realistic\u201d bid in the first instance.\nf. Incentives for Concessionaires\nFor concessionaires, there are several conflicting considerations:\n\u2022 They may feel less confident that a future government will deal with them fairly, hence\nthey would argue for a fixed concession agreement from the outset. Otherwise, each\nnew government represents a new set of risks for the concessionaire.\n\u2022 Once the concession agreement is signed, the concessionaire is in a strong position\nuntil the project has been built. Negotiations during this period may allow the concessionaire\nto achieve an improved outcome.", "97\n\u2022 The concessionaire may recognize that not all eventualities can be foreseen or provided\nfor under the agreement, and therefore may be prepared to carry the risk of arguing for\nre-negotiation in the case of abnormal events, rather than lose the concession.\n\u2022 Where government wishes to impose change after the event (e.g., in respect to\ncompatible tolling equipment to increase use of the expressway network as a whole),\nthe concessionaire may be willing to negotiate on the basis of an assessment of the\nimpact of the change on his commercial position.\nAlso:\n\u2022 Where governments are weak then the concession agreement may need to be strong\nin order for the concessionaire to secure debt financing (and vice versa).\n\u2022 Where the private sector firm has international exposure and a good reputation,\narguments in favor of a flexible concession can be made. The danger of losing reputation\nmay be sufficient to control the concessionaires behavior.\n\u2022 However, international contractors also have international experience which they bring\nto the negotiating table. This allows them to drive a hard bargain. Therefore, the\ngovernment may not want to reopen negotiations if it has initially secured most of its\nrequirements.\ng. Regulatory/Contract Management Arrangements for Private\nExpressways\nDepending on the structure of the concession contract, contract management may be as\nimportant as the regulatory institutions.\nContract Management covers technical issues such as:\n\u2022 Land acquisition and clearance procedures.\n\u2022 Pavement quality and capacity availability.\n\u2022 Toll escalation mechanisms.\n\u2022 Toll plaza availability/revenue collection methodologies.\n\u2022 Safety management systems.\n\u2022 Environmental policies.\n\u2022 Vehicle weighing stations.\n\u2022 Collection of traffic data.\n\u2022 Commercial activities.\n\u2022 Payments to government.\nControl authorities are usually an arm of the road sector agencies. They often rely on\ninformation provided by concessionaires (checking it can be difficult). Reporting requirements for\nthe concessionaire are usually established in the agreement, and include access to financial\ninformation of the company, quarterly reports on traffic levels, road availability, maintenance\nundertaken, revenues, etc. The control authority is often the manager of public relations \u2014 the\npublic can be an important source of information on the basis of which the authority will act.", "98\nRegulatory bodies are concerned with economic regulation and may be involved when:\n\u2022 The tariffs are to be changed \u2014 if there is no agreed formula, but a maximum rate of\nreturn is permitted, for example, it will be the regulator\u2019s responsibility to establish whether\nor not that threshold has been reached.\n\u2022 The concessionaire calls for further government support for the project.\n\u2022 The concessionaire seeks to extend/widen the road.\nTable 18 presented the relevant laws and the managerial/regulatory framework for the\ncase study countries. It shows that most case study governments have selected a hybrid\nincluding both sector specific and multi-sectoral arrangements \u2014 usually maintaining economic\nregulation/management in a multi-sectoral body and allowing technical regulation/management\nto take place at sector level.\nNational rather than local management has been the norm too \u2014 which reflects in part, the\nweakness of the local government but also the undeveloped nature of local institutions.\nG. Structuring the Public-Private Partnership\nStructuring is the process of allocating risks associated with a project and project\nenvironment in the light of the interests of the key parties such that an acceptable agreement can\nbe reached. The result is the legally-binding concession agreement that will bind the parties together\nfor up to a generation or more.\nPublic-private partnerships are often perceived as the way by which the potential\nexcesses of private sector ownership, operation and management of public infrastructure can\nbe controlled by the public sector\u2019s interest in economic efficiency, equity, and the public good.\nIn fact, there is very little theory, practice or experience that can be adduced to demonstrate its\nfeasibility or efficacy. The PPP \u201cmodel\u201d is not the only method for the introduction of PSP,\nwhich is more appropriately characterized as the transfer of specific obligations to the private sector\nfor the provision of infrastructure on agreed terms and determined under conditions of competition.\nThe appropriate structure for the introduction of PSP depends on an understanding of the\nidentity and motivations of the various participants, the objectives that PSP is seeking to promote,\nthe choice of PSP modality and, the necessary conditions being present.\n1. The Key Stakeholders\nStakeholders in the PSP of an expressway, their interests and how they are impacted by\nPSP are set out in Table 19.", "99\nTable 19: Stakeholder Analysis of Parties to an Expressway BOT\n            Stakeholder                 Stakeholder Interest                     How Impacted: +? or --?\nPublic Sector\nPoliticians To improve economic growth, + PSP though to deliver domestic and\nstandards of living, quality of life international funding for expressway projects\n-- Lose some control of major infrastructure\nprojects\n-- Problem of introducing direct user charges\n(e.g., tolls)\nMinistry of Transport To improve quality and efficiency -- Threatened by the uncertainly of handling\nand officials of transport. over responsibility of highways to the private\nsector to be financed by way of tolls\nDepartment of To improve highway transport --Threat to their continued role in planning,\nHighways and officials designing, building and operating roads.\nMinistry of Finance To protect the revenue base, and -- Need to provide cash or guarantees in\navoid inefficient financing of support of private sector\ninfrastructure + Possibility of additionally\nPrivate Sector\nProject Sponsor To obtain/win a profitable + Expand profitably, if successful\nconcession\nContractors To obtain/win a profitable + Expand profitably, if successful\nconstruction contract\nExpressway Operator To obtain/win a profitable tolling, + Expand profitably, if successful\noperation and maintenance\ncontract\nT A Providers/Advisors To profitably provide TA + Expand profitably, if profitable\nFinancial Sector\nBanks To finance a \u201cbankable\u201d project + Expand asset portfolio, if successful\nInstitutional Investors To invest in new sectors of the + Expand asset portfolio, if sucdessful\neconomy\nInternational Financial To dispense development finance, + Justify role as development financiers\nsecure developmental benefits\nOthets\nUsers To have access to higher service + Improved accessibility\nroads, lower journey times, at\naffordable costs -- Threat of increased travel costs\nOthers affected on To be no worse off -- To avoid costs imposed by diversion\nCompeting routes\nOthers affected on To be no worse off --To avoid costs imposed through imposition\nExisting route oftolls", "100\nThe principal conclusions are that:\n\u2022 PSP involves many more players than the traditional way in which expressways have\nbeen procured.\n\u2022 Transfer of risk from the public to the private sector is likely to be of more positive\ninterest to the private than the public sector, which is more likely to be adversely affected.\n\u2022 The introduction of PSP in this sector involves the public sector giving up its traditional\nrole of provider, designer, builder, operator and maintainer, and financier. Under PSP the\npublic sector\u2019s role is that of intelligent procurer on behalf of clients who have limited\nexperience of the service, and where the public interest may be difficult to define.\nThis is a very different role for government, which is not accustomed to the identification\nand allocation of risks. Traditionally, all risks have been \u2018bundled together\u2019, and governments have\noften been either unaware of, or uninterested in them. Wherever PSP is introduced and practiced,\nwhether in the developed or developing world, the realization of this difference is the key issue that\nmust be understood for PSP to proceed.\n2. Key Conditions for Risk Transfer\nInfrastructure-wide studies in PSP have shown that there are four key conditions which\ndetermine the level and type of PSP that is feasible. These conditions must be present to ensure\nthat PSP is feasible and deliverable. They are:\n\u2022 Political commitment and stakeholder support to ensure sufficient of the participants\nsupport the transfer of risk.\n\u2022 Financial feasibility and degree of cost recovery to ensure the project is capable of\nbeing financially self-sufficient over its life.\n\u2022 Information about the technology employed and the state of the assets so that informed\ndecisions can be taken as to the value of the assets, and the costs of expanding or\nrestoring them.\n\u2022 Presence of a regulatory and monitoring framework that will protect the users from\nexploitation of a temporary monopoly and provide a basis for the measurement of\nimprovement of performance, etc.\nThe greater the obligations or risks to be transferred, the greater these conditions must be\npresent to ensure the effectiveness of the chosen modality of PSP. Thus, maintenance management\ncontracts require the conditions to be present, but at less onerous levels than for BOT and corridor\nmanagement concessions.\nExperience from developed countries (and in particular Europe) has highlighted the\nenormous challenge of building tolled expressways in terms of the costs and the risks involved.\nThis experience has demonstrated the ambitious nature of many plans in developing and\ntransitional states, and provides encouragement to start with less onerous forms of PSP to\nensure greater success.", "101\n3. Risk Identification and Allocation\nMany risks and responsibilities in the highway sector are capable of very clear definition.\nDesign standards for structures and highway surfaces are capable of high levels of measurement\nand definition. Technical specifications, maintenance cycles, and traffic levels can be precisely\nspecified. The impact of the introduction of tolling can be measured.\nFor new construction, there are greater unknowns; capital costs of new vehicle crossings,\nbridges or tunnels, the impact of soil conditions on new construction, and the timing of phased\ncapacity expansion contain higher levels of uncertainty. These characteristics of the roads sector\nemphasize the case for allocating measurable risks to private sector participants as the best way\nof gaining acceptance of the approach, and ensuring the costs of allocation and transfer are\nminimized.\nIt is a principal of project finance that risks are allocated to the party best able to manage\nthem. Diversion from this principle will lead to sub-optimality, and result in higher than necessary\nprices for risk transfer.\na. Expressway Risks\nTable 20 summarizes the risks which are typically faced on a PSP expressway. Naturally\nsome apply only to the more ambitious forms, but all are present on many. The list is not meant to\nbe exhaustive, but to illustrate the scale of the problem in allocating and managing risk.", "102\n       Table 20:           PSP Expressway Risks\n  Risk Category                                    Description\nDesign \u2022 Cost of re-design resulting from poor initial design\n\u2022 Increased construction or maintenance costs due to\ninitial design assumptions\n\u2022 Incorrect geotechnical assumptions at design stage\n\u2022 Planning permissions\n\u2022 Site clearance\n\u2022 Failure of designer\n\u2022 Government-imposed changes\n\u2022 Non-compliance with specifications\n\u2022 Designer the scapegoat when things go wrong\n\u2022 Approvals procedure leads to increasing costs\nConstruction \u2022 Unforeseen preparation costs\n\u2022 Safety requirements not foreseen\n\u2022 Materials used cause unforeseen maintenance costs\n\u2022 Interference from third parties e.g., protesters\n\u2022 Unforeseen ground conditions\n\u2022 Unexpected impact of environmental regulations\n\u2022 Land contamination\n\u2022 Noise restraining orders\n\u2022 Labor problems\n\u2022 Problems with quality and price of labor, materials and plant\n\u2022 Problems with sub-contractors\n\u2022 Site access problems\n\u2022 Adverse weather conditions\n\u2022 Death or injuries on site\n\u2022 Suspension of works\n\u2022 Traffic diversion problems\n\u2022 Drainage/flooding problems\n\u2022 Third part claims\nTraffic and \u2022 Traffic diversion lower than expected\nRevenue \u2022  Ramp-up longer\n\u2022 Few trucks use the road\n\u2022 Toll increases don\u2019t happen\n\u2022 Toll increases adversely affect traffic\n\u2022 Failure to improve local road access deters traffic\n\u2022 Improvements to other competing roads reduces traffic\n\u2022 Improvements to competing modes reduces traffic\n\u2022 Change to development plan and major concentrations of activity\n\u2022 Government increases taxes, duties of vehicles use\n\u2022 Failure of tolling equipment\n\u2022 Pilferage\n\u2022 Illegal payments to police etc. deters traffic Operational\n\u2022 Vandalism\n\u2022 Cost and overruns in tolling equipment\n\u2022 Corruption\n\u2022 Force majeure - catastrophic event (earthquake, accident etc.)\n\u2022 Traffic-related problems - accidents etc.\n\u2022 Unexpected additional costs\nMaintenance \u2022 Material and labor cost increases\n\u2022 Pavement failure to high truck use/poor design\n\u2022 Unexpected weather problems\n\u2022 Traffic management requirements increase costs\n\u2022 Non-compliance with maintenance requirements\n\u2022 Inferior workmanship\nFinance/Other \u2022 Legislative delay\nRisks \u2022 Inflation\n\u2022 Currency crisis\n\u2022 Interest rates\n\u2022 Insolvency of promoter, contractor or members of consortium\n\u2022 Inability to refinance\n\u2022 Expected tax allowances not forthcoming\n\u2022 Riot, war, invasion\n\u2022 Change of government\n\u2022 Discriminatory law changes", "103\nThe major categories of risk for a tolled expressway, and the party best able to assume the\nrisk are as follows:\nb. Completion Risk\nThis is the risk that the project may not be completed, may be delayed or may exceed its\nbudgeted cost. Generally:\n\u2022 The government has control over land acquisition and obtaining the necessary\npermissions for the project, and it should assume these risks.\n\u2022 The concessionaire has control over the design and construction risk, and he should\nbear these risks.\nc. Commercial Risk\nThis is the risk of traffic on opening, the rate of traffic growth, users\u2019 willingness-to-pay tolls,\nto some extent the capacity of the road, and the cost of operations and maintenance.\nThe concessionaire\u2019s control over commercial risk is only partial. He can:\n\u2022 Control his operations and maintenance costs effectively.\n\u2022 Utilize the latest tolling technology to maximize the attraction of the facility.\n\u2022 Use advertising and public information campaigns to increase awareness of the benefits\nof the project.\n\u2022 Market the road, for example, targeting major potential users, and maybe offering\nconcessions.\n\u2022 Lower toll rates when they are too high, to increase market penetration. Concessionaires\nare, however, reluctant to do this, perceiving that once reduced, they may forego the\nprospect of increasing the tolls later to compensate.\nBut the main traffic risk remains. First is the risk of producing good traffic forecasts - often\nthey are seen not to be good. Second, the forecasts are dependent upon factors which are\nsubstantially outside the control of the concessionaire.\nThere are many examples of concessionaires taking the traffic risk, and then failing. It is\nincreasingly recognized that, particularly for green-field projects, where traffic is particularly uncertain,\ntraffic risk should be shared.\nOne promising solution is for \u2018super-profits\u2019 resulting from higher than expected traffic to\nbe shared, together with downside guarantees by government, in the event that traffic is much\nlower than expected. This reduces the project risk, and avoids the politically difficult accusation\nagainst government officers when faced with super-profits (that the deal may not have been let\nproperly).", "104\nd. Financing Risks\nConcessionaires use debt to leverage their equity, thereby increasing their returns. Moreover,\nthis debt provides a mechanism for distributing risk among the parties. All project proponents face\nthe risk of obtaining financial terms which are inferior to those expected (e.g., when interest rates\nare higher than expected). To a certain degree, however, concessionaires have control over the\nfinancing terms, via their negotiating skills, track record, and bankability. Financing risks should\ntherefore be borne by the concessionaire.\ne. Devaluation and Inflation\nThese are major risks, as the recent economic crisis has demonstrated. These are primarily\nwithin the control of government, and it is appropriate for government to assume these risks. This\nis normally done through incorporation in the toll escalation process.\nf. Default and Force Majeure\nThese contract provisions have a major impact upon the risk that the concessionaire and\nthe banks are willing to assume. For example, the Government of the Philippines insists that if the\nconcessionaire defaults, the project be taken over by the banks. In the case of Government default,\nthe proponent needs to be compensated. Again, in the Philippines, in some cases, the proponent\nagrees to be compensated for the remainder of the concession period the projected net income\nbased on the original financial model, while in other cases, a lump-sum payment is agreed in the\nform of debt guaranteed by Government.\ng. Tariffs and Financing\nToll rates are regulated to protect users from paying excessively high rates, and governments\nusually seek to keep tolls as low as possible. But this must be balanced against the imperative to\nfinance the road. A number of issues typically arise:\n\u2022 The willingness of motorists/companies to pay toll rates, and the feasibility of introducing\nthem is determined by many factors. These include the level of existing tolls if any, and\nwhether the existing road has hitherto been free, e.g., for people who made decisions\nabout where to live on the basis of free roads, and then found high tolls imposed. The\ncase is entirely different for new roads. Typically therefore tolls are low when introduced\non existing roads, but can be high on new roads.\n\u2022 Government should be clear about the use of the toll-road it seeks, and the tariffs should\nbe set accordingly, and incorporated in the concession agreement. It is common\nexperience that tolls for all traffic are too high, or that tolls for trucks are too high, or that\nbuses are charged high tolls. It is sometimes argued that \u2018governments have no money\u2019\nand that this is necessary. But this sometimes misses the point, for:\n- Lower tolls results in increased traffic, and often increased revenues too, and this\ndecongests the existing roads \u2014 so everyone benefits.\n- Lower tolls for trucks will often increase revenues too, and reduce the environmental\ncosts of trucks traveling through existing centers.", "105\n- Low tolls for buses may contribute importantly to social equity objectives, at small\ncost to government. The question should be what trade off between these objectives\nshould be.\n\u2022 Tariffs should be escalated, on the basis of an agreed formula. These formulae have a\nhuge impact upon the projected return of concessionaires, and may typically take many\nmonths and iterations before agreement is reached.\nh. Escalation Formulae for Toll Rates41\nThere are different approaches, for example:\n\u2022 Return on Rate Basis \u2013 this estimates the allowable revenue. Each year operating\nexpenses are reimbursed and the concessionaire is given a defined return on his\ninvestment, inclusive of working capital. The tariff is the allowable revenue divided by\nthe estimated traffic at the toll plaza.\n\u2022 Return on Equity \u2013 a financial model of the project is built, and the escalation formula\nmakes provision for changes in inflation, devaluation and possibly interest rates. An\nallowable return is determined, based on returns for similar projects and the toll rate\nrequired to achieve this return is calculated.\n\u2022 Project Return \u2013 this is as for return on equity except that it does not consider financing.\nThe financial return is calculated assuming 100 percent equity, and the allowable project\nreturn determined, based on returns for similar projects and the toll rate required to\nachieve this return is calculated.\nEach method has its pros and cons. These include the following issues upon which\ngovernment needs to decide its position:\n\u2022 Stability of the tariff over time.\n\u2022 Willingness to provide traffic guarantees \u2013 it is argued above that these risks should be\nshared.\n\u2022 Willingness to participate in financing risk \u2013 it is argued above these should normally be\nborne by the concessionaire.\n\u2022 Provision of incentives for efficient operation \u2013 these should be provided.\n\u2022 Extent of government regulation that is required. This may simply be limited to operating\nand maintenance standards, or it may also include checking allowable operating\nexpenses, or may include financing.\n\u2022 Ease by which the toll escalation is computed.\n41 What follows describes the policy of the Government of the Philippines, described in their \u2018General Features of\nFinancial Aspects of Negotiated Toll Road Agreements\u2019, dated 12/04/98.", "106\nThe last project return approach is the one adopted by the Government of the Philippines.\nIt retains the advantages of the return on equity methodology, and has the additional\ncharacteristics:\n\u2022 No regulation is required relative to financing.\n\u2022 The concessionaire assumes the financing risk.\n\u2022 It may be wise to ensure a minimum equity commitment by the concessionaire to ensure\nhis commitment.\n\u2022 It targets a project return of 20 percent, in dollar terms. This is benchmarked against\nreturns in other countries, and takes account of the specific circumstances in the\nPhilippines. It provides for tax breaks in accordance with local practice.\nAccordingly, implementing rules have been devised that provide a transparent basis for the\ncalculation of tariff reviews, which may be increased annually.\n4. Conclusions\nIntroducing PSP in the roads sector involves the transfer of obligations from the public to\nthe private sector on terms that are negotiated under conditions of competition. Inevitably, the\nchange can involve shifts in traditional patterns of power and control that are difficult to surrender.\nExperience has shown that, in many cases, PSP has yielded significant improvements in\nproductivity, capacity expansion, and performance.\nHowever, PSP must be targeted with the appropriate objective, otherwise sub-optimal\nsolutions may result. Secondly, the appropriate PSP option must be chosen. Thirdly, the correct\nmodality will be determined by the presence of the key conditions of stakeholder support, financial\nfeasibility, regulatory and monitoring framework, and knowledge of the state of the operating\nassets and their current performance. Fourth, risk should be carried by the party best able to\ncontrol or insure against it. The extent to which risk can be transferred in practice will depend on\nindividual circumstances.\nH. Financing\n1. Introduction\nSecuring debt has always been a limiting factor in this sector. While many entrepreneurs\n(mainly contractors) have promoted projects, banks have always been wary.42\nThe recent economic crisis has clearly exacerbated this situation considerably, and in the\nfuture:\n\u2022 There is likely to be less equity - entrepreneurs that have had their fingers burned are\nnow more cautious, and the Japanese economy has reduced the funds that contractors\nand trading houses have to invest abroad.\n42 This section concerns securing private sector risk capital. In Asia there are examples of private sector capital being\nbacked by government - this is no more than a contingent public sector liability, and does not help secure PSP\nobjectives, through risk transfer.", "107\n\u2022 There is likely to be less debt. Asian, especially Japanese, banks have less to invest\nand are more careful about where they invest.\nThese changes are being reinforced by the general downgradirtg of many sovereign\nshort and medium-term credit ratings, following the re-alignment of a number of Asian\ncurrencies.\nThis is a sobering background given that banks are able to invest anywhere and in any\nproduct. They will only invest in road sector concessions if the expected returns are comparable\nwith other opportunities, given their overall portfolio strategy.\nFinancing comes at the end of the PSP process, but the constraints it imposes must be\nconsidered from the outset. If a sound business case has been prepared, the project risks\nidentified and allocated in a realistic manner and the procurement process credible and well\nexecuted, then financing should follow on the basis expected. But if these preconditions do not\nexist it may well not be available.\n2. Project Characteristics\nThis section looks specifically at expressway financing characteristics.\nRevenues are difficult to forecast because:\n\u2022 Revenues derive from tolls which must be introduced on previously free routes.\n\u2022 Some traffic will be diverted by the introduction of charges. The impact on traffic volumes\nis difficult to forecast, and changes over time.\n\u2022 Traffic levels are low initially and uncertain in the medium/long term.\n\u2022 Depending on the tolling method and strategy introduced, there are many opportunities\nfor toll avoidance, toll loss (through uncollected tolls), and toll undercharging.\n\u2022 Toll levels must be affordable based upon users\u2019 willingness-to-pay.\n\u2022 Toll levels can be revenue maximizing (desired by project sponsors) or socially\nmaximizing (desired by governments to ensure the highest utilization). The objectives\nof the public and private sectors are always in conflict.\n\u2022 Tolls structures must not have the effect of discriminating against certain groups of\nusers.\n\u2022 Toll escalation mechanisms often suffer from political interference.\n\u2022 Non-toll revenues \u2013 i.e., from advertising, other retailing concessions, etc are small -\nand yield typically perhaps five percent of total revenues.", "108\nCapital costs are lumpy and difficult to phase:\n\u2022 Land acquisition costs are an important proportion of overall costs (typically\n15 percent, but up to 50 percent in the center of big cities).\n\u2022 Expressways must be built in anticipation of future demand.\n\u2022 While there are phasing options, they are rarely exercised, and in any case many costs\nmust be absorbed in advance, e.g., earth works, bridges, culverts, etc.\n\u2022 Necessary tolling equipment, plazas etc. often involves foreign technology, and the\nplanning, design and management process increases the requirement for foreign\nexchange.\nOperating costs:\n\u2022 Tolling, maintenance, and related costs typically amount to 15 percent of gross toll\nrevenues, and place a substantial burden on early debt service capacity.\n\u2022 A variety of additional services (lighting, communications systems, signage, safety and\nemergency services) are required on limited access, high service expressways.\n\u2022 The existing alternative routes must still be maintained.\nThe resultant expressway project cash flow is typically:\n\u2022 Highly dependant on traffic volume growth to repay debt.\n\u2022 Burdened by large front end costs in land acquisition.\n\u2022 Weakened by the possibility of the emergence of competing routes.\n\u2022 Susceptible to political interference in route selection and in the toll increase mechanism.\nIn addition to these difficulties specific to tolled expressways, there are additional obstacles\nto be overcome in the financial markets and in the legal and regulatory spheres.\n3. Impediments to Financing\na. Financing Obstacles\n\u2022 Expressways require long term debt \u2013 15 years or more.\n\u2022 To avoid foreign exchange risk, borrowings should be in local currency. However, the\ncapital markets of many emerging market countries do not have sufficient long-term\nstructures; and even if the term structure is available, funds are frequently dedicated to\nother kinds of projects, carrying lower perceived risk.\n\u2022 Inflation adds further burdens to financing costs and risks. At the extreme, high inflation\nprecludes domestic borrowing.\n\u2022 If domestic borrowing is not available, then an element of foreign funding is necessary.\nHowever, foreign borrowing is no substitute without a natural hedge.", "109\n\u2022 Foreign exchange risk for the portion of the funding borrowed in foreign currency and\nrepayable in foreign currency must be covered in the toll; yet large shifts in currency\nrates can render some expressways beyond the means of the users to pay. Recent\nevents in Asia emphasized the critical importance of this.\nb. Legislative Impediments\n\u2022 There are legal requirements in most countries for the availability of a free alternative\nroute.\n\u2022 There is sometimes (as in countries of the Asian sub-continent) a legal requirement for\ntolls to be removed after debt is repaid, leaving no dedicated funds for long-term operation\nand maintenance.\n\u2022 There has been success in recent legal challenges to the government\u2019s right to levy\ntolls, in the absence of specific legislative powers to do so (this is currently an issue in\nHungary).\nc. Regulatory Impediments\n\u2022 The absence of a regulatory framework is not always bad, however, there needs to be\na body that looks after the public interest through: controlling tolls, controlling the returns\nto operators, and protecting against competing roads in the same corridor.\n\u2022 Problems arise where there are conflicts within government for control of the regulatory\nfunction.\nGiven these obstacles, it is not surprising that investment by the private sector in tolled\nexpressways has required a large element of support by the host government.\n4. Government Support\nGovernments can improve the financial viability of expressway projects in many ways. They\nmay do so by:\n\u2022 Reducing construction costs through the grant or purchase of land, endowment of\nexisting highway assets, the provision of other inputs, and reduction of taxes on\ninputs.\n\u2022 Reducing the operating costs through support in the initial years.\n\u2022 Increasing the returns to sponsors through corporation tax holidays on equity earnings.\n\u2022 Retaining certain risks that are not transferable at a reasonable cost such as shortfall\nguarantees on opening traffic volumes.\n\u2022 Providing guarantees for the availability and conversion of foreign exchange\nborrowings.\n\u2022 Providing project credit guarantees, (such as traffic short fall guarantees) to the banks\ninvited to finance the projects.", "110\nThe more that actual and contingent risk is retained or absorbed by government on\nbehalf of sponsors and banks, the lower are the PSP benefits that are believed to arise. Many\nof the expressway projects in Malaysia and Indonesia have depended heavily on government\nsupport, to the extent that the projects have become virtually contingent risks on the\ngovernment\u2019s balance sheet. Much government support has been wrested from governments\nby strongly placed sponsors through superior negotiating tactics, close connections with political\nparties, or brinkmanship by threatening to withdraw from the project that has already begun.\nSome government support is neither visible nor strengthens the project (as opposed to the\nsponsor\u2019s investment).\nThe solution is neither difficult nor unavailable. Effective government support must be\ndesigned and specified at the time the project is being prepared by the relevant agency for\nexecution. Specification and design of the support package is an integral part of establishing\nthe financial viability of the expressway project - as fundamental as understanding the capital\ncosts, the tolling strategy, the initial traffic volume and levels and structure of opening tolls.\nThe costs associated with preparing and bidding for expressway projects could be\nsubstantially reduced if the nature and quantum of government support was to be made\navailable at the time of tendering. Very often, this is not the case, but only emerges during\nnegotiations. Further, it should be made clear that the ministry of finance, which in most\ncountries is the relevant authority to provide support, has agreed to the support, and that the\nsupport is available.\n5. Guarantees and Insurances\nThere are three generic sources of guarantees and insurances:\n\u2022 Government guarantees - from the concessionaires point-of-view these are \u2018free\u2019\nand are always sought; but from the public sector viewpoint, they reduce the transfer\nof risk, and hence the basic purpose of the PSP process. Traffic volume guarantees\nare frequently sought by private promoters and sponsors of expressway projects\n(often on behalf of banks). Even if granted, however, these can be of doubtful value\nunless the guarantor is able to fulfill the guarantee, and the guarantor is able to exercise\nit. Contingent risks of many governments are only now being adequately accounted\nfor. Many commercial banks have a much more limited appetite for sovereign risk\nthan governments would like to think.\n\u2022 Guarantees taken out by the government, to improve the project finances and\nhelp attract finance. Like all guarantees, these come at a cost, and the greater the\nrisk the greater the cost. One recent innovation promoted by the international\ndevelopment finance institutions is to provide specific guarantees \u2014 the partial credit\nguarantee and the partial risk guarantee \u2014 that address specific structural problems\nin the ability of financial institutions to participate:\n- The partial risk guarantee, guarantees that a government-owned body, which is\nparty to a contract, will meet its obligations under the contract. It is provided in\nfavor of a project\u2019s lenders, where the project\u2019s output is sold to a state-owned\nenterprise with a weak creditworthiness. A good example is an electrical power\ndistributor. In event of the purchaser\u2019s failure to pay, the guarantee is called, and\nthe project lenders avoid a loan default, with all the consequences. The partial", "111\nrisk guarantee has limited application to expressways, except in the case, for\nexample, where a state-controlled highway authority with responsibility for paying\nsupport (or shadow tolls) was unable to pay.\n- The partial credit guarantee is used to extend the term structure of debt. It has the\neffect of purchasing from project lenders the portion of the loan that is outstanding\nat, say, 10 years, which might be part of a loan requiring a 15-year maturity. Lenders\ncan then commit funds for 15 years knowing that they require funding for only 10\nyears. This form of guarantee has applicability in those countries where a\nsatisfactory expressway project may be established, but where the credit markets\nare unable to commit and fund loans for the full term.\nSuch guarantees are provided by ADB and the World Bank, but to date have had little\ntake-up, in spite of several attempts to repackage them. Firstly, recipient governments\nare generally unwilling to counter-guarantee the grantor of the guarantee (usually a\ndevelopment bank) - they want cash not contingent guarantees. Secondly, there are\nmore fundamental project-related credit issues that cannot be overcome by the\nguarantee route.\n\u2022 Insurances - these are normally taken out for very infrequent but calamitous events\n-force majeure. They can help, but insurers never lose money from project finance -\na large risk will, therefore, carry a high-risk premium.\nThe overall conclusion is that guarantees and insurances can help in putting a financing\npackage together, but they do not make a big difference and they are not an easy solution to\nresolving the problems that exist.\n6. Expectations of Equity and Debt Providers\nNotwithstanding the difficulties outlined above, expressways continue to be planned and\npromoted in many emerging, industrializing, and transitional countries.\na. Equity\nSponsors or promoters of road schemes are frequently the principal equity providers.\nExpressways are relatively low-tech infrastructure projects, unlike power stations,\ntelecommunications facilities, railways or airports.43 Sponsors are frequently contracting\ncompanies, which themselves are not well capitalized. Their ambition is frequently to make a\nsufficient profit in construction, then to exit once the project is open. The returns from operating\nthe facility over 20 to 25 years are less important to them.\nInstitutional investors, however, require a risk-adjusted return on their investment (usually\nexpressed in US$ or some other hard currency) of at least 20 percent before tax. These figures\nare known from the various publicly listed companies that have been floated in South East Asian\nmarkets. These levels of return are difficult to achieve on large equity investments,\n43 \nThe introduction of electronic tolling considerably increases this complexity.", "112\nand are threatened by the very public source of the toll revenues that underpin them. Returns to\nestablished toll operating companies in developed markets are below this threshold, typically\nreaching a percentage rate of return in the mid-teens, before tax.\nb. Debt\nCommercial banks that are persuaded to support expressway BOT projects are driven\nby different requirements. Discerning banks will expect a soundly based project where the risks\nhave been realistically identified and allocated to establish general creditworthiness. The bank\nwill then consider the security package offered in support of the transaction in the event that the\nproject cash flows do not materialize as planned. Finally, they will consider whether the loan fits\nwith their strategy and portfolio, whether it can be funded, and the adequacy of the fees and\npricing, e.g., the margin they will receive over the funding costs.\nBanks may seek additional security, they will frequently seek a higher margin. In the\nfinal analysis, they are looking for well-structured lending opportunities where they believe the\nborrower will service the loan as planned, by paying the interest costs and repaying the principal\nat the times agreed.\n7. Typical Financing Structures\nTheories as to the right or appropriate financing structure abound. There are as many\nfinancing structures as there are financiable projects. The limited recourse financing structure of\ninfrastructure tends to be a function of the shape of the cash flows available to service it and the\nsecurity package offered.\nThe funding structure for an expressway project typically comprises:\n\u2022 Bank senior debt - debt that has first call on the available cash flows (and security).\n\u2022 Subordinated capital - debt with second call on cash flow and security.\n\u2022 Equity - capital that is fully at risk.\na. Bank Senior Debt\nIn most cases, the limiting factor in financing an expressway is the amount and term of\nsenior debt that a project is able to attract. This is usually determined by the ratio of the project\ncash flow to the debt service requirements. Banks often seek 1.5 times the debt service\nrequirement. This can be reduced to a lower margin through changing the repayment schedule\nor providing additional security or support. Bank senior debt might typically provide 60 percent\nof total project costs, including interest during construction and inflation. Banks will lay down\nthe terms and conditions on which the loans would be advanced and these would typically\ninclude the requirement that all equity should be paid into the project company before any debt\nis available.\nb. Subordinate Capital\nFrequently there is a requirement for further finance, neither debt nor equity. This gap\nfinance is increasingly offered by the development finance organizations in support of their\nefforts to support PSP. In several Asian countries, investment funds are established to provide\nthe subordinated debt. Terms typically stipulate a minimum equity contribution, a commercial", "113\nmargin occasionally with a carried interest in the equity, and a counter guarantee from the host\ngovernment.\nc. Equity\nTo obtain the required return to equity, there is a tendency to risk as little as possible.\nThe less put at risk, the higher the eventual return for the same cash flows available to the\ninvestors. Notwithstanding this, equity amounting to 20 percent of the capital costs is not an\nuncommon requirement. More equity will reduce the overall rate of return. Less equity will not\nconvince the banking community that there is enough at risk to ensure the full co-operation of\nthe investors.\nA desirable capital structure might be:\n\u2022 60 percent commercial debt.\n\u2022 20 percent subordinated capital.\n\u2022 20 percent equity.\nHowever, when the government has made a significant contribution in kind, such as an\nexisting section of expressway or the corridor on which tolls will eventually be charged, it may\nretain an interest, or require a profit-sharing arrangement to be developed. This permits it to\nrecover some return on the original public stake, or to ensure the equitable division of returns\nonce the expressway has attained profitability.\nIn the final analysis, the capital structure is the result of negotiation among players with\nvarying degrees of market and political power, influence and resources. Rarely is the structure\nfully efficient. Banks are often required to take risks they are unprepared for. Often, governments\nare forced to retain risks that reduce the benefits of PSP. The relatively few transactions that\nhave been concluded and the long time required establishing the success of the transaction\nmeans that the costs of failure are still to be assessed.\nThere is much debate about whether government should hold an interest in the project\ncompany to which the risks are transferred, and in some countries (such as Indonesia), this is\nobligatory. Arguments for so doing include the government\u2019s need to safeguard interests and to\nensure against abuses of the monopoly power of the private sector under the concession.\nArguments against, include the need to ensure that the private sector toll operators\u2019 powers are\nsufficiently regulated in the concession agreement. In any event, the private sector cannot be\nexpected to be responsible for social objectives that the government might wish to pursue.\nContinued government involvement can also lead to management inefficiencies and unresolvable\nconflicts of interest. The growing sophistication of concessions, monitoring and performance\ndevices further reduces the case for a continuing role for the government in the concession\ncompany.", "114\n8. Availability, Sources and Terms of Debt\na. Availability\nReference has been made to the exchange rate and convertibility risks imposed on a\nproject resulting from dependence in infrastructure projects on domestic revenues to repay foreign\nborrowings. These risks affect the project\u2019s ability to meet all its financial obligations, and\ndependence on foreign financing significantly reduces the number and scope of projects that\nmight be financed compared to the situation which would exist were domestic sources of funding\nto be available.\nHigh and volatile inflation rates also shorten the investment horizon and distort economic\nactivity. Although long-term investment in a high inflation environment can be funded by loans,\nprovided a high nominal interest is charged, inflation-adjusted interest rates are not a viable\nsolution. In particular, they create problematic cash flows, not solved by compressing the loan\nrepayment schedule. A record of low and stable inflation is usually required to extend a country\u2019s\nfinancial horizon. It is also a decisive factor in developing long-term fixed income securities that\nare so necessary in financing major infrastructure projects.\nIt is not surprising that the price volatility and swings in economic activity, frequently\nexperienced in developing countries, even those growing at high rates of growth, have limited the\ndepth and breadth in their capital and credit markets. Availability of domestic finance is therefore\none of the most serious obstacles for the expansion of PSP in infrastructure throughout the\ndeveloping world.\nGeneral pre-conditions for the availability of appropriate infrastructure finance are:\n\u2022 A sound macro economic environment.\n\u2022 Stable prices.\n\u2022 Stable exchange rates.\nThose countries with developed financial regulatory frameworks monitoring the capital\nmarkets (stock exchange), and credit markets, (banks) are best favored to supply appropriate\ninfrastructure financing instruments.\nb. Sources\nThere are four main sources of debt for infrastructure projects such as expressways:\nCommercial Banks - commercial banks have played a very small role in financing\ninfrastructure, due to the maturity structure of their liabilities. There is simply not the deposit\nstructure to permit long-term funding on a matched basis. Commercial banks in some developing\ncountries are the subject of interventionist policies, particularly where state-owned enterprises\ndepend on policy-driven credit decisions. In some developing markets virtually all bank credit is\nallocated and governments impose controls on how bank assets are held.\nThe current economic crisis is expected to lead to substantial restructuring of many\ndomestic and foreign banks in Asia. A viable project finance banking community should emerge\nas a result of rationalization and re-capitalization of the commercial banks.", "115\nBonds and Bond Markets - Fixed-rate bonds are among the most suitable instruments\nfor long-term infrastructure, provided there is sufficient stability and predictability in the project\ncash flows. If inflation is likely to change rapidly, investors will seek shorter terms and floating\nrate instruments to protect against swings in real interest.\nPre-conditions are the existence of a government bond market against which project\nbonds can be priced. At present, the term structures of government bond markets are limited\n(typically seven years), and are thin at the longer-term horizons.\nBond rating agencies and credit enhancement are ways of overcoming these\ndeficiencies. However, investor interest in long-term project bonds, denominated in other than\nstrong currencies, is severely limited. It is likely to require a period of stability to return in Asian\nproject and currency markets before bonds are likely to be available for long-term project\nfinancing.\nPension Funds and Domestic Institutional Investors - A significant provider of project\ndebt for infrastructure in Asia and South America has been the major state pension funds and\ncontractual savings systems. Previously required to invest in government securities, permissible\ninvestments have been progressively widened to include infrastructure. Also, pension funds are\nincreasingly permitted to invest some small part of their funds in equity rather than first ranking,\nsecured debt.\nDomestic savings institutions are likely to re-assess their exposure to projects during the\npresent downturn in Asia. It is likely that some institutions will be reassessing their policies in the\nlight of the performance of some of the projects. 1999 will no doubt constitute a watershed for\ndomestic savings institutions, as they understand the impact on their portfolios of certain project\nfailures. It will be a test for their understanding and management of project risk. They will emerge\nstronger as a result of the experience.\nc. Conclusion\nOn a scale of 1 (low) to 4 (high), the short and medium-term prospects for funding in the\nsector from these four sources of debt may be along the following lines:\nSource Short-Term Medium-Term\nCommercial banks 1 3\nBonds 2 3\nPension Funds 3 4\nInstitutional investors 3 4\nI. Procurement\n1. Introduction\nRegulatory activity can be divided into two broad categories:\n\u2022 Regulation for the market \u2013 covering regulation of market entry, usually by requiring\nentrants to bid for the right to provide services.", "116\n\u2022 Regulation in the market \u2013 curbing tendencies towards monopoly behavior.\nRegulation for the market \u2013 this is generally agreed to require open and competitive\nbidding. Without this, the evidence is that corruption and/or nepotism may prosper to the detriment\nof achieving public policy objectives.\nProcurement involves:\n\u2022 The development of government\u2019s business case.\n\u2022 Marketing of the project to potential bidders.\n\u2022 The bidding process leading to contract award and negotiation of the concession\nagreement.\n\u2022 Supervision of implementation - until the project is operational.\nProcurement in PSP is the process by which the terms and conditions on which the risks\nto be transferred from the public to the private sector are determined and negotiated. It is the\nprocess of achieving a PSP project in accordance with the stated objectives of the public party\nwhilst achieving the requirements of the bidder and lenders. A project will not proceed if the latter\ncondition is not satisfied, it should not proceed if the former condition is not satisfied. There is a\nrequirement for a procurement process which can effectively achieve both conditions without\nsuch a drawn out and costly bureaucratic process as to dissuade bidders from participating in\nPSP.\nSuccessful procurement depends upon realism and preparation, transparency, and\ncompetition, and clearly defined procedures, through the procurement framework.\nRealism and preparation - some governments have, in the past, demonstrated an\nunjustifiable optimism that any project offered to the private sector will be enthusiastically taken\nup. There were also private sector players who ignored hard realities and initiated and promoted\nprojects that from the outset would clearly not be viable candidates for public-private partnership,\nexcept with excessive public sector funding. There were investors who did not make a thorough\nand realistic assessment of an opportunity, resulting in their demanding unreasonably hard and\nsafe terms or else accepting terms and conditions which would lead to failure; in either case\nundermining the credibility of the approach.\nThe financial consequences of inadequate project preparation, from a government\u2019s\nviewpoint, could be serious. If the technical, traffic demand or financial aspects of the project are\nnot thoroughly investigated and understood by the government\u2019s negotiators, then the resulting\nconcession terms could represent a bad use of public funds. On the other hand, if because of\nlack of preparation, government negotiators fail to recognize ways in which a project could be\nmade to work, then the provision of vital infrastructure might be delayed.\nTransparency and competition - Comprehensive procurement processes are adopted\nin many cases. But there are many instances where PSP projects have been progressed - by\ndefault or design - without full assessment of public interest issues and without transparency\nand competition. Since a government is effectively creating a form of private monopoly, albeit\nlimited by time, caps on charges, and restrictions on prospective rates of return etc., it should\nnormally wish to ensure transparency of process, and competition for the market the private\nsector will operate, to ensure the public interest is protected.", "117\n2. Procurement Frameworks\na. Common Practice\nWhere a component of a highway project which involves PSP is to be financed with a\ncontribution of one of the multilateral development banks, this may determine the form of\nprocurement - specifically there may be a requirement to procure under conditions of\ninternational competitive bidding or at least on the basis of comparable unit prices. In other\ncases, government procurement in many countries is determined on an ad hoc basis. The\nneed for improvement is well-recognized and much is being done to develop and promote\nbetter practice.\nSome of the countries which have embraced PSP, have recognized the need to overcome\nthe reputation for bumpy playing fields and cronyism that had developed through previous regimes.\nOther countries which are trying to promote PSP, for example Bangladesh, India and Pakistan\nare continuing in their efforts to formalize policies and procedures. But much remains to be\ndone. While the private sector is encouraged to contribute its experience and innovation in a\nvariety of ways, the process is sometimes subverted, for example:\n\u2022 The grant of concessions prior to finalizing the terms and conditions assumes that\nthe consortium will act in the public interest.\n\u2022 The type and quantum of government support the consortium might be able to negotiate\nmight lead to some of the project risks not being transferred.\n\u2022 A continuing interest that a government agency might have in the concession company,\nor its regulation may lead to unacceptable conflicts of interest, or inadequate\ncompetitive challenges.\nb. Better Practice in Asia\nThe Philippines\u2019 efforts in establishing a procurement framework, introduced as part of\nthe policy to promote PSP, provides one possible model. The process was launched in 1993\nthrough legislation and accompanying regulations.44 The process was linked with government\u2019s\npolicy to attract foreign direct investment and to implement the priorities of the national\ndevelopment plan.\nThe procurement process was and is facilitated by the BOT Center, which markets projects\nto the private sector, and provides services and assistance to implementing agencies and to\nlocal government in the development, bidding and implementation of infrastructure projects. In\nthis way the BOT Center supports and advises government - and helps to ensure it understands\nand can fulfil its undertakings, and can facilitate and influence the entry of project sponsors and\nfinanciers into the country\u2019s PSP program.\n44 Republic Act No. 7718 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations.", "118\nThe procurement framework comprises the following stages:\n\u2022 Project prioritization and approval.\n\u2022 Marketing to bidders.\n\u2022 Pre-qualification of bidders.\n\u2022 Evaluation of proposals.\n\u2022 Award of contract.\n\u2022 Project implementation.\nRegulations govern the manner and timing by which the framework is operated by the\nresponsible line ministry. The existence (and acceptance) of the procurement framework for\nPSP is a substantial advantage to both bona fide bidders and professional civil servants, and\nimportantly is sending the message that government requires effective procurement performance.\nThe Philippines process - not without critics and problems in its adoption and operation - does\nhave the following strengths:\n\u2022 It promotes transparency and competition.\n\u2022 It informs all parties as to the procurement process, their roles and responsibilities.\n\u2022 It increases confidence and promotes credibility generally.\nBecause of insufficient resources and proposal evaluation skills, projects are reportedly\nnot being prepared as thoroughly as they should. This is not a fault of the process but of its\nresourcing. Other concerns relate to the objectivity of the process when line ministries joint\nventure with the private sector, and to its susceptibility to political interference. That said, the\nBOT law, and the process it supports, is an effective step in introducing a more credible\nprocurement mechanism, which is now evolving with experience.\nc. Better Practice Elsewhere\nIt is clear from experience in the developed world that the process of public procurement\nis becoming increasingly important. With the UK Government\u2019s Private Finance Initiative (the\npolicy by which private management, techniques and finance are introduced to wide areas of\npublic economic and social infrastructure), a 14 stage procurement process has been recently\nadopted.45\nThis process concentrates on establishing the business case for the infrastructure\nneed, the options for both public and private sector provision, and measuring the value that the\nprivate sector solution is capable of delivering compared with the public sector alternative.\nThere is also a specific approval of the public sector affordability of any private sector solution,\nand confirmation of the availability of the funding support that is required through the life of the\nproject.\nOnly when a project\u2019s outputs are fully and thoroughly defined, when its value for money\nover the competing public option are quantified, and when the mechanisms and quantum of\nsupport is determined and secured, is the task of concession award considered. This concern\n45 Step by Step Guide to PFI Procurement, HM Treasury, July 1997.", "119\nwith project design, risk transfer, and value for money reflects the importance attached to\nminimizing the costs to bidders and satisfying the government that the process avoids controversy\nand criticism. It could be considered in developing countries as a way of building confidence\namong international investors, bankers, and private sector participants.\nSince UK is a member of EU, which aims to facilitate the free flow of goods and services\nbetween member states, the UK must also abide by EU procurement rules. The first stage of the\ntendering process is a call for interested parties to pre-qualify through the placement of an\nappropriate advertisement in the Official Journal of the EU.\nFrom the pre-qualified applicant, a short list of up to seven potential bidders is then invited\nto tender, usually with carefully specified criteria for determining the winner. The process might\ninvite the bidders to offer alternative methods of supplying the services, differences in phasing,\nor mechanisms for payment. However, they would need to be presented in a manner consistent\nwith the compliant bids to ensure that award was based on consistent criteria.\nAfter initial evaluation in accordance with the published criteria, a preferred bidder would\nbe selected for the presentation and negotiation of a best and final offer. The runner up would be\ninvited to step in, should agreement not be finalized with the preferred bidder. Once negotiations\nare completed, the contract or concession is awarded and the bidder proceeds to financial close,\nwhere the financing is put in place.\nWhile considered by many to be bureaucratic and time consuming, the general advantages\nof this process are that it minimizes costs to bidders, and provides the procuring authority with\nadequate competition to protect the public interest.\n3. Business Case\nOnly when government has prepared a demanding Business Case, will it understand the\nfinancial and risk characteristics of the project. Then, in preliminary discussion with the market\n(potential bidders and bankers), it will be in a position to understand how/whether risks can be\nallocated such that it can confirm government\u2019s willingness to proceed - given the public sector\nsupport which will be necessary, and the terms which will be necessary to attract keen bids.\nOnly with this information can government negotiate meaningfully.\nThe failure to prepare an authoritative Business Case is therefore risky for government. It\nmay lead to no project, or it may lead to an unsatisfactory agreement. Only when government\ntechnocrats are properly informed will they be confident in negotiations, and will the process be\nefficient. This is sought by the private sector too, they would much prefer to negotiate with an\ninformed client than one who is not prepared.", "120\nThe Business Case is specifically concerned with:\n\u2022 The legal basis for a concession.\n\u2022 Land - acquisition, associated resettlement, and permissions necessary for\nconstruction.\n\u2022 The roles of government in implementation, operations and regulation (who does what\nin government).\n\u2022 The revenue stream, on which financing critically depends. What are the risks? Can\nthey be mitigated and/or supplemented?\n\u2022 The risks - and developing the basis for risk allocation between the parties.\n\u2022 Establishing the right balance between the key stakeholders, in the light of their interests\nand expectations - users, sponsors, investors, and government.\n\u2022 The requirement and form of government support - in terms of financing, guarantees\nand other incentives.\n\u2022 Establishing procedures for ensuring that the government support provides good value-\nfor-money.\n4. The Potential for Innovation\nUnsolicited bids pose a particular problem, since governments usually wish to encourage\nprivate sector innovation, which is seen by the private sector as in conflict with competitive bidding.\nThe solutions to this are typically:\n\u2022 Either a formalized, tight but open competitive bidding procedure, which gives the\nprivate proponent an in-built advantage in that he tends to know more about the\nproject than the competition (having been involved in developing it from the beginning).\nThis has in the past been administered in Hong Kong, China to demonstrable effect.\n\u2022 Or a price-matching, in which case competing bids are invited after acceptance by\ngovernment of a pre-emptive proposal. If the competitive bid is better, the original\nproponent has the opportunity to match the terms, and contract award is made. This\napproach has been applied in the Philippines.\nNeither of these approaches is entirely satisfactory in typical developing country\nenvironments. Very often, the project timescales stretch out without contract award, to the\nincreasing frustration of all concerned. It is becoming clear that there should be a progressive\nshift towards assisting government identify potential PSP projects - which should then be subject\nto competitive bidding.\nTypically, it has been found that government must define the route, identify the junction\nrequirements, specify the vertical alignment (elevated/at-grade/underground), and define the land\nenvelope needed (i.e., commit to clearing/acquiring land). The concessionaire may be given\nfreedom to offer innovation in: design - e.g., structure versus embankment - with far-reaching\nenvironmental as well as cost consequences; in devising tolling arrangements; and in devising\ntariff structure.", "121\n5. Implementation\na. Access to Expert Advice\nThe PSP world is characterized by much specialism, and it is essential for government to\nhave access to the same expert advice which is the norm in the private sector; yet to date, this\nseldom been possible.\nThe BOT Center approach implemented in the Philippines has been described, and this\ngoes a considerable way to providing this expert advice in fields such as project finance, legal\nissues and documentation, negotiation etc. But even here, there is need for access to world-class\nplayers in many cases.\nThere are mechanisms to achieve this, and it is a role where development banks can play\na pivotal role. For example, a PSP Fund may be set up, initially by a development bank, and thereafter\nsustained by allocations from the bidding process (a fixed fee per bidder, increasing towards contract\naward, in return for government\u2019s front-end activity identifying and preparing the project). The purpose\nof the fund could, for example, cover project identification, bidding and negotiation - and would\nenable government to access international and local experts in a responsive way. Such a fund\ncould be for a single sector or multi-sector.\nb. Marketing\nIt is not the case that there are many bidders and banks waiting to implement any project,\nquite the opposite in fact. So it is essential that the procurement process and specific projects are\nactively marketed to interested parties. Part of this process to understand the market sentiment to\nthe country/sector/project, and this should help determine the terms of the bidding. The result of\ngood marketing is stronger consortia and potentially more competition. Marketing takes the form of\ndelivery of full technical, legislative, economic, financial, and environmental summaries to targeted\nparties who are likely to have an interest.\nc. Documentation\nThe principal document to be negotiated is the Concession Agreement, which sets out the\nprincipals that determine the relationship of the Concession Company with the government entities.\nAt the center of the concession document are the obligations and responsibilities of the parties, the\nterm of the concession, and the basis for termination and for hand back, if a BOT.\nThe contents of a BOT concession typically include the following:\n\u2022 General definitions \u2013 Project description, guarantees, financial model.\n\u2022 Operations \u2013 Land requirements, design and construction, construction program,\ninspection, operations and maintenance, management, hand back, insurance,\ngovernment obligations.\n\u2022 Relationship and monitoring \u2013 Representatives, records, reports and information,\nmonitoring of performance, other parties responsibilities.\n\u2022 Payment mechanisms \u2013 toll levels, toll structures, escalation formula, other revenue\nearning enterprises.", "122\n\u2022 Changes, liabilities and terminations \u2013 Change procedure, force majeure, indemnities,\ndefault, termination, compensations.\n\u2022 Miscellaneous provisions \u2013 Assignment of rights, consents, taxes, dispute resolution,\nwaivers, amendments, governing laws etc.\nMany schedules are attached which contain detailed information and data.\nIn addition to the concession agreement, there is usually a substantial enabling legislative\ntask for government permitting the concession company to commence its activities, regulations to\nbe enacted and land to be resumed or acquired. Following the award of the concession, the\nconcession company\u2019s major task is securing the financing which prior to then has been studied\nand may have been underwritten on a contingent basis.\nd. Bidding and Evaluation\nThe purpose of the bidding procedure is to secure effective competition up to the point of\ncontract signature. There is much experience of how best to do this and the case studies provide\nexamples.\nMany who have been involved in this process emphasize the importance of three issues:\n\u2022 The value of having simple evaluation criteria - this sector is suited to such criteria. For\nexample:\n- either submit the lowest tariff for agreed government support\n- or submit the lowest level of government support for defined tariffs.\n\u2022 The importance of specifying the project requirements closely, to ensure that the\nevaluation is indeed comparing like-with-like.\n\u2022 Offering the opportunity for bidders to submit non-conforming bids, in addition to\nconforming bids. This is designed to secure innovative ideas from the private sector.\ne. Ensuring Value for Money\nThe test of good procurement is ensuring that the private sector solution is more cost-\neffective than the public alternative. This requires the public sector to estimate what the public\nsector costs would have been. The UK DBFO program puts great effort into designing reliable\n\u2018public sector comparators\u2019, but for developing countries the information is often not available to do\nthis. Instead benchmark costs of similar projects can be assembled - for the country in question,\nand internationally. This will allow bid prices to be benchmarked against best practice.\nPSP in the provision of infrastructure is a relatively recent innovation in both the developed\nand the developing world. PSP was formerly excluded \u2018on the grounds that, other things being\nequal, the public sector could still borrow to finance projects more cheaply than the private sector,\nwhich would require a risk-related return on the funds employed. There were also misgivings about\nthe private sector\u2019s behavior and the ability to safeguard the public interest.\nConsumers of public services have discovered that political interference, shortage of\nfunds and poor management have caused the performance of many publicly-owned and\noperated  services  to  decline.  It  has  been  realized  that  the  benefits  of  private  sector", "123\nmanagement, technology, preparedness to invest and innovate often outweigh the saving in financing.\nFurthermore, many governments admitted they could not raise the finance required.\nWhile availability of finance has been the principal reason for governments to consider PSP\nin developing countries, the challenge remains for governments to satisfy themselves that private\nownership, construction, operation, management, and financing is a better alternative than a public\nalternative. Procurement executives should be mindful that the public sector comparator, however\nmeasured, is the cost that the private sector option should not exceed.\nJ. Support for, and by Government\n1. Support for Government\nIt is not uncommon for government officers to be ill-prepared when facing private sector\nnegotiators across the table. Often the private group will have world-class lawyers, financial advisers,\nand technical experts. By contrast the government side will often have no prepared business case,\nnor have access to specialists in the fields which PSP requires.\nPerhaps, surprisingly, this is not welcomed by the prospective concessionaire, because\nthe negotiations are unlikely to be effective, and may be prolonged, or fail for no good reason other\nthan that the government side have no informed basis from which to negotiate.\nA major improvement can be made in the PSP process if government technocrats are able\nto access such advice to prepare projects for PSP, at bidding and during negotiations. There are\nsome excellent examples of how this can be done:\na. Example: Philippines BOT Center\nIn 1995, a BOT Center was established under the Office of the President, with the United\nStates Agency for International Development funding assistance to fast-track the BOT process.\nThis is small (25 staff in total, with 5 consultants on average), and focuses on:\n\u2022 Assisting line agencies prepare projects - assistance to the BOT Units in the line\nagencies, such as DPWH.\n\u2022 Assisting them negotiate by providing specialist expertise, e.g., in legal and project finance\naspects.\n\u2022 Marketing projects internationally to potential investors.\n\u2022 Developing changes to the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the BOT Law.\nIn the roads sector, this has been effective. It could be more effective if funding was available\nfor agencies to prepare projects for joint public-private funding. This is currently under consideration\nas part of an ADB project preparatory TA.", "124\n2. Support by Government\nSometimes, once the concession agreement is signed, the government stands back. Yet\nactive government support is essential for the following reasons:\n\u2022 Government needs to fulfill its requirements under the contract - particularly in respect\nto acquiring land free of encumbrances and securing the necessary permissions. It\nalso needs to provide the support defined in the contract.\n\u2022 The road is an instrument of public policy, (to improve accessibility, open up areas for\ndevelopment etc.). The more effective the government support, the greater the project\nbenefits are likely to be - and the more successful the project. This should be a \u2018win-win\u2019\nsituation, benefiting road users, government (through profit-sharing arrangements) and\nthe concessionaire; but only rarely is this so.\n\u2022 This is particularly necessary to integrate an expressway into the road network, and\nensure that its competitive position is not undermined by other projects. Action is often\nnecessary away from the expressway site to secure good access to the expressway,\nand only government can do this.\n\u2022 Government must deliver on its committed reviews/increases in tariffs, on which the\nfuture project finances depend.\nTable 21 establishes whether political intervention has occurred in the toll and competition\narrangements after the concession agreement for toll roads has been finalized. It illustrates clearly\nthat either government underestimates the pressures that will arise in practice, or that contracts\nare entered into somewhat cynically. It seems that the government has little incentive to abide by\nagreements once the facility is in place.\nTable 21: Did the Agreed Price and Competition Policy Prevail?\n   Country                                         No           Yes\nArgentina Toll rate reduced\nMexico But a black market in toll receipts\ndeveloped\nAustralia Toll increases have been\npermitted\nUS Toll rates were lowered where\ntraffic was low (Dulles Greenway)\nIndia Riots led to the removal of tariffs\nSouth Africa Local politicians agreed to improve a parallel free road\nHungary Despite legal challenges toll levels\nhave not changed, but government\nwants local traffic to avoid the tolls\nPhilippines No toll increases between 1983 and 1994\nHong Kong, Cross Harbour Tunnel increases not permitted (tax New Toll Stability Fund approach\nChina imposed for congestion control).

BEST PRACTICES\nA. Best Practices\n1. Introduction\na. Need for a Process\nDeveloping a pipeline of PSP projects in the road sector requires government to\ndetermine a process, which comprises the following activities, at two different levels.\n\u2022 Sector Level:\n- Preparing the PSP environment \u2013 legal, regulatory, and contractual.\n- Identifying PSP projects in the context of a transport strategy and the realistic level\nof public sector support necessary, both investment and contingent investment.\n\u2022 Project Level:\n- Preparing a business case for each project, to establish the basis for bidding, and\nconfirm this is acceptable to government.\n- Securing competitive bids and negotiating leading to bid award.\n- Providing support and enforcing the concession agreement during construction.\n- Enforcing the concession agreement and regulating effectively during the concession\nperiod.\nThe economic crisis has reinforced on governments the need for increased transparency\nin the PSP process, and increased rigor in project preparation since they are now faced with a\nbetter informed, and more cautious investment community. Governments are likely to need\nassistance until this demanding process is established both at the roads sector level and more\ngenerally in structuring the PSP environment.\n2. The PSP Environment\na. Country Conditions\nNot everywhere is suited to PSP, and particularly to major BOT projects. PSP is likely to be\nfavored in countries where there is:\n\u2022 Political leadership and commitment to a PSP policy.\n\u2022 Political stability.", "                                                               126\n\u2022 An existing income level which is not low - and preferably an income distribution which\nis equitable.46\n\u2022 A sound macro-economy, creating increasing output and real income growth.\n\u2022 Low and stable inflation.\n\u2022 A stable exchange rate.\n\u2022 Domestic capital markets capable of providing domestic financing.\n\u2022 A program of concession projects builds private sector confidence, and allows\ngovernment and the private sector to spread the learning-curve costs.\nThe absence of any one of these features may not kill the prospects for PSP, but a country\nlacking the second or third will likely struggle to introduce effective PSP.\nb. Project Characteristics\nSome types of projects are more likely to be capable of implementation and financing.\nBroadly speaking the implementation and financing challenge increases with the size and complexity\nof the PSP option (Figure 5) and the challenge for government increases similarly.\nFor many countries the entry route into PSP in roads should be through maintenance and\noperating concessions. This allows the private sector and government to become familiar with\nperformance-based contracting, and offers the prospect of tackling the maintenance and\nrehabilitation problems, common in countries.\nThe focus of most countries to date has however been BOT expressways. Many of these\nhave not been financial successes. The characteristics favoring private financing of major BOT\nexpressways are as follows:\n\u2022 Projects down existing heavily-trafficked/congested corridors, or where there are missing\nlinks in the network, e.g., estuarial crossings or tunnels. This maximizes traffic prospects\non opening, and minimizes land/relocation costs.\n\u2022 Inter-urban, as opposed to urban projects. This keeps the implementation problems\nand cost relatively low, reduces the traffic risk, and is likely to be effective in tackling\ntraffic congestion.\n\u2022 Elevated or preferably at-grade alignments in cities, and at-grade construction for\ninterurban projects. This keeps construction costs low.\n\u2022 Projects in middle-income developing countries, preferably with an equitable income\ndistribution. Here the willingness-to-pay tolls and the prospects for traffic growth exist.\n46 This is important because as country\u2019s income increases, project benefits and revenues increase proportionately, but costs\nmuch less so. The result is that project profitability increases, and the need for government support reduces. Conversely low-\nincome countries require substantial government support, yet are unlikely to be able to provide it rationally because other projects\nshould often have higher public investment priority. Where income distribution is equitable, car ownership and use increases.", "127\n\u2022 Tariffs close to revenue-maximizing, and with an appropriate tariff escalation formula\nthat allows potential revenues to be captured over time, for the main vehicle classes.\n\u2022 Projects with an existing income stream, e.g., from an existing estuarial crossing/tunnel,\nor an existing public sector expressway. This is hugely beneficial to financing.\n\u2022 A project that has been well prepared - in technical terms, in securing planning consents\nand in proving the feasibility of land acquisition, thereby reducing implementation risks.\n\u2022 A large project, which recognizes the high fixed bidding costs associated with BOT\nprojects.\n3. Preparing the PSP Environment\nPolitical leadership is essential. Institutions may need to be restructured, with the objectives\nof controlling the PSP process in the public interest, avoiding tendencies for corruption or empire\nbuilding, and creating a regulatory body, separate from vested sector interests.\nThe core requirements are:\n\u2022 Developing an acceptable PSP legal framework \u2013 the exact nature of which will be\ncountry specific.\n\u2022 Securing competition for the market. Government should identify good projects and\nthen subject those to competitive bidding (rather than the widespread existing practice\nof accepting unsolicited bids). Where unsolicited bids are accepted, they should be\nsubject to realistic competition.\n\u2022 Securing competition in the market. This requires:\n- Legally-binding concession agreements which clearly set out the rights and\nobligations of all parties, and the procedures to be followed in the event of unforeseen\nevents.\n- Establishment of an autonomous and independent regulator which is also\naccountable. This is likely to be in government, but quite separate from vested sector\ninterests.\n- Encouragement of user-groups maybe empowered through an ombudsman function,\nto exert pressure on infrastructure providers.\n\u2022 Granting concessions only after government has determined they are clearly in the\npublic interest, and can be revoked if this is not met.\nMulti-lateral support for government is likely to be beneficial in implementation. A model that\nhas worked well combines a multi-sector PSP Center with PSP cells in the main line agencies.\nThe main PSP Center has the brief to assist line agencies prepare, market and negotiate projects,\nand is staffed accordingly.", "128\n4. Identifying PSP Projects\nThis is a government function, which must take place in the right institutional setting if the\nresults are to be accepted and implemented.\n47\nPriority projects must be identified in the context of a transport (or roads) strategy , in a\ntwo-stage process.\na. Prepare Transport (or Roads) Strategy\nThis is required to:\n\u2022 Be acceptable, which means that all affected stakeholders should be involved in its\npreparation.\n\u2022 Identify the package of policies and priority projects which best promote development\nobjectives, given an assessment of existing problems and available future public funds.\n\u2022 Specifically, highlight those projects/programs which may be implemented under PSP\narrangements, having regard to strategy objectives and the range of PSP options\navailable.\nTable 22:        The PSP Options\n         Strategy Objective Maintenance Turkey Maintain & ROT BOT Corridor\nOperate Management\nNew Source of Funds \u00d6 \u00d6 \u00d6 \u00d6\nMajor capacity increase (New Road) \u00d6 \u00d6\nImproved Maintenance \u00d6 \u00d6 \u00d6 \u00d6\nRehabilitation of existing roads \u00d6\n47  A transport strategy is normally required for cities, and inter-urban corridors where modal competition can be effective", "129\n5. Identify Priority PSP Projects\nGovernment must prepare feasibility studies, which will allow it to commit to specific projects.\nAgain, the institutional setting is central to achieving acceptability, and requires the participation of\nthe key stakeholders. This form of feasibility study requires:\n\u2022 A focus on optimizing the project specification, and delivering a project with robust\ncharacteristics. Specifically, the potential of the project to promote development, social\nand environmental objectives as well as economic efficiency should be addressed.\n\u2022 Tariff policy should be set in the light of government objectives.\n\u2022 A focus on implementability and financing.\n\u2022 A scope including all those activities which affect government\u2019s decision as to\nwhether to go ahead (technical, economic, financial, institutional, legal and land).\n6. Preparing the Business Case\nThis is required to confirm the decision to let the project, and identify the terms of the\nbidding in the knowledge of the likely market response; hence contact with potential bidders is\nnecessary. This in-depth analysis should:\n\u2022 Establish the project financial structure.\n\u2022 Identify the nature and scale of all the project risks.\n\u2022 Define the balance between government support and provisions (such as defined tariffs)\nto secure specific government objectives.\n\u2022 Allocate risks between government and the concession company. Experience suggests\nthe following is likely to be appropriate at a general level.\nTable 23:           Risk Allocation\n                          Risk    Responsibility of the     Responsibility of\n          Government Concession Company\nCompletion\n\u2022 Land Acquisition/permissions                  \u00d6\n\u2022 Design                \u00d6\n\u2022 Constrution time/cost                    \u00d6\nCommercial \u2013 operations and maintenance cost                \u00d6\nCommercial \u2013 Traffic Revenue Joint, government sharing in \u2018super-profits\u2019, and providing\ndownside guarantees48\nFinancing (government support) Agreed with the banks\n                 \u00d6\nDevaluation and Inflation                  \u00d6\nDefault and Forse Majeure\n\u2022 By Concession Company                \u00d6\n\u2022 By Government                  \u00d6\n48  This is likely to be particularly necessary for projects on green-field sites.", "130\n\u2022 Define the provisions for unforeseen events and specify the procedures for renegotiation.\n\u2022 Confirm that the proposed allocation of risks and government support are likely to attract\nserious bids.\nGovernment should not normally be an equity holder in the project company, as the parties\nhave different interests. Rather, the concession agreement should foster common views, by revenue\nsharing and provision for project extensions.\n7. Securing Competitive Bids, Negotiation, and Award\nThe basis for bidding follows directly from the business case. International marketing to\npotential investors may be necessary to maximize market interest. Success in attracting serious\nbidders requires the existence of an acceptable PSP process, realism in the balance of risks and\nrewards offered, confidence in the government resulting from its past performance, and good\ntiming given the external macro-economic environment.\nIt is necessary to establish a clear bidding and negotiating process:\n\u2022 The project requirements need to be specified closely, to ensure evaluation of bids can\nbe equitable.\n\u2022 Government support should be defined, where necessary as a maximum - rather then\nheld back for negotiation. This allows the private sector to prepare realistic bids, and\nhelps avoid failed bids.\n\u2022 Government should have access to expert advice during the entire process, from\npreparation of bid documentation through to contract signature. The private sector will\nhave such advice and governments need to be equally well-prepared.\n\u2022 There is merit in having simple evaluation criteria - for example, bidding at defined tariffs\nto minimize the level of government investment required since it gives transparent\ndecisions.\n\u2022 Conforming and non-conforming bids should be allowed, to foster private sector\ninnovation.\nGovernment should establish whether and to what extent PSP projects achieve value-for-\nmoney, by comparing costs with the best public sector alternative. Government should also seek\nto establish, through before-and-after audits, how expectations are matched by reality - as a basis\nfor continuous improvements to the PSP process.\n8. Supporting Implementation and Operations\nGovernment should be proactive during this period, with the objective of maximizing the\nsuccess of the project. Government will administer the concession contract, and regulate on an\nagreed basis in the public interest. When unforeseen circumstances occur, government must\nfollow the procedures set out in the concession agreement.", "131\nB. Role for ADB and Prospects\n1. Role for ADB\nThere is widespread recognition by government technocrats and private sector players,\nthat ADB needs to be increasingly involved in this area. Government because they require technical\nassistance in restructuring and reshaping of policy, as well as in funding and other support; and the\nprivate sector because they require technical assistance support to secure financing arrangements\nor appreciate that ADB assistance can help government to determine sector policy. This offers\nencouragement for ADB\u2019s continued role in supporting PSP. Table 24 summarizes the potential\nrole for ADB in sector activities identified in this study as priority for the coming five years. There are\nfive areas for ADB assistance as follows:\na. Preparing the Environment and Procurement Process for PSP\nADB is active here, and has been so for some years. The requirement is to extend that\nassistance now when it is clearly required and can reap substantial benefits.\nb. Broadening Understanding of the Range of PSP Options that exists\nin the Roads Sector.\nMost PSP options are currently not applied in Asia, and they provide an undoubted\nopportunity, as experience elsewhere demonstrates. In particular, they tackle the problems of\nmaintenance and rehabilitation, which underlie the problems of the roads sector in most\ncountries.\nc. Assisting Transport Strategy Formulation.\nThis is necessary for identifying priority PSP projects within an integrated transport sector\nframework. Policy dialogue and coordination with the World Bank and JBIC is necessary. Together\nwith ADB, the three agencies are the major providers of assistance to Asia\u2019s governments in the\nroads sector. At a time of considerable change, it is particularly important that a consistent message\nis delivered.\nd. Assisting Preparation of Priority Projects.\nThe case study visits demonstrated that there is a role for ADB, recognized by the public\nand private sector alike, in assisting to prepare projects for implementation. This is beginning to\nhappen, and the message is that more is required. This should be done with regard to the range of\nPSP options available, and the difficulties in delivering public-private sector (so-called hybrid) projects\nat times of uncertainty. It is not yet clear how the different imperatives of ADB and the private sector\ncan best be combined, when faced with an uncertain environment. Experimentation is required to\nestablish how this is best achieved.", "132\nTable 24: Role for ADB\nAssist Create Effective PSP Environment\n\u2022 Legal\n\u2022 Regulatory/institutional\n\u2022 Contractual\nBroaden Understanding of the PSP Options\n\u2022 Identify PSP programs and appropriate PSP options.\nAssist Transport Strategy Formulation\n\u2022 Develop sound integrated transport strategy.\n\u2022 Identify priority projects.\nDevelop PSP Capabilities\n\u2022 Develop center(s) of PSP expertise\n\u2022 Establish Project Preparation Fund(s) to prepare PSP projects,\nand to access experts, both domestic and international for procurement.\nInvest in Projects\n\u2022 Catalyze financing for PSP projects.\ne. Investing in Projects\nThrough ADB\u2019s public and private sector windows, and where appropriate by providing\nguarantees (partial risk and partial credit). ADB both lends for a project under a sovereign\nguarantee, to assist in funding the public sector activities, and can also invest in equity and\nprovide debt on the private sector side. These activities are widely recognized to leverage\nsubstantial additional funds in projects that ADB has determined are sound investments and\nshould be continued and enhanced.\n2.

Introduction\nThe key features of the Philippines experience are:\n\u2022 An early start in the private provision of roads.\n\u2022 An exclusive focus on build-operate-transfer (BOT) expressways \u2014 though none are\nyet open.1\n\u2022 A strong focus on the legal arrangements for private sector involvement.\n\u2022 The importance of the unsolicited bid.\n\u2022 The dominance of Metro Manila.\nThe power crisis at the turn of this decade was the origin of the current BOT process in the\nPhilippines. During the administration of President Ramos (1992-1998) Government policy has\nincreasingly centered upon mobilizing the effective participation of the private sector in service\ndelivery, to assist the Philippines in competing for business in globalized markets. This policy\nthrust is at the center of the next National Development Plan (1998-2004). The early thrust in the\npower sector has broadened, and now transport is a major part of the BOT program.\nIn the roads sector the North and South Luzon expressways (linking Manila with the north\nand south of Luzon Island) were constructed under World Bank loan assistance almost 30 years\nago. An operating franchise was awarded under the Toll Regulatory Board (TRB) Law to a private\ncontractor Construction and Development Corporation of the Philippines (CDCP) who were required\nto levy tolls, and maintain the roads \u2014 until the capital cost was amortized. Following losses in the\nMiddle East, CDCP became a predominantly publicly-owned company, now renamed Philippine\nNational Construction Corporation (PNCC). Recently, tolls were removed and the roads reverted to\nGovernment, but because of a failure to maintain them, a further franchise was given to PNCC to\ncollect tolls for maintenance.\n1    Subsequently the first short section of Skyway has opened.", "Appendix 1, page 2\nThe original PNCC franchise has a major impact upon the roads sector to this day, for it\nreferred to the named expressways together with links between them, extensions to them, and\nlinks to them. In practice, while open to interpretation, this includes many of Manila\u2019s proposed toll\nroads, and each new road effectively extends the original franchise for another 30 years. Another\nfranchise was awarded to the Public Estates Authority (PEA) for the development of an expressway\nacross reclamation in Manila Bay.\nThis history explains the twin-track legislative basis to expressway development in the\nPhilippines:\n\u2022 Joint ventures with PNCC or PEA under the TRB Law.\n\u2022 Competitive bids (either solicited or unsolicited) under the BOT Law.\n2. Legislative and Institutional Framework\nThe Manila North and South Expressways were funded and implemented by Government\n(under World Bank loan assistance). Subsequently, under the Marcos administration in 1977:\n\u2022 Presidential Directive 1112 established TRB. The Directive authorized \u201cthe Establishment\nof Toll facilities on Public Improvements, Creating a Board for the Regulation Thereof\nand for Other Purposes\u201d. TRB was required to approve all toll rates, following public\nhearings.\n\u2022 Then under Presidential Directive 1113, CDCP (a major Filipino contractor) was granted\na 30 year franchise to operate, construct and maintain toll facilities in the North and\nSouth Luzon expressways.\nIn 1983, the predominantly government-owned successor to CDCP2 PNCC, was granted a\n30-year franchise to construct and operate a tolled expressway linking the North and South\nExpressways. The franchise also gave it \u201cthe right, privilege and authority to construct, maintain\nand operate any and all such extensions, linkages or stretches from any of these expressways.\u201d\nA first BOT law was passed in 1990 and a second \u201cthe Amended BOT Law\u201d (Republic Act\n7718) in 19943 Clear and comprehensive implementing rules and regulations accompanied the\nsecond law. Figure A1.1 summarizes the process.\n2 CDCP suffered severe financial difficulties and was rescued by several government agencies. Today the successor\nPNCC is 90 percent publicly-owned by these agencies.\n3 An Act amending sections of Republic Act 6957 entitled \u2018An Act Authorising the Financing, Construction, Operation\nand Maintenance of Infrastructure Projects by the Private Sector, and for Other Purposes\u2019.", "Appendix 1, page 3\nFigure A1 .1: Philippines - The Public Bidding Process Under the BOT Law\nPrivate Sector      Government  Time Frame\nPROJECT ID &\nPREPARATION\n30 WORKING DAYS (40 DAYS)\nAPPROVAL BY\nAPPROPRIATE BODY\nDISAPPROVED\nSTOP OR IF WARRANTED\nAPPROVED PROPOSAL IS RECOMMENDED FOR\nNATIONAL GOVERNMENT FUNDING\nADVERTISE ONCE EVERY WEEK FOR 3\nADVERTISEMENT/\nCONSECUTIVE WEEKS (21 DAYS)\nINVITATION TO\nPrepares PQ Ducuments\nPREQUALIFY (PQ) & BID\nBIDDERS ARE GIVEN 30-45 DAYS TO SUBMIT\nPQ DOCUMENTS FROM LAST DATE OF ADVERTISEMENT\nSubmits PQ Documents PREQUALIFICATION\nOF BIDDERS 30 DAYS TO REVIEW PQ DOCUMENTS FROM\nLAST DATE OF ADVERTISEMENT INCLUDING\nNOTIFICATION OF PREQUALIFIED BIDDERS\nPrepares Bid Documents\nPRE-BID CONFERENCE/\nBID PREPARATION 90 TO 120 DAYS TO PREPARE BID PROPOSAL\nSubmits Bid Proposal &\nRECEIPT AND 1 DAY FOR BID SUBMISSION\nBid Bond\nOPENING OF BIDS\n30 DAYS EACH FOR TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL BID\nEVALUATION OF BIDS\nEVALUATION (60 DAYS)\n(2 ENVELOPE SYSTEM)\nDECISION TO AWARD - 30 DAYS FROM DATE OF\nCONTRACT AWARD\nCOMPLETION OF FINANCIAL EVALUATION\nSUBMISSION OF AGENCY TO ICC WITHIN 7 DAYS FROM DATE THE\nDECISION TO AWARD CONTRACT WAS MADE\nNEDA-ICC CLEARANCE ICC TO ACT ON THE CONTRACT WITHIN 15 WORKING DAYS (20 DAYS)\nReceives notice of award OF CONTRACT AGENCY SHALL APPROVE NOTICE OF AWARD (NOA) WITHIN 7\nDAYS AFTER ICC\u2019s CLEARANCE\nSigns contract after compliance ISSUANCE OF NOTICE OF AWARD TO WINNING BIDDER SHALL BE 7 DAYS\nwith all conditions of the CONTRACT FROM DATE OF APPROVAL OF NOA\ncontract/Posts APPROVAL CONTRACT EXECUTION SHOULD BE WITHIN 7 DAYS FROM RECEIPT OF\nPerformance Bond (NOA)/ APPROVAL OF CONTRACT SHALL BE WITHIN 15 DAYS FROM\nCOMPLIANCE WITH ALL CONDITIONS/FOR CONTRACT AWARD\nImplements Project CONTRACT FRANCHISE SHALL BE AUTOMATICALLY GRANTED.

In this event the original proponent has the right to match the competing\nprice, in which case he proceeds with implementation.\n- TRB issues a tolling certificate before approval is given. DPWH is then responsible\nfor implementation issues.\nIn 1995, a BOT center was established under the Office of the President, with the United\nStates Agency for International Development funding assistance to fast-track the BOT process.\nThis is small (25 staff in total, with 5 consultants on average), and focuses on:\n\u2022 Assisting line agencies prepare projects - to the BOT Units in line agencies such as\nDPWH.\n\u2022 Marketing projects internationally to potential investors.\n\u2022 Assisting them to negotiate with bidders by providing specialist expertise.\n\u2022 Introducing changes to the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the BOT Law.\nA corresponding BOT Unit has also been established within DPWH to take the lead in the\nroads sector.\nTRB is required to approve toll rates from competitive bids (although approval ought to be\nautomatic in this case), to negotiate toll rates with joint ventures after holding public hearings,\n4\nThe NEDA-ICC has Cabinet-level attendance, and the following representation and associated roles: NEDA chair,\nDPWH the line agency, Ministry of Finance MOF involved only if government guarantees are sought, DBM -allocates\ncounterpart funding, e.g., for land acquisition.", "Appendix 1, page 5\nto approve toll increases also after public hearings, and to oversee construction/implementation of\njoint-venture projects. The President holds final decision-making power however and can reverse\nTRB decisions to increase rates. TRB has more than 100 staff. However between 1983 and 1996\nthere were no toll increases at all.\nAll projects are required to have an Environmental Impact Assessment, which is to be\napproved by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. This process does sometimes\ninfluence the project definition. Relocation and resettlement issues are a particularly big problem\nfor major projects in the Philippines, and this is particularly true in Metro Manila.\n3. Project Identification\nAll the identified expressways are in the Greater Capital Area \u2014 an area within 100kms of\nMetro Manila, either in the city, or on the radial intercity roads emanating from it.\nHence, there is a development plan but it does not yet have a major influence on land use.\nThere is a transport strategy for the city but it does not yet have a mechanism for addressing the\nissues of priority for particular projects and project identification. This creates two common problems\nin practice:\n\u2022 Project identification often takes place in a network vacuum \u2014 this means that there is\na lack of provision for integration between roads and many strategically important linkages\nare missing from the network.5\n\u2022 Good projects are pre-empted by the development of others, which may have less\neconomic merit. For example, many of the projects in Metro Manila are for new\nexpressways along radials into the center of Manila. Typically this prevents the\nconstruction of good public transport connections in those corridors when in fact, the\npublic transport option might be more appropriate. Once developed, these projects have\na high opportunity cost since they frustrate future strategy.\n4. Results of the Process: Projects\n\u2022 Table Al .1 summarizes the characteristics and status of BOT expressway projects in\nthe Philippines.\n\u2022 There are no BOT expressways operational at present.6\n\u2022 Five are under construction: Skyway  [CITRA]; Manila-Cavite [Renong]; North Luzon\nExpressway [BENPRES]; South Luzon Expressway (SLE) [Hopewell]; Southern Tagalog\nArterial Road (STAR) [CITRA].\n\u2022 Of these one has been competitively bid. This was successful:\n- Evaluation was on the basis of the criterion: lowest toll rate. This simplicity assisted\nthe evaluation.\n5 The same is true for Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) project, which sometimes conflict with proposed expressways.\n6 This was the case at the time of the visit in April 1998, other than a short section (8 km) of the Subic Expressway.\nSince then a short section of Skyway has opened. In October 1996 the toll per car-km was increased from P0.18 to\nP0.30.", "Appendix 1, page 6\n- The winning rate was P0.7/car-km, compared with the government estimate of\n1.25 c/car-km.7\nTable A1 .1: Philippines: BOT Project Characteristics\nCost\nProject Status US$bn8 Project Contract\nMetro Manila Construction 0.4 Existing 15km JV PNCC with CITRA Indonesia &\nSkyway expressway to be tolled CMMTC.\nStage 1 (P22/$O.55 for cars), with   . .\n9km expressway Taking over existing tolled road gives\nconstructed above and substantial guarantees & support\ntolled (P55/$1.38 for cars)\nOriginated in 1992 United States\nAgency for International\nDevelopment feasibility study\nMetro Manila Planning 0.9 21km As stage 1\nSkyway\nStages 2,3\nManila Cavite Construction 0.3 l0kms at-grade xpwy JV Public Estates Authority with\nExpressway along coastal road Renong (Malaysia)\n6km link to C5 Potential support from development\nPhilippines not clear 0.4 16km elevated JV PNR with New San Jose Builders\nNational expressway over PNR\nRailway right-of-way, with low\n(PNR) income housing attached\nPabahay Sa\nRiles Tollway\nR10/ C3  Planning 0.1 7km elevated BOT.

Conclusions and Comments\nThe Philippines has made huge strides in attracting private sector funding. After\nearly success in the power sector, implementation of expressways is taking place, with a\npipeline of identified projects. Strong political purpose has resulted in a BOT Law that has\nsecured substantial confidence in the investment community. This has been achieved in a\nrelatively short time \u2014 less than a decade.\nFigure A1.2: Philippines Expressways - Luzon\nFigure A1.3: Expressways - Metro Manila\nNLE EXNORTH LUZON EAST\nNLE EXTN.

This has meant that priority projects are not always identified and\nthere has been inter-project and inter-agency conflict.\n\u2022 The need for privately-funded expressways is primarily driven by a small public investment\nbudget (\u2018there is no alternative\u2019). There has been no discussion of the use of tolling\nstrategy as a matter of transport policy to improve efficiency of resource allocation, to\npromote social equity etc.\n\u2022 The absence of investment in project preparation. Project preparation is important since\nit maximizes the participation of the private sector and allows project implementation to\nproceed with predictable consequences.12 However, in the Philippines, Government\nhas often tended to be reactive, and little is yet done to prepare projects for private/\npublic implementation.\n\u2022 The failure to recognize the valid use of public support to secure the non-user benefits\nof expressways. The assumption is that expressways are profitable. Typically, however,\nexpressways are only profitable if they have access to an external revenue stream or\ngovernment support in one form or another.\n\u2022 Local government opposition to national government plans. This has been particularly\nproblematic for land acquisition.\n\u2022 An absence of competition in contract award. In the case of the PNCC and PEA joint\nventure projects, there is no competitive bidding.

This is in spite of the fact that the BOT Law transferred TRB to\nDPWH. This is partly a matter of jurisdiction (the focus of technical regulation\nactivities) and partly of personalities and history. It is a serious problem, frustrating\nthe process.\n\u2022 Government cannot provide guarantees under the unsolicited bidding route, meaning\nthat it cannot make payments direct to banks. But if the payment is via the private sector\ninterest it seems this circumvents the intent of the rule.\nMany of these issues are recognized in Government, and steps are in place to remedy\nthem, thus further improving the process:\n\u2022 The just-completed major thrust of TA 2487-PHI: Philippine Transport Strategy Study\nwas to secure private sector participation in the public interest.\n\u2022 The current Bank TA 2968-PHI: Transport Infrastructure and Capacity Development\nProject is assisting Government in this area, and identifying a possible loan to\nprovide ongoing support.\n\u2022 Improvements to the BOT process are being considered by NEDA-ICC, with inputs\nfrom BOT Center. There is, however, a resistance to reducing the autonomy of individual\nagencies, and no great expectation that there will be a rapid reversion to competitive\nbidding under the BOT Law.", "Appendix 1, page 12\nInevitably government had to provide strong incentives to attract investors in the early days.\nThis has now been done. Once achieved there is concern that the balance of risks and rewards, if\nleft unchanged, may act against the public interest.

Pragmatism combined with continuous monitoring\nand recognition of this public interest provide a promising basis for the future development of policy.", "Appendix 1, page 13\nB. Malaysia\n1. Introduction\nThe key features of the Malaysian experience are:\n\u2022 The resounding success of the first project \u2014 the North-South Expressway (NSE).\n\u2022 A large number of projects both completed and in the pipeline.\n\u2022 Limited Government involvement in project identification.\n\u2022 The absence of transparent legal frameworks for private sector involvement.\n\u2022 The heavy involvement of domestic Banks.\n\u2022 The complication of multiple tolling technologies.\n\u2022 Financial difficulties for concessionaires, and hence Government, as the economy has\nfaltered in the late 1990s.\nKey to the Malaysian expressway experience is the first project in the sector: the NSE. This\nproject has influenced everything else. The road had originally been designed as a public sector\nproject and Government built the first third (335kms). In the mid-80s, the project was restructured\nas a BOT expressway. The existing road was transferred to PLUS,13 who were also given tolling\nrights over the whole road. Hence, during construction of the remainder of the road, between 1988\nand 1994, PLUS had a revenue stream from the first section. The whole project has had a huge,\npositive impact upon the economic and social geography of Malaysia, and has attracted rapidly\ngrowing traffic. It has had a profound impact on future BOT projects.\nIs the NSE profitable? Undoubtedly, it is for the project company. However, had it been a\nstand-alone project without the Government assets and their revenue stream, it would not be.\nMalaysian expressway development has happened over a relatively short time (the last ten\nyears). The results of the program are only now becoming clear. This concentrated period of project\ndevelopment has allowed no time in which to learn the lessons of experience. Financial problems\nfor some of the projects are now contributing to the shock waves in the economy. Many of the\nprojects relied on the property market for additional revenues and as that market weakens the\nknock on effects for expressways have become clear. Almost all of the projects now require some\nGovernment support.\nHow has this situation developed?\n\u2022 Contractor-led consortia have usually made large construction profits. (These are often\nsecured by appointing fixed-price sub-contracts to smaller companies.) This has been\nthe motivation of virtually all the players, Government and private sector. Hence, the\nconsortia have had little incentive to consider long run financial viability.\n\u2022 There has been no framework of transport policy, or national transport strategy. The\nresult has been that:\n- There is no basis to reject any proposal.\n- Projects have been developed in isolation from their network consequences.\n13  Part of the Renong Group.", "Appendix 1, page 14\n- Concessionaires have had little interest in the economic, environmental or social impacts\nof their project.\n\u2022 The Economic Planning Unit (EPU), which is part of the Prime Minister\u2019s office, controls\nthe process, rather than the Highway Planning Unit whose brief is restricted to government\nprojects. Hence the government has not always:\n- Ensured that each project is justified and a priority.\n- Ensured that the benefits of competition are realized. The typical route for developers\nis via the Prime Minister and a letter of intent and exclusivity from the EPU. This has\nruled out competition before the feasibility study stage.\n- Enforced the concession agreement in the public interest.\n\u2022 Where there has been competition for a well-prepared project it has been successful\n\u2014 attracting private sector interest, innovation and in all probability providing good value-\nfor-money. The key example of this was the Shah Alam Expressway project, which was\ntendered in 1991. Its concept had been developed by JBIC and subject to considerable\npreparation. The bidding period was extended three times from the initial three months,\nallowing bidders to develop innovative concepts. Gamuda were the winning bidder. Their\nbids saved MRl5Omn by avoiding filling in a mining pond -which meant that there was\nno need for a Government soft loan, changed the staging and took innovative funding\nadvice from Schroders. However this was unusual. For both the Kuala Lumpur (KL)\nNorth-East Expressway and the East Coast Expressway there were three groups\nbidding, and the government asked them to combine, removing effective competition. In\nthe case of the East Coast Expressway there has been no progress because of\ndifferences between the three.\n\u2022 There is no BOT Law providing the legislative basis for the system and little transparency\nin the system of project identification and procurement.\n\u2022 All debt tends to be domestic, and the banks, in practice, take no risk. The government\nguarantees the loans through the concession agreements. Thus it is the government\nthat takes the majority of the risk. The current financial crisis has highlighted the problems\nof this contingent liability for the government.\n\u2022 The project sponsors are often big infrastructure groups who may also have interests in\nthe banks. This substantially increases risk and reduces transparency.\n\u2022 The typical debt: equity ratios are 4:1. This suggests that the banks should be carrying\nmajor risk, but in practice because of government support through the concession\nagreement, they are not. Therefore, they carry out little due-diligence work before deciding\nto invest.", "Appendix 1, page 15\n\u2022 One interesting aspect of this experience is (in marked contrast to most countries) the\nability of the private sector to implement projects which they identify. The private sector:\n- Plans the projects.\n- Identifies most projects\n- Designs\n- Implements.\n- Operates.\n2 Legislative and Institutional Framework\nThere is no BOT law. Rather, the system has usually operated in the following way:\n\u2022 A project is developed to a pre-feasibility level by a private group, who request a letter of\nexclusivity from EPU to develop the project EPU reviews the project concept and if the\nproject is approved, a letter of exclusivity is issued\n\u2022 The project is subject to full feasibility study, and a Privatization Proposal developed.\nThis is submitted to EPU for formal review EPU usually convenes a Technical and a\nFinancial Evaluation Committee, involving the appropriate line agencies.\n\u2022 Concessionaires may proceed to detailed design in expectation of approval, in\nparallel with negotiation of the concession agreement. This may take 3-9 months.\nIt typically costs RM 3 million-RM 4 million (US$1 million) to complete this process.\nDepartment of the Environment approval is required for an Environmental Impact Assess-\nment and in some cases this has influenced projects. Relocation and particularly squatters are\noften a particular problem and here the private sector has sometimes assisted the Government.\nFor example, PLUS seconded staff to assist with land acquisition for the NSE.\nA key issue facing the private sector promotion of projects which are not subject to govern-\nment preparation, is that there is no basis on which to compare the projects, as each bid has\ndifferent characteristics. Other issues arise from the competing technologies among the different\ndevelopers. For example, Renong uses the infra-red tolling technology, and Gamuda the micro-\nwave system.\nMany different government agencies are involved in the process. The Malaysian Highways\nAuthority signs the concession agreement, and is responsible for technical regulation; while eco-\nnomic regulation is the remit of EPU and the Cabinet \u2014 who need to approve toll increases (even\nwhen their basis may be defined unambiguously in the concession agreement).", "Appendix 1, page 16\nEPU has defined some clear policies for the sector:\n\u2022 There should always be a parallel free road.\n\u2022 Public transport should be encouraged to use expressways. Thus tariffs on buses are\nlower than for cars. This is an innovative approach to promoting social equity.\n\u2022 Motorcycles have separate tracks, engineered into the design, along the Federal Road\n1. This reflects the large number of motorcycles, which are used by low/middle income\npeople and also contribute to social equity.\nTariffs are derived from the concessionaires bid and negotiations, based on EPU\u2019s view\nof an acceptable rate of return (currently 15 percent IRA). They are therefore based upon the\nneed to repay the cost, rather than on transport policy objectives. Tolls are all per - kilometer\nbased. NSE tariffs have, in practice, set the benchmark and they were guaranteed an increase of\n6 percent per annum resulting in a real increase when inflation was low. Toll rates for taxis and\nbuses do not rise. Current car tariffs are 10.5 sen/km (US2.8 cents/km). Recently government\nrefused the application for an \u2018automatic\u2019 6 percent increase. This came at a difficult time\neconomically - with widespread resistance to toll increases, and discussions are ongoing about\ncompensation.\nThe Shah Alam Expressway has the following tolls:\n\u2022 RM 1/car at each of the tollbooths on the 17km open section.\n\u2022 RM 1/car to be charged at the single tollbooth on the 18km extension.\n\u2022 Tolls increase to RM1.20 in January 1999 and RM1.60 in 2001 \u2013  resulting in a guaranteed\nincrease of 6 percent every 2 years.\n\u2022 Medium goods vehicles and heavy goods vehicles are charged RM1 .5 and RM2\nrespectively at each tollbooth (and RM2 and RM3 on the KL-Karak section).\n\u2022 Buses are charged 75 sen and taxis 50 sen at each toll barrier.\nIn the latest concession agreements the government is moving towards a system of:\n\u2022 Restricting increases to every 5 years.\n\u2022 Only allowing an increase when revenues are no higher than forecast at the time of the\nconcession agreement. This is part of government\u2019s effort to tilt the balance of reward\nback towards the government.\n3. Project Identification\nA national roads master plan was developed in the early 1980\u2019s and Kuala Lumpur transport\nstudy undertaken in the mid 1980\u2019s, and updated under JBIC funding in 1998.

Key points to note:\n\u2022 Malaysia has achieved much in terms of completed projects, with more under construction\nand in the pipeline.", "Appendix 1, page 21\n\u2022 Malaysia\u2019s private sector has shown - maybe uniquely, that it can \u2018make projects happen\u2019.\nThis is a substantial achievement. It is because of: (i) very strong commitment from the\ntop that this will happen; and (ii) large incentives to the private sector to carry out functions\nnormally carried out by government.\n\u2022 The Government has often not benefited from competition, nor has the investment\nbeen without substantial government support. The private sector has usually obtained\nhigh profits and avoided carrying significant risk. It is the public sector that has\ncarried most of the risk, and has a huge contingent liability - which is now being\nrealized.\n\u2022 There has been much innovation in projects and approaches, and a broad, adaptable\nindustry has been developed. Unfortunately the benefits of this experience are unlikely\nto be exportable on a significant scale.\n\u2022 There has been little economic or social evaluation of the program since privatized\nprojects are assumed to be in the public good and there has been little or no public\nparticipation.\n\u2022 Malaysia\u2019s privatization has been implemented under strong determination to benefit\nBumiputras, by creating large entrepreneurial conglomerates. The major beneficiaries\nhave been the project developers and the banks. The former have shown their ability to\ndevelop innovative project concepts, quickly and to make construction profits with\nfinancial innovation.\n\u2022 There has been little risk taking from banks, who have been protected by Government\nguarantee. Also, banks may be linked to the project developers, or acting under\ngovernment influence. The lack of risk has meant that the banks have often failed to\ncarry out appropriate due diligence.\n\u2022 Government has given support to assist project viability: land, soft loans \u2014 repayable\nafter commercial debt is repaid creating long-term finance, and traffic guarantees (on\nthe NSE).\n\u2022 Government does not provide foreign exchange guarantees, which have not been an\nissue because virtually all debt has been domestic. Until recently, foreign equity\ninvestment has not been allowed. Under liquidity problems this is happening, requiring\napproval on a case-by-case basis.\n\u2022 There is no transparent BOT or concessioning process, no BOT Law and no published\nprocedures.\n\u2022 Profits for the project developers come from construction and sometimes latterly from\nlisting the project on the KL Stock Exchange. This can be done for a large project\n(greater than RM500 million) before construction, based on projections. GAMUDA have\ndone this - the concept is that a first listing can be the vehicle for raising subsequent\nequity by rights issues or sale.\n\u2022 However, toll roads rarely make money without strong government support (in kind,\ninvestments and/or guarantees). This is a clear conclusion from this case study. It is\nestimated that only 2-3 out of the first 9 operational projects are profitable without such\nGovernment support.", "Appendix 1, page 22\nA conclusion may be that \u2014 as for Mexico \u2014 Malaysia has suffered from developing its\nnetwork too quickly. It is only recently, when the main batch of projects started opening, that\nGovernment realized the scale of their contingent liability.\nThis realization together with the impact of the economic crisis is now leading to change.\nMOF is now taking a more central role because of the need to fund the government liabilities. Bank\nNegara has not classified toll roads as priority projects but existing projects are being supported\nthrough restructuring of developers\u2019 debts. One key lesson has been that land and development\nprofits have provided an unsafe basis for project funding.\nBoth Government and the private sector see the need for assistance by ADB and other\nmulti-lateral lending institutions, and programs are being developed to provide that assistance. A\nnew chapter in Malaysian road privatization may be beginning.", "Appendix 1, page 23\nC. Thailand\n1. Introduction\nThe key features of the Thai experience are:\n\u2022 The dominance of Bangkok.\n\u2022 Institutional conflicts and lack of government planning.\n\u2022 Process difficulties, and a changing process.\n\u2022 The difficulty of terminating concession agreements that are not implemented.\n\u2022 Financial difficulties for concessionaires, and thereby for Government, as the economy\nhas faltered in the late 1990\u2019s.\nAll of Thailand\u2019s existing expressways are in the Bangkok area, or on radial routes\nconnecting to Bangkok. The conditions for successful expressways exist - high traffic flows,\nsevere traffic congestion, a poorly developed existing road network and relatively high and\nincreasing values of time.\nToday a network of expressways has been developed. The process of development has\nbeen difficult, with at least one project failing (Hopewell) and two others experiencing major contractual\nproblems \u2014 Second Stage Expressway and Don Muang Tollway.\nThe network has developed in phases, with the participation of several different government\nagencies. In the late 1970\u2019s, government developed the First-Stage Expressway System. In the\nlate 1980\u2019s government policy was \u2018private sector first\u2019 - and individual government agencies were\nencouraged to contract BOT expressway and mass transit projects. The Second Stage Expressway,\nDon Muang Tollway, and Hopewell were the first results; with other projects planned as BOT\nconcessions. These were not co-ordinated and almost all major corridors had megaprojects which\nconflicted with one another, often using the same airspace. The problems created at that time, still\ncause severe problems today.\nDuring the early 1990\u2019s, three significant events took place:\n\u2022 In 1993, the Anand Government introduced a law requiring compensation be paid for\nland, at market rates. This resulted in a huge increase in the Government cost of\nmegaprojects, with two results:\n- Conflict on the Second Stage Expressway leading to a collapse of the original\nshareholding in BECL umagai Gumi and foreign lenders were replaced by\nExpressway and Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (ETA) and Thai lenders].\nThis undermined the confidence of the international community that the\nGovernment could administer a legally-binding concession agreement.\n- Increasing institutional conflict between the two main agencies in the sector: ETA\nand the Department of Highways (DOH). Increasing land prices forced ETA to adopt\nexisting road alignments, to minimize land take. DOH own the rights-of-way of several\nroads and consider they should develop them. This remains a serious problem with\nthe agencies having sometimes developed \u2018competing\u2019 projects, creating difficulties\nand uncertainties.\n\u2022 A 1993 Royal Act created the current framework for private sector participation. This\nsought to ensure that government agencies did not, in future, unilaterally contract BOT\nconcession agreements; it applied to all large (>1 billion baht) projects.", "Appendix 1, page 24\n\u2022 About the same time the Cabinet decided that within a 25 square kilometer area of\ncentral Bangkok, all transit lines should be underground. After appeal, 2 of the 3 transit\nschemes with concession agreements were allowed to remain elevated. Although\nexpressways were not involved, the process caused uncertainty and difficulty given the\nnetwork of actual and proposed expressways and MRT lines.\nThe Thai economic crisis began in mid 1997. The chaotic process by which BOT projects\nhave developed may have been a contributory cause of that crisis. ADB15 is assisting the Thai\nGovernment to improve the current process.\n2. Legislative and Institutional Framework\nThere is no BOT Law and the existing BOT process is not yet regarded as fully\ntransparent.\nThe main Government agencies and their responsibilities are:16\n\u2022 The Ministry of Finance: provides government support (investment, guarantees) for\nprojects.\n\u2022 National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB): is under the Office of the\nPrime Minister and responsible for strategic infrastructure planning, but with no veto\nover projects.\n\u2022 DOH is under the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is responsible for\nnational highways.\n\u2022 ETA: is a state enterprise under the Ministry of Interior, responsible for new expressways.\n\u2022 Bangkok Metropolitan Administration: is responsible for metropolitan roads in Bangkok.\n\u2022 Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment: requires environmental impact\nassessments for major projects.\nThere is a history of institutional conflict, with decisions often being resolved at Cabinet\nlevel. ETA and DOH have separately and independently prepared expressway programs without\nco-ordination. It is around the periphery of Bangkok that the major conflicts arise with the first\nagency to construct tending to force a delay or change the plans of the other agency. ETA has not\nbeen involved outside the Bangkok region.\n15 TA 2353-THA: Private Sector Participation in Infrastructure Projects.\n16 In addition, the Public Works Department construct some roads: bridges and approach roads in Bangkok, secondary roads\noutside; but it cannot collect tolls.", "Appendix 1, page 25\nDOH has the authority to develop tolled expressways, under the recently amended\nHighway Concession Act. They have produced a national expressway network,17 which has the\nfollowing features:\n\u2022 It is national in scope - see Figure Al .5 and includes the Bangkok Region.\n\u2022 It is ambitious and is to be implemented over 20 years.\n\u2022 It comprises 4,l50kms of expressways.\n\u2022 Its cost is estimated in 1997 prices as US$13.4 billion.\n\u2022 It is to be implemented in its entirety as BOT concessions, with toll revenues used to\nfund the network. It is expected that this will be feasible without a massive\ngovernment commitment.\n\u2022 The first 5-year program was approved by Cabinet in April 1997, and comprised:\n- 11 motorway projects, 852 kms in length, costing Bt159 billion (US$4.2\nbillion@Bt38=$l).\n- seven of which have been subject to feasibility study.\n- two of which were considered to be ready for private sector participation.\nNo procurement strategy was announced for the new program. In the past, the Government\nhas provided guarantees on an ad hoc basis, depending on the project and the sponsors. This has\nmade it difficult for bidders, who may have had unrealistic expectations. In some cases evaluation\nhas taken place and the decision submitted to Cabinet for approval only to find that the Cabinet\nhave required the whole process to start again. Substantial delay and frustration has sometimes\nbeen the result.\nProjects developed under the Highway Concession Act will have:\n\u2022 A concession period of between 25 and 30 years, based on the expected financial rate\nof return.\n\u2022 A \u2018closed\u2019 toll system with specified toll rates:\n- Cars/4 wheels, 1 Bt/km, but 30 Bt minimum\n- Vehicles up to 6 wheels, 1 .6BtIkm, but 50Bt minimum.\n- Vehicles > 6 wheels, 2.3Bt/km, but 70Bt minimum.\n\u2022 There is no clear policy on toll rate increases, which is of concern to investors: \u2018the\nconcessionaire may from time to time request to adjust the toll rates so that they are\nfair to the company in light of changes in the economic situation\u2019.\n\u2022 Government support is to be considered at negotiation stage and assistance for land\nacquisition is promised. This too has undermined investor confidence.\n17  Proposed Inter-City Motorway Projects in the Kingdom of Thailand for Privatisation\u2019, by DOH, May 1998.", "Appendix 1, page 26\nAfter the early contracts, in which individual agencies signed contracts sometimes with no\ncompetition, e.g., Hopewell, most projects have involved competition. The procurement, however,\nhas not always been transparent, with charges of corruption sometimes cited as a reason for\ncontract award; and this has reinforced institutional conflict.\n3. Project Identification\nThailand is recognized as having particularly difficult institutional problems in the transport\nsector. This is particularly so in the Bangkok region. There appears to be no effective mechanism\nfor coordinating action, other than the Cabinet.\nThere has been no formal process for project identification. Symptoms of this problem\ninclude the following:\n\u2022 NESDB produce plans for the sector, but the agencies do not abide by these, and\nsometimes act in conflict with them.\n\u2022 Projects contracted in the early 1990\u2019s often appeared to contravene the public interest,\nbut serve institutional objectives. Thus, in the northern corridor 3 MRT projects and 3\nexpressways were contracted. While the national Seventh Plan argued against this,\nthe projects were unaffected, until the recent demise of Hopewell, which has left a\nlegacy of problems.\n\u2022 There has been little effective project co-ordination: the first project constructed \u2018wins\u2019\nin the battle for alignment. This affects the MRT system adversely, as well as the\nexpressways, when ETA and DOH have developed \u2018competing\u2019 projects in the same\ncorridor.\n\u2022 The projects are sometimes not optimized. MRT systems are required to be underground\n\u2014 presumably because of their visual impact \u2014 yet expressways, which are usually\nconsidered intrusive (since they are so much wider) continue to be built through the\nmiddle of the city.\n\u2022 The concentration of megaprojects down the main corridors fails to tackle one of\nBangkok\u2019s central problems - a poorly developed primary road network. This results in\nmassive megablocks undeveloped because they are inaccessible except via narrow,\nunconnected lanes (sois). Instead of opening up new corridors, the megaprojects are\nmostly perpetuating them. The increase in compensation payments to market rates\nhas markedly increased this tendency, encouraging Government to avoid costly land\nacquisition in favor of using existing rights-of-way.", "Appendix 1, page 27\n4.

Project Case Studies\na. Second-Stage Expressway System\nETA had completed conceptual designs when the project was to be implemented as a\npublic sector project. Consultant Freeman Fox, Kumagai Gumi, and CH Karnchang identified this\nas a promising BOT opportunity, and carried out the project development purposefully. They\nconcluded that Government support would be necessary. An unsolicited bid (from BECL) was then\nmade to ETA. It proposed that:\n\u2022 The project should be tendered, but to a tight timetable, limiting the effective competition.\n\u2022 A definite completion period, providing that in return ETA committed to a timetable for\nmaking land available for construction. If this date was not met, BECL would share\nequally in the revenues from the Government-operated First-Stage Expressway System,\nand continue to do so on an agreed basis.\nThe bid-to-award process took 18 months and the construction was implemented\npurposefully. On the point of opening, however, a dispute arose, with ETA insisting that it should\ncollect the tolls. The outcome was that foreign investors were replaced by Thai investors.\nSubsequently there have been problems of toll increases not being awarded when justified under\nthe contract, but, by and large, these have taken place.\nLand acquisition, while substantially accomplished, has proved intractable for section D\n(the road was to be built in sections), and this is unlikely to be completed.\nThe Second Stage Expressway tariff has set the precedent for other projects and is currently\n30 baht for cars. There is an electronic tolling system but it is little used.\nb. Don Muang Tollway\nUnder the agreement, Government was required to remove flyovers on the parallel road\nwhich competes with the tollroad, and the flyovers were instead to be re-constructed for orbital\nmovements. However, the Government delayed for more than two years and the Transport and\nCommunications Ministry would not allow toll increase (from 20 to 30 baht) until the flyovers were\ncompleted. The result was that the tollway collected only one-third of forecast revenues during that\nperiod. This lack of revenue meant that the sponsor was threatened with bankruptcy. Renegotiations\nled to Government compensation and an injection of Bt3 billion, giving Government a 40 percent\nstake in the concession company. From being a private project it has now become a quasi-\ngovernment one.\nThe Don Muang Tollway currently charges 20 baht for cars and 30 baht for 6-axle\nvehicles.\nc. Hopewell\nThe contract was awarded in 1990 by SRT/Ministry of Transport and Communications. It\ncalled for an integrated structure with grade-separated SRT railway tracks, an MRT system and an\nexpressway on the top level - extending a total of 60 kms to the north and east of Bangkok.", "Appendix 1, page 32\nFunding was to be from land development profits and the tolled expressway. The project\nconflicted with parallel projects under implementation, and \u2018froze\u2019 many other projects, because it\nhad access to all the land and air-rights above SRT.\nThe crash in the property market (which started several years ago), and the latest economic\ncrisis have seriously compounded the problems created by locating three expressways in a single\ncorridor. After 8 years of ineffective implementation the government has terminated the concession.\nIt is now left with a significant problem (what to do with partly-constructed elevated structures), no\nsolution for SRT, and no implementation of MRT on what has always been one of the best MRT\nalignments in Bangkok. The way to tackle these issues is currently being investigated.\n6. Conclusions and Comments\nBangkok\u2019s expressways support one firm conclusion: they do not solve traffic congestion.\nToday there is a network of expressways which is well-used, but results in huge congestion, often\non the expressways, and invariably when access to/from the expressways is required.\nOther lessons from Bangkok include the following:\n\u2022 A good procurement process is vital. In Bangkok, the absence of this has produced\nmassive delays, losses for participating private sector companies, and poor results.\n\u2022 In spite of expectations, expressways are often unprofitable. Second Stage Expressway\nand Don Muang Tollway - two apparently very good projects - have both required major\nGovernment investment.\n\u2022 Land profits are unsafe as a basis for funding - the abandonment of Hopewell is one\nexample.\n\u2022 Planning is necessary. Government agencies undertook identification in Bangkok, but\nthere was little co-ordination between them. The conflicts have caused major problems.\n\u2022 Letting concessions has a high opportunity cost when they are not implemented. They\nhave proved very difficult to terminate, even when they directly conflict with each other.\nWhen the networks of expressways and MRT projects are large, this creates a straight\njacket, severely constraining Government action.\n\u2022 Investors, both foreign and domestic, have often been deterred from bidding by a\ncombination of a perception of lack of transparency and corruption in contract award,\nand an inability to administer legally-binding contracts.\n\u2022 Land costs have made projects more and more costly to government - partly as a\nresult of increasing prices, and partly as a result of paying proper compensation. This\nmakes projects increasingly difficult to justify, and reinforces the need for prioritization.\nThe recent crisis has lead ETA to focus on completion of ongoing projects, and the\ndeferring of new projects. The crisis provides Government with a window of opportunity, which\nan ADB technical assistance grant is now addressing. It has recommended the following action,\nand discussions are ongoing with Government to comprehensively overhaul the concession\nprocess:", "Appendix 1, page 33\n\u2022 A statement of Government policy for private sector participation in infrastructure would\nclarify policy and identify/allocate risks to be borne by government and the private sector\non a mandatory compliance basis.\n\u2022 Require mandatory compliance with the NESDB medium/long-term plans and the\nnational 5-Year Plan by all government agencies.

Introduction\nThe key features of the Hong Kong, China experience are:\n\u2022 The effectiveness of government planning.\n\u2022 The effectiveness of a transparent bidding processes.\n\u2022 The need for a tariff policy on government-tolled facilities.\n\u2022 The use of different mechanisms for private sector involvement.\n\u2022 The problems of competition in tolling technologies.\n\u2022 Innovatory mechanisms for establishing the toll rate.\n\u2022 Under-use of costly transport infrastructure.\nFor Hong Kong, China, the core objectives of private funding have been to release\nGovernment resources for other purposes, and early implementation. Implementation is swifter\nunder private management than Government, and hence road users benefit from the new\ninfrastructure sooner.\nAll projects to date have been bid on the basis that under the terms of the bid toll and\nancillary revenues will create profitable projects. There has been no consideration of negative\nconcessions \u2014 in which the government explicitly provides support for unprofitable but economically\nimportant roads.\nUnlike the rest of Asia, Hong Kong, China has not only involved the private sector in BOT\nprojects, but also in management contracts for Government tunnels, and latterly in a maintenance\nmanagement contract for the Tsing Ma Control Area.\n2. Legislative, Institutional and Financial Framework\nHong Kong, China has \u2018learned by doing\u2019. Its first BOT project was opened in 1972, with\nsubsequent projects in 1989, 1991, 1997, and 1998. This has allowed the BOT process to be\ncontinuously improved.\nThe involvement of the private sector in infrastructure provision is not forced by funding\nimperatives, and the case for PSP is less compelling than it might be, given the absence of\ninefficiency of the bureaucracy. Rather, the Hong Kong, China view is that the private sector should\nbe used where it can best deliver services and that where this is not possible, Government should\nbe made more efficient - e.g., through creating government corporations. This is decided\npragmatically. The railways are mostly corporations, which raise private finance. The airport has\nalso been corporatized. Power, telecoms, and ports have all been longestablished private sector\nactivities and recently BOT projects have been developed for refuse transfer stations, landfill sites,\nand chemical waste treatment.", "Appendix 1, page 35\nIn the roads sector the government has followed two different approaches to PSP:\n\u2022 Management contracts.\n- For tunnels (e.g., Lion Rock, Aberdeen). Tenders have been on the basis of what\nbidders are willing to accept ($/vehicle) over a four or five year franchise period to\noperate the toll facilities on behalf of Government, maintain the facility and control\ntraffic. Equipment has been provided by the Government. The resulting bids have all\ncome in below Government\u2019s estimates.\n- For the Tsing Ma Control Area (the Airport Corridor), where a fixed price lump-sum\ncontract has been let in view of uncertainty over traffic. This is an innovative traffic\ncontrol project, developed for a single corridor.\n- The Cross Harbour Tunnel franchise expires in late 1999, when the tunnel reverts to\nGovernment. It then intends to let a manage, operate, and maintain concession for\n2 years, with the possibility of extension, and toll levels unchanged.\n\u2022 BOT contracts. Hong Kong, China has a Legislative Council (Legco) comprising of\nelected representatives who are key to project implementation while the Executive\nCouncil (Exco) and civil servants undertake project development. This creates problems\nfor civil servants, with the need for much lobbying to get decisions through Legco.\na. Tariff Policy\nThe Government has had no tariff policy. Bidders would propose the toll levels, and the\nGovernment would confirm an acceptable level during bid evaluation and negotiation. However, a\nnew system has now been introduced, following the Western Harbour Tunnel negotiations. This\nsystem guarantees that tariffs will be increased, and is an important support for private sector\ninterest in the process.\nUnder the old system, it has been difficult for concessionaires to obtain approval for a toll\nincrease. The original Cross Harbour Tunnel had a $5 toll (cars), then in 1984 a further $5 \u2018passage\ntax\u2019 was imposed. Since 1984, the toll has not been increased despite lobbying from the concession\ncompany. This is because the tunnel is very profitable and \u2018it provides the people with choice\u2019 (and\nhas become an almost un-tolled alternative).\nThe result is that both the Eastern and Western harbour tunnels have been adversely affected,\nthe latter in particular carrying traffic which is only a small proportion of its capacity. The Eastern\nHarbour Tunnel took the matter of its toll increases to arbitration, as allowed under the concession\nagreement. It won the case, but the uncertainty associated with this provided a major disincentive\nto potential concessionaires.\nThe toll differential for cars is HK$30-10-15, for the WHT-CHT-EHT. It is therefore not\nsurprising that the Cross Harbour Tunnel (dual 2-lane) attracts the vast majority of traffic, with\nabout 120,000 vehicle per day (vpd), compared with 35,000 in the Western Harbour Tunnel (dual 3-\nlane) and 80,000 vpd in the Eastern Harbour Tunnel (dual 3-lane). The Western Harbour Tunnel\ntraffic has been increased somewhat by petrol coupons and toll discounts.", "Appendix 1, page 36\nThe new system now provided includes:\n\u2022 A schedule of defined tolls, and years when increases will take place, and the size of\nthose increases.\n\u2022 A range (low-high) of allowable financial internal rates of return for the project (e.g., 15-\n18 percent).\n\u2022 A range of net revenue projections over the concession period (revenues minus\noperations costs minus interest payments).\n\u2022 A seat on the concession company Board for Government.\nEach year, the company is required to submit audited accounts and the resulting \u2018net revenue\u2019\nto the Government, to compare with the projections. When the franchisee\u2019s revenue is more than\nthe amount projected, the excess is placed in a Toll Stability Fund. Government has the right to use\nthis money to defer a toll increase which would otherwise fall due. When the franchisee\u2019s revenue\nis less than projected, the Government may use the fund to top up the franchisee\u2019s revenue to the\nminimum agreed level. If the balance of the fund is insufficient to do this, the franchisee may bring\nforward a toll increase, subject to vetting of accounts by the Government. If moneys remain at the\nend of the concession period, they revert to the government exchequer.\nThe result of this approach is to:\n\u2022 Reduce downside risk to the concessionaire who may receive revenue support and/or\nis allowed to bring forward toll increases, if the fund is cash-rich.\n\u2022 Provide upside cash for government.\nThe key issue reinforced by the existing economic turndown is still, however, the traffic in\nthe early years. If that is low, then there is no fund to support revenues, and the limit of the support\nto the concessionaire is to allow flexibility in tariff changes.\nThere remains concern that the existing process is leading to costly infrastructure being\nunder-utilized.\nb. The Bidding Process\nThe Hong Kong, China bidding process is transparent and follows on from the Government\nfeasibility study and preliminary design. A detailed project brief and conforming design is produced.\nThe upcoming bidding is advertised and advised through consulates widely. The Government lays\ndown three imperatives:\n\u2022 Investors must build the facility to a fixed cost and within a fixed time.\n\u2022 The shareholders must guarantee revenue in the first 5 years.\n\u2022 Investors must fund their equity - and be joint-and-severally liable.", "Appendix 1, page 37\nThe process then proceeds as follows:\n\u2022 Interested parties collect the bidding documents for HK$1 million. There is no short-\nlisting procedure. Tenderers are typically given 4 months to submit their bids. These\nmust include the conforming design, but may include alternatives.\n\u2022 Three government committees (finance/administrative, traffic/transport, and land/\nengineering) evaluate the bids, independently of each other, over a 4-week period. An\nindependent member of the anti-corruption force is in attendance at such meetings.\n\u2022 Bidders are given two opportunities to refine their bid, after clarification is sought by the\nGovernment where necessary.\n\u2022 The bidders are progressively narrowed down, the intention being to competitively\nnegotiate almost to a conclusion. The authority of Exco is sought before negotiations\nwith 1 or 2 bidders commences, and again to confirm the terms of the finally\nnegotiated bid.\n\u2022 The bidders are required to submit a fixed cost and fixed implementation time to\noperation. This requires bidders to obtain fixed prices from their contractors, with back-\nto-back agreements. The result is to substantially remove cost and time risk for the\nconcessionaire, and all projects have opened early, with contractor and concessionaire\nsharing the excess income generated. Contractors have learned to accept this approach\nproviding there are no subsequent changes.\n\u2022 The key evaluation criterion is lowest tariff.\nThe Government has had access to a pool of international experts in the technical,\nfinancing and legal disciplines, who have assisted the effective implementation of the BOT process\nmaterially.\nHong Kong, China appears to be different from other countries in the region in that its\nconcessionaires are often not the major contractors. Originally the contractors led. The Government\nprefers concessionaires not to have contractor equity.\nWhat has changed the picture is not government guidance on the composition of bidding\nconsortia, but:\n\u2022 Contractors do not now have the funds for equity investment. This was the case -\nNishimatsu for example were prepared to take up virtually all the equity for Tate\u2019s Cairn,\nwhereas now they may be prepared to take 15 percent. The Japanese contractors are\nhurting badly due to the recession and to domestic problems.\n\u2022 Conversely, property developers do have cash to invest and some projects are linked to\nproperty development. The Route 3 project goes through massive land holdings of Sun\nHung Kai, the lead investor.\n\u2022 Maybe increased competition with the need to submit a keenly priced bid.", "Appendix 1, page 38\nThe situation is as follows:\n.\n           Project Concessionare (and original        Contractors\n             shareholding)19\nEastern Harbour Tunnel 100% - Kumagai Gumi (now CITIC Kumagai Gumi\nhave a stake)\nTate\u2019s Cairn Tunnel 37% - Nishimatsu\n25% - New World\n20% - China Resources\n18% - C Itoh, Jardine, Trafalgar\nHouse\nWestern Harbour crossing 35% - CITIC Gammon, Kumagai Gumi,\n35% - Cross Harbour Tunnel Nishimatsu\nCountry Park (Route 3) 50% - Sun Hung Kai Nishimatsu, Gammon\n50% - 3 Chinese group (China Dragages\nResources, China Travel, Bank of\nChina)\nThe evidence from Hong Kong, China\u2019s experience is that:\n\u2022 The bids have attracted very strong concessionaires and contractors - giving Government\nconfidence that they will deliver on the very demanding projects offered.\n\u2022 There was only one bidder for WHC. A further bidder comprising the Cross Harbour\nTunnel Company and CITIC pulled out when they received high fixed cost bids from\ntheir contractors. In this case the bidding nearly failed.\n\u2022 Negotiations have resulted in major reductions in bid prices.\n\u2022 Contractors \u2018volunteered\u2019 to take on risks to sweeten their bid. Thus, Nishimatsu were\nprepared to take on the risk that the Government may not have resumed all the land\n(i.e., the resulting risk of delay).\nThe change in tariff adjustment introduced during the WHC negotiations, was too late to\nstop the only 2 bidders combining, which undermined Government\u2019s negotiating position.\nGovernment provides all land unencumbered at no cost, and also often a substantial\ninvestment in access roads. All other costs must be paid from toll and ancillary revenues.\nHow profitable are Hong Kong, China\u2019s BOT roads? In Hong Kong, China, there has been\nup-front Government support, land has been provided free and approach roads beyond the immediate\nvicinity of the tunnels, have been funded by government. Given this, the financial viability of the\nconcessions is summarized as follows:\n19 The Cross Harbour Tunnel Company wanted to be involved in WHC, because their concession runs out in 1999.\nCITIC wanted to be involved in WHC because they were involved in Eastern Harbour Crossing - and with the Cross Harbour\nTunnel tolls low, WHC and Eastern Harbour Crossing competed.", "Appendix 1, page 39\n\u2022 Cross Harbour Tunnel is hugely profitable. The 30-year franchise concludes in 1999,\nand Government is considering what to do then.\n\u2022 Eastern Harbour Crossing is probably OK. Traffic was lower than forecast for the first\n2/3 years because the linking infrastructure was not open, but is now close to\nprojections.\n\u2022 Tate\u2019s Cairn Tunnel is in trouble. No dividends have yet been paid to shareholders (it\nopened in 1991). It suffers from \u2018competition\u2019 from Lion Rock Tunnel, which is\ngovernment-tolled. The banks will suffer if there is no success in increasing revenues.\nThe concession company has gone to great lengths to attract traffic - e.g., offering\npetrol tickets (giving discounts at Mobil stations). They have tried reducing tolls - but\nlost revenue. Originally they attracted almost 100 percent of trucks but the Lion Rock\ntunnel charges $6 flat (irrespective of truck type), and Tate\u2019s Cairns now carries very\nfew trucks.\n\u2022 WHC is in trouble, with revenue much lower than forecast. Its success depends\non the Airport/Route 3 corridor, and the Government policy on tolling the Cross-\nHarbour Tunnel. The financing is all non recourse and the banks will suffer if it is\nnot profitable.\n\u2022 Route 3 opened late in 1998 and early reports are that traffic is much lower than forecast.\nIts HK$15 toll has failed to attract motorists despite the considerable saving in time that\nthe tunnel offers over the alternative free, but much longer routes. Traffic was recently\nreported as 33,000vpd, compared with a tunnel capacity of 135,000vpd.\nThus of the five projects, there is one definitely profitable, one or two probably profitable and\ntwo or three in trouble.\n3. Project Identification\nThe Hong Kong process is dramatically different from the rest of Asia, with a thorough\nand effective process being led by the Government. There are a series of Comprehensive\nTransportation Studies (CTS), updated every five years. These determine future strategy. They\nare supplemented where necessary by sectoral studies, for example, the second Rail\nDevelopment Strategy has recently been completed. Government is actively involved in these\nstudies, making sure it \u2018owns\u2019 their results. One result of this process is that the uncertainties of\nfuture development strategy and transport strategy are much less than is the case in most Asian\ncountries.\nProjects can also be identified by the private sector. In this case the project is subject to the\nsame subsequent investigations as would be expected in a publicly-identified project and to\ncompetitive bidding. The only advantage for the unsolicited bidder is the lead-time he has in studying\nthe project.\nThere are currently two competing tolling technologies, providing non-stop passage at\ntoll plazas for vehicles with tags. The tag companies require drivers to have a bank account\nin credit, and they are billed periodically. It is clearly inconvenient when drivers pass through\ndifferent tunnels remembering which requires which tag, and the 2 companies have now\nmerged, resulting in one technology applied across all tunnels where auto-tolling has been\nintroduced.", "Appendix 1, page 40\nIt is likely that there will always be a dual system (electronic tags and manual) because:\n\u2022 Government does not wish to force drivers to open a monthly account.\n\u2022 The tollgates are a means of merging many to 2 or 3 lanes, and controlling the traffic\nflow.\n\u2022 The tags provided are a way of \u2018jumping the queue\u2019.\n4.

Conclusions and Comments\nIn terms of process Hong Kong, China\u2019s system is without doubt Asia\u2019s leader, through\nits combination of:\n\u2022 A territory which is amenable to BOT - because of hills and the harbor which need\ncrossing. The BOT projects comprise three harbor crossings, one land tunnel, and one\nland tunnel combined with Route 3.\n\u2022 A Government which has an effective integrated land use/transport planning system.\nThis reduces uncertainty as to future development, and the future transport network, as\nwell as allowing the suitable BOT projects to be identified.\n\u2022 A Government which over 25 years has learned pragmatically as projects have been\ndeveloped (they have opened in 1972, 1989, 1991, 1997, 1998).\nThe process has been improved to seek the right balance between:\n\u2022 Government\u2019s interests in not providing guarantee or investment.\n\u2022 User interests in low tariffs.\n\u2022 Concessionaire\u2019s interests in a reliable financial return.\n\u2022 Lenders interests by putting a floor under the downside risk.\n\u2022 A dynamic market of investors, contractors, bankers, and consultants.\nMuch of this has been accomplished when political uncertainty surrounding the lead up to\nthe 1997 handover has made financing problematic.\nOver the period, five major BOT projects have been completed, one every 5 years on\naverage. Each has involved massive effort by Government throughout the planning, implementation,\nand operational phases. It may be conjectured that in terms of person-months effort the Hong\nKong, China Government and its advisers spend many, many times the effort of most other Asian\ngovernments in planning and procuring BOT projects. The results are projects which promote\npublic policy, secure innovation, and the benefits of competition.\nAlongside BOT projects, Government has let management contracts for Government tunnels,\nand latterly for the innovative Tsing Ma Control Area.\nHong Kong, China has, in the past, transferred the vast majority of risks to the\nconcessionaire, and provided no guarantees. This was very successful with the first project, the\nCross Harbour Tunnel. Subsequent tunnels have not been so successful, requiring higher tolls\nto make them viable, and problems from the competition created by the cheaper tolls of the\ncentrally-located Cross Harbour Tunnel. In the future, government recognizes it will have to\nassume a greater proportion of risk if private sector financing of road infrastructure is to be\nforthcoming.", "Appendix 1, page 45\nLooking ahead, a massive new roads program is envisaged, more than HK$200 billion\nover 8-10 years, with most projects starting construction by 2002. Perhaps surprisingly, however,\nthere may not be much more private funding of Hong Kong, China\u2019s transport infrastructure. The\nmain reasons are:\n\u2022 A lack of suitable projects - most major corridors will have a tolled bridge/tunnel operated\nby Government or the private sector. So far, Government has not considered reverse\ntender BOT projects, in which it would invest.\n\u2022 The size and riskiness of some projects, which are not amenable to private sector\nfunding.\n\u2022 The availability of parallel \u2018free\u2019 routes.\nThere may be opportunity for far more corridor management by the private sector, but as\nyet there is no view that this should happen.\nIt may be conjectured that with speculation about the RMB and HK$, Government will not\nbe able to avoid shouldering the foreign exchange risk in the future.\nThe big problems to date have been:\n\u2022 Tariffs and tariff increases. The new approach described above does much to reduce\nthis.\n\u2022 Parallel Government tolled facilities. This has caused severe problems for some\nconcessionaires. In the future, Government policy may have to change, with bids for\nfuture concessions sought on the basis of specific tolls levels and their future increases.", "Appendix 2, page 1\nOTHER EXPERIENCE\nA. People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)\n1. Context\nHistorically, there has been little travel between cities, and PRC depends upon the rail\nsystem (and lately air transport as well) for the main inter-urban movements. The road system is\npoorly developed. Most roads are single 2-lane carriageways, although some dual-carriageways\nexist. Provinces often impose tolls on road users at irregularly spaced toll plazas. Typically, the\ntraffic using the existing road system includes animals and bicycle traffic, farm vehicles such as\nsmall tractors (rotovators on wheels with trailers), a high proportion of goods vehicle, and few cars.\nAverage speeds are low, accidents frequent, and congestion can be severe as the high proportion\nof slow vehicles reduces road capacity.\nTraditionally, road construction has been the responsibility of the public sector, with\nconstruction undertaken by government and the provinces. Some provinces have set up specific\ndepartments to manage expressway construction, although these are always subservient to the\nprovince for revenues.\n2. Government Policy\nGovernment used to be strongly against tolls, but it is now supportive and developing policies\nfor tariff setting, provision of tax exemption during the debt service period etc. Almost all expressways\nin PRC now collect tolls. Operations are complex, involving government and provincial corporations.\nThe tolls vary by location and project.\nGovernment has determined to construct a large National Trunk Road System, linking all\ncities greater than 0.5 million people (Figure A2.1). This will comprise 12 trunk highways comprising\n35,000 kilometers of expressways (like the US interstate freeways). Many World Bank (e.g., Beijing-\nTianjin, Xiamen-Guangzhou) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) projects comprise sections\nof this network, implemented under loans to Government or provinces.\nFunding for roads comes from a combination of:\n\u2022 The State (a Ministry of Communications support which used to be around 3 million\nRmb/km for any expressway on the planned network - and is now a loan).\n\u2022 The Provincial budget - taxes and user charges which include tolls on existing roads.\nIncreasingly, expressway financing has moved from central to the provincial authorities,\nwho access private funds and foreign capital markets.\nCities are treated differently and are under different jurisdiction. Expressways are more\ndifficult to develop in urban areas for the usual right-of-way reasons, but both Shanghai and\nGuangzhou have a ring road system, and Beijing has a tolled expressway to its airport.\nGovernment has recently announced a massive investment program in infrastructure, and\nis about to finalize a framework (for build-operate-transfer (BOT), corporatization, concessioning,\nleasing) and Implementing Rules and Regulations which are intended to \u2018open China\u2019 to foreign\ninvestors. The currently unclear and complex approach to private sector funding may then become\nclearer.", "Table A2.1:  China National Trunk Road System\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n 2\n,\n p\na\ng\ne\n 2", "Appendix 2, page 3\n3. PRC is Different\nPRC is different - because toll roads are often \u2018profitable\u2019 - that is the toll revenues are\nadequate to fund their capital, operations and maintenance costs and provide an acceptable return\nto shareholders. This is because:\n\u2022 Capital costs are low, inputs are often not costed at market prices, and technical\nstandards are \u2018appropriate\u2019. Typically, toll roads in PRC are built with large contingents\nof local labor mobilized by the local Governments, together with local materials. The\nsole non-local component is the thin blacktop at the end, and the sole high-tech.\nmachinery is that required to apply it. The result is a very low capital cost.\n\u2022 Revenues are high. This is a combination of:\n- High traffic diversion to the toll-road at opening: the alternative is either nonexistent\nor heavily congested, so that the time savings are large.\n- Relatively high tolls, which are acceptable (there is little history of resistance to\ngovernment-imposed tariffs).\n- Tolls are often a small proportion of the perceived total journey cost (which includes\nprovincial taxes, routine bribes to the police, and fuel). Hence, they are regarded by\nmany companies/drivers as \u2018good value for money\u2019 given the large time saving over\nthe alternative congested road, with more efficient use of the vehicle resulting.\n- High traffic growth, a result of rapid economic growth, and a lack of alternative routes.\n4. Private Sector Participation (PSP) Practices for Toll Roads\nMost of the concessionaires for privately-financed toll roads have been based upon joint\nventures with public entities. These may be foreign-owned, equity joint ventures or cooperative joint\nventures. The latter is most common, allowing flexibility in the allocation of rights and obligations\nbetween the local and foreign partners.\nTraditional forms of project financing are rare in this sector, and most foreign financing is\nsourced from equity investments and shareholder loans to cooperative joint ventures in PRC from\nthe parent company abroad. These funds are typically raised through a public offering of shares, or\nthrough commercial loans; for example, nine PRC highway stocks had been listed on the Hong\nKong Stock Exchange by 1997. In a few cases conventional project financing has been achieved,\nwith the public sector entity guaranteeing the revenues of the project company.\nIt is estimated that 2,800kms of expressways have passed into private hands in the last 5-\n6  years,  raising  some  US$5  billion-US$6  billion  of  private  capital.  There  are  about\n800 concession agreements, all of which are either leasing or Buy-Operate-Transfer. Typically,\nan upfront payment is made by a developer, the proceeds of which are used to further develop\nthe network. There are no conventional BOTs.", "Appendix 2, page 4\n5. Key Issues\nMuch has been learned in this sector, and both ADB and the World Bank have been\nactive in assisting government develop its policy framework for PSP. The main issues which\nhave arisen include:\n\u2022 Concerns with asset securitization. This is in widespread use, an existing asset (e.g.,\nan expressway built under multilateral funding assistance) has been used to raise finance\nfrom foreign investors. Typically, construction/completion risks are carried by the\nGovernment entity, and the Government accesses additional financing readily, while\nthe prospect of returns from tolls are high for the private sector. The concern is twofold:\nthat the assets may be over-leveraged (compromising the ability to repay the original\nloan), and that use of the capital markets may not be a secure source of funding, in the\nevent of the boom-bust characteristics of many stock markets. This is a particular\nconcern in the light of the recent crisis.\n\u2022 Need for reform to the legal and regulatory environment. There are many problems at\npresent, including the fact that the currency is not convertible (and access to foreign\nexchange when it is required), limitations on provisions of guarantees by Government,\nno automatic increases in tolls, institutional complexities when central Government is\ninvolved etc.\n\u2022 Land acquisition has led to frequent delays, and the private sector has been expected\nto shoulder unreasonable risks. Capacity building in Government and adequate\ncompensation are required to remedy this.\n\u2022 The credit-worthiness and commitment of public entities has sometimes frustrated\nand delayed development in the sector, and substantially increased costs due to the\nresulting risks.\n\u2022 Toll levels - there has been early resistance to the level of tolls on expressways, which\ncan be relatively high (over seven US cents/km for large cars on some roads). Traffic\nflows are certainly low on a number of expressways near major cities (e.g., around\n10,000vpd on the Beijing-Tianjin expressway, and even less on both Shanghai -Jiading\nand Shanghai-Xinshang-Sungzeng). However, a more commercial approach to the\nproblem is now evident. Thus, truck drivers are now often reimbursed by their firms for\ntoll receipt tickets collected when they use the expressway (ensuring they use the\nexpressway), and different rates may be applied to \u2018foreign\u2019 and local vehicles (see\nbelow). When tolls are not excessive, there is now little resistance to them. Most of the\ntraffic on the inter-urban network comprises goods vehicles and buses - cars are still\nthe exception and are usually owned by Government entities.\n\u2022 Need for transparent procurement processes \u2013 private negotiation rather than\ncompetitive bidding is the common practice. The negotiations have sometimes lasted\nmany years and after the event, have been found unsatisfactory (understandings have\nnot been delivered).\nThe role of ADB and the World Bank has been important in increasing the effectiveness of\nthe PSP approach in this sector. An ADB-funded study of the road sector in PRC, completed in\n1998, concluded that construction risk is best left to the public sector, but that when expressway", "Appendix 2, page 5\ntraffic grows to a sufficient level, leasing or securitization should be considered to mobilize private\ncapital for the sector.\nOften ad hoc deals take place, based upon relationships between Hong Kong, China or\nTaipei,China investors and a city - maybe from which they originate. Alternatively, government\ndevelopment companies may be given the task of implementing a required project, and they may\nhave stakes in foreign contractors. These deals involve no competition, and may have a wide\nrange of incentives and obligations.\n6. Kumagal Gumi (Hong Kong, China) and Everbright1\nKumagai (Hong Kong, China) recently became partly owned by China Everbright - a PRC\nGovernment development company. They expect thereby to become substantially involved in\ninfrastructure development in PRC. The mechanism may typically be:\n\u2022 The mayor or governor of a municipality/province identifies the need for a project (e.g.,\na bridge or expressway), and sells the concept to Beijing.\n\u2022 Beijing decides that it warrants investigation and requests one of its development arms\n(such as Everbright) to look at its feasibility.\n\u2022 Subject to a satisfactory outcome it is then requested to negotiate a deal with the\nappropriate authority, and then implement the agreement.\n\u2022 Kumagai (Hong Kong, China) are then given a contract by Everbright on agreed terms\nto manage implementation, employing sub-contractors as necessary.\nThis approach offers attractive prospects to foreign firms, minimizing their risk, while\nproviding their expertise in developing PRC\u2019s infrastructure.\nThere are, however, many other problems, and these are acting as a constraint on the\nfuture development of the road system, with some developers generally cautious about making\nthis type of investment in PRC. The case study of Hopewell Holdings illustrates the issues:\n7. Hopewell Holdings2\nHopewell\u2019s much-publicized involvement has been in the Hong Kong-Guangzhou-Zhuhai\n\u2018golden triangle\u2019, conceived as part of a strategic vision (Figure A2.2). This is notably different to the\nad-hoc projects seen elsewhere in Asia, and is innovative in concept, the individual projects linking\nto, and reinforcing each other.

Indian Sub-Continent\nIn recent years India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have endeavored to progress\nparticipation of the private sector in the provision of roads. There have been flurries of international\ninterest in all four countries, but progress has been at best very slow. Of all sectors of infrastructure,\nthe roads sector is recognized as the most risky, even in countries where there is a demonstrable\nability to pay for road use. The risk is substantially higher in countries where no track record - either\nof successful PSP or public acceptance of toll roads - exists.\nIt is concern over the limited economic capacity of users in the Indian Sub-Continent to pay\nfor road space, which has dissuaded potential investors. This could be partially offset by government\nguarantees or at least an understanding of, and realistic sharing, of project risks. But in countries\nwith a recent history of, and ongoing evidence of, civil unrest, strong labor union influence, and\npolitical instability, government commitments may not count for much. India has made the most\nsustained effort to attract private investment in its roads.\n1. India\nThere are about 39,000 km of National Highway, less than 5 percent of which is 4-lane,\nabout 80 percent 2-lane, and the rest is single lane. Since 1991, the Government of India has\nadopted a more liberal attitude towards private sector involvement in the management and\ndevelopment of the country\u2019s road system. In 1994 the Ministry of Surface Transportation actively\npromoted the development by the private sector of a \u201csuper national highway\u201d ultimately to be\n10,000kms of dual-carriageway segregated route along the main national corridors. The plan was\nto let PSP concessions first for a few well-trafficked routes to be followed by further concessions\nwith roads opening throughout a 30-year development period.\nState governments also actively promoted private sector involvement, since they saw PSP\nas a means of achieving their own shopping list of roads projects, invariably with no real appreciation\nof the requirements of a bankable project.\nThe Government took important steps to attract the private sector, including necessary\nlegislative changes to expedite toll road concessions, but despite this it became apparent that\nmajor expressway projects could not attract international interest without substantial Government\nguarantees. Not surprisingly, international interest soon waned, but domestic investors remained\npositive, and positioned themselves for the time when Government expectations might be more\nachievable.\nThe plans for a whole new expressway network have now been shelved and the Ministry of\nSurface Transportation plans to four-lane about 14,000km of the existing network over the next 10\nyears. The priority corridors linking Delhi, Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta total 6,000km, and\n5,000kms of this has still to be widened. Technical project preparation is in hand for most of this\nlength.\nAbout eleven BOT concessions have been let, all small projects - bridges and bypasses, to\nmajor Indian players. These projects require relatively low long-term capital investment, and have a\nmore easily-captured revenue.\nTolls are being charged on a section of the Delhi/Bombay road. A franchise for toll\ncollection was let, but the concessionaire is facing problems because of low traffic. In India, it", "Appendix 2, page 10\nhas proved important to keep the truck drivers (highly unionised) happy, and relations between\nstate and the central government are sometimes problematic, frustrating project development.\nIt is envisaged that much of the planned network upgrading will be funded through the\nWorld Bank, but the Ministry of Surface Transportation is trying to define criteria for the selection of\nlengths which could be viable for private sector funding. Government has put one rupee per liter\n\u201croad tax\u201d on the price of petrol (not diesel yet), and this could provide public funding support for\nPSP deals.\n2. Pakistan\nPrior to 1995, the Government of Pakistan, through the National Highway Authority, had\noffered a variety of projects to the private sector for development on a BOT basis. Generally, the\nprojects were not well prepared and were not supported by independent feasibility analysis. This\nresulted in international bidders having serious doubts about the credibility of the National Highway\nAuthority and its ability to understand and therefore to deliver any commitments made. Recognizing\nthis, ADB funded a technical assistance project to prepare a comprehensive plan for PSP in the\nroad sector, covering policy formulation, institutional development, the preparation of model\nprocedures and documents, and the identification of projects worthy of detailed feasibility study. A\nprivate sector cell within the National Highway Authority was set up, among other things to administer\na proposed Private Sector Highway Development Fund.\nThe Government has initiated a major (US$5 billion) motorway program, but lack of\nprofessional resources to administer the program is likely to undermine credibility. A number of\nprojects have been promoted, but none yet implemented as BOT.\nThe operation and maintenance contract for the recently opened Lahore-Islamabad Motorway\n\u2014 constructed using contractors credit \u2014 is reportedly being awarded to a private consortium with\ninternational members, which is also seeking to complete and operate the Lahore Bypass and\nLahore Ring road within the same contract.\n3. Bangladesh\nThe Government of Bangladesh has signaled its intention to bring about economic reform\nand take measures to attract private sector investment in infrastructure. Emphasis has been put\non the power sector and in 1996, the Government established a Power Cell, charged with\ncoordinating the country\u2019s private power program, which it is doing with notable success.\nIn the road sector, the only initiative taken by the Government (and World Bank) to date has\nbeen the evaluation of the Dhaka Eastern Bypass as a BOT project. As part of the consultancy\nstudy, model procedures and documentation were prepared which could form the basis for road\nsector PSP policy and plans. Realistically, however, this should be viewed as the first step towards\ndeveloping an appreciation by the public and private sectors of the realities, opportunities and\nlimitations of PSP in the country\u2019s roads sector.\nTo build upon this start and spread the program to other sectors of infrastructure, the\nGovernment, with international support, has established a Private Sector Infrastructure Development\nFund and an organization to administer it. But realistically, the road sector will need to fall in line\nbehind power and telecommunications which will be perceived by private investors as providing\nbetter, less risky opportunities.", "Appendix 2, page 11\n4. Sri Lanka\nThe country\u2019s Road Development Authority does not have the resources \u2014 financial or\nprofessional \u2014 to progress major road schemes. The Airport Expressway (ColomboKatunayake)\nhas been a Road Development Authority priority since the early \u201880s, with no progress made as\nyet. The Road Development Authority has offered the project for PSP and international companies\nhave made exploratory investigations. If any corridor can offer a viable PSP scheme, then it must\nbe this one. The fact that international interest has not resulted in any positive moves suggests\nthat it could be some time, dependent upon improvement in the internal situation, before private\ninvestment in Sri Lanka\u2019s road sector will become a reality. Having said this, the Government is\nagain actively seeking to promote this project as a BOT project, but now with some government\nsupport.\n5. The Problems\nThe private sector perceive the following problems which need to be overcome before\nsignificant private sector investment will occur in the road sector in the Indian Sub-Continent:\n\u2022     Lack of institutional capacity and experience in project finance.\n\u2022 Limited consumer affordability and low traffic densities.\n\u2022 Unclear tariff policies and absence of regulatory framework.\n\u2022 Lack of transparency and competition in procurement.\n\u2022 Political instability, civil unrest, labor union power.", "Appendix 2, page 12\nC. Indonesia\n1. Development of Toll Roads\nBetween 1978 and 1990, Government financed all toll roads. The state toll road agency\nJasa Marga initially operated them, but later took responsibility for financing and construction.\nThe 46 km Jagorawi toll road south of Jakarta was the first such toll road, and Jasa Marga was\nresponsible for toll collection and maintenance. The finance for toll roads was sourced through\nforeign loans repaid by the Ministry of Finance, and low-interest bonds sold to employee pension\nfunds.\nAfter 1990, the Government granted a license to Jasa Marga to develop, construct, and\noperate toll roads in cooperation with the private sector. Presidential Decree 25/1 987 required that\nJasa Marga be involved in all toll road construction. Private entities were required to set up joint\nventures with Jasa Marga, who were therefore both investor and regulator.\nThere are two forms of private sector arrangement:\n\u2022 Build-Transfer-Operate. A cooperation agreement is signed with Jasa Marga, and the\nroad is handed over to Jasa Marga once constructed. The private investor receives a\nshare of the toll revenues over the concession period.\n\u2022 Modified turnkey. Investors fund, design, and construct the toll road. Jasa Marga then\noperates the road and the investor receives an agreed share of revenues, with no\ninvolvement in the operations.\nSince 1994, foreign investors can work with Indonesian companies in promoting projects.\nThey are required to cooperate with Jasa Marga through a domestic joint venture.\nIndonesia\u2019s Sixth National Development Plan provided for the construction of 688 kms of\ntoll roads by 1999, and 1935 kms by 2020. By mid-1997, 15 projects and 472 kms had been\nconstructed, of which 150 kms had been constructed and were being operated by private sector\nconcessionaires.\n2. Key Issues\nThere have been many problems to date, as follows:\n\u2022 Uncertainty about tariff adjustments. This has required the approval of the President to\nevery such change, undermining confidence in the revenue stream.\n\u2022 Transparency in procurement. Concessions have usually been granted to well-\nconnected parties, and not as the result of competitive bidding. This has distorted the\nobjectives of PSP.\n\u2022 Land acquisition. This has been problematic and a major problem. Responsibility for\nthe cost is with Government, yet they have sometimes tried to transfer this to the\nprivate sector.\n\u2022 The road planning framework has sometimes been weak, and there has not been\nconfidence that the projects identified for implementation are the key priorities.", "Appendix 2, page 13\n\u2022 The domestic capital markets for private capital have been small, leaving the government\nbanks and pension funds as the only sources of domestic capital.\n\u2022 Privatization of Jasa Marga. Prior to the crisis, it was the government\u2019s intention to raise\nsubstantial funds from this. It is now recognized this will not be possible and the role\nand capitalization of Jasa Marga are under consideration.\n3. The Economic Crisis and Government Response\nThe economic crisis hit Indonesia hard, resulting in a major currency realignment, increased\ndomestic interest rates, increased petrol prices, lower traffic Ievels, and lower expectations of\nfuture traffic. This has created major problems for existing projects, and the collapse of the domestic\nbanking sector has stopped all ongoing toll road projects.\nThe Government has taken steps to restructure the toll road program in the light of these\nevents. All projects have been reviewed, and been prioritized.\nThese changes, together with political changes, have led government to reappraise and\nrealign its policy for PSP in the light of the new imperatives. Presidential Decree 7/1998 provided a\nmajor change to the procurement of toll roads. This:\n\u2022 Mandated the issue of open competitive bidding for all infrastructure projects.\n\u2022 Required such projects to come from a \u2018List of Infrastructure Development projects\u2019\nthat had been subject to initial screening on their bankability and planning aspects.\n\u2022 Mandated that all unsolicited bids would be subject to competitive bidding. Work to\nimplement these provisions has proceeded.\nAs noted above, all toll roads have been reviewed and prioritized, and the future of Jasa\nMarga is under consideration.", "Appendix 2, page 14\nD. Latin America\nLatin America has many examples of PSP in the roads sector, and three countries have\nbeen selected as of direct relevance to this technical assistance:\n\u2022 Argentina, which has innovated extensively\n\u2022 Mexico, which has implemented a vast BOT program of expressways - with many\nlessons.\n\u2022 Colombia, where the government has a system of public tolled roads as well as a road\nconcessioning program. The concessioning program has had regional economic\ndevelopment as one of its objectives.\n1. Argentina\nThere are three different approaches to private sector investment in roads in Argentina:\n\u2022 Concessions - for rehabilitation, operation and maintenance of 9,000 kms of the main\nroad network with traffic volumes of at least 2,500vpd.\n\u2022 Construct, operate, and maintain for a relatively small network of non-tolled national\nroads, in good condition. This approach is still under development.\n\u2022 Contrato de Recuperaci\u00f3n y Mantenimiento (CREMA) for rehabilitation and maintenance\nof 14,400 kms of the national road network. Most of the roads in this program required\nsome initial rehabilitation work.\nThe Government introduced these private sector initiatives because of a crisis in road\nmanagement by the end of the 1 980s when under-funding over many years had left Argentina with\nthe worst maintained network among all upper middle income countries. Thirty percent of the\npaved roads were in poor condition in 1989.\nIn 1989, the Highway Reconversion decree anticipated private sector involvement in highway\nmatters and this was followed by the State Reform Law which provided for Direci\u00f3n Nacional de\nVialidad (DNV) to repair and maintain the national arterial road network through partial or total\nconcessions. Since then, the mechanisms by which the private sector is involved, have evolved.\na. Concessions\nThe first mechanism for private sector involvement was to concession approximately 9,000\nkm of the main road network. The call for bids, in 1989, specified that:\n\u2022 Concessions would run for 12 years.\n\u2022 There was a fixed toll structure. There was a uniform rate per kilometer for each class\nof vehicle and tolls were then applied on the basis of size of vehicle, number of axles\nand distance from last toll plaza. There was also some inflation protection for\nconcessionaires, through a formula involving Consumer Price Index (CPI), Wholesale\nPrice Index and the US dollar value.", "Appendix 2, page 15\n\u2022 A list of initial rehabilitation works, which had to be completed before tolls could be\ncollected, was specified.\n\u2022 A list of priority works, which had to be completed before 3 years of the concession had\nelapsed, was specified.\n\u2022 A list of improvement works, which were necessary to keep the road at the quality\nrequired for the 12 years of the concession, was specified.\n\u2022 No Government guarantees for the project were given.\n\u2022 The concessionaire was required to form a corporation or joint venture for the sole\npurpose of administering the concession.\n\u2022 Income above expected levels would be used to improve the level of service provided\non the roads.\n\u2022 The concessionaire must control excess loads at weighing stations and were authorized\nto collect compensation from such loads.\n\u2022 The concessionaire was required to take legal responsibility for any accidents occurring\nbecause of a poorly maintained road.\nHowever, it did not specify how the corridors must be packaged, leaving bidders free to bid\nfor groups of corridors.\nAll 147 bids were assessed in terms of the appropriateness of their traffic studies and on\nthe economic and financial plans which they involved. A weighted formula was used to consider\nthe following elements for all bids:\n\u2022 Total expenditure on:\n- initial works\n- priority works\n- investment in improvement works\n- investment in any additional works\n\u2022 Proposed routine maintenance work.\n\u2022 Proposed toll collection system and facilities.\n\u2022 The \u2018canon\u2019 to the state - which was the key criterion. In Latin America, the term canon\nis widely used to refer to payments from private sector to Government for the right to\nprovide, and charge for the provision of, a service.\nConcessions were awarded in 1990. The road segments all had at least 2000-2500 vpd.\nThe total canon to be collected by the Government was US$890 million (in 1990 dollars).\nA control entity was established to manage the concessions on behalf of the DNV. It\nensures that the concessionaires comply with their technical obligations and deals with relations\nwith road users. However, it relies on the concessionaires for all the traffic and toll revenue\ninformation.", "Appendix 2, page 16\nProblems with the concessions approach were, however, already evident by early 1991:\n\u2022 The convertibility law in February 1991 set the Argentinean dollar to parity with the\nAmerican  dollar  thereby  doubling  the  relative  price  of  the  toll  for  local  users\n(to around $3 per 100km). This pegging also made the tariff escalation clauses\nillegal.\n\u2022 The concessionaires were collecting tolls without having undertaken the initial works.\n\u2022 Tollbooths were located to capture traffic in suburban areas which was generating\nsignificant popular opposition to the program.\nThe DNV suspended contracts and re-negotiated the concession agreements. The\nrenegotiation led to the following changes:\n\u2022 Reduction of tolls by 50 percent.\n\u2022 Elimination of the canon payments.\n\u2022 Introduction of government subsidies of around US$57 million per annum (allocated\nbetween concessionaires on the basis of their value added tax contributions \u2013 in effect\ntherefore a shadow toll).\n\u2022 Relocation of the tollbooths.\n\u2022 Changes to the schedule of works.\n\u2022 Extension of the concessions to 13 years.\nTraffic on these inter-city concessions more than quadrupled between 1991 and 1996.\nThis took toll revenues from around US$60 million in 1991 to US$258 million in 1996. The\ngrowth, however, flattened out because of the recession from 1995 onwards. Maintenance also\nimproved greatly, so that only 25 percent of roads were in bad condition in 1993 and a predicted\n10 percent in 1997.\nThe government proved reluctant to allow toll increases and hence the support payments\nrose from US$23 million in 1991 to US$65 million in 1996 (the Government has not estimated\nwhether the private sector is maintaining roads at a lower cost than the public sector did prior to\nconcessioning.)\nSubsequently about 500km of the network has been concessioned on the access roads to\nmajor cities (starting with Buenos Aires in 1992). These concessions involve some new\nconstruction and are for longer durations - in Cordoba for example a 349 km network has been\nconcessioned for 25 years.\nThe structure of the access roads concessions is similar to that described above, in particular,\nthey require substantial investments before tolls can be levied and there are no traffic guarantees.\nHowever, the concessions were usually bid on the single criterion of the basic toll level (which is\nindexed on the US CPI). Concessionaires were also sometimes required to build parallel free\nroads, mainly to act as collector streets.\nOne example of these access roads was the Acceso Ezeiza Canuelas (the Ricchieri\nTollway). This contract consists of improvements to the existing 16 km highway (from central", "Appendix 2, page 17\ncity to airport), construction of a new 31 km road, at the end of the existing road, and maintenance\nand operation of the full length of the road. Tolls cannot be levied until the end of the construction\nperiod (two years) and will be adjusted annually on the basis of the US CPI. The peso toll level is to\nbe adjusted monthly to reflect changes in exchange rates.\nThe concession was awarded for 22 years and 8 months in 1993 and the award criterion\nwas the size of canon that the concessionaire would pay the Government. The Government and\nconcessionaire worked together to identify the alignment which represented a balance of economic\nand socio-economic objectives. The concessionaire is required, under the contract, to build another\nlane if the traffic level grows above a certain threshold.\nThough very innovative, the concession was undermined when the largest of the six\ncompanies in the consortium went into receivership in March 1996 and the project has therefore\nbeen put on hold.\nSome of the new construction for these concessions has required land acquisition and\npopulation resettlement. This has been managed by the relevant provincial government with\nassistance from municipalities as necessary. The risks associated with this were, however, assigned\nto the concessionaires and this did lead to significant delay on two of the concessions (such that by\n1997 construction was still delayed).\nIn 1995, the Government issued rules on concession re-negotiating. All negotiations in\n1991 had been on a bilateral basis, with each party looking to maximize its gains. There were no\nrules to specify what could and what could not be changed. The new rules however determine all\noptions and terms of eligibility so that each concessionaire is dealt with on the same basis. In\nDecember 1996 the regulation of concessions for road and rail was handed to a new agency\nreporting to the Secretary for Public Works and Transport.\nTypically the concession companies are joint ventures of Argentinean and International\nconstruction companies.\nThe IFC has lent to two toll road projects in Argentina:\n\u2022 REC Toll Highway - approved in 1995. The project is $161 million with an International\nFinance Corporation (IFC) loan of $20 million.\n\u2022 Western Access Road - approved in 1996. The project is $272 million with an IFC loan\nof $35 million.\nThe Inter-American Development Bank is currently preparing a loan to support the Cordoba\naccess roads project through the 2 year construction phase before tolls can be levied.\nb. COT (Construct-Operate-Maintain)\nThe construct, operate, and maintain network includes 1,879 km of national roads to be\nconcessioned under a non-tolled arrangement. The government will allocate US$36 million per\nyear for the up-keep of these roads. Arrangements for this form of concession are still being developed\nin 1998.", "Appendix 2, page 18\nc.  CREMA (Rehabilitate and Maintain)\nThe contracts under CREMA are fixed price rehabilitate and maintain contracts for five\nyears. Bidding is highly specified in terms of defining the minimum level of service and contracts\nare awarded to the lowest bidder.\nThe CREMA system operates on a performance, or output, rather than on payment for the\nquantity of work done. The minimum level of rehabilitation is specified by DNV and must be carried\nout within the first year of the contract (following detailed engineering design). Maintenance\nrequirements are specified and are regularly inspected (though inspection team size is minimized\nthrough the output specification). The requirements are categorized in the following way - potholes,\ncracking, rutting on pavement, condition of shoulders, culverts, drains, bridges, roadside,\nenvironment, horizontal and vertical signs. Penalties for non compliance on each item are\nestablished. The contracts are specified in this manner in part to ensure that the concessionaire\nhas an incentive to rehabilitate efficiently since he will then be required to maintain the road for the\nfull five year concession period.\nThe program covers around 14,400 km (in 100-300 km networks). 11,818km were let\nduring 1997 in 61 separate contracts, at about $1 1,000 per km/year. Rehabilitation is expected\nto account for approximately 75 percent of the total cost. Between 5 and 20 proposals were\nreceived for each package.\n2. Mexico\nThe Mexican Government awarded 53 concessions for 5,500 km between 1989 and 1994,\nthereby doubling the national toll road network. By the first quarter of 1995, 44 of these were in full\nor partial operation (5,120km).\nThe Secretary of Communications and Transport was responsible for the concessioning\nprogram. Concessions were let under the General Means of Communication law. The concessions\nwere not to exceed 15 years (later extended to 30 years) and a parallel free alternative to the\nhighway was required. Other state level road concessions were also awarded. These tended to be\nmodeled after the federal arrangements.\nSpecial purpose entities for the toll road projects were required, and these were typically\nconsortia of local construction firms (though they were not always special purpose entities in\npractice). The call for bids defined the project in terms of:\n\u2022     Alignment.\n\u2022 Location of interchanges and tollbooths.\n\u2022 Number of lanes.\n\u2022 Design and construction standards.\nThe Government supplied bidders with traffic and cost projections and basic designs. Bidders\nwere assessed on many criteria but were favored if they promised to transfer roads back to the\nGovernment in a short period. This was partly because of the concern that only short-term financing\nwould be available, but also because the administration was looking for \u2018success\u2019 within its period\nof office.\nThe concession agreement specified the tolls to be charged, by category of vehicle,\nwhich  were  to  increase  semi-annually  in  accordance  with  the  consumer  price  index", "Appendix 2, page 19\n(or whenever the CPI rose by 5 percent or more following the previous adjustment). Most toll\nchanges had to receive written approval from the government. Traffic levels were guaranteed by\ncategory of vehicle. Where the actual volumes fell short of the guaranteed levels,\nconcessionaires were entitled to request an extension to the concession to recover their\ninvestment.\nAs the concessions were initially set for very short periods (as short as three years in one\ncase) the concessionaires negotiated very high toll rates. Given these high tolls, forecast traffic did\nnot materialize and concession periods were extended.\nOther problems included:\n\u2022 Substantial construction cost overruns (for example, on the 267 km road from\nCuernavaca to Acapulco the cost over runs were around 200 percent and the time\ndelays about 30 months.). In some cases, this was because the concessionaires\nprovided \u201csweat equity\u201d. Originally this accounted for around 20 percent of the\ninvestment costs but as lenders demanded higher equity cushions so the construction\nbudgets rose.\n\u2022 Failure to concession a cohesive network so that long distance traffic was not attracted\nto the new roads.\n\u2022 Under-staffing at the Ministry of Communications and Transport which led to long permit\napproval times and inadequate enforcement of the requirements of the concession (for\nexample, bidders were required to post construction bonds but these were either not\nlodged or not effective)\n\u2022 A weak pre-qualification process which did not ensure that concessionaires had the\ntechnical capacity to plan and design the road. For example, some traffic projections\nwere that trucks would account for between 20 and 45 percent of the traffic. In fact,\ntrucks turned out to account for only about 5 percent. Anecdotal evidence suggests that\nthere was a black market in toll receipts which allowed truckers to use the free alternate\nroutes while pocketing the toll charges.)\n\u2022 Weak scrutiny from lending banks. Large amounts of non-recourse financing were\nprovided by government-owned commercial banks without undertaking their normal\nproject screening or appraisals. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this was because\nbanks understood that all projects would be supported by government even if they\nproved commercial failures. Even had the Banks been undertaking such due diligence,\ntheir negotiating position was weak since they were not allowed a collateral assignment\nof the concession agreement (i.e., they had no right to take over the infrastructure if\nthe sponsor firm collapsed)\n\u2022 Right-of-way acquisition was not completed before the construction began. Since\nopposition to the projects grew and acquisition became more problematic, construction\ncosts rose as machinery stood idle and interest costs increased.\n\u2022 Government reacted to local pressures by specifying change orders unilaterally.\n\u2022 Concessionaires did not avail themselves of the right to develop ancillary services (a\nright which extended for two years past the end of the concession) and paid little heed\nto the need to provide good access roads.", "Appendix 2, page 20\n\u2022 There tended to be very few bidders for each project (few international investors were\nattracted, in part because of their unfamiliarity with the Mexican legal system which\ngoverned the concessions \u2014 there was no recourse to international arbitration)\nThe December 1994 currency crisis in Mexico brought matters to a head, since traffic\nlevels dropped off steeply. By March 1995, only 5 of 32 projects which were operating could\nmeet their base case revenue projections. On average, actual project revenues were 30 percent\nbelow original projections. The companies were not marketing the time and distance savings\nthat the roads could provide, but even with this the very high tolls would have been significant\ndisincentives.\nBy early 1997 the World Bank\u2019s Operations Evaluation Department estimated that nearly\n40 projects (with $1 1.5 billion in equity and debt investments) had submitted requests to the\nGovernment for financial restructuring. In August 1997 the Government of Mexico announced a\nrestructuring package of around (US$8.9 billion for 23 projects). The government also planned to\nreduce tolls for cars and trucks by 15 percent and 35 percent, respectively.\nDespite all of these difficulties, three projects did successfully refinance before the 1994\ncrisis. The IFC was involved in the refinancing of the Toluca toll road in June 1992. Generally\ndespite high interest rates, the deal was not well received because of the tight debt service coverage\nratios and the currency risk. The two other projects to be re-financed were the Ecatepec-Pir\u00e1mides\nand Manzanillo Armeria roads and the Mexico City-Cuernavaca road.\n3. Colombia\nThere have been publicly-owned tolled roads in Colombia for many years. In 1993 two laws\nwere passed which now permit transport concessions. The Government has subsequently developed\na three-tier system of concessioned roads:\n\u2022 Expansion of existing roads.\n\u2022 New construction.\n\u2022 Road maintenance.\nOne particular objective of the program is to develop roads in those areas where economic\ndevelopment requires further development of the road network. The Government developed a\nstandard basic contract, which has been adapted for each of the tiers.\nOne of the criteria on which concessionaires are selected is the lowest proposed tariff.\nThe concessionaires, in theory, estimate the level of toll that they would require to cover the\ninvestment costs to achieve a \u201crate of return equivalent to that which would be achieved from\nanother project facing similar risks\u201d. If these tolls are deemed politically unacceptable, then the\nbidders must consider altering construction plans, the design of the construction, or requesting\ngovernment investment.\nThe Bogota to Villavicencio Road concession was signed in 1994. This consists of repairs\nto 13.5 km of road, construction of 34 km (including two tunnels), construction of two underpasses,\nrehabilitation of 7.5 km and various auxiliary works. The Government agreed to rehabilitate another\n55 km section of road and to build a new tunnel. The contract for all the work was divided into three\nstages \u2014 design and programming, construction, and operation. Each stage is of fixed duration\nand the contract ends at the end of the operating stage (16 years from the start of the project) when\nthe road reverts to Government at no charge.", "Appendix 2, page 21\nThere are several interesting aspects to the agreement:\n\u2022 Land acquisition - the National Roads Institute acquires the land for the concessionaire,\nthough this is paid for by the concessionaire. The cost of the land is specified in the\nconcession agreement, and the national roads fund is required to compensate the\nconcessionaire if the total cost rises above the agreed level.\n\u2022 Treatment of revenues - the tolls charged from the start of the operating period will\nrise with CPI, but only if the index moves 20 percent from the last adjustment, or once\na year. Though this is established in the concession agreement, the National Roads\nInstitute may refuse to grant permission, but must then compensate the\nconcessionaire. Minimum and maximum revenue streams for the concessionaire\nare also specified in the concession agreement (on the basis of traffic levels by vehicle\ntype). Where toll revenues are less than the minimum in any given year, the national\nroads institute compensates the concessionaire for the difference. Where the toll\nrevenues are greater than the maximum, then the concessionaire places 50 percent\nof the excess in a special account and the rest will be used to pay for additional\nmaintenance costs. The funds in the account will be used by the National Roads\nInstitute to pay the concessionaire when revenues fall below the minimum, or to fund\nadditional works.\n\u2022 Dealing with environmental permission processes - If this process is delayed, but the\nconcessionaire is not at fault, the concession is suspended until the end of the delay.\nWhere this seriously affects the economic position of the concessionaire, there are\ncompensation mechanisms in the concession agreement.\nDespite all these arrangements, there have been difficulties. Detailed engineering was\ncompleted within the specified period, but determined that the project cost would be far greater\nthan first thought. This led to renegotiation of the concession agreement. The Government too has\nfaced difficulties (cost overruns and delays) in undertaking its construction obligations.", "Appendix 2, page 22\nE. Eastern Europe\n1. Overview\nThe ambition to involve the private sector in funding the development of the road network in\nthe former Eastern Europe has not so far been fulfilled in practice. Table A2.2 identifies the road\nsector projects submitted to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) for\ntheir consideration and their current status. Of the eleven projects submitted, only two, both in\nHungary, have been implemented with private finance.\nThere are a number of reasons why most private sector transport infrastructure projects\nhave not reached fruition. EBRD cite the most important as:\n\u2022 Poor financial viability, particularly for motorway projects - projects may be\neconomically attractive but not financially viable without a contribution from the public\nauthorities. In the case of motorways, EBRD\u2019s experience is that upgrading roads\nto full motorway standards is likely to be economically and commercially viable for\nvery few (if any) sections, in the short to medium term, if rigorous evaluations are\nconducted. Despite initial hopes and aspirations, present income and traffic levels\nin the region are usually too low to generate sufficient toll revenue to service the\ndebt of a fully privately-financed facility.\n\u2022 Public affordability and political acceptability - political factors have been behind the lack\nof progress of some concession projects in the region:\n- It may not always be acceptable that transport infrastructure is provided by the\nprivate sector, usually involving foreign interests.\n- Proposed toll levels may be out of reach of local motorists traveling for their own\npurposes, rather than on corporate or other business, which will recompense toll\npayments. This can preclude political acceptability.\n- Governments may be reluctant to lose control of a strategic asset.\n- Bureaucrats may be reluctant to see the private sector take control of an asset on\nwhich they should continue to be employed.\n\u2022 Level and equitable allocation of risks - lenders may not be willing to take full traffic risk\narguing that it is properly an equity risk. They may therefore require support from the\nstate, in the form of:\n- Guarantees of a base level of traffic or revenue (Spain).\n- Provision of cash-flow deficiency guarantees (Hungary).\n- Linking the concession period to the outturn traffic volumes (Dartford Crossing and\nSecond Severn Crossing, United Kingdom (UK)).", "Appendix 2, page 23\nTable A2.2: Road Projects Submitted to EBRD for Consideration\nCOUNTRY           PROJECT COMMENT\nCroatia M12 Zagreb-Gorican Discussions under way with government\u2019s preferred tenderer\nSubject to review\nZagreb-Karlovac-Rijeka\nCzech D5 Motorway Concession tender canceled and project completed by the State\nRepublic\nHungary M1-M15 Toll Motorway private financing using BOT structure; M1 opened to traffic in January ;\n1996; outturn traffic about 40 per cent lower than forecast\nSzekszard Bridge Concession awarded, but project never reached financial closing, due\nto poor financial viability\nM5 Toll Motorway private financing using BOT structure; first section opened to traffic\nDecember 1996\nM3 Toll Motorway having tendered the project as a BOT concession, the government\ndecided in September 1995 to cancel the tender and build the\nmotorway as a state sector project\nM7 Toll Motorway Concession tenders submitted; government reviewing options\nPoland A-2 Motorway two concession tenders submitted\nConcession\nA-4 Motorway Operating Preferred tenderer selected by government\nConcession\nRomania Initial motorway Concession advertised July 1996\nconcession\nEBRD\u2019s past experience with the M1/M15 Motorway in Hungary (see Case Study below)\nmay lead it to require project sponsors or the host state to bear traffic risk. Where substantial\npublic support is required to a privately-funded scheme, conflicts can arise, reflected in legal\narrangements and risk premiums and adverse effects on project development and\nimplementation.\n\u2022 Lack of equity - returns to shareholders in early years can be limited by long construction\nperiods, debt service obligations, and slow traffic/revenue build-up. For the M5 Motorway\nin Hungary, first dividend payments are permitted only 10 years after financial closing.\nThus, only those with a construction interest are likely to invest, which leads to conflicts\nof interest difficult to control. Competing investment opportunities are likely to be more\nattractive.\n\u2022 Lack of local funding - for projects that generate mainly local revenues, part of the debt\nhas to be denominated in local currency to limit exposure to currency devaluation and\ninflation risks. Local financial and capital markets in the region are generally insufficiently\ndeveloped for this type of funding. EBRD supported local funding instruments for the\nM1/M15 Motorway in Hungary such that 50 percent of the debt is denominated in local\ncurrency. Otherwise the host-state might guarantee a fixed exchange rate (as in Spain).\n\u2022 Regulatory and legal constraints - ideally there will be a concession law in place. In the\nabsence of such a law, lenders will require various security arrangements, the absence\nof which will reduce their willingness to participate.", "Appendix 2, page 24\n\u2022 Lack of convincing examples from Western Europe - most of the Central European\ncountries look to Western Europe for examples of privately financed infrastructure.\nUnfortunately, there are few examples and success has been mixed.\nEBRD now believes there are likely to be few (if any) financially viable motorway concessions\nin the region in the next five years or so, without substantial public sector financial support. EBRD\nwill continue to aim to mobilize private finance for transport infrastructure through concessions and\npublic/private partnerships. But it expects opportunities to be limited and to focus more on co-\nfinancing operating assets and transport services, leaving infrastructure financing to, say, the World\nBank and European Investment Bank which have mandates for sovereign lending.\n2. Case Studies\nCase studies of the two motorway projects in Eastern Europe which have been implemented\nusing private funding, both in Hungary, are presented below, together with the current situation in\nPoland as another case study. The conclusions from these case studies and the experience generally\nin Eastern Europe are set out below.\n3. Conclusions\nThe three case study examples presented below provide common themes which illustrate\nthe problems associated with involving the private sector in developing the region\u2019s motorway\nnetwork:\n\u2022 Governments had, and may still have, ambitious plans for the development of\ncomprehensive motorway networks utilizing private finance.\n\u2022 Current levels of income (gross domestic product (GDP)/capita is currently estimated\nat US$6,500-US$7,S00 in both Poland and Hungary) and vehicle ownership/usage\ngenerate toll motorway daily traffic flows in the range of 7,000-10,000.\n\u2022 Initial traffic forecasts in support of concession bids have often been substantially higher.\n\u2022 The construction of motorways in Eastern Europe is not significantly cheaper than in\nWestern Europe where vehicle ownership and incomes, and therefore the ability and\nwillingness to pay tolls, are higher.\n\u2022 It follows that the private sector cannot bear all of the traffic/revenue risks. Substantial\ngovernment contributions, of up to 50 percent of project costs, are required to make\nprojects bankable.\n\u2022 Lenders will be increasingly reluctant to participate in such projects without independent\ntraffic forecasts on which to base financing decisions and government contribution to a\npublic/private partnership.\n\u2022 The EBRD foresees few, if any, privately-funded motorway projects proceeding in the\nformer Eastern Europe in the next few years.", "Appendix 2, page 25\nCASE STUDY: M1/M15 MOTORWAY, HUNGARY\nThe Project\n\u2022 43 km of dual 2-lane motorway linking an existing, untolled 126 km of motorway in\nHungary with 60 km in Austria, to complete Budapest-Vienna link (M1).\n\u2022 14 km spur towards Bratislava (M15), one carriageway to be completed by December\n1997, the second by December 2002.\n\u2022 M1 opened at the beginning of 1996 as the first tolled motorway in the former Eastern\nEurope.\nImplementation Process\n\u2022 Long term motorway development plan approved by Hungarian Government in 1991.\nM1/M15 identified as suitable for limited recourse project financing.\n\u2022 5 consortia shortlisted in 1992, 4 bids submitted.\n\u2022 2 preferred tenderers selected in Nov 92, winner selected in Feb 93.\n\u2022 Contract signed in April 93, financial closing in December 93.\nGovernment Contribution\n\u2022 Preliminary design, building permits, environmental clearance.\n\u2022 Land (about 5 percent of project cost).\n\u2022 Undertaking of no tolls on existing 126 km of motorway prior to 2005.\n\u2022 Acceptance of phased approach, eg, M15 second carriageway.\n\u2022 Some restrictions of HGV movements on parallel road.\nConcession Terms\n\u2022 Total project cost was ECU 329 million (US$325 million): construction costs = 67 percent,\nconcession company\u2019s costs = 18 percent, capitalized interest = 15 percent.\n\u2022 Concession terms required equity to be at least 20 percent of project cost.\n\u2022 All commercial, operational and financial risks borne by concessionaire and debt\nproviders.

United Kingdom\nThe UK\u2019s motorway network was developed largely in the 1960s and 1970s with few\nexceptions as an untolled, publicly-financed motorway network. While parts of Continental Europe,\nnotably France, Italy and Spain, were developing tolled motorway networks employing private sector\nfunding, tolls were considered and not pursued in the UK for the following principal reasons:\n\u2022 The density of development in the UK and the density of the road network led to concerns\nthat the imposition of tolls would divert substantial numbers of trips from motorways to\nparallel roads, giving a reduction in efficiency and leaving the motorways underused.\n\u2022 The density of the road network and hence the large number of intersections on the\nmotorway network would have led to high toll collection costs.\nThere, exceptions to the general rule of an untolled motorway network are, estuarial\ncrossings, the Birmingham Northern Relief Road, and, of greatest interest, the recent DBFO Road\nprogram.\nEstuarial Crossings\nMajor estuarial crossings were tolled on the grounds that they were expensive pieces of\ninfrastructure to build and they provided users with substantial savings through the avoidance of\nlong, circuitous journeys via the nearest upstream crossing. By the late 1980s, there were 11 tolled\nestuarial crossings, funded by the public sector through grant and loans. The total debt in the early\n1980s exceeded \u00a3400 million and annual interest payments were not being covered by net revenues.\nInterest was being capitalized and was unlikely to be fully paid.\nSecond Dartford Crossing. The private sector became involved in the funding of the road\nnetwork when the Dartford River Crossing Ltd. (with Trafalgar House, now Kvaerner, as a major\npartner) funded, almost exclusively through debt not equity, and built the Queen Elizabeth II\nBridge at Dartford. Dartford River Crossing\u2019s concession allowed them to collect the toll\nrevenues from the existing tunnels and the new bridge for a period up to the full repayment of\nthe debt. The new bridge opened in October 1991 and the debt is expected to be repaid in the\nyear 2000. At that point, under the legislation now in place, the crossings will revert to the\npublic sector, tolls will continue for a year to develop a fund for maintenance, then tolls will be\nwithdrawn.\nSecond Severn Crossing. This is conceptually similar to the Second Dartford Crossing.\nSevern River Crossing Ltd has bought the concession to operate the existing bridge and toll both\nbridges for a period of 30 years.\nOther than these estuarial crossings, the only attempt at a tolled section of motorway in the\nUK to date has been the Birmingham Northern Relief Road.\nBirmingham Northern Relief Road\nThe Birmingham Northern Relief Road was planned in the 1980s as a relief road for one of\nthe more congested sections of the UK\u2019s motorway network in the conurbation of Birmingham,\nwhich has a population of around 2 million. The proposed Birmingham Northern Relief Road was\naround 40 km long, it was considered at Public Inquiry in 1988 and was intended to be the first", "Appendix 2, page 30\nroad in the UK subject to a competition for private sector design, construction, finance and\noperation.\nFollowing pre-qualification, three groups were invited to submit bids for the concession by\nOctober 1990. In August 1991 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with the successful\nbidder, Midland Expressway Ltd (MEL).\nMEL reviewed the alignment and junction arrangements of the preferred route from the\n1988 Inquiry and proposed changes. Consultation on these changes with local authorities,\ngovernment departments and the public was required to satisfy the government that the proposals\ncould pass through the statutory planning process. Some substantial changes were made to the\nproposals as a result of the consultation process. The new preferred scheme was then resubmitted\nto the planning process in 1992. 6 years later it is still subject to appeal.\nIt is reminiscent of Catch 22. Innovative ideas are required from the private sector. If\nthese affect scheme designs, requiring a change in published orders or new orders, schemes\nhave to go back through the planning process. But it is the public sector that is best equipped to\ntake schemes through the planning process, and the private sector would prefer not to get involved\nuntil all such procedures are completed. How then can a private sector contribution to scheme\ndesign be obtained?\nDesign-Build-Finance-Operate (DBFO) Schemes\nThe DBFO process was announced in December 1993, and the first four contracts were\nlet in 1996. Now eight contracts have been let, in two tranches, and some \u00a31 billion of finance\nraised. Under these contracts, private sector concessionaires build, operate and maintain sections\nof trunk roads or motorways over 30 years. In return, the concessionaires are paid by the\ngovernment according to the number of vehicle kilometers driven on the road. Road users will\nnot pay directly for using the road. This payment mechanism has come to be described as\n\u2018shadow tolls\u2019.\n1. Objectives\nThe intentions of the government, represented by the Highways Agency (HA), in letting the\ncontracts, were:\n\u2022 New roads to be designed and constructed, and the new and existing roads to be\nmaintained and operated safely and satisfactorily so as to minimize any adverse impact\non the environment.\n\u2022 Test the enthusiasm of the market for such contracts across a range of scheme types.\n\u2022 Assist in the establishment of a road operating industry within the private sector.\n\u2022 Promote innovation.\n\u2022 Maximize value for money through the use of a competitive process and by allocating\nrisks between the public and private sectors in the most appropriate manner.\nIn the remainder of this section we comment on:\n\u2022 The shadow toll payment mechanism.", "Appendix 2, page 31\n\u2022 The variety of projects being implemented under DBFO.\n\u2022 The risks, particularly traffic risk, borne by the concessionaire.\n\u2022 The DBFO bidding process, which has been thoroughly audited and praised by the\nNational Audit Office.\n\u2022 The use of public sector comparators in that process.\n\u2022 Whether the intentions of establishing a road operating industry and promoting innovation\nare being realized.\n2. Shadow Toll Payment Mechanism\nThe shadow toll payments are made by the government to the concessionaire on the basis\nof the vehicle kilometers traveled on the defined section of road by vehicles in two categories -\nheavy goods vehicles and other vehicles. Bidders had to put forward their required payment per\nvehicle km:\n\u2022 By the two vehicle categories.\n\u2022 In each of four bands (payment for the first x million vehicle km, the next y million, etc).\n\u2022 With a zero payment specified for band 4, i.e., vehicle km in excess of the upper bound\nof band 3 which was specified by the bidder.\nA key evaluation criterion was the HA\u2019s estimation of the required payments to each bidder\nusing the HA\u2019s traffic forecasts and each bidder\u2019s proposed payments schedule.\na. Variety of DBFO Projects\nThe initial DBFO projects have varied in their size and in their nature, in the balance\nbetween initial construction and on-going maintenance. For the first four schemes, the present\nvalues of expected payments range from \u00a362 million-\u00a3232 million (US$100 million-US$372\nmillion): the length of new road construction varies from 3 km to 52 km. The initial four\nschemes were all inter-urban schemes. As experience of the DBFO process is gained,\nconsideration is being given to DBFO projects in urban or pen-urban areas and to DBFO\nprojects which have no new construction but consist solely of maintain-finance-operate\ncontracts.\nb. Risk Transfer\nTraffic risk was largely passed to the selected bidder. The zero payment for traffic in excess\nof defined volumes limited the government\u2019s exposure. But the nature of shadow tolls and the\nDBFO schemes limits the traffic risk to the concessionaire:\n\u2022 There are no user tolls or payments, which removes a major component of the traffic/\nrevenue risk for a conventional tolled expressway.\n\u2022 DBFO schemes to date have more often been the on-line improvement of an existing\nsection of the trunk road/motorway network than the development of new routes, which\nreduces the modelling/forecasting risk.", "Appendix 2, page 32\n\u2022 Nevertheless, the payment to the concessionaire is related to the traffic volume, which\ncontributed to the DBFO projects satisfying the UK Treasury and European Union rules\non the transfer of risk to the private sector as a necessary PFI condition.\nFor the initial DBFO projects, the public sector bore the planning risk, since all the projects\nhad been taken through statutory planning stages as public sector projects. The following risks\nwere shared between the public and private sectors:\n\u2022 Traffic risk. As discussed, the private sector bears the downside risk and the public\nsector bears the capped upside risk.\n\u2022 Protester action. On some projects it is borne by the concessionaire, on others it is\nshared.\n\u2022 Force Majeure. Most force majeure risks lie with the public sector, but equity holders\nare not compensated if termination occurs as a result of a force majeure event.\nThe concessionaire bears the following risks:\n\u2022 Design and construction.\n\u2022 Latent/inherent defects which arise during 30 year concession period.\n\u2022 Delivery/timing, unless due to government-required changes, in which case\ncompensation may be payable.\n\u2022 Operation and maintenance.\n\u2022 Indemnity/insurance.\n\u2022 Legislative, except where the law is discriminatory against operators or DBFO roads.\nConcessionaires would be compensated, for example, if real tolls were introduced\ncausing traffic volumes to fall.\nc. DBFO Bidding Process\nThe public sector had taken the DBFO schemes through statutory planning stages. The\ninterest of the market in the DBFO schemes was stimulated through a consultation process and\nmarket sounding exercise, conducted by the HA\u2019s professional advisors who were appointed in\ngood time at the start of the DBFO process. The road construction industry\u2019s interest was also\nstimulated since it was made clear that new roads would be DBFO-funded, there would be no\npublicly-funded road schemes. Four bidders were invited to bid for each of the four schemes in the\ninitial tranche; no bidder was invited for more than two schemes. A model contract was drawn up\nto which bidders could respond. There was a clear set of evaluation criteria, with the payment level\nand banding process described earlier at its heart. Best and final offers were sought from the\nshortlisted bidders and competitive pressure was maintained through continued negotiation with\ntwo bidders for each scheme right up to contract award. An ex-post survey revealed that bidders\nwere broadly satisfied with the process.\nOn the first tranche of four schemes, the HA spent \u00a38.3 million (US$13.3 million) on its\nadvisors - financial, legal and technical. The bidders estimated their costs as:\n\u2022 Prequalification - up to \u00a30.1 million (US$ 0.16 million).\n\u2022 Shortlisted Bidder - \u00a31 million-\u00a32 million (US$1 .6 million-US$3.2 million).", "Appendix 2, page 33\n\u2022 Reserve or Winning Bidder - \u00a31 milIion-\u00a34 million (US$1.6 million-US$6.4 million)\nd. Use of Public Sector Comparators\nFigure A2.3 shows, for each of the first four DBFO schemes, three sets of values, all\nexpressed as NPVs discounted at 8 percent per annum:\n\u2022 Shortlisted bids. The NPV of expected payments calculated for the individual bids on\neach project.\n\u2022 NPV of expected payments. The NPVs of expected payments to the Winning Bidders\non each project, expressed as a best estimate and as a range dependent on traffic flow.\n\u2022 Public sector comparators. Two estimates, one by the Highways Agency and one by its\ntechnical advisors, of the costs to the Agency of acquiring the project as a conventional\npublic sector project.\nTypically, the public sector comparator has a higher value than the NPV of expected payments,\nleading to the conclusion that the involvement of the private sector has given value for money,\nproducing considerable savings to the public purse. The greatest savings apparently relate to the\nA1-M1 project where the best estimate of expected payments (\u00a3232 million) falls substantially\nbelow the two public sector comparators (\u00a3326 million and \u00a3339 million). It is not clear why this\nproject should apparently cost so much less than the public sector comparators, though it is believed\nthat it has been subject to heavy \u2018value engineering\u2019. There remains a concern that, despite project\ndesigns and standards being tightly specified by the public sector, and construction and maintenance\nclosely monitored, an inferior product will be delivered that will ultimately rebound on the public\nsector.\ne. Establishment of Road Operating Industry and Innovation\nTraditionally in the UK, there have been separate organizations specializing in road\nconstruction (normally in the private sector) and maintenance (historically in the public sector but\nincreasingly being privatized). Overlap between these two is beginning, with major contractors\ndeveloping their road maintenance sections or acquiring maintenance organizations. The\nconsideration being given to maintain-finance-operate projects will encourage this process. It is\nsignificant, however, that the initial DBFO companies, all led by construction companies, all negotiated\nthe right to sell their equity after five years, suggesting that, as yet, the construction companies are\nnot wholly committed to a long term involvement in road operation and maintenance.\nThere has, so far, been limited innovation. Project plans and the orders following public\ninquiries constrained designs. Non-conforming bids were made to the Agency who gave details to\nthe other bidders, allowing them to bid on the same basis. If innovative thinking results in a change\nto core technical requirements, which should in any event be kept to a minimum, it is preferable for\nthe change to be made where its cost or value is still subject to competitive pressure.", "Figure A2.3:    Performance of UK DBFO Projects\nExpected payment to Bidders:\nA B C A B C A B C A B C\nA = Short listed bids\nB = Winning Bidder\n      (best estimate and range\n      depending on traffic)\n400\nC = Public Sector Comparator\n      (2 estimates)\n(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)374\n339\n326\n300\nm (cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)288 <281\n\u00a3\nV  (cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)258\nP\nN O 232\n(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)224 (cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)217\n200 (cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)204 204\n195\n>186\n(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)167 <165\nO 154\n>138\n(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)126 <124\n(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)118 O 112\n100 >106 112110\n(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)79\n<66\n(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)(cid:110)60 C 62\n< 58 54\n49\nA\np\np\ne\nM1 - A1 A1(M) A419/A417 A69 n\nd\nNew Scheme Widening New/Widening Mantenance ix\n 2\n, p\nAll NPVs calculated with 8% discount rate a\ng\ne\n 3\n4", "Appendix 2, page 35\nG. France, Italy, Spain\nThere are strong similarities in the experience of these three countries which were at the\nforefront of the development of toll motorway networks and involving the private sector in their\ndevelopment. The principal similarities are:\n\u2022 Each country has a substantial toll motorway network.\n\u2022 The impetus in each case came in the 1950s and 1960s in response to a number of\nfactors (reconstruction following the Second World War, response to rapidly increasing\nvehicle ownership and the development of infrastructure to support developing industrial\nand tourism activity).\n\u2022 In each country both the public and the private sectors have been involved in the financing\nof the toll motorway network.\n\u2022 The involvement of the public sector in the ownership of the motorway networks in each\ncase had to be strengthened as private sector concessionaires experienced financial\ndifficulty, particularly following the energy crisis in the early 1970s.\n\u2022 Now the toll motorway networks in these three countries are owned in varying degrees\nby the public and private sectors, with considerable government financial support and\nprofit controls on the private sector operations.\nTable A2.3 summarizes the toll motorway experience in these three countries.\n1. France\nThere is a toll motorway network of approximately 5,000 km mainly developed in the 1 960s\nand 1 970s. The first concessions were awarded in the period 1956-1963 to five Societes d\u2019Economie\nMixte (SEMs) which are commercially structured, state owned bodies, a mix of national and local\ngovernment ownership. In 1969, four private sector concession companies were founded. Economic\nproblems following the energy crisis in the early 1 970s caused financial difficulties for these\ncompanies and in 1982 the government bought them, with the exception of Cofiroute, and converted\nthem into SEMs. An \u2018equalization\u2019 policy was introduced, with a public entity Autoroutes de France,\ncreated to manage surpluses and deficits, and ensure balanced financial operations. Currently,\nCofiroute, the one remaining concessionaire not wholly publiclyowned, owns around 15 percent of\nthe toll motorway network.", "Table A2.3: Toll Motorway Experience in France, Italy, and Spain\nNetwork Characteristics France Italy Spain\nRoute-kms 5,000 5,000 1,900\n% of Total Motorway Network 72 81 80\n% Privately-owned 15 - Cofiroute 2 85\nHistory \u20221956-63: Concessions to SEMs \u2022 1960s/70s - majority of toll network \u2022 mid 1960s/early 1970s\nbuilt Concessions let\n\u20221969: 4 Private Sector Concession\nCompanies \u2022 Autostrade S.p.A. set up to manage \u2022 1983/84 state buys 3 (out of 13)\n45% of motorway network, but share concession companies\n\u20221982: Concession Companies other grew as Autostrade took over loss-\nthan Cofiroute bought by government making roads.\nand converted to SEMs.  Equalization\npolicy\nState Involvement in Financing \u2022Repayable advances \u2022 Capital subsidies \u2022 Government stipulations on funding\nsources\n\u2022Equity (State to hold a majority of \u2022 Loan guarantees\nequity) \u2022 Exchange rate support\n\u2022Loan guarantees \u2022 Government guarantees for foreign\nborrowing\n\u2022 Interest free loans when traffic\ntarget not met\n\u2022 Tax benefits to concession\ncompanies\nProfit Control \u20227% limit on dividends \u2022 Limit on dividends of 8% of share \u2022 Profit limited to 10-15% of equity\ncapital\n\u2022Excess profits to Autoroutes de \u2022 Excess profits to companies\u2019\nFrance \u2022 Excess profits to Central Guarantee Special Reserve A\nFund p\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n 2\n, p\na\ng\ne\n 3\n6", "Appendix 2, page 37\nThe state has been heavily involved in financing the construction of the toll motorway network.\nConstruction was financed largely by long term loans, with State support in the form of repayable\nadvances, loan guarantees and equity (the State was to hold a majority of the equity). The SEMs in\nthe 1 960s received advances nominally repayable over a long period, to cover 30 percent - 40\npercent of their construction costs and to cover unforeseen annual deficits. In the1970s, indexed\nbut non-interest bearing advances of around 20 percent - 25 percent of construction costs were\nmade to public and private sector companies. State guarantees of up to 70 percent of loan financing\nwere provided to both public and private sector companies.\nThe SEMs now operate under a profit control regime that allows them to distribute\ndividends of up to 7 percent, with excess profits being paid to Autoroutes de France for use in\nthe equalization operation.\n2. Italy\nItaly has some 5,000 km of toll motorway mainly built in the late 1960s and early 1970s. By\nfar the single largest concessionaire is Autostrade S.p.A. whose parent company is the State-\ncontrolled State Institute of Industrial Reconstruction. Autostrade was set up to manage some 45\npercent of the Italian motorway network. By contrast, many of the other motorway concessions\nwere awarded to companies which held only a single concession. Often the award was made on\nthe basis of negotiation with a preferred bidder rather than as a result of competitive tender.\nAutostrade\u2019s share of the motorway network has grown as it has taken over loss making roads in\nreturn for an extension to its concession.\nState involvement in the financing of motorways has included capital subsidies, variously\nreported as less than 10 percent of the sum invested in the period to 1986 and typically 10 percent\n- 30 percent of construction costs, and loan guarantees. All of Autostrade\u2019s loans are guaranteed\nby the State Institute of Industrial Reconstruction.\nANAS, the autonomous national highway agency, approves the financial plans and monitors\nthe annual accounts of the toll road companies. Dividends are limited by law to 8 percent of share\ncapital. Excess profits are paid into a Central Guarantee Fund to provide collateral for loans.\n3. Spain\nSpain has a toll motorway network of around 1,900 km begun in the 1960s. By 1972,\nconcessions totaling 1,000 km had been granted. The adverse effects of the energy crisis and\neconomic problems in the 1970s were met by the renegotiation of concession terms and by the\nState taking over three (out of 13) companies granted concessions.\nAll of the companies whose concessions were granted by the national government (9 out of\nthe 13) enjoy special tax benefits which reduce certain taxes and duties by up to 95 percent.\nThe Government laid down stipulations for the financing of toll roads. In order to limit the\nuse of local debt, minimum amounts of foreign debt and equity were specified. There are variations\namong concessions, but typically 45 percent of construction costs must be funded with foreign\ndebt and 10 percent - 25 percent with equity. In return, Government supports the concessionaires\u2019\noverseas borrowings through exchange rate assurance, whereby the Government undertakes to\nprovide the foreign exchange to service foreign debt at the rate of exchange ruling at the time the\nloan was entered into.", "Appendix 2, page 38\nIn addition, Government guarantees a limited amount of foreign borrowing, for a fee, and\nprovides some subsidies. It has made interest-free loans to one private sector concessionaire in\nyears when traffic levels have fallen below a stipulated target. Advances have been made to\npublic sector companies to cover operating deficits.\nConcessionaires must each establish a Special Reserve into which they make an\nallocation of funds when net profit is greater than 10 percent - 15 percent of equity. There are\nrestrictions on the use of the reserve. Payments into and out of the reserve tend to restrict\ndividends to 6 percent - 15 percent of paid-up capital.", "Appendix 2, page 39\nH. United States\nTolling or private sector provision of roads has been out of favor in the US from the early\n1950s when the Inter State Highway system was instigated. However, since the late 1980s the\nwhole issue has been revived, and by the early 1 990s several concession agreements had been\nsigned. All concessions have been awarded at the state level.\n1. California\nThe State of California has been leading this renaissance, with the first BOT road\nprojects in the country. All of the roads revert to Caltrans (the state DOT on substantial\ncompletion) and in most cases are operated through the Transportation Corridor Agencies\n(TCA) founded in 1986. The concession legislation was passed in July 1989 to allow the four\nnew concession agreements.\nSR 91 opened in December 1995 and was the first privately funded electronically tolled\nproject in the US. There are four new express lanes, 16km long, in the median of an existing state\nroad. The road is operated by California Private Transportation Company, under a 35-year\nconcession. There was a competitive bidding process, which called for ideas for private roads and\nselected those deemed technically and financially the most viable. The concession was signed at\nthe end of 1991 but financial closure only came at the beginning of 1993. In part, the process took\na considerable time, because the Government had adopted a flexible approach to project award, in\nwhich the preferred bidder and Government negotiated the final elements of the concession (with\nthe runner-up bidders held in reserve) over a period of months. This form of contract award was\nselected on the basis that it provided the government with the benefits of both innovative project\ndesign and risk sharing schemes.\nThe concessionaire and state signed the concession agreement on the understanding that\nthe outcome of the environmental review process might conclude that the no build option was\npreferable. Caltrans has agreed not to issue any competing concession (within a defined zone\naround the project), that it will not develop anything itself, and that it will use its best efforts to ensure\nthat no other agencies develop any such facilities. The concessionaire has rights to ancillary real\nestate development, though if they use the air space they have to pay $1 per annum rent for the first\n35 years and after than a \u201cfair market lease rate\u201d.\nThere are several performance incentive clauses in the concession agreement \u2014\nincluding the number of vehicles using the facility, the number of accidents on the road and the\nmagnitude of the operations and maintenance costs. The incentive is paid in the form of\nincreases in the permitted annual return on investment.\nThe project cost US$126 million (US$7.9 million per kilometer). US$107 million of debt was\nraised, giving a debt equity ratio of 85/15. Equity participation, through California Private Transportation\nCompany, came from Cofiroute, a French toll road operating company. US$7 million in subordinated\ndebt was provided by Orange County (the local authority in the region).\nOn opening, tolls varied with the time of day and day of week, between $0.25 and $2.50 for\nthe full length of the road. There is no toll rate regulation, though there is a maximum 17 percent\nceiling on the return to total capital (debt and equity combined). No tolls are charged for cars\ncarrying three or more people. Tolls are paid using a FasTrak in-vehicle tag, which are now also\nused on all of the TCA roads to ensure that all users in Southern California only require a single tag\nin their vehicle. Traffic rose from around 8,000 vehicles on an average weekday in January 1996, to\naround 25,000 by the end of the year.", "Appendix 2, page 40\n2. Other Schemes\nUS State Departments of Transportation have long issued bonds with which to fund roads\nand bridges (around US$40 million since 1950). The TCA approach allows such bonds to be issued\non a non recourse basis and to secure them solely on the basis of the toll revenues.\nTwo TCAs have been created in Orange County, California with the express purpose of\n\u201cProviding significant relief to Orange County\u2019s gridlock\u201d. The TCAs are the San Joaquin Hills\nTransportation Corridor and the Foothill and Eastern Transportation Corridor.\nConstruction began in September 1993 and the San Joaquin Hills Corridor was fully opened\nin November 1996, four months ahead of schedule. It is 15 km long (with three lanes in each\ndirection and a wide median allowing for future HOV or public transport lanes) and runs parallel to\nInterstate 5. A turnkey (design/build) approach was used and the road is operated and maintained\nby the TCA.\nThe construction cost US$834 million, not including right of way, finance or administrative\ncosts which were funded from development impact fees, state general funds and the gas tax. In\nMarch 1993, the TCA raised US$1 .2 billion in tax exempt, non recourse toll revenue bonds.\nFasTrak tags can be used and the toll is distance based and for the full length of the corridor\n(for a car or motorcycle) is US$2. This is estimated to save 20 minutes from the Interstate 5 route.\nThere are five vehicle classes.\nFoothill and Eastern Transportation Corridor is in fact two schemes, which were cofinanced\nunder two bond issues, which were not backed by any Government body and are funded simply\nfrom the toll revenues, development fees and interest earnings:\n\u2022 In 1993, US$78.6 million of fixed and variable rate, non recourse, toll revenue bonds\nwas sold to finance the completion of the first section of Foothill-North (1.4 miles). The\ndesign and environmental costs of the other parts of the Foothill corridor and for all of\nthe Eastern corridor (other funds for construction came from the state and from\ndevelopment impact fees.\n\u2022 Similar bonds were sold in June 1995 to raise a further US$1.5 billion. These bonds,\ntogether with some more state and developer funding and the remains of he 1993 issue,\npaid for the Eastern corridor and completion of the Northern Foothills corridor, as well\nas the design of the southern part of the Foothills corridor.\nThe toll for the Northern Section of the Foothills corridor (7.5 miles) is US$1 for cars and\nmotorbikes. These are lower if only part of the corridor is used, varying from 25 to 75 cents depending\non distance. There are 7 classes of vehicle.\nBasic tolls for the Eastern Corridor will average 19 cents to 25 cents per mile. The project\nis expected to be complete by December 1999, when it will be 24 miles long and consist of two\nlanes in each direction. Traffic is expected to increase and plans have been made for 3-4 lanes\nin each direction. The total design and construction cost of the corridor, and 4.6 miles of the\nFoothill corridor, is US$743.2 million. A turnkey (design/build) structure has been used for\nconstruction.", "Appendix 2, page 41\nI. Australasia\n1. Australia\nThere has been some experience with BOT style investments in Australia - see Table A2.4.\nMostly urban projects, these have included the Sydney Harbour tunnel, the M2, M4, and M5\nmotorways. Melbourne City Link is currently under construction, and completion is expected in\n1999. The total cost of these projects is more than A$3.5 billion (with the Melbourne City Link\nestimated to require around A$1 .8 billion of this over five years.) This can be compared with total\nannual expenditure of A$1 billion on all roads in the state of Victoria.\nGovernment involvement in these projects has been substantial in some cases \u2014involving\nthe transfer of land, provision of financing and underwriting of revenue.\nFour major Australian Banks (National Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia,\nANZ Bank and Westpac Banking) have been involved in providing the finance and in underwriting\nprojects. International involvement has commenced with the Melbourne project.\nThe New South Wales Auditor-General has prepared reports considering the\nperformance of all of the Sydney projects. These reports raised particular concerns about the\nnature of the road network within which the BOT project operates and the implications of this\nfor risk sharing between Government and concessionaires. However, offsetting this has been\nthe considerable competition for the projects, which is believed to have lowered costs and\nfostered innovation. Similarly the use of the private sector has encouraged swifter construction\n\u2014 the M4 was completed nine months ahead of schedule and the M5 was completed in 2\nrather than 4 years.\nRisks for the private sector have been ameliorated through Material Adverse Effect clauses\nin the BOT contracts. These typically provide for a menu of responses that escalate from toll\nchanges to concession extensions to direct government financial compensation. However there\nare some protections for government in these clauses \u2014 for example, the Material Adverse Effect\nclauses of the City Link project do not require the government to compensate the developer if a\ncompeting heavy rail link is built. On the Melbourne City Link the government has also taken on\nenvironmental risks, in that the concessionaire will be compensated if any unidentified pollution or\nland contamination is discovered.", "Table A2.4: Australia: BOT Expressways\nProject           Status               Cost               Length Description\nSydney Construction began \u2022 Construction cost 4 lanes 2.3km north-south \u2022 Concession to 2022\nHarbour 1988, opened A$760million of harbor\n\u2022 Kumagai Gumi and Transfield as Sydney Harbour Tunnel Company\nTunnel August 1992 \u2022 Interest free\nsubordinated loan \u2022 Toll capped by bridge toll in 1987 at $1 and linked to CPI increases.

For example 22 separate contractual\ndocuments were required for the M2 project, for which A$21 0 million of private equity was raised at\na cost of A$16 million. These costs included underwriting costs, legal costs and the cost of financial\nadvice.\nSome reductions in economic benefit have been perceived, as a result of contract structures.\nFor example, on the MS project, four proposed interchanges have not been built, in order to ensure\nthat toll plazas cannot be avoided and will not be built until after the financial requirements have\nbeen met. In addition, network costs are high \u2014 in Sydney there are three different types of tolling\ntechnology.\nSince 1990, RTA of New South Wales has been trying alternative arrangements to meet its\nmission statement - \u201cTo manage road related transport infrastructure to provide safe and efficient\naccess to the road network for the people of New South Wales\u201d.\nInitially it contracted out for maintenance management and some maintenance delivery on\ntwo networks in Sydney. These were not performance-based contracts since the authority took the\nview that:\n\u2022 The risks of performance based contracts were too high when there was no proven\nprivate sector expertise in road maintenance.\n\u2022 There was no sufficiently good register of existing asset condition on which to base the\ncontracts.\nRTA staff continued to deliver maintenance on one of the two networks, thereby providing\neasy comparison of quality and price. Contracts were signed for two years.\nThe management contracts were structured on a \u201cCode of Practice\u201d. This determined the\ntechnical specifications and the intervention standards required of the managers.\nThe concerns of the RTA going into the contracts were all satisfied including:\n\u2022 The emergency response capability of the contractor.\n\u2022 The quality of the maintenance work.\n\u2022 The network management processes used by the maintenance manager (which in fact\nwere deemed to have improved on those of the RTA and have been adopted by them).\n\u2022 Ongoing maintenance of the assets and level of service over the life of the contracts.\n\u2022 The cost of the maintenance work. This was around 16 percent lower than cost of RTA\nmaintenance initially, though over the course of the contract the RTA costs fell by 22\npercent.", "Appendix 2, page 45\nIn 1993, the RTA determined to re-bid the contracts for a further 2 years. Several bids were\nreceived, though the incumbents were all successful in retaining their contracts. The average\nprices fell again, and were 25 percent lower than on the first contracts.\nBy 1994, RTA confidence had grown such that it decided to embark on a performance\nbased form of contract. Its objectives were defined as:\n\u2022 Improving the condition of its road assets and/or reducing total recurrent maintenance\ncosts.\n\u2022 Enhancing and developing skills in the road industry for effective management and\ndelivery of road asset maintenance.\n\u2022 Equitably allocating risk between the RTA and contractors.\n\u2022 Developing and implementing a simply, effective contract which was precise,\nmanageable and allowed \u201cpartnering\u201d.\n\u2022 Developing and encouraging appropriate innovating road maintenance practice.\nThe RTA wanted to see innovation in the bids and therefore specified little in the call for\n\u201cconcept proposals\u201d except:\n\u2022 The geographic extent (450km) of the network to be maintained under the contract. The\nnetwork was selected on the basis of allowing an acceptable cash flow which would\nalso minimize management and investment costs, and ensure a suitable distribution of\nconstruction type, age, condition, and usage to minimize the risk exposure of the\ncontractor.\n\u2022 The duration (between 5 and 15 years).\n\u2022 The current RTA maintenance budget for the network.\n\u2022 That a quality assurance form of contract was required.\nThe RTA also gave all interested parties details of the information that would be available to\nshort-listed bidders.\nFour bidders were then invited to submit contract proposals and were given 10 months in\nwhich to develop these. The minimum conditions that the RTA specified were only:\n\u2022 Insurance requirements.\n\u2022 Provisions for safety and security access to the network.\n\u2022 Statutory reporting requirements.\nAll of the bids were reviewed by a panel from RTA which was supported by a consultant\nfrom an international management consulting firm. The bids were reviewed on the basis of:\n\u2022 Commercial benefits for the RTA and government\n\u2022 The level of asset and environmental protection provided.", "Appendix 2, page 46\n\u2022 The incident management system.\n\u2022 The technical advantages of the system proposed.\n\u2022 The extent of resource transfer from the RTA to the contractor. Prior to the\ncommencement the process, staff and unions had been informed of the RTA\u2019s\nproposal, and it had been agreed that the contract would contain clauses dealing with\nthe transfer of appropriate staff and their conditions of employment under the new\ncontractor.\n\u2022 The technical and financial capability of the contractor.\nTransfield-Maintenance was selected as the preferred bidder and negotiated with the\ngovernment over seven months to arrive at a contract, which will be in place for 10 years.\nThe Conditions of the Contract are key to its structure as is the notion of \u201cFitness for Purpose\u201d.\nWithin the conditions of contract is the technical specification of maintenance standards required.\nThere are 51 asset classes, each defined and standards are set for:\n\u2022 The maintenance rationale.\n\u2022 The inspection plan.\n\u2022 The level of service required \u2014 which includes the limits of the contractors responsibility,\na quality management system, contract management and reporting and procedures\nfor change.\n\u2022 The intervention standards \u2014 which are a safety net to the fitness for purpose standard\nand specify response times depending on defect severity.\n\u2022 Any local variations.\nSince developing these standards for the performance contract RTA, have come to use\nthem as guidelines for all of its operation.\nThe contractor is awarded a base monthly fee for the contract (amounting to A$102 million\nover 10 years). This is paid on the base inventory of assets. Several commercial schedules were\nalso developed to allow for payment and penalties to be levied. These involve:\n\u2022 Rates for inventory adjustment.\n\u2022 Pavement model activity rates \u2014 the contract assumes maximum growth factors for\ntraffic and these are reviewed annually.\n\u2022 Traffic signal upgrade rates.\n\u2022 Lane occupancy fees.\n\u2022 Response time non-conformance deductions.\n\u2022 Management non-conformance deductions.\n\u2022 Cost adjustments.", "Appendix 2, page 47\n\u2022 An inventory adjustment threshold schedule \u2014 if new assets are added to the inventory\nit is the contracts duty to maintain them fit for purpose without payment, until\nthe yearly inventory review when the base payments will be adjusted to allow for\nthe addition.\n\u2022 Review schedules.\nThe contract defines routine and major maintenance work for all of the asset types \u2014\nmaking determinations on the basis of cost effectiveness. Work which is less likely to be required,\nbut is high in cost, tended not to be included in the routine maintenance work \u2014 in order to ensure\nthat the costs of the Transfield contract were not pushed up unreasonably.\nAs well as the basic maintenance services, Transfield is obliged to provide the following\nprovisional services:\n\u2022 Restoration of excavation work by others.\n\u2022 Repair of damage to the road from over dimensioned vehicles operating under\nlicense.\n\u2022 Damage from motor vehicle accidents.\n\u2022 Vandalism, other than graffiti.\n\u2022 Force majeure damage \u2014 defined as events with a lower than one in ten year probability\nof occurrence.\n\u2022 Repetitive traffic signal errors.\nSince these events are not in the control of either party, Transfield is obliged to provide the\nservices and then to invoice RTA directly. Additional services which become necessary during the\ncourse of the contract, but which neither side had foreseen, may be undertaken by Transfield if they\nare less than A$60,000 in value. Where the works will cost between A$60,000 and A$300,000 then\nRTA may ask Transfield to undertake the work, may call for bids or use RTA staff directly. Over\nA$300,000 RTA must either call for bids or use RTA staff.\nThere is a fully developed Quality Assurance regime including plans for:\n\u2022 Quality.\n\u2022 Contract management.\n\u2022 Environmental management.\n\u2022 Incident response.\n\u2022 Community relations.\n\u2022 Asset management.\n\u2022 Occupational, health, safety and rehabilitation.\nFitness for purpose is measured against level of service provided on each asset. This is\nmeasured against such indicators as average roughness per link (for pavement) and condition\nindices for bridges. In order to measure these, Transfield is required to collect various data for the\nRTA on the asset inventory and condition, traffic volumes, truck weights and maintenance amounts\nand locations.", "Appendix 2, page 48\nRTA and Transfield have entered into a \u201cpartnering\u201d arrangement. Both sides seek to address\nissues at the lowest possible managerial level and to address them swiftly. RTA has one manager\nof the contract (spending approximately 50 percent of his time) and one full time supervisor.\n2. New Zealand\nThe New Zealand Government has privatized many of the managerial functions under its\nauspices. This has been a strategic decision to develop the private sector within the country and to\nreduce public sector involvement and has covered all sectors, including transport. Hence there is\nnow only a very small staff within the Ministry of Transport. The ministry relies on two larger bodies\nto manage its work \u2014 Transit (which plans, maintains and manages the network) and Transfund\n(which controls the funds).\nThere are 90,000 km of roads in New Zealand, in which the Government makes an annual\ninvestment of NZ$0.4 billion per year. Transit manages the state highway network of 10,300 kms.\nApproximately half of its expenditure goes towards construction and emergency works, 16 percent\nto preventive maintenance and 35 percent to routine maintenance.\na. Maintenance Management Contracts\nTransit undertakes little of the construction or maintenance work in-house. There are instead,\n24 professional management contracts, with a maximum contract period of 3 years. These\nmanagement contractors oversee the physical work done by the maintenance contractors (for\nwhich there are 220 contracts). The maintenance contractors are typically paid on unit rates for the\ncompletion of work and the managers through a lump sum payment on completion of the service.\nThe savings from this contracting-out saved Transit around 17 percent of the total cost. However,\nthe system was perceived to have some disadvantages:\n\u2022 The short contracts meant that maintenance work was undertaken to last for three\nyears \u2014 no consideration was given to life costs.\n\u2022 Several contractors did not perform to time and budget which meant expensive litigation.\n\u2022 There has been an adversarial relationship between government, management\ncontractors and maintenance suppliers.\nAs a result, Transit has begun a trial program of performance-specified maintenance\ncontracts combining the physical works and the professional management services. The payment\nfor these contracts is on output specifications with the contractors determining how the work is\nundertaken. Lump-sum payments are made at the end of 10 years, if the required condition has\nbeen delivered. Contractors are required to develop their own quality management systems to\ndemonstrate that they are complying with the contract. It is hoped that the trial will:\n\u2022 Remove administrative costs in servicing the periodic contracts.\n\u2022 Encourage physical contractors and the managers to work as a team.\n\u2022 Force the contractor to consider a longer horizon and thereby produce higher quality\nwork.", "Appendix 2, page 49\n\u2022 Promote innovation.\nThe trial is to be staged, over two networks (representing approximately 10 percent of the\nNew Zealand road network and NZ$9 million per year). The first tender is due to be let in December\n1998, through a competitive bidding procedure, in which there will be a quality/price trade off.\nConforming bids must be submitted but bidders may also submit alternatives.\nThere has been some concern from the existing local contractors that international\ncontractors will be attracted and that the small contractors may lose out because of the size of the\ncontracts. There is also some concern that the contractors will not be able to perform the self-\nmonitoring role.\nb. BOT Projects\nThere are no BOT road projects in New Zealand. Two potential BOT projects are Second\nHarbour Crossing and South Eastern Arterial Route Scheme in Auckland.\nHowever a BOT project would require legal changes to allow the private sector to charge\nand collect tolls.\nc. Corporatization\nCurrently New Zealand is considering corporatization of their road network, following a report\nfrom the \u201cRoading Advisory Group\u201d published in November 1997. The Roading Advisory Group\nsaw the concerns with the existing road system management as:\n\u2022 The lack of a direct relationship between road pricing and use \u2014 pricing is currently\nthrough a fuel tax (9.5c of which goes directly into a road fund the rest to the exchequer),\nvehicle registration charges, and road user charges levied on larger vehicles according\nto weight and usage.\n\u2022 The lack of a direct relationship between road providers and users.\n\u2022 The lack of commercial incentives to invest in road infrastructure.\nHowever the Government objective that the highways must remain in public ownership has\nbeen taken into account and hence the recommended corporatization of the road network by\ntransferring the assets held by Transit and the local authorities into the hands of road companies\nwhich \u201cshould be financially viable\u201d. The road companies would own corridors or defined networks,\nfor which they would be fully responsible \u2014 in terms of maintenance, safety, environmental\nmanagement, user relations, and pricing. Each user would be required to pay the actual cost of\ntheir use of the road system, and the road companies would be fully responsible for price setting\nand would charge directly for road use at the local level.\nJ. South Africa\nThere are 7,000 km of road in the South African national road network, and some 660 km of\nthat are presently tolled, at 18 toll plazas. BOT projects have not been the normal \u201cmodus operandi\u201d\nuntil the last few years \u2014 instead most roads were operated for the Government under management\ncontracts (with fixed terms of between 3 and 5 years).", "Appendix 2, page 50\nHowever, the current policy is for all new toll road projects to be undertaken under the BOT\nmechanism and to be fully privately funded over 30 years.\n1. N4 Motorway\nThe N4 project is a cross border, concessioned toll road, from Maputo in Mozambique to\nWitbank in South Africa, and is the first BOT road for either country. There is an existing road for\n390 km, which will be upgraded substantially and a further 50 km must be built. The existing traffic\non the road is fairly low, but expected to increase with the upgrading. There will be no parallel free\nroad \u2014 in most places, although there has been some political backlash, particularly in middle\nclass towns in South Africa, where protests have forced local politicians to offer improved facilities\non the adjacent roads.\nHaving called for bids in 1995, and short-listed three consortia in 1996, the concession\nagreement was signed in May 1997 with the TRAC consortium which includes the Bouygues\ngroup and two local contractors. Both countries signed the 30-year concession agreement,\nwhich added legal complexity because of their different national legislation. With Bouygues\u2019\nencouragement, the Hungarian M5 concession model, was used as the basis of the N4\nagreement. This means that some of the complexities of the Hungarian model (some of which\nwere necessary only because of the specifics of Hungarian legal practices) have been\nduplicated.\nThe TRAC consortium has agreed a fixed price, fixed time design and construction contract\nwith SSB, a joint venture of Bouygues, Basil Read and Stock Roads (all part of TRAC). Construction\nhas been phased over 3.5 years and began in January 1998.\nFinancial closure was reached within seven months of signing the concession agreement.\nDebt of US$308 million has been raised. US$68 million of equity will be drawn down over the life of\nthe project to maintain a 80:20 debt/equity ratio. Up to 40 percent of the equity is held by the sponsors.\nDevelopment Bank of South Africa was one of the chief arrangers of the financing. Some of the\nupside potential has been shared with the two governments.\nThere are 5 toll plazas along the road, three in RSA and two in Mozambique but none at\nthe border. The RSA plazas are expected to open within 18 months of the start of the contract but\nthe others not until the end of the construction period. The location of each plaza has caused\npolitical concern. In Mozambique one toll plaza is located to capture commuting traffic into Maputo.\nIn South Africa, as already mentioned, there has been some political intervention by the mining\ncommunities of Witbank and Middleburg, just outside Pretoria, which resulted in the upgrading of\nthe parallel \u201cfree\u201d road.\nThere are level of service criteria in the concession agreement, and future expansions\nare envisaged if traffic grows. TRAC has certain pre-emptive rights over services alongside the\nroad.\nThe N4 is one of several initiatives being undertaken in the corridor, including an upgrade\nof the rail link from the border to the port. The development of the corridor is being promoted by\nboth countries through the Maputo Corridor Company, and supported by the South African\nDevelopment Bank.", "Appendix 2, page 51\n2. Other Concessions under Development\nTwo other road BOT projects are currently under development in South Africa:\n\u2022 The N3 Heidelberg - Cedara (part of the road between Johannesburg and Durban). 110\nkm of new road is required and 60 km of upgrading from a single to a dual carriageway.\nBids have been submitted.\n\u2022 The N4 West Platinum Toll Road from Pretoria to the RSNBotswana border which will\nbe 380 km long. The shortlist has been prepared and the preferred tenderer is to be\nselected in November 1998. The road is the last link in the East-West international\nhighway linking Walvis Bay in Namibia with Maputo in Mozambique.\n3. Operators\nThe South African firm, Intertoll, has become a major international toll road operator, having\nstarted in RSA in 1 984 to undertake management contracts for the DOT. In 1992, the company\nstarted to diversify and took on its first concession project in Hungary in 1993 (the M5). It has since\nentered into joint venture agreements", "Appendix 3, page 1\nBOT PROJECT DATABASE SUMMARY\nPROJECT STATUS\nCountry Open Construction Planning Pre-Planning Abandoned Total\nBangladesh 1
