The prime example is Mexico's\nsale of dollar-linked bonds (called tesobonos) prior to the 1994 peso\ncrisis.\n\nAsset Price Inflation\n\nEconomies that have experienced large increases in asset\nprices\u2014especially real estate and equity prices\u2014may be particularly\nvulnerable. In part, that is because investors may feel those prices\nhave further to fall. Large increases in real estate prices may be an\nindication  that  investments  to  date  have  not  been  allocated\nproductively.\n\nWHY WAS THE ASIAN FLU WORSE THAN\nTHE TEQUILA EFFECT?\n\nThe question has been raised why the fallout from the Mexican\ncrisis was milder than the Asian crisis. In fact, trade and financial\nchannels spread contagion during the Mexican peso crisis, just as\nthey did in the Asian crisis two years later. Spreads on Latin dollar-\ndenominated bonds over US Treasuries (the most widely used\nindicator of country risk) shot up the end of 1994 to 1,500 basis\npoints or more, implying almost certain default. Argentina, Brazil,\nand other countries in the region drastically tightened monetary\npolicy, and Argentina, as noted above, fell into a severe but brief re-\ncession. Nevertheless the extent of the crisis was relatively limited.\nSome partial explanations follow.\n\nImpact of Debt Servicing Shortfall Reduced by\nUS Support for Mexico\n\nMexico\u2019s proximity to the United States and the Clinton\nadministration's commitment to NAFTA made the United States\neffectively a lender of last resort to Mexico. That reduced potential\nliquidity problems in the region. Creditors\u2019 worries about the like-\nlihood of repayment on Mexican debts were assuaged, allowing\nspreads on Mexican and other Latin bonds to compress fairly\nrapidly. Despite the IMF\u2019s commitment to Indonesia, Korea, and\nThailand it appears East Asia lacks a similar lender of last resort.\n\n\f8\n\ncentral bank intervention (see \u201cCurrency Crises\u201d above). If macro-\neconomic fundamentals deteriorate and the central bank's reserves\nfall, the chances of a forced depreciation increase. That raises the\nexpected gains to a short sale, which makes the exchange rate a\nprofitable target for traders. But with a floating rate any deteriora-\ntion in fundamentals is priced into daily currency movements,\nreducing the possible gains to traders of attacking the currency.\n\nCurrent Account Deficit\n\nThe higher the current account deficit, the more capital the\ngovernment or private firms must borrow or obtain through foreign\ninvestment to cover import payments. A sudden increase in the\ncurrent account deficit, as occurred in Korea in 1996, is therefore a\nsign of vulnerability. One rule of thumb is to regard a current\naccount deficit over 5% of GDP as a danger sign, but that number\nis arbitrary. Whether a given current account deficit is in the danger\nzone also depends on the share of investment goods in imports, the\ncauses of the deficit, and other factors. A high or increasing external\ndebt stock (resulting from past deficits) also indicates vulnerability,\nsince a higher debt entails higher required interest payments.\n\nBudget Deficit\n\nA government budget deficit represents national dissavings.\nSince the current account deficit is equal to the difference between\nnational savings and investment, an increase in the budget deficit\n\u2014particularly in a fixed exchange rate regime\u2014usually prompts a\ndeterioration in the current account. Danger levels for the budget\ndeficit vary considerably, depending in part on the government\u2019s\nreputation and the stage of the business cycle.\n\nFinancial Sector Credit to the Private Sector\n\nThe higher the level of bank credit to the private sector (for\nexample, above 100% of GDP), the larger the ratio of bad loans to\nGDP if interest rates rise sharply. High levels of domestic bank lend-\ning therefore act as a constraint on the central bank's ability to raise\ninterest rates in the event of an attack on the currency, since the\ngovernment may be unwilling to provoke large-scale defaults. This\nwas one of Thailand\u2019s problems in responding to attacks on the baht\n(see Figure 2).\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Asian financial crisis has spread from Thailand to other\n\nEast Asian countries and even to Russia and Latin America,\ndespite major differences among the affected countries. Con-\ntagion is the general term for this tendency of financial upheavals\nto move rapidly across borders. This is not the first time contagion\nhas cropped up\u2014Latin America suffered from a bout following the\nMexican peso devaluation of 1994-1995, and international financial\npanics have occurred sporadically over the past 100 years.\n\nEconomists do not have a fully satisfactory account of con-\ntagion, but there is some agreement on the channels of transmission\nand sources of vulnerability. This paper presents current views on\ncontagion and attempts to identify patterns in recent episodes. It\nbegins by analyzing the mechanics of an attack on the currency\u2014\nthe central event in a contemporary emerging market financial\ncrisis. It describes current thinking about the channels of contagion\nand the conditions that make countries vulnerable to the affliction.\nFinally, the note compares Asia in 1997 with Latin America in\n1994-1995.\n\nIn an economy with a fixed exchange rate, an increasing\ncurrent account deficit or a large expiring debt load is likely to cause\na drop in foreign reserves. If investors believe foreign reserves are\ntoo low for the central bank to maintain the exchange rate, they may\nsell local currency assets for dollars to be safe, or even borrow local\ncurrency in hopes of paying it back later at a cheaper rate\u2014an\noperation known as selling short. If the central bank runs out of\nreserves it must let the currency float. When this happens the\ncurrency usually falls much further than fundamentals seem to\nwarrant. The shock from the currency slide may subject other coun-\ntries to a strong blast of contagion.\n\nTrade links are the most direct channel of contagion. When one\ncountry devalues its currency in response to an attack, there is a\nnegative impact on the current account balances of its trading\npartners, making them in turn more vulnerable. Financial markets\nare also major avenues for contagion. Panic sales of assets in an\n\n\f2\n\n7\n\nafflicted country lead investors to take money out of erstwhile\nhealthy markets to cover their losses. And a financial panic in one\ncountry may change some investors\u2019 beliefs about the financial\nhealth of a country with apparently similar characteristics, causing\nother investors to withdraw capital for fear of a run on the central\nbank.\n\nContagion associated with the Asian financial crisis of 1997-\n1998 has been more virulent than the Tequila effect of the 1994-1995\nMexican peso crisis. In part, that is because the United States had\na powerful incentive to cover expiring Mexican obligations, mak-\ning the US Treasury effectively a lender of last resort for Mexico. The\nmuch lower levels of financial leverage in Latin economies com-\npared with Asia also acted as a shock absorber during Tequila,\nallowing central banks to raise interest rates to foil speculators with-\nout shutting off domestic credit. In many cases\u2014most notably in\nArgentina\u2014Latin governments responded to attacks more decisively\nthan their Asian counterparts, giving confidence to the markets.\n\nThe central event in the Mexican peso crisis of 1994-1995, and\nagain in the Thai crisis of 1997, was a rapid depreciation from a fixed\nexchange rate. To understand contagion, it is useful to know the\nmain dynamics of currency crises.\n\nTo maintain a specific exchange rate, a government (in most\ncases, the central bank) must stand willing to buy or sell its own cur-\nrency in exchange for gold or foreign currency at the fixed rate. That\nmeans the government must maintain a stock of foreign reserves\u2014\nusually US dollars. If reserves are exhausted because too much of\nthe domestic currency is presented for redemption to the central\nbank, the government loses its ability to set the exchange rate. The\nrate then floats, generally depreciating rapidly, and often sliding\npast the level where it would have traded if it had never been fixed\ninitially.\n\nThe evolution of the reserve stock is determined by two basic\nquantities: the current account and the capital account. If the\ncurrent account (essentially equal to exports minus imports minus\n\nBut why should events in Mexico make investors apprehen-\nsive about Argentina? Conceivably, investors treated the Mexican\ncrisis as new information about countries that seemed similar to\nMexico, and lowered their estimates of the chance of repayment on\nArgentine debt. As a result, even investors who did not change their\nviews about Argentina itself may have been perfectly rational to sell\nArgentine assets. It could make sense for one investor to sell if he\nthought other investors would sell, since a large enough wave of sel-\nling would force the Argentine Central Bank to abandon its defense\nof the currency, which would reduce the dollar value of his assets.\nCurrent explanations of contagion often focus on cases where\nmarkets may stabilize at one of two or more possible levels. In such\nsituations, the rational choice may be to follow the market, instead\nof doing what seems warranted by macroeconomic fundamentals.\nArgentina appeared fairly strong in 1995, as did Korea in 1997. But\nan investor who held on to Argentine or Korean assets through the\nensuing crises probably lived to regret it.\n\nContagion presupposes vulnerability in countries that catch\nthe disease. Some countries are never attacked. In some cases, such\nas in Argentina; Mexico; and Taipei,China after the onset of the\nAsian crisis, investors begin selling assets, then realize that the\nchances of devaluation are low and reverse course. Or the central\nbank can stage an unexpectedly strong response to attack, as in\nBrazil last November. Of course, as implied above, if investor\nsentiment is strongly negative, even countries that seem only\nslightly vulnerable\u2014for example, Korea last year\u2014may be over-\nwhelmed by capital outflows. The following are major indicators of\nvulnerability.\n\nExchange Rate Regime\n\nA fixed rate or tightly managed float generally leaves a coun-\ntry more vulnerable to attack than a free float. For traders, that is\nbecause a currency peg creates the possibility of a misalignment\nbetween the pegged rate and the rate that would prevail without\n\nCURRENCY CRISES AND SPECULATIVE ATTACKS\n\nSIGNS OF VULNERABILITY\n\n\f6\n\n3\n\nKorea) came under attack, Korean investors liquidated holdings of\nLatin American Eurobonds in order to cover their dollar obligations.\nAs prices on Brazilian and Argentine dollar-denominated bonds fell,\nBrazilian banks that had purchased the bonds on borrowed funds\nwere forced to sell Brazilian local currency denominated assets for\ndollars, reducing the Brazilian Central Bank\u2019s stock of foreign re-\nserves and making Brazil a target for attack. These episodes show\nhow a sudden drop in liquidity brought about by falling prices for\none kind of asset may induce a fire sale of other assets, even with\nno change in fundamentals.\n\nFinancial Volatility\n\nVolatility is another possible source of financial contagion.\nIMF economist Pierre-Richard Agenor (1997) has developed a\nmodel of contagion in which an increase in financial volatility\u2014of\nthe kind that accompanies a crisis anywhere\u2014leads to an increase\nin lending rates worldwide. That happens because rising volatility\nreduces the payments lenders receive in the worst states of the\nworld, but does not raise returns when things go well. Lenders raise\ninterest rates to compensate for the resulting drop in expected\nreturn, which reduces the total amount of capital supplied world-\nwide. As capital sources dry up, borrower countries are harder\npressed to roll over their debts, which increases uncertainty.\n\nBandwagon Effects\n\nReflecting the experience of the Asian and peso crises, econo-\nmists have developed models of self-fulfilling expectations that\nexplain the seemingly irrational behavior observed in currency\ncrises. Much of that behavior does not appear to be fully explained\nby direct trade or financial channels. One simple story is that even\ninvestors without liquidity problems become less willing to lend\nafter a currency collapse. For example, after the sudden deprecia-\ntion  of  the  Mexican  peso,  still-sound  foreign  banks  became\ndisinclined to lend to Argentina. Investors who already held Argen-\ntine assets worried about being repaid and pulled money out of the\ncountry. To prevent the sudden depreciation of the currency, the\ngovernment raised short-term interest rates from 10% to 35%,\nthereby prompting a year-long recession.\n\ninterest payments on the country\u2019s foreign debt) is in surplus,\nreserves will increase, all else being equal. But the capital account,\nwhich consists primarily of financial flows, also affects reserves.\nInflows of foreign investment, or foreign purchases of equities, in-\ncrease reserves. Also debt inflows\u2014in the form of foreign currency\nborrowed by private corporations or by the government\u2014will\nincrease the reserve stock. The problem is that many capital in-\nflows\u2014sales  of  equity,  domestic  debt  instruments,  or  dollar-\ndenominated short-term debt\u2014can reverse quickly.\n\nFixed exchange rate regimes get into trouble when reserves\nstart to fall\u2014most often because of a large current account deficit,\na drop in foreign investment, or lenders\u2019 reduced willingness to roll\nover the country\u2019s debts. If investors think the reserve decline will\ncontinue, they may decide to sell their assets now to redeem them\nfor dollars at the fixed rate, before the currency depreciates. That\naccelerates reserve loss. Other traders may see a chance to profit\nfrom a depreciation by borrowing the local currency and changing\nthe proceeds into dollars now, in the hope of repaying their newly\nacquired local currency debts cheaply when the exchange rate drops\n(known as taking a short position, or shorting the currency).\n\nSales of domestic currency in the expectation of a deprecia-\ntion\u2014or even in order to provoke one\u2014constitute a speculative\nattack. Thailand was the target of a series of speculative attacks\nbefore it finally let the baht float in July 1997. Brazil experienced a\nsevere speculative attack in October 1997, but maintained its peg\nby adopting textbook defensive measures. To shore up the capital\naccount, it doubled domestic interest rates. That raised the return\nfor investors keeping their money in domestic currency and made\nit more expensive to borrow funds to short the currency. The inter-\nest rate increase also reduced import demand by slowing down the\neconomy. In addition, the government introduced an emergency\ndeficit reduction package. That was intended to reduce Brazil\u2019s\ndemand for overseas savings, thereby contracting the current\naccount deficit.\n\nAlthough it is possible for contagion to spread in the absence\nof a nominal depreciation, the more severe episodes of contagion\nin emerging markets typically involve fear of depreciation, as was\nthe case in Brazil.\n\n\fFigure 1:  Asian Trade as a Percentage of Total Trade, 1996\n\nEXPORTS TO ASIA\n(percent of total exports)\n\nIMPORTS FROM ASIA\n(percent of total imports)\n\n4\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\ng , C h i n\np .\nR\n\no\n\ne\n\nn\n\nK o\n\na\n\nf\n\nK o\n\na\ne\nr\nS i n\n\np\n\na\n\ng\n\ne\nd\n\nr\n\nn\n\no\n\nI\n\ne\n\nn\n\no\n\ns i a\nM a l a\n\ny\n\ns i a\nh i l i p\n\nP\n\np i n\n\ns\nh\n\ne\n\nT\n\ng , C h i n\np .\nR\n\no\n\ne\n\nn\n\nK o\n\nd\n\ng\n\nn\n\nn\n\na i l a\nH o\n\ng\n\nn\n\nH o\n\na\n\nf\n\nK o\n\na\ne\nr\nS i n\n\na\n\ng\n\ne\nd\n\np\n\no\n\nr\n\nn\n\nI\n\ne\n\nn\n\no\n\ns i a\nM a l a\n\ns i a\nh i l i p\n\ny\n\nP\n\np i n\n\ns\nh\n\ne\n\nT\n\nd\n\nn\n\na i l a\n\nJapan\nOther Asia\n\nSource: IMF,\n\nDirection of Trade Statistics\n\n(1998)\n\n.\n\nCHANNELS OF CONTAGION\n\nDistinguishing among the channels of contagion can be haz-\nardous. In an emerging market selloff many channels seem to be\nworking at once, particularly when new information hits the mar-\nket. Nevertheless it is useful to identify the different ways by which\ncontagion can spread. It is also worth recognizing that sometimes\nwhat appears to be contagion is just separate markets reacting to a\ncommon external shock\u2014for example, to the 1994 rise in US inter-\nest rates, or to the oil price increases of the 1970s.\n\nTrade Links\n\nTrade links provide a natural channel for financial contagion.\nConsider the Thai devaluation. Last year\u2019s fall in the baht made Thai\nexports cheaper to foreign buyers. For countries such as Indonesia\nthat compete in export markets with Thailand, that means foreign\ndemand for exports falls as importers in the US and Japan switch\nto the now-cheaper Thai goods. Lower exports imply an increase in\n\n5\n\nIndonesia\u2019s current account deficit\u2014a financing gap that Indonesia\nmust make up by borrowing more overseas. If foreign investors are\nunwilling to expand Indonesia\u2019s implicit line of credit, Indonesia\nmust cover the financing gap out of its foreign reserves. But a\nreduction in reserves leaves Indonesia with fewer dollars to defend\nthe rupiah, which reduces confidence in the currency and makes\nIndonesia an easier target for currency traders betting on a rupiah\ndevaluation.\n\nThe baht\u2019s devaluation also raises the cost of imports in\nThailand, which reduces Thai imports from (for example) Laos. That\nraises the Lao current account deficit and puts pressure on the Lao\ncurrency. Also, because the Thai devaluation was accompanied by\na Thai recession, Thai import demand fell by even more than the\ndevaluation alone would suggest, reinforcing the contagion effect.\nOf course, even though Thai exports did not rise immediately\nafter the baht devaluation, Indonesia was quickly affected. From the\nperspective of financial markets, it is not actually necessary for Thai\nexports to rise. It is sufficient for investors to expect that they will\nrise, which will cause prices for Indonesia\u2019s exports to fall,  increas-\ning Indonesia\u2019s trade deficit. Investors who expect the Indonesian\ncurrency to depreciate rapidly in the future will sell rupiah that they\nhold, or even sell rupiah short (see \u201cCurrency Crises\u201d above for an\naccount of selling short), right now. Those sales can precipitate a\nsudden devaluation right away.\n\nFinancial Channels\n\nLiquidity Effects\n\nEven when trade links to the crisis country are insignificant,\ncontagion may spread through financial channels. That occurred in\nOctober 1997 when US investors in emerging market mutual funds\nsold their shares in response to falling markets in Asia. Fund man-\nagers in turn sold appreciated Latin American stocks to meet\nredemption orders rather than selling depreciated Asian shares. In\nLatin America's relatively thin markets, the impact of such actions\nby foreign asset managers can be dramatic.\n\nGlobal investors within crisis countries also spread bear\nmarkets.

That was intended to reduce Brazil\u2019s\ndemand for overseas savings, thereby contracting the current\naccount deficit.\n\nAlthough it is possible for contagion to spread in the absence\nof a nominal depreciation, the more severe episodes of contagion\nin emerging markets typically involve fear of depreciation, as was\nthe case in Brazil.\n\n\f2\n\n7\n\nafflicted country lead investors to take money out of erstwhile\nhealthy markets to cover their losses. And a financial panic in one\ncountry may change some investors\u2019 beliefs about the financial\nhealth of a country with apparently similar characteristics, causing\nother investors to withdraw capital for fear of a run on the central\nbank.\n\nContagion associated with the Asian financial crisis of 1997-\n1998 has been more virulent than the Tequila effect of the 1994-1995\nMexican peso crisis. In part, that is because the United States had\na powerful incentive to cover expiring Mexican obligations, mak-\ning the US Treasury effectively a lender of last resort for Mexico. The\nmuch lower levels of financial leverage in Latin economies com-\npared with Asia also acted as a shock absorber during Tequila,\nallowing central banks to raise interest rates to foil speculators with-\nout shutting off domestic credit. In many cases\u2014most notably in\nArgentina\u2014Latin governments responded to attacks more decisively\nthan their Asian counterparts, giving confidence to the markets.\n\nThe central event in the Mexican peso crisis of 1994-1995, and\nagain in the Thai crisis of 1997, was a rapid depreciation from a fixed\nexchange rate. To understand contagion, it is useful to know the\nmain dynamics of currency crises.\n\nTo maintain a specific exchange rate, a government (in most\ncases, the central bank) must stand willing to buy or sell its own cur-\nrency in exchange for gold or foreign currency at the fixed rate. That\nmeans the government must maintain a stock of foreign reserves\u2014\nusually US dollars. If reserves are exhausted because too much of\nthe domestic currency is presented for redemption to the central\nbank, the government loses its ability to set the exchange rate. The\nrate then floats, generally depreciating rapidly, and often sliding\npast the level where it would have traded if it had never been fixed\ninitially.\n\nThe evolution of the reserve stock is determined by two basic\nquantities: the current account and the capital account. If the\ncurrent account (essentially equal to exports minus imports minus\n\nBut why should events in Mexico make investors apprehen-\nsive about Argentina? Conceivably, investors treated the Mexican\ncrisis as new information about countries that seemed similar to\nMexico, and lowered their estimates of the chance of repayment on\nArgentine debt. As a result, even investors who did not change their\nviews about Argentina itself may have been perfectly rational to sell\nArgentine assets. It could make sense for one investor to sell if he\nthought other investors would sell, since a large enough wave of sel-\nling would force the Argentine Central Bank to abandon its defense\nof the currency, which would reduce the dollar value of his assets.\nCurrent explanations of contagion often focus on cases where\nmarkets may stabilize at one of two or more possible levels. In such\nsituations, the rational choice may be to follow the market, instead\nof doing what seems warranted by macroeconomic fundamentals.\nArgentina appeared fairly strong in 1995, as did Korea in 1997. But\nan investor who held on to Argentine or Korean assets through the\nensuing crises probably lived to regret it.\n\nContagion presupposes vulnerability in countries that catch\nthe disease. Some countries are never attacked. In some cases, such\nas in Argentina; Mexico; and Taipei,China after the onset of the\nAsian crisis, investors begin selling assets, then realize that the\nchances of devaluation are low and reverse course. Or the central\nbank can stage an unexpectedly strong response to attack, as in\nBrazil last November. Of course, as implied above, if investor\nsentiment is strongly negative, even countries that seem only\nslightly vulnerable\u2014for example, Korea last year\u2014may be over-\nwhelmed by capital outflows. The following are major indicators of\nvulnerability.\n\nExchange Rate Regime\n\nA fixed rate or tightly managed float generally leaves a coun-\ntry more vulnerable to attack than a free float. For traders, that is\nbecause a currency peg creates the possibility of a misalignment\nbetween the pegged rate and the rate that would prevail without\n\nCURRENCY CRISES AND SPECULATIVE ATTACKS\n\nSIGNS OF VULNERABILITY\n\n\f8\n\ncentral bank intervention (see \u201cCurrency Crises\u201d above). If macro-\neconomic fundamentals deteriorate and the central bank's reserves\nfall, the chances of a forced depreciation increase. That raises the\nexpected gains to a short sale, which makes the exchange rate a\nprofitable target for traders. But with a floating rate any deteriora-\ntion in fundamentals is priced into daily currency movements,\nreducing the possible gains to traders of attacking the currency.\n\nCurrent Account Deficit\n\nThe higher the current account deficit, the more capital the\ngovernment or private firms must borrow or obtain through foreign\ninvestment to cover import payments. A sudden increase in the\ncurrent account deficit, as occurred in Korea in 1996, is therefore a\nsign of vulnerability. One rule of thumb is to regard a current\naccount deficit over 5% of GDP as a danger sign, but that number\nis arbitrary. Whether a given current account deficit is in the danger\nzone also depends on the share of investment goods in imports, the\ncauses of the deficit, and other factors. A high or increasing external\ndebt stock (resulting from past deficits) also indicates vulnerability,\nsince a higher debt entails higher required interest payments.\n\nBudget Deficit\n\nA government budget deficit represents national dissavings.\nSince the current account deficit is equal to the difference between\nnational savings and investment, an increase in the budget deficit\n\u2014particularly in a fixed exchange rate regime\u2014usually prompts a\ndeterioration in the current account. Danger levels for the budget\ndeficit vary considerably, depending in part on the government\u2019s\nreputation and the stage of the business cycle.\n\nFinancial Sector Credit to the Private Sector\n\nThe higher the level of bank credit to the private sector (for\nexample, above 100% of GDP), the larger the ratio of bad loans to\nGDP if interest rates rise sharply. High levels of domestic bank lend-\ning therefore act as a constraint on the central bank's ability to raise\ninterest rates in the event of an attack on the currency, since the\ngovernment may be unwilling to provoke large-scale defaults. This\nwas one of Thailand\u2019s problems in responding to attacks on the baht\n(see Figure 2).\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Asian financial crisis has spread from Thailand to other\n\nEast Asian countries and even to Russia and Latin America,\ndespite major differences among the affected countries. Con-\ntagion is the general term for this tendency of financial upheavals\nto move rapidly across borders. This is not the first time contagion\nhas cropped up\u2014Latin America suffered from a bout following the\nMexican peso devaluation of 1994-1995, and international financial\npanics have occurred sporadically over the past 100 years.\n\nEconomists do not have a fully satisfactory account of con-\ntagion, but there is some agreement on the channels of transmission\nand sources of vulnerability. This paper presents current views on\ncontagion and attempts to identify patterns in recent episodes. It\nbegins by analyzing the mechanics of an attack on the currency\u2014\nthe central event in a contemporary emerging market financial\ncrisis. It describes current thinking about the channels of contagion\nand the conditions that make countries vulnerable to the affliction.\nFinally, the note compares Asia in 1997 with Latin America in\n1994-1995.\n\nIn an economy with a fixed exchange rate, an increasing\ncurrent account deficit or a large expiring debt load is likely to cause\na drop in foreign reserves. If investors believe foreign reserves are\ntoo low for the central bank to maintain the exchange rate, they may\nsell local currency assets for dollars to be safe, or even borrow local\ncurrency in hopes of paying it back later at a cheaper rate\u2014an\noperation known as selling short. If the central bank runs out of\nreserves it must let the currency float. When this happens the\ncurrency usually falls much further than fundamentals seem to\nwarrant. The shock from the currency slide may subject other coun-\ntries to a strong blast of contagion.\n\nTrade links are the most direct channel of contagion. When one\ncountry devalues its currency in response to an attack, there is a\nnegative impact on the current account balances of its trading\npartners, making them in turn more vulnerable. Financial markets\nare also major avenues for contagion. Panic sales of assets in an\n\n\fFigure 2:  Net Domestic Credit to Private Sector, 1996\n(percent of GDP)\n\n9\n\n180\n\n160\n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\ng , C h i n\np .\nR\n\ne\n\nn\n\nK o\n\ng\n\nn\n\nH o\n\na\n\no\n\nf\n\nK o\n\nr\n\na\ne\nS i n\n\np\n\na\n\ng\n\ne\n\nr\n\nn\n\no\n\nI\n\ne\n\nn\n\no\n\nd\n\ns i a\nM a l a\n\ns i a\nh i l i p\n\ny\n\nP\n\np i n\n\ns\n\ne\n\nT\n\nh\n\na i l a\n\nd\nn\nA r\n\ne\n\ng\n\na\n\nt i n\n\nn\n\na\n\nB r\n\no\n\na\n\nx i c\nt i n\n\nn\n\nz i l\n\nA r\n\nM e\ne\ng\n\n9\na\n\n(\n\n9\n1\nB r\n\n)\n4\nz i l\n\n)\no\n\n9\n\n4\n9\nx i c\n\n1\n(\nM e\n\n)\n\n4\n\n9\n\n9\n\n1\n\n(\n\nSource: IMF,\n\nInternational Financial Statistics\n\n(1998).\n\nShort-term Debt\n\nEven when a country is close to current account balance, as\nKorea was in 1997, high levels of short-term debt (usually defined\nas debt maturing within a year), create vulnerability, since lenders\nmay suddenly decide to stop rolling over loans. A short-term debt\nstock in excess of reserves is a danger sign.\n\nForward Sales\n\nCentral banks may sell dollar contracts in forward or futures\nmarkets in order to bolster the domestic currency. These trades often\nhave the effect of reducing the level of reserves available to resist\nan attack, or raising the stakes if an attack occurs. Indonesia, Korea,\nand Thailand all fell into this trap.\n\nExchange Guarantees\n\nCentral banks may also undertake a variety of market opera-\ntions, such as sales of domestic bonds with an exchange rate\nguarantee, that have the effect of limiting the government\u2019s freedom\n\n\fContents\n\nINTRODUCTION .................................................................................... 1\n\nCURRENCY CRISES AND SPECULATIVE ATTACKS .......................... 2\n\nCHANNELS OF CONTAGION ............................................................... 4\nTrade Links ................................................................................... 4\nFinancial Channels ...................................................................... 5\n\nSIGNS OF VULNERABILITY .................................................................. 7\n\nWHY WAS THE ASIAN FLU WORSE THAN\nTHE TEQUILA EFFECT? ...................................................................... 10\n\nREFERENCES ....................................................................................... 12\n\nFigures\n1\n\nAsian  Trade as a Percentage of  Total  Trade, 1996 ..................... 4\n\n2 Net Domestic Credit to Private Sector, 1996 ............................... 9\n\n10\n\nto respond in the event of an attack. The prime example is Mexico's\nsale of dollar-linked bonds (called tesobonos) prior to the 1994 peso\ncrisis.\n\nAsset Price Inflation\n\nEconomies that have experienced large increases in asset\nprices\u2014especially real estate and equity prices\u2014may be particularly\nvulnerable. In part, that is because investors may feel those prices\nhave further to fall. Large increases in real estate prices may be an\nindication  that  investments  to  date  have  not  been  allocated\nproductively.\n\nWHY WAS THE ASIAN FLU WORSE THAN\nTHE TEQUILA EFFECT?\n\nThe question has been raised why the fallout from the Mexican\ncrisis was milder than the Asian crisis. In fact, trade and financial\nchannels spread contagion during the Mexican peso crisis, just as\nthey did in the Asian crisis two years later. Spreads on Latin dollar-\ndenominated bonds over US Treasuries (the most widely used\nindicator of country risk) shot up the end of 1994 to 1,500 basis\npoints or more, implying almost certain default. Argentina, Brazil,\nand other countries in the region drastically tightened monetary\npolicy, and Argentina, as noted above, fell into a severe but brief re-\ncession. Nevertheless the extent of the crisis was relatively limited.\nSome partial explanations follow.\n\nImpact of Debt Servicing Shortfall Reduced by\nUS Support for Mexico\n\nMexico\u2019s proximity to the United States and the Clinton\nadministration's commitment to NAFTA made the United States\neffectively a lender of last resort to Mexico. That reduced potential\nliquidity problems in the region. Creditors\u2019 worries about the like-\nlihood of repayment on Mexican debts were assuaged, allowing\nspreads on Mexican and other Latin bonds to compress fairly\nrapidly. Despite the IMF\u2019s commitment to Indonesia, Korea, and\nThailand it appears East Asia lacks a similar lender of last resort.\n\n\f11\n\nHealthy Financial System\u2014Low Ratio of Domestic Credit\nto GDP in Latin America\n\nDomestic credit to the private sector was about 20% of GDP in\nArgentina, 40% of GDP in Mexico, and 50% in Brazil, at the time of\nthe  Tequila  crisis.  That  ratio  was  about  100%  for  Malaysia,\nSingapore, and Thailand, and 60% for Korea, when the Asian crisis\nhit (see Figure 2). Central banks in Latin America therefore had\nroom to raise interest rates without precipitating a wave of defaults.\n\nMarket Credibility Enhanced by Decisive Action\n\nArgentina made it clear from the beginning of the Tequila\ncrisis that it would contract monetary policy as far as necessary to\ndefend the dollar peg, whatever the cost in unemployment. Mexico\ntightened monetary policy, floated the peso, and moved quickly to\ntake over the bad foreign currency debts of its private firms. By con-\ntrast some Asian countries tried to defer the pain of reform.\n\nCapital Controls\n\nArgentina imposes virtually no capital controls, but Chile re-\nstricts short-term capital inflows, while Brazil imposes several\ndifferent restrictions on inflows and outflows. In 1995, and again in\n1997, anecdotal evidence suggests that Brazilian and Chilean con-\ntrols may have slowed down speculative flows.\n\n\f12\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAgenor, P.R., 1997.
