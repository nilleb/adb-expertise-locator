In June 2009, the Committee on Payment and Settlement \nSystems (CPSS) therefore commissioned the Working Group on Repo Market Infrastructure \nto  investigate  the  extent  to  which  the  clearing  and  settlement  infrastructure  for  repos \ncontributed to the instability evident in some repo markets. The Working Group was also \nasked to identify potential ways in which the repo clearing and settlement infrastructure could \nbe improved.  \nThis  report  first  presents  a  comprehensive  survey  of  the  clearing  and  settlement \narrangements for repos in selected CPSS member countries. In particular, it sheds light on \nthe experience with these arrangements during the financial crisis. The analysis shows that \nrepo clearing and settlement arrangements vary considerably across countries and markets.  \nSecond, the report identifies several issues related to clearing and settlement arrangements \nfor repos that have the potential to affect the resilience of repo markets (eg the risks related \nto  the  extension  of  significant  amounts  of  intraday  credits  within  some  repo  settlement \narrangements; the lack of transparency of some repo infrastructure roles, responsibilities, \npractices and procedures; concerns regarding the protection against counterparty credit risk \nin repo transactions; and inadequate capabilities for liquidating repo collateral in the event of \na cash borrower\u2019s default). Due to the substantial variety in repo clearing and settlement \narrangements, the identified issues are not relevant to the same extent in each market. \nFinally,  the  report  outlines  options  and  measures  through  which  these  issues  can  be \naddressed.  \nThe report concludes that it is worthwhile for the stakeholders in each market to review how \nthe clearing and settlement arrangements for repos could be further strengthened. As a first \nstep, the report suggests that the providers of such arrangements in each country should, \njointly  with  market  participants,  regulators  and  the  central  bank,  attempt  to  develop  a \ncommon view on the relevance of the identified issues for their market. As a second step, \neach provider could then evaluate which measure or combination of measures would be best \nsuited to address the relevant issues in its specific circumstances. \nThe CPSS is very grateful to the members of the Working Group and its chairman, Andy \nSturm (Swiss National Bank), for their excellent work in preparing this report.  \nWilliam C Dudley, Chairman \nCommittee on Payment and Settlement Systems \n \n \nCPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010  iii\n ", "", " \nContents \nExecutive summary..................................................................................................................1 \n1.

As part of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s (FSB) \nbroader  work  stream  \u201cStrengthening  the  core  financial  infrastructures  and  markets\u201d,  the \nCommittee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) therefore commissioned a working \ngroup  to  investigate  the  extent  to  which  the  market  infrastructure  \u2013  ie  the  practices, \nprocedures and systems used for clearing and settling repos and liquidating a defaulting \ncash borrower\u2019s collateral \u2013 added to the uncertainty in repo markets and whether there is \nroom for improvement.  \nBased on a comprehensive survey of the clearing and settlement arrangements for repos in \nselected CPSS countries and, in particular, on the experience with these arrangements \nduring the financial crisis, the Working Group identified seven issues related to the repo \nmarket infrastructure that have the potential to affect the resilience of repo markets: (1) the \nrisks related to the extension of significant amounts of intraday credits within some repo \nsettlement arrangements; (2) the lack of transparency of some repo infrastructure roles, \nresponsibilities,  practices  and  procedures;  (3)  concerns  regarding  protection  against \ncounterparty credit risk in repo transactions; (4) inadequate capabilities for liquidating repo \ncollateral in the event of a cash borrower\u2019s default; (5) the inefficient use of (high-quality) \ncollateral due to constraints within repo clearing and settlement arrangements; (6) procyclical \neffects of certain risk management practices; and (7) a lack of transparency in the repo \nmarket. The Working Group believes that appropriate measures on the level of repo clearing \nand settlement infrastructure can play a role in helping to address these issues, thereby \ncontributing to more resilient repo markets. The seven issues and potential measures to \naddress these issues are briefly summarised below.  \nFirst, the settlement procedures for repo transactions, and in particular for term repos, can \ngive rise to the extension of significant amounts of intraday credit to the cash borrower, either \nby repo settlement infrastructures or by settlement banks supporting the repo infrastructure. \nThis may create vulnerabilities not only for the institution extending intraday credit, but also \nfor the repo counterparties. For instance, the cash borrower may become dependent on risk \nmanagement decisions by the institution extending intraday credit, while the cash lender \u2013 to \nthe extent that it holds temporarily a cash deposit with the settlement institution instead of \nsecurities  collateral  \u2013  may  face  heightened  counterparty  risk.  Where  relevant,  an \ninfrastructure settling repo transactions thus might review its practices and procedures to \nensure  that  the  arrangements  allow  for  effective  mitigation  of  the  risks  related  to  the \nextension of significant amounts of intraday credit. \nSecond, to the extent that repo clearing and settlement infrastructure roles, responsibilities, \npractices and procedures are not fully transparent, market participants may misperceive the \ncredit and liquidity risks involved by entering into repo transactions. Moreover, particularly in \ntimes  of  market  stress,  uncertainty  about  the  repo  infrastructure  roles,  responsibilities, \npractices  and  procedures  can  give  rise  to  concerns  in  using  the  infrastructure.  Where \nrelevant, repo clearing and settlement infrastructure facilities are thus encouraged to raise \nmarket participants\u2019 awareness of their roles, responsibilities, practices and procedures and \nto eliminate any related ambiguities. \nThird, concerns regarding protection against counterparty credit risk in repo transactions can \nsuddenly deter financial institutions from participating in repo markets, particularly in times of \nvolatile collateral prices and heightened counterparty credit risk. Depending on the adequacy \nof their risk management, central counterparties (CCPs) can play an important role in helping \nfinancial institutions manage their counterparty risk in repo markets. Stakeholders in the repo \nmarket thus might evaluate carefully the benefits and limitations of introducing or promoting \nthe wider use of a CCP for the repo market. In addition, other repo infrastructure facilities \ncould evaluate whether and how they can assist participants in managing counterparty risk \nmore effectively. \n \nCPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010  1\n ", " \nFourth,  in  the  event  of  a  cash  borrower\u2019s  default,  cash  lenders  must  be  entitled  and \noperationally able to take possession of and liquidate the repo collateral. If cash lenders are \nnot well prepared to do so they might withdraw from the market in times of heightened \ncounterparty  risk  concerns.  In  markets  cleared  by  a  CCP,  the  CCP  takes  over  the \nresponsibility of liquidating collateral in the event of a cash borrower\u2019s default. In other \nmarkets, tri-party repo service providers could evaluate whether and how they can play a role \nin  supporting  their  participants\u2019  preparations  for  collateral  liquidation.  Even  if  market \nparticipants are adequately prepared for liquidating collateral, they might still withdraw from \nthe market if they fear that the liquidation of a substantial amount of collateral following the \ndefault of a large market participant creates the potential for fire sale conditions. While this \nreport presents some suggestions as to how market infrastructure could help reduce the \npotential for fire sale conditions, it is acknowledged that this is essentially a collective action \nproblem that requires coordinated action by market participants. \nFifth,  constraints  on  the  efficient  and  flexible  use  of  collateral  within  repo  clearing  and \nsettlement  arrangements  can  complicate  market  participants\u2019  collateral  management, \nhampering  the  development  of  liquid  repo  markets  in  normal  times  and  affecting  the \nresilience of repo markets in times of stress. The efficient and flexible use of collateral could \nbe fostered by repo collateral substitution and re-use functionalities or, in the case that \nfrictions  are  caused  by  fragmented  infrastructure,  by  establishing  efficient  and  secure \nlinkages between clearing and settlement infrastructure that facilitate the transfer of collateral \nbetween different markets and countries.  \nSixth, risk management practices that aggravate procyclical effects in repo markets can be \ndetrimental to the resilience of repo markets in times of stress. To the extent that repo market \ninfrastructures must manage their own credit and liquidity risks, they could consider adopting \nrisk  management  practices  that  mitigate  procyclical  effects  (eg  by  calibrating  margins, \nhaircuts and liquidation horizons to stressed market scenarios). This is particularly relevant \nfor CCPs, but to some extent also for any other repo infrastructure that bears credit and \nliquidity risks. \nSeventh, inadequate transparency as well as asymmetric information in repo markets can \nexacerbate  the  full  or  partial  withdrawal  of  some  repo  market  participants  in  times  of \nheightened credit and liquidity risks. To enhance the transparency of repo markets, repo \ninfrastructures are encouraged to consider reasonable requests \u2013 by market participants or \nauthorities \u2013 to make available meaningful summary statistics on the repo market. \nFinally,  it  needs  to  be  stressed  that  repo  clearing  and  settlement  arrangements  vary \nconsiderably across countries and markets, and hence not all of the identified issues are \nrelevant to the same extent in each market. Nevertheless, the Working Group believes that it \nis  worthwhile  for  the  stakeholders  in  each  market  to  review  how  the  repo  market \ninfrastructure could be further strengthened. As a first step, the providers of repo market \ninfrastructures in each country, jointly with market participants, regulators and the central \nbank, should attempt to develop a common view on the relevance of the identified issues for \ntheir market. Based on that, each repo market infrastructure could then evaluate which \nmeasure or combination of measures would be best suited to address the relevant issues in \nits specific circumstances.  \n2  CPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010\n  ", " \n1.  Introduction \nIn general, repo markets are seen by market participants as a safer and more reliable source \nof funding than uncollateralised money markets. During the recent financial crisis, however, \nrepo markets proved to be a less reliable source of funding liquidity than expected in some \ncountries.  The  Committee  on  Payment  and  Settlement  Systems  (CPSS)  sought  to \ninvestigate the extent to which the market infrastructure \u2013 ie the practices, procedures and \nsystems used for clearing and settling repos and liquidating a defaulting cash borrower\u2019s \ncollateral  \u2013  added  to  the  uncertainty  in  repo  markets  and  whether  there  is  room  for \nimprovement. For this purpose, the CPSS set up a working group (see Annex 4 for a list of \nthe  Working  Group  members).  The  Working  Group\u2019s  efforts  form  part  of  the  Financial \nStability Board\u2019s (FSB) broader work stream \u201cStrengthening the core financial infrastructures \nand markets\u201d, which considers improvements to market infrastructures and measures to \nreduce the risk of contagion. \nThe Working Group was mandated (i) to take stock of the existing arrangements for clearing \nand settling repos in the CPSS countries, including measures taken by market participants \nand/or central banks during the crisis to restore the functioning of repo markets; (ii) to identify \nand analyse the strengths and weaknesses of various clearing and settlement arrangements \ncurrently  in  place;  and  (iii)  to  identify  options  for  strengthening  the  repo  clearing  and \nsettlement arrangements with a view to enhance the resilience of repo markets.  \nReflecting the diversity of the repo clearing and settlement arrangements across markets, the \nWorking Group adopted a functional approach and analysed all repo clearing and settlement \nservices,  irrespective  of  whether  these  services  are  provided  by  dedicated  market \ninfrastructures or commercial banks.  \nThe Working Group focused its work on the clearing and settlement of cash-driven repos. \nThe performance of repo markets within the broader financial system and policies on the \navailability of services from central banks to repo counterparties and to financial market \ninfrastructures were outside the scope of the Working Group.  \nRelated work \nA number of previous CPSS reports have analysed the clearing and settlement of repo \ntransactions. In July 1999, the CPSS together with IOSCO published the report Securities \nlending transactions: market development and implications, which covered certain aspects of \nrepo transactions. The 1999 report describes the market structure, size, participants and the \nlegal framework. It also analyses types of risks and risk management practices. In November \n2001 and November 2004, respectively, the CPSS and IOSCO published Recommendations \nfor securities settlement systems and Recommendations for central counterparties. Although \nthese  recommendations  are  often  applied  to  clearing  and  settlement  infrastructures  for \nrepos, they do not focus on the infrastructure\u2019s role for repo transactions per se. These \nrecommendations are currently being reviewed by CPSS and IOSCO. \nThe Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) has also published several reports \nthat have examined certain aspects of repos. In March 1999, the CGFS published the report \non the Implications of repo markets for central banks, which proposes market practices to \nsupport the development of sound and efficient repo markets. Recently, a CGFS report \npublished in March 2010 on The role of margin requirements and haircuts in procyclicality \nsets out six policy options, including some for consideration, which, if implemented, may help \ncounter or reduce the procyclicality in secured lending and OTC derivatives markets. While \nnot directly focusing on clearing and settlement infrastructures, the outlined policy options \nare also relevant for repo markets and their clearing and settlement arrangements. \nIn addition, initiatives have been undertaken by the private sector to enhance the resilience \nand  efficiency  of  repo  markets.  In  the  United  States,  a  Task  Force  on  Tri-Party  Repo \nInfrastructure was formed under the auspices of the Payments Risk Committee (PRC) to \n \nCPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010  3\n ", " \ndevelop a set of recommendations for mitigating risks related to tri-party repo transactions. \nAmong others, the final report released in May 2010 includes specific recommendations for \nthe  repo  clearing  and  settlement  arrangements  in  the  United  States.  In  Europe,  the \nInternational Capital Markets Association (ICMA) European Repo Council released in July \n2010 a white paper on the operation of the European repo market, which discusses, among \nothers, existing barriers to the efficient transfer of collateral cross-border and key features of \nefficiently interconnected clearing and settlement infrastructures. Another European forum \nbringing together market participants, infrastructure providers and the public sector is the \nContact group on euro securities infrastructures (COGESI), chaired by the ECB. It addresses \npost-trade  issues  in  euro  financial  markets,  including  collateral  management  and \ninteroperability between clearing and settlement infrastructures. \nPurpose and structure of this report \nThe purpose of this report is to identify options for strengthening the repo clearing and \nsettlement  arrangements  with  a  view  to  enhancing  the  resilience  of  repo  markets.  The \nprimary audience of this report thus comprises providers of repo clearing and settlement \nservices,  irrespective  of  whether  they  are  dedicated  market  infrastructure  providers  or \ncommercial banks. In addition, this report should be of interest to a broader audience, \nincluding repo market participants, regulators, and central banks.  \nThe report is structured as follows. Chapter 2 provides an overview of repo clearing and \nsettlement arrangements, covering the major repo markets in USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, CAD, \nCHF, SEK and HKD.1 Chapter 3 evaluates the impact of the financial crisis on repo markets \nand compares the experience of different countries, and important features of repo clearing \nand settlement arrangements to identify issues that have the potential to affect the resilience \nof repo markets. Chapter 4 explores the issues identified in more detail and discusses \nvarious  ways  in  which  repo  infrastructure  providers  might  address  these  issues.  The \nconcluding Chapter 5 suggests that the relevant stakeholders in each repo market review \nhow repo market infrastructure could be further strengthened.  \n                                                 \n1  Countries and repo market currencies are not necessarily identical as in some countries repos are also \nentered  in  non-domestic  currencies.  Moreover,  the  tri-party  repo  service  providers  offer  multi-currency \ncollateral management services. \n4  CPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010\n  ", " \n2.  Overview of repo clearing and settlement arrangements \nFocusing on the clearing and settlement arrangements for cash-driven repos, this chapter \ndescribes  the  life  cycle  of  a  repo  transaction  and  reviews  the  clearing  and  settlement \narrangements in selected CPSS countries.  \nLife cycle of a repo transaction and the role of market infrastructure \nA repo transaction (short for repurchase agreement) is an agreement between two parties on \nthe sale and subsequent repurchase of securities at an agreed price. In economic terms a \nrepo transaction is equivalent to a loan secured by securities (collateral). In cash-driven \nrepos, cash borrowers \u2013 usually banks and securities dealers \u2013 employ repo transactions to \nrefinance their trading portfolios or to finance short- and mid-term cash needs, essentially as \nan alternative or complement to other financing sources such as unsecured loans and the \nissuance  of  short-term  securities.  Cash  lenders  are  typically  looking  for  a  short-term \ninvestment opportunity for surplus cash incurring minimal counterparty and market risk. Cash \nlenders not only include banks, but in some repo markets also investment funds, asset \nmanagement firms and \u2013 in a few cases \u2013 insurance companies.2  \nRepos can be distinguished according to the involvement of intermediaries between the cash \nlender and the cash borrower. In bilateral repos the cash lender and the cash borrower select \nthe collateral, initiate the transfer of cash and securities and conduct collateral valuation. In \ntri-party repos, however, a third party (tri-party repo service provider) enters into a tripartite \nagreement with the two counterparties to the transaction. The tri-party repo service provider \nis  responsible  for  the  administration  of  the  transaction,  in  particular  the  selection  and \nvaluation of collateral securities.3 Both types of repos can be combined with CCP clearing. \nA repo transaction goes through several processing steps from the point at which two parties \nagree to execute a repo transaction to the point where the transaction is completed with the \nsettlement of the repurchase leg. This life cycle is different from a regular buy-sell securities \ntransaction in three important respects: the management of collateral during the life of the \nrepo transaction, the existence of \u2013 in general \u2013 two settlement processes (ie one for the \npurchase leg and one for the repurchase leg), and the potential need to liquidate collateral in \nthe event of the cash borrower\u2019s default. Figure 1 illustrates the key steps in the repo life \ncycle,  which  are  briefly  described  below.  A  more  detailed  description  can  be  found  in \nAnnex 1 of this report. \nDocumentation: In most countries, the contractual basis for entering into repos consists of \ndomestic  and/or  international  master  agreements  between  the  cash  lender  and  cash \nborrower.  These  contracts  are  complemented  by  clearing  and  settlement  agreements \nbetween trading parties and key infrastructures, such as central counterparties and tri-party \nrepo service providers. \nTrade execution: Repo transactions are typically agreed bilaterally between cash lenders \nand  borrowers,  through  electronic  trading  systems,  phone  or  e-mail.  Some  inter-dealer \ntrades are executed through inter-dealer brokers via electronic broker screens or phone. The \n                                                 \n2   Closely related to cash-driven repos are so-called special repos, where the primary focus is on lending or \nborrowing specific securities rather than cash. In special repos, the cash plays the role of collateral, and the \ninterest rate charged, which depends on the \u201cspecialness\u201d of the security, is in general lower than in cash-\ndriven repos. The clearing and settlement arrangements for special repos are often similar to cash-driven repo \ntransactions. \n3   Another type of repos is hold-in-custody repos. They are characterised by the cash borrower retaining control \nof the securities and by serving simultaneously throughout the transaction not only as principal but also as the \ncash lender\u2019s custodial agent. The focus of this report is on bilateral and tri-party repos. \n \nCPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010  5\n ", " \nexecution of repo transactions is less standardised and less often electronic compared to \nbuy-sell securities transactions.  \nConfirmation/matching: Affirmation of the economic terms (also known as verifications) and \nconfirmations are done over phone, fax, e-mail or on electronic platforms. Responsibility for \nentering the settlement instructions into the relevant settlement systems depends on the \ncountry and the trading venue. If trades are executed bilaterally over phone or e-mail, each \ntrading party is usually responsible for entering instructions to the settlement system where \nthey are matched. If trades are executed on an automated trading platform, responsibility can \nlie with the trading platform, which sends pre-matched instructions, or with the counterparties \n(similar to trading over the phone or e-mail). \nNovation/open offer and central counterparty (CCP) clearing: Once a repo transaction \nhas been confirmed and matched, a CCP may become the lender to the cash borrower and \nthe borrower to the cash lender. This can be achieved through novation or open offer.4 As in \nother financial markets, CCP clearing is an optional feature in repo markets. The benefits \nand limitations of CCPs in repo markets are discussed in Box 1 below. \nFigure 1 \nLife cycle of a repo transaction \n  \n \nSettlement of purchase leg: On the value date, the purchase leg is settled in the same \npayment  and  securities  settlement  systems  used  for  buy-sell  transactions,  sometimes \ncomplemented by specific repo modules, eg for the automated selection of collateral.  \n                                                 \n4   In the case of novation, the agreement between the cash lender and cash borrower is replaced by two \nagreements, one between the cash lender and the CCP, the other between the cash borrower and the CCP. \nIn the case of open offer, after the cash lender\u2019s and the cash borrower\u2019s offers are matched, the CCP \nautomatically  and  immediately  becomes  interposed  in  that  transaction,  thus  creating  two  separate \nagreements. At no stage does a direct agreement between the cash lender and the cash borrower exist. \n6  CPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010\n  ", " \nCollateral management and risk management: After the settlement of the purchase leg, \nvalues  must  be  assigned  to  collateral  (by  using  trade  data  to  conduct  mark-to-market \nvaluations of the collateral and to apply appropriate margins and haircuts5) and margin calls \nmust be triggered if the collateral value falls below the loan value. These functions may be \nperformed by the cash lender, a tri-party repo service provider on behalf of the cash lender, \nor by a CCP, depending on the type of repo. Collateral substitution allows the cash borrower \nto substitute collateral during the lifetime of a term repo in order to obtain the return of \nspecific collateral. Collateral re-use allows the cash lender to use the received collateral for \nalternative purposes during the lifetime of the repo.  \nSettlement of repurchase leg: Upon termination of the repo, securities collateral is returned \nto the cash borrower and cash, including interest, is returned to the cash lender. For the \nsettlement of the repurchase leg, counterparties rely on the same payment and securities \nsettlement systems as for the purchase leg.  \nCollateral liquidation (in case of default): If the cash borrower defaults, the cash lender \n(including, where available, repo CCPs) will need to assume control over the collateral and \nliquidate it to cover its losses or refinance the collateral to obtain liquidity. The ability of the \ncash lender to assume control of and liquidate a potentially large collateral portfolio in a \ntimely manner depends critically on clear and enforceable legal documentation6 and its own \noperational capabilities. \n \nBox 1 \nBenefits and limitations of CCPs in repo markets \nWhen it comes to the benefits they yield and the limitations they face, CCPs for repo markets are \ncomparable  with  those  in  other  financial  markets.  From  the  perspective  of  individual  repo \ncounterparties, the benefits of a CCP in terms of risk management and efficiency will depend \n\u2013 among other factors \u2013 on its risk management framework including the financial resources \navailable in case of participant default, on the standardisation of repo contracts, and on the ability to \nreduce open exposures from repos through legally effective netting between a CCP and each \nmember generating multilateral netting benefits. Netting efficiency depends on market structure, \nand the number of participants and trading patterns. In addition, from a broader financial stability \nperspective, CCPs act as a firewall against the propagation of default shocks across major market \nparticipants, and they can mitigate procyclicality, enhance market transparency, facilitate collateral \nliquidation,  and  foster  standardisation  of  repo  terms  and  eligible  collateral.  For  example,  as \ndiscussed  in  the  recent  CGFS  report  on  The  role  of  margin  requirements  and  haircuts  in \nprocyclicality,  CCPs  could  impose  minimum  constant  through-the-cycle  margins  and  haircuts, \npreventing sudden and large one-off collateral calls that may severely affect the liquidity of an \ninstitution. A CCP might also be better equipped to administer the liquidation of a large portfolio \ncompared to uncoordinated liquidation by individual counterparties. In case of a default, the CCP\u2019s \nstandardised procedures would contribute to an orderly closeout of repos and collateral liquidation, \nhence mitigating contagion risk and spillover effects. In some markets, CCPs are also under \nevaluation  as  a  possible  instrument  for  providing  anonymity,  and  hence  for  preventing \nstigmatisation effects in times of stress.  \n                                                 \n5   Haircuts are expressed as a discount on collateral value, while margins are expressed as a mark-up on \nexposures. \n6   Enforceability will depend not only on contract law in the relevant jurisdictions, but also on the bankruptcy or \ninsolvency law applicable to the cash borrower in the relevant jurisdictions. The ability of the insolvency \nauthority to impose stays on collateral liquidation or impose losses on secured lenders is an important \nconsideration. This report does not analyse these issues. \n \nCPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010  7\n ", " \n \nBox 1 (cont) \nCCPs in repo markets face limitations that are comparable to those applying to CCPs in other \nfinancial markets, although some of these limitations might be particularly relevant for repo markets. \nFirst,  CCPs  concentrate  counterparty  risk  and  hence  their  failure  could  have  system-wide \nconsequences. It is therefore essential that CCPs are adequately regulated and comply with \nminimum  requirements  as  outlined  in  the  CPSS-IOSCO  Recommendations  for  central \ncounterparties. Second, a CCP\u2019s usefulness depends on the degree of standardisation of repo \nterms, which are often agreed bilaterally. Third, if repo market participants are typically on one side \nof the market, a CCP may not be able to significantly net down volumes and values. In this case, \nopen positions in a repo CCP can be very large and could create substantial additional collateral \nrequirements. Fourth, the capacity of a CCP to administer a participant\u2019s default depends critically \non its operational capabilities and its ability to rapidly obtain liquidity to meet its assumed settlement \nobligations and to close out repos and liquidate collateral in an orderly manner. Given the often very \nlarge size of open positions by major repo market participants, the collateral amounts to be \nliquidated may be very high. Fifth, in some markets cash borrowers and lenders may include a \nvariety of non-bank financial institutions and institutional investors. On the one hand, if these \ninstitutions have direct access, the CCP will face challenges with regard to risk monitoring and loss \nallocation. On the other hand, if direct access is not permitted, these institutions will have to rely on \ndirect participants to access the CCP. Finally, given the role of the repo market as a key funding \nsource for financial institutions, the suspension or exclusion of a participant by a CCP could \nseverely affect the participant\u2019s funding ability. Hence, the exclusion of a major participant, even if it \nis  in  line  with  the  CCP\u2019s  rules  and  regulations,  could  conflict  with  broader  financial  stability \nobjectives. \n \nRepo clearing and settlement arrangements in selected CPSS countries \nA cross-country comparison of clearing and settlement arrangements for repo transactions in \nselected CPSS countries reveals a few similarities and a number of differences, both minor \nand  fundamental.  The  most  important  similarities  and  differences  are  outlined  below. \nAnnex 2  of  this  report  contains  a  comprehensive  cross-country  comparison  of  repo \ninfrastructure arrangements. \nIn the countries analysed, clearing and settlement arrangements for repos are typically either \nintegrated in the clearing and settlement of buy-sell securities transactions, or provided \nthrough  special  repo  modules  or  segments  of  established  buy-sell  infrastructures  (eg \ncollateral management services, and reporting and notification on relevant custody events). \nNo stand-alone, dedicated arrangements for clearing and settling repo transactions were \nidentified. However, repo transactions often make up a significant share of the transaction \nvalues in those buy-sell infrastructures that handle repo transactions.  \nWhile  repos  in  all  countries  thus  clear  and  settle  to  a  very  large  extent  on  the  same \ninfrastructure as regular buy-sell transactions, there are only a small number of additional \nsimilarities. First, all markets analysed have in common that repos settle in DVP mode, \neliminating principal risk in the settlement of the purchase and repurchase legs of a repo \ntransaction. Settlement in all markets is also facilitated by securities lending and borrowing \nservices  to  minimise  settlement  fails.  Another  similarity  is  that  in  the  event  of  a  cash \nborrower\u2019s default, none of the markets have a dedicated collateral liquidation facility that \ncould  support  or  coordinate  the  liquidation  of  collateral  across  multiple  counterparties. \nHowever, in markets cleared by a CCP, one could argue that the CCP de facto assumes the \nrole of a dedicated collateral liquidation facility.  \nThe repo clearing and settlement arrangements in the CPSS countries analysed exhibit an \narray  of  differences,  reflecting  to  some  extent  the  differences  present  in  the  buy-sell \ninfrastructure in these countries. Some of the key functional differences include: \n8  CPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010\n  ", " \n\uf0b7  Clearing: In the majority of the CPSS countries analysed, a CCP is available for \nclearing repos, but the scope and the share of CCP clearing varies considerably. In \nsome countries they form an essential part of the repo infrastructure and are widely \nused, in other countries they are established but rarely used. Yet, in other countries \nrepo CCPs are currently being introduced or evaluated. Where they are established, \nrepo CCPs are part of a CCP that also clears other market segments, including buy-\nsell securities transactions.  \n\uf0b7  Settlement: Settlement arrangements vary along several dimensions. First, in some \nCPSS countries, repo transactions are settled in central bank money, while in other \ncountries  they  are  settled  in  commercial  bank  money.  Second,  the  role  and \nsignificance of intraday credit to expedite repo settlement varies considerably. Third, \nin some markets the settlement window for repos is separate and often shorter than \nthe  settlement  window  for  buy-sell  transactions,  while  in  other  markets  the \nsettlement of repo and buy-sell transactions overlap. Finally, while in all markets \nsecurities lending and borrowing services place limits on settlement fails, in some \nmarkets they are complemented by penalties and further incentives to settle on time.  \n\uf0b7  Collateral management: The management of repo collateral during the life of the \nrepo transaction varies along three key dimensions \u2013 the collateral manager, the \nmechanism used for collateral substitution, and the ability of the cash lender to re-\nuse  collateral.  First,  collateral  is  managed  directly  by  the  cash  lender  (or  its \ncustodian bank) or by a third-party agent (eg a tri-party repo service provider or a tri-\nparty  collateral  management  service  provider).  The  relevance  of  tri-party  repo \nservice providers to repo transactions varies significantly. While in some countries \nalmost all repos are managed by a tri-party repo service provider (eg United States, \nSwitzerland), such services do not exist at all in other countries (eg Sweden), or are \nof relatively low importance (eg in the euro area about 10% of repos are tri-party). \nSecond, where available, substitution of collateral by the cash borrower during the \nterm of the repo is achieved in different ways. In the United States and United \nKingdom,  term  repo  transactions  are  typically  unwound  daily  allowing  for  the \ndelivery of different securities at the end of the day when the (term) repo is re-\nsettled. In tri-party repos in Europe, on the other hand, the tri-party repo service \nproviders allow for continuous substitution of specific collateral over the life cycle of \nthe repo transaction. In some other countries substitution of collateral by the cash \nborrower is not allowed. Finally, the scope for the cash lender to re-use collateral \nalso varies. In some countries (eg Switzerland) full re-use is permitted, in other \ncases (eg the Euro GC Pooling segment of Eurex Repo) re-use is possible within \nthe system, while in the United States \u2013 for tri-party repos and GCF repos \u2013 re-use \nis not permitted, or not possible by design.  \n\uf0b7  Risk management: In almost all markets, margins and haircuts are applied to the \nmark-to-market collateral value to provide a cushion against market fluctuations in \ncollateral value. In some markets, they are specified bilaterally between the cash \nborrower and cash lender. In other cases, such as when trades are executed on \nelectronic trading platforms, there may be a standard haircut or margin by collateral \ntype applied to all repo transactions. In markets where a CCP is involved, the CCP \neffectively standardises the margins and haircuts as it becomes the counterparty to \nevery  cash  borrower  and  every  cash  lender.  In  contrast,  tri-party  repo  service \nproviders typically only implement the margins and haircuts agreed upon by the \ncounterparties. \n\uf0b7  Degree of automation: A few of the markets analysed achieve full straight through \nprocessing from the trade execution on electronic platforms to the termination of the \ntransaction by settling the repurchase leg. In other markets, one or several post-\ntrading steps of the repo life cycle require manual interventions.  \n \nCPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010  9\n ", " \nBesides  these  functional  differences,  the  clearing  and  settlement  arrangements  in  the \nanalysed  CPSS  countries  also  vary  according  to  institutional  features  such  as  the \norganisational structure, ownership and business model of repo infrastructure providers and \naccess to these infrastructures. For example, in some countries repo infrastructures are \norganised as dedicated infrastructures or special-purpose banks, while in other countries the \ninfrastructure for clearing and settling repos is part of a general purpose commercial bank. \nMoreover,  in  some  countries,  repo  market  counterparties  have  mainly  direct  access  to \nmarket infrastructures, while in other countries tiering plays a larger role.  \nAgainst  the  backdrop  of  these  cross-country  differences  in  terms  of  repo  clearing  and \nsettlement arrangements, the Working Group investigated to what extent specific features of \nthese  arrangements  might  enhance  or  compromise  the  resilience  of  the  repo  market, \nparticularly in times of stress. In the next chapter, this issue is analysed in the light of the \nexperience of the financial crisis. \n10  CPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010\n  ", " \n3.  Repo clearing and settlement arrangements in the light of the \nfinancial crisis \nThis chapter summarises the main developments in repo markets during the recent financial \ncrisis and identifies the features of repo clearing and settlement arrangements in selected \nCPSS  countries  that  might  have  affected  the  resilience  of  repo  markets.7  The  features \nidentified will be explored in more detail in Chapter 4. \nGeneral repo market developments \nThe performance of repo markets during the financial crisis has been analysed from various \nperspectives.8  These  studies  conclude  that  in  markets  around  the  world  the  terms  for \nsecured lending, which includes cash-driven repo transactions, became progressively tighter \nfor a range of asset types over the course of the crisis. With the exception of a few markets \nor market segments, the absolute volume of repos declined during the crisis.  \nThe first phase of the financial crisis was marked by a considerable loss in counterparty \nconfidence, which resulted in a shift from the unsecured to the secured money market. In all \nmarkets under consideration and for which relevant data is available it was observed that the \nrelative importance of the repo market as a source of short-term refinancing increased. This \ncorroborates the view that secured money markets tend to be a more reliable source of \nfunding liquidity relative to unsecured money markets. \nNevertheless, especially in the second phase of the financial crisis, after the collapse of \nLehman Brothers in September 2008, absolute outstanding values in the analysed repo \nmarkets declined.9 There were, however, a few exceptions, where outstanding repo values \nactually  increased.  For  example,  the  CCP-cleared  German  Eurex  repo  market,  and  in \nparticular its EURO GC (General Collateral) pooling segment, increased. Sterling and euro \nrepo volumes cleared by LCH.Clearnet Ltd also increased over the period, with volumes in \nOctober 2008 setting a record. Repo volumes cleared by FICC in the United States and \nLCH.Clearnet  SA  in  France  increased  as  well,  and  there  are  indications  that  in  other \nEuropean markets the reduction in outstanding repo values was less pronounced for CCP-\ncleared repos than for other repo segments.  \nThe general decline in outstanding repo values can be attributed to a number of factors. \nDoubts  about  the  creditworthiness  of  counterparties  as  well  as  legal  and  operational \nconcerns regarding the ability to liquidate collateral in case of counterparty default became \nmore pronounced. As a consequence, within most secured money markets cash lenders \n                                                 \n7   More detailed information on repo markets during the crisis is provided in Annex 3 of this report, which \noutlines country- and market-specific developments such as changes to (i) repo market volumes and values; \n(ii) eligible collateral used in repo markets; (iii) repo maturities; (iv) repo margins and haircuts; (v) repo \nsettlement fails; (vi) other notable changes or issues in repo markets during the crisis; and (vii) central bank \nactions taken with regard to the repo market. \n8   See, for example, CGFS Publications no 37, The functioning and resilience of cross-border funding markets, \nprepared by a joint Study Group of the CGFS and the Markets Committee, March 2010; and CGFS \nPublications no 36, The role of margin requirements and haircuts in procyclicality, March 2010.

Since December 2008, outstanding \nvalues have increased again to EUR 5,582 billion in December 2009 (ICMA European Repo Market Survey \nDecember 2009). The size of the US tri-party repo market declined from a peak of about USD 2.8 trillion in \nearly 2008 to USD 1.7 trillion during the first quarter 2010 (Federal Reserve Bank of New York: Tri-party repo \ninfrastructure reform, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, May 2010). \n \nCPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010  11\n ", " \ndemanded shorter repo maturities and higher quality collateral (eg government securities). At \ntimes, counterparty credit risk concerns reached levels where some market participants were \nunwilling to lend even against high-quality collateral. The decline in outstanding volumes also \nreflected  a  general  deleveraging  by  market  participants  and,  as  funding  uncertainty \nincreased, a widespread reluctance to lend cash. In several markets the decline in market \nactivity was amplified by an increase in haircuts and margins and by cuts in credit lines and \nconcentration limits. In addition, market participants\u2019 defensive behaviour triggered by the \nconcerns and uncertainties about credit and liquidity risks might have been aggravated by a \nlack of transparency in some repo markets. Finally, in many markets, generous liquidity \nprovision by central banks and low levels of interest rates also contributed to a decline in \nrepo values.  \nThe role of repo clearing and settlement arrangements \nNot all repo markets were affected to the same degree by the financial crisis, and a few \nmarket  segments  actually  experienced  volume  growth  or  a  shift  to  longer  transaction \nmaturities.  The  Working  Group  thus  compared  different  country  experiences  during  the \nfinancial crisis and important features of clearing and settlement arrangements to identify \nissues  that  have  the  potential  to  affect  the  resilience  of  repo  markets.  However,  the \ncomparison  is  complicated  by  two  factors.  First,  besides  the  particular  clearing  and \nsettlement arrangements, there are a number of other environmental factors that differed \nmarkedly in the analysed markets (eg the level of counterparty risk or the leverage of repo \nmarket  participants  at  the  beginning  of  the  financial  crisis).  It  is  thus  difficult  \u2013  if  not \nimpossible \u2013 to rigorously determine how far the differences in market resilience can be \nattributed to clearing and settlement arrangements. Second, even if one could control for the \nimpact of these environmental factors, clearing and settlement arrangements typically differ \nalong many dimensions, making it difficult to attribute differences in market resilience to \nindividual  features  of  clearing  and  settlement  arrangements.  These  difficulties \nnotwithstanding, the Working Group believes to have identified the following five clearing and \nsettlement related features that have played a role during the financial crisis. \nThe extension of significant amounts of intraday credit in some markets \u2013 either by the repo \ninfrastructure providers themselves or by settlement banks supporting the repo infrastructure \u2013 \ncreated  vulnerabilities  for  the  repo  infrastructure  and  repo  market  counterparties.  For \ninstance, the extension of intraday credit in the repo market in the United States is the direct \nresult of the clearing banks\u2019 practice of unwinding all maturing and non-maturing repos at the \nstart of the processing day (usually in the early morning), and not recreating (or rewinding) \nnon-maturing repos and settling new repos until near the close of the processing day, usually \nin the late afternoon. The practice of daily unwinds of non-maturing (term) repos can be due \nto market conventions, inadequate processing capabilities of infrastructures and/or for daily \nsubstitution  of  collateral.  The  issue  of  intraday  credit  extensions  is  further  explored  in \nSection 4.1 in the next chapter. \nThere are indications that in some countries not all stakeholders were fully aware of the risks \nthat market participants and repo infrastructure providers incurred. Insufficient transparency \nregarding  the  role(s)  and  responsibilities  of  repo  infrastructure  providers  can  lead  to \nmisperceptions of the credit and liquidity risk in repo transactions, including the risk involved \nin using the repo clearing and settlement arrangements. Insufficient transparency can also \ngive rise to a lack of confidence in using the infrastructure, particularly in times of market \nstress. Infrastructure providers which are part of an entity also engaging in commercial \nbanking or securities trading activities seem to be particularly prone to such situations, as \nparticipants might not be able to clearly distinguish between their various relationships with \nsuch entities. The issue of transparency about the roles and responsibilities of repo service \nproviders is further explored in Section 4.2. \nAs counterparty risk increased during the financial crisis, there is evidence that many cash \nlenders withdrew from the market, either in full or partially, since they considered that repo \n12  CPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010\n  ", " \ncollateral no longer provided effective protection against counterparty credit risk. However, \nas  discussed  above,  this  behaviour  was  generally  not  observed  in  markets  or  market \nsegments that were cleared by a repo CCP. To the extent that counterparty exposures and \ncounterparty risk are reduced by CCP clearing, a robust CCP can increase the resilience of \nrepo markets in times of stress, when counterparty risk concerns are high. The issue of \neffective protection against counterparty credit risk in repo transactions is further explored in \nSection 4.3. \nAt  least  in  some  markets,  a  complementary  factor  explaining  the  withdrawal  of  market \nparticipants from the repo market during the financial crisis is that not all cash lenders were \nadequately  prepared  to  take  control  of  and  liquidate  repo  collateral  in  the  event  of  a \ncounterparty  default.  Concerns  about  collateral  liquidation  thus  might  have  led  to  an \ninordinate decline in repo market activity when counterparty risk concerns were high. Again, \nin repo markets cleared by a CCP, this factor seems to have been less of a concern, as the \nCCP assumes de facto the role of a dedicated collateral liquidation facility, which liquidates \ncollateral in the event of a cash borrower\u2019s default.10 The issue of collateral liquidation is \nfurther explored in Section 4.4. \nEspecially  in  stressed  market  conditions,  when  there  is  a  flight  to  (scarce)  high-quality \ncollateral,  constraints  on  the  efficient  use  of  high-quality  collateral  in  repo  clearing  and \nsettlement  arrangements  can  affect  the  resilience  of  repo  markets.  Arrangements  that \ncontribute to the efficient use of collateral exist in several markets. For instance, in Germany \n(Euro GC pooling segment), collateral previously received in interbank repos can be re-used \nto  access  liquidity  from  the  central  bank.  Both  in  Germany  and  Switzerland,  collateral \neligibility criteria and valuation rules in the interbank repo market are aligned with central \nbank eligibility criteria, and operational procedures are closely integrated. Moreover, market \ninfrastructures with a network of linkages to securities markets (eg Clearstream Banking \nLuxembourg, Euroclear Bank, SIX SIS) allow for the centralisation and the flexible delivery of \nforeign collateral (eg in tri-party repo arrangements), which increases the amount of high-\nquality collateral available in these markets. For example, in Switzerland, the share of foreign \ncurrency  denominated  collateral  delivered  in interbank  repo  transactions  increased  from \nroughly 50% before the crisis to 85% in December 2009, with the quality of the collateral \ndelivered  remaining  unaltered.  This  example  shows  that  a  flexible  delivery  of  foreign \ncollateral and hence a wide range of high-quality collateral can support the functioning and \nresilience of the repo market. The issue of efficient use of collateral is further explored in \nSection 4.5. \nIn addition, the Working Group believes that the providers of repo infrastructures can be in a \ngood position to help address two other more general issues that can affect the resilience of \nrepo markets, namely procyclicality and inadequate transparency in repo markets. These \nissues are further explored in Sections 4.6 and 4.7. Finally, the Working Group has identified \nthree issues \u2013 access to repo clearing and settlement services, governance, and financial \nrisk  management  \u2013  which  might  be  particularly  complex  and  demanding  for  those \ninfrastructure providers that are part of an entity also providing commercial banking services. \nThese considerations are discussed in Section 4.8. \n                                                 \n10  The default of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 highlighted the importance to CCPs of adequate risk \nmanagement and default procedures. For instance, in one country, it took the CCP several days to liquidate \nthe collateral after the failure of Lehman Brothers.  \n \nCPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010  13\n ", " \n4.  Options for strengthening repo clearing and settlement \narrangements \nThe Working Group has identified seven issues or concerns that are particularly relevant for \nor specific to the clearing and settlement of repo transactions. While not all issues are \nrelevant to the same extent in each market, each has the potential to affect the resilience of \nrepo markets. This chapter explores the seven issues in more detail and proposes some \nways in which repo clearing and settlement infrastructures might address these issues.  \nThe proposed options for repo clearing and settlement infrastructures aim to further the \nstability and resilience of the financial system in normal times and in particular during times \nof  stress,  while  preserving  the  financial  system\u2019s  efficiency,  flexibility  and  capacity  for \ninnovation.  A  robust  set  of  arrangements  for  clearing  and  settling  repo  transactions \ncontributes to financial stability by facilitating an efficient and resilient repo market, even in \ntimes of stress, so that (i) banks, securities dealers and other financial institutions can obtain \nshort-term collateralised funding, and (ii) cash-rich financial institutions have a useful, liquid \nand low-counterparty risk investment instrument in which to place short-term funds. It needs \nto be stressed, however, that repo clearing and settlement arrangements cannot fix all \npotential issues in repo markets and need to be complemented by additional measures, \nparticularly in contractual design, market participants\u2019 risk management and the specification \nof eligible collateral for repo transactions. \nDue  to  the  diversity  of  institutional  arrangements  in  repo  clearing  and  settlement,  the \nWorking Group adopted a functional approach. The proposed options are thus directed to all \narrangements used by market participants for clearing or settling repos (including centralised \ncollateral management services), irrespective of whether these services are provided by \ndedicated market infrastructures or commercial banks (eg the clearing banks in the United \nStates). In addition, the Working Group has identified three issues which might be particularly \ncomplex and demanding for infrastructure providers that are part of an entity also providing \ncommercial banking services. These issues \u2013 namely access to repo clearing and settlement \nservices, governance, and financial risk management \u2013 are outlined in Section 4.8 of this \nchapter. \n4.1  Effective mitigation of risks related to intraday credit extensions \nSignificant values of intraday credit can be extended by repo settlement infrastructures (eg in \nthe United States), or by settlement banks supporting the repo infrastructure (eg in the \nUnited Kingdom11). Large credit extensions can be occasioned by the operational design of \nthe  repo  infrastructure.  For  example,  significant  amounts  of  credit  can  be  extended  in \nsystems where the repo infrastructure unwinds all or a large portion of non-maturing term \nrepos at the start of the processing day (usually in the early morning), and only recreates (or \nrewinds)  non-maturing  repos  near  the  close  of  the  processing  day  (usually  in  the  late \nafternoon).12 The unwinding of non-maturing term repo transactions intraday gives a cash \n                                                 \n11  But note that in the United Kingdom, the Bank of England provides intraday liquidity through self-collateralising \nrepos (SCRs) which enable CREST settlement banks to repo their SCR-enabled CREST members\u2019 eligible \nsecurities in return for sterling liquidity to help the settlement bank fund CREST members\u2019 purchase of those \nsecurities. \n12  For instance, in the United States, when non-maturing term repos are unwound or broken at the beginning of \nthe day, the securities used as repo collateral are temporarily transferred back to the securities dealers and \nthe cash borrowed by the securities dealers is temporarily returned to the lenders. By debiting the securities \ndealers\u2019 accounts for large amounts when returning cash to the lenders, the securities dealers\u2019 accounts go \ninto overdraft. The overdrafts are in essence credit extensions made by the clearing banks. In addition, as a \nresult of receiving cash in exchange for collateral, the cash lenders temporarily hold deposits with the clearing \nbanks, not securities.  \n14  CPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010\n  ", " \nborrower the flexibility to substitute securities used as collateral and, at the same time, it is \nsimpler operationally than processing substitutions of collateral individually as needed during \nthe day.13 A cash borrower that is a securities dealer and actively trading a portfolio will need \nsome, or possibly many, of the securities locked up as collateral in repo transactions in order \nto deliver them during the day and meet settlement obligations. Similarly, a securities dealer \nwill receive securities during the day that it would like to use as repo collateral. Unwinding \nterm  repos  early  in  the  day  and  recreating  them  late  in  the  day  simplifies  the  daily \nsubstitution  of  securities  used  as  collateral,  which  expedites  settlement  of  buy-sell \ntransactions and gives securities dealers more opportunities to obtain repo financing for their \nconstantly changing inventory. Cash lenders also benefit because cash borrowers are more \nwilling to engage in term repos in exchange for higher interest rates, provided that the \nspecific securities used as collateral can change daily.  \nLarge credit extensions can also be the product of a repo infrastructure settling maturing \nrepos early in the day and not settling new repos until late in the day.14 This practice, like the \nunwinding of non-maturing term repos, affords more flexibility to cash borrowers, while being \nsimple for the infrastructure to execute. The settlement of maturing repos in the morning \nallows dealers to use securities serving as repo collateral to meet settlement obligations \nthroughout the day and before the maturing repos are rolled over or paid down with cash \nobtained from other sources. In addition, the settlement of new repos in the evening allows a \ndealer  a  better  chance  of  obtaining  repo  financing  for  securities  it  receives  during  the \nafternoon. Benefits accrue to the cash lenders too, as they have more opportunities to find a \nshort-term investment for any surplus cash that becomes available late in the day. \nIn  addition  to  the  large  value  of  intraday  credits  highlighted  above,  the  indiscriminate \nunwinding of repos and the settlement of new repos late in the day can also lead to further \nrisks. First, the sizeable extensions of intraday credit make a repo cash borrower vulnerable \nto risk management decisions by the lender, be it the infrastructure or a settlement bank \nsupporting the infrastructure. Any abrupt change in the infrastructure\u2019s or a settlement bank\u2019s \npolicies and practices can have consequential impacts on a repo market participant when the \namount of intraday credit extended is large and alternative sources of credit are unavailable. \nSecond, the unwinding of repos early in the day means that the cash lender holds a cash \ndeposit intraday instead of securities collateral. Holding an unsecured cash deposit intraday \nimplies counterparty risk, which the cash lender was trying to avoid in the first place by \nentering  into  a  repo.  If  repo  market  participants  become  concerned  about  the  financial \ncondition of the institution where they hold their deposits intraday, they may avoid engaging \nin repos. Third, the unwinding of term repos increases overall settlement volumes, potentially \nleading to higher settlement risks. Finally, the late re-winding of repos may run counter to \nefforts to achieve early finality of repo settlement during the day. \nOptions for repo clearing and settlement infrastructures \nWhere relevant, an infrastructure settling repo transactions might review its practices and \nprocedures to find ways to reduce intraday credit extensions and ensure that the risks related \nto remaining intraday credits are effectively mitigated. Infrastructures have a number of \n                                                 \n13  While some repo infrastructures have the capability to substitute collateral intraday, doing so either takes \naway some flexibility in the use of collateral by cash borrowers or requires substantial IT investments and \nprocessing capabilities if the substitutions are made rapidly and in large numbers. \n14  For instance, in the United States, when maturing repos are settled in the morning, the securities used as repo \ncollateral are transferred back to the securities dealers and the cash borrowed by the securities dealers is \nreturned to the lenders. By debiting the securities dealers\u2019 accounts for additional amounts, the securities \ndealers\u2019 accounts with the clearing banks go into overdraft. And by receiving cash in exchange for collateral, \nthe cash lenders temporarily hold deposits with the clearing banks, not securities, even if they will be entering \ninto new overnight or term repo transactions that same day. \n \nCPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010  15\n ", " \noptions available to establish effective risk controls, with the most reliable approach judged to \nbe a combination of collateralising and limiting credit extensions. A decision to introduce new \nprocedures or additional risk controls should, however, be made judiciously and take into \nconsideration all relevant factors and interests, including the volume and value of repo \nsettlements,  concentrations  in  the  market,  the  reliance  of  financial  institutions  on  repo \nfinancing, the quality of the securities used as collateral, the ability to re-use collateral, and \nthe efficiency of the infrastructure. \nThe practice of unwinding all or the bulk of repo transactions early in the day is already under \nreview in the United Kingdom and the United States. In the United Kingdom, Euroclear UK & \nIreland is currently reviewing its delivery by value (DBV) service \u2013 which provides a method \nof settling term repo instructions as a series of overnight instructions \u2013 by incorporating a \nterm DBV functionality including some automated ability to substitute collateral (CREST also \nprovides a term repo product, but most repo activity appears to be undertaken via DBVs). In \nthe United States, the PRC Task Force on Tri-Party Repo Infrastructure is exploring options \nfor the overhaul of clearing bank settlement procedures, including changing the time of day \nat which maturing repos and new repos are settled, and implementing a facility for automated \ncollateral substitution. In its final report, the PRC Task Force on Tri-Party Repo Infrastructure \nrecommends implementing \u201coperational enhancements to achieve the \u2018practical elimination\u2019 \nof intraday credit by the Clearing Banks\u201d. \n4.2  Transparency of repo clearing and settlement infrastructure roles, \nresponsibilities, practices and procedures \nThe  inadequate  transparency  of  repo  clearing  and  settlement  infrastructure  roles, \nresponsibilities,  practices  and  procedures  can  lead  to  misperceptions  of  the  credit  and \nliquidity risk involved in using the repo infrastructure. It can also undermine confidence in \nusing the infrastructure, particularly in times of market stress.  \nThe presence of an agent in a tri-party repo introduces the potential for ambiguities that do \nnot exist with respect to bilateral repos or buy-sell transactions involving the same securities. \nIn particular, the roles and responsibilities of the tri-party repo service provider can become \nblurred if, for example, following the unwinding of repos the tri-party agent extends intraday \ncredit or overnight securities loans to the cash borrower.15 \nAdditional ambiguity about services, rights and responsibilities can arise if the repo clearing \nand settlement infrastructure is part of an entity also providing commercial banking services. \nIn particular, market participants may raise the question of how confidential information \ngained through the provision of infrastructure services or other banking services could be \nused. \nOptions for repo clearing and settlement infrastructures \nTo make infrastructure arrangements as transparent for repo transactions as they are for \nbuy-sell  transactions,  repo  clearing  and  settlement  infrastructures  might  raise  market \nparticipants\u2019 awareness of and reduce ambiguity surrounding their roles, responsibilities, \n                                                 \n15  In the United States, the PRC Task Force on Tri-Party Repo Infrastructure noted in its December 2009 \nProgress Report that market participants assumed that clearing banks would continue to extend intraday \ncredit, although in reality clearing banks had the right not to do so. There was no detailed description within \nrepo and tri-party documentation regarding the circumstances in which the clearing banks would exercise their \nright to refuse to engage in the morning unwind process (thereby leaving the dealer credit exposures with repo \ninvestors) or when clearing banks would require dealers to post more collateral to the clearing banks itself. In \nother markets where tri-party repo service providers are widely used, uncertainty seemed to have been \ncentred to some extent around the rights, responsibilities and procedures of the tri-party repo service \nproviders in case of a default of a repo counterparty. \n16  CPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010\n  ", " \npractices  and  procedures,  including  the  infrastructure\u2019s  methods  and  data  sources  for \nvaluation  of  the  collateral  provided  to  the  infrastructure  (as  principal  or  as  agent). \nTransparency  allows  participants  to  correctly  assess  the  potential  for  credit  losses  and \nliquidity  pressures  resulting  from  repo  transactions,  including  the  pre-settlement  and \nsettlement risks stemming from the use of the repo clearing and settlement infrastructure. \nThis  is  particularly  important  for  tri-party  repo  service  providers,  whose  rights  and \nresponsibilities (eg in risk management or in the case of a default) have not in all cases been \nentirely clear to the market. \nHowever, it must be emphasised that while market infrastructures should make relevant \ninformation  available,  their  participants  are  also  responsible  for  ensuring  that  they  are \nadequately informed and \u2013 if necessary \u2013 for demanding additional transparency from the \nmarket infrastructures they are using. \nTransparency is particularly critical where infrastructures are part of an entity also providing \ncommercial banking services. In this case, transparency on roles and responsibilities might \nalso encompass how the infrastructure internally shares information and how it ensures that \nconfidential  information  gained  through  the  provision  of  infrastructure  or  other  banking \nservices is not misused. This would address potential concerns of market participants that \nconfidential  information  may  be  used  by  an  infrastructure  to  the  disadvantage  of  its \nparticipants. \n4.3  Effective protection against counterparty credit risk16 \nInsufficient protection against counterparty credit risk in a repo transaction, whether actual or \nperceived, can swiftly deter financial institutions from participating in repo markets. This is \nthe case particularly in times of volatile collateral prices and heightened counterparty credit \nrisk. Concerns can arise due to uncertainty about the value and liquidity of collateral or \ninadequate margins and haircuts. Also, anecdotal evidence suggests that during the financial \ncrisis some repo market participants were reluctant to lend to a counterparty below a certain \ncredit quality, irrespective of the collateral provided. This might be related to a lack of \ntransparency about default procedures and related rights, responsibilities and processes. \nUncertainty  about  legal  risks  in  repo  transactions  and  about  the  speed  and  ease  of \nliquidating collateral and related liquidity risks might also have contributed to this situation \n(see also Section 4.4). Hence, the financial crisis highlighted that in secured transactions too \nparticipants are concerned with the credit quality of their counterparty, irrespective of the \nquality of the collateral received.  \nCounterparty risk concerns can be addressed to some extent by the use of CCPs that take \nover the counterparty risk in a repo transaction and become the cash lender to every cash \nborrower  and  the  cash  borrower  to  every  cash  lender.  The  effectiveness  of  a  CCP  in \nmitigating counterparty risk will depend on its own robustness and the scope for multilateral \nnetting, which can reduce the open exposures from repos. In turn, netting efficiency will \ndepend on market structure, participant numbers, the trading patterns of participants, and \nwhether the CCP also clears outright transactions in the underlying repo securities. \nThe CCP-cleared German Eurex Repo market, and especially its Euro GC Pooling segment, \nas well as the CCP-cleared GC repo segments in France, the United Kingdom and the \nUnited States (cleared by LCH.Clearnet SA, LCH.Clearnet Ltd and FICC, respectively), were \n                                                 \n16  This section focuses on the counterparty risk taken by the cash lender. However, if the repo is over-\ncollateralised (eg through margins or haircuts), the cash borrower in a repo can also face counterparty risk. \nCCPs can reduce these exposures for the cash borrower. In addition, Euroclear Bank, for example, offers a \nservice that aims to reduce unsecured exposures by allowing the transfer of an initial margin to a dedicated \naccount opened in the name of Euroclear Bank, instead of transferring it to the cash lender. \n \nCPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010  17\n ", " \nthe only repo markets that saw an increase in outstanding values during the financial crisis. \nIn other European markets, there are indications that the reduction in outstanding repo \nvalues was less pronounced for CCP-cleared repos than for other repo segments. \nOptions for repo clearing and settlement infrastructures \nRepo  clearing  and  settlement  infrastructures  can  play  different  roles  in  mitigating \ncounterparty risk. In particular, stakeholders in the repo market might evaluate carefully and \ncomprehensively the benefits and limitations of introducing or promoting the wider use of a \nCCP for the repo market (for a discussion of the benefits, limitations and some particularities \nof CCPs in repo markets, see Box 1 in Chapter 2).  \nIf  a  CCP  is  considered  appropriate,  it  can  help  reduce  market  participants\u2019  level  of \ncounterparty  credit  risk.  Provided  that  the  CCP  has  a  strong  and  transparent  risk \nmanagement framework, has sufficient financial resources and is adequately regulated, it \nbecomes a financially robust counterparty for CCP-eligible transactions. This reduces the \nprobability  that  elevated  counterparty  credit  concerns  would  lead  market  participants  to \ncease trading, thereby restricting access to funding.  \nIrrespective of the presence of a CCP, repo infrastructures might evaluate whether and how \nthey can assist participants in managing counterparty risk more effectively. For instance, \npotential  measures  might  be  geared  towards  reducing  market  participants\u2019  uncertainty \nsurrounding exposures at various points during the life cycle of the repo transaction (see also \nSection 4.2), assisting market participants in determining and implementing the methodology \nfor  collateral  eligibility  and  valuation,  or  supporting  their  participants\u2019  preparations  for \ncollateral liquidation (see also Section 4.4). \n4.4  Adequate capabilities for collateral liquidation  \nIf the liquidation of repo collateral following the default of a cash borrower does not proceed \nsmoothly, the needs or expectations of the cash lenders will not be met. For cash lenders to \nquickly recover the full amount of the loan, they must be entitled and operationally able to \ntake possession of repo collateral soon after a default. In addition, cash lenders must be able \nto execute the liquidation of repo collateral successfully. This means that the process must \nbe administered so that the transfer and the sale of the securities are timely, efficient (not \nexcessively costly or hampered by errors), and effective in obtaining a good sale price. For \nthis to occur, certain steps must be taken in advance: the cash lender in a repo must \nestablish brokerage agreements, draw up and sign contracts, and assign staff to the various \ntasks. Experience from the financial crisis has shown that in a few repo markets even some \nsignificant cash lenders, especially non-banks, were unready to take control of and liquidate \nrepo collateral.  \nThe  liquidation  of  repo  collateral  could  also  go  awry  because  a  substantial  amount  of \ncollateral would need to be liquidated following the default by a large financial institution that \nis a heavy user of cash-driven repos. The liquidation of a sizeable amount of collateral \ncreates the potential for a fire sale or panic selling, which could initiate or amplify a significant \nsudden fall in securities prices. A fire sale can be precipitated by regulations, internal risk \nmanagement  practices,  fear  of  reputational  damage,  or  other  factors  that  compel  cash \nlenders  (collateral  takers)  to  sell  quickly  and  without  regard  to  market  conditions.  The \npotential for a fire sale is a function of the liquidity and depth of the markets for the securities \nserving as repo collateral, which may be impaired by stress in the financial system. The \npotential for a fire sale is also a function of the sources of liquidity available to the cash \nlender, which are chiefly same-day market transactions and pre-arranged liquidity lines from \ncommercial banks. They could also include central bank liquidity facilities for which the cash \nlender would be eligible. \n18  CPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010\n  ", " \nOptions for repo clearing and settlement infrastructures17 \nTri-party repo service providers and potentially also CSDs could evaluate whether and how \nthey might play a role in supporting their participants\u2019 preparations for taking possession of \nand liquidating collateral. Some options are outlined below, though their feasibility will need \nto be investigated in the context of each market and market infrastructure. In particular, it \nmust be acknowledged that most CSDs might not be in a position to discriminate between \nregular buy-sell transactions and repo transactions.  \nFirst, to facilitate immediate access to repo collateral, market infrastructures could offer cash \nlenders real-time reporting facilities on the securities received as collateral. Moreover, market \ninfrastructures could help to raise market participants\u2019 awareness about the necessary steps \nin taking possession of and liquidating collateral and potential difficulties which might be \nfaced  during  these  processes  (this  could  be  particularly  relevant  for  smaller  or  less \nexperienced repo market participants). Going further, market infrastructures could help draft \nsample checklists and procedures, which would allow their participants to evaluate and \npotentially enhance their own preparations. Finally, tri-party repo service providers could \nprovide facilities and services which would directly support the liquidation of collateral. This \ncould include, for example, the provision of advisors to its participants, who would monitor \nthe transfer of collateral and assist in liquidating collateral on behalf of participants.  \nAlternatively, repo transactions could be cleared by a CCP, transferring the responsibility of \nliquidating collateral from market participants to the CCP.18 If CCPs are better prepared to \ntake possession of and liquidate collateral than some market participants, the introduction of \na CCP or their wider use can increase the likelihood that collateral can be liquidated in an \norderly manner. However, as a CCP concentrates exposures in the repo markets, it could \npotentially face the liquidation of very large collateral amounts. Hence, the CCP should put \ngreat emphasis on ensuring that it is well prepared for such a liquidation.  \nReducing the probability of a fire sale is in essence a collective action problem for the cash \nlenders  in  a  repo  market.19  To  address  the  threat  of  fire  sale  conditions,  regulatory \nauthorities, market participants and repo infrastructures could evaluate the impact, risks and \nthe feasibility of some of the options available to repo clearing and settlement infrastructures \nin particular and repo markets in general. One option for consideration could be that a CSD \nor tri-party repo service provider, provided that it is within its capacity to do so, imposes on \nbehalf of market participants various restrictions or requirements as a preventive measure. \nFor example, it could place limits on the aggregate value of repo contracts for individual \ncounterparties, or eligibility requirements for the securities used as collateral. Restrictive \nmeasures of this type, however, have their pros and cons, and in any case, may only serve \nto divert short-term lending from repo transactions to other segments of the money market. A \nsecond option could be the introduction or promotion of the wider use of a CCP, though it \ndepends on the circumstances whether a CCP would be in a better position to avoid fire sale \nconditions. To the extent that central clearing brings about multilateral netting benefits, the \noverall amounts of collateral to be liquidated by the CCP will be lower. Moreover, a CCP can \nmonitor the collateral delivered by its counterparties and potentially set collateral-specific \n                                                 \n17  With respect to preparations for liquidating collateral and avoiding or dealing with fire sale conditions, bank \nsupervisors and market regulators should also inquire into the readiness of banks and non-bank financial \ninstitutions to liquidate repo collateral from a defaulting counterparty. This measure is, however, not directed \ntowards market infrastructures and therefore not detailed further. \n18  However, should the CCP reserve the right to reallocate the collateral back to the surviving participants under \ncertain circumstances (eg if there are no adequate prices for the securities it has taken possession of), the \nonus to liquidate collateral could fall back on the CCP\u2019s participants. \n19  Measures to be considered for preventing fire sale conditions by individual market participants or by market \nauthorities are not covered here. \n \nCPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010  19\n ", " \nconcentration limits. However, the probability of fire sale conditions will also be affected by \nthe CCP\u2019s time horizon for liquidating collateral, which would depend on \u2013 among other \nfactors \u2013 the availability of pre-arranged sources of liquidity and the employment of derivative \ninstruments to hedge credit and market risks. It is thus not clear whether a CCP can be more \npatient than other market participants. A third option for solving the collective action problem \nwould be for market participants to come together and form a facility that is dedicated to \nliquidating repo collateral after a default. This special purpose entity would be a new type of \nmarket infrastructure.20  \n4.5  Efficient use of collateral \nThe  efficient  and  flexible  use  of  collateral  facilitates  market  participants\u2019  collateral \nmanagement and can contribute to the development of liquid and smoothly functioning repo \nmarkets in normal times. In addition, the efficient and flexible use of collateral can also \nenhance the resilience of repo markets in times of stress, when repo markets typically \nexperience  a  shift  towards  high-quality  collateral  (eg  government  securities).21  In  these \ncircumstances, clearing and settlement infrastructures that allow cash lenders and borrowers \nto adapt to changing collateral requirements can contribute to preserving market liquidity. \nThe CPSS report on Cross-border collateral arrangements published in 2006 investigated \nthe arrangements for transferring collateral across borders and currency areas.22 It was \nnoted that internationally active banks may face mismatches between the location of their \nliquidity needs and the collateral they hold. This was attributed among other factors to \ninefficient  or  missing  linkages  between  some  market  infrastructures.  Hence,  market \nparticipants  might  face  difficulties  in  adapting  to  changing  collateral  requirements. \nFragmented infrastructures can also negatively influence the availability of certain and timely \ninformation on the settlement status of repo transactions.  \nIn the euro area, where market infrastructures are relatively fragmented, the national central \nbanks and the ECB are actively engaged in various projects (eg T2S, CCBM2), which will \ndeliver integrated and efficient market infrastructures for the euro area financial market and \nfor Eurosystem counterparties. This is complemented by industry efforts (eg the European \nRepo Council23) and other official initiatives (eg COGESI24). \nFlexibility in managing collateral can also be enhanced by the option of substituting and re-\nusing collateral. While all the markets analysed offer some collateral substitution or re-use \n                                                 \n20  Another idea for forestalling a fire sale is to call on a CCP for buy-sell transactions to assist after a default, \neven if it is not serving as a CCP for repo transactions. A portion of the collateral in the possession of repo \ncash lenders after a default could be used by a CCP to meet buy-sell settlement obligations it had assumed \nfrom the defaulting participant. By taking repo collateral and delivering it to its counterparties, a CCP would \nreduce the amount of collateral that would need to be sold into the market. \n21  For example, in CGFS Publications no 37, The functioning and resilience of cross-border funding markets, \nMarch 2010, it was noted that in the United States tri-party repo market during the financial crisis a significant \nportion of the securities normally financed through the repo markets were largely rejected by lenders. \nCollateral was largely confined to securities eligible in Federal Reserve open market operations. \n22  While the analysis in that report was primarily focused on efficient collateralisation of intraday borrowings from \ncentral banks, the main implications are also valid for collateral in repo markets. \n23  See European Repo Council, The operation of the European repo market, the role of short-selling, the \nproblem of settlement failures and the need for reform of the market infrastructure, July 2010. \n24  The COGESI (Contact group on euro securities infrastructures) addresses issues and developments which \nare relevant for the euro securities settlement industry and which are of common interest for the Eurosystem, \nmarket infrastructures and market participants. The COGESI, which is chaired by the ECB, consists of \nrepresentatives of the Eurosystem and representatives of commercial banks, securities settlement systems \nand clearing houses mainly from the euro area.  \n20  CPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010\n  ", " \nfunctionalities, their availability can be restricted or their use operationally cumbersome. Also, \nin some markets, substitution or re-use is only achieved by measures which in turn imply the \nextension of significant amounts of intraday credits or the increase in settlement risks (eg by \ndaily unwinds). \nOptions for repo clearing and settlement infrastructures \nWhile all linkages between infrastructures involve certain risks that need to be properly \nevaluated and managed, it needs to be acknowledged that efficient and secure linkages \nbetween  clearing  and  settlement  infrastructures  can  facilitate  the  transfer  of  collateral \nbetween different markets and countries, mitigating the inefficiencies caused by fragmented \ninfrastructure.  Linkages  are  relevant  in  particular  for  market  participants  active  at \ninternational level and in various markets, which are cleared and settled at different locations.  \nThe implementation of efficient linkages between clearing and settlement infrastructures \ncould enhance the capacity of market participants to deal with unexpected collateral needs \nand  collateral  mismatches  and  therefore  enhance  repo  market  resilience.  Therefore,  if \nmarket participants demonstrate that efficient linkages would materially facilitate collateral \nmanagement and the settlement of repo transactions, repo infrastructures could evaluate the \npotential benefits and costs of establishing such linkages.  \nThe 2006 CPSS report on Cross-border collateral arrangements also proposed increased \ntransparency regarding payments and collateral movements, eg in the form of real-time \ninformation on the current status of individual payments, collateral holdings and transfers. \nThis would reduce uncertainty regarding repo settlement and collateralisation processes and \nwould allow market participants to use existing collateral more efficiently. \nRepo clearing and settlement infrastructures might also evaluate whether substitution and re-\nuse of collateral could facilitate a more flexible use of collateral in repo markets. This could \nincrease  the  liquidity  and  resilience  of  the  repo  market,  and  reduce  the  bias  towards \novernight or short-term repo. In particular, the possibility of re-using collateral for re-financing \nwith the central bank can enhance the resilience of repo markets. This is the case in the \nEurex Repo GC Pooling Segment and in the Swiss repo market, where cash lenders can re-\nuse collateral received in interbank repo transactions for re-financing with the central bank. In \nthese two countries, collateral eligibility criteria for the interbank repo market and central \nbank operations are to a large degree identical. This extends the cash lenders\u2019 liquidity buffer \nand enhances their willingness to lend cash during times of stress.  \nAs substitution and re-use can be achieved in different ways, repo infrastructures should \nconsider the potential implications in terms of settlement risk or intraday liquidity needs. Also, \nthere are limits to combining substitution and re-use of collateral in the same market. \n4.6  Mitigating procyclical effects of risk management practices \nA recent CGFS report observes that a sharp tightening of the terms for secured lending, \nincluding cash-driven repos, occurred as financial market conditions deteriorated during the \nfinancial crisis.25 This tightening contributed to a contraction in the supply of short-term credit \nto  financial  institutions,  which  in  turn  intensified  liquidity  pressures.  To  mitigate  such \nfluctuations in the availability of liquidity, the report proposes that margins and haircuts on \nsecured lending transactions be calibrated to conditions in stressed financial markets.  \nIn repo markets cleared by a CCP, the CCP must manage the credit and liquidity risks it \nassumes. A CCP has several means available to manage the risks it bears. Foremost among \n                                                 \n25  See CGFS Publications no 36, The role of margin requirements and haircuts in procyclicality, March 2010. \n \nCPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010  21\n ", " \nthese means are the imposition of margin requirements or haircuts, as well as restrictions on \nthe range of securities that may be used as collateral. An unanticipated substantial increase \nin its margins or haircuts, or a tightening of a CCP\u2019s collateral eligibility criteria could reduce \nliquidity in repo markets. \nTri-party repo service providers, CSDs, settlement banks, or custodian banks settling repo \ntransactions might also bear credit and liquidity risk, particularly if they extend credit intraday \nin order to expedite the settlement process. To manage such risks, these entities may \nimpose haircuts on or apply margins to securities used to collateralise intraday credit. During \nthe financial crisis, some tri-party repo service providers were compelled to impose higher \nhaircuts on collateral in order to protect themselves against the credit exposures they bore \nintraday during settlement. Sudden increases in haircuts and margins could reduce liquidity \nin repo markets, particularly if there is insufficient transparency on the practices and rules for \nrevising or adjusting haircuts and margins. \nOptions for repo clearing and settlement infrastructures \nThere are various ways in which repo clearing and settlement infrastructures can mitigate \nprocyclical  effects  in  repo  markets.  For  instance,  it  would  be  useful  for  participants  to \nunderstand clearly the processes and models that a repo infrastructure or a settlement bank \nuses to set margins and haircuts. If the factors serving as inputs to the model can be tracked, \nparticipants would be capable of anticipating the timing and size of changes in margins and \nhaircuts,  which  would  allow  cash  borrowers  to  prepare  for  potential  near-term  liquidity \npressures. Disseminating this information would be part of a broader effort to foster the \ntransparency of the repo clearing and settlement infrastructure practices and procedures \n(see Section 4.2) and of the repo market in general (see Section 4.7). \nRepo clearing and settlement infrastructures could also avoid making large discrete changes \nto the relevant risk management parameters. In addition, any change should be made in a \ntransparent way and with sufficient lead time to allow participants in the repo infrastructure to \nadjust accordingly.  \nIn addition, focusing on the role of CCPs, the CGFS report recommends considering the \nprudential impacts and practical implications of imposing, through CCPs, minimum constant \nthrough-the-cycle margins and haircuts. To the extent that other repo infrastructures also \nbear credit and liquidity risks, the Working Group believes that this consideration is relevant \nnot only to CCPs but to repo infrastructures more generally.  \n4.7  Transparency of the repo market \nThe defensive behaviour of repo market participants during the financial crisis was driven by \nthe perception of a sharp increase in the credit and liquidity risks inherent in cash-driven repo \ntransactions. A lack of transparency in the repo market is believed to have been a factor \ncontributing  to  this  defensive  behaviour.  As  a  general  rule,  insufficient  or  asymmetric \ninformation in financial markets triggers an overreaction. In this regard, the industry-led PRC \nTask Force on Tri-Party Repo Infrastructure in the United States cites poor transparency as \nan area of concern. More specifically, it identifies as problematic the sparse quantitative \ninformation  that  is  available  on  the  repo  market\u2019s  size,  composition,  and  structure.  In \naddition, a CGFS study group identifies greater market transparency as one of the reasons \nto promote the use of centralised clearing infrastructures for repo transactions.26  \nSummary statistics describing the repo market can be derived from either responses to \nsurveys  of  market  participants  or  data  supplied  by  repo  clearing  and  settlement \n                                                 \n26  See CGFS Publications no 36, The role of margin requirements and haircuts in procyclicality, March 2010. \n22  CPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010\n  ", " \ninfrastructures. In Europe, a periodic disclosure to support transparency in the cash-driven \nrepo market has already been implemented by the International Capital Market Association \n(ICMA). It conducts semi-annual surveys of financial institutions and disseminates a profile of \nthe repo market in Europe. In addition, the ECB, in cooperation with the Eurosystem\u2019s \nnational central banks, regularly conducts a Euro Money Market Survey, which covers the \nsecured lending market, including repo transactions. In Japan, statistics are collected by \nmarket associations, and the Bank of Japan has conducted surveys on money markets \nincluding repos. On the part of repo infrastructures, some repo CCPs, including Eurex and \nthe Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, provide information on market indicators such as \naggregate value and interest rate for the transactions they clear.27   \nWhether to base repo market statistics on survey results or data collected by infrastructures \nis an open matter. There are, however, two clear arguments in favour of infrastructures as \nthe data source: (i) summary statistics would be based on the universe of transactions, not \non survey findings that are susceptible to sampling error, and (ii) data would be collected at \nlower  cost  and  higher  frequency.  Not  all  repo  clearing  and  settlement  infrastructures, \nhowever, may be capable of identifying data specifically on repo transactions, as they do not \ndistinguish between repo transactions \u2013 in particular, bilateral repos \u2013 and regular buy-sell \ntransactions.  \nOptions for repo clearing and settlement infrastructures \nMaking available to participants vital summary statistics on the repo market would help to \nenhance  transparency.  In  support  of  initiatives  to  improve  market  transparency,  a  repo \ninfrastructure could make data available that meet the genuine information needs of market \nparticipants. An infrastructure could cooperate with industry groups or other responsible \nbodies that would be in a position to define meaningful summary statistics and distribute the \nassembled information in an appropriate way. This guidance, given in the context of the repo \nmarket, is congruent with private and public sector initiatives to foster market transparency in \nother financial markets. In particular, industry-led Foreign Exchange Committees in several \ncountries, working in collaboration, conduct periodic surveys of financial institutions and \npublish  statistics  on  turnover  and  market  concentrations  in  foreign  exchange  markets. \nMoreover, the recently released CPSS-IOSCO consultative report Considerations for trade \nrepositories in OTC derivatives markets states that a trade repository should support the \ntransparency of OTC derivatives markets by making data available to the public.  \nMeaningful summary statistics on the repo market could provide information on several \ndimensions, including: \n\uf0b7  the aggregate size of the market, measured by the total amount of funds borrowed \nand lent (outstanding amounts and turnover); \n\uf0b7  the composition of the securities used as collateral, by asset type, credit quality, \ncurrency denomination or country/jurisdiction of issue, or other characteristics; \n\uf0b7  the participation in the market indicating the types of financial institutions and non-\nfinancial entities; \n\uf0b7  the  concentration  in  the  market  on  the  cash  lending  and  cash  borrowing  side \n(outstanding amounts and turnover); \n\uf0b7  the maturity structure of outstanding repo transactions, possibly summarised by \nweighted average time to maturity; \n                                                 \n27  Efforts to improve transparency are being planned for the United States\u2019 repo market. The industry-led PRC \nTask Force on Tri-Party Repo Infrastructure intends to disseminate a monthly profile of the market. This \nmonthly profile would be based on transaction data provided by the infrastructure, that is, the clearing banks. \n \nCPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010  23\n ", " \n\uf0b7  a representative range of typical haircuts and margins applied by cash lenders \n(collateral takers) in cash-driven repo transactions (see Section 4.6 on mitigating \nprocyclicality); and \n\uf0b7  the percentage of CCP-cleared repo transactions in total repo transactions.  \nThe summary statistics should be constructed in a way that preserves the confidentiality of \nindividual  counterparties.  In  addition,  rules  should  be  considered  that  ensure  the \ndissemination  of  information  to  market  participants  and  the  public  will  not  contribute  to \nmarket dysfunction or give one stakeholder a commercial advantage over others. \n4.8  Considerations related to repo infrastructures that are part of an entity also \nproviding commercial banking services \nAs noted in the introduction to Chapter 4, the diversity of institutional arrangements in repo \nclearing and settlement infrastructures underscores the importance of adopting a functional \napproach. In addition, the Working Group has identified three issues for repo clearing and \nsettlement infrastructures which \u2013 while not posing risks going beyond those for financial \nmarket infrastructures more generally \u2013 might be particularly complex and demanding for \nthose infrastructure providers which are part of an entity also providing commercial banking \nservices. These institution-specific considerations are outlined below.  \nFirst,  in  line  with  current  standards  for  financial  market  infrastructures  on  access,  repo \nclearing and settlement infrastructures in general should ensure fair and open access. If an \ninfrastructure provider is also a competitor of some of its participants, ensuring fair and open \naccess is particularly crucial to prevent the perception that access to infrastructure services \nis blocked, restricted or withdrawn for competitive reasons, ie not solely based on objective \ncriteria. Access should also not be influenced by interests in other business lines. This is \nparticularly critical for repo clearing and settlement infrastructures, as access to repo markets \nis  essential  for  the  short-term  funding  of  cash  borrowers.  The  exclusion  from  a  repo \ninfrastructure  could  hence  lead  to  severe  liquidity  issues  for  the  participant  concerned, \npotentially triggering its default.  \nSecond, in line with current standards for financial market infrastructures on governance, \nrepo clearing and settlement infrastructures in general should have in place arrangements to \nensure that \u2013 in addition to the objectives of the owners \u2013 the interests of participants, \nsecurities  issuers  and  the  broader  public  are  also  taken  into  account.  Where  a  repo \ninfrastructure is part of an entity providing commercial banking services, great care should be \ntaken to reflect the interests of all stakeholders (including users which are potentially also \ncompetitors) adequately in the governance processes. \nFinally, to preserve participants\u2019 confidence in the repo clearing and settlement infrastructure \nit is critical to maintain the infrastructure provider\u2019s financial health. Confidence could be \nundermined by financial losses from other (banking) activities which could spill over and put \nthe infrastructure activities at risk. Hence, if an infrastructure provider is part of an entity also \nproviding  commercial  banking  activities,  there  should  be  measures  that  minimise  the \npotential for financial risks from other business activities to spill over to and impede the \ninfrastructure services. If an infrastructure provider fails to take preventive measures against \nsuch spillovers, there is a significant risk that the infrastructure would experience a loss of \nconfidence in times of crisis, or when other business activities are unprofitable.28  \n                                                 \n28  This is particularly the case if the infrastructure provider carries exposures vis-\u00e0-vis infrastructure participants, \neg by extending intraday credits or if it acts as a CCP. \n24  CPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010\n  ", " \n5.  Conclusion \nDuring the recent financial crisis, repo markets proved to be a less reliable source of funding \nliquidity than expected in some countries. This report has investigated the extent to which the \nmarket infrastructure \u2013 ie the practices, procedures and systems used for clearing and \nsettling  repos  and  liquidating  a  defaulting  cash  borrower\u2019s  collateral  \u2013  added  to  the \nuncertainty  in  repo  markets  during  the  financial  crisis  and  whether  there  is  room  for \nimprovement. \nIn essence, the report has identified several issues directly or indirectly related to the repo \nmarket infrastructure that have the potential to affect the resilience of repo markets. With a \nview to enhancing the resilience of repo markets, the report has also discussed various \noptions  for  addressing  the  identified  issues  and  strengthening  the  repo  clearing  and \nsettlement infrastructure.  \nAs the specific arrangements for clearing and settling repo transactions vary considerably \nacross countries or markets, not all the issues identified in this report are relevant to the \nsame extent in each market. Nevertheless, the Working Group believes that it is worthwhile \nfor the stakeholders in each repo market to review how the repo market infrastructure could \nbe further strengthened. As a first step, the providers of repo market infrastructures in each \ncountry, jointly with market participants, regulators and the central bank, should attempt to \ndevelop a common view on the relevance of the identified issues for their market. Based on \nthat, each repo market infrastructure could then evaluate which measure or combination of \nmeasures would be best suited to address the relevant issues in its specific circumstances. \nThe range of options discussed in Chapter 4 of this report could be a starting point to \nfacilitate this evaluation, but it should not be considered as comprehensive.  \n \n \nCPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010  25\n ", " \nAnnex 1: \nThe repo life cycle and the role of market infrastructures  \nThis annex outlines the processing steps of a typical repo transaction, following the overview \nprovided in Figure 1 in Chapter 2. It describes the role of market infrastructure arrangements \nin these steps and highlights some country-specific aspects. Further, this annex lists various \nfactors  explaining  the  array  of  differences  between  repo  clearing  and  settlement \narrangements in the analysed countries. For a comprehensive cross-country comparison of \nrepo clearing and settlement arrangements see Annex 2. \nDocumentation  \nThe  contractual  basis  for  repos  varies  from  country  to  country.  International  master \nagreements such as the TBMA29/ICMA30 Global Master Repurchase Agreement (GMRA) or \nthe  United  States-focused  MRA  are  frequently  used.  In  some  countries  (eg  France, \nGermany,  Japan,  Switzerland),  domestic  master  agreements  are  used  by  domestic \ncounterparties  alongside  the  GMRA.  In  other  countries,  the  international  GMRA  is \ncomplemented  by  domestic  annexes  in  order  to  adapt  to  product-specific  and  legal \ncircumstances of the respective country (eg Canada). The European Master Agreement \n(EMA) attempts to replace the domestic master agreements in the euro area, but its use \nremains  limited.  In  addition,  in  Italy  bilateral  contracts  are  used  instead  of  master \nagreements. In Sweden important market participants like the Riksbank and the Swedish \nNational Debt Office have their own contracts for repos; also in Japan, the Bank of Japan \nhas its own repurchase agreement contract. \nThe  contracts  between  the  cash  lender  and  the  cash  borrower  are  complemented  by \nagreements  between  participants  and  key  infrastructures,  eg  trading  systems,  central \ncounterparties, securities settlement systems, payment systems as well as tri-party repo \nservice providers. For example in the United States tri-party repo services, this takes the \nform of a joint tri-party custodial agreement with the clearing bank, in which the clearing bank \nserves as custodian for both counterparties. In highly standardised repos cleared via a CCP, \nthese contracts between participants and key infrastructures might also replace the GMRA. \nTrade execution  \nRepo  transactions  are  typically  agreed  bilaterally  between  cash  lenders  and  borrowers, \neither on electronic trading systems or through phone or e-mail. Some inter-dealer trades are \nalso brokered, through broker screens or via phone. Examples for electronic trading systems \ninclude  BrokerTec  (United  States,  Europe),  Eurex  Repo  (Germany  and  Switzerland), \nTradeWeb (United States tri-party repos), MTS (Italy, United Kingdom), and inter-dealer \nbroker electronic platforms (Canada and for GCF repos in the United States). \nTrading of repo transactions is less standardised and less often electronic compared to buy-\nsell  securities  transactions.  This  can  most  likely  be  attributed  to  the  lower  transaction \nnumbers and the higher need for bespoke trades in repo reflecting their role for managing \nliquidity.  \n                                                 \n29  The Bond Market Association. \n30  ICMA (International Capital Market Association) came into existence in July 2005 by a merger of the \nInternational Primary Market Association and of International Securities Market Association (ISMA). ISMA \nitself was the former Association of International Bond Dealers (AIBD), founded in 1969. \n26  CPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010\n  ", " \nIn the United States short-term repos are often used for longer-term financing, which is \nachieved by repeated rollovers (or renewals) with the same counterparty. This is typically the \ncase in transactions conducted over the phone. Where electronic trading platforms exist, \nconstant rolling over of repos with the same counterparty is more difficult to achieve.  \nConfirmation/matching \nDepending on how trades are executed, confirmations and affirmations of the economic \nterms of repo transactions are done over phone, fax, e-mail and on electronic platforms such \nas  Bloomberg,  TRAX  and  SWIFT.  Electronic  trading  platforms,  CCPs  (eg  Eurex  Repo, \nFICC-GSD)  and  in  some  cases  securities  settlement  systems  (eg  the  Euroclear  Trade \nCapture  and  Matching  System  ETCMS,  and  Clearstream  Luxembourg\u2019s  trade  capture \nfunction within CmaX) also provide the relevant confirmations. \nThe matching process for settlement instructions stemming from a repo transaction depends \non how trades are executed and the specific infrastructure set-up in the country. If trades are \nexecuted  bilaterally  over  phone  or  e-mail,  each  trading  party  is  usually  responsible  for \nentering the settlement instructions into the relevant settlement systems, where they are \nmatched. This can be typically done through SWIFT or the customised interfaces of the \nsettlement systems. If trades are executed on electronic trading platforms, it depends on the \ntrading platform whether pre-matched instructions are sent directly from the platform to the \nsecurities settlement system, or whether the participants send the instructions individually to \nthe securities settlement systems where they are matched. When CCPs are involved, the \nmatched instructions are in some cases also sent from the CCP to the settlement venues \n(eg in France). \nCentral counterparty (CCP) clearing \nCCPs  become  the  lender  to  the  borrower  and  the  borrower  to  the  lender  in  a  repo \ntransaction. Repo CCPs cover the counterparty risk in the repo transaction between the \nsettlement of the purchase leg and the settlement of the repurchase leg. They typically also \ncover the replacement cost risk that would occur if one counterparty failed to settle the \npurchase leg.  \nThe CPSS countries analysed can be categorised according to the relevance of CCPs in \ntheir  repo  markets.  In  Germany,  Italy,  France,  Japan  and  the  United  Kingdom,  central \ncounterparties are core parts of the repo infrastructure arrangements. Central counterparties \nexist \u2013 but are of limited relevance \u2013 in the United States and Canada. However, Canada is \nin the process of introducing a new CCP for the repo market and Sweden is about to launch \nits first repo CCP. Finally, central counterparties are presently not used for the repo markets \nin Hong Kong and Switzerland, although Switzerland is evaluating the introduction of a repo \nCCP.  \nThe repo CCPs mentioned above are all part of an existing CCP that also clears other \nmarket segments. Repo transactions are cleared on the same platform as regular buy-sell \ntransactions and the CCPs also net within and between these transactions. Participation \ncriteria for repo counterparties vary but typically limit participation to banks and in some \ncases to other regulated entities.  \nUse of a CCP brings about multilateral netting benefits and reduces settlement instructions to \na single cash and \u2013 assuming that a collateral basket is specified \u2013 a single securities \ntransfer. Lower settlement volumes and values allow settlement risk and operational risk \nrelated to settlement to be reduced. \nThe repo CCPs in the markets analysed clear both overnight and term repos. Often, for risk \nmanagement reasons and in response to the demands of market participants, CCPs only \nclear repos against high-quality and liquid collateral, such as government bonds and other \nsecurities with a similar credit rating, which constitute the bulk of repo transactions. \nCPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010  27\n  ", " \nSettlement of purchase leg  \nThe purchase leg is settled on the value date. In all markets analysed, settlement of the \npurchase (and the repurchase leg) is conducted with the delivery-versus-payment (DVP) \nmechanism. The collateral transfer settles in the securities settlement system (CSDs and \nICSDs, in the United States in the clearing banks), while the cash transfer settles in the \ndomestic LVPS or on cash accounts at the CSD/ICSD or at clearing banks or settlement \nbanks. In all markets, settlement takes place in existing payment and securities settlement \nsystems, sometimes complemented by specific repo modules, eg for the automated selection \nof collateral.  \nSettlement  of  the  cash  leg  of  a  repo  transaction  is  either  in  central  bank  money  or \ncommercial bank money. Central bank money is the settlement asset in Hong Kong, Japan, \nSweden and Switzerland (only CHF repos), for example. In the euro area, if repo collateral is \nsettled via a domestic CSD or via direct links between European CSDs, the cash settlement \ntakes place in central bank money. Settlement is in commercial bank money when repo \ncollateral is settled in an ICSD or when the collateral was issued in an ICSD or in a CSD \noutside Europe. Settlement of the cash leg of foreign currency repos in the euro area is also \nin commercial bank money. In the tiered United Kingdom set-up, sterling and euro settlement \nbetween two settlement banks occurs in central bank money under DVP model 1.31 In the \nUnited States, settlement of the cash leg of repos is mostly in commercial bank money, with \nthe exception of some inter-dealer DVP repos, which settle in Fedwire Securities.  \nThe settlement lag for repo transactions is often shorter than for buy-sell transactions. For \nexample in Japan and Switzerland, term repos are usually settled two days after trade \nexecution (t+2), while regular buy-sell transactions are settled t+3. These settlement lags are \ntypically complemented by shorter settlement lags for overnight transactions (which settle \nalso t+0 and t+1). In the United States, while there are some forward-starting tri-party repos, \nthe vast majority is settled t+0, presumably to provide the means for broker-dealers to obtain \nfinancing  of  a  constantly  changing  inventory  of  securities.  In  contrast,  the  standard \nsettlement lag for buy-sell transactions in the United States is t+1. \nIn several markets, collateral securities are selected according to an automated process. The \nCSD/ICSD or the clearing bank selects the type and quantity of securities on pre-specified \ncriteria (eg collateral basket, maturity of securities, future corporate action dates of securities, \nmarket value of securities) from the cash borrower\u2019s pool of available securities. In addition, \ncash  lenders  and  cash  borrowers  can  also  choose  to  manually  pre-specify  or  select a \nspecific security to be used as collateral for a specific repo transaction. This must be defined \neither when the transaction is executed, or when the purchase leg settles.  \nThe intraday timing of the settlement of the cash and the securities leg of a repo transaction \ndepends on the settlement windows of the relevant market infrastructures. In a few cases, \nthe  timing  of  the  settlement  of  the  purchase  and  repurchase  leg of  repos  starting  and \nterminating on the same day is coordinated, which can both reduce the amount of intraday \nliquidity needed for the repo settlement and reduce the length of time of intraday credit \nextensions. For example, for repos in Japan cleared in the Japan Government Bond Clearing \nCorporation (JGBCC), the purchase and the repurchase leg are netted and settled at the \nsame time. Participants in Euroclear Bank and BoNY Mellon Brussels are offered net cash \ntransfer  instructions  for  payments  related  to  maturing  and  new  tri-party  transactions.  In \nSwitzerland, the purchase and repurchase leg are loosely linked, as the instructions for the \nrepurchase leg are sent five minutes before sending the instructions for the purchase leg.  \n                                                 \n31  Settlement between two clients of the same settlement bank occurs in commercial bank money. All settlement \nin US dollars also occurs in commercial bank money. \n28  CPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010\n  ", " \nRepo  settlement  is  in  many  cases  embedded  in  the  settlement  of  regular  buy-sell \ntransactions (eg in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden and the \nICSDs). Whether repo transactions are netted for settlement depends on the netting rules of \nthe securities settlement system involved. For example, in France, repos are netted with buy-\nsell transactions for settlement. In the United Kingdom, however, the purchase legs of DBV \ntransactions are settled sequentially in a dedicated (DBV-only) settlement window in CREST; \nthe  repurchase  legs  can  settle  at  any  time  the  following  day.  In  other  countries,  eg \nSwitzerland, settlement takes place on the same platform as regular buy-sell transactions but \nthe transactions are initiated at different times (though they might still be settled at the same \ntime depending on settlement delays). \nInstruments and incentives are in place to avoid settlement fails in the purchase leg (and also \nin the repurchase leg) of a repo transaction. Securities lending and borrowing transactions \nare available in all analysed countries. In most markets, intraday credit is provided by the \ncentral banks directly to some or all repo participants. For example, in France and Germany, \nthe CSD provides an automated intraday credit mechanism (\u201cself-collateralisation service\u201d): \nparticipants to the CSD flag the securities eligible to the Eurosystem credit operations as \navailable for self-collateralisation with a specific indicator upon which the CSD can generate \nautomatic intraday credit with the central bank if the cash position of the participant within the \nsystem is insufficient. In the United States, the Federal Reserve provides intraday credit to \nbanks including the two clearing banks, which can then provide intraday credit to their \nparticipants (broker-dealers). In the United Kingdom, the Bank of England provides intraday \ncredit via self-collateralising repos (SCRs) to enable CREST settlement banks to repo their \nSCR-enabled CREST members\u2019 eligible securities in return for sterling liquidity to help the \nsettlement bank fund members\u2019 purchase of those securities.  \nIn addition, breaking down transactions into smaller pieces and introducing more frequent \nsettlement  cycles  reduces  the  number  of  settlement  fails  in  certain  countries.  This  is \ncomplemented by incentives to settle on time, including penalty regimes. For example, in \nCanada,  the  failing  dealer  is  charged  the  target  overnight  repo  rate.  In  Japan,  market \nparticipants have decided to introduce fails charges after an increase in settlement failures \nduring the financial crisis. \nCollateral management and risk management \nAfter initiating the repo, the cash lender owns the securities and both the cash lender and the \ncash borrower must manage the risks arising from the open repo transaction. A tri-party repo \nservice provider and/or a CCP can offer a range of services related to administering the repo \ncontract and managing the collateral, including performing risk management functions on \nbehalf of the participants (eg eligibility checks, valuation, triggering margin calls). \nThe collateral securities received by the cash lender can be held in various ways. In bilateral \nrepos, the securities are transferred from the cash borrower to the cash lender. In tri-party \nrepos, securities are transferred between the cash borrower and the cash lender within the \nsecurities accounts held with the tri-party repo service provider, which acts as agent for the \ncash  lender  and  the  cash  borrower.  If  a  CCP  is  involved  in  the  transaction,  the  CCP \nbecomes the cash lender for the cash borrower and the cash borrower for the cash lender. \nHowever, in most countries the CCP does not hold the securities collateral received from the \ncash borrower but delivers it on to the cash holder. In some larger markets, such as the \nUnited States or the euro area, these different repo arrangements exist alongside each other.  \nRepo counterparties need to manage risks arising during the repo lifetime. For repos based \non collateral baskets, eligibility lists and criteria need to be constantly updated and haircuts \nand margins must be assigned. Once the collateral is transferred, collateral needs to be \nCPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010  29\n  ", " \nmarked to market on a regular basis and margin calls are triggered to ensure adequate \ncollateralisation of exposures. In almost all markets margins and/or haircuts32 are applied. In \nsome  markets,  they  are  specified  bilaterally  between  the  trading  parties.  On  electronic \ntrading platforms, there may be a default haircut and margin. In markets where a CCP is \ninvolved, the CCP effectively standardises the margins and haircuts as it becomes the \ncounterparty to the cash borrower and the cash lender. By contrast, tri-party repo agents \ntypically only implement the haircuts and margins agreed by the counterparties. In some \nspecific  cases,  they  may  review  the  haircuts  and  margins  in  order  to  caution  their \nparticipants, but do not decide on the level of haircuts and margins applied. Other risk \nmanagement instruments frequently used in non-CCP repos include bilateral counterparty \ncredit lines and collateral concentration limits.  \nCollateral substitution \u2013 where provided for in the contract \u2013 allows collateral to be replaced \nduring  the  lifetime  of  a  term  repo.  The  practices  for  substituting  collateral  vary  widely \nbetween markets: first, the European tri-party repo service providers and some euro area \nCSDs  (eg  Clearstream  Banking  Frankfurt  for  Eurex  GC  Pooling  repos)  allow  for  fully \nautomated substitution. Second, in Canada, there is limited substitution, as counterparties \nmust explicitly agree to the ability to substitute at the time of the transaction and then the \nsubstitution can happen on any day. Substitution for term repos with the Bank of Canada is \nonly  allowed  on  specific  days  (twice  each  month).  In  Japan,  collateral  substitution  is \nsupported for repos with the Bank of Japan. Finally, in other markets substitution is achieved \nthrough other means. In the United States, all tri-party and GCF term repos are unwound \neach day and securities are re-allocated to existing term repos and new repos. Also for DVP \nrepos  presented  to  the  CCP  (FICC-GSD),  two  new  netting  instructions  with  the  same \nmaturity date would be entered, with the effect of substituting the collateral in the original \nrepo. In the United Kingdom, although CREST does offer a term repo product, overnight \nDBVs are the dominant form of repo activity in CREST. In order to use DBVs, term repos are \nbroken down into overnight instructions. Hence they are unwound every day and must be re-\nentered,  thereby  providing  an  opportunity  for  substitution.  In  Hong  Kong,  collateral \nsubstitution  is  not  supported,  but  the  borrower  can  repurchase  its  collateral  by  early \ntermination of the repo and generating a new repo for the remainder of the term with different \ncollateral.  \nSome repo markets allow for the re-use of collateral received by the cash lender. The \npossibility for re-use might be unlimited (eg in the case of Swiss tri-party repos) or limited to \nre-use within one or several securities settlement systems (eg in the case of the German \nEurex Repo GC Pooling segment). Collateral re-use is of particular importance for cash \nlenders\u2019  re-financing  needs.  In  Switzerland  and  Germany,  cash  lenders  can  use  repo \ncollateral for re-financing with the central bank. In these two countries, collateral eligibility \ncriteria for the interbank repo market and central bank operations are to a large degree \nidentical, which facilitates refinancing with the central bank.  \nThe possibility for the cash lender to re-use collateral received is to some extent linked to \ncollateral substitution rights. If collateral can be freely re-used by the cash lender (ie also \noutside the securities settlement system), collateral substitution can only be limited or based \nupon the consent of the lender. This is, for example, the case in Switzerland, which allows for \nfree re-use of collateral by the lender, but limits collateral substitution rights. The German \nEurex  Repo  GC  Pooling  segment  allows  for  substitution  but  \u2013  due  to  automation \n                                                 \n32  The application of a haircut leads to a difference between the market value of a security and its collateral \nvalue. Haircuts are taken by the cash lender in order to protect itself from losses arising from declines in the \nmarket value  of the security, should the need  arise to liquidate the collateral.  Margins refer to over-\ncollateralisation of an exposure. Hence, haircuts are expressed as a discount (on collateral value), while \nmargins are expressed as a mark-up (on exposures). \n30  CPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010\n  ", " \nrequirements \u2013 limits re-use of collateral to those securities settlement systems that allow for \nfull information exchange (currently Clearstream Banking Frankfurt and Clearstream Banking \nLuxembourg) and to the central banks that accept the re-use of collateral (currently Deutsche \nBundesbank). \nSettlement of repurchase leg \nUpon termination of the repo, securities collateral is returned to the cash borrower and cash, \nincluding interest, is returned to the cash lender. For the settlement of the repurchase leg, \ncounterparties  rely  on  the  same  payment  and  securities  settlement  systems  as  for  the \npurchase leg.  \nCollateral liquidation (in case of default)  \nIf the cash borrower defaults, the cash lender will need to take possession of the collateral \nand liquidate it to cover its losses or refinance the collateral to obtain liquidity. This requires a \nclear and enforceable legal documentation as well as adequate operational capabilities to \ntake possession of and liquidate a potentially large collateral portfolio. While this might be \nstraightforward  for  larger  banks,  it  might  prove  challenging  for  smaller  and  non-bank \nparticipants. Alternatively, a counterparty might rely on a securities dealer or custodian bank \nto liquidate collateral. Further, financial markets under stress might not be able to absorb \nlarge amounts of collateral liquidated at the same time by various counterparties, which can \nmake liquidation even more difficult and lead to fire sale conditions. If the cash lender holds \ninsufficient collateral, it will attempt to receive the remaining cash amount by other means, \ntypically through the regular bankruptcy proceedings or \u2013 if contractually and legally possible \u2013 \nby netting with other liabilities vis-\u00e0-vis the cash borrower.  \nIf the cash lender defaults, the cash borrower can use the cash to repurchase the collateral \nin the spot market. If the cash borrower has over-collateralised its exposure (eg due to initial \nmargins and/or haircuts), it will attempt to retrieve the surplus collateral. To mitigate the \npotential risk of losing initial margins and/or haircuts, Euroclear Bank offers the separation of \nthe initial margin required by the cash lender on a dedicated separate account in the name of \nEuroclear Bank (via a pledge agreement).  \nSales of securities delivered as collateral take place through regular transactions on the \nsecurities markets and are settled in the respective securities settlement systems. Instead of \nliquidating  immediately,  counterparties  can  decide  to  re-finance  collateral  instead  of \nliquidating  it  immediately.  For  this  purpose,  ready  access  to  funding  liquidity  is  critical. \nCounterparties may also decide to hold the collateral, potentially in combination with hedging \nexposures  against  adverse  price  movements  through  derivative  instruments.  This  could \nstretch the time span and reduce the potential for fire sale conditions.  \nIn the markets analysed for this report, there is no dedicated liquidation facility for repo \ncollateral. Tri-party repo service providers do not take responsibility for collateral liquidation, \nbut  may  facilitate  the  liquidation  of  collateral  by  providing  administrative  support  to  the \nsurviving  counterparty.  If  a  CCP  is  involved  in  the  transaction,  the  CCP  covers  the \ncounterparty risk and protects the remaining counterparty to the repo transaction from any \nlosses. The surviving counterparty would not need to liquidate collateral or to repurchase \ncollateral as the CCP would fulfil its obligation towards the surviving counterparty. As the \nCCP  concentrates  counterparty  risk,  it  might  face  the  liquidation  of  particularly  large \nportfolios. This is compensated by a range of risk-mitigating measures: first, CCPs typically \nask for margins that apply both to the cash lender and the cash borrower side. In addition, \nCCPs usually employ strict collateral eligibility criteria, which should limit market risk in case \nof a default. CCPs also establish penalties and other measures to ensure good settlement \ndiscipline. Finally, CCPs usually have a set of rules and organisational procedures (eg loss \nallocation procedures) in place to manage a participant default. \nCPSS \u2013 Strengthening repo clearing and settlement arrangements \u2013 September 2010  31\n  ", " \nFactors influencing repo clearing and settlement arrangements \nThe array of cross-country differences in repo clearing and settlement arrangements can be \nexplained by several factors, whose particular relevance may differ from country to country: \n\uf0b7  Market  infrastructure  for  buy-sell  transactions:  As  the  repo  clearing  and \nsettlement arrangements rely to a large extent on the infrastructure arrangements \nfor  buy-sell  transactions,  differences  between  these  infrastructures  in  various \ncountries  are  also  reflected  in  the  repo  arrangements.  The  majority  of  the \ndifferences outlined in paragraph 2.15 can, in part, be attributed to differences in the \ninfrastructure for buy-sell transactions. \n\uf0b7  Repo market size and structure: The size of the repo market can influence the \nrepo  clearing  and  settlement  arrangements.  Large  volumes  and  values  create \neconomies  of  scale  and  make  automation  of  some  or  all  processing  steps \neconomically feasible. The number, size and type of repo market participants as well \nas their business needs may also explain differences in repo clearing and settlement \narrangements between countries. In the United States, for example, the use of \nrepos by securities dealers to re-finance their trading portfolio through short-term \nrepos, the size of the repo market, and the rapid turnover generally in the United \nStates government securities market led to the need for daily, efficient access to \ncollateral. From an operational point of view, daily mass unwinds by the clearing \nbanks in the tri-party repo market for collateral substitution purposes was the most \nadequate response.  \n\uf0b7  Capital markets: The depth and liquidity of capital markets, particularly government \nsecurities  markets,  influence  the  availability  of  high-quality  collateral  in  a  repo \nmarket. Where capital markets play less of a role, repo market development might \nbe hampered. However, where the availability of domestic sovereign collateral is \nrestricted, cross-border collateral33 and corporate securities might be accepted as \nan alternative. This can create new or additional infrastructural demands for the \nsettlement of repo transactions using this type of collateral. \n\uf0b7  Access  to  central  bank  services  and  market  infrastructures:  The  extent  to \nwhich repo market participants and/or providers of repo infrastructures have access \nto  central  bank  services  (including  intraday/overnight  credit)  can  also  influence \ncertain aspects of repo clearing and settlement arrangements, such as tiering in \naccess to repo infrastructures.  \n\uf0b7  Use of repo markets by central banks: Many central banks implement monetary \npolicy via repo transactions and are hence active in repo markets. Through this role, \nthey may have an influence on the clearing and settlement arrangements for repo \ntransactions. \n\uf0b7  Other factors: Legal, accounting, and capital treatment of repos may also influence \nthe  development  of  repo  markets  and  the  relevant  market  infrastructure.  For \nexample,  the  accounting  standards  appear  to  be  a  driver  for  CCP  use  in  the \nEuropean Union where repos are on-balance sheet items and netting is subject to \nrestrictive conditions by IFRS standards. This makes the use of a CCP an efficient \ntool for achieving on-balance sheet netting. \n \n                                                 \n33  Collateral is considered to be cross-border if at least one of the following is foreign: the currency of \ndenomination, the jurisdiction in which the assets are located, or the jurisdiction in which the issuer is \nestablished.
