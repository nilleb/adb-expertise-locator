Our central objective is to broadly \nsurvey and analyze the current landscape of the region\u2019s service sector so as to \nassess its potential to serve as an engine for inclusive economic growth. Our \nanalysis  indicates  that  services  are  already  an  important  source  of  output, \ngrowth, and jobs in the region. However, its productivity greatly lags that of the \nadvanced economies, which implies ample room for further growth. The impact \nof service sector on poverty reduction is less clear but we do find some limited \nevidence of a poverty reduction effect. One key challenge for all Asian countries \nis to improve the quality of service sector data. Overall, while service sector \ndevelopment  is  a  long  and  challenging  process,  creating  more  competitive \nservices  markets  by  removing  a  wide  range  of  internal  and  external  policy \ndistortions is vital for improving service sector productivity. As important as such \npolicy reforms are, complementary investments in physical infrastructure and \nhuman capital will also be necessary to achieve a strong service sector. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKeywords: Services, structural change, growth, productivity, Asia \n \nJEL Classification: L8, O14, O40, O47 \n ", " ", "I. INTRODUCTION: WHY DOES DEVELOPING ASIA  \nNEED TO STRENGTHEN ITS SERVICE SECTOR? \n \nAn integral part of the economic growth and development process is structural transformation. \nThe structure of output and employment changes as a country grows and develops. A well-\nknown stylized fact is that the share of agriculture in output and employment falls and the share \nof  manufacturing  and  services  correspondingly  rises  during  the  industrialization  process. \nBeyond  a  certain  point,  as  the  manufacturing  sector  matures,  productivity  growth  in \nmanufacturing offsets employment growth and the employment share of services continues to \nincrease while the employment share of manufacturing begins to decline. In some highly open \ncountries  in  East  and  Southeast  Asia,  comparative  advantage  is  strongly  concentrated  in \nmanufacturing, and the manufacturing share of output itself may peak and decline as the \neconomy eventually rebalances in response to rising income and domestic demand, which has \na larger services component, increases in importance. In many Asian countries, especially in \nEast and Southeast Asia, the industrialization process has gone on for quite some time. In those \ncountries, the scope for further growth of the manufacturing sector is increasingly limited. \n \nWhile export-oriented industrialization has transformed East and Southeast Asia into the \nfactory of the world, the region\u2019s record in the service sector has been much less impressive. \nAsia does have some well-known success stories, such as India\u2019s emergence as the world\u2019s \nleading information and communications technology-business process outsourcing (ICT-BPO) \nexporter (see, for example, Dossani 2010). The Philippines is also emerging as a major ICT-\nBPO hub. However, even in those countries, some tradable service industries rather than the \nentire service sector are performing well. Overall, there is a general perception that in Asia the \nproductivity of a weak service sector lags a strong, internationally competitive manufacturing \nsector. And in some cases, where there are strong service sectors, there are concerns that they \nare effectively enclaves with weak backward and forward linkages to the rest of the economy. \nThis matters considerably for economic growth since low productivity growth in the service \nsector can retard economy-wide productivity growth. The growing tradability of services and \nconsequent emergence of global supply chains in services, for example in health care, presents \nnew growth opportunities for a region which is heavily involved in the global supply chain in \nmanufacturing. \n \nThere are a number of inter-related factors which further strengthen the case for a more \nvibrant Asian service sector at this point in time. For one, while Asia has grown faster than the \nrest of the world for decades, the global financial and economic crisis of 2008\u20132009 has cast a \ndark cloud over its future growth prospects. The crisis originated in the advanced economies \nand hit those economies harder than the developing countries. As a result, the post-crisis \nrecovery has been noticeably weaker in the advanced economies. Furthermore, in the euro \narea, recovery has been dealt another big blow by the ongoing sovereign debt crisis. The \nbottom line is that advanced economies are likely to experience a slowdown relative to the pre-\nglobal crisis period. This has significant adverse ramifications for Asia\u2019s export and growth \nprospects since advanced economies still take in a large share of Asia\u2019s manufactured exports \neven though their share has been declining. At a time when the manufactured exports engine is \nstalling, igniting the services engine can help offset the loss of growth momentum. \n \nTherefore, the global financial crisis has increased the urgency of the rebalancing effort \n(see, for example, ADB 2009).\u00a0\u00a0The global crisis and its pronounced effect on Asia\u2019s exports and \ngrowth shattered any notion that Asia had decoupled from the business cycle of the advanced \neconomies. More fundamentally, it highlighted the risks of disproportionate dependence on \nexports  and  a  corresponding  need  to  strengthen  domestic  demand.  As  a  result  of  strong ", "2   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 320 \n \n \nsustained growth, millions of Chinese, Indians, Indonesians, and other Asians are joining the \nranks of the middle class every year. This implies considerable potential growth for private \nconsumption and domestic demand. Relative to manufactured goods, services tend to be less \ntradable and more geared toward domestic demand.1 Developing the service sector goes hand \nin hand with strengthening domestic demand, especially since services account for much of \nprivate consumption. Service sector development is thus the supply side of the rebalancing \nequation. From a global perspective, advanced economies have a comparative advantage in \nmodern services such as business services. Liberalizing imports of such services can thus \ncontribute not only to the competitiveness of Asian economies but also to global rebalancing. \n \nA dynamic service sector can also contribute to Asia\u2019s quest for inclusive growth which \nincludes broader swathes of the population in the growth process and spreads the fruits of \ngrowth more widely. Education and employment are especially important in reducing inequality \n(see, for example, ADB 2012).\u00a0 In the past, export-oriented industrialization gave Asia the best \nof both worlds\u2014lots of jobs and fast growth. Going forward, however, Asia will find it more \nchallenging to achieve high growth and high employment. While demographic transition toward \nolder populations is already under way in Asia, for the most part Asia is still a relatively young \ncontinent. Hundreds of millions of young job-seeking Asians are joining the workforce every \nyear. Furthermore, as noted, the manufacturing sector is maturing in many parts of Asia so its \ncapacity to create jobs will become more limited. Relative to manufacturing, services tend to be \nlabor intensive. Therefore, service sector growth can make a big contribution to employment \nand thus inclusive growth. \n \n \nII. HETEROGENEITY OF SERVICE SECTOR AND MEASUREMENT PROBLEMS \n \nCompared to agriculture, mining, and most of all, manufacturing, the service sector has long \noccupied a diminished place in both the public imagination and economic research. One reason \nis  the  sheer  diversity  of  the  sector,  encompassing  an  enormous  range  of  industries  and \nactivities which discourage simple mental imagery or easy encapsulation (see Table 1).2 In the \ncase of Asia, the intrinsic heterogeneity of the service sector is compounded by the enormous \nheterogeneity across countries. Asian countries are at very different stages in the development \nlevel of their service sector as well as overall economy. Not surprisingly, this heterogeneity has \nfar-reaching  policy  implications\u2014policy  solutions  for  fostering  the  service  sector  must \nnecessarily  be  country-specific  and  industry-specific.  Heterogeneity  also  entails  profound \nanalytical implications, as explained below. \n \nEichengreen and Gupta (2009) argue that the broad aggregation of services obscures \ntwo distinct \u201cwaves\u201d of service sector growth. The first occurring in \u201ctraditional\u201d service sectors \n(such as personal services) early in the development process at relatively low levels of income \nand the second occurring later in the development process at higher incomes in activities such \nas communication, computer, technical, and business services) that are more intensive in the \nuse of information technology and possess greater scope for cross-border tradability. For some \npurposes, it may be useful to focus on a more limited subset of service activities such as \nbusiness  services  where  the  prospects  for  high-wage  employment  and  cross-border  trade \n                                                 \n1  It is true that technological progress, for example in information and communications technology (ICT), is making \nservices more tradable, but overall services remain less tradable than goods. \n2   Furthermore, the definition of services is not always clear cut. For example, potable water, electricity, and other \npublic utilities are defined to be part of industry rather than services. In many Asian countries, a critical issue in \neconomic development is the lack of access to public utilities.  ", "  Developing the Service Sector as Engine of Growth for Asia: An Overview   \u0406   3 \n \n \nappear relatively high, and political sensitivities may be less acute than in sectors such as \neducation or health. These possibilities may not be inconsiderable: Jensen (2011) points out \nthat in the United States in 1960, business services employed less than half as many workers \ncompared to manufacturing, but by 2007, business services employment was more than double \nmanufacturing. \n \nTable 1: Economic Sectors and their Two digit NAICS Codes \n \nNAICS code  Sector \n11  Agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting \n21  Mining \n22  Utilities \n23  Construction \n31\u201333  Manufacturing \n42  Wholesale trade \n44\u201345  Retail trade \n48\u201349  Transportation and warehousing \n51  Information \n52  Finance and insurance \n53  Real estate and rental and leasing \n54  Professional, scientific, and technical services \n55  Management of companies and enterprises \n56  Administration and support and waste management and remediation  services \n61  Educational services \n62  Health care and social assistance \n71  Arts, entertainment, and recreation \n72  Accommodation and food services \n81  Other services (except public administration) \n92  Public administration \nNAICS = North American Industry Classification System. \nSource: US Census Bureau. http://www.census.gov \n \n \nThe analytical challenges created by the sector\u2019s diversity are compounded by basic \nproblems of measurement. The output of many service sectors is hard to measure (public \neducation, for example). In many countries, many service sector activities are highly regulated, \ninsulated from competition, and subject to administered or otherwise regulated prices (again, \nthink public education). If neither outputs nor quantities are amenable to measurement, it goes \nwithout saying that the assessment of productivity and productivity change is difficult. Needless \nto say, these conditions stand in stark contrast to those prevailing in agriculture, mining, and \nmanufacturing, where output is subject to greater standardization and enormous attention has \nbeen devoted to understanding the determinants of productivity. These analytical challenges are \neven further compounded at the level of the firm, where many of today\u2019s major multinational \ncorporations with their origins in manufacturing such as General Motors or General Electric \nhave large service sector divisions. Indeed, part of the apparent intensification of service sector \nactivity may reflect the changing nature of the firm, specifically outsourcing and off-shoring, with \nthe  latter  also  affecting  the  measurement  of  productivity  in  service-using  sectors  such  as \nmanufacturing (Yuskavage, Strassner, and Medieros 2008; Houseman et al. 2011).  \n \nThese cross-sectoral connections are key. After surveying numerous studies, Francois \nand  Hoekman  (2010)  conclude  that  service  sector  performance  may  be  a  major  factor  in \nproductivity growth economy-wide, and that service sector policy in both its domestic and cross-\nborder manifestations may be a key driver in economic development.  \n ", "4   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 320 \n \n \nIII. SERVICE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT AND PER CAPITA INCOME:  \nSOME KEY STYLIZED FACTS \n \nEconomists have a troubling tendency to look for lost keys under the lamppost and these \nanalytical challenges may have contributed to the understudy of the service sector relative to \nothers. If this underemphasis was ever justified, the growth of the service sector relative to other \nparts of the economy makes it untenable today. Services output is positively correlated with per \ncapita  income  and  employment  shares  cross-sectionally  at  the  global  level  as  shown  in \nFigures 1 and 2, respectively.

The World Factbook; World Bank. World Development Indicators online database (both \naccessed 24 February 2012). \n \n \nEichengreen and Gupta argue that the service sector of output rises at a decelerating \nrate until it levels out at around $1,800 per capita (2000 purchasing power adjusted dollars) and \nthen accelerates again at about $4,000 per capita before leveling off again. It also appears that \nthe per capita income threshold for the second takeoff appears to have declined since around \n1990, presumably reflecting the diffusion and increased applicability of information technology. \nEducational  attainment  is  connected  to  the  capacity  to  successfully  adapt  to  the  local \nenvironment innovations originating abroad. The second wave appears to be more acute in \ndemocracies, in countries near major financial sectors, and economies relatively open to trade. \nTo this list, one could presumably append educational attainment. These tendencies suggest a \nprocess in which cross-border trade and investment are an important diffusion mechanism with \ndemocracies being more open to information technology, possibly placing a greater emphasis \non education, and carrying a lower foreign investment risk premium. Globally cross-border trade \nin services has risen steadily as a share of world income for the past quarter century (see \nFigure 4).  \n \n \n   ", "6   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 320 \n \n \nFigure 4: Global Trade in Services as Share of World GDP \n \n%\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n1975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009\n \nSource: World Bank, World Development Indicators online database (accessed 24 February 2012). \n \n \nFigures 5 and 6 present data of selected Asian countries on the service sector\u2019s share of \nnational income and employment, respectively.

Although it is true \nthat global services trade has risen over time relative to national income, the pattern in Asia is \nless clear (Figure 7). This outcome may partly be due to the policy impediments to cross-border \nexchange such as national regulations block or impede foreign service providers from gaining a \nfoothold in national markets. \n \n \nFigure 7: Trade in Services as % of GDP  \n \nSingapore Hong Kong, China Malaysia\nKorea, Rep. of Philippines Pakistan\n%\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of\n100\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n1972 1976 1980 1984 1988 1992 1996 2000 2004 2008\n \nSource: World Bank, World Development Indicators online database (accessed 24 February 2012). ", "8   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 320 \n \n \nTrade in services has been dealt with unevenly at the multilateral, regional, and bilateral \nlevels. The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) identifies four modalities: trade in \nservices where physical interaction between the buyer and seller is unnecessary, analogous to \ntrade in goods; consumption abroad where the consumer travels to the provider (i.e., tourism); \ncommercial  presence  where  the  provider  establishes  a  facility  in  the  client\u2019s  country  (i.e., \ninvestment); and temporary movement of service providers to the client (i.e., migration). These \ndifferent modalities involve differing issues and complicate negotiations; the process is further \ncomplicated by the fact that countries have differing comparative advantages and interests in \nliberalization across the range of service activities associated with differing modes of delivery.  \n \nServices trade policy restrictiveness tends to decline with per capita income (Figure 8). \nPresumably, causality runs in both directions: More open economies tend to grow faster and get \nrich, while for political economy reasons, rich economies with large service sectors tend not to \nimpose restrictions on these important and politically influential industries. However, differential \nperformance with respect to services imports and exports (Figures 9 and 10, respectively) \nsuggests that the competitiveness of Asian service providers may also be an issue.  \n \n \nFigure 8: Trade Restrictiveness and per Capita Income \n \nDeveloping Asia Developing Europe\nLatin America and Caribbean Middle East and North Africa\nSub-Saharan Africa High-income economies\n80\nIn\nd\ne\nx\n o\nIND f re\n60 s\nPHI tric\ntiv\nINO e\nBAN THA MAL  p\no\nNEPVIE 40 lic\nSRI y o\nPRC n s\nPAK e\nrv\nCAM KOR ic\nUZB 20 es\nKGZMON KAZ  tra\nGEO d\ne\nARM\n0\n0 10 20 30 40 50\nGross domestic product per capita (2005 constant purchasing power parity $\u2019000)\n \nARM = Armenia; BAN = Bangladesh; CAM = Cambodia; GEO = Georgia; IND = India; INO = Indonesia; KAZ = Kazakhstan;  \nKOR = Republic of Korea; KGZ = Kyrgyz Republic; MAL = Malaysia; MON = Mongolia; NEP = Nepal; PAK = Pakistan;  \nPHI = Philippines; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China; SRI = Sri Lanka; THA = Thailand=; UZB = Uzbekistan. \nNote: Data on restrictiveness of policy on services trade are from 2008 to 2011, and on gross domestic product in 2010. \nSources: Borchert, Gootiz, and Mattoo (2012); World Bank.

SERVICE SECTOR IN ASIA: THE BASIC FACTS \n \nAcross the region, the service sector has clearly been on the rise, whether viewed in \nterms of output or employment. From about 44% average share in 1980, the service sector \nnow accounts for slightly over one-half of GDP in developing Asia, but there is some variation \nacross the subregions (Figure 11).3 In East Asia, the service sector comprises about 60% of \nGDP, and the current high share is mainly due to the newly industrializing economies (NIEs)\u2014\nHong Kong, China; the Republic of Korea; and Taipei,China\u2014with services shares of about \n60%\u201390% (Figure 12). But the PRC has also witnessed a significant rise in services, by roughly \n20 percentage points over the past 3 decades. Compared to other subregions, the service \nsector has been less dynamic in Southeast Asia; only Philippines and Singapore have services \nshares, rising to over one-half of GDP. A uniform pattern of rapidly growing service sector can \nbe seen across South Asia, most notably in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, where services shares \nhave risen by about 15\u201320 percentage points. In Central Asia, the surge of the service sector \nhas been quite dramatic, as economies\u2019 newly gained independence in the 1990s resulted in \nthe rise of new service activities. Owing to their geographic conditions and significant tourism \nsector, most Pacific countries have maintained large service sectors.  \n \nFigure 11: Sector Shares of GDP by Subregion \n \nAgriculture Industry Services\nDeveloping\u00a0Asia 122900901000\nCentral\u00a0Asia 122900901000\n1990\nEast\u00a0Asia 22000100\n1990\nouth\u00a0Asia 22000100\nS\nSoutheast\u00a0Asia 122900901000\nThe\u00a0Pacific 122900901000\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n%  \nNote: Countries covered are those with data around 1990, 2000, and 2010.

Majority of the employed \nare now in services in several economies, including Kazakhstan, Malaysia, the Maldives, the \nPhilippines, and the NIEs (Figure 13). In 1990, only Singapore and Hong Kong, China had \nservice employment shares of over one-half, while in the PRC, Cambodia, and Viet Nam, less \nthan 20% were employed in services.

In the past 10 years, the service sector accounted \nfor more than one-half of GDP growth in most economies in the region (Figure 14). Even during \nthe 1990s, a period of more subdued growth for the region, the service sector contributed to \nmost of the growth.

In India, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka, roughly over 60% of the growth in 2000\u20132010 \nwas due to services. In Southeast Asia, the service sector contributed to over one-half of the \ngrowth in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore. But in East Asia, particularly the \nPRC; the Republic of Korea; and Taipei,China, the story is still industry rather than services, \ndriving overall growth. As noted in ADB (2007), the service sector has played an important role \nin countries where the pace of industrialization has been slow such as in the case of South \nAsian countries and the Philippines.

LOW PRODUCTIVITY OF ASIA\u2019S SERVICE SECTOR \n \nAlthough the service sector has been rapidly rising across economies in the region, the sector \ncontinues to be dominated by traditional activities. As in the past, traditional services comprising \nwholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants, real estate, transport, personal services, and \npublic administration, continue to predominate (Table 2). At the other end are modern services \nwhich include information and communication, finance, and professional business services; they \ncomprise only about 8%\u201312% of the economy in the PRC, India, Indonesia, Thailand, and \nTaipei,China,  but  in  advanced  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development \n(OECD) economies such as France, Japan, and the US, they account for about 17%\u201325%. Only \nHong Kong, China; the Republic of Korea; and Singapore have sizes of modern services that \nare  comparable  with  the  OECD.

But for \nmost economies, crude estimates based on an average growth in productivity for developing \nAsia, at 4% in 2000\u20132009, indicate that it might take about 15\u201330 years to reach even about \none-fifth of the OECD\u2019s current labor services productivity. Using the PRC and India\u2019s historical \ngrowth for services productivity, it will take only about 10 years for the two countries; their \nproductivity growth rates, at around 8%, are much higher than in other countries. Meanwhile, \nthere are countries where services productivity levels have barely moved in the past decade. \nFor example, while the Republic of Korea\u2019s productivity level is already 40% that of OECD, labor \nproductivity growth has only been less than 1%, and according to some estimates, total factor \nproductivity growth has actually been negative (Schiff 2007, Hyundai Research Institute 2010). \nSimilarly for Thailand, labor services productivity has been stagnant.

On a positive \nnote, this implies that there is plenty of room for productivity growth in services and thus for \nservices to contribute to Asia\u2019s future economic growth. While a major shift toward a larger \nservice sector has occurred in most economies in the region, not so much has changed in terms \nof the composition of services. Gauging by the pace by which the mix of service activities has \nevolved, the process of achieving a more sophisticated and modern service sector is more likely \nto entail a long process. Asian economies can either wait for the process to take hold or initiate \nbold  steps  to  hasten  the  process.  And  while  moving  toward  modern  and  high-productivity \nservices is a desirable path for economies trapped in traditional and low-productivity services, \nfor the poor an immediate concern is that services should act as a direct instrument in bringing \nabout a more inclusive growth, an issue we explore in the next section. \n \nGoing forward, fostering productivity growth in services will require tackling both \ninternal and external distortions. Liberalizing trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) in \nservices can promote productivity and efficiency for the same reasons as goods trade and FDI. \nOne specific channel is via imports of modern business services from the advanced economies. \nHowever, in order to ensure productivity growth of the service sector as a whole rather than a \nfew high-productivity enclaves, it is vital to remove domestic distortions such as excessive \nregulation. A more competitive market environment resulting from the removal of internal and \nexternal distortions holds the key to lifting productivity growth.  ", "22   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 320 \n \n \nA more productive service sector has positive spillover effect on manufacturing \nand  the  rest  of  the  economy.  For  example,  efficient  information  and  communications \ntechnology (ICT) and transportation can promote productivity across the entire economy. A \nstrong modern service sector, in particular business services such as design, prototyping, and \nmarketing can help middle income Asian countries move up the value chain and thus escape \nthe much-feared middle income trap.  \n \nThe government can help lay the foundation for a vibrant service sector through both \npolicy reform and investments in physical infrastructure and human capital. As evident in the \nrise of India\u2019s ICT-BPO sector due to lack of regulation and the PRC\u2019s stunted service sector \ndue to pro-manufacturing policy bias, removing policy distortions can help. The experience of \nboth the PRC and India show that policy distortions can stunt the growth of the service sector. \nAt the same time, the government can take active measures to create a more conducive \nenvironment for the service sector\u2014e.g., investing in physical infrastructure such as telecom \nand education/human capital. Good infrastructure and adequate supply of human capital are \nespecially important for the modern service industries such as the ICT-BPO industry. \n \n \nVI. ASIA\u2019S SERVICE SECTOR HAS SOME EFFECT ON POVERTY REDUCTION  \nAND THUS INCLUSIVE GROWTH \n \nServices growth is correlated with poverty reduction (Box 1 and Figure 22). The question \nis whether one can say anything more definitive. Once the initial level of poverty is taken into \naccount,  one  can  think  of  a  number  of  variables  related  to  economic  performance  and \ninstitutional characteristics that might affect poverty alleviation. In the former category, structural \nfactors such as the differential growth of the agricultural, industrial, and service sectors, or the \ngrowth of public consumption are obvious possibilities. High levels of physical and human \ncapital accumulation, in the latter case particularly with respect to women, may be associated \nwith rapid and inclusive growth. There is also some evidence that land-scarce countries may \nhave somewhat distinct developmental trajectories and this profile may be particularly amenable \nto growth with equity (Leamer 1987). \n \n \n \n   ", "  Developing the Service Sector as Engine of Growth for Asia: An Overview   \u0406   23 \n \n \nFigure 22: Change in Poverty and Annual Growth in Services Output, 1990\u20132010 \n \nDeveloping Asia Rest of the world\n20\nC\nh\na\nn\ng\ne\nMAL 0  in p\no\nv\nSRI e\nTHPAHI KGZ ARM rty h\nIND AZE ea\n-20 dc\nLAO o\nCAM un\nBAN t (p\ne\nrc\nINO en\n-40 ta\ng\nNEP PAK VITEAJ PRC e po\nin\nts\n)\n-60\n-5.0 0.0 5.0 10.0\nGrowth in services output (%)\n \nARM = Armenia; AZE = Azerbaijan; BAN = Bangladesh; CAM = Cambodia; IND = India; INO = Indonesia; KGZ = Kyrgyz; Republic; \nLAO = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; MAL = Malaysia; NEP = Nepal; PAK = Pakistan; PHI = Philippines;  \nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China; SRI = Sri Lanka; TAJ = Tajikistan; THA = Thailand; VIE = Viet Nam. \nSource: Authors' estimates based on data from  World Bank, World Development Indicators online database (accessed 16 April \n2012). \n \nInstitutionally, there is some evidence that democracies tend to have more inclusive \ngrowth (though the direction of causality is debatable), and it would not be surprising if there \nwere long-lasting legacy effects embedded in formerly  centrally planned economies (CPE) \n(Perotti 1996). \n \nHowever, the problem that immediately arises is that these characteristics are highly \ncorrelated, and this high degree of collinearity may frustrate the precise identification of the \ncausal channels of these effects. As shown in Table 3, the reduction in poverty is not only highly \ncorrelated with the initial level of poverty and the subsequent growth of the service sector, but \nmany  other  variables  as  well.  Apart  from  its  initial  level,  the  three  variables  most  highly \ncorrelated with change in poverty levels are the urban population share (surprisingly associated \nwith a slower reduction in poverty), being an Asian developing country, and the growth of \nservices output, both associated with more rapid poverty reduction.

The form of the model follows the commonly used convergence growth \nmodel  in  which,  conditional  on  the  starting  level  value  of  the  dependent  variable,  the \ndeterminants of the rapidity of its change are estimated. This approach to the analysis of \npoverty reduction has been previously explored for a shorter period, 1990\u20132005, by Ghani and \nKharas (2010). This is but one indicator of inclusive growth; one can think of others, such as the \nlevel of employment, or employment by particular, traditionally disadvantaged groups, such as \nwomen. These regressions are reported in Table 4. \n \nControlling for initial poverty, poverty change is regressed against growth in services, \nagricultural, and manufacturing outputs. We also explored a number of other potential drivers of \npoverty reduction: educational attainment, particularly female educational attainment; Polity IV \ndemocracy scores (per Kuznets a reduction in inequality with rising per capita income may \nreflect a greater weight put on poverty reduction due to democratization), physical investment; \ngovernment consumption; urbanization; and the abundance of arable land (there is evidence \nthat  land-scarce  countries  may  have  unique  development  paths  distinctively  amenable  to \ninclusive growth); due to their distinct institutional organization, status as former CPEs; status as \na developing Asia country, as well as sample period.  \n \nIn this multivariate framework, most of the potential regressors were found not to be \nrobustly correlated with poverty reduction. As expected, initial poverty is consistently correlated \nwith poverty reduction, indicating that countries with higher poverty rates tend to have faster \nrates of poverty reduction. Results of the basic model (specification 1 in Table 4) indicate that \nchange in poverty is negatively related to growth in services output, i.e., growth in services \noutput  growth  is  significantly  associated  with  poverty  reduction.  Neither  agricultural  nor \nmanufacturing output growth is significant in the model. Additionally, former CPEs exhibit more \nrapid rates of poverty reduction. The results are broadly in line with the results of Ghani and \nKharas. In specification 2, the share of females attending secondary school or higher at the \nbeginning of the sample period is included. Female education is significantly associated with \npoverty reduction. Service output growth, initial poverty, and status as a former CPE remain \nsignificant. In specification 3, we remove the former CPE variable as well as the insignificant \nmanufacturing and agricultural growth variables. In their place, we introduce a developing Asia \nbinary variable. To be clear, it is not theoretically obvious why specific regions of the world \nshould exhibit distinctive results.

As  a  consequence  of \ncollinearity between female education and the polity score, the estimated coefficients on these \nvariables are not statistically significant, though they are jointly significant at the 90% confidence \nlevel. In specification 6, the former CPE dummy is replaced with the developing Asia dummy. As \nwith specification 4, developing Asia absorbs sufficient sample variation to render the service \noutput, female education, and polity score coefficients insignificant. Jointly, the three variables \nare significant at the 95% confidence level. Similarly, female education and service production \nare jointly significant at the 90% confidence level. In short, it appears that female educational \nattainment,  services  output,  and  the  democracy  indicator  are  all  correlated  with  poverty \nreduction, but teasing out the precise relationship is hampered by multicollinearity.  \n \nIn  specifications  7  through  9,  the  female  education  variable  is  dropped  while  the \ndemocracy variable is retained. Specification 7 uses the former CPE control and produces \nsignificant results for all included variables with polity score indicating a significant correlation \nwith poverty reduction. Specification 8 includes the developing Asia dummy without the former \nCPE  variable.  The  results  from  equations  4  and  6  are  repeated  as  the  inclusion  of  the \ndeveloping Asia dummy renders the coefficients on the services and polity score variables \ninsignificant. Finally, specification 9 includes the former CPE and developing Asia controls \njointly along with the polity score variable. Unlike specification 4 in which the coefficient on \nstatus as a former CPE was insignificant, in specification 9, the estimated coefficients on both \nthe former CPE and developing Asia dummies are significant. A country\u2019s polity score is also \nsignificantly  correlated  with  poverty  reduction  in  this  specification.  Services  output  growth, \nhowever, is not significant in this case.  \n \nIn sum, visual inspection of the data along the lines of Figure 22 confirm that services \noutput is associated with inclusive growth. The simple correlations reported in Table 3 show that \nthe growth of services output is the structural characteristic more highly correlated with the \nreduction  of  poverty.  The  high  degree  of  multicollinearity  among  the  variables  of  interest \nfrustrate identifying the precise causal channels, but the multivariate regressions reported in \nTable 4 establish that while there is evidence that services growth is associated with poverty \nreduction, the relationship does not appear to be robust. What can be said definitively is that \nthere is no evidence that growth of services output is associated with worsening poverty. \n\u00a0\nVII. SERVICES, GENDER EQUALITY, AND ENVIRONMENTALLY  \nSUSTAINABLE GROWTH \n \nIn addition to poverty reduction, greater gender equality is another key dimension of more \ninclusive growth. In particular, expanding access to education and employment opportunities \nholds the key to including women in the growth process and spreading the fruits of growth to \nwomen. Asian countries are recently paying more attention to the environmental costs of rapid \ngrowth and developing the service sector can contribute to more environmentally sustainable \ngrowth. \n \nA.  Services and Gender Equality \n \nIntuitively, as an economy evolves from agriculture to manufacturing and services, service \nsector growth should be more conducive for female employment since services jobs tend to be \nless physically demanding than manufacturing jobs. Development of the service sector can \nwiden employment opportunities for both men and women, but especially so for women. Indeed ", "28   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 320 \n \n \nthe World Development Report (World Bank 2012) shows that across 77 countries, services \naccounts for a higher proportion of female employment than male employment, and the reverse \nis true for manufacturing.  \n \nGhani (2010) supports the view that the growth of services is key to female employment. \nHe finds that countries where services account for a higher share of employment have higher \nfemale labor force participation rates. In India and Pakistan, the service sector experienced the \nlargest growth in female labor force participation over the past three decades. Furthermore, a \nthriving modern service sector in India opened up huge employment opportunities for women. \nWomen account for 30% of the information technology (IT) services and information technology \nenabled services (ITES) workforce in India, which is higher than female share of services \nemployment. But while advances in information and communication technologies can open up \nnew job possibilities for women, they can also entail female job insecurity and gender wage \ndisparities rooted in gender gaps in access to education and acquisition of skills. Addressing \nsuch gaps will be crucial in enhancing the potential of the service sector in reducing gender \ndisparities in the labor market. \n \nB.  Services and Environmentally Sustainable Growth \n \nAs noted earlier, as countries grow richer, the relative importance of services in the economy \ntends to rise. In addition, the general public tends to demand a cleaner environment in richer \ncountries, which consequently invest more in protecting the environment. The two stylized \nfacts\u2014cleaner environment and services-oriented economy\u2014may not be independent of each \nother. Relative to agriculture and manufacturing, the service sector tends to be less resource-\nintensive and thus places less strain on the environment. For example, food and beverage \nmanufacturing  uses  resource  inputs  such  as  agricultural  products,  land,  water,  fuel,  and \nelectricity, in addition to labor input. In contrast, an IT firm is highly dependent only on labor and \nelectricity. Furthermore, IT exports can be sent through the internet and so will require less \ntransport and energy costs than manufacturing exports. \n \nThe relationship between services and environment can also be analyzed in terms of the \npotential impact of certain environmental risks on services. For example, climate change will \naffect the availability of resources, but its impact will be less serious for the service sector \ncompared to its impact on the agricultural and industrial sectors. Still, there are service sector \nactivities such as tourism, transport, and telecommunications which can be adversely affected \nby severe changes in the environment (World Resources Institute and International Finance \nCorporation 2009). But overall, considering the relatively low resource-intensity of services, \nenvironmental changes are expected to have less direct impact on services compared to other \nsectors. This suggests that resource degradation and depletion will pose a bigger constraint to \nthe  expansion  of  output  in  agriculture  and  manufacturing  sectors  than  in  services.  Going \nforward, it may be less environmentally costly to expand services than other sectors. \n \n \nVIII. SERVICES, URBANIZATION, AND INFORMALITY \n \nAsian economies are increasingly becoming more urbanized. Several cities in the region such \nas New Delhi, Seoul, and Shanghai are among the largest megacities in the world. Urbanization \ncan  be  viewed  as  a  natural  consequence  of  economic  growth.  For  the  service  sector, \nurbanization can be a major driver of the sector\u2019s growth. At the same time, urbanization, \nespecially at the early stages, tends to generate more informal sector activities which in turn are \nalso associated with the service sector.  ", "  Developing the Service Sector as Engine of Growth for Asia: An Overview   \u0406   29 \n \n \nA.  Urbanization and Service Sector  \n \nRising urbanization is associated with higher income which in turn raises the demand for a wide \narray of services. Thus, both traditional and modern services thrive in urban locations. There is \na tendency for service sector industries to locate in urban areas to enable proximity to both \nclients and suppliers. Face-to-face interaction with clients is important for many service sector \nindustries such as retailing, education, health, and other community and personal services, so \nthe presence of a large concentration of people in urban locations is ideal for the service sector. \nService sector industries also often cater to varying business activities, so they will locate in \nareas with dense and diverse business settings (Kolko 2010). The evidence for Asia indicates \nthat more urbanized economies have larger services output and employment shares (Figures \n23 and 24). The rapid urbanization of Asian economies is therefore another reason to expect \nthat services will become more important as a source of growth and jobs. \n \n \n \nFigure 23: Urbanization Rate and Share of Services in GDP, Developing Asia,  \n2009 (%) \n \n100\nHKG\nMLD\n80\nS\nFIJ TAP SIN ha\nre\nGEO  o\nTON KIR KOR f s\ne\nSRI SAM 60 rv\nSOL IND PHI ic\nNEP BATNAJ KGZPAK KAZ es in\nAFG UZB MON MAL  G\nTHA ARM D\nPRC P\nCAM\nVIELAOBHU INO 40\nMYA TKM\nAZE\nPNG\n20\n20 40 60 80 100\nUrbanization rate\n \nAFG = Afghanistan; ARM = Armenia; AZE = Azerbaijan; BAN = Bangladesh; BHU = Bhutan; CAM = Cambodia; FIJ = Fiji;  \nGEO = Georgia; HKG = Hong Kong, China; IND = India; INO = Indonesia; KAZ = Kazakhstan; KIR = Kiribati; KOR = Korea, Rep. of; \nKGZ = Kyrgyz Republic; LAO = Lao PDR; MAL = Malaysia; MLD = Maldives; MON = Mongolia; MYA = Myanmar; NEP = Nepal; \nPAK = Pakistan; PHI = Philippines; PNG = Papua New Guinea; PRC = China, People's Rep. of; SAM = Samoa; SIN = Singapore; \nSOL = Solomon Islands; SRI = Sri Lanka; TAP = Taipei,China; TAJ = Tajikistan; THA = Thailand; TON = Tonga;  \nTKM = Turkmenistan; UZB = Uzbekistan; VIE = Viet Nam. \n \n \n   ", "30   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 320 \n \n \nFigure 24: Urbanization Rate and Share of Services in Employment, Developing Asia, \n2009 (%) \n \n100\nHKG\nKOR 80 S\nSIN h\na\nre\n o\nf s\ne\nMLD MAL rvic\n60 e\ns\nTAP  in\nKAZ PHI  em\nAZE p\nKGZ MON loy\nSRI INO ARM 40 ment\nTHA PAKPRC\nBAN GEO\nCAM BHU\nIND\nVIE\n20\n20 40 60 80 100\nUrbanization rate\n \nARM = Armenia; AZE = Azerbaijan; BAN = Bangladesh; BHU = Bhutan; CAM = Cambodia; GEO = Georgia; HKG = Hong Kong; \nChina; IND = India; INO = Indonesia; KAZ = Kazakhstan; KOR = Republic of Korea; KGZ = Kyrgyz; Republic; MAL = Malaysia;  \nMLD = Maldives; MON = Mongolia; PAK = Pakistan; PHI = Philippines; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China; SIN = Singapore;  \nSRI = Sri Lanka; TAP = Taipei,China; THA = Thailand; VIE = Viet Nam. \nNote: Employment data refer to 2006 for Cambodia and the Maldives; 2007 for Georgia; 2008 for Armenia, the Kyrgyz Republic, and \nPakistan; and 2010 for Bangladesh and India. \nSources: CEIC Data Company; World Bank. World Development Indicators online database (both accessed 16 April 2012). \n \n \nIX. URBANIZATION AND INFORMAL SECTOR EMPLOYMENT \n \nThe informal sector is a large part of the economy in many Asian countries. As share of \nnonagricultural employment, the informal sector accounts for over 60% in Cambodia, India, \nIndonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam (Figure 25). Since the informal sector is often \ndominated by the service sector, this provides another reason to suspect that services are a \nlarge part of output and employment. \n \n \n   ", "  Developing the Service Sector as Engine of Growth for Asia: An Overview   \u0406   31 \n \n \nFigure 25: Share of Informal Sector in Non-agricultural Employment \n \n%\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\nAZE THA ARM KYR INO SRI CAM VIE PAK IND  \nARM = Armenia; AZE = Azerbaijan; CAM = Cambodia; IND = India; INO = Indonesia; KYR = Kyrgyz Republic; PAK = Pakistan;  \nSRI = Sri Lanka; THA = Thailand; VIE = Viet Nam. \nSources: International Labour Organization (2011),  Key Indicators of the Labour Market, 7th edition; Asian Development Bank \n(2005),  Key Indicators.   \n \n \nOne factor which may well drive the link between services and the informal sector is the \nimportance of both in providing jobs in urban areas, especially in low-income economies or at \nthe early stages of urbanization. Many urban migrants settle for informal sector work because \ntheir low skills and limited education constitute a major barrier in finding jobs in the formal \nsector. It is easier for poor urban migrants to find work in simple service sector jobs such as \nstreet vendor, peddler, and small shop assistant, unlike in manufacturing where a minimum \nlevel of skill is required to become a machine operator or a worker in the production line. At \nsubstantially high income levels though, the importance of informal sector diminishes (ADB \n2005), while that of service sector in general rises even more. \n \n \nX. QUALITY OF DATA: A MAJOR PROBLEM IN THE ANALYSIS OF ASIAN SERVICES \n \nIt would be desirable to focus the discussion on a more narrowly defined range of services \nrelatively suitable to liberalization and clear economic linkage to the performance of the rest of \nthe economy such as \u201cbusiness services.\u201d What one immediately confronts, however, is the \ndearth of data. Indeed, one of the central messages of this study is the need to greatly expand \nefforts at basic data collection\u2014one cannot manage what one cannot measure. This is an \nactivity that the Asian Development Bank is ideally positioned to support.  \n \nTable 5 summarizes data available for developing Asian economies, based on a survey \nof the countries\u2019 bureaus of statistics and labor. It may well be incomplete and we would \nwelcome identification of missing sources. Nevertheless, even interpreted as an incomplete first \npass, it is cautioning. There is a tendency for occupational employment and wage data to be \navailable at finer levels of disaggregation than sectoral output or value-added data which in turn \nis reported with greater granularity than the international transactions data. This unevenness \nappears to be at least in part a function of bureaucratic tasking, with labor ministries tending to ", "32   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 320 \n \n \ntake the lead on employment data, economics or industry ministries the output data, and the \nfinance ministry or central bank the international transactions data.

SOME CONCEPTUAL ISSUES \n \nIn  this  section,  we  explore  a  couple  of  conceptual  issues  pertaining  to  service  sector \ndevelopment in Asia. First, we explore the relative role of manufacturing and services in the \ngrowth and development in Asian countries. Second, we examine the links between services \nproductivity and productivity in other sectors of the economy, especially industry. Finally, we \ntake a quick look at the potential contribution of service sector development to inclusive growth \nin Asia, along with the role of Asian governments in fostering more dynamic service sectors. \n \nA.  The Either-Manufacturing-or-Services Fallacy \n \nSome  Asian  countries,  most  notably  India,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  the  Philippines,  have \nsucceeded in leveraging ICT and other new technologies to boost services exports and growth. \nSome point to the experiences of those countries as evidence that services-led growth offers a \nviable alternative growth and development strategy to the traditional manufacturing-led growth. \nAccording  to  this  line  of  reasoning,  technological  progress  allows  countries  to  leapfrog \nindustrialization and move straight into the post-industrial phase. Regardless of the validity of \nthe  leapfrogging  hypothesis\u2014and  clearly  there  are  alternative  pathways  to  development\u2014\nframing growth and development strategy as a matter of either manufacturing or services is a \ndangerous fallacy (Leamer 1987).\u00a0The leapfrogging hypothesis is dangerous because it can be \nmisused as an excuse for the failures of the manufacturing sector. It is no accident that the \nadvocates of leapfrogging tend to highlight countries which have failed to develop a strong \nmanufacturing sector\u2014e.g., the Philippines. While India has often been hailed as the poster \nchild of services-led growth, in fact the manufacturing sector has grown rapidly and contributed \nsignificantly to growth. Although we should not downplay the ICT-BPO industry\u2019s contributions, \nthe industry\u2019s output and employment are nowhere near enough to carry India\u2019s growth on its \nown. \n \nUpon closer reflection, framing Asian countries\u2019 growth and development strategy in \nterms of either manufacturing or services is not very meaningful because it is necessary for a \ncountry to have both manufacturing and service sectors. Indeed while the relative importance of \nthe two sectors evolve over time, they both account for a large share of output and employment \nin most countries in Asia and elsewhere, and development is likely to be maximized when they \nmove forward together symbiotically. The real challenge for Asian countries is to address the \nstructural and policy impediments which stand in the way of efficient manufacturing and service \nsectors. For example, in the case of India, augmenting the quantity and quality of its subpar \nphysical infrastructure will boost the productivity of its manufacturing sector. \n \nIn countries where the industrialization process has not run its course\u2014and most of Asia \nfalls in this category\u2014the productivity of the manufacturing sector remains low. This implies that \nthe sector will remain a key driver of growth and jobs for years to come, especially under a \nsound institutional and policy environment. It is more fruitful to look at comparative advantage \nfrom a dynamic perspective. While it is tempting to write off the industrialization prospects of, \nsay, the Philippines, we should remember that comparative advantage evolves over time. In \naddition, both services and manufacturing are far from monolithic and include a wide, diverse ", "  Developing the Service Sector as Engine of Growth for Asia: An Overview   \u0406   35 \n \n \nrange of industries. Therefore, there are likely to be some industries in both sectors where a \ncountry  may  have  a  comparative  advantage.  While  ICT and  other new  technologies have \nopened  up  a  lot  of  new  possibilities  for  the  service  sector,  especially  by  improving  their \ntradability, a good balance between services and manufacturing remains the most viable growth \nstrategy for Asian countries. \n \nB.  Synergies Between Services and Industrial Productivity \n \nThe service sector plays an important role in raising the productivity of the manufacturing sector \nand other sectors of the economy. This particularly applies to business services, as they provide \nkey intermediate inputs such as finance, legal services, human resource recruitment, marketing, \nand information technology to manufacturing and other sectors. Rather than handling tasks \nrelated to business services internally, manufacturing firms may find it more cost-efficient to \noutsource these tasks to firms that specialize in them. Increasing fragmentation of business \nprocesses and the corresponding growth of the global business process outsourcing industry \nindicate how outsourcing, including offshoring, of service functions has become an integral part \nof running a viable and competitive business. By unloading some tasks to specialized service \nproviders, manufacturing companies can concentrate on their core activities, and on improving \nproduction and undertaking innovation and technological upgrade. The important synergies \nbetween services and industry become more apparent as economies develop, produce more \ndifferentiated  goods,  and  require  more  efficient  systems  for  businesses.  As  a  very  rough \nmeasure of synergies between services and industry, we take a look at the correlation between \nlabor productivity in the two sectors. Figure 26 reveals that there is a high degree of correlation \nbetween  services  productivity  and  industrial  productivity.  While  the  correlation  is  likely  to \nprimarily  reflect  factors  which  affect  labor  productivity  of  both  industry  and  services\u2014e.g., \nhuman capital and physical infrastructure\u2014the strength of the correlation suggests the presence \nof at least some synergies between labor productivity in the two sectors as well.  \n \n \nFigure 26: Correlation of Productivity in Services and Industry, Late 2000s \n(2000 constant $) \nDeveloping Asia Rest of the world\n120,000\n90,000\nS\ne\nrvice\n60,000 s p\nro\nd\nu\nc\ntiv\nity\n30,000\n0\n0 20,000 40,000 60,000 80,000 100,000 120,000 140,000\nIndustry productivity\n \nNote: Data from 2005 to 2010. \nSource: World Bank, World Development Indicators online data base (accessed 16 April 2012). ", "36   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 320 \n \n \nA limited set of studies have examined the links between the service sector and other \nsectors. The studies broadly indicate the critical role of the service sector in lifting economy-\nwide productivity. Francois and Hoekman (2010) have surveyed some studies that explore the \nimpact of the service sector on the rest of the economy. They cite studies that indicate the \nimportance of services in raising aggregate productivity, as well as in explaining differences in \naggregate productivity levels and growth rates across countries. A study by Pilat and W\u00f6lfl \n(2005)  indicates  how  services  provide  key  contributions  to  production,  through  its  direct \ncontribution to total output and final demand, as well as through provision of intermediate inputs. \nFurther, the growing interdependence between services and manufacturing is seen in the rising \namount of service sector value added being embodied in manufacturing goods. The relationship \nbetween service sector size and productivity and living standards is examined in a study by \nEichengreen  and  Gupta  (2009).  They  find  a  positive  correlation  between  output  share  of \nservices and income per capita, but such a relationship holds only for service activities that are \neither a combination of traditional and modern services consumed mainly by households such \nas education and health, or modern services, intended for both households and businesses. \nFurther, their study finds that modern services not only have the highest productivity growth \namong the service industries, but their share in output tends to rise rapidly at high income \nlevels.  \n \nC.  Service Sector Development, Inclusive Growth, and the Role of Government \n \nUp to now, Asia relied largely on the trickle-down effect to spread the fruits of economic growth. \nThe implicit assumption behind the trickle-down effect is that growth itself, especially under the \ntype of sustained rapid growth which Asia enjoyed, would somehow automatically benefit the \nentire population, at least after some time lag. This assumption is not entirely without basis\u2014\nearly resource-scarce industrializers of East Asia, most notably the PRC; the Republic of Korea, \nand Taipei,China\u2014did in fact experience \u201cgrowth with equity\u201d to a remarkable degree. But this \nachievement was linked, at least in part, to specific characteristics, including high ratios of \npopulation to arable land, recovery from warfare, and productivity-boosting land reforms that are \nunlikely to be generally reproducible elsewhere (Noland and Pack 2003). \n \nHowever, in recent years, Asia has witnessed a growing popular demand for inclusive \ngrowth, which involves more of the population in the growth process and directly distributes the \nfruits of growth more widely. Two key ingredients of inclusive growth are expanded access to \neducation and productive employment. Services tend to be labor-intensive so they play a vital \nrole in generating productive employment opportunities. Therefore, at a broader level, service \nsector development can promote inclusive growth by creating jobs. Crucially, these include not \nonly jobs in the modern service industries but also jobs in the traditional service industries. \n \nWe should avoid generalizing about the job-creating capacity of manufacturing versus \nservices since both are heterogeneous. Some manufacturing industries tend to be more labor-\nintensive than others, and the same is true for services. As noted earlier, East and Southeast \nAsian countries were able to leverage their ample supply of labor by investing in labor-intensive \nmanufacturing  industries.  Nevertheless,  intuitively,  general  manufacturing  requires  a  larger \nstock of physical capital\u2014i.e., factories and machines\u2014than services and is thus more skewed \ntoward capital than services. Capital is typically held by the wealthy few while even the poor are \nendowed with unskilled labor. A shift in economic structure toward services can thus help to \nreduce poverty and inequality. The evidence resoundingly confirms that services have been a \nmajor source of jobs in Asia. In addition, there is some evidence that services development can \nreduce poverty. Finally, intuitively, services development may also be beneficial for gender \nequality.  ", "  Developing the Service Sector as Engine of Growth for Asia: An Overview   \u0406   37 \n \n \nThe policy question now facing Asian governments is: What activist policies can they \npursue to stimulate the growth of the service sector, beyond the standard litany of enabling \nreforms? These include easing entry to boost completion, reducing the regulatory burden, \nimproving  access  to  capital,  especially  for  entrepreneurs  and  small-  and  medium-sized \nenterprises, reducing taxation on labor, and increasing the flexibility to labor markets more \ngenerally, equalizing tax treatment across sectors where manufacturing activities are often \ntreated preferentially. One area where active government intervention can make a big difference \nis ICT infrastructure, especially broadband. ICT has large spillover effects on services and \nserved  as  a  catalyst  in  transforming  nontradable  services  into  tradable  services.  Telecom \nliberalization which brings down telecom service prices is a key in this context. With respect to \nefficiency of public services and utilities, privatization has largely fallen out of favor but fostering \nmore competitive markets remains the more basic challenge. \n \n \nXII. CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS \n \nAsia\u2019s  sustained  rapid  growth  has  been  fueled  to  a  large  extent  by  export-oriented \nindustrialization. This is especially true for East and Southeast Asian economies which have \ncollectively become the factory of the world. High savings and investment rates, in some cases \naugmented by large FDI inflows, allowed for a rapid buildup of physical capital stock. Openness \nto foreign technology and large workforces further expanded the capacity of those countries to \nmake and export goods. The manufacturing sectors of the region are woven together into a \nregional  production  network  in  which  different  countries specialize in  different parts  of the \nproduction process, further boosting productive efficiency and the region\u2019s role as a global \nmanufacturing hub. Reallocation of labor from low-productivity agriculture to high-productivity \nmanufacturing  underlay  the  region\u2019s  sustained  rapid  growth.  This  labor-intensive,  export-\noriented, manufacturing-based growth paradigm delivered the best of both worlds\u2014growth with \njobs\u2014for Asia. \n \nThere are a number of structural and external factors which compromise this growth \nparadigm. Above all, manufacturing is now maturing and its productivity levels have reached \nhigh  levels in  many  Asian  countries.  The  clearest  proof of  this  is  Asia\u2019s  role  as  a  global \nmanufacturing  hub.  As  manufacturing  matures,  its  productivity  improves,  its  capacity  to \ngenerate employment attenuates, and the scope for further productivity growth grows smaller. \nSince service industries tend to be labor-intensive, vitalizing service industries thus assumes an \neven greater importance in Asian employment. Therefore, Asia\u2019s future growth will depend \nincreasingly on raising productivity in the service sector, but productivity gains in services are \nhard  to  come  by.  Externally,  the  post-global  crisis  moderation  of  growth  in  the  advanced \neconomies calls for domestic demand\u2014and hence services which cater largely to domestic \ndemand\u2014to contribute more to Asia\u2019s future growth. \n \nThe sheer heterogeneity of the service sector, and inherent difficulty of measuring its \noutput  relative  to  manufacturing\u2014haircuts  versus  automobiles\u2014does  not  diminish  its \nsignificance. In the lower-income countries of Asia, traditional services account for much of the \nservice sector whereas in the higher-income countries, modern services play a bigger role. \nSuch diversity of Asian countries\u2019 service sectors necessarily means that each country faces \ndifferent priorities in service sector development, but strengthening modern services remains a \ncommon region-wide challenge. The intangible nature of many services does not take anything \naway from their very real economic effects, especially in employment but also broader economic \ndynamism. In addition, there are potentially large synergies between services on one hand and \nmanufacturing  and  the  rest  of  the  economy  on  the  other.  For  example,  efficient  energy, ", "38   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 320 \n \n \ntransportation and distribution networks boost the productivity of the manufacturing sector. A \nstrong modern service sector, in particular, business services such as design, prototyping and \nmarketing, can move middle-income Asian countries up the value chain toward higher value-\nadded activities and thus help them escape the much-feared middle income trap. \n \nOur overview of Asia\u2019s service sector indicates that it already accounts for a large share \nof the region\u2019s output and employment. This is hardly surprising since the industrialization \nprocess,  during  which  the  share  of  output  and  employment  in  both  services  and  industry \ntypically rise at the expense of agriculture, is under way in most of Asia, including its poorer, \nless developed economies. Furthermore, the growth of the service sector has already made a \nsizable contribution to the region\u2019s economic growth. We also find some evidence that service \nsector development can lower poverty in a region which still remains home to almost two-thirds \nof the world\u2019s poor despite a great deal of progress. At the same time, our overview indicates \nthat there is plenty of scope of further growth and development for Asia\u2019s service sector. For \none, traditional services still account for a large share of Asia\u2019s service sector. Partly as a result, \nthe Asia\u2019s service sector lags far behind the OECD in terms of labor productivity. \n \nThe gaping productivity gap between Asian countries and OECD economies implies a \nwide range of structural and policy impediments which must be removed in order for Asia to fully \nunleash the potential of the service sector as an engine of growth and jobs.  \n \nInternally, these include the strengthening of labor and capital markets, reform of tax \nregimes, and elimination of burdensome regulations which typically protect incumbent firms, and \nthus stifle competition and innovation (see, for example, W\u00f6lfl et al. 2010). The international \nhistorical experience shows that regulatory reforms often deliver significant economic benefits, \nsuch as higher labor productivity and lower prices (see, for example, OECD 2005).\u00a0 External \nbarriers such as barriers to trade in services also impede competition in domestic services \nmarkets. Reducing such barriers can not only promote efficiency and productivity in services but \nalso contribute directly to exports and growth\u2014e.g., India\u2019s well-known success as ICT-BPO \nexporter.  The  overall  guiding  principle  for  Asian  policymakers  must  be  to  create  a  more \ncompetitive environment for their service industries  \n ", " \nREFERENCES \n \nADB (Asian Development Bank). 2005.

However, the sector\u2019s productivity greatly lags that of the advanced \neconomies, which implies ample room for further growth.  The impact of the service sector  \non poverty reduction is less clear, but the paper finds some limited evidence of a poverty \nreduction effect. \nADB Economics  \nAbout the Asian Development Bank Working Paper Series\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the \nregion\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: 1.7 billion people who \nlive on less than $2 a day, with 828 million struggling on less than $1.25 a day.  ADB is committed \nto reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, \nand regional integration.\n  Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\nDeveloping the Service Sector as Engine of Growth  \nfor Asia: An Overview\nMarcus Noland, Donghyun Park, and Gemma B.
