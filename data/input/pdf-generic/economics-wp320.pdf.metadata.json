Our central objective is to broadly \nsurvey and analyze the current landscape of the region\u2019s service sector so as to \nassess  its  potential  to  serve  as  an  engine  for  inclusive  economic  growth.  Our \nanalysis  indicates  that  services  are  already  an  important  source  of  output, \ngrowth,  and  jobs  in  the  region.  However,  its  productivity  greatly  lags  that  of  the \nadvanced  economies,  which  implies  ample  room  for  further  growth.  The  impact \nof  service  sector  on  poverty  reduction  is  less  clear  but  we  do  find  some  limited \nevidence of a poverty reduction effect. One key challenge for all Asian countries \nis  to  improve  the  quality  of  service  sector  data.  Overall,  while  service  sector \ndevelopment  is  a  long  and  challenging  process,  creating  more  competitive \nservices  markets  by  removing  a  wide  range  of  internal  and  external  policy \ndistortions is vital for improving service sector productivity. As important as such \npolicy  reforms  are,  complementary  investments  in  physical  infrastructure  and \nhuman capital will also be necessary to achieve a strong service sector. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKeywords: Services, structural change, growth, productivity, Asia \n \nJEL Classification: L8, O14, O40, O47 \n\n\f \n\n\fI. INTRODUCTION: WHY DOES DEVELOPING ASIA  \nNEED TO STRENGTHEN ITS SERVICE SECTOR? \n\n \nAn integral part of the economic growth and development process is structural transformation. \nThe  structure  of  output  and  employment  changes  as  a  country  grows  and  develops.  A  well-\nknown stylized fact is that the share of agriculture in output and employment falls and the share \nof  manufacturing  and  services  correspondingly  rises  during  the  industrialization  process. \nBeyond  a  certain  point,  as  the  manufacturing  sector  matures,  productivity  growth  in \nmanufacturing  offsets  employment  growth  and  the  employment  share  of  services continues  to \nincrease while the employment share of manufacturing begins to decline. In some highly open \ncountries  in  East  and  Southeast  Asia,  comparative  advantage  is  strongly  concentrated  in \nmanufacturing,  and  the  manufacturing  share  of  output  itself  may  peak  and  decline  as  the \neconomy eventually rebalances in response to rising income and domestic demand, which has \na  larger  services  component,  increases  in  importance.  In  many  Asian  countries,  especially  in \nEast and Southeast Asia, the industrialization process has gone on for quite some time. In those \ncountries, the scope for further growth of the manufacturing sector is increasingly limited. \n\n \nWhile export-oriented industrialization has transformed East and Southeast Asia into the \nfactory  of  the  world,  the  region\u2019s  record  in  the  service  sector  has  been  much  less  impressive. \nAsia  does  have  some  well-known  success  stories,  such  as  India\u2019s  emergence  as  the  world\u2019s \nleading  information  and  communications  technology-business  process  outsourcing  (ICT-BPO) \nexporter  (see,  for  example,  Dossani  2010).  The  Philippines  is  also  emerging  as  a  major  ICT-\nBPO  hub.  However,  even  in  those  countries,  some  tradable  service  industries  rather  than  the \nentire service sector are performing well. Overall, there is a general perception that in Asia the \nproductivity  of  a  weak  service  sector  lags  a  strong,  internationally  competitive  manufacturing \nsector. And in some cases, where there are strong service sectors, there are concerns that they \nare effectively enclaves with weak backward and forward linkages to the rest of the economy. \nThis  matters  considerably  for  economic  growth  since  low  productivity  growth  in  the  service \nsector  can  retard  economy-wide  productivity  growth.  The  growing  tradability  of  services  and \nconsequent emergence of global supply chains in services, for example in health care, presents \nnew  growth  opportunities  for  a  region  which  is  heavily  involved  in  the  global  supply  chain  in \nmanufacturing. \n \nThere are a number of inter-related factors which further strengthen the case for a more \nvibrant Asian service sector at this point in time. For one, while Asia has grown faster than the \nrest of the world for decades, the global financial and economic crisis of 2008\u20132009 has cast a \ndark  cloud  over  its  future  growth  prospects.  The  crisis  originated  in  the  advanced  economies \nand  hit  those  economies  harder  than  the  developing  countries.  As  a  result,  the  post-crisis \nrecovery  has  been  noticeably  weaker  in  the  advanced  economies.  Furthermore,  in  the  euro \narea,  recovery  has  been  dealt  another  big  blow  by  the  ongoing  sovereign  debt  crisis.  The \nbottom line is that advanced economies are likely to experience a slowdown relative to the pre-\nglobal  crisis  period.  This  has  significant  adverse  ramifications  for  Asia\u2019s  export  and  growth \nprospects since advanced economies still take in a large share of Asia\u2019s manufactured exports \neven though their share has been declining. At a time when the manufactured exports engine is \nstalling, igniting the services engine can help offset the loss of growth momentum. \n\n \nTherefore, the global financial crisis has increased the urgency of the rebalancing effort \n(see, for example, ADB 2009).\u00a0\u00a0The global crisis and its pronounced effect on Asia\u2019s exports and \ngrowth shattered any notion that Asia had decoupled from the business cycle of the advanced \neconomies.  More  fundamentally,  it  highlighted  the  risks  of  disproportionate  dependence  on \nexports  and  a  corresponding  need  to  strengthen  domestic  demand.  As  a  result  of  strong \n\n\f2   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 320 \n \n \nsustained  growth,  millions  of  Chinese,  Indians,  Indonesians,  and  other  Asians  are  joining  the \nranks  of  the  middle  class  every  year.  This  implies  considerable  potential  growth  for  private \nconsumption and domestic demand. Relative to manufactured goods, services tend to be less \ntradable and more geared toward domestic demand.1 Developing the service sector goes hand \nin  hand  with  strengthening  domestic  demand,  especially  since  services  account  for  much  of \nprivate  consumption.  Service  sector  development  is  thus  the  supply  side  of  the  rebalancing \nequation.  From  a  global  perspective,  advanced  economies  have  a  comparative  advantage  in \nmodern  services  such  as  business  services.  Liberalizing  imports  of  such  services  can  thus \ncontribute not only to the competitiveness of Asian economies but also to global rebalancing. \n\n \nA dynamic service sector can also contribute to Asia\u2019s quest for inclusive growth which \nincludes  broader  swathes  of  the  population  in  the  growth  process  and  spreads  the  fruits  of \ngrowth more widely. Education and employment are especially important in reducing inequality \n(see, for example, ADB 2012).\u00a0 In the past, export-oriented industrialization gave Asia the best \nof  both  worlds\u2014lots  of  jobs  and  fast  growth.  Going  forward,  however,  Asia  will  find  it  more \nchallenging to achieve high growth and high employment. While demographic transition toward \nolder populations is already under way in Asia, for the most part Asia is still a relatively young \ncontinent.  Hundreds  of  millions  of  young  job-seeking  Asians  are  joining  the  workforce  every \nyear. Furthermore, as noted, the manufacturing sector is maturing in many parts of Asia so its \ncapacity to create jobs will become more limited. Relative to manufacturing, services tend to be \nlabor  intensive.  Therefore,  service  sector  growth  can  make  a  big  contribution  to  employment \nand thus inclusive growth. \n\n \n \nII. HETEROGENEITY OF SERVICE SECTOR AND MEASUREMENT PROBLEMS \n \n\nCompared  to  agriculture,  mining,  and  most  of  all,  manufacturing,  the  service  sector  has  long \noccupied a diminished place in both the public imagination and economic research. One reason \nis  the  sheer  diversity  of  the  sector,  encompassing  an  enormous  range  of  industries  and \nactivities which discourage simple mental imagery or easy encapsulation (see Table 1).2 In the \ncase of Asia, the intrinsic heterogeneity of the service sector is compounded by the enormous \nheterogeneity across countries. Asian countries are at very different stages in the development \nlevel of their service sector as well as overall economy. Not surprisingly, this heterogeneity has \nfar-reaching  policy  implications\u2014policy  solutions  for  fostering  the  service  sector  must \nnecessarily  be  country-specific  and  industry-specific.  Heterogeneity  also  entails  profound \nanalytical implications, as explained below. \n\n \nEichengreen  and  Gupta  (2009)  argue  that  the  broad  aggregation  of  services  obscures \ntwo distinct \u201cwaves\u201d of service sector growth. The first occurring in \u201ctraditional\u201d service sectors \n(such as personal services) early in the development process at relatively low levels of income \nand the second occurring later in the development process at higher incomes in activities such \nas  communication,  computer,  technical,  and  business  services)  that  are  more  intensive  in  the \nuse of information technology and possess greater scope for cross-border tradability. For some \npurposes,  it  may  be  useful  to  focus  on  a  more  limited  subset  of  service  activities  such  as \nbusiness  services  where  the  prospects  for  high-wage  employment  and  cross-border  trade \n\n                                                 \n1 \n\nIt is true that technological progress, for example in information and communications technology (ICT), is making \nservices more tradable, but overall services remain less tradable than goods. \n\n2   Furthermore, the definition of services is not always clear  cut. For example, potable  water, electricity, and other \npublic utilities are defined to be part of industry rather than services. In many Asian countries, a critical issue in \neconomic development is the lack of access to public utilities.  \n\n\f \n\nDeveloping the Service Sector as Engine of Growth for Asia: An Overview   \u0406   3 \n\n \n \nappear  relatively  high,  and  political  sensitivities  may  be  less  acute  than  in  sectors  such  as \neducation  or  health.  These  possibilities  may  not  be  inconsiderable:  Jensen  (2011)  points  out \nthat in the United States in 1960, business services employed less than half as many workers \ncompared to manufacturing, but by 2007, business services employment was more than double \nmanufacturing. \n \n\nTable 1: Economic Sectors and their Two digit NAICS Codes \n \n\nNAICS code  Sector \n11 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n31\u201333 \n42 \n44\u201345 \n48\u201349 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n61 \n62 \n71 \n72 \n81 \n92 \n\nAgriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting \nMining \nUtilities \nConstruction \nManufacturing \nWholesale trade \nRetail trade \nTransportation and warehousing \nInformation \nFinance and insurance \nReal estate and rental and leasing \nProfessional, scientific, and technical services \nManagement of companies and enterprises \nAdministration and support and waste management and remediation  services \nEducational services \nHealth care and social assistance \nArts, entertainment, and recreation \nAccommodation and food services \nOther services (except public administration) \nPublic administration \n\nNAICS = North American Industry Classification System. \n\nSource: US Census Bureau. http://www.census.gov \n\n \n \nThe  analytical  challenges  created  by  the  sector\u2019s  diversity  are  compounded  by  basic \nproblems  of  measurement.  The  output  of  many  service  sectors  is  hard  to  measure  (public \neducation, for example). In many countries, many service sector activities are highly regulated, \ninsulated  from  competition,  and  subject  to  administered  or  otherwise  regulated  prices  (again, \nthink public education). If neither outputs nor quantities are amenable to measurement, it goes \nwithout saying that the assessment of productivity and productivity change is difficult. Needless \nto  say,  these  conditions  stand  in  stark  contrast  to  those  prevailing  in  agriculture,  mining,  and \nmanufacturing,  where  output  is subject  to  greater  standardization  and enormous  attention  has \nbeen devoted to understanding the determinants of productivity. These analytical challenges are \neven  further  compounded  at  the  level  of  the  firm,  where  many  of  today\u2019s  major  multinational \ncorporations  with  their  origins  in  manufacturing  such  as  General  Motors  or  General  Electric \nhave large service sector divisions. Indeed, part of the apparent intensification of service sector \nactivity may reflect the changing nature of the firm, specifically outsourcing and off-shoring, with \nthe  latter  also  affecting  the  measurement  of  productivity  in  service-using  sectors  such  as \nmanufacturing (Yuskavage, Strassner, and Medieros 2008; Houseman et al. 2011).  \n\n \nThese  cross-sectoral  connections  are  key.  After  surveying  numerous  studies,  Francois \nand  Hoekman  (2010)  conclude  that  service  sector  performance  may  be  a  major  factor  in \nproductivity growth economy-wide, and that service sector policy in both its domestic and cross-\nborder manifestations may be a key driver in economic development.  \n\n \n\n\f4   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 320 \n \n \n\nIII. SERVICE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT AND PER CAPITA INCOME:  \nSOME KEY STYLIZED FACTS \n\n \nEconomists  have  a  troubling  tendency  to  look  for  lost  keys  under  the  lamppost  and  these \nanalytical  challenges  may  have  contributed  to  the  understudy  of  the  service  sector  relative  to \nothers. If this underemphasis was ever justified, the growth of the service sector relative to other \nparts of the economy makes it untenable today. Services output is positively correlated with per \ncapita  income  and  employment  shares  cross-sectionally  at  the  global  level  as  shown  in \nFigures 1  and  2,  respectively.  Services  output  is  also  correlated  with  educational  attainment \n(Figure 3). \n\nFigure 1: Snapshot: Log Services Value Added against Log GDP/Capita \n \n\n \n \n\nLog\u00a0Services\u00a0Value\u00a0Added\u00a0\n(2000\u00a0$)\n\n31\n\n29\n\n27\n\n25\n\n23\n\n21\n\n19\n\n17\n\n15\n\n5.0\n\n4.6\n\n4.2\n\n3.8\n\n3.4\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nLog\u00a0GDP\u00a0per\u00a0Capita\u00a0(2000\u00a0$)\n\nNote: Data reflect available observations from all countries for 2009 and are reported in constant 2000 $ . \n\nSource: World Bank, World Development Indicators online database (accessed 24 February 2012). \n\n \nFigure 2: 2009 Snapshot: Log Employment in Services against Log GDP/Capita \n \n\nLog\u00a0Share\u00a0of\u00a0\nEmployment\u00a0in\u00a0Services\n\n3.0\n\n7\n\n7.5\n\n8\n\n8.5\n\n9\n\n9.5\n\n10\n\n10.5\n\n11\n\nLog\u00a0GDP\u00a0per\u00a0Capita\u00a0(2000\u00a0US$)\n\nSource: World Bank, World Development Indicators online database (accessed 24 February 2012). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nDeveloping the Service Sector as Engine of Growth for Asia: An Overview   \u0406   5 \n\n \n \n\nFigure 3: Snapshot 2009: Log Services Value Added against School Life Expectancy  \n \n\nLog\u00a0Services\u00a0Value\u00a0Added\u00a0\n(2000\u00a0$)\n\n30\n\n27\n\n24\n\n21\n\n18\n\n15\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\nSchool\u00a0Life\u00a0Expectancy\n\n \n\nNote: School life expectancy (SLE) is the total number of years of schooling (primary to tertiary) that a child can expect to receive, \nassuming that the probability of his or her being enrolled in school at any particular future age is equal to the current enrollment ratio \nat that age. \n\nSources: Central Intelligence Agency. The World Factbook; World Bank. World Development Indicators online database (both \naccessed 24 February 2012). \n\n \n \nEichengreen  and  Gupta  argue  that  the  service  sector  of  output  rises  at  a  decelerating \nrate until it levels out at around $1,800 per capita (2000 purchasing power adjusted dollars) and \nthen accelerates again at about $4,000 per capita before leveling off again. It also appears that \nthe per capita income threshold for the second takeoff appears to have declined since around \n1990, presumably reflecting the diffusion and increased applicability of information technology. \nEducational  attainment  is  connected  to  the  capacity  to  successfully  adapt  to  the  local \nenvironment  innovations  originating  abroad.  The  second  wave  appears  to  be  more  acute  in \ndemocracies, in countries near major financial sectors, and economies relatively open to trade. \nTo this list, one could presumably append educational attainment. These tendencies suggest a \nprocess in which cross-border trade and investment are an important diffusion mechanism with \ndemocracies  being  more  open  to  information  technology,  possibly  placing  a  greater  emphasis \non education, and carrying a lower foreign investment risk premium.

Although it is true \nthat global services trade has risen over time relative to national income, the pattern in Asia is \nless clear (Figure 7). This outcome may partly be due to the policy impediments to cross-border \nexchange such as national regulations block or impede foreign service providers from gaining a \nfoothold in national markets. \n\n \n \n\nFigure 7: Trade in Services as % of GDP  \n \n\nSingapore\n\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of\n\nHong Kong, China\n\nPhilippines\n\nMalaysia\n\nPakistan\n\n1972\n\n1976\n\n1980\n\n1984\n\n1988\n\n1992\n\n1996\n\n2000\n\n2004\n\n2008\n\nSource: World Bank, World Development Indicators online database (accessed 24 February 2012). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 320 \n \n \n\nTrade in services has been dealt with unevenly at the multilateral, regional, and bilateral \nlevels. The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) identifies four modalities: trade in \nservices where physical interaction between the buyer and seller is unnecessary, analogous to \ntrade in goods; consumption abroad where the consumer travels to the provider (i.e., tourism); \ncommercial  presence  where  the  provider  establishes  a  facility  in  the  client\u2019s  country  (i.e., \ninvestment); and temporary movement of service providers to the client (i.e., migration). These \ndifferent  modalities  involve  differing  issues  and  complicate  negotiations;  the  process  is  further \ncomplicated  by  the  fact  that  countries  have  differing  comparative  advantages  and  interests  in \nliberalization across the range of service activities associated with differing modes of delivery.  \n\n \nServices trade policy restrictiveness tends to decline with per capita income (Figure 8). \nPresumably, causality runs in both directions: More open economies tend to grow faster and get \nrich, while for political economy reasons, rich economies with large service sectors tend not to \nimpose restrictions on these important and politically influential industries. However, differential \nperformance  with  respect  to  services  imports  and  exports  (Figures  9  and  10,  respectively) \nsuggests that the competitiveness of Asian service providers may also be an issue.  \n\n \n \n\nFigure 8: Trade Restrictiveness and per Capita Income \n \n\nDeveloping Asia\n\nDeveloping Europe\n\nLatin America and Caribbean\n\nMiddle East and North Africa\n\nSub-Saharan Africa\n\nHigh-income economies\n\nBAN\n\nINO\n\nTHA\n\nMAL\n\nIND\n\nPHI\n\nNEP\n\nVIE\n\nPAK\n\nCAM\n\nUZB\n\nKGZ\n\nSRI\n\nPRC\n\nMON\n\nGEO\n\nARM\n\nKAZ\n\nKOR\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nGross domestic product per capita (2005 constant purchasing power parity $\u2019000)\n\nARM = Armenia; BAN = Bangladesh; CAM = Cambodia; GEO = Georgia; IND = India; INO = Indonesia; KAZ = Kazakhstan;  \nKOR = Republic of Korea; KGZ = Kyrgyz Republic; MAL = Malaysia; MON = Mongolia; NEP = Nepal; PAK = Pakistan;  \nPHI = Philippines; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China; SRI = Sri Lanka; THA = Thailand=; UZB = Uzbekistan. \n\nNote: Data on restrictiveness of policy on services trade are from 2008 to 2011, and on gross domestic product in 2010. \n\nSources: Borchert, Gootiz, and Mattoo (2012); World Bank.

SERVICE SECTOR IN ASIA: THE BASIC FACTS \n \nAcross  the  region,  the  service  sector  has  clearly  been  on  the  rise,  whether  viewed  in \nterms  of  output  or  employment. From about 44% average share in 1980, the service sector \nnow accounts for slightly over one-half of GDP in developing Asia, but there is some variation \nacross  the  subregions  (Figure  11).3 In  East  Asia,  the  service  sector  comprises  about  60%  of \nGDP, and the current high share is mainly due to the newly industrializing economies (NIEs)\u2014\nHong  Kong,  China;  the  Republic  of  Korea;  and  Taipei,China\u2014with  services  shares  of  about \n60%\u201390% (Figure 12). But the PRC has also witnessed a significant rise in services, by roughly \n20  percentage  points  over  the  past  3  decades.  Compared  to  other  subregions,  the  service \nsector has been less dynamic in Southeast Asia; only Philippines and Singapore have services \nshares, rising to over one-half of GDP. A uniform pattern of rapidly growing service sector can \nbe seen across South Asia, most notably in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, where services shares \nhave risen by about 15\u201320 percentage points. In Central Asia, the surge of the service sector \nhas  been  quite  dramatic,  as  economies\u2019  newly  gained  independence  in  the  1990s  resulted  in \nthe  rise  of  new  service  activities.  Owing  to  their  geographic  conditions  and  significant  tourism \nsector, most Pacific countries have maintained large service sectors.  \n \n\nFigure 11: Sector Shares of GDP by Subregion \n \n\nAgriculture\n\nIndustry\n\nServices\n\n\u00a0\n\ni\n\ng\nn\np\no\ne\nv\ne\nD\n\nl\n\na\n\ni\ns\nA\n\na\n\ni\ns\nA\n\n\u00a0\nl\n\na\nr\nt\nn\ne\nC\n\na\n\ni\ns\nA\n\u00a0\nt\ns\na\nE\n\na\n\n\u00a0\n\ni\ns\nA\nh\nt\nu\no\nS\n\na\n\ni\ns\nA\n\u00a0\nt\ns\na\ne\nh\nt\nu\no\nS\n\nc\ni\nf\ni\nc\na\nP\ne\nh\nT\n\n\u00a0\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\n0\n\n20\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n40\n\n%\n\n \n\nNote: Countries covered are those with data around 1990, 2000, and 2010.

Majority of the employed \nare  now  in  services  in  several  economies,  including  Kazakhstan,  Malaysia,  the  Maldives,  the \nPhilippines,  and  the  NIEs  (Figure  13).  In  1990,  only  Singapore  and  Hong  Kong,  China  had \nservice employment shares of over one-half, while in the PRC, Cambodia, and Viet Nam, less \nthan 20% were employed in services. Since then, employment shares of the service sector have \nrisen by 10\u201320 percentage points in the latter set of economies. However, despite the rapid rise \nin  India\u2019s  services  output  share,  the  employment  share  of  its  services  remains  low  at  27%.  A \nsimilar concern holds true for other South Asian economies, particularly Bangladesh, Pakistan, \nand Sri Lanka, where services employment shares are quite low relative to their output shares.  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f12   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 320 \n \n \n\nFigure 13: Share of Services in Employment \n \n\n1990\n\nAround\u00a02009\n\nDeveloping\u00a0Asia\nHong\u00a0Kong,\u00a0China\nSingapore\nRepublic\u00a0of\u00a0Korea\nMaldives\nMalaysia\nTaipei,China\nKazakhstan\nPhilippines\nAzerbaijan\nKyrgyz\u00a0Republic\nMongolia\nIndonesia\nSri\u00a0Lanka\nArmenia\nThailand\nGeorgia\nPakistan\nBangladesh\nPRC\nBhutan\nCambodia\nIndia\nViet\u00a0Nam\n\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\n%\n\n \n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\nNote: Latest data refer to 2006 for Cambodia and the Maldives; 2007 for Georgia; 2008 for Armenia, the Kyrgyz Republic, and \nPakistan; and 2010 for Bangladesh and India.

In the past 10 years, the service sector accounted \nfor more than one-half of GDP growth in most economies in the region (Figure 14). Even during \nthe  1990s,  a  period  of  more  subdued  growth  for  the  region,  the  service  sector  contributed  to \nmost of the growth. Services\u2019 contribution to growth has been higher in South Asia than in other \nregions.  In  India,  the  Maldives,  and  Sri  Lanka,  roughly  over  60%  of  the  growth  in  2000\u20132010 \nwas  due  to  services.  In  Southeast  Asia,  the  service  sector  contributed  to  over  one-half  of  the \ngrowth in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore. But in East Asia, particularly the \nPRC;  the  Republic  of  Korea;  and  Taipei,China,  the  story  is  still  industry  rather  than  services, \ndriving overall growth. As noted in ADB (2007), the service sector has played an important role \nin  countries  where  the  pace  of  industrialization  has  been  slow  such  as  in  the  case  of  South \nAsian  countries  and  the  Philippines.

To cite an illustrative example, it may \nbe  the  case  that  a  country  has,  a  large  information  technology  sector,  but  that  sector  is \nessentially an enclave, oriented largely toward the global market, and does not generate much \nproductivity enhancement for the rest of the local economy.

LOW PRODUCTIVITY OF ASIA\u2019S SERVICE SECTOR \n\nAlthough the service sector has been rapidly rising across economies in the region, the sector \ncontinues to be dominated by traditional activities. As in the past, traditional services comprising \nwholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants, real estate, transport, personal services, and \npublic administration, continue to predominate (Table 2). At the other end are modern services \nwhich include information and communication, finance, and professional business services; they \ncomprise  only  about  8%\u201312%  of  the  economy  in  the  PRC,  India,  Indonesia,  Thailand,  and \nTaipei,China,  but  in  advanced  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development \n(OECD) economies such as France, Japan, and the US, they account for about 17%\u201325%.

For most \neconomies in the region, labor productivity is only less than 10% that of the OECD (Figure 19). \nBut there are economies which have already caught up with the OECD\u2014Hong Kong, China in \nas  early  as  1990,  and  Singapore  in  2000.  Taipei,China  is  also  closely  trailing  behind.  But  for \nmost  economies,  crude  estimates  based  on  an  average  growth  in  productivity  for  developing \nAsia,  at  4%  in  2000\u20132009,  indicate  that  it  might  take  about  15\u201330  years  to  reach  even  about \none-fifth of the OECD\u2019s current labor services productivity. Using the PRC and India\u2019s historical \ngrowth  for  services  productivity,  it  will  take  only  about  10  years  for  the  two  countries;  their \nproductivity  growth  rates,  at  around  8%,  are  much  higher  than  in  other  countries.  Meanwhile, \nthere  are  countries  where  services  productivity  levels  have  barely  moved  in  the  past  decade. \nFor example, while the Republic of Korea\u2019s productivity level is already 40% that of OECD, labor \nproductivity growth has only been less than 1%, and according to some estimates, total factor \nproductivity growth has actually been negative (Schiff 2007, Hyundai Research Institute 2010). \nSimilarly  for  Thailand,  labor  services  productivity  has  been  stagnant.  In  some  economies  with \nrelatively  large  service  sectors  such  as  Pakistan,  the  Philippines,  and  Sri  Lanka,  labor \nproductivity growth rates have only averaged about 2%\u20133%. \n\nFigure 19: Labor Productivity in Services \n \n\n1990\n\n2000\n\nLate\u00a02000s\n\n \n \n\n \n\nOECD\n\nHong\u00a0Kong,\u00a0China\n\nSingapore\n\nTaipei,China\n\nRepublic\u00a0of\u00a0Korea\n\nMalaysia\n\nMaldives\n\nThailand\n\nIndia\n\nPRC\n\nKazakhstan\n\nSri\u00a0Lanka\n\nPhilippines\n\nArmenia\n\nPakistan\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nIndonesia\n\nMongolia\n\nCambodia\n\nViet\u00a0Nam\n\nKyrgyz\u00a0Republic\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n2000\u00a0Constant\u00a0$\u00a0('000)\n\n \n\nOECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, PRC = People's Rep. of China. \n\nSources: Authors\u2019 estimates using data from ADB (2007); CEIC Data Company; International Labour Organization.

In  South  Asian  countries,  particularly,  India,  the \nMaldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, the reverse is true: Their service sectors have less catching \nup to do with the OECD\u2019s productivity level compared to their industrial sector. But overall, most \neconomies face the daunting task of closing the productivity gap, either in industry or services. \n\nFigure 20: Labor Productivity in Industry \n \n\n1990\n\n2000\n\nLate 2000s\n\n \n \n\n \n\nOECD\n\nSingapore\n\nRepublic of  Korea\n\nTaipei,China\n\nHong Kong, China\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nMalaysia\n\nThailand\n\nKazakhstan\n\nArmenia\n\nPRC\n\nPhilippines\n\nMaldives\n\nIndonesia\n\nCambodia\n\nSri Lanka\n\nMongolia\n\nIndia\n\nPakistan\n\nViet Nam\n\nKyrgyz Republic\n\nSources: Authors\u2019 estimates using data from ADB (2007); CEIC Data Company; International Labour Organization.

World Development Indicators online database (databases accessed 16 April 2012). \n\n \nThe  wide  gap  in  services  labor  productivity  between  OECD  and  developing  Asia \nsuggests that much remains to be done to transform the region\u2019s service sector. On a positive \nnote,  this  implies  that  there  is  plenty  of  room  for  productivity  growth  in  services  and  thus  for \nservices  to  contribute  to  Asia\u2019s  future  economic  growth.  While  a  major  shift  toward  a  larger \nservice sector has occurred in most economies in the region, not so much has changed in terms \nof the composition of services. Gauging by the pace by which the mix of service activities has \nevolved, the process of achieving a more sophisticated and modern service sector is more likely \nto entail a long process. Asian economies can either wait for the process to take hold or initiate \nbold  steps  to  hasten  the  process.  And  while  moving  toward  modern  and  high-productivity \nservices  is a  desirable path  for  economies  trapped  in  traditional  and  low-productivity  services, \nfor the poor an immediate concern is that services should act as a direct instrument in bringing \nabout a more inclusive growth, an issue we explore in the next section. \n\n \nGoing forward, fostering productivity growth in services will require tackling both \ninternal  and  external  distortions.  Liberalizing  trade  and  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI)  in \nservices can promote productivity and efficiency for the same reasons as goods trade and FDI. \nOne specific channel is via imports of modern business services from the advanced economies. \nHowever, in order to ensure productivity growth of the service sector as a whole rather than a \nfew  high-productivity  enclaves,  it  is  vital  to  remove  domestic  distortions  such  as  excessive \nregulation.  A  more  competitive  market  environment  resulting  from  the  removal  of  internal  and \nexternal distortions holds the key to lifting productivity growth.  \n\n\f22   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 320 \n \n \n\nA more  productive  service  sector  has  positive  spillover  effect  on  manufacturing \nand  the  rest  of  the  economy.  For  example,  efficient  information  and  communications \ntechnology  (ICT)  and  transportation  can  promote  productivity  across  the  entire  economy.  A \nstrong modern service sector, in particular business services such as design, prototyping, and \nmarketing  can  help  middle  income  Asian  countries  move  up  the  value  chain  and  thus  escape \nthe much-feared middle income trap.  \n\n \nThe  government  can  help  lay  the  foundation  for  a  vibrant  service  sector  through  both \npolicy  reform  and  investments  in  physical  infrastructure  and  human  capital.  As  evident  in  the \nrise  of  India\u2019s  ICT-BPO  sector  due  to  lack  of  regulation  and  the  PRC\u2019s  stunted  service  sector \ndue  to  pro-manufacturing  policy  bias,  removing  policy  distortions  can  help.  The  experience  of \nboth the PRC and India show that policy distortions can stunt the growth of the service sector. \nAt  the  same  time,  the  government  can  take  active  measures  to  create  a  more  conducive \nenvironment  for  the  service  sector\u2014e.g.,  investing  in  physical  infrastructure  such  as  telecom \nand  education/human  capital.  Good  infrastructure  and  adequate  supply  of  human  capital  are \nespecially important for the modern service industries such as the ICT-BPO industry. \n\n \n \nVI. ASIA\u2019S SERVICE SECTOR HAS SOME EFFECT ON POVERTY REDUCTION  \nAND THUS INCLUSIVE GROWTH \n \nServices growth is correlated with poverty reduction (Box 1 and Figure 22). The question \nis  whether  one  can  say  anything  more  definitive.  Once  the  initial  level  of  poverty  is  taken  into \naccount,  one  can  think  of  a  number  of  variables  related  to  economic  performance  and \ninstitutional characteristics that might affect poverty alleviation. In the former category, structural \nfactors such as the differential growth of the agricultural, industrial, and service sectors, or the \ngrowth  of  public  consumption  are  obvious  possibilities.  High  levels  of  physical  and  human \ncapital  accumulation,  in  the  latter  case  particularly  with  respect  to  women,  may  be  associated \nwith  rapid  and  inclusive  growth.  There  is  also  some  evidence  that  land-scarce  countries  may \nhave somewhat distinct developmental trajectories and this profile may be particularly amenable \nto growth with equity (Leamer 1987). \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nDeveloping the Service Sector as Engine of Growth for Asia: An Overview   \u0406   23 \n\n \n \n\nFigure 22: Change in Poverty and Annual Growth in Services Output, 1990\u20132010 \n \n\nDeveloping Asia\n\nRest of the world\n\nARM\n\nAZE\n\nIND\n\nLAO\n\nCAM\n\nMAL\n\nPHI\n\nTHA\n\nSRI\n\nKGZ\n\nBAN\n\nINO\n\nNEP\n\nPAK\n\nTAJ\n\nVIE\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n-40\n\n-60\n\nC\nh\na\nn\ng\ne\n\n \ni\n\nn\n\n \n\np\no\nv\ne\nr\nt\ny\n \nh\ne\na\nd\nc\no\nu\nn\n\nt\n \n(\np\ne\nr\nc\ne\nn\n\nt\n\n \n\na\ng\ne\np\no\nn\nt\ns\n)\n\ni\n\nPRC\n\n10.0\n\n \n\n-5.0\n\n0.0\n\n5.0\nGrowth in services output (%)\n\nARM = Armenia; AZE = Azerbaijan; BAN = Bangladesh; CAM = Cambodia; IND = India; INO = Indonesia; KGZ = Kyrgyz; Republic; \nLAO = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; MAL = Malaysia; NEP = Nepal; PAK = Pakistan; PHI = Philippines;  \nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China; SRI = Sri Lanka; TAJ = Tajikistan; THA = Thailand; VIE = Viet Nam. \n\nSource: Authors' estimates based on data from  World Bank, World Development Indicators online database (accessed 16 April \n2012). \n\n \nInstitutionally,  there  is  some  evidence  that  democracies  tend  to  have  more  inclusive \ngrowth  (though  the  direction  of  causality  is  debatable),  and  it  would  not  be  surprising  if  there \nwere  long-lasting  legacy  effects  embedded  in  formerly  centrally  planned  economies  (CPE) \n(Perotti 1996). \n \nHowever,  the  problem  that  immediately  arises  is  that  these  characteristics  are  highly \ncorrelated,  and  this  high  degree  of  collinearity  may  frustrate  the  precise  identification  of  the \ncausal channels of these effects. As shown in Table 3, the reduction in poverty is not only highly \ncorrelated with the initial level of poverty and the subsequent growth of the service sector, but \nmany  other  variables  as  well.  Apart  from  its  initial  level,  the  three  variables  most  highly \ncorrelated with change in poverty levels are the urban population share (surprisingly associated \nwith  a  slower  reduction  in  poverty),  being  an  Asian  developing  country,  and  the  growth  of \nservices  output,  both  associated  with  more  rapid  poverty  reduction.  So  it  is  not  a  stretch  to \nexpect  that  the  performance  of  the  service  sector  may  have  a  significant  impact  on  poverty \nreduction and inclusive growth, more broadly. \n\n \n \n\n\f24   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 320 \n\nTable 3: Correlations with Poverty Reduction Variables \n \n\nPoverty \nChange \n\nInitial Poverty \nLevel \n\nServices \nGrowth \n\nAgricultural \nGrowth \n\nManufacturing \nGrowth \n\nFemale \nEducation \n\nPolity IV \n\nGovernment \nConsumption Investment\n\nArable  \nLand \n\nUrban \nPopulation \n\nFormer  \nCPE \n\nDMC -\nDeveloping \nAsia \n\n1.000 \n0.1704*** \n0.5745*** \n0.0428* \n\u20130.0521** \n0.3815*** \n0.5202*** \n\n0.2958*** \n0.1817*** \n\u20130.2273*** \n\u20130.3148*** \n\n1.000 \n0.2729*** \n\u20130.0687*** \n\u20130.1459*** \n0.2196*** \n0.2122*** \n\n0.0554** \n\u20130.1905*** \n0.0399* \n\u20130.2088*** \n\n1.000 \n\n\u20130.1599*** \n\u20130.1535*** \n0.2019*** \n0.3465*** \n\n0.0434* \n0.3107*** \n\n\u20130.0246 \n\u20130.4383*** \n\n1.000 \n0.4954*** \n0.3209*** \n\n\u20130.0089 \n\n1.000 \n\n\u20130.1503*** \n\u20130.0135 \n\n1.000 \n0.3049*** \n\n1.000 \n\n0.0492*** \n0.1954*** \n0.2739*** \n0.4809*** \n\n\u20130.0510*** \n0.0129 \n0.0655*** \n0.4802*** \n\n0.3152*** \n\n\u20130.0376 \n\u20130.0976*** \n\u20130.0356 \n\n0.0428** \n0.1578*** \n\u20130.2047*** \n\u20130.3452*** \n\n1.000 \n0.0102 \n\u20130.0321* \n\u20130.1766*** \n\n1.000 \n\u20130.1258***\n0.0181 \n\n1.000 \n0.2197***\n\n1.000 \n\nPoverty Change  \nInitial Poverty Level \nServices Growth \nAgricultural Growth \nManufacturing Growth \nFemale Education \nPolity IV \nFormer CPE \nDMC - Developing Asia \nGovernment \nConsumption \nInvestment \nArable Land \nUrban Population \n\n1.000 \n\n\u20130.7333*** \n\u20130.3700*** \n\u20130.3940*** \n\u20130.3602*** \n0.2111*** \n0.2655*** \n\u20130.2190*** \n\u20130.4688*** \n\n\u20130.2177*** \n\u20130.1477*** \n0.2416*** \n0.5728*** \n\n1.000 \n0.1264*** \n0.3987*** \n0.2236*** \n\u20130.4907*** \n\u20130.4992*** \n0.0122 \n0.2490*** \n\n0.1251*** \n\u20130.0694*** \n\u20130.1516*** \n\u20130.7051*** \n\nCPE = centrally planned economy. \n\nNote: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. \n\n \n \n\n \n\nSources: World Bank, World Development Indicators; Barro-Lee Dataset; Polity IV Project; Penn World Tables (all data accessed 24 February 2012); Authors' estimates. \n\n\fDeveloping the Service Sector as Engine of Growth for Asia: An Overview   \u0406   25 \n\nTo  examine  this  possibility  more  definitively,  some  multivariate  regressions  were \nestimated on data for 56 countries, of which 17 are developing Asian economies, covering the \nperiod  1990\u20132010.  The  form  of  the  model  follows  the  commonly  used  convergence  growth \nmodel  in  which,  conditional  on  the  starting  level  value  of  the  dependent  variable,  the \ndeterminants  of  the  rapidity  of  its  change  are  estimated.  This  approach  to  the  analysis  of \npoverty reduction has been previously explored for a shorter period, 1990\u20132005, by Ghani and \nKharas (2010). This is but one indicator of inclusive growth; one can think of others, such as the \nlevel of employment, or employment by particular, traditionally disadvantaged groups, such as \nwomen. These regressions are reported in Table 4. \n\n \nControlling  for  initial  poverty,  poverty  change  is  regressed  against  growth  in  services, \nagricultural, and manufacturing outputs. We also explored a number of other potential drivers of \npoverty  reduction:  educational  attainment,  particularly  female  educational  attainment;  Polity  IV \ndemocracy  scores  (per  Kuznets  a  reduction  in  inequality  with  rising  per  capita  income  may \nreflect a greater weight put on poverty reduction due to democratization), physical investment; \ngovernment  consumption;  urbanization;  and  the  abundance  of  arable  land  (there  is  evidence \nthat  land-scarce  countries  may  have  unique  development  paths  distinctively  amenable  to \ninclusive growth); due to their distinct institutional organization, status as former CPEs; status as \na developing Asia country, as well as sample period.  \n\n \nIn  this  multivariate  framework,  most  of  the  potential  regressors  were  found  not  to  be \nrobustly correlated with poverty reduction. As expected, initial poverty is consistently correlated \nwith  poverty  reduction,  indicating  that  countries  with  higher  poverty  rates  tend  to  have  faster \nrates of poverty reduction. Results of the basic model (specification 1 in Table 4) indicate that \nchange  in  poverty  is  negatively  related  to  growth  in  services  output,  i.e.,  growth  in  services \noutput  growth  is  significantly  associated  with  poverty  reduction.  Neither  agricultural  nor \nmanufacturing output growth is significant in the model. Additionally, former CPEs exhibit more \nrapid  rates  of  poverty  reduction.  The  results  are  broadly  in  line  with  the  results  of  Ghani  and \nKharas.  In  specification  2,  the  share  of  females  attending  secondary  school  or  higher  at  the \nbeginning  of  the  sample  period  is  included.  Female  education  is  significantly  associated  with \npoverty  reduction.  Service  output  growth,  initial  poverty,  and  status  as  a  former  CPE  remain \nsignificant.  In  specification  3,  we  remove  the  former  CPE  variable  as  well  as  the  insignificant \nmanufacturing and agricultural growth variables. In their place, we introduce a developing Asia \nbinary  variable.  To  be  clear,  it  is  not  theoretically  obvious  why  specific  regions  of  the  world \nshould exhibit distinctive results. That said, status as a developing Asian country appears to be \nsignificantly  correlated  with  poverty  reduction.  Specification  4  reincorporates  former  CPE  into \nthe  model  while  retaining  developing  Asia.  The  developing  Asia  dummy  absorbs  so  much \nsample  variation  that  the  coefficients  on  several  apparently  robust  regressors,  including  the \nservices variable, become statistically insignificant.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 320 \n\nTable 4: Cross-country Regressions on Change in Poverty Headcount (at $1.25 a day), 1990-2010 \n \n(4.3) \n\u20130.437*** \n(0.068) \n\n(4.6) \n\u20130.450*** \n(0.069) \n\n(4.8) \n\u20130.405*** \n(0.059) \n\n \n\n\u20136.816** \n(3.088) \n\u20130.908* \n(0.515) \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n(4.1) \n\u20130.421*** \n(0.072) \n\u20137.681*** \n(2.465) \n\n(4.2) \n\u20130.465*** \n(0.072) \n\u20136.007* \n(3.231) \n\n\u20131.179*** \n(0.438) \n\u20130.358 \n(0.819) \n0.051 \n(0.326) \n\n\u20131.138** \n(0.480) \n0.105 \n(0.778) \n\u20130.104 \n(0.425) \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n-0.123* \n(0.070) \n\n\u20130.129** \n(0.056) \n\n\u20130.097 \n(0.071) \n\n21.706*** \n(5.905) \n56 \n\n0.685 \n\n24.941*** \n(7.251) \n52 \n\n0.692 \n\n18.572*** \n(6.078) \n54 \n\n0.706 \n\n18.917*** \n(6.554) \n52 \n\n0.716 \n\n(4.4) \n\u20130.428*** \n(0.071) \n\u20133.781 \n(3.536) \n\u20136.819* \n(3.533) \n\u20130.711 \n(0.509) \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n(4.5) \n\u20130.501*** \n(0.067) \n\u20138.136** \n(3.780) \n\n\u20131.076** \n(0.498) \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\u20130.071 \n(0.085) \n\u20130.387 \n(0.267) \n24.111*** \n(6.173) \n52 \n\n0.708 \n\n\u20137.651** \n(3.251) \n\u20130.846 \n(0.550) \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\u20130.108 \n(0.070) \n\u20130.217 \n(0.233) \n16.898** \n(6.289) \n52 \n\n0.716 \n\n(4.7) \n\u20130.485*** \n(0.062) \n\u20138.682*** \n(2.611) \n\n\u20131.171** \n(0.456) \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n\u20138.791*** \n(2.942) \n\u20130.913 \n(0.553) \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n(4.9) \n\u20130.447*** \n(0.062) \n\u20136.169** \n(2.632) \n\u20136.560** \n(2.963) \n\u20130.673 \n(0.483) \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n\u20130.427* \n(0.220) \n22.193*** \n(5.714) \n56 \n\n0.707 \n\n\u20130.292 \n(0.205) \n10.667* \n(6.008) \n56 \n\n0.711 \n\n\u20130.363* \n(0.204) \n16.463*** \n(5.991) \n56 \n\n0.730 \n\nInitial Poverty Level \n  \nFormer CPE \n  \nDeveloping Asia \n  \nServices output growth \n  \nAgricultural output growth \n  \nManufacturing output growth \n  \nShare of females attending secondary school or \nhigher in 1990 \n  \nPolity Index (index range= \u201310 to 10) \n  \nConstant \n  \nObservations \nR-squared \n\nCPE = centrally planned economy. \n\nNotes: Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. \u201c***\u201d means significant at 1%, \u201c**\u201d at 5%, and \u201c*\u201d at 10%.

As  a  consequence  of \ncollinearity between female education and the polity score, the estimated coefficients on these \nvariables are not statistically significant, though they are jointly significant at the 90% confidence \nlevel. In specification 6, the former CPE dummy is replaced with the developing Asia dummy. As \nwith  specification  4,  developing  Asia  absorbs  sufficient  sample  variation  to  render  the  service \noutput, female education, and polity score coefficients insignificant. Jointly, the three variables \nare significant at the 95% confidence level. Similarly, female education and service production \nare  jointly  significant  at  the  90%  confidence  level.  In  short,  it  appears  that  female  educational \nattainment,  services  output,  and  the  democracy  indicator  are  all  correlated  with  poverty \nreduction, but teasing out the precise relationship is hampered by multicollinearity.  \n\n \nIn  specifications  7  through  9,  the  female  education  variable  is  dropped  while  the \ndemocracy  variable  is  retained.  Specification  7  uses  the  former  CPE  control  and  produces \nsignificant  results  for  all  included  variables  with  polity  score  indicating  a  significant  correlation \nwith poverty reduction. Specification 8 includes the developing Asia dummy without the former \nCPE  variable.  The  results  from  equations  4  and  6  are  repeated  as  the  inclusion  of  the \ndeveloping  Asia  dummy  renders  the  coefficients  on  the  services  and  polity  score  variables \ninsignificant.  Finally,  specification  9  includes  the  former  CPE  and  developing  Asia  controls \njointly  along  with  the  polity  score  variable.  Unlike  specification  4  in  which  the  coefficient  on \nstatus as a former CPE was insignificant, in specification 9, the estimated coefficients on both \nthe  former  CPE  and  developing  Asia  dummies  are  significant.  A  country\u2019s  polity  score  is  also \nsignificantly  correlated  with  poverty  reduction  in  this  specification.  Services  output  growth, \nhowever, is not significant in this case.  \n\n \nIn  sum,  visual  inspection  of  the  data  along  the  lines  of  Figure  22  confirm  that  services \noutput is associated with inclusive growth. The simple correlations reported in Table 3 show that \nthe  growth  of  services  output  is  the  structural  characteristic  more  highly  correlated  with  the \nreduction  of  poverty.  The  high  degree  of  multicollinearity  among  the  variables  of  interest \nfrustrate  identifying  the  precise  causal  channels,  but  the  multivariate  regressions  reported  in \nTable  4  establish  that  while  there  is  evidence  that  services  growth  is  associated  with  poverty \nreduction,  the  relationship  does  not  appear  to  be  robust.  What  can  be  said  definitively  is  that \nthere is no evidence that growth of services output is associated with worsening poverty. \n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nVII. SERVICES, GENDER EQUALITY, AND ENVIRONMENTALLY  \nSUSTAINABLE GROWTH \n\nIn  addition  to  poverty  reduction,  greater  gender  equality  is  another  key  dimension  of  more \ninclusive  growth.  In  particular,  expanding  access  to  education  and  employment  opportunities \nholds  the  key  to  including  women  in  the  growth  process  and  spreading  the  fruits  of  growth  to \nwomen. Asian countries are recently paying more attention to the environmental costs of rapid \ngrowth  and  developing  the  service  sector  can  contribute  to  more  environmentally  sustainable \ngrowth. \n \nServices and Gender Equality \n \n\nA. \n\nIntuitively,  as  an  economy  evolves  from  agriculture  to  manufacturing  and  services,  service \nsector growth should be more conducive for female employment since services jobs tend to be \nless  physically  demanding  than  manufacturing  jobs.  Development  of  the  service  sector  can \nwiden employment opportunities for both men and women, but especially so for women. Indeed \n\n\f28   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 320 \n \n \nthe  World  Development  Report  (World  Bank  2012)  shows  that  across  77  countries,  services \naccounts for a higher proportion of female employment than male employment, and the reverse \nis true for manufacturing.  \n\n \nGhani (2010) supports the view that the growth of services is key to female employment. \nHe finds that countries where services account for a higher share  of  employment  have  higher \nfemale labor force participation rates. In India and Pakistan, the service sector experienced the \nlargest  growth  in  female  labor  force  participation  over  the  past  three  decades.  Furthermore,  a \nthriving  modern  service  sector  in  India  opened up  huge  employment  opportunities  for  women. \nWomen account for 30% of the information technology (IT) services and information technology \nenabled  services  (ITES)  workforce  in  India,  which  is  higher  than  female  share  of  services \nemployment. But while advances in information and communication technologies can open up \nnew  job  possibilities  for  women,  they  can  also  entail  female  job  insecurity  and  gender  wage \ndisparities  rooted  in  gender  gaps  in  access  to  education  and  acquisition  of  skills.  Addressing \nsuch  gaps  will  be  crucial  in  enhancing  the  potential  of  the  service  sector  in  reducing  gender \ndisparities in the labor market. \n\nB. \n\n \nServices and Environmentally Sustainable Growth \n \n\nAs  noted  earlier,  as  countries  grow  richer,  the  relative  importance  of  services  in  the  economy \ntends  to  rise.  In  addition,  the  general  public  tends  to  demand  a  cleaner  environment  in  richer \ncountries,  which  consequently  invest  more  in  protecting  the  environment.  The  two  stylized \nfacts\u2014cleaner  environment  and services-oriented  economy\u2014may  not be  independent  of  each \nother. Relative to agriculture and manufacturing, the service sector tends to be less resource-\nintensive  and  thus  places  less  strain  on  the  environment.  For  example,  food  and  beverage \nmanufacturing  uses  resource  inputs  such  as  agricultural  products,  land,  water,  fuel,  and \nelectricity, in addition to labor input. In contrast, an IT firm is highly dependent only on labor and \nelectricity.  Furthermore,  IT  exports  can  be  sent  through  the  internet  and  so  will  require  less \ntransport and energy costs than manufacturing exports. \n\n \nThe relationship between services and environment can also be analyzed in terms of the \npotential  impact  of  certain  environmental  risks  on  services.  For  example,  climate  change  will \naffect  the  availability  of  resources,  but  its  impact  will  be  less  serious  for  the  service  sector \ncompared to its impact on the agricultural and industrial sectors. Still, there are service sector \nactivities such as tourism, transport, and telecommunications which can be adversely affected \nby  severe  changes  in  the  environment  (World  Resources  Institute  and  International  Finance \nCorporation  2009).  But  overall,  considering  the  relatively  low  resource-intensity  of  services, \nenvironmental changes are expected to have less direct impact on services compared to other \nsectors. This suggests that resource degradation and depletion will pose a bigger constraint to \nthe  expansion  of  output  in  agriculture  and  manufacturing  sectors  than  in  services.  Going \nforward, it may be less environmentally costly to expand services than other sectors. \n\n \n \n\n \n\nVIII. SERVICES, URBANIZATION, AND INFORMALITY \n\nAsian economies are increasingly becoming more urbanized. Several cities in the region such \nas New Delhi, Seoul, and Shanghai are among the largest megacities in the world. Urbanization \ncan  be  viewed  as  a  natural  consequence  of  economic  growth.  For  the  service  sector, \nurbanization  can  be  a  major  driver  of  the  sector\u2019s  growth.  At  the  same  time,  urbanization, \nespecially at the early stages, tends to generate more informal sector activities which in turn are \nalso associated with the service sector.  \n\n\f \n\nDeveloping the Service Sector as Engine of Growth for Asia: An Overview   \u0406   29 \n\nUrbanization and Service Sector  \n\n \n \nA. \n \nRising urbanization is associated with higher income which in turn raises the demand for a wide \narray of services. Thus, both traditional and modern services thrive in urban locations. There is \na  tendency  for  service  sector  industries  to  locate  in  urban  areas  to  enable  proximity  to  both \nclients and suppliers. Face-to-face interaction with clients is important for many service sector \nindustries such as retailing, education, health, and other community and personal services, so \nthe presence of a large concentration of people in urban locations is ideal for the service sector. \nService  sector  industries  also  often  cater  to  varying  business  activities,  so  they  will  locate  in \nareas with dense and diverse business settings (Kolko 2010). The evidence for Asia indicates \nthat  more  urbanized  economies  have  larger  services  output  and  employment  shares  (Figures \n23  and  24).  The  rapid  urbanization  of  Asian  economies  is  therefore  another  reason  to  expect \nthat services will become more important as a source of growth and jobs. \n \n \n\n \nFigure 23: Urbanization Rate and Share of Services in GDP, Developing Asia,  \n2009 (%) \n \n\nMLD\n\nFIJ\n\nGEO\n\nTAP\n\nKOR\n\nPHI\n\nKAZ\n\nMON\n\nARM\n\nMAL\n\nTON\n\nKIR\n\nSRI\n\nSAM\n\nSOL\n\nNEP\n\nAFG\n\nIND\nTAJ\n\nBAN\n\nKGZ\n\nPAK\n\nUZB\n\nTHA\n\nPRC\n\nCAM\n\nLAO\n\nVIE\nMYA\n\nBHU\n\nINO\n\nTKM\n\nAZE\n\nPNG\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nUrbanization rate\n\n80\n\nHKG\n\nSIN\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\nS\nh\na\nr\ne\n \no\nf\n \ns\ne\nr\nv\nc\ne\ns\n \ni\nn\n \nG\nD\nP\n\ni\n\n20\n\n100\n\n \n\nAFG = Afghanistan; ARM = Armenia; AZE = Azerbaijan; BAN = Bangladesh; BHU = Bhutan; CAM = Cambodia; FIJ = Fiji;  \nGEO = Georgia; HKG = Hong Kong, China; IND = India; INO = Indonesia; KAZ = Kazakhstan; KIR = Kiribati; KOR = Korea, Rep. of; \nKGZ = Kyrgyz Republic; LAO = Lao PDR; MAL = Malaysia; MLD = Maldives; MON = Mongolia; MYA = Myanmar; NEP = Nepal; \nPAK = Pakistan; PHI = Philippines; PNG = Papua New Guinea; PRC = China, People's Rep. of; SAM = Samoa; SIN = Singapore; \nSOL = Solomon Islands; SRI = Sri Lanka; TAP = Taipei,China; TAJ = Tajikistan; THA = Thailand; TON = Tonga;  \nTKM = Turkmenistan; UZB = Uzbekistan; VIE = Viet Nam. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f30   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 320 \n \n \n\nFigure 24: Urbanization Rate and Share of Services in Employment, Developing Asia, \n2009 (%) \n \n\nHKG\n\nSIN\n\nKOR\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\ni\n\nS\nh\na\nr\ne\n \no\nf\n \ns\ne\nr\nv\nc\ne\ns\n \ni\nn\n \ne\nm\np\no\ny\nm\ne\nn\nt\n\nl\n\n20\n\n100\n\n \n\nMLD\n\nKGZ\n\nMAL\n\nTAP\n\nPHI\n\nKAZ\n\nMON\n\nAZE\n\nINO\n\nARM\n\nSRI\n\nTHA\n\nPRC\n\nPAK\n\nGEO\n\nBAN\n\nCAM\n\nBHU\n\nIND\n\nVIE\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nUrbanization rate\n\n80\n\nARM = Armenia; AZE = Azerbaijan; BAN = Bangladesh; BHU = Bhutan; CAM = Cambodia; GEO = Georgia; HKG = Hong Kong; \nChina; IND = India; INO = Indonesia; KAZ = Kazakhstan; KOR = Republic of Korea; KGZ = Kyrgyz; Republic; MAL = Malaysia;  \nMLD = Maldives; MON = Mongolia; PAK = Pakistan; PHI = Philippines; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China; SIN = Singapore;  \nSRI = Sri Lanka; TAP = Taipei,China; THA = Thailand; VIE = Viet Nam. \n\nNote: Employment data refer to 2006 for Cambodia and the Maldives; 2007 for Georgia; 2008 for Armenia, the Kyrgyz Republic, and \nPakistan; and 2010 for Bangladesh and India. \n\nSources: CEIC Data Company; World Bank.

URBANIZATION AND INFORMAL SECTOR EMPLOYMENT \n\n \n\nThe  informal  sector  is  a  large  part  of  the  economy  in  many  Asian  countries.  As  share  of \nnonagricultural  employment,  the  informal  sector  accounts  for  over  60%  in  Cambodia,  India, \nIndonesia,  Pakistan,  Sri  Lanka,  and  Viet  Nam  (Figure  25).  Since  the  informal  sector  is  often \ndominated  by  the  service  sector,  this  provides  another  reason  to  suspect  that  services  are  a \nlarge part of output and employment. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nDeveloping the Service Sector as Engine of Growth for Asia: An Overview   \u0406   31 \n\n \n \n\nFigure 25: Share of Informal Sector in Non-agricultural Employment \n \n\n%\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nAZE\n\nTHA\n\nARM\n\nKYR\n\nINO\n\nSRI\n\nCAM\n\nVIE\n\nPAK\n\nIND\n\n \n\nARM = Armenia; AZE = Azerbaijan; CAM = Cambodia; IND = India; INO = Indonesia; KYR = Kyrgyz Republic; PAK = Pakistan;  \nSRI = Sri Lanka; THA = Thailand; VIE = Viet Nam. \n\nSources: International Labour Organization (2011),  Key Indicators of the Labour Market, 7th edition; Asian Development Bank \n(2005),  Key Indicators.   \n \n \n\nOne factor which may well drive the link between services and the informal sector is the \nimportance of both in providing jobs in urban areas, especially in low-income economies or at \nthe early stages of urbanization. Many urban  migrants settle for informal sector work because \ntheir  low  skills  and  limited  education  constitute  a  major  barrier  in  finding  jobs  in  the  formal \nsector.  It  is  easier  for  poor  urban  migrants  to  find  work  in  simple  service  sector  jobs  such  as \nstreet  vendor,  peddler,  and  small  shop  assistant,  unlike  in  manufacturing  where  a  minimum \nlevel  of  skill  is  required  to  become  a  machine  operator  or  a  worker  in  the  production  line.  At \nsubstantially  high  income  levels  though,  the  importance  of  informal  sector  diminishes  (ADB \n2005), while that of service sector in general rises even more. \n\n \n \n\n \n\nX. QUALITY OF DATA: A MAJOR PROBLEM IN THE ANALYSIS OF ASIAN SERVICES \n\nIt  would  be  desirable  to  focus  the  discussion  on  a  more  narrowly  defined  range  of  services \nrelatively suitable to liberalization and clear economic linkage to the performance of the rest of \nthe  economy  such  as  \u201cbusiness  services.\u201d  What  one  immediately  confronts,  however,  is  the \ndearth of data. Indeed, one of the central messages of this study is the need to greatly expand \nefforts  at  basic  data  collection\u2014one  cannot  manage  what  one  cannot  measure.  This  is  an \nactivity that the Asian Development Bank is ideally positioned to support.  \n \n\nTable 5 summarizes data available for developing Asian economies, based on a survey \nof  the  countries\u2019  bureaus  of  statistics  and  labor.  It  may  well  be  incomplete  and  we  would \nwelcome identification of missing sources. Nevertheless, even interpreted as an incomplete first \npass,  it  is  cautioning.  There  is  a  tendency  for  occupational  employment  and  wage  data  to  be \navailable at finer levels of disaggregation than sectoral output or value-added data which in turn \nis  reported  with  greater  granularity  than  the  international  transactions  data.  This  unevenness \nappears to be at least in part a function of bureaucratic tasking, with labor ministries tending to \n\n\f32   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 320 \n \n \ntake  the  lead  on  employment  data,  economics  or  industry  ministries  the  output  data,  and  the \nfinance  ministry  or  central  bank  the  international  transactions  data.  Greater  coordination  and \nconsistency across reporting sources could improve the usefulness of this data. \n\nTable 5: Available Services Data in Selected Developing Asia Economies \n \nEconomic Data on Services \n\nTypes of Data \n\nServices Value Added \nGDP by Sector \nExports & Imports of Services by Sector \nGDP by Sector \nNet Domestic Product by Sector \nClassification of Output/Value Added by Sector \nService Industry Survey (Sales, # of establishments, \nEmployment) \nGDP by Sector \nRevenue/Expenses by Sector/Occupation \nValue of Fixed Assets by Sector/Occupation \n\nGDP by Sector \nValue Added by Sector \nNumber of Establishments by Sector \n\nTaipei,China \n\nGDP by Sector \n\nEmployment Data on Services \n\nChina, People's Rep. of \n\nHong Kong, China \n\nAverage Wages by Sector \nEmployment by Sector \nAverage Wages by Sector \nEmployment by Sector \n\nTypes of Data \n\n  \nSelected Asian \nEconomies \n\nChina, People's Rep. of \n\nHong Kong, China \n\n \n\n \n\nIndia \n\nKorea, Rep. of \n\nMalaysia \n\nPhilippines \n\nSingapore \n\n  \nSelected Asian \nEconomies \n\nIndia \n\nKorea, Rep. of \n\nMalaysia \n\nPhilippines \n\nSingapore \n\nTaipei,China \n\nEmployment by Sector \nEmployee Compensation by Sector \nAverage Wages by Sector \nEmployment by Sector \nEmployment by Sector/Occupation \nTotal Wages by Sector/Occupation \nEmployment by Occupation \nEmployment by Sector \nEmployment by Occupation \nEmployment by Sector \nEmployment by Sector \nWages by Sector \n\nLevel of Disaggregation \nin Services \n13 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n10 \n10 \n\nYears Available\n2005\u2013present \n1978\u2013present \n2006\u2013present \n2005\u2013present \n2005\u2013present \n2000\u2013present \n\n6 \n12 \n37 \n37 \n\n6 \n7 \n7 \n\n5 \n\n1996\u20132007 \n1985\u2013present \n1971\u20132007 \n1971\u20132007 \n\n2009\u2013present \n2004\u2013present \n2004\u2013present \n\n1986\u2013present \n\nLevel of Disaggregation \nin Services \n14 \n14 \n6 \n6 \nFull 4-digit Indian NIC \nCoding System \n10 \n12 \n17 \n37 \n37 \n17 \n11 \n25 \n12 \n55 \n55 \n\nYears Available\n2003\u2013present \n2003\u2013present \n2005\u2013present \n2005\u2013present \n\n2010 \n2000\u2013present \n2011 \n2004\u2013present \n1971\u20132007 \n1971\u20132007 \n1990\u2013present \n2001\u20132009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2011 \n2011 \n\nGDP = gross domestic product, NIC = National Industrial Classification. \n\nSources: Included countries' bureaus of labor and statistics; Authors' compilation. \n\n \nAs an illustrative example, Malaysian data are reported in table 6.

SOME CONCEPTUAL ISSUES \n\nIn  this  section,  we  explore  a  couple  of  conceptual  issues  pertaining  to  service  sector \ndevelopment  in  Asia.  First,  we  explore  the  relative  role  of  manufacturing  and  services  in  the \ngrowth  and  development  in  Asian  countries.  Second,  we  examine  the  links  between  services \nproductivity  and  productivity  in  other  sectors  of  the  economy,  especially  industry.  Finally,  we \ntake a quick look at the potential contribution of service sector development to inclusive growth \nin Asia, along with the role of Asian governments in fostering more dynamic service sectors. \n \nA. \n\nThe Either-Manufacturing-or-Services Fallacy \n \n\nSome  Asian  countries,  most  notably  India,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  the  Philippines,  have \nsucceeded in leveraging ICT and other new technologies to boost services exports and growth. \nSome point to the experiences of those countries as evidence that services-led growth offers a \nviable alternative growth and development strategy to the traditional manufacturing-led growth. \nAccording  to  this  line  of  reasoning,  technological  progress  allows  countries  to  leapfrog \nindustrialization  and  move  straight  into  the  post-industrial  phase.  Regardless  of  the  validity  of \nthe  leapfrogging  hypothesis\u2014and  clearly  there  are  alternative  pathways  to  development\u2014\nframing  growth  and  development  strategy  as  a  matter  of  either  manufacturing  or  services  is  a \ndangerous fallacy (Leamer 1987).\u00a0The leapfrogging hypothesis is dangerous because it can be \nmisused  as  an  excuse  for  the  failures  of  the  manufacturing  sector.  It  is  no  accident  that  the \nadvocates  of  leapfrogging  tend  to  highlight  countries  which  have  failed  to  develop  a  strong \nmanufacturing  sector\u2014e.g.,  the  Philippines.  While  India  has  often  been  hailed  as  the  poster \nchild of services-led growth, in fact the manufacturing sector has grown rapidly and contributed \nsignificantly to growth. Although we should not downplay the ICT-BPO industry\u2019s contributions, \nthe  industry\u2019s  output  and  employment  are  nowhere  near  enough  to  carry  India\u2019s  growth  on  its \nown. \n\n \nUpon  closer  reflection,  framing  Asian  countries\u2019  growth  and  development  strategy  in \nterms of either  manufacturing or services is not very  meaningful because it is necessary for a \ncountry to have both manufacturing and service sectors. Indeed while the relative importance of \nthe two sectors evolve over time, they both account for a large share of output and employment \nin most countries in Asia and elsewhere, and development is likely to be maximized when they \nmove  forward  together  symbiotically.  The  real  challenge  for  Asian  countries  is  to  address  the \nstructural and policy impediments which stand in the way of efficient manufacturing and service \nsectors.  For  example,  in  the  case  of  India,  augmenting  the  quantity  and  quality  of  its  subpar \nphysical infrastructure will boost the productivity of its manufacturing sector. \n\n \nIn countries where the industrialization process has not run its course\u2014and most of Asia \nfalls in this category\u2014the productivity of the manufacturing sector remains low. This implies that \nthe  sector  will  remain  a  key  driver  of  growth  and  jobs  for  years  to  come,  especially  under  a \nsound institutional and policy environment. It is more fruitful to look at comparative advantage \nfrom  a  dynamic  perspective.  While  it  is  tempting  to  write  off  the  industrialization  prospects  of, \nsay,  the  Philippines,  we  should  remember  that  comparative  advantage  evolves  over  time.  In \naddition,  both  services  and  manufacturing  are  far  from  monolithic  and  include  a  wide,  diverse \n\n\f \n\nDeveloping the Service Sector as Engine of Growth for Asia: An Overview   \u0406   35 \n\n \n \nrange  of  industries.  Therefore,  there  are  likely  to  be  some  industries  in  both  sectors  where  a \ncountry  may  have  a  comparative  advantage.  While  ICT  and  other  new  technologies  have \nopened  up  a  lot  of  new  possibilities  for  the  service  sector,  especially  by  improving  their \ntradability, a good balance between services and manufacturing remains the most viable growth \nstrategy for Asian countries. \n\nB. \n\n \nSynergies Between Services and Industrial Productivity \n \n\nThe service sector plays an important role in raising the productivity of the manufacturing sector \nand other sectors of the economy. This particularly applies to business services, as they provide \nkey intermediate inputs such as finance, legal services, human resource recruitment, marketing, \nand  information  technology  to  manufacturing  and  other  sectors.  Rather  than  handling  tasks \nrelated  to  business  services  internally,  manufacturing  firms  may  find  it  more  cost-efficient  to \noutsource  these  tasks  to  firms  that  specialize  in  them.  Increasing  fragmentation  of  business \nprocesses  and  the  corresponding  growth  of  the  global  business  process  outsourcing  industry \nindicate how outsourcing, including offshoring, of service functions has become an integral part \nof  running  a  viable  and  competitive  business.  By  unloading  some  tasks  to  specialized  service \nproviders, manufacturing companies can concentrate on their core activities, and on improving \nproduction  and  undertaking  innovation  and  technological  upgrade.  The  important  synergies \nbetween  services  and  industry  become  more  apparent  as  economies  develop,  produce  more \ndifferentiated  goods,  and  require  more  efficient  systems  for  businesses.  As  a  very  rough \nmeasure of synergies between services and industry, we take a look at the correlation between \nlabor productivity in the two sectors. Figure 26 reveals that there is a high degree of correlation \nbetween  services  productivity  and  industrial  productivity.  While  the  correlation  is  likely  to \nprimarily  reflect  factors  which  affect  labor  productivity  of  both  industry  and  services\u2014e.g., \nhuman capital and physical infrastructure\u2014the strength of the correlation suggests the presence \nof at least some synergies between labor productivity in the two sectors as well.  \n\n \n \n\nFigure 26: Correlation of Productivity in Services and Industry, Late 2000s \n(2000 constant $) \n\nDeveloping Asia\n\nRest of the world\n\n120,000\n\n90,000\n\n60,000\n\n30,000\n\n0\n\ni\n\nS\ne\nr\nv\nc\ne\ns\n \np\nr\no\nd\nu\nc\nt\ni\nv\ni\nt\ny\n\n \n\n0\n\n20,000\n\n40,000\n\n100,000\n\n120,000\n\n140,000\n\n60,000\n80,000\nIndustry productivity\n\nNote: Data from 2005 to 2010. \n\nSource: World Bank, World Development Indicators online data base (accessed 16 April 2012). \n\n\f36   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 320 \n \n \n\nA  limited  set  of  studies  have  examined  the  links  between  the  service  sector  and  other \nsectors.  The  studies  broadly  indicate  the  critical  role  of  the  service  sector  in  lifting  economy-\nwide productivity. Francois and Hoekman (2010) have surveyed some studies that explore the \nimpact  of  the  service  sector  on  the  rest  of  the  economy.  They  cite  studies  that  indicate  the \nimportance of services in raising aggregate productivity, as well as in explaining differences in \naggregate  productivity  levels  and  growth  rates  across  countries.  A  study  by  Pilat  and  W\u00f6lfl \n(2005)  indicates  how  services  provide  key  contributions  to  production,  through  its  direct \ncontribution to total output and final demand, as well as through provision of intermediate inputs. \nFurther, the growing interdependence between services and manufacturing is seen in the rising \namount of service sector value added being embodied in manufacturing goods. The relationship \nbetween  service  sector  size  and  productivity  and  living  standards  is  examined  in  a  study  by \nEichengreen  and  Gupta  (2009).  They  find  a  positive  correlation  between  output  share  of \nservices and income per capita, but such a relationship holds only for service activities that are \neither a combination of traditional and modern services consumed mainly by households such \nas  education  and  health,  or  modern  services,  intended  for  both  households  and  businesses. \nFurther,  their  study  finds  that  modern  services  not  only  have  the  highest  productivity  growth \namong  the  service  industries,  but  their  share  in  output  tends  to  rise  rapidly  at  high  income \nlevels.  \n \nC. \n\nService Sector Development, Inclusive Growth, and the Role of Government \n \n\nUp to now, Asia relied largely on the trickle-down effect to spread the fruits of economic growth. \nThe implicit assumption behind the trickle-down effect is that growth itself, especially under the \ntype  of  sustained  rapid  growth  which  Asia  enjoyed,  would  somehow  automatically  benefit  the \nentire  population,  at  least  after  some  time  lag.  This  assumption  is  not  entirely  without  basis\u2014\nearly resource-scarce industrializers of East Asia, most notably the PRC; the Republic of Korea, \nand Taipei,China\u2014did in fact experience \u201cgrowth with equity\u201d to a remarkable degree. But this \nachievement  was  linked,  at  least  in  part,  to  specific  characteristics,  including  high  ratios  of \npopulation to arable land, recovery from warfare, and productivity-boosting land reforms that are \nunlikely to be generally reproducible elsewhere (Noland and Pack 2003). \n\n \nHowever,  in  recent  years,  Asia  has  witnessed  a  growing  popular  demand  for  inclusive \ngrowth, which involves more of the population in the growth process and directly distributes the \nfruits  of  growth  more  widely.  Two  key  ingredients  of  inclusive  growth  are  expanded  access  to \neducation and productive employment. Services tend to be labor-intensive so they play a vital \nrole  in  generating  productive  employment  opportunities.  Therefore,  at  a  broader  level,  service \nsector development can promote inclusive growth by creating jobs. Crucially, these include not \nonly jobs in the modern service industries but also jobs in the traditional service industries. \n\n \nWe  should  avoid  generalizing  about  the  job-creating  capacity  of  manufacturing  versus \nservices since both are heterogeneous. Some manufacturing industries tend to be more labor-\nintensive than others, and the same is true for services. As noted earlier, East and Southeast \nAsian countries were able to leverage their ample supply of labor by investing in labor-intensive \nmanufacturing  industries.  Nevertheless,  intuitively,  general  manufacturing  requires  a  larger \nstock of physical capital\u2014i.e., factories and machines\u2014than services and is thus more skewed \ntoward capital than services. Capital is typically held by the wealthy few while even the poor are \nendowed  with  unskilled  labor.  A  shift  in  economic  structure  toward  services  can  thus  help  to \nreduce  poverty  and  inequality.  The  evidence  resoundingly  confirms  that  services have  been  a \nmajor source of jobs in Asia. In addition, there is some evidence that services development can \nreduce  poverty.  Finally,  intuitively,  services  development  may  also  be  beneficial  for  gender \nequality.  \n\n\f \n\nDeveloping the Service Sector as Engine of Growth for Asia: An Overview   \u0406   37 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nThe  policy  question  now  facing  Asian  governments  is:  What  activist  policies  can  they \npursue  to  stimulate  the  growth  of  the  service  sector,  beyond  the  standard  litany  of  enabling \nreforms?  These  include  easing  entry  to  boost  completion,  reducing  the  regulatory  burden, \nimproving  access  to  capital,  especially  for  entrepreneurs  and  small-  and  medium-sized \nenterprises,  reducing  taxation  on  labor,  and  increasing  the  flexibility  to  labor  markets  more \ngenerally,  equalizing  tax  treatment  across  sectors  where  manufacturing  activities  are  often \ntreated preferentially. One area where active government intervention can make a big difference \nis  ICT  infrastructure,  especially  broadband.  ICT  has  large  spillover  effects  on  services  and \nserved  as  a  catalyst  in  transforming  nontradable  services  into  tradable  services.  Telecom \nliberalization which brings down telecom service prices is a key in this context. With respect to \nefficiency of public services and utilities, privatization has largely fallen out of favor but fostering \nmore competitive markets remains the more basic challenge. \n\nXII. CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS \n\nAsia\u2019s  sustained  rapid  growth  has  been  fueled  to  a  large  extent  by  export-oriented \nindustrialization.  This  is  especially  true  for  East  and  Southeast  Asian  economies  which  have \ncollectively become the factory of the world. High savings and investment rates, in some cases \naugmented by large FDI inflows, allowed for a rapid buildup of physical capital stock. Openness \nto foreign technology and large workforces further expanded the capacity of those countries to \nmake  and  export  goods.  The  manufacturing  sectors  of  the  region  are  woven  together  into  a \nregional  production  network  in  which  different  countries  specialize  in  different  parts  of  the \nproduction  process,  further  boosting  productive  efficiency  and  the  region\u2019s  role  as  a  global \nmanufacturing  hub.  Reallocation  of  labor  from  low-productivity  agriculture  to  high-productivity \nmanufacturing  underlay  the  region\u2019s  sustained  rapid  growth.  This  labor-intensive,  export-\noriented, manufacturing-based growth paradigm delivered the best of both worlds\u2014growth with \njobs\u2014for Asia. \n \nThere  are  a  number  of  structural  and  external  factors  which  compromise  this  growth \nparadigm.  Above  all,  manufacturing  is  now  maturing  and  its  productivity  levels  have  reached \nhigh  levels  in  many  Asian  countries.  The  clearest  proof  of  this  is  Asia\u2019s  role  as  a  global \nmanufacturing  hub.  As  manufacturing  matures,  its  productivity  improves,  its  capacity  to \ngenerate  employment  attenuates, and  the  scope  for  further  productivity  growth  grows  smaller. \nSince service industries tend to be labor-intensive, vitalizing service industries thus assumes an \neven  greater  importance  in  Asian  employment.  Therefore,  Asia\u2019s  future  growth  will  depend \nincreasingly  on  raising  productivity  in  the  service  sector,  but  productivity  gains  in  services  are \nhard  to  come  by.  Externally,  the  post-global  crisis  moderation  of  growth  in  the  advanced \neconomies  calls  for  domestic  demand\u2014and  hence  services  which  cater  largely  to  domestic \ndemand\u2014to contribute more to Asia\u2019s future growth. \n\nto  manufacturing\u2014haircuts  versus  automobiles\u2014does  not  diminish \n\n \nThe  sheer  heterogeneity  of  the  service  sector,  and  inherent  difficulty  of  measuring  its \noutput  relative \nits \nsignificance. In the lower-income countries of Asia, traditional services account for much of the \nservice  sector  whereas  in  the  higher-income  countries,  modern  services  play  a  bigger  role. \nSuch  diversity  of  Asian  countries\u2019  service  sectors  necessarily  means  that  each  country  faces \ndifferent priorities in service sector development, but strengthening modern services remains a \ncommon region-wide challenge. The intangible nature of many services does not take anything \naway from their very real economic effects, especially in employment but also broader economic \ndynamism. In addition, there are potentially large synergies between services on one hand and \nmanufacturing  and  the  rest  of  the  economy  on  the  other.  For  example,  efficient  energy, \n\n\f38   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 320 \n \n \ntransportation  and  distribution  networks  boost  the  productivity  of  the  manufacturing  sector.  A \nstrong modern service sector, in particular, business services such as design, prototyping and \nmarketing,  can  move  middle-income  Asian  countries  up  the  value  chain  toward  higher  value-\nadded activities and thus help them escape the much-feared middle income trap. \n\n \nOur overview of Asia\u2019s service sector indicates that it already accounts for a large share \nof  the  region\u2019s  output  and  employment.  This  is  hardly  surprising  since  the  industrialization \nprocess,  during  which  the  share  of  output  and  employment  in  both  services  and  industry \ntypically  rise  at  the  expense  of  agriculture,  is  under  way  in  most  of  Asia,  including  its  poorer, \nless developed economies. Furthermore, the growth of the service sector has already made a \nsizable contribution to the region\u2019s economic growth. We also find some evidence that service \nsector development can lower poverty in a region which still remains home to almost two-thirds \nof the world\u2019s poor despite a great deal of progress. At the same time, our overview indicates \nthat  there  is  plenty  of  scope  of  further  growth  and  development  for  Asia\u2019s  service  sector.  For \none, traditional services still account for a large share of Asia\u2019s service sector. Partly as a result, \nthe Asia\u2019s service sector lags far behind the OECD in terms of labor productivity. \n\n \nThe  gaping  productivity  gap  between  Asian  countries  and  OECD  economies  implies  a \nwide range of structural and policy impediments which must be removed in order for Asia to fully \nunleash the potential of the service sector as an engine of growth and jobs.  \n\n \nInternally,  these  include  the  strengthening  of  labor  and  capital  markets,  reform  of  tax \nregimes, and elimination of burdensome regulations which typically protect incumbent firms, and \nthus  stifle  competition  and  innovation  (see,  for  example,  W\u00f6lfl  et  al.  2010).  The  international \nhistorical experience shows that regulatory reforms often deliver significant economic benefits, \nsuch  as  higher  labor  productivity  and  lower  prices  (see,  for  example,  OECD  2005).\u00a0   External \nbarriers  such  as  barriers  to  trade  in  services  also  impede  competition  in  domestic  services \nmarkets. Reducing such barriers can not only promote efficiency and productivity in services but \nalso  contribute  directly  to  exports  and  growth\u2014e.g.,  India\u2019s  well-known  success  as  ICT-BPO \nexporter.  The  overall  guiding  principle  for  Asian  policymakers  must  be  to  create  a  more \ncompetitive environment for their service industries  \n \n\n\f \n\nREFERENCES \n \nADB  (Asian  Development  Bank).  2005.

However, the sector\u2019s productivity greatly lags that of the advanced \neconomies, which implies ample room for further growth.  The impact of the service sector  \non poverty reduction is less clear, but the paper finds some limited evidence of a poverty \nreduction effect. \n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the \nregion\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: 1.7 billion people who \nlive on less than $2 a day, with 828 million struggling on less than $1.25 a day.  ADB is committed \nto reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, \nand regional integration.\n \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region.
