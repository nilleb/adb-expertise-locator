INTRODUCTION \nThe Republic of Korea has been widely recognized for its rapid transformation from a \nwar-devastated nation into one of the 10 largest economies in the world. The main driving \nforces are said to have been factors such as the comprehensive development plans laid \nout by the central government and strong leadership; industry development and export-\ncentered policy; and foreign investment, high demand for education, and the diligence \nand solidarity of Koreans. Furthermore, investment in social overhead capital (SOC) \nacted as a catalyst for social and economic development. Of these, policies to address \nthe problems of chronic flooding and drought as well as the development of water \nresources to meet the country\u2019s ever-increasing demand acted as the backbone for its \nrapid economic development. Water policy and management started in the 1960s along \nwith the national economic development plans. Figure 1 shows the chronological water \nmanagement changes in the Republic of Korea. In the 1960s, a multipurpose dam \ndevelopment plan was set up by the central government, and several multipurpose dams \nand multi-water supply systems had been built by the 1990s. Since 2000, the water policy \nhas  increasingly  focused  on  efficiency  and  environment-friendliness  rather  than \ndevelopment or expansion. \nFigure 1: Water Management History in the Republic of Korea \n \nSource: Long-Term Comprehensive Water Resources Plan (2001\u20132020) \u2013 3rd revision, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure \nand Transport, 2016. \nAs shown in Figure 2, the central government built multipurpose dams and water \nresource infrastructure as laid out in the Comprehensive National Territorial Plan and the \nLong-Term  Comprehensive  Water  Resources  Plan.  These  acted  as  the  basis  for \nstimulating the country\u2019s economic development and were especially effective in the \nearly stages. One unit of water resource development increased gross domestic product \n(GDP) by 0.577 units in the early stages of development, whereas in the mature stages \nof development, GDP has increased by 0.214 (Choi et al. 2016). \nDeveloping  countries  tend  to  prioritize  investment  in  roads,  transportation, \ncommunication, and electricity ahead of water. However, water should also be regarded \nas a necessity both for the citizens\u2019 daily lives and industrial activities.  \nSystemized  laws,  institutions,  and  leadership  are  regarded  as  key  factors  for  the \nsuccessful development and maintenance of water resources in the Republic of Korea \n(see Araral and Yu 2013). \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 985  Lee \n \nFigure 2: Water Resources Development and Gross Domestic Product per Capita  \n \n1st (1972\u20131981), 2nd (1982\u20131991),  \nComprehensive National Territorial Plan \n3rd (1992\u20132001), 4th (2000\u20132020) \n1st (1966\u20131975), 2nd (1981\u20131991),  \nLong-Term Comprehensive Water Resources Plan  \n3rd (1991\u20132011), 4th (2001\u20132020) \nSource: Long-Term Comprehensive Water Resources Plan (2001\u20132020) \u2013 3rd revision, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure \nand Transport, 2016. \nRecently, there has been a remarkable paradigm shift in water-related policy and \ninstitutions in the country (see Araral and Yu 2013). For the integration of water resources \nmanagement, which encompasses water quantity, water quality, aqua-ecosystem, and \ndisaster prevention, among others, two main ministries related to the water management \nsector  were  combined.  On  28  May  2018,  the  national  congress  determined  that \ngovernment organizations at the central level would be reorganized, with the Ministry of \nEnvironment managing the water sector in an inclusive way in terms of both water \nquantity and water quality.  \n2.  STATUS OF WATER RESOURCES  \nWater resources in the Republic of Korea total 132.3 billion cubic meters (m3), of which \n76.0 billion m3 (57%) is available as shown in Figure 3. In 2014, total water use was 37.2 \nbillion  m3,  accounting  for  28%  of  total  water  resources.  Since  the  volume  of  \ntotal water use exceeds the amount of normal water runoff, which is measured during \nthe normal nonflood season, flood runoff needs to be reserved in impoundments. Among \nthe total amount of water uses, household, industry, and agriculture use amounts to \n25.1 billion m3 per year, approximately 33% of the available water resources. The water \nuse for households, industry, and agriculture are 7.6 billion m3, 2.3 billion m3, and 15.2 \nbillion m3, respectively.  \n   \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 985  Lee \n \nFigure 3: Water Resources Status in the Republic of Korea  \n(100 million m3 per year) \n \nm3 = cubic meter.  \nSource: Long-Term Comprehensive Water Resources Plan (2001\u20132020) \u2013 3rd revision, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure \nand Transport, 2016. \nBoth seasonal and regional variations are shown in respect to water availability in  \nthe Republic of Korea. Yearly average precipitation is 1,274 millimeters (1.6 times the \nworld average), more than half of which falls during a distinct rainy period (June to \nAugust), while winter precipitation is less than 10%. The rainy season brings frequent \nflash floods. In addition, the country\u2019s steep mountainous topography initiates high \nrunoffs and reduces opportunity for soil infiltration, therefore also contributing to flooding. \nRegional disparities in rainfall are quite stark: the south and northeast parts (Gangwon) \nof  the  country  experience  over  1,400  millimeters  of  rainfall  annually,  whereas  the \nsoutheast region (Gyeongsang including the so-called Central Nakdong River area) \nreceives less than 1,100 millimeters of rainfall.  \nThe Republic of Korea has had to adapt its water system to manage this variability  \nand to provide even access to water supplies across the country. This effort has \nmaterialized in the form of a sophisticated and extensive network of large, medium-sized, \nand small dams, irrigation facilities, and multiregional water systems aimed to provide \nwater supply for domestic, industrial, and agricultural uses; control river flows to prevent \nfloods and droughts; and generate hydroelectricity. It was progressively developed from \nthe 1980s to the early 2000s. \n3.  HISTORY OF WATER RESOURCES  \nMANAGEMENT POLICY  \nThe  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  water  policy  commenced  in  the  form  of  comprehensive  \nwater resources development projects starting with basin investigations in the 1960s \nafter the Korean War. The comprehensive development projects included large-scale \ndams and water control projects in major rivers in the 1970s and 1980s. The concept  \nof eco-friendly water resources management was born in the 1990s, and the focus  \non water supply and/or control moved to sustainable water management including  \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 985  Lee \n \nstream environment preservation in the 2000s. Since 2010, the policy has focused on \ncoping with climate change and advancing the water management system. The policy \nparadigm shift is shown in Figure 4. \nFigure 4: Water Management Paradigm Shift \n \nSource: K-water internal document. \n3.1  The 1960s: Beginning of Comprehensive Water  \nResources Development \n3.1.1  Establishment of Nationwide Water Resources Development  \nand Management System \nAs  the  government  accelerated  land  development  from  the  1960s  onward,  water \nresources development was promoted in full scale with the Ministry of Construction  \nas its foundation. In 1961, the first 5-year economic and social development plan  \nwas  compiled.  At  the  same  time,  river  improvement  with  an  annual  length  of  \n289.3 kilometers was promoted and a 4-year water control plan was established. \nThe River Act, enacted for river management of water control in 1961, has played a \nleading role in river management and water resources development so far. Meanwhile, \nthe 10-year Comprehensive Water Resources Development Plan (1966\u20131975) was \nestablished  to  promote  irrigation and  water control simultaneously.  In  particular,  a \nSpecial Multipurpose Dam Law was enacted in 1966, which assigned the task of \nmultipurpose dam construction to Korea Water Resources Development Corporation, \nthe apparatus to enforce the law. \n   \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 985  Lee \n \n3.1.2  Introduction of Multipurpose Dams and Implementation  \nof Basin Investigations \nConstruction of Seomjingang Multipurpose Dam, the first multipurpose dam in the \ncountry, was completed in 1965. The dam\u2019s main functions are flood control, hydropower \ngeneration,  and  water  supply.  In  addition,  a  large-scale  basin  investigation  was \nconducted that focused on the four major rivers (Hangang, Nakdonggang, Geumgang, \nand Yeongsangang). \nIn addition, approximately 190 agricultural reservoirs were built, and construction of \nhydropower  generation  facilities  started  in  this  period  as  well  to  utilize  water  and \nreclaimed water for self-sufficient food production, and to secure a power source for \nindustrialization. Construction of Uiam Dam, built exclusively for power generation, was \ncompleted in 1967. \n3.2  The 1970s: Settlement of Comprehensive  \nWater Resources Development \nThe Four River Basin Development Plan (1971\u20131981) was launched and linked to the \nFirst Comprehensive National Territorial Plan. In addition, a flood control policy was \nadopted along the four river basins. This was followed by construction of multipurpose \ndams. Following the plan, consistent development policy was adopted along each river \nbasin, such as working on river improvement and construction of estuary banks. The \nRiver Act was amended in 1971 to include the protection of the Vested Water Right. In \n1973, according to the 10-Year Water Resource Development Plan, Soyang River Dam \nwas constructed and became the largest multipurpose dam in the Eastern Region. The \nconstruction of other multipurpose dams such as Andong Dam and Daechung Dam \nfollowed. In 1979, as the first phase of developing the Seoul metropolitan area, a \nmultiregional water supply system was constructed to ensure stable supply of both \ndomestic and industrial water. \n3.3  The 1980s: Advancement of Comprehensive  \nWater Resources Development \nAccording to the establishment of the Comprehensive Water Resource Development \nPlan (1981\u20132001) in 1980, multipurpose dams including Chungju Dam, Imha Dam, \nHapcheon  Dam,  Juam  Dam,  and  Namgang  Dam  were  constructed.  In  addition, \nmultiregional water supply systems were also promoted in Seoul, the surrounding area, \nand other regions. At the same time, estuaries in the four rivers were completed. During \nthis  period,  water  usage  rapidly  increased  (tripled  from  5.1  billion  m3  in  1965  \nto  15.3  billion  m3  in  1980)  as  a  result  of  economic  development.  In  addition,  \n249 agricultural reservoirs were constructed to secure water supply. As the necessity  \nof  water  quality  management  became  more  prominent,  the  Korean  Environment \nDepartment was established in the early 1980s. It started working on water quality \nmanagement in the public water sector.  \n   \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 985  Lee \n \n3.4  The 1990s: Application of Environment-Friendly  \nWater Management \nSince  the  Long-Term  Comprehensive  Water  Resources  Plan  (1991\u20132011)  was \nestablished in 1990, small and medium-scale multipurpose dams were built, such as \nHoengseong Dam, Miryang Dam, Buan Dam, Boryeong Dam, Jangheung Dam, and \nYongdam Dam. In addition, water demand for industrial and urban areas was met \nthrough the construction of multipurpose dams (10 dams, around 3.7 billion m3 scale, \nand 600 gigawatt-hours of power generation) and the expansion of multiregional water \nsupply systems (26 facilities, 10 million m3 scale). However, media reports highlighted \nthe incidents of phenol contamination and organic solvents in the Nakdong River,  \nand water quality became a prominent social issue nationwide. In the aftermath of the \nincidents,  the  Korean  Environment  Department  was  expanded  to  the  Ministry  \nof  Environment,  and  water  and  wastewater  works  belonging  to  the  Ministry  of \nConstruction  were  transferred  to  the  Ministry  of  Environment.  In  addition,  disaster \nprevention service works were transferred to the Ministry of Government Administration \nand Interior Affairs (currently the Ministry of Interior and Safety). In 1999, the Basic Plan \non River Maintenance was included in the River Environment Plan through the overall \nrevision of the River Act, and environment-friendly construction methods and river \nmaintenance flow concepts were adopted. \n3.5  The 2000s: Paradigm Shift \nDuring the shift from supply-oriented quantitative development to a diversified qualitative \npolicy focusing on water quality, ecology, and the environment, dam development \ndecreased and the importance of water quality and the environment was emphasized. \nAccordingly, alternative water resource development increased. The government strove \nto reach social consensus by operating water-related councils with related ministries, \nsocial societies, and private experts. In 2000, the construction of Yeongwol Dam was \ncanceled and the construction of environment-friendly small and medium-sized dams \nincluding Pyeonlim Dam, Gunwi Dam, Buhang Dam, and Gampo Dam as well as the \nredevelopment of Seongdeok Dam were promoted. \n3.6  The 2010s: Adapting to Climate Change \nIn 2011, the second revision of the Long-Term Comprehensive Water Resources Plan \nwas conducted to secure water resource for addressing climate change and supporting \nthe water industry. In addition, the Four River Restoration Project and the Gyeong-in Ara \nWaterway Project were completed. The plan for conservation and utilization of riverside \nspaces was established by reflecting the opinions of all stakeholders through transparent \ngovernance. \n4.  WATER-RELATED ORGANIZATIONS AND LAWS  \nThe Republic of Korea\u2019s water management system can be described as centralized and \ndiversified.  In  its  early  stages  of  development,  organizations  closely  related  to \ndevelopment and quantitative growth oversaw decision making and implementation. This \nwas also true for water management departments. However, as the water management \nparadigm changed over time, its organizational structure also changed to be able to \nimplement new policies. On 28 May 2018, the Korean Parliament approved the revision \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 985  Lee \n \nof three water management laws, resulting in drastic changes to the water management \norganizational structure of the central government. \nTo better understand the background and direction of the 2018 restructuring, this section \nwill focus on the organizational structure that existed beforehand. \n4.1  Organizational Status before 28 May 2018 \n4.1.1  Central Government Level \nIn general, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport was in charge of water \nquantity management, whereas the Ministry of Environment was in charge of water \nquality  management.  Water  has  been  traditionally  perceived  as  a  public  good  in  \nthe Republic of Korea. Hence, it is generally accepted that the government takes \nresponsibility  for  managing  water  resources.  In  general,  the  Ministry  of  Land, \nInfrastructure  and  Transport  manages  water  quantity,  whereas  the  Ministry  of \nEnvironment manages water quality. More specifically, multiple ministries are engaged \nin water management, but no overarching control tower that oversees and coordinates \nfunctions and businesses exists. The principal roles of each ministry in relation to  \nwater management (pre-2018 restructuring) are listed in Table 1, and those of public \ninstitutes in Table 2. \nTable 1: Water-Related Organizations \nMinistry  MOLIT  ME  MAFRA  MOIS  MOTIE \nPolicy  \u2022 Comprehensive  \u2022 Water  \u2022 Agricultural  \u2022 Disaster  \u2022 Power \nwater resources  conservation  water plan  prevention  development \ndevelopment  plan  plan  plan \n \nResource  \u2022 River  \u2022 Drinking spring  \u2022 Agricultural  \u2022 Hot springs \nManagement  management  water  reservoirs  \u2022 Small \n\u2022 Flood control  management  \u2022 Groundwater  rivers \n\u2022 Reservoir  quantity and \nmanagement  quality \n\u2022 Groundwater  management \nquantity  in rural areas \nmanagement \n \nBusiness  \u2022 Multipurpose dam  \u2022 Local water  \u2022 Irrigation  \u2022 Hydropower \nconstruction and  (retail)  water (dam)  \u2022 Small-scale \nmanagement  management  \u2022 Agricultural  hydropower \n\u2022 Multiregional  \u2022 Water reuse  dam \nsupply system  \u2022 Sewage  construction \nconstruction and  systems  \u2022 Groundwater \nmanagement  development \n     \nEvaluation/  \u2022 Hydrological data  \u2022 Drinking water \nObservation  observation  quality \n\u2022 Groundwater \nquality \nMAFRA = Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs; ME = Ministry of Environment; MOIS = Ministry of the Interior \nand Safety; MoLIT = Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport; MoSF = Ministry of Strategy and Finance;  \nMOTIE = Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. \nSource: Author. \n   \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 985  Lee \n \nTable 2: Public Institutes Associated with Water Management \nMinistry  Institute  Main Responsibilities \nMOLIT  Regional  \u2022 Responsible for national river management as an administrative \nConstruction  body  \nManagement Office  \u2022 Five regional offices exist by province  \n\u2022 Oversees the maintenance and management of national rivers and \ndevelops and implements the action plan \n\u2022 Checks construction status and manages safety of water facilities \nin the region \nK-water  \u2022 Responsible for construction, operation, and management of \nvarious water development facilities including multipurpose dams, \nNakdong estuary bank, weirs, and canal facilities \n\u2022 Mitigates the effects of droughts and floods  \n\u2022 Responsible for the construction, operation, and management of \nmultiregional water supply systems  \n\u2022 Constructs, operates, and manages sewage treatment facilities \nwhen they are government or local government investments \n\u2022 Operates local waterworks under consignment agreements with \nlocal governments \n\u2022 Produces and supplies renewable energies such as hydropower \nand tidal power \nMAFRA  KRC   \u2022 Develops and supplies agricultural water \n\u2022 KRC supplies 524,000 ha and local government supply 254,000 ha \nof agricultural water for 778,000 ha of irrigated paddies nationwide \nME  Regional  \u2022 There are four environmental management offices by river basin \nEnvironmental  which are in charge of managing and conserving the environment \nManagement  around its river basin. \nOffices \nKECO  \u2022 Responsible for technical assistance and diagnosis of operating \nwaste management systems, installation and operation of waste \nrecycling facilities, and operation and management of \nenvironmental pollution monitoring  \n\u2022 Develops sewerage policies and support projects, water reuse \npolicies, integrated operation of local waterworks and water \nnetworks improvement projects, construction and operation of \nautomatic water quality measurement, and installation of remote \nwater monitoring and control systems \nMOTIE  KHNP  \u2022 Currently operating 10 hydropower plants (Hwacheon, Chuncheon, \nAnheung, EuiAm, Chungphyung, Paldang, Bosung River, \nGangreung, Guisan hydroelectric, and Seomjin River) \n\u2022 In June 2016, the government decided to unify the operations and \nmanagement of hydropower dams for efficient water management. \nThe hydropower dams managed by KHNP will be operated in \nconjunction with K-water\u2019s multipurpose dams in terms of discharge \nquantity and dam water level. \nha = hectare; KECO = Korea Environment Corporation; KHNP = Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Corporation;  \nKRC = Korea Rural Community Corporation; MAFRA = Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs; ME = Ministry  \nof Environment; MOIS = Ministry of the Interior and Safety; MoLIT = Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport; MoSF \n= Ministry of Strategy and Finance; MOTIE = Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. \nSource: Author. \n4.1.2  Private Sector \nPrivate sector participation has been encouraged since the early 1990s.

qualitative management of \nwater resources increased. There has been criticism in the Republic of Korea on the \nsubdivision of laws and administrative laws, of which there are 20 and 47, respectively, \nby  ministry.  This  resulted  in  the  overlapping  of  plans  and  created  problems  as  \nregards effective use of budgets. Furthermore, the disconnection between qualitative \nmanagement  policies  and  quantitative  management  policies  resulted  in  failure  of \ncomprehensive  management  of  watershed  environments  and  ecosystems.  Without \nconsideration of water quality, ecosystems, and demand management, sustainable \nsupply and effective disaster management were impossible. This was especially so \nbecause optimal operations limited consideration of water quality and quantity by river \nsections due to the dry stream phenomenon.  \n4.2  Rearrangement of Water Institutions on 28 May 2018 \nAs mentioned earlier, water management in the Republic of Korea involves the Ministry \nof Environment (local waterworks and wastewater treatment), the Ministry of Land, \nInfrastructure  and  Transport  (dams,  multiregional  waterworks  and  rivers),  and  the \nMinistry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (agricultural water). \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 985  Lee \n \nAs  a  result,  there  are  some  side  effects  such  as  duplication  of  construction  and \nmanagement  between  government  departments,  waste  of  budget,  and  overlap  \nof  regulations.  For  a  long  time,  there  has  been  a  need  for  unification  of  water \nmanagement work and management of integrated water resources.  \nOn 28 May 2018, the Korean National Assembly finally passed the revised bill of the \nGovernment Organization Act and established the Water Management Basic Act. The \namendments to the Government Organization Act included the transfer of duties related \nto conservation, utilization, and development of water resources in the Ministry of Land, \nInfrastructure and Transport, except river management, to the Ministry of Environment. \nThe measures to unify a large part of the water management work centered on the \nMinistry of Environment are expected to mitigate inefficiency and strengthen water \nmanagement capacity through the integrated management of water quality and water \nquality. \nThe Basic Law of Water Management regulates basic concepts of water management \nand aims to sustain the water cycle system through securing water supply, conserving \nthe water environment, and preventing water disasters such as droughts and floods, and \nfinally to contribute to improving the quality of life of the people. In addition, it regulates \nthe setting up of the water management committee, which will establish the basic \nprinciples of water management, such as water as a public good, water cycle, ecological \nenvironment conservation, watershed management, and integrated water resources \nmanagement, and deliberate and make decisions on important matters regarding water \nmanagement. \nAccording to the act, a water management committee will be set up at the national and \nbasin levels. Every 10 years, the Ministry of Environment should establish a basic water \nmanagement plan after discussing with the heads of the relevant central governments \nand the chairs of the basin management committee. \nThe Water Management Basic Act is of great significance, because it acts as the \nsupreme  law  related  to  water,  thereby  resolving  conflicts  and  related  disputes.  In \nparticular, it is expected to be able to suppress wasting budget, and to regulate the \nconflicts or different interests among the diverse ministries that manage respectively \nwater quantity, water quality, agricultural water, and water-related disasters. In this \ncontext, the water management functions of the government have been transferred from \nthe Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport to the Ministry of Environment. \nIn  order  to  streamline  water  management  and  resolve  water-related  issues  such  \nas  water  disasters,  the  National  Water  Management  Committee  and  Watershed \nManagement Committee are to be established and operated (in June 2019). The Ministry \nof Environment plans to integrate and manage the local water supply system on a \nwatershed basis. In addition, it plans to eliminate droughts by developing and supplying \nwater  resources  tailored  to  local  conditions  (for  example,  sewage  reuse,  leakage \nreduction project). It also plans to strengthen forecasts and response to water disasters \nsuch as urban flooding. \n5.  WATER SERVICES \nMultiregional water supply systems operated by K-water and local water supply systems \noperated by local governments are two main water services in the Republic of Korea \n(Table 4).

CASE STUDY: SMART WATER MANAGEMENT  \n7.1  Paju Smart Water City \nA Smart Water City (SWC) project was conducted in Paju City, a municipality where \n390,000 out of a total population of 410,000 are connected to the water supply. Here, K-\nwater in 2014 built a smart water management system that supplies safe water from the \nsource to the customer by improving the stability and efficiency of the supply based on \nscientific management, using information and communication technology (ICT). The \nproject has enabled the citizens of Paju to check the water quality in their neighborhood \nand  homes  in  real  time  using  a  water  quality  signboard  and  a  smartphone  app.  \nThe provision includes a water coordinator service whereby staff directly check the water \nquality from the tap, and a water doctor service whereby staff directly check the condition \nof indoor water pipes and clean them. As a result, civil complaints have decreased from \n4.5 to 1.3 cases per month, and the average tap-water drinking rate has increased from \n1% (before the SWC project commenced) to 41.5% after implementation. Consumer \ndissatisfaction of tap-water quality has been allayed, and the overall satisfaction of water \nservices was greatly improved (Figure 8). \nFigure 8: Performance of Smart Water City \n \nSource: K-water document. \nAt a time when it is necessary to respond to water crises caused by both rapid economic \ndevelopment and climate change, the Republic of Korea is responding by integrating ICT \ninto water management. Smart water management creates a new paradigm of innovative \nwater management such that it can improve water security and welfare by addressing \nglobal water issues and the imperative of sustainable water usage. With those goals in \nmind,  and  in  partnership  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  K-water  is  providing \ntechnical assistance in the application of smart water management to countries such as \nBangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka. \n   \n17 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 985  Lee \n \n7.2  Seosan Smart Water Management \nOne of the most important tasks for Korean water supply services at present is to \nminimize the amount of leakage and to supply consistently safe water to users. Smart \nwater management (SWM) technology is therefore essential as it allows operators to use \nreal-time information to cope with such challenges. SWM combines various technologies \nsuch as information and communication technology (ICT) systems, Supervisory Control \nand Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, smart meters, and other devices to ensure \nstability and efficiency throughout the network. SWM specifies technologies and creates \nstandards for the overall water circulation system. Examples of applications include \nSmart  Water  Grid  (SWG),  Smart  Water  City  (SWC),  Integrated  Water  Quality \nForecasting System (SUIRAN), and Integrated Water Management System (K-HIT). \nFigure 9: District and Subdistrict Metered Areas \n \nSource: K-water document. \nA smart meter enables the transmission of information concerning consumer tap-water \nusage  measured  by  time.  The  use  of  digital  meters  and  Internet  of  Things  (IoT) \ntechnology as an alternative to traditional analog meters allows operators to read meters \nremotely  as  well as  manage  the  water  usage  rate  in  real  time.  The  smart  meter \nmonitoring program developed by K-water analyzes usage, abnormal flow, and indoor \nleakage from the metering information, and provides usage and tariff information to \ncustomers through the internet and a mobile app. Previously, flow and water pressure \nwere managed in one district metered area (DMA), but with the application of smart \nmeters, a DMA is divided into 3\u20135 subdistrict metered areas (SDMAs). Figure 9 shows \nhow a DMA was divided into smaller districts. \nThe management of the daily water flow rate enables quicker responses than before. \nSmart metering makes it possible to quickly identify leakage locations\u2014immediate \ndetection can reduce leakage from burst pipes and reduce non-revenue water (NRW)\u2014\nto  quickly  correct  inaccurate  or  damaged  meters,  to  reduce  supply  costs,  \nto  improve  asset  management  efficiency,  and  ultimately  to  enhance  customer \nsatisfaction.  \n18 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 985  Lee \n \nIn the case of Seosan City, Boryeong Dam supplies 80,700 m3 of water per day, sufficient \nfor a population of 157,000. The water penetration rate is 91% and the NRW rate is \n16.6%. One specific area in the city, Cha-ri, was operated by two DMAs, and it was \ndifficult to identify and cope with water loss due to the relatively wide supply area. Efforts \nto reduce loss were nevertheless essential because of drought. \nIn general, Seosan City has a relatively low NRW rate, whereas the rate of Cha-ri was \nthe city\u2019s highest at 32% in 2015 (Table 10). Improvements were made by installing smart \nmeters, and nine SDMA systems were built within the existing two DMAs. In addition, \nNRW analysis was converted to a daily system, which was previously monthly. Finally, \nwater flow monitoring was expanded from three branches to 12. \nAfter  the  installation  of  smart  meters,  intensive  leak  detection  was carried  out on \nvulnerable sections, reducing flow meter errors. Comparing the DMA flow rate and the \ntotal flow rate of the water supply area in Cha-ri resulted in a difference of 430 m\u00b3 per \nday;  inflow  meter  failures  were  detected  and  flow  meters  were  substituted.  After \nanalyzing the patterns of both seasonal and hourly customer usage through smart \nmetering, water pressure management is now conducted hourly. Automatic control of the \ndecompression  valve  through  SCADA  systems  are  adjusted  according  to  usage, \ndepending on the season and holidays. \nTable 10: Non-revenue Water Comparison, 2015 and 2016,  \nCha-ri Water Supply Area, Seosan \nNRW (%)  March  April  May  June  July  August  September \n2015  40.8%  36.5%  37.8%  28.8%  34.4%  26.2%  28.5% \n2016  37.5%  26.6%  30.6%  26.8%  29.6%  11.6%  9.8% \nVariation Rate  \u21933.3%  \u21939.9%  \u21937.2%  \u21931.9%  \u21934.8%  \u219314.6%  \u219318.7% \nNRW = non-revenue water. \nSource: K-water document. \nThere is now greater flexibility in managing the response times required to address \ncomplaints of failure. As a result of installing the first smart metering system in June \n2016, an NRW rate of 10% was achieved. As indoor leak detection has improved, so has \nthe NRW rate and customer satisfaction. The control system allows for the analysis of \ncustomers\u2019 usage patterns according to the time of day. It also provides a \u201cleak suspicion\u201d \nalarm enabling inspectors to quickly visit a site and take recovery action if a leak is \ndetected.
