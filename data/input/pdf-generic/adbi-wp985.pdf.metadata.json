INTRODUCTION \n\nLee \n\nThe Republic of Korea has been widely recognized for its rapid transformation from a \nwar-devastated nation into one of the 10 largest economies in the world. The main driving \nforces are said to have been factors such as the comprehensive development plans laid \nout by the central government and strong leadership; industry development and export-\ncentered policy; and foreign investment, high demand for education, and the diligence \nand  solidarity  of  Koreans.  Furthermore,  investment  in  social  overhead  capital  (SOC) \nacted as a catalyst for social and economic development. Of these, policies to address \nthe  problems  of  chronic  flooding  and  drought  as  well  as  the  development  of  water \nresources to meet the country\u2019s ever-increasing demand acted as the backbone for its \nrapid economic development. Water policy and management started in the 1960s along \nwith the national economic development plans. Figure 1 shows the chronological water \nmanagement  changes  in  the  Republic  of  Korea.  In  the  1960s,  a  multipurpose  dam \ndevelopment plan was set up by the central government, and several multipurpose dams \nand multi-water supply systems had been built by the 1990s. Since 2000, the water policy \nhas  increasingly  focused  on  efficiency  and  environment-friendliness  rather  than \ndevelopment or expansion. \n\nFigure 1: Water Management History in the Republic of Korea \n\n \nSource: Long-Term Comprehensive Water Resources Plan (2001\u20132020) \u2013 3rd revision, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure \nand Transport, 2016. \n\nAs  shown  in  Figure  2,  the  central  government  built  multipurpose  dams  and  water \nresource infrastructure as laid out in the Comprehensive National Territorial Plan and the \nLong-Term  Comprehensive  Water  Resources  Plan.  These  acted  as  the  basis  for \nstimulating  the  country\u2019s  economic  development  and  were  especially  effective  in  the \nearly stages. One unit of water resource development increased gross domestic product \n(GDP) by 0.577 units in the early stages of development, whereas in the mature stages \nof development, GDP has increased by 0.214 (Choi et al. 2016). \n\nDeveloping  countries \ntransportation, \ncommunication, and electricity ahead of water. However, water should also be regarded \nas a necessity both for the citizens\u2019 daily lives and industrial activities.  \n\nto  prioritize \n\ninvestment \n\nroads, \n\ntend \n\nin \n\nSystemized  laws,  institutions,  and  leadership  are  regarded  as  key  factors  for  the \nsuccessful development and maintenance of water resources in the Republic of Korea \n(see Araral and Yu 2013). \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 985 \n \n\nLee \n\nFigure 2: Water Resources Development and Gross Domestic Product per Capita  \n\nComprehensive National Territorial Plan \n\nLong-Term Comprehensive Water Resources Plan  \n\n \n\n1st (1972\u20131981), 2nd (1982\u20131991),  \n3rd (1992\u20132001), 4th (2000\u20132020) \n1st (1966\u20131975), 2nd (1981\u20131991),  \n3rd (1991\u20132011), 4th (2001\u20132020) \n\nSource: Long-Term Comprehensive Water Resources Plan (2001\u20132020) \u2013 3rd revision, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure \nand Transport, 2016. \n\nRecently,  there  has  been  a  remarkable  paradigm  shift  in  water-related  policy  and \ninstitutions in the country (see Araral and Yu 2013). For the integration of water resources \nmanagement, which encompasses water quantity, water quality, aqua-ecosystem, and \ndisaster prevention, among others, two main ministries related to the water management \nsector  were  combined.  On  28  May  2018,  the  national  congress  determined  that \ngovernment organizations at the central level would be reorganized, with the Ministry of \nEnvironment  managing  the  water  sector  in  an  inclusive  way  in  terms  of  both  water \nquantity and water quality.  \n\n2.  STATUS OF WATER RESOURCES  \n\nWater resources in the Republic of Korea total 132.3 billion cubic meters (m3), of which \n76.0 billion m3 (57%) is available as shown in Figure 3. In 2014, total water use was 37.2 \nbillion  m3,  accounting  for  28%  of  total  water  resources.  Since  the  volume  of  \ntotal water use exceeds the amount of normal water runoff, which is measured during \nthe normal nonflood season, flood runoff needs to be reserved in impoundments. Among \nthe  total  amount  of  water  uses,  household,  industry,  and  agriculture  use  amounts  to \n25.1 billion m3 per year, approximately 33% of the available water resources. The water \nuse for households, industry, and agriculture are 7.6 billion m3, 2.3 billion m3, and 15.2 \nbillion m3, respectively.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 985 \n \n\nFigure 3: Water Resources Status in the Republic of Korea  \n(100 million m3 per year) \n\nLee \n\n \n\nm3 = cubic meter.  \nSource: Long-Term Comprehensive Water Resources Plan (2001\u20132020) \u2013 3rd revision, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure \nand Transport, 2016. \n\nBoth  seasonal  and  regional  variations  are  shown  in  respect  to  water  availability  in  \nthe Republic of Korea. Yearly average precipitation is 1,274 millimeters (1.6 times the \nworld  average),  more  than  half  of  which  falls  during  a  distinct  rainy  period  (June  to \nAugust), while winter precipitation is less than 10%. The rainy season brings frequent \nflash  floods.  In  addition,  the  country\u2019s  steep  mountainous  topography  initiates  high \nrunoffs and reduces opportunity for soil infiltration, therefore also contributing to flooding. \nRegional disparities in rainfall are quite stark: the south and northeast parts (Gangwon) \nof  the  country  experience  over  1,400  millimeters  of  rainfall  annually,  whereas  the \nsoutheast  region  (Gyeongsang  including  the  so-called  Central  Nakdong  River  area) \nreceives less than 1,100 millimeters of rainfall.  \n\nThe  Republic  of  Korea  has  had  to  adapt  its  water  system  to  manage  this  variability  \nand  to  provide  even  access  to  water  supplies  across  the  country.  This  effort  has \nmaterialized in the form of a sophisticated and extensive network of large, medium-sized, \nand small dams, irrigation facilities, and multiregional water systems aimed to provide \nwater supply for domestic, industrial, and agricultural uses; control river flows to prevent \nfloods and droughts; and generate hydroelectricity. It was progressively developed from \nthe 1980s to the early 2000s. \n\n3.  HISTORY OF WATER RESOURCES  \n\nMANAGEMENT POLICY  \n\nThe  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  water  policy  commenced  in  the  form  of  comprehensive  \nwater  resources  development  projects  starting  with  basin  investigations  in  the  1960s \nafter  the  Korean  War.  The  comprehensive  development  projects  included  large-scale \ndams and water control projects in major rivers in the 1970s and 1980s. The concept  \nof  eco-friendly  water  resources  management  was  born  in  the  1990s,  and  the  focus  \non  water  supply  and/or  control  moved  to  sustainable  water  management  including  \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 985 \n \n\nstream environment preservation in the 2000s. Since 2010, the policy has focused on \ncoping with climate change and advancing the water management system. The policy \nparadigm shift is shown in Figure 4. \n\nFigure 4: Water Management Paradigm Shift \n\nLee \n\n \n\nSource: K-water internal document. \n\n3.1  The 1960s: Beginning of Comprehensive Water  \n\nResources Development \n\n3.1.1  Establishment of Nationwide Water Resources Development  \n\nand Management System \n\nAs  the  government  accelerated  land  development  from  the  1960s  onward,  water \nresources  development  was  promoted  in  full  scale  with  the  Ministry  of  Construction  \nas  its  foundation.  In  1961,  the  first  5-year  economic  and  social  development  plan  \nwas  compiled.  At  the  same  time,  river  improvement  with  an  annual  length  of  \n289.3 kilometers was promoted and a 4-year water control plan was established. \n\nThe  River  Act,  enacted  for  river  management  of  water  control  in  1961,  has  played  a \nleading role in river management and water resources development so far. Meanwhile, \nthe  10-year  Comprehensive  Water  Resources  Development  Plan  (1966\u20131975)  was \nestablished  to  promote  irrigation  and  water  control  simultaneously.  In  particular,  a \nSpecial  Multipurpose  Dam  Law  was  enacted  in  1966,  which  assigned  the  task  of \nmultipurpose  dam  construction  to  Korea  Water  Resources  Development  Corporation, \nthe apparatus to enforce the law. \n\n \n\n \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 985 \n \n\nLee \n\n3.1.2  Introduction of Multipurpose Dams and Implementation  \n\nof Basin Investigations \n\nConstruction  of  Seomjingang  Multipurpose  Dam,  the  first  multipurpose  dam  in  the \ncountry, was completed in 1965. The dam\u2019s main functions are flood control, hydropower \ngeneration,  and  water  supply.  In  addition,  a  large-scale  basin  investigation  was \nconducted that focused on the four major rivers (Hangang, Nakdonggang, Geumgang, \nand Yeongsangang). \n\nIn  addition,  approximately  190  agricultural  reservoirs  were  built,  and  construction  of \nhydropower  generation  facilities  started  in  this  period  as  well  to  utilize  water  and \nreclaimed  water  for  self-sufficient  food  production,  and  to  secure  a  power  source  for \nindustrialization. Construction of Uiam Dam, built exclusively for power generation, was \ncompleted in 1967. \n\n3.2  The 1970s: Settlement of Comprehensive  \n\nWater Resources Development \n\nThe Four River Basin Development Plan (1971\u20131981) was launched and linked to the \nFirst  Comprehensive  National  Territorial  Plan.  In  addition,  a  flood  control  policy  was \nadopted along the four river basins. This was followed by construction of multipurpose \ndams. Following the plan, consistent development policy was adopted along each river \nbasin,  such  as  working  on  river  improvement  and  construction  of  estuary  banks.  The \nRiver Act was amended in 1971 to include the protection of the Vested Water Right. In \n1973, according to the 10-Year Water Resource Development Plan, Soyang River Dam \nwas constructed and became the largest multipurpose dam in the Eastern Region. The \nconstruction  of  other  multipurpose  dams  such  as  Andong  Dam  and  Daechung  Dam \nfollowed.  In  1979,  as  the  first  phase  of  developing  the  Seoul  metropolitan  area,  a \nmultiregional  water  supply  system  was  constructed  to  ensure  stable  supply  of  both \ndomestic and industrial water. \n\n3.3  The 1980s: Advancement of Comprehensive  \n\nWater Resources Development \n\nAccording  to  the  establishment  of  the  Comprehensive  Water  Resource  Development \nPlan  (1981\u20132001)  in  1980,  multipurpose  dams  including  Chungju  Dam,  Imha  Dam, \nHapcheon  Dam,  Juam  Dam,  and  Namgang  Dam  were  constructed.  In  addition, \nmultiregional water supply systems were also promoted in Seoul, the surrounding area, \nand other regions. At the same time, estuaries in the four rivers were completed. During \nthis  period,  water  usage  rapidly  increased  (tripled  from  5.1  billion  m3  in  1965  \nto  15.3  billion  m3  in  1980)  as  a  result  of  economic  development.  In  addition,  \n249  agricultural  reservoirs  were  constructed  to  secure  water  supply.  As  the  necessity  \nof  water  quality  management  became  more  prominent,  the  Korean  Environment \nDepartment  was  established  in  the  early  1980s.  It  started  working  on  water  quality \nmanagement in the public water sector.  \n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 985 \n \n\nLee \n\n3.4  The 1990s: Application of Environment-Friendly  \n\nWater Management \n\nSince  the  Long-Term  Comprehensive  Water  Resources  Plan  (1991\u20132011)  was \nestablished  in  1990,  small  and  medium-scale  multipurpose  dams  were  built,  such  as \nHoengseong  Dam,  Miryang  Dam,  Buan  Dam,  Boryeong  Dam,  Jangheung  Dam,  and \nYongdam  Dam.  In  addition,  water  demand  for  industrial  and  urban  areas  was  met \nthrough  the  construction  of  multipurpose  dams  (10  dams,  around  3.7  billion  m3 scale, \nand 600 gigawatt-hours of power generation) and the expansion of multiregional water \nsupply systems (26 facilities, 10 million m3 scale). However, media reports highlighted \nthe  incidents  of  phenol  contamination  and  organic  solvents  in  the  Nakdong  River,  \nand water quality became a prominent social issue nationwide. In the aftermath of the \nincidents,  the  Korean  Environment  Department  was  expanded  to  the  Ministry  \nof  Environment,  and  water  and  wastewater  works  belonging  to  the  Ministry  of \nConstruction  were  transferred  to  the  Ministry  of  Environment.  In  addition,  disaster \nprevention service works were transferred to the Ministry of Government Administration \nand Interior Affairs (currently the Ministry of Interior and Safety). In 1999, the Basic Plan \non River Maintenance was included in the River Environment Plan through the overall \nrevision  of  the  River  Act,  and  environment-friendly  construction  methods  and  river \nmaintenance flow concepts were adopted. \n\n3.5  The 2000s: Paradigm Shift \n\nDuring the shift from supply-oriented quantitative development to a diversified qualitative \npolicy  focusing  on  water  quality,  ecology,  and  the  environment,  dam  development \ndecreased and the importance of water quality and the environment was emphasized. \nAccordingly, alternative water resource development increased. The government strove \nto  reach  social  consensus  by  operating  water-related  councils  with  related  ministries, \nsocial societies, and private experts. In 2000, the construction of Yeongwol Dam was \ncanceled  and  the  construction  of  environment-friendly  small  and  medium-sized  dams \nincluding Pyeonlim Dam, Gunwi Dam, Buhang Dam, and Gampo Dam as well as the \nredevelopment of Seongdeok Dam were promoted. \n\n3.6  The 2010s: Adapting to Climate Change \n\nIn 2011, the second revision of the Long-Term Comprehensive Water Resources Plan \nwas conducted to secure water resource for addressing climate change and supporting \nthe water industry. In addition, the Four River Restoration Project and the Gyeong-in Ara \nWaterway Project were completed. The plan for conservation and utilization of riverside \nspaces was established by reflecting the opinions of all stakeholders through transparent \ngovernance. \n\n4.  WATER-RELATED ORGANIZATIONS AND LAWS  \n\nThe Republic of Korea\u2019s water management system can be described as centralized and \ndiversified.  In  its  early  stages  of  development,  organizations  closely  related  to \ndevelopment and quantitative growth oversaw decision making and implementation. This \nwas also true for water management departments. However, as the water management \nparadigm  changed  over  time,  its  organizational  structure  also  changed  to  be  able  to \nimplement new policies. On 28 May 2018, the Korean Parliament approved the revision \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 985 \n \n\nLee \n\nof three water management laws, resulting in drastic changes to the water management \norganizational structure of the central government. \n\nTo better understand the background and direction of the 2018 restructuring, this section \nwill focus on the organizational structure that existed beforehand. \n\n4.1  Organizational Status before 28 May 2018 \n\n4.1.1  Central Government Level \n\nIn  general,  the  Ministry  of  Land,  Infrastructure  and  Transport  was  in  charge  of  water \nquantity  management,  whereas  the  Ministry  of  Environment  was  in  charge  of  water \nquality  management.  Water  has  been  traditionally  perceived  as  a  public  good  in  \nthe  Republic  of  Korea.  Hence,  it  is  generally  accepted  that  the  government  takes \nresponsibility  for  managing  water  resources.  In  general,  the  Ministry  of  Land, \nInfrastructure  and  Transport  manages  water  quantity,  whereas  the  Ministry  of \nEnvironment manages water quality.

quantitative and qualitative management of \nwater  resources  increased.  There  has  been  criticism  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  on  the \nsubdivision of laws and administrative laws, of which there are 20 and 47, respectively, \nby  ministry.  This  resulted  in  the  overlapping  of  plans  and  created  problems  as  \nregards  effective  use  of  budgets.  Furthermore,  the  disconnection  between  qualitative \nmanagement  policies  and  quantitative  management  policies  resulted  in  failure  of \ncomprehensive  management  of  watershed  environments  and  ecosystems.  Without \nconsideration  of  water  quality,  ecosystems,  and  demand  management,  sustainable \nsupply  and  effective  disaster  management  were  impossible.  This  was  especially  so \nbecause optimal operations limited consideration of water quality and quantity by river \nsections due to the dry stream phenomenon.  \n\n4.2  Rearrangement of Water Institutions on 28 May 2018 \n\nAs mentioned earlier, water management in the Republic of Korea involves the Ministry \nof  Environment  (local  waterworks  and  wastewater  treatment),  the  Ministry  of  Land, \nInfrastructure  and  Transport  (dams,  multiregional  waterworks  and  rivers),  and  the \nMinistry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (agricultural water). \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 985 \n \n\nLee \n\nAs  a  result,  there  are  some  side  effects  such  as  duplication  of  construction  and \nmanagement  between  government  departments,  waste  of  budget,  and  overlap  \nof  regulations.  For  a  long  time,  there  has  been  a  need  for  unification  of  water \nmanagement work and management of integrated water resources.  \n\nOn  28  May  2018,  the  Korean  National  Assembly  finally  passed  the  revised  bill  of  the \nGovernment Organization Act and established the Water Management Basic Act. The \namendments to the Government Organization Act included the transfer of duties related \nto conservation, utilization, and development of water resources in the Ministry of Land, \nInfrastructure and Transport, except river management, to the Ministry of Environment. \nThe  measures  to  unify  a  large  part  of  the  water  management  work  centered  on  the \nMinistry  of  Environment  are  expected  to  mitigate  inefficiency  and  strengthen  water \nmanagement  capacity  through  the  integrated  management  of  water  quality  and  water \nquality. \n\nThe Basic Law of Water Management regulates basic concepts of water management \nand aims to sustain the water cycle system through securing water supply, conserving \nthe water environment, and preventing water disasters such as droughts and floods, and \nfinally to contribute to improving the quality of life of the people. In addition, it regulates \nthe  setting  up  of  the  water  management  committee,  which  will  establish  the  basic \nprinciples of water management, such as water as a public good, water cycle, ecological \nenvironment  conservation,  watershed  management,  and  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement, and deliberate and make decisions on important matters regarding water \nmanagement. \n\nAccording to the act, a water management committee will be set up at the national and \nbasin levels. Every 10 years, the Ministry of Environment should establish a basic water \nmanagement plan after discussing with the heads of the relevant central governments \nand the chairs of the basin management committee. \n\nThe  Water  Management  Basic  Act  is  of  great  significance,  because  it  acts  as  the \nsupreme  law  related  to  water,  thereby  resolving  conflicts  and  related  disputes.  In \nparticular,  it  is  expected  to  be  able  to  suppress  wasting  budget,  and  to  regulate  the \nconflicts  or  different  interests  among  the  diverse  ministries  that  manage  respectively \nwater  quantity,  water  quality,  agricultural  water,  and  water-related  disasters.  In  this \ncontext, the water management functions of the government have been transferred from \nthe Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport to the Ministry of Environment. \n\nIn  order  to  streamline  water  management  and  resolve  water-related  issues  such  \nas  water  disasters,  the  National  Water  Management  Committee  and  Watershed \nManagement Committee are to be established and operated (in June 2019). The Ministry \nof  Environment  plans  to  integrate  and  manage  the  local  water  supply  system  on  a \nwatershed basis. In addition, it plans to eliminate droughts by developing and supplying \nwater  resources  tailored  to  local  conditions  (for  example,  sewage  reuse,  leakage \nreduction project). It also plans to strengthen forecasts and response to water disasters \nsuch as urban flooding. \n\n5.  WATER SERVICES \n\nMultiregional water supply systems operated by K-water and local water supply systems \noperated  by  local  governments  are  two  main  water  services  in  the  Republic  of  Korea \n(Table 4). K-water supplies water abstracted from dams or national rivers, while local \ngovernments supply water abstracted from its own water sources or by a multiregional \nwater supply system or dam. \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 985 \n \n\nLee \n\nClassification \nMultiregional Water Supply \nSystem \n\nLocal Waterworks \n\nTable 4: Water Services \n\nContents \n\nThe general waterworks that provide the raw or processed \nwater to no less than two local governments \nThe general waterworks, excluding multiregional water supply \nsystems and the village waterworks, which are operated by a \nlocal government to provide the raw or processed water to its \nown residents, its neighboring local governments, or their \nresidents \n\nSource: Author\u2019s translation based on the definition clause of the law.  \n\n5.1  Dam Water \n\nK-water manages water resources development facilities such as dams and estuaries in \norder to supply domestic and industrial water to local governments or industries. Dam \nwater includes not only the reserved water in a dam but also dam water that is discharged \nin the downstream river; this is usually supplied from a dam via a downstream river. \n\n5.2  Multiregional Water Supply Systems \n\nK-water  processes  water  abstracted  from  multipurpose  dams  and  water  supply  dams \nthat  it  manages  to  meet  the  types  of  water  (raw,  settled,  and  purified  water),  and  \nthen  supplies  the  water  to  local  governments  or  industries.  From  there,  local \ngovernments  take  the  responsibility  of  channeling  water  to  households.  As  of  2014,  \nK-water  operates  35  multiregional  water  supply  systems.  The  Seoul  metropolitan  \narea utilizes 8.285 million m3 per day, which is 60.2% of the total facility capacity (13.860 \nmillion m3 per day). In terms of water supply, 52.9% of the total national water supply is \nconsumed in the Seoul metropolitan area. \n\n5.3  Local Waterworks \n\nLocal waterworks are managed by local governments to supply domestic and industrial \nwater  either  by  directly  abstracting  water  from  their  own  water  sources  such  as  local \nrivers or by receiving raw or purified water from a multiregional water supply system. As \nof  December  2013,  the  Republic  of  Korea  has  162  local  waterworks  operators  \n(7 metropolitan cities, 1 metropolitan autonomous city, 1 special self-governing province, \n75 cities, and 78 districts) and 1 multiregional water supply system business operator (K-\nwater). Figure 5 shows that 98.9% of the population had access to clean water through \nwater supply systems as of 2016, and Figure 6 shows that 92.1% had access to sewage \nfacilities in 2013. \n\n \n\n \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 985 \n \n\nLee \n\nFigure 5: Water Supply Penetration Rates  \n(%) \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Waterworks statistics, each year, Ministry of Environment. \n\nFigure 6: Sewerage Penetration Rates  \n(%) \n\nSource: Wastewater statistics, each year, Ministry of Environment. \n\n6.

The charge is \nproportionate to the amount of water used and is included in a water \nbill. It is determined by a river basin committee and imposed on end \nusers that rely on the four major rivers as their source of water. The \ncollected charges are placed into the river management fund that is \nto be spent on water quality improvement projects and to support \nresidents in the upstream of a river. The River Management \nCommittee of each river basin is responsible for managing and \noperating the fund. Water quality improvement projects include \nfinancial support for sewage facilities and livestock wastewater \ntreatment facilities, purchase of land in riparian zones for waterfront \ngreen space, and support for residents, non-point pollution reduction \nprojects, water resource conservation, and eco-friendly industries. \nBased on the Water Quality and Aquatic Ecosystem Conservation \nAct, the discharge dues were introduced in 1983 to be levied on \npolluters with the objective of minimizing damages on water quality \ncaused by water pollutants. \nWater quality improvement charges are levied on spring water \nmanufacturers, drinking spring water import/sales business \noperators, and other related industries to be spent on conserving \npublic groundwater resources and improving water quality. \nPolluters are charged for the release of pollutants in excess of the \ntotal quantity according to the Act on the Improvement of Water \nQuality and Support for Residents of the four major river basins. \n\nTable 8: Water-Related Revenue Sources for K-water \n\nContents \n\nAccording to Article 16 of the Korea Water Resources Corporation \nAct, K-water imposes and collects dam water tariffs for supplying \ndomestic and industrial water through multipurpose dams and estuary \nbanks.

CASE STUDY: SMART WATER MANAGEMENT  \n\n7.1  Paju Smart Water City \n\nA  Smart  Water  City  (SWC)  project  was  conducted  in  Paju  City,  a  municipality  where \n390,000 out of a total population of 410,000 are connected to the water supply. Here, K-\nwater in 2014 built a smart water management system that supplies safe water from the \nsource to the customer by improving the stability and efficiency of the supply based on \nscientific  management,  using  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT).  The \nproject has enabled the citizens of Paju to check the water quality in their neighborhood \nand  homes  in  real  time  using  a  water  quality  signboard  and  a  smartphone  app.  \nThe provision includes a water coordinator service whereby staff directly check the water \nquality from the tap, and a water doctor service whereby staff directly check the condition \nof indoor water pipes and clean them. As a result, civil complaints have decreased from \n4.5 to 1.3 cases per month, and the average tap-water drinking rate has increased from \n1%  (before  the  SWC  project  commenced)  to  41.5%  after  implementation.  Consumer \ndissatisfaction of tap-water quality has been allayed, and the overall satisfaction of water \nservices was greatly improved (Figure 8). \n\nFigure 8: Performance of Smart Water City \n\nSource: K-water document. \n\n \n\nAt a time when it is necessary to respond to water crises caused by both rapid economic \ndevelopment and climate change, the Republic of Korea is responding by integrating ICT \ninto water management. Smart water management creates a new paradigm of innovative \nwater management such that it can improve water security and welfare by addressing \nglobal water issues and the imperative of sustainable water usage. With those goals in \nmind,  and  in  partnership  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  K-water  is  providing \ntechnical assistance in the application of smart water management to countries such as \nBangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka. \n\n \n\n \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 985 \n \n\nLee \n\n7.2  Seosan Smart Water Management \n\nOne  of  the  most  important  tasks  for  Korean  water  supply  services  at  present  is  to \nminimize the amount of leakage and to supply consistently safe water to users. Smart \nwater management (SWM) technology is therefore essential as it allows operators to use \nreal-time information to cope with such challenges. SWM combines various technologies \nsuch as information and communication technology (ICT) systems, Supervisory Control \nand  Data  Acquisition  (SCADA)  systems,  smart  meters,  and  other  devices  to  ensure \nstability and efficiency throughout the network. SWM specifies technologies and creates \nstandards  for  the  overall  water  circulation  system.  Examples  of  applications  include \nSmart  Water  Grid  (SWG),  Smart  Water  City  (SWC),  Integrated  Water  Quality \nForecasting System (SUIRAN), and Integrated Water Management System (K-HIT). \n\nFigure 9: District and Subdistrict Metered Areas \n\nSource: K-water document. \n\n \n\nA smart meter enables the transmission of information concerning consumer tap-water \nusage  measured  by  time.  The  use  of  digital  meters  and  Internet  of  Things  (IoT) \ntechnology as an alternative to traditional analog meters allows operators to read meters \nremotely  as  well  as  manage  the  water  usage  rate  in  real  time.  The  smart  meter \nmonitoring program developed by K-water analyzes usage, abnormal flow, and indoor \nleakage  from  the  metering  information,  and  provides  usage  and  tariff  information  to \ncustomers through the internet and a mobile app. Previously, flow and water pressure \nwere  managed  in  one  district  metered  area  (DMA),  but  with  the  application  of  smart \nmeters, a DMA is divided into 3\u20135 subdistrict metered areas (SDMAs). Figure 9 shows \nhow a DMA was divided into smaller districts. \n\nThe management of the daily water flow rate enables quicker responses than before. \nSmart  metering  makes  it  possible  to  quickly  identify  leakage  locations\u2014immediate \ndetection can reduce leakage from burst pipes and reduce non-revenue water (NRW)\u2014\nto  quickly  correct \nto  reduce  supply  costs,  \nto  improve  asset  management  efficiency,  and  ultimately  to  enhance  customer \nsatisfaction.  \n\ninaccurate  or  damaged  meters, \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 985 \n \n\nLee \n\nIn the case of Seosan City, Boryeong Dam supplies 80,700 m3 of water per day, sufficient \nfor  a  population  of  157,000.  The  water  penetration  rate  is  91%  and  the  NRW  rate  is \n16.6%.  One  specific  area  in  the  city,  Cha-ri,  was  operated  by  two  DMAs,  and  it  was \ndifficult to identify and cope with water loss due to the relatively wide supply area. Efforts \nto reduce loss were nevertheless essential because of drought. \n\nIn general, Seosan City has a relatively low NRW rate, whereas the rate of Cha-ri was \nthe city\u2019s highest at 32% in 2015 (Table 10). Improvements were made by installing smart \nmeters, and nine SDMA systems were built within the existing two DMAs. In addition, \nNRW analysis was converted to a daily system, which was previously monthly. Finally, \nwater flow monitoring was expanded from three branches to 12. \n\nAfter  the  installation  of  smart  meters,  intensive  leak  detection  was  carried  out  on \nvulnerable sections, reducing flow meter errors. Comparing the DMA flow rate and the \ntotal flow rate of the water supply area in Cha-ri resulted in a difference of 430 m\u00b3 per \nday;  inflow  meter  failures  were  detected  and  flow  meters  were  substituted.  After \nanalyzing  the  patterns  of  both  seasonal  and  hourly  customer  usage  through  smart \nmetering, water pressure management is now conducted hourly. Automatic control of the \ndecompression  valve  through  SCADA  systems  are  adjusted  according  to  usage, \ndepending on the season and holidays. \n\nTable 10: Non-revenue Water Comparison, 2015 and 2016,  \nCha-ri Water Supply Area, Seosan \n\nNRW (%) \n2015 \n2016 \nVariation Rate \n\nMarch \n40.8% \n37.5% \n\u21933.3% \n\nApril \n36.5% \n26.6% \n\u21939.9% \n\nMay \n37.8% \n30.6% \n\u21937.2% \n\nJune \n28.8% \n26.8% \n\u21931.9% \n\nJuly \n34.4% \n29.6% \n\u21934.8% \n\nAugust  September \n26.2% \n11.6% \n\u219314.6% \n\n28.5% \n9.8% \n\u219318.7% \n\nNRW = non-revenue water. \n\nSource: K-water document. \n\nThere  is  now  greater  flexibility  in  managing  the  response  times  required  to  address \ncomplaints  of  failure.  As  a  result  of  installing  the  first  smart  metering  system  in  June \n2016, an NRW rate of 10% was achieved. As indoor leak detection has improved, so has \nthe NRW rate and customer satisfaction. The control system allows for the analysis of \ncustomers\u2019 usage patterns according to the time of day. It also provides a \u201cleak suspicion\u201d \nalarm  enabling  inspectors  to  quickly  visit  a  site  and  take  recovery  action  if  a  leak  is \ndetected.  This  has  resulted  in  a  reduction  of  approximately  55%  of  customers\u2019  water \nusage and a consequent reduction in cost to the customer of 70%. Based on the results \nof operation monitoring over a 2-month period, the net financial benefit is expected to be \nabout 610 million won over the next 8 years (B/C = 2.1) with a 20% improvement in the \nNRW rate and a 190,000 m3 per year leak reduction. \n\n \n\n \n\n19 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 985 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nLee \n\nAraral, E., and D.

The  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  water  policy \ncommenced in the form of comprehensive water resources development projects starting with \nbasin  investigations  in  the  1960s  after  the  Korean  War.  The  comprehensive  development \nprojects included large-scale dams and water control projects in major rivers in the 1970s and \n1980s. The concept of eco-friendly water resources management was born in the 1990s, and \nthe focus on water supply and/or control moved to sustainable water management including \nstream environment preservation in the 2000s. Since 2010, the policy has focused on coping \nwith  climate  change  and  advancing  the  water  management  system.  The  paper  provides \nlessons for developing countries that otherwise prioritize investment in roads, transportation, \ncommunication, and electricity ahead of water. The experience of the Republic Korea shows \nthat water should also be regarded as a necessity both for the citizens\u2019 daily lives and industrial \nactivities. \n \nKeywords: Republic of Korea, water management, water supply systems, water pricing \n \nJEL Classification: L95, Q25, O13 \n \n", " \n"]}
