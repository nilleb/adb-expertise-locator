Located in the Southwest Paci\ufb01c Ocean, the \nlargest island is Guadalcanal, which hosts the country\u2019s \ncapital, Honiara. There are nine main island groups, nine \nprovinces, and a capital territory. With a population of \napproximately 580,000,a approximately 90% of Solomon \nIslanders are Melanesian, although other ethnic groups \nare also present, including Polynesians and Micronesians. \nThe population is highly dispersed, with more than 85% \nliving in small rural villages. \n\nEnglish is the official national language but it is only \nspoken by a small proportion of the population. The \nwidely spoken language is Melanesian pidgin, although \nthere are over 60 additional distinct languages in use. \n\nThe islands that now make up Solomon Islands were \n\ufb01rst settled at least by 2000 BC and \ufb01rst contact with \nEuropeans was in 1568 with the Spanish Explorer \nMenda\u00f1a. The British declared most of the Eastern \npart of the Solomon Islands a protectorate in 1893, \nand by 1900 the entire Solomon Islands was under \nBritish administration. The Solomon Islands gained \nself-governance in 1976 and independence from the \nUnited Kingdom in 1978, although remains as part of the \nCommonwealth.\n\nIn 1998, con\ufb02ict caused by ethnic tensions, interisland \nmigration, plus economic and land disputes (largely \nbetween Isatabu Freedom Movement and Malaitan \nsettlers) escalated into violence, which continued \nunresolved for several years. The con\ufb02ict has caused \nthe displacement of approximately 35,000 Solomon \nIslanders and the death of about 200 people.b During \nthis period of unrest, the country\u2019s economy contracted \nsharply, there was widespread corruption, and law and \norder was in disarray.\n\nIn 2003, Solomon Islands requested international \nassistance to address the problems of the country. \nThe Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands \n(RAMSI), or Operation Helpem Fren, commenced in \nJuly 2003 and was a coalition of soldiers, police, and \ncivilians from Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, \nNew Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Tonga, and \nVanuatu. The RAMSI worked in partnership with the \nGovernment of Solomon Islands to restore law and \n\ncontinued on next page\n\nCivil Society: An Overview\n\nHistory of Civil Society in Solomon Islands\n\nVillage and chie\ufb02y organizations preceded the churches as the \nearly form of societal structures in Solomon Islands.1 The chie\ufb02y \nsystem existed in Solomon Islands well before colonization, \nand continues to exist today.2 Chie\ufb02y systems are informed by \nkastom, which is often understood as \u201ctradition,\u201d \u201ccustom,\u201d or \n\u201ccustomary law\u201d and in some cases is often used as a metronym \nfor the \u201cchie\ufb02y system.\u201d3 Kastom is a \ufb02uid concept that is speci\ufb01c \nto place, and embodies the distinctiveness of different groups.4 It \nde\ufb01nes the cultures and norms that regulate community life in \nSolomon Islands, although it is becoming increasingly fragile in \nmany locations.5\n\nAfter chie\ufb02y organizations, many of the earliest civil society \norganizations (CSOs) in the Paci\ufb01c were established by \nmissionaries, who, in addition to their religious roles, formed \nyouth and women\u2019s groups.6 The \ufb01rst missionaries to arrive in \nthe Solomon Islands included the Catholic Spanish explorer \nMenda\u00f1a in 1568. He was followed by Jean Baptiste-Epalle who \nfounded a Catholic Mission in 1845, but the mission was short-\nlived and did not return until 1898. The Anglican Diocese of \nMelanesia began in 1861, although outreach from New Zealand \nbegan some years earlier.7 The Methodist Mission arrived in \nSolomon Islands in 1902, the Seventh-Day Adventists in 1914.8 \nAn example of the women\u2019s groups set up by churches is the \nAnglican Church of Melanesia Mothers Union, which was \nestablished in Ysabel in 1919.9 After these early missionaries, \nchurch groups continued to establish themselves, including the \nSolomon Islands Christian Association, founded in 1967, the \nCommunity of the Sisters of the Solomon Islands which started \nin 1970, and the Young Women\u2019s Christian Association of the \nSolomon Islands, which was founded in 1975.\n\nSome have described three \u201cwaves\u201d of nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) arriving in the Solomon Islands. The \n\ufb01rst wave, occurring after the arrival of early missionaries and \nchurch groups, were overseas NGOs arriving in the Solomon \nIslands prior to independence in 1978.10 The Boy Scouts \nestablished troops in Solomon Islands in 1951,11 while the Girl \nGuides\u2019 Association of the Solomon Islands held their \ufb01rst \nmeeting in Honiara in 1958.12 Others to be established in this \n\ufb01rst wave of overseas NGOs were the Red Cross, the Foundation \nof the Peoples of the South Paci\ufb01c, and Catholic Relief Services.13 \nThese \u201c\ufb01rst wave\u201d organizations provided much needed support \nto Solomon Islands, particularly disaster relief. The \u201csecond \nwave\u201d of NGOs is characterized when these international NGOs \nstayed on and established development community projects. \n\n\fbox: continued\n\norder, rebuild national institutions, and stabilize the economy. In 2013, \nRAMSI transitioned to solely a policing mission, due to operate for a \nfurther 4 years.c\n\nToday Solomon Islands is a parliamentary democracy. The country \nhas a unicameral 50-seat parliament, with a term of 4 years. The last \nparliamentary elections occurred in 2014, with the next due in 2018. \nThe head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, represented in Solomon \nIslands by a Governor-General. The Head of the Government is the \nPrime Minister, the Hon. Manasseh Sogavare.\n\nThe economy of Solomon Islands is based around agriculture, forestry, \nand \ufb01shing, with scarce availability of other income-generating \nopportunities. The three largest export commodities are rough wood \n(73% of exports in 2013), gold (9.7%), and \ufb01sh (7.8% of exports, \nboth processed and frozen \ufb01sh).d Logging dominates the country\u2019s \nexports and the rate of logging is unsustainable.e  The country is highly \ndependent on foreign aid: it jumped from being the 35th most aid \ndependent country in the world in 2000\u20132002 to being the second \nmost aid dependent country in 2009\u20132011.f In 2013, Solomon Islands \nhad one of the highest ratios of overseas development assistance to \ngross national income of any country in the world, at 27.4%.g\n\nThe country is vulnerable to adverse climate and weather events: \n\ufb02oods, cyclones, earthquakes, and tsunami. Major recent climatic \nevents have included a combined earthquake and tsunami in 2013 \nwhich displaced 2,500 people and caused 10 fatalities;h and Tropical \nCyclone Ita in April 2014 which caused 23 fatalities and displaced \n10,000 people.i Sea level rise is an ongoing concern and may render \nlow-lying coastal settlements unlivable. \n\nChallenges facing the country include its narrow economic base, \nweak state structures, the unavailability of basic services (water, \nelectricity, telecommunications) for the majority, and poor transport \ninfrastructure. Gender inequality manifests in male-dominated social \nstructures and high rates of domestic violence. The majority of the \npopulation in rural areas survives through subsistence agriculture, and \nthe gap between the rural population and those that live in the capital \nis wide in terms of access to education and earning capacity. Solomon \nIslands\u2019 human development index was 0.506 in 2014, placing it in the \nlow human development group and ranking it 156 out of 188 countries.j \n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been working with the \nGovernment of the Solomon Islands since 1973 and has cumulative \ndisbursements worth $126.1 million since that time.k \n\na.ADB. 2015.

These were local NGOs established after \nindependence and, for the \ufb01rst time, some of these new \nNGOs began to get involved in advocacy and political \nengagement with the government. The most prominent \nof these was the Solomon Islands Development Trust \n(SIDT), established in 1982. The SIDT focuses on village \nempowerment and community development. Other \nlocal CSOs to be established since independence were \nthe Solomon Islands Football Federation, formed in \n1979; the Family Support Centre, a support for victims \nof domestic, sexual, and child abuse, established in \n1995; and Vois Blong Mere Solomon Islands, a women\u2019s \nNGO that works to advance the status women through \ninformation dissemination, linking, and networking, \nestablished in 2002. \n\nIn addition, chapters of international organizations \nwere also established in Solomon Islands around this \ntime. The Red Cross Solomon Islands was established \nin 1983.14 World Vision Solomon Islands began work \nin 1981. Greenpeace started in the Solomon Islands in \n1991 and the Nature Conservancy in 1992. Transparency \nSolomon Islands, a chapter of Transparency \nInternational, was formed in 2002.\n\nIn 1984, around the time of the third wave of NGOs in \nSolomon Islands, the umbrella group for NGOs was \nformed. Two NGOs, the SIDT and the Foundation for \nthe Peoples of the South Paci\ufb01c, met in Honiara in \nresponse to government concerns that there were too \nmany NGOs representing women\u2019s issues in the Solomon \nIslands. They agreed there was an urgent need to form an \numbrella organization for NGOs in the Solomon Islands, \nso the idea of the Development Services Exchange (DSE) \nwas devised. DSE was to be the focal point for NGOs \nin the Solomon Islands and a voice for civil society.15 \nHowever, throughout the 1990s it experienced a decline \nin membership and by 2003 it was in a dire \ufb01nancial \nsituation as donors withdrew.16 Since 2010, it has \nregained ground and today represents over 75 local and \ninternational NGOs and community-based organizations.\n\nTrade unions have been active in the Solomon Islands \nsince colonial times, with early organizations including \nthe British Solomon Islands General Workers\u2019 Union. The \nMedia Association of the Solomon Islands was established \nin 1982. The Solomon Islands Council of Trade Unions was \nestablished in 1986\u2014today it represents 10 unions in the \npublic sector, and 1 private sector union.\n\nCivil Society Under Recent Administrations\n\nDuring the period of ethnic tension (1998\u20132003), civil \nsociety played a key role in attempts at peacemaking. \nThe churches were particularly involved in mediation \nand limiting the violence. Seven Anglican Melanesian \nBrothers were martyred after being involved in \ncon\ufb02ict mediation in 2003.17 The Solomon Islands \nChristian Association was instrumental in forming \n\n\fthe Civil Society Network, which advocated for peace \nand responsible government throughout.18 Christian \nwomen\u2019s groups played an active role in promoting \nunity throughout this troubled time.19\n\nchurch-based (known as church women\u2019s groups). \nThese women\u2019s groups play a role in delivering essential \nhealth and education services to women, particularly to \nthe dispersed rural population.28\n\nThe Civil Society Network, which emerged in 2001, \nwas a formation of women\u2019s, church groups, trade \nunions, other NGOs, and the chamber of commerce. \nIt campaigned on a number of issues, including \ndisarmament and good governance. However, it \nfaced division from within with the establishment of \nthe Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands \n(RAMSI), with some NGOs and civil society groups \nsupporting the intervention while others did not.20\n\nThe arrival of RAMSI also served to strengthen certain \naspects of civil society, particularly through the Australian \nGovernment and nongovernment support to civil society \nstrengthening. The support provided by international \ndonors to the DSE was signi\ufb01cant.21 However, there were \nalso concerns expressed that RAMSI gave preference \nto the input and expertise of Australian expatriates22 at \nthe expense of local support to community projects.23 \nLocal activists argued that local pastors, women\u2019s groups, \nvillage elders, and youth representatives should have been \nconsulted to direct RAMSI\u2019s efforts.24\n\nCivil Society Today\n\nToday, civil society in the Solomon Islands encompasses \nchurch groups, customary landowning groups, civic \ngroups, women\u2019s organizations, disability groups, \nagricultural or farmers associations, environmental \ngroups, community and youth organizations, sports \nclubs, trade unions, and advocacy and governance \ngroups. There is a range of both membership and \nnonmembership organizations, including those that \nare established for public bene\ufb01t, and those that are \nestablished to support their members.25 Some are \nregistered as NGOs but many, especially community \nbased organizations, are not.\n\nThe church is a large and important component of civil \nsociety in Solomon Islands. With 98% of the population \nidentifying as Christian, there is a wide variety of \ndenominations and faiths, although 90% of Christians \nbelong to one of \ufb01ve main churches: the Anglican \nChurch of Melanesia, the Catholic Church, the South \nSeas Evangelical Church, the Seventh Day Adventist \nChurch, and the United Church.26 The services offered \nby the national government do not reach far outside \nof Honiara and the churches play an important role in \nproviding services to the rural populous. The churches \nare particularly active in providing services in education \nand training, health, and youth issues.27\n\nWomen\u2019s organizations proliferate in Solomon \nIslands, both at the national and village level. It has \nbeen estimated that there are 3,000 provincial and \ncommunity women\u2019s organizations, many of these \n\nThe majority of land in Solomon Islands is under \ncustomary ownership, with up to 87% of the land \nareas under the customary system.29 There are speci\ufb01c \ncommunity-based landowning groups in Solomon \nIslands, although identifying who landowners are \nand who is representative of landowners is highly \ncontentious and the cause of much disputation. This is \nheightened in light of bene\ufb01ts due from development, \nsuch as logging, particularly in rural areas (as there is \nlittle customary land in urban areas).\n\nVillage communities are also increasingly being \norganized into formalized community-based \norganizations, called variously village councils, village \ncommittees, or village and community associations. \nThese organizations are often formally constituted with \nthe aim of attracting development and local resources \nto address high priority needs, and providing a uni\ufb01ed \nvoice for their communities. Often they register as \ncharitable trusts.30\n\nA number of CSOs produce regular media content \nin Solomon Islands. For example, Vois Blong Mere \nSolomon Islands produces a 15-minute radio show that \nis aired on Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation \nand Catholic Communications produces radio content \nand newsletters.31 Radio is the medium with the greatest \npenetration in Solomon Islands, with over 90% of the \npopulation having access to radio. One radio station, \nGud Nuis FM, is church-owned.32\n\nA new forum for civil society engagement in Solomon \nIslands is social media. Forum Solomon Islands \nInternational is a Facebook page for expatriate Solomon \nIslanders. It is highly active and robust in its criticism of \ngovernment. It has been registered as a CSO in Solomon \nIslands. However, while mobile phone penetration \nis relatively high (around 50 subscriptions per 100 \npeople), internet penetration is low (at 6 users per 100 \npeople).33\n\nThere is one local Solomon Islands university in \nSolomon Islands: the Solomon Islands National \nUniversity was established in 2012, being formed out \nof the Solomon Islands College of Higher Education. \nIn addition, there is a Solomon Islands campus of the \nUniversity of the South Paci\ufb01c.\n\nNGOs in Solomon Islands are seen by the public as \nbeing relatively free of corruption, with only 11% of \nthose surveyed by Transparency Solomon Islands \nbelieving that NGOs were engaged in corruption. This \nis in the context of the majority surveyed believing \nthat corruption was on the rise in Solomon Islands and \n85% believing that police were corrupt.34 The issue \n\n\fof corruption has been taken up by some in the civil \nsociety sector, with one civil society coalition calling \nfor a freeze on all donor funds to the Government of \nSolomon Islands until corruption issues have been \naddressed.35\n\nThere are several important and intersecting concepts \nfor understanding the perception of the work of civil \nsociety today in Solomon Islands. Wantok, or \u201cone \ntalk,\u201d describes the ties that bind communities and the \nexpectation of reciprocity and mutual obligation of \nrelations bound by social or geographical associations.36 \nWantokism, in addition to serving as an informal form of \nsocial welfare and support, also has been argued to have \nthe potential to be a check against corrupt behavior.37 \nAnother important concept is the focus on the local over \nnational, translating to a lack of \u201csense of nation\u201d and a \nlack of broad community understanding on the role that \na national government should play, partly in response to \nthe fact that the state reach does not extend far outside \nHoniara.38 Some have characterized Solomon Islands as \nless of a nation, and more a country of villages.39 These \ncultural concepts have implications for the work of \ncivil society: much of the focus of CSOs is at the local or \ncommunity level, rather than at the national level.\n\nThese concepts combine with two other issues: a \nperception of an expectation of direct personal bene\ufb01t \nfrom community development projects by citizens or \nclients; and NGO perceptions of a perceived passivism, \ndependency, or lack of community ownership of \nNGO projects.40 It has been argued that the concept \nof \u201cdevelopment\u201d can sometimes be understood in \nSolomon Islands as merely the disbursement of petty \nfunds. This understanding of development may be due \nto the name of the \u201cRural Constituency Development \nFund,\u201d which is a discretionary fund given to each \nSolomon Islands sitting member of parliament (MP) for \ndistribution in their local communities. The practical \noutcome of this is that national politicians disburse \nfunds, goods, and services to their local communities, \nwith the argument that some local communities expect \nthe same from civil society. Some NGO workers in \nSolomon Islands have expressed a concern about the \nperceived passivity of the recipients of development \nassistance\u2014expecting similar bene\ufb01ts of money and \ngoods as provided by politicians.41 Further concerns \nare raised about a lack of community ownership of \nprojects unless payments are involved. These concepts \nhave implications for civil society operating in \nSolomon Islands today, including how civil society and \ngovernment projects are perceived and engaged with by \nlocal communities.\n\nSome local NGOs have argued that pursuit of donor \nfunding has resulted in indigenous NGOs adopting \ndonor-driven agendas at the expense of indigenous \nconsent and knowledge. There is a concern that \ncommunity knowledge and values are not adequately \nbeing incorporated into foreign civil society \n\ninterventions, as local NGOs seek funding from \ninternational donors to survive. There are also concerns \nabout the sustainability of these interventions without \nclear exit strategies.\n\nKey Civil Society Organizations in \nSolomon Islands\n\nChurch-based Organizations\n\nAdventist Development Relief Agency (ADRA)\nankou-deemi@adra.org.sb \n+677 38656/30438\n\nCatholic Communications Solomon Islands\nhttp://www.catholicchurchsolomonislands.com\nsrssala@gmail.com \n+677 22125\n\nChristian Care Centre (CCC)\nhttp://sistersofthechurch.org/our-houses/solomon-\nislands/christian-care-centre  \n+677 22801\n\nMothers Union (Church of Melanesia)\nmumelanesia@solomon.com.sb\n+677 20572\n\nSolomon Islands Christian Association\n+677 23350\n\nLocal Nongovernment Organizations\n\nEnvironmental Concerns Action Network of \nSolomon Islands (ECANSI)\necansi@solomon.com.sb\n+677 28642 \n\nFamily Support Centre\nfsc@solomon.com.sb or nyreefsc@gmail.com\n+677 26999\n\nLive and Learn Environmental Education\nhttp://www.livelearn.org/locations/solomon-\nislands\nsolomons@livelearn.org\n+677 23697\n\nSolomon Islands Development Trust (SIDT)\nhttp://www.sidt.org.sb\nadmin@sidt.org.sb, longden.m@sidt.org.sb\n+677 23409\n\nSolomon Islands Football Federation (SIFF)\nhttp://www.siff.com.sb\nadministration@siff.com.sb\n+677 26 496\n\n\fSolomon Islands Planned Parenthood Association \n(SIPPA)\nmike.salini@gmail.com, msalini@fpsi.com.sb\n+677 22991 / 27554\n\nTransparency Solomon Islands (TSI)\nhttp://transparencysi.org\neo@transperencysi.org\n+677 28319\n\nThe Media Association of Solomon Islands (MASI)\nLeni Dalavera\n+677 7508764\n\nVois Blo Mere (VBMSI)\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Vois-Blong-Mere-\nSolomon-750776398289020/timeline/\nl vbms@solomon.com.sb\n+677 28738\n\nInternational Nongovernment Organizations\n\nCaritas Australia\nhttp://www.caritas.org.au/learn/countries/\nsolomon-islands\nquestions@caritas.org.au\n\nOxfam International\nhttps://www.oxfam.org.au/country/solomon-\nislands/\nkatieg@oxfam.org.au\n+677 22004\n\nSave The Children\nhttps://www.savethechildren.org.au/our-work/\nwhere-we-work/paci\ufb01c-islands/solomon-islands \ninfo@savethechildren.org.au, peter.sykes@\nsavethechildren.org\n+677 22400\n\nThe Nature Conservancy (TNC)\nhttp://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/\nasiaandthepaci\ufb01c/solomonislands/index.htm \nasiapaci\ufb01c@tnc.org or watu@TNC.ORG\n+677 20940\n\nUnion Aid Abroad (APHEDA)\nhttp://www.apheda.org \napheda@solomon.com.sb\n+677 24453 \n\nGovernment\u2013Civil Society Relations\n\nThe Government of Solomon Islands has had an uneven \nresponse to the civil society sector since independence, \nat times engaging civil society in its programs and \ndevelopment agenda and occasionally criticizing \nelements of civil society for its methods and approaches. \nSome have argued that NGO and government relations \nin Solomon Islands have been \u201cbeset with friction, \nmisunderstanding, and potential difficulty,\u201d although \nthere are suggestions this is improving.42 In 2003, the \ngovernment characterized the relationship between \ncivil society and the government as not very healthy and \nsuspicious.43 The government at that time expressed \nconcerns that civil society has been overly critical of \nits work and that some NGOs were unduly in\ufb02uenced \nby foreign agendas.44 The SIDT in particular has had a \nrocky relationship with the government, with reports \nthat members of the government were seeking ways to \ndismantle SIDT early after it was established.45\n\nIn 2003, the Ministry of Home Affairs commissioned the \nServices Taskforce of Solomon Islands Report with the \naim of formulating a community development strategy \nbetween the government and NGOs in implementing \nnational programs. This taskforce encouraged an \nimprovement in the relationship between civil society \nand the government to one based on mutual respect. \nTo achieve this, the taskforce recommended the \nestablishment of a memorandum of understanding \n(MOU) between the government and civil society.46 A \nframework MOU was developed between the two and \npresented to Cabinet in 2010. However, this MOU was \nnever executed. Instead, the government has indicated \nthat it will introduce an NGO bill, but this is yet to be \nreleased. Civil society has expressed frustration about \nthe lack of formal mechanisms for engaging with \nvarious levels of government.47\n\nEnvironmental and logging issues have been an arena of \ndiscord between the government and civil society groups. \nThe government and civil society clashed over logging on \nPavuvu Island in 1995, when sections of civil society raised \nconcerns over the license issued to a logging company. \nThe Prime Minister at the time urged civil society not \nto interfere with government matters, leading to an \nNGO petition and peaceful demonstration at Parliament \nHouse.48 Logging and environmental issues have \ncontinued to be a point of dispute in Solomon Islands.\n\nWorld Vision International Solomon Islands\nPhone: http://www.worldvision.com.au/\nandrew_catford@wvi.org \n+677 23092\n\nWorld Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)\nhttp://www.wwfpaci\ufb01c.org/about/solomon_islands_/ \nsseeto@wwfpaci\ufb01c.org\n+677 28023\n\nIn more recent times, the government has more \nactively cultivated the views and participation of \ncivil society. The government involved civil society \nin its consultations and planning for the National \nDevelopment Strategy 2011\u20132020, with consultations \ntaking place across all provinces for the \ufb01rst time; and \nagain with the more recent revision of the National \nDevelopment Strategy covering 2016\u20132035. The \nNational Development Strategy recognizes the role of \ncivil society and NGOs in national development in\n\n\f(i) \n\nimprovement of service delivery by providing an \nenabling environment for provincial administrations \nto deliver goods and services and infrastructure \ndevelopment; strengthening their management \ncapacity including in partnership with NGOs \nable to cost effectively provide services on behalf \nof government within a transparent legal and \nregulatory framework;\n\n(ii)  preparation of a medium term National Poverty \n\nAlleviation Plan through stakeholder consultations \nin partnership with national and provincial \nauthorities, civil society, NGOs, and the donor \ncommunity;\n\n(iii)  implementation of current laws and regulations in \n\ncoordination with relevant public and private sector \norganizations, international bodies including family \nsupport, service providers, NGOs, and survivors to \naddress gender-based violence;\n\n(iv)  implementation of the Family Protection Act in \n\ncoordination with the Royal Solomon Islands Police \nForce, family support and service providers, NGOs, \nsurvivors, and development partners; and\n(v)  conducting readiness activities for Reducing \nEmissions from Deforestation and forest \nDegradation and related conservation and \nsustainability measures (REDD+) and informing line \nministries about the program and carbon \ufb01nancing \nalternatives to logging, and working with NGOs and \nCSOs on REDD+ compatible projects.\n\nAt times, civil society uni\ufb01es to hold government \naccountable, although its capacity to do this is thought \nto need strengthening. Examples where civil society \nhas criticized the government include the diversion \nof landowner royalty funds, concerns over the use of \nConstituency Development Funds, the costs associated \nwith a Prime Ministerial trip to Indonesia, and the \ndecision in 2015 by the government to grant MPs \ntax-free salaries.49, 50 This issue has generated a large \npush-back on the policy from the public and civil \nsociety alike.51 In addition, in 2013, the government was \nengaged in a protracted wage dispute with the teachers \nunion.52\n\nThe government currently partners with civil society \non a range of initiatives, including: the Coral Triangle \nInitiative, involving various ministries plus NGOs \nsuch as The Nature Conservancy, World Wide Fund \nfor Nature, the World Fish Center, and the Foundation \nfor Peoples in the South Paci\ufb01c; SafeNet, a network \nto provide services to victims of domestic violence \nand abuse, for which the government has signed an \nMOU with civil society; and DSE and Transparency \nSolomon Islands, who were part of an MOU signed \nwith the government and the extractive industry to \npromote transparency in extractives in 2012.53, 54, 55 The \ngovernment has also established a partnership with \nthe Kastom Garden Association while the Solomon \nIslands Development Trust works in partnership with \n\nthe Ministry of Rural Development and Planning to \nfacilitate trainings for rural community helpers to \nimprove the implementation of the Rural Constituency \nDevelopment Fund. In addition, the Ministry for Home \nAffairs, as the focal ministry for NGOs, is represented on \nthe DSE Board as an ex-officio member.\n\nThe Legal Framework for Civil \nSociety56\n\nCivil Society Organization Registration\n\nThere is no government central registry of CSOs \nin Solomon Islands. Civil society organizations are \ngenerally registered either under the Cooperative \nSocieties Act (1953) or the Charitable Trusts Act (1964) \nin Solomon Islands. For those organizations that do \nregister, most register under the Charitable Trusts \nAct. Organizations eligible to register under this act \ninclude those established for religious, educational, \nliterary, scienti\ufb01c, social, or charitable purposes. They \nmust register with the Registrar of Companies. Those \norganizations eligible to register under the Cooperative \nSocieties Act are those cooperatives whose objectives \nare to promote the economic interests of their members. \nThese organizations must register with the Registrar of \nCooperative Societies.\n\nIn addition, there is speci\ufb01c legislation that regulates \nthe activities of some religious groups (such as Church \nof Melanesia Trust Board [Incorporated] Act and the \nChurch of the Province of Melanesia [Solomon Islands] \nProperty Act) along with speci\ufb01c legislation pertaining \nto the Solomon Islands Red Cross Society.\n\nOrganizations registered under the Cooperative \nSocieties Act are required to submit their \ufb01nancial \nstatements annually to the Registrar of Societies, but \nthere is no such provision in the Charitable Trusts Act.\n\nTax Treatment of Civil Society Organizations\n\nCSOs in Solomon Islands are generally exempt from \na range of taxes, although the exemption differs \nfor each tax. Organizations which are exempt from \ngoods tax include not-for-pro\ufb01t institutes of learning; \norganizations promoting the interests of a university \nor school; sport promotion bodies; and any religious, \ncharitable, or benevolent institution. CSOs are generally \nexempt from paying income tax and stamp duties on \nproperty.\n\nThere are also general provisions for the relevant \nminister to waive or reduce sales tax and customs and \nexcise duties.\n\n\fUmbrella and Coordinating Bodies\n\nDevelopment Services Exchange\n\nThe DSE was formed in 1984 and is the umbrella \ncoordinating body for civil society in Solomon Islands. \nThe DSE\u2019s mission is to strengthen effective NGO \ncoordination in Solomon Islands. The DSE plays an \nimportant coordination, facilitation, and networking \nrole, building collaborations and cooperation between \nNGOs, the government, and donors in Solomon \nIslands. DSE has 75 actively registered members \nthroughout Solomon Islands. DSE provides various \nservices for its members including advocacy, capacity \nbuilding, collecting, and sharing information. It \nproduces a salary survey and a directory of members. \nIt is also the National Liaison Unit for Solomon Islands \nwith the Paci\ufb01c Islands Association of Nongovernment \nOrganizations.\n\nThe DSE has a civil society directory that is available by \ncontacting DSE directly.\n\nContact details:\n\nGeneral Secretary: Nancy Jolo\nP.O.

It represents 10 unions in the public sector, and \n1 private sector union.\n\nContact details:\n\nTel: sictu.sinuw@solomon.com.sb\nE-mail: +677 27640\n\nCivil Society Capacity\n\nCivil society has been described as having relatively \nweak capacity in Solomon Islands, but with the \npotential to play a vital role in improving governance \nin Solomon Islands.57 CSOs are able to access funds \nfrom a range of donors from different countries, with \nmany funded projects having a particular focus on \nstrengthening civil society capacity.\n\nCSOs source funds from a range of international \ndonors including overseas government, particularly the \ngovernments of Australia and New Zealand. They have \nalso accessed funds from the European Union, United \nNations Development Fund for Women, United Nations \nDevelopment Programme, and international NGOs such \nas CIVICUS. Several of these funders have a priority \nfocus area to strengthen civil society in Solomon Islands, \nincluding the European Union through the Non-State \nActors in Development Program and the Australian \nGovernment\u2019s Solomon Islands NGO Partnership \nAgreement, valued at A$20 million from 2009 to 2014. \nSome local organizations also receive funding from  \nthe Solomon Islands government and through \nmembership fees.\n\nA signi\ufb01cant majority of NGOs are dependent on \nexternal funding. As donors also set priorities about the \nnature and size of the activities funded, some NGOs are \ncaught in a cycle of short-term funding and unable to \nengage in long-term planning.\n\nThe capacity challenges facing CSOs in Solomon \nIslands are numerous, including staff shortages, \nmaintaining links and networks outside of Honiara, \nobtaining equipment and supplies, communications and \ntransportation costs, and lack of basic infrastructure.\n\nIt is difficult for civil society to recruit and maintain \nquali\ufb01ed personnel. This is especially so for local CSOs \nwho may not be able to match the pay and conditions \nof their international counterparts. There is also high \nlabor force mobility, in part due to the higher salaries \noffered by other sectors.58 For example, the national \numbrella body for trade unions is entirely voluntary, \nwhich is a decline in capacity from 1999 when it had \ntwo paid staff. Of its affiliate unions, only four have paid \nstaff. Overall, trade unions in Solomon Islands have \nweak infrastructure and human resource capacity.59\n\n\fIn addition, there is a wage disparity between women \nand men in Solomon Islands for those working in the \ncivil society sector.60\n\nCapacity gaps for civil society staff are in organizational \nleadership, project design, proposal writing, \nmanagement of the project cycle, and \ufb01nancial \nmanagement.61 In addition, there are signi\ufb01cant capacity \ndifferentials between CSOs based in the capital Honiara \nand the rural areas. Most NGOs and CSOs are based in \nHoniara, and there is a stark difference between the \ndevelopment assistance that reaches Honiara compared \nto rural areas.62\n\nPower outages and slow internet connections are further \nchallenges for those working in Honiara, let alone the \nregions (many of which are not connected to the grid). \nAnother challenge, especially for rural CSOs, is securing \nadequate equipment and supplies, considering transport \ndifficulties between islands. Speci\ufb01c civil society sectors \nalso face speci\ufb01c challenges: for example, those working \nin domestic violence prevention \ufb01nd it very hard to \nrent or purchase land for safehouses or crisis centers, \nespecially in rural areas.63\n\nA capacity concern for civil society is the issue of \nengaging with local communities and the expectations \nfor distribution of immediate material bene\ufb01t, along \nwith the NGO workers or church leaders being seen by \nsome in local communities as \u201cmiddle people.\u201d Some \nlocal NGOs \ufb01nd it difficult to match the fees paid and \nservices paid by international organizations and local \nSolomon Islands MPs.64 There also is a perception in \nsome communities that funding for communities is \nspent on these middle people, not spent directly on the \ntarget communities.65\n\nHowever, despite these capacity constraints, CSOs in \nSolomon Islands regularly come together to work on \nissues of joint concern. For example, a group of 11 NGOs \ncame together to prepare an NGO Shadow Report on the \nStatus of Women in the Solomon Islands. Civil society has \nalso collaborated on the NGO response to the United \nNations Universal Periodic Review.\n\nDSE, as the umbrella group for civil society, works \nto address the capacity constraints of its members \nand help civil society better respond to community \npriorities. It offers its members training in a \nnumber of areas, including \ufb01nancial management \nliteracy, governance and leadership development, \nhuman resources development, media literacy, and \nproject management. A particular focus of capacity \ndevelopment in Solomon Islands has been to increase \nskills and systems related to \ufb01nancial management. The \nstrengths of civil society vary signi\ufb01cantly across the \nsector: some civil society groups have well-developed \nplanning and implementation strengths but others lack \ncapacity in these areas.\n\nAsian Development Bank\u2013Civil \nSociety Cooperation in Solomon \nIslands\n\nADB has been working with the Government of \nSolomon Islands since 1973 and has cumulative \ndisbursements worth $126.1 million since that time.66 \nADB has approved 18 loan projects valued at $102.42 \nmillion, 13 grant projects totaling $147.08 million, and \n73 technical assistance projects totaling $25.90 million. \nADB recognizes Solomon Islands as operating in a fragile \nand con\ufb02ict-affected situation, which means that ADB \nadopts particular approaches that are fragile and con\ufb02ict-\naffected situation sensitive in its work in the country.\nThe Paci\ufb01c Department of ADB covers operations in \n14 countries, including Solomon Islands. Within the \ndepartment, the Paci\ufb01c Liaison and Coordination Office, \nbased in Sydney, Australia, is the ADB\u2019s focal point for \nthe programming, preparation, and implementation \nof assistance to Nauru, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. \nIn 2008, the World Bank and ADB established a joint \npresence in Honiara to provide better aid coordination.67 \nIn 2016, ADB opened an Extended Mission in Solomon \nIslands, further strengthening ADB\u2019s in-country presence.\n\nThe ADB engagement with civil society in Solomon \nIslands has primarily focused on consultation and \nimplementation of grants and projects, but in recent \ntimes, engagement outside this process has increased. In \nAugust 2015, ADB held a 3-day training workshop with \ncivil society in Honiara titled \u201cCivil Society Protection \nfor Development Effectiveness. Engaging with ADB: \nthe How and the Why for Civil Society Organizations.\u201d \nThe workshop engaged with about 20 people including \nrepresentatives from civil society (local and international \nNGOs, and community-based organizations) in Solomon \nIslands. DSE and Live and Learn gave presentations at \nthe workshop. The workshop covered how civil society \nis able to engage with ADB on projects, particularly \naround social safeguards, including land acquisition and \nresettlement safeguards.\n\nADB in Solomon Islands has been actively engaged with \nthe Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries, \nand Food Security, which was launched in 2007. It is \nas a multilateral partnership among six Paci\ufb01c island \ncountries, including Solomon Islands. The Coral \nTriangle Initiative is being implemented in cooperation \nwith the civil society group WWF, and ADB has an \nMOU in place with WWF to govern these partnership \narrangements around natural resource management.\n\nThe Private Sector Development Initiative\u2014a regional \ntechnical assistance administered by the Paci\ufb01c Liaison \nand Coordination Office\u2014has been working with NGOs \nand civil society in the Solomon Islands to economically \nempower women.68\n\n\fWest \u2018Are \u2018Are Rokotanikeni Association. The Private \nSector Development Initiative has worked with the \nWest \u2018Are \u2018Are Rokotanikeni Association, an established \nNGO in southwest Maliata, to identify women who \nare well placed to engage in a business maintaining \nand repairing solar panels. A total of 18 entrepreneurs \nattended the \ufb01rst training session where they received \nhands-on solar maintenance training as well as \nadvice on registering their business and opening bank \naccounts.\n\nSolomon Islands Chamber of Commerce and Industries. \nThe Private Sector Development Initiative is also \nworking with the Solomon Islands Chamber of \nCommerce and Industries to develop a governance \nprogram directed at persons seeking to become \ndirectors and those who are already in such positions. \nIt includes the creation of materials and case studies \non corporate governance, governance by large non-\ncorporate institutions including associations, and \nspeci\ufb01cally governance of state-owned enterprises.\n\nAsian Development Bank Country \nOperations Business Plan, 2017\u20132019\n\nThe Solomon Islands country operations business plan \nis aligned with the strategic priorities of the Paci\ufb01c \nApproach, 2016\u20132020; the Midterm Review of Strategy \n2020; and the government\u2019s National Development \nStrategy, 2016\u20132035, along with the policy statement and \npolicy strategy.69, 70, 71 The Paci\ufb01c Approach will assist the \n11 smaller Paci\ufb01c island countries (including Solomon \nIslands) pursue opportunities for economic growth, job \ncreation, and human development by reducing costs, \nmanaging risks, and enabling value creation.\n\nThe country operations business plan continues the \nADB\u2019s support to three sectors: energy, public sector \nmanagement, and transport. The country operations \nbusiness plan includes water and other urban \ninfrastructure and services as a new sector for ADB \ninvolvement. In terms of regional projects, private \nsector and \ufb01nancial sector development is supported \nthrough the Paci\ufb01c Private Sector Development \nInitiative, the Paci\ufb01c Business Investment Facility, and \nthe inclusion of Solomon Islands in a proposed new \nsubregional project supporting agribusiness \ufb01nancing \nand sustainable tourism development.72\n\nAsian Development Bank Supported \nActivities Involving Civil Society\n\nThe Solomon Islands: Strengthening Financial Inclusion \nproject was approved in September 2014 and aims to \n\nimprove access to and use of \ufb01nancial services in rural \nareas to promote economic opportunity. The project is \nfocusing on smallholder farmers in two provinces by \nimproving \ufb01nancial literacy and increasing access to \n\ufb01nancial services (including branchless banking models) \nin order to improve livelihoods through increased \nparticipation in the cash economy. Under this $600,000 \ntechnical assistance, the \ufb01rst phase of the project is \ncarrying out \ufb01eld surveys on \ufb01nancial capability in the \ntwo provinces. This \ufb01rst phase is being undertaken in a \ncost partnership with World Education Australia, a not-\nfor-pro\ufb01t organization specializing in \ufb01nancial literacy, \nlivelihood development, and micro\ufb01nance.\n\nA $6.61-million grant plus a $6.61-million loan was \napproved in August 2014 to address the damage to \ninfrastructure from the April 2014 \ufb02ash \ufb02oods arising \nfrom Tropical Cyclone Ita in Solomon Islands. The \ndamage was estimated to be equivalent to 9.2% of the \ngross domestic product of Solomon Islands, with 23 \npeople killed, 10,000 displaced, and over 50,000 people \naffected by the \ufb02ooding.73 The reconstruction work \ninvolves public consultation.\n\nThe regional technical assistance for Strengthening \nCoastal and Marine Resources Management in the \nCoral Triangle of the Paci\ufb01c (Phase 2) is a $1.95-million \nproject approved in 2010 which aims to increase \nfood security through improving coastal and marine \nmanagement and resilience. In Solomon Islands, the \nproject will work with The Nature Conservancy and \nWorldFish Solomon Islands. WorldFish conducted \nparticipatory stakeholder workshops in Malaita \nprovince in 2013 as a part of this project.\n\nThe Domestic Maritime Support (Sector) Project is a \nmajor infrastructure project that was approved by ADB \nin 2008 aimed at rehabilitating 12 wharves or jetties, \nand it is expected to conclude in 2019. CSOs in Solomon \nIslands are playing a key role in gender awareness \ntraining, engaging women in construction activities, \nand training on HIV/AIDS awareness and occupational \nhealth and safety.74\n\nThe Economic Recovery Support Program\u2013\nSubprograms 1 and 2 were two grants approved in \n2010 and 2011, each valued at $5 million. The grants \nwere designed to improve \ufb01scal management in the \nwake of the 2009 \ufb01nancial crisis and increase private \nsector development, to reduce reliance on foreign aid \nand unsustainable logging. Civil society was involved \nin design and implementation of these grants. In the \ndesign phase, consultations were held with CSOs \nincluding Solomon Women in Business, Solomon \nIslands Chamber of Commerce, and Transparency \nSolomon Islands.75 As part of the implementation of \nthe grants, the Solomon Islands Extractive Industries \nNational Stakeholder Group was formed in 2012 which \nincluded landowner groups, other civil society groups, \nextractive companies and government, and its mandate \n\n\fwas to oversee and coordinate the Extractive Industries \nTransparency Initiative in Solomon Islands, to promote \ntransparency and accountability in the extractive \nsector. CSO representatives included the DSE and \nTransparency Solomon Islands. \n\nThe Economic and Financial Reform Program, \napproved in 2013, was a $5-million grant aimed at \ncontinuing reform of public sector management, \nspeci\ufb01cally by delivering better \ufb01nance management, \ngreater economic efficiency for a business enabling \nenvironment, and broader access to social services. \nThe program involved civil society in the design phase, \nincluding the DSE, the Solomon Islands Chamber \nof Commerce, and the Solomon Islands Women in \nBusiness Association. In addition, 41 civil society \norganizations, including 7 women\u2019s groups, were \nconsulted during the preparation of the 2014 budget.76\n\nThe technical assistance project Support for the \nFormulation of a National Strategic Plan was approved \nin 2010 and provided assistance to the Government \nof the Solomon Islands in developing the draft of the \nNational Development Strategy, 2011\u20132020. Civil society \nwas involved in the consultation process under the \nproject with consultations held across all administrative \nareas in the country. Over 30 workshops were held in \n2011 with over 500 people attending in total, including \nrepresentatives from churches, civil society, and NGOs. \nADB subsequently provided technical assistance to \nsupport a revision of the existing National Development \nStrategy to cover the 2016\u20132035 period under a \n$600,000 technical assistance project approved in 2014.\n\nUnder the regional technical assistance project \nMainstreaming Environment for Poverty Reduction, the \nNGO Live & Learn developed demonstration activities \nand implemented the concept of REDD+. The pilot \ncommunities were in the central south area of Choiseul. \nThe pilot project aimed to produce tools for education \nand capacity building for forest-dependent indigenous \ngroups and local people in the Solomon Islands around \ngovernance and the implementation of REDD+.77\n\nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction \n\nThe Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction was established \nin 2000. It provides direct assistance to the poorest \nand most vulnerable groups in developing member \ncountries, while fostering long-term social and \neconomic development.78 It provides both project \ngrants and technical assistance to developing member \ncountries. Since its establishment in 2000, it has \napproved nine grants for the Paci\ufb01c. Two technical \n\nassistance projects have been approved for Solomon \nIslands. The \ufb01rst is Supporting Transport Sector \nDevelopment, valued at $800,000 and approved in \n2010. The second project was Strengthening Country \nSafeguard Systems in the Transport Sector, valued \nat $600,000 and approved in 2012. This project \ninvolved engaging with a range of government and \nnongovernment stakeholders including civil society in \ndeveloping the institutional framework for safeguards \nassessment and protections in the transport sector \nin Solomon Islands. The project worked with the \nparastatal body, Landowners\u2019 Advocacy, and the \nLegal Support Office to deliver seven awareness-\nraising workshops in 2014, including engaging with \nrepresentatives of civil society.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1#J.

It is \ndistinct from the government and the private sector and consists of a diverse range of individuals, groups, and nonpro\ufb01t organizations. \nThey operate around shared interests, purposes, and values with a varying degree of formality and encompass a diverse range\u2014\nfrom informal unorganized community groups to large international labor union organizations. Of particular relevance to ADB are \nnongovernment organizations, community-based organizations and people\u2019s organizations, foundations, professional associations, \nresearch institutes and universities, labor unions, mass organizations, social movements, and coalitions and networks of civil society \norganizations (CSOs) and umbrella\u00a0organizations.a \n\nADB recognizes CSOs as development actors in their own right whose efforts complement those of governments and the private \nsector, and who play a signi\ufb01cant role in development in Asia and the Paci\ufb01c. ADB has a long tradition of interacting with CSOs in \ndifferent contexts, through policy- and country strategy-level consultation, and in designing, implementing, and monitoring projects.\n\nIn 2008, ADB launched Strategy 2020, which articulates the organization\u2019s future direction and vision until 2020.b Above all, Strategy \n2020 presents three complementary strategic agendas to guide ADB operations: inclusive economic growth, environmentally \nsustainable growth, and regional integration. These agendas re\ufb02ect the recognition that it is not only the pace of growth but also the \npattern of growth matters in reducing poverty in the region. In this new strategic context, partnerships with a range of organizations, \nincluding CSOs, will become central to planning, \ufb01nancing, implementing, and evaluating ADB projects.\n\na.ADB. 2012.

These were local NGOs established after \nindependence and, for the \ufb01rst time, some of these new \nNGOs began to get involved in advocacy and political \nengagement with the government. The most prominent \nof these was the Solomon Islands Development Trust \n(SIDT), established in 1982. The SIDT focuses on village \nempowerment and community development. Other \nlocal CSOs to be established since independence were \nthe Solomon Islands Football Federation, formed in \n1979; the Family Support Centre, a support for victims \nof domestic, sexual, and child abuse, established in \n1995; and Vois Blong Mere Solomon Islands, a women\u2019s \nNGO that works to advance the status women through \ninformation dissemination, linking, and networking, \nestablished in 2002. \n", "In addition, chapters of international organizations \nwere also established in Solomon Islands around this \ntime.

Transparency \nSolomon Islands, a chapter of Transparency \nInternational, was formed in 2002.\n", "In 1984, around the time of the third wave of NGOs in \nSolomon Islands, the umbrella group for NGOs was \nformed. Two NGOs, the SIDT and the Foundation for \nthe Peoples of the South Paci\ufb01c, met in Honiara in \nresponse to government concerns that there were too \nmany NGOs representing women\u2019s issues in the Solomon \nIslands. They agreed there was an urgent need to form an \numbrella organization for NGOs in the Solomon Islands, \nso the idea of the Development Services Exchange (DSE) \nwas devised. DSE was to be the focal point for NGOs \nin the Solomon Islands and a voice for civil society.15 \nHowever, throughout the 1990s it experienced a decline \nin membership and by 2003 it was in a dire \ufb01nancial \nsituation as donors withdrew.16 Since 2010, it has \nregained ground and today represents over 75 local and \ninternational NGOs and community-based organizations.\n", "Trade unions have been active in the Solomon Islands \nsince colonial times, with early organizations including \nthe British Solomon Islands General Workers\u2019 Union.

However, it \nfaced division from within with the establishment of \nthe Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands \n(RAMSI), with some NGOs and civil society groups \nsupporting the intervention while others did not.20\n", "The arrival of RAMSI also served to strengthen certain \naspects of civil society, particularly through the Australian \nGovernment and nongovernment support to civil society \nstrengthening. The support provided by international \ndonors to the DSE was signi\ufb01cant.21 However, there were \nalso concerns expressed that RAMSI gave preference \nto the input and expertise of Australian expatriates22 at \nthe expense of local support to community projects.23 \nLocal activists argued that local pastors, women\u2019s groups, \nvillage elders, and youth representatives should have been \nconsulted to direct RAMSI\u2019s efforts.24\n", "Civil Society Today\n", "Today, civil society in the Solomon Islands encompasses \nchurch groups, customary landowning groups, civic \ngroups, women\u2019s organizations, disability groups, \nagricultural or farmers associations, environmental \ngroups, community and youth organizations, sports \nclubs, trade unions, and advocacy and governance \ngroups. There is a range of both membership and \nnonmembership organizations, including those that \nare established for public bene\ufb01t, and those that are \nestablished to support their members.25 Some are \nregistered as NGOs but many, especially community \nbased organizations, are not.\n", "The church is a large and important component of civil \nsociety in Solomon Islands.

This is \nheightened in light of bene\ufb01ts due from development, \nsuch as logging, particularly in rural areas (as there is \nlittle customary land in urban areas).\n", "Village communities are also increasingly being \norganized into formalized community-based \norganizations, called variously village councils, village \ncommittees, or village and community associations. \nThese organizations are often formally constituted with \nthe aim of attracting development and local resources \nto address high priority needs, and providing a uni\ufb01ed \nvoice for their communities. Often they register as \ncharitable trusts.30\n", "A number of CSOs produce regular media content \nin Solomon Islands.

One radio station, \nGud Nuis FM, is church-owned.32\n", "A new forum for civil society engagement in Solomon \nIslands is social media.
