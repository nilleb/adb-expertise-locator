It is \ndistinct from the government and the private sector and consists of a diverse range of individuals, groups, and nonpro\ufb01t organizations. \nThey operate around shared interests, purposes, and values with a varying degree of formality and encompass a diverse range\u2014\nfrom informal unorganized community groups to large international labor union organizations. Of particular relevance to ADB are \nnongovernment organizations, community-based organizations and people\u2019s organizations, foundations, professional associations, \nresearch institutes and universities, labor unions, mass organizations, social movements, and coalitions and networks of civil society \norganizations (CSOs) and umbrella\u00a0organizations.a \nADB recognizes CSOs as development actors in their own right whose efforts complement those of governments and the private \nsector, and who play a signi\ufb01cant role in development in Asia and the Paci\ufb01c. ADB has a long tradition of interacting with CSOs in \ndifferent contexts, through policy- and country strategy-level consultation, and in designing, implementing, and monitoring projects.\nIn 2008, ADB launched Strategy 2020, which articulates the organization\u2019s future direction and vision until 2020.b Above all, Strategy \n2020 presents three complementary strategic agendas to guide ADB operations: inclusive economic growth, environmentally \nsustainable growth, and regional integration. These agendas re\ufb02ect the recognition that it is not only the pace of growth but also the \npattern of growth matters in reducing poverty in the region. In this new strategic context, partnerships with a range of organizations, \nincluding CSOs, will become central to planning, \ufb01nancing, implementing, and evaluating ADB projects.\na.ADB. 2012.
