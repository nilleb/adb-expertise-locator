They are the need to make a living, the need for social \norganization, the need for knowledge and learning, the need \nfor normative and metaphysical expression, and the need for \naesthetic manifestation. These nuts and bolts of everyday life \nwork through the co-evolving realms of environment, econ-\nomy, society, polity, and technology to make up systems of \nmutual sustainability or (in opposition) mutual vulnerability.\nSince  people  (not  economies)  are  the  main  object  and \nultimate  purpose  of  endeavors  to  progress,  a  society\u2019s  cul-\nture is not just an instrument of development cooperation: it is its basis. The marriage of \neconomy and environment was overdue and has spawned a world agenda for that purpose. \nLikewise, the relationship between culture and development should be clarified and deep-\nened in ways that are authentic, indigenous, self-reliant, sovereign, civilized, and creative.\n\nDefinition\nCulture, defined in its broadest sense, is the totality of a society\u2019s distinctive ideas, beliefs, \nvalues, and knowledge. It exhibits the ways humans interpret their environments. \n\nApplications\nCulture  theory  is  a  branch  of  anthropology,  semiotics,  and  other  related  social  science \ndisciplines such as political economy, in particular, but also sociology and communication \n(to name a few). It seeks to define heuristic concepts of culture. Hence, cultural studies \noften concentrate on how a particular phenomenon relates to matters of ideology, national-\nity, ethnicity, social class, and gender.11 The potential for application is correspondingly \nvast\u2014it follows that practitioners of culture theory draw from a diverse array of theories \nand  associated  practices  and  encompass  many  different  approaches,  methods,  and  aca-\ndemic perspectives.22 And so, it remains relatively unstructured as an academic field that \nneeds to move from \u201cLet\u2019s\u201d to \u201cHow.\u201d Taking culture into account should mean under-\nstanding how cultural dimensions enter utility and production functions of various kinds. \nIn the case of development agencies and their partner countries, new processes of policy \nanalysis  and  participatory  management  should  surely  be  devised  so  that  non-economic \nsocial  sciences  become  full  partners  in  the  decision-making  concerning  the  policy  and \ninvestment decisions that guide business processes. Much remains to be done.\n\n1 \n\n2 \n\nIncreasingly, cultural studies also focus on the interface of information and communication technologies and \nsociety.\nFor instance, one branch of culture theory places a primary importance on the cultural institutions that are \ninvolved in the production, dissemination, and consumption of culture.\n\n\fKnowledge \nSolutions\n\nCharacteristics\nTherefore, approaches to cultural studies are likely to range widely. However, Ziauddin Sardar sees that most  \ntend to share the following characteristics\n\u2022  They aim to examine their subject matter in terms of cultural practices and their relation to power.\n\u2022  They aim to understand culture in all its complex forms and to analyze the social and political contexts in \n\nwhich it manifests itself.\n\n\u2022  They consider culture as both the object of study and the location of political criticism and action.\n\u2022  They expose and attempt to reconcile knowledge divides to overcome the split between tacit cultural knowl-\n\nedge and objective (so-called universal) forms of knowledge.\n\n\u2022  They are committed to an ethical evaluation of society, and to political action.\n\nBenefits\nCulture theory\u2019s holistic perspective, englobing the needs common to all people, does not lend itself to easy ac-\ntion. But, culture theory alone pays simultaneous and even attention to these needs and makes possible a focus \non the whole and the parts, on contexts and contents, on values and value systems, and on strategic relation-\nships between key variables, countries, blocs of countries, and human beings and the natural environment. And \nso, it yields conceptual insights and practical benefits and allows informed choices and intelligent decisions to \nbe made about the future. It enables us, for instance, to deal better with complexity and fragmentation\u2014the \nemphasis is on systems rather than on parts of systems. And it helps to ensure that economies are contextual-\nized properly and pointed in the right direction. For those reasons, among others, they can be constrained and \nenriched by the larger cultures in which they are located. Consequently, they stop functioning as self-governing \nentities. Also, by focusing on the totality and innate worth of a given society, culture theory can minimize the \nethnocentric bias that results from one\u2019s cultural conditioning.\n\nFurther Reading\nDeborah Eade (Ed.). 2002.
