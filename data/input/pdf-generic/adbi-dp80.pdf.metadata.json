INTRODUCTION \n\ninfrastructure \n\nThe  importance  of  infrastructure  for  overall  economic  development  and  enhancement  of \ntrade  and  business  activity  in  a  country  need  hardly  be  emphasized.  Infrastructure  reflects \ncredibility,  confidence,  low-cost  production,  and  market  competitiveness.  South  Asia  has \nbecome one of the fastest growing regions in the world with growth rate of around 7% in last \nfew years. The region, which accounts for around one quarter of the world\u2019s population and \naround 40% of world\u2019s poor, needs to continue with this growth momentum in a sustainable \nmanner in order to raise the overall standard of living and reduce poverty. The importance of \nphysical \nfor  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  has  been  well \ndocumented in the literature (Estache, 2004; Jones, 2004; Asian Development Bank [ADB], \n20051).  Furthermore,  investment  in  physical  and  social  infrastructure  positively  affects  the \npoor  directly  and  indirectly  in  multiple  ways.  Investment  climate  surveys  repeatedly  show \nthat  the  limited  and  poor  quality  of  infrastructure  facilities  act  as  a  major  impediment  to \nbusiness  growth  in  South  Asia.  Against  this  backdrop,  South  Asian  countries  are  making \nconcerted  efforts  to  improve  infrastructure  capacities  in  their  countries.  However,  the \ninfrastructure  construction  industry in  South  Asian  economies  is  characterized  by  a  vicious \ncycle  of  inefficiency\u2014facilities  remain  almost  entirely  in  the  public  sector  and  are  plagued \nwith  problems  related  to  inefficiency  and  weak  governance.  This,  in  turn,  yields  poor  cost \nrecovery and conflicting incentives to provide efficient, expandable, and reliable services.  \n\nThe role of adequate infrastructure for economic development has been well documented in \nthe  literature  (Biehl,  1986;  World  Bank,  1994;  Ferreira  and  Khatami,  1996;  Maree,  1996; \nArndt,  1999).  In  the  Asia  Pacific  region,  infrastructure  projects\u2014roads,  ports,  power,  and \npublic  utilities\u2014have  traditionally  been  established,  owned,  and  managed  by  the  state. \nGenerally, the projects are financed through taxes or by borrowing from commercial banks \nand  international  financial  institutions,  such  as  World  Bank  and  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB).  The  role  of  the  private  sector  has  been  relatively  limited,  usually  restricted  to \nsubcontracting  during  the  construction  phase.  However,  over  the  last  two  decades,  all  this \nhas changed. Demand for infrastructure investment has increased dramatically in response \nto  the  rapid  industrialization  and  urbanization  that  has  occurred  in  most  of  the  region\u2019s \ndeveloping economies (Maree, 1996; Arndt, 1999) and even more so in the fastest growing \neconomies,  such  as  in  India.  Governments  are  no  longer  able  to  finance  infrastructure \nprojects  solely  or  even  predominantly  from  the  public  purse  (Noel  and  Brzeski,  2005; \nGrinmsey  and  Lewis,  2004).  All  South  Asian  countries  face  budgetary  constraints  due  to, \namong other things, declining terms of trade for primary commodities, the high cost of debt \nservicing,  increasing  revenue  expenditures,  and  smaller  aid  flows.  Governments  are  also \nunder pressure from multilateral agencies to strengthen fiscal discipline as a part of their on-\ngoing  structural  reforms.  Therefore,  governments  have  reduced  their  involvement  in  the \ndesign,  construction,  and  management  of  infrastructure  projects.  Governments  are  looking \nto  the  private  sector  to  not  only  finance  but  also  build  and  operate  infrastructure  assets. \nHowever, there are some difficult issues relating to institutional set up, financing, regulatory \nauthorities,  tariffs,  and  Public-Private  Partnerships  (PPPs).  In  recent  times,  PPPs  have \nemerged  as  an  undoubtedly  vital  tool  in  building,  managing,  and  operating  infrastructure \nservices efficiently. \n\nThis  study  is  intended  to  carry  out  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  trends  in  infrastructure \navailability in South Asia, to look at the demand-supply gap in infrastructure, and to review \nthe  issues  related  to  infrastructure  financing  from  both  the  public  and  private  sector \nperspectives.  \n\n                                               \n1 ADB\u2019s Infrastructure Operations: Responding to Client Needs, March 2007, Manila.  \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 80 \n \n\n \n\nGeethanjali Nataraj \n\nimproving \n\nthe  economic  environment \n\n \nGiven the increasing importance of private sector participation in infrastructure development, \nthis  research  provides  an  increased  understanding  of  whether  and  under  what  conditions \ndeveloping  economies  in  South  Asia  can  benefit  from  PPPs  to  fund  and  finance  much \nneeded major infrastructure projects. This study also examines the constraints faced by the \nprivate sector in the region and, finally, attempts to provide policy recommendations to South \nAsian  governments  on \nfor  PPPs,  enhancing \ncompetition,  productivity,  quality,  and  delivery  systems  for  infrastructure  projects  in  the \nregion.  \n \nFurthermore,  a  study  of  the  possible  sources  of  infrastructure  financing  in  South  Asian \ncountries may not only solve infrastructural bottlenecks but may also have an impact on the \nin \neconomic  well-being  of  South  Asian  countries \ninfrastructure  projects  and  related  industries,  not  to  mention  the  fact  that  infrastructure \ndevelopment is a critical determinant of economic growth and foreign direct investment (FDI) \nin the region. Section 2 of the study gives an overview of major economic indicators of South \nAsia\u2014including  infrastructure  indicators,  points  out  the  trends  in  private  sector  investment \nfor infrastructure development in the region, and provides estimates of infrastructure needs \nof the region. Section 3 presents a comprehensive analysis of the PPPs, their meaning, and \nthe different types of PPPs. Section 4 deals with private sector participation in infrastructure-\nbuilding  in  developing  economies  and  Asia,  with  particular  emphasis  on  South  Asia.  This \nsection  also  presents  major  findings  with  respect  to  PPPs  in  the  Asian  region.  Section  5 \noutlines the support of multilateral institutions in supporting infrastructure development in the \nregion and also brings out alternative means of financing infrastructure, for instance, through \ndefense offsets. Section 6 presents India\u2019s experience with PPPs along with the cases of Sri \nLanka and Pakistan. Section 7 presents the conclusion.  \n\nincreased  employment \n\nthrough \n\n2. ECONOMIC TRENDS AND INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS IN ASIA: AN OVERVIEW \n\nThe world economy is expected to grow at a rate of 2.7% per annum in the first decade of \nthe  new  millennium.  As  a  result,  there  will  be  an  increase  in  demand  for  infrastructure \nservices  for  both  consumption  and  production  purposes\u2014not  meeting  this  increased \ndemand will cause bottlenecks to growth and hamper poverty alleviation efforts. \n \nSouth Asia has done well in recent years, exhibiting high growth in spite of inherent political \ninstability  in  Bangladesh,  Nepal,  and,  to  a  certain  extent,  Pakistan.  Other  natural  and \nunforeseen  calamities  have  also  greatly  affected  the  region  (Table  1).  There  are  several \nfactors that would help to sustain these high growth rates but, as of now, the most important \nfactor  is  undoubtedly  improvement  of  infrastructure.  Despite  the  liberalization  process  in \nmany countries of the region, South Asia\u2019s regulations for industry, labor, finance, and taxes \ncontinue  to  limit  the  region\u2019s  growth  and  employment  potential.  According  to  the  ADB 2, \nelectricity,  water,  road,  rail,  airports,  and  port  services  are  poor  through  out  the  area. \nImprovements in every country as well as intra-regional connections would yield substantial \nbenefits by reducing the costs of production and trade (Table 1).  \n\n                                               \n2 Ibid. \n\n \n\n2 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 80 \n \n\n \n\nGeethanjali Nataraj \n\nTable 1: Growth Rate of GDP in South Asia: 2002\u20132008  \n(in percentage per year) \n\n9.1 \n\n9.8 \n\n10.1 \n\n10.7 \n\n10.4 \n\n10.0 \n\n2005 \n8.7 \n6.0 \n9.0 \n8.6 \n6.0 \n2.3 \n5.6 \n\n2003 \n7.8 \n5.3 \n8.5 \n4.7 \n6.0 \n3.0 \n5.3 \n\n2002 \n3.7 \n4.4 \n3.8 \n3.1 \n4.0 \n-0.4 \n4.8 \n\n2006 \n8.7 \n6.7 \n9.2 \n6.6 \n7.2 \n2.3 \n6.0 \n\n2004 \n7.4 \n6.3 \n7.5 \n7.5 \n5.4 \n3.5 \n6.5 \n\n2008* \n8.0 \n7.0 \n8.3 \n6.5 \n6.0 \n2.8 \n5.9 \n\n2007* \n7.7 \n6.5 \n8.0 \n6.8 \n6.1 \n2.8 \n5.6 \n\n \nCountry \nSouth Asia \nBangladesh \nIndia \nPakistan  \nSri Lanka \nNepal \nSouth-East \nAsia \n10.0 \nPRC  \nSource: Asian Development Outlook: 2007 \nNotes:  \n1.* Refers to forecasts. \n2.

PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China \n \nApart  from  experiencing  high  growth  rates,  the  region  has  also  built  up  large  foreign \nexchange  reserves  of  nearly  US$250  billion.  In  addition,  gross  domestic  investment  as  a \npercentage of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  has  also  increased  in  all  the  countries  of  the \nregion. For instance, in 2005, gross domestic savings as a percentage of GDP was nearly \n33.8%  in  India  and  in  Nepal  it  touched  nearly  29%.  FDI,  another  major  source  of \ninfrastructure development funding, has been increasing, although South Asia fairs poorly in \ncomparison  to  neighbouring  South-East  Asia  and  East  Asia,  especially  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC). For example, India managed to attract around US$8 billion in FDI \nin 2005 as compared to the PRC\u2019s US$72 billion in the same year. The distinguishing and \ncommon  characteristic  of  South  Asian  countries  as  compared  to  their  neighbours  is  its \nrecent, rapid economic growth. Can this growth be increased to 8\u201310% and sustained? The \nchallenge  is  daunting.  The  higher  growth,  increase  in  per  capita  income,  and  urbanization \namong  other  things,  will  put  further  demand  on  more  advanced  physical  and  social \ninfrastructure  to  sustain  these  trends  and  also  to  create  productive  economic  activities. \nImprovement  in  infrastructure  services  remains  the  key  to  growth  and  prosperity  in  the \nregion.  \n\n2.1. Comparison of Infrastructure Facilities in East and South Asia \n\nThere  is  a  wide  disparity  and  difference  in  the  level  of  infrastructure  facilities  across  Asia. \nThere  is  a  marked  difference  in  both  the  overall  level  of  infrastructure  access  among \ncountries  and  differences  in  the  overall  characteristics  of  infrastructure  provision  reflecting \npast  investment  priorities.  Tables  2  and  3  provide  a  summary  of  comparative  indicators  of \ninfrastructure across developing regions worldwide and a summary of infrastructure access \nindicators, respectively.  \n\n \n\n3 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 80 \n \n\n \n\nGeethanjali Nataraj \n\nTable 2: Summary of Comparative Indicators of Infrastructure  \nacross Developing Regions \n\nAFR \n\n674 \n\nEAP \n\n1823 \n\nECA \n\n474 \n\nMNA \n\n300 \n\nSAR \n\n1378 \n\n \nRegion  \n\nPopulation (in millions) \n\nliving  on \n\nPercentage \nUS$1-a-day \nPercentage of Urban Population \n\nless \n\nthan\n\n46 \n\nMajor Access Indicators \n\nto \n\nto\n\nElectricity  \n(%  of  population  access \nnetwork) \nWater  \n(%  of  population  access \nimproved sources) \nSanitation  \n(%  of  population  access \nimproved sanitation) \nRoads  \n(%  of  rural  population  living  within\n2 km of an all-season road) \nTeledensity  \n(fixed  line  and  mobile  subscribers\nper 1,000 people) \n\nto\n\n15 \n\n43 \n\n62 \n\n88 \n\n36 \n\n51 \n\n24 \n\n58 \n\n78 \n\n36 \n\n49 \n\n34 \n\n95 \n\n4 \n\n65 \n\n70 \n\n99 \n\n91 \n\n82 \n\n77 \n\nLCR \n\n518 \n\n10 \n\n77 \n\n85 \n\n89 \n\n89 \n\n74 \n\n54 \n\n2 \n\n59 \n\n70 \n\n92 \n\n88 \n\n75 \n\n51 \n\n31 \n\n28 \n\n42 \n\n43 \n\n84 \n\n35 \n\n65 \n\n61 \n\n62 \n\n357 \n\n438 \n\n416 \n\n237 \n\nSource: Jones 2006 \nNote: AFR: Sub-Saharan Africa; EAP: East Asia and Pacific; ECA: Eastern Europe and Central Asia; \nLCR: Latin America and Caribbean; Middle East and North Africa; SAR: South Asia.  \n \nTable 2 demonstrates the large gap in almost all indicators (except water access) between \nEast Asia and South Asia.  \n\n \nTable 3: Summary of Infrastructure Access Indicators in  \nSouth and South East Asia, 2005 \n \nSanitation \n\nElectricity Water \n\n \n\nTeledensity  Road Density \n(by population) \n\nRoad Density \n(by area) \n\n13 \n75 \n34 \n77 \n86 \n78 \n80 \n84 \n90 \n78 \n73 \n\n5 \nAfghanistan \n25 \nBangladesh \n10 \nCambodia \n97 \nPRC \n40 \nIndia \n80 \nIndonesia \n5 \nMyanmar \n15 \nNepal \n55 \nPakistan \n75 \nSri Lanka \n60 \nViet Nam \nSource: Jones 2006. \nNote:  Electricity  (%  of  population  access  to  network),  Water  (%  of  population  access  to  improved \nsources),  Sanitation  (%  of  population  access  to  improved  sanitation),  Teledensity  (fixed  line  and \nmobile subscribers per 1,000 people), Roads (% of rural population living within 2 km of an all-season \nroad). \n\n32 \n1594 \n70 \n189 \n1115 \n203 \n \n107 \n334 \n \n287 \n\n12 \n16 \n38 \n424 \n71 \n127 \n8 \n18 \n44 \n122 \n88 \n\n \n1.6 \n1 \n1.4 \n3.2 \n1.7 \n \n0.6 \n1.8 \n \n1.2 \n\n8 \n48 \n16 \n44 \n30 \n52 \n73 \n27 \n54 \n91 \n41 \n\n4 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 80 \n \n\n \n\nGeethanjali Nataraj \n\n \nAccording  to  Table  3,  the  PRC  has  near  universal  access  to  the  electricity  network \ncompared  with  access  for  only  40%  of  the  population  in  India.  However,  India  scores \nsignificantly higher than the PRC in relation to access to improved water resources. Among \nthe  countries,  Afghanistan,  Cambodia,  and  Myanmar  stand  out  as  particularly  lagging  in \nterms of the proportion of the population connected to key national infrastructure networks. \nThus, this unequal access to infrastructure facilities and levels of infrastructure development \nhave created a huge gap between the advanced developing countries of Asia and the low-\nincome, least-developed countries of the region.  \n\n2.2. Infrastructure Deficit in Asia \n\nIn  recent  years,  the  infrastructure  deficit  has  become  the  most  glaring  deficit  that \ngovernments around the world have to deal with. The gap between infrastructure needs and \nthe resources governments possess to meet those needs is ever growing. Many developing \ncountries across the globe, and even more so in South Asia, have congested roads, bridges \nin  need  of  repair,  poorly  maintained  transit  systems  and  recreational  facilities,  and \ndeteriorated  hospitals,  schools,  and  waste  treatment  facilities  all  in  urgent  need  of \nrehabilitation  and  repair.3 Governments  promise  many  new  projects  to  close  the  gap,  but \noften do not or cannot find the funding to follow through on their promises. These problems, \nin turn, impose large costs on society, from lower productivity to reduced competitiveness to \nan increased number of road and industrial accidents.  \n \nThere  is  no  question  that  this  infrastructure  deficit  is  impeding  South  Asia\u2019s  growth.  More \nthan  a  third  of  Indian  firms  surveyed  in  the  2004  Investment  Climate  Assessment  cite \ninfrastructure  as  a  \u201cmajor\u201d  or  \u201csevere\u201d  obstacle  to  business  expansion;  in  Bangladesh,  the \nfigure  is  78%.  Power  is  the  most  critical  bottleneck,  with  transportation  a  close  second.  In \nBangladesh, firms experience power shortages 250 days a year; in Nepal, there is a power \nshortage almost every day. As a result, about 40% of firms in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, \nSri  Lanka,  and  Maldives  have  their  own  generators.  Businesses  in  Pakistan  and  India \nestimate they lose 5\u20138% in annual sales due to power-related problems.  \n \nSouth  Asia  is  choking  with  poor  quality  roads,  inefficient  ports,  and  inadequate  transport \nservices. India has very few interstate expressways linking its major economic centers and \nonly 3,000 km of four-lane highways. In the last 10 years, the PRC has built 25,000 km of \nfour-  to  six-lane,  access-controlled  expressways.  The  inefficiencies  of  the  Chittagong  Port \nhave given Bangladesh all the characteristics of a land-locked country. Indian Railways, the \nsecond-largest  rail  network  in  the  world,  is  still  burdened  with  congestion,  deteriorating \nquality  of  its  rolling  stock,  and  huge  financial  losses,  though  recent  financial  results  have \nshown improvement.  \n \nFortunately,  the  growth-related  pressures  on  infrastructure,  as  well  as  the  exceptionally \nfavorable  results  from  reforms  in  some  sectors  such  as  telecommunications,  have  created \nsome momentum for further reform and investment in infrastructure in South Asia. Pakistan \nhas successfully privatized the Karachi and Faisalabad Electric Supply Companies. Building \non the success of its telecom industry, India has sufficiently reformed its ports and roads to \nattract about US$8 billion in PPPs in its urban and transport sectors.  \n \nHowever, there has not been greater momentum because infrastructure reforms are deeply \npolitical.  In  India,  state  government  parties  that  reduce  power  subsidies  to  farmers  tend  to \nlose  elections  to  parties  that  promise  to  restore  free  power.  Attempts  to  rationalize  the \nCeylon  Electricity  Board  are  resisted  by  trade  unions  that  see  it  as  the  first  step  in  the \nslippery slope towards privatization and job losses. Plans to contract out water services on a \n                                               \n3 Deloitte research study, 2006 \n\n5 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 80 \n \n\n \n\nGeethanjali Nataraj \n\nto \n\nthat \n\ninfrastructure  reform) \n\npilot  basis  in  New  Delhi\u2014where,  despite  plenty  of  supply  (250  liters  per  capita,  per  day), \nwater is available only a few hours a day\u2014led to such strong protests that the program was \nsuspended.  These  episodes  are  teaching  policymakers  and  donors  (some  of  whom  had \ntaken  a  politically-blind  approach \ntransparency  and \nconsultations  in  reforms  are  essential,  that  stakeholders  should  have  confidence  that  their \nvoices are heard, and that the design of reform options reflects what consumers are looking \nfor. In addition to infrastructure, the high cost of bureaucratic red-tape and regulations\u2014sure \nsigns of poor governance\u2014impedes investment in South Asia. More Indian firms rate these \nthings as greater constraints to growth than infrastructure. In the rankings on \u201cease of doing \nbusiness\u201d of all the countries in the world in Doing Business 2006,4 six East Asian countries \nare in the top 30, but no South Asian country is. India ranks 116th out of 155. It takes about \n71  days  to  start  a  business  in  India.  Firing  a  worker  in  Sri  Lanka  costs  an  average  of  75 \nweeks  of  salary.  Fortunately,  South  Asian  countries  are  taking  steps  to  lower  these  costs. \nPakistan  was  rated  one  of  the  top  ten  global  \u201creformers\u201d  last  year.  To  the  extent  that \ninvestors\u2014especially  foreign  investors\u2014use  changes  in  the  costs  of  doing  business  as  an \nindicator  of  future  profitability,  South  Asia  stands  to  gain  immensely  by  concentrating  on \nreforming these aspects of the business environment.  \n \nThe strong economic performance of South Asia in recent years has put South Asia on track \nto achieve the Millennium Development Goal of halving poverty by 2015. Long-term growth \nin South Asia is forecast to remain around 5.5% through 2015, reflecting a rising contribution \nto growth from the private sector. However, though the private sector has been contributing \nincreasingly  to  GDP,  this  high  GDP  growth  is  not  sustainable  given  the  infrastructure \nbottlenecks.  Infrastructure  bottlenecks  make  the  private  sector  uncompetitive  in  the  market \neconomies  of  South  Asia  in  the  near  future.  Since  infrastructure  is  predominantly  provided \nby  the  public  sector  in  these  countries,  governments  must  try  to  increase  budgetary \nallocation  for  infrastructure  investment  or  to  create  an  environment  that  allows  for  private \nsector  participation.  Against  the  backdrop  of  all  South  Asian  countries  facing  budgetary \nconstraints, the second best alternative\u2014i.e., private participation and/or PPPs\u2014is a viable \noption.  \n\n2.3 Infrastructure Needs of Asia \n\nAccording  to  ADB-JBIC-WB5 (2005)  study,  to  meet  expected  infrastructure  service  needs, \nEast  Asia  would  have  to  spend  about  US$165  billion  a  year  from  2006  through  2010\u2014or \nroughly  around  6.2%  of  its  GDP  annually\u2014on  electricity,  telecommunications,  water  and \nsanitation, and major transport networks. These estimates take into account both investment \nand maintenance of assets. In meeting these needs, it is estimated that 65% of expenditure \nwould need to take the form of new investments with the remaining 35% channeled towards \nmaintenance  of  existing  assets.  The  PRC  alone  is  expected  to  account  for  80%  of \ninfrastructure expenditures in the region.  \n \nIn  addition,  investment  requirements  for  South  Asia  as  given  in  a  World  Bank/UNESCAP6 \nstudy  indicates  that  developing  Asian  and  Pacific  countries  need  investments  annually  of \nUS$228 billion from 2006 to 2010, nearly half of it required for the energy sector. In another \nestimate, \ninvestment \nthat \nrequirements would be approximately US$300 billion per year.7  \n \n\nInfrastructure  Forum \n\nthe  Asia-Pacific \n\nthe  region's \n\nfound \n\n                                               \n4 World Bank (2006), Doing Business 2006: Creating Jobs, World Bank Publication, Washington, DC.  \n5 ADB-JBIC-World  Bank  (2005),  Connecting  East  Asia:  A  New  Framework  for  Infrastructure,  ADB,  JBIC  and \n\n6   See  Chatterton,  I.  and  O.

PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS (PPPS) \n\nGiven  the  huge  infrastructure  investment  needs  of  the  region  and  governments\u2019  limited \nresources, the role of the private sector and PPPs in enhancing infrastructure facilities in the \nregion  is  vital.  Since  the  1990s,  there  has  been  a  rapid  rise  of  PPPs  around  the  world. \nGovernments in developing as well as developed countries are using PPP arrangements for \n\n                                               \n8 These broad estimates of infrastructure investment needs are supported by aggregative analysis of investment \nneeds in the region based on regression equations linking GDP growth to infrastructure investment needs.   \n\n9 Planning Commission, Government of India, 2007. \n10 Fay  Marainne  and Tito  Yepes  (2003),  \u201cInvesting  in  Infrastructure:  what  is  needed  from 2000  to  2010,\u201d  World \n\nBank Policy Research Working Paper 3102, July 2003.  \n\n7 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 80 \n \n\n \n\nGeethanjali Nataraj \n\nimproved  delivery  of  infrastructure  services.  PPPs  are  becoming  the  preferred  method  for \npublic  procurement  of  infrastructure  and  infrastructure  services  projects  throughout  the \nworld. \n\n3.1. Features of PPPs \n\nUnder PPPs, the public and private sectors work together on the implementation of projects, \neach  retaining  their  own  identities  and  responsibilities.  They  collaborate  on  the  basis  of  a \nclearly defined sharing of tasks and risks to achieve benefits of added value and increased \nefficiency. PPPs are a procurement tool where the contract payments are usually structured \nin  such  a  way  that  the  public  authority  and/or  users  pay  only  for  services  rendered \nsatisfactorily. Project-related risks are largely transferred to the private entity. In a PPP, the \nfocus of the government shifts to policy, strategy, and a monitoring role rather than service \ndelivery.  In  the  long  term,  the  benefits  of  PPPs  are  in  improved  management  and  use  of \nfunds. Accordingly, affordability has to be the cornerstone of the planning process.  \n\n3.2. Case for Public-Private Partnerships \n\nPPPs are unlikely to entirely replace traditional infrastructure financing and development any \ntime  soon,  if  ever.  PPPs  are  just  one  tool  among  many.  Governments  typically  have  a \nnumber  of  objectives  when  building  infrastructure:  getting  good  value  for  money,  timely \ndelivery,  meeting  public  needs,  and  so  on.  The  procurement  model  that  best  addresses \nthese  objectives  is  the  one  that  is  chosen  based  on  the  circumstances  of  individual \ncases/projects\u2014PPPs have shown their potential as an important way to meet the objectives \nand address infrastructure shortages. For example, PPPs provide new sources of capital for \npublic  infrastructure  projects.  Private  equity,  pension  funds,  and  other  sources  of  private \nfinancing  must  still  be  repaid,  but  shifting  the  responsibility  for  arranging  the  financing  to  a \nprivate  partner  can  help  deliver  infrastructure  if  a  public  entity  is  unwilling  or  unable  to \nshoulder the full debt or the associated risk of the project at a particular point in time. Other \nadvantages of PPPs include: \n \n\n1.  Bringing construction forward \n\n \nConventional  procurements  typically  require  the  public  sector  to  provide  significant \ncapital  upfront,  even  though  the  benefits/results  of  the  project  may  be  delayed  or \nuncertain. Most forms of PPPs enable the public sector to spread the public's cost of \ninfrastructure  investment  over  the  lifetime  of  the  asset,  much  as  homeowners  do \nwhen  they  take  out  home  mortgages.  As  a  result,  infrastructure  projects  can  be \ncompleted much quicker, allowing users to benefit from the investment much sooner \nthan is typical under pay-as-you-go financing.11 In many cases, the private contractor \nalso has a strong incentive to complete the project as quickly as possible because it \nneeds the stream of revenues to repay the capital costs.  \n\n2.  On-time and on-budget delivery \n\nWith payments better aligned to the delivery of project objectives, PPPs also have a \nsolid track record of completing construction on time or even ahead of schedule. For \nexample, in 1997, Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) signed an agreement with P & \nO (ports and cargo handling), Australia for the development of a two-berth container \nterminal on a Build Operate and Transfer (BOT) basis for 30 years. P & O completed \n\n                                               \n11  For  example,  the  creative  financing  approach  used  for  the  Virginia  Pocahontas  Parkway  PPP  project \n\neliminated what might have been a 15-year delay in construction while financing was assembled. \n\n8 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 80 \n \n\n \n\nGeethanjali Nataraj \n\nthe project ahead of schedule and commenced operations at the new Nhava Sheva \nInternational Container Terminal (NSICT) in 1999.12   \n\n3.  Shifting construction and maintenance risk to the private sector \n\n \nPolitics  and  budget  pressures  play  havoc  with  the  proper  maintenance  of  existing \ninfrastructure. There always seems to be another, higher priority\u2014some program or \ncrisis  requires  more  urgent  funding  than  rehabilitating  an  aging  road  or  school,  a \nbudget  deficit  may  push  funding  for  infrastructure  maintenance  further  down  the \npriority list, or an upcoming election may lead politicians to delay funding for updating \na wastewater treatment plant to make way for a more politically appealing program or \nproject.  Moreover,  the  effect  of  reducing  spending  on  maintenance  is  rarely \nimmediate; politicians who opt to cut back on such spending will likely have left office \nlong  before  society  begins  to  complain  about  crumbling  roadbeds  or  overburdened \nelectricity networks. \n \nSuch deferred maintenance imposes huge costs in the long run\u2014for example, early \nintervention  costs  about  20  percent  less  than  maintenance  postponed  to  the  last \nquarter  of  a  road's  life.  Continual  deferral  of  maintenance  results  in  more  safety \nproblems  over  the  course  of  a  shorter  infrastructure  lifespan,  reduced  quality  of \nservices, and generally worse financial outcomes. \n \nWell-designed  PPPs  can  ameliorate \ntransferring  certain \nconstruction and maintenance risks to a private partner. Among the risks that may be \nassumed by the private partner are:  \n\nthese  problems  by \n\n\u2022  Design risk of infrastructure projects  (e.g., roads, flyovers)  \n\n\u2022  Meeting required standards of delivery  \n\n\u2022 \n\nIncurring excessive cost overruns during construction  \n\n\u2022  Completing the facility on time  \n\n\u2022  Underlying costs to the service delivery operator and the future costs associated \n\nwith the asset \n\n\u2022 \n\nIndustrial action against or physical damage to the asset  \n\n\u2022  Certain market risks associated with the project  \n\nThe  ability  to  shift  some  or  all  of  these  risks  to  the  private  sector  is  an  important \nbenefit  of  PPPs.  Payment  structures  require  the  assets  be  available  and  properly \nmaintained over time. The public sector thereby gains greater confidence in the level \nof \nthe  asset.  Greater  cost \nthe \ntransparency,  in  turn,  supports  more  effective  planning  and  helps  to  avoid  cuts  in \nother service areas as a result of unexpected infrastructure costs.  \n\nits  spending  commitments  over \n\nlifetime  of \n\n4.  Cost and Construction Savings \n\nCost  savings  from  PPPs  typically  materialize  in  several  forms:  lower  construction \ncosts, reduced life-cycle maintenance costs, and lower costs of associated risks. \n\n                                               \n12 In  Canada,  for  example,  Terminal  3  at  the  Toronto  Pearson  Airport  was  completed  18  months  ahead  of \nschedule under a PPP contract. The United Kingdom's National Audit Office reported in 2003 that 73% of non-\nPFI  construction  projects  were  over  budget  and  70%  were  delivered  late.  In  contrast,  only  22%  of  the  PFI \nprojects came in over budget and only 24% were late. \n\n \n\n9 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 80 \n \n\n \n\nGeethanjali Nataraj \n\nIn  traditional  contracting,  the  private  sector's  role  is  typically  limited  to  immediate \nconstruction.  This  can  create  a  perverse  incentive  to  economize  on  elements  of \nconstruction today even though maintenance costs might be higher in the long run. \nShifting  long-term  operation  and  maintenance  responsibilities  to  the  private  sector \ncreates a stronger incentive to ensure long-term construction quality because the firm \nwill be continue to be responsible for maintenance costs years down the road. This \ncreates  a  strong  incentive  to  do  preventive  maintenance  and  reduces  the  risk  of \nfuture  fluctuations  in  operations  costs.  Under  this  scenario,  the  public  benefits  from \nthe construction\u2019s life-cycle efficiency.13  \n\n5.  Strong customer service orientation \n\nPrivate sector infrastructure providers, often relying on user fees from customers for \nrevenue,  have  a  strong  incentive  to  focus  on  providing  superior  customer  service. \nMoreover, as the asset is no longer managed by the public sector, the public sector \nis  able  to  concentrate  more  on  ensuring  the  provider  maintains  certain  customer \nservice levels. Also, innovation in customer service delivery helps to account for high \nsatisfaction levels.14 \n\n6.  Enabling the public sector to focus on outcomes and core business \n\nWhen they are properly structured, PPPs enable governments to focus on outcomes \ninstead  of  inputs.  When  utilizing  PPPs,  governments  are  able  to  focus  leadership \nattention  on  the  outcome-based  public  value  they  are  trying  to  create.  While  PPPs \nhold significant benefits as an infrastructure delivery tool, the model is not without its \ncritics.  Some  of  the  criticisms  are  well-grounded  and  merit  careful  consideration \nwhen  evaluating  the  relative  pros  and  cons  of delivery  method  alternatives.  Others, \nhowever,  are  driven  by  a  misunderstanding  of  PPPs  or  are  based  on  outdated  or \nincomplete information. PPPs also present formidable challenges, both at earlier and \nlater  stages  of  market  development.  Addressing  these  challenges  and  maximizing \nthe benefits of PPPs require governments to operate in a new way. \n\n3.3. Types of PPPs \n\nPPPs across the world are becoming more  and more popular. The past fifteen years have \nseen development in the modality of private involvement. The main defining feature of PPPs \nis the degree of private control over and involvement in financing. \n \nHowever, the important point to note is that there is no unique model of PPP. Each project, \ngiven its circumstances, will define what is suitable and what is required. Additionally, each \nmodel has a different impact on the poor.  \n \nSome of the most common PPP models are:  \n \n\n1.  Design-Build (DB) \n\nUnder this model, the government contracts with a private partner to design and build \na  facility  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  set  by  the  government.  After \ncompleting  the  facility,  the  government  assumes  responsibility  for  operating  and \nmaintaining the facility. This method of procurement is also sometimes referred to as \nBuild-Transfer (BT).  \n\n                                               \n13  A  United  Kingdom  study  of  benefits  flowing  from  operating  PFI  projects  found  that,  on  average,  the \ngovernment  expects  to  achieve  a  savings  of  17%  over  the  whole-life  cost  of  services  by  using  the  PPP \napproach, with savings as high as 45% in one of the cases.  \n\n14 In the United States, the owners of the 91 Express Lanes freeway in Southern California hold focus groups to \n\nlearn more about how to please customers. \n\n10 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 80 \n \n\n \n\nGeethanjali Nataraj \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.  Design-Build-Maintain (DBM) \n\nThis model is similar to DB except that the private sector also maintains the facility. \nThe public sector retains the responsibility for operations. \n\n3.  Design-Build-Operate (DBO) \n\nUnder this model, the private sector designs and builds a facility. Once the facility is \ncompleted,  the  title  for  the  new  facility  is  transferred  to  the  public  sector,  while  the \nprivate sector operates the facility for a specified period. This procurement model is \nalso referred to as Build-Transfer-Operate (BTO). \n\n4.  Design-Build-Operate-Maintain (DBOM) \n\nThis  model  combines  the  responsibilities  of  design-build  procurements  with  the \noperations  and  maintenance  of  a  facility  for  a  specified  period  by  a  private  sector \npartner.  At  the  end  of  that  period,  the  operation  of  the  facility  is  transferred  back  to \nthe  public  sector.  This  method  of  procurement  is  also  referred  to  as  Build-Operate-\nTransfer. (BOT) \n\n5.  Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) \n\nThe government grants a franchise to a private partner to finance, design, build, and \noperate a facility for a specific period of time. Ownership of the facility is transferred \nback to the public sector at the end of that period.  \n\n6.  Build-Own-Operate (BOO) \n\nThe  government  grants  the  right  to  finance,  design,  build,  operate,  and  maintain  a \nproject to a private entity, which retains ownership of the project. The private entity is \nnot required to transfer the facility back to the government.  \n\n7.  Design-Build-Finance-Operate/Maintain (DBFO, DBFM, or DBFO/M) \n\nUnder this model, the private sector designs, builds, finances, operates, and/or \nmaintains a new facility under a long-term lease. At the end of the lease term, the \nfacility is transferred to the public sector. In some countries, DBFO/M covers both \nBOO and BOOT. \n\nPPPs can also be used for existing services and facilities in addition to new ones. Some of \nthese models are: \n\n1.  Service contract \n\nThe government contracts with a private entity to provide services the government \npreviously performed.  \n\n2.  Management contract \n\nA management contract differs from a service contract in that the private entity is \nresponsible for all aspects of operations and maintenance of the facility under \ncontract.  \n\n3.  Lease \n\n4.  Concession \n\nThe government grants a private entity a leasehold interest in an asset. The private \npartner operates and maintains the asset in accordance with the terms of the lease.  \n\nThe government grants a private entity exclusive rights to provide, operate, and \nmaintain an asset over a long period of time in accordance with performance \nrequirements set forth by the government. The public sector retains ownership of the \n\n11 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 80 \n \n\n \n\nGeethanjali Nataraj \n\noriginal asset, while the private operator retains ownership over any improvements \nmade during the concession period.  \n\n5.  Divestiture (either complete or partial) \n\nThe  government  transfers  an  asset,  either  in  part  or  in  full,  to  the  private  sector. \nGenerally the government will include certain conditions with the sale of the asset to \nensure that improvements are made and citizens continue to be served. \n\n \nThere  is  no  unique  model  when  it  comes  to  private  sector\u2019s  involvement  in  infrastructure. \nEach project, given its circumstances, will define what is suitable and what is required. Each \nmodel has a different impact on the poor. However, Greenfield project type PPPs are very \npopular  as  they  help  to  create  employment  and  it  is  easier  to  set  up  a  new  plant  and  get \napprovals  rather  than  expand  operations  or  re-build  something  on  an  existing  structure  or \ncompany.  \n\n4. INFRASTRUCTURE AND PRIVATE PARTICIPATION IN ASIA AND DEVELOPING \nECONOMIES \n\nTraditionally, infrastructure investment in Asia and across the world has been funded largely \nby  the  public  sector  and  various  multilateral  agencies  including  World  Bank,  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  and  organizations  like  JBIC.  Fiscal  space  and  lack  of  resources \nhas  limited  governments\u2019  capacity  to  finance  large  scale  infrastructure  projects.  Recently, \nhowever, the private sector has entered the picture to support government in addition to its \nown business needs to help finance and build large-scale infrastructure projects in Asia and \nthe  developing  world.  The  private  sector  participated  with  zeal  in  the  early  Nineties  in \ninfrastructure development and finance. However, private participation in infrastructure proj-\nects  in  developing  countries  plummeted  after  the  1997  Asian  crisis  and  followed  a  broadly \ndeclining trend for several years afterward. However, in 2004 and 2005 investment in such \nprojects  increased  sharply.  In  the  meantime,  the  distribution  of  investment  across  sectors \nand  regions  and  the  allocation  of  risks  between  public  and  private  parties  shifted.  Private \nsponsors started putting more emphasis on risk mitigation strategies. To take advantage of \nprivate  sponsors\u2019  renewed  interest  in  infrastructure  projects,  governments  need  to  create \nrisk-sharing  arrangements  that  attract  private  operators  while  also  benefiting  governments, \ntaxpayers, and users (Kerf and Izagurre, 2007).  \n \nFurthermore,  total  investment  commitments  to  private  infrastructure  projects  in  developing \ncountries  grew  by  70%  in  2004\u20132005,  to  reach  US$95  billion.  As  a  share  of  developing \ncountry  GDP,  investment  increased  from  0.7%  in  2003  to  1%  in  2005.  In  nominal  terms, \ninvestment  levels  in  2005  were  close  to  their  1997  peak.  Yet  in  real  terms  they  were  still \nabout 30% lower (Figure 1), and as a share of GDP they were almost 50% below the peak. \nBut  it  was  the  first  time  since  1997  that  investment  rose  two  years  in  a  row  and,  by  any \nmeasure, that growth was substantial.  \n \n\n12 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 80 \n \n\n \n\nGeethanjali Nataraj \n\nFigure 1: Investment Commitments to Infrastructure Projects with Private \nParticipation in Developing Countries by Sector, 1990\u20132005 \n \n\n \n\nSources: World Bank and PPIAF, PPI Project database. \n\n \nThe  growth  was  driven  mainly  by  one  sector:  telecommunications.  Indeed,  that  sector  has \ndominated investment since 1998, and its share in 2001\u20132005 was substantially larger than \nin the 1990s. In 2005, telecommunications claimed 63% of the total growth; at US$60 billion, \ninvestment  in  the  sector  was  just  3%  below  its  1998  peak.  With  telecommunications \nexcluded,  investment  still  rose  in  both  2004  and  2005,  though  more  modestly\u2014at  US$35 \nbillion in 2005, investment in the other sectors was a full 60% below its peak. Overall, Figure \n1  also  shows  that  investments  in  infrastructure  projects  with  private  participation  in \ndeveloping  countries  reached  its  peak  in  1997  and  suddenly  plummeted  thereafter  due  to \nthe East Asian crisis. It is only in 2000 that investments picked up again though the peak of \n1997 has not been reached again. \n \nRegions ranked by investment, 1990\u20132005 \n \nUnlike  across  industry  sectors,  the  distribution  of  investment  across  developing  regions \nbecame increasingly balanced. From 1990\u20132000, Latin America by far had the largest share \nof investment, with almost 50% of the global total. East Asia followed with 27%. Each of the \nother regions accounted for only a small share. By contrast, in 2001\u20132005, investment was \nmuch  more  equally  distributed.  Latin  America  remained  in  the  lead,  but  with  only  a  31% \nshare.  Eastern  Europe  and  Central  Asia  followed  with  27%,  East  Asia  with  18%,  and  the \nSouth  Asia region  had a  share of 7.3%.  Further,  energy  continued  to be  the  top  sector  for \nprivate  participation  in  infrastructure  with  1,307  projects  from  1990\u20132005  followed  by \ntransport (829), telecommunications (749), and water and sewerage (383) (Tables 6 and 7). \nThe  data  by  top  10  countries  on  private  projects  shows  that  the  PRC  had  483  projects, \ndominating  East  Asia,  followed  by  Brazil  (297)  in  Latin  America  and  India  having  the \nmaximum number of projects in South Asia (172) (Table 8).  \n \n\n13 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 80 \n \n\n \n\nGeethanjali Nataraj \n\nTable 6: Project Investment Ranked by Region, 1990\u20132005 (in US$ million) \n \nProject Investment \n\nRegion \nLatin America and the Caribbean \nEast Asia and Pacific \nEurope and Central Asia \nSouth Asia \nMiddle East and North Africa \nSub-Saharan Africa \nSource: Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF), World Bank. \n\n407,202\n224,194\n182,449\n70,435\n41,163\n36,510\n\n \n \nTable 7: Primary Sectors Ranked by Number of Projects in the World, 1990\u20132005 \n \n\nSector \nEnergy \nTransport \nTelecommunications \nWater and sewerage \nSource: PPIAF, World Bank. \n \n \n\nProject Count \n\n1,307 \n829 \n749 \n383 \n\nTable 8: Top 10 Countries by Projects, 1990\u20132005 \n \n\nCountry \n\nProject Count \n\nPRC \nBrazil \nRussian Federation \nArgentina \nIndia \nMexico \nChile \nColombia \nMalaysia \nThailand \nSource: PPIAF, World Bank. \n \nRecent private activity has also become somewhat less concentrated by country.

Therefore,  the  following \nsection  attempts  to  not  only  highlight  the  role  of  the  private  sector  in  infrastructure \ninvestment  in  South  Asia  but  also  to  underscore  the  constraints  to  private  participation  in \ninfrastructure construction in the South Asian region.  \n\n169,363 \n72,833 \n72,468 \n70,205 \n51,432 \n47,516 \n36,199 \n32,624 \n32,056 \n30,270 \n\n4.1. Infrastructure with Private Participation in South Asia  \n\nToday,  the  private  sector  is  the  engine  of  growth  for  many  countries  and  expansion  of  the \nprivate  sector  has  become  a  central  theme  in  the  development  agenda  of  many  of  those \ncountries.  Sustained  economic  growth  is  critical  for  job  creation  and  poverty  reduction.  In \naddition,  a  thriving,  private-sector  led  economy  is  probably  the  best  defense  against \ncorruption,  as  economies  with  broad  private  sector  participation,  active  competition,  and \nclear rules have less scope for corruption. The private sector also has much to contribute to \nother government goals, by way of tax revenues, reaching out to local communities, setting \ninternational standards, and working with governments to extend infrastructure access.  \nSouth  Asia  has  relatively  low  levels  of  private  participation  in  infrastructure.  From  1990\u2013\n2005, the region\u2019s 255 projects attracted about US$67 billion in investment commitments, far \nshort of commitments made in leading regions of East Asia (Table 10). The sector attracting \nthe largest share of investment has been telecommunications (54), and Greenfield projects \nhave constituted the most common form of PPPs, not only in terms of investment but also by \ntype of projects. Projects cancelled comprised of 5 percent of total investment in the region. \nIn  most  countries  of  South  Asia,  the  largest  investment  by  private  sector  has  been  in  the \ntelecommunications  sector\u2014nearly  US$17612.5  million  in  2001\u20132005,  followed  by  energy, \ntransport,  and  water  and  sanitation.  India  has  received  the  maximum  investment  in  the \nregion followed by Bangladesh and Pakistan (Table 11).  \n\n \n\n15 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 80 \n \n\n \n\nGeethanjali Nataraj \n\nTable 10: Infrastructure in South Asia \n \n\nFeatured Indicator, 1990\u20132005 \n\nInfrastructure Sectors Reported \n\nNumber of countries with private \nparticipation \nNumber of projects reaching financial \nclosure \nSector with largest investment share \nType of PPI with largest share in \ninvestment \nType of PPI with largest share in projects \n\nValue \n\nEnergy, Telecommunications, \nTransport, Water and sewerage \n\n7 \n\n255 \n\nTelecommunications (54%) \n\nGreenfield projects (83%) \n\nGreenfield projects (80%) \n\nProjects cancelled or under distress \n\n5 representing 5% of total investment \n\nSource: PPI database, World Bank \n \n\n \nTable 11: Investment in Infrastructure Projects with  \nPrivate Participation: South Asia (in US$ million) \n \n\nTelecommunications \n \n\nEnergy \n\nTransport \n\nWater and Sanitation \n\n1995\u201399 \n438.1 \n\n2000\u201304 \n651.3 \n\n1995\u201399 \n554.9 \n\n2000\u201304 \n501.5 \n\n1995\u201399 \n\u2013 \n\n2000\u201304 \n\u2013 \n\n1995\u201399 \n\u2013 \n\n2000\u201304 \n\u2013 \n\n7456.8 \n\n14321.9 \n\n7165.6 \n\n7559.8 \n\n1272.8 \n\n1854.3 \n\n223.2 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n20.0 \n\n98.2 \n\n39.0 \n\n\u2013 \n\n75.5 \n\n1877.7 \n\n4298.3 \n\n\u2013 \n\n421.3 \n\n47.0 \n\n601.9 \n\n524.3 \n\n176.3 \n\n132.0 \n\n240.0 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n8604.5 \n\n17612.5 \n\n12293.3 \n\n8232.3 \n\n1934.1 \n\n1901.3 \n\n223.2 \n\n29304.5 \n\n17612.5 \n\n43589.9 \n\n19697.0 \n\n24636.4 \n\n11293.5 \n\n8987.9 \n\n2852.7 \n\n5970.0 \n\n23042.7 \n\n16916.2 \n\n5359.1 \n\n10802.8 \n\n5201.1 \n\n719.8 \n\n2332.8 \n\nSource: World Development Indicators, 2006 (pp. 266\u201367). \n \nFurthermore,  a  close  look  at  private  projects  by  primary  sector  in  South  Asia  show  that \nenergy has been the dominant sector with a total of 116 projects in 1990\u20132005, followed by \ntransport,  which  has  had  about  78  projects,  with  telecommunications  occupying  the  third \nposition  with  59  projects.

Major findings with respect to PPPs in South, East and South East Asia \n\nPrivate sector investment in infrastructure also showed a wide variation across countries and \nsub-regions, largely reflecting differences in policy development, institutional environments, \nincome  levels,  and  approaches  of  governments.  South  East  Asia  started  attracting \nsignificant private investment in infrastructure early and captured the lion\u2019s share of it (about \nUS$136.6 billion), accounting for almost half the region\u2019s total between 1984 and 2005. East \nAsia  and  South  Asia  were  the  next  two  sub-regions  to  attract  significant  private  sector \ninvestment,  each  accounting  for  about  a  quarter  of  total  investment.  Private  sector \ninvestment  in  infrastructure  flowing  to  central  Asia  and  the  Pacific  was  low  or  negligible. \nPrivate sector investment in infrastructure is highly concentrated in some countries. The top \nsix  countries\u2014the  PRC  (25.3%),  India  (17.0%),  Malaysia  (15.5%),  Philippines  (10.9%), \nThailand (10.5%), and Indonesia (8.8%)\u2014account for almost 90% of the total during 1984\u2013\n2005. Country level time-series data indicate that private sector investment in infrastructure \nhas  not  recovered  to  pre-crisis  levels  in  several  South  East  Asian  economies  including \nIndonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand. In contrast, private sector investment in \ninvestment in the PRC and India was generally unaffected by the East Asian Crisis. In fact, \nmuch of the private sector investment in infrastructure in India took place after the crisis and \nhas increased in recent years. Lack of private sector investment in infrastructure reflects the \nlag in reform in India compared to East Asia and South East Asia and confirms that private \nsector investment has come back. \n \nEnergy (39.6%), telecommunications (35.9%), and transport (18.8%) accounted for most of \nthe  private  sector  investment  in  infrastructure  in  the  South  Asia  region  during  1984\u20132005, \nwith  very  little  going  to  water  and  sewerage.  The  levels  of  investment  largely  reflect  basic \nsector characteristics (e.g., technology, competition, cost recovery, and legal and regulatory \nrequirements) or the level of sector reforms that (1) affect private sector participation; and, \n(2) suggest lower scope for private sector investments in water supply, sanitation, and waste \nmanagement  than  in  the  other  sectors.  Greenfield  projects  accounted  for  more  than  two-\nthirds  of  the  total,  attracting  most  of  the  private  sector  investment  in  infrastructure  in  the \nregion and comprised the greatest number of investments in all sub-regions except central \nAsia.  Divestiture  was  the  next  largest  form  of  investment  in  the  region,  including  Central \nAsia,  East  Asia,  and  South  Asia.  The  flow  of  private  sector  investment  under  concession \narrangements  in  the  region  has  been  small  except  in  South  East  Asia  and  the  Pacific. \n\n21 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 80 \n \n\n \n\nGeethanjali Nataraj \n\nManagement  and  lease contracts  accounted  for a  negligible part  of  such  fund  flows (ADB, \n2007).16 \n \nIndia\u2019s  development  is  also  severely  constrained  by  weak  infrastructure.  Five  years  ago \nIndia invested US$18 billion in its power and transport infrastructure, about 6% of GDP. The \nPRC invested US$128 billion the same year, or about 20% of GDP. Highways, which move \nabout 70% of goods in India, account for only 2% of the country\u2019s 3.32 million kilometers of \nroad. It takes an average of 85 hours to unload and reload a ship at India\u2019s major ports, 10 \ntimes longer than in Hong Kong, China or Singapore, according to government figures. The \nIndian government estimates that US$320 billion needs to be invested in its infrastructure if \ncurrent economic growth is to be sustained.  \n \nThe  challenge  facing  infrastructure  in  South  Asia  is  securing  funding  at  competitive  rates. \nFor  example,  of  the  US$4.3  billion  capital  investment  required  to  upgrade  India\u2019s  railway \nnetwork, just one quarter will come from government. The remainder has to come from the \nprivate sector. One of the easier ways to boost infrastructure development and spending is \nto  simplify  India\u2019s  burdensome  regulatory  environment.  Despite  economic  reforms  in  the \n1990s,  India  has  some  of  the  of  the  world\u2019s  most  restrictive  labor  laws,  which  serve  to \ndiscourage corporate growth and new employment. For example, companies with more than \n100 employees require government permission to dismiss workers. The easy movement of \nhuman capital both around the country and within industry sectors to meet demand is critical \nif India is to capitalize on its young, educated workforce and expand the economy.  \n\n5. ROLE OF MULTILATERAL INSTITUTIONS IN SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE \nDEVELOPMENT IN THE REGION AND ALTERNATE FORMS OF FINANCING \nINFRASTRUCTURE \n\nThe role of multilateral institutions in financing and supporting infrastructure activities in the \ndeveloping world is extremely important. The contribution of multilateral agencies like World \nBank,  ADB,  African  Development  Bank,  Inter-American  Development  Bank,  and  the \nEuropean  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  in  infrastructure  development  and  its \nsubsequent  enhancement  of  economic  growth  and  alleviating  poverty  is  significant. \nHowever,  given  the  growing  demand  for  infrastructure  in  Asia\u2014more  specifically  in  South \nAsia\u2014multilateral  agencies  are  expected  to  play  an  even  greater  role  in  bridging  the \ninfrastructure deficit and sustaining economic growth in the region.  \n\n5.1. World Bank\u2019s Role in Infrastructure Development in South Asia \n\nThe World Bank has funded numerous projects to develop infrastructure around the world. \nRecognizing  that  it  must  play  a  key  role  in  meeting  global  needs  for  infrastructure-related \nfinancing and policy advice, the World Bank has placed infrastructure at the front and center \nof  its  development  agenda  to  reduce  poverty  and  stimulate  economic  growth.  The  World \nBank has developed an Infrastructure Action Plan, which encompasses innovative ways to \nfinance infrastructure projects. \nIn  the  1990s,  the  World  Bank  reduced  investment  lending  for  infrastructure  with  the \nexpectation  that  private  sector  investment  in  infrastructure  would  rise.  However,  the \nanticipated rise in private lending never came. Private financing for infrastructure plummeted \nfrom US$128 billion in 1997 to US$58 billion in 2002, quite contrary to the expected increase. \nBank  investment  lending  for  infrastructure  dropped  from  US$9.5  billion  in  1993  to  US$5.5 \nbillion  in  2002.  However,  since  then,  the  World  Bank  has  stepped  up  its  infrastructure \n\n                                               \n16 Sharen Diwesh, Bindu N. Lohani, Mashiro Kawai, and Rajat Nag, \u201cADB\u2019s infrastructure operations-responding \n\nto client needs,\u201d ADB publication, Manila, 2007. \n\n22 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 80 \n \n\n \n\nGeethanjali Nataraj \n\nfinancing projects and is now fully re-engaged in infrastructure development to help fill this \nvacuum and to address the high demand for infrastructure services. \n\nAs  mentioned  earlier,  in  the  1990s,  the  World  Bank\u2019s  overall  lending  volume  was  halved \n(from  US$29  billion  to  US$15  billion)  primarily  because  of  the  steep  decline  in  its \ninfrastructure  lending.  In  part,  this  was  due  to  some  disastrous  environmental  and  social \nconsequences  of  dam  construction  and  other  large  infrastructure,  while  the  failure  of \nprivatization  in  Latin  America  contributed  to  the  toppling  of  governments.  As  a  result,  the \nWorld  Bank  became  a  debt  collection  agency\u2014collecting  US$5.2  billion  more  than  it \nextended in loans. Beginning in 2003, the institution began infrastructure lending on a major \nscale; soon this type of lending will represent 40% of the institution\u2019s total business.  \n\nIn South Asia, the World Bank has played a major role in funding infrastructure in the region. \nThe  World  Bank  approved  nearly  US$3.8  billion  for  South  Asia  in  2006.  Out  of  this,  US$3 \nbillion was for India alone. US$1.2 billion in loans from International Bank for Reconstruction \nand  Development  (IBRD)  and  US$2.6  billion  in  International  Development  Agency  (IDA) \ncommitments, of which US$275 were grants. This assistance from the World Bank seeks to \naddress  the  regions  vast  urban  and  rural  infrastructure  deficit  and  weakness  in  the \ninvestment climate, including corruption and red tape.  \n\nAs the World Bank continues its efforts in infrastructure service delivery, it will also endeavor \nto  ensure  that  high  quality  in  infrastructure  projects  is  maintained  and  continually  draw  on \nlessons learned from the past to keep improving performance. An integral part of this effort \nwill  be  to  improve  the  measurement  of  results  and  infrastructure  impact\u2014especially  the \nimpact  on  the  poor.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  infrastructure  business,  in  partnership  with  other \nmultilateral and bilateral organizations, is committed to developing a \u201cresults measurement\u201d \nagenda,  to  ensure  accurate  and  transparent  measures  of  performance,  to  increase \naccountability, and to improve the quality and sustainability of development impact.  \n\n5.2. Asian Development Bank \n\nADB offers a variety of direct assistance to the private sector. Specifically, ADB's role is to \nassist  private  enterprises  to  undertake  financially  viable  projects  with  significant  economic \nand social merit and thereby achieve positive development impact. Through its involvement \nin these projects, ADB helps to facilitate more private projects, thus promoting the efficient \nuse  of  resources,  accelerating  economic  development,  reducing  poverty,  and  raising \nstandards of business. \n\nIn  addition,  ADB  assists  the  private  sector  by  mobilizing  capital.  The  demand  for  private \ncapital has increased considerably in the region, influenced by the financing needs of large \ninfrastructure  development  programs  as  well  as  the  capitalization  needs  of  financial \ninstitutions.  While  official  development  aid  continues  to  be  an  important  element  in  the \ndevelopment  strategies  of  ADB  and  its  developing  member  countries  (DMCs),  the  aid  is \ninadequate  to  meet  the  DMCs\u2019  growing  capital  requirements.  Attracting  private  capital  has \nbecome a strategic objective of many DMC governments and ADB is in a unique position to \nassist in mobilizing international private capital for its DMCs. ADB has considerable regional \nexperience  accumulated  over  decades  and, \nthrough  policy  dialogue  with  member \ngovernments, has assisted in formulating policies designed to encourage private initiatives.  \n\nFurthermore,  direct  participation  of  ADB  in  private  sector  activities  acts  as  an  additional \nattraction  to  long-term,  private  investors.  Hence,  the  presence  of  a  multilateral  bank \ninvesting  alongside  private  partners  helps  to  provide  a  sense  of  security  to  the  private \ninvestors.  Innovative  financial  solutions  involving  a  mixture  of  private  and  official  funding \nsources  may  be  needed  to  entice  commercial  lenders  and  equity  investors  to  manage  the \nrisks associated with investing in developing countries. \n\n23 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 80 \n \n\n \n\nGeethanjali Nataraj \n\nADB directly supports private enterprises, private equity funds, and financial institutions. Its \ntraditional  modes  of  financing  are  equity  investments  and  hard  currency  loans.  Equity  may \ninclude  preferred  stocks,  convertible  loans,  and  other  forms  of  mezzanine  financing.  ADB \nhas  three  credit  enhancement  products  to  facilitate  such  co-financing:  Complementary \nFinancing Scheme, Partial Credit Guarantee, and Political Risk Guarantee.  \n\nADB private sector operations focus primarily in two sectors: finance and infrastructure. The \nfinancial sector, or capital markets projects, assists private financial intermediaries in diverse \nsectors including banking, leasing, venture capital financing, merchant banking, micro-credit, \nsmall  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs),  private  equity  funds,  mutual  funds,  insurance, \nsecuritization, \nincludes \ntelecommunications, power and energy, water supply and sanitation, ports, airports, and toll \nroads. The projects may involve various forms of risk-sharing and ownership arrangements \nincluding  BOO  and  BOT  structures.  Some  examples  where  ADB  participated  include  the \nBOO  venture  for  Fauji  Oil  Terminal  in  Port  Qasim  and  the  North  Luzon  Expressway \nRehabilitation and Expansion Project in the Philippines.17  \n\ncredit  enhancement,  and \n\nInfrastructure \n\nrating. \n\ncredit \n\nADB  assists  in  analyzing  feasibility  studies  and  developing  the  structure  of  infrastructure \nprojects  and  provides  financial  support  to  qualified  projects  through  equity  investments, \nloans, and credit enhancement products, including guarantees. ADB is an active member of \nthe  Public-Private  Infrastructure  Advisory  Facility  (PPIAF),  a  multi-donor  facility,  and  also \nprovides assistance to governments to promote private sector involvement in infrastructure \nbuilding to help eliminate poverty and achieve sustainable development.  \n\nWhen  appraising  projects,  ADB  pays  particular  attention  to  the  process  of  selecting  the \ndevelopers  and  suppliers  as  well  as  to  a  project\u2019s  environmental  and  social  benefits, \nparticularly poverty reduction. A fair and transparent competitive bidding process is typically \nthe best way to ensure that the terms of the project are reasonable for all the stakeholders. \nTo be eligible for ADB assistance, the proposed investment should be in the private sector of \na  DMC  and  owned  by  private  sector  entities,  which  may  be  local  or  foreign.  An  enterprise \nowned  jointly  by  private  and  government  interests  may  be  eligible  for  ADB  assistance, \nprovided the majority of its equity is privately owned and the project is controlled by private \ninvestors. \n\nADB's  total  financial  support  for  a  project,  including  loan,  equity  investment,  partial  credit \nguarantee, and underwriting commitment, is limited by policy to 25% of the total cost of the \nproject  or  US$50  million,  whichever  is  lower.  ADB  also  provides  political  risk  guarantee \ncoverage without the host government's counter-guarantee, of up to 50% of the total project \ncost or US$100 million, whichever is less. ADB participation is intended to catalyze financing \nfrom local and/or foreign sources, not to compete with these sources. ADB's policy is to limit \nequity  investments  to  less  than  25%  of  the  total  share  capital.  Also,  ADB  cannot  be  the \nlargest  single  investor  in  an  enterprise.  If  needed,  ADB  may  assist  in  mobilizing  additional \ndebt  from  commercial  banks  and  other  financial  institutions.  This  may  be  through  parallel \nfinancing  separate  from  the  ADB  package,  or  through  co-financing,  in  which  ADB  acts  as \nlender of record. \n\nUltimately, ADB's role in financing infrastructure projects is primarily to catalyze and mobilize \nresources into private sector projects which deliver development impact, and to \"add value\" \nto  private  sector  projects  to  sustain  development  impact.  Table  19  depicts  infrastructure \nlending by ADB in the Asian region.  \n\n                                               \n17  More  examples  of  ADB  projects  are  illustrated  in  the  ADB  booklet  entitled,  \"Private  Sector  Operations,\" \n\navailable on the ADB Website. \n\n24 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 80 \n \n\n \n\nGeethanjali Nataraj \n\n \n\nLending \nShare in total lending \n(in percentage) \n\nTable 19: Infrastructure lending by ADB \n \n\nPublic Sector (in US$ billion) \n1970s \n3.6 \n54 \n\n1980s \n11.4 \n53 \n\n1990s \n26.6 \n50 \n\n2000\u201306 \n20.7 \n53 \n\nPrivate sector (in US$ million) \n1990s \n497.4 \n37.6 \n\n2000\u201306 \n1283.6 \n52.1 \n\n1980s \n35.1 \n10.8 \n\nSource: R. Nangia (2007). \n \nIt is evident that ADB lending to infrastructure both in the private and public sector has been \ninstrumental  in  developing  infrastructure  in  the  Asian  region.  However,  given  the  huge \ninfrastructure  needs  of  the  Asian  region,  especially  the  South,  several  novel,  alternate \nmeans  of  financing  infrastructure,  such  as  defense  offsets,  have  been  highlighted  in  the \nliterature in recent years.  \n\n5.3. Defense Offsets (An Alternate Means of Financing Infrastructure) \n\nThe  importance  of  offsets  in  the  global  defense  trade  has  been  growing  over  the  last  two \ndecades.  Today  most  developed  and  developing  nations  have  some  sort  of  offset \nprogramme,  frequently  either  to  protect  their  own  defense  industries,  or  to  assist  in  the \nfurther  development  and  enhancement  of  burgeoning  indigenous  defense  industrial \ncapabilities. In the modern defense business industry, offset has become an essential part of \nany  proposed  defense  equipment  package,  with  many  nations  increasingly  paying  greater \nattention to the offset proposals contained within the supplier\u2019s proposal packages.  \n \nFrequently, offset packages are the determining factor in the decision-taking process as far \nas to whom contracts are awarded. It is known that, in some countries, it is the details of the \noffset packages put forward by competing contractors which is looked at and assessed first, \neven before other parts of the tender are examined.  \n \nThe US Department of Commerce, Fifth Annual Report on Offsets in Defense Trade (2001) \nstates  that,  \u201cSome  governments  readily  admit  that  they  are  no  longer  concerned  with  the \nprice  or  quality  of  the  defense  system  purchased,  but  rather  with  the  scope  of  the  offset \npackage  offered.  Recently,  the  Czech  Republic  announced  that  in  competition  for  its  jet \nfighter  procurement,  offsets  would  be  the  deciding  factor  as  opposed  to  technical  and \nperformance criteria and price.\u201d \n \nOffsets in defense trade can be both direct and indirect. Some of the examples of direct and \nindirect offsets are as follows: \n \n\n \n\n\u2022  Direct \n\n \n\n\u2022 \n\ntransfer,  co-production, \n\nTechnology \nlocal  assembly \n(components;  platforms),  parts  manufacture,  creation  of  authorized  regional \nservice centers, purchase of defense components from the customer country. \n\ninstallation, \n\nlocal \n\nIndirect \nIndustrial  projects,  employment  creation,  skills  transfer,  student  sponsorships, \nbuilding  of  schools  and  colleges, \ninvestment \npromotion,  export  development,  management  skills  (IT;  packaging;  quality \nstandards; marketing).  \n\ninfrastructure  development, \n\n \nThe  importance  of  offsets  for  developing  economies,  like  India\u2019s,  is  immense.  Currently, \nmore  than  120  developed  and  developing  countries  have  some  sort  of  economic offset  for \npurchase of aircraft\u2019s and defense technology. Offsets account for between 10\u201315% of world \nto  major  civil  programs  such  as  commercial  aircraft, \ntrade  and  now  applies \n\n25 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 80 \n \n\n \n\nGeethanjali Nataraj \n\ntelecommunications,  and  power  generation.  It  is  a  buyer\u2019s  market  and  India,  with  its  huge \nimport  of  defense-related  equipment  and  capital  goods,  must  leverage  from  its  defense \ndeals.  However,  in  comparison  to  its  other  developing  counterparts  like  Brazil  and  the \nPhilippines, India has not leveraged much from its offset arrangements and, in fact, does not \nappear  to  have  a  formal  offset  policy  in  place.  Though  in  the  past  India  has  struck  a  few \noffset  deals  involving  technology  transfer  to  build  the  domestic  defense  industry,  counter \ntrade, and long term credit arrangements, it certainly has not capitalized on its defense deals \nas much as it could or should have. A long term offset policy will go a long way in meeting \nthe country\u2019s investment needs, especially in sectors like infrastructure. \n \nAccording  to  the  India  Infrastructure  Report  (2006),18 currently  5.5%  of  GDP  is  invested  in \nthe infrastructure sector. This needs to be increased to 8% in the fiscal year 2007\u20132008, by \nwhich time the annual level of investment in infrastructural facilities is projected to treble or \nmore, from the current level of US$60 billion, to US$130 billion by the end 2007. And given \nthe  infrastructure  requirements  of  nearly  US$150  billion  over  the  next  5  years  and  an \nincrease  in  India\u2019s  capital  goods  imports  in  the  coming  years,  having  an  offset  policy  and \nleveraging  big  deals  in  the  defense  sector  is  an  important  policy  option  which  the  country \nmust optimize.   \n \nIn  the  literature,  a  new  word  to  describe  offsets  is  \u201cEconomic  Enhancement\u201d  (EE).  The \nultimate objective of EE is to leverage a government\u2019s buying power to provide the maximum \nbenefit to a country\u2019s economy. Some of the major benefits of an offset policy include: \n \n\n1.  Aid  in  economic  diversification  and  realizing  goals  set  within  the  national  economic \n\ndevelopment plan. \n\n2.  Reduce the cost of major government procurements to the economy. \n3.  Provide diversification of the economic base. \n4.  Encourage FDI. \n5.  Import substitution. \n6.  Create export markets for goods produced locally. \n7.  New employment opportunities for local nationals. \n8.  Technology transfer. \n\n \nAs mentioned earlier, nearly 130 countries have an offset policy in place. The use of offsets \nin non-defense-related areas is on the rise. It is believed that India\u2019s requirement of defense \ngoods is assessed to be around Rs. 200 billion yearly. Of this, imports alone constitute Rs. \n100 billion a year. Thus, India being a major arms importer, offsets could be a good route to \nprocure  much  needed  infrastructure  investment  and  reap  other  benefits  of  technology \ntransfer,  employment  generation,  and,  above  all,  make  the  Indian  defense  sector \ninternationally competitive and self-reliant.  \n\n6. THE INDIAN EXPERIENCE WITH PPPS: GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES \n\nKey  government  initiatives. 19  The  Indian  Department  of  Economic  Affairs  (DEA)  has \nhighlighted  that  the  Government  of  India  (GOI)  is  committed  to  raising  the  investment  in \ninfrastructure from its existing level of 4.7% of GDP to around 8%. Infrastructure shortages \nare  proving  a  key  constraint  in  sustaining  and  expanding  India\u2019s  economic  growth  and \nmaking it more inclusive for the poor. The government is actively promoting PPPs in the key \ninfrastructure  sectors  of  transport  (including  railways),  power,  urban  infrastructure,  and \ntourism. PPPs are seen as an important tool for producing an accelerated and larger pipeline \n\n                                               \n18  India Infrastructure Report (2006), 3I network, Oxford University Press, New Delhi, India. \n19 The  section  on  initiatives  by  the  Government  of  India  is  largely  taken  from  the  ADB\u2019s  regional  workshop  on \n\nPPP\u2019s held in December 2006 in India for the Chief Secretaries of Indian states. \n\n26 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 80 \n \n\n \n\nGeethanjali Nataraj \n\nof  infrastructure  investments,  and  reducing  the  country\u2019s  infrastructure  deficit.  A  PPP \ndepartment has been established in the DEA to administer various proposals and coordinate \nactivities to promote PPPs. \n \nViability  Gap  Funding  (VGF)  scheme.  The  GOI  has  established  the  VGF  scheme  as  a \nspecial  facility  to  support  the  financial  viability  of  those  infrastructure  projects  which  are \neconomically  justifiable  but  not  commercially  viable  in  the  immediate  future.  It  involves \nupfront  grant  assistance  of  up  to  20%  of  the  project  cost  for  state  or  central  level  PPP \nprojects  that  are  implemented  by  a  private  sector  developer  who  is  selected  through \ncompetitive  bidding.  An  Empowered  Committee  has  been  set  up  for  quick  processing  of \ncases.  \n \nFacilitating  Public-Private  Partnership.  GOI  has  established  India  Infrastructure Finance \nCompany  Limited  (IIFCL)  as  a  wholly  government-owned  company  to  provide  long-term \nfinance to infrastructure projects, either directly or through refinancing. The IIFCL caters to \nthe  growing  financing  gap  in  long-term  financing  of  infrastructure  projects  in  the  public, \nprivate, and PPP sectors. Any government project awarded to a private sector company for \ndevelopment, financing, and construction through PPP will have overriding priority under the \nscheme. GOI is working on a number of initiatives to assist and encourage capacity-building \nat  the  state  and  central  levels.  It  is  identifying  the  capacity-building  needs  of  state \ngovernments  and  providing  assistance  for  the  creation  of  state-level  PPP  cells  such  as  a \nnodal  agency,  streamlining  the  PPP  approval  process,  developing  PPP  toolkits,  model \nconcession agreements (MCAs), bidding documents, and project preparation manuals. GOI \nis also building a central database and website on PPPs to disseminate updated information \nto  the  states  and  the  private  sector.  Arrangements  are  being  finalized  under  which,  state \ngovernments would be able to avail themselves of consultancy support for developing PPP \nprojects.  Institutions  like  the  ADB  have  begun  supporting  the  capacity-building  process \nthrough these workshops and proposed technical assistance projects. \n \nStatus of PPPs and States\u2019 perspectives. Eighty-six PPPs have been awarded in India so \nfar, totaling about Rs 340 billion, in twelve states and three central agencies. Roads and port \nsectors  have  dominated  in  the  number  and  size  of  PPPs.  As  of  October  2006,  twelve \nproposals were given in-principle approval under VGF. State governments have identified a \nwhole  range  of  sectors  for  PPPs,  including  roads  and  highways,  ports  (air,  sea,  and \ncontainer), telecommunication, water supply, waste management, tourism, power, industrial \ninfrastructure,  township  development,  leisure,  and  health.  States  have  also  identified \npotential PPP projects that could be developed over the next few years. Many of the projects \nare  already  in  the  bidding  stage  using  both  memorandum  of  understanding  (MOU)  and \ncompetitive bidding procedures. Not many of these projects would require VGF funding. No \nclear  link  between  institutional  structure  and  success  of  a  PPP  has  become  apparent. \nState/Union Territory (UT) governments have indicated marked differences in the process of \nPPP development, including variations in existence of infrastructure legislation and policies, \ninstitutional  arrangements  for  identifying  and  approving  PPPs,  project  development  funds \nand companies, financial structuring, and procurement procedures. \n \nRequirements  of  Central  Assistance.  The  states  highlighted  a  number  of  areas  where \nguidance,  assistance,  and  technical  support  are  required  from  GOI.  These  areas  are: \nVGF(viability  gap  funding);  quicker  approval  procedures;  relaxation  of  the  project  details \ncurrently  required  for  an  in-principle  approval;  inclusion  of  projects  awarded  through  the \nSpecial Purpose Vehicle (SPV) route and not competitive bidding, like railways; inclusion of \nrural  sector  projects  and  unfinished  projects;  inclusion  of  land  costs  under  VGF  financing, \ncapacity-building,  setting  up  PPP  cells  at  the  state  level;  access  to  project  development \nresources;  advisory  support  on  infrastructure  legislation  and  regulatory  frameworks  and \ndetailed PPP policies; model PPP execution cycle; contract monitoring and time scheduling; \nguidelines  on  public  sector  comparator  (PSC)  and  its  comparison  with  the  private  sector \n\n27 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 80 \n \n\n \n\nGeethanjali Nataraj \n\npredictor; information on potential sources of long-term debt; and formalization of state PPP \nplans.  The  states  have  also  called  for  streamlining  of  the  statutory  clearances  on \nenvironment, defense, airport authority, land acquisition, etc. \n \nPrivate  Sector  Perspectives.  The  private  sector  recognizes  the  enormous  business \nopportunity  of  PPPs  in  India  and  has  welcomed  the  Government  of  India\u2019s  PPP  initiatives. \nThe  private  sector  has  urged  the  government  to  publicize  the  size  of  the  business \nopportunity for PPPs in India to the private sector, which is estimated to be much more than \nhas been previously thought. Given the enormous investment requirements in infrastructure \ndevelopment,  the  need  for  a  sustainable  pipeline  of  PPP  projects  has  become  paramount. \nThe  private  sector  remains  eager  to  see  more  substantive  reforms,  enabling  changes  by \ngovernment in the policy, regulatory provisions, and procurement procedures for PPPs. \n \nImprovements in India\u2019s enabling environment. The private sector has called for changes \nin  India\u2019s  enabling  environment  and  suggested  measures  to  foster  efficiency  and \ntransparency  in  the  bidding  process,  ensure  sanctity  of  contracts,  encourage  competition, \npromote  market-driven  tariffs,  and  separate  regulatory  and  adjudication  authorities.  It  has \ncalled  for  developing  appropriate  legislative  framework  for  PPPs,  clarification  of  entry \nconditions, suitable contractual structures, and clarification of incentives and concessions. \n \nStandardized  procurement  procedures.  Given  the  variations  in  the  formats,  bidding \nprocedures,  agreements,  and  overall  execution  of  PPPs  among  the  various  states  and \nagencies,  the  private  sector  has  highlighted  the  need  for  standardized  prequalification  and \nbidding  procedures  and  guidelines  for  ensuring  efficiency,  predictability,  and  ease  of \napproval process. \n \nTransparency.  The  need  for  maintaining  transparency  in  the  entire  PPP  project  cycle  and \nstakeholder interactions has been noted as a key factor in determining the success of PPPs. \nThe  private  sector  has  urged  the  central  and  state  governments  and  other  public  sector \nproject sponsors to be cautious of the \u201cselection by nomination\u201d20 procedure, which is not the \nsame as transparently awarded PPP contracts. \n \nProject  development  and  structuring  facility.  A  major  impediment  to  successful \ncommercialization  of  projects \nthe  absence  of  rigorous  project \nIndia  has  been \ndevelopment.  Many  of  the  projects  put  out  for  bidding  by  GOI  have  been  inadequately \nstructured  and  unsuitable  for  a  PPP.  A  project  development  facility  (PDF)  that  provides \nproject sponsors, the resources to procure consultancy, and expert services for conducting \npre-feasibility studies and assessments is required. \n \nPublic sector capacity to successfully execute PPPs. The private sector has highlighted \nits  concerns  about  the  absence  of  a  robust  pipeline  of  bankable  PPP  projects.  This  is \nattributed  to  insufficient  capacity  of  the  PPP-sponsoring  public  entities  to  identify  and \nimplement  deals  and  execute  PPPs.  Capacity  deficit  is  seen  as  the  crucial  bottleneck  in \nachieving a steady flow of successfully negotiated PPP deals. \n \nPublic  sector  reforms,  with  or  without  PPPs.  The  infrastructure  sector  suffers  from \nsupply-side  constraints.  The  PPP  experience  in  various  states  has  shown  that  procedures \nand  processes  have  been  extremely  dilatory.  The  infrastructure  sector  needs  to  urgently \nimplement  public  sector  reforms  to  address  supply-side  constraints.  Changes  in  delivery \nmechanisms, processes, procedures, and institutional structures need to be tailored towards \nclient-focused  outcomes  and  results.  Land  acquisition  and  environmental  clearances  are \nbest obtained by governments. Social and environmental clearances are also best obtained \n                                               \n20 In  selection  by  nomination  an  expert  panel  or  committee  that  is  set  up  directly  awards  the  contract  to  a \n\nin \n\nperson/party and the process is not transparent.  \n\n28 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 80 \n \n\n \n\nGeethanjali Nataraj \n\nby government and not by the private partner. Several projects have stalled with huge time \nand  cost  overruns  due  to  delays  in  land  acquisition  and  transfer  of  land  possession  to  the \nprivate sector. The private sector could deliver much faster if these clearances were handled \nby  the  project  sponsor. Building  in environmental  and  social  dimensions  of  PPPs  needs  to \nbe made part of the project development cycle. \n \nGenuine  and  mutually  rewarding  partnerships.  PPPs  represent  partnerships  in  action \nwith  huge  stakes  for  both  the  public  sector  and  private  sector  agencies  to  succeed \ncollectively.  It  is  important  that  the  public  and  private  sector  work  together,  keeping  the \nproject and outcomes in focus rather than maximizing their own interests, and collaborating \nfor  mutually  enduring  value.  PPPs  are  a  new  way  of  doing  business  and  are  not  about \ncommand and control. Ultimately, the project partners need to remember that PPPs are not \nabout finance, but about improving the quality and efficiency of public services. \n\n6.1. Public-private Partnerships in Pakistan and Sri Lanka \n\nis  attributable \n\nThe  concept  of  PPPs  in  other  countries  of  South  Asia,  such  as  Pakistan,  Bangladesh,  Sri \nLanka, and Nepal, is not as well established as it is in India. Though many PPP projects in \ninfrastructure  have  been  implemented  in  these  countries,  the  total  number  of  projects  and \ntotal investment in these projects has been negligible. In Pakistan, PPPs were non-existent \nup until the last two or three years. A few instances of BOT-type PPPs have been found in \ntelecommunication, power generation, and the setting up of an oil terminal at Karachi port by \nthe  private  sector.  No  projects  have  emerged  for  private  participation  in  water  supply  and \nsanitation  although  there  have  been  attempts  to  have  private  sector  involvement  in  solid \nwaste  management.  The  overall  lack  of  investment  in  infrastructure  through  PPPs  in \nPakistan \nin \ncommissioning and executing PPPs in infrastructure. There is also a lack of resources and \npackaging projects that could be successfully offered for financing.   \n \nIn  contrast  to  Pakistan,  the  experience  of  Sri  Lanka  with  PPPs  has  been  fairly  good.  Sri \nLanka in recent years has been spending 3.5% of GDP on infrastructure development. The \ngovernment of Sri Lanka set up the Bureau of Infrastructure Investment with enough funds \nfor  private  investors  to  borrow.  Success  stories  include  the  Colombo  port,  Sri  Lankan \nAirlines,  and  telecommunications  projects.  However,  these  were  not  BOT  or  BOO,  though \nthey did involve PPP via divestiture of shares below 50% to the private sector. Sri Lanka has \ntaken the help of the Indian government and emulated in its own country the success of the \nNational  Highway  PPP  project  in  India.  The  problem  in  Sri  Lanka  is  not  the  lack  of  private \nfinances for infrastructure projects but managing the transition for private sector involvement.  \n\nlack  of  experience  and  capacity \n\nthe  government\u2019s \n\nto \n\n6.2. Global lessons for India \n\nThough PPPs are a relatively new approach to procurement, lessons may be drawn from the \nexperiences of developed and developing countries on the conditions for successful PPPs. \nAs  a  relatively  late  entrant  into  the  PPP  development  process,  India  can  learn  and  benefit \nfrom the lessons and experiences of countries that have established PPP programs, such as \nMexico, Chile, the United States, and the Philippines. These lessons are: \n\n1.  Detailed PPP policy and planning. This is to bolster the confidence and attract the \nparticipation  of  private  investors  and  commercial  lenders.  Governments  need  to \ndevelop a policy on unsolicited proposals from the private sector. PPPs can succeed \nonly if they are structured and planned in detail, and are managed by expert teams. \nGovernments  also  need  to  use  technical  and  financial  advisors  where  needed,  to \nmatch  the  advantages  of  the  private  sector,  particularly  in  large-scale  programs. \nProject  development  needs  to  be  done  by  government,  which  needs  to  invest  in \ndevelopment by creating dedicated funds. \n\n29 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 80 \n \n\n \n\nGeethanjali Nataraj \n\n2.  Proper  allocation  of  risks. Effective PPP models involve sensible division of roles \nand  fair  sharing  of  responsibilities,  costs,  and  risks  between  the  public  and  private \nsectors. Optimal, not maximum, assignment of risk is the principle that needs to be \nadopted. \n\n3.  Provide  adequate  protection  for  lenders.  Public  private  partnerships  should  be \ndesigned in such a way so as to provide adequate protection to debt service against \nnon-commercial risks related to force major regulatory changes, contract termination, \netc. Avoiding renegotiations and midway changes to save costs and delays will also \nhelp secure lenders. A concession agreement should be structured in such a manner \nas  to  cover  all  possible  causes  of  later  adjustments,  leaving  minimum  room  for \nrenegotiations.  A  key \nthat \ngovernments  often  become  over-enthusiastic  to  procure  private  sector  participation \nby offering excessively concessional terms to the project company. This needs to be \navoided. \n\ninternational  experience \n\nlearned \n\nlesson \n\nfrom \n\nis \n\n4.  Development  of  public  sector  capacity.  Public  sector  capacity  to  prioritize,  plan, \nappraise,  structure,  bid,  and  financially  close  PPPs  remains  the  top-most  challenge \nto the mainstreaming of PPPs at the state and central levels. \n\n5.  Full  and  clear  support  by  government.  Support  for  the  PPP  program  and  for \nspecific  PPP  projects  has  to  come  from  the  highest  political  level  of  government. \nStrong political will is essential in overcoming resistance and needs to be seen as a \nclear sign of the government\u2019s intention to meet its contractual commitments.  \n\n6.  Proactive  public  communication  and  stakeholder  management.  Many  PPPs \nhave  failed  due  to  strong  opposition  from  civil  society,  local  media,  and  other \nstakeholders.  Feedback  and  consultations  with  citizens,  labor  unions,  relevant \ngovernment  agencies,  private  investors,  civil  society  organizations,  and  media  will \nensure public support, client focus, and improved coordination of the project. \n\n7.  Role  of  multilateral  agencies.  Multilateral  agencies  have  welcomed  the  recent \nsteps  taken  by  GOI  with  respect  to  VGF  and  IIFCL.  Agencies  like  ADB  and  World \nBank  could  assist  GOI  in  promoting  PPPs  across  sectors  and  regions  of  India, \nthrough a range of financing, advisory and technical assistance (TA) measures. Most \nimportantly, these agencies would be able to assist GOI in tailoring PPP solutions to \nspecific demands of the individual states, sectors, and projects.  \n\n8.  Support  capacity-building.  State  presentations  have  highlighted  the  need  for \ncentral assistance in capacity-building and have underlined this as critical in the long-\nterm success of PPPs at the state level. In response to a request from the DEA and \nbased  on  the  feedback  from  a  workshop  series,  ADB  has  agreed  to  extend  TA  to \ngovernments  in  order  to  mainstream  PPPs  at  the  central  and  state  levels  via \ncapacity-building  support,  including  assistance  in  the  establishment  of  PPP  cells  at \nstate levels.  \n\n9.  Potential financing options for PPPs. ADB has re-engineered and operationalized \nnew  ways  of  doing  business  to  provide  more  client-oriented  services  for  state  and \ncentral  level  infrastructure  development  initiatives.  ADB  may  also  consider  if \nnecessary,  extending  loans  (multi-tranche  financing  facility,  local  currency  loan)  to \nqualified  projects  in  several  forms.  These  forms  include:  (i)  public  sector  loans  to \nstates/municipalities/executing  agencies  for  financing  counter-grants/equity  support, \nland,  or  engineering  design;  (ii)  public  sector  loans  to  IIFCL  (financial  intermediary \nloan)  which  would,  in  turn,  provide  funds  to  project  companies;  (iii)  private  sector \nloans or equity investments by the private sector operation arm of the ADB to project \ncompanies; and, (iv) provision of guarantee to commercial lenders. \n\n30 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 80 \n \n\n \n\nGeethanjali Nataraj \n\n7. CONCLUSION AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS \n\nUntil  the  early  1990s,  governments  basically  monopolized  the  infrastructure  sectors  in  the \nSouth  Asian  region.  Thus  governments  had  a  two-fold  role\u2014they  were  policy  makers  and \nregulators  while  they  simultaneously  owned  the  companies  that  provided  infrastructure \nservices. Governments were responsible for guaranteeing an adequate infrastructure for the \npopulation  but  also  had  to  ensure  that  providers  had  sufficient  resources  to  invest  in \nexpanding their services. However, the weak financial situation of most infrastructure sectors \nand an inadequate access to services showed that governments were not able to adequately \nfulfill these roles.  \n\n \nFrom the early to mid-1990s, countries in the South Asian region saw a wave of initiatives \naimed at attracting private investment in their infrastructure sectors. The perception was that \nif  the  enormous  investment  needs  of  the  countries  were  to  be  met,  private  foreign  capital \nwould  have  to  be  attracted.  Soon  it  became  apparent  that  such  investments  would  not  be \nforthcoming  solely  on  the  basis  of  policy  statements.  It  became  apparent  that  private \ninvestors  were  concerned  about  the  conflicts  arising  from  the  multiple  roles  played  by \ngovernments  in  the  region.  As  a  result,  governments  agreed  to  establish  independent \nregulatory commissions in key infrastructure sectors. Governments hoped that this measure \nwould also reduce the perceived political risk of investing in infrastructure sectors.  \n \nIndividual  South  Asian  countries  have  focused  their  reform  efforts  on  different  sectors.  For \nexample,  in  Sri  Lanka  a  reform  of  the  telecommunications  sector  was  given  priority.  India \nhas  embarked  on  major  reform  programs  in  both  electricity  and  telecommunications  and \nreform  proposals  for  petroleum  and  natural  gas  are  underway.  Bangladesh  is  proposing  a \nsingle regulatory structure for electricity and natural gas. In all these countries, the ultimate \nobjective is to improve efficiency in these sectors and attract private investments to develop \ninfrastructure.  \n \nA close examination of private sector initiatives and PPPs shows the following constraints for \nPPPs in South Asia, specifically in countries with large economies, such as India: \n \n\n\u2022  There  is  a  weakness  in  government  enabling  policies  and  regulatory  framework. \nSubstantial  work  needs  to  be  done  to  make  sector  policies  and  regulations  PPP-\nfriendly. In an economy like India\u2019s, for instance, a large number of these projects are \nin the states and without the active participation of the states it would not be possible \nto achieve satisfactory results.  \n\n \n\u2022  The  market  presently  does  not  have  adequate  instruments  and  capacity  to  meet \n\nlong-term equity and debt financing needed by infrastructure projects. \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022  There  is  also  a  lack  of  credible,  bankable  infrastructure  projects,  which  could  be \noffered for financing to the private sector. Some initiatives have been taken both at \nthe  central  as  well  as  the  state  level  to  develop  PPP  projects.  These  tend  to  be \nisolated cases and have demonstrated a marked lack of consistency.  \n\n\u2022  There is also a lack of capacity in public institutions and officials to manage the PPP \nprocess. As these projects involve long term contracts covering the life cycle of the \ninfrastructure  asset  being  created,  it  is  necessary  to  manage  this  process  to \nmaximize returns to all shareholders.  \n\n31 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 80 \n \n\n \n\nPolicy suggestions \n\nGeethanjali Nataraj \n\nBuild  consensus  for  PPPs.  There  is  little  consensus  among  stakeholders  on  the \nbenefits of involving the private sector in infrastructure development\u2014especially in power \nand  water  utilities\u2014in  part  due  to  ideological  opposition  and  limited  experience  with \nprivate  participation.  Moving  ahead  successfully  with  PPP  projects  in  the  medium-term \nwill  require  continued  efforts  to  build  awareness  of  the  positive  experiences  of  PPPs, \nhold consultations with policy-makers and other key stakeholders on the range of options \nfor  PPPs,  and  address  stakeholders\u2019  concerns  at  the  beginning  of  the  planning  and \ndesign stage.  \n \nMove  toward  cost  recovery. Prices for infrastructure services in South Asia generally \ncover  only  a  small  share  of  the  costs.  Public  and  political  opposition  to  involving  the \nprivate sector often rests on concerns about price increases and exclusion of the poor. \nTo be politically acceptable, a move toward cost recovery is likely to be gradual and must \nbe accompanied by efforts to reduce inefficiency. In addition, the design of PPP projects \nshould include innovate ways to deliver subsidies to the poor.21 \n \nEstablish PPP professional units. Countries involved in PPPs on a large scale need to \nset  up  dedicated,  cross-sectoral  professional  units  to  support  project  implementation, \nwith  responsibilities  ranging  from  disseminating  information  and  preparing  guidelines  to \ndesigning  and  implementing  transactions.  These  units  can  guide  and  complement  the \nefforts  of  line  ministries  and  provincial  governments  to  develop  frameworks  for  PPPs, \nmethodologies  for  evaluating  PPP  options  and  associated  fiscal  costs,  standard \ncontracts, guidance on managing the bid process, and monitoring and evaluation tools.  \n \nEase  financing  constraints.  Financing  infrastructure  projects  is  a  challenge  in  South \nAsian  countries,  where  financial  markets  are  shallow  and  there  are  limited  options  for \nfinancing  long  term  projects.  To  ease  financing  constraints,  priorities  should  include: \ndeveloping  longer-term  bond  markets;  developing  investment  policies  and  regulatory \nguidelines that encourage banks, insurance companies, pensions and mutual finds, and \nother  financial  institutions  to  help  finance  infrastructure  projects;  and,  encouraging  the \nuse  of  innovative  financing  instruments  to  mitigate  lender\u2019s  risks.  To  help  close  the \nfunding  gap,  the  governments  of  Bangladesh,  India,  and  Pakistan  are  establishing \nfacilities to provide long term finance for infrastructure projects.  \n \n\nThe opportunities for private investment in infrastructure projects are immense. As the reach \nof  PPPs  increases  across  sectors,  the  capacity  of  the  private  sector  to  manage  these \nprojects over their entire life cycles of two to thirty years will also have to be enhanced. As \ngovernments  move  forward  with  PPP  programs,  the  factor  most  critical  to  success  will  be \ntheir commitment to minimizing the constraints to private participation.  \n\n                                               \n21  The  policy  implications  are  in  part  drawn  from  the  Gridlines,  Note  No.  6,  May  2006  (Public-Private \nInfrastructure  advisory  facility)  of  the  World  Bank  titled,  \u201cLifting  constraints  to  Public-Private  Partnerships  in \nSouth Asia,\u201d by Bhavna Bhatia and Neeraj Gupta.  \n\n32 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 80 \n \n\n \n\nGeethanjali Nataraj \n\nReferences \n\n \nArndt, R. 1999.  \u201cIs build-own-operate transfer a solution to local government\u2019s infrastructure \n\nfunding problems?\u201d Taking Engineering to Government; transactions of \nmultidisciplinary engineering, BOT type of construction procurement. 5(1), August, \n42\u201357. \n\n \nAsian  Development  Bank,  ADB\u2019s  Infrastructure  Operations:  Responding  to  Client  Needs, \n\nMarch 2007, Manila. \n\n \nBiehl, D Ed. 1986.
