INTRODUCTION \nThe importance of infrastructure for overall economic development and enhancement of \ntrade and business activity in a country need hardly be emphasized. Infrastructure reflects \ncredibility, confidence, low-cost production, and market competitiveness. South Asia has \nbecome one of the fastest growing regions in the world with growth rate of around 7% in last \nfew years. The region, which accounts for around one quarter of the world\u2019s population and \naround 40% of world\u2019s poor, needs to continue with this growth momentum in a sustainable \nmanner in order to raise the overall standard of living and reduce poverty. The importance of \nphysical  infrastructure  for  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  has  been  well \ndocumented in the literature (Estache, 2004; Jones, 2004; Asian Development Bank [ADB], \n20051). Furthermore, investment in physical and social infrastructure positively affects the \npoor directly and indirectly in multiple ways. Investment climate surveys repeatedly show \nthat the limited and poor quality of infrastructure facilities act as a major impediment to \nbusiness growth in South Asia. Against this backdrop, South Asian countries are making \nconcerted  efforts  to  improve  infrastructure  capacities  in  their  countries.  However,  the \ninfrastructure construction industry in South Asian economies is characterized by a vicious \ncycle of inefficiency\u2014facilities remain almost entirely in the public sector and are plagued \nwith problems related to inefficiency and weak governance. This, in turn, yields poor cost \nrecovery and conflicting incentives to provide efficient, expandable, and reliable services.  \nThe role of adequate infrastructure for economic development has been well documented in \nthe literature (Biehl, 1986; World Bank, 1994; Ferreira and Khatami, 1996; Maree, 1996; \nArndt, 1999). In the Asia Pacific region, infrastructure projects\u2014roads, ports, power, and \npublic  utilities\u2014have  traditionally  been  established,  owned,  and  managed  by  the  state. \nGenerally, the projects are financed through taxes or by borrowing from commercial banks \nand international financial institutions, such as World Bank and Asian Development Bank \n(ADB).  The  role  of  the  private  sector  has  been  relatively  limited,  usually  restricted  to \nsubcontracting during the construction phase. However, over the last two decades, all this \nhas changed. Demand for infrastructure investment has increased dramatically in response \nto the rapid industrialization and urbanization that has occurred in most of the region\u2019s \ndeveloping economies (Maree, 1996; Arndt, 1999) and even more so in the fastest growing \neconomies, such as in India. Governments are no longer able to finance infrastructure \nprojects  solely  or  even  predominantly  from  the  public  purse  (Noel  and  Brzeski,  2005; \nGrinmsey and Lewis, 2004). All South Asian countries face budgetary constraints due to, \namong other things, declining terms of trade for primary commodities, the high cost of debt \nservicing, increasing revenue expenditures, and smaller aid flows. Governments are also \nunder pressure from multilateral agencies to strengthen fiscal discipline as a part of their on-\ngoing structural reforms. Therefore, governments have reduced their involvement in the \ndesign, construction, and management of infrastructure projects. Governments are looking \nto the private sector to not only finance but also build and operate infrastructure assets. \nHowever, there are some difficult issues relating to institutional set up, financing, regulatory \nauthorities,  tariffs,  and  Public-Private  Partnerships  (PPPs).  In  recent  times,  PPPs  have \nemerged as an undoubtedly vital tool in building, managing, and operating infrastructure \nservices efficiently. \nThis  study  is  intended  to  carry  out  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  trends  in  infrastructure \navailability in South Asia, to look at the demand-supply gap in infrastructure, and to review \nthe  issues  related  to  infrastructure  financing  from  both  the  public  and  private  sector \nperspectives.  \n                                               \n1 ADB\u2019s Infrastructure Operations: Responding to Client Needs, March 2007, Manila.  ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 80    Geethanjali Nataraj \n \n \nGiven the increasing importance of private sector participation in infrastructure development, \nthis research provides an increased understanding of whether and under what conditions \ndeveloping economies in South Asia can benefit from PPPs to fund and finance much \nneeded major infrastructure projects. This study also examines the constraints faced by the \nprivate sector in the region and, finally, attempts to provide policy recommendations to South \nAsian  governments  on  improving  the  economic  environment  for  PPPs,  enhancing \ncompetition,  productivity,  quality,  and  delivery  systems  for  infrastructure  projects  in  the \nregion.  \n \nFurthermore, a study of the possible sources of infrastructure financing in South Asian \ncountries may not only solve infrastructural bottlenecks but may also have an impact on the \neconomic  well-being  of  South  Asian  countries  through  increased  employment  in \ninfrastructure  projects  and  related  industries,  not  to  mention  the  fact  that  infrastructure \ndevelopment is a critical determinant of economic growth and foreign direct investment (FDI) \nin the region. Section 2 of the study gives an overview of major economic indicators of South \nAsia\u2014including infrastructure indicators, points out the trends in private sector investment \nfor infrastructure development in the region, and provides estimates of infrastructure needs \nof the region. Section 3 presents a comprehensive analysis of the PPPs, their meaning, and \nthe different types of PPPs. Section 4 deals with private sector participation in infrastructure-\nbuilding in developing economies and Asia, with particular emphasis on South Asia. This \nsection also presents major findings with respect to PPPs in the Asian region. Section 5 \noutlines the support of multilateral institutions in supporting infrastructure development in the \nregion and also brings out alternative means of financing infrastructure, for instance, through \ndefense offsets. Section 6 presents India\u2019s experience with PPPs along with the cases of Sri \nLanka and Pakistan. Section 7 presents the conclusion.  \n2. ECONOMIC TRENDS AND INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS IN ASIA: AN OVERVIEW \nThe world economy is expected to grow at a rate of 2.7% per annum in the first decade of \nthe new millennium. As a result, there will be an increase in demand for infrastructure \nservices  for  both  consumption  and  production  purposes\u2014not  meeting  this  increased \ndemand will cause bottlenecks to growth and hamper poverty alleviation efforts. \n \nSouth Asia has done well in recent years, exhibiting high growth in spite of inherent political \ninstability  in  Bangladesh,  Nepal,  and,  to  a  certain  extent,  Pakistan.  Other  natural  and \nunforeseen calamities have also greatly affected the region (Table 1). There are several \nfactors that would help to sustain these high growth rates but, as of now, the most important \nfactor is undoubtedly improvement of infrastructure. Despite the liberalization process in \nmany countries of the region, South Asia\u2019s regulations for industry, labor, finance, and taxes \ncontinue to limit the region\u2019s growth and employment potential. According to the ADB2, \nelectricity,  water,  road,  rail,  airports,  and  port  services  are  poor  through  out  the  area. \nImprovements in every country as well as intra-regional connections would yield substantial \nbenefits by reducing the costs of production and trade (Table 1).  \n \n                                               \n2 Ibid. \n2 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 80    Geethanjali Nataraj \n \nTable 1: Growth Rate of GDP in South Asia: 2002\u20132008  \n(in percentage per year) \n \nCountry  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007*  2008* \nSouth Asia  3.7  7.8  7.4  8.7  8.7  7.7  8.0 \nBangladesh  4.4  5.3  6.3  6.0  6.7  6.5  7.0 \nIndia  3.8  8.5  7.5  9.0  9.2  8.0  8.3 \nPakistan   3.1  4.7  7.5  8.6  6.6  6.8  6.5 \nSri Lanka  4.0  6.0  5.4  6.0  7.2  6.1  6.0 \nNepal  -0.4  3.0  3.5  2.3  2.3  2.8  2.8 \nSouth-East  4.8  5.3  6.5  5.6  6.0  5.6  5.9 \nAsia \nPRC   9.1  10.0  10.1  10.4  10.7  10.0  9.8 \nSource: Asian Development Outlook: 2007 \nNotes:  \n1.* Refers to forecasts. \n2.

PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China \n \nApart  from  experiencing  high  growth  rates,  the  region  has  also  built  up  large  foreign \nexchange reserves of nearly US$250 billion. In addition, gross domestic investment as a \npercentage of gross domestic product (GDP) has also increased in all the countries of the \nregion. For instance, in 2005, gross domestic savings as a percentage of GDP was nearly \n33.8%  in  India  and  in  Nepal  it  touched  nearly  29%.  FDI,  another  major  source  of \ninfrastructure development funding, has been increasing, although South Asia fairs poorly in \ncomparison  to  neighbouring  South-East  Asia  and  East  Asia,  especially  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC). For example, India managed to attract around US$8 billion in FDI \nin 2005 as compared to the PRC\u2019s US$72 billion in the same year. The distinguishing and \ncommon characteristic of South Asian countries as compared to their neighbours is its \nrecent, rapid economic growth. Can this growth be increased to 8\u201310% and sustained? The \nchallenge is daunting. The higher growth, increase in per capita income, and urbanization \namong  other  things,  will  put  further  demand  on  more  advanced  physical  and  social \ninfrastructure to sustain these trends and also to create productive economic activities. \nImprovement in infrastructure services remains the key to growth and prosperity in the \nregion.  \n2.1. Comparison of Infrastructure Facilities in East and South Asia \nThere is a wide disparity and difference in the level of infrastructure facilities across Asia. \nThere  is  a  marked  difference  in  both  the  overall  level  of  infrastructure  access  among \ncountries and differences in the overall characteristics of infrastructure provision reflecting \npast investment priorities.

However,  India  scores \nsignificantly higher than the PRC in relation to access to improved water resources. Among \nthe countries, Afghanistan, Cambodia, and Myanmar stand out as particularly lagging in \nterms of the proportion of the population connected to key national infrastructure networks. \nThus, this unequal access to infrastructure facilities and levels of infrastructure development \nhave created a huge gap between the advanced developing countries of Asia and the low-\nincome, least-developed countries of the region.  \n2.2. Infrastructure Deficit in Asia \nIn  recent  years,  the  infrastructure  deficit  has  become  the  most  glaring  deficit  that \ngovernments around the world have to deal with. The gap between infrastructure needs and \nthe resources governments possess to meet those needs is ever growing. Many developing \ncountries across the globe, and even more so in South Asia, have congested roads, bridges \nin  need  of  repair,  poorly  maintained  transit  systems  and  recreational  facilities,  and \ndeteriorated  hospitals,  schools,  and  waste  treatment  facilities  all  in  urgent  need  of \nrehabilitation and repair.3 Governments promise many new projects to close the gap, but \noften do not or cannot find the funding to follow through on their promises. These problems, \nin turn, impose large costs on society, from lower productivity to reduced competitiveness to \nan increased number of road and industrial accidents.  \n \nThere is no question that this infrastructure deficit is impeding South Asia\u2019s growth. More \nthan  a  third  of  Indian  firms  surveyed  in  the 2004  Investment  Climate  Assessment  cite \ninfrastructure as a \u201cmajor\u201d or \u201csevere\u201d obstacle to business expansion; in Bangladesh, the \nfigure is 78%. Power is the most critical bottleneck, with transportation a close second. In \nBangladesh, firms experience power shortages 250 days a year; in Nepal, there is a power \nshortage almost every day. As a result, about 40% of firms in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, \nSri  Lanka,  and  Maldives  have  their  own  generators.  Businesses  in  Pakistan and  India \nestimate they lose 5\u20138% in annual sales due to power-related problems.  \n \nSouth Asia is choking with poor quality roads, inefficient ports, and inadequate transport \nservices. India has very few interstate expressways linking its major economic centers and \nonly 3,000 km of four-lane highways. In the last 10 years, the PRC has built 25,000 km of \nfour- to six-lane, access-controlled expressways. The inefficiencies of the Chittagong Port \nhave given Bangladesh all the characteristics of a land-locked country. Indian Railways, the \nsecond-largest rail network in the world, is still burdened with congestion, deteriorating \nquality of its rolling stock, and huge financial losses, though recent financial results have \nshown improvement.  \n \nFortunately, the growth-related pressures on infrastructure, as well as the exceptionally \nfavorable results from reforms in some sectors such as telecommunications, have created \nsome momentum for further reform and investment in infrastructure in South Asia. Pakistan \nhas successfully privatized the Karachi and Faisalabad Electric Supply Companies. Building \non the success of its telecom industry, India has sufficiently reformed its ports and roads to \nattract about US$8 billion in PPPs in its urban and transport sectors.  \n \nHowever, there has not been greater momentum because infrastructure reforms are deeply \npolitical. In India, state government parties that reduce power subsidies to farmers tend to \nlose elections to parties that promise to restore free power. Attempts to rationalize the \nCeylon Electricity Board are resisted by trade unions that see it as the first step in the \nslippery slope towards privatization and job losses. Plans to contract out water services on a \n                                               \n3 Deloitte research study, 2006 \n5 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 80    Geethanjali Nataraj \n \npilot basis in New Delhi\u2014where, despite plenty of supply (250 liters per capita, per day), \nwater is available only a few hours a day\u2014led to such strong protests that the program was \nsuspended. These episodes are teaching policymakers and donors (some of whom had \ntaken  a  politically-blind  approach  to  infrastructure  reform)  that  transparency  and \nconsultations in reforms are essential, that stakeholders should have confidence that their \nvoices are heard, and that the design of reform options reflects what consumers are looking \nfor. In addition to infrastructure, the high cost of bureaucratic red-tape and regulations\u2014sure \nsigns of poor governance\u2014impedes investment in South Asia. More Indian firms rate these \nthings as greater constraints to growth than infrastructure. In the rankings on \u201cease of doing \nbusiness\u201d of all the countries in the world in Doing Business 2006,4 six East Asian countries \nare in the top 30, but no South Asian country is. India ranks 116th out of 155. It takes about \n71 days to start a business in India. Firing a worker in Sri Lanka costs an average of 75 \nweeks of salary. Fortunately, South Asian countries are taking steps to lower these costs. \nPakistan was rated one of the top ten global \u201creformers\u201d last year. To the extent that \ninvestors\u2014especially foreign investors\u2014use changes in the costs of doing business as an \nindicator of future profitability, South Asia stands to gain immensely by concentrating on \nreforming these aspects of the business environment.  \n \nThe strong economic performance of South Asia in recent years has put South Asia on track \nto achieve the Millennium Development Goal of halving poverty by 2015. Long-term growth \nin South Asia is forecast to remain around 5.5% through 2015, reflecting a rising contribution \nto growth from the private sector. However, though the private sector has been contributing \nincreasingly  to  GDP,  this  high  GDP  growth  is  not  sustainable  given  the  infrastructure \nbottlenecks. Infrastructure bottlenecks make the private sector uncompetitive in the market \neconomies of South Asia in the near future. Since infrastructure is predominantly provided \nby  the  public  sector  in  these  countries,  governments  must  try  to  increase  budgetary \nallocation for infrastructure investment or to create an environment that allows for private \nsector participation. Against the backdrop of all South Asian countries facing budgetary \nconstraints, the second best alternative\u2014i.e., private participation and/or PPPs\u2014is a viable \noption.  \n2.3 Infrastructure Needs of Asia \nAccording to ADB-JBIC-WB5 (2005) study, to meet expected infrastructure service needs, \nEast Asia would have to spend about US$165 billion a year from 2006 through 2010\u2014or \nroughly around 6.2% of its GDP annually\u2014on electricity, telecommunications, water and \nsanitation, and major transport networks. These estimates take into account both investment \nand maintenance of assets. In meeting these needs, it is estimated that 65% of expenditure \nwould need to take the form of new investments with the remaining 35% channeled towards \nmaintenance  of  existing  assets.  The  PRC  alone  is  expected  to  account  for  80%  of \ninfrastructure expenditures in the region.  \n \nIn addition, investment requirements for South Asia as given in a World Bank/UNESCAP6 \nstudy indicates that developing Asian and Pacific countries need investments annually of \nUS$228 billion from 2006 to 2010, nearly half of it required for the energy sector. In another \nestimate,  the  Asia-Pacific  Infrastructure  Forum  found  that  the  region's  investment \nrequirements would be approximately US$300 billion per year.7  \n \n                                               \n4 World Bank (2006), Doing Business 2006: Creating Jobs, World Bank Publication, Washington, DC.  \n5 ADB-JBIC-World Bank (2005), Connecting East Asia: A New Framework for Infrastructure, ADB, JBIC and \nWorld Bank Publication, Manila. \n6  See Chatterton, I. and O.

PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS (PPPS) \nGiven the huge infrastructure investment needs of the region and governments\u2019 limited \nresources, the role of the private sector and PPPs in enhancing infrastructure facilities in the \nregion is vital. Since the 1990s, there has been a rapid rise of PPPs around the world. \nGovernments in developing as well as developed countries are using PPP arrangements for \n                                               \n8 These broad estimates of infrastructure investment needs are supported by aggregative analysis of investment \nneeds in the region based on regression equations linking GDP growth to infrastructure investment needs.   \n9 Planning Commission, Government of India, 2007. \n10 Fay Marainne and Tito Yepes (2003), \u201cInvesting in Infrastructure: what is needed from 2000 to 2010,\u201d World \nBank Policy Research Working Paper 3102, July 2003.  \n7 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 80    Geethanjali Nataraj \n \nimproved delivery of infrastructure services. PPPs are becoming the preferred method for \npublic  procurement  of  infrastructure  and  infrastructure  services  projects  throughout  the \nworld. \n3.1. Features of PPPs \nUnder PPPs, the public and private sectors work together on the implementation of projects, \neach retaining their own identities and responsibilities. They collaborate on the basis of a \nclearly defined sharing of tasks and risks to achieve benefits of added value and increased \nefficiency. PPPs are a procurement tool where the contract payments are usually structured \nin  such  a  way  that  the  public  authority  and/or  users  pay  only  for  services  rendered \nsatisfactorily. Project-related risks are largely transferred to the private entity. In a PPP, the \nfocus of the government shifts to policy, strategy, and a monitoring role rather than service \ndelivery. In the long term, the benefits of PPPs are in improved management and use of \nfunds. Accordingly, affordability has to be the cornerstone of the planning process.  \n3.2. Case for Public-Private Partnerships \nPPPs are unlikely to entirely replace traditional infrastructure financing and development any \ntime soon, if ever. PPPs are just one tool among many. Governments typically have a \nnumber of objectives when building infrastructure: getting good value for money, timely \ndelivery, meeting public needs, and so on. The procurement model that best addresses \nthese  objectives  is  the  one  that  is  chosen  based  on  the  circumstances  of  individual \ncases/projects\u2014PPPs have shown their potential as an important way to meet the objectives \nand address infrastructure shortages. For example, PPPs provide new sources of capital for \npublic infrastructure projects. Private equity, pension funds, and other sources of private \nfinancing must still be repaid, but shifting the responsibility for arranging the financing to a \nprivate partner can help deliver infrastructure if a public entity is unwilling or unable to \nshoulder the full debt or the associated risk of the project at a particular point in time. Other \nadvantages of PPPs include: \n \n1.  Bringing construction forward \n \nConventional procurements typically require the public sector to provide significant \ncapital upfront, even though the benefits/results of the project may be delayed or \nuncertain. Most forms of PPPs enable the public sector to spread the public's cost of \ninfrastructure investment over the lifetime of the asset, much as homeowners do \nwhen they take out home mortgages. As a result, infrastructure projects can be \ncompleted much quicker, allowing users to benefit from the investment much sooner \nthan is typical under pay-as-you-go financing.11 In many cases, the private contractor \nalso has a strong incentive to complete the project as quickly as possible because it \nneeds the stream of revenues to repay the capital costs.  \n2.  On-time and on-budget delivery \nWith payments better aligned to the delivery of project objectives, PPPs also have a \nsolid track record of completing construction on time or even ahead of schedule. For \nexample, in 1997, Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) signed an agreement with P & \nO (ports and cargo handling), Australia for the development of a two-berth container \nterminal on a Build Operate and Transfer (BOT) basis for 30 years. P & O completed \n                                               \n11 For  example,  the  creative  financing  approach  used  for  the  Virginia  Pocahontas  Parkway  PPP  project \neliminated what might have been a 15-year delay in construction while financing was assembled. \n8 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 80    Geethanjali Nataraj \n \nthe project ahead of schedule and commenced operations at the new Nhava Sheva \nInternational Container Terminal (NSICT) in 1999.12   \n3.  Shifting construction and maintenance risk to the private sector \n \nPolitics and budget pressures play havoc with the proper maintenance of existing \ninfrastructure. There always seems to be another, higher priority\u2014some program or \ncrisis requires more urgent funding than rehabilitating an aging road or school, a \nbudget deficit may push funding for infrastructure maintenance further down the \npriority list, or an upcoming election may lead politicians to delay funding for updating \na wastewater treatment plant to make way for a more politically appealing program or \nproject.  Moreover,  the  effect  of  reducing  spending  on  maintenance  is  rarely \nimmediate; politicians who opt to cut back on such spending will likely have left office \nlong before society begins to complain about crumbling roadbeds or overburdened \nelectricity networks. \n \nSuch deferred maintenance imposes huge costs in the long run\u2014for example, early \nintervention costs about 20 percent less than maintenance postponed to the last \nquarter of a road's life. Continual deferral of maintenance results in more safety \nproblems over the course of a shorter infrastructure lifespan, reduced quality of \nservices, and generally worse financial outcomes. \n \nWell-designed  PPPs  can  ameliorate  these  problems  by  transferring  certain \nconstruction and maintenance risks to a private partner. Among the risks that may be \nassumed by the private partner are:  \n\u2022  Design risk of infrastructure projects  (e.g., roads, flyovers)  \n\u2022  Meeting required standards of delivery  \n\u2022  Incurring excessive cost overruns during construction  \n\u2022  Completing the facility on time  \n\u2022  Underlying costs to the service delivery operator and the future costs associated \nwith the asset \n\u2022  Industrial action against or physical damage to the asset  \n\u2022  Certain market risks associated with the project  \nThe ability to shift some or all of these risks to the private sector is an important \nbenefit of PPPs. Payment structures require the assets be available and properly \nmaintained over time. The public sector thereby gains greater confidence in the level \nof  its  spending  commitments  over  the  lifetime  of  the  asset.  Greater  cost \ntransparency, in turn, supports more effective planning and helps to avoid cuts in \nother service areas as a result of unexpected infrastructure costs.  \n4.  Cost and Construction Savings \nCost savings from PPPs typically materialize in several forms: lower construction \ncosts, reduced life-cycle maintenance costs, and lower costs of associated risks. \n                                               \n12 In Canada, for example, Terminal 3 at the Toronto Pearson Airport was completed 18 months ahead of \nschedule under a PPP contract. The United Kingdom's National Audit Office reported in 2003 that 73% of non-\nPFI construction projects were over budget and 70% were delivered late. In contrast, only 22% of the PFI \nprojects came in over budget and only 24% were late. \n \n9 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 80    Geethanjali Nataraj \n \nIn traditional contracting, the private sector's role is typically limited to immediate \nconstruction. This can create a perverse incentive to economize on elements of \nconstruction today even though maintenance costs might be higher in the long run. \nShifting long-term operation and maintenance responsibilities to the private sector \ncreates a stronger incentive to ensure long-term construction quality because the firm \nwill be continue to be responsible for maintenance costs years down the road. This \ncreates a strong incentive to do preventive maintenance and reduces the risk of \nfuture fluctuations in operations costs. Under this scenario, the public benefits from \nthe construction\u2019s life-cycle efficiency.13  \n5.  Strong customer service orientation \nPrivate sector infrastructure providers, often relying on user fees from customers for \nrevenue, have a strong incentive to focus on providing superior customer service. \nMoreover, as the asset is no longer managed by the public sector, the public sector \nis able to concentrate more on ensuring the provider maintains certain customer \nservice levels. Also, innovation in customer service delivery helps to account for high \nsatisfaction levels.14 \n6.  Enabling the public sector to focus on outcomes and core business \nWhen they are properly structured, PPPs enable governments to focus on outcomes \ninstead of inputs. When utilizing PPPs, governments are able to focus leadership \nattention on the outcome-based public value they are trying to create. While PPPs \nhold significant benefits as an infrastructure delivery tool, the model is not without its \ncritics. Some of the criticisms are well-grounded and merit careful consideration \nwhen evaluating the relative pros and cons of delivery method alternatives. Others, \nhowever, are driven by a misunderstanding of PPPs or are based on outdated or \nincomplete information. PPPs also present formidable challenges, both at earlier and \nlater stages of market development. Addressing these challenges and maximizing \nthe benefits of PPPs require governments to operate in a new way. \n3.3. Types of PPPs \nPPPs across the world are becoming more and more popular. The past fifteen years have \nseen development in the modality of private involvement. The main defining feature of PPPs \nis the degree of private control over and involvement in financing. \n \nHowever, the important point to note is that there is no unique model of PPP. Each project, \ngiven its circumstances, will define what is suitable and what is required. Additionally, each \nmodel has a different impact on the poor.  \n \nSome of the most common PPP models are:  \n \n1.  Design-Build (DB) \nUnder this model, the government contracts with a private partner to design and build \na  facility  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  set  by  the  government.  After \ncompleting  the  facility,  the  government  assumes  responsibility  for  operating  and \nmaintaining the facility. This method of procurement is also sometimes referred to as \nBuild-Transfer (BT).  \n                                               \n13 A  United  Kingdom  study  of  benefits  flowing  from  operating  PFI  projects  found  that,  on  average,  the \ngovernment expects to achieve a savings of 17% over the whole-life cost of services by using the PPP \napproach, with savings as high as 45% in one of the cases.  \n14 In the United States, the owners of the 91 Express Lanes freeway in Southern California hold focus groups to \nlearn more about how to please customers. \n10 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 80    Geethanjali Nataraj \n \n \n2.  Design-Build-Maintain (DBM) \nThis model is similar to DB except that the private sector also maintains the facility. \nThe public sector retains the responsibility for operations. \n \n3.  Design-Build-Operate (DBO) \nUnder this model, the private sector designs and builds a facility. Once the facility is \ncompleted, the title for the new facility is transferred to the public sector, while the \nprivate sector operates the facility for a specified period. This procurement model is \nalso referred to as Build-Transfer-Operate (BTO). \n \n4.  Design-Build-Operate-Maintain (DBOM) \nThis  model  combines  the  responsibilities  of  design-build  procurements  with  the \noperations and maintenance of a facility for a specified period by a private sector \npartner. At the end of that period, the operation of the facility is transferred back to \nthe public sector. This method of procurement is also referred to as Build-Operate-\nTransfer. (BOT) \n \n5.  Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) \nThe government grants a franchise to a private partner to finance, design, build, and \noperate a facility for a specific period of time. Ownership of the facility is transferred \nback to the public sector at the end of that period.  \n6.  Build-Own-Operate (BOO) \nThe government grants the right to finance, design, build, operate, and maintain a \nproject to a private entity, which retains ownership of the project. The private entity is \nnot required to transfer the facility back to the government.  \n7.  Design-Build-Finance-Operate/Maintain (DBFO, DBFM, or DBFO/M) \nUnder this model, the private sector designs, builds, finances, operates, and/or \nmaintains a new facility under a long-term lease. At the end of the lease term, the \nfacility is transferred to the public sector. In some countries, DBFO/M covers both \nBOO and BOOT. \nPPPs can also be used for existing services and facilities in addition to new ones. Some of \nthese models are: \n1.  Service contract \nThe government contracts with a private entity to provide services the government \npreviously performed.  \n2.  Management contract \nA management contract differs from a service contract in that the private entity is \nresponsible for all aspects of operations and maintenance of the facility under \ncontract.  \n3.  Lease \nThe government grants a private entity a leasehold interest in an asset. The private \npartner operates and maintains the asset in accordance with the terms of the lease.  \n4.  Concession \nThe government grants a private entity exclusive rights to provide, operate, and \nmaintain an asset over a long period of time in accordance with performance \nrequirements set forth by the government. The public sector retains ownership of the \n11 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 80    Geethanjali Nataraj \n \noriginal asset, while the private operator retains ownership over any improvements \nmade during the concession period.  \n5.  Divestiture (either complete or partial) \nThe government transfers an asset, either in part or in full, to the private sector. \nGenerally the government will include certain conditions with the sale of the asset to \nensure that improvements are made and citizens continue to be served. \n \nThere is no unique model when it comes to private sector\u2019s involvement in infrastructure. \nEach project, given its circumstances, will define what is suitable and what is required. Each \nmodel has a different impact on the poor. However, Greenfield project type PPPs are very \npopular as they help to create employment and it is easier to set up a new plant and get \napprovals rather than expand operations or re-build something on an existing structure or \ncompany.  \n4. INFRASTRUCTURE AND PRIVATE PARTICIPATION IN ASIA AND DEVELOPING \nECONOMIES \nTraditionally, infrastructure investment in Asia and across the world has been funded largely \nby  the  public  sector  and  various  multilateral  agencies  including  World  Bank,  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and organizations like JBIC. Fiscal space and lack of resources \nhas limited governments\u2019 capacity to finance large scale infrastructure projects. Recently, \nhowever, the private sector has entered the picture to support government in addition to its \nown business needs to help finance and build large-scale infrastructure projects in Asia and \nthe  developing  world.  The  private  sector  participated  with  zeal  in  the  early  Nineties  in \ninfrastructure development and finance. However, private participation in infrastructure proj-\nects in developing countries plummeted after the 1997 Asian crisis and followed a broadly \ndeclining trend for several years afterward. However, in 2004 and 2005 investment in such \nprojects increased sharply. In the meantime, the distribution of investment across sectors \nand regions and the allocation of risks between public and private parties shifted. Private \nsponsors started putting more emphasis on risk mitigation strategies. To take advantage of \nprivate sponsors\u2019 renewed interest in infrastructure projects, governments need to create \nrisk-sharing arrangements that attract private operators while also benefiting governments, \ntaxpayers, and users (Kerf and Izagurre, 2007).  \n \nFurthermore, total investment commitments to private infrastructure projects in developing \ncountries grew by 70% in 2004\u20132005, to reach US$95 billion. As a share of developing \ncountry GDP, investment increased from 0.7% in 2003 to 1% in 2005. In nominal terms, \ninvestment levels in 2005 were close to their 1997 peak. Yet in real terms they were still \nabout 30% lower (Figure 1), and as a share of GDP they were almost 50% below the peak. \nBut it was the first time since 1997 that investment rose two years in a row and, by any \nmeasure, that growth was substantial.  \n \n12 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 80    Geethanjali Nataraj \n \nFigure 1: Investment Commitments to Infrastructure Projects with Private \nParticipation in Developing Countries by Sector, 1990\u20132005 \n \n \nSources: World Bank and PPIAF, PPI Project database. \n \nThe growth was driven mainly by one sector: telecommunications. Indeed, that sector has \ndominated investment since 1998, and its share in 2001\u20132005 was substantially larger than \nin the 1990s. In 2005, telecommunications claimed 63% of the total growth; at US$60 billion, \ninvestment  in  the  sector  was  just  3%  below  its  1998  peak.  With  telecommunications \nexcluded, investment still rose in both 2004 and 2005, though more modestly\u2014at US$35 \nbillion in 2005, investment in the other sectors was a full 60% below its peak. Overall, Figure \n1  also  shows  that  investments  in  infrastructure  projects  with  private  participation  in \ndeveloping countries reached its peak in 1997 and suddenly plummeted thereafter due to \nthe East Asian crisis. It is only in 2000 that investments picked up again though the peak of \n1997 has not been reached again. \n \nRegions ranked by investment, 1990\u20132005 \n \nUnlike across industry sectors, the distribution of investment across developing regions \nbecame increasingly balanced. From 1990\u20132000, Latin America by far had the largest share \nof investment, with almost 50% of the global total. East Asia followed with 27%. Each of the \nother regions accounted for only a small share. By contrast, in 2001\u20132005, investment was \nmuch more equally distributed. Latin America remained in the lead, but with only a 31% \nshare. Eastern Europe and Central Asia followed with 27%, East Asia with 18%, and the \nSouth Asia region had a share of 7.3%. Further, energy continued to be the top sector for \nprivate  participation  in  infrastructure  with  1,307  projects  from  1990\u20132005  followed  by \ntransport (829), telecommunications (749), and water and sewerage (383) (Tables 6 and 7). \nThe data by top 10 countries on private projects shows that the PRC had 483 projects, \ndominating  East  Asia,  followed  by  Brazil  (297)  in  Latin  America  and  India  having  the \nmaximum number of projects in South Asia (172) (Table 8).  \n \n13 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 80    Geethanjali Nataraj \n \nTable 6: Project Investment Ranked by Region, 1990\u20132005 (in US$ million) \n \nRegion  Project Investment \nLatin America and the Caribbean  407,202\nEast Asia and Pacific  224,194\nEurope and Central Asia  182,449\nSouth Asia  70,435\nMiddle East and North Africa  41,163\nSub-Saharan Africa  36,510\nSource: Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF), World Bank. \n \n \nTable 7: Primary Sectors Ranked by Number of Projects in the World, 1990\u20132005 \n \nSector  Project Count \nEnergy  1,307 \nTransport  829 \nTelecommunications  749 \nWater and sewerage  383 \nSource: PPIAF, World Bank. \n \n \nTable 8: Top 10 Countries by Projects, 1990\u20132005 \n \nCountry  Project Count \nPRC  483 \nBrazil  297 \nRussian Federation  284 \nArgentina  182 \nIndia  172 \nMexico  151 \nChile  103 \nColombia  90 \nMalaysia  87 \nThailand  84 \nSource: PPIAF, World Bank. \n \nRecent private activity has also become somewhat less concentrated by country.

Therefore, the following \nsection  attempts  to  not  only  highlight  the  role  of  the  private  sector  in  infrastructure \ninvestment in South Asia but also to underscore the constraints to private participation in \ninfrastructure construction in the South Asian region.  \n4.1. Infrastructure with Private Participation in South Asia  \nToday, the private sector is the engine of growth for many countries and expansion of the \nprivate sector has become a central theme in the development agenda of many of those \ncountries. Sustained economic growth is critical for job creation and poverty reduction. In \naddition,  a  thriving,  private-sector  led  economy  is  probably  the  best  defense  against \ncorruption, as economies with broad private sector participation, active competition, and \nclear rules have less scope for corruption. The private sector also has much to contribute to \nother government goals, by way of tax revenues, reaching out to local communities, setting \ninternational standards, and working with governments to extend infrastructure access.  \nSouth Asia has relatively low levels of private participation in infrastructure. From 1990\u2013\n2005, the region\u2019s 255 projects attracted about US$67 billion in investment commitments, far \nshort of commitments made in leading regions of East Asia (Table 10).

Major findings with respect to PPPs in South, East and South East Asia \nPrivate sector investment in infrastructure also showed a wide variation across countries and \nsub-regions, largely reflecting differences in policy development, institutional environments, \nincome  levels,  and  approaches  of  governments.  South  East  Asia  started  attracting \nsignificant private investment in infrastructure early and captured the lion\u2019s share of it (about \nUS$136.6 billion), accounting for almost half the region\u2019s total between 1984 and 2005. East \nAsia and South Asia were the next two sub-regions to attract significant private sector \ninvestment,  each  accounting  for  about  a  quarter  of  total  investment.  Private  sector \ninvestment in infrastructure flowing to central Asia and the Pacific was low or negligible. \nPrivate sector investment in infrastructure is highly concentrated in some countries. The top \nsix  countries\u2014the  PRC  (25.3%),  India  (17.0%),  Malaysia  (15.5%),  Philippines  (10.9%), \nThailand (10.5%), and Indonesia (8.8%)\u2014account for almost 90% of the total during 1984\u2013\n2005. Country level time-series data indicate that private sector investment in infrastructure \nhas not recovered to pre-crisis levels in several South East Asian economies including \nIndonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand. In contrast, private sector investment in \ninvestment in the PRC and India was generally unaffected by the East Asian Crisis. In fact, \nmuch of the private sector investment in infrastructure in India took place after the crisis and \nhas increased in recent years. Lack of private sector investment in infrastructure reflects the \nlag in reform in India compared to East Asia and South East Asia and confirms that private \nsector investment has come back. \n \nEnergy (39.6%), telecommunications (35.9%), and transport (18.8%) accounted for most of \nthe private sector investment in infrastructure in the South Asia region during 1984\u20132005, \nwith very little going to water and sewerage. The levels of investment largely reflect basic \nsector characteristics (e.g., technology, competition, cost recovery, and legal and regulatory \nrequirements) or the level of sector reforms that (1) affect private sector participation; and, \n(2) suggest lower scope for private sector investments in water supply, sanitation, and waste \nmanagement than in the other sectors. Greenfield projects accounted for more than two-\nthirds of the total, attracting most of the private sector investment in infrastructure in the \nregion and comprised the greatest number of investments in all sub-regions except central \nAsia. Divestiture was the next largest form of investment in the region, including Central \nAsia, East Asia, and South Asia. The flow of private sector investment under concession \narrangements in the region has been small except in South East Asia and the Pacific. \n21 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 80    Geethanjali Nataraj \n \nManagement and lease contracts accounted for a negligible part of such fund flows (ADB, \n2007).16 \n \nIndia\u2019s development is also severely constrained by weak infrastructure. Five years ago \nIndia invested US$18 billion in its power and transport infrastructure, about 6% of GDP. The \nPRC invested US$128 billion the same year, or about 20% of GDP. Highways, which move \nabout 70% of goods in India, account for only 2% of the country\u2019s 3.32 million kilometers of \nroad. It takes an average of 85 hours to unload and reload a ship at India\u2019s major ports, 10 \ntimes longer than in Hong Kong, China or Singapore, according to government figures. The \nIndian government estimates that US$320 billion needs to be invested in its infrastructure if \ncurrent economic growth is to be sustained.  \n \nThe challenge facing infrastructure in South Asia is securing funding at competitive rates. \nFor example, of the US$4.3 billion capital investment required to upgrade India\u2019s railway \nnetwork, just one quarter will come from government. The remainder has to come from the \nprivate sector. One of the easier ways to boost infrastructure development and spending is \nto simplify India\u2019s burdensome regulatory environment. Despite economic reforms in the \n1990s, India has some of the of the world\u2019s most restrictive labor laws, which serve to \ndiscourage corporate growth and new employment. For example, companies with more than \n100 employees require government permission to dismiss workers. The easy movement of \nhuman capital both around the country and within industry sectors to meet demand is critical \nif India is to capitalize on its young, educated workforce and expand the economy.  \n5. ROLE OF MULTILATERAL INSTITUTIONS IN SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE \nDEVELOPMENT IN THE REGION AND ALTERNATE FORMS OF FINANCING \nINFRASTRUCTURE \nThe role of multilateral institutions in financing and supporting infrastructure activities in the \ndeveloping world is extremely important. The contribution of multilateral agencies like World \nBank,  ADB,  African  Development  Bank,  Inter-American  Development  Bank,  and  the \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development in infrastructure development and its \nsubsequent  enhancement  of  economic  growth  and  alleviating  poverty  is  significant. \nHowever, given the growing demand for infrastructure in Asia\u2014more specifically in South \nAsia\u2014multilateral  agencies  are  expected  to  play  an  even  greater  role  in  bridging  the \ninfrastructure deficit and sustaining economic growth in the region.  \n5.1. World Bank\u2019s Role in Infrastructure Development in South Asia \nThe World Bank has funded numerous projects to develop infrastructure around the world. \nRecognizing that it must play a key role in meeting global needs for infrastructure-related \nfinancing and policy advice, the World Bank has placed infrastructure at the front and center \nof its development agenda to reduce poverty and stimulate economic growth. The World \nBank has developed an Infrastructure Action Plan, which encompasses innovative ways to \nfinance infrastructure projects. \nIn  the  1990s,  the  World  Bank  reduced  investment  lending  for  infrastructure  with  the \nexpectation  that  private  sector  investment  in  infrastructure  would  rise.  However,  the \nanticipated rise in private lending never came. Private financing for infrastructure plummeted \nfrom US$128 billion in 1997 to US$58 billion in 2002, quite contrary to the expected increase. \nBank investment lending for infrastructure dropped from US$9.5 billion in 1993 to US$5.5 \nbillion in 2002. However, since then, the World Bank has stepped up its infrastructure \n                                               \n16 Sharen Diwesh, Bindu N.

In part, this was due to some disastrous environmental and social \nconsequences  of  dam  construction  and  other  large  infrastructure,  while  the  failure  of \nprivatization in Latin America contributed to the toppling of governments. As a result, the \nWorld  Bank  became  a  debt  collection  agency\u2014collecting  US$5.2  billion  more  than  it \nextended in loans. Beginning in 2003, the institution began infrastructure lending on a major \nscale; soon this type of lending will represent 40% of the institution\u2019s total business.  \nIn South Asia, the World Bank has played a major role in funding infrastructure in the region. \nThe World Bank approved nearly US$3.8 billion for South Asia in 2006. Out of this, US$3 \nbillion was for India alone. US$1.2 billion in loans from International Bank for Reconstruction \nand Development (IBRD) and US$2.6 billion in International Development Agency (IDA) \ncommitments, of which US$275 were grants. This assistance from the World Bank seeks to \naddress  the  regions  vast  urban  and  rural  infrastructure  deficit  and  weakness  in  the \ninvestment climate, including corruption and red tape.  \nAs the World Bank continues its efforts in infrastructure service delivery, it will also endeavor \nto ensure that high quality in infrastructure projects is maintained and continually draw on \nlessons learned from the past to keep improving performance. An integral part of this effort \nwill be to improve the measurement of results and infrastructure impact\u2014especially the \nimpact on the poor. The World Bank\u2019s infrastructure business, in partnership with other \nmultilateral and bilateral organizations, is committed to developing a \u201cresults measurement\u201d \nagenda,  to  ensure  accurate  and  transparent  measures  of  performance,  to  increase \naccountability, and to improve the quality and sustainability of development impact.  \n5.2. Asian Development Bank \nADB offers a variety of direct assistance to the private sector. Specifically, ADB's role is to \nassist private enterprises to undertake financially viable projects with significant economic \nand social merit and thereby achieve positive development impact. Through its involvement \nin these projects, ADB helps to facilitate more private projects, thus promoting the efficient \nuse  of  resources,  accelerating  economic  development,  reducing  poverty,  and  raising \nstandards of business. \nIn addition, ADB assists the private sector by mobilizing capital. The demand for private \ncapital has increased considerably in the region, influenced by the financing needs of large \ninfrastructure  development  programs  as  well  as  the  capitalization  needs  of  financial \ninstitutions. While official development aid continues to be an important element in the \ndevelopment strategies of ADB and its developing member countries (DMCs), the aid is \ninadequate to meet the DMCs\u2019 growing capital requirements. Attracting private capital has \nbecome a strategic objective of many DMC governments and ADB is in a unique position to \nassist in mobilizing international private capital for its DMCs. ADB has considerable regional \nexperience  accumulated  over  decades  and,  through  policy  dialogue  with  member \ngovernments, has assisted in formulating policies designed to encourage private initiatives.  \nFurthermore, direct participation of ADB in private sector activities acts as an additional \nattraction  to  long-term,  private  investors.  Hence,  the  presence  of  a  multilateral  bank \ninvesting alongside private partners helps to provide a sense of security to the private \ninvestors. Innovative financial solutions involving a mixture of private and official funding \nsources may be needed to entice commercial lenders and equity investors to manage the \nrisks associated with investing in developing countries. \n23 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 80    Geethanjali Nataraj \n \nADB directly supports private enterprises, private equity funds, and financial institutions. Its \ntraditional modes of financing are equity investments and hard currency loans. Equity may \ninclude preferred stocks, convertible loans, and other forms of mezzanine financing. ADB \nhas  three  credit  enhancement  products  to  facilitate  such  co-financing:  Complementary \nFinancing Scheme, Partial Credit Guarantee, and Political Risk Guarantee.  \nADB private sector operations focus primarily in two sectors: finance and infrastructure. The \nfinancial sector, or capital markets projects, assists private financial intermediaries in diverse \nsectors including banking, leasing, venture capital financing, merchant banking, micro-credit, \nsmall  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs),  private  equity  funds,  mutual  funds,  insurance, \nsecuritization,  credit  enhancement,  and  credit  rating.  Infrastructure  includes \ntelecommunications, power and energy, water supply and sanitation, ports, airports, and toll \nroads. The projects may involve various forms of risk-sharing and ownership arrangements \nincluding BOO and BOT structures. Some examples where ADB participated include the \nBOO  venture  for  Fauji  Oil  Terminal  in  Port  Qasim  and  the  North  Luzon  Expressway \nRehabilitation and Expansion Project in the Philippines.17  \nADB assists in analyzing feasibility studies and developing the structure of infrastructure \nprojects and provides financial support to qualified projects through equity investments, \nloans, and credit enhancement products, including guarantees. ADB is an active member of \nthe Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF), a multi-donor facility, and also \nprovides assistance to governments to promote private sector involvement in infrastructure \nbuilding to help eliminate poverty and achieve sustainable development.  \nWhen appraising projects, ADB pays particular attention to the process of selecting the \ndevelopers  and  suppliers  as  well  as  to  a  project\u2019s  environmental  and  social  benefits, \nparticularly poverty reduction. A fair and transparent competitive bidding process is typically \nthe best way to ensure that the terms of the project are reasonable for all the stakeholders. \nTo be eligible for ADB assistance, the proposed investment should be in the private sector of \na DMC and owned by private sector entities, which may be local or foreign. An enterprise \nowned jointly by private and government interests may be eligible for ADB assistance, \nprovided the majority of its equity is privately owned and the project is controlled by private \ninvestors. \nADB's total financial support for a project, including loan, equity investment, partial credit \nguarantee, and underwriting commitment, is limited by policy to 25% of the total cost of the \nproject or US$50 million, whichever is lower. ADB also provides political risk guarantee \ncoverage without the host government's counter-guarantee, of up to 50% of the total project \ncost or US$100 million, whichever is less. ADB participation is intended to catalyze financing \nfrom local and/or foreign sources, not to compete with these sources. ADB's policy is to limit \nequity investments to less than 25% of the total share capital. Also, ADB cannot be the \nlargest single investor in an enterprise. If needed, ADB may assist in mobilizing additional \ndebt from commercial banks and other financial institutions. This may be through parallel \nfinancing separate from the ADB package, or through co-financing, in which ADB acts as \nlender of record. \nUltimately, ADB's role in financing infrastructure projects is primarily to catalyze and mobilize \nresources into private sector projects which deliver development impact, and to \"add value\" \nto private sector projects to sustain development impact. Table 19 depicts infrastructure \nlending by ADB in the Asian region.  \n                                               \n17 More examples of ADB projects are illustrated in the ADB booklet entitled, \"Private Sector Operations,\" \navailable on the ADB Website. \n24 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 80    Geethanjali Nataraj \n \nTable 19: Infrastructure lending by ADB \n \n  Public Sector (in US$ billion)  Private sector (in US$ million) \n1970s  1980s  1990s  2000\u201306  1980s  1990s  2000\u201306 \nLending  3.6  11.4  26.6  20.7  35.1  497.4  1283.6 \nShare in total lending  54  53  50  53  10.8  37.6  52.1 \n(in percentage) \nSource: R. Nangia (2007). \n \nIt is evident that ADB lending to infrastructure both in the private and public sector has been \ninstrumental  in  developing  infrastructure  in  the  Asian  region.  However,  given  the  huge \ninfrastructure  needs  of  the  Asian  region,  especially  the  South,  several  novel,  alternate \nmeans of financing infrastructure, such as defense offsets, have been highlighted in the \nliterature in recent years.  \n5.3. Defense Offsets (An Alternate Means of Financing Infrastructure) \nThe importance of offsets in the global defense trade has been growing over the last two \ndecades.  Today  most  developed  and  developing  nations  have  some  sort  of  offset \nprogramme, frequently either to protect their own defense industries, or to assist in the \nfurther  development  and  enhancement  of  burgeoning  indigenous  defense  industrial \ncapabilities. In the modern defense business industry, offset has become an essential part of \nany proposed defense equipment package, with many nations increasingly paying greater \nattention to the offset proposals contained within the supplier\u2019s proposal packages.  \n \nFrequently, offset packages are the determining factor in the decision-taking process as far \nas to whom contracts are awarded. It is known that, in some countries, it is the details of the \noffset packages put forward by competing contractors which is looked at and assessed first, \neven before other parts of the tender are examined.  \n \nThe US Department of Commerce, Fifth Annual Report on Offsets in Defense Trade (2001) \nstates that, \u201cSome governments readily admit that they are no longer concerned with the \nprice or quality of the defense system purchased, but rather with the scope of the offset \npackage offered. Recently, the Czech Republic announced that in competition for its jet \nfighter  procurement,  offsets  would  be  the  deciding  factor  as  opposed  to  technical  and \nperformance criteria and price.\u201d \n   \nOffsets in defense trade can be both direct and indirect. Some of the examples of direct and \nindirect offsets are as follows: \n \n\u2022  Direct \nTechnology  transfer,  co-production,  local  installation,  local  assembly \n(components;  platforms),  parts  manufacture,  creation  of  authorized  regional \nservice centers, purchase of defense components from the customer country. \n \n\u2022  Indirect \nIndustrial projects, employment creation, skills transfer, student sponsorships, \nbuilding  of  schools  and  colleges,  infrastructure  development,  investment \npromotion,  export  development,  management  skills  (IT;  packaging;  quality \nstandards; marketing).  \n \nThe importance of offsets for developing economies, like India\u2019s, is immense. Currently, \nmore than 120 developed and developing countries have some sort of economic offset for \npurchase of aircraft\u2019s and defense technology. Offsets account for between 10\u201315% of world \ntrade  and  now  applies  to  major  civil  programs  such  as  commercial  aircraft, \n25 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 80    Geethanjali Nataraj \n \ntelecommunications, and power generation. It is a buyer\u2019s market and India, with its huge \nimport of defense-related equipment and capital goods, must leverage from its defense \ndeals.  However,  in  comparison  to  its  other  developing  counterparts  like  Brazil  and  the \nPhilippines, India has not leveraged much from its offset arrangements and, in fact, does not \nappear to have a formal offset policy in place. Though in the past India has struck a few \noffset deals involving technology transfer to build the domestic defense industry, counter \ntrade, and long term credit arrangements, it certainly has not capitalized on its defense deals \nas much as it could or should have. A long term offset policy will go a long way in meeting \nthe country\u2019s investment needs, especially in sectors like infrastructure. \n \nAccording to the India Infrastructure Report (2006),18 currently 5.5% of GDP is invested in \nthe infrastructure sector. This needs to be increased to 8% in the fiscal year 2007\u20132008, by \nwhich time the annual level of investment in infrastructural facilities is projected to treble or \nmore, from the current level of US$60 billion, to US$130 billion by the end 2007. And given \nthe  infrastructure  requirements  of  nearly  US$150  billion  over  the  next  5  years  and  an \nincrease in India\u2019s capital goods imports in the coming years, having an offset policy and \nleveraging big deals in the defense sector is an important policy option which the country \nmust optimize.   \n \nIn the literature, a new word to describe offsets is \u201cEconomic Enhancement\u201d (EE). The \nultimate objective of EE is to leverage a government\u2019s buying power to provide the maximum \nbenefit to a country\u2019s economy. Some of the major benefits of an offset policy include: \n \n1.  Aid in economic diversification and realizing goals set within the national economic \ndevelopment plan. \n2.  Reduce the cost of major government procurements to the economy. \n3.  Provide diversification of the economic base. \n4.  Encourage FDI. \n5.  Import substitution. \n6.  Create export markets for goods produced locally. \n7.  New employment opportunities for local nationals. \n8.  Technology transfer. \n \nAs mentioned earlier, nearly 130 countries have an offset policy in place. The use of offsets \nin non-defense-related areas is on the rise. It is believed that India\u2019s requirement of defense \ngoods is assessed to be around Rs. 200 billion yearly. Of this, imports alone constitute Rs. \n100 billion a year. Thus, India being a major arms importer, offsets could be a good route to \nprocure  much  needed  infrastructure  investment  and  reap  other  benefits  of  technology \ntransfer,  employment  generation,  and,  above  all,  make  the  Indian  defense  sector \ninternationally competitive and self-reliant.  \n6. THE INDIAN EXPERIENCE WITH PPPS: GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES \nKey  government  initiatives.19 The  Indian  Department  of  Economic  Affairs  (DEA)  has \nhighlighted that the Government of India (GOI) is committed to raising the investment in \ninfrastructure from its existing level of 4.7% of GDP to around 8%. Infrastructure shortages \nare proving a key constraint in sustaining and expanding India\u2019s economic growth and \nmaking it more inclusive for the poor. The government is actively promoting PPPs in the key \ninfrastructure  sectors  of  transport  (including  railways),  power,  urban  infrastructure,  and \ntourism. PPPs are seen as an important tool for producing an accelerated and larger pipeline \n                                               \n18  India Infrastructure Report (2006), 3I network, Oxford University Press, New Delhi, India. \n19 The section on initiatives by the Government of India is largely taken from the ADB\u2019s regional workshop on \nPPP\u2019s held in December 2006 in India for the Chief Secretaries of Indian states. \n26 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 80    Geethanjali Nataraj \n \nof  infrastructure  investments,  and  reducing  the  country\u2019s  infrastructure  deficit.  A  PPP \ndepartment has been established in the DEA to administer various proposals and coordinate \nactivities to promote PPPs. \n \nViability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme. The GOI has established the VGF scheme as a \nspecial facility to support the financial viability of those infrastructure projects which are \neconomically  justifiable  but  not  commercially  viable  in  the  immediate  future.  It  involves \nupfront grant assistance of up to 20% of the project cost for state or central level PPP \nprojects  that  are  implemented  by  a  private  sector  developer  who  is  selected  through \ncompetitive bidding. An Empowered Committee has been set up for quick processing of \ncases.  \n \nFacilitating Public-Private Partnership. GOI has established India Infrastructure Finance \nCompany Limited (IIFCL) as a wholly government-owned company to provide long-term \nfinance to infrastructure projects, either directly or through refinancing. The IIFCL caters to \nthe growing financing gap in long-term financing of infrastructure projects in the public, \nprivate, and PPP sectors. Any government project awarded to a private sector company for \ndevelopment, financing, and construction through PPP will have overriding priority under the \nscheme. GOI is working on a number of initiatives to assist and encourage capacity-building \nat  the  state  and  central  levels.  It  is  identifying  the  capacity-building  needs  of  state \ngovernments and providing assistance for the creation of state-level PPP cells such as a \nnodal  agency,  streamlining  the  PPP  approval  process,  developing  PPP  toolkits,  model \nconcession agreements (MCAs), bidding documents, and project preparation manuals. GOI \nis also building a central database and website on PPPs to disseminate updated information \nto the states and the private sector. Arrangements are being finalized under which, state \ngovernments would be able to avail themselves of consultancy support for developing PPP \nprojects.  Institutions  like  the  ADB  have  begun  supporting  the  capacity-building  process \nthrough these workshops and proposed technical assistance projects. \n \nStatus of PPPs and States\u2019 perspectives. Eighty-six PPPs have been awarded in India so \nfar, totaling about Rs 340 billion, in twelve states and three central agencies. Roads and port \nsectors have dominated in the number and size of PPPs. As of October 2006, twelve \nproposals were given in-principle approval under VGF. State governments have identified a \nwhole  range  of  sectors  for  PPPs,  including  roads  and  highways,  ports  (air,  sea,  and \ncontainer), telecommunication, water supply, waste management, tourism, power, industrial \ninfrastructure,  township  development,  leisure,  and  health.  States  have  also  identified \npotential PPP projects that could be developed over the next few years. Many of the projects \nare already in the bidding stage using both memorandum of understanding (MOU) and \ncompetitive bidding procedures. Not many of these projects would require VGF funding. No \nclear  link  between  institutional  structure  and  success  of a  PPP  has  become  apparent. \nState/Union Territory (UT) governments have indicated marked differences in the process of \nPPP development, including variations in existence of infrastructure legislation and policies, \ninstitutional arrangements for identifying and approving PPPs, project development funds \nand companies, financial structuring, and procurement procedures. \n \nRequirements of Central Assistance. The states highlighted a number of areas where \nguidance,  assistance,  and  technical  support  are  required  from  GOI.  These  areas  are: \nVGF(viability gap funding); quicker approval procedures; relaxation of the project details \ncurrently required for an in-principle approval; inclusion of projects awarded through the \nSpecial Purpose Vehicle (SPV) route and not competitive bidding, like railways; inclusion of \nrural sector projects and unfinished projects; inclusion of land costs under VGF financing, \ncapacity-building, setting up PPP cells at the state level; access to project development \nresources; advisory  support  on  infrastructure  legislation  and  regulatory  frameworks  and \ndetailed PPP policies; model PPP execution cycle; contract monitoring and time scheduling; \nguidelines on public sector comparator (PSC) and its comparison with the private sector \n27 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 80    Geethanjali Nataraj \n \npredictor; information on potential sources of long-term debt; and formalization of state PPP \nplans.  The  states  have  also  called  for  streamlining  of  the  statutory  clearances  on \nenvironment, defense, airport authority, land acquisition, etc. \n \nPrivate  Sector  Perspectives.  The  private  sector  recognizes  the  enormous  business \nopportunity of PPPs in India and has welcomed the Government of India\u2019s PPP initiatives. \nThe  private  sector  has  urged  the  government  to  publicize  the  size  of  the  business \nopportunity for PPPs in India to the private sector, which is estimated to be much more than \nhas been previously thought. Given the enormous investment requirements in infrastructure \ndevelopment, the need for a sustainable pipeline of PPP projects has become paramount. \nThe private sector remains eager to see more substantive reforms, enabling changes by \ngovernment in the policy, regulatory provisions, and procurement procedures for PPPs. \n \nImprovements in India\u2019s enabling environment. The private sector has called for changes \nin  India\u2019s  enabling  environment  and  suggested  measures  to  foster  efficiency  and \ntransparency in the bidding process, ensure sanctity of contracts, encourage competition, \npromote market-driven tariffs, and separate regulatory and adjudication authorities. It has \ncalled  for  developing  appropriate  legislative  framework  for  PPPs,  clarification  of  entry \nconditions, suitable contractual structures, and clarification of incentives and concessions. \n \nStandardized  procurement  procedures.  Given  the  variations  in  the  formats,  bidding \nprocedures, agreements, and overall execution of PPPs among the various states and \nagencies, the private sector has highlighted the need for standardized prequalification and \nbidding  procedures  and  guidelines  for  ensuring  efficiency,  predictability,  and  ease  of \napproval process. \n \nTransparency. The need for maintaining transparency in the entire PPP project cycle and \nstakeholder interactions has been noted as a key factor in determining the success of PPPs. \nThe private sector has urged the central and state governments and other public sector \nproject sponsors to be cautious of the \u201cselection by nomination\u201d20 procedure, which is not the \nsame as transparently awarded PPP contracts. \n \nProject  development  and  structuring  facility.  A  major  impediment  to  successful \ncommercialization  of  projects  in  India  has  been  the  absence  of  rigorous  project \ndevelopment. Many of the projects put out for bidding by GOI have been inadequately \nstructured and unsuitable for a PPP. A project development facility (PDF) that provides \nproject sponsors, the resources to procure consultancy, and expert services for conducting \npre-feasibility studies and assessments is required. \n \nPublic sector capacity to successfully execute PPPs. The private sector has highlighted \nits concerns about the absence of a robust pipeline of bankable PPP projects. This is \nattributed  to  insufficient  capacity  of  the  PPP-sponsoring  public  entities  to  identify  and \nimplement deals and execute PPPs. Capacity deficit is seen as the crucial bottleneck in \nachieving a steady flow of successfully negotiated PPP deals. \n \nPublic  sector  reforms,  with  or  without  PPPs.  The  infrastructure  sector  suffers  from \nsupply-side constraints. The PPP experience in various states has shown that procedures \nand processes have been extremely dilatory. The infrastructure sector needs to urgently \nimplement public sector reforms to address supply-side constraints. Changes in delivery \nmechanisms, processes, procedures, and institutional structures need to be tailored towards \nclient-focused outcomes and results. Land acquisition and environmental clearances are \nbest obtained by governments. Social and environmental clearances are also best obtained \n                                               \n20 In selection by nomination an expert panel or committee that is set up directly awards the contract to a \nperson/party and the process is not transparent.  \n28 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 80    Geethanjali Nataraj \n \nby government and not by the private partner. Several projects have stalled with huge time \nand cost overruns due to delays in land acquisition and transfer of land possession to the \nprivate sector. The private sector could deliver much faster if these clearances were handled \nby the project sponsor. Building in environmental and social dimensions of PPPs needs to \nbe made part of the project development cycle. \n \nGenuine and mutually rewarding partnerships. PPPs represent partnerships in action \nwith  huge  stakes  for  both  the  public  sector  and  private  sector  agencies  to  succeed \ncollectively. It is important that the public and private sector work together, keeping the \nproject and outcomes in focus rather than maximizing their own interests, and collaborating \nfor mutually enduring value. PPPs are a new way of doing business and are not about \ncommand and control. Ultimately, the project partners need to remember that PPPs are not \nabout finance, but about improving the quality and efficiency of public services. \n6.1. Public-private Partnerships in Pakistan and Sri Lanka \nThe concept of PPPs in other countries of South Asia, such as Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri \nLanka, and Nepal, is not as well established as it is in India. Though many PPP projects in \ninfrastructure have been implemented in these countries, the total number of projects and \ntotal investment in these projects has been negligible. In Pakistan, PPPs were non-existent \nup until the last two or three years. A few instances of BOT-type PPPs have been found in \ntelecommunication, power generation, and the setting up of an oil terminal at Karachi port by \nthe private sector. No projects have emerged for private participation in water supply and \nsanitation although there have been attempts to have private sector involvement in solid \nwaste  management.  The  overall  lack  of  investment  in  infrastructure  through  PPPs  in \nPakistan  is  attributable  to  the  government\u2019s  lack  of  experience  and  capacity  in \ncommissioning and executing PPPs in infrastructure. There is also a lack of resources and \npackaging projects that could be successfully offered for financing.   \n \nIn contrast to Pakistan, the experience of Sri Lanka with PPPs has been fairly good. Sri \nLanka in recent years has been spending 3.5% of GDP on infrastructure development. The \ngovernment of Sri Lanka set up the Bureau of Infrastructure Investment with enough funds \nfor  private  investors  to  borrow.  Success  stories  include  the  Colombo  port,  Sri  Lankan \nAirlines, and telecommunications projects. However, these were not BOT or BOO, though \nthey did involve PPP via divestiture of shares below 50% to the private sector. Sri Lanka has \ntaken the help of the Indian government and emulated in its own country the success of the \nNational Highway PPP project in India. The problem in Sri Lanka is not the lack of private \nfinances for infrastructure projects but managing the transition for private sector involvement.  \n6.2. Global lessons for India \nThough PPPs are a relatively new approach to procurement, lessons may be drawn from the \nexperiences of developed and developing countries on the conditions for successful PPPs. \nAs a relatively late entrant into the PPP development process, India can learn and benefit \nfrom the lessons and experiences of countries that have established PPP programs, such as \nMexico, Chile, the United States, and the Philippines. These lessons are: \n1.  Detailed PPP policy and planning. This is to bolster the confidence and attract the \nparticipation  of  private  investors  and  commercial  lenders.  Governments  need  to \ndevelop a policy on unsolicited proposals from the private sector. PPPs can succeed \nonly if they are structured and planned in detail, and are managed by expert teams. \nGovernments also need to use technical and financial advisors where needed, to \nmatch the advantages of the private sector, particularly in large-scale programs. \nProject development needs to be done by government, which needs to invest in \ndevelopment by creating dedicated funds. \n29 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 80    Geethanjali Nataraj \n \n2.  Proper allocation of risks. Effective PPP models involve sensible division of roles \nand fair sharing of responsibilities, costs, and risks between the public and private \nsectors. Optimal, not maximum, assignment of risk is the principle that needs to be \nadopted. \n3.  Provide adequate protection for lenders. Public private partnerships should be \ndesigned in such a way so as to provide adequate protection to debt service against \nnon-commercial risks related to force major regulatory changes, contract termination, \netc. Avoiding renegotiations and midway changes to save costs and delays will also \nhelp secure lenders. A concession agreement should be structured in such a manner \nas to cover all possible causes of later adjustments, leaving minimum room for \nrenegotiations.  A  key  lesson  learned  from  international  experience  is  that \ngovernments often become over-enthusiastic to procure private sector participation \nby offering excessively concessional terms to the project company. This needs to be \navoided. \n4.  Development of public sector capacity. Public sector capacity to prioritize, plan, \nappraise, structure, bid, and financially close PPPs remains the top-most challenge \nto the mainstreaming of PPPs at the state and central levels. \n5.  Full  and  clear  support  by  government. Support for the PPP program and for \nspecific PPP projects has to come from the highest political level of government. \nStrong political will is essential in overcoming resistance and needs to be seen as a \nclear sign of the government\u2019s intention to meet its contractual commitments.  \n6.  Proactive  public  communication  and  stakeholder  management.  Many  PPPs \nhave  failed  due  to  strong  opposition  from  civil  society,  local  media,  and  other \nstakeholders.  Feedback  and  consultations  with  citizens,  labor  unions,  relevant \ngovernment agencies, private investors, civil society organizations, and media will \nensure public support, client focus, and improved coordination of the project. \n7.  Role  of  multilateral  agencies.  Multilateral agencies have welcomed the recent \nsteps taken by GOI with respect to VGF and IIFCL. Agencies like ADB and World \nBank  could  assist  GOI  in  promoting  PPPs  across  sectors  and  regions  of  India, \nthrough a range of financing, advisory and technical assistance (TA) measures. Most \nimportantly, these agencies would be able to assist GOI in tailoring PPP solutions to \nspecific demands of the individual states, sectors, and projects.  \n8.  Support  capacity-building.  State  presentations  have  highlighted  the  need  for \ncentral assistance in capacity-building and have underlined this as critical in the long-\nterm success of PPPs at the state level. In response to a request from the DEA and \nbased on the feedback from a workshop series, ADB has agreed to extend TA to \ngovernments  in  order  to  mainstream  PPPs  at  the  central  and  state  levels  via \ncapacity-building support, including assistance in the establishment of PPP cells at \nstate levels.  \n9.  Potential financing options for PPPs. ADB has re-engineered and operationalized \nnew ways of doing business to provide more client-oriented services for state and \ncentral  level  infrastructure  development  initiatives.  ADB  may  also  consider  if \nnecessary, extending loans (multi-tranche financing facility, local currency loan) to \nqualified projects in several forms. These forms include: (i) public sector loans to \nstates/municipalities/executing agencies for financing counter-grants/equity support, \nland, or engineering design; (ii) public sector loans to IIFCL (financial intermediary \nloan) which would, in turn, provide funds to project companies; (iii) private sector \nloans or equity investments by the private sector operation arm of the ADB to project \ncompanies; and, (iv) provision of guarantee to commercial lenders. \n30 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 80    Geethanjali Nataraj \n \n7. CONCLUSION AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS \nUntil the early 1990s, governments basically monopolized the infrastructure sectors in the \nSouth Asian region. Thus governments had a two-fold role\u2014they were policy makers and \nregulators  while  they  simultaneously  owned  the  companies  that  provided  infrastructure \nservices. Governments were responsible for guaranteeing an adequate infrastructure for the \npopulation  but  also  had  to  ensure  that  providers  had  sufficient  resources  to  invest  in \nexpanding their services. However, the weak financial situation of most infrastructure sectors \nand an inadequate access to services showed that governments were not able to adequately \nfulfill these roles.  \n \nFrom the early to mid-1990s, countries in the South Asian region saw a wave of initiatives \naimed at attracting private investment in their infrastructure sectors. The perception was that \nif the enormous investment needs of the countries were to be met, private foreign capital \nwould have to be attracted. Soon it became apparent that such investments would not be \nforthcoming  solely  on  the  basis  of  policy  statements.  It  became  apparent  that  private \ninvestors  were  concerned  about  the  conflicts  arising  from  the  multiple  roles  played  by \ngovernments  in  the  region.  As  a  result,  governments  agreed  to  establish  independent \nregulatory commissions in key infrastructure sectors. Governments hoped that this measure \nwould also reduce the perceived political risk of investing in infrastructure sectors.  \n \nIndividual South Asian countries have focused their reform efforts on different sectors. For \nexample, in Sri Lanka a reform of the telecommunications sector was given priority. India \nhas embarked on major reform programs in both electricity and telecommunications and \nreform proposals for petroleum and natural gas are underway. Bangladesh is proposing a \nsingle regulatory structure for electricity and natural gas. In all these countries, the ultimate \nobjective is to improve efficiency in these sectors and attract private investments to develop \ninfrastructure.  \n \nA close examination of private sector initiatives and PPPs shows the following constraints for \nPPPs in South Asia, specifically in countries with large economies, such as India: \n \n\u2022  There is a weakness in government enabling policies and regulatory framework. \nSubstantial work needs to be done to make sector policies and regulations PPP-\nfriendly. In an economy like India\u2019s, for instance, a large number of these projects are \nin the states and without the active participation of the states it would not be possible \nto achieve satisfactory results.  \n \n\u2022  The market presently does not have adequate instruments and capacity to meet \nlong-term equity and debt financing needed by infrastructure projects. \n \n\u2022  There is also a lack of credible, bankable infrastructure projects, which could be \noffered for financing to the private sector. Some initiatives have been taken both at \nthe central as well as the state level to develop PPP projects. These tend to be \nisolated cases and have demonstrated a marked lack of consistency.  \n \n\u2022  There is also a lack of capacity in public institutions and officials to manage the PPP \nprocess. As these projects involve long term contracts covering the life cycle of the \ninfrastructure  asset  being  created,  it  is  necessary  to  manage  this  process  to \nmaximize returns to all shareholders.  \n31 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 80    Geethanjali Nataraj \n \nPolicy suggestions \nBuild  consensus  for  PPPs.  There  is  little  consensus  among  stakeholders  on  the \nbenefits of involving the private sector in infrastructure development\u2014especially in power \nand water utilities\u2014in part due to ideological opposition and limited experience with \nprivate participation. Moving ahead successfully with PPP projects in the medium-term \nwill require continued efforts to build awareness of the positive experiences of PPPs, \nhold consultations with policy-makers and other key stakeholders on the range of options \nfor PPPs, and address stakeholders\u2019 concerns at the beginning of the planning and \ndesign stage.  \n \nMove toward cost recovery. Prices for infrastructure services in South Asia generally \ncover only a small share of the costs. Public and political opposition to involving the \nprivate sector often rests on concerns about price increases and exclusion of the poor. \nTo be politically acceptable, a move toward cost recovery is likely to be gradual and must \nbe accompanied by efforts to reduce inefficiency. In addition, the design of PPP projects \nshould include innovate ways to deliver subsidies to the poor.21 \n \nEstablish PPP professional units. Countries involved in PPPs on a large scale need to \nset up dedicated, cross-sectoral professional units to support project implementation, \nwith responsibilities ranging from disseminating information and preparing guidelines to \ndesigning and implementing transactions. These units can guide and complement the \nefforts of line ministries and provincial governments to develop frameworks for PPPs, \nmethodologies  for  evaluating  PPP  options  and  associated  fiscal  costs,  standard \ncontracts, guidance on managing the bid process, and monitoring and evaluation tools.  \n \nEase financing constraints. Financing infrastructure projects is a challenge in South \nAsian countries, where financial markets are shallow and there are limited options for \nfinancing long term projects. To ease financing constraints, priorities should include: \ndeveloping longer-term bond markets; developing investment policies and regulatory \nguidelines that encourage banks, insurance companies, pensions and mutual finds, and \nother financial institutions to help finance infrastructure projects; and, encouraging the \nuse of innovative financing instruments to mitigate lender\u2019s risks. To help close the \nfunding  gap,  the  governments  of  Bangladesh,  India,  and  Pakistan  are  establishing \nfacilities to provide long term finance for infrastructure projects.  \n \nThe opportunities for private investment in infrastructure projects are immense. As the reach \nof PPPs increases across sectors, the capacity of the private sector to manage these \nprojects over their entire life cycles of two to thirty years will also have to be enhanced. As \ngovernments move forward with PPP programs, the factor most critical to success will be \ntheir commitment to minimizing the constraints to private participation.  \n                                               \n21 The  policy  implications  are  in  part  drawn  from  the  Gridlines,  Note  No.  6,  May  2006  (Public-Private \nInfrastructure advisory facility) of the World Bank titled, \u201cLifting constraints to Public-Private Partnerships in \nSouth Asia,\u201d by Bhavna Bhatia and Neeraj Gupta.  \n32 ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 80    Geethanjali Nataraj \n \nReferences \n \nArndt, R. 1999.  \u201cIs build-own-operate transfer a solution to local government\u2019s infrastructure \nfunding problems?\u201d Taking Engineering to Government; transactions of \nmultidisciplinary engineering, BOT type of construction procurement. 5(1), August, \n42\u201357. \n \nAsian Development Bank, ADB\u2019s Infrastructure Operations: Responding to Client Needs, \nMarch 2007, Manila. \n \nBiehl, D Ed. 1986.
