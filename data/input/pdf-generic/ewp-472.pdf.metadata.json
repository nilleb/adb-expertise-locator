We find that boardroom gender diversity is low in Asia with \n7.5%  female  representation  on  average  in  2012, but  showing  a  1.8%  improvement  in  2013.  The \nappointment of female directors and a gender-diverse boardroom are on average positively associated \nwith  a  firm\u2019s  subsequent  performance,  but  with  large  cross-country  and  cross-measurement \ndifferences. Firm performance is the highest when there are two females on the board. Using two-\nstage analyses, we find that (i) a firm\u2019s past performance does not predict its choice to add female \ndirectors;  (ii)  cross-country  differences  in  female  corporate  leadership  respond  to  its  economic \ndemand and supply as measured by gender equality in college education, labor participation, wages, \nand infant survival; and (iii) female representation on the board, when determined by these economic \nfactors, is a significant predictor of a firm\u2019s future performance. \n \n \n \n \nKeywords: corporate performance, development equality, director choices, female leadership \n \nJEL codes: G38, J71, O16 \n \n ", " \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n \nGender diversity in corporate leadership concerns efficient allocation of human talents as an economic \nresource. This issue has increasingly attracted the attention of academics and regulatory institutions in \nrecent years. Many governments explicitly urge corporations to increase female representation in \nboardrooms and senior management positions. For example, the United Kingdom (UK) proposes a \nminimum of 25%, Norway mandates 40%, and Germany mandates 30% female representation in \nboardrooms. These legislative initiatives are based on the view that tapping female talent pools could \npositively  affect  corporate  governance  and  performance.  Academic  studies  using  European  and \nUnited States (US) data, however, could not arrive at a definite conclusion. For example, while Carter, \nSimkins,  and  Simpson  (2003)  show  a  positive  relation  between  gender  diversity  and  corporate \nperformance, Adams and Ferreira (2009) find a negative effect.  \n \nAsian countries have been relatively less proactive in pressuring gender diversity compared \nwith European countries. Research results based on European empirical data are not necessarily \napplicable  to  Asian  countries  because  of  differences  in  cultures,  demographics,  and  economic \ndevelopment. As such, studies based on Asian data could inform more effective policies and provide \nmore practical guidance for Asian corporations and economies than references based on foreign \nexperiences.  \n \nThis paper examines gender diversity practice and its impact on corporate performance in \nAsia,  and  in  particular,  assesses  the  magnitude  of  the  effects  and  peculiarities  that  pertain  to \ndeveloping Asia. To achieve these goals, we first provide a comprehensive description of gender \ndiversity of corporate boardrooms in 10 economies in Asia and the Pacific. Second, we conduct \neconometric analyses to assess whether gender diversity impacts firm performance and through which \nchannels gender diversity affects firms\u2019 performance, e.g., productivity, operational profitability, or \nmarket evaluation. Finally, we explore the cross-country differences of gender diversity in Asian \nboardrooms.  \n \nAside from comprehensiveness, we also stress rigorousness in the empirical methodology used \nin  conducting  the  analysis.  Specifically,  as  empirical  correlations  based  on  the  cross-sectional \ninferences are likely to suffer from the omitted-variable and reverse-causality problems\u2014e.g., whether \nit is the firm\u2019s past performance determining the decision of hiring women, or the decision of hiring \nwomen affecting future firm performance, or whether both performance and diversity are determined \nby other unobserved variables\u2014we will employ a two-stage econometric method and an instrument-\nvariable  approach  to  address  these  issues.  The  international  coverage  of  the  data  allows  for \ncomparisons across countries and industries and exploration of how labor market conditions and \neconomic development may affect the gender diversity practice and its impact on corporations.  \n \nWe find that boardroom gender diversity is lower in Asia and the Pacific compared with North \nAmerica and Europe. Australia has the highest diversity in the region and the Republic of Korea the \nlowest. The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has the least public emphasis on gender diversity, but its \nfemale representation in boardrooms has grown the fastest. India and Malaysia are the only countries \nthat impose mandatory quotas for gender diversity. The implementation, however, is a different issue. \nWe also find that firms that have at least one female on the board significantly outperform other firms. \nAppointment of a female director is also positively associated with firms\u2019 return on assets (ROA) and \nreturn on equity (ROE) in the subsequent year. There is, however, no predictive power between \ngender diversity and financial performance after we control for endogeneity issues in the analysis. \nMoreover, the cross-country differences in gender diversity are related to the economic demand and ", "2   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 472 \nsupply of female leaders measured by gender equality in education, labor participation, wages, and \ninfant survival. Overall, this study supports the notion that females are underrepresented in corporate \nleadership. The lack of gender diversity, however, does not necessarily result from inefficient or \ndiscriminatory corporate hiring decisions but rather from the premarket conditions for gender equality \nin the society. \n \nGender diversity is an important topic for economic and social development. We believe that a \ncomprehensive and thorough study like this one, with discoveries in the aforementioned dimensions of \ngender  diversity  in  boardrooms  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  will  make  a  valuable  contribution  in \nunderstanding and improving the economic well-being of people in the region. \n \nIn particular, our study suggests that the selection of corporate leaders is influenced by \neconomic factors and displays large cross-country differences. A mandatory quota, therefore, is not \nequivalent to an efficient method of allocating human talents. Government policies promoting gender \ndiversity in corporate leadership may focus on promoting the social conditions for gender equality. \nEquality in talent fostering could be a Pareto improvement in developing human capital, which in turn \ncontributes to economic growth.  \n \nThe rest of the report is organized as follows. In section II, we review the existing literature on \nthe theories, practices, and performance implications of gender diversity in boardrooms. We also \ndescribe in this section the recent recognition of the importance of gender diversity by corporations, \nacademics,  and  government  policies  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  Section  III  details  the  data  and \nmethodologies used in the empirical analyses. Section IV describes the gender diversity status in Asian \nboardrooms. Section V presents the empirical association between boardroom gender diversity and \nfirm performance. Section VI investigates the causal relations between gender diversity and financial \nperformance and explores the cross-country differences in gender diversity. Section VII concludes \nthe report.  \n \n \nII.  CONCEPTS, LITERATURE, AND HYPOTHESES \n \nA.  Conceptual Questions \n \nBoardroom gender diversity refers to the balance of gender composition of corporate boards. Males \nhave conventionally dominated corporate leadership. Despite the improvements in female education \nand labor participation, and governments\u2019 social efforts to promote gender balance in recent decades, \nfemales are still underrepresented in the boardrooms of most countries compared with population \ncomposition in general or in specific areas such as higher education, the labor force, and corporate \nmanagement.  \n \nNot  only  do  gender-imbalanced  boardrooms  violate  social  equality,  gender  balance  in \ncorporate leadership is important for allocating human talents and hence efficiency in decision making \nby leaders. Such a balance becomes particularly important if men and women on average substantially \ndiffer in their skill sets, social preferences, risk appetites, or value systems. As the leaders control \nresources and make investment decisions that set the path for the future, gender imbalance in \ncorporate leadership can not only cause an inefficient allocation of current resources, it is also likely to \nperpetuate the inefficiency and distort the future business world.  \n ", "Women\u2019s Leadership and Corporate Performance   |   3 \nExamining the relation between female leadership and corporate performance sheds light on \nthese important issues. Based on Becker\u2019s discrimination theory, firms that discriminate based on \nnontalent-related factors in their hiring decisions will underperform. Therefore, by examining the \nrelation between gender diversity and firm performance, we can infer the allocative efficiency of \nhuman talents without assuming the existence of prejudice.  \n \nTo do so, this study attempts to answer the following questions: First, is the gender ratio \nimbalanced in corporate leadership? Second, what are the causes of this imbalance? Third, are there \nskill and preference differences between men and women and what are the economic implications of \nthese  differences  in  decision  making?  Finally,  what  are  the  inefficiencies  associated  with  gender \nimbalance and how does gender diversity affect firms\u2019 economic performance? To answer these \nquestions, we first provide an overview of gender diversity statistics around the world. We review the \nliterature to summarize what academia and industry have already learned about the gender diversity \nsituation, and identify the remaining questions and their implications. Finally, we empirically investigate \nthe status of gender diversity and its relation to corporate performance in Asia. \n \nB.  Gender Diversity around the World \n \nTwo measures are generally used to examine the proportionality of women on corporate boards: \n(i) the percentage of companies that have at least one woman on their board, and (ii) the percentage \nof corporate board seats held by women. For female representation in senior management positions, \nthe percentage of senior management positions held by women is often used. In the analysis relating to \nfinancial performance, we also use an indicator for the appointment of one or more female directors to \nmeasure the change in gender diversity.  \n \nThe North American and European firms on average do better in both measurements of board \ngender diversity compared with firms in Asia and the rest of the world. Searching various sources and \nreports, we find that in 2012, 90% of the US Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 companies had at least one woman \non their board. In 2011, 60% of the FP500 Canadian companies had at least one woman on their board. \nIn the UK, 79% of the FTSE100 companies had at least one woman on their board in 2011, and that \nratio had risen to 93% by 2014. The percentage of European companies with at least one woman on \ntheir board was 86% in 2012. For the Scandinavian countries, there is at least one woman director on \nevery board. In Greece, Italy, and the Netherlands, however, almost a third of all corporate boards are \ncurrently still 100% male.  \n \nBased on the 2013 data reported in Dieleman, Qian, and Ibrahim (2014), the percentage of \nfemale representation in the board of directors is high in North America but low in Asia. As Table 1 \nshows, 40.5% of board seats in Norway are taken by females, 20.7% in the UK, and 16.9% in the US. In \nAsia, the country with the highest ratio is Indonesia (11.6%), Singapore is in the middle (8.3%), and the \nlowest is the Republic of Korea (1.9%). \n \nThe percentage of females in senior management, however, displays an almost opposite \ngeographic pattern, based on the report Women in Business: From Classroom to Boardroom, 2014 by \nGrant Thornton International. As Table 1 shows, while most of the European firms show less than 20% \nfemale  representation  in  corporate  senior  management,  the  ratio  is  above  40%  for  many  Asian \ncountries. \n \n \n \n ", "4   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 472 \nTable 1: Female Representation in Boardrooms and Senior Management Globally \n \nFemale Representation in Boardrooms Female Representation in Senior Management\nEconomy/Region  (%) Economy/Region (%) \nWestern  \nUnited States  16.9 United States 22 \nUnited Kingdom   20.7 United Kingdom 20 \nEuropean Union   16.6 Denmark 14 \nFinland  26.8 Germany 14 \nNorway  40.5 Holland 10 \nSweden  27.0 Switzerland 13 \nAsia / Pacific / Mideast \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China  8.5 Thailand 33 \nIndia  5.2 India 14 \nRepublic of Korea  1.9 Philippines 40 \nMalaysia  8.6  \nSingapore   8.3  \nJapan  2.0 Japan 9 \nHong Kong, China  9.6  \nIndonesia  11.6 Indonesia 41 \nAustralia  18.2 Armenia 35 \nNew Zealand  14.8 Georgia 35 \nSources:  Marleen Dieleman, Meijun Qian, and Muhammad Ibrahim. 2014.

Our review does not assume gender \nequality or inequality, but tries to learn what explains the cross-sectional differences in diversity, why a \ngap exists between men\u2019s and women\u2019s presence at the top of the corporate ladder, whether and why \nthe gap matters for financial performance, and what is the effect of government mandatory policies on \ngender diversity in corporate leadership.  \n \n1.  Explanations of Gender Diversity Status  \n \nFarell and Hersch (2005), based on the US Fortune 500 firm data from 1990 to 2000, show that \nadding a director is gender neutral. The likelihood of a firm adding a woman to its board in a given year \nis negatively associated with the number of women already on the board and positively associated with \nthe departure of another. Adams and Kirchmaier (2013) examine gender diversity and its relation to \nfemale labor participation in 22 countries over the period 2001\u20132010. They find that labor force \nparticipation and the presence of boardroom quotas are significantly related to the representation of \nwomen  on  boards.  Economic  and  cultural  factors  may  be  important  barriers  to  female  career \nadvancement, but preferences may be less important. They suggest that while quotas may overcome ", "Women\u2019s Leadership and Corporate Performance   |   5 \nproblems of discrimination, they may be too narrow a policy tool to address other causes of low female \nrepresentation in corporate leadership. \n \nGrant Thornton International (2015), drawing on 5,404 interviews in 35 economies and 20 in-\ndepth interviews with senior business leaders, reports that women\u2019s advancement is being constrained \nby a number of factors, from entrenched social norms and gender bias to parenthood and archaic \nbusiness practices. The report also recommends measures to improve the advancement of women in \ncorporate leadership. These measures include for society to stop holding female leaders up to a higher \nstandard, for the government to build the necessary infrastructure and legislation, for women to reach \nfor higher-level assignments, and for corporations to make a top-level commitment to support women \nleaders. \n \nThree theories have been proposed to explain the low ratio of female leadership: \u201cglass ceiling,\u201d \n\u201cmotherhood,\u201d and \u201cselection process.\u201d The glass ceiling argument views the low representation of \nfemales in corporate leadership as a remaining gender discrimination issue, given that women were \nhistorically  discriminated  in  social  rights  until  the  last  century.  Albrecht,  Bjorklund,  and  Vroman \n(2003), based on a survey of 19,941,998 individual laborers in Sweden, show that the gender wage gap \nin  Sweden  increases  throughout  the  wage  distribution  and  accelerates  in  the  upper  tail  of  the \ndistribution. They suggest that a gender-specific mechanism in the Swedish labor market hinders \nwomen from reaching the top of the wage distribution\u2014a glass ceiling effect in top management. After \nextensive controls for gender differences in age, education (both level and field), sector, industry, and \noccupation, the authors find that the glass ceiling effect in the raw data persists to a considerable \nextent. Lyness and Judiesch (1999) study over 30,000 employees from multinational financial services \nfirms in the US. Consistent with predictions based on sex stereotype research, they show that relative \nto men, women were more likely to be promoted than hired into management positions, and also \nrelative to men, women in higher-level positions received fewer promotions than women in lower \nlevels. Based on a 2-year follow up study with eBay employees, Angier and Axelrod (2014) report that \nwomen experience the company in strikingly different ways from men, even though they have equal \ndesire to move up. More women than men feel that they are not understood and their opinions are not \nlistened to. \n \nIntuitively, \u201cmotherhood\u201d interrupts career advancement. Bertrand, Goldin, and Katz (2010) \nconducted a web-based survey on University of Chicago MBA (Master of Business Administration) \nholders from the graduating classes of 1990 to 2006. They find that although male and female MBAs \nhave nearly identical earnings at the outset of their careers, their earnings soon diverge, with the male \nearnings advantage reaching almost 60 log points a decade after MBA completion. The divergence is \nlargely explained by higher career discontinuity and shorter work hours for female MBAs, which are \nlargely associated with motherhood. \n \nFinally, existing directors\u2019 behavioral habits, such as seeking people similar to themselves in the \nselection  process  for  new  members,  might  also  explain  the  persistence  of  low  gender  diversity. \nWestphal and Zajac (1995), based on US Fortune 500 firms during 1986\u20131991, show that powerful \nchief executive officers (CEOs) seek to appoint new board members who are demographically similar, \nand therefore more sympathetic, to them. Doldor et al. (2012) examine the appointment process of \nnonexecutive directors. They show that the intermediaries in this elite labor market, executive search \nfirms, assess candidates not only on their suitability for the role because of the skills they possess, but \nalso on subjective judgments of how they fit in with the current board. The increase in gender diversity \nis largely due to the 30% Club\u2014a group of chairpersons who champion gender diversity on boards.  \n \n ", "6   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 472 \nThe overall message from these studies is that the lack of gender diversity could be due to the \ndivision of social roles and rational behaviors, as well as discrimination. Economic and cultural factors \nare important in influencing female career advancement. \n \n2.  Differential Preferences by Gender \n \nAside from these social norm explanations, a large amount of literature has demonstrated that men \nand women substantially differ in their decision making, which may also shed light on gender balance. \nCroson and Gneezy (2009) summarize results from many economic experiments, identifying robust \ndifferences in risk preferences, social (other-regarding) preferences, and competitive preferences. \nStudies on these preference differences, however, show no conclusive results on any inefficiency \nassociated with female presence. In many cases, there are benefits associated with female presence \nand gender diversity. \n \nOn risk aversion, Sapienza, Zingales, and Maestripieri (2009), based on an experiment with a \nUniversity of Chicago 2008 cohort of more than 500 MBA students, show that women are generally \nmore risk averse than men. Specifically, they show that higher levels of circulating testosterone were \nassociated with lower risk aversion among women, but not among men. Based on a large survey of \ndirectors in Swedish firms in 2006, Adams and Funk (2012) show that female directors, in contrast to \n\ufb01ndings for the population, are less traditional and security oriented but more risk loving than male \ndirectors. Thus, having a woman on the board need not lead to more risk-averse decision making. Eckel \nand Grossman\u2019s (2008) review of experimental measures of risk aversion concluded that although \nwomen are found to be more risk averse than men in most studies, studies with contextual frames \nshow less consistent results. Furthermore, consistent with the idea that female managers are not \nnecessarily more risk averse than men, Adams and Ragunathan (2014) find that listed banks with more \nfemale directors did not engage in fewer risk-taking activities around the 2007\u20132009 crisis and did not \nhave lower risk than other banks.  \n \nOn other social preferences, Adams and Funk (2012) show that female corporate directors in \nSweden are more benevolent and universally concerned but less power oriented than male directors. \nAdams and Ferreira (2009) show that female board directors in US firms during 1996\u20132003 had \nbetter attendance at board meetings and were more likely to join monitoring committees. Consistent \nwith Adams\u2019 studies, Srinidhi, Gul, and Tsui (2011) survey 258 controllers of Fortune 1000 firms and \nfind that, correcting for selectivity bias and controlling for other known board, firm, and industry \ncharacteristics, there are significantly higher audit fees in firms that have at least one female director \nand in firms with a higher proportion of female directors on the board. That is, boards with female \ndirectors are more likely to demand higher monitoring in the form of more audit effort, ceteris paribus.  \n \nOn competition preference, Gneezy, Niederle, and Rustichini (2003) show that women may \nbe less effective than men in competitive environments, especially when women have to compete \nagainst men rather than in single-sex competitive environments. Hogarth, Karelaia, and Trujillo (2012), \nhowever, suggest this ineffectiveness might be exactly associated with lack of gender diversity. They \nstudy gender differences in competitive environments by exploiting the \"naturalistic experiment\" of a \ntelevision game show where participants are self-selected and there are no gender-specific constraints \nor discrimination. In multiple rounds, contestants answer general knowledge questions privately. One \nparticipant is eliminated or leaves voluntarily at the end of each round. Women earn 40% less than \nmen and exit the game prematurely at a faster rate, but especially when in a minority. Echoing on the \ncompetition externality of team diversity, Apesteguia, Azmat, and Iriberri (2012) use the 2007, 2008, \nand 2009 editions of the L'Oreal e-Strat Challenge, which includes 37,914 participants from 1,500 ", "Women\u2019s Leadership and Corporate Performance   |   7 \ndifferent universities in 90 different countries, to investigate whether the gender composition of teams \naffects  their  economic  performance.  They  find  that  for  undergraduates  across  all  performance \ndistributions, three-woman teams are outperformed throughout, but by as much as 0.47 of a standard \ndeviation of the mean at the bottom and by only 0.09 at the top. For MBA students at the top, the \nbest-performing group is two men and one woman.  \n \nStudies on gender-specific preferences overall suggest the following: First, female leaders don\u2019t \nmake less efficient decisions for corporations than male leaders. Second, women could make better \nmonitors  than  men.  Finally,  gender  diversity  is  actually  desirable  for  the  best  performance  in  a \ncompetitive environment.  \n \n3.  The Relation between Gender Diversity and Firm Performance \n \nWhile some studies show negative value associated with gender diversity, other research suggests that \ngender  diversity  is  associated  with  positive  performance,  especially  when  there  is  not  a  quota \nrequirement. Carter, Simkins, and Simpson (2003) find significant positive relation for US Fortune \n1000 firms in 1997 between the fraction of women or minorities on the board and firm value, after \ncontrolling for size, industry, and other corporate governance measures. Adams and Raguathan (2014) \nshow that banks with more gender-diverse boards had better performances during the 2007\u20132009 \ncrises. Erhardt, Werbel, and Shrader (2003) also show that, for 127 large US public companies during \n1993 and 1998, the percentage of women and minorities on boards of directors is positively associated \nwith firms\u2019 ROA and return on investment.  \n \nFemale  representation  in  the  boardroom  is  positively  associated  with  not  only  financial \nperformance but also accounting quality. Srinidhi, Gul, and Tsui (2011), based on US firms during \n2001\u20132007, find that firms with greater female participation on their boards exhibit higher earnings \nquality. That is, gender diversity improves the oversight function of the board. \n \nAdams and Ferreira (2009), however, show that the average effect of gender diversity on firm \nperformance is negative for US firms during 1996\u20132003. They argue that the negative effect is driven \nby firms with fewer takeover defenses. Consistent with the takeover defense effect, Huang and Kisgen \n(2013) show that male executives undertook more acquisitions and issued debt more often than \nfemale executives in US firms during 1993\u20132005. Levi, Li, and Zhang (2014), based on S&P 1500 \ncompanies during 1997\u20132009, also find that each additional female director is associated with 7.6% \nfewer bids, and each additional female director on a bidder board reduces the bid premium paid by \n15.4%. Their findings support the notion that female directors help create shareholder value through \ntheir influence on acquisition decisions.  \n \nAnother way to address the value of gender diversity is to examine performance changes upon \nnew appointment of female directors. The evidence is again mixed. Farell and Hersch (2005) show \nthat, based on US Fortune 500 data from 1990 to 2000, board gender diversity is positively associated \nwith firm performance, but there is no significant abnormal return on the announcement of a woman\u2019s \nappointment to the board. Dieleman, Qian, and Ibrahim (2013), however, show that new appointment \nof female directors is positively associated with better firm operating performance compared with \nappointment of male directors. Campbell and Minguez-Vera (2010) focus on the impact of female \ndirectors in Spain during 1989\u20132001. They find that the stock market reacts positively in the short term \nto  the  announcement  of  female  board  appointments  and  that  firms\u2019  market  value  is  positively \nassociated with female board appointments over the long term, too.  \n \n ", "8   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 472 \nIn  short,  there  is  no  universally  conclusive  evidence  on  whether  increasing  female \nrepresentation in boardrooms will improve firms\u2019 financial performance. There are large cross-country \nand cross-firm-group differences. However, studies that support the value-adding notion of female \nrepresentation in corporate boardrooms seem to outweigh studies that support value-neutral or \nvalue-destroying notions after controlling for various latent variables.  \n \n4.  Quota Requirement on Gender Diversity  \n \nShould the appointment of women directors be a response to internal or external calls for diversity or \nbased on qualifications? Will a quota lead to younger and less experienced boards, increases in \nleverage and acquisitions, and deterioration in operating performance? Many European countries have \nadopted mandatory quotas for gender diversity. Evidence from these natural experiments where \nquotas are mandated by the government show that quota systems effectively improve diversity, but \nresults are mixed on the value-added from that diversity improvement.  \n \nAhern and Dittmar (2012) examine the effect of the quota requirement on board diversity for \n248 publicly listed Norwegian firms during 2003\u20132009. They find that the 2006 announcement of the \nquota\u2014a target of 40% female directors at a time when only 9% were in place\u2014caused a significant \ndrop in the stock price and a large decline in Tobin\u2019s Q over the following years. Despite businesses\u2019 \nfear that there were not enough qualified women to fill the board positions and the poor reaction of \nthe market, Bertrand et al. (2015) show that the new reserved seats were filled with women who are \nobservationally better qualified to serve on boards than the women appointed before, suggesting that \nthere was indeed a glass ceiling stopping qualified women from rising. Matsa and Miller (2013) \nexamine the effect of this same quota introduction on corporate policy decisions. They find that the \naffected Norwegian firms undertook fewer workforce reductions than comparison firms\u2014other \nScandinavian companies that are not affected. The effects are strongest among firms that had no \nfemale board members before the quota was introduced and present even for boards with older and \nmore experienced members.  \n \nIn some other scenarios, even imposing a quota won\u2019t help to increase diversity itself, much \nless the performance. Lukas (2014) studies such a case in Germany. As German corporations have \nsupervisory boards aside from boards of directors, the proposed quota is restricted to supervisory \nbodies on which there is employee representation. It covers only about 100 of Germany\u2019s listed \ncorporations. Thus the policy will affect only a modest share of the workforce.  \n \nDifferent from the quota approach, Australia imposes a mandatory announcement and \ndisclosure rule for appointing directors. Using these data, Adams, Gray, and Nowland (2011) show that \nthe gender of directors appears to be value relevant. On average, shareholders value additions of \nfemale directors more than they value additions of male directors. Firms with workplace practices in \nplace to promote workplace equality appear to benefit the most from boardroom gender diversity.  \n \nAgain, the evidence is mixed on the value effect of mandatory quotas or disclosure rules on \ngender diversity. There are not only cross-country differences but also differences due to the \nmeasurement of performance. There is no theory or evidence supporting the notion that there exists a \nuniversally optimal level of female representation for all firms. \n \n \n \n ", "Women\u2019s Leadership and Corporate Performance   |   9 \n5.  Other Implications \n \nEmployment might be an objective for overall economic performance. Matsa and Miller (2011), based \non a survey of US business owners in 2007, find that privately held firms owned by women were less \nlikely than those owned by men to downsize their workforces during the Great Recession, controlling \nfor firm and industry characteristics. Women-owned firms operate with greater labor intensity after the \nprevious recession and are less likely to hire temporary or leased workers. These patterns extend \nprevious findings associating female business leadership with increased labor hoarding. \n \nWhat about influences on the next generation? Beaman et al. (2012), exploiting a randomized \nnatural experiment in India (a 1993 law that reserved leadership positions for women in randomly \nselected village councils), show that female leadership in the village influences adolescent girls\u2019 career \naspirations and educational attainment. Using 8,453 surveys of adolescents aged 11 to 15 and their \nparents in 495 villages, they find that, relative to villages in which such positions were never reserved, \nthe gender gap in aspirations closed by 20% in parents and 32% in adolescents in villages assigned a \nfemale leader for two election cycles. The gender gap in adolescent educational attainment is erased, \nand girls spend less time on household chores. There is, however, no change in young women\u2019s labor \nmarket opportunities, which suggests that the impact of women leaders primarily reflects a role model \neffect. \n \nFrom  a  management  point  of  view,  there  are  also  features  that  make  female  leadership \ndesirable. Fitch and Agrawal (2015) suggest that female bosses are more engaging than male bosses. \nBarsh (2014) believes that women and men leading as equals can fix capitalism\u2019s current relentless \npush for ever-increasing short-term profits and deliver meaningful impact over the long term instead. \n \nIn sum, female leadership demonstrates a positive effect on social welfare measurements such \nas employment and development of young girls. As these social measures are important for economic \nstability and sustainability, it is necessary to evaluate gender diversity using these measurements, \nwhich go beyond short-term indicators such as corporate financial performance.  \n \nD.  Asian Countries\u2019 Recognition of Gender Diversity Compared with Western Countries \n \nWhile the international literature is overall inconclusive on the corporate value effect of gender \ndiversity and the necessity of imposing a diversity quota, it does suggest that gender diversity provides \npositive value in corporate governance and social dimensions. In Asia, however, gender diversity in \ncorporate boardrooms is low, and there are few studies of this imbalance. The attention to gender \ndiversity has risen in Asia in recent years. A recent report published by the National University of \nSingapore presents the views of government, the private sector, and civil society on how female \nleadership will impact development in Asia (Tuminez, and del Mar Garza, eds. 2014). Another report \nby Korn Ferry International in 2012 provides a description of gender diversity in the corporate boards \nof Asian countries.  \n \nThis subsection reviews recent industry and government initiatives and policies to promote \ngender diversity in boardrooms, other corporate leadership positions, and firms in general. While many \nNorth European countries set quotas for gender diversity in firms, India and Malaysia are the only \nAsian countries that have done so. On 27 June 2011, the Malaysian Cabinet approved a policy that \nrequires companies with more than 250 employees to have 30% of senior management positions filled \nby women by 2016. India\u2019s law requires all listed firms to have at least one female on the board by \nMarch 2015. Many firms complied with the law by appointing the wives of the controlling owners. \n ", "10   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 472 \nOne-third failed to comply at all. Nevertheless, except for the PRC, whose corporate governance code \ndoes not even mention gender as a desirable quality of prospective board members, the other Asian \ncountries show some degree of attention to gender diversity.  \n \nStarting on 1 January 2011, the Australian Securities Exchange required listed firms to publicly \ndisclose their gender diversity ratio, establish measurable and individualized objectives and goals, and \ndisclose in annual reports the ratio and the skills and diversity that the board is looking for. Similarly, \nthe Hong Kong Stock Exchange requires firms to disclose and adopt a diversity policy, or otherwise \ndisclose why not to do so. For New Zealand, the stock exchange states that listed firms might soon be \nrequired to publicly disclose how many women and minorities they have in senior roles and as \ndirectors.  \n \nIn Singapore, professional-based organizations such as BoardAgender have been established \nto promote and facilitate the advancement of women into senior management and board positions. In \nJapan and the Republic of Korea, politicians seem to pay more attention than industry. For example, \nformer  Japan  Prime  Minister  Abe  suggested  a  ratio  of  30%  female  representation  in  senior \nmanagement at a time when that figure was only 1%. In the Republic of Korea, legislation was proposed \nbut not approved requiring state-run corporations and other public organizations to raise the ratio of \nwomen on their boards to 15% in 3 years and 30% in 5 years. \n \nDeriving  from  the  above  conceptual  discussion,  the  literature  on  theory  and  empirical \nevidence, and the practices, we can see the need for a better understanding of causes and impacts of \nfemale corporate leadership. The evidence is particularly sparse in Asia. In the next three sections, we \nwill empirically assess the situation in Asia. \n \n \nIII.  DATA AND METHODOLOGY \n \nA.  The Data \n \nOur sample includes 10 economies: Australia; the PRC; Hong Kong, China; India; Indonesia; Japan; the \nRepublic of Korea; Malaysia; New Zealand; and Singapore. For each economy, we include in the \nanalysis the top 100 largest listed firms in terms of their market capitalization during the years 2013 and \n2014. These 1,000 sample firms cover the following industries: materials, utilities, financials, real estate, \nhealth care, consumer discretionary, industrials, energy, information technology, consumer staples, and \ntelecommunication services. Figure 1 shows the industry distribution of these 1,000 firms, with the \nlargest portion in the consumer discretionary industry and the lowest in information technology. The \ndistributions are similar across countries. As Figure 1 shows, no particular sector dominates the sample. \nIt is hence unlikely that any sector will drive the empirical results. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "Women\u2019s Leadership and Corporate Performance   |   11 \nFigure 1: Industry Distribution of the Sample Firms\n \n3.3%\n11.3% 8.2% 5.1%\n5.3%\n14.5%\n5.4%\n8.7%\n18.0%\n5.6%\n14.6%\nMaterials Utilities\nFinancials Real estate\nHealth care Consumer discretionary\nIndustrials Energy\nInformation technology Consumer staples\nTelecommunication services  \n \nSource: Author\u2019s own calculation based on 2012\u20132013 observations from Korn Ferry International. \n \nWe  access  the  data  through  the  Centre  for  Governance,  Institutions  and  Organisations \n(CGIO) that obtains the data from Korn Ferry International. We observe each firm\u2019s financials from \n2011 to 2014 and board composition in 2012 and 2013.The short time series may not be ideal for \nanalyses  to  disentangle  causalities.  We  therefore  conduct  robustness  tests  using  a  panel  of \nSingaporean firms with 7 years of observation. The financial variables in the sample include ROA, ROE, \ncurrent ratio, leverage, coverage ratio, market capitalization, stock prices, assets turnover ratio, profit \nmargin, and cash flow ratio.  \n \nFor board composition, we observe each board member\u2019s relation with the firm (independent \nor  executive  member),  age,  education,  gender,  ethnicity,  participation  in  board  committees,  and \nattendance at board meetings. For 2012, we observe the board characteristic values from firms\u2019 reports \nin December 2011 or June 2012, and the 2013 values are from reports in March, June, September, and \nDecember. \n \nB.  Empirical Methods \n \nWe measure gender diversity with female representation (%) and an indicator for at least one female \non the board. For the descriptive part, we also include indicators for females in a variety of board \ncommittees and an indicator for females as corporate leaders, e.g., chairperson or CEO. In relating \ngender diversity to performance, we also look at new appointments of female directors.  \n \nWe measure firm performance with ROA and ROE, and market valuations. The 1,000 sample \ncompanies studied have an average ROA of 6.2% and ROE of 13.3%. \n \nIn describing the gender diversity situation in Asian boardrooms, we use descriptive statistics \nand univariate comparison. In analyzing the relation between gender diversity and firm performance, \nwe use regression analysis in addition to the descriptive comparison. Finally, we use two-stage least-\n ", "12   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 472 \nsquares (2SLS) and Heckman\u2019s Lamda approaches to disentangle the causalities, e.g., whether it is the \nfirm\u2019s past performance determining the decision to hire women, or the decision to hire women \naffecting future firm performance. In the first stage, we investigate the determinants of gender diversity \nusing the predetermined firm, industry, and country characteristics; in the second stage, we predict \nfuture firm performance with the actual gender diversity in firms while controlling for the predicted \ngender  diversity  calculated  from  the  first-stage  estimation.  With  the  predicted  gender  diversity \ncontrolled, the estimated coefficient on the actual gender diversity in the second stage captures the \nfinancial effect of the unexpected change in female leadership. A significant coefficient on the gender \ndiversity measurement in this setting hence suggests that gender diversity has predictive power on firm \nperformance.  \n \nSpecifically, we run the following regressions:  \n \nGender Diversity   = a +b* performance  + c*IV +d*Char\nit  it-1 it-1 it-1 \n \n+ Industry FE + \u03c9   (1) \nit\nPerformance   = \u03b1+\u03b2*Gender diversity  + \u03b3 *predicted gender diversity    \nit+1 it 0 it\n+ \u03b3 *Char   +Industry FE+ \u03b5    (2) \nit it+1\n \nwhere i and t denote for firm and year. Firm characteristics include total assets, age, leverage, and profit \nmargin. Note that the above two-stage analysis is equivalent to Heckman\u2019s Lamda approach when \ngender diversity is measured by a discrete choice variable, such as whether a female director is \nappointed and whether there is at least one female on the board. \n \nWe need instrument variables that are correlated with gender diversity measurements but not \ncorrelated with performance measurements in the first stage. For the firm-level instrument, we use the \nratio of female presence on the board in the past year. For the country-level instruments, we use \ngender equality measurements that potentially affect the demand and supply of female corporate \nleaders: specifically, the gender equality in college entrance (the number of female college registrants \nover the number of male college registrants), female labor force participation (%, the number of \nfemales in the labor force over the total number of females of working age), wage equality (%, the \naverage female wage over the average male wage on similar jobs), and the equality in infant survival (%, \ngirls\u2019 survival rate over boys\u2019 survival rate). The data are from the World Bank\u2019s Gender Equality Data \nand Statistics.  \n \nFormal education and working experience are critical in developing managerial and leadership \nskills. The first two instruments, college education and labor participation by females, hence can be \npotential determinants of the supply of female corporate leaders. Using data from 73 developing \ncountries, Amin and Islam (2015) show that countries with a higher proportion of female top managers \nalso have higher enrollment rates for women relative to men in primary, secondary, and tertiary \neducation.  The  market  demand  of  the  female  leadership,  however,  is  hard  to  measure  directly. \nNevertheless,  as  increased  demand  for  female  talent  brings  better  prospects  for  girls\u2014which \nencourages better care of girls by the parents\u2014we can use the girls\u2019 infant survival rate (benchmarked \nto boys\u2019) to proxy for the demand. Finally, as wage is an endogenous part of the labor market, wage \nequality can affect and be affected by both the demand and supply of female workers and leaders. A \npay gap between men and women is a reality, even in countries with legal mechanisms to reduce the \ngap. Bernard (2014) reports that equality-related pay analysis in US firms only responds to litigation \nrisk, and the process is opaque.

Gender Diversity and Performance\u2014Univariate Comparison  \n \nTo understand the relation between gender diversity in corporate boardrooms and the performance of \nthose corporations, we start by comparing financial performance between groups of firms that differ in \ntheir boardroom gender diversity.

As Figure 8A shows, in the pooled full sample and half of the \ncountries, firms with at least one female on the board outperform firms that have all-male boards. For \nexample, based on the 1,000-firm sample, the former have an ROA of 6.6% while the latter have 5.7%, \na  discrepancy  of  0.9%.  The  discrepancy  is  the  largest  in  New  Zealand,  where  all-male  boards \nunderperform by 3.2%, followed by the PRC at 2.1%.

Board Member Appointment and Firm Performance \n \nAnother approach to assess the effect of board diversity on firm performance is to examine the \nperformance following appointment of female directors. We compare ROA, ROE, and stock market \nreturns at the end of 2013 for firm groups categorized by whether there is a female director(s) \ndeparture, appointment, or no change from June 2012 to June 2013. As Figure 10 shows, firms that \nappointed at least one female director during this period have the highest ROA at 6.9%. This group \nalso has the highest female director ratio on average. Firms that have no change in the number of \nfemale directors have the lowest ROA. This group also has the lowest ratio of female directors. When \nwe measure financial performance with ROE, the worst-performing group is firms with no change in \nthe number of female directors, but the other two groups\u2019 ROEs are similar. In fact, returns are slightly \nhigher in the group where net departure of female directors occurred.  \n ", "Women\u2019s Leadership and Corporate Performance   |   21 \nAlthough comparisons within individual countries might provide a better understanding of the \neffects of turnover of female directors, there are only 43 firms with net departures and 82 with net \nappointments of female directors  in the full sample. This small sample, if further divided by 10 \ncountries, will result in a small sample size with low reliability of statistical inferences. \n \nFigure 10: Female Director Appointment and Departure  \nand Firm Performance \n \n20\n15.9\n15.6\n15 14.3 13.9\n11.0 11.3\n%10\n6.9\n5.5 5.1\n5\n0\nROA ROE Stock market return\nFemale departure No change Female appointment\n \n \nSource: Author\u2019s own calculation based on 2012\u20132013 observations from Korn Ferry International. \n \nFor comparison, we also examine firm performance followed by turnover of male directors. As \nFigure 11 shows, the departure, appointment, or change of male directors does not appear to affect \nsubsequent firm performance. The different effects of female versus male director turnover on firms\u2019 \nfinancial performance suggest that appointing a new female director might be relatively more value \ngenerating than appointing a new male director, based on this sample.  \n \nFigure 11: Male Director Turnover and Firm Performance  \n \n20\n16.6 16.5\n15 13.9\n12.7\n11.1 11.3\n%10\n5.6 5.3 5.3\n5\n0\nROA ROE Stock market return\nMale departure No change Male appointment\n \nSource: Author\u2019s own calculation based on 2012\u20132013 observations from Korn Ferry International. \n ", "22   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 472 \nBelieving the preferential or behavioral differences between men and women, one may guess \nthat it is easier for a female director to exercise her differences and to generate synergies when there is \nalready at least one other female on the board. To assess this conjecture, we divide the firms that \nappointed new female directors during June 2012 to June 2013 into three groups: firms whose number \nof female directors on the board rose from zero to one, from one to two, and from two to more. We \nthen compare these groups\u2019 performance following these appointments.

Controlling for Firm and Industry Characteristics  \n \nUnivariate comparison has omitted other variables that affect performance. The omission becomes a \nproblem if these variables are correlated with gender diversity. In this section, we use regressions to \ncontrol for firm and industry characteristics. We conduct the regressions in the full sample with \ncountry fixed effects and for each individual country separately. \n \nIn Table 2, we use gender diversity, firm characteristics, industry, and country fixed effects to \nexplain  firms\u2019  financial  performance  in  the  next  year.  The  coefficients  of  gender  diversity  on \nperformance and their corresponding t-statistics denoting the significance are reported. Each pair of \ncoefficient and t-statistics in brackets is from an independent regression with the full sample. That is, \nthe table is a summary of nine regressions. We find that firms\u2019 ROA and ROE are positively associated \nwith female ratio on the board and appointment of new female directors. For example, a 1% increase in \nthe female director ratio is associated with a 4.38% increase in firms\u2019 ROA in the next year. The stock \nmarket\u2019s view on gender diversity is, however, mixed. Although firms with at least one female on board \noutperform firms with all-male boards by 5.38% in stock returns, the response to the appointment of \nnew female directors on the market valuation is negative.

ADDRESSING THE SELECTION AND REVERSE CAUSALITY ISSUES \n \nThe relation between gender diversity and firm performance presented in section V represents an \nassociation rather than a causality between them. In this section, we use two-stage regressions to \nexamine whether there are any causalities between them. In the first-stage regressions, we examine \nthe determinants of gender diversity and in the second-stage regressions, we examine whether the \n ", "24   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 472 \nactual  gender  diversity  change,  with  the  predicted  gender  diversity  controlled,  impacts  firm \nperformance. In both stages, the explanatory variables are lagged by 1 year relative to the dependent \nvariables. In the first-stage analyses, we include both the firm-level and the country-level instruments \nthat are related to gender diversity but not directly related to firm performance.  \n \nIn Table 4, we present the results of the two-stage analyses using data from the 10 countries. \nThe first three columns address the causality between financial performance and having at least one \nfemale on the board; the next three, the appointment of a new female director; and the last three, \nfemale representation on the board. Panel A presents the results on the determinants of gender \ndiversity and Panel B presents the impacts on firm performance.  \n \nAs Panel A of Table 4 shows, none of the past performance measurements have any significant \nexplanatory power on any measurement of firms\u2019 boardroom gender diversity. The autocorrelation of \nfemale ratio in the boardroom is 0.81, which is consistent with the low turnover rate of board directors \nin practice. For each 1% increase in the female ratio in the past year, the likelihood that there is still at \nleast one female on the board this year increases by 35%.  \n \nMoreover, the instruments we choose significantly explain the gender diversity in cross section. \nThe standard errors for these country-level instruments are clustered at the country level. As a supply \nmeasurement, gender equality in college education is significantly and positively associated with \nboardroom gender diversity, although female labor participation shows a surprisingly negative effect. \nOne possible reason is that the available labor participation data include statistics for female workers \nat all levels. Women who take leadership positions constitute only a small portion of the total. While \nwage equality is an endogenous variable in labor market dynamics, the negative coefficient implies that \nthe demand-side effect is stronger than the supply-side effect. Finally, as expected, infant survival \nequality has a negative and significant relation to boardroom gender diversity.  \n \nPanel B of Table 4 shows that the predicted gender diversity (estimated from the first-stage \ndeterminants analysis) predicts positive future firm performance. However, the actual gender diversity, \nwhich includes the unexpected shock in diversity, has no predictive power on future firm performance.  \n \nTable 5 presents the results from the two-stage analyses with the Singapore 7-year panel data. \nThe empirical findings are similar to the data from the 10-country analyses. Note that, as a one-\ncountry sample, we have only the firm-level instrument in the first stage. \n \nOverall, these two-stage analyses deliver the following messages. First, past performance does \nnot explain gender diversity\u2014the reverse causality argument is not true.  Firms do not necessarily \nincrease female representation when performing well. Second, firms\u2019 existing female representation \nand female leadership supply and demand are the main determinants of firms\u2019 addition of female \ndirectors. Third, the association between gender diversity and firm performance, documented in \nsection V, is predictable using past information. There is no predictive power on firm performance \nwhen gender diversity deviates from the predicted level.  \n \nAs the most important past information is the firm\u2019s boardroom gender diversity and gender \nequality in the premarket conditions, the value associated with gender diversity is therefore valid.

CONCLUSIONS \n \nThis paper reviews the concept, theory, and international evidence on gender diversity and its relation \nto financial performance. We examine gender diversity in corporate leadership in 10 economies in Asia \nand the Pacific and find that gender diversity is overall lower in this region compared with North \nAmerica and Europe. Among the 10 economies studied, Australia has the highest female ratio in \ncorporate leadership and the Republic of Korea, the lowest. India and Malaysia are the only countries \nthat currently have mandatory gender diversity quotas for the senior management positions or boards. \nThe implementation is however poor in India. The PRC potentially loses economic value by the largest \nmagnitude because of the lack of gender diversity. \n \nOn the relation between gender diversity and firms\u2019 financial performance, we find that firm \nperformance  is  the  highest  when  there  are  two  females  on  the  board.  The  boardroom  female \nrepresentation  and  appointing  new  female  directors  are  positively  associated  with  the  firm \nperformance in the subsequent year. Consistent with the existing international empirical evidence, we \nalso find that the relation between gender diversity and financial performance display large cross-\ncountry and cross-measurement differences.  \n \nIn  the  two-stage  analyses  to  address  the  endogenous  concerns  on  gender  diversity \ndeterminants, we find the following. First, firms\u2019 past performance does not predict corporations\u2019 \nfemale director choices. That is, the reverse causality argument of financial performance to gender \ndiversity is not true. Second, the economic demand and supply of female leadership measured by \ngender equality in college education, labor participation, wages, and infant survival significantly explain \nthe cross-country differences in female corporate leadership. Third, female representation on the \nboard, when determined by the economic factors, predicts significant and mostly positive firm future \nperformance. There are, however, still cross-measurement differences. Finally, changes in gender \ndiversity that are unrelated to the economic factors have no predictive power on firm performance. \n \nOur findings generate clear and strong recommendations for government policies on gender \ndiversity in corporate leadership. On the one hand, arbitrary quotas of female representation in \nleadership without economic justification may produce little in terms of financial performance. On the \nother hand, government policies that aim to improve female leadership through improving the gender \nequality in society will be well rewarded in capitalizing on human talents. \n \n \n ", " \nREFERENCES \n \nAdams, R., and D.
