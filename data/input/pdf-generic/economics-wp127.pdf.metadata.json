Introduction\nA large and well-established empirical literature uses the gravity equation and cross-\nsectional data to investigate the effect of free trade agreements (FTAs) on international \ntrade flows. The overall balance of evidence from this literature is decidedly mixed, with \nsome studies finding a more significant effect than others. The most serious econometric \ncriticism of this literature is that almost all studies use exogenous right-hand-side dummy \nvariables to capture the impact of FTAs on trade. If, as is likely, the FTA dummy variable \nis endogenous rather than exogenous, ordinary least squares (OLS) may yield biased \nand inconsistent coefficient estimates. Omitted variables are an important source of such \nendogeneity bias. For example, the presence of omitted variables that reduce the volume \nof trade between two countries but increase the likelihood of FTA between them will \ncause the FTA coefficient to be underestimated.\nThe few studies that adjust for the endogeneity of FTAs use instrumental variables \non cross-sectional data. For example, Magee (2003) uses two stage least squares \nto estimate the effect of endogenous FTAs on trade but is unable to fine any reliable \nevidence\u2014the estimated effect ranges from large and negative to large and positive. \nBaier and Bergstrand (2007) contend that cross-sectional regressions yield biased and \ninconsistent coefficient estimates due to the inclusion of time-invariant omitted variables \nthat affect both FTA and trade. In other words, there are vast numbers of variables that \nare cross-sectionally correlated with both trade flows and the probability of having an \nFTA. Baier and Bergstrand address this fundamental shortcoming of cross-sectional \ntechniques by using panel data instead of cross-section data, and estimate the effect of \nFTA on trade via fixed effect (FE) and first differenced (FD) regressions. Both FE and \nFD regressions eliminate time-invariant omitted variables and thus allow for consistent \nestimates of time-varying variables. Their main finding is a significant and positive effect \nof FTAs on trade.\nIn this paper, we empirically examine the impact of an increasingly prevalent feature \nof FTAs, namely, overlapping of FTAs, which give rise to hub-and-spoke FTAs on \ninternational trade. The primary contribution of our paper is to enrich and strengthen the \nempirical literature on the relationship between FTAs and trade by explicitly incorporating \nthe hub-and-spoke nature of FTAs. We use the data and empirical framework of Rose \n(2004), and follow Baier and Bergstrand\u2019s approach to handling endogeneity. As of 31 \nDecember 2006, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/World Trade Organization \n(GATT/WTO) has been notified of 209 regional trade agreements (RTAs), of which ", "\u0018  |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 1\u00187\nFTAs accounted for about 64%1 Excluding the 44 service agreements and the 21 partial \nagreements, the proportion of FTAs rises further to 92%.2 Many FTAs overlap one \nanother and this allows some countries to become a hub in a network of FTAs. Relative \nto non-hub countries, an FTA hub country enjoys preferential access to more markets \nand hence an advantage in terms of export competitiveness. To the extent that such an \nadvantage translates into more exports and hence trade, the hub-and-spoke feature of \noverlapping FTAs will have a positive effect on trade, above and beyond the direct, trade \nliberalizing effect of FTAs.3\nThe concept of hub-and-spoke trade systems is not new to the trade literature but \nempirical analysis has been limited to a few country-specific studies. Our contribution to \nthe hub-and-spoke trade literature is that we apply the concept to hubs and spokes to \nFTAs, and perform a comprehensive empirical analysis of the effect of hub-and-spoke \nFTAs on international trade using panel data for 99 countries from 1960 to 1999.4 Early \nworks on hub-and-spoke trade systems include examinations of Canadian trade policy by \nWonnacott (1975) and Wonnacott (1982). Kowalczyk and Wonnacott (1992) investigated \nthe hub-and-spoke trade system in the context of North American Free Trade Agreement \n(NAFTA). Puga and Venables (1997) theoretically analyzed how overlapping FTAs affect \nthe locational choice of industries under monopolistic competition. A forthcoming paper \nby Chong and Hur examined the welfare effects of hub-and-spoke FTAs for Japan, \nSingapore, and US using a computational general equilibrium model under perfect \ncompetition and monopolistic competition. What has been thoroughly lacking in the \nempirical literature on hub-and-spoke trade systems is a comprehensive analysis using \ndata from a large number of countries. Our paper will help to fill this gap in the literature.\nOur empirical analysis yields three main findings. First, FTAs have a significant and \npositive effect on trade. That is, FTAs do matter for trade. Second, the positive effect of a \nhub-and-spoke FTA on trade exceeds the positive effect of an FTA on trade. The greater \ntrade effect of a hub-and-spoke FTA is due to the export competitiveness advantage \nenjoyed by the hub country. For example, the hub country belonging to two FTAs (A and \nB) can sell its exports at a lower price in B than spoke countries that only belong to A. \nThird, our estimation results imply that hub-and-spoke FTA doubles bilateral trade after \n\u0004  See www.wto.org for more details about RTAs.\n2  Note that according to the counting method of the WTO, sometimes a new RTA is double-counted as one under \nGATT Article XXIV, the Enabling Clause or GATS (General Agreement on Trade in Services) Article V. For example, the \nFTA between Japan and Singapore reported as of \u00044 November 2002 is captured as a new RTA under GATS Article V \nas well. Another example is the FTA between India and Sri Lanka notified to WTO as of 22 June 2002 (date of entry \ninto force as of \u00045 December 200\u0004), which is categorized as a new RTA under the Enabling Clause.\n\u0004  A hub of overlapping FTAs is also attractive to foreign investors, who gain preferential access to multiple FTAs. \nWhile FTAs may thus promote foreign direct investment inflows, we do not examine those effects in this paper. \nOur paper looks at the trade effects of FTAs rather than the foreign direct investment effects of FTAs. Being an FTA \nhub also entails some costs. For example, a hub has to manage multiple sets of trade regulations such as those \npertaining to RoO.\n4  We use FTAs only up to \u0004999 due to the surge in the numbers of FTAs after 2000. Hence, including the FTAs formed \nafter 2000 may yield an upward bias to our results. Baier and Bergstrand (2007) also used FTAs data up to 2000 \nonly.", "Effects of Hub-and-Spoke Free Trade Agreements on Trade: Panel Data Analysis  |  \u0018\n14\u00bd years, which represents a 4.9% annual growth rate of trade. Our trade data indicates \nthat actual bilateral trade among FTA countries grew annually by 5.1% on average. \nTherefore, our empirical analysis, which incorporates the hub-and-spoke nature of FTAs, \nis able to generate trade growth rates that are fairly close to actual trade growth rates.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II defines the hub country and \nspoke country of overlapping FTAs, and presents stylized evidence about FTA hubs and \nspokes in the real world. Section III discusses the data and methodology we use for our \nempirical analysis. The section also explores in greater detail the FE and FD models that \nwe apply to panel data to address the endogeneity bias. Section IV examines the main \nresults emerging from our empirical analysis. We look at and compare the results from \nthe pooled OLS regressions, FE regressions, and FD regressions. Section V concludes \nwith some final observations.\nII.   Definition and Evidence of FTA Hubs and Spokes\nIn this section, we define hub country and spoke country in a world of overlapping \nFTAs, and examine the extent to which hub-and-spoke FTAs are an empirical feature of \nreal world trade. Measuring the trade effect of hub-and-spoke FTAs requires a precise \ndefinition of a hub and a spoke, which allows for their transformation into empirical \nvariables. We also look at the evidence of hubs and spokes, as we define them, to \nidentify which countries are real-world FTA hubs and get some sense of the prevalence of \nFTA hubs in the real world.\nA.   Definition of FTA Hub and Spoke\nThe following simple example is useful for giving the reader a more intuitive \nunderstanding of the hub-and-spoke concept. Suppose that Republic of Korea (henceforth \nKorea) has FTAs with the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Japan, but the PRC and \nJapan do not have an FTA with each other. In this case, Korea is clearly the hub country \nand the PRC and Japan are the spoke countries. Korea enjoys a price advantage in its \nexports to the PRC vis-\u00e0-vis Japan because its exports receive preferential treatment \nunder the Korea\u2013PRC FTA whereas Japanese exports do not. The preferential treatment \ntakes the form of lower tariffs and non-tariff barriers that reduce the prices of Korean \nexports relative to those of Japanese exports. Likewise, preferential treatment under the \nKorea\u2013Japan FTA will give Korean exports a price advantage relative to the PRC exports \nin the Japanese market. Therefore, in principle the FTA hub country in a hub-and-spoke \nFTA is able to export more and hence trade more in comparison with non-hubs. This \nexport competitiveness advantage gives countries a compelling incentive to become FTA ", "\u0018  |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 1\u00187\nhubs and may help to explain the proliferation of FTAs in the real world. To the extent that \nthe FTA hub country takes advantage of its favorable position, its actual export and trade \nvolume will rise. Therefore, a hub-and-spoke FTA will increase trade above and beyond \nan FTA, which is an empirically testable proposition we test in this paper.\nWhile the above intuitive example is conceptually helpful, a formal definition is required \nfor incorporating hub and spoke into our empirical analysis. We formally define hub and \nspoke as follows:\nSuppose that country i has bilateral FTAs with m countries (m is strictly \ngreater than one) and country j is one of the m countries. Country j \nis defined as a spoke country if it has bilateral FTAs with m-2 or less \ncountries among the m countries that have bilateral FTAs with country i. \nCountry i is defined as a hub if it has at least two spokes.\nFor example, suppose Korea has bilateral FTAs with the 10 member-states of the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Korea is defined to be a FTA hub \ncountry if at least two ASEAN countries, say, Indonesia and the Philippines, have FTAs \nwith eight or fewer ASEAN countries. In other words, according to our definition, an \nFTA hub country has at least two spoke markets. Let us assume that Indonesia and the \nPhilippines do not have an FTA with each other. Further assume that Indonesia does not \nhave an FTA with Malaysia, and that the Philippines does not have an FTA with Thailand. \nKorea has an export competitiveness advantage vis-\u00e0-vis Indonesia in Malaysia and the \nPhilippines as well as advantage vis-\u00e0-vis the Philippines in Indonesia and Thailand. \nTherefore, according to our definition, Korea is an FTA hub country since it has two spoke \nmarkets in Indonesia and Philippines. Note that it is theoretically possible for country i \nand country j to be each other\u2019s hub and spoke at the same time if both countries belong \nto more than two FTAs.\nB.   Evidence of FTA Hubs and Spokes\nOur primary data source for identifying FTAs and FTA hubs, as defined above, for the \nperiod 1958\u20132005 is the Regional Trade Agreements Notified to the GATT/WTO and \nin Force by Date of Entry into Force, available at the WTO website. The table provides \ndetailed information about 186 RTAs during 1958\u20132005. We excluded agreements for \ntrade in services since our analysis is more relevant for trade in goods, for which the \nadvantages of FTAs for exporters are more concrete. We also excluded preferential \nagreements that are not completely in the form of free trade areas or customs unions \nas specified by GATT Article 24. Those omissions reduce our sample size to 132 \nagreements, which are listed in Appendix A.5 Figure 1 below shows the number of new \nFTA hubs that have emerged each year during 1958\u20132005.\n5  There \u00044 agreements for trade in services and \u00048 preferential agreements. In addition, we excluded the \nCommonwealth of Independent States, which seems to be ineffective in the sense that many of its members have \nsubsequently entered into bilateral agreements with each other despite the Commonwealth\u2019s existence. We do, \nhowever, include those bilateral agreements. We also exclude Romania\u2019s accession to the Central European Free \nTrade Agreement (CEFTA) in \u0004997 because it was the only member at that time.", "Effects of Hub-and-Spoke Free Trade Agreements on Trade: Panel Data Analysis  |  \u0018\nFigure 1: Number of New FTA Hubs, 1958\u22122005\n45\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n1958 1965 1972 1979 1986 1993 2000\nTable 1 below ranks 211 countries in terms of the frequency of becoming a new FTA hub \n(denoted by Hi for country i and time t) during 1958\u20132005.6 Countries with the highest \nt\nfrequency of being FTA hubs (13 times) are the nine earliest members of the European \nUnion (EU). Six countries that joined EU at later dates have the second highest frequency \nof becoming FTA hubs while European Free Trade Area (EFTA) countries have the third \nhighest frequency. Eastern European countries such as Bulgaria, Romania, and Turkey \nhave also recently joined many FTAs and have become FTA hubs. Mexico (5 times) and \nthe US (4 times) have become FTA hubs in the Americas. Australia (3 times), Singapore \n(3 times), New Zealand (2 times), PRC (1 time), and Japan (1 time) are FTA hubs in the \nAsia and Pacific region. The overall evidence suggests that FTA hub countries are likely \nto be members of RTAs. In particular, EU members seem to be prominent FTA hubs.\nTable 1: Frequency of Becoming a New FTA Hub, 1958\u20132005\n\uf053 2005\nRanking Countries t=1\nHi\nt\n1 Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxemburg, \n13\nNetherlands, United Kingdom\n2 Greece, Portugal, Spain 11\n3 Austria, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland 9\n4 Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway 8\n5 Romania, Turkey 6\n6 Bulgaria, Israel, Mexico 5\n7 Armenia, Croatia, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, Macedonia, United States 4\n8 Australia, Chile, Moldova, Russian Federation, Singapore 3\n9 Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, El Salvador, Kazakhstan, \n2\nNew Zealand, Ukraine\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, Costa Rica, Cyprus, Czech Republic, \n10\nEstonia, Hungary, Japan, Jordan, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Nicaragua, \n1\nPalestine Authority, Poland, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, \nTunisia\n11 Rest of the world (151) 0\n\u0004  Some FTAs notified in 200\u0004 onward are still under negotiation.

Data and Empirical Framework\nOur primary data set is from Rose (2004), which uses the standard gravity model of trade \nto examine the impact of the WTO on international trade. The gravity model, a widely \nused workhorse of empirical analysis in international trade, explains the natural logarithm \nof bilateral trade with the logs of the distance between the two countries and their joint \nincome. Most applications of the gravity model include a number of explanatory variables \nin addition to distance and joint income. Since our data are from Rose (2004), we use his \nbasic empirical framework in the sense that we use the same explanatory variables. Rose \nasserts that his empirical strategy is to control for as many causes of trade as possible, \nwhich explains why the total number of variables in his data set is 43. As a result, we \nalso control for a large number of trade determinants in addition to those of central \ninterest to us, i.e., the FTA-related variables. Those variables are listed in Appendix C \nand include dummy variables for income levels (e.g., high-income); geographical location \n(e.g., East Asia); other geographical factors (e.g., landlocked); cultural/historical factors \n(e.g. common language) and status of WTO membership. The sample period of Rose\u2019s \ndata set is 1960\u20131999. ", "Effects of Hub-and-Spoke Free Trade Agreements on Trade: Panel Data Analysis  |  7\nWe supplement Rose\u2019s data set with our data for FTAs and FTA hubs. As noted earlier, \nour primary source of data for these variables is the Regional Trade Agreements Notified \nto the GATT/WTO and in Force by Date of Entry into Force, available at the WTO \nwebsite and reproduced in Appendix A. We construct an FTA variable and two FTA hub \nvariables from all RTAs notified to the WTO between 1960 and 1999.  Merging Rose\u2019s \ndata set with our data set for FTAs and FTA hubs leaves us with a balanced panel data \nset consisting of 99 countries (see Appendix B) and running from 1960 to 1999.7 As \nBaier and Bergstrand (2007) point out, FTAs are typically phased in over 5\u201310 years and \nthus will not become fully effective before this time period. Therefore, following Baier and \nBergstrand, we exclude from our sample the post-2000 period that saw a surge of new \nFTAs.8\nWe now define the FTA variable and the two FTA hub variables. FTAij=1 for two countries \ni and j if they have an FTA with each other and FTAij=0 otherwise. If FTAij=1, HUBij=1 \nfor country i if country i is an FTA hub with respect to country j and HUBij=0 otherwise. \nThe volume of country i\u2019s exports to country j will depend on whether the two countries \nhave an FTA with each other, and, if so, whether country i is an FTA hub with respect to \ncountry j.

These observations are dropped in \nFD regressions but not for OLS or FE regressions. We create a balanced panel so we can have comparable results for \ndifferent regressions. A balanced panel with a long time series also allows us to better address the problem of serial \ncorrelation.\n8  Including the post-2000 FTAs, which are likely to be less than fully effective due to the gradual nature of FTA-based \ntrade liberalization, will impart an upward bias to the estimated effect of FTA on trade, especially in light of the \nrapid growth of FTAs in the post-2000 period.

However, we must distinguish \nbetween two possible scenarios. First, only one of the two estimates is positive, i.e., \n(\uf06d >0, \uf06d =0) or (\uf06d =0, \uf06d >0). This implies that ai >ai  or aj >aj  and only one of the \n1 2 1 2 2 1 2 1\ntwo FTA partners is a hub country. Second, both estimates are positive so that \uf06d >0 and \n1\n\uf06d >0.

This is \nimportant because we want to separate out the FTA hub effect from the RTA membership \neffect.9 We follow Baier and Bergstrand (2007) in including up to six lags of FTAij in \nt\nthe estimation of equation (4).10 The lags capture an institutional feature of FTAs, i.e., \n9  It was earlier pointed out in Section IIB that members of RTAs, especially the EU, are prominent FTA hubs.\n\u00040 We also obtained the regression results that include up to \u00040 lags of FTA.

We also generalize the specification of equation (4) by including \ntime dummy variables.\nThe first-differenced form of equation (4) can be expressed as: \n\u2206lnTij =\u03b2\u2206Xij +\u00b5\u2206FTAij +\u00b5\u2206FTAHUBij +\u00b5\u2206FTAHUBji +\u2206\u03b5ij   (5)\nt t 0 t 1 t 2 t t\nNotice that the term  Xij  in (5) includes only the five time-variant explanatory variables \nt\nfrom Rose\u2019s data set while the term  Xij  in (4) includes all 43 explanatory variables \nfrom the same data set. Incidentally, the fixed effects model accounts for time-invariant \nvariables so that its estimation also requires only the five time-variant variables.\nAs noted earlier, the biggest econometric criticism of the empirical literature on the \nrelationship between FTAs and trade is that FTA variables are assumed to be exogenous \nrather than endogenous. To formally test for the exogeneity of FTAs, we perform the \nheteroskedasticity-robust C-test for exogeneity developed by Baum, Schaffer, and \nStillman (2003). Table 3 below reports the results, which show that for pooled OLS \nregressions, the C-test rejects the null hypotheses that FTAij and FTAHUBij are \nt t\nexogenous at the 1% significance level.11 In contrast, for the FE and FD regressions, \nthe C-tests cannot reject the null hypotheses that all three FTA-related variables (FTAij, \nt\nFTAHUBij and FTAHUBji) are exogenous even at the 10% significance level. Our C-test \nt t\nresults thus confirm Baier and Bergstrand\u2019s contention that the problem of endogeneity \ncan be addressed by using panel data and FE/FD regressions.\nBoth FE and FD regressions assume that the errors in the regressions are serially \nuncorrelated. If the errors are serially correlated, the FE and FD estimators may be \ninefficient and inconsistent. There is a risk of serial correlation since bilateral trade \nlevels in earlier years may affect current bilateral trade levels. We use the test for serial \ncorrelation outlined by Wooldridge (2002). Table 3 reports the results of the test, which \ninvolves running heteroskedasticity-robust OLS, FE and FD regressions on the residuals, \nand the lagged residuals. The results indicate serial correlation in the pooled OLS and \nFE regressions but not in the FD regressions.12 We correct for serial correlation in pooled \nOLS and FE regressions by using the Prais-Winsten (1954) transformation.\nWe also test for strict exogeneity since its violation may also result in inefficient \nand inconsistent FE and FD estimators. For this purpose, we use a test put forth by \nnot significant. The results for regressions that include up to \u00040 lags are available upon request from the authors.\n\u0004\u0004 In conducting the C-test of exogeneity, we have to assume excluded instruments correlated to FTA or FTAHUB but \northogonal to the error terms. However, as Baier and Bergstrand mention, it is difficult to find such instruments. For \nthe C tests of exogeneity, we use as instruments the lagged log values of per capita trade and lagged log values of \nthe sum of per capita real GDP. \n\u00042 The notes in Table \u0004 provide a more in-depth discussion of the test and results.", "10  |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 1\u00187\nWooldridge (2002). For FE model, the test involves running a FE regression on the \ndependent variable, the regressors and the lead (t+1) values of the subset of regressors. \nFor the FD model, the test involves running a regression on the FD dependent variable, \nFD regressors and a subset of regressors in levels. Based on the results, which are \nreported in Table 3, we can reject the null of strict exogeneity for the FE model but cannot \ndo so for the FD model.13 Therefore, the FD model, which does not suffer from serial \ncorrelation and does not violate strict exogeneity, is the most robust among the three \nmodels. Nevertheless, the estimates are broadly similar for the pooled OLS, FE, and FD \nregressions. This implies that endogeneity in pooled OLS regressions and violation of \nstrict exogeneity in FE regressions does not seriously bias the results.\nTable 3: Specification Tests\nolS Estimates FE Estimates FD Estimates\nVariable\nStatistic P-Value Statistic P-Value Statistic P-Value\nC-Test for Endogeneity\nFTAij 8.521 0.004 1.135 0.287 1.836 0.175\nt\nFTAHUBij 0.671 0.412 1.352 0.245 0.052 0.820\nt\nFTAHUBji 16.231 0.0001 0.928 0.335 2.224 0.136\nt\nTest for Serial Correlation\n0.898  0.000 0.743  0.000 \u22120.243  0.000\n\u03c1\n(0.002) (0.003) (0.004)\nTest for Strict Exogeneity\n0.271  0.000 \u22120.003  0.687\n\u03b3 \u2013 \u2013\n(0.032) (0.008)\nOLS = ordinary least squares, FE = fixed effect, FD = fixed difference, FTA = free trade area.\nNote:  As developed by Baum, Schaffer, and Stillman (200\u0004), the C-statistic is a test statistic for testing endogeneity of FTAji, \nt\nFTAHUBij, and FTAHUBji. The test has a null that a regressor is exogenous and an alternative that it is endogenous. The \nt t\nC-statistic has a chi-square distribution and is robust to heteroskedasticity. Woodridge (2002) outlines a test for serial \ncorrelation for OLS, FE estimates, and FD estimates. The test involves running heteroskedasticity-robust OLS, FE, and FD \nregressions on the residuals and the lagged residuals. Where \u03c1 is the coefficient of the lagged residuals, the null hypothesis \nis \u03c1 = 0 for no serial correlation under OLS and alternative hypothesis of serial correlation is \u03c1 \u2260 0 in OLS regression. For FE \nregression, the null hypothesis of no serial correlation is \u03c1 = -\u0004/(T-\u0004) and the alternative hypothesis of serial correlation is \n\u03c1 > 0. For FD regressions, the null hypothesis of no serial real correlation is \u03c1 = \u22120.5 and the alternative hypothesis of serial \ncorrelation is \u03c1 > 0. Wooldridge also specifies a regression-based tests for strict exogeneity in FE and FD models.

Empirical Results\nTable 4 reports our results for the pooled OLS, FE, and FD regressions. The pooled \nOLS and FE regressions have been corrected for serial correlation by the Prais-Winsten \ntransformation. We do not report the results for the 43 control variables in Rose (2004) \nbut they are available from authors upon request. In general, our results for those \nvariables are quite close to Rose\u2019s results, and most of the coefficient estimates have \nthe expected signs and are significant. For example, the effect of sharing a common \nborder on bilateral trade was positive and highly significant as was the effect of both \ntrading partners being Asian countries. Membership in RTAs also had a positive, highly \nsignificant effect on trade.14 On the other hand, the effect of distance between the trading \npartners was negative and highly significant, as was the effect of both partners being \nleast developed countries. The fact that our results for the 43 control variables are largely \nconsistent with economic intuition gives us some confidence that our empirical analysis \nwill be able to isolate and identify the effects of FTAs and their hub-and-spoke nature on \ntrade flows.\nFor our purposes, the most relevant coefficient estimates are those of the FTA variable \nand the two FTA hub variables, so we will focus upon those variables in our discussion \nof the results of the three regressions in Table 4. For the pooled OLS regressions, we \ninclude all of Rose\u2019s 43 explanatory variables but we only include the five time-variant \nvariables for the FE and FD regressions. The pooled OLS results show that FTAij has a \n \nsignificant and positive impact on bilateral trade after 2 years. That is, countries that have \nan FTA with each other trade more with each other than countries having no FTA with \neach other. The coefficient estimate of FTAHUBji is 0.076 and has a p-value of 6.0% while \n \nthe coefficient estimate of FTAHUBij is insignificant. The pooled OLS results thus lend \n \nsome support to a positive effect of hub-and-spoke FTAs on trade but, as noted earlier, \nthose results suffer from the endogeneity of the three FTA-related variables.\nThe results of the FE regressions, which do not suffer from endogenous FTA-related \nvariables, indicate that FTAij has a significant and positive impact on bilateral trade. The \n \naverage treatment effect of FTA, which refers to the notion that bilateral trade will differ \nbased on whether or not the two countries share an FTA, is 0.083 after 5 years. The \ncoefficient estimate of FTAHUBji is 0.108 and has a p-value of 3.2% while the coefficient \n \nestimate of FTAHUBij is insignificant. The total average treatment effect, or the sum of \n \nthe FTA effect and the hub-and-spoke FTA effect, is 0.191. The FE results thus lend \nstrong support to a positive effect of hub-and-spoke FTAs on trade but, as noted earlier, \nthe FE model is a first order autoregressive process that may violate the assumption of \nstrict exogeneity. Tests for strict exogeneity confirm that the assumption is violated, which \nimplies that the FE estimators may be inefficient and inconsistent.\n\u00044 As noted earlier, RTA members, especially EU members, figure prominently among FTA hubs. As such, we want to \nseparate out RTA membership effects from FTA hub effects.", "1\u0018  |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 1\u00187\nTable 4: Estimation Results for Heteroskedasticity-Robust OLS, Fixed Effect, and First-\nDifferenced Models (dependent variable: ln(ltrade)ij  )\nt  \nolS Estimation using  FE Estimation using Prais- FD Estimation\nthe  Prais-Winsten  Winsten Transformation\nTransformation\nRegressor Coefficient Robust  P-value Coefficient Robust  P-value Coefficient Robust  P-value\nstandard  standard  standard \nerror error error\nFTAij  \u22120.021 0.046 0.644 -0.050 0.065 0.441 0.009 0.042 0.821\nt\nFTAij t-1 0.012 0.019 0.517 0.013 0.032 0.680 0.000 0.018 0.986\nFTAij \nt-2 0.048*** 0.017 0.004 0.047 0.033 0.158 0.040** 0.016 0.011\nFTAij \nt-3 \u22120.088*** 0.023 0.000 \u22120.020 0.034 0.557 \u22120.002 0.017 0.895\nFTAij \nt-4 0.051*** 0.015 0.001 0.029 0.035 0.395 0.041*** 0.014 0.004\nFTAij \nt-5\n0.074*** 0.024 0.002 0.083** 0.040 0.039 0.070*** 0.024 0.003\nFTAij \nt-6\nFTAHUBij  0.066*** 0.019 0.001 0.066 0.039 0.096 0.056*** 0.018 0.002\nt\nFTAHUBji  \u22120.002 0.045 0.959 0.033 0.067 0.621 \u22120.004 0.041 0.921\nt\nSum  0.076* 0.041 0.060 0.108** 0.050 0.032 0.075* 0.040 0.061\nln(rgdp)jit  0.497*** 0.012 0.000 0.243** 0.011 0.000 0.171*** 0.014 0.000\nAdditional  \n43 4 4\nregressors\nTime \nYes Yes Yes\ndummies\nNo. of obs. 56576 56576 54912\nF-statistic  \u2013 85.93 0.000 47.16 0.000\nATE 0.168 0.215\n***, **, and * indicate \u0004%, 5%, and \u00040% levels of significance, respectively.\nOLS = ordinary least squares, FE = fixed effect, FD = fixed difference, FTA = free trade area, ATE = average treatment effect.\nNote:  ln(trade)ij is the ln of country i and j\u2019s total trade with each other; FTAij is dummy variable that is \u0004 if country i and country \nt t\nj have a free trade agreement (FTA) and 0 otherwise; FTAHUBij (FTAHUBji) a dummy variable that is \u0004 if country i (j) \nt t\nbecomes a hub when it enters into an FTA with country j (i) and 0 otherwise; sum ln(rgdp) is the sum of the log real GDP \nof country i and country j. \u03c1 is the coefficient of the lagged residuals to test for serial correction. It is calculated by running \nregressions on the residuals with the lag of the residuals. The residuals for the fixed effects and first differenced models are \nderived from regressions of time-demeaned and FD variables, respectively. The additional regressors are described in Rose \n(2004) and Appendix C. The results of the additional regressors are mostly significant with the correct signs. These results \nare not reported because of space limitation but are available from the authors upon request. The Prais-Winsten (\u0004954) \ntransformation adjusts for serial correlation. ATE is the average treatment effect with at least 5% level of significance. \nWe earlier saw that the FD regressions do not suffer from endogeneity, serial correlation, \nand violations of strict exogeneity. As such, the FD estimators are efficient and consistent, \nand the FD results are therefore likely to be the more robust and reliable than the \npooled OLS or FE results. The FD results indicate that the average treatment effect of \nFTAs at the 5% significance level, or the sum of FTAij coefficients significant at the 5% \n \nsignificance level is 0.207.

If we incorporate the \nhub-and-spoke nature of FTAs, the average treatment effect of FTAs rises further to \n0.282. This represents an annual growth rate of trade of about 4.9% and a doubling of \ntrade volume after 14\u00bd years.\nOverall, our empirical analysis based on pooled OLS, FE and FD regressions yields \ntwo main findings. First, FTAs have a positive and significant impact on bilateral trade \nbetween FTA members in all three regressions. Our results thus confirm the presence \nof average treatment effects for FTAs; i.e., whether two countries have an FTA or not \nmatters for the volume of bilateral trade. Furthermore, the positive and significant effect \nseems to materialize not immediately but with a time lag. Second, the hub and spoke \nnature of FTAs appears to reinforce and augment the significantly positive effect of FTAs \non trade. It is noteworthy that the estimated size of the hub-and-spoke effect is quite \nsimilar across the three regressions: 0.075 for FD, 0.108 for FE, and 0.076 for pooled \nOLS. This gives us some confidence about the robustness of our estimated hub-and-\nspoke effect. Interestingly and significantly, if we take into account both the direct effect \nof FTAs and the additional hub-and-spoke effect, the growth rate of trade implied by our \nFD results is 4.9%, which is quite close to the actual growth rate of 5.1% between FTA \nmembers computed from our data.\nV.   Concluding Observations\nAlthough the concept of hub-and-spoke trade systems is not new to the trade literature, \nwhat has been lacking in the literature is a systematic empirical analysis of their effects. \nWe hope that our paper helps to address this significant shortcoming in the literature. \nMore specifically, we apply the concept of hubs and spokes to FTAs and use a panel data \nset comprising 99 countries and covering 40 years (1960\u20131999) to empirically examine \nthe effect of FTA hubs and spokes on trade. Our point of departure is an increasingly \nprominent stylized fact of international trade in the real world, namely the overlapping \nof FTAs, which give rise to hub-and-spoke FTAs. Intuitively, an FTA hub belonging to \ntwo FTAs\u2014A and B\u2014enjoy a competitive advantage in exporting its goods vis-\u00e0-vis FTA \nspokes, which belong to only one of the two FTAs. The hub has a price advantage vis-\u00e0-\nvis A-only countries in the B market and price advantage vis-\u00e0-vis B-only countries in the \nA market. To the extent that this advantage results in higher exports and hence trade, we \ncan expect the hub-and-spoke feature of overlapping FTAs to increase trade above and \nbeyond the direct, trade-liberalizing effect of FTAs. \nIndeed one of our two main empirical findings is that the hub-and-spoke nature of FTAs in \na world of overlapping FTAs does indeed have a positive and significant effect on bilateral \ntrade among FTA members. More precisely, our results imply an average annual growth ", "1\u0018  |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 1\u00187\nrate of trade of 4.9% between FTA members and hence a doubling of bilateral trade after \n14\u00bd years. This growth rate of 4.9% implied by our regression results is remarkably close \nto the actual growth rate of 5.1% we computed from our data, which lends credibility to \nthe robustness of our results. The positive and significant effect of hub-and-spoke FTAs \nreinforces our other main empirical finding, namely a positive and significant effect of \nFTAs on trade. Our finding of a positive relationship between FTAs and trade reconfirms \nthe results of Baier and Bergstrand (2007), which do not account for hub-and-spoke \neffects. Their results imply a 7% annual growth rate of bilateral trade between FTA \nmembers and a doubling of trade after 10 years. However, the actual growth rate of trade \nwe computed from their data was only 4.3%, significantly below the growth rate implied \nby their regression results.\nAt a broader level, both our paper and Baier and Bergstrand represent efforts to improve \nand refine the empirical analysis of the relationship between FTAs and trade. In fact, we \nuse the methodology developed by Baier and Bergstrand to address the econometric \nissue of endogenous FTA-related variables. In this paper, we propose to further improve \nthe measurement of FTA\u2019s trade effects by accounting for a characteristic of FTAs \nhitherto neglected by the empirical literature. More specifically, we argue that in a world \nof overlapping FTAs, a more accurate estimation of the effect of FTAs on trade requires \ntaking into account the hub-and-spoke nature of FTAs. Furthermore, the proliferation of \nFTAs is likely to further increase the empirical relevance of hub-and-spoke FTAs in the \nfuture. Our empirical evidence provides some support for our argument that the empirical \nanalysis of FTAs would benefit from explicitly recognizing those effects.\nGiven the large and growing role of FTAs in international trade, it is of utmost importance \nto measure their impact as accurately as possible. This suggests there is plenty of scope \nfor useful future research. For one, the empirical literature fails to incorporate rules of \norigin (RoO). These rules are an essential part of FTAs and define the conditions under \nwhich the importing country will view a product as originating in an FTA partner. RoO \nentail costs, e.g., a Mexican firm\u2019s costs of certifying the Mexican origins of its exports \nto the US under NAFTA,  which introduce a protectionist bias. Inactive FTAs is another \npotential issue for future research. For example, an FTA may exist in name only if firms \nforego the FTA-based preferential treatment and act as if they were from outside the FTA \narea.

Alba, Jung Hur, and Donghyun Park investigate the effect of hub-and-spoke free \ntrade agreements (FTAs) on trade using panel data. They find that hub-and-spoke FTAs \nincrease trade above and beyond FTAs. More specifically, this type of FTA causes trade to \ndouble after 14-and-a-half years.\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nmember countries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their \npeople. Despite the region's many successes, i t remains home to two thirds of the world's \npoor. Six hundred million people in the region live on $1 a day or less. ADB is committed to \nreducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, \nand regional integration. \nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance. In 2007, it approved $10.1 billion \nof loans, $673 million of grant projects, and technical assistance amounting to $243 million.\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/economics\nISSN: 1655-5252\nPublication Stock No.: \nPrinted in the Philippines"], "metadata": {"Author": "Joseph D.
