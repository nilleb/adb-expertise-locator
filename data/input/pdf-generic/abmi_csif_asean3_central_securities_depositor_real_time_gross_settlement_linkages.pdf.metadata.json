The proposed RSI is to be based on bilateral links \n\nbetween national central securities depositories and central banks\u2019 real-time gross settlement systems. \n\nThis\u00a0model can realize cross-border delivery versus payment settlement to enable safe and efficient \n\ncross-border financial transactions. The report also highlights emerging trends and challenges in\u00a0cross-border \n\nfinancial transactions and sets out next steps in establishing an RSI.\n\nAbout the Cross-Border Settlement Infrastructure Forum\n\nThe Cross-Border Settlement Infrastructure Forum is composed of the central banks and central securities \n\ndepositories of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Japan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, and the \n\nRepublic of Korea\u2014known collectively as ASEAN+3. The CSIF is mandated to facilitate discussions to improve \n\ncross-border bond and cash settlement infrastructure in the ASEAN+3 region, including the possibility of \n\nestablishing a regional settlement intermediary. The Asian Development Bank acts as secretariat to the CSIF.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific,  \n\nwhile sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 68 members  \n\n\u201449 from the region. Its main instruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue,  \n\nloans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\n\n10101011010101010110101010101001011101010101010010111010101010101010010111001010101010110101010101\n1110101010101010100101110010101010101110010111010101101010110101010101101010110101010101101010110\n10101011010101010110101010010111010101010101010010111001010101010111001011101010101010101001011100101010101011\n1001011100101010101011100101110101010101010110010111001010101010111001011101010101010101\n10101011010101101010101011011010101101010110101010101101101010110101011010101010110110101011\n1011010101010110110101011011011010101010110110101011011011010101010110110101011011011010101010110110\n0010101011011010101101101101010101011011011011011010101010110110010110110101011011011010101010110110\n010101011011010101101101101010101011011001010101101101010110110110101010101101100101010110110101011011011010101010110110\n10110110101011011011010101101101010110110110101011011010101101101101010110110101011011011010\n01010110110110101011011010101101100101011011011010101101101010110110010101101101101010110110101\n1101101010110110010101101101101101010110110010101101101101101010110110010101101100110110\n110110101011011001010110110110110101011011110110101011011001010110110110110101011011001010110110110110101011011\n101101101010110110010101101101101010111011011010101101100101011011011010101110110110101011011001010110110110101011\n10101110110110101011011001101011101101101010110110011010111011011010101101100110101110110110101011011001\n110101011011001101011101101101010110110011010101101100110101110110110101011011001101010110110011010111011011010101101100\n1100110101011011001101011101101100110101011011001101011101101100110101011011001101011101101100110101011011001101011101\n10011010111011011001101010110110011010111011001101011101101100110101011011001101011101\n011001101011101101100110101011011001101011011001101011101101100110101011011001101011011001101011101101100110101011011001101011\n1100110101110110110011001101011101101100110011010111011011001100110101110110110011001101011101101100\n101010110110011010110110011010111011010101011011001101011011001101011101101010101101100110101101100110101110110\n0110110011010111011001101100110101110110011011001101011101100110110011010111011001101100110101110110\n11001101011011001101011101101010101100110101101100110101110110101010110011010110110011010111011010101011001\n101010101100110101101100110101110110101010101010101100110101101100110101110110101010101010101100110101\n1010101011001101011011001101011101101010101010101011001101011011001101011101101010101010101011001101011011\n00110101110110101010001101011101101010100011010111011010101000110101110110101010100110101110110101010\n101010101100110101101100110101110110101010101100110101101100110101110110101010101100110101101100110101110110\n0101101100110101110110101010110110011010111011010101011011001101011101101010101101100110101110110101\n01101010101101100110101011010101011011001101010110101010110110011010101101010101101100110101\n10111011010101011011011101101010101101101110110101010110110111011010101011011011101101010101101\n010110011010110110010110011010110110010110011010110110010110011010110110010110011010110110\n001101011011001011001101011011000110101101100101100110101101100011010110110010110011010110110\n101100110101101101011001101011011010110011010110110101100110101101101011001101011011010110011010110110\n1011010110011010110110101100101101011001101011011010110010110101100110101101101011001011010110011010110110101100\n0101101101011001011010110010110110101100101101011001011011010110010110101100101101101011001011010110\n101100101101011001101101100101101011001101101100101101011001101101100101101011001101101100101101011001101\n\nNEXT STEPS FOR  \nASEAN+3 CENTRAL SECURITIES \nDEPOSITORY AND REAL-TIME  \nGROSS SETTLEMENT LINKAGES\nA Progress Report of the Cross-Border Settlement \nInfrastructure Forum \n\nJULY 2020\n\nAsiAn Development BAnk\n\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\n\nwww.adb.org\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n\n\fNEXT STEPS FOR  \nASEAN+3 CENTRAL SECURITIES \nDEPOSITORY AND REAL-TIME  \nGROSS SETTLEMENT LINKAGES\nA Progress Report of the Cross-Border Settlement \nInfrastructure Forum \n\nJULY 2020\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n\n\f   Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 IGO license (CC BY 3.0 IGO) \n\n \n\u00a9 2020 Asian Development Bank \n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City, 1550 Metro Manila, Philippines \nTel +63 2 8632 4444; Fax +63 2 8636 2444 \nwww.adb.org \n\nSome rights reserved.

well-developed local currency (LCY) bond markets is regarded as a cause of the maturity and \n\ncurrency mismatches\u2014also known as the \u201cdouble mismatch problem\u201d\u2014that negatively affected \n\nborrowers in the region during the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis. With that in mind, ASEAN+3 finance \n\nministers established the Asian Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI) in 2002 to boost the development of LCY \n\nbond markets to help mitigate the double mismatch problem and recycle the vast amount of savings \n\nwithin the region to support needed infrastructure investments.1  \n\nAs a way of promoting intraregional financial transactions under ABMI, the foundation of a regional \n\nsettlement intermediary (RSI) was proposed. In 2013, the Cross-Border Settlement Infrastructure Forum \n\n(CSIF) was established by regional central banks and central securities depositories to consider RSI \n\noptions. In 2014, after a series of studies and discussions, the CSIF chose central securities depository \n\n(CSD)\u2013real-time gross settlement (RTGS) linkage as a model for the RSI. CSD\u2013RTGS linkage is a \n\nbilateral linkage between two markets. By linking national CSD and central banks\u2019 RTGS systems in two \n\nmarkets, the model can realize cross-border delivery versus payment settlement to enable safe and \n\nefficient cross-border financial transactions. \n\nThis document explains the progress of ongoing CSIF discussions and explores the way forward. \n\nEstablishing a sound and efficient RSI is an effective way to stimulate intraregional financial investment. \n\nCSIF\u2019s continued discussion will support the development of an RSI and promote financial integration \n\nwithin ASEAN+3.  \n\nYasuyuki Sawada \n\n \n\nChief Economist and Director General \n\nEconomic Research and Regional Cooperation Department \n\n1  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)+3 comprises the 10 members of ASEAN plus the People\u2019s \n \n\nRepublic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n\nThe Cross-Border Settlement Infrastructure Forum (CSIF) was established under the Asian Bond Markets \n\nInitiative after being endorsed in May 2013 in Delhi at the meeting of finance ministers and central bank \n\ngovernors from members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as well as the People\u2019s \n\nRepublic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea\u2014a grouping that is collectively known as ASEAN+3. \n\nThe chair and vice-chair of the CSIF have been leading discussions to implement a regional settlement \n\nintermediary (RSI), with the Asian Development Bank serving as the Secretariat.

Based on \n\nthe findings, the CSIF has proposed central securities depository (CSD)\u2013real-time gross settlement \n\n(RTGS) linkage as the best model to establish an RSI. CSD\u2013RTGS linkage can be categorized into three \n\ntypes: (i) cross-border delivery versus payment (DVP), (ii) CSD\u2013CSD linkage, and (iii) RTGS\u2013RTGS \n\nlinkage for payment versus payment. The following are the models of the three types implemented or to \n\nbe implemented in the region: \n\n(i) \n\nthe first category shall rely on the cross-border DVP being developed by the Bank of \n\nJapan  and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) with the Bank of Japan Financial \n\nNetwork System Japanese Government Bond Services and the Clearing House \n\nAutomated Transfer System, targeted to be launched in spring 2021;  \n\n(ii) \n\nthe model for the second category is that of the China Central Depository & Clearing Co. \n\nLtd. and Korea Securities Depository implemented in 2017 based on a desktop study \n\n(iii) \n\nthe model for the third category is that of the HKMA and Hong Kong Interbank Clearing \n\nLimited connecting domestic and some cross-border RTGS systems (operating for years, \n\nconducted then; and  \n\nas mentioned in the report). \n\nTo take advantage of these accomplishments and initiatives, the CSIF may pursue moving toward \n\ncentralized integration based on such models that would lead to more bilateral agreements.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fxii \n\nExecutive Summary \n\nAlso, as a sign of growing regional cooperation under ABMI, all CSIF members will adopt international \n\nstandards, including ISO 20022 (possibly by 2023), as the basis for cross-border transactions. Further, \n\namid the current regulatory trend of collateralization in cross-border transactions, the CSIF discussed \n\nfreeing up the region\u2019s domestic collateral pools for use in cross-border transactions.  \n\nThe CSIF will also need to consider the implications of recent advancements in financial technology. \n\nDistributed ledger technology and blockchain will soon be employed as part of payment and settlement \n\ninfrastructure in the region. Given these rapid developments, it is necessary to take stock of the varied \n\nexperiences of CSIF members.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nThe Asian Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI) has conducted several studies on establishing a regional \n\nsettlement intermediary (RSI). The development of efficient and sound market infrastructure for regional \n\nsecurities settlement is regarded as one of the key components of ABMI. The Group of Experts published \n\na report in April 2010 that analyzed possible RSI models from the viewpoint of legal and business \n\nfeasibility. After the Group of Experts report, a series of reassessments were made and the establishment \n\nof a Cross-Border Settlement Infrastructure Forum (CSIF) was endorsed at the 2013 meeting in Delhi of \n\nfinance ministers and central bank governors from members of the Association of Southeast Asian \n\nNations (ASEAN) plus the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea (ASEAN+3). \n\nThe discussions at this meeting focused on the improvement of cross-border bond and cash settlement \n\ninfrastructure in the region, including the possibility of establishing an RSI.  \n\nThe CSIF consists of the central banks and national central securities depositories (CSDs) of ASEAN+3 \n\nmembers, with market regulators and officials from the region\u2019s ministries of finance joining as observers \n\n(Appendix 1). The CSIF reports to ABMI Task Force 4 (TF4) at least twice a year (Figure 1).   \n\nThe CSIF aims to \n\n(i) \n\nenhance dialogue among policy makers and operators of bond and cash settlement \n\ninfrastructure in the region;  \n\n(ii) \n\nassess existing settlement infrastructure and identify comprehensive issues and requirements to \n\nfacilitate cross-border bond and cash settlement infrastructure in the region; \n\n(iii) \n\ndevelop common basic principles for cross-border bond and cash settlement infrastructure with \n\nmedium- and long-term perspectives; and \n\n(iv) \n\ndiscuss prospective models, an overall roadmap, and an implementation plan for establishment \n\nof cross-border bond and cash settlement infrastructure in the region. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nNext Steps for ASEAN+3 Central Securities Depository and Real-Time Gross Settlement Linkages \n\nFigure 1: Structure of the Cross-Border Settlement Infrastructure Forum \n \n\nASEAN+3 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors\n\nASEAN+3 Deputies\n\nABMI Steering Group\n\nTASK FORCE\n\nTF1\n\nTF2\n\nTF3\n\nTF4\n\nTACT\n\nPromoting Issuance\nof Local Currency\n\nFacilitating the Demand\nof Local Currency-\nDenominated Bonds\n\nImproving Regulatory\nFramework\n\nImproving Related\nInfrastructure for the\nBond Market\n\nTechnical\nAssistance\n\n \nABMI = Asian Bond Markets Initiative; ASEAN+3 = Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus the People\u2019s Republic of China; \nJapan; and the Republic of Korea; CSIF = Cross-Border Settlement Infrastructure Forum; TACT = technical assistance and \ncoordination team; TF = task force. \n \nSource: Authors\u2019 illustration based on Asian Development Bank. 2019.

Explore the possibility of centralized integration \n\n(not just for major and global players). \n\nas long-term goal. \n\nPrinciple 6:  Consistency and collaboration with other initiatives: Explore greater benefit by maintaining \n\nconsistency and collaboration with other initiatives of the region. \n\nPrinciple 7:   Standardization: Standardize market practices and technical aspects among members as \n\nmuch as possible to minimize costs. \n\nPrinciple 8:  Harmonization of rules and regulations: Harmonize rules and regulations, as much as \n\npractical, that hinder cross-border transaction, including those that require holistic policy \n\nconsiderations such as capital controls and taxation, among others. \n\nProgress Report on Establishing a Regional Settlement Intermediary and \n\nNext Steps: Implementing Central Securities Depository\u2013Real-Time Gross \n\nSettlement Linkages in ASEAN+3 \n\nThe Progress Report on Establishing a Regional Settlement Intermediary and Next Steps: Implementing \n\nCentral Securities Depository\u2013Real-Time Gross Settlement Linkages in ASEAN+3, published in 2015, \n\ndescribed three types of CSD\u2013RTGS linkages: (i) cross-border delivery versus payment (DVP),  \n\n(ii) CSD\u2013CSD linkage, and (iii) payment versus payment (PVP) (Figure 3).  \n\n \nB. \n\n \n\nFigure 3: Central Securities Depository\u2013Real-Time Gross Settlement Linkage Model \n \nCSD-RTGS Link\n\nEconomy A\n\nCentral Bank\nRTGS (A)\n\nEconomy B\n\nCentral Bank\nRTGS (B)\n\nParticipant\nRTGS (B)\n\nPVP\n\nCross-\nborder\nDVP\n\nDVP\n\nDVP\n\nParticipant\nRTGS (A)\n\nParticipant\nCSD (A)\n\nCSD (A)\n\nCSD Link\n\nCSD (B)\n\nParticipant\nCSD (B)\n\n \n\n \nCSD = central securities depository, DVP = delivery versus payment, PVP = payment versus payment,  \nRTGS = real-time gross settlement.  \n \nSource: Adapted from Asian Development Bank. 2014. Basic Principles on Establishing a Regional Settlement Intermediary and \nNext Steps Forward. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fSalient Points in Previous Reports \n\n5 \n\n \nCross-border DVP connects an RTGS system for cash settlement and a CSD system for securities \n\nsettlement located in different economies to guarantee the settlement of both cash and securities \n\ncompletely. In other words, delivery of securities occurs if only if the correspondent payment (cash \n\nsettlement) occurs.  \n\nA CSD\u2013CSD linkage connects CSD systems located in two different economies, which enables to buy \n\nand sell securities in one economy from other economy.  \n\nPVP linkage connects RTGS systems located in different economies. PVP is a settlement mechanism \n\nthat ensures that the final transfer of a payment in one currency occurs only if the final transfer of a \n\npayment in another currency or currencies takes place.  \n\nIn the aforementioned report, the CSIF set out a roadmap for establishing CSD\u2013RTGS linkages in \n\nASEAN+3 (Figure 4). \n\nCSIF members also discussed (i) fit and gap analysis of cross-currency DVP, (ii) possible implications of \n\nCSD\u2013RTGS linkages, and (iii) policy recommendations and next steps. Regarding the fit and gap \n\nanalysis, further study has been made, the outcome of which was shared at subsequent CSIF meetings.   \n\nC. \n\nCommon Understanding on Cross-Border Business Continuity Planning \n\nand Cybersecurity \n\nCommon Understanding on Cross-Border Business Continuity Planning and Cybersecurity was published \n\nto establish a basic framework of cross-border business continuity planning (BCP) and cybersecurity, \n\nfocusing on cross-border CSD\u2013RTGS linkages. The CSIF recognized that all participants in CSD\u2013RTGS \n\nlinkages must have the same level of safety and soundness in their infrastructure. When connecting CSD \n\nand RTGS systems, the security measures of counterparty market infrastructure (CSD or RTGS system) \n\nare critical. As a prerequisite, CSD and RTGS systems must ensure sufficient levels of security to be \n\nconnected with other CSD and RTGS systems through the linkages. Otherwise, the network will be \n\nvulnerable. The report discussed five key elements necessary to establish sound and resilient cross-\n\nborder payment and settlement systems within the region: (i) governance, (ii) compliance, (iii) relevance, \n\n(iv) understanding, and (v) identification.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nNext Steps for ASEAN+3 Central Securities Depository and Real-Time Gross Settlement Linkages  \n\nFigure 4: Roadmap for Establishing a Regional Settlement Intermediary in ASEAN+3 \n \n\nSell side\n\nDeliverer\nAccount\nOwner\nInstructing\nParty\n\nCreditor\nAgent\nAccount\nOwner\nInstructing\nParty\n\n(a) sese.023\n\n(b) sese.024\n\n(h) sese.025\n\nSecurities Depository\n\nPSMS\n\nCSD Account Servicer\nExecuting Party\n\nSafekeeping a/c\n\nSafekeeping a/c\n\nSettlement amount X,XXX,XXX,XXX\n\n(g) TBD\n\nDVP\n\n(c) TBD\n\nCash Settlement\n\nRTGS Account Servicer\nExecuting Party\n\nCash a/c\n\nCash a/c\n\n(f) camt. 054\n\nSettlement amount X,XXX,XXX,XXX\n\n(a) sese.023\n\n(b) sese.024\n\n(h) sese.025\n\nBuy side\n\nReceiver\nAccount\nOwner\nInstructing\nParty\n\n(d) TBD\n\n(e) TBD\n\n(f) camt. 054\n\nDebtor Agent\nAccount\nOwner\nInstructing\nParty\n\nParticipant\nCSD (A)\n\nCountry A\nCSD (A)\n\nGW\n\nCSD Link\n\nGW\n\nParticipant\nCSD (B)\n\nCross-currency\n\nDVP\n\nDVP\n\nPVP\n\nParticipant\nRTGS (A)\n\nCentral Bank\nRTGS (A)\n\nGW\n\nCentral Bank\nRTGS (B)\n\nGW\n\nParticipant\nRTGS (B)\n\nCountry B\nCSD (B)\n\nDVP\n\nParticipant\n\nParticipant\n\nParticipant\n\nParticipant\n\nCentral\nBank\nRTGS\n\nCSD\n\nGW\n\nCentral\nBank\nRTGS\n\nCSD\n\nGW\n\nGW\n\nCSD\n\nParticipant\n\nParticipant\n\nParticipant\n\nParticipant\n\nParticipant\n\nParticipant\n\nGateway\n\nParticipant\n\nParticipant\n\nGW\n\nCSD\n\nGW\nCentral\nBank\nRTGS\n\nParticipant\n\nParticipant\n\nBN\n\nVN\n\nCN\n\nHub &\nB/U(s)\n\nHK\n\nID\n\nJP\n\nKH\n\nTH\n\nSG\n\nPH\n\nMY\n\n \n\n \n\nMM\n\nKR\n\nLA\n\n \n\n \nASEAN+3 = Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea;  \nBN = Brunei Darussalam; B/U = backup; CN = People\u2019s Republic of China; CSD = central securities depository; DVP = delivery versus \npayment; GW = gateway;  HK = Hong Kong, China; ID = Indonesia; JP = Japan; KH = Cambodia; KR = Republic of Korea;  \nLA = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; MM = Myanmar; MY = Malaysia; PH = Philippines; PSMS = Pre-Settlement Matching System; \nPVP = payment versus payment; RTGS = real-time gross settlement; SG = Singapore; TBD = to be determined; TH =Thailand;  \nVN = Viet Nam. \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank. 2015.

Manila. \n\n\fSalient Points in Previous Reports \n\n7 \n\n \nIdeally, this set of common elements should be reviewed and updated from time to time. When \n\nestablishing linkages among CSIF members, it is necessary to either consider a framework of mutual \n\nassurance or recognize the security framework of counterparty market infrastructure operators. In each \n\neconomy, operators of CSD and RTGS systems, as well as the financial authorities, oversee and \n\nexamine participants in their payment and settlement network. As the operators and financial authorities, \n\nthey can set standards and check the level of security of each network participant. In the case of CSD\u2013\n\nRTGS linkages, there is no central authority that can oversee the CSD and RTGS system operators of \n\nparticipating markets. Therefore, when connecting CSD and RTGS systems bilaterally, market \n\ninfrastructure operators of both sides of the transaction need to disclose and exchange necessary \n\ninformation. In addition, they may need to check each other\u2019s level of security to ensure the safety and \n\nsoundness of all systems when establishing linkages.1  \n\nCommon Understanding on International Standards and \n\nGateways for Central Securities Depository and \n\nReal-Time Gross Settlement Linkages \n\nCommon Understanding on International Standards and Gateways for Central Securities Depository and \n\nReal-Time Gross Settlement Linkages consists of two parts: (i) creating a common understanding among  \n\nCSIF members on international standards for those linkages, and (ii) establishing general user \n\nrequirements and technical specifications for linkage gateways. \n\nInternational standards to be used for CSD\u2013RTGS linkages \n\nInternational standards to be used for CSD\u2013RTGS linkages include \n\nInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO) 20022 for messages, \n\nISO 3166 for country codes, \n\n(iii) \n\nISO 4217 for currency codes, \n\n(iv) \n\nISO 6166 (International Securities Identification Number [ISIN]) for securities numbering, \n\n(v) \n\nISO 9362 (Business Identifier Code [BIC]) for financial institution identification, and \n\n(vi) \n\nISO 8601 for date and time. \n\n \n\nD. \n\n \n1. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1   Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, which follows ISO/IEC15408, is the basis for the \n\nevaluation of security properties of information technology products. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nNext Steps for ASEAN+3 Central Securities Depository and Real-Time Gross Settlement Linkages  \n\nDescriptions of these individual standards are provided below. \n\nISO 20022 for messages \n\nimplementation easier: \n\nUpon discussing the key ISO 20022 messages, the following basic concepts may be adopted to make \n\n(a)  Mandatory items in ISO 20022 message definition reports are also to be mandatory for CSD\u2013\n\n(b)  Optional message items that may be used for cross-border connections are also to be \n\n(c) \n\nIt does not necessarily mean that message items to be used only for specific bilateral linkages \n\n(d) \n\nISO 20022 message items that are already in use and/or to be used during implementation \n\nRTGS linkage messages.  \n\nstandardized to the extent possible. \n\nor domestic purposes are prohibited. \n\nneed to be honored. \n\nISO 3166 for country codes \n\nISO 3166 is the international standard for country codes and their subdivisions.

Security: To prevent information leakage, tampering, and/or repudiation, messages \n\nincluding information sent through the network should be encrypted and marked with a \n\ndigital signature. \n\nii.  Reliability: To ensure the reliability of connections between CSD and RTGS systems, \n\nmessage sequencing, retransmission, and idempotency should be adopted. \n\n(b)  Duplication of platform of gateway to back up each other (redundancy). \n\ni.  Availability: To enhance the availability of gateways, active\u2013active or active\u2013standby \n\nconfigurations for gateways should be adopted. \n\n(ii)  Implementing measures to avoid negative impacts, such as failures from counterparty, are as \n\nfollows:  \n\n(a)  Individual message instructions are to be processed item by item (message-oriented). \n\n(b)  Appropriate measures to prevent negative impacts from counterparties need to be \n\nimplemented. Criteria for choosing network providers need to be specified. \n\n(iii)  Securing interoperability when connecting FMIs in ASEAN+3 bilaterally includes \n\n(a)  adopting international standards for technical specifications to connect CSD and RTGS \n\nsystems within the region, and \n\n(b)  implementing the specifications with expandability and flexibility to enable gradual \n\nparticipation in the linkages by the FMIs ready to be connected with each other. \n\n(iv)  Functions converting ISO 20022 (ASEAN+3) with ISO 20022 (local standard of each economy) \n\nare as follows: \n\n(a)  Mandatory message items of ISO 20022 are to be accepted as mandatory message items \n\nwith the same definition in all ASEAN+3 economies.  \n\n(b)  Optional message items of ISO 20022 for a local economy may be different from those of \n\nanother economy and/or the ASEAN+3 standard, but they need to be standardized as \n\nreasonably as possible. \n\n(c)  Not only message items but also message flows may differ by economy and need to be \n\nharmonized as reasonably as possible to absorb differences between the gateways. \n\n(v)  Message identification (reference) that can uniquely identify each message for CSD\u2013RTGS \n\nlinkage end-to-end, even for messages transferred across the economy. An application-based, \n\nbilateral, unique, and sequential reference number (temporally named CSD\u2013RTGS interlinking \n\nreference) may be introduced.  \n\n \n\n\f12  Next Steps for ASEAN+3 Central Securities Depository and Real-Time Gross Settlement Linkages  \n\nB)  Possible technical specifications \n\n2020 will be adopted.  \n\nTechnologies and products that are available or will be available in all ASEAN+3 economies in or around \n\nIn order to share a common image of the gateway, possible functions include the following: \n\n(i)  Communication protocol: \n\n(a)  With respect to the standard communication protocol for CSD\u2013RTGS linkages, Transmission \n\nControl Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is to be adopted since TCP/IP is already the \n\nstandard communication protocol in ASEAN+3 as well as being adopted by all FMIs in the \n\nregion. \n\nto be adopted.5  \n\n(b)  With respect to the communication interface, a loosely connecting interface such as SOAP is \n\n(ii)  Message format: XML, which is already widely accepted, is to be used. With respect to message \n\ntypes, ISO 20022 compatible messages are to be used in principle.  \n\n(iii)  Character code set: Unicode (UTF-8) is to be used as the character code set. \n\n \nC) \n\nInteroperability by adopting international standards \n\nThe international standards mentioned above should be adopted.  \n\n \nD)  Cross-border network connecting CSD and RTGS systems \n\nGateways for CSD\u2013RTGS linkages are to be connected to each other bilaterally by commonly used \n\ntechnological measures such as an internet protocol virtual private network. Network providers that are \n\nwidely used by CSDs and central banks may be adopted as part of the network infrastructure (Figure 5). \n\nBasic requirements for network providers of CSD-RTGS linkages are shown in Appendix 2. \n\n \nE)  Cross-border BCP and cybersecurity \n\nGiven the importance of sound and resilient linkages among regional CSD and RTGS operators, it is \n\nimportant that CSIF members maintain the smooth operation of critical business functions and the \n\nresiliency of CSD and RTGS systems against potential cyber risks. Gateways for CSD\u2013RTGS linkages \n\nneed to satisfy the recommendations specified by the CSIF.6  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5   Simple object access protocol, or SOAP, has a high level of conformity with XML. \n6   Asian  Development  Bank.  2018.

PROGRESS OF CENTRAL SECURITIES \nDEPOSITORY\u2013REAL-TIME GROSS \nSETTLEMENT LINKAGE MODELS TO DATE \n\nA. \n\nPotential Benefits of Central Securities Depository\u2013Real-Time Gross \n\nSettlement Linkages \n\nCSD\u2013RTGS linkages will connect CSD systems operated by national CSDs and RTGS systems operated \n\nby central banks. The linkages allow local currency (LCY) bonds to be settled DVP via central bank money, \n\nwhich ensures the safety of settlement, even in cross-border transactions. Cross-border DVP via CSD\u2013\n\nRTGS linkages is compliant with international standards including the Principles for Financial Market \n\nInfrastructures of the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures. In addition, the linkages will \n\nsupport further cross-border banking and financial integration in ASEAN+3. The ASEAN Economic \n\nCommunity  Blueprint 2025 notes that inclusive and stable financial sector development is a key goal of \n\nregional economic integration.7 As a strategic measure, greater market access and operational flexibility for \n\nQualified ASEAN Banks through the ASEAN Banking Integration Framework should be considered. The \n\nexpected benefits of CSD\u2013RTGS linkages are discussed below. \n\n1.  Enhancing the financial stability of ASEAN+3 \n\nCSD\u2013RTGS linkages can not only reduce cross-border transaction costs but also support risk \n\nmitigation by enabling cross-currency DVP and mobilizing LCY government bonds as cross-border \n\ncollateral. Due to tighter regulations enacted after the global financial crisis, demand for high-quality \n\nliquid assets (HQLA) has increased. For cross-border transactions, normally only United States (US) \n\ndollars and US Treasury bonds are accepted as HQLA collateral. However, when Asian markets face \n\nstress, availability of these may be limited because the US market is not open. Thus, intraregional \n\nfinancial transactions may need to be supported by HQLA within ASEAN+3 markets. CSD\u2013RTGS \n\nlinkages will support not only trading of LCY government bonds in the region but also utilization of the \n\nregion\u2019s HQLA, hence, alleviating concerns of collateral shortage.  \n\n7   ASEAN Secretariat. 2015. ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint 2025. Jakarta.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fProgress of Central Securities Depository\u2013Real-Time Gross Settlement Linkage Models to Date  15 \n\n \n2.  Meeting increasing demands for local currency settlement  \n\nCross-border cash payments and remittances are supported by a correspondent banking network \n\nbased on US dollars, which inevitably delays payments due to the time difference between markets in \n\nAsia and the US market. A remittance between markets in two ASEAN+3 economies will be \n\ntransferred to the correspondent US banks, settled through the US dollar payment network, and \n\ntransferred back to Asia\u2014a process that normally takes 2 days (T+2). Along with increasing \n\nintraregional trade volume, LCY transactions can potentially be settled more quickly or even the same \n\nday. Multicurrency cash management may be necessary because barriers between LCY markets in \n\nASEAN+3 economies will persist for some time. In such circumstances, CSD\u2013RTGS linkages, which \n\ndirectly connect central bank RTGS systems, would help support efficient and spontaneous cash \n\ndelivery between ASEAN+3 markets.  \n\nThere are some leading cases of CSD\u2013RTGS linkages in the region. The following sections will explain \n\nthe notable features of (i) cross-border DVP between the Bank of Japan and the Hong Kong Monetary \n\nAuthority\u2019s (HKMA); (ii) Bond Connect as a CSD\u2013CSD linkage between China Central Depository & \n\nClearing Co., Ltd. (CCDC) and Shanghai Clearing House (SHCH) in the PRC and the HKMA; and \n\n(ii) PVP linkages between the HKMA and markets in some ASEAN economies. The CSIF discussions \n\nhave focused on how these leading cases can provide a basis to expand standardized messages and \n\npractices in the region. Thus, the reference flows shown in Figures 7, 9, and 11 will be reviewed and \n\nrevised along with the changes in the technological environment and transactions in the region. \n\n \nCross-Border Delivery Versus Payment Linkages \n\nB. \n\n \n\nThe Bank of Japan and the HKMA are developing cross-border DVP links by connecting the Bank of \n\nJapan Financial Network System Japanese Government Bond services with the Hong Kong Dollar \n\nClearing House Automated Transfer System, known as Hong Kong dollar CHATS, which is the RTGS for \n\nHong Kong dollars. The link, which will enable DVP settlement of Japanese Government Bonds and \n\nHong Kong dollars, will go live in spring 2021. Cross-border DVP will eliminate settlement risk arising from \n\ndifferences in time zones and jurisdictions and will facilitate cross-currency repurchase agreements \n\n(repo). Figure 6 illustrates how financial institution A can transfer Japanese Government Bonds to \n\nfinancial institution B in return for simultaneous Hong Kong dollar funding from financial institution B to A.  \n\nFigure 7 shows the outline of CSD\u2013RTGS Linkages for Cross-Currency Delivery Versus Payment \n\npublished in the progress report in 2015. \n\nThe harmonization of message flows would be necessary to expand cross-border DVP linkages in the region. \n\nAmong the message items, transaction identifications are needed to ensure smooth cross-border settlement \n\nbetween CSD and RTGS. In addition, the sending date and operating hours need to be harmonized. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16  Next Steps for ASEAN+3 Central Securities Depository and Real-Time Gross Settlement Linkages  \n\nFigure 6: Cross-Border Delivery Versus Payment \n \n\n(Bank of Japan)\n\nBOJ-NET JGB Services\n\nFinancial\nInstitution A\n\nJGB\n\nFinancial\nInstitution B\n\nJapan\n\nHong Kong, China\n\nLink\n\nDVP\n\n(Hong Kong Monetary Authority)\n\nHKD CHATS\n\nFinancial\nInstitution A\n\n$\n\nHKD\n\nFinancial\nInstitution B\n\nDVP settlement\nby linking the two systems\n\n \nBOJ  =  Bank  of  Japan,  BOJ-NET  =  Bank  of  Japan  Financial  Network  System,  CHATS  =  Clearing  House Automated  Transfer \nSystem, DVP = delivery versus payment, HKD = Hong Kong dollar, JGB = Japanese Government Bond. \n \nSource: Bank of Japan. 2018.

PROGRESS OF STANDARDIZATION \n\nIN ASEAN+3 \n\nMajor financial markets, including in Europe and the US, have announced the adoption of ISO 20022 for \n\nmajor FMIs. The Eurosystem\u2019s Vision 2020 promotes ISO 20022. In 2014, the Federal Reserve and the \n\nClearing House announced their intention to adopt ISO 20022 in payment messages for Fedwire and the \n\nClearing House Interbank Payments System. The PRC, India, Japan, and the Russian Federation have \n\nalready implemented ISO 20022 in their FMIs. Thanks to the efforts of CSIF members, ASEAN+3 \n\neconomies are now ready to implement the international standard. CSD and RTGS system operators in \n\nthe region are supporting their participants\u2019 migration to ISO 20022. The related discussions focus more \n\non how to maximize the expandability of data exchanges under ISO 20022.  \n\n \n\nA. \n\nSystems in ASEAN+3  \n\nOutline of Central Securities Depository and Real-Time Gross Settlement \n\nCSD systems for government bonds are already operating in all ASEAN+3 economies except Cambodia \n\nand the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), where book-entry systems for government bonds \n\nare under planning and development. CSD systems for corporate bonds are already operating in all \n\nASEAN+3 economies except the Lao PDR and Myanmar. In the case of Cambodia, a few corporate \n\nbonds have already been issued and can be traded in the exchange market. Having said that, an \n\nappropriate CSD system for corporate bonds which can settle bonds with DVP model 1 has not been \n\nimplemented yet. RTGS systems are already operating in all ASEAN+3 economies.10 Government bonds \n\nare settled using central bank money. Both government bonds and corporate bonds are traded mostly in \n\nover-the-counter (OTC) markets in ASEAN+3 economies. Significant volumes of government bonds are \n\ntraded on exchanges in the Republic of Korea and the Philippines, though the majority of trading volume \n\noccurs in OTC markets (Figures 12, 13). \n\n10   RTGS system in Cambodia will be live by the time this progress report is published. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22  Next Steps for ASEAN+3 Central Securities Depository and Real-Time Gross

ASEAN+3 Information on Transaction Flows and Settlement Infrastructures. \nManila. \n \nC. \n\nRemaining Challenges for More Standardized Markets  \n\nThe CSIF conducted a survey on the features and functions of cross-border connections such as \n\nadoption of XML, DVP model including real-time function, blocking securities, matching, operating hours, \n\nand BCP. To fully implement CSD\u2013RTGS linkages in the region, it is necessary to make further efforts \n\nwith regard to the following features. \n\n1. \n\nISO 20022 (XML) \n\nXML is a technology (language) used to specify ISO 20022. With respect to government bond CSD \n\nsystems, three economies (Brunei Darussalam, the PRC, and Japan) have already implemented \n\nXML. All other economies in ASEAN+3 will be able to implement this technology by or around 2023. \n\n \n\n\f26  Next Steps for ASEAN+3 Central Securities Depository and Real-Time Gross Settlement Linkages  \n\n \nRegarding corporate bond CSD systems, three economies (the PRC, Japan, and Singapore) have \n\nalready implemented this feature. All other economies in ASEAN+3 will hopefully have implemented \n\nXML for a corporate bond CSD system by or around 2023.  \n\nThose economies in the region with the least developed bond markets\u2014including Cambodia, the Lao \n\nPDR, and Myanmar\u2014are expected to catch up with the others by implementing the necessary FMI. \n\n \n\n2.  DVP model 1 with RTGS function \n\nFor government bond markets, 12 economies (Brunei Darussalam; the PRC; Hong Kong, China; \n\nIndonesia; Japan; the Republic of Korea; Myanmar; Malaysia; the Philippines; Singapore; Thailand; \n\nand Viet Nam) have already been operating DVP model 1 with RTGS function. The Lao PDR is \n\ndeveloping CSD systems with DVP model 1, while Cambodia is planning to develop a CSD system \n\nwith DVP model 1.  \n\nRegarding corporate bond markets, nine economies (the PRC; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Japan; \n\nthe Republic of Korea; Malaysia; the Philippines; Singapore; and Thailand) are operating DVP model \n\n1 with RTGS function. Five economies (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, and \n\nViet Nam) are planning to develop CSD systems with DVP model 1. \n\nReal-time processing is a very important issue for high-value payment and settlement systems \n\n(HVPS). Compared with Europe and the US, some economies in ASEAN+3 have higher real-time \n\nprocessing capability, such as notifying settlement results including debit and credit as well as the \n\nbalance of accounts immediately after the settlement. To follow best practices in the region, it is \n\nadvisable that the customer debit\u2013credit notification (i.e., camt.054 under ISO) include the balance \n\ninformation on a real-time basis to notify both the debit and credit side immediately. A possible \n\nchange request for camt.054 is shown in Appendix 3 for future discussion. \n\n \n\n3.  Blocking securities \n\nFor government bond markets, 10 economies (Brunei Darussalam; the PRC; Hong Kong, China; \n\nIndonesia; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; the Philippines; Singapore; Thailand; and Viet Nam) \n\nhave already implemented blocking securities for DVP settlement, whereas the CSD systems in two \n\neconomies (Japan and Myanmar) do not have such a function. However, Japan is developing this \n\nfeature. Meanwhile, two economies (Cambodia and the Lao PDR) need to develop their respective \n\nCSD systems. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fProgress of Standardization in ASEAN+3  27 \n\nRegarding corporate bonds, 10 economies (the PRC; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Japan; the \n\nRepublic of Korea; Malaysia; the Philippines; Singapore; Thailand; and Viet Nam) have already \n\nimplemented a block securities function. Four economies (Brunei Darussalam; Cambodia; the Lao \n\nPDR; and Myanmar) are required to develop a CSD system with a block securities function for each \n\neconomy to implement the cross-border DVP. \n\n4.  Matching  \n\nFor government bond markets, 11 economies (Brunei Darussalam; the PRC; Hong Kong, China; \n\nIndonesia; Japan; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; the Philippines; Singapore; Thailand; and Viet \n\nNam) have adopted central matching, which confirms both the sell and buy sides\u2019 intention to settle. \n\nRegarding corporate bond markets, most CSD systems operating in the region have adopted central \n\nmatching, except for Brunei Darussalam. \n\n5.  Operating hours \n\nRegarding operating hours, including cut-off times for the business operation of cross-currency DVP, \n\nall ASEAN+3 members have indicated that their RTGS and CSD systems have sufficiently \n\noverlapping operating hours. However, there are differences in individual markets\u2019 schedules such as \n\nthe start time of DVP processing, cut-off times for different events, and the end of DVP processing \n\neach day. Therefore, operating hours for cross-currency DVP should be decided bilaterally. Also, \n\nwhen actual linkages involve more than two economies, operating hours should be discussed among \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nASEAN+3 members. \n\n6.  Business continuity planning \n\nContingency measures based on those outlined in Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures \n\nhave, in principle, been accepted by all ASEAN+3 member economies. When actual linkages are \n\nestablished, more detailed contingency measures need to be determined. Therefore, BCP issues \n\nalso need to be revisited after actual linkages have been established so that market participants \n\nagree upon the standard or minimum measures to be implemented. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nV.  EMERGING TRENDS IN \n\nCROSS-BORDER TRANSACTIONS \n\nA. \n\nCross-Border Collateral \n\nAs economic and financial linkages within ASEAN+3 are increasing, collateral demands for cross-border \n\ntransactions and the need for LCY liquidity will increase. Therefore, CSIF members studied and \n\ndiscussed the possibility of using collateral in one economy to obtain liquidity in another, which is referred \n\nto as cross-border collateral. \n\n \n1.  Cross-border use of collateral in the Eurosystem \n\nCross-border collateral transactions are commonly used in the euro area.11 A bank in country A can \n\nget local liquidity from the central bank in country A (home central bank) or another bank in country A \n\nby pledging bonds in country C through the correspondent central banking model. This model not \n\nonly facilitates access to liquidity for banks that are operating across the euro area, but it also \n\nincreases liquidity in the government bond market (Figure 14). \n\nFigure 14: Correspondent Central Banking Model in Europe \n\nCountry B\n\nCountry C\n\nCountry A\n\nHome Central\nBank (HCB)\n\nRelease\nof credit\nvia\nTARGET 2\n(5)\n\nMobilisation\nInstruction\n(1)\n\nConfirmation (4)\n(CCBM message)\n\nMobilisation\ninstruction (2)\n(CCBM message)\n\nMaching (3)\n\nCorrespondent\nCentral Bank (CCB)\n\nCounterparty\n\nCustodian\n\nDelivery instruction (1)\n\nConfirmation (4)\n\nDelivery\ninstruction (1)\n\nSettlement\nconfirmation (3)\n\nSettlement\nconfirmation (3)\n\nEligible\nlink\n\nCSD B\n\nCSD C\n\n \n\nCCB = correspondent central bank; CSD = central securities depository, CCBM = correspondent central banking model, HCB = \nhome central bank. \n \nSource: Deutsche Bundesbank. \n\n11   Bank for International Settlements. 2006.

First, HVPS or RTGS systems in the euro area \n\nwere connected with each other via the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement \n\nExpress Transfer System (TARGET) Interlinking System. Then, the TARGET Interlinking System was \n\nconsolidated into a single shared platform called TARGET 2. For securities settlement, TARGET 2 \n\nSecurities was developed with the auto-collateralization mechanism. Furthermore, an initiative to \n\nconsolidate TARGET 2 and TARGET 2 Securities into a single platform is underway (Figure 15). Such \n\nenhancements of payment and settlement infrastructures is expected to contribute to the further \n\ndevelopment of financial markets in Europe.  \n\nFigure 15: Eurosystem Collateral Management System as Part of Vision 2020 \n \nGo-live of ECMS is planned for November 2022\n\nProvision of\nEuro central bank mon ey\n\nManagement of credit lines\nSettlement of MRO, LTRO, etc.\n\nSupport of\nauto-collateralization\n\nSettlement of securities\nas collateral\n\nEurosystem\nCollateral\nManagement\nSystem (ECMS)\n\n \nECMS = Eurosystem Collateral Management System, MRO = main refinancing operation, LTRO = longer-term refinancing \noperation. \n \nSource: Deutsche Bundesbank. \n\n \n\n2.

Regional collateral pool \n\nEmerging Trends in Cross-Border Transactions  31 \n\nThe Asian Prime Collateral Forum shared its proposal to expand the eligibility of central bank \n\ncollateral within ASEAN+3. As a general practice, a central bank\u2019s collateral is restricted to domestic \n\nassets such as the government bonds under its jurisdiction. If central banks in the region agreed to \n\nexpand eligibility to include the government and other qualified bonds of ASEAN+3 member \n\neconomies, whether via bilateral or multilateral collateral arrangements, it would increase cross-\n\nborder bond transactions, thereby improving market liquidity and enhancing financial stability in \n\nASEAN+3 markets. \n\n \n\nIn October 2019, the Asian Prime Collateral Forum jointly organized a session at the 19th CSIF \n\nMeeting to discuss the respective collateral frameworks of ASEAN+3 central banks and to explore the \n\npossible expansion of the collateral pool for cross-border transactions. More than 100 people, \n\nincluding researchers and government officials in the region, participated in the session and shared \n\ntheir ideas of expanding the collateral pool in ASEAN+3. The discussions enhanced participants\u2019 \n\nunderstanding of the segmented collateral and repo markets in the region, allowing them to envision \n\na practical roadmap toward more harmonized transactions. Expanding cross-border collateral \n\narrangements among the region\u2019s central banks, together with currency swaps, will help ASEAN+3 \n\nprotect itself against external shocks and secure the momentum needed to develop the region\u2019s LCY \n\nbond markets.  \n\n \n\nB. \n\nDistributed Ledger Technology \n\nCentral  banks  in  the  world  are  conducting  various  studies,  experiments,  and  assessments  of  new \n\ntechnologies such as distributed ledger technology (DLT) and blockchain. Some central banks in ASEAN+3 \n\nhave made steps to implement such technologies into their payment and settlement applications.  \n\n \n1.  DLT Scripless Bond in Thailand \n\nThe Bank of Thailand and the Thailand Securities Depository have launched an initiative, known as \n\nDLT Scripless Bond, that adopts DLT and blockchain. The main purpose of the project is to reduce \n\nthe time from issuance to subsequent settlement of Thai retail government bonds from 15 days to 2 \n\ndays (T+2). Along with the Bank of Thailand and the Thailand Securities Depository, major Thai \n\nbanks are also participating in the project. In the system, the selling agent keeps a record of their own \n\ncustomers as distributed ledgers, while the Bank of Thailand and the Thailand Securities Depository \n\nkeep the master ledger. The process of securities account opening is conducted automatically with \n\nsmart contracts, and all transactions are time-stamped and lodged in ledgers retained by authorized \n\nparticipants. Thanks to blockchain technology, the recorded information will be immutable (Figure 18). \n\n \n\n\f32  Next Steps for ASEAN+3 Central Securities Depository and Real-Time Gross Settlement Linkages  \n\nFigure 18: Distributed Ledger Technology Scripless Bond \n \n \n\nRegistrar\n\nBOT\n\nIBM\n\nTechnology partner\n\nBANKs\n\nPDMO\n\nSelling agents\n\nBond issuer\n\nTSD\n\n \n \nBOT = Bank of Thailand, PDMO = public debt management office, TSD = Thailand Securities Depository Co., Ltd.  \n \nSource: Bank of Thailand. 2018.

The Bakong System in Cambodia \n\nThe Bakong System is a blockchain-based payment service supported by National Bank of \n\nCambodia. It can provide a peer-to-peer fund transfer service to retail customers of participating \n\nbanks in Cambodia.

FUTURE CHALLENGES \nAND NEXT STEPS \n\nA. \n\nFuture Challenges \n\nEstablishing an RSI is an effective way to stimulate intraregional financial investments. The CSIF has \n\nmade concerted efforts toward establishing secure, stable, and efficient cross-border funds and securities \n\nsettlement infrastructure through CSD\u2013RTGS linkages. The CSIF publications on this subject are the \n\noutcome of such efforts. Since the level of market developments among ASEAN+3 economies is diverse, \n\nit is necessary to consider measures to support market development in the region\u2019s less-developed \n\neconomies. Proposed measures should provide guidance on supporting market development and \n\nfurthering market integration to maximize the benefits of regional cooperation. To successfully implement \n\nan RSI, the following issues require further attention from CSIF members.  \n\n \n\n1.  Cross-border business continuity planning and cybersecurity \n\nWhile the CSIF has already published the Common Understanding on Cross-Border Business \n\nContinuity Planning and Cybersecurity, it is necessary to continuously review these important issues. \n\nThe process of information sharing and discussion among CSIF members will help crystalize the \n\nregion\u2019s expectation for BCP, cybersecurity standards, system security, and system resiliency. The \n\nexchange of information and communication will establish the basis of mutual assurance and \n\nrecognition needed for systems to be linked in the future.  \n\n2.  Expansion of data exchanges through financial market infrastructure \n\nThanks to the efforts of CSIF members, all ASEAN+3 markets will soon implement ISO 20022. To \n\nmaximize the benefits of ISO 20022, the expansion of data fields for cross-border messaging and the \n\npossible benefits of data exchanges through market infrastructure should be considered. For \n\nexample, the European Securities and Markets Authority, the European Union's securities markets \n\nregulator, sets ISO 20022 XML schemas to be used for reporting under the Securities Financing \n\nTransactions Regulation. Likewise, regulators in ASEAN+3 can consider a standardized regulatory \n\nreporting format to maximize the use of XML. Thanks to the use of XML in ISO 20022, Asian local \n\n \n\n \n\n\fFuture Challenges and Next Steps  35 \n\n \n\nlanguage characters may be accommodated in the future. Currently, cross-border messages are only \n\nalphanumeric. To improve know-your-customer processes, ensure anti-money laundering, and \n\ncombat the financing of terrorism, it is desirable to accept local language characters in the \n\nidentification of counterparties and monitoring of financial transactions. Such regional efforts should \n\nbe incorporated into global standards and practices. These issues can be discussed within the \n\nASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum. \n\n3.  Rapid technological advancement  \n\nRecent technological advancements are supporting the region\u2019s market development. Less- \n\ndeveloped markets can more easily catch up with or even surpass developed markets because of \n\nsuch rapid advances. The cost of servers has been slashed, and affordable cloud sourcing has made \n\neasier the setting up of backup facilities. The expansion of mobile technology is supporting access to \n\ninformation, the digitalization of financial transactions, and the personalization of information that can \n\nsupport faster and more robust identification. The use of QR codes is proliferating in the region, and \n\nfaster and instantaneous payments are now more widely available in different markets. In addition, \n\nthe border of wholesale and retail payments is blurring as some central banks are supporting such \n\npayments through the central bank system. The existing cross-border banking network based on \n\ncorrespondent agreements between banks is facing challenges as new technologies support the \n\nestablishment of secured and traceable cross-border payment networks. Given the heightened risk of \n\ncybersecurity, an existing framework of network security can quickly become obsolete. In previous \n\nCSIF discussions, it was assumed that further development of CSD\u2013RTGS linkages between all \n\nmembers would require a centralized unit to facilitate smooth cross-border data exchanges and \n\ntransactions. However, it is not clear such an assumption still holds. In the current technological \n\nenvironment, the most suitable system architecture for the region needs to take such advancements \n\ninto account. Therefore, the CSIF may need to conduct more research on available technologies such \n\nas DLT, blockchain, and tokenization. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.  Linkages between securities and cash payment system   \n\nAs described in previous sections, CSD\u2013RTGS linkages will support not only securities settlement but \n\nalso cross-border PVP. Given the increase in intraregional transactions amid remaining frictions in \n\ncross-border currency transactions, it is necessary to consider how CSD\u2013RTGS linkages can support \n\ncross-currency liquidity provision. Without an actual cash fund transfer, the pledging of high-quality \n\nliquid local currency assets could supplement and support local currency payments. Since most \n\nASEAN+3 markets operate in either the same (or an adjacent) time zone, regional CSD\u2013RTGS \n\nlinkages would create additional market liquidity. \n\n \n\n\f36  Next Steps for ASEAN+3 Central Securities Depository and Real-Time Gross Settlement Linkages  \n\nB. \n\nNext Steps \n\nRapidly proliferating disruptive technologies such as DLT, blockchain, crypto-asset, and tokenization \n\ncould substantially influence the future technical architecture of payment and settlement systems in the \n\nregion, including CSD\u2013RTGS linkages. Therefore, the CSIF should study the possible impacts of such \n\ntechnologies thoroughly. Some central banks in the region have already announced the extensive study \n\nand assessment of central bank digital currencies, while other central banks in the region have already \n\nimplemented such technologies. Given the uncertainty surrounding certain new technologies, further \n\nstudies and analyses are needed. As some economies in ASEAN+3 are more advanced in the utilization \n\nof such technologies, important leading cases can be observed. By exchanging information among CSIF \n\nmembers, knowledge and experiences can be shared. Given the possible impact on cross-border \n\npayment and settlement systems, the CSIF may need to consider further technical specifications and \n\noperational implementation of CSD\u2013RTGS linkages in the evolving technological environment.  \n\nTo create more concrete opportunities for cross-border transactions, the collateral usage of government \n\nbonds for LCY-to-LCY cross-border transactions and liquidity management needs to be discussed and \n\nstudied continuously and in depth. Enriched regional collateral pools for cross-border monetary \n\ntransactions are another important component of the regional safety net.  \n\nThe cross-border DVP linkage between the Bank of Japan and the HKMA, which is expected to go live in \n\nspring 2021, is a leading example and an important benchmark case for further implementation in other \n\njurisdictions across the region. Therefore, the CSIF should support the successful launching of this and \n\nother similar initiatives involving members of ASEAN+3. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \nAppendix 1: Members, Observers, and Secretariat including Liaison Persons \n\n \n1.

Purpose of the change: \n\nRecently, RTGS is commonly used as the way to settle interbank transactions in particular for HVPS. In \n\nsuch a case, it is important to inform the latest balance as the result of the settlement from account \n\nservicer to account owners or parties authorized by the account owners both on credit and debit sides.   \n\nSome central banks in ASEAN+3 notify balances of current accounts to the participants of RTGS systems \n\nimmediately after the settlement of each instruction. As such, it is an important request to solve already \n\nthe existing challenges. \n\n\uf0d8 \n\nIn some cases, proprietary message types (and/or items) are used because appropriate credit \n\nand debit notification messages in ISO 20022 is not available, yet. \n\nGenerally, camt.054 can be used to inform the result of the settlement for HVPS both for the debit side \n\nand credit side. For this purpose, balance information is to be added to the camt.054, in order for the \n\naccount servicer to inform the latest balance to account owners or parties authorized by the account \n\nowners both for the debit side and credit side in a real-time basis.  \n\nE.  Urgency of the request: \n\nIt is proposed to include this change request in the next regular maintenance cycle.  \n\nF.  Business examples: \n\nAn example of HVPS for funds transfers using the central bank RTGS system is shown below. Timely \n\ninformation about the latest balance is important not only for liquidity management of participants \n\n(financial institutions) but also for risk management perspective. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52  Appendix 3 \n\nReal-time funds transfer from participant  A to participant B\nthrough a Central Bank (financial market infrastructure) RTGS system\n\npacs.008 or pacs.009\n\n1\n\npacs.002\n\ncamt.054\n\n2\n\n4\n\npacs.008 or pacs.009\n\n3\n\n4\n\ncamt.054\n\nCentral Bank\n(RTGS system)\n\nParticipant B\n\n \n\n \n\nParticipant A\n\n \n\n \n\nG.

The proposed RSI is to be based on bilateral links \nbetween national central securities depositories and central banks\u2019 real-time gross settlement systems. \nThis\u00a0model can realize cross-border delivery versus payment settlement to enable safe and efficient \ncross-border financial transactions. The report also highlights emerging trends and challenges in\u00a0cross-border \nfinancial transactions and sets out next steps in establishing an RSI.\n\nAbout the Cross-Border Settlement Infrastructure Forum\n\nThe Cross-Border Settlement Infrastructure Forum is composed of the central banks and central securities \ndepositories of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Japan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, and the \nRepublic of Korea\u2014known collectively as ASEAN+3. The CSIF is mandated to facilitate discussions to improve \ncross-border bond and cash settlement infrastructure in the ASEAN+3 region, including the possibility of \nestablishing a regional settlement intermediary. The Asian Development Bank acts as secretariat to the CSIF.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific,  \nwhile sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 68 members  \n\u201449 from the region.
