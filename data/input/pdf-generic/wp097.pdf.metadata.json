This paper argues that inclusive growth \nemphasizes creation of and equal access to opportunities; and that unequal \nopportunities arise from social exclusion associated with market, institutional, and \npolicy failures. A development strategy anchored on inclusive growth is outlined, \nconsisting of two mutually reinforcing strategic pillars of high and sustainable \ngrowth to create economic opportunities, and social inclusion to ensure equal \naccess to opportunities. This will enable developing Asia to accomplish the agenda \nof eradicating extreme poverty and, at the same time, address the development \nchallenge brought about by rising inequalities. It is argued that the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) should respond to the emerging needs of developing \nAsia by adopting inclusive growth as its overarching goal. This goal, if adopted, \nwill require ADB to modify its corporate strategy, including its vision, mission, \nstrategic pillars, and core operational priorities. Implications for ADB\u2019s country \nand regional operations are discussed. ", "", "I.  INtRoDuCtIoN\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s stellar gross domestic product (\ufffdDP) growth rates have masked rapidly \nrising relative and absolute inequalities, leading to two faces of Asia. A \u201cshining Asia\u201d, which is \ncompeting internationally and benefiting from the forces of globalization, technological change, \nand economies of scale, has grabbed the attention of the media and the world. In contrast, a \n\u201csuffering Asia\u201d, not as well publicized but even more important, has unacceptably wide swatches \nof its population who are poor and vulnerable. These two faces of Asia are both a beacon of hope \nand a symbol of despair. Merging these two faces will be the development challenge over the next \ngeneration for the region.\nIn addressing this challenge, inclusive growth with its focus on creating economic opportunities \nand ensuring equal access to them will play a pivotal role. More and more countries are adopting \nit as the goal of development policy. India, which had poverty reduction as the central focus of its \ndevelopment strategy over the last 50 years, has recently switched to a new strategy focusing on \ntwo objectives\ufffd\ufffd raising economic growth and making growth more inclusive (Planning Commission \nof India 2006). In the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the government has made the creation of \na \u201charmonious society\u201d, a concept very closely related to inclusive growth, as the top priority in \nits 11th Five Year Plan (State Council of China 2006). In Thailand, growth with equity is one of \nthe elements of its \u201cSufficiency Philosophy\u201d, which underpins the government\u2019s development efforts \n(UNDP 2007). A similar theme can be found in \ufffdiet Nam\u2019s socioeconomic development strategy, which \nadvocates \u201cquick and sustainable development, economic growth in parallel with implementation \nof initiatives, social equity, and environment protection\u201d (The Central Committee of the Communist \nParty of \ufffdiet Nam 2001). Inclusive growth as a development concept is also being embraced by \nmany development partners of developing countries including bilateral and multilateral aid agencies, \ninternational organizations, nongovernment organizations, and civil society.\nIn the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \u201ccontributing to the harmonious growth of the region\u201d \nis mandated by its Charter (ADB 1966). The importance of \u201cinclusive growth\u201d and \u201cinclusiveness\u201d \nhas been recognized in many of its strategic documents. For instance, \u201cinclusive social development\u201d \nis one of the strategic pillars of the Enhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) (ADB 2004b). \n\u201cStrengthening inclusiveness\u201d is one of the strategic priorities of the Medium-Term Strategy II \n2006\u20132008 (ADB 2006c). More recently, a panel of eminent persons commissioned by ADB\u2019s President \nto provide insights on the region\u2019s future and on how it will affect the future role of ADB, called \non the institution to expand its strategic role from poverty reduction to inclusive growth (ADB \n2007b).\nThis paper examines policy implications of adopting inclusive growth as the overarching \ndevelopment goal for developing Asia and for ADB. More specifically, the paper (i) looks at why \ndeveloping Asia is embracing inclusive growth; (ii) discusses the concept of inclusive growth as a \ndevelopment goal; (iii) examines policy ingredients of a development strategy anchored on inclusive \ngrowth; and (iv) examines implications for ADB if it is to adopt inclusive growth as its overarching \ngoal.", "InclusIve Growth toward a ProsPerous asIa: PolIcy ImPlIcatIons\nIfzal alI and JuzhonG zhuanG\nII.  Why Is DEvEloPINg AsIA EmbRACINg INClusIvE gRoWth?\nThe attention to and recognition of the relevance and importance of inclusive growth in \ndeveloping Asia have been triggered by a rising concern that the benefits of spectacular economic \ngrowth have not been equitably shared (Ali 2007). This section explains why many countries of \ndeveloping Asia are embracing inclusive growth and putting it at the heart of their development \npolicy and strategy.\nDeveloping Asia experienced rapid economic growth during the last two decades. For developing \nAsia as a whole, per capita \ufffdDP at 2000 constant prices increased from $424 to $1,030 between \n1990 and 2005, growing at an annual rate of 6%, a pace with few parallels in history (Table 1). \nAcross the region, growth was most pronounced in East Asia at over 9%, driven largely by the PRC. \nSoutheast Asia grew at an annual rate of 3.2% despite interruptions marked by the 1997 financial \ncrisis. South Asia grew at 3.8% annually; this level of growth, although low, nevertheless represents \na significant improvement from its past, in particular, in view of the more recent acceleration in \ngrowth in several countries including India and Pakistan. \ntable 1\nIncome Per caPIta and Poverty IncIdence In asIa\nGdP Per caPIta, averaGe  headcount ratIo headcount ratIo\nconstant 2000 annual $1-a-day  $2-a-day\nus$ Growth rate (%) (%)\neconomy 1990 2005 (%) 1990 2005 chanGe 1990 2005 chanGe\nPRC 392 1449 9.11 32.50 7.10 \u201325.40 71.50 29.40 \u221242.10\nMongolia 451 483 0.47 27.30 10.51 \u221216.79 69.94 42.37 \u221227.57\n  East Asia 392 1447 9.10 32.50 7.10 \u221225.40 71.50 29.40 \u221242.10\nBangladesh 283 433 2.86 34.40 36.04 1.64 85.70 81.70 \u22124.00\nIndia 317 588 4.20 43.50 35.00 \u20138.50 86.50 79.80 \u22126.70\nNepal 176 234 1.93 45.70 26.02 \u221219.68 84.33 65.45 \u221218.88\nPakistan 461 596 1.72 47.76 10.24 \u201337.52 87.87 59.42 \u221228.45\nSri Lanka 577 1002 3.74 3.82 2.04 \u20131.78 40.58 32.85 \u22127.73\n  South Asia 330 573 3.75 42.40 31.90 \u201310.50 85.80 76.90 \u22128.90\nCambodia -- 402 32.50 12.67 \u201319.83 76.30 54.52 \u221221.78\nIndonesia 612 942 2.91 20.51 7.43 \u201313.08 70.92 50.31 \u221220.61\nLao PDR 228 396 3.75 52.74 21.35 \u201331.39 89.60 67.68 \u221221.92\nMalaysia 2547 4437 3.77 0.09 0.00 \u20130.09 23.38 9.77 \u221213.61\nPhilippines 914 1129 1.42 20.20 10.86 \u20139.34 55.48 40.29 \u221215.19\nThailand 1452 2441 3.52 10.16 0.00 \u201310.16 43.05 16.17 \u221226.88\n\ufffdiet Nam 227 538 5.93 50.66 6.48 \u201344.18 87.00 39.73 \u221247.27\n South East Asia 784 1256 3.19 23.80 7.20 \u201316.60 65.60 43.20 \u221222.40\nTotal Regions 424 1030 6.10 34.60 18.00 \u201316.60 75.00 51.90 \u221223.10\nNote\ufffd\ufffd  \ufffdeadcount ratio is poverty headcount ratio, at either $1-a-day or $2-a-day (percent of population).\n  Totals for regional groupings include only those countries listed.\nSources\ufffd\ufffd World Bank Povcalnet database and East Asia updates for 1990 poverty estimates; poverty projections for 2005 and 2020, \nstaff estimates; per capita \ufffdDP figures from World Development Indicators Online (World Bank 2007).\nAsia\u2019s rapid growth has led to dramatic reduction in the level of extreme poverty.

The income poverty target of the Millennium Development \ufffdoals (MD\ufffds) had been \nmet by 2005 for most Asian countries except those in South Asia. The decline in the number of \nthe extreme poor from 945 million in 1990 to 604 million in 2005 is largely attributable to the \nachievement in the PRC and \ufffdiet Nam. In South Asia, with the exception of Pakistan and Sri Lanka, \nthe incidence of extreme poverty and its magnitude in 2005 were still very significant.\n\ufffdowever, poverty incidence measured by $2-a-day is still very high. Using the $2-a-day poverty \nline,2 the level of poverty only declined from 75% to 51.9% between 1990 and 2005 for developing \nAsia as a whole (Table 1), suggesting that more than half of developing Asia still live in very poor \nconditions, are vulnerable to shocks, and may easily slip into extreme poverty. The decline in this \nmeasure of poverty between 1990 and 2005 was more pronounced in \ufffdiet Nam, PRC, Pakistan, and \nMongolia, and by 47.27, 42.1, 28.45, and 27.57 percentage points, respectively. The reduction in \nmost South Asian countries, however, was more limited.\nDespite rapid growth, developing Asia\u2019s income gap with the developed world remains astonishingly \nwide. In 2005, the average per capita \ufffdDP at 2000 constant dollar terms for developing Asia as a \nwhole was less than 3% that of Japan and the United States. Even for the PRC, which experienced \na 9% growth rate for more than 20 years, per capita \ufffdDP in 2005 was only 3.7% that of Japan and \n3.9% that of the United States (Figure 1). These suggest that developing Asia has a long way to  \ngo to catch up with the income level of the developed world. Even in terms of purchasing power \n2  The $2-a-day poverty line reflects poverty lines more commonly used in low-middle-income countries.\nFIGURE 1\nGDP PER CAPITA AS A PERCENT OF JAPAN\u2019S, 2005 (2000 CONSTANT US DOLLARS)\nNepal 1\nLao PDR 1\nCambodia 1\nBangladesh 1\nMongolia 1\nViet Nam 1\nIndia 2\nPakistan 2\nIndonesia 2\nSri Lanka 3\nPhilippines 3\nPRC 4\nThailand 6\nMalaysia 11\nUnited States 95\nJapan $39,075 100\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\nPercent\nSource: World Development Indicators Online (World Bank 2007).\n  erd workInG PaPer serIes no. 97  \u0018", "InclusIve Growth toward a ProsPerous asIa: PolIcy ImPlIcatIons\nIfzal alI and JuzhonG zhuanG\nparity, which is considered as more appropriate for cross-country comparisons, it would take 27 \nyears for the PRC, 40 years for Thailand, 48 years for \ufffdiet Nam, 51 years for India, and 84 years \nfor Bangladesh to catch up with Singapore\u2019s 2005 per capita \ufffdDP level under the benchmark growth \nrates (the average of the annual growth rates of \ufffdDP per capita between 2002 and 2006). Thus, \neven within Asia, there is a lot of catching-up left.\nA more pressing issue for developing Asia is rapidly rising inequalities leading to an increasing \nconcern that benefits of its spectacular growth have not been equally shared. Using the \ufffdini \ncoefficient, a commonly used measure of inequality, except for those severely hit by the Asian \nfinancial crisis (Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand) and Mongolia, income inequality has increased \nbetween 1990 and 2005 in all countries, with the largest jumps occurring in Bangladesh, Cambodia, \nPRC, Nepal, and Sri Lanka (see Table 2 and Figure 2). What is more disturbing is the increase in \nabsolute inequalities as measured by differences in mean consumption of the top quintile relative \nto the bottom quintile. The ratio of expenditure growth of the top to the bottom quintile is 2.1 \nfor PRC, 2.3 for India, 6.9 for Sri Lanka, and 4.8 for Bangladesh during 1999\u20132005 (Figure 3). \nThese increases in the absolute gaps between the rich and poor and very visible changes in the \nconsumption patterns and lifestyles of the rich are leading to a perceptible increase in social and \npolitical tensions, undermining social cohesiveness. \ntable 2\nrecent trend In Income/exPendIture InequalIty\nGInI coeffIcIents (Percent)\n  GInI coeffIcIents\neconomy   InItIal year  fInal year\nBangladesh  28.3  1991  34.1  2005\nCambodia  31.8  1993  40.7  2004\nPRC  40.7  1993  45.5  2004\nIndia  32.9  1993  36.2  2004\nIndonesia  34.4  1993  34.3  2002\nLao PDR  30.4  1992  34.7  2002\nMalaysia  41.2  1993  40.3  2004\nMongolia  33.2  1995  32.8  2002\nNepal  37.7  1995  47.3  2003\nPakistan  30.3  1992  31.2  2004\nPhilippines  42.9  1994  44.0  2003\nSri Lanka  34.4  1995  40.2  2002\nThailand  46.2  1992  42.0  2002\n\ufffdiet Nam  34.9  1993  37.1  2004\nSources\ufffd\ufffd  Staff estimates using grouped/tabulated data from World Bank\u2019s PovcalNet database, WIID2a database (World \nInstitute for Development Economic Research 2007), selected national statistics offices, and unit record data.\n\u0018  July 2007", "sectIon II\nwhy Is develoPInG asIa embracInG InclusIve Growth?\nFIGURE 2\nRECENT TREND IN INCOME/EXPENDITURE INEQUALITY\nCHANGE IN GINI COEFFICIENTS (PERCENT)\nNepal\nPRC\nCambodia\nSriLanka\nBangladesh\nLaoPDR\nIndia\nKorea,Rep.of\nTaipei,China\nVietNam\nTurkmenistan\nAzerbaijan\nTajikistan\nPhilippines\nPakistan\nIndonesia\nMongolia\nMalaysia\nKazakhstan\nArmenia\nThailand\n-5 0 5 10\nSources:  Staff estimates using grouped/tabulated data from World Bank\u2019s PovcalNet database, \n  WIID2a database (World Institute for Development Economic Research 2007), \n  selected national statistics offices, and unit record data.\nPersistent and growing inequalities in access to social services such as education and health, \nexacerbated by income inequalities, are also a significant concern for developing Asia. It is widely \nbelieved that even though Asia and the Pacific region is on track to meet the MD\ufffd target of \nreducing by half the proportion of people living on less than $1-a-day, it is unlikely to meet the \ngoals of reducing nonincome poverty (Table 3). In many countries, primary-school-age children \nfrom households of the poorest quintile are almost three times more likely to be out of school than \nthose from the richest quintile; and child mortality rates for the poorest quintiles are two to three \ntimes higher than those for the richest quintiles. In the Philippines, the situation with primary \nenrolment and measles immunization, which significantly impact on child mortality, is worse today \nthan in 1990 (Ali 2007).

First, reforms would stall, resulting \nin lower growth and higher inequalities. Second, rising absolute gaps in income and consumption \nbetween the poorest and richest quintiles could trigger social and political tensions. Third, in its \nextreme form, these tensions could lead to armed conflict as is currently happening in parts of \nSouth Asia (Murshed and \ufffdates 2006). Rising inequalities in Asia pose a clear and present danger \nto social and political stability and, therefore, the sustainability of the growth process itself.\nRising income and nonincome inequalities in Asia are associated with inequalities in the access \nto opportunities. Recent ADB studies identified a number of features of labor market outcomes in \nAsia (Felipe and \ufffdasan 2006). First, corresponding to rapid output growth, employment growth \nhas been far lower in recent years. Second, in both relative and absolute terms, the differences \n  erd workInG PaPer serIes no. 97  9", "InclusIve Growth toward a ProsPerous asIa: PolIcy ImPlIcatIons\nIfzal alI and JuzhonG zhuanG\nin real wages between the bottom and top quintiles of the labor force in urban areas increased \nsignificantly over the last two decades. At the same time, rural\u2013urban differentials in real wages \nhave also widened. Third, employment in the informal sector where productivity levels and wages \nare low is either on the rise or persistently high. Last, the nature of employment in the formal \nsector, which was historically associated with regular contracts and job security, is changing toward \nthat of the informal sector. These studies suggest that market, institutional, and policy failures \nrestrict access to opportunities.\nIn sum, developing Asia is now entering into a new stage of social, political, and economic \ndevelopment. While high \ufffdDP growth has resulted in a dramatic decrease in extreme poverty from \n1990 to 2005, income and nonincome inequalities are rising rapidly and, if these are not addressed, \nthere is a major risk to continued social and economic progress in developing Asia. To address this \nrisk, the development agenda will need to be expanded to include not only the eradication of extreme \npoverty, but also improving living standards of a much larger group who feel disenfranchised by the \nreal or perceived disadvantages associated with rising inequalities in opportunities. An inclusive \ngrowth strategy will enable developing Asia not only to accomplish its mission of eradicating extreme \npoverty but also address the legitimate concerns of this larger segment of the population.\nIII.  WhAt Is INClusIvE gRoWth: CoNCEPtuAl IssuEs\nAlthough there is yet no widely agreed formal definition for inclusive growth, a consensus \non what it entails is emerging from policy statements of various countries and their development \npartners, from discussions on development policies at international and regional forums, and from \nstudies and reports of academic and policy researchers. Inclusive growth means growth with equal \nopportunities. Inclusive growth therefore focuses on both creating opportunities and making the \nopportunities accessible to all. \ufffdrowth is inclusive when it allows all members of a society to \nparticipate in and contribute to the growth process on an equal basis regardless of their individual \ncircumstances. \nThe importance of equal opportunities for all lies in its intrinsic value as well as instrumental \nrole. The intrinsic value is based on the belief that equal opportunity is a basic right of a human \nbeing and that it is unethical and immoral to treat individuals differently in access to opportunities. \nThe instrumental role comes from the recognition that equal access to opportunities increases \ngrowth potential, while inequality in opportunities diminishes it and makes growth unsustainable, \nbecause it leads to inefficient utilization of human and physical resources, lowers the quality of \ninstitutions and policies, erodes social cohesion, and increases social conflict.\nInclusive growth based on equal opportunity differentiates inequalities due to individual \ncircumstances from those due to individual efforts (Roemer 2006). An individual\u2019s circumstances \nsuch as religious background, parental education, geographical location, and caste (in India) are \nexogenous to and outside the control of the individual, for which he or she should not be held \nresponsible. Inequalities due to differences in circumstances often reflect social exclusion arising \nfrom weaknesses of the existing systems of property and civil rights, and thus should be addressed \nthrough public policy interventions. \ufffdn the other hand, an individual\u2019s efforts represent actions that \nare under the control of the individual, for which he or she should be held responsible. Inequalities \ndue to differences in efforts reflect and reinforce market-based incentives needed to foster innovation, \nentrepreneurship, and growth. Incentives should not be disregarded. \n10  July 2007", "sectIon Iv\nwhat are PolIcy InGredIents of InclusIve Growt?\nThe differentiation of inequalities arising from efforts from those arising from circumstances \nleads to an important distinction between \u201cinequalities of outcomes\u201d and \u201cinequalities of \nopportunities\u201d (World Bank 2006). Inequalities of opportunities are mostly due to differences in \nindividual circumstances, while inequalities of outcomes such as incomes reflect some combination \nof differences in efforts and in circumstances. If policy interventions succeed in ensuring full \nequality of access to opportunities, inequalities in outcomes would then only reflect differences \nin efforts, hence could be viewed as \u201cgood inequalities\u201d, and these are inherent for any growth \nprocess (Chaudhuri and Ravallion 2007). \ufffdn the other hand, if all individuals exert the same level of \nefforts while policy interventions cannot fully compensate for the disadvantages of circumstances, \nthe resulting inequalities in outcomes are \u201cbad inequalities.\u201d While these two extreme cases are \nuseful for analytical purposes, in reality, inequalities in outcomes would consist of both good \nor desirable, and bad or undesirable inequalities. Equalities in opportunities, which emphasizes \neliminating circumstance-related bad inequalities so as to reduce inequalities in outcomes, is at \nthe core of inclusiveness and at the heart of an inclusive growth strategy.\nAlthough efforts-related inequalities are \u201cgood\u201d, they can turn to bad if not properly managed \n(Chaudhuri and Ravallion 2007). This could happen if those who are rewarded by the market with \nconsiderable market/political power use some of the rewards to engage in rent-seeking activities and \nchange the \u201crules of the game.\u201d For instance, public investment and expenditure could be skewed \nto benefit the elite, or even the entire system of property and civil rights could be skewed in their \nfavor (Bourguignon et al. 2006, Rajan and Zingales 2007). This suggests that good inequalities \nalso need to be managed and cannot be completely ignored by policies. At a minimum, the state \nhas to guard against the possibility of policy capture by these individuals. Bad inequalities can \ndrive out good ones. In particular, persistence of bad inequalities\u2014as when certain groups get left \nbehind as a result of their residing in a neglected region\u2014can reduce the tolerance for even good \ninequalities. The result can be social unrest.\nInclusive growth not only addresses the inequality issue, but also enhances the poverty re-\nduction agenda. First, the impact of growth on poverty reduction is higher when the initial level \nof inequality is lower and/or inequality declines over time. Second, inclusive growth makes poverty \nreduction efforts more effective by focusing on creating productive employment opportunities and \nmaking them equally accessible for all, while addressing extreme poverty through social safety nets \nand, therefore, moving away from the targeting approach to development. There is now a broad \nagreement that an effective poverty reduction strategy consists of two prongs, the first being \nbroad-based, pro-poor economic growth based on private sector incentives to create employment \nopportunities; and the second being public investment in basic education, health, and infrastruc-\nture. These two prongs should be supported by social safety nets to protect the very poor and \nvulnerable (Kanbur 2000). \nIn sum, an inclusive growth strategy encompasses the key elements of an effective poverty \nreduction strategy and, more importantly, expands the development agenda. A poverty reduction \nstrategy based on a single and absolute income criterion ignores the issue of inequalities and the \nrisks associated with them. In contrast, an inclusive growth strategy addresses circumstance-related \ninequalities and their attendant risks. Inclusive growth is not based on a redistributive approach to \naddressing inequality. Rather, it focuses on creating opportunities and ensuring equal access to them. \nEquality of access to opportunities will hinge on larger investments in augmenting human capacities \nincluding those of the poor, whose main asset, labor, would then be productively employed. \n  erd workInG PaPer serIes no. 97  11", "InclusIve Growth toward a ProsPerous asIa: PolIcy ImPlIcatIons\nIfzal alI and JuzhonG zhuanG\nIv.  WhAt ARE PolICy INgREDIENts oF INClusIvE gRoWth?\n\ufffdiven that inclusive growth focuses on both creating economic opportunities and ensuring \nequal access to them, an effective inclusive growth strategy should have two anchors\ufffd\ufffd (i) high \nand sustainable growth to create productive and decent employment opportunities, and (ii) social \ninclusion to ensure equal access to opportunities by all. \nA.  high and sustainable growth\n\ufffdigh and sustainable growth is the key to creating productive and decent employment \nopportunities. The strategy for igniting growth and sustaining it at a high level may differ among \ndeveloping Asian countries, depending on their current levels of incomes and extreme poverty. A \ncentral trait of the Asian growth experience has been that economies that successfully sustain \ngrowth do so by continuously adapting and changing their structure. Incrementally, but steadily, \nthey latch on to and master new and more productive activities, reaping gains along the way. The \ntransformations associated with sustained fast growth often entail a shift of output from agriculture \nto both industry and services. There has been no economy in developing Asia that has sustained \nfast growth and economic catch-up that has not also successfully industrialized. \ufffdne reason for \nthis is that industry has been where opportunities for productivity growth have been located. While \nservices have played an important role in mopping up surplus labor from agriculture, this has often \nmeant employment in low-productivity, informal activity (ADB 2007a).\nFor low-income developing Asian countries where the level of extreme poverty is still high, a \nkey challenge during the next 10\u201315 years will be to eradicate extreme poverty by accelerating the \nprocess of transition toward a low-middle-income country status. In this process, these countries \nwill transform their rural and agriculture-dominated economies into ones with higher agriculture \nproductivity, and industry and services sectors playing a much greater role in terms of both \noutput and employment. For these countries, international experiences have shown that particular \nattention is required to create and maintain hardware and software conditions that would facilitate \ntheir economic integration domestically, regionally, and globally. Integration with their regional \ncounterparts and the global economy would enable them to participate in international production \nnetworks and benefit fully from their cost advantages. Exploring the potential of market integration \nas a powerful source of growth would require continued investment in physical infrastructure and \nin human capital and skills; and continued efforts in improving business environment conducive to \nprivate entrepreneurships, foreign trade, and foreign investment. \nFor low-middle-income countries where the level of extreme poverty is low and modern sectors \n(industry and services) already dominate, a key challenge during the next 10\u201315 years will be to \naccelerate the move toward a middle-income or high-middle-income country status. International \nexperiences suggest that these countries would need to tackle three important transitions\ufffd\ufffd (i) \ntransition from diversification and producing a broader array of goods, to specialization and a \nfocus on those goods in which a country has a global comparative advantage; (ii) transition from \naccumulation or investment that simply requires more savings and more buildings, to innovation \nthat requires the ability to do things differently; and (iii) transition from basic skills or education to \nadvanced skills or tertiary education, or one where the educational system delivers a much broader \narray of skills required for the labor force (World Bank 2007). \n1\u0018  July 2007", "sectIon Iv\nwhat are PolIcy InGredIents of InclusIve Growt?\nEconomies of most low-middle-income countries are now well integrated with regional and global \neconomies and have often become an integral part of international production networks, and this \nintegration has been a major source of their recent growth. While this needs to be continued and \ndeepened, these countries should pay more attention to domestic economic integration, including \nthe integration between urban and rural sectors, not only as an effective means to reduce spatial \ninequalities, but also as a significant source of economic growth. Continued efforts are required \nin improving domestic and regional connectivity and expanding the capacities of urban cities and \ntowns to accommodate migrant workers through public investment, public and private partnerships, \nand public policies. With climate change and global warming becoming issues of global concern, \ngovernment intervention in environmental control is a necessary condition for sustaining economic \ngrowth in developing Asia, given its significant externalities. \n\ufffdigh and sustainable growth that creates productive and decent employment opportunities must \nbe driven by a dynamic private sector through market competition and market-based incentives. \nBut markets can fail and are sometimes missing. The central role of the government is to develop \nand maintain an enabling environment for business investment and private entrepreneurships by \neliminating impediments and distortions created by market failures, institutional weaknesses, and \npolicy shortcomings. This would require the government to invest in physical infrastructure and \nhuman capital, build institutional capacities, maintain macroeconomic stability, adopt market-\nfriendly policies, protect property rights, and maintain rules of law. In setting policy and reform \npriorities, the government should identify the binding constraints to growth and target its efforts \nand resources at relaxing the binding constraints.\nb.  social Inclusion\nPromoting social inclusion requires public interventions in three areas\ufffd\ufffd (i) investing in education, \nhealth, and other social services to expand human capacities, especially of the disadvantaged; (ii) \npromoting good policy and sound institutions to advance social and economic justice and level \nplaying fields; and (iii) forming social safety nets to prevent extreme deprivation.  While (i) and \n(ii) are essential to equalize opportunities, (iii) is needed to cater to the special needs of people \nwho cannot participate in and benefit from the opportunities created by growth for reasons beyond \ntheir control and to alleviate transitory livelihood shocks.\n  (a)  Expanding human Capacities\nExpanding human capacities to participate in new opportunities means investing in education, \nhealth, and other social services and other social services such as water and sanitation. \ufffdrowth \nprovides resources to permit sustained improvements in human capacities, while expanded human \ncapacities enable people to make greater contributions to growth. As education becomes more broadly \nbased and equally accessible by all, people with low incomes are better able to seek out economic \nopportunities, and their children are less likely to be disadvantaged, leading to improved income \ndistribution over time. Education is one of the most prominent determinants of movements out of \nchronic poverty. Improved health and nutrition have also been shown to have direct effects on labor \nproductivity and individuals\u2019 earning capacities, especially among the poor. \ufffdealth-related shocks \nare prominent drivers pushing people into poverty. Access to clean water and sound sanitation are \nnot only basic means of living for human beings, but also ensure their good health.  \n  erd workInG PaPer serIes no. 97  1\u0018", "InclusIve Growth toward a ProsPerous asIa: PolIcy ImPlIcatIons\nIfzal alI and JuzhonG zhuanG\n\ufffdovernment\u2014both central and local\u2014has a critical role to play in investing in education, \nhealth, and other social services, because of their public goods nature and strong externalities, \nand in making these services equally accessible by all. The role of government is to ensure that \nthese social sectors have adequate funding, good physical infrastructure, strong institutional \ncapacities, sound policy frameworks, and good governance. In many countries, governments are \noften directly involved in public service provision. Although there are instances of effective public \nprovision, more often than not, there is abundant anecdotal evidence on the failure of public \nservices. This is often attributed to a host of factors, including budgetary constraints, corruption \nand governance problems, human resource problems, or a plethora of other forms of institutional \nweakness. Equally worrying, countries where public provision fails are often also the ones that are \nunlikely to effectively regulate and monitor alternatives, such as private provision of health and \neducation services. Therefore, equal access to social services needs to be complemented by supply-\nside policies to ensure efficiency and quality of public services and demand-side policies to avoid \nmoral hazard behavior and wastages.\n  (b)  good Policies and sound Institutions\nPromoting social inclusion requires good policy and sound institutions. The expansion of \nhuman capacities would not ensure equal opportunity for all if some people do not have access to \nemployment opportunities because of their circumstances, face unfair returns on those capacities and \nunequal protection of their rights, and have unequal access to complementary factors of production \n(World Bank 2006). Such social and economic injustice is often reflective of bad policies, weak \ngovernance mechanisms, faulty legal/institutional arrangements, or market failures. In developing \nAsia, factor market (land and credit) failures are particularly acute. The central role of the government \nin promoting social and economic justice is to address all these market, institutional, and policy \nfailures. Political, economic, cultural, and social freedoms ensure that members of a society would \nnot be excluded from participating, contributing, and benefiting from the new economic opportunities \nbecause of their individual circumstances, or because they do not belong to certain power groups \nwho control political and economic decision making (Rajan and Zingales 2007).\nMany studies have shown that along with the number of jobs created in the growth process, \nit is equally important to look into the quality and decency of jobs (Felipe and \ufffdasan 2006). It is \nnow recognized that there is a strong linkage between productivity and decency of jobs. Decent \njobs\u2014which pay a fair wage rate, provide social security, offer good working conditions, and allow \na voice at work\u2014improve productivity. In developing Asia, a substantial share of poor people is \nalready at work, that is, they are the \u201cworking poor\u201d, particularly among migrant workers. For \nthem, it is not the absence of economic activity that is the source of their poverty, but the lack \nof decency and low productivity of that activity. A key element of promoting social and economic \njustice should be to ensure that men and women can earn a fair level of income from their work \nand enjoy decent working conditions.\n  (c)  social safety Nets\nPromoting social inclusion also requires the government to provide social safety nets to mitigate \nthe effects of external and transitory livelihood shocks as well as to meet the minimum needs of \nthe chronically poor. Such shocks are often created by ill health, macroeconomic crises, industrial \nrestructuring, and natural disasters. Developing and improving social safety nets through public \n1\u0018  July 2007", "sectIon v\nInclusIve Growth as the overarchInG Goal: what It ImPlIes for adb\nactions is particularly important for developing Asia as markets for insuring such risks are often \nrudimentary and, even if they exist, only cover a small segment of population. Social safety nets \nserve two main purposes. First, by providing a floor for consumption, they are a coping mechanism \nfor the very poor and the unfortunate. Second, they could provide insurance against risk to enable \nvulnerable people to invest in potentially high-return activities to lift themselves up by their \nbootstraps, i.e., social safety nets serve as springboards to enable vulnerable people to break out \nof poverty (World Bank 2001). By encouraging efforts, safety nets could contribute toward greater \nequality in outcomes.\nSocial safety nets typically take the following forms\ufffd\ufffd (i) labor market policies and programs \naimed to reduce risks of unemployment, underemployment, or low wages resulting from inappropriate \nskills or poorly functioning labor markets; (ii) social insurance programs designed to cushion risks \nassociated with unemployment, ill health, disability, work-related injuries, and old age, examples \nbeing pensions, health and disability insurance, and unemployment insurance; (iii) social assistance \nand welfare schemes such as welfare and social services, and cash or in-kind transfers intended \nfor the most vulnerable groups with no other means of adequate support, such as single-parent \nhouseholds, victims of natural disasters or civil conflicts, handicapped people, or the destitute poor; \nand (iv) child protection to ensure the healthy and productive development of children, examples \nbeing early child development programs, school feeding programs, scholarships, free or subsidized \nhealth services for mothers and children, and family allowances or credit (ADB 2007c). \nv.  INClusIvE gRoWth As thE ovERARChINg goAl: \nWhAt It ImPlIEs FoR ADb\nA.  Why ADb should make Inclusive growth Its overarching goal\nUnder its Charter, ADB is mandated to foster economic growth and cooperation in Asia and \nthe Pacific region and to contribute to the acceleration of the process of economic development \nin its developing member countries (DMCs). Starting primarily as a project lender supporting \neconomic growth, ADB has expanded its approach to encompass a wide range of economic, social, \nand environmental concerns over the last four decades since its founding. In 1999, ADB introduced \nthe Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) and declared poverty reduction as its overarching goal in \nresponse to the high level of extreme poverty in developing Asia and increasing calls from the \ninternational community to accelerate the pace of poverty reduction (ADB 1999). Subsequently, \nthe PRS became the anchor of ADB\u2019s Long-Term Strategic Framework (LTSF) 2001\u20132015 (ADB 2001). \nIn 2004, ADB adopted the Enhanced PRS (ADB 2004b), following a review of the implementation \nof the 1999 PRS. The enhancements were made to address a number of shortcomings of the PRS,3 \nas well as to respond to the changing global and regional context4 and a new, emerging global \n3 TThhee mmaajjoorr cchhaannggeess iinn tthhee eennhhaanncceedd PPRRSS iinncclluuddee ((ii)) rreefifinneemmeenntt iinn ssttrraatteeggiicc ddiirreeccttiioonn iinncclluuddiinngg ggrreeaatteerr ccoouunnttrryy ffooccuuss aanndd \nalignment of ADB operations with a country\u2019s own PRS; (ii) increased attention to results, monitoring, and evaluation; \n(iii) greater emphasis on capacity development, adopting this as a thematic priority in addition to the original PRS \nthematic priorities of private sector development, gender, environment, and regional cooperation; (iv) revision of ADB\u2019s \nproject classification to introduce the category of targeted intervention; and (v) removal of project category lending \ntargets (ADB 2006c). \n4 This is exemplified particularly by the strong recovery in Asia from the 1997 financial crisis and increasing economic \nand political uncertainties.\n  erd workInG PaPer serIes no. 97  1\u0018", "InclusIve Growth toward a ProsPerous asIa: PolIcy ImPlIcatIons\nIfzal alI and JuzhonG zhuanG\narchitecture for development assistance.5 The Enhanced PRS confirmed poverty reduction as ADB\u2019s \noverarching goal.\nWhen more than 30% of developing Asia\u2019s population amounting to close to 900 million lived \nunder extreme poverty in the late 1990s, supporting poverty reduction was no doubt the most \neffective way for ADB to assist its DMCs. In this sense the PRS, especially the Enhanced PRS, has \nserved ADB well. ADB\u2019s success in implementing the PRS has been monitored at the sector/theme, \ncountry, and institution levels. In terms of its overall performance in reducing poverty, a 2006 \nmultinational perceptions survey indicates that ADB is viewed as doing at least an average job, and \noften good or excellent (ADB 2006a). But there are lessons to learn. A recent ADB report on the \nbasis of three country studies found that a great majority of the rural poor rose out of poverty by \nmigrating to areas with dynamic growth. The report thus questioned the underlying assumptions \nand the effectiveness of household and geographical poverty targeting (ADB 2006d).\nThe changing regional context and emerging challenges of developing Asia highlighted in \nSection II make a strong case for ADB to revisit its long-term strategic directions and find a broader \ninstitutional role. First, the level of extreme poverty measured by $1-a-day declined from 34.6% \nin 1990 to 18% in 2005. If this trend is to continue, a corporate strategy narrowly focusing on \neradicating extreme poverty would become less and less relevant. Second, the level of poverty using \nthe $2-a-day poverty line only declined from 75% to 51.9% between 1990 and 2005 for developing \nAsia as a whole, suggesting that more than half of developing Asia\u2019s population still live in very \npoor conditions. But narrowly targeting at extreme poverty through the current PRS would not be \neffective in tackling this wider development problem. Third, rapidly rising inequalities have led to \nan increasing concern that benefits of Asia\u2019s spectacular growth have not been equally shared. This \nleads to increasing political and social tensions and, if left unchecked, could undermine the very \nsustainability of Asia\u2019s growth. The PRS is not designed to address the inequality issue.\nMaking inclusive growth its overarching goal would enable ADB to assist developing Asia to \nfinish the unfinished agenda of eradicating extreme poverty and, at the same time, address the \nwider development issue of rising inequalities, by supporting the creation of productive and decent \nemployment opportunities and making opportunities more equally accessible to all. Adopting this \nbroader development approach is not only important for ADB to remain relevant and responsive, \nbut would also help improve the outcome and impact of its interventions. \nb.  What Inclusive growth Implies for ADb\nMoving beyond poverty reduction and making inclusive growth the overarching goal would have \nsignificant implications for ADB. First, ADB may need to modify its corporate strategy, including its \nvision, mission, strategic pillars, and core operational and thematic priorities.\n(i)\t Vision and Mission. ADB\u2019s current vision, first introduced in the PRS in 1999 and restated \nin the Enhanced PRS in 2004, is \u201cAn Asian and Pacific region free of poverty.\u201d To achieve \nthis vision, ADB has a mission \u201cto help its DMCs reduce poverty and improve living conditions \nand the quality of life.\u201d Making inclusive growth the overarching goal may require ADB \nto redefine its vision and mission. The key ingredients of inclusive growth are creation \n5 TThhiiss rreeffeerrss iinn ppaarrttiiccuullaarr ttoo tthhee aaddooppttiioonn ooff MMDD\ufffd\ufffdss aass tthhee bbeenncchhmmaarrkk ffoorr mmoonniittoorriinngg pprrooggrreessss oonn gglloobbaall ppoovveerrttyy rreedduuccttiioonn;; \nand new emphases on development partnerships, harmonization, results orientation, and capacity development within \nDMCs in support of national poverty reduction strategies.\n1\u0018  July 2007", "sectIon v\nInclusIve Growth as the overarchInG Goal: what It ImPlIes for adb\nof opportunities through high and sustainable growth, making opportunities equally \naccessible to all, and eradicating extreme poverty. A new vision for ADB, if considered, \nshould therefore emphasize \u201cequal opportunities\u201d, in addition to \u201cfree of poverty.\u201d In \nview of this, ADB could consider a new vision such as \u201cAsia and the Pacific\u2014a region \nof prosperity, equal opportunity, and free of poverty\u201d. Correspondingly, its new mission \nstatement could be \u201cto promote inclusive growth in its DMCs.\u201d 6\n(ii)\t Strategic Pillars. ADB\u2019s current PRS is built on three strategic pillars, namely, pro-poor \nsustainable economic growth, inclusive social development, and good governance. These are \ncomplemented by five thematic priorities\ufffd\ufffd capacity development, private sector development, \ngender and development, environmental sustainability, and regional cooperation. Making \ninclusive growth the overarching goal would require ADB to redefine its strategic pillars. \nCorresponding to the two anchors of an inclusive growth strategy from the perspective \nof a DMC as detailed in Section III, ADB\u2019s strategic framework for supporting inclusive \ngrowth could adopt two pillars. The first is Investing in Creating Opportunities to support \nhigh and sustainable growth in DMCs. The second is Investing in Broadening Access to \nOpportunities to support social inclusion in developing Asia. The two pillars are mutually \nreinforcing. Improved social inclusion would help ignite growth, maintain its pace, and \nmake it more sustainable by promoting equal opportunities. \ufffdigh and sustainable growth \nwould contribute to the enhanced social inclusion by creating more productive and decent \nemployment opportunities.\n(iii)\t Core Operational Priorities. A number of factors should be considered in deciding core \noperational priorities under each strategic pillar of the proposed corporate strategy. The \nmost important is developing Asia\u2019s development priorities. \ufffdowever, ADB has limited \nresources and cannot do everything. There are also other development partners operating \nin Asia and the Pacific region. ADB\u2019s competencies, its resources base, and partnerships \nwith other development partners are also important considerations to ensure selectivity \nand aid effectiveness. While the final choices should be made through a process of \nextensive consultations\u2014externally with DMCs and other development partners and \ninternally within ADB at all levels\u2014Infrastructure, Energy and Environment, Financial Sector \nDevelopment, and Regional Cooperation are obviously among the natural choices for the \nfirst strategic pillar of Investing in Creating Opportunities to support high and sustainable \ngrowth. Meanwhile, Education, Health, and Microfinance are among the natural choices \nfor the second pillar of Investing in Broadening Access to Opportunities to support social \ninclusion. This framework also needs a set of thematic priorities to address cross-cutting \nissues and to reinforce the impact of the core operational priorities. The following could \nbe considered\ufffd\ufffd private sector development, good governance, knowledge management, and \ngender equality. \nThe proposed corporate strategy anchored on inclusive growth, if adopted, would also have \nimportant implications for country and regional operations of ADB.\n(i)\t Interventions for supporting high and sustainable growth, protecting the environment, \npromoting good governance and strong institutions, and facilitating domestic and regional \nintegration, which are important under the Enhanced PRS, are likely to become more \n6 IItt iiss aallssoo ppoossssiibbllee ttoo eemmpphhaassiizzee ootthheerr pprriioorriittiieess,, ssuucchh aass \u201c\u201crreeggiioonnaall iinntteeggrraattiioonn\u201d\u201d aanndd//oorr \u201c\u201ceennvviirroonnmmeennttaall ssuussttaaiinnaabbiilliittyy\u201d\u201d,, \nin the vision and mission statements, if considered necessary.\n  erd workInG PaPer serIes no. 97  17", "InclusIve Growth toward a ProsPerous asIa: PolIcy ImPlIcatIons\nIfzal alI and JuzhonG zhuanG\nprominent in ADB operations. This is because high and sustainable growth is the key to \ngenerate productive and decent employment opportunities; growth will not be sustainable \nwithout protecting the environment; bad policy and weak institutions are responsible for \na large part of inequalities in opportunities; and spatial disparities are a major source of \ninequalities and poverty in many countries. The most effective way of reducing spatial \ndisparity is to promote integration domestically, regionally, and globally.\n(ii)\t The proposed strategy provides scope for greater selectivity. Poverty is multidimensional, \nand targeting at poverty reduction requires ADB to provide full-fledged services to DMCs, \nwhich often results in ADB stretching too far to be effective given its limited resources. \nUnder the inclusive growth strategy, supporting high and sustainable growth and promoting \nsocial inclusion are the two mutually reinforcing strategic pillars. ADB could choose to \nfocus mainly on supporting high and sustainable growth. To support social inclusion, \nADB could choose to focus only on a few areas where ADB has competencies such as \neducation, health, water and sanitation; and, through policy dialogue and policy-based \nlending, promoting good governance and strong institutions, while ensuring other areas \nwill be adequately addressed by governments and other development partners. \n(iii)\t The proposed strategy allows ADB to move away from the direct poverty targeting approach. \nThe PRS introduced in 1999 put a great emphasis on direct poverty targeting, by giving \npriorities to projects with greater poverty impact such as those located in poor areas \nor incorporating specific poverty reduction components; requiring projects classified as \npoverty interventions to disproportionately benefit the poor; and setting specific poverty \nintervention targets. These measures were soon found to be too rigid, often leading \nto individual and household targeting that many studies have shown to be ineffective \nin sustaining poverty reduction. Although ADB has moved away from this approach in \na significant way under the Enhanced PRS, poverty targeting is still recognized as an \nimportant instrument.7 Supporting inclusive growth with a greater focus on generating \nproductive and decent opportunities would enable ADB to move further away from direct \npoverty targeting.  \n(iv)  The proposed strategy requires ADB to significantly expand the scope of its analytical work \nto support operations. The Enhanced PRS requires country-focused poverty analysis. This \nbegins with a comprehensive examination of the constraints and opportunities for poverty \nreduction in each country to assess the nature, intensity, and spread of poverty; its main \ncauses; the effects of public policies; the focus and efficiency of public expenditures; \nand the effectiveness of government programs and institutions. Supporting inclusive \ngrowth would require ADB to go beyond poverty analysis and extend the analytical work \nto deepen the understanding of underlying causes of inequality in opportunities and \nbinding constraints to inclusive growth. \n(v)  The proposed strategy requires ADB to pay greater attention to the identification of \nmarket and government failures that are often sources of the binding constraints to \ninclusive growth. This is because inequalities in opportunities are mostly reflective of \nsocial exclusion, which is largely associated with weaknesses in the existing systems of \nproperty and civil rights, market failures, and policy shortcomings. ADB interventions would \n7 DDuurriinngg 22000044\u2013\u201322000066,, aabboouutt 4455%% ooff tthhee AAssiiaann DDeevveellooppmmeenntt FFuunndd lleennddiinngg iinn UUSS ddoollllaarrss wwaass ccllaassssiififieedd aass ttaarrggeetteedd \ninventions.\n1\u0018  July 2007", "sectIon vI\nconcludInG remarks\nthen be designed exclusively to assist DMCs in addressing these market and governance \nfailures.\n(vi)\t Supporting inclusive growth does not mean that all ADB projects and programs should \nhave specific inclusiveness-enhancing components. This narrow-minded approach has in \nthe past proven to be unworkable and has led to inefficient resource utilization and poor \naid effectiveness. In many cases, the objectives of enhancing growth and broadening \ninclusiveness should be achieved through different interventions, and any attempt to \nachieve two policy objectives with one policy instrument will most likely turn out to be \ncounterproductive. The overall outcome of inclusive growth is what matters.\nvI.  CoNCluDINg REmARKs\nDeveloping Asia is now embracing inclusive growth as a key development goal because of \nrapidly rising income and nonincome inequalities, leading to increasing concerns that the benefits of \nAsia\u2019s spectacular \ufffdDP growth are not being equitably shared, which could derail the growth process \nitself. This paper clarifies that inclusive growth is growth with equal opportunity that emphasizes \nboth the creation of and equal access to opportunities for all. Inclusive growth differentiates \ninequalities due to differences in efforts from those due to differences in individual circumstances\ufffd\ufffd \nthe former reflects market-based incentives and should not be disregarded; while the latter is often \nreflective of social exclusion associated with market, institutional, and policy failures, and should \nbe eliminated. Inclusive growth is not based on a redistributive approach. A development strategy \nanchored on inclusive growth as the overarching goal encompasses the key elements of an effective \npoverty reduction strategy and, more importantly, advances the development agenda significantly. \nThis paper argues that from the perspective of a DMC, a development strategy with inclusive \ngrowth as the overarching goal should have two mutually reinforcing strategic anchors\ufffd\ufffd first, high \nand sustainable growth to create productive and decent employment opportunities; and second, \nsocial inclusion to ensure equal access to opportunities. \ufffdigh and sustainable growth should be \ndriven by a dynamic private sector. The central role of the government is to develop and maintain \nan enabling environment for business investment and private entrepreneurships by addressing market \nfailures, institutional weaknesses, and policy shortcomings through investing in infrastructure and \nhuman capital, building institutional capacities, maintaining macroeconomic stability, adopting \nmarket-friendly policies, protecting property rights, and maintaining rules of law. Promoting social \ninclusion requires public interventions in three areas\ufffd\ufffd (i) investing in education, health, and other \nsocial services to enhance human capacities; (ii) promoting good policies and sound institutions \nto advance economic and social justice and level playing fields; and (iii) providing social safety \nnets to prevent extreme deprivation.\nThe paper further agues that ADB should respond to the emerging needs of developing Asia by \nadopting inclusive growth as its overarching goal to remain a relevant and responsive development \ninstitution. This shift, if adopted, would require ADB to modify its corporate strategy. The paper \nproposes that if the shift is adopted, ADB may consider changing its vision from \u201can Asian and \nPacific region free of poverty\u201d to \u201cAsia and the Pacific\u2014a region of prosperity, equal opportunity, and \nfree of poverty\u201d; and its mission from \u201cto help its DMCs reduce poverty and improve living conditions \nand the quality of life\u201d to \u201cto promote inclusive growth in its DMCs.\u201d \n  erd workInG PaPer serIes no. 97  19", "InclusIve Growth toward a ProsPerous asIa: PolIcy ImPlIcatIons\nIfzal alI and JuzhonG zhuanG\nThe paper also proposes a strategic framework for ADB to promote inclusive growth consisting of \ntwo strategic pillars, namely, (i) Investing in Creating Opportunities to support high and sustainable \ngrowth in DMCs; and (ii) Investing in Broadening Access to Opportunities to support social inclusion \nin developing Asia. While (i) focuses on investing in the economy, (ii) emphasizes the imperative \nof investing in people. In addition, a set of core operational priorities are outlined\ufffd\ufffd  Infrastructure, \nEnergy and Environment, Financial Sector Development, and Regional Cooperation for the first strategic \npillar; and Education, Health, and Water and Sanitation for the second pillar. Further still is a set \nof thematic priorities\ufffd\ufffd Private Sector Development, Good Governance, Knowledge Management, and \nGender Equality. \nThe paper points out that the proposed corporate strategy anchored on inclusive growth would \nhave important implications for ADB\u2019s country and regional operations. The inclusive growth strategy \nwould (i) lead to more interventions designed to support high and sustainable growth, promote good \ngovernance and strong institutions, and facilitate domestic and regional integration; (ii) provide \nscope for greater selectivity; (iii) allow ADB to move further away from the direct poverty targeting \napproach; and (iv) require ADB to expand the scope of analytical work for country/regional operations \nbeyond poverty analysis to focus on identifying market and government failures that often constitute \nthe binding constraints to inclusive growth. The paper argues that supporting inclusive growth \ndoes not mean that all ADB projects and programs should have specific inclusiveness-enhancing \ncomponents. The objectives of promoting high and sustainable growth and broadening inclusiveness \nshould be achieved through different interventions. Any attempt to achieve two policy objectives \nwith one policy instrument will most likely turn out to be counterproductive. The overall outcome \nof inclusive growth is what matters.\nThe proposed inclusive growth strategy also embraces environmental protection and regional \ncooperation. \ufffdrowth would not be sustainable if the environment is not protected. The proposed new \nvision of ADB that emphasizes prosperity refers to both intracountry and intercountry prosperity. \nRegional cooperation and integration will facilitate intracountry prosperity by contributing to \ncreating higher demand for a country\u2019s goods and services through going beyond national boundaries; \nand by reducing supply costs through focusing on only those activities in which a country has a \nglobal comparative advantage. Intercountry prosperity will be facilitated by regional cooperation \nand integration through fostering the leveling of playing fields across countries. While the primary \nfocus of inclusiveness is on domestic integration, efficient and high growth so essential in creating \nproductive opportunities requires integration with regional and global markets. Thus the proposed \nADB strategy for inclusive growth would contribute to integration within countries and across \ncountries within Asia, and with the rest of the world.\n\u00180  July 2007", "references\nREFERENCEs\nADB. 1966.

They argue that this would not only enable developing Asia \nto accomplish the agenda of eradicating extreme poverty, but also address the development challenge \narising from rising inequalities. Implications for the Asian Development Bank are discussed.\nERD Working  Paper\nS E R I E S\nECONOMICS AND RESEARCH DEPARTMENT\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nThe work of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is aimed at improving the welfare of the people in Asia No9. 7\nand the Pacific, particularly the 1.9 billion who live on less than $2 a day. Despite many success stories,\nAsia and the Pacific remains home to two thirds of the world\u2019s poor. ADB is a multilateral development\nfinance institution owned by 67 members, 48 from the region and 19 from other parts of the globe.\nADB\u2019s vision is a region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member countries reduce\npoverty and improve the quality of life of their citizens.\nADB\u2019s main instruments for providing help to its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans,\ntechnical assistance, grants, guarantees, and equity investments. ADB\u2019s annual lending volume is typically\n \nabout $6 billion, with technical assistance usually totaling about $180 million a year.\nIInncclluussiivvee  GGrroowwtthh  ttoowwaarrdd  \nADB\u2019s headquarters is in Manila. It has 26 offices around the world and has more than 2,000 employees\nfrom over 50 countries.\naa  PPrroossppeerroouuss  AAssiiaa::  \nPPoolliiccyy  IImmpplliiccaattiioonnss \nIfzal Ali and Juzhong Zhuang\nJuly 2007\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/economics\nISSN: 1655-5252\nPublication Stock No.  Printed in the Philippines"], "metadata": {"Author": "Ifzal Ali, Juzhong Zhuang", "CreationDate": "D:20070702170400+08'00'", "Creator": "Adobe InDesign CS2 (4.0)", "Keywords": "inclusive growth, economic policy, poverty, development strategies, economic opportunities, corporate strategy, economics working paper no. 97", "ModDate": "D:20130806185955+08'00'", "Producer": "Adobe PDF Library 7.0", "Subject": "This paper argues that inclusive growth emphasizes creation of and equal access to opportunities and that unequal opportunities arise from social exclusion associated with market, institutional, and policy failures.", "Title": "Inclusive Growth toward a Prosperous Asia: Policy Implications", "Trapped": "False"}}
