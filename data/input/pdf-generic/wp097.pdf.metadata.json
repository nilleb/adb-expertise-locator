Despite many success stories,\nAsia and the Pacific remains home to two thirds of the world\u2019s poor. ADB is a multilateral development\nfinance institution owned by 67 members, 48 from the region and 19 from other parts of the globe.\nADB\u2019s vision is a region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member countries reduce\npoverty and improve the quality of life of their citizens.\n\nADB\u2019s main instruments for providing help to its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans,\ntechnical assistance, grants, guarantees, and equity investments. ADB\u2019s annual lending volume is typically\nabout $6 billion, with technical assistance usually totaling about $180 million a year.\n\nADB\u2019s headquarters is in Manila. It has 26 offices around the world and has more than 2,000 employees\nfrom over 50 countries.\n\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/economics\nISSN: 1655-5252\nPublication Stock No. \n\nPrinted in the Philippines\n\nERD\n\nECONOMICS AND RESEARCH DEPARTMENT\n\nWorking Paper\nSERIES\nNo.97\n\n \n\nInclusive Growth toward \nInclusive Growth toward \na Prosperous Asia: \na Prosperous Asia: \nPolicy Implications\nPolicy Implications \n\nIfzal Ali and Juzhong Zhuang\n\nJuly 2007\n\n\f\fERD Working Paper No. 97\n\nInclusIve Growth toward a ProsPerous \nasIa: PolIcy ImPlIcatIons\n\nIfzal alI and JuzhonG zhuanG\n\nJuly 2007\n\nIfzal Ali is Chief Economist, and Juzhong Zhuang is Assistant Chief Economist of the Economic Analysis and Operations \nSupport  Division,  Economics  and  Research  Department,  Asian  Development  Bank.

This paper argues that inclusive growth \nemphasizes  creation  of  and  equal  access  to  opportunities;  and  that  unequal \nopportunities arise from social exclusion associated with market, institutional, and \npolicy failures. A development strategy anchored on inclusive growth is outlined, \nconsisting of two mutually reinforcing strategic pillars of high and sustainable \ngrowth to create economic opportunities, and social inclusion to ensure equal \naccess to opportunities. This will enable developing Asia to accomplish the agenda \nof eradicating extreme poverty and, at the same time, address the development \nchallenge  brought  about  by  rising  inequalities.  It  is  argued  that  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) should respond to the emerging needs of developing \nAsia by adopting inclusive growth as its overarching goal. This goal, if adopted, \nwill require ADB to modify its corporate strategy, including its vision, mission, \nstrategic pillars, and core operational priorities. Implications for ADB\u2019s country \nand regional operations are discussed. \n\n\f\fI.  INtRoDuCtIoN\n\nDeveloping  Asia\u2019s  stellar  gross  domestic  product  (\ufffdDP)  growth  rates  have  masked  rapidly \nrising  relative and absolute  inequalities, leading to two faces of Asia. A \u201cshining Asia\u201d, which is \ncompeting internationally and benefiting from the forces of globalization, technological change, \nand  economies  of  scale,  has  grabbed  the  attention  of  the  media  and  the  world.  In  contrast,  a \n\u201csuffering Asia\u201d, not as well publicized but even more important, has unacceptably wide swatches \nof its population who are poor and vulnerable. These two faces of Asia are both a beacon of hope \nand a symbol of despair. Merging these two faces will be the development challenge over the next \ngeneration for the region.\n\nIn addressing this challenge, inclusive growth with its focus on creating economic opportunities \nand ensuring equal access to them will play a pivotal role. More and more countries are adopting \nit as the goal of development policy. India, which had poverty reduction as the central focus of its \ndevelopment strategy over the last 50 years, has recently switched to a new strategy focusing on \ntwo objectives\ufffd\ufffd raising economic growth and making growth more inclusive (Planning Commission \nof India 2006). In the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the government has made the creation of \na \u201charmonious society\u201d, a concept very closely related to inclusive growth, as the top priority in \nits 11th Five Year Plan (State Council of China 2006). In Thailand, growth with equity is one of \nthe elements of its \u201cSufficiency Philosophy\u201d, which underpins the government\u2019s development efforts \n(UNDP 2007). A similar theme can be found in \ufffdiet Nam\u2019s socioeconomic development strategy, which \nadvocates \u201cquick and sustainable development, economic growth in parallel with implementation \nof initiatives, social equity, and environment protection\u201d (The Central Committee of the Communist \nParty of \ufffdiet  Nam 2001). Inclusive growth as a development concept  is also being embraced by \nmany development partners of developing countries including bilateral and multilateral aid agencies, \ninternational organizations, nongovernment organizations, and civil society.\n\nIn the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \u201ccontributing to the harmonious growth of the region\u201d \nis mandated by its Charter (ADB 1966). The importance of \u201cinclusive growth\u201d and \u201cinclusiveness\u201d \nhas been recognized in many of its strategic documents. For instance, \u201cinclusive social development\u201d \nis  one  of  the  strategic  pillars  of  the  Enhanced  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (PRS)  (ADB  2004b). \n\u201cStrengthening  inclusiveness\u201d  is  one  of  the  strategic  priorities  of  the  Medium-Term  Strategy  II \n2006\u20132008 (ADB 2006c). More recently, a panel of eminent persons commissioned by ADB\u2019s President \nto provide insights on the region\u2019s future and on how it will affect the future role of ADB, called \non  the  institution  to  expand  its  strategic  role  from  poverty  reduction  to  inclusive  growth  (ADB \n2007b).\n\nThis  paper  examines  policy  implications  of  adopting  inclusive  growth  as  the  overarching \ndevelopment  goal  for  developing  Asia  and  for  ADB.  More  specifically,  the  paper  (i) looks  at  why \ndeveloping Asia is embracing inclusive growth; (ii) discusses the concept of inclusive growth as a \ndevelopment goal; (iii) examines policy ingredients of a development strategy anchored on inclusive \ngrowth; and (iv) examines implications for ADB if it is to adopt inclusive growth as its overarching \ngoal.\n\n\fInclusIve Growth toward a ProsPerous asIa: PolIcy ImPlIcatIons\nIfzal alI and JuzhonG zhuanG\n\nII.  Why Is DEvEloPINg AsIA EmbRACINg INClusIvE gRoWth?\n\nThe  attention  to  and  recognition  of  the  relevance  and  importance  of  inclusive  growth  in \ndeveloping Asia have been triggered by a rising concern that the benefits of spectacular economic \ngrowth have  not been equitably shared (Ali  2007). This  section explains  why  many countries of \ndeveloping Asia are embracing inclusive growth and putting it at the heart of their development \npolicy and strategy.\n\nDeveloping Asia experienced rapid economic growth during the last two decades. For developing \nAsia as a whole, per capita \ufffdDP at 2000 constant prices increased from $424 to $1,030 between \n1990 and 2005, growing at an annual rate of 6%, a pace with few parallels in history (Table 1). \nAcross the region, growth was most pronounced in East Asia at over 9%, driven largely by the PRC. \nSoutheast Asia grew at an annual rate of 3.2% despite interruptions marked by the 1997 financial \ncrisis. South Asia grew at 3.8% annually; this level of growth, although low, nevertheless represents \na significant improvement from its past, in particular, in view of the more recent acceleration in \ngrowth in several countries including India and Pakistan. \n\ntable 1\nIncome Per caPIta and Poverty IncIdence In asIa\n\nGdP Per caPIta,\nconstant 2000\nus$\n\naveraGe \nannual\nGrowth rate\n(%)\n\nheadcount ratIo\n$1-a-day \n(%)\n\nheadcount ratIo\n$2-a-day\n(%)\n\n9.11\n0.47\n9.10\n2.86\n4.20\n1.93\n1.72\n3.74\n3.75\n\n1990\n392\n451\n392\n283\n317\n176\n461\n577\n330\n--\n612\n228\n2547\n914\n1452\n227\n784\n424\n\neconomy\nPRC\nMongolia\n  East Asia\nBangladesh\nIndia\nNepal\nPakistan\nSri Lanka\n  South Asia\nCambodia\nIndonesia\nLao PDR\nMalaysia\nPhilippines\nThailand\n\ufffdiet Nam\n South East Asia\nTotal Regions\nNote\ufffd\ufffd \n \nSources\ufffd\ufffd World Bank Povcalnet database and East Asia updates for 1990 poverty estimates; poverty projections for 2005 and 2020, \n\n\ufffdeadcount ratio is poverty headcount ratio, at either $1-a-day or $2-a-day (percent of population).\nTotals for regional groupings include only those countries listed.\n\nchanGe\n\u201325.40\n\u221216.79\n\u221225.40\n1.64\n\u20138.50\n\u221219.68\n\u201337.52\n\u20131.78\n\u201310.50\n\u201319.83\n\u201313.08\n\u201331.39\n\u20130.09\n\u20139.34\n\u201310.16\n\u201344.18\n\u201316.60\n\u201316.60\n\nchanGe\n\u221242.10\n\u221227.57\n\u221242.10\n\u22124.00\n\u22126.70\n\u221218.88\n\u221228.45\n\u22127.73\n\u22128.90\n\u221221.78\n\u221220.61\n\u221221.92\n\u221213.61\n\u221215.19\n\u221226.88\n\u221247.27\n\u221222.40\n\u221223.10\n\n1990\n32.50\n27.30\n32.50\n34.40\n43.50\n45.70\n47.76\n3.82\n42.40\n32.50\n20.51\n52.74\n0.09\n20.20\n10.16\n50.66\n23.80\n34.60\n\n1990\n71.50\n69.94\n71.50\n85.70\n86.50\n84.33\n87.87\n40.58\n85.80\n76.30\n70.92\n89.60\n23.38\n55.48\n43.05\n87.00\n65.60\n75.00\n\n2005\n29.40\n42.37\n29.40\n81.70\n79.80\n65.45\n59.42\n32.85\n76.90\n54.52\n50.31\n67.68\n9.77\n40.29\n16.17\n39.73\n43.20\n51.90\n\n2005\n7.10\n10.51\n7.10\n36.04\n35.00\n26.02\n10.24\n2.04\n31.90\n12.67\n7.43\n21.35\n0.00\n10.86\n0.00\n6.48\n7.20\n18.00\n\n2005\n1449\n483\n1447\n433\n588\n234\n596\n1002\n573\n402\n942\n396\n4437\n1129\n2441\n538\n1256\n1030\n\n2.91\n3.75\n3.77\n1.42\n3.52\n5.93\n3.19\n6.10\n\nstaff estimates; per capita \ufffdDP figures from World Development Indicators Online (World Bank 2007).\n\nAsia\u2019s rapid growth has led to dramatic reduction in the level of extreme poverty. Using the \n$1-a-day poverty line established by the World Bank in 1990,1 the incidence of extreme income \npoverty declined from 34.6% to 18% between 1990 and 2005 (Table 1), with each percentage point \nof growth associated with an almost 2-percentage point decline in poverty incidence on average \n1  The $1-a-day poverty line represents the median poverty lines of the 10 countries with the lowest poverty lines at\nThe $1-a-day poverty line represents the median poverty lines of the 10 countries with the lowest poverty lines at \n that time.

The income poverty target of the Millennium Development  \ufffdoals (MD\ufffds) had been \nmet by 2005 for most Asian countries except those in South Asia. The decline in the number of \nthe extreme poor from 945 million in 1990 to 604 million in 2005 is largely attributable to the \nachievement in the PRC and \ufffdiet Nam. In South Asia, with the exception of Pakistan and Sri Lanka, \nthe incidence of extreme poverty and its magnitude in 2005 were still very significant.\n\n\ufffdowever, poverty incidence measured by $2-a-day is still very high. Using the $2-a-day poverty \nline,2 the level of poverty only declined from 75% to 51.9% between 1990 and 2005 for developing \nAsia as a whole (Table 1), suggesting that more than half of developing Asia still live in very poor \nconditions, are vulnerable to shocks, and may easily slip into extreme poverty. The decline in this \nmeasure of poverty between 1990 and 2005 was more pronounced in \ufffdiet Nam, PRC, Pakistan, and \nMongolia, and by 47.27, 42.1, 28.45, and 27.57 percentage points, respectively. The reduction in \nmost South Asian countries, however, was more limited.\n\nDespite rapid growth, developing Asia\u2019s income gap with the developed world remains astonishingly \nwide. In 2005, the average per capita \ufffdDP at 2000 constant dollar terms for developing Asia as a \nwhole was less than 3% that of Japan and the United States. Even for the PRC, which experienced \na 9% growth rate for more than 20 years, per capita \ufffdDP in 2005 was only 3.7% that of Japan and \n3.9% that of the United States (Figure 1). These suggest that developing Asia has a long way to  \ngo to catch up with the income level of the developed world. Even in terms of purchasing power \n2  The $2-a-day poverty line reflects poverty lines more commonly used in low-middle-income countries.\n\nFIGURE 1\nGDP PER CAPITA AS A PERCENT OF JAPAN\u2019S, 2005 (2000 CONSTANT US DOLLARS)\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\n4\n\nNepal\n\nLao PDR\n\nCambodia\n\nBangladesh\n\nMongolia\n\nViet Nam\n\nIndia\n\nPakistan\n\nIndonesia\n\nSri Lanka\n\nPhilippines\n\nPRC\n\nThailand\n\nMalaysia\n\nUnited States\n\nJapan\n\n6\n\n11\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n50\nPercent\n\nSource: World Development Indicators Online (World Bank 2007).\n\n \n\nerd workInG PaPer serIes no. 97  \u0018\n\n95\n\n$39,075\n\n100\n\n\fInclusIve Growth toward a ProsPerous asIa: PolIcy ImPlIcatIons\nIfzal alI and JuzhonG zhuanG\n\nparity,  which  is  considered  as  more  appropriate  for  cross-country  comparisons,  it  would  take  27 \nyears for the PRC, 40 years for Thailand, 48 years for \ufffdiet Nam, 51 years for India, and 84 years \nfor Bangladesh to catch up with Singapore\u2019s 2005 per capita \ufffdDP level under the benchmark growth \nrates (the average of the annual growth rates of  \ufffdDP per capita between 2002 and 2006). Thus, \neven within Asia, there is a lot of catching-up left.\n\nA more pressing issue for developing Asia is rapidly rising inequalities leading to an increasing \nconcern  that  benefits  of  its  spectacular  growth  have  not  been  equally  shared.  Using  the  \ufffdini \ncoefficient,  a  commonly  used  measure  of  inequality,  except  for  those  severely  hit  by  the  Asian \nfinancial  crisis  (Indonesia,  Malaysia,  Thailand)  and  Mongolia,  income  inequality  has  increased \nbetween 1990 and 2005 in all countries, with the largest jumps occurring in Bangladesh, Cambodia, \nPRC, Nepal, and Sri Lanka (see Table 2 and Figure 2). What is more disturbing is the increase in \nabsolute inequalities as measured by differences in mean consumption of the top quintile relative \nto the bottom quintile. The ratio of expenditure growth of the top to the bottom quintile is 2.1 \nfor  PRC,  2.3  for  India,  6.9  for  Sri  Lanka,  and  4.8  for  Bangladesh  during  1999\u20132005  (Figure  3). \nThese increases in the absolute gaps between the rich and poor and very visible changes in the \nconsumption patterns and lifestyles of the rich are leading to a perceptible increase in social and \npolitical tensions, undermining social cohesiveness. \n\ntable 2\nrecent trend In Income/exPendIture InequalIty\nGInI coeffIcIents (Percent)\n\nGInI coeffIcIents\n\nInItIal year \n\nfInal year\n\n28.3 \n31.8 \n40.7 \n32.9 \n34.4 \n30.4 \n41.2 \n33.2 \n37.7 \n30.3 \n42.9 \n34.4 \n46.2 \n34.9 \n\n1991 \n1993 \n1993 \n1993 \n1993 \n1992 \n1993 \n1995 \n1995 \n1992 \n1994 \n1995 \n1992 \n1993 \n\n34.1 \n40.7 \n45.5 \n36.2 \n34.3 \n34.7 \n40.3 \n32.8 \n47.3 \n31.2 \n44.0 \n40.2 \n42.0 \n37.1 \n\n2005\n2004\n2004\n2004\n2002\n2002\n2004\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2003\n2002\n2002\n2004\n\n \neconomy  \nBangladesh \nCambodia \nPRC \nIndia \nIndonesia \nLao PDR \nMalaysia \nMongolia \nNepal \nPakistan \nPhilippines \nSri Lanka \nThailand \n\ufffdiet Nam \n\nSources\ufffd\ufffd  Staff estimates using grouped/tabulated data from World Bank\u2019s PovcalNet database, WIID2a database (World \nInstitute for Development Economic Research 2007), selected national statistics offices, and unit record data.\n\n\u0018 \n\nJuly 2007\n\n\fsectIon II\nwhy Is develoPInG asIa embracInG InclusIve Growth?\n\nFIGURE 2\nRECENT TREND IN INCOME/EXPENDITURE INEQUALITY\nCHANGE IN GINI COEFFICIENTS (PERCENT)\n\nNepal\nPRC\nCambodia\nSri Lanka\nBangladesh\nLao PDR\nIndia\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nTaipei,China\nViet Nam\nTurkmenistan\nAzerbaijan\nTajikistan\n\nPhilippines\nPakistan\nIndonesia\nMongolia\n\nMalaysia\nKazakhstan\n\nArmenia\nThailand\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nSources:  Staff estimates using grouped/tabulated data from World Bank\u2019s PovcalNet database, \n \n \n\nWIID2a database (World Institute for Development Economic Research 2007), \nselected national statistics offices, and unit record data.\n\nPersistent and growing inequalities in access to social services such as education and health, \nexacerbated by income inequalities, are also a significant concern for developing Asia. It is widely \nbelieved  that  even  though  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region  is  on  track  to  meet  the  MD\ufffd  target  of \nreducing by half the proportion of people living on less than $1-a-day, it is unlikely to meet the \ngoals  of  reducing  nonincome  poverty  (Table  3).  In  many  countries,  primary-school-age  children \nfrom households of the poorest quintile are almost three times more likely to be out of school than \nthose from the richest quintile; and child mortality rates for the poorest quintiles are two to three \ntimes  higher  than  those  for  the  richest  quintiles.  In  the  Philippines,  the  situation  with  primary \nenrolment and measles immunization, which significantly impact on child mortality, is worse today \nthan in 1990 (Ali 2007). Even in the PRC with its spectacular economic growth, rising disparities in \nhealth outcomes between urban and rural populations have triggered a slowdown of improvements \nin health in the last two decades (Tandon and Zhuang 2007).\n\nIf the trend of the rising inequalities continues and is left unchecked, developing Asia would \nhave a considerable share of its population under extreme poverty even by 2020.

First, reforms would stall, resulting \nin lower growth and higher inequalities. Second, rising absolute gaps in income and consumption \nbetween the poorest and richest quintiles could trigger social and political tensions. Third, in its \nextreme  form,  these  tensions  could  lead  to  armed  conflict  as  is  currently  happening  in  parts  of \nSouth Asia (Murshed and \ufffdates 2006). Rising inequalities in Asia pose a clear and present danger \nto social and political stability and, therefore, the sustainability of the growth process itself.\n\nRising income and nonincome inequalities in Asia are associated with inequalities in the access \nto opportunities. Recent ADB studies identified a number of features of labor market outcomes in \nAsia  (Felipe  and  \ufffdasan  2006).  First,  corresponding  to  rapid  output  growth,  employment  growth \nhas been far lower in recent years. Second, in both relative and absolute terms, the differences \n\n \n\nerd workInG PaPer serIes no. 97  9\n\n\fInclusIve Growth toward a ProsPerous asIa: PolIcy ImPlIcatIons\nIfzal alI and JuzhonG zhuanG\n\nin real  wages  between the bottom and top quintiles of the labor force  in  urban areas increased \nsignificantly over the last two decades. At the same time, rural\u2013urban differentials in real wages \nhave also widened. Third, employment in the informal sector where productivity levels and wages \nare  low  is  either  on  the  rise  or  persistently  high.  Last,  the  nature  of  employment  in  the  formal \nsector, which was historically associated with regular contracts and job security, is changing toward \nthat  of  the  informal  sector.  These  studies  suggest  that  market,  institutional,  and  policy  failures \nrestrict access to opportunities.\n\nIn sum, developing Asia is now entering into a new stage of social, political, and economic \ndevelopment. While high \ufffdDP growth has resulted in a dramatic decrease in extreme poverty from \n1990 to 2005, income and nonincome inequalities are rising rapidly and, if these are not addressed, \nthere is a major risk to continued social and economic progress in developing Asia. To address this \nrisk, the development agenda will need to be expanded to include not only the eradication of extreme \npoverty, but also improving living standards of a much larger group who feel disenfranchised by the \nreal or perceived disadvantages associated with rising inequalities in opportunities. An inclusive \ngrowth strategy will enable developing Asia not only to accomplish its mission of eradicating extreme \npoverty but also address the legitimate concerns of this larger segment of the population.\n\nIII.  WhAt Is INClusIvE gRoWth: CoNCEPtuAl IssuEs\n\nAlthough  there  is  yet  no  widely  agreed  formal  definition  for  inclusive  growth,  a  consensus \non what it entails is emerging from policy statements of various countries and their development \npartners, from discussions on development policies at international and regional forums, and from \nstudies and reports of academic and policy researchers. Inclusive growth means growth with equal \nopportunities. Inclusive growth therefore focuses on both creating opportunities and making the \nopportunities  accessible  to  all. \ufffdrowth  is  inclusive  when  it  allows  all  members  of  a  society  to \nparticipate in and contribute to the growth process on an equal basis regardless of their individual \ncircumstances. \n\nThe importance of equal opportunities for all lies in its intrinsic value as well as instrumental \nrole. The intrinsic value is based on the belief that equal opportunity is a basic right of a human \nbeing and that it is unethical and immoral to treat individuals differently in access to opportunities. \nThe  instrumental  role  comes  from  the  recognition  that  equal  access  to  opportunities  increases \ngrowth potential, while inequality in opportunities diminishes it and makes growth unsustainable, \nbecause it leads to inefficient utilization of human and physical resources, lowers the quality of \ninstitutions and policies, erodes social cohesion, and increases social conflict.\n\nInclusive  growth  based  on  equal  opportunity  differentiates  inequalities  due  to  individual \ncircumstances from those due to individual efforts (Roemer 2006). An individual\u2019s circumstances \nsuch as religious background, parental education, geographical location, and caste (in India) are \nexogenous  to  and  outside  the  control  of  the  individual,  for  which  he  or  she  should  not  be  held \nresponsible. Inequalities due to differences in circumstances often reflect social exclusion arising \nfrom weaknesses of the existing systems of property and civil rights, and thus should be addressed \nthrough public policy interventions. \ufffdn the other hand, an individual\u2019s efforts represent actions that \nare under the control of the individual, for which he or she should be held responsible. Inequalities \ndue to differences in efforts reflect and reinforce market-based incentives needed to foster innovation, \nentrepreneurship, and growth. Incentives should not be disregarded. \n\n10 \n\nJuly 2007\n\n\fsectIon Iv\nwhat are PolIcy InGredIents of InclusIve Growt?\n\nThe differentiation of inequalities arising from efforts from those arising from circumstances \nleads  to  an  important  distinction  between  \u201cinequalities  of  outcomes\u201d  and  \u201cinequalities  of \nopportunities\u201d (World Bank 2006). Inequalities of opportunities are mostly due to differences in \nindividual circumstances, while inequalities of outcomes such as incomes reflect some combination \nof  differences  in  efforts  and  in  circumstances.  If  policy  interventions  succeed  in  ensuring  full \nequality of access to opportunities, inequalities in outcomes would then only reflect differences \nin efforts, hence could be viewed as \u201cgood inequalities\u201d, and these are inherent for any growth \nprocess (Chaudhuri and Ravallion 2007). \ufffdn the other hand, if all individuals exert the same level of \nefforts while policy interventions cannot fully compensate for the disadvantages of circumstances, \nthe resulting inequalities in outcomes are \u201cbad inequalities.\u201d While these two extreme cases are \nuseful  for  analytical  purposes,  in  reality,  inequalities  in  outcomes  would  consist  of  both  good \nor  desirable,  and  bad  or  undesirable  inequalities.  Equalities  in  opportunities,  which  emphasizes \neliminating circumstance-related bad inequalities so as to reduce inequalities in outcomes, is at \nthe core of inclusiveness and at the heart of an inclusive growth strategy.\n\nAlthough efforts-related inequalities are \u201cgood\u201d, they can turn to bad if not properly managed \n(Chaudhuri and Ravallion 2007). This could happen if those who are rewarded by the market with \nconsiderable market/political power use some of the rewards to engage in rent-seeking activities and \nchange the \u201crules of the game.\u201d For instance, public investment and expenditure could be skewed \nto benefit the elite, or even the entire system of property and civil rights could be skewed in their \nfavor  (Bourguignon  et  al.  2006,  Rajan  and  Zingales  2007).  This  suggests  that  good  inequalities \nalso need to be managed and cannot be completely ignored by policies. At a minimum, the state \nhas to  guard against the possibility of policy  capture  by these individuals.  Bad  inequalities  can \ndrive out good ones. In particular, persistence of bad inequalities\u2014as when certain groups get left \nbehind as a result of their residing in a neglected region\u2014can reduce the tolerance for even good \ninequalities. The result can be social unrest.\n\nInclusive growth not only addresses the inequality issue, but also enhances the poverty re-\nduction agenda. First, the impact of growth on poverty reduction is higher when the initial level \nof inequality is lower and/or inequality declines over time. Second, inclusive growth makes poverty \nreduction efforts more effective by focusing on creating productive employment opportunities and \nmaking them equally accessible for all, while addressing extreme poverty through social safety nets \nand,  therefore, moving away from the  targeting  approach to development. There is now a broad \nagreement  that  an  effective  poverty  reduction  strategy  consists  of  two  prongs,  the  first  being \nbroad-based, pro-poor economic growth based on private sector incentives to create employment \nopportunities; and the second being public investment in basic education, health, and infrastruc-\nture.  These  two  prongs  should  be  supported  by  social  safety  nets  to  protect  the  very  poor  and \nvulnerable (Kanbur 2000). \n\nIn sum, an inclusive growth strategy encompasses the key elements of an effective poverty \nreduction strategy and, more importantly, expands the development agenda. A poverty reduction \nstrategy based on a single and absolute income criterion ignores the issue of inequalities and the \nrisks associated with them. In contrast, an inclusive growth strategy addresses circumstance-related \ninequalities and their attendant risks. Inclusive growth is not based on a redistributive approach to \naddressing inequality. Rather, it focuses on creating opportunities and ensuring equal access to them. \nEquality of access to opportunities will hinge on larger investments in augmenting human capacities \nincluding those of the poor, whose main asset, labor, would then be productively employed. \n\n \n\nerd workInG PaPer serIes no. 97  11\n\n\fInclusIve Growth toward a ProsPerous asIa: PolIcy ImPlIcatIons\nIfzal alI and JuzhonG zhuanG\n\nIv.  WhAt ARE PolICy INgREDIENts oF INClusIvE gRoWth?\n\n\ufffdiven  that  inclusive growth focuses on  both creating  economic opportunities  and ensuring \nequal  access  to  them,  an  effective  inclusive  growth  strategy  should  have  two  anchors\ufffd\ufffd  (i)  high \nand sustainable growth to create productive and decent employment opportunities, and (ii) social \ninclusion to ensure equal access to opportunities by all. \n\nA. \n\nhigh and sustainable growth\n\n\ufffdigh  and  sustainable  growth  is  the  key  to  creating  productive  and  decent  employment \nopportunities. The strategy for igniting growth and sustaining it at a high level may differ among \ndeveloping Asian countries, depending on their current levels of incomes and extreme poverty. A \ncentral  trait  of  the  Asian  growth  experience  has  been  that  economies  that  successfully  sustain \ngrowth do so by continuously adapting and changing their structure. Incrementally, but steadily, \nthey latch on to and master new and more productive activities, reaping gains along the way. The \ntransformations associated with sustained fast growth often entail a shift of output from agriculture \nto both industry and services. There has been no economy in developing Asia that has sustained \nfast growth  and  economic catch-up that has not also successfully  industrialized.  \ufffdne reason for \nthis is that industry has been where opportunities for productivity growth have been located. While \nservices have played an important role in mopping up surplus labor from agriculture, this has often \nmeant employment in low-productivity, informal activity (ADB 2007a).\n\nFor low-income developing Asian countries where the level of extreme poverty is still high, a \nkey challenge during the next 10\u201315 years will be to eradicate extreme poverty by accelerating the \nprocess of transition toward a low-middle-income country status. In this process, these countries \nwill transform their rural and agriculture-dominated economies into ones with higher agriculture \nproductivity,  and  industry  and  services  sectors  playing  a  much  greater  role  in  terms  of  both \noutput and employment. For these countries, international experiences have shown that particular \nattention is required to create and maintain hardware and software conditions that would facilitate \ntheir economic integration domestically, regionally, and globally. Integration with their  regional \ncounterparts and the global economy would enable them to participate in international production \nnetworks and benefit fully from their cost advantages. Exploring the potential of market integration \nas a powerful source of growth would require continued investment in physical infrastructure and \nin human capital and skills; and continued efforts in improving business environment conducive to \nprivate entrepreneurships, foreign trade, and foreign investment. \n\nFor low-middle-income countries where the level of extreme poverty is low and modern sectors \n(industry and services) already dominate, a key challenge during the next 10\u201315 years will be to \naccelerate the move toward a middle-income or high-middle-income country status. International \nexperiences  suggest  that  these  countries  would  need  to  tackle  three  important  transitions\ufffd\ufffd  (i) \ntransition  from  diversification  and  producing  a  broader  array  of  goods,  to  specialization  and  a \nfocus on those goods in which a country has a global comparative advantage; (ii) transition from \naccumulation or investment that simply requires more savings and more buildings, to innovation \nthat requires the ability to do things differently; and (iii) transition from basic skills or education to \nadvanced skills or tertiary education, or one where the educational system delivers a much broader \narray of skills required for the labor force (World Bank 2007). \n\n1\u0018 \n\nJuly 2007\n\n\fsectIon Iv\nwhat are PolIcy InGredIents of InclusIve Growt?\n\nEconomies of most low-middle-income countries are now well integrated with regional and global \neconomies and have often become an integral part of international production networks, and this \nintegration has been a major source of their recent growth. While this needs to be continued and \ndeepened, these countries should pay more attention to domestic economic integration, including \nthe integration between urban and rural sectors, not only as an effective means to reduce spatial \ninequalities, but also as a significant source of economic growth. Continued efforts are required \nin improving domestic and regional connectivity and expanding the capacities of urban cities and \ntowns to accommodate migrant workers through public investment, public and private partnerships, \nand public policies. With climate change and global warming becoming issues of global concern, \ngovernment intervention in environmental control is a necessary condition for sustaining economic \ngrowth in developing Asia, given its significant externalities. \n\n\ufffdigh and sustainable growth that creates productive and decent employment opportunities must \nbe driven by a dynamic private sector through market competition and market-based incentives. \nBut markets can fail and are sometimes missing. The central role of the government is to develop \nand maintain an enabling environment for business investment and private entrepreneurships by \neliminating impediments and distortions created by market failures, institutional weaknesses, and \npolicy  shortcomings.  This  would  require  the  government  to  invest  in  physical  infrastructure  and \nhuman  capital,  build  institutional  capacities,  maintain  macroeconomic  stability,  adopt  market-\nfriendly policies, protect property rights, and maintain rules of law. In setting policy and reform \npriorities, the government should identify the binding constraints to growth and target its efforts \nand resources at relaxing the binding constraints.\n\nb. \n\nsocial Inclusion\n\nPromoting social inclusion requires public interventions in three areas\ufffd\ufffd (i) investing in education, \nhealth, and other social services to expand human capacities, especially of the disadvantaged; (ii) \npromoting  good  policy  and  sound  institutions  to  advance  social  and  economic  justice  and  level \nplaying fields; and (iii) forming social safety nets to prevent extreme deprivation.  While (i) and \n(ii) are essential to equalize opportunities, (iii) is needed to cater to the special needs of people \nwho cannot participate in and benefit from the opportunities created by growth for reasons beyond \ntheir control and to alleviate transitory livelihood shocks.\n\n \n\n(a) \n\nExpanding human Capacities\n\nExpanding human capacities to participate in new opportunities means investing in education, \nhealth, and other social services and other social services such as water and sanitation. \ufffdrowth \nprovides resources to permit sustained improvements in human capacities, while expanded human \ncapacities enable people to make greater contributions to growth. As education becomes more broadly \nbased and equally accessible by all, people with low incomes are better able to seek out economic \nopportunities, and their children are less likely to be disadvantaged, leading to improved income \ndistribution over time. Education is one of the most prominent determinants of movements out of \nchronic poverty. Improved health and nutrition have also been shown to have direct effects on labor \nproductivity and individuals\u2019 earning capacities, especially among the poor. \ufffdealth-related shocks \nare prominent drivers pushing people into poverty. Access to clean water and sound sanitation are \nnot only basic means of living for human beings, but also ensure their good health.  \n\n \n\nerd workInG PaPer serIes no. 97  1\u0018\n\n\fInclusIve Growth toward a ProsPerous asIa: PolIcy ImPlIcatIons\nIfzal alI and JuzhonG zhuanG\n\n\ufffdovernment\u2014both  central  and  local\u2014has  a  critical  role  to  play  in  investing  in  education, \nhealth,  and  other  social  services,  because  of  their  public  goods  nature  and  strong  externalities, \nand in making these services equally accessible by all. The role of government is to ensure that \nthese  social  sectors  have  adequate  funding,  good  physical  infrastructure,  strong  institutional \ncapacities,  sound  policy  frameworks,  and  good  governance.  In  many  countries,  governments  are \noften directly involved in public service provision. Although there are instances of effective public \nprovision,  more  often  than  not,  there  is  abundant  anecdotal  evidence  on  the  failure  of  public \nservices. This is often attributed to a host of factors, including budgetary constraints, corruption \nand governance problems, human resource problems, or a plethora of other forms of institutional \nweakness. Equally worrying, countries where public provision fails are often also the ones that are \nunlikely to effectively regulate and monitor alternatives, such as private provision of health and \neducation services. Therefore, equal access to social services needs to be complemented by supply-\nside policies to ensure efficiency and quality of public services and demand-side policies to avoid \nmoral hazard behavior and wastages.\n\n \n\n(b) \n\ngood Policies and sound Institutions\n\nPromoting  social  inclusion  requires  good  policy  and  sound  institutions.  The  expansion  of \nhuman capacities would not ensure equal opportunity for all if some people do not have access to \nemployment opportunities because of their circumstances, face unfair returns on those capacities and \nunequal protection of their rights, and have unequal access to complementary factors of production \n(World  Bank  2006).  Such  social  and  economic  injustice  is  often  reflective  of  bad  policies,  weak \ngovernance mechanisms, faulty legal/institutional arrangements, or market failures. In developing \nAsia, factor market (land and credit) failures are particularly acute. The central role of the government \nin promoting social and economic justice is to address all these market, institutional, and policy \nfailures. Political, economic, cultural, and social freedoms ensure that members of a society would \nnot be excluded from participating, contributing, and benefiting from the new economic opportunities \nbecause of their individual circumstances, or because they do not belong to certain power groups \nwho control political and economic decision making (Rajan and Zingales 2007).\n\nMany studies have shown that along with the number of jobs created in the growth process, \nit is equally important to look into the quality and decency of jobs (Felipe and \ufffdasan 2006). It is \nnow recognized that there is a strong linkage between productivity and decency of jobs. Decent \njobs\u2014which pay a fair wage rate, provide social security, offer good working conditions, and allow \na voice at work\u2014improve productivity. In developing Asia, a substantial share of poor people is \nalready  at  work,  that  is,  they  are  the  \u201cworking  poor\u201d,  particularly  among  migrant  workers.  For \nthem, it is not the absence of economic activity that is the source of their poverty, but the lack \nof decency and low productivity of that activity. A key element of promoting social and economic \njustice should be to ensure that men and women can earn a fair level of income from their work \nand enjoy decent working conditions.\n\n \n\n(c) \n\nsocial safety Nets\n\nPromoting social inclusion also requires the government to provide social safety nets to mitigate \nthe effects of external and transitory livelihood shocks as well as to meet the minimum needs of \nthe chronically poor. Such shocks are often created by ill health, macroeconomic crises, industrial \nrestructuring,  and natural disasters. Developing and improving social safety  nets through public \n\n1\u0018 \n\nJuly 2007\n\n\fsectIon v\nInclusIve Growth as the overarchInG Goal: what It ImPlIes for adb\n\nactions is particularly important for developing Asia as markets for insuring such risks are often \nrudimentary and, even if they exist, only cover a small segment of population. Social safety nets \nserve two main purposes. First, by providing a floor for consumption, they are a coping mechanism \nfor the very poor and the unfortunate. Second, they could provide insurance against risk to enable \nvulnerable  people  to  invest  in  potentially  high-return  activities  to  lift  themselves  up  by  their \nbootstraps, i.e., social safety nets serve as springboards to enable vulnerable people to break out \nof poverty (World Bank 2001). By encouraging efforts, safety nets could contribute toward greater \nequality in outcomes.\n\nSocial safety nets typically take the following forms\ufffd\ufffd (i) labor market policies and programs \naimed to reduce risks of unemployment, underemployment, or low wages resulting from inappropriate \nskills or poorly functioning labor markets; (ii) social insurance programs designed to cushion risks \nassociated with unemployment, ill health, disability, work-related injuries, and old age, examples \nbeing pensions, health and disability insurance, and unemployment insurance; (iii) social assistance \nand  welfare  schemes  such  as  welfare  and  social  services,  and  cash  or  in-kind  transfers  intended \nfor  the  most  vulnerable  groups  with  no  other  means  of  adequate  support,  such  as  single-parent \nhouseholds, victims of natural disasters or civil conflicts, handicapped people, or the destitute poor; \nand (iv) child protection to ensure the healthy and productive development of children, examples \nbeing early child development programs, school feeding programs, scholarships, free or subsidized \nhealth services for mothers and children, and family allowances or credit (ADB 2007c). \n\nv.  INClusIvE gRoWth As thE ovERARChINg goAl: \nWhAt It ImPlIEs FoR ADb\n\nA. \n\nWhy ADb should make Inclusive growth Its overarching goal\n\nUnder its Charter, ADB is mandated to foster economic growth and cooperation in Asia and \nthe Pacific region and to contribute to the acceleration of the process of economic development \nin  its  developing  member  countries  (DMCs).  Starting  primarily  as  a  project  lender  supporting \neconomic growth, ADB has expanded its approach to encompass a wide range of economic, social, \nand environmental concerns over the last four decades since its founding. In 1999, ADB introduced \nthe  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (PRS)  and  declared  poverty  reduction  as  its  overarching  goal  in \nresponse  to  the  high  level  of  extreme  poverty  in  developing  Asia  and  increasing  calls  from  the \ninternational  community  to  accelerate  the  pace  of  poverty  reduction  (ADB  1999).  Subsequently, \nthe PRS became the anchor of ADB\u2019s Long-Term Strategic Framework (LTSF) 2001\u20132015 (ADB 2001). \nIn 2004, ADB adopted the Enhanced PRS (ADB 2004b), following a review of the implementation \nof the 1999 PRS. The enhancements were made to address a number of shortcomings of the PRS,3 \nas well  as to respond to the changing global and regional context4 and  a new, emerging global \n\n3  The major changes in the enhanced PRS include (i) refinement in strategic direction including greater country focus and\nThe major changes in the enhanced PRS include (i) refinement in strategic direction including greater country focus and \nalignment of ADB operations with a country\u2019s own PRS; (ii) increased attention to results, monitoring, and evaluation; \n(iii) greater emphasis on capacity development, adopting this as a thematic priority in addition to the original PRS \nthematic priorities of private sector development, gender, environment, and regional cooperation; (iv) revision of ADB\u2019s \nproject classification to introduce the category of targeted intervention; and (v) removal of project category lending \ntargets (ADB 2006c). \n\n4  This is exemplified particularly by the strong recovery in Asia from the 1997 financial crisis and increasing economic \n\nand political uncertainties.\n\n \n\nerd workInG PaPer serIes no. 97  1\u0018\n\n\fInclusIve Growth toward a ProsPerous asIa: PolIcy ImPlIcatIons\nIfzal alI and JuzhonG zhuanG\n\narchitecture for development assistance.5 The Enhanced PRS confirmed poverty reduction as ADB\u2019s \noverarching goal.\n\nWhen more than 30% of developing Asia\u2019s population amounting to close to 900 million lived \nunder  extreme  poverty  in  the  late  1990s,  supporting  poverty  reduction  was  no  doubt  the  most \neffective way for ADB to assist its DMCs. In this sense the PRS, especially the Enhanced PRS, has \nserved ADB well. ADB\u2019s success in implementing the PRS has been monitored at the sector/theme, \ncountry,  and  institution  levels.  In  terms  of  its  overall  performance  in  reducing  poverty,  a  2006 \nmultinational perceptions survey indicates that ADB is viewed as doing at least an average job, and \noften good or excellent (ADB 2006a). But there are lessons to learn. A recent ADB report on the \nbasis of three country studies found that a great majority of the rural poor rose out of poverty by \nmigrating to areas with dynamic growth. The report thus questioned the underlying assumptions \nand the effectiveness of household and geographical poverty targeting (ADB 2006d).\n\nThe  changing  regional  context  and  emerging  challenges  of  developing  Asia  highlighted  in \nSection II make a strong case for ADB to revisit its long-term strategic directions and find a broader \ninstitutional role. First, the level of extreme poverty measured by $1-a-day declined from 34.6% \nin 1990 to 18% in 2005. If this trend is to continue, a corporate strategy narrowly focusing on \neradicating extreme poverty would become less and less relevant. Second, the level of poverty using \nthe $2-a-day poverty line only declined from 75% to 51.9% between 1990 and 2005 for developing \nAsia as a whole, suggesting that more than half of developing Asia\u2019s population still live in very \npoor conditions. But narrowly targeting at extreme poverty through the current PRS would not be \neffective in tackling this wider development problem. Third, rapidly rising inequalities have led to \nan increasing concern that benefits of Asia\u2019s spectacular growth have not been equally shared. This \nleads to increasing political and social tensions and, if left unchecked, could undermine the very \nsustainability of Asia\u2019s growth. The PRS is not designed to address the inequality issue.\n\nMaking inclusive growth its overarching goal would enable ADB to assist developing Asia to \nfinish  the  unfinished  agenda  of  eradicating  extreme  poverty  and,  at  the  same  time,  address  the \nwider development issue of rising inequalities, by supporting the creation of productive and decent \nemployment opportunities and making opportunities more equally accessible to all. Adopting this \nbroader development approach is not only important for ADB to remain relevant and responsive, \nbut would also help improve the outcome and impact of its interventions. \n\nb. \n\nWhat Inclusive growth Implies for ADb\n\nMoving beyond poverty reduction and making inclusive growth the overarching goal would have \nsignificant implications for ADB. First, ADB may need to modify its corporate strategy, including its \nvision, mission, strategic pillars, and core operational and thematic priorities.\n\n(i)\t\n\nVision and Mission. ADB\u2019s current vision, first introduced in the PRS in 1999 and restated \nin the Enhanced PRS in 2004, is \u201cAn Asian and Pacific region free of poverty.\u201d To achieve \nthis vision, ADB has a mission \u201cto help its DMCs reduce poverty and improve living conditions \nand the quality of life.\u201d Making inclusive growth the overarching goal may require ADB \nto redefine its vision and mission. The key ingredients of inclusive growth are creation \n\n5  This refers in particular to the adoption of MD\ufffds as the benchmark for monitoring progress on global poverty reduction;\nThis refers in particular to the adoption of MD\ufffds as the benchmark for monitoring progress on global poverty reduction; \nand new emphases on development partnerships, harmonization, results orientation, and capacity development within \nDMCs in support of national poverty reduction strategies.\n\n1\u0018 \n\nJuly 2007\n\n\fsectIon v\nInclusIve Growth as the overarchInG Goal: what It ImPlIes for adb\n\n(ii)\t\n\nof  opportunities  through  high  and  sustainable  growth,  making  opportunities  equally \naccessible to all, and eradicating extreme poverty. A new vision for ADB, if considered, \nshould therefore emphasize \u201cequal opportunities\u201d, in addition to \u201cfree of poverty.\u201d In \nview of this, ADB could consider a new vision such as \u201cAsia and the Pacific\u2014a region \nof  prosperity,  equal  opportunity,  and  free  of  poverty\u201d.  Correspondingly,  its  new  mission \nstatement could be \u201cto promote inclusive growth in its DMCs.\u201d 6\n\nStrategic Pillars. ADB\u2019s current PRS is built on three strategic pillars, namely, pro-poor \nsustainable economic growth, inclusive social development, and good governance. These are \ncomplemented by five thematic priorities\ufffd\ufffd capacity development, private sector development, \ngender and development, environmental sustainability, and regional cooperation. Making \ninclusive growth the overarching goal would require ADB to redefine its strategic pillars. \nCorresponding to the two anchors of an inclusive growth strategy from the perspective \nof a DMC as detailed in Section III, ADB\u2019s strategic framework for supporting inclusive \ngrowth could adopt two pillars. The first is Investing in Creating Opportunities to support \nhigh and sustainable growth in DMCs. The second is  Investing in Broadening Access to \nOpportunities to support social inclusion in developing Asia. The two pillars are mutually \nreinforcing. Improved social inclusion would help ignite growth, maintain its pace, and \nmake it more sustainable by promoting equal opportunities. \ufffdigh and sustainable growth \nwould contribute to the enhanced social inclusion by creating more productive and decent \nemployment opportunities.\n\n(iii)\t Core  Operational  Priorities.  A  number  of  factors  should  be  considered  in  deciding  core \noperational priorities under each strategic pillar of the proposed corporate strategy. The \nmost  important is developing Asia\u2019s development priorities.  \ufffdowever, ADB has limited \nresources and cannot do everything. There are also other development partners operating \nin Asia and the Pacific region. ADB\u2019s competencies, its resources base, and partnerships \nwith other development partners are also important considerations to ensure selectivity \nand  aid  effectiveness.  While  the  final  choices  should  be  made  through  a  process  of \nextensive  consultations\u2014externally  with  DMCs  and  other  development  partners  and \ninternally within ADB at all levels\u2014Infrastructure, Energy and Environment, Financial Sector \nDevelopment, and Regional Cooperation are obviously among the natural choices for the \nfirst strategic pillar of Investing in Creating Opportunities to support high and sustainable \ngrowth. Meanwhile,  Education, Health, and Microfinance are among the natural choices \nfor the second pillar of Investing in Broadening Access to Opportunities to support social \ninclusion. This framework also needs a set of thematic priorities to address cross-cutting \nissues and to reinforce the impact of the core operational priorities. The following could \nbe considered\ufffd\ufffd private sector development, good governance, knowledge management, and \ngender equality. \n\nThe proposed corporate strategy anchored on inclusive growth, if adopted, would also have \n\nimportant implications for country and regional operations of ADB.\n\n(i)\t\n\nInterventions for supporting high and sustainable growth, protecting the environment, \npromoting good governance and strong institutions, and facilitating domestic and regional \nintegration,  which  are  important  under  the  Enhanced  PRS,  are  likely  to  become  more \n\n6  It is also possible to emphasize other priorities, such as \u201cregional integration\u201d and/or \u201cenvironmental sustainability\u201d,\nIt is also possible to emphasize other priorities, such as \u201cregional integration\u201d and/or \u201cenvironmental sustainability\u201d, \nin the vision and mission statements, if considered necessary.\n\n \n\nerd workInG PaPer serIes no. 97  17\n\n\fInclusIve Growth toward a ProsPerous asIa: PolIcy ImPlIcatIons\nIfzal alI and JuzhonG zhuanG\n\n(ii)\t\n\nprominent in ADB operations. This is because high and sustainable growth is the key to \ngenerate productive and decent employment opportunities; growth will not be sustainable \nwithout protecting the environment; bad policy and weak institutions are responsible for \na large part of inequalities in opportunities; and spatial disparities are a major source of \ninequalities and poverty in many countries. The most effective way of reducing spatial \ndisparity is to promote integration domestically, regionally, and globally.\n\nThe proposed strategy provides scope for greater selectivity. Poverty is multidimensional, \nand targeting at poverty reduction requires ADB to provide full-fledged services to DMCs, \nwhich often results in ADB stretching too far to be effective given its limited resources. \nUnder the inclusive growth strategy, supporting high and sustainable growth and promoting \nsocial inclusion are the two mutually reinforcing strategic pillars. ADB could choose to \nfocus  mainly  on  supporting  high  and  sustainable  growth.  To  support  social  inclusion, \nADB  could  choose  to  focus  only  on  a  few  areas  where  ADB  has  competencies  such  as \neducation, health, water and sanitation; and, through policy dialogue and policy-based \nlending, promoting good governance and strong institutions, while ensuring other areas \nwill be adequately addressed by governments and other development partners. \n\n(iii)\t The proposed strategy allows ADB to move away from the direct poverty targeting approach. \nThe PRS introduced in 1999 put a great emphasis on direct poverty targeting, by giving \npriorities to projects with greater poverty impact such as those located  in poor  areas \nor incorporating specific poverty reduction components; requiring projects classified as \npoverty interventions to disproportionately benefit the poor; and setting specific poverty \nintervention  targets.  These  measures  were  soon  found  to  be  too  rigid,  often  leading \nto individual and household targeting that many studies have shown to be ineffective \nin sustaining poverty reduction. Although ADB has moved away from this approach in \na  significant  way  under  the  Enhanced  PRS,  poverty  targeting  is  still  recognized  as  an \nimportant instrument.7 Supporting inclusive growth with a greater focus on generating \nproductive and decent opportunities would enable ADB to move further away from direct \npoverty targeting.  \n\n(iv)  The proposed strategy requires ADB to significantly expand the scope of its analytical work \nto support operations. The Enhanced PRS requires country-focused poverty analysis. This \nbegins with a comprehensive examination of the constraints and opportunities for poverty \nreduction in each country to assess the nature, intensity, and spread of poverty; its main \ncauses;  the effects of public  policies;  the focus  and  efficiency of public expenditures; \nand  the  effectiveness  of  government  programs  and  institutions.  Supporting  inclusive \ngrowth would require ADB to go beyond poverty analysis and extend the analytical work \nto  deepen  the  understanding  of  underlying  causes  of  inequality  in  opportunities  and \nbinding constraints to inclusive growth. \n\n(v) \n\nThe  proposed  strategy  requires  ADB  to  pay  greater  attention  to  the  identification  of \nmarket  and  government  failures  that  are  often  sources  of  the  binding  constraints  to \ninclusive growth. This is because inequalities in opportunities are mostly reflective of \nsocial exclusion, which is largely associated with weaknesses in the existing systems of \nproperty and civil rights, market failures, and policy shortcomings. ADB interventions would \n\n7  During 2004\u20132006, about 45% of the Asian Development Fund lending in US dollars was classified as targeted\nDuring  2004\u20132006,  about  45%  of  the  Asian  Development  Fund  lending  in  US  dollars  was  classified  as  targeted \ninventions.\n\n1\u0018 \n\nJuly 2007\n\n\fsectIon vI\nconcludInG remarks\n\nthen be designed exclusively to assist DMCs in addressing these market and governance \nfailures.\n\n(vi)\t\n\nSupporting inclusive growth does not mean that all ADB projects and programs should \nhave specific inclusiveness-enhancing components. This narrow-minded approach has in \nthe past proven to be unworkable and has led to inefficient resource utilization and poor \naid  effectiveness.  In  many  cases,  the  objectives  of  enhancing  growth  and  broadening \ninclusiveness  should  be  achieved  through  different  interventions,  and  any  attempt  to \nachieve two policy objectives with one policy instrument will most likely turn out to be \ncounterproductive. The overall outcome of inclusive growth is what matters.\n\nvI.  CoNCluDINg REmARKs\n\nDeveloping  Asia  is  now  embracing  inclusive  growth  as  a  key  development  goal  because  of \nrapidly rising income and nonincome inequalities, leading to increasing concerns that the benefits of \nAsia\u2019s spectacular \ufffdDP growth are not being equitably shared, which could derail the growth process \nitself. This paper clarifies that inclusive growth is growth with equal opportunity that emphasizes \nboth  the  creation  of  and  equal  access  to  opportunities  for  all.  Inclusive  growth  differentiates \ninequalities due to differences in efforts from those due to differences in individual circumstances\ufffd\ufffd \nthe former reflects market-based incentives and should not be disregarded; while the latter is often \nreflective of social exclusion associated with market, institutional, and policy failures, and should \nbe eliminated. Inclusive growth is not based on a redistributive approach. A development strategy \nanchored on inclusive growth as the overarching goal encompasses the key elements of an effective \npoverty reduction strategy and, more importantly, advances the development agenda significantly. \n\nThis paper argues that from the perspective of a DMC, a development strategy with inclusive \ngrowth as the overarching goal should have two mutually reinforcing strategic anchors\ufffd\ufffd first, high \nand  sustainable growth to create productive and decent employment opportunities;  and second, \nsocial inclusion to ensure equal access to opportunities. \ufffdigh and sustainable growth should be \ndriven by a dynamic private sector. The central role of the government is to develop and maintain \nan enabling environment for business investment and private entrepreneurships by addressing market \nfailures, institutional weaknesses, and policy shortcomings through investing in infrastructure and \nhuman  capital,  building  institutional  capacities,  maintaining  macroeconomic  stability,  adopting \nmarket-friendly policies, protecting property rights, and maintaining rules of law. Promoting social \ninclusion requires public interventions in three areas\ufffd\ufffd (i) investing in education, health, and other \nsocial services to enhance human capacities; (ii) promoting good policies and sound institutions \nto advance economic and social justice and level playing fields; and (iii) providing social safety \nnets to prevent extreme deprivation.\n\nThe paper further agues that ADB should respond to the emerging needs of developing Asia by \nadopting inclusive growth as its overarching goal to remain a relevant and responsive development \ninstitution. This shift, if adopted, would require ADB to modify its corporate strategy. The paper \nproposes  that if the shift is adopted,  ADB may consider changing  its vision from  \u201can Asian and \nPacific region free of poverty\u201d to \u201cAsia and the Pacific\u2014a region of prosperity, equal opportunity, and \nfree of poverty\u201d; and its mission from \u201cto help its DMCs reduce poverty and improve living conditions \nand the quality of life\u201d to \u201cto promote inclusive growth in its DMCs.\u201d \n\n \n\nerd workInG PaPer serIes no. 97  19\n\n\fInclusIve Growth toward a ProsPerous asIa: PolIcy ImPlIcatIons\nIfzal alI and JuzhonG zhuanG\n\nThe paper also proposes a strategic framework for ADB to promote inclusive growth consisting of \ntwo strategic pillars, namely, (i) Investing in Creating Opportunities to support high and sustainable \ngrowth in DMCs; and (ii) Investing in Broadening Access to Opportunities to support social inclusion \nin developing Asia. While (i) focuses on investing in the economy, (ii) emphasizes the imperative \nof investing in people. In addition, a set of core operational priorities are outlined\ufffd\ufffd  Infrastructure, \nEnergy and Environment, Financial Sector Development, and Regional Cooperation for the first strategic \npillar; and Education, Health, and Water and Sanitation for the second pillar. Further still is a set \nof thematic priorities\ufffd\ufffd Private Sector Development, Good Governance, Knowledge Management, and \nGender Equality. \n\nThe paper points out that the proposed corporate strategy anchored on inclusive growth would \nhave important implications for ADB\u2019s country and regional operations. The inclusive growth strategy \nwould (i) lead to more interventions designed to support high and sustainable growth, promote good \ngovernance and strong institutions, and facilitate domestic and regional integration; (ii) provide \nscope for greater selectivity; (iii) allow ADB to move further away from the direct poverty targeting \napproach; and (iv) require ADB to expand the scope of analytical work for country/regional operations \nbeyond poverty analysis to focus on identifying market and government failures that often constitute \nthe  binding  constraints  to  inclusive  growth.  The  paper  argues  that  supporting  inclusive  growth \ndoes not mean that all ADB projects and programs should have specific inclusiveness-enhancing \ncomponents. The objectives of promoting high and sustainable growth and broadening inclusiveness \nshould be achieved through different interventions. Any attempt to achieve two policy objectives \nwith one policy instrument will most likely turn out to be counterproductive. The overall outcome \nof inclusive growth is what matters.\n\nThe proposed inclusive growth strategy also embraces environmental protection and regional \ncooperation. \ufffdrowth would not be sustainable if the environment is not protected. The proposed new \nvision of ADB that emphasizes prosperity refers to both intracountry and intercountry prosperity. \nRegional  cooperation  and  integration  will  facilitate  intracountry  prosperity  by  contributing  to \ncreating higher demand for a country\u2019s goods and services through going beyond national boundaries; \nand by reducing supply costs through focusing on only those activities in which a country has a \nglobal comparative advantage. Intercountry prosperity will be facilitated by regional cooperation \nand integration through fostering the leveling of playing fields across countries. While the primary \nfocus of inclusiveness is on domestic integration, efficient and high growth so essential in creating \nproductive opportunities requires integration with regional and global markets. Thus the proposed \nADB  strategy  for  inclusive  growth  would  contribute  to  integration  within  countries  and  across \ncountries within Asia, and with the rest of the world.\n\n\u00180 \n\nJuly 2007\n\n\freferences\n\nREFERENCEs\n\nADB. 1966.

They argue that this would not only enable developing Asia \nto accomplish the agenda of eradicating extreme poverty, but also address the development challenge \narising from rising inequalities. Implications for the Asian Development Bank are discussed.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nThe work of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is aimed at improving the welfare of the people in Asia\nand the Pacific, particularly the 1.9 billion who live on less than $2 a day. Despite many success stories,\nAsia and the Pacific remains home to two thirds of the world\u2019s poor. ADB is a multilateral development\nfinance institution owned by 67 members, 48 from the region and 19 from other parts of the globe.\nADB\u2019s vision is a region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member countries reduce\npoverty and improve the quality of life of their citizens.\n\nADB\u2019s main instruments for providing help to its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans,\ntechnical assistance, grants, guarantees, and equity investments. ADB\u2019s annual lending volume is typically\nabout $6 billion, with technical assistance usually totaling about $180 million a year.\n\nADB\u2019s headquarters is in Manila. It has 26 offices around the world and has more than 2,000 employees\nfrom over 50 countries.\n\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/economics\nISSN: 1655-5252\nPublication Stock No. \n\nPrinted in the Philippines\n\nERD\n\nECONOMICS AND RESEARCH DEPARTMENT\n\nWorking Paper\nSERIES\nNo.97\n\n \n\nInclusive Growth toward \nInclusive Growth toward \na Prosperous Asia: \na Prosperous Asia: \nPolicy Implications\nPolicy Implications \n\nIfzal Ali and Juzhong Zhuang\n\nJuly 2007\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["ERD Working Paper No. 97\n", "InclusIve Growth toward a ProsPerous \nasIa: PolIcy ImPlIcatIons\n", "Ifzal alI and JuzhonG zhuanG\n", "July 2007\n", "Ifzal Ali is Chief Economist, and Juzhong Zhuang is Assistant Chief Economist of the Economic Analysis and Operations \nSupport  Division,  Economics  and  Research  Department,  Asian  Development  Bank.
