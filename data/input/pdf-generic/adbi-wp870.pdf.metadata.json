INTRODUCTION \nFollowing the successful climate agreement in Paris at the end of COP 21, global \nattention  shifted  quickly  to  how  countries  will  achieve  their  nationally  determined \ncontributions  (NDCs).  Achieving  NDC  targets  requires  investments  in  a  range  of \ntechnologies, projects, and businesses in a variety of sectors, including energy supply \nand distribution. These investments, often termed \u201cgreen,\u201d are needed throughout the \ncycle  of  innovation  and  market  transformation,  from  research  and  development, \nthrough  demonstration,  deployment,  and  diffusion,  to  the  commercial  maturity  of \ntechnologies and infrastructure projects. Addressing the specific sectoral investment \nneeds and financing the transition are challenging (Anbumozhi, Kalirajan, and Kimua \n2018) as it involves several interrelated risks.  \nAccording to the Climate Policy Initiative (2017), climate finance reached a peak at \n$437 billion dollars in 2015 and then dropped to $383 billion in 2016, a 12% drop, but \nthe real issue is that demand for finance remains far below estimates of what is \nrequired.  Furthermore,  Treco  et  al.  (2018)  estimated  that  for  the  energy  sector, \nincluding energy efficiency improvement in power, transportation, and buildings will \nrequire a total over $1 trillion per year through to 2030 in the emerging economies of \nAsia. It is encouraging to see increased private sector activity in the maturing markets \nfor renewable energy, and steady public financial support has been key, but funding \nremains a daunting task. The expected financing needs are large: A review of NDCs \nand  other  policies  in  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN),  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, and India, which represent 37% of global greenhouse  \ngas (GHG) emissions, finds an initial investment opportunity of $22.6 trillion during \n2016\u20132030 in key energy sectors (Kumar, Anizuzzaman, and Das 2017). Although \nthese estimates refer to levels of investment, most of these resources are intended to \nflow  through  the  financial  sector  as  bank  lending,  project  financing,  institutional \ninvesting, or equity investing (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] and the \nWorld Bank Group 2017). \nThe largest climate mitigation sector, energy supply, is actually expected to see an \noverall  increase  of  $67  billion  in  investment  at  the  global  level.  In  total,  about \n$200\u00b0billion in additional investment needs to be mobilized annually. This does not \ninclude the underlying investment requirements that various sectors would normally \nneed to mobilize for development regardless of Paris agreement commitments. For \ninstance, in the power sector, when the underlying investment requirements are added \nto additional decarbonization costs, about $148 billion out of $432 billion is projected to \nbe green or low carbon, such as for renewables, and carbon capture and storage.  \nIn  all,  70%  of  these  green  infrastructure  needs  will  be  in  emerging  markets  and \ndeveloping economies (Meltzer 2016). \nPublic finance and international official development assistance can and will play a \ncritical role to jump start, leverage, and guide green investments, but transformational \nchange  will  inevitably  require  large-scale  private  financing.  This  is  because  most \ndeveloping countries have a low tax base, with limited ability of their citizens to pay for \nthe services provided to them, and the government cannot raise the necessary funds \nthrough taxation. \nHowever, traditional sources of private financing for green energy infrastructure also \nface  significant financial,  regulatory,  and  structural  constraints. Green  markets  are \nunable to garner their full potential due to issues such as the creditworthiness and \nbankability of such projects. Moreover, many banks are reluctant to lend to the green \nenergy sector because many technologies in this sector are new and hence financiers \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 870  David and Venkatachalam \n \nconsider them risky (Anbumozhi and Rakhmah 2018). Especially in Asia, where banks \ndominate the financial markets and capital markets are tiny, this is a major challenge. \nThus, there  is  a  critical  need to develop  new  financing  instruments (Yoshino  and \nTaghizadeh-Hesary 2018). In such cases, governments, although risky partners, will \nbenefit from private sector participation through public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) and \ngreen investment banks (GIBs). Whether private capital can be mobilized to support \ngreen  infrastructure  development  will  depend  on  the  risk  return  profile  of  the \ninvestments and the regulatory environment in which these investments operate. \nPPPs and GIBs can be understood as the intersection and alliance between public and \nprivate financial institutions to supply green finance jointly in a cost-effective way. While \nPPPs aim to provide public infrastructure service delivery through a mutually beneficial \npartnership, GIBs seek to leverage private finance for green investments. Therefore, \nthey provide frameworks to ensure private leadership and accountability in tackling \npublic good challenges, such as climate, while leveraging and enabling the ownership \nto be transferred to private hands. Moreover, PPPs and GIBs provide countries with \nlimited public finance to crowd in private finance to supply investment needs. In this \nsituation, efficient and effective risk allocation is crucial to increase investment, and \ninternational cooperation can play a further constructive role, providing a variety of \nfunding,  technical  assistance,  and  guarantee  measures  for  green  infrastructure  \nprojects (Gardiner 2015). PPPs in effect allow for the transfer of investment risks to the \nprivate sector concerning projects that are traditionally executed or financed by the \npublic sector.  \nThe objective of this paper is to provide policy makers with a comparative review of \nPPPs and GIBs, and the associated interventions that can enable risk mitigation or \nlower transaction costs. Based on the analysis, it proposes a framework that can  \nbe  used  to  identify  where  advanced  economies  like  Japan  can  support  emerging \neconomies like India in providing public\u2013private investments, and in the establishment \nand funding of GIBs when investments are not flowing at the pace and on the scale \nrequired. This paper builds on the review of general trends in PPP investments, the rise \nof numerous GIBs, and detailed analysis of case studies that help contribute to a better \nunderstanding of these institutional mechanisms. \n2.  USING PUBLIC\u2013PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS  \nTO SCALE UP GREEN INVESTMENT \nAccording to the Climate Policy Initiative (2017), private sector investment has taken \nthe largest share in climate finance over recent years and project developers have \nconsistently  being  driving  the  largest  volume  of  private  finance,  as  exemplified  in \nFigure 1. While the share of more traditional lenders in the green climate financing mix \nsignals a maturing technology market, more commercial finance institutions are taking \na larger role, with institutional investment growing rapidly. In terms of public sector \ninvestments, in 2015 development finance institutions accounted for the majority of \npublic flows, contributing 89% of the total public finance (Climate Policy Initiative 2017). \nThe  general  trend  suggests  the  need  for  dedicated  green  finance  institutions  to \nleverage private finance that can help close the funding gap for many low-carbon \ninvestments, especially in developing countries like India. \n   \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 870  David and Venkatachalam \n \nFigure 1: Global Investment to Address Climate Change by Public  \nand Private Sector Investors 2012\u20132016 \n \nSource: Climate Policy Initiative 2017. \nAs  green  energy  projects  require  high  upfront  investment,  private  sector  capital, \ntechnology and innovation have often been routed through PPPs to supplement limited \npublic sector funding in providing such services.  \nThe real challenge for green technology and infrastructure projects is that they are very \nsimilar to other infrastructure projects, and therefore should rely on proven project \nfinancing  approaches.  Infrastructure  projects  generally  face  significant  financing \nbarriers due to high upfront capital costs and long-term payoffs, which increase the \ncost  of capital  and  reduce  its  availability.  High  transaction  costs,  a  lack  of  viable \nfunding models, and exposure to political risk are other barriers that increase the risk of \ninvesting in green infrastructure (Meltzer 2016). \n \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 870  David and Venkatachalam \n \nWith the private sector alone being unable to mitigate externalities and monetize, many \ngreen investments often require the support of the public through PPPs and GIBs. \nHowever, these two forms of arrangement still need to exist in an overarching policy \nenvironment  that  provides  green  technologies  with  subsidy  support,  which  is  no \ndifferent from many other infrastructure projects. Such hybrid financing schemes are \nincreasingly common as projects become more complex and are not viable purely \nbased on private financing structures. Green technologies must develop an equitable \nrisk  allocation  framework  that  can  provide  a  compelling  argument  for  different \nstakeholders to support these investments through subsidized financing to the extent \nthat this financing is justifiable from a public good perspective. \nMoreover, the successful financial closure of green energy projects will improve their \ncontribution to climate change by locking new investments into clean technology over \ntheir  lifetime,  while  displacing  low-cost  polluting  alternatives.  This  is  significant  as \ncarbon mitigation initiatives often deal with emissions of pre-existing assets rather than \nintroducing new clean investments (Baietti 2013). \nConcessional PPP schemes have a particularly key role to play as a low-cost source of \nfinance, which, when blended with other sources of public finance, can de-risk green \ninfrastructure projects and crowd in private finance. Concessional PPPs are especially \nneeded in the early project preparation and construction phases of PPP infrastructure \nprojects, when the risks are highest and capital most costly and scarce. Once green \nenergy projects commence operations and generate returns, the risks are reduced, and \nthese projects can be securitized and sold to institutional investors looking for low-risk \nand stable returns. The higher the risk, the more early-stage concessional green PPPs \ncan then be recycled into other green infrastructure projects. \nMoreover, the development of financial instruments such as green bonds can be linked \nto PPP projects that can attract institutional investments (Meltzer 2016). With PPPs, \nthe spillover effects originally created for energy supplies need to be used, and tax \nrevenues  refunded  to  the  investors  in  energy  projects  (Yoshino  and  Taghizadeh-\nHesary 2017). Thus, a well-designed PPP can be an opportunity to scale up funding  \nfor clean energy internationally and in effect contribute to the battle against climate \nchange. Although the potential benefits of PPPs are many, there remain challenges  \nfor  host  governments  and  various  partners  (including  the  private  sector,  bilateral \ndonors, and multilateral institutions) in the allocation of risks, as well as the sharing of \nrewards. When  disputes  occur  between  the  private  sector  and  host governments, \ninternational financial institutions (IFIs) can play an important role in resolving these, \nand help ensure the fair sharing of the risks and the rewards of the PPP for all the \nparties involved. \n3.  ROLE OF GREEN INVESTMENT BANKS IN \nBOOSTING LOW-CARBON INVESTMENTS \nGIBs, as public or semi-public entities, are increasingly being used to facilitate the \nattraction of private capital into domestic investments, mainly in low-carbon energy \ninfrastructure, which can help to meet NDC targets. These new institutions are publicly \nfunded  and  offer  preferential  rate  lending  to  finance  renewable  energy,  energy \nefficiency, and other clean energy infrastructure projects in partnership with private \nlenders. Using innovative transaction structures, and risk-reduction and transaction-\nenabling techniques, with local market expertise, GIBs are well positioned to channel \nprivate investments into green projects. GIBs primarily leverage the impact of relatively \nlimited public resources. As of 2015, 13 national and sub-national governments have \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 870  David and Venkatachalam \n \ncreated public GIBs or similar entities (Table 1). GIBs and similar entities have been \nestablished at the national level (Australia, Japan, Malaysia, Switzerland, the United \nKingdom [UK]), the state level (California, Connecticut, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, \nand Rhode Island in the United States [US]), the county level (Montgomery County and \nMaryland in the US), and the city level (Masdar in the United Arab Emirates [UAE]) \n(OECD and Bloomberg Philanthropies 2015).  \nTable 1: Selected Examples of GIBs and GIB-like Entities and their Funding  \nOperational GIBs and  Year \nGIB-like Entities  Location  Instituted  Funding Sources \nConnecticut Green Bank  Connecticut,  2011  Revenue from loans and emissions trading \nUS  schemes, and utility bill surcharges, renewable \nportfolio standards, energy efficiency resource \nstandards \nClean Energy Finance  Australia  2012  Appropriations \nCorporation (CEFC) \nUK Green Investment  UK  2012  National government funding \nBank \nGreen Fund   Japan  2013  Carbon tax revenue \nGreen Energy Market  Hawaii, US  2014  Bond issuance \nSecuritization (GEMS) \n(Hawaii Green \nInfrastructure Authority) \nNew Jersey Energy  New Jersey, US  2014  National government funding \nResilience Bank (ERB) \nNY Green Bank  New York, US  2014  Revenue from emissions trading schemes, utility \nbill surcharges, renewable portfolio standards, \nenergy efficiency resource and utility bill \nsurcharges, renewable portfolio standards, \nenergy efficiency resource standards, and \nreallocation of funds from existing programs \nSource: Adopted from OECD 2017. \nGIBs are, by virtue of their design, created to address local market and policy failures, \naiming to increase private sector investment in domestic low-carbon infrastructure, \nleveraging the limited public capital. They are especially important for countries that do \nnot  have  national  development  banks  or  similar  entities  actively  promoting  private \ninvestment in domestic infrastructures that are deemed to be green. Even if dedicated \ninfrastructure and development banks do exist, governments can consider establishing \nGIBs as a means of \u201cmainstreaming\u201d green investment objectives in existing national \ndevelopment  banks  to  mobilize  more  investment  in  support  of  clean  energy  and \ntechnology projects.  \nGIBs are created not only to meet ambitious emissions targets, but also to support \nlocal community development, lower energy costs, develop green technology markets, \ncreate jobs, and lower the cost of capital for green infrastructure projects (OECD and \nBloomberg Philanthropies 2015). It is important to use a range of metrics to measure \nand  track  the  performance  of these  projects to  keep  them  accountable  for  public \nmoney. These metrics generally focus on emissions saved, job creation, leverage \nratios (i.e., private investment mobilized per unit of public spending), and when these \nbanks are required to be profitable, the rate of return is also included. GIBs adopt a \ndifferent approach from that of many grant-making public institutions and follow strict \nmandates to mobilize investment using limited public capital (Geddes et al. 2018). They \ncatalyze private financing for low-carbon technologies by using financial tools such as \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 870  David and Venkatachalam \n \nlong-term  and  low-interest  loans,  revolving  loan  funds,  insurance  products  (loan \nguarantees or loan loss reserves), green bonds, and low-cost public investment. When \na GIB uses public funds for financing, rather than grants or subsidies, the public funds \nare preserved through loan repayment. \nGIBs are essentially mandated to provide the following services: (i) attractive and \nflexible low-cost financing terms, (ii) credit support, (iii) co-investment, (iv) standards, \n(v) increased supply of capital (NRDC and CEEW 2016). It is important to ensure that \nGIBs do not to replace or \u201ccrowd out\u201d commercial banks and private investors, but \nactually \u201ccrowd in\u201d private capital. They can play a transformative role as they are \nneither a traditional government program with limited engagement with markets, nor \nprivate entities weighed down by competitive pressures and fiduciary constraints, and \ntherefore are able to achieve their goals. \nThere  are  promising  examples,  wherein  governments,  cognizant  of  technical  and \nregulatory barriers and opportunities for mobilizing private capital, have sometimes \nappointed state investment banks as GIBs to close financing gaps, such as the case of \nGermany\u2019s Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW). \nThe UK GIB was founded in 2012 in the same way, with public funding and the goal to \nassist the nation in transitioning toward a more sustainable economy by mobilizing the \nuse of private sector capital in low-carbon energy projects (UK Green Investment Bank \n2017). It was set up as an independent government-owned entity, capitalized with  \n\u00a33 billion ($4.6 billion). It invests on terms similar to those of commercial banks and is \nrequired to meet a minimum 3.5% annual return on investments before tax (OECD and \nBloomberg Philanthropies 2015). To comply with European Union (EU) rules, approval \nfor creation of the GIB was given provided it only lent to projects and sectors not \nconsidered investable by private or commercial funding. This provided the GIB an \nadditional focus of crowding in private finance to such projects; essentially the private \nsector could leverage these public funds and risk mitigation instruments.  \nToday, the GIB provides a wide range of financial instruments, including long-term \nfixed market rate debt, mezzanine and subordinated debt, and equity and bridging \nequity  loans, to target sectors  such  as  offshore  wind,  waste-to-energy,  bioenergy, \nenergy efficiency, and more recently, onshore wind. The bank disburses loans through \ndirect financing, co-financing partnership programs, and own managed funds, as well \nas contributing to third-party managed funds, financing 69 projects between 2012 and \n2016  (GIB  2017).  The  financial  performance  and  other  performance  indicators  of  \nthe GIB are presented in Table 2 for the years 2013\u20132017. By 2016, the GIB had \ncommitted \u00a32.1 billion ($3.2 billion) cumulative investments toward a total of \u00a38.5 billion \n($13 billion) worth of project value, leveraging \u00a33 from the private sector for every  \n\u00a31  invested  by  the  bank  (GIB  2017).  Interestingly,  there  is  a  positive  correlation \nbetween the capital committed and profit before tax and renewable energy produced, \nindicating a successful lending portfolio.  \n   \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 870  David and Venkatachalam \n \nTable 2: UK Green Investment Bank Limited (GIB) Performance Highlights \nPerformance Indicator  2013\u20132014  2014\u20132015  2015\u20132016  2016\u20132017 \nCapital committed (\u00a3 million)  617  723  770  839 \nProfit before tax (\u00a3 million)  (5.7)  0.1  9.9  24 \nTotal transaction value (\u00a3 billion)  2.3  2.5  3.7  1.4 \nProjected portfolio return (%)  8  9  10  10 \nProjects financed  17  22  30  24 \nRenewable energy produced (TWh)  12.8  16.3  20.3  21.5 \nSource: GIB Annual Report. http://greeninvestmentgroup.com/media/185901/gib-annual-report-2016-17-final.pdf  \nGermany\u2019s  KfW  is  another  exemplary  effort.

TYPES OF PUBLIC\u2013PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS  \nAND GREEN INVESTMENT BANK INTERVENTIONS \nIN JAPAN \n4.1  Green Public\u2013Private Partnerships Investments \nPPPs have recently been promoted more aggressively by the Japanese government as \npart of its economic growth and stimulus strategy. The high costs of retrofitting aging \npublic infrastructures, which were built during a high-growth period, in combination with \nfalling fees and populations, have pushed local governments to look for alternative \nways of financing and maintaining public assets. Renewable energy, public sewage \nfacilities, and waste treatment plants and projects form the largest class of public \ninfrastructure, with more than 3,600 public enterprises operating in the country. In \nMarch 2016, the total number of PPP projects, also known as the private finance \ninitiative (PFI), totaled 527. These arrangements cover the operation and management \nof public facilities in the energy, water, and waste sectors, as well as cultural centers \nand medical facilities. Waste-to-energy projects have attracted considerable financing \nthrough the PFI.  \nAlthough many cities have introduced power generation at waste incineration plants, \nthey  are  not  financially  viable  in  terms  of  making  the  necessary  large-scale \ninvestments. The case of Yokote is interesting as the city is located in an agricultural \narea with a population of only 100,000. After evaluating the costs of different business \nmodels,  including  the  conventional  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction  \n(EPC) model, and the design, build, and operate (DBO) model, the city chose the  \nlatter. The city offered a tender and concluded contracts with a private consortium  \nfor  construction,  operation,  and  management  amounting  to  \u00a58,267  million  and  \n\u00a57,070  million,  respectively,  over  20  years.  The  city  prepared  the  funding  for  the \nconstruction  of  the  plant  using  the  Special  Bond  for  Municipality  Amalgamation,  \nwith  about  70%  of  the  principal  and  interest  payment  shouldered  by  the  national \ngovernment  and  a  government  subsidy  program  for  promoting  investments  that \ncontribute to the circular economy. More than three-quarters of capital expenditure was \ndirectly  or  indirectly  paid  by  the  national  government.  The  DBO  model  is  now  a \nstandardized approach in Japan for such projects (Hongo 2016). \nIn  2013  there  were  amendments  to  the  PFI  Act,  allowing  for  a  public\u2013private \ninfrastructure fund to be established with public funds of \u00a510 billion to assist in certain \nmarket  risk-bearing  PFI/PPP  projects,  such  as  stand-alone-type  PFI  projects  and \nconcession-type  projects.  In  the  2017  update  to  the  PPP/PFI  Action  Plan  for  the  \n10-year period beginning in 2013, the government set a target amount of \u00a521 trillion  \nfor  PPP/PFIs  for  concession-style  projects  (i.e.,  projects  in  which  the  operating  \nrights  of government-owned  facilities  are  assigned  to  a  private  company,  and the \nprivate  company  recoups  its  investment  through  service  fees  and  tolls  charged).  \nThis was a significant increase on the initial PPP/PFI Action Plan targets of \u00a512 trillion \n($110 billion). The PPP/PFI Action Plan focuses on addressing the issues of aging \ninfrastructure, disaster prevention, and climate mitigation, and leveraging of stand-\nalone-type PFI/PPP projects not reliant on tax as a source of funding (Getting the Deal \nThrough [GTDT] 2018a). \n   \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 870  David and Venkatachalam \n \nOn the low-carbon sector front, the feed-in tariff (FIT) scheme introduced in 2012 made \ninvestments in renewable energy power generation projects more bankable, and as a \nresult  the  number  of  PPP  projects,  particularly  in  PV  power  generation  projects, \nincreased dramatically. However, the government reduced the pricing under the FIT \nscheme, and is reviewing the related framework to address over-concentration in the \nPV power generation market and to promote other sources, such as offshore wind \npower, biomass energy, and geothermal energy. While the FIT price is being modified \nannually, \u201cgreenfield projects\u201d in renewable power production are expected to continue \nto increase. The major challenge though for many renewable energy projects is that the \nmajority of them are small to medium in scale, and concession and stand-alone type \nprojects are usually suited to and target large-scale projects, which are actually limited \nin number.  \nOne reason PPPs have not taken off in Japan is the public facility-type PFI projects, \nwhich have relatively low project risks and therefore are also not attractive in terms of \nprofitability. Other reasons include regional projects that constitute the vast majority of \ndomestic PFI projects and many municipalities being inexperienced in PFI. Moreover, \nPPPs  are  not  incentivized  to  finance  public  projects;  on  the  contrary,  municipal  \nbonds are preferred as they are less expensive and have a less complicated structure \n(GTDT 2018b). \nThe interesting development in the Tokyo Stock Exchange has been the opening up  \nof the market for listed infrastructure funds investing in renewable energy projects  \nand concession projects. This is expected to boost the number PPPs in infrastructure \nprojects,  further  aided  by  the  development  of  a  secondary  market  for  domestic \ninfrastructure. Growth in this sector is also attracting alternative investors such as \ninstitutional investors, including insurance companies and the Government Pension \nInvestment  Fund,  which  manages  over  \u00a5140 trillion  ($1.2  trillion)  in  public  assets \n(GTDT 2018b). \n4.2  The Green Finance Organization \nIn Japan, the Green Fund commenced its operations in 2013. The Green Finance \nOrganization  (GFO),  which  controls  the  fund,  aims  to  support  local  community \ndevelopment  to  address  the  impacts  of  slow  economic  growth  and  an  aging \nsociety. The Green Fund is capitalized by the proceeds from the national Climate \nChange Countermeasure Tax, a carbon tax established in 2012 on petroleum and  \ncoal consumption. The Green Fund was established in response to the challenges \nassociated  with  financing  clean  energy  projects,  including  high  upfront  costs  for \ndevelopment and construction, as well as long operation and income phases that \nincrease project risks for project owners as well as developers.  \nThe Green Fund\u2019s objective has been to enhance the business case of small- to large-\nscale clean energy projects by making equity and mezzanine investments that attract \nfurther capital from private sources. Equity investments are limited to less than 50% of \nthe total equity amount (Figure 2), and in some cases a sub-fund is created that \naggregates equity investments from the GFO and other sponsors prior to funding the \nproject vehicle (Green Bank Network 2018). \n   \n9 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 870  David and Venkatachalam \n \nFigure 2: Funding Structure of the Japan Green Fund \n \n*Green Fund investment capped at half of the total equity amount. \nSource: Sueyoshi 2016. \nSince its inception in 2013 through to March 2017, the GFO, through the Green Fund, \nmade investment commitments of $110 million into projects with a total value of over \n$900 million, achieving a private source leverage ratio of over 10:1.

This includes, most notably, the Clean \nTechnology  Fund  (CTF),  the  Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF),  and  the  Clean \nDevelopment  Mechanism  (CDM)  created  by  the  Kyoto  Protocol.  Japan\u2019s  climate \nfinance is composed of the publicly financed Official Development Assistance (ODA), \nother  official  flows  (OOF),  and  private  investments.  Besides  these,  public\u2013private \nfinance (PPF) is assuming an ever greater importance. Public institutions such as the \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and Nippon Export and Investment \nInsurance  (NEXI),  provide  support  to  Japanese  companies  in  their  investments \noverseas, thus promoting private climate finance (PCF). In this regard, PPPs are key \ncomponents in the promotion of PCF. The ODA programs are coordinated by the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) (Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung e.V. 2017). \nFurthermore, in 2010 and 2011, Japan mobilized an amount of $3.8 billion in private \nclimate finance support (PCFS) to mitigate climate change in developing countries as \nthe  primary  or  secondary  goal.  PCFS  is  often  linked  to  programs  that  are  either  \nco-financed  by  Japanese  financial  institutions,  or  use  Japanese  technology  or \nexpertise. It is also tailored to the market conditions of recipient countries and has an \noverwhelming focus on climate change mitigation, rather than adaptation (Anbumozhi \nand Xao 2016). \nGiven  the  situation  of  the  domestic  project  finance  market  outlined  earlier,  many \nJapanese banks are also actively participating in offshore project finance transactions. \nIn particular, the Japanese government has adopted a policy to enhance assistance \nthrough ODA loans and export credit agency financing, aiming to achieve infrastructure \nexports to the tune of approximately \u00a530 trillion ($275.2 billion) in 2020 (GTDT 2018b). \nAccording to the Japanese government, Japanese infrastructure exports hit \u00a520 trillion \n($183.4  billion)  in  2015. This  initiative  continues  to  be  one  of the most  important \ngovernment policies in the infrastructure space, and it is anticipated that there will  \nbe  a  corresponding  increase  in  project  finance  transactions  related  to  renewable \ninfrastructure projects in developing countries like India. \n5.  TYPES OF PUBLIC\u2013PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS  \nAND GREEN INVESTMENT BANK INTERVENTIONS \nIN INDIA  \n5.1  Green Public\u2013Private Partnerships Investments \nIndia has seen a rapid increase in private investment in infrastructure since 2000. Its \nPPP  programs  grew  rapidly  during  2006  and  2012,  and  then  gradually  declined \n(Figures 3 and 4), both in terms of value and number of projects. In an assessment of \n19 economies in Asia and the Pacific by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU and ADB \n2015), India was considered a country with a \u201cdeveloped\u201d overall policy, regulatory, and \ninstitutional environment to attract private agents to public projects, along with the \nRepublic of Korea, Japan, and the Philippines. \n   \n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 870  David and Venkatachalam \n \nFigure 3 Annual Investments in PPPs in Infrastructure in India by Sector  \n(2005\u20132017*) \n \n*Data for 2017 only for the first half of the year. \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation using data from the World Bank Group (2017) Private Participation in \nInfrastructure Database. \nFigure 4: Annual Project Count of PPPs in Infrastructure in India by Sector  \n(2005\u20132017*) \n \n*Data for 2017 only for the first half of the year. \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculation using data from the World Bank Group (2017) Private Participation in \nInfrastructure Database. \nIndia  was  the  top  recipient  of  private  participation  in  infrastructure  (PPI)  activity  \nduring 2008\u20132012. India alone accounted for almost half of the investment in new  \nPPI projects in developing countries in 2011. This was the result of rapid opening  \nup  of  the  sector  and  policies  aimed  at  rapidly  developing  infrastructure,  as  well  \nas  regulatory  and  institutional  initiatives  undertaken  by  the  relevant  governmental \n12 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 870  David and Venkatachalam \n \ninstitutions. The establishment of the apex committee\u2014the Public Private Partnership \nAppraisal Committee\u2014with the adoption of standardized bidding documents helped in \ndramatically streamlining the appraisal and approval of infrastructure projects. \nAccording  to  the  PPI  database,  in  2015  PPI  investment  in  India  fell  for  the  fifth \nconsecutive  year,  hitting  a  10-year  low  at  $3.9  billion. While  the global  economic \nslowdown played a role in the slowdown of infrastructure investment through PPPs  \nin India, other major issues also contributed to the decline. On the domestic side,  \nPPPs were adversely affected by delays in land acquisition and clearances, shifting  \nof utilities, and right of way issues, leading to time and cost overruns. In addition,  \nthe private sector faced inadequate due diligence by project developers, as well as \nproject finance banks, resulting in many bank loans being rendered nonperforming \n(Figure 4). Moreover, Indian companies are currently saddled with debt and stretched \nbalance sheets, and are sitting on under-utilized capacity. Therefore, in the immediate \nfuture they are unlikely to increase capital expenditure on risky low-carbon projects \n(GTDT 2018c). \nPPP transactions in India have primarily been funded through commercial bank debt, \nwith  public  sector  undertaking  (PSU)  banks  leading  the  way.  Infrastructure  loans  \nwere a major contributor to the rising non-performing assets (NPAs) approved by the \nstate-owned  (PSU)  banks.  Further  capital  markets  were  inadequately  developed  \nand dominated by a safe asset class of quasi-government entities, leaving virtually  \nno appetite for infrastructure projects that were perceived as risky assets, while the \ngovernment  debts  were  increasing  rapidly,  reducing  the  fiscal  space  available  to \nfinance green infrastructure (Saha 2017). \nFigure 5: Non-Performing Loans and Gross Loans  \n(as combined fiscal deficit as % GDP) in India \n \nSource: National Accounts Statistics, MOSPI Government of India 2018. \nAlthough the government has been keen on resuscitating investments in infrastructure \nover 2018, there has only been some interest in project financing in the renewable \nenergy and transportation sectors, and most of this has been from the government or \nPSU banks (Figure 5). \n   \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 870  David and Venkatachalam \n \nNevertheless, the energy sector is taking in most of the foreign direct investment (FDI), \nparticularly in the solar sector, with the country overtaking the US to become the \nworld\u2019s second most attractive renewable energy market.

PPPs have relied heavily on commercial banks for \ndebt financing. Long-term financing exposes the banks to the risk of asset/liability \nmismatch; the main source of funds for Indian banks is savings deposits and term \ndeposits, with maturity profile ranging from less than 6 months to 5 years. Over much \nof the period, PPP project developers were comfortable with shorter rest periods. \nHowever, as the interest rate began to increase, concerns arose regarding the impact \non PPPs because the concessions contracts have no provisions for passing on higher \ninterest  rates.  Continued  increases  in  rates,  as  well  as  tightening  of  credit,  could  \nhave adverse effects on some green energy PPP projects. Key challenges include \novercoming the mismatch between long-term assets and short-term credit provision, as \nwell as the imperative for attracting additional flows of foreign public and private capital \n(United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2016).  \nOn the equity side, participation by foreign players, particularly strategic institutional \ninvestors, has been low, even though PPP projects in the sectors studied are allowed \nto have 100% FDI. Indeed, FDI accounted only for only 11% of total investment. \nEncouraging pure equity providers and institutional investors to invest will require more \nliberal norms in allowing them to participate at the time of bidding or enabling the latter \nto enter with a majority stake, as well as implementing projects that are highly profitable \nand allow for more risk sharing with the public counterpart. \n \n14 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 870  David and Venkatachalam \n \nFurther, governments, both central and state, need to develop mechanisms through \nwhich  non-banking  financial  institutes  could  also  provide  financing  for  low-carbon \nprojects. Unlike in Japan, the manufacturing of low-carbon energy and waste-to-energy \nequipment are not included in the concessional PPP guidelines in India. Manufacturing \nin low carbon or the Make in India campaign could play an important role in the \ntransformation of the energy sector to achieve NDC targets. Hence, in addition to direct \nlending by banks, lending by intermediate financial institutes and specialized banks \ncould benefit low-carbon projects. \n5.2  Green Investment Bank Interventions and Co-Investments \nTo generate 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022, and to reduce GHG emissions \nintensity by 33%\u201335% from 2005 levels by 2030 as part of India\u2019s NDC commitments, \nIndia has set ambitious goals for five key sectors: i) ground-mounted, large-scale solar, \nii) rooftop solar, iii) off-grid solar, iv) wind energy, and v) energy efficiency. India is part \nof  a  green  infrastructure  coalition  launched  in  December  2015  to  bring  together \ninvestors  with  strategic  interests  in  scaling  up  green  energy  infrastructure.  In  this \ncontext, GIBs as special purpose vehicles (SPVs) attain prominence. This is because \nGIBs are designed to address local market and policy failures. Based on international \nmodels, GIBs can provide financing solutions to grow India\u2019s clean energy market. Not \nall will be appropriate to the Indian context and actual opportunities will be determined \nthrough detailed market research. \nIn India, both a GIB and green bonds could support renewable energy projects by \nproviding broader access to domestic and foreign capital, as well as better financing \nterms,  including  lower  interest  rates  with  longer  lending  terms.  GIBs,  as  financial \ninstitutions,  typically  issue  bonds  to  raise  additional  capital  beyond  government  \ngrants, and to sell loans and recapitalize the balance sheet. The bonds issued by a  \nGIB  would,  by  definition,  be  green  bonds,  because  all  bank  capital  goes  toward  \nlow-carbon projects. \nWith a pledge to have cleaner energy sources accounting for 40% of total energy \ngeneration capacity by 2030, India will need to make tremendous efforts to achieve \nthese targets through competitive auctions. Indian banks have begun to rise to the \nchallenge in issuing green bonds overseas, which now include the Exim Bank, Yes \nBank, and IDBI Bank. However, to boost more investments, more incentives for the \nissuance of such bonds in the domestic market also have to be developed by the \nSecurities and Exchange Bureau of India (SEBI). With the Reserve Bank of India  \n(RBI) announcing renewables as a priority lending sector, many Indian banks will be \nobliged to discover ways of making green bonds work, especially in the context of \ndeveloping  low-carbon  infrastructure  and  allocating more  investments  to  their  loan \nportfolios. According to the RBI, total corporate bond issuances increased by 155% \nfrom Rs2.7 trillion in 2010\u201311 to Rs4.8 trillion in 2014\u201315, and the number of issuances \nincreased by 77% (RBI 2015). Yet the bond market in India is small compared to that of \nJapan, both in terms of volume and issuances. In Japan, bond markets accounted for \n16.2% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016 (Hongo 2018).  \n   \n15 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 870  David and Venkatachalam \n \nTo help meet the financing requirements of $2.5 trillion for the Paris target by 2030, \nSEBI proposed new norms for the issuance and listing of green bonds in 2016. The \nchallenge is the lack of a credit governance structure that would enable important \nproject  developers  such  as  local  governments  to  be  considered  creditworthy  and \ncapable  of  raising  funds  domestically  and  internationally  to  finance  low-carbon \ninfrastructure  projects.  GIBs  have  the  potential  to  link  these  new  stakeholders  to \nprojects,  and  attract  and  channel  international  capital  and  accelerate  domestic \ninvestment by leveraging limited public funds. GIBs will also intermediate and reduce \nrisks, resulting in abundant and affordable capital to scale up clean energy projects.  \n5.3  IREDA is the Ideal Candidate for a Green Investment Banks \nin India \nThe India Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA) was established in \n1987 to promote, develop, and extend financial assistance to renewable energy and \nenergy efficiency/conservation projects.

IREDA\u2019s financial services include direct project \nfinancing, equipment finance, business development finance, loans for manufacturing \nfacilities  of  energy  efficiency  equipment,  and  loans  to  banks  and  other  financing \ninstitutions for  on-lending. It  is funded  partly  through the central government,  and  \nalso receives funding from the German development bank (KfW), French development \nbank (AFD), Nordic Investment Bank (NIB), European Investment Bank (EIB), Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  World  Bank,  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB), and other international financial institutions. During 2006\u20132010, IREDA\u2019s total \nfunding grew by 70% from approximately $391 million\u2013$665 million. \nOne  of  IREDA\u2019s  important  functions  is  providing  low  interest-bearing  funds  and \nrefinance schemes to viable renewable energy projects based on capital from the \nNational Clean Energy Fund (NCEF). NCEF was established by the Government of \nIndia by levying a cess (tax) on coal produced in India as well as imported coal. The \nIREDA NCEF Refinance Scheme aims to bring down the cost of funds for renewable \nenergy projects by providing refinance at concessional rates of interest, with funds \nsourced from the NCEF. Besides its financial offerings, IREDA has also set up its own \nlow-carbon projects. IREDA floated its first green Masala bond in September 2017, \nmaking it the first green Masala bond to be listed on the London Stock Exchange \nInternational Securities Market (ISM). The five-year dated green Masala bond raised \napproximately $300 million (Rs19.5 billion) with a coupon of 7.125%). The green bond \nis certified by the Climate Bonds Initiative.

For  instance,  many  GIBs  use  credit \nenhancements  such  as  loan  loss  reserves  to  support  more  private  lending  on  \nbetter terms.  \nCurrently in India, credit enhancement schemes with entities such as the IDFC, Yes \nBank, and the IIFCL have been providing first loss partial credit guarantees for many \nrecently issued renewable energy bonds. However, there are still very few of these \ncredit enhancement tools in place. IREDA, as a GIB, can offer attractive financing \nterms that support clean energy because it can act as an independent, non-regulated \nentity that is capitalized with government \u201cgrants\u201d or contributions, rather than private \ninvestment capital.  \nHowever, for IREDA to be considered a full-fledged GIB, several key questions need to \nbe answered. Does IREDA have the institutional flexibility to provide flexible, low-cost \nlending activity at the level a GIB can? Does IREDA\u2019s legal status under the Reserve \nBank of India as a Regulated Non-Banking Financing Institution and fully owned by  \nthe central government prevent it from engaging in certain kinds of financing that GIBs \ncan otherwise provide? For example, can IREDA use the proceeds from the NCEF  \nto create a reserve to support more lending? Does IREDA\u2019s mandate and internal \nexpertise allow it to perform the market development and demand generation activities \nof  a  GIB?  How  are  its  on-lending  activities  with  other  banking  and  non-banking \ninstitutions structured and managed? \nNevertheless,  leveraging  the  financial  assets  and  lending  capability  of  the  IREDA  \nto increase green infrastructure projects would enable further channeling of finance \ntoward meeting the Paris climate target. Currently, IREDA is categorized as a sector-\nspecific development financial institution (DFI) and a non-banking financial institution, \nallowing it to make capital expenditure on new green products, approve modernization \nmeasures, and make power purchase agreements without government approval on \ndeals up to a limit of $80 million. A larger mandate as a GIB would allow it to harness \ndomestic bond markets, deploying international funding through such facilities as the \nGreen Climate Fund. In addition, currency swap and hedging could be undertaken by \nIREDA with other designated GIBs in Japan, Europe, and the US. This would allow it to \nissue credit guarantees and mobilize greater additional lines of finance to provide  \nlow-cost longer-term financing in India. Another crucial aspect would require IREDA to \nmake amendments in its operating guidelines to improve its performance, bringing it on \na par with other GIBs operating globally, including, but not limited to: (i) revision of the \nexisting lending guidelines for approval of projects eligible for financing under green \ninfrastructure; (ii) establishing monitoring, reporting, and verification procedures and \nprocesses  for  approved  projects;  (iii)  eliminating  barriers  that  have  prevented  the \nparticipation of other institutional and foreign investors.. \n6.

CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS  \nWhile  it  is  clear  that  many  emerging  economies,  such  as  India,  and  advanced \ncountries, such as Japan, are adopting innovative approaches to financing the clean \nenergy transition, it is equally clear that the potential to harness private capital through \nconcessional PPPs and GIBs is opportune. Experiences from the UK and Germany \nconfirm that investment and finance through such channels serve optimally to advance \nthe transition. \nIndia is committed to speeding up the transition through PPPs. For countries like \nJapan, banking is the focus of green financing efforts. However, in both the countries\u2019 \ncapital  markets,  institutional  investors,  such  as  insurance  and  pension  funds,  are  \nalso  considering  the  development  of  green  bonds  as  complimentary  to  PPP  and  \nGIB approaches. \nFollowing the ratification of the Paris agreement, emerging economies such as India \nare taking actions that will help accelerate investments in low-carbon infrastructure. \nWhile PPPs and GIBs differ in name, scope, and approach, they share the following \ncore characteristics: a mandate focusing mainly on mobilizing private investment using \ninterventions  to  mitigate  risks  and  enable  transactions;  innovative  transaction \nstructures and market expertise; independent authority; a focus on cost effectiveness \nand public\u2013private win-win. \nBoth concessional PPPs and GIBs can address investment gaps for projects with very \nlarge upfront capital costs, as well as gaps arising when lending costs are too high or \nwhen there is a limited source of public capital. GIBs also perform a de-risking role to \nmobilize the investment of private capital in low-carbon projects. Concessional PPPs \nand GIBs can also foster knowledge in the area in the case that country-level specialist \nexpertise  does  not  exist,  enabling  better  assessment  of  risks,  the  creation  and \nstandardization of innovative de-risking instruments, and then the diffusion of this new \nknowledge throughout the industry. PPPs, through co-financing large-scale projects, \nensure they \u201ccrowd in\u201d additional private finance. GIBs also take on the risky role of \nsupporting \u201cfirst or early mover\u201d projects, investing in technologies that need to be \ntested or scaled in the context of the local regulatory and financial environment. They \ncan also support new green technologies, new business models, or new entrants, such \nas a first-time developer or equipment supplier. \nKey areas with potential for enhancing Japan\u2013India cooperation in support of PPPs \nand GIBs include the following. \n\u2022  They can enable market education and capacity building for green PPPs and \nGIBs, building learning networks between Japanese and Indian stakeholders, \nwhich will play a key role in scaling up initiatives. It may be useful for institutions \nlike the JBIC to map the broad set of domestic policy initiatives and regulatory \nreforms that could be taken up by the emerging markets, taking India as a test \nbed. Such a roadmap building exercise could assess what works and where the \ngaps are, including overlaps and opportunities for further improving financial \nefficiency through knowledge sharing. \n   \n22 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 870  David and Venkatachalam \n \n\u2022  Many states in India are making the initial move into the green finance space \nthrough concessional PPP- and GIB-funded projects, but they are slowed by a \ngeneral lack of familiarity among the investors with the concept, definitions, \npurposes, legal framework and advantages of the approaches, and by a lack of \nadvisory services available in the area. Much could be done were a network of \nbanks  and  institutional  investors,  both  within  India  and  between  India  and \nJapan, to be established to build awareness and develop guiding materials \nbased on best cases. \n\u2022  Japan  and  India,  as  members  of  the  G20,  are  using  green  infrastructure \ninvestment as a means of coalition for engaging with overseas institutional \ninvestors.  Given  the  importance  of  concessional  PPPs  and  GIBs,  a  key \nchallenge is how to support green lending effectively to enable the securitization \nof those lending portfolios linked with a Monitoring Reporting and Verification \nSystem (MRV)  on  emission  reductions.  Japan\u2019s  technical  assistance  in  the \ndevelopment of an MRV and how best it could be used to support inbound FDI \nwill be critical. \nWhile the PPPs and GIBs recognize the importance of private capital, the nature of \ngreen  investments  in  India,  as  well  as  in  other  emerging  markets,  involves  a \ncombination of public and private finance. Hence it is also critical to learn lessons from \nJapan and other advanced economies on how to mobilize such blended finance in the \nmost efficient way to meet NDC targets. Many states in India have SPVs that are policy \ninfluenced or state owned, such as pension funds linked to state-owned enterprises. \nThese institutions could be a starting point in drawing a new roadmap and articulating \nthe policy, regulatory, and institutional development to foster green private finance \nthrough limited public finance. \n   \n23 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 870  David and Venkatachalam \n \nREFERENCES \nV.

To achieve the goals, governments need to make full use of private sector capacity to unlock much larger flows of private investment in low-carbon green infrastructure. We focus on two mechanisms: public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) and green investment banks (GIBs). PPPs are more practical for countries with robust demand, complemented by strong institutions and governance, protection of investments, and dispute resolution mechanisms. In contrast, the other options for green investments should use innovative transactions, risk-reduction structures, and market expertise. Although their common objective is to upscale low-carbon investment, both PPPs and GIBs have been established in a variety of national contexts to achieve a range of goals, including access to concessional capital at lower interest rates and longer tenures for green investments. We examine the rationale, mandates, and financing activities of these two categories of financial architecture within the context of India and Japan. We also provide stocktaking of the actual and potential use of these two approaches, and for strengthening bilateral cooperation between India and Japan.", "Title": "A Comparative Study on the Role of Public\u2013Private Partnerships and Green Investment Banks in Boosting Low-Carbon Investments"}}
