INTRODUCTION \n\nDavid and Venkatachalam \n\nFollowing  the  successful  climate  agreement  in  Paris  at  the  end  of  COP  21,  global \nattention  shifted  quickly  to  how  countries  will  achieve  their  nationally  determined \ncontributions  (NDCs).  Achieving  NDC  targets  requires  investments  in  a  range  of \ntechnologies, projects, and businesses in a variety of sectors, including energy supply \nand distribution. These investments, often termed \u201cgreen,\u201d are needed throughout the \ncycle  of  innovation  and  market  transformation,  from  research  and  development, \nthrough  demonstration,  deployment,  and  diffusion,  to  the  commercial  maturity  of \ntechnologies  and  infrastructure  projects.  Addressing  the  specific  sectoral  investment \nneeds  and  financing  the  transition  are  challenging  (Anbumozhi,  Kalirajan,  and  Kimua \n2018) as it involves several interrelated risks.  \n\nAccording  to  the  Climate  Policy  Initiative  (2017),  climate  finance  reached  a  peak  at \n$437 billion dollars in 2015 and then dropped to $383 billion in 2016, a 12% drop, but \nthe  real  issue  is  that  demand  for  finance  remains  far  below  estimates  of  what  is \nrequired.  Furthermore,  Treco  et  al.  (2018)  estimated  that  for  the  energy  sector, \nincluding  energy  efficiency  improvement  in  power,  transportation,  and  buildings  will \nrequire  a total  over  $1 trillion  per  year through to  2030  in the  emerging  economies  of \nAsia. It is encouraging to see increased private sector activity in the maturing markets \nfor  renewable  energy,  and  steady  public  financial  support  has  been  key,  but  funding \nremains  a  daunting  task.  The  expected  financing  needs  are  large:  A  review  of  NDCs \nand  other  policies  in  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN),  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  and  India,  which  represent  37%  of  global  greenhouse  \ngas  (GHG)  emissions,  finds  an  initial  investment  opportunity  of  $22.6  trillion  during \n2016\u20132030  in  key  energy  sectors  (Kumar,  Anizuzzaman,  and  Das  2017).  Although \nthese estimates refer to levels of investment, most of these resources are intended to \nflow  through  the  financial  sector  as  bank  lending,  project  financing,  institutional \ninvesting, or equity investing (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] and the \nWorld Bank Group 2017). \n\nThe  largest  climate  mitigation  sector,  energy  supply,  is  actually  expected  to  see  an \noverall  increase  of  $67  billion  in  investment  at  the  global  level.  In  total,  about \n$200\u00b0billion  in  additional  investment  needs  to  be  mobilized  annually.  This  does  not \ninclude  the  underlying  investment  requirements  that  various  sectors  would  normally \nneed  to  mobilize  for  development  regardless  of  Paris  agreement  commitments.  For \ninstance, in the power sector, when the underlying investment requirements are added \nto additional decarbonization costs, about $148 billion out of $432 billion is projected to \nbe  green  or  low  carbon,  such  as  for  renewables,  and  carbon  capture  and  storage.  \nIn  all,  70%  of  these  green  infrastructure  needs  will  be  in  emerging  markets  and \ndeveloping economies (Meltzer 2016). \n\nPublic  finance  and  international  official  development  assistance  can  and  will  play  a \ncritical role to jump start, leverage, and guide green investments, but transformational \nchange  will  inevitably  require  large-scale  private  financing.  This  is  because  most \ndeveloping countries have a low tax base, with limited ability of their citizens to pay for \nthe  services  provided  to  them,  and  the government  cannot  raise  the  necessary funds \nthrough taxation. \n\nHowever,  traditional  sources  of  private  financing  for  green  energy  infrastructure  also \nface  significant  financial,  regulatory,  and  structural  constraints.  Green  markets  are \nunable  to  garner  their  full  potential  due  to  issues  such  as  the  creditworthiness  and \nbankability of such projects. Moreover, many banks are reluctant to lend to the green \nenergy sector because many technologies in this sector are new and hence financiers \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 870 \n \n\nDavid and Venkatachalam \n\nconsider them risky (Anbumozhi and Rakhmah 2018). Especially in Asia, where banks \ndominate the financial markets and capital markets are tiny, this is a major challenge. \nThus,  there  is  a  critical  need  to  develop  new  financing  instruments  (Yoshino  and \nTaghizadeh-Hesary  2018).  In  such  cases,  governments,  although  risky  partners,  will \nbenefit from private sector participation through public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) and \ngreen  investment  banks  (GIBs).  Whether  private  capital  can  be  mobilized  to  support \ngreen  infrastructure  development  will  depend  on  the  risk  return  profile  of  the \ninvestments and the regulatory environment in which these investments operate. \n\nPPPs and GIBs can be understood as the intersection and alliance between public and \nprivate financial institutions to supply green finance jointly in a cost-effective way. While \nPPPs aim to provide public infrastructure service delivery through a mutually beneficial \npartnership,  GIBs  seek  to  leverage  private  finance  for  green  investments.  Therefore, \nthey  provide  frameworks  to  ensure  private  leadership  and  accountability  in  tackling \npublic good challenges, such as climate, while leveraging and enabling the ownership \nto  be  transferred  to  private  hands.  Moreover,  PPPs  and  GIBs  provide  countries  with \nlimited  public  finance  to  crowd  in  private  finance  to  supply  investment  needs.  In  this \nsituation,  efficient  and  effective  risk  allocation  is  crucial  to  increase  investment,  and \ninternational  cooperation  can  play  a  further  constructive  role,  providing  a  variety  of \nfunding,  technical  assistance,  and  guarantee  measures  for  green  infrastructure  \nprojects (Gardiner 2015). PPPs in effect allow for the transfer of investment risks to the \nprivate  sector  concerning  projects  that  are  traditionally  executed  or  financed  by  the \npublic sector.  \n\nThe  objective  of  this  paper  is  to  provide  policy  makers  with  a  comparative  review  of \nPPPs  and  GIBs,  and  the  associated  interventions  that  can  enable  risk  mitigation  or \nlower  transaction  costs.  Based  on  the  analysis,  it  proposes  a  framework  that  can  \nbe  used  to  identify  where  advanced  economies  like  Japan  can  support  emerging \neconomies like India in providing public\u2013private investments, and in the establishment \nand  funding  of  GIBs  when  investments  are  not  flowing  at  the  pace  and  on  the  scale \nrequired. This paper builds on the review of general trends in PPP investments, the rise \nof numerous GIBs, and detailed analysis of case studies that help contribute to a better \nunderstanding of these institutional mechanisms. \n\n2.  USING PUBLIC\u2013PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS  \n\nTO SCALE UP GREEN INVESTMENT \n\nAccording  to  the  Climate  Policy  Initiative  (2017),  private  sector  investment  has  taken \nthe  largest  share  in  climate  finance  over  recent  years  and  project  developers  have \nconsistently  being  driving  the  largest  volume  of  private  finance,  as  exemplified  in \nFigure 1. While the share of more traditional lenders in the green climate financing mix \nsignals a maturing technology market, more commercial finance institutions are taking \na  larger  role,  with  institutional  investment  growing  rapidly.  In  terms  of  public  sector \ninvestments,  in  2015  development  finance  institutions  accounted  for  the  majority  of \npublic flows, contributing 89% of the total public finance (Climate Policy Initiative 2017). \nThe  general  trend  suggests  the  need  for  dedicated  green  finance  institutions  to \nleverage  private  finance  that  can  help  close  the  funding  gap  for  many  low-carbon \ninvestments, especially in developing countries like India. \n\n \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 870 \n \n\nDavid and Venkatachalam \n\nFigure 1: Global Investment to Address Climate Change by Public  \nand Private Sector Investors 2012\u20132016 \n\nSource: Climate Policy Initiative 2017. \n\n \n\nAs  green  energy  projects  require  high  upfront  investment,  private  sector  capital, \ntechnology and innovation have often been routed through PPPs to supplement limited \npublic sector funding in providing such services.  \n\nThe real challenge for green technology and infrastructure projects is that they are very \nsimilar  to  other  infrastructure  projects,  and  therefore  should  rely  on  proven  project \nfinancing  approaches.  Infrastructure  projects  generally  face  significant  financing \nbarriers  due  to  high  upfront  capital  costs  and  long-term  payoffs,  which  increase  the \ncost  of  capital  and  reduce  its  availability.  High  transaction  costs,  a  lack  of  viable \nfunding models, and exposure to political risk are other barriers that increase the risk of \ninvesting in green infrastructure (Meltzer 2016). \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 870 \n \n\nDavid and Venkatachalam \n\nWith the private sector alone being unable to mitigate externalities and monetize, many \ngreen  investments  often  require  the  support  of  the  public  through  PPPs  and  GIBs. \nHowever,  these  two  forms  of  arrangement  still  need  to  exist  in  an  overarching  policy \nenvironment  that  provides  green  technologies  with  subsidy  support,  which  is  no \ndifferent  from  many  other  infrastructure  projects.  Such  hybrid  financing  schemes  are \nincreasingly  common  as  projects  become  more  complex  and  are  not  viable  purely \nbased  on  private  financing  structures.  Green  technologies  must  develop  an  equitable \nrisk  allocation  framework  that  can  provide  a  compelling  argument  for  different \nstakeholders  to  support  these  investments  through  subsidized  financing  to  the  extent \nthat this financing is justifiable from a public good perspective. \n\nMoreover,  the  successful  financial  closure  of  green  energy  projects  will  improve  their \ncontribution  to climate  change  by  locking  new  investments  into  clean  technology  over \ntheir  lifetime,  while  displacing  low-cost  polluting  alternatives.  This  is  significant  as \ncarbon mitigation initiatives often deal with emissions of pre-existing assets rather than \nintroducing new clean investments (Baietti 2013). \n\nConcessional PPP schemes have a particularly key role to play as a low-cost source of \nfinance,  which,  when  blended  with  other  sources  of  public  finance,  can  de-risk  green \ninfrastructure projects and crowd in private finance. Concessional PPPs are especially \nneeded in the early project preparation and construction phases of PPP infrastructure \nprojects,  when  the  risks  are  highest  and  capital  most  costly  and  scarce.  Once  green \nenergy projects commence operations and generate returns, the risks are reduced, and \nthese projects can be securitized and sold to institutional investors looking for low-risk \nand stable returns. The higher the risk, the more early-stage concessional green PPPs \ncan then be recycled into other green infrastructure projects. \n\nMoreover, the development of financial instruments such as green bonds can be linked \nto  PPP  projects  that  can  attract  institutional  investments  (Meltzer  2016).  With  PPPs, \nthe  spillover  effects  originally  created  for  energy  supplies  need  to  be  used,  and  tax \nrevenues  refunded  to  the  investors  in  energy  projects  (Yoshino  and  Taghizadeh-\nHesary  2017).  Thus,  a  well-designed  PPP  can  be  an  opportunity  to  scale  up  funding  \nfor  clean  energy  internationally  and  in  effect  contribute  to  the  battle  against  climate \nchange.  Although  the  potential  benefits  of  PPPs  are  many,  there  remain  challenges  \nfor  host  governments  and  various  partners  (including  the  private  sector,  bilateral \ndonors, and multilateral institutions) in the allocation of risks, as well as the sharing of \nrewards.  When  disputes  occur  between  the  private  sector  and  host  governments, \ninternational  financial  institutions  (IFIs)  can  play  an  important  role  in  resolving  these, \nand  help  ensure  the  fair  sharing  of  the  risks  and  the  rewards  of  the  PPP  for  all  the \nparties involved. \n\n3.  ROLE OF GREEN INVESTMENT BANKS IN \nBOOSTING LOW-CARBON INVESTMENTS \n\nGIBs,  as  public  or  semi-public  entities,  are  increasingly  being  used  to  facilitate  the \nattraction  of  private  capital  into  domestic  investments,  mainly  in  low-carbon  energy \ninfrastructure, which can help to meet NDC targets. These new institutions are publicly \nfunded  and  offer  preferential  rate  lending  to  finance  renewable  energy,  energy \nefficiency,  and  other  clean  energy  infrastructure  projects  in  partnership  with  private \nlenders.  Using  innovative  transaction  structures,  and  risk-reduction  and  transaction-\nenabling  techniques,  with  local  market  expertise,  GIBs  are  well  positioned  to  channel \nprivate investments into green projects. GIBs primarily leverage the impact of relatively \nlimited  public  resources.  As  of  2015,  13  national  and  sub-national  governments  have \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 870 \n \n\nDavid and Venkatachalam \n\ncreated  public  GIBs  or  similar  entities  (Table  1).  GIBs  and  similar  entities  have  been \nestablished  at  the  national  level  (Australia,  Japan,  Malaysia,  Switzerland,  the  United \nKingdom [UK]), the state level (California, Connecticut, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, \nand Rhode Island in the United States [US]), the county level (Montgomery County and \nMaryland  in  the  US),  and  the  city  level  (Masdar  in  the  United  Arab  Emirates  [UAE]) \n(OECD and Bloomberg Philanthropies 2015).  \n\nTable 1: Selected Examples of GIBs and GIB-like Entities and their Funding  \n\nOperational GIBs and \nGIB-like Entities \n\nConnecticut Green Bank \n\nLocation \n\nConnecticut, \nUS \n\nYear \nInstituted \n\n2011 \n\nFunding Sources \n\nRevenue from loans and emissions trading \nschemes, and utility bill surcharges, renewable \nportfolio standards, energy efficiency resource \nstandards \nAppropriations \n\nAustralia \n\n2012 \n\nUK \n\n2012 \n\nNational government funding \n\nJapan \nHawaii, US \n\n2013 \n2014 \n\nCarbon tax revenue \nBond issuance \n\nClean Energy Finance \nCorporation (CEFC) \nUK Green Investment \nBank \nGreen Fund  \nGreen Energy Market \nSecuritization (GEMS) \n(Hawaii Green \nInfrastructure Authority) \nNew Jersey Energy \nResilience Bank (ERB) \nNY Green Bank \n\nNew Jersey, US  2014 \n\nNational government funding \n\nNew York, US \n\n2014 \n\nRevenue from emissions trading schemes, utility \nbill surcharges, renewable portfolio standards, \nenergy efficiency resource and utility bill \nsurcharges, renewable portfolio standards, \nenergy efficiency resource standards, and \nreallocation of funds from existing programs \n\nSource: Adopted from OECD 2017. \n\nGIBs are, by virtue of their design, created to address local market and policy failures, \naiming  to  increase  private  sector  investment  in  domestic  low-carbon  infrastructure, \nleveraging the limited public capital. They are especially important for countries that do \nnot  have  national  development  banks  or  similar  entities  actively  promoting  private \ninvestment in domestic infrastructures that are deemed to be green. Even if dedicated \ninfrastructure and development banks do exist, governments can consider establishing \nGIBs  as  a  means  of  \u201cmainstreaming\u201d  green  investment  objectives  in  existing  national \ndevelopment  banks  to  mobilize  more  investment  in  support  of  clean  energy  and \ntechnology projects.  \n\nGIBs  are  created  not  only  to  meet  ambitious  emissions  targets,  but  also  to  support \nlocal community development, lower energy costs, develop green technology markets, \ncreate jobs,  and  lower  the  cost  of capital for green  infrastructure  projects (OECD  and \nBloomberg  Philanthropies  2015).  It  is  important to  use a range  of metrics  to measure \nand  track  the  performance  of  these  projects  to  keep  them  accountable  for  public \nmoney.  These  metrics  generally  focus  on  emissions  saved,  job  creation,  leverage \nratios (i.e.,  private  investment  mobilized  per  unit of  public  spending),  and  when  these \nbanks  are  required  to  be  profitable,  the  rate  of  return  is  also  included.  GIBs  adopt  a \ndifferent  approach  from  that  of  many  grant-making  public  institutions  and  follow  strict \nmandates to mobilize investment using limited public capital (Geddes et al. 2018). They \ncatalyze private financing for low-carbon technologies by using financial tools such as \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 870 \n \n\nDavid and Venkatachalam \n\nlong-term  and  low-interest  loans,  revolving  loan  funds,  insurance  products  (loan \nguarantees or loan loss reserves), green bonds, and low-cost public investment. When \na GIB uses public funds for financing, rather than grants or subsidies, the public funds \nare preserved through loan repayment. \n\nGIBs  are  essentially  mandated  to  provide  the  following  services:  (i)  attractive  and \nflexible  low-cost  financing  terms,  (ii)  credit  support,  (iii)  co-investment,  (iv)  standards, \n(v) increased supply of capital (NRDC and CEEW 2016). It is important to ensure that \nGIBs  do  not  to  replace  or  \u201ccrowd  out\u201d  commercial  banks  and  private  investors,  but \nactually  \u201ccrowd  in\u201d  private  capital.  They  can  play  a  transformative  role  as  they  are \nneither  a  traditional  government  program  with  limited  engagement  with  markets,  nor \nprivate entities weighed down by competitive pressures and fiduciary constraints, and \ntherefore are able to achieve their goals. \n\nThere  are  promising  examples,  wherein  governments,  cognizant  of  technical  and \nregulatory  barriers  and  opportunities  for  mobilizing  private  capital,  have  sometimes \nappointed state investment banks as GIBs to close financing gaps, such as the case of \nGermany\u2019s Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW). \n\nThe UK GIB was founded in 2012 in the same way, with public funding and the goal to \nassist the nation in transitioning toward a more sustainable economy by mobilizing the \nuse of private sector capital in low-carbon energy projects (UK Green Investment Bank \n2017).  It  was  set  up  as  an  independent  government-owned  entity,  capitalized  with  \n\u00a33 billion ($4.6 billion). It invests on terms similar to those of commercial banks and is \nrequired to meet a minimum 3.5% annual return on investments before tax (OECD and \nBloomberg Philanthropies 2015). To comply with European Union (EU) rules, approval \nfor  creation  of  the  GIB  was  given  provided  it  only  lent  to  projects  and  sectors  not \nconsidered  investable  by  private  or  commercial  funding.  This  provided  the  GIB  an \nadditional focus of crowding in private finance to such projects; essentially the private \nsector could leverage these public funds and risk mitigation instruments.  \n\nToday,  the  GIB  provides  a  wide  range  of  financial  instruments,  including  long-term \nfixed  market  rate  debt,  mezzanine  and  subordinated  debt,  and  equity  and  bridging \nequity  loans,  to  target  sectors  such  as  offshore  wind,  waste-to-energy,  bioenergy, \nenergy efficiency, and more recently, onshore wind.

While  originally  established  as  the \ncountry\u2019s  development  bank,  it  has  also  been  very  active  in  low-carbon  energy \nfinancing (KfW 2017). The KfW was founded in 1948 as Germany\u2019s reconstruction and \ndevelopment  bank  to  support  the  country\u2019s  development.  It  was  set  up  with  Marshall \nFunds  and  is  an  AAA-rated  institution  that  currently  raises  over  90%  of  its  funds  in \ncapital  markets  through  government-guaranteed  bonds.

Although  the  KfW  is  not \nexclusively  a  \u201cgreen\u201d  investment  bank,  it  is  mandated  to  support  Germany\u2019s  energy \ntransition  and  it  has  been  one  of  the  largest  development  bank  investors  in  clean \nenergy projects globally (Table 3). \n\nTable 3: KfW Key Figures of the Statement of Financial Position  \n\n \n\nTotal assets  \nVolume of lending  \nVolume of business  \nEquity \nEquity ratio  \n\nSource: KfW Annual Report 2016. \n\n31 December 2016  \n\u20ac billion  \n507.0 \n472.4 \n609.2 \n27.1 \n5.3% \n\n31 December 2015  \n\u20ac billion \n503.0 \n447.0 \n587.2 \n25.2 \n5.0% \n\nDuring 2012\u20132016, the KfW issued commitments with a total volume of \u20ac103 billion for \nprojects in connection with the energy transition, contributing to achieving the German \nFederal  Government\u2019s  Energy  Turnaround  Action  Plan,  and  attaining  the  nation\u2019s \nenvironmental  and  climate  goals  (KfW  2017).

TYPES OF PUBLIC\u2013PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS  \n\nAND GREEN INVESTMENT BANK INTERVENTIONS \nIN JAPAN \n\n4.1  Green Public\u2013Private Partnerships Investments \n\nPPPs have recently been promoted more aggressively by the Japanese government as \npart  of  its  economic  growth  and  stimulus  strategy.  The  high  costs  of  retrofitting  aging \npublic infrastructures, which were built during a high-growth period, in combination with \nfalling  fees  and  populations,  have  pushed  local  governments  to  look  for  alternative \nways  of  financing  and  maintaining  public  assets.  Renewable  energy,  public  sewage \nfacilities,  and  waste  treatment  plants  and  projects  form  the  largest  class  of  public \ninfrastructure,  with  more  than  3,600  public  enterprises  operating  in  the  country.  In \nMarch  2016,  the  total  number  of  PPP  projects,  also  known  as  the  private  finance \ninitiative (PFI), totaled 527. These arrangements cover the operation and management \nof  public facilities  in  the energy,  water,  and  waste  sectors,  as  well  as  cultural  centers \nand  medical  facilities. Waste-to-energy  projects  have  attracted  considerable  financing \nthrough the PFI.  \n\nAlthough  many  cities  have  introduced  power  generation  at  waste  incineration  plants, \nthey  are  not  financially  viable  in  terms  of  making  the  necessary  large-scale \ninvestments. The  case  of  Yokote  is  interesting  as  the  city  is  located  in  an  agricultural \narea with a population of only 100,000. After evaluating the costs of different business \nmodels,  including  the  conventional  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction  \n(EPC)  model,  and  the  design,  build,  and  operate  (DBO)  model,  the  city  chose  the  \nlatter.  The  city  offered  a  tender  and  concluded  contracts  with  a  private  consortium  \nfor  construction,  operation,  and  management  amounting  to  \u00a58,267  million  and  \n\u00a57,070  million,  respectively,  over  20  years.  The  city  prepared  the  funding  for  the \nconstruction  of  the  plant  using  the  Special  Bond  for  Municipality  Amalgamation,  \nwith  about  70%  of  the  principal  and  interest  payment  shouldered  by  the  national \ngovernment  and  a  government  subsidy  program  for  promoting  investments  that \ncontribute to the circular economy. More than three-quarters of capital expenditure was \ndirectly  or  indirectly  paid  by  the  national  government.  The  DBO  model  is  now  a \nstandardized approach in Japan for such projects (Hongo 2016). \n\nIn  2013  there  were  amendments  to  the  PFI  Act,  allowing  for  a  public\u2013private \ninfrastructure fund to be established with public funds of \u00a510 billion to assist in certain \nmarket  risk-bearing  PFI/PPP  projects,  such  as  stand-alone-type  PFI  projects  and \nconcession-type  projects.  In  the  2017  update  to  the  PPP/PFI  Action  Plan  for  the  \n10-year  period  beginning  in  2013,  the  government  set  a  target  amount  of  \u00a521  trillion  \nfor  PPP/PFIs  for  concession-style  projects  (i.e.,  projects  in  which  the  operating  \nrights  of  government-owned  facilities  are  assigned  to  a  private  company,  and  the \nprivate  company  recoups  its  investment  through  service  fees  and  tolls  charged).  \nThis was a significant increase on the initial PPP/PFI Action Plan targets of \u00a512 trillion \n($110  billion).  The  PPP/PFI  Action  Plan  focuses  on  addressing  the  issues  of  aging \ninfrastructure,  disaster  prevention,  and  climate  mitigation,  and  leveraging  of  stand-\nalone-type PFI/PPP projects not reliant on tax as a source of funding (Getting the Deal \nThrough [GTDT] 2018a). \n\n \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 870 \n \n\nDavid and Venkatachalam \n\nOn the low-carbon sector front, the feed-in tariff (FIT) scheme introduced in 2012 made \ninvestments in renewable energy power generation projects more bankable, and as a \nresult  the  number  of  PPP  projects,  particularly  in  PV  power  generation  projects, \nincreased  dramatically.  However,  the  government  reduced  the  pricing  under  the  FIT \nscheme,  and  is  reviewing  the  related  framework  to  address  over-concentration  in  the \nPV  power  generation  market  and  to  promote  other  sources,  such  as  offshore  wind \npower, biomass energy, and geothermal energy. While the FIT price is being modified \nannually, \u201cgreenfield projects\u201d in renewable power production are expected to continue \nto increase. The major challenge though for many renewable energy projects is that the \nmajority  of  them  are  small  to  medium  in  scale,  and  concession  and  stand-alone  type \nprojects are usually suited to and target large-scale projects, which are actually limited \nin number.  \n\nOne  reason  PPPs  have  not  taken  off  in  Japan  is  the  public  facility-type  PFI  projects, \nwhich have relatively low project risks and therefore are also not attractive in terms of \nprofitability. Other reasons include regional projects that constitute the vast majority of \ndomestic  PFI  projects  and many municipalities being  inexperienced  in PFI.  Moreover, \nPPPs  are  not  incentivized  to  finance  public  projects;  on  the  contrary,  municipal  \nbonds are preferred as they are less expensive and have a less complicated structure \n(GTDT 2018b). \n\nThe  interesting  development  in  the  Tokyo  Stock  Exchange  has  been  the  opening  up  \nof  the  market  for  listed  infrastructure  funds  investing  in  renewable  energy  projects  \nand concession projects. This is expected to boost the number PPPs in infrastructure \nprojects,  further  aided  by  the  development  of  a  secondary  market  for  domestic \ninfrastructure.  Growth  in  this  sector  is  also  attracting  alternative  investors  such  as \ninstitutional  investors,  including  insurance  companies  and  the  Government  Pension \nInvestment  Fund,  which  manages  over  \u00a5140 trillion  ($1.2  trillion)  in  public  assets \n(GTDT 2018b). \n\n4.2  The Green Finance Organization \n\nIn  Japan,  the  Green  Fund  commenced  its  operations  in  2013.  The  Green  Finance \nOrganization  (GFO),  which  controls  the  fund,  aims  to  support  local  community \ndevelopment  to  address  the  impacts  of  slow  economic  growth  and  an  aging \nsociety. The  Green  Fund  is  capitalized  by  the  proceeds  from  the  national  Climate \nChange  Countermeasure  Tax,  a  carbon  tax  established  in  2012  on petroleum  and  \ncoal  consumption.  The  Green  Fund  was  established  in  response  to  the  challenges \nassociated  with  financing  clean  energy  projects,  including  high  upfront  costs  for \ndevelopment  and  construction,  as  well  as  long  operation  and  income  phases  that \nincrease project risks for project owners as well as developers.  \n\nThe Green Fund\u2019s objective has been to enhance the business case of small- to large-\nscale  clean  energy  projects  by making  equity  and  mezzanine  investments  that  attract \nfurther capital from private sources. Equity investments are limited to less than 50% of \nthe  total  equity  amount  (Figure  2),  and  in  some  cases  a  sub-fund  is  created  that \naggregates  equity  investments  from  the  GFO  and  other  sponsors  prior  to  funding  the \nproject vehicle (Green Bank Network 2018). \n\n \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 870 \n \n\nDavid and Venkatachalam \n\nFigure 2: Funding Structure of the Japan Green Fund \n\n*Green Fund investment capped at half of the total equity amount. \n\nSource: Sueyoshi 2016. \n\n \n\nSince its inception in 2013 through to March 2017, the GFO, through the Green Fund, \nmade  investment  commitments  of  $110  million  into  projects  with  a  total  value  of  over \n$900  million,  achieving  a  private  source  leverage  ratio  of  over  10:1. Table  4  provides \ndetails  of  the  projects  invested  in  by  the  Green  Fund  during  2013\u20132015.

This  includes,  most  notably,  the  Clean \nTechnology  Fund  (CTF),  the  Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF),  and  the  Clean \nDevelopment  Mechanism  (CDM)  created  by  the  Kyoto  Protocol.  Japan\u2019s  climate \nfinance  is  composed  of  the  publicly  financed  Official  Development  Assistance  (ODA), \nother  official  flows  (OOF),  and  private  investments.  Besides  these,  public\u2013private \nfinance (PPF) is assuming an ever greater importance. Public institutions such as the \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  and  Nippon  Export  and  Investment \nInsurance  (NEXI),  provide  support  to  Japanese  companies  in  their  investments \noverseas,  thus  promoting  private  climate  finance  (PCF).  In  this  regard,  PPPs  are  key \ncomponents  in  the  promotion  of  PCF.  The  ODA  programs  are  coordinated  by  the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) (Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung e.V. 2017). \n\nFurthermore,  in  2010  and  2011,  Japan  mobilized  an  amount  of  $3.8  billion  in  private \nclimate finance  support (PCFS) to  mitigate  climate change  in  developing  countries  as \nthe  primary  or  secondary  goal.  PCFS  is  often  linked  to  programs  that  are  either  \nco-financed  by  Japanese  financial  institutions,  or  use  Japanese  technology  or \nexpertise. It is also tailored to the market conditions of recipient countries and has an \noverwhelming focus  on climate  change mitigation,  rather than  adaptation  (Anbumozhi \nand Xao 2016). \n\nGiven  the  situation  of  the  domestic  project  finance  market  outlined  earlier,  many \nJapanese banks are also actively participating in offshore project finance transactions. \nIn  particular,  the  Japanese  government  has  adopted  a  policy  to  enhance  assistance \nthrough ODA loans and export credit agency financing, aiming to achieve infrastructure \nexports to the tune of approximately \u00a530 trillion ($275.2 billion) in 2020 (GTDT 2018b). \nAccording to the Japanese government, Japanese infrastructure exports hit \u00a520 trillion \n($183.4  billion)  in  2015.  This  initiative  continues  to  be  one  of  the  most  important \ngovernment  policies  in  the  infrastructure  space,  and  it  is  anticipated  that  there  will  \nbe  a  corresponding  increase  in  project  finance  transactions  related  to  renewable \ninfrastructure projects in developing countries like India. \n\n5.  TYPES OF PUBLIC\u2013PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS  \n\nAND GREEN INVESTMENT BANK INTERVENTIONS \nIN INDIA  \n\n5.1  Green Public\u2013Private Partnerships Investments \n\nIndia  has  seen  a  rapid  increase  in  private  investment  in  infrastructure  since  2000.  Its \nPPP  programs  grew  rapidly  during  2006  and  2012,  and  then  gradually  declined \n(Figures 3 and 4), both in terms of value and number of projects. In an assessment of \n19 economies in Asia and the Pacific by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU and ADB \n2015), India was considered a country with a \u201cdeveloped\u201d overall policy, regulatory, and \ninstitutional  environment  to  attract  private  agents  to  public  projects,  along  with  the \nRepublic of Korea, Japan, and the Philippines. \n\n \n\n \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 870 \n \n\nDavid and Venkatachalam \n\nFigure 3 Annual Investments in PPPs in Infrastructure in India by Sector  \n(2005\u20132017*) \n\n*Data for 2017 only for the first half of the year. \n\nSource:  Authors\u2019  calculation  using  data  from  the  World  Bank  Group  (2017)  Private  Participation  in \nInfrastructure Database. \n\nFigure 4: Annual Project Count of PPPs in Infrastructure in India by Sector  \n(2005\u20132017*) \n\n \n\n \n\n*Data for 2017 only for the first half of the year. \n\nSource:  Authors\u2019  calculation  using  data  from  the  World  Bank  Group  (2017)  Private  Participation  in \nInfrastructure Database. \n\nIndia  was  the  top  recipient  of  private  participation  in  infrastructure  (PPI)  activity  \nduring  2008\u20132012.  India  alone  accounted  for  almost  half  of  the  investment  in  new  \nPPI  projects  in  developing  countries  in  2011.  This  was  the  result  of  rapid  opening  \nup  of  the  sector  and  policies  aimed  at  rapidly  developing  infrastructure,  as  well  \nas  regulatory  and  institutional  initiatives  undertaken  by  the  relevant  governmental \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 870 \n \n\nDavid and Venkatachalam \n\ninstitutions. The  establishment  of  the  apex  committee\u2014the  Public  Private  Partnership \nAppraisal Committee\u2014with the adoption of standardized bidding documents helped in \ndramatically streamlining the appraisal and approval of infrastructure projects. \n\nAccording  to  the  PPI  database,  in  2015  PPI  investment  in  India  fell  for  the  fifth \nconsecutive  year,  hitting  a  10-year  low  at  $3.9  billion.  While  the  global  economic \nslowdown  played  a  role  in  the  slowdown  of  infrastructure  investment  through  PPPs  \nin  India,  other  major  issues  also  contributed  to  the  decline.  On  the  domestic  side,  \nPPPs  were  adversely  affected  by  delays  in  land  acquisition  and  clearances,  shifting  \nof  utilities,  and  right  of  way  issues,  leading  to  time  and  cost  overruns.  In  addition,  \nthe  private  sector  faced  inadequate  due  diligence  by  project  developers,  as  well  as \nproject  finance  banks,  resulting  in  many  bank  loans  being  rendered  nonperforming \n(Figure 4). Moreover, Indian companies are currently saddled with debt and stretched \nbalance sheets, and are sitting on under-utilized capacity. Therefore, in the immediate \nfuture  they  are  unlikely  to  increase  capital  expenditure  on  risky  low-carbon  projects \n(GTDT 2018c). \n\nPPP  transactions  in  India  have  primarily  been  funded  through  commercial  bank  debt, \nwith  public  sector  undertaking  (PSU)  banks  leading  the  way.  Infrastructure  loans  \nwere  a  major  contributor  to  the  rising  non-performing  assets  (NPAs)  approved  by  the \nstate-owned  (PSU)  banks.  Further  capital  markets  were  inadequately  developed  \nand  dominated  by  a  safe  asset  class  of  quasi-government  entities,  leaving  virtually  \nno  appetite  for  infrastructure  projects  that  were  perceived  as  risky  assets,  while  the \ngovernment  debts  were  increasing  rapidly,  reducing  the  fiscal  space  available  to \nfinance green infrastructure (Saha 2017). \n\nFigure 5: Non-Performing Loans and Gross Loans  \n(as combined fiscal deficit as % GDP) in India \n\nSource: National Accounts Statistics, MOSPI Government of India 2018. \n\n \n\nAlthough the government has been keen on resuscitating investments in infrastructure \nover  2018,  there  has  only  been  some  interest  in  project  financing  in  the  renewable \nenergy and transportation sectors, and most of this has been from the government or \nPSU banks (Figure 5). \n\n \n\n \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 870 \n \n\nDavid and Venkatachalam \n\nNevertheless, the energy sector is taking in most of the foreign direct investment (FDI), \nparticularly  in  the  solar  sector,  with  the  country  overtaking  the  US  to  become  the \nworld\u2019s second most attractive renewable energy market. As of March 2017, India had \na combined renewable energy capacity of 57 GW, and it hopes to grow that to 175 GW \nby 2022. Most of this is expected in solar, which also saw a significant drop in tariffs in \n2017.

PPPs have relied heavily on commercial banks for \ndebt  financing.  Long-term  financing  exposes  the  banks  to  the  risk  of  asset/liability \nmismatch;  the  main  source  of  funds  for  Indian  banks  is  savings  deposits  and  term \ndeposits, with maturity profile ranging from less than 6 months to 5 years. Over much \nof  the  period,  PPP  project  developers  were  comfortable  with  shorter  rest  periods. \nHowever, as the interest rate began to increase, concerns arose regarding the impact \non PPPs because the concessions contracts have no provisions for passing on higher \ninterest  rates.  Continued  increases  in  rates,  as  well  as  tightening  of  credit,  could  \nhave  adverse  effects  on  some  green  energy  PPP  projects.  Key  challenges  include \novercoming the mismatch between long-term assets and short-term credit provision, as \nwell as the imperative for attracting additional flows of foreign public and private capital \n(United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2016).  \n\nOn  the  equity  side,  participation  by  foreign  players,  particularly  strategic  institutional \ninvestors, has been low, even though PPP projects in the sectors studied are allowed \nto  have  100%  FDI.  Indeed,  FDI  accounted  only  for  only  11%  of  total  investment. \nEncouraging pure equity providers and institutional investors to invest will require more \nliberal norms in allowing them to participate at the time of bidding or enabling the latter \nto enter with a majority stake, as well as implementing projects that are highly profitable \nand allow for more risk sharing with the public counterpart. \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 870 \n \n\nDavid and Venkatachalam \n\nFurther,  governments,  both  central  and  state,  need  to  develop  mechanisms  through \nwhich  non-banking  financial  institutes  could  also  provide  financing  for  low-carbon \nprojects. Unlike in Japan, the manufacturing of low-carbon energy and waste-to-energy \nequipment are not included in the concessional PPP guidelines in India. Manufacturing \nin  low  carbon  or  the  Make  in  India  campaign  could  play  an  important  role  in  the \ntransformation of the energy sector to achieve NDC targets. Hence, in addition to direct \nlending  by  banks,  lending  by  intermediate  financial  institutes  and  specialized  banks \ncould benefit low-carbon projects. \n\n5.2  Green Investment Bank Interventions and Co-Investments \n\nTo  generate  175  GW  of  renewable  energy  by  2022,  and  to  reduce  GHG  emissions \nintensity by 33%\u201335% from 2005 levels by 2030 as part of India\u2019s NDC commitments, \nIndia has set ambitious goals for five key sectors: i) ground-mounted, large-scale solar, \nii) rooftop solar, iii) off-grid solar, iv) wind energy, and v) energy efficiency. India is part \nof  a  green  infrastructure  coalition  launched  in  December  2015  to  bring  together \ninvestors  with  strategic  interests  in  scaling  up  green  energy  infrastructure.  In  this \ncontext, GIBs as special purpose vehicles (SPVs) attain prominence. This is because \nGIBs are designed to address local market and policy failures. Based on international \nmodels, GIBs can provide financing solutions to grow India\u2019s clean energy market. Not \nall will be appropriate to the Indian context and actual opportunities will be determined \nthrough detailed market research. \n\nIn  India,  both  a  GIB  and  green  bonds  could  support  renewable  energy  projects  by \nproviding  broader  access  to  domestic  and  foreign  capital,  as  well  as  better  financing \nterms,  including  lower  interest  rates  with  longer  lending  terms.  GIBs,  as  financial \ninstitutions,  typically  issue  bonds  to  raise  additional  capital  beyond  government  \ngrants,  and  to  sell  loans  and  recapitalize  the  balance  sheet.  The  bonds  issued  by  a  \nGIB  would,  by  definition,  be  green  bonds,  because  all  bank  capital  goes  toward  \nlow-carbon projects. \n\nWith  a  pledge  to  have  cleaner  energy  sources  accounting  for  40%  of  total  energy \ngeneration  capacity  by  2030,  India  will  need  to  make  tremendous  efforts  to  achieve \nthese  targets  through  competitive  auctions.  Indian  banks  have  begun  to  rise  to  the \nchallenge  in  issuing  green  bonds  overseas,  which  now  include  the  Exim  Bank,  Yes \nBank,  and  IDBI  Bank.  However,  to  boost  more  investments,  more  incentives  for  the \nissuance  of  such  bonds  in  the  domestic  market  also  have  to  be  developed  by  the \nSecurities  and  Exchange  Bureau  of  India  (SEBI).  With  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  \n(RBI)  announcing  renewables  as  a  priority  lending  sector,  many  Indian  banks  will  be \nobliged  to  discover  ways  of  making  green  bonds  work,  especially  in  the  context  of \ndeveloping  low-carbon  infrastructure  and  allocating  more  investments  to  their  loan \nportfolios.  According  to  the  RBI,  total  corporate  bond  issuances  increased  by  155% \nfrom Rs2.7 trillion in 2010\u201311 to Rs4.8 trillion in 2014\u201315, and the number of issuances \nincreased by 77% (RBI 2015). Yet the bond market in India is small compared to that of \nJapan, both in terms of volume and issuances. In Japan, bond markets accounted for \n16.2% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016 (Hongo 2018).  \n\n \n\n \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 870 \n \n\nDavid and Venkatachalam \n\nTo  help  meet  the  financing  requirements  of  $2.5  trillion  for  the  Paris  target  by  2030, \nSEBI  proposed  new  norms  for  the  issuance  and  listing  of  green  bonds  in  2016.  The \nchallenge  is  the  lack  of  a  credit  governance  structure  that  would  enable  important \nproject  developers  such  as  local  governments  to  be  considered  creditworthy  and \ncapable  of  raising  funds  domestically  and  internationally  to  finance  low-carbon \ninfrastructure  projects.  GIBs  have  the  potential  to  link  these  new  stakeholders  to \nprojects,  and  attract  and  channel  international  capital  and  accelerate  domestic \ninvestment  by  leveraging  limited  public  funds.  GIBs  will  also  intermediate  and  reduce \nrisks, resulting in abundant and affordable capital to scale up clean energy projects.  \n\n5.3  IREDA is the Ideal Candidate for a Green Investment Banks \n\nin India \n\nThe India Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA) was established in \n1987  to  promote,  develop,  and  extend  financial  assistance  to  renewable  energy  and \nenergy efficiency/conservation projects. It is a public financial institution and registered \nas a non-banking financial institution. IREDA\u2019s financial services include direct project \nfinancing,  equipment  finance,  business  development  finance,  loans  for  manufacturing \nfacilities  of  energy  efficiency  equipment,  and  loans  to  banks  and  other  financing \ninstitutions  for  on-lending.  It  is  funded  partly  through  the  central  government,  and  \nalso receives funding from the German development bank (KfW), French development \nbank  (AFD),  Nordic  Investment  Bank  (NIB),  European  Investment  Bank  (EIB),  Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  World  Bank,  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB),  and  other  international  financial  institutions.  During  2006\u20132010,  IREDA\u2019s  total \nfunding grew by 70% from approximately $391 million\u2013$665 million. \n\nOne  of  IREDA\u2019s  important  functions  is  providing  low  interest-bearing  funds  and \nrefinance  schemes  to  viable  renewable  energy  projects  based  on  capital  from  the \nNational  Clean  Energy  Fund  (NCEF).  NCEF  was  established  by  the  Government  of \nIndia  by  levying  a  cess (tax)  on  coal  produced  in  India  as  well  as  imported  coal. The \nIREDA  NCEF  Refinance  Scheme  aims to  bring down  the  cost  of funds for renewable \nenergy  projects  by  providing  refinance  at  concessional  rates  of  interest,  with  funds \nsourced from the NCEF. Besides its financial offerings, IREDA has also set up its own \nlow-carbon  projects.  IREDA  floated  its  first  green  Masala  bond  in  September  2017, \nmaking  it  the  first  green  Masala  bond  to  be  listed  on  the  London  Stock  Exchange \nInternational  Securities  Market  (ISM).  The  five-year  dated  green  Masala  bond  raised \napproximately $300 million (Rs19.5 billion) with a coupon of 7.125%). The green bond \nis  certified  by  the  Climate  Bonds  Initiative.  After  IREDA  floated  its  first  international \nmasala bond on the London Stock Exchange, it also filed a draft red herring prospectus \nfor  an  initial  public  offering  (IPO)  in  December  2017.  The  company  plans  to  issue  \n139 million fresh shares through the IPO. \n\nThe lending model of IREDA is illustrated in Figure 6, which outlines its structure and \nlending activity, and its source of funds. \n\n \n\n \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 870 \n \n\nDavid and Venkatachalam \n\nFigure 6: IREDA Lending Model \n\nSource:  Developed  by  the  authors  based  on  information  available  in  the  IREDA  2016\u20132017  Annual  Report  and  at \nwww.ireda.gov.in  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 870 \n \n\nDavid and Venkatachalam \n\nTable 6: IREDA Resources, Operational Details, and Sector-Wise Disbursements  \n\nIREDA Resources for 2012\u20132017 (Rs billion) \n\nIREDA Operational Details for 2012\u20132017 (Rs billion) \n\nResources \n\nEquity Capital \nReserves and Surplus \nInternational Assistance \nDomestic Borrowings \nTotal \n\nOperations \n\nLoan Sanction \nLoan Disbursement \nRepayment of Borrowers \nNet Outstanding Loans (IREDA) \n\nWorking Results \n\nTotal Income \nProfit before Tax \nProfit after Tax \nEPS in Rs (Earnings per Share)  330.90 \n\nSource: IREDA 2016\u20132017 Annual Report. \n\n2012\u2013\n2013 \n6.996 \n9.888 \n37.940 \n14.062 \n68.885 \n\n2012\u2013\n2013 \n37.474 \n21.255 \n4.368 \n64.769 \n\n2012\u2013\n2013 \n7.296 \n2.506 \n2.027 \n\n2013\u2013\n2014 \n7.446 \n12.883 \n41.417 \n26.138 \n87.883 \n\n2013\u2013\n2014 \n38.184 \n24.711 \n8.910 \n81.900 \n\n2013\u2013\n2014 \n8.954 \n3.403 \n2.405 \n\n2014\u2013\n2015 \n7.846 \n13.940 \n47.603 \n26.789 \n96.177 \n\n2015\u2013\n2016 \n7.846 \n15.115 \n55.529 \n44.516 \n123.005 \n\n2016\u2013\n2017 \n7.846 \n17.254 \n78.716 \n51.772 \n155.588 \n\n2014\u2013\n2015 \n45.488 \n26.195 \n19.630 \n88.035 \n\n2014\u2013\n2015 \n11.184 \n3.786 \n2.719 \n\n2015\u2013\n2016 \n78.065 \n42.574 \n27.698 \n102.017 \n\n2015\u2013\n2016 \n11.745 \n4.176 \n2.980 \n\n2016\u2013\n2017 \n101.990 \n65.935 \n33.704 \n133.368 \n\n2016\u2013\n2017 \n14.817 \n5.282 \n3.650 \n\n327.29 \n\n355.05 \n\n379.86 \n\n465.22 \n\nIREDA Sector-Wise Sanctions and Disbursements FY 2016\u20132017 (Rs billion) \n\nSectors \n\nWind Power \nSolar Energy \nShort-Term Loan \nHydro Power \nBiomass & Co-Generation \nBridging Loan against GBI/Capital \nSubsidy to channel partners and \nloans against pending energy bills \nEnergy Efficiency and Conservation \nMiscellaneous (Biomass Gasification \n+ NCEF) \nTotal \n\nSanctions \n(Rs billion) \n\nDisbursements* \n(Rs billion) \n\n24.605 \n48.304 \n20.400 \n3.297 \n1.464 \n0.352 \n\n2.950 \n0.618 \n\n% \n24.12 \n47.36 \n20.00 \n3.23 \n1.44 \n0.35 \n\n2.89 \n0.61 \n\n25.356 \n15.240 \n20.050 \n3.409 \n0.868 \n0.505 \n\n0.066 \n0.440 \n\n% \n38.4 \n23.11 \n30.41 \n5.17 \n1.32 \n0.76 \n\n0.10 \n0.67 \n\n101.990 \n\n100.00 \n\n65.935 \n\n100.00 \n\n*Amounts of disbursements include the projects sanctioned during the financial year 2016\u20132017 and previous years. \nSource: IREDA 2016\u201317 Annual Report. \n\n \n\n \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 870 \n \n\nDavid and Venkatachalam \n\nIn  addition  to  offering  lower  rates  and  longer  terms,  GIBs  such  as  IREDA  may  cover \n100%  of  the  project  cost,  but  more  commonly  use  co-lending  or  risk  mitigation \nstrategies  to  bring  in  private  investment.  For  instance,  many  GIBs  use  credit \nenhancements  such  as  loan  loss  reserves  to  support  more  private  lending  on  \nbetter terms.  \n\nCurrently  in  India,  credit  enhancement  schemes  with  entities  such  as  the  IDFC,  Yes \nBank,  and  the  IIFCL  have  been  providing  first  loss  partial  credit  guarantees  for  many \nrecently  issued  renewable  energy  bonds.  However,  there  are  still  very  few  of  these \ncredit  enhancement  tools  in  place.  IREDA,  as  a  GIB,  can  offer  attractive  financing \nterms that support clean energy because it can act as an independent, non-regulated \nentity  that  is  capitalized  with  government  \u201cgrants\u201d  or  contributions,  rather  than  private \ninvestment capital.  \n\nHowever, for IREDA to be considered a full-fledged GIB, several key questions need to \nbe answered. Does IREDA have the institutional flexibility to provide flexible, low-cost \nlending activity at the level a GIB can? Does IREDA\u2019s legal status under the Reserve \nBank  of  India  as  a  Regulated  Non-Banking  Financing  Institution  and  fully  owned  by  \nthe central government prevent it from engaging in certain kinds of financing that GIBs \ncan  otherwise  provide?  For  example,  can  IREDA  use  the  proceeds  from  the  NCEF  \nto  create  a  reserve  to  support  more  lending?  Does  IREDA\u2019s  mandate  and  internal \nexpertise allow it to perform the market development and demand generation activities \nof  a  GIB?  How  are  its  on-lending  activities  with  other  banking  and  non-banking \ninstitutions structured and managed? \n\nNevertheless,  leveraging  the  financial  assets  and  lending  capability  of  the  IREDA  \nto  increase  green  infrastructure  projects  would  enable  further  channeling  of  finance \ntoward  meeting the  Paris  climate target.  Currently,  IREDA  is  categorized  as  a sector-\nspecific  development  financial  institution  (DFI)  and  a  non-banking  financial  institution, \nallowing it to make capital expenditure on new green products, approve modernization \nmeasures,  and  make  power  purchase  agreements  without  government  approval  on \ndeals up to a limit of $80 million. A larger mandate as a GIB would allow it to harness \ndomestic  bond  markets,  deploying  international  funding  through  such  facilities  as  the \nGreen Climate Fund. In addition, currency swap and hedging could be undertaken by \nIREDA with other designated GIBs in Japan, Europe, and the US. This would allow it to \nissue  credit  guarantees  and  mobilize  greater  additional  lines  of  finance  to  provide  \nlow-cost longer-term financing in India. Another crucial aspect would require IREDA to \nmake amendments in its operating guidelines to improve its performance, bringing it on \na par with other GIBs operating globally, including, but not limited to: (i) revision of the \nexisting  lending  guidelines  for  approval  of  projects  eligible  for  financing  under  green \ninfrastructure;  (ii)  establishing  monitoring,  reporting,  and  verification  procedures  and \nprocesses  for  approved  projects;  (iii)  eliminating  barriers  that  have  prevented  the \nparticipation of other institutional and foreign investors.. \n\n6.  CAPITALIZING JAPAN\u2019S PRIVATE FINANCE \n\nSUPPORT FOR GREEN INVESTMENTS IN INDIA  \n\nTo add to India\u2019s list of solar projects, these now include the loan agreement between \nthe  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  and  SBG  Cleantech,  a  clean-\nenergy joint venture between Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group, India\u2019s Bharti Enterprises, and \nTaipei,China\u2019s  Foxconn  Technology  Group, for  project finance. This  is  the first  time  a \nloan  has  been  co-financed  with  a  Japanese  commercial  bank,  Mizuho  Bank,  and  its \nfinancing  portion  will  be  insured  by  Nippon  Export  and  Investment  Insurance  (NEXI). \n\n19 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 870 \n \n\nDavid and Venkatachalam \n\nJBIC  is  using  this  financing  to  increase  the  global  competitiveness  of  Japanese \ncompanies,  and  promote  green  investments  in  India.  Earlier  in  2012,  JBIC  signed  \nan  untied  loan  agreement  with  other  Japanese  private  institutions,  in  aggregate  \nco-financing  up  to  $300  million  (JBIC  portion:  $180  million)  with  ICICI  Bank,  India\u2019s \nlargest  private  bank  incorporated  in  India.  The  loan  was  co-financed  with  Sumitomo \nMitsui  Banking  Corporation  (SMBC;  lead  arranger)  and  the  Bank  of  Tokyo-Mitsubishi \nUFJ,  with  JBIC  providing  a  guarantee  for  its  co-financed  portion.  The  loan  was \nextended  to  finance  green  energy  projects  in  the  renewable  energy  and  energy \nefficiency  sector  in  India.  This  follows  similar  JBIC  agreements  signed  in  2011  with \nICICI  Bank  in  support  of  its  financing  of  environmentally  related  projects.

CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS  \n\nWhile  it  is  clear  that  many  emerging  economies,  such  as  India,  and  advanced \ncountries,  such  as  Japan,  are  adopting  innovative  approaches  to  financing  the  clean \nenergy transition, it is equally clear that the potential to harness private capital through \nconcessional  PPPs  and  GIBs  is  opportune.  Experiences  from  the  UK  and  Germany \nconfirm that investment and finance through such channels serve optimally to advance \nthe transition. \n\nIndia  is  committed  to  speeding  up  the  transition  through  PPPs.  For  countries  like \nJapan, banking is the focus of green financing efforts. However, in both the countries\u2019 \ncapital  markets,  institutional  investors,  such  as  insurance  and  pension  funds,  are  \nalso  considering  the  development  of  green  bonds  as  complimentary  to  PPP  and  \nGIB approaches. \n\nFollowing  the  ratification  of  the  Paris  agreement,  emerging  economies  such  as  India \nare  taking  actions  that  will  help  accelerate  investments  in  low-carbon  infrastructure. \nWhile  PPPs  and  GIBs  differ  in  name,  scope,  and  approach,  they  share  the  following \ncore characteristics: a mandate focusing mainly on mobilizing private investment using \ntransaction \ninterventions \nstructures  and  market  expertise;  independent  authority;  a  focus  on  cost  effectiveness \nand public\u2013private win-win. \n\nto  mitigate  risks  and  enable \n\ntransactions; \n\ninnovative \n\nBoth concessional PPPs and GIBs can address investment gaps for projects with very \nlarge upfront capital costs, as well as gaps arising when lending costs are too high or \nwhen there is a limited source of public capital. GIBs also perform a de-risking role to \nmobilize  the  investment  of  private  capital  in  low-carbon  projects.  Concessional  PPPs \nand GIBs can also foster knowledge in the area in the case that country-level specialist \nexpertise  does  not  exist,  enabling  better  assessment  of  risks,  the  creation  and \nstandardization of innovative de-risking instruments, and then the diffusion of this new \nknowledge  throughout  the  industry.  PPPs,  through  co-financing  large-scale  projects, \nensure  they  \u201ccrowd  in\u201d  additional  private  finance.  GIBs  also  take  on  the  risky  role  of \nsupporting  \u201cfirst  or  early  mover\u201d  projects,  investing  in  technologies  that  need  to  be \ntested or scaled in the context of the local regulatory and financial environment. They \ncan also support new green technologies, new business models, or new entrants, such \nas a first-time developer or equipment supplier. \n\nKey  areas  with  potential  for  enhancing  Japan\u2013India  cooperation  in  support  of  PPPs \nand GIBs include the following. \n\n\u2022  They  can  enable  market  education  and  capacity  building  for  green  PPPs  and \nGIBs,  building  learning  networks  between  Japanese  and  Indian  stakeholders, \nwhich will play a key role in scaling up initiatives. It may be useful for institutions \nlike the JBIC to map the broad set of domestic policy initiatives and regulatory \nreforms that could be taken up by the emerging markets, taking India as a test \nbed. Such a roadmap building exercise could assess what works and where the \ngaps  are,  including  overlaps  and  opportunities  for  further  improving  financial \nefficiency through knowledge sharing. \n\n \n\n \n\n22 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 870 \n \n\nDavid and Venkatachalam \n\n\u2022  Many  states  in  India  are  making  the  initial  move  into  the  green  finance  space \nthrough concessional PPP- and GIB-funded projects, but they are slowed by a \ngeneral  lack  of  familiarity  among  the  investors  with  the  concept,  definitions, \npurposes, legal framework and advantages of the approaches, and by a lack of \nadvisory services available in the area. Much could be done were a network of \nbanks  and  institutional  investors,  both  within  India  and  between  India  and \nJapan,  to  be  established  to  build  awareness  and  develop  guiding  materials \nbased on best cases. \n\n\u2022  Japan  and  India,  as  members  of  the  G20,  are  using  green  infrastructure \ninvestment  as  a  means  of  coalition  for  engaging  with  overseas  institutional \ninvestors.  Given  the  importance  of  concessional  PPPs  and  GIBs,  a  key \nchallenge is how to support green lending effectively to enable the securitization \nof  those  lending  portfolios  linked  with  a  Monitoring  Reporting  and  Verification \nSystem  (MRV)  on  emission  reductions.  Japan\u2019s  technical  assistance  in  the \ndevelopment of an MRV and how best it could be used to support inbound FDI \nwill be critical. \n\nWhile  the  PPPs  and  GIBs  recognize  the  importance  of  private  capital,  the  nature  of \ngreen  investments  in  India,  as  well  as  in  other  emerging  markets,  involves  a \ncombination of public and private finance. Hence it is also critical to learn lessons from \nJapan and other advanced economies on how to mobilize such blended finance in the \nmost efficient way to meet NDC targets. Many states in India have SPVs that are policy \ninfluenced  or  state  owned,  such  as  pension  funds  linked  to  state-owned  enterprises. \nThese institutions could be a starting point in drawing a new roadmap and articulating \nthe  policy,  regulatory,  and  institutional  development  to  foster  green  private  finance \nthrough limited public finance. \n\n \n\n \n\n23 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 870 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nDavid and Venkatachalam \n\nV.

To  achieve  the  goals, \ngovernments need to make full use of the private sector capacity to unlock much larger flows \nof private investment in low-carbon green infrastructure. This paper focuses on two different \ntypes of mechanism, public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) and green investment banks (GIBs). \nPPPs  are  more  practical  for  countries  that  have  robust  demand,  and  are  complemented  \nby  strong  institutions  and  governance,  protection  of  investments,  and  dispute  resolution \nmechanisms.  In  contrast,  the  other  options  for  green  investments  should  use  innovative \ntransactions,  risk-reduction  structures,  and  market  expertise.  Although  their  common \nobjective is to upscale low-carbon investment, both PPPs and GIBs have been established \nin  a  variety  of  national  contexts  to  achieve  a  range  of  goals,  including  access  to \nconcessional  capital  at  lower  interest  rates  and  longer  tenures  for  green  investments.  This \npaper examines the rationale, mandates, and financing activities of these two categories of \nfinancial  architecture  within  the  context  of  India  and  Japan.  It  provides  stocktaking  of  the \nactual and potential use of these two approaches, and for strengthening bilateral cooperation \nbetween India and Japan. \n \nKeywords: climate change, clean energy, green infrastructure, green investment bank, \npublic\u2013private partnership \n \nJEL Classification: F21, F34, G29, Q28 \n \n", " \n"]}
